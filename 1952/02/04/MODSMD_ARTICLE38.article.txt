# Bob Kurland Tips in 20 to Sink Stanford, 78-74; Braves Win Two More
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
Stanford's red-hot JV's teamed
up with the second-team Stanford
varsity over the weekend to com
pletely roll over Hartnell JC of Sa
linas and hapless Modesto JC.
The second-string varsity, com
monly called the VJV's or pseudo-
Braves, played both fir.->t halves.
Against Hartnell, they immediately
started in workman-like fashion to
annihilate the enemy.
Hartnell was outclassed imme
diately, and the VJV's rolled up
a convincing 17-7 half-time score
and led by as much as 2G to 11
toward the end of the second
quarter. A last-minute Hartnell
rally bror, ht them to within II
points of the Cards, 2(>-15.
The second hall saw the high
scoring Braves take over and con
tinue the shellacking. Lc-d by G-ft.
7-in. Russ Lawler and second
stringers Eric Wittenberg, Howard
Schwartz, and Jim Westphal, the
Braves put the pressure on and
amassed a 43-28 lead at the end ol
the third quarter.
Hartnell was helpless against the
flood of fresh substitutes continu
ally flowing from Coach Gus Cha
valas's bench, and finally capitu
lated by 27 points, 07 to 40.
High point man for the game
was Wittenbivg with eight points,
Jim Adams of Hartnell was sec
find with seven points, and
Schwartz was (bird with six, to tie
Hartnell's George Steinbach and
Paul Ledgerwood. Twenty - two
men played for the Cards.
Saturday night's game was even

more of a slaughter. Modesto's de
liberate offense was deliberate, but
hardly an offense. The second-team
varsity started again and, in one of
the most one - sided games ever
played in the Pavilion, ran to a
21-4 first - quarter score. Slowing
down slightly in the second quarter,
the half-time 4 score was only 35 to 9,
and the worst was yet to come.
With the introduction of the real
Braves at the start of the second
half, Modesto picked up as they
scored 10 points to the Braves' 1G in
the third quarter to make the score
£1 to 19.
The fourth quarter was the
clincher. Led by Wittenberg and
Roger Irvine, the Braves out
scored Modesto 21 to 1, which
probably could go down in the
record books as the most one
sidede 10 minutes in basketball.
Final score was 75 to 20.
Wittenberg was again high man
with 12 points, followed by Irvine
and Don DoLong with eight. Again
over 20 men saw action . for the
Braves.
Stanford's superior height on the
boards and superior speed and team
play kept their opponents' score low
on both nights. Neither opponent

took an offensive rebound in the
two games.
The second-string varsity start
ing lineup had Gary Andrews and
George Zaninovich at the forwards,
Don DeLong at center, and Bruce
Iverson and Paul Johnson at the
guards.
The Braves starting lineup hail
Dick Carver and Irvine at the
forwards, Russ Lawler at center
Friday afternoon and Don Brewer
Saturday night, and Jim Johnson
and Wayne Lockhart at the
guards. Lawler hurl Ins hand in
Friday's game and didn't suit up
Suiu rday.


REBOUND—One of the highlights
of Stanford's near win over the
great Phillips Oilers last Saturday
was the performance of Stanford's
slow-breaking second string. The
team of Don DeLong, Paul John
son, Gary Andrews, Bruce Iver
son, and George Zaninovich held
their own against the Oklahoma
giants while resting the first team.

Stanford's red-hot JV's teamed
up with the second-team Stanford
varsity over the weekend to com
pletely roll over Hartnell JC of Sa
linas and hapless Modesto JC.
The second-string varsity, com
monly called the VJV's or pseudo-
Braves, played both fir.->t halves.
Against Hartnell, they immediately
started in workman-like fashion to
annihilate the enemy.
Hartnell was outclassed imme
diately, and the VJV's rolled up
a convincing 17-7 half-time score
and led by as much as 2G to 11
toward the end of the second
quarter. A last-minute Hartnell
rally bror, ht them to within II
points of the Cards, 2(>-15.
The second hall saw the high
scoring Braves take over and con
tinue the shellacking. Lc-d by G-ft.
7-in. Russ Lawler and second
stringers Eric Wittenberg, Howard
Schwartz, and Jim Westphal, the
Braves put the pressure on and
amassed a 43-28 lead at the end ol
the third quarter.
Hartnell was helpless against the
flood of fresh substitutes continu
ally flowing from Coach Gus Cha
valas's bench, and finally capitu
lated by 27 points, 07 to 40.
High point man for the game
was Wittenbivg with eight points,
Jim Adams of Hartnell was sec
find with seven points, and
Schwartz was (bird with six, to tie
Hartnell's George Steinbach and
Paul Ledgerwood. Twenty - two
men played for the Cards.
Saturday night's game was even

more of a slaughter. Modesto's de
liberate offense was deliberate, but
hardly an offense. The second-team
varsity started again and, in one of
the most one - sided games ever
played in the Pavilion, ran to a
21-4 first - quarter score. Slowing
down slightly in the second quarter,
the half-time 4 score was only 35 to 9,
and the worst was yet to come.
With the introduction of the real
Braves at the start of the second
half, Modesto picked up as they
scored 10 points to the Braves' 1G in
the third quarter to make the score
£1 to 19.
The fourth quarter was the
clincher. Led by Wittenberg and
Roger Irvine, the Braves out
scored Modesto 21 to 1, which
probably could go down in the
record books as the most one
sidede 10 minutes in basketball.
Final score was 75 to 20.
Wittenberg was again high man
with 12 points, followed by Irvine
and Don DoLong with eight. Again
over 20 men saw action . for the
Braves.
Stanford's superior height on the
boards and superior speed and team
play kept their opponents' score low
on both nights. Neither opponent

took an offensive rebound in the
two games.
The second-string varsity start
ing lineup had Gary Andrews and
George Zaninovich at the forwards,
Don DeLong at center, and Bruce
Iverson and Paul Johnson at the
guards.

REBOUND—One of the highlights
of Stanford's near win over the
great Phillips Oilers last Saturday
was the performance of Stanford's
slow-breaking second string. The
team of Don DeLong, Paul John

their own against the Oklahoma
giants while resting the first team.
