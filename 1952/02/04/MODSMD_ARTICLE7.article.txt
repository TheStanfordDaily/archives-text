# Sproul Defends Daily Cal 'Advisorship'
## 
### SUE WHEAT 
Dr. Itobcrt Gordon Sproul de
nied that Cal's newspaper, the
Daily Californian, would be sub
ject to censorship under the re
cently approved Advisory Board,
in an interview with The Daily,
Saturday.
The president of the University
of California said the board will
serve in an advisory capacity only,
and that an attempt will be made
to "keep things in the hands of
the Daily Cal."
The paper's staff, he said, will
be free to override the advice of
Ihe board, but upon doing so, full
responsibility will fall upon the
stall's shoulders.
"There is a lack of responsi
bility on the part of student
journalists," Sproul said. "They
must be responsible to more than
six members of the senior stall,"
he added in reference to the Daily
Cal's senior editorial board.
"We have advisory boards in
nearly every field of student ac

tivity already," he said. He point
ed out that there was no reason
why such a board couldn't per
tain to journalistic activity also.
Sproul felt that the Daily Cal,
like any other organization or
professional group, "will benefit
from seeking advice from a body
larger, more representative, and
more experienced than itself."
"Propaganda, misinformation,
and false statements" were con
tained in the Cal paper's articles
that Rave rise to the problem of
a board, Sproul stated. That the
publication of these articles was
bad judgment, the Daily Cal now
admits, he said. vqMk
The disputed arti>H re writ
ten and contributed hy Cal stu
dent and non-staff member Rob
ert Blauner who spent eight days
in Germany last summer.
When questioned on the im
portance of presenting both sides
of an issue, Sproul admitted thp*
a paper should be free to print
the facts of most issues express

ing both viewpoints. But with
Communism, he drew the line. He
described Communism as an in
ternational intrigue, the methods
of which do not embody the fair
presentation of facts, but rather,
the distortion of them. As far as
Communism goes, Sproul said,
"It's out."
Sproul will choose the Daily
Cal's advisory board from a list
of names to be drawn up by Ed
Welch, director of student activi
ties. The list will include names
representing faculty, student gov
ernment, the Daily Californian,
the administration, and the alum
ni.
The University president
claimed that throughout the reg
ents and executive committee
sessions he defended the Daily
Californian and that he "will Â«on
tinue to defend it."
"As to direction (of the Daily
Cal) by me or ex-eom or the
alumni, I am directly opposed,"
he said.
