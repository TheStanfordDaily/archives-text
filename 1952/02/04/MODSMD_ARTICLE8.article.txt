# Traffic Tragedies Hit Farm
## Russell Thompson Killed in Head-on 
### 
One Stanford student was killed
and another critically injured Fri
day afternoon when their Yoscmite
bound car suffered a head-on colli
sion with a heavily loaded truck 12
miles out of Merced.
Russell Thompson was killed in
stantly, and Robert Corwin was
badly crushed when their car and
the truck collided. Corwin is now
in Merced Hospital hovering be
tween life and death.
A third passenger in the car, Miss
Lynn Duck bury of Stanford, es
caped serious injury and was re
leased from the hospital yesterday.
Thompson was a senior at Stan
ford and took part in many campus
dramatic activities, including the
1951 Gaieties. A major in art, he
lived at Stern Hall. His home was
in Needham, Mass.
According to Highway Patrol re
ports, the auto, driven by Corwin,
met the truck head on when the
truck suddenly swung from its lane
along a narrow, two - lane bridge
outside the valley town.
Both truck and car wet e demol
ished in the crash, which shoved the
auto's dash board into the two Stan
ford men.
Corwin's condition is critical, as
"many ribs were fractured and air
has penetrated the lung cavity." If
he lives, major surgery will be re
quired, Merced Hospital doctors say.
Miss Duckbury was painfully
gashed about the face, but doctors
said her condition was not serious.
The Farm trio was heading to
ward Badger Pass and a weekend
of skiing when the crash occurred.
Funeral services for Thompson
will be held in Needham.
