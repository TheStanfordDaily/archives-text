# Korean Truce Talks Approach Armistice
## 
### 
TOKYO, Tuesday, Feb. 5 (UP)—
Allied and Communist bargaining
teams rsced the clock at Panmun
jom today to wind up all "minor"
Korean truce differences before a
full-dress session of the negotiators
tacklas the fifth and last item on tiie
armistice program tomorrow.
The long-stalled truce talks were
officially reported moving closer to
ward an armistice within the fore
seeable future as concessions ri
pened into a number of agreements
on the exchange of war prisoners.
However, Radio Peiping today
agreed with United Nations Rear
Admiral Ruthven E. Libby that on
the basic issue of voluntary repatri
ation of prisoners both sides were
"180 degrees apart" and in no mood
to budge. Nevertheless it was hoped
this topic could be turned over to
staff officers for "detailed imple
mentation" today or tomorrow.
The subcommittee studying pris
oner exchange and the group of
staff officers working on supervi
sion of an armistice met separately
at 11 a.m. (6 p.m. PST Monday).
Optimistic Agreements
A sunburst of agreements on
truce problems yesterday drew from
the official Allied spokesman the
most optimistic appraisal of the
conference he has made in recent
weeks.
The main truce teams scheduled
a full-dress meetinjg tomorrow to
begin work on the fifth and final
item of the armistice program, the
catch-all recommendations on what
to do about Korea after a truce.
Sub - delegates agreed on seven
and one-half of nine points in a
plan for exchanging war prisoners.
Rear Adm. R. E. Libby called the
session "one of the pleasante.~t
meetings we ever had" and added:
"For the first time I think we are
in a position to settle the nuts and
bolts of the situation. I think we
can get together and write the rest
of the agreement."
Making Progress
In the staff officer study of ar
mistice supervision, the Allies and
Communists were reported narrow
ing the field of disagreement. The
Allies offered to cut down their ro
tation demand and the number of
ports of entry to be inspected.
Brig. Gen William P. Nuckols, the
generally cautious official spokes
man, said last night after studying
the day's developments:
"We have moved closer to an ar
mistice the last few days by virtue
of detailed agreement reached by
staff officers on item three (armi
stice supervision) and general indi
cation of agreement on most of the
principles of item four (prisoner
exchange).
Want Armistice
"The fact that the Communists
agreed to initial talks on item five
(recommendations) is indicative of
the fact that they want an armi
stice within the foreseeable future."
But Nuckols emphasized that the
negotiators still had not agreed on
the two issues which deadlocked the
conference — voluntary repatriation
of prisoners and building air fields
during an armistice — and new
points were bound to show up
| under the new recommendations
item.
Under it the Reds were believed
certain to reopen their demands for
withdrawal of all foreign troopj
from Korea at once, and an imme
diate peace conference.
