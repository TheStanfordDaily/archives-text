### DICK McLEAN 
IS STANFORD GOING TO THE DOGS?
Before my mental crackup which Pete Grothe
(rhymes with both) prophesized last week, I feel the
urge in my bones for one fast crusade. It's for man's
only real friend.
Resolve: The current University ban on dogs on
campus is the greatest miscarriage of justice since
some browbeaten husbands gave the vote to women -
kind, it's not that I've got something against women,

it's just that I like dogs.
Do you remember what a dog
7neant lo you when you were a
kid? lie was love and security
and a feeling that you were im
portant, wanted. But you grew
up and left your friend behind.
And what did you got in return?
Nothing but adult psychosis and
the privilege of spending your
on those skittish, unreliable
creatures called women.
And now the University had

aided and abetted this plan which is promulgated by
the International Sisterhood of Women. (You think
the communists are well organized?) No dogs on
campus No more of those fine, faithful creatures to
pat on the head. No loving lick on the hand when
you throw a kind word or a E'riskie. No sir, no dogs
on campus. University ruling. Cost you fifty hones
(dollars) if they catch you.
But let us analyze I his new ruling. Who made it?
Why? Undoubtedly it was a man but I'll he( he was
a married man. And a married man is unfortunately
not free. lie flunks he's free but in reality he's only
an auxiliary member of the "Sisterhood."
We had a dog where I lived last year. A fine, hand
some, intelligent ... no that's a lie. He was a
t scroungy, funny-looking mongrel. But he was a fine
i dog all the same. His legs were short, his ancestry
' doubtful, his color motley, his intelligence dim. But
j (leorge was a good dog. If you met him on campus,
> he always wagged a stumpy hello. (He didn't have

much of a tail.) When you sat alone in the front,
room after a hell of a day, it was always good old
George who padded over to give you a happy wel
come. True, it was a furry, dog-smelling welcome.
But somebody cared.
But they (the University) took George away.
"A rilling," they said. "It lias been decreed." So
they fined lis (lily burlis and we had to retire the
"Big Fellow" with an alum who lived in San Carlos.
Maybe he is happier but we're not.
What's left now? The house is cleaner—no white
and black hairs on the rug. It smells better —no
healthy dog smell. No more, "Quick! Hide that damn
dog. The Police Chief's coming." But it's not the
same. You sit down on the clean couch of a lonely
afternoon and just sit and still feel lonely. What else
can you do? You fish around until you've got a
handful of nickles and hit the old colfee date trail—
a long, expensive frustrating trail at best.
So what if you do get a coffee date; i('s still not
as good as owning a faithful hound. Dogs have been
known to starve to death over the graves of their
masters. Around here it's not uncommon to get a
girl in from a date at 11:30 to see the second string
late-dater waiting on the porch for his turn. An
other advantage of dogs is that they don't drink
anything more expensive than beer.
And who is the devil in this woodpile? The Uni
versity under the secret domination of the 1.5.0. W.
The women know. They watch those things. Give a
man a little contentment and lie doesn't need them.
They know.
The misguided day that the Administration issued
their prohibitive edict on dogs another Jink was
forged in the chain of Masculine Enslavement.
And we, the poor bachelors, are caught in the
terrible web. Not enough girls, not enough pretty
ones of the few we have, and no dogs.
Gentlemen of the Board of Trustees, I ask you: take
down the "No Dogs Allowed" sign that hangs from
our main gates. Repaint the fireplugs. Prove to the
world that Stanford is not going to the dogs; it is
letting the dogs come to it.

IS STANFORD GOING TO THE DOGS?
Before my mental crackup which Pete Grothe
(rhymes with both) prophesized last week, I feel the
urge in my bones for one fast crusade. It's for man's
only real friend.
Resolve: The current University ban on dogs on
campus is the greatest miscarriage of justice since
some browbeaten husbands gave the vote to women -
kind, it's not that I've got something against women,

it's just that I like dogs.
Do you remember what a dog
7neant lo you when you were a
kid? lie was love and security
and a feeling that you were im
portant, wanted. But you grew
up and left your friend behind.
And what did you got in return?
Nothing but adult psychosis and
the privilege of spending your
on those skittish, unreliable
creatures called women.
And now the University had

aided and abetted this plan which is promulgated by
the International Sisterhood of Women. (You think
the communists are well organized?) No dogs on
campus No more of those fine, faithful creatures to
pat on the head. No loving lick on the hand when
you throw a kind word or a E'riskie. No sir, no dogs
on campus. University ruling. Cost you fifty hones
(dollars) if they catch you.
But let us analyze I his new ruling. Who made it?
Why? Undoubtedly it was a man but I'll he( he was
a married man. And a married man is unfortunately
not free. lie flunks he's free but in reality he's only
an auxiliary member of the "Sisterhood."
We had a dog where I lived last year. A fine, hand
some, intelligent ... no that's a lie. He was a
t scroungy, funny-looking mongrel. But he was a fine
i dog all the same. His legs were short, his ancestry
' doubtful, his color motley, his intelligence dim. But

ones of the few we have, and no dogs.

IS STANFORD GOING TO THE DOGS?
Before my mental crackup which Pete Grothe
(rhymes with both) prophesized last week, I feel the
urge in my bones for one fast crusade. It's for man's
only real friend.
Resolve: The current University ban on dogs on
campus is the greatest miscarriage of justice since
some browbeaten husbands gave the vote to women -
kind, it's not that I've got something against women,

it's just that I like dogs.
Do you remember what a dog
7neant lo you when you were a
kid? lie was love and security
and a feeling that you were im
portant, wanted. But you grew
up and left your friend behind.
And what did you got in return?
Nothing but adult psychosis and
the privilege of spending your
on those skittish, unreliable
creatures called women.
And now the University had

aided and abetted this plan which is promulgated by
the International Sisterhood of Women. (You think
the communists are well organized?) No dogs on
campus No more of those fine, faithful creatures to
pat on the head. No loving lick on the hand when
you throw a kind word or a E'riskie. No sir, no dogs
on campus. University ruling. Cost you fifty hones
(dollars) if they catch you.
But let us analyze I his new ruling. Who made it?
Why? Undoubtedly it was a man but I'll he( he was
a married man. And a married man is unfortunately
not free. lie flunks he's free but in reality he's only
an auxiliary member of the "Sisterhood."
We had a dog where I lived last year. A fine, hand
some, intelligent ... no that's a lie. He was a
t scroungy, funny-looking mongrel. But he was a fine
i dog all the same. His legs were short, his ancestry
' doubtful, his color motley, his intelligence dim. But
j (leorge was a good dog. If you met him on campus,
> he always wagged a stumpy hello. (He didn't have

much of a tail.) When you sat alone in the front,
room after a hell of a day, it was always good old
George who padded over to give you a happy wel
come. True, it was a furry, dog-smelling welcome.
But somebody cared.
But they (the University) took George away.
"A rilling," they said. "It lias been decreed." So
they fined lis (lily burlis and we had to retire the
"Big Fellow" with an alum who lived in San Carlos.
Maybe he is happier but we're not.
What's left now? The house is cleaner—no white
and black hairs on the rug. It smells better —no
healthy dog smell. No more, "Quick! Hide that damn
dog. The Police Chief's coming." But it's not the
same. You sit down on the clean couch of a lonely
afternoon and just sit and still feel lonely. What else
can you do? You fish around until you've got a
handful of nickles and hit the old colfee date trail—
a long, expensive frustrating trail at best.
So what if you do get a coffee date; i('s still not
as good as owning a faithful hound. Dogs have been
known to starve to death over the graves of their
masters. Around here it's not uncommon to get a
girl in from a date at 11:30 to see the second string
late-dater waiting on the porch for his turn. An
other advantage of dogs is that they don't drink
anything more expensive than beer.
And who is the devil in this woodpile? The Uni
versity under the secret domination of the 1.5.0. W.
The women know. They watch those things. Give a
man a little contentment and lie doesn't need them.
They know.
The misguided day that the Administration issued
their prohibitive edict on dogs another Jink was
forged in the chain of Masculine Enslavement.
And we, the poor bachelors, are caught in the
terrible web. Not enough girls, not enough pretty
ones of the few we have, and no dogs.
Gentlemen of the Board of Trustees, I ask you: take
down the "No Dogs Allowed" sign that hangs from
our main gates. Repaint the fireplugs. Prove to the
world that Stanford is not going to the dogs; it is
letting the dogs come to it.
