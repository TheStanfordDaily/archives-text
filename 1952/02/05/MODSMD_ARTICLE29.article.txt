« "vince a traveller with Arab visas on his passport
' csr.not enter Israel (or vice-versa) we could not drive
t '
, through to Egypt. Instead we got ourselves and the
»car steerage passage on a boat from Beirut to Port
if' :,|
, Our first glimpse of Egypt was in the waters of the
■ Mediterranean, turned a muddy brown by the out
'pourings of the Nile. Later, in Caiio, v/e were to see
«the same muddy water, this time on tap. If we let a
Jglass ol water stand for a few minutes, sediment
would filter to the bottom.
i The Suez Canal was fascinating. Ships from all
' far and distant places motionlcssly moving. Time
i honored Egyptian <ailboats on the fresh-water ca
» nal. And nearby the camels, and lhe date-palms
\ heavy with fruit. And the rippled hills of sand.
» Driving the length of the canal, we passed through
'the extensive Biitish army and RAF installations at
, Fay id, the focal point of British strength in Egypt
♦today. After visiting the strange and ugly town of
JSaez, we crossed a strip of desert to reach Cairo.
, It was in Egypt—in Port Said, in Suez, in Cairo—
'that we felt the only hostility we were to notice on
'the entire journey. For the most part unspoken and
only implied, it was nevertheless there. A student
loflered to help us several times, saying he was em
ployed by the government to look after foreign
tourists. We finally did get in trouble with the po
lice for taking a picture of a bridge over the Nile.
The pyramids were marvelous—and the nose
* less Sphinx. You could see them from far away,
■ majestic, old, great -the dream of a lifetime. We
< \plotrd the inside and then climbed to the top of
, the C. rent Pyramid. Pygmies in this grandiose
dieadness, we ga/ed down upon the other pyramids

and the sudden lush beauty of the Nile Valley bound
by (be sands of the desert.
Around El Alaniein and in western Egypt and up
to Tobruk in eastern Libya the desert was littered
with the remains ol warfare camouflaged tanks with
guns pointing skyward and treads falling off, over
turned trucks, destroyed jeeps. We had been warned
never to leave the road on account of the mines.
Some British children in Tobruk had been killed a
few weeks betore when they stumbled across a
buried mine.
In Libya v/e visited Cyrene, Leptis Magna, and
other ancient Roman cities amazingly well-preserved
by the dry climate. Later Italian colonial building
was also much in evidence—with big signs reading
DUCE or CREDERE, OB BED I HE, COMBAT! ERE
but it didn't look as if it would last as long.
By this time our car was slowly disenthraling,
especially the tires, under the heavy pounding from
the Libyan roads. Our only spare blew when we
were about 30 miles from the nearest hick town
We spent the night on the desert.
The next morning I hopped on the one-a~day Arab
lorry in the company of 1(11) Arabs and two flat tires.
They were very interested in me, my watch, and poli
tics. The only man who could speak any English at
all asked me how many people were in America.
When I answered l. r >o million, he laughed, saying
Russia had 400 million.
Then he asked me was Stalin America? I said no,
Stalin was Russia. Who was America then, Roose
velt? Yes, I said, and Truman (but that didn't seem
to ring a bell, so I didn't press the point). AI Km that
we discussed the comparative advantages of American
and Russian rifles and the life of a bricklayer in the
United States.
We finally got on our way again and, passing
through the lovely oasis town of Misurata, reached
Tripoli. We headed straight for the big U.S. air base,
Wheel us Eield, and were glad to lie back again in
the land of jets and hamburgers.
