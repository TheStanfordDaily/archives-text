# Farm Critic Cites Three Local Flicks
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
A trio of pictures this week
prove themselves noteworthy
for this or that reason, and while
none of them can be called
great, only one is downright
poor.
"The Whistle at Eaton Falls," of
fereJ by the Park, is perhaps the
most rewarding. In this film, Louis
de Roehemont ("Boomerang," "Lost
Boundaries") turns his quiet, steady
hand to a study of conflict between
workers and administrators in a
plastic factory upon which the very
livelihood of Eaton Falls depends.
Scrupulously unbiased, he deals out
both praiae and blame to each side,
and concludes that trust and fair
play alone can solve snarled labor
management problems in the United
States. The picture was filmed en
tirely in New England, which brings
to its engrossing story an air of
absolute reality.
Second Park Feature
"I Want You," also at the Park, is
Samuel Goldwyn's latest hunk of
red - blooded, two - fisted, 100 per
cent Americana, which, despite its
high budget and glossy finish, fails
tediously. From behind one of
America's healthiest bankrolls, Mil
lionaire Goldwyn reminds us that
anyone who earns over $5,000 a year
is automatically a rascal and a
threat to democracy, and that only
the lower income groups are fine,
upstanding citizens.

Love, however, seems to conquer
all, even making Rich Girl Peggy
Dow (who has committed the un
pardonable sin of going to college)
worthy of Poor Buy Farley Gran
ger (who nevertheless sports as
racy a wardrobe as the screen has
ever known). In a flurry of Hag
waving, practically everyone winds
up in the Army, and we are made
to understand that with the likes of
Granger and Dana Andrews on our
side, America is safe. Dorothy Mt-
Guire and Mildred Dunnock are to
be admired lor doing more justice
than is deserved to writer Irvin
Shaw's screen-play.
Stanford Show
"Another Man's Poi on," at the
Stanford, brings us Bette Davis a;;
an authoress who has written one
murder mystery too many. II the
part is unlikely to add new laurels
to her already sizeable collection, it
nevertheless provides her with sev
eral chances to show why she is still
one of Hollywood's few great ac
tresses.
As a drama of suspense, the pic
ture is enticingly conceived, well
put together, and nicely photo
graphed against a genuine Scottish
background. Emelyn Williams is
entirely too pat as a nosey doctor,
but Gary Merrill and assorted oth
ers turn in good performances, and
these, plus a number of interesting
new twists and an adequate supply
of moments calculated to raise the
blood pressure, make "Another
Man's Poison" an amusing trip to
the movies.
