"A SPORTING CHANCE"
Intercollegiate soccer in the Buy Area as well as on a national scale got
a biy boost over tUe weekend from the very successful Soccer Bowl staged
by Baghdad on the Bay's Junior C. of C. The game, in which Temple shut
out USF 2 to 0 to win the National Collegiate Soccer Championship, attracted
a crowd of 10,000 fans, not much for Kezar, but a record for college soccer.
The sponsors have already said they hope to make it an annual aflair.
Since they should have made expenses and maybe a nickel or two more
from the first game, it looks as though they will be able to carry through
with their future plans.
Couple the templing bail of a National Championship game right in our
back yard with the new soccer stadium in Hulhoa Park and you have a
lot of incentive to expand the soccer program in the Hay Area colleges.
Stanford, of course, is one of these, and who knows but what we might
make it to the Soccer Howl next year even it we can t travel to that beau
tiful southern land of milk and honey again.
All the chatter on soccer reminds us (ala the late great Harry B.) of a
letter a wise old Yale grad, dripping with Ivy League Culture, wrote to the
Chronic Green Sheet, advocating the encouragement of soccer as a means
to "de-emphasize" (Migosh, what an overused scarecrow) football. Although
we can't see his reason, we would like some more flag-waving cm the Farm
for this international soccer fudball, cause its u helluva lot of fun to play.
Now that we are considering that great tin god "DeEmphasis," we were
out to chat with Swim Coach Tom Haynie the other day and got tangled up
with him in an hour's worth ol "what's wrong with sports.
Generally speaking, the results of the conversation sounded something
like this: The whole trouble with sports is the newspaper buildups (gross
generalization)- If 'he newspapers (lid not devote so much time to glamor
izing the Names and the IJ it* Games we would not have this trouble with
athletic recruiting, etc. (still statement without fact basis). But it is a hard
economic fact that newspapers are published beca'use people wish to read
what's in the m(except in the case ol those which are published because
someone wants the people to read what's in them).
There are certain sports people want to read about, lo see glamorized,
lo bet on, to watch—like football, baseball, boxing, basketball, track, golf,
and horse racing. These eat up the column inches in the professional grut
sheets. And it's logical, from an economic viewpoint. Also from the view
point of the spectator fan, because he gets to read about what he is in
terested in.
But what about the other sports? College swimming, wrestling, high
school bowling, sailing? They all at various times plea for publicity, for
the natural desire to see their feats v/ritten about. And yet they continue
to get little space, and what space they do get is often poorly and innac
curately filled. But is there any great injustice?
We came lo the conclusion, No. The difference between the two groups
of sports is that most of the people interested in the latter are performers,
not spectators as was the first case. Even though in the case of howling
particularly there may he more participants than there are fans lor say
track, news about knocking down the pins is not interesting from the same
viewpoint as news about the cinders.
So we thought the system was pretty equitable where it is. The par
ticipant sports exchange news and build up their folk lore by word of
mouth and by newsheels devoted to their own particular sport, while the
general spectator public reads in the general newsheets about the spoi l it
likes to watch. What is really news worthy about the so-called minor
spoils continues to make the major tip sheets: stuff like national champion
ships, world records, etc. Everybody ought to be happy, or, if not, at least
realize that the situation is a byproduct of the old law of supply and de
mand. So even though the topic has about as much relation on the sur
face to sports at Stai lord as your reporter has with Ava Gardner, you never
know when Ml' Frankie might get tired.
P.S. In our new job of exchange editor of this scoop sheet, we dug up
a girl sports columnists in the University ol Cincinnati News-Record. She
pens a little gem entitled "No Passes Allowed." (must be getting frustrated).
It explains the intricacies of the various contests to her distaff cohorts as
well as to any makes around who appreciate her humor. Just think, some
body might dig up a gal around here to replace me or Pete Grothe!

make it to the Soccer Howl next year even it we can t travel to that beau
tiful southern land of milk and honey again.
All the chatter on soccer reminds us (ala the late great Harry B.) of a
letter a wise old Yale grad, dripping with Ivy League Culture, wrote to the
Chronic Green Sheet, advocating the encouragement of soccer as a means
to "de-emphasize" (Migosh, what an overused scarecrow) football. Although
we can't see his reason, we would like some more flag-waving cm the Farm
for this international soccer fudball, cause its u helluva lot of fun to play.
Now that we are considering that great tin god "DeEmphasis," we were
out to chat with Swim Coach Tom Haynie the other day and got tangled up
with him in an hour's worth ol "what's wrong with sports.
Generally speaking, the results of the conversation sounded something
like this: The whole trouble with sports is the newspaper buildups (gross
generalization)- If 'he newspapers (lid not devote so much time to glamor
izing the Names and the IJ it* Games we would not have this trouble with
athletic recruiting, etc. (still statement without fact basis). But it is a hard
economic fact that newspapers are published beca'use people wish to read
what's in the m(except in the case ol those which are published because
someone wants the people to read what's in them).
There are certain sports people want to read about, lo see glamorized,
lo bet on, to watch—like football, baseball, boxing, basketball, track, golf,
and horse racing. These eat up the column inches in the professional grut
sheets. And it's logical, from an economic viewpoint. Also from the view
point of the spectator fan, because he gets to read about what he is in
terested in.
But what about the other sports? College swimming, wrestling, high
school bowling, sailing? They all at various times plea for publicity, for
the natural desire to see their feats v/ritten about. And yet they continue
to get little space, and what space they do get is often poorly and innac
curately filled. But is there any great injustice?
We came lo the conclusion, No. The difference between the two groups
of sports is that most of the people interested in the latter are performers,
not spectators as was the first case. Even though in the case of howling
particularly there may he more participants than there are fans lor say
track, news about knocking down the pins is not interesting from the same
viewpoint as news about the cinders.
So we thought the system was pretty equitable where it is. The par
ticipant sports exchange news and build up their folk lore by word of
mouth and by newsheels devoted to their own particular sport, while the
general spectator public reads in the general newsheets about the spoi l it
likes to watch. What is really news worthy about the so-called minor
spoils continues to make the major tip sheets: stuff like national champion
ships, world records, etc. Everybody ought to be happy, or, if not, at least
realize that the situation is a byproduct of the old law of supply and de
mand. So even though the topic has about as much relation on the sur
face to sports at Stai lord as your reporter has with Ava Gardner, you never
know when Ml' Frankie might get tired.
P.S. In our new job of exchange editor of this scoop sheet, we dug up
a girl sports columnists in the University ol Cincinnati News-Record. She
pens a little gem entitled "No Passes Allowed." (must be getting frustrated).
It explains the intricacies of the various contests to her distaff cohorts as
well as to any makes around who appreciate her humor. Just think, some
body might dig up a gal around here to replace me or Pete Grothe!
"A SPORTING CHANCE"
Intercollegiate soccer in the Buy Area as well as on a national scale got
a biy boost over tUe weekend from the very successful Soccer Bowl staged
by Baghdad on the Bay's Junior C. of C. The game, in which Temple shut
out USF 2 to 0 to win the National Collegiate Soccer Championship, attracted
a crowd of 10,000 fans, not much for Kezar, but a record for college soccer.
The sponsors have already said they hope to make it an annual aflair.
Since they should have made expenses and maybe a nickel or two more
from the first game, it looks as though they will be able to carry through
with their future plans.
Couple the templing bail of a National Championship game right in our
back yard with the new soccer stadium in Hulhoa Park and you have a
lot of incentive to expand the soccer program in the Hay Area colleges.

like this: The whole trouble with sports is the newspaper buildups (gross
generalization)- If 'he newspapers (lid not devote so much time to glamor
izing the Names and the IJ it* Games we would not have this trouble with
athletic recruiting, etc. (still statement without fact basis). But it is a hard
economic fact that newspapers are published beca'use people wish to read
what's in the m(except in the case ol those which are published because
someone wants the people to read what's in them).
There are certain sports people want to read about, lo see glamorized,
lo bet on, to watch—like football, baseball, boxing, basketball, track, golf,
and horse racing. These eat up the column inches in the professional grut
sheets. And it's logical, from an economic viewpoint. Also from the view
point of the spectator fan, because he gets to read about what he is in
terested in.
But what about the other sports? College swimming, wrestling, high
school bowling, sailing? They all at various times plea for publicity, for
the natural desire to see their feats v/ritten about. And yet they continue
to get little space, and what space they do get is often poorly and innac
curately filled. But is there any great injustice?
We came lo the conclusion, No. The difference between the two groups
of sports is that most of the people interested in the latter are performers,
not spectators as was the first case. Even though in the case of howling
particularly there may he more participants than there are fans lor say
track, news about knocking down the pins is not interesting from the same
viewpoint as news about the cinders.
So we thought the system was pretty equitable where it is. The par
ticipant sports exchange news and build up their folk lore by word of
mouth and by newsheels devoted to their own particular sport, while the
general spectator public reads in the general newsheets about the spoi l it
likes to watch. What is really news worthy about the so-called minor
spoils continues to make the major tip sheets: stuff like national champion
ships, world records, etc. Everybody ought to be happy, or, if not, at least
realize that the situation is a byproduct of the old law of supply and de
mand. So even though the topic has about as much relation on the sur
face to sports at Stai lord as your reporter has with Ava Gardner, you never
know when Ml' Frankie might get tired.
P.S. In our new job of exchange editor of this scoop sheet, we dug up
a girl sports columnists in the University ol Cincinnati News-Record. She
pens a little gem entitled "No Passes Allowed." (must be getting frustrated).
It explains the intricacies of the various contests to her distaff cohorts as
well as to any makes around who appreciate her humor. Just think, some

"A SPORTING CHANCE"
Intercollegiate soccer in the Buy Area as well as on a national scale got
a biy boost over tUe weekend from the very successful Soccer Bowl staged
by Baghdad on the Bay's Junior C. of C. The game, in which Temple shut
out USF 2 to 0 to win the National Collegiate Soccer Championship, attracted
a crowd of 10,000 fans, not much for Kezar, but a record for college soccer.
The sponsors have already said they hope to make it an annual aflair.
Since they should have made expenses and maybe a nickel or two more
from the first game, it looks as though they will be able to carry through
with their future plans.
Couple the templing bail of a National Championship game right in our
back yard with the new soccer stadium in Hulhoa Park and you have a
lot of incentive to expand the soccer program in the Hay Area colleges.
Stanford, of course, is one of these, and who knows but what we might
make it to the Soccer Howl next year even it we can t travel to that beau
tiful southern land of milk and honey again.
All the chatter on soccer reminds us (ala the late great Harry B.) of a
letter a wise old Yale grad, dripping with Ivy League Culture, wrote to the
Chronic Green Sheet, advocating the encouragement of soccer as a means
to "de-emphasize" (Migosh, what an overused scarecrow) football. Although
we can't see his reason, we would like some more flag-waving cm the Farm
for this international soccer fudball, cause its u helluva lot of fun to play.
Now that we are considering that great tin god "DeEmphasis," we were
out to chat with Swim Coach Tom Haynie the other day and got tangled up
with him in an hour's worth ol "what's wrong with sports.
