## Dean Slices Card Varsity: Only Twenty-three Left 
### DON WEBSTER 
Twenty-three players were
named yesterday by Baseball Coach
Everett Dean as being on this year's
squad, in what will moat likely be
the final player-cut uf the season.
At the same time Dean listed 33
athletes who will make up the JV
Brave team.
Included on the squad are four
catchers, seven pitchers, and eight
infielder3. Though only four out
fielders are listed, several players
l'rom other positions are able to
move there, having had previous
experience in the outfield.
The hurling stall is led by Dean's
three ace hurlers Joe Chez, Rog
Osenbaugh, and Bob Murphy. Chez
will probably be the top pitcher.
Two years ago the tall senior was
picked as the outstanding player,
and last year was troubled, by ill
nes3 for a good part of the season.
Osenbaugh, whose best pitch is a
blazing fast ball, will also see his
share of action. Murphy in the past
has been very effective for several
innings, only to lose hi.s control. If
he is as effective in an entire game
as he has been at times, he may
take over as top man.
The players who may switch to
the outfield are catchers Dick Cor
vine and Ray Swartz and infielders
Jim Agar and A 1 Talboy. They will
sub behind regular backstops Jack
Shepard and Ray Nelson.
Backing up the three chief hurl
ers already mentioned will be Phil
Page, Mike Acker, Ken Brown, and
Roland Hoffman.
On the infielc* crew will be Agar,
Hal Hennacy, Leo Swartz, Art
Abrahamson, Warren Goodrich,
Rich Scramaglia, Owen Powell, and
Talboy. The four regular outfield
ers are Chuck Essegian, Dick Cole,
Hal Skillman, and Dave Rosen -
krantz.
The first game is scheduled for
Feb. l(i, against the Palo Alto Oaks.

Corz in e , first - string varsity
catcher, is shown in his tradi

as one of the four backstops on
the squad, and should spark the
team with his hatting power.

Feb. l(i, against the Palo Alto Oaks.


OPONENTS BEWARE! — Dick
Corz in e , first - string varsity
catcher, is shown in his tradi
tional stance. Corzine was named
as one of the four backstops on
the squad, and should spark the
team with his hatting power.
Twenty-three players were
named yesterday by Baseball Coach
Everett Dean as being on this year's
squad, in what will moat likely be
the final player-cut uf the season.
At the same time Dean listed 33
athletes who will make up the JV
Brave team.
Included on the squad are four
catchers, seven pitchers, and eight
infielder3. Though only four out
fielders are listed, several players
l'rom other positions are able to
move there, having had previous
experience in the outfield.
The hurling stall is led by Dean's
three ace hurlers Joe Chez, Rog
Osenbaugh, and Bob Murphy. Chez
will probably be the top pitcher.
Two years ago the tall senior was
picked as the outstanding player,
and last year was troubled, by ill
nes3 for a good part of the season.
Osenbaugh, whose best pitch is a
blazing fast ball, will also see his
share of action. Murphy in the past
has been very effective for several
innings, only to lose hi.s control. If
he is as effective in an entire game
as he has been at times, he may
take over as top man.
The players who may switch to
the outfield are catchers Dick Cor
vine and Ray Swartz and infielders
Jim Agar and A 1 Talboy. They will
sub behind regular backstops Jack
Shepard and Ray Nelson.
Backing up the three chief hurl
ers already mentioned will be Phil
Page, Mike Acker, Ken Brown, and
Roland Hoffman.
On the infielc* crew will be Agar,
Hal Hennacy, Leo Swartz, Art
Abrahamson, Warren Goodrich,
Rich Scramaglia, Owen Powell, and
Talboy. The four regular outfield
ers are Chuck Essegian, Dick Cole,
Hal Skillman, and Dave Rosen -
krantz.
The first game is scheduled for
Feb. l(i, against the Palo Alto Oaks.
