OAKLAND, Feb. 4 (UP)-Blond
Jackie Jensen, one-time Ail-Amer
ican football player from California,
predicted today he would beat out
Mickey Mantle for Joe DiMaggio's
old spot as center fielder for the
world champion New York Yan
kees.
Jensen, somewhat overlooked in
the race for the spot in view of all
the stories about Mantle, admitted
: that Mantle is "quite a ball plyaer."
. "But 1 think I'll beat him out of
the job," said Jackie. "I feel that
| I'm a better hitter; that I can throw
' better; that I run the bases better
; (although Mickey is very fast); and
that I'm superior in fly catching."
