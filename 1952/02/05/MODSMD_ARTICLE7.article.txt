# ‘Winds of Freedom' Will Aid the Delhi Scholars
## 
### 
(Editor's note: this is the second
of a series describing the recipients
of the funds raised l>y Stanford's
first all-foreign relief drive. The
drive begins this Friday under the
slogan: "Help the Winds of Free
dom Blow!")?
Stanford" students may feed and
clothe a future prime minister of In
dia this year if he attends the Uni
versity of Delhi. Delhi University
was especially chosen for aid by Ex
com because its students have pro
vided much vital Indian leadership,
often taking important government
posts.
The University draws students
from all over India. After the par
tition of India in 11)47, thousands of
refugee students came from Pakistan
to Delhi, having lost parents, money,
and property. Since it was impos
sible for Delhi to provide educational
facilities for these students, the
double shift system was introduced.
By this system, the same set of
regular day staff members taught
the refugee students at night. But,
this scheme was not feasible, so
the Education Ministry set up
three colleges mainly for these
refugee students. One of the new
colleges is the Punjab Camp Col
lege, now one of the biggest edu
cational institutions in Southeast
ern Asia. Three thousand students
are now receiving instruction there
at night, for the college is located
in the buildings of another school
which uses the structures during
the day.
Housing has long been a serious
problem at Delhi. The 25 per cent
allotted to Delhi University from
this relief drive will help build a
hostel for the mass of refugee stu
dents there. Although the Stanford
funds collected in last spring's drive
aided hostel-building, more buildings
are still desperately needed.
A two or three hour trip between
the University and many student's
lodgings is common. Many students
have no lodgings or else live in great
tent cities. Those who have tents
consider themselves lucky—in spite
of the monsoon season.
Although Delhi students are
actively building up their educa
tional system, they are hampered
by the lack of food, medicine,
clothing, and shelter. One of their

biggest problems is the sanitary
conditions. At a refugee camp near
Calcutta, 1,000 persons, many of
them students, died of dysentery
within six months.
The University of Delhi now has
about 4,000 students, including those
in its 16 constituent colleges. Two
of the most important schools of the
university are the Delhi School of
Social Work and the Delhi School

of Economics. The School of Social
Work is perhaps the leading school
of its type in the.Far East-
Stanford funds are helping to fur
nish Indian students with the ma
terial necessities with which to live
and study. Stanford's aid is also
fostering a spirit, of cooperation and
self-help among students in a land
where labor was traditionally con
sidered unworthy of scholars.


'DORM' IN INDIA—The crude brick wall is part of the Delhi
hostel. This refugee student uses his coi as a chair and bed,
while the wire chair plus a pillow is his study table.
