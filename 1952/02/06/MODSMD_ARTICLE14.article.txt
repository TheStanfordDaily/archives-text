# Last 'Papa' Concert Is 'Inspired'
## 
### RON ROSEN 
Pierre Montcux, bidding faiev/ell
to Stanford music lovers, conducted
an inspired program which v/as
given a long standing ovation by a
large audience in Memorial Audi
torium last night
Opening with the Bach Suite in
B Minor for Flute and Strings, the
orchestra turned in a technically
precise performance. Though the
reading by Montcux v/as straight
forward and musicianly, the large
orchestra overpowered the fine flute
playing of Murry Graitzer in many
passages. In this reviewer's opin
ion the orchestra should have been
cut down to the size originally in
tended by the composer.
Master of Debussy
Turning to the Rondes flu Prin
ternps, Montcux showed that he is
still the acknowledged master of
Debussy's music. He revealed a re
markable gift for calling forth all
the musical voces of the orchestra
and fusing them into the proper
proportion .. Never did he allow
anything to interfere with the mel
ody lines in this vast orchestral
painting. The orchestra was a vir
tuoso instrument in this reading,
and the woodwind work v/as out
standing.
The I lindemiIh masterpiece, "Ma
thi; der Maler," offered a vehicle to
further display Monteux's versatile
talents. Showing exceptional feel
ing for this music, he led the or
chestra in a relaxed reading which
still managed to catch all the taut
drama in this twentieth century
classic. Again. Monleux managed to
give the orchestral fabric a lucid
transparency in which all the voices
were brought to the fore without
int.erfei ing with important lines. The
section, "The Temptation of Saint
Anthony," was recreated with all
the savage drama inherent in the
music, with the closing fugue su
perbly performed. This perform
ance must be ranked among this re
viewer's most memorable musical
experiences. As the last organ-like
sonorities were heard, the en
thralled audience realized that it
had heard something that would far
outlast a standard interpretation.
Montcux Relaxes
After the intermission, Monteux
turned in another performance
which was superb in every respect.
He stood on the podium, seemed to
relax and to enjoy the beautiful
playing of his orchestra. He never
drove them. The men of the San
Francisco Symphony seemed to
rath the inspiration and spirit of
their conductor, and they played
with enthusiasm seldom encoun
tered among musicians who have
rendered this work many times.
The first movement revealed an
easy, yet heroic approach to the
grandiose music.
