# Mice and Mold Menace Mailmen
## 
### HADLEY ROFF 
The roof leaks, the combina-j
tion on the boxes won't work,
and mice have nibbled at pack
ages, complain mailmen when
asked, "What's new at the post
office?"
Amplifying the complaints, Clerk
in Charge Louis Gray adds that the
trouble with the post office is that
"there isn't anything new."
Not painted for 20 years and with
the Corporation Yard shrugging ofT
any repair work on the building,
die post office has become smudged ;
and crowded.
Built in 11)00. the 52-ycar-olrl
squat, sandstone huilrfinr? hasn't
kept pace with the lime.. Quar- j
tcrs once ample for Stanford's i
1,000 daily imil-loaH U0 years ago
are far too cramped for today's :
10,000-per-day letter volume.
Not having been remodeled since
its construction, the time-hammered
building is now considered a health j
hazard. Reporting that the employ- I
ee sickness rate is high, the chief |
clerk blames poor ventilation, leak
ing roofs, and overcrowded condi
tions for illness.
The post office's 20-man crew is
cramped into a cluttered area
slightly larger than an average
classroom. Without proper cross
ventilation, the building becomes
dirt-smeared as dust sifts in from
nearby roadways.
Pointing to the brown streaked
walls. Gray says that the rough, un- j
painted walls are impossible to keep
clean.
Chilling drafts and dripping
leaks also plnguc (lie mailmen.
Hoping to keep out (l»<* drafts, 112
workers wedge mail sacks along
(he window ledges. Hut, accord
ing to Gray, waltv still seeps into
the building and a sorting box
containing air mail letters was
soaked two weeks ago.
A further nuisance was added lo
the post office's trouble list recently i
when a bevy of inquisitive mice
scampered into the building. Usurp- i

ing the title of a: a .tint post mas
ter in charge of food panel :, the
mire have gnawer! into several
cooky boxes during the past several
months. The mice menace was re
duced la. t week, however, when an
exterminator was hired.
If students were displeased over |

the already ■.(til* led food gifts, they
ai e even mote disturber! I>v jammed
po'f nfli'T box combination locks,
postal clerks advise. Daily some
students find their letters impris
oned in a stubbornly locked box
that can be opened only after min
utes of dial twisting.

Distributing ;..ltno l I.O'JO packages
;i day as well as the 10.000 letters,
Hip post office terves both the c mi
pus an I Stanford Village. Pointing
fo annual receipts which exceeded
$1133,000 in 1951, Gray advised that
the campus post office is the largest |
branch of the Palo Alto office. Dur
ing the K>.')l Christmas rush season, !
more than (<l,OOO items rattled
through the campus cancellation
| machine ;.
'I lie ti'C I office bu'ldip" is
f.rin .Stanford and depends on llr*
farm's work force for repair '
'I hougJi postal inspectors have
complained to Slan'otd officials
that the building is "crummy" ami
that improvement steps should I c
taken, the University has stalled
requests, advising that no funds
are availab!? for immediate work.
However, All Brandin, 'jtanford
business manager, reports that plans
are being drawn for i new, ultra
modern po 1 1 office with cotistruc- |
lion due within "several years."
"We recognize the need for a
new post office* and thai a new one
lias been desperately needed for
at least live veai s, but c*arfly
how or when we can construct
I til- building i . not I nowu," Bran
din said.
