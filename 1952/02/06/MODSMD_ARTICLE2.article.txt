## House Committee Drafts Main Points of UMT Bill 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 (UP) â€” I
The Hon e Aimed Services Com- !
mittee agreed today on the main J
points of a bill under which all
qualified 18-year-old youths would l
be called up for .six months of uni- I
versal military training.
The committee will meet tomor- j
row to put finishing touches on the j
bill and to report it formally to the |
House. Members said not more |
than a handful of vote, will be cast
against it.
Except for | rovisions previously
agreed lo by Congress, the commit- J
tee left open the question of how i
and when UMT can be started. De
tense leaders have said they hope
to crank it up on a small scale next \
summer or fall.
The committee, however, ap
proved an amendment by Chairman
Carl Vin on (1)., Ga.) to block the
Defense Department's announced
plans to start the system on a strict- i
ly voluntary basis.
