# Card Gridders Schedule Seven Home Games
## Only Cal, UCLA, WSC Played Away; San Jose Added to Make Total of Ten 
### DICK KLEIN Daily Sports Editor 
The 1362 football schedule lor the Stanlord Indians was dis
j closed late Monday night by the Stanford Athletic Dept. The
schedule was completed when San Jose State was added and
Santa Clara was shifted to the opening date.
Seven of the ten games will be played in the Stanford Stadium,

living the Cards one of the finest
home schedules in the history of the
school. There is one stretch in late
October and November when four
games in a row will be played before
Card rooters on the local turf.
When the Univ. of San Francisco
decided to drop football a while back,
a hole was left in the tentative sched
ule. After San Jose State was con
tacted and was available for the Nov.
1 date, Santa Clara was willing to
drop back to the vacant opening
date—Sept. 20.
Michigan Top Draw
The big intersectional with the
ever-dangerous Wolverines of Mich
igan looms as the top draw on the
seven home events. The Indians play
Michigan in their third game of the
season. The USC Trojans will also
appear in the Stadium this coming
season.
Only games away are the Big
Game in Berkeley, the UCLA game
in Los Angeles, and the Washington
State game up in Pullman. Since
most students and local fans will
travel to the Cal game, it cannot
really be considered a contest on the
road.
According to Don Liebendorfer,
Stanford's Athletic News Director,
"It is one of the very finest home
schedules. It gives students and
local supporters a chance to see seven
games right here and an eighth at
Berkeley. Nine out of ten games
can be seen without any long trips."
Helps Independents
Even though it may not be the
best money-making schedule, it falls
right in line with Stanford's policy
of giving the Bay Area independents
a helping hand. Stanford has done a
full share in trying to build up better
relations with the non-Conference
schools and building up their sched
ules.
In comparison with this past sea
son's schedule, which was definitely
a real traveling one. it should prove
much more to the liking of regular
Card football fans.
