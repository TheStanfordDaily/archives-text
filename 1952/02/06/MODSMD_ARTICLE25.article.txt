# SAB Takes on More Responsibility
## 
### 
The Stanford Athletic Board Saturday faced
squarely the question of approving funds to
send the basketball team to Honolulu for two
games March 21 and 22. The dates conflict
with winter quarter finals, and the board denied
approval ol funds.
further, the SAB appointed three board
members to meet with the Committee on
Schedules and Examinations to work out a
policy to apply where such conflicts as that
involving the basketballers occur.
Regardless of the outcome ol this joint com
mittee meeting, the result will be a strengthen
ing of the SAB's responsibility. While the
Ijoard in the past has tried to take into consider
ation the entire problem—athletic as well as
scholastic, its decisions have been subject to
veto by the Committee on Schedules and Ex
aminations. The veto has been applied infre
quently, but it seems almost entirely unneces
sary if the whole problem is faced in the first
instance by the SAB.
Several SAB members seem to favor a
flexible policy, such as one that would allow
athletes to compete in events during finals or
dead week "when circumstances warrant it."

This phrase includes events considered un
usually important, events where there is con
siderable educational advantage to the travel
involved, and cases where scheduling is out
of Stanford's hands —or a combination of these.
NCAA meets would fall in the "out of our
hands" category.
Whether the policy determined is flexible
or not, the SAB will not be passing the buck.
It will be more cognizant of the views of the
Committee on Schedules and Examinations
when the academic-athletic conflict comes up.
It seems important that there be such focus
ing of responsibility especially now, when criti
cism of college athletics is at an all time high.
And much of the criticism has centered around
just such problems as that involving the basket
ball team, where it might seem sending the
club is over-emphasizing the athletic at the ex
pense of the scholastic side of the picture.
Stanford is fortunate in having an athletic
board capable of tackling the problem at the
beginning. Composed as it is of students,
faculty, and alumni, it certainly has member
ship able to weigh both scholastic and ath
letic considerations in making decisions.

policy to apply where such conflicts as that
involving the basketballers occur.
Regardless of the outcome ol this joint com
mittee meeting, the result will be a strengthen
ing of the SAB's responsibility. While the
Ijoard in the past has tried to take into consider
ation the entire problem—athletic as well as
scholastic, its decisions have been subject to
veto by the Committee on Schedules and Ex
aminations. The veto has been applied infre
quently, but it seems almost entirely unneces
sary if the whole problem is faced in the first
instance by the SAB.
Several SAB members seem to favor a
flexible policy, such as one that would allow
athletes to compete in events during finals or
dead week "when circumstances warrant it."

This phrase includes events considered un
usually important, events where there is con
siderable educational advantage to the travel
involved, and cases where scheduling is out
of Stanford's hands —or a combination of these.
NCAA meets would fall in the "out of our
hands" category.
Whether the policy determined is flexible
or not, the SAB will not be passing the buck.
It will be more cognizant of the views of the
Committee on Schedules and Examinations
when the academic-athletic conflict comes up.
It seems important that there be such focus
ing of responsibility especially now, when criti
cism of college athletics is at an all time high.
And much of the criticism has centered around
just such problems as that involving the basket
ball team, where it might seem sending the
club is over-emphasizing the athletic at the ex
pense of the scholastic side of the picture.
Stanford is fortunate in having an athletic
board capable of tackling the problem at the
beginning. Composed as it is of students,
faculty, and alumni, it certainly has member
ship able to weigh both scholastic and ath
letic considerations in making decisions.
