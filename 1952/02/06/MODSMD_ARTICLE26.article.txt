# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
WEDNESDAY MORNING JOTTINGS
Yosemite's Badger Pass, site of the Stanford Ski
Carnival, was like a subdivision of the Quad last
weekend, 112 bumped into just about everyone \ knew.
Which hurt, since many of the people I bumped into
were coming down the slupes at a fast clip. And
while 1 was filling up sitzmarks, I decided to pass
along the following items:
WARREN G. APPEARS AGAIN. Bandleader Jack
Petty is the latest victim of the Warren G. Wonka

hoax. At the Alnvahnee Hotel's
plush dining room (in Yosemite),
Petty microphoned the following
announcement to the 500 or so
who were munching their ten
course dinners:
"Someone in the Stanford Ski
Club, which is ha\ing its ban
quet here tonight, asked me to
unhounce that it's Warren G.
Wonka's birthday. Now, let's
all put down our knives and

forks and swallow our food and sing happy birthday
to Warren G. Wonka. Ready, go!"
The orchestra strikes up and the assemblage sings
Happy Birthday.
"Thank you, everyone, now will WarreniG. Wonka
stand up, please?"
No one stands. •
"Oh, come now, Warren, don't be shy. (Stand up."
No one stands.
"Come, come now, Warren, stand up and let every
one take a look at you." I
No one stands.
"Well, I guess Warren is a little shy tonight."

The 500 went back to munching their ten-course
dinners.
BRING THE DOGS BACK. A big six and a loco
motive for Dick McLean (rhymes with mean) for his
crusade to bring the dogs back. Having been a mem
ber of the SPCA for seven years. I am in favor of
this. As a famous lawyer once said, "A dog is the
one loyal friend that man has in this selfish world."
NROTC MEN, ATTENTION. The latest campus
joke is about how closely the NROTC uniforms re
semble Greyhound bus drivers' raiments. One in
genious student took advantage of the resemblance
by hopping on a bus at Palo Alto and getting a free
trip to San Francisco. The bus driver thought he was
one of the gang. That boy will make admiral some
day.
CLOSE CALLS DEPT. Herb Stusser, sports editor
of the Quad last year, was driving past Angel 1 Field
last week, suddenly saw a discus shoot at his car,
jammed on the brakes, watched it miss his wind
shield by two inches, drove on.
Jackie Ungemach, freshman from Denver, reports
that she was buried by an avalance while skiing re
cently. She dug her way out in ten minutes; her girl
friend, three yards away, was under six feet of snow
for an hour. Great sport, skiing.
FL1 INKED! A Farm foreign student was driving
with another person in Palo Alto recently and made
the mistake ol hitting the side of a building. The other
person happened to be the driving inspector and the
building happened to be the Dept. of Motor Vehicles.
Rumor has it that the student flunked the driving test.

HEARD AT THE CELLAR DEPT. "The reason
most men prefer beauty to brains is that they can
see better than they can think."

WEDNESDAY MORNING JOTTINGS
Yosemite's Badger Pass, site of the Stanford Ski
Carnival, was like a subdivision of the Quad last
weekend, 112 bumped into just about everyone \ knew.
Which hurt, since many of the people I bumped into
were coming down the slupes at a fast clip. And
while 1 was filling up sitzmarks, I decided to pass
along the following items:
WARREN G. APPEARS AGAIN. Bandleader Jack
Petty is the latest victim of the Warren G. Wonka

hoax. At the Alnvahnee Hotel's
plush dining room (in Yosemite),
Petty microphoned the following
announcement to the 500 or so
who were munching their ten
course dinners:
"Someone in the Stanford Ski
Club, which is ha\ing its ban
quet here tonight, asked me to
unhounce that it's Warren G.
Wonka's birthday. Now, let's
all put down our knives and

forks and swallow our food and sing happy birthday
to Warren G. Wonka. Ready, go!"
The orchestra strikes up and the assemblage sings
Happy Birthday.
"Thank you, everyone, now will WarreniG. Wonka
stand up, please?"
No one stands. •
"Oh, come now, Warren, don't be shy. (Stand up."
No one stands.
"Come, come now, Warren, stand up and let every
one take a look at you." I
No one stands.
"Well, I guess Warren is a little shy tonight."

The 500 went back to munching their ten-course
dinners.
BRING THE DOGS BACK. A big six and a loco
motive for Dick McLean (rhymes with mean) for his
crusade to bring the dogs back. Having been a mem
ber of the SPCA for seven years. I am in favor of
this. As a famous lawyer once said, "A dog is the
one loyal friend that man has in this selfish world."
NROTC MEN, ATTENTION. The latest campus
joke is about how closely the NROTC uniforms re
semble Greyhound bus drivers' raiments. One in
genious student took advantage of the resemblance
by hopping on a bus at Palo Alto and getting a free
trip to San Francisco. The bus driver thought he was
one of the gang. That boy will make admiral some
day.
CLOSE CALLS DEPT. Herb Stusser, sports editor
of the Quad last year, was driving past Angel 1 Field
last week, suddenly saw a discus shoot at his car,
jammed on the brakes, watched it miss his wind
shield by two inches, drove on.
Jackie Ungemach, freshman from Denver, reports
that she was buried by an avalance while skiing re
cently. She dug her way out in ten minutes; her girl
friend, three yards away, was under six feet of snow
for an hour. Great sport, skiing.
FL1 INKED! A Farm foreign student was driving
with another person in Palo Alto recently and made
the mistake ol hitting the side of a building. The other
person happened to be the driving inspector and the
building happened to be the Dept. of Motor Vehicles.
Rumor has it that the student flunked the driving test.
