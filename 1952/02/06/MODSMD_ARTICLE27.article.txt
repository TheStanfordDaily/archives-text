# CAMPUS OPINION
## 'More Women' for Mixer Dances 
### 
Tc the Editor:
Regarding Campus Opinion, February 1, we should
like to second the motion put forward by Paul Chapt
mann, et al., in regard to all-campus mixer dances.
Not only would a function such as this be beneficial
socially to all concerned, but it would also relieve
part of a financial drain suffered by all Stanford men
who date frequently.
A no date mixer dance would probably be very
successful at almost any campus in the country—
except this one. We firmly believe that it would be
UNSUCCESSFUL heie for the following reasons:
1. Women at Stanford are too hard-nosed to take
the chance on being seen anywhere on a week
end night without a date for fear they'll be con
sidered unpopular.
2. In fact, women at Stanford, for the same reason,
sometimes won't accept a date unless it's made
a week or two in advance.
3. Stanford women seem to have the perverted
notion that any guy who gets a date with a Stan
ford girl is probably the luckiest guy alive. This
is probably a result of the 3-1 ratio. It is a
commonly accepted fact that about 50°u of the
most popular Stanford women couldn't get one
date a week-end if they were going to San Jose
or Cal.
Therefore, we should like to put forward another
ruggestion. llow about having a mixer dance every
Friday night and invite San Jose, Mills College and
Cal women Stanford women excluded. Stanford
women may like to restrict themselves to just the
favored fpw, but we males want to expand our hori
zons.
