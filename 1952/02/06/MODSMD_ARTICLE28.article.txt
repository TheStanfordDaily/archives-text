# On Dances, Some Action
## 
### 
To the Editor:
In answer to various inquiries about mixer dances,
I would like to tell everyone about the informal mixier
after the USC basketball game on Friday, Feb. 15, in
the Women's Clubhouse, under the sponsorship of the

Senior Class. There will be refreshments served and
a five piece combo will play from 9:30 until 12:30.
This is the type of event that should be given more
encouragement on the Stanford campus. It is an
inexpensive, easy, convenient way to spend an evening
with or without a date; it also offers an opportunity
to get to know a few more of the students in living
groups other than your own. This is what you have
been asking for, so let's support it.
