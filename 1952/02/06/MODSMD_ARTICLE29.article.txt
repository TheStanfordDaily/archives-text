# Complaint on the RBR
## 
### 
To the Editor:
It seems to us that the Reserve Book Room is due
for a little overhauling with regard to taking out
books overnight. At present the system is a hap
hazard thing at best, full of contradictions and lenien
cies which should not exist if every student is to get
his fair chance at the books.
The supposed hour for taking out reserve books is
8 p.m. We will not quibble over a few minutes earlier
in certain cases, but when books leave the libe for
the evening as early as 7:15 or so it almost means
missing dinner to get the book you want. Further
more, some standard procedure ought to be divised,
or if one is devised, put into effect regarding "holds."
A few nights ago we went to the RBR about 8 to
take out a book overnight. We were told that there
were some 2 hour "holds" on the book and therefore
it could not go out of the building until everyone
there had had a chance to read it. Last night we
went to the Libe at 7:.10 to get a hook for 2 hours.
This time we were told that the book was already
signed out for overnight and that there was no point
in putting a hold on it as it was already done.
Some clarification is due on this point. Either the
library staff or the students should be set straight on
RBR procedure or the whole idea of "reserve books"
is a useless concept.
