## 'Ike for President' Spurs Varied Student Reaction 
### JIM MADISON 
The recent declaration by General Eisenhower that he will run
for President il nominated has prompted much comment in college
newspapers around the country.
The prevailing editorial comment seems to be slightly skeptical
about Ike's Presidential qualifications, but student polls have re-

vealed much enthusiasm for him •
In editorials, opinions have ranged
from doubt that the nation should
have a military President to wheth
er or not Eisenhower's performance
at the helm of Columbia indicated
much aptitude for presidencies in
general.
However, in more than one in
stance the average man on cam
pus has greatly favored Eisenhow
er: both at Fresno State and Uni
versity of Cincinnati, student opin
ion polls favored Ike by large ma
jorities.

Coeds at the University of Michi
gan have taken to copying the peo
ple attached to the UN headquar
ters building in Manhattan by fill
ing their hope chests with silver,
china, and other items donated in
voluntarily by the student dining
halls and various dorms. The pil
fering has reportedly reached over
a thousand dollars per year. Won
der if they have ever heard of the
Fundamental Standard?

A voluntary method of faculty
rating has been instituted by the
University of Texas. Blanks for
rating are distributed to each fac
ulty member on which he may have
his classes rate him if he wishes.
The ratings then are kept by the
individual teachers so that they
can improve their 'methods of
teaching.

They're having trouble with tele
phone vandals back at Dartmouth,
but it isn't with the age-old coin-

spinning racket. Seems that the
Hanovei 1 lads have taken a fancy
to earpieces of their dormitory
phones, and have removed several.
Probation is the punishment threat
ened for apprehended culprits of
this dastardly crime.

If the city of Ann Arbor can
fight its way through a maze of
legal obstacles confronting a pro
posed city tax ordinance, Michigan
students along with other citizens
will have to pay a special 10 per
cent tax on all amusements includ
ing football and other athletic tick
ets, as well as dance bids and the
like.

The newest addition to a long list
of elderly college students to make
newspaper feature headlines is Mrs.
Mercy Bromley, 74, at Oregon. Mrs.
Bromley is enrolled in—of all things
—a course in prospecting; and seems
to delight in learning to pan lor gold
with the rest of the class, all men.

And last but not least comes an
idea that might pep up a few eight
o'clocks around hpre. Dartmouth
has initiated a new av/ard to fac
ulty members "who have made no
table contributions to the improve
ment of undergraduate instruction."
Like hosting lectures at Donner
Summit, maybe?
