## The 						Sporting Line 
### 
The Daily carried a short item the other day that listed several points
taken up by the Stanford Athletic Board at a recent meeting. Action by
the Hoard is usually very important to the whole Farm sports picture,
t.nd this was especially true of the latest one. Several points could use
a little explanation.
First off, the ancient, hut ever-present budget problems are still a
big consideration. Because Michigan hasn't sent in reports of our share
of tlie Ann Arbor receipts and because the Rose Bowl split isn't set yet,
the total Athletic Department revenue cannot be figured. And any econ
major will tell you that without* total income lixed, no budget can be set
up. Tilings are that much up in the air.
Then along come three teams requesting additional funds for big,
expensive trips. The rugby team was turned down in their efforts to pet
money for a trip up to Canada to play British Columbia. Why? Not enough
money? Yes, that's part of the refusal. Another angle is this. What little
is held in reserve for special trips is given to teams that can make the best
showing and will be the most representative of Stanford athletics and of
Stanford as a university. All the potential of the ruggers is still on paper.
And the game would not earn the winner a national ranking or mythical
championship. Further, rugby cannot be considered as important a sport
as others on the athletic schedule.
CREW—UNDECIDED NOW
The SAB deferred action on the crew which asked for $2,000 for a trip
back Fast and the Olympic tryouts. The very difficult and touchy crew
problem was left "hanging fire." It was hard for the Board, which consists
of representatives from faculty, alumni, and students, to give the strokers
an absolute and flat denial. But there are just insufficient funds in the
SAB bankbook.
The crew situation is especially aggravated and exaggerated because
tlie rowers have been trying for several years to get merely a basic ex
pensive figure to help litem along. But no soap. And the boys put in
many long, hard hours into their sport and have been doing quite well at
it, too. And as a result of their tremendous efforts, have gained hits of
line publicity for Stanford throughout the East, etc.
On the good side of the ledger—the red-hot swim team will be able
to compete in the national meet. Held back in Kazamier-land on Ivy
League's cherished ground, the NCAA's will give the Card swimmers a
chance to crack into the national sportslight on the Princeton campus.
Coach Haynie's charges are solid contenders and should end up no worse
than fourth and maybe third in the nationals.
A STANFORD MOVIE REVIEW
A publicity movie was turned down. This was a general film on Stan
ford with very little on athletics. And that's why it wasn't too interesting
to SAB members. It was done by a private individual, a grad student here
on campus, on a purely speculative basis. The thing just didn't pan out
for him.
The value of such a movie—properly done—has long been recognized
by the Athletic Dept. The whole discussion has always been based on
this premise: If done at all, the movie must be very well done. Other
wise it is better to leave it alone. A professional job is very, very expen
sive, and for proper distribution several copies would be needed. All
this adds up to a lot of moolah. And once again, the tight budget puts the
damper on the project.
As far as subject matter of the film is concerned, almost everybody is
unanimously agreed. It has to be a good cross-section of Stanford. It
must not be all athletics, or just all academics. The best parts of the
physical plant should be shown to the best advantage—the Stadium, Hoover
Libe, Cubberley, Stern Hall, liake Lag, etc. Such a wide coverage will
have the greatest appeal. By hitting upon all phases of Farm life, more
prospective frosh are bound to be enticed.
Another big problem that was discussed deals with the athletic-aca
demic conflict. The SAB took a step in an effort to answer the perrenial
question of—Can and/or should athletics be allowed to cut into regular aca
demic schedules such as dead week and finals? The Varsity basketball
squad was denied funds for a trip to Honolulu for games March 21 and 22.
This is finals week.
For the first time, the SAB faced the academic conflict problem square
ly. The Committee on Schedules and Examinations has had a veto power
when it considered SAB decisions inconsistent with academic policy.
To me, (his is a god sign. It means that Stanford still places academics
and athletics in proper perspective. It means that athletics have not
gotten out of hand on the Farm, and sets up a good example for the many
critics of amateur athletics who moan of commercialism and flagrant
violations by the Universities.

taken up by the Stanford Athletic Board at a recent meeting. Action by
the Hoard is usually very important to the whole Farm sports picture,
t.nd this was especially true of the latest one. Several points could use
a little explanation.
First off, the ancient, hut ever-present budget problems are still a
big consideration. Because Michigan hasn't sent in reports of our share
of tlie Ann Arbor receipts and because the Rose Bowl split isn't set yet,
the total Athletic Department revenue cannot be figured. And any econ
major will tell you that without* total income lixed, no budget can be set
up. Tilings are that much up in the air.
Then along come three teams requesting additional funds for big,
expensive trips. The rugby team was turned down in their efforts to pet
money for a trip up to Canada to play British Columbia. Why? Not enough
money? Yes, that's part of the refusal. Another angle is this. What little
is held in reserve for special trips is given to teams that can make the best
showing and will be the most representative of Stanford athletics and of
Stanford as a university. All the potential of the ruggers is still on paper.
And the game would not earn the winner a national ranking or mythical
championship. Further, rugby cannot be considered as important a sport
as others on the athletic schedule.
CREW—UNDECIDED NOW
The SAB deferred action on the crew which asked for $2,000 for a trip
back Fast and the Olympic tryouts. The very difficult and touchy crew
problem was left "hanging fire." It was hard for the Board, which consists
of representatives from faculty, alumni, and students, to give the strokers
an absolute and flat denial. But there are just insufficient funds in the
SAB bankbook.
The crew situation is especially aggravated and exaggerated because
tlie rowers have been trying for several years to get merely a basic ex
pensive figure to help litem along. But no soap. And the boys put in
many long, hard hours into their sport and have been doing quite well at
it, too. And as a result of their tremendous efforts, have gained hits of
line publicity for Stanford throughout the East, etc.
On the good side of the ledger—the red-hot swim team will be able
to compete in the national meet. Held back in Kazamier-land on Ivy
League's cherished ground, the NCAA's will give the Card swimmers a
chance to crack into the national sportslight on the Princeton campus.
Coach Haynie's charges are solid contenders and should end up no worse
than fourth and maybe third in the nationals.
A STANFORD MOVIE REVIEW
A publicity movie was turned down. This was a general film on Stan
ford with very little on athletics. And that's why it wasn't too interesting
to SAB members. It was done by a private individual, a grad student here
on campus, on a purely speculative basis. The thing just didn't pan out
for him.
The value of such a movie—properly done—has long been recognized
by the Athletic Dept. The whole discussion has always been based on
this premise: If done at all, the movie must be very well done. Other
wise it is better to leave it alone. A professional job is very, very expen
sive, and for proper distribution several copies would be needed. All
this adds up to a lot of moolah. And once again, the tight budget puts the
damper on the project.
As far as subject matter of the film is concerned, almost everybody is
unanimously agreed. It has to be a good cross-section of Stanford. It
must not be all athletics, or just all academics. The best parts of the
physical plant should be shown to the best advantage—the Stadium, Hoover
Libe, Cubberley, Stern Hall, liake Lag, etc. Such a wide coverage will
have the greatest appeal. By hitting upon all phases of Farm life, more
prospective frosh are bound to be enticed.
Another big problem that was discussed deals with the athletic-aca
demic conflict. The SAB took a step in an effort to answer the perrenial
question of—Can and/or should athletics be allowed to cut into regular aca
demic schedules such as dead week and finals? The Varsity basketball
squad was denied funds for a trip to Honolulu for games March 21 and 22.
This is finals week.
For the first time, the SAB faced the academic conflict problem square
ly. The Committee on Schedules and Examinations has had a veto power
when it considered SAB decisions inconsistent with academic policy.
To me, (his is a god sign. It means that Stanford still places academics
and athletics in proper perspective. It means that athletics have not
gotten out of hand on the Farm, and sets up a good example for the many
critics of amateur athletics who moan of commercialism and flagrant
violations by the Universities.

the Hoard is usually very important to the whole Farm sports picture,
t.nd this was especially true of the latest one. Several points could use
a little explanation.
First off, the ancient, hut ever-present budget problems are still a
big consideration. Because Michigan hasn't sent in reports of our share
of tlie Ann Arbor receipts and because the Rose Bowl split isn't set yet,
the total Athletic Department revenue cannot be figured. And any econ
major will tell you that without* total income lixed, no budget can be set
up. Tilings are that much up in the air.
Then along come three teams requesting additional funds for big,
expensive trips. The rugby team was turned down in their efforts to pet
money for a trip up to Canada to play British Columbia. Why? Not enough
money? Yes, that's part of the refusal. Another angle is this. What little
is held in reserve for special trips is given to teams that can make the best
showing and will be the most representative of Stanford athletics and of
Stanford as a university. All the potential of the ruggers is still on paper.
And the game would not earn the winner a national ranking or mythical
championship. Further, rugby cannot be considered as important a sport
as others on the athletic schedule.
CREW—UNDECIDED NOW
The SAB deferred action on the crew which asked for $2,000 for a trip
back Fast and the Olympic tryouts. The very difficult and touchy crew
problem was left "hanging fire." It was hard for the Board, which consists
of representatives from faculty, alumni, and students, to give the strokers
an absolute and flat denial. But there are just insufficient funds in the
SAB bankbook.
The crew situation is especially aggravated and exaggerated because
tlie rowers have been trying for several years to get merely a basic ex
pensive figure to help litem along. But no soap. And the boys put in
many long, hard hours into their sport and have been doing quite well at
it, too. And as a result of their tremendous efforts, have gained hits of
line publicity for Stanford throughout the East, etc.
On the good side of the ledger—the red-hot swim team will be able
to compete in the national meet. Held back in Kazamier-land on Ivy
League's cherished ground, the NCAA's will give the Card swimmers a
chance to crack into the national sportslight on the Princeton campus.
Coach Haynie's charges are solid contenders and should end up no worse
than fourth and maybe third in the nationals.
A STANFORD MOVIE REVIEW
A publicity movie was turned down. This was a general film on Stan
ford with very little on athletics. And that's why it wasn't too interesting
to SAB members. It was done by a private individual, a grad student here
on campus, on a purely speculative basis. The thing just didn't pan out
for him.
The value of such a movie—properly done—has long been recognized
by the Athletic Dept. The whole discussion has always been based on
this premise: If done at all, the movie must be very well done. Other
wise it is better to leave it alone. A professional job is very, very expen
sive, and for proper distribution several copies would be needed. All
this adds up to a lot of moolah. And once again, the tight budget puts the
damper on the project.
As far as subject matter of the film is concerned, almost everybody is
unanimously agreed. It has to be a good cross-section of Stanford. It
must not be all athletics, or just all academics. The best parts of the
physical plant should be shown to the best advantage—the Stadium, Hoover
Libe, Cubberley, Stern Hall, liake Lag, etc. Such a wide coverage will
have the greatest appeal. By hitting upon all phases of Farm life, more
prospective frosh are bound to be enticed.
Another big problem that was discussed deals with the athletic-aca
demic conflict. The SAB took a step in an effort to answer the perrenial
question of—Can and/or should athletics be allowed to cut into regular aca
demic schedules such as dead week and finals? The Varsity basketball
squad was denied funds for a trip to Honolulu for games March 21 and 22.
This is finals week.
For the first time, the SAB faced the academic conflict problem square
ly. The Committee on Schedules and Examinations has had a veto power
when it considered SAB decisions inconsistent with academic policy.
To me, (his is a god sign. It means that Stanford still places academics
and athletics in proper perspective. It means that athletics have not
gotten out of hand on the Farm, and sets up a good example for the many
critics of amateur athletics who moan of commercialism and flagrant
violations by the Universities.
