Sigma Chi II, sparked by forward

last-minute burst, 38-32, in an early
mural game played last night in the
Pavilion.
Sigma Chi got off to a quick start,
piling up a six-point lead early in
the game. With the score 16 to 14
in the waning minutes of the first
half, Norris intercepted a Delt pass
under his own basket for two points
and immediately added two quick
luyups to give the Sigma Chi's a
22-14 half-time bulge.
Early in the third quarter, three
straight buckets by Dick Andrews,
Bob Redford, and center Puss La-
Telle brought the Delts to within
four points of the winners, 24-20,
but the Sigma Chi's bounced back
with a free throw by Norris, a jump
shot by Dick Evleth, and another
driving layup by Norris to widen
the gap to nine points, 31-22.
Early in the fourth quarter, with
the score 32 to 22 in favor of the
Sigma Chi's, the Delts put on their
last rally. Chic Schmidt hit a side
shot from about 15 feet out and al
most immediately countered with a
one-handed push shot from 20 feet

out to make it 32-2G.
Then Phil Hicks, coach of the
team, hit a jump shot from the side,
Schmidt dropped in a free throw,
and Hicks potted a one - handed
push shot to bring the Delts to
within one point of the leaders, 32-
31.
Champion then broke through the
Delt zone for a layup to make it
34-31 and Norris cinched it with a
pair of jump shots good for four
more points to make the final score
38-32.
Norris was high point man in the
game with 20. Champion was sec
ond with 10. Hicks and Schmidt
were tied for high point honors
with eight points apiece.
The Sigma Chi's held complete
control of both backboards through
out the game, and took off almost
all the offensive rebounds. The Delt
defense couldn't keep the Sigma
Chi's from beneath their own bas
ket, while most of their own shots
weer from far out. It was only
sharpshooting and ball handling
that kept the Delts in the ball game.

last-minute burst, 38-32, in an early
mural game played last night in the
Pavilion.
Sigma Chi got off to a quick start,
piling up a six-point lead early in
the game. With the score 16 to 14
in the waning minutes of the first
half, Norris intercepted a Delt pass
under his own basket for two points
and immediately added two quick
luyups to give the Sigma Chi's a
22-14 half-time bulge.
Early in the third quarter, three
straight buckets by Dick Andrews,
Bob Redford, and center Puss La-
Telle brought the Delts to within
four points of the winners, 24-20,
but the Sigma Chi's bounced back
with a free throw by Norris, a jump
shot by Dick Evleth, and another
driving layup by Norris to widen
the gap to nine points, 31-22.
Early in the fourth quarter, with
the score 32 to 22 in favor of the
Sigma Chi's, the Delts put on their
last rally. Chic Schmidt hit a side
shot from about 15 feet out and al
most immediately countered with a
one-handed push shot from 20 feet

out to make it 32-2G.
Then Phil Hicks, coach of the
team, hit a jump shot from the side,
Schmidt dropped in a free throw,
and Hicks potted a one - handed
push shot to bring the Delts to
within one point of the leaders, 32-
31.
Champion then broke through the
Delt zone for a layup to make it
34-31 and Norris cinched it with a
pair of jump shots good for four
more points to make the final score
38-32.
Norris was high point man in the
game with 20. Champion was sec
ond with 10. Hicks and Schmidt
were tied for high point honors
with eight points apiece.
The Sigma Chi's held complete
control of both backboards through
out the game, and took off almost
all the offensive rebounds. The Delt
defense couldn't keep the Sigma
Chi's from beneath their own bas
ket, while most of their own shots
weer from far out. It was only
sharpshooting and ball handling
that kept the Delts in the ball game.
