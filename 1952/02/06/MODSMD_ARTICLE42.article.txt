# Hoopsters Prep for Rugged Saint Mary's and Santa Clara
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
Stanford's cagers will take stiff
v/orkouts today and tomorrow to
prep for this weekend's tough,
rough tilts with St. Mary's and
Santa Clara.
The Gaels and Broncos are the
two best local independent teams.
One of tliem is almost certain to
represent the Bay Area in the
forthcoming Independent Tourney
in Corvallis, Oregon.
Coach Bob Burnett's problem is
a happy one. He is not trying tc
find a winning combination, but
just to maintain one. The two-pla
toon system will remain. This con
sists of starting Ed Tucker, Jim
Ramstead, Olie Suzdaleff, Bon
Tomsic, and Jim Walsh, and having
them play their usual run-and
shoot style of basketball. When the
first string tires, however, Burnett
inserts a second team of Don De-
Long, Gary Andrews, Paul Johnson.
Bruce Iversen, and George Zanino
vich. These boys slow down the
tempo of play and give the first
stringers time to catch their col
lective breath. This second team
was able to outscore the fast-break
ing San Jose Spartans and hold the
great Phillips Oilers on practically
even terms. Johnson and DeLong
are fair floor men, but great shots.
Andrews and Iversen are vice versa,
and jumping George Zaninovich
gives this quintet a little more
background control. Together they
form a good team.
Stanford's more conservative
jamming man-to-man defense will

also remain. The hectic full presses
of the past have been discarded.
Friday's 7:45 tilt with St. Mary's
in the Cow Palace will be rough.
St. Mary's has a big height ad
vantage over the Cards and in
C-ft. 8-in. Ben Gibson they have
an awkward but still potent scor
ing threat. Santa Cla.a is also
much taller than the Cards.
