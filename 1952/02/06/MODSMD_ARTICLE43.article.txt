# Ruggers to Meet Petaluma Saturday in Season Opener
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
With two weeks of practice al
ready under their belts, Stanford's
rugby team will open the season
Saturday against the Petaluma Leg
horns.
Coach Pete Kmetovic will be try
ing for the Pacilic Coast crown
again this year. The Cards had to
settle for a tie with Cal for the
title last season, but they were un
disputed kingpins of the Coast in
1950.
So far a tentative first team has
been drawn up that includes
Norm Manooi'ian. Dick Borda,
and Howard Standifer in the front
rank; Len Mayrhafer and Len
Kaprielian in the second rank;
Ron Eadie and Sam Morley at the
breakaway spots; Jesse Cone at
lock; liar y Snell at scrum half;
Wes Laub cher at first five; Ron
Cook at second live; Jim Stewart
at three-quarters; Bill McMahon
and Derek Leichty at the kings;
an < Bol) Garrett at fullback.
A 1 Kirkland, out with a cold, v/ill
be expected to fill in at a first
rauk position when he returns. He
started last season and was a prime
factor in the Cards' outstanding
record.
The mo c ;t experienced members of
the starting team are I'odtballers
Norm Manoogian and Jesse Cone,
each having played rugby for two
years. Manoogian weighs in at l'J7,
and Cone. 204.
Len Kaprielian, 255, and St.
Mary's transfer Len Mayrhofer
form an impressive second rank. In
eligible for football this year, Mayr
hofer will help bolster the gridders
next season along with his rugby
chores. Len is one of the men most
responsible for St. Mary's fine
showing against Georgia in 1950
when the four-touchdown under
dog Gaels tied Wally Butts' crew,
7-7.
A pair of ends on the 1951 Hose
Bowl team, Ron Eadie and Sam
Morley, lill in at the breakaway
posts. Eadie played rugby last year
for the Cards but Morley has had
no experience.
Other men who will see plenty of
action in the line are Bernie To

karz, breakaway; A 1 Manner and
Harry Hunt .second rank; and John
Broderick and Jim Vick, front
rankers.
Harry Snell, who hails from
South Africa; Ron Cook, first string
last year; and Bill McMahon form
the nucleus of a very good back-

field. Snell fills in at scrum half,
a position comparable to the quar
terback in American football.
McMahon, a transfer from Menlo
JC and originally from Canada,
makes good use of his experience,
speed, and aggressiveness.
