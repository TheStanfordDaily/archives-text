The commission, appointed by
Governor Warren in April, 1951, in
cludes representatives of manufac
turing, finance, research, distribu
tion, and labor from all parts of
California. Its objectives are to
promote the welfare of small busi
ness during the emergency period
and to assist the defense program
by promoting full utilization of
small plant capacity.
The first such unit to be formed,
the California commission has
served as a model for similar groups
in many other states. It has spon
sored sub-contracting clinics, rec
ommended changes in regulations
and legislation, has effected changes
in procurement policies, has aided
in the preparation and distribution
of informative literature to small
business, and has helped co-ordi
nate activities of governmental, ed
ucational, and private groups.
