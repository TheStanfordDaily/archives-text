# New Divorce Law Before Congress
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 (UP)
The Senate Judiciary CommitUo
approved legislation today which
would guarantee that a valid di
vorce granted in one state would be
legal in any other state provided
certain minimum .standards were
met.
The bill would not automatically
legalize in all states so-called
"quickie" divorces granted in Ne
vada, Florida, and some other states
becau e they do nut meet one of
the tests.
The measure, sponsored by Chair
man Pat McCarran (D., Nov.),
would require that the stale grant
ing the decree be the he tin which
the couple lived as man and wife
or that the defendant be subject to
the state's jurisdiction or appear at
the proceedings.
This would eliminate many <>112 the
Nevada and Florida divorces :.ince
they grant divorces after only one
spou::e establishes legal residence.
