# 'Musical Bats' Play Mystery Bell Concert
## 
### 
Hooker Tower's cat illon was played
j mysteriously fur the second time at
' about 2 a.m. yesterday morning.
Campus police were m I lie vicinity
at the time and investigated immedi
ately, but the search revealed noth
ing.
The Sunday morning serenade be- |
| tween 4 and (i a.m. was the first oc
currence of the musical bats in the [
j belfry.
Three residents of Stern Hall were
awakened by the bells. 1 hey as
i serted that three tunes were played
i "expertly . . . without a mistake,"
and one has been identified as "Mary
Had a Little Lamb."
The carillon is played from a key
board on the thirteenth floor con- j
! sisting of pegs several inches long j
and foot pedals. The whole appara- ]
tus is locked and a board is placed
across the pegs and padlocked at j
night. The police stated that carillon
was properly locked when they ar
rived. Unless the "bats" had keys,
l the bells could only be played by j
i manipulating the wires.
Police, baffled by the nocturnal I
entry of the bell players, claim all j
entrances to the building are locked |
each night.
