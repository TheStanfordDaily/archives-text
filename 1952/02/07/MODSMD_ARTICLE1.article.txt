### 
WASHINGTON, Felt, (i (UP) â€”
The Hon .e Armed Services Com
mittee formally approved a "bona
fide" Universal Military Training
bill today under which all able
bodied 18-year-olds would be called
up for :ix months' training. The
vote was 27 to 7.
The committee left open the
que. lion of how and when UMT
should start. But Rep. James E. Van
Zandt (R., Ph.}, a long-time sup
porter of UMT, and other members
indicated they will support on the
House floor an amendment to delay
the tr.lining program until the draft
is halted.
Committee Chairman Carl Vinson
(D., Ga.) said the bill will be called
up in the House the last week of
this month. He predicted it will be
passed. Opponents, led by Rep.
Dewey Short (I?., Mo.), were equal
ly confident they could defeat it.
