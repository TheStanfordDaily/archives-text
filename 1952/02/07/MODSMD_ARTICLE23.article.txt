### 
LONDON, Keb. fi (UP) — King
George VI, a frail, quiet man who
never wanted the throne, chcd
quietly today in his sleep.
It was a price the ailing King had
known lie might have to pay for
shunning the wheelchair his physi
ians recommended and continuing
to shoulder the cares and duties o£
government.
To 50,000,000 Britons and 500,000,-
000 subjets throughout the British
Commonwealth of Nations, hh
death came as a profound shock. It
had been assumed he was recover
ing satisfactorily from a drast'.n
operation last Sept. 23 for removal
of a diseased lung.
Tonight silent crowd, many weep
ing openly, huddled in the rain in
front of Buckingham Palace and of
James Palace, mourning their lost
monarch and waiting to hear an of
ficial proclamation naming Elizabeth
their Queen.
By tradition, the brief bulletin
from Sandringham House, in Nor
folk, telling the King's subjects their
beloved monarch was dead, made
no mention of the cause of death.
But medical men, familiar with
(he history of the illnesses which
had plagued the 56-year-old sov
ereign, believed he died of a blood
clot resulting from an arterial on
striction in his legs from which he
had suffered since 1948.
The King, chafing at enforced in
activity, refused to adhere to the
slow, steady walking pace suggested
by his doctors. He surprised his
subjects with the nimbleness with
which he mounted the steps of the
plane that took Elizabeth and her
husband, Philip, Duke of Edin
burgh, to Africa on Jan. 31. He
kept his schedule of appointments
and insisted on going shooting on
the Norfolk moors. Only yerterday
lie spent the day at the shooting
stands.
He retired last night in good spl -
its and in his normal health.
He was dead when his valet came
to waken him this morning.
"He knew what he was doing," a
medical source commented. "It was
a calculated risk—and he lost."

To 50,000,000 Britons and 500,000,-
000 subjets throughout the British
Commonwealth of Nations, hh
death came as a profound shock. It
had been assumed he was recover
ing satisfactorily from a drast'.n
operation last Sept. 23 for removal
of a diseased lung.
Tonight silent crowd, many weep
ing openly, huddled in the rain in
front of Buckingham Palace and of
James Palace, mourning their lost
monarch and waiting to hear an of
ficial proclamation naming Elizabeth
their Queen.
By tradition, the brief bulletin
from Sandringham House, in Nor
folk, telling the King's subjects their
beloved monarch was dead, made
no mention of the cause of death.
But medical men, familiar with
(he history of the illnesses which
had plagued the 56-year-old sov
ereign, believed he died of a blood
clot resulting from an arterial on
striction in his legs from which he
had suffered since 1948.
The King, chafing at enforced in
activity, refused to adhere to the
slow, steady walking pace suggested
by his doctors. He surprised his
subjects with the nimbleness with
which he mounted the steps of the
plane that took Elizabeth and her
husband, Philip, Duke of Edin
burgh, to Africa on Jan. 31. He
kept his schedule of appointments
and insisted on going shooting on
the Norfolk moors. Only yerterday
lie spent the day at the shooting
stands.
He retired last night in good spl -
its and in his normal health.
He was dead when his valet came
to waken him this morning.
"He knew what he was doing," a
medical source commented. "It was
a calculated risk—and he lost."
