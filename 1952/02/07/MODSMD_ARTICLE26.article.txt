# The 						Foreign Scholars and You

### 
Last week the Foreign Scholarship Committee
sent out letters to all living group presidents on
campus asking their support tor next year's
foreign scholarship program.
In considering whether or not to house a
foreign student next year, the living-groups
should evaluate the iar-reachinq benefits of
this program.
By housing foreign scholars in campus living
groups, Stantord students have the opportunity
to know, hrst hand, students from all parts of the
world.
Having foreign scholars at Stanford is not
only educational, but jt is also a direct step
toward world understanding. The foreign stu
dents who are brought to Stanford return to
their respective countries with a better idea of
what Americans are like, and we, in return, are
better able to understand their way of hfe after
this direct contact.
Next year the foreign Scholarship Committee
is planning to bring seven students to Stanford,
who will be selected by the living groups in
early March.
Living groups have the last word on select
ing foreign students, since they will be con
tributing the room and board ol the scholar
they choose to house. But in a deeper sense,
the choice is up to the individual living
groups because it is upon them that the suc
cess and continuance ol the program rests.
After the success of this yeai's program and
programs in the past, the support of the living

groups should be just as great, if not greater
lor the 'iifi ASSU foreign scholars.
