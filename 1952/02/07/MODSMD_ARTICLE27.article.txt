# Jamboree 'Spirit'
## 
### 
The incident of eight freshmen breaking into
KZSU Tuesday night, and taking over the mike
to hurl a few choice invectives at the class of
'54 is a good example of "spirit" beyond the
bounds of good sense in this spirit-high frosh
soph jamboree week.
Fortunately, the program interrupted by the
over-zealous frosh was not sponsored. Had it
been, KZSU might have had some explaining
to do, and would have faced loss ol the sponsor.
To the station, that's no joke.
Class presidents Fred Aurel, '55, and Don
I.ozabnik, '54, have signed a "non-aggression"
pact for the week in an attempt to keep this
sort of conduct down. Right now, it doesn't
seem to be doing the trick.-
The freshmen and sophomore classes can
have a lot oi fun with the week's activities.
But if fun is to include personal injury or
property damage, the administration can put
a permanent damper on the jamboree.
Perhaps such action seems too remote to
consider seriously. The sophomore class can
remember, however, what almost happened to
the pajamarino. If this year's jamboree gets
way out of hand, the administration's action
might go just one step beyond "alrnor.t."
