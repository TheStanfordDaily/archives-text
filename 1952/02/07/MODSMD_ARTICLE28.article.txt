ADVICE TO TUP LOVELORN
Love is like an onion,
You taste it with delight.
Anil when it's gone, you wonder,
What ever made you bite.
â€”Dorothy Thompson
Below are a few of the letter': thai I have received
asking for advice. Most of these letters concern prob
lems of love and boy-girl relationships which ex
plains the title for this column. This morning I shall
endeavor to give a bit of guidance to thore in need.
Who knows? Their problem, may lie your own.

Dear Mr. McLean:
I m really a bit. confused. I don't understand the
Stanford boys. Back home in Eureka the fellows and
girls used to go out together for comr

laughs, and a general good time.
No one had dates, we just all run
around together.
But here on the "Farm" it's
different. The boys seem so
strange kind of quiet and wait
ing. Frankly, it unnerves me.
Ono feels as if one is iri a room
with a tiger or something.
Whenever 1 go out, 1 always
insist that we go double date.
Even at that 112 sit by the door in

case I should have to jump or anything. (One never
seems to know.) 1 don't smoke, nor drink, noi dance
in rlose proximity. They all seem so unsanitary. I
always insist that my date get me in before 11:30.
(At big parties, maybe 12:00, but not. a second later.)
I nevei listen to last stories nor at jokes with
double meanings. Or if I laugh, I laugh only at the
dean meaning.
I have had a goodly number of d..tes but usually
the boys only ask me out once. Mother says it's
good and normal to get to know a va) iety of different
people. But they all seem to be the same.
Can you, Mr. M< f;ean, a man t,l ihe world, offer
any solution to my dilemma?

My Dear Miss J Z.:
In leality your problem is solving itself. You're
doing fine. Why, in no time at alt there will be no
difficulty whatsoever. You'll have lots of time for
study. There'll he no noisy interruptions of your
buzzer or phone. You'll have no worries from the
Stanford men. Think how fine it will he to really
get to know all the girls in the corridor. Keep up
the fine work.

Dear Dick: *
My problem is that I don't understand my girl. Slip
is a nice girl and we get along fine but I just can't,
seem to figure her out. When we go out even for
coffee, she always takes a 2:30. If I try to get. her in
early so that. I can get home to study, she says, "Let's
have just one cigarette." 1 try to get away but she
just won't let me. I'm an engineering major and I've
got a lot to do.
She seems to be very fond of me. She always sits
close to me when we drive. In the library she always
holds my hand under the table. (I appreciate her
affection but it makes writing a bit diHicult.) She is
near sighted and I usually have to help her find books
in the stacks.
She wears the latest style, but sometimes with the
new plunging neckline it's a bit embarrassing. (I'm
six foot five.) When we go to the beach, she wears
tliose new bathing suits from Italy or somewhere.
I'm sure she comes from a good home but I don't think
my mother would do those things. Do you?
She keeps me out so late and I have so much study
ing to do that I'm afraid that I'll ruin my health.
Can you offer any solution?
MR. W.W.

Dear Mr. W W.:
Your problem is a health problem indeed. Fat
more green vegetables, more red meat, more shell
foods, more eggs, and stop taking those long walks
in the evening.
