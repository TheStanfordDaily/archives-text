Dear Committee:
School is going forward at a fast rate now, and so
perhaps it's the time to give more details. In some
ways I envy acquaintances going to the Sorbonne;
they rarely go to classes or do work. However,
they're quite bored with the whole deal, Sciences Po,
on the other hand, has a fairly well established regime
of classes and study.
Most courses are only taught once a week; 1 have
about seven hours of classes. The amount of home
work is limitless, though, as the professors just give
bibliographies and expect you to go ahead on your
own. Some go so far as to indicate special readings,
but thin has been the exception more than the rule.
So the Letter part oi the scholastic day is spent in
the Libe, pouring over books.
Hie Libe itself is quite a problem in many re
spects. It's much too small fur the iiumhei ol stu
dents, so theie is a frantic dash to get there between
nine and ten in the morning, stake out a place to
drop one's books, and that is marked and saved for
the day. People go off for several hours, return, and
expert to find their places free. Some rather un
pleasant arguments have occurred when '.aid places

were not free.
Every hour, between classes, there is a bustling
noise and a sudden tumult as tlie crowds pour into
the [.ibe to study before the next class. This is all
complicated by the fact that the Li be is open from
nine till nine, and no books can be taken out.
IVTy most profitable time is the weekend (starting,
for me, at Friday noon!). All work is dropped, and
my time is spent in running to the four corners of
Paris. Last weekend was very rewarding, but some
what of a trial; I went to two museums.
On Friday afternoon I explored another corner
of the gigantic Louvre; Saturday I went to an ev
hihiliun of French impressionist painters. Oddly
enough, the canvasses were borrowed from German
museums. There were only seventy some paintings;
many were superb, particularly good collections of
Van Gogh, Gauguin, Sisley, and Monet. I finally
met up with the very famous Van Gogh of (lie bowl
of sunflowers; it's from a German museum, and here
till the r .i\tli of January!
One of the most interesting features of the exhibit
was the crowds. I've never been so bruised or battered
in my life, football games not excepted. It was a
blessing to he tall; by standing on tiptoes 1 could get
distant glimpses of the paintings, over the sea of
heads. A sharp-pointed umbrella would have been a
good thing to have along for crowd-clearing!

bibliographies and expect you to go ahead on your
own. Some go so far as to indicate special readings,
but thin has been the exception more than the rule.
So the Letter part oi the scholastic day is spent in
the Libe, pouring over books.
Hie Libe itself is quite a problem in many re
spects. It's much too small fur the iiumhei ol stu
dents, so theie is a frantic dash to get there between
nine and ten in the morning, stake out a place to
drop one's books, and that is marked and saved for
the day. People go off for several hours, return, and
expert to find their places free. Some rather un
pleasant arguments have occurred when '.aid places

were not free.
Every hour, between classes, there is a bustling
noise and a sudden tumult as tlie crowds pour into
the [.ibe to study before the next class. This is all
complicated by the fact that the Li be is open from
nine till nine, and no books can be taken out.
IVTy most profitable time is the weekend (starting,
for me, at Friday noon!). All work is dropped, and
my time is spent in running to the four corners of
Paris. Last weekend was very rewarding, but some
what of a trial; I went to two museums.
On Friday afternoon I explored another corner
of the gigantic Louvre; Saturday I went to an ev
hihiliun of French impressionist painters. Oddly
enough, the canvasses were borrowed from German
museums. There were only seventy some paintings;
many were superb, particularly good collections of
Van Gogh, Gauguin, Sisley, and Monet. I finally
met up with the very famous Van Gogh of (lie bowl
of sunflowers; it's from a German museum, and here
till the r .i\tli of January!
One of the most interesting features of the exhibit
was the crowds. I've never been so bruised or battered
in my life, football games not excepted. It was a
blessing to he tall; by standing on tiptoes 1 could get
distant glimpses of the paintings, over the sea of
heads. A sharp-pointed umbrella would have been a
good thing to have along for crowd-clearing!

Dear Committee:
School is going forward at a fast rate now, and so
perhaps it's the time to give more details. In some
ways I envy acquaintances going to the Sorbonne;
they rarely go to classes or do work. However,
they're quite bored with the whole deal, Sciences Po,
on the other hand, has a fairly well established regime
of classes and study.
Most courses are only taught once a week; 1 have
about seven hours of classes. The amount of home
work is limitless, though, as the professors just give
bibliographies and expect you to go ahead on your
own. Some go so far as to indicate special readings,
but thin has been the exception more than the rule.
