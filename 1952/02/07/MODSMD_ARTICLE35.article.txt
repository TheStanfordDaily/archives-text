After seeing the Phillips Oilers-Stanford game, we feel that Stanford will
win the PCC Southern Division.
The fight and drive the varsity showed last Saturday enabled them to
turn in one ol the finest Stanford performances ever seen on the Pavilion
floor. We realize that it isn't every night a team gets the opportunity tc
knock off the Oilers. But if Stanford can only generate the fight and de
termination in their six remaining conference games that they did last week,
future foes had better watch out. This Stanford team is one of the best we
have seen when it is playing the game to the hilt.
By way of not, two of Stanford's three upcoming conference foes, USC
and California, have had games in the Hawaiian Islands. The teams that
they met did not provide the competition that improves a term one bit.
Stanford, one the other hand, met the Stewarts and the Oilers, two of the
nation's toughest teams. It should make a lot of difference when the Con
ference race resumes in ten days.
On Friday and Saturday nights of this week, Stanford plays in the Cow
Palace. St. Mary's and Santa Clara are both good chilis. The Gaels are
on their way to tln'ir best post-war cage season. Stanford dropped St.
Mary's early in the year when the two clubs met at Oakland Auditorium.
However the Moragaus have come a long way since then. Santa Clara is
a sporadic ball chili but is always dangerous, as evidenced by their last
game, a win over the UCLA Bruins in the same Cow Palace.
Just one more point about the Cow Palace. It seems too bad, that Frank
Walsh, bow-tie king of the Palace, scheduled both Stanford games as the
7:45 curtain raisers on the doubleheader. The policy in the past for a team
making a two night stand has been to play the early game on one night and
the late game, the 9:?»(J one, on the other evening. Seems that this provides
more opportunity for late dinner eaters to get to the arena, which is a bit
distant from residential districts of San Francisco, and still see their favorite
team.
Another strange factor, which is paradoxical with Stanford's cellar
dwelling spot in the Conference, is that Stanford is up among the first half
dozen in the Nation on free throw percentages. The Cards are currently
hovering around 70 per cent.
This is the year of the Olympics and once again the United States is
planning to send a basketball team to the Gaines. We wonder why the
team chosen is not an all-star aggregation, (lather, it is a team made up I
of players picked from only two teams.
Under the setup to be used this Olympics, the first four teams in the AAU
Tournament, the two finalists from the NCAA Tournaments and the winners
of the National Invitational at New York and National Intercollegiate at
Kansas City can qualify for the Olympic trials. Seven players from each
of the two teams which reach the finals of the trials will be chosen for the
Olympic squad.
We would like to see a coaching board select the squad in the same
manner as All-American gridders are selected. If this were done, an out
standing player on the poor team would not get left out in the cold when
his club failed to make any of the post season tourneys.
lILKL WK GO. Hate to bring up that bitter word football, but we are
glad to see that Stanford opens this year with Santa Clara on Sept. 20. The
Broncos were originally scheduled for Nov. 1, and USF was billed as the !
opener. But when the Dons dropped football. Sept. 20 was available. Santa I
Clara was shifted from the Nov. date to the opening spot, and San Jose State,
previously left off the Card sked, took Santa Clara's place Nov. 1.
It will be nice to open with the Broncos and get them behind us, be
cause they have a habit of growing meaner and meaner as the season
wears on. Incidentally the Indians play seven games at home, including j
one with Michigan. Only the Big Game, and the UCLA and Washington
State tilts are played on the road. It is quite a schedule.

Mary's early in the year when the two clubs met at Oakland Auditorium.
However the Moragaus have come a long way since then. Santa Clara is
a sporadic ball chili but is always dangerous, as evidenced by their last
game, a win over the UCLA Bruins in the same Cow Palace.
Just one more point about the Cow Palace. It seems too bad, that Frank
Walsh, bow-tie king of the Palace, scheduled both Stanford games as the
7:45 curtain raisers on the doubleheader. The policy in the past for a team
making a two night stand has been to play the early game on one night and
the late game, the 9:?»(J one, on the other evening. Seems that this provides
more opportunity for late dinner eaters to get to the arena, which is a bit
distant from residential districts of San Francisco, and still see their favorite
team.
Another strange factor, which is paradoxical with Stanford's cellar
dwelling spot in the Conference, is that Stanford is up among the first half
dozen in the Nation on free throw percentages. The Cards are currently
hovering around 70 per cent.
This is the year of the Olympics and once again the United States is
planning to send a basketball team to the Gaines. We wonder why the
team chosen is not an all-star aggregation, (lather, it is a team made up I
of players picked from only two teams.
Under the setup to be used this Olympics, the first four teams in the AAU
Tournament, the two finalists from the NCAA Tournaments and the winners
of the National Invitational at New York and National Intercollegiate at
Kansas City can qualify for the Olympic trials. Seven players from each
of the two teams which reach the finals of the trials will be chosen for the
Olympic squad.
We would like to see a coaching board select the squad in the same
manner as All-American gridders are selected. If this were done, an out
standing player on the poor team would not get left out in the cold when
his club failed to make any of the post season tourneys.
lILKL WK GO. Hate to bring up that bitter word football, but we are
glad to see that Stanford opens this year with Santa Clara on Sept. 20. The
Broncos were originally scheduled for Nov. 1, and USF was billed as the !
opener. But when the Dons dropped football. Sept. 20 was available. Santa I
Clara was shifted from the Nov. date to the opening spot, and San Jose State,
previously left off the Card sked, took Santa Clara's place Nov. 1.
It will be nice to open with the Broncos and get them behind us, be
cause they have a habit of growing meaner and meaner as the season
wears on. Incidentally the Indians play seven games at home, including j
one with Michigan. Only the Big Game, and the UCLA and Washington
State tilts are played on the road. It is quite a schedule.

After seeing the Phillips Oilers-Stanford game, we feel that Stanford will
win the PCC Southern Division.
The fight and drive the varsity showed last Saturday enabled them to
turn in one ol the finest Stanford performances ever seen on the Pavilion
floor. We realize that it isn't every night a team gets the opportunity tc
knock off the Oilers. But if Stanford can only generate the fight and de
termination in their six remaining conference games that they did last week,
future foes had better watch out. This Stanford team is one of the best we
have seen when it is playing the game to the hilt.
By way of not, two of Stanford's three upcoming conference foes, USC
and California, have had games in the Hawaiian Islands. The teams that
they met did not provide the competition that improves a term one bit.
Stanford, one the other hand, met the Stewarts and the Oilers, two of the
nation's toughest teams. It should make a lot of difference when the Con
ference race resumes in ten days.
On Friday and Saturday nights of this week, Stanford plays in the Cow
