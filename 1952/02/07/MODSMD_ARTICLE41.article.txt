# First String Cage Outscores Reserves, 20 to 18
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Speed, drive, and hustle were the keynotes of practice yesterday
as Stanford's basketball squad gets ready for the two toughest
Coast independents, St. Marys' and Santa Clara.
Coach Bob Burnett put his charges through a spirited workout
which included a number of game-condition scrimmages. In thfe

final and most important scrimmage,' 1
a team composed of Walsh, Tucker,
Ramstead, Suzdaleff, and Tomsic pre
vailed over a second-string outfit of
Zaninovich, Iversen, Andrews, De-
Long and Johnson. The score was
20-18.
Torn DuFour, Fritz Fenster, Bill
Stevenson, and Dave Epperson al
ternated with the second stringers
and looked good on defense.
Coach Burnett, in keeping with his
two-platoon system, had the second
platoon stress ball-control while the
first-stringers were concentrating on
the fast break.
Jim Ramstead and Ed Tucker were
high with six points each and Olie

SuzdalefT, Tom Dufour, Dave Epper
son, and Bruce Iversen were next
with four.
Epperson Looks flood
Epperson, the fi'6" center who has
been out with a cold, gave indication
that he may see quite a bit of action
in the two games over the weekend.
Big Ep looked good on the boards
and his passing and floor play were
very sharp.
In substituting a platoon at a time,
Burnett may be introducing some
thing new in the way of basketball

coaching. The advantages of such a
system are manifold. They can be
listed as follows:
Platoon System Advantageous
First, it gives the boys on the two
platoons a better chance to work
together as a team. Card fans can
recall the smoothness which the sec
ond platoon displayed when working
as a team; a smoothness which might
not he found in a unit of mixed
second and first-stringers.
Secondly, the opposition is forced
to face two different offensive pat
terns in succession; one using a fast
break, and one stressing ball-control.
Different defensive patterns would

also be used.
Finally, it would give each platoon
a good rest at a time. The opposition
would always be facing a rested
team, a factor that would tend to
make up for any real ability differ
ences.
Broncs, Gaels No Pushovers
In Santa Clara and St. Mary's,
Stanford will be facing what Coach
Burnett describes as the "toughest
two Pacific Coast Independents."
Santa Clara turned in an outstanding
upset last week when they knocked
off UCLA in the Cow Palace.
In G'B" Ben Gibson, St. Mary's has
the man who is currently leading the
Pacific Coast Independents in scor
ing. Big Ben is averaging 19.8
points per game, well ahead of his
nearest competitor, George Clark of
San Jose State.
The games will start at 7:45 and
50 cents plus a student body card will
cover the admission.

SET FOR WEEKEND TIFFS —Jim Ramstead, high scoring center,
and Bruce Iversen, smooth guard, will play a big part in Bob
Burnett's weekend plans. Ramstead will start against Santa
Clara and St. Mary's, while blond Bruce will see a lot of action.
