# Political Mystery--Who's Who in '52
## 
### HADLEY ROFF 
The blizzard of uncertainty h
fading from the nation's political
scene as the politicos oil up the ma
chines for the 1952 Presidential
running.
President Harry Truman shed
some light on his intentions yester
day when he reversed a previous
decision and said that he was ready
and willing to do battle in the New
Hampshire primary where he'll
square off against coonskin-capped
Estes Kel'auver for the Democratic
bid.
Last Thursday Truman told the
nation that he considers primaries
"so much eyewash" and flatly re
fused to enter the New Hampshire
fight. At the request of national
Democratic headquarters he recon
sidered, however, officials close to
the President said.
Truman himself claims that "the
move doesn't mean one thing or the
other" but says that he is entering
the primary at "the suggestion of
the National Committee and many
good New Hampshire Democrats.'
Coon-Hat Candidate
Some political dopesters claim
that the President's move is an at
tempt by Democratic big-shots to
squelch the Kefauver campaign be
fore the government housecleaner
from Tennessee can point up the
political implications of his recent
crime investigations.
Stepping hard on the toes of old
time Democrats, Kefauver told re
porters last week that "I don't
think" Truman's administration has
done much to sweep out corruption.
Amplifying his remarks, the tall
Senator stated that "the unholy al
liance between the criminal element
and some men in politics is not only
expensive, but it is destructive to
our country."
Candidate Shopping
According to some reports, Tru
man has been shopping the political
markets for a sucessor. Listed as
top man in Truman's favor is Fred

M. Vinson, Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court. Vinson told friends,
however, that he wants to stay on
the bench.
Rated in the second place on the
Truman hit parade is Adlai Steven
son, Illinois' Governor. Stevenson
huddled with the President for
more than an hour and a half last
week in a meeting still shrouded
with "no comments."
California Governor Earl Warren
is a dark horse for the Republican
party.
The rising five>star itansan, 'Tke"
Eisenhower, is the quantity "X" in
the dawning Presidential test. Wor
rying both Democrats and Republi

can', the"I like Ike" fever has
spurred thunderous reaction from
both camps. It's perhaps "Mr. Re
publican," Sen. Robert A. Taft, who
is presently waging the most deter
mined anti-Ike campaign. Both Ike
and Taft will meet in New Hamp
shire, and Eisenhower's now nebu
lous political support will have its
first opportunity of expression.
Taft backers claim that at the
moment they have locked up tight
er than a miser's safe 312 of the fiOIJ
votes needed to win the nomination
at the July convention. Eisenhower,
they say, can count on but 210 votes.
However, even Taft's forces arc
compelled to admit that everything
is not sewn up as carefully as it
might be. Eisenhower is gaining
Republican support from the South
and picking up additional backing
as "1 like Ike" clubs spring up
across the nation.
l'eople Confused
Doubt hinders the development
of a general rush to the Ike band
wagon, however, as people remain
confused over Eisenhower's stand
on many domestic issues.
Opinion ranges like a rainbow on
Eisenhower's stand. Richard Ro
ve re offered one interpretation in
his Washington Column for the New
Yorker magazine. He described Ei
senhower's position as approaching
"the extreme right in European
politics."
The New Yorker writer said that
Eisenhower would be the most con
servative President since Herbert
Hoover. Rovere bases his conclusion
on several statements by the gen
eral in which he likened social se
curity to "serving a lifetime sen
tence in a federal prison."
On the California level, Stanford

The blizzard of uncertainty h
fading from the nation's political
scene as the politicos oil up the ma
chines for the 1952 Presidential
running.
President Harry Truman shed
some light on his intentions yester
day when he reversed a previous
decision and said that he was ready
and willing to do battle in the New
Hampshire primary where he'll
square off against coonskin-capped
Estes Kel'auver for the Democratic
bid.
Last Thursday Truman told the
nation that he considers primaries
"so much eyewash" and flatly re
fused to enter the New Hampshire
fight. At the request of national
Democratic headquarters he recon
sidered, however, officials close to
the President said.
Truman himself claims that "the
move doesn't mean one thing or the
other" but says that he is entering
the primary at "the suggestion of
the National Committee and many
good New Hampshire Democrats.'
Coon-Hat Candidate
Some political dopesters claim
that the President's move is an at
tempt by Democratic big-shots to
squelch the Kefauver campaign be
fore the government housecleaner
from Tennessee can point up the
political implications of his recent
crime investigations.
Stepping hard on the toes of old
time Democrats, Kefauver told re
porters last week that "I don't
think" Truman's administration has
done much to sweep out corruption.
Amplifying his remarks, the tall
Senator stated that "the unholy al
liance between the criminal element
and some men in politics is not only
expensive, but it is destructive to
our country."

According to some reports, Tru
man has been shopping the political
markets for a sucessor. Listed as
top man in Truman's favor is Fred

M. Vinson, Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court. Vinson told friends,
however, that he wants to stay on

Hampshire primary where he'll
square off against coonskin-capped
Estes Kel'auver for the Democratic
bid.
Last Thursday Truman told the
nation that he considers primaries
"so much eyewash" and flatly re
fused to enter the New Hampshire
fight. At the request of national
Democratic headquarters he recon
sidered, however, officials close to
the President said.
Truman himself claims that "the
move doesn't mean one thing or the
other" but says that he is entering
the primary at "the suggestion of
the National Committee and many
good New Hampshire Democrats.'
Coon-Hat Candidate
Some political dopesters claim
that the President's move is an at
tempt by Democratic big-shots to
squelch the Kefauver campaign be
fore the government housecleaner
from Tennessee can point up the
political implications of his recent
crime investigations.
Stepping hard on the toes of old
time Democrats, Kefauver told re
porters last week that "I don't
think" Truman's administration has
done much to sweep out corruption.
Amplifying his remarks, the tall
Senator stated that "the unholy al
liance between the criminal element
and some men in politics is not only
expensive, but it is destructive to
our country."
Candidate Shopping
According to some reports, Tru
man has been shopping the political
markets for a sucessor. Listed as
top man in Truman's favor is Fred

M. Vinson, Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court. Vinson told friends,
however, that he wants to stay on
the bench.
Rated in the second place on the
Truman hit parade is Adlai Steven
son, Illinois' Governor. Stevenson
huddled with the President for
more than an hour and a half last
week in a meeting still shrouded
with "no comments."
California Governor Earl Warren
is a dark horse for the Republican
party.
The rising five>star itansan, 'Tke"
Eisenhower, is the quantity "X" in
the dawning Presidential test. Wor
rying both Democrats and Republi

can', the"I like Ike" fever has
spurred thunderous reaction from
both camps. It's perhaps "Mr. Re
publican," Sen. Robert A. Taft, who
is presently waging the most deter
mined anti-Ike campaign. Both Ike
and Taft will meet in New Hamp
shire, and Eisenhower's now nebu
lous political support will have its
first opportunity of expression.
Taft backers claim that at the
moment they have locked up tight
er than a miser's safe 312 of the fiOIJ
votes needed to win the nomination
at the July convention. Eisenhower,
they say, can count on but 210 votes.
However, even Taft's forces arc
compelled to admit that everything
is not sewn up as carefully as it
might be. Eisenhower is gaining
Republican support from the South
and picking up additional backing
as "1 like Ike" clubs spring up
across the nation.
l'eople Confused
Doubt hinders the development
of a general rush to the Ike band
wagon, however, as people remain
confused over Eisenhower's stand
on many domestic issues.
Opinion ranges like a rainbow on
Eisenhower's stand. Richard Ro
ve re offered one interpretation in
his Washington Column for the New
Yorker magazine. He described Ei
senhower's position as approaching
"the extreme right in European
politics."
The New Yorker writer said that
Eisenhower would be the most con
servative President since Herbert
Hoover. Rovere bases his conclusion
on several statements by the gen
eral in which he likened social se
curity to "serving a lifetime sen
tence in a federal prison."
On the California level, Stanford
erad John Steiger is bidding for the
Congressional nomination in the

*'y11) District near Oceanside. Stci
