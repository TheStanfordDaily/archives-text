conclude the story of the Free University.)
Founded in protest of Soviet oppression, the Free University of

Berlin began in 1948 with a
chair and two telephones as equip
ment. Three months later, 5,000 stu
dents were besieging the Free Uni
versity for admission, while 35 pro
fessors had walked across town from
the Eastern Zone and Soviet-con
trolled education to the Western
Zone and the Free University.
After the Soviet conquest of Ber
lin in 1045, the Russians made it
clear they intended to dominate the
old University of Berlin. A Russian
plan for exclusive jurisdiction in re
opening the institution was protested
by the Western powers, but the Sov
iet veto in the Allied Control Council
settled the argument before it start
ed.

Three months later, the bomb
battered university was opened by
the Russians to 2,000 carefully
screened students, selected for their
"working class" background. These
students tried to gain control of the
university by promoting Red rallies.
In 194f>, the Soviets attacked the
university's libraries, removing most
of the books by Western scholars
from the shelves.
In 1047, the first chairman of the
working committee, who had opposed
a political rally, was mysteriously
arrested. Seven other students were
kidnapped at the same time. A year
later, these students were discovered
at a Russian concentration camp at i
Sachsenhausen. Approximately 50

students were kidnapped in 1047 and
early 1048 for political opposition.
By April 1048, the admissions com
mittee permitted only the "politically
oriented" or children of "workers"
to enroll in the university.
Editors Expelled
But on April l(j, 1D48, the Soviets
overplayed their hand. The three
editors of the student paper were
expelled because of their articles at
tacking Russian handling of the uni
versities in the Eastern Zone. As a
result, all the non-communist stu
dent. council members resigned in
protest. More than 1,000 students at
tended a mass meeting just outside
the Russian sector to condemn the
action.
The West Berlin Government,
urged by the students and a hand
ful of professors, then voted to pro
ceed with the establishment of a
new university.
The first term of the Free Univer
sity opened in November, 1048. A
point system was used to determine
which of the 5,000 applicants would
be accepted for the fir: I class. Points
were given for previous academic
records, for resistance to Nazism, and
for opposition to Communism. Politi
cal refugees from the Russian Zone
got a special break. Especially poor
students were given scholarships.
And girls were given an equal chance
—something unheard of in Germany!


FOREIGN RELIEF—A student from the Russian Zone selects
books for use at the Free University. His face is blacked out to
prevent Russian knowledge of his whereabouts, in order to save
his relatives (who are still in the East Zone) from Soviet persecu
tion.

result, all the non-communist stu
dent. council members resigned in
protest. More than 1,000 students at
tended a mass meeting just outside
the Russian sector to condemn the
action.
The West Berlin Government,
urged by the students and a hand
ful of professors, then voted to pro
ceed with the establishment of a
new university.
The first term of the Free Univer
sity opened in November, 1048. A
point system was used to determine
which of the 5,000 applicants would
be accepted for the fir: I class. Points
were given for previous academic
records, for resistance to Nazism, and
for opposition to Communism. Politi
cal refugees from the Russian Zone
got a special break. Especially poor
students were given scholarships.
And girls were given an equal chance
—something unheard of in Germany!


FOREIGN RELIEF—A student from the Russian Zone selects
books for use at the Free University. His face is blacked out to
prevent Russian knowledge of his whereabouts, in order to save
his relatives (who are still in the East Zone) from Soviet persecu

Founded in protest of Soviet oppression, the Free University of

Berlin began in 1948 with a
chair and two telephones as equip
ment. Three months later, 5,000 stu
dents were besieging the Free Uni
versity for admission, while 35 pro
fessors had walked across town from
the Eastern Zone and Soviet-con
trolled education to the Western
Zone and the Free University.
After the Soviet conquest of Ber
lin in 1045, the Russians made it
clear they intended to dominate the
old University of Berlin. A Russian
plan for exclusive jurisdiction in re
opening the institution was protested
by the Western powers, but the Sov
iet veto in the Allied Control Council
settled the argument before it start
ed.

Three months later, the bomb
battered university was opened by
the Russians to 2,000 carefully
screened students, selected for their
"working class" background. These
students tried to gain control of the
university by promoting Red rallies.
In 194f>, the Soviets attacked the
university's libraries, removing most
of the books by Western scholars
from the shelves.
In 1047, the first chairman of the
working committee, who had opposed
a political rally, was mysteriously
arrested. Seven other students were
kidnapped at the same time. A year
later, these students were discovered
at a Russian concentration camp at i
Sachsenhausen. Approximately 50

students were kidnapped in 1047 and
early 1048 for political opposition.
By April 1048, the admissions com
mittee permitted only the "politically
oriented" or children of "workers"
to enroll in the university.

But on April l(j, 1D48, the Soviets
overplayed their hand. The three
editors of the student paper were
expelled because of their articles at
