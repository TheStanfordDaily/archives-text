# Class Rings Sell Today at Discount
## 
### 
Class of '52 senior rings will go
on special sale today at the Book
store. The sale will last just one
day, and a factory representative
will be on hand to take orders.
A $10 deposit is required as a
minimum payment, and there will
be no rebates on the rings bought
during this sale. The factory price
will be less than the regular Book
store one on which there is a re
bate.
It takes approximately three
months to receive a ring once it has
been ordered, either from the Book
store or from this sale. Graduates
will be assured of getting their rings
by June if they order them now.
