# Students Have Big Voice In Free University Affairs
##

(Editor's note: This is the fourth in a series on the recipients
oi the allforeiqn relief drive, which starts today. Today's article
concludes the story of the Free University of Berlin, begun in
yesterday's Daily.)
Excom may have broad powers, but the Student Council of Ihe
Free University of Berlin directs the feeding, housing, and clothing
of its student body, besides having an important voice in the ap
pointment of professors and the organization of curriculum.
Today, four years after its founding, the Free University of Berlin

has 5,300 students, and nearly all
the professorial chairs are filled.
Student leaders are now trying to
create a modified American - style
college spirit at the Free University.
It is hoped that the disillusioned
youth that Hitler left behind will
eventually feel they are part of a
democratic community.
Stanford has played a large part
in the university's growth; and Dr.
Hans von Kress, rector of the Free
University, has written Stanford
about this quarter's all-foreign re
lief chive: "Permit me to express
my sincere thanks to you and to all
the students at your University for
the concern which this project once
again shows them to have in our
Universtiy and in the fate of the
students suffering under the totali
tarian regime of the Soviet Zone."
One of the projects now under
way between Stanford and the Free
University is the exchange of stu
dents. This year Phil Neilsen is
studying at the Free University,
while Hella Reglin of the Free Uni
versity is studying here. There are
more than 50 students from abroad

studying at the Free University, but
so far not many German students
have been invited to study outside
of Germany. Stanford is one of the
few schools in the United States
that is engaged in an active ex
change scholarship program with
the Free University.
Stanford has been sending aid to
the Free University since it first
came into being. In 1948, the ASSU
sent 2Vfe tons of clothing plus sev
eral food packages to the Free Uni
versity via the Berlin airlift.
In 1049 and 1950, 1,523 garments
were sent to 500 students; 80 pairs
of shoes to 80 students, and 417 gar
ments and shoes to children of mar
ried students. Enough sole leather
was sent for 100 pairs of shoes. By
spring, 1950, $350 had been sent to
buy books.
The Free University of Berlin will
receive 30 per cent of this quarter's
all-foreign relief drive.
