### PETE GROTHE 
STANFORD AND RACIAL PREJUDICE
It's come to my attention that an otherwise capable
and able Stanford professor has made slurring re
marks in class about certain racial and religious
gioups. And so, time now to discuss racial prejudice
ut Stanford.
Racial prejudice is a subject that has always been
Widely discussed, and one that is burning and vit d
as long as it continues to exist. Fortunately, it doesn't

pose much of a problem here at
Stanford, but as long as even one
professor mouths intolerant state
ments, I think it deserves the stu
dents' critical attention.
Were this an open letter to that
professor, I would say to him this:
That if a student comes out of
Stanford having learned the les
son of good citizenship and. of
Christian regard for his fellow
man, no matter what, his skin

color ox 1 belief may be, then this lesson is more im
portant than all the chemical formulas, historical
dates, and grammar rules that he can master.
1 think back two years ago when [ had a talk with
Dcnald E Close. It was during the Con Home Drive,
and Close, a Bilbo and Ronkiii worshipper, said to
me, ' i wouldn't give a cent to the Con Home Drive,
because it's an inter-racial affair."
Fortunately, Stanfordites who think like Dene Id E.
are lew and far between.

In tart, I always feel proud of the Farm bunch
ivhen i recall that three of the four standing ovations
that 1 have seen in eight, quarters here have been
for colored people. The first one was for legendary
Sam McDonald, when lie gave a speech in the Pavilion
at I lie Con Home Drive barbeque. The second stand
ing ovation was for Eddie Tucker, when he retired
from a basket Lai 1 game last season after scoring 31
point:;. The 2,500 spectators clapped their hands and
stamped their feet for three solid minutes for one
ot the finest persons and best athletes 112 know. The
third one was for Dr. Ralph Bundle, Nobel Peace
Prize winner when he addressed the model U.N. here
last year.
If larial harriers exist at all at Stanford, they
exist in (l.p fraternities. Ilul ihis is llie fault of lt,e
nationals rufher than (he local houses. I know of
several houses that wanted (â€¢) cross Hie racial lines,
but didn't do so Itftause tin- national headquarters
fuith many Southern chapters) would withdraw
funds from the Stanford houses.
7*he eating clubs on the other hand, without any
national diet urns to disturb them, have r< fused to
acknowledge that a word like racial prejudice exists.
'I hey have judged prorppctive pledges on giounds
other than race and religion.
I would leave the following thought, then, with the
protessoi Judge a person by the color of his char
acter and the color ol his heart, not by the color of
his skin.
