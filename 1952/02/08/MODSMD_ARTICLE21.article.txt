# NORTH AFRICAN TRAVELS
## Slums, Beauty Contrast In Cities 
### HOLBROOK TETER 
(Editor's note: Daily Night Editor Holbrook Teter
describes the splendor and the slums of cities alonf?
the North African Coast in his last aiticle on the
20,G00-mile tour of the Mediterranean he and two
companions took last summer.)
The green splendor of the Gaber, oasis—with 200,000
date-palms—welcomed us to Tunisia. The sad-proud
Tunisia of exiled France—"l'm 44 and I've never seen
Paris." The poor-strong Tunisia of Arab ambitions
and jealousies. The Tunisia of French bistros, wine,
and gas stations. The hard part of our journey was
over.
Tunis it- elf was a disappointment. But it was the
only such disappointment in all of French North
Africa. The other cities were beautit'ul—r-jnodein,
white, and clean. From sophisticated Algiers to
work-a-day Oran, from Bougie on the hiil to flower
ing Rabat, the cities were lovely and French, shining
brightly above their blue harbor waters.
And yet each was ugly Each had its "casbah," its
citadel, its slum—for the Arabs. Not all the Arabs
lived in it by any means, but many did. The poverty
and the disease, the dirt and the crowds were all there
and these things we had seen before in other coun
tries. But never so finally italicized, never so blar
ingly outlined as in these French cities of beauty.
We visited the famous "casbah" of Algiers —
walked through the winding smelly streets, watched
the children playing, their hands, feet and shaven 1
heads discolored by some medicine. The fill it, the
oppressive closeness, the idle wretched tie,s of this
section were an open sore in the middle of pms
pcrous Algiers.
From time to time we felt an underlying resent

ment again, '',t the French, or heard young Arabs ex
press nationalist desires But we caught no glimpse of
any plan or organization, any methodical opposition.
We drove along t'ie "turquoise coast" of Algeria,
lovelier than the Riveria, wildly and intensely beau
tiful. In Tenes we were stared down Ly the "one
eyes" (women covered from head to toe in a white
shroud, with only one painted eye revealed) and had
nightmares. In Oran we were treated to beer by the
U.S. Fleet on its first night in the town. All prices
had risen abruptly.
The Moorish influence in French Moroccan cities
differentiated them from all others we had seen.
Their handsome gales opened through (hick walls
tn the old sections of the city—the crowded markets,
the narrow streets Summed with men and donkeys,
the colorful mosques (which we were not allowed
to enter).
General Juin, then governor of French Morocco,
was leaving his post to woi k with SHAPE in France.
We attended the parade and ceremony given in his
honor at Casablanca. There for the first time we saw
Arab bigwigs, resplendent in their white robes.
Once again we were on the Atlantic: Coast, which
we followed up to Tangiers. AI. the border of the
International Zone, the customs officers discovered our
Yugoslavian Putnik play-money (tourist coupons
which are good only when used with the actual cur
rency, the dinar) and thought we were trying to
smuggle.
We finally persuaded them we were innocent and
reached Tangiers our last stop in Africa. We loaded
our weakened car on a Gibraltar bound steamer, and
the last we saw of the "dark continent" then were
the golden sands of Tangiers' crescent harbor.

Tunis it- elf was a disappointment. But it was the
only such disappointment in all of French North
Africa. The other cities were beautit'ul—r-jnodein,
white, and clean. From sophisticated Algiers to
work-a-day Oran, from Bougie on the hiil to flower
ing Rabat, the cities were lovely and French, shining
brightly above their blue harbor waters.
And yet each was ugly Each had its "casbah," its
citadel, its slum—for the Arabs. Not all the Arabs
lived in it by any means, but many did. The poverty
and the disease, the dirt and the crowds were all there
and these things we had seen before in other coun
tries. But never so finally italicized, never so blar
ingly outlined as in these French cities of beauty.
We visited the famous "casbah" of Algiers —
walked through the winding smelly streets, watched
the children playing, their hands, feet and shaven 1
heads discolored by some medicine. The fill it, the
oppressive closeness, the idle wretched tie,s of this
section were an open sore in the middle of pms
pcrous Algiers.
From time to time we felt an underlying resent

ment again, '',t the French, or heard young Arabs ex
press nationalist desires But we caught no glimpse of
any plan or organization, any methodical opposition.
We drove along t'ie "turquoise coast" of Algeria,
lovelier than the Riveria, wildly and intensely beau
tiful. In Tenes we were stared down Ly the "one
eyes" (women covered from head to toe in a white
shroud, with only one painted eye revealed) and had
nightmares. In Oran we were treated to beer by the
U.S. Fleet on its first night in the town. All prices
had risen abruptly.
The Moorish influence in French Moroccan cities
differentiated them from all others we had seen.
Their handsome gales opened through (hick walls
tn the old sections of the city—the crowded markets,
the narrow streets Summed with men and donkeys,
the colorful mosques (which we were not allowed
to enter).
General Juin, then governor of French Morocco,
was leaving his post to woi k with SHAPE in France.
We attended the parade and ceremony given in his
honor at Casablanca. There for the first time we saw
Arab bigwigs, resplendent in their white robes.
Once again we were on the Atlantic: Coast, which
we followed up to Tangiers. AI. the border of the
International Zone, the customs officers discovered our
Yugoslavian Putnik play-money (tourist coupons
which are good only when used with the actual cur
rency, the dinar) and thought we were trying to
smuggle.
We finally persuaded them we were innocent and
reached Tangiers our last stop in Africa. We loaded
our weakened car on a Gibraltar bound steamer, and
the last we saw of the "dark continent" then were
the golden sands of Tangiers' crescent harbor.
