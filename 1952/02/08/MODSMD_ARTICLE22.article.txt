# 'Will to Do' Is Great U.S. Lesson
## Foreign Scholar Cites Cooperation 
### BARBARA TUERK 
Community spirit and nation
al will ior co-operation when
there is a task to be done are,
according to Hans Halbheer,
ASSU exchange scholar from
Switzerland, the greatest lessons
the United Stales can teach the
world today.
"I cannot say often enough," he
repeated again and again, "that we
need you and you need us. We
must all sacrifice everything for one
goal, the salvation of our common
Western civilization."
i.ike most foreign students, Hans
marvels at our lack of awareness
of the present world situation. This,
he theorizes, is due to the sudden
ness of the shifts in our foreign pol
icy.
Europeans realize that we have
had practically no preparation at all
for our present role. Yet in a few
short years not only our foreign
policy but our public opinion has
switched from isolationism to in
ternationalism.
Little Discussion
Still there is little discussion in
America of the implications of thif
switch. In contrast, in Hans's fra
ternity in Switzerland pledges hau
to participate in two educational
meetings a week, as well as in the
manV social activities.
On Monday nights the whole
chapter met for a lecture or discus
sion on cultural or political issues;
and on Friday nights the pledges
met alone for a special educational
survey of the history of Switzer
land. As "chief of pledges," Hans
was responsible for teaching the
1- riday meetings.
For an explanation of his coun
try's neutrality in the last war and
its refusal to enter the United Na

tions, Hans pointed cut the Swiss
tradition of complete independence
favored by her geographical posi
tion "on the roof of Europe."
He said that since their nation
was first set up as a buffer state
in 1815, the Swiss people have nevei
seriously considered enteimg any
war. "Spiritually, of course, there
can be no neutrality. Our sympa
thies are and always have be. n with
the free democracies."
Neutrality Nol Cheap
Hans emphasized the fact that
"neutrality is not at all cheap." lo
World War II Switzerland spent the
equivalent in purchasing power of
$500,000 a day to keep two-thirds
of its army fully mobilized at all
times.
When Switzerland's four million
population is compared with our
laO million, this becomes the equiv
alent of $17,500,000 daily for the
United States, a staggering sum in a
period of neutrality.
Hans said that the popular mis
conception that Hitler wasn't in
terested in Switzerland L nol true.

Despite the difficulty of invasion
(Switzr-i land's mountains are so
well fortified and her Final! army so
efficiently mobilized tliat it would
have taken 30-35 divisions for a
successful attack), Hitler's General
Staff had set a specific day in 1943
for invasion.
The attack was forestalled only
because on that very clay the Rus
sian.: • tarted a major offensive and
the extra divisions were needed tn
rcinforce the East.
IJMT Credited
Hans gave univer sal military
training, lung a Swiss policy, much
credit lor 1110 efficiency of the Swiss
army. Every male citizen receives
17 week', of tough basic training at
the age of 20. Until he is 48 tliis
training is supplemented regularly
Ly three-week training camps.
Every Swiss keeps his small arms
at home with him, anil knows ex
actly where to report in case of mo
bilization. Because of this policy,
! feasible only in a small country,
600,000 to 700,000 men can bp lully
mobilized within 48 hours. The
army is, however, equipped only for
defense.
Hans explained that Switzerland,
long one of the most prominent
supporters of the league of Nations,
did not join the UN because of the
clause requiring membet nations to
participate in warfare if the Secu
rity Council so decrees. The Swiss
| do, however, participate in all in
ternational organisations in which
their neutrality is not threatened.
"The theory that Switzerland re
mained out of the UN because it
wished to continue valuable trade
with lion Curtain nations just is
not true," lie declared. "Only 8
per cent ot her exports are to Corti
munist countiie: a far smaller per
centage than that of many UN na
tions."

supporters of the league of Nations,
did not join the UN because of the
clause requiring membet nations to

HANS HALBIIEER
—"We need you and you need us"
Community spirit and nation
al will ior co-operation when
there is a task to be done are,
according to Hans Halbheer,
ASSU exchange scholar from
Switzerland, the greatest lessons
the United Stales can teach the
world today.
"I cannot say often enough," he
repeated again and again, "that we
need you and you need us. We
must all sacrifice everything for one
goal, the salvation of our common
Western civilization."
i.ike most foreign students, Hans
marvels at our lack of awareness
of the present world situation. This,
he theorizes, is due to the sudden
ness of the shifts in our foreign pol
icy.
Europeans realize that we have
had practically no preparation at all
for our present role. Yet in a few
short years not only our foreign
policy but our public opinion has
switched from isolationism to in
ternationalism.
Little Discussion
Still there is little discussion in
America of the implications of thif
switch. In contrast, in Hans's fra
ternity in Switzerland pledges hau
to participate in two educational
meetings a week, as well as in the
manV social activities.
On Monday nights the whole
chapter met for a lecture or discus
sion on cultural or political issues;
and on Friday nights the pledges
met alone for a special educational
survey of the history of Switzer
land. As "chief of pledges," Hans
was responsible for teaching the
1- riday meetings.
For an explanation of his coun
try's neutrality in the last war and
its refusal to enter the United Na

tions, Hans pointed cut the Swiss
tradition of complete independence
favored by her geographical posi
tion "on the roof of Europe."
He said that since their nation
was first set up as a buffer state
in 1815, the Swiss people have nevei
seriously considered enteimg any
war. "Spiritually, of course, there
can be no neutrality. Our sympa
thies are and always have be. n with
the free democracies."
Neutrality Nol Cheap
Hans emphasized the fact that
"neutrality is not at all cheap." lo
World War II Switzerland spent the
equivalent in purchasing power of
$500,000 a day to keep two-thirds
of its army fully mobilized at all
times.
When Switzerland's four million
population is compared with our
laO million, this becomes the equiv
alent of $17,500,000 daily for the
United States, a staggering sum in a
period of neutrality.
Hans said that the popular mis
conception that Hitler wasn't in
terested in Switzerland L nol true.

Despite the difficulty of invasion
(Switzr-i land's mountains are so
well fortified and her Final! army so
efficiently mobilized tliat it would
have taken 30-35 divisions for a
successful attack), Hitler's General
Staff had set a specific day in 1943
for invasion.
The attack was forestalled only
because on that very clay the Rus
sian.: • tarted a major offensive and
the extra divisions were needed tn
rcinforce the East.

thies are and always have be. n with
the free democracies."
Neutrality Nol Cheap
Hans emphasized the fact that
"neutrality is not at all cheap." lo
World War II Switzerland spent the
equivalent in purchasing power of
$500,000 a day to keep two-thirds
of its army fully mobilized at all
times.
When Switzerland's four million
population is compared with our
laO million, this becomes the equiv
alent of $17,500,000 daily for the
United States, a staggering sum in a
period of neutrality.
Hans said that the popular mis
conception that Hitler wasn't in
terested in Switzerland L nol true.

Despite the difficulty of invasion
(Switzr-i land's mountains are so
well fortified and her Final! army so
efficiently mobilized tliat it would
have taken 30-35 divisions for a
successful attack), Hitler's General
Staff had set a specific day in 1943
for invasion.
The attack was forestalled only
because on that very clay the Rus
sian.: • tarted a major offensive and
the extra divisions were needed tn
rcinforce the East.
IJMT Credited
Hans gave univer sal military
training, lung a Swiss policy, much
credit lor 1110 efficiency of the Swiss
army. Every male citizen receives
17 week', of tough basic training at
the age of 20. Until he is 48 tliis
training is supplemented regularly
Ly three-week training camps.
Every Swiss keeps his small arms
at home with him, anil knows ex
actly where to report in case of mo
bilization. Because of this policy,
! feasible only in a small country,
600,000 to 700,000 men can bp lully
mobilized within 48 hours. The
army is, however, equipped only for
defense.
Hans explained that Switzerland,
long one of the most prominent
supporters of the league of Nations,
did not join the UN because of the
clause requiring membet nations to
participate in warfare if the Secu
rity Council so decrees. The Swiss
| do, however, participate in all in
ternational organisations in which
their neutrality is not threatened.
"The theory that Switzerland re
mained out of the UN because it
wished to continue valuable trade
with lion Curtain nations just is
not true," lie declared. "Only 8
per cent ot her exports are to Corti
munist countiie: a far smaller per
centage than that of many UN na
tions."

HANS HALBIIEER
—"We need you and you need us"
Community spirit and nation
al will ior co-operation when
there is a task to be done are,
according to Hans Halbheer,
ASSU exchange scholar from
Switzerland, the greatest lessons
the United Stales can teach the
world today.
"I cannot say often enough," he
repeated again and again, "that we
need you and you need us. We
must all sacrifice everything for one
goal, the salvation of our common
Western civilization."
i.ike most foreign students, Hans
marvels at our lack of awareness
of the present world situation. This,
he theorizes, is due to the sudden
ness of the shifts in our foreign pol
icy.
Europeans realize that we have
had practically no preparation at all
for our present role. Yet in a few
short years not only our foreign
policy but our public opinion has
switched from isolationism to in
ternationalism.
Little Discussion
Still there is little discussion in
America of the implications of thif
switch. In contrast, in Hans's fra
ternity in Switzerland pledges hau
to participate in two educational
meetings a week, as well as in the
manV social activities.
On Monday nights the whole
chapter met for a lecture or discus
sion on cultural or political issues;
and on Friday nights the pledges
met alone for a special educational
survey of the history of Switzer
land. As "chief of pledges," Hans
was responsible for teaching the
1- riday meetings.
For an explanation of his coun
try's neutrality in the last war and
its refusal to enter the United Na

tions, Hans pointed cut the Swiss
tradition of complete independence
favored by her geographical posi
tion "on the roof of Europe."
He said that since their nation
was first set up as a buffer state
in 1815, the Swiss people have nevei
seriously considered enteimg any
war. "Spiritually, of course, there
can be no neutrality. Our sympa
thies are and always have be. n with
the free democracies."
