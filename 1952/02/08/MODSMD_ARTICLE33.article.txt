## Face Navy Card Boxers Look Good In Losing to Cal Poly. 5-4 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Revenge will be the motive when j
Stanford's varsity wrestlers take on
Alameda Naval Air Station tonight.
The meet will be staged in the j
Men's Gym and the matches will get '
und m' way at 7 p.m. Stanford faced
die Flyers once already this season
and was hande I a IG-15 defeat. This :
time, however, the Cards will be at j
full strength and will probably be |
favored.
Dave Wong, last year's number
one man in the 123-pound division, [
will wrestle tonight for the first
time this season. He will go at 130 j
pounds. Dave had stayed out to de
vote more time to his studies, but
student - coach Don Williams- has
succeeded in persuading him to
compete.
The Cards will start George Rus
sell in the 137-pound class. George,
who had been out with a shoulder !
injury earlier in the season, has
been coming through in tine style
lately. Against San Jose State, |
George registered the only Stanford 1
pin of the match.
Bob Jessen will go at 147 pounds; I
Ken James will wrestle in the 157- t
pound class; and in the IG7-pound i
division, Stanford will go with j
freshman sensation Pat Madden.
Madden was undefeated going into
tilt l six-way tourney at San Jose last
week. He has been called on to i
wrestle several times in a heavier j
weight class this season.
Steady and reliable Jack Ogelsby
will be the Card nominee at 177 '
pounds, and Rod Garner will be the
heavyweight choice. Ogelsby had j
the btvst record of any Stanford
grappler at the San Jose tourna
ment, and Garner, having com
pletely shaken off his cold, will be
ready to go at full strength.
Outstanding men for the Flyers
will be Roy Smith, heavyweight,
and Bob McFarlane. their 177-
pound competing coach.
There will also be a series of
junior varsity matches. Although
the matches are indefinite so far,
Norm Manoogian, Al Colton, and
led Zsutty are the entries in the
heavyweight, light-heavy, and 1 f>7-
pound classes respectively.

Five knockouts highlighted last
night's Stanford - Cal Poly boxing
matches held before 230 tans in the
Pavilion. The Cal boys won the slug
fest by a 5 to 4 score.
In the feature match of the i
night, Stanford's Boh Baldocchi
decisioned Bill Lidderdale in the
105 - pound battle. Lidderdale
landed a bruising left in the lirst,
but Baldocchi came back and
clearly had the better of the tired
Lidderdale at the end.
Lefty Tony Wynn provided Card
fans with a happy surprise when he
TKO'd Bill Feeney in the second
round of their 175-pound match. A
Wynn left hook and right cross
brought two knockdowns in the sec
ond round.
Bob Chalmers outpointed Graf
Shintaku and Bob White won by
forfeit for Stanford's other two
wins.
Cal's mo t impressive fighters j
appeared to be 117-11). Paul Fish
back, who TKO'd Stanford's Ed
Scarhoro in the third round, and
heavyweight Jack Shaw, who
flattened Don Bay in the second
round of their light. Eishback
knocked down Scarhoro with a ]
right cross iii the second, but
Scarhoro was saved bv the bell.
Shaw flattened Day with a hor
rendous left iust as Day was com
ing in oil' the rope. Day was out
for about a minute.
In the 12G-pound class, Cal's John
Elder won a slow-starting, fast-fin
ishing slugfest from Gary Sievert
and Jim Herra TKO'd a badly out
classed Ron Hayes in the 175-pound
class.
Coach Ray Lunny said he was
proud of all his boys and amazed
that they did so well with the rough
Cal aggregation, who last week gave
San Jose's best team in the nation
a real scrap.
