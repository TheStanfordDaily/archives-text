# Braves Play Pair of Contests; Attempt Win Streak Extension
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
Stanford's red-hot Braves, boast
ing an 11-5 record and a four-game
win streak, are oft again this after
noon an J tomorrow afternoon as
they meet Lincoln High of San
Francisco and Floyd Lowe Realty,
an extremely fine AAU team from
the city.
Lincoln High is not expected to
be of the same caliber as Washing
ton High, probable city champs,
which the Braves played earlier in
the season. The score of that game
was 74 to 38 in favor of the Cards,
which leaves little doubt es to the
outcome of tomorrow's game.
The scales will be tipped in the
other direction on Saturday as the
Braves meet Floyd Lowe Realty, an
extremely (in? amateur team. The
Realtors are sparked by many ex-
Stanford and Pacific Coa: t basket
ball players.
Starting at one forward will be
Byron Van A 1 tyne, brother of ex-

Farm footballer Bruce Van Alstyne i
and first string for TjSC for two I
years. At the other forward will be |
Milt Iverson, Card letterman in '47,
"43, and '49.
At the center will be Kurt Pol
zine, former Modesto star and first
team center at Stanford until his
grades caught up with him. At the
guards will be Jack O'Sullivan, cap
tain of the Stanford varsity last
year, and Bob Anderson.
The team averages li tt. 2 in., with
O'Sullivan the smallest at 5 It. IOVj
in. Van Alstyne and Iversen are
each G ft. 2 in., Polzine is 0 ft. 4 in.,
and Anderson is 6 ft. 3 in.
The JV's will really come into
their own over the weekend, as the
Realtors are probably the best team
they will face all year. Fresh from
an upset victory over the McKunes
of San Jose, a team composed al
most entirely of ex-captains of the
SJS varsity and unbeaten for three
years, they will be heavy favorites
to win.
The Braves will play both games !
in their entirety, in contrast to their |
last two games which were started
by the second - team varsity. The
Braves and their first-half counter
parts had it out in a regulation
game last Mo.nday, with the second -
team varsity coming out on top in
a close, rough affairâ€”6l to 58.
The starting lineup will have
Roger Irvine and Dick Carver at
the forwards, 6-ft. 7-in. Russ Law
ler at the center spot, and George
Caras and Wayne Lockhart at the
guards.
