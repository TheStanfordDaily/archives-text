# Cave Society Given Funds
## 
### 
The Stanford Grotto of the Na
tional Speleological Society an
nounced yesterday that it had re
ceived additional funds which will
now cover transportation expenses
for members participating in expe
ditions.
The transportation fund, now
amounting to $500, represents dona
tions contributed to the Grotto by
Orley H. Truman of Hollywood,
well-known geophysicist, who has
also given valuable advice and other
assistance to the Grotto.
Previously field trips designed to
study and explore caves in various
sections of California have been
financed by the participants them
selves.
Under the new arrangement,
Grotto President Neely Bostick said,
any member of the Grotto will be
reimbursed for transportation. The
only requirement will be that they
co-operate in the cave surveys and
studies in accord with the society's
scientific objectives.
