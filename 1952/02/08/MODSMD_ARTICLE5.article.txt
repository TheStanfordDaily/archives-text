LONDON, Feb. 7, (UP)—Prime
Minister Winston Churchill tonight
commended to the mourning British
Empire the example of the late King
George VI who unafraid "walked
with death" through the last, illness
plagued months of his life.
Churchill spoke over the network
of the British Broadcasting Corpora
tion in a magnificant eulogy to the
deceased monarch and in reaffirma
tion of faith that Britain will rise
again to new heights of glory under
the reign of its young queen.
The 25-year-old Princess who left
London a week ago for what was to
have been a state tour of Australia
today flew home from Africa a Queen
and began her reign as Elizabeth II
—sovereign of the world's greatest
empire.
Her first sad duty was to authorize
a state funeral at St. George's Chap
el, Windsor, on Friday, Feb. 15, for
her father, King George VI, whose
death yesterday placed her on the
throne.
The Princess, who wept brokenly
yesterday on learning of the death
of her beloved father, returned to
her people a composed and dignified
sovereign. She even managed a brief
smile as she shook hands with an
uncle, the Duke of Gloucester, Prime
Minister Winston Churchill and a
dozen others of Britain's great men
who met her at the Tarmac to offer
their condolences and extend their
allegiance on behalf of the nation.
Tomorrow morning Elizabeth will
go before the August Privy Council
to take her oath at St. .Tames palace.
