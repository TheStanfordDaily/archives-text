PIVOT MAN — Here's big Jim Ramstead in action against the Santa Clara Broncos. Ramstead
tanked 12 points and played his usual smooth game as he and his mates took a good Bronc team
70-64, Saturday night in the Cow Palace. Here Ramstead takes a pass off from Ron Tomsic and
prepares to fire it to another teammate. Dick Garibaldi of the Broncs watches the proceedings.
