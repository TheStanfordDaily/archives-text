# HEALTH SERVICE
## Aid Within 10-Mile Area 
### BARNEY GLASER 
"The Stanford Health Service
functions only within a 10-mile
area around the campus," stated Dr.
George H. Ilouck, director of the
Health Service, in answer to the
question, "When and where can
students expect medical help?"
"The registered student is pro
vided with any kind of iw'dicsl
aid he may require once he is
within the designated limits, but
outside of this area the student
receives no care or benefits from
the Health Service," explained Dr.
Ilouck.
The fact that an injury occurs or
one is stricken with disease without
the 10-mile limit does not matter.
Once he is within the area the stu
dent is not asked when, why, or
how the illness or injury happened.
He is just asked where it hurts and
appropriate care follows.
As a typical case, Dr. Ilouck
cited a broken ankle received
while skiinrT. Usually the student
has an X-ray and a cast put on
wherever he is at his own ex
pense. Upon reaching the campus
the person goes to the Stanford
Health Service and is taken care
of from then on at Stanford's ex
pense.
It is Dr. Houck's wish that stu--'
dents feel free to take advantage of}
this service once they get within 1 ,
the 10-mile area.
Students must be registered at
Stanford during the quarter in
which they seek medical aid.
