(Editor's note: This is the fifth

ents of the current all-foreign re
lief drive.)
Earthquakes, floods, famine, and
the results of communal rioting are
only part of the concern of the
World University Service, which
disperses aid to students all over
the globe.
The WUS has three major func
tions: (1) emergency relief for stu
dents, with no discrimination of
race, religion, or nationality; (2)
building educational and cultural
ties through conferences, seminars,
study tours, etc; (3) research into
basic problems involving the uni
versity.
However, the major concern of
WUS is in the relief field. Yugo
slavia needs medicines. Germany
and France are crowded with
hundreds of refugee students. In
Cireece, tuberculosis is unduly
high. All these sore spots are
eased by WHS.
Stanford had a hand in creating
the World University Service.
Fourteen years ago Stanford stu
dents and professors gave funds to
help Chinese studetns who were j
fleeing from the Japanese and mi- !
grating into western Ch'na with
their universities. At. that time, the
relief program was supported by
college students across the nation
and was known as the Far Eastern
Student Relief Fund.
In 1942 Far Eastern Student Re
lief was combined with a similar
program for Europe. The result
ing combination was World Stu- j
dent Relief.
Following World War 11, World '
Student Relief played a key role in j
Europe and Asia. Students in Eu- |
rope returned by the hundreds of
thousands to their studies after
years in concentration camps, pris
ons, and work in underground re
sistance against Nazism.

Stanford students joined with
students in over .'W countries in
pooling resources to meet the
critical needs of these students.
'flip work of World Student Re
lief was made possible because the
organization operated on a self-help
basis, and did not consider itself a
charity.
Funds were transmitted into
mimeograph m a r hi ne s , Imiiilis,
med'eines, and X-ray equipment.
From these grew rest centers and
health clinics; work scholarships
which staled local '.elf-help com
mittees; and the essentials for co
operative hostels canteens, and
soybean milk facte,vies.
Willi the help of World Student
Relief, students in many war-rav
aged countries have become strong
enough to contribute to the budget
of WSR and ultimately to become
national living groups.

This year the work of WSR ex
panded to meet the shifting needs
of the university community, and
has become the World University
Service.
WUS is still aiding refugee «to
•lents <o resettle in other coun
fri< s. There are World Univer
sity DP centers in Munich, Paris,
I and Sal/burg. In fombloux,
5 ranee, is an international rest
renter called Chalet d"s Ftudiants
which serves students from all
! over Furope needing • p sl and
care. In (he Middle Fast, WUS is
building student ho; Icls for poor
| students.
Through the World University
Service, Stanford students will aid
students at the University of Delhi
in a hostel project. In addition, 2."i
| per cent of the all-foreign relief
drive will go to the general budget
i of WUS.


TEXTBOOKS MIMEOGRAPHED —Students at the University of
Salonika, Gre.ece, help to meet the urgent need for printed ma
tcriols by mimeographing their own textbooks. The World
University Service supports such projects as this.
