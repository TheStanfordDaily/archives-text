### DICK McLEAN 
A FRANK EVALUATION OF THIS
WOMAN SITUATION
A few recent letters to the editor concerning mixers
have raised some stir about the current women
situation here at Stanford. The problem of finding
girls, getting dates, and asking them out again is one
that faces everyone. But the horizon is not all gloom.
To this problem there are three solutions.
The first is time. The longer you are in the Uni
versity, the greater your chance of finding a date.
The peculiar reason for this is that fellows do not
a*, a rule ask out girls in a class ahead of them
selves. This means that an Encina freshman has a
restricted season on V-i of the female population
whereas a senior has open season on 4/4 of the girls.

You can easily see the situation.
With every passing year the eli
gible date ratio for a fellow in
creases but for the girls it de
creases. This explains the happy
grin on a male senior's face and
the desperate attempt at "good
headedness" on the part of a girl
who has been hei*e four anxious
years. If you're a frustrated lower
classman, look to a clock for con
solation. Each sweep of the hand
turns in your direction.

The second solution is approach. Approach is every
thing. You've got to be smooth, suave, debonaire,
casual, all in the right proportions. (It's like mixing
a good Martini.) It takes planning. It' you boom up
behind a girl, give her a playful swat, and say, "I
suppose you're all dated up fo the next week or so,"
she'll naturally say "yes." (Girls are sensitive about
things like that.)
What you've got to do is figure out youi subject
in advance and then put a definite battle into action.
If she's the motherly kind, pretend to be ill. Pull
a phony faint and then call to her weakly, "Miss,
Miss, would you be kind enough to help me?" She'll
immediately say, "You poor, poor boy. Come rest
your head on my bosom." This is not a half bud
way to begin a friendship.
If she's the intelligent type, pretend to need coach

ing. If she's one of those wonderful rare, dumb type,
pxetend to be an expert.
If she's the sophisticate type, criticize everything.
Refer to everyone as "immature," great literature as
"trite," modern art as "true expression," and the
New Yorker Magazine as "bible."
Know your subject, lay your plans, then attack.
Approach is what counts.
The third solution is for the administration to
change the entrance requirements for girls. Rixford
Synder a fine job as director of admissions but
I don't think he has the proper tools with which to
v/ork. Perhaps the entrance could be revised a bit.
For example:
ENTRANCE FORM
(Women)
I.eland Stanford Junior University
1) Why did you study so hard in high school?
2) How many dates a week did you average?
3) Have you ever won a beauty contest? Come in
second? Ever enter?
4) What color is your hair?
5) How do boys evaluate you? (Check one) Friends
; Pals ; Cute ——; Alluring ; Exotic
; Enticing .
6) Send five pictures of yourself in both formal and
informal attire—bathing suits, shorts, sweaters,
formals, suits—will be sufficient.
7) If you cannot meet basic minimum requirements
on grades, your character and other recommen
dations will be considered.
Because the director of admissions has a hard time
v/ith ail the applications, a group of school spirited,
undergraduate men would aid in the evaluation and
final selection.
And thus it is seen that with patience, planning,
and administrative aid this situation can be aleviat
ed. With time the girls begin to "shape up." With
the proper approach they begin to "brighten up,"
And with a new entrance evaluation, this, our Stan
ford family is liable to he blessed with some cute
baby sisters.
As for mixers, this general rule holds true, "With
every good mixer ice cubes are an essential in
gredient."
