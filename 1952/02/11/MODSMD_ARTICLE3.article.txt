# Allien Hit Harder

### 
TOKYO, Monday, Feb. 11â€”Allied
planes hurled the heaviest attack in
recent months at Communist supply
lines and barracks in North Korea
yesterday while U.S. Sabrejets held
off the Red air force.
One Russian-made MIG jet prob
ably was destroyed and two were
damaged in a series of high-speed
air duels. No American losses were
reported.
Troop and supply buildings were
especially hard hit. Near Haeju,
U.S. S-80 jets showered flaming
gasoline jelly on a troop housing
area, engulfing 85 buildings in a
sea of flame.
