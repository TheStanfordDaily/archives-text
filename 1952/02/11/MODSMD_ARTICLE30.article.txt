## Bull Session and Racial Prejudice 
### 
To the Editor:
With increasing anger I have read Mr. Grothe's
Bull Sessions this past quarter, in which he displays
a singular lack of original thinking, marvelous capac
ity for rooting trivial gossip out of Roble and Encina
and incorporating it into his column, and all the
while I've been thankful that Mr. Grothe has had the
good sense not to come out with his own opinions
which might further ruin his reputation.
But last Friday lie broke down and came forth
with some views on racial and religious prejudice.
I wai so incensed by the article thai I had to write'
this letter.
I can only deplore the utter triteness of Mr. Grothe's
views on racial and religious prejudice; his statements
are just as indicative of a bigoted mind to my way of
thinking as Mr. Close's more obvious views on the
subject. Such statements as '*1 always feel proud of
the form bunch when I recall the standing ovations

for colored people," show that Mr. Grothe makes an
inherent distinction in his own mind between Negroes
and Caucasians. Such trite sayings as "judge a person
by the color of his character and color of his heart
not by the color of his skin," or "Racial prejudice . . .
burning and vital as long as it continues to exist,"
and others, reveal Mr. Grothe as grossly unoriginal
and shallow.
The professor who expounded those views gave Mr.
Grothe the long-awaited opportunity to blow his own
horn. This man will piobably be humiliated by sin
cere members of minority groups who very properly
resent this intolerance and their words and actions
v/ill have much more of and effect on the professor
than Mr. Grothe's mumbo-jumbo.
I'm very much in favor of Bull Sessions dis
cussing serious problems once in a while; however
these articles should he intelligently written and
well thought out beforehand.
