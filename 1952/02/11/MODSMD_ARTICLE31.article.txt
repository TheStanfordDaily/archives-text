# Charity Driveâ€”A 'Common Sense Approach'
## 
### 
(This letter to the student body is being circulated
to students in connection with the all-campus drive
for foreign student relief. The diive ends Friday.)
Fellow Students:
"HELP THE WINDS OF FREEDOM BLOW!" A
catch phrase, yes, but so full of meaning.
Beginning today, and for one week, Stanford stu
dents and faculty are being given a unique oppor
tunity to brighten tomorrow for fellow students and
professors all over the world. This is more than a
charity drive. It is a common sense approach lo many
vital problems. For example:
At the University of Delhi, over one-third of
the students are refugees; ninety-six of these live
in tents the year around, and consider themselves
lucky to have that much shelter.
In Vienna, students run oft' mimeographed copies
of texts because they can't afford to buy books even
if such were available (which they are not).
Stanford has offered its help. Before you decide on
your contribution, think through the problem. Thou
sands of students and professors are suffering, and
some are dying because of a lack of aid. Your assist
ance will be a personal gain, not sacrifice. Your con
tribution is a safe investment in a better world for all.
DWIGHT ALLEN, Chairman
