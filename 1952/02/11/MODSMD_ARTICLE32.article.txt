# Mixer Comment Destructive
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I believe last Thursday's letter about Stanford
women was a very poor one. It was contradictory,
and destructive rather than constructive.
If Stanford women have so many dates per week
end, as the letter implied, naturally they wouldn't be
interested in mixers.
The general attitude expressed by the letter seems
to indicate that the anonymous authors were much
more interested in expressing a personal beef and
throwing some mud around than in alleviating their
deplorable date situation. Perhaps the idea of inviting
San Jose and Cal girls for a mixer is a good one. But
are the authors going to get off their tails and, as
suming they wish to come, bring these queens from
afar over here? I doubt it. That, they probably figure,

is for someone else to do. Alas, there are so many
talkers but so few doers.
Granted some of the women here have a very poor
attitude toward others, men in particular. This cer
tainly will not be improved by calling all Stanford
women a group of hard-no:,ed hags. Possibly the
authors will say Ihev had no intention of changing
them; they were simply expressing an opinion. Then
why cry on the shoulders of us all by writing a
letter to the editor?
The authors may be interested in knowing that the
average Stanford "man" is no prize package either.
As a Roble sponsor said to me, they are often quite
childish. I once went to a lot of trouble getting a
Saturday night date for a guy who came pleading
for one Saturday afternoon. Then he wouldn't speak
to me for a week because I didn't line him up with
a millionaire heiress-Miss-America combination.
Stanford men are unrealistic too.
