### 
To the Editor:
Since many students at Stanford Village do not
have cars, they have the problem of commuting to
and from the campus. To help remedy this, a Share
the-Rid<* program has arisen. As an aid to this pro
grain, Alpha Phi Omega has set up anil attempted
to maintain a "Give Lift to Village" sign at the head
of Palm Drive. However, it seems that some Village
students do not care if the sign is maintained or not—
as evidenced by the attitude of the occupants of
Building 212 (See picture on page 4 of last Tuesday's
Daily).
We believe thai a large number of Villagers find
the si*.'u helpful. Yet, if more people feel differently,
they have only (<» express their wishes, and our
project will be discontinued.
If students do desire that this sign be maintained,
we would appreciate their cooperation.
