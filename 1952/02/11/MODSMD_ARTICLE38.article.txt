### TOM NEVILLE 
Hetiing aside two hours evory Friday altemoon to hold an open
house is a job that Hon Hayes and his roommates regard as an
enjoyable experiment in international relations.
Hayes' weekly open house is known as the "Cosmopolitan
Club." 13ut "club" is the wrong word to describe this gathering of

foreign and American
since there are no dues, constitu
tion, or tixed membership.
"Anyone interested in sitting
around a lire, drinking (see coffee,
and making new friends is eligible
to join," said one regular mem
ber.
"H's completely informal," said
Hayes, describing the activities of
the group. I'.ach week new stu
dents appear (some have came
from a;; far away as Berkeley)
and the number of "regulars"
grows steadily. "We've had over
50 on some afternoons," Hayes es
timated.
The Cosmopolitan Club grew out
of an idea Hayes and his room
mates, George Selser and Bernd
Sandt, had at the beginning of hist
quarter. They had noticed that for
eign and American students at
tending Stanford too often met only
at organized panels and discussions.
"We wanted to bring everyone
together on a strictly informal
basis," Hayes said. There was to
lie no official agenda, no required
topics of discussion, and students
from all countries were to be wel
come.
As a result, Hayes and his room
mates decided to open their apart
ment (ti22 Cabrillo, on campus) ev
ery Friday from 4 to ti p.m. The first
meetings were so successful that
subsequently a regular invitation
was extended in The Daily to all
foreign and American students. It
is now an established custom for
cars to leave the Cellar at 4 p.m.
every Friday.
Hayes' apartment consists main
ly of a large room with a fireplace
at one end surrounded by couches

aixi armchairs. The club's official
mascot, a kitten named Cosmo, is
always oil hand to greet the
guests.
Favorite topics of conversation
are hard to list, one member ex
plained, hut in one afternoon they
are likely to include anything from
the Egyptian crisis to the current
basketball season. '"The main pur
pose of the club is to relax and ju£.t
taik," Hayes added.
"It's the greatest," anoiher mem
ber said. "I look forward to Fri
day afternoon all week."
