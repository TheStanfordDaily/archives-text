### DICK MALTZMAN 
Stanford's free-wheeling JV bas
ketball team came into its ovvn over
the weekendas they trounced Lin
coln High of San Francisco, 77 to 23,
and the highly touted Floyd Lowe
Realty, 58-54.
Lincoln liigh didn't show much
against the vace - horse Braves,
who proceeded to roll up one of
the most impressive, one - sided
scores in Pavilion history. Lin
coln was held to less than *ix
points per quarter in the debacle.
High point men were Jim West
phal, Howard Schwartz, Wayne
Lockhart, and Russ Lawler, each
with nine points.
The realtors, a fine AAU team
from Palo Alto, were without Byron
Van Alstyne, ex-Trojan, and Cha
valas himself, who is a regular
starter with the club. Although ex
perienced, they were no match for
the Cards in hustle.
Milt Iverson. ex-Card, kept his
team in the game in the first
quarter with nine points, ami the
Indians led at the first buzzer, IS
to 15. The Brave offense worked
to perfection in the early minutes
of the second quarter, as the ag
gressive playing of Jim Johnson,
Lockhart. and Eric Wittenberg
moved the Cards to a 36-19 lead.
Iverson and the jump shot of
"Jumping" Jack O'Sullivan, captain
of last year's Stanford varsity, again
brought the Realtors back in the
game, as they closed the gap to 36-
27 at the half-time.
Two quick buckets by Lawler and
one by Dick Carver in the opening
minutes of the third quarter moved
the Braves out to a 42-27 lead.
From here on it was all the Real
tors, who proceeded to whittle away
at the Cards' lead.
With the score 51-39, Iverson,
O'Sullivan, and crew broke

through with a 10-point spurt to j
close the gap to two points. A [
lay lip and a 10-foot set by Hob
Anderson then put Floyd Lowe's J
in the lead, 5-1-52, for (he first i
time of the game and with hut
three minutes to play.
The Braves' cold spell, which had
netted them but one point through
the first teven minutes of the fourth
quarter, broke suddenly as West
phal hit a free throw, Johnson hit
a jump shot from 10 feet out, and
Jim Caras dropped in a one-hander
and a free throw to ice the game
at 58-54.
Ivcrson was high point man
with IS, Johnson of the Braves
was close behind with 15, and
O'Sullivan was third with IJ. '
Carver, I.awler, and Lock hart
each had 10 points.
