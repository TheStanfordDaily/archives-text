TOKYO—The main Korean truce
delegations met for the fourth time
today in an effort to clear the new
est obstacle blocking the way to an
armistice — whether the proposed
"peace" conference should confine
itself to Korean problems.
Communist negotiators have made
it clear that they want other Far
Eastern problems discussed at the
conference which is to be held
within 90 days after an armistice is
signed.
The Allies, however, insist that
the conference limit itself to Ko
rean issues and not try to solve all
the problems plaguing Asia as soon
as the fighting in Korea is halted.
The Reds did give in to Allied in
sistence that the Republic of Korea
be given a seat at any peace con
ference on Korea. The vague word
ing of the original Communist prop
osition left the way open to barring
the South Koreans.
