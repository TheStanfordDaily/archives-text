# Stanfordites Explore, Map 'Unusual' Cave
## 
### PHIL HERMAN 
One of the most intricate and un
usual caves in Northern Californir
was explored on Feb. 2 and 3 by
members of the Stanford Grotto.
National Speleoloeical Society.
The cave known as "Crystal
Cave," on the Cosumnes River in
El Dorado County, was discovered
during the Gold Rush by miners,
but it has seldom been visited be
cause of the cave's maze-like struc
ture.
The Stanford party mapped all
accessible passages and rooms in
the cave. While the mapping was
lieing done, numerous specimens
of rare cave wildlife such as
white and blind flies were
collected.
With the aid of U.S. Navy-loaned
apparatus, the five-man group re
corded for the first time a system
atic record of temperature, relative
humidity, and air circulation in a
cave. When the map is drawn up,
all these data will be plotted on it.
Carrying out the survey were
mappers Bill Wise, Harry Town
send, and Glen Garrett. Gil Lang
collected the specimens, while Art
Lange took the weather readings.
Over the weekend, the Cave
Club also received some good
news. They will now have some
additional funds to cover trans
portation expenses for members
participating in expeditions. Pre
vious to this all trips had to be
financed by the members them
selves.
Largely responsible for the trans
portation fund, which now totals
close to $500, is Orley H. Truman of
Hollywood, a well-known geophys
icist, who has given valuable ad
vice and other assistance to the
grotto.
