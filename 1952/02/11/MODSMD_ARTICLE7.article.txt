BERLIN â€” The Communists in
East Germany were reported today
to be taking out of circulation be
tween 5,000,000 and 9,000,000 books
in an operation dwarfing the book
burning campaign of the Nazis.
Informants said the campaign was
designed to make it impossible for
a Soviet Zone resident to get a pro-
Western book in an Ea.st German
library, school, or book store.
