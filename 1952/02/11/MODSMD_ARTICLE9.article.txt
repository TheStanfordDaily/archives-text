# Card Cagers Beat Gaels, Then Broncs
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Stanford's basketball team
won their first weekend double
header of the season as they
downed St. Mary's 67-60 Friday
night and Santa Clara, 70-64,
Saturday night. The games were
played in the Cow Palace.
In Friday's game, the Cards had
little trouble witli the Gaels, who
boast the leading record in North
ern California independent play. St.
Mary's displayed one of the worst
shooting performances ever seen in
the Cow Palace, whereas the Cards
had their usual torrid night.
With 6-ft. 8 Ben Gibson and
guard Bob Steinkamp hitting fairly
regularly, the Gaels jumped to an
early 8-7 lead. Ed Tucker hit a
jump shot with four minutes gone
on the game, however, giving the
Cards a lead- they never relin
quished.
The first quarter ended 23-14 in
favor of Stanford, and few fans bad
any doubt about the outcome. Stan
ford had hit-on nine out of 16
shots, whereas St. Mary's could
dunk only four out of 23.
The defensive platoon of An
drews, DeLong, Johnson, Iversen,
and Zaninovich started the second
period and successfully held off
the Gaels. In the five minutes Ihey
played they scored 10 points to
(he Gaels' 10, play in# a hall-con
trol game all the while and giving
the first string a good rest.
