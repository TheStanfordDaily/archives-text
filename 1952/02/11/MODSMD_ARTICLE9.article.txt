# Card Cagers Beat Gaels, Then Broncs
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Stanford's basketball team
won their first weekend double
header of the season as they
downed St. Mary's 67-60 Friday
night and Santa Clara, 70-64,
Saturday night. The games were
played in the Cow Palace.
In Friday's game, the Cards had
little trouble witli the Gaels, who
boast the leading record in North
ern California independent play. St.
Mary's displayed one of the worst
shooting performances ever seen in
the Cow Palace, whereas the Cards
had their usual torrid night.
With 6-ft. 8 Ben Gibson and
guard Bob Steinkamp hitting fairly
regularly, the Gaels jumped to an
early 8-7 lead. Ed Tucker hit a
jump shot with four minutes gone
on the game, however, giving the
Cards a lead- they never relin
quished.
The first quarter ended 23-14 in
favor of Stanford, and few fans bad
any doubt about the outcome. Stan
ford had hit-on nine out of 16
shots, whereas St. Mary's could
dunk only four out of 23.
The defensive platoon of An
drews, DeLong, Johnson, Iversen,
and Zaninovich started the second
period and successfully held off
the Gaels. In the five minutes Ihey
played they scored 10 points to
(he Gaels' 10, play in# a hall-con
trol game all the while and giving
the first string a good rest.
The varsity then took over and
I widened the gap to 38-2G by the end
of the half. St. Mary's had hit a
sweet .143 percentage (six out of
) i 42) while the Cards kept up their
i good pace, hitting on 14 out of 29.
Although Gibson held high point
honors with 12, he suffered one
J stretch where he missed 11 consecu
j tive shots. Tucker led the Card
, | scorers with 31 points.
The second half was little more
than a repetition of (he first as the
Indians etched their lead to as
much as 17 points at one time in
the third quarter. Coach Bur
! nett inserted the defensive pla
toon at one time in the third pe
riod and again they held their
i o«vn while giving the first string a
; ret.
St. Mary's finally caught f.re in
the closing minutes of the game.
They trailed by a mere four points,
63-59, with two minutes to go. Jim
Walsh and Paul Johnson broke
through for layups, however, and
the Gaels were only able to add
one point on a free throw by Flores
making the final score 67-60.
Ben Gibson was high point man
j in the game with 20 points, but in
I mailing them he took 27 floor shots,
I hitting on seven. Ed Tucker led the
j Cards with 15.
Saturday night, the Cards had a
little tougher time sy.ainst Santa
Clara. The pattern was almo t the
same but the Humes got hot a
little earlier than the 'Gaels did.
Stanford held a 21-9 lead after
the first quarter and was out in
front 37-26 at the half. The Cards
hit a phenomenal .481 percentage
and had committed only eight per
sonal louls. In the four minutes the
defensive platoon had played they
scored five while allowing only
three.
The Broncos went on the war
path in the second half and, paced
by forward Jim Young and guard
Bob Peters, they had narrowed the
score to 40-37 in three minutes.
With two minutes remaining in the
quarter, and the score 53-49 in fa
vor of the Cards, Coach Burnett put
j in the defense but this time they
| couldn't hold the fort.
The quarter ended with the
j Cards in front 54-53 and the San
ta Clara vootcrs in a frenzy. One
minute later Santa Clara forged
ahead 56-54 and the first string
| went back in. The overall effec
| tiveness of the two-platoon sys
tem showed itself, however, as
I the well - rested first - stringers
j t n
quickly regained the lead.
Three free throws by Ed Tucker
and field goals by Ron Tomsic, Jim
Ramstead, and Jim Walsh brought
the score up to 63-56. From then
on, the game was never in doubt,
as Stanford won going-away, 70-64.
A pleasant surprise for Card
fans was the impressive showing
turned in by guard Paul Johnson.
Paul replaced Oleg Suzdaleff ear
ly in Friday's game, and started
Saturday. In the two games, he
scored 17 points, hitting on seven
of his 12 field goal attempts.

Stanford's basketball team
won their first weekend double
header of the season as they
downed St. Mary's 67-60 Friday
night and Santa Clara, 70-64,
Saturday night. The games were
played in the Cow Palace.
In Friday's game, the Cards had
little trouble witli the Gaels, who
boast the leading record in North
ern California independent play. St.
Mary's displayed one of the worst
shooting performances ever seen in
the Cow Palace, whereas the Cards
had their usual torrid night.
With 6-ft. 8 Ben Gibson and
guard Bob Steinkamp hitting fairly
regularly, the Gaels jumped to an
early 8-7 lead. Ed Tucker hit a
jump shot with four minutes gone
on the game, however, giving the
Cards a lead- they never relin
quished.
The first quarter ended 23-14 in
favor of Stanford, and few fans bad
any doubt about the outcome. Stan
ford had hit-on nine out of 16
shots, whereas St. Mary's could
dunk only four out of 23.
The defensive platoon of An
drews, DeLong, Johnson, Iversen,
and Zaninovich started the second
period and successfully held off
the Gaels. In the five minutes Ihey
played they scored 10 points to
(he Gaels' 10, play in# a hall-con
trol game all the while and giving
the first string a good rest.
The varsity then took over and
I widened the gap to 38-2G by the end
of the half. St. Mary's had hit a
sweet .143 percentage (six out of
) i 42) while the Cards kept up their
i good pace, hitting on 14 out of 29.
Although Gibson held high point
honors with 12, he suffered one
J stretch where he missed 11 consecu
j tive shots. Tucker led the Card
, | scorers with 31 points.
The second half was little more
than a repetition of (he first as the
Indians etched their lead to as
much as 17 points at one time in
the third quarter. Coach Bur
! nett inserted the defensive pla
toon at one time in the third pe
riod and again they held their
i o«vn while giving the first string a
; ret.
St. Mary's finally caught f.re in
the closing minutes of the game.
They trailed by a mere four points,
63-59, with two minutes to go. Jim
Walsh and Paul Johnson broke
through for layups, however, and
the Gaels were only able to add
one point on a free throw by Flores
making the final score 67-60.
Ben Gibson was high point man
j in the game with 20 points, but in
I mailing them he took 27 floor shots,
I hitting on seven. Ed Tucker led the
j Cards with 15.
Saturday night, the Cards had a
little tougher time sy.ainst Santa
Clara. The pattern was almo t the
same but the Humes got hot a
little earlier than the 'Gaels did.
Stanford held a 21-9 lead after
the first quarter and was out in
front 37-26 at the half. The Cards
hit a phenomenal .481 percentage
and had committed only eight per
sonal louls. In the four minutes the
defensive platoon had played they
scored five while allowing only
three.
The Broncos went on the war
path in the second half and, paced
by forward Jim Young and guard
Bob Peters, they had narrowed the
score to 40-37 in three minutes.
With two minutes remaining in the
quarter, and the score 53-49 in fa
vor of the Cards, Coach Burnett put
j in the defense but this time they
| couldn't hold the fort.
The quarter ended with the
j Cards in front 54-53 and the San

Stanford's basketball team
won their first weekend double
header of the season as they
downed St. Mary's 67-60 Friday
night and Santa Clara, 70-64,
Saturday night. The games were
played in the Cow Palace.
In Friday's game, the Cards had
little trouble witli the Gaels, who
boast the leading record in North
ern California independent play. St.
Mary's displayed one of the worst
shooting performances ever seen in
the Cow Palace, whereas the Cards
had their usual torrid night.
With 6-ft. 8 Ben Gibson and
guard Bob Steinkamp hitting fairly
regularly, the Gaels jumped to an
early 8-7 lead. Ed Tucker hit a
jump shot with four minutes gone
on the game, however, giving the
Cards a lead- they never relin
quished.
The first quarter ended 23-14 in
favor of Stanford, and few fans bad
any doubt about the outcome. Stan
ford had hit-on nine out of 16
shots, whereas St. Mary's could
dunk only four out of 23.
The defensive platoon of An
drews, DeLong, Johnson, Iversen,
and Zaninovich started the second
period and successfully held off
the Gaels. In the five minutes Ihey
played they scored 10 points to
(he Gaels' 10, play in# a hall-con
trol game all the while and giving
the first string a good rest.
The varsity then took over and
I widened the gap to 38-2G by the end
of the half. St. Mary's had hit a
sweet .143 percentage (six out of
) i 42) while the Cards kept up their
i good pace, hitting on 14 out of 29.
Although Gibson held high point
honors with 12, he suffered one
J stretch where he missed 11 consecu
j tive shots. Tucker led the Card
, | scorers with 31 points.
The second half was little more
than a repetition of (he first as the
Indians etched their lead to as
much as 17 points at one time in
the third quarter. Coach Bur
! nett inserted the defensive pla
toon at one time in the third pe
riod and again they held their
i o«vn while giving the first string a
; ret.
St. Mary's finally caught f.re in
the closing minutes of the game.
They trailed by a mere four points,
63-59, with two minutes to go. Jim
Walsh and Paul Johnson broke
through for layups, however, and
the Gaels were only able to add
one point on a free throw by Flores
making the final score 67-60.
Ben Gibson was high point man
j in the game with 20 points, but in
I mailing them he took 27 floor shots,
I hitting on seven. Ed Tucker led the
j Cards with 15.
Saturday night, the Cards had a
little tougher time sy.ainst Santa
Clara. The pattern was almo t the
same but the Humes got hot a
little earlier than the 'Gaels did.
Stanford held a 21-9 lead after
the first quarter and was out in
front 37-26 at the half. The Cards
hit a phenomenal .481 percentage
and had committed only eight per
sonal louls. In the four minutes the
defensive platoon had played they
scored five while allowing only
three.
The Broncos went on the war
path in the second half and, paced
by forward Jim Young and guard
Bob Peters, they had narrowed the
score to 40-37 in three minutes.
With two minutes remaining in the
quarter, and the score 53-49 in fa
vor of the Cards, Coach Burnett put
j in the defense but this time they
| couldn't hold the fort.
The quarter ended with the
j Cards in front 54-53 and the San
ta Clara vootcrs in a frenzy. One
minute later Santa Clara forged
ahead 56-54 and the first string
| went back in. The overall effec
| tiveness of the two-platoon sys
tem showed itself, however, as
I the well - rested first - stringers
j t n
quickly regained the lead.
Three free throws by Ed Tucker
and field goals by Ron Tomsic, Jim
Ramstead, and Jim Walsh brought
the score up to 63-56. From then
on, the game was never in doubt,
as Stanford won going-away, 70-64.
A pleasant surprise for Card
fans was the impressive showing
turned in by guard Paul Johnson.
Paul replaced Oleg Suzdaleff ear
ly in Friday's game, and started
Saturday. In the two games, he
scored 17 points, hitting on seven
of his 12 field goal attempts.

J stretch where he missed 11 consecu
j tive shots. Tucker led the Card
, | scorers with 31 points.
The second half was little more
than a repetition of (he first as the
Indians etched their lead to as
much as 17 points at one time in
the third quarter. Coach Bur
! nett inserted the defensive pla
toon at one time in the third pe
riod and again they held their
i o«vn while giving the first string a
; ret.
St. Mary's finally caught f.re in
the closing minutes of the game.
They trailed by a mere four points,
63-59, with two minutes to go. Jim
Walsh and Paul Johnson broke
through for layups, however, and
the Gaels were only able to add
one point on a free throw by Flores
making the final score 67-60.
Ben Gibson was high point man
j in the game with 20 points, but in
I mailing them he took 27 floor shots,
I hitting on seven. Ed Tucker led the
j Cards with 15.
Saturday night, the Cards had a
little tougher time sy.ainst Santa
Clara. The pattern was almo t the
same but the Humes got hot a
little earlier than the 'Gaels did.
Stanford held a 21-9 lead after
the first quarter and was out in
front 37-26 at the half. The Cards
hit a phenomenal .481 percentage
and had committed only eight per
sonal louls. In the four minutes the
defensive platoon had played they
scored five while allowing only
three.
The Broncos went on the war
path in the second half and, paced
by forward Jim Young and guard
Bob Peters, they had narrowed the
score to 40-37 in three minutes.
With two minutes remaining in the
quarter, and the score 53-49 in fa
vor of the Cards, Coach Burnett put
j in the defense but this time they
| couldn't hold the fort.
The quarter ended with the
j Cards in front 54-53 and the San
ta Clara vootcrs in a frenzy. One
minute later Santa Clara forged
ahead 56-54 and the first string
| went back in. The overall effec
| tiveness of the two-platoon sys
tem showed itself, however, as
I the well - rested first - stringers
j t n
quickly regained the lead.
Three free throws by Ed Tucker
and field goals by Ron Tomsic, Jim
Ramstead, and Jim Walsh brought
the score up to 63-56. From then
on, the game was never in doubt,
as Stanford won going-away, 70-64.
A pleasant surprise for Card
fans was the impressive showing
turned in by guard Paul Johnson.
Paul replaced Oleg Suzdaleff ear
ly in Friday's game, and started
Saturday. In the two games, he
scored 17 points, hitting on seven
of his 12 field goal attempts.

The varsity then took over and

They trailed by a mere four points,

Saturday night, the Cards had a

Stanford held a 21-9 lead after

hit a phenomenal .481 percentage
and had committed only eight per

The Broncos went on the war

Stanford's basketball team
won their first weekend double
header of the season as they
downed St. Mary's 67-60 Friday
night and Santa Clara, 70-64,
Saturday night. The games were
played in the Cow Palace.
In Friday's game, the Cards had
little trouble witli the Gaels, who
boast the leading record in North
ern California independent play. St.
Mary's displayed one of the worst
shooting performances ever seen in
the Cow Palace, whereas the Cards
had their usual torrid night.
With 6-ft. 8 Ben Gibson and
guard Bob Steinkamp hitting fairly
regularly, the Gaels jumped to an
early 8-7 lead. Ed Tucker hit a
jump shot with four minutes gone
on the game, however, giving the
Cards a lead- they never relin
quished.
The first quarter ended 23-14 in
favor of Stanford, and few fans bad
any doubt about the outcome. Stan
ford had hit-on nine out of 16
shots, whereas St. Mary's could
dunk only four out of 23.
The defensive platoon of An
drews, DeLong, Johnson, Iversen,
and Zaninovich started the second
period and successfully held off
the Gaels. In the five minutes Ihey
played they scored 10 points to
(he Gaels' 10, play in# a hall-con
trol game all the while and giving
the first string a good rest.
The varsity then took over and
I widened the gap to 38-2G by the end
of the half. St. Mary's had hit a
sweet .143 percentage (six out of
) i 42) while the Cards kept up their
i good pace, hitting on 14 out of 29.
Although Gibson held high point
honors with 12, he suffered one
J stretch where he missed 11 consecu
