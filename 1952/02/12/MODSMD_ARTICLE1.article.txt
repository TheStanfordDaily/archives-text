LONDON, Feb. II (HP) — Tlie
body of King George lay in state in
historic Westminster Hall tonight
after more than a million of his
subjects had gathered in rain and
cold to pay him the tribute of a
grieving empire.
The sovereign was brought to
London from Sandringham, where
he died last Wednesday. Ilis coffin
was drawn slowly through the city
on the same gun carriage that bore
the body of his father, George V,
16 years ago.
Along the three miles from King's
Cross station to Westminster Hall,
mourners massed in the freezing
mists of a midwinter day from five
to 25 deep.
Tonight the coffin rested on a
purple-draped catafalque over the
same spot where his father lay in
state while the first of hundreds of
thousands of mourners began to
pass through the ancient hall.
Members of Parliament and their
wives and certain court ami govern
ment officials w«re the first to enter
the softly lighted great oaken vault
whose beamed ceiling is one of the
glories of medieval architecture.
At Sandringham, the "home"
which the king left for the last time,
his neighbors thronged the three
mile stretch of winding road from
the royal house to tiny Wolferton
station.
