# Jet Ace Is Downed
## 
### 
TOKYO, Tuesday, Feb. 12—Maj.
George A. Davis Jr., world's fore
most jet ace who downed 14 Com
munist planes in Korea, was shot
down Sunday—but he sent two last
Red MlG's blazing to earth before
he went.
An Air Force announcement to
day said the 31-year-old Lubbock,
Tex., flyer is officially listed as
missing in action. No one saw him
parachute from his crippled F-Bfi
Sabrejet and little hope was held
out that he had survived.
