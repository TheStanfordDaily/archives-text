# Birkmeyer Will Speak on Art
## 
### 
Karl M. Birkmeyer of the Art De
partment will speak on "Dadaism,
Surrealim, and So On" at the second
Intermezzo program tomorrow at
3:30 p.m. in the Bender Room of
the Main Library.
The program, which is open to
students and faculty members, is to
present a series of talks "that, per
haps, will make Stanford people
drop their books for a while, forget,
their required reading for an hour
or so, and just listen to some good
talking about books, music, art, and
maybe ask some questions."
The final talk of the series will be
given by Dr. William Crosten, head
of the Music Department, who will
speak on "Then There Is Music."
Coffee will be served after the
talks.
