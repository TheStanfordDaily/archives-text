# 'Let the Winds of Freedom Blow'
## 
### 
"Lei the Winds of Freedom Elow." With this
slogan the all-campus foreign student relief
drive qoes into high qear for the biq push this
week.
The drive, one of the best orqanized we can
remember, lacks the dramatic appeal some past
drives have had. We're inclined to take for
qranted what we have, and find it difficult some
times to realize that educational conditions
across the oceans aren't quite what they are
here.
Students are more willing to contribute to
something more tangible—a pint ot blood that
might save a life, or dollars to the Red Cross,
whose story of healing in dramatic situations is
a familiar one.
In a real sense, contributions to foreign
student relief can save lives. Not as dramatic
ally perhaps, but just as effectively. Contri
butions will go for medicine, food, clothing,
housing, and educational facilities, desper
ately needed at several foreign universities.
These are minimum essentials for a whole
some life, tree from want.
Some 700 students, actively workinq on the

drive, are convinced the need is qreat. Of this
number, over 600 are enqaqed in solicitinq,
more than for any past drive.
Perhaps realizing U.S. students aren't con
ditioned to identify themselves with difficulties
laced by foreiqn students, this year's Drives
Committee has compensated by a lot of qood,
hard work. And it has come up with a gimmick,
a minor stroke of genius, that has undoubtedly
helped contributions along, and has resulted,
incidentally, in a lot of qood publicity for the
University.
The gimmick, o/ course, is faculty hashers
for the living groups that contribute most per
capita. Foreign relief aside, most students aie
going to chip in their bucks to be able to say,
"Hey, Winbigler, how about seconds?"
The dean is only one of many faculty mem
bers who has offered his hashing services.
Contrary to most past drives .the policy this
year is to meet no quota, no certuhi amount per
student, no goal. It's a matter of giving what
you can and what you want to give.
Looks from here like a good practical way
to "Help the Winds of Freedom blow."

number, over 600 are enqaqed in solicitinq,
more than for any past drive.
Perhaps realizing U.S. students aren't con
ditioned to identify themselves with difficulties
laced by foreiqn students, this year's Drives
Committee has compensated by a lot of qood,
hard work. And it has come up with a gimmick,
a minor stroke of genius, that has undoubtedly
helped contributions along, and has resulted,
incidentally, in a lot of qood publicity for the
University.
The gimmick, o/ course, is faculty hashers
for the living groups that contribute most per
capita. Foreign relief aside, most students aie
going to chip in their bucks to be able to say,
"Hey, Winbigler, how about seconds?"
The dean is only one of many faculty mem
bers who has offered his hashing services.
Contrary to most past drives .the policy this
year is to meet no quota, no certuhi amount per
student, no goal. It's a matter of giving what
you can and what you want to give.
Looks from here like a good practical way
to "Help the Winds of Freedom blow."
"Lei the Winds of Freedom Elow." With this
slogan the all-campus foreign student relief
drive qoes into high qear for the biq push this
week.
The drive, one of the best orqanized we can
remember, lacks the dramatic appeal some past
drives have had. We're inclined to take for
qranted what we have, and find it difficult some
times to realize that educational conditions
across the oceans aren't quite what they are
here.
Students are more willing to contribute to
something more tangible—a pint ot blood that
might save a life, or dollars to the Red Cross,
whose story of healing in dramatic situations is
a familiar one.
In a real sense, contributions to foreign
student relief can save lives. Not as dramatic
ally perhaps, but just as effectively. Contri
butions will go for medicine, food, clothing,
housing, and educational facilities, desper
ately needed at several foreign universities.
These are minimum essentials for a whole
some life, tree from want.
Some 700 students, actively workinq on the

drive, are convinced the need is qreat. Of this
number, over 600 are enqaqed in solicitinq,
more than for any past drive.
