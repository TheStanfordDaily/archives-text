### PETE GROTHE 
OF BUGS AND CATHEDRAL WINDOWS
God in his wisdom made the fly
And then forgot to tell us why.
—Ogden Nash
Many of you will be taking long car trips to the
snow country this winter. And I submit that the
boredom of long drives will be alleviated if you only
take cognizance of the bugs that splatter against your
front windows.
Does thin sound puzzling? If so, bore a hole in your
head and listen with an open mind. I shall exnlain.

Now, when I say observe • the
bugs that splatter against the
window, I do not mean this from
a scientific point of view. I mean
this from an artistic point of view.
I am no entomologist. In fact, I
feel very well disposed to tlie
gentlemen in the biology depart
ment for giving me "C's" in bio
1, 2 ; and 3. The only thing 1 can
recall about bugs in my bio course
is that we had to pull fruit flies

cut of paper bags and determine their sex. All of
which seems a little ridiculous to me, for there ap
pears to be little difference between a male and a
female. I can think of nothing that enthuses me less
than to peer through a magnifying glass at a female
fruit fly. And from what I can gather, the male fruit
flies are no more enthused than I am.
Ah, but a bug getting plastered against the window
pane. This is a different matter.
I am a paid up member of the S.P.C.A, and yet
I get an aesthetic pleasure from watching a minute
hug appear in the distance, get larger and larger
as the car shoots to it, and then meet an untimely
end by squashing its viscera against the window.
This is even more spectacular at night when a juicy
moth or a multicolored butterfly appears in the head
lights. In less time than it takes to say "daddy long
legs," gleeful motorists are inspecting the illuminated
squash of what once was a healthy bug.

As you may have gathered by now, I am a hater
of bugs from way back, and it is my hope that the
S.P.C.A does not court-martial me for this.
This sport is even more entertaining when you
drive across the country. Last summer, another boy
and I motored across the U.S., and the bug innards
that presented themselves for inspection on our ear
window varied with each geographical section. The
appendages were longer and more muscular in the
midwesterh farm country from strenuous work on
the corn and wheat. The enchantment of the Old
South was reflected in the glowing gore of the light
ning bugs; and there was a distinct touch of blue in
the blood of insects that made their home on Boston's
stately Beacon Hill.
A word of warning is in order, however. The hugs
must be cleaned off the windows at regular inter
vals. Otherwise, the sight may become unappealing.
I had to learn the hard way. On our summer trip,
my friend and I had vowed that the right front
window should be untouched by a gas station at
tendant's rag. We wanted to let the bugs collect so
that the window would give the reverent appear
ance of a stained glass window of a great cathedral.
What with the various greens, yellows, reds, and
blues collecting, the pane would he a symphony of
colors.
Alter a week of our experiment, we werp eating
dinner in our car at a drive-in in South Dakota. It
was at this time that a stark reality hit us: The
pane did not look like a stained glass window of a
great cathedral, but rather just what it was —dead
bugs on glass. And it occurred to me at the time that
I had heard of chicken under glass and ioast pig
under glass, but never bugs under glass. And I
found that the hamburger that T was trying to de
vour was becoming less and less appetizing.
It's great artistic sport watching bugs besmatter
themselves against the window. Try it.
But be sure to clean them off, especially if you
happen to be eating hamburgers at drive-ins in South
Dakota.

front windows.
Does thin sound puzzling? If so, bore a hole in your
head and listen with an open mind. I shall exnlain.

Now, when I say observe • the
bugs that splatter against the
window, I do not mean this from
a scientific point of view. I mean
this from an artistic point of view.
I am no entomologist. In fact, I
feel very well disposed to tlie
gentlemen in the biology depart
ment for giving me "C's" in bio
1, 2 ; and 3. The only thing 1 can
recall about bugs in my bio course
is that we had to pull fruit flies

cut of paper bags and determine their sex. All of
which seems a little ridiculous to me, for there ap
pears to be little difference between a male and a
female. I can think of nothing that enthuses me less
than to peer through a magnifying glass at a female
fruit fly. And from what I can gather, the male fruit
flies are no more enthused than I am.
Ah, but a bug getting plastered against the window
pane. This is a different matter.
I am a paid up member of the S.P.C.A, and yet
I get an aesthetic pleasure from watching a minute
hug appear in the distance, get larger and larger
as the car shoots to it, and then meet an untimely
end by squashing its viscera against the window.
This is even more spectacular at night when a juicy
moth or a multicolored butterfly appears in the head
lights. In less time than it takes to say "daddy long
legs," gleeful motorists are inspecting the illuminated
squash of what once was a healthy bug.

As you may have gathered by now, I am a hater
of bugs from way back, and it is my hope that the
S.P.C.A does not court-martial me for this.
This sport is even more entertaining when you
drive across the country. Last summer, another boy
and I motored across the U.S., and the bug innards
that presented themselves for inspection on our ear
window varied with each geographical section. The
appendages were longer and more muscular in the
midwesterh farm country from strenuous work on
the corn and wheat. The enchantment of the Old
South was reflected in the glowing gore of the light
ning bugs; and there was a distinct touch of blue in
the blood of insects that made their home on Boston's
stately Beacon Hill.
A word of warning is in order, however. The hugs
must be cleaned off the windows at regular inter
vals. Otherwise, the sight may become unappealing.
I had to learn the hard way. On our summer trip,
my friend and I had vowed that the right front
window should be untouched by a gas station at
tendant's rag. We wanted to let the bugs collect so
that the window would give the reverent appear
ance of a stained glass window of a great cathedral.
What with the various greens, yellows, reds, and
blues collecting, the pane would he a symphony of
colors.
Alter a week of our experiment, we werp eating
dinner in our car at a drive-in in South Dakota. It
was at this time that a stark reality hit us: The
pane did not look like a stained glass window of a
great cathedral, but rather just what it was —dead
bugs on glass. And it occurred to me at the time that
I had heard of chicken under glass and ioast pig
under glass, but never bugs under glass. And I
found that the hamburger that T was trying to de
vour was becoming less and less appetizing.
It's great artistic sport watching bugs besmatter
themselves against the window. Try it.
But be sure to clean them off, especially if you
happen to be eating hamburgers at drive-ins in South
Dakota.
