# EXCHANGE SCHOLARSHIP LETTER
## Police Keep Paris Life Calm

d'Etude Politique in Paris,)
November 21 was quite a day here for foreigners.
Adenauer was here in town for talks with French,
British, and American officials over German rearma
ment, and the Communists were not going to take it
calmly. The town was plastered with anti-German,
anti-Adenauer signs. A huge rally-riot was to be
staged on the Champs-Elysees, between the Rond-
Point and the George V cafe at six o'clock in the
evening. At five thirty I came up out of the M£tro
onto the Champs-Elys£es, blissful in my ignorance.
I had never seen so many police in my life. About
fifty at the M6tro exit, and standing a few feet apart
all up and down the street. The side streets were
filled with Black Marias, each with its quota of ten
or fifteen policemen. I walked home as calmly as
possible, but more than a little curious. On the radio
the broadcaster warned people to stay in their homes,
as shooting might occur!
This was the last I heard of the business till nine
that night; I went past there in the bus, and the place
was still well-equipped and staffed by John Uw, but
was quiet. It turned out that the riot was a fizzle. To
begin with it rained, enough to dampen any malcon
tent's spirit. In addition, it would be a brave soul to
face what seemed like half the Paris police force. A
small group did gather; they were all arrested, and
the foreigners caught among them v/ere deported.
Between six and seven, all identity cards in the area
were checked as a security precaution. What promised
to be exciting business fortunately turned out other
wise.

r*ast Sunday, the second of December, like pre
cautions were taken when members of United Na
tions forces fighting in Korea marched down the

Champs-Elysees and had a ceremony in front of the
Arc de Triornphe; all was very quiet.
Although I have not seen it myself, I have been
told that the Communists are taking their wrath out
on individuals. The most recent and specific case 1
know of occurred two Sundays ago. A young and
very small RAF pilot was chased about four blocks
down the Champs-Elysees by a crowd of 15 or 20;
two tall American MP's loomed up on the scene and
promptly saved him!
At first glance much of the public dislike is
directed exclusively against Americans; on second
look, though, I think it's anti-foreign in general.
The tilings I've heard said about Churchill, espe
cially around election time! And I've often heard
"Down with the Americans, British, and Russians"
—lumping us ail together! In spite of these re
marks, life is in reality very calm and safe; with
the police force around here one would have a
hard time getting into much trouble.
One of the most interesting episodes ot my stay so
far was the Armistice Day weekend. I went to Sen
lis, a cathedral town about 38 miles from here. The
distance is deceptive; for all of the influence of Paris,
it could have been a thousand miles in the other
direction. The town is quiet, rich with age, set in
the midst of a prosperous agricultural region. There
are many, many old buildings there, and they even
have the remains of Roman baths!
The Sunday I was there the cathedral was cele
brating the 760 th anniversary of its dedication. The
town has two historical associations: Joan of Arc de
feated the Duke of Bedford nearby, and Marechal
Foch had his headquarters there on Nov. 11, 1918,
when he drove to Compiegne to sign the Armistice.
The three days spent there wcie an interesting
glimpse into French countiy life—totally different
from that of Paris.

I had never seen so many police in my life. About
fifty at the M6tro exit, and standing a few feet apart
all up and down the street. The side streets were
filled with Black Marias, each with its quota of ten
or fifteen policemen. I walked home as calmly as
possible, but more than a little curious. On the radio
the broadcaster warned people to stay in their homes,
as shooting might occur!
This was the last I heard of the business till nine
that night; I went past there in the bus, and the place
was still well-equipped and staffed by John Uw, but
was quiet. It turned out that the riot was a fizzle. To
begin with it rained, enough to dampen any malcon
tent's spirit. In addition, it would be a brave soul to
face what seemed like half the Paris police force. A
small group did gather; they were all arrested, and
the foreigners caught among them v/ere deported.
Between six and seven, all identity cards in the area
were checked as a security precaution. What promised
to be exciting business fortunately turned out other
wise.

r*ast Sunday, the second of December, like pre
cautions were taken when members of United Na
tions forces fighting in Korea marched down the

Champs-Elysees and had a ceremony in front of the
Arc de Triornphe; all was very quiet.
Although I have not seen it myself, I have been
told that the Communists are taking their wrath out
on individuals. The most recent and specific case 1
know of occurred two Sundays ago. A young and
very small RAF pilot was chased about four blocks
down the Champs-Elysees by a crowd of 15 or 20;
two tall American MP's loomed up on the scene and
promptly saved him!
At first glance much of the public dislike is
directed exclusively against Americans; on second
look, though, I think it's anti-foreign in general.
The tilings I've heard said about Churchill, espe
cially around election time! And I've often heard
"Down with the Americans, British, and Russians"
—lumping us ail together! In spite of these re
marks, life is in reality very calm and safe; with
the police force around here one would have a
hard time getting into much trouble.
One of the most interesting episodes ot my stay so
far was the Armistice Day weekend. I went to Sen
lis, a cathedral town about 38 miles from here. The
distance is deceptive; for all of the influence of Paris,
it could have been a thousand miles in the other
direction. The town is quiet, rich with age, set in
the midst of a prosperous agricultural region. There
are many, many old buildings there, and they even
have the remains of Roman baths!
The Sunday I was there the cathedral was cele
brating the 760 th anniversary of its dedication. The
town has two historical associations: Joan of Arc de
feated the Duke of Bedford nearby, and Marechal
Foch had his headquarters there on Nov. 11, 1918,
when he drove to Compiegne to sign the Armistice.
The three days spent there wcie an interesting
glimpse into French countiy life—totally different
from that of Paris.
