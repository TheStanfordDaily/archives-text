### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
When the* basketball season rolls around, one of the most popular cam
pus sports is referee-baiting. Sometimes the feeling is thj>t the men in
:â€¢ tripes call what isn't there, but when the rougher PCC Southern Division
teams vi.sit the Pavilion, the opinion is quite different.
LEITH AND STRINGER CRITICIZED
In recent years, Card fans have I een raising a legitimate heef (hat
the refs haven't called enough. Most of these attacks have been directed
against two men in particular, Lloyd Lehh and Lou Stringer. Stringer,
no longer a referee, used to travel with the I'CLA squad and many times
he was accused of overlooking some ol the more flagrant violations of
the rules.
Leith, a Bay Area official, also displays at times a tendency to forgive
fomo ol the roughness in the game. Not so long ago, the Pavilion used to
resound with the howls of angry Card rooters, infuriated over Leith's fail
ure to take notice of some of the more obvious violations, especially when
the southern teams came. Card fans would leave the games muttering in
disbelief over the antics of such notorious offenders as Stan Christie of USC
and Karl Kraushaar of the Bruins.
A memorable phase of the L.I.U-Cal game last year, won by Cal, was
the unbelievable frequency of foulim* Sherm White had to endure before
Leith would agree to call a foul. The Easterners were shocked, having been
used to a cleaner brand ol basketball. Incidentally L.I U holds the Cow
Palace record of eight personal fouls in a game, the fewest ever.
These referees, however, are only human. They call the fouls as they
set* them and although their opinions may differ from ours, the integrity
of these men is seldom qustioned.
EASTERN REEEING DIFFERENT
In th East, however, Madison Square Garden to be exact, the ability of
the officials isn't questioned as much as the integrity. The feeling among
Now York basketball fans, a feeling wholly justified, is that the Garden
refs deliberate make' it tougher for the out-of-town teams that play there.
In this way they not only bolster the records <d' the New York teams, but
they help insure better gates at the Garden.
The metropolitan fans are led to believe that in the New York teams they
are seeing the best brand of basketball in the country. When one of those
teams unwisely decides to make a trip, the results are disappointing.
Last year L.I.U. boasted one of the hottest teams in the country. In
the Garden they were unstopable as they amassed a record of 16 wins
against no defeats. Then they went on the road. They were knocked off
by Cal, Arizona, St. Louis, and Kansas State in rapid-fire order and New
York fans were a trifle disillusioned.
Earlier in this season, St. John's was reported to have one of the truly
great teams. On their first trip out of the Garden, they were beaten by
Kentucky, a three point favorite, 81-40.
When St. John's returned to the Garden, they were still drawing w< 11,
but their lustre had somewhat dimmed. Their first eflort after the Kentucky
massacre saw them beat Vanderbilt, 69-54. Then on Dec. 27 Utah came to
the Garden to play St. John's.
Tlie game was fairly even for the first few minutes. Utah's 6'5" center
Kent Bates hiked extremely fine, as he was completely out-playing St.
John's All-American center Boh Zawoluk. Within three minutes, how
ever, referees John Nucatola and Matty Begovich had called three fouls
mi Bates. Nobody was able to figure out what infractions he had com
mitted, hut no fuss was made.
Bates was taken out of the game and returned later in the quarter. In
the first, minute he was in he got another foul called on him. Again the
usually impartial New York fans could see no reason for the call and they
let the refs know it. Bates was again taken out, and he didn't return until
midway in the second half. Meanwhile St. John's was slowly but surely
widening the gap. When Bates returned, he promptly was hit with another
personal, thus retiring him from the game. The Garden was in an uproar,
and Nucatola and Begovich were lucky they escaped unscathed. St. John's
won GG-57.
MEINECKE HALTED
Two days later, a favored Dayton team came to the Garden to play
St. John's. In G'7" Don Meineeke, Dayton had one of the outstanding centers
in the country, third highest nationally in 1951.
Referees Sam Schoenfeld and Stan Stutz, needless to say, called three
fouls on Meineeke in the first six minutes of play. The Garden fans,
started to smell something fishy, roared their disapproval immediately,
'{'lie game finally ended 62-60 in favor of St. John's.
Meineeke had played a total of eleven minutes before he fouled out
on fouls nobody in the Garden but Schoenfeld and Stutz were able to see.
New York basketball fans were ashamed to look at each other, and the
opinion ol Garden refs fell 100 per cent.
