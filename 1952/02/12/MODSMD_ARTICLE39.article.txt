# El Toro, Theta Chi Roll
## 
### 
Sparked by Larry Cahn, the El
Toro basketballers squeaked (on
20-18 victory over the Breakers in
intramural play last night.
Though the Toros gained their
Ipad late in the second half, the con
test was close most of the way. The
half-time score was 14-12, the
Breakers trailing.
Cahn, a Daiiy sportswriter, led
the scoring for the winners, tank
ing eight points. Bob Wilcox of the
Breakers tallied eight points also,

| but it was not enough to stop the
j Toros.
Ted Cannis of the winners also
wa a high scorer, tanking six points
in completing four out of five free
throws. Lack of accuracy on the
charity tosses was the principal
downfall of the Breakers. They
tanked only four out of 14 attempts.
In other mural contests, the Theta
Chi hoopsters trounced the Theta
Xi five, 42-13. The winners went
ahead early in the game and were
never headed.
