# Senator Knowland Outlines Firm Asia Policy
## 
### HADLEY ROFF 
William Knowland, the big,
broad - shouldered senior Sena
tor from California, returned late
last week from Washington and
immediately began stumping
the state, urging his constituents
to back his "get tough" policy
against "international Commu
nism."
In an interview with The Daily
Saturday the Senator explained in
grim terms how he'd eall the sig
nals in Cold War negotiations.
Pointing to the stick-in-hand pol
icy of gruff Theodore Roosevelt,
Knowland said that America must
regain the moral determination of
50 years ago.
Outlining a two - step policy,
the Senator said first that Amer
ica inn t renounce the Yalta
Agreement, which lie branded

"immoral." "Entered into with
out the consent of the Senate, the
agreement has 110 legal founda
tion and should Im? renounced by
the nation," Knowland stated.
Claiming that the nation lost the
world's moral leadership at Yalta,
Knowland urged that Americans
never again permit the entrance of
the country into a secret interna
tional compromise.
"Such secret deals arc a revoca
tion of all that democracy stands
for," Knowland emphasized.
The deep-voiced California Re
publican also warned the nation
against entering compromise agree
ments with the Reds. "You can't
compromise with Communism," he
claimed. "The only term Reds un
derstand,' he declared, "is that ol
force."
Force would be the second step
in Knowland's policy for the re
claiming of mitral leadership. "Get
tough," lie said as he warned that

compromise only works for Com- I
inunist advantage.
"Look at Korea—UN forces are ]
fighting with hands tied."
"How can our men lie expected to j
fight and die when they can't touch
the bases supplying Red troops with
the weapons of war?" he asked.
Urging thai America immediately I
undertake direct punitive fiction
against China proper, the Senator
demanded that the administration
wipe away restrictions on bombing
Manchuria. Knowhind said that
such "positive action is the only
way to gain an honorable Korean
peace."
Knowland, long a supporter of the
Nationalist regime of China, fur
ther advocated the arming of Na
tionalist forces on Formosa and aid
ing them in carrying on commando- j

like raids along the China coast.
Advising that Nationalist forces
have not the strength to hurl a

; full - scale invasion against the
mainland, Knowland said the
coastal raids would prove effec
tive and would reduce Red Chi
ne c pressure on the Allied lines
| in Korea.
When asked about rumors of Na
tionalist corruption, Knowland said
that when he vi: ited Formosa last
November, lie found most of the
officials alert and honest.
Another "get tough" move neces
sary in Asia, according to Know
land, is the ringing of China's coast
by a trigger-tense American fleet,
j Knowhind demands that the fleet
I prowl Asian waters with an eye to
j stopping all trade.
Claiming that manv nations, in-
I eluding Great Hritain, still carry
011 trade with China, Knowland
a ked that an iron-walled hlock

ade be strung along the coast "so
that not a gallon of gasoline can
seep to the Kcds."
Knowland also asked that our
State Department take to task any
nation that insists on trading with
China.
Any of the Atlantic Pact nations
that continue their China trade
should be stripped of all United
States aid, the Senator insisted.
When asked what reaction he ex
pects from Russia if the United
States adopts his plan of direct
China attack, Knowland said that
"the Kremlin most likely wouldn't
do a thing."
He based this opinion on Russia's
past reluctance to commit Russian
troops into actual "Cold War"
battle.
He admitted, however, that on
final analysis Russia's plans are a
matter of guesswoik and that any
aggressive action on the part of the
United States would be a "calcu
lated risk."
In Europe the Senator's plans
were far less concrete as he said
the United States should continue

to strengthen collective security
through the North Atlantic Pact. He
shrugged oil any comment 011 any
plan for direct action against Eu
rope's Communist nations.
