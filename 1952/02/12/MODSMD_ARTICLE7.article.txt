# German Schools Need Aid

(Editor's Note: This is (he last part of a Jan. 30,
JWS2, letter from I'liil Nielsen, Stanford exchange
scholar to Hie Free University of Berlin. In the
letter Nielsen comments 011 the Oflicc «>f All-Ger
man Student Affairs, which will pet 15 per cent of
the receipts from the current Relief Drive. The pic
ture above was also sent by Nielsen.)
Sometime ago I saw the outstanding letter written
by the ASSU to the Amt fur Gesamtdeutsche Studen
tenfragen (Office of All-German Student Affairs)
voicing whole-hearted support and sympathy for the
work of the Amt. I think the letter and what it
symbolizes to the people over here is an unusually
fine and inspiring expression of your goodwill and
the Stanford spirit. It appeared in one of Germany's
leading papers, Die Neue Zeitung, and was also broad
east over the powerful West Berlin radio station,
RIAS.
Having seen for myself the terrible risks run L.y
those on both sides of the Iron Curtain in Germany

who seek freedom of thought and action arid who
resist oppression and control with all they have, I
believe you could not have chosen more worth while
or more valuable agencies than the Free University
and the Amt as recipients of a part of the Winter
Quarter Drive funds. Every cent you send to Berlin
will, I assure you, show these people that you are
solidly behind them materially and spiritually and
will advance the efforts and hopes of those who arc
fighting to keep alive the basic human dignities and
right to a self-determined chance in life that are deep
in the soul and aspirations of us all. When you give,
try to think of yourself in the position of a person
in Berlin who would be helped by your aid and you
will surely realize that you would thereby gain re
newed faith and the necessary material support to
push on toward freedom.
My best wishes and hopes to you all.
Yours truly,
PHIL NIELSEN


IN GERMANY—SeveraI students spend the night in a Free University classroom, awaiting last
summer's thwarted attack in which Soviet-inspired East Berliners tried to burn down the Univer
sity.
