# HOPES HIGH
## Tuesday Evening Speaker Is Former Time Writer 
### 
John Scott, former correspondent for Time Inc., hat. experienced
many years in Russia and the Balkans—years that gave him in
sight into the problem of "The Press and the Cold War," which he
will discuss at tonight's Tuesday Evening Series lecture.
The talk will begin at 7:30 in Memorial Auditorium. Scott will

be introduced by Dr. Anatole G.
Mazour, associate professor of his
tory. The public is invited without
charge.
Leaving collcge early in the de
pression years, Scott decided to
travel and work abroad where job
opportunities might be better. After
a few months of intensive study at
a General Electric training school

in Schenectady, N.Y., where he
earned a metal worker's certificate,
he sailed for Russia. He began
learning the language and worked
for five years in industrial plants
there.
The great purge of 1037 expelled
him along with thousands of other
foreigners from Soviet industry.
"Beyond the Urals," the story of
Scott's life in these Siberian steel
mills and chemical plants, is hi.s first
hook, published in 1042 after his
return to the United States. Shortly
afterward two other books, "Duel
for Europe" and "Europe in Revo
lution," were published.
When lie was no longer allowed lo
work in Russian industry, he stayed
on in Moscow for three years as a
correspondent for Havas, the French
news agency, and later for the Lon
don News Chronicle. His knowledge
of the language and the country
helped Scott rapidly to become well
known as a foreign correspondent.
In ID4O and 1941 Scoff made two
long frips through the Balkans, the
Middle East, and Asiatic Russia
writing reports which attracted at
tention in many countries. Two
weeks before the German attack
against the USSR the Soviet au

thorities expelled Scott from the
country for slandering Soviet for
eiijn policy and "inventing" reports
of Soviet-« German friction. At this
time he left the country for good
and went to Japan. He joined the
staff of 'lime shortly afterward.
