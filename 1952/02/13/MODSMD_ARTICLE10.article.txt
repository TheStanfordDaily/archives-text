tumn quarter by Bud McCord, one
of the editors.
McCord realized the need fot a
campus literary magazine at Stan
ford and the result is Viewpoint,
designed to serve as an outlet for
student literary talents and student
analysis of controversial matters.

however. Alter ideas and plans had

valuable information and advice
from former Stanford Literary
Magazine editors Pawl C. Ed
wards, president of the Board of
Trustees, and Margery Bailey, as
sociate professor of English, who
were editors of the "Sequoia."

j publish the first issue. Mrs. Don
ald B. Tresiddcr, wife of a former
Stanford president, donated $100 to
help get the project under way. The
rest of the funds have come from an
anonymous source.
When Ihe magazine was first pub
licized, students began to send in
articles, poems, and stories. Many
| stories were obtained from the Uni
versity's creative writing depart
ment as well as from volunteers.
The Literary Association appoint
ed four associate editors for the
magazine: William McCord, Joan
• McSord, Harold Hogers, and Peter
Emmet. Tom Johnson is art editor
and Sam Freshman, business mana
ger.
