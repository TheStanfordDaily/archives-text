### DICK McLEAN 
WHAT TO DO WHEN YOTJ CO SKIING
First, write a bogus check in some place where
you're not kno vn. Writ** il for at least a hundred
dollars bui no more. (On the other side of a hun
dred rt becomes grand larceny.) Any amount short
of this figure will only get you as far as Donner Pass
or the toll gate at Yosemite. With the rubber check
already cashed and the towel around your license
plates drive down to Smith's on the Circle. Get the
works: skis, poles, racks, goggles, zinc ointment, boots,
parkas, and snow medicine.
It must be remembered that it's extremely cold in
the snow regions and the human body is not made
tor the near zero temperatures. Thus we have the
need of snow medicine. (The principle is the same

as the anti-freeze you put in your
radiators.) Now there are several
varieties of snow medicine and
the choice of the proper one is
important. If the temperature is
going to drop under five degrees
below, use the special Russian
liquid. For temper atures between
iero and freezing many ski ex
perts recommend a new medicine
which is manufactured in Ken
tucky This life saver is carmel

colored and fire-flavored. For a general utility pana
cea the Scotch have their own remedy. This wonder
ful fluid not only wards off snow Sickness but works
fine in a low gas tank or an empty cigarette lighter.
The iodine in this Scotch miracle drug is also affective
for minor cuts and abrasions. (I might add that
though their principles are the same, ami-freeze
isn't advisable. It causes what is called snow blind
ness.)
After the choice of the proper snow medicine, buzz
the campus once before you leave. Honk to ail your
friends. Stop by the rest home and the hospital to
say "goodbye" to those who went skiing the week
before. The best time to leave campus is early Friday
morning when most people are staggering down Quad
to take a mid-term. It'll give those poor unfortunates
a lift to know that someone is having fun. They're
only kidding when they shout, "Drop dead, you econ
majors."
When ycu get up to the snow country, unpack

everything but the ski';. Leave them on your rar.
Permanently. This is the whole trick of a success
ful snow trek. DON"! SKI. Everyone knows that
skiing is far too dangerous unless you are an ex
pert. The lure of the slick slopes is a Siren calling
to (he unwary. The fast white snow says, "Vou're
doing fine, young Hier, Climb higher. faster.
You're doing line, Go all the way to the top now."
The wise are humble and stay on the bunny hills;
but the proud . . . Perhaps you've seen a few on
crutches wearing those oversized plaster shoes.
There are enough great things to do without putting
your feet into the bindings and playing "chase the
boards" down the hill. You can toboggan or have
snow fights or build snow men or ice skate or play
Dr. Curie and look lor the perfect snow medicine
combination.
Another important enterprise of any good snow
trip is the manufacture of some really good snow
time stories. There are any number of good ones
but here are a few old lavontes.
"There 1 was at 5,000 feet whipping down the hill
at a mile a minute when my lei l ski came loose,
1 could have stem christied on the other ski but
there wasn't time. The ice crevass was too close. So
1 squatted low and gave a tremendous lunge . .
(The end ol this story depends on the age of your
audience and your po; t ski trip condition )
"From the bottom of (he ski jump it didn't look
too high So 1 took Hie dare and climbed the thou
sand steps to the lop. The wind was blowing pretty
hard so I had to aim myself over the crowd to hit
ihe slope, I wasn't really scared. 'If I don't make
it, 1 won't have to worry about Hie mid-term Mon
day,' I said philosophically."
"So then this lovely dolly says to me, 'Well, what
do you do in the evenings after skiing, birdrnan? . .
Pick yourself out a phoney name for the check,
decide on your brand ol snow medicine, and fabri
cate a few good stories. The snow is piied high and
the lure of the cold slopes blows down lrom the
north, Who knows? If you're extremely lucky, you
might even be snowed-in.

1 got an early look 3t the new literary magazine
"Viewpoint." It looks pretty good, If you can scrape
the loot together, you might give this new enterprise
a hand by buying a copy tomorrow morning.
