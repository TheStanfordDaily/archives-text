# More on Prejudice

To the Editor:
It is certainly admirable of Mr. Skip living to de
plore bigotry -but his scathing and insulting remarks,
spat upon one whose method of combating prejudice
does not happen to conform with Mr. living's own—
leads one to wonder juct how free of bigotry Mr.
Irving actually is. Surely there is room in this world
for the anti-prejudice injunctions of Mr. Grothe, how
ever sophomoric they might appear to Mr. Irving.
What would you have us do, Mr. Irving? Lynch Mr.
Crothe? Or just hate him?
It is to be admitted that most of us are bigoted—
at least we can believe so if we accept Mr. li ving's
criteria, for he tells us that Mr. Grothe is bigoted,
since his incredibly prejudiced eye tells him that
there is a difference of color between a Negro and a
white. How do we get to this marvelous state, Mr.
Irving, when we can no longer differentiate between
colors?
