## 'Island' Economy in Berlin 
### 
(Editoi's Note: Phil Nielsen, Stanford Exchange
Student to the Free University of Berlin, tells of
tconomir problems in the German city, in the fol
lowing poitiori of a letter he wrote to the Stanford
student body Der. 29.)
Craning my neck out the window of the American
military train leaving Berlin for West Germany
through the Russian Zone, I slowly waved good-bye
to my lonely German friend standing on the platform
now receding rapidly into the cold and palpable win
ter fog. A spirited Bing Crosby recording of "Jingle
Bells" was gradually choked off by the heavy, swirl
ing fog, and then drowned completely by the power
ful i bugging of the engine.
This scene might well portray Christmas this year
in Berlin as 1 saw it. Instead of a warm and lively
Yuletide celebration heailding the age-old dreams of
peace on earth and goodwill toward men, there was
the ceaseless, lonely gloom of protracted hatred and
ill will between F.ast and West.
In their propaganda fog the Soviets proclaimed
December as the month of German-Soviet Friend
ship instead of Christmas, and boomed even moie
vigorously their insidious, false-front campaign for
peace. People seeemd reallv unable to shake for a
moment their intense preoccupation with hard poli
tics and economic survival in order to experience a
Merry Christmas.
Yesterday I talked by phone to the ASSU's scholar
studying in Pari;-, Floyd St. Clair, who is celebrating
Christmas in London. He is enjoying immensely his
work in Paris and has on several occasions seen
Jeanne Maris Villar, who was an ASSU scholar last
year from France. Floyd recently received a lengthy

letter from Karl Kisler, 1050-51 ASSU Foreign Scholar
from Vienna, with whom Floyd lived during Spring
Quarter last year in Stern Hall. Tomorrow 1 will
journey on to Copenhagen for a visit with another of
our fornipr foieign scholars, Bent Pontoppidan.
No account of Berlin would be valid unless it at
tempted to describe the complicated economic circum
stances and problems of this city. Tbey not only
illustrate the everyday difficulties for the man-in-the
street of winning his daily bread, but they also play
a deciding role in determining how long West Berlin
can continue to hold out as an independent "island"
imide the Russian Zone of Occupation.
Today the West Berlin index of industrial produc
tion Cusing 1936 as base of 100) is 40, wheieas West
Germany's is 1.'!2. Many factors are responsible for
this remarkable difference. Berlin, because it. was
essentially a seat of government both for Germany as
a whole and for a state within the Federation, de
pended upon government activity and income to sup
port its people, not on highly developed industry. As
it is no longer able to derive such income, many of
its citizens are wandering jobless in a city desperately
trying to find new sources of economic survival.
Heavy bombings and street fighting of course de
stroyed huge amounts of personal property and
wealth. Beginning in 1945 dismantelings of industry,
especially those carried out by the Soviets, took away
about three quarters of Berlin's productive capacity.
And practically all working capital in the hands of
Germans was decimated in 1948 on account of the
Currency Reform which gave people one Deutsche
Mark for ten ftpichg Marks.
