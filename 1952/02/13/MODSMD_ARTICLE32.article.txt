## U. of Oregon Dorms Lose Private Phones 
### JIM MADISON 
THIS COULD HAPPEN HI.RE—
The PT&T has raised a huge ruckus
at the University, of Oregon by tak
ing all the private business phones
out of campus living groups, in
stalling pay phones, and then rais
ing the toll rate to 1U cents per local
call. The Daily Emerald spouted
editorial hell, the students massed
marched, howlef, and pulled ofl
protest gags, and even the adminis
tration went to bat with the tele
phone concern to seek reinstate
ment ol the business phones.
And now since the same stunt
was pulled oft on all Oregon college
campuses by the PT&T, any ad
justment awaits combined pressure
from all the colleges. Meanwhile
the Bell Telephone System contin

YOU THINK THERE ARE COUN
TRY CLUB CAMPUSES! Students
at the University of Texas went into
a major uproar recently when the
administration banned smoking and
drinking cokes in class, a custom of
long standing. Reason given was
excessive damage to classrooms
caused by spilled ashes and cola.
Before the thing blew over, one stu
dent proposed the rather novt-1 so
lution of installing an ash tray at
every seat. Next they'll probably
want cushions.

SCALE—At Wisconsin the class of
'52 has dropped the idea of just

directors will control the fund; and
Wisconsin will continue to receive
gifts from the class of '52 ad infini
