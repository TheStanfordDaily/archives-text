## The 						Sporting Line 
### 
Looking over the official basketball statistics put out by the National
Collegiate Athletic Bureau, you can fintl several pretty interesting things.
One thing lor sure, there is not a single Coast player in the top 25 scoring
leaders. Best the Pacific Coast has to offer is Bob Houbregs, the sensational
Washington center. Bob is 27th, and the only western eager to make a
list that goes as far down as the 48th spot.
Coupled with somewhat similar individual and team figures, it gives
a pretty clear indication that the West does not hold such a prominent
position in the basketball scene as enjoyed the past several years. The
chilt seems to be toward the athletically powerful Midwest.
Of the fifteen men listed for field goal percentage leaders, free throw
sharpshooters, and leaders in assists, not one Westerner appears. Bobby
Peterson, former Sequoia high school ace, and now a junior at Oregon,
ranks third in rebound leadership. Bob is averaging over 19 of the im
portant rebounds per game.
On the hrighter side, Stanford is wav up in toam scoring and shooting
accuracy. Tlu- Indian quintet is 23rd in team offense with a 74.4 average,
'l'lie Cards are tied for filth with Western Kentucky for field goal per
centage. Both are hitting an even 3!) per cent. Only .8 of a per cent
out of first, the Indians are hitting 70 per cent of their free throws,
lirake is first and Kansas is second.
Only other Western teams deserving a ranking are: Washington, third
in team defense and fourth in fewest personal fouls committed; Loyola of
Los Angeles, fifth in most fouls committed (over 26 per game); San Fran
cisco, 16th in team defense; Washington State, 18th in team defense; and
Santa Clara, 18th in free throw accuracy.
Teams and players dominating most of the ratings are Kentucky, Okla
homa A & M, Oklahoma City, Kansas State, Groat ol Duke, Lovellette of
Kansas, Darling of lowa, and Workman of West Virginia.
Look ni llie Playoffs
While the Southern Division race is tight as the guy that hangs around
Marquard's every night around 2 a.m., Washington appears to be a shoo-in
for the Pacific Coast championship. The Huskies are rumbling through the
Northern Division with amazing ease and look much too strong for the
eventual winner of the California section.
In comparison to (lie Huskies dominance of this sector,' the NCAA
regional playoffs at Kansas City shape up as the toughest in history.
Four teams in the region rank among the ten top teams in the nation,
according to the press polls. Only two will ever get to the Kansas City
finals.
The teams are Kansas and Kansas State of the Big Seven conference
and St. Louis and Oklahoma A & M of the Missouri Valley loop. The
Kansas-Kansas State feud is really keen. Kansas State ranked second in
the nation and runner-up to Kentucky in last year's national tourney, .
hoick a one game margin by virtue of their 81 to 64 victory over the j
Jayhawkers.
Coach Pliog Allen, Kansas' sharp mentor, has predicted that his team,
led by Lovellette, wili even the count when the teams meet again on the
Kansas floor. Over in the Valley league, St. Louis holds the edge with an
undefeated record in conference play.
FINAL AI)I) ON THE BASKETBALL PICTURE. Stanford is the
only team to score more than 70 points against the Phillips Oilers in the
ia.it two years. That's a pretty nice mark, considering the quality of the
titers' competition. By the way, maybe Stanford's good effort was a tipoff
to the big losing streak the Oilers just went through.
While on the subject of the Oilers, their future seems pretty rosy.
Don Henricksen, completing graduate work in geology at Stanford, has
a new job after grabbing off his advanced degree. And it's with the Phillips
firm. Other geology majors who have had part-time jobs are Clyde Lovel
lette of Kansas and Chuck Darling of lowa.

Received a letter in the mail the other day addressed to the Sports
Editor which is really a gem. Here goes:
"Members of the Stanford swim team who would like to pit their
speed against a penguin can do so by contacting the San Francisco Sports,
1 ravel and Boat Show opening at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium,
February 29.
"The show's marine midget, Perri the Penguin, will take on all comers
in the show's indoor .'5O by 60 foot pool, privately during the exposition's
ten day run.
"Challengers should contact Tom Rooney, the show manager at Doug- I
las 2-3:165."
How's that for a piece of correspondence?
ODDS AND ENDS—BiII MacMahon, Stanford's top light-heavie boxer
and a hot shot rugby candidate, dropped out of school this quarter. Took
a rest from the books, but should be back next quarter . . . Another
boxer, Ilerbie Cohen, had to quit Ray Lunny's squad. Reason? Bob i
Baldocchi gave him a broken beak during practice. Herb just got out of I
the Paly hospital after having his nose hammered into shape ... At
the annual football banquet held a while back, some awards were made.
Top frosh—Don Sanders. Top sophomore—Ron Cook. Top senior—Jesse
Cone. Most inspirational player—Scotty McKay. The whole squad re
ceived watches and gold footballs.

sharpshooters, and leaders in assists, not one Westerner appears. Bobby
Peterson, former Sequoia high school ace, and now a junior at Oregon,
ranks third in rebound leadership. Bob is averaging over 19 of the im
portant rebounds per game.
On the hrighter side, Stanford is wav up in toam scoring and shooting
accuracy. Tlu- Indian quintet is 23rd in team offense with a 74.4 average,
'l'lie Cards are tied for filth with Western Kentucky for field goal per
centage. Both are hitting an even 3!) per cent. Only .8 of a per cent
out of first, the Indians are hitting 70 per cent of their free throws,
lirake is first and Kansas is second.
Only other Western teams deserving a ranking are: Washington, third
in team defense and fourth in fewest personal fouls committed; Loyola of
Los Angeles, fifth in most fouls committed (over 26 per game); San Fran
cisco, 16th in team defense; Washington State, 18th in team defense; and
Santa Clara, 18th in free throw accuracy.
Teams and players dominating most of the ratings are Kentucky, Okla
homa A & M, Oklahoma City, Kansas State, Groat ol Duke, Lovellette of
Kansas, Darling of lowa, and Workman of West Virginia.
Look ni llie Playoffs
While the Southern Division race is tight as the guy that hangs around
Marquard's every night around 2 a.m., Washington appears to be a shoo-in
for the Pacific Coast championship. The Huskies are rumbling through the
Northern Division with amazing ease and look much too strong for the
eventual winner of the California section.
In comparison to (lie Huskies dominance of this sector,' the NCAA
regional playoffs at Kansas City shape up as the toughest in history.
Four teams in the region rank among the ten top teams in the nation,
according to the press polls. Only two will ever get to the Kansas City
finals.
The teams are Kansas and Kansas State of the Big Seven conference
and St. Louis and Oklahoma A & M of the Missouri Valley loop. The
Kansas-Kansas State feud is really keen. Kansas State ranked second in
the nation and runner-up to Kentucky in last year's national tourney, .
hoick a one game margin by virtue of their 81 to 64 victory over the j
Jayhawkers.
Coach Pliog Allen, Kansas' sharp mentor, has predicted that his team,
led by Lovellette, wili even the count when the teams meet again on the
Kansas floor. Over in the Valley league, St. Louis holds the edge with an
undefeated record in conference play.
FINAL AI)I) ON THE BASKETBALL PICTURE. Stanford is the
only team to score more than 70 points against the Phillips Oilers in the
ia.it two years. That's a pretty nice mark, considering the quality of the
titers' competition. By the way, maybe Stanford's good effort was a tipoff
to the big losing streak the Oilers just went through.
While on the subject of the Oilers, their future seems pretty rosy.
Don Henricksen, completing graduate work in geology at Stanford, has
a new job after grabbing off his advanced degree. And it's with the Phillips
firm. Other geology majors who have had part-time jobs are Clyde Lovel
lette of Kansas and Chuck Darling of lowa.

Received a letter in the mail the other day addressed to the Sports
Editor which is really a gem. Here goes:
"Members of the Stanford swim team who would like to pit their
speed against a penguin can do so by contacting the San Francisco Sports,
1 ravel and Boat Show opening at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium,
February 29.
"The show's marine midget, Perri the Penguin, will take on all comers
in the show's indoor .'5O by 60 foot pool, privately during the exposition's
ten day run.
"Challengers should contact Tom Rooney, the show manager at Doug- I
las 2-3:165."
How's that for a piece of correspondence?
ODDS AND ENDS—BiII MacMahon, Stanford's top light-heavie boxer
and a hot shot rugby candidate, dropped out of school this quarter. Took
a rest from the books, but should be back next quarter . . . Another
boxer, Ilerbie Cohen, had to quit Ray Lunny's squad. Reason? Bob i
Baldocchi gave him a broken beak during practice. Herb just got out of I
the Paly hospital after having his nose hammered into shape ... At
the annual football banquet held a while back, some awards were made.
Top frosh—Don Sanders. Top sophomore—Ron Cook. Top senior—Jesse
Cone. Most inspirational player—Scotty McKay. The whole squad re
ceived watches and gold footballs.
Looking over the official basketball statistics put out by the National
Collegiate Athletic Bureau, you can fintl several pretty interesting things.
One thing lor sure, there is not a single Coast player in the top 25 scoring
leaders. Best the Pacific Coast has to offer is Bob Houbregs, the sensational
Washington center. Bob is 27th, and the only western eager to make a
list that goes as far down as the 48th spot.
Coupled with somewhat similar individual and team figures, it gives
a pretty clear indication that the West does not hold such a prominent
position in the basketball scene as enjoyed the past several years. The

lirake is first and Kansas is second.
Only other Western teams deserving a ranking are: Washington, third
in team defense and fourth in fewest personal fouls committed; Loyola of
Los Angeles, fifth in most fouls committed (over 26 per game); San Fran
cisco, 16th in team defense; Washington State, 18th in team defense; and
Santa Clara, 18th in free throw accuracy.
Teams and players dominating most of the ratings are Kentucky, Okla
homa A & M, Oklahoma City, Kansas State, Groat ol Duke, Lovellette of
Kansas, Darling of lowa, and Workman of West Virginia.
Look ni llie Playoffs
While the Southern Division race is tight as the guy that hangs around
Marquard's every night around 2 a.m., Washington appears to be a shoo-in
for the Pacific Coast championship. The Huskies are rumbling through the
Northern Division with amazing ease and look much too strong for the
eventual winner of the California section.
In comparison to (lie Huskies dominance of this sector,' the NCAA
regional playoffs at Kansas City shape up as the toughest in history.
Four teams in the region rank among the ten top teams in the nation,
according to the press polls. Only two will ever get to the Kansas City
finals.
The teams are Kansas and Kansas State of the Big Seven conference
and St. Louis and Oklahoma A & M of the Missouri Valley loop. The
Kansas-Kansas State feud is really keen. Kansas State ranked second in
the nation and runner-up to Kentucky in last year's national tourney, .
hoick a one game margin by virtue of their 81 to 64 victory over the j
Jayhawkers.
Coach Pliog Allen, Kansas' sharp mentor, has predicted that his team,
led by Lovellette, wili even the count when the teams meet again on the
Kansas floor. Over in the Valley league, St. Louis holds the edge with an
undefeated record in conference play.
FINAL AI)I) ON THE BASKETBALL PICTURE. Stanford is the
only team to score more than 70 points against the Phillips Oilers in the
ia.it two years. That's a pretty nice mark, considering the quality of the
titers' competition. By the way, maybe Stanford's good effort was a tipoff
to the big losing streak the Oilers just went through.
While on the subject of the Oilers, their future seems pretty rosy.
Don Henricksen, completing graduate work in geology at Stanford, has
a new job after grabbing off his advanced degree. And it's with the Phillips
firm. Other geology majors who have had part-time jobs are Clyde Lovel
lette of Kansas and Chuck Darling of lowa.

Received a letter in the mail the other day addressed to the Sports
Editor which is really a gem. Here goes:
"Members of the Stanford swim team who would like to pit their
speed against a penguin can do so by contacting the San Francisco Sports,
1 ravel and Boat Show opening at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium,
February 29.
"The show's marine midget, Perri the Penguin, will take on all comers
in the show's indoor .'5O by 60 foot pool, privately during the exposition's
ten day run.
"Challengers should contact Tom Rooney, the show manager at Doug- I
las 2-3:165."
How's that for a piece of correspondence?
ODDS AND ENDS—BiII MacMahon, Stanford's top light-heavie boxer
and a hot shot rugby candidate, dropped out of school this quarter. Took
a rest from the books, but should be back next quarter . . . Another
boxer, Ilerbie Cohen, had to quit Ray Lunny's squad. Reason? Bob i
Baldocchi gave him a broken beak during practice. Herb just got out of I
the Paly hospital after having his nose hammered into shape ... At
the annual football banquet held a while back, some awards were made.
Top frosh—Don Sanders. Top sophomore—Ron Cook. Top senior—Jesse
Cone. Most inspirational player—Scotty McKay. The whole squad re
ceived watches and gold footballs.
Looking over the official basketball statistics put out by the National
Collegiate Athletic Bureau, you can fintl several pretty interesting things.
One thing lor sure, there is not a single Coast player in the top 25 scoring
leaders. Best the Pacific Coast has to offer is Bob Houbregs, the sensational
Washington center. Bob is 27th, and the only western eager to make a
list that goes as far down as the 48th spot.
Coupled with somewhat similar individual and team figures, it gives
a pretty clear indication that the West does not hold such a prominent
position in the basketball scene as enjoyed the past several years. The
chilt seems to be toward the athletically powerful Midwest.
Of the fifteen men listed for field goal percentage leaders, free throw
sharpshooters, and leaders in assists, not one Westerner appears. Bobby
Peterson, former Sequoia high school ace, and now a junior at Oregon,
ranks third in rebound leadership. Bob is averaging over 19 of the im
portant rebounds per game.
On the hrighter side, Stanford is wav up in toam scoring and shooting
accuracy. Tlu- Indian quintet is 23rd in team offense with a 74.4 average,
'l'lie Cards are tied for filth with Western Kentucky for field goal per
centage. Both are hitting an even 3!) per cent. Only .8 of a per cent
