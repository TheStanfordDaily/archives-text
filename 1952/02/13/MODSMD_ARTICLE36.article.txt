free throw by Jim O'Neil, a jump
. hot and lay-up by Owen Powell,
and a basket by Taylor gave the
Dekes a 19-point advantage, 29-10.
A last-minute drive by Sigma Chi,
led by Fred Miller and Dick Ket
tenburg, narrowed the gap as the

| game closed, giving the Dekes a
seven-point, 39-2G victory.
High point man for the evening
was Miller with six baskets and
one free throw for 13 points. Taylor
and Jaegar were close behind with
10 and nine points respectively for
the winners. Kettenburg of Siama

20 feet out, for a total of eight

court, while Jaegar and crew took
the majority of rebounds.
