# Cal Ringmen \Bop Cards 5-3; Three TKO's Listed
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
Cal's veteran boxing team pound
ed out a 5 to 3 win over Stanford's
sluggers before 500 roaring fans last
night in the Pavilion.
Veterans Bob White and Bob Bal
docchi came through as expected
for the Cards and a surprise win by
Gary Sievert in the 125-pound class
rounded out Stanford's victories.
The best fight of the night, how
ever, was the 178-pound battle of
Stanford's Tony Wynn and Cal's

Cari Koenig. Neither fighter could
block the other one's slants and the
result was a bloody, free-swinging
battle with both fighters wobbly
at the end. Koenig got the decisoin,
although most fans thought it was
a draw.
Another heroic Card loser was
Ed Scarboro, who almost held Cal's

hard-hitting Jay Slaybaugh to a
draw. Time and again Scarboro
would tag the Cal ace and retreat
before the counter-punching Slay
baugh could land one of his hay
makers.
Sievert's win over Emmett For
rester was the Stanford come
through of the night. Sievert has
improved amazingly with every
match. He scored steadily with his
jab and his occasional right hands
set his opponent wobbling.
White and Baldocchi both looked
good in their wins. Baldocchi
knocked Fred Shieman down twice
before referee Jack Downey stopped
it.
Other battles didn't go too well
for the Cards. Cal's star Ken Han
sen stopped Bob Chalmers in the
second round; Jim McCann TKO'd
Erik Hansen in the first frame; and
in the heavyweight bout, Dick Tull
son decisioned Marv Tennefoss.
