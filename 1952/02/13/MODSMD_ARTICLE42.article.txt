# Mermen Will Host Spartans On Thursday
## 
### 
Tom Haynie's swimmers will open
their competitive season tomorrow
evening with a tuneup meet against
San Jose State. The first event "will
begin in the Spartan plunge at 8.
Since the Spartans are weak, the
Cards will be swimming mainly
against the clock. Haynie has set
up times he thinks the swimmers
should match or beat at this stage
of their training.
With only 43 days left until the
NCAA meet, the few times record
ed for the Cards thus far rank with
the best reported in the country.
Pete Cole, embarking on his third
year as an outstanding Card dis
tance man, has already swum the
440 yards in 4:40 flat, third best re
ported this year.
Larry Heim's 200-yard backstroke
clocking of 2:13.4 is second fastest I
reported lor this event. Only Ohio
State's Jack Taylor with 2:09.8 has!
bested the Stanford freshman sen- |
sation.
