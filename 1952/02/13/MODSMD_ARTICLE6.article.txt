# Campus Police To Bear Down On Speeders
## 
### 
A
A firm "crack-down" on speeders
was promised by Campus Pol ire-
Chief Gordon Davis yesterday as he
said he was determined to ' put an
end to this roaring around."
Statin" tnat. a marked increase in
the number of traffic citations has
been noted of late, Davis said,
"There will be far more citations if
the speeding continues."
Complaining particularly of stu
dents who thunder around campus
in second gear, the chief warned
that traffic officers would "bear
down hard on violators."
Davis said that fines for speeding
run 50 cents a mile above the speed
limit for the first offense. Second
and third offense fines are scaled
higher. One student paid a $50 fine
last week after being caught speed
ing past Lagunita Court at GO miles
an hour, Davis reported.
