# Birkmeyer Cites The Use of 'Shock' in Modern Art
## 
### 
"If we want to understand modern
art, we must take it as a tool in a I
search into new realms rather than |
a faithful representation of an oh- j
ject of beauty," declared Karl M. j
Birkmeyer of the University Art De- '
partment in the second talk of the |
Intermezzo series presented by the
Library.
Birkmeyer, who talked yesterday
at 3:30 in the Bender Room, on
"Dadaixm, Surrealism, and So On"
admitted thai the many schools of
art (such as Cubism, Primativism,
and Symbolism) make understand- j
ing very difficult. These names, he !
explained, were given the paintings j
by the artists themselves.
In most kinds of modern art, sub
ject matter is subjugated to iorm,
design, color, and fooling of motion.
Both DadaisLs and Surrealists, he
said, use shock to interest and startle
their audience. Many of their paint
ings express subconscious thoughts
and desires, and "start where lan
guage ends."
) As aids to understanding modern
art, Birkmeyer advised that it should
I not be taken seriously and that we i
should approach it with an open
| mind.
