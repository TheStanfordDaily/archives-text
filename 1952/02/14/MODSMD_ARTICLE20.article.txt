# Curtain Will Rise Tonight on Three One-Acts
## 
### 
The curtain goes up tonight at R:l5 on the initial performances
of the three plays in the 1952 One-Acts put on by Ram's Head.
The basic idea of F. Stewart Joslyn's drama "Red Sky at Night"
is that improvement cannot be made by destructive means. The
action takes place in a Shore Patrol station, and is mainly a con-

flict, between Lieutenant, Anderson,
an idealist who hates violence, and
Vancssi, who respects physical
strength. When Vancssi uses force
in his treatment of a prisoner, drama
flares between the two men, and
Anderson finds himself forced to use
the brutality he hates to discipline
Vanessi. Hal Burdick Jr. and Ned
Hutchinson portray Anderson and
Vanessi, and Hex (Junn is the play's
director. Joslyn's play received
honors last year in the annual Dra
matists Alliance national contest.
Pat Foster's satirical fantasy "Turn
Down an Empty Glass'" presents the
problem of reality versus illusion.
Directed by Tetl Shank, the play
takes place in Halphie HaMig's an
tique shop. Characters that appeal
during the action are a poet, a [wint
er. and a musician, who typify the
foibles of human nature, plus a drunk
that could be found only in the
imagination. Dick Winter portrays
thq leading role of Ralphie.
A social problem is expounded in
Ward Tanzer's "Passage to Pome,"
which is directed by Dolores Adams.
Mac and Chris, who have been living

together in Tahiti, are returning to
California in a tramp steamer. They
must choose between trying to pre
serve their freedom in the magic life
they have known or consenting to
he married according to the dictates
of society. Bob Smith as Mac and
Pat Beverly as Chris are greatly in
fluenced by Both, a lovely Tahitian
girl who is played by Buzzy Dam
rosh.
Tickets for Friday and Saturday
night performances are available in
the Memorial Auditorium box office
and will be sold at Engineering cor
ner from 9 to 3 today.

The curtain goes up tonight at R:l5 on the initial performances
of the three plays in the 1952 One-Acts put on by Ram's Head.
The basic idea of F. Stewart Joslyn's drama "Red Sky at Night"
is that improvement cannot be made by destructive means. The
action takes place in a Shore Patrol station, and is mainly a con-

flict, between Lieutenant, Anderson,
an idealist who hates violence, and
Vancssi, who respects physical
strength. When Vancssi uses force
in his treatment of a prisoner, drama
flares between the two men, and
Anderson finds himself forced to use
the brutality he hates to discipline
Vanessi. Hal Burdick Jr. and Ned
Hutchinson portray Anderson and
Vanessi, and Hex (Junn is the play's
director. Joslyn's play received
honors last year in the annual Dra
matists Alliance national contest.
Pat Foster's satirical fantasy "Turn
Down an Empty Glass'" presents the
problem of reality versus illusion.
Directed by Tetl Shank, the play
takes place in Halphie HaMig's an
tique shop. Characters that appeal
during the action are a poet, a [wint
er. and a musician, who typify the
foibles of human nature, plus a drunk
that could be found only in the
imagination. Dick Winter portrays
thq leading role of Ralphie.
A social problem is expounded in
Ward Tanzer's "Passage to Pome,"
which is directed by Dolores Adams.
Mac and Chris, who have been living

together in Tahiti, are returning to
California in a tramp steamer. They
must choose between trying to pre
serve their freedom in the magic life
they have known or consenting to
he married according to the dictates
of society. Bob Smith as Mac and
Pat Beverly as Chris are greatly in
fluenced by Both, a lovely Tahitian
girl who is played by Buzzy Dam
rosh.
Tickets for Friday and Saturday
night performances are available in
the Memorial Auditorium box office
and will be sold at Engineering cor
ner from 9 to 3 today.
