# Excom Takes Away Young GOP Approval
## Action Taken Unanimously 
### 
Excom last night withdrew its
recommendation to the Board of
Trustees that a constitution be
approved for the now unofficial
Stanford Young Republicans.
The action was taken unani
mously.
Recommendation that the Trus
tees approve the group's constitu
tion was made last quarter.
Excom further appointed a four
man committee to study methods of
stimulating student political inter
est other than by chartering parti
san political groups.
Barry Jackson, Village represen
tative, was appointed to draw up a
statement of reasons for Excom's
action in withdrawing its recom
mendation. The statement is to be
based on the following four points:
1. That Excom recognizes the de
sirability of political education for
students.
2. That this can be accomplished
best by non-partisan groups.
3. That of the three objects of a
partisan group—education, civic in
formation, and political action—the
first two can be provided by non
partisan organizations, and the third
—political action—is undesirable at
Stanford.
4. That chartering a partisan or
ganization such as the Young Re
publicans would open the door to
any and all party groups.
The committee to study methods
of providing for political education
programs is composed of Everett
Clark, chairman, George Denny,
Ellie Rudolph, and Jack Fraser. The
committee was instructed to solicit
outside help as it sees fit.
The committee heard several pre
liminary suggestions from Exccm
members on possible methods.
One called for a program to he
set up by the Committee on Pub
lic Exercises aided by a student
group to present speaker forums
on political issues.
Mary Anna Aldrich, of the YW
CA, said her group is considering
sponsorship of public discussion
groups on political and civic sub
jects. She said plans are nebulous
now, but the YWCA would prob
ably undertake such programs if not
provided by another organization.
The temporary investigating com
mittee is to communicate with other
schools to determine how the prob
lem of political programs is set up
elsewhere. It will make interim re
ports before submitting final recom
mendations. The first interim report
will probably be made at next
week's meeting.
