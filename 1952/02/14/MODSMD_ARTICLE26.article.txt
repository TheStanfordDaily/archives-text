# Good Luck, Viewpoint!

Viewpoint Maqazine, which could become
Stanford's fourili major student publication,
makes its debut today. The question many stu
dents are asking is "Will it go over?"
And with good reason. The record of similar
magazines at Slanford in the past is one of
financial failure.
The Seguoia, the Cardinal, the Spectator, The
Pictorial, The Stanford Lit., and the Carillon
started up optimistically, beqan losing sales,
and folded dismally—chiefly because students'
short stories and avant-garde poetry or, in some
cases, analyses of world problems, which made
up the magazines, didn't have a wide appeal.
We doubt if it's any different now. A new
magazine will have to appeal to broad tastes if
it is going to be financially stable. And finan
cial stability, like it or not, is mighty essential.
Viewpoint seems to have hit a pretty good
formula. Two lead articles are "Eootball in
its Place," by Bill McColl and "A Soldier's
Story . . . Korea." by student Tom Beal. Both

are crack jobs.
Viewpoint's difficulty will probably turn out
to be producing magazines consistent in qual
ity with the first issue. It has set a hiqh standard
for future efforts. But it can be consistently
reached.
Our advice, if it's not resented from a
slightly different branch of journalism, is
this: Keep the magazine lively, interesting,
varied, and avoid over-emphasis ol student
fiction contributions. Perlorm a function no
general magazine performs. And relate ar
ticles to student and educational problems
whenever possible.
Viewpoint's policy to accentuate the contro
versial is a good one. It will be difficult to con
sistently find good interesting articles of this
type and thus maintain the present policy of
keepinq fiction to TjO per cent.
But whatever lines development takes, con
gratulations, Viewpoint, on a fine first issue,
and best of luck on the rest of them.
