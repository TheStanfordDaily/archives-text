# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Tilings were going like things ought to be going the
other day. Spring was just around the corner, pre
paring for its majestic entrance. I had just passed a
midterm, and the basketball team had just woh two
games. I walked into the Daily Shack, finished off
the third aria from Puccini, and sat down to read
Bill Leiser's column.
Whereupon several gentlemen in black uniforms
stomped in the Shack, one shouting. "Thore he is."

"What is this, an advertisement
for a funeral parlor?" I said, try
ing to make a funny.
"No, we are members of the
NROTC," one explained, putting
his cigarette out in the palm of
my hand.
"Ouch," I admitted.
"We are not bus drivers, nor
do we wear bus drivers' uniforms,
as you said in a Bull Session,"
said another, dropping a type
writer on my foot.
"Oww," I allowed.

"It's the Air ROTC that wears the uniforms that
look like those of bus drivers," another emphasized.
All of which brings me to the point that it's the
Air RO that wears bus drivers' uniforms, not ROTC.
The Air RO, understand?

HANDWRITING ON THE WALL DI PT. One of
the boys up at the Beta house recently took out a
girl from San Mateo. The windows steamed up, and
the girl finger-painted several sayings that Mr. Web
ster would lie embarrassed to put in his dictionary.
The windows unsteamed, and the boy from the Beta
house thought nothing more about it.
Then, the next night he took out his girl friend
from Stanford. The windows steamed up again, and
the tell-tale sayings reappeared.
To say that the girl was disturbed would be the

understatement of the year.
I just received a letter from Wally White, Stan
ford's answer to Cole Porter. White, who wrote the
music for the Spring Show last year, is studying at
the Sorbonne in Paris. He reports that the French
are hot for American songs, but that they are a little
behind the times. Popular now is Bonsoir Lily
(Goodnight Irene.)

PRISONER OF LOVE DEPT. T'd like you to meet
a character here on campus named Bob Wilcox. You
probably know him already, maybe not by his real
name, but by the moniker "Warren G. Wonka." As
you may remember, it was Wilcox who gave his
name as being Warren G. Wonka to a policeman alter
a slight auto accident this fall. lie was one of .six
band members going up to the Washington game
when the mishap occurred. An Associated Press re
porter and a United Press scribe got ahold of the
list of names. And all up and down the Coast, papers
were running a list of names that included Warren G.
Wonka from Watsonville.
Wilcox's latest antics is wearing "prisoner of love
pajamas." Wilcox, who incidentally is the high scorer
on the Breakers Eating Club intra-mural team, is
engaged to a girl in Eureka. He asked her to be his
forever and a day on the eighteenth of the month.
And so on the eighteenth of each month, Bob and his
financee go through a little ritual. He (at Stanford)
and she (at Eureka) wear their "prisoner of love
pajamas." The pajamas are black-and-white striped.
Just like a jailbird's raiments. The only difference
is that there is a big red heart in the center.
Quite a character, this Wilcox.

Whereupon several gentlemen in black uniforms
stomped in the Shack, one shouting. "Thore he is."

"What is this, an advertisement
for a funeral parlor?" I said, try
ing to make a funny.
"No, we are members of the
NROTC," one explained, putting
his cigarette out in the palm of
my hand.
"Ouch," I admitted.
"We are not bus drivers, nor
do we wear bus drivers' uniforms,
as you said in a Bull Session,"
said another, dropping a type
writer on my foot.
"Oww," I allowed.

"It's the Air ROTC that wears the uniforms that
look like those of bus drivers," another emphasized.
All of which brings me to the point that it's the
Air RO that wears bus drivers' uniforms, not ROTC.
The Air RO, understand?

HANDWRITING ON THE WALL DI PT. One of
the boys up at the Beta house recently took out a
girl from San Mateo. The windows steamed up, and
the girl finger-painted several sayings that Mr. Web
ster would lie embarrassed to put in his dictionary.
The windows unsteamed, and the boy from the Beta
house thought nothing more about it.
Then, the next night he took out his girl friend
from Stanford. The windows steamed up again, and
the tell-tale sayings reappeared.
To say that the girl was disturbed would be the

understatement of the year.
I just received a letter from Wally White, Stan
ford's answer to Cole Porter. White, who wrote the
music for the Spring Show last year, is studying at
the Sorbonne in Paris. He reports that the French
are hot for American songs, but that they are a little
behind the times. Popular now is Bonsoir Lily
(Goodnight Irene.)

PRISONER OF LOVE DEPT. T'd like you to meet
a character here on campus named Bob Wilcox. You
probably know him already, maybe not by his real
name, but by the moniker "Warren G. Wonka." As
you may remember, it was Wilcox who gave his
name as being Warren G. Wonka to a policeman alter
a slight auto accident this fall. lie was one of .six
band members going up to the Washington game
when the mishap occurred. An Associated Press re
porter and a United Press scribe got ahold of the
list of names. And all up and down the Coast, papers
were running a list of names that included Warren G.
Wonka from Watsonville.
Wilcox's latest antics is wearing "prisoner of love
pajamas." Wilcox, who incidentally is the high scorer
on the Breakers Eating Club intra-mural team, is
engaged to a girl in Eureka. He asked her to be his
forever and a day on the eighteenth of the month.
And so on the eighteenth of each month, Bob and his
financee go through a little ritual. He (at Stanford)
and she (at Eureka) wear their "prisoner of love
pajamas." The pajamas are black-and-white striped.
Just like a jailbird's raiments. The only difference
is that there is a big red heart in the center.
Quite a character, this Wilcox.

Tilings were going like things ought to be going the

the third aria from Puccini, and sat down to read
