## Economic Trouble in Berlin 
### 
(Edtior's note: Phil Nielsen, Stanford Exchange
Scholar at the Free University of Berlin, tells mcve
about the German city's economic problems in the
following second part of a letter he wrote Dec. 29
to the Stanford student body.)
Currently one third of the labor-force of West
Berlin is without work. These workers depend on
minimum subsistance allowances from the West Ber
lin Senat (which in total supports 960,(X)0 people out
of a total population of a little over 2,000.000) and on
make-work projects financed by American aid. In
front of our Studentenheim, Marshall Plan and
GARIOA money is widening an avenue in a very
primitive manner so as to create a maximum of jobs.
For example, numerous workers on this job put in
eight hours of monotony crudely splitting bricks from
bombed out buildings to be used as road base. When
they receive their wage, which is considerably below
the average wage rate for normal work in West Ber
lin, they must spend hours travelling all over seeking
the cheapest places to buy groceries so as to stretch
their meager earnings as far as possible. The old
assumption of an economic system which, through
make-work projects, could eventually be brought to
full employment, is of mere academic interest in Ber
lin, for each month thousands of new workers, in the
form of political refugees, swell the ranks of the un
employed.
Commerce is severely hampered by the two-money
system which prevails between East and West Ger
many. Only in East Berlin is it possible to purchase
with East Marks which have a value in exchange
shops of about one fourth of a West German Mark,
the only valid currency in West Berlin. Because of
the favorable exchange rate, many West Berliners
purchase East Marks and, with terrific personal ad
vantage, go shopping in the East. This action, how
ever, is to the direct deteriment of West Berlin shop
keepers who cannot possibly compete on this price
basis and who are therefore forced out of business.
By the practice of suddenly dumping huge quantities
of goods on the East Berlin Market, the crafty Rus
sians succeed in depressing prices there lower and
lower, thus draining life and competitive ability rapid
ly away from West Berlin. And as a special Christmas
tactic this year, the Reds sunk prices in their state
owned retail stores (which strongly predominate in

East Berlin) from 15 to 50%! Naturally the West
Berlin Seriate attempts to control buying by Western
ers in the East by stopping all cars entering the West
from the East and by questioning on West-bound
subways and buses persons with filled market bas
kets.
Successful marketing of Berlin goods in West Ger
many is painfully handicapped. The distance from
Berlin to the Federal Republic through the Russian
Zone adds high transpoitatiori costs not faced at all
by West German firms trading in the Wtst. Soviet
controls on the borders always slow up traffic, halt
much for no good reason, and prohibit other goods
from moving at all. We now have, for example, a
crippling coal shortage in Berlin due to nonsensical
Russian border controls. Even when one completely
avoids land transport in favor of the more expensive
air shipment, it is a long wait for available planes.
The result of all these obstacles is shown clearly by
the statement of a friend of mine who owns a large
chain of food stores in Berlin: "Since the end of the
Blockade in 1948, I have not been able to send a
single shipment of goods lo West Germany on time
according to my contracts, because of Soviet trans
portation tie-ups." Dealers in West Germany would
obviously prefer to do business where orders are
promptly delivered.
Regardless of what is rightly said every day about
maintaining Berlin as a "show-window of freedom be
hind the Iron Curtain," we should not lose sight of
what a task this entails in the long run. True, the
West Berliners for their part are endowed with a
magnificant sense of courage and zeal to survive in
the face of their hardships. Since 1945 they have
wrought a great deal and even now their index of
industrial productivity stands at 90",' of the 193(5 level.
But the hundreds of thousands si ill jobless in West
Berlin arid the sad state of the economy there give
the Reds a priceless propaganda weapon against the
capitalistic western way of life. The incentive for
large West Berlin firms to perserve and continue los
ing capital in this somewhat of a sinkhole is not too
attractive over time. In the face of Soviet designs
on Berlin, that fllighty and indispensable prerequisite
of a healthy capitalism — confidence —is extremely
difficult to foster among West Germans who have
money to invest.
