# 'Eyes of Asia Upon Us' In Crucial Okinawa Area
## 
### MARK FRANKLIN 
George 11. Kerr, research associate in the Hoover Institute and
Library, has just returned from a month's visit in the Far East, con
vinced that more attention must be given to this area, especially
Okinawa in the Ryukyu Islands.
Kerr asserts that now that we are definitely committed in this

area as a matter of national policy,
it is essential that the American
people be informed about the peo
ples and problems of the region. An
informed public, armed with the
tacts, will be able to re-evaluate the
importance of this vital Far Eastern
area and enable our policy-makers
and administrators to act with con
fidence and assurance in the Far
East.
It is not enoiv'h, says Kerr, that
we maintain a large military base
on Okinawa. That island inUst be
come' an example of what we can
do in the way of reconstructing a
war-ruined economy, and restor
ing a country to administrative
self-control. The critical eyes of
Asia are upon us in this small but
crucial area, and all our actions
are being observed witli the clos
est interest. We must demon
strate, says Kerr, that we can
perform well on Okinawa, thus
setting an example that may win
the confidence of the remaining
Asiatic peoples who have thus far
resisted the tempting beckonings
of the Communist camp. With
confidence will come co-opera
tion, he continued, and with co
operation, unity in the Far East.
Kerr's return to the Far East,
scheduled for next month, will be
sponsored by the Pacific Science
Board, a member agency of the Na
tional Research Council. The Pa
cific Science Board has set up the
SIRI (Scientific Investigation of the
Ryukyu Islands), an agency which
accumulates and studies data and
documents concerning every aspect
of life in the Ryukyus. Kerr will
serve in this program when he re
turns to the Ryukyus next month,
fie will start at the southernmost
island of the group, go on to Oki
nawa, and then proceed to Japan.
There he will consult with Japa
nese scholars familiar with Ryukyus
history, who will provide him with
documents that will enable him to

complete his study of' the area.
Kerr will return to Stanford in
the autumn to compile his findings,
and will present them in a seminar
covering Japan, the Ryukyus, and
,Japan's expansionist history in the
Far East.
Kerr indicated thai it is here at
Stanford Ui.it important ami valu
able work concerning this area is
being done. In fact, lie added,
the Hoover Institute has become
something of a focal point for Far
Eastern studies.
Kerr observed that extremely cor
dial relations exist between Stan
ford anil Japanese universities and
libraries.
Kerr expresses eagerness and
confidence in the vast but exciting
work that lies before him: '"I hope
that through this next trip, we can
bring to Stanford materials which
will be of nationwide usefulness and
importance in support of American
obligations anil commitments in the
Ryukyus," he said.

sponsored by the Pacific Science
Board, a member agency of the Na
tional Research Council. The Pa
cific Science Board has set up the
SIRI (Scientific Investigation of the
Ryukyu Islands), an agency which
accumulates and studies data and
documents concerning every aspect
of life in the Ryukyus. Kerr will
serve in this program when he re
turns to the Ryukyus next month,
fie will start at the southernmost
island of the group, go on to Oki
nawa, and then proceed to Japan.
There he will consult with Japa
nese scholars familiar with Ryukyus
history, who will provide him with
documents that will enable him to

complete his study of' the area.
Kerr will return to Stanford in
the autumn to compile his findings,
and will present them in a seminar
covering Japan, the Ryukyus, and
,Japan's expansionist history in the
Far East.
Kerr indicated thai it is here at
Stanford Ui.it important ami valu
able work concerning this area is
being done. In fact, lie added,
the Hoover Institute has become
something of a focal point for Far
Eastern studies.
Kerr observed that extremely cor
dial relations exist between Stan
ford anil Japanese universities and
libraries.
Kerr expresses eagerness and
confidence in the vast but exciting
work that lies before him: '"I hope
that through this next trip, we can
bring to Stanford materials which
will be of nationwide usefulness and
importance in support of American
obligations anil commitments in the
Ryukyus," he said.
George 11. Kerr, research associate in the Hoover Institute and
Library, has just returned from a month's visit in the Far East, con
vinced that more attention must be given to this area, especially
Okinawa in the Ryukyu Islands.
Kerr asserts that now that we are definitely committed in this

area as a matter of national policy,
it is essential that the American
people be informed about the peo
ples and problems of the region. An
informed public, armed with the
tacts, will be able to re-evaluate the
importance of this vital Far Eastern
area and enable our policy-makers
and administrators to act with con
fidence and assurance in the Far
East.
It is not enoiv'h, says Kerr, that
we maintain a large military base
on Okinawa. That island inUst be
come' an example of what we can
do in the way of reconstructing a
war-ruined economy, and restor
ing a country to administrative
self-control. The critical eyes of
Asia are upon us in this small but
crucial area, and all our actions
are being observed witli the clos
est interest. We must demon
strate, says Kerr, that we can
perform well on Okinawa, thus
setting an example that may win
the confidence of the remaining
Asiatic peoples who have thus far
resisted the tempting beckonings
of the Communist camp. With
confidence will come co-opera
tion, he continued, and with co
operation, unity in the Far East.
