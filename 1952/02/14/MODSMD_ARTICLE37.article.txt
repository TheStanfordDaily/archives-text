# PRO AND CAHN

### 
It's home coming day this Saturday when an invading Olympic Club
I»ugby team meets the Stanford Ruggers.
We ran into Sarge I.ittlehale the other day and the Stanford rugby player
of two seasons back informed us that this year's Olympic Club is loaded
with ex-Cards and even a couple of Berkeleyites.
Heading the list is Dr. Dave Brown who played end for the Cards on
the I!J4(J varsity. Johnny Rosekrans who held down the center spot for a
spell will becoming back. Other notables are Rick Supple, Dick Hughes, and
Sam Halstead. And of course Mr. Littlehale.
From the California Campus comes Carl Van Huett and Ed Welch.
It should be quite an afternoon. Not only old home week but a good
fame of rugby will be on tap. Rugby is a fast, rugged game. The Stanford
squad is bolstered by numerous grid stalwarts. In fact, rugby can be de
scribed in a phrase as "football without pads."
Returning to the current point of discussion, we note that California, now
leading the Conference, goes to the Southland to meet USC in a two game
basketball series. The Bears have just returned from the Islands. The trip
though financially successful, cost the Californians dearly in manpower.
Ilupe Ricksen dislocated a shoulder and will probably be sidelined for the
rest of the season. His twin, John just returned to action after twisting a
foot and is not entirely reliable. Jim Doan, Cal's leading scorer, severely
bruised a heel and his status is doubtful. This Bear tough luck obviously
boosts Card stock in the PCC race.
After many, many games of excellent basketball, Stanford's own Jim
Walsh finally received some well deserved recognition when the Northern
California Basketball Writers and SporUasters Association voted Jim
"Player of the Week." It does seem like it is a bit overdue.
Coach Bob Burnett has high praise for the senior from San Francisco.
Bob said, "Ever since Jimmy arrived on the Farm we have felt that what
Stanford needs in basketball is more Irishmen. Jim is a terrific scrapper
who never lets up, even if the varsity is scrimmaging against the scrubs.'"
"He has a lot of will to succeed, great drive and great, hustle," Burnett
added. "I hope he has an opportunity, after finishing Stanford, to play with
some top amateur team. He certainly would be a strong addition to any
club." Mighty nice words to a mighty deserving ballplayer.
Jim's record this season speaks for itself. In twenty-two games, Walsh
has bit. mi 3(> per cent of his shots from the floor. Anyone who has seen Jim
play knows his shots are mostly of the long variety. His record from the
free throw line is right near the seventy per cent mark. Walsh more than
does his shore in the rebound department. His game average, 12.5 points.
In conference scoring Walsh is fourth in Southern Division standings, and
then only behind Ed Tucker, Ron Tomsic, and Jim Ramstead, all Cards.
Burnett while commenting on Walsh at the award luncheon, also brought
in his views on the Conference race and Stanford in particular.
"There is every indication," Burnett said, "that the race may wind up
in a fie." As for the USC-California series, I don't know how to root. I
don't want the Bears to get anv farther ahead, hut yet I want one of the
Northern teams to win the Division (Stanford or California). "I still think
thai Stanford has a definite chance, although we'll probably have to win
five of the six games left to be played."
Burnett will stick with the platoon system which he introduced several
games back. There are primarily two reasons for this. The most important
being that during the last four games in which the system has been em
ployed, none of the regulars have fouled out. In previous games the Indians
had lost an average of two first stringers in each contest. The second reason
is simply that the way Burnett has been substituting his men affords the
regulars a longer rest and still permits them to operate as a single unit.
To date the second platoon has been playing good ball. Seldom has a team
outscored the slow breaking, ball controlling reserves.
Paul Johnson, who was sidelined for the early part of the season with
yellow jaundice, has fully recovered and at least temporarily has replaced
Olie Suzdaleff in the starting quintet. Johnson is "dead" from almost any
spot on the floor and Olie has his work cut out for him in replacing the
red-thatched guard.
So this weekend the UCLA Bruins come to town. The Bruins are even
up in Conference play with three wins and three losses. The Injuns are in
the basement with two and four. Dick Ridgway, who led the conference
scoring parade last season, did not return to the Westwooders following a
period of ineligibility. Dick is saving his year for 1953, much to the mixed
emotions of Johnny Wooden, who would like Dick this year but would
like him around UCLA for as many full seasons as possible.
This is the week of the crucials; hut not only the first week. From now
on every game is a must for Card flag hopes. We think Stanford has what
it takes.

don't want the Bears to get anv farther ahead, hut yet I want one of the
Northern teams to win the Division (Stanford or California). "I still think
thai Stanford has a definite chance, although we'll probably have to win
five of the six games left to be played."
Burnett will stick with the platoon system which he introduced several
games back. There are primarily two reasons for this. The most important
being that during the last four games in which the system has been em
ployed, none of the regulars have fouled out. In previous games the Indians
had lost an average of two first stringers in each contest. The second reason
is simply that the way Burnett has been substituting his men affords the
regulars a longer rest and still permits them to operate as a single unit.
To date the second platoon has been playing good ball. Seldom has a team
outscored the slow breaking, ball controlling reserves.
Paul Johnson, who was sidelined for the early part of the season with
yellow jaundice, has fully recovered and at least temporarily has replaced
Olie Suzdaleff in the starting quintet. Johnson is "dead" from almost any
spot on the floor and Olie has his work cut out for him in replacing the
red-thatched guard.
So this weekend the UCLA Bruins come to town. The Bruins are even
up in Conference play with three wins and three losses. The Injuns are in
the basement with two and four. Dick Ridgway, who led the conference
scoring parade last season, did not return to the Westwooders following a
period of ineligibility. Dick is saving his year for 1953, much to the mixed
emotions of Johnny Wooden, who would like Dick this year but would
like him around UCLA for as many full seasons as possible.
This is the week of the crucials; hut not only the first week. From now
on every game is a must for Card flag hopes. We think Stanford has what
it takes.
It's home coming day this Saturday when an invading Olympic Club
I»ugby team meets the Stanford Ruggers.
We ran into Sarge I.ittlehale the other day and the Stanford rugby player
of two seasons back informed us that this year's Olympic Club is loaded
with ex-Cards and even a couple of Berkeleyites.
Heading the list is Dr. Dave Brown who played end for the Cards on
the I!J4(J varsity. Johnny Rosekrans who held down the center spot for a
spell will becoming back. Other notables are Rick Supple, Dick Hughes, and
Sam Halstead. And of course Mr. Littlehale.
From the California Campus comes Carl Van Huett and Ed Welch.
It should be quite an afternoon. Not only old home week but a good
fame of rugby will be on tap. Rugby is a fast, rugged game. The Stanford
squad is bolstered by numerous grid stalwarts. In fact, rugby can be de
scribed in a phrase as "football without pads."
Returning to the current point of discussion, we note that California, now
leading the Conference, goes to the Southland to meet USC in a two game
basketball series. The Bears have just returned from the Islands. The trip
though financially successful, cost the Californians dearly in manpower.
Ilupe Ricksen dislocated a shoulder and will probably be sidelined for the
rest of the season. His twin, John just returned to action after twisting a
foot and is not entirely reliable. Jim Doan, Cal's leading scorer, severely
bruised a heel and his status is doubtful. This Bear tough luck obviously
boosts Card stock in the PCC race.
After many, many games of excellent basketball, Stanford's own Jim
Walsh finally received some well deserved recognition when the Northern
California Basketball Writers and SporUasters Association voted Jim
"Player of the Week." It does seem like it is a bit overdue.
Coach Bob Burnett has high praise for the senior from San Francisco.
Bob said, "Ever since Jimmy arrived on the Farm we have felt that what
Stanford needs in basketball is more Irishmen. Jim is a terrific scrapper
who never lets up, even if the varsity is scrimmaging against the scrubs.'"
"He has a lot of will to succeed, great drive and great, hustle," Burnett
added. "I hope he has an opportunity, after finishing Stanford, to play with
some top amateur team. He certainly would be a strong addition to any
club." Mighty nice words to a mighty deserving ballplayer.
Jim's record this season speaks for itself. In twenty-two games, Walsh
has bit. mi 3(> per cent of his shots from the floor. Anyone who has seen Jim
play knows his shots are mostly of the long variety. His record from the
free throw line is right near the seventy per cent mark. Walsh more than
does his shore in the rebound department. His game average, 12.5 points.
In conference scoring Walsh is fourth in Southern Division standings, and
then only behind Ed Tucker, Ron Tomsic, and Jim Ramstead, all Cards.
Burnett while commenting on Walsh at the award luncheon, also brought
in his views on the Conference race and Stanford in particular.

Ilupe Ricksen dislocated a shoulder and will probably be sidelined for the
rest of the season. His twin, John just returned to action after twisting a
foot and is not entirely reliable. Jim Doan, Cal's leading scorer, severely
bruised a heel and his status is doubtful. This Bear tough luck obviously
boosts Card stock in the PCC race.
After many, many games of excellent basketball, Stanford's own Jim
Walsh finally received some well deserved recognition when the Northern
California Basketball Writers and SporUasters Association voted Jim
"Player of the Week." It does seem like it is a bit overdue.
Coach Bob Burnett has high praise for the senior from San Francisco.
Bob said, "Ever since Jimmy arrived on the Farm we have felt that what
Stanford needs in basketball is more Irishmen. Jim is a terrific scrapper
who never lets up, even if the varsity is scrimmaging against the scrubs.'"
"He has a lot of will to succeed, great drive and great, hustle," Burnett
added. "I hope he has an opportunity, after finishing Stanford, to play with
some top amateur team. He certainly would be a strong addition to any
club." Mighty nice words to a mighty deserving ballplayer.
Jim's record this season speaks for itself. In twenty-two games, Walsh
has bit. mi 3(> per cent of his shots from the floor. Anyone who has seen Jim
play knows his shots are mostly of the long variety. His record from the
free throw line is right near the seventy per cent mark. Walsh more than
does his shore in the rebound department. His game average, 12.5 points.
In conference scoring Walsh is fourth in Southern Division standings, and
then only behind Ed Tucker, Ron Tomsic, and Jim Ramstead, all Cards.
Burnett while commenting on Walsh at the award luncheon, also brought
in his views on the Conference race and Stanford in particular.
"There is every indication," Burnett said, "that the race may wind up
in a fie." As for the USC-California series, I don't know how to root. I
don't want the Bears to get anv farther ahead, hut yet I want one of the
Northern teams to win the Division (Stanford or California). "I still think
thai Stanford has a definite chance, although we'll probably have to win
five of the six games left to be played."
Burnett will stick with the platoon system which he introduced several
games back. There are primarily two reasons for this. The most important
being that during the last four games in which the system has been em
ployed, none of the regulars have fouled out. In previous games the Indians
had lost an average of two first stringers in each contest. The second reason
is simply that the way Burnett has been substituting his men affords the
regulars a longer rest and still permits them to operate as a single unit.
To date the second platoon has been playing good ball. Seldom has a team
outscored the slow breaking, ball controlling reserves.
Paul Johnson, who was sidelined for the early part of the season with
yellow jaundice, has fully recovered and at least temporarily has replaced
Olie Suzdaleff in the starting quintet. Johnson is "dead" from almost any
spot on the floor and Olie has his work cut out for him in replacing the
red-thatched guard.
So this weekend the UCLA Bruins come to town. The Bruins are even
up in Conference play with three wins and three losses. The Injuns are in
the basement with two and four. Dick Ridgway, who led the conference
scoring parade last season, did not return to the Westwooders following a
period of ineligibility. Dick is saving his year for 1953, much to the mixed
emotions of Johnny Wooden, who would like Dick this year but would
like him around UCLA for as many full seasons as possible.
This is the week of the crucials; hut not only the first week. From now
on every game is a must for Card flag hopes. We think Stanford has what
it takes.
It's home coming day this Saturday when an invading Olympic Club
I»ugby team meets the Stanford Ruggers.
We ran into Sarge I.ittlehale the other day and the Stanford rugby player
of two seasons back informed us that this year's Olympic Club is loaded
with ex-Cards and even a couple of Berkeleyites.
Heading the list is Dr. Dave Brown who played end for the Cards on
the I!J4(J varsity. Johnny Rosekrans who held down the center spot for a
spell will becoming back. Other notables are Rick Supple, Dick Hughes, and
Sam Halstead. And of course Mr. Littlehale.
From the California Campus comes Carl Van Huett and Ed Welch.
It should be quite an afternoon. Not only old home week but a good
fame of rugby will be on tap. Rugby is a fast, rugged game. The Stanford
squad is bolstered by numerous grid stalwarts. In fact, rugby can be de
scribed in a phrase as "football without pads."
Returning to the current point of discussion, we note that California, now
leading the Conference, goes to the Southland to meet USC in a two game
basketball series. The Bears have just returned from the Islands. The trip
though financially successful, cost the Californians dearly in manpower.
