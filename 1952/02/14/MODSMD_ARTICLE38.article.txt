# Delta Chi Edges NROTC
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
In a rather unusual mural game
at the Pavilion last night the Delta
Chi I quintet staved off a late NRO
TC rally to pull out a 27-25 vic
tory.
Feature of the game was the long
scoring drought each team suffered.
The NROTC went 17 minutes with
out hitting from the court, while
the Delta Chi's failed to score a
basket in the last 12 minutes of
play.
Throughout the beginning of the
second half, they continued to pour
it on as they piled up a 2P> to 1(J lead,
but with eight minutes gone, Jim
Young's one-bander was the last
field goal they put in.
Allen Fields scored on a lay-up
to finally break the dearth of NRO
TC baskets, and then two more
by Dan Heil cut the margin to four
points. Tom Terry put in a foul
for the Delta Chi's last f>oint with
five minutes left.
In their last-ditch attempt to pull

the game out, Don Bale hit a set
.shot for the Navy to make the score
27 to 24. After a foul shot by Hugh
Bradley, the Middies got possession
of the ball three times in the last
three minutes even though the
Delta Chi's put on a freeze, but
they cuold not put the ball in.
In other mural action last night,
DU II took a close 30 to 2(> victory
from Phi Psi 11. Marty Spellman
led the winners with 12 points.
