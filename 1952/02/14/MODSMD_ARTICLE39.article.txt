# Cards to Face Bruins
## UCLA Match To Be Crucial 
### DICK KLEIN 
Bob Burnett put his varsity
cagers through a last, hard prac
tice yesterday afternoon. It was
termed "good all the way
around." There will be only a
light workout today with no
scrimmaging.
The Indian quintet will play
their most important weekend
doubleheader starting tomorrow
night. It's a two - game series
.'•cain.st the UCLA Bruins in the
Pavilion. The Cards, currently
riding in the Southern Division
cellar, are only two games be
hind the pace-setting Berkeley
Bears. Obviously, any loss on
the home courts will put a big
damper on title aspirations.
Adding plenty of zip and scor
ing punch to the first string, Paul
Johnson continues to show ter
rific form at guard after dov/ning
a bad case of jaundice. Other
change in the Card lineup from
the team that split with the
Bruins in their own Westwood
gym, will be a Walsh - Tomsic
switch.
Jim, voted Northern Califor
nia's eager of the week, has been
moved to forward to give the In
dians more height on the boards.
He has done extremely well at
the new post, scoring more
paints and clearing a good share
of rebounds. Ron Tomsic, the
sensational fro h, has maintained
his scoring ability at the guard
position.
Jim Ramstead and Eddie
Tucker round out the starting
five. Both were particularly
sharp in yesterday's scrimmage.
Burnett has Dave Epperson, Don
DeLong, Olie Suzdaleff, Bruce
Iver.en, and George Zaninovich.
This slow - breaking outfit has
been very effective in recent

games and should prove valuable
in the second half of the Division
play.
After the full court scrimmage
moct of the team took a full

brace of free throw shots and
then several inbound plays were
worked on. A long period of
time was workd on late - game
freeze tactics.


UCLA FRESHMAN STALWART—Don Bragg from San Fran
cisco will be one of the Bruin regulars tcmorrow night when
the Uclans take the floor against the Cards.

ing punch to the first string, Paul
Johnson continues to show ter
rific form at guard after dov/ning
a bad case of jaundice. Other
change in the Card lineup from
the team that split with the
Bruins in their own Westwood
gym, will be a Walsh - Tomsic
switch.
Jim, voted Northern Califor
nia's eager of the week, has been
moved to forward to give the In
dians more height on the boards.
He has done extremely well at
the new post, scoring more
paints and clearing a good share
of rebounds. Ron Tomsic, the
sensational fro h, has maintained
his scoring ability at the guard
position.
Jim Ramstead and Eddie
Tucker round out the starting
five. Both were particularly
sharp in yesterday's scrimmage.
Burnett has Dave Epperson, Don
DeLong, Olie Suzdaleff, Bruce
Iver.en, and George Zaninovich.
This slow - breaking outfit has
been very effective in recent

games and should prove valuable
in the second half of the Division
play.
After the full court scrimmage
moct of the team took a full

brace of free throw shots and
then several inbound plays were
worked on. A long period of
time was workd on late - game
freeze tactics.


UCLA FRESHMAN STALWART—Don Bragg from San Fran
cisco will be one of the Bruin regulars tcmorrow night when
the Uclans take the floor against the Cards.
