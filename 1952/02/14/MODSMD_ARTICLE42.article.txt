## Card Swimmers to Open Season With SJS Tonight 
### JIM MADISON 
The Card swimmers will trek to San Jose tonight to open their
1952 season against San Jose State in the Spartan plunge. The
dual meet will begin at 8.
Tom Haynie's men have been training vigorously for the past
month with their eyes on the NCAA meet at Princeton at the end

|of March. Stanford rates a definite*
j threat for fourth- or third-place
I honors in this meet against such
I powerful squads as Yale, Ohio
j State, Michigan, and Michigan State.
Thus far in practice the mermen
have, for the most part, not b£en
| clocked at their competitive events,
| working out instead with yards and
yards of swimming for stroke and
series of timed conditioning sprints.
The few time trials held have
ranked with the best in the coun
try.
Haynie has under his tutelage an
abundance of good swimmers and is
finding that his biggest problem,
other than conditioning, is shuffling
them around to see who fits in best
where.
For this reason he will hold some
men out of their best events against
State .using others to see how well
they do.
The crew of swift sprint paddlers
of Jim Gaufthran, Bob Wycoff,
Bruce Putnam, Bert Holiday, Phil
I Chapman, Bob Thompson, and
more, all of whose times for the
I hundred are in the low fifties, will
j probably furnish a good lead on
i who's going to be really outstanding
this year.

Stanford entries in tonight's meet
will probably include:
Medley relay—Larry Heim, Bob
Frojen, and Jim Gauglvian
2211—80b Thompson, Don 0.-Jiorn
BreaststroUe—Ashley Jones, Fro
jen
50—Bob Wycoff, Jim Gunnerson
Diving—Bill Glathe, John Miller

Thus far in practice the mermen
have, for the most part, not b£en
| clocked at their competitive events,
| working out instead with yards and
yards of swimming for stroke and
series of timed conditioning sprints.
The few time trials held have
ranked with the best in the coun
try.
Haynie has under his tutelage an
abundance of good swimmers and is
finding that his biggest problem,
other than conditioning, is shuffling
them around to see who fits in best
where.
For this reason he will hold some
men out of their best events against
State .using others to see how well
they do.
The crew of swift sprint paddlers
of Jim Gaufthran, Bob Wycoff,
Bruce Putnam, Bert Holiday, Phil
I Chapman, Bob Thompson, and
more, all of whose times for the
I hundred are in the low fifties, will
j probably furnish a good lead on
i who's going to be really outstanding
this year.
