# THE 						DU PONT DIGEST
## Ch. E's at Du Pont The 						fields of research and development invite ingenuity of the chemical engineer 
### 
Research and development work in
chemical engineering often overlap
at Du Pont, except where the re
search is fundamental.
The chemical engineer occupied
with fundamental research is chiefly
concerned with basic studies of unit
operations and processes involving
reaction kinetics, thermodynamic
properties of fluids, high - pressure
techniques, equilibrium studies, heat
transfer and the like. Such studies
often lead to lower-cost manufactur
ing processes. Some recent projects
in fundamental research have been:
1. A study of fluidized catalyst re
action units including degree of fluid
at ion, temperature uniformity, cata
lyst activity and life, and conversion
of feed gases.
2. Studies of the fundamental trans
fer relations between phases, for in
stance, gas and liquid, in reacting
ma terials.
Apart from the chemical engineers
engaged in fundamental research,

there are many groups working in
applied research and development.
In fact, this is the major part of the
chemical engineering work done at
Du Pont. Here are examples of the
literally hundreds of unusual prob
lems they have solved:
1. Designing equipment for produc
ing pure silicon at 1000° C. (Though
one of the starting compounds is
highly corrosive, only spectroscopic
traces of impurities can be tolerated.)
2. Developing a high-pressure liquid
phase process to replace the stand
ard dry method of producing sodium
azide formerly employed.
3. Designing a continuous flow, gas
liquid reactor for use in making a
fiber intermediate under pressure.
4. Developing, from laboratory re
search results, a process for large
scale production of complex poly
meric materials used in the manu
facture of color photographic film.
These examples can only hint the
variety and originality of problems

constantly arising at Du Pont. They
indicate the challenge as well as thr?
broad opportunity awaiting the taf
ents and ingenuity of the young
chemical engineer who wants a ca
reer in research and development-
