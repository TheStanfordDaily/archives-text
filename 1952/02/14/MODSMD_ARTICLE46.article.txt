# Wanted: Hashers---and the Faculty Apply
## 
### 
Close your eyes. Think of the professor who teaches your 9
o'clock. In his gray suit. Very dignified. Ever think how he'd
look in a hasher's white coat —waiting on a table full of girls?
Someone on Drives Committee obviously did, because three
living groups will have faculty hashers at one meal next week,

alter the current Foreign Relief
Drive ends. The living groups who
give the most per capita in each of
three divisions, will rate the faculty
scrvicc.
Some of the faculty members in
volved wrote applications for their
jobs. Here are some samples:

Amalgamated and Associated
House Mothers, Local 402
Attention: Chief Gargoyle
Dear Madam:
I am a teacher of Business Law.
My doctor says I got to have a
change. I sure would like to hash

The Kapna Sijfs have a new ap
proach to (he relief drive — they
have instituted a swear word cup.
Kappa Sig brothers conate from
10 cents to 25 cents per swear
word, according to the magnitude
of the word.
The fraternity is also having a
special Sunday hrunch, with each
man paying for his meal. In
charge of these activities arc Hud
Nutting, Pete Lyon, and Doug
Perry.

where there is lots of girls. I figure
when they're eating they ain't talk
ing and they ain't knitting, and, Lord
knows, I've had enough of both in
my classes.
I've had business experiences. I
used to work on Shrimpboats but

there was too much hurry, hurry.
I also sold baby books. But.if you
ain't got a baby, you don't need a
book, and if you got the baby, you
ain't got time to read. I'm just tell
ing you this to show I been around.
I can set a table peachy dandy. I
know some hashers swipe the cherry
of! the bread pudding between the
kitchen and dining room and then
blame the cook. Not me. I'm de
pendable.
Sure hope you can use me. .Tem
porary like, I'm living near 3rd and
Howard in San Francisco. If you
need me just ask any of the boys
around the corner. They all know
me.
Yours respectively,
Carl Running

I
Unfortunately, I cannot give you
any references regarding my special
skills as hasher because none of the
people whom I have previously
served in this capacity are now alive.
However, I assure you that I put
everything I have into any job I
undertake.
By way of related experience, I
have worked four years as a shoe
salesman. In eighteen months I
worked my way up from the Bargain
to Ladies Novelties on the second
floor. I am prepared to make the
same approach to this job.
H. Donald Winbigler
Dean of Students

I do not claim training or experi
ence as a hasher but if a good waiter
is desired I can qualify—and how!

I wait on my family!
Although I sometimes cuss while
I wait, nevertheless I wait.
No need to mention the length of
experience—l've had plenty!
Dr. Graham Stuart
Professor of Political Science

I wish to apply for a post as a
hasher and ask special consideration.
Meat I seldom see, and the oppor
tunity to be where meat is affects
me. The Testing Center says I am
peculiarly fitted for the specialized
work you offer. I read menus in
several languages, am ambidexterous,
and have done similar work in the
San Francisco "300" where I learned
the first principles of hashing—serv
ice with a smile and keep a respect
ful distance from the customers. I
promise, if hired, to uphold the dig
nity, standards, and efficiency of that
distinguished fraternity — the Stan
ford Hashers.
Reverend Robert Minto
Chaplain, Stanford Chapel
