## 
### 
Following a brief discussion, de
cision on the proposed formal affili
ation wi'h the Free University of
Berlin was postponed indefinitely
by the ASSU Excom last night.
George Denny moved that fur
ther discussion and the final deci
sion again be deferred when it v/as
learned that the formal letter of
affiliation was not yet prepared for
presentation to the Executive Com
mittee.
The Excom representatives in
general felt that there should also
be a greater sampling of student
opinion before the final decision is
made. Graduate representative Dave
Curry suggested specifically that
there be more public discussion on
the question.
Other Excom actions included:
1. A report given by Bob Rotlolf
on the plans for the Student Work
shop which will be held March 8
in the Women's Clubhouse. The
general theme of the program will
be "Difficulties Which Organizations
on Campus Find Within Them
selves and Willi Other Organiza
tions."
2. A report from Jackie Harris
on the progress of the current
charity drive.
3. A report from Conrad von Bi
bra, president of the lIR, on his
recent trip to the New York UNES
CO Conference.
4. The appropriation of $000 from
the contingency fund for the rcdec
oration of the Excom room.
5. A preliminary report from the
Committee on the Reorganization of
the lIR. The final report will be
