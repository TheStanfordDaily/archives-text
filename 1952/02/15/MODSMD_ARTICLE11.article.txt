# Alley Issues GOP Ban Clarification
## 
### 
ASSU President Wayne Alley
issued (In* following statement
yesterday on Excom's decision on
(lie Young Republican issue, in
answer to a specific question as,ked
in a letter appearing in Campus
Opinion, page !2:
Because the personnel on Excom
is different each year, precedent is
less important than in most organi
zations. It is the feeling of this par
ticular Excom that there is a better
approach to increasing interest and
fostering education politically than
the chartering of partisan groups.
The Excom this year acted in
good conscience; the Excom which
chartered the Student Federalists
did :,o also. The Stanford Student
Federalists are not linked constitu
tionally with any national organi
zation and are under no obligations
to operate within a predetermined
frame of reference. If the actions
of the two Excoms involved are
contradictory, the contradiction is
legitimate.
