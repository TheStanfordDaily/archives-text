# Student Playwrights Display Note of Protest in One-Act Plays
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
Perhaps the mo:.I interesting
point about the Ram's Head One-
Acts, which opened a three-day
run in the I.itlle Theater last eve
ning, is the n6te of protest struck
in each of the three plays. In
terms that ire violent, whimsical,
and angry, respectively, three
student playwrights examine
and evaluate various manners
and attitudes of modern life.
F. Stewart Joblyn brings reason
and emotion into conflict in "Red
Sky at Night," a story of the shore
patrol. Il is not difficult to raise
the discord between the usually ra
tional Lt. Anderson (Hal Burdick
Jr.) and the brutal Rocky Vancssi
(Ned Hutchinson) to a more uni
versal level—specifically, war. Vio
lence, we see, can breed only vio
lence and, ultimately, self-destrue
tion.
Oft to a good start with a gen
uinely atmospheric poker game,
"Red Sky" unfortunately hits the

downward (rail thereafter. The
climax, while not unmotivated,
seems implausible; Rocky suc
cumbs all too easily after what
we have been led to expect from
him. Even so, an entirely con
vincing performance by Boh Lee
as Gilbert and generally good act
ing by the rest of the cast keep
"Red Skv" on its feet until its
closing moments.
In "Turn Down an Empty Glass,"
Pat Foster reverses the idea that art
is the true life and that all else
is shallow and superficial. For
what they are, a dealer who whips
up his own antiques (Dick Win
ter) and a bored society girl (wood
enly enacted by Lynn Atterbury)
are the real people. The rest of the
stage io populated with hilariously
nightmarish fantasies in the beings
of a painter, a composer, a poet—
and a drunk.
Divertingly conceived, the play
smploys almost every form of hu
mor imaginable, and behind this lies
some serious criticism of the pseu
do-arty 'ct. But the over-all effect
u practically schizoid. Director Ted
Shank seems unsure of what he is
aiming for, and fails in matters of
unity. Regardless, Miss Foster has
written enough funny lines to carry
an amusing, if not completely
production.
'I he evening's piece de resis

tance is Ward Tanzcr's slashirg
indictment of American mora? •,
particularly with regard to mar
riage, in "Passage to Rome." Tb -

A sub-plot focusing on a lecher
ous ship inspector (Hugo Mel--
chione) and an innocent Tahitiau
girl (Buzzy Damrosh) nicely print,
up the purity and beauty of tbn
major relationships. Complement A
by excellent performances f'om t'n
whole cast, "Passage" is a tnily oU
perior and significant drama, ■•ell
staged for all its angry power by
Dolores Abrams.
