# Partisan Politics at Stanford
## 
### 
The much-debated question of approving a
constitution for the Young Republicans as an
official, on-campus Stanford group came to a
surprise climax Wednesday night when Excom
withdrew its quarter-old recommendation ot
approval to the Board of Trustees. We say
climax because the about-face action effectively
kilb the possibility of partisan groups on cam
pus in the forseeable future.
Already considerable criticism has been
voiced against Excom's decision, (see Campus
Opinion below).
We think Excom acted wisely. In taking its
action, it went on record as strongly favoring
some sort of set-up whereby speakers on poli
tical issues can be presented. Further, it ap
pointed a committee to study the problem and
make recommendations.
Excom representatives favorably discussed
such possibilities as forum programs arranged
through the Committee on Public Exercises
aided by a student group to present speakers
on controversial issues.
The problem is one of method and of focus.
It is Excom's feeling that Stanford's alleged
"ivory tower" tradition is out of step with the
times. It feels some sort of program for stimu
lating student interest in politics is highly de
sirable, but that this can be best accomplished
by means other than through partisan organiza
tions. In other words, the emphasis is on edu
cation rather than propaganda.
What would happen if the Young Republi
cans v/ere given the go-ahead as a campus
group?
Ideally, it would lead to the chartering of a
similar organization of Young Democrats. The
two, and any others, could work harmoniously
to present political speakers; all sides of issues

would come out, student interest would be
stimulated, and a valuable educational function
accomplished. Ideally.
But where political groups are involved, the
result might be far off center from the ideal.
The very strong possibility of partisan tenden
cies, active campaigning, pressure, propaganda
come into the picture, and we doubt if this is
desirable at an educational institution.
Then there is the ever-present problem of
Communist organizations, of "where to draw
the line." Would they be excluded? Could
they be excluded? Probably. But there is a
strong case for the "if you allow one you have
to allow all" school of thought.
Programs set up by the Committee on Public
Exercises, for example, working with a student
group, we feel would corrie closer to providing
political education than programs provided by
partisan groups.
And there is no reason programs of this kind
need be "watered down," as a letter below sug
gests. It is a matter of securing speakers who
have partisan convictions, who are not them
selves "watered down." To suggest that such
speakers could be provided only through an
organization of partisan groups, to us, doesn't
make sense.
It is important, however, that students work
with the Public Exercises Committee. At pres
ent there is no student representation.
Regardless of what form the recommenda
tions of Excom's special committee take —
whether they recommend programs arranged
by Public Ex. or another agency, Stanford at
least would be taking a sizable step down from
its position in the "ivory tower." Allowing par
tisan groups to organize on campus might well
turn out to be a head-long plunge.

such possibilities as forum programs arranged
through the Committee on Public Exercises
aided by a student group to present speakers
on controversial issues.
The problem is one of method and of focus.
It is Excom's feeling that Stanford's alleged
"ivory tower" tradition is out of step with the
times. It feels some sort of program for stimu
lating student interest in politics is highly de
sirable, but that this can be best accomplished
by means other than through partisan organiza
tions. In other words, the emphasis is on edu
cation rather than propaganda.
What would happen if the Young Republi
cans v/ere given the go-ahead as a campus
group?
Ideally, it would lead to the chartering of a
similar organization of Young Democrats. The
two, and any others, could work harmoniously
to present political speakers; all sides of issues

would come out, student interest would be
stimulated, and a valuable educational function
accomplished. Ideally.
But where political groups are involved, the
result might be far off center from the ideal.
The very strong possibility of partisan tenden
cies, active campaigning, pressure, propaganda
come into the picture, and we doubt if this is
desirable at an educational institution.
Then there is the ever-present problem of
Communist organizations, of "where to draw
the line." Would they be excluded? Could
they be excluded? Probably. But there is a
strong case for the "if you allow one you have
to allow all" school of thought.
Programs set up by the Committee on Public
Exercises, for example, working with a student
group, we feel would corrie closer to providing
political education than programs provided by
partisan groups.
And there is no reason programs of this kind
need be "watered down," as a letter below sug
gests. It is a matter of securing speakers who
have partisan convictions, who are not them
selves "watered down." To suggest that such
speakers could be provided only through an
organization of partisan groups, to us, doesn't
make sense.
It is important, however, that students work
with the Public Exercises Committee. At pres
ent there is no student representation.
Regardless of what form the recommenda
tions of Excom's special committee take —
whether they recommend programs arranged
by Public Ex. or another agency, Stanford at
least would be taking a sizable step down from
its position in the "ivory tower." Allowing par
tisan groups to organize on campus might well
turn out to be a head-long plunge.
The much-debated question of approving a
constitution for the Young Republicans as an
official, on-campus Stanford group came to a
surprise climax Wednesday night when Excom
withdrew its quarter-old recommendation ot
approval to the Board of Trustees. We say
climax because the about-face action effectively
kilb the possibility of partisan groups on cam
pus in the forseeable future.
Already considerable criticism has been
voiced against Excom's decision, (see Campus
Opinion below).
We think Excom acted wisely. In taking its
action, it went on record as strongly favoring
some sort of set-up whereby speakers on poli
tical issues can be presented. Further, it ap
pointed a committee to study the problem and
make recommendations.
Excom representatives favorably discussed
