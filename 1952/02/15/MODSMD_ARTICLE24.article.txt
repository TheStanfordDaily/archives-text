HAS SPRING SPRUNG?
Come fill the cup. and in the fire of Spring,
Your winter-garment of repentance fling ...
—Omar Khayyam
Just smell the air! Could it be that spring is on
the way? Technically it won't begin until March 21,
but I wonder if Stanford isn't jumping the gun a bit.
True, the weather is spotty. One day it rains; the
next the sun comes out. Excorn goes into a big huddle
and decides to open the lake but a thunder clap vetoes
the idea and they return to the v>n-•- " — n

issue. The tops on convertibles
are cracking with all this up and
down stuff. The girls are writing
home for their summer cottons.
The volley ball courts are drying
up and as V-ball begins the grade
points begin to slip.
The lawn out in front of the
main libe resembles a picnic
grounds on the sunny days. It's
fun to watch some good inten
tioned student carry a book from

the reserve book room and sit on the grass to "study."
He opens the musty volume and tries to concen
trate. But it's no good. The memory of other springs
fill his mind and soon lie's looking beyond the sand
stone buildings, beyond the printed page, beyond the
present. And he rolls over on his back like a har
pooned whale and just basks for a while in the good
sun and shortly falls asleep. A happy grin on his
face; a bug playing hop-scotch on his book.
If you were out at Rossolti's last Friday afternoon,
you know what I mean about an early spring. From*
the cigarette machine to the player piano, from the
crcek to Alpine Road, the joint was stacked. The
tables looked like overcrowded lifeboats and the
ground like a beer truck had turned over. The air

was sweet in (he smell of new grass and garlic
bread. A robin chirped happily at the throng be
low until someone dispatched him southbound by
hocking a beer bottle in his direction. (I've never
seen a more hurt look on a robin's face in all my
life.)
To see the happy—ever growing happier—bunch
out at old Rossot's wouldn't make anyone call this
the "silent generation." You can tell time by the
noise out in the picnic grounds. At three o'clock you
can almost hear the creek over the sound of the
swallowing. At four o'clock the crowd begins to
arrive and the phrase you hear most is, "Just a quick
break before I get back to the books." By five o'clock
the place sounds like we're on the one-foot line in
the Rose Bowl. By five-thirty you'd think we'd won
the Rose Bowl. By six o'clock everyone is convinced
we did.
"It must be the weather," says John, the new owner
as he and his four husky sons shovel the money into
the wheelbarrows until the armored car from the
Bank of America can come.
Another sign of impending spring is the rash of
pinnings. (A word which comes to us from a
wrestling term which means, "To render one's op
ponent completely helpless by affixing him firmly
to the floor by any means possible.") In one house
last Monday night there were live pinnings. What
was playing at the Sunday night Hicks anyway?
Must have been a war picture. Or maybe a convict
film.
The library hod to lay off a couple of the extra
girls. Business had sloughed olf so much that they
weren't making enough in fines to even keep the
University going.
If spring is a time of the year, we've still got a way
to go. But if spring is an attitude, then indeed —
Spring Has Sprung.

the place sounds like we're on the one-foot line in
the Rose Bowl. By five-thirty you'd think we'd won
the Rose Bowl. By six o'clock everyone is convinced
we did.
"It must be the weather," says John, the new owner
as he and his four husky sons shovel the money into
the wheelbarrows until the armored car from the
Bank of America can come.
Another sign of impending spring is the rash of
pinnings. (A word which comes to us from a
wrestling term which means, "To render one's op
ponent completely helpless by affixing him firmly
to the floor by any means possible.") In one house
last Monday night there were live pinnings. What
was playing at the Sunday night Hicks anyway?
Must have been a war picture. Or maybe a convict
film.
The library hod to lay off a couple of the extra
girls. Business had sloughed olf so much that they
weren't making enough in fines to even keep the
University going.
If spring is a time of the year, we've still got a way
to go. But if spring is an attitude, then indeed —
Spring Has Sprung.

HAS SPRING SPRUNG?
Come fill the cup. and in the fire of Spring,
Your winter-garment of repentance fling ...
—Omar Khayyam
Just smell the air! Could it be that spring is on
the way? Technically it won't begin until March 21,
but I wonder if Stanford isn't jumping the gun a bit.
True, the weather is spotty. One day it rains; the
next the sun comes out. Excorn goes into a big huddle
and decides to open the lake but a thunder clap vetoes
the idea and they return to the v>n-•- " — n

issue. The tops on convertibles
are cracking with all this up and
down stuff. The girls are writing
home for their summer cottons.
The volley ball courts are drying
up and as V-ball begins the grade
points begin to slip.
The lawn out in front of the
main libe resembles a picnic
grounds on the sunny days. It's
fun to watch some good inten
tioned student carry a book from

the reserve book room and sit on the grass to "study."
He opens the musty volume and tries to concen
trate. But it's no good. The memory of other springs
fill his mind and soon lie's looking beyond the sand
stone buildings, beyond the printed page, beyond the
present. And he rolls over on his back like a har
pooned whale and just basks for a while in the good
sun and shortly falls asleep. A happy grin on his
face; a bug playing hop-scotch on his book.
If you were out at Rossolti's last Friday afternoon,
you know what I mean about an early spring. From*
the cigarette machine to the player piano, from the
crcek to Alpine Road, the joint was stacked. The
tables looked like overcrowded lifeboats and the
ground like a beer truck had turned over. The air

was sweet in (he smell of new grass and garlic
bread. A robin chirped happily at the throng be
low until someone dispatched him southbound by
hocking a beer bottle in his direction. (I've never
seen a more hurt look on a robin's face in all my
life.)
To see the happy—ever growing happier—bunch
out at old Rossot's wouldn't make anyone call this
the "silent generation." You can tell time by the
noise out in the picnic grounds. At three o'clock you
can almost hear the creek over the sound of the
swallowing. At four o'clock the crowd begins to
arrive and the phrase you hear most is, "Just a quick
break before I get back to the books." By five o'clock
the place sounds like we're on the one-foot line in
the Rose Bowl. By five-thirty you'd think we'd won
the Rose Bowl. By six o'clock everyone is convinced
we did.
