# CAMPUS OPINION
## Decision on Young GOP's Questioned 
### 
To the Editor:
"Political action is undesirable at Stanford." And
why is it, I'd like to know?
I was shocked to read in this morning's Daily of
Excom's final and complete rejection of the Young
Republicans from campus, and with them all other
political gro«ps. With the rejection went a watered
down pacification of speaker forums that would
investigate political issues, without, of course, went
the implication, being "partisan," and thus educate
students. As far as I am concerned, there is nothing
like an objective speaker forum to quiet the least
stirring of interest in any kind of action at all.
Excom's attitude runs counter to the whole point
of education, it seems to me. Here we are, sup
posedly the most highly trained, mentally, and most
well informed In our society, and yet we are not
felt able to cope with the incitement of a partisan
political viewpoint.
What will happen to the sheltered Stanfordite when
out in the big world of parties? He will probably
join one. Well, why not have a taste of the partisan
now? We are not children to be protected and said
"no" to by a motherly Excom with barely an expla
nation. A student trained to think inadequately, as
we are told over and over we are, can maintain order
in his cerebrum under the onslaught of exciting ideas.
Perhaps, to face the thing squarely, Hxcotn is
trembling in it's boots at the prospect of a red in
vasion. The Communist party would sidle in after
the less frightening Republicans and make an awful
furor. Well, I would like to meet a Communist.
I'd like to see one, hear one speak, and argue with
one, •
I think it is a mistake to keep political issues on
a purely objective, intellectual plane: i,e. in the hand?

of nonpartisan speaker forums. I know, it. is the ideal
that reason must be unclouded by emotion, but you'll
never have an idea without a viewpoint or an emo
tional charge behind it, not an idea that will hold
anybody's interest for very long.
