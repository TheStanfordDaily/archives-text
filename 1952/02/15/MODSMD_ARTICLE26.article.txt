# GOP's Compared to UWF
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I just read with great interest your article of Feb. 14
reporting Excom's action on the Young GOP group.
I am unable to understand the conservative—almost
reactionary atmosphere which pervades our Executive
Committee and campus. However, I realize I have
not been sufficiently informed to judge impartially
myself.
The burning question I have is "How on this
campus did the United World Federalists obtain
approval by Excom, when a group of active, con
scientous Young Republicans are not welcomed?"
Most campuses would follow exactly the opposite
move.
According to Excom "the three objects of a par
tisian group (are) education, civic information, and
political action . . . and the third, political action,
is undesirable at Stanford." What student group on
any campus is as politically dynamic as the UWF
movement, and probably does less as far as educa
tion and civic information is concerned? This is not
presented as a challenge to Excom or the presiding
officer, just a question I would appreciate an answer
to.
