# WOMEN'S COUNCIL
## Demerit Plan in 4th Year 
### BARBARA DOWNS 
Today marks the beginning of the
fourth year of the demerit system
for Stanford women students under
women's social regulations.
The present system was origi
nated by Women's Council and
AWS in 1949. It was presented to
the women for approval and was
passed by an overwhelming ma
jority. The system provided an en
tirely new method of handling vio
lations and penalties, replacing the
former system of lock-ins, fines, and
other penalties.
Under the former plan, women
appeared before their respective
house committee for every viola
tion. The committee levied fines or
other penalties and gave each girl
a lecture. If the violations mounted
too high, the house committee then
referred the student to Women's
Council for final action.
There was no uniformity in the
previous system. Under the revised
plan, demerits' accumulate through
the student's undergraduate years.
She appears before Women's Coun
cil if her demerits have reached the
probation level of four or the sus
pension level of five. All girls are
urged to appeal any case to the
Council at any demerit level.
The new system is liberal, and its

rules are uniform, campus - wide,
and simple. It enables every girl
to exercise her individual judgment
wisely. It presumes the ability of
every Stanford woman to exercise
greater responsibility in upholding
the social reeulations.
The demerit system is based on
an accumulation of technicals, lock
outs, and offenses. The present sen
ior class was the first class to try
out the new system. One hundred
seventeen present seniors of the
original freshman class of 1948-49
have no demerits, and G8 have one
or more. Eighty-five per cent of the
undergraduate women have less
than one demerit.
