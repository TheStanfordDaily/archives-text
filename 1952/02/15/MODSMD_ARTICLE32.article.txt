# Club to Hear Noted Quaker
## 
### 
Paul S. Cadbury, British indus
trialist and noted Quaker, will
speak at the Palo Alto Women's
Club tomorrow night at 8.
Cadbury is one of seven British
Quakers who spent two weeks in
the Soviet Union last summer. He
will talk about his observations
made while on this mission.
Cadbury is speaking under the
auspices of the American Friends
Service Committee. The public is
invited, and no admission will be
charged.
For 300 years Quakers have visit
ed every ruler in Russia, beginning
with Catherine the Great. The two
main objectives of this most recent
mission were to find out as much
as possible about conditions as they
are today in Russia and to try to
understand the problems of East-
West tension from the Russian point
of view.
