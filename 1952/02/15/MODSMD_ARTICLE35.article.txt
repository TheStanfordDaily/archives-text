# Baseballers Meet Paly Oaks in Opener
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
Stanford's baseball team plays its opening game of the year
tomorrow, as they host a strong Palo Alio Oaks team on the Sunken
Diamond. Game time is 2:30.
Indian Coach Everett Dean announced that Rog Osenbaugh
will start for the Varsity nine, and will hurl three innings. Bob

Murphy and Phil Page will each then
pitch three frames to finish the game.
Pulo Alto may have a slight ad-

vantage over the Indians in that they
belong to a winter league and have
six former Stanford players on their

, team. While the Varsity has been
| in training only a short while, the
Oaks have played a large number of
j games already this season.
Player-manager of the visitors is
; Monty Pfyl. A former Stanford play
i er, he coaches and plays second base.
Palo AI tn Loaded
Pfyl said yesterday that Bob Mur
j phy (no relation to the Indian hur
! ler of the same name) will lead off
jin center field. Murphy has played
in both the Pioneer anil the State
i leagues. He will be followed by Jack
j Holmquist, Oregon shortstop. Pfyl
will bat third.
In the clean-up position will be
Dick Stewart, Modesto slugger, who
j will play first base, following him
will be third basem? n Jim Mason,
j Catcher Dick Claig, left fielder
; Charlie Cole, now in law school, and
Pfyl's brother Frank, playing right
field, will bat next. All of these
I players, along with Mason, are for-
I mer Indian horsehiders.
Pitching for the visitors will be
Dave Duhle, also an alumnus and
currently with the Oakland Acorns.
Dahle should provide plenty of hurl

ins competition for the Stanford trio.
Many Cards to Play
A large number of players are
scheduled to see action for the In
dians. Leading off for the hosts will
either be Rich Scramaglia or Owen
Powell, who both play third base.
Art Abrahamson will play* at sec
ond base anrl bat next. Hitting third
will be center fielder Dick Cole.
Two catchers will alternate in the
clean-up position. Dick Corzine and

Jack Shepard will both see action.
Batting fifth will be left fielder Chuck

Essegian.
Dave Rosenkrantz and IL.I Skill
man will alternate in rirjht field anc'
hit sixth. The first base sack will
be covered by Ray Swartz and Ha
Hennesy. Warren Goodrich will stari
at shortstop, and Osenbaugh, Mur
phy, and Page will hurl for Stan
lord's Varsity.
Joe Chez Oat
The Indians will be handicapped
by the temporary loss of one of their
top hurlers, Joe Chez. Two seasons
ago Chez was vot *d the team's most
valuable player, and last year was
bothered by an attack of pneumonia.
An injury will prevent Chez from
seeing any action tomorrow. Though
he is currently working out with
the Varsity, coach Dean says he will
iot be available for active duty for
at least two more weeks.
Dean for many years was coach of
both the basketball and baseball
teams at Stanford. This year he
turned the hoop duties over to Bob
Burnett, in order that he may devote
more time to his diamond duties.
Two yea ,- s ago the Indian Varsity
won the C.1.8.A. championship. Last
season the Stanford team lost out to
the Trojans, despite the fact that
Shepard led the league in batting.
No Admission Charge
There will be no admission charge
to the game. Dean said he hopes for
a clear, warm day tomorrow, in order
that his players have a good chance
to show off their talents.

The contest is the first in a series
jf seven home practice games for
Stanford. Next week the Indians
jlay Fort Old and Moffett Field.
The J.V. team has yet to play its
initial contest. The squad has been
•ecently cut. Their first game is
next week on Friday, when they face
•sequoia High. The following day
they play against Commerce from
San Francisco.
