# Cards, UCLA In Vital Series
## 
### DICK KLEIN Daily Sports Editor 
Can the high - scoring, race
horsc Indians take a two-game
series from the even speedier
Bruins? Will Coach Bob Bur
nett's platoon innovation hold
down the red-hot Weslwooders?
Those are the questions most cage
fans want answered when they
watch the Stanford Indians match
buckets with the UCLA Bruins to
night and tomorrow night at the
local Pavilion. Both gam£s are
scheduled for 8 p.m. tipoff. Stan
ford students will be admitted free
with a student body card.
Interest is so keen that packed
houses are expected both nigh Us.
Fans who expect good seats in the
crowded Pavilion should arrive as
early as possible and take in the
Brave games.
The varsity games will settle
more than the above questions.
The Indians need a double win to
stay in the Southern Division
race, as they are two games be
hind the pace-setting Cal quintet
right now. And only six games
remain on the conference sched
ule.
It'll be "do-or-die" for the Bruins
too. Coach Johnny Wooden's crew
needs the wins just as much, so the
competition and spirit will be fast
and rugged all the way.
Biding high after good perform
ances against the Phillips Oilers, St.

Mary's, and Santa Clara, the Cards
arc ready for the big pui.li that must
begin now. Rated by most as the
best in the Southern loop, Stanford
had considerable trouble on the
road against conference foes. Now
the Burnettmen have five of the re
maining six games on the Pavilion
court.
UCLA has earned the monicker
"Firehouse Five" in the South
land. And it's well deserved.
They run their opponents to
death and, incidentally, have av
eraged over 64 points per game.
They've won 13 and lost eight,
and have a 3-3 record in league
play.
At times the youthful Bruins
have showed signs of greatness, los
ing <o Bradley by a single point and
dropping a closie to top-notch Illi
nois, 73 to 67, in the closing sec
onds. Against the Indians, the
Westwooders won handily in the
first encounter, 81 to 63. But the
next night the Cards bounced back
and broke the Weatwood gym jinx
by downing the Bruins, 73 to 71.
This was one of the very few looses
under Coach Wooden on their home
court.
Don Johnson, UCLA's rugged
guard and one of the two veteran
performers, holds the scoring hon
ors for his team. In 21 games, John
son has put in 202 points for a fairly
decent 9.6 average. His field goal
accuracy is a cool 39 per cent.
Two newcomers are right he
hind Johnson in the point-making
column. Soph guard Itttnnie Liv
ingston has averaged 9.5 points.
The San Francisco lad, forward
Don Bragg, is next in line with
a little better than J) points per
game. lion is only a freshman and
lias been playing tremendous ball
for UCI.A.
The other veteran and the other
forward is reliable and steady Jerry
Norman. He's a senior. Rounding
out the starting five is center John
P/loore, a big, muscular center slot
man. Really adding greatness to the
Bruin quintet, Moore; is a frosh
from the Midwest and can play for
ward when necessary.
Other WestwOoders slated to see
plenty of action are Mike Hibler,
rangy center, who was a starter at
the beginning of the season; Ron
Bane, rapidly developing forward
center, who was high point man
with 20 points in the last Bruin
game; and Bobby Pounds, fast,
shifty floorman and excellent drib
bler.
Coach Burnett will use the
starting five be used at the very
beginning of the season. There
has been a switch in positions,
l'ut it's the same team. Jim Rani
stead at center, Eddie Tucker and
Jimmy Walsh at forwards, and
Ron Toimic and Paul Johnson at
guards.
John on, not to be confused with
Bruin Johnson, has really come
back from the sick-bay in grand
style. He adds plenty of scoring
punch. Now with Walsh at the for
ward post, the Indians are doing a
little better on the boards. Walsh
can bucket plenty too, and off his
recent showings was voted Northern
California's outstanding taskelball
er for last week.
On the slow-breaking, defensive
minded second platoon will be
hooking - leaping iJave Epperson,
Olie Suzdaleff, Don DeLong, George
Zaninovich, and Bruce Iversen. This
combo has been very effective and
the varsity plenty of valuable
rest. , , £

Mike plays behind UCLA's first
string pivot man, John Moore.
Mike, a 19-year-old sophomuve,
will see plenty of action in the
two-game series here. Between
Hibler and Moore, it appears Card
center Jim Ramstead will have
his work cut out for him.

TALL BUT NOT TOPS —Mike
Ilihler stands (i ft. 7 in. and oper
ates at center for the Bruins.
However, in spite of his height
Mike plays behind UCLA's first
string pivot man, John Moore.
Mike, a 19-year-old sophomuve,
will see plenty of action in the
two-game series here. Between
Hibler and Moore, it appears Card
center Jim Ramstead will have
his work cut out for him.
Can the high - scoring, race
horsc Indians take a two-game
series from the even speedier
Bruins? Will Coach Bob Bur
nett's platoon innovation hold
down the red-hot Weslwooders?
Those are the questions most cage
fans want answered when they
watch the Stanford Indians match
buckets with the UCLA Bruins to
night and tomorrow night at the
local Pavilion. Both gam£s are
scheduled for 8 p.m. tipoff. Stan
ford students will be admitted free
with a student body card.
Interest is so keen that packed
houses are expected both nigh Us.
Fans who expect good seats in the
crowded Pavilion should arrive as
early as possible and take in the
Brave games.
The varsity games will settle
more than the above questions.
The Indians need a double win to
stay in the Southern Division
race, as they are two games be
hind the pace-setting Cal quintet
right now. And only six games
remain on the conference sched
ule.
It'll be "do-or-die" for the Bruins
too. Coach Johnny Wooden's crew
needs the wins just as much, so the
competition and spirit will be fast
and rugged all the way.
Biding high after good perform
ances against the Phillips Oilers, St.

Mary's, and Santa Clara, the Cards
arc ready for the big pui.li that must
begin now. Rated by most as the
best in the Southern loop, Stanford
had considerable trouble on the
road against conference foes. Now
the Burnettmen have five of the re
maining six games on the Pavilion
court.
UCLA has earned the monicker
"Firehouse Five" in the South
land. And it's well deserved.
They run their opponents to
death and, incidentally, have av
eraged over 64 points per game.
They've won 13 and lost eight,
and have a 3-3 record in league
play.
At times the youthful Bruins
have showed signs of greatness, los
ing <o Bradley by a single point and
dropping a closie to top-notch Illi
nois, 73 to 67, in the closing sec
onds. Against the Indians, the
Westwooders won handily in the
first encounter, 81 to 63. But the
next night the Cards bounced back
and broke the Weatwood gym jinx
by downing the Bruins, 73 to 71.
This was one of the very few looses
under Coach Wooden on their home
court.
Don Johnson, UCLA's rugged
guard and one of the two veteran
performers, holds the scoring hon
ors for his team. In 21 games, John
son has put in 202 points for a fairly
decent 9.6 average. His field goal
accuracy is a cool 39 per cent.
Two newcomers are right he
hind Johnson in the point-making
column. Soph guard Itttnnie Liv
ingston has averaged 9.5 points.
The San Francisco lad, forward
Don Bragg, is next in line with
a little better than J) points per
game. lion is only a freshman and
lias been playing tremendous ball
for UCI.A.
The other veteran and the other
forward is reliable and steady Jerry
Norman. He's a senior. Rounding
out the starting five is center John
P/loore, a big, muscular center slot
man. Really adding greatness to the
Bruin quintet, Moore; is a frosh
from the Midwest and can play for
ward when necessary.
Other WestwOoders slated to see
plenty of action are Mike Hibler,
rangy center, who was a starter at
the beginning of the season; Ron
Bane, rapidly developing forward
center, who was high point man
with 20 points in the last Bruin
game; and Bobby Pounds, fast,
shifty floorman and excellent drib
bler.
Coach Burnett will use the
starting five be used at the very
beginning of the season. There
has been a switch in positions,
l'ut it's the same team. Jim Rani
stead at center, Eddie Tucker and
Jimmy Walsh at forwards, and
Ron Toimic and Paul Johnson at
guards.
John on, not to be confused with
Bruin Johnson, has really come
back from the sick-bay in grand
style. He adds plenty of scoring
punch. Now with Walsh at the for
ward post, the Indians are doing a

Mike, a 19-year-old sophomuve,
will see plenty of action in the
two-game series here. Between
Hibler and Moore, it appears Card
center Jim Ramstead will have
his work cut out for him.
Can the high - scoring, race

series from the even speedier
Bruins? Will Coach Bob Bur

down the red-hot Weslwooders?
Those are the questions most cage
fans want answered when they
watch the Stanford Indians match
buckets with the UCLA Bruins to
night and tomorrow night at the
local Pavilion. Both gam£s are
scheduled for 8 p.m. tipoff. Stan
ford students will be admitted free
with a student body card.
Interest is so keen that packed
houses are expected both nigh Us.
Fans who expect good seats in the
crowded Pavilion should arrive as
early as possible and take in the
Brave games.
The varsity games will settle
more than the above questions.
The Indians need a double win to
stay in the Southern Division
race, as they are two games be
hind the pace-setting Cal quintet
right now. And only six games
remain on the conference sched
ule.
It'll be "do-or-die" for the Bruins
too. Coach Johnny Wooden's crew
needs the wins just as much, so the
competition and spirit will be fast
and rugged all the way.
