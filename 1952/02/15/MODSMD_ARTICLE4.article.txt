# Cards, UCLA In Vital Series
## 
### DICK KLEIN Daily Sports Editor 
Can the high - scoring, race
horsc Indians take a two-game
series from the even speedier
Bruins? Will Coach Bob Bur
nett's platoon innovation hold
down the red-hot Weslwooders?
Those are the questions most cage
fans want answered when they
watch the Stanford Indians match
buckets with the UCLA Bruins to
night and tomorrow night at the
local Pavilion. Both gam£s are
scheduled for 8 p.m. tipoff. Stan
ford students will be admitted free
with a student body card.
Interest is so keen that packed
houses are expected both nigh Us.
Fans who expect good seats in the
crowded Pavilion should arrive as
early as possible and take in the
Brave games.
The varsity games will settle
more than the above questions.
The Indians need a double win to
stay in the Southern Division
race, as they are two games be
hind the pace-setting Cal quintet
right now. And only six games
remain on the conference sched
ule.
It'll be "do-or-die" for the Bruins
too. Coach Johnny Wooden's crew
needs the wins just as much, so the
competition and spirit will be fast
and rugged all the way.
Biding high after good perform
ances against the Phillips Oilers, St.

Mary's, and Santa Clara, the Cards
arc ready for the big pui.li that must
begin now. Rated by most as the
best in the Southern loop, Stanford
had considerable trouble on the
road against conference foes. Now
the Burnettmen have five of the re
maining six games on the Pavilion
court.
UCLA has earned the monicker
"Firehouse Five" in the South
land. And it's well deserved.
They run their opponents to
death and, incidentally, have av
eraged over 64 points per game.
They've won 13 and lost eight,
and have a 3-3 record in league
play.
At times the youthful Bruins
have showed signs of greatness, los
ing <o Bradley by a single point and
dropping a closie to top-notch Illi
nois, 73 to 67, in the closing sec
onds. Against the Indians, the
Westwooders won handily in the
first encounter, 81 to 63. But the
next night the Cards bounced back
and broke the Weatwood gym jinx
by downing the Bruins, 73 to 71.
This was one of the very few looses
under Coach Wooden on their home
court.
Don Johnson, UCLA's rugged
guard and one of the two veteran
performers, holds the scoring hon
ors for his team. In 21 games, John
son has put in 202 points for a fairly
decent 9.6 average. His field goal
accuracy is a cool 39 per cent.
Two newcomers are right he
hind Johnson in the point-making
