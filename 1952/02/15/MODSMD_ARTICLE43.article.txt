## 
### 
Zeta Psi paced by Sam Morely and
Ron Garver staved off a last half
rally to edge out a hard fighting
Kappa Sigma team 43-37 last night
in the Eneina Gym.
Leading 24-17 at the half, Zeta Psi
increased the margin to 35-22 mid
way through the second stanza, only
to see it slowly melt away to 41-37
just before the finish. Tom Revelly,
Gordy Galloway and Sterling Clay
ton sparked the spurt that put the
Kappa Sigs back in the ball game.
Morely was high for the winners
and the ball game with 15 followed
by Garver with 14. Clayton and Bob
Lucas were tops for the losers with
12 and 10 points respectively. Phi
Delts II won by forfeit over Beta 11.
