# Rugby Team To Face OC
## 
### 
Stanford's rugby team, 1950 Pa
cific Coast champs, and co-champs
with Cal in '51, will officially open
their season tomorrow when they
host the powerful Olympic Club.
The game will be played on the
rugby field ( JV football practice
field) and starting time Ls set for
2:30. No admission will be charged.
Holdovers from last year's,
squad combined with Hose Bowl
footballers turning out for the
sport help make this year's Card
squad another potential power.

Bonetti, Dick Borda, and Harry
Hunt, who starred for the Cards in
'50.
Forming the second rank are A 1
Kirkland, a starter last year, and
Len Mayrholer, the brilliant St.
Mary's transfer.
Norm Manoogian, Jesse Cone,
and Al Maimer round out the
starting scrum that averages 200
pounds per man. In the backfield
are Gordon Warnoch, Bill Ander
son, Sam Morley, Hon Cook, Dave
Mitten, Jim Stewart, and Don
Mueller.
Other ruggers who are slated to
see action include Bernie Tokarz,
Len Kapr.ielian, Paul Revak, How
ard Standifer, Dick Cornew, Dick
