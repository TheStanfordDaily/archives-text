# SENATOR NIXON SPEAKS
## 'Disaster' Confronts U.S. 
### HADLEY ROFF 
"We are headed lor national
disaster unless we frame new
foreign and domestic policies
soon," Senator Richard L. Nixon
(R., Calif.) warned a Lincoln Day
gathering in San Jose Wednes
day night.
Decrying America's loss of world
leadership since 1015, the young
legislator told how the Truman ad
ministration set up some of the
"greatest diplomatic failures in the
history of the world."
"Today we are the subjects of
international insults and blackmail,"
Nixon pointed out.
Blasting at the administration's
policies which have allowed "the
Soviets to claim 100 million new
subjects annually since 1945," Nixon
grimly declared that "today we are
fighting a duel for survival."
"No longer have we Iho strong

est army, the most effective tactical
air force, or the superior subma
rine fleet," Nixon said as he
blamed the Truman-Acheson pol
icies for leading the nation ' to
ard doom."
Claiming that the "Kremlin mas
ter minds" have gained a marked
manpower advantage over the West,
Nixon pointed out that the Russians
today have the manpower cards
stacked five to three against us.
"The odds were nine to one in out
favor six years ago," California's
junior Senator added.
The failure of the administration
to dam Communism's surge was

called "inexcusable." Reading from
the budgets of the Cold Wat years,
Nixon reported that more than 100
billion dollars has been appropri
ated for defense since World War 11.
"Yet," Nixon charged, "we had only
one and a half divisions ready for
combat when the Korean war broke
out.
A second failure among "the

greatest in world history," accord
ing to Nixon, has been the inability
of "gaining the real suport of allies
abroad."
The Senator also charged that
Amcrica is held in contempt by
enemy and allies alike because of
present corruption in government.
Calling on the Republican party
to define the issues of the coming
Presidential election, Nixon said,
"The Republican task is to drive
home the fact that there is an issue
more important to the individual
American than temporary tfiaterial
prosperity." The more important
issue, Nixon claimed, "is survival."
Saying that the Republican party
has yet to prove its ability to rule,
Nixon advised that the party should
adopt a "dynamic platform."
Suggesting a program, Nixon
outlined four points which he
considered essential to "any
American stand."
1. 'Ihe United Stales and her
allies mu .( remain militarily
slron;:.
2. The economy mu; l b«> kept
Mrong and free of socialistic en
croachment.
I!. The development of a fair,
sane, and effective program of in
ternal security.
1. The re-establishment of high
• tandarris of morality and integ
rity in Washington so that the
United States can effectively lead
(lie light in the ideological strug
gle.
Amplifying hi:; recommendations,
Nixon said that, military .strength in
the number of guns wasn't the only
important defense consideration. He
said that Russia has spread her ten
tacles without the loss of a single
soldier. What we must do, he said,
is study Russia's infiltration tech
niques in hopes of turning them
back upon the Kremlin.
On the economic situation, Nixon
advised that non-military expendi
tures should be "cut to the bone."
Further, he warned that "Republi
cans should not allow this emer
gency to be used to socialize any
basic American institution."
As final steps in his program he
advised that the government sweep
Communists and grafters out.

"We are headed lor national
disaster unless we frame new
foreign and domestic policies
soon," Senator Richard L. Nixon
(R., Calif.) warned a Lincoln Day
gathering in San Jose Wednes
day night.
Decrying America's loss of world
leadership since 1015, the young
legislator told how the Truman ad
ministration set up some of the
"greatest diplomatic failures in the
history of the world."
"Today we are the subjects of
international insults and blackmail,"
Nixon pointed out.
Blasting at the administration's
policies which have allowed "the
Soviets to claim 100 million new
subjects annually since 1945," Nixon
grimly declared that "today we are
fighting a duel for survival."
"No longer have we Iho strong

est army, the most effective tactical
air force, or the superior subma
rine fleet," Nixon said as he
blamed the Truman-Acheson pol
icies for leading the nation ' to
ard doom."
Claiming that the "Kremlin mas
ter minds" have gained a marked
manpower advantage over the West,
Nixon pointed out that the Russians
today have the manpower cards
stacked five to three against us.
"The odds were nine to one in out
favor six years ago," California's
junior Senator added.
The failure of the administration
to dam Communism's surge was

called "inexcusable." Reading from
the budgets of the Cold Wat years,
Nixon reported that more than 100
billion dollars has been appropri
ated for defense since World War 11.
"Yet," Nixon charged, "we had only
