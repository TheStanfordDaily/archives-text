TOKYO, Monday, Teh. IS (UI»)—
The Communists demanded today at
Panmunjom that the United Nations
command withdraw its veto of Rus
sia as one of the six neutral nations
that will supervise a Korean armi
stice.
A long bitter statement by Col.
Chang Chun San of the Communist
side branded as "intolerable" the UN
command's veto and said if Russia
could not be considered neutral in
the Korean war then no nation was
truly neutral.
Chang said Allied rejection of
Russia was an "unreasonable atti
tude which is indeed intolerable."
"Our side is firmly against this
unreasonable attitude of your side,"
lie stated.
