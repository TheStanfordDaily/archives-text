# Truman on UN
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Feb. 17 (UP)â€”Presi
dent Truman tonight blamed U.S.
failure to join the League of Na
tions for much of the world's pres
ent troubles.
In a message to the American As
sociation for the United Nations, the
President also blasted "men of little
faith'' who believe this country
should give up support of the UN.
In a brief statement of his belief
in the UN, Mr. Truman said the na
tion should have taken its place as
a world leader long ago.
"If we had lived up to our inter
national responsibilities as a nation
in the 1920'5, if we had joined the
League of Nations, much of the
tragedy and suffering of our gener
ation might well have been avoid
ed," he said.
Mr. Truman defended the record
of the UN, particularly the inter
vention in Korea, but warned that
it may face "new dangers" in the
years ahead.
