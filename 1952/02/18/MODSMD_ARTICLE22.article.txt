# Cards Lose, Then Win To Stay in PCC Cellar
## 
### DICK KLEIN Daily Sports Editor 
As the old saying goes, it just!
j "wasn't in the Cards." Stan- j
ford's game basketball squad
bounced back Saturday night
for a nifty 77 to 68 victory over
the UCLA Bruins. But the In
dians needed a double win, and
had lost Friday night's game,
72 to 68.
The split with the Bruins added to
the Cal-Southern Cal split, left the
conference standings unchanged. Un
changed except for the fact that two
more games have slipped by and only
four remain on the schedule. That
doesn't yive Boh Burnett and his
crew much leeway in collaring the
pace-setting Bears who are two
games up on the Cards.
The win Saturday night was a real
treat for the Pavilion crowd. The
| score was deadlocked 23-all at. the
j end of a quarter, and tied 42-all at
intermission time. During these fur
ious twenty minutes, neither team
managed to open up more than a
five-point gap. It was that close.
Eddie 'I ucker opened up the sec
j ond half with an amazing flurry.
! He missed his first shot from the
j floor but connected with the next,
j four, including three of his favorite
one-handed jump shots and a Bruin
breaking tip. Jim I'amstead added a
fantastic hook from way under the
backboard and Sudzaleff a free throw
to give the Cards a lead they never
I relinquished.
The third period ended with a (51
i to 57 count. George Zaninovich had
j replaced Tucker who was benching
it with four fouls. George was doing

very well on the boards and the
Cards seemed to have the Westwood
boys rattled. The four-point margin
still wasn't too big as the Bruins
were in command of the boards.
Mainly on the strength of sub
forward Ron Bane's marksmanship,
the Bruins tied up the score at 64-all
and 66-all. Then Tucker came
through again. I lis jump shot fol
lowed a tricky in bounds play. The
Cards grabbed the lead and were
never headed.
At 73 to 68, the Indians started tak
ing the ball out on all UCLA fouls.
During this string of fouls, the Cards
worked a play that had been tried
over and over again in practice. It
worked to perfection, with Olie Su/-
daleff looping the ball to Ronnie
Tomsic who was streaking for the
basket.. Ron dumped it. in on a
great driving lay-up. Score: 75 to 63.
With time running out the Cards
played a cool freeze which pro
duced a parade of Bruin fouls. The

It was a brilliant effort for Jim
Ramstead, Card captain and center.
The Rammer got away from Moore
and Ilibler easily and often in tally
ing his 24 points on a combination
ol hooks and stuffs. Ed Tucker
wasn't far ofT with a neat 17 digits.
Stanford's toy guards, Ron Tomsic
and Olie Sudzaleff, put in 14 and 13.
The Indian shooting eye was fairly
Eharp, hitting 4(> per cent from the
floor. They also netted 15 out of 25
free throws. This is far below their
normal total. The Bruins made good
cn 34 per cent of their shots.
UCLA was able to stay close
throughout (he game, mainly <in
their superior board control. John
Moore cleared the boards thirteen
times. All told the Bruins gathered
in II rebounds to 2!) for the Cards.
The night before it was a different
story. The South landers connected
with everything but the pleasure of
the Farm rooters. The Bruins reeled
off 13 quick points in a row to leap
in front 1(5 to 5. That was the ball
game right there, although the In
dian five and their screaming rooters'
never gave up.

during the first half. They left the
Pavilion court with a 42 to 33 lead.
Then were in command of the back
boards and were sailing along under

Card first-half performance was that
they committed only a paltry four
fouls in the twenty minutes.
In the last quarter the Cards
desperately closed the margin to
one point at *15 to (>•! and again at

Norman hit a lay-up, Johnson
(Don, that is) added a free throw
and Bragg dusted off the Cards
with a lay-up during a stall.
It was during this stall that Coach
Bob Burnett decided to let Ron
Tomsic take a loul shot. There was
something behind the snap decision,
too. The Bruins had orders to foul
and not allow the Cards a shot. By
taking the free throw, the Cards
could get a point up on the score
board and then try for a stolen ball
and a game-winning bucket.
If the free throw was missed. Bur
nett hoped for a Card tip or at least
Card possession. Thus, his decision
guve the Indians more scoring op
portunities. As it worked out, the
shot was missed and the Bruins
pulled down the rebound. And that
was the hope for tie, and the ball
game.
While Tucker, 23 points, and
Kamstead. 20, shared scoring hon
ors for Stanford, Don Johnson
paced the Bruins with IS. Norman
and Bragg bucketed lit for the
winners.

As the old saying goes, it just!
j "wasn't in the Cards." Stan- j
ford's game basketball squad
bounced back Saturday night
for a nifty 77 to 68 victory over
the UCLA Bruins. But the In
dians needed a double win, and
had lost Friday night's game,
72 to 68.
The split with the Bruins added to
the Cal-Southern Cal split, left the
conference standings unchanged. Un
changed except for the fact that two
more games have slipped by and only
four remain on the schedule. That
doesn't yive Boh Burnett and his
crew much leeway in collaring the
pace-setting Bears who are two
games up on the Cards.
The win Saturday night was a real
treat for the Pavilion crowd. The
| score was deadlocked 23-all at. the
j end of a quarter, and tied 42-all at
intermission time. During these fur
ious twenty minutes, neither team
managed to open up more than a
five-point gap. It was that close.
Eddie 'I ucker opened up the sec
j ond half with an amazing flurry.
! He missed his first shot from the
j floor but connected with the next,
j four, including three of his favorite
one-handed jump shots and a Bruin
breaking tip. Jim I'amstead added a
fantastic hook from way under the
backboard and Sudzaleff a free throw
to give the Cards a lead they never
I relinquished.
The third period ended with a (51
i to 57 count. George Zaninovich had
j replaced Tucker who was benching
it with four fouls. George was doing

very well on the boards and the
Cards seemed to have the Westwood
boys rattled. The four-point margin
still wasn't too big as the Bruins
were in command of the boards.
Mainly on the strength of sub
forward Ron Bane's marksmanship,
the Bruins tied up the score at 64-all
and 66-all. Then Tucker came
through again. I lis jump shot fol
lowed a tricky in bounds play. The
Cards grabbed the lead and were
never headed.
At 73 to 68, the Indians started tak
ing the ball out on all UCLA fouls.
During this string of fouls, the Cards
worked a play that had been tried
over and over again in practice. It
worked to perfection, with Olie Su/-
daleff looping the ball to Ronnie
Tomsic who was streaking for the
basket.. Ron dumped it. in on a
great driving lay-up. Score: 75 to 63.
With time running out the Cards
played a cool freeze which pro
duced a parade of Bruin fouls. The

As the old saying goes, it just!
j "wasn't in the Cards." Stan- j
ford's game basketball squad
bounced back Saturday night
for a nifty 77 to 68 victory over
the UCLA Bruins. But the In
dians needed a double win, and
had lost Friday night's game,
72 to 68.
The split with the Bruins added to
the Cal-Southern Cal split, left the
conference standings unchanged. Un
changed except for the fact that two
more games have slipped by and only
four remain on the schedule. That
doesn't yive Boh Burnett and his
crew much leeway in collaring the
pace-setting Bears who are two
games up on the Cards.
The win Saturday night was a real
treat for the Pavilion crowd. The
| score was deadlocked 23-all at. the
j end of a quarter, and tied 42-all at
intermission time. During these fur
ious twenty minutes, neither team
managed to open up more than a
five-point gap. It was that close.
Eddie 'I ucker opened up the sec
j ond half with an amazing flurry.
! He missed his first shot from the
j floor but connected with the next,
j four, including three of his favorite
one-handed jump shots and a Bruin
breaking tip. Jim I'amstead added a
fantastic hook from way under the
backboard and Sudzaleff a free throw
to give the Cards a lead they never
I relinquished.
The third period ended with a (51
i to 57 count. George Zaninovich had
j replaced Tucker who was benching
it with four fouls. George was doing

very well on the boards and the
Cards seemed to have the Westwood
boys rattled. The four-point margin
still wasn't too big as the Bruins
were in command of the boards.
Mainly on the strength of sub
forward Ron Bane's marksmanship,
the Bruins tied up the score at 64-all
and 66-all. Then Tucker came
through again. I lis jump shot fol
lowed a tricky in bounds play. The
Cards grabbed the lead and were
never headed.
At 73 to 68, the Indians started tak
ing the ball out on all UCLA fouls.
During this string of fouls, the Cards
worked a play that had been tried
over and over again in practice. It
worked to perfection, with Olie Su/-
daleff looping the ball to Ronnie
Tomsic who was streaking for the
basket.. Ron dumped it. in on a
great driving lay-up. Score: 75 to 63.
With time running out the Cards
played a cool freeze which pro
duced a parade of Bruin fouls. The

It was a brilliant effort for Jim

The Rammer got away from Moore

ol hooks and stuffs. Ed Tucker
wasn't far ofT with a neat 17 digits.
Stanford's toy guards, Ron Tomsic
and Olie Sudzaleff, put in 14 and 13.
The Indian shooting eye was fairly
Eharp, hitting 4(> per cent from the
floor. They also netted 15 out of 25
free throws. This is far below their
normal total. The Bruins made good
cn 34 per cent of their shots.
UCLA was able to stay close
throughout (he game, mainly <in
their superior board control. John
Moore cleared the boards thirteen
times. All told the Bruins gathered
in II rebounds to 2!) for the Cards.
The night before it was a different
story. The South landers connected
with everything but the pleasure of
the Farm rooters. The Bruins reeled
off 13 quick points in a row to leap
in front 1(5 to 5. That was the ball
game right there, although the In

Then were in command of the back

It was during this stall that Coach
Bob Burnett decided to let Ron
Tomsic take a loul shot. There was
something behind the snap decision,
too. The Bruins had orders to foul
and not allow the Cards a shot. By
taking the free throw, the Cards
could get a point up on the score
board and then try for a stolen ball
and a game-winning bucket.

game.

ford's game basketball squad
bounced back Saturday night
for a nifty 77 to 68 victory over
the UCLA Bruins. But the In
dians needed a double win, and
had lost Friday night's game,
72 to 68.
The split with the Bruins added to
the Cal-Southern Cal split, left the
conference standings unchanged. Un
changed except for the fact that two
more games have slipped by and only
four remain on the schedule. That
doesn't yive Boh Burnett and his
crew much leeway in collaring the
pace-setting Bears who are two
games up on the Cards.
The win Saturday night was a real
treat for the Pavilion crowd. The
| score was deadlocked 23-all at. the
j end of a quarter, and tied 42-all at
intermission time. During these fur
ious twenty minutes, neither team
managed to open up more than a
five-point gap. It was that close.
Eddie 'I ucker opened up the sec
j ond half with an amazing flurry.
! He missed his first shot from the
j floor but connected with the next,
j four, including three of his favorite
one-handed jump shots and a Bruin
breaking tip. Jim I'amstead added a
fantastic hook from way under the
backboard and Sudzaleff a free throw
to give the Cards a lead they never
I relinquished.
The third period ended with a (51
i to 57 count. George Zaninovich had
j replaced Tucker who was benching
it with four fouls. George was doing

very well on the boards and the
Cards seemed to have the Westwood
boys rattled. The four-point margin
still wasn't too big as the Bruins
were in command of the boards.
Mainly on the strength of sub
forward Ron Bane's marksmanship,
the Bruins tied up the score at 64-all
and 66-all. Then Tucker came
through again. I lis jump shot fol
lowed a tricky in bounds play. The
Cards grabbed the lead and were

As the old saying goes, it just!
j "wasn't in the Cards." Stan- j
ford's game basketball squad
bounced back Saturday night
for a nifty 77 to 68 victory over
the UCLA Bruins. But the In
dians needed a double win, and
had lost Friday night's game,
72 to 68.
The split with the Bruins added to
the Cal-Southern Cal split, left the
conference standings unchanged. Un
changed except for the fact that two
more games have slipped by and only
four remain on the schedule. That
doesn't yive Boh Burnett and his
crew much leeway in collaring the
pace-setting Bears who are two
games up on the Cards.
The win Saturday night was a real
treat for the Pavilion crowd. The
| score was deadlocked 23-all at. the
j end of a quarter, and tied 42-all at
intermission time. During these fur
ious twenty minutes, neither team
managed to open up more than a
five-point gap. It was that close.
Eddie 'I ucker opened up the sec
j ond half with an amazing flurry.
! He missed his first shot from the
j floor but connected with the next,
j four, including three of his favorite
one-handed jump shots and a Bruin
breaking tip. Jim I'amstead added a
fantastic hook from way under the
backboard and Sudzaleff a free throw
to give the Cards a lead they never
I relinquished.
The third period ended with a (51
i to 57 count. George Zaninovich had
j replaced Tucker who was benching
it with four fouls. George was doing

very well on the boards and the
Cards seemed to have the Westwood
boys rattled. The four-point margin
still wasn't too big as the Bruins
were in command of the boards.
Mainly on the strength of sub
forward Ron Bane's marksmanship,
the Bruins tied up the score at 64-all
and 66-all. Then Tucker came
through again. I lis jump shot fol
lowed a tricky in bounds play. The
Cards grabbed the lead and were
never headed.
At 73 to 68, the Indians started tak
ing the ball out on all UCLA fouls.
During this string of fouls, the Cards
worked a play that had been tried
over and over again in practice. It
worked to perfection, with Olie Su/-
daleff looping the ball to Ronnie
Tomsic who was streaking for the
basket.. Ron dumped it. in on a
great driving lay-up. Score: 75 to 63.
With time running out the Cards
played a cool freeze which pro
duced a parade of Bruin fouls. The
