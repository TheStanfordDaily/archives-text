# Cards Lose, Then Win To Stay in PCC Cellar
## 
### DICK KLEIN Daily Sports Editor 
As the old saying goes, it just!
j "wasn't in the Cards." Stan- j
ford's game basketball squad
bounced back Saturday night
for a nifty 77 to 68 victory over
the UCLA Bruins. But the In
dians needed a double win, and
had lost Friday night's game,
72 to 68.
The split with the Bruins added to
the Cal-Southern Cal split, left the
conference standings unchanged. Un
changed except for the fact that two
more games have slipped by and only
four remain on the schedule. That
doesn't yive Boh Burnett and his
crew much leeway in collaring the
pace-setting Bears who are two
games up on the Cards.
The win Saturday night was a real
treat for the Pavilion crowd. The
| score was deadlocked 23-all at. the
j end of a quarter, and tied 42-all at
intermission time. During these fur
ious twenty minutes, neither team
managed to open up more than a
five-point gap. It was that close.
Eddie 'I ucker opened up the sec
j ond half with an amazing flurry.
! He missed his first shot from the
j floor but connected with the next,
j four, including three of his favorite
one-handed jump shots and a Bruin
breaking tip. Jim I'amstead added a
fantastic hook from way under the
backboard and Sudzaleff a free throw
to give the Cards a lead they never
I relinquished.
The third period ended with a (51
i to 57 count. George Zaninovich had
j replaced Tucker who was benching
it with four fouls. George was doing

very well on the boards and the
Cards seemed to have the Westwood
boys rattled. The four-point margin
still wasn't too big as the Bruins
were in command of the boards.
Mainly on the strength of sub
forward Ron Bane's marksmanship,
the Bruins tied up the score at 64-all
and 66-all. Then Tucker came
through again. I lis jump shot fol
lowed a tricky in bounds play. The
Cards grabbed the lead and were
never headed.
At 73 to 68, the Indians started tak
ing the ball out on all UCLA fouls.
During this string of fouls, the Cards
worked a play that had been tried
over and over again in practice. It
worked to perfection, with Olie Su/-
daleff looping the ball to Ronnie
Tomsic who was streaking for the
basket.. Ron dumped it. in on a
great driving lay-up. Score: 75 to 63.
With time running out the Cards
played a cool freeze which pro
duced a parade of Bruin fouls. The
