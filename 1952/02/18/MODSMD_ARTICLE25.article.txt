# Affiliation—Time for Decision
## 
### 
After last week's Excom decision on the
Young Republican question, a number of stu
dents cried out in alarm and criticized Excom's
action. Yet we wonder how many of these stu
dents expressed their views to their Excom rep
resentative before, and not after, the Executive
Committee meeting last Wednesday night.
We believe that few of those who protested
the decision took it upon themselves first, to
learn the facts of the matter, and second, to ex
press their feelings to their representative,
even though it was known beforehand that the
question would be on the Excorn agenda.
Excom's actions on major student issues in
variably bring about controversy. We criticize,
however, the fact that too many students wait
to express themselves on controversial issues
until AFTER Excom lias made its decision.
Another "controversial" question now lies
before Excom—altiliation with the Free Uni
versity of Berlin. This question deserves
student reflection; and while Excorn must
make the final decision, students should not
thrust the entire responsibility for making
that decision on the minds of the members
of the Executive Committee alone. Rather
students should assist their representative in
this decision by expressing their opinions be
fore the next meeting.
The question of affiliation is one which has
been cloudy and nebulous, not only to the stu
dent body, but also to Excom. A bit of clarifica
tion of the pros and cons of such an action
should be made.
What v/ould affiliation mean? The exact de
tails—to be expressed in a letter of affiliation—
are not yet known; but as we understand it,
affiliation would mean a sort of "active asso
ciation and fellowship" which would involve
an extensive cultural inter-exchange with the
Free University, but no financial obligation
whatsoever.
A great deal of exchange with Berlin is now
carried on, including arr exchange of students;
and as we understand the proposal, affiliation
simply means a formalization of our intent to
continue and furthermore to expand our cul
tural and educational exchange with the Free
University.
Proponents of affiliation point out that this

would be nothing new. It would solidify an al
ready existing friendship with the Free Univer
sity. The idea of affiliation itself originated with
a Free University student, Liselotte Derger of
the office of All German student affairs, who
visited Stanfoid last quarter.
ll would not he setting a precedent, either,
lor as of an txcom action last year, we are
now affiliated with the University ol Delhi,
India. Over the United States, more than
twenty colleges and universities, from Yale
to the University ol California, are affiliated in
some way with foreign universities.
Opposition to affiliation has stemmed from
three problems. (1) Excom has not yet received
complete information as to the extent and de
tail of affiliation. (2) The confusion over the pos
sibility that any Excom action favoring the pro
posal would necessarily obligate future Excoms
which might not have as great an interest in in
ternational relations. (3) If we are to affiliate
with Berlin, then with a snowballing effect, we
might before long be overwhelmed with affilia
tions, thereby concentrating all our efforts on
only a certain few universities over the world.
In our opinion, the advantages and benefits
of the proposed affiliation outweigh the disad
vantages. However, we feel strongly that this
question should not be decided without more
intelligent student discussion.
We know that one Excom representative look
the question back to his class excom, and on
the basis of the incomplete information and a
biased presentation of what information there
was, the class excom took an action. This can
hardly be considered an "intelligent" student
action.
Excom will probably make its decision on the
question of affiliation at its next meeting. At
that time, the Excom members, many of whom
are now undecided, must make their decision—
and that means that interested students should
not wait until after Excom meets to express
their opinions.
Here is the issue. Think it over. Tell your
Excom representative what you think. If you
are really interested—for or against affilia
tion—be present when Excom meets, 7:30,
Vyednesday, in the Excom room of the Stu
dent Union. The time for decision is not after
Excom meets. It is now.— Walt Menninger.
