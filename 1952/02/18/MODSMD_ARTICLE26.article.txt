### PETE GROTHE 
FOR A BKTTER STANFORD: CHAPTER 1
Time now to launch a crusade. Time now to put
into print several thoughts that have been gnawing
at my brain for many months. Time now, then, to
submit for your consideration five areas in which I
think that Stanford's educational program can be
improved.
Briefly, the five points which I plan to dincurs in a
series of four Bull Sessions are:
1. Emphasis on teaching rather than research.
2. Change in Ihe advising system.
3. Expanded Counseling and Guidance Center
facilities.
4. Faculty rating sheets.
5. Abolition of language requirements.
I'd Jike to preface any arguments that I will offer
by saying tv/o things: One is that any decisions I have
reached have not been the result of snap judgments.

I have talked with about 50 stu
dents on this subject and have
spend the past three weeks inter
viewing many of the top men in
the University. I was fortunate
enough to get a 45-minute inter
view with Dr. Sterling, an hour
and a half talk with Dean Win
bigler, interviews with Dean
Whitaker of Humanities and Sci
ences, Dean Hilgard of Graduate
Studies, Dean Strothmann of of

languages, and eight other (op persons in various fields
of education. A total of Ifi hours was spent on these
interviews.
Secondly, the points that I am going to discuss are
not startingly new. Vic Palmieri touched on several of
these last year. Dick McLean devoted three columns
to the language requirements, and all five are right
under faculty and administrative consideration.
This last point is very important. 'Ihe fad that
the administration and faculty are weighing the
various arguments means that student opinion will
play an immensely important part. I received two
general impressions from interviewing these top
men in the University. One was that they were en
dowed with an uncommon amount of wisdom and
good sense, and the second was that they felt it
their duty to listen to student opinion.
And so, if you read this Bull Session and the next
three that follow and agree with the arguments and
then forget all about it, a lot of printers' ink and
your time and mine have been wasted. On the other
hand, if you talk it up with both students and faculty
this will have a very real effect in making Stanford
an even better institution of learning.
And so on to the first point- -emphasis on teaching
rather than research. Here is what I think:
You and I both know the type of professor who has
written volumes of books and numerous articles a
real expert in his field. But when it comes to lecturing

lie strikes out with the bases loaded. Students have
to take ten cups of Cellar coffee to stay awake in his
class, but he doesn't particularly care, because he
has a national reputation, and he thinks he can stand
there and overpower the undergrads with his name.
Which, incidentally, isn't true.
Fortunately, the above case is the exception rather
than the rule. There is a high correlation between
good teaching and good research. The point is, how
ever, that there are enough exceptions to make the
problem a very real one.
It's a natural tendency for instructors to stress re
search rather than teaching. There are more tangible
rewards given for research and article and book writ
ing than for good, sound teaching. It is generally true
that when promotions and salary increases are meted
out, research and writing have more weight than
teaching ability. A professor makes a national or
state-wide name on the basis of research and writing.
My proposal, then, would be to place more tangible
rewards (promotion and salary increases) lor good
teaching. The University of Chicago has such a
system and it is highly successful in giving the in
structors and professors an incentive to spend more
time on teaching.
I realize that research and teaching supplement fur
at least should supplement) each other. Research has
a very important part in University life, but teaching
should be given more emphasis, even if it has to be
at the expense of research.
The old war-cry of the education department is
"teach students rather than subjects." In other words,
a professor should teach Tom and Mary, human be
ingsâ€”not a colli, lifeless subject. Were the plan of
giving more tangible rewards for teaching put into
effect, the war-cry would probably become more of
a reality.
In line with the emphasis on teaching rather than
research plan, more importance should be placed, I
think, on teaching ability when a new instructor is
selected. Some of the departments should have more
discretion in choosing the instructors that they inflict
on lower division students. For the truth of the
matter is that junior colleges have better instruction
in many departments than we have in the first two
years. I would cite English as one example.
In many departments, however, top men in the de
partment teach the beginning courses. This is some
thing that should be striven for throughout the Uni
versity.
In summary, I believe more emphasis should be
placed on teaching by (I) giving tangible rewards
for good institution; (2) Hiving greater weight to
teaching ability in the selection of new faculty mem
bers; and (II) having top men in the various de
partments lake turns teaching the introductory
courses.
