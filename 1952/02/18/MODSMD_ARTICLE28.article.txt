# New Guinness Hit Comes to Guild
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
With "The Lavender Hill
Mob," now at the Guild, Ealing
scores again. In recent years,
the little London studio has
come to be almost synonymous
with sparkling originality and
pointed humor, rare qualities
which have characterized such
of its past triumphs as "Passport
to PimJico," "Tight Little Island,"
and "Kind Hearts and Coro
nets." "Lavender Hill" follows
in this fine tradition of fresh, in
telligent, witty picture fare.
The movie falls into two sections,
one of high comedy and one of
larce. 'J he first half shows in de-

tail how a prim,
meticulous clerk
(played by the
protean Alec
Guinness) steals
a million pounds
in gold from the
Hank of England
and smuggles it
to the Continent.

The second half is a wild, slapstick
manhunt in which Guinness and his
cohort (Stanley Holloway) become
the objects of a nationwide search.
Calmly, Guinness incubates his

plot, then, with cuperb ingenuity,
reevals it to Holloway, a manufac
turer of Eiffel Tower souvenirs who
has the soul of an arist. Their joint
plan is enticingly simple: get the
stolen gold out of England by melt
ing it into towers and pick up the
shipment in Paris. Meanwhile,
Guinness has already recru : ted two
safecrackers to handle the less deli
cate aspects of the job.
The whole hilarious fantasy
succeeds to perfection — and all
would have been line if a party of
touring British schoolgirls hadn't
bought the wrong towers — the
gold to .vers — and carried them
right back to England. Guinness
and Holloway chase them back
across the Channel, only to find
themselves l.eing chased.
The film is a natural for Guin
ness. lie manages, as usual, the
subtleties and shadings of character
which would baffle most actors. His
bank clerk is a masterful combina
tion of inward mischief and out
ward decorum. Once again changing
his face, his walk, his voice, he lit
erally becomes the person he por
trays. But this will not Ie news to
those who have recently seen him
as Fagin, as Disraeli, or as the vic
im of six murders in one picture.
Delighted moviegoers have come to
expect the incredible from Alec
Guinness, and he will not let them
down in "The Lavender Hill Mob."
