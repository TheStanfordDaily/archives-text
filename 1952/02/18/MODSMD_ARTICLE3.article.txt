### 
LONDON, Monday, Feb. 18â€”The
British government announced to
day that it intended to test its first
atomic weapon in Australia some
time this year.
Prime Minister Winston Churchill
signaled Britain's giant stride in the
atomic field after a late start. A
carefully worded statement from
No. 10 Downing Street referred only
to "an atomic weapon," but said
nothing of its characteristics.
