# Advisory Board Target Of Daily Cal Editorial
## 
### 
The Daily Californian in its
first edition of the new semester,
last Tuesday, made editorial
comment on the newly created
Advisory Board under which it
must formulate its futuie publi
cation policies.
On the front page of Cal's daily
newspaper was a cartoon depicting
a black devil (labeled "censOr") and
a white angel (labeled "advisor"),
both looming before a student jour
nalist. The cartoon was captioned
"Which Will It Be?" In the Lack
ground the dark clouds were pic
tured hanging over the Campanile.
In an editorial entitled "Quo
Vadiinus?" (lie Cal editorial start'
members tailed the situation
"foreboding, particularly when
viewed in the context of our na
tion's growing surrender to irra
toinal fear."
"Throughout the country," it
said, "overemphasized fear has
made it . . . too easy to remove
annoyances, too easy to secure the
dubious blessing of conformity."
The 13-member Advisory Board
was selected by President Robert
Gordon Sproul. Represented on the
board, which Sproul claims is strict
ly "advisory" rather than "dicta
torial," are the Daily Californian,
the faculty, the alumni, and t' ir> ad
ministration. Most of the board
members are persons with journal
istic backgrounds.
In a statement to the board at its
first meeting last Saturday, Sproul
stated that the board "is not to be in
any sense an agency for the censor
ship of the Daily Californian."
He said, "I am confident that it
will prove to bo helpful in many
ways to the University and espe
cially to the newspaper itself."
While the apparent cause for
the new advisorship to the paper
is its publication of two pro-
Conununist articles last Decem
ber, the Daily Cal editorial point
ed out that, unfortunately, this
was not the true cause.
It claimed that the roots went
deeper—into an old, strained en
mity with the ASL'C Excom,
which made one of the initial rec

ommendations for the setting up
of an advisory board.
In a closing gesture of acquies
cence the editorial stuff wrote: "Wt

visory Board and benefit from the
