Students who en'oy browsing the
shelves of old book stores or who
are interested book collectors are
encouraged to visit the surplus book
loom in the Main Library. The
book room 1 , open all day, is lo
cated on the main floor in the re
ceiving room.
A long list of titles are on sale.
Covering almost every subject, the i
books range from the complete
works of Thackeray and the Ms- !
moirs of Napoleon to problems in
insurance and economics.
The books are sold at nominal j
prices. They are volumes that are J

perfluous copies of books already on
the Library shelves.
