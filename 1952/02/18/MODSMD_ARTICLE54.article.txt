# RESERVED BOOK ROOM
## Where Students Study or Sleep 
### SUE WHEAT 
Through the windows on my
right I con see the groon oaks
bowing gently to the wind
against the blue winter sky. But
turning back to the book in front
of rne I am aware only of the
buzz of the fluorescent lights
interrupted by the occasional
dtone of a plane overhead or the
thump of a head as sleep claims
another victim.
The setting?
The Reserved Book Room, of
course.
This large, well-lighted room on
the ground floor of Stanford's main
Hbe will seat 120 students in desks
and 50 more in chairs.
Large Student Turnover
This room is to studying what
Rossotti's is to playing. And if you
think this is an exaggeration, look
at the facts:
For the week of Jan. 21-27, the
Reserved Book Room counted a
turnover of S,f)ol students. That's

|an average of 843 a day or G0.2 ev
i cry hour! (The maximum number
j of students reported during any one
J hour was 133.)
Over 4,408 two-hour hooks were
j checked out for this same week,
j along with 420 long-period books.
Fating Hours Stark
The busie. t hours of the Reserved
Book Room arc 10:30 a.m. and 8:30
p.m. Dinner and lunch hours are
comparatively slack, although rec
ords show that students would rath
er miss lunch than dinner. On Feb.
4, 33 students were counted at 12:30
and only four at 6:30.
Sometimes a Monday morning
| customer count will give a good
indication of the previous weekend
activities. For example, on Monday
morning, Jan. 28, only 11 students
were in the Book Room at 8:30. On
Monday, Feb. 4, however, after the
first big f-ki - weekend, 31 con
science-stricken .souls were counted
at 8:30.
Circulation Problem
Fred J. Priddle, chicf circulation
librarian, reports that the main
; problem he and his staff face is
i simply getting the right books down
j on reserve and keeping them there.

Between quarters this involves a
huge shift of thousands of books
which must be transferred from the
stacks and inventoried .
Edwin G. Leiser is the librarian
in charge of the Reserved Book
Room and Douglas Atcheson is Â«
full-time worker. Working under
them are 18 part - time student
workers.
Leiser says that although there is
"occasionally a customer who does
n't like to be regimented," most
students are very patient and co
operative. (Of course there is al
ways the student who (ills out a call
card in hieroglyphics.)
Few Books Lost
Not many books are lost, Leber
reports, although many are re
turned late. Fines for last week
amounted to $23.90. Proceeds from
fines, incidentally, ro to the general
University fund from which the
Trustees appropriate money for
more books.
Most good cloth - bound books
have been found to last about five
or six years, even under constant
use. Paper - bound editions, how
ever, are rarely good for more than
a year. The depreciation rate de
pends both on the book and on the
course. "The new paper-bound- edi
tions of Christcnsen and Kirpatrick
(Poly Sci 1 and 2) are beginning to
come apart already," Leiser said.
'"AH in all, we just try our best,"
said Priddle.
