# Urge Rearmament
## 
### 
LISBON, Portugalâ€” Allied mili
tary men warned today that con
tinued delay in rearming free Ger
many may make it impossible to
prevent Russian occupation of all
or pai l of Europe and a costly, de
structive "war of liberation."
The warning was directed specifi
cally to France, which early today
capped a consistent record of oppo
sition to effective German rearma
ment by attaching new anti-Ger
man strings to its acceptance of the
European army plan.
