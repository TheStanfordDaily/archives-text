# AWS Prexies Speak At Leadership Meet
## 
### 
A thorough explanation of AWS—its history, organization, pur
pose, and goals—highlighted the AWS Leadership Conference in
the Women's Clubhouse Saturday. Margaret Gairdner, AWS pres
ident, addressed over 150 officers, living group directors, and
RA's. She pointed out that AWS is becoming more of a govern
mental organization. ♦

AWS has been under its present
name since 1948. Prior to that time
it was known as Women's Confer
ence and was concerned primarily
with social organization. In 1944
when sororities were abolished
Women's Conference handled just
housing and social regulations. Then
in 1948 standing committees were
strengthened, the name was
changed, and AWS was made a co
ordinating body for all women stu
dents.
Women's Council, now an ex
officio judicial body, was a sepa
rate organization until 1948. Two
new changes have been initiated
this year: the hoard meets only
once a month and elections are
held winter quarter.
Miss Gairdner pointed out that
since there are now 1,700 under
graduate women, representing a
large increase, there is more need
for a governmental co-ordinating
body.
Sally St. John, AWS president
elect, outlined a few possible
points of her new program: mak
ing the scholarship committee a

standing committee, holding a
mass meeting of all women; hav
ing a publicity representative; and
continuing to bring off - campus
and graduate women into the
group as a whole.
Individual meetings of all the of
ficers—presidents, social chairmen,
secretaries, treasurers, and council
representatives—were held in the
morning.
Miss Elizabeth Crandall, Direc
tor of Lrrrunita, said, "I believe
this was one of the best one-day
conferences I have seen. Tin;
group was extremely interested
and an amazing amount of mate
rial was clearly presented and
covered. It might lie interesting
to Stanford women to realize the
great amount of efficient work
their officers do."
Ventura President Harriet Whit
ten pointed out that "The most ben
eficial part of the conference was
the over-all picture it gave me of
AWS, what it means, and how it
functions. The conference was ex
tremely valuable to all the officers
in our house."
