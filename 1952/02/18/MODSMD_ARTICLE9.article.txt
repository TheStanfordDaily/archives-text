# Library Shows Tibetan Relics
## 
### 
Buddhist prayer wheels, monks'
robes, sacramental instruments, in
addition to many examples of Ti
betan folklore, arts, and crafts, col
lected by Professor Frederic Spie
gelberg of Asiatic and Slavic Stud
ies, will be on display in the glass
cases on the upper floor of the Main
Library this week.
Professor Spiegelberg accumu
lated a full crate of Tibetan articles
during his trip of 1949. He pene
trated the Sikkim area of the Hi
malaya range and visited many Ti
betan lamaseries. Among his collec
tion are Tibetan blankets, stamps,
books, clothing, ancient and con
temporary paintings, women's jew
elry of brass and beads, and a val
uable manuscript with an unusual
history.
This manuscript he found when
at the foot of the main mountain
pars leading to Lhasa. It was cold,
so Spiegelberg bought a blanket
from a native merchant he chanced
upon. As he purchased it, an an
cient manuscript, blackened by the
years, fell out. He has been trans
lating it during the two years since
the trip, and the manuscript with
its translation will be displayed.
The exhibit will be augmented by
portions of the complete Buddhist
canon (similar in purpose to the
Bibie) po-ssessed by the Stanford
Library. This priceless collection,
one of the few complete ones ex
tant, was givpn to Stanford Univer
sity two years ago by Lama Tokwan
Tada of Tibet.
Tibetan paper, samples of which
will also be exhibited, is free from
the threat of termites. This paper is
made of a poisonous plant which
kills when eaten. The use of this
paper is responsible for the exist
ence of well-preserved volumes.
