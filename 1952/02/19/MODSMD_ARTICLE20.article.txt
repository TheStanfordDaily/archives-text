# AEC Announces New Atomic Test
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb 18 (UP)—The qoveiiiirient announced Id
day that a new series oi experimental atomic explosions will be
set oil on isolated Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific and there was
immediate speculation that a hydrogen bomb might bo detonated.
A carefully v/orded announcement by the Defense Department

and the Atomic Energy Commission
said preparations for the tests already
are under Chairman Gordon
Dean of the Atomic Commission
said previously they would be held
in the spring.
Choice of Eniwetok as the rite of
the test'; —rather than the French
men's Flat proving grounds in Ne
vada — led to the belief that the
United States may now be ready to
try to explode the awesome H
bomb. The Atomic Commission uses
Eniwetok for its "big" explosions.
Dean announced after the last
tests at Eniwetok in the spring of
1951 that they "contributed toward
development" of the hydrogen
bomb. Scientists learned then that
they could produce the multi-mil
ljon-dcgree heat needed to trigger
the so-called super bomb.
Logically, the next step would be
to try and explode tritium, the
triple-weight hydrogen which is the
primary H-bomb explosive.
Sen. Brien Mc'Mahon (D., Conn.),
chairman of the Joint Congressional
Atomic Energy Committee, said that
"when you think you have made an
improvement, you have to test it to
make sure."
