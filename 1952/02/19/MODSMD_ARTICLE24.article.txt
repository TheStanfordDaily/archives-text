A major policy split is cracking
through the ranks of the Republican
party as Presidential aspirants ar
gue opposite stands on the festering
but vital question of Asia.
Cries of "war faction" are heard
as party tanks line up behind out
spoken Senator Robert Taft or dark
horse candidate Governor Earl
Warren of California. With Gen
eral Eisenhower conducting a silent
campaign based rolely on personal
attractiveness, it has fallen to War
ren and Taft to define party issues.
In policy definition so far, Talt
and Warren have stood at sword's
point. Disagreeing on domestic pol •
icy, Warren is urging the adoption
of "welfare legislation" while Taft
demands there he "no further ex
tension of governmental powers."
However, il is in* the realm of
international relations thai Ihe
two While House bidders most
j strenuously disagreed. While Taft
I urges the immediate arming of
J Formosa-camped Nationalist Chi -
j nesc, Warren asks Ihe U.S. "to
slay out of China."
Though promising that the party
will stand firmly behind whoever is
named standard bearer, Taft and
Warren both claim that they will
press their argument until the issue
is settled at the Chicago convention
in July.
Supporting General Douglas Mac-
Arthur's hard - boiled Far Eastern

policy, Taft insists that America
should immediately equip the Na
tionalist:; and allow them to hurl
inva ion forces against the Commu
nist-held Chinese mainland.
W. ren, on the other hand, de
clared last week thai i* would he
unwise for the United States l<»
have any part in sendim; N»-
lionalisl troops to "reconquer
China."
"If we da thai, it's our war,"
Warren said.
Amplifying his remarks, Warren
advised that 1520.000 Chinese can
hardly reconquer China."
That figure is the current estimate
of the troops available for action on
Formosa.
"It would be up to us to see the

war through if we started it." saii
Wai ren, "but 1 have never been able
to persuade myself that we should
start that kind of war."
Warren's remarks on Chin fol
lowed a speech by Tafi in Seattle
last Monday urging a "full-scale in
vasion of Red Asia."
Tail's support stems from con
servative elements within the party,
including (leneral P4 a c Arthur.
I Jarping mi the inability of the
present administration to stem the
tide of Awian Communism, Taft and
his backer, have taken their plans
to the people in speeches across the
nation,
With such vigf "'oils speakers as
California's Senator William F.
KuiMvimi'l .• lumping Ihe nation to
gain support for a "ge< touch"
policy in Asia, Taft claims some
rank and file backing.
But Warren is not alon° in his
questioning of the proposed ' get
tough" plan.
Senator Wayne Morse 'I', Ore.)
in Senate debate last week claimed
that Taft was loading a "growing
.vai party for ail-out war in Asia."
[VIm I,'/*, in bis attack on Taft'*.
poliries, warned Republicans lliat
' if it is maneuvered at the ('hi
csi£«i convention into a position
thai iir lilies the war faction label
it \" ill go flown to defeat in No
vember, as it should.''
Morse went on to say it is "the
| patriotic duty of any citizen in any
i party lo li above partisan: hip and
! placn Ihe issue of peace above Ihe
; partisan considerations of a Presi
dential campaign."
Though the policy split is not yet
wide and does not involve many
party members, the wedge has been
I driven home and the fissure no
doubt will widen as convention
time nears.
Both Taft and Warren are known
as men who stick hard by their
I guns. Further, an interesting de
' velopment may arise if Eisenhower

i -.booses to unveil His stand. Warren
claim.; that his and the general's
views on foreign affairs match
It appear:; certain that Mir China
plank in (he Fepuhiica'n platform
will become the major issue in se
lecting a party candidate. No doubt,
ton, the issue will have much in
fluence in determining who will
swivel in the President's large
leather chair come Jan. 20, 1053.
