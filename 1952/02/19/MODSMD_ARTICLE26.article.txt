ings late Monday night agreed to
accept a British compromise by
which present controls over Ger

The United States, British, and
French foreign ministers met for al

one week to answer a recommenda
tion by NATO that she contribute
$2,673,000,000 to defense, but Ger

for the upkeep of Allied troops in
Germany.
Ihe accoida on controls, war
