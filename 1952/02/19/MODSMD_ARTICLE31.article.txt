### PETE GROTHE 
FOR A BETTER STANFORD: CHAPTER 2
AN ADRENALIN SHOT FOR OUR
AO VISING SYSTEM
Yesterday I pointed out that teaching could lie im
proved by (1) giving tangible rewards for good teach
ing, (2) giving more weight to teaching ability (rather
than research) in selecting new instructors, arid ('.))
having top men in the departments take turns teach
ing the introductory courses.

Before proceeding to the sub
ject of the lower division advising
system, I would like to express
two thoughts. One is that I like
Stanford. And I say this with all
the emphasis those words can
carry. These suggestions for im
provements are not the ramblings
of a disgruntled undergrad. They
come front a person who would
like to see Stanford become an
even better place at which to
spend four years.

The second is that most letters to the editor co:ne
from people who disagree with something that is
written. Those who agree with what is written find
their thoughts already expressed and so don't bother
to write. However, as 1 mentioned yesterday, every
letter that comes in will have a very real effect on
what actions are taken on these various problems.
The administration and faculty, realizing that by
definition a university revolves around i*s students,
are anxious to listen to campus opinion.
And with that we move to the problem of Stan
ford's lower division advising system. Dr. Kildare, a
shot of adrenalin, please.
Listen to Dr. Sterling: "Our lower division ad
vising system needs much improvement. Advising
needs more time given to ii; it needs more co
ordination; and the services of the adviser need
more recognition by the University."
Mind you, these weren't the words of a student.
They were the words of the President of the Uni
versity. Why then, you may ask, do the students
have to concern themselves with this problem if Dr.
Sterling is aware of the situation? A good question.
Were Dr. Sterling and those in the administration
directly in charge of the advising system to set up an
ideal advising blueprint, there is no insurance that
it would work. Because the solution of this problem
lias to come from three sources - the administration,
the advisers themselves, and we, the students.
It's the lob of the administration to set up a good
system. There have been notable strides forward in
the last year, but not nearly enough. First, the ad
vising system should be more coordinated. The
advisers should have more frequent meetings in
which they are brieted on (he latest developments
that aftect advising and in which they learn Ihe
answers to question'; that advisees ate likely to
bring up.

Second, the administration should require or at
least vigorously encourage every advisci to spend tit.
least two hours a quarter with each advice. In this
time, the adviser would discuss with the advisee the
courses he is taking and any curriculum or adjust
ment problems he may h:ive. The amount ol time
spent, with each advisee would differ according to the
problems of the advisees!
Now, I realize that "requiring" a student to spend
two one-hour sessions with his adviser may produce
a negative attitude on the part of the student. On the
other hand, it' the adviser says something like, W«dl,
John, how about dropping around and seeing me at
3 o'clock Monday. It's nothing compulsory, hut I'd
just like to discuss your courses with you and see
how you're getting along," then the advisee would
come with a receptive attitude.
'third, the teaching load and/or research load of
advisers should be lightened it they are already over
worked.
Fourth, as in teaching, more tangible rewards
should be given for good advising. Advising is gen
erally a thankless job as far as recognition by the
University is concerned. Thus, good advising should
count when promotion and salary increases are con
sidered.
As far as (lie adviser is concerned, he of course,
would play pivotal part in the reawakening of our
advising system. It's always liecn my thought that
teaching is more of a calling than i( is "just another
job." Ami that if a person goes into teaching he
should feel morally responsible !i» spend much of
his time with students. An adviser, then, should he
willing and able to spend as much time its each
advisee requires.
Second, an adviser should take the time to find out
the requirements of the various departments :nd
should be prepared to answer any questions that
come tip. While talking with students, I have heard
comments such as these:
"I know two kids who didn't graduate with their
class, because their lower division advisers didn't
know what some of the requirements are." "Heaven
help you if you plan to be a biology major arid you
get an adviser who's an English instructor." "My
adviser doesn't, help me a bit."
Fortunately, however, most, of our advisors are
very üb'e men, and some cooperation between them
and the administration could make our advising sys
tem a whale of a good one.
We students, of course, have to cooperate also.
In short, an adviser should he just that ... a per
son who advises. He should be more than a rubber
stamp who signs study cards at pre-reg time. As
Vic Falmieri wrote last year, "As it si: n<ls now, mo; I
students pick their major out of a straw hat." A
sound advising system would eliminate that problem.
