## Political Parties—Education Toward Citizenship 
### 
To the Editor:
Political parties v/ere not created by our Constitu
tion, but they appear to be a necessary means of poli
tical expression. While neither perfect not necessarily
ideal they survive because thus far they have best
satisfied our needs.
It we work on the assumption lhat parties have
something to say which is, worth our consideration,
and worthy of our support il we believe in what they
say, there seem to be at least two functions of respon
sible citizenship: 1. Critical analysis of wind parties
say. 2. Full support of what we believe. The sec
ond may not agree with the first but to be effective it
must concern itself with political par tie.*:. If we be
lieve what a party says we work with it to make our
idea:: felt. If we believe what no party says we start
one of our own, or we choose the one most agreeable
and work through it to make our ideas fell.
Excom is consul* ring supplying education in the
aiea ol one function of citizenship; critical analysis
«i( what parties say. What of the other function?
How do we best support our beliefs? IKvcotu wisely
recognizes education as involving how to think,
' analyze and reach conclusions best suited to our
needs, but dots education stop there? Is not an idea
■terile if we don't know what to do with it?
t can't help but feel that political parties are not.
to be shunned They arc to be understood and coped
with. II we divorce ourselves from an understanding
of their mode of operation we nurture sell ignorance
of the means through which we are compelled to work
as citizens. Why should Stanford students leave the
Farm lacking education in a field so vital to intelligent
participation in representative government? Why
settle for less educational experience than what we
expect of responsible citizenship?

Of course there will Vie some who say: "Wo need
first-hand knowledge of political organizations. Wo
need to learn by experience how they operate."
There is a simple answer to these people. We ran
get our political experience hy sitting in those com
fortable Mem And seals and li; ;tening lo tlif- speak
ers that the Public Excrcises Committee will furnish
us.
That way we don't soil our hands. We don't have
to get out and Ido preeiricf work, foi instance. We
don't have to ring doorbells and say: I'm a Young
Republican from Stanford, and I'd like (o 1..11 lo you
about supporting General iVlaeArthur for President."
Now (here are some who will argue lh.it knocking
on a door and asking for support lot General Mac-
Aithur would he a real educational ex| erience es
pecially iC the door v/erc opened hy an ex-GI. Hut
people who talk this way are probably Democrat';
to begin with, so they i> ally don't count.
Again, congratulation.'! to IVxcom for taking a
courageous stand on this issue.
