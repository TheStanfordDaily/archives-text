To the Editor:
. Congratulations to Excom for agreeing unanimous
ly with President Sterling. Excom showed mature
judgment in reversing its position on the Young
(Republican issue.
After all, it is a rather dangerous thing to disagree
with our elders -the Board of Trustees, for instance
I â€”who do die best they can to guide us and give us
the benefit of the wisdom they've accumulated over
the years.
All fair-minded persons will agree with Excom
that political action at Stanford is undesirable. We
nil know how unclean partisan politics are.
It's true that the country has been saddled with
this evil for 170 years, but that's no reason we should
allow il to infiltrate into the Stanford family. Why
fcontaminate oui elves with partisan politic:; before
we have to?
