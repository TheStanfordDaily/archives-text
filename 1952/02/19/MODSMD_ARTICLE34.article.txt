Ti. Shell, art graduate, is to clarify remarks made
by Dr. Karl Birkmeyer oil modern art in a recent
lecture. Dr. Birkmeyer was inadvertently (jiiotrd
by The Daily out of context.)
To the Editor:
Your report (Daily. Feb. M, 1 D.12) on llie recent
lecture by Dr. Birkmeyer on modern art, warrants
comment.
Already the headline is misleading. The word
"shock" was not used in a moral sense, but rather in
a mechanical one. What Dr. Birkineyei meant, speak
ing of Dadaism in particular, was that lli" modern
artist attempts to "jolt" I lit? public, presumably out of
its Victorian complacency.
The most violent misunderstanding may be caused
by your "quote" that one must not take modern art
seriously. The train of thought was, that the public
judges modern art with renaissance criteria. To gain
an understanding of modern art one must try to un
derstand the problems of today and the problems ol
the modern artist. Among other means of trying to
understand, Dr. Birkmeyer said that often the artists
intentions are satyrical, sarcastic, or just plain funny,
and one must see also the aspect of fun and play and
not take this aspect too seriously.
I have rarely heard a lecture on modern art by an
art historian which has tackled the problems ol mod
ern art more seriously, in an endeavour to show that
perhaps we are wrong, not the modern arlist, who
sensitively and with courage merely registers the
existential situation of tod.iv.
