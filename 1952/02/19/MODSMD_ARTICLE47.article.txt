15ASKETHALL'S BIG PROBLEM
We walked into Coach Bob Burnett's office yesterday to find out what he
thought of the experimental free throw rule now being tried in the Northern
Division of the PCC. The rule now used in the Northland gives a second
J ree throw to a player who misses his first attempt on a regular one-shot foul.
Burnett quickly brought up the whole question ot the cheapness ol the
personal foul, which he thinks is the biggest problem conlronting the hard
wood game today.
lie made il clear that something must be done about excessive and wanton
fouling—especially in late stages of the game when one team gets slightly
ahead as UCLA did Friday night. Then the Bruins could foul the Cards all
over the place, and they'd never get a floor shot off. On the other hand,
Stanford would be equally over-aggressive trying to steal the ball from a
UCLA stall.
I'urnett thought that the Northern innovation is definitely a step in
the right direction, making the foul more expensive. Maybe this new rule
is the proper one that should he instituted nationally next year.
Despite his relative youth, he does not believe something radical is
necessary to correct the situation—like the proposal some scholarly individ
ual made to VViil Connolly's column Sunday which would subtract two
points from a team every time a player committed a foul.
Bob Ferrick, San Jose State mentor who dropped into the office, agreed
wholeheartedly with Burnett on the problem of the personal. He offered a
rule the pros use to equalize the situation. In the last several minutes of the
game, the ball is put into play after a successful free shot by a jump between
the fouler and the foulee.
Both coaches agreed that some practicable solution is almost certain to
be adopted when the Basketball Rules Committee meets in Seattle March 23
to 2<i to di.scu.ss the rules for next fall.
NEW I OOTBAI.L RULES
The 1*152 football rule changes are out and a couple are worth comment,
even out of season. In general, the College Football Rules Coin went on
(he principle that so many changes have been made in the past few years
that '.">2 should he set aside to let them sink in.
The principle revisions they did make included a reversion to the 1948
clipping rule: any block made from behind a man will again be cause for a
15 yard assessment instead of just those below the waist as it was last fall.
Also, greater protection was given the passer. He was defined as a ball
carrier EVEN AFTER HE'S THROWN THE BALL. Now he'll be able to
straight-arm and otherwise ward off would-be crushers even after he's let fly.
Any player faking a fair catch signal will hereafter be given a 15 yard
penalty, and a fourth change provides both a minus five yards and a charged
time-out for substitutions made while the clock is running, instead of just
the penalty as before.
MORE ON THE GRIDIRON — COP is cutting it close trying to buy into
"big time" football. Even with the record USF game, the Tigers just about
broke even in '51 football, not making enough to finance the rest of their
athletic program. As a result they are dropping baseball for lack of a $1,100
minimum budget. In addition it is unlikely they will show with a swim
team for lack of varsity material. Apparently the mermen are seeking schools
with more well-rounded athletic programs.
