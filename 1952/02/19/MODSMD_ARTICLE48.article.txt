# Tennis Squad To Face SJS
## 
### PHIL HERMAN 
Coach Bob Renker's charges will
journey to San Jose today to play
San Jose State College. Leading the
Spartans will be Butch Kerkorian,
a hard-hitting southpaw with three
years' varsity experience. Satur
day's return tennis meet with the
Palo Alto Tennis Club was canceled
due to rain.
Stanford will be represented by a
well-balanced squad. Starting the
line-up are Tom Lewyn and Char
lie Hickox who, with solid ground
strokes, operate mainly from the
base line. At third and fourth
spot.s are George Gentry and Bob
Sibert, who follow their big serves
into the net to gain their wins.
Following them are Art Fish and
Jim Cornish, two fast - improving
sophomores who may later in the
j season move up the ladder. Backing
J up the team are two contending al
ternates: George Stewart and Dean
Brinkman.
The doubles pairings, as an
nounced by Coach Renker, are
Lewyn and Gentry, Ilickox and Si
bert, and Fish and Cornish.
The match with San Jose should
give the team their second win in
as many starts. Next Saturday the
boys will take a holiday rest. On
March 1 the Cards will host the
powerful California Tennis Club,
an aggregation of some of the top
players in the country.
