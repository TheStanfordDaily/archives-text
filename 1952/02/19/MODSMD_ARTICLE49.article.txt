# Baseball Team to Play Opener With Fort Ord
## 
### 
With their initial contest rained
out, the varsity baseball team faces
Fort Ord tomorrow, in what will be
their f.rst game cf the season,
weather permitting. Game time i.-
3:15 on the Sunken Diamond.
Coach Everett Dean announce:
that the same lineup that was
scheduled to start for Saturday's
game againsf the Palo A'to Oak?
will see action tomorrow. Starting
on the mound will be Rog Osen
baugh.
Dean yesterday said that the con
tent withs the Oaks was postponed,
not canceled. The game will be
played later in the season as soon
as a date can be arranged that is
suitable to both clubs.
The same hurling plan will be
followed as was scheduled Satur-

day. Osenbaugh will hurl for three
innings, followed by Bob Murphy,
who will pitch the middle three
frames. Phil Page is to finish the
game.
Little is known about the Fort
Ord club, except for the generally
high rating given military teams.
Such squads as Fort Ord often have

former professional players on thcr
rosters, so Dean has no worry about
lack of competition in tomorrow'.'-
game.
The lineup for the Indians will
include Dick Corzine and Jack
Shepard at the catching position.
Rav Swartz and Hal Hennesy at

first base, and Art Abrahamson at
second base. On the third-base sf.ck
will be Rich Scramaglia and Owen
Powell, and Warren Goodrich will
complete the infield at shortstop.
Cnuck Essegian, Dave Po:.en
krantz, and Dick Cole will play in
the outfield to finish the lineup.
Hitting in the clean-up position will
be catchers Corzine and Shepard.
The team was not able to practice
yesterday due to weather. It has
been four days now since the squad
has had a good workout, and so
Dean hopes for clear, warm weather
this afternoon.
Another game with a military
team is scheduled for Saturday,
when the Indians face MofTett Field.
Next week the varsity plays three
games against San Francisco State,
USF, and San Jose State.
