# PETE GROTHE
## Punts and Pitches 
### 
Like the shrimp bn.it, our bnr-ket
ball team is a'comin'.
And as a matter of fact, as of last
Saturday night, it had come. Everett
Derm, who for 30 years w:ss con
sidered one of the top cavr mentors
in the country, said to trainer Connie
Jarvis in the dressing room after the
game, "Listen, UCLA was mighty
lucky to go home with a split. "That !
was Stanford's best game c i t!ie ,
year."
Then he went up to a panting Jim j
Ramstead and said, "Jimmy, that was I
the best game of your career.'
For the record, Stanford was edged
72 to 08 on Friday night and gained
i a 77. to 08 revenge en Saturday,
I mainly on Ramstead's 25 points. It
was the slender captain's 22nd birth
| day, and although he had twisted his
ankle the before and had hurt
his knee in practice, he celebrated it
by turning in one of the most spec
tacular games we have ever seen.
Olie Has Arrived
His 25 points, scored on 10 field
' goals and 5 charities, only tell halt
| of the story. The other half is the
! 13 rebounds he gobbled in.
The eager who really "arrived'
j last Saturday was Olio SuzdalefT, the
I little scooter from San Francisco,
j Not only did Olie drop in 13 points,
t put on a masterful exhibition of
dribbling, sell cokes and sweep the
floor at intermission, but he also held
the very deadly Don Johnson to one
j (1) point on Saturday.
Ron Tomsic, the sweetest freshman
find in the league, has been arriving
j all the time. The jut-jawed frosh
has the ability to combine power
with grace. There is very little doubt
that he will be one of the outstand-
I hoopsters in Farm annals.
We don't have to say anything
about Eddie Tucker. To mention the
name Tucker is to give the synonym
for poetry in action. All he did was
mesh 40 points over the weekend.
Do Cards Have Chance?
Add the name Jim Walsh, who was
I selected player of the week last

week, and you have somewhat of a
good team. So good that it has scored |
76 more points than California, who ;
at last report is leading the rest of j
the pack. The point I forgot to men
tion is that opponents have chalked
up 547 digits against the Indians, j
more than against any other team I
in the league.
And so we come to the question, j
i "Does Stanford have a chance to win 1
; the race for the honors." And the
] answer is, "yes." If we win the next 1
1 four, the worst we can have is a tie
i for first place. We can win three out
of the next four, and still take the
j gonfalon.
Raffs to Riches Tale
Someone from the gallery is asking
what possesses us with the madness
to believe that the Cards can be
successful in the next four tiffs. We
think they will be, because in topping
UCLA they beat a team that is better
than both USC and Cal. Also, in
■ recent years, Stanford has had an
unblemished record of unsuccess
j against the Bruins. This year they
j split with them, which is an im
provement. Several fellows on the
team told me that if they could take
UCLA, they thought they could take
j USC and Cal. Most important, Bob
Burnett's underlings played their
best ball of the season Saturday, and
if they can keep it up —well, ycu
never can tell.
It could be one of the greatest rags
! to riches stories in PCC basketball
history—from the basement to the
i top in two weeks. And as we say,
| Stanford, like the shrimp boat, is
| a'comin'.
