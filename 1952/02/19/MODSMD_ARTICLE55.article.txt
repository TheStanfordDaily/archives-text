Conference {'raised
In praising the conference, von Bib
j ra could only regret that his crowded
! program did not enable him to at
tend more of the speeches and dis
cussions. The discussions on human
rights and college youth were espe
cially interesting, he said.
One speaker, a State Department

| official, in hi i talk on college stu-
I denU, went into great detail about
Stanford's program of aid to the
j Free University of Berlin, praising
this. school for selling u ' fine ex
ample."

ra was Reinhold Niebuhr, professor at

Seminary and vice - chairman of
I the U.S. National Commission for
Niebuhr, in a speech on "The
Moral Requirements of the United
| Nations World,'' said that unless wc
look realistically at the present
threats to world order, "our loyalty"
I (to the principle of wot IJ order)
1 will become "very abstract and very
irrelevant to cut rent history."
Propaganda Bookstore
While in New York City von Bibra
wandered into a Communist distri
bution center near Times Square,
i It was a .mail unobtrusive book and
! phonograph shop which he entered
through various doors and curtains.
The center offered material from all
parts of the world, written in Eng
! lish i:nd printed in magazine form.
von Bibra purchased a sampling of
i different types of propaganda.
These, together With information
he picked up at the UN, the Car
negie institute, and the State De
| pai tmcnt, constitute about 34
pounds of literature which is now
; available in the IfR pamphlet and
document shop. Students who need
source materials for term papers
arc welcome to come in and use it,
he said.
