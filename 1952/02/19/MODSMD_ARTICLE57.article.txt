ll.v RONALD ROSEN
TREASURY <>I IMMORTAL PER
FORMANCES: FAMOUS DUETS
(LCT 1032, Victor)
The greatest share of credit in
making this set must go to the Vic
tor recording engineers who did a
magnificent job of adapting these
duets from old 78-rpm records onto
this long-playing disc. Not only
was the transfer to the .'l.'l' ,'t speed
kilfuliy done, but the quality of the
recordings has been improved in the
process.
It would be a difficult task to try
and single out the most outstanding
performances in this collection, as
they are all excellent. Artists in
cluded are Caruso. Gluck, Farrar,
Gigli, Pinza, McCormack, Bori,
Galli-Curei, Schipa, Scotti, Maiti
nolli, and Journet.
BEETHOVEN: PIANO CONCERTO
No. 1 (Victor LCT lo::7). Artur
Rubinstein, pianist, Royal Phil
harmonic Orrchestra, Sir Thomas
Lleecham, conductor.
Why Victor would want to re
lease this fairly recent recording on
its Immortal Performance Series is
certainly a difficult question for
anyone to answer. Perhaps they
felt that including it in this series
would give the recording an aura
of greatness that would convert it
into a best-seller (which it wasn't
on its 78-rpm pressing of four years
ago).
At. any rate, Rubinstein has his
3ood moments, but these do not
quite offset the effect of his bad
ones. He drops notes here and
there, and at times drives the music
so much that one is no longer con
rious of Beethoven, but only of
Rubinstein. Ho also uses the Saint-
Saens cadenzas, which in this re
viewer's opinion add nothing to the
conecrto ,but rather detract from it.
Although Bcccham handles the
orchestra quite capably, the bal
ance between piano and orchestra
is bad, with the piano getting the
better of it. In a word, the per
formance is not immortal.
