Virlually all life on earth depends on the process called photo
synthesis. Yet, for all of the scientific knowledge lhat has been
accumulated about the subject, it cannot be duplicated industrially
or in the laboratory.
One of the nation's leading authorities in the fundamental sci-

ence of biochemistry will explain
some of I be fact.:? of photosynthesis
tonight at 7;' JO in Memorial Audi
torium.
He is l>r. C. Slacy French, di
rector of (lie Carnegie Institute of
Washington plant biology division
at Stanford. His Tuesday Evening
Lecture is tilled "From Sunshine
to Food by Photosynthesis in
Plants."
For the past 2:5 years the Carnegie
laboratory at Stanford has been at
work on the two important char
acteristics of plant life, their green
color and their ability to adjust
themselves to changing conditions on
earth while maintaining their ca
pacity to manufacture food. Dr.
French has directed the laboratory
since 1047.
It is known that plants since
prehistoric times have converted
the energy «if light into the energy
of food. Much of the research in
(he laboratory is concerned with
pigments, such as the green color
ing matter of leaves which absorb
light, and wilh the means by which
these pigments convert Ihis energy
into chcmical compounds.
Before lie came to the Carnegie
laboratory at Stanford, Dr. French

♦
was already known for his work in
cellular lespiration, the photosyn
thesis of purple bacteria and of green
leaves. _
He was graduated from Harvard
University in 1!)30 and received his
doctorate there in 1!K!1. The fol
lowing year he served as a research
I fellow at the California Institute of
! Technology and then spent a year
studying with Professor Otto War
burg at the Kaiser Wilhehn Insti
tute for Zcllphysiologie in Berlin.
Dr. French then returned to Har
vard as Austin teaching fellow in
biochemistry, leaving in 1938 to ac
cept an in.structorship in chemistry
lat the University of Chicago. In
1941 he went, to the University of
Minnesota to teach in the depart
ment of plant pathology, lie hclil an
associate professorship in the depart
ment when he was appointed director
j of the Carnegie laboratory at Stan-

Dr. Lawrence b\ Blinks, director
of the Hopkins Marine Station, Stan
ford's laboratory for marine biology
at Pacific Grove, will introduce Dr.
French.
the lecture will be open to the

He was graduated from Harvard
University in 1!)30 and received his
doctorate there in 1!K!1. The fol
lowing year he served as a research
I fellow at the California Institute of
! Technology and then spent a year
studying with Professor Otto War
burg at the Kaiser Wilhehn Insti
tute for Zcllphysiologie in Berlin.
Dr. French then returned to Har
vard as Austin teaching fellow in
biochemistry, leaving in 1938 to ac
cept an in.structorship in chemistry
lat the University of Chicago. In
1941 he went, to the University of
Minnesota to teach in the depart
ment of plant pathology, lie hclil an
associate professorship in the depart
ment when he was appointed director
j of the Carnegie laboratory at Stan-
| ford.
Dr. Lawrence b\ Blinks, director
of the Hopkins Marine Station, Stan
ford's laboratory for marine biology
at Pacific Grove, will introduce Dr.
French.
the lecture will be open to the
public without charge.
Virlually all life on earth depends on the process called photo
synthesis. Yet, for all of the scientific knowledge lhat has been
accumulated about the subject, it cannot be duplicated industrially
or in the laboratory.
One of the nation's leading authorities in the fundamental sci-

ence of biochemistry will explain
some of I be fact.:? of photosynthesis
tonight at 7;' JO in Memorial Audi
torium.
He is l>r. C. Slacy French, di
rector of (lie Carnegie Institute of
Washington plant biology division
at Stanford. His Tuesday Evening
Lecture is tilled "From Sunshine
to Food by Photosynthesis in
Plants."
For the past 2:5 years the Carnegie
laboratory at Stanford has been at
work on the two important char
acteristics of plant life, their green
color and their ability to adjust
themselves to changing conditions on
earth while maintaining their ca
pacity to manufacture food. Dr.
French has directed the laboratory
since 1047.
It is known that plants since
prehistoric times have converted
the energy «if light into the energy
of food. Much of the research in
(he laboratory is concerned with
pigments, such as the green color
ing matter of leaves which absorb
light, and wilh the means by which
these pigments convert Ihis energy
into chcmical compounds.

laboratory at Stanford, Dr. French

cellular lespiration, the photosyn
thesis of purple bacteria and of green
leaves. _
