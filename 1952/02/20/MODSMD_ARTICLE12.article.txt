The importance of radiation from
the sun and the process of photo
synthesis in plants on future .supplies
of power and food was explained to
last night's Tuesday Evening Series
audience by Dr. Charles Stacey
French, director of the Carnegie In
stitution of Washington plant biology
division at Stanford.
In developing liis topic, 'In in
Sunshine to loihl by Photosyn
thesis in Plants," he explained
that i:i addition to lb" theoretical
science involved in the process of
photosynthesis there is an aspect
of the greatest practical impor
tance. He demonstrated many of
his main points with slides.
"Our reserves of co;il and oil are
being depleted, and eventually dif
ferent sources of power will be
needed. Atomic power is one source,
but a great abundance of solar en
ergy will have tj be utilized,"
stated Dr. trench.
He said that no chemical system
out id o of green plant . has been
able yet to use (lie sun's energy ef
fectively. One and one-half square
miles of the earth's surface receives
per day approximately the same
amount of energy as that released
by an atomic bomb.
Dr. French explained that we
need more food as will as more
energy because of the large num
bers of people who are going
hungry in the world today.
"Since the expansion ol land is
limited, the frontier is not a geo
graphical one hut one of science and
technology," lie said.
The scientist told of (wo major
projects lo (ry (o develop move
food. The first is the extensive
growth of single-ccllcd aVuae. The
other is (!)<â€¢ development of here
tofore unused grasses into food
products.
The Carnegie Institution of Wash
ington was begun in under an
endowment from Andrew Carnegie.
The main headquarters are in
Washington, D.C., with departments
in universities all over the country.
