# AIR RAID PRACTICE
## Campus to Be Alerted Today 
### 
At about 10:15 this morning the
Stanford fire whistle will sound the
Rod Alert as part of a eo-ordinated
air raid practice throughout the Bay
Area and Penin ;ula.
The ; lert will consist of a series
of short blast., for three minutes,
meaning thai enemy bombers are in
the vicinity. Shortly after the Rod
Alert, the All Clear will be sounded.
This will be three steady blasts of
one minute's duration, with two
minute intervals.
Oakland and San Francisco are
holding all-out air raid tests, as
Stanford did last year.
7'hc reason for not repeating last
year's practice, according to Philip
Duffy, Civil Defense chief at Stan
ford, i.s that the confusion it would
cause would not be worth the
trouble, it. would be impossible for
the campus police to stop all the
cars driving on campus.
Even though Stanford is not hold
ing an all-out test today, DufTy said
the possibility exists of having a
drill in the spring.
