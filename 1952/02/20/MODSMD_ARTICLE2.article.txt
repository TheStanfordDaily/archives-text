## Warren Announces Entry Into Wisconsin Primary 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 19 (UP)â€”Gov. Earl Warren of California
said today he will actively campaign for the Republican Presiden
tial nomination in Wisconsin and will enter that state's April 1
primary.
In Wisconsin, Warren's entry into the primary was welcomed by

supporters of Gen. Dwight D. Ei
senhower, but the news was re
ceived without comment by backers
of other candidates.
State Sen. Bernhard Gettelman,
an Eisenhower committeeman, said
Warren had made no commitments
to throw in his lot with that of Ei
senhower. But apparently in view
of the fact that Warren and Eisen
hower agree fundamentally on sev
eral important issues, Eisenhower
supporters believe Warren is the
best man to back in the absence of
the general's name on the ticket.
