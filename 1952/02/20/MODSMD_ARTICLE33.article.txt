### PETE GROTHE 
FOR A BETTER STANFORD: COUNSELLING
AND C.t'IDANCE l ENIER, AND ) AC 11, TV
RATING SHEETS
The problem of Counselling and Guidance Center
facilities ties in with the advising system, which I
discussed yesb rday. The minute a lower division
adviser sees a student at all in doubt about bis major,
he should vigorously encourage him to go to the
Center.
The Center gives, the student a $H() service for $1 —
a service which may shape his whole future.
Dr. McDaniel, former state director til counselling
and guidance, told me that Pasadena City College has
I'J full time counsellors, while Stanford has the
equivalent ol four, lie also added: "Junior colleges

are really making more use of
scientific methods in the task of
aiding students to plan wisely
than liberal arts colleges. Some
junioi colleges at which 1 have
dqne surveys put 10 per cent of
their educational funds into
counselling."
Right now, roughly five per
cent ol the students take advan
tage of the Guidance and Coun
selling Center services. Fifty per

• ent should. The solution to the problem of expanded
lacilities is as complex as it is easy.
It's complex, because the only thing holding up
the expansion is lack of money. It's easy, because
(according to Dean YViubigler) if enough students
demand the services (he funds will come. In other
words, it works on a supply and demand basis.
Faculty rating by students is something about
which I feel very strongly.
If a person go< s into teaching, it's only good horse
sense that he should use eveiv device at his disposal
to improve his teaching, One of the best devices is
a faculty rating sheet, to be seen only by the pro
lessor himself and not. to be signed by the student.
Dr Robert Bush of the education department, a man
for whom 1 have the utmost respect, said, "If 1 had
one criterion by which to judge my teaching, it would
be ori the basis of the faculty rating sheets. It
wouldn't be the only criterion, mind you, but if would
be the most important.

Some faculty members arc squeamish at,(tut hav
ing students nil*- them. 'I hey feel (hat il would l»s*-
ciiiiii' u personality contest, ami that students bear
ing grudges would (idte il «>ial in (hi* rating slot-is.
Also, many (fathers, being In.man brings, don't
lila* crdicism from uudergrads.
The faculty rating by students would have some
weaknesses, true, but not enough in prevent if from
becoming a real aid in impioving teaching method:;.
My proposal is to have the University prepare the
rating sheet, something on the oider of I'm due's very
successful sheet. 11 would vary slightly for the var
ious departments. On these sheets, tiie students would
rate the professor as a teacher, give a constructive
criticism of the course, and tell how both llu- course
and the teaching can be improved.
A system such as this would keep the profe s.or: on
their toes. It would induce them to keep the course
fresh and up-to date. You and 1 both know (he typ;>
of professor that reads his lectures from yellowed
notes, lb' gives the same couise year after year with
out bothering to employ new methods or current
events.
Of (he 13 educators ! interviewed, each one agreed
tha( there should lie a system of family rating or
that he himself was always willing to submit to one.
And yet there ate many who arc afraid ol the truth
that their courses and (« aching need improvement.
1 thought at first that faculty rating sheet:; should
be compulsory, but 1 have modified my opinion.
Compulsory fatuity rating shed- would produce a
negative attitude on the pail of the professors and
might destroy some ol the iriendly :;!.ud"nt faculty
relationship that exists at Stanford.
On the other I jand, the faculty members should
discuss the problem anion;' themselves and the Uni
versity should make the sheets available In those
who want to use them Professors should be strongly
encouraged by both the administration and fellow
professors to use the sheets II enough have the stu
dents rate them, social pressure will force the rest
to follow suit, but the first step is to have the Uni
versity make the sheets available.
If a person goes into teaching, upposedly to devote
his life's work to students, then be should be willing
to listen to those whom he is trying to help.
