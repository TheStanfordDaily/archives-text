# In Agreement With Grothe
## 
### 
To the Editor:
As ;i graduate of Stanford, I would like to ndd my
100 per cent approval of Pete Grothe's arguments con
cerning emphasis on teaching rather th;m iesearcli
and a better lower division advising system.
I know that I express the opinion ol many of tho> e
in my class. Many of Stanford'' outstanding educators
are still in the lower ranks. I'm talking about many
of those who are excellent teacher:, real a:-sets to
the University, hut who haven't hoen promoted as
fast as the dull lecturers who have don" some writing.
In regard to the adviser system, I floundered around
quite a bit, mainly because my lower division adviser
didn't seem interested enough to giv( me one bit of
advice.
Mr. Grothe has done a very scholarly iob in Ins
treatment of the two subjects. I hope his article::
result in some action.
