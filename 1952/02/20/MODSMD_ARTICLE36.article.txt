## Berlin Economy in ‘Sad State’ 
### 
(Editor's n«»1 112 I*lli] Nielsen, Stanford Kn;fliririf***
Scho) »r at !h»' hif University of Berlin, concludes
it is discussion of the ectinoiriic problems of the
former Gernuni capital in this third and final part of
a titter he wrote l>cr 2!t to the Stanford student
body.)
Commerce is severely hampered by the two-money
system which prevails between Fast, and West Ger
many. Only in East Berlin is it possible to purchase
with East Marks which have a value in exchange
'hops of about one-fourth of a West German Mark,
the only valid currency in West Berlin. Because of
the favorable exchange rate, many West Berliners
purchase East Marks and, w r ith terrific personal ad
vantage, go shopping in (he Blast. This action, how
ever, i to the direct detriment of West Berlin shop
keepers who cannot possibly compete on this price
basis and who are therefore forced out. of business.
By the practice of suddenly dumping huge quan
tities of goods on the Kast Berlin market, the crafty
Russians succeed in depressing prices there lower
and lower, thus draining life and competitive abil
ity rapidly away from West Berlin. And as a spe
• ial Christmas tactic 1 his year, the Reds sank prices
in their state-owned ictail stores (which strongly
predominate in Fast Berlin) from 15 to 50 per cent!
Naturally the West Berlin Senate attempts to con
trol buying by Westerners in the Kast by stopping
all ears entering the West from the Fast and by
questioning on West bound subways and buses
persons with tilled market baskets.
Successful marketing ol Berlin goods in West Ger
many is painfully handicapped. The distance from
Berlin to the Federal Republic through the Russian
Zone adds high transportation costs not faced at all
by West German firm, trading in the West. Soviet

controls on the borders always slow up traffic, halt
much for no good reason, and prohibit other goods
from moving at all. We now have, for example, a
crippling coal shortage in Berlin due to nonsensical
Russian border controls. Even when one completely
avoids land transport in favor ol the more expensive
air shipment, it is a long wait for available planes.
The result of all these obstacles is shown clearly
by the statement of a friend of mine who owns a
large chain of food stores in Berlin: "Since the end
of the blockade in I?I4S, I have not been able to send
a single shipment of goods to West Germany on
time according to my contracts, because of Soviet
transportation tie-ups." Dealers in West Germany
would obviously prefer to do business where orders
are promptly delivered.
Regardless of what is rightly said every day about
maintaining Berlin as a "show window of freedom
behind the Iron Curtain," we should not lose sight of
what a task this entails in the long run. Ti ue, the
West Berliners for their part are endowed wilh a
magnificent sense of courage and zeal to suvive in
the face of their hardships. Since l!)4!> they have
wrought a great deal and even now their index of
industrial productivity stands at 90 per cent of the
1930 level.
But the hundreds of thousands still jobless in
West Berlin and tlx sad stale of tin* economy there
give the lieds a priceless propaganda weapon
against the capitalistic Western wa> of life. The
incentive for large West Berlin firms to persevere
and continue losing capital in this somewhat of a
sinkhole is not too attractive over time. In tbe face
of Soviet designs on Berlin, thai flighty and indis
pensable prerequisite ol a healthy capitalism con
lidence- is extremely dillieult to fostei ainon< West
Germans who have money to invest,
