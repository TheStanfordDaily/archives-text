# ‘Death of Salesman’ Called ‘Great Movie’
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
The Stanley Kramer production of Arthur Miller's "Death of a
Salesman" is currently showing at the Park Theater and the Laurel
in San Carlos. Because of politics—politics, however, which are
entirely apart from and in no way apparent in the film itself —cer
tain national publications have criticized it in a most unfair and

disgraceful manner. 4
Tli" fuel is that "Death of a Sales
man ' is almo.' I as greal a picture
as it was a piny.
The tragedy of Willie Lornan is
not that of a threat man destroyed
by his greatness, ft is the tragedy
of a little man condemned to the
realization of his own smallness.
All liis life, like all of lis, lie
has survived on a dream—thai he !
is important, essential, not merely
liked, l»u( well liked. Now, al the
age of (ill, he begins to see through ,
himself.
Tin sustaining smiles of his cus-

t. o m ers are
gone, lie is for
gotten, the
world seems to
spin on very
well without
him. The values
he has instilled
in his sons —
feelings of su

example, are brilliantly imagina
tive, liee from the stiffness of con
ventional flashbacks and differing
from the transitions of the play in
a fashion more suitable to the film
medium.
As Willie Loman, Fredric Match
I turns in the performance of the
| year. II in his earlier scenes he is
not quite so subtle as l.ee J. Cobb
and Thomas Mitchell wtvc in the
play, he nevertheless bring!, us all
{ (he fear and pity of this man who

pride broken, his exhaustion
; overwhelming.
Mildred Dunnock, as his wife
Linda, is also excellent. Deftly un
derplaying her role, she is in strik
l ing contrast to Willie. And Kevin
McCarthy deserves an Academy
Award for his sensitive portrayal of
the tortured, confused Biff.
Audience reaction to the pic
ture is interesting. There is a
certain amount of unwarranted
laughter, but it is not amused nor
j belittling. Rather, it is unsure,
ii» rvmis laughter, a release for the
! keyed-up emotions of those who
are not used to greatness on the
| screen.
| For "Death of a Salesman" is
I tragedy, and !o be understood must
he viewed as such. Still, it is not
depressing, hut ennobling. Like all
great tragedy, it sends you from the
j theater cleansed, knowing a little
| better what, it is to be a human
j being.

a worthless woman-chafer, Biff into
a tormented drifter.
A Willie drives his ear over the
pavements ol liis New England ter
ritory, his mind wanders, searching
the past for his mistakes. When he
is fired, that is the last straw.
Willie Loman was not a great
man. Hut at heart he was a good
man. liis dream was the wrong
dream, and when lie realized this,
he was willing to die by that
dream.
Where Elia Kazan's overly-literal
adaptation of "A Streetcar Named
Desire" emerged 'm trie movie as
little more than a photographed
staj-e production, Stanley Kramer's
"Salesman" takes on a screen iden
tity all it ; own. The transitions from
present to past and back again, for
