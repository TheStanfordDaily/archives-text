# Wrestlers Will Face Bears in Final Match
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
Stanford's varsity grapplers, near
full .strength for the first time this
year, meet Cal here tonight in their
last and most important match of
the season.
In their previous meet with the
Bears earlier in the season, the
Cards suffered a 30 to G setback.
Cal, co-champ of the PCC last year,
took five pins and a forfeit to SU's
two decisions.
Oliver Lyons, out with a bad
shoulder all season, is starting in
the KM-lb. class for the second time
this quarter. While still hindered
by his shoulder and lack of prac
tice, Ollie should give Cal's Julian
Sanders a rough match.
In the 1117-pound class, George
Ihr oil, also out of the previous Cal
meet, will meet Hay Castenada in
another tough match.
At 147, Bob Jessen will go against
Gene Theios, one of Cal's best men,
and will enter the meet an under
do;. 1 ,. Theios got a pin on Jessen
their last time out.
Either Ken James or Bruce Bai
h>y will go for Stanford in the 157
da .s against Cal's Dick Will. WiLt
pinned Bailey in the last meet, and

James will probably get the nod
to start.
Pat Madden, a lithe lG7~pounder
and one of the best wrestlers on the
team, will face Bob Henke again.
Madden decisioned Henke in the
previous meeting, and if he has im
proved enough since to pin him,
Stanford chanes will go up.
Jack Ogelsby goes against Bentley
Lyon in the 177-pound class. Lyon
is probably the outstanding wrestler
on the Cal team. He took the PCC
title last year, is captain of the
team, and stands a good chance to
make the Olympics. Ogelsby was
pinned in their last meeting.
Both Rod Garner and Phil Wilson
have been trading off chores in the
heavy department, and the exact
starter has not been decided. Gar
ner dccisioned Cal's heavy, Pay
Mosten, and a pin this time will be
helpful.
For lack of a 124-pounder, Stan
ford will again have to forfeit this
event, and Cal will get five free
points.
First match of the evening will
be the 130-pound event starting at
7. The matches will be held in the
Men's Gym.
