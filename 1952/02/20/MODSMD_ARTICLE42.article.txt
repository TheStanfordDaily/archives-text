Block S lootball letters were awarded at a recent Excom meeting and a
i fairly good rhubarb developed over the situation. I et's take a little look
at the letter award problem and see what cooks. (The award winners
are listed elsewhere on this page.)
Here on tho Farm we have student government, and the ASSU Execu
tive Committee members are top dogs. These annually elected excomers
take care of all student body business, in-

eluding the awarding of athletic letters. It is
a rather unique system, and a good one, I
think.
But like all student government, it tends
t ) become a little rigid and too inflexible. It
also seems to be the practice to have ru'?s
and regulations in writing for everything.
Along these lines, there are several para
graphs on award regulations in the By-Laws
to the ASSU Constitution.
There are two broad schools of thought
when it comes to letter awarding. The
"Liberal School" says give the awards to
everybody who comes out for a sport and
really makes an effort to play the game. In

otnt» wotua, uw icuci should be given on the basis of interest and work,
not merely ability.
The old-time, "Conservative School" claims that letters should be
awarded to only those men who display certain ability and playing quali
fications. In their opinion, the Block S should really stand for excellence
J in athletics, while representing Stanford in competition.
Now that I enjoy sitting on any fences or taking the middle-of-the-road
j position, but I feel the letter award can be made in several compromise
I or combination instances. The Block S should not be handed out like
parking tickets. That's to everybody and it would lo.se all value. Stanford
has a great sports history and any wearer of the S should have made a real
I contribution to that history.
There are special cases like injuries and continual efforts by a man
without the greatest abilities over a long time. There are also men who
add a lot through spirit. These competitors do add to the Stanford sports
tradition for they display the determination and hard-work that is re
-1 quired of any winning team.
Block 6 S* Requirements
Now back to the Constitution and how the Stanfords have the award
system set-up. Accordingly, football, basketball, baseball, track, tennis,
swimming, and golf have been designated the major sports. And Block S
is the award in major sports.
From the book: "A Block S shall be awarded in football to:
"(a) any man who has played ten minutes of the Stanford-California
football game; or . . .
"(b) any man who has played fifteen minutes in the Southern Cali
fornia-Stanford game or fifteen minutes in a post-season or intersectional
game; or . ..
"(c) any man who has played not less than ten minutes in two Con
ference football games other than the California football game and whose
total playing time amounts to sixty minutes; or . . .
"(d) any man. who has been a member of the varsity football squad
for a minimum of two years, who is a senior, and who, by loyalty, general
deportment, and adherence to all regulations has proved himself worthy
and shown sufficient ability to win the unanimous vote of the head foot
hall coach, the Director of Athletics, and the Executive Committee."
These are the standards set up for football. There are similar standards
for track, basketball and the rest of the sports. In each case the emphasis
is placed on scoring against Cal, the big rival, and USC, the traditionally
strong. Supplementing these qualifications are rules for injuries and na
tional champions.
After a season is over, the head coach, with the Director of Athletics'
approval, sends in his list of qualified squad members as a recommenda
tion to the Executive Committee. The Excom rubber stamps the awards
and that's it.
This year thirty-three Varsity footballers qualified for Block S's
under paragraphs a. b, or c of the Constitution. In addition, three men
received injury awards and iwo under the "senior" classification. Still
there were nine men left in a questionable position.
Quick Taylor Goes to Bat
Chuck Taylor, being the kind of coach and man that he is, went to bat
for these deserving guys. According to Chuck, "our use of the complete
platoon system this year made it much more difficult for these men to earn
an award tinder the existing rules."
Seven players were members of the Rose Bowl team and played in the
Pasadena game, but not enough. Nor did they play enough all season.
Chuck asked for special Blocks. This was granted. The other two, frosh,
were kept on the Varsity for use from time to time, and thus were "de
prived of the opportunity of earning the Junior Varsity award." Excom
okayed the two letters.
Coach-of-the-Year Taylor has carried the fight one step further. He
has talked with Student Body I'rexy Wayne Alley and other student
members on the SAB. After more talks-, the group will most likely
submit some changes in the requirements for awarding letters.
I go along with this idea of liberalizing the rules. The way the game
is played today it is often difficult for second-stringers to get in enough
time. Standards should be made and adhered to, but they should be
flexible enough for a coach to give a deserving competitor his letter.
In the past, the senior with two years of effort has been an adequate
j enough loop-hole. But not now, and these new changes should provide the
| needed improvement.

really makes an effort to play the game. In

The old-time, "Conservative School" claims that letters should be
awarded to only those men who display certain ability and playing quali
fications. In their opinion, the Block S should really stand for excellence
J in athletics, while representing Stanford in competition.
Now that I enjoy sitting on any fences or taking the middle-of-the-road
j position, but I feel the letter award can be made in several compromise
I or combination instances. The Block S should not be handed out like
parking tickets. That's to everybody and it would lo.se all value. Stanford
has a great sports history and any wearer of the S should have made a real
I contribution to that history.
There are special cases like injuries and continual efforts by a man
without the greatest abilities over a long time. There are also men who
add a lot through spirit. These competitors do add to the Stanford sports
tradition for they display the determination and hard-work that is re
-1 quired of any winning team.
Block 6 S* Requirements
Now back to the Constitution and how the Stanfords have the award
system set-up. Accordingly, football, basketball, baseball, track, tennis,
swimming, and golf have been designated the major sports. And Block S
is the award in major sports.
From the book: "A Block S shall be awarded in football to:
"(a) any man who has played ten minutes of the Stanford-California
football game; or . . .
"(b) any man who has played fifteen minutes in the Southern Cali
fornia-Stanford game or fifteen minutes in a post-season or intersectional
game; or . ..
"(c) any man who has played not less than ten minutes in two Con
ference football games other than the California football game and whose
total playing time amounts to sixty minutes; or . . .
"(d) any man. who has been a member of the varsity football squad
for a minimum of two years, who is a senior, and who, by loyalty, general
deportment, and adherence to all regulations has proved himself worthy
and shown sufficient ability to win the unanimous vote of the head foot
hall coach, the Director of Athletics, and the Executive Committee."
These are the standards set up for football. There are similar standards
for track, basketball and the rest of the sports. In each case the emphasis
is placed on scoring against Cal, the big rival, and USC, the traditionally
strong. Supplementing these qualifications are rules for injuries and na
tional champions.
After a season is over, the head coach, with the Director of Athletics'
approval, sends in his list of qualified squad members as a recommenda
tion to the Executive Committee. The Excom rubber stamps the awards
and that's it.
This year thirty-three Varsity footballers qualified for Block S's
under paragraphs a. b, or c of the Constitution. In addition, three men
received injury awards and iwo under the "senior" classification. Still
there were nine men left in a questionable position.
Quick Taylor Goes to Bat
Chuck Taylor, being the kind of coach and man that he is, went to bat
for these deserving guys. According to Chuck, "our use of the complete
platoon system this year made it much more difficult for these men to earn
an award tinder the existing rules."
Seven players were members of the Rose Bowl team and played in the
Pasadena game, but not enough. Nor did they play enough all season.
Chuck asked for special Blocks. This was granted. The other two, frosh,
were kept on the Varsity for use from time to time, and thus were "de
prived of the opportunity of earning the Junior Varsity award." Excom
okayed the two letters.
Coach-of-the-Year Taylor has carried the fight one step further. He
has talked with Student Body I'rexy Wayne Alley and other student
members on the SAB. After more talks-, the group will most likely
submit some changes in the requirements for awarding letters.
I go along with this idea of liberalizing the rules. The way the game
is played today it is often difficult for second-stringers to get in enough
time. Standards should be made and adhered to, but they should be
flexible enough for a coach to give a deserving competitor his letter.
In the past, the senior with two years of effort has been an adequate
j enough loop-hole. But not now, and these new changes should provide the
| needed improvement.

Block S lootball letters were awarded at a recent Excom meeting and a
i fairly good rhubarb developed over the situation. I et's take a little look
at the letter award problem and see what cooks. (The award winners
are listed elsewhere on this page.)
Here on tho Farm we have student government, and the ASSU Execu
tive Committee members are top dogs. These annually elected excomers
take care of all student body business, in-

eluding the awarding of athletic letters. It is
a rather unique system, and a good one, I
think.
But like all student government, it tends
t ) become a little rigid and too inflexible. It
also seems to be the practice to have ru'?s
and regulations in writing for everything.
Along these lines, there are several para
graphs on award regulations in the By-Laws
to the ASSU Constitution.
There are two broad schools of thought
when it comes to letter awarding. The
"Liberal School" says give the awards to

add a lot through spirit. These competitors do add to the Stanford sports
tradition for they display the determination and hard-work that is re

Block 6 S* Requirements
Now back to the Constitution and how the Stanfords have the award
system set-up. Accordingly, football, basketball, baseball, track, tennis,
swimming, and golf have been designated the major sports. And Block S
is the award in major sports.
From the book: "A Block S shall be awarded in football to:
"(a) any man who has played ten minutes of the Stanford-California
football game; or . . .
"(b) any man who has played fifteen minutes in the Southern Cali
fornia-Stanford game or fifteen minutes in a post-season or intersectional
game; or . ..
"(c) any man who has played not less than ten minutes in two Con
ference football games other than the California football game and whose
total playing time amounts to sixty minutes; or . . .
"(d) any man. who has been a member of the varsity football squad
for a minimum of two years, who is a senior, and who, by loyalty, general
deportment, and adherence to all regulations has proved himself worthy
and shown sufficient ability to win the unanimous vote of the head foot
hall coach, the Director of Athletics, and the Executive Committee."
These are the standards set up for football. There are similar standards
for track, basketball and the rest of the sports. In each case the emphasis
is placed on scoring against Cal, the big rival, and USC, the traditionally
strong. Supplementing these qualifications are rules for injuries and na
tional champions.
After a season is over, the head coach, with the Director of Athletics'
approval, sends in his list of qualified squad members as a recommenda
tion to the Executive Committee. The Excom rubber stamps the awards
and that's it.
This year thirty-three Varsity footballers qualified for Block S's
under paragraphs a. b, or c of the Constitution. In addition, three men
received injury awards and iwo under the "senior" classification. Still
there were nine men left in a questionable position.
Quick Taylor Goes to Bat
Chuck Taylor, being the kind of coach and man that he is, went to bat
for these deserving guys. According to Chuck, "our use of the complete
platoon system this year made it much more difficult for these men to earn
an award tinder the existing rules."
Seven players were members of the Rose Bowl team and played in the
Pasadena game, but not enough. Nor did they play enough all season.
Chuck asked for special Blocks. This was granted. The other two, frosh,
were kept on the Varsity for use from time to time, and thus were "de
prived of the opportunity of earning the Junior Varsity award." Excom
okayed the two letters.
Coach-of-the-Year Taylor has carried the fight one step further. He
has talked with Student Body I'rexy Wayne Alley and other student
members on the SAB. After more talks-, the group will most likely
submit some changes in the requirements for awarding letters.
I go along with this idea of liberalizing the rules. The way the game
is played today it is often difficult for second-stringers to get in enough
time. Standards should be made and adhered to, but they should be
flexible enough for a coach to give a deserving competitor his letter.
In the past, the senior with two years of effort has been an adequate
j enough loop-hole. But not now, and these new changes should provide the
| needed improvement.

Block S lootball letters were awarded at a recent Excom meeting and a
i fairly good rhubarb developed over the situation. I et's take a little look
at the letter award problem and see what cooks. (The award winners
are listed elsewhere on this page.)
Here on tho Farm we have student government, and the ASSU Execu
tive Committee members are top dogs. These annually elected excomers
take care of all student body business, in-

eluding the awarding of athletic letters. It is
a rather unique system, and a good one, I
think.
But like all student government, it tends
t ) become a little rigid and too inflexible. It
also seems to be the practice to have ru'?s
and regulations in writing for everything.
Along these lines, there are several para
graphs on award regulations in the By-Laws
to the ASSU Constitution.
There are two broad schools of thought
when it comes to letter awarding. The
"Liberal School" says give the awards to
everybody who comes out for a sport and
really makes an effort to play the game. In

otnt» wotua, uw icuci should be given on the basis of interest and work,
not merely ability.
The old-time, "Conservative School" claims that letters should be
awarded to only those men who display certain ability and playing quali
fications. In their opinion, the Block S should really stand for excellence
J in athletics, while representing Stanford in competition.
Now that I enjoy sitting on any fences or taking the middle-of-the-road
j position, but I feel the letter award can be made in several compromise
I or combination instances. The Block S should not be handed out like
parking tickets. That's to everybody and it would lo.se all value. Stanford
has a great sports history and any wearer of the S should have made a real
I contribution to that history.
