## 
### 
Toyon Chez took a hard-fought
21-18 victory from Encina 4E last
night in intramural basketball.
Toyon led 10-G at half-time, and
held the lead throughout the second
half, despite the fine play of En
cina's Jack Randolf who potted
j seven final-period points.
Encina never led, but late in the
| game twice got within one point,
j However, in each case Chez's Bob
j Burdick got away for baskets to
keep his team within a safe lead.
Outstanding for the winners was
j Paul Norgaard, who time and again

broke up Encinn fast-break plays or
else intercepted passes at crucial
moments.
The first game of the evening was
won by El Toro, as they slapped
down a hapless El Capitan squad
41-14. The El Toros were paced in
scoring by Bob Diskinson, who pot
ted five field goals and a charity for
11 points, and Larry Calm, who
dropped in five field goals for 10
digits.
The Toros took an early lead in
the game and were never in any
fear of losing.
