I ways said yesterday that heavy,

wind-driven snow closed U.S. '10

hopes of an early opening of U.S.

The Highway Division would

approaching the North Pacific Coast
and should reach the Sacramento
Valley and Sierra Nevadas today.

reau said. "The snow is apt to thin
out a bit today, and not be so heavy
—but it will keep snowing."
