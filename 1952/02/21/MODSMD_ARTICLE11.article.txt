# 'Hashers' Perturb Diners
## Profs Serve; Mishaps Rife 
### MARY MASSEY 
"Strike! Strike!" This was the
| cry of Lathrop's five neophyte
hashers last night as they pick
eted the house's dinner table
with placards asking, "Are we
mice or men?"
Booed back to the kitchen, the
recalcitrants began serving the
drinks. But Hasher Claude Buss
slipped and crashed to the floor,
spilling milk and breaking bottles.
Lathrop girls adjusted the shoulder
towels they had worn to dinner as a
precaution and waited for the next
course.
Meanwhile, similar scenes were
taking place at four other campus
dining halls as the top donors to
the all-foreign relief drive were
served dinner bv their favorite
members of the faculty.
At Rohle, corridors 2C and 3 Cen
ter, which donated most in the hall,
were presented with a special scroll
by their new hashers.
Hashers at Village Buildings 121

and 1/3 received a poem outlining i
their "duties."
At El Toro, Hasher Richard Balch I
(in a moment of carelessness) doused
an unsuspecting eating club member |
with a pitcher of ice water.
The "hashers for a night" who
served the Kappa Sigs were given
trick hats and "rather" small trays
on which to bus the dishes.
Lathrop House, which contributed
the highest per capita to the relief j
drive — $5.53 — tried to make their
hashers feel at home. Books were
piled down the middle of the dining
room table, while bluebooks served
as place mats. On a blackboard were
written the words: "This table waited
on—entree, 50 per cent; dessert, 30
per cent; coffee, 20 per cent. Will
Claude Buss and Stuart Green check
with reader."
Signs pasted on the dining room
walls gave the words the faculty
hashers "live by." "Get it first, but
get it right!" proclaimed Hasher Clif
ford Weigle's sign. Hasher Carl Run
ning's sign said, "When you're shoot
ing dice v/ith strangers, always use
the backboard."
"When you go to Paris on your
honeymoon — " read Hasher Georges
Lematirc's sign. On Hasher Graham
Stuart's sign were the words, "The

treaty was signed, not ratified!''
Rohle hashers were: the Rev.
Robert M. Miuto, Dr. David Refi
nery, J Jr. Graham DuShane, Dr.
Margaret ('. Barr, Miss l\lva Fay
Brown, Dr. Harold M. Bacon, Mi s
Christine Kicker, Dr. Harold <

ius E. Shuchat and Dr. Henry
Blauth.


ANOTHER HASHER BITES THE DUST—Dr. Claude Buss, who normally makes his living as pro
fessor of history, stepped out into a new profession last night as hasher al Lathrop House. He
stepped too far, however, and went sliding along the floor, to the amusement of the Lathrop resi
dents. . —Daily photo by Jay Bccker

ANOTHER HASHER BITES THE DUST—Dr. Claude Buss, who normally makes his living as pro
fessor of history, stepped out into a new profession last night as hasher al Lathrop House. He
stepped too far, however, and went sliding along the floor, to the amusement of the Lathrop resi
dents. . —Daily photo by Jay Bccker
"Strike! Strike!" This was the
| cry of Lathrop's five neophyte
hashers last night as they pick
eted the house's dinner table
with placards asking, "Are we
mice or men?"
Booed back to the kitchen, the
recalcitrants began serving the
drinks. But Hasher Claude Buss
slipped and crashed to the floor,
spilling milk and breaking bottles.
Lathrop girls adjusted the shoulder
towels they had worn to dinner as a
precaution and waited for the next
course.
Meanwhile, similar scenes were
taking place at four other campus
dining halls as the top donors to
the all-foreign relief drive were
served dinner bv their favorite
members of the faculty.
At Rohle, corridors 2C and 3 Cen
ter, which donated most in the hall,
were presented with a special scroll
by their new hashers.
Hashers at Village Buildings 121

and 1/3 received a poem outlining i
their "duties."
At El Toro, Hasher Richard Balch I
(in a moment of carelessness) doused
an unsuspecting eating club member |
with a pitcher of ice water.
The "hashers for a night" who
served the Kappa Sigs were given
trick hats and "rather" small trays
on which to bus the dishes.
Lathrop House, which contributed
the highest per capita to the relief j
drive — $5.53 — tried to make their
hashers feel at home. Books were
piled down the middle of the dining
room table, while bluebooks served
as place mats. On a blackboard were
written the words: "This table waited
on—entree, 50 per cent; dessert, 30
per cent; coffee, 20 per cent. Will
Claude Buss and Stuart Green check
with reader."
Signs pasted on the dining room
walls gave the words the faculty
hashers "live by." "Get it first, but
get it right!" proclaimed Hasher Clif
ford Weigle's sign. Hasher Carl Run
ning's sign said, "When you're shoot
ing dice v/ith strangers, always use
the backboard."
"When you go to Paris on your
honeymoon — " read Hasher Georges
Lematirc's sign. On Hasher Graham
Stuart's sign were the words, "The

treaty was signed, not ratified!''
Rohle hashers were: the Rev.
Robert M. Miuto, Dr. David Refi
nery, J Jr. Graham DuShane, Dr.
Margaret ('. Barr, Miss l\lva Fay
Brown, Dr. Harold M. Bacon, Mi s
