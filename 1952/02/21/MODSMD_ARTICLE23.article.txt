# A 						'Com' Bureaucracy at Stanford
## 
### 
There has been a lot of criticism lately that a
sort of miniature bureacuracy is springing up
at Stanford. Nothing new, but the complaints
seem to bo getting louder. The "100 many
corns" complaint and jokes about "Com-c&m"
are becoming frequent bull session fodder.
There's nothing wrong with the mere mul
tiplicity of organizations. Socially, psycho
logically, it's natural that many form, perhaps
even more so at a university than outside.
It is when organizations assume impractical
functions or become inactive except nomi
nally; or when two or more begin lo overlap
in function and duplicate each other's efforts
thai the situation gets out of hand.
While Exccm's constitution committee ap
pears to be an alert one, it may be overlook
ing one important aspect of its jobâ€”that of
checking the extent of organizations' over
lapping and inactivity.
The YWCA workshop March 8 will consider
these problems among others, but the loot of
any tangled organizational trees lies with Ex
com, which originally charters campus organ
izations}.
Recently it voided some fourteen defunct
organizations. But the action was based on
inactivity in the sense that the groups failed to
hold meetings or failed to make transactions
through the ASSU student organization fund.
What about committees and organizations
that are active in these senses but actually ac
complish little in a real sense?
What about, for example, the Public Rela
tions Committee?
This organization was established a year ago,
ostensibly to aid student groups with public
relations details and co-ordinate publicity. It
doesn't seem to be doing that now. it is busy
in a sense. It moves around, uses the student
organization fund, gets a slice of the budget,
but what does it accomplish in a public rela
tions role?
Not a great deal as far as we can find out.
The committee began on a temporary, experi
mental basis lor a one-year period.
After a year it was to report to Excom on
its activities, and Excom was to decide if the
eflort was worth continuing. The year has
elapsed. The report item has been on Ex
corn's agenda and dropped. It was noticeably
absent the last two years, v/hen Excom's
business has been unusually heavy.

A good deal of the trouble on the committee
lias been lack of help. Its director has been
running a virtual one-man show, which was
not intended at the beginning when the
Relations Committee was established to per
form a function considerably larger than it now
performs.
Let's hear the report, and if the committee
isn't doing what it was chartered to do, which
it apparently isn't, void it or veer it back on the
course.
An example of an organization with tenden
cies, once instituted, to overlap functions al
ready carried out is the newly revived Axe
Society, due to come up for approval soon.
The society is a revival of a previous organi
zation with the same name but different func
tion.
The old Axe Society was intended as a lia
son between fraternity and non-fraternity men.
It fell into inactivity for lack of any real need.
The new Axe Society states in its as yet un
approved constitution that the group will
"sponsoi informal meetings between cam
pus leaders, faculty, and university admin
istration tor the purpose oI bringing about
mutual understanding in regard to any cl
the various projects being undertaken by
the Alumni Association, the Stanford Asso
ciates, the administration, anil student or
ganizations."
Looks pretty all inclusive to us. And all-in
clusive organizations often turn out lo include
close lo nothing.
We would challenge the constitution as too
vague. It furnishes a good example ol an or
ganization starting with nebulous purpose, that
could easily end up doing nothing, or else de
veloping functions that overlap those ol other
organizations.
Primarily, the group is intended to bridge
the gap between alumni and students. While
there is certainly no conflict between these
areas, a closer harmony no doubt is desirable.
But it should be tackled concretely.
While this group would not receive ASSU
funds, its future course looks very likely to
veer in the wiong direction, toward inac
tivity or duplication if the present consti
tution is OKed. We criticize this as sense
less effort if not on the basis of financial
waste.
