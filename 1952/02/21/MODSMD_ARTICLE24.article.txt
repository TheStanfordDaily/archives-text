### PETE GROTHE 
FOR A FETTER STANFORD: FOREIGN
LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS AND
SUMMARY
Time now to bring the crusade to a close, but not
before I throw in u few shots about Stanford's lan
guage requirements.
My principal objections to the language require
ments can be put into the form of three questions:
(1) What per cent of the students taking languages
will use them?
(2) If they do use them, how much is their instruc
tion at Stanford going to help them?
(3) How many more important courses could they
be taking for the same 18 units?
the language department would counter my argu
ments by saying that their primary pur«o«e in teach-

ing language is not so people
tan speak the languages in for
eign countries. Rather it is to
# show students the relationship
between languages and to make
students conscious of the fact
that the way people think in
English is not the only way to
think.
To say that languages do not
play an important part in our col
lege training would be a gross er-

ror. The salient point, however, is that there are
MANY MOKE IMPORTANT COURSES THAT CAN
BE REQUIRED EOR. THE SAME AMOUNT OF
UNITS.
Listen to one of the professors I interviewed ... an
outstanding educator: "Foreign language requirements
for university graduation aresgenerally a hangover
from early days when languages were a definite need.
Today the university graduate, as a rule, has no real
need for a foreign language (if he does, he can prob
ably learn the language easily with the proper in
centive), but he does have need for time to gain
a general education In order to meet moral and spiri
tual needs and understand human lelations iri a dis
illusioned world."
One member of the administration who is "in the
know" estimated that more than 50 per cent of the
faculty were in favor of reducing language require
ments.
In the way of background, languages used to be
vil.il for advanced study. Many gical pieces of liter

ature hadn't been translated into English and had to
he read in their own tongue. Also, to flip oflf several
languages with polished nonchalance was the mark
of a cultured man. Now, however, so many new
fields have been opened and there are so many more
things that we have to learn in the span of four
years that languages have decreased greatly in com
parative importance.
Western Civ is by far the most comprehensive and
broadening course that is required-of Stanford stu
dents. It encompasses history, philosophy, religion,
science, art, and geography. It takes 12 units. The
avowed purpose of the language requirement is, as
we said, to show students the relationship between
languages and to make students conscious of the fact
that the way people think in English is not the only
way to think. It takes 18 units. There seems to be a
discrepancy in the sense of values.
The language department has done a revamping on
its program, to go into effect next year. It is to he con
gratulated on this. Congratulations are also in order
for a lot of good hard work on the part of the Student-
Faculty Education Committee. But if we must keep
language requirements, a further .shift in emphasis is
needed.
More emphasis should be put on conversation( the
language department is giving optional two-unit con
versation courses next year) and above all, new texts
should stress the culture and history of the various
countries, rather than telling glorified fairy tales.
The French department has good literature, but
"Penpaliva" and "La Parsela," required in the Span
ish department, are nothing more than cops and rob
bers mysteries with Spanish accents. In other words,
if a person goes to a Spanish-speaking country, those
two books will do him lit lie good.
* * * *
From now on, I'll cut the crusades and make with
the jokes again. But I thought that it was time that
five areas of controversy be presented to the students
—emphasis on teaching, change in the advising system,
faculty rating sheets, expanded Counseling and Guid
ance Center, and language requirements.
After my talks and interviews, I am confident (hat
the majority of faculty members and students feel
much the same way 1 do. Whether anything will be
done or not is another question. Probably not.
There are just enough status quo-ers around to pre
vent it.

avowed purpose of the language requirement is, as
we said, to show students the relationship between
languages and to make students conscious of the fact
that the way people think in English is not the only
way to think. It takes 18 units. There seems to be a
discrepancy in the sense of values.
The language department has done a revamping on
its program, to go into effect next year. It is to he con

for a lot of good hard work on the part of the Student-

language requirements, a further .shift in emphasis is
needed.
More emphasis should be put on conversation( the
language department is giving optional two-unit con
versation courses next year) and above all, new texts
should stress the culture and history of the various
countries, rather than telling glorified fairy tales.
The French department has good literature, but
"Penpaliva" and "La Parsela," required in the Span

if a person goes to a Spanish-speaking country, those
two books will do him lit lie good.

FOR A FETTER STANFORD: FOREIGN
LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS AND
SUMMARY
Time now to bring the crusade to a close, but not
before I throw in u few shots about Stanford's lan
guage requirements.
My principal objections to the language require
ments can be put into the form of three questions:
(1) What per cent of the students taking languages
will use them?
(2) If they do use them, how much is their instruc
tion at Stanford going to help them?
(3) How many more important courses could they
be taking for the same 18 units?
the language department would counter my argu
ments by saying that their primary pur«o«e in teach-

ing language is not so people
tan speak the languages in for
eign countries. Rather it is to
# show students the relationship
between languages and to make
students conscious of the fact
that the way people think in
English is not the only way to
think.
To say that languages do not
play an important part in our col
lege training would be a gross er-

ror. The salient point, however, is that there are
MANY MOKE IMPORTANT COURSES THAT CAN
BE REQUIRED EOR. THE SAME AMOUNT OF
UNITS.
Listen to one of the professors I interviewed ... an
outstanding educator: "Foreign language requirements
for university graduation aresgenerally a hangover
from early days when languages were a definite need.
Today the university graduate, as a rule, has no real
need for a foreign language (if he does, he can prob
ably learn the language easily with the proper in
centive), but he does have need for time to gain
a general education In order to meet moral and spiri
tual needs and understand human lelations iri a dis
illusioned world."
One member of the administration who is "in the
know" estimated that more than 50 per cent of the
faculty were in favor of reducing language require
ments.
In the way of background, languages used to be
vil.il for advanced study. Many gical pieces of liter

ature hadn't been translated into English and had to
he read in their own tongue. Also, to flip oflf several
languages with polished nonchalance was the mark
of a cultured man. Now, however, so many new
fields have been opened and there are so many more
things that we have to learn in the span of four
years that languages have decreased greatly in com
parative importance.

be taking for the same 18 units?
the language department would counter my argu
ments by saying that their primary pur«o«e in teach-

ing language is not so people
tan speak the languages in for
eign countries. Rather it is to
# show students the relationship
between languages and to make
students conscious of the fact
that the way people think in
English is not the only way to
think.
To say that languages do not
play an important part in our col
lege training would be a gross er-

ror. The salient point, however, is that there are
MANY MOKE IMPORTANT COURSES THAT CAN
BE REQUIRED EOR. THE SAME AMOUNT OF
UNITS.
Listen to one of the professors I interviewed ... an
outstanding educator: "Foreign language requirements
for university graduation aresgenerally a hangover
from early days when languages were a definite need.
Today the university graduate, as a rule, has no real
need for a foreign language (if he does, he can prob
ably learn the language easily with the proper in
centive), but he does have need for time to gain
a general education In order to meet moral and spiri
tual needs and understand human lelations iri a dis
illusioned world."
One member of the administration who is "in the
know" estimated that more than 50 per cent of the
faculty were in favor of reducing language require
ments.
In the way of background, languages used to be
vil.il for advanced study. Many gical pieces of liter

ature hadn't been translated into English and had to
he read in their own tongue. Also, to flip oflf several
languages with polished nonchalance was the mark
of a cultured man. Now, however, so many new
fields have been opened and there are so many more
things that we have to learn in the span of four
years that languages have decreased greatly in com
parative importance.
Western Civ is by far the most comprehensive and
broadening course that is required-of Stanford stu
dents. It encompasses history, philosophy, religion,
science, art, and geography. It takes 12 units. The
avowed purpose of the language requirement is, as
we said, to show students the relationship between
languages and to make students conscious of the fact
that the way people think in English is not the only
way to think. It takes 18 units. There seems to be a
discrepancy in the sense of values.
The language department has done a revamping on
its program, to go into effect next year. It is to he con
gratulated on this. Congratulations are also in order
for a lot of good hard work on the part of the Student-
Faculty Education Committee. But if we must keep
language requirements, a further .shift in emphasis is
needed.
More emphasis should be put on conversation( the
language department is giving optional two-unit con
versation courses next year) and above all, new texts
should stress the culture and history of the various
countries, rather than telling glorified fairy tales.
The French department has good literature, but
"Penpaliva" and "La Parsela," required in the Span
ish department, are nothing more than cops and rob
bers mysteries with Spanish accents. In other words,
if a person goes to a Spanish-speaking country, those
two books will do him lit lie good.

From now on, I'll cut the crusades and make with
the jokes again. But I thought that it was time that
five areas of controversy be presented to the students
—emphasis on teaching, change in the advising system,
faculty rating sheets, expanded Counseling and Guid
ance Center, and language requirements.
After my talks and interviews, I am confident (hat
the majority of faculty members and students feel
much the same way 1 do. Whether anything will be
done or not is another question. Probably not.
There are just enough status quo-ers around to pre
vent it.
