# UMT Approved

### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 â€” The
Senate Armed Services Committee
approved a Universal Military
Training Bill today after ordering
the armed services to cut their man
power to 2,000,000 men as UMT
builds up the reserves.
The committee, which approved
the bill on a 12 to 0 vote, also de
ridded that the first trainees should
be chosen by a lottery rather than
be taken through the draft.
The Senate bill followed in nearly
all other respects a measure ap
proved earlier by the House Armed
Services Committee. Both provide
six months' training for all able
bodied 18 - year - olds, who then
would go into the reserves for 7'/â€¢>
years.
