Despite flu epidemics, two world wars, parking problems, and
black outs, the Tuesday Evening .Series has been one of Stan
lord's favorite events for more than 60 years.
The Series dates back as far as December 8, 1891, when it was
known as the "Tuesday Evening Lectures." Faculty members

were the main participants, but dis- +
tinguished visitors from such col
leges as Dartmouth and Harvard
constituted many of the programs.
Because of limited space and small
audiences, the lecture site was Me
morial Church.
The Series gradually declined
in popularity as student activity |
increased in other fields. 11 ceased
completely from 1 X!>7 to 1 fIUO and
resumed as a school assembly
with local speakers ahout five
years later. 'lliltc were al o eve
ning lectures similar to the Tues
day Series, hut these were held at
varying intervals and had no pos
itive theme.
The Tuesday Lectures were re~ i
vived in 1916 under the title "Tues- |
day Evening Meetings." Besides i
bringing the public and University I
into closer co - ordination, their j
main purpose was to create a va- j
riety of intellectual stimuli for the
students and to contribute to the i
community's cultural interests.
The first Meeting was given by
the Kev. W .L. Sullivan on Sept.
(J. Other meeting programs in- !
eluded the Savannah String
Quartet, "Mining the Frozen (
Gravel of the Arctic" by 11. M.
Payne, and"The St a g in g of
Shakespeare" by actor - director
11. Granville Barker. Former Ah
bassador to Russia Joseph Davies
was another speaker.
In the autumn of 1018 the Series '
had another blow when it was I
temporarily discontinued because oi
a flu epidemic. During its later I
years it was held in the Little The- I
ater and adjourned to the Assembly
Hall or Memorial Church to take I
care of larger audiences.
Such activities as boxing and bas
ketball the Series competition
in 1934, but by 1939 attendance was
big enough to present a definite
parking problem. Several years
later, community questionnaires
praised the weekly program by ap
proving its policy and distribution
of interests. During that same year
University officials condemned the
action of students who plastered pa
trons' car windows with football
stickers.
Blackouts, tire shortages, and
war-time conditions almost halted
the Series in 1942. In spite of these
troubles, audiences totaling 27,098
attended the Series that year, only
slightly le.is than the previous year,
Jumping from an average of 903
persons per week during 1937-12,
the Series attendance often totals
1,719, a capacity crowd. Dozens
of li teners were turned awav last
year at Admiral Nimitz's talk on
"Korea and the UN." Another rec
ord audience heard Dr. Robert
Millikan's lecture "Two Supreme
Forces in Human Progress."
Like all popular events, the Tues
day Series has its list of humorous
incidents. It is rumored that one
night the scheduled .speaker stag
gered down the aisle, collapsed in a
front row seat, and demanded to
know the lecturer's (his own)
whereabouts. After due delibera
tion, the audience concluded that he
was under alcoholic influence.
The Series is planned and oper
ated by a subordinate branch of' the
Public Exercises Committee. This
branch meets once a quarter to map I
out tentative schedules for the com- !
