## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
Stanford's rugged wrestlers came back with a vengeance last
night as they rallied from behind in the last match to tie California,
last year's co-champs and heavy favorites, 16 to 16. In their last
meeting, the Bears overran the Indians 3C to 6.
Though the score was deadlocked, it was actually a moral vie-

Tory for Coach Don Williams'
charges. They had two pins and
two decisions to to Cal's one pin and
two decisions. The remaining five
points came from a forfeit in the
J 23-1 Ij. class.
Oliver Lyon vs. the Bears' Bill
Hart at 130 was probably the best
match of the evening. The "little
tiger" pinned his man twice in the
first two periods, but both were de
clared out of bounds. After the sec
second near pin, Lyon's shoulder,
which had kept him out all season,
was injured, but he wouldn't give
up. He fought aggressively until
the final whistle, gathering a deci
sion.
At 137, George Russell showed
about the best form of his career as
he moved Cal' Bob Rugg all over
the floor, finally pinning him in one
minute 41 seconds of the third pe
riod.
Cal's Julian Sanders at 147 deci
sional Stanford's Dick Owens in a
very close match, and Dick Witt de
cif;ioned the Cards' Ken James at
157. Witt, had James in bad shape
three times, but was unable to pin
him.
Pat Madden, the "fighting rebel,"
c:t/ne through in his usual sensa
tional form to pin Bub Hanke in the
307—1b. class. Madden's aggressive
play had Henke in trouble through- j
out the first period, and the rugged
ire. hman finally pinned his man in
one minute 37 seconds of the sec
ond quarter.
The outstanding individual per
formance of the evening came from
Cal's Bentley Lyon at 177. Lyon,
wrestling against Stanford's Jack
showed the form that car
jie.f him to last year's PCC title
and makes him one of the top con
tenders lor the Olympic Games. He
pinned Ogelsby in three minutes 40
seonds.
Counting five points for a pin,

three for a decision, and five for a
forfeit, Cal led going into the last
match, 1(5-13.
In the heavyweight match, Stan
ford's Rod Garner went against
Cal's Ray Mosten in about the clos
est match of the evening. Each man
had two near pins, but at the end
of four periods Garner finally came
out the winner by a decision to tie
it up. Final score—l 6 to l(i.
