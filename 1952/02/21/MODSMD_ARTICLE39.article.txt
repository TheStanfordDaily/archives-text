# Card Ruggers Face Palo Alto Ramblers
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Stanford's ruggers will be look- j
ing for their first win of the season
Saturday when they face the rugged
Palo Alto Ramblers. The game will
be played on the rugby field (be- '
hind the Sunken Diamond). Start- 1
ing time is 3 p.m., and admission is
free.
Last week the Cards dropped a
tough 3-0 game to the Olympic
Club in the mud and rain. The
Palo Alto Ramblers have likewise
lost to the Clubbers, 4-5.
Bolstered by many former Stan
ford and San Jose State stars, the
Ramblers will provide a rough test.
Aithough their 270 - pound kicker,
Howie Sonnickson, will probably
see limited action because of inju
ries, they will be at lull strength.
Leading the roster of former Card |
and Spartan athletes are Jim |
Whelahan, a 230-pound former San j
Jose State tackle; and George and i
Rich Angus, Spartan heavyweight ;
wrestlers.
Hod Ray, who played football for
Oregon last year, and Jan Lcwen
haupt, a drop - kicking specialist
from Holland, will also help bolster
the backlield. The Ramblers have the
best fullback on the Coast in Vance
ShefTy, an all-time great at Stan
ford. Rock Eldridge, a rugger of 12
years' experience, will help bolster
j the scrum.
The key to the Rambler fortunes
tomorrow could easily lie in wheth-

er Russ Latham decides to play or
not. Rues, who has been kept busy
with studies at the Farm, is uncer
tain whether he can play on Sat
urday. Last year he played for
Stanford and was judged the best
rugger on the Farm since the early
1900's. In 1950, playing for British
Columbia, he made the All-British
Empire team.

ing time is 3 p.m., and admission is
free.
Last week the Cards dropped a
tough 3-0 game to the Olympic
Club in the mud and rain. The
Palo Alto Ramblers have likewise
lost to the Clubbers, 4-5.
Bolstered by many former Stan
ford and San Jose State stars, the
Ramblers will provide a rough test.
Aithough their 270 - pound kicker,
Howie Sonnickson, will probably
see limited action because of inju
ries, they will be at lull strength.
Leading the roster of former Card |
and Spartan athletes are Jim |
Whelahan, a 230-pound former San j
Jose State tackle; and George and i
Rich Angus, Spartan heavyweight ;
wrestlers.
Hod Ray, who played football for
Oregon last year, and Jan Lcwen
haupt, a drop - kicking specialist
from Holland, will also help bolster
the backlield. The Ramblers have the
best fullback on the Coast in Vance
ShefTy, an all-time great at Stan
ford. Rock Eldridge, a rugger of 12
years' experience, will help bolster
j the scrum.
The key to the Rambler fortunes
tomorrow could easily lie in wheth-

er Russ Latham decides to play or
not. Rues, who has been kept busy
with studies at the Farm, is uncer
tain whether he can play on Sat
urday. Last year he played for
Stanford and was judged the best
rugger on the Farm since the early
1900's. In 1950, playing for British
Columbia, he made the All-British
Empire team.
