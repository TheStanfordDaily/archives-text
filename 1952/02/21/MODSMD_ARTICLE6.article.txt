# U.S.C. Invades For Crucials
## Cards Need Pair to Fire Flag Hopes; Bob Burnett to Use Platoon System 
### 
With flag hopes flickering, Stanford's basketbaliers play host
to an intruding USC quintet Friday and Saturday nights in the
Pavilion. Tip-off time of both games is 8, preceded by prelimi
naries. Tickets are now on sale at the BAG.
Coach Bob Burnett's boys, fresh from a 77-68 win over a

firehousc UCLA squad, must win the
two games this week as well as two
next weekend against California,
current division leaders, in order to
stay in shouting distance of the
Southern Division championship.
Burnett concedcs that the invad
ing 'fro'ans are lough, hut opines,
"I think \vc can beat them twice."
In preparation for such doings,
Burnett has devoted the afternoon
practice sessions this week to tim
ing and running. In addition the
two platoon system has hcen
sharpened.
Burnett has said that in order to
win the next four the usual theory
of "play your own game and don't
worry about your opponent" will be
discarded. That is, it will no longer
be a case of Stanford playing its
game and letting the other team play
in its accustomed manner. The In
dians will be after the opponents'
weaknesses on both ofTense and de
fense.
And what is the most apparent
weakness of USC? Most probably
it is lack of quick, agile players.
Only Ken Flower and second
stringer Chuck Kcilly arc the hus
tling, spirited type of ball play
ers. Stanford has Ollic SuzdalclT,
Ron Tomsic, Jim Walsh, and Ed
Tuckcr, all quick and all starters.
This might be the fastest, hustling
est, clcverist, weekend of basket
ball produced by the Stanfords in
a long time.
USC comes to town with a con
ference record of four wins and four
losses. The Indians can only boast
three wins as compared with five
losses.
USC Coach Forrest Twogood
twisted his starting five in the sec
ond game of the Bear series, last
weekend, and the Trojans roared
back to win by 19 after dropping
the Friday tilt. The switch involved
moving Ken Blower from his usual
forward position to guard, and plac
ing Ed Simpson at the forward. It
payed off as the Trojans, with their
new combo, hit 37 per cent of their
shots, an average which will win
most games.
The remainder of the IJSC live
will be the same as that which
faced the Cards when the locals
dropped a twin bill to the SCcrs
down South. Bob Boyd will open
at center and is extremely dan
gerous on hook shots. High scor
ing Bruce Bennett will be work
ing with Simpson at forward while
Dick Hammer will be at the guard
spot opposite Flower.
Stanford's lineup is juggled again.
Juggled to the extent that SuzdalefT
has once again replaced Paul John
son in the starting live. It was
"Suds" who saw early action in the
second game against the Bruins and
