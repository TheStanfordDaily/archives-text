# Film Society To See Movie
## 
### 
BeJa Bartok's "Music for String
Instruments" is the title of an ex
perimental film to be shown to the
Stanford Film Society at 7:30 to
night in Cubberley Auditorium.
Prepared by graduate students
from Stanford and the University of
California, this film is an attempt to
create visually the same impres
sions that the music gives audially,
thus superimposing two art forms:
the film and the music.
Stanford students who prepared
the film are Richard Payne, Bin ton
Wilner, George Woodward, Juliana
Santucci, Jeanne Rego, Donnie
Keogh, Clarice Futrelli, and Robert
Read.
Tonight's program will abo in
clude five other short experimental
pictures.
