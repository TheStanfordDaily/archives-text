# Senate Race to Be Close; Three Seats May Decide
## 
### HADLEY ROFF 
The outcomc of the 1952 Senate race is a tossup willi the election
shaping as one of the closest in U.S. history.
for the first time since 1894 the party electing a president might
not control the Senate as the power balance, for Senators could
tip either way in this year's balloting. So far politicians of both

parties refuse to predict an outcome
as they admit the election is any
body's guess.
Willi the present Senate lined
lip 50 hi HI for the Democrats, the
GOI* needs hut three additional
seats to assume (he master role.
But tu gain (hose seats would mean
that Republicans would have to
win more seats than they did in
(lie landslide of 1!)4(>.
Willi 20 Republican and 14 Demo
cratic seats being contested this year
it seems arithmetically doubtful
whether Republicans can capture
Senate control this year. But such
a victory is possible, and anxious j
Democrats openly admit so.
With Senate control liable to fall
either to Republicans or Democrats,
leaders of both parties are working
hard to give candidates as much sup
port. as possible. But so far such
party help has been weak as both
Republicans and Democrats fish for
a presidential standard bearer.
To win command in the Senate
(lie Republicans must not only re
claim their 20 contes(ed seats but
also grab 3 from Democrats. To do
(hat GOP strategists are searching
for Democratic weak spots, and
they believe such spots exist in
Maryland, Michigan, and Con
necticut.
In Maryland, where incumbent
Herbert R. O'Connor has stepped
down, the GOP hopes to scat popu
lar live term Congressman J. Glenn
Beall. Democrat Blair Moody, who
was appointed to (ill the Michigan
Senate post loft vacant at the death
of GOP giant Arthur Vandenberg,
faces stifT competition as Vanden
berg's son, Arthur Jr., takes the
stump.
Connecticut's Democratic Senator
William Benton, long the object of
Senator Joe McCarthy's branding
tongue, faces Republican Prescott
Bush. In 1950 Benton bested Bush j
by a mere 1,102 votes for the Senate
post giving fodder to GOP hopes.
The Democrats, too, arc prob
ing for weakness and arc focus
ing attention on Nevada, where
hnig-windcd Renublicnn Senator
George Mahine is slumping for
re-clec(ion. Malonc, who spoke
more words on (he Senate floor
(ban any other member lasl year,
is on (he outs according to most
observers.
Another Republican with trem
bling support is arch-conservative
Jamc.; Kem, who is campaigning for
re-election in President Truman's
home state of Missouri. Disliked hy
many liberal Republicans, Kern's
support is waning.
The other seats among the 34 be
ing contested are considered safe.
Of the II Democratic seats, live are
from the South and arc untouch
able.
Out poken Senators such as Wil
liam F. Knowland of California and
Wisconsin's Joe McCarthy also
should have little trouble in re
claiming their Senate seats.
Though McCarthy is the sub
ject of much nationwide com
plain!, his re-election seems cer
tain now (hat he's embraced by

Senator Robert A. Taft.
Thus, as things now stand the
election can result:
1. In a Republican victory if the
GOP can pick up three seats and
hold Nevada and Missouri.
2. In the Democrats holding their
lead.
3. Or in the Republicans gaining
only two scats which would tangle
the Senate in a tie.
These are the possibilities that
today have politicians and voters
alike scratching their heads and
mumbling, "I wonder."


VERBAL CLASH ON TV—Sen. Robert A. Taft (lelt), Republican Presidential aspirant, accuses
Tex McCrary, an Eisenhower campaigner (right), of calling him a liar on "The Author Meets the
Critics," a Now York television show. McCrary had remarked that Taft was careless with the
truth in his book which v/as under discussion. The audience, mostly Taft supporters, became so
noisy that moderator Fay Emerson pleaded with the two men to change the subject.
