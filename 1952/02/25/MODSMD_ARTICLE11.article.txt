# Long Stalls Highlight Double Win for Cards
## Hoopsters Climb From PCC Cellar 
### LARRY CAHN 
Stanford's racehorse cagers
got off fast, slowed at the turns,
and roared home to win two "un
usual" weekend games from an
aggressive USC five.
In trouncing the Trojans 51-41
Friday night and again 73-G5 Sat
urday evening, the Indians climbed
out of the cellar and remained
a definite title contender in the
Southern Division PCC race. The
Cards must whip the Bears twice
next weekend and UCLA must lose
one for Stanford to gain a playoff
with the Bruin 3, who this weekend
took over the Conference lead by
trouncing the Bears twice.
Coach Bob Burnett's strategy of
playing to the opponents' weaknes:;
paid ofF both nights. The lack of
quick, agile ballplayers on the SC
squad, with the exception of Ken
Flower and Chuck Reilly, enabled
Stanford to build up an early lead
and then play cat and mouse with
the Trojans.
Cards Take Lead
In Friday's contest the Cards,
paced by Ed Tucker, Jim Ramsrtead,
and Jim Walsh, caught fire and
zoomed into a 26-12 first-quarter
advantage over the visitors, who
could only hit one in their first 15
attempts from the floor.
It was then that Burnett, in order
to take advantage of Trojan slow
ness and to protect his squad from
unnecessary roughness under the
boards, ordered his troops into a
stall. And what a stall it was.
Deep Freeze Begins
01 ie Suzdaleff started it when he
froze with the ball just over the
center line. The Trojans, under
Coach Forrest Twogood's instruc
tiona, refused to come out for the
ball, and Olie wouldn't move. Two
good left the Pavilion for a short
smoke. The players relaxed in their
positions, the Stanford band struck
up "The Cardinal Is Waving," and
the 2,800 packed into the Paviiicn
voiced their approval.
Three and a half minutes later
Twogood returned to the bench and
motioned his team to go get the
ball. Then the rough stuff started.
The Stanford staii allowed the
Trojans only five points in the sec
ond period while the Injuns were
netting only four. The half-time
score was Stanford 30, USC 17.
Following the intermission Stan
ford started all over again, but thn
time the Trojans were after the ball
and they didn't care how they got
it. The SCers committed 39 fouls in
the course of the game. Stanford in
the second half turned down 20 foul
shots from the floor in order to take
the ball out of bounds and
possession.
Fourth-Period Rally
In the fourth period, the intrud
ers did start to close as substitutes
Leroy Kasperski and Jerry Kinche
loe pulled Troy to within eight dig
its of the Cards, 34-42. Wot liking
this a bit, Stanford racked up three
straight buckets in 15 scconds aj
Ramstead hit two and Tomsic one
on plays that were initiated out of
bounds. With each bucket the
shooter was fouled, refused the free
throw, and started the whole thing
over with the ball out of bounds.
Saturday it was more of the same
but only after the Cards had over
come a 21-20 Troy lead. SC was a
lot sharper in the opening minutes;
and with Ed Simpson and Bob Boy 1
! hitting, led at one time by six.
But it was then that Tucker pi't
i on one of the finest shooting exbi
! bitions seen in the Pavilion. Smooth
j Ed hit for six straight baskets to
I give the Indians a lead which stuck
I and permitted Stanford to use the
stall.
Tucker first scored from 25 feet,
j out, then on a fast break leap shot

ford's second team held USC on even terms both nights.
