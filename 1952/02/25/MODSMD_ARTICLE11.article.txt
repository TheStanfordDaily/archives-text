# Long Stalls Highlight Double Win for Cards
## Hoopsters Climb From PCC Cellar 
### LARRY CAHN 
Stanford's racehorse cagers
got off fast, slowed at the turns,
and roared home to win two "un
usual" weekend games from an
aggressive USC five.
In trouncing the Trojans 51-41
Friday night and again 73-G5 Sat
urday evening, the Indians climbed
out of the cellar and remained
a definite title contender in the
Southern Division PCC race. The
Cards must whip the Bears twice
next weekend and UCLA must lose
one for Stanford to gain a playoff
with the Bruin 3, who this weekend
took over the Conference lead by
trouncing the Bears twice.
Coach Bob Burnett's strategy of
playing to the opponents' weaknes:;
paid ofF both nights. The lack of
quick, agile ballplayers on the SC
squad, with the exception of Ken
Flower and Chuck Reilly, enabled
Stanford to build up an early lead
and then play cat and mouse with
the Trojans.
Cards Take Lead
In Friday's contest the Cards,
paced by Ed Tucker, Jim Ramsrtead,
and Jim Walsh, caught fire and
zoomed into a 26-12 first-quarter
advantage over the visitors, who
could only hit one in their first 15
attempts from the floor.
It was then that Burnett, in order
to take advantage of Trojan slow
ness and to protect his squad from
unnecessary roughness under the
boards, ordered his troops into a
stall. And what a stall it was.
Deep Freeze Begins
01 ie Suzdaleff started it when he
froze with the ball just over the
center line. The Trojans, under
Coach Forrest Twogood's instruc
tiona, refused to come out for the
ball, and Olie wouldn't move. Two
good left the Pavilion for a short
smoke. The players relaxed in their
positions, the Stanford band struck
up "The Cardinal Is Waving," and
the 2,800 packed into the Paviiicn
voiced their approval.
Three and a half minutes later
Twogood returned to the bench and
motioned his team to go get the
ball. Then the rough stuff started.
The Stanford staii allowed the
Trojans only five points in the sec
ond period while the Injuns were
netting only four. The half-time
score was Stanford 30, USC 17.
Following the intermission Stan
ford started all over again, but thn
time the Trojans were after the ball
and they didn't care how they got
it. The SCers committed 39 fouls in
the course of the game. Stanford in
the second half turned down 20 foul
shots from the floor in order to take
the ball out of bounds and
possession.
Fourth-Period Rally
In the fourth period, the intrud
ers did start to close as substitutes
Leroy Kasperski and Jerry Kinche
loe pulled Troy to within eight dig
its of the Cards, 34-42. Wot liking
this a bit, Stanford racked up three
straight buckets in 15 scconds aj
Ramstead hit two and Tomsic one
on plays that were initiated out of
bounds. With each bucket the
shooter was fouled, refused the free
throw, and started the whole thing
over with the ball out of bounds.
Saturday it was more of the same
but only after the Cards had over
come a 21-20 Troy lead. SC was a
lot sharper in the opening minutes;
and with Ed Simpson and Bob Boy 1
! hitting, led at one time by six.
But it was then that Tucker pi't
i on one of the finest shooting exbi
! bitions seen in the Pavilion. Smooth
j Ed hit for six straight baskets to
I give the Indians a lead which stuck
I and permitted Stanford to use the
stall.
Tucker first scored from 25 feet,
j out, then on a fast break leap shot


TV/IN KILLING—When Stanford's first team tires, the second
platoon takes over. Here Lanky Dave Epperson passes off over
USC's giant pivotman Bob Boyd. George Zaninovich and Trojan
Chuck Reilly watch the proceedings in the background. Stan
ford's second team held USC on even terms both nights.

from 30 feet out, followed by a lay
in; then it was a tip-in, a corner
shot, and a drive-in, all in quick
succession. Ed netted 21 in the first
half but only shot twice in the
second - half delaying tactics, to
wind up the evening with 24. Bob
Boyd, SC center, copped scoring
honors with 2G.
The fine play and shooting of
Walsh and Tomsic, coupled with
Tucker's spurt, gave the Injuns a
43-35 intermission lead which was
only threatened briefiy in the
fourth stanza when the Trojans
"butchered" the lead io six points.
Troy committed "only" 31 fouls
Saturday night and lost three men
via the foul route —Dick Hammer,
Ken Flower, and Chuck Reilly.
Strong boy Bob Morton commit
ted what looked to be unnecessary
fouls both Friday and Saturday,
and the crowd let him know it.
A great amount of credit for the
twin wins goes to Stanford's second
team of George Zaninovioh, Bruct
Iverson, Dave Epperson, Don De
long, and Tom DuFour. So perfect
was their hustling zone defense
when they relieved the starting five
that the Trojans had difficulty in
getting shots away. And the few
times Troy did score the supposed
defensive unit scored right back.
In the two nights of ball open
hostilities broke out twice. Alter

Fi iday'.s game Bob Burnett stepped
between Twogood and Connie Jar
vis to halt contact when the Stan
ford trainer made a remark which
rubbed the Troy mentor the wrong
way. And Saturday Ramstead was
restrained by Boyd from taking a
poke at Ed Simpson following over
eagerness under the SC basket.
So Stanford is once more in
shouting distance of the title. The
Indians must keep winning, and
those "awful" Trojans mu :t win at
iea;t one from the Bruin.'.; this com
ing weekend.

Tucker's spurt, gave the Injuns a
43-35 intermission lead which was
only threatened briefiy in the
fourth stanza when the Trojans
"butchered" the lead io six points.
Troy committed "only" 31 fouls
Saturday night and lost three men
via the foul route —Dick Hammer,
Ken Flower, and Chuck Reilly.
Strong boy Bob Morton commit
ted what looked to be unnecessary
fouls both Friday and Saturday,
and the crowd let him know it.
A great amount of credit for the
twin wins goes to Stanford's second
team of George Zaninovioh, Bruct
Iverson, Dave Epperson, Don De
long, and Tom DuFour. So perfect
was their hustling zone defense
when they relieved the starting five
that the Trojans had difficulty in
getting shots away. And the few
times Troy did score the supposed
defensive unit scored right back.
In the two nights of ball open
hostilities broke out twice. Alter

Fi iday'.s game Bob Burnett stepped
between Twogood and Connie Jar
vis to halt contact when the Stan
ford trainer made a remark which
rubbed the Troy mentor the wrong
way. And Saturday Ramstead was
restrained by Boyd from taking a
poke at Ed Simpson following over
eagerness under the SC basket.
So Stanford is once more in
shouting distance of the title. The
Indians must keep winning, and
those "awful" Trojans mu :t win at
iea;t one from the Bruin.'.; this com
ing weekend.

Stanford's racehorse cagers
got off fast, slowed at the turns,
and roared home to win two "un
usual" weekend games from an
aggressive USC five.
In trouncing the Trojans 51-41
Friday night and again 73-G5 Sat
urday evening, the Indians climbed
out of the cellar and remained
a definite title contender in the
Southern Division PCC race. The
Cards must whip the Bears twice
next weekend and UCLA must lose
one for Stanford to gain a playoff
with the Bruin 3, who this weekend
took over the Conference lead by
trouncing the Bears twice.
Coach Bob Burnett's strategy of
playing to the opponents' weaknes:;
paid ofF both nights. The lack of
quick, agile ballplayers on the SC
squad, with the exception of Ken
Flower and Chuck Reilly, enabled
Stanford to build up an early lead
and then play cat and mouse with
the Trojans.
Cards Take Lead
In Friday's contest the Cards,
paced by Ed Tucker, Jim Ramsrtead,
and Jim Walsh, caught fire and
zoomed into a 26-12 first-quarter
advantage over the visitors, who
could only hit one in their first 15
attempts from the floor.
It was then that Burnett, in order
to take advantage of Trojan slow
ness and to protect his squad from
unnecessary roughness under the
boards, ordered his troops into a
stall. And what a stall it was.
Deep Freeze Begins
01 ie Suzdaleff started it when he
froze with the ball just over the
center line. The Trojans, under
Coach Forrest Twogood's instruc
tiona, refused to come out for the
ball, and Olie wouldn't move. Two
good left the Pavilion for a short
smoke. The players relaxed in their
positions, the Stanford band struck
up "The Cardinal Is Waving," and
the 2,800 packed into the Paviiicn
voiced their approval.
Three and a half minutes later
Twogood returned to the bench and
motioned his team to go get the
ball. Then the rough stuff started.
The Stanford staii allowed the
Trojans only five points in the sec
ond period while the Injuns were
netting only four. The half-time
score was Stanford 30, USC 17.
Following the intermission Stan
ford started all over again, but thn
time the Trojans were after the ball
and they didn't care how they got
it. The SCers committed 39 fouls in
the course of the game. Stanford in
the second half turned down 20 foul
shots from the floor in order to take
the ball out of bounds and
possession.
Fourth-Period Rally
In the fourth period, the intrud
ers did start to close as substitutes
Leroy Kasperski and Jerry Kinche
loe pulled Troy to within eight dig
its of the Cards, 34-42. Wot liking
this a bit, Stanford racked up three
straight buckets in 15 scconds aj
Ramstead hit two and Tomsic one
on plays that were initiated out of
bounds. With each bucket the
shooter was fouled, refused the free
throw, and started the whole thing
over with the ball out of bounds.
Saturday it was more of the same
but only after the Cards had over
come a 21-20 Troy lead. SC was a
lot sharper in the opening minutes;
and with Ed Simpson and Bob Boy 1
! hitting, led at one time by six.
But it was then that Tucker pi't
i on one of the finest shooting exbi
! bitions seen in the Pavilion. Smooth
j Ed hit for six straight baskets to
I give the Indians a lead which stuck
I and permitted Stanford to use the
stall.
Tucker first scored from 25 feet,
j out, then on a fast break leap shot


TV/IN KILLING—When Stanford's first team tires, the second
platoon takes over. Here Lanky Dave Epperson passes off over
USC's giant pivotman Bob Boyd. George Zaninovich and Trojan
Chuck Reilly watch the proceedings in the background. Stan
ford's second team held USC on even terms both nights.
—Daily photo by Frosty North
from 30 feet out, followed by a lay
in; then it was a tip-in, a corner
shot, and a drive-in, all in quick
succession. Ed netted 21 in the first
half but only shot twice in the
second - half delaying tactics, to
wind up the evening with 24. Bob
Boyd, SC center, copped scoring
honors with 2G.
The fine play and shooting of
Walsh and Tomsic, coupled with
Tucker's spurt, gave the Injuns a
43-35 intermission lead which was
only threatened briefiy in the

In trouncing the Trojans 51-41
Friday night and again 73-G5 Sat
urday evening, the Indians climbed
out of the cellar and remained
a definite title contender in the
Southern Division PCC race. The
Cards must whip the Bears twice
next weekend and UCLA must lose
one for Stanford to gain a playoff
with the Bruin 3, who this weekend
took over the Conference lead by
trouncing the Bears twice.
Coach Bob Burnett's strategy of
playing to the opponents' weaknes:;
paid ofF both nights. The lack of
quick, agile ballplayers on the SC
squad, with the exception of Ken
Flower and Chuck Reilly, enabled
Stanford to build up an early lead
and then play cat and mouse with
the Trojans.
Cards Take Lead
In Friday's contest the Cards,
paced by Ed Tucker, Jim Ramsrtead,
and Jim Walsh, caught fire and
zoomed into a 26-12 first-quarter
advantage over the visitors, who
could only hit one in their first 15
attempts from the floor.
It was then that Burnett, in order
to take advantage of Trojan slow
ness and to protect his squad from
unnecessary roughness under the
boards, ordered his troops into a
stall. And what a stall it was.
Deep Freeze Begins
01 ie Suzdaleff started it when he
froze with the ball just over the
center line. The Trojans, under
Coach Forrest Twogood's instruc
tiona, refused to come out for the
ball, and Olie wouldn't move. Two
good left the Pavilion for a short
smoke. The players relaxed in their
positions, the Stanford band struck
up "The Cardinal Is Waving," and
the 2,800 packed into the Paviiicn
voiced their approval.
Three and a half minutes later
Twogood returned to the bench and
motioned his team to go get the
ball. Then the rough stuff started.
The Stanford staii allowed the
Trojans only five points in the sec
ond period while the Injuns were
netting only four. The half-time
score was Stanford 30, USC 17.
Following the intermission Stan
ford started all over again, but thn
time the Trojans were after the ball
and they didn't care how they got
it. The SCers committed 39 fouls in
the course of the game. Stanford in
the second half turned down 20 foul
shots from the floor in order to take
the ball out of bounds and
possession.
Fourth-Period Rally
In the fourth period, the intrud
ers did start to close as substitutes
Leroy Kasperski and Jerry Kinche
loe pulled Troy to within eight dig
its of the Cards, 34-42. Wot liking
this a bit, Stanford racked up three
straight buckets in 15 scconds aj
Ramstead hit two and Tomsic one
on plays that were initiated out of
bounds. With each bucket the
shooter was fouled, refused the free
throw, and started the whole thing
over with the ball out of bounds.
Saturday it was more of the same
but only after the Cards had over
come a 21-20 Troy lead. SC was a
lot sharper in the opening minutes;
and with Ed Simpson and Bob Boy 1
! hitting, led at one time by six.
But it was then that Tucker pi't
i on one of the finest shooting exbi
! bitions seen in the Pavilion. Smooth
j Ed hit for six straight baskets to
I give the Indians a lead which stuck
I and permitted Stanford to use the
stall.
Tucker first scored from 25 feet,
j out, then on a fast break leap shot


TV/IN KILLING—When Stanford's first team tires, the second
platoon takes over. Here Lanky Dave Epperson passes off over
USC's giant pivotman Bob Boyd. George Zaninovich and Trojan
Chuck Reilly watch the proceedings in the background. Stan
ford's second team held USC on even terms both nights.
—Daily photo by Frosty North
from 30 feet out, followed by a lay
in; then it was a tip-in, a corner
shot, and a drive-in, all in quick
succession. Ed netted 21 in the first
half but only shot twice in the
second - half delaying tactics, to
wind up the evening with 24. Bob
Boyd, SC center, copped scoring
honors with 2G.
The fine play and shooting of
Walsh and Tomsic, coupled with
Tucker's spurt, gave the Injuns a
43-35 intermission lead which was
only threatened briefiy in the
fourth stanza when the Trojans
"butchered" the lead io six points.
Troy committed "only" 31 fouls
Saturday night and lost three men
via the foul route —Dick Hammer,
Ken Flower, and Chuck Reilly.
Strong boy Bob Morton commit
ted what looked to be unnecessary
fouls both Friday and Saturday,
and the crowd let him know it.
A great amount of credit for the
twin wins goes to Stanford's second
team of George Zaninovioh, Bruct
Iverson, Dave Epperson, Don De
long, and Tom DuFour. So perfect
was their hustling zone defense
when they relieved the starting five
that the Trojans had difficulty in
getting shots away. And the few
times Troy did score the supposed
defensive unit scored right back.
In the two nights of ball open
hostilities broke out twice. Alter

Fi iday'.s game Bob Burnett stepped
between Twogood and Connie Jar
vis to halt contact when the Stan
ford trainer made a remark which
rubbed the Troy mentor the wrong
way. And Saturday Ramstead was
restrained by Boyd from taking a
poke at Ed Simpson following over
eagerness under the SC basket.
So Stanford is once more in
shouting distance of the title. The
Indians must keep winning, and
those "awful" Trojans mu :t win at
iea;t one from the Bruin.'.; this com
ing weekend.

Saturday night and lost three men
via the foul route —Dick Hammer,
Ken Flower, and Chuck Reilly.
Strong boy Bob Morton commit
ted what looked to be unnecessary
fouls both Friday and Saturday,
and the crowd let him know it.
A great amount of credit for the
twin wins goes to Stanford's second
team of George Zaninovioh, Bruct
Iverson, Dave Epperson, Don De
long, and Tom DuFour. So perfect
was their hustling zone defense
when they relieved the starting five
that the Trojans had difficulty in
getting shots away. And the few
times Troy did score the supposed
defensive unit scored right back.
In the two nights of ball open
hostilities broke out twice. Alter

Fi iday'.s game Bob Burnett stepped
between Twogood and Connie Jar
vis to halt contact when the Stan
ford trainer made a remark which
rubbed the Troy mentor the wrong
way. And Saturday Ramstead was
restrained by Boyd from taking a
poke at Ed Simpson following over
eagerness under the SC basket.
So Stanford is once more in
shouting distance of the title. The
Indians must keep winning, and
those "awful" Trojans mu :t win at
iea;t one from the Bruin.'.; this com
ing weekend.

Stanford's racehorse cagers
got off fast, slowed at the turns,
and roared home to win two "un
usual" weekend games from an
aggressive USC five.
In trouncing the Trojans 51-41
Friday night and again 73-G5 Sat
urday evening, the Indians climbed
out of the cellar and remained
a definite title contender in the
Southern Division PCC race. The
Cards must whip the Bears twice
next weekend and UCLA must lose
one for Stanford to gain a playoff
with the Bruin 3, who this weekend
took over the Conference lead by
trouncing the Bears twice.
Coach Bob Burnett's strategy of
playing to the opponents' weaknes:;
paid ofF both nights. The lack of
quick, agile ballplayers on the SC
squad, with the exception of Ken
Flower and Chuck Reilly, enabled
Stanford to build up an early lead
and then play cat and mouse with
the Trojans.
Cards Take Lead
In Friday's contest the Cards,
paced by Ed Tucker, Jim Ramsrtead,
and Jim Walsh, caught fire and
zoomed into a 26-12 first-quarter
advantage over the visitors, who
could only hit one in their first 15
attempts from the floor.
It was then that Burnett, in order
to take advantage of Trojan slow
ness and to protect his squad from
unnecessary roughness under the
boards, ordered his troops into a
stall. And what a stall it was.
Deep Freeze Begins
01 ie Suzdaleff started it when he
froze with the ball just over the
center line. The Trojans, under
Coach Forrest Twogood's instruc
tiona, refused to come out for the
ball, and Olie wouldn't move. Two
good left the Pavilion for a short
smoke. The players relaxed in their
positions, the Stanford band struck
up "The Cardinal Is Waving," and
the 2,800 packed into the Paviiicn
voiced their approval.
Three and a half minutes later
Twogood returned to the bench and
motioned his team to go get the
ball. Then the rough stuff started.
The Stanford staii allowed the
Trojans only five points in the sec
ond period while the Injuns were
netting only four. The half-time
score was Stanford 30, USC 17.
Following the intermission Stan
ford started all over again, but thn
time the Trojans were after the ball
and they didn't care how they got
it. The SCers committed 39 fouls in
the course of the game. Stanford in
the second half turned down 20 foul
shots from the floor in order to take
the ball out of bounds and
possession.
Fourth-Period Rally
In the fourth period, the intrud
ers did start to close as substitutes
Leroy Kasperski and Jerry Kinche
loe pulled Troy to within eight dig
its of the Cards, 34-42. Wot liking
this a bit, Stanford racked up three
straight buckets in 15 scconds aj
Ramstead hit two and Tomsic one
on plays that were initiated out of
bounds. With each bucket the
shooter was fouled, refused the free
throw, and started the whole thing
over with the ball out of bounds.
Saturday it was more of the same
but only after the Cards had over
come a 21-20 Troy lead. SC was a
lot sharper in the opening minutes;
and with Ed Simpson and Bob Boy 1
! hitting, led at one time by six.
But it was then that Tucker pi't
i on one of the finest shooting exbi
! bitions seen in the Pavilion. Smooth
j Ed hit for six straight baskets to
I give the Indians a lead which stuck
I and permitted Stanford to use the
stall.
Tucker first scored from 25 feet,
j out, then on a fast break leap shot


TV/IN KILLING—When Stanford's first team tires, the second
platoon takes over. Here Lanky Dave Epperson passes off over
USC's giant pivotman Bob Boyd. George Zaninovich and Trojan
Chuck Reilly watch the proceedings in the background. Stan
ford's second team held USC on even terms both nights.

from 30 feet out, followed by a lay
in; then it was a tip-in, a corner
shot, and a drive-in, all in quick
succession. Ed netted 21 in the first
half but only shot twice in the
second - half delaying tactics, to
wind up the evening with 24. Bob
Boyd, SC center, copped scoring
honors with 2G.
The fine play and shooting of
Walsh and Tomsic, coupled with
Tucker's spurt, gave the Injuns a
43-35 intermission lead which was
only threatened briefiy in the
fourth stanza when the Trojans
"butchered" the lead io six points.

shot, and a drive-in, all in quick
succession. Ed netted 21 in the first
half but only shot twice in the
second - half delaying tactics, to
wind up the evening with 24. Bob
Boyd, SC center, copped scoring
honors with 2G.
The fine play and shooting of

Stanford's racehorse cagers
got off fast, slowed at the turns,
and roared home to win two "un
usual" weekend games from an
aggressive USC five.
In trouncing the Trojans 51-41
Friday night and again 73-G5 Sat
urday evening, the Indians climbed
out of the cellar and remained
a definite title contender in the
Southern Division PCC race. The
Cards must whip the Bears twice
next weekend and UCLA must lose
one for Stanford to gain a playoff
with the Bruin 3, who this weekend
took over the Conference lead by
trouncing the Bears twice.
Coach Bob Burnett's strategy of
playing to the opponents' weaknes:;
paid ofF both nights. The lack of
quick, agile ballplayers on the SC
squad, with the exception of Ken
Flower and Chuck Reilly, enabled
Stanford to build up an early lead
and then play cat and mouse with
the Trojans.
Cards Take Lead
In Friday's contest the Cards,
paced by Ed Tucker, Jim Ramsrtead,
and Jim Walsh, caught fire and
zoomed into a 26-12 first-quarter
advantage over the visitors, who
could only hit one in their first 15
attempts from the floor.
It was then that Burnett, in order
to take advantage of Trojan slow
ness and to protect his squad from
unnecessary roughness under the
boards, ordered his troops into a
stall. And what a stall it was.
Deep Freeze Begins
01 ie Suzdaleff started it when he
froze with the ball just over the
center line. The Trojans, under
Coach Forrest Twogood's instruc
tiona, refused to come out for the
ball, and Olie wouldn't move. Two
good left the Pavilion for a short
smoke. The players relaxed in their
positions, the Stanford band struck
up "The Cardinal Is Waving," and
the 2,800 packed into the Paviiicn
voiced their approval.
Three and a half minutes later
Twogood returned to the bench and
motioned his team to go get the
ball. Then the rough stuff started.
The Stanford staii allowed the
Trojans only five points in the sec
ond period while the Injuns were
netting only four. The half-time
score was Stanford 30, USC 17.
Following the intermission Stan
ford started all over again, but thn
time the Trojans were after the ball
and they didn't care how they got
it. The SCers committed 39 fouls in
the course of the game. Stanford in
the second half turned down 20 foul
shots from the floor in order to take
the ball out of bounds and
possession.
Fourth-Period Rally
In the fourth period, the intrud
ers did start to close as substitutes
Leroy Kasperski and Jerry Kinche
loe pulled Troy to within eight dig
its of the Cards, 34-42. Wot liking
this a bit, Stanford racked up three
straight buckets in 15 scconds aj
Ramstead hit two and Tomsic one
on plays that were initiated out of
bounds. With each bucket the
shooter was fouled, refused the free
throw, and started the whole thing
over with the ball out of bounds.
Saturday it was more of the same
but only after the Cards had over
come a 21-20 Troy lead. SC was a
lot sharper in the opening minutes;
and with Ed Simpson and Bob Boy 1
! hitting, led at one time by six.
But it was then that Tucker pi't
i on one of the finest shooting exbi
! bitions seen in the Pavilion. Smooth
j Ed hit for six straight baskets to
I give the Indians a lead which stuck
I and permitted Stanford to use the
stall.
Tucker first scored from 25 feet,
j out, then on a fast break leap shot


TV/IN KILLING—When Stanford's first team tires, the second
platoon takes over. Here Lanky Dave Epperson passes off over
USC's giant pivotman Bob Boyd. George Zaninovich and Trojan
Chuck Reilly watch the proceedings in the background. Stan
ford's second team held USC on even terms both nights.
