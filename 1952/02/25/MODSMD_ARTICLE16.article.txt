Today's concert-goer, accustomed
to the precise sounds of the world's
great symphony orchestras, is apt
to dismiss a student orchestra per
formance from serious considera
tion.
Yet last night's concert by the
Stanford Symphony Orchestra
showed that musical intelligence,

love of music in a student, orchestra
can be tar more exciting than tech

Most, imposing on tlie program
was Beethoven's Leonore Overture
No. 3. In this the orchestra played
with competence befitting profes
sionals, but with a spirit which is
