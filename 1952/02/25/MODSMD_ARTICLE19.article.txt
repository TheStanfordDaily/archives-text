We wore- happy to hear Dean of Students
Donald Winbigler tell us there is no discrimi
nation at Stanford when it comes to admissions.
Stanford has no quota, the Dean said, as to race,
religion, color, creed, or geography.
Still we can't help but wonder why there
aren't more Negroes here. Certainly there are
answers. The tact that there are few Negroes
here to bpgin with, and that members of the
luce often prefer to go where they are not a
distinct minority is one. Stanford's sky high
tuition is another.
But whether we like it or not, many outsiders
have the impression that Stanford discriminates
against Negroes. Winbigler told of one Negro
who came here on a dare. He transferred lo
Stanford when he was told at another univer
sity that Stanford "doesn't accept Negroes."
If outside thinking on the question is false,
it seems to us it could be largely dispelled if
one of the causes of the misconception were
eliminated: the picture required of all appli
cants for admission.
We see no logical purpose for the photo. All
new students are shot on reg day for identifica
tion purposes. Certainly the argument that the
Admissions Office "sizes up prospects" by the
photo holds no scientific water.
Eliminating the picture requirement might be
a good step toward clearing up the miscon
ception— if it is a misconception.

Congratulations to Viewpoint Magazine,
which is past the first and biggest hurdle—its
first issue. Copies sold like the proverbial hot
cakes on campus, and plans now call for branch
ing off campus to Palo Aito and even San Fran
cisco.
Advertising should be easier to pick up now
with the first issue's sales record as a talking

point. And ads will be all "gravy." Viewpoint
shows a prolit 011 sales of the magazine alone,
advertising aside.
Plans for the next issue call for a lead article
by Albert Einstein. Not bad for a shoestring
publication, conceived arnid doubt and wel
comed skeptically. It is this sort of article that
rould make Viewpoint a permanent fixture.
Speaking of magazines, congratulations are
also in order for an older publication—older
and this year apparently wiser—the Chaparral.
The magazine this year is one you don't have
to think twice about before sending it home.
It proves to us that you can definitely "be funny
without being dirty."
Unfortunately, it may also be proving that
you have to be dirty to sell.
At least that's one explanation for the mag
azine's subnormal sales this year. The Chappie
doubts if it is a valid explanation, and we hope
they're right.

Gripe of the week: The poor lighting upstairs
in the Main Library.
If we've heard it once, we've heard it ten
times that "there is nothing at Stanford money
wouldn't cure." Every time we question Busi
ness Manager Alf Brandin or the administration
we get the same answer: "We'd like to fix
that, or build this, or make those much needed
improvements, but we can't handle it finan
cially."
We don't doubt both statements are valid.
But after faculty salary raises (which we don't
quarrel with in the least) and after some more
of those top priorities are out of the way, it
might be a good investment to look into better
lights for the library.
Right now, they're pretty poor.
