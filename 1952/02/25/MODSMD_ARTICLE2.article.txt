# Typhoid Shots Will Be Given
## 
### 
Voluntary free lockjaw and ty
phoid shots will be given tomorrow
from 1 to 4 p.m. at the Stanford
Health Service.
"This service, which would ordi
narily cost $15, provides an excel
lent opportunity for people going
abroad this summer to secure ac
tive immunity against these dis
eases," said Dr. George C. Houck,
director of the Stanford Health
Service.
The shots will continue to be
given every Tuesday and Thursday
until the end of spring quarter.
Both the typhoid and tetanus se
ries consist of three shots. The ty
phoid injections are given once a
week and the tetanus at intervals
of three weeks.
"Typhoid shots have been suc
cessfully used since World War I,
when they were perfected for the
Army. Typhoid fever is the result
of taking poor food or water. While
chances of doing this are small in
regular life, it is always a danger
when any kind of disaster happens
to upset the water or food supply,"
explained Dr. Houck.
"Tetanus or lockjaw is a poten
tial danger whenever the skin has
been broken. The chances arc
slightly higher of being infected
here due to the fact that Stanford
was formerly a horse farm, where
tetanus spores would be more nu
merous. Tetanus immunization was
started in the middle '30s and was
used by the armed forces in World
War II with complete success," ex
plained Dr. Houck.
Typhoid boosters are recom
mended by the Health Service three
years after immunization. In addi
tion the Health Service advised that
students should have a lockjaw
booster one year after completion
of a series. This will give them ac
tive immunity for the rest of their
life.
Active immunity for typhoid oc
curs a few weeks after the series
is completed, and tetanus immu
nity five to six months after the
three shots. Dr. Houck encourages
students to start the series as soon
as possible in order to bo immune
to tetanus by summer.
