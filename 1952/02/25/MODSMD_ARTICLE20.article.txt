### DICK McLEAN 
About a Lot of Things
Good morning, it's nice to have you hack on cam
pus. llow was the ski trip? Have fun? How do the
old ankles feel? Knees? Head hurt a bit perhaps?
What does the check hook look 1 i!•: o now? Oh well,
daddy will pick up the hack chocks. He always has
before. Tell me, get any studying done?
Don't mind me. I'm just bitter because I couldn't
go skiing this week end. (An old football injury—an
irrational fear of having my leg torn ofT )
Or . . .

Good morning, hell of a day
Isn't it. But all Mondays are that
way. Black. Look outside. If it's
not raining now, it will later. I'll
bet before noontime some dis
gruntled professor will hit you
v/ith a pop quiz. (Monday is their
favorite day. They get a better
distribution that way. From
minus minus to "C" minus.)
Have you picked up your mail
yet? There's probably a cinch

notice or a valentine from the draft board. Good old
Monday! Why not go back to bed? Tuesday is a
much nicer day.
Or . . .
Good morning, GREAT day isn't it? Just look
outside! The rainy days are just about over. Pretty
soon it's going to be Santa Cruz time again. Spring
vacation's coming. Think of all the line things that
are going to happen this morning.
Maybe one of your classes will be called off. Pvlaybe
someone will send you money in the mail. Maybe
the Records Office will discover there's been a huge
mistake. Somebody else in the University with the
same name as yours has been getting your grades by
mistake. They'll nolify you that you're not on pro
bation at all but instead a candidate for Phi Beta
Kappa. Don't waste your time reading Bull Session.
Get out and live.
Or . . .
Good morning, aren't you glad you stayed on cam
pur, over the weekend now that it's Monday? There
was no crowd at the reserve book room; plenty of
parking spaces, Aren't you happy to have the term
paper done so early in the quarter? What! You didn't,
finish it. Why not? The basketball game, you say.
Great series wasn't it? I think Forrest Twogood,
the CSC coach, would make a line wrestling instruc
tor. Those exquisite facial expressions: rage, anger,
disgust, frustration, heroic defeat. I'll never forget
the moment on Saturday night when Stanford went
into its strategic stall. Twogood stomped out of the
Pavilion in disgust but returned a minute later to

give his boys a dramatic "charge." For a second I
though! it was Teddy Roosevelt. Bui T.R.'s boys
wen,
I heard a rumor at the game Saturday. It was to
the effect that SC's Morton, the red headed foul
specialist, was really Pat Cannamella with his hair
dyed. It could be. Right height. Right build. Same
snarl .

Nov/ that I've said good morning" to everyone, I
want to tell a true story. I've been trying to find
a place to use this one for a lone time. It's not
enough for a full page nor short enough for a quip.
So I'll just give you the naked facts of the case.
11 was I adies Day at Encina, one of those rare
days when the mother, sisters and sweethearts could
legally go upstairs into the battered but hallowed
rooms. The pin-up pictures had been duly re
moved; the friendly exhortations of former tenants
had been erased from (he walls; the word has been
spread throughout Lncina: Saturday was to be
Ladies' Day.
Everybody got the word. That is, almost everybody,
One poor fellow hadn't heard or had heard and
forgotten. Well anyway, he rolled out of bed late
and whipped down for a shower. He had a gay old
time in the shower, bellowing, singing, and soaping.
He finished off with a blast, of cold Water and then
jaunted down the hall toward his room. Happy as
a freshly bathed canary. His towel over his shoulder.
Halfway down the hall he heard a sound that was
unmistakably the squeal of laughing girls. "Girls
in fcneina?" he thought. "Could it he?" But just
then two girls rounded the corner and started
toward him. They were looking al a piece of paper
with a room number on it and hadn't looked up yet.
To make the situation even worse the poor fellow
knew the girls. They were from his home town, His
towel was too small to fit all the way around him
and there was no time to duck into a doorway. It
would be bad enough to be caught in a towel by
strangers but by girls from home . . . He could hear
his friends at home tittering already.
But, this was a Stanford man intelligent, quick
witted. With a lightening motion he whipped the
towel around his face and head and strode leisurely
by.
By my book, that's really quick thinking.

End of story, time for a riddle. It comes from Pro
fessor John Miller of the History Department.
Riddle: If the Pilgrims came over on the May
flower, what did the midgets come over on?
Answer: The Shrimp Boats.
Damn sorry about the riddle. But I've just gotta
get a good grade out of history IG.I. See you all
tomorrow.
