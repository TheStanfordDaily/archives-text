# Physics Head Returns Here After Talks
## 
### 
Dr. Leonard I. Schiff, executive
head ol the Stanford Physics De
partment, has returned to the cam
pus after an Eastern trip during
which he delivered three lectures
as a visiting professor at lowa State
College and the Institute for Atomic
Research at Ames, lowa.
These lectures dealt witli the op
eration of the synchrotron and also
with his recent research on the non
linear meson theory of nuclear
forces. lowa State has a 70-million
volt synchrotron.
Four other members of the Phys
ics Department staff have made re
cent trips East to attend scientific
meetings.
Professor W. K. H. Panofsky at
tended a trip to an invitational, con
ference on high-energy physics at
the University of Rochester.
Professors W. E. Lamb and Felix
Bloch attended the American Phys
ical Society meetings in New York
along with Dr. Schiff.
Dr. Sidney Drell, instructor in
physics, attended the Physical So
ciety meetings and then visited the
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy, when he yive a special semi
nar lecture on his recent research
on the production of mesons by
high-energy gamma rays.
