### 
Did Bob Burnett do wrong in going into the deep freeze over the weekend
to win ;i pair of crucial games from the bruising Trojan five?
We, for one, would like to go to bat for Stanford's new coach. So far, Bob
and the Stanford five have received quite a beating in the papers and in
campus bull sessions. Most of it is unfair, unrealistic, and not based on fact.
Accord in" to every tradition and objective in American sports, the general

idea is to win. Naturally, we believe, and certainly
Bob most fervently believes, that the only way to play
the game is according to the rules and in a sporting
manner. Sportsmanship is therefore the key to, arid a
requirement of, a real sports winner.
The Stanford basketball plavers are very versatile.
Tliey are lightning fast and have great sewing abil
ity. Everybody agrees to this. Forrest Twogood, SC
coach, said, "Stanford is the fastest team in the na
tion and one of the highest scoring."
In an attempt to utilize this great versatility and
compensate for the tremendous lack of height and
size, Burnett has tried just about every trick in the
books all season long. lie's used a booming fast break,

zone de'ense, lull court press. He even added a twist of his own—the second
platoon. All were experiments. All were in an elfort to fulfill his job.
Th twenty or so games that the current Card team had played demon
strated their explosive ability in the scoring department. In nearly every
game, the Indians have held at least a 12 point margin. But they have
usually won or lost by a scant nine points or less. The defeats and huge
scores by opponents have been through lack ol size and ability on the back
boards, riot because of poor defense.
The Stanfords are very weak on the boards and important rebounds.
Jim Ramstead does more than his share. Tucker and Walsh don't have the
knack of picking them off consistently. Suzdaleff and Tomsic do not have
the physical qualifications.
What would you do if you were coaching such a team, especially against
the size and strength that SC V has on the hoards? Proper analysis can only
point to one thing if and when you are fortunate enough to build up a
quick lead. And that's use your speed and quickness to best advantage.
Open up the game, play possession ball, and make the opponents come out
to you.
Because Mr. "wogood was stubborn and refused to send his squad out
after the agile Cards is not Stanford's fault. And then Mr. Twogood claims
that it wasn't sportsmanlike and fair because it didn't give the opponent
a chance to m;ike a comeback. But he knows that the man in possession of
the ball must move it within five seconds as soon as he is guarded. The
ball-controller is required to pass off, take a shot, or dribble within the five
second period. What more can be asked?
The Troian mentor explained his refusal to play ball this way: "I have
my rights don't I? You wanted to play ball one way, and I wanted to play
the other. How's that for an answer?" Admittedly he was pretty steamed
lip when he made that statement. The next night he re-explained his re
fusal to go out and get the ball: "I felt that by making your boys stand
around and doing nothing would make them lose their tempers and then
ruin their timing. This could throw off their shooting."
That's relying on a lot of pure wishful thinking, and not on good horse
sense. The rules provided his Trojan players with the opportunity to get
the bull and narrow the gap. That is if they had the playing ability to inter
cept the ball without fouling.
The stalling game is nothing new. Sam Barry, former head coach at USC
for many years and Twogood's ex-coach and ex-boss, was one of the greatest
exponents of the stall. In the early '30's, his team once played a 19 to 17
game with UCLA that included a nine minute stall and had both coaches
reading newspapers on the bench.
Both coaches, Burnett and Twogood, and most other cage ftfficials agree
that some radical changes are necessary to improve the game. For one
thing, the optional free throw should be eliminated. But before this can
be done, the penalty for intentional fouling must be increased. But the
weekend games were played under current rules.
As far as the type of ball the Trojan crew plays, we'll leave that for
another day. They play more than hard. What better evidence is the year
in-and-year-out size and type of player attracted on the SC Varsity?
Anyhow, Coach Bob Burnett has engineered the speedy Card five into
a title-contender role. The Indians must whip the faltering Bears twice to
stay in the loop picture. We think the Indians can. Whether Burnett will
play possession ball or not against Cal is his choice. We think he will if
given the opportunity.

that some radical changes are necessary to improve the game. For one
thing, the optional free throw should be eliminated. But before this can
be done, the penalty for intentional fouling must be increased. But the
weekend games were played under current rules.
As far as the type of ball the Trojan crew plays, we'll leave that for
another day. They play more than hard. What better evidence is the year
in-and-year-out size and type of player attracted on the SC Varsity?
Anyhow, Coach Bob Burnett has engineered the speedy Card five into
a title-contender role. The Indians must whip the faltering Bears twice to
stay in the loop picture. We think the Indians can. Whether Burnett will
play possession ball or not against Cal is his choice. We think he will if
given the opportunity.

Did Bob Burnett do wrong in going into the deep freeze over the weekend
to win ;i pair of crucial games from the bruising Trojan five?
We, for one, would like to go to bat for Stanford's new coach. So far, Bob
and the Stanford five have received quite a beating in the papers and in
campus bull sessions. Most of it is unfair, unrealistic, and not based on fact.
Accord in" to every tradition and objective in American sports, the general

idea is to win. Naturally, we believe, and certainly
Bob most fervently believes, that the only way to play
the game is according to the rules and in a sporting
manner. Sportsmanship is therefore the key to, arid a
requirement of, a real sports winner.
The Stanford basketball plavers are very versatile.
Tliey are lightning fast and have great sewing abil
ity. Everybody agrees to this. Forrest Twogood, SC
coach, said, "Stanford is the fastest team in the na
tion and one of the highest scoring."
In an attempt to utilize this great versatility and
compensate for the tremendous lack of height and
size, Burnett has tried just about every trick in the
books all season long. lie's used a booming fast break,

zone de'ense, lull court press. He even added a twist of his own—the second
platoon. All were experiments. All were in an elfort to fulfill his job.
Th twenty or so games that the current Card team had played demon
strated their explosive ability in the scoring department. In nearly every
game, the Indians have held at least a 12 point margin. But they have
usually won or lost by a scant nine points or less. The defeats and huge
scores by opponents have been through lack ol size and ability on the back
boards, riot because of poor defense.
The Stanfords are very weak on the boards and important rebounds.
Jim Ramstead does more than his share. Tucker and Walsh don't have the
knack of picking them off consistently. Suzdaleff and Tomsic do not have
the physical qualifications.
What would you do if you were coaching such a team, especially against
the size and strength that SC V has on the hoards? Proper analysis can only
point to one thing if and when you are fortunate enough to build up a
quick lead. And that's use your speed and quickness to best advantage.
Open up the game, play possession ball, and make the opponents come out
to you.
Because Mr. "wogood was stubborn and refused to send his squad out
after the agile Cards is not Stanford's fault. And then Mr. Twogood claims
that it wasn't sportsmanlike and fair because it didn't give the opponent
a chance to m;ike a comeback. But he knows that the man in possession of
the ball must move it within five seconds as soon as he is guarded. The
ball-controller is required to pass off, take a shot, or dribble within the five
second period. What more can be asked?
The Troian mentor explained his refusal to play ball this way: "I have
my rights don't I? You wanted to play ball one way, and I wanted to play
the other. How's that for an answer?" Admittedly he was pretty steamed
lip when he made that statement. The next night he re-explained his re
fusal to go out and get the ball: "I felt that by making your boys stand
around and doing nothing would make them lose their tempers and then
ruin their timing. This could throw off their shooting."
That's relying on a lot of pure wishful thinking, and not on good horse
sense. The rules provided his Trojan players with the opportunity to get
the bull and narrow the gap. That is if they had the playing ability to inter
cept the ball without fouling.
The stalling game is nothing new. Sam Barry, former head coach at USC
for many years and Twogood's ex-coach and ex-boss, was one of the greatest
exponents of the stall. In the early '30's, his team once played a 19 to 17
game with UCLA that included a nine minute stall and had both coaches
reading newspapers on the bench.

ruin their timing. This could throw off their shooting."
That's relying on a lot of pure wishful thinking, and not on good horse
sense. The rules provided his Trojan players with the opportunity to get
the bull and narrow the gap. That is if they had the playing ability to inter
cept the ball without fouling.
The stalling game is nothing new. Sam Barry, former head coach at USC
for many years and Twogood's ex-coach and ex-boss, was one of the greatest
exponents of the stall. In the early '30's, his team once played a 19 to 17
game with UCLA that included a nine minute stall and had both coaches
reading newspapers on the bench.
Both coaches, Burnett and Twogood, and most other cage ftfficials agree
that some radical changes are necessary to improve the game. For one
thing, the optional free throw should be eliminated. But before this can
be done, the penalty for intentional fouling must be increased. But the
weekend games were played under current rules.
As far as the type of ball the Trojan crew plays, we'll leave that for
another day. They play more than hard. What better evidence is the year
in-and-year-out size and type of player attracted on the SC Varsity?
Anyhow, Coach Bob Burnett has engineered the speedy Card five into
a title-contender role. The Indians must whip the faltering Bears twice to
stay in the loop picture. We think the Indians can. Whether Burnett will
play possession ball or not against Cal is his choice. We think he will if
given the opportunity.

Did Bob Burnett do wrong in going into the deep freeze over the weekend
to win ;i pair of crucial games from the bruising Trojan five?
We, for one, would like to go to bat for Stanford's new coach. So far, Bob
and the Stanford five have received quite a beating in the papers and in
campus bull sessions. Most of it is unfair, unrealistic, and not based on fact.
Accord in" to every tradition and objective in American sports, the general

idea is to win. Naturally, we believe, and certainly
Bob most fervently believes, that the only way to play
the game is according to the rules and in a sporting
manner. Sportsmanship is therefore the key to, arid a
requirement of, a real sports winner.
The Stanford basketball plavers are very versatile.
Tliey are lightning fast and have great sewing abil
ity. Everybody agrees to this. Forrest Twogood, SC
coach, said, "Stanford is the fastest team in the na
tion and one of the highest scoring."
In an attempt to utilize this great versatility and
compensate for the tremendous lack of height and
size, Burnett has tried just about every trick in the
books all season long. lie's used a booming fast break,

zone de'ense, lull court press. He even added a twist of his own—the second
platoon. All were experiments. All were in an elfort to fulfill his job.
Th twenty or so games that the current Card team had played demon
strated their explosive ability in the scoring department. In nearly every
game, the Indians have held at least a 12 point margin. But they have
usually won or lost by a scant nine points or less. The defeats and huge
scores by opponents have been through lack ol size and ability on the back
boards, riot because of poor defense.
The Stanfords are very weak on the boards and important rebounds.
Jim Ramstead does more than his share. Tucker and Walsh don't have the
knack of picking them off consistently. Suzdaleff and Tomsic do not have
the physical qualifications.
What would you do if you were coaching such a team, especially against
the size and strength that SC V has on the hoards? Proper analysis can only
point to one thing if and when you are fortunate enough to build up a
quick lead. And that's use your speed and quickness to best advantage.
Open up the game, play possession ball, and make the opponents come out
to you.
Because Mr. "wogood was stubborn and refused to send his squad out
after the agile Cards is not Stanford's fault. And then Mr. Twogood claims
that it wasn't sportsmanlike and fair because it didn't give the opponent
a chance to m;ike a comeback. But he knows that the man in possession of
the ball must move it within five seconds as soon as he is guarded. The
ball-controller is required to pass off, take a shot, or dribble within the five
second period. What more can be asked?
The Troian mentor explained his refusal to play ball this way: "I have
my rights don't I? You wanted to play ball one way, and I wanted to play
the other. How's that for an answer?" Admittedly he was pretty steamed
lip when he made that statement. The next night he re-explained his re
fusal to go out and get the ball: "I felt that by making your boys stand
around and doing nothing would make them lose their tempers and then
ruin their timing. This could throw off their shooting."
