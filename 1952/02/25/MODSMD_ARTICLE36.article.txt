easily, 65-32, while East Contra
Costa was overpowered 78 to 60.

since. Their record is now 16
and 5.
The Cards got oft to a sloppy
start in the Santa Rosa game,
amassing but a 19-14 lead at the
half-time. The Braves and John

son then proceeded to go wild, scor
ing 28 points, 15 by Johnson,
Santa Rosa's 12 in the third quar
ter. The pace slowed down slightly
in the fourth period and the final
score was 65-32.

much different. In East (ontra
Costa, the Braves met a team that
was completely dead from 10 to

led by as much as 23 points in the
third quarter.

Lockhart with 20, Jim Westphal
