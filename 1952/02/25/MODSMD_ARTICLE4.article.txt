was forced to flee the Nazis and
came to the United States, where
for the duration he worked and
appeared for the benefit of the
Czech government-in-exile.
Since the war he has performed
with most of the symphony orches
tras of both Europe and the United
States. Last spring he gave con
certs throughout Europe and re
turned to the United States in July
for the Aspen Festival in- Aspen,
Colorado.
