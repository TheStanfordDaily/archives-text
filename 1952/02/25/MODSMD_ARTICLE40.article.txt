## 
### 
Stanford's rugby team notched
their lirst win ol the season Satur
day as they toppled the Palo Alto
Ramblers, 10-3.
The ruggers trailed 3-0 at half
time, the Rambler score coming on
a 30 - yard penalty kick by Fats
Cardoza midway in the first half.
With 20 minutes gone in the sec
ond half, Don Mueller of Stanford
got off a 50-yard punt out of bounds
to put the ball at the midfield stripe.
Wes Laubscher got the ball on the
line-out and scooted for 40 yards,
shaking off two Ramblers en route.
Trapped, he lateraled to Norm Ma
noogian who bulled for live more.
Manoogian fed off to Harry Snell,
the scrum half, who touched the ball
down in the end zone for the try.
Kirkland converted and Stanford
had a 5-3 lead.
Seven minutes later Ron Cook

broke through, eluded the entire
Rambler secorulaty, and outran
lullback Elio Cand&rle for the score.
The run covered 70 yards. Kirkland
again converted and Stanford had
| 10-3 lead they never gave up.
A chief factor in the Card win
was the inspired play Jjy the entire
forward wall.
Even Russ Latham, the former
Stanford and British Cohimbia star,
didn't have a chance to do anything
because the Rambler front rankers
couldn't get the ball away from the
Cards.
