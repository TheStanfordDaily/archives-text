# French Students Visit Stanford
## 
### 

AROUND THE WORLD —Pictured here atop windy Hoover Tower are four French students who
left home 18 months ago with five dollars apiece and have been travelling ever since, working as
they go. Going east through Turkey and Southern Asia, they crossed the Pacific to reach the
United States. Before visiting Stanford they worked in a lumber camp on Vancouver Island. They
recently purchased a car and plan to head south soon for Mexico and the Amazon regions. They
will also be guest speakers at the Maison Francaise tonight when the house holds the first meet
ing of a series of Monday night activities at 3 o'clock. "Around the World on Five Dollars" is
the topic of the talk. All French speaking students are invited to attend.
