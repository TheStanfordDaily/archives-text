# Whitaker Will Discuss Shakespeare
## 
### 
Much of the technique of Shake
speare's plays and many of the
scenes in the plays are the out
come of what Shakespeare studied
as a student in the Stratford gram
mar school.
This is a statement Professor Vir
gil K. Whitaker, head of the Eng
lish Department, will explain to to
morrow night's Tuesday Evening
Series audience in Memorial Audi
torium at 7:,j0. The title of his talk
is "Shakespeare's Boyhood: The
Education of a Dramati. I."
Lr. Whitaker has been working
for some time on a book on the
development of Shakespeare's
thought in which he expounds the
thesis that the development of his
dramatic technique was a result of
his growing understanding of the
best learning of his day.
Work carried out during a year's
sabbatical leave in 1948-49 gave Dr.
Whitaker the material for his lec
ture. He spent this time at the
Huntington Library in San Marino
and, among other things, worked
through textbooks that Shakespeare
is known to have studied from ref
erences in his plays.
Dr. Whitaker succeeded Dr. Rich
ard Foster Jones as head of the
English Department Lit Septem
ber. He has been a member of the
Stanford faculty since 19.'M and
served as department head in 1948
while Dr. Jones was ill. He was
one of the contributors to "The
Seventeenth Century," a collection
of essays published by the Stanford
Press and written in honor of Dr.
Jones' contribution to literature.
"Philosophy and Romance in
Shakespeare's 'Problem' Comedies"
is the title of his er.say.
He is not related to Dr. Douglas
M. Whitaker, dean of the Faculty
of Humanities and Sciences.
