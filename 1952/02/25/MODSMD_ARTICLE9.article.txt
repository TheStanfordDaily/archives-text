## 
### 
The Institute for International Re
lations now has the blueprints for
complete reorganization, thanks to
the report of the Committee on Or
ganization of Student International
Affairs, v/hich Excom approved last
Wednesday night.
Made up of Excom representative
Bill Dickinson and Political Sci
ence Department teaching assistants
Brownlee Corwin and Bob von Pa
genhardt, the committee has been
considering the lIR f-ince Jan. 16. Its
report to Excom last week included
four ba;;ic proposals, general recom
mendations for reorganization, and
suggested changes in the ASSU and

New lilt officers elected Wednes
day a'id approved that night by
Excom were:
Conrad von Bibra, president;
Pat Terry, vice - president; Art
Breisky, executive secretary; Jim
Roberts, business manager.

IIR bylaws to make them conform
with the new setup.
In making the committee's report,
Dickinson stressed that no criticism
of the Hit's work was implied. He
praised the Institute as one of the
campu"most constructive organi
zations" and declared it had done
a great deal to further Stanford's
prestige. He explained the com
mittee felt the lIP needed reorgani
zation only to increase and perform
more efficiently the service it is al
ready doing.
The four basic proposals okayed
by Excom were:
1. The lIR president is to attend
all E'xconi meetings and serve Ex
com as an international relations
adviser.
2. The UK is <0 set up a pam
phlet and document library in the
now unused space in the lIR-Quad
Shack.
The committee explained that ar
rangements could be made with the
World Federalists and the Speleo
logical Society, to which the space
is now assigned, without hampering
these groups' activities. It was point
ed out that this library would make
the Institute's large number of pub
lications on international affairs
readily available to the average
student for term papers.
A foreign student assistance
fund is <0 he started from money
raided by the foreign students
themselves. The fund will be used
for such things as a foreign stu
dent handbook.
1. The Committee on Organiza
tion of Student International Af
fairs is to report to Excom next
spring on the actual success of
the reorganization.
Among the general recommenda
tions was that the lIR recruit stu
dents interested in fields other than
international relations. Examples
were administration, finance, public
relations, and journalism. The ex
planation was that the present set
up does not allow for enough spe
cialization and that routine tasks
aside from actual international re
lations work were not being taken
care of.
Other suggestions included im
provement of communication be
tween the lIR and other campus or
ganizations. Making the lIR presi
dent an adviser to Excom out
of this recommendation.

The Institute for International Re
lations now has the blueprints for
complete reorganization, thanks to
the report of the Committee on Or
ganization of Student International
Affairs, v/hich Excom approved last
Wednesday night.
Made up of Excom representative
Bill Dickinson and Political Sci
ence Department teaching assistants
Brownlee Corwin and Bob von Pa
genhardt, the committee has been
considering the lIR f-ince Jan. 16. Its
report to Excom last week included
four ba;;ic proposals, general recom
mendations for reorganization, and
suggested changes in the ASSU and

New lilt officers elected Wednes
day a'id approved that night by
Excom were:
Conrad von Bibra, president;
Pat Terry, vice - president; Art
Breisky, executive secretary; Jim
Roberts, business manager.

IIR bylaws to make them conform
with the new setup.
In making the committee's report,
Dickinson stressed that no criticism
of the Hit's work was implied. He
praised the Institute as one of the
campu"most constructive organi
zations" and declared it had done
a great deal to further Stanford's
prestige. He explained the com
mittee felt the lIP needed reorgani
zation only to increase and perform
more efficiently the service it is al
ready doing.
The four basic proposals okayed
by Excom were:
1. The lIR president is to attend
all E'xconi meetings and serve Ex
com as an international relations
adviser.
2. The UK is <0 set up a pam
phlet and document library in the
now unused space in the lIR-Quad
Shack.
The committee explained that ar
rangements could be made with the
World Federalists and the Speleo
logical Society, to which the space
is now assigned, without hampering
these groups' activities. It was point
ed out that this library would make
the Institute's large number of pub
lications on international affairs
readily available to the average
student for term papers.
A foreign student assistance
fund is <0 he started from money
raided by the foreign students
themselves. The fund will be used
for such things as a foreign stu
dent handbook.
1. The Committee on Organiza
tion of Student International Af
fairs is to report to Excom next
spring on the actual success of
the reorganization.
Among the general recommenda
tions was that the lIR recruit stu
dents interested in fields other than
international relations. Examples
were administration, finance, public
relations, and journalism. The ex
planation was that the present set
up does not allow for enough spe
cialization and that routine tasks
aside from actual international re
lations work were not being taken
care of.
Other suggestions included im
provement of communication be
tween the lIR and other campus or
ganizations. Making the lIR presi
dent an adviser to Excom out
of this recommendation.
