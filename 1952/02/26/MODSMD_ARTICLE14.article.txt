## Pianist 'Giant' Is Spellbinding 
### RONALD ROSEN 
Rudolph Firkusny, renowned
Czech pianist, performing be
fore a spellbound audience in
Memorial Auditorium, again
gave ample evidence that he is
a giant among the pianists of his
generation.
Opening the program with the
Bach Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue,
Firkusny immediately established
that he not only has excellent tech
nique, but also is capable of the
most subtle shading.
His use of the damper and soft
pedals was always in the best of
taste in this composition, in which
pedaling is very difficult. The mel
ody lines in the fugue were always
brought out with utmost clarity.
In the seldom - heard but de
lightful Variations on a Minuet
by Duport bv Mozart, Firkusny
displayed a wonderful hell - 1 ik<"
tone which would be the envy of
any pianist.
In this composition, as in the
Schubert Impromptus, many pit
falls are provided for the unwary
pianist, but Firkusny'.; sure fingers
had no trouble with either of these
compositions. The melody lines
were beautifully brought out in
both selections.
Firkusny next turned to the
monumental Fantasy in C Major by
Schumann. The technical difficul
ties and the variety of moods which
Schumann poured into this compo
sition limit it only to the programs
of the more talented pianists. Fir
kusny is such a pianist.
Schumann's turbulent and po
etic sides were caught and ex
pressed with all the understand
ing and spirit of a ercat artist.
The tremendous technical diffi
culties of the martial second sec
tion were tossed off with a max
imum of ease and brilliance.
The rhapsodic and wandering
conclusion to the Schumann opus
showed that the soloist is not a
mere technician, but a happy com
bination of technician, poet, and
musician.
After the intermission, Firkusny
launched into the Sonata by the
contemporary American composer,
Samuel Barber. This work cap
tures the pathos and tempestuous
spirit of our modern age, with its
driving undercurrent of restless
ness.
Except for a moment of quiet
reflection in the third movement,
(he music is always driving for
ward, reflecting the turbulence of
the times. Just as Barber's So
nata is a work of creative genius,
Firkusny's performance was a
work of re-creative genius.
The program ended with the
Chopin Barcarolle and two woiks
by Smetana.

generation.
Opening the program with the
Bach Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue,
Firkusny immediately established
that he not only has excellent tech
nique, but also is capable of the
most subtle shading.
His use of the damper and soft
pedals was always in the best of
taste in this composition, in which
pedaling is very difficult. The mel
ody lines in the fugue were always
brought out with utmost clarity.
In the seldom - heard but de
lightful Variations on a Minuet
by Duport bv Mozart, Firkusny
displayed a wonderful hell - 1 ik<"
tone which would be the envy of
any pianist.
In this composition, as in the
Schubert Impromptus, many pit
falls are provided for the unwary
pianist, but Firkusny'.; sure fingers
had no trouble with either of these
compositions. The melody lines
were beautifully brought out in
both selections.
Firkusny next turned to the
monumental Fantasy in C Major by
Schumann. The technical difficul
ties and the variety of moods which
Schumann poured into this compo
sition limit it only to the programs
of the more talented pianists. Fir
kusny is such a pianist.
Schumann's turbulent and po
etic sides were caught and ex
pressed with all the understand
ing and spirit of a ercat artist.
The tremendous technical diffi
culties of the martial second sec
tion were tossed off with a max
imum of ease and brilliance.
The rhapsodic and wandering
conclusion to the Schumann opus
showed that the soloist is not a
mere technician, but a happy com
bination of technician, poet, and
musician.
After the intermission, Firkusny
launched into the Sonata by the
contemporary American composer,
Samuel Barber. This work cap
tures the pathos and tempestuous
spirit of our modern age, with its
driving undercurrent of restless
ness.
Except for a moment of quiet
reflection in the third movement,
(he music is always driving for
ward, reflecting the turbulence of
the times. Just as Barber's So
nata is a work of creative genius,
Firkusny's performance was a
work of re-creative genius.
The program ended with the
Chopin Barcarolle and two woiks
by Smetana.
Rudolph Firkusny, renowned
Czech pianist, performing be
fore a spellbound audience in
Memorial Auditorium, again
gave ample evidence that he is
a giant among the pianists of his
generation.
