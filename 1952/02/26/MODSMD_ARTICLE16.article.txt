# Changing India In Soul Hunt
## 
### 
"Change is in the air in India and
Pakistan, but is undefinable and un
controllable, like riding a tiger and
not knowing where it's going," Phil -
lips Talbot. American University
Field Service lecturer, told an audi
ence in Cubbcrley yesterday after
noon.
Generalizing about impressions
gained on his recent trip through the
two countries, he said, "The Indians
are a people in search of their soul.
College graduates and illiterates
alike are living on hope, probing, ex-

perimenting, unsure of themselves."
Nehru's importance is due, Talhot
believes, to his ability to impart his
own confidence in India's eventual
success.
To the Indians, he continued, prob
lems of survival and growth take
precedent over foreign policy. The
biggest worry is the shortage of food
for the constantly growing popula
tion. Nehru's government has a lime
limit of five years before the next
elections, he said, in which to find
an answer the people can "see and
feel—in their stomachs."
He described Pakistan as a small
boy, shouting, "Look, ma, 110 hands."
Right, now they are seeking a dis
tinctive foreign policy, all their own,
and seem equally opposed .to the
oppression of Communism and the
"inequalities" and "high develop
ment'' of Western capitalism.
