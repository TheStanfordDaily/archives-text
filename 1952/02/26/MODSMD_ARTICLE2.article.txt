## Allies Anticipate Red Refusal In Answer to Truce Proposal 
### 
TOKYO, Tuesday, Feb. 26 (UP) â€” The Communists appeared
cool today toward an Allied "face saving" scheme for easing Rus
sia out of the Korean truce picture and thus solving the touchiest
of three stubborn deadlocks
Allied and Communist staff officers discussing prisoner-ex-

change and supervision of the truce
met in Panmunjom at 11 a.m. (6
p.m. PST Monday) and the Com
munists were cxpected to give their
formal answer then. There were
many indications it would be a re
fusal.
Peiping Radio continued its blasts
today against the "massacre" of
Communist prisoners in United Na
tions compounds and called the
Koje -Do camp "worse than Bu
chenwald." Communist-led intern
err? rioted there last Monday.
The UN compromise truce super
vision plan woidd drop Norway,
giving each side two nations as
members of neutral teams to see
that terms of the Korean armistice
were being carried out.
A Chinese staff officer scowled at
the plan when it was presented
yesterday. He parroted the Com
munist contention that the Allies
had no right to veto Russia. But
he did leave it at that, and take
the proposal back to his base camp.
