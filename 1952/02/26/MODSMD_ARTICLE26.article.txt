# UNIVERSITY BOOSTS ROOM-BOARD RATES
## Increases Up to $25 Take Effect Next Fall 
### 
In rin edict affecting more than 3,L>00 students, President J. E.
Wallace Sterling announced yesterday that room and board iates
in University residences will be increased from $12.50 to $25 a
quarter effective next fall.
The increase—the first in board and room since November, 1947

-was necessitated by the skyrock
eting food and operating costs, coup -
led with a tight University budget.
Unaffected by the increase will
be the fraternities where, IPC Pres
ident Tony Ganett said yesterday,
no rise in rates is expected. Gar
rett explained that the fraternities
hops to forestall the need for a
price rise because of two reasons
He cited the large pledge class
this year as the initial deterrent to
any rise. Secondly, the 24 fraterni
ties are joining together to form a
co-operative and buy their food
through a commissary.
The not - so - fortunate Univer
sity residence dwellers, however,
will feel the price rise with dif
ferent intensities, depending on
the individual accommodations.
In general, $15 will go to meet
the rising food costs, and $10 will
cover the housing expenses which
have gone up in recent years on all
fronts, ranging from insurance to
the cost of brooms.
Present room and board rates
lange from $215 to $240 a quarter
for men, and there is a uniform
$225 charge far women. Under
the increase, the range for men
will be from $240 to $265, and
$250 for women.
Specifically, Stanford Village will
be affected the least. There, where
board has cost $150, the new board
rate will be $160 a quarter. Single
room rentals will go up from 560 to
$65; double rooms, from $50 to $55;
triple rooms, from $42.50 to $46,
and quadruple rooms, from $35 to
$37.50.
In triple and quadruple rooms ab
Encina and Toyon, the $10 rental
increase will be divided among tho
number of men living in each room.
Stern men and all the women stu
dents will have to dig deepest into
their pockets as they will feel the
full $25 increase.
Dr. Sterling said the increased
rates were adopted with reluc
tance, but they were compelled
by higher costs of food and ot
almost al! University housing op
erations. The rates were decided
upon by the Board of Trustees in
their regular monthly meeting
held last Thursday.
Before the last board increases in
1947, the rates for eating in Uni
versity residences were $15 les:;
than at the present, time. Prior to
that time, in May of 1946, the boar d
rates for men had been upped $17,
and $12 for women, with a $5 in
crease for rooms.
Since 1948, however, food pricci
in the San Francisco area have
risen 12 per cent, according to the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The Consumers' Price Index,
which includes all items entei ing
into the cost of living, has risen
about the same amount in a com
parable period of time.
The new room and board rate",
President Sterling said, are com
parable to those of many other uni
versities.
At the University of Chicago, for
example, in effect during 1951 5 1
room and board rates were -i>772 pe.<
academic year for men, $745 for
women.
At Mills, boaid and room for the
last academic year was $703. fc
Vassal - , for 1952-53, the rate will
be $1,075, compared to a yearly cost
of $750 for Stanford women.
