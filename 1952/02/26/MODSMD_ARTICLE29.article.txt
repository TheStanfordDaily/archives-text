### 
The lIR reorganization plan approved by Ex
corn last week is an example ol concrete work
on tv/o areas ol the Stanford scene currently
being criticized: efficiency in student govern
ment and student-faculty relations.
Altei much hard work on the part of both the
lIR and the Committee on Organization cf Stu
dent International Affairs, a more professional
organization was planned for the Institute. Di
rect lines of responsibility were suggested: a
more effective personnel program v/as pro
posed; and methods were brought out lor im
proving the Ifß's communications with the rest
of the University. All this should result in more
efficient performance of the splendid work the
Institute is already doing.

Assisting Excom Representative Bill Dickin
son on the reorganization committee were Bob
von Pagenhardt and Brownlee Corwin, teach
ing assistants in the Political Science Depart
ment. For more than a month these three men
have taken time from their studies and other
duties to completely analyze the lIR.
An idea of the amount of work they have
done may be seen in the tact that besides woik
ing oui a complete list of general recommenda
tions and constitutional changes, they prepared
a 35 page report on specific techniques lor im
proving all levels ol lIR organization.
We heartily re-echo Excom's vote of thanks
to this committee. —Dorothy Dodg®
