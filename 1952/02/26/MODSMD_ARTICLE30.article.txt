Adventure

The secret of eternal youth is adventure.
Adventure is not the dissipater of the soul
as the dull people will have you believe.
It is instead the strengtheuer and the re
juvenator of that golden speck of God-dust.
Adventure is life as it should be lived. And
adventure is found where you will take it.
—Charles Durham Jr.
The truth of the matter is that college is sometimes
pretty dull Oh, it has its moments. Big Games. Big
Game parties. The first tiip to Rossotti's. The first
visit to the Cactus Garden. But for the most part it
can be a bore. Total up all the dull hours spent over
dusty books. Think ol all the sleepy hours in class
where you sit and play stenographer to the rumblings
of a professor. Sounds pretty prosaic. Huh?
But college need n&t be dull. No siree.
As life can be beautiful, college can be an adventure.
But you've got to make i! thus. Adventure must be
sought out The only trick is knowi'"" 3 how in find it.
"M - J-. . . 1 1c

Now to he a real adventure col
lege must have the essential in
gredients: suspense, danger, anxi
ety, conflict, and glory. Here's
how any one of you can turn the
tables on boredom and make your
career at Stanford as drama
packed as "Robinson ( i usoe."
One method of finding adven
ture is to play the "numbers"
game. But instead of gambling
with money, you play with glad?

points. The secret for a successful and exciting four
years is called the "Brink of Disaster" theory.
You hang on (tie edge of minus 20 for one quarter
and then go plus II to just gel oh' probation. (This
is. a great way to frustrate the happy soul who sends
out the "bounce" notices.) Totter on the edge of
probation for a while, (ll keeps the adiiiinistratiun
on their toes.) Just for kirks, slip bad* on proba
tion, (The notice is all set lo !•«» home to (he folks.)
Then in a burst of glory go all the way to plus zero.
Try to fluctuate only a few points from this norm
during the remaining years. Get a little bil minus in

your next to last quarter. (Will you graduate?) As
a finishing touch, end up plus 1 just to show every
body that you can do it it you want to.
The hungry, snapping jaws of the draft board lying
in wait just, outside the main gates of the campus will
heighten the tempo of this sport for the men.
For the girls, Pappy's angry threat, "Daninit, honey,
if you roll out, I'll put you back to work in the juke
mill," is stimulus enough.
Another method of creating adventure is to plan
your time. Not the way a "mole" does but according
to the "Big Push" theory. Let the quarter slip by
until one of your friends says, "Look, old man, you're
never going to pass this course. You haven't been to
any lectures. You haven't read the book. You can't
possibly make it." What has been an ordinary course
suddenly becomes a challenge, an issue, and adven
ture. You say to yourself, "Can I do it? Will I flunk?"
A simple five unit course, that you must pass to
graduate, becomes almost important.
On the night before the final you make an heroic
all-night-stand. In twelve hours you must digest
the entire quarter's work. (The tension mounts.)
You borrow the moles notes as he toddles smugly
off to bed at 8 o'clock. "They'll hold up your gradu
ation if you don't pass tomorrow," he chirps. (What
more anxiety could you ask for?) "You haven't got
a prayer," he adds. (Real conflict is interjected.)
You wave the dull one ofi with a wry smile then
put on the coffee pot, open a fresh carton of ciga
rettes, and begin.
All through the night you race the clock around.
The strong, black liquid keeps the axones and the
dendrites pulsating their electric magic. The gray
cigarette smoke keeps the mind dusted free of cob
webs. By midnight a slight intellectual dawn is
breaking. By four o'clock, though your eyes are tired,
you see the course more clearly. With the sunrise
you are fitting the last pieces of the academic jigg
saw puzzle together. At 8 a.m. you take the test.
You pass. Not the highest "C" in the class. (As
a matter ot fact, the lowest.) But you pass.
And as you take the weary body home and lay
it tenderly to rest, you free a strange lightness
within ,v«ur soul. It's as if you've slain a dragon,
climbed a mountain, or fought a wild bull. It's that
feeling of adventure.

Adventure

The secret of eternal youth is adventure.
Adventure is not the dissipater of the soul
as the dull people will have you believe.
It is instead the strengtheuer and the re
juvenator of that golden speck of God-dust.
Adventure is life as it should be lived. And
adventure is found where you will take it.
—Charles Durham Jr.
The truth of the matter is that college is sometimes
pretty dull Oh, it has its moments. Big Games. Big
Game parties. The first tiip to Rossotti's. The first
visit to the Cactus Garden. But for the most part it
can be a bore. Total up all the dull hours spent over
dusty books. Think ol all the sleepy hours in class
where you sit and play stenographer to the rumblings
of a professor. Sounds pretty prosaic. Huh?
But college need n&t be dull. No siree.

The hungry, snapping jaws of the draft board lying

Another method of creating adventure is to plan
your time. Not the way a "mole" does but according
to the "Big Push" theory. Let the quarter slip by
until one of your friends says, "Look, old man, you're
never going to pass this course. You haven't been to
any lectures. You haven't read the book. You can't
possibly make it." What has been an ordinary course
suddenly becomes a challenge, an issue, and adven

A simple five unit course, that you must pass to
graduate, becomes almost important.
On the night before the final you make an heroic

You borrow the moles notes as he toddles smugly
off to bed at 8 o'clock. "They'll hold up your gradu

cigarette smoke keeps the mind dusted free of cob
webs. By midnight a slight intellectual dawn is
breaking. By four o'clock, though your eyes are tired,
you see the course more clearly. With the sunrise
you are fitting the last pieces of the academic jigg
saw puzzle together. At 8 a.m. you take the test.
You pass. Not the highest "C" in the class. (As

And as you take the weary body home and lay

climbed a mountain, or fought a wild bull. It's that
feeling of adventure.

Adventure

The secret of eternal youth is adventure.
Adventure is not the dissipater of the soul
as the dull people will have you believe.
It is instead the strengtheuer and the re
juvenator of that golden speck of God-dust.
Adventure is life as it should be lived. And
adventure is found where you will take it.

visit to the Cactus Garden. But for the most part it
