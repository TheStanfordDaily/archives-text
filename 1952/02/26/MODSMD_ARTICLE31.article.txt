# CAMPUS OPINION
## Partisan Politics at University of Michigan 
### 
To the Editor:
Stanford University should encourage political
action on its campus. It is the lack ot political ac
tion that is causing the crime and con uption in gov
ernment. Political action is that process by which
the many diverse interests are compromised into
government that is compatible with the public in
terest. It is when there is no politic:! 1 action that
there is trouble.
It seems that the authorities are afraid that left
wing groups might appear if the Young Republicans
were recognized. There is nothing wrong with that.
It is a slap at our intelligent e if they do not believe
that we could see them for what they are.
Looking at other campuses, these schools are
not hurt by partisan political groups At ihe Uni
versity of Michigan, with which I am familiar,
there is an array of such organizations: Young
Republicans, Young Democrats, Young Progies
sives, Americans for Democratic Action, and
others,
These groups accomplish much. When the Young
Republicans brought Stassen to the campus, some
5,000 students filled the auditorium to hear him.
When the same group held a Big Ten Conference
of Young Republican Clubs, the University aided
them. The Conference drafted a platform which was
later sent to the members of Congress.

These students were taking a part in trying to
create good government. They made themselves
heard. They are ready to be good citizens. When
the Young Progressives held a conference on cam
pus, student interest was aroused. The students
were able to evaluate these forces, and to recog
nize their dangers. They did not need to be con
cealed from such thoughts.
'ihe Young Republicans in 1950 conducted an
absentee voting information booth. Several hun
dred students were helped to vote and their po
litical attihation was net asked. They probably
would not have voted otherwise. The Young Re
publicans and Ihe Young Democrats held a seiies
of debates on vital issues. The students took an
interest in these, and they were well attended.
Ihe fair name of Ihe University of Michigan was
not soiled by these activities.
Stanford is failing its students if it denies them
the right to have recognized political groups and to
be, consequently, an aroused and informed electo
rate. Stanford owes this to its students and to the
United States.
