WASHINGTON â€” The United
States is committed formally to the
aid of 33 countries if they are at
tacked and soon will have "all for
one, one for all" agreements with
four others, a survey showed today.
The commitment is laid down in
such mutual defense agreements as
the 1947 Rio Pact signed by 21
Western Hemisphere nations, the
1949 North Atlantic Pact signed by

14 countries, and the proposed trea
ties with Japan, Australia, New
Zealand, and the Philippines.
The United States has defensive
ties with only 33 nations, however,
since some countries signed both
the hemisphere and NATO pacts.
The Pacific pacts will bring the to
tal to 37.
While the treaties do not call for
use of force in the event of an at
tack, the effect of the agreements is
such that the United States would
be expected to light. Its position as
he citadel of the free world adds to
this obligation.
