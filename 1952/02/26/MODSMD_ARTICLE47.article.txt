### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
The 1952 Stanford-USC basketball series is already history. During the
weekend, Stanford proved itself to be the better team, but aside lrom being
a contest between two teams, the games brought out a contest between two
distinct coaching systems.
In when Sam Barry took over at the helm of USC he introduced a
somewhat unique system of play; namely that in order to make up for
whatever the team lacked in ability, it should be extra-aggressive. The
rules of the game are flexible, and if a coach can take advantage of a
1-oorly-defined point, to aid hin cause, so much the better.
in Ihowever, Everett Dean introduced to Stanford a system that
lias made him one of the most highly-respected and best-loved men ever
to In l connected wi(h the game. II went a little deeper (han the actual
playing of the game; it was a way of life. The main thing it stressed was
that a basketball coach, or a coach in any sport has a tremendous re
sponsibility; not only to his school and to the boys he comes in contact
vvilh, but to the game itself.
It is up t:> that coach to try to interpret to (he best of his ability, the
spirit of the rules of, the game as well as the letter. II lie does his and then
abides by his decision, he is aiding the game itself and giving the players
he coaches a good illustration of the meaning of sportsmanship.
In other words, the main difference between the Barry and the Dean
system is that one system stresses winning the game, and the other, im
proving the game and training the players in good sportsmanship.
Ruriiell and Twogood dairying On
Rob Burnett has introduced new methods such as die two-platoon
system and the delayed offense, but the main coaching philosophy is the
came as that of Dean. There is no room for a dirty player on the Stan
ford team.
Another important illustration of the system is the fact that both on
and off the court, Bob Burnett is a gentleman. During a game, the Stanford
bench is a picture of (joi.se and calmness. A word ot encouragement here
and there, a comment or two; but there is none of the wildeyed hysterics
of Feerick or Foley; the cold muttering anger of Woolpert, or the Hollywood
dramatics of Twogood. Instead the coaching stall is calm, and it is easy
to see why this attitude is such a tremendous asset to (he temperament
of the players.
Friday night wo happened to run into Forrest Twogood after the game
end we put a few questions to him;
To the question of why he didn't ro out earlier to try to break up the
stull, Twogood replied, "1 didn't feel like it. What do you think of that?"
We tried rewording the question. This time we got: "I have my rights
don't I? You wanted to play ball oneway, I wanted to play another. How's
that for an answer?"
We asked him what the post-game row was between him and Stanford
trainer Connie Jarvis. He replied, "One guy was popping off so I went
for him."
Of course we had talked to u coach who had just lost a tough hall
game. The situation was a strained one, but we have talked to Boh
Burnett and other coaches after dropping toughies and we never got
anything quite like that.
Does SC Deliberately Foul?
Another question arises. Does SC deliberately foul? Alter watching
SC basketball for three years, it is my opinion and the opinion of many
others that they definitely do.
USC committed 70 fouls during the weekend, compared to the 39 by
Stanford. Etl Tucker and Ron Tomsic spent a great part of each evening
in the first row, in fact Tomsic was knocked groggy Friday and had to
leave the game. Also, why should such a normally calm player like Ram
stead suddenly lose his temper?
Another point to add. Just what is a player like Boh Morton doing on
a basketball court? The USC basketball brochure will tell you he is "big
and rugged and a pood shot." We'll agree with the first two. To look at
the charts we find that against Stanford during the weekend he took six

floor shots, mostly from in close,
and connected with one. Oh yes,
he collected a (otal of one rehound
in both nights. Just another litile
point. Why wouldn't Morion shake
hands when Tomsic offered (o after
Bob had bounced the little guard
into the second row?
Well, we could go on indefinitely
but I think (lie point is clear. We
here at Stanford .should be especially
thankful that we have a coach like
Burnett and players like Tucker,
Tomsic, and Ramstead to root for
instead of the likes of Twogood and
Morton.

somewhat unique system of play; namely that in order to make up for
whatever the team lacked in ability, it should be extra-aggressive. The
rules of the game are flexible, and if a coach can take advantage of a
1-oorly-defined point, to aid hin cause, so much the better.
in Ihowever, Everett Dean introduced to Stanford a system that
lias made him one of the most highly-respected and best-loved men ever
to In l connected wi(h the game. II went a little deeper (han the actual
playing of the game; it was a way of life. The main thing it stressed was
that a basketball coach, or a coach in any sport has a tremendous re
sponsibility; not only to his school and to the boys he comes in contact
vvilh, but to the game itself.
It is up t:> that coach to try to interpret to (he best of his ability, the
spirit of the rules of, the game as well as the letter. II lie does his and then
abides by his decision, he is aiding the game itself and giving the players
he coaches a good illustration of the meaning of sportsmanship.
In other words, the main difference between the Barry and the Dean
system is that one system stresses winning the game, and the other, im
proving the game and training the players in good sportsmanship.
Ruriiell and Twogood dairying On
Rob Burnett has introduced new methods such as die two-platoon
system and the delayed offense, but the main coaching philosophy is the
came as that of Dean. There is no room for a dirty player on the Stan
ford team.
Another important illustration of the system is the fact that both on
and off the court, Bob Burnett is a gentleman. During a game, the Stanford
bench is a picture of (joi.se and calmness. A word ot encouragement here
and there, a comment or two; but there is none of the wildeyed hysterics
of Feerick or Foley; the cold muttering anger of Woolpert, or the Hollywood
dramatics of Twogood. Instead the coaching stall is calm, and it is easy
to see why this attitude is such a tremendous asset to (he temperament
of the players.
Friday night wo happened to run into Forrest Twogood after the game
end we put a few questions to him;
To the question of why he didn't ro out earlier to try to break up the
stull, Twogood replied, "1 didn't feel like it. What do you think of that?"
We tried rewording the question. This time we got: "I have my rights
don't I? You wanted to play ball oneway, I wanted to play another. How's
that for an answer?"
We asked him what the post-game row was between him and Stanford
trainer Connie Jarvis. He replied, "One guy was popping off so I went
for him."
Of course we had talked to u coach who had just lost a tough hall
game. The situation was a strained one, but we have talked to Boh
Burnett and other coaches after dropping toughies and we never got
anything quite like that.
Does SC Deliberately Foul?
Another question arises. Does SC deliberately foul? Alter watching
SC basketball for three years, it is my opinion and the opinion of many
others that they definitely do.
USC committed 70 fouls during the weekend, compared to the 39 by
Stanford. Etl Tucker and Ron Tomsic spent a great part of each evening
in the first row, in fact Tomsic was knocked groggy Friday and had to
leave the game. Also, why should such a normally calm player like Ram
stead suddenly lose his temper?
Another point to add. Just what is a player like Boh Morton doing on
a basketball court? The USC basketball brochure will tell you he is "big
and rugged and a pood shot." We'll agree with the first two. To look at
the charts we find that against Stanford during the weekend he took six

floor shots, mostly from in close,
and connected with one. Oh yes,
he collected a (otal of one rehound
in both nights. Just another litile
point. Why wouldn't Morion shake
hands when Tomsic offered (o after
Bob had bounced the little guard
into the second row?
Well, we could go on indefinitely
but I think (lie point is clear. We
here at Stanford .should be especially
thankful that we have a coach like
Burnett and players like Tucker,
Tomsic, and Ramstead to root for
instead of the likes of Twogood and
Morton.

The 1952 Stanford-USC basketball series is already history. During the

in Ihowever, Everett Dean introduced to Stanford a system that
lias made him one of the most highly-respected and best-loved men ever
to In l connected wi(h the game. II went a little deeper (han the actual
playing of the game; it was a way of life. The main thing it stressed was
that a basketball coach, or a coach in any sport has a tremendous re
sponsibility; not only to his school and to the boys he comes in contact
vvilh, but to the game itself.
It is up t:> that coach to try to interpret to (he best of his ability, the
spirit of the rules of, the game as well as the letter. II lie does his and then
abides by his decision, he is aiding the game itself and giving the players
he coaches a good illustration of the meaning of sportsmanship.
In other words, the main difference between the Barry and the Dean
system is that one system stresses winning the game, and the other, im
proving the game and training the players in good sportsmanship.
Ruriiell and Twogood dairying On
Rob Burnett has introduced new methods such as die two-platoon
system and the delayed offense, but the main coaching philosophy is the
came as that of Dean. There is no room for a dirty player on the Stan
ford team.
Another important illustration of the system is the fact that both on
and off the court, Bob Burnett is a gentleman. During a game, the Stanford
bench is a picture of (joi.se and calmness. A word ot encouragement here
and there, a comment or two; but there is none of the wildeyed hysterics
of Feerick or Foley; the cold muttering anger of Woolpert, or the Hollywood
dramatics of Twogood. Instead the coaching stall is calm, and it is easy
to see why this attitude is such a tremendous asset to (he temperament
of the players.
Friday night wo happened to run into Forrest Twogood after the game
end we put a few questions to him;
To the question of why he didn't ro out earlier to try to break up the
stull, Twogood replied, "1 didn't feel like it. What do you think of that?"
We tried rewording the question. This time we got: "I have my rights
don't I? You wanted to play ball oneway, I wanted to play another. How's
that for an answer?"
We asked him what the post-game row was between him and Stanford
trainer Connie Jarvis. He replied, "One guy was popping off so I went
for him."
Of course we had talked to u coach who had just lost a tough hall
game. The situation was a strained one, but we have talked to Boh
Burnett and other coaches after dropping toughies and we never got
anything quite like that.
Does SC Deliberately Foul?
Another question arises. Does SC deliberately foul? Alter watching
SC basketball for three years, it is my opinion and the opinion of many
others that they definitely do.
USC committed 70 fouls during the weekend, compared to the 39 by
Stanford. Etl Tucker and Ron Tomsic spent a great part of each evening
in the first row, in fact Tomsic was knocked groggy Friday and had to
leave the game. Also, why should such a normally calm player like Ram
stead suddenly lose his temper?
Another point to add. Just what is a player like Boh Morton doing on
a basketball court? The USC basketball brochure will tell you he is "big
and rugged and a pood shot." We'll agree with the first two. To look at
the charts we find that against Stanford during the weekend he took six

floor shots, mostly from in close,
and connected with one. Oh yes,
he collected a (otal of one rehound
in both nights. Just another litile
point. Why wouldn't Morion shake
hands when Tomsic offered (o after
Bob had bounced the little guard
into the second row?
Well, we could go on indefinitely
but I think (lie point is clear. We
here at Stanford .should be especially
thankful that we have a coach like
Burnett and players like Tucker,
Tomsic, and Ramstead to root for
instead of the likes of Twogood and
Morton.

The 1952 Stanford-USC basketball series is already history. During the
weekend, Stanford proved itself to be the better team, but aside lrom being
a contest between two teams, the games brought out a contest between two
distinct coaching systems.
In when Sam Barry took over at the helm of USC he introduced a
somewhat unique system of play; namely that in order to make up for
whatever the team lacked in ability, it should be extra-aggressive. The
rules of the game are flexible, and if a coach can take advantage of a
1-oorly-defined point, to aid hin cause, so much the better.
in Ihowever, Everett Dean introduced to Stanford a system that
lias made him one of the most highly-respected and best-loved men ever
