WASHINGTON â€” Gen. Douglas
Mac Arthur withdrew from two
Presidential primaries today amid
reports by Sen. Robert A. Taft's
supporters that the general per
sonlaly has assured Taft that he
favors him for President.
Mac Arthur took his name of! the
Presidential preference ballots in
Pennsylvania and Minnesota. As lie
has in other races, Mac Arthur said
his name had been entered "with
out consultation with me and with
out my approval."
Sen. Estes Kefauver (D., Tenn.),
avowed candidate for the Demo
cratic Presidential nomination, also
withdrew from his party's primary
in Minnesota. This left Sen. Hubert
H. Humphrey (P., Minn.) unop
posed as a "favorite son" candidate
on the Democratic ticket.
Many Republican politieos here
view Mac Arthur as a possible com
promise GOP Presidential nominee
in the event of a deadlock between
Taft and Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhow
er at the nomination convention
next July.
