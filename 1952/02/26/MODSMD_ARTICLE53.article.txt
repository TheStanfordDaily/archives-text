# Card Nine Wins Opener
## Cole, Murphy Lead Indians to 20-3 Massacre of Pittsburgh Pirate Rookies 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford's baseball team opened its season against the Pitts
burgh Pirate rookies yesterday, and they're still sweeping up the
remains of the Pirates.
For the record, the score was a footballish 20 to 3. Three touch
downs to a field goal. The Cards had had five games rained out,
and they let out all their pent-up*

energy in the five-run fourth inning i
and the 12-run eighth.
Spearheading the Indians in vic-
I tory were pitcher Bob Murphy and
center-fielder Dick Cole. Murphy,
right-handed junior from Burlin
game, retired after having hurled six
innings of no-run, two-hit ball. Cole,
shifted from third base to his
brother's old centerfield post, mus
cled out two triples and a double.
The Floodgates Opened
Pitcher Tom Hoffman of the Pirate
Rookies port-sided three innings of
no-hit ball, and then the flood gates
opened.
Cole initiated the whole mess by
slamming a triple into left-center.
Catcher Jack She-pai d, a marked man
as far as the majors are concerned,
shot a screamer past third to send
Cole rollicking home. Left fielder
Chuck Essegian walked and Dick
Corzine found his way to first on a
bunt down the third base line.
First baseman Hal Hennacy got life
on a fielder's choice which was the
cue for shortpatcher Warren Good
rich to chase Essegian and Corzine
home with a two-base blast to center.
Hennacy and Goodrich countered on
Murphy's squeeze, and when the dust
had lifted, the score was 5 to 0.
The poor man's Ralph Kiners and
Wally Westlakes climbed back into
contention in the seventh as they
reached Card pitcher Mike Acker for
two runs on a double and a walk.
Th ree More for Stanford
Whatever victory hopes the Rook
ies might have had were dissolved
in the seventh as Everett Dean's men
tacked on three more runs. Third
baseman Owen Powell, compact
i guard on the football team, looped
a single into center which center

fielder A 1 Haverty challenged and
missed. Powell, incidentally, picked
up three hits. Second baseman Art
Abrahamson moved to third on the
play, and both completed the cycle
on Cole's triple to center. The cen
terfielder from Yakima checked in on
Shepard's blooper to center.
The rest of the runs were tallied
in the action-packed eighth inning.
Twelve of the things wandered across
the plate as the result of seven hits,
four walks, and two errors.
Stanford will take the diamond
again today at 3:15 p.m. The opposi
tion is San Francisco State, and Rog
Osenbaugh and Phil Page will toe
the mound for the Indians.
