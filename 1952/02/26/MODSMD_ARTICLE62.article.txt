# 'U.S. Spirit Amazing'

### BARBARA TUERK 
An "interesting" job and an even
tual home in Time's "suburban
idyll" is the confident expectation
of most U.S. students, however they
may worry about the state of the
world.
Yet, to Olga AfanaciefT, ASSU
Exchange Scholar from the Institut
d'Etudes Politiques in Paris, this
simple faith in the future is the
most amazing thing about our
country.
'It's wonderful that hero there is
hope for youth; it's like breathing
again," Olga said; "we may criticize
your sheltered life sometimes, but
a secure environment gives the in
dividual a chance to develop his
own personality."
Trying to express the prevalent
pessimism of France and Germany.
Olga described the frustration and
lear that seizes college seniors, who
learn that after four hard-working,
penny-pinching years at the uni
versity their services are worth less
than those of most manual laborers.
Youth Sntfhhcd
The "desperate struggle" to attain
an education and thereby move up
ward in the stratified society seem
ingly fails, she said, as neither gov
ernment nor private industry shows
any interest in youth.
In France, she continued, no one
even dreams of success before 40
or 50. Further, few studont-i dare
make any constructive plans for the
future. One hears often, "In five
years the Soviets will be here." And
the students have no faith in the
ability of their nation to hold out
for even a short time.
As an example of this defeatism
Olga told of a panic in France two
years ago, when rumors of impend
ing Russian attack so terrified citi
zens that they quickly bought out
all the food in Paris.
Reasons for Pessimism
Olga cited many reasons for the
pessimism of French youth, but

traced it primarily to the occupa
tion, when the young people lo«t all
established values and all faith in
their country's strength. They re
ceived no encouragement from their
parents, already disillusioned by
the disastrous results of the First
World War and doubly beaten by
the Second.
"It is hard to build again," she
said, "when your family, like mine,
has been ruined twice, once in 1918
and again in 1939. It doesn't seem
worth the trouble."
"It is difficult, she continued, for
Americans to realize the feelings of
a nation looking backward to past
glory. The French arc now realiz
ing for the first time that they're no
longer a first - rate power. Many
young people react to this by emi
grating to the French colonies,
South America, or the British Com
monwealth, where they believe
they can build a life for themselves
without fear of eventual destruc
tion.

One of the most interesting re
sults of the disillusionment of the
past decade has been the popularity
of existentialism. Olga described
the philosophy, as expounded by
Sartre and Camus, as purely nega
tive, a modern nihilism offering no
solution for the world's dilemma.
The French students' interpreta
tion of this creed has been more ex
ternal than deep. "In fact, most of
them don't really understand what
it is," she said. As interpreted by
the students, existentialism mounts
up to our "Eat, drink, and be mer
ry, for tomorrow we die."
She laughed and added that the
most obvious effects of the move
ment seemed to be "wearing black
sweaters and black trousers or blue
jeans for men and long straight
hair for girls; living from noon till
3 a.m. in cafes and bars in the
Sainte Germaine quarter; and look
ing desperate, particularly when
jitterbugging."
