# Hanoi Assaulted
## 
### 
HANOI, Indo-Chinn, Feb. 2.1
French Union troops fought off fu
rious Communist - led assaults in
northern Indo - China tonight and
tightened a defense ring around
Hanoi in expectation of an all-out
rebel drive to seize the city.
Viet Minh rebel patrols, roving
within 20 miles of this provincial
capital, stepped up their activity
after sundown when darkness hid
them from French warplanes.
