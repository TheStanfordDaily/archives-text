We can see how Shake
speare's boyhood is speaking to
us across the footlights when we
see the Shakespeare ptay.
This is what Dr. Virgil K, Whit
aket, executive head of the De
partmerit of English, told last
night's Tuesday Evening Series
audience in Memorial Audito
rium.
"You have heard the saying that
the child is father to the man. I
believe that Shakespeare the hoy
might be the father to Shakespeare
the dramatist," said Dr. Whitaker.
Professor Whitaker has long been
a scholar of Shakespeare and other
Elizabethan literature. It was only
recently, however, that lie began
to make an intense study of Shake
speare s education to determine its
effect oti the plays.
In Elizabethan education empha
sis was placed on fundamental
| training in moral discipline. This
j training was accomplished by spe
! ' ific learning of religious doctrine,
by reading the Bible and using it
as the baMs for Latin leading and
I composition, an I by the use of
j maxims.
"Educators in Elizabethan times
trained men for life by stocking
their minds with tuccinct moral
j principles," explained Dr. Whita
-1 ker. "They would pick the proper
i moral maxims and apply them to
| tilings a' hand. Shakespeare
thought that way was taught to
| think that way. For him there were
I no gradations from virtue to vice;
J a person was eitliei bad or good."
In writing verse the average
schoolboy used cribs. He would
think nf appropriate statements and
maxims and weave his poem
around them. When Shakespeare
j wrote his plays, however, he would
j think out a prose dratt and then
I put it into verse.
j Dr. Whitaker said that Shake- ]
speare never studied mathematics j
beyond algebra, psychology, natu- '
ral sciences, or English history.
"The marvel of his early history
plays is not what Shakespeare did
| with what he did know but what
j be did with what lie didn't know,"
commented Dr. Whitaker.
He told how Shakespeare got a
lot of fun out of his schooling. He
and his schoolmates would try to
make jokes out of the material they
studied as do modern school chil
dren. Much of this joking shows
up in his plays.

j wrote his plays, however, he would
j think out a prose dratt and then
I put it into verse.
j Dr. Whitaker said that Shake- ]
speare never studied mathematics j

"The marvel of his early history
plays is not what Shakespeare did

j be did with what lie didn't know,"
commented Dr. Whitaker.
He told how Shakespeare got a
lot of fun out of his schooling. He
and his schoolmates would try to
make jokes out of the material they
studied as do modern school chil
dren. Much of this joking shows
up in his plays.

We can see how Shake
speare's boyhood is speaking to
us across the footlights when we
see the Shakespeare ptay.
This is what Dr. Virgil K, Whit
aket, executive head of the De
partmerit of English, told last
night's Tuesday Evening Series
audience in Memorial Audito
rium.
"You have heard the saying that
the child is father to the man. I
believe that Shakespeare the hoy
might be the father to Shakespeare
the dramatist," said Dr. Whitaker.
Professor Whitaker has long been
a scholar of Shakespeare and other
Elizabethan literature. It was only
recently, however, that lie began
to make an intense study of Shake
speare s education to determine its
effect oti the plays.
In Elizabethan education empha
sis was placed on fundamental
| training in moral discipline. This
j training was accomplished by spe
! ' ific learning of religious doctrine,
by reading the Bible and using it
as the baMs for Latin leading and
I composition, an I by the use of
j maxims.
"Educators in Elizabethan times
trained men for life by stocking
their minds with tuccinct moral
j principles," explained Dr. Whita
-1 ker. "They would pick the proper
i moral maxims and apply them to
| tilings a' hand. Shakespeare
thought that way was taught to
| think that way. For him there were
I no gradations from virtue to vice;
J a person was eitliei bad or good."
In writing verse the average
schoolboy used cribs. He would
think nf appropriate statements and
maxims and weave his poem
around them. When Shakespeare
j wrote his plays, however, he would
j think out a prose dratt and then
I put it into verse.
