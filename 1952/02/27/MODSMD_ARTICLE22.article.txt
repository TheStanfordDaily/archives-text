FARIS, Feb 25 (UP)—Franco may be forced to abandon all of
Northern Indo-China to the Viol Minh Reds as a result of disas
teroiio wook-md defeats, authoritative Trench sources admitted
privately today.
A decision to withdraw from the areas where Communist rebel

for r:es have jolted French union de
fenses would roll back the French
defence lines 250 miles to the south
to the narrow "waist" of the country
in Annam.
Fiivato sources said official quar

Communist world.
But the withdrawal to Annam,
in Central Indo-China, would give
the French a concentrated, 150-
mile-wide defense line in defen
siblc mountain ridges.
Official Government sources would
not speak for the record of such a
possible withdrawal But last week

French position
