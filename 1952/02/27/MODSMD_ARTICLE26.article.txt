was going to '.wing at me. So I grabbed lain by the
coat and pulled him ( lose so he couldn't do any
damage. lie was pulled off and led away and Stan
ford officials apologized "
That's what Twogood said. Now here's what hap
pened a explained by Jarvis and as witnessed by
iliose pit f-ill: Twogood (how'd he ever get a name
like thai'.') was tit to be tn cl aftei lite game. He hadn't

planned on Lis gorillas losing to Stanford. As hp
passed Jarvis, Connie said something to the effect of
"calm down," or "take it easy.' With which Twogood
grabbed Jarvis by the collar and threatened to blast,
him one. It was nothing new for Twogood, who, while
lie was coach at Idaho, started fights with his own
players, rival coaches, and otln i assorted enemies.
As far as Twogood's statement about Jarvis coming
up with his arms flailing is concerned, it ain't true.
For you see, Jarvis had a medical bag in one hand
and some wet towels in the other.
MATIIIAS CLOSE SHAVE UEI'T. Bob Mathias
received a surprise package in the mail tlie other
day. Il was an awaid from the Fal Razor blade Com
pany for "Close Shave of the Year." The handsome
plaque referred specifically to Mathias's 90 yard
touchdown run against Southern Cal. The Olympic
decathalon champ went to class looking sharp, feel
ing sharp, being sharp.
FORTY LOGES, PLEASE. So help me, he's in the
news again . . . Warren G. Wonka.
Not too long ago, a Stanford student wrote a nice
note to the Guild Theatre, asking the manager to re
serve forty loges. Accompanying the note was a fat
check signed by Warren (J. Wonka. Apparently, the
manager had never read the Chappie, and the 40
seats were roped off.
As far as I know, they're still roped off.
FUN STAN COM, ATTENTION. The fundamental
standard committee won't go for this, but a i lassies

quarter. The name of the course . . . Vulgar Latin.
