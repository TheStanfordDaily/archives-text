On I .el i j II t.i tit tudent' of Stanford University, we
propose flat Stanford and the Free University of
Berlin affiliate. A\ we see it, an affiliation would
rrutr Stanford Um.'ei ;ity »nd the free University of
Beilni into an active association and h How hip based
«.n mutual goodwill it [j« < t, and undei tanding. The
purpose of s.ueh an affiliation would be to develop
t'ireei relationships among students and faculty at
Berlin r;nd Stanford.
If seem only natural that our universities be affili
ated. In addition to out history of close friendship,
our unit ■■ i ■ iii< ar> drawn together on other grounds.
The love of freedom to study without dictation and
ooprt ion, the belief that through truth wo shall find

justice a;id freedom for mankind are common to both
of our universities.
This is well expressed in the spirit of our mottos:
"Die I„uft Der Freiheit Weht," and "Veritas, lustia,
Libertas." Upon their foundation Stanford and the j
Free University, individually and severally have
played significant roles toward enriching our world
community with a hive of peace, freedom, and
social justice.
By mutual effort our affiliation should overcome
cultural and political barriers and physical distance.
We shall sti ive together to realize the responsibility
of university communities to eaoh other and to the
world.
In order that our affiliation may be most effective,
we envisage the creation of a Free University of Ber
lin affiliation Committee within our Institute of In
ternational Relations. We believe thai our affiliation
may allow three distinct exchanges, namely:
1. STUDENT - FACULTY EXCHANGE,' involving
the exchange of professors and students including a
possible Junior year abroad and exchange of medical
internes, student correspondence exchange (pen pals),
reception and tours for visiting students, especially
during the summer.
2. THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION, which
might include the exchange of newspapers and peri
odicals published by each University, descriptive
papers on student life at both universities, (i.e. from
Stanford we could send papers on the Honor Code,
the Fundamental Standard, the Sponsor System; the
Pre-Reg Program; Keg Day; Stanford social life;
fraternities; dorm life; student government set up,
ExCom, Cardinals, Drives Com., lift. Foreign Scholar -
ship Committee, etc.; Bookstore; Cellar; classroom
procedure; the Stanford coed.)
Joint research by students and professors on an
academic level, material on political and social move
ments, and student opinion on national and inter
national affairs also.
:< THE EXCHANGE OF SPECIAL PROJECTS
might include art exhibits and displays on student
activities, debates by tape recording, conceits by
tape recording, exchange ol libraries, and movies on
student life. Our amateur radio operators might call
one another.
Our program is nol one which we may realize
in a short time, hut it provides a goal to work
toward W« would appreciate your suggestion with
regard to this program. We hoth understand thai
our affiliation involves no financial commitment.
The proposed exchanges shall he arranged from year
to year as t irciimstances allow.
Miss Hella Reglin can testify fhat the students at
Stanford have not proposed this affiliation light
heartedly or without careful consideration. We are
enthusiastic over the possibilities of strengthening our
bond of friendship between Stanford and the Free
University. We anxiously await your reply.
