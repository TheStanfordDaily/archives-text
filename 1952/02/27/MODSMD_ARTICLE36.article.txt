# ON OTHER CAMPUSES
## Polls Throughout Nation Scrutinize Honor Modes 
### JIM MADISON 
Wlule Stanford has been holding
a student poll to re-examine its
Honor Code, other campuses
around the country have given at
tention to various proposed and ex
isting honor systems.
A poll of the Associated College
Press, representing 51 colleges and
universities in the United States
both with and without honor codes,
found 36 in favor versus 15 opposed
to what is generally called the
"Honor System."
PIONEER University of Minne
sota is one of If'w .schools in the
country which have a functioning
honor code that antedates Stan
ford's, boasting an honor system in
continuous operation since Septem
ber 1915.
The code applies only t'j class
room quizzes and exams. The phi
losophy is that il would be difficult
to work the system oul for lab and
class work.
Minnesota holds polls every four
years, and the students have voted
almost unanimously for the reten
tion of the system.
FACULTY ORIENTATION At
the University of Virginia, every
student is indoctrinated in his hon
or code by a Lop faculty speaker
during pve-registration. After this
formal talk, the students engage in
question and discus ,ion seminars in
classroom-size gi oup ..

COLORADO A(.(.IKS The hon
or code proposed at Colorado AAM
features a method of reporting vio
lations in which the "third-person
responsibility" is less rigorously de
iined than at Stanford.
The proposed code states: "The
honor code does not compel stu
dents to report infractions. Condi
tions . . . involved in infractions
vary so widely . . . that the ques
tion ol reporting violations should
belong to the individual con
science."
DAR'I iVIOI 11{ a new code school
- An honor system lias been ap
proved lor Dartmouth by the fac

only the approval by vote of at least
three-lourths of the undergraduate
student body.
OREOON investigated Stanford —
An honor code committee is at
tempting to establish an honor sys

has secured much ol its information
an I philosophy from investigating
the Code functioning at Stanford.
