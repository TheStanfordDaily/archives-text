# PETE GROTHE
## Punts and Pitches 
### 
What with bodies, with muscles attached, flying at other bodies, with
muscles attached, in the Pavilion last weekend, we think this a good time
to depart from the bestiality of male sports and devote today's column to
the femmes.
And so, as the title of one of the comic mags says, "Calling All Girls."

Stanford has had four great wo
men athletes ... swimmers Marjorie
Gestring, Brenda Helser, Sharon
Geary, and skier Brynhild Gras
moen. Of the four, two are still at
Stanford. Sharon Geary is a soph
omore and B.ynhild Grasmoen a
junior.
Brynhild, the native of Madera
wiill (lie Sramlaiuivian moniker,
learned her skiing at Yoseinite,
and what she lias clone since she
1 ir.-1 put on a pair of hoards at the
a;,e of eight would li 11 a volume.

M.Mt ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE NUMEROUS
In the '<1H winter Olympics, Brynhild placed tenth in the special slalom
and twelfth in the downhill. This is fairly good when you consider that
she was competing against 00 other racers and that in both races she was
the first American skier. An American is rated good if he or she finishes
in the first M, because must of the Europeans learn to ski before they can
walk.
Here are n few of tall, dark-haired skier's accomplishments: first in the
slalom at Mt. Hose last Sunday; winner of the Alta Cup in 194G; winner
of the silver belt race at Sugar Bowl; fourth in the international Harriman
Cup laces; and winner of all Western Ski Association races in 1047.
Brynhild, like the proverbial cat, has nine lives, and three of them have
been used already.
While training for the '48 Olympics in St. Anton, Austria, she was skiing |
with George Hearst, son of the late William Randolph Hearst. The sun !
was shining brightly on the snow, and distances were hard to judge. I
Brynhild was "just about ready to take off for a jump when she noticed j
Hearst, who was no better a skier than he is a newspaperman, fall. Her I
first thought was that she .should take the jump anyway, but she noticed
his face was white as a sheet, so she turned back.
"Are you hurt, George?" she asked.
"No," he said, "but look where you would have jumped."
She saw the slope from n different angle now, and what she saw wasn't
conducive to a normal heart heat. Had llearst not taken a spill, she would
have jumped off into a sheer 500 foot drop.
If that wasn't, enough, the very next day she almost went over another
cliff. She was looking over a downhill course with Olympic skier George
McCumber. A thick fog hung in the air, and George and Brynhild lost
the directional (lags. Brynhild, just by hunch, suggested they turn to the
left. It was fortunate hunch, because she was told when she got back,
"It's lucky you turned. If you hadn't, you would have gone over a steep
cliff. We lose skiers there every year."
Whew! One other time, she came perilously close to death. While skiing
witli Andrea Mead to Zermatt, Switzerland, Brynhild came inches away
from a dangerous drop-off, again without knowing it. The visibility v/as
zero, and one of the other Olympic skiers later reported that while coming
down the slope it was the first time that he ever did a slow snowplow.
Another skier had been killed there recently.
There is just a touch of the impish in Brynhild, the philosophy major
who blazes down the hill at 60 miles per hour. Last weekend, at the Reno
Winter Carnival, in which she took first in the women's slalom, Alex
KoslofV of the Stanford ski team cracked into a tree and messed up a few
rilts. Naturally, lie couldn't compete, so Brynhild dressed like a hoy and
tried to take Kosloff's place.
It happened, however, that Brynhild, who was around when the Lord
passed out good looks, was selected Queen of the Carnival the night before.
Ami there was. a discrepancy between her shapely figure and Kosloff's. She
was discovered.
The girl with the Scandinavian name didn't try out for the Olympics
this year, partly because of an injured knee. But it won't surprise anyone
if Brynhild Grasmoen, the girl who laughs death in the face and who tries
to impersonate a man, goes right on winning ski championships.
SHARON GEARY A CINCH FOR OLYMPICS
We aren't going to devote as much space to Sharon Geary, because the
climax of the Sharon Geary story won't occur until this summer at
IU-lsinki, Finland, the site of the Olympics. We'll he hack at the Olympics,
and we have every reason to believe that we can write a successful finish
to this column next fall.
Torn Haynie, Stanford swim coach, said, "Sharon is almost a cinch to
make the Olympic team, and I think she has a darn good chance of taking |
first in the 100 meters free style. She may also place in the back stroke." !
Sharon, who always has that freshly-scrubbed look, took first in the I
1.00 meters free style in the Pan American games last year. Last summer
in Detroit, she took first in the same event in the U.S. Women's Champion
ships, doing it in a sizzling 1:07.6.
Haynie, who drills the long-limbed mermaid from Long Beach from
8:30 to 9:30 every morning, reports that Sharon is always cutting her time
down and that her possibilities are limitless.
While in Argentina at the Pan American games, she unintentionally
snubbed Dictator Juan Peron twice. At the beginning of the games, the
swimmers were supposed to look and smile at Peron as they filed in.
Sharon couldn't spot the Argentine major domo, and passed right by him
with her nose in the air. Then, one other time, she and some other Ameri
can swimmers were making a racket late at night in front of a big mansion.
A policeman ordered them to shush up, because the mansion happened to
be the dwelling place of Juan and spouse Evita.
As we said, the end of the Sharon Geary story will come after the j
Olympic games. The dark-haired soph, who right now can churn through
100 meters of water faster than any other American girl, by the end of
the summer may he doing it faster than any other girl in the world.
