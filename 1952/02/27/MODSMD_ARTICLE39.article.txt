# Indians Prep for Crucial
## 
### 
Bob Burnett sent his cagers
through a strenuous two-hour drill
yesterday—a drill which brought a
smile of satisfaction to the young
mentor's face.
Olie Suzdaleff impressed with his
smart floor play, and Ron Tomsic
was meshing shots from all angles.
Eddie Tucker showed the same
form that gave him 21 points in the
first half Saturday, and when he
wasn't making baskets, he was get
ting off some beautiful passes to
Jim Hamstead under the bucket.
A 1,0 looking good was George
Zaninovich, on the front end of the
fa;.t break, and Don Delong, with
some nice side court shots.
Stre :sed in the practice was the
defense for California, the fast
break, and much scrimmaging.
The two tiffs against Cal will end
the season for the Cards. If Stan
ford wins both its games and UCLA
loses one against USC, then Stan
ford will be in a tie for first. In
case of a tie against UCIjA, there
would be a one-game play-off at
We. twood.
The Indians will taper off gradu
ally the rest of the week. Friday's
game against the Bears will be held
up in Berkeley. On Satuiday the
Cards will come home to the Pa
vilion.


CARD BRAIN TRUST—Stanford basketball coaches Gus Cha
valas, Bob Burnett, and Jack O'Sullivan get ready for the Cal
series which could easily determine the Southern Division PCC
champ. The Cards play both weekends with the Bears. If Stan
ford wins both and USC takes at least one game from UCLA in
the Westwood gym, a tie would result. UCLA now has a 6-4
record; Stanford and Cal, 5-5; and USC, 4-6.
