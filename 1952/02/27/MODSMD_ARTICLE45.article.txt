# Swimmers Head Toward 'Greatest-Ever" Season
## 
### KEN HIRSCH 
Stanford's swimming team, per
ennial scourge of the Pacific Coast,
has thrown practice into high gear
in preparation for the national
championship meet to be held at
Princeton over spring vacation.
This year's team is the finest the
PCC has ever seen, but unfortu
nately for Stanford, both Ohio State
and Yale have also achieved their
finest teams this year. Dick Cleve
land in the freestyle sprints, Jack
Taylor in the backstroke, Ford
Konnu in the distance events, and
Bob Clotworthy in the diving look
strong enough to beat Yale's fine
i crew of middle distance and relay
! swimmers.
Stanford could conceivably sneak
into third place if they ca. come
through with a fine performance as
they did last year. Bob Frojen, sec
! ond-place winner in the breast
stroke sprint for Stanford last year,
! has his work cut out for him. There
are at least eight breaststrokers
, bunched around last year's win-
I ning time in this event.
Pete Cole has improved every
year, and has a good chance to
place in the distance races. Teamed
with Cole in the middle distances
will be Bob Thompson, also a place
winner in last year's meet.
Cur best chance for an individ
ual victory rests with freshman
backstroker Larry Heim, whom
Coach Tom Haynie calls the best
freshman prospect Stanford has
ever had. Heim will team up with

Frojen and a freestyler, possibly
soph Jim Gaughran, in the medley
relay.
Stanford should go undefeated
again in dual meets, and should also
win the PCC championships to be
held here in May. The best-ever
season gets under way with a meet
Friday against Cal Poly in the Stan
ford pools at 3:30.
