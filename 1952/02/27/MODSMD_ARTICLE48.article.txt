# Missionary Describes Red Tibet Life
## People Split By Rivalries 
### SUE WHEAT 
Dave and Betty Woodward
in the past seven years have had
their share of ice and snow, ban
dits, isolation, and the discom
forts of native Tibetan life. Liv
ing on the roof-top of the world
isn't easy, but it's fun, they say.
And they'll go back if the coun
try is ever opened again.
In l!M<i the Woodwards with their
two small children went into Tibet to
do missionary work. During their
live-year stay they had tho unique
opportunity ol observing the Com
munists in action — in short, they
watched the overrunning of Tibet
by the Chinese Red army.
Woodward now is jour
nalism at Stanford to prepare him
self for publishing literature in
<iu;uiti(,y for new literates in Asia.
People in India and southeastern
who are being taught to read
for the lirst time i.ve being offered
only Communist propaganda. The
need, Woodward feels, is for un
biased subject matter presented by
national writers in simple, news
paper style.
When describing the Communist
occupation of Tibet, Woodward
said, "it has followed the clyssic
Chinese pattern which comes in
three movements: (1) nodding the

head, (2) shaking the head, anc
(3) cutting the head ofT."

"The Communists first handled
the Tibetans with kid gloves," he
said, "but that period is already
over."
In a talk to tlx* public at the
Palo Alto Community Center
Monday night, Woodward
lined the historical background of
Tibet. In the past, he said, Tibet
lias been distinguished by its
ability to resist modern life and
to absorb encroaching peoples.
Its tight isolation excluded Wcsi
j erneivs and Western ideas. But
; today, as a result of the Commu
nist Chinese occupation, the re
served characteristics of the Ti
! bctans are disappearing.

Several factors contributed to the
"fall" of Tibet, according to Wood
ward. They are:
1. China has always had politi
cal control over the larger area
and the majority of people of
i met. Only the western section
of the country arount| the capital
city of Lhasa was far enough re
moved to retain its independence
as a "closed land."'
2. In Lhasa there have been
trade interests sympathetic to
China.
East-West rivalries and an
over - all clan spirit within the
country made unification against
a common foe almost impossible.
4. India and the Western na
tions remained silent in (be face
of Communist armies advancing
on Tibet.
The East-West rivalry among the
aggressive Tibetans has an interest
ing aspect. In the east of the coun
try rivalry takes on a feudal nature.
Fights arc open, frank, and undis
guised. In the west, however, the
Tibetans are noted for their po
litical intrigue. A killing in Lhasa
would be more apt to occur in the
form of a knifing in the back.
The Tibetans themselves, said
Woodward, are a "likeable, bois
terous" people. "When they conic
into town, they yell, shoot oft"
their guns, and wrestle in the
streets. You might call them the
'cowboys of Asia'." •
The Woodwards stayed in Tibet
as long as they could under the
Communist regime. Seeing, how
ever, that it would be impossible to
continue their work, they applied
for permission to leave. After sev
en months, it was granted. On their
way out, however, they were in
explicably stopped and held by the
Chinese Communists in a filthy inn
for two months.
This, said Woodward, was one
way of "discrediting foreigners in
the eyes of the people and making
them lose face before letting
them go. Yet they were too wise
to make martyrs of us,"' he added.
Even foreigners such as doctors
and teachers with something to of
fer to society are being forced to
leave, Woodward said. They are
simply carrying out the Communist
motto—"Destroy, then build." This,
Woodward explained, means "get
ting rid of all the past, including
foreigners."

over."
In a talk to tlx* public at the
Palo Alto Community Center
Monday night, Woodward
lined the historical background of
Tibet. In the past, he said, Tibet
lias been distinguished by its
ability to resist modern life and
to absorb encroaching peoples.
Its tight isolation excluded Wcsi
j erneivs and Western ideas. But
; today, as a result of the Commu
nist Chinese occupation, the re
served characteristics of the Ti
! bctans are disappearing.

Several factors contributed to the
"fall" of Tibet, according to Wood
ward. They are:
1. China has always had politi
cal control over the larger area
and the majority of people of
i met. Only the western section
of the country arount| the capital
city of Lhasa was far enough re
moved to retain its independence
as a "closed land."'
2. In Lhasa there have been
trade interests sympathetic to
China.
East-West rivalries and an
over - all clan spirit within the
country made unification against
a common foe almost impossible.
4. India and the Western na
tions remained silent in (be face
of Communist armies advancing
on Tibet.
The East-West rivalry among the
aggressive Tibetans has an interest
ing aspect. In the east of the coun
try rivalry takes on a feudal nature.
Fights arc open, frank, and undis
guised. In the west, however, the
Tibetans are noted for their po
litical intrigue. A killing in Lhasa
would be more apt to occur in the
form of a knifing in the back.
The Tibetans themselves, said
Woodward, are a "likeable, bois
terous" people. "When they conic
into town, they yell, shoot oft"
their guns, and wrestle in the
streets. You might call them the
'cowboys of Asia'." •
The Woodwards stayed in Tibet
as long as they could under the
Communist regime. Seeing, how
ever, that it would be impossible to
continue their work, they applied
for permission to leave. After sev
en months, it was granted. On their
way out, however, they were in
explicably stopped and held by the
Chinese Communists in a filthy inn
for two months.
This, said Woodward, was one
way of "discrediting foreigners in
the eyes of the people and making
them lose face before letting
them go. Yet they were too wise
to make martyrs of us,"' he added.
Even foreigners such as doctors
and teachers with something to of
fer to society are being forced to
leave, Woodward said. They are
simply carrying out the Communist
motto—"Destroy, then build." This,
Woodward explained, means "get
ting rid of all the past, including
foreigners."

Dave and Betty Woodward
in the past seven years have had

When describing the Communist
occupation of Tibet, Woodward
said, "it has followed the clyssic

Woodward, are a "likeable, bois

as long as they could under the

Chinese Communists in a filthy inn

This, said Woodward, was one
way of "discrediting foreigners in

them go. Yet they were too wise

foreigners."

Dave and Betty Woodward
in the past seven years have had
their share of ice and snow, ban
dits, isolation, and the discom
forts of native Tibetan life. Liv
ing on the roof-top of the world
isn't easy, but it's fun, they say.
And they'll go back if the coun
try is ever opened again.
In l!M<i the Woodwards with their
two small children went into Tibet to
do missionary work. During their
live-year stay they had tho unique
opportunity ol observing the Com
munists in action — in short, they
watched the overrunning of Tibet
by the Chinese Red army.
Woodward now is jour
nalism at Stanford to prepare him
self for publishing literature in
<iu;uiti(,y for new literates in Asia.
People in India and southeastern
who are being taught to read
for the lirst time i.ve being offered
only Communist propaganda. The
need, Woodward feels, is for un
biased subject matter presented by
national writers in simple, news
paper style.
When describing the Communist
occupation of Tibet, Woodward
said, "it has followed the clyssic
Chinese pattern which comes in
three movements: (1) nodding the

head, (2) shaking the head, anc
(3) cutting the head ofT."

"The Communists first handled
the Tibetans with kid gloves," he
said, "but that period is already
over."
In a talk to tlx* public at the
Palo Alto Community Center
Monday night, Woodward
lined the historical background of
Tibet. In the past, he said, Tibet
lias been distinguished by its
ability to resist modern life and
to absorb encroaching peoples.
Its tight isolation excluded Wcsi
j erneivs and Western ideas. But
; today, as a result of the Commu
nist Chinese occupation, the re
served characteristics of the Ti
! bctans are disappearing.

Several factors contributed to the
"fall" of Tibet, according to Wood
ward. They are:
1. China has always had politi
cal control over the larger area
and the majority of people of
i met. Only the western section
of the country arount| the capital
city of Lhasa was far enough re
moved to retain its independence
as a "closed land."'
2. In Lhasa there have been
trade interests sympathetic to
China.
East-West rivalries and an
over - all clan spirit within the
country made unification against
a common foe almost impossible.
4. India and the Western na
tions remained silent in (be face
of Communist armies advancing
on Tibet.
The East-West rivalry among the
aggressive Tibetans has an interest
ing aspect. In the east of the coun
try rivalry takes on a feudal nature.
Fights arc open, frank, and undis
guised. In the west, however, the
Tibetans are noted for their po
litical intrigue. A killing in Lhasa
would be more apt to occur in the
form of a knifing in the back.
The Tibetans themselves, said
Woodward, are a "likeable, bois
terous" people. "When they conic
into town, they yell, shoot oft"
their guns, and wrestle in the
streets. You might call them the
'cowboys of Asia'." •
