# Dr. Mosher Directs Research

### BOB WILSON 
The modern and tidy olfice in
the sparkingly now organic
chemistry building is scarcely
indicative of the complex woik
that is carried on within its walls
by its industrious occupant, Dr.
Harry S. Mosher, associate pro
fessor of chemistry. His day is
an extremely busy one, being
divided between conducting an
organic chemistry lecture and
supervising the activities of
graduate students working for
their masters and doctors do
grees in chemistry.
Many grad students in chemistry
under Dr. Mosher have received
grants from druy and chemical com
panies such as f'aike-Davi and Du-
Pont t(i carry on research in their
respective fields of chemistry.
A typical organic research proh-
Inn concerns itself with antibiotics,
such as Chloromycetin. This drug
is of special interest for several
reasons. Primaiily il contains nitro
compounds, which are all highly
poisonous and accordingly endow
it with the capacity to knock out
many disease producing micro-or
ganisms, which penicillin and oilier
wonder drugs will not harm.
One of the two Stanford research
projects connected with this drug
arises from its cheap synthesis;
this project is the endeavor of l>r.
Mosher and his students to find a
practical way to synthesize ana
logs of Chloromycetin, which give
promise of hring valuable in the
field of curative medicine.
Working under Parke -Davis grants
several students under the super
vision of Mosher are currently en
gaged in experimenting with varia
tions of the Chloromycetin molecule
in an effort to obtain some of these
useful analogs; however, they have
not yet met with success.
The other research project being
conducted with Chloromycetin is
llic attempt to make it soluble.
Itciug insoluble in water, it must
he taken orally. A drug to be
taken through the veins by in

jvetion must he soluble in order to
prevent its causing a Mood clot.
Due to the numerous advantages of
the latter type of administration,
the importance of this work is
readily understandable.
In these examples of research
work concerning Chloromycetin, as
in all other projects. Dr. Mosher,
like other chemistry professors,
serves as a supervisor to the grad
students, who actually carry out
the work. The professors have little
time except in the summer to work
in the lah themselves, and spend
their spare hours during the aca
demic year helping students out
with seemingly impassable prob
lems they have run up against.
A student working for a Master's
degree will have to spend one year
of research in the laboratory, and

one working foi a do<'tot,\ degree
must carry on a resoaieh project for
three years. Even at the end of this
j time, many projects remain as mys
terious as they were the day thai
work on them began
Therefore, Hi" typical profess m ot
i chemistry larely makes speotabulai
j discoveries. Rather, his job is con
cerned with helping the students in
J their projects and problems, and In .
reward, if any, seldom lakes the form
| of royalties from the invention of a
revolutionary plastic or drug prod
! uct.
Dr. Moshcr, as representative of
j such professors, is aware that his
satisfaction lies in his patient deal
! ings with current students who
someday may themselves contribute
' to the development of new products
and theories.

The modern and tidy olfice in
the sparkingly now organic
chemistry building is scarcely
indicative of the complex woik
that is carried on within its walls
by its industrious occupant, Dr.
Harry S. Mosher, associate pro
fessor of chemistry. His day is
an extremely busy one, being
divided between conducting an
organic chemistry lecture and
supervising the activities of
graduate students working for
their masters and doctors do
grees in chemistry.
Many grad students in chemistry
under Dr. Mosher have received
grants from druy and chemical com
panies such as f'aike-Davi and Du-
Pont t(i carry on research in their
respective fields of chemistry.
A typical organic research proh-
Inn concerns itself with antibiotics,
such as Chloromycetin. This drug
is of special interest for several
reasons. Primaiily il contains nitro
compounds, which are all highly
poisonous and accordingly endow
it with the capacity to knock out
many disease producing micro-or
ganisms, which penicillin and oilier
wonder drugs will not harm.
One of the two Stanford research
projects connected with this drug
arises from its cheap synthesis;
this project is the endeavor of l>r.
Mosher and his students to find a
practical way to synthesize ana
logs of Chloromycetin, which give
promise of hring valuable in the
field of curative medicine.
Working under Parke -Davis grants
several students under the super
vision of Mosher are currently en
gaged in experimenting with varia
tions of the Chloromycetin molecule
in an effort to obtain some of these
useful analogs; however, they have
not yet met with success.
The other research project being
conducted with Chloromycetin is
llic attempt to make it soluble.
Itciug insoluble in water, it must
he taken orally. A drug to be
taken through the veins by in

jvetion must he soluble in order to
prevent its causing a Mood clot.
Due to the numerous advantages of
the latter type of administration,
the importance of this work is
readily understandable.
In these examples of research
work concerning Chloromycetin, as
in all other projects. Dr. Mosher,
like other chemistry professors,
serves as a supervisor to the grad
students, who actually carry out
the work. The professors have little
time except in the summer to work
in the lah themselves, and spend
their spare hours during the aca
demic year helping students out
with seemingly impassable prob
lems they have run up against.
A student working for a Master's
degree will have to spend one year
of research in the laboratory, and

one working foi a do<'tot,\ degree
must carry on a resoaieh project for
three years. Even at the end of this
j time, many projects remain as mys
terious as they were the day thai
work on them began
Therefore, Hi" typical profess m ot
i chemistry larely makes speotabulai
j discoveries. Rather, his job is con
cerned with helping the students in
J their projects and problems, and In .
reward, if any, seldom lakes the form
| of royalties from the invention of a
revolutionary plastic or drug prod
! uct.
Dr. Moshcr, as representative of

satisfaction lies in his patient deal
! ings with current students who
someday may themselves contribute
