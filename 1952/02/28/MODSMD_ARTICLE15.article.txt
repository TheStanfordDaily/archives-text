# Foreign Study Plan Enlarged
## 
### 
The Foreign Scholarship program
will be expanded next year to bring
six men and two women to the
campus from foreign universities.
The eighth scholarship was made
possible by a gift received from
Mrs. E. M. Heller in honor of Lord
Halifax's visit here last fall, and
will be granted to an English stu
dent.
Thirteen fraternities will partici
pate in next year's program, along
with Toyon, Stern, Women's Row,
Lagunita, and Union Residence.
The houses included are: Alpha
Delt, Delta Chi, DU, SAE, Sigma
Chi, Phi Delt, KA, Deke, ATO, Phi
Kap, Theta Xi, Fiji, and Theta Chi.
Representatives of the living
groups will select their scholars at
two meetings scheduled for March
5 and March 12. Almost DO appli
cations had been received by the
Foreign Scholarship Committee
yesterday.
Phil Saeta and Dick Weinman, co
chairmen of the committee, are
completing the signing of the con
tracts this week.
