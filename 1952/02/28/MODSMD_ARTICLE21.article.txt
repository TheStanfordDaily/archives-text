# Lake Lag Boasts Unique History
## Leaks, Mules Featured in Busy Past 
### BOB BLACKBURN 
From the raucous shouts of
mule drivers to the twanging
strings ol ukuleles, the evolution
of Lake Lagunita has taken many
strange turns.
Lake Lagunita was originally in
tended as a water reservoir from
winch to irrigate the acres of al
falfa which used to grow where the
Quad now stands. Leland Stanford
brought in teams of mules and
scrapers to dig the reservoir.
Water was brought in then, as
now, from Searsville Lake, but a
serious fault was found, The bot
tom leaked! The .soil was of such
a porous nature that the impounded
water slowly drained out.
To counteract this, 2,000 head of
sheep were brought to the farm.
An impervious clay was spread
over the bottom. All day long the
herd was driven around the lake,
until the whole lake bottom had
been trampled by 8,000 hooves.
This stopped the leakage, and the
sediments brought in : oon formed
an effective plug. However, garden
lovers in the area soon discovered
that these soils were exceptionally
fine for their plants, and the run
was on. Finally, the point was
reached where even the clay was
being hauled away; so a halt was
called.
As soon as the University opened,

the students immediately acclaimed
las as the centei of spring quarter
activities. Canoeing and swimming
became popular.
In the fall of 1R32, a rumor was
spread that. Senatoi Stanford was
going to donate a sum of money to
send a crew to the World's Fair ir>
Chicago. Campus reaction was
swifl, and soon the forerunnej of
today's boa thou ;e was built, a $400
structure to house the crew and
shells.
The trip to the fair didn't mate
rialize, but the boathouse was built
thid the crew was launched.

their own boathouse in 1910. Until
19X4 twn boathouses graced the
shores beneath the pines of Las.
However, some disease attacked
these trees, and they had to be up
rooted and live oaks planted.
'I lie original boathouse was re
built, in the spring of 1913 for the
use of the crew, instead of housing
canoes, ii had facilities foi the stor

A firp in 1!)LM destroyed the worn
en's boathou e, and until 1.939 when
the present structure w.is built, only
the 1913 boathouse survived.
Student action for a new boat
house came to a peak in I9.''H when
one corner of the quarter-century
old structure collapsed during the
Water Carnival. No one was in
jured, but several students were
ducked. ,
