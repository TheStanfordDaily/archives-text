## 
### 
l.tc aii .p of vandalism the Library
may have (•> close the Resei ve Book j
Room at flic same time as there- j
mainder of the building instead of
leaving it open until 10 p.m. on Sat
urday.; and Sundays.
In recent weeks the circulation
files ol books loaned have been dis
turbed. On two occasions entire
drawers have been taken from the
card catalog, and returned anony
mously later.
Several day:, ago the door to the
Periodical Boom was broken open,
damaging the lock and hinges.
The • o t of maintaining a guard on
the second floor doubles the expense
of keeping tho Reserve Book Room 1
open <m Saturday and Sunday nights.
Unless students stay on the ground
floor earlier closing hours will have
to be imposed.
