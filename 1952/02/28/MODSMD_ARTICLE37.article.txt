# An Alumni Student Liaison
## 
### 
The Stanford Axe Society, which is holding
member;:!up Iryouts tomojrow, js a qood ex
ample of a worthwhile campus organization
with a leqitimale, lonq-absent function to per
form.
t he Society revised an oriqinally vague con
stitution and ha'j come up with some specific
function'":. Primarily, in its role as a liaison
group between students and alumni, the so
ciety will undertake, m conjunction with the
Alumni Association, hosting such projects as
the annual Spring Alumni Conference.
Alumni Director lack Shoup expects to work
rloseiy with the- organization in planning re
unions and other alumni affairs.
in th.-. past, the job oi helping out at alumni
at tans was toi ted on such organizations as
' 'aidmals and llally < 'om. which weren't par
ticularly interested or active in the work.
the Axe society has already biought for
v/ard some good suqqesticns lor alumni re
unions.

One is organizing reunions on the basis of
Jiving groups- li.iternities and eating clubs.
Another is reunions based on membership in
Stanford iioitGi hat« rnities and societies, where
a common occupational interest would be likely
to exist.
The Axe Society will also conduct guided
tours tor alums through new campus build
ings—.S'fern Hall, the Electronics Lab., and
others.
These are services difficult for the Alumni
Office to provide because of a lack of man
power. And it t;: unfair to request help from
student organizations designed basically for
other functions.
Such a liaison group as the Axe Society is
particularly desirable now—when undergradu
ate membership in the Alumni Association is
at an all-time high. Undergraduates have a ieal
stake and should have a real voice in the as
sociation's activities. The Axe Society can be
that voice.
