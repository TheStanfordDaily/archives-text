Here' a favorite daydream of
the autumn time when the smell
r,l football is stronger than the
scent ot burning leaves.
. . . It's the cfey before the Big
Game and tin whole campus r.

worried about the outcome ol the next day's contest.
(Pooi old Stanford hasn t had a red hot yeai and
plans to even Ihings up by whopping Cal. Wishful
thinking is running high but the expert*; nay, "Poor
' tinifoi'd )
Just by chance you happen to wander to the top
of Hoover Tower that day. It's a great afternoon and
you want, to tale .i look aiound and » h ai your head.
Ovei by the i ailing you see a big man crying and
leaning fat over the edge You rush over to him and
put a kind arm around his shoulder. "Don't jump,
*-ir. I' i an't L that bad. To youi surprise you find
it . the football coach.
' ! can't In lp it,"he wails. "Three of my halfbacks
were ; u Idenly poisoned today and I haven't got any
body to play left hall Please have me alone. This
is the L»— L way."
"Don't be discouraged, Chuck. 1 think I've got an
idea I played half in high school. (You remember
thosi fleeting moment' of gloi y i 1 was too light to
try out io collegt hut maybe I tan Kelp tomorrow,"
you tell him.
"I'm truly torched," Chuck says with a tear in his
eve, "that you should want to help I won't kill my
self. And what's more f'll even let you suit up to
morrow What size helmet do you wear?"
The next aftc noon you - it on the bench and watch
a valiant Stanford eleven battle a mighty Cal By

sheer courage the red and white stays in the contest.
Cal scores easily in the first three minutes ol play.
Stanford comes back to counter a tally. Back and
forth swings the pendulum of victory. And still on
the bench you sit.
There's one minute to play. Cal is ahead by five
points. The hated Blue and Gold are on the Stanford
ten yard line and punching forward. The last re
serve halfback is carried oH the field, 11is neck broken
You are (he only substitute lelt on the bench. Chuck
motions you into the game with a futile wave of his
hand.
Nov/ you're playing defensive half. Cal tries to
knife between guard and tackle. You smash up from
the tertiary to clobber the brute for no gain. In doing
so you ieel the bone in your nose shatter. (It's noth
ing you say as you set it yourself and wipe the blood
away.) On the next play Cal tries its famous end
sweep play. You dash up to stop it but the fullback
cuts inside of you. You reach out. a desperate hand.
You miss the man but grab something else. It's round
and egg shaped. .-What can it be?
You look down. Suddenly it dawns. You've got
the ball in ycui hand. Like a flash of lightening, like
a scared Mel Pat ton, like a chaste rabbit, like Red
Grange you thunder down the open field. Ninety
yards to a touchdown. People all ovei the stadium are
fainting. (Chuck included ) The gun sounds. Stan
ford wins. "Oh it really wasn't anything," you say
to the mob of reporters.
With minor modifications this fantasy will fit almost
any sport any time of the year. All it takes is
originality.
Time for just one more short daydream.
. . . It's the night of your 21st birthday. You are
celebrating and relaxing in one of the local bistros.
Tonight you are a Man.
A seedy-looking fellow booms up to you and grabs
your arm. "I've got you now, you sniveling minor.
I'm from the 8.0. E. Let's see your 1.D."
You regard him coolly over your cool drink. "Drop
dead," you say.
"I'll call a cop," lie thunders at you.
"Go ahead, Rollo," you answer.
"Gee whiz/.," he sulks, "I'll never fill my quota this
way." And sadly he shuffles oil. (On tliat day you
are indeed a Man.)
There are lots more favorite fantasies but no space.
(1 guess it's just as well > But why not try writing
a few ol your own. Semi them into pocket book
publishers. Look how well Mickey Spillane did.

Here' a favorite daydream of
the autumn time when the smell
r,l football is stronger than the
scent ot burning leaves.
. . . It's the cfey before the Big
Game and tin whole campus r.

worried about the outcome ol the next day's contest.
(Pooi old Stanford hasn t had a red hot yeai and
plans to even Ihings up by whopping Cal. Wishful
thinking is running high but the expert*; nay, "Poor
' tinifoi'd )
Just by chance you happen to wander to the top
of Hoover Tower that day. It's a great afternoon and
you want, to tale .i look aiound and » h ai your head.
Ovei by the i ailing you see a big man crying and
leaning fat over the edge You rush over to him and
put a kind arm around his shoulder. "Don't jump,
*-ir. I' i an't L that bad. To youi surprise you find
it . the football coach.
' ! can't In lp it,"he wails. "Three of my halfbacks
were ; u Idenly poisoned today and I haven't got any
body to play left hall Please have me alone. This
is the L»— L way."
"Don't be discouraged, Chuck. 1 think I've got an
idea I played half in high school. (You remember
thosi fleeting moment' of gloi y i 1 was too light to
try out io collegt hut maybe I tan Kelp tomorrow,"
you tell him.
"I'm truly torched," Chuck says with a tear in his
eve, "that you should want to help I won't kill my
self. And what's more f'll even let you suit up to
morrow What size helmet do you wear?"
The next aftc noon you - it on the bench and watch
a valiant Stanford eleven battle a mighty Cal By

sheer courage the red and white stays in the contest.
Cal scores easily in the first three minutes ol play.
Stanford comes back to counter a tally. Back and
forth swings the pendulum of victory. And still on
the bench you sit.
There's one minute to play. Cal is ahead by five
points. The hated Blue and Gold are on the Stanford
ten yard line and punching forward. The last re
serve halfback is carried oH the field, 11is neck broken
You are (he only substitute lelt on the bench. Chuck
motions you into the game with a futile wave of his
hand.
Nov/ you're playing defensive half. Cal tries to
knife between guard and tackle. You smash up from
the tertiary to clobber the brute for no gain. In doing
so you ieel the bone in your nose shatter. (It's noth
ing you say as you set it yourself and wipe the blood
away.) On the next play Cal tries its famous end
sweep play. You dash up to stop it but the fullback
cuts inside of you. You reach out. a desperate hand.
You miss the man but grab something else. It's round
and egg shaped. .-What can it be?
You look down. Suddenly it dawns. You've got
the ball in ycui hand. Like a flash of lightening, like
a scared Mel Pat ton, like a chaste rabbit, like Red
Grange you thunder down the open field. Ninety
yards to a touchdown. People all ovei the stadium are
fainting. (Chuck included ) The gun sounds. Stan
ford wins. "Oh it really wasn't anything," you say
to the mob of reporters.
With minor modifications this fantasy will fit almost
any sport any time of the year. All it takes is
originality.
Time for just one more short daydream.
. . . It's the night of your 21st birthday. You are
celebrating and relaxing in one of the local bistros.
Tonight you are a Man.
A seedy-looking fellow booms up to you and grabs
your arm. "I've got you now, you sniveling minor.
I'm from the 8.0. E. Let's see your 1.D."
You regard him coolly over your cool drink. "Drop
dead," you say.
"I'll call a cop," lie thunders at you.
"Go ahead, Rollo," you answer.
"Gee whiz/.," he sulks, "I'll never fill my quota this

dead," you say.
"I'll call a cop," lie thunders at you.
"Go ahead, Rollo," you answer.
"Gee whiz/.," he sulks, "I'll never fill my quota this

are indeed a Man.)

Here' a favorite daydream of
the autumn time when the smell
r,l football is stronger than the
scent ot burning leaves.
. . . It's the cfey before the Big
Game and tin whole campus r.

worried about the outcome ol the next day's contest.
(Pooi old Stanford hasn t had a red hot yeai and
plans to even Ihings up by whopping Cal. Wishful
thinking is running high but the expert*; nay, "Poor
' tinifoi'd )
Just by chance you happen to wander to the top
of Hoover Tower that day. It's a great afternoon and
you want, to tale .i look aiound and » h ai your head.
Ovei by the i ailing you see a big man crying and
leaning fat over the edge You rush over to him and
put a kind arm around his shoulder. "Don't jump,
*-ir. I' i an't L that bad. To youi surprise you find
it . the football coach.
' ! can't In lp it,"he wails. "Three of my halfbacks
were ; u Idenly poisoned today and I haven't got any
body to play left hall Please have me alone. This
is the L»— L way."
"Don't be discouraged, Chuck. 1 think I've got an
idea I played half in high school. (You remember
thosi fleeting moment' of gloi y i 1 was too light to
try out io collegt hut maybe I tan Kelp tomorrow,"
you tell him.
"I'm truly torched," Chuck says with a tear in his
eve, "that you should want to help I won't kill my
self. And what's more f'll even let you suit up to
morrow What size helmet do you wear?"
The next aftc noon you - it on the bench and watch
a valiant Stanford eleven battle a mighty Cal By

sheer courage the red and white stays in the contest.
Cal scores easily in the first three minutes ol play.
Stanford comes back to counter a tally. Back and
forth swings the pendulum of victory. And still on
the bench you sit.
There's one minute to play. Cal is ahead by five
points. The hated Blue and Gold are on the Stanford
ten yard line and punching forward. The last re
serve halfback is carried oH the field, 11is neck broken
You are (he only substitute lelt on the bench. Chuck
motions you into the game with a futile wave of his
hand.
Nov/ you're playing defensive half. Cal tries to
knife between guard and tackle. You smash up from
the tertiary to clobber the brute for no gain. In doing
so you ieel the bone in your nose shatter. (It's noth
ing you say as you set it yourself and wipe the blood
away.) On the next play Cal tries its famous end
sweep play. You dash up to stop it but the fullback
cuts inside of you. You reach out. a desperate hand.
You miss the man but grab something else. It's round
and egg shaped. .-What can it be?
You look down. Suddenly it dawns. You've got
the ball in ycui hand. Like a flash of lightening, like
a scared Mel Pat ton, like a chaste rabbit, like Red
Grange you thunder down the open field. Ninety
yards to a touchdown. People all ovei the stadium are
fainting. (Chuck included ) The gun sounds. Stan
ford wins. "Oh it really wasn't anything," you say
to the mob of reporters.
With minor modifications this fantasy will fit almost
any sport any time of the year. All it takes is
originality.
Time for just one more short daydream.
. . . It's the night of your 21st birthday. You are
celebrating and relaxing in one of the local bistros.
Tonight you are a Man.
A seedy-looking fellow booms up to you and grabs
your arm. "I've got you now, you sniveling minor.
I'm from the 8.0. E. Let's see your 1.D."
