## For a Referendum on Affiliation 
### 
To flip Editor:
It i: oui view that the letter to the Free University
of Eeilin which appeared in The Daily yesterday does
not i« present the opinion of all 'Stanford .Indents, a ;
it claims to do in the seventh paragraph "on behalf
of the student: of Stanford University,' and in the
hi t paragraph which talks of "the students of Stan
ford Univei ity proposing affiliation" and "we are
enthu; iastu ' From these quotations one must con
i lude that every Stanford student wishes to support
this affiliation.
Since v/e consider ourselves included as Stanford
students:
l V/e resent thp implication that all Stanford stu
dents favor (lie affiliation;
? We do not anil never have had the slightest in
tention of evei upporting : nch a move We do not
object to other individuals forming their own "I want
to help tin Free U. of HerJin Club," as long as they
refidin from dragging in the whole student body;
3. This proposal was serious enough to warrant a
student referendum in the first place;
■1 Therelore we feel that before Stanford gets too
involved in this matter the student body should have
an opportunity for reconsidering this affiliation by an
all-campus vote.
