# 'Superficial' Analysis'

To the Editor.
I have lead and read again Miss Olga Afanacieff's
interview and I a n still hoping that there have been
some mistakes in the way her interview has been in
terpreted
So far I was sure that all the foreign students
actually in the United States were trying to improve

then' human knowledge by picking up only what
seemed to be I lie m«v l constructive and the most
genuine idea:; of thi. country But nov/ J am getting
suspicious after having read this Olga's interview and
after knowing where the dangerous extrapolations
and the superficial analysis can lead when you are
speaking about the spirit of a nation.
You can build by induction a prehistoric animal
with a single vertebra, but you can't build (he United
States on the basis of Chicago's South Side, the Sing
Sheng case, or the marijuana problem. So you can't
expect to know the spirit of the French youth just
because you have seen a few crazy people, most r.f
them foreigners, making an exhibition in a Quartier
Latin cafe!
1 don't gn to Rossotti's to understand O'Neill or
Robert Frost, so 1 don't see the connect ion between
Sartre's or Catnus's philosophy and the way of liv
ing ni this international group who haunt the sopliL
firated cafes around Plaec Saint Geunain drs Pies.
Anyway 1 am very thankful for this interview. It
gives me an insight into French life that I never
understood before. Solar I luid the false feeling that
niv confident expectation was an "interesting job" and
a "home." Could you imagine that? Me, a "pessi
mistic," a "disillusioned," a guy "he is always looking
backwards with nostalgia to his old glory" having the
same expectation of the citizens of a country where
"there is always a wonderful hope for youth." Now
I know that my hope is only a pair of "black trousers"
and a pseudu existentialism <d the "Cafe du Com
mene." 1 thank you : incerely, Olga.
