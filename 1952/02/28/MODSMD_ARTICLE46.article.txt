# 'Rasho-mon' Rated Highly
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
Of extraordinary interest to
the moviegoer is a film entitled
"Rasho mon," a Japanese import
with English titles, currently en
trenched in San Francisco's
| Stage Door Theater for what ap
j pc-ars to be a long and well de
served run.
Beating out. all American and Eu
rojjean competition to win last Oc
tober's Venice Film Festival award
for best picture of the year, it has
created a sensation wherever it has
been shown except, interestingly,
in its honje country.
The fact is that the theory on
which "Rasho-mon' 1 is based that

truth is prima
rily in the eye
ol the bt'lr 'idei
- is not quite so
original or world
shaking as it e
made out to be.
Time immemo
rial has accept
ed the ai count

! of the disinterested onlooker over
those of the parties involved.
Nevertheless, the picture talie
tl.is human tendency to recount a
! series of events in such a way as
| to insure one's own moral integrity
anil turns it into a powerful, lath
: er frightening commentary on man
egoism and weaknes
Much after the fashion c,f the n n w
Italian school ol film , "J{a ho-inon
| follows a single story - line, un
complicated by sub-plots, and pro
ceeds m a straightlorward mamvr.
The tale is simple: a man and hi'
! young wife are accosted in the lur
j est by a primitive bandit, who sub -
sequently rape, the girl. This mu.:h
is established.
The mystery is the death of the
husband. The bandit claims lie was
I the murderer. The wife implies that

the was. And the dead man, through
a medium, insists that he killed
himself.
The ironically undramatic facts
ol what really happened we finally
learn from a firewood dealer, the
di interested beholder, who wit
nessed the whole affair.
'J ho at tim!, on the whole, is su
perior. 'losluro Mifune creates a
truly immutable, not to say as
tounding, characterization of Tajo
mai u the bandit.
As the wife, Michiko l<yo is also
excellent, although, unfortunately,
lu r excessive weeping becomes
somewhat of a trial before the pic
ture ends.
Only Masayuki Mori is disap
pointing. He plays the husband wilh
i scowling disdain which is at once
banal and irritating.
Din-dor Akira Kurosawa, faced
with the problem of telling approx
imately the : ame story four times

without Ie coming a bore, executes
this feat with remarkable kill.
Mechanically, too, the picture is
outstanding, and Hollywood, gen
erally acknowledged the world's
master at twis tort of # thing, had
better look to it; technician: .
"Rasho-nion" has iiune or the dif
ficulties of poor lighting or faulty
otind mechanisms which often dis
tract frcm foreign films, however
v.ood tliey may otherwise be.
