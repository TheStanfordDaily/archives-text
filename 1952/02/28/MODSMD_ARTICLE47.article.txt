Today we change our course and take up the subject of track. No, we
do feel (hat a change of pace is needed ones in a while. And the first track
meet is just around the far turn, so to speak.
Let us first say that the Indians will be good if for no other reason than
Stanford is blessed with one Robert Mathias." True, that he is only oih

man, but track is a sport where one
good man can be a big help. Track
is not a team sport in the strictist
sense of the word. And Bob will
make Stanford a tetter than average
team all by himself.
The Cards are hard hit by the loss
of several important cogs. Ronny
Buck, sprinter; Cass Dly, 440 man;
Darrell Kreitz, a top high hurdler;
Joss Scroggy, middle distance man;
Lew Davis, shotputter; Merritt Van
Sant, a good broad jumper and
George Van ITeuseri, pole valuter,
are all lost through graduation.
Norm Jiles, one of the top high jump
ers on the Coast has dropped out of
school.
But all is not dispair, not by a
long way. For now, registered at the
Admissions office are some fine track
men from junior colleges and several
high school fiosh who this year are
eligible to compete in varsity com
petition.
There are three JC transfers
worthy of note. In the javelin
throw is one Leo Long, who com
peted for Modesto JC and won the
Modesto Relays in Itis division with
;i ill' '>(I*l foe I f<"rom (■

JC liails YVilford King who runs both (lie mile and (wo mile. King lias
vim a !) :!iJ 7 (wo mile while going (he lour lap per in 4::iO. And finally
among (lie transfers is Howard Hertz from IYII. San Antonio JC. liig
liowie, who only weighs 2515 Ihs., has heaved the shot 51 feet and is close
to that with most of his tosses. He is currently learning the rudiments
of the discus under head track coach Jack Weiershauser.
From the prep ranks come distance man Robert Reed from Estacada
High in Oregon and Bob Kimball from Andover Prep school in Massa
chusetts Kimball is a javelin heaver and throws the lethal weapon right
around the 195 ft. mark. Coupled with Long, Stanford should have two
added point makers in the javelin toss.
Reed, the 18-year-old milc-r and two rhiler, is one of the hardest work
ers on the club. Already Reed has forced Bob Simon to press to remain
top pin. Reed has run a 4:25 mile. In the two mile he is down to 9:54.
In the way of help coming up from below are Fred George and Don
Carlson. George took the 440 in last year's little big meet with California
in 49.4. Carlson has thrown the shot 48 ft. and is coming along. Gerry
Wood, another soph, is right around 14.7 in the high hurdles. Dave
Fletcher, up from the frosh is a good half miler.
Those are the new men. Old-timers such as Will Taylor, Maury Pur
sons, Chuck Hoknnson, lan Reed, Chuck Renfro, and many more returning
veterans from last year's squad will provide the backbone for this 1952
track team.
Add to this Mr. Mathias and you come out with a well rounded and
potentially line cinder squad. Mathias is completely cured of all injuries
resulting Irom football. To date the decathlon champion has turned in
better performances in five events than any of liis teammates. In hurdles,
broad himp, pole vault, and discus. Mathias has excelled. He is right
up there in the shotput and high jump. This is the year of the Olympics
and Mathias is desirious of entering as much competition as possible he
fore defending his decathlon title come summer. So look for Bob to he
a mighty busy !ad this track season.
As usual USC ppears to be the top team in the nation as well as on the
Coast. But Stanford will give all opponents a tough battle in all dual meets,
following are the current leaders and marks in their various events:
Mile run: Bob Simon 4:21.2; two miles: Bob Simon 9:19; 880: Drew Ter
ramorse 1:50.5; 440: Will Taylor 48.(5: 100: Maury Parsons 9.7; 220: Maury

added point makers in the javelin toss.
Reed, the 18-year-old milc-r and two rhiler, is one of the hardest work
ers on the club. Already Reed has forced Bob Simon to press to remain
top pin. Reed has run a 4:25 mile. In the two mile he is down to 9:54.
In the way of help coming up from below are Fred George and Don
Carlson. George took the 440 in last year's little big meet with California
in 49.4. Carlson has thrown the shot 48 ft. and is coming along. Gerry
Wood, another soph, is right around 14.7 in the high hurdles. Dave
Fletcher, up from the frosh is a good half miler.
Those are the new men. Old-timers such as Will Taylor, Maury Pur
sons, Chuck Hoknnson, lan Reed, Chuck Renfro, and many more returning
veterans from last year's squad will provide the backbone for this 1952
track team.
Add to this Mr. Mathias and you come out with a well rounded and
potentially line cinder squad. Mathias is completely cured of all injuries
resulting Irom football. To date the decathlon champion has turned in
better performances in five events than any of liis teammates. In hurdles,
broad himp, pole vault, and discus. Mathias has excelled. He is right
up there in the shotput and high jump. This is the year of the Olympics
and Mathias is desirious of entering as much competition as possible he
fore defending his decathlon title come summer. So look for Bob to he
a mighty busy !ad this track season.
As usual USC ppears to be the top team in the nation as well as on the
Coast. But Stanford will give all opponents a tough battle in all dual meets,
following are the current leaders and marks in their various events:
Mile run: Bob Simon 4:21.2; two miles: Bob Simon 9:19; 880: Drew Ter
ramorse 1:50.5; 440: Will Taylor 48.(5: 100: Maury Parsons 9.7; 220: Maury

Today we change our course and take up the subject of track. No, we
do feel (hat a change of pace is needed ones in a while. And the first track
meet is just around the far turn, so to speak.
Let us first say that the Indians will be good if for no other reason than
Stanford is blessed with one Robert Mathias." True, that he is only oih

man, but track is a sport where one
good man can be a big help. Track
is not a team sport in the strictist
sense of the word. And Bob will
make Stanford a tetter than average
team all by himself.
The Cards are hard hit by the loss
of several important cogs. Ronny
Buck, sprinter; Cass Dly, 440 man;
Darrell Kreitz, a top high hurdler;
Joss Scroggy, middle distance man;
Lew Davis, shotputter; Merritt Van
Sant, a good broad jumper and
George Van ITeuseri, pole valuter,
are all lost through graduation.
Norm Jiles, one of the top high jump
ers on the Coast has dropped out of
school.
But all is not dispair, not by a
long way. For now, registered at the
Admissions office are some fine track
men from junior colleges and several
high school fiosh who this year are
eligible to compete in varsity com

There are three JC transfers

Today we change our course and take up the subject of track. No, we
do feel (hat a change of pace is needed ones in a while. And the first track
meet is just around the far turn, so to speak.
Let us first say that the Indians will be good if for no other reason than
Stanford is blessed with one Robert Mathias." True, that he is only oih

man, but track is a sport where one
good man can be a big help. Track
is not a team sport in the strictist
sense of the word. And Bob will
make Stanford a tetter than average
team all by himself.
The Cards are hard hit by the loss
of several important cogs. Ronny
Buck, sprinter; Cass Dly, 440 man;
Darrell Kreitz, a top high hurdler;
Joss Scroggy, middle distance man;
Lew Davis, shotputter; Merritt Van
Sant, a good broad jumper and
George Van ITeuseri, pole valuter,
are all lost through graduation.
Norm Jiles, one of the top high jump
ers on the Coast has dropped out of
school.
But all is not dispair, not by a
long way. For now, registered at the
Admissions office are some fine track
men from junior colleges and several
high school fiosh who this year are
eligible to compete in varsity com
petition.
There are three JC transfers
worthy of note. In the javelin
throw is one Leo Long, who com
peted for Modesto JC and won the
Modesto Relays in Itis division with
;i ill' '>(I*l foe I f<"rom (■

a loss 01 zwi icci. r mm «rienuaie
JC liails YVilford King who runs both (lie mile and (wo mile. King lias
vim a !) :!iJ 7 (wo mile while going (he lour lap per in 4::iO. And finally
among (lie transfers is Howard Hertz from IYII. San Antonio JC. liig
liowie, who only weighs 2515 Ihs., has heaved the shot 51 feet and is close
to that with most of his tosses. He is currently learning the rudiments
of the discus under head track coach Jack Weiershauser.
From the prep ranks come distance man Robert Reed from Estacada
High in Oregon and Bob Kimball from Andover Prep school in Massa
chusetts Kimball is a javelin heaver and throws the lethal weapon right
around the 195 ft. mark. Coupled with Long, Stanford should have two
added point makers in the javelin toss.
Reed, the 18-year-old milc-r and two rhiler, is one of the hardest work
ers on the club. Already Reed has forced Bob Simon to press to remain
top pin. Reed has run a 4:25 mile. In the two mile he is down to 9:54.
In the way of help coming up from below are Fred George and Don
Carlson. George took the 440 in last year's little big meet with California
in 49.4. Carlson has thrown the shot 48 ft. and is coming along. Gerry
Wood, another soph, is right around 14.7 in the high hurdles. Dave
Fletcher, up from the frosh is a good half miler.
Those are the new men. Old-timers such as Will Taylor, Maury Pur
sons, Chuck Hoknnson, lan Reed, Chuck Renfro, and many more returning
veterans from last year's squad will provide the backbone for this 1952
track team.
Add to this Mr. Mathias and you come out with a well rounded and
potentially line cinder squad. Mathias is completely cured of all injuries
resulting Irom football. To date the decathlon champion has turned in
better performances in five events than any of liis teammates. In hurdles,
broad himp, pole vault, and discus. Mathias has excelled. He is right
up there in the shotput and high jump. This is the year of the Olympics
and Mathias is desirious of entering as much competition as possible he
fore defending his decathlon title come summer. So look for Bob to he
a mighty busy !ad this track season.
As usual USC ppears to be the top team in the nation as well as on the
Coast. But Stanford will give all opponents a tough battle in all dual meets,
following are the current leaders and marks in their various events:
Mile run: Bob Simon 4:21.2; two miles: Bob Simon 9:19; 880: Drew Ter
ramorse 1:50.5; 440: Will Taylor 48.(5: 100: Maury Parsons 9.7; 220: Maury
Parsons 21 7; 120 highs: Bob Mathias 14.5; 220 lows: Bob Mathias 2.'1.4;
