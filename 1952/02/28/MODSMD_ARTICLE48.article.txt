### 
A hard-fighting Card polo team
staved oil a last-half rally to de
feat Central Valley (i-5 in a first
round of the Santa Barbara Eight-
Goal Tournament, played at
Fleischman Field in Santa Barbara
last Saturday.
Spotting the Valley quartet tliree
joals as a handicap, Stanford
chalked up a five-goal lead during
the fir. t half, only to see the margin
thaved to a single taliy before the
finish. A di advantage hampering
the Cards dining the final three
chukkers was the loss of horses due
to injuries, forcing the ur.e of tlnee
ponies for an extra chukker.
Stanford will play a semi-finals
contest on the same field this Sat
urday.
