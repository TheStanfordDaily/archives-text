# JV Baseballers Face Mission High
## 
### 
Stanford's baseball Braves will
be looking for their first victory of
the season this afternoon when they
tackle the Mission High Bears on
the frosh diamond at 3:15.
On Tuesday the jayvees lost their
first game to San Mateo JC by a
score of 4 to 2. The Braves gave
away four early runs on errors and
the pitcher's wildness and despite
a home run with one on by left
fielder Bill Schiedecker and loading
up the bases in the last of the
eighth, they could not push across
any more tallies.
Coach Dick Clegg is not too sure
whom he will send to the mound
today, but probably slated for ac
tion are Dave Freeman and Ray
Highsmith. Pitching the best ball in
the opener was righty Ron Boyer
who hurled the last three innings,
giving up only one hit and fanning
three.
