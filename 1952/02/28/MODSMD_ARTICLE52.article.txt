## LAST CHANCE Braves Out To Avenge Cal Losses 
### MIKE HUDSON 
Stanford's red-hot JV's will be
gunning for revenge when they
me't the veteran Cal Blue club in
the preliminary games of this
week's Cal series.
The Blues handed the Braves two ;
oT their five defeats, but since their j
la t meeting, the Braves have
mowed down 13 straight foes, most
of them by a: tronomical scores. The
team's overall record is 1G and 5.
Couch Gus Chavalas is the first to
admit an improvement. He is espe
cially proud of the way his boys
have mastered a tricky new defense j
that they will unveil against Cal.
Cal Coach Nibs Price is liable to
start any five of his veteran squad
against the Braves. Last time. Price
■ larled A! Horan against the Braves
one week and then against the SC
varsity the next. Tom Greenleaf,
the Bears' first-string guard, will
probably start against the Braves as
he is seholastically ineligible for
varsity competition. Diek Tarn berg,
Clay Gray, Bob Froeshle, Frank
Hoaglund, Bob Albo, Ed Lippstreu,
or Ray Moser will all either start
for the Blues or play second string
for the varsity. Nibs likes to play
it loose.
Stanford will try to run Cal's big
ger, older, and slower crew off the
court. Key man lor the Braves will
be hook-shooting Russ Lawler who
is the Braves' main hope to handle
the backboards against the beefy
Bears. Lawler is 6 ft. 7 in. and a
spectac uI ar prospect.
Howard Schwartz and Rick Car
ver will open at forwards. Both are
about G ft. 1 in. and good shots, j
Opening at guards will be Jim |
Johnson and Wayne Lockhart, a
pair of hectic hustlers who are the i
wheels under Stanford's fast break.
In listing future varsity material, |
Chavalas of course put Lawler on
top of the list. Lawler will probably
start for the varsity next year. Cha
valas next lists the 5-ft. 9-in. Lock
hart, Johnson, who scored 40 points !
in last week's games, and Schwartz,
a good rough player. Jim West
phal, should develop into a star in
two years, Chavalas prophesies. In
addition, players like Rick Carver,
George Caras, and many others
could easily come through. The
Braves are a strong, well-balanced
team.
