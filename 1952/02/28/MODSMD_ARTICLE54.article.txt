## 
### 
By JIM MADISON
Stanford has been forced to can
cel its remaining boxing match,
originally scheduled with Santa
Clara tomorrow night in the Pa
vilion.
Repeated manpower losses have
sunk the Cards' hopes oi fielding a
team tomorrow. The culminating
blow came when IGS - pound star
Bob Baldocchi broke his left thumb
in decisioning his opponent in the
first Santa Clara match a week ago.
Further, Tony Wynn, who has
fought at both IGS and 173 pounds,
has not returned to prime shape
after spraining both his thumbs in
the UCLA match.
Earlier, a variety of reasons had
forced Bobby White, Eric Hansen,
Bill McMuhon, Herb Cohen, and
such pre-season contenders as Bill
Millington, Bob Nunez, and Bob
Pallies to the sidelines.
Even though the Cards lost all
their matches, Coach Ray Lunny
declares thoy have shown well,
providing many good fights in spite
of their inexperience.
He bemoans the fact that Bal
docchi will not be able to box in
the Pacific Coast Championships.
Even if Bob's thumb should heal,
finals still conflict.
Lunny contends that Baldocchi
would have had a good chance of
carrying off the Coast crown in the
165-pound class.

The Card ringmen at this early
writing look as though they will
fare better next year. The most
outstanding of Lunny's green crew,
including Gary Sievert, Wynn, and
Baldocchi, will return.
In addition Lunny's elementary
boxing classes, which he was able to
resume only last fall on his return
from naval ciuty, .should begin to
pay off.
