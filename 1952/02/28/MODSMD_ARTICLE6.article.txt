BONN, Germany â€” U.S. High
Commissioner John J. McCloy said
today that growth of neo-Nazism is
a constant "potential danger" in
Germany and warned a prolonged
revival of extreme German nation
alism would ultimately lead to
"general disaster."
McCloy said the extreme right
does not constitute an immediate
threat to the West German Repub
lic. But, he charged that most es
tablished German political parties
have been "stocking the merchan
dise of nationalism."
Even some German cabinet min
ister.;, he said, have expressed high
ly nationalistic sentiments "either
out of conviction o; as a vote-get
ting device."
McCloy warned that existing neo-
Nazi organizations in Germany
might expand in the future "in a
suitable political climate."
