# 'Don't Make India Pawn,' Advises Talbot
## Asian Renaissance Described 
### HOLBROOK TETER 
j ' India doesn't want to he taken
| for granted and doesn't want to be
i used as a pawn in the big game
j between Russia and the We: t," said
j Phillips Talbot in an interview with
The Daily yesterday. And she is
afraid that the Westerners are try
i in;g to do just this.
Talbot, a representative of the
1 American Universities Field Staff,
| is on campus this week giving lec
tures to seminars, classes, and stu
! dent groups. A student of Indian
! affairs, he has worked in India for
the Navy, for the Institute of Cur
j rent World Affairs, and as a foreign
! correspondent lor uie Chicago Daily
j News.
"The present Indian leadership,"
he said, "is struggling to achieve a
1 ; table state, primarily through
[ democratic means." But there arc
| many difficulties in the way, such
| as the great economic problems,
troubles with Pakistan, and the ob
structionist policies of the Commu
nist party.
Talbot expressed surprise "at how
well the voting proceeded (in the
recent elections) in spite of the high
rate of illiteracy" to be found in the

i nation. "The sharp native shrewd
ness" of the people helped them in
the balloting.
Some intellectuals are afraid,
though, that the broad ba e of the
franchise may become a disadvan
tage if the economic situation is not
improved before the next elections.
Moslems, India's largest minor
ity, in many areas voted for the
Congress party, believing that its
leader, Prime Minister Nehru, will
protect them, Talbot said. Else
i where, however, they elected mem
: bers of their own religion to the
legislature.
In regard to Indian-American re
lations, Talbot said that the Indians
I find it hard to understand our
wealth, just as Americans find it
hard to understand Indian poverty.
They are also perplexed by our
global approach to world affairs,
just as we find it difficult to com
prehend the Indian emphasis on
their relations with Southeast Asia.
India is greatly interested in the
"renaissance of Asia," Talbot con
tinued, and feels that "Asia has an
important sell-directed role to play
in the world." This role is more
than cultural, and for this reason
India considers important its rela
tions with other Southeast Asian
nations.
The American Universities Field
Staff, of which Dr. J. E. Wallace
Sterling is vice - chairman of the
board of directors, is an association
of eight universities and colleges.
I Cal Tech, the University of Wash

ington, Tulane, the University of
Kansas, Carlton College, Brown
University, and Harvard Business
School are members, in addition to
Stanford.
The three-month-old association
maintains a staff of men living and
working in foreign countries. These
study and write on the problems of
the area, and then return to the
United States to lecture on their
first-hand experience. Stanford has
had four staff members visit its
campus this year.
