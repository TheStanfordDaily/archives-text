# Psych 51 Slated For Evaluation
## 
### 
If you have taken Psych 51 and
have a contribution to make to an
analysis uf the course, you will iiave
a chance to make your opinions
known next week, when the Stu
dent-Faculty Education Commission
begins a study of the Lower Division
Soical Science requirements.
The conference on Psych 51 will
be held Tuesday afternoon. Anyone
wishing to attend is asked to contact
Dianne Catlin at Lagunita Court.
Philosophy 1, 2, and 5 will be dis
cussed March 7. The elementary
courses in political science, econom
ics, sociology, anthropology, and
geography will come before the com
mittee next quarter.
Aim of the social science require
ment study is both to evaluate the
courses themselves and to "con
sider the value of those courses in
other fields and their basic contri
bution to the general education of
the student," according to Ihc com
mittee.
The discussions will be held as
round tables between faculty mem
bers and students who have taken
the courses being considered. "We
are anxious to locate students who
are interested in improving general
education at Stanford, Miss Catlin
explained. ''Since we want to obtain
the widest cross-section of student
criticism and opinion, these discus
sions are open to students with any
major no matter when they took the
coursc."
