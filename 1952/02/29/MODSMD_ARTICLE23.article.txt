will either become a irality or be proven just another dream
when Stanford and Cal square off tonight and tomorrow.
Bob Burnett's men of bounce meet Nibs Price's Bears tonight
c>t 0.30 in the Berkeley Gym. The same two squads end the regular

1 lar season at 8 p.m. tomorrow in the
Stanford matchbox.
A week ago today, the Indians
were the sole occupants of tlie
Conference cellar. Bv 10 p.m. to
morrow. by the grace of Clod and
the CSC Trojans, thev may l>e
tiie Southern Division title hold
ers. It's a large order, hut if
Stanford could effect a double v\in
and the Tro'ans could do like
wise if would be a classic in rags
to-riches talec.
If Stanford win* both games and
UCLA does likewise, the champion
ship would be the Bruins'. If UCLA,
which stands at the top of the heaji
with a six-and-four record, splits
and the Indians win both, then
Stanford and the Westwooders
would be tied. A sudden - death
play-off, most likely in Los Ange
les on Monday, would decide who
would meet Washington for the
PCC title. If Stanford split,; and
USC wins both (which is not at all
impossible), then there will be a
four-way tie for first, and the
league will be no farther along than
it was before the first, whistle.
Cal, which led the Southern Di
vision at the half-way mark, baa
been on the downgrade and will be
an underdog in the two tiffs. Tho
Bears will be without the services
of Tom Greenleaf, a footballer who
turned in his grid knickerbocker;
for the lighter basketball raiments.
Gieenleaf. v/ho likes basketball bet
ter than books, failed to make up
some tests in tune to play. This is
a heavy loss for Cal, because
Greenleaf was the play-maker and
steadying influence on the Bear:.:.
Nibs Price will also have to do
without guard Rupe Ricks c u,
who dislocated a shoulder in Ha
waii. Twin John Ricksen, who
hasn't completely recovered from
a sprained ankle incurred in the
first Stanford game, and guard
Jim Doan, who is slowed down by
a heel iniury, will start but won't
be at full effectiveness.
The main burden of Cal's victory
hopes will fall upon the 18-ycir
old shoulders of Bob McKeen, the
6 foot 7 freshman center. He is the
leading Berkeley scorer and con
sidered a great freshman prospect.
Forward Bob Albo and guard Jerry
Peterson round out the starting Cal.
