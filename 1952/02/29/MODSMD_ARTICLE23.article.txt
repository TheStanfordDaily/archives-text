If Stanford win* both games and
UCLA does likewise, the champion
ship would be the Bruins'. If UCLA,
which stands at the top of the heaji
with a six-and-four record, splits
and the Indians win both, then
Stanford and the Westwooders
would be tied. A sudden - death
play-off, most likely in Los Ange
les on Monday, would decide who
would meet Washington for the
PCC title. If Stanford split,; and
USC wins both (which is not at all
impossible), then there will be a
four-way tie for first, and the
league will be no farther along than
it was before the first, whistle.
Cal, which led the Southern Di
vision at the half-way mark, baa
been on the downgrade and will be
an underdog in the two tiffs. Tho
Bears will be without the services
of Tom Greenleaf, a footballer who
turned in his grid knickerbocker;
for the lighter basketball raiments.

some tests in tune to play. This is
a heavy loss for Cal, because
Greenleaf was the play-maker and
steadying influence on the Bear:.:.
Nibs Price will also have to do
without guard Rupe Ricks c u,
who dislocated a shoulder in Ha
waii. Twin John Ricksen, who
hasn't completely recovered from
a sprained ankle incurred in the
first Stanford game, and guard
Jim Doan, who is slowed down by
a heel iniury, will start but won't
be at full effectiveness.
The main burden of Cal's victory
hopes will fall upon the 18-ycir

leading Berkeley scorer and con

wise if would be a classic in rags

If Stanford win* both games and
UCLA does likewise, the champion
ship would be the Bruins'. If UCLA,
which stands at the top of the heaji
with a six-and-four record, splits
and the Indians win both, then
Stanford and the Westwooders
would be tied. A sudden - death
play-off, most likely in Los Ange
les on Monday, would decide who
would meet Washington for the
PCC title. If Stanford split,; and
USC wins both (which is not at all
impossible), then there will be a
four-way tie for first, and the
league will be no farther along than
it was before the first, whistle.
Cal, which led the Southern Di
vision at the half-way mark, baa

an underdog in the two tiffs. Tho
Bears will be without the services

Nibs Price will also have to do
without guard Rupe Ricks c u,
who dislocated a shoulder in Ha

hasn't completely recovered from
a sprained ankle incurred in the
first Stanford game, and guard
Jim Doan, who is slowed down by
a heel iniury, will start but won't
be at full effectiveness.
The main burden of Cal's victory
hopes will fall upon the 18-ycir
old shoulders of Bob McKeen, the
6 foot 7 freshman center. He is the
leading Berkeley scorer and con
sidered a great freshman prospect.
