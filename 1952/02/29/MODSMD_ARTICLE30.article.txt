# AAUSAF, Affiliation
## 
### 
Excorn, which Ihis quarter has found itself
in hot more than once with controversial
issues, now faces another decision on such a
question —the problem of joining the American
Association ol University Students for Aca
demic freedom.
W'• commend the Executive Committee on
theii action Wednesday in delaying any final
decision on this question until (I) the students
have had some chance to find out about the
AAUSAF, and (2) ihe reaction of tire students
to affiliation with this organization can be ascer
tain od.
Excorn has done its part—it has considered
the question and it is now asking the students
what they think ol the problem. To assist in
the clarilication ol llie issue, the details con
cerning the AAUSAF are given elsewhere on
this page.
However, this once again brings up the prob
lem ol the participation ol interested students
jii Ejccom's decisions. This problem has come
up not only with the Young Republicans, but
now, also, with the question of Berlin affiliation.
Criticism and opinion given to Excom before
it makes a decision is constructive and valuable.
It can assist Excom in doing its work with great
er surety. If a student has ample opportunity to
know what Excom discusses, and v/hut its ac
tions at'-, however, there is little or no room
foi griping alter a decision is made.
The Excom decision ol Berlin affiliation wan
attacked m yesU iday'e Campus OpiniSiY-by *
ii i.it - who stated that ihe Executive Committee
had no right to endorse .a lettei saying thai all
Stanford students are "enthusiastic" for the
proposal when they aren't.
Yet the question ol allilialion was cn the
Excom agenda lor three weeks belore the
hnal derision, and a thorough going analysis
ct the problem was presented in these col
umns. ('ritics had ample oppoitunity to ex
press then dissatisfaction ol the plan before
the final d> .' .sion loi affiliation.

Furthermore, it should be realized that ac
tions which are decided upon by a majoiity of
the representative governing body, Excorn,
after tliey have been given due consideration,
are necessarily taken in the name of the whole
qioup it jepresents.
This principle ol governmental action aj>
plies in all types ol qroup association whether
it be on the level cA a club, tin-? student body,
or the national (loveinment. Once a decision
{ '
is made, it is irude as il the entire qroup en
dorsed 11 wlioleheaite.dly — lor example, a
declaration ol war.
Participation by students in making that de
cision is then all important both from the point
of view ol the Excom representative and the
interested student,—Walt Menninger.
