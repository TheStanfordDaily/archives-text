# BULL SESSION
## A 						WARNING... 
### DICK McLEAN 
Men, strange things are going to happen to you
today. Things that will shock you) young souls and
•hake you down to your luiuidations 112 think there
is something tlist should be known. C!i 11aje not a
gi< .1? d* id different than most normal men. True, th<>
appealaiu es those surface manife- tations—are'a bit
misleading Ciiiis pretend that they .oen t interested
in males. They play haid to get, don't want to be
gotten, injured innorents. ;• n<l pa ■ ive resistance. It's
net that girls want to be this way. It's just that our
particulai ioriety demand:, it giils must be demure.

That is most of the time. G'nce
in a long while, one day out of
every four years to be exa; t, the
tat-.les are reversed lit that single
span of twenty-four hours the
young lovlier ay, "To hell with
convention All the socially dic
tated mores and taboos are over
thrown. It*, every man for him
self. And 1 pity the poor fellow
who doe: n't know. FOR TODAY
IS LEAP YEAR DAY. Today is
the 29'.h ol Febiuary. Beware,

I aft Monday night the Associated Women of Stan
ford Univei n met in secret midnight session. Th?y
developed a plan (.1 action lor Leap Day. This they
entitled "Operation Biartrap." Krom a confidential
source I have tin minute' of this meeting.
Resolved:
1) All Stanford women will turn out en mass on
said day for .1 final onslaught against the Stanford
males.
2) No Stanford miss wHI accept a male-offered
date. (Now you know why you kept striking out for
a date thi:; weekend )
.'s) All Stanlord p.irls will wear peasant blouses and
light sUmmei cottons regardless of weather. If it
should jain, tiny will wear a celophane raincoat.
I) All Stanford women will retire early on the
night before said Leap Day and gain at least nine
hours ot "L« auty sleep." (Twelve hours is, recom
mended in certain cases ) What's more they will even

put up their hair and polish their nails.
.1) The use of blackjacks, knockout drops, and
other weapons of violence will be considered a viola
tion of Fundamental Standard.
G) Any other means, however, are permissible.
Regardless of tactics and ethics it r.hall be required
of all Stanford girl.s to have a dot on the weekend
ol Leap L>ay. Any young lady in violation of this
principle 'hall come lip before Women's Council.
Strange things are going to happen on Quad this
moi When you walk down to class, you're
going U. flunk, "Who air all tliese beautiful friendly
gills? May he the San Jose State sorority girls are
holding a convention in Mem And." You may rec
ognize one ol the renovated beauties. You'll say to
yuuseh "N:v, that looks like a Stanford giil I know
No, No, that can't he her."
In i lass you'll notice some startling changes too.
The bevy ol girls that sit in the front row guarded
on onn side by the reader and a ferocious bull dog
on the other will .settle themselves all over the room.
Maybe one of them will come over and sit by you.
She'll take the seat next to yours and say in a per
fumed voit O, ' Well. 11.110 there."
Bel ore class is over she'll pass you a note asking,
"Will you take me out tonight? I'll buy you dinner
wherever you like, 112 have a green Oldsmobile con
vertible. I'm rich and friendly. Please."
(If this does happen, may I suggest that you teach
her exactly how much a date costs. Drink nothing but
French 7.')'s. Eat nothing hut filet mignon with ala
cart mushrooms. Ask her to tip the cute waitress,
Drive the hell out of hei car. 1.1. e up lots of gas. To
top things oH in a line old fashion don't even kiss her
goodnight. Kevenge, thy subtle sting is sweet.)
I began this Hull Session as a warning. It's not that
Leap Days are bad or their results undesirable. It's
just that a man likes to be aware of what is happen
ing and can plan accordingly.
In the words of the French general, Chanteux:
"Au diable les lengues vivantes obligatoires!"
Which Ireely translated means:
"The finest defense against a strong attack is a
