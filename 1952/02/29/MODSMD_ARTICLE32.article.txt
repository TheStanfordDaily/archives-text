## Emotion Charged in Berlin Opinion 
### 
To the Fditor:
I v/i.uld like to find out just why Mr. Pearlberger
and Mi Btckoi resent so much the affiliation between
Stanford and the Fit e University of Berlin, (hough of
â€¢ ouiTf th**y : ay only in their letter that 1 Ley "resent
the implii ition that all Stanford students favor the
affiliation."
Could it be that their resentment i.vdue to the fact

that thp Free University of Berlin was founded and
is operated in a clearly anti-Communistic spirit? Or
; hall we assume that there are emotional rather than
rational reasons for this resentment? Could it he
"ressentiment" rather than resentment? A public
answer from Mr. Becker and Mr. Perlbcrger would be
appreciated.
