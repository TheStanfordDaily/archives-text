(Ilditor's note: Lvcoin defeated
a motion Wednesday night to
malic it .elf Uir Stanford chapt *r
of Ibe American Association of
University Students for Academic ;
lieidom. Instead, K\con» favored
learning student opinion on the
organization, Kelow is a report of
tlie information Excnm has 're
reived concerning the AAI)SAI\)
'"lids is a u.ill to conscience."
So begins the original communi
cation l eeeived by Kxcom, a: king
for Stanford ruppori of the Ainriean
Association of University Student
for At ad-mi" Ei pedum.
The proposal lor such ari organi
zation originated in the unpds of
student body leader.-: at the Oniver
sity of Utah. These leaders, the
president (J ihe student body and
the editor ol a cujnpUs publication,
sent their "call to conscience" to
student leader.-; at 7(1(1 colleges and
universities aero s the- country.
They explained in the AAUSAF
prospectus, ''ll.eie are many ex
amples ol political- repression
against professors and students
in colleges throughout the coun
try. Thee are ominous clouds on
the academic hori.-on.
"In numerous cases serious mind
ed people at: the scene iai-.e funda
mental objection:, but sueli ueople
are usually i 'olated, numerically
weak, and impotent against the
pressures which are brought to bear
against them. They need (lie sup-|
port of like-minded people else- j
where. . . . This support can be :
mobilized.
"We propose to affiliate student?
throughout the country in the j
American Association of University
Students for Academic Freedom.
. . . We propose to launch this as

.social ion ai a conuiuttee ol coue
■ pojiri< ncc: a functionnl ejiUixj ise
l< (|,nc! national atLejitiou to indi
vidual caf.es."
'lln* Stanford E \coin, feeling
(lie pre- pectus w.is too nebulous,
m nt a letler to tlah asking fur
lhe i* ' perjf.e iiifiiiiiiation. Replied
the founder. of (In- otgaui/aiiou:
"We hop'' that intece students
on individual cainpuse.s will organ
ize chapters. . . . Actually member
ship i. httbi more than having oof's
name on Hit* mailing list. Wf have
ij o national eon litulion ul the; time;
. . . the association is . , . loosely

structured."
ilif basic purpose of tin* sliuc- ,
lure, us outlined by llu* founders,
is the t'ollcciioo and distribution
uf acinic mic lieedom news. The
AAKSAI I ' then hopes to locus a
national spotlight on ureas uf in- j
of acudeiuic freedom. ;
No specific financial obligation i.s \
involved in joining the organiza- |
tion, although voluntary contrihu- I

tons ajc solicited to support the
.ficadcmic Fieedom Newsletter, the
.proposed AAUSAF publication.
The leaders at Utah explain that
ti':e cojitent of the AAUSAF publi
cation is meant to inform and not
liind rnembois of the association on
i attcis of academic fieedom. "It i.s
i,tended to provide a service lor its
: iicmbt'i s, and Jiot to commit them
' u a particular course of action."
