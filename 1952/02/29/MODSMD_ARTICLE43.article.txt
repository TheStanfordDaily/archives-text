# JV Squad To Play Tonight
## 
### 
An improved Stanford JV will at
| tempt to revenge their double loss
| to the Cal Elues seven weeks ago
when the two teams chr h this
| weekend. Friday night the teams
will meet in Cal's gym, with the
tip-off slated for 7. Saturday eve
ning the teams clash again in the
Pavilion, starting at 6.
The Braves have come a long way
since their double drubbing at the
hands of Cal. They have won 13
straight and according to Gus Cha
valas "are as good as any JV on the
coast." Nevertheless, the beefy
Bears must rule as favorites. Cal
Coach Price likes to start a few
of varsity fodder in key JV games.
A fair guess at Cal's starting line
up might be Bobs Albo and Dirk
Froeschle at forwards, Frank Ifoag
land at center, and Ed Moser and
Ed Lipp treu at the guards.
Stanford will probably counter
j with Rick Carver and Howard
| Schwartz at forwards, Rus.; Lawler
at center, and Jim Johnson and
I Wayne Lockhart at guards.
