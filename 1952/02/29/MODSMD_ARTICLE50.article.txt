# Swimmers to Face Cal Poly
## 
### JIM MADISON 
Tom Haynie's NCAA contending
swimmers will meet Cal Poly in
their first home appearance of the
I season this afternoon at HiUO. There
will be no admission charge.
On a win-lose basis Cal Poly is
not expected to furnish much oppo
sition, so the Cards will again, as
against San Jose, be swimming to
beat Ilaynie's stop watch.
In the Spartan meet, the Cards
broke a bushelful of pool records,
hut turned in no times especially
worthy of national recognition.
The NCAA meet is only a month
j distant and Stanford has been a
| month or so behind its major oni
petition like Michigan, Yale, and
! Ohio State in training. As a result,
! Haynie has entered his men in their
j best events today, hoping that the
i times will narrow the gap in per
formances.
Only one Card headline!- will he
missing from the lineup this af
ternoon. Ash Jones, who had been
expected to approach 2:20 for the
200-yard breast-stroke, has been
sick with flu all week and will
not compete. .
I In his absence, Bob Frojen, whose
forte is "flying" shorter 100-yard
distance, will swim alone in the
breaststroke.
Frojen will also go the breast
stroke lap in the .100-yard med
ley relay, along with Larry Ileini
swimming backstroke and Bruce
Putnam in the anchor freestyle
post. Ilaynie hopes this trio, un
doubtedly his best, will break 2:55

for the event.
Haynie also expects top perform
ances from Pete Cole, 440; liob
Thompson, 220 and possibly 100;
Larry Heim, 200 backstroke; Jiin
Jaughram, 50; Bill XJlathe, diving;
j and his 400 - yard freestyle relay
combo of Thompson, Putnam,
Gaughram, and Bert Holiday.
