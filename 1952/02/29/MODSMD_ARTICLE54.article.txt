# Democrat Speaks

### HADLEY ROFF 
A short, bespectacled, quiet
speaking man who strangely resem
bles President Truman told The
Daily in a special interview Wed
ne day that he intends to make a
fight of the coming U.S. Senatorial
race in California.
Claiming that he is "diametrically
opposed" to the policies of incum
bent Senator* William F. Knowland,
Dewey Anderson, a Democrat, said
that he will cany his campaign "to
the folks of the state to be decided
on is ues that will spell war or
peace." ,
Rranding Knowland a "war
monger," the serious-talking Sen
ate-hopeful said that Knowland's
plan for the Nationalist invasion
of China "would mean 100 per
c ent commit til of U.S. armed
forces and the touching oIT of
World War 111."
In outlining his plan of action for
the Far East, Anderson, who framed
Truman's famous Point Four pro
gram, asked for the "building up
now of international unity and the
broadening of a Point Four pro
gram."
Declaring that Japan is "key to
peace in the Pacific," the thought
ful aspirant, who received a Ph.D.
in sociology from Stanford in 1!),')2,
urged putting Japan on a sound
economic base through Marshall-
Plan type aid.
Saving that peace in Asia de
pends on the relationship of in
dustrialized Japan with its neigh
bors, Anderson contended that "a
strong Japan will serve as a
bridge to other parts of Asia."
"Willi such a bridge, maybe
will come (be opportunity to
wean China from the Kremlin,"
be hoped.
Of Knowland's "get tough" pol
icy toward China, Anderson
charg 'd that "it is completely im
practical."
Citing figures of Nationalist army
strength, the long-time Washington
official said thai the .'300.000 troops
available are insufficient for either
an invasion or commando raids as
urged by Knowland.
"Further," he added, "other seri
ous considerations must be noted."
1. How will the troops be land
ed?
2. How and by whom will they be
supplied?
3. Who will supply air support?
"Such an invasion would obvi
ously depend on 100 per cent com
mittal of U.S. armed forces," An
derson asserted as he claimed "we
would stand alone in such a con
flict."
Advising that no allied support
could be expected, the greying, soft
voiced Anderson charged that

"even Chiang has no stomach for
such a conflict. Further, we have
no evidence of will on the part of
the average Chinese soldier to move
into war."
When asked what the U.S.
should do to case world tensions,
Anderson urged the extension of
Point Four help across the /{lobe.
That war stems Irom tin Â»ntr
veloped areas is obvious, be said,
as he carefully a
"workable foreign aid policy that
would not drain the American
economy."
Pointing out that foreign aid ex
penditures are far cheaper than
military spending, Anderson, asso
ciated since 19.19 with many gov
ernment planning councils, advised
that much of what would be spent
overseas would be returnable
through private investments.
When asked how soon he thought
the effects of such a relief program
would be reflected internationally,
he admitted he didn't know.
"Perhaps it's too late to do any
real good," he said gloomily as he
predicted that "the youth of the
nation will no doubt have to slug it
out in several more police actions
like Korea before we turn the tide
against Communism."
But he opined that "Point Four
offers the only real hope for peace."
Continuing, he said that in the
role of international relief-giver
the U.S. could trump the cards
of the Soviets. Describing Russia
as underdeveloped and unable to
offer relief, Anderson said that
American butter and wheat mean
more to the world than USSR
made guns and tanks.
Anderson, who looks more as if
he should be sitting behind a pro
fessor's desk on some campus rath
er than in a flag-draped campaign
headquarters, is an easy, courteous
man to talk with who backs down
on no questions. Exactly what in
fluence he'll have on the voters,
however, is not now known.
