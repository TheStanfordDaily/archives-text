# Cards Split With Cal; End Upwith 6-6 Mark
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
A Stanford basketball team which stunk out the joint Friday
night while losing to Cal, 6G to 52, ended the season on a happy
note by racing past the Bears, 70 to 65, Saturday before 3,000 com
pletely befrazzled rooters.
Thus, Bob Burnett, in his freshman year as head coach, guided

his team to a ift-won, !)—lost
record and a six-and-six mark iri
conference play. It v/as Stanford's
best conference record since 1943.
Also, the three departing seniors
bowed out in a classic blast, of
glory. Eddie Tucker and Jim Ram
stead joined the select "400 club,"
players who had scored 400 or more
points in one season. Tucker posted
point.;, second only to H ink
Luisetti's 465. Ramstead wound up
fourth (behind George Yardley's
423) with 415 points.
Ramstead, the (J-ft. 5-in. prod
net of San Francisco's Lincoln
High School, wound up as the
second highest scorer in Stanford
history with 9!)2 points for the
three-year period. Forward Jim
Walsh became the third highest
with 904. And Tucker, despite (lie
fact that he has on.'v played two
yci.vs, became tha sixth with 801.
Saturday night's tiff was not a
classic as far a; artistry of perform
ance is concerned, but for sheer ex
citement it was unbeatable.
The score changed hands as many
times as a flea changes dogs in a
dog fight.
Stanford erased a Cal 15 to 10
first-quarter advantage by jumping
to a 26 to 22 lead at half-time. The
Indians led by 10 points at one
time, hut Nibs Price's underlings
methodically cut the l«ad down and
led 54 to 52 with four minutes re
maining.
This was the cue for Jim Walsh,
the brown-haired Irishman from
San Francisco, go to work.
First, be meshed a free shot.
Then, on a typical Walsh broad
jump lay-in, be took o!T at the
key and never stopped until two
points were on the board. Fouled
in the attempt, he made good a
charity toss and then added an
other ;i moment later.
Ramstead, high point man with
IH, tallied on a tip-in and then a
pivot shot, but the r.eais sand
wiched ba ;kets between Stanford
shots to trail by two points, HI to
59. Jim Doan, Cal's blond, hard

y
driving guard, dunked a l;iy-in and
was fouled in the attempt.
Rather than try for the extra
point, the Bears took the ball out,
;ind one of the tensest one-minute
stalls in the history of the Pavilion
began. Cal didn't want to take any
shots until just a few seconds be
fore the buzzer, lest they lose the
ball, and the Indians didn't want to
press, lest they foul the Bears.
With 10 seconds remaining, the

Bears worked the ball in, and Clay
Grey just did manage to sink a
hook. Timer Elwyn Bugge gave the
kids from the Farm a new lease on
lile as he ruled the shot was made
n few seconds alter the buzzer.
The Cards took advantage of
that new lease.
Captain Ramstead, a wow all
with his rebounds, tipped
in a Tucker-shot, and Ron Tom
sir, lite jut - jawed rookie from
Ii« iinml High School, tanked two
free shots. C.il's E I Lippstreu
put Ihe hears in contention with
a set shot, hilt Walsh got them
riglil hack out of ctmlenlion with
a 20-foot swisher from the side,
(i7 lo o:i.
Rammer tipped two more in,
Donri scored, and the freeze was on.
With 15 seconds remaining, Tuker
was fouled. The lithe, cat-like for
v/ard, who has ice-water instead of
blood, meshed the final point ol his
collegiate career, and he, along
with Ramstead and Walsh, stepped
off the court amidst a standing ova
tion.
The Friday night game marked
Stanford's low of the season. The
tip-oil' was the free-shot percent
age. The Indians ,who went into
the game with the second highest
free-shot percentage in the nation
only made 10 out of 22 attempts.
The Bears led, 30 to 2(5, at half
time, and completely outclassed the
Cards in the second stanza. Only

Tomsic and Walsh kept the Indians
in contention.
The rags-to-riches tale that the
Indians had hoped for never be
came a reality. But they did end j
a good season on a triumphant

A Stanford basketball team which stunk out the joint Friday

Saturday night's tiff was not a

The score changed hands as many

Stanford erased a Cal 15 to 10

A Stanford basketball team which stunk out the joint Friday
night while losing to Cal, 6G to 52, ended the season on a happy
note by racing past the Bears, 70 to 65, Saturday before 3,000 com
pletely befrazzled rooters.
Thus, Bob Burnett, in his freshman year as head coach, guided

his team to a ift-won, !)—lost
record and a six-and-six mark iri
conference play. It v/as Stanford's
best conference record since 1943.
Also, the three departing seniors
bowed out in a classic blast, of
glory. Eddie Tucker and Jim Ram
stead joined the select "400 club,"
players who had scored 400 or more
points in one season. Tucker posted
point.;, second only to H ink
Luisetti's 465. Ramstead wound up
fourth (behind George Yardley's
423) with 415 points.
Ramstead, the (J-ft. 5-in. prod
net of San Francisco's Lincoln
High School, wound up as the
second highest scorer in Stanford
history with 9!)2 points for the
three-year period. Forward Jim
Walsh became the third highest
with 904. And Tucker, despite (lie
fact that he has on.'v played two
yci.vs, became tha sixth with 801.
Saturday night's tiff was not a
classic as far a; artistry of perform
ance is concerned, but for sheer ex
citement it was unbeatable.
The score changed hands as many
times as a flea changes dogs in a
dog fight.
Stanford erased a Cal 15 to 10
first-quarter advantage by jumping
to a 26 to 22 lead at half-time. The
Indians led by 10 points at one
time, hut Nibs Price's underlings
methodically cut the l«ad down and
led 54 to 52 with four minutes re
maining.
This was the cue for Jim Walsh,
the brown-haired Irishman from
San Francisco, go to work.
First, be meshed a free shot.
Then, on a typical Walsh broad
jump lay-in, be took o!T at the
key and never stopped until two
points were on the board. Fouled
in the attempt, he made good a
charity toss and then added an
other ;i moment later.
Ramstead, high point man with
IH, tallied on a tip-in and then a
pivot shot, but the r.eais sand
wiched ba ;kets between Stanford
shots to trail by two points, HI to
59. Jim Doan, Cal's blond, hard

y
driving guard, dunked a l;iy-in and
was fouled in the attempt.
Rather than try for the extra
point, the Bears took the ball out,
;ind one of the tensest one-minute
stalls in the history of the Pavilion
began. Cal didn't want to take any
shots until just a few seconds be
fore the buzzer, lest they lose the
ball, and the Indians didn't want to
press, lest they foul the Bears.
With 10 seconds remaining, the


STILL LIFE—Jim Doan of Cal and Jim Walsh of Stanford form a bizarre pattern as Walsh casts
off from behind the backboard. Jim Ramstead and Cal's Ray Moser prepare to fight for the re
bound. —Daily photo by Herb Smith
Bears worked the ball in, and Clay
Grey just did manage to sink a
hook. Timer Elwyn Bugge gave the
kids from the Farm a new lease on
lile as he ruled the shot was made
n few seconds alter the buzzer.
The Cards took advantage of
that new lease.
Captain Ramstead, a wow all
with his rebounds, tipped
in a Tucker-shot, and Ron Tom
sir, lite jut - jawed rookie from
Ii« iinml High School, tanked two
free shots. C.il's E I Lippstreu
put Ihe hears in contention with
a set shot, hilt Walsh got them
riglil hack out of ctmlenlion with
a 20-foot swisher from the side,
(i7 lo o:i.
Rammer tipped two more in,
Donri scored, and the freeze was on.
With 15 seconds remaining, Tuker
was fouled. The lithe, cat-like for
v/ard, who has ice-water instead of
blood, meshed the final point ol his
collegiate career, and he, along
with Ramstead and Walsh, stepped
off the court amidst a standing ova
tion.
The Friday night game marked
Stanford's low of the season. The
tip-oil' was the free-shot percent
age. The Indians ,who went into
the game with the second highest
free-shot percentage in the nation
only made 10 out of 22 attempts.
The Bears led, 30 to 2(5, at half
time, and completely outclassed the
Cards in the second stanza. Only

Tomsic and Walsh kept the Indians
in contention.
The rags-to-riches tale that the
Indians had hoped for never be
came a reality. But they did end j
a good season on a triumphant
note.
