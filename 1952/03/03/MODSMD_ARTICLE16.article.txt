# Manhole Lids Dangerous to Tamper With
## 
### 
Several manhole covers on cam
pus, one of which contained a 4,000-
volt terminal, were tampered with,
and one of them was replaced up
side down, according to Carroll
Blacker, Superintendent of Build
ings and Grounds.
Blacker warned that it is very
dangerous to remove these covers,
as there is the possibility of getting
electrocuted.
Blacker explained that the man
hole covers are part of an under
ground primary system which cir
culates electricity to various build
ings on campus.
