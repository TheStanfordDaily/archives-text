Before several hundred students
the Biz School Four won the fea
tured quartet contest yesterday at
the opening of Lake Lagunita.
The winners, Wayne Lambert,
Bill Wilson, Dick Eberharter, and
Bob Barton of Remele Hall, were
awarded the donation from Rossot
ti's as first prize.
Taking second and third place
were the Theta Xi's and the Phi
Sigs' "Uncalled Four." The Theta
Xi's won a cleaning order from
Cardinal Cleaners and a bathing
suit given by Roos Bros. Four
scarves from Rita on Ramona were
won by the Uncalled Four.
Judging the competition were
sophomore John Tucker, varsity
basketballer Ron Tomsic, and Har
ry Borcher, AAU All - American

water polo player.
The first canoes on the water
were signed out for by two Encina
men, Paul Revalc and Ron Hertel.
Although the water temperature
was in the low fifties, a number of
students plied between the rafts

and the boathouse.
Before the lake had been open ; n
hour, the first casualty of the youiv;
season occurred when three fresh •
men capsized the canoe they were
in near the rafts. The only damage
was a dunking in the chilly water.
