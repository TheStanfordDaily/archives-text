# VOLUME BUYING
## Houses Plan Lower Costs 
### JIM MADISON 
Stanford's Jraternities have
taken a notable step toward rc
ducing llic houses' operating
costs.
The organization for an improved
cooperative buying program has been
set up and approved hy the Inter
fraternity Board of Control. The
program is planned to take increased
advantage of the volume buying po
sition represented hy the combined
requirements of Stanford's 24 fra
ternities.
Since the non -profit Village com
missary was set up in 1046, the fra
ternities have done much of their
food buying from it. However, no
method has been available to coordi
nate the fraternity buying with the
commissary buying, and thus Iske
full advantage of seasonal and vol
ume price markdowns.
Loss of Volume
Further, a uutnhet of fraternities
] have continued to buy through com
petitive supply firms. This loss of
I volume ha . been another reason for
the Commissary not attaining as good
[ a price position as possible.
Contracts are now being drawn by
j Howard Allen, Assistant Dean of
the Law School, which will require
all the fraternities joining in the
agreement to purchase from the
Commissary a minimum percentage
j (the actual figure will be around 85
| to 03%) of their needs in the lines
j of goods the Commissary handles, in
' eluding chiefly meats and groceries.
Twenty fraternities have indicated
I they will sign the contracts as soon

as they are prepared, probably within
the next two weeks. Participation of
the other four is hoped for by Rod
Hills. Housemanagers' Association
President.
Administration
The program will be administered
by two new committees, strengthen
ing the present, executive branch of
the Association.
One will be a Board of Governors
to interpret policies growing out of
the buying contracts and to deal with
any violations of the contracts.
This group is also planned to as
sume the administration of other fra
ternity financial and physical plant
problems, including auditing of the
accounts and kitchen inspection.
This is presently done by IFC.
The membership will consist of the
chairman of the Houscmanagcrs' As
sociation, IFC president, two mem
bers -at-large from the Houscmanag
crs' Association, the chairman of the
Commissary Committee (see below),
Men's Counselor (Mr. Balch), an
alumni representative, and two rep
; resent a tives from the University
I busine: s office.
I Its relation to the Housemanagers'
j Association will roughly parallel that
| of the IFB to the lt''C, the association
of house presidents.
Commissary Committee
The other committee will initially
| be called the Commissary Committee,
j Us membership will include five
members of the Housemanagers' As
j sociation who will elcct their own
j chairman. In addition the manager 1
i of the Village Commissary will have
an cx-oiTieio membership.
The function of this committee will 1

be to recommend and effect more
standard methods of ordering an I
delivering goods from the Commis
sary.
Improvement of commissary serv
ice is only one aim of the new pro
gram. The commissary committc -
will also investigate and effect meth -
ods by which other items such as
linen and furniture may be reduci I
in coft to the houses by combining
their purchases.
