# Honor Code Pollâ€”An Evaluation
## 
### 
The results of the poll on the Honor Code's
effectiveness on page one of today's Daily, are
pretty good assurance that the code is success
ful at Stanford. Not a complete, unqualified
success, but it ns nonetheless effective to the
degree that no serious reconsideration of the
code is necessary.
After 11 years of operation, it is probably a
permanent part of Stanford's academic life.
The 3,078 returned questionnaires are cer
lainly an adequate quantitative sampling. Tiua,
the other 3,000 some students who failed to re
turn blanks might tell a different story, but the
respondents we r,e sufficiently distributed
among living groups, class, and sex to preclude
u really one-sided picture.
But while the poll reveals many blight
spots, it also indicates the code is not as
effective as it might be. Only 14 students
thought it was "not woikinq," but 312 or 10
per cent thought it functioned "faiily well,
but needs overhauling."
This percentage would amount to some 700
students it projected over the entire enrollment.
A pretty sizeable number.
ICI students, of about 3,000 responding said
they have at one time or another given un
pei mitted aid in academic work. 444 said they
"probably" had. Roughly similar results ob
tained on the question on receiving unper
initted aid.
The "probably's" are a pretty good indica
tion that many students are ignorant as to what
actually constitutes code violations.
The poll reveals there is considerable con
fusion as to whom violations should be report
ed, whether the code applies to academic work
outside of examinations, whether penalties
"almost always involve suspension," and other

basic aspects of the code's operations indicating
honor code indoctrination may he incomplete.
The indoctrination given incoming I tosh
and translers is fine. Possibly, however a
re-emphasis indoctrination is needed. This
could be accomplished through living
groups, other then freshmen dorms, once or
twice a year.
A sure and thoroughgoing knowledge of
what the code involves and the individual stu
dent's responsibilities ate certainly essentials
for the code's successful operation.
The true-false section ol the questionnaire,
containing facts (oi fallacies) about the code's
operation shows many students don't have this
knowledge. Only five respondents were able
to answer all the questions in this section cor
rectly.
Such points as take-home tests and outside
papers and reports evidently need further
clarification. Dishonesty in those endeavors is
just as much a code violation as in exarnina
tions taken inside the classroom.
The area most in need ol improvement as
revealed by the pull is third person tespon
sibility. Many violations are going unrepctl
ed because "violator is a good friend''';
"Wouldn't want the person to know 1
squealed"; "Don't know how or where to re
port" violations; "Don't like to get involved
in a mess," and for other reasons.
Whether we like it or not, and distasteful
and unpleasant as reporting violations may be,
the third person responsibility as the code now
exists is essential if it is to continue operative.
We look upon the Honor Code as a great
privilege. We see it as a mature way of hand
ling our academic affairs. With the privilege
goes the responsibility of seeing that it is not
abused.

The indoctrination given incoming I tosh
and translers is fine. Possibly, however a
re-emphasis indoctrination is needed. This
could be accomplished through living
groups, other then freshmen dorms, once or
twice a year.
A sure and thoroughgoing knowledge of
what the code involves and the individual stu
dent's responsibilities ate certainly essentials
for the code's successful operation.
The true-false section ol the questionnaire,
containing facts (oi fallacies) about the code's
operation shows many students don't have this
knowledge. Only five respondents were able
to answer all the questions in this section cor
rectly.
Such points as take-home tests and outside
papers and reports evidently need further
clarification. Dishonesty in those endeavors is
just as much a code violation as in exarnina
tions taken inside the classroom.
The area most in need ol improvement as
revealed by the pull is third person tespon
sibility. Many violations are going unrepctl
ed because "violator is a good friend''';
"Wouldn't want the person to know 1
squealed"; "Don't know how or where to re
port" violations; "Don't like to get involved
in a mess," and for other reasons.
Whether we like it or not, and distasteful
and unpleasant as reporting violations may be,
the third person responsibility as the code now
exists is essential if it is to continue operative.
We look upon the Honor Code as a great
privilege. We see it as a mature way of hand
ling our academic affairs. With the privilege
goes the responsibility of seeing that it is not
abused.
The results of the poll on the Honor Code's
effectiveness on page one of today's Daily, are
pretty good assurance that the code is success
ful at Stanford. Not a complete, unqualified
success, but it ns nonetheless effective to the
degree that no serious reconsideration of the
code is necessary.
After 11 years of operation, it is probably a
permanent part of Stanford's academic life.
The 3,078 returned questionnaires are cer
lainly an adequate quantitative sampling. Tiua,
the other 3,000 some students who failed to re
turn blanks might tell a different story, but the
respondents we r,e sufficiently distributed
among living groups, class, and sex to preclude
u really one-sided picture.
But while the poll reveals many blight
spots, it also indicates the code is not as
effective as it might be. Only 14 students
thought it was "not woikinq," but 312 or 10
per cent thought it functioned "faiily well,
but needs overhauling."
This percentage would amount to some 700
students it projected over the entire enrollment.
A pretty sizeable number.
ICI students, of about 3,000 responding said
they have at one time or another given un
pei mitted aid in academic work. 444 said they
"probably" had. Roughly similar results ob
tained on the question on receiving unper
initted aid.
The "probably's" are a pretty good indica
tion that many students are ignorant as to what
actually constitutes code violations.
The poll reveals there is considerable con
fusion as to whom violations should be report
ed, whether the code applies to academic work
outside of examinations, whether penalties
"almost always involve suspension," and other

basic aspects of the code's operations indicating
honor code indoctrination may he incomplete.
