### PETE GROTHE 
Ail 1 know is what I read in the newspapers.
— Will Rogers
I'm afraid that if the beloved homespun philosopher
from Oklahoma were reading the newspapers today
that he would be a mighty perplexed man. For I
know that from what I read in the newspapers that
there arc some strange things happening in this world
of ours.
I picked up a local fish wrapper recently and read
that an organization demanded that the United Na
tions recognize its claim to mineral rights in a 75-

mile-long-area of the moon. And
the name of this organization is
"The Berkeley Elves. Gnomes, and
Little Men's Science, Fiction,
Chowder, and Marching Society."
And it occurs to me that Mr.
Austin, Mr. Vinshinsky, and all
the other gentlemen who speak
various and sundry languages at
the U.N. have enough to worry
about right here on this little old
earth without listening to claims

on the moon. Especially by an organization that
calls itself "Hie Berkeley Elves, Gnomes, and Little
Men's Science, Fiction, Chowder, and Marching So
ciety."
Then 1 read in a later newspaper that a gentleman
who goes by the monicker ot Alexander F. Victor
offered to sell "exclusive" property on the moon for
$1,000 an acre.
Mr. Victor, inventor of the Victor Talking Machine,
shouts, "The Berkeley Little Men's claim is illegal.
Don L be surprised if I Uikn this to the Supreme Court.
I made contact with the moon two years ago and gut
exclusive title. The Berkeley Little Men will have to
claim their title through me. And,"he hanumphed,
"1 have a very exclusive real estate development in
mind. I'm charging $1,000 an acre with 10 per cent ofT
if you buy more than 10 acres at a time."
The United Press dispatch says that Mr. Victor is

84 years old. Which is old enough to know up from
down. Maybe Mr. Victor has something. If real
estate can "make" Los Angeles, why can't it make
the moon a thriving enterprise. Probably a lot less
smog up there.
But this is not all I read in the newspapers.
Not too long ago, 1 read where 19-year old Liz
Taylor committed marriage with a 41-year-old Eng
lish actor named Michael Wilding. 1 quote from the
article: "Miss Taylor promptly announced that she
wanted to have a large family.
" 'llow many?' a reported asked.
"Smiling radiantly at a champagne reception at
Claridge's swank hotel, she replied in her slow,
velvety voice, 'Why, just as many as possible.'
"Photograph?rs clamored for Elizabeth and Wilding
to kiss, but they refused. I'm too shy, said Elizabeth,
lowering her eyes."
All of which makes me want to suggest to Miss
Taylor that she get one of Mr. Victor's plots on the
moon pronto. The eaith is no place for shy people.
Also, each of Miss Taylor's children can have his
own crater to motor his Buck Rodgers kiddie car
in. Most important, we folks down here on earth
would he spared Miss Taylor's poisonous acting.
Another item 1 came across was about a woman
named Mrs. Mac Donald who was suing her husband
for divorce because of "the other woman." The "other
woman" being her mother. In short, Mr. Mac Do
nald was nuts about his mother-in-law. This is spring,
love is in the air, and it pleases me very much to see
that family relations arp so good between Mr. Mac-
Donald and his mother-in-law that he wants to marry
her.
1 don't know where this leaves the younger Mrs.
Mac Donald. Maybe she'll join the Berkeley Elves,
noir.es, and Little Men's Science, Fiction. Chowder,
and Marching Society.
And as 1 say, Will Rogers would be a mighty per
plexed man il he started to read the papers these
days.

of ours.
I picked up a local fish wrapper recently and read
that an organization demanded that the United Na
tions recognize its claim to mineral rights in a 75-

mile-long-area of the moon. And
the name of this organization is
"The Berkeley Elves. Gnomes, and
Little Men's Science, Fiction,
Chowder, and Marching Society."
And it occurs to me that Mr.
Austin, Mr. Vinshinsky, and all
the other gentlemen who speak
various and sundry languages at
the U.N. have enough to worry
about right here on this little old
earth without listening to claims

on the moon. Especially by an organization that
calls itself "Hie Berkeley Elves, Gnomes, and Little
Men's Science, Fiction, Chowder, and Marching So
ciety."
Then 1 read in a later newspaper that a gentleman
who goes by the monicker ot Alexander F. Victor
offered to sell "exclusive" property on the moon for
$1,000 an acre.
Mr. Victor, inventor of the Victor Talking Machine,
shouts, "The Berkeley Little Men's claim is illegal.
Don L be surprised if I Uikn this to the Supreme Court.
I made contact with the moon two years ago and gut
exclusive title. The Berkeley Little Men will have to
claim their title through me. And,"he hanumphed,
"1 have a very exclusive real estate development in
mind. I'm charging $1,000 an acre with 10 per cent ofT
if you buy more than 10 acres at a time."
The United Press dispatch says that Mr. Victor is

84 years old. Which is old enough to know up from
down. Maybe Mr. Victor has something. If real
estate can "make" Los Angeles, why can't it make
the moon a thriving enterprise. Probably a lot less
smog up there.
But this is not all I read in the newspapers.
Not too long ago, 1 read where 19-year old Liz
Taylor committed marriage with a 41-year-old Eng
lish actor named Michael Wilding. 1 quote from the
article: "Miss Taylor promptly announced that she
wanted to have a large family.
" 'llow many?' a reported asked.
"Smiling radiantly at a champagne reception at
Claridge's swank hotel, she replied in her slow,
velvety voice, 'Why, just as many as possible.'
"Photograph?rs clamored for Elizabeth and Wilding
to kiss, but they refused. I'm too shy, said Elizabeth,
lowering her eyes."
All of which makes me want to suggest to Miss
Taylor that she get one of Mr. Victor's plots on the
moon pronto. The eaith is no place for shy people.
Also, each of Miss Taylor's children can have his
own crater to motor his Buck Rodgers kiddie car
in. Most important, we folks down here on earth
would he spared Miss Taylor's poisonous acting.
Another item 1 came across was about a woman
named Mrs. Mac Donald who was suing her husband
for divorce because of "the other woman." The "other
woman" being her mother. In short, Mr. Mac Do
nald was nuts about his mother-in-law. This is spring,
love is in the air, and it pleases me very much to see
that family relations arp so good between Mr. Mac-
Donald and his mother-in-law that he wants to marry
her.
1 don't know where this leaves the younger Mrs.
Mac Donald. Maybe she'll join the Berkeley Elves,
noir.es, and Little Men's Science, Fiction. Chowder,
and Marching Society.
