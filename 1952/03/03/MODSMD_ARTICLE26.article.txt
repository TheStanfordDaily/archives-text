# CAMPUS OPINION
## In Favor of Foreign Language Requirements 
### 
To the Editor:
If Stalin were to read Mr. Grothe's indirect pleas
for the abolition of the language requirement—cor
rection, if he knew enough English to read them—he
would be delighted to find such a staunch advocate of
the Iron Curtain at Stanford. What is an Iron Curtain
if not a series of restrictions on what people inside may
jlearn about the people outside?
For Mr. Grothe, the limit is to be drawn at the En
glish language. Beyond that, he is willing to rely im
plicitly on translations, forgetting that these may con
tain special pleading of which the readei is not aware,
and that they may come too late to be of use.
The works of Mao Tse Tung are available to date in
Chinese, Russian, and French. Which of these is likely
to be the closest *o the true Mao? An English trans
lation is promised for 1953. Can we afford to be ignorant
until then? Must we let ourselves be taken in by
propaganda?
The world situation in this atomic age compels us
to look at our enemies. Dare we turn our backs on
them as well as on our friends? Axis newspapers in
Shanghai predicted Pearl Harbor several weeks before
the actual date. Soviet-controlled German newspapers
discussed a Korea campaign in 1949! These materials
are available to us in time to use them—unless we
deliberately maintain our own ignorance and prevent
students coming after us from learning to take ad
vantage of the unique facilities of Stanford and the
Hoover Library.
To specific points of Mr. Grothe's columns, he claims
to look into the future with points 1 and 2. The post
• war trend appears to go toward more use of languages
by students, with members of the armed forces, gov

ernment, industries, and the professions poing abroad.
Likewise, more people come to the United States,
and the stay-at -homes can do untold harm. Last year's
controversy on The Daily's interview of a Spanish
refugee and an exchange professor from the same
country was a classic example of how not to treat
foreign students.
To point 2. Unless a student has selected his objec
tive and treats all courses as preparation for it—easily
done in language all courses taken at the university
remain hypothetical as regards their use.
To point 3, the number ol units in comparison with
other requirements: A survey course in the entire
field of language on the undergraduate level could
easily be organized. Any reader familiar with Hogben's
"Loom ol Language" and with language classes on the
same level will find this like meeting, say, Dante in
Western Civ compared to taking a seminar on him.
If the survey were all that is necessary, why does
anyone specialize in any field touched by it? Why are
no degrees given at the end of the 12 unit:;?
Mr. Cirothe's views and those of the people he rep
resents is backward and unrealistic. We are not "let
ting the winds of freedom blow' if we limit our knowl
edge to the English-speaking world.* We are not mak
ing Stanford a better university by lowering our stand
ards. Dare we, the students of Stanford, underwrite
ignorance? Dare we, at our peril, withdraw behind
an Iron Curtain of our own making, while the rest of
the world is free to observe and investigate lis?

The world situation in this atomic age compels us
to look at our enemies. Dare we turn our backs on
them as well as on our friends? Axis newspapers in
Shanghai predicted Pearl Harbor several weeks before
the actual date. Soviet-controlled German newspapers

To specific points of Mr. Grothe's columns, he claims
to look into the future with points 1 and 2. The post
• war trend appears to go toward more use of languages
by students, with members of the armed forces, gov

ernment, industries, and the professions poing abroad.
Likewise, more people come to the United States,
and the stay-at -homes can do untold harm. Last year's
controversy on The Daily's interview of a Spanish
refugee and an exchange professor from the same
country was a classic example of how not to treat
foreign students.

To point 3, the number ol units in comparison with
other requirements: A survey course in the entire
field of language on the undergraduate level could
easily be organized. Any reader familiar with Hogben's
"Loom ol Language" and with language classes on the
same level will find this like meeting, say, Dante in
Western Civ compared to taking a seminar on him.
If the survey were all that is necessary, why does
anyone specialize in any field touched by it? Why are
no degrees given at the end of the 12 unit:;?
Mr. Cirothe's views and those of the people he rep
resents is backward and unrealistic. We are not "let

edge to the English-speaking world.* We are not mak

ignorance? Dare we, at our peril, withdraw behind
an Iron Curtain of our own making, while the rest of

If Stalin were to read Mr. Grothe's indirect pleas
for the abolition of the language requirement—cor
rection, if he knew enough English to read them—he
would be delighted to find such a staunch advocate of
the Iron Curtain at Stanford. What is an Iron Curtain
if not a series of restrictions on what people inside may
jlearn about the people outside?
For Mr. Grothe, the limit is to be drawn at the En
glish language. Beyond that, he is willing to rely im
plicitly on translations, forgetting that these may con
tain special pleading of which the readei is not aware,
and that they may come too late to be of use.
The works of Mao Tse Tung are available to date in
Chinese, Russian, and French. Which of these is likely
to be the closest *o the true Mao? An English trans
