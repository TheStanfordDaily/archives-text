# 'DESIRE UNDER THE ELMS'
## Players' Production Has Unusual Setting 
### 
The set for the Stanford Players
production of Eugene O'Neill's "De
sire Under the Elms" is "a feat ol
engineering by the drama depart
ment stage crews," according to A.
Nicholas Vardac, director of the
play.
The set is unusual in that it shows
an entire house, upstairs and down
stairs, with all the walls removed,

thus promoting an unreal and sym
bolical effect.
Wendell Cole, in charge of the
scenery, has tried to give an aware
ness of both the farm and the out
of-doors in his designs of a frame
which suggests a farmhouse but
which is not enclosed by walls.
Delford Brummer is in charge of
lighting effects, and Virginia Opsvig
has designed costumes of the mid
19th century which contribute to the
tragic tone of the plays.
Commenting further on O'Neill's
plays, Vardac said that they were
very difficult to produce, as only a
professional company or a very ad
vanced college organization could
manage the complicated sets and the
high quality of acting necessary.
Tickets for "Desire Under the
Elms," second production of the
Players current subscription, may be
obtained at the Memorial Hall Box
Office and at the Peninsula Box
Office in Palo Alto, at 75 cents each.
