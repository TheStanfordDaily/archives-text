in five second-half field goals to
sink Stanford.
Saturday's game was the season's
high point. Stanford's tricky alter
nating defense, fast break, and the
backboard work of Russ Lawlor
baffled the Bears, and only Cal's
many free throws kept them in the
contest.
Real Card hero was, as usual,
Russ Lawler. The huge Lav/ler at
one time blocked lour consecutive

| shots in midair. He dumped in 15,
| points and controlled about half of j
the rebounds. A 1 Mathews of Cal j
was unable to score against him. ,
Lawler has nearly driven Daily j
sports - writers sane searching foi
new superlatives to heap on him
this year. Suffice it to say he looks j
like another Yardley.
