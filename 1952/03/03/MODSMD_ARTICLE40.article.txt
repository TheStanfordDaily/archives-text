## 
### 
Tom Haynie's swimmers counted
coup for the second time in as many
starts Friday afternoon by over
whelming Cal Poly 74 to 11.
The Cards, paced by their record
| breaking medley relay team, swept
| every first place and all but one
1 second spot.
The medley relay team of Larry
| Heim, backstroke; Captain Bob
j Frojen, breaststroke; and Bruce
Putnam, freestyle, swam to a new
Stanford record in 2:52.G.
Stanford also turned in a good
time for the 400-yard freestyle re
lay. A team of Putnam, Jim
Gaughran, Bert Holiday, and Bob
| Thompson won this event in 3:32.9.
j Two other Stanford teams, swim
i ming unofficially, also beat the Cal
Poly entry.
Jim Gaughran sprinted a fast
:23.G for the 50, but the rest of the
times were not what might be

I called scintillating.
Thompson copped the 220 in 2:12
with Dan Osborne a close second in
2:13; Holiday loafed to victory ir.
the individual medley with a time
of 1:38.9.
Bill Glathe won the (living in a
; performance that was .'â€¢potty but
promising. Hi.s point total came tc
| 323.9.
Larry Heim took his backstrokc
specialty in 2:14.6, an excellent
time by any comparison in the
country except his own personal
Standard and that which will be
| necessary to beat Ohio State's Jack
Taylor in the inCAA meet. John
j Weiser was second in 2:17.7.
Frojen came back to win the
jbreaststroke with a time of 2:26.9.
Alter going out slowly, Pete Cole
attempted to rally but r*in out of
gas in the la.vt couple of laps to turn
j in a slow 4:50.7 in winning the 440
