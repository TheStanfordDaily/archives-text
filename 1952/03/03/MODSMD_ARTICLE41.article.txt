### 
Stanford's baseballers made it
| three straight as they downed San
j Jose State 7 to (5 in a sloppily
| played game Saturday in the Sun
ken Diamond. On Friday, darkness
halted a classier 3 to 3 tie with USF.
Fiidav's afTair found the Cards
unable to capitalize on 12 hits and
| four Don bobbles. Pitchers Bob
Murphy and Phil Page limited
! USF to three hits, but one of them
was a bases-loaded triple in the
third frame. Warren Goodrich
pounded out three hits and
Chuck Essegian wrapped out a
triple and a single.
On Saturday, two ninth - inning
Spartan bobbles brought Stanford
I the win. The Cards apparently iced
i the game in the fourth when, with
the score 2 all, Essegian hit his
third triple of the season, Pay
Swartz singled, Owen Powell
smacked a double to left-center,
and a Rog Osenbaugh bunt sacri

j ficed in two runs.
r I lie Spartans came l>ack in the
fifth, however, when Osenbaugh
walked three straight and then
flashy - fielding shortstop Warren
Goodrich momentarily fell apart
, with the result that the Staters
pushed four runs :u.i»ss on one
liit. In the eighth. Stanford lied
it up again on t»vo walks and an
other single by Swartz. In the
last frame, Goodrich singled over
i second, went to third on a wild
! throw, and scored as Spartan
third - baseman Boh Glavcs bob
bled a Dick Cole grounder.
For Stanford, Rog
went seven innings and gave up
four hits. Only a lack of control
and some poor fielding by him and
his infielders co.,t him. Ken Brown
worked the eighth and looked good
and Phil Page came in to pitch the
ninth and get the win.
