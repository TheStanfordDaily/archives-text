# Martin Surveys U.S. Political Campaign
## 
### HADLEY ROFF 
Since Dr. Boyd Martin's grad
uation from Stanford in 1943, he
has kept close tabs on America's |
political pulse beat. And with
each year, he claims, he has felt
that vital throb beat with greater
strength.
Often, during an interview Fri- 1
day, the soft-speaking, easy-smil
ing visiting professor of political j
science from the University cf Ida
ho told of his confidence in the !
American people and in their abil
ity to "engineer greater civil lib
erties for the world."
"The average voter sits down !
and gives intelligent considera
tion to political issues," Martin
asserted as he said "that kind of
action spells greatness."
When questioned about the ap
parent apathy among voters over
the coming election, Martin said
that Americans, on the whole,
carefully consider such actions
and, if vitally affected by the is
sues at stake, will vote.
He reviewed America's past and I

how the nation was maneuvered to
th" front rank of liberal powers.
"What nation has weathered a
Civil War, major depressions, and
two World Wars without having to
radically alter its economic and po
litical structure?" he observed.
Admitting that soma change has
been wrought in the economic
sphere, he insisted that "while oth
er nations have become wed to So
cialism, Communism, or Fascism,
we're still woriting within the
bounds of our original capitalist
system."
Turning to current politics,
Martin described President Harry
Truman as one of the master po
litical strategists in American
history and said that he no doubt
will seek re-election. He advised
that Democratic bosses are en
couraging Truman to run because
they fear Kcfauvcr will embar
rass the party with his house
cleaning claims.
Discussing Truman as President,
Martin said that he was "not a big
man" but that he knew politics.
Describing Truman's political edu
cation with the notorious Pender
gast machine of Missouri. Martin
said that the present President
learned politics "from the ground
up."
Martin said that the Truman ad
ministration deserves great credit
for its civil right, and for contain
ing Russia with the Marshall Plan
and the North Atlantic Pact.
Questioned as to which party
will next occupy the White House,
Martin thoughtfully rubbed his
jaw for moment, then shrugged
and said, "Who knows?*'
Of the Republicans. Martin said
that Taft most likely would be
party standard bearer i;s Eisen
hower's chances lessen with each
d.'y he remains in Europe.
When asked what a change in
administration might mean, he said
that the effect of a new regime
would be fell little. He said that
both parties stand much alike on
most isiites and that Republicans
would follow closely the path
mowed by Democrats.
Martin said that both parties
today are committed to a system
he called "democratic collectiv
ism.'' which offers federal pro
tection against economic and social
inequities without violating the
principle of private ownership.
Such a system, he said, "is pro
gre sive and will insure America's
democracy."

DR. BOYD MARTIN
Expresses faith in people
Since Dr. Boyd Martin's grad
uation from Stanford in 1943, he
has kept close tabs on America's |
political pulse beat. And with
each year, he claims, he has felt
that vital throb beat with greater
strength.
Often, during an interview Fri- 1
day, the soft-speaking, easy-smil
ing visiting professor of political j
science from the University cf Ida
ho told of his confidence in the !
American people and in their abil
ity to "engineer greater civil lib
erties for the world."
"The average voter sits down !
and gives intelligent considera
tion to political issues," Martin
asserted as he said "that kind of
action spells greatness."
When questioned about the ap
parent apathy among voters over
the coming election, Martin said
that Americans, on the whole,
carefully consider such actions
and, if vitally affected by the is
sues at stake, will vote.
He reviewed America's past and I

how the nation was maneuvered to
th" front rank of liberal powers.
"What nation has weathered a
Civil War, major depressions, and
two World Wars without having to
radically alter its economic and po
litical structure?" he observed.
Admitting that soma change has
been wrought in the economic
sphere, he insisted that "while oth
er nations have become wed to So
cialism, Communism, or Fascism,
we're still woriting within the
bounds of our original capitalist
system."
Turning to current politics,
Martin described President Harry
Truman as one of the master po
litical strategists in American
history and said that he no doubt
will seek re-election. He advised
that Democratic bosses are en
couraging Truman to run because
they fear Kcfauvcr will embar
rass the party with his house
cleaning claims.
Discussing Truman as President,
Martin said that he was "not a big
man" but that he knew politics.
Describing Truman's political edu
cation with the notorious Pender
gast machine of Missouri. Martin
said that the present President
learned politics "from the ground
up."
Martin said that the Truman ad
ministration deserves great credit
for its civil right, and for contain
ing Russia with the Marshall Plan
and the North Atlantic Pact.
Questioned as to which party
will next occupy the White House,
Martin thoughtfully rubbed his
jaw for moment, then shrugged
and said, "Who knows?*'
Of the Republicans. Martin said
that Taft most likely would be
party standard bearer i;s Eisen
hower's chances lessen with each
d.'y he remains in Europe.
When asked what a change in
administration might mean, he said
that the effect of a new regime
would be fell little. He said that
both parties stand much alike on
most isiites and that Republicans
would follow closely the path
mowed by Democrats.
Martin said that both parties
today are committed to a system
he called "democratic collectiv
ism.'' which offers federal pro
tection against economic and social
inequities without violating the
principle of private ownership.
Such a system, he said, "is pro
gre sive and will insure America's
democracy."
