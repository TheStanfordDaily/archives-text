# Red Cross Farm Drive Opens; Fund Need 'Especially Great'
## 
### 
The campus quota for the 1952 Red Cross fund drive, which
opened this week, has been set at $4,757. More than 100 volunteer
workers on the University stall and in the student body are cam
paigning this year.
Dr. J. P. Mitchell, Stanford emeritus registrar, professor of chem-

if.try, and chairman of the Palo Alto
Red Cross chapter, said the need for
funds is especially great this year.
''The Midwest floods depleted the
national reserves for disaster. That
one disaster has cost your Red
Cross $15,000,000," said Dr. Mitchell.
Arthur J. Cathart, Stanford alum
nus and chairman of the fund drive
for the Palo Alto area, added that
locally the goal, $5!),%0, is nearly
$10,000 above last year's quota, He
said there are several important
reasons why the need for more con
tributions has become acute.
"Our activities locally and na
tionally have been vastly enlarged,"
Cathcart said. "Chief among these
activities are the services to the
armed forces and the blood pro
gram. The blood program was not
included in the chapter's budget for
last year," he added.
Mrs. Almon F. Manspeaker, ex
ecutive director for the local Red
Cross fund drive, listed the activi
ties of the Palo Alto chapter in
seven essential service areas.
1. Home service to military men,
veterans, and their dependents.
2. The blood program.
.'{. Training programs in home
nursing, first aid, water safety, and
nutrition.
