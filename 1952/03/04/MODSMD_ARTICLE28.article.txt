WASHINGTON, March H (TTP)—Hen. Pwiqht D. Eisenhower
said today on the eve ot a House showdown on universal military
training that tiie nation has an "obligation" to train its young men
to del end themselves.
Eisenhower's views were outlined in a cablegram laid bfifore

the House by UMT backers in an
effoit to obtain approval ot the meas
ure when i! corner to a vote, possibly
tomorrow. Speaker Sam Rayburn
told President Truman today that
the vote will be "very tight."
Eisenhower's views were sought by
Hep. W Sterling Cole t'fi-N H ) and
Leroy Johnson (R-C'al > because of
what they termed the "apparent pa
thetic attitude' 1 ot some congressmen
toward UMT. They asked the Gen
eral it tie supports the bill before
the House.
The supreme Western European
commander, who is being pushed
by some k« publicans foi the GOP
presidential nomination, did not
letc-i specifically to the House
measure in his reply. But he said
"Wlnle I basically believe Chat
this kind of service is an obligation
that every citizen owes the nation
1 also believe that in reverse the
provision of training opportunity is
an obligation that the nation owes
to the individual.
"Every one of our wars has, at it?
beginning, given us reason to regret
the consequences ot committing to
emergency action units and individ
uals that have been denied oppor
tunity foi achieving complete com
petency in the use of arms "
Cole said he inteipreted Eisen
hower's statement as a specific
plea for passage of the House biii
which would make all qualified
18-year-old youths subject to six
months military ttaining followed
by 7Va yeais in the reserves.
Both supporters and critics of UMT
claim an edge of the forthcoming
voting but the balance of power is
believed to lie with some 35 to 40
Democrats listed as "undecided."
The House hopes to start voting on
the bill tomorrow when opponents
plan an immediate effort to have it
sent back to the House armed serv
ices committee Normally, such ac
tion would kill the measure at least
for this session.
