# 'Lone Woman' Rule Up for Evaluation
## 
### 
Stanford's ancient "lone woman" lule, which
prohibits women from entering men's living
groups alone at any time and for any purpose,
lias been the subject of criticism lately, from
both men and women.
The rule is constantly violated without pen
alty. Though its frequent violation in itself is
no leason to scrap the regulation, it demon
strates the rule is not taken seiiously by many
students. When it is observed, it is merely
because the rule exists, not because of any
moral considerations.
We know of no serious lepeicussions result
ing from lone Stanford women in men's living
groups, and it may well be that the rule is out
dated and unnecessary.
Chief Counselor for Women Miss Elva Brown
is not necessarily in favor of the rule. Neither
would eho suggest throwing it out without ser
jius consideration and without some view to
ward setting up a better standard in its place.
AWS is the logical body to undertake a re
consideration of the rule. The impetus should
come from Stanford's "better thud."
