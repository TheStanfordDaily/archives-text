# BULL SESSION
## One for the Freshmen 
### DICK McLEAN 
With the Great, Freshman Experience about two
thirds over 1 suspect that a lot of you have found that
college is your oyster and Stanford your pearl. But
I suspect as well that tome of you are disappointed
w'ith higher learning. You may be disappointed
about grades, about your achievements, about religion,
or just about everything in general. If so. yon are in
what is tsrmed "The Freshman Slump." The only
important aspect of this slump is not to let it tlnow

you. What you may be going
through now is normal and pretty
commonplace. In short, if you 'feel
that college has "got you 011 the
j opes," you've got and had much
company.
Let's tak a a look at the grade
situation. If you're at Stanford,
you've been used to good grades.
After four years of A's and B's in
high school, a bat eh of C's with
•n occasional D in college will

vvvukjiuii'i 1 1 ' 111 V.UI ■ *_ 'Vlil MRi|HpigHpH||HpDipßi
knock you for a loop. But here are a few facts to
console you.
At Stanford you have probably met the greatest,
intellectual competition you will ever face again. For
instanep, the average intelligence quotient here is
122-125. (The average for the country is 100). And if
you take this conglomeration of minor geniuses and
pit them one against the other in a ring called a curve,
you've got a merry old scramble.
Aha when you're in lower division, you're taking
a gi cat many courses that you don't particularly
desire. If you're not sure what you want to do, some
«'f these requirements aie a pain in the neck. (I
r.uuld name one particular requirement.) When you
if u.Epet division, you (I be taking v\ha< > 011 like,
T * hieh is in itsc't a greater stimulus <•» studying.
> ou'H also have n.;oie tune to dabble in interesting
elective?.
The la?* point about grades b this - grades don't
mean a thing. Oh, t know that when you're facinq
the abyss of minus 21, grades seem to he the most
important thing in your academic lives. But they're
not. I-earning is. When vou get along in your col
loo? career, you'll find that the getting of grades is
a science ajl its own. You learn what to .study, linw
to do it when and where to do it. (For instance, try
listening for a professor's personal I las and then
feeding it I jack to him on a test. The results arc a ma/
rp.) The day that you answe» the question, "What
did you get out of Western Civ?" with the >eply "A

lot'' instead of ' A CH ," you've really passed the
course.
Maybe you're worried about your achievements at
Stanford You may feel that you're not getting any
where. You may have been a "gun" in high school
but you're only a water pistol on the "Farm." The
place seems bis, sandstone, and cold.
Taint so. The University shrinks with every day.
Vou'il get to know tnore people as time progresses.
They, your friends, will become Stanford to you.
They will hind you more closely to school than the
Quad, Hoover Tower, or an.v of it. Why, some day
you'll be able f<» go to the Cellar stone broke and
be sure of meeting someone from whom you can
tactfully bum a rup of coffee and maybe even a
doughnut. (If it's bosom friend, you may stretch
the bonds of friendship as far as a sandwich.)
If you're interested in some activity such as the
Daily, Chappie, KZSU, Ram's Head, or Student Gov
ernment, and don't gee any progress, don't quit. Any
body who's got'-n lo the top in their field has worked
a long time, with no thanks, to l>e where he is.
Granted, eompetition is rough. As one wise coed once
. i aid, "Stanford seeks leaders. The only thins wrong
is (bat ?i succeeds. The place is full of leaders but
no followers."
The initial imp id of college sometimes levels a
mighty ram agamst your previous religious beliefs.
Tins i probably the first time in your lives that you
have faced complete objectivity as well as agnosticism
and atheism. With this assault against former values
mine freshmen are al sea for a practical philosophy
ol life This whole situation often contributes to the
tail spin
Itiit tbeie is another side to the coin. A side you
haven't fully seen yet. \ wise man once said. ''As
a little pbib> o;»by turns a man away from God.
more philosophy turns him back again." This, '
think, > » true. Western Civilization is a good course
but it fends to glw a quick once over to some pretty
.significant historical and philosophical facts. With
time and .1 diligent seeking for truth the other side
of the coin comes i'tto view.
So if you're feeling "mighty low" blame it on the
we itlici Time and a bit more livinq will probably
cine what ail . you now. Worries always seem to
mount up around finals time anyway.
So don't play Russian Roulette or join the Under
water Demolition Rcpiad. Just keep plugging. That's
the best any of its can do.

At Stanford you have probably met the greatest,
intellectual competition you will ever face again. For
instanep, the average intelligence quotient here is
122-125. (The average for the country is 100). And if
you take this conglomeration of minor geniuses and
pit them one against the other in a ring called a curve,
you've got a merry old scramble.
Aha when you're in lower division, you're taking
a gi cat many courses that you don't particularly
desire. If you're not sure what you want to do, some

the abyss of minus 21, grades seem to he the most
important thing in your academic lives. But they're
not. I-earning is. When vou get along in your col

a science ajl its own. You learn what to .study, linw
