PARIS â€” Antoine Piiuiy, a little
known independent who was minis
ter of public works in the last
I' ivncli government, struggled to
night to form a non-party emer
gency cabinet to stave oil national
economic disaster and end France's
worst postwar crisis.
Pinay "reluctantly" accepted an
invitation from President Vincent
Auriol this afternoon to try to form
a new cabinet after independent
loadei Paul Reynaud had failed to
unite right-wing Gaullists and So
cialists into a "national unity" gov
ernment.
