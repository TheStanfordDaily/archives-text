# All-Division Team Selected
## 
### DICK KLEIN Daily Sports Editor 
Two Indian players were named
to the All-Southern Division team
selected by the Daily sports .staff.
Eddie Tucker and Jim Ramstead
received the most votes and were
near - unanimous choices. Loop
champ UCLA placed smooth Jerry
Norman on the select five. Bob
Boyd of USC and Jimmy Doan of
Cal rounded out the mythical
dream team.
Although the team lacks great
height compared to most current
all-star squads, it easily makes up
for it in speed and scoring ability.
The two high - scoring centers,
Ramstead and Boyd, provide the
board control. Both are excellent
on the rebounds. The Rammer led
the loop with an average of well
over 11 rebounds per game, and

grabbed oft 2H in the season finale.
Eddie Tucker walked away with
the conference scoring record this
season and put his name solidly in
the all-time Stanford book by rack
ing up enough points to place right
behind immortal Hank Luisctti for
the most per season.
Jerry Norman, perhaps the most
flawless all - around player in the
division, led the Bruins to their
fourth straight title. A good scorer,
he was also tops on the floor. Han
dicapped by injuries throughout the
tail-end of the campaign, Doan still
rates the fifth spot. A great drib
bler and drive-in artist, Jim could
score almost any time.
Three frosh spotlight the second
All-Division team. All from dif
ferent schools, there men should
provide good nuclei for future fives.
From Stanford is the Oakland spe
cial â€” Ron Tomsic, who gave the
Cards great soring ability from way
out and plenty of hustle.
Don Bragg, UCLA forward, and
Bob McKeen, Cal's strongboy cen
ter. are the other first-year men to

make the honor. Trojan Ken Flow
er and Bruin Don Johnson are the
remaining choices.
Going out of their field a bit, the
Daily sportscribes set up an imagi
nary All - Coast quintet. Little
Johnny O'Brien of Seattle U. and
Bob Houbregs of strong Washing
ton were unanimous choices. Both
are great scorers and haven't been
effectively stopped this season.
Top nominee from the local area
was Eddie Tucker, whose great
play has earned him recognition up
and dywn the Coast. Frank Guis-,
ness of Washington and Kevin
Duggan, San Francisco State's stel-|
lar scorer, also made the Pacific
Coast all-star squad.
For laughs, the staff named an
"All-Roughie" outfit. Men named
to this team have shown plenty of
aggressiveness and fight. They are:
Bob Morton (unanimous), Ed
Simpson, Chuck O'Reilly, Jim
Walsh, and Bob Boyd.
