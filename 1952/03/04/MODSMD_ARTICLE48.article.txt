# Braves Seek Initial Win
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
Stanford's junior varsity base
ballers will attempt to halt their
three-game losing skein today as,
weather permitting, they face West
Contra Costa JC at 3:15 p.m. on the
jayvee diamond.
The Braves opened their season
last week by losing to San Mateo
JC, Mission High, and last Saturday
to Santa Rosa JC by a 12 to 3 count.
The Santa Rosans kept the Brave
batters befuddled by sending seven
pitchers to the mound, while their
mates banged out 12 safeties against
a quartet of JV hurlers. The Braves
averted a shutout when they
pushed all their tallies over in the
last two innings. Once again the
hitting star for the Braves was
third sacker Terry Evans, who
blasted out a homer and a single.
So far this year he is batting a
hefty .455.
In an effort to regain winning
ways, Coach Dick Clegg will prob
ably send Ron Boyer and lefty Ray
Highsmith to the mound today.
Both pitchers looked very good last
week, as the opposition failed to net
a tally against their offerings.
