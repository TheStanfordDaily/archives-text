# Delts Defeat Frosh Medics 33 to 24
## 
### 
Carlos Bea scored 1(5 points in
leading Delta Tau Delta to a 33-24
victory over the Frosh Medics in an
intramural basketball game last
night.
The Medics, minus Bill MeColl
tor the first time, took an early
first-half lead. However, the Delts
passed them at the ten - minute
mark, as they went ahead, 11-9. By
half-time the Delts, paced by Bea
and Bob Barley, who between them
■cored 14 first - half points, were
ahead, 18-11.
In the second half, the Medics'
Denny Tuffanelli and Bob Mclvor
sparked an early rally which
brought their quintet within two
points «rit 23-21. However, once
again Bea got hot, and, combined
,vith footballer Jack Bonetti, sent
the Delts off winging once again
and on to their final victory.
Bea, incidentally, plays basketball
on the YMI team in his spare time.
The reason is shown by the fact
that he scored just a little less
than half his team's total last night.
In another mural game last night,
Encina 2W 111 beat Village 308 by
a final score of 31-29. The Encina
team was paced by Bill Moran's 13
points.
