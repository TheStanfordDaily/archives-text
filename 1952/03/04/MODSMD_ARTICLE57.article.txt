# Stanford Biologists Plan California Gulf Expedition
## 
### DAVE WONG 
Comes March 24 and a professor and six students from the Stan
ford Biology Department will set sail from San Diego on a three
month biological investigation and exploration expedition in the
Gulf of California.
Professor William C. Steere, world-famous bryologist, will head

the Stanford group. The expedition
will visit most of the .'3B islands in
the Gulf of California as well as se
lected points on the mainland and
in Mexico. The group will be trav
eling on the research ship Orca,
which is the finest equipped labora
tory ship in the country.
The Orca is 100 feet long and
is a converted ice-breaker. It is
equipped for dredging operations
and has excellent facilities for the
research which the biologists plan
to make in fish, land plants, in
sects, reptiles, and amphibians. II
also carries harpoon guns, 12
small boats, and two motor
launches.
The expedition is being made in
co-operation with the Mexican gov
ernment and is sponsored by the
Sefton Research Foundation. The
Foundation is headed by J. W. Sef
ton Jr., a Stanford graduate who
played in the first Rose Bowl game
in 1902.
Duplicate collections of specimens
will be made and one of the collec
tions will be deposited at the Na
tional Museum of Mexico.
The students from Stanford
who are going on the trip are
George E. Lindsay, botanist; J.
M. Savage, herpetologist; Frank
S. Cliff, herpetologist; John I'.
Figg-Hoblyn, entomologist: James
E. Bolke, ichthyologist; and Dan
M. Cohen, ichthyologist.
In addition to the Stanford group,
Dr. Reid Moran, a botanist from
Cornell University, and Professor
Maximino Martinez, a botanist from
the Instituto Biolociico, National

University of Mexico, will also be
along.

Comes March 24 and a professor and six students from the Stan
ford Biology Department will set sail from San Diego on a three
month biological investigation and exploration expedition in the
Gulf of California.
Professor William C. Steere, world-famous bryologist, will head

the Stanford group. The expedition
will visit most of the .'3B islands in
the Gulf of California as well as se
lected points on the mainland and
in Mexico. The group will be trav
eling on the research ship Orca,
which is the finest equipped labora
tory ship in the country.
The Orca is 100 feet long and
is a converted ice-breaker. It is
equipped for dredging operations
and has excellent facilities for the
research which the biologists plan
to make in fish, land plants, in
sects, reptiles, and amphibians. II
also carries harpoon guns, 12
small boats, and two motor
launches.
The expedition is being made in
co-operation with the Mexican gov
ernment and is sponsored by the
Sefton Research Foundation. The
Foundation is headed by J. W. Sef
ton Jr., a Stanford graduate who
played in the first Rose Bowl game
in 1902.
Duplicate collections of specimens
will be made and one of the collec
tions will be deposited at the Na
tional Museum of Mexico.
The students from Stanford
who are going on the trip are
George E. Lindsay, botanist; J.
M. Savage, herpetologist; Frank
S. Cliff, herpetologist; John I'.
Figg-Hoblyn, entomologist: James
E. Bolke, ichthyologist; and Dan
M. Cohen, ichthyologist.
In addition to the Stanford group,
Dr. Reid Moran, a botanist from
Cornell University, and Professor
Maximino Martinez, a botanist from
the Instituto Biolociico, National

University of Mexico, will also be
along.


SHIP AHOY —The 100-foot Orca, which means "Killer Whale,"
will take a group of biologists on a three-month biological expe
dition in the Gulf of California. They are expected to conclude
their work by June 15.
