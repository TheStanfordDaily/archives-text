## Lease Signed On 15Â½ Acres Here 
### 
Completion of plans for the first
public subdivision development on
Stanford lands was announced yes
terday by the University and the
Peninsula Paci 112 i c Construction
Company.
A 99-year lease of 15V> acres on
a tract across San Francisquito
Creek from the fourth tee of tin
Stanford golf course, near the in
tersection of Alameda de las Pul
gas and Portola Road, was signed
by the construction company.
Harry L. Arnold, company presi
dent, said that another 10 days will
be required before the company
will be ready to talk to prospective
buyers, but that he hopes to start
construction of 45 homes in the
tract by April 1.
The homes will mostly be in the
three-, four-, and five-bedroom
class, wtih prices expected to run
$25,000 and up on the current mar
ket, although Arnold said a few
two-bedroom homes would be built
on special request.
The lots range from a fourth to
a third of an acre.
The lease arrangement, common in
the East and in Hawaii, is unusual
in California. All private homes on
the Stanford campus are con
structed under a lease arrangement.
Plans for the new subdivision,
another step in the University's
program of development of its un
used land, were first announced in
April last year. At the same time
the University disclosed that it had
agreed to a friendly condemnation
suit to permit the Menlo Park Ele
mentary School District Board to
acquire eight and a half adjoining
acres of the tract as a site for a
new elementary school. This school
is now under construction.
