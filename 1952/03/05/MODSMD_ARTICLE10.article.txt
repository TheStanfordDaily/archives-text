# DAILY POLITICAL POLL
## Ike Is Top-Heavy Choice To Take Presidential Race 
### HADLEY ROFF 
If Stanford students rellect the political attitudes of the general
public, then General Dwight Eisenhower will be the next President
of the United States.
By a two to-one margin, the more than 200 students polled at
random by Daily reporters this past week named Eisenhower as

the man who will next occupy the"
White House.
Only 38 p»'i- cent of the students,
however, stuck by the general when
asked who should he the next Pres
ident. Many students felt a dark
hone candidate to be better quali
fied.
Three questions were asked in
the poll. A break-down of answers
follows:

The poll obviously confirmed that
Stanford students have Republican
leanings.
The students apparently picked
Eisenhower for the White House
job not because of any sterling
qualities, but rather because he is
"the best man there is."
Most of the answers given in
the poll were couched in negative
terms us students weeded out
disagreeable points in candidates'
platforms and decided that "Ei
senhower is the most politically
inoffensive candidate."
Frequently during the polling,
students would shrug and shake
their heads saying, "Who else is
j there but the general?"
One student admitted that he
! selected Eisenhower liv a "proc
ess of elimination. I know Taft,
| Truman, and all the others and I
feel Ike would be the best."
Answers gathered from the 212
students questioned show that few
actually know where Eisenhower
stands on domestic and foreign is
sues. They merely hope "he is a
leader of men."
Some students said they would
support Senator Robert A. Taft for
the Presidency if he altered his
foreign policy. Students felt that
the Senator's policy was reaction
[ ary. Some felt that his stand on
| Asia "would lead to war."
The students who thought Taft
would be elected said the Senator
; proved himself "a great states
i man" in Congress. Taft support -
! ers claimed that his outspoken
stand on issues would insure his
election.
In the poll, however, only 30 stu
dents envisioned a Democratic vic
tory this year. These students said
the Democrats would again win be
cause "they are offering more things
' to a larger majority, and the people
i like what they are offering."
Though no hope was held for
I their nomination, several promi
nent legislators and juiists among
Democratic ranks were named as
men "who should be President."
Seven students said they would
immediately support Senator Paul
Douglas (D., III.), whom they called
i a great liberal. Eleanor Roosevelt
| was suggested as another "liberal"
who would make an "outstanding
President." William Douglas and
' Hugo Black, both Justices of the
i j Supreme Court were also sug-
I gp^ted.
