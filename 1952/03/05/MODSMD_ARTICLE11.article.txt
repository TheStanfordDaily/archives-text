# Lone Woman Rule Called Unrealistic
## 
### 
The "lone woman" rule problem
was aired Monday night by a rep
resentative group 11 oni student
governing committees, and action
referred to tin* Fundamental Stand
ard Committee and the Social Reg
illations Committee of AVVS.
The rule, which states a woman
can enter a men's living group only
if accompanied by another woman,
has been under criticism lately and
in many areas.
The meeting was called in order
to plan and channel definite action
toward solving the ''lone woman"
rule problem. Excom, AWS, Fun
damental Standard Committee, So
cial Regulations Committee, Men's
and Women's Council, and Dean of
Men Richard L. Balch composed the
group.
l>ick Klein expressed the view
j of Fundamental Standard Com-
I inittee that the rule is not obeyed,
j unrealistic, and weakens tin- Fun
damental Standard as a whole.
Because it is unrealistic, student
groups have had to refer infrac
tions to the administration, there
by weakening student govern
ment ami pleasing neither stu
dents nor, according to Balrh, the
administration.
Strict enforcement of the rule as
it now stands means support by the
entire campus, which at present is
obviour.ly lacking, Betty Lou Edson
of Women's Council pointed out.
Klein said his committee favored
a general policy of social conduct to
govern all behavior in all areas,
with specific i ules in areas such as
liquor and the lone woman prob
lems. 11 lite rule is to be modified,
the group decided, concrete sug
gestions should accompany the ar
j lion.
Balch said lie thought (he prob
lem involves more than the "lone
woman" situation and is a ques
' tion of basic responsibility which
j the women would have to assume
if the rule is modified.
Miss Edson also mentioned that
the rule seemed clear to students
as freshmen, but later In came
ha/y, indicating that either clari
fication or complete le-evaluution
and modification of Ihc rule is
mcessary.

of Women's Council pointed out.
Klein said his committee favored
a general policy of social conduct to
govern all behavior in all areas,
with specific i ules in areas such as
liquor and the lone woman prob
lems. 11 lite rule is to be modified,
the group decided, concrete sug
gestions should accompany the ar
j lion.
Balch said lie thought (he prob
lem involves more than the "lone
woman" situation and is a ques
' tion of basic responsibility which
j the women would have to assume
if the rule is modified.
Miss Edson also mentioned that
the rule seemed clear to students
as freshmen, but later In came
ha/y, indicating that either clari
fication or complete le-evaluution
and modification of Ihc rule is
mcessary.
