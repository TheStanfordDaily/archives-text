### PETE GROTHE 
Frank Novak, the pressman who does the graveyard
: hiti printing the Dailys. was standing in front of the
Daily Shack. It was 4:30 in the morning, arid the sun
waj casting its first pale glow 011 the foothill:, in the
northwest. Frank, a cigarette hanging from the cor
ner of his mouth, stood there in the pre-dawn silence,
thinking vacant thoughts.
A car, pushing another car down the road, inter
rupted Frank's thoughts.
"Hmmm," said Frank to himself, "someone must
have a dead battery."
It wasn't time for Frank to return to the pr Coj yet,
so he lit another cigarette.
Another car, pushing still another car, chugged
down the road.

"Wei), whattayaknow," mur
mured Frank. "Someone else
must have a dead battery."
No sooner had Frank said this
when still another two-car pro
c ?ssion came around the corner,
and then another and another and
another.
"Holy Cow!" holy cowed Frank.
"How can there be this many
dead batteries on campus?"
And still they kept coming. By

the time the fifteenth auto came oown tne street
pushing the fifteenth "dead battery" car, Frank's eyes
were out on stems.
"This," profounded Frank, "is more than a coinci
dence."
By the time the thirtieth pushed-car passed, Frank
rushed to a phone to call the police. "L-l-look,"
stuttered Frank, "the biggest car steal in California's
history is taking place right here on the Stanford
campus. I just counted 30 cars being pushed away!"
' I know,"the voice at the other end of the line
cooly informed him. "It's a fraternity prank, Frank,
end as a matter of fact, one of the officers is directing

all the traffic into the parking lot near the chemistry
budding."
"Oh," Frank allowed.
tic hung up the phone, muttered something about
"these damn college kids," and went back to the
press to continue printing the Dailys.

ALERT TRACK COACH DEPT. A Stanford stu
dent, whom we'll call Bob, wrote his girl friend that
lie wouldn't be able to go home to visit her last week
end, because Stanford had a track meet he wanted
to see.
Of course, Stanford had no track meet last week
end, and the girl, suspecting that her one and only
was telling a tall fib. wrote the athletic department,
asking for the schedule of track meets. She was
ashamed to sign her own name, so she signed her
brother's.
A few days Jater, received a letter from track
coach Jack Weicrshauser. Enclosed was the schedule
and a letter saying, "Please send mc your events and
best times."

Rod Garner, center on the grid squad and more
recently a heavyweight wrestler, had some difficulty
winning the Cal match—a match that he easily should
have won.
Reason ' Phi! Wilson, lire other heavyweight, was
scheduled to meet the Bear grunt and groaner, but
came down with poison oak and couldn't wrestle.
Garner, not knowing this, went out to Rossotti's, had
about a quart and-a-half of beer, and ate a gigantic
dinner afterwards.
Nod wasn't in the best of shape for the match.
IT'S JUNIOR PROM TIME. Word has it that the
Junior Prom should be the best dance of the year.
This bein-j leap year, chairman Garner Beckett em
phasizes that it is perfectly proper for A girl to ask
the boy. Tickets arc going fast, so get yours soon.
See ya there.

Another car, pushing still another car, chugged

history is taking place right here on the Stanford
campus. I just counted 30 cars being pushed away!"
