## 'Slums' in Stern and Crothers 
### 
To the Editor:
I have come to the conclusion that most Stanford
men live like animals. Take a look at the dormitories
end you will find the walls covered with junk, the
beds unmade, books and papers scattered over the
desks and chairs, and clothes piled everywhere.
Few Universities can boast of such tine buildings as
Stern and Crothers, but their inhabitants have turned

them into slums. Perhaps the Student Councils
could investigate the matter with the possible course
of an occasional room inspection.
However, I have no doubts that this is one reform
that has no hope at Stanford, but at least poverty
cannot he used as the excuse. As for the numerous
offenders, I wish them God Speed into Universal
Military Training.
