# Poloists Play in New York
## Cards to Play In Invitation Tournament 
### JOHANNE MARTZ 
For the first time in the history
of polo at Stanford, the Stanford
j team has been invited to compete
| in the Intercollegiate Indoor Polo
j Tournament which is played annu
ally at the Squadron A Armory in
New York City.
Stanford drew a bye in the first
round and will compete against
Princeton in the semi-finals tomor
row. Princeton topped Cornell in
the first round, and Yale beat Har
vard. New Mexico Military Insti
tute also drew a bye in the first
I round.
Saturday, the winner of the Stan
ford-Princeton game will meet the
winner of the NMMI-Yale game in
the finals to determine the Inter
| collegiate Indoor Champion.
Allan Scherer, three-goal star and
! captain of the Stanford team, is the
! only team member who has played
J regulation indoor polo. Neither
Alex Echavarria nor Karl Walter,
president of the Stanford Polo As
sociation, has played indoor. Al
though this Stanford team has nev
er played indoor, articles in several
New York papers have called Stan
ford "the team to beat."
Indoor polo differs from outdoor
in several respects: (1) There are
three instead of four men on an
indoor team. (2) An inflated leather
ball about five inches in diameter is
used in place of the small willow
outdoor ball. (3) The game is played
in four instead of six chukkers on
a dirt area which is roughly a third
the size of an outdoor field. (4) The
rules vary in respect to fouls and
j penalties.
The Intercollegiate Committee of
the United States Indoor Polo Asso
ciation sponsors the meet and do
nates the horses. The same horses
are used in every match so no team
has a substantial horse advantage
over another team.


GOAL IN SIGHT—Card polo player Karl Walter gets off a Heck
shot as he is checked by Alex Echavarria. The Stanford polo
team travels to New York to play in the National Invitational Polo
Tournament this week.
