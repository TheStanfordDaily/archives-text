The Stern II basketball team,
display ing form seldom seen in in
lamuaral play, soundly walloped a
hij'.'ily rated Stern IV team Monday

League VI championship.
The perform:',nee definitely places
the Stern men in high contention
lor the 1952 intramural basketball
crown and as one of the "teams to
.veat."

over previously unbeaten Stern
IV, lite Slcrn II quintet got off
(<> a lav( starl, never were in any
kind rf trouble duritv* (he game,
and showed marvelous team play j
ami uncanny shooting ability.
I -ed I ly fj—ft. o-in. forward Rae

had a .485 shooting percentage dur
ing the game and had control of
bolli boards. Forward George Shott,

boards, Jerry Bloch and Bob Worth,
a pair of guards from New York,

passes. Stern II also has good depth,
as 6-ft. o-in. Bob Merrick and (>-ft.
4-in. Jay Canel. a transfer from
