# Church Library Is Expanded
## 
### SARA PACKARD 
1
One of the foremost of its kind
in the country, the Memorial
Church vestry library offers in
tellectual and religious stimula
tion to students of all denomina
tions.
Such current titles as the biog
raphy of Mary Baker Eddy and
Herberg's "Judaism and the Modern
Man" are among the current religious
! literature, besides such secular nov
els as "Kon Tiki" and"The Picture
of Dorian Grey." Philosophy books
by Spinoza, Erasmus, and Thomas
| More are also included in the list.
An outstanding periodical selec
tion which represents varieties of
! faiths constitutes another section of
the library. Other types of magazines
such as the "Atlantic Monthly," "Il
lustrated London News," and "Ari
zona Highways" are also available.
Besides religion, philosophy, and
! history majors, many other students
have found the library helpful and
interesting. An average of twenty
enthusiasts check out books dady.
Books may be borrowed for the
regular two week period and during
vacations.
The vestry library has expanded
greatly in the past few quarters.
Once a few shelves in the reverend's
office, the collection is now lodged
in a separate room and consists of
numerous volumes. Easy chairs
and studying tables are provided for
the reader's comfort.
The central site of the University
was, at one time, suggested for a
library. It was only through strong
opposition of the founders that Me
morial Church stands in its stead.
Now, with the new church library,
both ideas have been fulfilled.
