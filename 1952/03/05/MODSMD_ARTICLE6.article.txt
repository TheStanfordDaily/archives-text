# Yugoslavia Is Not Red Slave, Bryan Reports
## 
### HARRY GLEAZE 
Tito's Yugoslavia is not such a
sore spot us we might think.
This is the view Julien Bryan
expressed with words and pictures
in a film - lecture at last night's
Tuesday Evening Series program.
Ife went, into the heart of Yugosla- !
via last summer to take color mov- j
ies ol the lives of the people in j
country and city as well as pictures j
of Marshal Tito and his staff.
Bryan explained that we are J
forced to accept Tito's government,
but by the help ol the United Na- '
tions and education and aid from j
the United States concerning the j
Western world we can have an ally j
in Yugoslavia. Since the break ]
with Stalin in 194(! the name of the
Russian dictator is now no longer
heard.
"Tito broke to save his own
scalp," said Bryan. "Otherwise
there would have been new inter- I
nal revolts. The Yugoslavian peo
ple have a much warmer affection
for Americans than we think," he j
continued.
The scenes in Yugoslavia were j
vivid in color and meaning—docu
mentary rather than travelogue.
They showed a nation —modern in
many ways—trying to improve its
lot. Bryan explained that Commu
nism is not quite as rampant as we
think because in many instances it
just does not work.
Bryan will show a psychological
film, "The Fears of Children," at
4:15 in Cubberley Auditorium to
day. The movie is of special inter
est to education students.
