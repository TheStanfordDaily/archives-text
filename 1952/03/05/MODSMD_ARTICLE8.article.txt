# Players' First Aim Is Experience
## Group Offers Community Plays of Past and Present 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
"An organization of service to students and to the entire Stan
ford community" is A. Nicholas Vardac's description of the Stan
ford Players, currently producing "Desire Under the Elms" tomor
row, Friday, and Saturday.
Vardac, one of the directors of the Players' productions, ex-

♦
ulty assisting only when help or ad
vice is needed or requested.
The second goal of the Stanford
Players. Vardac said, is "to bring
to the Stanford community sig
nificant plays of past and present."
The Players have produced such
classics as "Othello," "The, Ores
teia," "Macbeth," and in the mod
ern repertoire such recent New
York hits as "Desire Under the
Kims," "'Hie Madwoman of C'lia
illot." and "Boy Meets (;irl."
Plays have been presented rang
ing from such expressionistic dra
mas as "The Adding Machine" to
the modern realism of "Of Mice and
Men," to the romantic comedies of
Shakespeare, and to the austere
classicism of the Greek drama. New
I plays have been presented on vari
i ous occasions.
To their production of plays, the
Players frequently bring profes
sional players from stefje and
screen. Two kinds of guest ar
tists are featured in Player pro
ductions: senior artists - in - resi
dence and junior artists-in-resi
dence. The former are profes
sionals, while the latter are tal
ented young actors deemed wor
| tin of encouragement in their
chosen profession.
Senior guest artists are usually
j called upon to interpret roles nor
mally beyond students' grasp. Such
a role was that of Shylock, por
trayed by Clarence Derwent in the
recent production of "The Merchant
of Venice." Other guest artists in
this category who have appeared
with tli- Stanford Player, include

plained further the aims and or-*
ganization of the Stanford Players,
the group which produces all Uni
versity dramatic presentations oth
er than Ram's Head productions. |
Tryouts for productions are open
to anyone in the Stanford Univer
sity family.
The first aim of the Stanford
Players is to provide practical ex- [
perience for students in the techni- i
cal phases of dramatic productions |
and also to give them a chance to j
act in and to see live drama. Stu- j
dents may gain experience in acting,
directing, lighting, and costuming,
as well as in scenic work. All work
must measure up to the professional
standards set by the Drama Depart
ment faculty.
In main stage productions, fac
111i> members are in charge of all
major departments such as light
ing, directing, costuming, and
scenery, witli students working in
an associate capacity, tluis "learn
ing while actually doing" accord
ing to Vardac. The ratio on the
"Desire" production of four fac
ulty members to approximately
511 students reveals how extensive
student participation in the busi
ness of getting the show ready
can lie.
In contrast to the presentations of t
the Stanford Players, Studio Tliea- '
ter productions are normally done
entirely by graduate students, who
have first prepared all production
plans with a faculty member. In
these presentations, all work con
nected with the performance is
dune by tin.* tudent ;. with the fac-

Jessica Tandy, Jane Harwell, Aline
MacMahon, and Hume Cronyn.
Junior artists arc students select -
ed in a nationwide competition and
brought to the University on a
fellowship lor acting, designing,
lighting, or technical woik. Many
ot these students enter the profes
sional theater either m Hollywood
or New York.
One ■ uch re,put ca ;p was that of

' Seymour Tuchow, 21 - year - old
j Stanford student who wa.s testei
and put in the second lead ol "The
Enforcers" with Humplney tiogart
after having hi name changed t<
j Larry Tolan. The talent scout raver
about his new discovery, calling
him "fabulous" and "a most elec
tric personality " Tolan is at pres
ent hard at woik making films ii
I Hollywood.
