Stanford Memorial Chapel this Sun
day.
And that will he only one of the j
highlights of Founder's Day.

author will make the sermon ad

of Crisis." Herbert's special field
is social philosophy and Christian
theology, lie is (he author of the
hist selling "Judaism and Modern
Man"—said by Ueinhold Nichuhr
to i>e a "landmark in American
religious thought."
Student body president Wayne

will march in the processional and
recessional parades. Among the
emeritus faculty who are expected
to participate are a few who served

Founded in 188!), Stanford was

opened in 1891 with an enrollment
of 559 students—39 more than the
University of California registered
in the fall of the same year.
Leland Stanford—United States
Senator, president of the first
transcontinental railroad, and Civil
War governor of California—died
less than two years after the uni
versity named for his son was
opened.
The Senator's energy, interest, and
wealth, erected the university but
it was his wife Jane Stanford's faith
and selflessness that kept it going
during the long years of financial
difliculty and legal entanglements
that followed her husband's death.
Memorial Church the scene of the
commemoration of Founder's Day
this Sunday — was built by Mrs.
Stanford as a memorial to her hus
band.
