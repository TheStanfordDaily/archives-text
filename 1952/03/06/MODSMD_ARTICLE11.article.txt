# Curtain Goes Up Tonight On 'Desire Under the Elms'
## 
### 
Tonight at 8:15 the moving
tragedy "Desire Under the Elms"
by Eugene O'Neill, will be pre
sented by the Stanford Players
on the stage of Memorial Audi
torium.
Starring Hal Burdick Sr. as Eph
raim Cabot, MargaitH McKenna as
Abbie, his wife, anil Hon Hayes as
Eben, his son, the drama unfolds in
a New England homestead around
the year 1850. The story is of Abbie
and Eben's love for each other, their
son, and the tragic results of Abbie's
smothering the child to regain Eben's
love.
"Desire" was recently revived in
New York, as was "Anna Christie'"
another of O'Neill's plays. The
author of such dramas as "Morning
Becomes Mleetra" and"The Great

God Brown," O'Neill lias won three
Pulitzer prizes for his powerful
plays.
The set for the Player's production
of "Desire," designed by Wendell
Cole, brings out the importance of
the farm and the surrounding lands
to the play. The use of a complete
skeleton house, thus enabling the
audience to catch action going on at
the same time in different places,
gives a three-dimerisional effect to
the proceedings.
Director of the play is A. Nicho
las Vardac, with Virginia Opsvig
in charge of the costumes and Del
ford Brummer taking care of all
lighting arrangements. Hoed owners
will do the dance sequence in "De
sire."
Subsequent performances of "De
sire Under the Elms" will be given
tomorrow and Saturday.
