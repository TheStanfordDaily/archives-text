# Bright 'Lite' In Dead Week
## 
### 
What happea*; when "Lite" hits
Stanford?
Wednesday, March 12, the Old
Boy will appear with his annual
parody issue. Among its other fea
tures, "Lite" will present a three
page History of Western Civiliza
tion since the beginning of time.
All you Civ students might, find it
helpful when exam time rolls
around.
"Lite's" review of the Movie of
th Week will deal with "The Col
lege Terrace Mob," and there will
be a feature on "Artists of Our
Time."
"Lite" will sell for 30 cents, and
since demand for the parody issue
always exceeds supply, get yours
early!
