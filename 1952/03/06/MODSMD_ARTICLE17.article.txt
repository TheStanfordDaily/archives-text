## 
### 
When ll 10 second Model United Nations conference opens it'"
three-day session at (JSC on April 3, Stanford will he thereâ€”this
time playing the role of the United States.
Last year the first western "mock" UN conference was held
here at Stanford when Ralph Bunche, noted (IN leader, acted as

"mediator. At this conference Stan
ford represented the Russian dt le
gation. Last year's conference was
termed a great success and has sup
plied the inspiration for the planning
ot a second conference.
Ted Collier and George Velliofes
are the co-chairmen of Stanford's
delegation. The lull delegation it
self will have 12 members.
Four or five other students are ex
pected lu travel south with the dele
gation as observers. The final selec
tions of the deelgation members have
not yet been made.
The mock delegations will emulate
as closely as possible the stands ihe
countries they represent would ac
tually take. For the past month
Stanford's tentative delegation mem
bers have been doing research on
America's United Nations' policy
and on the international problems
which will be put to their consider
ation and decision at the conference.
Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, "first
lady of the United Nations" is ex
pected to give an address at the
opening session of the conference.
She has recently returned from a
IJN General Assembly meeting in
Paris followed by a world tour and
will give the student delegates a
first hand impression of the fight
for human rights as she has ob
served it in theory in the UN and
in practice throughout the world.
Although 200 western colleges have
been invited to participate in the
conference, only 60 will be able to
represent nations as this in the actual
number ot member nations in the
UN.
The purpose of the Model UN is
educational. Jerome Harris, con
ference director, and senior at USC
stales, "We are combining theory
with practice in learning the make
up, problems, and attributes of the
vehicle we call the United Nations.
We will become more familiar with
Ihe techniques in its handling
world problems."
The conference will be televised
and covered by Life Magazine.
