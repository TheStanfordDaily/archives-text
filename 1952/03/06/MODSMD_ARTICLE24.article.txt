"To be a person is to have a God."
So spoke Will Herbert*, philoro
pher and theologion, in his fir t dis
cussion on "Religious Presupposi
tions in the Natural Sciences" Tues
day afternoon in the Women's Club
house.
Herberg explained that science
must make presuppositions before
it can operate. Among them are:
the reality of the external world;
the possibility of attaining valid
and stable knowledge of the exter
nal world; the uniformity of na
ture; the idea that a scientific en
terprise is something worth while;
and the belief that science is au
tonomous.
These factors are literally pre
suppositions. They are unprovable
but also irrefutable. To attempt to
prove them would lead to an invalid
circular proof which uses the pre
suppositions themselves. .
What happens when these factors
are made end;; in themselves is ap
parent. Nature becomes "full of
gods" and leads to Greek panthe
ism. As such it woidd be impious
to investigate nature and science
would be impossible.
To make the other points ultimate
in themselves would le:nd to similar

conclusions. Nothing would be for
bidden science. Thus is not so in
the modern world.
"The presupposition that natural
science is an absolute leads to an
adulterous, pantheistic religion,"
said Herberg. "It (science) is kept
in check by an ultimate beyond
this world."
It follows that the world is real
but it is not all. It is impossible to
be relative to things in this world
without an absolute beyond this
world.
"If there is no transcendent point
of reference, then man will take
wliat is most precious and make it
absolute." To sum up, Herberg said,
"These presuppositions must be im
bedded in religious context. There
is either an adulterous or a trans
cendent reference. There is no third
choice."
Besides being a lecturer, Will
Herberg has been active in both
labor and social research. He is a
director of research in a large AFL
labor union, He has wiitten widely
in both fields as well as on his main
interest, religion. His most recent
book, "Judaism and Modern Man:
An Interpretation of Jewish Reli
gion," is presently displayed at the
Bookstore.
