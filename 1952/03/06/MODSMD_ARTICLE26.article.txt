# Excom Votes Approval Of Non-Partisan Plan
## Board of Trustees to Consider Proposals at March 20 Meeting 
### 
Cxcom last night unanimously approved the netting up of a non
partisan political club headed J>y a student faculty committee to
increase Stanford's political consciousness. Details of the by
laws will be worked out later.

I lie vole of approval, along with a tentative net of by laws for
the club, will be referred to the Board of Ti usteos at their March 20

mot |iup. If the board favors the
propo al, il can (hen liberalize its
former stand of no political ac
tivity on campus.
The Political Education Commit
tee ieeommended the club and stu
dent faculty board over four other
alternatives: a student - faculty
board hy itself, a political club
headed by an all-student board, a
union of partisan political commit
tees, and separate political praty
groups.
Committee member Jack Fra
ser emphasized that the club is a
flexible uiraugenipnt which will
allow for changes as Ihe campus
becomes moif politically con
scious. IiÂ»- explained that the
committee felt die non-partsian,
board - controlled arrangement
would be the best political organi
zation at this time.
Everett Claik, Political Educa
tion Committee chairman, explained
that faculty were included in the
recommended board in order to en
li-1 their co-operation in planning
political programs and to bettpr
student-faculty relations.

The Political Education Com
mittee will hold a public hearing
on the by-law"; for the proposed
non-partisan political club from
4:39 ii> 5:3(1 p.m. today in the
Student Manager's oftice.

According to the committee's
recommendation, the board head
ing the club would be made up of
three faculty members appointed by
the administration and five students
appointed originally by an Excom
interviewing committee. In follow
ing years, the chairman of the
board, an outgoing board member,
and an Excom representative would
name the board. The appointments
would be subject to Excom's ap
proval.
An attempt would be made to
keep the board balanced politi
cally, Jackson fxplained. How
ever, a rigid party latio would
not be set up. Instead, the in
terviewers would he cautioned
not to pick ali three Democrats
w Republicans, tor example.
Open lo all student body mem
bers, the elub itself woidd carry on
the .'uiiial work of putting on a
political education program which
would include rueh things as
speeches and discussion groups, and
performing ruch political services as
giving information about registra
tion.
