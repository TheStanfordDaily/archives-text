# Provost—Sharing the Burden
## 
### 
Dr. Douglas M Whitaker will tdke over a new
and significant University post April 1, that of
University Provost.
liis job will be to put a shoulder under the
heavy load now being carried almost single
handedly by President Sterling.
The provost idea is not unique at Stanford.
Many universities of similar size and complex
ity have an arrangement where a high ranking
officer shares the tremendous administrative
burden that goes with the presidency of a uni
versity.
And there is no doubt that the responsibili
ties, the amount of sheer work and careful
planning, the co-ordination and adjustment of
emphasis among University departments and
functions, and the problem of finance, all con
stitute a task of almost overwhelming propor
tions.
Dr. Whitaker, who will assume some of the
burden, is a man who knows Stanford, lfe was
raised on campus, the son of a professor. He
knows students and ho knows the faculty.
Whitaker was graduated from Stanford in
1926. He received his Ph D here in 1928 and be
came a member of the faculty in 1931. In lune
last year he was appointed Dean of the Faculty
of Humanities and Sciences, the largest single
accdemic unit of the University.
What Whitaker's new post will do for Presi

dent Sterling is important. The president should
be released in terras of time, energy, and re
sponsibility from a lot of the labor he now must
tackle.
We've often heard students say they feel
they don't really know the president. This
comes not in way of criticism. Most students
no doubt are aware of the situation and real
he it is not the president's choice it he is un
able to spend mere time with students.
Dr. Whitaker's appointment should free the
president for such contact.
We know the president has a big job. But we
like to feel there is more than just sentiment
to the concept of the "Stanford family." And
wc like to feel there is some truth to the state
ment that Stanford is a small school with big
opportunities; that close personal relations
among all segments of the family—students,
faculty, and alumni—are not lost sight of, large
as the University may be in terms of facilities
and advantages.
We hav«s a suggestion:
II the president were to address the student
body once or twicc a year in a sort ol "State
of the University" message, we feel student
dissatisfaction about "not knowing the presi
dent" would larqely disappear.
Perhaps Dr. Whitaker's new post will make
such contact possible.
