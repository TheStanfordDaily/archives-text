# BULL SESSION
## Roundup Time... 
### DICK McLEAN 
Well it's about that time, "Roundup Time nn the
Farm." About once every ten weeks we count up
the livestock and see how we've done T, for one, was
planning to bring in a fine fold of A's with a few
spotted B's to prove that I had some fun. But as 1
survey the herd as it stampedes toward me. all I can

spy are some ornery C's. (I'm
hoping that these poor old eyes
are just tired from the long ride
but there could be a stray D with
my brand on its flank. Hear flank,
that is.)
But it's been a good quarter
all in all. I met a lot, of nice Stan
ford girls. But I didn't marry any
of them. No siree. I'm not ready
to bring home the bacon yet.
(Get it?) If not, tead the line

over several times and ask yourself, ' From what ani
mal does bacon come?" If you still don't, ask your
mother. If she's a Stanford woman and rightly sen
sitive, duck.
(Truly sorry about the above paragraphs.
But it's late at night and I'm punchy. I'll
f.tarl again.)
Remember at the beginning of the quarter in my
list of resolutions when I said that I wasn't going to
listen to any more stories from the late-daters? That
resolution went the way of all resolutions—onto paper
and out of mind. But anyway, a rather amusing in
cident occurred in one of these pre-clawn bull session;;.
A two-thirty trooper dragged himself into my room
and plunked down heavily in the overstuffed chair.
"Got a smoke?" he wheezed
"Sure," I ;aid and gave him one. The kid looked
fired. His eyes glowed a uniform i»«»»k. his cheeks
blushed a delicate tuschia, he was smeared with
a razzberry colored substance from ear <<> ear. He
looked like a man who's battled his way lo first place
in a watermelon mating contest.
"Thanks," he said. But there was something wrong
with him. He w-isn't, his usual jollv self Wo snappy
sayings. No quick comeback. I uoticcd that his hands
trembled as he succeeded in his third attempt to 1 low
out the match.
"Something wrong, boy?" 1 asked in a fatherly
tone.

''Yeah," he said with a heavy sigh, "my girl is
getting pinned "
"Gee but that's really tough. Really tough, kid,"
I said. (What else can you say?) This hit of news
floored inc. I thought she was mad for him. Every
time I saw the two together, she flashed that mother
cobra look in her eye.
"Can't you talk her out of it?" I said.
''Nope, she's made up her mind."
"Isn't there anything you can do?"
" 'Fraid not."
"Well you'll just have to kiss her of! and look for
greener pastures."
"You don't understand," he said with a thin,
pained look in his eye, "she getting pinned to me."

Whatever happened to the time? It seems as if
the quarter just begins and then it's finals time.
But I've got a meat idea. Why not have finals at the
beginning of the quarter instead of at the end?
In the second week of the quarter everyone is tan,
and smiling, and rested. Nobody's worried. That's
the time when people should have finals. As it. is
now, the student body is so exhausted from parties
and skiing and Friday afternoons that they naturally
crack under the pressure.
People who visit Stanford in the early pari of the
quarter think that this is tlie best party school on
the coast. For right weeks it's I,eland Stanford
Junior Country Club. Then suddenly, a grim tense
ness settles on the campus. No dales for anyone.
The library is jammed, Rossotti's closes. The rcsl
home fills with hysterical patients. Indeed, Ihe smile
is gone from our campus.
And why? Why this unnecessary bloodshed? The
answer is that finals come at the worst time in the
whole ten week:;. It's eight, weeks of fun and two
week:, of hell no matter how you slice it. So why not
get the unpleasant stuff out of the way and get down
to the real purpose of college—fun.

the livestock and see how we've done T, for one, was
planning to bring in a fine fold of A's with a few
spotted B's to prove that I had some fun. But as 1
survey the herd as it stampedes toward me. all I can

spy are some ornery C's. (I'm
hoping that these poor old eyes
are just tired from the long ride
but there could be a stray D with
my brand on its flank. Hear flank,
that is.)
But it's been a good quarter
all in all. I met a lot, of nice Stan
ford girls. But I didn't marry any
of them. No siree. I'm not ready
to bring home the bacon yet.
(Get it?) If not, tead the line

over several times and ask yourself, ' From what ani
mal does bacon come?" If you still don't, ask your
mother. If she's a Stanford woman and rightly sen
sitive, duck.
(Truly sorry about the above paragraphs.
But it's late at night and I'm punchy. I'll
f.tarl again.)
Remember at the beginning of the quarter in my
list of resolutions when I said that I wasn't going to
listen to any more stories from the late-daters? That
resolution went the way of all resolutions—onto paper
and out of mind. But anyway, a rather amusing in
cident occurred in one of these pre-clawn bull session;;.
A two-thirty trooper dragged himself into my room
and plunked down heavily in the overstuffed chair.
"Got a smoke?" he wheezed
"Sure," I ;aid and gave him one. The kid looked
fired. His eyes glowed a uniform i»«»»k. his cheeks
blushed a delicate tuschia, he was smeared with
a razzberry colored substance from ear <<> ear. He
looked like a man who's battled his way lo first place
in a watermelon mating contest.
"Thanks," he said. But there was something wrong
with him. He w-isn't, his usual jollv self Wo snappy
sayings. No quick comeback. I uoticcd that his hands
trembled as he succeeded in his third attempt to 1 low
out the match.
"Something wrong, boy?" 1 asked in a fatherly
tone.

''Yeah," he said with a heavy sigh, "my girl is
getting pinned "
"Gee but that's really tough. Really tough, kid,"
I said. (What else can you say?) This hit of news
floored inc. I thought she was mad for him. Every
time I saw the two together, she flashed that mother
cobra look in her eye.
"Can't you talk her out of it?" I said.
''Nope, she's made up her mind."
"Isn't there anything you can do?"
" 'Fraid not."
"Well you'll just have to kiss her of! and look for
greener pastures."
"You don't understand," he said with a thin,
pained look in his eye, "she getting pinned to me."

Whatever happened to the time? It seems as if
the quarter just begins and then it's finals time.
But I've got a meat idea. Why not have finals at the
beginning of the quarter instead of at the end?
In the second week of the quarter everyone is tan,
and smiling, and rested. Nobody's worried. That's
the time when people should have finals. As it. is
now, the student body is so exhausted from parties
and skiing and Friday afternoons that they naturally
crack under the pressure.

floored inc. I thought she was mad for him. Every
time I saw the two together, she flashed that mother
cobra look in her eye.
"Can't you talk her out of it?" I said.
''Nope, she's made up her mind."
"Isn't there anything you can do?"
" 'Fraid not."
"Well you'll just have to kiss her of! and look for
greener pastures."
"You don't understand," he said with a thin,
pained look in his eye, "she getting pinned to me."

Whatever happened to the time? It seems as if
the quarter just begins and then it's finals time.
But I've got a meat idea. Why not have finals at the
beginning of the quarter instead of at the end?
In the second week of the quarter everyone is tan,
and smiling, and rested. Nobody's worried. That's
the time when people should have finals. As it. is
now, the student body is so exhausted from parties
and skiing and Friday afternoons that they naturally
crack under the pressure.
People who visit Stanford in the early pari of the
quarter think that this is tlie best party school on
the coast. For right weeks it's I,eland Stanford
Junior Country Club. Then suddenly, a grim tense
ness settles on the campus. No dales for anyone.
The library is jammed, Rossotti's closes. The rcsl
home fills with hysterical patients. Indeed, Ihe smile
is gone from our campus.
And why? Why this unnecessary bloodshed? The
answer is that finals come at the worst time in the
whole ten week:;. It's eight, weeks of fun and two
week:, of hell no matter how you slice it. So why not
get the unpleasant stuff out of the way and get down
to the real purpose of college—fun.

This >> the last Bull Session of the quartet' f»n
»mc. All things being rqual—the plus and minus
|n infs I'll br bacli next quarter to lead you further
astray a long (br road of vice, corruption* academic
fully, and general hedonism.
He: I of luck on your finals. Have fun over spring
vacation. See you next quarter.

Well it's about that time, "Roundup Time nn the
Farm." About once every ten weeks we count up
the livestock and see how we've done T, for one, was
planning to bring in a fine fold of A's with a few
spotted B's to prove that I had some fun. But as 1
survey the herd as it stampedes toward me. all I can

spy are some ornery C's. (I'm
hoping that these poor old eyes
are just tired from the long ride
but there could be a stray D with
my brand on its flank. Hear flank,
that is.)
But it's been a good quarter
all in all. I met a lot, of nice Stan
ford girls. But I didn't marry any
of them. No siree. I'm not ready
to bring home the bacon yet.
(Get it?) If not, tead the line

over several times and ask yourself, ' From what ani
mal does bacon come?" If you still don't, ask your
mother. If she's a Stanford woman and rightly sen
sitive, duck.
(Truly sorry about the above paragraphs.
But it's late at night and I'm punchy. I'll
f.tarl again.)
Remember at the beginning of the quarter in my
list of resolutions when I said that I wasn't going to
listen to any more stories from the late-daters? That
resolution went the way of all resolutions—onto paper
and out of mind. But anyway, a rather amusing in
cident occurred in one of these pre-clawn bull session;;.
A two-thirty trooper dragged himself into my room
and plunked down heavily in the overstuffed chair.
"Got a smoke?" he wheezed
"Sure," I ;aid and gave him one. The kid looked
fired. His eyes glowed a uniform i»«»»k. his cheeks
blushed a delicate tuschia, he was smeared with
a razzberry colored substance from ear <<> ear. He
looked like a man who's battled his way lo first place
in a watermelon mating contest.
"Thanks," he said. But there was something wrong
with him. He w-isn't, his usual jollv self Wo snappy
sayings. No quick comeback. I uoticcd that his hands
trembled as he succeeded in his third attempt to 1 low
out the match.
"Something wrong, boy?" 1 asked in a fatherly
tone.

''Yeah," he said with a heavy sigh, "my girl is
getting pinned "
"Gee but that's really tough. Really tough, kid,"
I said. (What else can you say?) This hit of news
floored inc. I thought she was mad for him. Every
