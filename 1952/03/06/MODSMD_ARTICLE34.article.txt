# Atom-Smasher Is Scientific Victory

### JIM MADISON 
(Editor's note: This is the first of two articles on Stanford's klystron and
linear accelerator. Tomorrow's article will describe these (wo wonders of
moderji science.)

Mioowdvc L.ab? Linear accelerator?
Whal arc they? Where are they?
This could be Joe Stanford's reaction if the subject of Stanford's
gigantic atom-smashing instrument and lab were mentioned in
conversation.
The story behind the linear accelerator, llie most powerful nu-

clear physics research weapon ot its'
type, centers around three men.
Two were brothers, Russell and
Sigurd Varian; the third was a re
markable Stanford physics profes
sor, Dr. William Webster Hansen,
who had won his BS. at Stanford
in 1929 and Ph.D. in 1933.
In 19;i7 their occurred a signifi
cant exchange of letters between
the brothers. Ituss, a pilot with
Pan Am in Mexico, was concerned
about a method for finding and
guiding planes through cloud and
fog.
Sig, a physics research assistant
at Stanford, thought he had the
basis for Hie necessary powerful
radio beam in a gadget called a
"rhumbatron" that Dr. Hansen had
invented.
A j a result, the brothers gave up
their work, took Russ's $4,U00 .sav
ings, and came to Stanford, seeking
use ol the physics lab anil machine
shop to develop a device to produce
the radio beam.
Dr. David L. Webster, then hea'l
of the Physics Department, gave
them this privilege .'long with titles
of research assistant . without pay.
Si ; ; plunged into the machine
shop. Out of copper, brass, and
plastic he fashioned almost all of
the parts for the tube, since liiey
were not obtainable iti any, market.
Six months after the Variant
had arrived on campus, Sic fin
ished the first "Klystron" tube. It
worked!
Today the Klystron, which be
came the receiving heart of all
Allied microwave radar in World
War II awl found extensive use
in microwave communication in
chidiut; TV, has borne a grand
son, termed the "mostcst every
thing" ever developed in the way
of a vacuum tube.
This grandson provides the power
that has permitted reality to come
to Dr. Hansen's theory of a linear
accelerator.
On a grant by (lie Office of Naval
Research for $12,500, lie constructed
a pilot model early in 194 K. On the
basis of its success, the ONR grant
ed' a larger sum to build the full
scale billion-electron-volt accelera
tor.

$170,000 contract, to Barrett i l / Hilp

Mioowdvc L.ab? Linear accelerator?
Whal arc they? Where are they?
This could be Joe Stanford's reaction if the subject of Stanford's
gigantic atom-smashing instrument and lab were mentioned in
conversation.
The story behind the linear accelerator, llie most powerful nu-

clear physics research weapon ot its'
type, centers around three men.
Two were brothers, Russell and
Sigurd Varian; the third was a re
markable Stanford physics profes
sor, Dr. William Webster Hansen,
who had won his BS. at Stanford
in 1929 and Ph.D. in 1933.
In 19;i7 their occurred a signifi
cant exchange of letters between
the brothers. Ituss, a pilot with
Pan Am in Mexico, was concerned
about a method for finding and
guiding planes through cloud and
fog.
Sig, a physics research assistant
at Stanford, thought he had the
basis for Hie necessary powerful
radio beam in a gadget called a
"rhumbatron" that Dr. Hansen had
invented.
A j a result, the brothers gave up
their work, took Russ's $4,U00 .sav
ings, and came to Stanford, seeking
use ol the physics lab anil machine
shop to develop a device to produce
the radio beam.
Dr. David L. Webster, then hea'l
of the Physics Department, gave
them this privilege .'long with titles
of research assistant . without pay.
Si ; ; plunged into the machine
shop. Out of copper, brass, and
plastic he fashioned almost all of
the parts for the tube, since liiey
were not obtainable iti any, market.
Six months after the Variant
had arrived on campus, Sic fin
ished the first "Klystron" tube. It
worked!
Today the Klystron, which be
came the receiving heart of all
Allied microwave radar in World
War II awl found extensive use
in microwave communication in
chidiut; TV, has borne a grand
son, termed the "mostcst every
thing" ever developed in the way
of a vacuum tube.
This grandson provides the power
that has permitted reality to come
to Dr. Hansen's theory of a linear
accelerator.

conversation.
The story behind the linear accelerator, llie most powerful nu-

clear physics research weapon ot its'
type, centers around three men.
Two were brothers, Russell and
Sigurd Varian; the third was a re
markable Stanford physics profes
sor, Dr. William Webster Hansen,
who had won his BS. at Stanford
in 1929 and Ph.D. in 1933.
In 19;i7 their occurred a signifi
cant exchange of letters between
the brothers. Ituss, a pilot with
Pan Am in Mexico, was concerned
about a method for finding and
guiding planes through cloud and
fog.
Sig, a physics research assistant
at Stanford, thought he had the
basis for Hie necessary powerful
radio beam in a gadget called a
"rhumbatron" that Dr. Hansen had
invented.
A j a result, the brothers gave up
their work, took Russ's $4,U00 .sav
ings, and came to Stanford, seeking
use ol the physics lab anil machine
shop to develop a device to produce
the radio beam.
Dr. David L. Webster, then hea'l
of the Physics Department, gave
them this privilege .'long with titles
of research assistant . without pay.
Si ; ; plunged into the machine
shop. Out of copper, brass, and
plastic he fashioned almost all of
the parts for the tube, since liiey
were not obtainable iti any, market.
Six months after the Variant
had arrived on campus, Sic fin
ished the first "Klystron" tube. It
worked!
Today the Klystron, which be
came the receiving heart of all
Allied microwave radar in World
War II awl found extensive use
in microwave communication in
chidiut; TV, has borne a grand
son, termed the "mostcst every
thing" ever developed in the way
of a vacuum tube.
This grandson provides the power
that has permitted reality to come
to Dr. Hansen's theory of a linear
accelerator.

Research for $12,500, lie constructed
a pilot model early in 194 K. On the

(Editor's note: This is the first of two articles on Stanford's klystron and
linear accelerator. Tomorrow's article will describe these (wo wonders of
moderji science.)

Mioowdvc L.ab? Linear accelerator?
Whal arc they? Where are they?
This could be Joe Stanford's reaction if the subject of Stanford's
gigantic atom-smashing instrument and lab were mentioned in
conversation.
