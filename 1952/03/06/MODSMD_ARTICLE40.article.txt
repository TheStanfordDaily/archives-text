# THE 						DU PONT DIGEST
## Ch.E's at Du Pont 
### 
The last issue of the Digest described
the broad opportunities offered
chemical engineers in research and
development at Du Pont. Now let's
look at the opportunities in produc
tion supervision.
In this important phase of plant
operation, Ch. E.'s and others arc
responsible for investment in plant
facilities, supply of raw materials,
supervision of operation and main
tenance, cost and shipment of fin
ished products, as well as personnel
relations, training and safety.

Normally, chemical engineers en
ter production supervision by reason
of preference and special abilities.
Their first step depends on which of
I en operating departments they work
in. For example, in one department
they follow a training program as
student, operators. In another, train
ing in a plant laboratory familiarizes
the engineers with processes and
products.
After t he training period, the men
are given supervisory responsibili-

Work as production supervisors prepares
chemical engineers for jobs in management

ties, usually starting as foreman. At
this level they meet problems like
these:
1. Occasionally, in a still connected
to a sulfonator by a pipe line with a
single valve, the product d isappeared,
and residue increased. The supervi
sor's study of control data showed
that small amounts of gaseous sul
fur trioxide were venting into the
still causing decomposition of the
product. His recommended installa
tion of a positive pressure block in
thepipeli nee 1 i m i nated the d i fficu 1 ty.
2. A high temperature batch reaction
process was revised to increase pro
duction of a critical material. For
safety, adjacent reactors had to be
shut down as work on each unit pro
ceeded. The supervisorplanned main
tenance and batch schedules to min
imize costly down-timeand re-trained
personnel for the new process.
In solving such problems, super
visors have an opportunity to use all
their knowledge and ingenuity.
Equally important, they acquire the

[ TIIIKD OF A SERIES ]

background and varied experience
that prepare them for advancement
to responsible positions in manage
ment and administration.
NEXT MONTH—The fourth article in this
series will deal with process develop
ment — to many engineers the most in
teresting part of plant operation.

The last issue of the Digest described
the broad opportunities offered
chemical engineers in research and
development at Du Pont. Now let's
look at the opportunities in produc
tion supervision.
In this important phase of plant
operation, Ch. E.'s and others arc
responsible for investment in plant
facilities, supply of raw materials,
supervision of operation and main
tenance, cost and shipment of fin
ished products, as well as personnel
relations, training and safety.

Normally, chemical engineers en
ter production supervision by reason
of preference and special abilities.
Their first step depends on which of
I en operating departments they work
in. For example, in one department
they follow a training program as
student, operators. In another, train

the engineers with processes and
products.
After t he training period, the men

Work as production supervisors prepares
chemical engineers for jobs in management
