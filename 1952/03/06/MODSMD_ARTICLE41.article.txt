Whatever you say about the '51-52 Indian basketball team, you have
to coneede it one thing ... it was by far the best offensive team in Stan
ford history, and it was also by far the worst defensive team.
This year's Card quintet broke all Stanford scoring records, not by 5
or 10 points, mind you, but by 403 points. Jim Ramstead wound up as
the second-highest scorer in Farm cage annals, Jim Walsh third, and Ed
Tucker sixth (doing it in only two years.) To pose an understatement, it's
somewhat unusual when you have three of the six highest scorers in
Stanford's history all on one team. Add to the three Ron Tomsic, who
figures to crack all scoring records by the time he is a senior, and you have
somewhat of an offensive team.

But as the late Al Jolson used to
say, "Brother, you ain't seen
nothin' yet."
According to statistics released
before the Cal games, Stanford was
the second highest team in the na
lion in free throw percentages and
the third highest in field goal per
centages. Bob Burnett's cagers hit
an unbelievable 40.4 per cent of
their floor shots, only five-tenths
of a per cent from the leader.
On the free throw line, the Cards
hit G9 per cent, second only to Kan
sas's 71. In short, in these depart
ments Stanford outsnookered top
teams like Kentucky, Illinois, and
West Virginia.
Want more figures? Okay, Stan
ford rolled up 2,015 points. Compare
this with the top Luisetti team of
'36-37. It tallied 1,326.
One more set of figures to throw
at you. Going into the Cal game,
Eddie Tucker had the second highest
free throw percentage in the nation.

Eddie, who was sccond highest scorer in the conference last year, was the
top man this season. Jim Ramstead, who led the league in rebounds, was
the second man on the scoring totem pole. And Walsh and Tomsic were
among the top seven.
Quite an offensive team Stanford had this year.
Now let's look at the defensive figures. In this department, Stanford
also broke all records—in reverse. Stanford went into the defensive hall
of fame through the back door. Sneaking through the servants' entrance
so as to speak.
The most points that had ever been chalked up against an Indian team
was 1,662. This season, the opponents found the baskets for 1,929. Com- ,
pare this to the 914 digits that Hank Luisctti's team allowed.

# # #
There is one more thing that should be said about the '51-52 Stanford
basketball team before its record is left to yellow in the history pages.
And this is something that you don't find in the statistics or the record
books.
On and off court, the coaches and the team members have always rep
resented what is sportsmanlike and good. This is in direct contrast to some
players we could mention. We have walked into several opposing team
dressing rooms and watched players who looked like they were marijuana
addicts who were dragged off the streets and issued basketball uniforms.
An incident that we'll always remember occurred after the last Cal
game in the dressing room. The players, six of whom had seen their last
collegiate basketball game, were perspiration-drenched, panting, but un- j
deniably happy.
Bob Burnett made his quiet way around the room, shaking each
players' hand, saying a few parting words to each. When he got to Jim
Ramstead, he said. "Jim, you've had a great season. The best of luck to
you, kid. When I have my children, I'd like them to be something like
you."
it was a simple tribute, hut it was as sincere and fitting as a tribute
can be. And it kind of summed up our feeling about the Stanford basket
ball team. Guys like Ramstead, Tucker, Walsh, and Ivcrsen are more
than good athletes. They are top notch people.

ford history, and it was also by far the worst defensive team.
This year's Card quintet broke all Stanford scoring records, not by 5
or 10 points, mind you, but by 403 points. Jim Ramstead wound up as
the second-highest scorer in Farm cage annals, Jim Walsh third, and Ed
Tucker sixth (doing it in only two years.) To pose an understatement, it's
somewhat unusual when you have three of the six highest scorers in
Stanford's history all on one team. Add to the three Ron Tomsic, who
figures to crack all scoring records by the time he is a senior, and you have
somewhat of an offensive team.

But as the late Al Jolson used to
say, "Brother, you ain't seen
nothin' yet."
According to statistics released
before the Cal games, Stanford was
the second highest team in the na
lion in free throw percentages and
the third highest in field goal per
centages. Bob Burnett's cagers hit
an unbelievable 40.4 per cent of
their floor shots, only five-tenths
of a per cent from the leader.
On the free throw line, the Cards
hit G9 per cent, second only to Kan
sas's 71. In short, in these depart
ments Stanford outsnookered top
teams like Kentucky, Illinois, and
West Virginia.
Want more figures? Okay, Stan
ford rolled up 2,015 points. Compare
this with the top Luisetti team of
'36-37. It tallied 1,326.
One more set of figures to throw
at you. Going into the Cal game,
Eddie Tucker had the second highest
free throw percentage in the nation.

Eddie, who was sccond highest scorer in the conference last year, was the
top man this season. Jim Ramstead, who led the league in rebounds, was
the second man on the scoring totem pole. And Walsh and Tomsic were
among the top seven.
Quite an offensive team Stanford had this year.
Now let's look at the defensive figures. In this department, Stanford
also broke all records—in reverse. Stanford went into the defensive hall
of fame through the back door. Sneaking through the servants' entrance
so as to speak.
The most points that had ever been chalked up against an Indian team
was 1,662. This season, the opponents found the baskets for 1,929. Com- ,
pare this to the 914 digits that Hank Luisctti's team allowed.

# # #
There is one more thing that should be said about the '51-52 Stanford
basketball team before its record is left to yellow in the history pages.
And this is something that you don't find in the statistics or the record
books.
On and off court, the coaches and the team members have always rep
resented what is sportsmanlike and good. This is in direct contrast to some
players we could mention. We have walked into several opposing team
dressing rooms and watched players who looked like they were marijuana
addicts who were dragged off the streets and issued basketball uniforms.
An incident that we'll always remember occurred after the last Cal
game in the dressing room. The players, six of whom had seen their last
collegiate basketball game, were perspiration-drenched, panting, but un- j
deniably happy.
Bob Burnett made his quiet way around the room, shaking each
players' hand, saying a few parting words to each. When he got to Jim
Ramstead, he said. "Jim, you've had a great season. The best of luck to
you, kid. When I have my children, I'd like them to be something like
you."
it was a simple tribute, hut it was as sincere and fitting as a tribute
can be. And it kind of summed up our feeling about the Stanford basket
ball team. Guys like Ramstead, Tucker, Walsh, and Ivcrsen are more
than good athletes. They are top notch people.
