Paced by Hal Schererman who
meshed 20 points, the Chem Five
icorcd an easy 55 to 21 win over
Village 308 in the Pavilion last
niÂ«ht. Dick Walz was high man
for the losers with 10 points.
The Chem quintet possessed too
much speed for the Village squad,
which was forced to play with only
six men. They sprinted to a 7-0 in
the first five minutes before the
losers could tank their first basket.
Although the Villagers crept up to
within two points at the end of the
first quarter, the Chem Grad.s fin
ished strongly as they clicked for
18 points in a row and a 29-6 half
time bulge.
The Village five tried to come
back in the second canto and at one
time dropped in six points in a row
against the tiring victors.
But the Chem Grads caught their

second breath and went on to pull
up their final margin of victory.
With Bob Ryan dropping in 16
points, the Kappa Sig 111 quintet
beat Terman Hall 47 to 32 in a game
played at the Encina Gym.
