## President Defends Foreign Aid Plan 
### 
WASHINGTON. March 6 (UP)
President Truman told the na
tion tonight that the $7,900,000,-
000 foreign aid program he sub
mitted to Congress today "may
make the difference between
life and death" of the free world.
Ho pleaded for renewal of the
mutual .senility program in two
special messages delivered 10 hours
apart.
The first, handed to the House and
Senate, warned lawmakers who plan
to cut foreign aid that their action
would he "foolish and dangerous."
In his second message, the Chief
Executive appealed directly to the
people over all radio and television
networks to support his program for
"avoiding another world war."
Members of Congress clearly were
not convinced. Chairman James P.
Richards (D-S.C.) said administra
tion forces will do "pretty darn well"
to hold cuts to $1 billion. He em
phasized he was not saying the cuts
should not be larger.
Chairman Tom Connally, whose
reflate foreign relations committee
will open hearings on the request
next week, said he is confident the
total can be reduced but he did not
say how much.
"I challenge anyone to tell me
how this country is going to defend
itself if wc abandon our Allies and
hole up on this continent," Mr. Tru
man said, "it just plain can't be
done."
He said such a policy would mean
cutting civilian output, "to the hone,"
raising huge armed forces, stiffer
controls and increased spending.
"What is worse, we would still not
be secure," he said.
