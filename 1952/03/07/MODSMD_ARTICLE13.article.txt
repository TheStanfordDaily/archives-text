# Players Score 'Triumph' In ‘Desire Under the Elms'
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
"Desire Under the Elms," which
opened last evening in Memorial
Auditorium, spots Eugene O'Neill fit
a transitional and undeniably mag
nificent point in hi:; career. He had
by now (1924) abandoned the ex
cessive irony which characterizes
his sense of the tragic in the ear
lier plays. Me had not, on the other
hann, turned yet to the abstract and
non - realistic devices which so
heavily mark most of his later
works.
Despite a few technical difficul
ties and the rustling of an un
certain audience, two things were
made clear last night. First, the
play has lost inone of its beauty
over the years. And second, the
Stanford Players, directed by A.
Nicholas Vardac, l ave produced a
triumph.
"Desire" is tragedy at agonizing
and brutally graphic heights. It ex
plores the effects of physical love on
Ephraim Cabot, on bis son Eben,
and on Abbie, third wife to the one
and lover to the other. These are
people driven by the desire for
land.
They live and love ami die by the
grace of a God as hard and stein as
the rock - hound New England
farm over which they fight.
When the play ends, Ephraim
still lias his farm. But his young
wife has been arrested for the
murder of the child she lias had
by Eben, who, guided by a mys
t cal realization that be must
share her puilt, has disappeared.
Ephraim is left with his God —
his land, his rocks.
We have, obviously, a terrifying
catalogue of evil: miserliness, thiev
ery, jealousy, greed, adultery, in
fanticide. Yet the whole is not. ugly,
for it is the very purpose of tragedy
to create beauty out of ugliness.
And this is what O'Neill has done.
Man, by virtue of his intense suf
fering, by lovp, by his willingness to
face punishment, is ennobled, re
affirmed as a creature of worth and
dignity.
In a gallery of fine performances
by such as Willard Smith, Fred
Foreman, and others, three sfand
out. Ronald Hayes interprets Eben
with a feeling and sensitivity which
is nothing short of remarkable. Hit
ting his stride after the largely ex
pository first act, he goes on to play
his love scenes with a passion which
culminates eloquently as he learns
of his son's Heath, then returns to
the side of his lover.
As Ephraim, Hal Burdick Sr. is
excellent. Perhaps no greater
tribute can be paid to him than
to point out the undeviating at
tention he is able to maintain
throughout his long second-act
monologue.
Margaret McKerma, as Abbie, is
good, if she fails, occasionally,
to reach the heights which her role
offers her, she is nevertheless adept,
controlled, and brings sympathy to
her part.
Wendell Cole's set undoubtedly
surpasses anything he has previ
ously done and is beautifully com
plemented by Delford Brummer's
lighting.
There are, to be sure, moments
when the play is not given the op
portunity to soar to its intrinsic
heights. Passages are now and
tgain slid over, full effect is .some
times interrupted. But these are
ninor complaints. "Desire Under
the Elms" goes beyond any produc
tion offered within recent memory
by the Stanford Players.

share her puilt, has disappeared.
Ephraim is left with his God —
his land, his rocks.
We have, obviously, a terrifying
catalogue of evil: miserliness, thiev
ery, jealousy, greed, adultery, in
fanticide. Yet the whole is not. ugly,
for it is the very purpose of tragedy
to create beauty out of ugliness.
And this is what O'Neill has done.
Man, by virtue of his intense suf
fering, by lovp, by his willingness to
face punishment, is ennobled, re
affirmed as a creature of worth and
dignity.
In a gallery of fine performances
by such as Willard Smith, Fred
Foreman, and others, three sfand
out. Ronald Hayes interprets Eben
with a feeling and sensitivity which
is nothing short of remarkable. Hit
ting his stride after the largely ex
pository first act, he goes on to play
his love scenes with a passion which
culminates eloquently as he learns
of his son's Heath, then returns to
the side of his lover.
As Ephraim, Hal Burdick Sr. is
excellent. Perhaps no greater
tribute can be paid to him than
to point out the undeviating at
tention he is able to maintain
throughout his long second-act
monologue.
Margaret McKerma, as Abbie, is
good, if she fails, occasionally,
to reach the heights which her role
offers her, she is nevertheless adept,
controlled, and brings sympathy to
her part.
Wendell Cole's set undoubtedly
surpasses anything he has previ
ously done and is beautifully com
plemented by Delford Brummer's
lighting.
There are, to be sure, moments
when the play is not given the op
portunity to soar to its intrinsic
heights. Passages are now and
tgain slid over, full effect is .some
times interrupted. But these are
ninor complaints. "Desire Under
the Elms" goes beyond any produc
tion offered within recent memory
by the Stanford Players.
"Desire Under the Elms," which
opened last evening in Memorial
Auditorium, spots Eugene O'Neill fit
a transitional and undeniably mag
nificent point in hi:; career. He had
by now (1924) abandoned the ex
cessive irony which characterizes
his sense of the tragic in the ear
lier plays. Me had not, on the other
hann, turned yet to the abstract and
non - realistic devices which so
heavily mark most of his later
works.
Despite a few technical difficul
ties and the rustling of an un
certain audience, two things were
made clear last night. First, the
play has lost inone of its beauty
over the years. And second, the
Stanford Players, directed by A.
Nicholas Vardac, l ave produced a
triumph.
"Desire" is tragedy at agonizing
and brutally graphic heights. It ex
plores the effects of physical love on
Ephraim Cabot, on bis son Eben,
and on Abbie, third wife to the one
and lover to the other. These are
people driven by the desire for
land.
They live and love ami die by the
grace of a God as hard and stein as
the rock - hound New England
farm over which they fight.
When the play ends, Ephraim
still lias his farm. But his young
wife has been arrested for the
murder of the child she lias had
by Eben, who, guided by a mys
t cal realization that be must
share her puilt, has disappeared.
