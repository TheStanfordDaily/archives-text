# Excom's Political Plan—A Start
## 
### 
n*eoiri Wednesday niqht went on record as
favoring one ot live alternate plans for settinq
up a program to provide an impetus to political
education on campus. Iti, choice o( a non par
; tisaa ciuh headed by a student faculty execu
tive committee wo legard as a stait —a conser
vative start, but none thelesa a beginning.
Excom made it:? choice upon recommenda
tion from its political education committee,
which also presented these alternative pro
posals for consideration:
1 A student I acuity board by itself to ar
, range piogiams ot political speakers.
2. A political club headed by an all student
hoaid (mstead of the recommended student
I acuity board).
< .? A union ol partisan political groups.
4. Partisan groups with no controJ.
All but the first ot these are broader in scope
than early plane. Excom's political education
committee, after a series ol open hearings anil
'after a good deal ol study began thinking in
. lerms of greater student participation than
periodic speaker programs would allow This
W&c a good logical extension.
While we oit inclined to lavor a union of par
tisan political groups over the Lxconr recom
mended plan, we consider all but the first and
last alternatives acceptable.
A union of political groups with some control,
Fpme sort of governing body to define an op
erating framework might be a better solution
. than that favored by Excom.
Our only quarrel with Excom's recommenda
tion is that non-partisan gioups tend to lack the
vigor and the push that partisan fervor can and
does generate. This spirit, if kept within logi
< al bounds, we feel, could result in the healthy,
rational, educational approach we are seeking,
and have the partisan interest to keep the pro
gram alive and vital.
The first alternative, a student-faculty com
nnttee to airange political speakers, does not
allow lor the degree ol active student par
ticipation the oilier plans would involve. It
would bo a matter ol arianging programs per
il-" two or three times a quarter, and watch
ing student interest lag in the inteiim.
The last proposal, uncontrolled parly groups,
v/e consider undesirable now.
Wg would oppose plan as being out cf
line with the whole attempt ol the committee lo
provide an educational rather than propaganda
Wc feel unhampered political action
t would lend very stronoiy toward the torch
r* light demonstration type of affair. II not this, we
would obje> i to the slogan and campaign but
ton, thi 3 "I Like Ike," the "No Third Term," ap
v. proa» h, which while not irrational, we feel isn't
the logical, argumentative program we should
be seeking.
This approach is realistic, sure. It is politics.
But it should be supplemented by reason, which
vie fpel would occur in a union scheme better

than in unbridled partisan competition. Essen
tially, the plan recommended by Excom, de
tailed by-laws of which are yet to be formulated
and approved, would operate something like
this:
The student faculty executive board would
be the policy making and governing organ.
Membership on the boaid would lie chosen
with a view toward political balance, so that
members with any one party affiliation would
not dominate.
Below this level, the non partisan club would
be open to any student It would operate on a
subcommittee basis. At present, three such
committees are envisaged: a ser vice committee
to provide information on absentee ballots, reg
istration, etc., a speaker procurement' commit
tee, and several study groups based on current
political issues.
Would the plan be so 'politically sterile as
to be unworkable? We would say this: ti has
a reasonable chance ol succeeding. Willi
proper leadership and good, active member
ship it can. While it would be nominally nun
partisan, paitisan tendencies would be in
evitable, and this type ol meinbeisliip could
provide the impetus lot u successful program.
Without these leadership and membership
ingredients, however, the program could sput
ter and stall belore it really starts.
While we can foresee binds and difficulties
in the recommended plan, we see them also in
the othei proposals. Projecting a scheme into
the future to test its workability is a risky busi
ness. Ceneial practicality must be considered.
But at the same time, you can't look at structure
and ding a plan before il begins to operate.
We'd be more than willing to give the
scheme a chance lo work. What il will require
is approval ol the Board of Trustees, and the
Board, il it goes along, would have lo reverse a
policy document that dates back to 1911, which
prohibits partisan political activity on campus.
The beauty ot Excom's se/ ol alternatives
is that one could logically evolve into the
next step il there is the ne&tl lor such evolu
tion.
But we are goinq to have lo demonstrate to
the Board that we can crawl before we begin to
walk.
Right now, there is little doubt there is a
tremendous political apathy ou the Stanford
campus. Take any othei university with a com
parable intelligence level, a comparable basic
course of studies and you'll probably find a
great deal more political consciousness.
Stanford traditionally has failed to provide
the stimulus for a high degree of political con
sciousness among students.
The plan under consideration now awaits
the final approval of Excom arid approval ol
the Board ol Trustees.
II it is disapproved it will be a serious fail
ure lo meet a great student need.

n*eoiri Wednesday niqht went on record as
favoring one ot live alternate plans for settinq
up a program to provide an impetus to political
education on campus. Iti, choice o( a non par
; tisaa ciuh headed by a student faculty execu
tive committee wo legard as a stait —a conser
vative start, but none thelesa a beginning.
Excom made it:? choice upon recommenda
tion from its political education committee,
which also presented these alternative pro
posals for consideration:
1 A student I acuity board by itself to ar
, range piogiams ot political speakers.
2. A political club headed by an all student
hoaid (mstead of the recommended student
I acuity board).
< .? A union ol partisan political groups.
4. Partisan groups with no controJ.
All but the first ot these are broader in scope
than early plane. Excom's political education
committee, after a series ol open hearings anil
'after a good deal ol study began thinking in
. lerms of greater student participation than
periodic speaker programs would allow This
W&c a good logical extension.
While we oit inclined to lavor a union of par
tisan political groups over the Lxconr recom
mended plan, we consider all but the first and
last alternatives acceptable.
A union of political groups with some control,
Fpme sort of governing body to define an op
erating framework might be a better solution
. than that favored by Excom.
Our only quarrel with Excom's recommenda
tion is that non-partisan gioups tend to lack the
vigor and the push that partisan fervor can and
does generate. This spirit, if kept within logi
< al bounds, we feel, could result in the healthy,
rational, educational approach we are seeking,
and have the partisan interest to keep the pro
gram alive and vital.
The first alternative, a student-faculty com
nnttee to airange political speakers, does not
allow lor the degree ol active student par
ticipation the oilier plans would involve. It
would bo a matter ol arianging programs per
il-" two or three times a quarter, and watch
ing student interest lag in the inteiim.
The last proposal, uncontrolled parly groups,
v/e consider undesirable now.
Wg would oppose plan as being out cf
line with the whole attempt ol the committee lo
provide an educational rather than propaganda
Wc feel unhampered political action
t would lend very stronoiy toward the torch
r* light demonstration type of affair. II not this, we
would obje> i to the slogan and campaign but
ton, thi 3 "I Like Ike," the "No Third Term," ap
v. proa» h, which while not irrational, we feel isn't
the logical, argumentative program we should
be seeking.
This approach is realistic, sure. It is politics.
But it should be supplemented by reason, which
vie fpel would occur in a union scheme better

than in unbridled partisan competition. Essen
tially, the plan recommended by Excom, de
tailed by-laws of which are yet to be formulated
and approved, would operate something like
this:
The student faculty executive board would
be the policy making and governing organ.
Membership on the boaid would lie chosen
with a view toward political balance, so that
members with any one party affiliation would
not dominate.
Below this level, the non partisan club would
be open to any student It would operate on a
subcommittee basis. At present, three such
committees are envisaged: a ser vice committee
to provide information on absentee ballots, reg
istration, etc., a speaker procurement' commit
tee, and several study groups based on current
political issues.
Would the plan be so 'politically sterile as
to be unworkable? We would say this: ti has
a reasonable chance ol succeeding. Willi
proper leadership and good, active member
ship it can. While it would be nominally nun
partisan, paitisan tendencies would be in
evitable, and this type ol meinbeisliip could
provide the impetus lot u successful program.
Without these leadership and membership
ingredients, however, the program could sput
ter and stall belore it really starts.
While we can foresee binds and difficulties

be the policy making and governing organ.
Membership on the boaid would lie chosen
with a view toward political balance, so that
members with any one party affiliation would
not dominate.
Below this level, the non partisan club would
be open to any student It would operate on a
subcommittee basis. At present, three such
committees are envisaged: a ser vice committee
to provide information on absentee ballots, reg
istration, etc., a speaker procurement' commit
tee, and several study groups based on current
political issues.
Would the plan be so 'politically sterile as
to be unworkable? We would say this: ti has
a reasonable chance ol succeeding. Willi
proper leadership and good, active member
ship it can. While it would be nominally nun
partisan, paitisan tendencies would be in
evitable, and this type ol meinbeisliip could
provide the impetus lot u successful program.
Without these leadership and membership
ingredients, however, the program could sput
ter and stall belore it really starts.
While we can foresee binds and difficulties
in the recommended plan, we see them also in
the othei proposals. Projecting a scheme into
the future to test its workability is a risky busi
ness. Ceneial practicality must be considered.
But at the same time, you can't look at structure
and ding a plan before il begins to operate.
We'd be more than willing to give the
scheme a chance lo work. What il will require
is approval ol the Board of Trustees, and the
Board, il it goes along, would have lo reverse a
policy document that dates back to 1911, which
prohibits partisan political activity on campus.
The beauty ot Excom's se/ ol alternatives
is that one could logically evolve into the
next step il there is the ne&tl lor such evolu

But we are goinq to have lo demonstrate to
the Board that we can crawl before we begin to
walk.
Right now, there is little doubt there is a
tremendous political apathy ou the Stanford
campus. Take any othei university with a com
parable intelligence level, a comparable basic
course of studies and you'll probably find a
great deal more political consciousness.
Stanford traditionally has failed to provide
the stimulus for a high degree of political con
sciousness among students.
The plan under consideration now awaits
the final approval of Excom arid approval ol
the Board ol Trustees.

n*eoiri Wednesday niqht went on record as
favoring one ot live alternate plans for settinq
up a program to provide an impetus to political
education on campus. Iti, choice o( a non par
; tisaa ciuh headed by a student faculty execu
tive committee wo legard as a stait —a conser
vative start, but none thelesa a beginning.
Excom made it:? choice upon recommenda
tion from its political education committee,
which also presented these alternative pro
posals for consideration:
1 A student I acuity board by itself to ar
, range piogiams ot political speakers.
2. A political club headed by an all student
hoaid (mstead of the recommended student
I acuity board).
< .? A union ol partisan political groups.
4. Partisan groups with no controJ.
All but the first ot these are broader in scope
than early plane. Excom's political education
committee, after a series ol open hearings anil
'after a good deal ol study began thinking in
. lerms of greater student participation than
periodic speaker programs would allow This
W&c a good logical extension.
While we oit inclined to lavor a union of par
tisan political groups over the Lxconr recom
mended plan, we consider all but the first and
last alternatives acceptable.
A union of political groups with some control,
Fpme sort of governing body to define an op
erating framework might be a better solution
. than that favored by Excom.
Our only quarrel with Excom's recommenda
tion is that non-partisan gioups tend to lack the
vigor and the push that partisan fervor can and
does generate. This spirit, if kept within logi
< al bounds, we feel, could result in the healthy,
rational, educational approach we are seeking,
and have the partisan interest to keep the pro
gram alive and vital.
The first alternative, a student-faculty com
nnttee to airange political speakers, does not
allow lor the degree ol active student par
ticipation the oilier plans would involve. It
would bo a matter ol arianging programs per
il-" two or three times a quarter, and watch
ing student interest lag in the inteiim.
The last proposal, uncontrolled parly groups,
v/e consider undesirable now.
Wg would oppose plan as being out cf
line with the whole attempt ol the committee lo
provide an educational rather than propaganda
Wc feel unhampered political action
t would lend very stronoiy toward the torch
r* light demonstration type of affair. II not this, we
would obje> i to the slogan and campaign but
ton, thi 3 "I Like Ike," the "No Third Term," ap
v. proa» h, which while not irrational, we feel isn't
the logical, argumentative program we should
be seeking.
This approach is realistic, sure. It is politics.
But it should be supplemented by reason, which
vie fpel would occur in a union scheme better

than in unbridled partisan competition. Essen
tially, the plan recommended by Excom, de
tailed by-laws of which are yet to be formulated
and approved, would operate something like
