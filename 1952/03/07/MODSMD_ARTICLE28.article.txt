* it happens every quarter ot this time, a strange
metamorphosis will change Stanford students foi the
next two weeks A sort of Jekyll and Hyde proposi
tion.
No longer will Stanford roughs amble down the
quad with a spring in their steps, a whistle on their
lips, and no book.-, in their hands. Because, accord
ing t > the time schedule, next week i. dead week,
after that, finals week. When clonic cfHWes

**"*' "Wi'dfi i'jht tomorrow, a strange
transition will take place. Stu
dents who before were pointed
out as normal, red- blooded Ame
rican", will now just be pointed
out.
Brows will wrinkle; full, fleshy
lips will become livid and quiver
'ing; tans will disappear, and pale,
'.ghustly skins will replace them;
bodies-will bend under the strain;
will become bloodshot; and

faces will become gaunt and drawn.
■ In a word, ehums, finals are drawing near.
During the two weeks that follow, all Stanford
students will fall under one of the following classi
fications:
First, we have the classification under which most
of the students fall. This is the type of guy (who wo
will call "A' ) who kisses off studies during the first
eight weeks of i< hool, thinking he can lit all Ins
- studying into dead and finals weeks. When this time
comes around, "sleep" is a duty word. "A" walks
mound campus, rattling a box of no-doze and every
hour adjusting th* scotch tape on his eyes r.o hi ;
eyelids won't shut. He refuses to eat or sleep . . .
,/.'i,tucly and more study" is his motto
During these two weeks he is su ascetic (hat lie
""Inakes a Franciscan monk look like a playboy in com
parison.
Then we have "B." Me is the opposite of "A."
No matter l ow little studying he lias done during
the quai lor, his motto is "Be fresh f<ir the tesl.
v Cramming is a waste of time . . . just a lot of
sleep." Consequently, he yets 14 hours ol beauty
vest every night with a three hour nap in llie after
noon. When the day of the final eomes, he smilingly
walks into the classroom with a brisk stride and
does a little diadow boxing a la Joe Louis, just to
show everyone he's fresh and ready for the test,
"li" sits down at the desk, reads over the questions,
discover he doesn't know the first thing about them,
and foils over in a dead faint,
N'.-.t, we have the cast of the prad ctudent. lie

doesn't have onv finals . . . just a large-sized thesis
to finish. A week ago he disappeared in (he stacks,
and no one has :;een him since. Finally, ho finds his
way to the main floor, and runs through the main
libe a raving maniac. He waves his arms wildly,
froths at the mouth, and in between chews on the
Encyclopedia Britannica, lie keeps muttering, "I am
an alka-selzer pill . . . fizzle, lizzie . . . sshhhh . . .
lizzie, fizzle . . . sshhhh."
'1 hen we have the guy who is philosophical about
finals. Win, lose, or draw, he always has some stock
witticism for the situation. He may have just flunked
a test, but he'll say sorni thing like, "Well, ha, ha, win
a lew lo' e a few," or "Have to take the bitter with
the sweet' or "'lough one to lose" or "Mere today,
gone tomorrow '
Also, we have the case of the student who slept
through his eight o'clock final. It's the test for the
most important course in his major field, and lie isn't
allowed to make it up. He decides lo end il all.
They'll hud him late in spring qua iter when the
water in Lake Lag recedes.
1 hen there's the last, quarter senior who wants to
gain rrvenge on all the mousey librarians who kept
.shushing him during his four years at Stanford. He
gathers all the librarians, tiptoes to the center of the
libe with them, stops and slater, right in their toiler
tiv« faces. Then lu screams at the lop of his lungs
and whips out, leaving the Img-eyed librarians frozen
iu their tracks.
Also, there's the student who keeps up with his
studies during the quartet, and he doesn't h.ive to
cram during finals. This type of student isn't very
common, however. Three years ago, one was found
and lie was put on exhibition by the psych depart
mcnt.
Finally, you have the full professors who have no
work to do during finals week They've already made
out the tests (which includes a 1)0 point essuy ques
tion on sub-footnote "B"), and they have readers to
take care of correcting the papers.
They want to impress upon the students that they
can leave foi their vacation a week early, so two of
them walk through the main libe at the end of dead
week. One is attired in a colorful swim suit and has
a beach towel and the other is wearing Ins natty golf
brogans As they pass by the studying students, they
are suie to say in extra loud voices things like, "Buy,
it sure will feel good to g< t to Santa Cruz tomorrow"
or "It will be nice to be on the golf course instead
of in a stuffy classroom."
