### RUBY BERNSTEIN 
If Mrs. J. E. Wallace Sterling kept a guest book, she would have
over 15,000 signatures. For every year at least 5,000 students, fac
ulty, trustees, and friends of Stanford flock to the house on Mirada
Street for teas, dinners, and informal talks.
The attractive Mrs. Sterling is a busy woman. Not only must she

find time to look after her husband
and take care of her three children,
but she must l>e responsive to her
constituents, the 7,500 students at
Stanford, the large faculty, the trus
tees, and the 50,000 alumni of the
University.
"II people know each other, they
will like each other," Mis. Sterling
smiles as she tells of her many
friendly chats with Stanfordites. Al
most. every Stanford student visits
the Sterling home at least once in
his college career.
(iala Student Teas
In the fall the president's wife has
an - opportunity to meet entering
freshmen and# transfer students
whom she welcomes to the Stanford
family at a reception. In the spring,
a highlight of graduation activities
is Ihe tea the president and his wife
give for seniors and their parents.
The Sterlings have an opportunity to
gel better acquainted with campus
leaders when Excom comes for din
ner.
Mrs Sterling, as her calendar
shows, enjoys meeting people. In
her pari. a:, a community leader she
finds time to schedule meetings with
the Faculty Women's club, the board
of directors of the Palo Alto Red
Cross, the senior auxiliary to the
convalescent home. Jn addition she
keeps up on civic a flairs with the
Century Club in San Francisco and
is a member of the Current Events
Club. Mrs. Sterling meets with the
campus Y and Cap and Clown or
ganizations of which she is an hon
orary member.
Job as JJoinemakor
"There is no more difficult job
than being a homcmakcr," Mrs.
Sterling says. She has three children:
Bill, 12, a student at Jordan Junior
High school; Susan, 10, and Judy, 7,
who attends the Stanford elementary
school. In her spare time the ener
getic campus leader works in her
garden.

Hit home is the former residence
of ex-President and Mrs. Herbert
Hoover, and is dedicated to the late
Mrs. Hoover.
Antiques and Art
The home is noted for its high
ceiling interior, its spacious gardens,
11 fireplaces, and 1!5 bathrooms. II
] is furnished tastefully and has many
art pieces and much antique furni
ture which are all parts of Mrs.
Sterling's collections. Some of these
have been sent to her by apprecia
tive foreign students who attended
Stanford.
She believes that the young women
who attend Stanford are more realis
tic than were the girls with whom
she went lo school. Stanford women
know that a career, while important,
should he subordinate to the role of
learning to be a good wife and a
community leader.
Mrs. Sterling is in her "Junior"
year at Stanford. She arrived here
in I'MO when Dr. Sterling was named
| to the | out as president.
h'ecmitly the women of Village 121
j and 123 dedicated their residences to
Mrs. Sterling, an honor which ranks
I her with the foremost women lead
j ers at Stanford, past and present.
