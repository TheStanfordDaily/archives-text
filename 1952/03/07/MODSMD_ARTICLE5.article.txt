# A 						Click of the Switch Sends Electrons Speeding Accelerator Flashes Power

Switch on! Switch o(f!
For a millionth of a second
enough power to licjht a city of
35,000 people flashes through
ihe gigantic Linear Accelerator.
For a sixtieth of a second the
power is turned off before the
cycle is repeated.
What occurs during this minute
fraction of a second?
Conjure a mental picture of a
silver - lined automobile muffler
220 feet long, divided into sections
every two feet much like the
chambers of a bamboo stalk. Into
each of these sections insert 23
gold-edged disks, equally spaced
like the muffler baffle plates.
Each of these disks has a %-inch
diameter hole drilled through its
center. Before installation, the cen
ters of the disks are aligned 011 a
mandrel.
Tne 220-foot succession of closely
spaced holes then forms what seems
i like a narrow, foot - long tube to
| the barrage of elctions traveling at
99.99999 pei cent of the speed of
light, 188,300 miles a second.
Every ten feet alonft the ae
! ceierator there is a giant Klys
j tron tube, which produces and
steps up the ultra-high-frequen
| cy radio wave on which the elec
trons ride.
At the beginning of the cylinder
is a magnetron, a large cathode
tube, which shoots out the electrons
;at a high initial rate of speed. At
| the end of the cylinder is located a
target into which the high-speed
electrons crash. And running the
entire length, shielding it complete
ly, is a concrete wall which pro
tects the physicists from radiation.
That is how a simplified version
of the accelerator looks; how does
it work?
Once again, switch on!
Out from the electron gun. the
magnetron, shoots a stream of

electrons at extremely high fre
quency. The disks are so aligned
that some of the electrons are ac
celerated more than the others.
The:-e faster electrons caUh up
with the slower ones much like
fast autos overtaking slower ones
on a four-lane highway.
The process forms bunches of
electrons alternating with brief in
tervals of virtually no electron in
habitation .
The frequency of these bunched
spots coincides with the frequency
of the high-energy radio beam pro
duced in the spaced Klystron tubes.
It's as if each bunch of electrons
were a surfboard riding down the
crests of successive waves of seas—
the radio beam.
As the procession shoots down the
accelerator, the electrons, having
attained a high initial velocity,
closely approximating the speed of
light, gain mass in accordance with
Einstein's Equation of Relativity
(E Mc') with kick in energy from
the Klystron tubes.
When they reach the end of the
cylinder, the electrons have about
2.000 times then original mass.
The whole theory of atom
smashing is based on studying (he
particles that break off a smashed
atom. So the physicists nut this
extremely htyyh mass electron to
work by crashing it into an atom
target and watching the paths and
actions of the pieces that flv off.
It's been asked why scientists are
so enthusiastic about the linear ac
celerator and its billion electron
volts of power, when in just a
couple of years Cal's supercyclotron
will put out four to five billion
volts.
The answer lies in the funda
mental operating differences be
tween the two. The cyclotron ac
celerates the heavier neutron par
ticles in a gradually enlarging cir
cle, while the accelerator acceler
ates the lighter electrons in a
straight line. Comparing them is
like comparing apples and oranges.


THE BEGINNING—The late Dr. William Hansen examines the
first three-foot section of Stanford's one billion electron volt
Linear Accelerator which he designed.
