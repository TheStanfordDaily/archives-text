# Braves List Two Games
## 
### 
Hoping to boost their one-game
winning strak, the Braves will face
two foes this weekend. Today at
3:15 p.m. they meet the strong Se
quoia High nine in a replay of an
earlier rain-out. Tomorrow morn
ing at 10, CCSF journeys down to
the Farm.
Coach Dick Clegg is still looking
for some more batting power and
will continue to shift his lineups
around. Probably pitching for the
Braves will be Gil Duncan, Dave
Freeman, Frank Smith, and Ron
Boyer.
