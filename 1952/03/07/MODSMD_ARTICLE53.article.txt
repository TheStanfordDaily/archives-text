Witli complete disregard for fixes, de-emphasis, talk of dirty play, and
other athletic misdemeanors the sport world continues to blissfully re
volve. Stanford is no exception to the rule.
Basketball is safely tucked away for another year and Spring sports,
the most neglected of all endeavors, are beginning their annual appear
ance on the Farm sporting scene. Before locking up basketball for good
this year, there are a few points we would like to make.
Coach Bob Burnett deserves much cerdit for his excellent job in his
first year as Stanford's head basketball coach. The team's record of 19
wins and only 9 losses—the best an Indian team has done since 1943—
speaks well for the young mentor. Outside of the six conference losses,
Stanford only dropped one collegiate contest; that to Oklahoma. The In
dian's other two losses were administered by the Phillips' CGers and the
Stewart Chevrolets.
This year's racehorse, shoot 'em quick, Stanford team set a new Stanford
record of 2,015 points in 28 games or about 72 digits per contest. However,
and this pains us, the Indians also had more points scored against them
over a season than any other Card squad.
On the brighter side is the naming of Jim Ramstead as outstanding
Northern California player of the year by the local writers and broad
casters. There is a rumor in the wind that Rammer might get an invite
to play for the West in the East-West all-star cage game for seniors held
in Kansas City.
One more word on basketball. We believe that Burnett's two platoon
system of ball, will catch on. It did wonders for Stanford. Also more boys
get to play under this system. If such does happen, don't be too surprised
to see in the future offensive and defensive all so-and-so teams named
instead of just all around top player selections.
And now on to Spring sports. Baseball is booming and to date the
Indians have looked sharp. With pitchers such as Rog Osenbaugh, Bob
Murphy, Joe Chez and Phil Page, we look for the locals to be tough pickings
for anybody. Track starts shortly ancl again the Indians will be tough.
In swimming Stanford is tops and is expected by all to finish in the first
four in the Nationals. The tennis squad is promising.
Crew, the most deserving, but yet only non recognized Stanford sport is
starting to shape up. Nothing strenuous this quarter. The boys are only
at Palo Alto Yacht Harbor at 5:45 a.m., a true boon, in comparison with
spring quarter when call to duty sounds an hour earlier.
Bob White, head coach, has been having his troubles with the new
coaches launch the past mornings. On Monday, the first day of the 5:45
routine, everything was set to go. The shells were milling about waiting
for White in his launch. The launch came, but went right by the shells
and beached itself on a near-by mud flat. The reason: the steering cable
had broken. On Tuesday with steering cable having been carefully re
paired, all was again set. This time the launch just wouldn t start. In
vestigation revealed a dead battery. To our knowledge all is now running
smoothly.
Turning to that noble sport fencing, we note that the Stanford swords
men travel to San Francisco Saturday to compete in the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiae Foils championships. The boys will be up against competi
tion from S.F. State, California, UCLA, Arizona, and Washington State.
It is no small occasion.
And the colossus of them all will he soon with us again. Spring fool
hall practice begins in early April and Chuck Taylor and staff will be on
hand to welcome all interested. l)on Sanders who played an awful lot
of defensive back for the Indians last fall is so far behind in his work,
that he may be lost to the squad come fall.
And so the sports world goes round and round.
The thought ran through our head the other evening that perhaps the
Stanford band at basketball games and occasions other than football games,
should do something to distinguish itself. Something like donning Indian
head dresses. Wo suggest this because we have heard in the past months
how "neat" the California straw hat band has looked, especially on Tele
vision, and how they stood out, mostly because of their straw hats.
We don't recommend any such plan however, primarily because we are
against the principle of borrowing anything from California and secondly
we seem to recall an awful fuss kicked up when we attempted to imitate
that good California Oski and found ourselves stuck with something called
"Little Ugh."
Witli complete disregard for fixes, de-emphasis, talk of dirty play, and

four in the Nationals. The tennis squad is promising.
Crew, the most deserving, but yet only non recognized Stanford sport is
starting to shape up. Nothing strenuous this quarter. The boys are only
at Palo Alto Yacht Harbor at 5:45 a.m., a true boon, in comparison with
spring quarter when call to duty sounds an hour earlier.
Bob White, head coach, has been having his troubles with the new
coaches launch the past mornings. On Monday, the first day of the 5:45
routine, everything was set to go. The shells were milling about waiting
for White in his launch. The launch came, but went right by the shells
and beached itself on a near-by mud flat. The reason: the steering cable
had broken. On Tuesday with steering cable having been carefully re
paired, all was again set. This time the launch just wouldn t start. In
vestigation revealed a dead battery. To our knowledge all is now running
smoothly.
Turning to that noble sport fencing, we note that the Stanford swords
men travel to San Francisco Saturday to compete in the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiae Foils championships. The boys will be up against competi
tion from S.F. State, California, UCLA, Arizona, and Washington State.
It is no small occasion.
And the colossus of them all will he soon with us again. Spring fool
hall practice begins in early April and Chuck Taylor and staff will be on
hand to welcome all interested. l)on Sanders who played an awful lot
of defensive back for the Indians last fall is so far behind in his work,
that he may be lost to the squad come fall.
And so the sports world goes round and round.
The thought ran through our head the other evening that perhaps the
Stanford band at basketball games and occasions other than football games,
should do something to distinguish itself. Something like donning Indian
head dresses. Wo suggest this because we have heard in the past months
how "neat" the California straw hat band has looked, especially on Tele
vision, and how they stood out, mostly because of their straw hats.
We don't recommend any such plan however, primarily because we are
against the principle of borrowing anything from California and secondly
we seem to recall an awful fuss kicked up when we attempted to imitate
that good California Oski and found ourselves stuck with something called
"Little Ugh."
Witli complete disregard for fixes, de-emphasis, talk of dirty play, and
other athletic misdemeanors the sport world continues to blissfully re
volve. Stanford is no exception to the rule.
Basketball is safely tucked away for another year and Spring sports,
the most neglected of all endeavors, are beginning their annual appear
ance on the Farm sporting scene. Before locking up basketball for good
this year, there are a few points we would like to make.
Coach Bob Burnett deserves much cerdit for his excellent job in his
first year as Stanford's head basketball coach. The team's record of 19
wins and only 9 losses—the best an Indian team has done since 1943—
speaks well for the young mentor. Outside of the six conference losses,
Stanford only dropped one collegiate contest; that to Oklahoma. The In
dian's other two losses were administered by the Phillips' CGers and the
Stewart Chevrolets.
This year's racehorse, shoot 'em quick, Stanford team set a new Stanford
record of 2,015 points in 28 games or about 72 digits per contest. However,
and this pains us, the Indians also had more points scored against them
over a season than any other Card squad.
On the brighter side is the naming of Jim Ramstead as outstanding
Northern California player of the year by the local writers and broad
casters. There is a rumor in the wind that Rammer might get an invite
to play for the West in the East-West all-star cage game for seniors held
in Kansas City.
One more word on basketball. We believe that Burnett's two platoon
system of ball, will catch on. It did wonders for Stanford. Also more boys
get to play under this system. If such does happen, don't be too surprised
to see in the future offensive and defensive all so-and-so teams named
instead of just all around top player selections.
And now on to Spring sports. Baseball is booming and to date the
Indians have looked sharp. With pitchers such as Rog Osenbaugh, Bob
Murphy, Joe Chez and Phil Page, we look for the locals to be tough pickings
for anybody. Track starts shortly ancl again the Indians will be tough.

that good California Oski and found ourselves stuck with something called
"Little Ugh."
Witli complete disregard for fixes, de-emphasis, talk of dirty play, and
other athletic misdemeanors the sport world continues to blissfully re
volve. Stanford is no exception to the rule.
Basketball is safely tucked away for another year and Spring sports,
the most neglected of all endeavors, are beginning their annual appear
ance on the Farm sporting scene. Before locking up basketball for good
this year, there are a few points we would like to make.
Coach Bob Burnett deserves much cerdit for his excellent job in his
first year as Stanford's head basketball coach. The team's record of 19
wins and only 9 losses—the best an Indian team has done since 1943—
speaks well for the young mentor. Outside of the six conference losses,
Stanford only dropped one collegiate contest; that to Oklahoma. The In
dian's other two losses were administered by the Phillips' CGers and the
Stewart Chevrolets.
This year's racehorse, shoot 'em quick, Stanford team set a new Stanford
record of 2,015 points in 28 games or about 72 digits per contest. However,
and this pains us, the Indians also had more points scored against them
over a season than any other Card squad.
On the brighter side is the naming of Jim Ramstead as outstanding
Northern California player of the year by the local writers and broad
casters. There is a rumor in the wind that Rammer might get an invite
to play for the West in the East-West all-star cage game for seniors held
in Kansas City.
One more word on basketball. We believe that Burnett's two platoon
system of ball, will catch on. It did wonders for Stanford. Also more boys
get to play under this system. If such does happen, don't be too surprised
to see in the future offensive and defensive all so-and-so teams named
instead of just all around top player selections.
And now on to Spring sports. Baseball is booming and to date the
Indians have looked sharp. With pitchers such as Rog Osenbaugh, Bob
Murphy, Joe Chez and Phil Page, we look for the locals to be tough pickings
for anybody. Track starts shortly ancl again the Indians will be tough.
In swimming Stanford is tops and is expected by all to finish in the first
four in the Nationals. The tennis squad is promising.
Crew, the most deserving, but yet only non recognized Stanford sport is
starting to shape up. Nothing strenuous this quarter. The boys are only
at Palo Alto Yacht Harbor at 5:45 a.m., a true boon, in comparison with
spring quarter when call to duty sounds an hour earlier.
Bob White, head coach, has been having his troubles with the new
coaches launch the past mornings. On Monday, the first day of the 5:45
routine, everything was set to go. The shells were milling about waiting
for White in his launch. The launch came, but went right by the shells
and beached itself on a near-by mud flat. The reason: the steering cable
had broken. On Tuesday with steering cable having been carefully re
paired, all was again set. This time the launch just wouldn t start. In
vestigation revealed a dead battery. To our knowledge all is now running
smoothly.
Turning to that noble sport fencing, we note that the Stanford swords
men travel to San Francisco Saturday to compete in the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiae Foils championships. The boys will be up against competi
tion from S.F. State, California, UCLA, Arizona, and Washington State.
It is no small occasion.
And the colossus of them all will he soon with us again. Spring fool
hall practice begins in early April and Chuck Taylor and staff will be on
hand to welcome all interested. l)on Sanders who played an awful lot
of defensive back for the Indians last fall is so far behind in his work,
that he may be lost to the squad come fall.
And so the sports world goes round and round.
The thought ran through our head the other evening that perhaps the
Stanford band at basketball games and occasions other than football games,
should do something to distinguish itself. Something like donning Indian
head dresses. Wo suggest this because we have heard in the past months
how "neat" the California straw hat band has looked, especially on Tele
vision, and how they stood out, mostly because of their straw hats.
We don't recommend any such plan however, primarily because we are
against the principle of borrowing anything from California and secondly
we seem to recall an awful fuss kicked up when we attempted to imitate
that good California Oski and found ourselves stuck with something called
"Little Ugh."
