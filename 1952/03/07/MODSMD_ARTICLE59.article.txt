### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Stanford's rugby team won their
biggest game of the season yester
day when they handed the Thun
derbirds from Briti h Columbia a
3-0 defeat, the third for the Cana
dians in 17 games.
The game was played in the Sta
dium in a sea of mud. The rain
never let up during the game, a fac
tor that undoubtedly helped the
heavier Cards. The fleet little ÜBC
backs never could manage to shake
loo: e lor any substantial gain.- , and
ball-handling was extremely diffi
cult.
No Scoring in F!' si Naif
'I lie first half saw no scoring at
all, as most of the play was con
centrated around midfield.* The
ÜBC forwards, outweighed 15

pounds a man by the Cards, put up
an amazing showing as they got
possession oi tne bait on 12 out oi
the 22 scrums and four out of tiii
ten lineouts.
In tne second half, however, r
teady stream of ÜBC injuries com
bined with the great efforts of the
Card scrum men swayed the bal
ance in Stanford's favor. With three
minui.es gone Hon Cook got oil a
pop kick that carried to the ÜBC
10 - yard line. The Thunderbird.
were guilty of an infraction and
Flutcli Metten booted a penalty
i;ick through the uprights givinj.-
the Cards a 3-0 lead and ending
scoring for the day.
Second Half Shortened
The second half was shortened to
'20 minutes and with three minutes
left to play, wings George Puil and
Gerry Main put on a drive that
carried to within the Stanford five
yard line. The final whistle found
ed with the ball inches from Card
pay-dirt.
Saturday at 2:.10 Stanford will be
matched with California in a game
that will probably decide the Pa
cific; Coat championship. The Bears
are favored to win the PCC crown

this year, and in Max Howell and
Les Richter have two of the best
rugby players now in the game.
Kichter anil Howell Star
Richter, a 230 - pounder in his
fourth year of rugby for the Bears,
has been detciibed as tne greatest
rugby player in Cal history. The
two - year football All - Anerican
plays lock and does the kicking.
Howell, the former Australian
Wallaby star who was in trumenta 1
in the 50-10 shellacking the Wal
labies handed Stanford in 1048,
holds the Bear backfield together
and provides them with scoring
punch.
The game will be held in the
