# Youth Camps for Peace
## German Trio Fosters Plan 
### BARBARA TUERK 
In 1043 three German univer
sily students had on idea. That
idea has now blossomed into an
international youth movement of
:toacl ily growing influence. The
'dory of this movement lias been
brought to Stanford by 24-year
old Karl Roeloffs, ASSU Ex
change Scholar from Germany.
In the summer of the three
established a work (an p 111 H. nover
for 100 German boys and "iris ei'
hi"h school a r {e. Last s imnier there
were 100 such camp.*-. alt'-n led hj
',000 campers, including 500 non
rJorrnans, and ECO Cc rn ans were
working in camps in foreign coun
tries, This summer tlic camps plan
stiil further expansion.
Karl laughed h.t, during his
IVtil.v inlervicsv, 1 m was â–  erion.s
when li" describe:! the <" mp's prr
piise in promoting intei natbm d
friendships among students still
young enough to lie deeply im
pressed liy sue;! cam") experiences.
Karl, a history major who plan?
to return to Germany rcxt year to
teach, has worked training college i
.Indents as leaders of the: e camps.
Kxpliiiniii'' (lie beginnings of (lie
International Youth Service, as the
organization is called, Karl ad
mitted that even the group's found
ers were pessimistic about its
chances for success. Such camps
had l:cen in operation before both
world wars, yet, he said, "just a
few .years later old friends were out
shooting at each other again. Ger
mans still believed thai all Knglish
were cruel, and all i ietich stupid."
The new camps, he explained, dif

for from older groups of similar pur
pose in several important ways.
Among the most significant ones he
enumerated were:
1) The formation of political dis
cussion i',roups to meet during the
winter. In these meetings, students
relate their vague emotions <>f in
ternational friendship with concrete
ideas about polities. These groups
have focurcd their attention on
European unification.
2) The optimism generated l:y

i (he constructive activities of (lie
| camps. When they were lii>( ex
panding there was a debate as to
| whether students should J,c as
' i'fned (o clearing ruhhlc. The
leaders decided instead to concen
trate <sn re-fore >l''*tion and rermi
strii'tion 011 the principle that "it's
more encouraging to huild than to
tear down."
D) Their inclusion of young work
1 ers as well as students in the pro
! gram. Karl is particularly optimistic
about the success of the program
j when he discusses its bridge of class
i lines.
4) The opportunity for German
! student: to spend a summer working
j in foreign countries alter a year or
| two of camp experience in their own
country. In one case an entire high
! school class was transported to Eng
land. "You should have seen how
1 people from that particular school
1 rushed to volunteer the next sum
| mer," Karl commented, in an accent
| less "foreign" to California cars than
of any New Yorker.
The success of the org/mr/ation can
| probably best be demonstrated, how
eveu, by the high percentage of
campers who volunteer to return the
next summer. Fifty to sixty per cent
: of the campers have come back for
i a second summer, and many arc par
ticipating for the third or fouith
time.
