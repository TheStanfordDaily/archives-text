companies a price increase il they
will grant the union the 2G-ccnt
package proposed by the wage
board. But later, he said, the Presi

upon."
Wilson also said he still considers
the wage board proposal a serious

Truman Explains
The President accepted the resig
nation in a letter praising Wilson's
past service but strongly defending
what the mobilization czar said is
the administration plan to seek a
steel settlement on the basis of
wage boosts without compensating
price hikes.
Mr. Truman said it was true he
had agreed to a "possible necessity"
of allowing the steel companies
some added price hikes, but added
that the wage board's 26-cent for
mula does not amount to "any real
breach in our wage stabilization
poliices."
Under the circumstances, Tru
man added, he had no choice but
to accept Wilson's reisgnation, ef
fective at once.
The White House announced that

ment before April 8, the date the
union has set as a deadline for a
strike by 600,000 workers.

departure from government service
would cause great confusion in the
wage talks. But it. was impossible
to tell immedaitely what it would
do to the union's threat to call a
strike if the industry does not grant
the 26-ccnt "package."

wage talks. But it. was impossible
to tell immedaitely what it would
do to the union's threat to call a
strike if the industry does not grant
the 26-ccnt "package."
WASHINGTON, March 30
(UP) —Defense Mobilizer Charles
E. Wilson quit today with an
angry charge that President Tru
man gave him a go-ahead to plan
steel price increases and then
went back on his word.
Wilson, who has served in key
defense production jobs in two na
tional emergencies, said in his letter
of resignation, dated last Friday,
that the government's plan for set
tling the steel dispute "violates my
sense of justice . .
He .'-aid Mr. Truman tint gave
him a go-ahead to promise the steel
companies a price increase il they
will grant the union the 2G-ccnt
package proposed by the wage
board. But later, he said, the Presi
dent "changed the plan we agreed
upon."
Wilson also said he still considers
the wage board proposal a serious
threat to the controls program.
Truman Explains
The President accepted the resig
nation in a letter praising Wilson's
past service but strongly defending
what the mobilization czar said is
the administration plan to seek a
steel settlement on the basis of
wage boosts without compensating
price hikes.
Mr. Truman said it was true he
had agreed to a "possible necessity"
of allowing the steel companies
some added price hikes, but added
that the wage board's 26-cent for
mula does not amount to "any real
breach in our wage stabilization
poliices."
Under the circumstances, Tru
man added, he had no choice but
to accept Wilson's reisgnation, ef
fective at once.
The White House announced that
Presidential Assistant John R.
Steelman would take over Wilson's
duties temporarily pending selec
tion of a new chief mobilizer, be
ginning tomorrow.
Steel Talks Continur
Steel industry and union leaders
prepared tonight to open last-ditch
wage negotiations tomorrow in an
atmosphere made more tense by
Wilson's sudden resignation.
Representatives of the CIO United
Steel Workers and the six largest
steel companies met in New York
to try to negotiate a wage settle
ment before April 8, the date the
union has set as a deadline for a
strike by 600,000 workers.
It appeared certain Wilson's hasty
departure from government service
would cause great confusion in the
wage talks. But it. was impossible
to tell immedaitely what it would
do to the union's threat to call a
strike if the industry does not grant
