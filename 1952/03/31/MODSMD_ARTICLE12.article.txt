# H.S.T. Throws Democratic Race Wide Open
## Democratic, Republican Consensus —'Good Move'; Europeans Wonder 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 3D (UP)— Democratic hopefuls scram
bled wildly for a seat on the Democratic presidential bandwagon
today but a member of his official family said President Truman
will throw his powerful support behind Illinois Gov. Adlai E.
Stevenson.
Mr. Truman himself had no word on his choice for a successor,

hut he solemnly promised a Cather
ine «112 2,000 cheering Democrats that
he will wage h typical Truman "give
'em hell" campaign this fall for the
parly's choice.
The President .-aid he will be ' in
there pitching, ju:l as if 1 were the
nominee" and just as if he had not
electrified a .Jefferson-Jackson Day
dinner Saturday night hy announcing
that "I shall not he a candidate for
reelection."
Many Republicans contended
the political picture had not
changed s<» far as their party is
concerned because any Democratic
nominee will have to run on the
Truman Administration's record.
Sen. Robert A. Taft thought the
Democrats would have to "draft"
Mr. Truman because eny other
candidate would be weaker.
' ■ov. Stevenson stood firm on pre
vious statements that he is a can
didate for Governor of Illinois and
nothing, else. But this did not neces
sarily mean he would not accept a
"draft" or even word from the Presi
dent that he was the party's best
man and must run.
Meanwhile southern Democrats
made no effort to hide their joy at
the President's decision. Almpst to
a man they said it would go a long
way toward healing the wounds
caused by the fight between them
and the President over civil rights.
In Europe, officials paid tribute
i't President Truman and his for
eign policy, and some expressed
fcai 4 that his decision to bow out
might leave the way open for a
it turn of American isolationism.
Most officials restricted their
comments to warm praise for the
President's aid-to-Europe policies
and expressed the hope that such
policies would not be abandoned by
Mr. Truman's successor.
Numerous spokesmen believed
Mr. Truman's action in stepping
down would aid the candidacy of
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, who
they believed would carry on a
similar foreign policy.
Reports ;. e that Eisenhower
may speed up his return home to
consolidate bis Republican Presi
dential campaign set-up now that
President Truman is out of the
running.
Ffe'.pon i bio sources said the
Washington news might hasten Ei
senhower's request for relief from
his European command, and ad~
vancc the time when the general
would disclo e his intentions.
For the time being, President
Truman's future plans are secret,
but White House sources said to
day lie expects to remain very
much in the public eye after he
leaves office in January. Among
other things he'd like to become
a lecturer and an honorary Senator.
The proposal which intimates say
appeals to Mr. Truman the most is
one to let ex-Presidents become
I ex - officio members of the Senate.
I Friends in Congress are expected
I to push the proposal now that the
I President has declared himself.
