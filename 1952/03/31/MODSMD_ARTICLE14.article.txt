# Clash Foreseen In Nebraska
## 
### 
OMAHA, "darch 30 (UP) â€”Okla-
homa Sen. Robert S. Kerr emerged
as a full-fledged Presidential candi
date today, locked in a crucial bal
lot battle tomorrow with Sen. Estes
; Kefauver in a Nebraska Democratic
primary election that took on new
significance after the bombshell of
President Truman's withdrawal.
While both candidates expressed
no surprise over the eleventh-hour
development, it. threw both camps
into furious activity with the nomi
nation now more than a vague po
litical hope.
The Kerr-Kefauver test is esti
mated to bring 100.000 Democrats
t<> the polls, and overshadow the
Republican "write-in" campaigns
of backers of Gen. Dwight D. Ei
senhower and Sen. Robert Taft
(R , O.).
Former Minnesota Gov. Harold
Stasscu, on the ballot but battling
the mushrooming write-in moves,
will fly here tonight for a last
minute appeal for support in a
state whe/e he has won the last
two GOP "popularity contests."
In Wisconsin, Sen Robert A. Taft,
reacting to President Truman's de
cision to retire, today put in a plug
for Sen. Estes Kefauver as the Dem
ocratic choice in the Wisconsin
Presidential primary Tuesday.
Taft predicted he will win the
Wisconsin GOP race but declined to
estimate the number of delegates ho
will win or the vote he will poll.
