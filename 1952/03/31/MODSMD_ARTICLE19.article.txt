# Spring Fever
## 
### 
Spring quarter. Beach parties and warm
evenings, Lake Lag and picnics, and sunshine,
sunshine, For the lreshmen, its their first spring
quarter, and a tup. But a pleasant trap. For
ihe seniors, its their last time around. Nine
weeks and then lor the men out into the arms
of the didll or some sort of military service.
It's ti tough time to be getting out of college.
But probably no worse than much of the rest j
of the last two decades. The early thirties, to j
a lossfj extent the late thirties, and the forties:
v/ere times "out of joint"â€” by now we're getting
used to jt and accepting it as the usual.
Ifiqht now, ihe sun's too biiqht, the qrazs
too green, the lake too mvitinq to woriy too j
much about if.
