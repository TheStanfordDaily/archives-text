# BULL SESSION
## Spring Quarter 
### DICK McLEAN 
Here's the quarter you've been wailing for. This
i; the famous fight weeks you've heard so much
:ihout.. Yet, it's Spring Quarter. Welcome home.
H<nv w;i Balboa? Did the parties on Coral Avenue
live up to f.uuil? ilow was Sun Valley? Break any
I'llow was Dos Angeles and and
Riverside and Pasadena and Portland and Seattle
and Phoenix and San Francisco and Milpitas? Food
was good (home cooking) but I'll bet you got a bit
hired. AI way. happen:;. Rut anyway, welcome back.
Vcu'ie iust in ume lor the real vacation.
All old Stanford veterans, sophomore, ami
i® ?*• know that Spring Quarter i:. actually a fraud.
Pajpy dutifully wiiti's out a $220 i-herV to the Uni
versity, pats you on the head, and says, "Keep up
,ir good work son." You give the kindly old
duiToj n manly swat on the back and say, "Kicjhn,
!'cippor," and abscond with the doni-h (The Uni
\er ity pockets the lo««t with h wink and the curi
r pir \cy begins). In case yon haven't gotten the
word, college is the only pntext in the |»tingtirne.
Nobody who's "in tin* know" studies spring quai'ler.
Us not done.

If ycu lor,l ~t your catalogue of
cour- rs. « on II see some interest
ire' addition- to tin ciurieidiun.
r l 1 i University is offering some
auties this quarter. For in -
itanr, Introductory Massage (PK
109) Contract Bridge an<l Three
Card IVlontie (Physics 11); The
Fhyuology of Sleep (strictly a
kb course); Weight Lifting for
1 ib- Rossctti's 21 (an upper
di i. ion course;, and L'Omellette

100 (from 5 to on Wednesday and by direction).
Xlif ie and man', othei firie com - s are dieted only

in the springtime. All for the phenomenally low j
tost of $220. Just think, barely over one-fourth of i
a thousand dollars. It's a steal. Carrying a maxi
mum of 13 units that comes to a measely $10. 89 a
unit.
You say you're woriied about grades? Don't. This
bloody weapon called a curve is a two edged sword.
In the eager autumn and drab winter quarters the
moles and DAR's (damned average raisers) have
their day and make us normal people scramble like
the devil for the bottom rung which is labeled C-.
But in the Spring—that golden time o» the year the
curved sword, like the pendulum of time, swings
back again. Those Phi Deters with that "keyed up"
look about them poop out in the borne stretch. (No
stamina). And the field is left to us, the happy hedon
ists ;tiid libeial libertines. It's play time, beach time,
loaf time, sun time, anytime. Good old Spring Quar
ter.
II you feel that you must study, take your hook
out into tin- sunlight. Put on a pair of dark glasses
and iust try to re digest the dust of the pages. Just
try in fudy. It's a funny thing hut there's magic
in sun—-the hut, lazy sunlight of the Spring. First,
ii attacks the body and saps from it the grim
physical vigor that forrts a •person to do tin* neces
sary things.
Next, it attacks the mind melting the soft gray
( lay called the brain. The thinking processes ooze i
off and soon the only room is for gentle reverie and
phantasy, kiually the sunlight invades the sold.
There the contest ends. In the happy warmth of
spring quarter you're like the waffle batter to the
waffle iron, 'i he mold Is s6t so there's no use fight
ing. Why not give up?
The lake i full, the sky is cloudless, the beaches
ore begging l<u people the i.ebox out at Rosso I's is
crammed to overflowing, the volley ball courts are
dry. the world is in turmoil, the generation is lost,
the A-bomb is coming .oon—so hurry.
