## Taft's Political Hopes May Get Kiss of Death in Slam Bang Vote 
### HADLEY ROFF 
The political hopes of Senator Robert A. Taft, perennial presi
dential aspirant since 1040, may receive the kiss of death tonight
when the ballots are counted in Wisconsin's slam-banrj primary
election.
Those close to Taft, including his campaign manager Thomas E.

Coleman, say he will bow from
presidential race if swamped in the
Badger State voting.
In Wiscotr in, Taft is locking
horns with Governor l\a> I Warren J
of California and Harold Stassen,
both of whom are counting heavily
on snaring the votes of Eisenhower |
supporters.
Though Eisenhower is not on the
ballot in Wisconsin, both Warren
and Stassen arc claiming they will
throw votes to the smiling general
from Kansas if they are unable to
capture the nomination.
If he wins Wisconsin's favor,
Stas en has pledged to surrender
half his delegation to Eisenhower at
the COP convention in July.
Not to be outdone, Warren
hackers ran an advertisement in
the Appleton (Wis.) Post-Cres
cent, March 22. with a headline
flaring "Remember, a vote for
Warren is a vote for Warren and
Eisenhower."
Taft fears the Eisenhower vote, j
That was made clear two weeks ago i
when Taft tried to withdraw from ;
the New Jersey primary when he j
realized the other candidate in that
race, Governor Alfred E. Driscoll, I
v/as pledged to Eisenhower.
However, Taft's political po
tency can't be discounted. Both
Warren and Stassen recognize
that Taft's vote - getting machine
is almost mechanically perfect.
He has big names on his list of
delegates, including the wife of
the shite Governor Walter J.
Kohler. Taft has also received
generous campaign donations
from many of the state's indus
trialists.
The delegations of Warren and
Stassen have not the prestige
names,' claim those familiar with
Wisconsin politics. Warren's dele
gation includes several delegates of
decided liberal leanings, on" of
whom is Philip F. La Follette, lung
time political progressive.
The heaviest verbal punches in
the campaign were scored over
foreign policy diflerences as War
ren and Taft stood on opposite
sides of the political fence and
Stassen straddled the top post.
In angry debate Warren and
Taft have argued the handling of
affairs in Asia. Taft insists that
the United States assume a "ijct
tough" policy, while the Califor
nia Governor claims that relations
with Red China must be handled
"with kid gloves."
On domestic issues, Warren, bid
ding for Wisconsin's traditional lib
eral vote, asks that the federal gov
ernment "be evolutionary."
"We must plant our feet in the
direction of progress," he said.
Taft, grumbling over what he
calls "America's progress down the
road to Socialism," has blasted
"the me - too principle in govern
ment" and calls for Americans to
again adopt the individual enter
prise system.
The only stand stressed by
Stassen in his bid is that if elected
he will reinstate General Douglas
Mac Arthur to his Far East com
mand.
Democratic strength in Wisconsin
has always been feeble. Only ma
jor candidate running there is Ke
fauver, who is hands-down favorite
to win the Democratic nod. The
other two candidates, Jerome F.
Fox and Charles E. Broughton, had
both pledged to Truman, but I heir
platform was ripped asunder Sat
urday when Truman flatly refused
to seek re-nomination.
