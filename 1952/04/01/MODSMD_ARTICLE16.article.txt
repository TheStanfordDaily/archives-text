## Partisans May Speak on Farm 
### 
otanford moved today towards a relaxation of its long-standing
ban against permitting partisan political figures to speak on the
campus.
Under a ruling adopted by the Board of Trustees, persons who

tics may be invited to speak at meet-*
ings at Stanford under an adminis- !
trative procedure still to be estab
lished.

lowed requests from the University's
Committee on Public Exercises and
the Associated Students, stipulated
that speakers of a partisan nature
shall be approved by the Committee
on Public Exercises.

cussed is controversial, a sufficient
number of meetings shall he ar
ranged in order to insure presen
tation tif all aspects of th? con
troversial subject, and that the
various speakers be of high com
petence."
In an election year and if cam
paign issues are to be discussed, the
meetings are to be restricted to stu
dents, faculty, and staff of the uni
versity, and different points of view
will be presented at the same meet
ing by speakers "of high compe
tence."

he reported to ASSU Executive
Committee tomorrow night, calls
attention to the fact that the pro
gram is designed to he educational

tion" mu«t be given to the Found
ing Grant in carrying out the pro
gram.
Commenting on the action, Student
Body President Wayne Alley said,
| "This is a profound change in edu
cation at Stanford, the success of
which will be measured by the
thought it stimulates."
Specifically, the trustees referred
to the following paragraph of the
Founding Grant: . . . "Its (Stan
ford's) purposes (are) to promote
the public welfare by exercising
an influence in behalf of humanity
and civilization, teaching the bles
sings of liberty regulated by law,
and inculating love and reverence
for the great principles of govern
ment as derived from the inalien
able rights of man to life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness."
