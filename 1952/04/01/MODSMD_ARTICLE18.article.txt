## 
### RUBY BERNSTEIN 
"There's probably nothing
about Stanford that she doesn't
know." This is the general opin
ion of the friends and fellow
workers of Miss Lillian Owen,
executive secretary in the presi
dsnt's office, who today is ob
serving her 30th anniversary of
working with Stanford.
Miss Owen came to the presi
dent's office in 1943. During the war
she and Professor Harold Bacon
of the Mathematics Department
worked under Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur in handling the budget for the
Army Specialized Training Program
Then when Dr. TresirHer became
president, she was moved to the po
sition of executive secretary.
The executive secretary's work is
three-fold. She checks th* budget?
that are 'submitted by department
and school heads. Under Dr. Ster
ling's approval, she writes the
leaves of absences and appoint
ments that are made to faculty and
members.
A third and major part of her
work is school policy. Faculty and
school officials respect her knowl
edge of the workings of the Uni
versity and she is frequently con
sulted on "can we do this . . ."
Before coming to the president's
office, Miss Owen worked in the
1 Employment Office, which was then
j called the Appointment Office. *
When, in the early '20's, the
Graduate School of Business
opened, she became executive
secretary and instructor in busi-

ness reports. Miss Owen re
mained with the Business School
for 18 years where she was "very
well liked," according to her
brother-in-lpw Jack Shoup, alum
ni director.
A member of a family of five
Stanford graduates, she is the sister
of Mrs. Jack Shoup, wife of the
alumni director. Last year she waj
chairman of the luncheon at the
alumni conference.
