# Public Relations Committee on Trial
## 
### 
The time has come fci Public Relations Com
rr.iiire to prove its right to exist,
( Jo./; little moi«r than a yesr after ihe com
mittee's formation, its purpose- is being ques
tioned and the efficiency of its operation is
. 7 criticised Unless the committee can cor
ieci .;;; current inadequacies, it may well be
rorns a valid target for execution in a program
fcr simplifying student government.
The sad aspect at ihe situation is that Public.
Relations Committee has 3 leal job to do, This
was brought sharply into locus at the March b
riludent Workshop Student organization prob
l<?.ns boiled down to one main challenge: com
munication—how to let tire student body know
//hat ihe organizations are doing.
In one v/ 01 kship discussion group, a Drives
Con unit tee mem.be/ toid how much Drives
Com had appreciated having someone to go
to tor advice on publicizing last quarter's
Fcreign Relief Drive. Without fuLlic Ftela
licl. Committee, no campus organization ex
ists which j.j equipped to give this advice.
The Daily, foi example, is always glad to
discuss newspaper publicity but it has neither
the iimc nor the qualifications to plan a cam
r-j'jn involving radio programs, posters, and
living group contacts.
f/Uch possible Pub Rel Corn tasks as com
-1 iiing a list ot campus organizations and mak
u \ .'ilk screen equipment available to poster
jruikers were also suggested at the- Workshop.
One ot the principal reasons why Public Re
ialicns Committee is not accomplishing more is
an acute lack of personnel The chairman, Har
vey Segall and a few assistants aie working
long ajid hard, but more than a one man com
mitfee is required.
Wo believe that the committee's current
member-procurement policy is one reason fcr
its lack of success. Thus far it haj attempted io
ijct juniors and seniors with experience in other
campus organizations. We would recommend

instead that it train a large staff of freshmen and
sophomores interested primarily in publicity.
These workers could begin by doing office
work and by the time they were upper class
men would have learned the basic techniques
tor publicizing campus events. The emphasis
should be swit- hed from campusology to com
munication.
The committee could also help its current
standing by making an official report to Ex
com This report has been requested but its
actual presentation delayed lor several
months The chairman explains thai much
the committee has done is intangible and de
ties repotting However, much that it has
done is tangible (aid to the Foreign Relief
Drive, foi example) and the less concrete ac
complishments can also be referred to.
If Public Relations Committee is to continue
as a part ot Stanford hie, it should be prepared
to give an accounting ol itself It should be pre
pared io convince Excom — and ihe student
body— that it has a real purpose and is making
a real etfort io fulfill this purpose efticientiy
