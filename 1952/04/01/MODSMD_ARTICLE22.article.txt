### PETE GROTHE 
Sun Valley Serenade
While the greater percentage of ihe Farm popu
lation was lying around on beaches getting a coi
loetivr tan, «bout a hundred Stanfordites were ex
ercising while getting a tan- at Sun Valley.
Arid 1 should like to announce that skiing at Sun
Wiley i'. different from skiing at any other plac?.
When you tali at Yosetnite, Squaw Valley, 01 Dodge
Ridge, you fall, and that's it. But when vou fall at

Sun Valley, you slide down the
lope 50 feet after you fall. One
■ i icr fell at the top ol Exhibition
Kim (the steepest one) and didn't
•fop sliding until he had readied
rhe bottom 300 yards later
His posterior had made its way
through the ski pants
1 dor. t know if the slopes are
steep oi not, but as one Stanford
i.,e put it, "It's the first time I
*vrr had to stick my (bin in my

< hi • t to see the bottom ' . My Swiss instructor,
Tony, says, "Iff you fall, y.iss iss all right, bccaut/P
vee all learn by lalling ' And it this is so. 1 am onp
of th»j most learned people at Sun Valley ......
Run Valley i. somewhat over-rated, adept at part
in.? a dollar from its owner, but unnhstakeably great,
'."ji-splie it- weaknesses, it has unlimited facilities, and
most. important, it has an uncommonly good ski area.
A nelwoik of seven ehairlifts pipe a steady line of
skier:; to the slopes, and the run from the top of
Haldy Mountain to the bottom is well over two
miles... ~
Vou can go to Sun Valley on the very reasonable
SIS a vvfvi? special, and this includes everything—
h fl)n, board e.haiiiilt,, and lesson'. Vou run also
t c • a room hi I he plush Sun Valley i,odge foi
a clay (the tops), and the. includes nothing except
«n nnformi mattress, a retinue ut scivants, and a

handsome bill.
Tliree Stanford schusserjj, Alex Kosloff,
Dave Taylor, and Dave Fish took Kosloffs single
engined plane to Sun Valley, but for ail the good it
did them, thty might as well have taken a slow boat
to China.
First, they found themselves about 100 miles south
of their planned route and had to land on a highway,
thereby Mocking traffic from both directions. liater
they took off, and landed on another highway near
Elko, Nevada. 'Ihe trio tried to hitchhike to Elko
and after several hours of waiting in vain for a car
to pass they discoveied they were on a closed road.
The trip was calculated to take five hours. It took
70
Among the guests at Sun Valley were movie
people Nmma Shearer and Dan Dailey. Dailey put
on a great show lor some of the guests Thursday
night, and he explained that Hollywood is going
to make a ski movie at Sun Vulley next year with
he, Dailey, the stai Dailey. whose dancing is far
better than his skiing, said that a t»5 piece or
chcstra would be brought up with each musician
playing under a mogul, A "mogul" being a large
si/ed bump or mound placed at intervals that are
calculated in spill a slier with the greatest effi
ciency
Sun Valley doesn't miss an opportunity to charge
its guests. It's widely advertised that a skier in en
titled to a beautiful gold award if he can ski all the
way liorn thn top o! Baldy to the bottom without a
• pill. Hy some tluke 1 was able to negotiate the moun
tain without a fall, and 1 went to the desk to claim
my ski medal Whereupon 1 was informed that it
would cost $2,
And 1 submit that it is not the most rewarding
feelinp. in the- world alter having belabored over two
miles of steep and bumpy slopes without a tali to
be told that you are eligible to pay $2.
