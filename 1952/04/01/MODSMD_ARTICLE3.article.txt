### 
OMAHA, Neb., March :$l (UP) —
Estes Kefauver and Robert S. Ken
put their Presidential hopes on the
line tonight in a fighting finale to
the Nebraska preference primary
election campaign.
Forecasts of fair, warm weather
tomorrow heralded a heavy turn
i out of voters, perhaps nearly 300,-
000. Both the newly significant
Democratic primary and efforts of
Sen. Robert A. Taft and Gen.
Dwight D. Eisenhower backers to
I continue the "write-in" trends at
tracted wide interest.
Polls open at 8 a.m. and close at
j 8 p.m. and a long complicated bal
| lot indicated a .slow count both in
: city and rural precincts. Nearly 100
j candidates for delegates to national
conventions sought 18 GOP scats
! and 12 Democratic. They will not
1 be bound by primary results.
Kerr and his Tennessee opponent
both expressed confidence that they
would win. Oklahoma Senator Kerr
| claimed that, win or lose, he still
has substantial support in other
states and that lie will wind up with
three-fourths of Nebraska's dele
gates anyway.
Neither the Eisenhower nor Taft
camps claimed victory, pointing to
the uncertainty of their furious last
minute write-in campaigns. Fol-
I lowers of Harold Stassen said they
hoped Nebraskans remembered
"which candidate had enough inter
est in Nebraska to get on the bal
lot months ago."
Kerr said he was "now an all
out candidate for President." He
! said President Truman's withdrawal
I should help him.
