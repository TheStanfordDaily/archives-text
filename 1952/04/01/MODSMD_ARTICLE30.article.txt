## A 						Sporting Chance Basketball Rules 
### 
Basketball's all out of the way now; they almost have a team selected
to whnmp the rest oi the world in the Olympic Games. But. in the words
of John Mall, a great Daily B-ball writer ol days gone by, we'd like to
"have it around the infield just one more time."
The subject is the basketball rules for next year, announced last week
by the National Basketball Committee of the United States and Canada.
The reason we write is that oursides, the fair play boys, took a licking
from theirs ides, the manglers like SC. in the formation of the rules changes. I
'I here were four very significant rules changes made. 1) The shooting
of a lice throw on a personal foul will be mandatory. 2) During the first
minutes of the game, a player will henceforth be given a second tree
shot it lie misses the first of a one-shot foul. During the last three
minutes of the game, all fouls will draw a penalty of two free shots.
4} It fit any time a foul is clearly intentional, the fouled player will be
given two lire shots.

The effect of these rules changes will be threefold. In the first place,
stalling will diminish greatly. That we like to see. But what we don't
Ike is ihe cure that is prescribed to end the .stall under the new rules.
Suppose next .season Stanford gets a lead against UCLA and starts a
stall. All Johnny Wooden's defending champs will have to do is start I
ploying the percentages; i.e., start fouling.
The percentages show that the average Joe Casaba will likely as not
miss one of his free throws. Then the Bruins will get the ball either on !
a rebound or after a made free shot, come racing down the court, sink a i
field goal, anil find the Indian lead one point less. The time it would take j
to break up the stall would be directly proportional to the size of the i
Stanford lead.
Secondly, the new rules will greatly overemphasize the free shot. It
you think too many hall games are won on the foul line now, watch what
will occur. No coach will desire a lead to he whittled away in the manner j
described.
He'll start working his men on foul shooting until they all are as!
expert as the football automatic conversion kickers. His players will be
thinking, eating, drinking free shots, and the game will be another step
on its way to the dogs.

And finally, the manhandling tactics in basketball will receive an in
crease in emphasis. Breaking up «».alls by intentional fouling will be one
reason And the second reason will l>e maintaining a late-in-the-game
lead. Again, say Stanford is beating UCLA by a few points late in the game.
The Indians will Know they'll be fouled every time they come down !
the court to break up a stall attempt. So logically, they'll try to play the
percentages too. They won't let any Bruin get oH a floor shot as UCLA
comes hack down the court. Let the Bruins also see how many times they ;
can make two out of two free shots.
This wdl just add more emphasis to learning the skill of free shot shoot
ing Both sides will he mangling each other and permitting the foul line
percentage to decide the game.
As for the result oii spectator interest, I'd rather watch a TV western!
The conclusion lo all this is: lei the politicos come up with all the
fancy regulations they want. Until they make the personal foul more
of a penally on ihe man who fouls, and simultaneously outlaw the stall
by making it illegal for a man to hold onto the hall indefinitely, basketball
will continue on its merry way to Hell!
And it's a shame too, 'cause it's a great game. But some may console ;
themselves with the thought that the casaba game's demise will pave
the way for greater emphasis on soccer, or rugby, or lacrosse.
And with that sterling bit of indignation, let's get on with spring sports, i
YOU TELL US WHY—Look Magazine was the only one of the five
major basketball All-Americas that did not pick the great Clyde Lovellete
ot Kansas on its first team . . . Colliers committed the sacrilege of picking '
SC's Ken Flower on its District 8 (all-coast) squad over a whole mob of j
much better players . . . outstanding swimmers and trackmen seem to |
come from under every bush like rabbits in Australia when Olympic years j
come around.
