# Baseballers Host Strong Mustangs
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
In an attempt to snap their four
fame losing streak. Stanford's base
ballers face a strong Cal Poly nine
at the Sunken Diamond at 3:15 p.m.
today.
The Mustangs from San Luis
Obispo are currently engaged in a
five - game tour against Northern
California college and service
teams. Yesterday afternoon they
faced Cal in Berkeley.
Not too much is known about Cal
Poly except they have won their
only two games of .the season. They
i rushed Pomona and then shut out
Camp Cooke. This last game is
probably a tip-off as to the Mus
tangs' strength, as virtually all
tor vice teams this season are loaded
with ex-professional and semi-pro
stars.
As for Stanford, Coach Everett
Dean will be searching for a hurler
who can hold down opposition runs.
I/t absorbing their four defeats
again; t Fresno State and UCLA, the
Indian rnoundsmen were clubbed
for a total of 38 runs. It is a severe
: train on the batters if their pitch
er.? are giving up an average of
more than nine runs a game, al
though it must be said that Stan
ford's batsmen have more than
done their share in the run-pro
ducing department. Jack Shepard,
Chuck E segian, Warren Goodrich,
and Jack Skillman have all hit the
ball hard in recent games.
This afternoon's tilt against the
Mil: tangs will serve as a last prep
for Saturday's game against Cal.
This will be a battle to climb out of
the CIBA basement as the Bears
lo.'t their first two games to Santa
Clara's undefeated Bronco-.
