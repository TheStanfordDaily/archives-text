# Many PCC Basketball Division Records Fall
## 
### 
A number of PCC basketball
records were set this season by both
the northern and southern division
teams. UCLA, Washington, and
Stanford led the pace-breaking.
In the Southern Division, UCLA
broke the old season scoring record
of 744 points, tallying 788. only to
be topped by Stanford, which scored
793 points.
A shooting percentage of 37.6 per
cent by the Indians was good
enough to break last year's 35.8
mark set by USC. As many Stan
ford fans would expect, the Tro

jans set a new record for personal
fouls, their 314 easily topping the
old record of 284. set by UCLA last
season.
Another record easily broken was
Stanford's being fouled 328 times,
breaking their last year's record of
288. Despite their high shooting av
erage from the free throw line, the
Indians missed topping the old rec
ord in this department â€”by one
tenth of a per cent!
In the Northern Division, the
Huskies and Bob Houbregs led the
record-setting. Despite the fact the.

big Washington center missed three j
games due to injuries, he still broke j
the old scoring record by 19 points,]
tallying 251. He also led the league
in shooting with a 45:5 overage.'
