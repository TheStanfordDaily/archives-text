# ROUND AND ABOUT
## Fabled Doodles Weaver Sparks Humor While Studying Psychology—as USC 
### JIM MADISON 
April Fool's Day has trolled j
around again and with it comes
news of humorous occurrences
and hoaxes on other campi.
Heading the list is the irrepres- !
sible Doodles Weaver, who has I
turned up in the treacherous role of J
a part-time student at USC. In his
current occupation Doodles is re- j
ported to have quieted down con
siderably from the fabled gagstei
he was at Stanford and for Spike
Jones.
However, you wouldn't think so
from talking to Doodles him elf.
The Daily Trojan quotes him as
follows: "I enjoy my psychology
courses, but for the fir.-t several
days the class didn't know whether
1 was a patient or a student. Now
we've got things straightened out. >
They think I'm the patient."
As if to add insult to his old
Stanford loyalties, Doodles, known j
officially as Winstead Sheffield, is
contributing a column, entitled |
"Doodlin' with Doodles," to Warn- J
pus, the Trojan humor magazine, j
which has recently reappeared on j
the SC campus.
lICTI'IIOUS TEXAN — Univer
sity of Texas has turned up a char
acter, rather a whole family, that
compares favorably with Stanford's
well-known Warren G. Wonka.
It all started in 1949 when a
couple of enterprising law students j
installed a distinguished - looking j
bust in the Law Library and labeled
it "William Gray Johnson, LL.D."
The story grew that Johnson was.
a famous old prof who lectured at
Texas back around 1902.
Since one of the students who j
perpetrated the hoax was editor of i
the Law School Annual, he inserted i
a picture in the book of a certain
"William Gray Johnson III," sopho
more grandson of the prof.
The gag was passed on from edi
tor to editor until this year young
Willie is due to graduate without
ever having attended a class.
And just to add the final elabo
rate touch, a fictitious "Wi.liam :
Gray Johnson Foundation for Legal |
Education" bought a quarter-page I
ad in the annual offering congratu
lations to the law students.

cal Communist front organization.
He wont around campus attempt
ing to drum up interest in the for- j
mation of a local cell for the group, j
"The League of Progressive Youth j
for a More Liberal Democracy."
While most of the people ap

proached expressed negative inter
est once they found out that the
nasty, mean Communists were be
hind the organization, 42 per cent
were not even that interested.
When a tentative list of speakus
was mentioned, a typical reaction
was: "I'm not very intere.sted in

tint political stuff.''

the name of Karl Marx as a speak
er. The answers were: "That's nice"
and "Why, he's dead, isn't he?"

lICTI'IIOUS TEXAN — Univer
sity of Texas has turned up a char
acter, rather a whole family, that
compares favorably with Stanford's
well-known Warren G. Wonka.
It all started in 1949 when a
couple of enterprising law students j
installed a distinguished - looking j
bust in the Law Library and labeled
it "William Gray Johnson, LL.D."
The story grew that Johnson was.
a famous old prof who lectured at
Texas back around 1902.
Since one of the students who j
perpetrated the hoax was editor of i
the Law School Annual, he inserted i
a picture in the book of a certain
"William Gray Johnson III," sopho
more grandson of the prof.
The gag was passed on from edi
tor to editor until this year young
Willie is due to graduate without
ever having attended a class.
And just to add the final elabo
rate touch, a fictitious "Wi.liam :
Gray Johnson Foundation for Legal |
Education" bought a quarter-page I
ad in the annual offering congratu
lations to the law students.
