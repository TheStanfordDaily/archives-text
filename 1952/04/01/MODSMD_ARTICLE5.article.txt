MILWAUKEE, Wis., March 31
(UP) A record one million vot
ers are expected to turn out to
morrow to decide the fate of four
Republicans and three Demo
crats in the important but be
wildering Wisconsin presiden

reported high in an election that
offered these imponderables:

mitcd, whether any strength for
Gen. D wight 1). Eisenhower will
he expressed in votes for Harold
E. Stassen or California Gov. Earl
Warren. Eisenhower is not on the
hallot.
2. Whether Democrats will vote
for two pro-Truman candidates,
who now have no standard-bear
er, or give their ballots to Sen.
Estes Kefauver.
I). Whether Democrats will fol
low their tradition (if crossing
over to the Republican race to
influence the GOP choice.
The GOP race was regarded as
particularly crucial for Sen. Robert
A. Taft of Ohio, who has been over
shadowed by Eisenhower in New
Hamp hire, Minnesota, and Maine.
Taft confidently predicted vic
tory for himself. He gave as his
yardstick the capture of at least
20 of the 30 GOI* delegates at
stake.
Both Stassen and Warren have bid
openly for the votes of Eisenhower
sympathizer's to rive Wisonsin Re
