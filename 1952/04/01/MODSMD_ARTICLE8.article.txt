## 
### 
Two Palo Altans died yesterday
i and another was ill as the result
of eating poisonous mushrooms col
i lee ted in the foothills back of Stan-
I ford.
The dead were John Edward
! Smith Jr., 24, and his sister, Edith
! M. Smith. Mr-;. Louis Lacomb is re
| covering in Palo Alto Hospital.
Their doctor explained that the
Smiths apparently ate either the

deadly amanita or the destroying
angel varieties —the most poisonous
types of mushroom. He said death
results in about 80 per cent of such
poisoning cases.
Mr:;. Lacomb and her husband
were believed to have eaten mush
rooms of the mascarine variety—
less deadly than thofe the Smiths
ate, but extremely poi'onous. Mr.
Lacomb was only slightly ill.
