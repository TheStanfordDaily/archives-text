PROGRESS REPORT—The Alumni Association is "delighted with the progress" on the Bowman
Alumni House and is looking forward to moving its offices from Engineering corner into the new
structure this spring, according to Alumni Director Jack Shoup. Alumni, students, and faculty
will be able to tour the new building at a reception and housewarming May 3 as part of a three
day Stanford Family Spring Homecoming. Mrs. Guy Bowman, who with her husband was co
donor of funds for the house, will make a special trip from her home in Reno for the reception.
