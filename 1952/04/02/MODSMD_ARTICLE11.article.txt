OMAHA, Neb., April 1 (UP) A
■■Irong write-in vote put Sen. Robert
A. Taft into a lca«l in Nebraska's
primary election tonight as Sen.
Estcs Kefauver hekl an edge over
Sen. Robert Kerr in return;; in the
Democratic race.
Stassen and Eisenhower : ee~
sawed in and out of second place in
the C»OP voting which Taft has led
all the way. Both Taft ami Eisen
hower were write-in candidate:;,
while Sta sen was on the ballot.
Kerr and Kefauver, two Demo
cratic Senators battling it out for a
chance at the 1952 nomination, were
running closer, but the Tennessee
lawmaker had a : mall margin.
The combined write-in vote of
Taft and Eisenhower was more than
was cast for all other Republican |
candidates, but Stassen was appar
ently gaining slowly in a state
where he has won the last two picf- |
crence primaries.
In the confuting "second choice" :
vote, Stassen led all (.i()P candi- |
dates by a substantial margin. Kerr |
and Kefauver were almost even.
The many write-in votes, plus a [
full slate of candidates for tw I
Senate seats, four House 'eats,
state house ofbci and nearly 100 j
candidate'; for delegates, delayed
returns long past normal hours.
The weather was crisp and sunny |
in each of 2,05K precincts in !!.'!
counties until mid-afternoon, when
a few local scattered showers devel
oped in the central part of the state.
The light rains apparently did not j
low down voters as the estimate of
the vote was revised upward to
ward .'!00,000, which would be the
fourth highest in primary history.


ANXIOUS WAITING- Taft, wearing a ten-gallon hat rjivon him
in Texas, looks clour as he awaits the election outcome in Wis
consin. The election was described as one ol the mosl exciting
held in flio Badger slate in recent years.
