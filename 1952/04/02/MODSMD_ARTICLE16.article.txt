"Poison oak has flared into flower J
around the Farm, and the Stanford ;
Health Service is worried. The
number of cases reported to date
has reached "epidemic proportions,'
Dr. George C. Houck, director of
the Health Service, stated yester
day.
None of the cases have been se
riou.-, he added. Poison oak is the
most common skin disease brought
to the Health Service's attention
and the number of complaints has
reached a new high.
As a warning to students, Dr.
Houck described the dangerous
plant as a spreading shrub two to
six feet lugh. The green leaves
grow in clusters of three and are
two to four inches in length. The
flowers, which bloom from April to
May, are greenish white and hang
with the leaves.
