# Stevenson May Play It Smart
## 
### 
Illinois' able Governor Adlai Stevenson con
tinues his steadfast refusal to be a candidate
for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Stevci.'Son backers who expected the governor
to .Announce mis willingness contingent on the
Truman picture have disappointed thus
lar m Ins &ilenre, but continue to bank on a draft
ai the- july convention,
Stevenson's candidacy would probably be
acceptable to both factions of the Democratic
party. He has an able record as governor of
Illinois, His meticulous administration and
sparkling clean government stand out in bol.l
relief to the real and alleged corruption ol the
fn.mau administration.
What the Democratic paity will need il it
is to have any chance of success in the No
vember elections is a ieally top-1 light can
didate, something that is lacking thus lar.
Kefaiiver, though able, is a politico,! non
entity except lor his TV ciime crusade.
Russell is not considered a really serious
threat. Though he is populai iu the South, the
strength of the Fail Dealers and the northern
r-ivil rights-liberal wing ol the party would
probably block his nomination, Senator Kerr,
we can't quite take seriously.
Against Eisenhower, out in front in the rare
for the GOP nomination, Stevenson would
stand probably more chance than any other

Democrat, Against Taft, lie might well be the
victor.
It is probable, say many Democrats, thaf
Stevenson would accept a draft. Bat drafts are
difficult to maneuver. Especially when rivals
have announced and have been out stumping
and rounding up delegates. Stevenson is play
ing it sm«ut. Relatively young as presidential
aspirants go, he stands an excellent chance to
land the nomination in eight years or even four.
It would hike a lot of political (juts to buck
an Eisenhower boom, which is shaping and
growi ru/ and almost bursting as we approach
the nominating conventions. And if Eisen
howei is nominated, he might well be on the
long end ol the longest pie elect ion odds to
win in November in recent political history.
Dewey included. Not a pleasant prospect lor
a Democratic nominee.
As a defeated candidate, Stevenson would
cast in the role of another A 1 Smith and his
chances for the next nomination would be dim.
The governor may be the best available can
didate, capable ol strong leadership within and
outside tlie party, but he may play it smart.
You can't blame him.
Hut we'd just like to see a high caliber
Democtat like Stevenson stand up and slug
ii out, even it his opponent is a Dwight Eisen
hower who can slug right back and hard.
