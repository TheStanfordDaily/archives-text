### DICK McLEAN 
Those who report for their registration hooks
at an appropriate hour and follow the proced
ure outline are assured thai they may complete
their registration with a minimum of waiting.
—Stanford Time Schedule,(l'age 28)
I only believed the above words once and that was
the first time I enrolled. I realize that on paper it is
a simple, orderly, and logical procedure to complete
the quarterly registration requirements. Hut paper
i' one tiling and reality another. And how!

It's the morning of registration.
Your name happens to begin with
thr> letter scheduled for eight
o' n ' ick. Your alarm clock re
mil,ds you of the fact by explod
ing violently at seven- thirty. You
squash the sound as you would
a hug and then make tin! first
decision of every day. "Shall 1
get up or just doze a few minutes
more?" Yon close your eyes to
think about the matter. (It helps

concentration.) "Don't go away, Sweetheart," your
bH whimpers to you seductively, "put your head hack
on my snowy bosom and we'll just talk this thing
over.''
"No," you .shout to Lhe soothing persuasion of your
bed. "No, I'm going to be strong willed, I'm going
to register today.'' You leap from the warm clutches
of the covers and stagger off to breakfast thinking
that eight o'clock is a hell of a time to start off (ho
quarter. Arid Spring Quarter at thai.
You wait your turn in the snaking line outside
Mem And to wait your turn inside Mem And where
you stand in the line to finally get your ieg book.
You give the 11 your blue card and ask for your
grades. "Oh, no, no, no," she smiles, "you haven't
paid your library fine, you naughty person. Co over
and take care of that and then you can have your
grades."
"What library fine?" you mumble lo yourself as
you walk out the door. "There was thai time that
I kept the hook out of the reserve hook room for
twenty minutes too long."
"That will he three dollars," says the girl in the
cage with the. stacks of money piled around her.

"Hut I only . .
"We add a bit if you're late," she explains sweetly.
Ami then she adds in an off-handed manner, "1 was
just reading in the paper about the new draft quotas.
It says . .
When you walk away with your wallet three bucks
lighter, you hear her counting softly, "Nine hundred
and ninety-nine thousand . . . oh goodie, that makes
an even hundred thousand."
lly the time you get back to Mem And your letter
group is passed so you have to wait until three thirty.
You decide to liyure out your courses to kill the time.
Somewhere is the evil genius who put everything
you want to take at 11 o'clock, lie is a mad mathe
matician who calculates those things. Alter changing
your major twice you get it all figured out and set
neatly in its place. Five years isn't so long to spend
in college.
Finally you do get your reg book. You take it
over to your advisor who decides that you c;*i just
as easily switch "Quantitative Analysis" for "Flas
ket Weaviriy 1" at 11 o'clock with no trouble. You
agree with a sick grin on your lips and a fond fare
well to the lake and the sun and all things beautiful
for this quarter.
In the multi-paged hook you sign your name 4t»
times, your University residence 25 times, your
home address I!) (iines, your mother's name 8 times,
your father's name (> times, and answer varied
questions in triplicate.
Perhaps you didn't notice it but the next to last
page in the book reads, "1 hereby promise to give
my body to the Stanford Medical School when I die.
Signed ." (That'll teach you not to
sign youi' name without reading the document care
fully.)
The last formality before finishing up is to sign
the class lists. At the end of a long line you're greeted
with, "I'm sorry but the only class that isn't lull is
'Quantitative Analysis.' You'll have to see Mr. Bont
worth and Mr. Endinkle personally. Their offices are
across Quad in rooms . . ."
"Miss, how much does it cost to register late?"
"Three dollars."
"Cheap," you scream as yon claw your way
through the people and out into the sunli&ht,
"cheap at fifty times the price."

Those who report for their registration hooks
at an appropriate hour and follow the proced
ure outline are assured thai they may complete
their registration with a minimum of waiting.
