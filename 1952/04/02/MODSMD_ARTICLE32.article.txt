## Protests Spring Show Selection 
### 
To the Editor:
The following is an open letter to the Ham's Head
Committee in charge ot producing the Spring Show:
This is about a matter which is of some concern to
me and to some ten other Stanford students. For we
are the students who submitted scripts and music
in the Spring Show contest.
As has been announced in the Daily, the Ham's
Head committee in charge of producing the Spring
Shew this year has chosen Finian's Rainbow. I feel
that 1 am speaking for the rest of tho e who hove
submitted manuscripts, as well as for myself, when
1 say that, this decision on the part of Rani's Head is
deceitful, dishonorable, unfair, and uncalled for.
Whether or not my own particular shows—l sub
mitted two—merit production, as compared with the
rest ol the shows submitted, is not important. What
is important is that Ram's Head held a contest, the
winner of which by implicit agreement should lie
among those who competed 'the authors ot Finian's
liainbow were not contestants.
The argument current is that none of the shows
submitted was. in the opinion of the committee, good
enough to produce. This is a matter ol taste and of
unfair comparison wholly. I am sure that all of us
who entered the contest confident that one ot our
shows would be selected agree that these shows
which we submitted are not even close in quality
to Finian's Rainbow. Such a comparison is not only
unfair, hut to make i-l and to base action on it is
deceitful.
'Hie Ham': Head committee, furthermore, has acted
very dishonorably in its relations with us contestants.
1 for one, and I have been told likewise by a number
of others who sub ■ nit ted shows, have not as yet. even
been informed officially by the committee in regard
to the outcome of the contest. I, like the others, liAve
had to consult the Daily lor this information, this
..n the committee had already made its decision
and had prepared to art upon it two days alter the
contest closed last quarter, namely on Wednesday,

March 53. This much was passed on to me secretly
and I knew of the decision unofficially on the Thurs
day morning following.
The entire situation is thoroughly uncalled for.
Ham's Head might have informed us by phone or by
mail they weir able so to contact us to arrange
appointments for our musical presentations. They
might have stipulated explicitly in the terms of the
contest the real nature of the contest. Last year I
entered the competition with one of my shows and
v/as told that il came in a very close second. This
yeai lhe director himself has told me that my later
entry, the one I wrote this year, is even better than
last year's. In a competition strictly among shows
ot thp grade of previous Spring Shows, then, my more
recent entry at least is eligible. And any of the other
shows submitted this year may be hettei than mine.
1 suggest, on the basis nf the behavior of Ham's
Head, not only relating to this present issue, but
relating to similar issues that have come up in the
past in regard to Spring Show contests, that there be
an Kxconi investigation. The present action, as well
as the past, by Ram's Head represents a misuse of
student facilities. We may as well t all in professional
actors, and professional directors, to do the job in
comparably better.

(Fdilor's note: Fd I.a Peiie, President of Knot's
Head, commented as follows when informed of Mr.
Weil/man's letter: 'J can only say that absolutely
no politics entered into the selection of this year's
Spring Show. The selection committee's decision
was that none of the student-submitted scripts
merited production, Some were in obviously poor
taste, tubers were immaturrly written. Others
calh.il fur casting that was impossible. The Spring
Show is a production involving some 2(10
students, and the selection committee fell it would
be unwise in view of this to produce any of the
(bow . submitted this year. A sincere effort was
made and is still being? made to contact authors of
iciipts and explain the circumstances.)
