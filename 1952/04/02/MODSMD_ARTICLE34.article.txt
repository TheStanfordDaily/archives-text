# '5 Fingers' Is 'Neat' Cloak-Dagger Movie
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
'Tivo Fingers," now at the Stanford, is a neat demonstration ol
the heights a spy picture can achieve when Hollywood puts its
mind to the matter. Never lagging for a moment ol its solid two
hour running time, the film's excitement depends on a minimum
of bizarre external factors - no grotesquely suspicious invalid

types, for example, nor
cliar.rr, through deserted amusement
parks—and proceeds almost entire- ;
ly from the characters themselves.
As a matter of fact, every pitfall 1
of the typical cloak - and - dagger j
yarn is skillfully avoided. We know j
always just what Diello, the spy, is ]
(loin;;, how he is doing it, and how j
close he is to being caught. With- '
out holding hack information, with- I

ing to violence
or invoking the
usual suspense

which never releases its grip.
The movie is based on L C. I
Moyzisch's book, "Operation Cic- J
c.-o," the true account <il' a fabu
lous spy who, as valet to Britain's |
ambassador to Turkey, coolly mi
crofilmed such top secrets as the j
minutes to the Teheran Confer- J
ence and the plans for the Allied
invasion of Normandy, and sold
them to the Ocrinans al (.'20,000 a

never quite overcame their sus- j
picions that Diello was a British
plant, and so never put the in- j

of Hollywood's best. Michael Wil- I
son, who lately shared an Academy j
Award will) Harry Brown for the j
scripting of "A Place in the Sun," ;
has written an intelligent, always |
literal/" 1 , often witty screen play.
And Joseph L. Mankiewicz, of "A
Letter to Three Wive:." and "All
About Eve," has directed with his i
customary style and elegance.
From his stars, as from his sup
porting players, he has drawn
performances which achieve a
high degree of subtlety ami fi
nesse. Those who have bewailed
the James Mason of recent years
will be pleased to note thai his
acting as Diello returns to the
level he exhibited in "The Sev
enth Veil" and "Odd Man Out."
As a financially destitute Polish j

It would he unfair, of course,

action, filmed against authentic
backgrounds in Ankara and Is
tanbul, is 'always compelling, and
the insight we are given into the
characters of the people involved

As an added attraction, the voice
of Edith Piaf is heard singing its
j way in and out of the whole picture.
It is just this sort of thing that not

Fingers" its richness at«! makes it
j the superior film it is.
