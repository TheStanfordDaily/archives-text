# TRACK STAR
## Taylor Out For Rest Of Season 
### LARRY CAHN 
Stanford's track chances received
a jolt yesterday when Wil Taylor
v/as declared out for the season.
Taylor, a <110 veteran, has been suf
fering for two seasons from bono
chips in his right foot. Two opera
tions have failed to ease the pain,
v/hieh is similar to that caused by
an arthritic condition.
Despite Taylor's loss, the picture
nevt i thele s remained bright as the
Indians propped for their coming
rof'H with tiie Olympic Club this
Saturday in the Stadium. Maury
1' i' (ins. who came in second last
week against the Spartans, did a
10.1 hundred.
Bob Magoo, the junior who
ruia/id with a 0.7 ceritufy last
v/' . k has been working on the 220
low hurdles. He has been getting
h teps in order and at present is
not concentrating on breaking rec
ord
A welcome addition to the weak
pole-vaulting department is Jim
Melndoe, who yesterdya made his
fir I appearance on the track this
spring. Melndoe was out last year
and cleared the 12—ft. G-in. mark
three times. He could be a help as
top man now, with the exception of
Bob Mathias who doesn't concen
t•i!'l on vaulting, is Bob Meyers
who hovers around the 12 - foot
mark.
The Olympic Club, which
dropped a nice* to California last
week .will bring down to the Farm
f.ucli piominent as Gay Bryan, Bud
Hell, I/.-w Davis, all ex-Cards, and
< 'lniek Hanger, Don Brooks, and
any others who seem eager for
competition come aturday.


HANGS UP THE SPIKES —Wilbur Taylor, Stanford's best 440
man, has been forced to give up track for good due to a foot
injury that failed to heal. Taylor has had the injury since high
school.
