# SAB Denies Fund for Crew
## 
### 
The SAB has rejected a plea from
the Stanford Crew Association for
expense money to cover costs o!
competing in the 1952 Olympic try
outs .it Worcester, Mass.
The orphan oarsmen had request
ed a $3,000 supplement to their pri
vate budget, $2,000 to meet Olympic
tryout costs and $1,000 to help meet
additional insurance expenses and
running costs. Only by competing
at Worcester can a college crew
become eligible for the Olympics.
Despite the additional income
from the large football crowds and
the Rose Bowl, the SAB stated that
they were afraid of setting a prece
dent by aiding the Indian oarsmen
in their Olympic bid.
