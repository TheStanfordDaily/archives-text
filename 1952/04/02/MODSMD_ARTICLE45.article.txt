## The 						Stanford Daily TROUNCES CAL POLY New (lard 'Murderers' Row' Poles Out Three Homers 
### MIKE HUDSON 
Chuck Essegian and lack Shepard made Stanford baseball his
tory yesterday afternoon as they pounded three homers over the
left field wall of the spacious Sunken Diamond, while Stanford was
scoring a 13 to 3 win over Cal Poly.
Onlv 15 home runs have been hit over the walls of the Sunken

Diamond so that yesterday's trio was*
20'/( of the total output in over 400
games in the Diamond. Essegian is •
the only man ever to hit two in one , j
game. Shepard has now hit three
and so he is the all-time record- t ]
holder.
Essegian and Bruce Cameron, last
year's third-baseman, are the only
men who have hit two. Assistant i
Coach Bill Allhouse prophisied that .
Stanford's cut rent crop of fence
busters would hit a few more hom- (
ers this year.
Stanford jumped off to a one run
lead on a single by Warren Goodrich
and an error, but Cal Poly knocked
Rog Osenbaugh out with a three run
outburst in the second.
In the bottom of the third, Esseg
ian pounded his blast thirty feet to
the right of (and ten feet higher |
than) the big 3UO loot sign in left j
field.
The Cards iced the game in the t
fourth with five runs. Big blow of j
the frame was Essegian's second blast j
over the same spot. Two mates j
scored before him. Shepard singled '
in the other two runs of the inning. |
Joe Chez pitched the third j
through fifth innings and got the |
win. He gave up one bleeder hit
and loked very effective. Bob
Murphy finished up. He also al
lowed hut one hit and was handi- (
capped only by a lack of control.
Three Card double-plays helped
bespectacled Bob immeasurably.
In the eighth, the carnage con
tinued when Shepard unloaded a
long high two-run homer near the
left-field line.
The third and fourth of Cal
Poly's parade of pitchers also sur-

rendered four walks, a single to
Kay Swart/, and a triple to Art
Ahrahamson in the big six-run
| eighth.
Shortstop Warren Goodrich col
; leeted three hits, and Swartz, Ab
[ rahamson, Shepard, and Essegian
i two each. The win ended a four game
I losing streak, but yesterday's show- j
I ing gives promise of better things to j'
I come.

The Cards iced the game in the t
fourth with five runs. Big blow of j
the frame was Essegian's second blast j
over the same spot. Two mates j
scored before him. Shepard singled '
in the other two runs of the inning. |
Joe Chez pitched the third j
through fifth innings and got the |
win. He gave up one bleeder hit
and loked very effective. Bob
Murphy finished up. He also al
lowed hut one hit and was handi- (
capped only by a lack of control.
Three Card double-plays helped
bespectacled Bob immeasurably.
In the eighth, the carnage con
tinued when Shepard unloaded a
long high two-run homer near the
left-field line.
The third and fourth of Cal
Poly's parade of pitchers also sur-

rendered four walks, a single to
Kay Swart/, and a triple to Art
Ahrahamson in the big six-run
| eighth.
Shortstop Warren Goodrich col
; leeted three hits, and Swartz, Ab
[ rahamson, Shepard, and Essegian
i two each. The win ended a four game
I losing streak, but yesterday's show- j
I ing gives promise of better things to j'
I come.

Chuck Essegian and lack Shepard made Stanford baseball his
tory yesterday afternoon as they pounded three homers over the
left field wall of the spacious Sunken Diamond, while Stanford was
scoring a 13 to 3 win over Cal Poly.
Onlv 15 home runs have been hit over the walls of the Sunken

Diamond so that yesterday's trio was*
20'/( of the total output in over 400
games in the Diamond. Essegian is •
the only man ever to hit two in one , j
game. Shepard has now hit three
and so he is the all-time record- t ]
holder.
Essegian and Bruce Cameron, last
year's third-baseman, are the only
men who have hit two. Assistant i
Coach Bill Allhouse prophisied that .
Stanford's cut rent crop of fence
busters would hit a few more hom- (
ers this year.
Stanford jumped off to a one run
lead on a single by Warren Goodrich
and an error, but Cal Poly knocked
Rog Osenbaugh out with a three run
outburst in the second.
In the bottom of the third, Esseg
ian pounded his blast thirty feet to
the right of (and ten feet higher |
than) the big 3UO loot sign in left j
field.
The Cards iced the game in the t
fourth with five runs. Big blow of j
the frame was Essegian's second blast j
over the same spot. Two mates j
scored before him. Shepard singled '
in the other two runs of the inning. |
