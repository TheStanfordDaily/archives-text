# JV's Meet Menlo JC
## 
### 
Hoping to improve a rather sub
par season, the Bruves lace the
; Menlo JC nine tomorrow on the
! Menlo diamond.
This spring, the Braves have won
! but one game out of the live they've
I played. That was a lacing handed
to We.st Contra Costa JC. In their
I other- encounters, the jayvees fell
j before San Mi'teo JC. Mission High,
' Santa Rosa JC, and CCSF.
The Braves' main weakness so
i far, which is quite different from
the woes of their big brothers, is to
get more batting punch. None of
the Brave stickers have been able
to consistently hunch tUeir hits.
Several top hitters, however, have
| been Terry Evans, Syd Hall, Bill
j Schiedecker, and Marty Killings
i worth.
On the brighter side has been the
| performance of the Brave but lers,
l Ron Boyer, Gil Duncan, Dave Free-
I man, and Ray Highsmith.
The Braves' attack suffered an
j other blow yesterday when center
i fielder Tony Stellar turned in his
| uniform. Stellar, who clouted the
longest homer of the year in the
I game with CCSF, is a pvo-rned
I student and cannot be free in the
I afternoons.
