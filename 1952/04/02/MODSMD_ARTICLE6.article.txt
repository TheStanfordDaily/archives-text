## kimble Blasts Africa Myth 
### 
y Tropical Africa is no longer the
'' 1 backward area that most of us in
'' the "modern" world think it is.
y Dr. George H. T. Kimble, presi
dent of the American Geographic
l ~ Society, showed by colored slides to
a large Tuesday Evening Series au
- dieiiee in Memorial Auditorium last
it niuht that this statement is very
.[true. "Today ignorance of Africa
:s Ii , perilous and blameworthy," he
said. "One main reason is that
gl Africa is no longer ignorant of us."
nj Most of I lie Africans on the Gold
Coast live belter than people behind
- | the Iron Curtain, according to Dr.
n Kimble. His slides showed a strati
is j licatioii of economic classes not too
! different from that of our own. The
upper levels live very comfortably.
i. If one did not know that the
a. title:; were of Africa, be might very
n I well believe that they showed
i-!fcenes in California or other parts
of the United States. The terrain
ranges from line beaches to scenic
| plains and hills.
Cattle raising and agriculture are
; important industries, and vast, min
eral resources lie ready to be
I lapped. In many ways the Africans
have showed more progress and
t l wisdom than we have, according to
Dr. Kimble.
Important in Africa's progress is
! the fact that it is the Africans
i themselves who are doing the most
; to build up their countries.
