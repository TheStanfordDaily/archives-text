# Public Relations Committee Plans Revitalization
## 
### 
Harvey Segail, director of the
Public Relations Committee, said
last night he is starting immedi
ately on a program to revitalize
his committee in a report to Ex
com.
He stated two general purposes of
the committee â€”to promote better
public relations "within the Stan
ford family" and with Stanford and
the outside public; and to assume
tasks "of general benefit of the
ASSU."
A main function of the cornmittsa
will continue to be an aid to csmpus
groups in planning publicity, he said.
He described several specific proj
ects, now underway or planned for
spring quarter. Those included:
1. A social file, listing places avail
able in this area for social affairs and
available entertainment.
2. An activities booklet listing all
campus organizations and their
functions.
3. A file for reports of previous
activities (drives, social affairs, etc)
with comments and suggestions to
aid those planning the activity tho
next year
4. Newsletters to members of the
Palo Alto community with informa
tion on campus activities as a
"friendly gesture across El Camino."
b. High school programs acquaint
ing seniors with college life through
talks by Stanford students.
Segall also said a poster-maknig
committee is being formed and a
mimeographing department is
planned
He pointed out one of his biggest
difficulties is personnel. A program
to recruit interviews for posts on
the committee will begin soon, he
said. Nancy Erwin and Dave Curry
were appointed to assist Segall, in
conducting interviews.
