# BULL SESSION
## Thursday Roundup 
### PETE GROTHE 
PRIVACY. Tony Thompson, an Encina freshman,
has the moxie, papes, and know-how to go up in
this world. And lie hasn't wasted any time starting.
During finals last quarter, Tony had trouble find
ing .1 place to study. iiis roommates kept disturbing
linn, the lights in the main hbe were too dim, and the
, c r _ .-vvod bookroom was loo noisy. So what did
Tony do? He got into the elevator in the Cuhberley

building. Jan it up to a spot be
iweeri the second and third floors,
: nd pulled t!ie emergency stop.
Then he took out his books and
' tudied jh solitude. Thereby
forcing arthritic grad students
and professors to climb the stairs.
How many students would
tliink ol' .studying in an elevator?
A3 we say, Tony Thompson is
point; up in the world.
~itCHU>S DEPT. Tli ere a>-e '

r:..ny students on campus who do a Herculean
amount of work in student activities and get very
littk- credit. I'd like to single out two right now . . .
Di» k Weisman and Phil Saeta, chairmen ol the For
<ris.«n Scholarship Committee. It's largely because of
th< e two and the UK that Stanford was presented
thi- higlily-covetod Freedom Award.
MAILP.AU DEPT. A bull sessioner always gets
h'-tteri . . . flattering and deflating. At the end of
last cjuarter, 1 received a postcard from a gentleman
m.mod Fat Quayle. Mr. Quayle, who it, an individual
ist iii.tV ' most emphatic meaning ol the word, wrote
the fjM iWinj note (in prodigiously beautiful pen
mc i' hip) in response to my crusade last quarter:
Boronda Farm, from behind the Cow
Pastures of Stanford University
Dear Pf to:
Passing a :tack of Dailys 011 my way through the
campus. 1 picked one up and was greatly amused
by your crusade against language requirements. It
i-; very gratifying to find someone who thinks about

the same as I thought 36 years ago! I was a sheep
herder when 1 entered Stanford in 1916, and I'm
still a sheepherder!
I horrified the faculty by not wanting to prepare
for any profession. "All I want is to learn all 1 can
scientifically about, life and the universe, and I haven't
any time to be wasted upon foreign languages I'll
never use."
1 registered just before the post-Jordan regime
clamped on a lot of "cultural requirements."
World War 1 and three years with the American
Museum's Scientific Expedition to the South Seas
interrupted my academic life, but in 1924, I obtained
my B.S. without one hour of foreign languages!
Traveling half way around the world I've justified
my youthful opinion by quickly learning Polynesian
and Arabic while in those lands. One month with
foreigners is better than four years with a professor
of a foreign language. To thoroughly enjoy travel
ing one needs to know all one possibly can learn
about the natural sciences, geography, geology, and
history ol the world.
After- 30 years of study, some teaching, a lot of
exploring, museum and university research, J re
turned to sheepherding to enjoy my accumulated
knowledges of how the world ticks, just as I had told
dumbfounded faculty that I would do once 1
had assimilated their information.
J am not wealthy, but who wants wealth? I en
joy life around my sheep ranch with no wars or
taxes oi struggle to survive better than the Joneses
bothering me and no useless foreign languages oc
cupying my brain cell;-.

DON'T BE HALF-SAFE. Everett Dean, baseball
coach, was offered $100 to have his name connected
with a national advertisement concerning a f.pray
deodorant. The company wanted Dean to testify that
his athletes always used this particular deodorant
after games. So they would be socially at ease on
campus
Dean, a man with a conscience, turned down the
$100.
