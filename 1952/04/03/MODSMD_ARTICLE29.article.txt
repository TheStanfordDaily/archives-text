## Ram's Head Policy 
### 
To the Editor:
In order to clear up any misunderstanding about the
Tv.ir's Head Spring Show policy 1 jm sending this
o):en latter to any and all concerned.
Ram's Head as an organization has three respon
â€¢ ibilitios to the students. They are as follows
!. To give student creative talent a chance to
work in the various fields of the theatre in
the form of writers, directors, actors, singers,
dancers, designers, and technician-,
To give this talent something uf educational
value worthy of their time and effort.
3. To preront the student audiences with a pro
duction that will justify the expense of their
time and money.
Ran. s Head gives the student writers a chance by
holding an annual Spring Show con le . t. It is, how
ever made clear to all writers at. the beginning that
Rain's Head is under no compulsion to produce a stu
dent : how that does not enable them to meet their
< '..her re ponsibdities to the actors, singers, etc., by
choosing a show worthy of their effort.
When the work of the student authors does not
enable Ram's Head to meet their other respon
sibilities, a show must be chosen that will or Ram's
Head has defeated its basic purpose.
This year the student scripts did not approach
this basic standard. Therefore Finian's Rainbow
has bf' n r,elected as the 11*52 Spring Show.
It i:- out belief that this policy produces the great
est ncod f or the greatest number.
A sincere effort has been made to reach all the
authors and unfortunately this information reached
Mr Weitzman after he had written his letter. Hp
lijs now stated, however, that he is in accord with
this policy.

(Editor's Note: Ron Weitzman confirmed his ac
cordance with Rani's Head policy as stated in the

shove letter. His one qualification, however, is that
although he now feels an investigation of the or
ganization is unnecessary. Rani's Head should make
explicit its policy in future spring show contests so
the purpose of the competition will not be defeated
by di:>t:om aging other students from submitting
their scripts.)
