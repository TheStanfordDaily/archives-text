# Posters and Prizes

### 
To the Editor:
I view with concern and a certain degree of alarm
the situation which v/as brought before the public
in yesterday's letter from Ron Weitzman.
As fai as 1 have been able to determine, Ram's
Head i not planning to award the $200 in prizes which
they offered in posters displayed prominently on
Quad and in living groups last quarter. Granted that
these posters did not say that the prize-winning book
and score would be produced, although this was more
than tactily implied. It, is my opinion that Ram's
Head is morally, il not legally, bound to award these
prizes. Furthermore, they should do this if they do
not want to stifle student effort entirely. How many
scripts will be entered next year if prospective
authors and composers know they will be in com
petition with Rodgers and Hammerstein, Cole Porter,
and Irving Berlin?
tt is obviously to late now for Ram's Head to re
verse its decision with regard to the show which will
be presented this year. However, it can act in good
faith and assure that production of Broadway shows
will not become a yearly necessity.
I, and 1 am sure there are others, have always
enjoyed the Spring Show becaues it has been a Stan
ford Show from start to finish. When I want to see
the work of professionals, I have ample opportunity
in San Francisco and even Palo Alto.
