# JV Trackmen Begin Season on Saturday
## 
### 
Hampered by a lack of practice and injuries to several key per
formers, Stanford's junior varsity trackmen will open their season
this Saturday in a triangular meet with Sacramento and San Ma
teo JC.
Coach Ray Dean is concerned especially with two events and

j| i , quite likely that he will have
to forfeit places in them. They are
the high hurdles, in which Gerry
\Vood is bothered by a bad leg, and
the high jump, where Maury John
son is a doubtful entrant.
Probably the strongest event lor
(he Braves will be in the pole
vault, where Jim Mclndoe easily
clears 12 It. <i, while John Crowdtr
was a 12-It. performer in high
ci/'liool. Also strong are the 440
and the mile. Hob Garrett has run
a 1 2 quarter, while Hill Fergu
son chugs the four laps in under
*40. Jim Sec-bo Id with a 21-(J broad
jump takes care ol that department.
The sprints are characterized
more by quantity than quality, with
no one below 10.2 in the 100. With
more practice, however, Coach
Dean hopes to get more speed out
of Keith Brownsberger and Alan
vlendel.
Two erstwhile varsity performers
v/ill be seen in jayvee suits on Sat
urday. They are Drew Terramorse
and Don Carlson. Drew is far from
peak condition and hopes to run
himself back into shape, while
Carlson spent last quarter on the
idrlines due to ineligibility. If lie
makes a good showing in the JV
wÂ°el it is quite likely that he will
be moved up to the varsity.
