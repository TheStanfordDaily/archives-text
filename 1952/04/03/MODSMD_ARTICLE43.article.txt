# Golfers To Have Busy Weekend
## 
### 
Stanford's golfers will have their i
first big dual 'meet Saturday' morn- j
ing at 9 when they meet Cal's !
squad. Tomorrow at 1 p.m., Stan
ford tangles with Camp Pendleton.
Both matches will be at Stanford.
Seven Card golfers are shooting
sizzling golf, but there arc only six j
spots on the team. Art Schroeder
and Grant Spaeth will shoot off for
sixth position this morning. The
loser will probably become the
strongest JV golfer in the country.
The winner will join Fred Brown,
Dick McElyea, Paul Palmquist, and
Dick Taylor in the varsity battles.
The Camp Pendleton team is a

compelte question mark. Cal Poly,
a very weak team, defeated them,
but they heat the strong Cal team.
Perhaps their strength depends on
who happens to be on leave on
match days.
Cal's golfers are no strangers to
Stanford. They trailed Stanford by
eight strokes in last week's North
ern California Intercollegiates. Bert
White and Ted Engs lead them.
They are fine golfers, but it's
doubtful whether they can hold
Stanford's oh-so-steady combina
tion of Fred Brown and Dick Mc-
Elyea.
Stanford's powerful JV's also

I play three matches this week. To
i day at 1 p.m., Cal Poly meets the
j Brave swingers. Tomorrow at 1.
they meet Lowell High, and Sat
urday, San Francisco City College.
Coach Finger was unable to an
nounce a definite starting line-up,
' as he will start men seven through
j twelve on the ladder which changes
daily. Roland Conklin, Charles
Stark. Bob Teitsworth, Otis Win
ters, Stu Rhodes, and the loser of
the Schroedcr-Spaeth match appear
to be the team as of now. Keith
Beekman, Bob Blackburn, and John
Roberts might also be among the
starters.
