## SAB Turns Down Card Crew Again 
### LARRY CAHN 
We had hoped that Mr. Masters
and the SAB would have their heart
strings softened by lavish Rose
Bowl receipts and subsequently
purse strings would be a bit loos
er. But this is not the case, as indi
cated by the most recent refusal of
the SAB to grant the annual plea
of the Stanford crew for funds to
cover trips East.
The crew had requested $1,000
for the national meet in New
York sln/.tlv after school closes
and an additional $2,000 to allow
the squad to remain in the East
for the Olympic trials to he held
in early It now appears
that the crew will only he able to
make Ihe nationals. And that on
their own funds.
Not only have funds been refused
through the SAB but all campus
appeals have been prohibited by
University officials. So once again
the burden is right square in the
laps of the boys themselves. And
we somehow feel that they will get
the money. The crew and the wom
en's Crew Auxiliary have enough
incentive and drive to do just about
whatever they put their staunch
hearts into. That has been proven
But it does seem a pity that the
University will not aid what well
might be the only true amateur
sport on the Farm.

We have an anniversary to cele
brate today. It was 22 years ago
today, April 3, 1930, that the Im
mortal Twenty-one recovered the
Stanford Axe from California, which
had maintained possession of it ever

since 1899 when Berkeley students 1
stole it following a baseball game.
After four years of careful
planning, the 21 Stanforditcs took
the Axe right from under the
noses of California frosh hv a i
clever scheme which included
such comic hook devices as fake j
cameramen, tear gas bombs, and
get-away cars.
The Axe was being returned to i
its bank vault in Berkeley follow
ing its display at a California rally.
When the armored car pulled to a !
stop at the bank. Stanford "cam
eramen" asked California guards to
step back, so a picture could be
taken of the Axe and it.s cus
todian. And as the smiling guards j
stepped back, a blinding flashbulb
went off. the custodian was wrestled
to the ground, and the Axe was re
layed from hand to hand until it
reached the get-away roadster. A
thrown tear gas bomb helped to
quiet over-eager Berkeleyites. And
the Stanford Axe was on its way
back to the Farm.
A car parked by the conspirators j
so it blocked immediate pursuit and |
shouts of "Let's organize at the

Campanile!" sufficiently delayed
any chase. Fifty minutes later the
Axe was back in the hands of jubi
lant Indians.
Si> todav we tin our hats to the
Immortal Twenty-one who, after
:Â»() years of frustrates attempts by
Stanford plotters. succeeded in
bringing the Axe home.
