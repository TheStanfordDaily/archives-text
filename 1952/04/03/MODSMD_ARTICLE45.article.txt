### ELMORE SEEDS 
A smooth running Zeta Psi five
ouclassed Kappa Alpha II 58-39 last
j night in the Pavilion, thus advancing
j into the second round of the annual
j intra-mural basketball tourney.
The winners jumped to an early
! I!)-10 lead, increased the margin to j
| 33-21 at half, and were never there- j
after seriously threatened.
Sam Morley with 16, John Sime
j with 13, and Ron Garver with 9 i
j points led the winners, while Bob [
! Teitsworth and Connie Cox with ten I
I points apiece were outstanding for
I the losers.
KA II took a short-lived 4-0
lead at the outset of the contest as j
Skip Bush and Arnold Ilaims
dunked consecutive lay-ins. Sime
| and Morely retaliated quickly, j
however for the Zetes on identical ,
one-handed howitzers from way j
out, to knot the count. The win
nres then forged in front 11-4 on |
the strength of buckets by Bill
Thursby, Sime, and Garver, an
ex-varsity man, and a free throw
by Jim Pollock.
The two clubs traded buckets un
til the count reached 17-10, where
upon Garver dunked a sensational
! driving lay-in off the last break, to
up the Zete margin to nine. At this
juncture KA II rallied briefly as
Teitsworth and Miles, hit one hand
ers and Cox dropped two gift tosses,
countered only by a long push shot
from the corner by Morely, as they
| closed the gap to 21-17.
Immediately, successive baskets by j
Barbeau, Morely, Sime, and Bar
beau again sparked a Zete spurt j
I that widened their lead to twelve, i
| the half-time margin.
Sime, Pollock, and Morely paced [
I the winners in a quick flurry at the
| start of the second stanza which put j
| them ahead 45-27. Both clubs traded
J baskets fairly evenly thereafter
i until the finish.
Kappa Alpha II fought gamely ,
throughout but were unable •to
compete with Morely, Sime Pollock,
I and Barbeau on the boards nor stop
! the speedy Garver and Thursby on
j fast breaks.
Ed. Grad. V topped Fiji II 33-19 j
in another first round game at the |
Encina Gym.
Jim Blackwell was high for the j
j game and the winners with nine [
