# Cal Acquires ‘Big Brother’
## 
### RUBY BERNSTEIN 
The University of California ha' t
acquired a Big Brother and they |
don't like it, or so it seems from an
editorial that appeared in the Daily
Cal last week.
The Big Brother is a "contact
man," ;i help-r from the State Un-
American Activities Committee.
Last week UC and nine Southern
California campuses at a conference
in Los Angeles got themselves the
helper.
As a means to combat Commu
nistic activity on their campuses, !
each of the schools will report its !
subversive activities to the state
committee through a contact man, j
appointed bv each school to keep
the committee informed on what ;
the Communists are doing on i
campus.
Senator Hugh M. Burns (D..
Fresno), chairman of the state com
mittee, explained the duties of the
contact man: '"If we have informa
tion about a Communistic front or
ganization moving to campus, we'll
contact the 'contact man,' or if a
notorious front-joiner is seeking a
position we'll inform the college on
that man. We're not trying to set
up a Gestapo."
I»ut the Dai'v Cal doubts the
function of the contact man. who .
would report to the state all lev
els of suspected Communistic ac
tivity from the student ranks j
through the faculty and adminis
tration. "The contact man will
function as a spy." The paper
doubts that th? Senate committee,
as shown from its past record, i
will be able to recognize, prevent,
or remove subversive groups k
They believe that the small
amount of Communistic activity ;
<;ii campus will be distorted far
out of proportion.
The Big Brother, contact - man |
situation will be brought closer to
home in the coming weeks. The |
. late plans a similar conference of I
Northern California state college |
administrators, possibly to invoke
the same watchbird of Communism i
on campus.
