# Encina Is Butterless; Pranksters to Blame
## 
### 
Men eating at Encina Commons
will go without butter next v/eek
because some of them played
"flying jets" with their butter
patties.
Encina and Toyon freshmen
were told that damage to the
Commons by shooting butter at
the ceiling through straws totals
hundreds of dollars. Chief Coun
selor for Men Richard Balch told
the men that their actions in this
case were not consistent with the
Fundamental Standard and would
mean that the freshmen using the
dining hall as a whole would have
â– to pay for the damage. This* was
the frosh's second warning.
Balch and Miss Geneva Connor,
director of Encina Commons, ad
dressed a meeting called by Mar
co Vitulli, president of Encina,
Tuesday night in the massive En
cina lounge.
Miss Connor said that damage
done by the butter throwing has

already co. t $900 and that En
cinaites would foot the bill indi
rectly in their quarter's food fare.
Carrying out dishes was ako
mentioned as a factor contribut
ing to higher meal costs at the
dining hall. Loss of dishware was
said to run into thousands of dol
lare each year.
Following the meeting resi
dent:. of the two halls discussed
the matter and then through the
two halls' Excoms voted to pay
for the damage by going without
butter for several days next
week.
Raich -also scotched a rumor
that Encina would be used for
the last time this year when he
asked men not to damage the
hall at the end of spring quartet
lie said that the hall would have
to be used for several years as
there are no funds available at
this time to construct new living
quarters or remodel the present
stucture.
