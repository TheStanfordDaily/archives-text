### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford's men of the diamond
will try to climb their way out
of the CIBA collar at the expense
of their cross bay rivals, Cat, /!: 113
; p.m. tomorrow dt the Sunken Dia i
I mond.
Stanford lost two contest:. lo UCLA i
last weekend while Cal was drop- I
pine a pair to Santa Clara, 'that
makes the Bear:, and Indians eo
dwellers of the basement, and the
! team that loses tomorrow will find
i it very difficult to battle its way to i
! title contention.
Dean lias tentatively selected
j lanky Osenbaugh, a right
haiiHeH curve bailer from Sacra- I
| itienUi, to start Joe Che/. tho
| control artist from Mefortl, Oregon, |
will £ct first call if Osenbaugh runs
into (rouble. Behind him is proitm- j
I ing iVlike Acker.
Probably start my pitcher lor Cal ;
will be Ed Mayer, a tall, .slender ;
j product of San Francisco's Lowell |
| High school.
Batting stars for I lie Bears are j
j right fielder Tom Pollack, who batted j
I in seven runs against Cal Poly, Tom
I Keough, a fleet left fielder; Bob
! Albo, a basket bailer turned catcher,
I and shortstop Dick Anient.
The Indians will I'eld a starling
lineup for their initial CIBA b'»ir?e ,
came of Jack Shepard at catcher,
Osenbaugh at pitchcr, Jim Agar,
Art Abrahamson, Warren Good- j
rich, and Ray Swart/ in the infield,
and Charley Essegian, Dick Cole,
and Hal Skillman or Dave Rosen
! kraut/ in the outer gardens.
Lefty Hal Skillman will bat against
! right handed pitching and "Rosie" j
j will go against the port-siders.
Against the Bruins it was a matter J
, of all hit, no pitch. Those who have j
seen Osenbaugh, Chez, and Bob J
' Murphy pitch know that they can
be the most stingy hurJers in t! e
league. But as yet. they haven't hit i
their stride. Chez, who burned up
the league in his sophomore year,
has completely recovered from a
broken knuckle and looked very
j effective in pitching some scoreless
relief ball on Monday.
Sbcpard is living up to his advance
j notice as being perhaps the best
I hitter in Stanford baseball history
j and will be heavily counted on to
morrow. Soph Ray Swart/., who
I has been toying around with a few
positions, finally has found his niche
j at third.

will £ct first call if Osenbaugh runs

will be Ed Mayer, a tall, .slender ;

Batting stars for I lie Bears are j
j right fielder Tom Pollack, who batted j
I in seven runs against Cal Poly, Tom
I Keough, a fleet left fielder; Bob
! Albo, a basket bailer turned catcher,
I and shortstop Dick Anient.
The Indians will I'eld a starling
lineup for their initial CIBA b'»ir?e ,
came of Jack Shepard at catcher,
Osenbaugh at pitchcr, Jim Agar,
Art Abrahamson, Warren Good- j
rich, and Ray Swart/ in the infield,
and Charley Essegian, Dick Cole,
and Hal Skillman or Dave Rosen
! kraut/ in the outer gardens.
Lefty Hal Skillman will bat against
! right handed pitching and "Rosie" j
j will go against the port-siders.
Against the Bruins it was a matter J
, of all hit, no pitch. Those who have j
seen Osenbaugh, Chez, and Bob J
' Murphy pitch know that they can
be the most stingy hurJers in t! e
league. But as yet. they haven't hit i
their stride. Chez, who burned up
the league in his sophomore year,
has completely recovered from a
broken knuckle and looked very
j effective in pitching some scoreless
relief ball on Monday.
Sbcpard is living up to his advance
j notice as being perhaps the best
I hitter in Stanford baseball history
j and will be heavily counted on to
morrow. Soph Ray Swart/., who
I has been toying around with a few
positions, finally has found his niche
