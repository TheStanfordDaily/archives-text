PARIS G "ii. I)wiglil D. Eisen- j
hower's national campaign mana- j
ac, Srn. Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.. J
today hrugged off claims of Sen.
Robei t A. Tafl of a "major victory"
in Tuesday's primary elections in I
Wiscun. in and Nebraska.
Me said Taft's weakness as a j
vote-getter was exposed in Wi con- j
sin where, in spite of an intensive j
campaign and the backing of the |
Republican .state organization, he j
was able lo get only about two
fifths of the Republican vote.
Of Nebraska he said:
"When you think of the tremen
dous organizational effort and the
amount of money poured into Ne
braska. and when you consider that j
voters had to spell the write-in j
names correctly to be counted, it
was more a spelling bee than a
popularity contest.
