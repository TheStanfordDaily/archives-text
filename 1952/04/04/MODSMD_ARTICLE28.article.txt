# BULL SESSION
## More Resolutions... 
### DICK McLEAN 
At the beginning of Winter Quarter 1 wrote a set
c,l resolutions for students. Judging by the sky
rocketing grades of the last quarter, I thought I'd try
it again only this time for professors. I lirmly believe
that if these resolves are fulfilled, Student-Faculty
harmony will overflow in these distracting weeks
cf Spring Quarter.
The resolutions are:

i) I resolve not to take daily £
attendance. My motto shall be, j
"If a tudent misses me, 1 won't '•
miss him."
?) 1 resolve to speak slowly and ?
distinctly. I will not mumble nor \
grumble nor blow my nose while
i am talking.
3) I resolve to bear in mind that,
my course is not the only course
bring taken by my students. I
will remember that, at most, my

chr.s comprises one third of the student's time. I
shi.ll make assignments accordingly. I will either
f"h;uinate the third required book or twenty pages
o! the hundred and twenty page paper. (I'll let the
kids have a little play time.)
4) I resolve not to require my friend's text hooks
a\ well as my own. (That is, unless they extend the
:ame courtesy to me.) I will not lecture directly from
rny book since it is obvious by now most Stanford
students can read. Nor will 1 keep grinding out
third and fourth editions to my book no matter how
mu"h the bookstore offers me. What is more, 1 will
not i:e!l autographed and underlined copies of my
own book for excessively high amounts.
I>) I resolve to write my own tests. I will not teach
one course and let my reader write a test for another
course. I will even look at the test after they are
corrected. I will not use IBM (automatic syllabus)
that are written, corrected, and designed for
IBM machines.
(i) J will be sweet tempered and considerate at all

limes. 1 will not raise my voice to disturb llio.se who
are taking a little rest during my lectures. II a stu
dent goes to sleep, I shall just try twice as hard to
penetrate his subconscious mind. Thus by using
psychology I will drive my points home with added
vigor and impact.
7). When I post office hours, I will keep them. 1
will no longer lock the door, stretch out on the deck
and "play dead" when some confused student knocks
on the door. I will keep a fresh supply of cookies,
coffee, high-balls and ice in my office for mild re
freshment during these conferences.
8) I will not shout or rant when a student asks a
question in class. 11 I don't know the answer, I'll
admit it gracefully.
9) I shall teach my course according to the weather.
On sunny days I will deliver the unimportant and
irrelevant lectures. On the rainy days when there i.s
nothing better to do, I will cram in the meat of the
course.
10) I will not object if I see any of my students
reading the "Daily" in class. I will be philosophical
anil say, "It's good to see that the kids are taking
an interest in contemporary things." (If I can't out
bull the Bull Session, 1 11 turn in my Ph.D. union
card and go to work for Standard Oil.)
11) 1 resolve not to clobber my sleep-saturated
classes with pop quizzes on Monday morning, in
fact, I will give no pop quizzes at all. If possible,
1 wiil give no tests at all.
12) 1 resolve, finally, to remember that this is
springtime. 1 shall try to recall the attitudes and
times of my own far off youth. I will realize that this
is the last Stanford Springtime for many of my stu
dents who are saying "goodbye" to the gentle bucolic
life. When I see the words "Graduating Senior?" on
a biuebook, I will wield my red pencil with mercy
and compassion.
13) 1 will cut this out, sign my name, and post it
on my wall as a guide for a happy and profitable
Spring Quarter both for myself and the student body.

At the beginning of Winter Quarter 1 wrote a set
c,l resolutions for students. Judging by the sky
rocketing grades of the last quarter, I thought I'd try
it again only this time for professors. I lirmly believe
that if these resolves are fulfilled, Student-Faculty
harmony will overflow in these distracting weeks
cf Spring Quarter.
The resolutions are:

i) I resolve not to take daily £
attendance. My motto shall be, j
"If a tudent misses me, 1 won't '•
miss him."
?) 1 resolve to speak slowly and ?
distinctly. I will not mumble nor \
grumble nor blow my nose while
i am talking.
3) I resolve to bear in mind that,
my course is not the only course
bring taken by my students. I
will remember that, at most, my

chr.s comprises one third of the student's time. I
shi.ll make assignments accordingly. I will either
f"h;uinate the third required book or twenty pages
o! the hundred and twenty page paper. (I'll let the
kids have a little play time.)
4) I resolve not to require my friend's text hooks
a\ well as my own. (That is, unless they extend the
:ame courtesy to me.) I will not lecture directly from
rny book since it is obvious by now most Stanford
students can read. Nor will 1 keep grinding out
third and fourth editions to my book no matter how
mu"h the bookstore offers me. What is more, 1 will
not i:e!l autographed and underlined copies of my
own book for excessively high amounts.
I>) I resolve to write my own tests. I will not teach
one course and let my reader write a test for another
course. I will even look at the test after they are
corrected. I will not use IBM (automatic syllabus)
that are written, corrected, and designed for
IBM machines.
(i) J will be sweet tempered and considerate at all

limes. 1 will not raise my voice to disturb llio.se who
are taking a little rest during my lectures. II a stu
dent goes to sleep, I shall just try twice as hard to
penetrate his subconscious mind. Thus by using
psychology I will drive my points home with added
vigor and impact.
7). When I post office hours, I will keep them. 1
will no longer lock the door, stretch out on the deck
and "play dead" when some confused student knocks
on the door. I will keep a fresh supply of cookies,
coffee, high-balls and ice in my office for mild re
freshment during these conferences.

question in class. 11 I don't know the answer, I'll

:ame courtesy to me.) I will not lecture directly from
rny book since it is obvious by now most Stanford
students can read. Nor will 1 keep grinding out
third and fourth editions to my book no matter how
mu"h the bookstore offers me. What is more, 1 will
not i:e!l autographed and underlined copies of my
own book for excessively high amounts.
I>) I resolve to write my own tests. I will not teach
one course and let my reader write a test for another
course. I will even look at the test after they are
corrected. I will not use IBM (automatic syllabus)
that are written, corrected, and designed for
IBM machines.
(i) J will be sweet tempered and considerate at all

limes. 1 will not raise my voice to disturb llio.se who
are taking a little rest during my lectures. II a stu
dent goes to sleep, I shall just try twice as hard to
penetrate his subconscious mind. Thus by using
psychology I will drive my points home with added
vigor and impact.
7). When I post office hours, I will keep them. 1
will no longer lock the door, stretch out on the deck
and "play dead" when some confused student knocks
on the door. I will keep a fresh supply of cookies,
coffee, high-balls and ice in my office for mild re
freshment during these conferences.
8) I will not shout or rant when a student asks a
question in class. 11 I don't know the answer, I'll
admit it gracefully.
9) I shall teach my course according to the weather.
On sunny days I will deliver the unimportant and
irrelevant lectures. On the rainy days when there i.s
nothing better to do, I will cram in the meat of the
course.
10) I will not object if I see any of my students
reading the "Daily" in class. I will be philosophical
anil say, "It's good to see that the kids are taking
an interest in contemporary things." (If I can't out
bull the Bull Session, 1 11 turn in my Ph.D. union
card and go to work for Standard Oil.)
11) 1 resolve not to clobber my sleep-saturated
classes with pop quizzes on Monday morning, in
fact, I will give no pop quizzes at all. If possible,
1 wiil give no tests at all.
12) 1 resolve, finally, to remember that this is
springtime. 1 shall try to recall the attitudes and
times of my own far off youth. I will realize that this
is the last Stanford Springtime for many of my stu
dents who are saying "goodbye" to the gentle bucolic
life. When I see the words "Graduating Senior?" on
a biuebook, I will wield my red pencil with mercy
and compassion.
13) 1 will cut this out, sign my name, and post it
on my wall as a guide for a happy and profitable
Spring Quarter both for myself and the student body.
Signed and Duly Sworn to:
Professor
