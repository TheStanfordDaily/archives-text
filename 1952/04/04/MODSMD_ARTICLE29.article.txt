# Foreign Scholar Seeks Peace Through Universal Language
## 
### 
Language requirement gripes?
r l l.t-re'i an easy solution, suggests
Aide. Pollastri, ASSU Foreign Ex
c iianae Scholar from the Univer
ty of Florence. Why not intro
duce an international language —
K ieranto, for example? Let all
rtiuleni.; learn one language well,
7.-itiier than several not very well.
"In a war situation we will need
the co-operation of every coun
-1 iylie elaborated, punctuating
his points with volatile eyebrows
am* hands. "Friendship is not
enough. we have to understand
each other's problems deeply."
It's impossible now," he contin
ii j. "You can't get the real mean
ing through an interpreter, and
you can't study all the languages
that there are. But everyone could
learn one language besides his
own."
An international language, he
feels, would end such ridiculous
a',fits as UNESCO and UN con
ferences with 10 delegates and 10
interpreter' - . And it would make
foreign travel much more worth
while for the average tourist, who
is no linguistic genius.
"We're in the kind of war in
which we can't live for our own
countries," he stated very seri
ously. "We must divide our lives
among every country and in ev
ery field. We must be able to talk
to the foreign people we meet."
Esperanto was developed, he said,
when French began to die out as
t)i>- international language. People
were asking why can't MY lan
guaw<i he the international language
The obvious solution was a lan
guage that was no one's own. But
the idea has been slow to catch on.
Aldo knows whereof he speaks
when discussing the difficulties of
]» .rning languages. Italian secon

dary schools require eight years
of Latin and four of Greek, along
with a smattering of either French,
Spanish, German, or English.
Students in Italy must abo
study four years of philosophy
and geography, e?/;ht of history
| and Italian literature, three of
j chemistry and physics, and at
least one year of economics, as
tronomy, mathematics, and de
' sign. American students must
have junior standing before be
! ing eligible for the first year of
the Italian language. "Yoi.v high
schools are too easy," Aldo com
mented in a tone of deliberate
I understatement.
Alter his return to Italy Aldo
j will study lor a doctorate in politi
| cal science, and hopes eventually
lor a job in the diplomatic corps.

One of the first questions ihe Stan
ford greeting committee asked him
was, "You're a poly sci major, are
n't you?"
"Oh, no, no, no, never will do,"
he insisted, much to their surprise.
"A policeman, why should I want
that?"
Commenting on the coming
United States elections, Aldo ex
pressed a point of view common
in Europe. "Leave Eisenhower
where he is. We need a popular
man as commander-in-chief of all
the European forces, a man very
popular in the United Slates and
in Europe.
"You can always find a Presi
dent, but we can't find another
commander-in-chief. And without
a man everyone will like we're
through. There is no one for us as
popular as Eisenhower."
He added, however, Hint most
Europeans aren't really as inter
ested in our elections as we are
in theirs. They feel that what
ever happens, there is no danger
of Socialism < r Conimuii'sm in
this country —an assurance that
we can't have about their politics.
In Italy, he said, there is very
little enthusiasm for the Third
Front often discussed elsewhere in
Europe. The young people particu
larly are aware that nationalism is
a thing of the past. Perhaps Italian-
American friendship is due, lie sug
gested, to the large number ol Ital
ians who have emigrated to this
country.
One of the tilings that amuse him
mo t about us is our theory that
Italians eat. spaghetti, pizza, and
ravioli, .sing operatic arias, and ski.
"I must not be Italian," he grinned."
I don't particularly like .spaghetti,
1 don't ski. and I've eaten more
pizza at Rocky's than in Italy."

One of the first questions ihe Stan

"A policeman, why should I want

Commenting on the coming
United States elections, Aldo ex
pressed a point of view common
in Europe. "Leave Eisenhower
where he is. We need a popular
man as commander-in-chief of all
the European forces, a man very
popular in the United Slates and
in Europe.
"You can always find a Presi
dent, but we can't find another
commander-in-chief. And without
a man everyone will like we're
through. There is no one for us as
popular as Eisenhower."
He added, however, Hint most
Europeans aren't really as inter
ested in our elections as we are
in theirs. They feel that what
ever happens, there is no danger
of Socialism < r Conimuii'sm in
this country —an assurance that
we can't have about their politics.
In Italy, he said, there is very
little enthusiasm for the Third
Front often discussed elsewhere in
Europe. The young people particu
larly are aware that nationalism is
a thing of the past. Perhaps Italian-
American friendship is due, lie sug
gested, to the large number ol Ital
ians who have emigrated to this
country.
One of the tilings that amuse him

"We're in the kind of war in
which we can't live for our own
countries," he stated very seri

among every country and in ev

Esperanto was developed, he said,

the idea has been slow to catch on.
Aldo knows whereof he speaks

Students in Italy must abo

least one year of economics, as

One of the first questions ihe Stan
ford greeting committee asked him
was, "You're a poly sci major, are
n't you?"
"Oh, no, no, no, never will do,"
he insisted, much to their surprise.
"A policeman, why should I want
that?"
Commenting on the coming
United States elections, Aldo ex
pressed a point of view common
in Europe. "Leave Eisenhower
where he is. We need a popular
man as commander-in-chief of all
the European forces, a man very
popular in the United Slates and
in Europe.
"You can always find a Presi
dent, but we can't find another
commander-in-chief. And without
a man everyone will like we're
through. There is no one for us as
popular as Eisenhower."
He added, however, Hint most
Europeans aren't really as inter
ested in our elections as we are
in theirs. They feel that what
ever happens, there is no danger
of Socialism < r Conimuii'sm in
this country —an assurance that
we can't have about their politics.
In Italy, he said, there is very
little enthusiasm for the Third
Front often discussed elsewhere in
Europe. The young people particu
larly are aware that nationalism is
a thing of the past. Perhaps Italian-
American friendship is due, lie sug
gested, to the large number ol Ital
ians who have emigrated to this
country.
One of the tilings that amuse him
mo t about us is our theory that
Italians eat. spaghetti, pizza, and
ravioli, .sing operatic arias, and ski.
"I must not be Italian," he grinned."
I don't particularly like .spaghetti,
1 don't ski. and I've eaten more
pizza at Rocky's than in Italy."


ALDO POLLASTRI
—"Why not Esperanto?"
Language requirement gripes?
r l l.t-re'i an easy solution, suggests
Aide. Pollastri, ASSU Foreign Ex
c iianae Scholar from the Univer
ty of Florence. Why not intro
duce an international language —
K ieranto, for example? Let all
rtiuleni.; learn one language well,
7.-itiier than several not very well.
"In a war situation we will need
the co-operation of every coun
-1 iylie elaborated, punctuating
his points with volatile eyebrows
am* hands. "Friendship is not
enough. we have to understand
each other's problems deeply."
It's impossible now," he contin
ii j. "You can't get the real mean
ing through an interpreter, and
you can't study all the languages
that there are. But everyone could
learn one language besides his
own."
An international language, he
feels, would end such ridiculous
a',fits as UNESCO and UN con
ferences with 10 delegates and 10
interpreter' - . And it would make
foreign travel much more worth
while for the average tourist, who
is no linguistic genius.
