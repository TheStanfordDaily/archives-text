# Vacation Brings Work to KZSU
## 
### FRANCES JACKSON 
Spring vacation for KZSU was
no vacation at all. Broadcasting
ceased; but the station was twice
as busy with its new work as
dubbing center for WIN and its
job of replacing lines to Branner,
Yoyon, and ihe Row.
KZSU is a member of the Inter- j
collegiate Broadcasting System, more j
easily known as IBS, which is a na- |
tionul network of college stations. I
The west coast stations are classified |
under region 10. Recently, region JO J
decided to set up a network involv- |
ing only those coast stations that
were interested. This new. network
is WIN, Westei 11 Intercollegiate j
JNptwoi k.
The six WIN stations are KZSU, ;
KEWC at Eastern Washington Col- ]
Ipge of Education, KRJC at Modesto j
J.C., KCSC at Chico State, KAEO at
COP, and KXLU at Loyola.
The WIN stations have the only j
working tape network. This con- j
sists of several series of 15 minute j
shows which are tape recorded and
sent out to the stations desiring
them. This is where KZSU has a j
vital job as dubbing center. All !
tapes are sent to them and are !
worked over. More tapes are made
if necessary and then routed to the 1
stations. The exceptional shows are i
put on discs and added to the rec
ord library.
This tape network allows all sta
tions to present shows which they

could not normally broadcast as their
own productions. Students are thus
able to hear shows from the other
stations, thus getting a more varied
| broadcast schedule.
KZSU will present several of these
shows spring quarter. At present
there are six series, three music and
three .mysteries. So far KZSU has
produced no tape shows, but a
series involving a well-known al
though fictitious campus figure as
the hero has been buzzing around in
several KZSU heads.
With so many new shows avail
able to the station, the problem
arose of getting them to the stu
dents. KZSU uses the carrier ciir
j rent operation, which involves
transmitting directly through wires
rather than through the air. This
is the system used by the major
stations. The original lines were
: pitt up in 1!)48 using assaidt wire,
normally used for covering battle
fields, not radio lines, 't his wire
just gave out.
New wire has been installed so
that persons living in Toyon, Bran
ner, and the Row houses can get good
listening on previously faulty re
j ception. It is impossible to monitor
all houses, and the station would
| appreciate any remarks on the pres-
I ent reception.

KZSU is a member of the Inter- j
collegiate Broadcasting System, more j
easily known as IBS, which is a na- |
tionul network of college stations. I
The west coast stations are classified |
under region 10. Recently, region JO J
decided to set up a network involv- |
ing only those coast stations that
were interested. This new. network
is WIN, Westei 11 Intercollegiate j
JNptwoi k.
The six WIN stations are KZSU, ;
KEWC at Eastern Washington Col- ]
Ipge of Education, KRJC at Modesto j
J.C., KCSC at Chico State, KAEO at
COP, and KXLU at Loyola.
The WIN stations have the only j
working tape network. This con- j
sists of several series of 15 minute j
shows which are tape recorded and
sent out to the stations desiring
them. This is where KZSU has a j
vital job as dubbing center. All !
tapes are sent to them and are !
worked over. More tapes are made
if necessary and then routed to the 1
stations. The exceptional shows are i
put on discs and added to the rec
ord library.
This tape network allows all sta
tions to present shows which they

could not normally broadcast as their
own productions. Students are thus
able to hear shows from the other
stations, thus getting a more varied
| broadcast schedule.
KZSU will present several of these
shows spring quarter. At present
there are six series, three music and
three .mysteries. So far KZSU has
produced no tape shows, but a
series involving a well-known al
though fictitious campus figure as
the hero has been buzzing around in
several KZSU heads.
With so many new shows avail
able to the station, the problem
arose of getting them to the stu
dents. KZSU uses the carrier ciir
j rent operation, which involves
transmitting directly through wires
rather than through the air. This
is the system used by the major
stations. The original lines were
: pitt up in 1!)48 using assaidt wire,
normally used for covering battle
fields, not radio lines, 't his wire
just gave out.
New wire has been installed so
that persons living in Toyon, Bran
ner, and the Row houses can get good
listening on previously faulty re
j ception. It is impossible to monitor
all houses, and the station would
| appreciate any remarks on the pres-
I ent reception.

manager, was up a pole this vacation stringing a new line for
better KZSU reception at Toyon, Branner, and the Row.
Spring vacation for KZSU was
no vacation at all. Broadcasting
ceased; but the station was twice
as busy with its new work as
dubbing center for WIN and its
job of replacing lines to Branner,
