# College Students' Fate Predicted In Featured Book
## 
### 
Where will the class of '52 be
twenty years from now?
Two enterprising authors, Ernest
Havemann and Dr. Patricia S. West,
think they have come up with some
of the answers in their new book,
"They Went to College," a com
prehensive survey of the 6,000,000
living college graduates.
Among their conclusions: the
straight A students will end up
with the largest fortunes, even more
than the all - round campus
"wheels." But even the C-average
graduates are likely to hold posi
tions way above average in the
country.
The average college graduate is
probably a married businessman
with at least one child, but not
many more. He's conservative, will
stay married longer than the aver
age citizen.
"They Went to College," current
ly being featured ut the Bookstore,
will be reviewed in The Daily next
week.
