# Politicos Begin Hot Campaign
## Factions Rip Demo Party 
### HADLEY ROFF 
Tiic <l"iuocirdic parly has become like a zoo gone mad since
l'ic.'iidf-ni Harry Truman snatched out the bars last Saturday night,
announcing ho will not be a candidate for re-election.
All Democratic factions spring into action, stumping for favorite
:>oll candidates while already declared candidates, such as Estes

Kcfauver, Robert Kerr, and Rich
ard added adrenalin to their
campaigns.
In In., dramatic pronouncement at.
t'i«• .lefTei son-Jackson Day dinner in
W.i ,11111;I<»11 last Saturday, Truman
declined pul licaly to single out a
t,n>-re: :«>r, declaring that he would
bach the party's choice and would
be 'in there pitching, just as if 1
were the nominee."
Adlai Stevenson
Favorite of the administration
democrats is Adlai Stevenson, the
racket ripping governor of Illinois.
When asked about his political in
tei 11 ions, Stevenson told reporters
that Truman's move "was a surprise
to in?. I'm still a candidate for gov
ernor of Illinois and nothing more."
Stevenson, however, being an
adrnil politician, hasn't ruled out the
I to:,; 111i lit y that he could be talked
into tunning when quizzed by news
men immediately following Truman's
bow-out. Asked if he would accept
the nomination if ofTered, he said,
"I'll cross that bridge when I come
to it."
According to White House sources,
Truman picked Stevenson as succes
sor early this year but was given the
brush off as the Illinois governor
asked for time to test public senti
ment. Early in February Stevenson
met with Truman in a lengthy ofl
the-i'ecord interview.
Vote Getter
Though lacking old guard support,
Senator Estes Kefauver has proven
himself the major vote getter among
Democrats so far this campaign.
II wing zoomed to public notice in
last summer's spectacular crime
hearings, the Tennessean toppled the
pollsters' apple-cart in New Hamp
shire when he bested Truman to
capture ;• 11 Democratic delegates in
the primary, March 11.
Perhaps, the Kefauver victory
painted a lx>ld warning for Truman
and prompted his withdrawal.
Having thumped Truman, Kefauv
er announced bis plan to enter every
primary possible. And so far his
primary entries have paid ofi" well.
In the Nebraska voting Tuesday,
Kefauver piled almost a two to one
margin over portly, Bible-quoting
Senator Robert Kerr of Oklahoma.
Delegate Winner
The crime-busters largest dele
pale snatch lo date has come in Wis
consin where lie rolled in an im
pressive 200,000 votes compared to
nearesl contender's 20,000 in Tues
days' polling. He was pitted against,
two Wisconsinites, Jerome Fox and
Charles Broughton, both Truman
supporters.
Thus after three primaries, Ke
fauver has safely tucked under his
coon-cap 54 of the 584 delegates
chosen by state primaries. Whether
lie can gain further primary support
and claim the backing from state
delegate conventions remains to be
seen.

Though Kefauver takes no issue
with the present administration on
matters of policy, he has sires: ed that
lie would oil administrative proced
ures which, he claims, have become
rusted with corruption. Like a teen
ager asking for his first date, Ke
fauver's platform technique is simple
and direct, a relief for many from
the chest-thumping antics of some
politicians.
Bowing Out
Apparently bowing from the Dem
ocratic race is Robert Kerr who has
maintained glum silence since his
recent defeat yi Nebraska.
The thundering headache for the
Democrats this year, as in 1918, is
the sullen South which demands the
shelving of Truman's civil rights
proposals.
Acting for the South, Georgia Sen
ator Richard Russell declared his
candidacy last month in a move that
might spell revolution in the Demo
cratic ranks. In his bid, Russell has
received the blessings of South Car
olina Governor James F. Byrnes, one
time Secretary of State under Tru
man and now the President's most,
scathing critic.
Kefauver is unacceptable to the
South because of his affirmative
stand on the Fair Employment Prac
tices Commission, part of the Ti unian
civil rights program.
South Happy
Russell upon hearing of Truman's
decision not to run expressed South
ern sentiments, remarking that the
South couldn't be happier. "I hope
it means a free convention,"he
added.
Not entered in Northern primaries,
Russell will, no doubt, muster the
Smith's 210 delegates who are picked
chiefly at party conventions.
The possible voting piill of Russell
in the North has not been tested, but
most Northern Demo leaders claim
that they never could go for the
Georgian.
In many states favorite sons are
being mentioned as possible entrants
into the political whirl, though what
degree of steam has been generated
for tliem has not yet been guaged.
Such names as Paul Douglas, Sena
tor from Illinois; Robert Jackson,
Supreme Court Justice from New
York; William O. Douglas, a Supreme
Courier from Washington have hcen
prominants suggested.
So far, public opinion expressed at
the polls has indicated that, this is
not a democratic year in the sense
that they can slip hack into office as
they did in 1948. If they are to win,
party support must be solid behind
the candidate. With the field swarm
ing with candidates and possible
candidates, such crystalization of
support has not been forthcoming.
The Democratic convention this
July in Chicago should be more in
teresting than a rioting menagerie.

pale snatch lo date has come in Wis
consin where lie rolled in an im
pressive 200,000 votes compared to
nearesl contender's 20,000 in Tues
days' polling. He was pitted against,
two Wisconsinites, Jerome Fox and
Charles Broughton, both Truman
supporters.
Thus after three primaries, Ke
fauver has safely tucked under his
coon-cap 54 of the 584 delegates
chosen by state primaries. Whether
lie can gain further primary support
and claim the backing from state
delegate conventions remains to be
seen.

Though Kefauver takes no issue
with the present administration on
matters of policy, he has sires: ed that
lie would oil administrative proced
ures which, he claims, have become
rusted with corruption. Like a teen
ager asking for his first date, Ke
fauver's platform technique is simple
and direct, a relief for many from
the chest-thumping antics of some
politicians.
Bowing Out
Apparently bowing from the Dem
ocratic race is Robert Kerr who has
maintained glum silence since his
recent defeat yi Nebraska.
The thundering headache for the
Democrats this year, as in 1918, is
the sullen South which demands the
shelving of Truman's civil rights
proposals.
Acting for the South, Georgia Sen
ator Richard Russell declared his
candidacy last month in a move that
might spell revolution in the Demo
cratic ranks. In his bid, Russell has
received the blessings of South Car
olina Governor James F. Byrnes, one
time Secretary of State under Tru
man and now the President's most,
scathing critic.
Kefauver is unacceptable to the
South because of his affirmative
stand on the Fair Employment Prac
tices Commission, part of the Ti unian
civil rights program.
South Happy
Russell upon hearing of Truman's
decision not to run expressed South
ern sentiments, remarking that the
South couldn't be happier. "I hope
it means a free convention,"he
added.
Not entered in Northern primaries,
Russell will, no doubt, muster the
Smith's 210 delegates who are picked
chiefly at party conventions.
The possible voting piill of Russell
in the North has not been tested, but
most Northern Demo leaders claim
that they never could go for the
Georgian.
In many states favorite sons are
being mentioned as possible entrants
into the political whirl, though what
degree of steam has been generated
for tliem has not yet been guaged.
Such names as Paul Douglas, Sena
tor from Illinois; Robert Jackson,
Supreme Court Justice from New
York; William O. Douglas, a Supreme
Courier from Washington have hcen
prominants suggested.
So far, public opinion expressed at
the polls has indicated that, this is
not a democratic year in the sense
that they can slip hack into office as
they did in 1948. If they are to win,
party support must be solid behind
the candidate. With the field swarm
ing with candidates and possible
candidates, such crystalization of
support has not been forthcoming.
The Democratic convention this
July in Chicago should be more in
teresting than a rioting menagerie.
Tiic <l"iuocirdic parly has become like a zoo gone mad since

men immediately following Truman's
bow-out. Asked if he would accept
the nomination if ofTered, he said,
"I'll cross that bridge when I come

According to White House sources,
Truman picked Stevenson as succes
sor early this year but was given the
brush off as the Illinois governor
asked for time to test public senti
ment. Early in February Stevenson
met with Truman in a lengthy ofl
the-i'ecord interview.
Vote Getter
Though lacking old guard support,
Senator Estes Kefauver has proven
himself the major vote getter among
Democrats so far this campaign.

Perhaps, the Kefauver victory
painted a lx>ld warning for Truman
and prompted his withdrawal.
Having thumped Truman, Kefauv

Adlai Stevenson
Favorite of the administration
democrats is Adlai Stevenson, the
racket ripping governor of Illinois.
When asked about his political in
tei 11 ions, Stevenson told reporters
that Truman's move "was a surprise
to in?. I'm still a candidate for gov
ernor of Illinois and nothing more."
Stevenson, however, being an
adrnil politician, hasn't ruled out the
I to:,; 111i lit y that he could be talked
into tunning when quizzed by news
men immediately following Truman's
bow-out. Asked if he would accept
the nomination if ofTered, he said,
"I'll cross that bridge when I come
to it."
According to White House sources,
Truman picked Stevenson as succes
sor early this year but was given the
brush off as the Illinois governor
asked for time to test public senti
ment. Early in February Stevenson
met with Truman in a lengthy ofl
the-i'ecord interview.
Vote Getter
Though lacking old guard support,
Senator Estes Kefauver has proven
himself the major vote getter among
Democrats so far this campaign.
II wing zoomed to public notice in
last summer's spectacular crime
hearings, the Tennessean toppled the
pollsters' apple-cart in New Hamp
shire when he bested Truman to
capture ;• 11 Democratic delegates in
the primary, March 11.
Perhaps, the Kefauver victory
painted a lx>ld warning for Truman
and prompted his withdrawal.
Having thumped Truman, Kefauv
er announced bis plan to enter every
primary possible. And so far his
primary entries have paid ofi" well.
In the Nebraska voting Tuesday,
Kefauver piled almost a two to one
margin over portly, Bible-quoting
Senator Robert Kerr of Oklahoma.
Delegate Winner
The crime-busters largest dele
pale snatch lo date has come in Wis
consin where lie rolled in an im
pressive 200,000 votes compared to
nearesl contender's 20,000 in Tues
days' polling. He was pitted against,
two Wisconsinites, Jerome Fox and
Charles Broughton, both Truman
supporters.
Thus after three primaries, Ke
fauver has safely tucked under his
coon-cap 54 of the 584 delegates
chosen by state primaries. Whether
lie can gain further primary support
and claim the backing from state
delegate conventions remains to be
seen.

Though Kefauver takes no issue
with the present administration on
matters of policy, he has sires: ed that
lie would oil administrative proced
ures which, he claims, have become
rusted with corruption. Like a teen
ager asking for his first date, Ke
fauver's platform technique is simple
and direct, a relief for many from
the chest-thumping antics of some
politicians.
Bowing Out
Apparently bowing from the Dem
ocratic race is Robert Kerr who has
maintained glum silence since his
recent defeat yi Nebraska.
The thundering headache for the
Democrats this year, as in 1918, is
the sullen South which demands the
shelving of Truman's civil rights
proposals.
Acting for the South, Georgia Sen
ator Richard Russell declared his
candidacy last month in a move that
might spell revolution in the Demo
cratic ranks. In his bid, Russell has
received the blessings of South Car
olina Governor James F. Byrnes, one
time Secretary of State under Tru
man and now the President's most,
scathing critic.
Kefauver is unacceptable to the
South because of his affirmative
stand on the Fair Employment Prac
tices Commission, part of the Ti unian
civil rights program.
South Happy
Russell upon hearing of Truman's
decision not to run expressed South
ern sentiments, remarking that the
South couldn't be happier. "I hope
it means a free convention,"he
added.
Not entered in Northern primaries,
Russell will, no doubt, muster the
Smith's 210 delegates who are picked
chiefly at party conventions.
The possible voting piill of Russell
in the North has not been tested, but
most Northern Demo leaders claim
that they never could go for the
Georgian.
In many states favorite sons are
being mentioned as possible entrants
into the political whirl, though what
