# Taft, Eisenhower Spur Rip Roaring GOP Race
## 
### 
The rip-roaring Republican
race for the presidential nomi
nation has been narrowed to two
candidates, forthright Senator
Robert Taft and the smiling Kan
san, General Dwight D. Eisen
hower.
When the ballots were counted
last Tuesday in Wisconsin and Ne
braska it became obvious that the
men who could fetch GOP votes
were Taft and "Ike."
Though Earl Warren, California's
governor and Harold Stassen, the
ex-Minnesota chief of state, still are
in there pitching, it is a weak ball
they're heaving, and most political
observers predict that they will bow
in Eisenhower's favor at the GOP
nominating convention this July.
With the narrowing of the candi
dates race to Taft and Eisenhower,
the major issue at the convention
will be clearly defined.
Taft on the one hand, pursuing
his blunt, bitter attack on present
foreign policy, and Eisenhower on
the other, advocating the continua
tion of such Truman proposals as
the North Atlantic Pact, will lie
the alternatives put before the del
egates.
Entering the Senate in lOufl, Taft
was immediately recognized as
leader of what has become known
as the "isolationist wing" of the Re
publican party.
During the troubled days prior
to the bombing of Pearl Harbor,
Taft tenaciously maintained that
the United States was in no danger
of attack.
Taft voted a consistant "no" to
allied relief and military prepared
ness expenditures as he took the lead
in an attempt to crush lend lease,
the navy anti-espionage fund, and
conscription.
When the Japanese "zeros" dove
on American ships December 7, the
Ohio senator voted for a declaration
of war, but urged Congress to be
cautious of entangling treaties.
Determinedly, during and since
the war, Taft has fought hard to
prevent lend lease sales abroad, and
to block participation in the World
Bank and Fund, the United Nations
and the North Atlantic Pact.
So far this campaign Taft has con
fined himself largely to a denuncia
tion of present policy without in
timating what specific changes he
would make if elected.
Eisenhower, silenced by his job
as Supreme commander, NATO, is

thought of as a backer of Adminis
tration foreign policy. Having left
his Columbia University presidency
to assume command of the North
Atlantic defense forces, Eisenhower
is presently the key man imple
menting Truman's policy of con
taining communism in Europe.
What few remarks were made by
Eisenhower during his few months
as a civilian are shadowy and
vague. But the vigor with which
lie has tackled his present com
mand is taken as an indication of
his sentiments.
Whether he agrees with the Tru
man-Acheson schemes for Asia is
not known and will remain obscure
until his return.
On domestic issues, both Taft and

Eisenhower appear conservative. In
an interview published in the U.S.
News and World Report last week,
j Eisenhower decried the "left swing"
in American government. Taft has
always scored America's "scoialistic
trend."
Which of the two foreign policies
the delegates will favor at the July
convention is hard to predict as
politicos storm the nation in cyclonic
j prolusion.
Some hint of possible convention
j action might stem from the New
Jersey primary, April 15 where Taft
and Ike backers will clash head on.
That primary inay well be the clinch
er, deciding between isolationist Taft
and Dwight Eisenhower.

the alternatives put before the del
egates.
Entering the Senate in lOufl, Taft
was immediately recognized as
leader of what has become known
as the "isolationist wing" of the Re
publican party.
During the troubled days prior
to the bombing of Pearl Harbor,
Taft tenaciously maintained that
the United States was in no danger
of attack.
Taft voted a consistant "no" to
allied relief and military prepared
ness expenditures as he took the lead
in an attempt to crush lend lease,
the navy anti-espionage fund, and
conscription.
When the Japanese "zeros" dove
on American ships December 7, the
Ohio senator voted for a declaration
of war, but urged Congress to be
cautious of entangling treaties.
Determinedly, during and since
the war, Taft has fought hard to
prevent lend lease sales abroad, and
to block participation in the World
Bank and Fund, the United Nations
and the North Atlantic Pact.
So far this campaign Taft has con
fined himself largely to a denuncia
tion of present policy without in
timating what specific changes he
would make if elected.
Eisenhower, silenced by his job
as Supreme commander, NATO, is

thought of as a backer of Adminis
tration foreign policy. Having left
his Columbia University presidency
to assume command of the North
Atlantic defense forces, Eisenhower
is presently the key man imple
menting Truman's policy of con
taining communism in Europe.
What few remarks were made by
Eisenhower during his few months
as a civilian are shadowy and
vague. But the vigor with which
lie has tackled his present com
mand is taken as an indication of
his sentiments.
Whether he agrees with the Tru
man-Acheson schemes for Asia is
not known and will remain obscure
until his return.
On domestic issues, both Taft and

Eisenhower appear conservative. In
an interview published in the U.S.
News and World Report last week,
j Eisenhower decried the "left swing"
in American government. Taft has
always scored America's "scoialistic
trend."
Which of the two foreign policies
the delegates will favor at the July
convention is hard to predict as
politicos storm the nation in cyclonic
j prolusion.
Some hint of possible convention
j action might stem from the New
Jersey primary, April 15 where Taft
and Ike backers will clash head on.
That primary inay well be the clinch
er, deciding between isolationist Taft
and Dwight Eisenhower.
The rip-roaring Republican
race for the presidential nomi
nation has been narrowed to two
candidates, forthright Senator
Robert Taft and the smiling Kan
san, General Dwight D. Eisen
hower.
When the ballots were counted
last Tuesday in Wisconsin and Ne
braska it became obvious that the
men who could fetch GOP votes
were Taft and "Ike."
Though Earl Warren, California's
governor and Harold Stassen, the
ex-Minnesota chief of state, still are
in there pitching, it is a weak ball
they're heaving, and most political
observers predict that they will bow
in Eisenhower's favor at the GOP
nominating convention this July.
With the narrowing of the candi
dates race to Taft and Eisenhower,
the major issue at the convention
will be clearly defined.
