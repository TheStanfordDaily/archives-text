# McColl to Play for Bears
## Med Career Still Tops; Will Study at Chicago 
### DICK KLEIN Daily Sports Editor 
Once again the big No. 3 will be thrilling grid fans all over the
nation. Stanford's greatest lineman, two-time All-American Bill
McColl, has signed a three-year contract to play professional foot
ball for the Chicago Bears.
The contract was officially announced to the public over Spring

vacation only alter Bill had com-'*
pleted final arrangements w i th (
George Halas, perenial Pappa ol' the j
Bears. Actual signing took place on
March 30 at a special press-radio
conference, which was held at the
Chicago Athletic Associr.t'.on.
So, after many months of specu
lation on sports pages throughout
most of the nation, the fabulous end
finally made the move which many
football fans had hoped for, but
which had been continually denied.
Bright Future
McColl will join the famous Bear
grid dynasty, the Yankees of pro
fessional football next fall. He will
be part of Owner-Coach Halas' cru
rent youth and beef movement to
bolster the passing attack and rush
ing defense of the Loop City eleven.
Bill will play offensive end and de
fensive linebacker for the Monsters
of the Midway .Other top draft

choices by the Bears were: Jim
1 Dooley, Eddie Macon, Herm Clark,
! Dick Kazmaier, and Ed Brown.
At the conference in the East,
Stanford's Bill told Chicagoans:
"I am grateful for the opportunity
football has given me toward the
attainment of my goals in medicine,
and I certainly appreciate the won
derful cooperation the medical
schools have shown me in this en
deavor."
Behind (hat statement there is
an interesting story left untold hy
most of the papers across the na
tion of how Bill, the medical stu
dent with heart set on a medical
career, battled Bill, the football
player. It's a story that should he
told.
The fabled Indian athlete, who
handles his 230-pound, G'4" frame
with terrific speed and agility, was

a standout in high school. As a prep
at San Diego he earned All-CIF
first string honors in basketball (two
years), football, and baseball. He
also did enough booking to be in
line for an academic scholarship to
Stanford.

Competing in sports, especially
football, gives Bill great relaxation.
For him football is like golf or fish
ing or hunting to most. Unlike most
gridders, McColl doesn't find prac
tice a great drain on his energy.
Throughout his entire school career,
he made his best grades during the
playing season. His concentration
powers seem better and the regula

♦ion keeps him in a set routine.
'"I love playing football. It has
ione a lot for me. No, I am not
ired of playing after four wonder
ul years at Stanford. It has sup
plemented my studies, and the
joaches have always been fair."
But Bill had his heart set on a
Joctor's life and, at all times, that
was his main objective while on the
farm. His outstanding academic
.•areer gained early admission to med
school, where he is now winding up
the first year course.
According to Bill, he first started
.hinking about pro ball about a year
igo. Not seriously, but it had been
brought to his attention and he be
gan to kick the idea around. Ac
tually he didn't feel pro ball was
at all possible. He felt he couldn't
handle both the medical studies and
football.
He had no definite plans at all
until he was drafted by the Chicago
Bears in January. Then he was con
tacted by Halas on the phone. "Mel
Halas wondered if I would be in
terested if it would not interfere with
medical school."
Calling Dr. Fortmann
Then some serious thinking along
these lines began. Dr. McColl, Bill's
father at first reacted negatively to
the idea, as did most other doctors
and friends. In Los Angeles, Bill
had some long talks with Dr. Danny
Fortmann who presented quite a
different picture.
Dr. Fortmann, now team physician

for the L.A. Rams and one of the ,
city's leading surgeons, played many i
years under Halas. Recently he was j
picked as an all-time All-Pro guard
Dr. Fortmann, one of seven doctors
who combined medical studies while
playing for the Bears, unfolded the
behind-the-scene personality and
philosophy of George Halas.
Considered one of the shrewdest
and most successful operators in pro
fessional atheltics, Halas neverthe
less tabs pro ball not as end in itself
but a way of furthering young men
in their chosen careers. Halas feels
that his Bears are something to give
fellows a big start. He has been
known to carry ball players until
they were established in other fields j
and often works hard to get them a !
position.
According to Fortmann, pro ball
helped him immeasurably to be a
better doctor. It provided him with
enough money to devote several
extra years to research, residency,
and experience in surgery. And he
gave Bill great encouragement to
look into the matter more carefully.
Halas phoned again early in
March, this time from Phoenix,
Ariz., where he was vacationing.
He invited Bill down for a con
ference. After preliminary investi
gations, officials at the Univ. of
Chicago med school seemed very

encouraging.
At Chicago, the academic year is
divided into four quarters, in
roughly the same pattern as Stan
ford's undergraduate system. Med
students must drop studies every
fourth quarter. Most take leave
summer, but Bill learned that the
schedule could be worked to fit a
winter, spring, and summer routine.
Bear games are during the Fall in a
three-mcnth period.
The final decision was based on
two factors. 1) The three years of
pro football will enable Bill to do
post graduate work and further his
medical studies. This will be valu
able for his professional career. 2)
He likes to play football and wants
to play some more.
With Stanford cooperating with the
Univ. of Chicago, the details of trans
ferring and continuing his medical
career were worked out so that he
could finish in the regular amount of
time. The contract was limited to
three years, "because that's all that
I was interested in. Since it fit in
so nicely with the medical school
program."
As far as the new deal with the
Bears is concerned, med studies will
still come first. Halas has agreed that
in all cases, med responsibilities will
take precedence over games, exhibi
tions, and trips.

Bill is very definite in his praise of
all concerned in helping him work
out the details. "I am very fortunate.
Chicago was the only place where
arrangements could be worked out.
Univ. of Chicago officials and Ilakis
all had wonderful attitudes."
He goes on to say that "the Bears
are a wonderful team." He also
pointed out that the reason the
Bears drafted him is that they were
the only pro outfit that understood
the situation.
Sorry to Leave
"I am very sorry to leave Stan
ford. It has been wonderful to me.
The med school is one of the finest
in the country. It's just that the
opportunities were better in Chi
cago."
Looking into the future, Bill would
like to return to California, especially
the Bay Area, and intern in San
Francisco. Frankly, his first choice
would be the Stanford Lane Hos
pital. He Would also like to do ad
ditional graduate work in San Fran
cisco, and possibly practice in the
Bay Area.
Many have predicted a bright fu
ture for big Bill in pro ball. Local
fans and Stanford students will get
to see old No. 3 in action again
when the Bears play San Francisco.
Loyal Southern Cal supporters will
watch their favorite ball-player when
Bears clash with the Rums.

when the Bears play San Francisco.
Loyal Southern Cal supporters will

OLD TEAMMATES—Here's Bill pictured with ends Ken Rose and Bruce Van Alstyne back in
'49. The three flankmen talk things over with Coach Mai Elward.
Once again the big No. 3 will be thrilling grid fans all over the
nation. Stanford's greatest lineman, two-time All-American Bill
McColl, has signed a three-year contract to play professional foot
ball for the Chicago Bears.
The contract was officially announced to the public over Spring

vacation only alter Bill had com-'*
pleted final arrangements w i th (
George Halas, perenial Pappa ol' the j
Bears. Actual signing took place on
March 30 at a special press-radio
conference, which was held at the
Chicago Athletic Associr.t'.on.
So, after many months of specu
lation on sports pages throughout
most of the nation, the fabulous end
finally made the move which many
football fans had hoped for, but
which had been continually denied.
Bright Future
McColl will join the famous Bear
grid dynasty, the Yankees of pro
fessional football next fall. He will
be part of Owner-Coach Halas' cru
rent youth and beef movement to
bolster the passing attack and rush
ing defense of the Loop City eleven.
Bill will play offensive end and de
fensive linebacker for the Monsters
of the Midway .Other top draft

choices by the Bears were: Jim
1 Dooley, Eddie Macon, Herm Clark,
! Dick Kazmaier, and Ed Brown.
At the conference in the East,
Stanford's Bill told Chicagoans:
"I am grateful for the opportunity
football has given me toward the
attainment of my goals in medicine,
and I certainly appreciate the won
derful cooperation the medical
schools have shown me in this en
deavor."
Behind (hat statement there is
an interesting story left untold hy
most of the papers across the na
tion of how Bill, the medical stu
dent with heart set on a medical
career, battled Bill, the football
player. It's a story that should he
told.
The fabled Indian athlete, who
handles his 230-pound, G'4" frame
with terrific speed and agility, was

a standout in high school. As a prep
at San Diego he earned All-CIF
first string honors in basketball (two
years), football, and baseball. He
also did enough booking to be in
line for an academic scholarship to
Stanford.

Competing in sports, especially
football, gives Bill great relaxation.
For him football is like golf or fish
ing or hunting to most. Unlike most
gridders, McColl doesn't find prac
tice a great drain on his energy.
Throughout his entire school career,
he made his best grades during the
playing season. His concentration
powers seem better and the regula

♦ion keeps him in a set routine.
'"I love playing football. It has
ione a lot for me. No, I am not
ired of playing after four wonder
ul years at Stanford. It has sup
plemented my studies, and the
joaches have always been fair."
But Bill had his heart set on a
Joctor's life and, at all times, that
was his main objective while on the
farm. His outstanding academic
.•areer gained early admission to med
school, where he is now winding up
the first year course.
According to Bill, he first started
.hinking about pro ball about a year
igo. Not seriously, but it had been
brought to his attention and he be
gan to kick the idea around. Ac
tually he didn't feel pro ball was
at all possible. He felt he couldn't
handle both the medical studies and
football.
He had no definite plans at all
until he was drafted by the Chicago
Bears in January. Then he was con
tacted by Halas on the phone. "Mel
Halas wondered if I would be in
terested if it would not interfere with
medical school."
Calling Dr. Fortmann
Then some serious thinking along
these lines began. Dr. McColl, Bill's
father at first reacted negatively to
the idea, as did most other doctors
and friends. In Los Angeles, Bill
had some long talks with Dr. Danny
Fortmann who presented quite a
different picture.
Dr. Fortmann, now team physician

for the L.A. Rams and one of the ,
city's leading surgeons, played many i
years under Halas. Recently he was j
picked as an all-time All-Pro guard
Dr. Fortmann, one of seven doctors
who combined medical studies while
playing for the Bears, unfolded the
behind-the-scene personality and
philosophy of George Halas.
Considered one of the shrewdest
and most successful operators in pro
fessional atheltics, Halas neverthe
less tabs pro ball not as end in itself
but a way of furthering young men
in their chosen careers. Halas feels
that his Bears are something to give
fellows a big start. He has been
known to carry ball players until
they were established in other fields j
and often works hard to get them a !
position.
According to Fortmann, pro ball
helped him immeasurably to be a
better doctor. It provided him with
enough money to devote several
extra years to research, residency,
and experience in surgery. And he
gave Bill great encouragement to
look into the matter more carefully.
Halas phoned again early in
March, this time from Phoenix,
Ariz., where he was vacationing.
He invited Bill down for a con
ference. After preliminary investi
gations, officials at the Univ. of
Chicago med school seemed very

encouraging.
At Chicago, the academic year is
divided into four quarters, in
roughly the same pattern as Stan
ford's undergraduate system. Med
students must drop studies every
fourth quarter. Most take leave
summer, but Bill learned that the
schedule could be worked to fit a
winter, spring, and summer routine.
Bear games are during the Fall in a
three-mcnth period.
The final decision was based on
two factors. 1) The three years of
pro football will enable Bill to do
post graduate work and further his
medical studies. This will be valu
able for his professional career. 2)
He likes to play football and wants
to play some more.
With Stanford cooperating with the
Univ. of Chicago, the details of trans
ferring and continuing his medical
career were worked out so that he
could finish in the regular amount of
time. The contract was limited to
three years, "because that's all that
I was interested in. Since it fit in
so nicely with the medical school
program."
As far as the new deal with the
Bears is concerned, med studies will
still come first. Halas has agreed that
in all cases, med responsibilities will
take precedence over games, exhibi
tions, and trips.

Bill is very definite in his praise of
all concerned in helping him work
out the details. "I am very fortunate.
Chicago was the only place where
arrangements could be worked out.
Univ. of Chicago officials and Ilakis
all had wonderful attitudes."
He goes on to say that "the Bears
are a wonderful team." He also
pointed out that the reason the
Bears drafted him is that they were
the only pro outfit that understood
the situation.
Sorry to Leave
"I am very sorry to leave Stan
ford. It has been wonderful to me.
The med school is one of the finest
in the country. It's just that the
opportunities were better in Chi
cago."
Looking into the future, Bill would
like to return to California, especially
the Bay Area, and intern in San
Francisco. Frankly, his first choice
would be the Stanford Lane Hos
pital. He Would also like to do ad
ditional graduate work in San Fran
cisco, and possibly practice in the
Bay Area.

OLD TEAMMATES—Here's Bill pictured with ends Ken Rose and Bruce Van Alstyne back in
'49. The three flankmen talk things over with Coach Mai Elward.
Once again the big No. 3 will be thrilling grid fans all over the
nation. Stanford's greatest lineman, two-time All-American Bill
McColl, has signed a three-year contract to play professional foot
ball for the Chicago Bears.
The contract was officially announced to the public over Spring

vacation only alter Bill had com-'*
pleted final arrangements w i th (
George Halas, perenial Pappa ol' the j
Bears. Actual signing took place on
March 30 at a special press-radio
conference, which was held at the
Chicago Athletic Associr.t'.on.
So, after many months of specu
lation on sports pages throughout
most of the nation, the fabulous end
finally made the move which many
football fans had hoped for, but
which had been continually denied.
Bright Future
McColl will join the famous Bear
grid dynasty, the Yankees of pro
fessional football next fall. He will
be part of Owner-Coach Halas' cru
rent youth and beef movement to
bolster the passing attack and rush
ing defense of the Loop City eleven.
Bill will play offensive end and de
fensive linebacker for the Monsters
of the Midway .Other top draft

choices by the Bears were: Jim
1 Dooley, Eddie Macon, Herm Clark,
! Dick Kazmaier, and Ed Brown.
At the conference in the East,
Stanford's Bill told Chicagoans:
"I am grateful for the opportunity
football has given me toward the
attainment of my goals in medicine,
and I certainly appreciate the won
derful cooperation the medical
schools have shown me in this en
deavor."
Behind (hat statement there is
an interesting story left untold hy
most of the papers across the na
tion of how Bill, the medical stu
dent with heart set on a medical
career, battled Bill, the football
player. It's a story that should he
told.
The fabled Indian athlete, who
handles his 230-pound, G'4" frame
with terrific speed and agility, was

a standout in high school. As a prep
at San Diego he earned All-CIF
first string honors in basketball (two
years), football, and baseball. He
also did enough booking to be in
line for an academic scholarship to
Stanford.

Competing in sports, especially
football, gives Bill great relaxation.
For him football is like golf or fish
ing or hunting to most. Unlike most
gridders, McColl doesn't find prac
tice a great drain on his energy.
Throughout his entire school career,
he made his best grades during the
playing season. His concentration
powers seem better and the regula

♦ion keeps him in a set routine.
'"I love playing football. It has
ione a lot for me. No, I am not
ired of playing after four wonder
ul years at Stanford. It has sup
plemented my studies, and the
joaches have always been fair."
But Bill had his heart set on a
Joctor's life and, at all times, that
was his main objective while on the
farm. His outstanding academic
.•areer gained early admission to med
school, where he is now winding up
the first year course.
According to Bill, he first started
.hinking about pro ball about a year
igo. Not seriously, but it had been
brought to his attention and he be
gan to kick the idea around. Ac
tually he didn't feel pro ball was
at all possible. He felt he couldn't
handle both the medical studies and
football.
He had no definite plans at all
until he was drafted by the Chicago
Bears in January. Then he was con
tacted by Halas on the phone. "Mel
Halas wondered if I would be in
terested if it would not interfere with
medical school."
Calling Dr. Fortmann
Then some serious thinking along
these lines began. Dr. McColl, Bill's
father at first reacted negatively to
the idea, as did most other doctors
and friends. In Los Angeles, Bill
had some long talks with Dr. Danny
Fortmann who presented quite a
different picture.
Dr. Fortmann, now team physician

for the L.A. Rams and one of the ,
city's leading surgeons, played many i
years under Halas. Recently he was j
picked as an all-time All-Pro guard
Dr. Fortmann, one of seven doctors
who combined medical studies while
playing for the Bears, unfolded the
behind-the-scene personality and
philosophy of George Halas.
Considered one of the shrewdest
and most successful operators in pro
fessional atheltics, Halas neverthe
less tabs pro ball not as end in itself
but a way of furthering young men
in their chosen careers. Halas feels
that his Bears are something to give
fellows a big start. He has been
known to carry ball players until
they were established in other fields j
and often works hard to get them a !
position.
According to Fortmann, pro ball
helped him immeasurably to be a
better doctor. It provided him with
enough money to devote several
extra years to research, residency,
and experience in surgery. And he
gave Bill great encouragement to
look into the matter more carefully.
Halas phoned again early in
March, this time from Phoenix,
Ariz., where he was vacationing.
He invited Bill down for a con
ference. After preliminary investi
gations, officials at the Univ. of
Chicago med school seemed very

encouraging.
At Chicago, the academic year is
divided into four quarters, in
roughly the same pattern as Stan
ford's undergraduate system. Med
students must drop studies every
fourth quarter. Most take leave
summer, but Bill learned that the
schedule could be worked to fit a
winter, spring, and summer routine.
Bear games are during the Fall in a
three-mcnth period.
The final decision was based on
two factors. 1) The three years of
pro football will enable Bill to do
post graduate work and further his
medical studies. This will be valu
able for his professional career. 2)
He likes to play football and wants
to play some more.
With Stanford cooperating with the
Univ. of Chicago, the details of trans
ferring and continuing his medical
career were worked out so that he
could finish in the regular amount of
time. The contract was limited to
three years, "because that's all that
I was interested in. Since it fit in
so nicely with the medical school
program."
As far as the new deal with the
Bears is concerned, med studies will
still come first. Halas has agreed that
in all cases, med responsibilities will
take precedence over games, exhibi
tions, and trips.

Bill is very definite in his praise of
all concerned in helping him work
out the details. "I am very fortunate.
Chicago was the only place where
arrangements could be worked out.
Univ. of Chicago officials and Ilakis
all had wonderful attitudes."
He goes on to say that "the Bears
are a wonderful team." He also
pointed out that the reason the
Bears drafted him is that they were
the only pro outfit that understood
the situation.
Sorry to Leave
"I am very sorry to leave Stan
ford. It has been wonderful to me.
The med school is one of the finest
in the country. It's just that the
opportunities were better in Chi
cago."
Looking into the future, Bill would
like to return to California, especially
the Bay Area, and intern in San
Francisco. Frankly, his first choice
would be the Stanford Lane Hos
pital. He Would also like to do ad
ditional graduate work in San Fran

OLD TEAMMATES—Here's Bill pictured with ends Ken Rose and Bruce Van Alstyne back in
'49. The three flankmen talk things over with Coach Mai Elward.
Once again the big No. 3 will be thrilling grid fans all over the
nation. Stanford's greatest lineman, two-time All-American Bill
McColl, has signed a three-year contract to play professional foot
ball for the Chicago Bears.
The contract was officially announced to the public over Spring

vacation only alter Bill had com-'*
pleted final arrangements w i th (
George Halas, perenial Pappa ol' the j
Bears. Actual signing took place on
March 30 at a special press-radio
conference, which was held at the
Chicago Athletic Associr.t'.on.
So, after many months of specu
lation on sports pages throughout
most of the nation, the fabulous end
finally made the move which many
football fans had hoped for, but
which had been continually denied.
Bright Future
McColl will join the famous Bear
grid dynasty, the Yankees of pro
fessional football next fall. He will
be part of Owner-Coach Halas' cru
rent youth and beef movement to
bolster the passing attack and rush
ing defense of the Loop City eleven.
Bill will play offensive end and de
fensive linebacker for the Monsters
of the Midway .Other top draft

choices by the Bears were: Jim
1 Dooley, Eddie Macon, Herm Clark,
! Dick Kazmaier, and Ed Brown.
At the conference in the East,
Stanford's Bill told Chicagoans:
"I am grateful for the opportunity
football has given me toward the
attainment of my goals in medicine,
and I certainly appreciate the won
derful cooperation the medical
schools have shown me in this en
deavor."
Behind (hat statement there is
an interesting story left untold hy
most of the papers across the na
tion of how Bill, the medical stu
dent with heart set on a medical
career, battled Bill, the football
player. It's a story that should he
told.
The fabled Indian athlete, who
handles his 230-pound, G'4" frame
with terrific speed and agility, was

a standout in high school. As a prep
at San Diego he earned All-CIF
first string honors in basketball (two
years), football, and baseball. He
also did enough booking to be in
line for an academic scholarship to
Stanford.

Competing in sports, especially
football, gives Bill great relaxation.
For him football is like golf or fish
ing or hunting to most. Unlike most
gridders, McColl doesn't find prac
tice a great drain on his energy.
Throughout his entire school career,
he made his best grades during the
playing season. His concentration
powers seem better and the regula

♦ion keeps him in a set routine.
'"I love playing football. It has
ione a lot for me. No, I am not
ired of playing after four wonder
ul years at Stanford. It has sup
plemented my studies, and the
joaches have always been fair."
But Bill had his heart set on a
Joctor's life and, at all times, that
was his main objective while on the
farm. His outstanding academic
.•areer gained early admission to med
school, where he is now winding up
the first year course.
According to Bill, he first started
.hinking about pro ball about a year
igo. Not seriously, but it had been
brought to his attention and he be
gan to kick the idea around. Ac
tually he didn't feel pro ball was
at all possible. He felt he couldn't
handle both the medical studies and
football.
He had no definite plans at all
until he was drafted by the Chicago
Bears in January. Then he was con
tacted by Halas on the phone. "Mel
Halas wondered if I would be in
terested if it would not interfere with
medical school."
Calling Dr. Fortmann
Then some serious thinking along
these lines began. Dr. McColl, Bill's
father at first reacted negatively to
the idea, as did most other doctors
and friends. In Los Angeles, Bill
had some long talks with Dr. Danny
Fortmann who presented quite a
different picture.
Dr. Fortmann, now team physician

for the L.A. Rams and one of the ,
city's leading surgeons, played many i
years under Halas. Recently he was j
picked as an all-time All-Pro guard
Dr. Fortmann, one of seven doctors
who combined medical studies while
playing for the Bears, unfolded the
behind-the-scene personality and
philosophy of George Halas.
Considered one of the shrewdest
and most successful operators in pro
fessional atheltics, Halas neverthe
less tabs pro ball not as end in itself
but a way of furthering young men
in their chosen careers. Halas feels
that his Bears are something to give
fellows a big start. He has been
known to carry ball players until
they were established in other fields j
and often works hard to get them a !
position.
According to Fortmann, pro ball
helped him immeasurably to be a
better doctor. It provided him with
enough money to devote several
extra years to research, residency,
and experience in surgery. And he
gave Bill great encouragement to
look into the matter more carefully.
Halas phoned again early in
March, this time from Phoenix,
Ariz., where he was vacationing.
He invited Bill down for a con
ference. After preliminary investi
gations, officials at the Univ. of
Chicago med school seemed very

encouraging.
At Chicago, the academic year is
divided into four quarters, in
roughly the same pattern as Stan
ford's undergraduate system. Med
students must drop studies every
fourth quarter. Most take leave
summer, but Bill learned that the
schedule could be worked to fit a
winter, spring, and summer routine.
Bear games are during the Fall in a
three-mcnth period.
The final decision was based on
two factors. 1) The three years of
pro football will enable Bill to do
post graduate work and further his
medical studies. This will be valu
able for his professional career. 2)
He likes to play football and wants
to play some more.
With Stanford cooperating with the
Univ. of Chicago, the details of trans
ferring and continuing his medical
career were worked out so that he
could finish in the regular amount of
time. The contract was limited to
three years, "because that's all that
I was interested in. Since it fit in
so nicely with the medical school
program."
As far as the new deal with the
Bears is concerned, med studies will
still come first. Halas has agreed that
in all cases, med responsibilities will
take precedence over games, exhibi
tions, and trips.

Bill is very definite in his praise of
all concerned in helping him work
out the details. "I am very fortunate.
Chicago was the only place where
arrangements could be worked out.
Univ. of Chicago officials and Ilakis
all had wonderful attitudes."
He goes on to say that "the Bears
are a wonderful team." He also
pointed out that the reason the
Bears drafted him is that they were
the only pro outfit that understood
the situation.

He goes on to say that "the Bears
are a wonderful team." He also
pointed out that the reason the
Bears drafted him is that they were
the only pro outfit that understood
the situation.
Sorry to Leave
"I am very sorry to leave Stan
ford. It has been wonderful to me.
The med school is one of the finest
in the country. It's just that the
opportunities were better in Chi
cago."
Looking into the future, Bill would
like to return to California, especially
the Bay Area, and intern in San
Francisco. Frankly, his first choice
would be the Stanford Lane Hos
pital. He Would also like to do ad
ditional graduate work in San Fran
cisco, and possibly practice in the
Bay Area.
Many have predicted a bright fu
ture for big Bill in pro ball. Local
fans and Stanford students will get
to see old No. 3 in action again
when the Bears play San Francisco.
Loyal Southern Cal supporters will
watch their favorite ball-player when
Bears clash with the Rums.
