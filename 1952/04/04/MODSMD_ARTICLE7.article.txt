A Red Cross blood drive is sched
uled to hit Stanford April 22 and £t.
Permission slips, .'1,500 of them,
were distributed to campus bouses,
dorms, and the village last night-
Students under 21 who wish to do
nate tlieir blood in the coming drive
must Mil out the slips and send them
home to be returned with their (Cli -
ents' signatures within the next two
week.-,.
The Student Health Commit Ice
which is sponsoring tlir <hive, assist
ed by the A f'hi () Service Fratei nily,
urges that the permission slips be j
mailed home immediately to allow
sufficient time for their return. I
April 16, 17, 18. and 21 booths will
be set up at the Cellar and the Main I
Library where students may make |
i appointments for donations.

The last blood drive at Stanford
whs held last fall. Al that time a
j record breaking 'MR pint , were col
lected and about ir»n more donors
were turned away for lad* of Red
Cross facilities and time. The Red
Cross, pleased with this huge re
sponse. this month vviil set their
mobile unit up on campus foi two
flays instead of one.
Ry doubling the length of time it
will stay here the Red Cross hopes
to collect 700 pints this time. That
I means the student response now
j must he even greater than it was
j last fall,
Ihe need for blood is still great
j Korea and domestic emergencies
j are constantly exhausting the na-
I lion's fresh supply and reaching deep
I in'o the plasma reserves besides.
