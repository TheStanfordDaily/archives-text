# Language Issue Remains

### TOM NEVILLE 
Tho headache students and
faculty have lately been suffer
ing over the foreign language
reguirement marks the third
phase of a problem that has been
plaguing tho university since
before World War I.
Up until lf)!20, each undergraduate
student was enrolled in a major de
partment immediately upon bi:> ar
rival as a freshman.
/v report on "The Reorganization
of Undergraduate Instruction" w r
issued in 11)20 by a faculty commit tec
in an attempt to remedy this situa
lion.
'1 lie committee proposed a miu
imum of 22 units of one foreign
language or 15 units each of two
languages.
"It is expected that an increasingly
large number will satisfy this re
quirem'.'tit in high school," tli • re
port concluded.
These recommendations were soon
put into action and the foreign lan
guage requirement was horn. Until
the Army took oyer Stanford fil ling
the last war the requirement re
mained substantially the same.
'1 he Army's intensified language
courses at Stanford revolutionized
older teaching techniques. Aiming
primarily at training men for (he
OSS, the Army's course took three
hours of class and six hours outside
preparation daily.
Army discipline and the fact that
there was a real purpose in hack ol
the program made it tremendously
successful.

Stmh n(s after the war, however,
could not reasonably devote as
much time to the study of one
ci urse. The program was revised,
with as many of the original ele
ments retained as was possible.
The course was given for live anils,

one hour a day, plus optional two
and three unit courses in composi
tion and reading.
Next year, subject to final approval I
by the Academic Council, the lan- j
uuage requirement will again ho rc
v,imped. This time, fundamentals I

vill ho stressed in a required series
•>f thipr unit courses adding up to
13 units. Kmpha.sis on conversation
and composition, rather than reading,

two unit courses given simultane
