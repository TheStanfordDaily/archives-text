## 
### ANN THATCHER 
Orchesis' concert last night, directed by Mrs. Barbara Spcncc,
Orchesis adviser, and Joan Mouritsen, Orchesis president, showed
remarkable originality and ingenuity in the variety ot dances pre
sented, all of which were student-choreographed. Each number
was well executed to show various floor patterns, emotions, and
ideas, and the narrative element was also present.

'Merc Feathers on a Cap"
achieved decorative floor patterns
by both position and colorful cos
tume. Charmingly rakish feathers
cavorted about with so mo good
dancing and pantomime exhibited by
Helen Gaylord, choreographer. "Lo
tus Land" was a beautiful iob, done
by Joan Mouritsen, and depicted
the flight of fancy in a dream.
''With Rings and Bells," by Jo
Ann Tuttle with original music by
Ynez Lynch for the piano, clarinet,
and percussion, was a humorous
comment on the vicarious living
which dateless girls mu: t enjoy
through their girl friends.
"Suite of Moods," by Sue Cluin
and Joan Mouritsen. was accom
panied by a theremin, which is a
new, modern electronic instru
ment with a Mingle string. It was
very effective in portraying three
moods: lazy summer, spring with
its zest for living, and a dav of
endless tasks which, keep every
one busy.
"Dance of the Sacrifice" was one
of the most interesting, with color
ful background setting, costuming,
and a primitive chant to provide at
mosphere. Dorothea Cooley was
choreographer.
Joan Hunt's solo, "The Stanford
Daily," used spoken excerpts from
The Daily such as the Fro h bon
fire and "Once Around the Quad."
ft was ended with a dashing ".'50."
A delightful melodrama, "Nell's
Final Sacrifice." choreographed by
Maryelln Dzemtke and Marlene
Valentine, was accompanied by Bob
Smith, who did his own arrange
ments. The villain snatched the he
roine away, but thanks to Wild Nell,
all ended happily with Handsome
Harry saving the Lady Vere de
Vere.
"Not Here—Not Now" was ex
cellent with lh o artistic seeking
of Joan Hunt, choreographer, for
some companions. A very l>iigM
number was provided l»v the ap
prentice'-, who flid "Rondo," uti
lizing the waltz, polka, schol
tische, and mazurka.
Clever costuming, done by Ruth
Delanis and Carol Holgerson, added
to the concert as did effective light
ing, and capable accompaniment
was furnished by Wilda Reed.

its zest for living, and a dav of
endless tasks which, keep every
one busy.
"Dance of the Sacrifice" was one
of the most interesting, with color
ful background setting, costuming,
and a primitive chant to provide at
mosphere. Dorothea Cooley was
choreographer.
Joan Hunt's solo, "The Stanford
Daily," used spoken excerpts from
The Daily such as the Fro h bon

ft was ended with a dashing ".'50."
A delightful melodrama, "Nell's
Final Sacrifice." choreographed by
Maryelln Dzemtke and Marlene
Valentine, was accompanied by Bob
Smith, who did his own arrange

roine away, but thanks to Wild Nell,
all ended happily with Handsome
Harry saving the Lady Vere de
Vere.
"Not Here—Not Now" was ex
cellent with lh o artistic seeking
of Joan Hunt, choreographer, for

Orchesis' concert last night, directed by Mrs. Barbara Spcncc,
Orchesis adviser, and Joan Mouritsen, Orchesis president, showed
remarkable originality and ingenuity in the variety ot dances pre
sented, all of which were student-choreographed. Each number
was well executed to show various floor patterns, emotions, and
ideas, and the narrative element was also present.

'Merc Feathers on a Cap"
achieved decorative floor patterns
by both position and colorful cos
tume. Charmingly rakish feathers
cavorted about with so mo good
dancing and pantomime exhibited by
Helen Gaylord, choreographer. "Lo
tus Land" was a beautiful iob, done
by Joan Mouritsen, and depicted
the flight of fancy in a dream.
''With Rings and Bells," by Jo
Ann Tuttle with original music by
Ynez Lynch for the piano, clarinet,
and percussion, was a humorous
comment on the vicarious living
which dateless girls mu: t enjoy
through their girl friends.
"Suite of Moods," by Sue Cluin
and Joan Mouritsen. was accom
panied by a theremin, which is a
new, modern electronic instru
ment with a Mingle string. It was
very effective in portraying three
moods: lazy summer, spring with
its zest for living, and a dav of
endless tasks which, keep every
