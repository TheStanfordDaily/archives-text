## 
### 
NEW YORK, April G (UP)—U.S. steel charged
tonight that the CIO United Steel workers are not
intci ested in preventing Wednesday's scheduled
nationwide r.teel strike, but the union replied
that the walkout, in reality, will be a strike of in-

i dustxy against the government.
'Die charge and countercharge were
| leveled by Benjamin F. Fairless,
! president of the U.S. Steel—the na
tion's largest producer, and Phihp
; Murray, president of the USW and o£
j its parent union, the CIO.
The statement came soon after wags
stabilization board chairman Nathan
P. Feinsinger told newsmen that in
dustry and CIO officials had inten
sified their efforts to forestall the
strike by 650,000 workers at 12:01 a.m.
Wednesday, April 9.
Fairless charged that a steel strike
would benefit no one but "the iron
curtain countries" and will threaten
the military security of the nation.
Union "Not Interested"
lie said the union was not interest
ed in bargaining and wanted the com -
panies to accept without question the
recommendations of the wage stabili
zation board.
Murray replied in a statement that
Fairless' statement was a 'reiteration
of the industry's negative attitude ''
"The industry under the leadership
of Mr. Fairless went to Washington.'
Murray said. "It submitted its car.-*
to 'lie government. The wage stabili
zation board acting for, and on behaU
of, the American people made recom -
mendations. In so doing it recom
mended a compromise to the union
| and to the industry.
Industry Said "No"
~rl he union accepted the govern
ment's recommendations," Murray
said, but the industry said no, and it
is the industry's "adamant no" whic'i
is forcing a strike.
'This strike should be recognized
for what it is—a strike on the part
of industry against the government,
against our union and against the
American people.
"A steel strike will benefit no one
on this side of the iron curtain," Fair
less charged.
If it should drag on, he said, it may
"gravely undermine the economic
welfare and the military security of
the whole nation."
"The union is not presently inter
ested in bargaining," he added.
