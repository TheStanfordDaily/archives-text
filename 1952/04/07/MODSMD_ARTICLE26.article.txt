# 'They Went to College'
## 
### 
Time Magazine's survey published last week
under ihe title, "They Went to College," in
many respects paints a surprising picture of
the college graduate, one that could have im
portant repercussions on U.S. highei education.
The accuracy ot the statistics may he de
batable, hut according to advance material,
she book's findings shatter or modify a good
many generally accepted theories about the
college graduate.
One ol the book's shortcomings is that it
measures success largely in terms ol income
earned.
Its statistics lead to the conclusion, tor ex
ample, that the so r ailed "grind," the straight
A student, laies substantially better finan
cially aftei graduation than the student who
participated widely in extra-curricular activi
ties, contrary to most prevailing opinion.
How well his education has equipped "the
grind - ' for life, irrespective of his income- earn
ing powers, the survey makes no attempt to
answer.
Another shortcoming may be the book's
failure to evaluate and analyze some of its find
ings, Advance material makes no analysis of
the book's conclusion that students who support
themselves wholly or in part through college
are in a lower income bracket on the average
ifean those parentally supported.
Explanations might modily the impact of
these statistics. For example, it is probable that
a good deal of the students supported through
college were also partially "supported" alter
ijraduation—to the extent that they were "set
up in business," tided over financially during
less prosperous years, etc. —where the student
who had not received outside help had no
source of pump-priming.
One conclusion of the survey that will dis
may some educators is that the college grad

uate is becoming more and more preoccupied
with the professions and occupations in which
income is likely to be highest. Time Magazine's
review points out that "A generation ago, 60
per cent of the graduates would have said that
they were planning to go into a profession, as
doctors, lawyers, teachers, dentists, clergymen,
or scientists. Only 39 per cent were planning
to go into business. Today less than half the
students plan lor professions, and business has
jumped into first place with 48 per cent."
While the professions, especially the lower
paid professions, are shrinking in popularity,
due in large pait to low financial compensation,
the need lor personnel in these areas grows
constantly.
Most discouraging of all the survey's con
clusions is that college graduates politically
"do little more than vole." Time Magazine
says"The Old Grad seems to exeit com
paratively little diiect influence on public
affairs. Politically he appears passive."
The chances are less than one in ten that a
Republican student will switch parties. Among
Democrats, the chance is twice as great. The
fact that colleges produce a good deal of in
dependent voters (3!i per cent) is encouraging
if the independence is based cn "the broad
view" and suspension of judgment. But il poli
tical independence is contributing to apathy in
public affairs and low political participation, the
fact is disappointing.
Often thought of as a sower of radical seeds,
the college campus, according to the survey,
tends to promote "more conservatism than the
folklore would have you believe."
To the extent that higher education tends
to foster the prima facie acceptance of the
status guo arid stifles the voice of protest, an
essential in a democratic society, college ed
ucation could stand considerable re-evalua
tion.

who had not received outside help had no

One conclusion of the survey that will dis
may some educators is that the college grad

uate is becoming more and more preoccupied
with the professions and occupations in which
income is likely to be highest. Time Magazine's
review points out that "A generation ago, 60
per cent of the graduates would have said that
they were planning to go into a profession, as
doctors, lawyers, teachers, dentists, clergymen,
or scientists. Only 39 per cent were planning
to go into business. Today less than half the
students plan lor professions, and business has
jumped into first place with 48 per cent."
While the professions, especially the lower
paid professions, are shrinking in popularity,
due in large pait to low financial compensation,
the need lor personnel in these areas grows
constantly.
Most discouraging of all the survey's con
clusions is that college graduates politically
"do little more than vole." Time Magazine
says"The Old Grad seems to exeit com
paratively little diiect influence on public
affairs. Politically he appears passive."
The chances are less than one in ten that a
Republican student will switch parties. Among
Democrats, the chance is twice as great. The
fact that colleges produce a good deal of in
dependent voters (3!i per cent) is encouraging
if the independence is based cn "the broad
view" and suspension of judgment. But il poli
tical independence is contributing to apathy in
public affairs and low political participation, the
fact is disappointing.
Often thought of as a sower of radical seeds,
the college campus, according to the survey,
tends to promote "more conservatism than the
folklore would have you believe."
To the extent that higher education tends
to foster the prima facie acceptance of the
status guo arid stifles the voice of protest, an
essential in a democratic society, college ed
ucation could stand considerable re-evalua
tion.
Time Magazine's survey published last week
under ihe title, "They Went to College," in
many respects paints a surprising picture of
the college graduate, one that could have im
portant repercussions on U.S. highei education.

How well his education has equipped "the
