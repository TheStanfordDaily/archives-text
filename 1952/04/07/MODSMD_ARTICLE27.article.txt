occur in real life and the way they happen in the
movies.
Ilere is a scene as it might happen in real life at
Stanford: A western civ instructor, Mr. Jones, is

That's how it happens in real life. Now. if a
movie company came to Stanford, the same scene
might be depicted the following way on the screen:
Mr. Jones, a Western Civ instructor, is working in
hi:-; spacious hk kory-parieled office. A white streak
runs through his immaculately groomed hair, and his
suit has ben made by five tailors (Foremen and
' 'lark). While adjusting his diamond stickpin on his
black turtleneck sweater, two secretaries announce
that Miss Mulkuvy wants to see him.
Miss Mulkuvy hips her way in, and she is a gor
geous blonde, the sight of whom would drop a man
at fifty yards.

Mr. Jones: (suavely) Have a seat Miss Mulkuvy.
Cigarette?
Miss Mulkuvy: (In a sultry voice) Yes, don't mind
if I do.
Mr. Jones: Jeannette ... er ... I mean, Miss
Mulkuvy . . . why do you wish to see me?
Miss Mulkuvy: Well, Reginald ... er ... I
mean, iVIr. Jones, I wanted to find out what I got
on my last midterm.
Mr. Jones: Well, Jeannetle, I can call you Jean
nette, can't I?
Miss Mulkuvy: Yes, Reginald.
Mr. Jones: Jeannette, this has to be said. We must
face these things.
Miss Mulkuvy: Yes, Reginald, yes, yes . . .
Mr. Jones: Well . . .
Miss Mulkuvy: . . . You mean . . .
Mr. Jones: Yes, you Dunked it.
Miss Mulkuvy: How could you?
Mr. Jones: It was not I, Jeannette. Remember, I
am an instructor in Western Civilization. It was my
four readers, Buss, Bark, Vucinich, and Robinson.
(Miss Mulkuvy breaks into sobs, ami Mr. Jones
comforts her).
Miss Mulkuvy (in an cmntion-choked voice):
How could you let your readers. Buss, Bark, Vucin
ich, and Kohinson do this to me? I thought, Mr.
Jones . . . Reginald thst 9 meant something to you.
Mr. Jones: You do, Miss Mulkuvy . . . Jeannette,
but this was unavoidable.
Miss Mulkuvy: You know what this means in our
relationship, Reginald.
Mr. Jones: No, you don't mean that we're through
. . . that our love is as non-existant as an Pithecan
thropus Erectus in the modern age.
Miss Mulkuvy: This is it, Reginald.
Mr. Jones: No, you can't leave me! You can't!!!
Miss Mulkuvy: This is the only way, Reginald.
(She defiantly stomps out and slams the door.
Reginald Jones hastily scribbles out a note, pulls a
revolver from his drawer, and shoots himself in the
temple three times. He slumps over his dedc, and the
curtain drops from exhaustion.)
