## Schedule Kinsey in Frost 
### 
To the Editor:
Regarding Doctor Kinsey's lecture to lie given on
sexual matters Wednesday, April 19, let's be realistic
and schedule it for Frost Amphitheater or Stanford
Stadium. The crowds of cheering thousands who have

been hearing "the good doctor" at clearly indicate
thai iVb in And will not even begin to accommodate the
interested Stanford audience.
