# Overrated 'Zapata' Is Good in Flashes
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
"Viva Zapata!" lias been widely trumpeted by its producers as
the year's first major film and Academy Award contender. But
despite considerable merits and a credit list which glitters with
the names of Darryl F. Zanuck, Elia Kazan, John Steinbeck, and
Marlon Brando, the picture now at the Stanford never quite makes
good on its claims. ♦

To treat with first things first,
there is the matter of Steinbeck's
script, fn it Emiliano Zapata one
of Mexico's celebrated heroes, the
peasant leader who in l'Jll joined
with Madero to break Dictator Por
firio Diaz's 154-year reign—is given
a fairly blatant whitewashing.
Dealing with a figure enveloped
in an even greater fog of legend

Ih a n our own
Abraham Li n -
coin, Steinbeck
has made no ef
fort to separate
fact from myth;
and the result,
while not false,

is a serious case of half-truths and
things left unsaid. True that Za
pata was a champion of the people
and was instrumental in regaining
their farms for them from the great
landowners; but he was also a cruel
person, capable of outrageous in
humanities; and none of this is
brought out in the movie.
Kazan Short of Expectations
Furthermore, Director Kazan
fails in this picture to create the
ever - increasing tension without,
which his characteristic technique
of building slowly to a resounding
climax falls flat. Audiences which
have come to expect the unexpect
ed from him will be disappointed to
note that, given the whole outdoors
to work in, he does little that lesser
directors of ordinary Westerns have
not already done.
But if, as a collection of se
quences, the picture doesn't hold
together, certainly there are indi
vidual scenes that flash brilliance.

! The scene in which Fernando (Jo
seph Wiseman of "Detective Story")
calls for and meets Zapata in the
mountains rings true for anybody
who knows Mexico and the Mexi
cans. Again the wedding night of
Zapata and Josefa (nicely played
by Jean Peters) is a frank, sensi
tive, and beautifully handled se
quence.
'•'Brando Holds Movie Together
Yet it is Marlon Brando who is
responsible for whatever vitality
the film has. The star of "Street
car," surprisingly, has scrapped
most of his Stanley Kowalski traits
j and — abetted by drooping mus
tache, flared nostrils, and drawn
; eyes—goes ahead to develop a new
personality which breathes real life
into the Mexican folk hero.
Helping him to salvage what he
can is Alex North's score. No other
single feature goes so far as this
to achieve a feeling of Mexico in
j the picture. The music is bright,
I clean, compelling, and original.
