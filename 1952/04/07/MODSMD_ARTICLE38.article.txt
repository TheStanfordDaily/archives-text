### LARRY CAHN 
Stanford's ttack squad made it two in a row Saturday as they raced past the Olympic Club of
San FrancjSco, 68-63.
And again this week an unknown surprised. Against San Jose State last Saturday, Bob Magee,
uiili..-raided junior, ran the hundred in 9.7. This week Leo Long cimazed by tossing the javelin 205
ft. \ 1 V2 in.
The 175-lb. sophomore transfer from Modesto J Z, who failed to compete last week because of an

injured elbow, paced the field in
tlii.s event following the withdrawal I
i>l former Stanford star Bud Held. I
Held, who wrenched a shoulder on I
his first throw, throws the spear ■
con.' i>:tcnt!y around the 220 - ft.
mark.
Bab Mr.lhias, who is alternating
events in preparation for the de
cathlon trial}, took third in the jav
c.jiii with a toss of 189 It. 1 in.
Mathias also fared well in his |
other events. He won the high hur- J
dl- in : 14.7 and in the discus Bob j
tossed the plate 160 ft. 7 1 •> in. for ;
another first. After clearing the bar
at 12 11. (I in. in the pole vault,
Matiiia:, dropped out and did not
place. In the high jump Mathias
cleared 5 ft. 11 in. but could not
go hi ■■her.
The Olympic Clubbers might well
have, copped the meet if it had not
been for the injury to Held and the |
slowing down of Gay Bryan, who j
aggravated a sore leg.
Bryan before the broad jump had j
chiil''.'' I up points with a second in j
the bundled, finishing second to |
Card Maury Parson who broke the I
tape at :09.9. Magee, who did so :
well la I week, came up with a sore
heel and loped home third. Coach I
Weier hau er withdrew Bob from
the low hurdles.
Stanford did well in the middle
distances, taking both first and sec
ond places in the 880 and the 440.
In the h:;0 Wally McCumani nosed
out teammate John Woolley by
o ly a few inches. And in the 440
Fred George took it in 49.7 fol
lowed by Bill Friedrichs of Stan
ford.
In the mile and two-mile Stan- ;
ford took two firsts. Bob Simon ran
a good 4:18.0 mile to turn in his
bes-.l mark in three years at Stan
ford. Simon was pressed during the
first three laps by Olympic Club- !
hers Walt Boehm and Bob Stout '
but kicked home to win by 40 yards, j
Unit Reed, only a freshman,
(burned in a remarkable two
mile, being timed at .2 for
the eight laps. Reed completely
outdistanced the lield to win by a
hundred yards over Stout.


BIG EFFORT —Stanford's track team has come up with several
surprise performers this year. Perhaps the biggest surprise of
all has been giant Howard Hertz (above) who has been putting
the shot over 52 feet. Hertz would have broken the world record
twenty years ago, but now Stanford track fans merely hope he
can place in the Nationals. —Photo by Dick Schwarz
