The Olympic Club ruggers I
clinched the Northern California |
Rugby Union championship Satur- I
day afternoon by downing Stanford j
16' to 9.
After the Indians took two early j
leads on a long, difficult penalty I
kick by A 1 Kirkland and a hard- |
driving touchdown run by Ron
Cook, the Winged "O"' began to
roll in the second half.
Superior kicking turned the tide
and eventually proved the decid
ing factor in the gmaP. Continual
long punting and kicks into touch
kept the Stanford backs in a hole
virtually all the second half and
paved the way for two OC touch
downs, one by Dave Brown and the
second in a big pileup on the goal
line.
Hank Borghi, whose toe account
ed for ten of the OC points, added
two conversions to his earlier pen
alty kicks to make up the final
score.
Before the clinching OC TD in
the final minutes of the game, full- j
back Fletch had given the
Indian partisans one last glimmer of
hope with a short penalty kick |
which had narrowed the margin to I
11 to 9.
