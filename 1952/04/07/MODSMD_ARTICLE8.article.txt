### PETE GROTHE 
Ilvorett Dean's baseballers
looked up at the scoreboard,
found themselves 011 the short
end of the 3-0 score, nd then
proceeded to whale the day
lights out of throe Cal pitchers
to win, £1-5, at llie Sunken Dia
mond Saturday.
The win gave Ibe Card:-; a one
won, two lr>:,l ro-urd in CJBA plays.
If one can ignore the fact that
Stanford's Pog Osenhaugli issued
ten walks, he pitched a very good
game. Fourteen of the 27 men
who were out went dawn via (be
strike-out route and curve-ball
ing Hog only allowed four hits.
However, (lie walks almost meant
bis pilehirv; ruination.
Cal pushed aero ■; two runs in the
first inning and one in the second,
mostly on the ; treneth of Oscn
baugh's inability to find the plate.
With the count 3-0 against them,
the Dean men wcnl to work again •(
Ed Mayer, ace "1 the Bear
mound staff, and lagged him for
four runs in the second inning.
The kids from the Farm tacked
two more on the board in the third,
to make it fi-3.
Bern Pitau, the second of three
Cal pitchers, issued walks to third
basemen Ray Swarts and Rosen
krantz. Agar muffled out a single
to right field to send in Rosen
krantz, and Oser.baugh looped a
I rainbow hit over second to score
! Agar.
That was all the runs the Indians
needed to win but just for good
measure solo runs were added in
the fifth and sixth. In the fifth,
freshman Dick Scramaglia, filling in
at second for the injured Art Abra-

hamson, boomed a 370-foot triple 1
into right field to score Agar who
had walked.
In the sixth, Shepard rolled home
while Berkeley second baseman Jim
Crew was occupying himself trying
to put out Hal Skillman, who stole
second.
Goodrich, the smooth fielding
short catcher from La Jolla, went
into the ,*{ame with a .37fl mark

ably with four singles in live trips

—I lis boys looked good
Ilvorett Dean's baseballers
looked up at the scoreboard,
found themselves 011 the short
end of the 3-0 score, nd then
proceeded to whale the day
lights out of throe Cal pitchers
to win, £1-5, at llie Sunken Dia
mond Saturday.
The win gave Ibe Card:-; a one
won, two lr>:,l ro-urd in CJBA plays.
If one can ignore the fact that
Stanford's Pog Osenhaugli issued
ten walks, he pitched a very good
game. Fourteen of the 27 men
who were out went dawn via (be
strike-out route and curve-ball
ing Hog only allowed four hits.
However, (lie walks almost meant
bis pilehirv; ruination.
Cal pushed aero ■; two runs in the
first inning and one in the second,
mostly on the ; treneth of Oscn
baugh's inability to find the plate.
With the count 3-0 against them,
the Dean men wcnl to work again •(
Ed Mayer, ace "1 the Bear
mound staff, and lagged him for
four runs in the second inning.
The kids from the Farm tacked
two more on the board in the third,
to make it fi-3.
Bern Pitau, the second of three
Cal pitchers, issued walks to third
basemen Ray Swarts and Rosen
krantz. Agar muffled out a single
to right field to send in Rosen
krantz, and Oser.baugh looped a
I rainbow hit over second to score
! Agar.
That was all the runs the Indians
needed to win but just for good
measure solo runs were added in
the fifth and sixth. In the fifth,
freshman Dick Scramaglia, filling in
at second for the injured Art Abra-

hamson, boomed a 370-foot triple 1
into right field to score Agar who
had walked.
In the sixth, Shepard rolled home
while Berkeley second baseman Jim
Crew was occupying himself trying
to put out Hal Skillman, who stole
second.
Goodrich, the smooth fielding
short catcher from La Jolla, went
into the ,*{ame with a .37fl mark
