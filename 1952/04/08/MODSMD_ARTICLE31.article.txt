# No Cure-All for Yell Leader
## 
### 
A revised process for nominating head yell
leaders will get under way tonight when men
ir'orofitc-d in running lor the office meet in the
Pavilion for a training session lead by Torn
Randolph.
As a result of a change Excom made last
quaiter in the by-laws of the ASSU Constitu
tion. the prospective candidates will be asked
V) lollow the training session with a perform
ance before an Excom Election Committee.
Made up of ASSU President Wayne Alley,
£AU members Jack bickel and Bob Frojen,
and two Excom members yet to be selected,
tho Committee will then pick six candidates
to run in the general election.
The idea behind the new setup is to insure
n ballotful of capable candidates. Until now,
tho voter rarely had anything more concrete to
base his vote on than flashy posters, funny mid
night serenades, and a few feeble attempts at
demonstrations in poorly-attended campaign
assemblies. The committee is intended to up
the calibre of men who make the ballot, and
though the training session is not required, pre
sumably the candidates who have gone through
it will make a better showing late: on.

The democracy ol the process wa3 ques
tioned when it came up before Excom, but it
was pointed out that tryouts are open and that
if any candidate is overlooked by the com
mittee write-ins are still legal.
This screening j)rocess is a move in the
light direction. but we are afraid it is not a
panacea /or all yell leader ills. The process
may keep the talentless from the ballot, but
there is nothing to insure that a good-sized
number of men will take the trouble to try out
in the first place.
The make-up of the selection committee is
another imperfection. Rally Committee, which
works closely with the Head Yell Leader, is
not represented. Responsibility in the choosing
of yell leaders was taken out of Rally Coin's
hands two years ago because of excessive poli
tics in the committee, but this is not an adequate
reason to do away entirely with their experi
enced judgment.
In any case, the new arrangement will get
its test run this spring and the Student Body
will have a chance to see if Exccm has more
work to do before the yell leader problem is
completely solved. —Dorothy Dodge

and two Excom members yet to be selected,
tho Committee will then pick six candidates
to run in the general election.
The idea behind the new setup is to insure
n ballotful of capable candidates. Until now,
tho voter rarely had anything more concrete to
base his vote on than flashy posters, funny mid
night serenades, and a few feeble attempts at
demonstrations in poorly-attended campaign
assemblies. The committee is intended to up
the calibre of men who make the ballot, and
though the training session is not required, pre
sumably the candidates who have gone through
it will make a better showing late: on.

The democracy ol the process wa3 ques
tioned when it came up before Excom, but it
was pointed out that tryouts are open and that
if any candidate is overlooked by the com
mittee write-ins are still legal.
This screening j)rocess is a move in the
light direction. but we are afraid it is not a
panacea /or all yell leader ills. The process
may keep the talentless from the ballot, but
there is nothing to insure that a good-sized
number of men will take the trouble to try out
in the first place.
The make-up of the selection committee is
another imperfection. Rally Committee, which
works closely with the Head Yell Leader, is
not represented. Responsibility in the choosing
of yell leaders was taken out of Rally Coin's
hands two years ago because of excessive poli
tics in the committee, but this is not an adequate
reason to do away entirely with their experi
enced judgment.
In any case, the new arrangement will get
its test run this spring and the Student Body
will have a chance to see if Exccm has more
work to do before the yell leader problem is
completely solved. —Dorothy Dodge
