### DICK McLEAN 
]{in!e Awakening . . .

Now there's this fellow who lives at the same place
T do. He's not. a bail guy really; he's just a little
strange. Some people think he's crazy whereas others
.ay he's "different." One of his strangest habits is
not going to bed at; night. If there ever was a man
suited for a vocation in life, it is he. He would make
the best night watchman imaginable. He claims
that the night is the only time to work. "It's quiet
and cool and there's nobody to bother you," he ex-
X ;i:iins.

It's not that he has insomnia.
No sir. He just likes to live a t
tilted— prowl by night and sleep
by day—existence. Anil sleep he
does. Once he goes to bed, it is
a major undertaking to rouse him.
When someone shakes him and
tells him it's time to get up, he
Lit: up brightly, says "thank you,"
..•ill goes through the motions of
rolling out and into his slippers. (
But as soon as the wake-up
man turns his back or is out of sight

sneaks back, to bed. He has no conscious recollec
t'on of this and often claims that no one woke him
in time for a class or an important appointment. (A
psychologist would say that he has a split personality
between the sleeping and waking man.)
Ho has been known to sleep through: cold water;
two alarmclocks; lire-crackers thrown under his
bed; being kicked; having his covers pulled ott':
Mid being rolled onto the floor. True, he snorts a
bit and may even utter a few comments but still he
sleeps.
Al 1 this is by way of background so that you can
understand how and what happened up the row last.
Saturday morning.
It appears that this fellow wasn't too quiet when
lie went tu bed in the cold light before dawn, lie was
whittling happily to himself and laughing at the "dull"
people who lived regular lives. Ili.s friends did not

think it quite so funny.
At approximately 9:00 a.m. the vigilantes struck.
Ten of them sneaked onto the sleeping porch and
called his name soltly. No response. They called
louder. Still no response from the heavily breathing
form. Su they put their diabolical plan into action.
Gently they carried him, complete with mattress and
bed cover all in place, down three flights of stairs and
deposited him on the front lawn of the girls' row
house across the street, Even when they had retreated
to their own property to watch the "fun," he was still
peacefully sleeping.
At 9:30 a.m. a Durand girl with a soft voice
rubbed the back of bis neck and asked, "Wouldn't
you like to wake up?" I'm sure the fellow must
have thought be was dreaming because lie just gave
a slight grin with bumming sound attached and
continued his rest.
At. 9:40 a.m. his slumber ended. The majority of
Durand House was standing on the front porch sing
ing, "Good morning to you, good morning to you . . ."
His head popped out of the covers. (He nearly did,
too, but in only a pair of shorts, it would have been
a bit inappropriate.) With a glance lie surveyed the
singing girls, the sea ol grass around him, the con
vulsed laughter of his "friends" on the opposite lawn,
and pretty well figured what had happened.
"Good morning," he said. (What the hell else could
he say?)
The girls were very kind. They brought liiin a
cup of coffee and a cigarette all the while making
book on what he had on and bow be was going to
get back to his own house. The odds stood 9 ot 5
against. But with the coffee to give him plenty of
energy and the cigarette to clear bis mind, he
wrapped one of his blankets around himself in the
manner of a Hawaiian sarong, thanked the girls for
their hospitality, offered to do the same for any of
them, and walked home.
His friends said, "Wo ought to have those girls
over here every morning to get him up."
Said he,"It wasn't so bad. After all I got break
fast in bed and besides, it makes a good story. Maybe
I'll write about it sometime.''
