# CAMPUS OPINION
## A 						Warningâ€”'What Is Mine I Shall Protect' 
### 
To the Editor:
I have a few words to say that will lie of interest
1 i some of your readers. Therefore will you please
print the following message?
TO THC STUDENTS OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY:
My name is Martin Blumberg. I work on campus,
and I live out on Page Mill' Road, approximately
one-half mile above the intersection of Page Mill and
Moody roads. My house is the last in the gioup in
that .section, separated almost one-third of a mile
from the nearest neighbor. It is on the left side of
the road as you are ascending, and may be identified
by a large white gate.
About three or four months ago, someone lifted the
name sign, which hung on the gate. Saturday
nif.hl. someone pried loose our doorbell which had
been bolted into the concrete. I have reason to
suspect that these brave deeds were perpetrated by
Stanford students, bent on trophy hunting, Moreover
the ground was littered with a lot of torn papers,
presumably used to muffle the sound of the bell.
I can assure you that all such acts of petty thievery
are a grevious mistake. No one in his right mind,
who knows my character, will tamper with my prop
erly or intrude upon my privacy. What little worldly
goods I have acquired have not come easily, and
what is mine I shall protect.
Therefore I wish to serve notice to you students on
twj points:
a) If that bell and sign are on campus or its
environs, I will allow you until 5 p.m. of Wednesday
(tomorrow) this week to return them to my desk at
tin Radio Propagation Laboratory. II they are not
returned by the deadline time, but I do locate them
afterwards in anyone's possession, I am going to tear
:;aid persons apart. If they are in a frat house, I will
hold the frat house president equally responsible.

b) Hereafter, any persons parking at night near
my gate do so at their own peril. The isolation, dis
tances and terrain are such that 1 am going to assume
that anyone in the vicinity is there for no good, and
they are going tu get it.
1 am not going to wain you again. Take heed.

To the Editor:
I have a few words to say that will lie of interest
1 i some of your readers. Therefore will you please
print the following message?
TO THC STUDENTS OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY:
My name is Martin Blumberg. I work on campus,
and I live out on Page Mill' Road, approximately
one-half mile above the intersection of Page Mill and
Moody roads. My house is the last in the gioup in
that .section, separated almost one-third of a mile
from the nearest neighbor. It is on the left side of
the road as you are ascending, and may be identified
by a large white gate.
About three or four months ago, someone lifted the
name sign, which hung on the gate. Saturday
nif.hl. someone pried loose our doorbell which had
been bolted into the concrete. I have reason to
suspect that these brave deeds were perpetrated by
Stanford students, bent on trophy hunting, Moreover
the ground was littered with a lot of torn papers,
presumably used to muffle the sound of the bell.
I can assure you that all such acts of petty thievery
are a grevious mistake. No one in his right mind,
who knows my character, will tamper with my prop
erly or intrude upon my privacy. What little worldly
goods I have acquired have not come easily, and
what is mine I shall protect.
Therefore I wish to serve notice to you students on
twj points:
a) If that bell and sign are on campus or its
environs, I will allow you until 5 p.m. of Wednesday
(tomorrow) this week to return them to my desk at
tin Radio Propagation Laboratory. II they are not
returned by the deadline time, but I do locate them
afterwards in anyone's possession, I am going to tear
:;aid persons apart. If they are in a frat house, I will
hold the frat house president equally responsible.

b) Hereafter, any persons parking at night near
my gate do so at their own peril. The isolation, dis
tances and terrain are such that 1 am going to assume
that anyone in the vicinity is there for no good, and
they are going tu get it.
1 am not going to wain you again. Take heed.
