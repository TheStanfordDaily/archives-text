# ON OTHER CAMPUSES
## Prying Cops, Flaming Crosses, Flirty Girls Stir New Trouble

A once-sround-the-country reveals everything from cross-burn
ing to campus police investigations popping up in the recent news
on other college campuses.
GEORGIA TECH—After spending its entire history in stag se
clusion, the "helluva engineer" school is considering admitting

coeds. The administration is favor- <
able, but the general reaction ol I
the student body is against expon
ing itself to the evils ol femininity. I
U. OF BRITISH COLUMBIA
Students in a referendum turned
down a proposal to establish an ex
change scholarship for students
from Russia.
TEXAS TECH A pair of coeds
attempted to sign up for ROTC. The
baffled recruiting officer found that
there was nothing in the Army reg
ulations stipulating the sex of per
sons enrolling in ROTC. One of the
gals threatened to bring down the
wrath of her father, a brigadier
general, if she wasn't admitted. But
just as the harassed lieutenant be
gan to contemplate suicide, they
admitted the whole affair was a
joke.
HARVARD — A five - foot - high
cross was lighted one dark night
outside the rooms of several Negro
students. The incident was kept
pretty quiet and didn't make the
wire headlines. Nevertheless, even
this minor outbreak of the perse
cution usually associated with Ku
Klux Klanism brought down the
just wrath of the Harvard Crimson
and other college dailies which
learned of the incident.
SC — Wampus returned with a
bang in March. The Trojan humor j
mag, shut down last year, set an
all-time sales record with the first j
edition of its new feries. The issue
featured a satire on UCLA, and set
off a hot feud with Scop, the Bruin j
mag, which may boost circulation J
and interest on both campuses for i
some time to come.
CORNELL — A harried headline
writer on the Cornell Daily Sun got
off an odd one by titling the local
grad school of business "BUSY
SCHOOOL."
WISCONSIN — After numerous
complaints had been received from
students and several petitions cir
culated, a student - faculty joint
committee was set up to investigate
the campus police department. The
police were charged with illegal de
tention, unwarranted search, and
treating the students like hardened
criminals, among other things.
DARTMOUTH — While charity
drives are lagging all over the coun- j
try, Dartmouth has set a new all- I
time record of over $10,000 in its
Campus Chest drive. The total, over
$1,000 higher than in any previous
year, really represented an effort
on the part of the student body,
numbering about 3,000 men.

HARVARD — A five - foot - high
cross was lighted one dark night
outside the rooms of several Negro
students. The incident was kept
pretty quiet and didn't make the
wire headlines. Nevertheless, even
this minor outbreak of the perse
cution usually associated with Ku

just wrath of the Harvard Crimson
and other college dailies which
learned of the incident.
SC — Wampus returned with a
bang in March. The Trojan humor j
mag, shut down last year, set an
all-time sales record with the first j

mag, which may boost circulation J
and interest on both campuses for i
some time to come.

try, Dartmouth has set a new all- I
time record of over $10,000 in its

year, really represented an effort
on the part of the student body,
numbering about 3,000 men.
