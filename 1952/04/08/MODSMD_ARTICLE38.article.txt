# 'Wierd' Rule Irks UCLA
## 
### 
A weird decision by the Student
Judicial Board at UCLA has per
mitted a very confused student ac
tivity situation to arise on the Bruin
campus.
The board decided that "Any
ASUCLA-repognized student activ
ity may investigate any other ASU
CLA activity or office," as reported
in the Daily Bruin.
The controversy arose when one
student committee, Organizations
Control Board, contested the right
ol another, the National Students'
Association (from which Stanford
dropped in 1950), to investigate
student activity.
Refering to the ASUCLA con ti
tution and by-laws, the Judicial
Board ruled that no extensive pow
ers are stated or implied.
Without elaborating or speculat
ing on the crossfires that may un
doubtedly occur under the ruling,
the SJB chairman declared that the
decision paves the way for any rec
ognized activity to make investiga
tions it deems necessary.
