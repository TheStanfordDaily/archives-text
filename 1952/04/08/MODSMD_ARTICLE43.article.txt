# Card New Harvard Track Coach
## 
### 
William McCurdy, captain of the
1937 Stanford track team, has been
appointed head track coach at Har
vard University. He replaces Jaak
ko Nikkola, who retired after 31
years at the Ivy League stronghold.
Having already served as frosh
roach an J Nikkola's assistant, Mc-
Curdy fits right into the head spot.
He is the fourth Indian who ran
under famed Dink Templeton to
become head coach at a major uni
versity. This is somewhat of a rec
ord for a single mentor.
Other coaches are Flint Hanner, 1
Fresno State; Stan Hi.serman, Uni
versity of Idaho; and Stanford's
own Jack Weiershauser. Hiserman
arnl Weiershauser were teammates
of McCurdy's on the record-break
ing relay squads of '37.
In his competitive days, McCurdy
ran the 440 and 880. His best event
was the half-mile, and he ran the
two laps in less than 1:55. He won
the Big Meet half-mile in 1:55.5
and was on the winning mile relay.
Against the terrible Trojans, he won
the half, was second in the 440.
Born in Bolinas in Mill Valley,
McCurdy attended Tamalpais High
School before coming to Stanford.
During the last war, he broke the
IJ.S. Army's physical fitness tests,
which are something like an all
sport decathlon requiring running,
throwing, and swimming.
According to Coach Weiershau
ser, McCurdy, an unusually large
man for a middle-distance runner,
was an outstanding competitor. He
always kept fit and was strong on
training.
"He had guts and courage, and
beat, plenty of men he fhouldn't
have. He had fight, real fight, and
he loved to run," reminisced Stan
ior.i's coach.
