## A 						Sporting Chance Joe Chez' Stanford Spirit 
### 
This morning we'd like to "take five" from the daily grind and dofT the
columnar hat to one of Stanford's top hiders, Joe Chez.
Joe, whose recent record shows a lot of evidence for claiming the time
worn but heartbreakingly true title of hard-luck champ, first hit the campus
headlines as a sophomoie in 1950.
Unheralded, he pitched and won the opening CIBA game against UCLA
and went on to compile a 7 and 0 league record and win the most valuable
player award.
Last year, a brutal attack of pneumonia hit him before the season started,
and he didn't ever come up to the tremendous things expected of him of
his first year's record. Still, he went like a house afire in summer league
ball.
Anticipating a comeback this year, Joe was just rounding into shape
when he was sidelined by a tricky cracked knuckle. The fracture kept
him from any throwing for a while, and then no curves for a greater while.
The finger has healed now, though, and Joe is back in action. This week,
he's slated to go five against San Diego today and maybe start one of the
SC games this weekend.
But all this is open history. What we'd really like to talk about is a
grand job of off-season public relations Joe has done for Stanford the past
couple of years by handling the kids rooting section at football games.
Handed the job by the student police two years ago, Joe hit on the idea
of leading yells to keep energetic youngsters in their seats; it paid off.
Gradually he expanded the idea, occasionally adding a pom-pom girl
or some other gimmick, until last fall he went to the trouble of printing
up cards for an "Honorary Stanford Police" organization and distributing
them to regular comers who didn't get into any trouble.
At the end of the season he really had the kids yelling for the Indians
and the athletic police pleased at the improved situation in kids section,
once "headache corner" of the Stadium. In addition is the intangible affec
tion the yongsters' parents have undoubtedly gained for Stanford as a
result of the attention and care given their children.
So for Joe we like to give a well done in the true "Stanford Spirit," and
a good luck on a really successful season on the mound.

Gradually he expanded the idea, occasionally adding a pom-pom girl
or some other gimmick, until last fall he went to the trouble of printing
up cards for an "Honorary Stanford Police" organization and distributing
them to regular comers who didn't get into any trouble.
At the end of the season he really had the kids yelling for the Indians
and the athletic police pleased at the improved situation in kids section,
once "headache corner" of the Stadium. In addition is the intangible affec
tion the yongsters' parents have undoubtedly gained for Stanford as a
result of the attention and care given their children.
So for Joe we like to give a well done in the true "Stanford Spirit," and
a good luck on a really successful season on the mound.

how overconfident can a guy get? . . . the Daily Cavalier at Virginia
editorializing against required PE; man, they must be real joe athletes
back there.
This morning we'd like to "take five" from the daily grind and dofT the
columnar hat to one of Stanford's top hiders, Joe Chez.
Joe, whose recent record shows a lot of evidence for claiming the time
worn but heartbreakingly true title of hard-luck champ, first hit the campus
headlines as a sophomoie in 1950.
Unheralded, he pitched and won the opening CIBA game against UCLA
and went on to compile a 7 and 0 league record and win the most valuable
player award.
Last year, a brutal attack of pneumonia hit him before the season started,
and he didn't ever come up to the tremendous things expected of him of
his first year's record. Still, he went like a house afire in summer league
ball.
Anticipating a comeback this year, Joe was just rounding into shape
when he was sidelined by a tricky cracked knuckle. The fracture kept
him from any throwing for a while, and then no curves for a greater while.
The finger has healed now, though, and Joe is back in action. This week,
he's slated to go five against San Diego today and maybe start one of the
SC games this weekend.
But all this is open history. What we'd really like to talk about is a
grand job of off-season public relations Joe has done for Stanford the past
couple of years by handling the kids rooting section at football games.
Handed the job by the student police two years ago, Joe hit on the idea
of leading yells to keep energetic youngsters in their seats; it paid off.
Gradually he expanded the idea, occasionally adding a pom-pom girl
or some other gimmick, until last fall he went to the trouble of printing
up cards for an "Honorary Stanford Police" organization and distributing
them to regular comers who didn't get into any trouble.
At the end of the season he really had the kids yelling for the Indians
