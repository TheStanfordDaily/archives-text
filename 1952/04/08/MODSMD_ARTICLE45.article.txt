Injuries, u "bouncing baton." and 1
Sacramento JC teamed up against
the Stanford Brave* to hand them
a second in last Saturday's three
way meet with Sacramento and San
Mateo JC. Sacramento took first
with 70 r 2 points, Stanford had (55.;
and San Mateo trailed with 13Vi. j
The Braves led all the way, only
to suffer a setback at the hands of i
fate in the last two events. Keith
i Brownsberger was flowed down in
the sprints by a bad ankle and wa?
held to a third in the 220. Jim Mc-
Indoe, number one JV polevaultar
and high hurdler, injured his
j -shoulder on his first vault, which
j eliminated him from the high hur
les and held him to a tie for fourth
i in the pole vault. Sacramento took

j the first throe places in each of
j these events.
Standout performances were put
forth by Stanford's A! Mendel and
Martin Johnson, each of whom took
two firsts. Mendel took the 100 and
200 in : 10.4 and:23.2 respectively,
while John on took the hiyh jump
j at 6 feet and the 440 in :50.4.
Ed Grilling came thruogh with a
, first in the two-ruile in 10:00.7. La-
Fore t Phillips took a first in the 880
in 2:03.5, and Leon Reynaud took
a fhvt in the discus to give Stanford
seven first places to Sacramento's
six and the relay.
Sacramento practically won the
relay by default, as Stanford drop
j ped the baton and gave them a 30-
yard head start on the first leg. The
Braves almost caught them at the
wire, thanks to a brilliant fourth
I lap by Johnson.
