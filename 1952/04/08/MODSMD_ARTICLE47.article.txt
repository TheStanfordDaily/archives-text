# JV Baseballers Bow, 11-9
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
Although they outhit their arch
rivals the Cal Cinnamon Bears, the
Braves went down to their fifth de
feat of the season Saturday morn
ing, as they dropped an 11 to 9 con
test played on the Sunken Dia
omnd.
The Braves collected 16 hits to
the Bears' 9, but eight walks and
five errors proved to be their ulti
mate undoing.
The Bear Jayvees grabbed an
early three-run bulge in the first
two innings off southpaw Ray High
smith, but this margin was wiped
out in the bottom of the third when
light fielder Terry Evans hit a long
triple with two runners on and then
rode home on Pete Reynolds'
double. After Ron Boyer was tag
ged for two runs in the top of the
fifth, the Braves rallied again in
the home half of the same canto to
push over two tallies and create a
5-5 deadlock. But in the top of the
sixth the roof fell in on the junior
Indians.
Before lefty Stan Fetterman
could get the side out, four Cal
runs had crossed the plate, with the
aid of but two bloop singles.
The Braves made one last try in
the bottom of the eighth when, five
runs behind, singles by Dick Irving,
Len Swartz, and Ralph Cassady pre
ceded another booming extra-base
blow by Evans, and the Braves
were within two runs of tying, but
they could not push any more
scores home.

Rotund Paul Weeks staggered the
entire distance to be the winner,
while Ron Boyer took the defeat.
Four Brave stickers collected
three safeties apiece in the- three
hour affair, Terry Evans blasted a
single, a double, and a triple while
batting in five runs. Left fielder
Pete Reynolds blasted out two sin
gles and a double, while Dick Ir
ving and Ralph Cassady collected
three singles apiece.
The Braves were scheduled to
meet Sequoia High yesterday af
ternoon, but the contest had to be
postponed because of wet grounds.
On Thursday, the Braves tangle
with the Commerce High nine.
