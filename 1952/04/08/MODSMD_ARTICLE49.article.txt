# Helpful Sponsors Unscramble Puzzling Stanford Labyrinth
## 
### BARBARA TUERK 
Jane Freshman arrives at
school. Her bags are heavy, her
feet sore. Roble or Branner as
sumes the proportions of the
Mammoth Caves, and she's
quite sure she'll never find her
own room, let alone any of the
20 pre-reg meetings.
So far, Jane has never given up j
ami retreated home. For just when
things seem blackest, she finds that
she is not alone in this labyrinth—
she has a SPONSOR! A sponsor to
help with her bags, find her room, j
explain pre-reg, listen to her prob
lems, supply her with a reg-dance j
blind date.
Demerits and Dates
Throughout the quarter Jane and
her 20 corridor-mates will continue
knocking at their sponsor's door,
possibly because they can't under
stand the demerit system or how
to try out for Gaieties, or because
they need advice about the F in
geology or the man who got away,
but most probably because their
| sponsor is a good friend, a tennis
or bridge-partner or someone to go
to the movies with.
Next week the AWS Sponsor
Choosing Committee will start re
ceiving applications from girls who
want to be next year's sponsors.
They are looking for almost 40 jun
ior and senior sponsors, for both
freshman halls, for off-campus and
summer quarter freshmen, and for |
sophomore and junior transfers.

Qualifications? The committee
I finally admitted that "We're just
I looking for the kind of girl you'd
I want for your own sponsor. Not
j necessarily an activities girl, it's
more important thai she gel along
i well with others, and he a thinking
j person with ideas of service."

The sponsor system was initiated
j to help incoming freshmen and
I transfer students adjust to the resi
j dence system, to each other, and to
life at Stanford in as short a time
I as possible. The sponsor - training
program stresses the importance of
intangibles, of setting an example
i of self-sufficiency, good citizenship,
and personal integrity that will aid
the incoming students in their per
sonal development.
Because Stanford is a residence
campus, the sponsor program here
is built around the living groups.
The sponsor is a member of the
residence staff within the dormi
tory, and works closely with the
director and assistant director.
Her dual role, as student and staff
member, endows her with triple re
sponsibilities— to her corridor, to
student government, and to the
University administration.
Training Program
Last year, because the sponsors
realized that there was too much
to learn in the few short days be
fore the freshmen arrive in the
fall, a spring training program was
started.
Sponsors are expected to spend
one weekend this spring at an in
formal oil - campus conference, at
which they will receive general
preparation for the fall orientation.
It's an "acquaintance" weekend,
acquainting the sponsors with each
other, with an over-all view of the
campus and student activities, and
with the sponsor program from fac
ulty and administration viewpoints.
There will be talks by residence
heads, by faculty advisers (to help
integrate sponsoring and advising),
and by administration members,
and informal discussions by the
sponsors themselves.
Applications Taken
Girls who are interested in the
sponsor program for next year will

be able to fill out application blanks
in the ASSU office next week, and
to make appointments for inter
views the end o£ this month.

The sponsor system was initiated
j to help incoming freshmen and
I transfer students adjust to the resi
j dence system, to each other, and to
life at Stanford in as short a time
I as possible. The sponsor - training
program stresses the importance of
intangibles, of setting an example
i of self-sufficiency, good citizenship,
and personal integrity that will aid
the incoming students in their per
sonal development.
Because Stanford is a residence
campus, the sponsor program here
is built around the living groups.
The sponsor is a member of the
residence staff within the dormi
tory, and works closely with the
director and assistant director.
Her dual role, as student and staff
member, endows her with triple re
sponsibilities— to her corridor, to
student government, and to the
University administration.
Training Program
Last year, because the sponsors
realized that there was too much
to learn in the few short days be
fore the freshmen arrive in the
fall, a spring training program was
started.
Sponsors are expected to spend
one weekend this spring at an in
formal oil - campus conference, at
which they will receive general
preparation for the fall orientation.
It's an "acquaintance" weekend,
acquainting the sponsors with each
other, with an over-all view of the
campus and student activities, and
with the sponsor program from fac
ulty and administration viewpoints.
There will be talks by residence
heads, by faculty advisers (to help
integrate sponsoring and advising),
and by administration members,
and informal discussions by the
sponsors themselves.
Applications Taken
Girls who are interested in the
sponsor program for next year will

be able to fill out application blanks
in the ASSU office next week, and
to make appointments for inter
views the end o£ this month.
