# Pres. Truman Seizes Steel Industry to Avert Strike
## Negotiations 'Collapse' In Last-Minute Effort 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 8 (UP) —The government headed off a
steel strike 90 minutes before the midnight deadline tonight by
seizing the industry.
President Truman oidered the seizure in a dramatic test of his
constitutional powers, and CIO President Philip Murray imme-

diately ordered the steel
to stay on the job.
Before his announcement in
dustry had begun preparing to
shut down as workers left their
jobs and nicketed plants hours
before the scheduled midnight
strike.
Blast and open hearth furnaces j
of the major steel companies were |
cooled and banked by (5 p.m.
The President's announcement
came after negotiations collapsed
in New York despite a last-min
ute attempt by Chairman Nathan
P: Feinsinger of the Wage Sta
bilization Board to get the par
ties to agree on a modified wage
proposal.
Mr. Truman ordered Secretary of
Commerce Charles W. Sawyer to
assume control of the industry to '
head oil what he termed a "grave
danger" to national security which
even increased the risk of war.
"As the President of the United
States it is my plain duty to keep
thig from happening," he said. "And j
that is the reason for the measures
taken tonight."
The President said he ordered
seizure instead of invoking the
Taft - Hartley Law because the
emergency requires immediate ac- \
tirin. lie pointed out that the
Taft-Hartley Act requires crea
tion of a fact-finding board lo in
vestigate a labor dispute and re
port to the President.
"We would have to sit around a j
week or two for this board to re- !
port before we could take the next i
step.'' he said. "And meanwhile the
plants would be shut down."
In addition, lie pointed out that |
the' steel union already has post
poned its threatened strike four !
times for a total of 89 days, 19 days
longer than it could be compelled
to do under the 80-day injunctive
provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act.
The K(» companies affected by
tin- action had no immediate com
ment but industry leaders were
preparing to fight the move iu
the Courts*—probably by appeal
ing here tomorrow for an injunc
tion that would block the seizure.
Acting Mobilization Director John
R. Steelman invited representatives :
of the Big Six steel companic ; and
Murray to meet with him in Wash

112
ton at 3 p.m. EST tomorrow in
a renewed effort to hammer out a
contract that would end govern
ment operation of the mills.
The President's action was cer
tain to touch off a red hot contro-
I versy in Congress, where several
! members questioned whether Mr.
! Truman actually had the "inherent"
| powers he used to seize the indus
i try.
