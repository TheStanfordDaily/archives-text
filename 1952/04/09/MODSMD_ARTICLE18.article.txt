# MODEL UN CONFERENCE IN SOUTH
## Stanford's U.S. Delegation Vies With USC's Russians 
### 
They're folding up Iho flays
of 60 foreign nations nt Iho IJm
versify of Southern California
now. And Stanford's eight sin
dents who, in the role of a U.S.
delegation, attended Ihn Model
UN Conference held there last
week, are homo again no long
er thumping tables Jilce a UN
diplomat, but going to lectures
like any other Farm student.
On the way south last Wednesday,
an auto accident sent three of Stan
ford's members home before they
even reached the conference.
Ted Collier, who with George Vel
liotes served as co-chaii man tsf Stan
ford's delegation, reported that the
accident, left them "pretty short
handed," but the rc;t of the delega
tion "came through."
Delegates
The "rest." of the delegation were:
Joel Johnson, Beverlv Kennedy,
Paula Fern, Winifred Wylie, Claude
Dimitropoulos, Wilma Plunkett, and
Cam Strong.
Playing the part of the United
States, Stanford naturally had a large
role in the conference. Their main
opposition was the USSR delegation
played by stduents of the host
school, use.

In an attempt to be thorough in
| their imitation of Russian techniques,
| the USC students even organized
I their own secret "Russian" police.
Hearing that the U.S. delegation
was short-handed, they sent a mem
ber of their secret police to them,
supposedly to "help" them out. lie
j proceeded, of course, to spy on them
I instead.
Spy Foiled
The U.S. delegation, however, saw
through hi tactics and proceeded to
j feed him false information. "We
| used him during the entire confer -
j ence," Ted Collier chuckled.
With a more serious look at the
j conference, Collier had this to say:
j "USC did a magnificent job. We
j were very impressed with their over
j all hospitality and capability in
handling the conference."
Benjamin Cohen, assistant secre-
I taiy-general of the UN acted as con-
J fcrcnce moderator. Last year, the
confercncc was held here at Stan
| ford, when Ralph Bunche conducted
the proceedings.
The conference was more spec
tacular and more extravagantly pub
licized than last year's. Twelve-
I hundred delegates returning to 73
colleges throughout the west re
! ported that they were constantly
followed by spot-lights, newsmen,
I and television cameras.

like any other Farm student.
On the way south last Wednesday,
an auto accident sent three of Stan
ford's members home before they
even reached the conference.
Ted Collier, who with George Vel
liotes served as co-chaii man tsf Stan
ford's delegation, reported that the
accident, left them "pretty short
handed," but the rc;t of the delega
tion "came through."
Delegates
The "rest." of the delegation were:
Joel Johnson, Beverlv Kennedy,
Paula Fern, Winifred Wylie, Claude
Dimitropoulos, Wilma Plunkett, and
Cam Strong.
Playing the part of the United
States, Stanford naturally had a large
role in the conference. Their main
opposition was the USSR delegation
played by stduents of the host
school, use.

In an attempt to be thorough in
| their imitation of Russian techniques,
| the USC students even organized
I their own secret "Russian" police.
Hearing that the U.S. delegation
was short-handed, they sent a mem
ber of their secret police to them,
supposedly to "help" them out. lie
j proceeded, of course, to spy on them
I instead.
Spy Foiled
The U.S. delegation, however, saw
through hi tactics and proceeded to
j feed him false information. "We
| used him during the entire confer -
j ence," Ted Collier chuckled.
With a more serious look at the
j conference, Collier had this to say:
j "USC did a magnificent job. We
j were very impressed with their over
j all hospitality and capability in
handling the conference."
Benjamin Cohen, assistant secre-
I taiy-general of the UN acted as con-
J fcrcnce moderator. Last year, the
confercncc was held here at Stan
| ford, when Ralph Bunche conducted
the proceedings.
The conference was more spec
tacular and more extravagantly pub
licized than last year's. Twelve-
I hundred delegates returning to 73
colleges throughout the west re
! ported that they were constantly
followed by spot-lights, newsmen,
I and television cameras.
