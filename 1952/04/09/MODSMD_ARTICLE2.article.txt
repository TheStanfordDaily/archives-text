# Peace Talks Near The Home Stretch
## 
### 
TOKYO, Wednesday, April 9 â€”
! High-ranking Allied and Commu
nist sub-delegates resumed debate
on truce supervision deadlocks to
day while hopes continued outside
the Panmunjom bargaining tent
that the talks at long last might be
in the home stretch.
The negotiating teams, apparently
marking time while awaiting a de
j cision on recessed prisoner of war
discussions, adjourned after only
eight minutes.- They agreed to meet
: again at 11 a.m. tomorrow (6 p.m.
Wednesday PST).
United Nations sub-delegates had
j hoped the session would develop the
| "hints and insinuations" of enemy
I negotiators that compromise could
1 be reached.
The meeting marked completion
| of nine months of armistice nego
tiations in Korea. It began amidst
optimism nurtured by a Red hint
that stalemates over members of a
i truce policing team and airfield
I construction might be resolved
through a "package" deal.
Strong indications prevail that
both sides have new ideas for end
ing both the prisoner exchange and
truce supervision controversies.
