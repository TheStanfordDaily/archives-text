Dr. Kinsey is the author of the
widely discussed textbook "Sexual
Behavior of the Human Male." He
is being brought to Stanford under
the auspices of the Stanford School
of Medicine.
Today's lecture will be the same
as the one he gave at the Univer
sity of California Friday. Technical
in nature, the address is intended
primarily for students in medicine
and psychology.
Dr. Kinsey is director of the In
stitute of Sex Research at Indiana
University. Since 1938 he has led
the study on human sex behavior
which has been sponsored jointly
by the National Research Council
and the Rockefeller Foundation.
The scientist is now at work on a
second sex study, "Sexual Behav
ior in the Human Female." Ex
plaining his work in an interview
at Cal, he said, "While man is unique
in the mammal world, a study of
man's sex behavior cannot be en
tirely separated from a study of
sex habits in other animals."
Kinsey has already made studies
at more than 150 universities and

colleges, among them the Uruvei
sity of California. In selecting
groups to work with there, he chose
ona fraternity, one sorority, three
co-ops, one class, one graduate
group, one church group, one group
of middle-aged people, and a few
faculty members.
Before beginning hi? studies on
human sex behavior, Dr. Kinsey's
principal field of interest was en
tomology, particularly research on
the gall wasp and the boll weevil.
He has also made significant con
tributions to the study of plant life
and the origin of species.
