# On Selecting Student Managers
## 
### 
It seems to us that the traditional method oI
choosing the student manager could be better
). utdled and put on a more democratic basis.
There was not this year, nor has there been
in the past any sort ol public announcement or
notification as to when applications lor the job
would be acceptable, or when the deadline end
ing applications would be. And no change is
he my co ntempi a ted.
A 1 Masters, director of athletics and general
rr,anager of ihe ASSU, makes the choice for this
post, which is without a doubt one ol the uni
versity's most important.
Masters no doubt is competent to pass judg
ment on the abilities of the applicants. In
making the selection, he consults the advice
of Miss A ten of the ASSU of lice, who is in
a position to be more familiar than anyone
with the applicants and their abilities.
We have no quarrel with this basic procedure.
/.')<! we would consider it unwise to alter the
process and, for example put sludent manager
candidates on the ballot at ASSU elections. The
qualifications for the position are of such a
nature that the expression of the students
through the ballot box, could easily result in
a popularity contest, and election ol less com
petent candidates.
We know of at least one qualified student
who would have made application this year for
iho job had he known when to do so. lie failed
to apply, and the first notification that the selec
tion was in the process of being made, came
when he read in this paper that next year's post
had been filled.
We aie not disputing the choice. Nor are
we hinting at any kind of rigging or railroad
ing or under-handed politics in the selection.
But the democratic procedure would be to
announce application dates to guard against
the disqualification of candidates through
failure to apply.
Mr. Master's explanation is that advertising
thi? fact would bring in a lot of applications from
students with no possibility of being chosenâ€”
ciudents unqualified because of lack of experi
ence, etc.
He cays that those who are qualified and in
terested should be and usually are alert enough
to know the time of selection.

This argument has merit, hut by the same
token, no candidate who is cjuahlied to apply,
who has experience, should be shut out be
cause he doesn't know the application dead
line. And there is no reason why the quali
fications, insofar as they can be defined, be
included along with the announcement, so as
to preclude a iush of unqualified applicants.
The student manager lor summer quarter has
not as yet been chosen. Whether applications
are being accepted and if so how long they will
continue to be accepted has not been an
nounced.
We hope Mr. Masters will make this an
nouncement.
