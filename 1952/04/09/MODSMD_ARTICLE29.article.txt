# Deadlines Approach
## 
### 
Two important deadlines are rapidly ap
proaching: registration for California voters,
and parental pei mission slips for students under
21 who wish to give blood in the coming drive
April 22 and 23.
Voting registration ends tomorrow. For those
whose legal residence is in Santa Clara County,
the task is easy. Registration booths are staffed
daily in the Halo Alto Times Building
For California residents outside this county, a
telegram request lor an absentee registration
blank will be honored if received by the regis
trar of voters in the county on or before the
April ID deadline.
Registration will allow students who meet
the other qualifications (including California
residenceâ€”a university living group is not con
sidered legal residence) to vole in the Cali
fornia primary June 3 and the general election
Nov. 3. Students who are not 21 now, but will
reach this age before Nov. 3 are eligible to
register.
Only once every four years does the elec
torate vote on a president. Strong feelings be
tween election years aren't sufficient to make
a change.

Parental permission slips for those under 21
who wish to donate blood must be secured be
fore April 21, last day for donors to make ap
pointments. While it may be difficult to get
excited about a drive which is almost two weeks
away, the time for the permit slips is now.
