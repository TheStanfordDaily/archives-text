# BULL SESSION
## ON LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
### PETE GROTHE 
John Hall, Ball Sessioner emeritus, and probably
the most talented writer the Daily ever produced,
ciue Bogarted, "Whenever you want j j ,ood Bull Ses
sion material, read the letters to the editor."
'• c>.nipus Opinion had been rather dull ever since
some girls wrote in suggesting that everyone on
campus wear lur coats to class. But yesterday it was
stirred from its lethargy by two vitriolic blasts.
First, Marvin O. Adams, undisputedly the world's
i:»<ist prolific ld(er-to-the-editor writer, stomps in
the Daily.

' Look," cries Marvin 0., "I
have discovered something of
world-shaking importance! The
Commonweal ill Club of San
Francisco is quoted in your
Daily as favoring scrapping the
cross-filing system! Gad, what
an error! Do you know what
this means!? Do you know
what this means!?"
112 didn't know what it meant
"Do you know what thij
ncansr!?" Marvin O. repeated.

Marvin O. sat down, scribbled out his letter to the
tciitoi and stomped out, still muttering something
' Do you know what this means!?"
Then a large man of about 35 summers storms in.
This man is obviously mad. And his name is Martin
Blumburg.
In case you haven't read his letter, pick up an
i.i ue of yesterday's Daily and read the material under

the heading that sounds like its straight, from a Class
B movie: A WARNING—WHAT IS MINE I SHALL
PROTECT.
Parenthetically, a letter came in to the editor yes
terday in response to Blumberg:
Dear Mr. Blumberg,
I will meet you with drawn pistol in front of your
old Larii at twelve o'clock tonight. Prepare to meet,
your maker . . .
John Bartlon
Encina Hall
But back to our point. Blumberg storms in the
Shack in a white rage. It seems that gentlemen are
going around Mr. Blumberg's house and liking il so
much that they arc taking souvenirs as remembrance
of the occasion. And Mr. Blumberg is not too happy
about this.
Mr. Blumberg is convinced that these souvenir
hunters are Stanford students, and one can read in
between the lines in his letter that he wishes, pretty
please, that the souvenirs be returned. He hints this
by saying, ' If they are not returned by deadline time,
but 1 do locate them afterwards in anyone's posses
sion, 1 am going to tear said persons apart."
Mr. Blumberg has been rumored hanging around
several ol the fraternity houses, Lut as yet he has
not caught (he culprits. Or at least 1 have not noticed
any torn-apart persons on quad lately.
This is Lent, and we are all asked to sacrifice some
thing. II some can sacrifice cigarettes and sweets,
why can't others sacrifice doorbells and nameplates,
And let us have none of this nasty talk about tearing
persons apart, eh Mr. Blumberg?
