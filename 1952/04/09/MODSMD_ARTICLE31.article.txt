## Plea for Return of Bare Feet 
### 
To the Editor:
We read with horror in Monday's Daily than on
Oi l Clothes Day of Back to the Farm Week all farm
attire will be suitable except bare feel. Since the
celebration is being postponed a week, perhaps there
is time to get this edict repealed.
Who made it? The Health Service? Ridiculous!
It is a well known fact that athlete's foot does not
infect dry, healthy feet. (And what feet are drier
:• -u healthier than ones without shoes?) Perhaps the
powers th.it be are worried about the nasual appear
ance of unshod students. We would point out that
jeans and flippy straw hats (which are permitted)
are inlinitely woise for Stanford's public relations.
There are quite a few students like us around this

school—people who look forward to the one day of
the year when they can feel the warm cement of the
quad underfoot. Please, someone who has authority,
do something!

(Editor's Note: Unfortunately for these bare foot
lovers of warm cement, a Cardinals poll last year
showed tin-in to lie in the minority. Cardinals cut
bare toot day from its Bark to the Farm Week
schedule after its study showed that most of the
students were not in favor cf it).
