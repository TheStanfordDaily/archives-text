# Film Society's Ads Termed 'Too Arty'
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
Salvador Dali, he of the melt
i ixicj telephones, was pleased
some quarter of a century ago
to strap a couple of dead nags
I across a grand piano.
This thoroughly incongruous
("surrealistic") piece of furniture
was subsequently hauled before a
movie camera and emerged as a
typical scene in a film entitled "The
Anualucian Dog," which, it is said,
plunged right into the heart of in
tellectualized Paris with all tin
weight of an Iberian dagger.
Perhaps it did. Not having been
intelleetualized nor in Paris at the
| time, we cannot affirm nor dispute,
i The point is that the Peninsula
Film Society, which exhibited the
"Andalucian Dog" in its series last
summer, is back again—great news
for those who like their art spelled
with a capital "A." The society,
now known as Kinesis (rhymes
with Master's thesis), through its
recent wedding with lour similar
| groups, opens a five - program se
ries tomorrow evening at 8:15 in
I the Palo Alto High School theater.
Whether the theater he full or
empty, the unfortunate fact stands
| that a great many people inter-
I ested in the cinema as an artistic
I form have already been discour
aged from attending the series.
Ami the blame for this falls
squarely on the Kinesis advertis
| ing circular.
While attractive to fome individ
uals, this circular is nevertheless an
exquisite cameo of pseudo-intellec
tual snob appeal. It is practically
a catalogue of arty double - talk,
containing such phrases as "aware
ness ol the essential situation,"
"caught in the midst of life," "em
body the quality," "integrated work
of shattering force," "man's relation
to necessity," etc.
At one point it stales that
| "there is a new generation of film
j makers who have no intention of
subjecting their work to commer
cial meaninglessne.s.s." This di

rectly implies that such items as
"Death of a Salesman," "Detec
tive Story," "Ace in the Hole," "A
Place in the Sun," "Streetcar,"
etc., are—because financially suc
cessful—meaningless.
Kinesis, of course, is free to print
what it wishes. Yet it would seem
that the organization is failing in
its purpose, which should be to in
troduce more people tu the worthi
ness ol the avant-garde film, and
is instead aiming its appeal strictly
at the arty set.
What we would like to empha
size is that, despite the adver
tising circular, many of the Ki
nesis films will he rc-ally worth
seeing. The art film plays a de
cided and important role in the
cinematic world, and anyone in
terested in movies will do well to
follow the progress of the experi
mentalists.
Dead horses and pianos, when
not passed off as symbolizing "the
strident urgency of the Now," can
be, after all, very amusing—and be
yond such tongue-in-cheek diver
sions, the experimental movie mak-
I ers are responsible for other films
I of great interest, depth, and insight.
They deserve a following.
Tickets can be purchased at the
Skyline, 444 Cowper in Palo Alto.
The price for the series, which runs
on alternate Thursdays through
June 5, is $4.50, and single admis
sion is $1.10.

now known as Kinesis (rhymes
with Master's thesis), through its
recent wedding with lour similar

ries tomorrow evening at 8:15 in
I the Palo Alto High School theater.
Whether the theater he full or
empty, the unfortunate fact stands
| that a great many people inter-
I ested in the cinema as an artistic
I form have already been discour
aged from attending the series.
Ami the blame for this falls
squarely on the Kinesis advertis
| ing circular.
While attractive to fome individ
uals, this circular is nevertheless an
exquisite cameo of pseudo-intellec
tual snob appeal. It is practically
a catalogue of arty double - talk,
containing such phrases as "aware
ness ol the essential situation,"
"caught in the midst of life," "em
body the quality," "integrated work
of shattering force," "man's relation
to necessity," etc.
At one point it stales that
| "there is a new generation of film
j makers who have no intention of
subjecting their work to commer
cial meaninglessne.s.s." This di

rectly implies that such items as
"Death of a Salesman," "Detec
tive Story," "Ace in the Hole," "A
Place in the Sun," "Streetcar,"
etc., are—because financially suc
cessful—meaningless.
Kinesis, of course, is free to print
what it wishes. Yet it would seem
that the organization is failing in
its purpose, which should be to in
troduce more people tu the worthi
ness ol the avant-garde film, and
is instead aiming its appeal strictly
at the arty set.
What we would like to empha
size is that, despite the adver
tising circular, many of the Ki
nesis films will he rc-ally worth
seeing. The art film plays a de
cided and important role in the
cinematic world, and anyone in
terested in movies will do well to
follow the progress of the experi
mentalists.
Dead horses and pianos, when
not passed off as symbolizing "the
strident urgency of the Now," can
be, after all, very amusing—and be
yond such tongue-in-cheek diver
sions, the experimental movie mak-
I ers are responsible for other films
I of great interest, depth, and insight.
They deserve a following.
Tickets can be purchased at the
Skyline, 444 Cowper in Palo Alto.
The price for the series, which runs
on alternate Thursdays through
June 5, is $4.50, and single admis
sion is $1.10.
Salvador Dali, he of the melt

to strap a couple of dead nags

This thoroughly incongruous
("surrealistic") piece of furniture

movie camera and emerged as a
