# Village Rumor Is Unfounded
## 
### 
Rumors that the government in
planning to tuke over Stanford Vil- |
!age are entirely unfounded, Direc
tor of Information Fred Glover has
announced.
Glover said that Stanford leases
the Village from the government
for six months to a year. The lease
time limit is governed by law. The
present lease extends to June. At
that time, it is assumed the lease
will be renewed, as it has been reg
ularly in the past.
