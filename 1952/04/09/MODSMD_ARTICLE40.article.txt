# Stanford Errors in Tenth Give San Diego 5-3 Win
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
Five Stanford errors in the tenth inning cost Stanford a ball
game yesterday in the Sunken Diamond. San Diego State's Jim
Poole and Stanford's Mike Acker were hooked up in a pitcher's
duel when Stanford's usually reliable infield fell apart to give the
Aztecs a 5-3 win.
Stanford opened up the scoring in the fourth when Dave Rosen-

krantz walked, and went to second*♦
ori the first of Jack Shepard's three
hits. The Cards executed a neat
double-steal and then Chuck Esseg
ian hit a two-run single past third
base.
The Aztecs, who defeated the
powerful USC Trojans last week,
evened up the score in the sixth
inning when they tagged starter Bob
Murphy for a double, a bloop single,
and two walks tor two tallies. The
fast-balling Murphy was very effec
tive during his (i inning stint giving
up tour hits and fanning six men.
Milce Acker then took over for the
Cards and matched slow stufl' with
Poole throughout the retit of the
contest.
In the seventh Stanford stirred up
a small breeze when Acker and .
Scramaglia singled, but they died on 1
the basepaths.
The next frame found San Diego <
scoring on a long double to left- j
center by Paul Smith and two Card ! .
miscues by Rich Scramaglia at first, j

Stanford bounced back in their half
of the frame when Jack Shepard and
Chuck Essegian, who have turned
into a spectacular one-two punch,
both singled through the infield.
Shepard came home when Owen
Powell dumped a single into left
field. Essegian was thrown out try
ing to go to third.
After a scoreless ninth inning, t-he
Aztecs scored the v/inning two runs.
Acker started the chaos with a wild
throw to first.
After a pop-up to Goodrich at
short, the usually flawless-fielding
Goodrich tried too hard for a double
play and dropped the boll. Next,
third-baseman Ray Swartz kicked
the ball around and then threw it
away while two runs scored.
Shepard got on by an error in the
bottom half of the frame, but Stan
ford was unable to connect with
Pooles' tantalizing offerings.
Acker took the loss, but it was
poor fielding that upended the Cards
yesterday.

Poole and Stanford's Mike Acker were hooked up in a pitcher's
duel when Stanford's usually reliable infield fell apart to give the
Aztecs a 5-3 win.
Stanford opened up the scoring in the fourth when Dave Rosen-

krantz walked, and went to second*♦
ori the first of Jack Shepard's three
hits. The Cards executed a neat
double-steal and then Chuck Esseg
ian hit a two-run single past third
base.
The Aztecs, who defeated the
powerful USC Trojans last week,
evened up the score in the sixth
inning when they tagged starter Bob
Murphy for a double, a bloop single,
and two walks tor two tallies. The
fast-balling Murphy was very effec
tive during his (i inning stint giving
up tour hits and fanning six men.
Milce Acker then took over for the
Cards and matched slow stufl' with
Poole throughout the retit of the
contest.
In the seventh Stanford stirred up
a small breeze when Acker and .
Scramaglia singled, but they died on 1
the basepaths.
The next frame found San Diego <
scoring on a long double to left- j
center by Paul Smith and two Card ! .
miscues by Rich Scramaglia at first, j

Stanford bounced back in their half
of the frame when Jack Shepard and
Chuck Essegian, who have turned
into a spectacular one-two punch,
both singled through the infield.
Shepard came home when Owen
Powell dumped a single into left
field. Essegian was thrown out try
ing to go to third.
After a scoreless ninth inning, t-he
Aztecs scored the v/inning two runs.
Acker started the chaos with a wild
throw to first.
After a pop-up to Goodrich at
short, the usually flawless-fielding
Goodrich tried too hard for a double
play and dropped the boll. Next,
third-baseman Ray Swartz kicked
the ball around and then threw it
away while two runs scored.
Shepard got on by an error in the
bottom half of the frame, but Stan
ford was unable to connect with
Pooles' tantalizing offerings.
Acker took the loss, but it was
poor fielding that upended the Cards
yesterday.
