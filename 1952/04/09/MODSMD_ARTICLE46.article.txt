they face the Trojans in a twin bill
on the Sunken Diamond.

Last Friday, the polo team <was
guested on Frankie Albert's KRON
TV show to advertise the series of
Bay Area tournaments which will
begin the end of April. Stanford
plans to enter both the six- and
eight-goal events.
During the recent vacation, the
team journeyed to Roswell, N.M..
to play a two-game series with the
New Mexico Military Institute. The
Cards lost both matches, 5-4, 8-7,
but this was no disgrace as the
NMMI are intercollegiate indoor
champions.
