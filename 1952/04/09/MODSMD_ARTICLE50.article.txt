### 
Thomas G. Lnnphicr Jr., Stanford
graduate and former Air Force pi

initiation ceremonies of the Lan
phier Squadron of the Arnold Air

Lanphier is credited with shoot
ing down the plane of Japanese Ad
miral Isoroku Yamamoto, com
mander - in - chief of the Imperial
Navy.
The Squadron, a chapter of the
Air Force lIOTC honorary society,
is named in honor of the Lanphier
brothers, Thomas and Charles, both
Stanford graduates and fighter pi
lot heroes of World War 11.
Lanphier joined the Air Force in

1941, and soon became a front-line
fighter pilot. In 1943, he shot down
Admiral Yamamoto's bomber, and
with it the man who was reported
j to have boasted that the Japs would
I dictate peace terms from the White
l House.
The news could not be told at the
time because Lanphier's brother,
Charles, was in a prison camp,
| where he later died of starvation.
The pilot, after leaving the Air
Force, has held many government
j jobs in connection with the Air
Force and represented Stuart Sy
| mington on the National Security
Council senior staff.
