# Smog, TV Investigated By SRI Scientists
## Researchers Double Staff in 1951 
### DAVE SEELEY 
Investigating the smog prob
lem in Los Angeles and devel
oping a throe - color television
tube are only two of the many
research projects the Stanford
Research Institute has been
working on lately.
SRI, an independent organiza
tion sponsored by the University
i and a group of prominent West
Coast industrialists, has been dt
: reeling fact-finding research under
contract for industry and govern
ment, as well as going ahead with
its own projects since 1940.
Four hundred and fifty people are
I doing research at the rate ol $4,-
000,000 annually.
The Institute's relationship with
the University has been a vital
factor in its growth and Miccess
during th? past five yerrac
cording to its recent'y published
annual report. Although it is not
directly connected with Stanford,
faculty assistance in the form of
project and individual consulta
tion have added a ,'jroat deal to
the quality of the research accom
| plished.
An arrangement between the two
has found several /nembers of the
Institute's staff giving courses and
I guest lectures at the University last
I year. Dr. Sterling is chairman of
j SRl's board of directors, and Dr.
Whitaker, provost, is vice-chairman.
During IJJSI the Institute grew
I r c in en d o us I y in manpower,

funds, s*ikl equipment. A (i I pc
cent increase in full-time staff
during the year has been re
ported.
According to Dr. J. E. Hobson,
director of the Institute, this growth
has enabled SRI to offer greater and
more diversified services to West
ern industry.
The Institute has tried to meet
industry's immediate needs for
jro uetion and process develop
ment, increased efficienev. and
customers' desires. Research un
dertaken this past year has been
especially helnful to the relatively
new industries on the West Coast,
such as aviation and electronics.
SRI is organized into five major
departments: engineering, chemistry
and chemical engineering, business
and industrial economics, applied
physics, and applied biology.
Not all located ound its head
quarters in the Stanford Village,
SRI has field laboratories for spe
cie! prr'ects in Portland, Pasa
dena, and near Salt Lake City,
and nlso ;• divisional headquar
ters in downtown Los Angeles to
serve Southern California.
Part of the international staff j
worked hist year in Italy, conduct
ing a survey of mechanical indus
tries for the Italian government and
ECA. SRI has also been active in
South America and Korea.
In support of the national de
fense program, the Institute has as
si ted industrial contractors and the
government with engineering and
techno-economic aspects of numer
ous large and complicated produc
tion and fact-finding problems.
Although SRI has in the past
had only 25 per cent of its re
search work under government
contract, during the present na- |
tional emergency it has been nee- :
cssary to double this work. One !
of the Institute's major current !
projects is experimenting with a
new system of aircraft antennas
located in the skin of the airplane.
Some of the more interesting un
dertakings of SRI last year for pri
vate industry were studies in dif
ferences in almonds, an examina
tion into the railway - highway
grade-crossing problem in Califor
nia, and investigation into the Pa
cific Coast newsprint production and |
supply situation.
The food research division inves
tigated relative values of fresh and
frozen food, the causes for discolo
ration of baby foods, and the de- j
velopment of new fish by-products.
For the AEC the Institute's econo
mists studied the industrial uses i
of radioactive fission products, and
for the Navy they determined the i
requirements for machine tools of j
all types to support defense pro- I
duction programs.

During IJJSI the Institute grew

According to Dr. J. E. Hobson,

The Institute has tried to meet

SRI is organized into five major
departments: engineering, chemistry
and chemical engineering, business
and industrial economics, applied
physics, and applied biology.

In support of the national de

Although SRI has in the past
had only 25 per cent of its re

located in the skin of the airplane.
Some of the more interesting un

The food research division inves

velopment of new fish by-products.
For the AEC the Institute's econo
