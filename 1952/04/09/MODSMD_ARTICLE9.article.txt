# Taft, Kefauver Sweep Illinois Primary Vote
## 
### 
CHICAGO, April 8 (UP) —Lien. Robert A. Tatt of Ohio held a
six to one lead over Harold E. Stassen in the Illinois Republican
Presidential Primary tonight with Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower in
third place on write-in votes.
'l he Ohioan appeared to be running away with lhe election with

more than a third of the vote
counted. lie was more than 100,000
votes ahead of all opponents.
Gen. Eolavj Kefauver of Tennessee,
unopposed on the Democratic bal
lot, was far out 111 front of a smat
tering of write-in candidates, in
cluding Gov. Adlai E. StevenLon
of Illinois. But tabulations of
write-ins for Stevenson were trail
ing, chiefly in Cook County.
Latest Returns
Returns from 4,421 of 0,011 pre
cincts, including 3,520 in Cook
County, gave Taft 325,005 votes,
Stassen 53,1 14, and Bender 10,548.
Write-ins counted in 4,034 pre
cincts i howed Eisenhower with
I 44,061 votes and Mac Arthur with
3,002.
On the Democratic ticket Kefau
ver had 250,357 from 4,421 precincts
and Stevenson had 2,200 write-ins
in 1,000 precincts.
In a heavy vote that was believed
| to have hit 2,000,000, Taft started
J out ahead both in populous Cook
i County and in downstate areas, and
widened the gap on his rivals as the
returns rolled in.
The Ohio Senator was strongly
backed by the state GOP organiza
tion and also was favored by the
isolationist leanings of the state.
Write-ins Mis-fire
Write-in drives for Eisenhower
and Stevenson apparently had mis
i fired. Stevenxon, however, had dis
| couraged any write -in vote for
j President and Eisenhower backers
had refrained from calling their ef-
I forts an outright "campaign."
In addition to Stassen and Taft,
the formal GOP ballot listed politi
cally unknown Riley Bender, who
i drew a scattering of votes.
The primary was the fifth in the
I nation thus far and the largest from
the standpoint of delegates elected
lo the national conventions.
The race is a "popularity contest"
I among the candidates. Fifty dele
[ gates each to the national conven-
I (ions were chosen on the GOP and
Democratic ballots, but delegates
are not bound by the results of the
popular vote.
Sunny, balmy weather prevailed
over most of the state. An estimated

55 per cent of the big Chicago vote
was cast by noon, and in rural areas
farmers left their fields despite the
good weather to go to the polls.

CHICAGO, April 8 (UP) —Lien. Robert A. Tatt of Ohio held a
six to one lead over Harold E. Stassen in the Illinois Republican
Presidential Primary tonight with Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower in
third place on write-in votes.
'l he Ohioan appeared to be running away with lhe election with

more than a third of the vote
counted. lie was more than 100,000
votes ahead of all opponents.
Gen. Eolavj Kefauver of Tennessee,
unopposed on the Democratic bal
lot, was far out 111 front of a smat
tering of write-in candidates, in
cluding Gov. Adlai E. StevenLon
of Illinois. But tabulations of
write-ins for Stevenson were trail
ing, chiefly in Cook County.
Latest Returns
Returns from 4,421 of 0,011 pre
cincts, including 3,520 in Cook
County, gave Taft 325,005 votes,
Stassen 53,1 14, and Bender 10,548.
Write-ins counted in 4,034 pre
cincts i howed Eisenhower with
I 44,061 votes and Mac Arthur with
3,002.
On the Democratic ticket Kefau
ver had 250,357 from 4,421 precincts
and Stevenson had 2,200 write-ins
in 1,000 precincts.
In a heavy vote that was believed
| to have hit 2,000,000, Taft started
J out ahead both in populous Cook
i County and in downstate areas, and
widened the gap on his rivals as the
returns rolled in.
The Ohio Senator was strongly
backed by the state GOP organiza
tion and also was favored by the
isolationist leanings of the state.
Write-ins Mis-fire
Write-in drives for Eisenhower
and Stevenson apparently had mis
i fired. Stevenxon, however, had dis
| couraged any write -in vote for
j President and Eisenhower backers

I forts an outright "campaign."
