# Hears Varied Gripes
## 
### 
The I-one Woman Rule, campus
j telephones, library hours, and the
I Boathoir.e dock were all given a
[ cursory once over last night as Ex -
com in its regular weekly meeting
i considered some student gripes.
The Lone Woman Rule came up
j for a general discussion, but since
| other groups are now considering
that problem, a formal decision was
withheld by Excom. The Committee
deciderl to wait, until it receives a
formal recommendation from the
I Fundamental Standard Committee or
i the AWS.
In its brief discussion of the rule,
Excom considered such factors as the
I greater burden of responsibility on
the woman if the rule is eliminated
I and the vagueness of the rule as it
I stands.
Frosh representative Jack Eraser
| brought up the question of getting
j a campus-wide telephone exchange
including Roble, Lagunita, and Ven
j lura halls as well as those dorms
i now on the Toyon exchange. This
dormitory exchange would have a
common switchboard something like
the general University switchboard.
The idea of limited service phones,
] now in use in some Row houses, was
j suggested, but discussion on this
| question was passed over since that
problem "concerns the living groups
[ and not Excom."
Eraser also brought up the ques
tion of library hours, lie explained
| that some students would like the
j University to maintain some sort of
reading or study room open until
; 12 midnight. The library was thought
of as the most likely place.
The problem of getting a "splinter
| a step" on the Boathouse dock also
| came under brief scrutiny. Busi
j ties Manager George Denny ex
plained that the repairs must wait
until summertime since the repair
job is an extensive operation.

In other action, Excom approved
a change in the 111? By-laws, and

The I-one Woman Rule, campus
j telephones, library hours, and the
I Boathoir.e dock were all given a
[ cursory once over last night as Ex -
com in its regular weekly meeting
i considered some student gripes.
The Lone Woman Rule came up
j for a general discussion, but since
| other groups are now considering
that problem, a formal decision was
withheld by Excom. The Committee
deciderl to wait, until it receives a
formal recommendation from the
I Fundamental Standard Committee or
i the AWS.
In its brief discussion of the rule,
Excom considered such factors as the
I greater burden of responsibility on
the woman if the rule is eliminated
I and the vagueness of the rule as it
I stands.
Frosh representative Jack Eraser
| brought up the question of getting
j a campus-wide telephone exchange
including Roble, Lagunita, and Ven
j lura halls as well as those dorms

dormitory exchange would have a
common switchboard something like
the general University switchboard.
The idea of limited service phones,

j suggested, but discussion on this
| question was passed over since that
problem "concerns the living groups
