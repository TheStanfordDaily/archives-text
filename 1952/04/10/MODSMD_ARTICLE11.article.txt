# 'Abnormal' Sex Behavior Can Be Normal Depending on Point of View, Says Kinsey
## 
### 
"It is high time that we stop and
intelligently consider what is 1101
nial and abnormal in sexual be
havior."
This challenge was offered to more
than 1,800 members of the student
body anrl faculty by Dr. Alfred C.
Kinsey, renowned author and stu
dent of sexual behavior, in an ad
dress on I be "Concepts of Normality
and Abnormality in Sexual Be
havior'' yesterday afternoon in Me
morial Auditorium.
Normal vs. Abnormal
Sai'l Dr. Kinsey, "The terms nor
mal and abnormal mean totally dif
ferent things to different
depending on the individual's back-,
ground." The doctor then proceeded
to cite as examples the views of sex
ual normality as interpreted by the
statistician, the moralist, the biolo
gist. and the anthropologist.
Elaborating first the statistical
point of view, Dr. Kinsey explained
that in this vein, normality is gen
erally interpreted as that practice
which most frequently occurs, or the
"usual" behavior.
Whereas socially, much of the
normality of sexual behavior is
baser) on such codes as the ancicnt
Jewish viewpoint that any sexual
activity which does nol lead to pro
creation is a perversion- statistically
the situation is quite different.
Perversion
Figures given by Dr. Kinsey i
showed that masturbation, a "per- j

version" by the Jewish and other
philosophies in our culture, occurs
in 95 to 98 pet cent of the human
males in our society Said Dr. Kin
sey, Ihe figures show that mastur
bation provides much Ihe major por
tion of sexual release in unmarried
males.
The frequency of masturbation in
females, while less, is still such that
a majority of females have practiced !
it, thus showing that this "perverted"
activity is "hardly abnormal in our
society on a statistical interpreta
tion."
Dr. Kinsey further demonstrating
the statistical incongruity with the
social "norm" gave figures concern
ing intensive petting, showing that
of the youngest generation of Ameri
can college youth, 99 per cent do
some extensive petting befoie mar
riage.
Continuing, Dr. Kinsey examined
how the activities of sexual behavior
arise, and presented an analysis of
the physiological factors involved.
He described the basic physiological
sexual response, which he explained
was not under voluntary control, but
rather under the control of the au
tonomic nervous system.
The fact thai the same physiologi -
cal symptoms of sexual behavior arc
evident throughout all the mam
malia was emphasized by Kinsey.
And at the same time he explained
that there is no basic difference in I

the response between male and fe
male.
Condemns Legislature
De. Kinsey condemned those leg
islative provisions which declaie as
crimes all "acts contrary to nature,"
referring to "perverted" sexual ac
tivity. Said Kinsey, "no act is con
trary to nature unless it is so by ac
quired cultural restraint "
Ihe different sorts of moral inter
pretations were analyzed by Kinsey,
and he pointed out that most are
simply rationalizations Citing one
in particular—that homosexuality im
morally wrong because society just
couldn't continue to exist without
procreation Dr Kinsey pointed to
the Buddhist and Moslem culture:;
which both accept homosexuality,
and which both have given forth
dense populations.
No type of sexual activity is not
accepted in some-society somewhere
on the earth, said Kinsey, and con
trarily, there is almost no sexual
activity which is not condemned in
some society. As an example he said
that premarital sex relations are
taboo only in one other society be
sides our own
But whatever be the actuality,
statistically, biologically, or other*
wise, De. KinseyMixplained that it is
to the advantage of the individual
to confoem to the custom of hi own
society, not because it is right or
wrong, but rather because it is
socially acceptable.— VV. M.
