# Kefauver, His Wife and Coonskin, Hit California
## Mrs. Kefauver Questioned--- About Family, Politics, Estes 
### SUE WHEAT 
The charming, hav. el-eyed red
head shook her head at the offered
J cigarette and, balancing a cup of
! black coffee, settled back in her
I chair.
i She is Mrs. Estes Kefauver, po
' tential First l.ady of the Land, who
j in a Daily interview in a Mark
; Hopkins suite yesterday, told of
j her experiences as the wife of the
'energetic Tennessee Senator cam
paigning for the Democratic Presi
dential nomination.
Born iu Glasgow
In a delightful Scottish accent
I (she was born in Glasgow), Mr .
j Kefauver explained her part, in her
\ husband':; campaign: "My arm is
| weak from hand-shaking. And I'm
always trying to catch tip wilh
thank-you letters to the last work
| ers who have helped us.'
Mr;. Kefauver does not go out
1 of her way to meet the public. "I
only speak in a pinch," she said.
1 "For instance, when we're going
into tmall towns I sometimes am in
; the car preceding Estes, but then I
: only give people general briefings
: and hope that he is not far behind
me."
Political Discussion
When asked if she discussed poli
tics widi her husband, Mrs. Ke
fauver answered, "Yes, I suppose I
do. We discuss things us they come
j along. Usually, we don't have much
j time to philosophize 011 general is
sues."
Mrs. Kefauver has been called
the "real force" behind her hus
band. She denied ibis, however,
and said that it is not true that she
j even encouraged the Senator to
! seek the nomination.
"Then you're discouraging it?"
we asked.
"No," she stated, "I don't think

it does much good once youi hus
band starts something. It's more
fun now jir 1 to go along wilh him."
Wrong Shoes
Once during the flurry of cam
paign travel, Mrs. Kefauver packed
her husband's. • uitcase for him and
forgot to put in a pair of black
shoes which he needed to attend a
bnaquet. Undaunted, the lanky
Senator secured a pair by swap
ping his brown ones with an ele
vator boy.
Kefauver war; :til1 irritated, how
ever (the elevator boy's shoes
turned up at the toes), and an
nounced to his wife, ' Next time,
I'll pack my own hag."
The next tune, the Senatoi DID
pack his own bag and upon arriv
ing in their room-, he opened it arid
said to his wile, "See? I brought
ni v black shoes." He proudly held
them up they were for the same
fool.
Mrs, Kefauver laughed as she
finished the story: "Well, be wore
them," she said, "but I think he
kicked I hem ofT under the dinner
table and walked home in his
socks."
The 41 -year old Mrs. Kefauver
is trim (5 feet 7 inches, l!>5 pounds)
and smart looking; one would guess
her age us .15. She was wearing a
tailored gray suit wilh a red rose
(no significance, she explained) in
the lapel.
While House Move
"Would a move to the While
House involve a big adjustment for
you?" we asked.
"It changes your home life," she
explained. "We'd have ta make an
effort to keep things going on an
even keel—although that shouldn't
be too hard with children and ani
mals all over the place." (The Ke
fauvers have four children, all un

do ten. The it firmly pets include
two cod' r, i ;, a cat. and a de-odor
tzed ,skunk.)
Educated in '>cytlard, Mrs. h?-
fauver later ,-tudied art in Louden
and Pari For a while she worked
iu London, designing dresses and
doing book i I hi (rations. "I still
paint when f can."
Mrs, Kefauvet met the Tennr
lawyer in her early twenties upon
her first vi it to thi ■ country it was
a blind dale, followed hei back
If) Scotland and a year later in H)Jr»
they were married there.
< onnskin ( M'
Fn describing the origin of her
husband's famed cootr-kin cap, Mr
Kefauver said that when it was first
suggested as a gag, "We thought i (
was silly and corny. But soon the
Tennessee farmer; were coming
from all over to sec 'the man in the
coonskin cap'.''
Hunters, she added, are forever
making the caps and sending them
to the Kefauvers. "I can't tell you
HOW many coonskin caps we have
around the house!" she exclaimed.
