# Red Cross Blood Drive—A Challenge
## 
### 
Last fall the Red Cross Bloodmobile came to
campus for one day. Stanford responded with
an overwhelming number of donors, oversub
scribing a goal of 200 pints by an additional
148, or nearly 175 per cent of the original ex
pectations. One hundred fifty persons had to
be turned away simply because there just was
n't the appointment time—and, as it was, the
Red Cross blood gatherers stayed open until G
in ihe evening to take all the comers possible.
This quarter, the call is goinq out again.
And this quarter, because oi the response last
tail, the lied Cross team will be on campus
for two days. A quota of 700 pints has been
set by the diive's organizers, the Stanford
Student Health Committee, directed by Pete
llalle. This quota, coupled with the vital need
loi whole blood and blood plasma, otlers a
challe je—a challenge which we miqht well
tackle with great enthusiasm.
The students at the Universities of Texas and
Washington did tackle this challenge with an
unparalleled enthusiasm, highlighting their
drives for their liquid of life with burlesque at
tractions and various other entertainment
means appealing to the sensual, charging a do
nation of blood as the admission price. By
these means, these two student bodies were
able to collect phenomenal amounts of blood.
But there is a most serious side to this matter
of donating blood.
Currently blood is playing a major role in
saving casualties both on the Korean battle
front and here at home in disaster areas, as in
the recent Arkansas and Louisiana tornadoes.
Blood has been credited with playing a large
role in setting a new record low death rate
among wounded men in war.

With incentive lactors like these, do we
need sensual attiactions to provide enthusi
asm lor giving blood? Pete llalle and his
committee dori't believe so, and we agree.
There is something deeper than a burlesque
show that makes us want to qive blood—that
old bug called patriotism.
We've been bitten by that bug, and we think
others have been too. But the fact remains that
for most of us, the permission to give blood is
the prerogative ol om parents and not our
selves alone. For that reason, it is all-important
that those of us who desire to give blood but
who are yet under 21 send home now the par
ental permission slips which have been dis
tributed to campus living groups.
While off-campus students —who proved to
be by far the greatest donors last fall— may pick
up and have their parental permission slips
filled when the appointment booth is set up,
the time is short lor those of us who must send
home for permission to give blood.
The appointment booth will be maintained
at the Cellar next week on V/ednesday,
Thursday, and Friday, and again the follow
ing Monday. The next Tuesday and Wednes
day, April 22 and 23, the Bed Cross Blood
Team will come to Stanlord.
Giving blood is sale and easy, and there is
no harm whatsoever to the donor. There is no
pain. Red Cross figures show that about one
fourth of all donors are people who have given
belore—those who know how simple and how
important it really is.
Primarily, giving blood is good citizenship.
Our own life may sometime depend on it. —

at the Cellar next week on V/ednesday,
Thursday, and Friday, and again the follow
ing Monday. The next Tuesday and Wednes
day, April 22 and 23, the Bed Cross Blood
Team will come to Stanlord.
Giving blood is sale and easy, and there is
no harm whatsoever to the donor. There is no
pain. Red Cross figures show that about one
fourth of all donors are people who have given
belore—those who know how simple and how
important it really is.
Primarily, giving blood is good citizenship.
Our own life may sometime depend on it. —

Last fall the Red Cross Bloodmobile came to
campus for one day. Stanford responded with
an overwhelming number of donors, oversub
scribing a goal of 200 pints by an additional
148, or nearly 175 per cent of the original ex
pectations. One hundred fifty persons had to
be turned away simply because there just was
n't the appointment time—and, as it was, the
Red Cross blood gatherers stayed open until G
in ihe evening to take all the comers possible.
This quarter, the call is goinq out again.
And this quarter, because oi the response last
tail, the lied Cross team will be on campus
for two days. A quota of 700 pints has been
set by the diive's organizers, the Stanford
Student Health Committee, directed by Pete
llalle. This quota, coupled with the vital need
loi whole blood and blood plasma, otlers a
challe je—a challenge which we miqht well
tackle with great enthusiasm.
The students at the Universities of Texas and
Washington did tackle this challenge with an
unparalleled enthusiasm, highlighting their
drives for their liquid of life with burlesque at
tractions and various other entertainment
means appealing to the sensual, charging a do
nation of blood as the admission price. By
these means, these two student bodies were
able to collect phenomenal amounts of blood.
But there is a most serious side to this matter
of donating blood.
Currently blood is playing a major role in
saving casualties both on the Korean battle
front and here at home in disaster areas, as in
the recent Arkansas and Louisiana tornadoes.
Blood has been credited with playing a large
role in setting a new record low death rate
among wounded men in war.

With incentive lactors like these, do we
need sensual attiactions to provide enthusi
asm lor giving blood? Pete llalle and his
committee dori't believe so, and we agree.
There is something deeper than a burlesque
show that makes us want to qive blood—that
old bug called patriotism.
We've been bitten by that bug, and we think
others have been too. But the fact remains that
for most of us, the permission to give blood is
the prerogative ol om parents and not our
selves alone. For that reason, it is all-important
that those of us who desire to give blood but
who are yet under 21 send home now the par
ental permission slips which have been dis
tributed to campus living groups.
While off-campus students —who proved to
be by far the greatest donors last fall— may pick
up and have their parental permission slips
filled when the appointment booth is set up,
the time is short lor those of us who must send
home for permission to give blood.
The appointment booth will be maintained
at the Cellar next week on V/ednesday,
Thursday, and Friday, and again the follow
ing Monday. The next Tuesday and Wednes
