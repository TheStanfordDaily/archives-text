# CAMPUS OPINION
## Time for Public Stand on Crew 
### 
TO THE EDITORS, OP MORE SPECIFICALLY,
TO THE SAB:
Recently, an article stating that the Stanford Crew
had again been refused financial support by the
S.A.B. appeared in the Daily.
It is not my purpose to do any rabble-rousing, or
make rabid statements concerning the policies of that
board. They know what they are doing a lot better
than any outsider could hope to know. The problems
and expenses of maintaining the outstanding athletic
sv-tem which Stanford has developed are great.
At.-jo, as has often been pointed out, rowing is a
sport which is capable of raising no spectator revenue.
These are tacts which cannot be overlooked.
Ihc Stanford Crew, in this Olympic year, was
turned down in the request for funds to continue the
season, and to compete in the IRA Regatta, and to
represent Stanford in the Olympic Trials. It was
1 lined down on the grounds that the granting of
such financial support would establish a precedent.
There is no point in going into a lengthy discussion
of the advisability of what has been done. There is,
likewise, nothing to be gained by relating the fine
record which the Crew has built up. There is, how
ever, much to be said for the prestige and plain
publicity which the Crew has brought to Stanford by
its accomplishments attained through sheer determi
nation. True, some of the publicity may have been
adverse toward the administration of athletic policy
circles, and in the hrge numbers of people who follow
here but it is a certainty that everyone in rowing
the sport, has developed the greatest respect for these
representatives of Farm life.
*e the re-establishment of rowing in 194G, an
incredible amount of work has gone into the main
tenance of the sport. Each fall, the oncoming season
has been regarded as "the year" in which the oars
men would win themselves a place in the list of
athletics on the campus which find complete or par
tial support through the University. Each year, this
goal has been missed. This brings me to the main
point.
THE TIME HAS COME FOR THE S.A.B. TO
MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT CONCERNING
FUTURE PLANS FOR FINANCING THE CREW.
The oarsmen can't be strung along forever; if they
cren't ever going to get financial aid, they should
not '. o led to think so. And one thing is sure; the
Stanford Crew can never realize its full potential as
long ns it is forced to expend a large portion of its
enthusiasm and energy in the "begging" that it has
had to do in order to survive.
The question resolves itself to one of whether or
not rowing brings enough benefit to the campus to
make it worth one and a half percent of the athletic
budget. It is my opinion that it is well worth that and
far more.
In conclusion, may it be clear that niy own position
is that of a former oarsman, and that 1 have no con
nection whatsoever with the Crew Association at the
present time. Mine is no other interest than the
preservation of a sport which presents no financial
advantages to the school, but which, in my opinion,
112 j overshadows this drawback by the worth which
it offer in prestige, and in enjoyment and inspiration
to it 1 ; many participants.
