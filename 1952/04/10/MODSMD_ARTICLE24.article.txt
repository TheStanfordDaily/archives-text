# 'Sanctioning Thievery'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
There are two classes of people at Stanford: fl)
those who attend Stanford because they are fairly
well oft financially; (2) those who, because they
attend Stanford, are broke.
The fact that Stanford is both an excellent school
in some fields and expensive, accounts for the exist
ence of class 2. Class 1 is apparently oblivious to
the existence of cluss 2.
Mr. Blumberg belongs to class 2 and as he points
ont, possessions have come by dint of much hard
work. He or 1 will not take lightly either petty
thievery or admonitions to take it easy by class 1.
flow iVIf. Crothe, who presumably subscribes to
the Fundamental Standard, can sanction thievery
with a straight face is quite beyond me. (Lent is
irrelevant.) Mr. Bartlon's juvenile attempt at humor
is even worse. Is it any wonder people turn up in
our government who have no respect for others'
property?
