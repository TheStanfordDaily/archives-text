# No 'A' for Film Society
## 
### 
To the Editor:
We teel that Dick Fred ell's article on the Peninsula
Film Society, April iitli, misrepresented the society
and, we are afraid, discouraged people from coming
to the film series.
Early in the article he says that the return of the
Peninsula Film Society is "good news for those who
like their art spelled with a capital 'A'." It is hardly
fair to stigmatize as '"arty" or "pseudo" anyone who
is interested in the experimental film society—es
pecially since Mr. Fredell himself says later in the
article "anyone interested in movies will do well to
follow the progress of the experimentalists."
Apparently, Mr. Fredell has no objection to the
films themselves (except for a Dali film not even on
this year's program). His whole diatribe was based on
his dislike of certain phrases in an advertising bro
chure—phrases which in or out of context do not
strike readers as being "arty double talk."
Mr. Fredell based his criticism not on the films
themselves but on the brochure, and the negative
aspects of his criticism far out-weighed the favor
able comments. We feel it is unjustified, on such
slight pretext, to discourage people from attending
the films.
The Peninsula Film Society presents its first pro
gram tonight at 8:15 at Paly High. On the basis of
having enjoyed the experimental films last year and
of the success of this year's program, shown already
in Berkeley, we can only encourage others to go.
We can assure them that they will have a unique
and delightful evening.
