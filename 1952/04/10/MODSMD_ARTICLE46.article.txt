frame and the Aztecs tallied on a
stolen base and a fielder's choice.
Back came the Cards in the fourth
at? Dick Corzine went to second while
San Diego's shortstop threw the ball
away. Page sacrificed him to third
and Rich Scramaglia ground him in
with a single between short and
third.
In the fourth De Long replaced
Page, who looks ready for this week
ends crucials if needed. De Long
came in and left in the fifth. He had
his stuff, but not his control as he
walked three and struck out one,
before Ken Brown took over. With
the bases loaded, catcher Corzine
trapped a man off third and then
Brown forced Aztec Paul Held to hit
back to him. Brown mowed down
the San Diegomen through the next
two frames to gain the win.
The Cards scored what proved to
be the winning marker in the fifth
when Corzine doubled. Fred Brown
bunted in front of the plate, and San
Diego's catcher attempted the play
at third. He was called safe in a
much-disputed play and Rich Scra
maglia again batted in Corzine.
The game was called at the end of
seven innings because of darkness.
