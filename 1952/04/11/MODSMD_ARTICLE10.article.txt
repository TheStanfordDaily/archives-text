# Thinclads Seek Win Over UCLA
## 
### DICK KLEIN Daily Sports Editor 
With only the weather to worry about, Coach Jack Weiershauser
will send his win-happy thinclads against a so-so UCLA track
squad tomorrow in the big Stadium. Field events begin at 1:30
with the first race scheduled to get underway at 2 p.m.
According to latest reports, the fast-drying Stadium runway is

still lightning fast and all times
should be excellent in the hotly
contested flat races. Television sta
tion KPIX will flash the meet over
the screens from 2 to 3:30 This is
the first dual meet ever telecasted in
the Bay Area.
The Indians have 'lie stuff to
j pile up a big point-total over Coach
Ducky Drakes' undermanned out
fit. Top performer for the Brums
is .jumping Oeorge Brown, real
I Olympic material in the broad
jump. He hit over the 2t>' mark
j in Japan last summer, and is
' rounding into shape.
Only other sure blue ribbon win
ners are Dave Rosellini in the low
barriers and Len Eilers in the pole
vault. Ilod Richards should grab <>R
one of the sprint races. In the shot,
javelin, and discus the Westwooder:,
are pitifully weak.
Wciershauser's well- balanced
J team is in top shape. Only man
who is definitely scratched from
performing is sprinter Bob iVlagee
who will sit the meet out and rest.
Besides Maury Parsons, the con
sistent performer, l,nren Sorenson,
! Keith Brownsberger, Jim (jallagh
cr, ami Ai Mendel will go in the
dashes.
Bob Mathias will try only live
events this weekend. Me is entered
in the high and low hurdles, pole
vault, discus, and javelin. The de
| cathlon king should rack up a mere
19 points, including two firsts.
Top races and lop times should
he turned in the two longer events,
I the mile and two mile. Bob Simon
should he pushed to thr hrst 'ime
of his career by Larry Carter in
the four-lapper. Carter has already
j run 4:17.•>, but Card Bob was
hardly pressed in doing a 1:18.(» last
I weekend.
In the lung-breaking two-miler,
frosh Bob F'eed will have Marty
Donahue and his 1):40.(> time to con-
I tend with. The flashy freshman may
hit somewhere in the middle 9:l'o's.
Competitors in both the 440 and
880 have not run anywhere near to
{ expected form, hut tomorrow's
! races should produce some vastly
j improved times. Fred (ieorge,
i Bill Friedriehs, and Stan Dawson
! will he Indian entries in the quar
ter. Wally McCamant and John
YVooley arc the Farm's main hopes
i in the half.
Hottest development out, on the
practice loop during the week beside
the continued rain was the return of
Don Carlson. A versatile performer,
Carlson is definitely set for the shot
put and may be the fourth man on
the mile relay team.
Helping pile up nearly !>(> points
j for the Cards, will he three clean
sweps in the discus, shot, and jave
lin. Newcomer Howie Hertz, the
250-lh transfer from Mt. San An
tonio JC, looks belter and better
in the shot and should also pick up
j a third in the discus. Another new
face is Leo Long, top-lligbt spear
tosser.
