### BARBARA TUERK 
"There is no contradiction be
tween absolute national inde- 1
pendence nnd close collabora-1
tion 112 or collective defense
against a common enemy," Dr.'
Ales Beblor, Permanent UN Rep
resentative frcm Yugoslavia, em-1
phasized, as he smilingly out
lined the basic attitudes of his ;
country in a hurried intervinw
with the D*ily on Wednesday.
Dr. Reblet* and his wife, a charm- |
ing and very interested sight-seer, !
were guests of (tie Hoover L.ibrary |
(in their brief visit at. Stanford,
squeezed in among busy days of
speaking engagement's in San Fran- |
cisco.
Wednesday noon tin- poised and
cautious diplomat conducted an in
formal and on-the-record discus- j
sion cf his country's policies with
a small group of faculty and stu
dents before being rushed hack to
(be City for more public appear
ances.
The question of comparing Tito's
communism with Russia's was quick
ly parried by the soft-voiced but
firm ambassador.
1 "Russia lias Communism; we j

| bare demon atio socialism. Social
ism must be democratic if it is to
cvist. Wo have no separate rights
i for the state. While Russia's gov
ernment growing stronger and
\ stronger, we are trying to weaken
ours. Russia's collective farms be
long to the state, ours to the
peasants."
Dr. Bebler grew ironic when con
sidering the Trieste question now
j being debated in London by French,
| British, U.S., an*! Italian, but not,
! Yugoslavian, representatives.
The shock to public opinion in
bis count fy, lie implied, because of
the exclusion of Yugoslavian dele-
Kates from these conferences, whs
bound 4«» weaken their friendship
for the west, at least temporarily.
Tito's ambassador reported great
j progress in the industrialization of
his country ami in the collectiviza
tion of the land, policies which are.
; lie said, being accepted more and
I more widely by the peasants, despite
j their natural conservatism and
j "slowness."
The former Security Council
member expressed great faith in
the United Nations. His hopes were
based, lie said, 011 the growing
solidarity of the West, and on the
failure of Russian attempts to in-
J ducc Western governments into

separate and false peace | acts,
such as, for example, recent Ger
man treaty offers.
Moreover, he believes, every year
] the prospects for peace arc improv

ing. He expressed great concern for
continued U.S. participation in Eu
ropean affairs, hoping that the com
ing elections won't hinder our mu
tual security pact obligations.
