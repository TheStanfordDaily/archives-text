### 
WASHINGTON, April 10 (UP)—The Senate gave its elections
subcommittee a unanimous go-ahead today to continue its investi
gation of Son. Joseph R. McCarthy, but the senator and his fiiends
belittled the significance of the action.
The action was taken by a vote of 60 to 0 after the Wisconsin

♦Republican formally demanded a

similar investigation of Sen. William
Benton, wealthy Connecticut Demo
crat who sparked the investigation
of McCarthy.
McCarthy questioned Benton's
campaign spending, his activities an
publisher of the Encyclopedia Brit-
I tanica and his work as one-time as
sistant secretary of state
Beuion denied most of McCar
thy':: allegations »nd asserted the
Wisconsin Republican's charges
have already started a "blackmail"
j campaign against him and others
McCarthy linked his resolution to
his two-year-old campaign to prove
the state department i., infested with
communists and red sympathizers.
The resolution, referring to Ben
ton's state department, assignment,
declared:
"A number of individuals named
by Senator McCarthy as either
communists, fellow travelers or
dupes of the Kremlin were hired
or retained in office by Senator
Benton."
McCarthy said he had absolutely
no confidence" in democratic mem
bers of the subcommittee. But he
asserted it would be "grossly im
proper" to call off the investigation
now and demanded that the group
investigate Benton as vigorously
it has eyed his record.
When he asserted today ho has
"absolutely no confidence" in the
group's democratic members, sen
»te Democratic leader Ernest W
McFarland of Arizona retorted,
"I've never heard so serious a
charge made against the member
ship of any committee in my time
here"
The session was marked by acid
debate, during which Sen. A. S.
(Mike) Monroney (D-Okla.) labelled
the Wisconsin Republican's charges
against the subcommittee a "deliber
ate smear."
The senate rejected a petition to
discharge the elections subcommittee
from its study of McCarthy, lire
rules committee asked for this action
as a vote of confidence in the in
vestigation. But McCarthy and his
supporters also called for rejection
of the discharge petition
