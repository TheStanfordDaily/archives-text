# What's Wrong With Cardinals?
## 
### 
Cardinals heaved a sigh of relief this week
when Ihey learned that "Back to the Farm" ac
tivities would be pushed up another two weeks
because of inteiference with Good Friday. This
student organization, second in importance to
Excom with jurisdiction over ail all-campus ac
tivities, had forgotten they had scheduled
"Back to the Farm" for this Thursday and Fli
rt ay. (They happened to be reminded of this
Ly a Daily reporter last Tuesday, who asked
about plans for the corning weekend.)
11 the Public Exercises Committee had not
asked Cardinals lo cancel Thursday's and Fri
day's activities, they would have had less than
cise week to prepare for "Back to the Farm."
/•nd this, as Cardinals knows, is not enough.
Unfortunately the above incident, which
could be passed oil as trivial in itself, is typi
cal of the lack of organization within Cardi
nals this year.
The loot of disorganization can be easily
traced to Cardinals' weekly meetings. Usually
no more than two thirds of the members ap
pear, and those that do are preoccupied with
limiting, doing their "homework, or reading pe
riodicals. Much time is spent on discussions
which seldom lead to any constructive plans.
It is no wonder, then, that Cardinals forgot
"Back to the Farm."
These disorganized meetings are directly re
sponsible for the confusion that han surrounded

other all-campus events under the thumb o!
Cardinals. During the last month of winter
quarter Cardinals started discussing a charity
ball which would climax Con Home Week.
With the "help" ol an equally ill-planned lIR
conference which was to occur the same week
end, and confusion among the eating clubs
which were to sponser tlie dance, the charity
ball is still the most talked-about, but as yet
nebulous, event before Cardinals.
In individual eilorl the members ol Cardi
nals seem to be sincerely interested in plan
ning successful all-campus events, and lor
this purpose most ol the members have put
in a great deal ol lime, energy, and work.
But the work of individual members is often
wasted when the group as a whole is un-co ordi
nated, and disorganized meetings throw any
plans into confusion.
What Cardinals needs is more forceful lead
ership and a little attention lo organization in
planning its activities. And there is no reason
why they can't have both.
With two weeks to work on "Back to the
rarm," Cardinals has sufficient time lo make
this traditional event a big success. And by
evidencing the leadership and organization
they've been hiding up to now, Cardinals can
expect Con Home Week and their other
events to be as successful as they have been
in the past.—Sue Goodstein

tivities would be pushed up another two weeks
because of inteiference with Good Friday. This
student organization, second in importance to
Excom with jurisdiction over ail all-campus ac
tivities, had forgotten they had scheduled
"Back to the Farm" for this Thursday and Fli
rt ay. (They happened to be reminded of this
Ly a Daily reporter last Tuesday, who asked
about plans for the corning weekend.)
11 the Public Exercises Committee had not
asked Cardinals lo cancel Thursday's and Fri
day's activities, they would have had less than
cise week to prepare for "Back to the Farm."
/•nd this, as Cardinals knows, is not enough.
Unfortunately the above incident, which
could be passed oil as trivial in itself, is typi
cal of the lack of organization within Cardi
nals this year.
The loot of disorganization can be easily
traced to Cardinals' weekly meetings. Usually
no more than two thirds of the members ap
pear, and those that do are preoccupied with
limiting, doing their "homework, or reading pe
riodicals. Much time is spent on discussions
which seldom lead to any constructive plans.
It is no wonder, then, that Cardinals forgot
"Back to the Farm."
These disorganized meetings are directly re
sponsible for the confusion that han surrounded

other all-campus events under the thumb o!
Cardinals. During the last month of winter
quarter Cardinals started discussing a charity
ball which would climax Con Home Week.
With the "help" ol an equally ill-planned lIR
conference which was to occur the same week
end, and confusion among the eating clubs
which were to sponser tlie dance, the charity
ball is still the most talked-about, but as yet
nebulous, event before Cardinals.
In individual eilorl the members ol Cardi
nals seem to be sincerely interested in plan
ning successful all-campus events, and lor
this purpose most ol the members have put
in a great deal ol lime, energy, and work.
But the work of individual members is often
wasted when the group as a whole is un-co ordi
nated, and disorganized meetings throw any
plans into confusion.
What Cardinals needs is more forceful lead
ership and a little attention lo organization in
planning its activities. And there is no reason
why they can't have both.
With two weeks to work on "Back to the
rarm," Cardinals has sufficient time lo make
this traditional event a big success. And by
evidencing the leadership and organization
they've been hiding up to now, Cardinals can
expect Con Home Week and their other
events to be as successful as they have been
in the past.—Sue Goodstein
