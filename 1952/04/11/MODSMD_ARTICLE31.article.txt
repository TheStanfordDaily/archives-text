# BULL SESSION
## Good-bye 'Hello' Day 
### PETE GROTHE 
y j
A grand Stanford tradition has fallen with a re
sounding thud.
And I, for one, am happy.
In two weeks is Back to the Farm Week, or at least
what's left of it. It used to last all week. Now, it's
been dehydrated to three days. Among the "days"
that have received the axe is "Hello Day."

And T, for one, am happy.
For the benefit of the freshmen,
"Hello Day" was supposed to be
the day of friendly faces, loud
hello's, arid glad handshakes. It
wo ! a good idea that never panned
out. It was dropped.
And I, for one, am happy.
The reason I am happy is be
muse I had an unpleasant wrestle
wilh Hello Day last year. It said
in the Daily in bold, black, print
that everyone was supposed to

say hello to everyone else on Quad, whether he knew
him or not. And so, to the first person that I spotted,
I shouted, ' Hello!"
No ar. He had been swimming in Lake Lag
the dip- ». j«.a, and he was still trying to pick the
vv. Eds out of his mouth.
"Hello," I tried again to someone else.

"Shadup!" he ofTered.
"What''" I whatted. "Don't you know that this is
Hello Day, the day of cherry hello's and friendly
faces?"
"Shadup," he repeated. "My girl gave me my pin
back, I just flunked my midterm, my new cadillac
r racked up yesterday, and you expect me to say
"hello" to any joker who speaks to me on Quad?"
"The third time's the charm," I said to myself as
I greeted a hoy passing the Cellar.
"Whatsamatter, you running for office or surnpin?"
he spat back.
This was getting discouraging. I sal down 011 Ihe
Ed building steps between two poly sci professors
who were arguing whether Taft or Mac Arthur was
worse. Maybe I bad the wrong approach. Maybe
I should try something new. A girl was approach
ing 011 the horizon. I Mew the dust oIT my shoes,
stood lip, and manufactured a smile that would eat
a banana sideways.
"Hello," I began simply enough. "You look like
Helen Brown."
"That's nothing," she replied, "I look worse in red."
Ten more people ignored my hello's; the 11th re
sponded, then excused himself because he thought
that I was someone he knew.
