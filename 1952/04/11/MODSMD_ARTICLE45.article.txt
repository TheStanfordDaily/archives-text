V/ould you care to walk through the doors of an Italian palace?
You can at the Stanford Art Gallery.
The Thomas Welton Stanford Art Gallery, built by the brother
of Leland Stanford, is a modestly inconspicuous building next door
to the Main Library. It consists actually of four galleries, the

larger front ones being used for
traveling exhibits, the two hack
ones for the permanent exhibit, the
Mortimer C. Leventritt Collection.
This collection was donated in
1941 by a graduate of the class of
who devoted many years ol
his life to assembling art objects in
Europe, China, and Japan. Because
of the smallness of the museum
(which was further intensified
| when the architecture department
usurped one of the rooms to use as
a drafting room) the whole of the
collection cannot be .shown. On
exhibit this year are the Chinese
pieces and a group of eighteenth -
j century Italian and French pieces.
The Chinese collection is a
j small, well-chosen one, ranging
in time from the ceremonial ves
; sels of the Cluiu dynasty, 1122
8.C.. to fairly recent vases and
I platcware. One can trace, in its
j simplest form, thi development
! of the pottery, the first crude Itut
j lovely earthenware pieces, the
| experimentation with glazes, the
addition, first of blue, then <»112
other colors to the traditional
green and yellow, and, finally,
i the real porcelain for which
| China is so famous.
The 'Fang horse, which is be-
I lieved to be one of the finest of it;,
I kind, is one of the pieces taken
I from the tombs of wealthy noble-
J men. Buried in these tombs were
| representations of Chinese wealth,
! such as their animals and dancing
j girls (this was after they tired of
I killing the animals ar.d dancing
j girls so that they might actually ac
; company their lords in death). It is
from these tombs that much of the
most beautiful Chinese sculpture
comes.
Besides the permanent exhibits
j the gallery has three temporary
| exhibits. The larger front gallery
is used for traveling exhibits
which are changed every three
weeks. Ihese exhibits are select
ed from catalogues of various or
ganizations by Mrs. Helen Cross,
I associate director of the gallery.
I . • i
j Mrs. Cross, in selecting these ex
j hibits, tries to give the students
1 as wide a variety of techniques
! and periods of art as is possible.
For instance, on exhibit now is a
group of pictures entitled "Que
bec Painting Today."
Mrs. Cross selects, along with this
exhibit, a running exhibit of ex
cellent prints, various one - man
.shows by Stanford graduates, ine
good photography show r,nd one
architectural show per year. The
exhibit which, every year, creates
the most in interest is the Stanford
Student Show which will be held
this year around June 1.
