# Crucial Games For Card Nine
## Card Trio Out For UCLA, USC 
### PETE GROTHE 
Three key Stanford baseballers,
Chuck Es;;egian, Dick Cole, and Art
Abrahamson, will watch Stanford's
most crucial baseball weekend from
the bench.
The Indians tie into uCLA at
3:15 p.m. today and then lock horns
with the USC Trojans at 1:30 p.m.
tomorrow in a doubleheader. All
three games take place in the fa
miliar surroundings of the Sunken
Diamond.
E .segian, the left fielder who set
a record a few weeks ago by blast-

ing two homers out of the Sunken
Diamond in one game, is favoring a
bad knee and is a very doubtful
starter.
Aln-ahainson to Coac-li Third
Co-captain Art Abrahamson also
wrecked a knee, sliding into base,
and he'll be restricted to the first

I base coaching box.
Dick Cole, center Holder from
! Yakima, has an ankle that looks
like a balloon. However, it wasn't
[ hurt sliding into base; it was hurt
I skiing, much to Everett Dean's di»
| pleasure.
Rich Scromaglia, the hustling
J freshman infielder, has been doing
j admirably at second in place o!
Abraham on and Hal Skillman,
I Dave Rosenkrantz or Owen Powell
will fill in at the other two spots.
UCLA, which dropped the In
dians twice two weeks ago, will
j start Forrest Maier on the mound.
Other starters, in the order they
will bat, are: Hal Crow, center lield;
j Leo Alarid, shortstop; Ted Narleski,
j third base; John Matulich, first
base; Ron Gerst, left field; Dick
Hansen, second base; A 1 Bates,
right field: and Ken Moate, catcher.
Best College Coach
On Saturday, Coach Rod De
deaux, who is called by many the
best college baseball coach in the
country, will herd his CIBA-lead
ing Trojans to town. USC has three
hurling aces on whom to call: Tom
Lovrich, Dave Cesca, and Jack
Schlarb. Two cf these will be used.
Cesca and Schlarb have both won
four and lost one, and Lovrich has
six triumphs without a defeat to
his credit.
Lou Bishara is the top Trojan
sticker with a .408 average, while
dangerous A 1 Lamont leads the club
in homers with six. The Charnofsky
brothers, Ray and Stan, form the
league's best double-play combina
tion at short and second.
Rog Osenbaugh will get the call
for Stanford against the Bruins,
while Bob Murphy and Joe Che?,
will toe the mound in the Saturday
twin bill.
