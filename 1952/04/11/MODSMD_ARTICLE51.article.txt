# It's Only Spring, But Pappy's Crying
## 
### 
Pappy Waldorf, that win-happy
coach of the California Bears, has
glanced at the surrounding schools
in the Pacific Coast Conference and
has labeled Stanford to be right up
there with the best come fall.
Taking a moment from running
his charges through spring drills,
Rippy opined, "It's going to he a
real dog fight. UCLA will he rough
er than ever next season. I really

fear those Bruins, and look what
they did to us lust year.
"USC and Washington State will
be hard to handle. Oregon has a
good young club. And don't over
look Oregon State. And with Don
Heinrich back, Washington will be
dangerous.
'"Now almost no one gives Stan
ford a chance, hut I disagree I
know the tmlians wiii he right
up there."
