# Dancers Whirl at Carnival
## 
### 

SWING YOUR PARTNER—It was Carnival Time in the Women's Gym on Saturday night, as party
goers danced and square-danced, played ping-pong and bridge, and swam in the Women's Gym
pool. Each Co-Rec club ran a carnival booth exhibiting their quarter's activities and explaining
their functions. The Carnival, replaced this year's Spring Reg Dancc, and may become an annual
event. —Daily photo by Herb Smith
