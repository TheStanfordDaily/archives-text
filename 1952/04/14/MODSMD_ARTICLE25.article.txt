# Ike—The Man Versus the Myth
## 
### 
General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower,
the man who successfully, often brilliantly, led
allied forces to success in Europe in World War
11, and the nnn who returned to active military
status in calmer times to protect the peace, is
returning to the U.S.
Behind him is a successfully established
NATO —a well-laid foundation for patterns of
defense in Europe. Before him is a strong pos
sibility that he will be nominated as the Re
publican presidential standard bearer for 1952.
Announcement of his return was generally
cheered, for varying reasons, among men of
both parties in the U.S. But his indication that
he will not campaign until and unless lie is
nominated should disappoint both Republicans
aud .Democrats.
Unfortunately, the man Eisenhower has been
nearly eclipsed by the myth Eisenhower. His
large votes in the presidential primaries, we
cannot help but feel, have been largely ex
pressions of faith in the myth, not expressions
of support for his policies. His support has
been astonishing, unprecedented for a candi
date about whom so little is known.
The oeneral is not a completely unknown
quantii/. That he favors containment of Com
munism and a strong, united defense towaid
that end is known. That he is an able adminis
trator, capable of providing vigorous leader
ship and choosing able subordinates he has
demonstrated. His foreign policy in the Far
East, his domestic attitudes, his general philos
ophy of government, however, he has at best
only hinted at. On specific issues, he has been
silent, and indicates he will remain so.
It is not Inconceivable that the general could
be norrii. J without uttering hardly a word on
specific policies. Strength now for a silent Ike

is astounding.
His support is a heterogenous support. Often
it is not based on reason. He has the support
of many liberal Republicans, but Ike's domestic
policies are likely to be conservative. He is
backed often more by the anti-Taft than the pro-
Eisenhower. Many Republicans, 20 years out
of the government saddle, feel that Ike, the very
symbol of victory, is potentially more a winner
than Bob Taft, whom they feel is colorless in
comparison. And Ike's cjrass-root support is
based more on hysteria and hero-worship than
logical conviction.
Until and unless Ike takes a stand on the
issues facing us today, we cannot with good
intellectual conscience "like Ike." Rather we
can like him, we can like his personal gualities,
his wide, infectious grin, and we can admire
his record, but we cannot support him or elect
a president on personality judgments alone.
There are those Eisenhower supporters who
say the men behind him are known guantities—
that a vote for Ike is a vote for the liberalism
which many of his supporters champion. The
bandwagon glitters. But we cannot in good con
science let Paul Hoffman or Senator Lodge or
anyone else make up our minds for us.
Ike owes it to his party and to the American
people to take clear-cut stands on the issues we
face.
We would be disappointed to see an Eisen
hower nomination based on the Eisenhower
myth. And we would be egually disappointed
to see Taft nominated through an Ike default,
through the general's refusal to specifically
make known his views.
In a democratic society, the electorate must
face a real choice. Statements of policy on
Eisenhower's part can help define that choice.

of many liberal Republicans, but Ike's domestic
policies are likely to be conservative. He is
backed often more by the anti-Taft than the pro-
Eisenhower. Many Republicans, 20 years out
of the government saddle, feel that Ike, the very
symbol of victory, is potentially more a winner
than Bob Taft, whom they feel is colorless in
comparison. And Ike's cjrass-root support is
based more on hysteria and hero-worship than
logical conviction.
Until and unless Ike takes a stand on the
issues facing us today, we cannot with good
intellectual conscience "like Ike." Rather we
can like him, we can like his personal gualities,
his wide, infectious grin, and we can admire
his record, but we cannot support him or elect
a president on personality judgments alone.
There are those Eisenhower supporters who
say the men behind him are known guantities—
that a vote for Ike is a vote for the liberalism
which many of his supporters champion. The
bandwagon glitters. But we cannot in good con
science let Paul Hoffman or Senator Lodge or
anyone else make up our minds for us.
Ike owes it to his party and to the American
people to take clear-cut stands on the issues we
face.
We would be disappointed to see an Eisen
hower nomination based on the Eisenhower
myth. And we would be egually disappointed
to see Taft nominated through an Ike default,
through the general's refusal to specifically
make known his views.
In a democratic society, the electorate must
face a real choice. Statements of policy on
Eisenhower's part can help define that choice.
General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower,
the man who successfully, often brilliantly, led
allied forces to success in Europe in World War
11, and the nnn who returned to active military
status in calmer times to protect the peace, is
returning to the U.S.
Behind him is a successfully established
NATO —a well-laid foundation for patterns of
defense in Europe. Before him is a strong pos
sibility that he will be nominated as the Re
publican presidential standard bearer for 1952.
Announcement of his return was generally
cheered, for varying reasons, among men of
both parties in the U.S. But his indication that
he will not campaign until and unless lie is
nominated should disappoint both Republicans
aud .Democrats.
Unfortunately, the man Eisenhower has been
nearly eclipsed by the myth Eisenhower. His
large votes in the presidential primaries, we
cannot help but feel, have been largely ex
pressions of faith in the myth, not expressions
of support for his policies. His support has
been astonishing, unprecedented for a candi
date about whom so little is known.
The oeneral is not a completely unknown
quantii/. That he favors containment of Com
munism and a strong, united defense towaid
that end is known. That he is an able adminis
trator, capable of providing vigorous leader
ship and choosing able subordinates he has
demonstrated. His foreign policy in the Far
East, his domestic attitudes, his general philos
ophy of government, however, he has at best
only hinted at. On specific issues, he has been
silent, and indicates he will remain so.
It is not Inconceivable that the general could
be norrii. J without uttering hardly a word on
specific policies. Strength now for a silent Ike

is astounding.
His support is a heterogenous support. Often
it is not based on reason. He has the support
of many liberal Republicans, but Ike's domestic
policies are likely to be conservative. He is
backed often more by the anti-Taft than the pro-
Eisenhower. Many Republicans, 20 years out
