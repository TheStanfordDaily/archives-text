### DICK McLEAN 
It's springtime and it's raining. Wlv.-.t luck! T| just
isn't fair. We've had more than our share of rain
during fall and winter quarters. But does the weather
man know that? No sir.
If it weren't for the fact that this is called spring
quarter and the calendar says the same, we'd have a
hard time telling. But there are a lew signs of spring
other than sunshine. If you were Kip Van Winkle
waking after a 20-year nap and wanted to know what
season this was, here's how you'd know:

1) The" tans. It seems that
everyone who owns a face has a
tans on it. For a quick ten clays
the sun peeked through a gap in
ihe clouds and everyone scamp
ered outside to cook themselves.
Tans come in sizes and degrees
like broiled steaks. Medium-rare
tans are acquired by golfing and
boating. This type of tan is char
acterized by a braized scarlet hue
that ends at the collar and sleeves.
(Like an inside cut of roast beef.

Medium tans are usually copper in color and come
from skiing. You can always tell someone who's
spent some time on the slopes. The white goggle
marks around his eyes give him a perpetually startled
lAok. (Like two boiled potatoes on top of an under
done plank steak.)
The welldone tans are gravy colored and cover
the person from head to foot. (Well, almost from
head to foot.) 'Ihese belong to (lie swimmers and
Sun bathers. A well-done tan is u work of art re
quiring skill and patience. The principle is to In-own
the skin without peeling it. This is accomplished
by oiling the llesh well and roasting it under a slow
snn for several days being careful to turn and haste
il periodically. Garnished with a dash of zinc ovide
and lopped off with a pinch of coco butter, a well
done tan goes well on the most delicate of stomachs.

The sad thing about tans is that they fade if they're
not replenished. Another week of rain and everyone
will have to start all over again. Every time the sun
even hints at shining, people grab the sun glasses
and oil only to be met by a cold gust of rain. And
all the while their skin grows lighter and lighter.
It's kind of sad.
2) The dieting. It seems that everyone who's got
a body wants it smaller. In the drab winter—the
time of raincoats and heavy clothes—nobody's worried
about what they'll look like in a swimming suit.
Everyone enjoyed the garlic French bread and the
mashed potatoes and the hot fudge sundaes and the
other calorie loaded foods. But with Ihe sun and the
spring and the shedding of winter garments comes
the realization, ''You can look like a snowman in the
wintertime but you've got to be a gazelle on the
beach."'
Bicycle riding is the latest outdoor sport among
the girls. The other exercise is the placing of the
hands against the dinner table and exerting a firm
pressure in a backward direction. The mounds of
mashed potatoes shimmer like virgin snow but no
one touches them. The chocolate smothered deserts
are melted by the burning eyes of the starving.
In the University dining halls the naturally thin
people are eating like kings. It's a strange sight to
see a sparrow of a girl eating half the desserts at a
table while the rest of the table glares at her in
envy and longing. "I just can't seem to gain weight,"
she chirps merrily between chomps. (She can't un
derstand it when she discovers ground glass in the
bottom of her seventh dessert.)
Al the Cellar you'll see a girl snatch up a U-NO
bar, tear ofi the wrapper, and wolf it down mutter
ing, "I don't care. I don't care . . ."
So il you were Rip Van Winkle and did come back
after twenty years and saw a group of brightly clad
people with tan faces and hungry eyes walking around
sadly in the rain, you'd know. It's spring all right.

isn't fair. We've had more than our share of rain
during fall and winter quarters. But does the weather
man know that? No sir.
If it weren't for the fact that this is called spring
quarter and the calendar says the same, we'd have a
hard time telling. But there are a lew signs of spring
other than sunshine. If you were Kip Van Winkle
waking after a 20-year nap and wanted to know what
season this was, here's how you'd know:

1) The" tans. It seems that
everyone who owns a face has a
tans on it. For a quick ten clays
the sun peeked through a gap in
ihe clouds and everyone scamp
ered outside to cook themselves.
Tans come in sizes and degrees
like broiled steaks. Medium-rare
tans are acquired by golfing and
boating. This type of tan is char
acterized by a braized scarlet hue
that ends at the collar and sleeves.
(Like an inside cut of roast beef.

Medium tans are usually copper in color and come
from skiing. You can always tell someone who's
spent some time on the slopes. The white goggle
marks around his eyes give him a perpetually startled
lAok. (Like two boiled potatoes on top of an under
done plank steak.)
The welldone tans are gravy colored and cover
the person from head to foot. (Well, almost from
head to foot.) 'Ihese belong to (lie swimmers and
Sun bathers. A well-done tan is u work of art re
quiring skill and patience. The principle is to In-own
the skin without peeling it. This is accomplished
by oiling the llesh well and roasting it under a slow
snn for several days being careful to turn and haste
il periodically. Garnished with a dash of zinc ovide
and lopped off with a pinch of coco butter, a well
done tan goes well on the most delicate of stomachs.

The sad thing about tans is that they fade if they're
not replenished. Another week of rain and everyone
will have to start all over again. Every time the sun
even hints at shining, people grab the sun glasses
and oil only to be met by a cold gust of rain. And
all the while their skin grows lighter and lighter.
It's kind of sad.
2) The dieting. It seems that everyone who's got
a body wants it smaller. In the drab winter—the
time of raincoats and heavy clothes—nobody's worried
about what they'll look like in a swimming suit.
Everyone enjoyed the garlic French bread and the
mashed potatoes and the hot fudge sundaes and the
other calorie loaded foods. But with Ihe sun and the
spring and the shedding of winter garments comes
the realization, ''You can look like a snowman in the
wintertime but you've got to be a gazelle on the
beach."'
Bicycle riding is the latest outdoor sport among
the girls. The other exercise is the placing of the
hands against the dinner table and exerting a firm
pressure in a backward direction. The mounds of
mashed potatoes shimmer like virgin snow but no
one touches them. The chocolate smothered deserts
are melted by the burning eyes of the starving.
In the University dining halls the naturally thin
people are eating like kings. It's a strange sight to
see a sparrow of a girl eating half the desserts at a
table while the rest of the table glares at her in
envy and longing. "I just can't seem to gain weight,"
she chirps merrily between chomps. (She can't un
derstand it when she discovers ground glass in the
bottom of her seventh dessert.)
Al the Cellar you'll see a girl snatch up a U-NO
bar, tear ofi the wrapper, and wolf it down mutter
ing, "I don't care. I don't care . . ."
So il you were Rip Van Winkle and did come back
after twenty years and saw a group of brightly clad
people with tan faces and hungry eyes walking around
sadly in the rain, you'd know. It's spring all right.

It's springtime and it's raining. Wlv.-.t luck! T| just
