# Papa' Takes Final Bows

### RON ROSEN 
With the final curtain call of
last Saturday night's concert by
the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra, the music lovers of
the Bay Area bade good-bye to
the orchestra's beloved conduc
tor, Pierre Monteux, in a farewell
that Vv ill long be remembered.
After 17 years with this orchestra,
Monteux is retiring from the post
of permanent conductor, but like so
many musicians who have clone so,
he is not retiring from music. It
would lie clillieult, if not impossible,
for him to give up music after an
association with it which has lasted
almost as long as Maitre Monteux's
77 years.
Monteux started as a violist in the
Opera - Comicjue after winning a
first prize in that instrument at the
Paris Con i .lory in 189(5.
His first, important conducting
post was with the Concerts Berlioz.
Shortly afterward, in 1916, he came
to the United Stated for the first
time with the DiaghilefT Ballet
Huss;e. It is with the latter group
that Monteux helped make history.
Ho conductcd the world premieres
of Stravinsky's "Petrouchka," "Ros
signol," and "Rite of Spring," and
Debussy's "Jeux."
The Symphony Board in Boston
was so impressed with the great

French conductor that he was
named permanent conductor there,
and remained for six seasons (1919-
24) which are still remembered for
their brilliance.
After conducting the Amsterdam
Concertgebouw for three years,
"Papa"' Pierre came to San Fran
| cisco in 1935 lo reorganize and con
duct the tottering S.F. Symphony.
Monteux's retirement is no)
only San Francisco's loss, but it is

I also Stanford's as well. Ilis year
ly visits on campus liavc brought
lis the finest in musical programs.
San Francisco not only loses a
great musician, hut. also a great man
whose sparkling wit and gentle
mariner have endeared him to all.
"Papa has always been of service
to young musicians and composers
who need a "break," and has prob
ably conducted more contemporary
works on his programs than any
other maestro.
Monteux's worth as a conductor
was summed up in a review of his
recent performances in Boston. Mu
sical America said, "Pierre Mon
teux, one of the greatest technical
masters among contemporary con
ductors, led the Boston Symphony
from 1919 to 1924. After hearing
this concert, I could well believe
the legends of virtuosity to which
he brought it in those years. Mr.
Monteux handles an orchestra the
way Jascha Heifetz handles a vio
lin. He is a marvelous antidote for
the clenched fist, and tremulous fin
ger-tip schools of conducting."
ft is such a man that we, in
this area, lose. And while we
wish Papa Monteux the happiest
years ahead at his home in New
Kngland, we sincerely hope that
he will return from time to time
as guest conductor of his San

PIERRE MONTEUX
—A farewell In rem?ml>er
With the final curtain call of
last Saturday night's concert by
the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra, the music lovers of
the Bay Area bade good-bye to
the orchestra's beloved conduc
tor, Pierre Monteux, in a farewell
that Vv ill long be remembered.
After 17 years with this orchestra,
Monteux is retiring from the post
of permanent conductor, but like so
many musicians who have clone so,
he is not retiring from music. It
would lie clillieult, if not impossible,
for him to give up music after an
association with it which has lasted
almost as long as Maitre Monteux's
77 years.
Monteux started as a violist in the
Opera - Comicjue after winning a
first prize in that instrument at the
Paris Con i .lory in 189(5.
His first, important conducting
post was with the Concerts Berlioz.
Shortly afterward, in 1916, he came
to the United Stated for the first
time with the DiaghilefT Ballet
Huss;e. It is with the latter group
that Monteux helped make history.
Ho conductcd the world premieres
of Stravinsky's "Petrouchka," "Ros
signol," and "Rite of Spring," and
Debussy's "Jeux."
The Symphony Board in Boston
was so impressed with the great

French conductor that he was
named permanent conductor there,
and remained for six seasons (1919-
24) which are still remembered for
their brilliance.
After conducting the Amsterdam
Concertgebouw for three years,
"Papa"' Pierre came to San Fran
| cisco in 1935 lo reorganize and con
duct the tottering S.F. Symphony.
Monteux's retirement is no)
only San Francisco's loss, but it is

I also Stanford's as well. Ilis year
ly visits on campus liavc brought
lis the finest in musical programs.
San Francisco not only loses a
great musician, hut. also a great man
whose sparkling wit and gentle
mariner have endeared him to all.
"Papa has always been of service
to young musicians and composers
who need a "break," and has prob
ably conducted more contemporary
works on his programs than any
other maestro.
Monteux's worth as a conductor
was summed up in a review of his
recent performances in Boston. Mu
sical America said, "Pierre Mon
teux, one of the greatest technical
masters among contemporary con
ductors, led the Boston Symphony
from 1919 to 1924. After hearing
this concert, I could well believe
the legends of virtuosity to which
he brought it in those years. Mr.
Monteux handles an orchestra the
way Jascha Heifetz handles a vio
lin. He is a marvelous antidote for
the clenched fist, and tremulous fin
ger-tip schools of conducting."

this area, lose. And while we
wish Papa Monteux the happiest
years ahead at his home in New
