# All Spring Sports Are in Full Bloom on the Farm
## Joe Chez Throws One-Hit Shutout; Cards Win One, Lose Two League Tilts 
### PETE GROTHE 
Like the maid who tries to cover up a poorly made bed by putting the bedspread on neatly, Stan
ford's Joe Chez put the correct finishing touch on an otherwise disastrous weekend by fashioning
a one-hit masterpiece to put the crush on the Trojans, 2 to 0, last Saturday.
UCLA took the Card baseballers' measure, 10 to 8, in a slugfest last Friday. And the Trojans won
the first game Saturday, B to 4.
Going into the nightcap last Saturday, USC had gone 193 consecutive games without being shut

out. Chez, the amiable control ar
tist from Medford, Oregon, broke
that ,'kein.
Everett Dean's baseballers
scored tbeir two runs in the
fourth. Second baseman Kiel)
S« a freshman who's be
ginning to look Like an old pro
heal out an infield single. Then
Owen (Bruno) Powell, who has
a knack for getting base hits when
they count, banged a hit into cen
ter that Bob Hertel challenged
and fell all over himself trying to
field. It wus good for a triple, and
Scramaglia rolled home.
USC chucker Dave Cesca pur
posely passed Jack Shepard and
Chuck Essegian to load the bases
end then passed third baseman Ray
Swarts, this time not purposely, to
iorce in Powell.
In the first game, which the Tro
jans took, G to 4, Stanford's pitcher
Hob Murphy only gave up one
earned run, but he helped betray
his own cause by tiring two wild
pitches at crucial points in the
game.
The UC'LA heartbreaker on
Friday saw 27 base hits being
chalked up, including hree home
runs. Only 18 four-masters have
been hit in the history of the
Sunken Diamond, and Stanford's
answer to Ralph Kiner, Chuck
Essegian, rot two of them on Fri
day. He thereby duplicated a feat
that he had achieved earlier in
the year and became the first man
to hit four home runs out of the
Sunken Diamond.
The other homer was dealt out
by Bruin pitcher Verlin Crooks in
the eighth inning, and it was this
hit that clutched defeat out of the
hands of victory for the Cards.
The poker-faced Essegian got his
first home run in the fourth inning,
and the ball was still grwoing mus
cles as it soared over the 390-foot
mark in left field.
Then in the seventh, the In
dians had already tallied four
times to lead, 6 to 5. Essegian
came to bat and crashed another
homer over the 1)7(1 - foot mark

! with Shepard aboard.
Just as people were thinking
' about nominating Essegian for
President, the Bruins went to work
on Mike Acker, who relieved the
injured Rdg Osenbaugh. Five runs
wandered across the plate, and that
was the game.

YER OUT! —Versatile Jack Shepard filled in at first last Saturday
when Jim Agar hurt his hand. He looked good at the first sack
although he was disappointing at the plate. Stanford was able
only to take one out of their three weekend contests.

Like the maid who tries to cover up a poorly made bed by putting the bedspread on neatly, Stan
ford's Joe Chez put the correct finishing touch on an otherwise disastrous weekend by fashioning
a one-hit masterpiece to put the crush on the Trojans, 2 to 0, last Saturday.
UCLA took the Card baseballers' measure, 10 to 8, in a slugfest last Friday. And the Trojans won
the first game Saturday, B to 4.
Going into the nightcap last Saturday, USC had gone 193 consecutive games without being shut

out. Chez, the amiable control ar
tist from Medford, Oregon, broke
that ,'kein.
Everett Dean's baseballers
scored tbeir two runs in the
fourth. Second baseman Kiel)
S« a freshman who's be
ginning to look Like an old pro
heal out an infield single. Then
Owen (Bruno) Powell, who has
a knack for getting base hits when
they count, banged a hit into cen
ter that Bob Hertel challenged
and fell all over himself trying to
field. It wus good for a triple, and
Scramaglia rolled home.
USC chucker Dave Cesca pur
posely passed Jack Shepard and
Chuck Essegian to load the bases
end then passed third baseman Ray
Swarts, this time not purposely, to
iorce in Powell.
In the first game, which the Tro
jans took, G to 4, Stanford's pitcher
Hob Murphy only gave up one
earned run, but he helped betray
his own cause by tiring two wild
pitches at crucial points in the
game.
The UC'LA heartbreaker on
Friday saw 27 base hits being
chalked up, including hree home
runs. Only 18 four-masters have
been hit in the history of the
Sunken Diamond, and Stanford's
answer to Ralph Kiner, Chuck
Essegian, rot two of them on Fri
day. He thereby duplicated a feat
that he had achieved earlier in
the year and became the first man
to hit four home runs out of the
Sunken Diamond.
The other homer was dealt out
by Bruin pitcher Verlin Crooks in
the eighth inning, and it was this
hit that clutched defeat out of the
hands of victory for the Cards.
The poker-faced Essegian got his
first home run in the fourth inning,
and the ball was still grwoing mus
cles as it soared over the 390-foot
mark in left field.
Then in the seventh, the In
dians had already tallied four
times to lead, 6 to 5. Essegian
came to bat and crashed another
homer over the 1)7(1 - foot mark

! with Shepard aboard.
Just as people were thinking
' about nominating Essegian for
President, the Bruins went to work
on Mike Acker, who relieved the
injured Rdg Osenbaugh. Five runs
wandered across the plate, and that
was the game.

when Jim Agar hurt his hand. He looked good at the first sack
although he was disappointing at the plate. Stanford was able
only to take one out of their three weekend contests.

Like the maid who tries to cover up a poorly made bed by putting the bedspread on neatly, Stan
ford's Joe Chez put the correct finishing touch on an otherwise disastrous weekend by fashioning
a one-hit masterpiece to put the crush on the Trojans, 2 to 0, last Saturday.
UCLA took the Card baseballers' measure, 10 to 8, in a slugfest last Friday. And the Trojans won
the first game Saturday, B to 4.
Going into the nightcap last Saturday, USC had gone 193 consecutive games without being shut

out. Chez, the amiable control ar
tist from Medford, Oregon, broke
that ,'kein.
Everett Dean's baseballers
scored tbeir two runs in the
fourth. Second baseman Kiel)
S« a freshman who's be
ginning to look Like an old pro
heal out an infield single. Then
Owen (Bruno) Powell, who has
a knack for getting base hits when
they count, banged a hit into cen
ter that Bob Hertel challenged
and fell all over himself trying to
field. It wus good for a triple, and
Scramaglia rolled home.
USC chucker Dave Cesca pur
posely passed Jack Shepard and
Chuck Essegian to load the bases
end then passed third baseman Ray
Swarts, this time not purposely, to
iorce in Powell.
In the first game, which the Tro
jans took, G to 4, Stanford's pitcher
Hob Murphy only gave up one
earned run, but he helped betray
his own cause by tiring two wild
pitches at crucial points in the
game.
The UC'LA heartbreaker on
Friday saw 27 base hits being
chalked up, including hree home
runs. Only 18 four-masters have
been hit in the history of the
Sunken Diamond, and Stanford's
answer to Ralph Kiner, Chuck
Essegian, rot two of them on Fri
day. He thereby duplicated a feat
that he had achieved earlier in
the year and became the first man
to hit four home runs out of the
Sunken Diamond.
The other homer was dealt out
by Bruin pitcher Verlin Crooks in
the eighth inning, and it was this
hit that clutched defeat out of the
hands of victory for the Cards.
The poker-faced Essegian got his
first home run in the fourth inning,
and the ball was still grwoing mus
cles as it soared over the 390-foot
mark in left field.
Then in the seventh, the In
dians had already tallied four
times to lead, 6 to 5. Essegian
came to bat and crashed another
homer over the 1)7(1 - foot mark

! with Shepard aboard.
Just as people were thinking
' about nominating Essegian for
President, the Bruins went to work
on Mike Acker, who relieved the
injured Rdg Osenbaugh. Five runs
wandered across the plate, and that
was the game.

YER OUT! —Versatile Jack Shepard filled in at first last Saturday
when Jim Agar hurt his hand. He looked good at the first sack
although he was disappointing at the plate. Stanford was able
only to take one out of their three weekend contests.

Like the maid who tries to cover up a poorly made bed by putting the bedspread on neatly, Stan
ford's Joe Chez put the correct finishing touch on an otherwise disastrous weekend by fashioning
a one-hit masterpiece to put the crush on the Trojans, 2 to 0, last Saturday.
UCLA took the Card baseballers' measure, 10 to 8, in a slugfest last Friday. And the Trojans won
the first game Saturday, B to 4.
Going into the nightcap last Saturday, USC had gone 193 consecutive games without being shut

out. Chez, the amiable control ar
tist from Medford, Oregon, broke
that ,'kein.
Everett Dean's baseballers
scored tbeir two runs in the
fourth. Second baseman Kiel)
S« a freshman who's be
ginning to look Like an old pro
heal out an infield single. Then
Owen (Bruno) Powell, who has
a knack for getting base hits when
they count, banged a hit into cen
ter that Bob Hertel challenged
and fell all over himself trying to
field. It wus good for a triple, and
Scramaglia rolled home.
USC chucker Dave Cesca pur
posely passed Jack Shepard and
Chuck Essegian to load the bases
end then passed third baseman Ray
Swarts, this time not purposely, to
iorce in Powell.
In the first game, which the Tro
jans took, G to 4, Stanford's pitcher
Hob Murphy only gave up one
earned run, but he helped betray
his own cause by tiring two wild
pitches at crucial points in the
game.
The UC'LA heartbreaker on
Friday saw 27 base hits being
chalked up, including hree home
runs. Only 18 four-masters have
been hit in the history of the
Sunken Diamond, and Stanford's
answer to Ralph Kiner, Chuck
Essegian, rot two of them on Fri
day. He thereby duplicated a feat
that he had achieved earlier in
the year and became the first man
to hit four home runs out of the
Sunken Diamond.
The other homer was dealt out
by Bruin pitcher Verlin Crooks in
the eighth inning, and it was this
hit that clutched defeat out of the
hands of victory for the Cards.
The poker-faced Essegian got his
first home run in the fourth inning,
and the ball was still grwoing mus
cles as it soared over the 390-foot
mark in left field.
Then in the seventh, the In
dians had already tallied four
times to lead, 6 to 5. Essegian
came to bat and crashed another
homer over the 1)7(1 - foot mark

! with Shepard aboard.
Just as people were thinking
' about nominating Essegian for
President, the Bruins went to work
on Mike Acker, who relieved the
injured Rdg Osenbaugh. Five runs
wandered across the plate, and that
was the game.
