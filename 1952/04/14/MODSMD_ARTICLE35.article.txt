# Racqueteers Lose to Bears
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity net'ters were
topped by Cal Saturday afternoon
7 matches to 2.
The meet was closer than the
score indicates, however. Charlie
Hickox, Bob Sibert, and Art Fish
all had opportunities to win their
matches, but were unable to capi
talize on them. Also, George Gen
try was hampered by a painful in
jury to his arm.
The outstanding player of the day
was Indian Tom "Lucky" Lewyn.
who, displaying his best tennis of
the season, won both his singles
and doubles with an assist from
Gary Gray.
The JV netmen fared better
aaginst Cal. They reversed the sit
uation and beat the Blues 7 to 2.
