# Cal Drubs Rugbymen
## 
### 
Stanford's rugby team was drub
! bed 23 to 3 by Cal before a sparse
j crowd in gloomy Memorial Stadium
j last Saturday.
The one-two punch of Max How
ell and Les Richter led Cal's finest
i team to the slaughter. The mam-
I moth Richter booted 17 points while
Howell's punting and field-general
| ship were outstanding.
The Redshirts' lone tally came on
j Fletch Metten's 18-yard place-kick
1 in the second half.
Stanford closes out its season
next Saturday against UCLA in Los
Angeles. They should do better
j there.
