# The 						Stevens Are 'Versatile' Dramatic Duo at Stanford
## 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
"Versatile" is the word that
best describes Robin and Steve
Stevens, the brothers who are
director and technical director
respectively of the Spring Show,
"Finian's Rainbow."
Both of the boys have had a great
deal of experience to prepare them
i'or this tremendous job. Robin, a
speech and drama graduate from
San Diego State, plans to go into
directing "if the draft doesn't inter
fere."
In San Diego, Robin acted in
many plays, and directed the best

comedy in the 1950 San Diego State
College eontcst, and in 1951
switched to tragedy and again won
the contest. Robin conducted a di
recting experiment at San Diego—
staging the fir: t three - act play
given in arena style, the theater-in
the-round, a form rapidly growing
in popularity.
.'Much Experience
Robin acquired more directing
experience by working in the Pasa
dena Light Opera, and sang in the
San Diego Starlight Opera.
A playwright also, talented Robin
won the original one-act play writ
ing contest in the San Diego area.
When he graduated from San Diego
State, his fellow-students presented
him with a certificate of merit in
dramatic art.
Steve, his younger brother, is do
ing work in the Dramatic Depart
ment strictly as a hobby. He's ma
joring in physics, and plans to go
into research, after he graduates,
also "if the draft doesn't object."
In high school, Steve was a jack
of - all - trades on the stage, doing
both acting and technical work. In
Stanford. Steve has continued his
dramatic hobby, working and act
ing in many Farm shows. He has
sung in the Spring Show and opera
choruses and in the University

Chorus and the Spring Sing.
Technical Aspects
On the technical side, Steve has
worked on sound and lights in pre
vious Spring Shows and Gaieties.
IHe was affiliated with KZSU as
chief engineer, also. All these ac
tivities have fitted him well for his
present job as technical director.
Robin and Steve have worked to
gether on another project — their
electrical show, in which Robin did
the script and Steve the effects. The
show, called "Up and Atom," was
taken on the road last quarter to
many service camps. In it, Robin
used his knowledge of magic. He is
a member of the Society of Ameri
can Magicians and has given many
shows. Robin is also a member of
the honorary history and debating
fraternities, and, in San Diego, was
president of the Skull and Dagger
Club, an organization similar to our
j Ram's Head.
Asked about hobbies, both boys
j said that they didn't find much
| time for them, but, they admitted,
they both collect Walt Drney comic
books and hold the proud record of
not missing one issue. Robin in his
spare time also whips up original
sonqs with music and lyrics.
Tryouts Encouraged
In casting "Finian's Rainbow,"
Robin put up an encouraging note
for tryoutees: "If you can't act, we
have singing roles; if you can't sing,
we have acting roles; and if vou can
neither sing nor act, you can al
ways double as a tree-trunk."
Both Steve and Robin are en
thusiastic over the show chosen as
the Spring Show, and Steve holds
the opinion that it will be given a
better technical production than the
Broadway presentation.

Asked about hobbies, both boys
j said that they didn't find much

they both collect Walt Drney comic
books and hold the proud record of
not missing one issue. Robin in his
spare time also whips up original
sonqs with music and lyrics.
Tryouts Encouraged
In casting "Finian's Rainbow,"
Robin put up an encouraging note
for tryoutees: "If you can't act, we
have singing roles; if you can't sing,
we have acting roles; and if vou can
neither sing nor act, you can al

Both Steve and Robin are en
thusiastic over the show chosen as

"Versatile" is the word that
best describes Robin and Steve
Stevens, the brothers who are
director and technical director
respectively of the Spring Show,
"Finian's Rainbow."
Both of the boys have had a great
deal of experience to prepare them
i'or this tremendous job. Robin, a
speech and drama graduate from
San Diego State, plans to go into
directing "if the draft doesn't inter
fere."
In San Diego, Robin acted in
many plays, and directed the best

comedy in the 1950 San Diego State
College eontcst, and in 1951
switched to tragedy and again won
the contest. Robin conducted a di
recting experiment at San Diego—
staging the fir: t three - act play
given in arena style, the theater-in
the-round, a form rapidly growing
in popularity.
.'Much Experience
Robin acquired more directing
experience by working in the Pasa
dena Light Opera, and sang in the
San Diego Starlight Opera.
A playwright also, talented Robin
won the original one-act play writ
ing contest in the San Diego area.
When he graduated from San Diego
State, his fellow-students presented
him with a certificate of merit in
dramatic art.
Steve, his younger brother, is do
ing work in the Dramatic Depart
ment strictly as a hobby. He's ma
joring in physics, and plans to go
into research, after he graduates,
also "if the draft doesn't object."
In high school, Steve was a jack
of - all - trades on the stage, doing
both acting and technical work. In
Stanford. Steve has continued his
dramatic hobby, working and act
ing in many Farm shows. He has
sung in the Spring Show and opera
choruses and in the University

Chorus and the Spring Sing.
Technical Aspects
On the technical side, Steve has
worked on sound and lights in pre
vious Spring Shows and Gaieties.
IHe was affiliated with KZSU as
chief engineer, also. All these ac
tivities have fitted him well for his
present job as technical director.
Robin and Steve have worked to
gether on another project — their
electrical show, in which Robin did
the script and Steve the effects. The
show, called "Up and Atom," was
taken on the road last quarter to
many service camps. In it, Robin
used his knowledge of magic. He is
a member of the Society of Ameri
can Magicians and has given many
shows. Robin is also a member of
the honorary history and debating
fraternities, and, in San Diego, was
president of the Skull and Dagger
Club, an organization similar to our
