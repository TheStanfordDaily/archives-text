Plant development work is solid background
for a future in chemical engineering

Tl.<> work of production supervisors
at Du Pont, as discussed here last
month, is aimed at getting better
results from existing processes and
equipment.
In contrast, the job of plant de
velopment groups is to find ways to
improve methods and products, and
advise management when changes
should be made for economic or tech
nical reasons. Chemical engineers in
this work are responsible for lower
ing process costs, adapting the prod
uct, to new uses and improving prod
uct quality to obtain a larger share
of the existing market.
These duties provide an under
yfan ling of the fundamental aspects
of the business, as well as a broad
view of Company operations. The
training and experience a man gains
as a member of a plant development
group—often a first assignment at
Du Pont- is an excellent background
for any field he may move into later.
Conducting a development study
usually involves obtaining data from

laboratory, semi-works and plant
scale experiments, estimating profits
and investments, and consulting with
sales, research and production per
sonnel, also with auxiliary depart
ments such as Engineering, Chemi
cal and Purchasing, and with out
side authorities.
Here are typical problems solved
by plant development groups:

[ FOURTH OF A SERIES ]

1. Prompted by obsolescence and
wearing of equipment., experimental
studies and economic comparisons
were made on the entire process of
isolating dyes. Methods in use called
for crystallization, filter pressing and
tray drying. It was found that a
rotary vacuum filter with a continu
ous rotary steam tube dryer, air con
veyor and a dust collection system
reduced costs about $50,000 a year.
2. Production of sodium silicate was
to be increased substantially, but the
tank-type furnace at the heart of the
process proved a bottleneck. The
furnace design, including exit and

entry ports, was improved, anrl its
capacity enlarged at a small fraction
of the cost of a new furnace.
With the rapid growth of techno
logical improvements all over the
world and increasing competition,
plant development work assumes
greater and greater status. The Ch. E.
entering such a group at Du Font
finds a wealth of opportunity for his
skill and ingenuity.
