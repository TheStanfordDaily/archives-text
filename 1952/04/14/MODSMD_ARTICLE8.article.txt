## 
### DICK KLEIN Daily Sports Editor 
Tho Stanford track forces humbled their first PCC foe, clobber
ing UCLA by an 87 to 44 count in the Stadium last Saturday.
Nearly 2,500 fans saw the Indians take four sweeps in the field
events and two red-hot Cards break dual meet records.
Bob Mathias worked his way through five events, winning three

♦ firsts and a second, and scoring 18
I points. Several marks were his per
! sonaI bests and indicate that Bob
is rounding into shape for a solid
j attack on I he Olympic decathlon
} records, new scoring system or not
The Tulare Flash whipped the
platter an easy 165 ft. 4% in. for a
new UCLA dual meet record. His
| marks of :14.5 in the highs and
1:24.4 in the lows were excellent,
| especially the latter, considering
that Bob slowed up and coasted
home because of a muscle twinge in
the thigh.
In (he pole vault, Mathias
soared over the l.'i - fool height
and then took only one trv at
13 ft. (J in. and then withdrew.
He showed great improvement
here. As for the muscle ache,
Coach Jack Weiershauscr says
that it is only a temporary ail

next week. Boh Magee, who was
sidelined over the weekend, will
be ready for sprint duty in Los
Angeles.
Hie other meet record busted was
in the two-mile. Frosh Bob Reed
whirled around the eiqlil laps in
| the very creditable time of 9:31.3
and smashed the standard set in
1938 by Ed Burrows. The old mark
wa.s 9:32.7.
Bobby Simon got the whole show
; off to a good start by taking the
mile in an excellent 4:18, bis best
time. Done in the very cold weath
er, the time is even better after the
very slow half-mile fractions.
Other come - through performers
were John Wooley and Wally Mc-
Camant. Wooley held off the ter
rific stretch drive of McCamant,
who was meet captain, and wa.
clocked :iI 1:55.4. McCamant regis
tered ;i 1:5(i.2. Both were personal
| bests.
Only i:i (lie sj ints did the
Bruins show any scoring punch.
Itod Kichard found the Stadium
cinder: much <o his liking as he

two firsts. He did :09.7 in the
century and :2l.fi In the furlong.
