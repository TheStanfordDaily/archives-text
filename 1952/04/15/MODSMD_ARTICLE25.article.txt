# Student 'Scabs' and the Phone Strike
## 
### 
Steel, telephones, Western Electric, Grey
hound, telegraph within the past weeks weVe
seen labor-management deferences bring about
a disruption of all these industries by strike or
government intervention. However the prob
lem of the labor-management disagreement
was brought Koine to the Stanford campus yes
terday as the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph
local exchange manager admitted to a local
union charge that several students are acting as
strike-interim workersâ€”in the labor terminol
ogy, "scabs."
The "scab" question is a touchy one, one of
vital importance to both labor and manage
ment; and it is inseparable fiorn the question
<A the right lo strike.
The right of orqanized labor to stiike tor
its Tights in a system of free enterprise must
be granted, provided that such a stiike does
not severely disrupt the public economy or
is contrary to the public interest, but as the
right to stiike must be qualified by the public
interest, it must be remembered that without
the right to strike, labor's power is ineffective.
At the same time, we can't deny to rnanaqe
ment the preiogative to continue its work as
effectively as possible, during a strike, even if
this involves the hiring of interim workers or
"scabs."
Telephones are most certainly a public utility.
If the telephone service were completely para
lyzed, the results would be disastrous.
The [.ximary fact in the current phone strike,

though, is that the result has been nothing close
to complete disi uption of service. All local calls
are proceeding smoothly; and with the help of
supervisory personnel and some "scabs," the
phone company has been able to maintain 92
to 93 per cent regular service on long distance
calls.
This situation obviously affects the union's
striking power. While they are out on strike
and the phone company is able to maintain
normal service, the phone workers lose all the
around.
As the local union president, L. S. liaiber,
said yesterday, the fact that some students are
among those interim workers is not espe
cially important. The important fact is that
those students who are working simply to
eain some extra money, along with the other
"scabs," do not realize what their action
means to the phone workers.
Regardless ol the specific issues involved in
the current strike, we respect labor's right to
strike in this case, for its action has not para
lyzed the service of this public utility.
Correspondingly we respect the right of the
telephone company to carry on its service in
whatever fashion it can.
Each "scab" worker should then realize the
full import of his action. He is not just earninq
a little extra money fur himself, but he is af
fecting the livelihood cf all those workers on
strike who have great stakes on the outcome
ol this dispute. Walt Menninger
