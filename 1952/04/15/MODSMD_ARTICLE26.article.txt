# BULL SESSION
## Farewell to Paul 
### PETE GROTHE 
As you road this, a 1951 green Chevrolet is .speed
ing from Stanford to New York. And in that car is
jumbo Paul Zimmerman, late of Stanford and of the
Daily .sports staff. Zimbo is one of the most singularly
unique persons to matriculate to the Farm, and it
would : -'•> •-oper tor him to pass from our midst
without s orm of written tribute.

Paul ach.utted to 225 pounds,
but 230 would be more accurate.
Daring a Daily-Chappie football
#airie, Zimmerman smashed into
Nancy Ashbv, who was dressed
like a boy and who Zimbo thought
was a boy. Nancy is one of the
best girl football players on cam
pus, but the fact remains that
she possesses less than half of
Zimmerman's bulk and she was
Splattered all over the turf.

Nancy will testify that Zimbo is 251) pounds or more.
' Probably Paul's main claim to fame is that he was
Stanford's most successful practical joker since
Doodles Weaver. Harlan Stroud, the combination
Warren C 5. Wonka-Paul Bunyan was Zimbo's crea
tion.
With considerable embarrassment, I admit being
the gullible vehicle that Zimmerman used to cata
pult his creation to public attention.
The Harlan Stroud myth, which very conceivably
could have outshone Warren («. Wonka, began one
night several months ago in the lobby of the library.
Zimmerman was telling several others and myself
about a high school football player named Harlan
Stroud who was going to come to Stanford. Stroud,
Zimmerman exclaimed, would make McColl look
like a third string guard in comparison.
'iTiis Stroud, who attended Horace Mann High
School in New York, reached six foot, seven inches
into the stratosphere and weighed 270 pounds. And
not an ounce of fat. Not only that, Zimbo allowed,
but lie could do the 100 in 10.5. Furthermore, he
made All-Metropolitan three years in a row in New
York, playing fullback on offense and tackle on de
fense. Stroud bad good grades and his heart was
set on Stanford.
Zimmerman told all this with an intensely serious
face.
Gad, here was the greatest story since Nero fiddled
while Home burned. Here was real, stark drama.
Here was a guy who was possibly the world's best
athlete coming to Stanford.
The world must know about this, I reasoned. As

Stanford spoils correspondent for the Chronicle, I
thought that the Green should have this, so 1 dashed
to the phone to call Hill Leiser.
Leiser went wild at the oilier end of the line. He
sputtered off a few comments like "great, tremendous,
unbelievable" and rushed oft to tell Art Rosenbaum
about it. Next day, a big blurb about this Stroud
monster appeared in Rosenbaum's column.
Following that, articles appealed in the Palo Alto
Times anil the Daily. It was Chuck Taylor who in
formed the press that there was no one named Har
lan Stroud.
But Zimbo wasn't finished with Stroud yet. This
was too juicy a project to give up. He wrote a polite
note to Art Rosenbaum, saying:
I'm sorry about that mixup concerning Harlan
Stroud. Actually, he decided to go to Bucknell since
Stanford costs too much. It's too had, because he
really would have given the Stanford athletic pic
ture a boost.
Oh yes,' he also would have been a welcome ad
dition to the crew, since lie had eight arms.
Sincerely,
Paul Zimmerman
People had not seen the last of Harlan Stroud. He
was nominated for president of Stern Hall and picked
up quite a few votes. His name was signed on nu
merous blue cards, and it can be accurately said that
Harlan Stroud has Hunked more courses than anyone
else at Stanford.
To list all the shenanigans lhat Zimmerman has
pulled would take several volumes. Harlan Stroud
will always stand as the greatest. One of the tricks
that Zimmerman perfected was getting cokes out of
coke machines without paying for them.
Despite all his practical jokes, Zimbo had a heart
of gold and would give the shirt off his back for any
one he liked.
Yes, there'll never be another like Zimbo, and I
propose that we all give him a toast. Ready, every
one? All right, now . . . clink!

MIHId lt CARTOON BOOK DEPT. A very good
deal has come to our attention. A book containing G7
of Dick Bibler's best cartoons will go on sale to
morrow for 2.1 cents. They will be sold on the history
and engineering corners and in front of the post office
and the Cellar.
Bibler, who is considered the best college cartoonist
in the country, is a grad student at Stanford. A recent
sale of these books was held at Kansas University,
and they went like hotcakes. Some students even
bought nine books, in order to send some to friends
in the service.
