## In Protest Against Theater Ads 
### 
To the Editor:
It does not really bother me too much that ihe local
theaters charge 85 cents to see a moving picture those
days. What really hurts is that after we've paid that,
we. have to sit through about five minutes of adver
tising for the local merchants. If we were getting into
the show for bargain prices I could see some excuse
for subjecting US to these canned advertisements, but
at the road show prices we are charged it seems we
could be spared these.
If I'm the oidy one who is mildly griped at this,
tJien I rnitfht .as well forget it. If there are others
Xvlio don't like to be treated like a captive audience

maybe something could be done about it. The stu
dents at some other universities have found that they
could get just about what they wanted from the local
merchants, and theaters by the threat and use of stu
dent boycotts. (E.g. the "Fair-Bear" system at Cal.)
If someone else feels the same way he can get in
touch with me and we might be able to get a TV set
where we can at last turn off the sound during the
commercials.

PS. What ever happened to the serial at the Sun
flay night Flicks? I always thought that it was the
best part of the show.
