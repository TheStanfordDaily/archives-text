# Babeball Season Opens; Yanks, Dodgers Favored
## 
### DICK KLEIN Daily Sports Editor 
"Play hall" is the cry booming out
over eif.'ht major league parks
throughout the East today. Both
American and National Leagutrs
begin their season-long rush for the
buntings. In a consensus of Daily
sports scribes, the New York Yan
kees are tabbed for a repeat win
and the Brooklyn Dodgers, minus
a late-season el foldo, should be
senior circuit kingpin...
The Dodgers were a surprisingly
solid choice. The reliable old Yan- '
kees edged out the Cleveland In- !
dians in the American loop ballot
ing. First division predictions for j
the junior circuit were:
New York Yankees
Cleveland Indian-.
Detroit Tigers
Chicago White Sox
The defending champions were 1
given the nod mainly based on the
strength of their terrific one-two
three punch in the pitching staff.
Lefty Ed Lopat, Vic Rasehi, and j
Chief Allie Reynolds are all ready ;
for another great season. With Yogi J
Berra giving them tremendous help |
from behind the platter, this bat- j
tery combination should win i
enough games among themselves to j

I land at least in the first division.
Boasting such pitching luminaries
as Feller, Lemon, Garcia, Wynn,
and Gromek, the Indians may pos
sess an even better mound staff
than the occupants of the House
| That Ruth Built. But A 1 Lopez'
j charges can't match the Yankees in

known strength afield and luck tiie
long bench.
Over in tiie National League, the
finish in fall should look like thit>:
Brooklyn Dodgers
Philadelphia Phillie-,
New York Giants
Boston Braves
Even without the offerings of Big |
, Don Newcombe, the fabulous Bums
were the near-unanimous choice ol ,

the Dippy sportsmen. The Dodgers
! still can rely on the stickwork oi
j Jackie Robinson and Roy Gampa
| nella, who earned third and fourth
j in batting last year. And both can
still provide great spark and de-
I Tensive work when Brooklyn needs
| to make some outs.
The Miracle Team ol last year,
the New York Giants, falls to third
| place. Losing such greats as Willie
i Mays, Monte Irvin, and Eddie Stan
ky is too much. The Phillies, /with
| Curt Simmons back in tow, should
| bounce back to near the top.
If these predictions come true, Dr.
i Bobby Brown will get another crack
j at World Series money. The. Stan
! ford alum is still a mainstay on the
Yankee roster. The other Card ma
! jor leaguer, Lloyd Merriman, will
j see only limited action with the
1 Cincinnati Reds this year. He'll be
j drafted in a few weeks.
