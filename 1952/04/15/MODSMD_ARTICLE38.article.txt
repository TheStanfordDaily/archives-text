## Alpha Delts Win Mural Tilt 
### BOB MISHELL 
The Alpha Delts opened up the
| mural season with a 2t> to 3 shel- |
lacking over a hapless Eneina 5E
team. The Alpha Delts iced the
game with a ten-run barrage in the
very first inning.
The game was halted after only
I three innings when the hour time j
limit ran out. Pete Whorf was the j
big stickman for the Alpha Delts j
with a home run, a single, and a ;
base on balls for two official trips J
to the plate. He scored three runs
â–  and batted in lour.
Meanwhile pitcher Hank Helping
held the frosh to no hits in the first
two innings and scoreless with the
help of a sharp double play in the \
second frame. Jack Skinner tossed
to Whorf who flipped to base
man Newman Porter to effect the j
twin-killing.
Gene Pepper bashed out the lone
Encina hit in a last-minute frosh I
rally. Walks coupled with the hit j
! accounted for the three 5E tallies.
But the rally failed when time ran
j out. !

Delts 2<i, Village 312 3
Tlieta Chi I 12. Encina 2W ft

third game of a tightly contested j
match.
