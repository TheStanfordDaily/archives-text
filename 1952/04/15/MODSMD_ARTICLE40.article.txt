# Paly Hi Edged, 3-2
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
In an exciting contest yesterday
the Braves came from behind to
nose out Palo Alto High School 3
to 2. It was a wild toss into the far
reaches of right field by Paly catch
er Ned Olmstead that allowed Rog
Irvine and Terry Evans to race
home with the winning tallies.
This was an especially well
plaved struggle, and for six excit
ing frames Brave southpaw Stan
Fetterman and Paly's Wayne Davis
were all tied up at 1-1. The Braves
had counted their only run on a
wild pitch that allowed Bill Schie
decker to race home, while Paly's
only run came in the top of the
fifth.
With Lou McKellar on the hill,
the Vikings went ahead in the sev
enth canto, and then it wa.s a ques
tion of whether Davis could hold
the lead.
In the last of the eighth. Coach
Dick Clegg sent Dave Eldredge as
a pinch-hitter, and Dave responded
with a single. Irvine then slashed a
single to left, and there were run
ners o;i first and third. Evans, the
next swinger, beat out a dribbler
to second base and the bags were
loaded. The next hitter, Pete Rey
nolds, swung on the first pitch and
sent a hard ground ball to the
shortstop. Paly's Bob Dickenson
whipped the ball home to cut down
Eldredge, but when Olmstead at
tempted to throw out the batter,
his peg ended up in right field and
before the ball could be retrieved
Irvine and Evans had scored the
winning runs.
Victorious for the jayvees was
Gil Duncan, who had come on to
relieve in the eighth, while Davis
went all the way for the loss.

Gordon Galloway, Brave reserve
first baseman, laced a single to cen
i ter in the bottom of the tenth in
j ning to drive in Terry Evans and
j give the Braves an 8 to 7 win over

Galloway was also responsible for
sending the contest into overtime,
for, as pinch hitter in the last ol
the ninth, he walked and scored the
tying run.
Winning hurler for the Braves
was Larry Smith, who pitched only
the tenth inning, while lefty Hugo
Bruno of Tech took the loss.

A CLOSE ONE!—Rod Richard, right, UCLA sprinter, wins a close race in the 220. His time was
an outstanding 21.6, as he nipped Bruin George Brown, left. In the center is the lone Indian
sprinter to place in the sprints, Maury Parsons. In both this race and the 100, Parsons was nipped
near the wire by Richard. He placed second in the 100. Brown, despite this outstanding run
ning, specializes in the broad jump, and is rated the world's best. He has jumped over 26 feet.

A CLOSE ONE!—Rod Richard, right, UCLA sprinter, wins a close race in the 220. His time was
an outstanding 21.6, as he nipped Bruin George Brown, left. In the center is the lone Indian
sprinter to place in the sprints, Maury Parsons. In both this race and the 100, Parsons was nipped
near the wire by Richard. He placed second in the 100. Brown, despite this outstanding run

In an exciting contest yesterday
the Braves came from behind to
nose out Palo Alto High School 3
to 2. It was a wild toss into the far
reaches of right field by Paly catch
er Ned Olmstead that allowed Rog
Irvine and Terry Evans to race
home with the winning tallies.
This was an especially well
plaved struggle, and for six excit
ing frames Brave southpaw Stan
Fetterman and Paly's Wayne Davis
were all tied up at 1-1. The Braves
had counted their only run on a
wild pitch that allowed Bill Schie
decker to race home, while Paly's
only run came in the top of the
fifth.
With Lou McKellar on the hill,
the Vikings went ahead in the sev
enth canto, and then it wa.s a ques
tion of whether Davis could hold
the lead.
In the last of the eighth. Coach
Dick Clegg sent Dave Eldredge as
a pinch-hitter, and Dave responded
with a single. Irvine then slashed a
single to left, and there were run
ners o;i first and third. Evans, the
next swinger, beat out a dribbler
to second base and the bags were
loaded. The next hitter, Pete Rey
nolds, swung on the first pitch and
sent a hard ground ball to the
shortstop. Paly's Bob Dickenson
whipped the ball home to cut down
Eldredge, but when Olmstead at
tempted to throw out the batter,
his peg ended up in right field and
before the ball could be retrieved
Irvine and Evans had scored the
winning runs.
Victorious for the jayvees was
Gil Duncan, who had come on to
relieve in the eighth, while Davis
went all the way for the loss.
