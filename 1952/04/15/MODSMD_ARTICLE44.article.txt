# Ike is Noncommittal in Face of Pressure
## NATO Job Comes First 
### HADLEY ROFF 
Like another famous general,
General Dwight D. Eisenhower
has declared, "I shall return,"
but the manner of fight he plans
to wage is clouded in a fog of
doubt.
Apparently he will not wade ashore
with guns blazing.
When Eisenhower's resignation was
made k n own Friday, headlines
screamed and speculation flared. But
Eisenhower in a press conference
Saturday put the damper on spirits.
The only hint of future plans given
by the retiring general and presi
dential aspirant at the conference
was that he intends to be in Abilene.
Kan., June 4 for the stone-laying
ceremony of the '"Eisenhower mu
seum.' Abilene is bis home-town.
Of political matters, Eisenhower
has so far deferred answering.
He told reporters that "1 am not
Hoing to discuss any kind of political
questions, so I can devote myself to
this job."
"I must prevent politics from
nlTccting (his vital job,'' lie em
phasized several limes.
"As of this minute," he indicates
lie has no political plans, lie said
(hat lie will not campaign for the
(iOP nomination, hut would retire
from (he army if nominated a( (he
llcpiihlican convention.
Thus, il seems that Eisenhower will
slay divorced from the speech mak

ing, hand shaking-phase of politics
until the nomination is handed him.
Further, it seems that Eisenhower
j plans to take his time in coming
home. He says that he'll stay on the
NATO job until about June 1 when
he'll turn over his command.
One Taft-man scathed Eisenhower
i saying, "evidently he is expecting to
I buy a pig in a poke without a defi
nite statement from him as to his
stand and his beliefs.
Taft issued v. "cordial invitation''
(<» Eisenhower to state definite
views on domestic and foreign
issues.
Eisenhower supporters say that
such platform statements will be
made in "due time."'
Whether Eisenhower is so poli-
I tically naive that he believes him
i self a sure-win or has some up
the-slceve scheme, is not known.
Many observers feel that Eisen
hower, accustomed to the careful
obedience of army life, will be un
able to combat the rough and tumble
of American politics.
Used to the dignified strategy con
ference and SHAPE meetings, the
general will lie ill-equipped at pitch
ing nuid, an essential, many feel, in
j modern campaigning.
The I-Like-Ikers are counting
heavily on the June 4 Abileen
speech, one of three Eisenhower
speeches to be given before the July
| GOP convention.
The Abilene speech, the supporters
! feel, will give him his best chance
for yanking the American people by
the ear and say "listen here to me."
The other speeches are slated for

Columbia University-and West Point
Military Academy.
Considering the three recent
Taft land-slides in the Minnesota,
Nebraska, and Illinois primaries,
Eisenhower's "from the ground
up" support might suffer a dam
aging earthquake. Particularly
significant was the Taft victory in
Nebraska where neither Eisen
hower nor Taft was entered but
where strenuous write -in cam
paigns were waged.
While the general offered no en
couragement to his campaign work
ers, backers have been ringing door
bells and tinkling telephones in an
increasing crescendo in New Jersey,
hoping to roll out the vote for Tues
day's primary.
Ike - men admit that things are i
tough in New Jersey. They say that ;
voters of the Eastern industrial state
are apathetic and that a light vote is ;
expected. A light vote, they say will
help Taft.
However, former representative
Fred A. Hartley, co-author of the :
Taft-Hartley act and chairman of
New Jersey citizens for Taft. said
it would be a political miracle if Sen. I
Taft gets more than 20 per cent of
the total vote in the primary.
Whether Eisenhower can be en
couraged to campaign is a matter
that, the finger-crossed Ike men j
would like answered. Sen Lodge,
Eisenhower's campaign manager,
spent last week in Europe badgering
the General. But the insistence has j
apparently been unheeded by Eisen
hower.

Like another famous general,
General Dwight D. Eisenhower
has declared, "I shall return,"
but the manner of fight he plans
to wage is clouded in a fog of
doubt.
Apparently he will not wade ashore
with guns blazing.
When Eisenhower's resignation was
made k n own Friday, headlines
screamed and speculation flared. But
Eisenhower in a press conference
Saturday put the damper on spirits.
The only hint of future plans given
by the retiring general and presi
dential aspirant at the conference
was that he intends to be in Abilene.
Kan., June 4 for the stone-laying
ceremony of the '"Eisenhower mu
seum.' Abilene is bis home-town.
Of political matters, Eisenhower
has so far deferred answering.
He told reporters that "1 am not
Hoing to discuss any kind of political
questions, so I can devote myself to
this job."
"I must prevent politics from
nlTccting (his vital job,'' lie em
phasized several limes.
"As of this minute," he indicates
lie has no political plans, lie said
(hat lie will not campaign for the
(iOP nomination, hut would retire
from (he army if nominated a( (he
llcpiihlican convention.
Thus, il seems that Eisenhower will
slay divorced from the speech mak

ing, hand shaking-phase of politics
until the nomination is handed him.
Further, it seems that Eisenhower
j plans to take his time in coming
home. He says that he'll stay on the
NATO job until about June 1 when
he'll turn over his command.
One Taft-man scathed Eisenhower
i saying, "evidently he is expecting to
I buy a pig in a poke without a defi
nite statement from him as to his
stand and his beliefs.
Taft issued v. "cordial invitation''
(<» Eisenhower to state definite
views on domestic and foreign
issues.
Eisenhower supporters say that
such platform statements will be
made in "due time."'
Whether Eisenhower is so poli-
I tically naive that he believes him
i self a sure-win or has some up
the-slceve scheme, is not known.
Many observers feel that Eisen
hower, accustomed to the careful
obedience of army life, will be un
able to combat the rough and tumble
of American politics.
Used to the dignified strategy con
ference and SHAPE meetings, the
general will lie ill-equipped at pitch
ing nuid, an essential, many feel, in
j modern campaigning.
The I-Like-Ikers are counting
heavily on the June 4 Abileen
speech, one of three Eisenhower
speeches to be given before the July
| GOP convention.
The Abilene speech, the supporters
! feel, will give him his best chance
for yanking the American people by
the ear and say "listen here to me."
