## Truman to Visit Flooded Midwest 
### 
OMAHA, Neb., Wednesday, April
16 (UP) â€” The Missouri River's
mightiest crest in history soared to
ward Omaha and Council Bluffs
early today to test desperate round
the-clock efforts to hold the dikes.
Thousands of men labored
through the night, thowing sand
bags, dirt, and barricades in the
path of the relentless river, with
the record-breaking crest less than
21 hours away.
Rivermen who earlier said it
would take a "modern day miracle"
to keep flood waters from the two
city area were openly optimistic.
President Truman will fly into
the threatened area today, a few
hours before "crest hour," the dan
ger period thousands have prepared
for. He will meet with governors
from seven flood-stricken states.
Not a drop of actual flood water
has entered the threatened residen
tial areas yet. But more than 30,000
persons have Hed homes, most oi
them waiting anxiously in emer- j
gency shelters.
