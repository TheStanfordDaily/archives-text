# TUESDAY SERIES
## Writers Hailed As 'Prophets' 
### 
Prophets of our day—this is the
way Dr. Henri Barzun, noted author,
describes the writers of the late
nineteenth and early twentieth cen
turies. Dr. Barzun showed last
night's Tuesday Evening Series au
dience how these men predicted
many important ideas that were to
come about in spite of the skepticism
of their readers.
Long a writer himself, Dr. Barzun I
is well qualified to tell of "French
Literary Masters I Have Known."
"We have had for a long time the
idea that literature is just a money
maker, but there is more to it than
that; we can learn what a country
was doing when the books were J
written. The important writei's are J
men of message," he emphasized.
Two Groups
The men who began writing in j
the last quarter of the nineteenth j
century can be classified into two I
groups, according to Dr. Barzun. !
The first is those who were interested i
in the individual; the other is the
writers interested in large groups
in society.
"We have payed the consequences I
for what they said would happen," !
he noted. Lauding their works, he
regrets that, "Nobody has risen up
to take up the challenge where they j
left it."
Cited in the first group was Mau
rice Barresk, who saw that the world
might be destroyed by the rising con
flicts. Barres —an advocate of na
tionalism, traditionalism, and capital
ism—wrote a book as early as 1908
showing the volatile situation be
tween France and Germany which
was to explode in World War I.
Battle of Soul
Andre Gide wrote of the battle of
the soul. He examined the mind of
the Russian communist, the African,
and the Frenchman in face of in
vasion. Marcel Proust, however,
looked into the consequences of the
rises of certain classes to power and
their subsequent downfall.
Another viewpoint was that of
Anatole France, who thought that
the world was lost, and why should
we be lost with it? He warned his
contemporaries of the dangers of
war and revolution.
In the group of writers consider
ing large parts of society, Charles
Peguy was to bring a new idea of
Christian Socialism, which is now the
basis for many European political
parties. Paul Adam told how selfish
imperialism could ruin a nation.
Dr. Barzun described Emile Zola,
the great reformer, who foresaw the
need of a family of all Europe.
Thinking along these lines also was
Romain Roland, who argued that the
only alternative for the world was a
universal republic or a series of wars.

The men who began writing in j
the last quarter of the nineteenth j
century can be classified into two I
groups, according to Dr. Barzun. !
The first is those who were interested i
in the individual; the other is the
writers interested in large groups
in society.
"We have payed the consequences I
for what they said would happen," !
he noted. Lauding their works, he
regrets that, "Nobody has risen up
to take up the challenge where they j
left it."
Cited in the first group was Mau
rice Barresk, who saw that the world
might be destroyed by the rising con
flicts. Barres —an advocate of na
tionalism, traditionalism, and capital
ism—wrote a book as early as 1908
showing the volatile situation be
tween France and Germany which
was to explode in World War I.
Battle of Soul
Andre Gide wrote of the battle of
the soul. He examined the mind of
the Russian communist, the African,
and the Frenchman in face of in
vasion. Marcel Proust, however,
looked into the consequences of the
rises of certain classes to power and
their subsequent downfall.
Another viewpoint was that of
Anatole France, who thought that
the world was lost, and why should
we be lost with it? He warned his
contemporaries of the dangers of
war and revolution.
In the group of writers consider
ing large parts of society, Charles
Peguy was to bring a new idea of
Christian Socialism, which is now the
basis for many European political
parties. Paul Adam told how selfish
imperialism could ruin a nation.
Dr. Barzun described Emile Zola,
the great reformer, who foresaw the
need of a family of all Europe.
Thinking along these lines also was
Romain Roland, who argued that the
only alternative for the world was a
universal republic or a series of wars.
Prophets of our day—this is the
way Dr. Henri Barzun, noted author,
describes the writers of the late
nineteenth and early twentieth cen
turies. Dr. Barzun showed last
night's Tuesday Evening Series au
dience how these men predicted
many important ideas that were to
come about in spite of the skepticism
of their readers.
Long a writer himself, Dr. Barzun I
is well qualified to tell of "French
Literary Masters I Have Known."
"We have had for a long time the
idea that literature is just a money
maker, but there is more to it than
that; we can learn what a country
was doing when the books were J
written. The important writei's are J
men of message," he emphasized.
