ing groups had registered their en
tries with the office.
Theme of the float parade is "The
History of Water Transportation."
"This theme leaves plenty of room
for imagination and ingenuity," says
Jack Skinner, chairman of the
event.

lop entries. Miss Adelc Strogen, as
sistant counselor for women. John
Henderson, economics instructor, Mr.
and Mrs. Bob Wert and Dr. and
Mrs. Harry Mosher will act as judges.
The parade of floats will start from
the side of the lake behind Roble.

of! the winds which in the past have
worked against the floats.

games will be held. Sign-up sheets
for both men and women competitors
are available in all living groups.
Prizes will also be awarded to the
