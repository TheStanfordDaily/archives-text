# Liquor Sale Ban To Be Contested
## 
### 
Legal maneuvering continues as
the Santa Clara Superior Court pre
pares to hear arguments on the mile
and-a-half Stanford liquor-sales ban.
Contesting a ruling of the State
Board of Equalisation, the Palo Alto
League for Liquor Law Enforce
ment is pressing for a court decision
on how distance to liquor stores
should be measured from Stanford.
Referring to a 1922 law which pre
vents the sale of liquor within a mile
and a half of campus, the League
insists that the distance should be
measured by straight-line measure.
The Board of Equalization ruled
in February that the distance can
be measured by the shortest road
route.
