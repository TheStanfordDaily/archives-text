WASHINGTON, Apvil 15â€”Presi
dent Truman today signed the Jap
anese peace treaty and related Pa
cific defense pacts which will
change Japan from an enemy na
tion to a full-fledged ally of the
West.
Mr. Truman penned his name on
the documents in a simple cere
mony in his White House office at
tended only by photographers and
newsmen. He said it should speed
the realization of "lasting peace and
freedom with security."
It was the next-to-last step in
ending the seven-year military oc
cupation of the island nation which
plunged the United States in a war
that began with treachery and was
fought with savage fanaticism for
nearly four years.
Formal deposit of the ratification,
an act which makes the treaty ef
fective, is scheduled for April 28,
Emperor Hirohito's birthday on this
side of the International Dateline.
The treaty specifies that the Unit
ed States and five other major na
tions that fought the Japanese must
deposit their instruments of ratifi
cation before it becomes effective.
