NEWARK. IVJ., Wednesday, April
16 (UP) —Gen. Dwight D. Eisen
hower won the New Jersey Repub
lican Presidential primary election
today, but Sen. Robert A. Taft was
expected to claim a "moral victory."
Eisenhower apparently will get at
least 32 of the state's 38 "unin
structed" delegates to the Republi
can national convention — a wel
come-home present to the return
ing general.
"We will be fortunate if we get
six delegates," said Robert L. Ad
ams, former state chairman of the
Taft committee.
"I said before the election that if
we got 100,000 votes it would be a
moral victory," he said.
Victory Claimed
Eisenhower's supporters claimed
his victory early.
"The people have spoken again,"
Sen. Frank Carlson (R., Kan.), di
rector of the national Eisenhower
for - President headquarters, pro
claimed in Washington.
Harold E. Stassen, former Gov
ernor of Minnesota, lagged in third
place with a vote one - twentieth
that received by Ike. He alone of
the three campaigned throughout
this key Eastern state.
Sen. Estes Kefauver (D., Tenn.)
was unopposed on the Democratic
Presidential ticket.
Write-in Sensation
Write-in voting — the springtime
political sensation—played no part;
in the New Jersey election although
there were a handful of write-ins
for President Truman, Illinois Gov.
Adlai Stevenson, Supreme Court
Justice William O. Douglas, Gen.
Douglas Mac Arthur, and California
Gov. Earl Warren.
The total vote was expected to
soar well above 500,000, but far
short of the record 1,000,000 fore
cast. Bone-chilling cold and icy
rain held down the vote.
Heap Big Smoke
Though the election was over, the
smoke was not expected to clear
for some time.
Taft's powerful long - distance
showing was expected to have a
strong effect on the state's 38-man
delegation to the Republican na
tional convention.
The delegates are technically un
instructed, but agreed to stand by
the winner if the victory was over
whelming. At least 14 and possibly
17 of the delegates are known ti
favor Taft and may come out for
him as a result of the comparatively
close balloting.
Taft won more than 35 per cent
of the vote. Before the election,
supporters of the Ohio Senator had
said that anything over 20 per cent
would be considered a "moral vic
tory." His supporters also claimed
that 100,000 votes would show
smashing force for a candidate who
never campaigned.


MORAL VlCTORY?—Supporters of Sen. Robert A. Taft claim
that yesterday's loss in New Jersey primaries should cause no
dimming of "Mr. Republican's lamed smile, shown at its bright
est in this poster.
