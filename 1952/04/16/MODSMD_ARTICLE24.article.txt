# Parking Problem Still Acute
## 
### 
Automobiles at Stanford, which proliferate
by leaps and bounds every year, create an
acute parking problem on campus. The block
long area of the Stern parking lot, designated
as a restricted area and barred from student
use, doesn't make the problem any less acute.
The block-long row, so set off, is almost com
pletely empty throughout the day save for a
half-dozen cars.
Student cars are tagged when parked in the
section, while most of the more than 40 spaces
go begging.
Restricted areas on campus are designated
by a Committee on Buildings and Grounds.
Usually it makes excellent use of what parking
space is available on campus, but this time,
its mistake is obvious.
The committee, according to Police Chief
Gordy Davis, set the Stern area aside after nu
merous complaints that the Education Building
lot was insufficient to accommodate faculty
parking.
Davis says the move, like others, is an ex
periment. It is not inflexible, and if ihe re

stricted area proves unsatisfactory, it will be
eliminated or reduced in size. This is the only
sensible policy.
There has never been an adequate solution
to the campus parking situation. The number
of cars on campus increases with every fall's
automobile registration. New lots have been
asphalted until just about all available space
has been exhausted. It is becoming increas
ingly difficult to find areas suitable for close
to-Quad, central parking.
Chief Davis still has the best solution to the
problem: cut down unnecessary driving. Stu
dents who live on the Lower Row, Roble, and
Lagunita, operating on a super-jet schedule,
often drive to class, plugging up spaces for
those who come from farther away the Vil
lage, off-campus, etc. Many times these stu
dents are forced to leave their cars in a no
parking spot in order to get to class in time.
Until the day we develop subterranean park
ing lots or a Stanford Union Square, Davis' sug
gestion is the best solution for increased cen
tral parking on campus.
