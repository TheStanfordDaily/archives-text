### DICK McLEAN 
Mickey Spillane Comes to Stanford
Part 1
Tli current vice Czar of the pocketbook thrillers
is a bright young man named Mickey Soillane. who

writes with a loaded revolver
style and all the sensitivity of
an artist for Esquire. The ex
ploits of his tough, brutal hero,
Mike Hammer, have made both
him and his character the focal
point of much curiosity.
I've been curious too. I've
wondered how the worldly Mike
Hammer would react to the
sheltered Stanford life. There
fore. in the first person narra-

tion of Mickey Spillanc's wierd character I give
you:
ALARM ON THE FARM
as
Mickey Spillane (would have written it)
I flipped the wheel of my car and squealed a
thousand miles worth of rubber off the tires making
the turn onto Palm Drive. Yes, there it was just as
Georgie had said. Rolling foothills, sunset fires,
towers and all. Stanford. But Georgie would never
see it again because the poor little slob was lying
in a cold grave with six feet of dirty earth in his face
and somebody was going to die slowly and in agony
for it. And 1 could feel the cold lump of my .45 as
the beat of my heart played chop sticks on the leather
holster.
I fished out my deck of Luckies and lit one. Just
then my car hit a bump and I said a dirty word.
But I could still hear Georgie crying and saying,
''Honest, Mike, I was framed. I didn't cheat on that
test. I flunked it cold. Somebody hocked my test
and forged one with my name on it. It wasn't the
Honor Code Committee's fault. But I was framed."
And a little after that he'd shot himself and I was
going to even up a few things . . .
An old man was crossing the drive taking his
own sweet time. I put my fool down a little harder
on the accelerator. With a shimmering thud the
old guy stopped worrying about hurrying or living
or anything ever again. Pedestrians.
And then I saw her. She stood under a sign that
said, "Give A Lift To The Village." She were a fur

coat buttoned all the way to the collar and a halo
of blonde hair that made the mink look like skunk.
In a fur coat or a barrel she'd still look good. As I
kicked the door open for her, she smiled and that
warm feeling sneaked up my back and made me feel
like a melted cheese sandwich inside.
"Hello," she said, "What's your name?" When she
spoke, I could smell the scent of her lipstick. It was
like the taste of jellybeans. Funny, I hadn't tasted
jellybeans since I was a kid.
"Mike Hammer," I said.
"Mike?" she mused. "That's a nice name. I like
you, Mike."
"What's your name?"
"Laura."
I drove past the Quad. Slowly. I didn't want to
hurry. Not now. She said that she lived in a long,
low building over to the right so I stopped the car.
"Will you give me a call, Mike?"
"Sure," I said. She breathed a warm, jellybean
"goodbye" at me and was gone. As she swung her
way up the brick wall, I noticed that she wore no
shoes.

The next morning I picked up a time schedule
with all the class listings. I found the .class that had
finished poor Georgie and the name of the instructor.
"Professor Bottie—Room 201 m." About four o'clock
in the afternoon I found the damned room. I'd been
given so many bad directions that I was ready to
kick the door down.
I knocked and no one answered, so I did.
"Are you Professor Bottie?" I yelled at the little
guy hiding behind the desk. He couldn't talk at first.
He just rolled his white, scared eyes inside his fish
bowl glasses.
"No . . . no . . . I'm the reader. You'll have to
see Professor Bottie about having your grade
changed."
"Where is the Professor?" I asked.
Ilis mouth tried hard to lie but his eyes darted
to the door in back of him and I knew. He tried to
stop nie so I hashed him across the side of his fat
head with my .45 and he saw stars and reason at the
same instant.
I opened the door and stepped in. Then stopped
cold. Professor Bottie wore a neat tailored suit, an
amused smile, and sheer nylon stockings. Profes
sor Bottie was a woman!
