The Buck of the Month Club is again on its knees and pleading for
funds to carry on its program of sending Stanford Athletes through school.
We favor the Club but we do not favor its method of raising funds.
Basically the Buck of the Month Club serves a line purpose. It pays the
tuition of athletes who demonstrate a real and substantial need for aid.
These tuition scholarships, without which many of these athletes would
not be at Stanford, aie granted by the University in compliance with
i ules laid down by the Pacific Coast Conference. And while at Stanford
these students must maintain their academic records just the same as any
other student.
Last year the Buck Club did an excellent job. Its 3,400 subscribers made
it possible for 30 tuition grants-in-aid for football players. The first string
of the cage squad also got grants as did numerous other Stanford athletes.
Stanford's tuition is high and we find no fault in helping worthy athletes,
worthy academically speaking. Our complaint lies elsewhere.
In a letter dated March 31 and sent to all Buck Members and ''friends
of Stanford" a long plea was made for subscriptions. The letter closed,
"Mail your check to Buck Club, Box 3006, Stanford, California. Yours for
a greater Stanford." And it was signed by two of the prominent members.
What we object to is the phrase, "Yours for a greater Stanford." Since
when do athletics, good or bad, go to make a university great? We admit
that Stanford's name is undoubtedly associated more with Rose Bowl than
education throughout the various corners of this nation. But athlctics is
not what maks a university great. Rather, research, faculty, education and
the type of individual produced all go together to grade a university along
the lines of greatness.
We are very sport-conscious. To say otherwise would be fibbing. But
we hope that we will never see the day when Stanford is a greater institu
tion solely because it is an athletic power.
The letter goes on to say that Chuck Taylor needs more football help and
the number of fine boys who seek financial aid has increased faster than
Buck Club contributions. The Buck Club has therefore increased the
minimym subscription from $12 to $18 per year.
The letter adds, "If we had increased it in proportion to the increase
in tuition $33(1 to (since (lie Club's organization in 15)41) the mini
mum would be $24. In addition the value of the dollar has decreased
50% since the founding of the Club."
All that is fine. And from it v/e conclude that the price of athletic- skill
has likewise gone sky-high. If such be the case it is too bad and a de
emphasis is definitely needed. We never before realized that the atheltic
power of a university varied along the same scale as the almighty dollar.
We had contributed ups and downs to lean years in material, not in the
devaluation of our coinage system.
We got a laugh from a folder enclosed with the letter. After going on
and on with the virtues of becoming a Buck member, the next to the last
paragraph reads, "Gifts to Stanford University are of course deductible
as charitable contributions for income tax purposes."
Charitable seems a bit strange of a word to use and is stretching a
point.
And what do the subscribers get for the $18? They get ticket preference
for Stanford football ducats. And they are good seats. Right there is the
reason for many a subscriber. It is an ideal setup for those who have no
connection with the University but who are willing to kick in $18 to be
assured seats at all games. Why, it isn't anything at all to scalp a Big
Game ticket, one of the pair given subscribers, and almost make up the
price of membership.
We quote again from the folder concerning a donation which is "certainly
justified by the very real and tangible benefits resulting from each contri
bution." If it means better football teams we concur and support the Club,
but if it means a greater university we wish to hear no more of it. For
great universities are not built from athletic teams.

the type of individual produced all go together to grade a university along
the lines of greatness.
We are very sport-conscious. To say otherwise would be fibbing. But
we hope that we will never see the day when Stanford is a greater institu
tion solely because it is an athletic power.
The letter goes on to say that Chuck Taylor needs more football help and
the number of fine boys who seek financial aid has increased faster than
Buck Club contributions. The Buck Club has therefore increased the
minimym subscription from $12 to $18 per year.
The letter adds, "If we had increased it in proportion to the increase
in tuition $33(1 to (since (lie Club's organization in 15)41) the mini
mum would be $24. In addition the value of the dollar has decreased
50% since the founding of the Club."
All that is fine. And from it v/e conclude that the price of athletic- skill
has likewise gone sky-high. If such be the case it is too bad and a de
emphasis is definitely needed. We never before realized that the atheltic
power of a university varied along the same scale as the almighty dollar.
We had contributed ups and downs to lean years in material, not in the
devaluation of our coinage system.
We got a laugh from a folder enclosed with the letter. After going on
and on with the virtues of becoming a Buck member, the next to the last
paragraph reads, "Gifts to Stanford University are of course deductible
as charitable contributions for income tax purposes."
Charitable seems a bit strange of a word to use and is stretching a
point.
And what do the subscribers get for the $18? They get ticket preference
for Stanford football ducats. And they are good seats. Right there is the
reason for many a subscriber. It is an ideal setup for those who have no
connection with the University but who are willing to kick in $18 to be
assured seats at all games. Why, it isn't anything at all to scalp a Big
Game ticket, one of the pair given subscribers, and almost make up the
price of membership.
We quote again from the folder concerning a donation which is "certainly
justified by the very real and tangible benefits resulting from each contri
bution." If it means better football teams we concur and support the Club,
but if it means a greater university we wish to hear no more of it. For
great universities are not built from athletic teams.
The Buck of the Month Club is again on its knees and pleading for
funds to carry on its program of sending Stanford Athletes through school.
We favor the Club but we do not favor its method of raising funds.
Basically the Buck of the Month Club serves a line purpose. It pays the
tuition of athletes who demonstrate a real and substantial need for aid.
These tuition scholarships, without which many of these athletes would
not be at Stanford, aie granted by the University in compliance with
i ules laid down by the Pacific Coast Conference. And while at Stanford
these students must maintain their academic records just the same as any
other student.
Last year the Buck Club did an excellent job. Its 3,400 subscribers made
it possible for 30 tuition grants-in-aid for football players. The first string
of the cage squad also got grants as did numerous other Stanford athletes.
Stanford's tuition is high and we find no fault in helping worthy athletes,
worthy academically speaking. Our complaint lies elsewhere.
In a letter dated March 31 and sent to all Buck Members and ''friends
of Stanford" a long plea was made for subscriptions. The letter closed,
"Mail your check to Buck Club, Box 3006, Stanford, California. Yours for
a greater Stanford." And it was signed by two of the prominent members.
What we object to is the phrase, "Yours for a greater Stanford." Since
when do athletics, good or bad, go to make a university great? We admit
that Stanford's name is undoubtedly associated more with Rose Bowl than
education throughout the various corners of this nation. But athlctics is
not what maks a university great. Rather, research, faculty, education and
the type of individual produced all go together to grade a university along
the lines of greatness.
