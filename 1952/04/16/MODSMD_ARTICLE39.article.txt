# USF Trounces Stanford Despite Essegian's Homer
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
Chuck Essegian's fifth Sunken
Diamond home-run was the only
Stanford highlight in an otherwise
disma! afternoon of baseball yester
day in the Sunken Diamond. USF's
baseballers clobbered the Stanford
nine, 13-5.
The broad-shouldered left-fielder
hit his long lazy blast in the fourth
inning. It was the 19th blast hit out
of the spacious field and Essegian
has over a quarter of them.
Stanford jumped off to a one run
]ead when Warren Goodrich walked,
stole second and came home on Hal
Skillman's clean single to right.
Essegian made it 2-0 in the fourth.
Meanwhile, starter Phil Page was
cruising along, but in the fifth in
ning, his infield fell apart and he
came tumbling after. A walk and
a single and two errors was followed
by three more walks by Page.
In the fifth, the Dons iced the
game with a five-hit four-run bar
rage off Page and Mike Acker. In
the ninth, the Hilltoppers tagged re
liefer Fred Brown for five more runs.
Stanford pushed over one in the
fifth on hits by Acker, Rich Scra
maglia, and Goodrich. In the bottom
of the ninth they countered two more
hits by Dave Rosenkrantz and Good
rich.
