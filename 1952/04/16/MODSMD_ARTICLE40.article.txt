# Thigh Injury to Restrict Mathias To Shot, Discusin Troy Crucial
## 
### DICK KLEIN 
The terrible Trojan has taken his annual toll on Farm spring
sports. It happens every year.
This time it's Bob Mathias, the all-around star and big point
getter. The outstanding track and field competitor, who was just
rounding into top-flight condition, will not be able to run against

the University of Southern Cul this't
Saturday in the Coliseum. This an
nouncement ruined any hopes cf a
good showing against the powerful
Troy thinclads.
Late yesterday afternoon team
physicians and trainer Connie Jar
vis ordered the Olympic decathlon
king to take- a rest cure for the
slight cramp in his left thigh. Heat
and daily massage are the pre
scriptions for the remainder of the
week. He will not work out at all.
The injury developed last Satur
day when Bob was whipping
through one of the best low hurdle
races fo his career. As he came
over the third barrier, Mathias
winced and then glanced to Coach
Jack Weierfhauser, who was sta
tioned along the sidelines.
The injury itself is very slight.
There was no muscle pull or torn

tissue. This type of cramp is very
j common in most athletics, particu
larly among track competitors. Usu
ally it is more severe, but Weiers
iiauser and everyone else concerned
feel that caution is necessary, espe
cially .since there are to many more
meets left on the schedule and the
Olympic
According to the latest informa
tion, Bob will compete in only the
shot put and the discus. These two
events place the least strain on the
injured thigh. The hurdles are defi
nitely out, and the broad jump, pole
vault, and high jump require the
tuke-oH on the left foot.
Not counted on for any definite
firsts, Mathias looked good for
points in both hurdles, in the pole
vault, javelin, arid the two weight
events.
