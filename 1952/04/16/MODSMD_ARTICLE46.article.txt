# Pole Tells of Russian Army Marking Time As 363,000 'Allies' Die in Warsaw Revolt
## Psychological Demand for Liberty Explained by Former Polish Officer 
### BARBARA TUERK 
His name is Janusz Zawody.
He's a broad-faced, slightly bald
ing, bright-eyed young man, a
Pole studying at Stanford for his
doctorate in Political Sciences.
He speaks softly and undra
matically. But his story is start
ling.
For J. (as he is called in this
country) Zawodny fought lour
years with the Polish underground
army, and lived through the War
saw uprising of 1944. The story he
tells is not his own but that of his
nation.
The battle of Poland began for
J. Zawodny in 1940, when be was
17. "Little Bear," as lie was
known, carried messages for the
Polbh underground army, mes
sages rolled up into tiny capsules
and hidden inside cigarettes or in
bis mouth.
At the same time he was ob
taining his high school diploma
from an underground school staffed
by the best pre-war instructors.
Education never stopped in Poland,
despite the facts that there were no
books and no school rooms, and
clandestine teaching was punishable
by death.

i At the non-com camp be later
attended, students learned every
thing from of In
fantry to Methods of Sabotage.
The Polish underground army to
which Zawodny belonged kept 600,-
000 of Hitler's best troops tied up
in "conquered" Poland. Every Ger
man transport going to Russia had
to pass through Poland.
The Polish underg ound army,
one of the best organized in Eu
rope, acted under the Polish gov
ernment in exile in London, in
constant communication with the
Allied forces. It was a large army.
Over .'{oo,ooo Poles fought active
ly, and almost ev.erv individual
citizcn contributed some support.
From non-com school J. Zawodny
wont to officer cadets' school, the
underground's equivalent of our
We.it Point. But in Poland, 60 per
cent of all graduates were dead by
1944.
The crucial time for the Poles
arrived in September, 1944, when
the approaching Soviet Army, only
11 miies from Warsaw, promised
through their radio station that if
the Poles would capture the city's
bridges, the Russians would arrive
to liberate the city within three
days.
With the permission of the exile
government, the Polish command
er-in-chief, General Boer, ordered
an uprising of the whole population.
The Poles held the bridges for
;{() days. The Russians had prom
ised to come in three days. The
Russians came, they came as far
as the other side of the river and
stopped. "We could see them
through our binoculars, only one
mile awav, picking tomatoes in
the fields."
The Poles had no tanks, no ar
tillery, no planes, only small arms.
And against them were arrayed
Germany's four best divisions.
"Who fought? Everyone fought,"
Zawodny emphasizes. "In my pla

toon I had a university professor as
sergeant. I had industrial workers
and 16 girls. I had three messenger
boys, the oldest 12 and the youngest
eight."
Zawodny's unit fought in the
Old Town, "squeezed tighter ev
ery day, under constant artillery
lire." In (he first month of flirt
ing 70 per cent of the group were
killed, and 30 per cent of the rest
wounded. Civilians died at the
same rate. "And a'l the time we
could look through our binoculars
and see the Russians so close."
After a month in the besieged
Old Town, Zawodny's group tried
to break through the German lines
to reach the last remnant of the
Polish army still fighting elsewhere
in the city. Driven back above
ground, the Poles were forced to
take to the sewers.
"The two-mile walk took eight
hours through water up to our
shoulders, with Germans shower
ing down grenades from every
street corner above. We dragged
casualties through the water. But
many suffocated before reaching
the destination."
In their new location the Poles
fought on for 30 more days. But

now not only did Stalin refuse to
send his army to their aid, hut he
would not allow U.S. or British
bombers carrying supplies to land
fcr refueling on Russian - held
Polish land.
Finally when ammunition ran
out, when 91 per cent of the town
was leveled, when 363,000 people
had died, the Poles were forced to
surrender, and Zawodny was sent
to a German prison camp.
"There arc," he said, "certain val
ues which cannot be abused with
out creating so much psychological
resentment that the people will risk
even death to manifest this reac
tion. One of the values which can
not be disturbed is liberty in the
Western meaning of the word."
