# 'See Your World' Travelogue Slated
## 
### 
Are you going to Europe thus
summer, or just hoping to get there
some day? Or are you interested
in a more unusual trip, such as an
excursion to the North Pole?
An idea of what there is to see
in both these areas will be pro
vided in a travelogue entitled "See
Your World," which will be given
by Los Arcos Eating Club tonight
at 7:30 in the Los Arcos room in
the Eating Club Build-ng. Three
talks on Europe and one on the
polar region will be presented by
members of the club and illustrated
by Kodachrome slides.
"From Flanders to the Follies" is
the itinerary to be followed by Hal
Rogers in his description of Europe
from the Netherlands to Paris Bob
Denning will tell of his travels in
England, and Forrest Riordan will
take his audience on an "Alpine
Summer" with the aid of colored
slides.
"Four Hundred Miles from the
North Pole" was the point reached
by Eugene Rauen on an expedition
with the Signal Corps last year. He
will present slides showing various
areas of the polar region, glacieis,
and ice caps.
The travelogue is open to the en
tire campus free of charge, and re
freshments will be served.
