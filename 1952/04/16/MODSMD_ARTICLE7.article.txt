# Card Aids Cow in Distress
## 
### 
Med stue'ents spend a lot of
time and money learning obstet
rics, but Louis Christian, Stanford
geology student, performed his
first delivery without a single les
son.
Friday afternoon, Louis was in
Coalinga on a field trip. Hiking
up a canyon, he heard the sounds
of an animal in distress, and in
vestigated. He found a cow who
had been unsuccessfully trying to
give birth to a calf.
Louis enlisted the aid of a near
by rancher and his wife. They
worked for four grueling hours,
attempting to extract the calf, ;.l

ready dead, from its half-dead
mother.
After tying the cow to a tree,
they connected the calf's legs to
Christiansen's pick-up truck with
another rope and drove off slowly
in the opposiLe direction. At 6 p.m.
the three non-professional obste
tricians succeeded in delivering
the calf.
Saturday morning Louis paid a
post-operative visit to the patient
and found her stil lying down,
but eating grass with a healthy
appetite. Sunday the patient,
though wobbly, was walking
around the field.
