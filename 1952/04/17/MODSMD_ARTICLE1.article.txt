# Stevenson Withdraws From Democratic Race
## Illinois Governor, Reputed H.S.T.'s Favorite, Leave's Field Wide Open 
### 
SPRINGFIELD, 111., April 16 (UP)—Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson of
Illinois slammed the door on the Democratic Presidential nomina
tion today, leaving the field wide open for a cluster of other hope
fuls.
Stevenson reportedly was President Truman's personal choice

for the nomination, a backing that
would have carried great weight at
the Democratic national convention
in Chicago in July.
The suave, 52-year-old Gover
nor had insisted all along, however,
that he only wanted to be re-elect
ed Govirnor.
Few believed him, prompting him
to issue a 300 - word "clarifying"
statement today which said:
"I have repeatedly said that I was
a candidate for Governor of Illi
nois and had no other ambition.
To this I must now add that . . .
I could not accept the nomination
for any other olTice this summer."
Stevenson left immediately to face
Mr. Truman in a conference of flood
zone Governors at Omaha. Reputed
ly, the President had twice offered
Stevenson his backing as chief of the
party if he would make the race.
Asked at Omaha whether he was
disappointed by Stevenson's state
ment, Mr. Truman replied':
"I haven't seen it and I don't in
tend to look at it."
The Stevenson fade-out left Sen
ators Estcs Kcfauver of Tennessee,
a consistent primary election win
ner, Richard Russell of Georgia,
and Robert Kerr of Oklahoma as
avow e d Democratic candidates.
Vice-President Alben YV. Isarkley
was hovering 011 the fence.
Republican leaders hailed Steven
son's decision as an indication th
Democrats know the GOP is too
strong this year.
Senate Republican Leader Styles
Bridges (N. 11.) said at Washington
that the announcement "indicates
that he came to the decision that
the Democrats have an increasingly
remote chance of winning the 1952
elections."
Kerr said that "I know of no hap
pier situation for a candidate than
for his distinguished opponents to
withdraw." Barkley said Steven
son announceemnt made no differ
ence to him—he will announce his
plans one way or the other when he
gets ready.

SPRINGFIELD, 111., April 16 (UP)—Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson of
Illinois slammed the door on the Democratic Presidential nomina
tion today, leaving the field wide open for a cluster of other hope
fuls.
Stevenson reportedly was President Truman's personal choice

for the nomination, a backing that
would have carried great weight at
the Democratic national convention
in Chicago in July.
The suave, 52-year-old Gover
nor had insisted all along, however,
that he only wanted to be re-elect
ed Govirnor.
Few believed him, prompting him
to issue a 300 - word "clarifying"
statement today which said:
"I have repeatedly said that I was
a candidate for Governor of Illi
nois and had no other ambition.
To this I must now add that . . .
I could not accept the nomination
for any other olTice this summer."
