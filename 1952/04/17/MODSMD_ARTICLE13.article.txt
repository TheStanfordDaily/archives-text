# '"The Unknown Woman" Writes Her Own Epitaph'
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
"The Unknown Woman," which opened a four-night run on the
i stage of the Little Theater last evening, writes its own epitaph. At
one point the hero, commenting on the proceedings to his man,
says, "If I had foreseen this drudgery, I would have had myself
inoculated with typhoid fever." Audiences are likely to echo

his words.
Not, of course, that Armand Sala
crou's play—presented now for the
first time in the U.S. in translation
from the French by Paul liahn—
hasn't its compensations. Act One,
indeed, seems quite promising.
As the curtain x'.ses, Ulysses
(Stanley Glenn) shoots himself
for the love of his unfaithful wife
(Patricia Beverly). Into ihis sit
uation rushes Ulysses' man (Paul
liahn), who explains to the audi
ence that according to the 'rules
by which men die, his master will
relive his life in memories.
The arrival of these various
memories—in the persons of a 20-
year-old grandfather wearing fuli
dress officer's uniform, an ancient
father, and sundry women—is quite
diverting.
But the fault of this device, its
novelty toon rubbed off, becomes
woefuly obvious early in the sec
ond act. Being memories, the events
revolving around the characters are
never fully dramatized; by and
large, they are merely discussed.
The result is not unlike an evening
spent listening to a great - uncle
plod through one recollection of his
youth after another.
Playwright Salacrou's philoso
phy seems to be that memories
are what make life worth living.
But in such a fashion and at such
length has lie chosen to expound
his belief that what lie has writ
ten is no play at all, but rather a
philosophic dialogue.
All of which—aiter the train of
just such talky vehicles lately pa
raded across the Little Theater's
stage — gives cause to wonder if
drama and drama tic action have
been permanently barred from its
boards.
The acting seems neither inspired
nor uninspired. Hahn makes an el
egant Nicholas, Glenn is good as his
master. Miss Beverly, however, is
disappointing as the erring wife,
who too often is archly petulant
and nothing more. Hugo Mclchione,
from whom distinctive characteri
zations are usually a rule rather
than an exception, does surprisingly
little with his role as headmaster.
But Jay Hern, playing the grand
father, does much to enliven the
more tedious moments.
