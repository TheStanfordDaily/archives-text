# Flood Crest Rising
## President Truman Shocked at Damage 
### 
OMAHA, Neb., April 16 (UP)â€”President Truman arrived today
from an aerial inspection of the devastating Midwestern floods
and blasted the economy bloc in Congress for thwarting his fed
eral flood control proposals.
He went into conference with the Governors of seven flood-

j affected states and invited them to
j join him in "lobbying" for a Mis
souri Basin control program.
The Presidential plane Independ
ence arrived at OfTutt Air Force Base
near here as a record Missouri River
flood crest surged toward the Oma
ha-Council Bluffs, la., area and Army
engineers gave the sister citie:s a
"50-50 chance" to escape behind pro
: tecting dikes.
Mr. Truman was met by Ls. Gen.
j Lewis A. Pick, chief of Army Engi
neers, who told him that the floods
have caused damage of "as much as
$200,000,000 and no doubt it will go
higher."
The crest of the Missouri was 25
I miles upstream at Blair, Neb., and
! due to hit here at 9 p.m. CST Thurs
day at 31.5 feet, more than 12 feet
over flood stage and the highest crest
on record.
Today the river stood at 23.,'J feet,
lapping near the tops of dikes which
were 31.5 feet high but have been
built up another two feet.
Obviously shocked by what he had
I seen over the flooded Missouri and
I Mississippi River valleys, the Presi
dent said that "it's worse than I
thought it would be."
He emphasized he was "not run
ning tor office" and was speaking
only as a "lobbyist for 155,000,000
Americans when he called upon the
Governors to join him in an aomitted
pressure program to win Congres
sional approval of his fiscal 1953
flood control budget.
"It is time for action," Mr. Tru
man said. "We have fooled around
long enough. "This is the breadbas
ket of the nation. It ought to he pro
tected and it can be protected."
He apologized for making what ap
pared to be a "Democratic speech,"
but charged that "we've got an econ
omy wave on in Congress, wiping out
some of the most important project.
I have presented and it should not
be done."
"I hope." he told the Governor:,
"that you will get behind me in this
and I hope the Congress will stick
to that budget on flood control,"
Mr. Truman boarded his big plane
immediately after the conference to
return to Washington.
