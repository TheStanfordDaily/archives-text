A danced menu, complete from
hors d'oeuvres to a flaming dessert,
will be presented to the audience of
"Le Gourmand," one of the ballets
to be performed by the San Fran
cisco Ballet Company in Memorial
Auditorium Monday night at 8:15.
"Le Gourmand" is a classic ballet,
governed rigidly bv the music, Mo
zart's "Divertimenti." It tells the
story of a glutton who commands
his servants to bring him the ideal
dinner party, and the result is a
danced menu, where the dancers
constitute Cach course.
The surprise of the ballet is the
manner in which the glutton re
acts to the dinner party of his
dreams, and the ending, although
unusual, is even happier than the
ending of a classical fairy story.
This ballet was the hit of San Fran
ci co Ballet's season last spring.
Also on the program will be
"Swan Lake," "Serenade," and
"Parranda." Tickets for the per
formance may be obtained at (he
ASSU Concert Series office in the
Nitery from 1 to 5 on weekdays
and on Saturday from 9 to 12, or
by calling DA 3-3870. Prices are
$2.50, $2, $1.50, and $1.


FROM SOUP TO NUTS.â€”Roland Vazquez and Nancy John
son are among the principal dancers who will perform in "Le
Gourmand," one of the ballets to be presented Monday night
in Memorial Auditorium.
