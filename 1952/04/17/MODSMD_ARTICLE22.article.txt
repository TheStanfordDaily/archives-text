# National Fraternities and Brotherhood

### 
From Newsweek, April 14:
"When Sigma Chi's at the University of Chi
cago made plans last fall to initiate a Jewish
student, a Chicago alumni committee threat
ened to sell their chapter house from under
them. On Nov. 30 —one day before the sched
uled initiation — the 96-year-old national fra
ternity placed the 54-year-oid Chicago chapter
on probation, stripping it of all powers to pledge
and initiate. The Jewish boy subsequently
dropped out of the controversy.
"Last week the remaining twenty Sigma Chi's
at Chicago dropped out, too. They established
a new local fraternity, Nu Sigma Chi, without
racial bars. Said Paul Hanson Jr., 23, former
head of the local Sigma Chi's and president of

the new group: 'The founders of Sigma Chi
said that 'true brotherhood could only prosper
when men of unlike minds, talents, and per
sonalities banded themselves together under
a common set of ideals.' We still believe in that
idea."
* ★ ★
We also believe in that idea. We wonder
how many Stanford fraternities would have
done what the Chicago Sigma Chi's did. More
important, we wonder how much the potential
pressure of alumni and national fraternity head
quarters influences Stanford fraternities to the
point that they are reluctant to place themselves
in this kind of position.
Not an easy question to answer, but we doubt
if it can be answered, "none."
