### DICK McLEAN 
Mickey Spillane Comes to Stanford
Part 2
(Synopsis—As we left Mike Hammer yesterday in
his adventure entitled "Alarm On The Farm," he
was seeking the person who framed his friend,
Georgie. Mike was already steamed by one siren
named Laura and is now facing Professor Bottie
who he is surprised to discover is a woman.)

"What did you expect? Chimes?" Professor Bottie
said with a little smirk playing peek-a-boo from one
end of her rich mouth to the other.
"I thought .. . I stammered.
"You thought I was a man."
I may have thought that a minute before but not
now. She was as much woman as any woman has
any right to be. The horn rim glasses didn't hide the
smukey, languid eyes nor the look that swam deep
within them. The straight lines of her manish suit
didn't fool anybody either. No wonder poor Georgie
couldn't concentrate on this class.

"What do you want, Mr. . . .?"
she asked.
If I'd answered that question
honestly, she would have slugged
me.
"Hammer. Mike Hammer," I
said.
"What can I do for you, Mike?"
"Will you tell me about a little
guy named Georgie that you had
in your class last quarter? He
was short, fat, kind of a slob but

with a heart of gold, Professor . .
"Call me Elaine, Mike. I'll like it much better.
Now let me see. A slob named Georgie? Oh yes! He
wasn't very bright. When he got a perfect score on
his final, I turned him over to the authorities for
investigation. What's he doing now?"
'"He's dead," I said. I got Georgie's blue book and
checked the writing. A clever forgery all right.
Elaine gave me the class list and suggested I look up
a buddy of Georgie's named Felix.
When I was leaving, Elaine said. "You think you
can remember how to find room 201 m again?"
"Sure," I said.
* * *
I called DA 2-2151 and asked for Laura. She gave
me a list of the local places where I might find Felix.
She sounded lonely so I promised to drop over to her
place after midnight.
At Chez-Something-Or-Other they hr.dn't seen
Felix but a funny looking dog with a top notch

barked at me so I hit it with a saucer and flattened
it.
At another place I ate three bowls of stele pop
corn while waiting, but no Felix.
I walked into one place and a little guy smiled a
lisping smile and said, "Good evening, Monsieur."
I didn't know what "monseiur" meant so I shot him
in the leg. He had two legs so I shot him twice.
Once in each.
Hut in a little barn of a place out in the hi lis I
found Felix. He was fat like Georgie and seemed
scared. Felix was readv to talk. He explained all
about something called a "curve" where the whole
class plays a game of odd-man-out and the low man
flunks. It was Felix's theory that someone was
afraid that Georgie would beat him in the class, so
that person rigged the frame.
"Who was it?" I asked.
Felix started to answer but a screaming slug ripped
through the window and put a period on the sentence
before it even began. He didn't finish his beer either.
I bolted out the door but the ceiling and the floor
fell on me at the same time. The next thing I knew,
Laura was soothing my head and saying, "Mike, Mike
what happened?"
She helped me into her car and we started home.
But the blast on the head had shaken something
loose. A name on the class list—L. Horner. Who did
I know who's name began with "L"?
"Laura," I said in an innocent voice, "I don't even
know your last name."
"Horner," she answered sweetly as she smiled
down the barrel of her .1)2 snub nose revolver.
"Horner. Just as on the class list in your pocket."
(I'd forgotten that this brainy beauty was a Stanford
Girl. Clever. Ruthless. Beguiling.)
"I'm going to hate messing up your pretty face with
a nasty, old bullet," she said.
Poor Laura. She didn't see the truck and trailer
swing out of the side street and plunge toward us.
I did. I opened the door and rolled out just before
the splattering, crunching, splintering crash.
# * *
As I was going down Palm Drive leaving all of it
behind—the Quad. Laura, Professor Elaine, and the
hot lump of hate that had gnawed at my belly—my
lights outlined the figure of a girl standing under
that same sign. She was a blonde like Laura had
been. Blonde and lanky like the other one. But I
didn't stop. Sure, it might have been fun but the
lipstick wouldn't have srnelled the same. I could just
tell it wouldn't.
And then I hit that bump in the road and said a
dirty word.
THE END
