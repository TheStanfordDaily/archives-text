# 'Seab' Editorial in 'Poor Taste, Quite Misleading'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Your editorial entitled, "Student Scabs and the
Phone Strike" was, in my opinion, in very poor taste,
and quite misleading. It was in poor taste because
it was a very strong partisan writing, and such has
been bodily outlawed by Excom's action against the
Young Republican Movement here on campus. This
editorial of which I am speaking was obviously
written with the intent of sympathizing with the
Telephone Worker's Union, and of biasing the reader
against the management and ownership of the Tele
phone Company. This is evidenced from the begin
ning by the frequent use of the word "scab," when in
ferring to those non-union men employed by the
phone company so as to carry out the vital service
which they normally perform.
The editorial is very misleading for it doesn't men
lion the causes of the strike—that the strikers are
holding out for a wage increase which would cost
the Phone Company approximately six hundred dol
lars annually for every union employee. You don't
mention the closed shop—the most undemocratic of
the many undemocratic union activities, and which
should obviously be outlawed as unconstitutional by
the Supreme Court, along with the Union or "Open"
shop.
To quote the editorial: "Regardless of the specific
issues involved in the current strike, we respect
labor's right to strike in this case, for its action has
not paralyzed the service of this public utility." Now,
Mr. Editor, I would like to ask you why the strike
lias not paralyzed the telephone service of the na
tion? I can easily answer this question; for it is
these same "scabs," whom you so blithely attack,
who are keeping service near to normal.
These are the people, some of them college stu
dents, that are making life safe for the average Ameri-

can in spite of the strike. These are the people who
are handling daily emergencies and who are en
abling normal business transactions to continue to
be carried on. Are we expected to stop work, let our
houses burn down, when a tiny group of people de
cide they need more money? I say no, and I'm quite
sure that "The Daily" would say no were telephone
service appreciably curtailed. I say, God bless the
"scabs" and the everlasting freedom that they rep
resent. STEWART M. LEDBETTER
(Editor's note: If the Daily editorial to which
reader Ledbetter refers was misleading, the Daily
apologizes, ami submits that if so, it was entirely
unintentional. We cannot agree thai what was an
attempt at fairness, and we feel a successful at
tempt. should be construed as "poor taste." As to
use of the word "scab," it is unfortunate that many
words in common usage have accumulated emo
tional connotations. It is our attempt to choose
those words that liest convey our thoughts, realiz
ing that at times they must he imperfect.
(Any expression of opinion on so controversial
a problem as labor-management relations is bound
to be subject to the displeasure of some readers.
This we realize. We attempt to keep emotional bias
out of Daily editorials, but unfortunately human
beings are not always entirely successful in this
attempt.

To quote the editorial: "Regardless of the specific
issues involved in the current strike, we respect
labor's right to strike in this case, for its action has
not paralyzed the service of this public utility." Now,
Mr. Editor, I would like to ask you why the strike
lias not paralyzed the telephone service of the na
tion? I can easily answer this question; for it is
these same "scabs," whom you so blithely attack,
who are keeping service near to normal.
These are the people, some of them college stu
dents, that are making life safe for the average Ameri-

can in spite of the strike. These are the people who
are handling daily emergencies and who are en
abling normal business transactions to continue to
be carried on. Are we expected to stop work, let our
houses burn down, when a tiny group of people de
cide they need more money? I say no, and I'm quite
sure that "The Daily" would say no were telephone
service appreciably curtailed. I say, God bless the
"scabs" and the everlasting freedom that they rep
resent. STEWART M. LEDBETTER

To the Editor:
Your editorial entitled, "Student Scabs and the
Phone Strike" was, in my opinion, in very poor taste,
and quite misleading. It was in poor taste because
it was a very strong partisan writing, and such has
been bodily outlawed by Excom's action against the
Young Republican Movement here on campus. This
editorial of which I am speaking was obviously
written with the intent of sympathizing with the
Telephone Worker's Union, and of biasing the reader
against the management and ownership of the Tele
phone Company. This is evidenced from the begin
ning by the frequent use of the word "scab," when in
ferring to those non-union men employed by the
phone company so as to carry out the vital service
which they normally perform.
The editorial is very misleading for it doesn't men
lion the causes of the strike—that the strikers are
holding out for a wage increase which would cost
the Phone Company approximately six hundred dol
lars annually for every union employee. You don't
mention the closed shop—the most undemocratic of
the many undemocratic union activities, and which
should obviously be outlawed as unconstitutional by
the Supreme Court, along with the Union or "Open"
shop.
