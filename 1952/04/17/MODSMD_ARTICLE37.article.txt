# DICK KLEIN
## The 						Sporting Line 
### 
Bob Mathias will only see limited action against the Trojans this Satur
day. That was the development after Bob suffered a cramp going over the
hurdles in last weekend's triumph over the Bruins. At the time, Jack
Weiershauser, Connie Jarvis, and even Bob himself thought that the trouble
would not be severe enough to keep him from competition.
Trojan Jinx —An Old Story
But it ends up to be the same old story. Everytime the Indians appear
to he rounding into form for the traditionally powerful USC track forces

something always pops up to ruin any slim chance of
an upset. Call it the Trojan Jinx or whatever you
want, but the Stanfords just never fare very well
against Troy.
Last season discus-tosser Ian Reed sat out the
meet and Bobby Bryan and Merritt Van Sant were
available for limited duty only. Bryan could only
gain a tie for third in his low hurdle speciality. Van
Sant, by some miracle, got off a terrific jump on his
last effort (the doctor only allowed three) and nosed
out Fred Flores for first.
If all that trouble with a long hospital list wasn't
enough, the meet was washed out and had to be
rescheduled. After being built up to such a peak and

wuii terrinc attendance expectation, the meet was eventually held on a
dismal, windy Monday afternoon. And the Cards got cleaned with SC
rolling up 81V2 points.
In 1950. a situation similar to the Mathias ache unfolded. Gay Bryan
was the versatile workhorse of the Indian thinclads. He was high jump
ing, broad jumping, hurdling, and running the sprints. But came time
for the USC meet the Gaylord did not appear in the Coliseum. He had a
badly pulled muscle. Later in the season he demonstrated his terrific
ability by scoring five firsts and 25 points against UCLA. But the Bruins
were weak and Gay just added to their misery.
Four other Card trackmen sat out the '50 meet. Van Sant had his bad
thigh that plaqued him for a lung time and distancemen Bob Barry, Warren
Ward, and John Kaufman failed to make the hard trip to the Southern
Cal slaughterhouse.
It all adds up to the sad fact that the Indians have not taken the
Trojan measure since 1933. That's riyht. El Troje has racked up 16 straight
wins over the Stanfords. But heck, we can always point with pride to
the good old days. From 1908 to 1925, the Indians chalked up 22 wins
without a loss.
The absence of Mathias is a real blow. For, if all the close events and
places had gone to the Indians, the score would have been nip and tuck
down to the final relay. But without Mathias, there is a gaping hole in
the Card hurdle forces and missing strength in javelin and pole vault.
And SC is loaded in all these events except the javelin, and now could
easily score clean sweeps.
There is 110 question, in my mind, of the wisdom of holding Bob in
check. Why have him throw away the rest of the season? It doesn't add
up with so much in the future. Besides important meets with Oxy and Cal,
there are the PCC finals, the Nationals, and trips to Hawaii, and, of course,
the Olympics.
No one was more eager to get a crack at SC. Up until the doctors made
the final orders, Bob was all set to rest up his thigh and then compete.
But with so much at stake, there is no reason to risk aggravating the
cramped condition. In other words, we agree with the decision even though
most of us have never seen USC lose in a dual meet.
Mathias and Decathlon
Back to Mathias and his efforts to defend the decathlon title. Many
have bemoaned the revised scoring schedule that seems to be prejudiced
against Stanford's Bob. All the changes seem to cut down the most in
the events where he is the strongest.
What has been done in the new scoring system is to readjust the award
ing of points to more modern standards. The greatest improvements in
recent years have been in the field events, especially the shot and discus,
and the hurdles. Thus the standards have been raised considerably, making
it more difficult to hit the 1000-point perfection mark in any event. It so
happens that Bob is strong in the hurdles, discus, and shot.
What the revision does is reduce his world-record point total of 8042 to
a still good 7443, if he made the same times and distances under the new
scoring system. Bob Richards, one of the world's best pole vaulters and
Bob's main competitors, drops down about 600 points too. A man like
Albans, recently of Occidental, who is primarily a track man, gets reduced
only a little—from 7361 to 7102.
All the worry is silly. Bob is still the best ten event man in the world
and his current marks and continued improvement should be good enough
to shatter any marks. For comparison, here are Mathias' all-time bests and
the new standards required for 1000 points:
MATIIIAS STANDARDS
BROAD JUMP :10.8 .10.65
100 METER 23' 3%" 24' lO'/a"
SHOT PUT 51'2Va" 52'6"
HIGH JUMP f>'2<6" «' 5"

POLE VAULT 13'%" 14'3"
JAVELIN 182' 234'
1500 Meter *4:55.2 3:55.2
Only thing wrong with the new system that we can observe is that some
of the standards are way out of reach. Who ever figured that an all-around
athlete could ever approach the javelin mark or the 1500 meter or the pole
vault are a little off base. But Bob, with a little rest now and no other
troubles, should give the record books a good tussle.

the Card hurdle forces and missing strength in javelin and pole vault.
And SC is loaded in all these events except the javelin, and now could
easily score clean sweeps.
There is 110 question, in my mind, of the wisdom of holding Bob in
check. Why have him throw away the rest of the season? It doesn't add
up with so much in the future. Besides important meets with Oxy and Cal,
there are the PCC finals, the Nationals, and trips to Hawaii, and, of course,
the Olympics.
No one was more eager to get a crack at SC. Up until the doctors made
the final orders, Bob was all set to rest up his thigh and then compete.
But with so much at stake, there is no reason to risk aggravating the
cramped condition. In other words, we agree with the decision even though
most of us have never seen USC lose in a dual meet.
Mathias and Decathlon
Back to Mathias and his efforts to defend the decathlon title. Many
have bemoaned the revised scoring schedule that seems to be prejudiced
against Stanford's Bob. All the changes seem to cut down the most in
the events where he is the strongest.
What has been done in the new scoring system is to readjust the award
ing of points to more modern standards. The greatest improvements in
recent years have been in the field events, especially the shot and discus,
and the hurdles. Thus the standards have been raised considerably, making
it more difficult to hit the 1000-point perfection mark in any event. It so
happens that Bob is strong in the hurdles, discus, and shot.
What the revision does is reduce his world-record point total of 8042 to
a still good 7443, if he made the same times and distances under the new
scoring system. Bob Richards, one of the world's best pole vaulters and
Bob's main competitors, drops down about 600 points too. A man like
Albans, recently of Occidental, who is primarily a track man, gets reduced
only a little—from 7361 to 7102.
All the worry is silly. Bob is still the best ten event man in the world
and his current marks and continued improvement should be good enough
to shatter any marks. For comparison, here are Mathias' all-time bests and
the new standards required for 1000 points:
MATIIIAS STANDARDS
BROAD JUMP :10.8 .10.65
100 METER 23' 3%" 24' lO'/a"
SHOT PUT 51'2Va" 52'6"
HIGH JUMP f>'2<6" «' 5"

POLE VAULT 13'%" 14'3"
JAVELIN 182' 234'
1500 Meter *4:55.2 3:55.2
Only thing wrong with the new system that we can observe is that some
of the standards are way out of reach. Who ever figured that an all-around
athlete could ever approach the javelin mark or the 1500 meter or the pole
vault are a little off base. But Bob, with a little rest now and no other
troubles, should give the record books a good tussle.

Bob Mathias will only see limited action against the Trojans this Satur
day. That was the development after Bob suffered a cramp going over the
hurdles in last weekend's triumph over the Bruins. At the time, Jack
Weiershauser, Connie Jarvis, and even Bob himself thought that the trouble
would not be severe enough to keep him from competition.
Trojan Jinx —An Old Story
But it ends up to be the same old story. Everytime the Indians appear
to he rounding into form for the traditionally powerful USC track forces

something always pops up to ruin any slim chance of
an upset. Call it the Trojan Jinx or whatever you
want, but the Stanfords just never fare very well
against Troy.
Last season discus-tosser Ian Reed sat out the
meet and Bobby Bryan and Merritt Van Sant were
available for limited duty only. Bryan could only
gain a tie for third in his low hurdle speciality. Van
Sant, by some miracle, got off a terrific jump on his
last effort (the doctor only allowed three) and nosed
out Fred Flores for first.
If all that trouble with a long hospital list wasn't
enough, the meet was washed out and had to be
rescheduled. After being built up to such a peak and

wuii terrinc attendance expectation, the meet was eventually held on a
dismal, windy Monday afternoon. And the Cards got cleaned with SC
rolling up 81V2 points.
In 1950. a situation similar to the Mathias ache unfolded. Gay Bryan
was the versatile workhorse of the Indian thinclads. He was high jump
ing, broad jumping, hurdling, and running the sprints. But came time
for the USC meet the Gaylord did not appear in the Coliseum. He had a
badly pulled muscle. Later in the season he demonstrated his terrific
ability by scoring five firsts and 25 points against UCLA. But the Bruins
were weak and Gay just added to their misery.
Four other Card trackmen sat out the '50 meet. Van Sant had his bad
thigh that plaqued him for a lung time and distancemen Bob Barry, Warren
Ward, and John Kaufman failed to make the hard trip to the Southern
Cal slaughterhouse.
It all adds up to the sad fact that the Indians have not taken the
Trojan measure since 1933. That's riyht. El Troje has racked up 16 straight
wins over the Stanfords. But heck, we can always point with pride to
the good old days. From 1908 to 1925, the Indians chalked up 22 wins
without a loss.
The absence of Mathias is a real blow. For, if all the close events and
places had gone to the Indians, the score would have been nip and tuck
down to the final relay. But without Mathias, there is a gaping hole in
the Card hurdle forces and missing strength in javelin and pole vault.
And SC is loaded in all these events except the javelin, and now could

athlete could ever approach the javelin mark or the 1500 meter or the pole
vault are a little off base. But Bob, with a little rest now and no other
troubles, should give the record books a good tussle.

Bob Mathias will only see limited action against the Trojans this Satur
day. That was the development after Bob suffered a cramp going over the
hurdles in last weekend's triumph over the Bruins. At the time, Jack
Weiershauser, Connie Jarvis, and even Bob himself thought that the trouble

Trojan Jinx —An Old Story
But it ends up to be the same old story. Everytime the Indians appear
to he rounding into form for the traditionally powerful USC track forces

something always pops up to ruin any slim chance of
an upset. Call it the Trojan Jinx or whatever you
want, but the Stanfords just never fare very well
against Troy.
Last season discus-tosser Ian Reed sat out the
meet and Bobby Bryan and Merritt Van Sant were
available for limited duty only. Bryan could only
gain a tie for third in his low hurdle speciality. Van
Sant, by some miracle, got off a terrific jump on his
last effort (the doctor only allowed three) and nosed
out Fred Flores for first.
If all that trouble with a long hospital list wasn't
enough, the meet was washed out and had to be
rescheduled. After being built up to such a peak and

wuii terrinc attendance expectation, the meet was eventually held on a
dismal, windy Monday afternoon. And the Cards got cleaned with SC
rolling up 81V2 points.
In 1950. a situation similar to the Mathias ache unfolded. Gay Bryan
was the versatile workhorse of the Indian thinclads. He was high jump
ing, broad jumping, hurdling, and running the sprints. But came time
for the USC meet the Gaylord did not appear in the Coliseum. He had a
badly pulled muscle. Later in the season he demonstrated his terrific
ability by scoring five firsts and 25 points against UCLA. But the Bruins
were weak and Gay just added to their misery.
Four other Card trackmen sat out the '50 meet. Van Sant had his bad
thigh that plaqued him for a lung time and distancemen Bob Barry, Warren
Ward, and John Kaufman failed to make the hard trip to the Southern
Cal slaughterhouse.
It all adds up to the sad fact that the Indians have not taken the
Trojan measure since 1933. That's riyht. El Troje has racked up 16 straight
wins over the Stanfords. But heck, we can always point with pride to
the good old days. From 1908 to 1925, the Indians chalked up 22 wins
without a loss.
The absence of Mathias is a real blow. For, if all the close events and
places had gone to the Indians, the score would have been nip and tuck
down to the final relay. But without Mathias, there is a gaping hole in
the Card hurdle forces and missing strength in javelin and pole vault.
And SC is loaded in all these events except the javelin, and now could
easily score clean sweeps.
There is 110 question, in my mind, of the wisdom of holding Bob in
check. Why have him throw away the rest of the season? It doesn't add
up with so much in the future. Besides important meets with Oxy and Cal,
there are the PCC finals, the Nationals, and trips to Hawaii, and, of course,
the Olympics.
No one was more eager to get a crack at SC. Up until the doctors made
the final orders, Bob was all set to rest up his thigh and then compete.
But with so much at stake, there is no reason to risk aggravating the
cramped condition. In other words, we agree with the decision even though
most of us have never seen USC lose in a dual meet.
Mathias and Decathlon
Back to Mathias and his efforts to defend the decathlon title. Many
have bemoaned the revised scoring schedule that seems to be prejudiced
against Stanford's Bob. All the changes seem to cut down the most in
the events where he is the strongest.
What has been done in the new scoring system is to readjust the award
ing of points to more modern standards. The greatest improvements in
recent years have been in the field events, especially the shot and discus,
and the hurdles. Thus the standards have been raised considerably, making
it more difficult to hit the 1000-point perfection mark in any event. It so
happens that Bob is strong in the hurdles, discus, and shot.
What the revision does is reduce his world-record point total of 8042 to
a still good 7443, if he made the same times and distances under the new
scoring system. Bob Richards, one of the world's best pole vaulters and
Bob's main competitors, drops down about 600 points too. A man like
Albans, recently of Occidental, who is primarily a track man, gets reduced
only a little—from 7361 to 7102.
All the worry is silly. Bob is still the best ten event man in the world
and his current marks and continued improvement should be good enough
to shatter any marks. For comparison, here are Mathias' all-time bests and
the new standards required for 1000 points:
