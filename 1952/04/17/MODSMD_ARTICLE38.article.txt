# JV's Face Two Foes
## 
### 
Hoping to extend their two-game
winning streak, the Braves face two
strong foes this weekend.
This afternoon at 3:15 the jayvees
will tackle the tough Modesto JC
j nine, while Saturday morning at 10
the MoflFett Field Flyers journey up
I to the Farm.
Modesto is one of the leading
contenders for the Big Seven JC
Conference gonfalon, while Moffett
Field holds a decision over San
Diego State, which gave the Indian
j varsity two tough tilts.
Coach Dick Clegg will probably
! use two hurlers in each game, and
j may make his selection among

Dave Freeman, Ray Highsmith, Gil
Duncan, and Ron Boyer although
not necessarily in that order.
The Brave hitters are continuing
to pound the ball, although they
ran into a Tartar in Paly High's
Wayne Davis.
Still in their last four games, the
Junior Cards have blasted out 49
runs and 53 hits.
