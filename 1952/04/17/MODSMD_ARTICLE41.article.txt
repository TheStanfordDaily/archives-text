# Essegian, Goodrich, Chez Lead in CIBA Statistics
## 
### 
Stanford, at present tied with
Cal for cellar dweller in the CIBA,
has three men on top in league
statistics.
Chuck Essegian, long ball hitter
deluxe, is tied for the most home
runs with Ron Moberg of Santa
Clara. Each has tagged two oyer
the fence in conference play.
Essegian, however, has hit both
of his in the fabulous Sunken Dia
mond, where ball players just are
n't supposed to hit homers.
Since the field was laid out, only
19 balls have ever been hit out of
the park, yet five of them have been
hit by Essegian so far this year. If
he continues at his present rate, it
is possible for him to hit as many
this year as have ever been hit in
the past â€” quite a record for any
man.
Warren Goodrich, Stanford short

stop, leads the loop in hits with 11
in 27 times at bat. His .407 aver
age is fourth in the league.
In the pitching department, the
fabulous Joe Chez of the SC one
hitter is tied for league pitching
honors with one win and no losses.
As his only game was a one-hit
shut-out, he has a 0.00 earned run
average.
Rog Osenbaugh, Stanford's other
winning pitcher, has a one - won,
one-lost record and a 4.13 earned
runs per game average. At present
he is tied for fifth in the league.
In team standing, UCLA, al
though second in standings by half
a game to the Trojans, leads all sta
tistics with a .311 team batting av
erage. This is the first time in two
years that USC has been displaced
from top spot on the numbers sheet.
