# Crew Debut Set Saturday
## 
### 
The Stanford crew will make its
first public appearance of the 1952
racing season this weekend, with
the anual interclass races.
The seniors, sparked by four re
turning members of the 51 varsity,
hope to repeat the victory they won
in last year's 2,000-meter interclass
battle.
The class of '53 oarsmen, with
Crew Captain Ken Lewis and most
of last year's JV boat, were a close
second last year and could easily
upset the seniors this Saturday.
The sophs, who defeated the
Golden Bear yearlings last year as
freshmen, have shown up well in
practice and have an excellent
chance of winning the title.
The freshmen, looking good in
practice but without racing expe
rience, are the dark horses of the
meet.
The race will be rowed at 9 a.m.
Saturday at the Palo Alto Yacht
Harbor, at the end of Embarcadero,
past Bayshore. Frosh boatings are
not yet released, but the varsity
