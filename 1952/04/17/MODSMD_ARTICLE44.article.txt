# Sugar Ray KO's Rocky
## 
### 
CHICAGO, April 10 (UP) â€” Sugar
Ray Robinson came off the canvas
with a two - fisted roar tonight to
knock Rocky Graziano kicking in the
third round and retain his world
middleweight boxing championship.
It was a finish as surprising to the
record indoor crowd as it was to Gra
ziano.
Referee Tommy Gilmore counted
the one-time 180-pound king out at
1:53 of the round as Graziano lay on
the deck with his right hand on the
lower rope and his right leg kicking
in a futile effort to get it under him.
There was no official count on the
crowd immediately but the Interna
tional Boxing Club had sold tickets
enough to indicate a total attendance
of 23,785.
