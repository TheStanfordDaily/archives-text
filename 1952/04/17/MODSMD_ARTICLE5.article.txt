WASHINGTON, April 16 (UP) â€”
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's back
ers claimed today their New Jersey
triumph shows "nothing can stop"
the general, but Sen. Robert A. Taft
said he looks for a first-ballot vic
tory 011 the Republican Presidential
nomination.
The rival camps disagreed on
what it means in terms of New Jer
sey's 38 delegates to the national
convention. They were not bound
by the preferential voting. Eisen
hower boosters claimed 37. Taft
backers hoped to get six in New
Jersey and confidently counted six
more chosen today in the South
Carolina state convention.
A tabulation of 41!) delegates
chosen so far, allowing Taft forces
their claim of six each in New
Jersey and South Carolina and
giving Eisenhower the remaining
New Jersey 32, indicated a stand
ing of:
Taft, 212; Eisenhower, 115; Har
old E. Stassen, 21; Gov. Earl War
ren of California, 6; Gen. Douglas
Mac Arthur, 2; and uncommited, 63.
It takes at least 603 votes to win
the GOP nomination.
