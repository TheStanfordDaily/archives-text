# Students Picket Berkeley 'Scabs'
## 
### 
Ten Cal students picketed the Berkeley Telephone Building
Building last Friday. The "pickets" explained that they were pro
testing the action of other university students who had served on
switchboards during the current national telephone strike last
week.
The action came as a result of a hastily called "anti-scabbing"

meeting held last Thursday on the
Cal campus.
The Daily Californian claims that
Stanford students also engaged in
strike-breaking work last week. Both
men and women wearing red sweat
ers and jackets with Stanford em
blems were reported to have crossed
Palo Alto picket lines at odd hours.
At Cal, the "anti-scabbers" cir
cled in front of the striking com
munications workers carrying signs
and chanting slogans such as
"Number, please; we got your
number." The students picketed in
two shifts and the demonstration
lasted over two hours.
Another outgrowth of the Thurs
day meeting was the writing of a pe
tition-like letter of protest which will
be sent to the ASUC Executive Com
mittee, Panhellenic Council, the Ber

keley branch of the Communication.'
Workers of America, and East Bay
newspapers.
Frank Adams, secretary of the
Berkeley CWA - CIO, said that
there was no organized move to
recruit non-union help during the
strike.
"I am sure," he said, "that those
individuals who crossed the picket
lines did not carefully consider the
principles involved, and were not
deliberately doing this as a strike
breaking action."
H. M. Maddocks, Pacific Telephone
Berkeley district representative, de
nied another allegation of Thursday's
meeting, that the temporary help
were earning more money than the
starting rate for new operators.
