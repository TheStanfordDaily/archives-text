# Giant Flames Destroy House In Junipero Serra Road Fire
## 
### 
Flames spiraling 200 feet in the
air raged through an abandoned,
wood-framed farm house on Stan
ford campus off Junipero Serra road
and past Page Mill road last night,
causing an estimated $5,000 damage.
Stanford firemen were called to the
scene shortly after 9:30 and found
the building disolving in flame. With
in a half-hour, despite frantic work
by campus and Los Altos fire-fight
ers, the house's roof and walls had
crumbled.
The stubborn blaze, described
by Stanford Fire Chief John Mars
lon as the "worst in years," flared
unchecked as firemen were hamp
ered by lack of water.
With no hydrants within two miles
of the blaze, fire fighters relied on
tank-trucks which soon exhausted
their water supply.
Butane, escaping from a tank at
the side of the house, also compli
cated fire fighting operations as the
gas sent flames hissing skyward.
The eight room farm house was
owned by Stanford and leased to
rancher Joe Galentine who, ac
cording to neighbors, moved from
the building two weeks ago.
Estimate of the damage was set by

firemen after a hasty check of the
fire scene. A barn on the property
was leveled by fire a month ago.
Cause of the fire has not been de
termined.
The Stanford fire department
answered the first alarm but soon
called for additional equipment
from Los Altos.
Stanford students streamed to the
fire and two squads of Santa Clara
sheriff deputies as well as the Stan
ford police department and the
California Highway Patrol were
called to hold back the crowd.
