# Excom Hears New Chappie Constitution
## 
### 
Hammer and Coffin Society, pub- i
lishers of the Chaparral, submit
ted to ASSU Excom last night a
new constittuion including provi
sions to protect the magazine's edi
tors from bearing the full responsi
bility for Chaparral actions. The
constitution was tabled for the Stu
dent Manager's inspection and may
be brought up for approval by tele
phone poll today.
Society member John Motheral |
explained that the former Hammer ;
and Coffin constitution had become \
inoperative since its last revision in
1543 and needed changing to allow
for organizational alterations, con- I
stitutionai recognition of the Worn- j
en's Auxiliary, and clauses devel- j
oped since last spring's suspension
of publication.
Among the new clauses was on"
setting up an editorial advisory j
board which may rule on "taste, I
propriety, and decencv" of mate
rial to go in the magazine. The
I editor has a veto power over the
board's decision, and if he exer
cises this veto with the approval
of three-fourths of the members
j rf the society, he will be eon
i sidered responsible for the action
only as a member of the society.
Motheral pointed out that these
clauses were designed as a measure
of protection for Chappie editors,
32 of whom have been suspended in
53 years.

Cardinals Skip Irving and Mel
Butler reported satisfactory prog
ress on plans for Con Home Week,
May 5-10. Irving then asked Ex
com to comment on Cardinals' be
lief that a current lack of respect
exists on campus toward their or
ganization.
ASSU President Wayne Alley re
plied that Excom had made no criti
cism of Cardinals. Commenting on
last week's Daily editorial citing in
efficiency in plans for "Back to the
Farm" Week, Butler admitted neg
ligence there, but pointed out Car

of the possibility of using Lathrop |
