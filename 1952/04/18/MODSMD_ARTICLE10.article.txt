# Guest Conductors Announced For Next Year's Symphonies
## 
### RONALD ROSEN 
With tho retirement of Pierre
Monteux, the biggest question in
Bay Area musical circles centers
around who will be the next musi
cal director of the San Francisco
Symphony. This question, we
learned unofficially on Monday, will
have to go unanswered for a year,
as thy Symphony Board has de
cided not to name a permanent con
ductor for 1952-53, but will have
guest conductors for that season.
Guest Conductors
Some of the guest conductors have
already been named, and it is our
opinion that one of them probably
will be offered the permanent con
ductorship at the end of next season.
At present, George Szell, Leonard
Bernstein, Sir Thomas Beecham, and
Guido Cantclli are slated to lead the
San Francisco orchestra. It is a
shame that tho names of Artur Rod
zinski and Izler Solomen were not
mentioned, but their conflicts with
Columbia Concerts, which controls
most U.S. orchestras, leaves them on
the outside politically.
Cleveland Conductor
It is significant that Szell, the
present conductor of the Cleveland
Orchestra, is conducting in S.F. for
six weeks, a longer time than any
other guest conductor is scheduled.
Although this would seem to be an
advantage, it is both doubtful that
he would give up his job in Cleve
land or that the symphony board
there would be willing to see him
leave.
It is also doubtful that the brilliant
young American conductor-compos
er-pianist Lenny Bernstein would
accept tho post. I lis many activities
in Mew York and on Broadway pre
clude the possibility of bringing him
to San Francisco for even one full
season.
Sir Thomas' accepting the post,
however, is a possibility not to be
taken lightly. The great Englishman
has a tremendous following in the
Bay Area and numbers many in
fluential people among his friends.
Two obstacles are Beecham's health
and his possible reluctance to leave
England.
Watch Cantclli
Cantclli, Toscanini's protege, is one
of the best of the younger crop of
conductors. He is a fine, well
schooled musician and a tireless
worker. I lis performances with the
NBC Symphony and New York Phil

harmonic Orchestras were excep- j
tionally brilliant and received raves j
from audiences and critics alike.
Moreover, he is not holding a per
manent post.
Especially since it is unlikely that
the three other guest conductors will
be able to accept the San Francisco
job, Guido Cantelli is a name to
watch. It is our prediction that he
will be San Francisco's new conduc
! tor by the end of 1953.
