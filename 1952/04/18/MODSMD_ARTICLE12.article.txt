# Crest Hits New High At Omaha
## 
### 
OMAHA, Neb., April 17 (UP)
â€”A steady rain hampered dike
work late today as the flood crest
of the mighty Missouri River
neared the critical Omaha-
Council Bluffs area.
The rain was not heavy enough to
swell the flood waters, but Army
engineers said it was hampering
sandbag operations on the leaking
dikes holding back the straining
river.
On the Council Bluffs, la., side
soldiers and volunteers raced to
complete a secondary dike behind
one key flood wall which was in
danger of "disintegrating."
For this populous area of 355,000
persons the crisis of weeks of thun- I
dering water from the north was al- j
most at hand.
Crest Highest in History
The predicted crest was 31.5 feet,
more than 12 feet over flood stage
and highest mark in history.
Late in the day the river hovered
at. 29.8 feet.
The crest was reported to be |
moving slowly and might come late
tonight or early tomorrow morning, j
The rain turned the dike scenes 1
into slippery mud. Engineers said
it impeded trucks churning to the ;
levees with sandbags and slowed ;
the work of heaving bags on criti
cal spots.
Meanwhile the river, which with
the Missippi and other flooding
streams has made 87,000 persons
homeless and spread over 2,0000,000
acres of farmland, poured into low
lands and towns downstream from
Omaha.
Hundreds Flee
In Missouri it gushed over dikes j
of several towns and forced hun
dreds to flee.
Council Bluffs threw 500 more
men into the fight to hold its dikes
and asked for ''250 men hourly
thereafter."
The 12-mile-long dikes protect
ing the cities were built up two
feet above the expected crest, but
the critical question was whether
they could hold under the tremen
dous pressure of the river.
The pressure came from a river
swollen to 14 miles in width being
compressed into a channel 1,200 feet
wide between the two diked cities.
Soldiers, Volunteers Patrol
Constant patrols were made to
check on leaks and soldiers and
volunteers quickly plugged them.
At Council Bluffs railroad cars car
ried piles of sandbags to the fight
ing "front."
Some of the bags were hastily
fashioned out of ofd print dresses,
making a crazy - quilt pattern of
color on the dikes.
Engineers warned the crest would
last for 12 hours and that the threat
to the dikes would remain for three
days.
