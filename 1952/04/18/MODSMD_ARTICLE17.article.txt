# Trackmen Vie With Trojans
## Defending NCAA Champs Favored To Wax Cards in Coliseum Clash 
### DICK KLEIN Daily Sports Editor 
Univ. of Southern California's
Thundering Herd, track style,
won't be headed this Saturday.
But the Trojans will know
they've been in a meet after col
liding with Coach Jack Weier
shauser's Card thinclads in the
mammoth Los Angeles Coli
seum. SC should score over 70
points to rack up their 17th
straight dual win over the Cards.
There's little doubt that Jess Mort
ensen has the best track and field
team in the whole country. The only
question is how good and how many
points will they score in any one
meet or in the Nationals.
Stanford will probably score
more points against the Trojans
than any other team. But with
the absence of Bob Magee and
without the full service of Bob
Mathias the Cards have 110 chance
of making it real close. Normally
at full strength, the Indians have
enough overall balance to make it
very close. But not this weekend.
The big guns and National point
getters for SC are Parry O'Brien, a
55-foot shot putter; Jack Davis, de
fending champ in the hurdles; Sim
Iness, collegiate record-holder in the
discus with a toss of 182' 6"; Art Gar
cia, consistent distance ace; and High
Jumpers Klincheloe, Brombach, and
Ronquillo.
Strange as it may seem, this Trojan
jauggernaut has a few holes. The
javelin, middle distances, and pos

sibly the two mile are not too strong.
The Cards have a chance for 30 out
of 36 points in these four events.
Some really sharp duals should
develop. One again, the mile with
inspired Bobby Simon racing for
the Indians appears to be a close
one. Garcia will have to do at
least 4:l(i to beat Bob. especially if
the weather stays warm and nice.
The 100-yard dash will be a
blanket finish with Maury Parsons
getting the nod. Since Tulare Bob
will only work in the weights, he
should give his former high school
buddy a tussle in the discus. Sim
has the best heaves by far, but
never discount a competitor like Ma
thias. He can respond to pressure
'and exert plenty of it.
Jdhn Wooley, a product of LA
high schools, will give the home
folks a treat when he battles team
mate Wally McCamant in the half
mile. Warren Sanborn should come
home for the show to make it all
Stanford.
Newcomer Leo Long will lead
the Indian javelin tossers to a
possible sweep. If Leo gets off just
a fair toss, it will be good enough
for first. SC could gain some points
as the rest of the Card javelin men
are not much ahead of the next
Trojan.
After a short rest, Simon should
come back and win the two mile.
If he falters, frosh Bob Reed will
be good enough for a first. So far
this season, Simon hasn't success
fully doubled up in the two dis
tance events. But he did 9:19 last
season.

events, and an estimate of time, see
