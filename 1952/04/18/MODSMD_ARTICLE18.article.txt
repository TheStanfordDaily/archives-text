# Three Students Found Guilty; Fundamental Standard Violated
## 
### 
Three Stanford students were j
found guilty of violating the Funda
mental Standard at last night's
meeting of Men's Council. The i
"most serious" case considered was I
that of a Stanford student and three [
non-Stanford confederates who had '
broken into Hoover Library during :
spring vacation.
Removing a back window, they j
climbed into the tower and rang
the carillon. Attracted bv the bells,
police apprehended the four in the
building. The case was referred to
the Fundamental Standard Com- '

mittee and Men's Council.
Two hundred hours to he
worked off at the Con Home by
the four men was ths penally
assigned. In announcing the de
cision Drew Terramorse, Council
chairman, said, "In the eves of the
Council this violation seems to be
the mo t serious in intent and
because of possible damage to the
invaluable Hoover Library docu
ments."
The second case involved three
counts of Fundamental Standard
violation. Two Stanford men were
found guilty of illegally entering
the men's pool in the company of
two non-Stanford women, of being
intoxicated to the degree of being
irresponsible, and of indecency.
The two men were suspended
for one quarter, hut the penalty
was suspended and each was as
signed 40 hou.s at the Con Ilomr.
In his report to the Council,
Chief of Police Gordon R. Davis
emphasized the dangers of swim
mnig in an unguarded pool.
The third case was that of three
students who had galloped their
horses on the women's golf practice
field. Since there were no signs
prohibiting riding on the field and
since no damage was done to the
turf, the Council found the stu
dents not guilty of a violation. Ter
ramorse suggested, however, that
the students form a committee to
get rules drawn up and posted re
garding riding areas.
The Fundamental Standard Com
mittee is in the process of re-eval
uating the Standard. This Standard
places the responsibility of socially
accepted behavior on each student.
