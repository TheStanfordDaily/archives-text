# The 						'Old Boy's' Responsibility
## 
### 
Thirty-two Stanford Chaparral editors have
been expelled from the University in the past
53 years.
This fact caused some mild excitement at
the Excom meeting Wednesday night. Ob
viously, it indicated a situation in need of right
ing. And on the meeting's agenda was a rem
edy which shows definite hope for the future.
Hammer and Coffin Society, the private
group which publishes the Chappie, present
ed for Excom's approval a new constitution,
which includes a number of clauses designed
to take from the editor's shoulders the full
■brunt of responsibility when the magazine
falls under a cloud.
Under the new provisions, an editorial ad
visory board will be set up to rule on "taste,
propriety, and decency" of material to go in
the Chaparral. It can reject the material by a
majority vote. But its decision is subject to
the editor's veto.
It is here that the protection becomes specific.
If the editor's veto is backed by a three-fourths
vote of the members of the society, the editor
will then be held responsible for printing the
material only as a member of the society.
Besides preventing the placing of what is

perhaps an unfair amount of responsibility on
the editor, these provisions should prove a re
straining device when the magazine wavers
too close to the border of decency. They also
have the advantage of making persons who take
improper action on their own subject to dis
missal from the society and thus individually
responsible for what they do without the so
ciety's backing.
The clauses were added to the constitution
after last fall's suspension of publication. John
Motheral explained that the administration had
seen them and that though he had no written
guarantee that the University would abide by
them, he had been informed that future action
against the magazine might take such forms
as a fine against the whole society.
We feel that the publishers of the Chap
paral have made a desirable move toward
correcting an unfortunate situation. We hope
that should it again become necessary for the
magazine to be restrained, that the Adminis
tration will cooperate with the program set
out in the new constitution and not hold one
person responsible for action taken by con
sidered vote of a whole group.

Motheral explained that the administration had
seen them and that though he had no written
guarantee that the University would abide by
them, he had been informed that future action
against the magazine might take such forms
as a fine against the whole society.
We feel that the publishers of the Chap
paral have made a desirable move toward
correcting an unfortunate situation. We hope
that should it again become necessary for the
magazine to be restrained, that the Adminis
tration will cooperate with the program set
out in the new constitution and not hold one
person responsible for action taken by con
sidered vote of a whole group.

Thirty-two Stanford Chaparral editors have
been expelled from the University in the past
53 years.
This fact caused some mild excitement at
the Excom meeting Wednesday night. Ob
viously, it indicated a situation in need of right
ing. And on the meeting's agenda was a rem
edy which shows definite hope for the future.
Hammer and Coffin Society, the private
group which publishes the Chappie, present
ed for Excom's approval a new constitution,
which includes a number of clauses designed
to take from the editor's shoulders the full
■brunt of responsibility when the magazine
falls under a cloud.
Under the new provisions, an editorial ad
visory board will be set up to rule on "taste,
propriety, and decency" of material to go in
the Chaparral. It can reject the material by a
majority vote. But its decision is subject to
the editor's veto.
It is here that the protection becomes specific.
If the editor's veto is backed by a three-fourths
vote of the members of the society, the editor
will then be held responsible for printing the
material only as a member of the society.
Besides preventing the placing of what is

perhaps an unfair amount of responsibility on
the editor, these provisions should prove a re
straining device when the magazine wavers
too close to the border of decency. They also
have the advantage of making persons who take
improper action on their own subject to dis
missal from the society and thus individually
responsible for what they do without the so
ciety's backing.
The clauses were added to the constitution
after last fall's suspension of publication. John
Motheral explained that the administration had
seen them and that though he had no written
guarantee that the University would abide by
them, he had been informed that future action
against the magazine might take such forms
as a fine against the whole society.
