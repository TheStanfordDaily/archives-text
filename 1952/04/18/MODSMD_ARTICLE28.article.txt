## Daily Review of 'The Unknown Woman' Questioned 
### 
To the Editor:
I was surprised, to say the least, at the review of
"The Unknown Woman" which appeared in the April
17 (yesterday's) issue of The Daily. I certainly have
no objection to Mr. Fredell's expressing his opinion,
since that is his job—though I question the amount
of thought that went into this review.
My only concern is that Stanford students who
might enjoy the play may be discouraged from seeing
il by Mr. Fredell's remarks. Several of my friends

and I who attended last night's (Wednesday's) per
formance considered it an intelligent and imaginative
presentation of a rather complex idea (not simply
' that memories are what make life worth living").
I have no personal connection with this production
of "The Unknown Woman"; I simply feel that it is
a stimulating evening of theater, and I hope that
others will see the play and form their own con
clusions rather than accepting Mr. Fredell's judgment
as final. ADELE ORBORNE
