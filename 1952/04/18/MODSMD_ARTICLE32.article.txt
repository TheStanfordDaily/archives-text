# Sterling Gives Approval To Education Committee
## 
### 
After being informed that President Wallace Sterling's approval
of the Student-Faculty Education Committee by-laws means the
go-ahead for setting up the organization, Excom Wednesday night
appointed Ellie Rudolph and Everett Clark to hold interviews for
the four student members of the committee.
The interviews will be held Tuesday from 4:30 to 6 p.m. and

Wednesday from 4 to 0 p.m. in the
ASSU President's office in the old '
Union.
Excom Wednesday night also:
1. Heard a proposal from Pub- |
lie Relations Committee head Har- j
vey Segall that artists be made
available for $1 an hour to assist
groups making posters.
Men's Row representative Bill
Ford pointed out the problem of
picking the artists eligible to re
ceive the payment, and graduate
representative Dave Curry said he
believed it would be no more of a
problem than naming students to
other paying jobs on campus. No
action was taken on the subject.

2. Gave a vote of confidence to
the Stanford Daily.
3. Moved to submit Joyce Ballen
â€¢ tine's and Edwin Scarborough's
I names to the Student-Faculty Com
' mittee on Student Aid for approval
as the two new student members.
4. Appointed Bill Dickinson to
the Men's Sponsor Interviewing
Committee.
5. Voted Robert White a blanket
as his fourth award in gymnastics.
