# Faculty Begins Experiment To Improve School Planning
## 
### 
Stanford has joined 10 United States and Canadian universities
in a four-year experiment to improve basic planning for higher
education through increased faculty participation.
Faculty committees devoted to "educational inquiry" are now
being formed at each of the participating institutions. Professor

Graham P. DuShane of the Biology
Department is chairman of the
Stanford Committee.
Serving with Dr. DuShane are
Professors George Parks, chemistry;
Aurelio M. Espinosa Jr., Romanic
Languages; and William C. Bark,
history.
Oliver C. Carrnichaol, president
of the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching, an
nounced the plans for the experi
ment yesterday from his New York
headquarters.
He pointed out that "the struc

ture of higher education in this
country has developed much as 'the
house that Jack built'."

"As the basic intellectual re
source of any institution, the fac
ulty needs to participate more ac
tively in formulation of educational
policy. But in recent decades, their
energies have been devoted too
often to a single specialty or to one
field of knowledge," said Carmi
chael.
The program will be launched
next month with a two-day forum
on basic educational issues. It will
be held at Skytop, Pennsylvania,
and will bring together the various
institutions' faculty committees.
