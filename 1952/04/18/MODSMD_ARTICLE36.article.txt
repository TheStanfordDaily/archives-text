ford will be swimming to extend
their current win streak over the

all dual competition, is slated to be
accompanied by a host of slashed
meet and PCC records.
Only two Bears will offer much
opposition to the Card steamroller.
Jun Ross in the backstroke and A 1
Louderback in the 220 and 440 free
style comprise the aforesaid resist
ance.
Ross placed sixth in the NCAA
200 backstroke while Stanford's
Larry Heirn came in fourth. How
ever, Ross reversed matters in the
100 back by finishing fourth while
Heini failed to qualify.
Heim Should Win
All of which would favor Heim
winning today, except that Cal
Coach George Schroth has indicated
that he will swim Ross only in the
regular 200 in an all-out attempt
to beat Heim, who is also slated to
swim the backstroke leg of the
medley relay.
Louder back will push Bob
Thompson in the 220 and Pete Cole
in the 440 to hot races, but the
Cards should come through with

wins in their respective distances.
At Davis it will be a question of
Coach. Tom Haynie successfully

POISED FOR THE START—Bob Thompson, Card sprinter, will
be shooting for the Cal-Stanford meet record of 2:10.2 in the
220 freestyle today when he squares off against Cal's A 1 Louder
back at Berkeley. Thompson placed sixth in the NCAA 220, and
shares the PCC 220 record with teammate Pete Cole at 2:10 flat.
Stanford's swimmers will start off
what is expected to be another all

Tomorrow the Cards will travel
to Davis to compete in the third an

Cal Aggies. There they will be
heavily favored to defend their last

Go for 14 Straight
In the Berkeley meet today Stan
ford will be swimming to extend
their current win streak over the
Bears to 14 straight meets.
The accomplishment, which would
also boost to 15 Stanford's current
string of consecutive wins in over
all dual competition, is slated to be
accompanied by a host of slashed
meet and PCC records.
Only two Bears will offer much
opposition to the Card steamroller.
Jun Ross in the backstroke and A 1
Louderback in the 220 and 440 free
style comprise the aforesaid resist
ance.
Ross placed sixth in the NCAA
200 backstroke while Stanford's
Larry Heirn came in fourth. How
ever, Ross reversed matters in the
100 back by finishing fourth while
Heini failed to qualify.
Heim Should Win
All of which would favor Heim
winning today, except that Cal
Coach George Schroth has indicated
that he will swim Ross only in the
regular 200 in an all-out attempt
to beat Heim, who is also slated to
swim the backstroke leg of the
medley relay.
Louder back will push Bob
Thompson in the 220 and Pete Cole
in the 440 to hot races, but the
Cards should come through with

wins in their respective distances.
At Davis it will be a question of
Coach. Tom Haynie successfully
