# Card Nine Broncos Play Trio
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
A crippled Stanford nine will
take the field to.lay at 3:15 in the
Sunken Diamond against the high
flying Santa Clara Broncos. Tomor
row the two teams will clash again
in a 1:15 double-header at Santa
Clara's Washington Park.
The Cards will be waging a
despeiate light to stay within
range of USC- UCLA, and the
Brones in the CIBA standings.
The Cards should be in good
shape by next week and the
coaching staff figures that if Stan
ford can iust take two litis week
end, they will still be in the thick
of the fight for the CIBA crown.
Coach Everett Dean lias nomi
nated popular Joe Chez to pitch to
day's crucial. Chez showed his old
lorm and then some last Saturday
as he shut out USC with one hit.
Bob Murphy and soph fireballer
Phil Page will probably pitch to
morrow's twin bill.
Stanford's injury list is mammoth,
but dwindling. First basemen Jim
Agar and Olie Suzdalefl, second
basemen Art Abrahamson and Rich
Scramaglia, third baseman Dick
Cole, outfielders Owen Powell and
Chuck Essegian, and pitcher Rog
Osenbaugh are all hobbled with leg
injuries. All should be able to limp
into action this week except Osen
baugh and Abrahamson. However,
these six men will be slowed by
their injuries and their timing will
probably be affected by their long
lay-ofls. By next week, the team
should be at its sharpest.
Coach Dean, in summing up
Stanford's progress and future
hopes, says, "I've never seen a
team that wants to win more.
Because of this overwhelming de
sire, they often have beaten
themselves. The team knows that
when the injured players have
recovered, and we can get our
hitting, pitching, and fielding to
gether, we will finish strong."
In reviewing last week's games,
the genial coach especially praised
the professional play of shortstop
Warren Goodrich at short, and Jack
Shepard's filling in at an unfamiliar
first-base position while Agar and
Suzdalefl" were hurt. Dean also
lauded the more spectacular play of
Essegian, who has boomed out a
record-shattering five home runs,
including two in CIBA play, and
Chez, whose one-hitter was a sea
son high point. In conclusion, Dean
added, "Santa Clara is a good club,
but Stanford at its best can take
them."
The Broncs are a good and color
ful club. In CIBA play, they have
won three, lost two. Shortstop AI
Bertagna leads the league in hit
ting. He has pounded out 10 litis
in 17 trips for an amazing .588
mark. Second baseman Ron Mo
berg has hit two homers.
The sons of two famous Na
tional League first basemen play
for Santa Clara. Gus Suhr Jr.,
son of the Pittsburgh Pirate and
San Francisco Seal first baseman,
holds down first for the Crones.
Dick Camilli, whose father was
voted the National League's most
valuable player in 1911, pitches
and plays the outfield.
Camilli, who boasts a 2-1 record,
and Don Cole, with a 1-1 mark, will
be two of the Bronc starters this
weekend.
Washington Park is located right
off El Camino Real 12 miles, south
of Palo Alto.
