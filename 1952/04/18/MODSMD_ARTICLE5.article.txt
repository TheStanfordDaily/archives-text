# Ranch Blaze 'Suspicious'
## 
### 
Fire Chief John Marstor. reported
yesterday that he was "suspicious"
of the origin of the Wednesday night
blaze which destroyed a farm house
on Junipero Serra road.
He would not elaborate on his
suspicions.
The property, the old Aguire
ranch, has been the scene of two
major fires within a month, fire de
partment records reveal. On March
14 a combination barn and garage
was destroyed.
The house, Marston said, was a
"mass of flame" when Stanford fire
trucks arrived Wednesday. He ad
vised that the building was de
molished, making a thorough inves
tigation impossible. The Chief re
marked, "We may never know the
cause of that fire."
The building was vacated only a
few days ago by the William T. Fan
family, now of Barron Park. The
property was leased by Stanford to
Joe Galentine who in turn sub-leased
the dwelling to Farr.
The fire, described as the "worst
in years," was combated by Stan
ford firemen, aided by Los Altos,
Barron Park, and Santa Clara
county fire-fighters. Campus firemen
first arrived at the blaze at 8:30 and
remained at the scene until 3:30
yesterday morning.
Only injury suffered at the fire,
was Los Altos volunteer fireman
Richard Apcar who was slightly
burned on the hand.
