# Earthquake Hits Farm, Fails to Shatter Spirit
## 
### MARY MASSEY 
At 5:18 a.m. one sleepy week-day
morning, Stanford students were
suddenly jolted out of their beds.
Soon all campus roads were filled
with excited students trying to
break through the rain of falling
stones and plaster, while ear-split
ting crashes rocked the ground
under their feet.
It happened 46 years ago today—
April 18, 1906 —the greatest disaster
in West Coast history.
Memorial Church Destroyed
In the earthshaking 20 seconds
that followed, Memorial Arch fell,
Memorial Church was practically
demolished—its spire dashed to the
ground, and the twelve life-size
marble statues of the Apostles
around the altar destroyed. The
new gymnasium was ruined, and
the new library was hurled down—
with only its steel frame and dome
left standing.
Two lives were lost, seven were
injured, and $2,800,000 worth of
damage was inflicted, leaving the
campus a shambles. Students slept
outdoors that night, but aside from

a few tremors, the earthquake was
over.
By the following day, the damage
was discovered so great that Presi
dent David Starr Jordan suspended
classes for the rest of the quarter.
Stanford, operating on a tight
budget, was in danger of becoming
defunct, but Dr. Jordan had the
answer.
"We have often said that it is not
buildings but men that make the
University," the president said.
"Now is the time for Stanford men
to show that this is true."
Rebuilding Begins
The University set aside $100,000
for immediate rebuilding and be
gan restoring Quad classrooms so
school could be opened again in
August.

Hundreds of students miraculous
[ly escaped death. The floors of
Roble fell through, and the chim-
J ney crashed through the roof and
j lay straight across the center of the
! hall, but no one was hurt.
When the first shock was felt at
Encina, 300 scantily clad men
rushed into the corridors and out
side. Seven were dug from the de
bris, but only one life was lost.
Not a chimney on campus was
left intact, and not a building es
caped damage. Outer Quad was
completely wrecked in spots, but
hardly touched in others.
Chi Psi's Take to Tents
The Chi Psi house was the hard
est hit of the smaller living groups.
The house was thrown 10 feet off its
foundations and the floors torn out.
Chi Psi's took to tents as their
house was condemned.
In spite of the overwhelming
damage, the Stanford family had
much to be thankful for. If the
earthquake had come only a few
hours later when students were in
class, the story would have been
far more tragic.


20 SECONDS LATER—The ruins of the Univers'ty Library are shown after the devastating earth
quake that shook the campus 46 years ago today.
