## Truman to Decide CIO Steel Issues 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 20 (UP) —
Secretary of Commerce Charles
Sawyer assured the CIO United
Stcelworlcers of a wage increase to
day but said President Truman j
must decide the amount as well as j
the controversial union shop pro
posal.
His statement came on the heels ,
of a charge by Democratic Sen. |
Paul H. Douglas of Illinois that Mr.
Truman made "intemperate and j
exaggerated claims about steel !
profits on the eve of an expected
Senate showdown on federal funds
to run the seized industry."
While Sawyer mentioned no fig
ures, he is generally expected to
give the 650,000 steelworkers about
what the companies already had of
fered when government - sponsored
negotiations collapsed — 12V2 cents
an hour in wages and s'/2 cents in
fringe benefits.
The government probably will act
on steel wages Monday or Tuesday
—barring an unexpected settlement
of the dispute.-r-and the. industry is
geared to challenge the action in ]
the courts.
