# Students Involved in Two Major Weekend Crashes
## Four Hurt When Car Spins Over 
### 
Two Stanford students and two
Santa Cruz girls were injured in
an accident, in Santa Cruz Saturday
morning when one of the girls, who
was learning to drive, lost control
of her car, and the vehicle spun out
of control and was aecordianized.
Taken to the Santa Cruz hospital
but released after treatment for
minor lacerations were Stanforditcs
Alfred Reed Owens and Robert Lun
dahl Stilwell. One girl, Barbara Lee,
was seriously injured, suffering a
possible fracture of the hip and head
and arm lacerations. Vestal Emogene
Deatherick was released from the
hospital without serious injury.
Miss Lee, who secured her learner
driver permit less than a month ago,
was at the wheel when the accident
occurred. Witnesses say that the
car was traveling fast and was un
able to navigate a turn on the free
way leading to Santa Cruz.
One witness described the car
flipping "like a tin can tossed in
the wind." Police say that the car
apparently rolled over three times.
It was demolished.
Stilwell is a Phi Delt. Owens lives
off campus.
