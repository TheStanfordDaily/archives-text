## 
### 
Once upon a time there was an
Old Boy, whose business it was
to amuse poor, tired, and run
down Stanford students. This
year, l v careful and painstaking
research he has ferreted out the
best jokes, cartoons, and articles
from other humour magazines.
These he will present in the
Exchange issue of the Chappie, on
sale Wednesday. The mag will
sell at the four corners of Quad,
the Cellar, and the Office
for a mere 30 cents.
