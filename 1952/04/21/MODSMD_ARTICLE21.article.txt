# FEW TICKETS LEFT
## S.F. Ballet to Feature 'Swan Lake,' 'Parranda' 
### 
Only a few tickets remain for to
night's performance of the San
Francisco Ballet, to be presented by
the ASSU Concert Series in Memo

rial Auditorium at 8:15. The Bal
let Company will be accompanied
by 26 members of the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra.
Ballets to be performed are
Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake," one of
the most famous of all "white bal
lets"; "Le Gourmand," a classic bal
let consisting of a danced menu;
"Serenade," and "Parranda." "Ser
enade," conceived primarily as an
abstract composition, contains inti
mations of a romantic story set to
Tchaikovsky's 'Serenade in C for
Strings."
"Parranda" is a Latin American
"Gaite Parisienne." The Spanish
word "parranda" means "binge,"
and that is what the ballet is—a
prolonged gay binge, brilliantly
seconded by Morton Gould's music,
the Latin American Sinfonietta. A
fat colonel, dock workers, mulat
toes, pious ladies, a romantic
couple, and a vivacious confetti
vendor (and even some dancing
skeletons) unite in a carnival of
Latin rhythms.
The San Francisco Ballet Com
pany has contributed much to the
growth of modern ballet. Beginning
as part of the San Francifco Opera
Association in 1932, the Ballet Com
pany attained a separate existence
in 1398 due mainly to the work of
William Christensen, then ballet
master and now director of the
company.
During the two decades since its
organization, it has risen to first
rank among American ballet com
panies, being acclaimed by many as
second only to the New York City
Ballet.
The few tickets remaining are on
sale at the Concert Scries Office
in the Nitery for $2.50. $2, $1.50,
and $1.
