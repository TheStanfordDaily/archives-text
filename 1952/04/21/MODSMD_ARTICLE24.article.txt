# Trackmen Trounced By USC
## Trojans Win Easy Victory in South 
### DICK KLEIN Daily Sports Editor 
When it rains, it really pours. And the University of Southern
California followed right along with the weather of the fabled
southland. The Trojan track team poured it on for a nifty 90Vz to
40 Vz shellacking of the Stanford varsity.
Things were really bad in the big Coliseum on rainy Saturday
afternoon. The Indians were
blanked in only one event, the pole
vault. But after that, the picture
gets very dreary. SC allowed Jack
| Weiershauser's thinclads only three
first places the whole afternoon.
In piling up their 17th dual
j meet victory in a row over Stan
! ford, the Troians turned in some
sensational performances despite
the dampened condition of the
I clay oval. It was simply a mat
| ter of SC having too much in
events where the C&rds were sup
posed to be strong, and a little
bit in events where the Cards
! had nothing.
Outstanding was SC's co-captain
| Art Garcia. In a sensational mile
race, he trailed Bob Simon the first
three laps and then turned on the
heat in the final spin around. He
passed Bob and then kicked hard
the last 220 yards to open up an
11-yard margin over Simon. The
time was a sizzling 4:15.7.
After a brief rest the diminu
tive Garcia engaged frosh Bob
Reed in a dual for the two-mile
honors. Despite Reed's finest ef
fort of his life, a 9:25.7, Garcia
won by 25 yards. He was clocked
in 9:22.5. Considering the gooey
going and the grueling mile a few
events before, Garcia leaps info
the spotl'iTht as a real point-get
ter when the Nationals roll along
in June.
Defending National champ and
sure-fire Olympic star Jack Davij
did just what he was expected to
do. He won both hurdles. His time
was :14.6 in the highs, not near his
seasonal best of :14 flat: And in the
lows, no time was taken because
the officials failed to see the gun
flash through the mist and rain. '
On the credit side of the ledger,
Leo Long led the Indian spear
men to a clean sweep in the jave
lin.
Maury Parsons, the barrel-chest
ed Card sprinter, flung himself
across the tape to win the 100 in a
slow :10.1. In the 220 he could
only earn a third, but was only a
little over a yard back of the win
ner.
The pressure duel between Tu
lare Hich School's most famous
alums, Boh Malhias and Sim In
ess, developed and then fizzled.
Boh twirled the discus out a solid
167 ft. G in. to hla.st the meet rec
ord. On his very next toss, the
monstrous Iness heaved the plat
ter 17-1 ft. 7'/t in. Neither could
improve his mark after that.

When it rains, it really pours. And the University of Southern
California followed right along with the weather of the fabled
southland. The Trojan track team poured it on for a nifty 90Vz to
40 Vz shellacking of the Stanford varsity.
Things were really bad in the big Coliseum on rainy Saturday
afternoon. The Indians were
blanked in only one event, the pole
vault. But after that, the picture
gets very dreary. SC allowed Jack
| Weiershauser's thinclads only three
first places the whole afternoon.
In piling up their 17th dual
j meet victory in a row over Stan
! ford, the Troians turned in some
sensational performances despite
the dampened condition of the
I clay oval. It was simply a mat
| ter of SC having too much in
events where the C&rds were sup
posed to be strong, and a little
bit in events where the Cards
! had nothing.
Outstanding was SC's co-captain
| Art Garcia. In a sensational mile
race, he trailed Bob Simon the first
three laps and then turned on the
heat in the final spin around. He
passed Bob and then kicked hard
the last 220 yards to open up an
11-yard margin over Simon. The
time was a sizzling 4:15.7.
After a brief rest the diminu
tive Garcia engaged frosh Bob
Reed in a dual for the two-mile
honors. Despite Reed's finest ef
fort of his life, a 9:25.7, Garcia
won by 25 yards. He was clocked
in 9:22.5. Considering the gooey
going and the grueling mile a few
events before, Garcia leaps info
the spotl'iTht as a real point-get
ter when the Nationals roll along
in June.
Defending National champ and
sure-fire Olympic star Jack Davij
did just what he was expected to
do. He won both hurdles. His time
was :14.6 in the highs, not near his
seasonal best of :14 flat: And in the
lows, no time was taken because
the officials failed to see the gun
flash through the mist and rain. '
On the credit side of the ledger,
Leo Long led the Indian spear
men to a clean sweep in the jave
lin.
Maury Parsons, the barrel-chest
ed Card sprinter, flung himself
across the tape to win the 100 in a
slow :10.1. In the 220 he could
only earn a third, but was only a
little over a yard back of the win
ner.
The pressure duel between Tu
lare Hich School's most famous
alums, Boh Malhias and Sim In
ess, developed and then fizzled.
Boh twirled the discus out a solid
167 ft. G in. to hla.st the meet rec
ord. On his very next toss, the
monstrous Iness heaved the plat
ter 17-1 ft. 7'/t in. Neither could
improve his mark after that.

southland. The Trojan track team poured it on for a nifty 90Vz to
40 Vz shellacking of the Stanford varsity.
Things were really bad in the big Coliseum on rainy Saturday
afternoon. The Indians were
blanked in only one event, the pole
vault. But after that, the picture
gets very dreary. SC allowed Jack
| Weiershauser's thinclads only three
first places the whole afternoon.
In piling up their 17th dual
j meet victory in a row over Stan
! ford, the Troians turned in some
sensational performances despite
the dampened condition of the
I clay oval. It was simply a mat
| ter of SC having too much in
events where the C&rds were sup
posed to be strong, and a little
bit in events where the Cards
! had nothing.
Outstanding was SC's co-captain
| Art Garcia. In a sensational mile
race, he trailed Bob Simon the first
three laps and then turned on the
heat in the final spin around. He
passed Bob and then kicked hard
the last 220 yards to open up an
11-yard margin over Simon. The
time was a sizzling 4:15.7.
After a brief rest the diminu
tive Garcia engaged frosh Bob
Reed in a dual for the two-mile
honors. Despite Reed's finest ef
fort of his life, a 9:25.7, Garcia
won by 25 yards. He was clocked
in 9:22.5. Considering the gooey
going and the grueling mile a few
events before, Garcia leaps info
the spotl'iTht as a real point-get
ter when the Nationals roll along
in June.
Defending National champ and
sure-fire Olympic star Jack Davij
did just what he was expected to
do. He won both hurdles. His time
was :14.6 in the highs, not near his
seasonal best of :14 flat: And in the
lows, no time was taken because
the officials failed to see the gun
flash through the mist and rain. '
On the credit side of the ledger,
Leo Long led the Indian spear
men to a clean sweep in the jave
lin.
Maury Parsons, the barrel-chest
ed Card sprinter, flung himself
across the tape to win the 100 in a
slow :10.1. In the 220 he could
only earn a third, but was only a
little over a yard back of the win
ner.
The pressure duel between Tu
lare Hich School's most famous
alums, Boh Malhias and Sim In
ess, developed and then fizzled.
Boh twirled the discus out a solid
167 ft. G in. to hla.st the meet rec
ord. On his very next toss, the
monstrous Iness heaved the plat
ter 17-1 ft. 7'/t in. Neither could
improve his mark after that.
