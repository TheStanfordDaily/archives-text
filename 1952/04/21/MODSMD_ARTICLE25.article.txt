Expenditure statements must be
turned in by every candidate in the
ASSU elections before 5 p.m. to
morrow at the ASSU office. Candi
dates for ASSU president and vice
president are allotted $20, and all
others arc allowed $10.
These amounts must be budgeted
to cover the primary election on
Wednesday and the final election
April 30 in the event the candidate
remains in the race. The Wednesday
election will be the final one for
Men's and Women's Council candi
dates.
Candidates running for Men's
Council are requested to report to
the Daily Shack at 4:30 p.m. today
for election pictures. Each candidate
must prepare a 50-word statement
to be handed in at the same time.
Jack D. Fine was omitted in the
list of candidates last week. He is
running for Men's Halls Excom.
Paul C. Merrill, Jr., has not declined,
but is running for sophomore class
president.
