# Public Relations Com Revitalized
## 
### 
Public Relations Committee, often on the pan
in Daily editorials and elsewhere, is undergoing
a revitalization program that should make it the
important campus organization it was originally
intended to be.
Recent appointments have answered one of
the major criticisms of the committee, lack ol an
adequate staff. Director Harvey Segall will still
consider applicants and can still enlarge, per
sonnjbl-wise.
Equally important, a good number of worth
while projects are in the hopper for spring quar
ter. Some of these are already in progress.
A few of the projects are a social file, listing
places available in this area for holding social
affairs and listing available entertainment; an
activities booklet listing all campus organiza
tions and their functions; a file for reports of
previous activities, (drives, social affairs, etc.)
with; comments and suggestions to aid those
planting the activity the next year; high school
programs acquainting seniors with college life

through talks by Stanford students.
Meanwhile, the committee continues its gen
eral public relations work, making available its
poster service, advising campus groups on
publicity and general planning.
The committee is to be commended for ac
cepting criticism, some of it not constructive,
and striving to lift itself out of the rut in which
it has been mired most of this year.
There is little doubt it can perform a real
job. If handled properly, if adequately
staffed, and it conscientious, the committee
can accomplish a good deal in the way ol
inter-organization public relations, as well as
in the larger area of Stanford's relations with
the general public.
Now, obstacles have been largely removed,
plans laid down, the course charted. It remains
to be seen how well the plans will be executed.
But on the face of the revitalization effort, we
would say — the committee deserves another
chance. We hope it justifies the confidence.
