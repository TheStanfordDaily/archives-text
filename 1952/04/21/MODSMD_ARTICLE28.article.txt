### PETE GROTHE 
Ami This Is Stanford to Me

The girls in their pastel dresses and the boys in
their Hawaiian shirts, pouring out of their 10 o'clock
classes, looking like a flower garden breaking rank
. . . the games of catch and volleyball on the row.
Someone crying, "Just one more game, Bill," and Bill
answering, "No, I've got to study." But Bill always
ending up playing that "one more game."

An earphoned Music I student
listening to a record in the re
served book room and asking a
friend in a conspicuously loud
voice, "Is that the A or the B
theme?" And all the studiers
i buckling and the Music I student
turning tomato-red . . . Two law
students arguing a case on the
main libe steps and the contro
versy becoming hotter and hotter,
almost to the point of fists.

Two Kitms Head members philosophizing over
cups of coffee at the Cellar and one saying, "You
know, sometimes I feel sorry for those professors.
Those guys have to lecture a whole quarter to get
their applause" . . . The freshman who eases down
on the cool, sweet grass in front of the main libe,
opens his liio book to page 256, watches girls pass
by, gets up at (he end of an hour, and puts a mark
in page 250.
A boy sleeping in class, looking as relaxed as a
poached egg on toast ... A couple holding hands,
watching the sunset explode in the west, being re
flected in the freshly-ironed surface of Lake Lag . . .
An elderly gardener leaning on his shovel in front

of the Union on a cloudless spring day watching
couples pass by, and nostalgically wishing that he
were young again.
Lake Lag on a nice day, looking very much like
Coney Island at the rush hour . . . the student who
swears that he hasn't cracked a book all quarter
ends up "A"ing his midterm . . . the Friday afternoon
pilgrimmages to Rossots and the bustling gaiety there,
inspired by the completion of classes for the week.
The warm Saturday afternoons spent watching
the track meet and then the baseball game . . .
the freshman girl rushing to her class so she won't
lie late, passing slow-moving senior who smiles un
derstandingly and who mutters something about
"she'll learn" . . . the girl using every trick in the
book trying to talk her way out of a parking ticket
and receiving a pink piece of paper from a smiling
officer as a reply . . . L'Ommies on weekday nights
where studies are a taboo subject.
The harrowed-looking student, bemoaning the fact
that he forgot it was spring quarter when he signed
up for 19 units . . . Two profs walking down quad
and discussing Eisenhower and Taft, reaching the
Cellar, and changing the topic to golf.
The sundecksâ€”bodies, burning skins, and the smell
of suntun lotion . . . the jalopies sputtering down the
row ... a blind student taking long, confident strides,
coming to some steps, carefully descending them,
and then proceeding with long, confident strides
again . . . the "hello's" on quad . . . the classes, in
teresting and dull ... the drives to the beach . . .
the dances . . . the books . . . the good times, the
bad times, the study times, the play times . . .
And this is Stanford to me.
