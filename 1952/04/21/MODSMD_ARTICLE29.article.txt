# CAMPUS OPINION
## In Reply to Ledbetter's Labor Outlook 
### 
To the Editor:
Last week one of your readers, Stewart M. Led
better, voiced an opinion concerning the propriety
of your editorial on "Student Scabs and the Phone
Strike." I hope Mr. Ledbetter's apparent lack of
•ocial consciousness and seeming wealth of emo
tionalistic reasoning is not characteristic of Stanford
students in general.
It is difficult to reply to one who speaks so care
lessly of the "many undemocratic union activities,"
which "should obviously be outlawed as unconsti
tutional." It is even more difficult to answer one who
invokes the blessing of God to augment his arguments,
and ends with a plea for "everlasting freedom."

Therefore, I shall leave the task of rebuttal to some
one more experienced than I in the field of labor
management relations, a field which it is obvious
Mr. Ledbetter has yet to explore.
However, in support of the editorial which Mr.
Ledbetter labels as being "in poor taste," on the con
trary, I feel that it exhibited an attitude of informed
restraint which should certainly be praiseworthy in
any editorial dealing with a subject so easily given
to partisanship. Had reader Ledbetter exercised the
same degree of considered restraint found in the
"misleading" editorial he so readily attacks, perhaps
his opinions might have been as well-informed.
