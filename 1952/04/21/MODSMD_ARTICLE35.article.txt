# Graduate Women Enjoy Freedom of Village Life
## 
### RUBY BERNSTEIN 
Senior women and house presidents who attend the tea at Ster
ling Hall Sunday will have an opportunity to learn how 88 grad
uate women like life at the Village.
The Village, just seven minutes from campus, is one of the two
University-sponsored dormitories for the 297 graduate women at

Stanford. Thirteen live at Cubber
ley Hall; the rest live off campus.
Most of the graduates wouldn't
trade the Village for any other liv
ing group. Where else would one
have the opportunity to meet girls
from 12 foreign countries all the
way from France to Brazil? Twen
ty - two states are represented as
well.
Most important of all, the Village
offers "an adult form of living and,
above all, the freedom of being a
graduate student at Stanford."
This is exemplified in the way
the girls run their hall. In con
trast to the rules and regulations
imposed by the University on its
undergraduate women, the girls
at the Village have only to abide
by the Fundamental Standard.
They have no late leave slips, no
lock-outs, and no bonus forms to
fill out. The girls, however, must
register all their social functions
with the ASSU vice-president, just
as any other campus living group
must do.
While being an independent adult
group, the girls, nevertheless, have
a resident assistant. The HA this
year is Jean Logan, known as
"Mother Logan" throughout the
Village. Miss Logan is in her sec
ond year of graduate work at Stan
ford, but this is her first year as an
KA.
The house lias its own cabinet

of officers, headed by Helen Wol
die. Each Tuesday night the offi
cers and a representative from
each of the eight corridors plus
the resident assistant meet for
house council. The decisions made
by the group are referred hack
to each of the corridors. This
system works very satisfactorily.
Chiefly discussed at these meet
ings are the activities conducted by
the Village women. The girls have
a busy social program. This quar
ter they're planning a formal dance,
an all-day picnic, coffee hours and
exchanges with both campus and
Village men's groups. "There's any
thing but a lack of social activities,"
the girls say.
The girls also have an intensive
athletic program. Last quarter they
were in the finals ol' the women's
intramural basketball tournament.
And this quarter they plan to hold
tennis and golf competitions within
the building.
Sterling Hall was originally a
nurses' residence when the Vil
lage was an Army hospital during
the war. Until two months ago it
was known as just plain Build
in,*{s 121 and 1211. However, be
fore the end of winter quarter
the girls held a faculty tea where
they dedicated the building to
Mrs. Wallace Sterling.

by the Fundamental Standard.
They have no late leave slips, no
lock-outs, and no bonus forms to
fill out. The girls, however, must
register all their social functions
with the ASSU vice-president, just
as any other campus living group
must do.
While being an independent adult
group, the girls, nevertheless, have
a resident assistant. The HA this
year is Jean Logan, known as
"Mother Logan" throughout the
Village. Miss Logan is in her sec
ond year of graduate work at Stan
ford, but this is her first year as an
KA.
The house lias its own cabinet

of officers, headed by Helen Wol
die. Each Tuesday night the offi
cers and a representative from
each of the eight corridors plus
the resident assistant meet for
house council. The decisions made
by the group are referred hack
to each of the corridors. This
system works very satisfactorily.
Chiefly discussed at these meet
ings are the activities conducted by
the Village women. The girls have
a busy social program. This quar
ter they're planning a formal dance,
an all-day picnic, coffee hours and
exchanges with both campus and
Village men's groups. "There's any
thing but a lack of social activities,"
the girls say.
The girls also have an intensive
athletic program. Last quarter they
were in the finals ol' the women's
intramural basketball tournament.
And this quarter they plan to hold
tennis and golf competitions within
the building.
Sterling Hall was originally a
nurses' residence when the Vil
lage was an Army hospital during
the war. Until two months ago it
was known as just plain Build
in,*{s 121 and 1211. However, be
fore the end of winter quarter
the girls held a faculty tea where
they dedicated the building to
Mrs. Wallace Sterling.
Senior women and house presidents who attend the tea at Ster
ling Hall Sunday will have an opportunity to learn how 88 grad
uate women like life at the Village.
The Village, just seven minutes from campus, is one of the two
University-sponsored dormitories for the 297 graduate women at

Stanford. Thirteen live at Cubber
ley Hall; the rest live off campus.
Most of the graduates wouldn't
trade the Village for any other liv
ing group. Where else would one
have the opportunity to meet girls
from 12 foreign countries all the
way from France to Brazil? Twen
ty - two states are represented as
well.
Most important of all, the Village
offers "an adult form of living and,
above all, the freedom of being a
graduate student at Stanford."
This is exemplified in the way
the girls run their hall. In con
trast to the rules and regulations
imposed by the University on its
undergraduate women, the girls
at the Village have only to abide
by the Fundamental Standard.
