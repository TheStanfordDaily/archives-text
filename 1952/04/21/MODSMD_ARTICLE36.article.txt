# Prof Links Pituitary With Cancer

Significant facts tn the fight
against cancer were announced Sat
urday by Dr. Hadley Kirkman,
Stanford anatomist. Dr. Kirkman
has been exploring the function of
the pituitary gland in kidney can
cer.
Massive cancers were produced in
the kidneys of male golden ham
sters by the injection of estrogen, a
female hormone. A part of the pi
tuitary gland, the pars intermedia,
in the injected animals grew 1U to
50 times the normal size. In the
three animals which did not de
velop cancer the size of the gland
remained normal.
Dr. Kirkman concluded that this
part of the pituitary controlled the
growth of cancer in the kidney,
possibly by secreting an as yet un
known hormone.
Experiments indicate that a mol
ecule of estrogen combines wit!)
glucoronic acid (secreted by the
breakdown of food sugars), forming
a substance which may act in the
growth of cancer.
Natural estrogens and one syn
thetic kind produced the malignant
growth. Two other synthetic estro
gens had no cancerous effect. A
female hormone called progesterone
and a male hormone prevented the
development of cancer although es
trogen had been injected in the ani
mals. The treatment did not pro
duce kidney cancers in female
hamsters also.
Dr. Robert L. Bacon, now at the
University of Tennessee, also
worked on the experiments, which
were financed by the American
Cancer Society.
