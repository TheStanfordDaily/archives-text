# SWEEP AT DAVIS
## Swimmers Drown Cal 
### JIM MADISON 
Marehons!
The Card swimmers, unstoppable
on the Pacific Coast, swam to two
more overwhelming victories over
Ihe weekend.
They started off on Friday by
drowning 74 to 10 any dreams Cal's
"best ever" swim team might have
11: id for an undefeated dual meet
season.
Saturday the Cards swept the
hoards at Davis by winning all 11
events at the Third Annual Davis
Relays, sponsored by Cal Aggies.
They were defending champions.
Tne Bears put up a fight in only
one event, the backstroke. Here
Cal's Jim Ross hooked up in a ter
rific duel with Stanford's Larry
J leirn.
Ross went out like a streak and
;st the end of the first 100 yards
held a body length lead. But Heim
.stroked methodically and success
fully away and won in 2:13.2. Card
.Jolj 11 Weiser finished third behind
Ross.
Cal picked up its others seven
points with automatic thirds in the
1 est of the individual event*.
The Bears did, however, win the
JV meet 53 to 31 .
At Davis the Indian mermen re
wrote the record books and then
came home with probably a slight
feeling of guilt that they so utterly
outclassed the rest of the entrants.
Out of eight swimming events
they set new records in six, missed
a seventh, and won the other for
the first time it was held.
