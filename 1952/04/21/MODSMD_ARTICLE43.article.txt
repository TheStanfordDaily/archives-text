## Bob Murphy Tosses One-Hitter; Essegian (2) and Corzine Homer 
### MIKE HUDSON 
Stanford's baseballers jumped into the middle of the CIBA pen
nant fight as they swept a three-game series with the hapless Santa
Clara Broncos over the weekend. The sweep, coupled with USC's
two-out-of-three win over UCLA, left the Cards in undisputed
possession of second place in the league, a game behind the Tro-

jans. Chuck Essegian's two homers
and Boh Murphy's one-hitter on
Saturday were high-points for Ihe
Cards.
Friday's opener found the Cards
pounding out a 9-3 win over the
Drones. Climax of the game was
Essegian's long line-drive homer in
the eighth inning. The amazing left
fielder has now pounded out six of
the twenty home-runs hit out of the
diamond. All in all, Essegian col
lected four hits in four times at bat.
Early Lead
The Cards jumped of! to a four
run lead in the first four frames, but
starter Joe Chez momentarily lost
home plate and the Broncs closed
the gap to 4-3 in the fourth. Back
came Stanford with two in the fifth
as Essegian singled and Ilal Skill
man tripled to right center and
scored on a wild peg to home.
Chez singled home another score
in the seventh, and Essegian's blast
with Shepard on made it 9 to 3. In
hanging up his second CIBA win,
Chez only allowed five singles. Con
trol was his only problem as he
walked ten men.
Douhleheader
Saturday's double-header in Santa
Ciara's hatbox-like Washington Park
featured two thrilling games. Bob
Murphy showed his best form of the
year in the opener as he stopped the
Broncs with one hit.
The difference in the game was
one pitch. On that one pitch, Dick
Corzine whacked a three-run homer
to left-center and that was the I *11-
game as Stanford won 3 to 0.
Murphy Shines
Murphy struck out 1} and walked
only 3 in compiling his masterpiece.
A single through the infield in the
fourth by Bronc third sacker Ed
Chavez robbed him of a no-hitter.
The Cards could collect only three
hits off Dick Camilli, but they were
enough.
The seven inning afterpiece was a
wild affair that found the Indians
staggering in with an 8-7 win. The
Cards apparently iced the game in
the third with a five-run outburst.
Jim Agar and Warren Goodrich
singled, and Dave Rosenkrantz
walked. Then Jack Shepard hit the
left-field fence with a double and
the murderous Mr. Essegian hit an
other home-run over his favorite
left-center spot in the wall. Esseg
ian now leads the CIBA with four
home-runs.
Starter Replaced
The Broncs replaced starting pitch
er Dick Simoni in the third with
Frank Zasso. lie was greeted with
a two-run outburst in the sixth when
Agar got on by an error, Rich Scra
maglia doubled and Warren Good
rich singled. Camilli, who had lost

the opener, look the hill again.
In the seventh and last inning Ca
milli walked the one-two combina
tion of Shepard and Essegian. Shep
ard stole third and scored wliile (he
Broncs were throwing Hal Skillman
out at first. In the bottom of the
frame, the Broncs put two men out
with two on, but Camilli lofted a
fly to center field and had the du
bious distinction of losing both ends
of the double header.
