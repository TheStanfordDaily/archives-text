## Shows Poise And Interest 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
(Editor's note: The following
(ells of Queen Juliana's press
confercnce in San Francisco Fri
day attended by Miss Gompcrts
a Daily reporter herself of Dutch
descent. The Queen's San Fran
cisco visit was part of her current
tour of the United States.)
Her Majesty Queen Juliana
walked into the crowded Gar
den Room of the Fairmont, nod
ded to the women representing
clubs, radio, and newspapers,
seated herself, withstood with
aplomb the barrage of a dozen
cameras, poured a cup of coffee,
lit a cigarette, and settled back
to answer questions.
Queen Juliana showed interest
throughout the introductions and
asked occasional questions in a soft
voice with a charming Dutch ac
cent. "Is it really necessary to
stimulate interest in voting?" she
asked the representative from the
League of Women Voters. She
seemed surprised when informed
that it was.
'•Is there still a food shortage
in Holland?" the moderator of the
confcrcnce asked the Queen.
"No more," she answered,
j "thanks mostly to the generosity
of the United States. Many pri
vate friendships have sprung up
between our countries," she add
ed. "For a time, the school my
daughters attend (a progressive
public school) corresponded with
a school in America."
Her Majesty commented favor
ably on the dress of American
women. She herself was dressed
! simply in a green linen summer
| suit and perky white hat. Informed
that a Dutch correspondent once
had stated that American women's
slips show, she commented laugh
ingly, "I haven't seen any slips
! showing. Perhaps the women have

learned their lesson."
When the present American Moods
were brought up, Queen Juliana
remarked, "The Dutch are never
lax in keeping up our dikes. We
have to be on guard all the time,
or we would have no country left."
An emphatic "Yes, certainly," was
her reply to the question of whether
the United States could help pro
mote peace through President Tru
man's Point 4 program.
Helping displaced persons was
another point on which Her Maj
esty feit very strongly. Women's
organizations, she believed, could
"get behind the I)P's and help
them when they arrive."
The Queen explained about her
"youth conferences," get-togethers
held in Holland to find out "what
the young people ol Holland tliirik."
She definitely did not feel that the
Dutch youth is pessimistic. "They
have faith in the future," she re
marked proudly.
In the midst of the discussion,
the door of the Garden Room
opened. A man in a neat business
suit and glasses said, "Excuse me,
but I must collect my wife." Smil
ing, Prince Bernhard waited while
the Queen crossed the room, nod
ding to the women as she went.
The two walked out together, a
gracious, understanding Queen and
her husband.
