"Flood, flood!" shouted one stu
dent on seeing water bubbling up
through the asphalt on Escondido
Road by Cubberley last Friday.
The muddy water, which buckled
the pavement and overran the
nearby parking lot, was caused by
a break in an eight - inch water
main, the Corporation Yard an
nounced. It wasn't too unusual, as
the pipeline which is used for irri
gation purposes in the Encina-
Branner area "probably was one of
the oldest in the University."
Workmen immediately began re
pairing the pipe by welding a new
section in place of the broken piece.
Construction is expected to be fin -
ished today.
