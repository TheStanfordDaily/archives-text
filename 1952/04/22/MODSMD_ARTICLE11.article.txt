# Red Cross Blood Drive Opens Today
## 
### 
The Red Cross begins its two
day blood drive on campus today.
A mobile unit will take donations
from 8:30 to 5 on the main floor of
the Women's Clubhouse.
Students planning to give their
blood should not eat anything ex
cept fruit juice or coffee (no cream)
for four hours before the time of
the donation.
Over 100 morn donors were
signed up in the appointment booth
yesterday, bringing the total to over
500; but about 200 more donors are
still needed if Stanford hopes to
meet its quota of 700 pints.
Drive officials, because they feel
there are still persons without ap
pointments who wish to give their
blood, have decided to leave an ap
pointment booth open at the Cellar
today from 8 to 5. There are still
appointments open for this after
noon and throughout the day to
morrow. Persons wishing to donate
this afternoon, however, must sign
up before noon.
The entire process of giving blood
takes about one hour. This includes
a brief check-up of pulse, pressure,
temperature, and hemoglobin, and
having refreshments of coffee and
doughnuts at a Red Cross canteen
afterward. The actual giving of
blood takes about ten minutes.
