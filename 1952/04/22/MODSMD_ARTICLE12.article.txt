# Old Boy Digs Up Exchange Humor
## 
### 
The Old Boy has been heard to
say lately that he was tiredâ€”tired
of the grind, grind, grind. This
month he has spent buried in col
lege humor magazines, studying to
find the best of their jokes and car
toons. Now his work is done.
The Exchange Issue of the Chap
pie will be out tomorrow and will
include valuable information for the
coed about Men She Should Watch,
among other gems.
This issue, which has cost the
Old Boy so many sleepless nights,
will sell for MO cents at the four cor
ners of Quad, the Cellar, and the
Post Office. The Queen this month
will be Sherrie Cofley.
