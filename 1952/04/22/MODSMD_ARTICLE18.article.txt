tonight to the vast farmlands in the flooded valley of the gieal,
yellow Missouri River as a wind shift at Lacrosse, Wis., threatened
to send the mighty Mississippi in waves against its dikes.
Civil defense director Everett Woehrmann issued a radio appeal
♦for volunteers in the fight at La-

i crosse, declaring "our dikes face the
i most serious threat of any time since
i the Hood began." Volunteers asked
