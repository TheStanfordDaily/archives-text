LAS VEGAS, Nov.â€”A vast, na
tionwide television audience today
should have its first chance to sec
an atomic bomb in action, begin
ning at !) a.m., PST.
An ingenious system of four mi
crowave relay stations lias been
temporarily erected on mountain
tops to span the .'5OO air miles from
the explosion site at Yucca Flat to
Los Angeles, where existing na
tional networks (CBS and NBC)
will be fed.
The mountain peak stations were
established with the aid of a large
marine helicopter, operating at an
altitude 1,300 feet higher than its
ordinary service ceiling. A snow
iitorm wrecked some of the equip
ment Saturday, but new gear was
flown in yesterday.
