# Women's Council Candidates Give Platforms

### 
I shall work for clarification of
Women's Council's jurisdiction over
women's social regulations. 1 be
lieve education regarding the coun
cil's scope of activity is fully as im
portant as its tremendous job with
the sponsors in the fall and with the
Council Representatives throughout
the year.

I have been a member of Lag
wnita's Committee of Seven, Chair
man of the Committee of Five at
Eranner, and a sponsor. Two things
I would like to work on if clected
are: 1) more positive education on
social regulations for upper class
women, and 2) greater emphasis in
the dormitories on individual re
sponsibility toward social regula
tions.

Ignorance is no excuse! A Stan
ford woman is expected to know the
rules. Therefore, one of Women's
Council's chief responsibilities is ed
ucation. I am very interested in
serving as a member of Council to
help further tlicit- program of edu
cation; specifically, the integrating
of Council policies with those of the
living groups by stressing the im
portant role of the Council repre
sentative as an active policy making
officer in her living group.

An article in a national magazine
challenged us recently with the
question "Have College Women Let
Us Down?" I would contradict the
author, who answered "Yes." with
the evidence of the development of
Stanford's liberal social regulations,
student-judged by Women's Council,
in whose responsibility I would con
sider it an honor to share. As a
background to this question I would
bring a year on the AWS Housing
Committee and two quarters as a
junior sponsor at Roble.

Even more important than hear
ing eases is the prevention of vio
lations through education and pub
licity. If the philosophies behind
women's social regulations, the
Honor Code, and the Fundamental
Standard were better understood, I
feel there would be fewer violations.
These philosophies are determined
through the interpretation of the
council, and I would work to pub
licize these interpretations to you.

junior sponsor at Roble.

Even more important than hear
ing eases is the prevention of vio
lations through education and pub
licity. If the philosophies behind
women's social regulations, the
Honor Code, and the Fundamental
Standard were better understood, I
feel there would be fewer violations.
These philosophies are determined
through the interpretation of the
council, and I would work to pub
licize these interpretations to you.

I shall work for clarification of
Women's Council's jurisdiction over
women's social regulations. 1 be
lieve education regarding the coun
cil's scope of activity is fully as im
portant as its tremendous job with
the sponsors in the fall and with the
Council Representatives throughout
the year.

I have been a member of Lag
wnita's Committee of Seven, Chair
man of the Committee of Five at
Eranner, and a sponsor. Two things
I would like to work on if clected
are: 1) more positive education on
social regulations for upper class
women, and 2) greater emphasis in
the dormitories on individual re
sponsibility toward social regula
tions.

Ignorance is no excuse! A Stan
ford woman is expected to know the
rules. Therefore, one of Women's
Council's chief responsibilities is ed
ucation. I am very interested in
serving as a member of Council to
help further tlicit- program of edu
cation; specifically, the integrating
of Council policies with those of the
living groups by stressing the im
portant role of the Council repre
sentative as an active policy making
officer in her living group.

An article in a national magazine
challenged us recently with the
question "Have College Women Let
Us Down?" I would contradict the
author, who answered "Yes." with
the evidence of the development of
Stanford's liberal social regulations,
student-judged by Women's Council,
in whose responsibility I would con
sider it an honor to share. As a
background to this question I would
bring a year on the AWS Housing
Committee and two quarters as a
junior sponsor at Roble.

Even more important than hear
ing eases is the prevention of vio
lations through education and pub
licity. If the philosophies behind
women's social regulations, the
Honor Code, and the Fundamental
Standard were better understood, I
feel there would be fewer violations.
These philosophies are determined
through the interpretation of the
council, and I would work to pub
licize these interpretations to you.
