A bird in the hand is worth two
in flic bush, <>v is it'.' Lefty Wood,
a worker in I ho Con Home nursery
on Sunday, would like to challenge
this statement.
Early last Sunday Wood saw a
very large bird outside the window
of the nursery looking in at him.
The bird looked innocent and
hungry, and being persuaded that
he would like a little food, Wood
fed him several pieces of raisin

dent, yell leader, and the appro
priate Council representatives.

bread, never expecting to see him
again. However, this was not the
case.
The rest of the day Wood and
the bird wore inseparable pals.
The bird was very friendly, but
the only problem was that he was
too friendly. Nothing seemed to
drive him away. Furthermore, he
began to register his great affection
for Wood by rushing at him and
pecking him, a form of love tap.
This was enough for Wood; and to
frighten the bird far, far away, he
threw a few handfuls of gravel at
him.
The bird did go away for a while,
but fifteen minutes later, as Wood
looked out of the window, the
persistent bird was back again.

Only one solution was left—to
lock the bird up. Wood tried to
lure him into a tool shed, but this
happened to be the only place
where the bird did not want to
follow him. Finally, he decided
that food would be a definite lure.
Several pieces of raisin bread were
used and thrown in to the shed.
The bird did go in alter them and
Wood shut the door quickly.
This was very successful —at first.
However, the bird liked the shed
so much that he didn't want to
leave. As late as yesterday after
noon. the bird was still in the hand
and not in the bush. He seems to
be one of the few on the campus
who enjoy working at the Con
Home.

The bird did go in alter them and
Wood shut the door quickly.
This was very successful —at first.
However, the bird liked the shed
so much that he didn't want to
leave. As late as yesterday after
noon. the bird was still in the hand
and not in the bush. He seems to
be one of the few on the campus
who enjoy working at the Con
Home.
