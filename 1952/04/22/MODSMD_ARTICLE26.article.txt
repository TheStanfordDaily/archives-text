# Climbing Down From the Ivory Tower
## 
### 
Stanford is slowly but surely climbing down
from its political ivory tower.
Political activity —a goal lor which many per
eons have worked many weeks—is now well
on its way toward becoming a reality. The
Young Republicans supplied the match that
started the political fires when they asked for
ASSU Excom's approval of their constitution.
Excom turned thumbs down, but went to work
on another type of organization to bring political
information to campus.
Nights of committee work resulted in a set of
by laws for a non-partisan political club, headed
by a student-faculty board. The Board of Trus
tees made the organization possible over va
cation when they eased their ban on political
activity of any kind. President Sterling's ap
proval of the by-laws, required since both stu
dents and faculty will take part, was obtained
last week. Now the machinery can be built up.
Excom takes the next step today. Inter
views for the four student members of the
lop board will be held in the A.SSU Presi
dent's office from 4:30 to 6 p.m. and 4 to 6
p.m. tomorrow.
And this should give many persons the
chance to prove the strength of their con
victions. The persons who have appeared
before Excom and have written the Daily com
plaining about the lack of political awareness
on campus can now alter the situation.
Once the committee starts to operate, it will
bring speakers to campus, sponsor discussion
groups, and perform other services such as
supplying information about voting proced

ures. But workers are needed before any of
this can begin.
Undoubtedly, there will be a big turnout of
staunch party members. Excom expects no
dearth of Young Republicans and Democrats,
and to keep one of these groups from controlling
the committee, it included in the by-laws a pro
vision for political balance on the board. ,
But we would like to encourage the inde
pendents to try out, too. After all the committee
is non-partisan. It has room for those who are
seeking information as well as for those who
have made their choice.
We would also like io give a v/ord of caution
to the future board. It is easy enough to
imagine such a group splitting along party
lines. Much maturity will be reguired for
cooperation among people with strong ideo
logical differences. Much effort will be need
ed for these people to overcome the tempta
tion to make decisions on the basis of party
loyalty rather than on the good of the Uni
versity.
At one time Excom received much criticism
for not developing a more partisan political
structure. One reply the Executive Committee
made was that Stanford would need a restrained
transition into political activity, a completely
uncharted ocean. The hope was also expressed
that successful non-partisan work would event
ually evolve into efforts along party lines.
It will be up to the committee members
chosen from the trvouts today and tomorrov;
to prove what we firmly believe—that Stanford
students are easily capable of mature and in
telligent political conduct.—Dorothy Dodge

logical differences. Much effort will be need
ed for these people to overcome the tempta
tion to make decisions on the basis of party
loyalty rather than on the good of the Uni
versity.
At one time Excom received much criticism
for not developing a more partisan political
structure. One reply the Executive Committee
made was that Stanford would need a restrained
transition into political activity, a completely
uncharted ocean. The hope was also expressed
that successful non-partisan work would event
ually evolve into efforts along party lines.
It will be up to the committee members
chosen from the trvouts today and tomorrov;
to prove what we firmly believe—that Stanford
students are easily capable of mature and in
telligent political conduct.—Dorothy Dodge
Stanford is slowly but surely climbing down
from its political ivory tower.
Political activity —a goal lor which many per
eons have worked many weeks—is now well
on its way toward becoming a reality. The
Young Republicans supplied the match that
started the political fires when they asked for
ASSU Excom's approval of their constitution.
Excom turned thumbs down, but went to work
on another type of organization to bring political
information to campus.
Nights of committee work resulted in a set of
by laws for a non-partisan political club, headed
by a student-faculty board. The Board of Trus
tees made the organization possible over va
cation when they eased their ban on political
activity of any kind. President Sterling's ap
proval of the by-laws, required since both stu
dents and faculty will take part, was obtained
last week. Now the machinery can be built up.
Excom takes the next step today. Inter
views for the four student members of the
lop board will be held in the A.SSU Presi
dent's office from 4:30 to 6 p.m. and 4 to 6
p.m. tomorrow.
And this should give many persons the
chance to prove the strength of their con
victions. The persons who have appeared
before Excom and have written the Daily com
plaining about the lack of political awareness
on campus can now alter the situation.
Once the committee starts to operate, it will
bring speakers to campus, sponsor discussion
groups, and perform other services such as
supplying information about voting proced

ures. But workers are needed before any of
this can begin.
Undoubtedly, there will be a big turnout of
staunch party members. Excom expects no
dearth of Young Republicans and Democrats,
and to keep one of these groups from controlling
the committee, it included in the by-laws a pro
vision for political balance on the board. ,
But we would like to encourage the inde
pendents to try out, too. After all the committee
is non-partisan. It has room for those who are
seeking information as well as for those who
have made their choice.
We would also like io give a v/ord of caution
to the future board. It is easy enough to
imagine such a group splitting along party
lines. Much maturity will be reguired for
cooperation among people with strong ideo
logical differences. Much effort will be need
ed for these people to overcome the tempta
tion to make decisions on the basis of party
loyalty rather than on the good of the Uni
versity.
