# BULL SESSION
## Nothing to It 
### DICK McLEAN 
"There's nothing to it," you say as you sign the
hlank for an appointment time to give blood. "Noth
ing to it at all."
The slight-looking girl standing behind you in line
nods in silent agreement. She signs for an appoint
ment and then asks you, "Have you given before?"
"Yes, yes several times," you lie with the greatest
bravado. "Almost every week."
"Every week!" she exclaims. "But you're only
supposed to give every three months."

"Well . . . (Come on mind.
Work.) . . . Yes, the first week
of every third month. Just like
112 said. Every first week." But
the prickly redness creeks up
your neck and around your ears.
"What type of blood do you
have?" she asks.
You nearly say "red" but in
stead you stammer, "Oh . . .
oh . . ."
"That's nice," she says, I have

type 'O' too. I see that we have appointments at
about the same time. I'll see you there." While the
little coed jaunts oft', you eye her frame. (It's an
(.Id habit.) But this time you calculate that you own
about twice as much blood as she.
' Tuesday at lour o'clock," the appointment slip
-ays.
'I'lme like death, midterms, finals, graduation, and
the army creeps ever onward toward you. For
getting—that marvelous process which has kept you
from giving blood and remembering dentist ap
pointments on other occasions—doesn't seem to
function.
"Tuesday at four o'clock."
On The Morning you wake up disgustingly healthy.
Not a sign of a cold. Not even a sniffle. "Nothing to
it," you whisper reasuringly to youi sei! in the .mirror
as you shave. But you nick yourself and the drop
of blood on your chin turns your face as white as
the shaving lather.
Toward afternoon you begin to seek company for
Ihe ordeal. You find one fellow who'll come along.
( if you haven't made an appointment, they can
often slip you in.) "Will you promise me something,

Art, old friend?" you ask. "If I should faint or any
thing, you won't let them carry me out the front
door."
"Don't worry, lad. Your old dad will take care of
you," Art says.
At four o'clock you go down to the Women's Club
house. There's room for both you and your portly
friend. For a while you sit in one chair and then
move along to another. It's like musical chairs only
no one is left out.
You kid the nurse intimating that you're an old
hand at this giving blood business. She takes the
ribbing only so long and then slaps a thermometer
in your mouth.
"Humgt . . . Glurl . . you quip to your buddy
who doesn't understand you. You roll the glass stick
around in your mouth like the last piece of ice in
a drink. But you musn't bite.
From the temperature line you move to the table
for hemoglobin and blood pressure tests. "Are you
nervous?" the pretty lady in gray asks.
"No, not at all," you say cracking your kunckles.
She pricks the end of your finger and takes a drop
of blood. It's red all right. Then she wraps your
arm and takes your blood pressure. She takes it
twice. "Oh 110, you're not nervous," she cracks as
the guage bounces up to 2(H)." You should get a
cigar for ringing the bell."
"Will you follow me?" another lady says. You wave
a sad "goodbye" - to your blond buddy who's trying to
get a date with the blood pressure nurse. (He likes
older women.)
You lie down on one of the beds and take tight
hold of yourself to await the surge of pain. But it
doesn't come. The nurse touches your arm with a
novacaine needle. It barely pierces the skin and yet
deadens the whole area. If you don't watch, you
never know when the plasma needle is inserted. No
fuss, no muss, no pain. You're almost disappointed.
In about 8 minutes you're all through. You're one
pint of blood lighter and never feel it.
Over coffee and doughnuts with the other "veter
ans" and laugh at the frightened people who haven't
"given" vet. You haven't eaten for four hours so
the stuff tastes especially good.
"How was it?" someone asks on the way out.
"Nothing to it. Nothing to it at all." And you feel
glad that it's over and also something else. Almost
as if you'd done something important.

"There's nothing to it," you say as you sign the
hlank for an appointment time to give blood. "Noth
ing to it at all."

novacaine needle. It barely pierces the skin and yet
deadens the whole area. If you don't watch, you
never know when the plasma needle is inserted. No
fuss, no muss, no pain. You're almost disappointed.
In about 8 minutes you're all through. You're one
pint of blood lighter and never feel it.
Over coffee and doughnuts with the other "veter
ans" and laugh at the frightened people who haven't
"given" vet. You haven't eaten for four hours so
the stuff tastes especially good.
"How was it?" someone asks on the way out.
"Nothing to it. Nothing to it at all." And you feel
glad that it's over and also something else. Almost
as if you'd done something important.

"There's nothing to it," you say as you sign the
hlank for an appointment time to give blood. "Noth
ing to it at all."
The slight-looking girl standing behind you in line
nods in silent agreement. She signs for an appoint
ment and then asks you, "Have you given before?"
"Yes, yes several times," you lie with the greatest
bravado. "Almost every week."
"Every week!" she exclaims. "But you're only
supposed to give every three months."

"Well . . . (Come on mind.
Work.) . . . Yes, the first week
of every third month. Just like
112 said. Every first week." But
the prickly redness creeks up
your neck and around your ears.
"What type of blood do you
have?" she asks.
You nearly say "red" but in
stead you stammer, "Oh . . .
oh . . ."
"That's nice," she says, I have

type 'O' too. I see that we have appointments at
about the same time. I'll see you there." While the
little coed jaunts oft', you eye her frame. (It's an
(.Id habit.) But this time you calculate that you own
about twice as much blood as she.
' Tuesday at lour o'clock," the appointment slip
-ays.
'I'lme like death, midterms, finals, graduation, and
the army creeps ever onward toward you. For
getting—that marvelous process which has kept you
from giving blood and remembering dentist ap
pointments on other occasions—doesn't seem to
function.
"Tuesday at four o'clock."
On The Morning you wake up disgustingly healthy.
Not a sign of a cold. Not even a sniffle. "Nothing to
it," you whisper reasuringly to youi sei! in the .mirror
as you shave. But you nick yourself and the drop
of blood on your chin turns your face as white as
the shaving lather.
Toward afternoon you begin to seek company for
Ihe ordeal. You find one fellow who'll come along.
( if you haven't made an appointment, they can
often slip you in.) "Will you promise me something,

Art, old friend?" you ask. "If I should faint or any
thing, you won't let them carry me out the front
door."
"Don't worry, lad. Your old dad will take care of
you," Art says.
At four o'clock you go down to the Women's Club
house. There's room for both you and your portly
friend. For a while you sit in one chair and then
move along to another. It's like musical chairs only
no one is left out.
You kid the nurse intimating that you're an old
hand at this giving blood business. She takes the
ribbing only so long and then slaps a thermometer
in your mouth.
"Humgt . . . Glurl . . you quip to your buddy
who doesn't understand you. You roll the glass stick
around in your mouth like the last piece of ice in
a drink. But you musn't bite.
From the temperature line you move to the table
for hemoglobin and blood pressure tests. "Are you
nervous?" the pretty lady in gray asks.
"No, not at all," you say cracking your kunckles.
She pricks the end of your finger and takes a drop
of blood. It's red all right. Then she wraps your
arm and takes your blood pressure. She takes it
twice. "Oh 110, you're not nervous," she cracks as
the guage bounces up to 2(H)." You should get a
cigar for ringing the bell."
"Will you follow me?" another lady says. You wave
a sad "goodbye" - to your blond buddy who's trying to
get a date with the blood pressure nurse. (He likes
older women.)
You lie down on one of the beds and take tight
hold of yourself to await the surge of pain. But it
doesn't come. The nurse touches your arm with a
novacaine needle. It barely pierces the skin and yet
deadens the whole area. If you don't watch, you

"No, not at all," you say cracking your kunckles.
She pricks the end of your finger and takes a drop
of blood. It's red all right. Then she wraps your
arm and takes your blood pressure. She takes it
twice. "Oh 110, you're not nervous," she cracks as
the guage bounces up to 2(H)." You should get a
cigar for ringing the bell."
"Will you follow me?" another lady says. You wave
a sad "goodbye" - to your blond buddy who's trying to
get a date with the blood pressure nurse. (He likes
older women.)
You lie down on one of the beds and take tight
hold of yourself to await the surge of pain. But it
doesn't come. The nurse touches your arm with a
novacaine needle. It barely pierces the skin and yet
deadens the whole area. If you don't watch, you
never know when the plasma needle is inserted. No
fuss, no muss, no pain. You're almost disappointed.
In about 8 minutes you're all through. You're one
pint of blood lighter and never feel it.
Over coffee and doughnuts with the other "veter
ans" and laugh at the frightened people who haven't
"given" vet. You haven't eaten for four hours so
the stuff tastes especially good.
"How was it?" someone asks on the way out.
"Nothing to it. Nothing to it at all." And you feel
glad that it's over and also something else. Almost
as if you'd done something important.

"There's nothing to it," you say as you sign the
hlank for an appointment time to give blood. "Noth
ing to it at all."
The slight-looking girl standing behind you in line
nods in silent agreement. She signs for an appoint
ment and then asks you, "Have you given before?"
"Yes, yes several times," you lie with the greatest
bravado. "Almost every week."
"Every week!" she exclaims. "But you're only
supposed to give every three months."

"Well . . . (Come on mind.
Work.) . . . Yes, the first week
of every third month. Just like
112 said. Every first week." But
the prickly redness creeks up
your neck and around your ears.
"What type of blood do you
have?" she asks.
You nearly say "red" but in
stead you stammer, "Oh . . .
oh . . ."
"That's nice," she says, I have

type 'O' too. I see that we have appointments at
about the same time. I'll see you there." While the
little coed jaunts oft', you eye her frame. (It's an
(.Id habit.) But this time you calculate that you own
about twice as much blood as she.
' Tuesday at lour o'clock," the appointment slip
-ays.
'I'lme like death, midterms, finals, graduation, and
the army creeps ever onward toward you. For
getting—that marvelous process which has kept you
from giving blood and remembering dentist ap
pointments on other occasions—doesn't seem to
function.
"Tuesday at four o'clock."
On The Morning you wake up disgustingly healthy.
Not a sign of a cold. Not even a sniffle. "Nothing to
it," you whisper reasuringly to youi sei! in the .mirror
as you shave. But you nick yourself and the drop
of blood on your chin turns your face as white as
the shaving lather.
Toward afternoon you begin to seek company for
Ihe ordeal. You find one fellow who'll come along.
( if you haven't made an appointment, they can
often slip you in.) "Will you promise me something,

Art, old friend?" you ask. "If I should faint or any
thing, you won't let them carry me out the front
door."
"Don't worry, lad. Your old dad will take care of
you," Art says.
At four o'clock you go down to the Women's Club
house. There's room for both you and your portly
friend. For a while you sit in one chair and then
move along to another. It's like musical chairs only
no one is left out.
You kid the nurse intimating that you're an old
hand at this giving blood business. She takes the
ribbing only so long and then slaps a thermometer
in your mouth.
"Humgt . . . Glurl . . you quip to your buddy
who doesn't understand you. You roll the glass stick
around in your mouth like the last piece of ice in
a drink. But you musn't bite.
From the temperature line you move to the table
for hemoglobin and blood pressure tests. "Are you
nervous?" the pretty lady in gray asks.
"No, not at all," you say cracking your kunckles.
She pricks the end of your finger and takes a drop
of blood. It's red all right. Then she wraps your
