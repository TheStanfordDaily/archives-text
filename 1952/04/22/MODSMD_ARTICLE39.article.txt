# Railroad's Oldest Engine Has Hope for New Life
## 
### JOANNE WALKER 
California's oldest locomotive, the "Governor Stanford," v/as a
dashing engine in its red and yellow paint when, to a 35-gun salute,
it made its first run from Sacramento in 1863.
New, however, sitting in the Stanford Museum among ancient
Greek and Egyptian vases, it resembles a big black monster in a

I china shop.
With this in mind, the Museum
i and the Central Pacific have de
! eided to restore it to at least some
of its former glory, and they are
asking any Stanford students who
j are interested in old trains to help.
The "Governor Stanford," Cen
tral Pacific's locomotive No. 1,
{ was built in 18(>!! by Richard Mor
i ris and Son in Philadelphia and
[ shipped to San Francisco by way
j of the Horn in the sailing ship
| "Herald of the Morning." Leland
i Stanford was then pvesident of
# 1
I the railroad as well as Governor
! of the state, and the engine was
named after him.
The engine itself has 16x22-inch
j cylinders, 54 - inch drivers, and
j weighs 5G.000 pounds. For 30 years
it was used as a switch engine and
for local work (it was too light for
road work) until, in 1894, it was re
stored to a semblance of its origi
nal appearance and placed in the
Stanford University Museum.
; Since that time it has remained
I in the Museum—a sort of white
elephant that no one knows what
I to do with. The Central Pacific
I doesn't want it back because it
would mean finding a special
building to protect it from C'al
students, for whom it would make
, a perfect target.
JBut, because of a ccrtain fondness
I for the old monster, the railroad has
| offered to supply the paints, parts,
I original plans, and an engineer to
j oversee the work of restoring it if
j Stanford will supply the labor.
The Museum thought, with the
interest which has been shown in
• the old engine by the students

here, that before hiring outside
labor it would give those stu
dents a chance to work on it.
Those who are interested may
contact Mrs. Helen Cross either al
the Art Gallery or at the Museum.
