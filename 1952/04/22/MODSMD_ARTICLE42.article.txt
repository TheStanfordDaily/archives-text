# Spring Football Starts; Platoon System in Doubt
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Ono hundred and twenty-five athletes who would have pre
ferred to be swimming labored under Chuck Taylor's watchful
eye in the first day of spring practice yesterday.
"No platoons" is the theme of this year's spring practice. Taylor
will have his charges learn both offense and defense. Then, at

tiio conclusion of the workouts, the
crouching staff will decide whether
enough material is; available for the
platoon system next fall.
It is expected that at least several
players will have to go both ways,
notably end Ron Eadie and guard
Norm Manoogian.
The coaching staff didn't single
out any junior college transfers, but
they were happy that St. Mary's
transfer Len Mayrhofer was in the
fold. Mayrhofer, who tips the scales
lit 205 pounds, was first string tackle
under Joe Ruetz at St. Mary's as a
.'( ph. Mayrhofer was stationed at
guard yesterday, but he can also play
center and tackle.

Dave Castellucci, a promising de
fensive half last season, was work
ing out at quarterback and was look
ing smooth, considering it was the
first day of practice. Castellucci
played the signal-calling spot in
high school.
Among those missing at practice
were fullbacks Chuck Essegian, Bob
Mathias, half Bobby Thompson, and
15 other athletes who are participa
ting in spring sports. Among those
missing who could help considerably
next fall is basketballer-trackman
Don Carlson. Another trackman,
end Bill Storum, may .pass up his
final year of eligibility.
The familiar duo of Gary Kerkor
ian and Bill McColl were on hand,
but, unhappily for Chuck Taylor,
they will be wearing the grid knick
erbockers of professional football
teams next year. Kerk and Bill were
just getting in shape and giving a
few pointers to players.
The team was given a few plays
and did some light contact work, but
the bulk of the first session, which
lasted from 3:30 to 5:30, was devoted
to getting in shape.
Under the new conference ruling,
which has reduced the length of
spring practice, the squad will work
out for 20 days spread over a period
of four weeks.
