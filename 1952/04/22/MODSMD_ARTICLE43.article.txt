# Phi Kaps Triumph
## 
### 
Behind Tom Randolph's stellar
pitching the Phi Kaps blasted AKL,
24-3, in mural baseball yesterday.
Randolph allowed but six hits, and
came within one blow of a shut
out in the abbreviated three-inning
< . Lest. A first-inning home run by
.Tuck Peters with two mates aboard
ripened and closed the AKL scoring.
The Phi Kaps were meanwhile
knocking out 20 hits, mostly for !
extra bases, and taking advantage
oi' nine defensive errors to dent the
scoring column with five runs in the
iir.st inning, 16 in the second, and
three more in the third. The big i
blow was a three-run homer by j
Roy Deft'ebach in the second.
The big second inning cinched the j
contest for the Phi Kaps as they
La tied around twice, one player
batting three times. The 1G runs |
came on 12 hits, aided by alert base
running and four errors.
