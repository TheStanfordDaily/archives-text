### PHIL BERMAN 
The booming bat of right-fielder
Terry Evans continued to beat out
j tattoo yesterday, as the Stanford
Braves recorded their sixth victory
in a row, trouncing Commerce High
1(5 to 3.
Bi<( Terry had the distinction of
knocking the 21st home run out of
the Sunken Diamond as he walloped
;i three run blast in the bottom of the
first inning. It was the first time
in Stanford history the barrier has
ever been cleared in a Jayvee or
Fi-osh contest. Terry next came up
with the bags loaded iri the home
half of the second and proceeded to
blast a triple to the deep confines of
center field. This sent the Braves off
winging again and before they could
be put out a total of five runs had
rolled over the plate.
Starter Elton Kirkwood retired in
the bottom of the third and Nick
Ford, his relief, was promptly greeted
with a six run blast. The Braves
eased up after that and added but
two more tallies in their last three
at bats.
Behind all this cannonading, Gil
Duncan, Don DeLong, and Stan
Fetterman were having an easy time.
They scattered four harmless singles,
and only wildness allowed the Com
merce runner to sneak over.
All told, the Braves collected only
nine safe blows, but nine walks and
seven errors helped give them their
big bulge.

In a contest played Saturday morn
ing at the Sunken Diamond, the
Braves got some fine pitching from
Dave Freeman and Ray Highsmith
to down Moffett Field, 3 to 1.

nings and allowed no runs and four
singles. Southpaw Highsmith took
over in the sixth and allowed one
tally through lack of control and
then settled down to blank the Sailor
nine.
The Braves scored single runs in
the third, fifth and eighth frames.
A porous Flyer infield booted the
ball six times and allowed the Junior
Cards their tallies. Big blow in the
fray was stroked by catcher Len

The booming bat of right-fielder
Terry Evans continued to beat out
j tattoo yesterday, as the Stanford
Braves recorded their sixth victory
in a row, trouncing Commerce High
1(5 to 3.
Bi<( Terry had the distinction of
knocking the 21st home run out of
the Sunken Diamond as he walloped
;i three run blast in the bottom of the
first inning. It was the first time
in Stanford history the barrier has
ever been cleared in a Jayvee or
Fi-osh contest. Terry next came up
with the bags loaded iri the home
half of the second and proceeded to
blast a triple to the deep confines of
center field. This sent the Braves off
winging again and before they could
be put out a total of five runs had
rolled over the plate.
Starter Elton Kirkwood retired in
the bottom of the third and Nick
Ford, his relief, was promptly greeted
with a six run blast. The Braves
eased up after that and added but
two more tallies in their last three
at bats.
Behind all this cannonading, Gil
Duncan, Don DeLong, and Stan
Fetterman were having an easy time.
They scattered four harmless singles,
and only wildness allowed the Com
merce runner to sneak over.
All told, the Braves collected only
nine safe blows, but nine walks and
seven errors helped give them their
big bulge.
