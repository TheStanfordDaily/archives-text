# Scholar Compares Berlin to Farm; Romance Difficult in Germany
## 
### BARBARA TUERK 
The small bright-cheeked girl
lolled in the sun on a Union
Court bench, and mused about
the differences between her for
mer and present universities.
"If we were in Berlin," she
speculated, "we'd probably be
talking about the cost-of-living,

and how to get the most for our
80 marks—that's $20 —a month,
where the best markets are or
what materials are most lasting.
But Spring Sings or Water Car
nival floats!! Unfortunately, we
can never think about things like
that."
The girl, Hella Reglin, is an ASSU
Foreign Scholar from the Free Uni
versity of Berlin, which Stanford
graduate Phil Nielsen is now attend
ing on a student exchange.
Stanford Casual
Looking down at her bobby .sox,
she marvelled at the casual way in
which Stanford students dress and
continued her comparisons. At the
Free University of Berlin student
faculty relations are extremely for
mal. There is more out-of-class con
tact with professors than at most
European universities, but only be
cause it is such a new school.
Dating and parties are different,
too, the attractive brownette con

tinued. To begin with, almost all
parties arc formal, a fact which
caused quite a problem when clothes
were so scarce after the war. Girls
took to making their entrances
gowned ingeniously in curtains and
sheets.
"And romances are difficult," she
commented, "when boy and girl must
go home on the subway, parting at
their respective stations. Boys tend
to regard us as intellectual friends,
and to discuss politics and the sad
job outlook with us on dates."

Seriyus dating is liimted anyway
by economic conditions which make
it impossible for most students to
marry before they are several years
out of school.
A law major in Germany, Hella
is working towards a master's de
gree in Political Science here. She
hopes eventually for a Foreign Serv
ice career.
Most girls in European universi
ties, she said, are preparing for a
life-time career. There, unlike here,
they cannot combine marriage with
a job. Because of the unemployment
problem, she explained, married
women are barred from almost every
kind of work.
Berlin students are extremely in
ternationally minded, the much
travelled student commented. Be
cause of their blockade experiences
with their Russian neighbors they
are much more suspicious of Soviet
intentions than most Germans.
"Democratic Sector"
"The Democratic Sector" which
Berlin streetcar conductors an
nounce when entering the Russian
sector, is, she inferred, a close-to
home example of Red rule. People
riding from one section of the city
to another must hide Western news
papers or risk an arrest for violating

a law for "preservation of the peace."
"Western articles might be aggres
sive, you see,' she explained.
But the Free Germans arc not
frightened of their position. "When
you are sitting on a powder keg,"
she smiled, "you know you'll be the
first to go. So why be scared?"
A native Berliner, Helia is proud
of her city. "We only wish that most
Americans would come to see us.
Because tourists have to fly in, they
mostly skip Berlin. Of all the tours
in Europe last summer only two
visited us."
Berlin offers a wealth of cultural
advantages, she pointed out. With
in its 30-mile radius can be found
opportunities to hear artists of all
nations — British, French, Russian,
Italian, German, and American —
from ballet to the Harlem Globe
trotters.

A native Berliner, Helia is proud
of her city. "We only wish that most
Americans would come to see us.
Because tourists have to fly in, they
mostly skip Berlin. Of all the tours
in Europe last summer only two
visited us."
Berlin offers a wealth of cultural
advantages, she pointed out. With
in its 30-mile radius can be found
opportunities to hear artists of all
nations — British, French, Russian,
Italian, German, and American —
from ballet to the Harlem Globe
trotters.
The small bright-cheeked girl
lolled in the sun on a Union
Court bench, and mused about
the differences between her for
mer and present universities.
"If we were in Berlin," she
speculated, "we'd probably be
talking about the cost-of-living,

and how to get the most for our
80 marks—that's $20 —a month,
where the best markets are or
what materials are most lasting.
But Spring Sings or Water Car
nival floats!! Unfortunately, we
can never think about things like
that."
The girl, Hella Reglin, is an ASSU
Foreign Scholar from the Free Uni

graduate Phil Nielsen is now attend

Stanford Casual
Looking down at her bobby .sox,
she marvelled at the casual way in
which Stanford students dress and
continued her comparisons. At the
Free University of Berlin student
faculty relations are extremely for
mal. There is more out-of-class con
tact with professors than at most
European universities, but only be
cause it is such a new school.
Dating and parties are different,
too, the attractive brownette con

tinued. To begin with, almost all
parties arc formal, a fact which
caused quite a problem when clothes
were so scarce after the war. Girls
took to making their entrances
gowned ingeniously in curtains and
sheets.
"And romances are difficult," she
commented, "when boy and girl must
go home on the subway, parting at
their respective stations. Boys tend
to regard us as intellectual friends,
and to discuss politics and the sad
job outlook with us on dates."
Dating Limited
Seriyus dating is liimted anyway
by economic conditions which make
it impossible for most students to
marry before they are several years
out of school.
A law major in Germany, Hella
is working towards a master's de
gree in Political Science here. She
hopes eventually for a Foreign Serv
ice career.
Most girls in European universi
ties, she said, are preparing for a
life-time career. There, unlike here,
they cannot combine marriage with
a job. Because of the unemployment
problem, she explained, married
women are barred from almost every
kind of work.
Berlin students are extremely in
ternationally minded, the much
travelled student commented. Be
cause of their blockade experiences
with their Russian neighbors they
are much more suspicious of Soviet
intentions than most Germans.
"Democratic Sector"
"The Democratic Sector" which
Berlin streetcar conductors an
nounce when entering the Russian
sector, is, she inferred, a close-to
home example of Red rule. People
riding from one section of the city
to another must hide Western news
papers or risk an arrest for violating

a law for "preservation of the peace."
"Western articles might be aggres
sive, you see,' she explained.
But the Free Germans arc not
frightened of their position. "When
you are sitting on a powder keg,"
she smiled, "you know you'll be the
first to go. So why be scared?"
