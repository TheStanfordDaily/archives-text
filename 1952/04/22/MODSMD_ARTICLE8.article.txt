# Senate Gives Censure Vote On Steel Funds
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 21 (UP)—
The Senate ignored a last-minute
warning from President Truman to
day and voted to bar the govern
ment from using any funds in a
pending appropriations bill to ope
rate the seized steel industry.
By a vote of 44 to 31, it approved
a Republican-sponsored amendment
which proponents hailed as a "vote
of censure" against the Chief Execu
tive. Opponents of the proviso said
it was meaningless because none of
the funds were earmarked to run
the government-held plants.
Still before the Senate was a
more far-reaching GOP proposal
which would forbid operation of
the steel industry with any funds
appropriated for the entire fiscal
year ending this June 30. This
would affect the salary of com
merce secretary Charles Sawyer,
government manager of the in
dustry.
The amendment approved by the j
Senate was sponsored by Sen. Homer
Ferguson (R-Mich.). The more re- !
strictive proposal was offered by Sen. !
William F. Knowland (R-Cal.), who |
said he would call it up for a vote j
tomorrow.
Voting for the Ferguson amend
ment were 33 Republicans and 11
Democrats. Only two Republi
cans—Sens. Wayne Morse (Ore.)
and William Langcr (N.D.) —joined
2!) Democrats in voting against it.
Mr. Truman, in an angry attack on
the Republican amendment, said
Congress should spell out rules for
handling critical disputes like the
steel problem which affect the na
tional welfare. He described the
GOP amendment as "negative legis
lation."
