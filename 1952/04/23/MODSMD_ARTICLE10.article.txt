## 
### 
Children playing with matches
caused an estimated $200 damage
yesterday afternoon in a fire that
destroyed a bed frame and mattress
at the John E. Naughton residence,
739 Santa Ynez Street.
Mrs. Naughton said that her chil
dren were playing with matches in
an upstairs bedroom and touched
off the blaze.
Campus firemen encountered dif
ficulty combating the blaze bccausc
of the dense smoke that rolled from
the smouldering mattress.
The blaze, located on the second
fioor of the large two-story, wood
framed building, could have been
dangerous, firemen reported. They
said that flames were leaping high
from the bedframe when they ar
rived and could have ignited the
walls of the house.
The first alarm was rung in by
nine - year - old Johnny Naughton,
who ran to the corner alarm box.
The alarm was turned in about 3:35
p.m. Firemen returned to the sta
tion within an hour after mopping
up damage.
Mrs. Naughton complimented the
student firemen and Chief John
Marston for their quick arrival at
the blaze. She said that "I had
hardly put down the phone when
the first trucks arrived."
