# STATEMENTS OF MEN'S COUNCIL CANDIDATES
## 
### 
Jack Butler:
As a candidate for Men's
Council my duty, if elected, will
be to try Honor Code violations.
It is a position that requires hon
esty, integrity, and intelligent
judgment, and I feel that my past
positions give me these qualifica
tions. I would sincerely appre
ciate your remembering my name
when you vote.
Edward B. Cook:
I am sincerely interested in be
coming a member of Men's Coun
cil. If elected, I will endeavor to
deal fairly with anyone appear
ing before the Council in regard
to the Fundamental Standard. I
ask for your support, and hope
that I shall not see any fellow
student at any future meeting.
Bill Fcvd:
In the past year as a member of
the ASSU Excom it has come to
my attention that Men's Council

has drifted away from the stu
dent body in general and the Ex
ecutive Committee in particular.
If elected I would see too it that
the Council is integrated more
into campus life.
Don KaulTman:
I feel that the job of Men's
Council is one of the most impor
tant jobs in student government.
Most petty violations such as
traffic citation appeals and Honor
Code violations are decided upon
by Men's Council. I believe that
I am qualified for the job after
living under the ride of the Hon
or Code for three years!
John KnnH/.en: No statement.
Walt Menningcr:
In the making of decisions on
Honor Code and Fundamental
Standard violations, if elected, I
would offer a considered judg
ment of the problems involved
tempered with an experienced

background in seeing men stu
dents' problems as a Daily staff
member and a member of Alpha
Phi Omega, service fraternity.
Bill Sanson:
I would appreciate the oppor
tunity to represent you on Men's
Council. If I am one of the three
elected, I will do my best to be
fair both to to student accu-ed of
an offense and to the student
body.
Bob Simon:
The candidates you elect to
Men's Council submit recommen
dations to the administration con
cerning violations of the Funda
mental Standard and the Honor
Code. I believe that in formulat
ing their recommendations the
Council should attempt to achieve
a suitable balance between the
welfare of the individuals in
volved and the entire student
body.

Carry G. Smith:
One of the main requirements
Tor a position on Men's Council
is a wide background of experi
ence in student affairs and in the
details and function of our stu
dent government. I believe that
my experience as editor of the
Quad and Public Relations Direc
tor of Activities, especially, qual
ify me for a position on Men's
Council.
Kill Stoltzc:
If Stanford's men students
should elect me as their Men's
Council representative I will do
my best to serve them honestly
and intelligently.
I feel somewhat qualified for
the job because I attended Men's
Council meetings for one quarter
as a reporter for the Stanford
Daily.
For Women's Council nominees'
statements, see yesterday's Daily.
