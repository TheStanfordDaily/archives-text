# Two-day Red Cross Blood Drive 'Running Smoothly
## More Donors Will Report Today 
### 
The Red Cross collected about u()0
pints of blood from Stanford students
and faculty members yesterday in
the first, day of the drive that was
described as "running smoothly."
Sign-ups for today total 230. Since

many more donors than this can be
accommodated, persons wishing to
give blood#who have not made ap
pointments will be allowed to come
in without them.
Donations will be taken on the
main floor of the Women's Clubhouse
from 8:30 to 5. Today is the last day
of the drive.
Persons planning to give their
blood are reminded not to cat or
drink anything besides fruit juice
or black coffee for four hours before
donating.
The donations that Stanford made
yesterday and will make today arc a
fraction of the amount of blood that
the Red Cross is appealing for. Blood
supplies are low in Korea and here
at home. To avoid the danger of a
complete depletion of reserves, the
Rod Cross must secure 1500,000 pints
a month.
Civilian response to the call has
been late and feeble. Americans j
have been giving about half the i
amount they have been asked for.
The students who walk out of the
Women's Clubhouse wearing the pins
of donors today can know that they
have helped change the public's in
different response to an overwhelm- |
ing one.
