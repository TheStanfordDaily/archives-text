# Election by a Minority
## 
### 
The voters who go to the polls in today's
primary elections will probably comprise less
than half the student body. Even less will vote
in the final elections next week if past per
formance is an indication. In other words, the
elected officials and representatives will be
chosen by a minority of the enrollment.
Voting percentages have never been par
ticularly high at Stanford.
A breakdown of voting by living groups in
the fall guarter elections (for Council and
class Excom representatives) reveals that 30
per cent of the student body voted in the
primary, 29 per cent in the general elections.
Obviously these are low percentages.
By divisions, the breakdown goes like this:
lower division, 43 per cent in the primary, 51
per cent in final election; upper division, 36 and
23 per cent; graduates, 8 and 10 per cent.
In general, men's and women's dormitories
had the highest percentages, and Row houses
and the Village the lowest. Highest category

for the final elections was men's lialls with 44
per cent voting.
Why the low figures? Probably the root
of the non-voting problem lies in a lack of
understanding and a lack of interest in the
machinery of student government. Such ac
tivities as the Y Workshop, candidate speak
ing programs, and Dr. Sterling's address on
April 28 can help improve the understanding.
Interest, these programs can invite.
Unless the interest and the understanding de
velops, elections for student government posts
will remain largely personality contests.
As we said before, interest at best can only
be invited. It cannot, nor should it be com
pelled. But it is inconsistent to develop post
election interest which manifests itself in
grips and complaints over "low performance"
in student government.
It is much more effective to elect the candi
date you want in the first place than to "make
with the moans" about the post-election con
duct of officials elected by a minority.
