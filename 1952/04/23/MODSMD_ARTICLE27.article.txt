# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
Several movements have started in various parts
of the country to get Henry Morgan back on the
radio.
And I am all for it.
Henry Morgan is undoubtedly the most refreshing
satirist to come along in many a year. Morgan has
had the nerve to do something no other mikeman
could think of doing . . . pan his own sponsor. He
lias continually done this . . . and he has continually
been fired . . . but he has had fun, and so have the
listeners.

Once Morgan was asked on jhe
radio what to do for falling hair.
His sponsor was a shampoo-man,
and the logical answer would have
been to use his sponsor's shampoo.
Did Morgan say this? No. His
reply was, "Merely step aside."
At another time, Morgan gave
the following commercial: "Re
member, ladies and gentlemen,
Shampoo brings out the
natural color in your hair. And

if you have no hair, it brings out the natural color
in your scalp."
Several years ago, Morgan's sponsor was a razor
lilade manufacturer. Now any razor advertise
ment (hat you've ever heard implored you, the
huying public, to get so-and-so type of razor be-

cause it made you look sharp, feel sharp, l>e sharp,
saved you shaving time, prevented five o'clock
shadow, made the girls go mad over you, ad infini
tum, ad nauseum.
Did Morgan use the old, trite arguments? No, not
Morgan. Here's what he said:
"I'm supposed to say that Razor Blades
save you shaving time. That's a lot on nonsense.
If you really want to save .shaving time, grow a beard.
"Now, these razor blades are supposed to save you
20 seconds of shaving time every day. I know a man
who uesd Razor blades for nine straight days,
thereby saving three minutes shaving time. He had
nothing to do with the three minutes that were left
over, so he went to the piano and played the Minute
Waltz three times.
"However, his piano playing was so poor that
two neighbors came upstairs and pushed him out of
the window. The fall killed the guy. Now, there's
an example of a man who saved shaving time, and
look what happened to him. No, it doesn't do you
any good, and as I say, if you really want to save
shaving time, grow a heard.
Morgan also did satires on sponsors who didn't
sponsor him. One of his classics was, "Remember,
folks, get Choco Chocolate Bars. Choco Chocolate
Bars are the only candy bars without wrappers. They
are handled by millions of dealers everywhere."
