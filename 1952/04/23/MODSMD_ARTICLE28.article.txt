# Phil Nielsen Meets Former ASSU Foreign Scholars

(Editor's note: The following is the first part of
a letter dated Naples, April 9, from Phil Nielsen,
ASSU Exchange Scholar to the Free University of
Berlin. In it. Nielsen tells of meeting several for
mer ASSU Foreign Scholars in Southern Europe.)
As part of my present Spring vacation trip
through a few other European countries, I have
had the pleasure to visit a number of our former
ASSU Foreign Scholars in some of the major
cities on my itinerary.
In Munchen I stayed several days with Fritz Mar
gulies (1949-50 Foreign Scholar) and his young wife
and new son. Fritz has been active writing articles
on current public problems for a local newspaper,
but at the moment he is devoting his energies to the
creation of a new youth organization for young
Bavarians—a sorely needed development. We talked
over Stanford experiences, and I was graciously shown
the sights of Munchen.
Joe Wiesinger, a member of the first group of ASSU
Foreign Scholars ever to come to Stanford, enter
tained me in Linz, Austria, and described to me his
interesting work in the office of the Federal Police
where he operates closely with the attached American
Army Criminal Investigation Department.
Now employed in the Political Affairs Division of
the Austrian Foreign Ministry in Vienna, Karl
Kisler (1950-51) was a most affable and charming
host. His Stanford year plus his internship this
past summer with the U.N. at Lake Success were
important reasons for his appointment to his pres
( nl post of responsibility. Through Karl I learned
(hat another of our former scholars from Austria,
Gottfried-Karl Kindermann (1949-50) is now once
again back in America as a protege of Professor
Hans Morgenthau at the University of Chicago.
In Athens I met Fotini Kaplanidou, ASSU Scholar
of 1949-50, who since her return to Greece has secured
on Instructionship at the famous "American School
for Gills" in Athens. Fontini lectures in the field
of Educational Methods and Psychology to pupils of
about 18-19 years of age. This is indeed a fine op
portunity and one in which it is possible to dissemi
nate actively in an experimental fashion to eager stu
dents information about America in a subject which
present-day Greece vitally needs that, is, modern,
western educational practices. Fotini is also a mem

ber of a drama society which is now touring northern
Greece to present to the public an insight into
American literature and theater works.
I hope also in about two weeks' time to see Hans
Rossi in Zurich, and I shall report to you later the
highlights of our get-together. It seems to me that
we may be proud of the useful and promising ac
tivities in which our former Foreign Scholars are
currently engaged. Such work is certainly contribu
ting in a direct manner toward helping Europeans
understand American ways and outlook better and
more sympathetically.
As for some of my impressions of circumstances
and life in the countries I have thus far visited, let
me begin by stressing the fact that now that I have
heen away from the highly-charged political tension
of Berlin for some weeks, it appears that Berlin is
really a very special case in European politics and
not at all typical of the general problems in Ger
many as a whole or even of Vienna.
Berlin is atypical! One finds there a "fighting"
hold and quite deadly earnest spirit on the part of
the West Berliners regarding the Russians which is
not at all evident in Vienna or Yugoslavia. Perhaps
the West Berliners have lived through far more
bitter experiences at the hands of the Soviets than
have these other two areas. At any rate, it is
significant to note the differences in Communist
tactics and successes in the three different places.
Although it is the very picture of prosperity and
efficiency, the much fought over free port of Trieste
is a turmoil of political intrigue and depends for its
long run survival upon cooperation and peaceful
trade relations among Yugoslavia and Italy after the
withdrawal of the British and American Military Gov
ernment Mission. I witnessed demonstrations of po
litical sentiment regarding Trieste's destiny both in
Trieste itself on the part of the pro-Italian factions
and also in Belgrade on the part of the Yugoslav
factions.
There will probably be no easily engineered settle
ment of the interests involved in this free port. My
opiition is that, despite whichever side eventually
wins ultimate possession of Trieste, its prosperity will
never be so great as during the recent past when
the port was employed as a trans-shipping point for
Allied War and defense supplies. The trade of nearby
"Iron Curtain Countries" must How through Trieste
once again to bring it a continued high living standard.

over Stanford experiences, and I was graciously shown
the sights of Munchen.
Joe Wiesinger, a member of the first group of ASSU
Foreign Scholars ever to come to Stanford, enter
tained me in Linz, Austria, and described to me his
interesting work in the office of the Federal Police
where he operates closely with the attached American
Army Criminal Investigation Department.
Now employed in the Political Affairs Division of
the Austrian Foreign Ministry in Vienna, Karl
Kisler (1950-51) was a most affable and charming
host. His Stanford year plus his internship this
past summer with the U.N. at Lake Success were
important reasons for his appointment to his pres
( nl post of responsibility. Through Karl I learned
(hat another of our former scholars from Austria,
Gottfried-Karl Kindermann (1949-50) is now once
again back in America as a protege of Professor
Hans Morgenthau at the University of Chicago.
In Athens I met Fotini Kaplanidou, ASSU Scholar
of 1949-50, who since her return to Greece has secured
on Instructionship at the famous "American School
for Gills" in Athens. Fontini lectures in the field
of Educational Methods and Psychology to pupils of
about 18-19 years of age. This is indeed a fine op
portunity and one in which it is possible to dissemi
nate actively in an experimental fashion to eager stu
dents information about America in a subject which
present-day Greece vitally needs that, is, modern,
western educational practices. Fotini is also a mem

ber of a drama society which is now touring northern
Greece to present to the public an insight into
American literature and theater works.
I hope also in about two weeks' time to see Hans
Rossi in Zurich, and I shall report to you later the
highlights of our get-together. It seems to me that
we may be proud of the useful and promising ac
tivities in which our former Foreign Scholars are
currently engaged. Such work is certainly contribu
ting in a direct manner toward helping Europeans
understand American ways and outlook better and
more sympathetically.
As for some of my impressions of circumstances
and life in the countries I have thus far visited, let
me begin by stressing the fact that now that I have
heen away from the highly-charged political tension
of Berlin for some weeks, it appears that Berlin is
really a very special case in European politics and
not at all typical of the general problems in Ger
many as a whole or even of Vienna.
Berlin is atypical! One finds there a "fighting"
hold and quite deadly earnest spirit on the part of
the West Berliners regarding the Russians which is
not at all evident in Vienna or Yugoslavia. Perhaps
the West Berliners have lived through far more
bitter experiences at the hands of the Soviets than
have these other two areas. At any rate, it is
significant to note the differences in Communist
tactics and successes in the three different places.
Although it is the very picture of prosperity and
efficiency, the much fought over free port of Trieste
is a turmoil of political intrigue and depends for its
long run survival upon cooperation and peaceful
trade relations among Yugoslavia and Italy after the
withdrawal of the British and American Military Gov
ernment Mission. I witnessed demonstrations of po
litical sentiment regarding Trieste's destiny both in
Trieste itself on the part of the pro-Italian factions
and also in Belgrade on the part of the Yugoslav
factions.
There will probably be no easily engineered settle
ment of the interests involved in this free port. My
opiition is that, despite whichever side eventually
wins ultimate possession of Trieste, its prosperity will
never be so great as during the recent past when
the port was employed as a trans-shipping point for
Allied War and defense supplies. The trade of nearby
"Iron Curtain Countries" must How through Trieste
once again to bring it a continued high living standard.

again back in America as a protege of Professor
Hans Morgenthau at the University of Chicago.
In Athens I met Fotini Kaplanidou, ASSU Scholar
of 1949-50, who since her return to Greece has secured
on Instructionship at the famous "American School
for Gills" in Athens. Fontini lectures in the field
of Educational Methods and Psychology to pupils of
about 18-19 years of age. This is indeed a fine op
portunity and one in which it is possible to dissemi
nate actively in an experimental fashion to eager stu
dents information about America in a subject which
present-day Greece vitally needs that, is, modern,
western educational practices. Fotini is also a mem

ber of a drama society which is now touring northern
Greece to present to the public an insight into
American literature and theater works.
I hope also in about two weeks' time to see Hans
Rossi in Zurich, and I shall report to you later the
highlights of our get-together. It seems to me that
we may be proud of the useful and promising ac
tivities in which our former Foreign Scholars are
currently engaged. Such work is certainly contribu
ting in a direct manner toward helping Europeans
understand American ways and outlook better and
more sympathetically.
As for some of my impressions of circumstances
and life in the countries I have thus far visited, let
me begin by stressing the fact that now that I have
heen away from the highly-charged political tension
of Berlin for some weeks, it appears that Berlin is
really a very special case in European politics and
not at all typical of the general problems in Ger
many as a whole or even of Vienna.
Berlin is atypical! One finds there a "fighting"
hold and quite deadly earnest spirit on the part of
the West Berliners regarding the Russians which is
not at all evident in Vienna or Yugoslavia. Perhaps
the West Berliners have lived through far more
bitter experiences at the hands of the Soviets than
have these other two areas. At any rate, it is
significant to note the differences in Communist
tactics and successes in the three different places.
Although it is the very picture of prosperity and
efficiency, the much fought over free port of Trieste
is a turmoil of political intrigue and depends for its
long run survival upon cooperation and peaceful
trade relations among Yugoslavia and Italy after the
withdrawal of the British and American Military Gov
ernment Mission. I witnessed demonstrations of po
litical sentiment regarding Trieste's destiny both in
Trieste itself on the part of the pro-Italian factions
and also in Belgrade on the part of the Yugoslav
factions.
There will probably be no easily engineered settle
ment of the interests involved in this free port. My
opiition is that, despite whichever side eventually
wins ultimate possession of Trieste, its prosperity will
never be so great as during the recent past when
the port was employed as a trans-shipping point for
Allied War and defense supplies. The trade of nearby
"Iron Curtain Countries" must How through Trieste
once again to bring it a continued high living standard.
(Editor's note: The following is the first part of
a letter dated Naples, April 9, from Phil Nielsen,
ASSU Exchange Scholar to the Free University of
Berlin. In it. Nielsen tells of meeting several for
mer ASSU Foreign Scholars in Southern Europe.)
As part of my present Spring vacation trip
through a few other European countries, I have
had the pleasure to visit a number of our former
ASSU Foreign Scholars in some of the major
cities on my itinerary.
In Munchen I stayed several days with Fritz Mar
gulies (1949-50 Foreign Scholar) and his young wife
and new son. Fritz has been active writing articles
on current public problems for a local newspaper,
but at the moment he is devoting his energies to the
creation of a new youth organization for young
Bavarians—a sorely needed development. We talked
over Stanford experiences, and I was graciously shown
the sights of Munchen.
Joe Wiesinger, a member of the first group of ASSU
Foreign Scholars ever to come to Stanford, enter
tained me in Linz, Austria, and described to me his
interesting work in the office of the Federal Police
where he operates closely with the attached American
Army Criminal Investigation Department.
Now employed in the Political Affairs Division of
the Austrian Foreign Ministry in Vienna, Karl
Kisler (1950-51) was a most affable and charming
host. His Stanford year plus his internship this
past summer with the U.N. at Lake Success were
important reasons for his appointment to his pres
( nl post of responsibility. Through Karl I learned
(hat another of our former scholars from Austria,
