## A 						Sporting Chance 
### 
BOUQUET OF THE WEEK—This week Bob White, the small man's
answer to Bob Mathias, rates the admiring tip of the hat. Better known
to his Delt fraternity brothers as "Quail," Bob stands only a wiry 5' 10",

145 pounds, which leaves him out
of heavyweight track and football
competition.
Nevertheless, Bob is capping his
senior year by lending a hand as his
talents are needed in three different
sports.
First off, for the second straight
year he sweated down to be Stan
ford's top boxer at 139, pounds and
one of the few Card ringmen to
be a consistent winner.
He then filled in on the Stanford
gymnastic team, where he has been
consistent performer fx>r the past
three years.
Moving over to swimming, he went
up to the Davis Relays last weekend
with no workouts and helped the
Card diving team (the others: Bill
Glathe and John Miller) to three
firsts: one-meter springboard, three-

meter springboard, and five-meter platform.
ANOTHER OLYMPIC COMPETITOK—CarIos Bea may add himself to
the crew of Stanford athletes in the Olympic Games. Not for the US,
however, but as a member of the Cuban basketball team.
STILL ON THE BOAT?—Sharon Geary, earlier this season tabbed
as one of the United States' top international competitors in the backstroke
and freestyle, was kept out of the Women's National AAU swim champion
ships by an injured shoulder.
The mishap, however, does not affect her Olympic chances—other than
keeping her from txaining for several weeks. The Women's Olympic trials
will not be held until early in July.
SOME WISHFUL THINKING—After the great lineup of spectator
pleasing events which featured the Card athletic schedule two weeks ago—
including the Bruin track meet, SC baseball doubleheader, Cal tennis match,
and assorted swimming, golf, and JV meets—it's sad there was virtually
nothing to watch this last weekend.
The schedule makers have a tough job to fit in the multitude of sports,
but a little more effort will be appreciated by Farm spectators, namely
this corner.
I'LL TAKE THAT BET—Hiller B. Zobel, who writes "Egg in Your
Beer" for the Harvard Crimson sports page, recently slammed Will Con
nolly for a column on Harvards sports de-emphasis.
After a snide remark on "Stanford's athletic slush fund: the Buck of
the Month Club,' (There are a helluva lot of great guys on this campus
whose educations have been made possible by the big and little Bucks)
our boy Hiller offered to bet Mr. C. a fin that Harvard will have a better
.season than the Cards this fall.
We're going to take that bet for Connolly, 'cause we don't see how
1 lie Cards can possibly be weaker than tlic Crimson this fall. Even if we
don't beat as many Podunk JC outfits, we ought to be able to take the
White Buck boys if we played them. Might be closer than the 44 to 0
of a couple of years back, though.
WHY COULDN'T IT HAPPEN HERE—IN THE POLE VAULT—WSC's
Jim Duncan casually walked onto the practice field one day, picked up a
javelin, and hurled it off into the distance. Coach Jack Mooberry was so
impressed he signed the lacl on the spot, and only three weeks later Duncan
tossed the spear 193' 5", real PCC competition.
