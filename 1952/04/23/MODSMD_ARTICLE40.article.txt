## Larry Cahn ... And in The Majors 
### 
As the Majors move into their
second week of play it is no sur
prise to find the Dodgers leading
the National circuit, and the
Cleveland Indians away and
winging in the American
League.
The Brooklyn bats are booming.
In their first three games the Bums
smashed 48 hits off Boston pitchers.
The Dodgers after copping five
straight suffered their first loss Sun
day to the Giants' Sal Maglie, who
twirled a two hitter to break the
New Yorkers' three game losing
streak.
With Carl Furillo, Roy Campa
nula, Jackie Robinson, and Billy Cox
batting around the 400 mark and
with Andy Pafko already having
banged five round trippers the Dod
gers look like a team that will be
hard to beat. Their batting may
make up for not too good pitching
and the Army loss of hurler Don
Newcomb.
The reverse holds true in the
American League. The Indians can
attribute their jet like seven-win,
first-place start to their staff of ex
cellent hurlers. Cleveland at this
time last year was already in second
spot and didn't make their move un
til late summer. And then it was too
late.
With both Bobs, Lemon and Feller,
Mike Garcia, Steve Cromek, Art
Houtteman, Early Wynn, and Lou
Brissie, coupled with adequate hit
ting, the Indians may never be
headed.
The St. Louis Browns after mak
ing shambles of opponents in ex
hibition play continued on their
merry way to wind up with five wins
and two losses. New owner Bill
Veeek and Manager Rogers Hornsby
have come up with a good club which
appears destined for first division
honors, which is a bit better than
last year when the Brownies finished
last and 46 games off the pace.
The perennial champion New York
Yankees might not have what it
takes. The champs are already a
good three games behind the Indians.
At no time last year were the Yanks
farther back than 3V2.
It might be a good thing for the
National Game if the Yanks don't
take it again this year. For the New
Yorkers have a crop of rookies and
sophs that need about one year of
seasoning and then it looks like a
long Yankee reign.
This week the American League
sked finds Cleveland in St. Louis
for two games which should prove
just how good the Brownies are,
while the Yanks will be taking on
their cousins, the Red Sox.
And in the Senior loop, the Dodg
ers meet Boston, the Phillies, and
the Giants in a hectic seven game
week.

The Dodgers after copping five
straight suffered their first loss Sun
day to the Giants' Sal Maglie, who
twirled a two hitter to break the
New Yorkers' three game losing
streak.
With Carl Furillo, Roy Campa
nula, Jackie Robinson, and Billy Cox
batting around the 400 mark and
with Andy Pafko already having
banged five round trippers the Dod
gers look like a team that will be
hard to beat. Their batting may
make up for not too good pitching
and the Army loss of hurler Don
Newcomb.
The reverse holds true in the
American League. The Indians can
attribute their jet like seven-win,
first-place start to their staff of ex
cellent hurlers. Cleveland at this
time last year was already in second
spot and didn't make their move un
til late summer. And then it was too
late.
With both Bobs, Lemon and Feller,
Mike Garcia, Steve Cromek, Art
Houtteman, Early Wynn, and Lou
Brissie, coupled with adequate hit
ting, the Indians may never be
headed.
The St. Louis Browns after mak
ing shambles of opponents in ex
hibition play continued on their
merry way to wind up with five wins
and two losses. New owner Bill
Veeek and Manager Rogers Hornsby
have come up with a good club which
appears destined for first division
honors, which is a bit better than
last year when the Brownies finished
last and 46 games off the pace.
The perennial champion New York
Yankees might not have what it
takes. The champs are already a
good three games behind the Indians.
At no time last year were the Yanks
farther back than 3V2.
It might be a good thing for the
National Game if the Yanks don't
take it again this year. For the New
Yorkers have a crop of rookies and
sophs that need about one year of
seasoning and then it looks like a
long Yankee reign.
This week the American League
sked finds Cleveland in St. Louis
for two games which should prove
just how good the Brownies are,
while the Yanks will be taking on
their cousins, the Red Sox.
And in the Senior loop, the Dodg
ers meet Boston, the Phillies, and
the Giants in a hectic seven game
week.
As the Majors move into their
second week of play it is no sur
prise to find the Dodgers leading
the National circuit, and the
Cleveland Indians away and
winging in the American
League.
The Brooklyn bats are booming.
In their first three games the Bums
smashed 48 hits off Boston pitchers.
