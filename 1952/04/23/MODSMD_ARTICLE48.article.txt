# Demo Machine Stalled by Candidate Hunt
## W. Averell Harriman Seems Like Old-Guard Choice for Nomination 
### HADLEY ROFF 
If there was such a thing as a political cardiograph it most likely
has crumbled from frustration after testing the erratic pulsebeat
of American politics—l9s2 style.
Erratic is the word describing politics this year. As soon as a
trend becomes apparent, it is shattered like china dishes smack
ing a wall. ♦

Look at the Democratic party
where confusion swirls supreme.
By now old guard Democrats
thought they would have the political
machine chugging fast. But today
the machine has been sidetracked as
the bosses hunt for a suitable can
didate.
It begins to seem likely that W.
Averell Harriman, Mutual Secur
ity Administrator, will get the nod
at the Democratic convention.
Harry Truman was expected to be
the standard bearer by most old
guard Democrats. Though the presi
dent insisted that his mind was not
made iin, the leaders felt sure that
he would lead the party charge. And
they felt secure in that belief when,
by late March, the President hadn't
pulled himself from the race.
But their guessing proved faulty.
Suddenly, without even a whis
pered hint, Truman on March 29
announced to 5,000 shocked Demo
crats at a great Washington dinner
that he would not seek rc-clcction.
Who then, screamed the old
guards, can carry the party banner?
Estcs Kefauver? Certainly not. He's
surrounded himself with a new
crowd of Democrats. Patronage
would be scrambled worse than eggs
at "Greasy Joe's" Cafe.
Perhaps Adlai Stevenson of Illi
nois, the Trumanites suggested.
Illinois is a pivotal state, and Stev
enson has a fine record as gover
nor. So the trumpets began to
bU.vc for Stevenson and lit seemed
sure for the nomination.
But the parade for Stevenson was
short lived. Last Thursday lie set
Democratic hearts to fluttering
madly when he bowed from the racc.
The Illinois governor's announce
ment stated:
"I have repeatedly said that I
was a candidate for governor of
Illinois and have no other ambi
tions."
"I must now add, that in view of
iny prior commitment to run for
governor and the desire of many
who have given me their help and

confidence in our unfinished work
in Illinois, I could not accept the
nomination for any other ollicc this
summer."
Thus it seems that W. Avcrcll
Harriman. now being pushed by the
delegation selected in the New York
primary, will become the favorite
of Administration Democrats.
Harriman has never served in an
elected capacity but has held re
sponsible government jobs includ
ing ambassador to Russia from 1943
to 194(1. lie also served as chief
administrator of Marshall Plan
funds in Europe in 194 X.
Aside from government posts, Har
riman has held high-rank industrial
positions including Chairman of the
Board of Union Pacific Railway from
1932 to 1946.
The only other old-guard men
tioned as a possible candidate is Vice
Pres. Alben Barkley who has still
not announced his intentions. He is
considered by many leaders to be
too old for the grueling job. He is 74.
Other Democrats running are
Robert Kerr of Oklahoma and Rich
ard Ilusscli of Georgia, both Sena
tors.
At the moment, Kefauver is the
only announced candidate who has
stacked in his favor a number of
pledged convention delegates. To
date he has about (iO in the bag.
The GO delegates chosen in the Illi
nois primary April 8 are not pledged
might possibly swing to Kefauver
considering the withdrawal of Stev
enson and Kcfauver's walloping vote
in that state.
Kefauver received staunch Illinois
backing from one quarter last week.

Last Thursday, Sen. Paul Douglas of j
that state said that he would back |
the Tennessee crime-buster for the
nomination. Douglas, regarded by
many to be the most outstanding
liberal in the today, might
be able to persuade the Illinois dele
gation to go Kefauver.
But only 524 of the delegates are
chosen by primary. 604 are picked
at state conventions and central
committee meetings. That is a ser
ious edge in a party where Truman's
statement, describing primaries as j
"eyewash" is considered a political
axiom.
