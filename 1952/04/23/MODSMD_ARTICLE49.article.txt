# Pembroke Dean Talks on Britain, Egyptian Problem
## 
### 
Professor Herbert S. Deighton,
Dean of Pembroke College, Oxford
University, spoke on Egypt and
Great Britain to a Hoover Library
group Monday afternoon.
, Treating the Egyptian problem as
a part of the general problem of
Western foreign relations, Deighton
discussed the great dilemma facing
the West. Military, especially naval,
demands call for marginal control
and maintenance of order in such
countries as Egypt; whereas ideo
logically the Western powers are
against interference and arc often
Unsympathetic to the established
order.
