WASHINGTON â€” Rep. Robert
Hale (R., Me.) urged the House to
day to impeach President Truman
for seizing the steel mills if there
is evidence the chief executive is
guilty of a "high crime or misde
meanor."
Simultaneously, Senate Republi
cans suffered at least a temporary
setback in their drive to force re
turn of the seized mills to their
owners through Congressional con
trol of the government purse
strings.
In still another development, the
President's Mobilization Advisory
Board decided that the Wage Sta
bilization Board stayed within its
rules in recommending a 26-ccnt
an-hour package pay raise for the
650,000 CIO United Steelworkers.
