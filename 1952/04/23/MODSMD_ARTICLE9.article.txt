## 'Food Problem To Get Worse' Cain Predicts 
### HARRY GLAZE 
The world is having a serious
food problem and will eventual
ly have a worse one. The United
States, in spite of its hopes for
isolationism, is being swept into
the maelstrom of solving it.
This is how Dr. Stanley A. Cain,
professor of conservation at the Uni
versity of Michigan, described our
position to last, night's Tuesday Eve
ning Series audience in Memorial
Auditorium.
He explained how the basic prob
lem is one discussed 50 years ago by
Malthus, who stated that man's re
productive capacity increases faster
than his productive capacity; thus
acute food shortages will develop.
Regarding our aid to foreign coun
tries, Dr. Cain said, "We keep pour
ing money in, hoping that the bucket
will overflow to bring prosperity. I
flon't think we have enough money
to pour into countries such as India."
Dr. Cain is a practical man, who
believes the United States should
exercise some caution in its expenses
—planning and learning about cul
tures before feeding them.
The Michigan conservationist also
stressed the idea of human quality
rather than quantity, and morality
rather than immorality. He believes
in birth control and moral restrictions
on population so that we can have a
more productive man.
Summing up he mentioned the
popular statement that we arc on the
right road but wondered—are we
going in the right direction?
