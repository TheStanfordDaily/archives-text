## Floods Split Dike At Sherman Field 
### 
KANSAS CITY, Mu„ April 2'.',
(UP) The angry Missouri River
swept over Sherman Air 112 orce Base
at historic Fort Leavenworth,
Kan., tonight, ending suddenly a
nine-day fight to save the installa
tion.
More than 85 soldiers were on
patrol duty and sandbagging detail
when the dike suddenly split open
and the yellow water poured onto
the runways.
Several trucks were parked near
by for such an emergency and the
soldiers climbed in quickly and
were driven from the field. Officers
said there was no panic, although
the break came as a "complete sur
prise."
Downstream Greater Kansas City,
still scarred from the great July
flood, awaited the mammoth crest.
Weary but river-wise troops kept,
constant vigil.
Brig. Gen. Don G. Shingler, Oma
ha, Missouri River District Engi
neer, said he was certain the situ
ation could be handled, but he
added that a great, river in flood
"always is something to be feared
and treated with respect,"
