# Zany Marx Frolic To Be Sunday Flick
## 
### 
The Marx Brothers bring their
own peculiar brand of insanity to
the Sunday Night Movie this week.
The movie is "Love Happy," their
latest release. Vera-Ellen is co
starred. The film particularly fea
tures the antics of Harpo Marx, wlio
has a field day escaping cops and
robbers.
A short, "Horsehide Heroes," and
the perennial Warner Brothers car
toon will precede the show.
