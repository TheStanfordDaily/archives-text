# Nielsen Finds Hospitality, High Prices in Yugoslavia
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: The following is the last part of
a letter dated Naples, April !), from Phil Nielsen,
ASSU Exchange Scholar to the Free University of
Berlin.)
In Yugoslavia the people everywhere were ex
tremely friendly and helpful. Their simple kindness
and hospitality were truly amazing. Their interest
in America seemed unquenchable, although many ex
pressed fear of being seen conversing with a for
eigner. Nowhere did I meet convinced, die-hard ex
ponents or propagandists of the Communist way of
life in Yugoslavia.
The people discussed politics openly and admitted
to failures and shortcomings of their system frankly.
Whenever I had occasion to deal with public officials,
it was my experience to find slowness and inefficiency
and above all it was impossible to place responsibility
definitely. No public agency wished to take respon
sibility, but always attempted to ''pass the buck" to
some other organization.
Goods Scarce in All Shops
Another strong impression from my stay in Yugo
slavia which remains in my mind is the dearth of
goods of all types in shops all over the country and
the high prices of those items which are to be found.
In this respect the difference between Greece and
Yugoslavia was enormous. In the former country the
shops are simply bulging with goods of every nature.
The primitive technical level of development to be
seen in Yugoslavia is also astounding and probably
a bit difficult for Americans to comprehend. Su':h
technical backwardness will take generations to re
move.
In observing a country such as Yugoslavia, one must
close out of the mind most of the basic material as
sumptions upon which a modern, highly developed
society operates and depends. Lastly, an overwhelm
ingly important insight at which one arrives after
visiting a nation such as either Yugoslavia or Greece
is the vast rule in the national life and economy
played by agriculture and those who exist from it as
a means of livelihood.

Farmers and Machines
When such nations speak of raising these standards
of living they must reckon with the cold fact that the
huge majority of their populations are mere simple
farmers who own but small plots of exhausted land
and who have little wherewithal to invest in ma
chinery whose workings they would have to be
brought to understand over the course of time.
An inescapable impression conveyed to any casual
observer all over Europe today is the fantastically
large number of men in uniform and under arms.
In Germany and Austria, in Yugoslavia and Greece
and in Italy are troops and weapons to be seen. In
Germany and Austria the soldiers are members of the
occupation forces, but this is not so in the other
lands and for nations of small industrial capacity, still
suffering from the losses of war, the maintenance of
huge military forces represents a heavy drain and
weight on the standard of living of the average citizen.
Another War Foreseen
Most of the people to whom I talked in the above
mentioned countries believe in the coming of another
war, but they hope, of course, it will never arrive.
In conclusion I have been impressed by the dif
ferences to the moral standards and the temperaments
of the various national peoples I have thus far seen.
This variety and its very depth makes complicated the
common solution of any joint problems or undertak
ings, especially where people have in the main such
a need for education.
My best wishes and heartiest greetings to you all.
Let me certainly urge you to avail yourselves of the
opportunity of becoming acquainted with your ASSU
Foreign Scholars and with every possible guest from
abroad who is studying at Stanford. We have much
from these people to learn and I believe it's better
to learn it at the first opportunity from friendly
young students.

Whenever I had occasion to deal with public officials,
it was my experience to find slowness and inefficiency
and above all it was impossible to place responsibility
definitely. No public agency wished to take respon
sibility, but always attempted to ''pass the buck" to
some other organization.
Goods Scarce in All Shops
Another strong impression from my stay in Yugo
slavia which remains in my mind is the dearth of
goods of all types in shops all over the country and
the high prices of those items which are to be found.
In this respect the difference between Greece and
Yugoslavia was enormous. In the former country the
shops are simply bulging with goods of every nature.
The primitive technical level of development to be
seen in Yugoslavia is also astounding and probably
a bit difficult for Americans to comprehend. Su':h
technical backwardness will take generations to re
move.
In observing a country such as Yugoslavia, one must
close out of the mind most of the basic material as
sumptions upon which a modern, highly developed
society operates and depends. Lastly, an overwhelm
ingly important insight at which one arrives after
visiting a nation such as either Yugoslavia or Greece
is the vast rule in the national life and economy
played by agriculture and those who exist from it as
a means of livelihood.

Farmers and Machines
When such nations speak of raising these standards
of living they must reckon with the cold fact that the
huge majority of their populations are mere simple
farmers who own but small plots of exhausted land
and who have little wherewithal to invest in ma
chinery whose workings they would have to be
brought to understand over the course of time.
An inescapable impression conveyed to any casual
observer all over Europe today is the fantastically
large number of men in uniform and under arms.
In Germany and Austria, in Yugoslavia and Greece
and in Italy are troops and weapons to be seen. In
Germany and Austria the soldiers are members of the
occupation forces, but this is not so in the other
lands and for nations of small industrial capacity, still
suffering from the losses of war, the maintenance of
huge military forces represents a heavy drain and
weight on the standard of living of the average citizen.
Another War Foreseen
Most of the people to whom I talked in the above
mentioned countries believe in the coming of another
war, but they hope, of course, it will never arrive.
In conclusion I have been impressed by the dif
ferences to the moral standards and the temperaments
of the various national peoples I have thus far seen.
This variety and its very depth makes complicated the
common solution of any joint problems or undertak
ings, especially where people have in the main such
a need for education.
My best wishes and heartiest greetings to you all.
Let me certainly urge you to avail yourselves of the
opportunity of becoming acquainted with your ASSU
Foreign Scholars and with every possible guest from
abroad who is studying at Stanford. We have much
from these people to learn and I believe it's better
to learn it at the first opportunity from friendly
young students.

In Yugoslavia the people everywhere were ex
tremely friendly and helpful. Their simple kindness
and hospitality were truly amazing. Their interest
in America seemed unquenchable, although many ex
pressed fear of being seen conversing with a for
eigner. Nowhere did I meet convinced, die-hard ex
ponents or propagandists of the Communist way of
life in Yugoslavia.
The people discussed politics openly and admitted
to failures and shortcomings of their system frankly.
