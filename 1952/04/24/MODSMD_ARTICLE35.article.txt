# Campus, Coeds Pretty Say 300 Visiting Sailors
## 
### 
It was sailors' day on Quad yes
terday when about 300 middies
l'rom the Alameda Naval and Coast
Guard Base visited Stanford to at
tend the Seahawk-Stanford varsity
baseball battle.
Ambling about campus before the
game, many of the Coast Guards
men remarked that "Stanford is
much prettier than Cal."
Camera shutters weren't working
as fast as some eyelids as Guards
men said that Stanford girls are
more beautiful and friendly than
their counterparts on the Berkeley
campus.
Two of them, who came from

the I!ast, commented that Califor
nians take a great deal of pride i
in their home stale. They felt, j
however, that youths of high
school age "lived faster" and were |
always looking for new forms of !
excitement out here. "Tlu-y need j
more guidance," they said.
What about the baseball game?
Unanimously, they prophesied that I
their team would win hands down, j
"Most of our boys were profession
als," they stated. '"So far, they're i
undefeated." (Events proved that I
the Coast Guard prophets were cor
rect, as their team downed the Card
nine 7-3.)
