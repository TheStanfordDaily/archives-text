# Crew Preps for Trojans
## 
### DEWEY HECHT 
Stanford's varsity oarsmen take
on USC this weekend in the sixth
annual Roxy Cup sprint race. The
crews will race over a 2,000-meter
course, finishing at the entrance to
the 1-alo Alto Yacht Harbor.
This is the first intercollegiate
regatta to be held this year by
Stanford. Last week's interclass
match, spoiled by high winds and

rough water, was ruled a tie be
tween the seniors and sophomores.
The Trojans shuold not provide
too much competition for the In
dian crew. SC was beaten by a
length last week when they raced
UCLA over a 2,000-meter course.
They will be a measuring stick to
see how the Cards stack up against
the Bruins.
