Frosh (let Short-changed

The NCAA, in an effort to clean up the freshman eligibility mess, has
came out with a real stinking rule. This year, with the war scare and
predicted scarcity of material, freshmen were given the go ahead to play
and mmnctp on Varsity teams in the Pacific Coast Conference.

Most of the other conferences throughout the
country followed suit. So this reason first-year
athletes who could make the grade were competing
on their collegiate varsities. The one notable excep
tion to this widespread practice was the Ivy League.
In the past before the war emergency situation,
the NCAA had two general rules regarding frosh
athletes. 1) They were not allowed to compete in any
NCAA event. 2) No man was allowed to enter NCAA
events more than three years.
All the loops under NCAA sanction, and that
includes all the major ones from Coast to Coast, fol
lowed the rules and did not permit freshmen to play
with the big boys. That was before this year.

Falling in ime with the move to combat the manpower shortage, the
top brass of the NCAA council yielded and allowed frosh to compete
in their sponsored events. They played on lnotball squads and were on
the gridiron for teams playing in the postseason Bowl Games, which had
the national body's sanction.
Then later on, frosh wiio happened to be wearing the uniform of schools
that had top-flight basketball crews were still on the hardwoods when
the NCAA play-offs began. Don Bragg was with the UCLA Bruins and
the Santa Clara Broncos were loaded with frosh talent.
Same policy holds with the collegiate swimming classic held on the
Princeton campus over Spring vacation. Our own Larry Heim scored some
points to help push the Indians to fifth place.
On April 17 the NCAA guiding fathers pulled a triple reverse on their
frosh policy. The April Edict says no frosh may compete in a NCAA
sponsored event. That means all the finals lor the national title. However,
the freshmen are still permitted to play within their respective loops.
Do we mean that frosh distance ace Bob Reed can't compete in the
National track meet? Yes, that's the rule interpretation by tha top group.
And what happens to the red-hot Indian golf squad? No, Fred Brown and
Warren Dailey can not tour the links when the big plum is at stake. That
eliminates Stanford's number one and three men from the Nationals.
The April Edict includes baseball (there go Rich Scramaglia and Ken
Brown off the Card nine in the event of a CIBA crown) and all other
Spring sports.
If there's any consistency in that switchover in the middle of the aca
demic year, it's beyond the Sporting Line to figure out. Why should frosh
in Spring sports be discriminated against? Are they any different than
footballers and basketballers?
It seems that as long as they were allowed to play in the loop and
have earned Varsity letters they also should have the right to enter and
vie for National honors. It's only a suggestion.
As far as the NCAA's attitude toward the frosh in the future, two gen
eral principles seem to be involving both from the national body and from
the various leagues. First, no more frosh eligibility. Secondly, those ath
letes who have played Varsity sports this year will be permitted to have
three more years or a total of four.

A little review of the Wooley incident down at USC. John was pushed
going around the first turn of the half-mile. He lost several yards because
of the jostling. Then around the second turn, he was pushed to the ground
by a Trojan who was bidding for the lead.
The fall prevented Wooley from making his stretch run for the wire
and a possible first place. A foul was not claimed because the SC man was
fourth and it would have no effect on the point total. All John wanted
was a much-deserved apology. He didn't get one.

Spring sports.
If there's any consistency in that switchover in the middle of the aca
demic year, it's beyond the Sporting Line to figure out. Why should frosh
in Spring sports be discriminated against? Are they any different than
footballers and basketballers?
It seems that as long as they were allowed to play in the loop and
have earned Varsity letters they also should have the right to enter and
vie for National honors. It's only a suggestion.
As far as the NCAA's attitude toward the frosh in the future, two gen
eral principles seem to be involving both from the national body and from
the various leagues. First, no more frosh eligibility. Secondly, those ath
letes who have played Varsity sports this year will be permitted to have
three more years or a total of four.

A little review of the Wooley incident down at USC. John was pushed
going around the first turn of the half-mile. He lost several yards because
of the jostling. Then around the second turn, he was pushed to the ground
by a Trojan who was bidding for the lead.
The fall prevented Wooley from making his stretch run for the wire
and a possible first place. A foul was not claimed because the SC man was
fourth and it would have no effect on the point total. All John wanted
was a much-deserved apology. He didn't get one.

Frosh (let Short-changed

The NCAA, in an effort to clean up the freshman eligibility mess, has
came out with a real stinking rule. This year, with the war scare and
predicted scarcity of material, freshmen were given the go ahead to play
and mmnctp on Varsity teams in the Pacific Coast Conference.

Most of the other conferences throughout the
country followed suit. So this reason first-year
athletes who could make the grade were competing
on their collegiate varsities. The one notable excep
tion to this widespread practice was the Ivy League.
In the past before the war emergency situation,
the NCAA had two general rules regarding frosh
athletes. 1) They were not allowed to compete in any
NCAA event. 2) No man was allowed to enter NCAA
events more than three years.
All the loops under NCAA sanction, and that
includes all the major ones from Coast to Coast, fol
lowed the rules and did not permit freshmen to play
with the big boys. That was before this year.

Falling in ime with the move to combat the manpower shortage, the
top brass of the NCAA council yielded and allowed frosh to compete
in their sponsored events. They played on lnotball squads and were on
the gridiron for teams playing in the postseason Bowl Games, which had
the national body's sanction.
Then later on, frosh wiio happened to be wearing the uniform of schools
that had top-flight basketball crews were still on the hardwoods when
the NCAA play-offs began. Don Bragg was with the UCLA Bruins and
the Santa Clara Broncos were loaded with frosh talent.
Same policy holds with the collegiate swimming classic held on the
Princeton campus over Spring vacation. Our own Larry Heim scored some
points to help push the Indians to fifth place.
On April 17 the NCAA guiding fathers pulled a triple reverse on their
frosh policy. The April Edict says no frosh may compete in a NCAA
sponsored event. That means all the finals lor the national title. However,
the freshmen are still permitted to play within their respective loops.
Do we mean that frosh distance ace Bob Reed can't compete in the
National track meet? Yes, that's the rule interpretation by tha top group.
And what happens to the red-hot Indian golf squad? No, Fred Brown and
Warren Dailey can not tour the links when the big plum is at stake. That
eliminates Stanford's number one and three men from the Nationals.
The April Edict includes baseball (there go Rich Scramaglia and Ken
Brown off the Card nine in the event of a CIBA crown) and all other
Spring sports.
