# Bonnets and Buggies Head 'Back to Farm'
## â€˜Gay Nineties' Week Originates To Strengthen Stanford Family 
### RUBY BERNSTEIN 
All the glamour of the gay
nineties will be revived today
and tomorrow as the sixth an
nual "Back to the Farm" cele
bration gets under way on cam
pus.
The "Back to the Farm" move is
not new to Stanford. It originated
in 1940 when student leaders, wor
ried over the loss of Stanford spirit,
decided that they might inspire
unity in the Stanford family if they
could return to the days when
Stanford was a "farm."
The original celebration started
with Traditions Day. Skits depict
ing Stanford traditions, such as the
Honor Code and no flowers for girls
at dances, were presented by mem
bers of the freshman class.
At this first celebration Clark
Shaughncssy, the football coach
destined to lead the Indians to
the Rose Bowl, made his debut at
a rallv attended by 2,ft00 students.
In '40 they really went all out to
make Stanford the scene of the
bygone days. Palm Drive was
blockaded, and boneless carriages
were vetoed on campus. Today,

however, this would be an incon
venience to the large number of
students who live off campus and
at the Village.
Old-fashioned clothes were the
vogue. Adding to the Western
flavor were "No-Gun Ned" and
his vigilantes, who tossed viola

tors of Ilello Day into the House
go w built in front of the library.
In 15)42 the activities were lim
ited to one day. This was the
last "Bark to the Farm" move
until aftcv the war.
In 1949 the activities were re
vived by Cardinals with a four-day
schedule. The week opened with
Hello Day. This included the tra
dition of being friendly on campus
and a series of exchanges so Stan
ford brothers and sisters would gel
to know each other.
Traditions Day was the second
day. The third day was designated
as "Back to the Farm." This was
the big day when bare feet, jeans,
old cars, and old clolhcs pre
vailed. The last event was Sadie
Hawkins Day, which was dis
placed the next year by Olympics
Day.
In 1950 another jail was installed
and violators of Hello Day were
given a mock trial. The same year
another Rose Bowl coach was
hailed. Chuck Taylor was given a
farewell at the "Back to the Farm'
musical production sponsored by
the freshmen. Taylor was leavine
to become the coach of the San
Francisco '49ers. Appropriately, his
