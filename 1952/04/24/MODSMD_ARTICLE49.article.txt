# Old Clothes Stylish Today
## 
### 
The year's only regressive fash
ion show will be held today. Any
attire of by-gone days, from the
Gay Nineties to Grandma's old
bonnet, will be high style on
Quad, according to Cardinals
Mary Strickland and Roy Alex
ander.
Old, tattered costumes, flapper
dresses, middies, or corn-fed Li'l
Abner fashions with big boys, di
lapidated straw hats, and chewed
up pipes will hold sway.
This afternoon the "Grapes of
Wrath" atmosphere will pervade
the annual Old Car Parade.
