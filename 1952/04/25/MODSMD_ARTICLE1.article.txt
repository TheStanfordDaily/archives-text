## Steel Wins Legal Bout 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 24 (UP)—
The steel industry asked the federal
court today to ban a government
dictated wage increase for the steel
workers and then scored its first
tactical victory in the legal battle to
regain its seized plants.
Industry attorneys appealed for a
temporary injunction against Presi
dent Truman's seizure order, but
said thoy would be satisfied tempo
rarily if Secretary of Commerce
Charles Sawyer was barred from
granting a multi - million - dollar
wage increase to the 650,000 CIO
United Steel workers.
The industry, blocked in two pre
vious attempts to have the seizure
order killed, won its initial court
victory when Federal Judge David
A. Pine refuted a government re
quest for a week's delay in the
court proceedings.

Meanwhile, President Truman
said today that he has never even
thought about seizing the nation's
press or radio but he did not re
nounce the idea that he has an "in
herent" right to do so in an emer
gency.
Turning to the issue that brought
up the question last week—the steel
seizure—Mr. Truman said he had
to act. He said the nation faced as
great an emergency as it ever has
and he did not intend to suffer set
backs in the Korean war for lack
of steel.
He denounced Republican moves
to impeach him for the seizure as
politically inspired, and said that
lie has a pretty good defense if the
House wants to try it. He did not
go into details.
