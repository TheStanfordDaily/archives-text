# Saving Time Starts Sunday
## 
### 
Those individuals who need the
[ perennial eight hours sleep each
I night will have to remember to re
| tire an hour earlier Sunday night.
Tlie reasonâ€”California is going back
on Daylight Savings Time.
The act of switching to DST is
| relatively simple. One has just to

remember to push the hands of his
clock up an hour after midnight
Sunday.
But while students will lose an
hours sleep, bartenders will have an
extra 60 minutes to care for their
corns as they shut down shop 3600
seconds earlier.
Daylight savings time, which is
credited to Ben Franklin, is intended
to provide an extra hour of sunshine.
The system will prevail until Sept. 28.
