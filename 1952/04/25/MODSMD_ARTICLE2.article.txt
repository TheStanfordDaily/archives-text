WASHINGTON — President Tru
man accused Congress today of tak
ing a "penny-wise-pound-foolish"
attitude toward civil defense and of
starving the program to a point
which jeopardizes national security.
He made the charge in sending to
Congress a civil defense report
showing that not one single Ameri
can city has made adequate prepa
rations for an enemy attack. He
said many factors are involved but
that Congress shares a large part
of the blame.
Mr. Truman said the civil defense
program "has been starved for lack
of adequate appropriations" ever
sincc it was set up in January, 1951.
He appealed to the lawmakers to
provide the full $600,000,000 he has
asked for the program next year.
The report shows some progress,
Mr. Truman said, but not enough
that "we can begin to feel rea
sonably secure about the defense of
the United States."
