# Indian Cindermen Seek Revenge over Oxy Stars
## Relay May Decide 
### DICK KLEIN Daily Sports Editor 
Still licking their wounds from
last year's upset by these very
same Tigers and smarting from
last weekend's Trojan massacre,
the Card track sguad will host
the Occidental thinclads this
Saturday. The meet gets under
way at 1:30 p.m. in the big Sta
dium oval.
Last year the Oxy runners and
junipers surprised Coach Jack
Weiershauser with a stunning fiB to
63 defeat. That was a close one all
the way to the wire, and this meet
shapes up to be even more a thriller.
It will be close (see the Dopesheet
on Sports Page) and there will be
some of the best races ever run on
the Farm.
Oxy "Potent"
The Oxy Tigers have a small, but
very potent group of competitors.
Naturally the outstanding men are
Bob McMillcn and John Barnes.
Both rate "best in the nation" ac
colades. Barnes has done 1:50.1 and
is the defending champion in the
National 880-yard run. Best so far

this season is a pokey 1:53. But he's
rounding into form and, with John
Wooley and Wally McCamant chas
ing him, should be ready for his
assault on the world's record book.
McMillen is the outstanding dis
tanceman. He has already beaten
USC's Art Garcia in the mile and
is capable of running the two mile
in under 9:20. Not many can do the
lung-bursting eight laps much faster,
but Stanfordites feel that two of the
very few are Bob Simon and Bob
Reed.

Best reports from the BAC arc
those about Bob Mathias. His thigh
seems to be all healed up, and the
doctors have reportedly given Bob
the signal for an all-out effort. After
being kept out of the winner's circle
by SC, the Decathlon Dynamo should
really be set to produce.
He's a sure winner in the discus
and should have an easy time of it.
in the high hurdles. He'll pass up
the lows for safety's sake. That':;
two firsts right off, and lie could
hustle up a few more with a second
in the pole vault and a third in the
shot.
Field Events
Stanford, once again, will count
heavily on field events for big point
totals. Sweeps in the discus and shot
arc more than likely. A sweep in
the javelin is not out of sight. First
is secure with Leo Long whipping the
spear out around the 200 mark. Kim
ball and Harlow must approach their
i bests to beat out the best Oxy man.
The two jumping events could be
very vital in the final reckoning.
All men are quite closely bunched.
; A preponderance of come-throughs
i on the part of any one team could
| spell victory. The Indians will rely
hpavily on Pete McKay in the broad
jump and Nas Fishback, Ron Allen,
and Wes Frye in the high jump.
The sprints will be not too fast,
especially the 100. Oxy's top ace,
1 Sherman Miller, is still on the mend.
Coach Jack feels that Maury Par
sons should be able to sneak home
with the prize in the century and
also tally something in the furlong.
If things go according to past per
formances, the final mile relay could
be the decider. The meet's that close.
And with both teams having about
the same record for time, it should
be a hum-dinger of a race. The edge
! has to go to the Tigers with Mr.
1 Barnes handling the last - ditch
anchor lap.

It will be close (see the Dopesheet

some of the best races ever run on
the Farm.
Oxy "Potent"
The Oxy Tigers have a small, but
very potent group of competitors.
Naturally the outstanding men are
Bob McMillcn and John Barnes.
Both rate "best in the nation" ac
colades. Barnes has done 1:50.1 and
is the defending champion in the
National 880-yard run. Best so far

this season is a pokey 1:53. But he's
rounding into form and, with John
Wooley and Wally McCamant chas
ing him, should be ready for his
assault on the world's record book.
McMillen is the outstanding dis
tanceman. He has already beaten
USC's Art Garcia in the mile and
is capable of running the two mile
in under 9:20. Not many can do the
lung-bursting eight laps much faster,
but Stanfordites feel that two of the
very few are Bob Simon and Bob
Reed.
