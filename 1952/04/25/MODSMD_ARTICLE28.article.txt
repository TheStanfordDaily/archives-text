# An Answer to Graduate Needs
## 
### 
Stanford graduate students have never been
an integral part of the student body. They are
represented on Excom, true, but for various
reasons, have stood apart from the stream of
undergraduate life.
The reasons are several. First, a greater per
centage of them are married. Most live off
campus. Graduates are usually more interested
in scholarship than in undergraduate social life.
At the same time their needs — social and
otherwise, are not much different from those
of the undergraduate. Yet graduates have never
been organized in such a way so as to express
their needs and desires effectively.
The approval by Excom Wednesday night of
a temporary Graduate Students' Association,
which is expected to evolve next fall into a per
manent organization, can be an instrument
whereby these needs and desires can be ex
pressed.

Graduate students usually como to Stanford
poorly oriented. A permanent association of
2,750 graduates organized on undergraduate
class basis could give them representation on
the pre-reg committee to provide orientation on
such important matters as the honor code,
which has been lacking in the past.
At present, graduates have no machinery for
arranging social programs. A recent question
naire indicates there is a great desire among
grads for inter-graduate mixers, teas, dances,
and the like. Nor have graduates ever had a
voice in planning all-campus social activities.
A graduate representative on Cardinals through
the association would allow grads to express
their desires on all-campus social activities.
Lastly, by making the graduates a more in
tegral component of "The Stanford family,"
such complaints as low graduate voting would
be answered.
