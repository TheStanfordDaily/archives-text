# Froman Story True Hollywood
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
"With a Song in My Heart," now at the Stanford,
is the story of Jane Froman, the singing sensation of
the '30's who came close to losing her life and closer
to losing a leg in a wartime plane crash near Lisbon.
Saved from death by the co-pilot whom she was

later to marry (and who was in
volved only two weeks ago in the
Puerto Rican air disaster), she was
saved from life in a wheelchair by
her own spirit and faith.
Even without a highpoint of
such dramatic proportions, singer
Froman's life would seem tailor
made for Hollywood treatment.

Her rapid rise to nightclub and Broadway success
via radio, her USO tours, her eclipse, her come
back—such is the stuff screenplays arc made of.
Where this picture differs from most musical biog -
raphies is in its close adherence to fact.
By a feminine Parks-Jolson arrangement, Susan
Hayward is seen portraying the singer on the screen
while the charming voice of Miss Froman herself is
heard from the sound track. Between them, the two
ladies bring riew life to over two dozen old favorites,

notably "I'll Walk Alone," "Blue Moon," "They're
Either Too Young or Too Old." and the title song.
Actress Hay ward, happily rid of the hromidic
attitude she adopted to play Cathsheba, turns in a
sincere, beautifully modulated performance. She
is ably supported by David Wayne as her first hus
band, Rory Calhoun as her second, and Thelma
Hitter as her acid-tongued nurse and confidant.
Unfortunately, the picture is hampered by Lamarr
Trotti's screenplay. Two hours in length, it often
drags between songs. And although sentimentality
is held in surprising check, there are times—as dur
ing a patriotic medley in which a G.I. audience comes
close to resembling a Technicolor snake pit—when
things get out of hand. Furthermore, some of the
numbers, particularly in the early part of the picture,
are not staged so tastefully nor imaginatively as they
might have been.
Nevertheless, "With a Song in My Heart" is a
musical which is thoroughly enjoyable most of the
time. Many of its moments are genuinely moving.
In a time when vocalists seem either to moan or
twang, Miss Froman's sure, ringing way with a
lyric is eminently refreshing. A selection of her songs
from this film, incidentally, is available at the record
shops.
