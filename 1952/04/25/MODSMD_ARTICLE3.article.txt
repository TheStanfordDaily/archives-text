# Prison Riot Ends
## 
### 
JACKSON, Mich.â€”A bloody, five
day riot at Southern Michigan
Prison ended today when 171 grim
faccd mutineers gave up their cell
block fortress and eight hostage
guards in return for a steak dinner
and an 11-point reform program.
One by one the prisoners backed
out of the infamous Cell Block 15,
threw their weapons on the ground,
and marched to the dining hall SO
feet away for their "victory feast,"
which was part of their price for
the safety of the guards.
The surrender came just 16 hours
after Gov. G. Mennen Williams
bowed to the prisoners' reform de
mands to end the worst riot in his
tory at the world's largest walled
prison.
The prison reforms included bet
ter segregation of homosexuals,
elimination of alleged brutality, lib
eralized parole system, more "dis
ciplined" guards, and better medi
cal treatment.
