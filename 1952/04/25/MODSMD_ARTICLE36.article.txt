# Grant-in-Aid Applications Are Available to Students
## 
### 
Needy students who have en
countered unexpected financial dif
ficulties may now apply for assist
ance under the University's grants
in-aid program.
Each year a limited amount of
money is made available through
this program by the University and
by interested alumni. The only aca
demic qualification is that the stu
dent have a C average or better.
For the first time, this year ap
plications from graduate students
are being handled and processed
by the Dean of the Graduate Di
vision. Applications from under
graduates should be made at the
office of the Scholarship Commit
tee, to be reviewed by the Com
mission for Student Aid. They
may be made any time during the
quarter.
Awards are made primarily on
the basis of need; scholarship rec
ord is of secondary importance. In
assessing need, the Commission
give. l ; consideration to the amount
of family support available to the
student, the extent to which the
student is supporting himself, and
the extent to' which the student is
contributing to life in the Univer
sity community.
Grants rarely exceed $100. but
(hey represent outright gifts with
110 repayment obligations.
The applicants most likely to re
ceive favorable consideration are
those whose financial difficulties
have arisen as the result of some un
foreseen emergency. An honest
miscalculation of the amount of
work a student can handle in sup
porting himself is another valid rea
son, according to the Commission.
Applicants whose difficulties
stem from a failure to plan the
financing of their college career are
less likely to receive grant-in-aid
assistance.
