# GREATEST BLOW ON EARTH
## ORBUFFALO BILL'S SQUARE DEAL 
### 
In I In- duyss when it took a
real Composer to know a
Ciuee Note from a seventh
inverted minor ehord,
there was a Fresliman
named Orgatroyd wlio.«a
Aunt had told him the
Piano was the Fast Track

lo popularity on Campus anil thereafter. He
believed lier anil took lessons.
Being tone Deaf, Orgy kinked the Dash
hoard out ot the family Steinway over miss
ing a Coeducational Picnic in order to prac
tice "Forest Echoes", lri college, some other
Student with the ivory touch was alwa>s
iiiuking Orgy's Schubert sound like hydraulic
Brakes. This frustrated our Hoy. Next, he
met a Brunette. She was eohl to Cacophony
hut a Set-up for Sonnets. He look t» writin;*
her Sequences, for which he hod a gift. But
she was getting Mail hy the bushel. His
vaporing." were tossed out with the Bills.
Desperate, Orgy got. Then he saw a sign
that said "Just Call Western Union". His
next Sonnet hit the Brunette on a Yellow
Blank that even She could ■•ean. Her mother
invited Orgy Home for a Meeting. Today ho
is a Foreman in his Mate's Father's Cold
Boiled Mill.
From Matriculation to Old Age, there's
Magic in a Telegram. For whipping a Saw
buck from tin? Skipper, grabbing a Deathle-a
Date from the Jaws ot the Basketball < up
tuin, or heating a Business Rival to the Draw,
s Telegram does any Job quicker end better.

| ers always seem to .shoot superb
golf against the poker-faced State
champ. Last year Dick McElyea
tied him and beat him in the two
meets. This year at San Jose, Ven
j turi shot a G7, but Stanford's Fred
s Brown topped him with a spectac
ular 05.
The dubious distinction of trying
I to halt Venturi tomorrow will fall
on the shoulders of Brown, McEl
yea, or freshman Warren Dailey.
The Spartans are the only team
to defeat the Cards in dual meet
competition. The Spartans lost to
! Cal, however, and Stanford beat the
! Bears. Tomorrow's match should
: determine the best collegiate team
west of Texas.
i Other news from the golf front is

the return to form of la?t year's
number three man, Roland Conk tin.
The erratic Conkiin, who shoots
anything from (!5 to 90, has appar
ently found his game and may be
ready to break into the number six
spot by Saturday. He will battle
veteran Paul Palmquist and soph
slugger Grant Spaeth for the honor.
Number four man will probably
be Art Schroeder, and Dick Taylor
should open in number five spot.
The matches are free to the pub
lic, and a large crowd is expected to
follow the crowd-pleasing Venturi.
San Jo. e ako has many other fine
golfers. Veterans Bill King and
Wally Regan and newcomer Gordy
Williams all clobbered the Cards in
their last outing.
Today Stanford meets Cal at the
Mira Vista Club in Berkeley. If the
Cards win as expected, they will
have achieved a 4 and 0 PCC dual
meet record for the second straight
ypar. Stanford's team should be
Brown, McElyea, Dailey, Schroe
der, Taylor, and Palmquist or
Spaeth. Cal is led by Ted Engs and
Buck White. They shouldn't give
the Cards too much trouble.
The JV swingers will close out
their highly successful season with
a throe-way meet with Hartnell and
San Mateo JC.
