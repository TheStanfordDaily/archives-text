# WAA's Aim: To Serve Farm Women

### MARGARET DALGLIESH 
Mermaids have been practicing
all quarter for the forthcoming
Aquacade which is be presented
May 21 and 22. These arc all mem
bers of the Stanford Swim Club, a
part of the Women's Athletic Asso
ciation.
Whether you are a member of
Swim Club, Tennis Club, or Or
chesis you are a member of WAA.
This is one of the oldest organiza
tions here on campus and every
Stanford woman is a member.
WAA was formed to meet I he
needs of the women students to
further athletirs and dance activ
ities, and promote a spiri tof keen
competition, democracy and good
sportsmanship.
In all WAA sponsored activities
were organized on a club basis. To
day there are four honorary clubs
and numerous activities which are
open to all students. Even these
honorary clubs which have select
membership based on ability, bene
fit the whole campus.
Examples of these benefits have
been seen this quarter in the Or
chesis presentation of their danc
ing numbers. Swim Club will dis
play its talents in the Aquacade
next month when the members will
present original routines. This pro
gram is open to the public free of
charge.
Tennis Club is aho a closed group,
but it prevents tournaments which
arc not only open to Stanford wom
en but also to the men in the form
of mixed double games. There are
tournaments of this sort offered
during both fall and spring quar
ters.
Besides these clubs intramurals
also plav a vital part of the WAA
program. Volleyball fall quarter
and basketball in winter quarter
have been the two main sports
this year. Avid fans turned out
for both activities.
Usually the teams for these games
are from the various women's liv

ing groups. There were 43 teams
entered in the round-robin volley
ball tournament and an equal anion
ball tournament and an equal
amount of enthusiasms was shown
for the basketball. Games were
played three nights a week with
the winning team receiving a cup.
WAA also participates in and
sponsors intercollegiate sports days
in volleyball, basketball, hockey,
badminton, tennis, swimming, and
softball with the other Bay Area
colleges.
This year members from Cal,
Mills, San Francisco State, and San

J(K-:e State will join Stanford here
for the Bay Area Field Day on
May 10.
Special programs are planned
each year to orinet the freshmen
with the faciliites and opportunities
which are offered by WAA. For the
past two years a Freshman WAA
Board has existed and its purpose
is to further activiteis for the fresh
men.
This group works hand in hand
with the regular board which meets
every week to plan activities and
better the conditions of the athletic
association of Stanford women.


A DOLPHIN, A PORPOISE, A SUBMARINE—Which will fit?
After listening to records and trying out numerous routines, the
Swim Club has prepared its all-campus Spring Aquacade which
will be presented May 21 and 22. Members of the Water Ballet
class are now spending their time perfecting strokes and num
bers for "Platter Splatter," a show based on a disc jockey show
featuring swimming to all types of music.

After listening to records and trying out numerous routines, the
Swim Club has prepared its all-campus Spring Aquacade which
will be presented May 21 and 22. Members of the Water Ballet
class are now spending their time perfecting strokes and num
bers for "Platter Splatter," a show based on a disc jockey show
featuring swimming to all types of music.

Mermaids have been practicing
all quarter for the forthcoming
Aquacade which is be presented
May 21 and 22. These arc all mem
bers of the Stanford Swim Club, a
part of the Women's Athletic Asso
ciation.
Whether you are a member of
Swim Club, Tennis Club, or Or
chesis you are a member of WAA.
This is one of the oldest organiza
tions here on campus and every
Stanford woman is a member.
WAA was formed to meet I he
needs of the women students to
further athletirs and dance activ
ities, and promote a spiri tof keen
competition, democracy and good
sportsmanship.
In all WAA sponsored activities
were organized on a club basis. To
day there are four honorary clubs
and numerous activities which are
open to all students. Even these
honorary clubs which have select
membership based on ability, bene
fit the whole campus.
Examples of these benefits have
been seen this quarter in the Or
chesis presentation of their danc
ing numbers. Swim Club will dis
play its talents in the Aquacade
next month when the members will
present original routines. This pro
gram is open to the public free of
charge.
Tennis Club is aho a closed group,
but it prevents tournaments which
arc not only open to Stanford wom
en but also to the men in the form
of mixed double games. There are
tournaments of this sort offered
during both fall and spring quar
ters.
Besides these clubs intramurals
also plav a vital part of the WAA
program. Volleyball fall quarter
and basketball in winter quarter
have been the two main sports
this year. Avid fans turned out
for both activities.
Usually the teams for these games
are from the various women's liv

ing groups. There were 43 teams
entered in the round-robin volley
ball tournament and an equal anion
ball tournament and an equal
amount of enthusiasms was shown
for the basketball. Games were
played three nights a week with
the winning team receiving a cup.
WAA also participates in and
sponsors intercollegiate sports days
in volleyball, basketball, hockey,
badminton, tennis, swimming, and
softball with the other Bay Area
colleges.
This year members from Cal,
Mills, San Francisco State, and San

J(K-:e State will join Stanford here
for the Bay Area Field Day on
May 10.
Special programs are planned
each year to orinet the freshmen
with the faciliites and opportunities
which are offered by WAA. For the
past two years a Freshman WAA
Board has existed and its purpose
is to further activiteis for the fresh
men.
This group works hand in hand
with the regular board which meets
every week to plan activities and
better the conditions of the athletic
association of Stanford women.
