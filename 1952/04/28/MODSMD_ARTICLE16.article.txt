SAN FRANCISCO, April 27 (UP)
â€”Negotiators of the CIO Oil Work
ers' Union and Shell Oil Company
will meet again Tuesday in a final
attempt to avert a statewide oil
strike prior to a Wednesday mid
night deadline.
James Thornbury, international
union representative, said the Shell
meeting is the only local session
scheduled, although a strike also
would affect the Union Oil plant at
Rodeo, Standard Oil at Richmond,
and Associated Oil at Martinze.
