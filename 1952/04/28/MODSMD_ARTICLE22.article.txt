## 
### 
Frosh triumphed over the upper
class members of the Daily stall yes
terday and were able to put out this
edition of the Stanford Daily with
minor mishaps.
Following another of Stanford's
many traditions, the fun began
Friday when the Freshmen dis
covered that all the rollers had
been removed from the typewriters
in the Shack. Later in the day the
Shack was in a turmoil with tables
overturned, rnllcrless typewriters
gone, and other necessary items
cither missing or locked up.
Foresight of the Class of '55 staff
ers had provided a supply of copy
paper which had been secured dur
ing the previous week. Portable
typewriters had been secured in ad
vance also, just in case they might

j be needed.
Under the direction of Ruth
Jahnke, editor of this issue, plans
were made to put out the paper
without using the Shack as the
| center of operation. The wire
1 editor and three copy readers were
the only members of the Frosh
Staff to enter the Shack.
These students manned the phones
i and the teletype machine so as to
receive all incoming news. The rest
of the staff worked in a previously
designated area checking all copy
for mistakes and false material
handed in by upper classmen.
The evening ended in a paint party
at the Shack when each triumphant
Frosh was permitted to add his sig
nature to the already crowded walls
and ceiling.
