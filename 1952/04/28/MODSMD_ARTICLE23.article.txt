## 
### ED FORNER 
"No finer pianist has been heard
in San Francisco this season than
Roy Bogas," said the Call-Bulletin
of a recital given Friday night in
the Marine Theater by a Stanford
freshman.
Bogas is not new to the Farm au
diences, however, having performed
in the chambcr music series.
While at the San Francisco Con
servatory of Music in 1948 he ap
peared in concert with the San
Francisco Symphony playing the
Shostakovich conccrto for piano
and orchestra.
Bogas now holds the Hertz Music
Scholarship and a Stanford schol
arship.
Besides his activities as a piano
soloist, Roy Bogas has been quite
active in chamber music circles. He
studied for several summers with
the noted Grille;- Quartet, perform
ing such works as the difficult Bloch
quintet, which was presented at
Santa Barbara in 1949 for the com
poser.
While at Stanford he has per
formed two Beethoven trios in the
chamber music serie.s, and will per
form the Schubert "Trout" quintet
on May 11. Bogas i.s also quite pro
ficient at composing chamber music.
He has won three prizes with his
compositions, notable among which
is a woodwind trio.
Not to be entirely confined to the
limits of a piano keyboard, Bogas
is a member of the Stanford Sym
phony Orchestra in which hâ„¢ plays
the tympani. He also dabbles in
clnrinot and viola work.
Beginning his musical career at
the age of five in his home town
of New York, he first, studied with
Madame Telwig Rosenthal. Since
1945 h:> has been at the San Fran
cisco Conservatory of Music, where
he studied with Ada Clement on
piano and Lillian Hodghead in the
ory. At present he js studying with
Adolph Bailer in Palo Alto. Bogas
works on the grand piano owned
! y the late Marv Crowley, which
he won in a competition sponsored
by the Pacific Music Club.
With the start that he has al
ready made, young Bogas will have
little trouble in realizing his ambi
tion of being a concert artist of first
rank.
