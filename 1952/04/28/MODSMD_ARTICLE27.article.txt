# Record Vote Seen In Massachusetts

### 
BOSTON, April 27 (UP)â€”A rec
ord vote by more than 300,000 per
sons was forecast today in Massa
chusetts presidential primary Tues
day to resolve a bitter state battle
between backers of Sen. Robert A.
Taft and Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Though the names of Taft and
Eisenhower and other prospective
presidential candidates will not be
on the primary ballot, political ob
servers will watch with keen in- ;
terest the preferential "write - in"
vote.
Ostensibly, the principal battle will j
center around the contest for the 28
Republican district delegate scats for
which the supporters of Taft and
Eisenhower have waged intensive j
campaigns. An additional 10 un- i
opposed GOP at-largc delegates |
comprise a "harmony" ticket rep
resenting supporters of both leading
candidates.
No clear-cut fight, shaped up in j
the Democratic balloting since the
regulars, who were nearly unani- |
mous in their support of President
Truman, were left without a can- |
didate when he withdrew. How- j
ever. Sen. Estcs Kefauver of Tennes
see had handful of convention can
didates entered against regular Dem- j
ocrats.
