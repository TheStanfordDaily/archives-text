# Activities Need Weeding Out
## 
### 
"Strawberry Brunch? What's that?" That
reaction was typical of freshman girls when
asked to sign up as hostesses. They hadn't
heard of it before, and they failed to see the
significance of the major contribution of the
freshmen to the Con Home Drive. Such situa
tions indicate the confusion caused by too
many activities spring quarter.
There have been so many lists to sign, proj
ects to work on, and places to go that by the
time something really worthwhile and fun
comes up, like Con Home Week, the students
are weary and apathetic. The result is poor
turnouts for activities in general, and the whole
campus suffers.
One solution to the problem would be elimi
nation of "traditional" affairs like Back to the
Farm Week and rescheduling of the approved
ones. To begin with, Back to the Farm Week
is not a tradition. Students have observed it
only spasmodically during the last decade,
and it was almost unheard of before that. The■
affair is generally considered to have flopped
for the last two years. As for this year, every
man may draw his own conclusion, but the
fieshmen could be counted on Quad Thurs
day. They were the only ones in farmish
clothes.
The Water Carnival and the Cal-Frosh Ex
change are both fine activities. But each one
suffers when they are scheduled for the same
weekend. That happened this year. The upper
classmen probably didn't notice it, but the
freshmen are tiring of the pressure they are
continually under. The general attitude recent
ly has been one of "let the freshmen do it." On
the whole they've done the jobs given them,

but how long will they continue to?
Big all-campus activities should be planned
so that only the really traditional, really good
ones stay. As it stands now, every committee
and organization feels free to initiate an ac
tivity to further its own ends, no matter how
many other affairs are being planned. Living
groups have trouble arranging their activities
along with the other large organizations on
campus.
If this short-sighted method ot cramming
the calendar continues much longer, the fu
ture will see a student body that can't be
moved for the worthiest of causes.
Excom is the only part of Stanford student
government that can handle this situation ade
quately. Perhaps through investigation and
discussion means can be devised to renovate
the program of activities throughout the school
year, spring quarter in particular. If that can
be accomplished, Stanford students will get
the most out of campus activities and campus
activities will receive more from Stanford stu
dents.

campus.
If this short-sighted method ot cramming
the calendar continues much longer, the fu
ture will see a student body that can't be
moved for the worthiest of causes.
Excom is the only part of Stanford student
government that can handle this situation ade
quately. Perhaps through investigation and
discussion means can be devised to renovate
the program of activities throughout the school
year, spring quarter in particular. If that can
be accomplished, Stanford students will get
the most out of campus activities and campus
activities will receive more from Stanford stu
dents.
"Strawberry Brunch? What's that?" That
reaction was typical of freshman girls when
asked to sign up as hostesses. They hadn't
heard of it before, and they failed to see the
significance of the major contribution of the
freshmen to the Con Home Drive. Such situa
tions indicate the confusion caused by too
many activities spring quarter.
There have been so many lists to sign, proj
ects to work on, and places to go that by the
time something really worthwhile and fun
comes up, like Con Home Week, the students
are weary and apathetic. The result is poor
turnouts for activities in general, and the whole
campus suffers.
One solution to the problem would be elimi
nation of "traditional" affairs like Back to the
Farm Week and rescheduling of the approved
ones. To begin with, Back to the Farm Week
is not a tradition. Students have observed it
only spasmodically during the last decade,
and it was almost unheard of before that. The■
affair is generally considered to have flopped
for the last two years. As for this year, every
man may draw his own conclusion, but the
fieshmen could be counted on Quad Thurs
day. They were the only ones in farmish
clothes.
The Water Carnival and the Cal-Frosh Ex
change are both fine activities. But each one
suffers when they are scheduled for the same
weekend. That happened this year. The upper
classmen probably didn't notice it, but the
freshmen are tiring of the pressure they are
continually under. The general attitude recent
ly has been one of "let the freshmen do it." On
the whole they've done the jobs given them,

but how long will they continue to?
Big all-campus activities should be planned
so that only the really traditional, really good
ones stay. As it stands now, every committee
and organization feels free to initiate an ac
tivity to further its own ends, no matter how
many other affairs are being planned. Living
groups have trouble arranging their activities
along with the other large organizations on
campus.
