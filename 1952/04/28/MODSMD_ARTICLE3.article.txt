### 
TOKYO, Monday, April 28 (UP) |
â€”Japan regains her sovereignty at J
10:30 p.m. today (6:30 a.m. PST) ;
when the Allied ocupation comes to (
an end, but a wave of unofficial eel- I
ebrations swept the country hours!
in advance.
No formal mass celebration was |
scheduled, but the end of the occu
pation appeared to give the Japa
nese new self-respect and a feel
ing of equality that lay dormant j
through the occupation. Many of
the swinging and swaying revelers
were seen laughing and talking j
with American soldiers.
Under a mutual defense pact, Ja- 1
pan and the United States become j
allies when the occupation ends and
American military forces will rc- ;
main here at the request of the
Japanese to protect Japan from in
vasion.
