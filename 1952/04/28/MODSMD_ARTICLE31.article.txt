This space is devoted to Freshmen, especially the
Green and Gullible ones. My purpose being to let the
Freshmen know why they should be proud of their
school, the subject is "Famous People Who Have
Been at Stanford."
For instance, Shakespeare. In an inspired moment
following a Western Civ final, he dashed off the
"Quality of Mercy" piece in the Merchant of Venire.

And T. S. Eliot has been con
demning April ever since he
flunked Spring Quarter.
It was in Spring, too, that Lil'
Abner met Daisy Mae at the
Cellar over an ice cold glass of
buttermilk. Daisy, with that
Cactus Garden look in her eye,
came up to Lil' Abner, and their
conservation went something like
this:

"Howdy thar, Lil' Abnr. 'Member me.' As was in
youah zymurgy class last quartah. What'd you get
on youah final?" (co-eds never change.)
"Ah flunked."
"Gawsh, Ah guess that's the way it goes."
"Yup, that's the way the big bawl bounces."
(By the way, I think Daisy' Cactus Garden look
is a better explanation of why Lil' Abner got married
than the one A 1 Capp gives.)
It isn't only in the literary work! that Stanford has
turned out Famous People. George Washington was
an old Stanford grad. In fact, the only reason the

Constitution was adopted rather than the Fundamen
tal Standard is that the Senate was composed of
Cal men. Those days were hectic days for the
country.
Houdini spent five months doing Graduate Work on
the Farm. His copious notes on making things ap
pear out of nothing have been put to good use by
various Encina-ites at various lectures in Mem Aud.
However, Houdini met up with the only failure in
his long career here on the Farm. He never dis
covered how to get into Roble after closing hours.
Stanford has also had its list of firsts. The first
Aardvark roamed happily up and do\yn Geology cor
ner, nipping at the heels of Passing Professors, until
University authorities (undoubtedly bribed by Pass
ing Professors) declared him unsanitary under sec
tion four of the Fundamental Standard. Rumor has
it that when the unhappy Aardvark heard the edict,
he, heartbroken, hanged himself in a deep corner
of the Stacks. But then again this may be mere Uni
versity propaganda, invented to explain the recently
excavated bones of a Lost Student.
It has definitely been proved, though, that the first
Stoic was a Stanford professor; that the first Dog had
its first snack at the Cellar (they've been coming
back ever since); that the first Umbrella was opened
here during Winter Quarter; and that Adam was the
first Rough.
Now, Freshmen, especially Green and Gullible ones,
you see what lies behind—way behind—you. Bigger
and brighter things are yet to corrte!
