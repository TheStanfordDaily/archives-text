## Irate Donor Calls Blood Drive a Flop 
### 
To the Editor:
1 read in today's Daily (Ed. note: April 24 issue)
of the "successful blood drive" in which a paltry 450
pints of blood were contributed by a student body
of between six and seven thousand. Disgraceful By
what stretch of the imagination could such a showing
be called successful?
In Japan, Allied military and civilian men, and
women too, contribute cheerfully every two months,
not every six months as we do on the Stanford cam
pus. Men not actually fighting on the front lines in
Korea reportedly contribute their blood in their
spare time when they are not offering their lives on
the battlefield to protect our freedom.
Those who contribute in these places expect no
one to hold their hahd "lest they faint alter the
bleeding" or to tell them what a sacrifice they've
made. Nor do many, if any, wear the little badge to
symbolize that they gave. To them giving blood is
a reciprocal opportunity to help their fellow soldiers
when they need blood.
We who contributed a trifling pint of blood to the
drive this week have made a very small sacrifice
indeed—most of us didn't notice the slightest ill-eflect
—at most we contributed an hour of our time.
The Stanford student body as a whole appears to
be a group of "red-blooded Americans" if one can
judge by the rosy-cheeked crowds that chase hither
and yon on the campus day after day, dash ofT to the
lake for a swim, fill the football stadium with savage
yells in the fall, and expend untold energies on the
thousand and one campus activities that occupy their
time.
There is much talk on the campus by faculty and
students alike about how we must "do our bit," and
"fight for democracy" and "help the boys in Korea."
Hut words are of little avail in the fight against Com
munist aggression in which our country and the free
nations of the world are now engaged.

We who gave blood this week cannot relax and
"be proud for the rest of our lives lor what we have
done today," but rather should we mark on our calen
dars the earliest date at which we can again donate,
then make sure we "give another pint. Meanwhile we
are obligated to do what we can to awaken those
students and faculty members who dare to ignore
their opportunity and obligation to participate ac
tively in the cause of freedom.
Such unabashed apathy as was exhibited this week
by the so-called "cream of the crop" and "future
lenders of our democracy" is absolutely inexcusable!

To the Editor:
1 read in today's Daily (Ed. note: April 24 issue)
of the "successful blood drive" in which a paltry 450
pints of blood were contributed by a student body
of between six and seven thousand. Disgraceful By
what stretch of the imagination could such a showing
be called successful?
In Japan, Allied military and civilian men, and
women too, contribute cheerfully every two months,
not every six months as we do on the Stanford cam
pus. Men not actually fighting on the front lines in
Korea reportedly contribute their blood in their
spare time when they are not offering their lives on
the battlefield to protect our freedom.
Those who contribute in these places expect no
one to hold their hahd "lest they faint alter the
bleeding" or to tell them what a sacrifice they've
made. Nor do many, if any, wear the little badge to
symbolize that they gave. To them giving blood is
a reciprocal opportunity to help their fellow soldiers
when they need blood.
We who contributed a trifling pint of blood to the
drive this week have made a very small sacrifice
indeed—most of us didn't notice the slightest ill-eflect
—at most we contributed an hour of our time.
The Stanford student body as a whole appears to
be a group of "red-blooded Americans" if one can
judge by the rosy-cheeked crowds that chase hither
and yon on the campus day after day, dash ofT to the
lake for a swim, fill the football stadium with savage
yells in the fall, and expend untold energies on the
thousand and one campus activities that occupy their
time.
There is much talk on the campus by faculty and
students alike about how we must "do our bit," and
"fight for democracy" and "help the boys in Korea."
Hut words are of little avail in the fight against Com
munist aggression in which our country and the free
nations of the world are now engaged.

We who gave blood this week cannot relax and
"be proud for the rest of our lives lor what we have
done today," but rather should we mark on our calen
dars the earliest date at which we can again donate,
then make sure we "give another pint. Meanwhile we
are obligated to do what we can to awaken those
students and faculty members who dare to ignore
their opportunity and obligation to participate ac
tively in the cause of freedom.
Such unabashed apathy as was exhibited this week
by the so-called "cream of the crop" and "future
lenders of our democracy" is absolutely inexcusable!
