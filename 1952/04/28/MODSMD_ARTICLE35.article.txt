# Student Deferment Procedure Outlined
## 
### 
(Editor's note: The first of four
stories outlining the current draft
situation to Stanford men, the fol
lowing is directed to those who are
IS or who are about to have their
18th birthday. It is based upon the
latest information obtained from
the Chief Counselor for Men, Kit-h
-ard L. Balch.)
The following is a review of the
Selective Service procedure now in
use by most draft boards throughout
the country with regard to men who
have reached 18 years of age, the
initial draft eligible age.
Registration with a local draft
board is the initial step in the pro
cedure and must be accomplished
within five days of the 18th birth
day. A man's local draft l>oard is the
one which has jurisdiction over his
permanent home address.
It is the responsibility of the man
to register as well as to notify his
board of any subsequent change, of
address or alteration in status which
may affect his classification.
Once registered, an 18-year-old
Sam Stanford will receive from his
local board a Selective Service class
ification questionnaire. It is impor
tant that this questionnaire be ac
curately and completely filled out
since it will be a basis for a man's
college student classification.
On the basis of the questionnaire
most men will be classified 1-A." If
a student informs his draft board he
is currently registered in the Uni
versity, there is no reason for alarm
at this 1-A classification.
An 18-year-old interested in de
ferment should then make arrange
ments to take the Selective Service
Qualification Test the next time it is
scheduled to be given.
There is nothing else a man need
do or can do about his deferment
until he completes his academic year
or is ordered to report for a pre
induction physical exam, whichever
comes earlier.
If called for a physical, he must

report at the time and place specified
or apply at the local draft board
nearest to his temporary college ad
dress for transfer of the exam.
After a man who is desirous of
deferment has taken his physical or
has completed his academic year
(again, whichever comes earlier) lie
should write his local board request
ing deferment. A copy of any and all
correspondence with the board
should be kept for his own records.
Secondly, he should request the
University to send his local board
a ' : 109 Form." This will automatic
ally be done if the questionnaire
which Stanford will send to all draft
eligible students within the next
two weeks is properly filled out and
returned. (See the Daily, April 24).
The 109 Form will give a certified
list of a man's l'ank in his class,
broken down by Department or
School in the University based on
the current academic year's grades.
The Registrar's office will have this
form in the hands of the local draft
board sometime between August 1
and August 15.
After a man has applied for a
deferment, taken the Selective Serv
ice Test, and had the University send
a 109 Form to his local board, there
is nothing further he can do re
garding his deferment.
If not granted a deferment, a man
will remain in Class 1-A until or
dered to report for induction.
If anyone is classified by local
board and then feels he is entitled
to a classification different than the
one given him, he may appeal this
classification.
Such appeals must be made in
writing and be filed with the local
board within 10 days from the day
the classification notice was mailed
to him.
Tomorrow: Explanation of de
ferment criteria and classifications,
and method of reopening cases of
students older than 18.

After a man who is desirous of
deferment has taken his physical or
has completed his academic year
(again, whichever comes earlier) lie
should write his local board request
ing deferment. A copy of any and all
correspondence with the board
should be kept for his own records.
Secondly, he should request the
University to send his local board
a ' : 109 Form." This will automatic
ally be done if the questionnaire
which Stanford will send to all draft
eligible students within the next
two weeks is properly filled out and
returned. (See the Daily, April 24).
The 109 Form will give a certified
list of a man's l'ank in his class,
broken down by Department or
School in the University based on
the current academic year's grades.
The Registrar's office will have this
form in the hands of the local draft
board sometime between August 1
and August 15.
After a man has applied for a
deferment, taken the Selective Serv
ice Test, and had the University send
a 109 Form to his local board, there
is nothing further he can do re
garding his deferment.
If not granted a deferment, a man
will remain in Class 1-A until or
dered to report for induction.
If anyone is classified by local
board and then feels he is entitled
to a classification different than the
one given him, he may appeal this
classification.
Such appeals must be made in
writing and be filed with the local
board within 10 days from the day
the classification notice was mailed
to him.

stories outlining the current draft
situation to Stanford men, the fol

The following is a review of the
Selective Service procedure now in
use by most draft boards throughout
the country with regard to men who
have reached 18 years of age, the
initial draft eligible age.
Registration with a local draft
board is the initial step in the pro
cedure and must be accomplished
within five days of the 18th birth
day. A man's local draft l>oard is the
one which has jurisdiction over his
permanent home address.
It is the responsibility of the man
to register as well as to notify his
board of any subsequent change, of
address or alteration in status which
may affect his classification.
Once registered, an 18-year-old
Sam Stanford will receive from his
local board a Selective Service class
ification questionnaire. It is impor
tant that this questionnaire be ac
curately and completely filled out
since it will be a basis for a man's
college student classification.
On the basis of the questionnaire
most men will be classified 1-A." If
a student informs his draft board he
is currently registered in the Uni
versity, there is no reason for alarm
at this 1-A classification.
An 18-year-old interested in de
ferment should then make arrange
ments to take the Selective Service
Qualification Test the next time it is
scheduled to be given.
There is nothing else a man need
do or can do about his deferment
until he completes his academic year
or is ordered to report for a pre
induction physical exam, whichever
comes earlier.
If called for a physical, he must

report at the time and place specified
or apply at the local draft board
nearest to his temporary college ad
dress for transfer of the exam.
After a man who is desirous of
deferment has taken his physical or
has completed his academic year
