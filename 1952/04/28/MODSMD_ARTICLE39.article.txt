# Parson, Mathias, Reed Lead Cardinals To 79-52 Track Victory Over Oxy
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
Sweeping three events and placing
one-two in a pair of others, the Stan
ford track team rolled to a surpris
ingly easy 79-52 victory over Occi
dental Saturday, in a meet that left
little doubt as to which school pres
ently has the best cinder squad.
Occidental, on the other hand, was
unable to sweep a single event, and
only in the pole vault, 440, and mile
were they able to take both first and
second places. Except for a few mo
ments at the opening of the meet
the visitors never held a lead. In a
number of the primary events Oxy
seemed to threaten the Indian su
premacy with a few unexpected
she nvings, but later in the day Stan
ford maneuvered a few upsets them
selves.
The Tigers pulled a number of
surprise moves. The first of these
was the entering of Sherman Miller
in the 220 and 440 events. The
sprinter had a pulled muscle and
was labeled a "highly doubted par
ticipant," being left off the pre-meet
dope sheets. In his first event, the
440, he looked as good as ever streak
ing to a first in the fast time of :48.7.
In the 220, though, he had not
reckoned with Maury Parsons, In
dian speedster. Parson took an easy
first in that event, as he did in the
100. He was one of three trackmen
to score ten points, along with Bob
Mathias and Oxy's John Barnes.
Another of the surprises pulled
Saturday by the Tigers was a one
two in the mile run. Barnes and Bob
McMillen raced neck-and-neck to
the wire to both edge out Bob Simon.
Still another surprise was a third in
the shot put by Ken Hoffman, an
event the Indians had expected to
sweep. Hoffman bettered his all
time mark with a 47-foot heave,
while two Stanford athletes put on
quite a show for top honors.
Chuck Hokanson, who has had to
be satisfied with second-place honors
most of the season, gave a tremen
dous heave of 52 feet 8 inches, better
than any Indian has done so far this
season, and topping his seasonal mark
by a full 14 inches. Not to be out
done, Howie Hertz, Hokanson's team
mate-rival, heaved a toss of 52' 10"
to again grab the top spot. Needless
to say, both tosses were far beyond
those of any competitors.
Besides these surprises, the Tigers'
Adnah Frain vaulted 13 feet to place
behind teammate Dick Shivers for a
one-two in this event.
Stanford, however, came up with
a number of upsets of their own.
Chief among them was Barnes' 10
point gathering, and a sophomore
named Gerry Wood. Wood, unheard
of by most track fans, came from the
Indian JV squad to enter in the
hurdles events. He took a second in
the highs behind Bob Mathias, and a
third in the lows to score four un
expected but useful tallies.
Another pleasant surprise for In
dian coach Jack Weiershauser was
a victory by Bob Reed in the two
mile run. Tiger ace Bob McMillen,
who was expected to cop the event,
was left in the dust almost at the
starting gun by the small freshman,
and never seriously challenged.
Reed and Wood gave Stanford fans
optimistic hope for the next two
seasons.
Keith Brownsberger took a third
in the 100 yard dash behind Parsons
and Bob Magee, to add another un
expected sweep to the Stanford,
cause. Brownsberger is also a frosh.
As was expected, the Indians swept
the discus with their usual trio of
Mathias, Chuck Renfro, and lan
Reed. The other sweep was in the
javelin, where Leo Long, Bob Kim
ball, and Chuck Harlow also breezed
to victory.
It is unusual for any report of a
Stanford track meet to get this far
without any more mention of Ma
thias than the events he entered. But
it can truely be said that for the first
time in Staurday's meet the services
of the decathlon champion were not
needed. In one of the events he won,
Stanford took second, while sweep
ing the other. He did not place in
the pole vault.
A dropped stick helped give the
Indian relay squad a victory in the
mile event for another unexpected
live points. The opening men, Don
Carlson and Hal Butler, battled
evenly, and then Oxy's John Barnes
pulled ahead of Stan Dawson in the
second lap. Then, near the end,
Barnes lost his stick, giving Dawson
a 40-foot lead. The final Stanford
men, John Woolley and Bill Fried
richs, were able to hold the lead.

a victory by Bob Reed in the two
mile run. Tiger ace Bob McMillen,
who was expected to cop the event,
was left in the dust almost at the
starting gun by the small freshman,
and never seriously challenged.
Reed and Wood gave Stanford fans
optimistic hope for the next two
seasons.
Keith Brownsberger took a third
in the 100 yard dash behind Parsons
and Bob Magee, to add another un
expected sweep to the Stanford,
cause. Brownsberger is also a frosh.
As was expected, the Indians swept
the discus with their usual trio of
Mathias, Chuck Renfro, and lan
Reed. The other sweep was in the
javelin, where Leo Long, Bob Kim
ball, and Chuck Harlow also breezed
to victory.
It is unusual for any report of a
Stanford track meet to get this far
without any more mention of Ma
thias than the events he entered. But
it can truely be said that for the first
time in Staurday's meet the services
of the decathlon champion were not
needed. In one of the events he won,
Stanford took second, while sweep
ing the other. He did not place in
the pole vault.
A dropped stick helped give the
Indian relay squad a victory in the
mile event for another unexpected
live points. The opening men, Don
Carlson and Hal Butler, battled
evenly, and then Oxy's John Barnes
pulled ahead of Stan Dawson in the
second lap. Then, near the end,
Barnes lost his stick, giving Dawson
a 40-foot lead. The final Stanford
men, John Woolley and Bill Fried
richs, were able to hold the lead.

FLYING INDIAN—Stocky Maury Parsons literally flies home
for his second win of the day in the 220. His time of 21.5 sec
onds was his best effort of the season. Parsons earlier won the
100 in 9.8. Oxy's Sherman Miller is shown finishing second

Sweeping three events and placing
one-two in a pair of others, the Stan
ford track team rolled to a surpris
ingly easy 79-52 victory over Occi
dental Saturday, in a meet that left
little doubt as to which school pres
ently has the best cinder squad.
Occidental, on the other hand, was
unable to sweep a single event, and
only in the pole vault, 440, and mile
were they able to take both first and
second places. Except for a few mo
ments at the opening of the meet
the visitors never held a lead. In a
number of the primary events Oxy
seemed to threaten the Indian su
premacy with a few unexpected
she nvings, but later in the day Stan
ford maneuvered a few upsets them
selves.
The Tigers pulled a number of
surprise moves. The first of these
was the entering of Sherman Miller
in the 220 and 440 events. The
sprinter had a pulled muscle and
was labeled a "highly doubted par
ticipant," being left off the pre-meet
dope sheets. In his first event, the
440, he looked as good as ever streak
ing to a first in the fast time of :48.7.
In the 220, though, he had not
reckoned with Maury Parsons, In
dian speedster. Parson took an easy
first in that event, as he did in the
100. He was one of three trackmen
to score ten points, along with Bob
Mathias and Oxy's John Barnes.
Another of the surprises pulled
Saturday by the Tigers was a one
two in the mile run. Barnes and Bob
McMillen raced neck-and-neck to
the wire to both edge out Bob Simon.
Still another surprise was a third in
the shot put by Ken Hoffman, an
event the Indians had expected to
sweep. Hoffman bettered his all
time mark with a 47-foot heave,
while two Stanford athletes put on
quite a show for top honors.
Chuck Hokanson, who has had to
be satisfied with second-place honors
most of the season, gave a tremen
dous heave of 52 feet 8 inches, better
than any Indian has done so far this
season, and topping his seasonal mark
by a full 14 inches. Not to be out
done, Howie Hertz, Hokanson's team
mate-rival, heaved a toss of 52' 10"
to again grab the top spot. Needless
to say, both tosses were far beyond
those of any competitors.
Besides these surprises, the Tigers'
Adnah Frain vaulted 13 feet to place
behind teammate Dick Shivers for a
one-two in this event.
Stanford, however, came up with
a number of upsets of their own.
Chief among them was Barnes' 10
point gathering, and a sophomore
named Gerry Wood. Wood, unheard
of by most track fans, came from the
Indian JV squad to enter in the
hurdles events. He took a second in
the highs behind Bob Mathias, and a
third in the lows to score four un
expected but useful tallies.
Another pleasant surprise for In

a victory by Bob Reed in the two
mile run. Tiger ace Bob McMillen,

FLYING INDIAN—Stocky Maury Parsons literally flies home
for his second win of the day in the 220. His time of 21.5 sec
onds was his best effort of the season. Parsons earlier won the
100 in 9.8. Oxy's Sherman Miller is shown finishing second

Sweeping three events and placing
one-two in a pair of others, the Stan
ford track team rolled to a surpris
ingly easy 79-52 victory over Occi
dental Saturday, in a meet that left
little doubt as to which school pres
ently has the best cinder squad.
Occidental, on the other hand, was
unable to sweep a single event, and
only in the pole vault, 440, and mile
were they able to take both first and
second places. Except for a few mo
ments at the opening of the meet
the visitors never held a lead. In a
number of the primary events Oxy
seemed to threaten the Indian su
premacy with a few unexpected
she nvings, but later in the day Stan
ford maneuvered a few upsets them
selves.
The Tigers pulled a number of
surprise moves. The first of these
was the entering of Sherman Miller
in the 220 and 440 events. The
sprinter had a pulled muscle and
was labeled a "highly doubted par
ticipant," being left off the pre-meet
dope sheets. In his first event, the
440, he looked as good as ever streak
ing to a first in the fast time of :48.7.
In the 220, though, he had not
reckoned with Maury Parsons, In
dian speedster. Parson took an easy
first in that event, as he did in the
100. He was one of three trackmen
to score ten points, along with Bob
Mathias and Oxy's John Barnes.
Another of the surprises pulled
Saturday by the Tigers was a one
two in the mile run. Barnes and Bob
McMillen raced neck-and-neck to
the wire to both edge out Bob Simon.
Still another surprise was a third in
the shot put by Ken Hoffman, an
event the Indians had expected to
sweep. Hoffman bettered his all
time mark with a 47-foot heave,
while two Stanford athletes put on
quite a show for top honors.
Chuck Hokanson, who has had to
be satisfied with second-place honors
most of the season, gave a tremen
dous heave of 52 feet 8 inches, better
than any Indian has done so far this
season, and topping his seasonal mark
by a full 14 inches. Not to be out
done, Howie Hertz, Hokanson's team
mate-rival, heaved a toss of 52' 10"
to again grab the top spot. Needless
to say, both tosses were far beyond
those of any competitors.
Besides these surprises, the Tigers'
Adnah Frain vaulted 13 feet to place
behind teammate Dick Shivers for a
one-two in this event.
Stanford, however, came up with
a number of upsets of their own.
Chief among them was Barnes' 10
point gathering, and a sophomore
named Gerry Wood. Wood, unheard
of by most track fans, came from the
Indian JV squad to enter in the
hurdles events. He took a second in
the highs behind Bob Mathias, and a
third in the lows to score four un
expected but useful tallies.
Another pleasant surprise for In
dian coach Jack Weiershauser was
a victory by Bob Reed in the two
mile run. Tiger ace Bob McMillen,
who was expected to cop the event,
was left in the dust almost at the
starting gun by the small freshman,
and never seriously challenged.
Reed and Wood gave Stanford fans
optimistic hope for the next two
seasons.
Keith Brownsberger took a third
in the 100 yard dash behind Parsons
and Bob Magee, to add another un
expected sweep to the Stanford,
cause. Brownsberger is also a frosh.
As was expected, the Indians swept
the discus with their usual trio of
Mathias, Chuck Renfro, and lan
Reed. The other sweep was in the
javelin, where Leo Long, Bob Kim
ball, and Chuck Harlow also breezed
to victory.
It is unusual for any report of a
Stanford track meet to get this far
without any more mention of Ma
thias than the events he entered. But
it can truely be said that for the first
time in Staurday's meet the services
of the decathlon champion were not
needed. In one of the events he won,
Stanford took second, while sweep
ing the other. He did not place in
the pole vault.
A dropped stick helped give the
Indian relay squad a victory in the
mile event for another unexpected
live points. The opening men, Don
Carlson and Hal Butler, battled
evenly, and then Oxy's John Barnes
pulled ahead of Stan Dawson in the
second lap. Then, near the end,
Barnes lost his stick, giving Dawson
a 40-foot lead. The final Stanford
men, John Woolley and Bill Fried
richs, were able to hold the lead.

done, Howie Hertz, Hokanson's team
mate-rival, heaved a toss of 52' 10"
to again grab the top spot. Needless
to say, both tosses were far beyond
those of any competitors.
Besides these surprises, the Tigers'
Adnah Frain vaulted 13 feet to place
behind teammate Dick Shivers for a
one-two in this event.
Stanford, however, came up with
a number of upsets of their own.
Chief among them was Barnes' 10
point gathering, and a sophomore
named Gerry Wood. Wood, unheard
of by most track fans, came from the
Indian JV squad to enter in the
hurdles events. He took a second in
the highs behind Bob Mathias, and a
third in the lows to score four un
expected but useful tallies.
Another pleasant surprise for In
dian coach Jack Weiershauser was
a victory by Bob Reed in the two
mile run. Tiger ace Bob McMillen,
who was expected to cop the event,
was left in the dust almost at the
starting gun by the small freshman,
and never seriously challenged.
Reed and Wood gave Stanford fans
optimistic hope for the next two
seasons.
Keith Brownsberger took a third
in the 100 yard dash behind Parsons
and Bob Magee, to add another un
expected sweep to the Stanford,
cause. Brownsberger is also a frosh.
As was expected, the Indians swept
the discus with their usual trio of
Mathias, Chuck Renfro, and lan
Reed. The other sweep was in the
javelin, where Leo Long, Bob Kim
ball, and Chuck Harlow also breezed
to victory.
It is unusual for any report of a
Stanford track meet to get this far
without any more mention of Ma
thias than the events he entered. But
it can truely be said that for the first
time in Staurday's meet the services
of the decathlon champion were not
needed. In one of the events he won,
Stanford took second, while sweep
ing the other. He did not place in
the pole vault.
A dropped stick helped give the
Indian relay squad a victory in the
mile event for another unexpected
live points. The opening men, Don
Carlson and Hal Butler, battled
evenly, and then Oxy's John Barnes
pulled ahead of Stan Dawson in the
second lap. Then, near the end,
Barnes lost his stick, giving Dawson
a 40-foot lead. The final Stanford
men, John Woolley and Bill Fried
richs, were able to hold the lead.

FLYING INDIAN—Stocky Maury Parsons literally flies home
for his second win of the day in the 220. His time of 21.5 sec
onds was his best effort of the season. Parsons earlier won the
100 in 9.8. Oxy's Sherman Miller is shown finishing second
behind Parsons. Keith Brownsberger, Stanford freshman, not

Sweeping three events and placing
one-two in a pair of others, the Stan
ford track team rolled to a surpris
ingly easy 79-52 victory over Occi
dental Saturday, in a meet that left
little doubt as to which school pres
ently has the best cinder squad.
Occidental, on the other hand, was
unable to sweep a single event, and
only in the pole vault, 440, and mile
were they able to take both first and
second places. Except for a few mo
ments at the opening of the meet
the visitors never held a lead. In a
number of the primary events Oxy
seemed to threaten the Indian su
premacy with a few unexpected
she nvings, but later in the day Stan
ford maneuvered a few upsets them
selves.
The Tigers pulled a number of
surprise moves. The first of these
was the entering of Sherman Miller
in the 220 and 440 events. The
sprinter had a pulled muscle and
was labeled a "highly doubted par
ticipant," being left off the pre-meet
dope sheets. In his first event, the
440, he looked as good as ever streak
ing to a first in the fast time of :48.7.
In the 220, though, he had not
reckoned with Maury Parsons, In
dian speedster. Parson took an easy
first in that event, as he did in the
100. He was one of three trackmen
to score ten points, along with Bob
Mathias and Oxy's John Barnes.
Another of the surprises pulled
Saturday by the Tigers was a one
two in the mile run. Barnes and Bob
McMillen raced neck-and-neck to
the wire to both edge out Bob Simon.
Still another surprise was a third in
the shot put by Ken Hoffman, an
event the Indians had expected to
sweep. Hoffman bettered his all
time mark with a 47-foot heave,
while two Stanford athletes put on
quite a show for top honors.
Chuck Hokanson, who has had to
be satisfied with second-place honors
most of the season, gave a tremen
dous heave of 52 feet 8 inches, better
than any Indian has done so far this
season, and topping his seasonal mark
by a full 14 inches. Not to be out
done, Howie Hertz, Hokanson's team
mate-rival, heaved a toss of 52' 10"
to again grab the top spot. Needless
to say, both tosses were far beyond
those of any competitors.
