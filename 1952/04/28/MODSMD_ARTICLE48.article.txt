# Dean's Baseballers Defeat Alumni, Fresno State; Essegian Homers Again
## 
### 
Both extremes of baseball were
played over the weekend in the
Sunken Diamond, a- the Stanford
varsity wjn a pair of games, de
feating Fresno State, 5-3, and edg
ing the Stanford alumni, 9-8.
In the first game, a fast two-hour
affair, tight pitching, smooth field
ing, and alert base running gave
the Indians a victory over one of
the top teams in the West. The loss
broke a 14-game winning streak for
the Fresno team. Only one extra
player, inserted as a pinch runner,
participated in the contest.
Yet in the Saturday tilt, 35 play
ers, including eight pitchers, played
in an error-filled game that includ
ed everything from 10 walks to
Chuck Essegian's seventh and long
est home run.
Joe Chez, who went the distance
in the opener for the Indians, had a
shaky first inning, but then settled
down to pitch creditable baseball.
After the first two men were re
tired, Chez gave up three consecu
tive singles to drive in a run for
the visitors. He quickly bore down,
retiring the next man and striking
out the side in the second frame.
Fourteen men in a row were set
down by Chez before giving up a
base on balls in the sixth.
Smooth base - running netted a
pair of runs in the fifth. Alter Rich
Scramaglia and Warren Goodrich
had both singled, they were bunted
to third by Dick Cole. With only
one out, clean-up hitter Jack Shep
ard fooled the infield by laying
down a perfect squeeze bunt. Scra
maglia easily scored, and Goodrich,
reaching third, saw the ball was
just being fielded, and so continued
on toward the plate for a second
score.
Chez scored the final Stanford tally
on a two-base error by the catcher,
a sacrifice (the fourth in four in

nings by Stanford), and an outfield
fly. Bolger only gave up five hits
to the Indians, but the smooth base
running and some good fielding be
hind Chez broke the visitors' streak.
The alumni game was amusing to
fans, players, umpires, ancl public
address announcer Bob Burnett,
who in the off-season is Stanford's
basketball coach. The high point of
the game was Essegian's 410-foot
wallop. It was hit off Stan Ander
son, captain of the 1935 team, and
one of the string of alumni pitchers
to be usekl.
Phyl led the alumni with his
triple arid another single. Essegian
and Shefpard were outstanding for
the "youngsters." Besides the hom
er, the left fielder had a single and
two other walks. Shepard had two
singles, two bases on balls, two runs
scored, and three stolen bases to his
credit.

Both extremes of baseball were
played over the weekend in the
Sunken Diamond, a- the Stanford
varsity wjn a pair of games, de
feating Fresno State, 5-3, and edg
ing the Stanford alumni, 9-8.
In the first game, a fast two-hour
affair, tight pitching, smooth field
ing, and alert base running gave
the Indians a victory over one of
the top teams in the West. The loss
broke a 14-game winning streak for
the Fresno team. Only one extra
player, inserted as a pinch runner,
participated in the contest.
Yet in the Saturday tilt, 35 play
ers, including eight pitchers, played
in an error-filled game that includ
ed everything from 10 walks to
Chuck Essegian's seventh and long
est home run.
Joe Chez, who went the distance
in the opener for the Indians, had a
shaky first inning, but then settled
down to pitch creditable baseball.
After the first two men were re
tired, Chez gave up three consecu
tive singles to drive in a run for
the visitors. He quickly bore down,
retiring the next man and striking
out the side in the second frame.
Fourteen men in a row were set
down by Chez before giving up a
base on balls in the sixth.
Smooth base - running netted a
pair of runs in the fifth. Alter Rich
Scramaglia and Warren Goodrich
had both singled, they were bunted
to third by Dick Cole. With only
one out, clean-up hitter Jack Shep
ard fooled the infield by laying
down a perfect squeeze bunt. Scra
maglia easily scored, and Goodrich,
reaching third, saw the ball was
just being fielded, and so continued

Both extremes of baseball were
played over the weekend in the
Sunken Diamond, a- the Stanford
varsity wjn a pair of games, de
feating Fresno State, 5-3, and edg
ing the Stanford alumni, 9-8.
In the first game, a fast two-hour
affair, tight pitching, smooth field
ing, and alert base running gave
the Indians a victory over one of
the top teams in the West. The loss
broke a 14-game winning streak for
the Fresno team. Only one extra
player, inserted as a pinch runner,
participated in the contest.
Yet in the Saturday tilt, 35 play
ers, including eight pitchers, played
in an error-filled game that includ
ed everything from 10 walks to
Chuck Essegian's seventh and long
est home run.
Joe Chez, who went the distance
in the opener for the Indians, had a
shaky first inning, but then settled
down to pitch creditable baseball.
After the first two men were re
tired, Chez gave up three consecu
tive singles to drive in a run for
the visitors. He quickly bore down,
retiring the next man and striking
out the side in the second frame.
Fourteen men in a row were set
down by Chez before giving up a
base on balls in the sixth.
Smooth base - running netted a
pair of runs in the fifth. Alter Rich
Scramaglia and Warren Goodrich
had both singled, they were bunted
to third by Dick Cole. With only
one out, clean-up hitter Jack Shep
ard fooled the infield by laying
down a perfect squeeze bunt. Scra
maglia easily scored, and Goodrich,
reaching third, saw the ball was
just being fielded, and so continued
on toward the plate for a second
score.
Chez scored the final Stanford tally
on a two-base error by the catcher,
a sacrifice (the fourth in four in

nings by Stanford), and an outfield
fly. Bolger only gave up five hits
to the Indians, but the smooth base
running and some good fielding be
hind Chez broke the visitors' streak.
The alumni game was amusing to
fans, players, umpires, ancl public
address announcer Bob Burnett,
who in the off-season is Stanford's
basketball coach. The high point of
the game was Essegian's 410-foot
wallop. It was hit off Stan Ander
son, captain of the 1935 team, and
one of the string of alumni pitchers
to be usekl.
Phyl led the alumni with his
triple arid another single. Essegian
and Shefpard were outstanding for
the "youngsters." Besides the hom
er, the left fielder had a single and
two other walks. Shepard had two
singles, two bases on balls, two runs
scored, and three stolen bases to his
credit.
