# Torch Carried To Rossotti's
## 
### 
"Back to the Farm Week" ended
in a blaze of glory as the seniors
triumphantly bore the precious
torch up the long, difficult path to
Rossotti's.
A minor delay occurred along the
way as several ambitious Frosh kid
napped a runner and his torch.
Finally regaining their torch after
a long chase, the seniors finished the
race, arriving ut Rossotti's fifteen
minutes late.
Starting from the Union at three
o'clock, the seniors went around Lake
Lag instead of through it as has been
done traditionally. The robbery oc
curred on the Ros.sotti Road.
ASSU president Wayne Alley, the
final runner in the five-mile race,
lit the Olympic pot to signal the
beginning of the afternoon's games
at Mount Rossotti. Softball games,
races, and a Charleston contest were
hvld during the afternoon.
