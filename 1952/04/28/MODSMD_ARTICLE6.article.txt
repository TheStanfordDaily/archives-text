BATTLE LOST TO MISSOURI—Main buildings of Sherman Air
Force base near Leavenworth, Kan., lie deep in water after the
Missouri River broke through newly raised dikes. More than
1,600 men fought a nine-day battle against the river but lost to
the record crest. Damage to the $3,500,000 base is estimated at
$1,000,000. Almost all equipment was removed from buildings
during the fight to strengthen the dikes. —NEA Telephoto
