# IIR to Choose Student Hosts
## 
### 
Interviews for students interested
in acting as hosts and hostesses for
foreign students next year will be
held in the lIR Shack today from
3:15 to 6.
The job of host or hostess con
sists of introducing foreign students
to other Stanford students, helping
them through registration, and
making them feel at home at Stan
ford.
About two-thirds of the foreign
students next year will be graduate
students. For this reason, the host
program hopes to have a turn-out
of upper division and grad students.
About 150 to 200 new foreign stu
dents are expected for next year.
Bob Jessen is the director of the
host program.
