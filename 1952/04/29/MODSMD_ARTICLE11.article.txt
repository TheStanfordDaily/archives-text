# Ridgway Transferred As Occupation Closes
## Merrymaking Marks Japan Independence 
### 
TOKYO, April 28 (UP) —Japan celebrated the
end of Allied occupation tonight with an explo
sion of merrymaking dimmed by official warn
ings that Communism gravely threatens its new
found independence.
The end of Allied occupation of the defeated

country was sounded by Japan's
ancient temple bells and the wail
ing of modern sirens, but many
Japanese met the occasion soberly.
The Foreign Office issued a white
paper which accused Russia of plot
ting to make Japan a "second Ko
rea'' and endorsed the anti-Com
munist. stand of this nation's West
ern allies.
Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida
warned that Japan's horizon is
"darkened by the menace of Com
munism which seeks to conquer the
world by propaganda and by armed
aggression."
Rearmament Promised
Yoshida promised to lead the
country toward rearmament at the
side of the United States.
Even as Yoshida issued the state
| ment, Japan's Communist party an
nounced it would fight for the abro
! gation of what it called the "traitor
ous treaties" and withdrawal of for
eign troops.
Twenty - nine nations allied in
World War II signed the treaty, but
i Russia and Red China did not. India
ended its state of war in an ex
change of notes. Japan and Na
tionalist China signed a separate
treaty in Taipei, Formosa.
A direct radio broadcast from
Washington signaled formal ratifi
cation of the peace treaty at 10:30
p.m. (6:30 a.m. PDT) which ended
6'/j years of occupation.
Two Flags Raised
The flag of the Rising Sun was
! raised alongside the Stars and
j Stripes over U.S. military bases,
symbolizing the beginning of Ja
pan's alliance with the nation that
forged its defeat and reconstruction.
Sirens which once warned of
mass bombing attacks shrieked the
j start of a new era, and the whistles
of revelers in Tokyo's garish, neon
lighted night club district clashed
with the majestic tones of the old
temple bells.
The celebration was unofficial.
The nation has been jubilant since
the pcace treaty was signed in San
j Francisco last September, but the
| official celebration comes May 3,
which the government already has
proclaimed as official Independence
Day.

TOKYO, April 28 (UP) —Japan celebrated the
end of Allied occupation tonight with an explo
sion of merrymaking dimmed by official warn
ings that Communism gravely threatens its new
found independence.
The end of Allied occupation of the defeated

country was sounded by Japan's
ancient temple bells and the wail
ing of modern sirens, but many
Japanese met the occasion soberly.
The Foreign Office issued a white
paper which accused Russia of plot
ting to make Japan a "second Ko
rea'' and endorsed the anti-Com
munist. stand of this nation's West
ern allies.
Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida
warned that Japan's horizon is
"darkened by the menace of Com
munism which seeks to conquer the
world by propaganda and by armed
aggression."
Rearmament Promised
Yoshida promised to lead the
country toward rearmament at the
side of the United States.
Even as Yoshida issued the state
| ment, Japan's Communist party an
nounced it would fight for the abro
! gation of what it called the "traitor
ous treaties" and withdrawal of for
eign troops.
Twenty - nine nations allied in
World War II signed the treaty, but
i Russia and Red China did not. India
ended its state of war in an ex
change of notes. Japan and Na
tionalist China signed a separate
treaty in Taipei, Formosa.
A direct radio broadcast from
Washington signaled formal ratifi
cation of the peace treaty at 10:30
p.m. (6:30 a.m. PDT) which ended
6'/j years of occupation.
Two Flags Raised
The flag of the Rising Sun was
! raised alongside the Stars and
j Stripes over U.S. military bases,
symbolizing the beginning of Ja
pan's alliance with the nation that
forged its defeat and reconstruction.
Sirens which once warned of
mass bombing attacks shrieked the
j start of a new era, and the whistles
of revelers in Tokyo's garish, neon
lighted night club district clashed
with the majestic tones of the old
temple bells.
