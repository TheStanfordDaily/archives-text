# DeVoto Cites Democratic Chances
## 
### SUE GOODSTEIN Daily Managing Editor 
With Gov. Adlai Stevenson
out of the presidential race, the
strongest hope for the Democra
tic party is for Taft to get the
nomination, Bernard DeVoto told
:
The Daily in an interview yes
terday.
Except for Stevenson, the Dcmo-
I crats don't have any candidate who
could win the election against the
i Republicans, DeVoto observed, un
less that candidate were Taft. And
if Taft gets the nomination, Harper's
columnist commented, "any Demo
crat would have an easy chance."
For the three candidates out to
got the Democratic nomination,
DeVoto had this to say: "Harri
man's candidacy wouldn't go very
far since he didn't have the politi
cal background to win political
| professionals outside of New York.
Although there is no question of
his making an excellent president,"
DeVoto pointed out. Harriman was
politically unknown outside of his
| own state.
Kefauver doesn't have the support
[ of the professional politicians of the
| party or the northern labor groups,
; and Kerr, representing a Democrat
j of conservative leanings acceptable
to the South, might be the party's
j choice if Stevenson could not be
| drafted.
DeVoto, who expressed in a re
cent Harper's article his belief that
Stevenson was the answer to the
independent voter's (jucst. said the
Illinois governor might not he en
tirely out of the running. If the
chaos in the Democratic party pre
vails until the convention, Steven
son might be drafted at the con

vention. "But this is merely a
guess," he added.
Eisenhower's chances for winning
lie nomination and the election
:eemcd very good in DeVoto's

opinion. He felt that the independent
would cast their voles for the Gen
eral, if Stevenson wasn't a candidate.
Harper's columnist and literary
critic tore into Bob Taft's candidacy

with the following description—
"the Senators' voting record is
grotesquely had; he is opposed to
everything that has been effective
in preparation for defense pnd
peace; and his support of Mc-
Carthy and the encouragement of
his techniques make it impossible
to think of him as ethical candi
date."
DeVoto was confident that the
average American voter realized the
danger in Taft's foreign policy, and
that this would be a more important,
election issue than Administrative
corruption, should he be nominated.
In his Harper's column (April, '52),
DeVoto pointed out that even if
Eisenhower were president, his
sound foreign policy would be sub
ject to a "wrecking crew" brought
into important offices by a Republi
can victory.
Taft would ho the most powerful
figure in the Republican Congress;
Senator Wiley wuld he senior Re
publican on Foreign Relations, and
Chiperfield of Illinois senior Re
publican on House Committee
on Foreign Affairs. Martin. Velde,
and Aandahl would have strong
hrl 's in the House, with Hickcn
loopcr, Hricker, Keni, Malonc, and
Jenner in the Senate.
But in yesterday's interview, De-
Voto voiced a more optimistic note
for Republican prospects. He said
that if Eisenhower were elected pres
ident he could possibly solidify his
own bloc support and Taft might
find his hands bound in foreign policy
making by the facts.
DeVoto, who claimed he was not
a political expert but had read the
Congressional Record, summed up
his political observations by saying
that "no matter who was elected
president the U.S. was in too good
a position to 'go to the dogs'."
