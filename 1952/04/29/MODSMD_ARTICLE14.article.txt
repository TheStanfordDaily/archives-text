# Truman Tells Red Dangers To New Japan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. April 28 (UP) —
Japan again became an independent i
nation today and President Truman j
immediately cautioned the free i
world's newest ally to beware of [
the dangers of Russian imperialism, j
Simultaneously, Russia accused
the United States of "converting"
Japan into a "military bridgehead"
in preparation of "a new war in
the Far East." Japan in turn ac
cused the Soviet Union of plotting
to make the island nation a "second
Korea."
Japan, which plunged the United |
States in World War II with its
treacherous attack on Pearl Harbor,
became a sovereign power again at
6:30 a.m. PST. It had undergone
nearly seven years of occupation by j
the victorious Allies who blasted its ,
seapower and drove its troops from j
scores of Pacific isles.
Secretary of State Dean Acheson j
restored Japanese independence
when he deposited the U.S. ratifi- |
cation of the Japanese peace treaty
in the national archives. This for- I
mality brought the treaty, to which i
Russia is not a party, into full el- I
feet.
1 lie peace treaty—a pact of "re- i
conciliation"—is liberal. It permits j
Japan to build whatover land, sea,
and air forces it wants. It will be
limited only by the anti-war pro
visions of its own new constitution.
Alexander M. Panyushkin, Rus- i
sian ambassador to the United l
States and Soviet, representative on
the Far Eastern Commission, de
nounced Hie pacts "as the treaties
for preparation of a new war in the
Far East."
