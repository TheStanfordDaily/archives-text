# Robeson, Art, and the Opera House
## 
### 
San Francisco, noted around the world for its
cosmopolitanism, tolerance, and liberal spirit,
received a blot on its record yesterday when
the Trustees of the War Memorial Opera House
refused permission to Paul Robeson to sing
there May 22.
In so doing, they handed Communists one
of the best propaganda points they could hope
for. Communist groups and sympathizers can
make capital out of racial discrimination, poli
tical discrimination, or both, whether they are
valid or not.
The Opera House Board, it seems to us, is
guilty of confusing art and politics, a dangerous
confusion. Robeson was to sing and to sing
only, and his stature as an artist, a baritone of
considerable critical repute, should be the pri
mary consideration, not his political beliefs.
Robeson's sponsors ring very solidly with
left-wing connotations. And Robeson, by seek
ing sponsorship from such groups, is himself
guilty of confusing art with politics, or using
art for political profit. This we find hard to ap
prove. At the same time, we do not feel that
refusing Robeson a concert in the Opera House
aids the anti-Communist cause, but rather that
it thwarts it by playing directly into the Com
munist propagandist's hands.

The action of the board is not the way to fight
Communism. Fight Communism, we say. But
understand it and fight it, else it is an irrational,
emotional, hysterical battle; not idea against
idea or truth against falsity, but hysteria against
hysteria.
The Robeson banning cannot make for toler
ance or understanding. It can only engender
more ill will, a resort to more devious propa
ganda, and deprivation of local music lovers
of the right to hear what music critics adjudge
a fine baritone.
That the Opera House Board has the right
as governors of a semi-private institution to de
cide who may or may not use the Opera House
facilities, no one is disputing. We are question
ing their values and their judgment.
If their decision was made to mollify public
opinion and avoid a controversy, their success
is a moot point. Feelings on either side are
equally heated. If their decision was based on
Robeson's political beliefs—and we think the
decision was both of these—we say they are
making a mistake. Either way or both, what
they may look upon as a service to San Fran
cisco might instead be a serious disservice.

The Robeson banning cannot make for toler
ance or understanding. It can only engender
more ill will, a resort to more devious propa
ganda, and deprivation of local music lovers
of the right to hear what music critics adjudge
a fine baritone.
That the Opera House Board has the right
as governors of a semi-private institution to de
cide who may or may not use the Opera House
facilities, no one is disputing. We are question
ing their values and their judgment.
If their decision was made to mollify public
opinion and avoid a controversy, their success
is a moot point. Feelings on either side are
equally heated. If their decision was based on
Robeson's political beliefs—and we think the
decision was both of these—we say they are
making a mistake. Either way or both, what
they may look upon as a service to San Fran
cisco might instead be a serious disservice.

San Francisco, noted around the world for its
cosmopolitanism, tolerance, and liberal spirit,
received a blot on its record yesterday when
the Trustees of the War Memorial Opera House
refused permission to Paul Robeson to sing
there May 22.
In so doing, they handed Communists one
of the best propaganda points they could hope
for. Communist groups and sympathizers can
make capital out of racial discrimination, poli
tical discrimination, or both, whether they are
valid or not.
The Opera House Board, it seems to us, is
guilty of confusing art and politics, a dangerous
confusion. Robeson was to sing and to sing
only, and his stature as an artist, a baritone of
considerable critical repute, should be the pri
mary consideration, not his political beliefs.
Robeson's sponsors ring very solidly with
left-wing connotations. And Robeson, by seek
ing sponsorship from such groups, is himself
guilty of confusing art with politics, or using
art for political profit. This we find hard to ap
prove. At the same time, we do not feel that
refusing Robeson a concert in the Opera House
aids the anti-Communist cause, but rather that
it thwarts it by playing directly into the Com
munist propagandist's hands.

The action of the board is not the way to fight
Communism. Fight Communism, we say. But
understand it and fight it, else it is an irrational,
emotional, hysterical battle; not idea against
idea or truth against falsity, but hysteria against
hysteria.
