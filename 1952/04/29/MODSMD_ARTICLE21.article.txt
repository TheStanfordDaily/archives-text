### PETE GROTHE 
Meet llie Chezes
Two weeks ago, Joe Chez, the square-jawed control
artist from Medford, Oregon, was pitching a one
hitter against the league-leading USC team. When
Joe came to bat in the sixth inning, he received a
nice round of applause. When the applause died down,
there was still one fan standing and shouting, "Atta
baby, Joe. Great pitching. C'mon, Joe, let's get a
hit! Hum, babe, Joe!"
Joe's enthusiastic admirer was Fred Chez, his
brother.
This one's about the Chez brothers, then. And if
there are any two brothers who are closer to each
other than the Chezes, I'd like to see them. As one
guy in the Theta Chi house put it,"It takes those
guys 10 minutes to say goodbye to each other."
Relations weren't always smooth between the bro
thers Chez (rhymes with says). In fact, when Joe was
four, he was somewhat irritated at his brother (age
five). It all happened when the two Were playing
doctor with the girl next door (age four). The little
girl had a nurse's kit, and after the three had been
doctoring each other for several minutes, Fred said,
"I know what, I'll take out your tonsils, Joe."
Joe, age four, had never heard of tonsils, and
probably couldn't have pronounced them if he had
heard of them, so he said, "Okay, ha, ha. take them
out."
With which Fred grabbed a near-by bed sprine,
dipped it down Joe's throat, and with a sudden jerk
lipped out the tonsils. Joe chased Fred around the
block four times before he caught him. The family
doctor later remarked, "I couldn't have done a better
job, myself."
Joe reversed the tables a year later when he
grabbed an electric sprayer with some green paint
in it and gave Fred a going over. Thereby making
Fred the original boy with the green hair.
Fred was an all-around athlete in high school,

and was firs! string center on the Stanford freshman
football team, lie had to give it up, though, when he
sprained both ankles badly. However, as a base
ball player, Fred was a total flop.
His baseball career consisted of pitching to one man
in high school, whom, incidentally, he got out. Out
cold. Fred beaned the guy who, just to give this
story a Bill Stern twist, was brother Joe.
Joe is highly sought by Major League scouts, and
his record explains why. Over the four year span,
he has won 29 and lost three. Coach Everett Dean
has this to say about Joe, "He is a tremendous work
er and one of the best liked players on the squad.
Not only that, but he's also the team's practical joker."
As far as being a cut-up, Joe excels. While hash
ing at Lngunita a few years ago, he captured a herd
of jumping frogs from Lake Lag and stuck them in
the salad. To make the meal complete, Joe sneaked
some long cotton fibers in the mashed potatoes.
A visitor who walked in the dining hall remarked,
"Those girls look like a bunch of dogs chewing
caramel candy."
Shortly after, the powers that be at Lag transferred
Joe to the Encina dishroom.
Fred, who hashed at Union and who wasn't to be
outdone, walked into a Union candlelight dinner in
a miner's cap.
Neither of the Chezes smoke or drink. When every
one else in the Theta Chi house goes out for beer,
Fred and Joe go out for "Goodies." "Goodies" being
extra big ice cream cones served in Palo Alto.
A final anecdote. When Joe pitched his one-hit
shutout against the Trojans two weeks ago, it marked
the first time in four years and in over 150 games
that USC had been blanked. The disheartened Tro
jans never wanted to hear the name "Chez" again.
So where were they taken for dinner . . . Chez
Yvonne. One ball player groaned, "Chez, Chez . . .
even at dinner his name haunts us."

Two weeks ago, Joe Chez, the square-jawed control
artist from Medford, Oregon, was pitching a one
hitter against the league-leading USC team. When
Joe came to bat in the sixth inning, he received a
nice round of applause. When the applause died down,
there was still one fan standing and shouting, "Atta
baby, Joe. Great pitching. C'mon, Joe, let's get a
hit! Hum, babe, Joe!"
Joe's enthusiastic admirer was Fred Chez, his
brother.
This one's about the Chez brothers, then. And if
there are any two brothers who are closer to each
other than the Chezes, I'd like to see them. As one
guy in the Theta Chi house put it,"It takes those
guys 10 minutes to say goodbye to each other."
Relations weren't always smooth between the bro
thers Chez (rhymes with says). In fact, when Joe was
four, he was somewhat irritated at his brother (age
five). It all happened when the two Were playing
doctor with the girl next door (age four). The little
girl had a nurse's kit, and after the three had been
doctoring each other for several minutes, Fred said,
"I know what, I'll take out your tonsils, Joe."
Joe, age four, had never heard of tonsils, and
probably couldn't have pronounced them if he had
heard of them, so he said, "Okay, ha, ha. take them
out."
With which Fred grabbed a near-by bed sprine,
dipped it down Joe's throat, and with a sudden jerk
lipped out the tonsils. Joe chased Fred around the
block four times before he caught him. The family
doctor later remarked, "I couldn't have done a better
job, myself."
Joe reversed the tables a year later when he
grabbed an electric sprayer with some green paint
in it and gave Fred a going over. Thereby making
Fred the original boy with the green hair.
Fred was an all-around athlete in high school,

and was firs! string center on the Stanford freshman
football team, lie had to give it up, though, when he
sprained both ankles badly. However, as a base
ball player, Fred was a total flop.
His baseball career consisted of pitching to one man
in high school, whom, incidentally, he got out. Out
cold. Fred beaned the guy who, just to give this
story a Bill Stern twist, was brother Joe.
Joe is highly sought by Major League scouts, and
his record explains why. Over the four year span,
he has won 29 and lost three. Coach Everett Dean
has this to say about Joe, "He is a tremendous work
er and one of the best liked players on the squad.
Not only that, but he's also the team's practical joker."
As far as being a cut-up, Joe excels. While hash
ing at Lngunita a few years ago, he captured a herd
of jumping frogs from Lake Lag and stuck them in
the salad. To make the meal complete, Joe sneaked
some long cotton fibers in the mashed potatoes.
A visitor who walked in the dining hall remarked,
"Those girls look like a bunch of dogs chewing
caramel candy."
Shortly after, the powers that be at Lag transferred
Joe to the Encina dishroom.
Fred, who hashed at Union and who wasn't to be
outdone, walked into a Union candlelight dinner in
a miner's cap.
Neither of the Chezes smoke or drink. When every
one else in the Theta Chi house goes out for beer,
Fred and Joe go out for "Goodies." "Goodies" being
extra big ice cream cones served in Palo Alto.
A final anecdote. When Joe pitched his one-hit
shutout against the Trojans two weeks ago, it marked
the first time in four years and in over 150 games
that USC had been blanked. The disheartened Tro
jans never wanted to hear the name "Chez" again.
So where were they taken for dinner . . . Chez
Yvonne. One ball player groaned, "Chez, Chez . . .
even at dinner his name haunts us."
