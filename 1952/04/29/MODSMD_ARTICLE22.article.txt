# CAMPUS OPINION
## On the Blood Drive: An Orchid and a Request 
### 
To the Editor:
The Student Health Committee would like to ex
tend a special note of gratitude to the A Phi O Service
Fraternity for their wholesale co-operation in the
campus-wide distribution of parental release forms
and their 40 hour role of staffing appointment booths
in the recent Red Cross Blood Drive. We are also
grateful to the Army, Navy, and Air Force reserve
units for their support in their class sessions, and to
Harvey Segall of the Public Relations Committee for
his helpful suggestions in the publicity campaign.
—STUDENT HEALTH COMMITTEE
P.S. In reference to Mr. J.B.'s letter to the editor
in yesterday's Daily, I do not consider the Red Cross
Blood Drive a "flop." Idealistically and patriotically,
Mr. J.B. is right, but Mr. J.B. neglects to consider the
realistic limitations and for that matter, a few vital
statistics pertinent to the drive. To compare this drive

with those in Japan whether Allied, military, or civi
lian is not a true analogy. On the surface, it would
seem that Stanford should contribute at least 6,000
pints, but before one considers this figure too hope
fully and before losing one's analytical acumen con
cerning the "disgraceful'' 450 pints, I would suggest
that the Student Health Committee be consulted first
for a few facts on the issue.
I don't know who Mr. J.B. is (no one will ambush
you if you give your full name), but I do sincerely
wish that he would phone me at DA 3-8776 so we can
talk the matter over. If the blood drive can be im
proved, and greater response obtained. I am open for
all suggestions, for another drive will be repeated
next fall. Mr. J.B. has the right idea (the last two
paragraphs in his letter are well written), but his
picture is somewhat out of perspective.
