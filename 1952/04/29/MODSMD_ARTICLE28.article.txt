# Draft Deferments Explained
## 
### 
There are two basic deferment
classifications which may be
granted to men applying for de
ferment, I-S and 11-S.
To begin with, take the case
of an 18-year-old who has never
before applied for deferment;
assume he has not yet taken the
Selective Service Qualification
test and that he needs to apply
for deferment to escape induc
tion before the end of an aca
demic year:
It is a statutory law and compul
sory for a local board to defer him

in the class
known vari
ously as I-S
and I-SC until
the end of an
academic year
providing that
three condi
tions are ful- ,
filled. \
1 — He has
never had a
deferment of
any kind be
fore.
2 — He ap
plies for de
ferment to his
local board.
3 — He has
the University
ceritfy his sta
tus as a stu
dent.
At the end '
of the aca-

demic year, all deferment cases will
be reopened for reclassification and
all students desiring further defer
ment must again apply.

Obviously, only one I-S defer
ment may be granted, so to obtain
deferment again the student must
qualify for a lI—S classification. This
is an occupational deferment for
students, also known as a 11-AS
and sometimes as a straight 11-A.
Second Deferment
At the present time, to be eli
gible for consideration for a 11-S
classification for the academic year
1952-53 a student must have the
following qualifications:
Freshmen: Rank in the upper
half of their class and/or a score of
70 or higher on the Selective Serv
ice Qualification test.
'Sophomores: Rank in the upper
two - thirds of their class and/or
a score of 70 or higher on the SSQ
test.
Juniors: Upper three-fourths of
cla.'s and/or 70 or higher on the
SSQ test.
Seniors planning on graduate
work: Upper half of class and/or
a score of 75 or higher on the SSQ
test.
Graduate students: Be satisfac
torily pursuing a full-time course
of instruction.
These qualifications will be used
by the board in considering appli
cations for deferment. They are not
criteria for automatic deferment.
Apply for Deferment
In addition, the student should
apply for deferment with his local
board, retaining a copy of all cor
respondence for his own records.
The board must also receive a
109 Form from the University cer
tifying his standing in class, based
on the current academic year's
grades.
The latter will be sent automati
cally if the student fills out and
returns the draft questionnaire
which the Chief Counselor for

Men's office will send to all draft
eligible students within two weeks.
11-S deferments may not be
granted for a period of longer than
one year, and some are only for
six months.
When the student again comes up
for reclassification, he must reapply
for deferment and have the Chief
Counselor for Men's office send a
109 Form certifying his current stu
dent status.
Draft Appeals
If a man possesses the foregoing
qualifications and is not granted a
deferment classification by his local
board, he may appeal his case.
Such appeals must be made in
writing to the local board and be
filed with the board within 10 days
from the day his classification no
tice was mailed him. The appeal
automatically places his case in the
hands of the State Appeal Board
for a decision .
(Tomorrow: ROTC programs and
deferments obtainable through
them.)

Counselor for Men, has released
