### DICK KLEIN Frosh In—Rule Out 
The Athletic Department has gotten a re-interpretation of the NCAA
policy concerning the eligibility of freshmen. The new .slant is that frosh
will continue to be eligible for the entire season, which takes in all the
national collegiate competition sponsored by the NCAA that comes off at
the conclusion of Spring Sports.
What the NCAA said about the future was something completely dif
ferent however. 'J he top body notified members that frosh would not be

eligible from this season on. For those who com
pleted this season, the three-year limitation rule for
NCAA competition would be waived to give the '55ers
a chance to play Varsity sports all the way through
their senior year.
Naturally, this appears to be a much fairer ap
proach to the whole situation. Therefore, the NCAA,
by clarifying their position, has no intention of giving
anybody a raw deal.
SC ANI) TRACK—AN UNHEALTHY PAIR?
Looking over some PCC statistics for track, the
Sporting Line is a little annoyed with the complete
domination of USC Trojan athletes. Of the 15 regular
dual events, a Trojan owns the top mark for the

tntire Coast in ten events. Only in the sprints, half-mile, and javelin are
the'SC names so glaringly missing.
Let's take a quick flip through. Parry O'Brien, with a toss of 55' 2",
and Sim Iness, 182' 5", completely overshadow the rest of the field in the
shot put and discus. Distance ace Art Garcia has times of 4:15.7 and
9:22.5 for the mile and two-mile. National champ Jack Davis, just barely
rounding into form, has traversed the high hurdles in :14.3 and the low
sticks in :23.7.
John Bradley sports the best sing'e lap time of :48.G. A 1 Sandusky has
vaulted 13'9", and Frank Flores has broad jumped 24'G 3 /i". A trio of SC
high jumpers are tabbed one-two-three. It's Dick Brombach, G'G"; Manuel
lionquillo, G's%"; and Jerry Kincheloe, G' 4%".
A Thundering Herd relay team owned '.he best baton-passing mark of
n: 17.(5 until the Cal foursome the mile in 3:17 flat over this last
weekend. Add in some strong seconds and thirds by men like Bob Van
Doren, Des Koch, Verle Sorgen, Frank Johnson, and Norm Stocks, and you
t.ee the real power of the Trojan track machine.
The statistics show that no Northern Division thinclad is tops in any
event. The rest of the best marks go to Stanford's John Woolley in the
880 (1:53.4), to Rod Richard of UCLA in the sprints (:09.7 and:20.8), and
to Bear Sam Adams in the javelin with a toss of 212' 6%."
We don't like to cry or seem like poor losers, but those statistics give
some kind of indication of what the University of Southern California is
doing to the track picture. Athletics are based on keen competitive spirit
and good sportsmanship. But what does SC know about those two aspects
of « ports?
It's no fun to compete when you never have a chance to win. And that's
the attitude that is developing toward the Trojan track hordes. A coach
can set 50 points as his scoring goal when his good team meets the Southern
Cal boys. A condition like that, especially lasting over a long period of
time, takes away all the spirit of competition.
And SC shows little regard for good sportsmanship when they expect
the other conference teams to abide by all the eligibility rules and game
regulations, only to violate the most basic rule of all—and that's having
a minimum admission requirement..
It's useless and senseless to go through a long list of names and cite
athletes who have competed for USC and who could never have met the
admissions requirements of the other PCC schools. It wouldn't be fair
to the boys in question, for they might have done their bit in building up
the SC track tradition in good faith.
The important fact is that SC has all sorts of gimmicks to get the
"cream of the crop" in. One catch-all beauty is a special exam for all
applicants who fail to have the required recommending units. Pass it and
you're in, and once enrolled, there is little chance of rolling out of SC.
There are always savers like '"Music Appreciation" make-ups and a fine
PE major to fall back on, and then, too, a competitor need only attend Troy
while his particular sport is going on.
'! he PCC has been trying, and plenty hard, to meet the problem. Latest
regulation enacted was the rule of "academic progress," passed in Decem
ber, *1951. It states that in order to be eligible an athlete must have com
pleted 24 semester hours (or 3G quarter hours) between seasons. This does
away with competitors enrolled only during their sport.
But there is more work to be done to put the Trojans somewhere near
the admission standards of the other colleges in the Pacific Coast Con
ference. It has to be done soon or else the track picture will get blacker
and blacker.
On the Farm we should really be proud of our team and our coach
who is doing his utmost in bringing around his athletes to top form. Many
rate the Cards as the fifth best dual track team in the nation. But the
Trojans come along and bop them, 90Va to 40V 2 .
USC is the only team in the country that could keep Bob Mathias from
any first places. They are also the only team that could conceivably keep
Stanford from any firsts at all. Let's hope some action can be taken to
give Coach Jack and his thinclads a chance sometime in the future.

"cream of the crop" in. One catch-all beauty is a special exam for all
applicants who fail to have the required recommending units. Pass it and
you're in, and once enrolled, there is little chance of rolling out of SC.
There are always savers like '"Music Appreciation" make-ups and a fine
PE major to fall back on, and then, too, a competitor need only attend Troy
while his particular sport is going on.
'! he PCC has been trying, and plenty hard, to meet the problem. Latest
regulation enacted was the rule of "academic progress," passed in Decem
ber, *1951. It states that in order to be eligible an athlete must have com
pleted 24 semester hours (or 3G quarter hours) between seasons. This does
away with competitors enrolled only during their sport.
But there is more work to be done to put the Trojans somewhere near
the admission standards of the other colleges in the Pacific Coast Con
ference. It has to be done soon or else the track picture will get blacker
and blacker.
On the Farm we should really be proud of our team and our coach
who is doing his utmost in bringing around his athletes to top form. Many
rate the Cards as the fifth best dual track team in the nation. But the
Trojans come along and bop them, 90Va to 40V 2 .
USC is the only team in the country that could keep Bob Mathias from
any first places. They are also the only team that could conceivably keep
Stanford from any firsts at all. Let's hope some action can be taken to

The Athletic Department has gotten a re-interpretation of the NCAA
policy concerning the eligibility of freshmen. The new .slant is that frosh
will continue to be eligible for the entire season, which takes in all the
national collegiate competition sponsored by the NCAA that comes off at
the conclusion of Spring Sports.
What the NCAA said about the future was something completely dif
ferent however. 'J he top body notified members that frosh would not be

eligible from this season on. For those who com
pleted this season, the three-year limitation rule for
NCAA competition would be waived to give the '55ers
a chance to play Varsity sports all the way through
their senior year.
Naturally, this appears to be a much fairer ap
proach to the whole situation. Therefore, the NCAA,
by clarifying their position, has no intention of giving
anybody a raw deal.
SC ANI) TRACK—AN UNHEALTHY PAIR?
Looking over some PCC statistics for track, the
Sporting Line is a little annoyed with the complete
domination of USC Trojan athletes. Of the 15 regular
dual events, a Trojan owns the top mark for the

tntire Coast in ten events. Only in the sprints, half-mile, and javelin are
the'SC names so glaringly missing.
Let's take a quick flip through. Parry O'Brien, with a toss of 55' 2",
and Sim Iness, 182' 5", completely overshadow the rest of the field in the
shot put and discus. Distance ace Art Garcia has times of 4:15.7 and
9:22.5 for the mile and two-mile. National champ Jack Davis, just barely
rounding into form, has traversed the high hurdles in :14.3 and the low
sticks in :23.7.
John Bradley sports the best sing'e lap time of :48.G. A 1 Sandusky has
vaulted 13'9", and Frank Flores has broad jumped 24'G 3 /i". A trio of SC
high jumpers are tabbed one-two-three. It's Dick Brombach, G'G"; Manuel
lionquillo, G's%"; and Jerry Kincheloe, G' 4%".
A Thundering Herd relay team owned '.he best baton-passing mark of
n: 17.(5 until the Cal foursome the mile in 3:17 flat over this last
weekend. Add in some strong seconds and thirds by men like Bob Van
Doren, Des Koch, Verle Sorgen, Frank Johnson, and Norm Stocks, and you
t.ee the real power of the Trojan track machine.
The statistics show that no Northern Division thinclad is tops in any
event. The rest of the best marks go to Stanford's John Woolley in the
880 (1:53.4), to Rod Richard of UCLA in the sprints (:09.7 and:20.8), and
to Bear Sam Adams in the javelin with a toss of 212' 6%."
We don't like to cry or seem like poor losers, but those statistics give
some kind of indication of what the University of Southern California is
doing to the track picture. Athletics are based on keen competitive spirit
and good sportsmanship. But what does SC know about those two aspects
of « ports?
It's no fun to compete when you never have a chance to win. And that's
the attitude that is developing toward the Trojan track hordes. A coach
can set 50 points as his scoring goal when his good team meets the Southern
Cal boys. A condition like that, especially lasting over a long period of
time, takes away all the spirit of competition.
And SC shows little regard for good sportsmanship when they expect
the other conference teams to abide by all the eligibility rules and game
regulations, only to violate the most basic rule of all—and that's having
a minimum admission requirement..
It's useless and senseless to go through a long list of names and cite
athletes who have competed for USC and who could never have met the
admissions requirements of the other PCC schools. It wouldn't be fair
to the boys in question, for they might have done their bit in building up
the SC track tradition in good faith.

The statistics show that no Northern Division thinclad is tops in any
event. The rest of the best marks go to Stanford's John Woolley in the
880 (1:53.4), to Rod Richard of UCLA in the sprints (:09.7 and:20.8), and
to Bear Sam Adams in the javelin with a toss of 212' 6%."
We don't like to cry or seem like poor losers, but those statistics give
some kind of indication of what the University of Southern California is
doing to the track picture. Athletics are based on keen competitive spirit
and good sportsmanship. But what does SC know about those two aspects
of « ports?
It's no fun to compete when you never have a chance to win. And that's
the attitude that is developing toward the Trojan track hordes. A coach
can set 50 points as his scoring goal when his good team meets the Southern
Cal boys. A condition like that, especially lasting over a long period of
time, takes away all the spirit of competition.
And SC shows little regard for good sportsmanship when they expect
the other conference teams to abide by all the eligibility rules and game
regulations, only to violate the most basic rule of all—and that's having
a minimum admission requirement..
It's useless and senseless to go through a long list of names and cite
athletes who have competed for USC and who could never have met the
admissions requirements of the other PCC schools. It wouldn't be fair
to the boys in question, for they might have done their bit in building up
the SC track tradition in good faith.
The important fact is that SC has all sorts of gimmicks to get the
"cream of the crop" in. One catch-all beauty is a special exam for all
applicants who fail to have the required recommending units. Pass it and
you're in, and once enrolled, there is little chance of rolling out of SC.
There are always savers like '"Music Appreciation" make-ups and a fine
PE major to fall back on, and then, too, a competitor need only attend Troy
while his particular sport is going on.
'! he PCC has been trying, and plenty hard, to meet the problem. Latest
regulation enacted was the rule of "academic progress," passed in Decem
ber, *1951. It states that in order to be eligible an athlete must have com
pleted 24 semester hours (or 3G quarter hours) between seasons. This does
away with competitors enrolled only during their sport.
But there is more work to be done to put the Trojans somewhere near
the admission standards of the other colleges in the Pacific Coast Con
ference. It has to be done soon or else the track picture will get blacker
and blacker.
On the Farm we should really be proud of our team and our coach
who is doing his utmost in bringing around his athletes to top form. Many
rate the Cards as the fifth best dual track team in the nation. But the
Trojans come along and bop them, 90Va to 40V 2 .
USC is the only team in the country that could keep Bob Mathias from
any first places. They are also the only team that could conceivably keep
Stanford from any firsts at all. Let's hope some action can be taken to
give Coach Jack and his thinclads a chance sometime in the future.

The Athletic Department has gotten a re-interpretation of the NCAA
policy concerning the eligibility of freshmen. The new .slant is that frosh
will continue to be eligible for the entire season, which takes in all the
national collegiate competition sponsored by the NCAA that comes off at
the conclusion of Spring Sports.
What the NCAA said about the future was something completely dif
ferent however. 'J he top body notified members that frosh would not be

eligible from this season on. For those who com
pleted this season, the three-year limitation rule for
NCAA competition would be waived to give the '55ers
a chance to play Varsity sports all the way through
their senior year.
Naturally, this appears to be a much fairer ap
proach to the whole situation. Therefore, the NCAA,
by clarifying their position, has no intention of giving
anybody a raw deal.
SC ANI) TRACK—AN UNHEALTHY PAIR?
Looking over some PCC statistics for track, the
Sporting Line is a little annoyed with the complete
domination of USC Trojan athletes. Of the 15 regular
dual events, a Trojan owns the top mark for the

tntire Coast in ten events. Only in the sprints, half-mile, and javelin are
the'SC names so glaringly missing.
Let's take a quick flip through. Parry O'Brien, with a toss of 55' 2",
and Sim Iness, 182' 5", completely overshadow the rest of the field in the
shot put and discus. Distance ace Art Garcia has times of 4:15.7 and
9:22.5 for the mile and two-mile. National champ Jack Davis, just barely
rounding into form, has traversed the high hurdles in :14.3 and the low
sticks in :23.7.
John Bradley sports the best sing'e lap time of :48.G. A 1 Sandusky has
vaulted 13'9", and Frank Flores has broad jumped 24'G 3 /i". A trio of SC
high jumpers are tabbed one-two-three. It's Dick Brombach, G'G"; Manuel
lionquillo, G's%"; and Jerry Kincheloe, G' 4%".
A Thundering Herd relay team owned '.he best baton-passing mark of
n: 17.(5 until the Cal foursome the mile in 3:17 flat over this last
weekend. Add in some strong seconds and thirds by men like Bob Van
Doren, Des Koch, Verle Sorgen, Frank Johnson, and Norm Stocks, and you
