SOPH SWATTER—Grant Spaeth fired a one-under par 70 last
Saturday as Stanford's golfers edged San Jose State 14 to 13.
Spaeth hits a tremendously long ball, but often has trouble
around the greens. Last Saturday's 70 may mean that the tall
soph is ready to shoot good golf in the forthcoming PCC and
NCAA matches. —Daily photo by Jack Byrne
