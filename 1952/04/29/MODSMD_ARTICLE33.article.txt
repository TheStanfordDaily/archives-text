# Kappa Sigs Down Bulls, Clayton Sparks 3-2 Win
## 
### KENT HALLAWELL 
Kappa Sigma's Sterling Clayton
outpitched El Toro's Jim McWil
liams in a tight five-inning duel to
help his teammates to a 3-2 victory
yesterday. The slim speedballer al
lowed but three scattered hits,
struck out six, walked four, and
had the Toro batters popping up
most of the time.
McWilliams hurled a neat five
hitter, walking two, and fanning
none. However, he was nicked for
three tallies in the first two in
nings, enough to spell defeat.
After the Bulls had started off
with a single score in the top of
the first frame. Kappa Sig's Harry
Herring blasted a homer over the
center fielder's head to knot the
count. The remaining two runs came
across in the second on singles by
Clayton, Bill McKay, and Reno
Ryan.
El Toro rallied to close the gap
with a run in the top of the fourth,
and had the tying score on third

base in the fifth when the final out
was recorded. With two down, Pete
Frusetta drew a base on balls, stole
second and third, and was stranded
there as Tom Glickbarg, after
knocking a long foul ball, was
fanned by Clayton.
Both teams played good ball
afield, the Kappa Sigs' one error in
the first inning being the only one
of the game. Larry ("Ugh!") Cahn,
famed Daily sports scribe, made
several fine stops, but did rather
poorly at the plate.
