# Kelly Movie Called 'Cheerful, Diverting'
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
The trouble with hitting the top is that the only road left open
leads down. This is Gene Kelly's problem as he returns to the
screen after An American in Paris with a big now musical
called "Singin' in the Rain," now at the Park.
Kelly meets the problem with charm and verve, and the result,
while no "American," comes closei ♦

to achieving the distinction of its i
predecessor, winner of eight Acad
emy Awards, than any other mu- j
sical within recent memory.
Held together by more than a
dozen good song-and-dance num
bers, the story tells ef Hollywood
during the 1 !>li<)'s and of the situ- j
ations arising in the sudden switch j
from silents to talkies. The |
screen play, by I» i o a d way's !
Adolph Green and Betty Com
den ("Two on the Aisle"), fives a
lot of well - aimed darts at the
movieland bubble, and the effect,
when not ticklinftly satirical, is
consistently cheerful and divert
ing.
Follow-up to "American's" long
ballot sequence is a 13-minute opus, j
"Broadway Melody," which, despite

some very sexy
dancing by Cyd
Charisse, is not
particularly out
standing. It is
rather in a num
ber like the
disarming title
song itself,
danced by Kelly

in a rainy deluge, that the picture
comes into its own.
Again, in a montags spoofing the
various styles of burlesque, vaude
ville, an-1 Ziegfeld, the film tri
umphs. Notable too are the delight

very nearly steals (he show.
All in all, "Singin' in the Rain,"
happily designed to complement the
current ra;;e for reviving the Gold
en Twenties, should please just
about everyone.

fill "Good MorninV' "Fit as a Fid
dle,' "All I Do Is Dream of You,"
"Moms Supposes," and "Make 'em
Laugh."
Apart from Kelly, a trio of good
performances round things out
nicely. Latest of MGIW's hopes for
replacing Judy Garland, Debby
Reynolds — by 110 stretch of the
imagination another Garland — is
fresh ansl pert without being sac
charine. Donald O'Connor, re
patriated after long exile among
talking animals, is given a chance
to display his broad range of tal
ents. Ami Jean Ilagen, uproari
