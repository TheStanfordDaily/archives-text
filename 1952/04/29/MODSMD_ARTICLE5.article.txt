# Author Talks on Perils Of Academic Historian
## 
### 
Bernard DeVoto told 200 people crowded into the library's
Bender Room yesterday that the fear of the academic historian
that he doesn't know enough about his subject is one of the big
gest obstacles holding back good historical writing today.
"History will take its proper place again only when the literary

man starts to write it. The
must stop studying at some point
and start writing about what he
knows," the quick speaking author
said.
DeVoto said Francis Parkman,
author of "The Oregon Trail,"
typified the first great era of Ameri
can historical writing.
DeVoto began his speech, one of
the regular Intermezzo series spon
sored by the Library, with remarks
about novel writing.
"A novel changcs as you write
it. Presently the author becomcs
aware the novel is not at all the
one he intended to write. This is
a very unsettling experience, but
one which all novelists go through,"
DeVoto said.
He illustrated this by a story of
the Harvard professor of biology who

DeVoto will «ive tonight's Tues
day Evening Series lecture, speak
ing on "The Professional Spirit,"
a discussion of the role of the pro
fessional writer.
The talk will begin at 7:30 in
Memorial Auditorium. DeVoto
will be introduced by Richard
Scowcroft, assistant professor of
English.
Since 1935 DeVoto has written
the "Easy Chair" for Harper's.
From 1936 to 1938 he served as
editor of the Saturday Review of
Literature.

told him lie was planning to write
on a subject far removed from biol -
ogy.
DeVoto asked him why he was
doing this.
"To find out what I know about
the subject," the professor replied.
"An author's mind is always at
work on a novel, even when he's
not aware of it. Indeed, this semi
conscious thinking is often the
most important work accomp
lished," DeVoto said.
On the subject of characterization,
DeVoto told his audicnce that most
of the "self portrait" idea in char
acterization can be more accurately
described as the author's identifica
tion of himself with others, not mere
observation.
"Thus an author heroines Na
poleon, Casanova or a football
hero. A character is never a com
plete identification, however, but
fragments of the author appear in
all bis characters," DeVoto em
phasized.
DoVoto said the same process of
thinking that applies to fiction ap
plies to non-fiction too.
"The writing of history is often
more precise and difficult in con
struction than the writing of fiction.
I resent those who consider his
torical writing as non-crcativc," he
declared.
DeVoto spoke of the long and
changing work involved in the writ
ing of his book "The Course of Em
pire," which will be published next
fall.
"I intended this to be a story of
the Lewis and Clark expedition
when I started gathering material
in 1 !K57." DeVoto said. "I gathered
material for years. I travelled the
entire route of the expedition three
times. And finally one summer
when I was staying at Vermillion.
South Dakota, I realized that I
was writing about the whole great
route from the Atlantic to the Pa
cific, instead of just Lewis and
Clark."
"On page 475 Lewis and Clark
finally make the book," he laughed.
DeVoto closed his talk with gen
oral remarks on the task of writing.
"The hardest job of the honest
writer is to determine the moments
he is on the right track. Every
writer goes through this experience;
most survive it,"he concluded.

observation.
"Thus an author heroines Na
poleon, Casanova or a football
hero. A character is never a com

fragments of the author appear in
all bis characters," DeVoto em
phasized.
DoVoto said the same process of
thinking that applies to fiction ap
plies to non-fiction too.
"The writing of history is often
more precise and difficult in con

I resent those who consider his

DeVoto spoke of the long and
changing work involved in the writ
ing of his book "The Course of Em
pire," which will be published next
fall.
"I intended this to be a story of
the Lewis and Clark expedition
when I started gathering material
in 1 !K57." DeVoto said. "I gathered
material for years. I travelled the
entire route of the expedition three
times. And finally one summer
when I was staying at Vermillion.
South Dakota, I realized that I
was writing about the whole great
route from the Atlantic to the Pa
cific, instead of just Lewis and
Clark."
"On page 475 Lewis and Clark
finally make the book," he laughed.
DeVoto closed his talk with gen
oral remarks on the task of writing.
"The hardest job of the honest
writer is to determine the moments
he is on the right track. Every
writer goes through this experience;
most survive it,"he concluded.
Bernard DeVoto told 200 people crowded into the library's
Bender Room yesterday that the fear of the academic historian
that he doesn't know enough about his subject is one of the big
gest obstacles holding back good historical writing today.
"History will take its proper place again only when the literary

man starts to write it. The
must stop studying at some point
and start writing about what he
knows," the quick speaking author
said.
DeVoto said Francis Parkman,
author of "The Oregon Trail,"
typified the first great era of Ameri
can historical writing.
DeVoto began his speech, one of
the regular Intermezzo series spon
sored by the Library, with remarks
about novel writing.
"A novel changcs as you write
it. Presently the author becomcs
aware the novel is not at all the
one he intended to write. This is
a very unsettling experience, but
one which all novelists go through,"
DeVoto said.
He illustrated this by a story of
the Harvard professor of biology who

Literature.

told him lie was planning to write
on a subject far removed from biol -
ogy.
DeVoto asked him why he was
doing this.
"To find out what I know about
the subject," the professor replied.
"An author's mind is always at
work on a novel, even when he's
not aware of it. Indeed, this semi
conscious thinking is often the
most important work accomp
lished," DeVoto said.
On the subject of characterization,
DeVoto told his audicnce that most
of the "self portrait" idea in char
acterization can be more accurately
described as the author's identifica
