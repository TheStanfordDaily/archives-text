# MAY 1
## Rebate Slips Come Due 
### 
Rebate slips, those green receipts
from the Bookstore you've been sav
ing since May 1951, fall due this
Thursday. On that day a new color
will start the rebate slips for the
next fiscal year.
"Students should turn in their re
bate slips as soon as possible in or
der to share in the profits of the
Stanford Bookstore. I sincerely hope
every student takes advantage of the
rebate program which pays from 15
to 20 per cent every year," stated
Mrs. Bauchou, manager of the Book
store.
The procedure for submitting the
slips is:
1. Secure a rebate envelope at the
bookstore.
2. List each receipt as to date and
amount on the front of the envelope
and total them.
3. Put the slips in the envelope
and deposit them at the Bookstore.
Cash payments will be made on or
before June 10. People who will not
be here then may enclose a self
addressed stamped envelope with
their receipts and a check will be
mailed to them sometime after Sep
tember 1.
The deadline for handing in rebate
slips is May 15. None will be ac
cepted after this date.
