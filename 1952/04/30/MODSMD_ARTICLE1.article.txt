# STEEL SEIZURE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL
## Murray Orders Strike Of 650,000 Steel workers 
### 
PITTSBURGH, April 29 (UP)—
Within a half-hour after Federal
Judge David A. Pine announced
his decision, CIO Steelworkers'
Union President Philip Murray
issued an "immediate" strike no
lice. He said:
"Judge Pine's decision ousting
the government from possession
of the steel plants leaves the
members of the union with no
alternative but to cease work im
mediately in the absence of collective
bargaining contracts. Stand-by ar
rangements as usual will be nego
tiated on the local level."
Murray's work stoppage order
caught the f>.">o,ooo union members
by surprise, but the steelworkers
heeded it and began closing down
steel furnaces quickly in plants
across the country.
Thousands walked off night shifts
and picketing was started in such
big steel producing centers as Pitts
burgh, Chicago, Gary, Ind., Cleve
land, Buffalo and Detroit.
At Jones and Laughlin's South
Side plant here, where 12,000 are
employed, many maintenance men
joined the walkout in bitter pro
test against the latest development
in the months-long steel crisis.
Supervisory employees carrying
suitcases were prevented from en
tering the plant to carry on neces
sary maintenance work throughout
a work stoppage.
Later, however, a union spokes
man said maintenance crews would
do their job of putting the J. & L
Steel furnaces "to sleep."
At other plants across the country
preparations were made for an
orderly shutdown. Night workers
in some areas were told to stay on
the job until the completion of their
shift.
By tomorrow morning, the shut
down of the nation's basic steel in
dustry will be nearly complete, with
a daily loss of approximately 300,000
tons of vital steel.
The militant rank-and-file steel
workers were generally embittered
by the steel wage-price deadlock.

| WASHINGTON. April 20 (UP)
—Federal Judge David A. Pine
today overthrew President Tru
j man's seizure of the steel in
dustry and CIO President Philip
Murray ordered an immediate
strike by his 650,000 United
Steclworkers.
In a history-making court de
rision, Pine ruled that Mr. Tru
man's seizure of the nation's
steel plants on April 8 was un
constitutional and contrary to the
U.S. form of government. lie held
that it sm«cke<l of totalitarianism.
The National Production Authority
immediately banned shipments of
steel from warehouses to manu
facturers of civilian goods and for
export. The order does not conccrn
steel plants not involved in the
strike, but they produce only about
five per cent of the nation's output.
The Justice Department was ex
pected to ask Pine for an immedi
ate stay of judgment pending a
review hv a higher court.
II was the' first time in the na
tion's history that a federal court
had enjoined an administrative act
of the president.
Pine <lid not immediately issue
the injunction which the steel in
dustry sought against Mr. Tru
man's seizure order. But a court
official said it will come no later
than tomorrow barring a success
ful government move for a stay.
Pine said he found nothing in the
constitution to support the govern
ment's claim of "unlimited" powers
for the President and noted that Mr.
Truman used no law enactcd by Con
gress to take over the steel plants.
"There is no express grant of
power in the constitution authoriz
ing the president to direct this
seizure," Pine said. "There is no
grant of power from which it
reasonably can he implied. There
is no enactment of Congress
authorizing it."
As for government claims that the
President has unlimited "inherent"
powers, the judge said:
"With all due deference and re
spect for that great President of
1 lie United States. I am obliged to
say that bis statements do not com
port with our recognized theory
of government, but with a theory
with which our government of
laws and not of men is constantly
at war."
Secretary of Commerce Charles
Sawyer, government manager of the
seized industry, .said he would take
no action which "would run counter"
to Pine's opinion pending issuance
of the actual court order. He said
any appeal would have to be made
by the Justice Department.
The White House was silent on
the decision and a spokesman said
there would be no immediate com
ment.
Industry attorneys promptly be
gan complying with Pine's request
that they submit the necessary papers
which the judge will sign and thus
grant their request for an injunction
against the presidential seizure or
der. Pine asked for these documents
"with all due speed."
The injunction will not go into
cfTcct until these papers are signed.
Pine's decision was bailed by the
industry. John C. Gall, attorney
for Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co..
said: "the iudge went all the way
in our favor. We're not gloating,
but we feel that our position has
been completely vindicated."
republican members of Congress,
j joined by some Democrats, also gen
erally hailed the decision. They said
a .steel strike was preferable to what
they called the threat to basic Amer
ican liberties posed by the seizure
action.
Kill administration leaders were
! not so pleased. Members of both
parties said the resulting steel
strike was "unfortunate" and
would injure millions of innocent
persons.
House Republican Leader Joseph
W. Martin, Jr., of Massachusetts said
"those of us who believe the con
stitution is the great protector will
breathe a little easier because of this
[ decision."
Obviously upset when a reporter
told him of Judge David A. Pine's
decision, price stabilizer Ellis Arnall
snapped "no comment."
