# Bernard DeVoto Praises ‘The Professional Spirit'

### 
"Good writing is like gold; it's
where you find it. If there is any
thing at all sure, it is that all good
| writing in the United States gets
published."
So said Bernard DeVoto at last
night's Tuesday Evening Series lec
ture as he explained the qualities of
this good writing and its best ex
ponent—the professional writer. De-
Voto —noted writer, historian, critic,
and Pulitzer Prize winner—spoke to
a large crowd in Memorial Audito
rium on the importance of "The
Professional Spirit."

"The writer must be a man who
uses an instrument with the full
knowledge that destruction will fol
low if he uses it wrongly," empha
sized DeVoto. "Society has charged i
writers with the custody of words. |
The important thing is that those |
who have the power to corrupt others |
! with words shall not corrupt them
| selves."
He explained the obligation of the !
writer to emphasize the use of words |
to explain rather than as cxplana- |
tions in themselves, and named the
instinct of workmanship as an es
sential quality in the good writer.
"A virtue of any craft is that it
be done well. There is an ethical i
quality implicit in skill," he ex- j
j plained.
DeVoto contrasted the professional
j writer with his opposite, the dilet
! tante, who is usually a professional
man doing writing on the side.
"The start toward professional
j competence is only a start toward
| reality," he said, pointing out the |
I tendency of the unskilled writer to
be pompous as if impressed with j
i himself. "There is no serious sub
ject in the world that can not he i
j treated gracefully or lightly," he |
j added.
