# Former Student Asks Large Vote
## 
### 
The following letter received yesterday
comes at an appropriate time as students go
to the polls today to elect next year's student
body ollicers. We don't think the author,
Tom Peterson, who attended Stanford in 1950-
51, would object to sharing the contents of
this personal letter with the student body:
"Dear Jack: (McDonald)
"From the many exclusives of the 'only
morning-paper-on-the-peninsula,' I've been fol
lowing the various developments of ihe Farm.
There certainly have been changes (from poli
tical speakers on campus to the collapse of the
boathouse dock). A large percentage of the
changes will develop into improvements that
will benefit all present and future Stanfordites.
One notices these changes when he is at a
distance from the action, as I am.
"There are unlimited advantages that one has
at Stanford, from the liberal late leaves of the
girls to the honor system. But many of the ad
vantages are ones that you can not place a
label upon. Numerous advantages are not ap
preciated, that is until you are no longer able
to enjoy them. Believe me I know from per
sonal experience.
"Somehow, Jack, I hope that you will be able
to impress upon all Stanfordites that THEY are
the ones—each and every one of them—who
are to decide what Stanford is to be like. Any

school may be fortunate enough to have the
excellant staff of instructors and administrators
that Stanford has. But only Stanford has the
'Stanford spirit.' The words 'Stanford spirit' are
a label for all those undefineable qualities that
makes the Farm the great place that it is. And
it will be only as great as the students want to
make it.
"The most important opportunity that each
student has to help keep Stanford great and to
insure that it will progress is during elections.
It is only by electing officers who have the new
ideas, the drive, and the ability for the office
that they are seeking that there will be prog
ress. For a voter not to know the qualities of
each candidate, and especially not to vote, is
to cast a vote for not wanting Stanford to remain
great.
"Show every student that he or she should
vote, Jack. Each vote helps to insure thai the
Farm will remain as great as it is and that it
will correct the faults that may lie within. It is
each Stanfordite's obligation for those who are
to follow them on the Farm. By having one
hundred percent voting—and interested and in
telligent voting—the Stanford students will al
low the best man 01 woman to win.
Sincerely yours,
(signed) THOMAS K. PETERSON '54"
