## Robeson Editorial—'A Piece of Juvenile Information' 
### 
To tlio Editor:
At times I am amused at your editorials and at other
times I am ashamed of them. At the' present time I
am ashamed for it is evident that through a lack of
understanding and reason you have written a piece
of juvenile information that intelligent people know
is not at all characteristic of the average college stu
dent. We are here in this University to learn to think
and it is time that you commence.
I will state a few categoric questions to you and I
hope that you will answer them.
Have you ever heard Paul Robeson sing? Have you
ever seen or heard the blasphemous things that he
has said of our educational system here in the United
States? (May I say that if you wish to rationalize
this by saying that criticism should be bourn (sic)
where it is due, you should bear this letter with all
humility and concern.) Further have you any idea
: s to the possible interest that Harry Bridges and the
longshoremen have in bringing Paul Robeson, an
avowed Communist, to San Francisco at the present
time? Further, may I ask where the majority of you
on the Editorial Board come from?
Taking your editorial point by point I find the fol
lowing errors in your reasoning:
The benefit that the Communist propaganda ma
chine will derive from the refusal of San Francisco
is no greater than the benefit that would he de
rived from an acceptance of Paul Robeson. The
manner and means that the Communists use to
distort and falsify information is such that the truth
to them is unknown. The fact that we accepted such
an anti-pathetic person as Robeson is to them a sign
that we are cracking and at least fully realizing that
we cannot stop the infiltration of their forces into
this country. Feel as you will, you must admit that
they can make any kind of a story they wish out of
any story that is presented them.
Passing on to your statement that the Opera House
Board is confusing art and politics. It seems to me
that in the recent past you were somewhat against
allowing the Young Republicans on campus. If this
was not a form of confusion between education and
politics I am a monkey's uncle. Further, just who in
this present question was the first to confuse the art
and the politics. 1 think that you will find Paul Robe
f;on himself was guilty of that when he commenced to

capitalize on his popularity as a singer to move the
people of the United States with his Communist ideas.
In the next paragraph you have anticipated my
argument. But you have also made another error in
your knowledge and lack of experience. I must admit
that you are a young student and not at all familiar
with Paul Robeson of fifteen years ago. You state
your view in such a fashion as to infer that Robeson
is allying himself with the Communist element. This
is wrong. That element is after Robeson for he is the
best and most well known Communist that has per
formed for them in the past years.
I myself have attended the meetings of the so-called
art interested members of that union in the Opera
House in the past. You need not think that Robeson
has never sung in that building, he has. I was there
and I saw the mob tactics that were used and the
straight party line that was used to incite an audience
of art minded longshoremen to frenzy and passion.
The fighting of Communism is not to sit and think
and ponder, it is to act, and by Heaven you tell me
what the United States is doing in Korea if it is not
fighting. You, being a young intellectual, have fallen
for the old line that the philosophers have spit out
for centuries, that is, pacifism.
Robeson is not the only Baritone in the world and
there is some doubt as to his reaching the ranks of
the best. Why, oh why, must you inane idiots give
to the Communists just what you are crying is being
given by the Opera House Board? Answer that.
Why do you not keep your nose out of things of
which you are abysmally ignorant?
In the last paragraph you state that the total effect
of the move of the Board is to do San Francisco a
misservice. I can see only that the misservice is not
to allow those in the city that wish, t# hear Paul
Robeson sing. Is that such a great misservice to the
city? Do you really think that you are so much
smarter than all of the older and wiser heads that
went into the consideration of the decision of the
Board? They too are all college people. They too
have had the grand and glorious education that you
are having. Give credit to the years of experience
arid knowledge that are represented by those people
on that board who have acted well in a different
situation.
