AN OPEN LETTER TO WOMEN'S COUNCIL:
Last Sunday, after a reconsideration of a case in
volving the violation of social regulations and the
Fundamental Standard (a case which, admittedly, you
considered thoughtfully and sincerely) you suspended
from Stanford a last-quarter senior girl.
The case in question involved a girl who was plan
ning to spend the night at a girl friend's home. She
forgot to sign out before closing hours, and, in order
to avoid the penalty for a late sign-out and not want
ing to worry her hostess, in a moment of impulse and
foolishness, left her dorm by "jumping the fence."
Granted this action is a violation of a social regula
tion, and, because it entails deceit, is also contrary to
the Fundamental Standard.
We do not question your decision on her objective
guilt. We do, however, question your interpretation
of the Fundamental Standard in meting out such a
severe punishment.
Are the motives and the resultant action in this case,
although undoubtedly deserving of punishment, of the
nature that warrants a penalty as severe as suspen
sion? If so, apparently we are living under a de
lusion as to exactly what the Fundamental Standard
is.
We realize that by now this case is practically a
dead issue. What we ask from you (as our elected
representatives) in the way of future action is this:
1) A clarification of the meaning of the "spirit"
of the Fundamental Standard as your basis for
judgment.
2) A clarification of the concept of punishment.
Do you not think that just punishment should he
educative as well as punitive?
il) A policy of making the punishment appropriate
and proportionate to the crime. Are there not de
crees of offense which demand varying degrees of
penalty?
We believe that suspending a girl who was due to

graduate in six weeks, arid who has no other serious
offenses on her record, is an unfair and disproportion
ate punishment for "jumping the fence." Another
penalty—for example, suspension of social privileges
and constructive work with the Fundamental Stand
ard Committee—would have been more educational
and more just, in addition to being effectively puni
tive.
4) A consistency in the application of the Funda
mental Standard as it involves both men and women
students; that is, a re-evaluation of the "double
standard" in punishment.
In summary, we request a clarification of the
concepts on which you base your judgments, and de
cisions which more adequately consider individual
circumstances as well as abstract codes.
Yours for a better student judiciary,
