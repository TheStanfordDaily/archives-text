### BARBARA TUERK 
By the end of this week the Admissions Office will have fin
ished typing and mailing the last" of this year's more than 2,900
letters of acceptance or rejection to prospective freshmen all over
the country and world.
In their modern glass and linoleum office on Inner Quad, Dr.

Rixf ord K. Snyder and Dr. E.
aid Brooks, Director and Assistant
Director of Admissions, respective
ly, will at last be able to relax for
a moment before the acknowledg
ing i ostcards start rolling in.
Applications are actually rated by :
a Faculty Admissions Committee, i
To Drs. Snyder and Brooks and
their staff falls the task of explain
ing University policy to a myriad of
high school seniors, receiving and
reviewing applications, and inform
ing applicants of the Committee's
decisions.
1,000 New Frosh
This year approximately 1,000
freshmen will be accepted by the
University.
The Admissions OfTice accepts
more students than there is room
for, making a percentage allowance
for shrinkage. This allowance is
revised every year according to i
specific conditions.
"We rate our applications on a j
point system," explained tall, easy
going Dr. Snyder before disappear
ing again behind a pile of appli
cations. "Then we line them up in
order, and take as many as we have
room for."
The number of acceptances is
limited in general by University '

♦ 1
policy, specifically by the amount of
housing available. However, the
acceptance of any individual is de
pendent on his comparative rank
ing.
Entrance Criteria
What factors determine the Com-
I mittee's rating? There ;;re three
major determinants, all lated
I equally:
I I. Grades. Students are cxpected
to have 11 recommending high
school units in their last three
! years.
2. A satisfactory Scholastic Apti
tude Test score. Present standards
have been set by students previ
ously taking the test.
:t. Personal qualifications, such as
citizenship and extra-curricular ac
tivities. These are determined from
the personal rating blank sent in
| by high school principals and teach
i ers.
Organizationally, the Admissions
OfTice is divided into three sub-de
partments: freshmen, transfers, and
graduates. In making their deci
sions they also work closely with
the Scholarship Ofiice, because of
the large number of acceptable stu
dents who cannot afford to come
I to Stanford without financial aid.
