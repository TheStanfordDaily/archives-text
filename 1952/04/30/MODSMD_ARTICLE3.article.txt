# Oil Strike Threat
## 
### 
DENVER, Wednesday, April lift
An oft - postponed strike against
much of the nation's oil industry
went into effect at 12:01 a.m. local
time today after 11th hour nego
tiating attempts failed to settle the
wage dispute between industry and
a coalition of oil unions.
About 90,000 union workers were
to be involved eventually in the
strike, which was called after the
22 unions failed to reach agreement
with industry over the unions' de
mands for a 25-cent-an-hour wage
increase.
Only California, where refineries
produce most fuel vital to the Ko
rean war effort, was exempted from
the strike.
