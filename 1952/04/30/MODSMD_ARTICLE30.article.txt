# BULL SESSION
## 
### DICK McLEAN 
Have you over had one of those days when every
face you saw reminded you of another person or
another time or a place? Have you ever had a day
that seemed to walk with all the yesterdays? They—
the memory clays—seem to come on Sundays. (Most
people are kind of punchy on Sundays anyway.)

You start down toward the Li
brary from the Cellar. The caf
feine from the Cellar brew is mak
ing a valiant attempt to generate
a bit of the old electric magic
through the nervous system. But
it's a rough go. Sunday afternoon
is a hell of a time to hit the books.
And the body in her primal wis
dom seems to know that today is
the day decreed for rest, both
physical and mental. Thus the

faculty of concentration is happily drugged and the
mind tends to wander along the bi-directional path
of time.
You see a fellow who played freshman football the
same time that you did. He seemed to have what it,
took and now he plays varsity.
"Hello, Jim," you say.
"Hello."
Football . . . and afternoon . . . Fall.
The quiet Sunday of the present fades away as
does the Quad and the Library and the people. It's
not spring quarter hut autumn and the grass under
your feet is the turf of the football field. You can
almost feel your cleats biting into it. The stadium
springs up around you. The trees become hanks of
spectators and the wind in the leaves becomes the
roar of the crowd. You're going to make a touch
down today. Ninety yards. All the way. No one
will he able to stop you. And all the big dreams of
freshman football players run through your mind
once again. "Varsity." "All-American." "Beat Cal."

The only hitch in the dreaming is that you never
even got that game when you were a freshman.
Nor could you have made the touchdown. (Guards
don't usually score.) And the grass under foot be
comes ordinary lawn grass and the trees become
trees again. But the dreaming's been fun anyway.
A cute freshman coed swishes down the path toward
you. She's still fresh from high school and hasn't
learned to be collegiate and brittle and sophisticated
yet. (But who's complaining?)
She passes with a big smile and a small "hello."
"Hello," you say and almost reverse your direc
tion. There must be something you've forgotten that
would rationalize an about-face. But no, you continue
along.
Your mind, however, is not bound by convention
and social control so it skips off after the young lovely.
Your empty body, zombie-like, keeps walking but
the memory is elsewhere.
Another girl . . . another day ... a party.
The afternoon that you cut all your classes and
on an impulse you left for the coastside. A con
vertible with the top down filled with laughing
people and the wind. Beach parties with lots of
sun and sand and laughter. And a bonlire for the
evening.
The formal parties, the beer busts, the afternoons
at the lake. They all come back. Yoii remember
all the girls you didn't take out. The one with the
dark hair. The one who walked like Ava Gardner.
And all the others. You remember the Friday nights
that you spent studying. You remember the Satur
day afternoons you passed writing papers.
As you nearly trip over the steps to the Library,
you come back into the present.
"I must be getting old." you tell yourself angrily.
Then you go into the quiet stacks and try to keep
your mind on the dusty books. But for some reason
. . . no one knows why . . . your mind tends to wander.
