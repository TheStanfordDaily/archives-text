## ... And in The Majors 
### 
Rain played havoc with major
league schedules this past
week. The necessity of making
up rained-out games by playing
double-headers makes it ques
tionable whether April showers
will bring May flowers.
It is too early to say whether
veteran teams .such as Cleveland
and Brooklyn or rookie - manned
clubs such as the Browns, the Red
Sox, and the Yanks will benefit from
the long hot summer, made more
tiring by innumerable double
headtrs resulting from spring wash
outs. But such worries are a few
months away.
Looking at the pennant race after
two wt eks of play, we see the
Dodgers still on top in the National
loop and Boston having replaced
Cleveland in the American League.
However, the big surprises are
the Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati in
the senior circuit and still St. Louis
in the American. The Cubs have
taken tHe place of the White Sox
in the hearts of Chicagoans.
It was only last year that th?
White Sox were pacing the Ameri
can loop. But today the spirited
Cubs, under frosh manager Phi Ca
varretta, are only a half-game out
ol first place. The Cubs are second
in team baiting and third in fielding
in the National League. Their surge
thus far is no fluke.
llie Reds are also right up there.
However, they lack the consistent
hitting. It isn't unusual tha f the
Dodgers are ppcing the loop, con
fidering their almost .300 team hit
ting average and a near - perfect
fielding mark, having committed
only two errors in 313 chances over
eight games. Jackie Robinson,
Dodger second sacker, is leading the
National League bat race with an
amazing .478. He is closely followed
by mates Roy Campanella and Carl
PuriMo.
In the American circuit, Boston,
with a good crop of rookies and vet
erans who are finally playing ball,
is leading the league in standings
and butting. Once again, fielding is
a weak cog in the Boston machine.
The St. Louis Browns are still
amazing all. Rookie Jim Rivera dis
appointed last week especially in
the Chicago series. Rivera fanned
six consecutive times against White
Sox hurling and on the whole failed
to bit effectively.
The Yanks have fallen farther
behind and are now more out of
contention (four games) than at
any lime last season. The rookie
strength might possibly save New
York as the season draws into its
twilight.
As for pitching, Ken Raffensber
ger of the Reds, Early Wynn of
the Indians, and Gerry Staley of the
Cards all have three win, no loss
records.
This week finds the Western
clubs of the American League
swinging East with Cleveland start
ing the week at Philly, St. Louis in
a bang-up series with the Yanks,
Detroit challenging Boston, and
Chicago in the capital city.
In the National, Boston opens at
Pittsburgh, Brooklyn at St. Louis,
New York at Cincy, and Philadel
phia at Chicago.
