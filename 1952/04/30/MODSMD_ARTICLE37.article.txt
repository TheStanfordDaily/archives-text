# Essegian Homers Again As Indians Triumph, 6-4
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
Led by Chuck Essegian's tenth homer of the season, the Stan
ford baseball team edged a visiting San Jose State squad yester
day, 6-4.
The four-bagger, twenty-third to be hit in the Sunken Diamond
by a collegian, occurred in the second inning. It started a four-

run rally for the Indians that put
them ahead. Essegian also had a
walk and a single to lead the Stan
ford nine.
Bob Murphy started on the hill
for the Indians, and gave up a run
in the first frame on a walk, a single,
and a double by clean-up hitter
Andy Miller. Following Essegian's
homer with none on, two errors and
a pair of singles netted three more
tallies in the second frame.
doing the distance for San Jose
was Claire Parkin, fast bailer who
was undefeated until today. He
wilted six, while walking two.
A single, a walk, and an error
netted a fifth run for Stanford, and
that ended the scoring until the

eighth, when a 360-foot double by
catcher Dick Corzine drove in Dave
Rosenkrantz, who had singled.
The Indians had to stave off a
rally by the visitors in the ninth.
Two consecutive errors, a single, and
a double netted three runs and put
the tying tallies on second and third.
An infield out ended the game.
Returning to action for the first
time was Art Abrahamson, who
entered the game in the sixth.
Abrahamson has been sidelined for
months with an injury.
Murphy left the game in the fourth,
in order that he may start Saturday's
game against California. Don De-
Long took over on the hill and did
a credible job, allowing only five
hits.
