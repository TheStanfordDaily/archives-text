# Coach Rupp Accused In Fix Case
## 
### 
NEW YORK, April 29 (UP) â€”
Kentucky basketball coach Adolph
Rupp was accused today of openly
discussing gambling with I4; play
ers and even dressing them down
when a friend lost a bet.
Judge Saul Streit blasted the vet
eran coach in a G3-page statement
as he freed three ex-Kentucky stars
with suspended sentences on bas
ketball fixing charges. He called
players Alex Groza and Ralph
Beard dupes of others, and he also
set free Dale Barnstable in view of
his war record. The trio admitted
taking a bribe to fix the Loyola-
Kentucky game here in 1949, and
Barnstable also admitted drawing
two other players into the fix ring.
But it was Rupp that the angry
judge scored for consorting with at
least one "notorious bookmaker."
Judge Streit said:
"Beard said he remembers the
occasion in Cincinnati when Rupp
came into the (hotel) room and said,
'I just called Kurd and got the
points. We are favored by 15. Now
these guys will be tough, so let's
pour it on.'"
Kurd was identified by Judge
Streit as "a notorious bookmaker in
Lexington, Ky."
"Hir?eh (who admits fixing games
out of the New York court's juris
diction) reports that in December
of 1950 when he was captain of the
team after it had beaten Kansas,
Mr. Rupp gave him and each of the
five starting players $50. A week
later, he said, after they beat St.
John's, Mr. Rupp again gave each
of the starting players $50. There
after Mr. Rupp said to him, 'Win
the Sugar Bowl and you'll get an
other $50,' " the judge said.
