## Mathias, Magee Healthy For Cal Meet Saturday 
### 
Coach Jack Weiershauser ran his
track team through a heavy work
out yesterday afternoon. The activ
ity took place in the Stadium, the
site of this coming Saturday's Big
Meet with the potent California
Bears.
The Beors have a very strong
team with depth in nearly every
event. Last weekend they had a bit
of trouble downing the UCLA
Bruins down in West wood. Earlier,
though, the Bears grabbed 54 points
from the mighty Trojans.
Most important news is that Bob
Mathias is in good shape and will
be ready for full duty once aagin.
Bob Magee, except for a little ten
derness on the heel, has been given
the go-ahead.
Although the mfet is still several

days off, Weiershauser called the
extra-heavy workout because of the
unpredictable weather. Later word
from the weathermen is scattered
showers for the rest of the week
which would definitely put a d&nip
ener on training.
The terrific showing of several
newcomers was the high point of
last weekend's meet with Oxy.
Keith Browns berger, a very con
sistent sprinter, placed in both the
100 and 220 and looks like h sure
starter against Cal next week.
Hurdler Gerry Wood, who ran his
first full flight of barriers against
Oxy, looked good doing :25 and:15.
The biggest problem is whipping
up the Card broad jumpers, pole
vaulters, and high junipers.
