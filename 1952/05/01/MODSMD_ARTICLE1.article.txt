# Strike Problems Go On
## Government Plea Backed 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 30 (UP) â€”
The government won back tempo
rarily control of the .steel industry
by a 5-4 split decision in a whirl
wind court battle today after prom
ising to break up the paralyzing
steel strike.
CIO President Philip Murray gave
no immediate indication whether he
would voluntarily call off the strike
of hij 050,000 United Steelworkers.
He refused to comment on the gov
ernment victory and said "there
will he no word going out to the
men tonight."
Five members of a "very unus
ual" nine-man appeals court backed
demands of a blue-ribbon battery
of government attorneys for an or
der to block enforcement of a tem
porary injunction issued a few
hours earlier to return the mills to
private ownership.
Four judges said the government
failed to show any reason why the
appeals court should upset Federal
Judge David A. Pine's opinion that
President Truman exceeded his con
stitutional powers in seizing the in
dustry.
The stay older gives the Justice
Department until 4:30 p.m. EDT
Friday to appeal the seizure issue
directly to the Supreme Court. The
action means the government will
remain in control of the mills until
the courts rule on the historic seiz
ure issue.
Acting Attorney General Philip
B. Perlman said he can file the case
possibly tomorrow and certainly by
Friday. If so, seizure will continue
until the high bench has decided
whether to accept it. If the Su
preme Court refuses immediate re
view, the stop order will continue
until the case can he processed
through lower court channels.
