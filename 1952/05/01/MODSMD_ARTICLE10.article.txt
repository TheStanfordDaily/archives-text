## 
### 
The Stanford Players' production
of "Billy Budd," featuring an all
male cast, opens tonight at 8:15 in
Memorial Auditorium.
The main action of the play,
which is based on Herman Mel
ville's novel of the sea, takes place
on the deck of His majesty's war
ship "The Indomitable" during the
Napoleonic wars.
Cast members had to learn some
acrobatic skill as well as their lines.
Rope ratlines, stretching 30 feet
above the stage, are rigged to make
up the main mast of the sailing ves
sel. The agile actors have to climb
the ropes with all the abandon of
experienced seamen.
Ed Williams, who plays the role
of Billy Budd, is supposed to be the
nimblest member of the crew; and
Ed finds himself spending more
time practicing on the ropes than
he does rehearsing the role.
Hal Burdick Jr., a young petty
officer making his first cruise, is the
only one who is permitted to show
any sign of fear as lie swings on the
high ropes.
Besides the rope-climbing, sev
eral knife fights add to the action
of the play. "Billy Budd," while it
is an exciting melodrama, is also a
serious philosophical play which
discusses the eternal conflict be
tween right and wrong. While the
play's setting is during the Napo
leonic wars, it deals with problems
that are aroused during any armed
conflict.
The play will end its run Satur
day night. Tickets, selling for 75
cents each, can still be obtained at
the Memorial Auditorium box office.
