## 
### 
New members for the top activi
ties organ of the ASSU will be cho
sen Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday,
when an estimated 40 applicants
will be interviewed for Cardinals.
Five sophomores and five juniors
will be selected for the 10 junior
and senior members needed for the

All-Campus Functions
Cardinals operates directly under
Excoin and has the job of conduct
ing ASSU - sponsored social and
charitable functions of an all-cam
pus nature. Besides handling such
traditional events as Big Game,
Homecoming, and Con Home Week,
Cardinals also co-ordinates the
street banner, football movies, Pre-
Reg, the Frosh Handbook, and Rally
Com activities.
In directing such events, one Car
dinal is appointed chairman of a
particular project, and he then ap
points sub-chairmen from Cardi
nals or the campus at large. Past
experience and activities thus count
heavily in selecting Cardinals mem
bers, although President Chuck Ma
louf said, "The willingness and abil
ity to work arc the primary con
cerns."
Membership
Applicants are graded on a rating
scale .set up by Dr. Donald W. Tay
lor of the Stanford Psychology Dc

of Cardinals, the ASSU vice-presi
dent and chairman of Rally Com
are also members, giving a voting

The president of Cardinals is
picked from among the senior five
