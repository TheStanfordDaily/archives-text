# Dining Halls and Campus Opinion
## 
### 
In today's Campus Opinion columns, four
students offer their ideas on a problem that is
perennially subject matter for heated student
discussions —the problem of university dining
halls and food. Even though we respect the
right of these letter writers to express their
views, we would take issue with them on two
points.
First, the "facts" which provide the basis
lor several guestions in the letter are without
substantiation. To correct just one misstate
ment ol lacts —the milk is regularly checked
by the University lor buttertat content, and
it is not ol less content than the competing
brands (latest Figures show all brands uni
lormly at the state reguired 3.5 limit).
Furthermore, the "many occasions" that the
milk has been found to contain impurities was
only once, a year and a half ago—and the cause
was traced down by health authorities and im
mediately eliminated.
We presume the writers derived these facts,
along with most of their information on the
subject from the cited ex-employee. Yet we
question how much this "former chef" knows
about the management of the university dining
halls and such subjects as the "subsidation of
the other campus dining halls" by Encina Com
mons.
Secondly, we would take issue with the
v/riters because ol their attitude. The Uni
versity has olten expressed its willingness to
hear with an open mind constructive criticism
ol its administration. However we would
hardly consider today's Campus Opinion a
constructive approach to solving the prob
lems cited.
As we have investigated some of the ques

tions posed by the letter below, we have dis
covered that Stanford's dining halls manage
ment is considered to be outstanding among
the nation's universities. We get this impres
sion because the directors of this work at Stan
ford—Alf Brandin, Miss Christine Ricker, and
others —have been recognized as leaders in the
field by personnel at other universities. This
recognition has manifested itself in the election
and appointment of these persons to offices in
their respective national professional organi
zations.
In addition although we may disagree with
the University administration on some issues,
we cannot guite bring ourselves to the con
clusion that they are trying to lleece us by
deliberate mismanagement of the dining
halls.
In spite of the occasional misstatement of
the truth and antagonistic attitude of the Cam
pus Opinion below, we would not discount it
entirely. For it does show that there is current
student thought on the problem of dining halls'
management. Our evidence would suggest
that the incidence of this thought should not be
minimized. Thus we recommend to the Uni
versity that serious consideration be given to
several ideas presented by the writers below in
their criticism.
Especially we would cite the attitude of "cer
tain dining hall directors." A great many stu
dent diners do feel that this attitude is not "one
of concern and service to the students." It is
the dining hall director who will create a favor
able or unfavorable impression of efficient and
able management, and at the sarna time assure
satisfied or dissatisfied "customers."

In addition although we may disagree with
the University administration on some issues,
we cannot guite bring ourselves to the con
clusion that they are trying to lleece us by
deliberate mismanagement of the dining
halls.
In spite of the occasional misstatement of
the truth and antagonistic attitude of the Cam
pus Opinion below, we would not discount it
entirely. For it does show that there is current
student thought on the problem of dining halls'
management. Our evidence would suggest
that the incidence of this thought should not be
minimized. Thus we recommend to the Uni
versity that serious consideration be given to
several ideas presented by the writers below in
their criticism.
Especially we would cite the attitude of "cer
tain dining hall directors." A great many stu
dent diners do feel that this attitude is not "one
of concern and service to the students." It is
the dining hall director who will create a favor
able or unfavorable impression of efficient and
able management, and at the sarna time assure
satisfied or dissatisfied "customers."

In today's Campus Opinion columns, four
students offer their ideas on a problem that is
perennially subject matter for heated student
discussions —the problem of university dining
halls and food. Even though we respect the
right of these letter writers to express their
views, we would take issue with them on two
points.
First, the "facts" which provide the basis
lor several guestions in the letter are without
substantiation. To correct just one misstate
ment ol lacts —the milk is regularly checked
by the University lor buttertat content, and
it is not ol less content than the competing
brands (latest Figures show all brands uni
lormly at the state reguired 3.5 limit).
Furthermore, the "many occasions" that the
milk has been found to contain impurities was
only once, a year and a half ago—and the cause
was traced down by health authorities and im
mediately eliminated.
We presume the writers derived these facts,
along with most of their information on the
subject from the cited ex-employee. Yet we
question how much this "former chef" knows
about the management of the university dining
halls and such subjects as the "subsidation of
the other campus dining halls" by Encina Com
mons.
Secondly, we would take issue with the
v/riters because ol their attitude. The Uni
versity has olten expressed its willingness to
hear with an open mind constructive criticism
ol its administration. However we would
hardly consider today's Campus Opinion a
constructive approach to solving the prob
lems cited.
As we have investigated some of the ques

tions posed by the letter below, we have dis
covered that Stanford's dining halls manage
ment is considered to be outstanding among
the nation's universities. We get this impres
sion because the directors of this work at Stan
ford—Alf Brandin, Miss Christine Ricker, and
others —have been recognized as leaders in the
field by personnel at other universities. This
recognition has manifested itself in the election
and appointment of these persons to offices in
their respective national professional organi
zations.
In addition although we may disagree with
the University administration on some issues,
we cannot guite bring ourselves to the con
clusion that they are trying to lleece us by
