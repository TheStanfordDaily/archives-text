# CAMPUS OPINION
## Dining Halls 'Lose Sight' of Service to Students 
### 
To the Editor:
WHERE DOES YOUR FOOD DOLLAR GO?
Only 55<J of your food dollar goes toward the actual
buying of food. What becomes of the other 45<?
The easiest way of meeting the costs problem in a
non-profit, non-competitive system, such as our cam
pus dining halls is a simple one of raising the price to
the students.
But, we are not convinced that better management
and more efficient operation of the dining halls can
not be achieved. Certainly this v/ould be the only
way, if the threat of competition had to be met.
In their dedication to serve the University, often
times the supervisors lose sight of the more im
portant duty of serving the student, which is after all
the ultimate excuse for its existence.
After having talked with the former chef, one who
had been employed by the University for some 5
years, and who is in a position to know something
about the subject in general, and certainly about our
own situation, there are several questions which
bother us in regard to campus dining halls.
(We will not go into the Cellar situation, which is a
subject in itself.)
1. In one of our dining halls, the paying students
are carrying some 75 non-paying meal ticket holders.
Can't this be cut down?
2. Ice cream, which costs more to make here on
campus, than the price on the open market (of brands
such as Bordens), Is one of the most frequently
served desserts. Why?
3. Why is so much spent on pastries, cakes, and
other expensive desserts, at the expense of better meat
cuts?
4. Why is corporation yard maintenance time, prop
erly chargeable to other departments, allowed to be
charged against the dining halls?
5. Pier's milk, of less butter fat content than com

petitive brands, and on many occasions having been
found to contain impurities is served exclusively.
Does it have any connection with the land rented by
the dairy from the University?
6. Are the dining halls over-staffed?
7. Why must we get up in the middle of the night,
in order to get a decent breakfast? (Here again, the
idea of serving the students' needs, is lost sight of.)
8. The attitude of certain dining hall directors is
certainly a far cry from one of concern and service
to the students.
9. Encina meal ticket buyers subsidize the other
campus dining halls, which are not able to meet ex
penses.
If this sounds like a personal gripe, we assure you,
it is not, but rather an expression of current opinion.
In fact, so many of the Crolhers men became dis
gusted with the situation, that they moved out of the
dormitory entirely, so that there are not even enough
Law students to fill the dormitory, and undergradu
ates, and other students had to be moved in to fill
the vacancies.
In fact, perhaps this letter will encourage more
opinions on this subject, especially since we are
promised even higher prices next year. After all we
are paying, and should be entitled to a voice on how
OUR money is being spent for us.
There are probably many other steps which could
be taken to improve the dining hall conditions, and
perhaps a thorough study would prove a better
answer to meeting costs, than the simpler expediency
of '"let the student pay."

WHERE DOES YOUR FOOD DOLLAR GO?
Only 55<J of your food dollar goes toward the actual
buying of food. What becomes of the other 45<?
The easiest way of meeting the costs problem in a
non-profit, non-competitive system, such as our cam
pus dining halls is a simple one of raising the price to
the students.
But, we are not convinced that better management
and more efficient operation of the dining halls can
not be achieved. Certainly this v/ould be the only
way, if the threat of competition had to be met.
In their dedication to serve the University, often
times the supervisors lose sight of the more im
portant duty of serving the student, which is after all
the ultimate excuse for its existence.
After having talked with the former chef, one who
had been employed by the University for some 5
years, and who is in a position to know something
about the subject in general, and certainly about our
own situation, there are several questions which
bother us in regard to campus dining halls.
(We will not go into the Cellar situation, which is a
subject in itself.)
1. In one of our dining halls, the paying students
are carrying some 75 non-paying meal ticket holders.
Can't this be cut down?
2. Ice cream, which costs more to make here on
campus, than the price on the open market (of brands
such as Bordens), Is one of the most frequently
served desserts. Why?
3. Why is so much spent on pastries, cakes, and
other expensive desserts, at the expense of better meat
cuts?
4. Why is corporation yard maintenance time, prop
erly chargeable to other departments, allowed to be
charged against the dining halls?
5. Pier's milk, of less butter fat content than com
