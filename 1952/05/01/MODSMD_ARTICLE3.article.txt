BERLIN â€” The United States.
France, and Britain tonight accused
Russia of a "brutal" and "unwar
ranted" attack on an Air France
airliner in their second "vehement"
protest of the incident in 24 hours.
Western civil and military planes
were ordered back into the air cor
ridors today despite the implied
Russian threat to force other West
ern aircraft down if they wandered
out of, the 20-mile-wide air corri
dors.
