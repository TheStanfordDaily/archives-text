# Against the Robeson Ban
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I agree wholeheartedly with the sentiment expressed
in the Daily editorial April 29th on the Paul Robeson
affair. It was an editorial, and as such expressed one
point oi' view. With this in mind, after reading it I
reserved one side of the mental ledger for the op
posing opinion. That side was written in by the letter
published Wednesday. After reading Wilbur John
son's somewhat vitriolic barrage on the original edi
torial I cannot see where he has made a dent in it.
If his line of reasoning is the best the opposition party
can present, I think the opinion of the editorial board
has been proved valid.
Mr. Robeson is an artist. He was to appear in San
Francisco in that capacity. I do not purport to pass
judgment on his talent in his field—l leave that to
those who would have gone to the War Memorial
Opera House to hear him. They have been denied
that privilege, and I think the basis for the denial is
ethically wrong.
Mr. Robeson is also an avowed communist. I do
not sympathize with his political views, yet I respect
his l ight to hold them. I respect his right, as well as
that of any man, to say what he pleases to anyone who
will listen to him.
If Mr, Robeson wishes to give a political speech,

let him find an auditorium in which to voice his
opinions. If he is denied the use of an auditorium
for that purpose, the basis for that denial may be
defended ethically.
I can see no moral defense, however, for the stand
taken by the Opera House Board in refusing to allow
him to sing when that denial was based solely on
his political affiliations.
Wilbur Johnson defends their position. He refers
to the "older and wiser heads" who made the de
cision. We should "give credit to the years of ex
perience and knowledge" of the people on the board,
and thereby accept their decision as the correct one.
I respect Mr. Johnson's appreciation of age and
wisdom. I would ask, however, that if he is going
to use this to bolster his specious reasoning that he
at least be consistent. In the previous paragraph he
refers to those v/ho disagree with thp board's decision
as "having fallen for the old line that the philosophers
have spit out for centuries, that is, pacifism."
Maybe if more people had fallen for this "old
line" over the centuries there would be no war in
Korea today, and there would not be such a hulla
baloo over the granting of a small privilege to some
one whose ideas differed from those of the general
public.

Wilbur Johnson defends their position. He refers
to the "older and wiser heads" who made the de
cision. We should "give credit to the years of ex
perience and knowledge" of the people on the board,
and thereby accept their decision as the correct one.
I respect Mr. Johnson's appreciation of age and
wisdom. I would ask, however, that if he is going
to use this to bolster his specious reasoning that he
at least be consistent. In the previous paragraph he
refers to those v/ho disagree with thp board's decision
as "having fallen for the old line that the philosophers
have spit out for centuries, that is, pacifism."
Maybe if more people had fallen for this "old
line" over the centuries there would be no war in
Korea today, and there would not be such a hulla
baloo over the granting of a small privilege to some
one whose ideas differed from those of the general
public.

To the Editor:
I agree wholeheartedly with the sentiment expressed
in the Daily editorial April 29th on the Paul Robeson
affair. It was an editorial, and as such expressed one
point oi' view. With this in mind, after reading it I
reserved one side of the mental ledger for the op
posing opinion. That side was written in by the letter
published Wednesday. After reading Wilbur John
son's somewhat vitriolic barrage on the original edi
torial I cannot see where he has made a dent in it.
If his line of reasoning is the best the opposition party
can present, I think the opinion of the editorial board
has been proved valid.
Mr. Robeson is an artist. He was to appear in San
Francisco in that capacity. I do not purport to pass
judgment on his talent in his field—l leave that to
those who would have gone to the War Memorial
Opera House to hear him. They have been denied
that privilege, and I think the basis for the denial is
ethically wrong.
Mr. Robeson is also an avowed communist. I do
not sympathize with his political views, yet I respect
his l ight to hold them. I respect his right, as well as
that of any man, to say what he pleases to anyone who
will listen to him.
If Mr, Robeson wishes to give a political speech,

let him find an auditorium in which to voice his
opinions. If he is denied the use of an auditorium
for that purpose, the basis for that denial may be
defended ethically.
I can see no moral defense, however, for the stand
taken by the Opera House Board in refusing to allow
him to sing when that denial was based solely on
his political affiliations.
