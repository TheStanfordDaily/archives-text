# [illegible] 56th Big Meet Rates as Toss-Up; Braves Favored
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
While mo°t track enthusiasts are
filing into the huge Stanford Sta
dium for the Big Meet this Satur
day, a hustling batch of youngsters
known as the Stanford Braves will
match times with the equally young
hustlers from the combined Cal
Blues and GoJd.s in the junior var
sity "topper" of the season.
Tilt* meet will start at 12:110
and promises to be as hotly mu
te, ted as the varsity affair that is
run with it. California, over Hoo
ded with atletes as usual, has two
junior vavsitv teams, the Blues
and Golds. They will combine
their talents to try and defeat the
potent Braves, beaten only once
this year, and that by Sacramento
in tiie (flopped baton incident.
The Braves are favored to take
the meet, but some come-through
performances will be needed. Russ
Ferguson in the mile will have to
fight off Cal's Frans Doleman for
top honors. Both boys usually do
the four laps in the high 4:; Jo's.
The 440 shapes up to be a close
duel between Stanford's Walt Gar
rett and Cal's Ait. Stewart. Both
are capable of 50 fiat, but Walt has
a slight edge on past performances.
Cal's Ed Hersh should cross the
tape first in the two-lapper with
a season best of J:. r »B.!J for Cal's
only sure first place.
Ihe junior Bears are extremely
weak in the sprints and the two
mile, and especially in the 100. A

sweep l»y (lie stron,? JV sprinters,
led, by Keith Brownsberger, is
very possible.
In the field events, Cal's Bill
Dowd and Stanford's Phil Brabyn
J will it out in the shot, Dowd
j and Bub Rhodes will fight it out
in the discus, John Bugge Jr.
I should have the javelin, and Jan
j Mclndoe will fight it out with Cal's
j Clint King in the pole vault.
Cal has fair hurdlers and broad
jumpers, and a pair of good
jumpers, but top performances by
footballer John Steinberg in the
hurdles, George Zaninovich and
John Crowder in the high jump,
and Jim Ssebold in the broad jump
can take them.
Cal's relay team should romp
home first, but if all goes well,
the JV's should come home with
j (he meet by at least 20 points.



KEY MEN—Next Saturday's Big Meet in the Stanford Stadium
figures to be one of the closest in history. Stanford's great pair
of distance aces Bob Simon (above left) and Bob Reed (above
righi) must sweep the mile and two mile. An even more key
figure in the Card attack is Maury Parsons, left. Parsons will
churn the 100 and 220 against the Bears' dusky pair of sprint
stars, Guy Blackburn and Fred George. The three could finish
in any order. Other news from the track front is gloomy. Leo
Long, Stanford's sophomore javelin slinger has pulled up with
an injured ankle and probably won't compete Saturday.

The Braves are favored to take
the meet, but some come-through
performances will be needed. Russ
Ferguson in the mile will have to
fight off Cal's Frans Doleman for
top honors. Both boys usually do
the four laps in the high 4:; Jo's.
The 440 shapes up to be a close
duel between Stanford's Walt Gar
rett and Cal's Ait. Stewart. Both
are capable of 50 fiat, but Walt has
a slight edge on past performances.
Cal's Ed Hersh should cross the
tape first in the two-lapper with
a season best of J:. r »B.!J for Cal's
only sure first place.
Ihe junior Bears are extremely
weak in the sprints and the two
mile, and especially in the 100. A

sweep l»y (lie stron,? JV sprinters,
led, by Keith Brownsberger, is
very possible.
In the field events, Cal's Bill
Dowd and Stanford's Phil Brabyn
J will it out in the shot, Dowd
j and Bub Rhodes will fight it out
in the discus, John Bugge Jr.
I should have the javelin, and Jan
j Mclndoe will fight it out with Cal's
j Clint King in the pole vault.
Cal has fair hurdlers and broad
jumpers, and a pair of good
jumpers, but top performances by
footballer John Steinberg in the
hurdles, George Zaninovich and
John Crowder in the high jump,
and Jim Ssebold in the broad jump
can take them.
Cal's relay team should romp
home first, but if all goes well,
the JV's should come home with

KEY MEN—Next Saturday's Big Meet in the Stanford Stadium
figures to be one of the closest in history. Stanford's great pair
of distance aces Bob Simon (above left) and Bob Reed (above
righi) must sweep the mile and two mile. An even more key
figure in the Card attack is Maury Parsons, left. Parsons will
churn the 100 and 220 against the Bears' dusky pair of sprint
stars, Guy Blackburn and Fred George. The three could finish
in any order. Other news from the track front is gloomy. Leo
Long, Stanford's sophomore javelin slinger has pulled up with
an injured ankle and probably won't compete Saturday.

While mo°t track enthusiasts are
filing into the huge Stanford Sta
dium for the Big Meet this Satur
day, a hustling batch of youngsters
known as the Stanford Braves will
match times with the equally young
hustlers from the combined Cal
Blues and GoJd.s in the junior var
sity "topper" of the season.
Tilt* meet will start at 12:110
and promises to be as hotly mu
te, ted as the varsity affair that is
run with it. California, over Hoo
ded with atletes as usual, has two
junior vavsitv teams, the Blues
and Golds. They will combine
their talents to try and defeat the
potent Braves, beaten only once
this year, and that by Sacramento
in tiie (flopped baton incident.
