# Ted Williams And Coleman Exit Hitting
## 
### 
NEW YORK, April 30 (UP)â€”Ted
Williams hit a game-winning home
run in his last at-bat for the Red
Sox and Gerry Coleman hammered
a triple in his final appearance at
the plate for the Yankees today as
the two stars offered their fans a
farewell salute before going on ac
tive duty in the Marine Air Corps.
Williams, responding to the occas
sion in true Ruthian style, belted a
two-run homer in the seventh in
ning off Dizzy Trout to dissolve a
3-3 tie and give the Red Sox a 5-3
victory over the Tigers. Then, true
to the end to his own peculiar code
of conduct on the field, he trotted
casually around the bases refusing
to tip his cap to the thunderous
ovation which the crowd of 24,764
at Fenway Park accorded him.
Coleman, like Williams a Marine
fighter pilot, sent a towering drive
over center-fielder Jim Rivera's
head for a triple and scored a mo
ment later on a single by Mickey
Mantle when he made his final ap
pearance at bat in the seventh in
ning of the second game of a double
header with the Browns.
The Browns won the first game,
9-4, as Bob Cain won his third game
and Vic Raschi lost his first, but the
Yankees rebounded behind Allie
Reynolds' eight-strikeout, four-hit
pitching to win the nightcap, 4-1.
Coleman hammered out two hits in
each game and "finished his season"
with a .405 batting average.
