# Court Reversal Complicates Steel Situation
## 
### HADLEY ROFF Daily Political Editor 
Tuesday's District Court opin
ion that Truman's seizure of the
steel industry was unconstitu
tional was reversed yesterday
when the nine-man Court of Ap
peals reversed the lower court
decision and clamped down the
seizure order.
Yesterday morning a strike was
declared by the CIO Steel workers'
Union, and a war-vital industry ap
peared crippled.
Bui in a 5-4 split the Court of
Appeal:; decided that the"court
made no showing whatsoever which
would justify this court in staying
Judge (David A.) Pine's order."
Philip Murray, president of the

CIO, was of the opinion that. Pine':
order would not be immediately re
versed. Yesterday lie ordered the
(550,000 steel workers o/T the joh.
Today Murray will ofTer "no
comment" on the surprising deci
sion as his men return to the mills.
In the decision Tuesday, Pine said
that the seizure was "illegal and
without authority of law."
The judge said, "I believe lhnt
the contemplated strike if it came,
with all its awful results, would
be less Injurious to the public
than the injury which would How
from a timorous judicial recogni
tion that there is some basis for
this claim to unlimited and unre
strained executive power."
Thus Pine outlawed the govern
ment grab of steel and turned the
clock back to April !), the date set
by the CIO Steelworkers' Union for
a strike.
To prevent the April 9 walkout,
Truman, in a blistering speech to
the nation the day before, ordered

j the .' cizure of the steel indie try.
j Truman explained:
"Our national security and our
j chances for peace depend on our
I defense pro uct'on. Our defense
production depends on steel. . . .
1 he plain ffict is . . . the steel in
dustry has never been so profitable
(as it is today . . . and yet . . . the
steel companie s are now saying they
must have a price increase of $12 a
ton. . . . You may think thi; steel
dispute (is) ju-1 a matter between
the government r.nd a few greedy
companies. But it isn't. If we
granted the outrageous prices the
steel industry wants, we would
scuttle our whole price control pro
gram."
Truman's rcizure followed the
I breakdown of almo t four months
of negotiations between union and
management undtv the mediating
eye uf I be government's Wage
Stabilization Board.
Truman turned the wage dispute
j over to the WSB on Dec;. 22.

Though the union had slated a
strike for Jan. 1, Union Boss Philip
Murray agreed to postpone a walk
out, pending a decision by the
Board.
On March 20 the WSB recom
mended pay raises—l2l2 cents dat
ed back to Jan. 1, with 2M»-cent
raises next July and Jan. 1. The
Board also okayed the union ship.
The union readily agreed to the
recommendations, but set a strike
date for April 9 if management
didn't come through.
And management didn't come
through.
Plant operators blasted back
March 22, claiming that such rec
ommendations were impossible
and couldn't he met unless a cor
responding increase of $12 a ton
was permitted by government.
Truman said no. Management
thumbed its nose at the WSB, and
the union prepared for strike.
Truman further asserted that the
steel workers had not received a
wage adjustment in 16 months and
that they were being paid less than
workers in other major industries.

But management remained apa
thetic, and the strike was called,
and Truman stepped in.
However, Judge Pine shoved
Truman aside, telling the President
to take a long look at the Consti
tution .
Government attorneys, dur'ng
the 20 - day hearing beginning
April 9, argued that the President
had acted on emergency powers.
The government contended that
"interruption of steel manufac
ture for even a brief period would
st iously endanger the well-being
and safety of the United States in
a critical situation."
To support Truman's action, the
attorneys claimed the President
'has inherent power in such a sit
uation to take possession of the
steel companies." They argued fur
ther that "the courts are without
power to negate executive action of
the Presidency by enjoining it."
Pine found that the President
no "inherent power" than
that granted "expressly and impli
edly by the Constitution."
The judge continued, "There is
no express grant of power in the
Constitution authorizing the Pres
ident to direct this seizure. Thc.e
is 110 grant of power from which
it reasonably can he implied.
There is no enactment of Con
gress authorizing it."
Of the suggested emergency, Pine
said, "I believe that our procedures
under the Constitution can stand
the stress and strains of an emer
gency today as they have in the
past."
Replying to the government's
challenge of the court's light to
review administrative action, Pine
declared that ". . . officers of the
executive branch of the govern
ment may be enioincd when their
conduct is unauthorized by stat
ute."
Pine, in a sweeping decision, thus
knocked the props from under the
government's demand for unre
stricted power during a time of
emergency.
Summing up, Pine asserted, "To
my mind this (Truman's seizure)
spells a form of government alien
to our constitutional government
of limited powers. I therefore
find that the acts of the defend
ants arc illegal and without au
thority in law."
The decision was the first time
that a federal court had made a
ruling against an administrative
act of the President. Pine's ruling
will be carried to the Supreme
Court where the case will again be
argued.
