### 
DENVER, April 30 (UP)--A few
motorists made scattered rushes to
refill their gasoline tanks today as
striking oil unions reported they
were "a little closer" in wage nego
tiations with a small per cent of
the nation's oil industry.
Thousands of oil workers walked
off the job in refineries over much
of the nation early today in sup
port of the 22 unions' demands for
a 25 - cent - an - hour wage increase
plus higher differentials.
Weary union, management, and
government representatives sat
flown together again for plant-by
plant negotiations and indications
were that some progress had been
made at the end of the first day of
the strike.
In California, state conciliators
said the afternoon session with the
Shell Oil Co. ran into "unexpected
developments" caused by the na
tional strike situation which dimmed
earlier bright hopes for settlement.
