# 'Billy Budd" Termed Compelling Theater
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
"Billy Budd" is a theatrical work which Broadway critics, so
often accused of breaking plays, couldn't make. Unqualified ciiti
cal acclaim fell on an inexplicably deaf public ear, and the Louis
Coxe Robert Chapman dramatization of Herman Melville's novel
closed after a desperate run last season of 13 short weeks.
The Stanford Players' production of "Billy Budd," which opened

last evening at Memorial Audito
rium, proves the critics right and
the public wrong. Blending drama
on both the physical and the intel
lectual levels, the play emerges as
compelling theater, intelligently
conceived and skillfully fashioned.
Its setting is an English man-of
war during 1798 (the year follow
ing naval mutinies at Spithcad and
the More). The story tells of Billy
Bucld, a naive young sailor im
pressed off the merchant ship
"Rights of Man"' for duty aboard
H.M.S. "Indomitable"—and of the
events which lead to his unjust and
tragic death. On this foundation is
built an allegory which deals with
the battle between Good and Evil,
Nature and Authority, Emotion an !
Reason.
Billy, the Beautiful Boy, repre
sents trusting Good, while Claggnrt
embodies Evil. Ft is the latter'- in
trinsic hatred which leads him
falsely to accuse Billy of plotting a
revolt and it Is Billy's violated in
nocence which causes him to strike
and inadvertently kill Claggart.
Tried for mutiny, Billy falls victim
to Authority, even though Nature
demands his release.
In the hands of the Stanford
Players. "Billy Budd" finds a pro
duction by-and-large worthy of it
self. The first act, while well exe
cuted, lacks fire, but thereafter the
performers hit their stride and a
gripping intensity is quickly de
veloped. Even in the long and talky
trial scene, this i- pel I, thanks large
ly to some superb acting by David
Kaplan as Captain Vcrc and Ear!
Jones as Seymour, is unbroken.
Portraying Claggart, Ross Dur
fee in his earlier scenes is perhaps
too reminiscent of a foppish dandy
in the court of Louis XVI, but lie
soon modifies his behavior. Edwin
Williams is a superlative Billy
Budd, always likeable but never
saccharine.

Portraying Claggart, Ross Dur

too reminiscent of a foppish dandy

Williams is a superlative Billy

saccharine.

"Billy Budd" is a theatrical work which Broadway critics, so
often accused of breaking plays, couldn't make. Unqualified ciiti
cal acclaim fell on an inexplicably deaf public ear, and the Louis
Coxe Robert Chapman dramatization of Herman Melville's novel
closed after a desperate run last season of 13 short weeks.
The Stanford Players' production of "Billy Budd," which opened

last evening at Memorial Audito
rium, proves the critics right and
the public wrong. Blending drama
on both the physical and the intel
lectual levels, the play emerges as
compelling theater, intelligently
conceived and skillfully fashioned.
Its setting is an English man-of
war during 1798 (the year follow
ing naval mutinies at Spithcad and
the More). The story tells of Billy
Bucld, a naive young sailor im
pressed off the merchant ship
"Rights of Man"' for duty aboard
H.M.S. "Indomitable"—and of the
events which lead to his unjust and
tragic death. On this foundation is
built an allegory which deals with
the battle between Good and Evil,
Nature and Authority, Emotion an !
Reason.
Billy, the Beautiful Boy, repre
sents trusting Good, while Claggnrt
embodies Evil. Ft is the latter'- in
trinsic hatred which leads him
falsely to accuse Billy of plotting a
revolt and it Is Billy's violated in
nocence which causes him to strike
and inadvertently kill Claggart.
Tried for mutiny, Billy falls victim
to Authority, even though Nature
demands his release.
In the hands of the Stanford
Players. "Billy Budd" finds a pro
duction by-and-large worthy of it
self. The first act, while well exe
cuted, lacks fire, but thereafter the
performers hit their stride and a
gripping intensity is quickly de
veloped. Even in the long and talky
trial scene, this i- pel I, thanks large
ly to some superb acting by David
