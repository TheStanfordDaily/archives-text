# Council Defines Rule's "Spirit, Letter"
## 
### 
(Kdilor's note: The following is a rrpl.v from
Women's Council to a letter whirl) criticized the
Council's action in a rcccnt suspension case ;»nd
requested clarification of the Connril's stand on the
Fundamental Standard.)
Tlic Fundamental Standard statement on suspen
sion appearing in Wednesday's Daily was a routine
case report and should not he interpreted as a reply
to the open letter to Women's Council.
As the elected student judiciary, Women's Council
considers its purpose twofold: educative and judicial.
Council supervises the education of all women stu
dents in the Fundamental Standard and Hie Women's
Social Regulations. When through carelessness or
disregard a woman violates the Fundamental Stand
ard or the Social Regulations, Council assumes its
judicial role.
Women's Council is elected to uphold the spirit and
letter of Women's Social Regulations. The essence
of the spirit is the Fundamental Standard which em
bodies the qualities of honesty and integrity. Die
principle of the Fundamental Standard is found in
the ASSU Constitution and Social Regulations Rook:
"Students arc expected to show both within and
without the University such respect for order,
morality, personal honor, and the rights of others
as is demanded of good citizens. Failure to do this
will he sufficient cause for removal from the Uni
versity."
In judging a Fundamental Standard violation the
objective criteria considered arc 1) severity of viola
tion. 2) facts of the case, and 3) the testimony of the
individual in question. The intent of the act is de
termined from the facts of the case and testimony
of the individual. Our funciton is not to consider the

ultimate purpose of an act (i.e. motive), but the
action, and the intent at the time of action.
Each case is individually considered. Severity of
I Hp penalty is determined by the seriousness of the
objective criteria above. There are several penalties
open to Women's Council under the present system.
Among these penalties is the power to recommend
suspension. Actual suspension is carried out by the
University. Suspension is not automatic. This year,
Council has given both suspension and non-suspen
sion penalties for Fundamental Standard violations.
The decision of Council can be appealed to the Uni
versity Administ ration.
It is Council's policy to Keep the facts of Funda
mental Standard cases confidential in order to pro
pyl the individual involved. However, since some
of the facts have been published, we wish to enu
merate the facts which formed the basis of our
judgment. The girl returned t<i her residence after
closing hours and signed in her late leave slip. She
then asked if she could sign (.'it on an overnight.
She was told that she could sign nut. but she would
have to assume the penally for signing out after
hours.
The girl felt that she was 100 near the social pro
bation level to assume the penally and stated she
would tcmain in her residence. However, she had
already arranged to spend the night with a girl friend.
She could have notified a Resident Assistant or Coun
cil Representative of her situation or could have used
the pay phone to call her hostess. Instead, she de
cided to leave her residence without signing out, be
lieving, as she stated later that she would not be
discovered.
Women's Council realizes that suspension is a

serious penalty li» apply. llinvi'v!, we lecl "i;«i
under the present system, suspension was justified
in tltis rutso, hecaose willful intent In deceive Wits
established I y admission of Hie student. Al any
lime « it-evaluation of the penally system may lie
made by Hie students.
In this case Hip girl exercised her privilege of ap
pealing Council's decision through I In- University
Administration to Dr. Sterling. The University up
held Council's decision hy suspending her. Willi
liberal privilege:', such as we enjoy under the present
demerit system, comes increased responsibility. When
a student registers al Stanford il is assumed thai she
will learn, remember, understand, and accept the
Fundamental Standard.
We hope that this letter has clarified tlm fads of
this ease and the principles on which we hased our
judgment. We commend your interest il i lliroiigh

She could have notified a Resident Assistant or Coun

Council supervises the education of all women stu

judicial role.
Women's Council is elected to uphold the spirit and

of the spirit is the Fundamental Standard which em

principle of the Fundamental Standard is found in

"Students arc expected to show both within and

morality, personal honor, and the rights of others
as is demanded of good citizens. Failure to do this
will he sufficient cause for removal from the Uni

In judging a Fundamental Standard violation the

(Kdilor's note: The following is a rrpl.v from
Women's Council to a letter whirl) criticized the
Council's action in a rcccnt suspension case ;»nd
requested clarification of the Connril's stand on the
Fundamental Standard.)
Tlic Fundamental Standard statement on suspen
sion appearing in Wednesday's Daily was a routine
case report and should not he interpreted as a reply
to the open letter to Women's Council.
As the elected student judiciary, Women's Council
considers its purpose twofold: educative and judicial.
Council supervises the education of all women stu
dents in the Fundamental Standard and Hie Women's
Social Regulations. When through carelessness or
disregard a woman violates the Fundamental Stand
ard or the Social Regulations, Council assumes its
judicial role.
Women's Council is elected to uphold the spirit and
letter of Women's Social Regulations. The essence
of the spirit is the Fundamental Standard which em
bodies the qualities of honesty and integrity. Die
principle of the Fundamental Standard is found in
the ASSU Constitution and Social Regulations Rook:
"Students arc expected to show both within and
without the University such respect for order,
morality, personal honor, and the rights of others
as is demanded of good citizens. Failure to do this
will he sufficient cause for removal from the Uni
versity."
In judging a Fundamental Standard violation the
objective criteria considered arc 1) severity of viola
tion. 2) facts of the case, and 3) the testimony of the
individual in question. The intent of the act is de
termined from the facts of the case and testimony
of the individual. Our funciton is not to consider the

ultimate purpose of an act (i.e. motive), but the
action, and the intent at the time of action.
Each case is individually considered. Severity of
I Hp penalty is determined by the seriousness of the
objective criteria above. There are several penalties
open to Women's Council under the present system.
Among these penalties is the power to recommend
suspension. Actual suspension is carried out by the
University. Suspension is not automatic. This year,
Council has given both suspension and non-suspen
sion penalties for Fundamental Standard violations.
The decision of Council can be appealed to the Uni
versity Administ ration.
It is Council's policy to Keep the facts of Funda
mental Standard cases confidential in order to pro
pyl the individual involved. However, since some
of the facts have been published, we wish to enu
merate the facts which formed the basis of our
judgment. The girl returned t<i her residence after
closing hours and signed in her late leave slip. She
then asked if she could sign (.'it on an overnight.
She was told that she could sign nut. but she would
have to assume the penally for signing out after
hours.
The girl felt that she was 100 near the social pro
bation level to assume the penally and stated she
would tcmain in her residence. However, she had
already arranged to spend the night with a girl friend.
She could have notified a Resident Assistant or Coun
cil Representative of her situation or could have used
the pay phone to call her hostess. Instead, she de
cided to leave her residence without signing out, be
lieving, as she stated later that she would not be
discovered.
Women's Council realizes that suspension is a

serious penalty li» apply. llinvi'v!, we lecl "i;«i
under the present system, suspension was justified
in tltis rutso, hecaose willful intent In deceive Wits
established I y admission of Hie student. Al any
lime « it-evaluation of the penally system may lie
made by Hie students.
In this case Hip girl exercised her privilege of ap
pealing Council's decision through I In- University
Administration to Dr. Sterling. The University up
held Council's decision hy suspending her. Willi
liberal privilege:', such as we enjoy under the present
demerit system, comes increased responsibility. When
a student registers al Stanford il is assumed thai she
will learn, remember, understand, and accept the
Fundamental Standard.
We hope that this letter has clarified tlm fads of
this ease and the principles on which we hased our
judgment. We commend your interest il i lliroiigh
constructive discussion that the Fundamental Stand
ard and student government becomes meaningful to
us all.
