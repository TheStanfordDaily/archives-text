Fach one of us, as citizens and members of society
at large, brings lo Stanford a spirit of honor, personal
freedom, and integrity, which at Stanford is called
the Fundamental Standard. The ultimate purpose of
the Fundamental Standard is lo assure that Stanford
storients have the proper qualifications for being good
citizens.
Consequently, upon each student falls the individ
ual responsibility of respecting University regulations,
• hr- riuhts of others, and present moral and social
customs.
In its role in the daily life of every Stanford student,
the Stanford demands thai our individual conduct
exemplify (lie ideals and spirit of the Stanford Family.
Thus, a violation of the Standard is a violation of
the l ights of every Stanford student, in that it is the
student.-; who institute, execute, judge, and enforce
Ihe regulations and policies by which they define their
Fundamental Standard. As a spirit of honesty, the
Fundamental Standard covers all women's social reg
ulation . 'Ihe Standard is not defined in black and
white terms, since it i.s impossible to presuppose all
instances of dishonesty in social regulations.
Nol only must we meet the demands of the Uni
versity, hut we must meet those of society, which
now recognizes a "double standard" for men and
women.
'Ilie Committee welcomes further discussion and
correspondence.
