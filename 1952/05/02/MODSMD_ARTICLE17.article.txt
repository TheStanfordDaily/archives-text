Simon, look like sure one-tvvoers
in thr mile and two tnilc 'Ihey
will alternate at winning with
Sinmu faking Ihe mile and Reed
[ the longer laps,
Mathias, one of the top few col
legiate twirlers, will pace team
mates Chuck Henfro and lan Reed
in the discus. In the shot put, the
husky pair of Howie Hertz and
Chuck llokanson will battle for top
pi i/,e. Last week they both hit per
sonal bests in the high 52's.
Don Timmerman and Lou Spin
rier, sensational soph, lead a good
crop of Bear middle distanccmen
Last week Spurrier ran 1:,>4 wilh
out being pressed and the Card's
j captain Johnny Woolley ran a
brilliant 1:515.4 behind Ovy's John
Barnes. This could he Ihe finest
j race of Ihe day.
The hurdles shape up to ho a pet
sonal dual between Mathias and
Sieve Turner. Bob has the best time
in the highs, while Steve has clipped
the low barriers in :23.7. Bob hasn't
j run that fast this year, but is ccr
| tainly capable of it.
Once again, the jumping events
i could be the deciders with a lot of
1 men there or thereabouts. Lor tlio
I Indians Nas Fishhack looks like a
| good be! in the high jump and
Pelc McKay should place in the
J broad jump. Turner may be a stn
prise entrant in jumping pit.
The relay should be an easy win
for the Bear foursome which owns
(he best time on the Coast, wrappinc
nfT a 3:17.2 against UCLA. So fa ,
Coach Weiershauser has not been
able to mould together a very fast
crew. But he has won a few time •
when opponents dropped batons and
other freak accidents.
