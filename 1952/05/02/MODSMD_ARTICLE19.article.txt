# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Tlio recent election campaign witnessed more cam
pus William Jennings Bryans sticking their noses in
dining rooms than at any other time in the history
of LSJU. It got so that a guy couldn't fork a chili
bean without having some candidate barrel in, whip
off his name, state hi.s platform, throw in a few em
bellishments, and then bow out on some catchy slogan.

Many gave a specific platform,
such as being against sin and for
the American mother. And many
stressed, "Now be sure to vote on
Wednesday. I don't care who you
vote for, as long as you vote. The
important thing is to vote, under
stand?"
Here are a few composite hypo
thetical candidates v/ho walked
into the place where about 40
other guys and myself break

bread.
The first guy was a cheerleader hopeful. He startled
1 lie assemblage by taking a 20 foot leap into the room,
just as everyone had stuffed their mouths with
mashed potatoes.
"Okiy, gang, it's the BIG spell! Ready, hit it!!"
"Mmmmffffff, slurp, mmmffff."
"Oh, I see you're still all eating. Well, it's rather
difficult to yell when you have food in your mouth
isn't it? Ha. ha. Well, all I really wanted you to
do was to vote for me. Remember, my name is
l.lddas Seolis, which spelled backwards is Saddle
Shoes."
No sooner had Elddas Seohs hounded out of the
room when a demure, cow-eyed girl minced in.
"Well," she began simply enough, "I've got a cold,
so if my voice is a little squeaky, you'll have to for
give me."
Everyone smiled kind of a sickly smile and waited

for her to go on.
She didn't go on.
She had forgot her speech. She stood there a
minute, cleared her throat uncomfortably, retreated
to the door, and recovered enough to say, "Remem
ber, vote for me. My name is Gretchen."
The next candidate was kind of an overbearing
fellow.
"Okay, you guys, drop those forks. I've got some
thing to tell you, see. Now, first, I'll tell you a joke.
A campaign speech is something like a steer. A point
here, a point there, and a lot of bull in between. Get
it, a lot of bull in between. Ha, ha, ha!"
Stan, sitting next to me, started to give up his din
ner, but two of us pushed him under the table so
he wouldn't offend the candidate.
"Now, my name is . . ."
"Hey, pass the milk." This was shouted by Herb,
sitting across from me, to Dave, who was sitting 2(1
people down.
The candidate continued, "And I'm running for the
office of . . ."
"There's no milk left," yelled Dave. "This is that
orange stuff!"
"And I certainly would appreciate it if when you
vote . . ."
"Okay, pass the orange stuff, then," boomed Herb.
"Furthermore, if elected, I will endeavor to . . ."
"Where's that seconds on the potatoes?" K<on
shouted to a hasher. Ken plays football, and his 22(1
pounds require a lot of nourishment.
"You've had thirds already," retorted the hasher.
The candidate, still going strong, finished by saying,
"Remember, you can't miss my name. It's the eighth
one down in the field of 13." He smiled the candi
date's type of smile, and left.
Out of the window, three more politicians appeared
on the horizon.
"Lock the damn doors," screamed Stan.

"Now, my name is . . ."
"Hey, pass the milk." This was shouted by Herb,
sitting across from me, to Dave, who was sitting 2(1
people down.
The candidate continued, "And I'm running for the
office of . . ."
"There's no milk left," yelled Dave. "This is that
orange stuff!"
"And I certainly would appreciate it if when you
vote . . ."
"Okay, pass the orange stuff, then," boomed Herb.
"Furthermore, if elected, I will endeavor to . . ."
"Where's that seconds on the potatoes?" K<on
shouted to a hasher. Ken plays football, and his 22(1
pounds require a lot of nourishment.
"You've had thirds already," retorted the hasher.
The candidate, still going strong, finished by saying,
"Remember, you can't miss my name. It's the eighth
one down in the field of 13." He smiled the candi
date's type of smile, and left.
Out of the window, three more politicians appeared
on the horizon.
"Lock the damn doors," screamed Stan.

Tlio recent election campaign witnessed more cam
pus William Jennings Bryans sticking their noses in
dining rooms than at any other time in the history
of LSJU. It got so that a guy couldn't fork a chili
bean without having some candidate barrel in, whip
off his name, state hi.s platform, throw in a few em
bellishments, and then bow out on some catchy slogan.

Many gave a specific platform,
such as being against sin and for
the American mother. And many
stressed, "Now be sure to vote on
Wednesday. I don't care who you
vote for, as long as you vote. The
important thing is to vote, under
stand?"
Here are a few composite hypo
thetical candidates v/ho walked
into the place where about 40
other guys and myself break

bread.
The first guy was a cheerleader hopeful. He startled
1 lie assemblage by taking a 20 foot leap into the room,
just as everyone had stuffed their mouths with
mashed potatoes.
"Okiy, gang, it's the BIG spell! Ready, hit it!!"
"Mmmmffffff, slurp, mmmffff."
"Oh, I see you're still all eating. Well, it's rather
difficult to yell when you have food in your mouth
isn't it? Ha. ha. Well, all I really wanted you to
do was to vote for me. Remember, my name is
l.lddas Seolis, which spelled backwards is Saddle
Shoes."
No sooner had Elddas Seohs hounded out of the
room when a demure, cow-eyed girl minced in.
"Well," she began simply enough, "I've got a cold,
so if my voice is a little squeaky, you'll have to for
give me."
Everyone smiled kind of a sickly smile and waited

for her to go on.
She didn't go on.
She had forgot her speech. She stood there a
minute, cleared her throat uncomfortably, retreated
to the door, and recovered enough to say, "Remem
ber, vote for me. My name is Gretchen."
The next candidate was kind of an overbearing
fellow.
"Okay, you guys, drop those forks. I've got some
thing to tell you, see. Now, first, I'll tell you a joke.
A campaign speech is something like a steer. A point
here, a point there, and a lot of bull in between. Get
it, a lot of bull in between. Ha, ha, ha!"
Stan, sitting next to me, started to give up his din
ner, but two of us pushed him under the table so
he wouldn't offend the candidate.
