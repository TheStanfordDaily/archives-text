## Robeson: 'An Avowed Enemy' 
### 
To the Editorial Board:
I don't believe that in this world it is possible to
separate things such as "art" and "politics" into little
air tight compartments. These things are compounded
together into a complex pattern in our lives. There
fore, I do not believe that a man can be considered
merely on the basis of his art and at the same time
ignore the man as a whole.
As a resident of San Francisco, I heartily endorse
Mayor Robinson's recommendation and the conse
quent banning of Paul Robeson from singing at the
Memorial Opera House. The Mayor made his recom
mendation on the basis that this Opera House is a
memorial, in a sense a shrine dedicated to those who
have died for the principles that uphold our country.
Robeson is avowedly opposed to those principles.
That we should prevent him from making a mockery
of (he dedication of this building is not "emotional
ism," it is good sense. For his are not "political be
liefs" hut criminal assertions. No amount of talent,
practice, or art can purify these ideals and make them
anything but what they are.
He is a man, a man who opposes my country. He
is an enemy. Should I be tolerant of such a man
because he can sing? Should I support him? No. I
will oppose him and those like him to the best of my
ability at all times.
"Tolerance" has become a god in our thinking. It
has become sinful to be intolerant of anything. I am
intolerant of many things, and I am proud of it.
Among those things that I am intolerant of, is the
principle: any means to an end. And I will oppose
the man who supports this principle in the street,
in my home, and in public buildings and opera houses.
I will deny that he has a right to depend on the
■ upporl of the people he is so willing to betray. I
will deny his right to use a memorial to that, which
he opposes, whether to make a living or to contribute
to the culture of the community. I will deny that I
should be tolerant of what he would like to (hi to me,
my friends and family, and my country, for art's sake.
Ai't is not that important. Not as important as my
security and very life.
The Communists may use anything they like for
propaganda. This is no basis for our action. Do you
mean to say that we should not do what is right
because a liar is going to tell lies about it? The Com
munists tell lies and misconstrue everything and any
thing in any case no matter how virtuous the actions
may be. Just because they may say we are banning
Robeson because he is a Negro does not make it so.

The Communist propagandists "make capital" out
of anything they please. We cannot be primarily con
cerned with that. We cannot be concerned with what
will or will not give them opportunities to lie. If we
do, we must fall. We are in an even greater degree
being controlled by them and what they believe. For,
in a sense, we must act according to their dictates if
we concern ourselves with their lies.
It is true that the banning of Robeson is an act
of "Intolerance," and an act of ill will, and I cannot
think of a more just target than the supporter of evil
in our society. For if his wish that we be subjugated
under the Soviet is not evil, what is? For those con
siderations I cannot stir up much pity for the poor
"music lover" who will miss hearing him.
I am proud of my city, and I am proud of my
Mayor.
