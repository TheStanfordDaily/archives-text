# More on Robeson
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Our educational system is divine, and anyone who
dares criticize it is blasphemous. Paul Robeson cer
tainly has his nerve to censure it! Why anyone knows
that in some states a Negro has a chance to become
literate; while in others a few Negro students ac
tually are admitted to the state universities.
They might have granted him permission to sing
with the reservation that he use only the songs from
a list compiled by them in their magnificent wisdom;
or they could have made a list of "verboten" songs
(headed, needless to say by "The Internationale").
If Mr. Robeson finds a hall, I am going to hear
him—only to observe the frantic behavior of the San
Francisco longshoremen. I might like it, nevertheless,
if they give him a chance to sing between their
frenzied outbursts. I hear he is rather good.
Hoping that some day we all may be as grandly and
gloriously educated as the San Francisco Opera House
Board I am,
Yours sincerely,
