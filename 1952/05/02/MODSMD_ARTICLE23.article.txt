# Dining Hall Letter 'Blow Below the Belt'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
A letter in reply to that of Messrs. Berardinelli,
Irwin, Stevenson, and Handmaker:
As Sponsors and Resident Assistants at Encina Hall
we are writing this letter in defense of our dining
hall. For the purpose of brevity, we take exception
to only a few of the comments made in yesterday's
letter. In the first place the "reputable" source was
a disgruntled chef, who has just recently been fired
because of excessive drinking and excessive "helping
himself" to food supplies. We doubt that he can be
considered a reputable source.
Secondly, it is unwise to state figures without a
full explanation of their meaning. Yesterday's letter
states (hat only of our food dollar goes toward
the actual buying of food. If the writers of that
letter had taken the effort to consult the owner of
any restaurant or fountain-grill they would have
found that if such an establishment were to spend
55£ out of every dollar on raw food, they would be
bankrupt in a very short while.
Thirdly, comment was made that "we" have to get
up in the middle of the night in order to get a decent
breakfast. We do not profess to know the hours at
which law students have their classes, but on. behalf

of the 532 of us at Encina, over one-half of whom
have 8:00 o'clock classes, we do not feel that 7:00 to
7:30 is quite the middle of the night. For the benefit
of those writers of yesterday's letter, it might, be well
to state that only a few of the 24 fraternities on cam
pus serve a late breakfast, which is served at Encina
from 8:00 until 8:30.
In the last place, the point to which we take the
strongest exception is the alleged lack of interest of
certain dining hall directors for the concern and
service to the students. For the past year, we have
been asking the Director of the Encina Dining Hall
for many favors which she was under no obligation
to provide. Among these were meals at special
hours for students participating in campus activities,
meals prepared and boxed to be served at other
locations than the dining hall and the use of dining
hall facilities for such things as study halls and
meetings. In all cases, we have met with only the
sincerest co-operation.
In closing, we feel that yesterday's letter did not
represent the feeling of t/he majority and was on the
whole, "a blow below the belt."

A letter in reply to that of Messrs. Berardinelli,
Irwin, Stevenson, and Handmaker:
As Sponsors and Resident Assistants at Encina Hall
we are writing this letter in defense of our dining
hall. For the purpose of brevity, we take exception
to only a few of the comments made in yesterday's
letter. In the first place the "reputable" source was
a disgruntled chef, who has just recently been fired
because of excessive drinking and excessive "helping
himself" to food supplies. We doubt that he can be
considered a reputable source.
Secondly, it is unwise to state figures without a
full explanation of their meaning. Yesterday's letter
states (hat only of our food dollar goes toward
the actual buying of food. If the writers of that
letter had taken the effort to consult the owner of
any restaurant or fountain-grill they would have
found that if such an establishment were to spend
55£ out of every dollar on raw food, they would be
bankrupt in a very short while.
Thirdly, comment was made that "we" have to get
up in the middle of the night in order to get a decent
breakfast. We do not profess to know the hours at
which law students have their classes, but on. behalf

of the 532 of us at Encina, over one-half of whom
have 8:00 o'clock classes, we do not feel that 7:00 to
7:30 is quite the middle of the night. For the benefit
of those writers of yesterday's letter, it might, be well
to state that only a few of the 24 fraternities on cam
pus serve a late breakfast, which is served at Encina
from 8:00 until 8:30.
In the last place, the point to which we take the
strongest exception is the alleged lack of interest of
certain dining hall directors for the concern and
service to the students. For the past year, we have
been asking the Director of the Encina Dining Hall
for many favors which she was under no obligation
to provide. Among these were meals at special
hours for students participating in campus activities,
meals prepared and boxed to be served at other
locations than the dining hall and the use of dining
hall facilities for such things as study halls and
meetings. In all cases, we have met with only the
sincerest co-operation.
In closing, we feel that yesterday's letter did not
represent the feeling of t/he majority and was on the
whole, "a blow below the belt."
