# Deferment Opportunities Of ROTC Units Explained
## 
### 
(Editor's note: The following is the third in a series of four articles
outlining the current military situation to Stanford nun. I( is based
on information obtained from the ROTC ottices.)
There are opportunities in all three of Stanford's ROTC units
for men with advanced academic standing to gain deferment for
the balance of their college career.
Of the three branches, the Army unit probably offers oppor
tunity to the most men. Any student properly enrolled in the

University can sign up for the two
year basic course.
After the basic course is com
pleted, the student can qualify
for the advanced course by hav
ing a C average for his overall
academic career, by passing the
reserve officers' physical exam,
and by signing a contract requir
ing a period of service as a sec
ond lieutenant. This period in
cludes a minimum of two years
of active duty at the discretion of
the Secretary of the Army and a
total of eight years on active re
serve duty.
This is the same term of service
demanded of draftees.
After the first quarter of basic
training, the ROTC office is given
a quota of students to whom it can
grant I-D deferments. These defer
ments are good as long as the stu
dents are enrolled in the unit.
Once enrolled in advanced RO, a
student is deferred until graduation.
In the advanced course a man re
ceives 90 cents per diem subsistence
in addition to having his books fur
nished. He attends one six-week
summer camp between his junior
and senior years.
Regarding opportunities for stu
dents with advanced standing, some
examples will show how such men
may fit in the ROTC program.
Engineers who need five years to
graduate could join after their
freshman year, or they could attend
their fifth year on leave from the
service.
Pre - med students in the RO
who are accepted into Med School
at the end of their senior year are
granted leave by the Army to
attend school. After their gradu
ation from Med School, they will
go on active duty for their intern
ship and contract period of serv
ice, as first lieutenants.
The Air Force ROTC differs only
slightly from the Army.
The con tract'period of service, the
summer camp, subsistence allow
ance, and division of course into
basic and advanced programs par
allel the Army program.
In the matter of deferment
quotas, however, there is some
difference. Whereas the Army
quota for deferring basic students
this year covered virtually all its
cadets, (he Air Force was only
able to grant deferments to about
75 per cent of its cadets.
Also, there is a quota restriction
which limits the number of men
going into the advanced course in
addition to the limits placed by the
physical exam.
Opportunities are also available
for advanced study while on leave
from active duty, if such study can
be utilized by the Air Force.
The Naval ROTC program, the
most exacting in its requirements
for acceptance, probably offers
the greatest rewards of any of

the three services.
Advanced students are acceptable
if qualified; but all things being
equal, preference will be given to
entering freshmen.
There are two methods of enter
ing the NROTC —as a regular or
contract student. The regular stu
dents are selected on the basis of
a nationwide competitive test given
during November or December of
the year preceding their acceptance,
high school records, and personal
interviews.
They receive tuition, books, and a
retainer pay of $600 per year. Each
of the three summers of their col
lege career they serve on a six
week cruise.
Contract students are screened
by the local ROTC office and are
accepted or reieted on the basis
of local applications. The num
ber of openings on contract status
is a quota which depends on the
si/.e of the local unit and the
number of regulars assigned to it.
For 1951-52 the quota for enter
ing students was 70 men.
Both contract and regular stu
dents have to pass a Navy line offi
cers' physical, but the contract stu
dents serve on only one summer
cruise.
The other big difference in the
Navy program is that upon accept
ance all men are granted I-D de
ferments which are continued until
the men. are commissioned or are
dropped from the program.
For further information on all
the ROTC units, students may
contact the respective headquar
ters in the BAC.
There are also several organized
reserve units in the Palo Alto and
San Jose area, but from the stand
point of deferment there is little
point in discussing their opportuni
ties.
In short, any man who has en
listed in a reserve unit subsequent
to February 1, 1951, does not qual
ify for an I-D deferment.
Tomorrow: Seniors' opportunities
for commissions.

for advanced study while on leave
from active duty, if such study can
be utilized by the Air Force.
The Naval ROTC program, the
most exacting in its requirements
for acceptance, probably offers
the greatest rewards of any of

the three services.
Advanced students are acceptable
if qualified; but all things being
equal, preference will be given to
entering freshmen.
There are two methods of enter
ing the NROTC —as a regular or
contract student. The regular stu
dents are selected on the basis of
a nationwide competitive test given
during November or December of
the year preceding their acceptance,
high school records, and personal
interviews.
They receive tuition, books, and a
retainer pay of $600 per year. Each
of the three summers of their col
lege career they serve on a six
week cruise.
Contract students are screened
by the local ROTC office and are
accepted or reieted on the basis
of local applications. The num
ber of openings on contract status
is a quota which depends on the
si/.e of the local unit and the
number of regulars assigned to it.
For 1951-52 the quota for enter
ing students was 70 men.
Both contract and regular stu
dents have to pass a Navy line offi
cers' physical, but the contract stu
dents serve on only one summer
cruise.
The other big difference in the
Navy program is that upon accept
ance all men are granted I-D de
ferments which are continued until
the men. are commissioned or are
dropped from the program.
For further information on all
the ROTC units, students may
contact the respective headquar
ters in the BAC.
There are also several organized
reserve units in the Palo Alto and
San Jose area, but from the stand
point of deferment there is little
point in discussing their opportuni
ties.
In short, any man who has en
listed in a reserve unit subsequent
to February 1, 1951, does not qual
ify for an I-D deferment.

for commissions.

There are opportunities in all three of Stanford's ROTC units
for men with advanced academic standing to gain deferment for
the balance of their college career.
Of the three branches, the Army unit probably offers oppor
tunity to the most men. Any student properly enrolled in the

University can sign up for the two
year basic course.
After the basic course is com
pleted, the student can qualify
for the advanced course by hav
ing a C average for his overall
academic career, by passing the
reserve officers' physical exam,
and by signing a contract requir
ing a period of service as a sec
ond lieutenant. This period in
cludes a minimum of two years
of active duty at the discretion of
the Secretary of the Army and a
total of eight years on active re
serve duty.
This is the same term of service
demanded of draftees.
After the first quarter of basic
training, the ROTC office is given
a quota of students to whom it can
grant I-D deferments. These defer
ments are good as long as the stu
dents are enrolled in the unit.
Once enrolled in advanced RO, a
student is deferred until graduation.
In the advanced course a man re
ceives 90 cents per diem subsistence
in addition to having his books fur
nished. He attends one six-week
summer camp between his junior
and senior years.
Regarding opportunities for stu
dents with advanced standing, some
examples will show how such men
may fit in the ROTC program.
Engineers who need five years to
graduate could join after their
freshman year, or they could attend
their fifth year on leave from the
service.
Pre - med students in the RO
who are accepted into Med School
at the end of their senior year are
granted leave by the Army to
attend school. After their gradu
ation from Med School, they will
go on active duty for their intern
ship and contract period of serv
ice, as first lieutenants.
The Air Force ROTC differs only
slightly from the Army.
The con tract'period of service, the
summer camp, subsistence allow
ance, and division of course into
basic and advanced programs par
allel the Army program.
In the matter of deferment
quotas, however, there is some
difference. Whereas the Army
quota for deferring basic students
this year covered virtually all its
cadets, (he Air Force was only
able to grant deferments to about
75 per cent of its cadets.
Also, there is a quota restriction
which limits the number of men
going into the advanced course in
addition to the limits placed by the
physical exam.

ing a period of service as a sec
ond lieutenant. This period in
cludes a minimum of two years
of active duty at the discretion of
the Secretary of the Army and a
total of eight years on active re
serve duty.
This is the same term of service
demanded of draftees.
After the first quarter of basic
training, the ROTC office is given
a quota of students to whom it can
grant I-D deferments. These defer
ments are good as long as the stu
dents are enrolled in the unit.
Once enrolled in advanced RO, a
student is deferred until graduation.
In the advanced course a man re
ceives 90 cents per diem subsistence
in addition to having his books fur
nished. He attends one six-week
summer camp between his junior
and senior years.
Regarding opportunities for stu
dents with advanced standing, some
examples will show how such men
may fit in the ROTC program.
Engineers who need five years to
graduate could join after their
freshman year, or they could attend
their fifth year on leave from the
service.
Pre - med students in the RO
who are accepted into Med School
at the end of their senior year are
granted leave by the Army to
attend school. After their gradu
ation from Med School, they will
go on active duty for their intern
ship and contract period of serv
ice, as first lieutenants.
The Air Force ROTC differs only
slightly from the Army.
The con tract'period of service, the
summer camp, subsistence allow
ance, and division of course into
basic and advanced programs par
allel the Army program.
In the matter of deferment
quotas, however, there is some
difference. Whereas the Army
quota for deferring basic students
this year covered virtually all its
cadets, (he Air Force was only
able to grant deferments to about
75 per cent of its cadets.
Also, there is a quota restriction
which limits the number of men
going into the advanced course in
addition to the limits placed by the
physical exam.
Opportunities are also available
for advanced study while on leave
from active duty, if such study can
be utilized by the Air Force.
The Naval ROTC program, the
most exacting in its requirements
for acceptance, probably offers
the greatest rewards of any of

the three services.
Advanced students are acceptable
if qualified; but all things being
equal, preference will be given to
entering freshmen.
There are two methods of enter
ing the NROTC —as a regular or
contract student. The regular stu
dents are selected on the basis of
a nationwide competitive test given
during November or December of
the year preceding their acceptance,
high school records, and personal
interviews.
They receive tuition, books, and a
retainer pay of $600 per year. Each
of the three summers of their col
lege career they serve on a six
week cruise.
Contract students are screened
by the local ROTC office and are
accepted or reieted on the basis
of local applications. The num
ber of openings on contract status
is a quota which depends on the
si/.e of the local unit and the
number of regulars assigned to it.
For 1951-52 the quota for enter
ing students was 70 men.
Both contract and regular stu
dents have to pass a Navy line offi
cers' physical, but the contract stu
dents serve on only one summer
cruise.
The other big difference in the
Navy program is that upon accept
ance all men are granted I-D de
ferments which are continued until
the men. are commissioned or are
dropped from the program.
For further information on all
the ROTC units, students may
contact the respective headquar
ters in the BAC.
There are also several organized
reserve units in the Palo Alto and
San Jose area, but from the stand
point of deferment there is little
point in discussing their opportuni
ties.
In short, any man who has en
listed in a reserve unit subsequent
to February 1, 1951, does not qual
ify for an I-D deferment.
Tomorrow: Seniors' opportunities
for commissions.
(Editor's note: The following is the third in a series of four articles
outlining the current military situation to Stanford nun. I( is based

There are opportunities in all three of Stanford's ROTC units
for men with advanced academic standing to gain deferment for
the balance of their college career.
Of the three branches, the Army unit probably offers oppor
tunity to the most men. Any student properly enrolled in the

University can sign up for the two
year basic course.
After the basic course is com
pleted, the student can qualify
for the advanced course by hav
ing a C average for his overall
academic career, by passing the
reserve officers' physical exam,
and by signing a contract requir
ing a period of service as a sec
ond lieutenant. This period in
cludes a minimum of two years
of active duty at the discretion of
the Secretary of the Army and a
