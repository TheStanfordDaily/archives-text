# Injuns Battle UCLA, Cal In CIBA Weekend Crucials
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
With everything to gain and just as much to lose, Stanford's
title-aspiring baseballers tie into UCLA this afternoon and Cal to
morrow. Both games begin at 3:15 p.m. in the Sunken Diamond.
The Indians have staged a marvelous comeback campaign.
Several weeks ago they were in the clutches of the league cellar

with a one won, four lost record.
Since then, Everett Dean's men have
captured four tilts in a row in CiBA
competition and are in second place
behind USC.
Pitching had been the number one
headache until the resurge. How
ever, Joe Chez, the Goodies eater,
started the win streak by hurling
a one-hitter against (JSC. Chez fol
lowed that with a triumph over
Santa Clara, and then Bob Murphy
winged another one hitter against
the Broncs. Phil Page and Mike
Acker combined to squeak past the
Broncs a third time.
Bruins Today
This afternoon, the Farm team
meets its nemisis, UCLA. 'Hie Bruins
have inflicted three of Stanford's
foUr losses, and this will be the last
meeting between the two squads.
The Westwooders have a five and five
record and are only a hall game be
hind the Deanmen.
Toeing the rubber for the visitors
will be Bob IVlacNeil, who lias al

ready decisioned Stanford once and
who has a two won, three lost record.
Pitching opposition will be provided
by the undefeated Chez.
On Saturday, approximately at the
time the Cal track meet ends, the
Indians will try to defeat Cal for the
second time. Lanky Ed Mayer will
probably throw things at Stanford
batsmen while Bob Murphy, a pitch

er with a lot of "stuff," is scheduled
to throw things at Cal batters.
Abrahamson Returns
Three injured Stanford baseballers
are healthy now, or at least partly
so, and will return to CIBA action
over the weekend. Co-captain Art
Abrahamson, second baseman, is able
to run on his bad knee and will prob
ably start one ol the games.
Coach Everett Dean had this to
pay of freshman Dick Scramaglia,
who has subbed for Abrahamson,
"Rich deserves a lot of credit for
filling in lor Art. He has played most
of the games with a weak ankle and
a charley horse. Rich is a fine pros
pect."
Fans who take in the two games
will get a chance to see Essegian try
for the left field fence again.
Twenty-three homers have been hit
in the history of the Sunken Dia
mond. The well-muscled poker-face
from Los Angeles has collected eight
of them.
