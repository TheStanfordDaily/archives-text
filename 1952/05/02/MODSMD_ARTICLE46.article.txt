## Spurs Knowledge Of American Life 
### BARBARA TUERK 
In a small, neat officc overlooking the Cellar, filled willi filing
cabinets and maps, resides Stanford's foreign Scholarship Com
mittee, recently cited by the Freedom's Foundation for its con
tributions to the spread of knowledge about the American way
of life.
As stated in their new by-laws, the Committee's purpose i:; to

"further world understanding by
promoting the exchange of ideas
among college students."
Under the leadership of Dick
Weismann and Phil Saeta, this
year's co-chairmen, the committee
lias worked to integrate the seven
ASSU Foreign Scholars into living
joups and campus life, to publicize
their activities, and to acquaint
them with the United States.
Specific projects for the schol
ars have included complete prc
rcg orientation from the grade
point \vstem to women's social
regulations, the planning of
speaking engagements, seminars,
and industrial, civic, and educa
tional tours, and arrangements for
their appearance on radio and TV.
One of the committee's largest
tesks has been the selection, with
living group aid. of the eight For
eign Scholars for next year. More
than 400 applications from almost
every country in the world were
reviewed this winter.
The Foreign Scholarship Pro
gram was started in April, I!MX,
by a referendum of the student
body. Since then Stanford has
welcomed 28 foreign scholars who
have lived in almost every fiving
group on campus.
The Stanford program differs
from similar projects in several
ways. First of all, it is student
conceived and stm'ent-riin.
Secondly, our scholars arc closely
integrated into campus life. The
Foreign Scholarship Committee is
one of the few groups on campus to
have a permanent evaluation staff,
working all through the years with
living groups and scholars to find
ways to better this integration.
In the third place, the Stanford
program involves a reciprocal ex
change. This year former Farm
students Phil Nielsen and Floyd St.
Clair arc studying at the Free Uni
versity of Berlin and the Institute
of Political Science in Paris.
Their tuition is being financed by
these schools just as Stanford is
financing the ASSU Scholars.
Organizationally, the Foreign
Scholarship Committee was initi
ated as a sub-committee of the
ASSU Excom. This year its $5,000
budget was the largest of any
Fx corn committee.
Under the new by-laws now be
ing discussed by Excom, the com
mittee will be raised to the status
of an administrative board.
To carry out their ptaiccls the
committee works with almost ev
ery office in Inner Quad, as well
as with I he ASSU. the lilt, the
Institute of International Educa
tion. national and local scrvice
groups, foreign governments, the
State Department, and manv trav
el groups. This year alone the
committee has mailed out more
than 1,100 letters.
