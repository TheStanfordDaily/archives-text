Mouths fell open and eyes popped
j out yesterday morning at Lathrop
; House when the girls name down
to breakfast to find their hall and
Ismail living room furniture missing
! and no silverware to eat with.
Part of the mystery was solved
' when one of the girls discovered the
i furniture — consisting of tables,
lamps, chairs, and couches — ar
ranged neatly on the front lawn.
The silverware was not to be found.
Then another girl's eyes rose to
meet the sight of all the Lathrop
House toilet seats stretched across
the street on a rope between two
trees. Even the third - floor seats
were there. Three of them were
broken by the police who took
tbem down.
At 5 p.m. the house received an
anonymous phone call telling them
that one drawer of their silverware
was in President Sterling's garage.
The knives and forks had been
wrapped carefully in toilet paper to
prevent rattling.
As yet no one in Lathrop knows
who could have broken into their
locked house. The job was prob
ably done between 4 and 5 a.m.
