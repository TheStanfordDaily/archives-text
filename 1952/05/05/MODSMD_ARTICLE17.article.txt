DENVER, May 4 (UP)—The na- j
tionwide oil workers strike that
i threatens to cut supplies to 8,500.000
| mid western residents hit private and
; commercial flying today.
In Washington, the government |
issued a rationing order to become
effective at 3:01 a.m. (EDT) May G.
It restricts domestic airlines to 65 j
I per cent of the aviation gasoline they j
used during March for the next 28 j
days.
The order is expected to cut sup
plies to some 70 per cent of the gaso-
I line that would normally be used
during that 28-day period. It also
will ban all pleasure and sport flying
and prohibit export of aviation gaso
! line without governmental pcrmis- j
sion.
Foreign airlines will be limited to '
B5 per cent of the gasoline they pur- !
chased in this country during March.

rationing, said the airlines must de
cide for themselves how to trim their
j schedules.
Government officials would not I
j comment on the possibility of gon- |
! cral rationing of motor fuel to all |
j consumers. Brown said only that he
presumed the "shortages would I
! spread if the strike lasts long'
I enough." j
