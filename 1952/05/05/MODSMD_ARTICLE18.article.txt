tion is the challenge to think," was
the opinion voiced by Dr. Sterling

Alumni Assembly in Memorial Au

Speaking before some of the 2,000

until World War II world leadership
was lacking because United States
thinking was concerned with inter
nal, not world problems.

to produce leaders through harder
work, not in terms of more hours
or units, but "cerebration." He also
advocated more research and the
application of the scientific method
to social sciences.

the opinion voiced by Dr. Sterling

Alumni Assembly in Memorial Au
ditorium Saturday morning.
Speaking before some of the 2,000

was lacking because United States
thinking was concerned with inter
nal, not world problems.
