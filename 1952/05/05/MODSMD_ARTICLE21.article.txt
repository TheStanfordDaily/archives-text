# Tracksters Beat Bears To Cop Big Meet 70-61
## 
### DICK KLEIN Daily Sports Edtior 
It was 808 M ATI HAS DAY
Saturday as the Stanford thin
clads outscorcd and outfought
their big rivals from California
to win the Big Meet, 70 to 61.
There were many heroes and
come-throughs, but the many
alums and 8,000-or-so spectators
who sat in on the 57th Big One
are still sighing to high heaven
about Tulare Bob. And they
should be.
As a matter of record, it was
Coach Jack Wciersha user's fourth
straight victory over the Bears. It
also added to the total win bulge
the Cards have over Cal.
Three First I'iaccs
Back to the Mathias performance.
Showing that he has fully recovered
from any aches in his left thigh,
Bob clicked off three vital firsts,
an amazing third, and all sorts of
good times and marks. As was ex
pected, he won the discus and the
120-yard high hurdles.
The high sticks came fourth on
the varsity running program and at
a time when the wind had suffi
ciently died down for some real
serious efforts. All Bob did was
zoom over the barriers in : 14.11 for
his all-time best and one of the top
times in the country.
Bob was expectcd to give the
platter-tossing record a good .scare,
but fell a little more than three
feet short of Pete Zagar's 1939 dis
cus mark of 164 ft. s '/2 in. His other
first came in the low hurdles and
was a complete surprise.
Needed Second Place
The crowd knew that Bob had to
take a sccond place to cinch th«;
meet and make complete the all
victorious day for the Indians.
Down the chute came the competi
tors. Mathias and Turner came over
each hurdle in unison until the
fourth barrier.
Looking down the runway, the
tense partisan crowd only saw one
pair of legs glide over, as Mathias
bad grabbed the lead. He poured it
on and maintained the lead untd the
race to the tape when he let up a
little with victory and the meet as
sured. The time against the gale
like wind was :24.9.
Declined to Vault
Bob cleared 13 ft., good for a third,
in the pole vault with a sensatioarl
lift, but then declined to go fui -
ther.
In the shot put, which saw every
leading competitor get oft terrific
tosses, Bob was third with a heavn
of 50 ft. 2'A in. until Cal's Sam
Adams got off his best-ever.
Hertz Tosses 53 Feet
Howie Hertz, 258-pound transfer,
grabbed some of the spotlight with
an outstanding day in the shot put
ring. He managed three puts over
the 53-foot mark, winning with a
heave of 53 ft. B'/i in.
Another outstanding come
through was registered by Leo
Long. Entering the javelin with a
badly sprained ankle, the Card
sophomore unnerved his Cal com
petitors with a winning throw of
211 ft. 3% in.
Simon, Reed Win
Bob Simon and Bob Reed won teh
mile and two-mile as expected. The
times were not too outstanding, as
the wind took heavy toll in theso
longer events. In the lung-bursting
two - mile there were two sweet
surprises, first was the fine show
ing of Will King, who nearly did th--
impossible to beat Reed. He f"!l
just inches short of it. The other
was a clean sweep for Stanford,
something completely new in the
distance.

It was 808 M ATI HAS DAY
Saturday as the Stanford thin
clads outscorcd and outfought
their big rivals from California
to win the Big Meet, 70 to 61.
There were many heroes and
come-throughs, but the many
alums and 8,000-or-so spectators
who sat in on the 57th Big One
are still sighing to high heaven
about Tulare Bob. And they
should be.
As a matter of record, it was
Coach Jack Wciersha user's fourth
straight victory over the Bears. It
also added to the total win bulge
the Cards have over Cal.
Three First I'iaccs
Back to the Mathias performance.
Showing that he has fully recovered
from any aches in his left thigh,
Bob clicked off three vital firsts,
an amazing third, and all sorts of
good times and marks. As was ex
pected, he won the discus and the
120-yard high hurdles.
The high sticks came fourth on
the varsity running program and at
a time when the wind had suffi
ciently died down for some real
serious efforts. All Bob did was
zoom over the barriers in : 14.11 for
his all-time best and one of the top
times in the country.
Bob was expectcd to give the
platter-tossing record a good .scare,
but fell a little more than three
feet short of Pete Zagar's 1939 dis
cus mark of 164 ft. s '/2 in. His other
first came in the low hurdles and
was a complete surprise.
Needed Second Place
The crowd knew that Bob had to
take a sccond place to cinch th«;
meet and make complete the all
victorious day for the Indians.
Down the chute came the competi
tors. Mathias and Turner came over
each hurdle in unison until the
fourth barrier.
Looking down the runway, the
tense partisan crowd only saw one
pair of legs glide over, as Mathias
bad grabbed the lead. He poured it
on and maintained the lead untd the
race to the tape when he let up a
little with victory and the meet as
sured. The time against the gale
like wind was :24.9.
Declined to Vault
Bob cleared 13 ft., good for a third,
in the pole vault with a sensatioarl
lift, but then declined to go fui -
ther.
In the shot put, which saw every
leading competitor get oft terrific
tosses, Bob was third with a heavn
of 50 ft. 2'A in. until Cal's Sam
Adams got off his best-ever.
Hertz Tosses 53 Feet
Howie Hertz, 258-pound transfer,
grabbed some of the spotlight with
an outstanding day in the shot put
ring. He managed three puts over
the 53-foot mark, winning with a
heave of 53 ft. B'/i in.
Another outstanding come
through was registered by Leo
Long. Entering the javelin with a
badly sprained ankle, the Card
sophomore unnerved his Cal com
petitors with a winning throw of
211 ft. 3% in.
Simon, Reed Win
Bob Simon and Bob Reed won teh
mile and two-mile as expected. The
times were not too outstanding, as
the wind took heavy toll in theso
longer events. In the lung-bursting
two - mile there were two sweet
surprises, first was the fine show
ing of Will King, who nearly did th--
impossible to beat Reed. He f"!l
just inches short of it. The other
was a clean sweep for Stanford,
something completely new in the
distance.
A complete summary of the meet:

Simpson (C); 3, R. Reed. Time—
4:18.

tors. Mathias and Turner came over
each hurdle in unison until the
fourth barrier.
Looking down the runway, the
tense partisan crowd only saw one
pair of legs glide over, as Mathias
bad grabbed the lead. He poured it
on and maintained the lead untd the
race to the tape when he let up a
little with victory and the meet as
sured. The time against the gale
like wind was :24.9.
Declined to Vault
Bob cleared 13 ft., good for a third,
in the pole vault with a sensatioarl
lift, but then declined to go fui -
ther.
In the shot put, which saw every
leading competitor get oft terrific
tosses, Bob was third with a heavn
of 50 ft. 2'A in. until Cal's Sam
Adams got off his best-ever.
Hertz Tosses 53 Feet
Howie Hertz, 258-pound transfer,
grabbed some of the spotlight with
an outstanding day in the shot put
ring. He managed three puts over
the 53-foot mark, winning with a
heave of 53 ft. B'/i in.
Another outstanding come
through was registered by Leo
Long. Entering the javelin with a
badly sprained ankle, the Card
sophomore unnerved his Cal com
petitors with a winning throw of
211 ft. 3% in.
Simon, Reed Win
Bob Simon and Bob Reed won teh
mile and two-mile as expected. The
times were not too outstanding, as
the wind took heavy toll in theso
longer events. In the lung-bursting
two - mile there were two sweet
surprises, first was the fine show
ing of Will King, who nearly did th--
impossible to beat Reed. He f"!l
just inches short of it. The other
was a clean sweep for Stanford,
something completely new in the
distance.

It was 808 M ATI HAS DAY
Saturday as the Stanford thin
clads outscorcd and outfought
their big rivals from California
to win the Big Meet, 70 to 61.
There were many heroes and
come-throughs, but the many
alums and 8,000-or-so spectators
who sat in on the 57th Big One
are still sighing to high heaven
about Tulare Bob. And they
should be.
As a matter of record, it was
Coach Jack Wciersha user's fourth
straight victory over the Bears. It
also added to the total win bulge
the Cards have over Cal.
Three First I'iaccs
Back to the Mathias performance.
Showing that he has fully recovered
from any aches in his left thigh,
Bob clicked off three vital firsts,
an amazing third, and all sorts of
good times and marks. As was ex
pected, he won the discus and the
120-yard high hurdles.
The high sticks came fourth on
the varsity running program and at
a time when the wind had suffi
ciently died down for some real
serious efforts. All Bob did was
zoom over the barriers in : 14.11 for
his all-time best and one of the top
times in the country.
Bob was expectcd to give the
platter-tossing record a good .scare,
but fell a little more than three
feet short of Pete Zagar's 1939 dis
cus mark of 164 ft. s '/2 in. His other
first came in the low hurdles and
was a complete surprise.
Needed Second Place
The crowd knew that Bob had to
take a sccond place to cinch th«;
meet and make complete the all
victorious day for the Indians.

bad grabbed the lead. He poured it
on and maintained the lead untd the
race to the tape when he let up a
little with victory and the meet as
sured. The time against the gale
like wind was :24.9.
Declined to Vault
Bob cleared 13 ft., good for a third,
in the pole vault with a sensatioarl
lift, but then declined to go fui -
ther.
In the shot put, which saw every
leading competitor get oft terrific
tosses, Bob was third with a heavn
of 50 ft. 2'A in. until Cal's Sam
Adams got off his best-ever.
Hertz Tosses 53 Feet
Howie Hertz, 258-pound transfer,
grabbed some of the spotlight with
an outstanding day in the shot put
ring. He managed three puts over
the 53-foot mark, winning with a
heave of 53 ft. B'/i in.
Another outstanding come
through was registered by Leo
Long. Entering the javelin with a
badly sprained ankle, the Card
sophomore unnerved his Cal com
petitors with a winning throw of
211 ft. 3% in.
Simon, Reed Win
Bob Simon and Bob Reed won teh
mile and two-mile as expected. The
times were not too outstanding, as
the wind took heavy toll in theso
longer events. In the lung-bursting
two - mile there were two sweet
surprises, first was the fine show
ing of Will King, who nearly did th--
impossible to beat Reed. He f"!l
just inches short of it. The other
was a clean sweep for Stanford,
something completely new in the
distance.

It was 808 M ATI HAS DAY
Saturday as the Stanford thin
clads outscorcd and outfought
their big rivals from California
to win the Big Meet, 70 to 61.
There were many heroes and
come-throughs, but the many
alums and 8,000-or-so spectators
who sat in on the 57th Big One
are still sighing to high heaven
about Tulare Bob. And they
should be.
As a matter of record, it was
Coach Jack Wciersha user's fourth
straight victory over the Bears. It
also added to the total win bulge
the Cards have over Cal.
Three First I'iaccs
Back to the Mathias performance.
Showing that he has fully recovered
from any aches in his left thigh,
Bob clicked off three vital firsts,
an amazing third, and all sorts of
good times and marks. As was ex
pected, he won the discus and the
120-yard high hurdles.
The high sticks came fourth on
the varsity running program and at
a time when the wind had suffi
ciently died down for some real
serious efforts. All Bob did was
zoom over the barriers in : 14.11 for
his all-time best and one of the top
times in the country.
Bob was expectcd to give the
platter-tossing record a good .scare,
but fell a little more than three
feet short of Pete Zagar's 1939 dis
cus mark of 164 ft. s '/2 in. His other
first came in the low hurdles and
was a complete surprise.
Needed Second Place
The crowd knew that Bob had to
take a sccond place to cinch th«;
meet and make complete the all
victorious day for the Indians.
Down the chute came the competi
tors. Mathias and Turner came over
each hurdle in unison until the
fourth barrier.
Looking down the runway, the
tense partisan crowd only saw one
pair of legs glide over, as Mathias
bad grabbed the lead. He poured it
on and maintained the lead untd the
race to the tape when he let up a
little with victory and the meet as
sured. The time against the gale
like wind was :24.9.
Declined to Vault
Bob cleared 13 ft., good for a third,
in the pole vault with a sensatioarl
lift, but then declined to go fui -
ther.
In the shot put, which saw every
leading competitor get oft terrific
tosses, Bob was third with a heavn
of 50 ft. 2'A in. until Cal's Sam
Adams got off his best-ever.
Hertz Tosses 53 Feet
Howie Hertz, 258-pound transfer,
grabbed some of the spotlight with
an outstanding day in the shot put
ring. He managed three puts over
the 53-foot mark, winning with a
heave of 53 ft. B'/i in.

through was registered by Leo

badly sprained ankle, the Card
sophomore unnerved his Cal com
petitors with a winning throw of
