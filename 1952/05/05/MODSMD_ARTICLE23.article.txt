# Old Floor at Daily Gives Way to New
## 
### 
The Daily Shack was literally
floored last week and then raised
to new heights.
The production of the campus'
own Dippy was temporarily inter
rupted Thursday and Friday when
carpenters from the Corporation
Yard invaded the shack to install
a new floor.
Termites or aging of the wood
was blamed for the wearing out
of the wood in the foyer and hall
of the shack. Large open spaces
had developed in the wood.
Before the Corporation Yard
workers arrived, minor accidents
had occurred because of the dilapi
dated floor. One photographer suf
fered bruised legs after tripping
into the large crevice, almost
dropping his camera.
Many valuable articles were
found in the holes, including
money, cigarettes, and a large
wood engraving.
Today, however, the Dailyitcs are
enjoying a new floor. It is the
new western-type raised variety,
giving new height to the small
peop'e who work as campus jour
nalists.
