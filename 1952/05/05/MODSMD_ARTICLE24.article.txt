# Faultless Funnies Here Wednesday
## 
### 
The annual (and now famous)
comic parody of the Chanpie will
appear this Wednesday. This year
in Faultless Funnies the Old Boy
promises us Moon Mellons, Hopa
long Cassidy, Steve Crevice, and
many others. There will also be a
parody of that well-known news
paper which you all read. All this
and more can be yours for the
small, Ismail price of only 30 cents.
