ProkofiefTs fantastic comic opera,
"The Love For Three Oranges,"
which has never been performed on
the West Coast, has been selected as
the annual opera to be presented by
the Stanford Players and the Music
Department May 29, 30. and 31.
Sandor Salgo will conduct the 70-
piece orchestra. Harold Schmidt has
trained the 40-voice chorus; and- O.
G. Brockett is designing the seven
acts required for this fairy-tale
opera, which tells the story of the
adventures of the Prince who goes
in search of the three magic oranges.
Virginia Opsvig is designing the cos
tumes, and the entire production is
under the direction of F. Cowles
Strickland.
In the past the annual Stanford
opera has attracted the largest audi
ence of the season. Both "Shwanda"
and "Peter Grimes" were so popular
that they were taken to the San
Francisco Opera House. While "The
Love For Three Oranges" is part of
the regular Stanford subscription
series, there are tickets available for
all three performances at the Me
morial Theatre box oflice.
