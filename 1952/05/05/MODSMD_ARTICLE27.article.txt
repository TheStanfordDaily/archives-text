# Interviews Still On for Cardinals
## 
### 
Cardinals interviews continue to
day and tomorrow from 1 to 4 p.m.
in the ASSU Excom room. Five
sophomores and five juniors are
needed to fill next year's 10-man
junior and senior activities board.
Cardinals work directly under
Excom in co-ordinating the campus'
traditional events such as Rip
Game, Homecoming, and Con Home
Week. Past experience is helpful.
I but willingness to work is the prime
I requisite, according to President
| Chuck Malouf.
