# Public Opinion's Role in the Steel Crisis
## 
### 
Harry Truman's virtual "ultimatum" Satur
day that the steel companies in the present
wage dispute give steel workers a wage hike
unless an agreement is reached "right now,"
and the Supreme Court's blocking of the order
adds extra complexity to an already tangled
dispute.
From a situation involving labor versus man
agement for a wage increase, the controversy
lias ramified into a series of issues: Has the
executive the constitutional right to seize an
industry under the pretext of emergency pow
ers? What are the powers and how binding are
the decisions of the Wage Stabilization Board?
Has the executive the right in an emergency to
determine the conditions of employment?
The man in the street, saying with the late
Will Rogers "All I know is what I read in the
papers," is pretty confused. He may argue that
the steel workers deserve the wage increase;
he may argue that the steel companies cannot
pay higher wages without raising steel prices
substantially. But he is probably arguing on
the basis of pre-conceived sympathies and
prejudices, pro-labor or pro-management.
He is faced with one set of facts, one set of
figures, one set of arguments against another.
Which set he should accept, if either, is a per
plexing problem. The conflict reflects the basic
failure of the bargaining powers to compro
mise.
Out of the confusing picture we can make
several definite observations ignoring the basic
dispute centering around the wage demands:
1. President Truman's actions, both in the
seizure and the wage-fixing ultimatum, if con
stitutional, stretch emergency powers to the
utmost, set potentially dangerous precedents,
and leave the definition cf emergency condi

tions vague. Truman has expanded the execu
tive's power further than ever before in peace
time. And if today's conditions are of an emer
gency nature, presidents can claim emergency
powers in a cold war or hot, inflation or de
pression, or when there is a foreign threat im
minent or potential.
2. The strike as a weapon in the current dis
pute is becoming increasingly unpopular. At
the same time labor is impotent without it. It
is unfortunate that the strike, which often bene
fits no one, must be labor's big weapon, imply
ing as the word does conflict, warfare—Big
Business versus Big Labor —that mediation and
negotiations have failed and the issues are be
yond peaceable settlement at the bargaining
table.
3. Public opinion may prove in the long run
the best mediator. Doubtless public sentiment
against a strike was a factor in Murray's de
cision to call off the strike following the Su
preme Court's order to leave the steel com
panies in temporary government operation.
Truman's call for a conference of CIO and steel
company leaders, at which he issued his wage
hike ultimatum probably influenced the de
cision also. At any rate, public sympathy right
now is against a strike, even among many who
are sympathetic with labor's demands.
If and when the facts of the current dispute
come to light, public opinion can exert pressure
toward a settlement. As is the case in most dis
putes, the answer in the steel controversy prob
ably lies somewhere in the middle. Both par
ties have been adamant, uncompromising.
Harry Truman cannot compel a compromise.
A strike might force a bitter, grudging settle
ment and at the same time disrupt the defense
economy. An enlightened public opinion could
speed compromize where all else has failed.

is unfortunate that the strike, which often bene
fits no one, must be labor's big weapon, imply
ing as the word does conflict, warfare—Big
Business versus Big Labor —that mediation and
negotiations have failed and the issues are be
yond peaceable settlement at the bargaining
table.
3. Public opinion may prove in the long run
the best mediator. Doubtless public sentiment
against a strike was a factor in Murray's de
cision to call off the strike following the Su
preme Court's order to leave the steel com
panies in temporary government operation.
Truman's call for a conference of CIO and steel
company leaders, at which he issued his wage
hike ultimatum probably influenced the de
cision also. At any rate, public sympathy right
now is against a strike, even among many who
are sympathetic with labor's demands.
If and when the facts of the current dispute
come to light, public opinion can exert pressure
toward a settlement. As is the case in most dis
putes, the answer in the steel controversy prob
ably lies somewhere in the middle. Both par
ties have been adamant, uncompromising.
Harry Truman cannot compel a compromise.
A strike might force a bitter, grudging settle
ment and at the same time disrupt the defense
economy. An enlightened public opinion could
speed compromize where all else has failed.
Harry Truman's virtual "ultimatum" Satur
day that the steel companies in the present
wage dispute give steel workers a wage hike
unless an agreement is reached "right now,"
and the Supreme Court's blocking of the order
adds extra complexity to an already tangled
dispute.
From a situation involving labor versus man
agement for a wage increase, the controversy
lias ramified into a series of issues: Has the
executive the constitutional right to seize an
industry under the pretext of emergency pow
ers? What are the powers and how binding are
the decisions of the Wage Stabilization Board?
Has the executive the right in an emergency to
determine the conditions of employment?
The man in the street, saying with the late
Will Rogers "All I know is what I read in the
papers," is pretty confused. He may argue that
the steel workers deserve the wage increase;
he may argue that the steel companies cannot
pay higher wages without raising steel prices
substantially. But he is probably arguing on
the basis of pre-conceived sympathies and
prejudices, pro-labor or pro-management.
He is faced with one set of facts, one set of
figures, one set of arguments against another.
Which set he should accept, if either, is a per
plexing problem. The conflict reflects the basic
failure of the bargaining powers to compro
mise.
Out of the confusing picture we can make
several definite observations ignoring the basic
dispute centering around the wage demands:
1. President Truman's actions, both in the
seizure and the wage-fixing ultimatum, if con
stitutional, stretch emergency powers to the
utmost, set potentially dangerous precedents,
and leave the definition cf emergency condi

tions vague. Truman has expanded the execu
tive's power further than ever before in peace
time. And if today's conditions are of an emer
gency nature, presidents can claim emergency
powers in a cold war or hot, inflation or de
pression, or when there is a foreign threat im
minent or potential.
2. The strike as a weapon in the current dis
pute is becoming increasingly unpopular. At
the same time labor is impotent without it. It
is unfortunate that the strike, which often bene
fits no one, must be labor's big weapon, imply
ing as the word does conflict, warfare—Big
