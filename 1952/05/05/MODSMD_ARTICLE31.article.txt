### DICK McLEAN 
It is (lie children above all who have a claim
lo sunlit spaces, clear skies and healing airs.
We are proud and glad to dedicate this build
ing to their welfare.
President Wilbur's address upon the dedi
cation of the Stanford Convalescent Home
Do you know what the Con Home is? Have you ever
been out there? I didn't and hadn't so I visited it one
day last week.
The Convalescent Home is a curious sight. Built on
the grounds of the original Stanford estate it is a
strange mixture of the past and the present, the old
and the young. Two winged serpents of cast iron still

guard the driveway and what re
mains of the Senator's house. In
the great earthquake of 1908 it,
as well as the Memorial Church,
was partially destroyed. But they
both rose anew.
Adjacent to that staunch old
house are the new buildings, long
and low with many windows and
wide sunny porches.
Within these buildings are
housed the patients, all children

from 4 to 12 years old. The purpose of'the Con Home
is to provide the facilities for a successful recupera
tive period to needy youngsters. The most common
affliction is a rheumatic heart. This ruthless malady
cannot be cured with a wonder drug or an operation.
The only panacca is sunlight and orange juice and
i;est and happiness..
In all of these does the Con Home excell, especially
the last. When you walk through the wards, you have
no feeling that this is a hospital. No antiseptic smell,
no hushed sterility. Instead you hear kids laughing,
being loud, and bickering as kids do. You see class
rooms, model airplane building, hobby shops.
Instead of the flat white walls that mark so many

rest homos there are murals for the children. Wollo,
now a famous puppeteer, did the drawing a lew
years back. Light switches become the tongues of
animals, a plain wall becomes a merry-go-round of
color and cartoons to delight youthful eyes for hours
on end. And the kids reflect this air of frivolity and
cheerfulness.
It was fun on the tour last Tuesday just looking
around and talking to kids. Most of them look sur
prisingly well with their tan faces and bright sun
suits. You forget sometimes —as they do — that
they're ill.
I sneaked off from the tour for a minute and ducked
into a classroom for "runabouts." The teacher was
very kind and let me wander.
One little girl explained that she was making a
chicken to lay eggs for the cardboard farm over in
the corner.
A Negro boy had so much to say that he ran all
his words together in a long string of, "Miss-Finch
is-going-to-bring-some-corn-seeds . . . and a we're
going to have a real garden . . . and a I'm going to
eat the corn."
They were just about to show a movie so I cramped
into one of the chairs in the back of the room. A boy
of about seven with bright eyes moved over and
stood beside me. He leaned toward my shoulder and
said in an earnest, knowing whisper, "we have movies
all the time. I wouldn't be afraid to ride a bucking
bronco. Have you ever rode a bucking bronco?"
I told him a fine big lie.
And when the afternoon was over, I knew a lot
more about the Con Home. It houses 80 kids. The
average time per patient is 8 months. At least a
dozen charities help support it. We, the Stanford
Student Body, contribute four beds at a cost of
$3,000.
All year round there are calls made on our generos
ity. It seems that everyone needs our time and dough.
But I can't help feeling alter last Tuesday that this
one -needs us most.
