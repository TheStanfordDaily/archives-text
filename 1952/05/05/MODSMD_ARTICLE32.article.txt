## 'Let's Deport Robeson!'

(Editor's note: Well, Stew, you challenged us
to print this, and By Gar you won! Regarding
Campus Opinion: challenge or no challenge, we
reserve the right to print letters or not as we
see tit. Letters should he short and to the point,
and while we place no inflexible word limit, we
may cut unnecessarily long letters at our dis
cretion. We would discourage replies to pre
vious letters to the editor unless they hear on
the central issue.)

To the Editor:
I would he extremely appreciative if the "Daily"
were to print the following letter as soon as is
possible, ft represents rather accurately the senti
ments of many Stanford students with whom I have
spoken recently. I feel that in the interest of your
avowed policy of "fairness," (see editorial comment
—pg. 2, The Stanford Daily, Thursday, April 17,
I!J!>2) this letter merits publication. If you will, I
consider it a direct challenge of the editorial philos
ophy presented in the mentioned edition.
I was disgusted with the editorial board of the
Stanford Daily. The editorial, which apparently was
the product of the entire editorial stafT of the "Daily,"
concerning Paul Kobeson and his scheduled appear
ance in the San Francisco War Memorial Opera House
next month was nauseating. It. lacked any use of
intelligence, patriotism, or common sense.
The time has come to stoy all this nonsensical

worry over what is going to bp good or bad propa
ganda. It is time for Americans to be Americans, and
to fight when we are attacked. If Paul Robeson were
to be permitted an appearance on the stage of the
San Francisco War Memorial Opera House, it would
be an utter disgrace! I cannot help but to disagree
with the theory that "art" and "politics" are separate
and cannot be considered one with the other.
Paul Roheson is an avowed Communist! He has
publicity declared that he would favor Russia in
a war against the United States. During his many
tours through Europe he has discredited the United
States and her democratic way of life, and while so
doing, spoke of what a great friend and benefactor
Russia is, of "all mankind." Why then, should we
permit an avowed enemy of the United States, and
the American way of life, to profit from that very
way of life which he so readily attacks? How can
we permit him to perform, and by so doing, give
him the opportunity to further spread his vicious
propaganda throughout the United States? What is
even more, how can we permit or even tolerate his
appearance in an edifice erected in memorial to
those who gave their lives defending that very faith
and belief which Mr. Robeson attacks at all op
portunities? I say we should, and can, not.
The Daily states that we are handing the Commu
nists material which they can use as propaganda
points — "Communist groups and sympathizers can
make capital out of racial discrimination, political

discrimination, or both, whether they are valid or
not." In regard to the racial issue—it is unfortunate
that Mr. Robeson is a Negro, however, in regard to
the making of a political issue—l would say that it.
is time that we do make political issue of Com
munism and all lei low travelers! Communists have
been "hiding behind backs" lor many years. It is
time they were brought into the open, and fought
openly.
The United States is presently involved in a war
with the Communists, or should the Stanford men
presently in Korea, and those 011 their way, prefer
to call it, "a police action against a Lunch of hand
its"? Can we "tolerate" those who are killing our
very comrades in Korea, and who have vowed to
conquer the world by means of force? This is what
the Daily asks of us. I think we "understand" the
Communists "just fine."
One can carry idealisms just so far. We can speak
in terms of "tolerance," "liberal spirit," etc. Frankly,
I'm tired of all such in dealing with our enemies—l
am ready to act! Let's deport Robeson! He should
be shot as a traitor, but, being American, I suggest
we just get rid of him. He loves Communists and
Russia so much—well then, let's let him live there—

he certainly claims to dislike the United States
enough! The whole situation reminds me of a favorite
story . . . The one concerning the man attacking
you with a gun. He runs out of bullets, and you
have some in your pocket. Do you give them to him,
or do you fight back yourself?

ophy presented in the mentioned edition.
I was disgusted with the editorial board of the
Stanford Daily. The editorial, which apparently was
the product of the entire editorial stafT of the "Daily,"
concerning Paul Kobeson and his scheduled appear
ance in the San Francisco War Memorial Opera House
next month was nauseating. It. lacked any use of
intelligence, patriotism, or common sense.
The time has come to stoy all this nonsensical

worry over what is going to bp good or bad propa
ganda. It is time for Americans to be Americans, and
to fight when we are attacked. If Paul Robeson were
to be permitted an appearance on the stage of the
San Francisco War Memorial Opera House, it would
be an utter disgrace! I cannot help but to disagree
with the theory that "art" and "politics" are separate
and cannot be considered one with the other.
Paul Roheson is an avowed Communist! He has
publicity declared that he would favor Russia in
a war against the United States. During his many
tours through Europe he has discredited the United
States and her democratic way of life, and while so
doing, spoke of what a great friend and benefactor
Russia is, of "all mankind." Why then, should we
permit an avowed enemy of the United States, and
the American way of life, to profit from that very
way of life which he so readily attacks? How can
we permit him to perform, and by so doing, give
him the opportunity to further spread his vicious
propaganda throughout the United States? What is
even more, how can we permit or even tolerate his
appearance in an edifice erected in memorial to
those who gave their lives defending that very faith
and belief which Mr. Robeson attacks at all op
portunities? I say we should, and can, not.
The Daily states that we are handing the Commu
nists material which they can use as propaganda
points — "Communist groups and sympathizers can
make capital out of racial discrimination, political

discrimination, or both, whether they are valid or
not." In regard to the racial issue—it is unfortunate
that Mr. Robeson is a Negro, however, in regard to
the making of a political issue—l would say that it.
is time that we do make political issue of Com
munism and all lei low travelers! Communists have
been "hiding behind backs" lor many years. It is
time they were brought into the open, and fought
openly.
The United States is presently involved in a war
with the Communists, or should the Stanford men
presently in Korea, and those 011 their way, prefer
to call it, "a police action against a Lunch of hand
its"? Can we "tolerate" those who are killing our
very comrades in Korea, and who have vowed to
conquer the world by means of force? This is what
the Daily asks of us. I think we "understand" the
Communists "just fine."
One can carry idealisms just so far. We can speak
in terms of "tolerance," "liberal spirit," etc. Frankly,
I'm tired of all such in dealing with our enemies—l
am ready to act! Let's deport Robeson! He should
be shot as a traitor, but, being American, I suggest
we just get rid of him. He loves Communists and
Russia so much—well then, let's let him live there—

he certainly claims to dislike the United States
enough! The whole situation reminds me of a favorite
story . . . The one concerning the man attacking
you with a gun. He runs out of bullets, and you
have some in your pocket. Do you give them to him,
or do you fight back yourself?

a war against the United States. During his many
tours through Europe he has discredited the United
States and her democratic way of life, and while so
doing, spoke of what a great friend and benefactor
Russia is, of "all mankind." Why then, should we
permit an avowed enemy of the United States, and
the American way of life, to profit from that very
way of life which he so readily attacks? How can
we permit him to perform, and by so doing, give
him the opportunity to further spread his vicious
propaganda throughout the United States? What is
even more, how can we permit or even tolerate his
appearance in an edifice erected in memorial to
those who gave their lives defending that very faith
and belief which Mr. Robeson attacks at all op
portunities? I say we should, and can, not.
The Daily states that we are handing the Commu
nists material which they can use as propaganda
points — "Communist groups and sympathizers can
make capital out of racial discrimination, political

discrimination, or both, whether they are valid or
not." In regard to the racial issue—it is unfortunate
that Mr. Robeson is a Negro, however, in regard to
the making of a political issue—l would say that it.
is time that we do make political issue of Com
munism and all lei low travelers! Communists have
been "hiding behind backs" lor many years. It is
time they were brought into the open, and fought
openly.
The United States is presently involved in a war
with the Communists, or should the Stanford men
presently in Korea, and those 011 their way, prefer
to call it, "a police action against a Lunch of hand
its"? Can we "tolerate" those who are killing our
very comrades in Korea, and who have vowed to
conquer the world by means of force? This is what
the Daily asks of us. I think we "understand" the
Communists "just fine."
One can carry idealisms just so far. We can speak
in terms of "tolerance," "liberal spirit," etc. Frankly,
I'm tired of all such in dealing with our enemies—l
am ready to act! Let's deport Robeson! He should
be shot as a traitor, but, being American, I suggest
we just get rid of him. He loves Communists and
Russia so much—well then, let's let him live there—

he certainly claims to dislike the United States
enough! The whole situation reminds me of a favorite
story . . . The one concerning the man attacking
you with a gun. He runs out of bullets, and you
have some in your pocket. Do you give them to him,
or do you fight back yourself?

To the Editor:
I would he extremely appreciative if the "Daily"
were to print the following letter as soon as is
possible, ft represents rather accurately the senti
ments of many Stanford students with whom I have
spoken recently. I feel that in the interest of your
avowed policy of "fairness," (see editorial comment
—pg. 2, The Stanford Daily, Thursday, April 17,
I!J!>2) this letter merits publication. If you will, I
consider it a direct challenge of the editorial philos
ophy presented in the mentioned edition.
I was disgusted with the editorial board of the
Stanford Daily. The editorial, which apparently was
the product of the entire editorial stafT of the "Daily,"
concerning Paul Kobeson and his scheduled appear
ance in the San Francisco War Memorial Opera House
next month was nauseating. It. lacked any use of
intelligence, patriotism, or common sense.
The time has come to stoy all this nonsensical

worry over what is going to bp good or bad propa
ganda. It is time for Americans to be Americans, and
to fight when we are attacked. If Paul Robeson were
to be permitted an appearance on the stage of the
San Francisco War Memorial Opera House, it would
be an utter disgrace! I cannot help but to disagree
with the theory that "art" and "politics" are separate
and cannot be considered one with the other.
Paul Roheson is an avowed Communist! He has
publicity declared that he would favor Russia in
