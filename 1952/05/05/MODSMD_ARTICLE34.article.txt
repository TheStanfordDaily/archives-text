# 'Cheers' for Discussion
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Three cheers for the Daily Editorial Staff for con
sidering the Robeson ban important enough to discuss
and for discussing it intelligently and maturely.
Mr. Kay's letter expresses the healthy, open-minded
attitude which is essential to the continuation of
individual freedom. Unlike Mr. Johnson, he did not
confuse issues nor speak condescendingly, as a nurse
to a precocious but erring child. Mr. lvays merely
remembers the distinction between a political meeting
and a concert and had enough courtesy to consider
those who wanted to go to hear the baritone sing.
His offer to respect the opinion of others in return
lor their respect is the basis of democratic society.
