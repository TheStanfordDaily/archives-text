# For a Survey on Dining Halls
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Agreed that the letter on Dining Halls by Berardi
nelli and others was in parts erroneous I would like
to point out the misleading character of the Encina
RA's and Sponsor's letter.
These men take their strongest exception to the
lack of service previously cited. Along this line I
would like to make some personal statements. When
I lived in Encina (1949-50) twelve other freshmen
and myself were members of an Air Force Reserve
unit which met on weekends in San Rafael. At this
time we sought permission to have our Sunday dinner
delayed a half hour (a thing that v/as being done for
the training table) as it was practically impossible to
get from Hamilton Field AFB, through San Francisco,
to Encina in an hour and a half. Our request was
granted once and then refused thereafter.
This same complaint has been voiced by many
other persons who had personal engagements for
which they had to leave campus a few minutes before
meal time. This is a great example of lack of service
to the student. These people do not expect a full meal
but would like something to take away that hungry
feeling. Granted they could stop somewhere and buy

something, but haven't they already paid for a cer
tain share of food at their dining hall?
Still another point, as mentioned by both letters,
is the breakfast situation. The men's dormitories
universally have an early breakfast (7 to 7:.'10) and
a snack breakfast from 8 to 8:30. At Stern, both
of these breakfasts are well-attended. liut why
couldn't there be some kind of breakfast between
7:.*50 and 8:00? For the man with an 8 o'clock a snack
at this time would be most handy.
In closing I take opposition to their statements re
garding the majority. Such a statement can only be
based on a survey. Has Encina made such a survey?
The Hygiene department made such a survey in Stern
Hall (I can give you the name of the man who con
sidered it) and the results are most interesting as
regards the opinions of the majority.
There is much room for improvements; for the sake
of the students I hope some are made. For this pur
pose I suggest a survey be made of Stern, Encina,
and Village dining halls by some responsible body,
and such a survey be submitted to the dining hall
directors. »
