# SRI Works With Atom
## 
### DAVE SEELEY 
Ever since the atomic bomb
was revealed in its breath-tak
ing power at Hiroshima, there
has been a need for research in
the industrial uses of the atom.
The newly developed radiation
engineering laboratory at the
Stanford Research Institute is
answering this demand.
Dr. J. E. Hobson, Director of the
Institute, has recently announced
thut SRI will soon boast of the larg
est radioactive source outside of an
Atomic Energy Commission instal
lation.
Even now the Institute has com
pleted arrangements for obtaining a

5,000-curie source of cobalt 60, a
gamma ray emitter, from Brook
haven National Laboratory. Emis
sions from a 5,000-curie source are
so powerfully penetrating that they
could be only partly duplicated by
about $100 million worth of radium.
The radioactive source anticipated
to be at the Institute's disposal will
be five times the power of any avail
able at the present time for indus
trial and medical research.
The radiation laboratory will be
completed and ready to begin opera
tion in the late spring. The safety
devices will be in order for maxi

mum efficient research so that large 1
amounts of radiation may be tested }
in a wide variety of possible in- j
dustrial applications. A special safety I
feature will be the underground ;
water-filled storage tank for the j
highly radioactive cobalt GO source. I
As already stated above, the main
purpose of this laboratory is to de
velop industrial uses for large
amounts cf radiation. Another pur
pose and one more beneficial to SHI
itself is that it will provide all re
search brunches of the Institute with
a staff and facilities to undertake
experimental work using radioiso
topes. Many difficult research prob
lems can be quickly and economic
ally solved by making use of the
radiations emitted from extremely j
small quantities, or tracers, of radio
isotopes.
