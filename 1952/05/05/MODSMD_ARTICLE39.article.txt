# BASEBALLERS TAKE 2; TIE FOR FIRST
## Cards Rally to Whip UCLA, 9 to 8, And Cal, 6 to 5, in Weekend Thrillers 
### PETE GROTHE 
WOW! No. double WOW! And, Mr. Printer, please put those WOW's in capital letters.
In a pair of games that were as inartistic as they were spectacular, Stanford's baseballors zipped
into a first-place tie with USC by nudging UCLA in 10 innings on Friday, 9 to 8, and then rallying
The double triumph gave Everett Dean's team a seve-n-and-four record and marked Stanford's
to beat Cal, 6 to 5, on Saturday.

fixth consecutive California Inter
collegiate Baseball Association win.
The Cards won the Friday tifl
with UCLA on what might be called
a double Frank Merriwell finish.
Stanford came from behind with
two outs in both the ninth and
tenth innings to guillotine the
Bruins.
Coach Art Reichle's Bruins led
<1 to 5 going into the last id' the
ninth. Pitcher nick Gilson got
shortstop Warren Goodrich to
ground out harmlessly and then
struck out enter fielder Dick
Cole. Many started few the exits
as Jack Shepard came up. lie
greeted a (iilson offering and
slashed it into center for a single.
One more out was all Gilson
needed, but he issued walks to
left fielder Chuck Essegian and
right fielder Hal Skillman.
The hook came from the wings
and Gilson was lifted in favor of

Bob MacNeil. To the utter delight
of everyone except the Bruins,
MacNeil's erratic first pitch eluded
the grasp of catcher Jerry Thomas,
and Shepard headed for the plate
like Hugasian heading for the goal.
He made it with the tying run.
In the top of the tenth, the Bru
ins prolonged their stay of execu
tion by scoring twice. Center field
er Ilal Crow lofted a triple to cen
ter to chase in Tiny Ted Narleski
and Ron Gerst, both of whom had
walked.
The Bruins were in command
now, 8 (o (!, and it was time for
the second Stanford Frank Mer
riwell finish.
Pinch - hitter Art Ahrahamson
led oil the inning bv walking, and
then MacNeil retired the next
two men. Again spectators began
heading for the exits and again
Indian batsmen decided to chase
them back to their seats.
Cole lined a bullet single into
center and then Shepard, who has
regained the batting eye that made
him the scourge of the league last
year, stepped to plate. All Shep did
was to park a 470-foot triple into

center field that was still growing
muscles as it sailed over the center
fielder's head. Co - captain Abra
hamson and Cole scored.
Shepard rambled home with the
winning run a moment later when
MacNeil fired his second wild pitch.
The Cal game was no less spec
tacular than the UCLA contest.
Stanford drew first blood with two
runs in the first. Rich Scramaglia,
the freshman scooter from San
Francisco, drew a walk and then
Goodrich banged out a hit to cen
ter. It looked like any other hit,
but Cal's Cas Munoz pulled a clas
sic in misjudging the ball as he
raced in and it whizzed over his
head for a home run.
Clint Evans' team scored three in
the sixth on the strength of a freak
play that would have been a com
edy if it weren't .so nsar-tragic for
the Stanford cause. Munoz walked,
and then Tom Pollock, intending to
bunt, popped up 20 feet in front of
home plate. Pitcher Bob Murphy,
Shepard, and catcher Dick Corzine
went racing alter it and the result
was a three-way collision with the
ball popping out of Murphy's glove.
All three lay in a heap as the
runners raced around the bases.
Shep finally got up and retrieved
the ball and held the runners on
second and third. But the damage
had been done, and Cal scored three
times in that inning.
The Bears led 4 to 2 going into
the eighth. Then Essegian, han
dling the bat like it was a tooth
pick, ripped a triple up the hill
in left field to score Cole and
Shepard, both of whom had sin
gled. The poker-faced footballer
put the Deaninen ahead a mo
ment later as he tallied on Cor
zine's squeeze play.
