# Crewmen Down Oregon State
## 
### HARRY MARTIN 
Stanford's crew representatives,
varsity and junior varsity, rowed to
their second consecutive victory on
the Willamette River, outside of
Corvallis, last Saturday against a
less experienced Oregon State out
fit.
It was the crew's latest triumph
since Coach Bob White's orphan
squad defeated Southern California
by four lengths for the Roxy Cup.
The Indian varsity rowed to an
other four-length victory yesterday
in 9:56 minutes over the regular
Olympic course of 2,000 meters. As
sistant Coach Dave Draves' JV
eight coasted to a three-length win
in the time of 10:40.
The boating for the Corvallis test
was composed of coxswain, Peter
Paup; stroke, Bill Findlay; No. 7,
Ken Lewis (crew captain); No. G,
Harry Loskamp; No. 5, Hal Cam
pen; No, 4, Mat Schmutz; No. 3,
Hunter Land; No. 2, A 1 Sortor; and
bow, Ted Cannis in the varsity
shell.
Coach Draves' JV boat had cox
swain, Willis Potter; stroke, Hugh
Dewitt; No. 7, Mark Sowers; No. 6,
Hugh Johnston; No. 5, Mark Dees;
No. 4, Bill Hall; No. 3, Bob Margo
lis; No. 2, Forest Scholpp; and bow,
John Monroe.
Stanford's two boats received no
financial assistance for the Corval

lis trip and competed in borrowed
shells. The bulk of funds are be
ing kept on reserve for the coming
National Regatta and, if the money
holds out, the Olympic trials.
The crew will resume daily work
outs for the coming meet with two
UCLA shells this Saturday morning
at 11 in the Palo Alto Yacht Harbor,
which is at the foot of Embarcadero
Road. The finish line is under the
power wire which crosses the har
bor.
