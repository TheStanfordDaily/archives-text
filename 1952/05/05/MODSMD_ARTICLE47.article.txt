### MARY MASSEY 
II was years ago that "Padre"
; Gardner, Stanford s first chaplain
| set nut to help the sick children oi
San Francisco who needed longei
re:.t periods than they were allowec
in various hospitals and clinics
With the aid of students, social
workers, and friends Dr. Gardnei
organized the summer camp v/hich
evolved into present Stanford Con
vale cent Home —offering sunshine
good food, and rest to about 80 kid>
four to 32 years old.
The first Labor Day was insti
tuted at the Con Home when Almon
15. Loth, then University business
manager, organized some students
to clean up the dust and tra c h
around the home before Dr. Gard
ner and the directors surveyed the
.sii.e. As a re ult, the home and the
'17 surrounding acres wore leased
for the Home's peimancnt resi
dence.
Student Helpers
To clear the overgrown grounds
around the Con Home Mr. Roth
and his original helpers enlisted
more students to make the outside
more presentable. The following
year Sam McDonald joined their
forces and c onatod lambs which he
himself barbecued for the students'
dinner. This Wednesday will see the
21) th such Labor Day at the Con
Home.
When kids arrive at the Con
Home, they are underweight, pal
lid, and listless. When they leave
after an average six- to eight-month
stay, thev are heavier, healthier,
and happier. The children are ci
ther "runabouts" or bed patients.
Four hours a day are devoted to
school and two hours to rest. In
between, the children have fun in
their playground, treehouse, and
clubhouse. The kids al.o have a
life-sized three - room playhouse,
which is furnished like a real house
with dishes, stove (it really cooks),
fireplace, chairs, and tables.
Red Patients
Bed patients are brought craft
work of various types, including
weaving and woodwork. On week
ends, the kids look forward to cir
cuses, parties, carnivals, "chuck
wagon"' dinners, or playing cowboys.
Stanford is the only university
that supports a charity of this
kind. In addition to the Stanford
contribution, the Con Home re
ceives aid from the San Francisco
Community Chest, the Mcnlo Cir
cus Club, the Elks, Rotary, and
various women's auxiliaries.
