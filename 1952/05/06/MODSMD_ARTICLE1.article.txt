PITTSBURGH. Ma.v (IT)
Stool production climbed rapidly
t"'lay a.s CIO United Steel workers,
"working fot the governmenl," re
ported in full force.
The American Iron and Steel In
stitute declined to estimate produc
tion because of sketchy reports, but !
an unofficial source said output of i
steel ingots may have reached two- I
third i of capacity today.
The la t holdout workers, 1,000 j
members of the USW local ;it tlie
Mone.sson, Pa., plant of the Pitts
burgh Steel Curp, began streaming
back to work as the mill opened to
day. They had defied CIO President
Philip Murray's Saturday order
ending a three-day walkout, de
claring they would not work with
out a contract.
However, when Murray pointed
out they thould work while the
mills were in government hands
under federal court o;der, they re
ported for duly.
