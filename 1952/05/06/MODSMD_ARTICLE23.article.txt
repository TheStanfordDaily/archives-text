Bean Day was innovated in 1933
when campus living groups served
beans and apples for lunch and the
30 cents saved per person was given
to the Con Home. After eating uch
a lunch, students were so hungry
that they headed for the first Straw
berry Brunch and thereby furthered
the Con Home cause.
"Gone With the Wind ' joined the
Con Hotne roster in 1949 when a
special showing of the film was ar
ranged in Memorial Auditorium as
a money-raiser.
Con Home Week even perser
vcrcd through the War Years.
Farm coeds and the remaining
roughs continued the traditional
physical labor and fund-raising for
the Home. The Strawberry Brunch
became Strawberry Punch due to
rationing and shortages, but the
annual festivities went ahead just
the same.
A Masque Ball was a feature of
Con Home Week No. 1, and in 19110,
a King and Queen Contest was
added. Campus luminaries were
nominated and voted for at a penny
a-ballot. The royalty was unmasked
in the middle of the dance.
"Back to the Farm Day" was in
cluded in the 11 Con Home Week.
Clothes out of 1890 were in style,
and no motor vehicles were allowed
on campus. To insure perfect at
mosphere, roads were actually
blocked ofT.

from Ruble" sold the red and while
cardboard squares at 10 cents
apiece. These first tags directed,
"Keep "em Smiling."
