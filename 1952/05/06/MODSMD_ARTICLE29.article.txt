# Gas Rationing Spectre Rises
## 
### 
DENVfiR, May 5 (UP) A high government official predicted
tonight that gasoline rationing may bo "ju:>t around the corner"
as the pinch of the nationwide oil strike grew tighter and the
Wage Stabilization Board stepped back into the critical dinpute.
Rut another high authority said there will be no rationing, and

the oil workers lowered their wage
demands from 25 to cents an
hour, lending hope that an early
agreement might be reached.
The Petroleum Administration ft. i
Defense (PAD), meanwhile, issued
an order further curtailing the rie
livery of most major oil product:. !o
re-sellers and large-volume eon .tun -
ers.
The order, similar to one issued
by PAD last Thursday applying to
17 Eastern states, becomes eiYective
at .'»:() 1 a.m. EDT tomorrow and will
include all states except Washing
ton, Oregon, California, Nevada,
and Arizona.
The PAD order prohibits deliveries
of automotive gasoline, kerqsene,
some heating oil, iliesel fuel and
residual oil to re-sellers or large
volume consumers who hold more
than 10 days supply, and prohibit ,
deliveries to gas, water or electric
utilities which hold more than a 13-
day supply.
PAD said it extended the decree
"to conserve supplies of motor gas
oline and other major petroleum
products depleted by strikes in th :
oil industry."
James K. Knudsoti, defense
transportation administrator, said
nationwide gas rationing may he
"just around the corner," claiming
that if the strike continues a few
more days the government will be
bound to put some restrictions on
supplies to civilians. He said a
system probably would he put into
efTect similar to the "old days of
the A, I? and C cards."
But Secretary ol Interior Oscai 1..
Chapman said the government ha;
not set up necessary machinery for
rationing motor fuel to civilians ami
that "it would take too long to do
so now."
The 00,000 striking oil worker ,
members of 22 CIO, AFL and In
dependent oil unions, lowered their
wage demands from 25 to 18Va cents
an hour.
