# 'Apathy'? Or Interest in Something Else
## 
### 
The just-completed ASSU elections were ac
companied by the perennial promises to battle
"student apathy."
And our first reaction was to remember what
AiSSU President Wayne Alley pointed out at
the Student Workshop last quarter—that often
what is called apathy is actually interest in
something else.
It seems to us the time has come for student
government to pause a minute, look around, and
get its bearings. The time has come for organi
sations to ask themselves, "Are we being real
istic in our demands?" before they go on de
ploring the lack of support for their activities.
This does not mean that we think campus or- *
ganizations should stop trying to give the stu
dent body the activities they want—or that an
end should be put to the type of publicity that
insures that everyone who wants to get into
an activity knows how to go about it.
What we do mean is this:

That the Colored Slide Society should not cry
"Apathy! Apathy!" when it fails to fill an audi
torium the same night as an all-campus dance,
four public meetings, and three lectures.
That social pressure should be removed from
the people who after years of intensive high
school activities decide to spend their time
studying—and from the people who have made
the decision to devote themselves solely to one
or two activities. A University of all places
should permit some individuality.
It was interesting to note in last weeks' Daily
Frosh Edition editorial that even the freshmen—
for whom organizational publicity can well be
justified—are pleading for mercy. It might be
well for anyone who announces his intentions
of doing battle against "apathy" first to consider
carefully whether he will really arouse the
apathetic or only embitter the already busy.
