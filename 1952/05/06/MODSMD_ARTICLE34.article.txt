K;il|)h ihe Eskimo —A Fable
A very long time ago (it doesn t matter when—it
never does), there was an eskimo named Ralph. Ralph
wa: just a run of the mill eskimo, living where all the
other eskimos lived, eating what all the other eskimos
c-at, seeing what all the other eskimos see. (This in
( hides Alaska, Greenland, walruses, whales, icebergs,
and polar bears.) Ralph had a wife, or what passed
as h wife with the other eskimos (actually she was
an eskimo), but he was unhappy. He had three
children, all of whom did the things that eskimo
children are supposed to do, but Ralph was not happy.
For a run of the mill eskimo this was strange,
for there is not a hell of a lot that an eskimo can be
unhappy about. Without, as the philosophy depart
ment says, basic concepts of happiness an eskimo
< iijjiiot be unhappy: he doesn't know how. (A thing
which seems quite unfair to me, but, then, I am loaded
with basic concepts.)
The other eskimos looked on Ralph as a sort of
subversive person. They felt that he was experienc
ing something that they could not and thought that
ho was probably a spy. This should have made
Li'lph happy, hut it did not. He was still unhappy.
The eskimos never bothered to do anything about
Ralph's unhappiness; they felt that it was up to
Ral|»!i to work it out for himself. So did Ralph.
For a run of the mill eskimo this is a bad state, and
one morning Ralph decided to do something about it.
"To hell with life," he thought, as he crawled nimbly
out of his igloo. (If there is one thing that an eskimo
learns to do, it's to crawl nimbly out of his igloo—
otherwise there is the problem of becoming a frosted
food.) Ralph saw his wife who had proceeded him
out of the igloo. "To hell with you, too," he said,
ignoring the ireshly caught fish that she dangled be-
In i his nose for breakfast, "Probably a red herring."
Ralph saw his children. "To hell with all three of
you," lie said, cleverly conserving his energy. (In the
arctic where there were no Tootsie Rolls, the eskimos
had to be careful not to repeat themselves. Energy
doesn't grow on trees, you know.) Ralph saw the

other eskimos. "To hell with all of you," lie said,
shaking his fist in the air and looking very much like
an orator. The other eskimos thought it strange that
he would say this. They obviously didn't want to go
to hell. They held a meeting.
"Ralph," they said, "why did you, a run of the
mill eskimo, tell us to go to hell." This was a per
fectly natural question, they thought. Ralph looked
at them. He hiinked twice. (This had nothing to
<!o with his thought process; his eyes were freezing
over.)
"Now that you ask . . said Ralph .. .
"Yes, we ask," said the others. "Now."
"Well, things are pretty bad around here," said
Ralph.
"Things?" asked the others. They had not heard
of basic concepts either.
"Things," said Ralph. "Things are pretty bad. They
are getting worse." He had forgotten about conserving
energy. "They will get worse later on."
"Oh," said the others. They had another meeting.
Ralph was getting cold, so he went back to his igloo
and ate the fish. He kissed his wife, murmuring, "To
hell with you, but I don't care, you're stacked." Things
were not as bad as he thought. This gave the other
eskimos time for their meeting. They called Ralph
out of his igloo.
"Why?" they asked.
"Well," said Ralph, "I am hist a run of the mill
eskimo. I try hard to he that. I try hard to enjoy
being a run of the mill eskimo. Sometimes I have
to tell myself five times a day that I am enjoying
myself. 1 have been known to light this feeling, but
things have gone as far as they can. "Has." he con
tinued, getting a firm grip on himself (try a mental
picture of a man getting a firm grip on himself), "it
ever occurred to you . . ."
"What?" asked the others. They were stupid, but
they didn't care.
"Simply," said Ralph, "that there arc no mills
around here for me to run."
The other eskimos killed him and fed him to a
polar bear. The bear was thankful.
MORAL: Polar bears will eat anything.

K;il|)h ihe Eskimo —A Fable
A very long time ago (it doesn t matter when—it
never does), there was an eskimo named Ralph. Ralph
wa: just a run of the mill eskimo, living where all the
other eskimos lived, eating what all the other eskimos
c-at, seeing what all the other eskimos see. (This in
( hides Alaska, Greenland, walruses, whales, icebergs,
and polar bears.) Ralph had a wife, or what passed
as h wife with the other eskimos (actually she was
an eskimo), but he was unhappy. He had three
children, all of whom did the things that eskimo
children are supposed to do, but Ralph was not happy.
For a run of the mill eskimo this was strange,
for there is not a hell of a lot that an eskimo can be
unhappy about. Without, as the philosophy depart
ment says, basic concepts of happiness an eskimo
< iijjiiot be unhappy: he doesn't know how. (A thing
which seems quite unfair to me, but, then, I am loaded
with basic concepts.)
The other eskimos looked on Ralph as a sort of
subversive person. They felt that he was experienc
ing something that they could not and thought that
ho was probably a spy. This should have made
Li'lph happy, hut it did not. He was still unhappy.
The eskimos never bothered to do anything about
Ralph's unhappiness; they felt that it was up to
Ral|»!i to work it out for himself. So did Ralph.
For a run of the mill eskimo this is a bad state, and
one morning Ralph decided to do something about it.
"To hell with life," he thought, as he crawled nimbly
out of his igloo. (If there is one thing that an eskimo
learns to do, it's to crawl nimbly out of his igloo—
otherwise there is the problem of becoming a frosted
food.) Ralph saw his wife who had proceeded him
out of the igloo. "To hell with you, too," he said,
ignoring the ireshly caught fish that she dangled be-
In i his nose for breakfast, "Probably a red herring."
Ralph saw his children. "To hell with all three of
you," lie said, cleverly conserving his energy. (In the
arctic where there were no Tootsie Rolls, the eskimos
had to be careful not to repeat themselves. Energy
doesn't grow on trees, you know.) Ralph saw the

other eskimos. "To hell with all of you," lie said,
shaking his fist in the air and looking very much like
an orator. The other eskimos thought it strange that
he would say this. They obviously didn't want to go
to hell. They held a meeting.
"Ralph," they said, "why did you, a run of the
mill eskimo, tell us to go to hell." This was a per
fectly natural question, they thought. Ralph looked
at them. He hiinked twice. (This had nothing to
<!o with his thought process; his eyes were freezing
over.)
"Now that you ask . . said Ralph .. .
"Yes, we ask," said the others. "Now."
"Well, things are pretty bad around here," said
Ralph.
"Things?" asked the others. They had not heard
of basic concepts either.
"Things," said Ralph. "Things are pretty bad. They
are getting worse." He had forgotten about conserving
energy. "They will get worse later on."
"Oh," said the others. They had another meeting.
Ralph was getting cold, so he went back to his igloo
and ate the fish. He kissed his wife, murmuring, "To
hell with you, but I don't care, you're stacked." Things
were not as bad as he thought. This gave the other
eskimos time for their meeting. They called Ralph
out of his igloo.
"Why?" they asked.
"Well," said Ralph, "I am hist a run of the mill
eskimo. I try hard to he that. I try hard to enjoy
being a run of the mill eskimo. Sometimes I have
to tell myself five times a day that I am enjoying
myself. 1 have been known to light this feeling, but
things have gone as far as they can. "Has." he con
tinued, getting a firm grip on himself (try a mental
picture of a man getting a firm grip on himself), "it
ever occurred to you . . ."

K;il|)h ihe Eskimo —A Fable
A very long time ago (it doesn t matter when—it
never does), there was an eskimo named Ralph. Ralph
wa: just a run of the mill eskimo, living where all the
other eskimos lived, eating what all the other eskimos
c-at, seeing what all the other eskimos see. (This in
( hides Alaska, Greenland, walruses, whales, icebergs,
and polar bears.) Ralph had a wife, or what passed
as h wife with the other eskimos (actually she was
an eskimo), but he was unhappy. He had three
children, all of whom did the things that eskimo
children are supposed to do, but Ralph was not happy.
For a run of the mill eskimo this was strange,
for there is not a hell of a lot that an eskimo can be
unhappy about. Without, as the philosophy depart
ment says, basic concepts of happiness an eskimo
< iijjiiot be unhappy: he doesn't know how. (A thing
which seems quite unfair to me, but, then, I am loaded
with basic concepts.)
The other eskimos looked on Ralph as a sort of
subversive person. They felt that he was experienc
ing something that they could not and thought that
ho was probably a spy. This should have made
Li'lph happy, hut it did not. He was still unhappy.
The eskimos never bothered to do anything about
Ralph's unhappiness; they felt that it was up to
Ral|»!i to work it out for himself. So did Ralph.
For a run of the mill eskimo this is a bad state, and
one morning Ralph decided to do something about it.
"To hell with life," he thought, as he crawled nimbly
out of his igloo. (If there is one thing that an eskimo
learns to do, it's to crawl nimbly out of his igloo—
otherwise there is the problem of becoming a frosted
food.) Ralph saw his wife who had proceeded him
out of the igloo. "To hell with you, too," he said,
ignoring the ireshly caught fish that she dangled be-
In i his nose for breakfast, "Probably a red herring."
Ralph saw his children. "To hell with all three of
you," lie said, cleverly conserving his energy. (In the
arctic where there were no Tootsie Rolls, the eskimos
had to be careful not to repeat themselves. Energy
doesn't grow on trees, you know.) Ralph saw the

other eskimos. "To hell with all of you," lie said,
shaking his fist in the air and looking very much like
an orator. The other eskimos thought it strange that
he would say this. They obviously didn't want to go
to hell. They held a meeting.
"Ralph," they said, "why did you, a run of the
mill eskimo, tell us to go to hell." This was a per
fectly natural question, they thought. Ralph looked
at them. He hiinked twice. (This had nothing to
<!o with his thought process; his eyes were freezing
over.)
"Now that you ask . . said Ralph .. .
"Yes, we ask," said the others. "Now."
"Well, things are pretty bad around here," said
Ralph.
"Things?" asked the others. They had not heard
of basic concepts either.
"Things," said Ralph. "Things are pretty bad. They
are getting worse." He had forgotten about conserving
energy. "They will get worse later on."
"Oh," said the others. They had another meeting.
Ralph was getting cold, so he went back to his igloo
and ate the fish. He kissed his wife, murmuring, "To
hell with you, but I don't care, you're stacked." Things
were not as bad as he thought. This gave the other
eskimos time for their meeting. They called Ralph
out of his igloo.
"Why?" they asked.
"Well," said Ralph, "I am hist a run of the mill
eskimo. I try hard to he that. I try hard to enjoy
being a run of the mill eskimo. Sometimes I have
to tell myself five times a day that I am enjoying
myself. 1 have been known to light this feeling, but
things have gone as far as they can. "Has." he con
tinued, getting a firm grip on himself (try a mental
