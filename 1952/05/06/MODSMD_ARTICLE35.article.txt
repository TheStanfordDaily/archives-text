## Punishment and the Fundamental Standard 
### 
Tii the Editor:
The Fundamental Standard method of dealing out
punishment at Stanford falls far short ol the "lair
warning" and"due process of law" guarantees that
Anglo-American courts have for centuries given even
the most hardened criminal.
No legitimate court would hesitate to declare void
for vagueness legislation purporting to punish those
who did not show that "respect for order, morality,
pel :onal honor, and the rights of others as is de
manded of good citizens."
Suggested action:
1) That men's and women's councils cease to punish
any student if the grounds for such punishment
can only be found by reference to the vague
ethical concepts embodied in the Fundamental
Standard.
2) That Excom pass a resolution to the effect that
while the Fundamental Standard is still morally
landing on Stanford students it is no longer
legally enforceable by any instrumentality of the
Associated Students of Stanford University.
'!) 'i hat Excom request the University to abandon
the Fundamental Standard as a basis for punish
ment.
