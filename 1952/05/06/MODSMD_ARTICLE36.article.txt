# 'Unfair Comparison'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I object to the unfair comparison of a campus dining
hall to "any restaurant or fountain grill" made in the
letter signed by the R.A.'s and Sponsors of Ericina.

It is stated that "if the writers (referring to Messers.
Berarclinelli, Irwin, Stevenson, and Handmaker) of
that letter had taken the effort to consult the owner
of any restaurant or fountain grill they would have
found that if such an establishment were to spend 55<*
out of every dollar on raw food, they would be bank
rupt in a very short while.''
This statement per sc. may he quite true, but to
compare the costs of running public restaurants
with that of non-profit, tax and rent free establish
ments such as our campus dining halls is a statistical
misuse because these are non-comparable data.
This is so because:
1. No restaurant has a guaranteed minimum num
ber of meals which it will serve.
2. A restaurant must be prepared to offer any
thing appearing on its menu, and does not serve just
one given meal, as is issued to us on campus.
!». Most eating places in town bring the food to you
—and you need not even strain your voice to make
audible contact with the person across the table from
you, which is a 'far cry' from Encina dining hall.
4. Theoretically at least, campus dining halls, being
a non-profit organization, should be able to spend a
greater portion of its dollar on food.
There are many other considerations which can
not be dealt with in this limited space.
My only suggestion to those who made this interest
ing comparison is to follow their own advice, "it is
unwise to state figures without a full explanation of
their meaning."
