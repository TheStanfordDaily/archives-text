# 'La Ronde' Termed Graceful Comedy
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
"La Ronde," the French picture now at the Guild, was catapulted
to notoriety last summer when it was banned in New York on
grounds that it would corrupt public morality. A ridiculous charge
—yet so much the better, since, in more liberal-minded cities,
audiences were piqued into seeing a superbly adult comedy which

might otherwise have gone relative
ly unnoticed.
Adapted for the screen by Max
Ophuls from Arthur Schnitzler's
"Reigen," the film consists of ten

vignettes which
make up a
"round of love."
The first is be
tween a prosti
tute and a sol
dier, who takes
up with a serv
ant girl, who
goes on to her
employer's son,

and so forth. By this overlapping
technique, each incident, while
treated quite apart from the others,
is woven into the circle which ends
with a •count and the original pros
titute.
Further carrying out the motif
is the external device of a merry
go-rouni', which, conducted by
Anton Wallhrook to a charming
Oscar Strauss waltz, intercedes
between each vignette. By very
token of confessing to Schnitzler's
artificial method and then accen
tuating it, the merry - go - round
predisposes possible accusations of
a story too irrilatingly clever or
patly told.
While so amusingly cynical a look
at the art of seduction would be
enough to distinguish "La Ronde,"
what raises it to heights virtually
never achieved by film comedy is
the depth of its insight. Briefly as
each character is seen, his or her
life, manners, morals are revealed
to an amazing degree thVough what
appear to be only the sketchiest of
flashes. The prostitute, to be sure,
is no special prostitute, and there is
nothing particularly unusual about
the count, but they do emerge as
something more than stock types;
they do allow for a striking cross
section of a whole society, from top
to bottom.
Eleven of Europe's finest and
most glittering actors and actresses
(including Simone Simon, Jean-
Louis Barrault, Danielle Darrieux,
Simone Signoret) have joined to
gether to give what must be count-

Ed, in each case, a great perform
ance—sure, knowing, subtle. These,
together with Ophuls' light-handed
direction and some beautiful pho
tography, make "La Ronde" a film
eminently worth seeing, preferably
twice: once for the sheer delight of
its ironic tale and adroit method,
again for a complete appreciation of
its splendid portrayals. Graceful,
always in perfect taste, it is that
rarest of all gems—a sophisticated
comedy endowed not merely with
form, but with content as well.

Simone Signoret) have joined to
gether to give what must be count-

Ed, in each case, a great perform
ance—sure, knowing, subtle. These,
together with Ophuls' light-handed
direction and some beautiful pho
tography, make "La Ronde" a film
eminently worth seeing, preferably
twice: once for the sheer delight of
its ironic tale and adroit method,
again for a complete appreciation of
its splendid portrayals. Graceful,
always in perfect taste, it is that
rarest of all gems—a sophisticated
comedy endowed not merely with
form, but with content as well.

"La Ronde," the French picture now at the Guild, was catapulted
to notoriety last summer when it was banned in New York on
grounds that it would corrupt public morality. A ridiculous charge
—yet so much the better, since, in more liberal-minded cities,
audiences were piqued into seeing a superbly adult comedy which

might otherwise have gone relative
ly unnoticed.
Adapted for the screen by Max
Ophuls from Arthur Schnitzler's
"Reigen," the film consists of ten

vignettes which
make up a
"round of love."
The first is be
tween a prosti
tute and a sol
dier, who takes
up with a serv
ant girl, who
goes on to her
employer's son,

and so forth. By this overlapping
technique, each incident, while
treated quite apart from the others,
is woven into the circle which ends
with a •count and the original pros
titute.
Further carrying out the motif
is the external device of a merry
go-rouni', which, conducted by
Anton Wallhrook to a charming
Oscar Strauss waltz, intercedes
between each vignette. By very
token of confessing to Schnitzler's
artificial method and then accen
tuating it, the merry - go - round
predisposes possible accusations of
a story too irrilatingly clever or
patly told.
While so amusingly cynical a look
at the art of seduction would be
enough to distinguish "La Ronde,"
what raises it to heights virtually
never achieved by film comedy is
the depth of its insight. Briefly as
each character is seen, his or her
life, manners, morals are revealed
to an amazing degree thVough what
appear to be only the sketchiest of
flashes. The prostitute, to be sure,
is no special prostitute, and there is
nothing particularly unusual about
the count, but they do emerge as
something more than stock types;
they do allow for a striking cross
section of a whole society, from top
to bottom.
