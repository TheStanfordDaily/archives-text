# JV Trackmen and Baseballers Win
## Cindermen In Impressive Win 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
Stanford's weekend in sports was
impressive by itself, but the most
impressive victory of ail came from
Coach Ray Dean's unsung JV
track team. They completely over
whelmed the combined Cal Blt.es
and Colds in a "convincing" slaugh
ter, 8:5 1/6 to 47 5/6.
It was a convincing win all the
way, as the Braves came out of the
Shoot flying fast and were ne"er
headed. They took 12 out of 15
firsts and put forward nine individ
ual top performances of the season
as the meet rolled on.
It started in the field events. Bob
Rhodes came through with his best
discus performance of the season by
2 ft. 7 in. to down Cal's Doug Gor
don at 122 ft. 7 in.
In the shot put, Phil Brabyn out
put his previous best with a 45-ft.
6-in. effort to again nose out Dowd.
In the pole vault, Stanford's "Ma
thias of the mighty mights," Jim
Mclndoe, and teammate Gerald
Olmstead both came through with
their season best of 12 feet.
Mclndoe entered three events and
was nut beaten by a Cal man. He
took second behind John Steinberg
in the highs and a close third be
hind John Bugge and Dick Holmes
in the javelin. Bugge's, winning
tos> was a season best of 177 ft.
10% in.
Only double winner of the day
was A 1 JVlendel in the dashes. He
took the 100 and 220 in wind-slowed
times of :10.3 and :2"J.2 respec
tively.
The wind had little effect upon
Dick Black as he nosed out Cal's
Art Stewart in 50 seconds flat. This
shaves one second off his previous
season best.
In the 880, Dave Fletcher went
the four fourlongs 2Va seconds faster
than he has this year as he nosed
out Cal's favored Ed Hersh in a
flashy 1:58.5.
Jim Seebold added 10 inches to
his seasonal best in the broad jump
as he flew through the air 22 ft.
V-l in.
To add to the debacle, Ed Griffing
romped home first by 20 yards in
the two-mile in 10:14.4 and the
Card relay team of Myron Hollister,
Dave Fletcher, Dick Black, and
Walt Garrett nosed out the favored
Bears in a spectacular 3:21.8.

Stanford's weekend in sports was
impressive by itself, but the most
impressive victory of ail came from
Coach Ray Dean's unsung JV
track team. They completely over
whelmed the combined Cal Blt.es
and Colds in a "convincing" slaugh
ter, 8:5 1/6 to 47 5/6.
It was a convincing win all the
way, as the Braves came out of the
Shoot flying fast and were ne"er
headed. They took 12 out of 15
firsts and put forward nine individ
ual top performances of the season
as the meet rolled on.
It started in the field events. Bob
Rhodes came through with his best
discus performance of the season by
2 ft. 7 in. to down Cal's Doug Gor
don at 122 ft. 7 in.
In the shot put, Phil Brabyn out
put his previous best with a 45-ft.
6-in. effort to again nose out Dowd.
In the pole vault, Stanford's "Ma
thias of the mighty mights," Jim
Mclndoe, and teammate Gerald
Olmstead both came through with
their season best of 12 feet.
Mclndoe entered three events and
was nut beaten by a Cal man. He
took second behind John Steinberg
in the highs and a close third be
hind John Bugge and Dick Holmes
in the javelin. Bugge's, winning
tos> was a season best of 177 ft.
10% in.
Only double winner of the day
was A 1 JVlendel in the dashes. He
took the 100 and 220 in wind-slowed
times of :10.3 and :2"J.2 respec
tively.
The wind had little effect upon
Dick Black as he nosed out Cal's
Art Stewart in 50 seconds flat. This
shaves one second off his previous
season best.
In the 880, Dave Fletcher went
the four fourlongs 2Va seconds faster
than he has this year as he nosed
out Cal's favored Ed Hersh in a
flashy 1:58.5.
Jim Seebold added 10 inches to
his seasonal best in the broad jump
as he flew through the air 22 ft.
V-l in.
To add to the debacle, Ed Griffing
romped home first by 20 yards in
the two-mile in 10:14.4 and the
Card relay team of Myron Hollister,
Dave Fletcher, Dick Black, and
Walt Garrett nosed out the favored
Bears in a spectacular 3:21.8.

Stanford's weekend in sports was
impressive by itself, but the most
impressive victory of ail came from
Coach Ray Dean's unsung JV
track team. They completely over
whelmed the combined Cal Blt.es
and Colds in a "convincing" slaugh
ter, 8:5 1/6 to 47 5/6.
It was a convincing win all the
way, as the Braves came out of the
Shoot flying fast and were ne"er
headed. They took 12 out of 15
firsts and put forward nine individ
ual top performances of the season
as the meet rolled on.
It started in the field events. Bob
Rhodes came through with his best
discus performance of the season by
2 ft. 7 in. to down Cal's Doug Gor
don at 122 ft. 7 in.
In the shot put, Phil Brabyn out
put his previous best with a 45-ft.
6-in. effort to again nose out Dowd.
In the pole vault, Stanford's "Ma
thias of the mighty mights," Jim
Mclndoe, and teammate Gerald
Olmstead both came through with
their season best of 12 feet.
Mclndoe entered three events and
was nut beaten by a Cal man. He
took second behind John Steinberg
in the highs and a close third be
hind John Bugge and Dick Holmes
in the javelin. Bugge's, winning
tos> was a season best of 177 ft.
10% in.
Only double winner of the day
was A 1 JVlendel in the dashes. He
took the 100 and 220 in wind-slowed
times of :10.3 and :2"J.2 respec
tively.
The wind had little effect upon
Dick Black as he nosed out Cal's
Art Stewart in 50 seconds flat. This
shaves one second off his previous
season best.
In the 880, Dave Fletcher went
the four fourlongs 2Va seconds faster
than he has this year as he nosed
out Cal's favored Ed Hersh in a
flashy 1:58.5.
Jim Seebold added 10 inches to
his seasonal best in the broad jump
as he flew through the air 22 ft.
V-l in.
To add to the debacle, Ed Griffing
romped home first by 20 yards in
the two-mile in 10:14.4 and the
Card relay team of Myron Hollister,
Dave Fletcher, Dick Black, and
Walt Garrett nosed out the favored
Bears in a spectacular 3:21.8.

Discus—Rhodes; 2, Dowd (C); 3,
Reynaud. 122 ft. 7 in.
