# Kappa Sigs Top Capitan
## 
### 
Bob Monteith's three run homer
in the last inning broke an 11-11 tie
to give Kappa Sig II a 14-11 victory
over El. Capitan yesterday. It was
Monteith's second circuit clout of
the game, and climaxed a 12-run in
ning which brought the Kappa Sigs
from way behind in the three in
ning affair.
The wild contest also fÂ£htured two
more home runs, a pair of double
plays, and numerous walks and
errors. John Stettson and Dick Win
ter each collected a round tripper
for El Capitan. One twin killing was
executed by the Capitans in the
bottom of the second, as they held
the Kappa Sigs scoreless for the only
blank half-inning of the game, and
the other was put together by the
Kappa Sigs in the top of the third.
Walks, errors, and some timely
base hits accounted for most of the
scoring as El Capitan jumped off to
a 6-2 lead in the first inning, ex
tended it to 9-2 in the second, and
tallied a pair in the top of the third
to set the stage for game winning
rally.
The big 12-run inning was put to
gether with the aid of four walks
and three errors, to which the Kappa
Sigs added five hits, including a
three-run-double by Jack Novak.
Capitan pitchers Mike Zeiler and

Dick Winter were the victims of the
explosion.
