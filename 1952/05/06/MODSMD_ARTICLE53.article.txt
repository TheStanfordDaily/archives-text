# Stanford Nine to Face Sacramento State Today
## 
### 
Stanford's win-happy baseball team will meet Sacramento State
today'at 3:15 in the Sunken Diamond. Coach Everett Dean has his
three sophs, Don DeLong, Phil Page, and Mike Acker ready to go
lor today's contest. Freshman Fred Brown might also throv/ lor an
inning or two. Dean announced that he will give DeLong the start-

ing nod, because of his performance
against San Jose State last week
when he turned in a sparkling re
lief job and appeared to have finally
found home plate.
Sacramento State looked good los
ing two close contests to powerful
Fresno State lust week and should
provide stiff opposition for the Cards.
Despite today's contest, Stanford
fans are looking ahead to next Fri
day's Santa Clara game and Satur
day's crucial double-header against
Cal. The Indians have won six
straight league games. In evaluating
last week's last-gasp wins, Dean had

special praise for Chuck Essegian
and Jack Shepard, who hit so many
times in the clutch, and Kog Osen
baugh, who showed his old stuff de
spite the long lay-off.
Since Stanford finally has its three
aces, Bob Murphy, Joe Chez, and
Osenbaugh all healthy at once, their
chances for the CIBA crown are at
an all-time high. If the Cards can
win two this weekend while the Tro
jans split with UCLA, Stanford
would be in first place. As a side
light, Fresno State has been knocked
out of the running as District eight
representative in the NCAA base
ball tourney. It will be the winner of
the Southern Division champ-North
ern Division champ series, as usual.
