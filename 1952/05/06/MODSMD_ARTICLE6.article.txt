# Debate Delayed

WASHINGTON. May r. The
Senate today ordered a 10-day de
lay in debate on the $6,900,000,000
foreign aid bill to permit the Senate
Armed Services Committee to see
if any of the funds should be di
verted to strengthen U.S. military
forces.
The postponement, was ordered
by a near party-line vote of 40 to
33 despite objections by Senate
Democratic Leader Ernest W. Mc-
Farland that the action would delay
the adjournment of Congress this
summer "by at least three weeks."
