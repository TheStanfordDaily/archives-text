# Stevenson Lashes Voters For Political Indifference
## 
### HADLEY ROFF 
"It's you, you the people who
have fouled the nest, opening
the doors to corruption in gov
ernment," Adlai Stevenson, Il
linois Governor and suggested
Democratic candidate lor Presi
dent, told a thoughtful audience
of 1,000 at a meeting of the Com
monwealth Club in San Fran
cisco yesterday.
Again and again, the man who
ripped much of Illinois' crime out
by the roots emphasized that the
people are to blame for the present
level of government morality.
"Public officials, from top to bot
tom, from the high and the hazy to
the low and the lazv, do not corrupt
each other. We, the people, corrupt
them."
He went on, "Behind every fix
is a fixer, behind every bribe is
the briber, behind every lobby
and influence peddler is someone
who wants the influence."
Never did the Governor relent
from hi.s thesis that the people arc
responsible for the type of govern
ment exercised.
"It seems to me," he said, "that
government is like a pump, and
what it pumps is just what we are —
a fair sample of the intellect, the
ethics, and the morals of the people,
no better, no worse."

Stevenson has a firm jaw and
steady blue eyes, and his voice is
soft but it hides an iron determina
tion to weed out corruption.
"One dishonest official is one too
many," he declared as he outlined
steps that he initiated in Illinois to
clean out crime.
"In Illinois I've knocked out the
slot machines and commercial
gambling by making raids with
the state poliec where local offi
cials refused to do their duty,"
the Northwestern graduate and
Doctor of Jurisprudence reported.
Stevenson's record in Illinois is
considered brilliant. Shrugging off
support from traditional interest
groups, he struck out on his own,

holding down taxes, firing incompe
tents, and boosting fnith in a stale
government which, for a long time,
had been considered nothing but a
sneer.

tional politics. "I haven't the facts
on most issues," he advised.
