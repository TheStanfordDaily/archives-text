OAKLAND, May . r ) (UP) -Bay
Bridge toll collectors and Univer
sity of California zoologists today
took different views of the carcass
of a 20-foot beaked whale beached
in the hot sun near the Oakland
end of the bridge.
Observers said the 2,000 - pound
mammal, left bv the tide yesterday,
apparently had been shot through
the head.
Dr. Seth Benson, associate pro
fessor of zoology and curator of
mammals at UC, said he planned
to lop off the whale's head and pre
serve the skull.
The bridge employees were dis
mayed. "Who's going to take the
rest of it away?" they asked.
The answer came from the Peter
son Tallow Company of Emeryville,
which offered to make fertilizer out
of the carcass if the City of Oak
land would haul it over.
