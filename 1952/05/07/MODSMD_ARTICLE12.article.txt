# ‘RAINBOW’
## Bright Tunes Sparkle Play 
### 
If tunes are any indication of a
show, students who listened to
KZSU's Broadway "Encores last night
got a good notion of what "Finian's
Rainbow" is like.
On the whole, the music is bright,
lively, and fast-moving, with some
tender, dreamy melodies mixed in.
Only one of the tunes, "How Are
Things in Glocca Morra" ever
achieved instant Hit Parade fame.
The musical numbers, under the
direction of John Erickson, music
director and Ray O'Brien, chorus
director, are sung in Irish brogues,
in the cases of Finian, Sharon, and
Or, and in Southern drawls for the
inhabitants of Rainbow Valley.
The songs in the Ram's Head
Spring Show include the tender
"Look to the Rainbow," the "Neces
sity" blues, the gay "Something Sort
of Grandish," and the happy patter
of "When the Idle Poor Become the
Idle Rich."
Other numbers in the melody-rich
show are "The Begat," a bibical par
ody in rhythm, Og's merry confes
sion "When I'm Not Near the Girl I
Love I Love the Girl I'm Near," and
the jubilant finale? "The Great Come
and Gat It Day."
Stanforditcs will get a chance to
hear these songs in their proper set
ting. when "Finian's Rainbow is pre
sented May 15, 18, and 17 in Memorial
j Auditorium at 8:15 p.m.
