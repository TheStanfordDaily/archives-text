# Excom to Discuss 1952-â€™53 Budget At Meet Tonight
## 
### 
ASSU Excom will discuss the
1952-53 budget at their weekly meet
ing tonight at 7:30 in the Excom
Room of the Union.
ASSU President Wayne Alley pre
dicts a comparative short budget
session, since few major changes are
proposed. Slashes in the debate and
Public Relations Committee budgets
may prove controversial, however.
Among the proposed additions to
next year's budget are funds for
printing revised copies of the ASSU
Constitution. This is necessary be
cause several organizations have re
cently changed their bylaws, Alley
explained.
Foreign Scholarship Committee's
bylaws will come up for a rehearing
tonight. At last, week's meeting, rep
resentatives of the iIR and the
Scholarship Committee were as
signed the task of working out com
promise proposals to solve the prob
lem of the two group's overlapping.
Appointments to Cardinals and the
Foreign Scholarship Committee will
also be announced.
