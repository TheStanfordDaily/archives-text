# Sam McDonald, A Modest Chef
## 
### SUE WHEAT 
Down by the football practicc
fields behind the sunken dia
mond, there is a little office with
a roll-top desk, walls plastered
with pictures, and a calendar
that needs changing.
In that office sits the man who can
spin more first-hand yarns about
Stanford's past than probably any
person living today.
That, man is' Sam McDonald.
Sam, who came to Stanford as a
teamster in 1903 and has been here
ever since, serves the University
officially as "Superintendent of
Athletic Buildings and Grounds."
But as any kid at the Con Home can
tell you, Sam is much more than that
to Stanford.
He is the man who during the war
raised fresh potatoes, corn, beans,
and tomatoes in a three acre victory
garden for the kids. He is the man
who to this day welcomes alumni,
their children, and their grand
children as they continually troop in
to say hello.
And he is the man who will bar
becue steaks for the hundreds of
Stanford students expected to mi
grate to the Con Home for a few
hours of work today. Sam is fa

i m»us for his barbecuing talents
and today will be his 20th Con
Home barbecuc.
In soft, gentle accents, Sam will
modestly discredit all stories lauding
his ability as a chef. He insist,
(wrongly) that his fame as a rook
is attributable solely to hearsay.
And when something is suggested
enough," Sam explains, "people be
gin to believe it."
A few years ago Sam's friends en
couraged him to write a book about
Stanford. Drawing from his fund of
memories that stretches back almost
half a century, Sam began the work
and has been writing for two years.
"I'm not a writer," Sam says,"and
it's turning into a bigger job than I
expected." Thumbing through his
completed manuscripts, Sam showed
us ancient clippings and photographs,
yellow and crumbling with age. One
(dated 1912) was a clipping from the
Daily Palo Altan (now the Stanford
Daily) telling of Sam's performance
in the student varsity show put on
to raise funds to send the track team
east.
Sam hopes to have the book
finished this year, ftven after
editing, it promises to be a lengthy
account of his experiences.
Through its pages will step the
personalities of David Starr Jor
dan, Ray Lyman Wilbur, John
Branner, and Pop Warner—whose
autographed images hang on (hr
walls of Sam's office. About the
only historical Stanford figure thai
Sam hasn't met or known inti
mately is Leland himself. (But
even at that he can recall seeing
Mrs. Jane Stanford pass by in a
carriage in the 1890'5.)
Rising to leave the 78-year-old
gentleman, we knew that we eou'd
never describe him accurately in so
many written words. There is a cer
tain kind of humility and kindness
and purpose that cannot be expressed
on the page of a newspaper—and
those arc the qualities that mean Sam
McDonald.
"See you at the Con Home Wednes
day," he smiled as we shook hands
goodbye.
"You bet," was all we could reply.

Rising to leave the 78-year-old
gentleman, we knew that we eou'd
never describe him accurately in so
many written words. There is a cer
tain kind of humility and kindness
and purpose that cannot be expressed
on the page of a newspaper—and
those arc the qualities that mean Sam
McDonald.
"See you at the Con Home Wednes
day," he smiled as we shook hands
goodbye.
"You bet," was all we could reply.
Down by the football practicc
fields behind the sunken dia
mond, there is a little office with
a roll-top desk, walls plastered
with pictures, and a calendar
that needs changing.
In that office sits the man who can
spin more first-hand yarns about
Stanford's past than probably any
person living today.
That, man is' Sam McDonald.
Sam, who came to Stanford as a
teamster in 1903 and has been here
ever since, serves the University
officially as "Superintendent of
Athletic Buildings and Grounds."
But as any kid at the Con Home can
tell you, Sam is much more than that
to Stanford.
He is the man who during the war
raised fresh potatoes, corn, beans,
and tomatoes in a three acre victory
garden for the kids. He is the man
who to this day welcomes alumni,
their children, and their grand
children as they continually troop in
to say hello.
And he is the man who will bar
becue steaks for the hundreds of
Stanford students expected to mi
grate to the Con Home for a few
hours of work today. Sam is fa

i m»us for his barbecuing talents
and today will be his 20th Con
Home barbecuc.
In soft, gentle accents, Sam will
modestly discredit all stories lauding
his ability as a chef. He insist,
(wrongly) that his fame as a rook
is attributable solely to hearsay.
And when something is suggested
enough," Sam explains, "people be
gin to believe it."
A few years ago Sam's friends en
couraged him to write a book about
Stanford. Drawing from his fund of
memories that stretches back almost
half a century, Sam began the work
and has been writing for two years.
"I'm not a writer," Sam says,"and
it's turning into a bigger job than I
expected." Thumbing through his
completed manuscripts, Sam showed
us ancient clippings and photographs,
yellow and crumbling with age. One
(dated 1912) was a clipping from the
Daily Palo Altan (now the Stanford
Daily) telling of Sam's performance
in the student varsity show put on
to raise funds to send the track team
east.
Sam hopes to have the book
finished this year, ftven after
editing, it promises to be a lengthy
account of his experiences.
Through its pages will step the
personalities of David Starr Jor
dan, Ray Lyman Wilbur, John
Branner, and Pop Warner—whose
autographed images hang on (hr
walls of Sam's office. About the
only historical Stanford figure thai
Sam hasn't met or known inti
mately is Leland himself. (But
even at that he can recall seeing
Mrs. Jane Stanford pass by in a
carriage in the 1890'5.)
