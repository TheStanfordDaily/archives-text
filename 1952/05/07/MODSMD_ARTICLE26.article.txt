# Let's Support the Con Home
## 
### 
One of the most colorful chapters in the Stan
ford story is the history of the Stanford Con
valescent Home, known to most of us by the
simpler abbreviation Con Home. An institution
for children of all races recuperating from res
piratory diseases and rheumatic fever, the home
is supported entirely by charity, Stanford being
one of the biggest contributors.
A well-planned week of activities has been
running smoothly, and slips into high gear with
the annual Con Home work day and barbecue
this afternoon. Sam McDonald, whose personal
devotion to the Con Home kids and whose ef
forts over many years in their behalf are an
inspiration, will preside as head chef. '
It the drive falls short, it will not be due to
lack of planning, organization, or execution of

the week's activities. Cardinals, traditional
sponsors of the week, have gone all out. The
rest is up to us. If the drive falls short it will
mean that medical care at the home will also
fall short.
We urge students to participate in the activi
ies remaining this week: Con Home work day
this afternoon, car wash and toy dinner tomor
row, the king and queen contest, the soph carn
ival Friday night, and the Devonshire dance
Saturday night. If you've ever gone out to the
Con Home, you'll see the drive is very much
worthwhile.
And you'll also know that a smile from one
of the kids or the sound of their optimistic
laughter is sufficient reward for any coutribu
tiori of yours in time or money.
