# BULL SESSION
## Wednesday Morning Roundup 
### PETE GROTHE 
The Fundamental Standard Committee won't go for
this, but Professor Walker of the Poly Sci Department,
v/lio is married and has little Walkers, had a blind
date with a Union girl. A blind date that terminated
after two minutes.
It all started when a Stanford student, who was
originally supposed to be the girl's blind date, walked
into Union and buzzed her. Five minutes later, Pro
fessor Walker entered and buzzed th« was

112 upposed to baby sit lor him while
he and his wife stepped out.
The girl, who for the sake of
argument we'll call Mary, was
downstairs before the baby sitter
never having seen her
blind date before (who was sitting
in the corner) she thought Pro-
It ssor Walker was her suitor.
Piofessor Walker, never having
peon his baby sitter before,
thought that Mary was she.

IVljiy and the professor walked to his car and it
occurred to Mary that this was the oldest grad stu
dent she had ever seen.
"I'm sorry I'm late," remarked Mary.
"Oh, you're not late," he said, "I just buzzed.'
"You just buzzed? I thought that you buzzed 10
minutes ago."
One word led to another, and it wasn't long until
each discovered that the other was the wrong party.
'Iliey rushed hack to the Union, and just in time,
because the haby sitter was iust about to step out
with the blind date.

TICKETS, PLEASE. You've often heard about "the
athlete who does everything but take tickets at the
door." Well, Coach Everett Dean of the baseball team
is a man who does everything including taking tickets
at the door.
Several weeks ago. Dean herded his haseballers
to a Santa Clara-San Jose Slate night baseball game.
Dean explained to the ticket taker that the proper
authorities said it was all right to let the team in
free. However, the gatekeeper was a dubious fellow,
and he thought that he had better check and see.
He said, "Okay, fellow, I'll find out. In the mean
time, you take the tickets."
Before the startled Dean could offer a word of pro
test, the gatekeeper had whizzed off and a mob of
people began pouring through the gate. And so there
Deati stood for a painfully lon£ time, collecting tickets
at the Santa Clara-San Jose baseball game.
