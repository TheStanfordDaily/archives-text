# CAMPUS OPINION
## Senior Boat Ride Called Off 
### 
To the Editor:
Last Thursday the Senior Class Excom voted to
cancel the Ferryboat Ride which had been tentatively
planned lor May 30. Because the Ferryboat Ride was
so popular, I thought that I owed a letter ol ex
planation to the student body in general and the
Senior Class in particular.
After a great deal of difficulty on the port of the
chairman in locating the boat, we had to postpone the
original date of the ride from May 2 to May 30 because
the boat was undergoing repairs. Later it was brought
to our attention that because of a new maritime law,
the boat could not stay out in the bay after 9 p.m.
unless it an auxiliary pump. "The Captain Cox,"

the only ferryboat in the bay that could accommodate
a large enough number of people does not have an
auxiliary pump. This would necessitate our leaving
the dock at 7 or 7:30 p.m., while it is' still light, and
returning at I). Since the attraction of the Ferryboat
L'ide is a moonlight cruise, we decided not to have
it this year. We investigated all other possibilities for
rides or picnics on the bay, and none was satisfactory.
The Excom and myself were very sorry that we had
to take this action, but we felt that a twilight boat
ride would riot have sufficient appeal as long as the
price of the tickets would remain the same, $5, and
the facilities were not adequate.
