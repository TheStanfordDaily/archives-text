# 'Three Opinions for the Price of One'

To the Editor:
Three opinions for the price of one.
1) The shock experienced by so many Stanford
women at the recent action of Women's Council is in
all likelihood due to lack of consistency in such action.
Since the effectiveness of a ruling is probably as much
dependent upon consistency of punishment as it is
upon severity, perhaps there should be greater con
sistency, along with less severtiy, in the administra
tion of punishment for violations of social rulings.
2) 1 am speaking as a hasher. It is obvious that
correcting conditions of "over-staffed dining halls"
cannot be done by lengthening the periods in which
meals are served. I believe there is nothing really
to complain about either food or hours of feeding;
actually, it is about time someone offered a compli

ment to the directors and stuffs of the campus dining
halls for the good work they have done. The reul
grievance, perhaps, is in attitude, which might on
both sides be a bit more congenial.
3) I feel the essential question in the Robeson issue
to be: At what level is it appropriate to make de
cisions which are based upon political considerations?
In this particular situation, it is obviously the duty
of the San Francisco Opera House Board to pass on
the qualifications of a singer, as a singer. But in so
far as decisions regarding matters political are re
moved from the level of the people, to that extent
is the system which allows such decisions to be made
a deviation from democracy. Perhaps the political
decision concerning Mr. Robeson should be made at
the ticket window democratically speaking.
