# Strike End Urged
## 
### 
WASHINGTON The government
stepped into the nationwide oil
strike for the first time today, called
for immediate resumption of pro
duction, and summoned union and
industry members to a meeting here
next week.
Simultaneously, Secretary of the
Interior Oscar L. Chapman knocked
down a report by another official
that the government might have to
ration gasoline to motorists similar
to the way it did in World War 11.
