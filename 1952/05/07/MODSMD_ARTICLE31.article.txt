# Graduate Dean Has Many Duties
## 
### JIM MADISON 
When the post of Dean of Graduate Study fell vacant last fall,
President Sterling appointed to fill it a tall, somewhat slight man
with a mild but chipper voice, who had a long, outstanding exec
utive experience at the University—Dr. Ernest R. Hilgard.
Dr. Hilgard moved up from executive head of the Psychology

Department, which he had been<
since 1942 (with time out for the
government during the war, 1942-
44), to assume a multitude of official
duties as the new dean.
Adding them up, he is first of all
chairman of the Graduate Study
Committee, which sets the stand
ards for, organizes, and has overall
supervision over the program ol
graduate study at Stanford.
To Hilgard falls the job of being
dean of the various interdepart
mental programs—Hoover Library,
Microwave Lab, and Food Research
Institute among others.
Further, he is the administra
tion's representative in research
projects. All the University re
search contracts channel through
his office for review. This little
item involves some $1!,500,000 a
year income for Stanford, more
than the endowment brings in.
Add acting as executive director
for the Committee on Research in
the Social Sciences, which is ad
ministering a $100,000 Ford Founda
tion grant.
More still, his office handles the
fellowship, scholarship, and grant
in-aid program for graduate stu
dents.
Dean Ililgard smiles a little
sheepishly and adds, "It's not so
much. I'm still teaching Psych 51
and reading proof on my introduc
tory text for psychology. 1 hope
Stanford will adopt it."
Finally, he is collaborating on a
very interesting project for the Of
fice ol Naval Research: "Problem
,Solving in Thinking."
in this, the researchers are using,
among other things, the "20 ques
tion game" to find out how the mind
works in solving problems.
Born in Illinois in 1004, the 48-
year-old dean won a B.S. in chemi
cal engineering at the University of
Illinois before he became interested
in psychology.
Psych took him to Yale for doc
toral study and romance. He re
ceived his Ph.D. in 19.'t0 and came
to Stanford, bringhig with him a
wife met at Yale, where she also
earned a Ph.D. in psychology.
He moved steadily up in the
Psych Department to become its

head. Honors include, among many,
the Warren Medal for experimental
psychology in 1940 and election to
the National Academy of Sciences
in 1948, where he joined two other
Stanford psychologists, Dr. Calvin
P. Stone and Dr. L. M. Terman.
"At home my wife and I are
pretty average people, I guess," he
says, eyes twinkling. "We play with
the children (son, 15, and daughter,
eight), and work around the house
without any complicated hobbies."
"In fact, my son upbraids me
far not being an expert in any
thing I don't get paid for. But let
me tell you about my wife," he
puts in eagerly.
Mrs. Hilgard, Josephine Rohrs
Hilgard, Ph.D., M.D., went on to
study medicine at Stanford Lane
after her psych work at Yale, on
the theory that husband and wife
should not have the same occupa
tion.
Today, in addition to being a
homemaker and wife, she is a prac
ticing psychoanalyst and assistant
professor of medicine in neuropsy
chiatry at Stanford Medical School.
They're quite a pair.

works in solving problems.
Born in Illinois in 1004, the 48-
year-old dean won a B.S. in chemi

Psych took him to Yale for doc

ceived his Ph.D. in 19.'t0 and came
to Stanford, bringhig with him a
wife met at Yale, where she also
earned a Ph.D. in psychology.
He moved steadily up in the
Psych Department to become its

head. Honors include, among many,
the Warren Medal for experimental
psychology in 1940 and election to
the National Academy of Sciences
in 1948, where he joined two other
Stanford psychologists, Dr. Calvin
P. Stone and Dr. L. M. Terman.
"At home my wife and I are
pretty average people, I guess," he
says, eyes twinkling. "We play with
the children (son, 15, and daughter,
eight), and work around the house
without any complicated hobbies."
"In fact, my son upbraids me
far not being an expert in any
thing I don't get paid for. But let
me tell you about my wife," he
puts in eagerly.
Mrs. Hilgard, Josephine Rohrs
Hilgard, Ph.D., M.D., went on to
study medicine at Stanford Lane
after her psych work at Yale, on
the theory that husband and wife
should not have the same occupa
tion.
Today, in addition to being a
homemaker and wife, she is a prac
ticing psychoanalyst and assistant
professor of medicine in neuropsy
chiatry at Stanford Medical School.
They're quite a pair.
