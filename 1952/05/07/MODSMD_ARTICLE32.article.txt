Hogarth prints will be exhibited
and discussed by Henry A. Bamman
before the monthly meeting of the
Stanford Distaff Club at 8 tonight

largest collections of Hogarth prints
in the United States. Forty-two of
these prints, which are originals from
the copper engravings, will be on
exhibit.

Club officers for next year will be
elected following the report of the
Nominating Committee. Members of
the Committee are Lillian Owen,
Chairman, Florine Mcintosh, and
Armista Cook, with Mrs. Harvey
