Cap and Gown is a uniquely
Stanford honor society, begun
here in l!Jofi. It is not affiliated

with any national honor group,
though Mortar Board members
are welcomed to its meetings.
Cap and Gown's main purpose is
to give women who are active in
University life a chance to get to
gether and compare notes. Accord
ing to the .story, the need for a
group like this was seen in 190l>
by three women sitting on u fence:
Hazel Pedlar Faulkner, Alice Hayes
Chalmers, pnd Edith Mirrielees. The
earthquake delayed formation of
the society till the following year.
A major Cap and Gown activity is
selling calendars to raise funds lor
its scholarship fund. Besides aiding
an undergraduate each year, the
society has brought a foreign .schol
ar to Stanford each year since 19-18.
Lieselotte Trischkat, an education
senior from Germany, is this year's
Cap and Gown scholar.
Cap and Gown also has an ac
tive group of alumnae. These in
clude honorary members—faculty
or other women in the Stanford
community who have given out
standing service.
