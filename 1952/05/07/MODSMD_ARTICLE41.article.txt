### JIM MADISON 
Dirpf.'tor of Athletics Al Masters
has '.en I to President Sterling a
written memorandum saying that
"lor the next live years it. will prob
ably be necessary to work out cuts
in the overall athletic program."
What any such cuts will involve
specifically, il made, i.s a problem
still to be worked out; but Masters
indicated that paring may be done
all along the line in staff, size of
squads, scheduling, and frosh com
petition.
The overall athletic policy of try
ing to get as many men out and into
competition as possible will be main
tained.
One thing was made certain by
the memo: the inability of the Uni
versity to add crew to its program.
Figures ol the 1952-53 athletic

| budget furnish ample evidence for
: the SAB's action as well as for Mas
i ters' recommendation.
Income for the next fiscal year is
estimated at $511,200 and expenses
.at $551,895, leaving a deficit of
$40,695.
It is recommended that part of
the Rose Bowl money be allocated
I to cover the deficit, the remainder
going into badly needed capital
maintenance to the athletic plant.
"With inflation of costs and soft
ening of athletics at the gate, the
picture for succeeding years looks
a little dark," Masters went on.
He reasoned that a Rose Bowl
will not come along every year, and
that obviously athletics cannot op
erate on a continuing deficit; hence
the SAB decision on crew and his
recommendation to the president.
