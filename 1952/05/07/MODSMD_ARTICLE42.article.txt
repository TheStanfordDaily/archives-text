The Stanford Varsity Tennis team upset USC a few weeks back. It was
the fust time such a thing has happened in a decade.
Our curiosity was aroused. VVe wondered how good Stanford tennis
has I,cen fn the past. The man to ask was Intramural Commissioner
Elvvyn LSugge, who has been with the Stanford Department of Athletics
since 1!>28.
'1 lie former director of tennis and current intramural director by his
request was more than willing to help out. In fact his report was so
detailed and complete that this morning we can only present exerpts.
Termis at Stanford, prior to 1920, was highlighted by individual rather
than team eftort. It wasn't until 1920 that, through the efforts of Phil
Neer and Jim Davis, both Varsity players, that the student body voted
better than 4 ot ] to make Farm tennis a varsity sport.
One ol the greatest moments in Stanford tennis history occurred in the
summer of 1924. Upon invitation of the Australian government Stanford
sent a lour-man squad to the L«'>nd-down-under. In seventeen exhibition
matches played the Indian quartet won twelve and did much to spread
the Stanford name.
INCREASING SKILL
The records and statistics of the period from 1925 indicate that Stanford
started to climb the long ladder of tennis success in 1925 by whipping the
Bear squad and reached the top rung in 1942.
The year 1942 is the one that stands out in the history of Stanford
t< nnis. This was the last season of Indian tennis greatness and it should
he a long time before there is another to equal it.
Following capture of all Conference matches, the Card squad of Larry
Dee, Jimmy Wade, Emery Neale and Ted Schroeder travelled to North
western University for the National Intercollegiate championships.
And what Stanford did will never be forgotten. Indian men laced each
other in both the finals of the singles and the doubles. In singles the now
lamous Ted Schroeder won from mate Larry Dee. In doubles these two
teamed to whip their teammates, Wade and Neale.
Mr. Bugge has done his part, what follows is our doing. Schroeder
rlor:ed his college career later that summer by winning the U.S. Singles
Title at Forest Hills defeating ace Frank Parker.
From 1942 to the present the tennis picture has not been the bright
er. However things are once more on the upswing. This year's squad
hud done well and appears a cinch for at least second place honors in
the Southern Division race. The Initios even have an outside chance for
the title, provided they win their next three matches from USC, UCLA.
uudV'al and if UCLA knocks USC off in return and if, if, if.
COMEBACK IN SIGHT
But the coming years could see the renaissance of Stanford tennis.
Coming back fiom this year's team are five of the first six, namely Charlie
llickox, Bob Sibert, Art Fish, Gary Gray and Jim Cornish. Only Tom
L( wyn graduates. George Stewart will be up from the Junior Varsity.
In addition, there are two incoming frosh of note. One is Jack Frost,
who was National Boys Champ in '49. Along with Jack comes Don Thomp
son, who also has won his tennis laurels. Both are current top-ranking
Junior players.
The Stanford tennis team makes its last home stand of the season Fri
day, when they host an intruding San Jose State Squad. It's a good chance
to see this year's squad, the nucleus of next year's, and get a little sun
all in one afternoon.

Bear squad and reached the top rung in 1942.
The year 1942 is the one that stands out in the history of Stanford
t< nnis. This was the last season of Indian tennis greatness and it should
he a long time before there is another to equal it.
Following capture of all Conference matches, the Card squad of Larry
Dee, Jimmy Wade, Emery Neale and Ted Schroeder travelled to North
western University for the National Intercollegiate championships.
And what Stanford did will never be forgotten. Indian men laced each
other in both the finals of the singles and the doubles. In singles the now
lamous Ted Schroeder won from mate Larry Dee. In doubles these two
teamed to whip their teammates, Wade and Neale.
Mr. Bugge has done his part, what follows is our doing. Schroeder
rlor:ed his college career later that summer by winning the U.S. Singles
Title at Forest Hills defeating ace Frank Parker.
From 1942 to the present the tennis picture has not been the bright
er. However things are once more on the upswing. This year's squad
hud done well and appears a cinch for at least second place honors in
the Southern Division race. The Initios even have an outside chance for
the title, provided they win their next three matches from USC, UCLA.

COMEBACK IN SIGHT
But the coming years could see the renaissance of Stanford tennis.
Coming back fiom this year's team are five of the first six, namely Charlie
llickox, Bob Sibert, Art Fish, Gary Gray and Jim Cornish. Only Tom

who was National Boys Champ in '49. Along with Jack comes Don Thomp
son, who also has won his tennis laurels. Both are current top-ranking
Junior players.
The Stanford tennis team makes its last home stand of the season Fri
day, when they host an intruding San Jose State Squad. It's a good chance
to see this year's squad, the nucleus of next year's, and get a little sun
all in one afternoon.
The Stanford Varsity Tennis team upset USC a few weeks back. It was
the fust time such a thing has happened in a decade.
Our curiosity was aroused. VVe wondered how good Stanford tennis
has I,cen fn the past. The man to ask was Intramural Commissioner
Elvvyn LSugge, who has been with the Stanford Department of Athletics
since 1!>28.

request was more than willing to help out. In fact his report was so
detailed and complete that this morning we can only present exerpts.
Termis at Stanford, prior to 1920, was highlighted by individual rather

Neer and Jim Davis, both Varsity players, that the student body voted
better than 4 ot ] to make Farm tennis a varsity sport.
One ol the greatest moments in Stanford tennis history occurred in the
summer of 1924. Upon invitation of the Australian government Stanford

matches played the Indian quartet won twelve and did much to spread
the Stanford name.
