## Larry Cahn ... And in The Majors 
### 
As the major leagues move into
the third week of play, the National
League is again narrowing down to
the cross-town rival New York Gi
ants and Brooklyn Dodgers. In the
American loop the Red Sox from
Beantown still hold a game edge
over Cleveland,
Cincinnati anil Chicago, which
opened with much flurry in the
the senior circuit, are now slip
ping, are in third and fourth spots,
and have not played as many games
as the Dodgers and Giants. How
ever, their surprise start has given
unexpected color and excitement to
the Hag race.
Giants on Fire
The Giants, who openeJ slowly,
are now reverting to the form they
exhibited at the close of 1951. Leo
Durocher's gang are currently rid
ing the crest of a seven-game win
streak. And the surprise is that no
Giant is hitting over .3110 at this
early stage. Hurlers Larry Jansen
and Sal Maglie are largely respon
sible for the success.
However, pitching honors in the
National go to Gerry Staley of the
Cards, who has copped his first five
starts this year against no defeats.
,p sÂ»ck to that the five straight win
he hurled at the end of last season
and you have an impressive 10
straight win streak for the 29-year
old right-hander.
In the American, Boston is still
on top by a game, followed by
Cleveland. The Browns have slip
ped to fourth behind a surprise
Washington club. The Yanks are
right with the Browns.
Yanks Stabilized
The trade of the previously weak
hitting Jackie Jensen for good field
ing, fair hitting veteran outfielder
Irv Noren of Washington will help
stabilize a young Yank Club and
might be the inspiration the New
Yorkers need to move.
The loss of Yank Gerry Coleman
to the Marines at the time he was
leading the AL in batting is a tough
blow. . However, on paper it is no
tougher than Boston losing Ted
Williams. But somehow it seems
that the Red Sox should do better
without the bitter agitator Williams.
Nicman, Delsing Top Batters
Two Brown batters are currently
tied for the batting lead of the
American League. Bob Nieman and
Jim Delsing both are clubbing at a
.400 clip.
This week American League
clubs are still in the East with top
series finding Cleveland at New
York and Chicago at Boiton. In the
National, Cincinnati takes the test
against Brooklyn while the Giants
try to hold on against the Cards in
standout series.
