Village 308, behind the one-hil
hurling of Jim Mclndoe, nosed out
DKE I, 2-1, in a mural softball game
yesterday.
The game was a pitchers' duel all
the way with speedy Chris Colt
furnishing Mclndoe's oppo ition.
Cole allowed only two bluw, Lot!i
singles, but they came at critical
times, figuring in both Village tal
lies.
The Village opened the scoring in
the bottom of the first when Kent
Hallawell raced home from third on
Mcln.'oe's towering fly to iefl. Hal
lawell had previously reached first
on a single to left, advancing on a
walk and a force play.
The Dekes tied it up in the top
of the third, despite the fact that
Mclndoe struck out the side. Jim
Thoinburn opened the inning by
reaching first after a swinging
strike three, when the umpire ruled
that the catcher hud deflected the
bat. After two more Dekes went
down swinging, Blair Pascoe drove
home the tying run witli a fluke
baseman, playing up close, mi-.sed

I ths ball when it took an unexpect
ed hit'h hop over his head, and i
trickled into left Held just out of
the reach of the shortstop backing
I up the paly.
Dick Beardsley, however, opened
i.he la?t of the third with another
Single for the Villagers. Advancing
to hecond on a walk to Dick Maltz
man, Beardj.ley came all the way
home when the Deke catcher, Mike
lager, overthrew third on an at
tempted steal.
Mclndoe struck out four in facing
17 batters over the lour frames. The
j tjaine marked the third straight tri
j umph for Village 30H.
