# Dr. Burchardt Says Britain's Task Difficult
## 
### HARRY GLAZE 
"Throughout the post-war period
Britain has tried to do too much
and has strained her resources. But
even in doing too much, she has
done too little in comparison to the
task to be done."
This is how Dr. Frank A. Bur
chardt, visiting professor of eco
nomics from Oxford, characterized
Britain's economic situation at last
night's Tuesday Evening Series lec
ture in Memorial Auditorium.
"Britain is not yet standing on her
feet for two reasons," he explained.
"The first is the structural damage
inflicted on the British economy
during the war. Also British econ
omy has failed to promote maxi
mum recovery and stability. The
ends of economic policy as well as
the means are controversial."
Dr. Burchardt listed four main
aims in bringing the British econ
omy up to its pre-war status: in
creasing consumption, reconstruct
ing and modifying production
equipment, rebuilding the export
market, and improving the financial
position.
He emphasized that there is no
quick way out. The remedy for
each crisis must rest on its nature
and setting.
Economic controls have been
kept bccausc the British Relieved
that an automatic release of con
trols after the war would have
brought much more intense infla
tion thef'e than in the United
States. The theory was to ease
inflationary pressures off gradu
ally.
"In policy there is the conflict, be
tween maintaining internal stability
and balancing accounts with other
countries," he commented,
