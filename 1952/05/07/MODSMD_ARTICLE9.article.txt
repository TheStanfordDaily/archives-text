# Two Students Get Fâ€™s For Violations of Honor Code
## 
### 
Two students were found guilty
of Honor Code violations at. last
night's meeting of the Council for
Student Control. Each student was
penalized with an "F" in the course ;
in which the violation occurred.
The first case tried by the corn- I
bined Men's and Women s Councils j
involved a violation in an English |
theme. The student had para
phrased sections of a dictionary.
The Council felt, however, that the
intent was not serious enough to
warrant suspension, said Drew Ter
ramorse, chairman.
In the second case, also concern
ing an English theme, the student
admitted that he was guilty. He
pleaded, however, that he did not
realize that it would be a viola
tion at the time, and that he had
no wilful intention of deceiving.
The Council ayain found that len

iency was in order, and assigned the
penalty of an "F" in the course.
The two councils will meet, next
week to discuss ami clarify hsues
of the Fundamental Standard.
