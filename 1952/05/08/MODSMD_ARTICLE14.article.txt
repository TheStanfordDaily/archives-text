# Government Plea Ignored By Strikers

### 
DENVER, Colo., May 7 (UP)â€”
The nation's 00,000 striking oil
workers tonight turned down a
government plea to return to
their jobs and a spokesman ac
cused the Wage Stabilization
Board of causing a breakdown
in negotiations.
The action, which came at a time
when gasoline rationing was being
put into effect in the midwest, was
expected to cause the dispute to be
tossed into President Truman's lap.
O. A. Knight, president of the oil
workers international union (CIO),
announced at a televised press con
ference here that "we have no alter
native but to confine our strike."
He said he was speaking for all of
the 22 CIO, AFL, and independent
unions involved in the strike which
began at 12:01 a.m. April 30.
Earlier today, Knight had an
nounced that an agreement had been
reached with the defense department
on procedures to keep essential oil
products flowing to the armed serv
ices after all branches of the military
had announced that the strike was
forcing them to curtail training pro
grams.
The strike already had resulted in
voluntary rationing being set up in
Toledo, Ohio, and in Chicago city
officials met with union and com
pany representatives today to set up
a form of rationing. However, the
meeting broke up without agree
ment.
