## Credit Restrictions On Consumer Goods Lifted 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 7 (UP) The government today suspend
ed all credit restrictions on automobiles, TV sets, furniture, and
other consumer durable goods, effective immediately.
The action by the Federal Reserve Board leaves customers and
retailers free to write their own tickets as to down payments and

installment terms on items previ
ously controlled by Regulation "W,"
the regulation that was suspended.
The Reserve Board said its action
was prompted by the general eco
nomic outlook and conditions in the
merchandising field. But it threat
ened to slap the curbs back on
again if conditions change.
The regulation first was imposed
in September, 1950, under author
ity granted by Congress after the
outbreak of the fighting in Korea
set ofT a sharp inflationary spiral.
The Board ha; credited it with a
major assist in the task of curbing
high prices.
In suspending the credit controls,
the Reserve Board emphasized that
it was asking Congre-s to continue
the basic law under which they
were imposed. This would enable it
to restore the controls if inflation
again threatened to get out of hand.
