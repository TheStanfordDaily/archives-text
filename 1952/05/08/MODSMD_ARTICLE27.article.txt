# Excom Tackles $33,000 Proposed 52-53 Budget
## Most Groups' Requests Met 
### 
In the longest and best at-
I tended meeting of the yeai, Ex
com last night tackled next year's
J $33,000 proposed ASSU budget,
i only to get bogged down with
certain specific issues.
By 11:40 p.m., the Executive Com
mittee had yet to examine nearly
$5,000 of the budget and give their
final approval to the entire proposal.
On the whole, most of the organiza
[ tional budgets examined up to that
time were accepted without question.
The finances for the Public Rela
tions Committee, the Debate Board,
and the Grants-In-Aid were all
questioned, due to their cuts from
the current year's budget. Public

Due to the extreme late hour of
the budget discussion, the ICvrom
approval of new members of Car
dinals, (he Foreign Scholarship
Committee, and (lie Men's Spon
| sors was not made in time for to
day's Daily. The approved mem
bers will he announced tomorrow.

J Relations Committee was given a
final budget cut of $110 from last
year's $475 allotment.
Two large proposed cuts from last
! year's budget—a $500 drop in the
Grants-in-Aid fund, and a $53-j cut
in the Debate Board allocation
were not conclusively decided upon
as Excom went into its fourth
straight hour of budget discussion.
The largest single allocation on
the budge! was that of the /VSSU
office and Student Organizations
Fund, given $7,500. The Foreign
Scholarship Committee's $5,360 was.
the gieatest single sum allocated
to a student organization.
Ihe presentation of the budget
was made by Student Manager
George Denny, and he provided clar
ification of the various allocation?
to the Excom members and the more
than 20 visitors.
By 11:40, only three changes had
been tentatively approved by Ex
com, as the final approval was to be
withheld until the entire budget
bad been considered. Those changes
| that were made affected the Public;
Relations Committee, the freshman
Pre - registration Committee, and
Cardinals.

In the midst of the serious budget
discussion, Excom was disrupted by
hooded raiders of the "Kon Home
Klan." The raiders, armed with
! water pistols doused the Excom
members while collecting over $12
for the Home. Cardinals members
Roy Alexander, Mcl Butler, Skip
Irving, Jim Mansfield, and Chuck
Malouf executed the raid.
