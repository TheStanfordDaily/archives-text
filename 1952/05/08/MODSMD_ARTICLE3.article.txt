# Cabinet Reshuffled
## 
### 
LONDON â€”Prime Minister Win
ston Churchill tonight removed his
Minister of Health in a cabinet re
shuffle apparently designed to head
off the rising time of unpopularity
which threatens hi.s Conservative
government.
It was the first cabinet shake-up
since Churchill returned to power
six months ago and came, signifi
cantly, in the midst of local elec
tions in which Labor party gains
were the measure of ground lost by
the Conservatives in that time.
