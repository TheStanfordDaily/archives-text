# About the Fundamental Standard

Is there something wrong with the Funda
mental Standard?
Criticism levelled last week at Women's
Council's action in a recent case and subse
quent criticism of an alleged lack of under
standing of the Standard point out that there is
a real need to ask this question.
We would reply that there is nothing wrong
with the Standard itself, but that it definitely
needs clarification. Education about the Stan
dard is also vitally needed.
Without a full knowledge of the facts, we
would not try to rule on the justice of the case
which originally prompted the criticism. But
we do feel that the persons who wrote the
letter to the editor are justified in asking for
a concrete definition of the Standard and a pre
cise explanation of the principles on which the
Council acts.
As things stand now, the Standard is com
paratively nebulous. Ereshmen learn that
David Starr Jordan said, "Students are ex
pected to show both within and without the
University such respect for order, morality,
personal honor, and the rights o/ ethers as is
demanded ol good citizens. Eailure to do this
will be suificient cause tor removal from the
University."
But one can imagine a student who knew no
more about the Standard than this coming be
fore the Council charged with a particular
crime. Though the Council could prove that
the person had committed this crime, he could
defend himself by saying, "But I did not feel
that this act war; a violation of the Fundamental
Standard."

The scene verges on the ridiculous, but
without a concrete definition of the kind of con
duct the Standard implies, such a basic mis
understanding of terms is possible.
The positions cA both Men's and Women's
Councils would be aided it their aims were
made more public. Misunderstandings might
well be avoided it the councils would tully ex
plain their decisions and the standards they
used to arrive at these decisions.
A lesser known side of the picture is that
both Fundamental Standard Committee and
Women's Council realize something is needed
and are working hard to improve the situation.
For example, the two groups recently prepared
a poll on "Application of the Fundamental
Standard to Social Regulations." It was dis
tributed to women's living groups, and the re
sults from it should be released next week.
Women's Council also plans to talk to living
groups about their job and the standards they
use in performing it.
Fundamental Standard Committee is cur
rently drafting general statements ot the con
duct the Standard implies. After approval by
Excom, these statements will go into a social
conduct booklet v/hich will be distributed to
every person who enters Stanford.
These groups- to whom the Student Body
has assigned the task of interpreting the Stan
dard—are doing their part. The result should
be some worthwhile changes in a situation
which seems to us well in need of correction.
