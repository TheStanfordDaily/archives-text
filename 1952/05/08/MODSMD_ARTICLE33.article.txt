# BULL SESSION
## FRUSTRATION... 
### DICK McLEAN 
Life seems filled to the brim with conflicts. Nations
battle nations, sections war with sections, individuals
fight with their neighbors. But of all conflicts the
worst and most bloody — like civil wars — are the
struggles within self.
For every drive within the body there exists an
equal and opposite drive. Thus is the soul plagued:
"Should I eat today or be thin tomorrow?" '"Should
I have fun while I'm young or be rich when I'm old?"
Ail day, everyday, constant conflict.
Here in play form is an illustration of this battle.
FRUSTRATION
(A PSYCHOLOGICAL DRAMA)
ACT I
The scene: A ravaged soul.
The characters: Conscience and Inclination. Which
one is villian and which is hero is a choice that
you, the reader, must make.
The time: That time of the morning when bed is
its warmest and dreams their sweetest. The
time telling device beside the bed trembles
momentarily then explodes in shimmering
waves of sound.

CONSCIENCE: Come on, wake
up. You've got to go to class.
INCLINATION: I think I'll turn
off the alarm and doze a few
minutes. 1 won't go back to
sleep.
CONSCIENCE: Like hell you
won't. Get up.
INCLINATION: I'm sick. Yes,
I m sure I am. My cold took
a definite turn for the worse
last night and 112 think I should
stay in bed for my health.

CONSCIENCE: Poor baby! Get up. You've cut too
many classes already.
INCLINATION: Then one more won't count.
CONSCIENCE: Arise and shine, Morning Glory.
( The conscience ridden lad drags his body from the
bed and tries to look out the window.)
IHILINATION: Hey! Who's that old guy with thp
whiskers staring in at me?
CONSCIENCE: That's you, Blue Beard. You're
looking into the mirror.

INCLINATION: I don't have to shave. I can cover
my fact* with poison oak lotion and tell people that
I can't shave.
CONSCIENCE: People will ask how and with whom
you got the poison oak.
INCLINATION: But I'm liable to cut my throat shav
ing when I'm so sleepy.
CONSCIENCE: You can tell the folks that the cuts
are from a sword fight. Come on, Cyrano, end the
refrain, insert the blade, and thrust home. (The
youth muddles up a frothing lioul of lather while
wondering if he should shave under the hags around
his eves or over them. He takes the high road and
shaves oil his eyebrows by mistake.)
ACT II
The scene: A dough faced lad with no eyebrows
:<tands in the doorway of a classroom. He is
trying to reach a decision. Only two seats re
main: one is in the first row between two
graduate students, the other is in the last row
between the heater and the blonde foreign stu
dent from Paris.
INCLINATION: Oh boy! I'm going to be warm on
both sides.
CONSCIENCE: You should sit down front where
you can hear better.
INCLINATION: I'll sit in the back and lip read.
CONSCIENCE: If you're not going to pay attention,
there's no sense in even going to class.
INCLINATION: That's what I tried to tell you this
morning.
CONSCIENCE: Besides, she's probably pinned.
INCLINATION: I think I'll run up and check on it.
(The fellow starts up the aisle but the weasle faced
reader snakes by him toward Ihe seat next to the
long stemmed Parisian.)
CONSCIENCE: Hurray for weasle faced readers. I
guess lln't ends our argument. (The class begins.
The poor, trembling lad sits in the front row.)
Now pay attention.
INCLINATION: No. 1 won't pay attention. I'm going
to sleep.
CONSCIENCE: You can't do that. You w "'•••
INCLINATION: Goodbye, Conscience. Farewell.
(Thinly clad dancing maidens from the domain of
sleep surround the youth's soul in a cobweb of song
and bear him smilingly away.)

The scene: A dough faced lad with no eyebrows
:<tands in the doorway of a classroom. He is
trying to reach a decision. Only two seats re
main: one is in the first row between two
graduate students, the other is in the last row
between the heater and the blonde foreign stu
dent from Paris.
INCLINATION: Oh boy! I'm going to be warm on
both sides.
CONSCIENCE: You should sit down front where
you can hear better.
INCLINATION: I'll sit in the back and lip read.
CONSCIENCE: If you're not going to pay attention,
there's no sense in even going to class.
INCLINATION: That's what I tried to tell you this
morning.
CONSCIENCE: Besides, she's probably pinned.
INCLINATION: I think I'll run up and check on it.
(The fellow starts up the aisle but the weasle faced
reader snakes by him toward Ihe seat next to the
long stemmed Parisian.)
CONSCIENCE: Hurray for weasle faced readers. I
guess lln't ends our argument. (The class begins.
The poor, trembling lad sits in the front row.)
Now pay attention.
INCLINATION: No. 1 won't pay attention. I'm going
to sleep.
CONSCIENCE: You can't do that. You w "'•••
INCLINATION: Goodbye, Conscience. Farewell.

sleep surround the youth's soul in a cobweb of song
and bear him smilingly away.)
The Curtain Slowly Descends

Life seems filled to the brim with conflicts. Nations
battle nations, sections war with sections, individuals
fight with their neighbors. But of all conflicts the
worst and most bloody — like civil wars — are the
struggles within self.
For every drive within the body there exists an
equal and opposite drive. Thus is the soul plagued:
"Should I eat today or be thin tomorrow?" '"Should
I have fun while I'm young or be rich when I'm old?"
Ail day, everyday, constant conflict.
Here in play form is an illustration of this battle.
FRUSTRATION
(A PSYCHOLOGICAL DRAMA)
ACT I
The scene: A ravaged soul.
The characters: Conscience and Inclination. Which
one is villian and which is hero is a choice that
you, the reader, must make.
The time: That time of the morning when bed is
its warmest and dreams their sweetest. The
time telling device beside the bed trembles
momentarily then explodes in shimmering
waves of sound.

CONSCIENCE: Come on, wake
up. You've got to go to class.
INCLINATION: I think I'll turn
off the alarm and doze a few
minutes. 1 won't go back to
sleep.
CONSCIENCE: Like hell you
won't. Get up.
INCLINATION: I'm sick. Yes,
I m sure I am. My cold took
a definite turn for the worse
last night and 112 think I should
stay in bed for my health.

CONSCIENCE: Poor baby! Get up. You've cut too
many classes already.
INCLINATION: Then one more won't count.
CONSCIENCE: Arise and shine, Morning Glory.
( The conscience ridden lad drags his body from the
bed and tries to look out the window.)
IHILINATION: Hey! Who's that old guy with thp
whiskers staring in at me?
CONSCIENCE: That's you, Blue Beard. You're
looking into the mirror.

INCLINATION: I don't have to shave. I can cover
my fact* with poison oak lotion and tell people that
I can't shave.
CONSCIENCE: People will ask how and with whom
you got the poison oak.
INCLINATION: But I'm liable to cut my throat shav
ing when I'm so sleepy.
CONSCIENCE: You can tell the folks that the cuts
are from a sword fight. Come on, Cyrano, end the
refrain, insert the blade, and thrust home. (The
youth muddles up a frothing lioul of lather while
wondering if he should shave under the hags around
his eves or over them. He takes the high road and
shaves oil his eyebrows by mistake.)

minutes. 1 won't go back to
sleep.
CONSCIENCE: Like hell you
won't. Get up.
INCLINATION: I'm sick. Yes,
I m sure I am. My cold took
a definite turn for the worse
last night and 112 think I should
stay in bed for my health.

CONSCIENCE: Poor baby! Get up. You've cut too
many classes already.
INCLINATION: Then one more won't count.
CONSCIENCE: Arise and shine, Morning Glory.
( The conscience ridden lad drags his body from the
bed and tries to look out the window.)
IHILINATION: Hey! Who's that old guy with thp
whiskers staring in at me?
CONSCIENCE: That's you, Blue Beard. You're
looking into the mirror.

INCLINATION: I don't have to shave. I can cover
my fact* with poison oak lotion and tell people that
I can't shave.
CONSCIENCE: People will ask how and with whom
you got the poison oak.
INCLINATION: But I'm liable to cut my throat shav
ing when I'm so sleepy.
CONSCIENCE: You can tell the folks that the cuts
are from a sword fight. Come on, Cyrano, end the
refrain, insert the blade, and thrust home. (The
youth muddles up a frothing lioul of lather while
wondering if he should shave under the hags around
his eves or over them. He takes the high road and
shaves oil his eyebrows by mistake.)
ACT II
The scene: A dough faced lad with no eyebrows

trying to reach a decision. Only two seats re
main: one is in the first row between two
graduate students, the other is in the last row
between the heater and the blonde foreign stu
dent from Paris.
INCLINATION: Oh boy! I'm going to be warm on
both sides.
CONSCIENCE: You should sit down front where
you can hear better.
INCLINATION: I'll sit in the back and lip read.
CONSCIENCE: If you're not going to pay attention,
there's no sense in even going to class.
INCLINATION: That's what I tried to tell you this
morning.
CONSCIENCE: Besides, she's probably pinned.
INCLINATION: I think I'll run up and check on it.
(The fellow starts up the aisle but the weasle faced
reader snakes by him toward Ihe seat next to the
long stemmed Parisian.)
CONSCIENCE: Hurray for weasle faced readers. I
guess lln't ends our argument. (The class begins.
The poor, trembling lad sits in the front row.)
Now pay attention.
INCLINATION: No. 1 won't pay attention. I'm going
to sleep.
CONSCIENCE: You can't do that. You w "'•••
INCLINATION: Goodbye, Conscience. Farewell.
(Thinly clad dancing maidens from the domain of
sleep surround the youth's soul in a cobweb of song
and bear him smilingly away.)
