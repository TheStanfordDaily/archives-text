## 
### 
.SEATTLE-Superior Judge Rob
ert M Jones today ruled that left
wing baritone Paul Robeson should
be permitted to sing at the Seattle
Civic Auditorium, despite objec
tions of city officials.
The contract with People's Pro
grams, Inc., sponsors of Robeson's
appearance here, was repudiated by
the city last month after it was dis
covered that Robeson was the main
attraction.
The judge ruled that the city had
not proved there would be "a haz
ard as the result of Robeson's ap
pearance here.
