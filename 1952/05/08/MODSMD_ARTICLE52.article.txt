# Trackmen Prep for Relays
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
Stafford's track aspirants, look
ing forward to this Saturday's Fres
no Relays, were forced to take ii
easy on the wet practice field. The
rain held up the relatively heavy
workouts that were scheduled for
yesterday.
The coming Fresno and Modesto
Relays will once again pit those
arch-rivals of the turf, Stanford and
USC, the terrible Trojans. In the
relays as in everything else it looks
like the same old story—too much
Troy and in the right places.
The high hurdles should be the
best of the day, any day. SC's Jack
Davis, last year's national champ,
will fae the versatile Mr. Robert
Mathias for the first time this sea
son. Both have posted official sea
sonal bests of :14.3 and tied for
top in the nation at present.
Besides the conventional 120-
yard high hurdles, the 100 - yard
dash and all the field events will
be run off as regular. It is in the
field events that Stanford and SC
should run off with the meets. SC
should take first, second, and third
in the high jump, one, two, and a
possible third in the pole vault, and
a first in both the discus and shot
put.

( Stanford's team of Hertz an I Ho
, kanson should come in a close rec
i ond and third in the shot, while
Bob Mathias and Chuck Renfro
should come in in the • ame order
in the discus. In the javelin, it will
once more be Stanford's team of
Leo Long, Bo!) Kimball, and Chuck
Harlow vs. Cal's Sam Adams and
George Roseme.
The relays, on whiuh the brunt
of the points rests, wiil include the
440-yard and Buo-yard relay teams,
the medley, two - mile relay, and
mile relay.
