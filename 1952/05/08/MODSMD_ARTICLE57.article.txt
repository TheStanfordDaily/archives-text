# Walsh Will Play Pro Ball; Rammer-AAU
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
Providing a draft board is will- j
ing, it is very possible that Stan
lord wdl have a second performer
in the p!ay-for-pay basketball ranks
next season.
At a meeting of the National Bas
ketball Association last week, the
Baltimore Bullets drafted Jim
Walsh, while the Fort Wayne Zoll
ner Pistons said they wanted Jim
Kamstea'!.
The Hammer has so fur indicated
that he isn't interested in pro ball,
but Walsh, the third highest scorer
in all Stanford basketball history
with 904 points, has expressed a
veiy definite willingness to play
with the Bullets.
"This is a great honor," Walsh
said. "If lias always been my life
long ambition as an athlete. If
my draft board is willing, I'll go
back Last and attend grad school
while I'm playing."
Jim, if he does play for Baltimore,
will be the third Stanfordite eager
to join the pro game. Jim Pollard
and Howie Dallmar, stars of Stan
ford's 1942 NCAA champs, played
lor the Minneapolis Lakers and the
Philadelphia Warriors, respectively.
Pollard, teaming the likes of
George Mikan, has been a member
of a quintet which has taken the
pro title four out of five years,
while Dallmar quit the game several
years back to become the head bas
ketball coach at Penn.
If Jim joins (he Bullets, he will
he playing with several other
players who are v< :y familiar to
Bay Area casaha fans. Baltimore's
stars include Don Barksdale, who
performed for UCLA and the
Oakland Bine and Golds; Frank
Kudelka, high - scoring forward
from St. Mary's, and Fred Scu
tari, who was with the Santa
Clara Broncos.
Ever since the G-ft. 3-in., 185-lb.,
all-city prep from St. James High in
San Francisco came to the Farm
four years ago, he has been a bas
ketball fixture. The hard - driving
Irishman, noted for his hustle and
deadly jump shot, immediately
stepped into the starting lineup of
the Indian frosh five and, through
the rest of his college days, he
never failed to start a contest —a
total of nearly a hundred games.
Jim has come in for plenty of ac
colades while playing for the Cardi
nal and White. As a sophomore and
junior, Walsh was on the
All-PCC second team. However, in
his final season, Jim was selected as
a guard on the first quintet.

Probably the highest award, how- |
ever, that Jim has ever received
was not an all-team selection. It
was a compliment paid by bis coach, j
Bob Burnett, at a weekly meeting of
the Northern California Basketball
Writer.,' and Sportcastei s' Associa
tion. Jim bad ju.->l been picked the
Bay Area Player of the Week for
his work against 'Cal.
Burnett characterized him as thel
type of player who makes coaching [
easy.
Jim has (hat inL.i e desire to j
play basketball, tvt'i\\ minute of j
every game. Sic never let-, down,
regardless of the score."
Jiin Ram .tead, although so far |
expressing no ile are to play pro j
ball, was a I.SO one of the outstanding
court performers in Indian history.
He ranks as the second higlie t
scorer in Stanford annals. His 1 J92
points lall only behind lite humor- |
tal Hank Lubetti.
The Rammer, as tl.e angular,
(i-fl. fi-iii. captain of fins year's
Card quintet is affectionately
known, is also a product of Sail
Francisco, where lie was an all
city performer for Lincoln Ili.'li.
At Stanford, in his Inst two years
of varsity plav he achieved only
honorable mention on the All-
PCC teams. However, in his sen
ior year, Jim was picked as the
center on the ('(inference first

team and was selected Northern <
California Player of the Year. He
capped this brilliant season by
playing in the East-West senior
gain'J at Kansas City.
Jim h;»i said he plans to continue
studying x*t the Stanford Business j
School. LV will still play basket
ball, but n*ost likely with the Oak- ;
land Atlas Pacific Engineers of the
National Industrial Basketball
League. Jim Splayed with the Engi
neer live at tilt* AAU championships
ut Denver last March.
Burnett has .'also words of praise
for his center i'/id team captain of
last season's hi\h - scoring live.
When the final giime of the reason 1

with Cul was over and the players
had wearily returned to the dress
ing room, Bob went around to each
man and expressed his appreciation
for their fine play over the season.
When he uot to Ramstead, he said
very simply, "Jim, you've had a
Kri-al season. The best of luck to
you, kid. When I have my children,
I'd like them to lie something like
you."
No matter whether the two
"Jim's" play pro ball or not, every
one at Stanford can certainly feel
proud of them.

with the Bullets.
"This is a great honor," Walsh
said. "If lias always been my life
long ambition as an athlete. If
my draft board is willing, I'll go
back Last and attend grad school
while I'm playing."
Jim, if he does play for Baltimore,
will be the third Stanfordite eager
to join the pro game. Jim Pollard
and Howie Dallmar, stars of Stan
ford's 1942 NCAA champs, played
lor the Minneapolis Lakers and the
Philadelphia Warriors, respectively.
Pollard, teaming the likes of
George Mikan, has been a member
of a quintet which has taken the
pro title four out of five years,
while Dallmar quit the game several
years back to become the head bas
ketball coach at Penn.
If Jim joins (he Bullets, he will
he playing with several other
players who are v< :y familiar to
Bay Area casaha fans. Baltimore's
stars include Don Barksdale, who
performed for UCLA and the
Oakland Bine and Golds; Frank
Kudelka, high - scoring forward
from St. Mary's, and Fred Scu
tari, who was with the Santa
Clara Broncos.
Ever since the G-ft. 3-in., 185-lb.,
all-city prep from St. James High in
San Francisco came to the Farm
four years ago, he has been a bas
ketball fixture. The hard - driving
Irishman, noted for his hustle and
deadly jump shot, immediately
stepped into the starting lineup of
the Indian frosh five and, through
the rest of his college days, he
never failed to start a contest —a
total of nearly a hundred games.
Jim has come in for plenty of ac
colades while playing for the Cardi
nal and White. As a sophomore and
junior, Walsh was on the
All-PCC second team. However, in
his final season, Jim was selected as
a guard on the first quintet.

Probably the highest award, how- |
ever, that Jim has ever received
was not an all-team selection. It
was a compliment paid by bis coach, j
Bob Burnett, at a weekly meeting of
the Northern California Basketball
Writer.,' and Sportcastei s' Associa
tion. Jim bad ju.->l been picked the
Bay Area Player of the Week for
his work against 'Cal.
Burnett characterized him as thel
type of player who makes coaching [
easy.
Jim has (hat inL.i e desire to j
play basketball, tvt'i\\ minute of j
every game. Sic never let-, down,
regardless of the score."
Jiin Ram .tead, although so far |
expressing no ile are to play pro j
ball, was a I.SO one of the outstanding
court performers in Indian history.
He ranks as the second higlie t
scorer in Stanford annals. His 1 J92
points lall only behind lite humor- |
tal Hank Lubetti.
The Rammer, as tl.e angular,
(i-fl. fi-iii. captain of fins year's
Card quintet is affectionately
known, is also a product of Sail
Francisco, where lie was an all
city performer for Lincoln Ili.'li.
At Stanford, in his Inst two years
of varsity plav he achieved only
honorable mention on the All-
PCC teams. However, in his sen
ior year, Jim was picked as the
center on the ('(inference first

team and was selected Northern <
California Player of the Year. He
capped this brilliant season by
playing in the East-West senior
gain'J at Kansas City.
Jim h;»i said he plans to continue
studying x*t the Stanford Business j
School. LV will still play basket
ball, but n*ost likely with the Oak- ;
land Atlas Pacific Engineers of the
National Industrial Basketball
League. Jim Splayed with the Engi
neer live at tilt* AAU championships
ut Denver last March.
Burnett has .'also words of praise
for his center i'/id team captain of
last season's hi\h - scoring live.
When the final giime of the reason 1

with Cul was over and the players
had wearily returned to the dress
ing room, Bob went around to each
man and expressed his appreciation
for their fine play over the season.
When he uot to Ramstead, he said
very simply, "Jim, you've had a
Kri-al season. The best of luck to
you, kid. When I have my children,
I'd like them to lie something like
you."
No matter whether the two
"Jim's" play pro ball or not, every
one at Stanford can certainly feel
proud of them.

of a quintet which has taken the
pro title four out of five years,
while Dallmar quit the game several
years back to become the head bas
ketball coach at Penn.
If Jim joins (he Bullets, he will
he playing with several other
players who are v< :y familiar to
Bay Area casaha fans. Baltimore's
stars include Don Barksdale, who
performed for UCLA and the
Oakland Bine and Golds; Frank
Kudelka, high - scoring forward
from St. Mary's, and Fred Scu
tari, who was with the Santa
Clara Broncos.
Ever since the G-ft. 3-in., 185-lb.,
all-city prep from St. James High in
San Francisco came to the Farm
four years ago, he has been a bas
ketball fixture. The hard - driving
Irishman, noted for his hustle and
deadly jump shot, immediately
stepped into the starting lineup of
the Indian frosh five and, through
the rest of his college days, he
never failed to start a contest —a
total of nearly a hundred games.
Jim has come in for plenty of ac
colades while playing for the Cardi
nal and White. As a sophomore and
junior, Walsh was on the
All-PCC second team. However, in
his final season, Jim was selected as
a guard on the first quintet.

Probably the highest award, how- |
ever, that Jim has ever received
was not an all-team selection. It
was a compliment paid by bis coach, j
Bob Burnett, at a weekly meeting of
the Northern California Basketball
Writer.,' and Sportcastei s' Associa
tion. Jim bad ju.->l been picked the
Bay Area Player of the Week for
his work against 'Cal.
Burnett characterized him as thel
type of player who makes coaching [
easy.
Jim has (hat inL.i e desire to j
play basketball, tvt'i\\ minute of j
every game. Sic never let-, down,
regardless of the score."
Jiin Ram .tead, although so far |
expressing no ile are to play pro j
ball, was a I.SO one of the outstanding
court performers in Indian history.
He ranks as the second higlie t
scorer in Stanford annals. His 1 J92
points lall only behind lite humor- |
tal Hank Lubetti.
The Rammer, as tl.e angular,
(i-fl. fi-iii. captain of fins year's
Card quintet is affectionately
known, is also a product of Sail
Francisco, where lie was an all
city performer for Lincoln Ili.'li.
At Stanford, in his Inst two years
of varsity plav he achieved only
honorable mention on the All-
PCC teams. However, in his sen
ior year, Jim was picked as the
center on the ('(inference first

team and was selected Northern <
California Player of the Year. He
capped this brilliant season by
playing in the East-West senior
gain'J at Kansas City.
Jim h;»i said he plans to continue
studying x*t the Stanford Business j
School. LV will still play basket
ball, but n*ost likely with the Oak- ;
land Atlas Pacific Engineers of the
National Industrial Basketball
League. Jim Splayed with the Engi
neer live at tilt* AAU championships
ut Denver last March.
Burnett has .'also words of praise
for his center i'/id team captain of
last season's hi\h - scoring live.
When the final giime of the reason 1

with Cul was over and the players
had wearily returned to the dress
ing room, Bob went around to each
man and expressed his appreciation
for their fine play over the season.
When he uot to Ramstead, he said
very simply, "Jim, you've had a
Kri-al season. The best of luck to
you, kid. When I have my children,
I'd like them to lie something like
you."
No matter whether the two
"Jim's" play pro ball or not, every
one at Stanford can certainly feel
proud of them.
Providing a draft board is will- j
ing, it is very possible that Stan
lord wdl have a second performer
in the p!ay-for-pay basketball ranks
next season.
At a meeting of the National Bas
ketball Association last week, the
Baltimore Bullets drafted Jim
Walsh, while the Fort Wayne Zoll
ner Pistons said they wanted Jim
Kamstea'!.
The Hammer has so fur indicated
that he isn't interested in pro ball,
but Walsh, the third highest scorer
in all Stanford basketball history
with 904 points, has expressed a
veiy definite willingness to play
with the Bullets.
"This is a great honor," Walsh
said. "If lias always been my life
long ambition as an athlete. If
my draft board is willing, I'll go
back Last and attend grad school
while I'm playing."
Jim, if he does play for Baltimore,
will be the third Stanfordite eager
to join the pro game. Jim Pollard
and Howie Dallmar, stars of Stan
ford's 1942 NCAA champs, played
lor the Minneapolis Lakers and the
Philadelphia Warriors, respectively.
