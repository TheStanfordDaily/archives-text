# Honor Code Is Misunderstood
## 
### 
More than 3,000 students
polled last quarter stood at the
botloni of the class when ques
tioned on Stanford's most
bragged about tradition, the
Honor Code. All of them knew

| vaguely that the code existed,
: but few wore sure of its exact
machinery.
Although only 0.5 per ccnt of
| those polled thought the code was
| not working at all, one-third did
J not know that violations should be
' reported directly to Men's and

Women's Councils. The Councils
are made up entirely of student
elected officers.
Most students answered correctly
that violations do not apply only to
written exams. All material used
for grading is subject to the code.
When in doubt, the professor should
be consulted.
About one - half wrongly be
lieved that faculty members are
on the committee that tries vio
lations. Men's and Women's
Councils try all Honor Code cases
without faculty supervision of
any kind.
Neither party to a trial submits
rebuttal evidence, contrary to what
jll but a small number of students
thought. In other words, each party
has only one chance to plead his
case.
Two - thirds of those polled did
not realize that penalties almost al
ways involve suspension. Penalties
on exams, however, are not neces
sarily heaviest.
The Honor Code Committee's
survey al o showed that the code
is often weakest when:
1. Finals count for more than
one - half the grade in a
course.
2. Enrollment is large In lecture
courses.
I!. Grades in military courses de
termine the student's future
status in school.
4. The same quiz is given in dif
f ere nt sections throughout
(lie day.
Students in small living groups
saw more violations than those in
large dorms.
The committee noticed a shift in
student opinion on take-home tests.
A survey made a few years ago
showed that students considered
take-home tesis a iourcp of many
violations. This year students
thought there was no more cheating
on these tests than on class-written
exams.
The committee was generally
pleased with student attitude to
ward the poll. The results of the
much - publicized UCLA poll last
year, which supposedly showed
wide-spread cheating on that cam
pus, cannot be considered valid be
cause most students failed to take
the survey seriously.
