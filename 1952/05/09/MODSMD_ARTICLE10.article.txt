# Army May Move Hospital to Village
## 
### 
The Army announced plans yes
terday to move Letterman General
Hospital, in the Presidio, outside
the critical San Francisco target
area. The former Dibble Army Hos
pital, now Stanford Village, is one
of the sites under consideration for
the relocation.
Major General Leonard D. Hea
ton, commander of Letterman, said
that the site had not yet been se
lected, and that Army engineers
were investigating 15 other spots
in the Bay Area besides the 130-
acre location in Menlo Park.
Fred Glover, assistant to Presi
dent Wallace Sterling, confirmed
that Army engineers had investi
gated the Village site, but current
reports indicate that the engineers
submitted a negative report recom
mending against relocation there.
The University lease on the Vil
lage from the government, limited
one year in length, will expire in
June. The University has, however,
applied for a continuation of the
lease. Business Manager Alf Bran
din reported that all indications are
that the continuation will go
through.
