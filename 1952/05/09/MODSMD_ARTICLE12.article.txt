## 
### HADLEY ROFF Daily Political Editor 
"Eisenhower meets the re
quirements needed to be presi
dent. Taft does not."
That is what Dr. Graham H.
Sluart, Stanford political scien
tist, emphasized when outlining
"Eisenhower's Foreign Policy Rnlc"
at an "I Like Ike" rally Wednesday
night in the Palo Alto Community
Center.
"America needs a president ex
perienced in foreign policj, one
willi good judgment who recog
nizes the U.S. as a world power and
who is willing to see that the
country plays that role," Dr. Stuart
asserted.
Stressing that the president is in
almost Complete control of foreign
policy, the mild mannered professor
said that, "the ejection of Taft would
be disastrous to American - Euro
pean relations."
Citing Sen. Robert Taft's record.
Dr. Stuart reported that ho voted
aaginst Marshall Plan, Selective
Service. Lend Lease, and gave only
"grudging assent" to the United
Nations.
Having spent nine months 'in
Europe last year, Dr. Stuart found
"an admiration and an enthusiasm
for Eisenhower never before
achieved by an American in Europe."
Again and again during the talk
the speaker claimed that "Taft can
not win."
He warned that if the Republicans
fail to win this year, it would mean
"the downfall of the party."
"With Dwiglit D. Eisenhower as

standard fie: rer, the Republicans I
will win." the professor declared*.
He explained that the indepen- j
dent vote will lie the vital factor in ;
determining the outcome of the j
election. "The independent
voter," he said, "likes Ike."
According to Dr. Stuart, the crucial
issue in the coming election will be '
foreign policy.
Referring to speeches made by the !
general, the professor indicated that
Eisenhower will continue the present
foreign policy.
"The general is for the United
Nations and against isolationism. !
lie's for a European army. How
ever, he is not in favor of unre- |

strained economic help for Europe.
||<- also favors progressive disarm
ament."
Dr. Stuart said that Eisenhower
has emphasized that "no country can
oermanent.!y carry others on its
back."
Of Asia, Dr. Stuart observed that
Eisenhower hesitates to outline
policy. Chiefly, hecau .<• General
Douglas Mac Arthur is a military col
league and the SHAPE commander
is not familiar with Asian politics.
To sum up Eisenhower's policy
role, Dr. Stuart quoted from a ' peecb
made by the general recently in
Europe.
Eisenhower sairt, "We must strive
to erect a w;iH of security for tin
free world behind which free in
stitutions can live, 'that wall must
lie inaiiituned rntil Communist
imperialism dies of its own in
herent eviis."
Last night's meeting was .spon
sored by the South Penin ula ' '
Like Ike" Club. More than |K0 per
sons filled the Children's Theater
of the Community Center.
At (he meeting it was decided
to forward a petition to the
Northern California offices of th"
"I IJltc Ike" movement to ask
what role ITenhmvrr backers
should play in the .lime primary.
It was suggested hy Joseph Par
ker of Atherton. member of the lo
cal club's executive committee, that
Ike supporters should cast ballot >
for Governor Earl Warren in the
primary. It was felt that Warren
might throw his delegates to Eisen
hower at the GOP convention this
July.
A film picturing Eisenhower's ca
reer was shown.
