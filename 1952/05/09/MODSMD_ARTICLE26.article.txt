# Deanmen Face Crucial Games
## Broncos Today; Cal Tomorrow 
### PETE GROTHE 
IJverett Dean's men of
diamond, victorious in their last
six CIBA contests, will tie into
Santa Clara this afternoon in
their last home league game and
then travel to Berkeley for h
double header with Cal tomoi
row.
Today's tiff is slated for 3:15 p.m.;
tomorrow's twin bill gets under way
at 1:30.
Bob Murphy, tlio San Mateo
curve-baller, will toe the slab to
day in opposition to the Broncos'
Dick Camilli. The last time these
two met, Murphy hurled a one-hitter
and Camilli got off a three-hitter.
The Cards won, 3 to 0, on the
strength of Dick Corzine's three-run
homer.
Last Game With SC
This will be the last meeting of the
year between Santa Clara and Stan
ford. The Brones have yet to feel
the flush of victory in thres contests.
The Santa Clarans, led by first
baseman Gus Suhr, second sacker
Al Bertagna, and Camilli, will be
after sweet revenge.
Joe Chez and Rog Gsenbaugh will
go against Cal tomorrow. The Bears
are in the league basement, but are
very capable of upsetting those in
the penthouse, particularly in their
home grounds.
While the Indians are participating
in three league contests over the
weekend, the Trojans will only be in
two. USC, tied for first with Stan
ford, will meet Cal today and Santa
Clara tomorrow. Thus, the Indian:;
have a golden chance to forge ahead
of their hated rivals from Smoglarid.
Decider Next Week
The whole CIBA mess ends next
week when USC and Stanford meet
in two games in Los Angeles. To
the winner goes the spoils.
One of the most encouraging
aspects of Stanford's stretch drive ij
home run hitting of Charlie Esse
gian and the return to form of Jack
Shepard.
According to many old timers,
Shepard and Essegian are the most
lethal one-two punch in Stanford
history. Essegian, who came to Stan
ford via Menlo JC, was just another
outfielder last year.
Home-Run King
Then, this season all that latent
power of his came to the surface and
he began powering home runs out of
the sunken diamond with reckless
abandon. Twenty-three four masters
have been lost out of the Sunken
Diamond. Poker-faced Chuck has
collected eight of them. Twice, he
got two homers in one game. He ha,3
also blasted two home runs in other
parks. His all-over batting average
is .368.
Shepard, who plays right field,
first base, and catcher was the
scorge of the league last year and
the CIBA's leading sticker. He fell
into an early season slump, but
found his batting eye and is making
opposing pitchers sweat just as much
as they used to.
Other factors in Stanford's amaz
ing resurgc is Warren Goodrich's
batting (.327) and the return to form
of Joe Chez. Chez, the goodies man,
is the top hurler in the league with
a three and nothing record.

and Camilli got off a three-hitter.
The Cards won, 3 to 0, on the
strength of Dick Corzine's three-run
homer.
Last Game With SC
This will be the last meeting of the
year between Santa Clara and Stan
ford. The Brones have yet to feel
the flush of victory in thres contests.
The Santa Clarans, led by first
baseman Gus Suhr, second sacker
Al Bertagna, and Camilli, will be
after sweet revenge.
Joe Chez and Rog Gsenbaugh will
go against Cal tomorrow. The Bears
are in the league basement, but are
very capable of upsetting those in
the penthouse, particularly in their
home grounds.
While the Indians are participating
in three league contests over the
weekend, the Trojans will only be in
two. USC, tied for first with Stan
ford, will meet Cal today and Santa
Clara tomorrow. Thus, the Indian:;
have a golden chance to forge ahead
of their hated rivals from Smoglarid.
Decider Next Week
The whole CIBA mess ends next
week when USC and Stanford meet
in two games in Los Angeles. To
the winner goes the spoils.
One of the most encouraging
aspects of Stanford's stretch drive ij
home run hitting of Charlie Esse
gian and the return to form of Jack
Shepard.
According to many old timers,
Shepard and Essegian are the most
lethal one-two punch in Stanford
history. Essegian, who came to Stan
ford via Menlo JC, was just another
outfielder last year.
Home-Run King
Then, this season all that latent
power of his came to the surface and
he began powering home runs out of
the sunken diamond with reckless
abandon. Twenty-three four masters
have been lost out of the Sunken
Diamond. Poker-faced Chuck has
collected eight of them. Twice, he
got two homers in one game. He ha,3
also blasted two home runs in other
parks. His all-over batting average
is .368.
Shepard, who plays right field,
first base, and catcher was the
scorge of the league last year and
the CIBA's leading sticker. He fell
into an early season slump, but
found his batting eye and is making
opposing pitchers sweat just as much
as they used to.
Other factors in Stanford's amaz
ing resurgc is Warren Goodrich's
batting (.327) and the return to form
of Joe Chez. Chez, the goodies man,
is the top hurler in the league with
a three and nothing record.
IJverett Dean's men of
diamond, victorious in their last
six CIBA contests, will tie into
Santa Clara this afternoon in
their last home league game and
then travel to Berkeley for h
double header with Cal tomoi
row.
Today's tiff is slated for 3:15 p.m.;
tomorrow's twin bill gets under way
at 1:30.
Bob Murphy, tlio San Mateo
curve-baller, will toe the slab to
day in opposition to the Broncos'
Dick Camilli. The last time these
two met, Murphy hurled a one-hitter
and Camilli got off a three-hitter.
The Cards won, 3 to 0, on the
strength of Dick Corzine's three-run
homer.
