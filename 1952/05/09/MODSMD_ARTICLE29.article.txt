# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Those Who Live in Glass lit uises ♦ . .
Wednesday was the Chappie's day ;il hat. Today is
mine.
The reason for this expose is twofold: one, pure and
simple revenge; and, two, to inform you of the threat
to sanity that lurlcs in the back closet of the UK
building which is called the Chappie office.
1 probably would never have written this column
if 1 hadn't passed my old pal Joe on Quad last Wed
nesday.

"Hi, Joe," I smiled.
"Hi, Grotesque," he shot hack
cleverly.
"Hi, what?" I inquired. "What
strange name is this?"
"Haven't you read the Chappie
this morning?" Joe asked.
"The Chappie, why, Jinkies,
only Chappie staff members and
Deans read that."
"Well, Grotesque," allowed Joe,
"you had better read it today.
They racked up the Daily and
you today."

Wanting (<> see what manner nl people it was that
chopped the Daily, I asked Joe hi take nie to the
< happie shark. Joe had heen on the gag niag last
year, lint was dropped because he told a clean joke
once.
Within the Cliaparral edifice are the oddest col
lection of characters to be found on this or any other
campus. At first I thought that they were tlie elves
for Ham's Head's "Finian's Rainbow," but. Joe iti
formed me that those creatures were the staff mem
bers.
From outside there is hardly a sound to be heard.
No raucous laughter, no clicking of typewriters. Just
the sound of scissors as the Hammer and Collin So
ciety clip a few jokes here, a few cartoons there, and
articles from other college humor magazines.
The reason why there is no laughter is that the

( liappyites (rhymes with Copyrights) HAVE NO
SFNSE OF HUMOR. Joe tells me lliut one of the
fja>i sessions in ihe shack is like a post mortem.
Anyone who even titters at a story is exiled for
heing emotional.
The grand marshall and spiritual leader of the or
ganization is John Motheral. John, the son of poor
but honest immigrant folk from England, reformed the
magazine and brought it up (or down) to its present
level. The Great Man's Lady (and business manager)
is Cornie Little.
Fd Brennan (you've seen his face a hundred times
—he's the one who imitates the Frankenstein mask)
is editor. It's Ed's ioh to subscribe to al! the humor
mags from other campuses and get kicked out of
school if one of the minor editors thinks some
thing "is so funny that no one possibly could take
any offense."
Speaking of minor editors, there are quite a few
of them around the Chappie shack. When they aren't
bowing to Motheral and Brennan, they sit around
and practice making pained faces. Like their econ
professor just fold litem they got the highest C plus
in the class.
When they aren't making faces, they create weird
noises that would scare the most calloused Boris
Karloff fan. When they aren't d°' n g any of the above
things, they just sit around and cut out paper dolls
and froth at the mouth.
This is the atmosphere in which the Chappie is put
out.
One of these minor editors is Dunlap Clark, fie
aft'eclionatley tikes to call himself Cnkie Diiimy. His
potions of death are so skillful that most people get
a lethal load ami don't even know it. (But Unkie
Ounny does, and hoy does he chuckle).
Barney Gugel, another minor functionary, is the
walking inspiration for the sad-faced one who wears
the jester's cap.
So if you see some poor looking creep witli his
scissors and paste pot, scrounging through old joke
books in the library, don't cut him. He has enough
cutting to do anyway ...
