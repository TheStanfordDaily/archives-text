### 
DENVER, May 8-The first hint
that the crippling oil strike might
spread to previously exempt Cali
fornia came tonight as the ninth
day of the walkout saw the govern
ment crack down further on avia
tion gasoline users.
California has not been involved
in the strike of some 90,000 oil
workers in order that the flow of
vital fuel to the Korean battlefront
might not be interrupted.
