## A 						Basic Issue—The Defense of Minority Viewpoints 
### 
To the Editor:
The recent controversy about Robeson, the Loyally
Oath at Cal, the intermittent investigations of com
munism in the film industry and numerous other
similar events call for a discussion of the basic issues
involved. These matters concern every one who does
not want to see our democracy become corrupted to
either communism or fascism.
Ilave some of the members of a democracy the
light to deny freedom of investigation and of ex
pression to other members of that nation.' None of
us, I believe, would tolerate actual treason or vio
lence against our government. But many of us would
defend most strongly the right of any minority view,
for, to us, this is the most basic premise of American
democracy.
A democracy can prosper only when it consists of
an intelligent, mature, socially responsible citizenry.
People do not acquire these virtues by being "shelt
ered" from all controversy or by being plied with the
propaganda of a single group. Such traits can only
be developed through education, discussion of all

issues, anil encouragement to think.
Membership in a democracy entails both privileges
and responsibilities. One must think intelligently and
honestly, and then take whatever legal action he
deems necessary. The people who would take this
right and duty out of the hands of the citizens are
the worst foes democracy has.
Democracy's values must be made clear to all, for
wo do not cherish that which we, in ignorance, take
for granted. It offers more freedom and more par
ticipation in government than any other form of gov
ernment.. Its basic values are human dignity and
human rights. It is, I am positive, able to meet
communism, fascism, or any other —ism on the field
of fair and open debate and come away the victor.
Any one attempting to prevent free discussion of
democracy and communism implies a belief that (I)
our I Mow citizens are fools, or (2) that communism,
given a fair chance, would replace democracy and
that he wants to prevent this out of purely selfish
interests. I don't think any of us mean to do this.
