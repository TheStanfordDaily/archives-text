### 
Petitions demanding an end to
University of California executive
committee control over campus
publications are being circulated
on the Berkeley campus.
If five per cent of the student
body sign the petitions, the pro
posed constitutional amendment
ending Excom control will be placed
on the ballot Friday, May 1(J.
The present constitution gives the
Cal executive committee power to
control editorial policies of the
Daily Californian. This power was
used recently in the controversy
over the Daily's advisorv board.
The proposed amendment states
that Excom shall retain control over
publication appointments and budg
ets, but "the editorial policies of the
various publications shall be con
trolled solely by the editorial
boards of the various publications."
It also provides that the editor of
the Daily Californian shall be a rep
resentative on Excom.
The amendment i.s sponsored by
the Cal Publications Council. A
favorable vote of two-thirds of the
students balloting is neces.ary for
adoption.
