# Indian Batonmen In Fresno Relays
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
Stanford's baton hopefuls will travel 100-odd miles (by train)
tomorrow to travel several more miles (by foot) as the Indians open
up the 1952 relay eeason at the 25th annual West Coast Relays at
Tresno.
All the major schools and athletic clubs from the West will be

there, including some of the top in
dividual performers in the nation.
Big gun of the meet will be the
terrible Trojans from Southern Cal.
'JYoy is odds on favorites to walk
away with all the marbles, as usual,
but many of the individual races
and the close race for second will
be well worth the 2 V: > hour trip.
Three world records will be on the
line as the meet runs well into the
night. In the pole vault, the Rev.
R'obert Richards, "the flying parson,"
will set his sights on ex-Cal great
Dutch Warmerdam's 15 loot 7% inch
record vault.
The discus record might also fall,
bill who will break it is still in
doubt. Both Fortune Gordien,
holder of the present world's rec
ord of 180 feet II inches, and SC's
junior sensation, Sim Innes, will
battle it out for first place and a
possible record. Not to be dis
counted, Mr. Robert Mathias is
right up there with the nations top
platter tossers, and could conceiv
ably sneak in.
In the running department, the
only .serious threat to a world's rec
ord is the Occidental medley relay
team. The present record stands at
9:56.3.
The big show, as far as Stanford
enthusiasts are concerned, will be
the aforementioned Mr. Mathias's
private track meet. The versatile
fciant will the high hurdles,
.shot put, discus, and will probably
anchor the 440 yard and 880 yard
relay teams. Rumors tiiat he would
run both the first and last laps of
the above relays are definitely false.
One of the best individual races

of the day will probably be (he 120
yard high hurdles, which pits Bob
with SC's national champ, Jack
Davis, for the first time this year.
Other possible entrants in the
event may be Olympic hopefuls
Craig Dixon and Dick Attlesey, ex
of UCLA and USC respectively.
In the 5,000 meter run, a prep for
the Olympics, Stanford's Bub Reed
will once more match .strides with
SC's Art Garcia and Occidental's
Bob MacMillan in what should be
another tough tussle.
For those enthusiasts interested in
taking the three-hour-drive to see

a meeting of many of the nation's
finest athletes in action, the meet will
start at 2:30. The preliminaries will
take up most of the afternoon and
the meet will extend on until about
10:30 p.m.
