## Card Golf Team Cops PCC Title 
### MIKE HUDSON 
Stanford's golfers are PCC
champs. Becords fell as four Card
golfers shot 3G holes each in 587
strokes. This mark erased the pre
vious low of 590 strokes set by
Stanford in 1947. They defeated
second-place USC by 12 strokes.
Fred Brown, the Cards' number
one man, shot spectacular golf over
the G,l(>J - yard Mira Vista Club
course as he shared tourney medal
honors with National Public Links
champion Dave Stanley with 142.
Stanley and Brown tied the all-time
record for low qualifying medal
score.
Other Card come-throughs were
recorded by fifth and sixth men
Grant Spaeth and Dick Taylor.
Botli men are long hitters and they
tore the short course apart to the
tune of 140 for Spaeth and 147 for
Taylor. Dick McElyea and Warren
Dailey shot good 152's and Art
Schroeder fired a 157.
The 1G top qualifiers start match

Brown and Dailey, meeting. McEl
