# Swimmers Face Trojans & UCLA
## 
### JIM MADISON 
Fourteen confident Card .swim
mers and Coach Tom Haynie left
last night on the Lark for the
Southland where they will tangle
with USC this afternoon and UCLA
tomorrow.
It's getting monotonous, but once
again it's very safe to say that Stan
ford is heavily favored to win both
meets.
El Troje boasts only three swim
mers of any note and the Bruins
one.
The SC men are led by Alan Gil
christ in the 220 and 440, who is
good enough to give Pete Cole quite
a struggle in Loth. Since Bob
Thompson is not making tiie trip
because ol Med School entrance
exams, Card soph Jim Lee will be
swimming lor the third spit in both
distance events.
Alex Mazarik in the 50 and 100
or individual medley and Jack Lu
citt defending conference diving
champ, figure to give the Cards any
other trouble they may run into in
the SC meet. This shouldn't be
much, as this year neither of the
latter Trojans has come up to pre
vious performances.
Moving over to the Westwood
plunge on Saturday, the Indians
will find Jack Spargo the sole Bruin
threat to take anything but an au
tomatic third place.
Spargo swims at various times
the backstroke, 100, 220, and 440
Ireestyle, but liis times this season
don't make him a serious threat in
any of these events.
