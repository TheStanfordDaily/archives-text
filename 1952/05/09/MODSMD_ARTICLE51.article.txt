# Board of Trustees Delermines Financial Policy for University
## 
### HARRY GLAZE 
Taking care of the Stanford
heritage is a big job; and though
the Board of Trustees receives
little recognition, as legal owner
of the endowment and property
it has complete control of the
University and all its policies.
These 15 men, 11 of whom are
Stanford graduates, devote one full
day each month and some extra
time to managing the University's
affairs. Unlike board members of
large corporations, they receive no
pay for giving their valuable time.
When Gov. Leland Stanford
founded (lie University, he called
together 24 distinguished men to
serve iis trustees. Through the
first years, when the Stanfords
decided most of the policy, the
hoard did not have a great deal
of power.
After Gov. Stanford died, Mrs.
Stanford took the he.m in running
(lie University. When she was 75,
(hough, she wanted to turn all the
responsibility over to the board.
According to the Founding Grant
this would have been illegal while
she was alive; and a special law
was passed in the State Legislature
to permit the transfer of authority.
Since Mrs. Stanford's death the
hoard h;ts had complete control
ol University affairs. She used to
make appointments to the hoard
herself, but now the group clecls
its own members to serve terms
of l(> years.
Paul C. Edwards, associate editor
of the San Francisco News, has
served four years of his five-year
term as board president. He suc
ceeded W. P. Fuller Jr., chairman
of the board of W. P. Fuller & Co.
Of the remaining 14 members of
the board, five arc lawyers. Her
man Phleger, of San Francisco, was
deputy chief of the State Depart
ment's legal division in Germany in
1D45 and J94(1. George Morcll is
pre ident. of Peninsula Newspapers,
Inc., which publishes the Palo Alto
limes. Ira S. Lillick and Lloyd W.
Dinkelspiel practice law in San
Francisco, while George A. Ditz
practices in Stockton.
Homer Roberts Spence is Asso
ciate Justice of the California Su
preme Court. Other hoard mem
bers include James Byers Black,
president of Pacific Gas and Elec
tric; John E. Cushing, president
of the American - Hawaiian
Steamship Co.; Leland W. Cutler,
chairman r 112 the San Francisco
World Trade Center Agencv; and
Charles IJ. Blyth, president of
B'yth & Co.. nationwide invest
ment hanking firm.
Both Mrs. Roger Goodan and Dr.
Seeley G. Mudd come from Los An

geles to attend board meetings. Dr.
Mudd was dean of the USC medical
school from 1941 to 1943.
Herbert Hoover has served on the
board since 1912—longer than any
other member. He attends only the
July meetings but keeps in touch
with Stanford through correspond
ence with President Sterling.
The greatest responsibility of
the Board of Trustees, according
to Edwards, is the selection of
University presidents. In such de
cisions a unanimous approval is
required. Most of the hoard's
other decisions arc made on rec
ommendation of the president of
the University.
Stanford traditions at times cause
problems which the board must
solve. When Stern Hall was built in
1949, many people thought that it
should have a red tile roof to pre
serve the architectural style of the
University. The board decided,
however, that it would not be worth
the extra money.
The Board of Trustees is divided
into five committees, most of which
meet separately before each regular
board meeting at their offices in the
Balfour Building in San Francisco
The Investment Committee has
charge of the endowment of (he
University. Originally $20 million,
the endowment has grown to ap

| proximately $!17 million, averag
i ing four per cent earnings. The
j Finance Committee handles the
budget and must approve all
spending.
Matters concerning faculty, stu
dents, and educational policy are
under the jurisdiction of the Aca
demic Affairs Committee. The
Euildings and Grounds Committee
takes care of all the land in the aca
demic area. Stanford has greater
problems than most universities,
according to Edwards, because it is
a municipality in itself. It must
have its own utilities and roads.
No private university can get
along without raising money. For
this purpose the Planning ;.nd De
velopment Committee completes the
list of board
