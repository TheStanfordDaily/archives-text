# Northern California Greyhound Bus Strike Ends
## Runs Will Resume by May 19 On Vote of 3.500 Strikers 
### 
SAN FPANCISCO, May 11 (UP)—A 67-day strike of Pacific
Greyhound bus drivers in seven western states ended today with
an aqreement giving the drivers their chief demand, a five-doy
work week.
Greyhound said bus service will bo restored on all routes by

May 1!) at the latest if the 3,500 mem
bers of the AFL Amalgamated As
sociation of Motor Coach Employes
approve the agreement by vote.
M. C. Frailey, company operating
manager, announced "the buses will
roll as soon as 51 per cent of the men
ratify the agreement—commute bus
es first, then the inter-city buses."
The employees will receive a 1.6-
per cent wage increase immediately,
but Pacific Greyhound has until
Oct. I. 1953, to put the five-day week
into effect. Wages henceforth will
be tied to the cost-of-living index.
Union officers and company repre
sentatives announced they were in
agreement on the new contract early
today after a 12-hour bargaining ses
sion.
Pacific Greyhound operates in
California, Oregon, Arizona, Utah,
Nevada, New Mexico, and parts of
Texas.
The settlement is expected to set
the pattern for agreements between
the drivers and the Northwest Grey
hound Co. and the Overland Grey
hound lines in Washington and Utah.
Some HOO drivers and station em
ployees went out on strike there last
week.
The new reduced working sched
ules will be introduced gradually
under the settlement, being com
pleted by Oct. 1, 1953.
