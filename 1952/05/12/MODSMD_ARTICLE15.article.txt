# Indian Nine Still Tied For First Place in CIBA
## Bow to Santa Clara on Friday 7 to 3; Sweep Twin Bill With Cal Saturday 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford's baseballers played footsie with first place this week
end. Santa Clara dropped them, 7 to 3, to put them one game off
USC's pace on Friday, and then the Cards blasted Cal twice on
Saturday, 18 to 7 and 4 to 2, to regain their first place tie.
The Friday tiff was Santa Clara's game from wire to wire. Bob

Murphy, who hurled one-hit balM
against the Drones last time, was
cuffed for two runs in the first in

Don Seybold, who only gave the |
kids from the Farm two hits, broke I
Stanford's six game CIBA win
streak. However, Seybold was loose
with his control in the ninth, and j
the Indians pushed across three runs j
on three walks and an error.
Indians Fail in Clutch

in the clutch, as Stanford batsman I
failed to produce with men on the
bases. Gus Suhr, John McClellan, |
and Ken Nardinelli were the hitting |
stars for the Broncos.
Saturday, the Indians took advan- j
tage of Southern Cal's split with i
Santa Clara to move into co-occu- |
pancy of the penthouse again.
Everything comes to a dramatic cli
max next weekend when USC hosts
Stanford in a pair of games. If each
wins a game, a sudden death play
off decides the whole mess.
The first name against Cal must
mark some kind of a record of sheer
brutality to a pitcher. The Cards
blasted starter A1 Mathews for 11
runs before Clint Evans decided to
remove him. In all, Everett Dean's
squad collected JH of the goodies on
15 hits ami six Cal miscucs. It was
the biggest score ever recorded in an
Indian-Bear tilt.
Rout in 7th
What was a close game turned out
to be a rout in the seventh. With the
