# Indian Nine Still Tied For First Place in CIBA
## Bow to Santa Clara on Friday 7 to 3; Sweep Twin Bill With Cal Saturday 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford's baseballers played footsie with first place this week
end. Santa Clara dropped them, 7 to 3, to put them one game off
USC's pace on Friday, and then the Cards blasted Cal twice on
Saturday, 18 to 7 and 4 to 2, to regain their first place tie.
The Friday tiff was Santa Clara's game from wire to wire. Bob

Murphy, who hurled one-hit balM
against the Drones last time, was
cuffed for two runs in the first in
ning and three in the second. Fresh- I
man Ken Brown came in and pitched
excellent ball, but the damage had
already been done.
Don Seybold, who only gave the |
kids from the Farm two hits, broke I
Stanford's six game CIBA win
streak. However, Seybold was loose
with his control in the ninth, and j
the Indians pushed across three runs j
on three walks and an error.
Indians Fail in Clutch
Otherwise, it was a story of futility
in the clutch, as Stanford batsman I
failed to produce with men on the
bases. Gus Suhr, John McClellan, |
and Ken Nardinelli were the hitting |
stars for the Broncos.
Saturday, the Indians took advan- j
tage of Southern Cal's split with i
Santa Clara to move into co-occu- |
pancy of the penthouse again.
Everything comes to a dramatic cli
max next weekend when USC hosts
Stanford in a pair of games. If each
wins a game, a sudden death play
off decides the whole mess.
The first name against Cal must
mark some kind of a record of sheer
brutality to a pitcher. The Cards
blasted starter A1 Mathews for 11
runs before Clint Evans decided to
remove him. In all, Everett Dean's
squad collected JH of the goodies on
15 hits ami six Cal miscucs. It was
the biggest score ever recorded in an
Indian-Bear tilt.
Rout in 7th
What was a close game turned out
to be a rout in the seventh. With the
score knotted at six-all, Jack Shep- |
aid beat out an infield single and
then Chuck Essegian slashed a hit ;
down the left field line. Bruno j
Powell doubled 322 feet into right 1
to chase in Essegian and Shepard.
Next, it was a Ray Swarts single, I
a Dick Corzine rainbow hit lo center, I
and an Art Abrahamson blooper to I
center. When the dust had lifted,
the Indians were in command, 11 «to
G. Stanford piled on seven more in
the ninth.
Close Nightcap
The second game was just as close
as the first one was lopsided. The
Cards, with Joe Chez on the mound,
were leading 2 to 1, going into the
.seventh and final inning. Cal tied
up the affair as Jerry Hinton raced
home on Tom Keough's single to
center.
The Bears threatened every inning
thereafter, but Chez always bore
down superbly in the clutch.
Finally, in the tenth, Co-capfain
Art Abrahamson, who banged out
four for five, led oft' with a grass
cutter past short. Then Warren
Goodrich lay down a perfect bunt
that Cal pitcher Doug Weeks mis
fired over the first baseman's head.
Right fielder Tom Pollack picked up
Week's errant throw and heaved
wildly at the plate, allowing Abra
hamson to scoot across. Goodrich
tallied a moment later on Dick Cole's
outfield fly.
Cal Rallies in 10th
But Cal wasn't finished. In the
bottom of the tenth, Cal put two men
on bases. With two down, Keough,
Berkeley's best stiekman, came to
the plate. He greeted a Chez offering
and smacked it deep into right
center.
It was too far for Cole to reach,
but Powell, who is far more noted
for his hitting than for his fielding,
got on his seventeen horses and
made a spectacular catch to give the
game to the Cards.
Rog Osenbaugh got credit for the
win in the first contest while league
leading Joe Chez chalked up his
fourth win aaginst no losses in the
nightcap.

Close Nightcap
The second game was just as close

.seventh and final inning. Cal tied
up the affair as Jerry Hinton raced
home on Tom Keough's single to

thereafter, but Chez always bore
down superbly in the clutch.
Finally, in the tenth, Co-capfain
Art Abrahamson, who banged out
four for five, led oft' with a grass
cutter past short. Then Warren
Goodrich lay down a perfect bunt
that Cal pitcher Doug Weeks mis
fired over the first baseman's head.
Right fielder Tom Pollack picked up
Week's errant throw and heaved
wildly at the plate, allowing Abra
hamson to scoot across. Goodrich
tallied a moment later on Dick Cole's
outfield fly.
Cal Rallies in 10th
But Cal wasn't finished. In the
bottom of the tenth, Cal put two men
on bases. With two down, Keough,
Berkeley's best stiekman, came to
the plate. He greeted a Chez offering
and smacked it deep into right
center.
It was too far for Cole to reach,
but Powell, who is far more noted
for his hitting than for his fielding,
got on his seventeen horses and
made a spectacular catch to give the
game to the Cards.
Rog Osenbaugh got credit for the

Stanford's baseballers played footsie with first place this week
end. Santa Clara dropped them, 7 to 3, to put them one game off
USC's pace on Friday, and then the Cards blasted Cal twice on
Saturday, 18 to 7 and 4 to 2, to regain their first place tie.
The Friday tiff was Santa Clara's game from wire to wire. Bob

Murphy, who hurled one-hit balM
against the Drones last time, was
cuffed for two runs in the first in
ning and three in the second. Fresh- I
man Ken Brown came in and pitched
excellent ball, but the damage had
already been done.
Don Seybold, who only gave the |
kids from the Farm two hits, broke I
Stanford's six game CIBA win
streak. However, Seybold was loose
with his control in the ninth, and j
the Indians pushed across three runs j
on three walks and an error.
Indians Fail in Clutch
Otherwise, it was a story of futility
in the clutch, as Stanford batsman I
failed to produce with men on the
bases. Gus Suhr, John McClellan, |
and Ken Nardinelli were the hitting |
stars for the Broncos.
Saturday, the Indians took advan- j
tage of Southern Cal's split with i
Santa Clara to move into co-occu- |
pancy of the penthouse again.
Everything comes to a dramatic cli
max next weekend when USC hosts
Stanford in a pair of games. If each
wins a game, a sudden death play
off decides the whole mess.
The first name against Cal must
mark some kind of a record of sheer
brutality to a pitcher. The Cards
blasted starter A1 Mathews for 11

USC's pace on Friday, and then the Cards blasted Cal twice on
Saturday, 18 to 7 and 4 to 2, to regain their first place tie.
The Friday tiff was Santa Clara's game from wire to wire. Bob

Murphy, who hurled one-hit balM
against the Drones last time, was
cuffed for two runs in the first in
ning and three in the second. Fresh- I
man Ken Brown came in and pitched
excellent ball, but the damage had
already been done.
Don Seybold, who only gave the |
kids from the Farm two hits, broke I
Stanford's six game CIBA win
streak. However, Seybold was loose
with his control in the ninth, and j
the Indians pushed across three runs j
on three walks and an error.
Indians Fail in Clutch
Otherwise, it was a story of futility
in the clutch, as Stanford batsman I
failed to produce with men on the
bases. Gus Suhr, John McClellan, |
and Ken Nardinelli were the hitting |
stars for the Broncos.
Saturday, the Indians took advan- j
tage of Southern Cal's split with i
Santa Clara to move into co-occu- |
pancy of the penthouse again.
Everything comes to a dramatic cli
max next weekend when USC hosts
Stanford in a pair of games. If each
wins a game, a sudden death play
off decides the whole mess.
The first name against Cal must
mark some kind of a record of sheer
brutality to a pitcher. The Cards
blasted starter A1 Mathews for 11
runs before Clint Evans decided to
remove him. In all, Everett Dean's
squad collected JH of the goodies on
15 hits ami six Cal miscucs. It was
the biggest score ever recorded in an
Indian-Bear tilt.
Rout in 7th
What was a close game turned out
to be a rout in the seventh. With the
score knotted at six-all, Jack Shep- |
aid beat out an infield single and
then Chuck Essegian slashed a hit ;
down the left field line. Bruno j
Powell doubled 322 feet into right 1
to chase in Essegian and Shepard.
Next, it was a Ray Swarts single, I
a Dick Corzine rainbow hit lo center, I
and an Art Abrahamson blooper to I
center. When the dust had lifted,
the Indians were in command, 11 «to
G. Stanford piled on seven more in
the ninth.
Close Nightcap
The second game was just as close
as the first one was lopsided. The
Cards, with Joe Chez on the mound,
were leading 2 to 1, going into the
.seventh and final inning. Cal tied
up the affair as Jerry Hinton raced
home on Tom Keough's single to
center.
The Bears threatened every inning
thereafter, but Chez always bore
down superbly in the clutch.
Finally, in the tenth, Co-capfain
Art Abrahamson, who banged out
four for five, led oft' with a grass
cutter past short. Then Warren
Goodrich lay down a perfect bunt
that Cal pitcher Doug Weeks mis
fired over the first baseman's head.
Right fielder Tom Pollack picked up
Week's errant throw and heaved
wildly at the plate, allowing Abra
hamson to scoot across. Goodrich
tallied a moment later on Dick Cole's
outfield fly.
Cal Rallies in 10th
But Cal wasn't finished. In the
bottom of the tenth, Cal put two men
on bases. With two down, Keough,
Berkeley's best stiekman, came to
the plate. He greeted a Chez offering
and smacked it deep into right
center.
It was too far for Cole to reach,
but Powell, who is far more noted
for his hitting than for his fielding,
got on his seventeen horses and
made a spectacular catch to give the
game to the Cards.
Rog Osenbaugh got credit for the
win in the first contest while league
leading Joe Chez chalked up his
fourth win aaginst no losses in the
nightcap.
