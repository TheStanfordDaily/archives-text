# Talk on Radio Astronomy Set for Series
## 
### 
How the new science of radio
astronomy is increasing our knowl
edge of the universe will be dis
cussed at tomorrow's Tuesday Eve
ning Series lecture at 7:30 in Me
morial Auditorium by Dr. Oswald
Garrison Villard Jr., young Stanford
radio research engineer.
Dr. Villard's subject is "Radio
'Eyes' for the Astronomer and
Weatherman." He will be introduced

by Dr. Leland Hermon Brown, pro
fessor of electrical engineering.
Using slides, motion pictures, and
tape recordings, Dr. Villard will tell
what radio astronomy has revealed
about the earth's atmosphere and its
circulation at heights of 40 miles and
more above the surface.
This knowledge is of particular
benefit in weather forecasting and
designing guided missiles. It has
opened up new possibilities in radio
communications, as well.
Since 1942 Dr. Villard has been co
director, with Stanford's Professor
Laurence A. Manning, of a project
to study meteoric ionization of the
upper atmosphere for the Office of
Naval Research. They have success
fully measured the speed and height
of meteors by the use of a continu
ous high-frequency radio wave di
rected at the sky.
He is the son of the famous liberal
editor and author, Oswald Garrison
Villard. His father was publisher
and chief editorial writer of the New
York Evening Post from 1KD7 to 1918.
