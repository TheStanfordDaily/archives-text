# Now That 'Humor' Mag

### 
NOW THAT the Chappie has successfully
rounded the cycle that began a year ago with
publication of the ill-fated Crash Comics, and
ended with a better received (but lower selling)
Faultless Funnies, we can make a critical ap
praisal of the magazine this year.
Faultless Funnies, we think, has some of the
early post-suspension binds out of the system.
Trite, but true, it is funny without being dirty.
The Chappie staff last fall, laboring with the
taste of last spring's suspension still in its
mouth reflected an uncertainty that was re
vealed in the early issues. The staff was cau
tious, stung by the suspension, guestioning its
own standards, fearful of misinterpretation,
wary of double meanings; and efficiency and
healthy expression of humor were impaired.
Gradually it has come out of its uncertainty.
The suspension put the magazine in a diffi
cult spot. The staff was caught in a squeeze
between one segment of the student body on
the one hand and the administration on the
other. There has been some criticism that
the magazine this year has been "too tame."
Many of the same students v/ho were offend
ed by last year's fiasco have clamored for
less restraint this year. And the Chappie was
faced with the problem of reflecting campus

humor, and on the more practical side staying
in business.
The "too tame" school is in a beautiful spot.
It can demand a "loose" magazine while never
having to bear the responsibility for "exceed
ing the bounds of good taste," and being able
to summon up righteous regret and a feeling of
being offended if the staff yields to its tastes.
Fortunately, the "too tame" school didn't pre
vail. The staff reflected the humor of another
segment .of the campus. It developed a con
science that grew stronger and stabler as the
year progressed. It refused to try to go just as
far as it thought it safely could, which had been
the practice for some issues preceding the
suspension.
The magazine's new editorial setup, provid
ing for "self-censoring" is a solution to the taste
problem that was long needed. Prior adminis
tration censorship is something no one wants.
There is no reason why students can't handle
their own problems in this sphere. The self
censoring mechanism is a way of defining hu
mor standards and this year's Chappie, emerg
ing out of its uncertainty, has laid a good foun
dation.
We hope we can continue to laugh with the
Old Boy, not at him.

censoring mechanism is a way of defining hu
mor standards and this year's Chappie, emerg
ing out of its uncertainty, has laid a good foun
dation.
We hope we can continue to laugh with the
Old Boy, not at him.
NOW THAT the Chappie has successfully
rounded the cycle that began a year ago with
publication of the ill-fated Crash Comics, and
ended with a better received (but lower selling)
Faultless Funnies, we can make a critical ap
praisal of the magazine this year.
Faultless Funnies, we think, has some of the
early post-suspension binds out of the system.
Trite, but true, it is funny without being dirty.
The Chappie staff last fall, laboring with the
taste of last spring's suspension still in its
mouth reflected an uncertainty that was re
vealed in the early issues. The staff was cau
tious, stung by the suspension, guestioning its
own standards, fearful of misinterpretation,
wary of double meanings; and efficiency and
healthy expression of humor were impaired.
Gradually it has come out of its uncertainty.
The suspension put the magazine in a diffi
cult spot. The staff was caught in a squeeze
between one segment of the student body on
the one hand and the administration on the
other. There has been some criticism that
the magazine this year has been "too tame."
Many of the same students v/ho were offend
ed by last year's fiasco have clamored for
less restraint this year. And the Chappie was
faced with the problem of reflecting campus

humor, and on the more practical side staying
in business.
The "too tame" school is in a beautiful spot.
It can demand a "loose" magazine while never
having to bear the responsibility for "exceed
ing the bounds of good taste," and being able
to summon up righteous regret and a feeling of
being offended if the staff yields to its tastes.
Fortunately, the "too tame" school didn't pre
vail. The staff reflected the humor of another
segment .of the campus. It developed a con
science that grew stronger and stabler as the
year progressed. It refused to try to go just as
far as it thought it safely could, which had been
the practice for some issues preceding the
suspension.
The magazine's new editorial setup, provid
ing for "self-censoring" is a solution to the taste
problem that was long needed. Prior adminis
tration censorship is something no one wants.
There is no reason why students can't handle
their own problems in this sphere. The self
censoring mechanism is a way of defining hu
mor standards and this year's Chappie, emerg
ing out of its uncertainty, has laid a good foun
dation.
