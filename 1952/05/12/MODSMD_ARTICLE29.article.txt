### DICK McLEAN 
IF. . . (FOR MFN)
IF you were president of your high school,
Or holder of another hot dog office,
And didn't study but still got grades.
And when the time came for college,
You decided that you'd like the Best,
Sent in your application to "Join the Band."
And sweated until ihe letter came,
The one from Doc Snyder that said, "Yes" . . .
IF you said "so long" to a lot of friend.",
The fellows, the girls—especially one,
And promised to write a letter a day.
Had a long talk with your flustered Dad,
Who stuttered about "stuff and things."
Tossed away the high school sweater,
Pull up the underslung Levis,
Kissed the tearful ones with much bravado,
And—a little scared—left for college . . .
IF you moved into beat-up Encina Hall,
Called the sponsor "Sir" for a week,
Then got cockey and waterbatiged him,
And got in return Con Home hours.
And longed for the girl back homo,
Sneered at the "Stanford Beauties,"
Then got used to calling them up,
A week or ten days in advance.
And, once getting a date, liked it,
But never admitting it, by God . . .

IF you had to study like hell to pass,
Crammed for Civ and a foreign language,
Liked the former and hated the latter,
Thought you'd never leave lower division.
Learned from chemistry one and two,
That a doctor's life was not for you.
And searched around for another major,
Something reasonable like Hygiene ...
IF you like girls, long-stemmed with gray eyes,
To take out, to impress the drooling guys,
But when the time comes for losing the pin,
You'll discount for a face or even a limb,
Arid not mind her not having a slinky walk.
In lieu of a girl with whom you can talk.
(Most of the time, talking is fine,
But the smokey-eyed kind are fun too ...)
IF you have learned in the time of college,
A lot about people, a bit of knowledge,
At least one verse of the Hymn,
To hate Cal, the Board of Equalization.
To worry about the national debt,
The challenge of democracy,
And the farm subsidy program,
To like beer and Friday afternoons,
Big Game parties and moral victories ...
IF you'll admit that it's all been good,
All of it—the work, worry, the fun . . .
THEN you're a STANFORD MAN, my son ...
