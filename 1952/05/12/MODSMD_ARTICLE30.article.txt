## 'Cut Expenses, Increase Revenue' 
### 
To the Editor:
Suggestion—Mr. AI Masters.
You state that "for the next five years it will prob
alby be necessary to work out cuts in the overall
athletic program," would it not be possible to increase
the price of football tickets by a half a dollar or more
to offset this anticipated deficit? If a price rise in all
tickets is not feasible, would it not be possible to
charge more for the seats between the twenty yard
lines?

I believe the demand for Big Game tickets is in
elastic enough that, at least, a progressive pricing
policy could be established on them. I am not one for
deficit spending, but it can be eliminated two ways.
First, cut expenses which may be detrimental to the
whole athletic program or secondly, increase total
revenue. The latter seems to be the most logical
solution.
