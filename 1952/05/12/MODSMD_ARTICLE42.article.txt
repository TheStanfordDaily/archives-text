# Thinclads Are 2nd and 7th At the West Coast Relays
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
Confusion was the rule as the 26th Annual West Coast "Rat Race," occasionally known as the
Fresno Relays, roared on into the night last Saturday.
Stanford did well as a team, taking second in the college class behind SC and a tie for seventh
with Oklahoma in the open class.
Los Angeles Athletic Club ruled the roost in the class, taking four firsts or ties for firsts while

collecting (55V 2 points. The Trojans
were second with 45% points. SC
collected 8.'} 4/5 points to Stanford's
4M in the college class.
Confusion Prevailed
The big gripe made by all was
the confusion. Fourteen hundred
athletes paraded around the field,
events were packed with partici
pants practically to the grass, the
loudspeaker system was going con
stantly, but never giving results,
and no one knew what was coming
off, especially the runners.
The times were quick, but so was
the gun. The starter was firing
while many of the participants were
.still in ther blocks. The only way
to catch the gun was to jump the
gun, which makes for fast times.
As far as individual events go, the
Indians and ex-Indians didn't do
too well. Otis Chandler and Gay
Bryan, scheduled to go for the
Olympic Club of San Francisco in
the shot put and broad jump re
spectively, were both sidelined
with injuries.
Mahtias liliiuL'il
In the high hurdles, which was
supposed to be a duel between Jack
Davis of SC and Bob Mathias for
collegiate honors, Davis came in
ahead by over two yards.
Big Bob was traveling fast on
the outside lane, next to the grand
stand, when one overly admiring
female fan leaned over and flashed
her camera in his face. The effect
was blinding to say the least, anil
Bob crashed into the next hurdle.
He crossed the finish line third
in the college class and seventh in
the open class. Davis and Willard
Wright, both of SC, finished ahead i

of him. Craig Dixon, ex of UCLA,
kept up his Olympic pace with a
:13.9 triumph.
Mathias* toss of 1(50 ft. 1% in.,
some 11 feet off his best, netted him
a fifth in the open class and a third
in the college class.
The expected duel for the record
between LAAC's Fortune Gordien
and SC's Sim Iness flopped as Mon
tana AC's Dick Doyle flipped the
winning platter out 171 ft. 3Va in.
Both Iness and Gordien were ofl
their 180-feet-plus potential.
Bob Stars in Relays
Where "Rapid Robert" showed his
form was in both the 440-yard and
880 - yard relays. Anchoring the
team, he came up against Cal's John
George both times. In the 440, he
took the baton two yards back and
finished two yards back.
The 880-yard relay found Mathias
and George taking the batons in a
dead heat, with Mathias on the out
side. At the finish line, it was
George by two inches in one of the
closest decisions of the day.
In the 5,000-meter run, Bob Reed
took a little pushing around from
Gene Haines of the Navy Olympics
team, but took a third behind SC's
Art Garcia and Bob Stout of the
Olympic Club. Haines actually came
in third, but was disqualified.
Brilliant Broad Jump
Probably the most outstanding in
dividual performance of the day
was flying George Brown's 2(5—ft.
3>/i-in. broad jump. This is the
third longest jump on record, be
ing topped only by Jesse Owens'
world mark of 2(5 ft. 8% in. and San
Diego State's Willie Steele's best of
26 ft. G in.
The outstanding relay perform
ance of the day was the medley re
lay. Occidental's Sherman Miller
(440), Hal Butler (880), John Barnes
(1,320), and Bob McMillen (mile)
teamed up to overcome the Lock
bourne Air Base team in 9:57.7—
1.7 seconds faster than the old
world mark of 9:59.4.
San Francisco's Ollie Matson, of
football fame, showed his worth on
the track as he clocked off a pair of
:9.G hundreds.
