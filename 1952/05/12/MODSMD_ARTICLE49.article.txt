GOOD CUT—Joe Chez, Stanford's mound ace is shown taking
a hefty swing at one of Ed Mayer's tosses in the nightcap of
Saturday's tv/in-bill with Cal at Edward's Field in Berkeley.
Joe had to go into ten innings before he could win his fourth
straight CIBA tilt 4 to 2. The Indians remained in the first place
tie with USC as they took two out of their three weekend games.
