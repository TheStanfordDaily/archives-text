Putnam, I'liil Cbapiuan). 3:37.0.
Stanford's .swimmer.; almost lived
up to their advance notices as they
swamped USC and UCLA, (31 to 23
pnd GtJ to 18, respectively, on their
weekend invasion of the Southland.
Highlight of the weekend was
l'rosh Larry Heim's backstroke win
at SC on Friday afternoon. Heim's
time of 2:12.8 approached his sea
son's best and bettered the existing
PCC mark by almost two full sec
onds.
Pete Cole was a double winner,
taking the 220 and 440 both days.
Only disappointing feature of the
trip was the fact that SC and UCLA
were able to garner a first place
each in the dual meets.
UCLA's blue ribbon' was a stun
ning upset of Bill Glathe by Jack
Brodowy in the diving.
