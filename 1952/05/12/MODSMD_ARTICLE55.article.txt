### 
Training in many different engineering branches
opens the door to opportunity at Du Pont

In recent issues of the Digest, we
have discussed opportunities for me
chanical and chemical engineers at
Du Pont. However, this is only part
of the picture. The special skills of
more than a dozen different branches
of engineering are needed on our
scientific teams. For example:
Architectural, civil and structural en
gineers are attached to the central
Engineering Department which han
dles most of the Company's construc
tion projects. In this work they make
site investigations, lay out new
plants, design buildings, determine
construction methods and specify
materials and equipment. They also
assemble necessary labor forces at
field locations and supervise the
building and assembly of complex
manufacturing facilities.
Electrical engineers aid in designing
process equipment and facilities for
power generation and distribution,
air conditioning and refrigeration.
Instrumentation Ls another impor
tant phase of their work. Continuous

automatic analyzers for cyanides,
ultra-violet gas analyzers, multivari
ate recorders, and new photo-multi
plier circuits are just a few of their
developments.
Industrial engineers help develop
methods and standards for new or
improved manufacturing processes.
This work often serves as training
for production supervisors.
Metallurgical engineers play an es
sential part in the central Engineering
Department's program of research.
Their studies are aimed at improving
equipment and construction materi
als, as well as methods of measure
ment and control.
Safety engineers strive constantly to
improve the broad safety program
initiated by the Company's founder
150 years ago. Du Pont is under
standably proud of its safety record,
which in 1950 was eight times better
than the chemical industry's as a
whole, and fourteen times better
than the average for all industry.

This by no means completes (lie
list. Every U. S. industry utilizes
Du Pont products. Hence there is
also a need for specialists in mining,
petroleum, textiles and many other
branches of engineering.
Along with chemists, physicists
and other technical personnel, al
most every kind of engineer finds
opportunity at Du Pont. Your engi
neering degree is only a door opener.
Any man with ideas, imagination
and the ability to handle people will
find plenty of room for advancement
in this company that has never
stopped growing.

and the College Graduate." Describes
futures for men and women with many
types of training. Address: 2521 Nemours

Training in many different engineering branches
opens the door to opportunity at Du Pont

In recent issues of the Digest, we
have discussed opportunities for me
chanical and chemical engineers at
Du Pont. However, this is only part
of the picture. The special skills of
more than a dozen different branches
of engineering are needed on our
scientific teams. For example:
Architectural, civil and structural en
gineers are attached to the central
Engineering Department which han
dles most of the Company's construc
tion projects. In this work they make
site investigations, lay out new
plants, design buildings, determine
construction methods and specify
materials and equipment. They also
assemble necessary labor forces at
field locations and supervise the
building and assembly of complex
manufacturing facilities.
Electrical engineers aid in designing
process equipment and facilities for
power generation and distribution,
air conditioning and refrigeration.
Instrumentation Ls another impor
tant phase of their work. Continuous

automatic analyzers for cyanides,
ultra-violet gas analyzers, multivari
ate recorders, and new photo-multi
plier circuits are just a few of their
developments.
Industrial engineers help develop
methods and standards for new or
improved manufacturing processes.
This work often serves as training
for production supervisors.
Metallurgical engineers play an es
sential part in the central Engineering
Department's program of research.
Their studies are aimed at improving
equipment and construction materi
als, as well as methods of measure
ment and control.
Safety engineers strive constantly to
improve the broad safety program
initiated by the Company's founder
150 years ago. Du Pont is under
standably proud of its safety record,
which in 1950 was eight times better
than the chemical industry's as a
whole, and fourteen times better
than the average for all industry.

This by no means completes (lie
list. Every U. S. industry utilizes
Du Pont products. Hence there is
also a need for specialists in mining,
petroleum, textiles and many other
branches of engineering.
Along with chemists, physicists
and other technical personnel, al
most every kind of engineer finds
opportunity at Du Pont. Your engi
neering degree is only a door opener.
Any man with ideas, imagination
and the ability to handle people will
find plenty of room for advancement
in this company that has never
stopped growing.
