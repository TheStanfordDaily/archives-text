In America a relative lack of
originality, tradition, and cultu
ral heritage is more than com
pensated for by optimism, infor
mality, and a flexible class struc
lure, generalized Erik van Ga
len, ASSU Foreign Scholar,
prefacing a comparison of Eu
rope and America.
Ilcre in "the most sociable nation
in the world," explained the tall,
husky Dutch student, "social play
follows strictly regulated patterns."
Admitting that he was exaggerating
to bring <4Kt his point, he cited as
an example of this our appreciation
of "small talk" as an art. In Europe,
he said, "small talk" is frowned
upon as trivial and insincere.
Moreover, we seem to appre
ciate a hookworm only il he com
pensates for his academic earnest
ness by I'u I fil I in,*; our stereotype
of a "-regular guy," and tend to
label anyone with a serious di
versity of opinion as "odd."
Many Europeans also find in
America a strong emphasis on pop

ularity, or what Erik calls "mar
ket im; personality," a habit of judg
ing one's own success Ijy oilier peo
ple's opinions.
"For example," lie laughed, "the
Institute of International Education
handbook for foreign students states

emphatically, 'When in the United
States, smile and you'll be popu
lar'."
At the same time, Erik, who

plans to become an American citi
zen eventually himself, agreed
that Europeans nflcn go too far
in the other extreme, try too hard
to he sincere and serious.
"I can't say often enough," he re
peated, "how profound an admira
tion I have for this country. How
ever much I criticize, I know that
its advantages more than counter
balance any defects."
Continuing his comparisons nf
the two civilizations, Erik sug
gested that Americans have con
tributed little that is truly origi
nal in painting, sculpture, or mu
sic. partially because tlicv lack an
environment or tradition of cul
ture.
While we emphasize modernity
and comfort in our physical sur
roundings, Erik's college, the Neth
erlands College for Foreign Serv
ice, is housed in a 200-year-old cas
tle, romantically complete with me
dieval tower, battlements, and moat.
At the same time, American au
thors, particularly the modern
short-story writers, such as Ca
pote, Hemingway, and Steinbeck,
have contributed a quality that is
all "American" to the world's lit
erature, commented the enthusi
astic fan of these realists.
Americans deserve much praise
for their optimism, their willing
ness to work hard, said the inter
national relations major. They
know that their dynamic economy
will reward hard work with suc
cess. In contrast, in Europe promo
tion and advancement follow a stat
ic hierarchical pattern. Young men
can succeed only slowly, step by
step, along a traditional ladder.
One interesting suggestion which
Eric brings with him from his home
college is a system of grading for
extra-curricular activities and so
cial conduct. In contrast to many
European schools at which academ
ic work is all important, at his col
lege students received credit for ac
tivities which do not contribute di
rectly to academic progress.
Born and raised in Java, Eric
learned his perfect English while
interned in a Japanese prison camp.
He received his high-school educa
tion from fellow internees, in
classes conducted while on constant
watch for Japanese guards.

In America a relative lack of
originality, tradition, and cultu
ral heritage is more than com
pensated for by optimism, infor
mality, and a flexible class struc
lure, generalized Erik van Ga
len, ASSU Foreign Scholar,
prefacing a comparison of Eu
rope and America.
Ilcre in "the most sociable nation
in the world," explained the tall,
husky Dutch student, "social play
follows strictly regulated patterns."
Admitting that he was exaggerating
to bring <4Kt his point, he cited as
an example of this our appreciation
of "small talk" as an art. In Europe,
he said, "small talk" is frowned
upon as trivial and insincere.
Moreover, we seem to appre
ciate a hookworm only il he com
pensates for his academic earnest
ness by I'u I fil I in,*; our stereotype
of a "-regular guy," and tend to
label anyone with a serious di
versity of opinion as "odd."
Many Europeans also find in
America a strong emphasis on pop

ularity, or what Erik calls "mar
ket im; personality," a habit of judg
ing one's own success Ijy oilier peo
ple's opinions.
"For example," lie laughed, "the
Institute of International Education
handbook for foreign students states

emphatically, 'When in the United
States, smile and you'll be popu
lar'."
At the same time, Erik, who

plans to become an American citi
zen eventually himself, agreed
that Europeans nflcn go too far
in the other extreme, try too hard
to he sincere and serious.
"I can't say often enough," he re
peated, "how profound an admira
tion I have for this country. How
ever much I criticize, I know that
its advantages more than counter
balance any defects."
Continuing his comparisons nf
the two civilizations, Erik sug
gested that Americans have con
tributed little that is truly origi
nal in painting, sculpture, or mu
sic. partially because tlicv lack an
environment or tradition of cul
ture.
While we emphasize modernity
and comfort in our physical sur
roundings, Erik's college, the Neth
erlands College for Foreign Serv
ice, is housed in a 200-year-old cas
tle, romantically complete with me
dieval tower, battlements, and moat.
At the same time, American au
thors, particularly the modern
short-story writers, such as Ca
pote, Hemingway, and Steinbeck,
have contributed a quality that is
all "American" to the world's lit
erature, commented the enthusi
astic fan of these realists.
Americans deserve much praise
for their optimism, their willing
ness to work hard, said the inter
national relations major. They
know that their dynamic economy
will reward hard work with suc
cess. In contrast, in Europe promo
tion and advancement follow a stat
ic hierarchical pattern. Young men
can succeed only slowly, step by
step, along a traditional ladder.
One interesting suggestion which
Eric brings with him from his home
college is a system of grading for
extra-curricular activities and so
cial conduct. In contrast to many
European schools at which academ
ic work is all important, at his col
