## Top Court Gets Seizure Dispute 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 12 (UP) â€”The government's chief attorney
was peppered with a barrage of hostile questions from five of the
nine supreme court justices today as the historic steel seizure
battle opened before the nation's highest tribunal.
Acting Attorney General Philip B. Perlman appeared to run into

trouble with the court when he failed
to cite specific laws which he said j
gave President Truman authority to
seize the steel industry last April 8
to prevent a strike by the CIO
United Steolworkers.
Perlman defended Mr. Truman's
action before an intent, jampacked
court room after the famous con
stitutional lawyer, John W. Davis,
argued the industry's claim that the
President's seizure was illegal and a j
"usurpation" of power.
Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson
and justices Robert 11. Jackson, j
William O. Douglas, Harold 11.
Burton and Felix Frankfurter cut
in at various times with questions
that at times appeared to put Perl
man on the defensive. lie appealed
to them at one point to "let me j
finish."
The specific issue before the court J
was the government's request that j
il overthrow Federal Judge David A
Pine's decision that Mr. Truman's j
seizure of the industry was uncon
stitutional. Implicit in the case, how
ever, was the broad constitutional
question of just how much power the
President of the United States has. I
The court will not hand down a i
decision for a week or two and per
haps longer. It agreed to give the
CIO steelworkers an hour for argu
ment in the case.
