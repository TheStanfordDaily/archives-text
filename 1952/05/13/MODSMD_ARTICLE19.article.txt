# Wind Measurement by Radar Is Tonight's Lecture Topic
## 
### 
Methods for tracing the growth •
and motion of invisible clouds in |
the upper atmosphere by means of
radar will be explained by Dr. Os
wald G. Villard Jr., assistant pro
fessor of electrical engineering, ;• t
tonight's Tuesday Evening Series |
lecture in Memorial Auditorium at I
7:30.
From the motions of clouds upper
atmospheric winds may be deter- j
mined far above the greatest height j
ever reached by a sounding balloon, !
according to Dr. Villard.
He and graduate student Lau
rence Manning have perfected an- i
other technique for measuring these i
winds which depends on the meas- 1

' urement of the drift of the eleetri
| cal "smoke puffs" created by me
teors.
Since 15)46 Dr. Villard has also
; directed an Air Force project stud
ying new communication tcch
| niques. In 1D47 he was responsible
| for development at Stanford of a
radically simplified single-sideband
] radio transmitter.
After graduation from Yale Uni-
I versity Dr. Villard received the de
| gree of engineer from Stanford in
I 1943, and in 1945 the Ph.D. in elec
trical engineering. During the war
he became a senior staff member
jin the Radio Research Laboratory
' at Harvard University.
