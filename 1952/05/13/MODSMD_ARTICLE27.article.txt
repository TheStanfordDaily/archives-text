# Shadow of the Ivory Tower Still?

### 
The ruling handed down by the Board of
Trustees at its last monthly meeting to allow
political speakers on campus was a great step
out from under the shadow of Stanford's tra
ditional ivory tower protection.
The prevailing policy before the action had
been unrealistic, unwarranted, unjustified, un
fair.
'Under the new policy there is one qualifica

ment: the ruling states that during a presidential
election year "all sides of a question must be
presented on the platform during tire program."
For iron presidential election years, an effort
must be made to provide balance of points of
view "over the years."

But the rigidity of campaign schedules among
other things makes it extremely difficult to

together on the same program. Most of the top

priority candidates invited have had to decline.
Even with the added attraction ol radio and
TV coverage (which the board has refused to
allow) providing candidates with larger audi

forsee the difficulties that cropped up this year
in making suitable arrangements, setting dates

We think a review of the situation by the
Board would be appropriate and realistic. If

the impossibility of bringing participants to
