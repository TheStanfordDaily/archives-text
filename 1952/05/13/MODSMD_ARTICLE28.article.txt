### KIP TODD 
Jose Manlilla y Panlaloiiefl

Many years ago, long before people really gave a
d:.:nn. there lived, in Guatamala, a young man named
.10. - Mantilla y Pantalones. It was a rare day that
Jose did not get out of bed in the morning, look at
the newly risen sun, and say, "Gosh, but it's good
to j'i t out of bed and get into the world." The day
hardly passed that he did not remark as he got up
out of his chair from the bieaklast table, "Gosh, but
it's good to be out of that chair and into the world."
Hi:: mother could not remember the lime that Jose
had left the house to go to work that he did not say,
"(Josh, but it's good to get out of this damned house

and into the world."
Ji.se Mantilla y Pantalones was
always liappy to get out of one
place and into another. He never
looked back over his shoulder at
the past to think, "Oh, I wish that
I were back there now." And he
wa:, happier than hell about it.
His friends in the banana garden
where he worked had various
names for him:
"There goes Old Happy To Be
Cone," one would say.

"Here comes old Never Sorry to Leave," another
would shout.
''There's Old Kiss It OIT Jose," others would shout
in unison as he came over the hill and into the? banana
pardtn.
And (o all of these taunts Jose Mantilla y Pan
lalonts would replv, "You may very well shout and
c ry at me now, but the time will come when you
will have to leave, and then the shoe will be on the
other foot and the horse will he of :t different color."
.fuse's friends said "Balderdash!" and went back to
their bananas, little realizing the full import of
Jose's prophesy.
"W<ll, the years passed and Jose became older. He
became older the more the years passed. Jose's
friends noticed this and told him so: "Jose Mantilla y
Pantalones," they said, "you are getting older the
more the years pass." Jose realized this.
"Magawd!" he cried, "you're right. I am. I must
leave this banana garden and I will be glad of it."

"We knew you would be," his friends said.
Jose went home. His mother hnked at him with
sadness. "You are going' to leave," she guessed.
"The years have passed and the time for you to
leave the hrmana garden has come and you must go
out into the world to look for and find yourself."
"Yes, Mother," said Jose, "You are right."
"Alas!" cried bis mother, "My little Jose Mantilla y
Pantalones is leaving."
"Do not be sorry, Mother," said Jose, "for I am not."
"Ungrateful child," she wailed, "but before you go
I must give you this sealed envelope from your father
(bless him) who died these twelve long years ago."
Jose opened the envelope. He looked inside. He
put it to his ear. He listened. There was nothing else
he could do. He heard. "Magawd!" he said again,
"I knew it."
"You knew what?" asked his mother, wondering
whether dr not to send for a doctor.
First I must lind my friends and tell them too,"
said Jose. And he went out into the banana garden
and found his friends. They came up to him. They
followed him home. They brought their families.
"Now, Jose Mantilla y Pantalones, what is it you
have seen and heard in that envelope left you by your
father (bless him) dead these twelve long years?"
they asked.
"I found a small man. lie had a long heard and
was very wise. lie said so. He told rnc to leave the
hanrina garden, but not to he happy about it. He
told me that the world is hard, that life is rough,
(hat ideals will l.e lost, that hope will he hard to
lind, that there are devils everywhere. He told me
that I must not forget the things that I have learned
here at the banana garden, for they will he useful
all the rest of my life. He told me that the banana
garden obviously symbolized Stanford University."
Just then a bolt of lightening struck the banana
garden. A fire started and it burned the banana
garden to the ground, killing Jose Mantilla y Pan
talones, his friends, and his mother. As he died, the
friends of Jose Mantilla y Pantalones looked at him
and said, shaking their fists, "The shoe is indeed, on
the other foot and the horse is indeed of a different
color, but we're glad now to be dying, for we have
learned the truth."
AND THE TRUTH: Tis better lo be dead than
drafted.

said Jose. And he went out into the banana garden
and found his friends. They came up to him. They
followed him home. They brought their families.
"Now, Jose Mantilla y Pantalones, what is it you
have seen and heard in that envelope left you by your
father (bless him) dead these twelve long years?"
they asked.
"I found a small man. lie had a long heard and
was very wise. lie said so. He told rnc to leave the
hanrina garden, but not to he happy about it. He
told me that the world is hard, that life is rough,
(hat ideals will l.e lost, that hope will he hard to
lind, that there are devils everywhere. He told me
that I must not forget the things that I have learned
here at the banana garden, for they will he useful
all the rest of my life. He told me that the banana
garden obviously symbolized Stanford University."
Just then a bolt of lightening struck the banana
garden. A fire started and it burned the banana
garden to the ground, killing Jose Mantilla y Pan
talones, his friends, and his mother. As he died, the
friends of Jose Mantilla y Pantalones looked at him
and said, shaking their fists, "The shoe is indeed, on
the other foot and the horse is indeed of a different
color, but we're glad now to be dying, for we have
learned the truth."
AND THE TRUTH: Tis better lo be dead than
drafted.

Jose Manlilla y Panlaloiiefl

Many years ago, long before people really gave a
d:.:nn. there lived, in Guatamala, a young man named
.10. - Mantilla y Pantalones. It was a rare day that
Jose did not get out of bed in the morning, look at
the newly risen sun, and say, "Gosh, but it's good
to j'i t out of bed and get into the world." The day
hardly passed that he did not remark as he got up
out of his chair from the bieaklast table, "Gosh, but
it's good to be out of that chair and into the world."
Hi:: mother could not remember the lime that Jose
had left the house to go to work that he did not say,
"(Josh, but it's good to get out of this damned house

and into the world."
Ji.se Mantilla y Pantalones was
always liappy to get out of one
place and into another. He never
looked back over his shoulder at
the past to think, "Oh, I wish that
I were back there now." And he
wa:, happier than hell about it.
His friends in the banana garden
where he worked had various
names for him:
"There goes Old Happy To Be
Cone," one would say.

"Here comes old Never Sorry to Leave," another
would shout.
''There's Old Kiss It OIT Jose," others would shout
in unison as he came over the hill and into the? banana
pardtn.
And (o all of these taunts Jose Mantilla y Pan
lalonts would replv, "You may very well shout and
c ry at me now, but the time will come when you
will have to leave, and then the shoe will be on the
other foot and the horse will he of :t different color."
.fuse's friends said "Balderdash!" and went back to
their bananas, little realizing the full import of
Jose's prophesy.
"W<ll, the years passed and Jose became older. He
became older the more the years passed. Jose's
friends noticed this and told him so: "Jose Mantilla y
Pantalones," they said, "you are getting older the
more the years pass." Jose realized this.
"Magawd!" he cried, "you're right. I am. I must
leave this banana garden and I will be glad of it."

"We knew you would be," his friends said.
Jose went home. His mother hnked at him with
sadness. "You are going' to leave," she guessed.
"The years have passed and the time for you to
leave the hrmana garden has come and you must go
out into the world to look for and find yourself."
"Yes, Mother," said Jose, "You are right."
"Alas!" cried bis mother, "My little Jose Mantilla y
Pantalones is leaving."
"Do not be sorry, Mother," said Jose, "for I am not."
"Ungrateful child," she wailed, "but before you go
I must give you this sealed envelope from your father
(bless him) who died these twelve long years ago."
Jose opened the envelope. He looked inside. He
put it to his ear. He listened. There was nothing else
he could do. He heard. "Magawd!" he said again,
"I knew it."
"You knew what?" asked his mother, wondering
whether dr not to send for a doctor.

"W<ll, the years passed and Jose became older. He
became older the more the years passed. Jose's
friends noticed this and told him so: "Jose Mantilla y
Pantalones," they said, "you are getting older the
more the years pass." Jose realized this.
"Magawd!" he cried, "you're right. I am. I must
leave this banana garden and I will be glad of it."

"We knew you would be," his friends said.
Jose went home. His mother hnked at him with
sadness. "You are going' to leave," she guessed.
"The years have passed and the time for you to
leave the hrmana garden has come and you must go
out into the world to look for and find yourself."
"Yes, Mother," said Jose, "You are right."
"Alas!" cried bis mother, "My little Jose Mantilla y
Pantalones is leaving."
"Do not be sorry, Mother," said Jose, "for I am not."
"Ungrateful child," she wailed, "but before you go
I must give you this sealed envelope from your father
(bless him) who died these twelve long years ago."
Jose opened the envelope. He looked inside. He
put it to his ear. He listened. There was nothing else
he could do. He heard. "Magawd!" he said again,
"I knew it."
"You knew what?" asked his mother, wondering
whether dr not to send for a doctor.
First I must lind my friends and tell them too,"
said Jose. And he went out into the banana garden
and found his friends. They came up to him. They
followed him home. They brought their families.
"Now, Jose Mantilla y Pantalones, what is it you
have seen and heard in that envelope left you by your
father (bless him) dead these twelve long years?"
they asked.
"I found a small man. lie had a long heard and
was very wise. lie said so. He told rnc to leave the
hanrina garden, but not to he happy about it. He
told me that the world is hard, that life is rough,
(hat ideals will l.e lost, that hope will he hard to
lind, that there are devils everywhere. He told me
that I must not forget the things that I have learned
here at the banana garden, for they will he useful
all the rest of my life. He told me that the banana
garden obviously symbolized Stanford University."
Just then a bolt of lightening struck the banana
garden. A fire started and it burned the banana
garden to the ground, killing Jose Mantilla y Pan
talones, his friends, and his mother. As he died, the
friends of Jose Mantilla y Pantalones looked at him
and said, shaking their fists, "The shoe is indeed, on
the other foot and the horse is indeed of a different
color, but we're glad now to be dying, for we have
learned the truth."
AND THE TRUTH: Tis better lo be dead than
drafted.

Jose Manlilla y Panlaloiiefl

Many years ago, long before people really gave a
d:.:nn. there lived, in Guatamala, a young man named
.10. - Mantilla y Pantalones. It was a rare day that
Jose did not get out of bed in the morning, look at
the newly risen sun, and say, "Gosh, but it's good
to j'i t out of bed and get into the world." The day
hardly passed that he did not remark as he got up
out of his chair from the bieaklast table, "Gosh, but
it's good to be out of that chair and into the world."
Hi:: mother could not remember the lime that Jose
had left the house to go to work that he did not say,
"(Josh, but it's good to get out of this damned house

and into the world."
Ji.se Mantilla y Pantalones was
always liappy to get out of one
place and into another. He never
looked back over his shoulder at
the past to think, "Oh, I wish that
I were back there now." And he
wa:, happier than hell about it.
His friends in the banana garden
where he worked had various
names for him:
"There goes Old Happy To Be
Cone," one would say.

"Here comes old Never Sorry to Leave," another
would shout.
''There's Old Kiss It OIT Jose," others would shout
in unison as he came over the hill and into the? banana
pardtn.
And (o all of these taunts Jose Mantilla y Pan
lalonts would replv, "You may very well shout and
c ry at me now, but the time will come when you
will have to leave, and then the shoe will be on the
other foot and the horse will he of :t different color."
.fuse's friends said "Balderdash!" and went back to
their bananas, little realizing the full import of
Jose's prophesy.
