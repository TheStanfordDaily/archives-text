# Standard Is Interpreted, Evaluated by Committee
## 
### BARBARA TUERK 
Recent surveys have proved that almost any Stanford student
can rattle off a quick approximation of the Fundamental Standard,
"such respect for order, morality, personal honor, and the rights
of others as is demanded of good citizens."
And most students believe it thoroughly satisfactory as a basic

rule for social conduct.
But how many can cite specific
instances in which the Standard.ap
plies? How many know exactly
what it means?
The Committee*:; purpose, as
stated! in its constitution, is to
define, interpret, and evaluate the
Standard.
This winter quarter chronic
agitation against the unrealistic
Lone Woman Rule climaxed in a
general meeting of representatives
from AWS, Men's and Women's
Councils, Excom, the administra
tion and the Standard Committee.
At this meeting the Committee
was assigned the task of evaluating
the rule as it applied to current sit
uations, and, if it was found to be
outdated, the project of drawing up
a substitute.
Consequently, for the last quar
ter and a half the committee lias
met for many hours each week,
drawing up statements of policy
in specific problem areas.
Among the specific situations to
which they have applied the Stand
ard are liquor, publications, dra
matic performances, conduct at
dances, entertainment at parties,
and situations both on and off the«
campus.
This outline will he presented
to Excom for approval before the
end of the quarter. It is meant as
a constructive interpretation of
the meaning of the Standard, not
as a series of "dos" and "don'ts"
for the students.
Upon approval it will be given
proper publicity and printed up in a
social conduct booklet for freshmen
and new students. In the same
booklet will be included an expla

nation of (lie Honor Code, the ap
plication of the Standard to aca
demics.
In addition to (his re-evaluation
of the Standard the Committee
tarries on such routine tasks as
attending Men's and Women's
Council meetings to interpret the
Standard as it applies to specific
cases, supervising a program in
which freshman English students
write a theme on "What the Fun
damental Standard Means to Me,"
taking part in freshman and
transfer orientation programs, and
conducting occasional evaluation
surveys.
A typical by-product of the Com
mittee's work is the recent waiving
of the Lone Woman Rule for semi
nars in which only one woman was
enrolled.
Chairman of the Committee this
year has been Dick Klein. Work
ing with him have been Tom
Blount, Mary Spiegel, Emmie Lou
Fredhold, Joyce Bryson, and Susie
Reichert.

general meeting of representatives
from AWS, Men's and Women's
Councils, Excom, the administra
tion and the Standard Committee.
At this meeting the Committee
was assigned the task of evaluating
the rule as it applied to current sit
uations, and, if it was found to be
outdated, the project of drawing up
a substitute.
Consequently, for the last quar
ter and a half the committee lias
met for many hours each week,
drawing up statements of policy
in specific problem areas.
Among the specific situations to
which they have applied the Stand
ard are liquor, publications, dra
matic performances, conduct at
dances, entertainment at parties,
and situations both on and off the«
campus.
This outline will he presented
to Excom for approval before the
end of the quarter. It is meant as
a constructive interpretation of
the meaning of the Standard, not
as a series of "dos" and "don'ts"
for the students.
Upon approval it will be given
proper publicity and printed up in a
social conduct booklet for freshmen
and new students. In the same
booklet will be included an expla

nation of (lie Honor Code, the ap
plication of the Standard to aca
demics.
In addition to (his re-evaluation
of the Standard the Committee
tarries on such routine tasks as
attending Men's and Women's
Council meetings to interpret the
Standard as it applies to specific
cases, supervising a program in
which freshman English students
write a theme on "What the Fun
damental Standard Means to Me,"
taking part in freshman and
transfer orientation programs, and
conducting occasional evaluation
surveys.
A typical by-product of the Com
mittee's work is the recent waiving
of the Lone Woman Rule for semi
nars in which only one woman was
enrolled.
Chairman of the Committee this
year has been Dick Klein. Work
ing with him have been Tom
Blount, Mary Spiegel, Emmie Lou
Fredhold, Joyce Bryson, and Susie
Reichert.
Recent surveys have proved that almost any Stanford student
can rattle off a quick approximation of the Fundamental Standard,
"such respect for order, morality, personal honor, and the rights
of others as is demanded of good citizens."
And most students believe it thoroughly satisfactory as a basic

rule for social conduct.
But how many can cite specific
instances in which the Standard.ap
plies? How many know exactly
what it means?
The Committee*:; purpose, as
stated! in its constitution, is to
define, interpret, and evaluate the
Standard.
This winter quarter chronic
agitation against the unrealistic
Lone Woman Rule climaxed in a
general meeting of representatives
from AWS, Men's and Women's
Councils, Excom, the administra
tion and the Standard Committee.
