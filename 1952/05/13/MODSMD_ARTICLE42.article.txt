# Indian Oarsmen Win Again
## 
### 
Saturday morning the Stanford
varsity and junior varsity crews
raced to their third consecutive vic
tories, this week's victims being the
UCLA crews. Led by sophomore
coxswain Jim Stockton, Coach Bob
White's varsity boat easily stroked
the 2,000-meter course in 0:07 min
utes, beating the Bruin shell by
three lengths.
Coach Dave Draves' jayvee boat,
with coxswain Willis Potter at the
helm, swept past the UCLA shell
by four lengths. The jayvees' time
of (kIG minutes equaled that set by
the UCLA varsity.
Prior to the twin races, the oars
men, with the help of a group of
Japanese exchange students, chris
tened a now shell donated by alum
nus George Mizota. The boat,
named the "Mizota," was built in
Japan at the donor's own shipyard.
Coach Bob White was not par
ticularly satisfied with the varsity's
performance, despite their easy vic

tory. He was worried about the
bout washing out too much and the
beat being too high. Another good
reason for White's concern was the
performance of the Cal crew, per
ennial PCC champions, who turned
in an easy victory over OSC in (i:O3
minutes.
The crew meets Cal in three
weeks and, according to White,
there will be a Ipt of work for the
Indians before then. The races
on the crew's schedule include a
four-way derby between Stanford,
UCLA, USC, and Cal at Newport
Beach on May 24, then the National
Regatta in June, and, if funds hold
out, the Olympic trials at the end
of that month.
Oarsmen in the varsity boat were:
Stockton at cox; Bill Find ley,
stroke; Dixon Smith, No. 7; Matt
Schmutz, No. G; George Toepfer,
No. 5; Morg Sanborn, No. 4; Bill
Fairchild, No. 3; Dick Flynn, No. 2;
and Stan Lewis at bow.
