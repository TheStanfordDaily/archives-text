### PHIL BERMAN 
Eleven in a row—when will it ever end?
Coach Dick Cleqg and his Braves certainly hope that it will not
be soon, as they ballooned their win skein at the expense oi Cal's
Cinnamon Bears at Edwards Field Saturday inorniny.
The jayvees took the well-played affair 6 to 2, and also took
the season's scries from their CJii Ii- ♦

fornia counterparts, two panics to |
one.
Brilliant in victory for the Braves
were pitcher Gil Duncan and sec
ond baseman Hog Irvine. Gil was
the victorious moundsman as he
blanked the Cal nine on three hit
in the first six innings, while Hog
butted home Jour runs with a
homer arid a single.
The Braves never trailed in the
game as they grabbed a one-run
lead in the top ol the second, thanks
to a collapse of the Cal battery.
Duncan worked the Cal starter, Nat
Short, for a base on halls and he
traipsed lo second on a passed ball.
Ralph Cussady also drew a pass and
both runners moved up as Bob
Burdick beat out a bunt. On the
first pitch to Irvine, southpaw Short
threw the hall over the catcher's
head and Gil trotted home.
Three more runs tallied in the
fifth again due lo Short's lack ol
control. For the second time in a
row lie walked Duncan. Cassady
sacrificed Gil to second and wa.s
safe as Short fumbled his bunt.
Burdick sacrificed successfully to
put runners on second and third,

anil bo 111 men scored on Irvine's
line drive over second. Hog scored
just a moment later on Evans's sin
gle to right and Nelson's infield out.
Irvine's lung home run in the
seventh ended the Braves' scoring.
Hi;* blow deep to center Held came
after Burdick had walked and sto
len second.
Lelty Stan Fetterman came on to
pitch in the last of the seventh for
the jayvees and allowed the Cal
runs. His control was not too shaip,
but he still had enough in the
clutch as lie stranded five men on
Luse in the last two innings.
The win continued the remaili
able iy'-cord that Duncan has main
tained this year for the Braves. In
a total of 115 innings ol pitcliine, he
has allowed hut three earned runs.
