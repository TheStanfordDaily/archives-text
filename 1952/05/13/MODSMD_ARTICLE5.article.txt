the JofTre medal at 7 last night in
Wheeler Auditorium, Berkeley.
Bruce Bailey, junior; Alan En

and the three Cal representatives
were given two hours to pre
pare a stand on a specific topic un
der the general subject, "Radicalism
in French Politics." Debaters will be
judged on an individual basis, and
the winner's school will be declared
the victor.
The totals to date are Stanford 150,
Cal 27. Stanford has won the event
for the past three years.
Each debater is alloted 15 minutes
for debate and 7 for rebuttal, in
which he may harangue opponents.
The debate originated in 1894.
when Baron de Coubertin endowed
the medal. He hoped the competition
"might direct the attention of stu
dents to the efforts which the French
people are making in the cause of
progress."
The French Consulate in San
Francisco will present the medal.
