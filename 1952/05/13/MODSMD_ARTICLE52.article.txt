Would you like a dorm com
plete with landscaped patio, a
j fountain and fish pond, and a
terrace for outdoor dancing?
If so, Lagunita, surrounding a
spacious court that is open to
residents even after closing
hours, is the place for you.
Approximately 370 women live
under the same roof in six separate
ca.vas. These contain from 45 to 8(
residents in singles, doubles, o:
triples. Each unit elects its own
president and, except for formal:?

The following living units will
he open from !> to 5 this week:
Today—L;v*unita, Ventura
May l'l—Union and Units
May 15—Branncr
May lti—Lower Row

! and a few all-hall functions car
ries on individual social activities.
Each casa has a social room with
j \ radio and phonograph, and a
kitchenette. Several of them have
pianos and small libraries. Two in
dividual features of Lag are a pho
tographic darkroom and a record
j collection consisting of several hun
|di ed classical records.
All meals here are served in
one big dining hall. Lac has Ben
dixes and dryers plus a pick-up
; and delivery laundry and dry
cleaning service. There arc two
: "holes" (small snack stores) and
facilities for ping pong and vol
leyball.
Since Lag is just across the street
from the Women's Gym, the girls
can make their one afternoon class
without changing to Quad clothes.
And with the rear casas practically
bordering the lakeshore, the girls*
often desert their own walled-in
sun porches for the crowded boat
fleck, where Lag boasts three ca
noes for those who crave the wind
and the waves.


LAGUNITA COURT —The seven casas of Lagunita Court lie
across the street from the Women's Gym.
