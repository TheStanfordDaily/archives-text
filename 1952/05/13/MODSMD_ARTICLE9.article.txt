The Spring Show, "Finian's Rain
bow," boasts in its cast a group of
characters that can be found only
in dreams, imagination, or a musical.
There are people like Senator Bill
board Rawkins. He, poor man, wants
nothing more than to relax with a
mint julep, but, by the time the
drink arrives, he is so upset over
something or another that the julep
is traded in for a Bromo-Seltzer.
The Senator, a satire on crooked
government men, has never read the
United States Constitution. His
reason? He's too busy defending it!
()g. the Icprct'haun who is turn
ing into a mortal, presents a singu
lar problem. He is changing slow
ly, from the feet up. At first, the
only mortal tag to his appearance
is a pair of golf shoes and argyle
socks, but, as the play continues,
the rest of his body continues
changing, and his fairy garments
and characteristics are exchanged
for human ones.
Other characters include: Susan,
the deaf mute who talks with her
dancing feet; Buzz Collins, the shifty
stooge of Senator Rawkins; Mr.
Shears and Mr. Robust, the famous
mail-order catalog men; and Henry,
one of the most appealing of children.

The Spring Show, "Finian's Rain
bow," boasts in its cast a group of
characters that can be found only
in dreams, imagination, or a musical.
There are people like Senator Bill
board Rawkins. He, poor man, wants
nothing more than to relax with a
mint julep, but, by the time the
drink arrives, he is so upset over
something or another that the julep
is traded in for a Bromo-Seltzer.
The Senator, a satire on crooked
government men, has never read the
United States Constitution. His
reason? He's too busy defending it!
()g. the Icprct'haun who is turn
ing into a mortal, presents a singu
lar problem. He is changing slow
ly, from the feet up. At first, the
only mortal tag to his appearance
is a pair of golf shoes and argyle
socks, but, as the play continues,
the rest of his body continues
changing, and his fairy garments
and characteristics are exchanged
for human ones.
Other characters include: Susan,
the deaf mute who talks with her
dancing feet; Buzz Collins, the shifty
stooge of Senator Rawkins; Mr.
Shears and Mr. Robust, the famous
mail-order catalog men; and Henry,
one of the most appealing of children.
