barrassed U.S. Arrny hinted that it will repudiate most or all con
cessions made for the release of Brig. Gen. Francis T. Dodd to
Communist war prisoners who held him hostage on Koje Island.
Brig. Gen. Charles F. Colson, the man who knuckled under to

the Fed demands, was fired
hi.s job as commander of the Koje i
Island POW camp.
The U.S. Joint Chiefs of StafT 1
demanded an "explanation" of the |
whole affair, including the seizure J
of Dodd -former camp commander |
—by the unruly Red prisoners.
Dodd himself was yanked out of |
the prison camp administration and
"reassigned" to unspecified duties
with the Eighth Army headquarters
in Seoul.
Gen. flfiark Clark, new United
Nations supreme commander for
Korea, charged in a sharply worded

mail."
He hinted strongly that the con
troversial and confusing concessions j
made by Colson would not be lion- |
