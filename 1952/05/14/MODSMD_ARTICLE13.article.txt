## 
### 
The University of California triumphed in a heated Joffre Debate
last night at Cal. Top debater was Robert Daggett of UC with Don
aid Cahen, UC, second, and Stanford's Thomas Bailey third.
The six debaters participating were not informed of the topic
until 6 p.m. yesterday, when they hastily began preparing their

♦\alks. The topic was "Resolved,
that in the present crisis the De
Gaulle party will best serve the in
terests of France."
Daggett maintained that there
would be no gain to France in go
ing back to a fascist attitude, and
that a strong middle party through
compromise would best insure the
continuance of a republican-demo
cratic form of government.
Mejid Kedaili, French consul,
presented the JolTre medal to Dag
gett. Dr. Charles Marsh ol the Cal
speech department acted as moder
ator.
Contrary to the usual procedure,
the speakers were allbtcd a Lime
limit which they could proportion
out to either speech or rebuttal. In
the past a limit, has been set for
both parts.
It was felt that Bailey's rebuttal,
| rapidly given, was superior, but
i that Daggett's well - organized
I speech gave him the necessary mar-
I gin for top honors.
