# Juleps, Roosters Prop Problems
## 
### 
While the cast of "Finian's Hainbow" (which opens tomorrow
night in Mem Aud) struggles to learn Ihcir line:; and lunes, the
technical staff, headed by Steve Stevens, has its own problems
to tackle.
The students who hoist scenery, tinker with lights, and clean-up

have the advantage of working on a*
sl.Hge that is superior in size and |
(.• r| uipm en t. to most Broadway j
stupes, according to Stevens.
In his opinion, "Finian's Rain- j
bow" will he given a better techni- |
cal production at Stanford than in ;
I New York, where, with Ella Ly;;;m
as Sharon and David Wayne as < >g.
I the mifical ran for nunc than 500 1
j performances.
The"famous rainbow was ;m easy i
I job for lighting : preialists, but
I Buck< 1 Christiansen, property pu
■ pet intendent, has had harder tasks
with props.
Props include a synthetic rooster, j
pumpkin heads (that had to be |
band-made), a wooden fwiny (also j
, hand-ma' e), and mint-julep glasses.
The latter caused much difficulty,
i as virtually none of the students
j knew what a mint julep glass looked
j like.
Many of the workers on the tech- 1
nieal staff are not speech and drama
majors, but are specializing in such
subjects as nursing, French, and j
j pre-med.
However, almost all of them j
| spend from five to seven hours daily
working on sets, costumes, lights,
and properties. The spirit of the
show seems to have infected them,
, as they hum, whistle, or sing the ,
! show's melodies while working.
Tickets for the musical are being
sold in front of the Cellar and in the ;
Memorial Theater box office. They
arc still available for all three per
i formanccs.
