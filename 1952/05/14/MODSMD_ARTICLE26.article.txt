# Supreme Court Snaps At Federal Attorneys
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 13 (UP) Supreme Court Justices hurled
a second round of hostile questions at Acting Attorney General
Philip B. Perlman today and then retired to hrnd down a final
ruling on the historic steel seizure issue.
The decision may be handed down in a week or two.

Before taking the momentous*
question under advisement, the [
Justice:; also reminded Arthur •) >
Goldberg, attorney for the CIO
United Steelworkers, that the only I
issue was whether Mi. Truman .
"had the power or did not have '
the power" to seize the industry to
prevent a strike.
Their linr. of questioning indi- j
cate« that the tribunal may rule I
directly on the constitutional
question at stake and •-nell out f< vi
the first time the power of U.S.
Presidents to act in an emer
gency. It is possible, however, the
case may he sent to lower courts J
for further study.
The court took the case under (
advisement after hearing reven I
hours of oral arguments by Perl
man, 79-year-old John W. Davi::,
representing the :.teel industry, i
Goldberg, and three railroad hroth- <
erhoods v/hich, paradoxically, sided ;
with the steel industry in the dis- I
pute. i
As on opening day, Perlman whs
interrupted frequently by five of '
the nine Justices as he asserted that '
Mr. Truman had no other course '
but to seize the steel mills to pre- '
vent a strike by the 050,000 CIO 1
steelworkers.
While the questions asked by
Justices during oral arguments
are not necessarily an indication
of their opinion, the Justices
again appeared to have Perlman i
on the defensive.
i
Without hinting when the court '
might, rule, Justice Robert H. -Jack- 1
son cautioned Goldberg and the 1
union against "false hopes" that the
tribunal might hand down a brief '
early decision and then follow it
later with written opinions.
