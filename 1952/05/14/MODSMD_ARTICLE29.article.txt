# Professor Tells Uses Of Radar
## 
### 
Although mo:,t laymen think of
astronomy and weather prediction
in terms of what can be .seen -ei
ther by the naked eye or by teie
scope—very few know what vast
possibilities the u; e of radio waves
has opened up.
Dr. Oswald CI. Vi)lard Jr., assist
ant professor of electrical engineer
ing, explained some of the methods
of u; in t; these waves and their ap
plication to last night's Tuesday
Evening Series audience in Memo
rial Auditorium.
Some of the widest experiment
ing in this field has been in the use
of radar, which involves tending
out radio waves that will bounce
oft substances capable of conduct
ing electricity. Returning wave.,
can be observed in the cathode ray
tube in a receiving set.
In astronomy scientists have been
able to discover innumerable Ltars
an l meteors which could not be de
lected by even the most powerful
telescope.
Dr. Villard also explained how
he has been experimenting to de
termine the direction of movement
of winds in the ionosphere — the
layer of air from 60 to 200 miles
above the surface of the earth.
Blob; of dust particles are blown
along in the air as well as meteors.
By following the paths of these dust
and meteor trails, scientists can de
termine wind velocity and direc
tion. Thus radar may eventually
provide a key to more efficient
weather forecasting.
