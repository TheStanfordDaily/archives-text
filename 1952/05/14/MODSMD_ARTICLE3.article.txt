PHILADELPHIAâ€”CIO President
I Philip Murray told the steel indus
try to "go to hell" today and ac
cused the companies of violating
the "rules of common decency."
In a blistering opening address to
3,000 at the United Steelvvorkers'
sixth biennial convention, Murray
made it clear that the union will
insist on getting the entire 2(i cents
an hour increase recommended by
the Wage Stabilization Board.
He blasted management for try
ing to bargain down the thrce-in-
I stallment wage and fringe raise
I proposed by the board.
