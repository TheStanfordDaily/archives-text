The class of '54 will host the Cal
sophomores at a picnic Sunday.
Activities will begin at noon with
boat races at Lake Lag.
Refreshments will be served, and
softball and volleyball games will
be played later at Rossotti's.
The outing will be similar to the
recent exchange between Cal and
Stanford freshman classes. Two
hundred fifty Cal sophs are expect
ed to attend.
