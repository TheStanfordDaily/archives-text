# For a Better Impression of America
## 
### 
In Cubberley auditorium tonight, the Institute
of International Relations starts the wheels
rolling on a new and far-sighted orientation
program for foreign students, and to make the
program a success, the assistance of many Stan
ford students will be required.
The lIR is attempting to set up a minimal
pre-registration and orientation program for
the 150 to 250 students from abroad v/ho will
enroll next fall. The backbone oi these plans
v/ill be student "hosts" who will, in their
spare time, help foreign students learn their
way around the Farm.
Tonight's program will be the first of two
which will "pre"-orient those students who will
act as hosts next fall. To this end, Drs. Claude
Buss and F. M. Keesing will offer advice on
what hosts should and should not do when they
assist the students from abroad.
The need for hosts who will help orient the
foreign students next fall is acute, for the "or
ganized confusion" of registering in Stanford
is a hazard even to American students.
The time required to participate in the pro
gram is little. The host will simply spend some
of his spare time in the first week of school
helping his counterpart from abroad through
reg lines and showing him around Stanford.
The idea is simply to give those many for
eign students some student adviser and the
feeling that someone is looking out for him
who will help him out in a pinch.
The lIR will assign the student advisers to

the foreign students primarily according to the
department of study. Director of the program,
Bob lessen, reports the acutest need is for men
student hosts who will be either seniors or in
graduate study next fall.
Students who are interested in the host pro
gram and who cannot make the special meet
ing being held tonight at 7:30 in Cubberley,
may get more information at the Institute of In
ternational Relations Shack during weekday
afternoons.
This orientation program is, we feel, vitally
important. At Stanford, the job is being tackled
almost entirely by students—in other universi
ties paid university personnel handle the job.
The student host program provides a rare op
portunity for friendship besides giving to for
eign students a more correct impression of
America a definiie need in this day and age.
* * *
The lIR, among many other things, has found
time to put out a little booklet, "Introduction to
Europe and Latin America, summer, 1952."
which will bo invaluable to any student travel
ing out of the country this summer. The book
let includes general information (on such items
as tipping and taxis), what to see, things to do,
and individuals to contact who are familiar with
Stanford.
The publication is a steal—it costs nothing.
And you can pick it up at the lIR Shack.

This orientation program is, we feel, vitally
important. At Stanford, the job is being tackled
almost entirely by students—in other universi
ties paid university personnel handle the job.
The student host program provides a rare op
portunity for friendship besides giving to for

America a definiie need in this day and age.

The lIR, among many other things, has found
time to put out a little booklet, "Introduction to
Europe and Latin America, summer, 1952."
which will bo invaluable to any student travel
ing out of the country this summer. The book
let includes general information (on such items
as tipping and taxis), what to see, things to do,
and individuals to contact who are familiar with
Stanford.
The publication is a steal—it costs nothing.
And you can pick it up at the lIR Shack.

In Cubberley auditorium tonight, the Institute
of International Relations starts the wheels
rolling on a new and far-sighted orientation
program for foreign students, and to make the
program a success, the assistance of many Stan
ford students will be required.
The lIR is attempting to set up a minimal
pre-registration and orientation program for
the 150 to 250 students from abroad v/ho will
enroll next fall. The backbone oi these plans
v/ill be student "hosts" who will, in their
spare time, help foreign students learn their
way around the Farm.
Tonight's program will be the first of two
which will "pre"-orient those students who will
act as hosts next fall. To this end, Drs. Claude
Buss and F. M. Keesing will offer advice on
what hosts should and should not do when they
assist the students from abroad.
The need for hosts who will help orient the
foreign students next fall is acute, for the "or
ganized confusion" of registering in Stanford
is a hazard even to American students.
The time required to participate in the pro
gram is little. The host will simply spend some
of his spare time in the first week of school
helping his counterpart from abroad through
reg lines and showing him around Stanford.
The idea is simply to give those many for
eign students some student adviser and the
feeling that someone is looking out for him
who will help him out in a pinch.
The lIR will assign the student advisers to

the foreign students primarily according to the
department of study. Director of the program,
Bob lessen, reports the acutest need is for men
student hosts who will be either seniors or in
graduate study next fall.
Students who are interested in the host pro
gram and who cannot make the special meet
ing being held tonight at 7:30 in Cubberley,
may get more information at the Institute of In
ternational Relations Shack during weekday
afternoons.
