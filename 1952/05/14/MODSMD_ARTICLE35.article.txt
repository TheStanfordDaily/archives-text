IF . . . (FOK WOMFN)
IF you're just not quite a ravishing beauty,
But wholesome, and smart, and here,
And were told of the ratio,
And rich, handsome husbands,
Before you could even spell "Stanford."
When in high school, made up your mind,
On a dateless night when left behind,
By the rollicking, frolicking boys,
Who dated the "gaudier" sirens.
And said to yourself, "Wait and .see,"
Till the tables are turned one to three,
And put on your specks and studied . . .
IF 1 you hit poor daddy for a cool, even thousand,
To buy you a hunting outfit,
Of sweaters and shirts and formats,
And all of the feminine paraphernalia,
To sail down Quad in full regallia,
And just shop around while taking your lime,
Anil sneer at the men waiting in line,
And got here and found it was all true ...
IF you're damn sick and tired of kidding,
About being a "Beauty" in quotes,
Anil a pig out of quotes,
And know down deep in your heart,
That you're as beautiful as any.
(Down deep in your heart, that is.)
And know for all the ribbing,

That we're really only kidding,
You're all that we've got, we love you,
And San Jose State's too far . . .
IF you moved into Roble all young and holy,
Went to i\ fraternity party thereafter,
Were shocked at a joke mid the laughter,
But never let on, hiughed with the throng,
Went home and wrote mama a long letter,
Who didn't get the joke either.
And in the first three quarters of college,
Sought to know "life" and all knowledge,
Were impressed as a freshman by the glitter,
Of roaring cars, Jaguars, chrome bars,
And moved out of Roble, still holy, but wiser .
It you're in favor of things of the flavor,
Of: Keeping the ratio the way that is,
No sororitie:: but lots more fraternities,
Equal rights for women, after dinner frosties,
Strawberry short cake, weddings, pinnings,
Springtime, coeducation, more bonus time.
And against: free love, dieting, gym classes,
Girdles, the double standard, lockouts,
Nice mannered men who don't shave,
Smooth shaven men who don't behave . ..
IF I y a senior you've gotten the nod,
By tin? light of the moon been kissed on Quad,
Til FN you're a STANFOIII) WOMAN, by God . . .

And know down deep in your heart,
That you're as beautiful as any.
(Down deep in your heart, that is.)
And know for all the ribbing,

That we're really only kidding,
You're all that we've got, we love you,
And San Jose State's too far . . .
IF you moved into Roble all young and holy,
Went to i\ fraternity party thereafter,
Were shocked at a joke mid the laughter,
But never let on, hiughed with the throng,
Went home and wrote mama a long letter,
Who didn't get the joke either.
And in the first three quarters of college,
Sought to know "life" and all knowledge,
Were impressed as a freshman by the glitter,
Of roaring cars, Jaguars, chrome bars,
And moved out of Roble, still holy, but wiser .
It you're in favor of things of the flavor,
Of: Keeping the ratio the way that is,
No sororitie:: but lots more fraternities,
Equal rights for women, after dinner frosties,
Strawberry short cake, weddings, pinnings,
Springtime, coeducation, more bonus time.
And against: free love, dieting, gym classes,
Girdles, the double standard, lockouts,
Nice mannered men who don't shave,
Smooth shaven men who don't behave . ..
IF I y a senior you've gotten the nod,
By tin? light of the moon been kissed on Quad,
Til FN you're a STANFOIII) WOMAN, by God . . .
IF . . . (FOK WOMFN)
IF you're just not quite a ravishing beauty,
But wholesome, and smart, and here,
And were told of the ratio,
And rich, handsome husbands,
Before you could even spell "Stanford."
When in high school, made up your mind,
On a dateless night when left behind,
By the rollicking, frolicking boys,
Who dated the "gaudier" sirens.
And said to yourself, "Wait and .see,"
Till the tables are turned one to three,
And put on your specks and studied . . .
IF 1 you hit poor daddy for a cool, even thousand,
To buy you a hunting outfit,
Of sweaters and shirts and formats,
And all of the feminine paraphernalia,
To sail down Quad in full regallia,
And just shop around while taking your lime,
Anil sneer at the men waiting in line,
And got here and found it was all true ...
IF you're damn sick and tired of kidding,
About being a "Beauty" in quotes,
Anil a pig out of quotes,
And know down deep in your heart,
That you're as beautiful as any.
(Down deep in your heart, that is.)
And know for all the ribbing,

That we're really only kidding,
You're all that we've got, we love you,
