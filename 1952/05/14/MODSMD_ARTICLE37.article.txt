(Editor's note: This is the second in a series of articles on women's
living groups which are designed to give a general description of the
various residences for the women who will he drawing May 22.)

Twenty seconds from Quad! That's how far, or how close, Union
is to the center of campus activity. And if a person in Union Resi
dence or any of the six units should just happen to miss eight
o'clock breakfast, she need only walk around the corner to the
Cellar for that morning cup of black.
Vine-covered Union is the nucleus of six units —Madrono, Mari-

posa, Manzanita, Elm Cottage, Casa
E-panola, and Maison Francaise all
grouped around it at varying dis
tances.
Although the unit girls must walk
to their meals at' the main residence,
each house has a kitchenette for
preparing snacks. Union propel'
has Bendixes, but Madrono is the
only unit having a washing ma
chine so the other units must take
laundry there.
Union and the units have one
over-all director; a residence advis
er lives in each of the branches.
Both the units and the residence as
a whole present social functions,
but government is separate within
each of the houses.
Casa Espanola and Maison Fran
caise serve a unique function. They
were established primarily for
women interested in learning about
the Spanish or French language and
culture. Women wishing to live in
either of these must be approved
by the department before they
draw. Then they compete only with
others drawing into that house.


OUTDOOR DINING—When the sun shines spring quarter Un
ion Residence and Unit girls have the advantage of being able
to eat outside in a little patio adjoining the main dining room.
