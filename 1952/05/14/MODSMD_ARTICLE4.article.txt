Red China's radio voice challenged
the United Nations today to give in
on the prisoner exchange issue or
"formally declare the armistice ne
gotiations at an end."
North Korean Gen. Nam II was
quoted as telling the UN negotiators
to formally end the Korean truce
talks if "the Americans are deter
mined to wreck the armistice nego
tiations" by insisting on the return
of only 70,000 Communist prisoners.
