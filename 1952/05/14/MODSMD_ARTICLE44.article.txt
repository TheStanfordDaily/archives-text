With the major leaguers just settling dowVi to serious business, Coach
Everett De an and his hustling Indian diamond heroes are about to put
the finishing touches on the CIBA race. The finale is a two-game series
with that Southland semi-pro outfit called tin l USC Trojans.
'I he two contests. Friday and Saturday afternoons at Bovard Field, are
for all the marbles. Currently the two teams are knotted for both the CIBA
lead and the Southern Division crown. Each will be gunning for a double
victory, because a split would settle nothing and just necessitate a playoff.
Luckily, the Cards dropped their one loss out of three weekend con
tents tn Santa Clara instead of to Cal. If not, there could have been a real
mess in picking the local representative for the District 8 playoffs. Pres
ently there are no provisions for a situation when the CIBA winner is not
the same as the Southern Division titlist. But that's a problem for Vic
Schmidt, PCC mogul, and Clint Evans, District 8 selector, to stew about
in the future.
Coach Dean did fall into thai trap two years hack when his Cards
won the CIBA, hut were one game out of first in the regular conference
standings. Ania/ : n;,ly enough, the Trojans waived their rights and the
Curds headed to the big Northwest, only to blow the play-off to Washing
lon.
This last double-header victory over Cal gave the Indians a beautiful
clean sweep of a four-game series with the Bears. According to the Card
mentor, "The poise of our two pitchers, Roger Osenbaugh and Joe Chez,
had much to do with the double win. Both pitchers did a nice job in every
department against a team that was trying desperately to win and knock
us out of the league.
"With Osenbaugh and Chez improving on their performances against
California last Saturday, they.-can turn in two wins against the Trojans this
week. I feel that way and the whole team does." And nothing would make
the K; urn baseball filberts happier.
Another big factor in the past week-end showing was the return of
veteran infielder, Artie Abrahanison. The little Indian co-captain poured
cut six hits in ten trips for a big time at the plate and really helped the
run-producing column.
Mr. Dean rates the strong desire to win, and "to win this year" as the
team's main weapon in their tremendous late season splurge. The pitching
ha:: improved steadily and that has been a strong factor. The hitting has
been "all right" but should get better.
Just in case the Cards and Trojans do split, a one-game, sudden-death
playoff will be the clincher. The place has not been definitely set, but it
looks like the good, old Sunken Diamond will be the site. General practice
is to alternate between north and south, and the last playoff was at Bovard
between SC and Cal.
Looking over the roster of the Varsity, here are some interesting sta
tistics on the baseballers who will wear the Cardinal colors against the

Trojans. Jack Shepard, the versatile all - purpose
man and red-hot pro prospect, has been outstanding
in the fielding department. Shep has made 237 put
outs, committing only seven errors for a .974 average.
Dick "Yogi" Corzine, co-captaining catcher, has made
only three errors, has a .977 average, and made 117
PO's.
In. hitting, amazin' Chuck Essegian, the seiging
Armenian, leads in batting percentage (.362), in runs
(38), homeruns (10), and also strikeouts (18). War
ren Goodrich is next in batting with a .351. He's been
at the plate more than anybody (148) and has the
most hits (52). ,

In the vital "runs batted in" column, Shepard is tops with 37, followed
by lissegian (34) and Goodrich (23). Jack has hashed out the most two
buggers (7), and Dick Cole has connected six times for solid triples.
Over in the pitching department, steady and consistent Joe Chez, who
still likes to go to Paly for "goodies," is the top Indian performer. Joe
has yet to lose a game this season and has chalked up seven wins already.
He has an earned run figure of 2.51 and has struck out 24 and issued 40
free passes.
