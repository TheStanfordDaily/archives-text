# Math or Language--The New Choice
## 
### SUE GOODSTEIN Managing Editor, The Daily 
Don'l throw away your Frcnch
book, but an alternative to tho
lower division foreign language
requirement was set up by tho
Academic Council yesterday,
giving students a choice be
tween mathematics and foreign
languages.
Beginning this ; urn met*, lower di
vision student:', may replace the for
eign language requirement by com
pleting 15 units of analytic geom
etry and calculus beyond trigonom
etry.
The mathematics requirement
consists of a five-course three-unit
series through Math 23, or a three -

course five - unit series through
Math 4a.
Dean 11. Donald Winhigler, co
rhairman of the Lower Division
Committee which recommended
the new policy, explained that
this had the effect of extending to
all students an arrangement al
ready in effect for engineers.
(Last year the Council waived
the language requirements for en
gineers, allowing them a mathe
matics option.)
Although the option has be
come a general University policy,
Winhigler pointed out ,the actual
effect of the new ruling will de
pend on various departments' re
quirements.
Prof. Harold Bacon of the Math
ematics Department told The Daily
it was his guess that for the pres
ent there would not be a very large
number of students affected by the

new ruling.
Students in the School of Min

oral Sciences and in the Chemis
try Department will be among
those unable to use the option.
According to Charles F. Pa»k,
Dean of Mineral Sciences, and
Carl Lindquist, chemistry profes
sor, students in their respective
departments would still have to
meet both the foreign language
and mathematics requirements.
Prof. Edward Shaw of the Eco
nomics Department, however, said
that option of taking a foreign lan
guage or mathematics would be up
to the individual student in his de
partment. As far as the department
is concerned, lie pointed out, it
would be beneficial for students in
economics to study both fields —-
mathematics being a prerequisite
for several undergraduate courses,
and foreign languages required for
graduate work.

I A i educed forevjn language i«-
| quireinent of 18 units will al .o c<»
| into effort this summer. 'i he
Council ratified yesterday the m w
language requirement reconi
! mended hv the Lower Division
Committee last winter.
Under thi, system students will
be required to take only 13 units
of work in classic.-;, Germanic, or
Romanic languages, instead of the
present 21-unit requirement.
The reduction will be effected by
eliminating conversation and pro
nunciation courses from the pres
j ent language requirements.
The Academic Council took an
| other step toward ea ing the h>w
! cr division requirements yester
day by advocating examinations
I to determine whether
; could meet a requirement with

| nut tailing a courrr.
On ri lecomniendation from the
Lower Division Committee, the
Council took formal action in urg
! ing "chools and departments to ex
! tend the use of examinations for
tins purpose. Thus, if a student
demonstrated lie could meet the re
j quirement by his performance on
| the test, he would be excused from
taking the mure, although he
would receive no units of credit on
| (lie basis of the exam.
The Lower Division Committee,
brade 1 by Winbigler and Provost
Douglas Wbitakcr, submitted sev
eral other items which are not yet
prepared for action to the Coun
cil.
Among these are suggestions for
allowing lower division lequire
ments to be taken in the third and
fourth years, and for extending the
! independent study program.
