# Excom Against Paris of New Chappie Laws
## 
### 
ASSU Excom last night gave its
unofficial disapproval to several
provisions in a proposed revised
constitution for Hammer and Coffin
Society, publishers of the Chapar
ral.
Excom tabled the proposed re
vision four weeks ago, and last
night's discussion was intended as
a preliminary to later approval.
ASSU President Wayne Alley
pointed out that "the constitution
as it was submitted was unaccept
able" to the student officers and
University officials who had seen it.
A provision making a unanimous
vote necessary for admitting a new
member of the society was among
those the Excom frowned on. Bar
ney Gugel, Chappie secretary
treasurer, who presented the con
stitution, explained that complete
unanimity had been considered
necessary for efficient operation.
Arguments against the provision
included that the process would be
un s u i tab 1 e for an organization
whose work is considered an ASSU
publication.
A proposed three-member edito
rial board to rule on the good taste
of material to go in the Chappie
also went against the general con
sensus. Objections included that
editorial responsibility should be
sufficient without censorship, that
the board was self - perpetuating,
and that since hoard members could
not rule on their own work, one or
two persons could exercise control.
In this connection, Gugel pointed
out that only one editor in Chapar
ral history had been suspended be
cause of bad taste in the magazine.
