# DEMOCRATIC HOPEFUL
## Senator Russell Promises A Sound Administration 
### HADLEY ROFF Daily Political Editor 
Sen. Richard Russell from Georgia talked about peace, taxes,
and the constitution yesterday in San Francisco.
In a speech heavy with references to "this great and grand
country of ours," the "spirited American people," and the "Amer
ican way," the presidential hopeful promised sound administration.

* He pledged that if he won his way
i to the White House he would:
1. Balance the budget by 1954.
2. Reduce taxes.
!». Maintain a strong defense pro
gram.
"This I do promise the American
people," he said, "that 1 will preserve
gains made ovgr the past two dec
ades."
"But," he added, "I cannot prom
ise any new experiments in gov
ernment."
Proud of his southern heritage,
the Georgian said that he is a
"southern Democrat"' hut a "na
tional candidate" for the presi
dency.
He criticized the Truman adminis
tration, citing a "tendency toward
government regimentation." He par
ticularly hammered at Truman's
civil rights program.
He emphasized that FEPC "is not
j a racial or sectional question."
"It's a constitutional question," he
declared.
His rich drawl tense with con
viction, the Senator said the con
stitutional question boils down to
I whether "Congress can undertake to
legislate jail sentence on men opera
tinq farms and businesses, dictating
whom they are going to hire and
fire."
The Senator made constant ref
erence to the American way and a
return to "JefTersonian principles."
Such principles, according to
Russell, include sound economy
and a return to states' rights.
Present day inflation has led to
state socialism in other countries,
Russell warned. The senator, vet
eran of 20 years in the Senate and
known for his paring of appropria
tion bills, claims that by better
scrutiny of federal expenditures
savings can be made.
Of state-rights, lie said the states
created the federal government and
that the states should continue to
have every right "they ever had."
Currently serving as chairman of
the Senate's armed service commit
tee. Russell urged that military
procurement "not he cut by a
single tank." He asserted that
savings could be effected without
cutting the military budget.
He said he thought that the Korean

negotiations would have ended long
ago if "we were able to maintain air
superiority." He blamed irrespon
silbe budget cutting.
Striking a strong internationalist
note, Russell said that wc must con
tinue to help those nations that
"manifest a will to help themselves."
He qualified his remarks somewhat,
saying that over-all foreign expendi
tures can be reduced.
The Senator, who spoke a half
hour, skimmed only the high points
of his platform, he said, lie did not
explain how he would engineer the
tax reduction, while balancing the
budget and arming the world.
However, he said that "my experi
ence, my ability, my patriotism, and
my devotion to the Constitution"
would be valuable talents in the
White House.
