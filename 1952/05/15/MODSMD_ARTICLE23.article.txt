# WSB in the Steel Dispute
## 
### 
The Senate Banking Committee voted Tues
day to abolish the present Wage Stabilization
Board and replace it with an all-public panel
(no representatives of labor or management
stripped of any power to recommend wage dis
pute settlements.
The recommended panel's main job would
be to fix wage stabilization policies, but would
not consider issues involved in labor disputes.
It wouid go no further than advising as to how
stabilization policies would affect disputes.
We think the action is a step away from
what is needed. We would favor a stronger
arbitration machinery empowered io hand
down derisions, not a watering down of fun
ctions.
The Wage Stabilization Board by its very na
ture has an axe to grind. Perhaps there is merit
in the all-public panel recommendation. At any
rate we would favor a reshuffling of the mem
bership in the current Board so as to bring it
to a position more acceptable to both labor and
management.
The steel companies in the current dispute
are labeling the public members of the WSB
pro-labor. Had the board's decision gone
against labor, we have little doubt the CIO
would likewise challenge the board and accuse
it of pro-management sympathies.

The exact composition of an arbitration board
is a difficult problem. But whether all public
or partially public, its membership should be
acceptable in. advance to both parties in the
dispute. Under the WSB, neither party has a
choice in naming public members.
The Senate committee's action we consider
a retreat from the problem. We must endorse
fact-finding, compromise, and the offering of
solutions and decisions in labor-management
disputes.
Whether acceptance of the decisions should
be legally compulsory is another guestion.
Labor and management alike rebel at the word
compulsion. So do we. We would favor a vol
untary plan, but v/e would say arbitrate, offer
solutions. Give the board official stature, and
remove it from the criticism that it has an axe to
grind, that it is constituted with bias in one di-'
rection.
Such a board, commanding respect, handling
disputes freely offered to arbitration by both
parties, might mean an eguitable, peaceful solu
tion to the tangled labor disputes, which, like
a chain reaction, are spreading from industry
to industry.
Such a step would divert the public's clamor
for industrial pec.ce through a more drastic
and ler.s acceptable method â€” compulsory
arbitration.
