### PETE GROTHE 
Two notes on religion today, one humorous, the
other serious. The first concerns an evening service
that was being held in Arkansas recently.
The preacher was reading the lesson from Job and
as h ■ was at the passage that reads, "And yea, the
light of the wicked shall be put out." At that moment
the church was plunged into total darkness, and there
was startled uneasiness in the congregation. However,
the preacher was a quick-witted man, and ho said,
' In view of the unexpected fulfillment of this
prophecy, we will now spend a few minutes in silci t
prayer for the electric company."
Hi *Jc sjc
I walked into Memorial Church yesterday afternoon
and sat down in one of the pews. A moment later

an elderly man in jeans, most
likely a worker on the Farm,
shuffled down the aisle and sat
in the front row.
The little hair he had was
mussed, his clothes were dishev
i led, and his face mirrored weari
ness. He sat there motionless in
the sanctified stillness, his eyes
intently glued on the altar. After
about five minutes, he arose and
walked up the aisle.

His hair was still mussed, his clothes were stili
disheveled, but on his face shone a freshness that
he had not had five minutes before. He wore a look
of quiet confidence. His steps were no more slow and
shuffling. It was with a brisk stride that he left the
Memorial Church.
And it occurred to me at that moment that I had
never seen anyone walk out of a classroom with that
sjme look of inspiration. Very likely, be never got

past the eighth grade; and yet, he had something that
many of us don't have, an inner peace.
Many freshmen have had their religious convic
tions scrambled this year. They went into western
civ with a firm foundation of faith, and many are
going out with foundations that have already
crumbled. ,
This is only natural. We go to Sunday school while
kid.s, then go to church while in high school, and never
have our convictions tested. Then we go to college
and have some .sharp western civ instructors throw
searching questions at us, and we begin to wonder.
And this is as it should be. A religious conviction
isn't worth much unless it has been tested. However,
a good percentage of students enter Stanford sitting
on the religious fence. They are in a state of inde
cision about the church, and it doesn't take too much
to pur.suade them to turn one way or the other. Most
of this group comes out of civ agnostic.
They become agnostic because religion cannot be
put under a microscope like an amoeba can. The
existence of C«od can't be proven like the existence
(if sodium chloride can he proven. And therefore
many scientific minds pass it off. "It can't be proven,
so let us concern ourselves with things that we
know exist" is their attitude.
Reasoning has to come into play in a religious con
viction, and yet there is aiways a certain gap that
h;;s to he bridged by faith. And that faith can't be
taught fro.n a textbook. It has to come from within.
Some will say that faith doesn't exist and that it's a
lot of hogv.ash. Then, just tell them about a worker
who enters a church weary of foot and mind and who
goes out a new man.
One of the world's leading statesmen once said,
"Education and knowledge can show us what to do.
I', li; ion cjve.s us the incentive to do it."

the sanctified stillness, his eyes
intently glued on the altar. After
about five minutes, he arose and
walked up the aisle.

His hair was still mussed, his clothes were stili
disheveled, but on his face shone a freshness that
he had not had five minutes before. He wore a look
of quiet confidence. His steps were no more slow and
shuffling. It was with a brisk stride that he left the
Memorial Church.
And it occurred to me at that moment that I had
never seen anyone walk out of a classroom with that
sjme look of inspiration. Very likely, be never got

past the eighth grade; and yet, he had something that
many of us don't have, an inner peace.
Many freshmen have had their religious convic
tions scrambled this year. They went into western
civ with a firm foundation of faith, and many are
going out with foundations that have already
crumbled. ,
This is only natural. We go to Sunday school while
kid.s, then go to church while in high school, and never
have our convictions tested. Then we go to college
and have some .sharp western civ instructors throw
searching questions at us, and we begin to wonder.
And this is as it should be. A religious conviction
isn't worth much unless it has been tested. However,
a good percentage of students enter Stanford sitting
on the religious fence. They are in a state of inde
cision about the church, and it doesn't take too much
to pur.suade them to turn one way or the other. Most
of this group comes out of civ agnostic.
They become agnostic because religion cannot be
put under a microscope like an amoeba can. The
existence of C«od can't be proven like the existence
(if sodium chloride can he proven. And therefore
many scientific minds pass it off. "It can't be proven,
so let us concern ourselves with things that we
know exist" is their attitude.
Reasoning has to come into play in a religious con
viction, and yet there is aiways a certain gap that
h;;s to he bridged by faith. And that faith can't be
taught fro.n a textbook. It has to come from within.
Some will say that faith doesn't exist and that it's a
lot of hogv.ash. Then, just tell them about a worker
who enters a church weary of foot and mind and who
goes out a new man.

Two notes on religion today, one humorous, the

The preacher was reading the lesson from Job and

I walked into Memorial Church yesterday afternoon
and sat down in one of the pews. A moment later

an elderly man in jeans, most
likely a worker on the Farm,
shuffled down the aisle and sat
in the front row.

mussed, his clothes were dishev

the sanctified stillness, his eyes
