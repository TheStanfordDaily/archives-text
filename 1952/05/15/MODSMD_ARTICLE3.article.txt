### 
WASHINGTON, May 14 (UP) â€”
Striking oil workers tonight "re
luctantly" accepted a government
ceiling of 15 cents an hour on wage
boosts and federal officials predicted
1 tic nationwide oil strike will soon
be over.
It may be Pevcral days, however,
before contracts can be signed with
oil companies in plant-by-plant ne
gotiations all over the nation.
The break in the 15 - day - old
strike that has cut military flying
and threatened limited gasoline ra
tioning came a few hours after the
Wage Stabilization Board clamped
tlie 15-cent ceiling on wage in
creases today.
An oil industry spokesman in
Denver said his company already
has offered a 15-cent hourly in
crease and it. appears now that the
strike may end in a day or two.
He said many of the strikers are
tired of being off the job. "Our
thinking would be that the men
would come back," he added.
