Crew Financing
The recent clarification of the crew's position with the Athletic Depart
ment leaves the Card oarsmen with but one source ol continued support:
alumni and friends.
For the past several years the crewmen in charge of financing have
worked constantly with the University General Secretary's office, which
has aided them in preparing letters and developing a list of prospective
contributors.
The University has even arranged that checks can be made payable to
Stanford University for the Crew Association, thus rendering crew con
tributions tax deductable.
This year, however, the crew has not yet received sufficient assistance
lo insure a full racing season, including a trip to the National Intercollegiate
Regatta and to the Olympic Trials.
About $8,000 is necessary and not quite $2,000 has been donated.
Since this year's crew is undoubtedly the most powerful yet developed at
Stanford, it will be a particular disappointment if they can not try for
the trip to Helsinki.
Captain Ken Lewis and others of the Crew Association have discussed
the possibility of student soliciting. The University has only one objection:
it wants no circus-style drive such as the oarsmen carried on two years ago.
Therefore, we suggest that the crew approach the campus by n ail in
the same mature way it has approached alumni and other friends. And to
the campus: if the crew does ask for contributions, support it. The Card
roWers have, are, and will continue to bring to Stanford fame and glory.
(Jive the crew a sporting chance.
Methods in drew
Great competitive spirit and well-coordinated oarsmen are being pro
duced in the crew with a slightly unorthodox method of coaching used
by coach Bob White.
Instead of picking a first boating, second boating, etc., working them out
against each other, and moving men up or down according to the ability
they display, White has more or less evened things off.
By putting a third of the potential first stringers in each ol' three boat
ings and filling them out as evenly as possible, White has the guys racing
to beat hell in the pre-dawn workouts.
The lineups stick and the results have paid off. In the preliminary
races with UCLA, USC and Oregon State, whichever boat won the
weekly time trials maintained Stanford's undefeated record handily on
the weekend.
Granted the Bruins, Trojans, and Beavers are third-rate crews. Never
theless the Cards have yet to be really extended in winning. And steady
improvement in times was topped by a 15 minute fiat three-mile trial Mon
day. Look out, Cal.
Quotable Quotes
Al Masters: ''If the PCC college presidents would get together and
agree to lire outright any school ollicial found acting in violation of the
conference athlete code, they would heavily increase its Success."
Tennis Coach Bob Renker: "Check the records a bit, and you'll prob
ably find that Stanford sports in gneral have been on a steady upgrade
since the close of the war." We checked; they seem to have.
Around the Campus
Don't miss Block and Circle S Water Carnival today, either in the after
noon or evening. The lettermen societies have really lined up an all
around extravaganza, well worth the 60c price of admission.
Chuck Essegian's ten home runs so far this season are more than any
Stanford ballplayer has even before hit in an entire three-year career.
Junior Dan Elliott and Frosh Paul Merrill may join the parade of Cards
to Helsinki. Merrill has been named a qualifier and Elliott and alternate
for the United States final eliminations to select a skipper for the Monotype
or Finn Class sailboats in Olympic racing.
