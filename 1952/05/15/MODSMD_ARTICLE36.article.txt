## ... And in The Majors 
### 
With one-sixth of the seaon in
the books, the major league race is
.shaping up just about the way it
was expected to, at least a sfar as
league lea . ers are concerned.
Cleveland has regained top spot
in the American loop thanks to a
top pitching staff and the hitting of
Al Rosen, who leads in runs batted
j in, homers with eight, and has a
stick mark of .327.
With a two-game lead over run
j ners-up Washington and Boston, the
I Indi :ris are coming along as
I predicted. St. Louis is fading and
[ currently 5V:> games off the pace.
The New York entry is an
chored in the second divi ion and
it has not been since 1025 that a
Yank club has floundered for so
long in such an undesired spot.
Rookie help h is not come through
and it looks like this season will
be one of seasoning and experi
ence. Hut watch the Yanks next
year, the year after that, and the
ye::r after that.
Washington is still afire and
show.; no signs of dying out. It was
said that the Senators had too many
lettermen back from last year's sev
enth-place club to do much better.
But veterans Floyd Baker, Pete
Runnels, and Clyde Kluttz are all
clubbing over .300 and the addition
of Jackie Jen en and Archie Wil
son from the Yanks and Jim Busby
of the White Sox has bolstered the
club. Pitching will likely prove the
collapse of the Capital City nine.
In the National League the race is
narrowing to the Giants and Dodg
ers, with Chicago and Cincinnati
still within call. There is not much
question that it will be another
tight September race with Brook
lyn and New York the only con
tenders for the (lag.
Chicago and Cincinnati have al
ready done better than anyone
expected. The big disappointment
in the senior circuit is Pittsburgh.
Branch Rickey, new owner of the
Pirates, has gone all out to get a
pennant winner. Rut this isn't the
year. II:s newly acquired rookies
have not panned out and the Pi
rates are secured in the basement
with five wins and 21 losses, and
13' > games off the pace.
In top action this week, the
Giants take on Chicago and Cincin
nati while Brooklyn should better
ts position against Pittsburgh. In
the American, Washington is at De
troit, Boston at Chicago, and New
York tries to come back against
Cleveland.

said that the Senators had too many
lettermen back from last year's sev
enth-place club to do much better.
But veterans Floyd Baker, Pete
Runnels, and Clyde Kluttz are all
clubbing over .300 and the addition
of Jackie Jen en and Archie Wil
son from the Yanks and Jim Busby
of the White Sox has bolstered the
club. Pitching will likely prove the
collapse of the Capital City nine.
In the National League the race is
narrowing to the Giants and Dodg
ers, with Chicago and Cincinnati
still within call. There is not much
question that it will be another
tight September race with Brook
lyn and New York the only con
tenders for the (lag.
Chicago and Cincinnati have al
ready done better than anyone
expected. The big disappointment
in the senior circuit is Pittsburgh.
Branch Rickey, new owner of the
Pirates, has gone all out to get a
pennant winner. Rut this isn't the
year. II:s newly acquired rookies
have not panned out and the Pi
rates are secured in the basement
with five wins and 21 losses, and
13' > games off the pace.
In top action this week, the
Giants take on Chicago and Cincin
nati while Brooklyn should better
ts position against Pittsburgh. In
the American, Washington is at De
troit, Boston at Chicago, and New
York tries to come back against
Cleveland.
With one-sixth of the seaon in
the books, the major league race is
.shaping up just about the way it
was expected to, at least a sfar as
league lea . ers are concerned.
Cleveland has regained top spot
in the American loop thanks to a
top pitching staff and the hitting of
Al Rosen, who leads in runs batted
j in, homers with eight, and has a
stick mark of .327.
With a two-game lead over run
j ners-up Washington and Boston, the
I Indi :ris are coming along as
I predicted. St. Louis is fading and
[ currently 5V:> games off the pace.
The New York entry is an
chored in the second divi ion and
it has not been since 1025 that a
Yank club has floundered for so
long in such an undesired spot.
Rookie help h is not come through
and it looks like this season will
be one of seasoning and experi
ence. Hut watch the Yanks next
year, the year after that, and the
ye::r after that.
Washington is still afire and
show.; no signs of dying out. It was
