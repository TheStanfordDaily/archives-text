# Mathias Heads for Hawaiian Relays
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
Early this evening, Bob Mathias,
Stanford's man of many talents, will
leave via airplane for the isle of en
chantment, Hawaii, to participate in
the annual Rainbow Relyas to be
held this Saturday.
Bob, the only participant from the
mainland, will compete against the
top Island athletes from the Uni
versity of Hawaii and the top Ha
waiian high school stars.
Although there will be many top
athletes represented, the 'competi
tion probably won't be up to that
faced by the versatile giant in re
cent outings, and there is a possi
bility of his taking five or six firsts
as well as setting several island
records.
He will enter both hurdles, the
shot put, discus, javelin, and pos
sibly the high jump as the island
ers get their first look at the one
man track team.
While Mathias preps for his
weekend show, Coach Jack YVeiers
haucer is busy juggling his team for
Saturday night's Modesto Relays,
His big job will be to fill the gaps
made by the absence of Big Bob.
Bob's points in the high hurdles and

discus will be irreplaceable, and the
440 and 880 relay teams will have
to be juggled about.
Maury Parsons will probably
move up to the anchor position
while Pete McKay, Stanford's top
broad jumper, will most likely take
over in his previous place. The loss
of Mathias's great speed will be
sorely felt here, .too.
The loss of possible points in
these four events might easily cost
Stanford a place or two in final
standings. In last week's Fresno
Relays, Stanford finished but eight
points better than UCLA in the
college class, and behind UCLA in
the open class with Cal close be
hind.
