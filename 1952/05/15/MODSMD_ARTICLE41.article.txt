# Brave Hurls One-Hitter
## 
### 
Only an infield dribbler to second
base stood between Ray Highsmith
and the Hall of Fame yesterday as
the Braves blanked Sequoia High
5 to 0 on the frosh diamond.
That infield hit by the Cherokees'
A 1 Curruti in the third inning was
the only base knock oft the speed
balling southpaw.
Ray really had the Sequoia
batters on his hip; there were
only two u'illicult chances that the
Braves had to field; a dribbler
in front of the plate with the
bases loaded in the fifth and a
fine running catch bv Gordy Gal
loway in the sixth.
Ray struck out three and walked
six in six brilliant innings of work.
Another southpaw, Stan Fetterman,
pitched the last inning and didn't
allow a ball out of the infield.
The Braves made one run in the
first on Bob Burdick's single. Hits
by Gordy Galloway, Clarke Nelson,
and Ben Swan added another in the
fourth. Two more came in the fifth
on the first of Sid Hall's doubles
and an infield out. Pete Reynolds

arid Hall hit two baggers for the Inst
run in the sixth.
