# Ruffles Oust Roughs From Branner Hall
## 
### CAROLYN MARTIN 
Branner has led a double life.
Today 185 freshmen, sopho
mores, and transfers live here.
But until seven or eight years
ago John Branner Hall was the

home of the same number of
Stanford roughs. This means
more than one proud father has
returned to find ruffled curtains
at the windows and bulletin
boards on the walls of "good
ole 106."
Abide from this Branner hasn't
changed much. Situated next door
to Toyon, it is a U-.shaped building
with a lawn in front. Since Encina,
Stern, and Crothcrs are only a few
steps away, four men's residences
can call Branner without spending
a dime.
Sometimes these Stanford males
wander over, not to buzz any par
ticular number, but to enjoy the
atmosphere and sit in the crimson
curtained lobby playing cards, the
radio-phonograph, or the piano.
In the dorm basement arc Bcn
dixes and clotheslines, and upstairs
are a separate washing and ironing
room and facilities for sending out
dry cleaning. Branner has two
large balcony sun porches and a
canoe; they share a volleyball court
with Toyon.
Branner is especially proud of its
scholarship fund. Each year by
giving food sales, a style show, and
a miniature carnival in the lobby,
enough money is raised to furnii.il
room, board, and tuition for a cho
sen Brannerite.


SUNBATHERSâ€”The 185 freshmen and sophomore women living
in Branner Hall spend many spring hours sunning on the
hall's two sunporches. Branner was converted several years
ago from a men s dormitory, still features free phone service to
men's halls.
