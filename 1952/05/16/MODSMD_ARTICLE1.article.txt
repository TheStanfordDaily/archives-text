NliW YORK. May 11 (UP) The
president of tlie Liberty Broadcast
ing System announced .suspension
of operation of the 1J65-station net
work tonight to protest an "illegal
monopoly" in baseball broadcast
ing.
Gordon McLendon said Liberty's
suspension at 11:45 p.m., EDT, was
leaving station.; affiliated with the
ty:;tem to operate independently.
He accused major league baseball
of dictating where and what station
could broadcast games and refusing
to permit competing broadcasts.
' I charge that organized baseball
violates tiie Bill of Rights, free
tpeceh, the anti-trust laws, and is
at war with free enterprise," Mc-
Lendon said.
He said the restrictions by "dicta
tors of baseball" had nothing to do
with fear of losing gate receipts but
were imposed because they arc
"afraid they will lose their mo
nopoly. "
