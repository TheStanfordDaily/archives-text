# Ram's Head's 'Rainbow' Is 'Pot of Gold' Fantasy
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
Fantasy by species and Irish by genus, "Finian's Rainbow" ap
proached Broadway a few seasons back with all the earmarks of
the usual, tiresome, overworked whimsy. But E. Y. Harburgh, col
laborating with Burton Lane on the score and Fred Saidy on the
story, used an ounce of wisdom and came up with a pot of gold.

Eleven delightful songs and a
curiously successful hodge-podge of
fantasy and social satire kept cus
tomers happy through 582 perform

The Ram's Head version of "Fin

Memorial Auditorium last evening,

will Rive only two more perform
ances. But for once in the recent
history of the organization, the
short run need not he looked upon
aj a merciful blessing.
Plagued by casting trouble and
other difficulties from the start,
Ram's Head has presented a pro
duction which, by and large, docs
justice to a fine musical comedy.
Interestingly, it is the support
ing players who conic to the
foreground and quite steal the
show from the stars. Pat Currier,
to he sure, is fine, if a little weak
voiced, as Sharon, and Bert Burns
lumbers his way through Woody
with what is apparently consid
ered the proper charm for a lead
ing man. Together, they are no
tably £ood on the show's best
song, "Old Devil Moon." Still, the
supporting east is responsible for
most of the brightest moments.
As Og, the leprechaun turning
mortal, George Denny has i t last
found his part, and this one teems
almost written to his special style.
And as Susan, the silent girl who
talks with her feet. Jane Bowcn
dances with amazing sparkle.
From the comparative obscurity
of the dancing ensemble, Judy
Dickenson projects herself witli
enormous verve and scores a per
sonal triumph. Again, Curt Ilun
gerford, Dick Davis, and Ted
•Munch (as the Passion Pilgrim
Gospclers), together with Senator
Billboard Rawkins (well played by
Hal Burdick Jr.), give "The Begat"
a really smart once-over.
Taken as a whole, "Finian's Rain
bow" asks onlv for some tightening
up and a faster pace between num
bers. Otherwise, it. is a handsome
and enjoyable production.
