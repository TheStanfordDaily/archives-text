# New Policy OK'd For Advertising
## 
### 
ASSU Excom on Wednesday
night altered the constitution to
put most campus advertising
displays under the supervision
of the Public Relations Diiector.
The new rules specify that any
one putting up posters on Quad or
on most bulletin boards must fill
out an agreement to take the ma
terial down right after the event.
Only exceptions are:
University bulletin boards, con
trolled by Public Exercises; depart
ment boards, supervised by depart
ment secretaries; the banner in
front of Union, controlled by Car
dinals; and living group bulletin
boards, taken care of by the groups
themselves.
The new rules also specify that
posters cannot b£ larger than 14 by
20 inches without Excom approval,
that nothing can be posted in Inner
Quad, and that no nails or paint
may be used.
Excom also approved Foreign
Scholarship Commit Ice by - laws
and changes in the Institute of
International Relations by - laws.
These set down the delineation
between the two organizations—
pointing out that the Foreign
Scholarship Committee's function
is limited to administration of the
ASSU Forc ; ,~n Scholarship pro
gram and that the committee is
not under lIR control. However,
the by-laws now state that the
lIR f-hall initiate co-operation
with the committee and shall be
able to make recommendations.
John Marshall of the lIR and
Camilla Christie of the Concert Sc
ries reported that the two organiza
tions are co-operating closely on
plans for an III"! benefit concert for
next year. The lIR will take finan
cial responsibility and handle pub
licity, while the Series will do the
administrative work and l>ookkeep
ing. The groups agree that a popu
lar (as opposed to classical) artist
should be featured and that the
concert should be held in winter
quarter.
Excom also approved a sweater
as a fourth - year gymnastics
award to Hob White: a first-year
polo award to Doug Allen; and
second-year polo awards to Ale
jandro Echavarria, Allen Scherer,
and Karl Walton.

Officials of the Stanford Library
believe that discipline to make
study in living groups possible is
preferable to lengthening library
hours during Dead Week, according
to a letter which ASSU President
Wayne Alley read to Excom Wed
nesday night.
The officials feci that a request
for extra library hours would re
flect a lack of student responsibility
in maintaining quiet in their resi

Officials of the Stanford Library
believe that discipline to make
study in living groups possible is
preferable to lengthening library
hours during Dead Week, according
to a letter which ASSU President
Wayne Alley read to Excom Wed
nesday night.
The officials feci that a request
for extra library hours would re
flect a lack of student responsibility
in maintaining quiet in their resi
dences.
ASSU Excom on Wednesday
night altered the constitution to
put most campus advertising
displays under the supervision
of the Public Relations Diiector.
The new rules specify that any
one putting up posters on Quad or
on most bulletin boards must fill
out an agreement to take the ma
terial down right after the event.
Only exceptions are:
University bulletin boards, con
trolled by Public Exercises; depart
ment boards, supervised by depart
ment secretaries; the banner in
front of Union, controlled by Car
dinals; and living group bulletin
boards, taken care of by the groups
themselves.
The new rules also specify that
posters cannot b£ larger than 14 by
20 inches without Excom approval,
that nothing can be posted in Inner
Quad, and that no nails or paint
may be used.
Excom also approved Foreign
Scholarship Commit Ice by - laws
and changes in the Institute of
International Relations by - laws.
These set down the delineation
between the two organizations—
pointing out that the Foreign
Scholarship Committee's function
is limited to administration of the
ASSU Forc ; ,~n Scholarship pro
gram and that the committee is
not under lIR control. However,
the by-laws now state that the
lIR f-hall initiate co-operation
with the committee and shall be
able to make recommendations.
John Marshall of the lIR and
Camilla Christie of the Concert Sc
ries reported that the two organiza
tions are co-operating closely on
plans for an III"! benefit concert for
next year. The lIR will take finan
cial responsibility and handle pub
licity, while the Series will do the
administrative work and l>ookkeep
ing. The groups agree that a popu
lar (as opposed to classical) artist
should be featured and that the
