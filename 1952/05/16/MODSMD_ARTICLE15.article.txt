# Card Nine Battles SC In Southland
## CIBA Flag Hangs On Twin Victory 
### DICK KLEIN Daily Sports Editor 
Coach Everett Dean and his
hustling Indian diamond stars
battle the USC Trojans in their
southland lair today for the
rights to the CIBA pennant. A
sweep by either team in the two
game series set for SC's Bovard
Field today and tomorrow means
the bunting.
The CIBA champ nets the trip to
the Northwest to play in the Pacific
Coast, championships awl then
eventually the NCAA play-ofTs. But
both coaches arc looking no further
than today's game and have their
top pitchers ready to go on im
mediate call. Botli teams boast a 9-5
record.
The Stanford team flew down to
Los Angeles yesterday afternoon and
went through a scheduled workout
at Bovard from 5 p.m. to dinner time.
Until the last minute, the baseballcrs
were set to leave this morning on
an early plane with the tennis squad.
But Coach Dean figured that he
would not risk any air-sick mis
haps. especially since fireballer Rog
Osenbaugh is the most susceptible.
While in the Southland for the
gigantic two-day set-to, the team
will make its headquarters at the
commodious Hollywood Knicker
bocker Hotel. The team will return
Sunday.
Only question mark on the top
drawer hatting order is Warren
Goodrich, flashy- soph shortstop.
Goodrich is nursing a swollen
ankle which the team physicians
have classified as "not serious."
If Goodrich fails to make tlx
grade, Co-captain Artie Abrahamson
will move over to shortstop and frosh
Rich Scramaglia will take over the
second sack. The batting order will
remain the same as last week.
The Trojans arc figured to start ofT
with ace Tom Lovrich, who has a
neat 10-1 record for the season.
Their plans call for Lovrich to get
them to an important one-game
bulge and tp insure them of at least
a tic. Either Jack Schlarb or Dave
Cesca will be on the hill in tomor
row's contest.
Coach Dean will open up with
fasl-hallcr Rog Osenbaugh, the
league's top strikeout man. Rog.
who battled a bad leg for most of
the season, is in top form and, if
right, could he mighty stingy with
the hasehits, even for the classy
Troy-boys. â€¢
The guy who never loses, Joe Chez,
will be saved for the season finale.
Joe has a 7-0 record for the season
and a 4-0 posting for regular CIBA
fame. Already this season, Chez sent
the Southern Cal blasters away with
only oiie hit and a neat shutout up
here on the Farm.
The two Clrarnofsky brothers, Hal
and Stan, who form a very good
double-play combo, arc the top hit
ters on SC squad. Both arc batting
well above the .350 mark.
For the Indians, Chuck Essegian
and Jack Shcperd present all the
fireworks at the platter. Charlie,
the sieging Armenian, is the top
hoincrun producer in the league
and needs only one more to break
the lop record. Shcp, who has
played a lot of positions for Dean,
is anchored at first base now and
tops the Cards in RBl's.
While both teams will be gunning
for a sweep and thus the title, plans
have already been made for a tie.
In case of the very possible split, a
sudden-death single game will be
played on the Sunken Diamond next
weekend.
