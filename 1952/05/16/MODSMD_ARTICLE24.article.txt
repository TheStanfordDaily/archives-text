# Two Oil Settlements Return 3,400 To Jobs
## Pipeline Strike Imperils Denver 
### 
DENVER, May 15 (UP)- Two
i settlements involving about
: 3,400 workers were reached with
striking oil unions tonight as a
large share of Denver's gasoline
supply was threatened by a
pipeline strike scheduled for
midnight (MST).
In the biggest break of the 16-
day-old walkout, the central states
petroleum union at Sugar Creek,
Mo., announced settlement with
Standard Oil Co. providing for a 15-
cent hourly increase plus nine cent .
retroactive May 1, 1952, to Dec. 1,
1951.
The other settlement also provided
for a 15-cent increase involving some
400 CIO oil workers at the (Ilobr
Refining Co. at. Lemont, 111. Both
settlements followed the WaSta
bilization Board's action limiting the
wage increase to 15 cents.
At the same time, thr CIO od
workers announced they intended t'i
strike at midnight against Iho Wyci
Pipeline Co. of Casper, Wyo., which
supplies about half of Denver's gaso
line supply.
Although only about ill employee, r ;
would be ofT the job on the WycÂ»
pipeline, it:; shutdown was expected
j to slash deeply into gas consumption
|in the Denver area. Supervisory
J employees were to man the struct:
pipeline, but a union spokesman said
he doubted "very much" if they
could keep any amount of gas flow
ing into Denver.
Earlier today, O. A. Knight elan
lied an earlier statement regarding
the strike by announcing that st.fik
int; workers "are not expected to re
turn to work until they have agree
ments giving them the full amount
of wage increases approved by th 1 12
Wage Stabilization Board yesterday."'
