# Welcome News—A Sponsor Weekend
## 
### 
The kind of adjustment a freshman girl makes
to Stanford can depend largely on one person:
her sponsor. This person, who is at least for
awhile semi-divine, must be able to answer
questions ranging from "How should I study for
Civ?" to "What does it mean to get pinned?"
It is because sponsoring is so important that
we welcome the news that the Associated Wo
men Students are holding a Sponsor Weekend
again this year.
A weekend of indoctrination for sponsors
was held last year for the first time after it was
decided that an orientation prpogram in the
rush of pre-reg was not enough—that sponsors
needed more detailed information about Stan
ford as a whole. The 1951- 52 sponsors say it
was a "helpful and enriching experience."

Today through Sunday the newly appointed
sponsors—who will freely donate hours to help
ing the freshmen next fall —will give an addi
tional weekend of their time to learning about
Stanford. Expenses for the weekend will be
paid by the University —with the exception of
a small housing charge.
The program will include talks by University
officials, living groups directors, and student
leaders. Such topics will be covered as "The
Public Looks at Stanford." "The Director and
the Sponsor," and "Student Government."
All in all, the weekend sounds like one well
planned to make Stanford's highly successful
sponsoring program even better.
