# BULL SESSION
## 
### DICK McLEAN 
You Are There . . .
What would you do if a bright sun and a deadline
for a bull session came due on the same day? You
might call up the editor arid say that you've got a
bad cold or you could be a martyr and "suffer for the
sake of your art."
But if you're a practical idealist—caring not only
for life but the living of it as well—you'd write a
b ill session from the beach.
And that's just what I'm doing right now. I'm
lying in the hot sun orifthe beach at Rio Del Mar
writing in an old notebook with Stanford and stud
ies fifty miles away. It's really great. At this mo
ment I don't care about the midterm for Monday or
anything. In fact, if I were approached properly,
I'd quit college and join the beach combers union
right now.

When I think about all the diffi
cult things you people are doing
this minute, my heart goes out to
you. You're heading for a two
o'clock class or dragging your
sun drenched bodies into the li
brary. Should I get tired of writ
ing, 1 can put my head down and
nap for a while. (I wish all writ
ing were this painless.)
You know, it's funny how
sounds become so much clearer

wlu n you close your eyes. Compensation I guess.
But anyway, when my eyes are closed I can hear the
people down the beach playing volley ball, the slap
<•[ the waves as they plunk up on the beach and
then slosh back. Also I can hear the indignant scream
ot beer cans being stabbed. Oh it's a great day. I
wi_h you were all here.
Oh-o-o! I just got baby oil rubbed on my back.
(This fact bears no relationship to anything else but
1 thought I'd just mention it in passing.)
I'm wearing a pair of sun glasses so that the glare
of the white page won't blind me. Funny, everything

looks different through sun glasses. All the people
look browner and the colors brighter. The hills down
the bay are yellow-green and the sky beyond is bluer.
But if I take off the blasses the colors are washed
out and blurred by the sun. So I keep them on.
It's the same way with viewpoint. If I sat down
and examine all the things I should be doing in the
sunlight of reality, this day wouldn't be half so
warm or fun. The only answer seems to be: "Tem
per reality with the sunglasses of laziness."
Damned if I can figure how the philosophy got in
here. I'm probably just out searching for a rationali
zation for cutting school. But, it's too fine a day to
get cluttered up wiLh thinking. It's probably early
morning as you people read this so I won't burden
your sleepy minds either. It's agreed then? We'll
knock off this philosophy stuff.
The only decision facing me now is whether or not
to go swimming. The salt water would be bracing and
cooling, true. But I don't know if I want to be in
vigorated. I like things the way they are now. Kind
of sleepy and numb and dull. Of course, if I lie here
much longer, my hide will burn off. I'm afraid the
only answer is to seek a bit of cooling refreshment
and see if I can get a little more baby oil rubbed on
my back. But yet again, maybe I should go swimming.
I guess the volley ball game down the beach is
over. At least, when 1 had my head down, I couldn't
hear them anymore. The only sound was that of
the swishing waves and that other happy sound—
the sharp opener crunching through the fragile tin
followed by the eager hiss that mellows into a lisp
ing murmur.
There's a little breeze blowing now. It's nice though.
I can feel the temperature on my back grow higher
and higher and then a small gust comes along and
blows the smoke away. It sure is a great day. No
bells ringing, no hurrying, no thoughts of midterms
tomorrow, or papers due. (Oh-o-o! Just got baby oil
rubbed on my back again.) No worries at all. It sufe
is a great, day. I wonder if I should go swimming? I
think I'll close my eyes and worry about it for a
while.

of the white page won't blind me. Funny, everything

looks different through sun glasses. All the people
look browner and the colors brighter. The hills down
the bay are yellow-green and the sky beyond is bluer.
But if I take off the blasses the colors are washed
out and blurred by the sun. So I keep them on.
It's the same way with viewpoint. If I sat down
and examine all the things I should be doing in the
sunlight of reality, this day wouldn't be half so
warm or fun. The only answer seems to be: "Tem
per reality with the sunglasses of laziness."
Damned if I can figure how the philosophy got in
here. I'm probably just out searching for a rationali
zation for cutting school. But, it's too fine a day to
get cluttered up wiLh thinking. It's probably early
morning as you people read this so I won't burden
your sleepy minds either. It's agreed then? We'll
knock off this philosophy stuff.
The only decision facing me now is whether or not
to go swimming. The salt water would be bracing and
cooling, true. But I don't know if I want to be in
vigorated. I like things the way they are now. Kind
of sleepy and numb and dull. Of course, if I lie here
much longer, my hide will burn off. I'm afraid the
only answer is to seek a bit of cooling refreshment
and see if I can get a little more baby oil rubbed on
my back. But yet again, maybe I should go swimming.
I guess the volley ball game down the beach is
over. At least, when 1 had my head down, I couldn't
hear them anymore. The only sound was that of
the swishing waves and that other happy sound—
the sharp opener crunching through the fragile tin
followed by the eager hiss that mellows into a lisp
ing murmur.
There's a little breeze blowing now. It's nice though.
I can feel the temperature on my back grow higher
and higher and then a small gust comes along and
blows the smoke away. It sure is a great day. No
bells ringing, no hurrying, no thoughts of midterms
tomorrow, or papers due. (Oh-o-o! Just got baby oil
rubbed on my back again.) No worries at all. It sufe
is a great, day. I wonder if I should go swimming? I
think I'll close my eyes and worry about it for a
while.

You Are There . . .
What would you do if a bright sun and a deadline
for a bull session came due on the same day? You
might call up the editor arid say that you've got a
bad cold or you could be a martyr and "suffer for the
sake of your art."
But if you're a practical idealist—caring not only
for life but the living of it as well—you'd write a
b ill session from the beach.
And that's just what I'm doing right now. I'm
lying in the hot sun orifthe beach at Rio Del Mar
writing in an old notebook with Stanford and stud
ies fifty miles away. It's really great. At this mo
ment I don't care about the midterm for Monday or
anything. In fact, if I were approached properly,
I'd quit college and join the beach combers union
right now.

When I think about all the diffi
cult things you people are doing
this minute, my heart goes out to
you. You're heading for a two
o'clock class or dragging your
sun drenched bodies into the li
brary. Should I get tired of writ
ing, 1 can put my head down and
nap for a while. (I wish all writ
ing were this painless.)
You know, it's funny how
sounds become so much clearer

wlu n you close your eyes. Compensation I guess.
But anyway, when my eyes are closed I can hear the
people down the beach playing volley ball, the slap
<•[ the waves as they plunk up on the beach and
then slosh back. Also I can hear the indignant scream
ot beer cans being stabbed. Oh it's a great day. I
wi_h you were all here.
Oh-o-o! I just got baby oil rubbed on my back.

There's a little breeze blowing now. It's nice though.
I can feel the temperature on my back grow higher
and higher and then a small gust comes along and
blows the smoke away. It sure is a great day. No
bells ringing, no hurrying, no thoughts of midterms
tomorrow, or papers due. (Oh-o-o! Just got baby oil
rubbed on my back again.) No worries at all. It sufe
is a great, day. I wonder if I should go swimming? I
think I'll close my eyes and worry about it for a
while.

You Are There . . .
What would you do if a bright sun and a deadline
for a bull session came due on the same day? You
might call up the editor arid say that you've got a
bad cold or you could be a martyr and "suffer for the
sake of your art."
But if you're a practical idealist—caring not only
for life but the living of it as well—you'd write a
b ill session from the beach.
And that's just what I'm doing right now. I'm
lying in the hot sun orifthe beach at Rio Del Mar
writing in an old notebook with Stanford and stud
ies fifty miles away. It's really great. At this mo
ment I don't care about the midterm for Monday or
anything. In fact, if I were approached properly,
I'd quit college and join the beach combers union
right now.

When I think about all the diffi
cult things you people are doing
this minute, my heart goes out to
you. You're heading for a two
o'clock class or dragging your
sun drenched bodies into the li
brary. Should I get tired of writ
ing, 1 can put my head down and
nap for a while. (I wish all writ
ing were this painless.)
You know, it's funny how
sounds become so much clearer

wlu n you close your eyes. Compensation I guess.
But anyway, when my eyes are closed I can hear the
people down the beach playing volley ball, the slap
<•[ the waves as they plunk up on the beach and
then slosh back. Also I can hear the indignant scream
ot beer cans being stabbed. Oh it's a great day. I
wi_h you were all here.
Oh-o-o! I just got baby oil rubbed on my back.
(This fact bears no relationship to anything else but
1 thought I'd just mention it in passing.)
I'm wearing a pair of sun glasses so that the glare
of the white page won't blind me. Funny, everything

looks different through sun glasses. All the people
look browner and the colors brighter. The hills down
the bay are yellow-green and the sky beyond is bluer.
But if I take off the blasses the colors are washed
out and blurred by the sun. So I keep them on.
It's the same way with viewpoint. If I sat down
and examine all the things I should be doing in the
sunlight of reality, this day wouldn't be half so
warm or fun. The only answer seems to be: "Tem
per reality with the sunglasses of laziness."
Damned if I can figure how the philosophy got in
here. I'm probably just out searching for a rationali
zation for cutting school. But, it's too fine a day to
get cluttered up wiLh thinking. It's probably early
morning as you people read this so I won't burden
your sleepy minds either. It's agreed then? We'll
knock off this philosophy stuff.
The only decision facing me now is whether or not
to go swimming. The salt water would be bracing and
cooling, true. But I don't know if I want to be in
vigorated. I like things the way they are now. Kind
of sleepy and numb and dull. Of course, if I lie here
much longer, my hide will burn off. I'm afraid the
only answer is to seek a bit of cooling refreshment
and see if I can get a little more baby oil rubbed on
my back. But yet again, maybe I should go swimming.
I guess the volley ball game down the beach is
over. At least, when 1 had my head down, I couldn't
hear them anymore. The only sound was that of
the swishing waves and that other happy sound—
the sharp opener crunching through the fragile tin
followed by the eager hiss that mellows into a lisp
ing murmur.
There's a little breeze blowing now. It's nice though.
I can feel the temperature on my back grow higher
and higher and then a small gust comes along and
blows the smoke away. It sure is a great day. No
bells ringing, no hurrying, no thoughts of midterms
tomorrow, or papers due. (Oh-o-o! Just got baby oil
rubbed on my back again.) No worries at all. It sufe
is a great, day. I wonder if I should go swimming? I
think I'll close my eyes and worry about it for a
while.
