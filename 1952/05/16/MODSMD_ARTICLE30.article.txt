# CAMPUS OPINION
## Bull Session No Place for Religion 
### 
Pete Grothe, writing in the Dull Session of May 15,
was concerned with a very serious and deep subject,
one which 1 feel has no place in such a column. If
humor or sports writers persist in discussing such
topics, however, I think that the Daily should make
it their policy to require in such articles certain stand
ards of adequacy so as not to leave the reader with
that all-too-familiar feeling of ineompletion on the
part of the author in establishing his premise and
: ulisfactorily defending his point. Let us critically
< xainine Pete's argument in favor of faith:
1 He informs us that Western Civ tests our beliefs
and that this is good. Agreed!
2. He also tells us that many students enter Stanford
undecided about religion and that most of them come
out of Civ as agnostics because the existence of God
cannot be scientifically proven. How about some
statistical evidence to back up this bold statement, or
are we to accept it on "faith."
3. Mr. Grothe observed a man in jeans enter the
church, sit there for five minutes, and walk out brisk
ly, his face shining with new freshness; the observer
Vv\> impressed with what he assumed to be a look of
inspiration in the man's face. Conclusion: the man
very likely had inner peace. Other possibility (I'll
take the credit for this one): maybe the man was
hiking a five minute break and wanted to rest in a
quiet place; he saw that his five minutes were up and
Ie walked out briskly so as not to get back to work
late.
4. Faith cannot be taught from a textbook; it has
to come from within. Now the clincher. If anyone
says that faith is hogwash, just tell him about the
man you saw in the church.
A most conclusive argument! . . . ?
My purpose in writing this letter has not been to
oppose Mr. Grothe's seeming faith in "faith." It has
been rather to protest against the unsophisticated
manner in which this subject, on which skilled philos
ophers have spent lifetimes, is passed over in one Bull
Session. A series of mature, intelligently-written
articles on this subject would in my opinion be an
excellent and rewarding project for the Daily to un
dertake. Let us give such matters the full attention
and thought which they require.

for a series of articles by foreign students at Stan
ford on the great world religions, to begin next fall.)
