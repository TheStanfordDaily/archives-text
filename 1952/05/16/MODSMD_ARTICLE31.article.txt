# On Shaken Religious Belief
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I'd like to commend Pr>te Grothe's Bull Session of
May IS concerning religion. I know that many of my

friends who took Western Civ last year had their
religious convictions shaken to the roots. Quite a few
of them became agnostics and one now claims to be
an atheist. I agree that the scientific method of finding
truth is very valuable but it is not the only one, for
as Pete says, there is also faith.
I hope that this Bull Session is not "too little—too
late" for the class of '55 and I suggest that similar
articles be printed next fall quarter so that members
ol the class of 'f>G may not be put in a hopeless state
ol confusion when the existence of God is mentioned
and a civ instructor with a condescending smile say:.
"Prove it."
