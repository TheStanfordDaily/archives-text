# Math, Language vs. Utility
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Disregarding cultural value questions in discussing
the math-language option, one can make a good
utilitarian case against the recent decisions. Few
people really know what they are going to be 01
what they want to be in lower division, or even after
gaining a B.A.
Language is obviously a better preparation for life
in general than mathematics since there are more
foreigners in the world than mathematicians. There
lore, a compulsory language requirement makes
sense.
The major argument raised by the Daily was not
so much against the utility and worth of language
study as such, but against the inadequacy of present
teaching methods. An obvious answer v/ould be
something similar to the grade school requirement,
i.e., a reading examination or some such as a pre
requisite to the B.A.
You could Ret your knowledge either through
courses, tutoring, lingaphone-type records, or any
thing else, and take the exam anytime. Other
schools, even in the U.S., find this very practical.
It might be said few people use the language, and
a language is quickly forgotten. Yet, the world is
becoming more cosmopolitan and closer together all
the time. Also, recalling something once learned is
easier and quicker than learning from scratch.
Besides, returning to culture, what is culture? It
is a large world-heritage. We can never leave the
time or linguistic equipment to delve into the whole,
but the least a liberal arts university should do is
broaden the spectrum of cultural comprehension of
each student.
