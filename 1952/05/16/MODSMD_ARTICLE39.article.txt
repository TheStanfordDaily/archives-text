# Cards, Less Mathias, Enter Modesto Relays
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
Are you a track fan? Would you rather watch a quick mile
than spend the afternoon a'. Rossotti's? If this is you, the greatest
weekend in West Coast and possibly American track is upon us,
as the starting guns fire and the clocks start clicking off times
at the annual Coliseum Relays and Modesto Relays held tonight
and tomorrow night respectively.

A.' far :is Stanford is concerned.
Li lis is just exercise for the FCC I
iinals to be held next Saturday at j
Eugene, Oregon. Stanford won't be
represented in the bi<; Lo.s Angeles
bowi on .Friday night, and will be
running on only partial strength at
Modesto the following night.
The big cylinder missing from the
attack is Bob Mathias. Bit; Bob is
at present in Hawaii, waiting for
the Rainbow Relays to be run off I
tomorrow. His points in the high â– 
hurdles and discus, as well as his I
anchor lap on the 440- an 1 880-;
yard relay teams, will be sorely
missed.
In the two sprint relays, Maury
Pardons will move up to anchor, and
Pete McKay and A 1 Mendel wili fill
the gaps made by Mathias and Bob
iVlagee, still bothered by a bad foot.
Keith Brownsberger rounds out the
quartet. As an experiment, Fred
George and Bill Friedrichs may go
instead of McKay and Mendel in i
the 880-yard relay.
The medley team of Dick Black
(440), captain John Woolley (880),
Hob Reed (1 ~*120), and Bob Simon
(mile) is a new combo that might
just be able to click. If all the
boys come through in proper fash
ion, they might be able to get the
lime down to 10:03 or thereabouts.
Another switch will probably be
in the two-mile relay, where either
Heed or Simon will fill the gap left
by Dave Fletcher, out for the week.
Without Mathias, Stanford will
not enter anyone in the high hur
dles, while lan Reed and Chuck
Renfro will have to fill his shoes in
the discus.
The javelin will feature the team
of Leo Long and Chuck Harlow,
with Bob Kimball, the third man
oj the combo, sidelined with a "jav
elin arm."
