# Cards Swim Cal in Finale
## 
### 
University of California will take
the final crack at marring the Stan
ford swimmers' 1952 unbeaten dual
meet record tomorrow afternoon
when the Bears invade Encina
Plunge at 2 in the afternoon.
The Bears' chances are net great,
however, and Stanford will be fa
vored to run their string of victories
to eight in a row by duplicating the
j (37 to 17 licking administered three
weeks ago.
Nevertheless, several top races
should serve to make the event in
teresting. The only one which in
volves tough Cal competition is the
backstroke with Jim Ross out to
avenge his defeat at the hands of
Stanford freshman Larry Heim.
Since the Indian >' number two
frosh backstroker, John Weiser, will
also be in the thick of things, the
winning time may well erase the
new PCC record of 2:12.8, set only
last week by Heim at SC.
Cards Pete Cole and Danny Os
borne will also be out for a PCC
record in their favorite event, the
440. Cole and Osborne will be gun
ning for the former's mark of 4:40.5
set last year against Cal at Berke
ley.
Other marks which may fall are
the medley relay in which Coach
Tom Haynie has his top combo of
Heim, captain Bob Frojen, and
; Bruce Putnam swimming; and the
J breaststroke, in which either Fro
jen or Ash Jones may be the first
I PCC butterfly man to break 2:20.
