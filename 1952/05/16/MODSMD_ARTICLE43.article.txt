# PRO AND CAHN

A twin win for the Stanford nine
in the Southland this weekend
would give the Cards the CIBA flag
We don't see how they have come
this far.
To us tlicve are two factions on
this year's club, the hustling ball
player with little natural ability
and the basically good ballplayer
who is not driving as bard as he
might.
The spirited, Eddie Stanky type
seems to dominate. It seems a
pity that the buys with the most
ability have not given that bit of
extra effort that goes to make a
great ballplayer, and a better
club.
< The credit for this year's succesr
Mies with the boys who have given
their all in a long uphill fight. Out-

standing per
formances have
been turned in
by Joe Chez,
baseball Joe
himse If, who
lives and .sleeps
baseball. Jack
Shepard has the
attitude of a
great competi-

tor. His bat has started many a
late-inning rally.
Rich Scramaglia has done a bang
up job in filling in for fiery Art
Abrahamson at second. Owen Pow
ell has come close to breaking his
neck giving that "old college try" in
chasing down fly balls. His hustle,
not speed, saved a game up at Ber
keley a week back.
And there are some others.
Team spirit has been good. If it
were not, Stanford would not be
fighting for the flag now. How
ever, if some individuals had 1
given a bit more of themselves
the Indians might have already
cinched the pennant.
