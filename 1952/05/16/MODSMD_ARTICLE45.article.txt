jof this dramat c game as Trucks'
heroic : tint.
The first pitch from Bob Porter
field was a I'msl ball, but inside for
a ball. The next wa.s knee high and
fast. V/trlz slammed it into the
fans, ar.d (he Tiger dugout crew
] split up. Half pounded no-hitter
Trucks' back jubilantly. Half chased
out to gre:;t home-run hitter Wertz.
All except Tiger Coach Rick Fer
rell. ''I can't understand it,"he
muttered. "1 know Trucks didn't
warm up enough before the game.

Trucks laughed. "I was loose,"
| he said. "But I was worried."
This was Trucks' first victory of
the season, and to gain it he walked
one, hit two other batters and a
fourth Washington player reached
base on an error.
