# Soccer Squad Hosts Rovers
## 
### 
The Card soccer team will cross
the half-way mark in its spring
practice competition tomorrow when
it plays host to the Rovers from San
I Francisco.
Game-time will be 1:1)0 on (he
Stanford soccer field.
Superior experience, gained in
San Francisco City League ball,
makes the Rovers pre-game favor
ites.
Coach Leo Weinstein has found a
very strong defensive alignment in
Harry Havilio, Sam Kegister, and
Lou Lane, halls; All-Coa.st Randy
Rosso and John Sentous, fullbacks;
and Pete Zarcades, goalie all of
which may be enough to turn tliu
tide against the City men.
