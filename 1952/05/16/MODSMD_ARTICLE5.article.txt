WASHINGTON—The Navy today
ordered work to begin on the hull
ot the nation's first atomic subma
rine—a revolutionary craft which is
expected to lead to a whole fleet of
fnr - ranging, hard - hitting atomic
warships.
The sub may reach speeds of 35
knots submerged — fast enough to
run down the speediest merchant
ships and make it the greatest sea
killer ever devised.
Work will begin on the submarine
rometime next month and the ves
sel is scheduled to be launched in
1954.
