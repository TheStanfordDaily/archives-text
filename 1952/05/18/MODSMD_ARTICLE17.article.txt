### HADLEY ROFF Daily Political EditoR 
Aic wo entering an era ol smear?
That question is being rammed home now (hat a giant dirt cam
paign, echoing ihn Niirnbcrg rally cries of Hitler's time, is being
slung up in Ihn United States.
Engineered by "The Williams Intelhgency Agency," the hatfc-

mongcring reached -campus last week
when a packet of literature attack
ing Eisenhower was received by the
Daily.
Eisenhower, the Williams agency
reports, is backed by Zionist and
Com munis t in t crests.
In a special "Eisenhower edition"
of the Williams Intelligence Sum
mary, if was claimed that reports
have "associated General Eisenhower
with the left wing, alien interna
tionalists."
Named as "left wing" hackers of
• lie General arc (Jov. Dewey, Sen
ators Ives, Lodge, Duff, Douglas,
and Morse, and"the extreme left
ists" .lames Roosevelt and Helen
Gahagan Douglas.
The report continues, "You will
observe that Walter Winchell still is
crusading for Eisenhower, as lie has
been for several years. Winchell and
Drew Pearson are two best known
radio mouthpieces for ADL propa
ganda."
According to Williams the ADL,
the Anti-Defamation League, "ad
mitting it. is Zionist, now posing as
Anti-Communist, supports the same
Marxist world revolution as the
Communist party."
T!ie author of the summary,
l.'obcit II Williams of Santa Ana,

Calif., says lie was a counter-in
lelligeoee officer with Ihe Army
Air Force during World War 11.
lie is not listed in "Who's Who" or
in "Current Biographies."
Harping on Eisenhower's "Red
catering record" the agency says that
the general "caroused with Zhukov
and other high Soviet criminals. He
liked Ihe kind of parties and com
panions they furnished."
Source for their charge was a
picture taken soon after V-E day
showing General Eisenhower talk
ing with Marshall Zhukov. Eisen
hower had a glass in his hand.
The charge thai the meeting of the
two men constitutes "close associa
tion" or in international conspiracy
is not supported.
Zhukov, soon after the war, dis
appeared from the Russian scene,
the apparent victim of a purge. He
was one of the few ranking Russians
who was not a member of the Com
munist party.
Another example of Eisenhower's
supposed Communist leanings, Wil -
liams states, is the general's first
"political speech" after the war. It
'must have surprised many Ameri
cans, for he chose a CIO convention
At that time the CIO was at 'he
peak of its Communist setving ca
reer."
In a statement of policy, Williams
declares, "Thr publisher lielieves
that those basic carriers of Com
munism and political Zionism who
attempt to hide behind the Jewish
religion must he mercilessly ex
posed, hoth to discourage them and
to malfo the American citizen un
derstand the nature of the sub
versive attack against this nation,
its institutions, and ds people,"
But id making tlie "citizen under
stand," Williams in his eight-page
report does not attempt to cinch his
charges with fact.
