# Plea for More Libe Hours
## 
### 
Requests for a well lighted study room some
where on campus open alter 10:30 perennially
pour in from the student body, and again this
year the problem has come before Excom.
In iesponse to these requests, ASSU Presi
dent Wayne Alley recently wrote Library Di
rector Raynard C. Swank asking that "library fa
cilities lemain open some place on campus until
midnight." The main argument he gave, ac
cording to Mr. Swank, was that students needed
a quiet place to study.
hast week, Excom heard the library officials'
reply that they did not feel justified in asking
President Sterling for the funds required "when
tlii:; measure would be merely a reflection of
the students' inability to enforce sufficient dis
cipline to make study possible in the houses."
He suggested action by the living groups them
selves as a better solution.
But this does not mean the matter is closed.
Mr. Swank is willing to consider either a con
vincing case against his point ot view or
"other and more proper reasons" tor keeping
study space open. So it is up to Ey.com to pre
sent a strong argument it it wants the reguest
met.
We believe Excom has grounds for a strong
rase. Previous experience with extra library
hours has proved highly successful. For ex
ample, the library will keep the Reserve Book
Room open later during Dead Week and finals
again this quarter. Mr. Swank reports that at
tendance studies have shown this practice to

be well worth while. Then, too, the fact that
students have bothered to request more study
space is further indication of a definite need.
And what are the arguments on the stu
dents' side? They want a guiet place to study.
The library undoubtedly has a point when it
suggests living group discipline. In a resi
dence where a majority are being kept from
studying by an inconsiderate few, the ma
jority should take action. But when the situa
tion is reversed ----- when the majority has
chosen to spend the evening in a noise-mak
ing activity—is it fair to deny the minority a
refuge?
More study space is needed for other reasons.
Many living groups are crowded and poorly
lit. Anyone who has tried to study in a triple
will appreciate the difficulties involved". Other
students with v/hom we have talked feel that
books on reserve should be available until later
at night. Of course, one book for each course
can be checked out, but this is little help to the
student who has small assignments in several
books. Keeping the Reserve Book Room open
until midnight would solve all this.
But actually, the crux of the problem is this:
students, for whatever their reasons may be,
have chosen the library as a desirable place iO
study. The library thus has a further chance to
serve them, and it is up to Excom to make them
see the possibilities for this service.
