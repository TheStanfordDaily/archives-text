## Orchids to the Spring Show 
### PETE GROTHE 
To steal a Walter Winchell gimmick, "orchids" go
to the cast of "Finian's Rainbow."
Liert Berns as Woody Mahoney showed ;i strong
and pleasing voice and Pat Currier as Sharon acted
lur part excellently. However, the real show-stealer
w:. George ("Fairyland was never like this") Denny.
Denny, as the nimble-footed leprechaun, surpassed
anything he has ever done in the way of theatrics.
Aad it was not without some reason that many walked
out of Mem Aud gasping, "What are we going to do
without Denny next year?"

Not far behind Denny was Hal
Todd, who as Finian was straight
out of Barry Fitzgerald. And we
can't leave out Jane Bowan's
name. As Susan the silent, she
turned in the best piece of danc
ing that I've seen in a Ram's
Head production.
Still more plaudits. John Erick
son's orchestra was close to flaw
less and Ray O'Brien's chorus did
. difficult job and did it well.

Hal Burdick Jr., as Senator Billboard Rawkins,
turned in an inspired piece of acting. It was a part
thai easily could have been overdone, but Burdick
j'.ave it all it was worth and still didn't overact. Also,
he had the best line in the show. When asked if he
had ever read the Constitution, he replied, "Read it?
HeÂ«.k no, I'm too busy defending it to read it."
Htil that s only hall the slorv of this or any Spring
Mioiv. For every person who sinus or ads on the
singe there are more oIT the stage who contribute to
tin' play's success. Robin Stevens, is the chief
rooster of the whole production, took a complicated
play and directed it so that it hummed.
Then, behind stage, a bunch of officious-looking
t'nli and stage managers ran around barking orders.
Thereby making themselves unpopular with the ac
tor-; and chorus, who considers the tech crew a neces
sary evil.

And so "Finian's Rainbow" was more than just
actors, singers, dancers, and leprechauns. It was di
rectors, lighting men, prop ineri, curtain raisers, make
up men, set men, and fly men.
I submit that there is something deliciously col
legiate about Spring Shows in general and "Finian's
Rainbow" in particular. It was great.

ONE FOOT IN HEAVEN DEPT. Stanford almost
lost footballer-wrestler Rod Garner last week. For
good.
Rod, an ex-paratrooper, had nothing much to do
one day last week, so he contacted Bud Nutting, an
other ex-paratrooper, and said, "Well, Bud, it's a
nice day. How about a few jumps into the wild blue
yonder today?"
"Okay," says Bud.
A half hour later, (hey took off in Alex Kosloff's
plane and prepared to jump. From about 2,000 feet,
Nutting jumped, pulled the ripchord and glided
smoothly to the ground. Also, from about 2,000 feet,
Garner leaped, pulled the ripchord.
And nothing happened.
Two thousand feet is a long distance, but when
you're negotiating it vertically, it doesn't take too
long to hit the bottom.
Fifteen hundred feet, 1,000 feet, 500 feet and still
the parachute didn't open. It was straight from the
script of a Class B movie, except that this was pain
fully real.
Four hundred, .'{oo. 200 feet, and footballer John
liroderick, who was watching the proceedings from
the ground, began saying prayers for his fraternity
brother.
Then, at 150 feet, Garner gave his ripchord one more
frantic jerk. And the parachute opened.
Rod hit the ground hard, but very much alive.
Said Eroderick a moment later, "Rod, babe, I thought
you w<?re going all the way."
Was Garner fazed by all this? No, he went up for
another jump.
