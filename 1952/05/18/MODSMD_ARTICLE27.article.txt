# Row: Fun Plus Responsibility
## 
### CAROLYN MARTIN 
For ihe woman considering
life on the Row two factors must
be considered. On one end of
the scale aie the advantages of
living in a unified group, plus
the informal spirit and numer
ous activities of a house of ap
proximately 35 girls.
But at the same lime, contrast this
with somewhat over-crowded con
ditions, responsibilities, and compul
sory duties.
The duties include washing after
dinner coffee cups; counting laundry
(towels and sheets are pooled to
gether in most houses); fire, phone,
and (lower duty; and attending social
functions. In some houses duties fall
only to the sophomores, in some to
the new girls, in others everyone
takes part.
Dues vary from $5 to $f0 per
quarter, and include house social
activities, exchanges, dances, giits,
phone calls, and laundry costs.
Women on the Row use the key
system. This means each girl has a
key and is responsible for returning
to the house at a designated time.
Neither the house mother nor the
resident assistant waits up for the
girls.
Breakfast on the Row is from 7:15
to 8:30 and girls may go to the
kitchen in their pajamas.
Where lunches are cafeteria style
girls may take their trays in the
living room or to the terrace. All
dinners are served "sit-down" style.
Some houses have after-dinner coffee
in the living room every night; oth
ers only once a week or when they
have guests.
In choosing a place to live, the de
cision doesn't depend on whether the
house is big or small, crowded or
not, but on the desires of the in
dividual and the amount of time she
is willing to spend in making it the
"right place" for her.
