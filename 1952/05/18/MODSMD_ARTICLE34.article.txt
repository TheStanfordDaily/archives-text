# Thinclads in Tie for Second at Modesto
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
Shades of Mercury! Bob Simon had his day, and wiih him, the
Stanford track team picked itself up and pushed foxwaid tu a
second-place tie in the Modesto Relays.
First place, as usual, went to the eternal Trojan with 46 2/7 |
points, followed by Stanford and the U.S. Air Force, each with 20.

I fact, Hal and his brother Stan were
bothering the Indians all the time
with powerful hitting and tremen
i dous fielding.
! Ye terday's batting stars were
really Cards Warren Goodrich, who
I got to base all five times with four
j singles and an error, and Jack Shep
ard, who slapped out five srtaight
singles. Their hits just weren't
enough as they either died on base
or teammates were cut down with
sleepy baserunning.
Bad Inning for Chez
Today Joe Chez was the sad vic
tim of a very bad first inning. He
was completely ineffective, appar
ently not warmed up enough. Five
runs.scored that first inning on three
hits and. four walks. From then on
Joe limited SC to only two hits nad
a lone run that came after bad
handling of an easy bunt in the sixth
inning.
Dick Cole was the batting star for
the Indians with a single that scored
two runs in the third and a homer
with Artie Abrahamson aboard in
the fifth. No one else had much of
a day at the plate, but the Indians
did outhit USC with nine to six.
A ninth inning rally looked like
it would turn the tide for the in
creasingly stronger Joe Chez, but it
fell one run short of tying up the
ball game. Dave Cesca's reliefer,
sophomore Don Young, had trouble
finding the plate.
Pinch-hitter Hal Skillman, batting
for Corzine, struck out. Jim Agar,
at plate for Chez, got to the initial
sack on an error. Abrahamson and
Goodrich were walked t.o fill,up the
bases. Then Cole was out, short to
first, but Dave Rosenkrantz, running
for Agar, got home with the fifth
run.
Snepard then dribbled a roller to
Shortstop Hal Charnofsky, who
gobbled up the ball and flipped to
first to end the CIBA season.
The Indians battled all the way,
but just didn't match the experienced
Trojans in polish and come-through.

♦ The big race i.l the day, as Hi!
| a; Far.n enthusiasts wv concerned,
; was the medley re', y.it .start .1 oil

j cioeked off the Mi-yard lap in :50
fiat. Then captain John V/oolley
came through with a hurt to go
around the track twice in Lfj" a;
j Bob Heed t id the 1 ,'12() in .VU'i; and
\ coming up to the last lap, Stanford
was approximately if> yards behind
; SC's A: t Garcia.
Then the baton wns given to
Hob Simon, ami the ra.ee started
anew. Simon pulled up slowly,
inching after the raj: id Trojan and
finally catching ii i m nmvng
around the last lap. Ir.io the
j stretch, it was Garcia and Simon,
stride for sttid.', to the t; ne. With
| a hinge, Simon get his >houl er
i in fir t by little over an inch—
| enough to {jive Stnnfo* d the win
ning watches and a second place
[ in the meet. Simon's unofficial
time, as clocked by Co;. Hi Jark
Wciershaiiser, was a lit' time best
j of 4:1!. Time for the relay was
' an exceptional 10:01.').
From then on the unexpected
was the expected. Cluck Rer.iVo
took a fourth in tiie discus at 154
j feet 7'/a inches; Stanford took third,
J again ahead of SC, in the two-mile
I relay; and Leo Long took a th : .\i in
l tiie javelin at 211 feet 5 incites,
j Stanford took fourth in the 4io
- yard relay, Howii Hertz and Chuck
j Hokanson took second and third in
I the shot put behind SC's phenom,
Ferry O'Brien, and a third in the
! mile relay.
Shades of Mercury! Bob Simon had his day, and wiih him, the
Stanford track team picked itself up and pushed foxwaid tu a
second-place tie in the Modesto Relays.
First place, as usual, went to the eternal Trojan with 46 2/7 |
points, followed by Stanford and the U.S. Air Force, each with 20.

I fact, Hal and his brother Stan were
bothering the Indians all the time
with powerful hitting and tremen
i dous fielding.
! Ye terday's batting stars were
really Cards Warren Goodrich, who
I got to base all five times with four
j singles and an error, and Jack Shep
ard, who slapped out five srtaight
singles. Their hits just weren't
enough as they either died on base
or teammates were cut down with
sleepy baserunning.
Bad Inning for Chez
Today Joe Chez was the sad vic
tim of a very bad first inning. He
was completely ineffective, appar
ently not warmed up enough. Five
runs.scored that first inning on three
hits and. four walks. From then on
Joe limited SC to only two hits nad
a lone run that came after bad
handling of an easy bunt in the sixth
inning.
Dick Cole was the batting star for
the Indians with a single that scored
two runs in the third and a homer
with Artie Abrahamson aboard in
the fifth. No one else had much of
a day at the plate, but the Indians
did outhit USC with nine to six.
A ninth inning rally looked like
it would turn the tide for the in
creasingly stronger Joe Chez, but it
fell one run short of tying up the
ball game. Dave Cesca's reliefer,
sophomore Don Young, had trouble
finding the plate.
Pinch-hitter Hal Skillman, batting
for Corzine, struck out. Jim Agar,
at plate for Chez, got to the initial
sack on an error. Abrahamson and
Goodrich were walked t.o fill,up the
bases. Then Cole was out, short to
first, but Dave Rosenkrantz, running
for Agar, got home with the fifth
run.
Snepard then dribbled a roller to
Shortstop Hal Charnofsky, who
gobbled up the ball and flipped to
first to end the CIBA season.
The Indians battled all the way,
but just didn't match the experienced
Trojans in polish and come-through.

around the track twice in Lfj" a;

\ coming up to the last lap, Stanford
was approximately if> yards behind

Then the baton wns given to
Hob Simon, ami the ra.ee started
anew. Simon pulled up slowly,
inching after the raj: id Trojan and
finally catching ii i m nmvng
around the last lap. Ir.io the
j stretch, it was Garcia and Simon,

i in fir t by little over an inch—

ning watches and a second place
[ in the meet. Simon's unofficial
time, as clocked by Co;. Hi Jark
Wciershaiiser, was a lit' time best
j of 4:1!. Time for the relay was
' an exceptional 10:01.').
From then on the unexpected
was the expected. Cluck Rer.iVo
took a fourth in tiie discus at 154
j feet 7'/a inches; Stanford took third,
J again ahead of SC, in the two-mile
I relay; and Leo Long took a th : .\i in
l tiie javelin at 211 feet 5 incites,
j Stanford took fourth in the 4io
- yard relay, Howii Hertz and Chuck
j Hokanson took second and third in
I the shot put behind SC's phenom,
Ferry O'Brien, and a third in the
! mile relay.
Shades of Mercury! Bob Simon had his day, and wiih him, the
Stanford track team picked itself up and pushed foxwaid tu a
second-place tie in the Modesto Relays.
First place, as usual, went to the eternal Trojan with 46 2/7 |
points, followed by Stanford and the U.S. Air Force, each with 20.

I fact, Hal and his brother Stan were
bothering the Indians all the time
with powerful hitting and tremen
i dous fielding.
! Ye terday's batting stars were
really Cards Warren Goodrich, who
I got to base all five times with four
j singles and an error, and Jack Shep
ard, who slapped out five srtaight
singles. Their hits just weren't
enough as they either died on base
or teammates were cut down with
sleepy baserunning.
Bad Inning for Chez
Today Joe Chez was the sad vic
tim of a very bad first inning. He
was completely ineffective, appar
ently not warmed up enough. Five
runs.scored that first inning on three
hits and. four walks. From then on
Joe limited SC to only two hits nad
a lone run that came after bad
handling of an easy bunt in the sixth
inning.
Dick Cole was the batting star for
the Indians with a single that scored
two runs in the third and a homer
with Artie Abrahamson aboard in
the fifth. No one else had much of
a day at the plate, but the Indians
did outhit USC with nine to six.
A ninth inning rally looked like
it would turn the tide for the in
creasingly stronger Joe Chez, but it
fell one run short of tying up the
ball game. Dave Cesca's reliefer,
sophomore Don Young, had trouble
finding the plate.
Pinch-hitter Hal Skillman, batting
for Corzine, struck out. Jim Agar,
at plate for Chez, got to the initial
sack on an error. Abrahamson and
Goodrich were walked t.o fill,up the
bases. Then Cole was out, short to
first, but Dave Rosenkrantz, running
for Agar, got home with the fifth
run.
Snepard then dribbled a roller to
Shortstop Hal Charnofsky, who
gobbled up the ball and flipped to
first to end the CIBA season.
The Indians battled all the way,
but just didn't match the experienced
Trojans in polish and come-through.

[ in the meet. Simon's unofficial
time, as clocked by Co;. Hi Jark
Wciershaiiser, was a lit' time best
j of 4:1!. Time for the relay was
' an exceptional 10:01.').
From then on the unexpected
was the expected. Cluck Rer.iVo
took a fourth in tiie discus at 154
j feet 7'/a inches; Stanford took third,
J again ahead of SC, in the two-mile
I relay; and Leo Long took a th : .\i in
l tiie javelin at 211 feet 5 incites,
j Stanford took fourth in the 4io
- yard relay, Howii Hertz and Chuck
j Hokanson took second and third in
I the shot put behind SC's phenom,
Ferry O'Brien, and a third in the
! mile relay.
Shades of Mercury! Bob Simon had his day, and wiih him, the
Stanford track team picked itself up and pushed foxwaid tu a
second-place tie in the Modesto Relays.
First place, as usual, went to the eternal Trojan with 46 2/7 |
points, followed by Stanford and the U.S. Air Force, each with 20.

I fact, Hal and his brother Stan were
bothering the Indians all the time
with powerful hitting and tremen
i dous fielding.
! Ye terday's batting stars were
really Cards Warren Goodrich, who
I got to base all five times with four
j singles and an error, and Jack Shep
ard, who slapped out five srtaight
singles. Their hits just weren't
enough as they either died on base
or teammates were cut down with
sleepy baserunning.
Bad Inning for Chez
Today Joe Chez was the sad vic
tim of a very bad first inning. He
was completely ineffective, appar
ently not warmed up enough. Five
runs.scored that first inning on three
hits and. four walks. From then on
Joe limited SC to only two hits nad
a lone run that came after bad
handling of an easy bunt in the sixth
inning.
Dick Cole was the batting star for
the Indians with a single that scored
two runs in the third and a homer
with Artie Abrahamson aboard in
the fifth. No one else had much of
a day at the plate, but the Indians
did outhit USC with nine to six.
A ninth inning rally looked like
it would turn the tide for the in
creasingly stronger Joe Chez, but it
fell one run short of tying up the
ball game. Dave Cesca's reliefer,
sophomore Don Young, had trouble
finding the plate.
Pinch-hitter Hal Skillman, batting
for Corzine, struck out. Jim Agar,
at plate for Chez, got to the initial
sack on an error. Abrahamson and
Goodrich were walked t.o fill,up the
bases. Then Cole was out, short to
first, but Dave Rosenkrantz, running
for Agar, got home with the fifth
run.
Snepard then dribbled a roller to
Shortstop Hal Charnofsky, who
gobbled up the ball and flipped to
first to end the CIBA season.
The Indians battled all the way,
but just didn't match the experienced
Trojans in polish and come-through.
