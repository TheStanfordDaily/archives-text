# Netters Split In Southland
## 
### 
The tennis team flew down to
Los Angeles over the v/eekend and
came back with a 5 to 4 victory
over USC and a 0 to 3 loss to
UCLA.
Friday's defeat of SC was Stan
ford's second win over the Trojans
in ten years. The meet was nip and
tuck all the way and was not de
cided untii the last doubles match
when Art Fish and George Gentry
edged out Allan Cleveland and Don
Eisenburg 6-1, 9-11, 6-4 on the sev
enth match point.
The outstanding player of the
day was fast-rising Art Fish, who
won both his singles and the de
ciding doubles match.
UCLA proved to be too powerful
for the Card netters on Saturday.
Stanford was downed 6 to 3; how
ever, Coach Bob Renker's netmen
showed much improvement over
their previous 8 to 1 loss to the
Bruins. Providing a double win for
the Indians, George Gentry was
Stanford's top performer that day.
