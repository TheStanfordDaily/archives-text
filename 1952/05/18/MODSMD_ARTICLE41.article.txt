### PHIL BERMAN 
Muffling the bats of Vallejo JC
after the third inning, the Stan
ford Braves won their 13th in a row
Saturday, 8 to 4, on the Sunken
Diamond.
The North Bay Redskins collected
all of their four hits and two of
their runs off Gil Duncan in the
first three innings and then were
blanked the rest of the way in the
hit department by Stan Fetterman
and Ron Hoffman.
The Braves clinched the game in
the bottom of the third when they
tallied five runs.
Clarke Nelson and Gil Duncan
singled for the first run. Then a
sacrifice, an error, and a bunt sin
gle by Hog Irvine filled the bases.
A walk to Terry Evans and an in
field out by Gordy Galloway put
the jayvees ahead for good. A bunt
by Sid Hall reloaded the sacks, and
the final two runs traipsed in on
a wild pickoff attempt by Vallejo
backstop Warren Adams that ended
up in left field.
A sixth run counted in the fifth
for the Braves when Terry Evans
was safe on an error and counted
on Sid Hall's line shot to right cen
ter.
Run number seven scored in the
seventh on Gordy Galloway's sin
gle, a stolen base, and a wild throw
by second baseman Jim Rogers.
The final run scored in the eighth
when three errors brought Clarke
Nelson around the bases.
The best bit of pitching turned in
by Dick Clegg's mound trio was by
Stan Fetterman. In his three-in
ning .stint southpaw Stan allowed
only one man to reach base and
fanned three.
Ron Hoffman also pitched pond
ball but was hampered by sloppy
support and wildness.
