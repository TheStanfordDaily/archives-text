silence in the Stanford dressing

dropped the List half of a two
game series with USC for the
CIBA crown, 6 to 5.
Over in the Trojan locker room
there were loud, happy .strains of
"McNamara's Band." But, it, was

Chez. SC was a poor host, in taking
both ends and also in giving Cardinal
Joe his first and only loss of his
senior hurling year.
InHiftns Outliil Troy
Stanford batters outhit the Tro
jans both days, but that was only
part of the picture. Because SC marie
every hit count and tightened up
defensively every time Stanford had
Indians on the base paths.
On the other hand, Coach Everett
Dean's game crew ran the bases
carelessly and failed to play good
ball afield in spite of the few errors
actually chalked up by the official
scorer.
The showings of SC's vaunted
pitchers were quite disappointing.
Tom Lovrich, who entered the game
with a 10-1 record, had to be yanked
in the seventh inning. He had given
up 14 basehits and six runs in the

innings lie worked. His relief, Bob
Sperling, was very effective, how
ever.
Allowed only Six Hits
Stanford's old Dutchman allotted
only a total of six hits, as he struck
out four and walked the same num
ber. But these hits included a homer,
a triple, and two doubles, all com
ing with men aboard. That was the
preciseness of the Trojan attack,
making each hit count. And three
of the free passes resulted in runs
scored.
Rog still appeared to have the
game won until the bottom of the
eighth when the Trojans scored two
runs on a walk, a fielder's choice, a
triple by Hal Charnofsky, -and a long

Tom Lovrich, who entered the game
