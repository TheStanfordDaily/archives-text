# Brilliant, Balanced Program By Ricci Ends Concert Series
## 
### 
Hugqiero IVci. one of llie foremost younger violinists in th®
woild today, brought the current Concert Series to a brilliant con
clusion with a dazzling and well-balanced program.
Scarlatti's Sonata in D Minor, in an arrangement by Alfredo
Casella, was played in a smooth, flowing style which was alto
gether suited to this oarly music. There were never any excesses

of emotion or exaggerations in <
phrasing. Even as pure as Ins style I
was, Ricci never seemed to get l-e- |
low the surface in this sonata or in
the four excerpts from the Bach i
Partita which followed.
His playing became rather per
functory in sonic of the faster
pas .ages of the Bach, as he Hid
not capture the spirit of the
music. Even mo, Ricri did turn in
some fine fiddling which found
every note in place, and in the
proper pitch.
Turning to the "Kreutzer" Sonata
by Beethoven. Ricci seemed to pet
much closer to the music. The first
movement, although a little overly
robust at times, had a rugged vigor
about it which raised the perform
ance above being merely d techni
cal display for the soloist. The vari
ations of the second movement were
tossed off in fine style, but Ricci
oj l not. do much more than play
notes.
Perhaps above all he is a tech
nician who gives good stable per
formances of works such as this
but he fails to search for what it,
in the music, frequently playing
merely what is on the printed
page. The last movement found
him a little more at home, but
much better Beethoven was to be
heard from Theodore Saidenberg,
who handled the piano part ex
cellently.
After the intermission. Ricci
launched into a group of short com
positions which were much more
suited to him, judging from the way
in which his playing seemed to im
prove. The graceful folk melodies
in the Bartok Sonatine were given
the benefit of a near-perfect tech
nique and fine tone. Tschaikowsky's
►Scherzo. Rachmaninoff's Vocalise,
and Kreisler's "La Chasse" were
not only plyaed with the utmost
brilliance, but also with loving care.
Ricci drew prolonged applause
from the audience for his perform
ance of "1 Palpiti" by Paganini
The tremendous difficulties were
handled with the utmost ease as he
tossed off the double stops (in oc
tives) at breath-taking speed, and
with excellent tone.

brilliance, but also with loving care.
Ricci drew prolonged applause
from the audience for his perform
ance of "1 Palpiti" by Paganini
The tremendous difficulties were
handled with the utmost ease as he
tossed off the double stops (in oc
tives) at breath-taking speed, and
with excellent tone.
Hugqiero IVci. one of llie foremost younger violinists in th®
woild today, brought the current Concert Series to a brilliant con
clusion with a dazzling and well-balanced program.
Scarlatti's Sonata in D Minor, in an arrangement by Alfredo
Casella, was played in a smooth, flowing style which was alto
gether suited to this oarly music. There were never any excesses

of emotion or exaggerations in <
phrasing. Even as pure as Ins style I
was, Ricci never seemed to get l-e- |
low the surface in this sonata or in
the four excerpts from the Bach i
Partita which followed.
His playing became rather per
functory in sonic of the faster
pas .ages of the Bach, as he Hid
not capture the spirit of the
music. Even mo, Ricri did turn in
some fine fiddling which found
every note in place, and in the
proper pitch.
Turning to the "Kreutzer" Sonata
by Beethoven. Ricci seemed to pet
much closer to the music. The first
movement, although a little overly
robust at times, had a rugged vigor
about it which raised the perform
ance above being merely d techni
cal display for the soloist. The vari
ations of the second movement were
tossed off in fine style, but Ricci
oj l not. do much more than play
notes.
Perhaps above all he is a tech
nician who gives good stable per
formances of works such as this
but he fails to search for what it,
in the music, frequently playing
merely what is on the printed
page. The last movement found
him a little more at home, but
much better Beethoven was to be
heard from Theodore Saidenberg,
who handled the piano part ex
cellently.
After the intermission. Ricci
launched into a group of short com
positions which were much more
suited to him, judging from the way
in which his playing seemed to im
prove. The graceful folk melodies
in the Bartok Sonatine were given
the benefit of a near-perfect tech
nique and fine tone. Tschaikowsky's
►Scherzo. Rachmaninoff's Vocalise,
and Kreisler's "La Chasse" were
not only plyaed with the utmost
brilliance, but also with loving care.
