# Foreign Aid and Dollars and Cents
## 
### 
Ta these inflationary days of high govern
ment expenditures, military and otherwise, it
luis become almost a matter ol course that Con
gress cut administration appropriation bills. It
ia just assumed that administrative estimates
aie too high.
One ot the leaders of the "stop-this-reckless
spending-spree" school consistently has been
Ohio's senior senator, Robert Taft.
The most recent example is furnished by the
administration's proposed $7,900,000,000 for
eign aid bill, on which Taft's views again bring
him into direct conflict with General Eisen
hower.
Taft favors a lopping off of considerably
more than the billion dollar cut the Senate For
eign Relations Committee has already made.
Eisenhower, more inclined to think ol arming
Europe in terms ol material need than dollars
and cents, was apalled by Taft's recommenda
tion.
We don't think the split can be simply
labeled as "isolationism" versus "international

ism." It is a matter more of degree than of ex
tremes. And when Taft insists he has no basic
disagreement with Eisenhower on foreign pol
icy, we must conclude that he is more con
cerned with a campaign issue in the present
controversy than long-range values. *
Doubtless, congressional cuts in administra
tion bills have prevented reckless expenditures.
Doubtless, inaccurate estimates on complex
projects have reguired a scaling downward of
some proposed appropriations.
Hut to assume automatically that administra
tion bills should be chopped as Taft has as
sumed fairly consistently, we feel is placing
political advantage above long-range values.
We don't know if international security can
be bought. We do know, however, that it can
not be bought cheaply. And we feel there are
values, among them security, that are more
important than short-sighted dollar and cent
considerations.
But Taft light now doesn't seem to be looking
much further than the July nominations.
