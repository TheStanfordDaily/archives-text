## A 						Story About Horace 
### KIP TODD 
Some years ago in southern France there lived a
young Cro-Magnon man named Horace. His whole
nsme was Horace the Intrepid and Fearless Sabre
toothed Tiger Killer, but his friends all called him
Horace, and who could blame them?
"Now what in the world is there to do today?"
Horace used to say as he left his cave in the morning
in search of roots and berries. Horace was never one
to eat sabre-toothed tigers; he just killed them lor fun.
"Not a damned thing," he would answer himself.
He always answered himself because he was the only
Cro-Magnon man who could speak English. Very

advanced for his time, Horace.
And then Horace would wend his
weary way westward in search of
wood. (Actually he never looked
fur wood, but it sounds pretty
; ood that way.) And on the way
he would try to think of things
to do. He never thought of a
thing.
One day he came upon his
friends in a cave several miles
away from the town where

they all lived. They were laughing and talking and
clapping their hands as if a great thing had hap
pened. It had. They had learned to paint on the
walls of the cave with various pigments made out
of rocks and stones and berries. They were paint
ing pictures of animals, men, trees, and things that
they had never seen before so as to fool the archae
ologists who would look at them in later years.
"What in the hell are you doing?" asked Horace
ponderously.
No one answered. They didn't speak English.
"Urripa gimlimpoot filimoptuy?" asked Horace again.
"What do you think we're doing?" they answered.
"vVt-'re painting pictures of animals, men, trees, and
tilings that we have never seen before so as to fool
the archaeologists who will look at them in later
years. What else would we be doing?"
Horace was stunned. He was taken aback. He
scratched his head. He licked his lips. He did the
Mexican Shuffle. He waved his arms. He spat. "A
Bad Thing!" he cried. "A Very Bad Tiling!"
Horace's friends didn't quite know what to think.

Tliey looked at him and asked in unison, "What do
you mean by that, Horace the Intrepid and Fearless
Sabre-toothed Tiger Killer?" (They v/ere speaking
to him formally now.)
"I mean that you are destroying the beauty of
nature and causing yourselves to become vulgar by
allowing yourselves to become immortal," said Hor
ace. "And what's more, immortality is for the
Greeks, Let the world wait for them."
His friends threw rocks at him and told him what
for. "What ior," they said.
"Bah!" said Horace and walked away muttering to
himself and thinking evil thoughts.
The very next day as Horace was wending his
weary way westward in search of water (he actually
didn't look lor water either), he came upon a little
girl sitting on a rock and dreaming of things to come.
In her left hand she was holding a golden hair pin
and in her right hand a silver potty. Horace ap
proached on his knees, wondering what the hell the
world was coming to, anyway. "Little girl," he asked
in wonder, "what in the hell is the world coming to,
anyway? Why are you sitting on that rock thinking
of things to come and holding a golden hairpin in one
hand and a silver potty in the other?"
"I am the spirit of Christmas yet to come," she
answered simply, Hulling out her golden hair and
adjusting her panty-girdle. "1 am here to warn you
of your folly and to tell you of the trouble that can
come to you for being different."
"This sounds strangely like a message in this fable,"
thought Horace. "Tell me, then," he said out loud,
"what is wrong with what I have done and what
trouble can I get into for being different?"
"The ways of the world are hard," she said cryp
tically, "and the ways of man are even harder. There
will be days on end when there will not be a silver
lining and even then it will be blurred by the wind.
So go back to the cave, Horace, and paint on the wall.
Paint the best damned sabre-toothed tiger that the
world has ever seen." She didn't disappear at all alter
thiis, but she did the next best thing: she went to
sleep.
Horace didn't go back to the cave at all. He wound
his weary way further westward in search of women.
The rest of the Cro-Magnon men died. Horace started
a fertility cult. •

Some years ago in southern France there lived a
young Cro-Magnon man named Horace. His whole
nsme was Horace the Intrepid and Fearless Sabre
toothed Tiger Killer, but his friends all called him
Horace, and who could blame them?
"Now what in the world is there to do today?"
Horace used to say as he left his cave in the morning
in search of roots and berries. Horace was never one
to eat sabre-toothed tigers; he just killed them lor fun.
"Not a damned thing," he would answer himself.
He always answered himself because he was the only
Cro-Magnon man who could speak English. Very

advanced for his time, Horace.
And then Horace would wend his
weary way westward in search of
wood. (Actually he never looked
fur wood, but it sounds pretty
; ood that way.) And on the way
he would try to think of things
to do. He never thought of a
thing.
One day he came upon his
friends in a cave several miles
away from the town where

they all lived. They were laughing and talking and
clapping their hands as if a great thing had hap
pened. It had. They had learned to paint on the
walls of the cave with various pigments made out
of rocks and stones and berries. They were paint
ing pictures of animals, men, trees, and things that
they had never seen before so as to fool the archae
ologists who would look at them in later years.
"What in the hell are you doing?" asked Horace
ponderously.
No one answered. They didn't speak English.
"Urripa gimlimpoot filimoptuy?" asked Horace again.
"What do you think we're doing?" they answered.
"vVt-'re painting pictures of animals, men, trees, and
tilings that we have never seen before so as to fool
the archaeologists who will look at them in later
years. What else would we be doing?"
Horace was stunned. He was taken aback. He
scratched his head. He licked his lips. He did the
Mexican Shuffle. He waved his arms. He spat. "A
Bad Thing!" he cried. "A Very Bad Tiling!"
Horace's friends didn't quite know what to think.

Tliey looked at him and asked in unison, "What do
you mean by that, Horace the Intrepid and Fearless
Sabre-toothed Tiger Killer?" (They v/ere speaking
to him formally now.)
"I mean that you are destroying the beauty of
nature and causing yourselves to become vulgar by
allowing yourselves to become immortal," said Hor
ace. "And what's more, immortality is for the
Greeks, Let the world wait for them."
His friends threw rocks at him and told him what
for. "What ior," they said.
"Bah!" said Horace and walked away muttering to
himself and thinking evil thoughts.
The very next day as Horace was wending his
weary way westward in search of water (he actually
didn't look lor water either), he came upon a little
girl sitting on a rock and dreaming of things to come.
In her left hand she was holding a golden hair pin
and in her right hand a silver potty. Horace ap
proached on his knees, wondering what the hell the
world was coming to, anyway. "Little girl," he asked
in wonder, "what in the hell is the world coming to,
anyway? Why are you sitting on that rock thinking
of things to come and holding a golden hairpin in one
hand and a silver potty in the other?"
"I am the spirit of Christmas yet to come," she
answered simply, Hulling out her golden hair and
adjusting her panty-girdle. "1 am here to warn you
of your folly and to tell you of the trouble that can
come to you for being different."
"This sounds strangely like a message in this fable,"
thought Horace. "Tell me, then," he said out loud,
"what is wrong with what I have done and what
trouble can I get into for being different?"
"The ways of the world are hard," she said cryp
tically, "and the ways of man are even harder. There
will be days on end when there will not be a silver
lining and even then it will be blurred by the wind.
So go back to the cave, Horace, and paint on the wall.
Paint the best damned sabre-toothed tiger that the
world has ever seen." She didn't disappear at all alter
thiis, but she did the next best thing: she went to
sleep.
Horace didn't go back to the cave at all. He wound
his weary way further westward in search of women.
The rest of the Cro-Magnon men died. Horace started
a fertility cult. •

Some years ago in southern France there lived a
young Cro-Magnon man named Horace. His whole
nsme was Horace the Intrepid and Fearless Sabre
toothed Tiger Killer, but his friends all called him
Horace, and who could blame them?
"Now what in the world is there to do today?"
Horace used to say as he left his cave in the morning
in search of roots and berries. Horace was never one
to eat sabre-toothed tigers; he just killed them lor fun.
"Not a damned thing," he would answer himself.
He always answered himself because he was the only
Cro-Magnon man who could speak English. Very

advanced for his time, Horace.
And then Horace would wend his
weary way westward in search of
wood. (Actually he never looked
fur wood, but it sounds pretty
; ood that way.) And on the way
he would try to think of things
to do. He never thought of a
thing.
One day he came upon his
friends in a cave several miles
away from the town where

they all lived. They were laughing and talking and
clapping their hands as if a great thing had hap
pened. It had. They had learned to paint on the
walls of the cave with various pigments made out
of rocks and stones and berries. They were paint
ing pictures of animals, men, trees, and things that
they had never seen before so as to fool the archae
ologists who would look at them in later years.
"What in the hell are you doing?" asked Horace
ponderously.
No one answered. They didn't speak English.
"Urripa gimlimpoot filimoptuy?" asked Horace again.
"What do you think we're doing?" they answered.
"vVt-'re painting pictures of animals, men, trees, and
tilings that we have never seen before so as to fool
the archaeologists who will look at them in later
years. What else would we be doing?"
Horace was stunned. He was taken aback. He
scratched his head. He licked his lips. He did the
Mexican Shuffle. He waved his arms. He spat. "A
Bad Thing!" he cried. "A Very Bad Tiling!"
Horace's friends didn't quite know what to think.

Tliey looked at him and asked in unison, "What do
you mean by that, Horace the Intrepid and Fearless
Sabre-toothed Tiger Killer?" (They v/ere speaking
to him formally now.)
"I mean that you are destroying the beauty of
nature and causing yourselves to become vulgar by
allowing yourselves to become immortal," said Hor
ace. "And what's more, immortality is for the
Greeks, Let the world wait for them."
His friends threw rocks at him and told him what
for. "What ior," they said.
"Bah!" said Horace and walked away muttering to
himself and thinking evil thoughts.
The very next day as Horace was wending his
weary way westward in search of water (he actually
didn't look lor water either), he came upon a little
girl sitting on a rock and dreaming of things to come.
In her left hand she was holding a golden hair pin
and in her right hand a silver potty. Horace ap
proached on his knees, wondering what the hell the
world was coming to, anyway. "Little girl," he asked
in wonder, "what in the hell is the world coming to,
anyway? Why are you sitting on that rock thinking
of things to come and holding a golden hairpin in one
hand and a silver potty in the other?"
"I am the spirit of Christmas yet to come," she
answered simply, Hulling out her golden hair and
adjusting her panty-girdle. "1 am here to warn you
of your folly and to tell you of the trouble that can
come to you for being different."
"This sounds strangely like a message in this fable,"
thought Horace. "Tell me, then," he said out loud,
"what is wrong with what I have done and what
trouble can I get into for being different?"
"The ways of the world are hard," she said cryp
tically, "and the ways of man are even harder. There
will be days on end when there will not be a silver
lining and even then it will be blurred by the wind.
So go back to the cave, Horace, and paint on the wall.
Paint the best damned sabre-toothed tiger that the
world has ever seen." She didn't disappear at all alter
thiis, but she did the next best thing: she went to
sleep.
Horace didn't go back to the cave at all. He wound
his weary way further westward in search of women.
The rest of the Cro-Magnon men died. Horace started
a fertility cult. •
