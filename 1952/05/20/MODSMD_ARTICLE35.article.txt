## Chinese—The Best Preparation for Life 
### 
To the Editor:
I am in hearty agreement with Mr. Erikson's letter
of May 16, "Language is obviously a better prepara
tion for life in general than mathematics since there

are more foreigners in the world than mathemati
cians." Following this clear precept, the University
should require compulsory Chinese since there are
more Chinese than any other foreigners.
