# 'Brigadoon' Termed Fresh and Genuine
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
"Brigadoon," on exhibit tonight and through Sunday at the Palo
Alto Community Theater, is indebted both in mood and manner
to Rogers and Hammerstein. Written and scored by Alan Jay
Lerner and Frederick Loewe, the 1947 winner of some two dozen
awards is not a typical musical comedy. Like the great R&H col

laborations, it can more properly be
called a play with song.
The distinction, in such a case,
lies with the book. Served by rath
er than serving the musical num
bers, it carries an individuality of
its own. The songs and dances are
skillfully integrated into the action
for the purpose of advancing the
plot.
As protection against the strife
and turmoil of the outside world,
God lias granted the Scottish vil
lage of Brigitdoon the privilege of
existing for only one day every
hundred years. The bargain,
however, states (hat no resident
may leave Brigadoon after he has
agreed to remain. This proves
complicating when an American
hoy falls in love with a village
girl and when an unhappy lad at
tempts to escape.
Taking for its theme the not ex
actly new idea of love and faith tri
umphant, "Brigadoon" m a n a g e s
nevertheless lo evoke a great deal
of fresh, genuine sentiment. The
charming story and beautiful score
("Waitin' for My Dearie," "The
Heather on the Hill," "Come to Me,
Bend to Me," "Almost Like Being in
Love," "There But for You Co I,"
etc.) blend to provide a moving and
warmly pleasant experience.
The Community Players, well
bolstered by Stanford people, have
drunk deeply of "lirigadoon's"
spirit, and this is communicated

to the audience in such a way as
to obscure most of the minor de
ficiencies their productoin suf
fers. Patricia Edson is a lovely
Fiona, and Dick Burns, the Amer
ican traveler, is properly manful
in his pursuit of her. As his side
kick. Bill Powell proves an expert
at pulling his laughs, while Suzy
Marion keeps pace with her
naughty - hut - nice renditions of
"The Love of My Life" and "My
Mother's Weddin' Day."
Tom Eraser shows himself a fine
tenor, though he might profitably
confine his energies to singing and
modify his actions to some small
extent in his first big number. Along
these lines, there is a young lady in
the chorus whose concepiion oi' how
a little girl should be portrayed
leads to overbearing cuteness; for
tunately it is a running joke in the
play that she is always being
whisked away into the wings.
Joan Hunt has designed and di
rected the dances, and they are
largely effective. Climaxing the first
act, Harry Beaton performs the
Sword Dance, which becomes one
of the evening's high points. The
settings, perhaps, leave something
to be desired in the way of imagi
nation, but Dick Casler's costumes
are as crisp and stylish as usual.

"Brigadoon," on exhibit tonight and through Sunday at the Palo
Alto Community Theater, is indebted both in mood and manner
to Rogers and Hammerstein. Written and scored by Alan Jay
Lerner and Frederick Loewe, the 1947 winner of some two dozen
awards is not a typical musical comedy. Like the great R&H col

laborations, it can more properly be
called a play with song.
The distinction, in such a case,
lies with the book. Served by rath
er than serving the musical num
bers, it carries an individuality of
its own. The songs and dances are
skillfully integrated into the action
for the purpose of advancing the
plot.
As protection against the strife
and turmoil of the outside world,
God lias granted the Scottish vil
lage of Brigitdoon the privilege of
existing for only one day every
hundred years. The bargain,
however, states (hat no resident
may leave Brigadoon after he has
agreed to remain. This proves
complicating when an American
hoy falls in love with a village
girl and when an unhappy lad at
tempts to escape.
Taking for its theme the not ex
actly new idea of love and faith tri
umphant, "Brigadoon" m a n a g e s
nevertheless lo evoke a great deal
of fresh, genuine sentiment. The
charming story and beautiful score
("Waitin' for My Dearie," "The
Heather on the Hill," "Come to Me,
Bend to Me," "Almost Like Being in
Love," "There But for You Co I,"
etc.) blend to provide a moving and
warmly pleasant experience.
The Community Players, well
bolstered by Stanford people, have
drunk deeply of "lirigadoon's"
spirit, and this is communicated

to the audience in such a way as
to obscure most of the minor de
ficiencies their productoin suf
fers. Patricia Edson is a lovely
Fiona, and Dick Burns, the Amer
ican traveler, is properly manful
in his pursuit of her. As his side
kick. Bill Powell proves an expert
at pulling his laughs, while Suzy
Marion keeps pace with her
naughty - hut - nice renditions of
"The Love of My Life" and "My
Mother's Weddin' Day."
Tom Eraser shows himself a fine
tenor, though he might profitably
confine his energies to singing and
modify his actions to some small
extent in his first big number. Along
these lines, there is a young lady in
the chorus whose concepiion oi' how
a little girl should be portrayed
leads to overbearing cuteness; for
tunately it is a running joke in the
play that she is always being
whisked away into the wings.
Joan Hunt has designed and di
rected the dances, and they are
largely effective. Climaxing the first
act, Harry Beaton performs the
Sword Dance, which becomes one
of the evening's high points. The
settings, perhaps, leave something
to be desired in the way of imagi
nation, but Dick Casler's costumes
