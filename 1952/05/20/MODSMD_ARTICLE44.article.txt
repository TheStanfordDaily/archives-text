# Spring Grid Practice Closes is Footballers Look Sharp
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Football, spring style, bowed out in a burst of de-ernphasis last Saturday as Chuck Taylor's boys
ran through a final scrimmage without a crowd, goal posts, or any of the othei trimmings of the
autumn sport.
However, the coaching staff was pleased with the 20-day spring practice, and several football
players who had been hiding their talents last fall blossomed to productiveness this spring.

One of these was sophomore Roy*
Krickeberg, who put in a strong bid
lor the first string defensive middle
guard spot. Krickeberg, considered
Lincoln High School of San Jose's
best all-time lineman, was just an
other jayvee guard last fall. Then,
in spring practice, all his latent po
tential came to the surface.
Another man who has improved
amazingly is freshman linebacker
Manny Vanderlip. As frosh coach
Bob Chilotti says,"He hits like a ton
of bricks, and he is fast on the pass
coverage."
Marsh Howe, first string linebacker
on the '50 frosh team, had a bad
knee last year, but showed a lot of
c avvy. He will figure prominently
in Chuck Taylor's plans next fall.
Three halfbacks have also risen
from oblivion to prominence in next
year's plans. They are Billy Heil
bron, the Hawaiian scooter who
burned up the turf last Saturday;
Jim Stewart, a 160-pound freshman
scatback; and Bill Rogers, a hard
driving half from Fresno. Rogers, a
freshman, was injured most of spring
practice, but he is considered Stan
ford's lop freshman halfback find.
Guards Win Wedge and Len Mayr
hofer (the St. Mary's transfer)
showed a lot, as did JC transfer Ron
Bush. Biish, a 175-pound defensive
end from Yuba JC, began on the
"B" team and knocked everyone
down in sight, then graduated to the
"A" team, and kept on knocking
people down.
Lineups
It's not certain whether the Indians
will adhere to the platoon system or
not, but if they do and if Stanford
had a game tomorrow, Chuck Taylor
would start the following lineup:
Offense . . . Sam Morley and Bill
Storum or John Sternberg, ends; j
Jim Vick and Carter Pyle, tackles;
I .en May rhofer and Norm Mamiu
gian, guards; Dick Steere, Jerry
Goldberg, A 1 Robertson, or Al
thinner, center (this spot poses a
problem); Bob Garrett, quarter
hack; Skip Crist and Hon Cook,
halfbacks; and Boli Mat bias, full
back.
Defense . . . Hon Eadie and Al

Kirland, ends; John Broderick and
Jim Stanton, tackles; Krickeberg,
center guard; Ted Tanner, Chuck
Esseg'ian, and Manny Vunderlip,
linebackers; Mob Thompson, Dave
Casteliucci, and Don Sanders, half
backs.
Sanders is still somewhat of a
question mark. He has to go plus 4
spring quarter and has to make up
17 units summer quarter to play foot
ball. The coaches list him as a ques
tion mark, but Sanders insists that
he'll be out of scholastic difficulty by
next autumn.
Jim Stanton is a name that may
be unfamiliar to many Farm fans.
He was an all-state prep tackle in
Wyoming who blossomed out in
spring practice. As Pete Kmetovic
said, "He's one boy who the coaches
overlooked last fall."
Platoon System Doubtful
Chuck Taylor is right in the midst
of deciding whether or not to use
the platoon system next year. There
is a good possibility that several
players may go both ways. Norm
Manoogian, an All-American can
didate, is the one voted most likely

to go offense and defense. Others
who may play ironmen are Skip Crist
(halfback, fullback, and linebacker),
Chuck Essegian (fullback and line
backer), Ron Eadie, and Bill Rogers.
A prospect that has the coaches

watering at the mouth is versatile
Don Carlson. Carlson said he plans
to go out for football, the only ques
tion mark being his grades. He is
six foot-lour, 215 pounds, and a
trackman. Kmet o vi c remarked,
"Along with Mathias, he's one guy
who could play any position on the
team and play it well."
Sixty gridders will be invited to
come back for pre-season fall prac
tice, beginning September 1.
