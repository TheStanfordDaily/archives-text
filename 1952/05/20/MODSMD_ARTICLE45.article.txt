### 
The crew picture for the 1952 sea
son is shaping up rapidly as the top
college hoats have taken to the
water to prove their ability and
strength.
Last Saturday morning in the
Oakland Estuary Ky Ebright's
powerful California crew outfit
swept three races l'roin highly tout
ed University of Washington repre
sentatives. In doing so, Ky's boats
climbed to the number one position
in rowing circles and have assumed
the favorite's role in the coming
West Coast Spring Championships,

the National Regatta, and the Olym
pic tryouts.
Stanford's orphan crew will take
on Cal, UCLA, USC, Oregon State,
and the University of British Co
lumbia this Saturday morning in
the Newport sprints. Two heats will
be raced in the morning, with the
winner of each competing in the af
ternoon for the 1952 sprint title.
California and Stanford, on the
basis of previous performances, will
be the favorites to meet in the
finale.
At this time the Indian eight will
have a chance to see how they stack
up against the Golden Bears on the
water paths. Coach Bob White is
hoping for a strong showing from
his unheaded squad. Stanford has
rowed to three successive victories
over USC, OSC, and UCLA and has
turned in fine clockings in doing
so, wluch makes the Newport clas
sic more significant in the national
rowing sphere.
Coach White has put together a
boat comprised of top performers
in each winning shell from the
three previous outings. Until this
time, White had sent the boat that
won the warm-up race into com
petition.
