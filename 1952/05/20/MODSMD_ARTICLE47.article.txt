# Biz School Wins Mural One-Hitter
## 
### 
Biz School I captured their fifth
straight intramural victory yester
day, defeating Village .'5OB by a 3-1
count. Dean Daily pitched a near
perfect one-hitter and Rod Saekett
provided the winning margin with
a two-run homer in the first in
ning.
The Biz School speedballer struck
out four, walked three, and held his
opponents scoreless until the last
of the third. Only a first-frame sin
gle to left by Village outfielder Kent
Halawell stood between Daily and
no-hit fame.
John McColl started things off for
the Biz Boys in the top of the first
with a line - drive single to left.
Saekett then brought him around
with his circuit clout deep down
the right field line. McColl singled
again in the third with two on to
account for the third tally.
The Villagers picked up their run
in the third as Hallawell walked,
stole second and third, and scored
on pitcher Jim Mclndoe's ground
out. Melndoe also pitched creditable
ball, allowing but three hits, walk
ing three, and fanning two.
Both teams played errorless hall
in the field.
