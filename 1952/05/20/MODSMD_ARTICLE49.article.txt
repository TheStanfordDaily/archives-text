# Seniors To Oppose SJS In Final Tilt
## 
### 
Baseball Coach Everett Dean has
announced a lineup lor today's San
Jose State game that will include
every senior on the squad but one.
The contest marks the clo.se ol a
ieason that saw them take second
place m league play.
The only senior who will not par
ticipate is Joe Chez, who hurled
against USC on Saturday. The game
will he an anti-climax to tiie pair
the Cards dropped over the week
end to the Trojans, both by out
run margins.
The Spartans have traditionally
given the Indians a run for their
money. It is the third contest be
tween the two squads thsi year,
Stanford taking the initial two, 7-u
and U-4.
Artie Abrahamson will lead off
and play second base. "Art ha.'
played fme ball in the field," Dean
said, "and has managed to hit over
.300." Warren Goodrich, a sopho
more, will play shortstop. Batting
third will be Dave Rosenkrantz, an
other senior.
In the clean-up position, as al
ways, will be Jack Shepard. Al
though only a junior, Shepard will
probably sign a professional con
tract and will also be seen for the
last time today in a Stanford uni
form. Right fielder Owen Powell
will bat fifth. "Owen is a fine com
petitor and a sure outfielder," Dean
commented. "In the Cal and USC
series, he did a better job fielding
against the wind in strange parks
than did the home outfielders."
Hal Skillman will play his last
game in left field. Ray Swarts, an
other sophomore, will see action at
third base. Catcher Dick Corzine
will be in the eighth spot. "Dick is
an excellent receiver," said Dean,
"and reached his high point of the
season by hitting a game-winning
homer off Dick Camilli in the Santa
Clara series."
A group of pitchers may see ac
tion. Dean stated that Bob Mur
phy, Don DeLong, Ken Brown, Phil
Page, Mike Acker, and Rog Osen
baugh may all play. Osenbaugh,
who took the loss in the first Tro
jan contest, will hurl the final two
frames of the season. "Rog and
Chez have been the mainstays of
the Indians' mound staff, and we
would have been lost without their
support this season."
