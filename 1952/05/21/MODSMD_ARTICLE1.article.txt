College boys stampeded "like a
herd of young bulls in the spring
time" in the biggest outbreak of the
current panty raid craze during the
night.
But the coeds were beginning to
fi';ht back.
Where once the girls shrieked in
delight at the forays on their undies,
they now were wielding mops and
golf t'luLs and hurling cosmetic jars.
Tear gas, police squads, shotguns,
and even the National Guard were
needed to bring quiet to the wildest
night since the parity craze seized
the nation's college youth.
Nearly 15,000 students rioted at l.'»
campuses and more than a score
were carted ofl to jail.
Injuries were numerous but few
were serious as the raids struck
Colorado, Northwestern, Minnesota,
Wisconsin, the University of Mis
souri, Stephens and Christian girls'
colleges, the Univeniteis of Ver
mont, Connecticut, Delaware, and
Alabama, Tufts College, and Ore
gon State.
