## Segregation Discussed 
### 
"Is segregation discrimination?"
This was the topic at yesterday's "Y"
lunch-time discussion.
In approaching the subject, two
causes of discrimination were men
tioned—the setting up of minority
groups as scapegoats and the eco
nomic fear of a white population
toward Negroes and Orientals.
Several people in the group ex
pressed the belief that segregation
is essentially the same as discrimi
nation, and that their connection
is not a phenomenon to be found
only in our society. Segregation
implies a qualitative difference in
peoples and must lead to a restric
tion of rights.
Some speakers felt that there is
healthy and unhealthy discrimina
tion. While racc is not a valid basis,
it was argued, there arc others which
legitimately lead to discrimination,
such as the anti-social attitude of
the criminal.
II was pointed out that school ed
ucation is not the whole answer to
Ihc problem of discrimination. Ed
ucation by putting all groups on a
completely equal social status is
(lie only way to destroy the basis
of such discrimination. Until then,
school education is hound to falter
before the very existence of the
problem in our society.
Alberta Stover, who moderated
the discussion, announced that next,
week's topic is "The Citizen's Role
in Public Education." Anyone in
terested in attending should make a
reservation at the "Y" office in the
Women's Clubhouse.
