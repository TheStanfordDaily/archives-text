## Europe's Ills Are Probed 
### HARRY GLAZE 
"Western Europe is seeking to c -
cape from a new sense of impo
tence; its hope lies in the dream of
bringing about a unified Europe."
In ;i talk entitled "Europe: Bat
tleground or Bulwark" Dr. C. Easton
Rothwell explained European re
construction and potentialities to
last night's Tuesday Evening Series
audience in Memorial Auditorium.
(Jiving one of the finest Series
lectures this year. Dr. Rothwell,
director of the Hoover Institute
and Library, told how Europeâ€”a
continent that 35 years ago was
the most powerful in the worl I -
is now lying between two great
forces.
Pinpointing facts, as many speak
ers fail to do, he said that industrial
recovery has taken place quite rap
idly. especially in Germany and
Italy, but the countries are still de
pendent on other parts of the world
"Much of the apparent prosper
ity has an illusorv quality," he
explained. "Dependence on allies
is a distortion of what Europe had
known. There is a mixture of a
semi-war economy and an econ
omy still showing the effects of
the war iust past. Today Europe
literally has no place to go with
its re-established economy."
Dr. Rothwell said that the pres
ent coalitions of .center parties in
most European countries are threat
ened from left and right. Commu
nists and Socialists arc gaining
strength in Germany, for instance,
on the left; and there are still many
favoring a renewal of Nazism.
He explained that in all coun
tries. "Any substantial lowering
of living standards or increase in
social discontent will favor the
extreme groups. Part of the diffi
culty is not only that the coali
tions are unstable, but that they
don't have a clear sense of direc
tion in the way of positive pro
grams."
The United States, in joining
NATO, has for the First time made
a strong commitment with foreign
countries. This fact Dr. Rothwell
emphasized, but he warned that we
must co-operate with them rather
than dictate to build up a strong de
fense force.
