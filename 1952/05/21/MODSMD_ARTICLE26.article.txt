TOKYO, Wednesday, May 21 (UP)—Communist delegates on
tcred the armistice tent at Panmunjon today with new propaganda
weapons provided by the latest prisoner of wai disorders in the
Pusan and Koje Island compounds.
Vice Adni. C. Turner Joy, only two days away from retirement

as Senior United Nations Negotiator,
steeled himself for another hysteri
cal tirade from sharp-tongued North
Korean Gen. Nam 11 as today's ses
sion got underway.
There was little doubt among ob
servers at the truce site that the
Communists would attempt »o use
the new prison riots as further evi -
dence of "ruthless" treatment ac
corded prisoners by the U.N.
Sit Down Strike

disclosed last night that North Ko
rean doctors and attendants in a
Knje hospital waged a sit-down
strike and that American guard;
suppressed a riot in a Ptisan bos
pital camp, killing one Communist

The problem of effectively propa
gandizing these incidents was vir
tually a challenge to North Korean
Gen. Nam 11, who unleashed yes
terday what the U.N. senior dele
gate called his "most vicious, de
grading" propaganda tirade.

ten an<l half months but have no'
heard such vicious, degrading Drop -
aganda as that thrown at us today."
