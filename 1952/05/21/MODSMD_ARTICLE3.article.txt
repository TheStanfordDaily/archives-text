WASHINGTON - Labor Secre
tary Maurice J. Tobin disclosed to
day that he will ask Congress for
special legislation legalizing Presi
dent Truman's seizure of the steel
industry if Ihe Supreme Court rules
against the chief executive.
There seemed small chance Con
gress would grant any such request

Congress and brought some de
mands for his impeachment.
The high court failed to hand
down a decision in the steel case
last Monday, its first "opinion day"
since it took the explosive issue
under advisement a week ago today.
