Cot'iiculimi . . .
Every one of us knows what it is to face a list of
x quired subjects cither in lower division or in a
major field. And probably every one of us rnoantd
a hit, then signed the blue card, and began on the
• abject or list of subjects.
But have you ever asked why? flave you ever tried
to evaluate the significance and ultimate worth of
your curriculum? It's a tough job and too few people
do it.

Another question: who is best
qualified to decide curriculum?
Should it he the business men
who hire college graduates?
Should it be the professors who
h':;<'h ihem? Or is there another
group qualified to speak?
The men of business can make
a contribution to curriculum by
demanding some practical train
ing on the part of the university.
I ''tii■: i: a solid check on the col-

lege'.-; tendency to be too academic, too theoretical.
However, if too much importance were given the
opinion of the employers, college could become little
more than a super-trade school contributing finely
machined specialists, not thinking adults.
Let us examine now the qualifications of the pro
f« '.or:: to decide what a typical undergraduate should
take. As it now stands, this! group does the majority
of the selecting. They are the best qualified for this
difficult task but they need help.
A fundamental difference between most college
students and their professors must be realized. It
i> this: the undergraduates graduate, the teachers
never do. This is not meant as a slight against our
[d»fes: ors but as a genuine consideration. The men
of the academic world do not face the problems
of the outside world. They are the teachers, not
the doers. The doing is left to the graduates.
Therefore, what flaws would be natural for the

professors in deciding curriculum? These would
probably be: a certain amount of impracticality, a
tardiness in keeping up with the times, and an em
phasis on teaching for teachers not teaching for doers.
Is there anyone else who can lend ;i hand in this
difficult business of deciding curriculum? There could
be. What about the students? Everyone seems to
forget about them, even the students themselves.
The undergraduates could make a significant con
tribution toward the solving of this problem. Despite
the paternal, authoritarian opinions, students are
capable of intelligent self direction. Granted, if cur
riculum were strictly a student affair, Stanford might
be a country club of basket weaving and advanced
golf classes. I'm not saying that students should have
all the say. But lltey should have a voice. And they
don't.
Undergraduates—especially the seniors—begin to
understand the pattern of requirements, their good
points and their bad. A thinking senior finds lie
has been wrong in objecting to some course. Hut
in other cases he finds his objections justifiable. It
is this student who could help to make his college
it better college.
The present agencies for the sounding of student
opinion on academic matters do a good job with what
they have. But sadly, these agencies are inadequate
and ineffective. Why? Because the University is not
.sufficiently interested in student opinion. And be
cause the students themselves will not realize their
power. A big chunk of the blame for this is our own.
You are to blame because you do not make your
voice heard. Have you ever considered the tremen
dous power which sleeps within the undergraduate
student body? It is probably the greatest single force
in the University. If you ever stood up and beefed
about something, and beefed loudly, and beefed well,
and made damn sure you were heard, you'd win.
But the student body doesn't or won'tf, and the de
cisions are made for them, and the power and sig
nificant contribution calmly sleeps.
Today we treated generalities, tomorrow specifics—
the foreign language requirement.
