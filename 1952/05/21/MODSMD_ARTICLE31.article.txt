## Condemnation of 'Bigot' Williams' Smear Activities 
### 
To the Editor:
You are certainly to be commended for featuring
an article on the latest output of the California bigot,
Robert 11. Williams. While I am in sympathy with
./hat you say, I believe ii is misleading to treat Wil
liams' activities as merely one adjunct of a political
Mueur campaign.
II is my understanding that he has been jewbaiting
for some years, and his pamphlet "Know Your
Enemy" has achieved wide circulation, not. only in
California but in other parts of the country as well,
la il he "reveals" a Jewish conspiracy to take over
the United States. This new attack on Eisenhower
i: just another gambit to attract to his subscription
lists more incipient paranoids and frustrated older
women, looking lor somebody to hate. That this
business is no joke is indicated, I think, by the fact
that I have had the abcfve-mentioned pamphlet recom
mended to me several times in the last few months,
by people considered very "solid" citizens of their
respective California communities.
California must certainly be proud of this venomous
character, to let his stuff go through the mails and
achieve wide credence, apparently virtually unchal
lenged. When my mid western friends told me I was
coming to the land of fruits and nuts, I didn't want

to believe them, but what is a poor cornfed boy to
think?

I am not a Jew.
