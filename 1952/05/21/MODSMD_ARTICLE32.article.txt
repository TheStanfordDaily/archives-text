# Discredit on the School
## 
### 
To (be Editor:
Today I was a spectator at the parade in honor of
the graduating seniors of the ROTC. What should
h;ive been an inspiring .sight to the spectators where
I was standing was completely overshadowed by a
group of Air ROTC cadets. These cadets, evidently
dismissed from their meeting, were also witnessing
the review. As our country's flag passed before these
cadets, many of whom by now were minus caps and
jackets not one man in ten bothered to render a
salute to the flag. To myself and some other veterans
with whom I was standing words cannot describe
how disgusting such outright disrespect of our na
tion's flag is.
It is too bad that a few men like this bring dis
credit upon their unit and their school.
