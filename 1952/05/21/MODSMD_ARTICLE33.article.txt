"My dear friends:
' fn the time elapsed since my last report to you
1rom Naples, I travelled steadily northward on my
vacation itinerary in the direction of Berlin, visiting
enroute Rome, Florence (where I met John Bush,
Stanford exchange student in Italy), Venice, Milan
Lugano, Geneva (where I spent a few hours talking
with Stonfordites Jane Hayes and Mary Ann Ken
nedy), Luzern, Zurich (where I stayed two days with
one-time ASSU Foreign Scholar Hans Rossi who now
has a fine job in a prominent Swiss bank), Basel,
Freiburg, Stuttgart, and Frankfurt am Main. Despite
the attack of two Soviet fighter planes on an Air
France airliner over Berlin on the same day, I was
:-ble to return safely without interference to Berlin.
"In attempting to summarize a few impressions
fro: i my vacation away from Berlin, let me begin by
emphasizing the pronounced panorama of local dif
1'" races I encountered in < very single nation I visited.
.71. my of these historically-determined cultural idio
syncrasies are, of course, highly subtle, but in general
they color the life and behavior of a region much
move strongly than any such corresponding contrasts
in America. Frequently these traits are the roots of
and long-standing unfriendliness
between sections of a nation. Regardless of the ef
fects of modern transport, radio communication, and
motion picture distribution to all corners of these
k.nd.i, such stork differences continue to exist.
"Secondly, inhabitants of each country express the
conviction that they alone must have the light to

shape their nation's destiny; political coercion or
interference from abroad or from supra-European
governmental authority will not be tolerated. Not
a fervent nationalism, but a feeling that a people's
peculiar cultural and historical development must
permit self-determination even if that policy should
lead to slowly won material achievement or dis
aster. ()it my (tip 112 heard many Europeans and
especially (Jcrmans talk almost unceasingly about
European unity.
"But it unfortunately seems to be true that these
banner-bearers have not thought through the inevi
table implications and practical problems of European
integration. The vast propaganda of this political
movement in Europe seems to have put the common
man in somewhat of a trance, and when the logic and
strength of this trance wears off, many Europeans re
vert to feais and complaints of injury to and loss of
national sovereignty. Idealism is standing threatened
by long-existing national self-determination aspira
tions and the weight of historical traditions.
"Further, the Europeans I met. might be character
ize d broadly as being far more earnest and realistic
with re poet to politics than Americans. They possess
little of the typical American optimism and hope foi
the future, for in the recent past tlfey have suffered
directly and terribly from results of misuse of political
power, and moreover feel closely threatened today
by their proximity to the Soviet Union. Although a
majority believe another war will come, they are too
burdened with weariness and financial privation to
the point where no enthusiasm or hysteria can be
incited toward building atomic bomb defenses or
similar war preparations."

"My dear friends:
' fn the time elapsed since my last report to you
1rom Naples, I travelled steadily northward on my
vacation itinerary in the direction of Berlin, visiting
enroute Rome, Florence (where I met John Bush,
Stanford exchange student in Italy), Venice, Milan
Lugano, Geneva (where I spent a few hours talking
with Stonfordites Jane Hayes and Mary Ann Ken
nedy), Luzern, Zurich (where I stayed two days with
one-time ASSU Foreign Scholar Hans Rossi who now
has a fine job in a prominent Swiss bank), Basel,
Freiburg, Stuttgart, and Frankfurt am Main. Despite
the attack of two Soviet fighter planes on an Air
France airliner over Berlin on the same day, I was
:-ble to return safely without interference to Berlin.
"In attempting to summarize a few impressions
fro: i my vacation away from Berlin, let me begin by
emphasizing the pronounced panorama of local dif
1'" races I encountered in < very single nation I visited.
.71. my of these historically-determined cultural idio
syncrasies are, of course, highly subtle, but in general
they color the life and behavior of a region much
move strongly than any such corresponding contrasts
in America. Frequently these traits are the roots of
and long-standing unfriendliness
between sections of a nation. Regardless of the ef
fects of modern transport, radio communication, and
motion picture distribution to all corners of these
k.nd.i, such stork differences continue to exist.
"Secondly, inhabitants of each country express the
conviction that they alone must have the light to

shape their nation's destiny; political coercion or
interference from abroad or from supra-European
governmental authority will not be tolerated. Not
a fervent nationalism, but a feeling that a people's
peculiar cultural and historical development must
permit self-determination even if that policy should
lead to slowly won material achievement or dis
aster. ()it my (tip 112 heard many Europeans and
especially (Jcrmans talk almost unceasingly about
European unity.
"But it unfortunately seems to be true that these
banner-bearers have not thought through the inevi
table implications and practical problems of European
integration. The vast propaganda of this political
movement in Europe seems to have put the common
man in somewhat of a trance, and when the logic and
strength of this trance wears off, many Europeans re
vert to feais and complaints of injury to and loss of
national sovereignty. Idealism is standing threatened
by long-existing national self-determination aspira
tions and the weight of historical traditions.
"Further, the Europeans I met. might be character
ize d broadly as being far more earnest and realistic
with re poet to politics than Americans. They possess
little of the typical American optimism and hope foi
the future, for in the recent past tlfey have suffered
directly and terribly from results of misuse of political
power, and moreover feel closely threatened today
by their proximity to the Soviet Union. Although a
