## Punts and Pitches Olympics, Watch Out for Stanford 
### 
In 1920, Stanford sent more entrants to the Olympic Games (held at
Antwerp) than any other university in the world.
In 1952, history may repeat itself.
Twenty athletes who are now wearing Stanford colors or who once
wore them have a chance to be at Helsinki this summer.
Heading the list, of course, is Robert Bruce Mathias, the doctor's son
fi'prn Tulare. Although the new point system will handicap Mathias, he

has improved vastly since he won
the Olympic title at 17. Actually,
some of his toughest competition will
come from his own country . . . with
Billy Albans and the Reverend Rob
ert Richards breathing fire down
Mathias's nock. However, Dink
Templeton told me last night, "I
think Bob stands head and shoulders
above the rest of the world in the
decathalon, and if he can cure his
jerk in the discus, he has a good
chance to qualify in that event."
Next to Mathias, the Stanfnrdite
who has the best chance to take
one or more firsts is Sharon fleary,
the long-limbed swim star from
Long Beach. Sharon, a soph, placed
first in the Pan American games
last year, and is national women's
100 meters champion. She could

easily pick up a second gold medal as a member of the winning relay
team. Incidentally, she is only five-tenths of a second oft' the world's
record.
The Farm has two javelin possibilities. One is Bud Held, who tossed
the spear 249 feet 8V2 inches last year, 7 1 // inches better than anyone else
in the world could do it last season. Held, however, has a bad shoulder
and is having difficulty getting into shape. The other javelin hopeful is
Leo Long, the sophomore transfer from Modesto JC and the only married
man on the track team.
Otis Chandler, on the '50 track team and now in the army, is rated the
second best shot-putter in the world. His tops is 57 feet, 4% inches.
Irori-man Gay Bryan has won the national hop, step, and jump title
four years in a row and will try to make to Olympics in that event and
the broad jump.
Two foreign students at Stanford have already made their respective
Olympic teamÂ®. Ian Reed holds the British Commonwealth javelin record
at 102 feet 8 ;i /4 inches and will compete for Australia. Eighteen-year-old
Carlos Bea is in the process of making the Cuban Olympic team in basket
ball.
Two Indian water poloists are almost cinches to go. The water polo
squad that wins the national title is the team that goes to Helsinki. And
IJiib Froien and Harry Borehers are members of the Whiltier Swim Club,
which has won the title two years in a row anil which is heavily favored
to repeat this season.
Coach Tom Haynie thinks that 200 yard free stylers Pete Cole and Bobby
Thompson and frosh backstroker Larry Heim have excellent chances of
F.oing to Finland. Bill Glathe has an outside chance in the platform dive.
Also a dark horse is freshman Bob Reed in the 5,000 meters.
As Jim Madison put in his column, Dan Elliot and Paul Merrill are
entering the Olympic tryouts in yachting. The Cards only have an outside
chance in crew, but three Stanford crewsmen might represent the United
States in the pair-oared shell. Dewey Ilecht and Jim Filer would be on
the oars and Jim Beggs, Stanford coach last year, the coxsv/ain. The trio's
main competition will come from Princeton and Navy, but the Stanfordites
have a several month jump in training because of the weather.
Yes, when the American (lag is raised at Helsinki and the Star Spangled
Banner plays, more than once the United States representatives 011 the
winner's platform may be from Stanford.
