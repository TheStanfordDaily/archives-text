# SENIORS END COLLEGE CAREERS
## Indian Nine Ends Season With Loss to San Jose 
### MIKE HUDSON 
Stanford ended its season with a
lull as San Jose State's baseballers
pounded out a 9-4 win yesterday
in the Sunken Diamond. San Jore
was held to eight hits by a bevy of
Card hurlers, but 14 Spartan walks
added to the slaughter.
San Jose opened up with two
runs in the first off starter Bob
Murphy. Murph was troubled by a
sore arm, so Don De Long took
over. He was tight with hits, but
his lack of control brought three
more Spartans home in the second.
Next Ken Brown tried his luck, and
he was tagged for four runs in six
frames.
Stanford, meanwhile, was trying
to solve the offerings of Stater
Claire Parkin. Parkin pitched
three-hit ball for five innings, but
in the sixth, Owen Powell homered
inside the park to deep left-center,
with Hal Skillman scoring ahead of
him. Two more Cards .scored in the
seventh, when Brown and Art
Abrahamson lashed out clean hits
and an error at third base brought
them home.
Mike Acker hurled the ninth in
ning for the Cards.
The following men played their
last game in a Stanford uniform:
Dick Corzine, Art Abrahamson.
Dave Rosenkrantz, llul Skillman, and
Owen Powell. Pitchers Jos Chez
and Rog Osenbaugh finished their
careers last weekend. In addition,
Jack Shepard may have ended his
Card swinging, as rumors are flying
of his imminent signing up by a pro
fessional team.
