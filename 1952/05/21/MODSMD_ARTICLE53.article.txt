# And in the Majors

### LARRY CAHN 
While Cleveland is away and
winging in the American League
i (lag chase, the National loop is
| tighter than grandpappy on Satur
! day night.
The Indians have built up a Ix->-1 x ->-
game lead in the American on the
strength of their batting and have
not yet gotten the most out of their
pitching staff. Hurlers Lemon, Fel
ler, Garcia, and Wynn have won
their share but have dropped more
than expected. When they hit their
stride, if they do, Cleveland will be
very hard to whip.
Washington is tied with Koston
for secimd spo(. Boston's surpe
j lacks good reason or cause. The
j Red Sox are not hitting well and
their defensive play has been
poor. The Senators are not hit
ling well, and the Capital City
nine lias not met the toughest op
position in the circuit and the test
is still ahead.
New York and St. Louis have
each gained a bit of ground over the
past week. Both clubs are dead
! locked four games ofl the pace. But
| catching Cleveland is going to take
I a lot of doing.
Outstanding in the American
| League this past week was the no

hitter turned in by Detroit's Virgil
Trucks.
In the National League race,
Brooklyn and New York are again
all knotted up for league leader
ship. E?oth clubs have won 19 while
dropping seven. Phil Cavarretta's
Cubs are 4'/j games out and fad
ing fast.
The (Hants, with a seven and
naivjht win record by Maglie and
a three and It by Jansen have the
pitching edge. However the Iludg
ers are hitting well, not as a team
l>ut through individual perform
ances of Jackie liobitisnn, Duke
Snider, and Billy Cox. Others will
have to start hitting for continued
Brooklyn success.
And the Dodders also have the
hulling. Biily Loes, back from the
service, and Preacher Hoe have fo 11
wins, no losses. So it still looks like
an awfully tight September race
between the cro.stown rivals.
Chicago's Hank Sauer and Frank
Baumholtz are clubbing the ball at
well over the .30U clip. Sauer i;i six
out in front of both leagues in runs
batted in with 34. But Chicago
lacks consistent hitting and strong
pitching to be a serious threat to
Naional League supremacy.

Lloyd Merriman's departure
from baseball was overshadow'd
by that of Coleman and Williams.
However, the former Stanford
fullback, who left school to pi. \
the outfield for Cincinnati, has re
ported to 111 Toro to start hi. Ma
rine combat flight training.
In top action this week, Cincin
nati, still not. out of it, meets Brook
lyn, and New York meets the ('.ml;
in the National League. While in
the junior circuit, Cleveland enter -
tains Boston and then travel. 1 to St.
Louis, the Yankei . u.n.nl" villi li'
ton, an 1 the Senators |<laj St. I.oui.
and Philadelphia.
