# Visiting Scot Clergyman Tells Importance of Campus Chapels
## 
### SALLY SHALER 
"St. Andrew's University is
the oldest university in Scot
land, you know — we're very
proud of that," said Dr. Donald
Baillie, eminent theologian, in
his delightful Scotch accent be
tween sips of coffee at an in
formal get-together in the YW
CA Monday night.
Dr. Bail lie, professor of systematic
theology at St. Andrew's University
in Scotland, is visiting the states to
teach at the San Francisco Theologi
cal Seminary in San Anselmo, and
as a friend of Rev. Minto's has been

spending the past few days at Stan- I
ford. He has spoken informally at
several meetings on campus.
When asked about student Chris
tian activities in Scotch and British
universities, Dr. Baillie explained
that "older universities like St.
Andrew's (founded in 1411), have
chapels which play an important role
in the life of the student with morn
ing prayers and Sunday services.
Cut the modern universities do not
have their own chapels."
Student Christian Move
He said, "another aspect of the
student Christian activities on Brit
ish campuses is the Student Christian
Movement of Great Britain and Ire
land." The SCM is similar to our |
YMCA and YWCA. The SCM is co
educational and is part of the World
Student Christian Federation.
The SCM, like our "Y," has open
meetings. There is an annual con
ference in July, called ''Swanic" at a
permanent conference area. The
Conference is attended by students
from all over the British Isles with
visitors from the Continent and the
United States.
Promotes Understanding
The greying Scotsman said the
SCM has lead the way for the past
45 or 50 years for the present ecu
menical movement. The SCM is in
terdenominational and promotes un
derstanding between the denomina
tions. It also teaches Christian politi- '

cal and social responsibilities, the
pleasant Scottish theological! ex
plained.
In the SCM, and among university
students in general, an interest in
Bible study lias developed. This
study is extremely intensive, a group
often spending a whole semester on
a single book of the Bible, Dr. Bail
lie said.
Among British students there is a
great deal of discussion of the rela
tionship between Christianity and
education, Dr. Baillie said. There is
a definite trend toward the practical
application of Christianity in terms
to college life.
Preparation for Profession
Dr. Baillie remarked that in Brit
ish universities, the students arc only
those men and women who are pre
paring for a strictly professional ca
reer.
Discussing courses in religion in
British universities, Dr. Baillie said
that in old universities there is al
ways a Faculty of Theology at the
graduate level only. In new uni
versities courses in religion arc given
at the undergraduate level.
