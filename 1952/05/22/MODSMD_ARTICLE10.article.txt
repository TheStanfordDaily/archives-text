# Custodian to Be Honored
## 
### JIM MADISON 
A man who has devoled 38
years of servicc to Stanford will
ho honored tonight, when the
chemistry department staff holds
a testimonial dinner for Walter
Johnson Bruce, custodian of the j
department.
Bruce began his duties as cus
todian on the first of June, 19M. |
Neat, gray, and still firm and erect I
at (iS, he will retire September 1 of '
this year.
As custodian. Bruce has been rc- j
sponsible for the ordering and care j
of supplies and equipment for the j
chemistry department When he first ,
started work, the department was
still dependent for most of its sup
plies on (iermany.
At. that time there was no Panama i
Canal, and the supplies had to be j
shipped around Cape Horn.
Shortly thereafter, however,
World War I cut off (iermany as a
HHirce, and the department had to
find sources for its needs in the
United States. Bruce recalls the
development of the American
chemical supply industry over the
years, and how he has gradually
built up the department's stock.
Now he can supply the required
material for almost any chemical
pro jc*'l e\cept special research
from the department s broad in
ventory.
Measuring his words carefully be- j
fore he speaks in a clear, mild voice
Bruce says: "Oh yes. there've been !
lot . of interesting people around i
here, and lots of interesting things |
have happened, but no special stories
I'd like to tell for publication."
'I he impression that his rccollec- j
lions are of private friends among l
the professors and students and not |
public figures is accentuated when
he continues: "Many students, chil- j
drcn of students in the department
when i first came, have come through |
my office.
"Stanford students today, though. I
are just as much gentlemen as they j

used to he. And increasing the num
ber of women from the first fabled
500 has been a good improvement."
Before becoming custodian, Bruce
bad taken a business institute edu
cation in the midwest and also
worked on the reconstruction of
Stanford campus after the earth
quake.
He is married, and his only son
teaches high school in Los Angeles.
As to his plans for his retire

ii cnl. he lights up: "I've always
enjoyed hunting, fishing, and
(raveling in the mountains; and
now there'll he more time for that."
Professor of Chemistry Emeritus
Robert E. Swain, one of only two
men in the chemistry department
when Bruce first came to Stanford,
will be the speaker tonight. John P.
Mitchell, Registrar and Professor
Emeritus, is the only other living
member of that stuff.
