## Sen. Russell's 'Strategy of Platitude' 
### 
Senator Richard Russell, Southern Demo
r. ratio candidate lor the presidency, who ro
( ently passed through San Francisco, demon
tod there the platitudinous appeal that has
characterized his entire pre-convention cam
paign.
References to "the great commonwealth of
California" and the "unigue atmosphere of San
Francisco," are the stock and trade of cam
paigners and always have been. Russell carries
thr? aproach almost to the ridiculous.
His generalities, his glittering phrases often
y nothing. At times, they are openly con
tradictory. Russell's type of campaign, we feel,
doesn't give the voter a square shake.
Consider this set of Russell policies expressed
in his address before the San Francisco Com
monwealth Club: Balance the budget, increase
defense spending, maintain the domestic legis
lation of the New Deal with its consequent ex
penditures, cut taxes.
JI these proposals are not contradictory, they
c.ro certainly not mutually complementary. His
proposals constitute a difficult project. And
Rumsoll never goes beyond the fine sounding
phrase-, to explain how it is to be accomplished.
