# Ike's 'Silent' Strategy
## 
### 
Much as we deplore Russell's "strategy of
platitude," we think Eisenhower's pre-conven
tion approach, the "strategy of the closed
mouth" does a greater injustice to the American

voler. Ike's recent reiteration that he will do
110 campaigning is unfortunate from the stand
point of the voter in the primaries who is will
ing to give Ike a chance, but doesn't want to
vote blind.
Unfortunately, this type of voter may not be
strong enough to stop Ike. His obvious strategy
and that of most of his backers is that the silent
treatment will be politically most effective and
land him the nomination.
From a democratic point of view, the point
of view of letting the people choose, Ike cer
tainly doesn't make the choice any easier.
