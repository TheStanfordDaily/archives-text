# Anti-Ike Smears
## 
### 
Ike's silence does nothing to stem the vicious
anti-Ike'smear campaign launched recently (re
ported in Monday's Daily). The smears, based
more on personality and superficialities than
on policy, v/ould appear ridiculous if matched
with Ike's views, wore his views more generally
known.
You can't laugh the smear campaign off. The
ruthless lies, distortions, and half-truths distrib
uted by so-called "Intelligence" reports are
being swallowed to an alarming extent. This
is the report from Dean of Students Donald Win
bigler, recently returned from Chicago, and of
Dr. Chilton R. Bush, head of Stanford's Institute
for lournalistic Studies, who found some Stan
ford graduates in the Los Angeles area accept
ing Nazi-like, anti-Ike smears.
