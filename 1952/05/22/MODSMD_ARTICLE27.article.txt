## Foreign Language Requirement 
### DICK McLEAN 
"What man is there of you who if his son ask
l>read, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a
fish will he give him a serpent?"— Matthew 7: !)-!(>.

Last fall the foreign language requirement got itself
a thorough airing. A lot of words were written pro
and eon, a lot of people argued about it. Action was
demanded and promises of reform exacted.
'J he action came from the Academic Council last
Thursday. But the reform? It took the disguise of
1) a reduction of units and 2) the choice of a lan
guage or a ral't of high powered mathematics that
only an engineer can engineer. The three reduced

units rendered the language re
quirement literally dumb by
stripping it of conversation and
pronunciation. It's a real bargain.
You get more quarters of it (six
instead of five), just as much
work, less units for the work, less
utility for the effort.
A, for this mathematics option,
who's trying to kid whom? It's
called an option. Yeah, just like
having your choice of death by

hanging or death by drowning. It is designed for
one purpose essentially and that is to better de
termine what is an engineer. They are the only
group who can really use it. But this is nothing new,
however, since engineers have been exempt from
th* language requirement for a year.
Hut why have engineers been freed from the
principle of "Every man shall have at least a second
yt .»r knowledge of some foreign language?" Do
engineers make a greater contribution to society
than a political science major? (".ranted we need
men to build our bridges and our weapons of war,
bul we also need men who can vote intelligently
and control the forces that dictate the use*>f these
arms. The reason for the engineer's privilege is one
<.(' simple expediency. The University is trying to
gel them through their training in four years instead
of five.
But what about the rest of us? College is only four
years long lor most of the student body. The stress
».t finances and the pressure of military service place
graduate study at a premium. In short, we are work
in;' against a deadline which is just as stiff as that of
the engineers.
Where is your principle now? Expediency has de
stroyed the tottering, archaic principle on whieh the

university wide foreign language requirement has
long perched.
But let us pursue this theme of expediency a hit
farther. I would he foolish to deny the value of a
foreign language. Language has many fine ad
vantages such as an understanding of another people
and their literature. This is all well and good hut is
it expedient to pay a price of 10 per cent of our
entire college curriculum t:» obtain it? When you're
a senior with only a few quarters left, do you realize
that college is like visiting a supermarket with
only a few dollars? You've got to shop carefully
and even still you leave too much on the counter.
Is it expedient to force a blanket requirement on
an unwilling student body in the guise of "liberal
education" when in actuality liberal education is
stifled by this unit-glutton who restricts our time for
elective units?
Is it expedient to wait and see what the new "re
form" will do? How are departments rebuilt? They
are rebuilt with better teachers and better facilities.
And how do you get these? You buy them. The
University was operated at a deficit of $(52,770 last
year.
As for this thing about "patience," let me draw
an analogy. The university-wide requirement is like
unto an old horse who's served its function on the
farm and is nov.' sick. It should be shot but a new
veterinarian arrives and begins to curry its coat. The"
old horse may look better but it's still the same bag
of bones underneath. End of analogy.
You mght well ask, "If the case is so clearly made,
why has nothing been done?" The answer is that
change is always slow and undergraduates are
naturally apathetic. Change is slow because faculty
politics make it such. The clearest statement of
student apathy that I've heard went something like,
"Why should I worry ahout the foreign language
requirement? I'm already through with the damn
thing."
So what can bo done? Who can do it?
You can rid yourselves of the foreign language
requirement if yon really want to. But really want
ing means that you've got to care and you've got to
work. You've got to realize your own power and
channel it well. You've got to make use of your
Student Faculty Education Committee (Box 2135,
Stanford), you've got to buttonhole professors and
make your views known. And probably you'll have
to write, organize, and circulate a petition.
But if you stand up and beef about something, and
beef loudly, and beef well, and make damn sure
you're heard, you'll win.

stifled by this unit-glutton who restricts our time for
elective units?
Is it expedient to wait and see what the new "re
form" will do? How are departments rebuilt? They
are rebuilt with better teachers and better facilities.
And how do you get these? You buy them. The
University was operated at a deficit of $(52,770 last
year.
As for this thing about "patience," let me draw
an analogy. The university-wide requirement is like
unto an old horse who's served its function on the
farm and is nov.' sick. It should be shot but a new
veterinarian arrives and begins to curry its coat. The"
old horse may look better but it's still the same bag
of bones underneath. End of analogy.
You mght well ask, "If the case is so clearly made,
why has nothing been done?" The answer is that
change is always slow and undergraduates are
naturally apathetic. Change is slow because faculty
politics make it such. The clearest statement of
student apathy that I've heard went something like,
"Why should I worry ahout the foreign language
requirement? I'm already through with the damn
thing."
So what can bo done? Who can do it?
You can rid yourselves of the foreign language
requirement if yon really want to. But really want
ing means that you've got to care and you've got to
work. You've got to realize your own power and
channel it well. You've got to make use of your
Student Faculty Education Committee (Box 2135,
Stanford), you've got to buttonhole professors and
make your views known. And probably you'll have
to write, organize, and circulate a petition.
But if you stand up and beef about something, and
beef loudly, and beef well, and make damn sure
you're heard, you'll win.

Last fall the foreign language requirement got itself
a thorough airing. A lot of words were written pro
and eon, a lot of people argued about it. Action was
demanded and promises of reform exacted.
'J he action came from the Academic Council last
Thursday. But the reform? It took the disguise of
1) a reduction of units and 2) the choice of a lan
guage or a ral't of high powered mathematics that
only an engineer can engineer. The three reduced

units rendered the language re
quirement literally dumb by
stripping it of conversation and
pronunciation. It's a real bargain.
You get more quarters of it (six
instead of five), just as much
work, less units for the work, less
utility for the effort.
A, for this mathematics option,
who's trying to kid whom? It's
called an option. Yeah, just like
having your choice of death by

hanging or death by drowning. It is designed for
one purpose essentially and that is to better de
termine what is an engineer. They are the only
group who can really use it. But this is nothing new,
however, since engineers have been exempt from
th* language requirement for a year.
Hut why have engineers been freed from the
principle of "Every man shall have at least a second
yt .»r knowledge of some foreign language?" Do
engineers make a greater contribution to society
than a political science major? (".ranted we need
men to build our bridges and our weapons of war,

the engineers.
Where is your principle now? Expediency has de
stroyed the tottering, archaic principle on whieh the

university wide foreign language requirement has
long perched.
But let us pursue this theme of expediency a hit
farther. I would he foolish to deny the value of a
foreign language. Language has many fine ad
vantages such as an understanding of another people
and their literature. This is all well and good hut is
it expedient to pay a price of 10 per cent of our

group who can really use it. But this is nothing new,
however, since engineers have been exempt from
th* language requirement for a year.
Hut why have engineers been freed from the
principle of "Every man shall have at least a second
yt .»r knowledge of some foreign language?" Do
engineers make a greater contribution to society
than a political science major? (".ranted we need
men to build our bridges and our weapons of war,
bul we also need men who can vote intelligently
and control the forces that dictate the use*>f these
arms. The reason for the engineer's privilege is one
<.(' simple expediency. The University is trying to
gel them through their training in four years instead
of five.
But what about the rest of us? College is only four
years long lor most of the student body. The stress
».t finances and the pressure of military service place
graduate study at a premium. In short, we are work
in;' against a deadline which is just as stiff as that of
the engineers.
Where is your principle now? Expediency has de
stroyed the tottering, archaic principle on whieh the

university wide foreign language requirement has
long perched.
But let us pursue this theme of expediency a hit
farther. I would he foolish to deny the value of a
foreign language. Language has many fine ad
vantages such as an understanding of another people
and their literature. This is all well and good hut is
it expedient to pay a price of 10 per cent of our
entire college curriculum t:» obtain it? When you're
a senior with only a few quarters left, do you realize
that college is like visiting a supermarket with
only a few dollars? You've got to shop carefully
and even still you leave too much on the counter.
Is it expedient to force a blanket requirement on
an unwilling student body in the guise of "liberal
education" when in actuality liberal education is
stifled by this unit-glutton who restricts our time for
elective units?
Is it expedient to wait and see what the new "re
form" will do? How are departments rebuilt? They
are rebuilt with better teachers and better facilities.
And how do you get these? You buy them. The
University was operated at a deficit of $(52,770 last
year.
As for this thing about "patience," let me draw
an analogy. The university-wide requirement is like
unto an old horse who's served its function on the
farm and is nov.' sick. It should be shot but a new
veterinarian arrives and begins to curry its coat. The"
old horse may look better but it's still the same bag
of bones underneath. End of analogy.
You mght well ask, "If the case is so clearly made,
why has nothing been done?" The answer is that
change is always slow and undergraduates are
naturally apathetic. Change is slow because faculty
politics make it such. The clearest statement of
student apathy that I've heard went something like,
"Why should I worry ahout the foreign language
requirement? I'm already through with the damn
thing."
So what can bo done? Who can do it?
You can rid yourselves of the foreign language
requirement if yon really want to. But really want
ing means that you've got to care and you've got to
work. You've got to realize your own power and
channel it well. You've got to make use of your
Student Faculty Education Committee (Box 2135,
Stanford), you've got to buttonhole professors and
make your views known. And probably you'll have
to write, organize, and circulate a petition.
But if you stand up and beef about something, and
beef loudly, and beef well, and make damn sure
you're heard, you'll win.

l>read, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a

Last fall the foreign language requirement got itself
a thorough airing. A lot of words were written pro
and eon, a lot of people argued about it. Action was
demanded and promises of reform exacted.
'J he action came from the Academic Council last
Thursday. But the reform? It took the disguise of
1) a reduction of units and 2) the choice of a lan
guage or a ral't of high powered mathematics that
only an engineer can engineer. The three reduced

units rendered the language re
quirement literally dumb by
stripping it of conversation and
pronunciation. It's a real bargain.
You get more quarters of it (six
instead of five), just as much
work, less units for the work, less
utility for the effort.
A, for this mathematics option,
who's trying to kid whom? It's
called an option. Yeah, just like
having your choice of death by

hanging or death by drowning. It is designed for
one purpose essentially and that is to better de
termine what is an engineer. They are the only
group who can really use it. But this is nothing new,
