# Alpiners Try Yosemite Peaks
## 
### RUTH JAHNKE 
Difficult, spectacular, but sale
are the adjectives used by Al
pine Club rock climbers in de
scribing their weekend trips to
Yosemite. The area rates highly
with climbers, since there is no
dangar from storms and the
j rock is hard, smooth granite.
Climbs in Yosemite are as difii
! cult as any in North America, in
I the opinion of well-traveled Al-
I piner.s. Ihoy have to use 120 feet
j of rope between climbers, and the
| holes are inconveniently few and
I tar between. Climbing i.s possible
j only with the liberal use of pitons,
iion spike:; that can be hammered
j into small cracks and fissures in
j an otherwise unscalable rock face.
Ledges, holes, and other rest spots
! are separated by long, hard hauls.
! The climbs are frequently described
!as being "from bush to bush,"
j because scraggly little trees and
I bushes are found in all improbable
places, especially the tops of spires.
"Bathtub" Support
The "bathtub" that is supporting
the climber in the picture was so
named by a cynical rock - scaler
many years ago. The hole in the
face is actually less than a foot in
diameter, but the climb couldn't be
made without it.
In lock climbing of the caliber
done in Yosemite, the emphasis if
placed on balance, rhythm, and fric
tion. The importance of balance
and rhythm is fairly obvious, espe
! cially as they are involved with
muscular co-ordination. Friction ic
indispensable, particularly between
i piton and rock, rope and pi ton, and
climber and rock.
Descents Easier
Descents are usually accom
i plished by walking down the gentle
I slope on the other side of the rock
that has been climbed, but in Yo-
I Semite it's the easy side that the
j climbers struggle up.
The technique of rapel]ing is used
by Alpiners when returning to the
ground from the land of space and
j granite. This involves the use of
' two ropes, with the climber sliding
j down slowly, bracing himself
! aaginst the lace he has so labori
j ously ascended.
Dillicult, spectacular, but safe . . .
difficult and spectacular, anyway.
Such experiences fascinate the Al
piners, drawing them back to the
rocks of Yosemite weekend after
weekend.

"Bathtub" Support
The "bathtub" that is supporting
the climber in the picture was so
named by a cynical rock - scaler
many years ago. The hole in the
face is actually less than a foot in
diameter, but the climb couldn't be
made without it.
In lock climbing of the caliber
done in Yosemite, the emphasis if
placed on balance, rhythm, and fric
tion. The importance of balance
and rhythm is fairly obvious, espe

muscular co-ordination. Friction ic
indispensable, particularly between
i piton and rock, rope and pi ton, and
climber and rock.
Descents Easier
Descents are usually accom
i plished by walking down the gentle
I slope on the other side of the rock
that has been climbed, but in Yo-
I Semite it's the easy side that the
j climbers struggle up.

Such experiences fascinate the Al

HANGING IN A BATHTUB—RoIand Tabor, next year's presi

Higher Spire in Yosemite.
Difficult, spectacular, but sale
are the adjectives used by Al

scribing their weekend trips to
Yosemite. The area rates highly
with climbers, since there is no

Climbs in Yosemite are as difii

I the opinion of well-traveled Al-

j of rope between climbers, and the

j only with the liberal use of pitons,
