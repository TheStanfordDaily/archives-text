Ia):j i ble.
Ho far, Indian Varsity and Jayvee teams have competed in 11!) dual
evenis. They haw won 107, tied one, and dropped 31. That's winning at a
77 i>*. r i pti» f• 1 it>. Not bad in any league, and there are few schools in the

country that can match that high percentage. Against
our friends from across the Bay, the Indians have
walked off with 14 of 17 events.
The best record, obviously, has been chalked up
by Tom Haynie's amazing mermen. The Varsity
splashers have yet to lose a dual meet. Today, to
morrow, and Saturday the Cards should add the I'CC
crown to their bulging victory belt in rather spectacu
lar fashion. Over vacation, the Ilayniemen took fifth
place in the NCAA races held al Princeton. The Var
sity has won 11 and lost none. The Jayvee;; have won
seven, losing once to the Cal Cubs.
The Indians also rule supreme in golf. Besides
winning ten Varsity matches and dropping two, the

wild-blasters captured the Northern California Intercollegiates and the
I'CC titles. One remaining obstacle is the NCAA finals at Purdue iti late
June. The Indians will he second favorites behind powerful North Texas
State.
The two losses were to a star-studded Olympic Club squad and to San
Jose Stale, who later were defeated in a second match with the Cards. The
Jayvee golfers are undefeated alter eight matches.
Although playing second liddle to the USC Trojans, Stanford fielded
a surprisingly strong track squad in what was supposed to he a lean year.
Three newcomers who came through in tremendous fashion gave the team
some unexpected balance. The three—Leo Long, Howie Hertz, and Boh
Heed.
The Varsity won seven dual meets and lost only to Troy. Track filberts
tab the Card thinclads as one of the top five dual track teams in the nation.
Coach Jack Weiershauser should pull out enough points for second in the
I'CC finals this weekend and could conceivably garner two or three or four
i/i the nationals over at Berkeley. The Jayvees competed in eight dual
meets and only lost one and that was because of a, dropped baton against
Sacramento J.C.
Until the last two-game series with SC, the Indian hasehallers were in
the CIBA pennant race. They ended up in second spot and posted a 20-
N record for the overall season. The Junior Varsity even did better.
'I hey won their last 13 games and compiled a 15 and 5 record.
On the courts the Indian netters, although not champs, are still having
one of their best post-war seasons. The Cards dropped SC twice, which
marked the end of a long era of Trojan domination over Stanford. The
Cauls stand with a 9-6 record and have one match with Cal left. The juniors
have taken four matches, losing one.
Undefeated after three races each, the Varsity and Jayvee crews will
stand among the tops in the nation. SC, UCLA, and Oregon State have
been outrowcd, but the strokers have yet to face Cal and Washington.
To finish off the Spring Sports picture, the Card fencers are also un
defeated. They beat Cal and won the Northern California open meet.
In summary it looks like two PCC championships, a possible crew title,
runnerups in baseball and track, tops in Bay Area fencing, and a good
record by Bob Renker's net squad. That's a fairly nice picture. Anyhow,
it's our nominee for tops in Stanford's Spring Sports history.

This still may be a little premature what with so many important events

winning ten Varsity matches and dropping two, the

wild-blasters captured the Northern California Intercollegiates and the
I'CC titles. One remaining obstacle is the NCAA finals at Purdue iti late

State.
The two losses were to a star-studded Olympic Club squad and to San
Jose Stale, who later were defeated in a second match with the Cards. The
Jayvee golfers are undefeated alter eight matches.
Although playing second liddle to the USC Trojans, Stanford fielded
a surprisingly strong track squad in what was supposed to he a lean year.
Three newcomers who came through in tremendous fashion gave the team
some unexpected balance. The three—Leo Long, Howie Hertz, and Boh
Heed.
The Varsity won seven dual meets and lost only to Troy. Track filberts
tab the Card thinclads as one of the top five dual track teams in the nation.
Coach Jack Weiershauser should pull out enough points for second in the
I'CC finals this weekend and could conceivably garner two or three or four
i/i the nationals over at Berkeley. The Jayvees competed in eight dual
meets and only lost one and that was because of a, dropped baton against
Sacramento J.C.
Until the last two-game series with SC, the Indian hasehallers were in
the CIBA pennant race. They ended up in second spot and posted a 20-
N record for the overall season. The Junior Varsity even did better.
'I hey won their last 13 games and compiled a 15 and 5 record.
On the courts the Indian netters, although not champs, are still having
one of their best post-war seasons. The Cards dropped SC twice, which
marked the end of a long era of Trojan domination over Stanford. The
Cauls stand with a 9-6 record and have one match with Cal left. The juniors
have taken four matches, losing one.
Undefeated after three races each, the Varsity and Jayvee crews will
stand among the tops in the nation. SC, UCLA, and Oregon State have
been outrowcd, but the strokers have yet to face Cal and Washington.
To finish off the Spring Sports picture, the Card fencers are also un
defeated. They beat Cal and won the Northern California open meet.
In summary it looks like two PCC championships, a possible crew title,
runnerups in baseball and track, tops in Bay Area fencing, and a good
record by Bob Renker's net squad. That's a fairly nice picture. Anyhow,
it's our nominee for tops in Stanford's Spring Sports history.
