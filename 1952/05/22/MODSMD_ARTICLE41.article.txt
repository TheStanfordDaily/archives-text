# Long Race Opens PCC Swim Meet
## 
### 
What are undoubtedly the five i
best distance swimmers on ttie Pa
cific Coast will initiate the PCC,
Southern Division, championship
meet today at 4 in the Encina
Plunge, when they duel in the
grueling 1,500-meter race.
Defending champion A 1 Louder
back of California will face a tough
| struggle for retention of his crown
against Pete Cole, Dan Osborne,
! SC's Allen Gilchrist, and UCLA's
Jack Spargo.
Stanford's Cole probably rates the
' best chance of beating Louderback, (
1 as he holds victories over all the
; other contenders at both 220 and 440 ]
yards. In addition he lias placed in j
the NCAA 1,500 for the past three
years.
However, the race shapes up as a j
i closie. While none of the major '
' entries have broken 1!) minutes this
j year, all have approached that j
! mark; and it's a good bet that the ,
j winner will swim fster than Lou
' derback's 19:02.0 of last year,
Other 1,500 entries include John j
j Weiser, Stanford, and Bob Mays, !
I Cal.
The meet will break into full
I bloom tomorrow and Saturday
| when trials and finals in the rest of j
! the 14 events will take place.
Trials will start at 10 each morn- I

*md

ing, and the finals at 3 in the af
ternoon.
The Cards will be overwhelming
favorites to capture their third con
secutive team title by means of
their great depth, but Cal, USC, and
UCLA each boast a couple of men
who can easily break into the indi
vidual win column.
Gilchrist of SC will also be strong
in the '220 and 440; the Trojans' Alex
Mazarik was a close second to Bob
Frojen in their dual meet individual
medley duel; and Jack Lucitt is the
defending champion in high board
diving.
UCLA's Spargo will be a third
top contender for middle distance
honors; and Jack Bodowney of the
Bruins upset Stanford's Bill Glathe
in dual meet diving two weeks ago,
thereby rating a chance for the PCC
crown.
In addition to Louderback, who
will be close up in the 220 and 440,
Cal's strongest entries are Jim Ross,
backstroke, and John Hayes, fresh
man breaststroker.
General admission for Friday and
Saturday is 80 cents and Stanford
students will be admitted for 40
cents.' Today's event is free.


BUTTER-FLYER â€”Here's popular Bob Frojen, who is favored to
cop the breast-stroke in this weekend's PCC meet. The three
day meet begins when a group of the PCC's best distance aces
clash in the grueling 1,500 meter race.
