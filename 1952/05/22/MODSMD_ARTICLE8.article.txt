# Panty Raids Hit Farm
## 
### 
' Parity fever" hit Stanford laic last
nielli when over 200 men, most of
them Encina freshmen, staged a
partially-aborted raid at Roble.
Surrounding Roble, several of the
milling roughs gained entrance
through dining room windows and
the sun porch, stormed through the
corridors, and ransacked rooms in
search of lingerie.
The raiders were dispersed about
11 p.m. when they headed for Bran
ner Hall and IJow houses. Hurlburt
was ransacked, but there was no at
tempt to break into Branner.
At Roble two police aided by En

cina sponsors and RA's held the front
door fast, but a rush at a window
left of the door shattered the glass,
the only reported damage of the
evening.
Shouts of "We want panties" and
"Go, go, go" egged on the aggressive
front ranks. Most of the estimated
200 were bystanders hoping for lire
works.
Chief Counselor for Men Richard
Balch, Fred Glover, assistant to the
president, Bill McColl, Chuck Denny, I
Wlel Butler, and Roble escorts who
had been in the lobby near the 10:30
closing time prevented a mass break- !
through and ejected the over-zealous !

roughs who had forced entry. No
one was held.
Lights popped on and oIT in up
stairs windows as spotlights scanned
the walls and focused on women
shouting instructions to the raiders.
It was on instructions from Robleites
that started the rush to the back
sun-porch where entrance was
gained,
Two-center, 2-B, and 1-A were
I the corridors hardest hit. Women
were hiding in hath tubs, closets,
and showers, but most Robleites tried
to aid the raiders from their room
I windows.

window in search of lingerie. Police and Encina sponsors discouraged the raiders—many of
whom were freshmen. Attempted raids on Branner and Women's Row Houses were even less
successful. —Daily photo by Ed Forner
