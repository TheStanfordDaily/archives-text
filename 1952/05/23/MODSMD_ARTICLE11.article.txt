of the Small Claims Court of Palo
Alto entered judgment denying
Stanford student Jack Rygh $4.20
which he failed to pick up from the
Alpha Phi Omega Book Exchange
earlier this quarter.
Rygh filed suit against the Book
Exchange when he neglected to
pick up his unsold hooka by the
April deadline, and the un
claimed books became the property
of A Phi O according to a contract
signed by the plaintiff.
The Exchange was challenged by
Rygh on the grounds that an un
reasonable time was allowed for
students to claim their money or
books. Judge Hardy explained, how
ever, that the plaintiff knew the
time limit when he left his books
with A Phi O. and therefore he
must have considered the time limit
reasonable at that time.
