# Panty Raid Reaction
## H. DONALD WINBIGLER, Dean of Students 
### 
Frankly I have been guilty of overconfidence. 1 confess it Alone with
everyone else I read about panty raids elsewhere, but I just didn't think
this sort of thing would commend itself to our campus. I have come to
expect from Stanford students a te/ei o; pertormance which is above
average in maturity of judgment. Nino time:, out of ten tin:: expectation
is fully realized.
My confidence was not entirely unjustified even Wednesday night
Bill McColl, Chuck Denny and Mel Butler- to name three -demonstrated
a positive ;&id constructive leadership which is in the best tradition of
student responsibility. There were many others; and the student body can
be proud of them.
Unfortunately the entire campus pays a penalty for the ill-considered
actions of a few, just as universities generally pay a penalty for ill-con
sidered conduct on a relatively small number of campuses. Col lege stu
dents everywhere are on the spot today to justify the selective service
policy of deferment of students. This policy is based on the belief that
education increases the value of men to the country, in view of incidents
of this kind, the public may wcil ask, "Deferment, of students? For what?"
This may be a tribute to spring, but it is hardly a tribute to judgment.
