# DICK KLEIN, Chairman Fundamental Standard Committee

### 
In regards to Wednesday night's raid on Roble and other women's
dorms, the first consideration is that of the application of the Fundamental
Standard. Die Standard is held to be influential enough in our daily life
to preclude such disrespect for order and the rights of others as was
evidenced that night.
Stanford, with its Fundamental Standard and other outstanding prin
ciples, is held in high esteem throughout the nation. When such a thing
as a "panty raid" takes place on this campus, it is top-flight news. As
it goes over the press association wires and into newspapers across the
country, the story becomes more and more distorted. This exaggeration
is what the reading public considers to be the facts and symbolic of Uni
versity life in general. And thus, the public revises their attitude toward
Stanford.
Further, I think it is unfortunate that a few unthinking, irresponsible
members of the student body have violated the trust placed in them by
both the Administration and student leaders. There were no preliminary
warnings or discussion of the possible effects of such "panty raids" because
most felt that it wouldn't happen here. The calibre of the student body
IS'supposed to be sufficiently high so as to rule out the possibility of such
mob violence and resulting destruction. But the trust was misplaced, or
so it seems. The action of these few who led and encouraged the "panty
raid" discredits the entire student body. Such rash, impetuous action should
never be representative of Stanford students.
In a way, the men who participated in the raid and the Roble women
who encouraged them are fortunate that more serious,damage and harm
did not result from their lack of judgment. As for punishment, the entire
University is suffering from Wednesday night's folly.
