# 'Lone Woman' Poll Scheduled
## 
### 
Women's living groups will be
asked to make a decision on "the
lone woman rule" Monday at house
meetings.
At an AWS board meeting yester
day afternoon the group voted to
take an opinion poll Monday nigh).
The alternatives are: 1) is il neces
sary for the women al Stanford to
have "a lone woman rule?" 2)
should the lone woman rule he de
leted from women's social regula
tions?
Girls will also he asked (o give
suggestions concerning the rule,
should it remain as is, should it he
revised. The poll will he tabulated
next week and the results printed
in the Daily.
The rule has been under fire for
more than a year. The original state
ment gave the impression thai the
"lone woman rule" and the Funda
mental Standard were synonymous.
The revision wni show that the rule
is only one aspect considered under
the Fundamental Standard.
Tin* cabinet has .'mud the fol
lowing arguments in favor of keep
ing the rule, either as it stands now,
or in revised form:
1. The reputation of the University
is based on the action of its students.
If society looks upon certain acts as
questionable the name of the in
stitution suffers. The rule provides
as definitely staled policy which the
University can rely on when needed
for public relations.
2. The actions of one Stanford
woman may he interpreted as a re
flection of all Stanford women.
15. "The lone woman rule" is a
standard which is pertinent to so
ciety's generally accepted conven
tion of a lone woman in a man's
residence.
4. Although the Fundamental
Standard is the basis for acceptable
conduct certain rules arc needed.
In opposition to the t ide, the fol
lowing has been suggested:
I. The rule is definitely a nuis
ance, especially when a girl is in
vited to dine, to view television or
to study al a man's residence.
2. The rule is not consistent with
contemporary mores, and has been
proved unenforceable.
4. The Fundamental Standard is
sufficient in this area.
