# Juniors Plan Jazzy Reunion
## 
### 
Good muJc, good refreshments,
and a good tuneâ€”all this will be
featured at the junior class reunion
Sunday night in the back room of
L'Ommie's. The get-together will
begin immediately after the Sunday
night movies.
Highlighting the event will be a
jazz contest between the Alpha Delt
and Phi Delt bands.
Jim Zarifes is chairman of the
reunion. This is the class of '53's
final fling before dead week.
