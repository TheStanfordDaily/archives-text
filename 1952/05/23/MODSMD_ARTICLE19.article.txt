THE LATEST IN GYPSY ADVERTISING-Theta Chi pledges
receive admiring glances (rom Farm coeds, as they don bill
boards and roller skates to advertise the third annual all-campus
Gypsy Dance. Dent Hand's 14-picce band, the "Lamplight
ers," will furnish music for dancing in the Theta Chi living room
and on the roof at the colorful costume party. Refreshments in
the garage "winecellar," hourly hayrides, and firelight fortune
telling will be other free features of the affair.
