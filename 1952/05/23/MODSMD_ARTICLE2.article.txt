rent Communist tactics arc a "mon
umental warning" that the Reds
may plan to use gas or germ war- j
fare in Korea hut said that Allied '
forces are ready for any eventu- '
ality.
Addressing an unusual joint
meeting of Congress, Ridgway said i
constant Red propaganda blasts that '
the UN has used germs and gas is a !

"warning as menacing and as ur
gent as a forest fire hearing flown
upon a wooden village.
But he assured the applauding
Congressmen that the Eighth Army
in Korea i;; ready if the deadlocked
peace talks collapse and full-scale
fighting breaks out anew. At the
same time he admitted the Reds
are much stronger than when the
talks began. Ridgway apparently
was hinting at retaliation.
