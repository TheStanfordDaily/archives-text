officially condemned Wednesday

of these girls saved us from having
a lot more damage." she said
A good numbrr of Row houses
received word of the coming seigr
from Branner and elsewhere, and
most of the doors and wiftdowi
were closed and loeked. In Hurl
burt, il is thought the frenzied
! panty - seekers gained entrance
through a hack door.
In Koble and Branner, the raiding
men entered by devious means. In
some cases, girls co-operated with
the men, directing them where to
enter. This co-operation was cited
in the emergency Excom meeting,
as the women were considered in
many cases as responsible for the
acts as the men.
Despite the divided responsibil -
ity, Excom did not feci that dam
ages should he paid for entirely
out of ASSU funds. They believed
lather that the living group-,
should pay according to their re
sponsibility.
It will be up to the combined ju
dicial councils lo make the final
recommendations, a.s Excom did no<
feci competent to make any binding
decisions yesterday afternoon.
Meanwhile all yesterday the topic
of discussion was the raid, and cam
pus opinion varied.
