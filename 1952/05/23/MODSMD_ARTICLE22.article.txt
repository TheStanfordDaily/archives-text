# CAMPUS OPINION
## 'We Are Supposed to Differ' 
### 
To thr: Editor:
That Stanford students were influenced by the im
mature actions ol underwear fetishists ;it colleues
throughout the country is hard to understand. We
.iii supposed to differ from state universities in thai
admit only those students who possess hij'.h in
tellectual and moral qualities as well as good emo
tional stability. Wednesday night's outburst proved
t ii. Lo be false.
There are a number of factors that played im
portant pails in touching off the moderately success
ful "panty raid" at this campus. The Daily's attitude
in treating similar activities at other schools (minus
> litorial comment) as something humorous is a prime
m i'mi for Stanford students to take up the call. It
r realized, of course, that the Daily does not condone
the; action of the raiding mobs, but it did not treat il
:r a serious matter.
(l'I«lltor's note: llaily "treatment" consisted of
printing UP wire service stories in the same cate
gory as other regular news stories in "This Mor
ning's Headlines," which are not edited.)
Other factors: prominent members of the student
body showing themselves to be "leaders" ol an un-
Javorable sort, the campus policeman at Brainier who
chuckled a? he watched several men enter a nearby
Inst story window, the lais.se/ faire altitude of many,
typified by such remarks as, "Let the guys have a
;-uod time," or "I'm here to watch the lun," the now
we ran-get-away-wi th-something attitude ol the
people in a mob, an immature disrespect for private
pi opei ty and personal privacy , and. perhaps Worst ol

all, the attitude taken by many of the girls who yelled
taunting words of semi-encouragement and one of
whom remarked us the crowd withdrew at Brannei',
"I was sorta hoping they'd break in."
Let us hope that student spirit will take a less
disgraceful turn in the future.

(Editor's Note: In hindsight, could the raid have
been prevented? The Daily perhaps was at fault
for its absence of editorial comment on similar
incidents on other campuses. The Dean of Students
Office perhaps should have made a statement. The
Fundamental Standard Committee likewise may
have neglected its duty.
1 tit is all hindsight, We made the mistake of
assuming that a warning would have been not only
unnecessary at Stanford but would have bordered
on the insulting; the mistake of assuming that Stan
ford students would not succumb to the follow-the
leader psychology; and the mistake of overestimat
ing the powers of judgment of a high-spirited few.
The publicity the Daily gave to similar incidents
undoubtedly added to the focus of attention on the
panty raid craze. Kut to assume that the Daily is
the only contact with such episodes is absurd.
We feel (he stories were played in the proper
proportion and if any error was made it was in
underplaying them. For the Daily not to report
the news or bury i' we feel, is a greatei disservice
to the reader.)

(Editor's Note: In hindsight, could the raid have
been prevented? The Daily perhaps was at fault
for its absence of editorial comment on similar
incidents on other campuses. The Dean of Students
Office perhaps should have made a statement. The
Fundamental Standard Committee likewise may
have neglected its duty.
1 tit is all hindsight, We made the mistake of
assuming that a warning would have been not only
unnecessary at Stanford but would have bordered
on the insulting; the mistake of assuming that Stan
ford students would not succumb to the follow-the
leader psychology; and the mistake of overestimat
ing the powers of judgment of a high-spirited few.
The publicity the Daily gave to similar incidents
undoubtedly added to the focus of attention on the
panty raid craze. Kut to assume that the Daily is
the only contact with such episodes is absurd.
We feel (he stories were played in the proper
proportion and if any error was made it was in
underplaying them. For the Daily not to report
the news or bury i' we feel, is a greatei disservice
to the reader.)
To thr: Editor:
That Stanford students were influenced by the im
mature actions ol underwear fetishists ;it colleues
throughout the country is hard to understand. We
.iii supposed to differ from state universities in thai
admit only those students who possess hij'.h in
tellectual and moral qualities as well as good emo
tional stability. Wednesday night's outburst proved
t ii. Lo be false.
There are a number of factors that played im
portant pails in touching off the moderately success
ful "panty raid" at this campus. The Daily's attitude
in treating similar activities at other schools (minus
> litorial comment) as something humorous is a prime
m i'mi for Stanford students to take up the call. It
r realized, of course, that the Daily does not condone
the; action of the raiding mobs, but it did not treat il
:r a serious matter.
(l'I«lltor's note: llaily "treatment" consisted of
printing UP wire service stories in the same cate
gory as other regular news stories in "This Mor
ning's Headlines," which are not edited.)
Other factors: prominent members of the student
body showing themselves to be "leaders" ol an un-
Javorable sort, the campus policeman at Brainier who
chuckled a? he watched several men enter a nearby
Inst story window, the lais.se/ faire altitude of many,
typified by such remarks as, "Let the guys have a
;-uod time," or "I'm here to watch the lun," the now
we ran-get-away-wi th-something attitude ol the
people in a mob, an immature disrespect for private
pi opei ty and personal privacy , and. perhaps Worst ol

all, the attitude taken by many of the girls who yelled
taunting words of semi-encouragement and one of
whom remarked us the crowd withdrew at Brannei',
"I was sorta hoping they'd break in."
Let us hope that student spirit will take a less
