# Tuition Hikes and June Jobs
## 
### 
To the Editor:
This morning I am ashamed io ailmil that I am a
Stanford student. Last Sunday my parents had a
house lull of guests who eventually came to speak
.villi much disgust* aljout the "Pantie-Raid.s" which
arc sweeping the nation's college campus seen:-. They
naturally asked for my opinion on whether it might
happen at Stanford. I also hitch-hiked to school Mon
day morning, and received a similar inquiry from the
i < ntleman who carried me to Redwood City.
I answered both inquiries to the effect that Stanford
•indents would not think of bringing such discredit
on their line university. It now appears that a .size
able group of students • reported to be "Some <4(i0" by
tlit S.l\ Chronicle are neither mature, intelligent,
nor concerned one bit about the reputation of their
university.
You can imagine how the general public feel:, about
the problem. What chance then has the June gradu
ate got of getting a job with any businessman who
has heard of the incident? Not nearly so good as i!
might have been last week.
Stanford is supported hy gifts from a public that
believes that those ideas of Stanford which I possessed
until this morning are the truth. The public cannot
withdraw its support of state universities, but there
inn: t be strong inclinations 1o withdraw support of
private .schools when such immature iictions occur.
One such incident can do more harm to our public
relations than winning the Rose Uowl could possibly
help them.
Maybe some people don't care whether gifts to
the univer.'ity fall off or not. All I can say is that they
mi.e.t have a lot ol money they want to get rid of, and

they don't care if the tuition goes up next year, 'lliere
are some of us that can't afford a hike.
