# Goldfish and Fads
## 
### 
To the Editoi': â€¢ -
Let us hope that some moron in an Eastern univer
sity does not swallow a goldfish. Since what proud
parents believe to be the thinkers and doers of to
morrow are the imitators of today, no hapless carp
would be safe. One would think that with the vaunted
intellect of Stanford students at least one out of a
couple hundred party boys could evolve a plan which
would not put us among the last to adopt a decaying
fad.
Thank God we're graduating before the whole stu
dent body goes to pot!
