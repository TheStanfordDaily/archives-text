### HADLEY ROFF Daily Political Editor 
Judging by his cheery smile and his hearty handshake, Gov.
Earl Warren is undaunted in his try ior the GOP Presidential no'm-1
illation. I
Though vicim of a sledge-hammer defeat in Oregon last week,:
Warren talked of "providing energetic leadership for the nation" i '

| when he spoke at a giant, Kepuim
can rally in San Francisco Wednes
day night.
He told the 1,000 enthusiastic Re
publicans aL tlie meeting in .the
Fairmont Hotel that it elected h?
would do his "level best, without
I selfishness, to lead the nation to the
I .volution ol its problems, domestic
j and foreign."
He spoke .simply and humhly. llt
made many references to his rela
tionship with the voter. Looking
out over the crowded auditorium,
California's Governor said, "You
| have given me the courage to do
i what should be done."
At another point he remarked.
! "To have your re pert is my life
| time satisfaction."
His warm smiie and folksy
'peaking stvle won many in the
audience. The reaction to his
I speech was spontaneous and on
| the whole appreciative.
11l Sun Francisco for the kick-off
j of the' campaign for the election of
( his 70-man delegation in tin- June
j primary, the Gover nor spoke at a
j giant rally attended by Republican
J leaders from throughout the state.
He said that he will make a de
termined fight for the Presidency.
hut, he added, "if it appears I
cannot win the nomination, mv
j delegation will be released to vole
| for vvhomevcr they please."
He emphasized that "no dele
gate has heen asked a v ingle
| question to control his action at
the conference other than to sup
port me."
"Every one i.s a free agent,'' he
I declared.
Seeking to cinch party support,
! Warren .said that lie would say
I nothing derogatory ol other candi
dates. "Candidates, that is . . . not
pseudo-candidates," he inserted, an
obvious reference to the campaign
of Congressman Werdel from San
| Diego.
Werdel, leader of an anti-Warren
! faction, was called "hateful" hy tin
| Governor.
Thotyh Warren never men
tioned Werdel by name, he made
obvious reference when lie harsh
ly reprimanded (ho e ' people who
wotih; like to dominate the state
j government by cajoling and in
timidating ih.' Governor ivtfio is
; elected by the people."
He said such people become
"hateful" when their bills are not
passed or when bills they oppo..i
j are passed.
Swinging hard into the Werdel
I group, lie said that they were not
I men who took an active part in
: government "but who stood on the
fringes, trying to trip up the ad
j ministration."
describing Ids 10 vears as Gov
! ernor, Warren declared that liis
administration has "rendered ev
ery service demanded by the
state's growth." lie said he lias
made ev». v effort "to conserv?
California'*, natural and human re-
I sources."
Speaking of "human objectives,'
! the good - looking Governor sale
! that the nation should not fear So
j trial progress. He asserted, "We'rf

♦
no! moving forward ;it home as we ' 1
should."
lie decried, however. (lie "trend |
toward centralization." He said
that "much government power 1
should he returned to the people 1
at the community level."
Hammering hard at the theme of
a federal "power-grab," the Cover- (
nor saitl that "centralization has |
readied such a place that the ad
ministration no longer can f itict an- j
thority for-power in the Constitu
tion or the laws of the Union."
A( a Young Republican meet- I
ing in Sail Francisco following I lie j
rally, he recapped the arguments J
being used by the government in !
; the steel seizure case no.v p tid
ing before the Sin.veine Court. He
branded the arguments "terrify -
ing."
"If 1 heard the argument on a |
radio or TV show, 1 would have said j
that iL was exaggerated," lit- Udd the
youths.
