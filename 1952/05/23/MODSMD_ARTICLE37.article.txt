# [illegible] Plans Model Schools

### BARBARA TUERK 
You enter the basement
through a double-swinging door
with both metal casements dif
ferent, walk past several minia
ture plantings, and find yourself
in a maze of doll-house school
rooms, flashing lights, complex
color wheels, and multi - hued
"chalk boards."
The walls are wood, tile, glass, or
plastic, all at once, and the flooring
changes composition every few feet.
Over in one corner you spy several
dozen door handles, and on the
other side of the room a collection
of fi rebel Is. And everywhere are
signs of expansion, carpenters and
saws and plywood.
And all this in Cubbcrley base
ment!
Stanford's School Planning Labo
ratory, the brain child of Dr. James
D. MacConnell, Associate Dean of
the School of Education, is the first
of its kind in the nation.
Its purposes are several. In re
cent years many talented indi
viduals, working largely by them
selves, have developed new meth
ods of school construction, cur
riculum. and instruction. The
Stanford Lab is designed to test
and to integrate all these discov
eries, and to turn research into
action.
The Laboratory's resources pro
vide an important addition to the
School of Education's school plan
ning classes, and provide many
important services to community
groups outside the University.
The School Planning Consultation
Service, made up of the Lab's re
searchers, is available to any school
district or school architect wishing
aid in planning school facilities.
Under the Research Projects Pro
gram the researchers help such in
terested groups as school equipment
industries experiment with school
materials.
This summer the Laboratory
will sponsor a scries of six School
Planning Conferences on Day
lighting, Artificial Lighting, Col
or, Equipment, Thermal Envi
ronment, and Architecture and
Administration. Combined with
the conferences will be a four-to
eiglit-week graduate study course.
The school planners, graduate re
searchers, and education classes
find a wealth of facilities with which
to work. Lining the walls of the
Laboratory are demonstration in
serts dealing with control of natural
and artificial light., heat and ventila
tion, furniture and equipment ar
rangement.
A fundamental laboratory pro
vides space for experiments in light
and color, heat physics, sound con- I
trol, and elementary mechanics.
A conference area used for
meetings with the school-commu
nity groups is adjacent to another
section which will soon house the
proposed Bibliographic Center, in
which will he assembled bibliog
raphies of every known work
dealing with life pertinent as
pects of school planning.
Ihe Laboratory's demonstration
projects include a smoke-ptifT test
ed map showing the circulation of i
air in a school room, the new desks i
with 20 per cent tilted tops (which
recent tests have proved lessen back
and eye-strain for the child), and
a demonstration of two ceiling lights
of equal power, one brighter than
the other because one is reflected
of! a white ceiling and the other
cast straight down into the room.
