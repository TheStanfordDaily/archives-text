## Laugh It Off? You Can't 
### 
A new waveol collocjc hijinks thai has mani
fested itself in the form of ico cream riots. Poqo
(or President riots, and especially panty raids
hit Stanford Wednesday night in the latter form.
The craze hit Stanford unoriginally, tritely, stu
pidly, and most unfortunately.
It can't happen here? It did. Thousands of
Bay Area newspaper readers knew it happened
when a two inch banner headline in the San
Francisco Examiner stared them in the face yes
terday morning.
Wednesday night's panty raids, engineered
by a few but encouraged by many, hit news
papers all over the country, winged across the
nation by the wire services in usually exag
gerated accounts.
The spirit of the idiocy v/as probably healthy.
It v/as all intended as harmless horseplay with
a lot of laughs for everyone. But you can't laugh
off public reaction. It is the "horseplay" like
last night that makes the headlines, not the
scholarship winning, the average doctoral
thesis, the Stanford crew, the success of the
Plonor Code, or the many other positive aspects
of Stanford.
The raids Wednesday night, unwittingly to
he sure, but just as surely censurable, went
a long way toward discrediting Stanford in
particular and college education in general
in the public mind. Laugh it off? You can't.
It took colleges ten years to live down the
gold fish swallowing, the flag pole sitting, the
frivolities of American college youth in the
'20's. The new wave of shenanigans threatens
to associate frivolity with education again.

Ft was lo be hoped Stanford would not be
associated with the modern craze. But it will
irrevocably be associated with it.
We could mention the actual danger in terms
of property damage, loss of personal property,
and personal injury. It's no joke when you
lose a closet full of $10 slips or silk stockings.
Broken windows aren't funny. Real as these
dangers are, and while they were minimized
in the Wednesday night fiasco, we are even
more concerned with the public relations as
pect.
It is unfortunate that the impression the public
gets is misleading. We know it is misleading,
but nonetheless it is not easily removed.
It was not the Stanford student body that
staged the raid. It was a thoughtless few aided
and abetted by the many. The v/omen who
shouted encouragement from the Roble win
dows and the men in the rear ranks of the crowd
who yielded to mob hysteria are just as much
to blame as the lew who actually carried out
the raid.
It is another case of the many suffering bo
cause of a thoughtless minority, who picked
an unfortunate, unnecessary way to blow off
a little steam.
When you think of the prestige and premium
placed on college education, when you con
sider that college men are being deferred from
military service to pursue education, and when
you consider the public thinking of education in
terms of Wednesday night's stupidity, you see
the ridiculous situation it is.
Was the big laugh really worth it?

off public reaction. It is the "horseplay" like

Plonor Code, or the many other positive aspects
of Stanford.
