slowt-i than Al Louden back's meet record last year.
Loudeiback. swimming for University of California, could do

no better than third yesterday as
Cole, hampered by the effects ol a
cohl which has plagued him all this
week, managed to hang on lor the
second spot.
Together with sl*th-place John
Weiser, Cole and Osborne got
Stanford otl' to a big lead for team
honors, piling up 1:1 points be
tween them in the single race
field yesterday,
Cal got four for Louderback's
third place; UCLA, three by virtue
of .Jack Spargo's fourth; and SC,
two; with Allen Gilchrist in fifth
place.
Today and tomorrow the meet
shifts hifo high' ge'hr with trials (10
a.m.) and linaLs (3 p.m.) scheduled
in seven events each day.
Though they are without the
services of Bob Thompson, side
lined with mononucleosis, the
Cards will be heavily favored to
walk off with the team title and
a majority of the individual
championships.
Six Stanford seniors who will bow
out of intercollegiate competition
'this week are figured to score heav
ily. »■*••««
Heading the list is team captain
Bob Frojen, who is. favored in both
breaststroke events and the 150-
yai.d individual medley. Frojen
stands an excellent chance to topple
tils own rpeet jecotfi, set lasjt year,
in the 100-yard butterfly event, and
could also crack the 200-yard mark.
Bruce Putnam, number two on
the graduating list, is entered in
the ,100 and 220 freestyle as well as
the medley. He should score in all
three? being favored to capture the
100 title.
Bili Glathe will be out to defend

his low board diving title and to
wrest the high board crown from
SC's Ed Lucitt, whom lie beat in
the Trojan - Card dual meet two
weeks ago.
Cole, despite his defeat in the
1,500-meter, is still top mail in
the middle distances on the
strength of his dual meet vic
tories.* A double win in the 220
atid 440 would be a fitting gradu
ation present for the Santa Mon
ica surfboard flash.
Phil Chapman, who rates a strong
threat in £he 10() and 50 freestyle,
and Ftuss LaTellc, swimming both
breast-strokes, complete-the libt.
Admission for each remaining day
of the meet will be 80 cents for
adults and 40 cents for Stanford
students.
