# PRO AND CAHA

### 
There are few universities in this nation that the sti e.
requirements that Stanford places before all aspirants ca er for
education. And yet in the face o ( this, Stanford mai r : a n
program and usually ends up with a fair to middling record
taken in its entirety.
Such a feat is to be admired. Stanford is not an athlctic in ft'
Stanford has never sought athletes in the menrer thrt p-,t y i~" ' '
do. Athletes are welcome provided they meet the tests that c<n'>- .
other applicants.
And hand in hand with this policy is one carried out by t>-e re
staff. The general philosophy that is believed and taufht bv tK
on the Farm is a simple one. It basically follows the theory that ati
are not by any means everything in life.
However when we hear or read criticism, criticism that we have
written ourselves, to the effect that coach so-and-so should he Fred
Stanford would win this or that, if it wasn't for this coach, we «"m?
wonder. We wonder how important a part athletics do nlay in c*.
life. And whether athletics are the superlative of all that Stanford «
Coach Everett Dean, who without being witty we may call the
of Stanford coaching, has said that athletics are a means to an er.
not the ultimate goal in life. And the rest of the Stanford coaehint
adheres to that thought. Chuck Taylor, Bob Burnett, Ray Lunny,
Weiershauser, Tom Haynie and all the others, firmly believe that t!
dividual comes before the win or the loss.
For this attitude Stanford coaching policy has often been crit
111 ere is no question that proper athletics build men, but there iy
reason to believe that improper athletics can definitely harm men
we mean improper in the way players are often taught to win
costs. And we don't mean ruin men physically but rather morally th
improper coaching philosophy.
Mr. Dean believes that all evils in .amateur athletics grow from (
more of three causes, 1), proselyting and subsidizing, 2), gamblir
and Post season games.
It is true that Stanford went to the Rose Bowl this year but I
Taylor declared at the time that he was opposed to it.
Oil times necessity and obligation dictate policy.
However it is a blessing that Stanford is relatively bare of any of
three evils. All of these evils result from over-emphasis and it
responsibility of the administration of the university to stamp out
faults. The Stanford administration has done an excellent job.
And exactly what do Stanford coaches try and impart to men
play for them? Granted they instruct them to play, to play ti» win
to play hard. But above all they teach them what it is to be a gent).,
what it is io gain sportsmanship. There has also been criticism
gentlemen don't win. We feel that with very few exceptions Stai
athletes are gentlemen. And the records show that Stanford atl
teams consistently win more than they lose.
But what are the lessons of good athletics that can be learned an
are stressed by Stanford's Coaching board?
Mr. Dean has mentioned numerous educational values that coach*
bestow upon their players, values that can make college boys mi.
line men.
Mr. Dean's values may be listed without undo explanation. Leadt
respect for authority, beneficial health habits, sportsmanship, team
responsibility and good citizenship, are all essential. Furthermore tl
given by coaches in social, emotional, physical, moral, and mental pro
all make for a better man. So there they are, the essentials of a do
that any conscientious coach will impress upon his men.
And we are not getting soft, when we staunchly agree with such £.
Winning is fine, there is nothing like it. But if to win we must
the qualities that make a gentleman, then winning is not worth it.
To date Stanford has won with a coaching staff of gentlemen and t
of gentlemen. And that Is good. But if Stanford ever makes athletic
ultimate lather than the means to a better man, that is when we
advocate Stanford's dropping from athletic competition.
