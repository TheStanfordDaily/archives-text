on the ha. is of that triumph, I
zool ned to llit' nuniher one spot in j
national rowing circles.
The Newport meet hoi is down to
he the all-important race for Indian
Coach Boh White's hoys. They are
a pre-niL'et favorite to reach the
iinule, hot are looking for an upset !
V/ iii over one of Cal's strongest
crews in re-cent years. A victory j
over the Golden Dear would put a |
nick in Cal hopes for Olympic com- i
petition and push "little" Stanford
into the national limelight.

Card crew mentor White, a for
mer Cal cox under Fbrighl several
years back, has taken a "wait and
sec" attitude regarding tomorrow's
splash festivities. White cites how
well Cal looked in trimming a line
Husky outfit last week, though not
overlooking the showings of his own
Indians in their three victories. This
year's Card crew is perhaps the
strongest since the sport was re
inaugurated in 1!J45.
Not having been extended lliii*

- far this season, White's outfit may
I have .something extra when they
I meet their traditional rival. In their
s | three outings, the Indians turned in
v* j good olockin 'S over the official
e 2.U1J0 meter course, though lacking

j strong competition.
