The Characters: A ruddy-faced, grey-haired professor of politi
cal science, Graham 11. Stuart, and a green reporter from the
school paper.
The Plot: An attempt on the part of the reporter to tell (in 300

carefully eho en words or loss) the
life of this popular man whose title
of professor seems almost incidental
♦ d those of statesman, c au
thor, lecturer, foreign service ad
viser, and international lawyer.
Dr. Stuart, who is due to retire
this June, came to Stanford in 1923
with an education cleaned from
Western reserve, University of
Wisconsin, and five years of study
in Paris.
Hie chief chanre in Stanford
since that date, he said in an in
terview Monday, is the growth in
tlie size of classes. "When I first
canic, I knew my students," he
recalled. "Now seminars are the
only small groups left." When
asked if he preferred conducting
seminars to lecture courses, he
replied, "I cn.ioy teaching, pe
riod."
(Evidently, the students enjoy Dr.
Stuart, too, for tacked on the back
of his office door was a large chalk
caricature of him, iabeled "The
Pupil's Choice" — a presentation
from Lathrop where he had dined
the night before.)
Dr. Stuart has been an ex
change professor at Washington.
Oregon, Utah. UC, USC, Wiscon
sin, Minnesota, Western Reserve,
Duke, and NYU. "And NO
WHERE," he noted, "have I seen
in students such a fear of apple
polishing as I have at Stanford."
Dr. Stuart feels this attitude puts
an undesirable barrier between the
student and the teacher and is "es
pecially unfortunate at' a smaller
school like Stanford." His solution
of the problem, he revealed with
twinkling brown eyes, is to hold
seminars at his own home in Palo
Alto. "I sort of force the issue," he
smiled.
During the 'twenties and 'thir
ties Dr. Stuart made three trips to
Europe and lei-lived at graduate
schools in Geneva, Paris, and The
Hague.
When World V'nr II broke out,
he was callcd to We llington where
he was an analyst in the Board of
Economic Warfare and later headed

the Historical Records Unit of the
State Department.
The year 1946 found Dr. Stuart
in Morocco as adviser to the
American minister in drafting a
new statute for the international
city of Tangier.
In 1948, Secretary of State Georgr
Mar hall appointed Stuart to th r
advisory committee on the Foreicr
Service Institute of the State De
partment. At this time he complete(
his book entitled ''The Departmeni
of State."
Stuart's other hooks include:
• American Diplomatic and Con
sular Practice" (this is the stand
ard handbook for U.S. foreign
service officers), "Latin America
and the U. 5.." and"The Interna
tional City of Tangier."
As if writing books weren't
enough, Dr. Stuart finds time to edit
them. He has the job of judging
books for the annual Wendell Will
kie Political Science Award and is
editor of the Stanford Books on
World Politics. The Stanford books
have been written by students, pro
fessors, and lawyers, and are pub
lished by the Stanford Press.
Upon retirement this June, Dr.
Stuart will go to .Washington,
where he will give seminars in
foreign servicc at the School of
Advanced International Studies.
Foreign service as a profession,
he feels, is "more impi.vtant than
ever." He said that advancement
is mainlv on the basis of merit
and several Farm students have
done well in that field.
Dr. Stuart is married and has two
daughters, both Stanford graduates.
The younger one, Ann, is a doctor
of medicine, soon to begin resident
ship at Bellevue Hospital in Wash
ington. Joan, the older daughter, is
married. Mrs. Stuart plans to join
her husband in the East this fall.
Dr. Stuart named bridge as his
principal hobby. He has played
with friends "every Monday
night for 20 years." lie can re
call playing with Elv Culbertson
in Paris before contract and auc

tiou bridge were even known.
They called it bridge-whist then.
Dr. Stuart said that he hates to
leave Stanford. "It's a hard school
to beat when it comes to pleasant
surroundings and a fine student
body," he said.
The student body, on the other
hand, hates to see Dr. Stuart leave.

Dr. Stuart, who is due to retire
this June, came to Stanford in 1923
with an education cleaned from
Western reserve, University of
Wisconsin, and five years of study
in Paris.
Hie chief chanre in Stanford
since that date, he said in an in
terview Monday, is the growth in
tlie size of classes. "When I first
canic, I knew my students," he
recalled. "Now seminars are the
only small groups left." When
asked if he preferred conducting
seminars to lecture courses, he
replied, "I cn.ioy teaching, pe
riod."
(Evidently, the students enjoy Dr.
Stuart, too, for tacked on the back
of his office door was a large chalk
caricature of him, iabeled "The
Pupil's Choice" — a presentation

the night before.)
Dr. Stuart has been an ex
change professor at Washington.
Oregon, Utah. UC, USC, Wiscon
sin, Minnesota, Western Reserve,
Duke, and NYU. "And NO
WHERE," he noted, "have I seen
in students such a fear of apple
polishing as I have at Stanford."
Dr. Stuart feels this attitude puts
an undesirable barrier between the
student and the teacher and is "es
pecially unfortunate at' a smaller
school like Stanford." His solution
of the problem, he revealed with
twinkling brown eyes, is to hold
seminars at his own home in Palo
Alto. "I sort of force the issue," he
smiled.
During the 'twenties and 'thir

Europe and lei-lived at graduate
schools in Geneva, Paris, and The

The SetHnq: A hook-lined olfico in the Poli Sci Deportment,
Inner Quad, Stanford.
The Characters: A ruddy-faced, grey-haired professor of politi
cal science, Graham 11. Stuart, and a green reporter from the
school paper.
The Plot: An attempt on the part of the reporter to tell (in 300

carefully eho en words or loss) the
life of this popular man whose title
of professor seems almost incidental
♦ d those of statesman, c au
thor, lecturer, foreign service ad
viser, and international lawyer.
Dr. Stuart, who is due to retire
this June, came to Stanford in 1923
with an education cleaned from
Western reserve, University of
Wisconsin, and five years of study
in Paris.
Hie chief chanre in Stanford
since that date, he said in an in
terview Monday, is the growth in
tlie size of classes. "When I first
canic, I knew my students," he
recalled. "Now seminars are the
only small groups left." When
asked if he preferred conducting
seminars to lecture courses, he
replied, "I cn.ioy teaching, pe
riod."
(Evidently, the students enjoy Dr.
Stuart, too, for tacked on the back
of his office door was a large chalk
caricature of him, iabeled "The
Pupil's Choice" — a presentation
from Lathrop where he had dined
the night before.)
Dr. Stuart has been an ex
change professor at Washington.
Oregon, Utah. UC, USC, Wiscon
sin, Minnesota, Western Reserve,
Duke, and NYU. "And NO
WHERE," he noted, "have I seen
in students such a fear of apple
polishing as I have at Stanford."
Dr. Stuart feels this attitude puts
an undesirable barrier between the
student and the teacher and is "es
pecially unfortunate at' a smaller
school like Stanford." His solution
of the problem, he revealed with
twinkling brown eyes, is to hold
seminars at his own home in Palo
Alto. "I sort of force the issue," he
smiled.
During the 'twenties and 'thir
ties Dr. Stuart made three trips to
Europe and lei-lived at graduate
schools in Geneva, Paris, and The
Hague.
When World V'nr II broke out,
he was callcd to We llington where
he was an analyst in the Board of
Economic Warfare and later headed

the Historical Records Unit of the
State Department.
The year 1946 found Dr. Stuart
in Morocco as adviser to the
American minister in drafting a
new statute for the international
city of Tangier.
In 1948, Secretary of State Georgr
Mar hall appointed Stuart to th r
advisory committee on the Foreicr
Service Institute of the State De
partment. At this time he complete(
his book entitled ''The Departmeni
of State."
Stuart's other hooks include:
• American Diplomatic and Con
sular Practice" (this is the stand
ard handbook for U.S. foreign
service officers), "Latin America
and the U. 5.." and"The Interna
tional City of Tangier."
As if writing books weren't
enough, Dr. Stuart finds time to edit
them. He has the job of judging
books for the annual Wendell Will
kie Political Science Award and is
editor of the Stanford Books on
World Politics. The Stanford books
have been written by students, pro
fessors, and lawyers, and are pub
lished by the Stanford Press.
Upon retirement this June, Dr.
Stuart will go to .Washington,
where he will give seminars in
foreign servicc at the School of
Advanced International Studies.
Foreign service as a profession,
he feels, is "more impi.vtant than
ever." He said that advancement
is mainlv on the basis of merit
and several Farm students have
done well in that field.
Dr. Stuart is married and has two
daughters, both Stanford graduates.
The younger one, Ann, is a doctor
of medicine, soon to begin resident
ship at Bellevue Hospital in Wash
ington. Joan, the older daughter, is
married. Mrs. Stuart plans to join
her husband in the East this fall.
Dr. Stuart named bridge as his
principal hobby. He has played
with friends "every Monday
night for 20 years." lie can re
call playing with Elv Culbertson
in Paris before contract and auc

tiou bridge were even known.
They called it bridge-whist then.
Dr. Stuart said that he hates to
leave Stanford. "It's a hard school
to beat when it comes to pleasant
surroundings and a fine student
body," he said.
The student body, on the other
hand, hates to see Dr. Stuart leave.
