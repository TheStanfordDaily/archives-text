# The 						'Lone Woman Rule' Controversy
## 
### 
Turn to page six of the little gray and red
booklet tilled "Social Standards Made lor the
Women Students of Stanford University."
There, under "General Policies," you will find
the following:
"It is not considered acceptable under the
Fundamental Standard for a woman student to
be in a man's residence, fraternity, or apart
ment, on or off campus save in the company of
at leapt one other woman."
This is the famous "Lone Woman Rule"
long a topic of controversy. This week the
Fundamental Standard Committee will present
n revision of it to the Student Body.
This recommendation is the outgrowth of
two years of Eundamental Standard Commit
tee discussions with representatives from the
Administration, Associated Woman Students,
fraternities, and other interested groups. The
first real steps toward getting the change
made were the result of much hard v/ork on
the part of the current committee.
Last Wednesday the issue finally escaped
from AWS committee and was aired by the
AWS Board. Tonight comes the next step. A
poll will be taken in house meetings to deter
mine if v/ornen want the rule kept in its same
or revised form or if they want it thrown out
entirely. The result of the voting will largely
determine the kind of recommendation the
Fundamental Standard Committee will make
when it reports on the issue at Excom Wednes
day night.
The incongruity of the rule is plain. As it now
stands, a girl violates the Fundamental Stand
ard when she goes unaccompanied into a fra
ternity house to borrow a card table or to leave
an election poster. She violates the Standard
when she and her escort study or watch TV in
the living room of a man's residence.
Another unfortunate aspect is that the rule
is frequently violated. Eraternity men—when
asked for their opinion—were frank to admit
that it is not respected. The rule thus seems
close to unenforceable and out of line with
current practices. Imagine too the kind of
double thinking demanded of a freshman giil
who learns that there are some parts of the
social regulations we obey and others we
merely wink at.

But this is the negative side. A rule like this
can have two functions: (1) it can contribute to
morality; (2) it can provide a definitely staled
policy which the University can rely on when it
needs to for public relations.
We believe the lone woman rule as it now
stands makes no contribution to morality not
already covered by the Fundamental Standard.
If a girl enters a man's house for an immoral
purpose, she is breaking the Fundamental
Standard whether or not the specific rule exists.
Hut it is because of the second—the public
relations — consideration, among other rea
sons, that we favor revising the rule instead
of just junking it. A University is expected to
toe a narrow line where morality is con
cerned. And the Administration feels that a
rule of this kind is needed as a well-deline
ated moral standard to help girls judge what
kind of conduct is considered acceptable.
Practicality is another factor. Women can
expect privacy to study in the living room in
their pajamas after 10.30—0r midnight on week
ends. Is it fair to deny men the same privilege?
Therefore, we would favor a new rule like
the one the Fundamental Standard Committee
recommends: "A Stanford woman may be in
the social area of a man's residence, on or off
campus, until 10:30 p.m. On campus she may
remain until 12 midnight Friday and Saturday
nights."
The committee defines the "social area" as
"the living, study, or recreation area, not the
area of retirement." Their report on the subject
further explains, "Infractions of this policy are
subject to the interpretation of Women's Coun
cil. Bases for judgment and penalty decision
shall be: (1) behavior and conduct of the in
dividual in regards to application of the Funda
mental Standard; (2) violation of the time limi
tation."
We hope the women of Stanford will
choose neither to retain a rule which seems
to v.s much in need of change nor to com
pletely abandon the rule. We hope they will
choose to move ahead with a more practical,
more enlightened form of the regulation.

recommends: "A Stanford woman may be in
the social area of a man's residence, on or off
campus, until 10:30 p.m. On campus she may
remain until 12 midnight Friday and Saturday
nights."
The committee defines the "social area" as
"the living, study, or recreation area, not the
area of retirement." Their report on the subject
further explains, "Infractions of this policy are
subject to the interpretation of Women's Coun
cil. Bases for judgment and penalty decision
shall be: (1) behavior and conduct of the in
dividual in regards to application of the Funda
mental Standard; (2) violation of the time limi
tation."
We hope the women of Stanford will
choose neither to retain a rule which seems
to v.s much in need of change nor to com
pletely abandon the rule. We hope they will
choose to move ahead with a more practical,
more enlightened form of the regulation.

booklet tilled "Social Standards Made lor the
Women Students of Stanford University."
There, under "General Policies," you will find
the following:
"It is not considered acceptable under the
Fundamental Standard for a woman student to
be in a man's residence, fraternity, or apart
ment, on or off campus save in the company of
at leapt one other woman."
This is the famous "Lone Woman Rule"
long a topic of controversy. This week the
Fundamental Standard Committee will present
n revision of it to the Student Body.
This recommendation is the outgrowth of
two years of Eundamental Standard Commit
tee discussions with representatives from the
Administration, Associated Woman Students,
fraternities, and other interested groups. The
first real steps toward getting the change
made were the result of much hard v/ork on
the part of the current committee.
Last Wednesday the issue finally escaped
from AWS committee and was aired by the
AWS Board. Tonight comes the next step. A
poll will be taken in house meetings to deter
mine if v/ornen want the rule kept in its same
or revised form or if they want it thrown out
entirely. The result of the voting will largely
determine the kind of recommendation the
Fundamental Standard Committee will make
when it reports on the issue at Excom Wednes
day night.
The incongruity of the rule is plain. As it now
stands, a girl violates the Fundamental Stand
ard when she goes unaccompanied into a fra
ternity house to borrow a card table or to leave
an election poster. She violates the Standard
when she and her escort study or watch TV in
the living room of a man's residence.
Another unfortunate aspect is that the rule
is frequently violated. Eraternity men—when
asked for their opinion—were frank to admit
that it is not respected. The rule thus seems
close to unenforceable and out of line with
current practices. Imagine too the kind of
double thinking demanded of a freshman giil
who learns that there are some parts of the
social regulations we obey and others we
merely wink at.

But this is the negative side. A rule like this
can have two functions: (1) it can contribute to
morality; (2) it can provide a definitely staled
policy which the University can rely on when it
needs to for public relations.
We believe the lone woman rule as it now
stands makes no contribution to morality not
already covered by the Fundamental Standard.
If a girl enters a man's house for an immoral
purpose, she is breaking the Fundamental
Standard whether or not the specific rule exists.
Hut it is because of the second—the public
relations — consideration, among other rea
sons, that we favor revising the rule instead
of just junking it. A University is expected to
toe a narrow line where morality is con
cerned. And the Administration feels that a
rule of this kind is needed as a well-deline
ated moral standard to help girls judge what
kind of conduct is considered acceptable.
Practicality is another factor. Women can
expect privacy to study in the living room in
their pajamas after 10.30—0r midnight on week
ends. Is it fair to deny men the same privilege?
Therefore, we would favor a new rule like
the one the Fundamental Standard Committee

needs to for public relations.
We believe the lone woman rule as it now
stands makes no contribution to morality not
already covered by the Fundamental Standard.
If a girl enters a man's house for an immoral
purpose, she is breaking the Fundamental
Standard whether or not the specific rule exists.
Hut it is because of the second—the public
relations — consideration, among other rea
sons, that we favor revising the rule instead
of just junking it. A University is expected to
toe a narrow line where morality is con
cerned. And the Administration feels that a
rule of this kind is needed as a well-deline
ated moral standard to help girls judge what
kind of conduct is considered acceptable.
Practicality is another factor. Women can
expect privacy to study in the living room in
their pajamas after 10.30—0r midnight on week
ends. Is it fair to deny men the same privilege?
Therefore, we would favor a new rule like
the one the Fundamental Standard Committee
recommends: "A Stanford woman may be in
the social area of a man's residence, on or off
campus, until 10:30 p.m. On campus she may
remain until 12 midnight Friday and Saturday
nights."
The committee defines the "social area" as
"the living, study, or recreation area, not the
area of retirement." Their report on the subject
further explains, "Infractions of this policy are
subject to the interpretation of Women's Coun
cil. Bases for judgment and penalty decision
shall be: (1) behavior and conduct of the in
dividual in regards to application of the Funda
mental Standard; (2) violation of the time limi
tation."
We hope the women of Stanford will
choose neither to retain a rule which seems
to v.s much in need of change nor to com
pletely abandon the rule. We hope they will
choose to move ahead with a more practical,
more enlightened form of the regulation.
