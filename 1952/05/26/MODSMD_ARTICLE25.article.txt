# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
On Paul

And it came to Stanford.
America's newest and goofiest fad, the panty raid,
ruifled Stanford's dignity Wednesday night. It hit
like a tornado and left in its wake a scattering of
women's garments and the hottest conversation piece
.since the Indians beat SC in football.

The fore-warner of this event
was Maizie May. a pint-sized
bundle of energy from Elm. She
;>ot word of the raid on Tuesday
night and she felt it her duty to
caution the Farm women popula
tion about this.
Maizie, the women's answer to
Paul Revere, hopped on her bike
and was so carried away by the
excitement of it all that she
bumped smack into a tree. A

Madrono girl, seeing a dazed Maizie picking herself
up from the ground, asked, "What is it, Maizie?"
"The raiders, they're coming," panted Maizie.
"Warn Madrono. Haven't got any time to talk. Have
to warn everyone else."
With which Maizie Revere peddled off to finish her
historic mission. By all means, the Red Coats (with
leather sleeves and "Stanford" written across the
chest) must be thwarted.
That was Tuesday, The actual event took place on
Wednesday, an event which incidentally, the ad
ministration and a good per cent of the Farm student
I,oily isn't too happy about. Certainly, the name of
Stanford and colleges in general aren't enhanced by
the act. There is never any excuse in doing damage,
and the whole idea is unoriginal and rather senseless.
However, of the 400 or so who watched the pro
ceedings, no more than GO ever entered one of the
beseiged residences or ever intended to. Also, 1 sup
pose one has to have some sympathy with the stu
dent who said, "Well, you only do a crazy thing once
in your life. This had to be it." It might have been
fun to do, but the public relations aspect of the metis
isn't very good.
♦ * *
But whatever may be taid, pro and con, I submit

that a panty raid' is a rather trying experience from
a reporter's point of view. One couldn't write down
a notation without being cuffed on the neck by two
Maidenlorms thrown from windows. Or being draped
in a slip that someone parachuted down lrom the
second floor of Roble.

SPRING SING NOTES. Stanford's most indispen
sable tradjtion next to the Big Game, the Spring Sing,
went off according to schedule last 1' > iday. And also
according to schedule, the Med School walked oil
with their umpteenth straight sweepstakes.
Union and Manzanita were positively racey in
their rendition of "Scottish Pipers," and Madrono
and SAE were professionally precise in "Come Thou,
Holy Spirit."
Jordan House and the Dolts' ' Anything You Can
Do I Can Do Better" was clever, although they missed
out in not taking advantage of Terry Evans' unique
voice. The Chappie made an appearance in the Sing,
and to the amazement of nobody, continued their
unblemished record of unsuccess.
The Hindustani students, with Professor Spiegel
berg reported to be singing second tenor, deserved
the award they received as did the Phi Sigs.
However, I think that Durand and the Chi Psi s,
singing "The Three Bells," were aced out ol an award
somewhere along the line. Storey and the Kappa Sigs
were ear-pleasing in "It's a Grand Night for Singing,
and one of the best presentations of the night was
"The Riff Song," as vocalized by the Betas.
The Alpine Club, sMg'.ng several mountain se
lections. should have stayed <>h the mountains to do
it and Casa Espanola and the Spanish Department
Boys were Hat hut enthusiastic.
Also deserving of mention was AKL in "Pore Jud
Is Daid," Elm and Theta Chi in "Daddy's Little Girl,"
the Phi Delts in "Winter Song," the Kappa Sig quin
tet in "Lindy Lou," Poth and Theta Xi in "Daddy's
Little Girl," Branner in "Waltz of the Flowers," and
Roble in "Long Ago and Far Away."
Dave Carr was great as the master of ceremonies,
although someone made the unpardonable sin of not
instructing Carr to conclude with the Stanford Hymn.
Well, no one can say that the year isn't coming to
a climactic end, what with Paul Reveres, Maiden
forms, and Spring Sings occupying headlines.

SPRING SING NOTES. Stanford's most indispen
sable tradjtion next to the Big Game, the Spring Sing,
went off according to schedule last 1' > iday. And also
according to schedule, the Med School walked oil
with their umpteenth straight sweepstakes.
Union and Manzanita were positively racey in
their rendition of "Scottish Pipers," and Madrono
and SAE were professionally precise in "Come Thou,
Holy Spirit."
Jordan House and the Dolts' ' Anything You Can
Do I Can Do Better" was clever, although they missed
out in not taking advantage of Terry Evans' unique
voice. The Chappie made an appearance in the Sing,
and to the amazement of nobody, continued their
unblemished record of unsuccess.
The Hindustani students, with Professor Spiegel
berg reported to be singing second tenor, deserved
the award they received as did the Phi Sigs.
However, I think that Durand and the Chi Psi s,
singing "The Three Bells," were aced out ol an award
somewhere along the line. Storey and the Kappa Sigs
were ear-pleasing in "It's a Grand Night for Singing,
and one of the best presentations of the night was
"The Riff Song," as vocalized by the Betas.
The Alpine Club, sMg'.ng several mountain se
lections. should have stayed <>h the mountains to do
it and Casa Espanola and the Spanish Department
Boys were Hat hut enthusiastic.
Also deserving of mention was AKL in "Pore Jud
Is Daid," Elm and Theta Chi in "Daddy's Little Girl,"
the Phi Delts in "Winter Song," the Kappa Sig quin
tet in "Lindy Lou," Poth and Theta Xi in "Daddy's
Little Girl," Branner in "Waltz of the Flowers," and
Roble in "Long Ago and Far Away."
Dave Carr was great as the master of ceremonies,
although someone made the unpardonable sin of not
instructing Carr to conclude with the Stanford Hymn.
Well, no one can say that the year isn't coming to
a climactic end, what with Paul Reveres, Maiden
forms, and Spring Sings occupying headlines.

And it came to Stanford.
America's newest and goofiest fad, the panty raid,
ruifled Stanford's dignity Wednesday night. It hit
like a tornado and left in its wake a scattering of
women's garments and the hottest conversation piece
.since the Indians beat SC in football.

The fore-warner of this event
was Maizie May. a pint-sized
bundle of energy from Elm. She
;>ot word of the raid on Tuesday
night and she felt it her duty to
caution the Farm women popula
tion about this.
Maizie, the women's answer to
Paul Revere, hopped on her bike
and was so carried away by the
excitement of it all that she
bumped smack into a tree. A

Madrono girl, seeing a dazed Maizie picking herself
up from the ground, asked, "What is it, Maizie?"
"The raiders, they're coming," panted Maizie.

SPRING SING NOTES. Stanford's most indispen
sable tradjtion next to the Big Game, the Spring Sing,
went off according to schedule last 1' > iday. And also
according to schedule, the Med School walked oil
with their umpteenth straight sweepstakes.
Union and Manzanita were positively racey in
their rendition of "Scottish Pipers," and Madrono
and SAE were professionally precise in "Come Thou,
Holy Spirit."
Jordan House and the Dolts' ' Anything You Can
Do I Can Do Better" was clever, although they missed
out in not taking advantage of Terry Evans' unique
voice. The Chappie made an appearance in the Sing,
and to the amazement of nobody, continued their
unblemished record of unsuccess.
The Hindustani students, with Professor Spiegel
berg reported to be singing second tenor, deserved
the award they received as did the Phi Sigs.
However, I think that Durand and the Chi Psi s,
singing "The Three Bells," were aced out ol an award
somewhere along the line. Storey and the Kappa Sigs
were ear-pleasing in "It's a Grand Night for Singing,
and one of the best presentations of the night was
"The Riff Song," as vocalized by the Betas.
The Alpine Club, sMg'.ng several mountain se
lections. should have stayed <>h the mountains to do
it and Casa Espanola and the Spanish Department
Boys were Hat hut enthusiastic.
Also deserving of mention was AKL in "Pore Jud
Is Daid," Elm and Theta Chi in "Daddy's Little Girl,"
the Phi Delts in "Winter Song," the Kappa Sig quin
tet in "Lindy Lou," Poth and Theta Xi in "Daddy's
Little Girl," Branner in "Waltz of the Flowers," and
Roble in "Long Ago and Far Away."
Dave Carr was great as the master of ceremonies,
although someone made the unpardonable sin of not
instructing Carr to conclude with the Stanford Hymn.
Well, no one can say that the year isn't coming to
a climactic end, what with Paul Reveres, Maiden
forms, and Spring Sings occupying headlines.

On Paul

And it came to Stanford.
America's newest and goofiest fad, the panty raid,
ruifled Stanford's dignity Wednesday night. It hit
like a tornado and left in its wake a scattering of
women's garments and the hottest conversation piece
.since the Indians beat SC in football.

The fore-warner of this event
was Maizie May. a pint-sized
bundle of energy from Elm. She
;>ot word of the raid on Tuesday
night and she felt it her duty to
caution the Farm women popula
tion about this.
Maizie, the women's answer to
Paul Revere, hopped on her bike
and was so carried away by the
excitement of it all that she
bumped smack into a tree. A

Madrono girl, seeing a dazed Maizie picking herself
up from the ground, asked, "What is it, Maizie?"
"The raiders, they're coming," panted Maizie.
"Warn Madrono. Haven't got any time to talk. Have
to warn everyone else."
With which Maizie Revere peddled off to finish her
historic mission. By all means, the Red Coats (with
leather sleeves and "Stanford" written across the
chest) must be thwarted.
That was Tuesday, The actual event took place on
Wednesday, an event which incidentally, the ad
ministration and a good per cent of the Farm student
I,oily isn't too happy about. Certainly, the name of
Stanford and colleges in general aren't enhanced by
the act. There is never any excuse in doing damage,
and the whole idea is unoriginal and rather senseless.
However, of the 400 or so who watched the pro
ceedings, no more than GO ever entered one of the
beseiged residences or ever intended to. Also, 1 sup
pose one has to have some sympathy with the stu
dent who said, "Well, you only do a crazy thing once
in your life. This had to be it." It might have been
fun to do, but the public relations aspect of the metis
isn't very good.
