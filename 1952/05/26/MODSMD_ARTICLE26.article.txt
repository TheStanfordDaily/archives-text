## Stanford Conduct vs. Harvard, Yale 
### 
To (he Editor:
No one denies that (he recent "panty raid was
unfortunate publicity for our University. Several
persons, however, made statements in Friday's Daily
to the effect that there had been no preliminary warn
ing because "the calibre of the student body is sup
posed to be sufficiently high so as to rule out the
possibility of such mob violence . . Isn't it a little
pompous to expect Stanford people to conduct them
selves better than those at Harvard and Yale? Yet
both of these universities have experienced student
disorders within recent weeks, and both are famous

for their high standards. Immaturity and youthful
exuberance cause many freshmen anywhere to get
out of hand from time to time. It is the duty of the
powers-that-be to foresee the possibility of such an
outbreak and to quash it before it can gain headway.
The student government or the administration, reali
zing the implications of the nation-wide "panty fever,'
should have issued the simple, tactfully-worded state
ment that would surely have frustrated a local inci
dent immediately.
