## 
### DICK KLEIN

Unable to garner a first place, Stanford's thinclads still managed
to come in second in the Pacific Coast Conference track and field
finals at Eugene over the weekend. USC won with G2 1/ 2 points;
Stanford, 35; and Cal was third with 30",
The Trojan domination was complete as they captured seven

! first places and tied for another.
! Outstanding performers for SC were
i Sim Iness, the Tulare discuss
| tosser and ex-teammate of Bob Ma
' thias, and Jack Davis. Iness set a
! new collegiate record of 183' 5V4",
I while Davis won both the hurdles in
easy fashion.
Bob Mathias scored eight points
which was a fair performance for
| the Olympic decathlon king. He was
I a close second in the low hurdles and
I faltered to a third in the high sticks
after crashing into the seventh hur
j die in what could have been a close
race. The final point came in the
i discus. Bob was fifth with a heave
of IG4' 2". As in the shot, his timing
: was off and he fouled two of his final
j tosses on Saturday.
In the distance events, Bob Si
mon, Hob Reed, and Will King all
did about as well as could be ex
pected. Simon pushed hard against
a good headwind 011 the back
stretch to open up yardage on Art
Garcia, but the spunky Trojan had
too much left around the final turn
and won by a few feet. Coach Jack
Weiershauser caught Simon in
! 4:12.5.
In the two-mi'e, Reed in third
place did the eight laps in 9:27, not
his best but still okay for a l'rosh.
The amazing King did his best per
sonal best to finish fifth with a 9:35.
Charlie Hokanson topped his best
: heaves in the shot put as he caught
off three at 52'9." 52' 10," and 52'
II ,/ 4." The latter toss was good for
second. The other Card weightman,
Howie Hertz, came in for third.
! Chuck Renfro picked up two points
in the discus, placing ahead of Ma
i thias.
Other point-earners were Pete Mc-
Kay with an excellent leap of 23'
against a quartering wind, a
:48.8 quarter-mile by Fred George
behind a winning time of :48.4. and
a fourth in the javelin by Leo Long.
The final points were picked up
by the mile relay combo which
came in fourth behind SC. The |
Trojans ran the four laps in 3:16.5. i
Bob Simon, running the second lap ;
for (he Indians, toured the quar
ter in :51.1 which is good for a
miler.
The traveling Cards got back to
the Farm yesterday at noon. The ,
trip was pleasant all along the way. |
Housed at the Eugene Hotel, the Card
competitors were among the 110
athletes who stayed at the Oregon 1
hotel. After a little rest, the Cards
will begin workouts for the rest of
the track campaigns, including the
NCAA and AAU meets.
