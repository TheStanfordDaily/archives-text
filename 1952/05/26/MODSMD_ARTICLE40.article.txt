# Oarsmen Unlucky; Are Beaten By Bears
## 
### BOB MISHELL 
Bad luck in the form of a dropped oar hit the Stanford varsity
:rew Saturday as they were beaten by Cal in the second annual
Western Sprint Championships at Newport Beach. The mishap,
iinown in crew racing as a "crab," occurred near the midpoint of
he race when soph Bill Allen, rowing at third, failed to place

his oar directly into the water and"*
the momentum of the boat pulleJ
ihe oar from his hands.
Unfortunately for the Cards,
they failed to notice the accident
until the oar was trailing the shell
in the water. The oarsmen, who
had been trailing the Bears by a
scant third of a length when Allen
dropped his blade, fell four lengths
behind the Cal shell before they
could retrieve the oar. This yard
age loss, coupled with the fact that
Allen had to finish the race with a
twisted oarlock, gave the Bears all
the advantage they needed.
In the preliminary races, the
Cards easily swept past both Ore
gon State and UCLA by three
lengths. Their time of G:53.8 bet
tered Cal's prelim time by one-tenth
of a second, but the Bears won the
championship race in 6:46.8.
Coach Bob White was pleased
with the performance of the varsity,
who, aside from the "crab," indi
the highly touted Cal crew. With
regard to next Saturday's race with
on the Oakland Estuary, White
felt that the Indians could and
would beat the Bears. He said, "The
boys feel they can get those guys
next week. They're not scared of
them, anyway."
Coach Ky Ebright of Cal joined
White in his praise of the Card
crew. He said, "I don't doubt Stan
lord will give us a good race Sat
urday on the basis of what they
did today."
Saturday's contest marked the
first time the Indians hvae been
beaten this year. Cal has yet to be
defeated.
After next Saturday's "Big Race"
with Cal, the Indian oarsmen hope
to compete in the National Regatta
in June and the Olympic trials in
July if funds hold out.
Last Saturday's varsity racers
were: D;>ve Zherdman, coxswain;

Dewey Hecht, stroke; Jim Filer, No.
7; Bill Grenninger, No. 6; Jerry
Thayer, No. 5; Phil West, No. 4; Bill
Allen, No. 3; Sam Stenrs, No. 2;
and Ted Cannis, bow.
