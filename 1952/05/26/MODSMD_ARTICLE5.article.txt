Fresh Dan Osborne and Senior
Pete Cole, diver Bill (ilathc and
frosli backstroke? Larry Ileim.
Osborne and Cole battled for all
three distance events with the for
mer coming out on lop thrice. In
Thursday's 1500 it was a case of
Cole, hampered by a bad cold,
running out of gas with five hips
to go and Osborne sprinting on to
win in 1f>:14.1.
In Friday's 220 and Saturday's 440
the two tall, tanned Indians raced
neck and neck for the entire dis

a yard in both events.

mastery, easily beating his nearest
competitor, Cal's Jim Ross, in both
the 100 and 200.
His 2:12 1 clocking for the 200 was
