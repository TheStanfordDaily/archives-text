At a packed meeting ol all living group prcsi
dents yesterday afternoon, Drew Terramorne,
Chairman of the Council lor Student Control
(Men's and Women's Councils combined) pre
sented the council's determination of the respon-

sibility for last Wednesday night's
panty raids.
The council decided that the re
sponsibility for the raids and result
ing damages should be borne by the
living groups involved, as a whole.
Tcrramor.se outlined the following
program for the settlement of the
$700 damages:
1. Return of clothes: Mm who
took items of clothing may return
them to apply against the damage
charges until today noon. If ihc re

Dick Wcisinann and Wayne Al
loy, incoming and outgoing ASSU
presidents, were extremely morti
fied when they read of the panty
raids in the Seattle newspapers last
Thursday morning.
Weisimuin and Alley were in
Seattle attending a conference of
West Coast college student body
presidents.
Said Alley: "The type of pub
licity received has undoubtedly in
cited more raids than it prevented.
Students who participate are not
sensualists or criminals, but are
fools whose criticism should be the
laughter of our community."

claimed by its owners before 7 to
morrow night, its value will be ap
plied against the damage charges.
Freshmen should return clothing
to the Encina ofTicc; men of the Row,
Stern, or Toyon should return cloth
ing to the individual houses from
which it was taken.
2. Adjustment: Men's Row and
Encina shall be responsible for the
damages to Hurlburt House on a
50-. r )0 basis. Damages to Roble will
be shared 80% by the freshmen at
Encina and Toyon and 20% by the
Roble girls. Encina, Toyon, and
Stern will be equally responsible for
the payment of damages to Branner.
By Thursday morning the council
will inform each living group presi
dent of the difference between its
share of the damages and the value
of clothing returned; i.e., the amount
that must be paid.
The deadline for payments is noon
on Friday. Hall or wing treasuries
may not be used to make restitution;
the payments are to be made by in
dividuals.
Men who refuse to pay will not
be allowed to register fall quarter.
Presumably seniors will have their
graduation held up.
Of the $700 damages, $400 was done
to Roble, $100 to Branner, and $200
to Hurlburt.
Terramorse pointed out that the
Council decided on the group respon
sibility principle rather than a
"witch hunt" for guilty individuals
after a lengthy discussion and in
vestigation.
Immediately following the meeting
of living group presidents, IFC held
a short meeting to decide how to
apportion its $115 share of the re
sponsibility for repayment of panty
raid damages.
The fraternity presidents voted
almost unanimously to assess each
house an equal amount of the money.
