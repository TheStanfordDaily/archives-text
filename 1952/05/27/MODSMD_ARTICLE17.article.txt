# Where Oh Where to Park That Car?
## Police Blame Lazy Students 
### WALT WILLIAMS 
Any student who has tried to find
a parking space on Quad and has
ended up by being late for class
knows that Stanford is faced with a
shortage of campus parking spaces.
University officials, too, have recog
nized the shortage and arc working
to remedy the parking problem.
The Stanford Police Department
has registered more th;>n 4.000 cars
to students, faculty, and University
employees this year, and Polite Chief
Gordon Davis estimates that at least
3,600 of these have been parked on
campus at one time.
Adequate Space
Davis blamed the shortage of park
ing facilities on students living on
'campus who try to find a parking
spice closer to Quad rather than
walk the few blocks.
He said that adequate space is
available for Village and other off
campus students who must drive to
classes if those living on the Row and
in dormitories on campus would
leave their cars and walk to Quad.
Most of the parking violation tic
kets arc given to cars parked in
restricted spaces. These reserved

| areas a»"« marked, and include the
I Education Building lot, Serra St..
near History Corner, Lomita near
Physics Corner, and the lot east of
ihe University Press building. There
j are approximately 200 parking spaces
reserved on campus for faculty and
| the physically handicapped.
All parking fines arc $2 unless al
j lowed to become delinquent—after
; ten days—when another dollar over
due fee is levied.
M'»re Lois PI aimed
The Police Department and AI 112
[ Brandin, University Business Man-
J a Her, have recognized the serious
j ness of the present parking problem
j and have been checking the car reg
j istration lists as a gunge for the
I planning of future parking areas.
J The Stern Hall lot has been expanrl
iod this quarter, and several other
improvements will he made dur
ing the summer.
Because of a lack of finances and
the great increases in the number of
cars registered each year, the cstab
| lishment of new parking facilities on
j campus has been hasty and of a
temporary nature.
A system of permanent parking
areas to tie in with the master plan

| lished by the Planning Office is now
being set up as the best solution to
| the problem.


ANOTHER TICKET—A two-dollar fine is in store for the owner
of this car. A full-time patrolman is employed by the University
Police Department to issue parking violation tickets.

Any student who has tried to find
a parking space on Quad and has
ended up by being late for class
knows that Stanford is faced with a
shortage of campus parking spaces.
University officials, too, have recog
nized the shortage and arc working
to remedy the parking problem.
The Stanford Police Department
has registered more th;>n 4.000 cars
to students, faculty, and University
employees this year, and Polite Chief
Gordon Davis estimates that at least
3,600 of these have been parked on
campus at one time.
Adequate Space
Davis blamed the shortage of park
ing facilities on students living on
'campus who try to find a parking
spice closer to Quad rather than
walk the few blocks.
He said that adequate space is
available for Village and other off
campus students who must drive to
classes if those living on the Row and
in dormitories on campus would
leave their cars and walk to Quad.
Most of the parking violation tic
kets arc given to cars parked in
restricted spaces. These reserved

| areas a»"« marked, and include the
I Education Building lot, Serra St..
near History Corner, Lomita near
Physics Corner, and the lot east of
ihe University Press building. There
j are approximately 200 parking spaces
reserved on campus for faculty and
| the physically handicapped.
All parking fines arc $2 unless al
j lowed to become delinquent—after
; ten days—when another dollar over
due fee is levied.
