# Why Delays in Campus Housing?
## 
### 
The new housing policy for men, whereby
fiist quarter freshmen will live on campus, and
non-fraternity sophomores in the Village again
points up the problem of lack of adequate on
campus housing.
The new policy, despite complaints, is prob
ably the best that could be worked out. Some
group must be relegated to the Village, and no
matter which group it is, it has a legitimate
gripe. We feel it is v/ise to give frosh an on
c.arnpus first impression. But there is no reason
why, v/ith current plans to stabilize enrollment
at the present level, there should not be on
campus housing for all.
Money has been the perennial bind. But gov
ernment loans for such educational expansion
are available at low interest rates, with no
strings attached, and payable over a 40-year
period.
Careful planning is important. But it has
been going on for several years and should be
brought to fruition.
Right now, we're in a potentially dangerous
housing position. Stanford has been leasing the
Village, and permanent possession has never

been negotiated. With the Far Eastern situation
continuing unstable, it is not unlikely that the
army would resume possession and reconvert
to hospital facilities as in World War 11.
This sort of action would yank the rug from
under a sizable portion of the student body.
Neither existing facilities on campus or in the
Palo Alto area could begin to handle the dis
placed Villagers. Bluntly, we'd be in quite a
fix.
The unstable world situation also creates the
possibility of material shortages developing
and postponing,construction of campus dormi
tories for an unnecessary, undesirable length
of time.
Planning in terms of two or three years right
now seems unrealistic to us. Money is avail
able. Planning should be expedited and con
struction started in the immediate future.
We can avoid the difficulties of suddenly
removed Village housing and a long postpone
ment of campus construction because of ma
terial shortages. If we delay too long both of
these eventualities are not remote.
