## Voluntary Payments for Panty Raid 
### 
To the Editor:
After reading the reaction of the administration
officials, student body leaders, and the Daily editorial
of today, I am confident that the students responsible
for the Wednesday night punty-raid must have hung
their heads in shame. They must have realized the
utter foolishness which made them succumb to the
spring fever hysteria of some Eastern universities.
I believe it was just for the fun of seeing Stanford
in publicity which was responsible for this incident
and the feeling that they can also do it! They evi
dently did not wait to reflect upon the possible con
sequences that such action on their part would bear
upon the fair name of Stanford. They might have
argued "There are so many other schools where this
has not happened; why should Stanford be in the
background?"
it is bad enough publicity to fall prey to the mass
hysteria but something can always be done to counter
balance, the bad effects and in fact to substitute them
with good leadership. I appeal to the good sense of
those students who wanted furi and publicity (?) for
Stanford, and suggest that each individual who took
part in that raid send to the Excom anonymously a
sum of money worth the damage he considers him
self responsible for.
This voluntary action on the part of students, if
undertaken in good spirit, will go a long way not
only to counterbalance the mischief that has been
caused by this sad incident at Stanford, but will pro
vide the other schools with a leadership of which
every Stanfordite will feel proud.
