To the Editor:
Let me state at the outset that I am not a member,
nor have I ever been a member, nor do I contemplate
membership in the forces of darkness, represented by
the "childish, unoriginal, stupid, trite, thoughtless,
idiotic, unthinking, irresponsible, rash, immature, dis
graceful impetuous, moronic" (have I left anything
out?) lingerie looters. Neither am I formally associ
ated with the forces of light—l blush to confess it—
represented so ably by yourself, Miss Erwin, and
Messrs. Winbigler, Klein, Poze, Corr, Mitchell, Sabin,
et al. Iri briefs, I have no axe to grind with regard
to the chemise sorties of last Wednesday night.
Ail 1 know about the controversy over dishabille
despoliation is what I have read in The Daily's pages.
Perhaps the 100% Stanfordians have some convincing
arguments, but all I have read from them so far has
I een specious, stodgy, anil sanctimonious. I would
be worried over the ascendancy of the cult of ortho
doxy were it not for my conviction that efforts to make
colleges and universities the counterparts of outside
communities will invariably fail. I shall begin to
worry only when the public ceases to refer to us
as "crazy mixed-up kids."
