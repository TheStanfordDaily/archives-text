# More on Panty Raid

To Ronald Poze, Bill Corr, Jim Mitchell, Cullen Sabin
A Co. and anyone else of the same opinion:
The overemphasis on the seriousness of the panty
raid Is absurd and shows greater immaturity than did
the panty raid itself. We don't understand how you
could have written with a straight face the letters
that appeared in Friday's Daily.
As long as colleges have existed, actions based on
mob psychology, such as panty raids, have occurred.
These actions have always caught the public's eye,
and have been greatly publicized in newspapers and
magazines. Most people consider Yale, Princeton, and
Harvard the "big three" universities of America.
These colleges are the most notorious in the country
for mob demonstrations, and no one re::pects them any

the less as cultural centers. If public opinion caused
lÂ»y these demonstrations were nearly us bad us you
seem to think, these universities, and a good many
others, could be closed today.
The article on panty raids which appeared in LIFE
this week is typical of the sort of publicity college
pranks receive throughout the country. People read
ing such an article do not .1) Vow never to let their
son attend that college 2) Tear up the check they had
been planning to donate, swearing they will not give
support to such lawlessness, or 3) Take out their
little black book and deftly scratch that college's name
off the list of socially acceptable institutions. They
chuckle as they put down the magazine, and they
think back to their college days, or, if they didn't go
to college, their youth. We are disgusted to read
such phrases as "I am ashamed to admit I am a Stan
ford student," "What chance has the June graduate
got of getting a job . . ." "One such incident can do
more harm to our public relations than winning the
Rose Bowl could possibly help them," and "Thank
God we're graduating before the whole student body
goes to pot."
The greatest criticism that can be held against the
parity raid is that it was un-original. As for the cost,
v/e got off lightly compared to the other schools where
raids have occurred. It would cost more than y'iOO
to give a beer blast for 500 people.
College fads, such us gold-fish swallowing, flag
pole sitting, and panty-raiding are a part of the tra
dition and heritage of American youth. llow can we
at Stanford say we are above this tradition and heri
tage? The way some Stanford graduates consider
themselves to be better than people from other uni
versities gives Stanford a much worse reputation than
any amount of panty-raiding could ever do. At Wed
nesday night's panty raid everyone, girls and police
included, had a lot of fun and no one was hurt.
As long as boys like girls, girls like boys, and young
people have red blood in their veins, actions such
as the panty raid will occur.
