# Those Sunday Flicks

To the Frlitor:
Flicks Are Better Than Ever!
Over the past year, we have derived a great deal of
pleasure from the old institution known hereabouts
as the Sunday Night Flick. The bill of fare has varied
from the musical comedy to the h?avy drama of Ham
let. Of late, however, a new trend has developed in
the type of movie offered. This new form of enter
tainment has been espcially satisfying as a respite
from the usual lackadaisical, and restful Sunday.
Week before last we were treated to the spectacle
of a pleasant young fellow having his head bashed in
with a boulder, as a French chef might pound a
steak. We particularly enjoyed the entrancing sight
of the tv/o prisoners' bodies being shuffled down the
staircase liberally laid with lacerations. A clever twist
was introduced at the finale when the two bodies were
swung from a nearby telephone pole.
Our highest expectations were surpassed this week,
however, when the fabulous "Fabiola" brought to us
the awe-inspiring carnal scenes of the lion-feeding
and Christian-burning flays of scenic old Pome. The
hand-chopping scene was 112 rough t. with emotion and
basic drama, but was outdone by the sight of a
fragile young blond being eaten by a lion.
We sincerely hope that similar care will be given
to the selection of our Sunday night entertainment in
the future and perhaps bring to us such interesting
and informative sights as lynching, the use of the
"iron-maiden," and other torture methods used to
terrorize undeserving victims.
