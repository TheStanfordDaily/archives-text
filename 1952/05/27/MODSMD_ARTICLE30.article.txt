# Ex-Gridder to Dance In Prokofieff Opera
## 
### CONNIE COMPERTS 
A 6-foot 4-inch ex-quarterback
and football coach doing a bal
let in an opera!
This might seem out of place
in most operas, but not in Pro
kofieff's i "The Love for Three
Oranges," the presentation of
the Music Department and the
Stanford Players scheduled for
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.
This show, in the words of Dr. F.
Cowlos Strickland, in charge ol
staging, is "corny, funny, silly, and
crazy." It is, us he explained, a
satire on other operas.
Ray Hammed, the former foot
hall player, portrays two roles:
the King and the Cook. It is in
the latter role that his ballet takes
place. Ray, a former Stanford
coach, does splits, pirouettes, and,
in the middle of his performance,
a set of football exercises!
Larry Mason, who plays the ro
mantic lead of the Prince, is, ac
cording to Dr. Strickland, one of
the few exceptions to Gilbert's say
ing about tenors: "When God gave
man a tenor voice, he thought he'd
done enough and he left the brains
out."
In his role as the Prince, Larry
sings one aria made up completely
of "Ha," a hilarious parody of op
eratic arias in general.
Eloise Farrell and Geri Wil
liams, hofli Stanford alumnae,
portray Fata Morgana, chief vil
lainess (there are four of them,
including magicians and sorcevess

es), and Princess Nineita, of (he
three oranges.
The members of the Stanford
Chorus who are participating in the
production literally have box seats
for the show. Boxes, resembling the
boxes found in old theaters, are be
ing constructed on either side of the
stage. Throughout the play, the
chorus sits and makes more or less
rude remarks on the action.
Two previous princesses, who
have emerged from their oranges,
have already died for lack of wa
ter. As the last princess is about
to die in the best operatic tradi
tion, a chorus member puts a pail
of water on the stage, thus saving
the life of the princess and mak
ing a happy ending possible.
The musical score l'or the opera
is considered by many experts one
of the wittiest and most difficult
ever written. Prokofieff has the or
chestra carry out the satire, writing
for it a theme containing strains of
Puccini, Verdi, Debussy, and Wag
ner.
Tickets for the three perform
ances are on .'.ale nt the Memorial
Theater box office for $1 each.


PRINCE'S COMPANIONâ€”Joe Tissier, one of the featured play
ers in the opera "The Love For Three Oranges," portrays the
role of Trouffaldino, the Prince's friend who accompanies him
on his many adventures. Tissier and many other talented sing
ers may be seen Thursday, Friday and Saturday when Prokof
fieff's satiric opera is presented by the Stanford Music Depart
ment and the Stanford Players. Tickets for the three perform
ances are on sale for $1.00 at the Memorial Theatre box office.
