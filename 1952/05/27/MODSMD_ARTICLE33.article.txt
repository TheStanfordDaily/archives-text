# Mathias to Try for 2nd Olympic Crown
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
In two months, a tall, quiet young man of 21, a man somewhat
lesembling a statue of a Greek God, will mount the gangplank of
a ship bound for Europe. A week or so later, this same young man
will find himself in a huge stadium in Helsinki, Finland, once more
(oinpeting for the greatest honor an athlete can receive, one he
has already received before — the*

Olympic Decathlon championship.
This man is a Stanford undergrad
uate known t>> the world as Robert
Mathias; the same Robert Mathias
lliut came as a high school hoy to
the M)4H Olympics and outpointed
the world's best athletes for his first
Olympic crown.
At present "Big Bob,'' "Rapid Rob
ert," "The Tulare Flash," or whatever
you may wish to call him is preping
for what may well be the greatest
two days of his life. No man has
ever taken two Olympic Decathlons
Mr. Mathias plan.-: to be the first.
Major obstacles to his plans will
be one Bob Richards, the pole vault
er and sprinter, and one Bill Albans,
i printer and hurdler. Regardless of
tht ir abilities in their specialties, Bob
is still the best ten event man in the
world.
World's Greatest Athlete
In the words of the University of
California and Olympic Team track
coach, Brutus Hamilton, Bob i.s "just
the world's greatest athlete."
To keep this position, tile big man
is working hard to get in shape for
ihe multitude of events he must
nut- ter for the Olympics. In lf)4«,
hi- worst comparative time was in

the gruelling 1500 meter race, 120
yards short of a mile.
His conditioning for this race i.s
one of his most serious problems.
Thus, for the h.st week and for the
next few weeks, Bob will be running
880's and 1320's in practice. To get
his stride and wind, he often jogs a
furlong, then opens up for a furlong
in practice for the 400 meters (440
yards) race.
His form to date shows that he
needs little practice in the other run
ning events — the 100 meters (ap
proximately 110 yards) and the 110
meters (approximately 120 yards)
high hurdles.
Against John George, Cal's ace
sprinter, in the Fresno Relays, Bob
didn't give an inch. By Olympics
time, he might be down close to the
:10.(>5 thousand point mark in the 100
meters. This is just a little below an
equivalent :9.7 hundred.
Cracking the Thousand Mark
In the high sticks, he has already
reeled off a : 14.3, which matches the
thousand point mark.
Six of the ten events are field
events, namely the broad jump, high
jump, pole vault, discus, javelin, and
shot put. He works out regularly in
all of these but the broad jump, and
plans to start working on that alter
the PCC finals on May 24.
In the discus, his all time best of
173* 4" is well above the thousand
point mark of 108 feet, but lie will
have to be in top shape to equal that
mark.
His shot put best is about one foot
off the 1000 mark, while his high
jump best of G' 3" is two inches off.
In the broad jump, his 23' 3%" best
is about a foot and a half off. His
javelin best of 182' best is nowhere
near the impossible 234 foot thou
sand point line.
Fourteen feet three inches is the
thousand point line in the polevault,
and Bob has vaulted 13 feet so far
this year. It might be added that he
has never tried for higher, and hasn't
been working out in the vault in
practice.
As long as he has two legs and two

arms in working condition (one
might do), the big man with the
crew haircut looks like a sure in in
his second straight Decathlon title.
Men like Richards and Albans might
come close, but it will take some
superman emerging from behind the
iron curtain to take him, and even
then you can't be sure.
In two months, a tall, quiet young man of 21, a man somewhat
lesembling a statue of a Greek God, will mount the gangplank of
a ship bound for Europe. A week or so later, this same young man

yards short of a mile.
His conditioning for this race i.s
one of his most serious problems.
Thus, for the h.st week and for the
next few weeks, Bob will be running
880's and 1320's in practice. To get
his stride and wind, he often jogs a
furlong, then opens up for a furlong
in practice for the 400 meters (440
yards) race.
His form to date shows that he
needs little practice in the other run
ning events — the 100 meters (ap
proximately 110 yards) and the 110
meters (approximately 120 yards)
high hurdles.
Against John George, Cal's ace
sprinter, in the Fresno Relays, Bob
didn't give an inch. By Olympics
time, he might be down close to the
:10.(>5 thousand point mark in the 100
meters. This is just a little below an
equivalent :9.7 hundred.
Cracking the Thousand Mark
In the high sticks, he has already
reeled off a : 14.3, which matches the
thousand point mark.
Six of the ten events are field
events, namely the broad jump, high
jump, pole vault, discus, javelin, and
shot put. He works out regularly in
all of these but the broad jump, and
plans to start working on that alter
the PCC finals on May 24.
In the discus, his all time best of
173* 4" is well above the thousand
point mark of 108 feet, but lie will
have to be in top shape to equal that
mark.
His shot put best is about one foot
off the 1000 mark, while his high
jump best of G' 3" is two inches off.
In the broad jump, his 23' 3%" best
is about a foot and a half off. His
javelin best of 182' best is nowhere
near the impossible 234 foot thou
sand point line.
Fourteen feet three inches is the
thousand point line in the polevault,
and Bob has vaulted 13 feet so far
this year. It might be added that he
has never tried for higher, and hasn't
been working out in the vault in
practice.
As long as he has two legs and two

arms in working condition (one
might do), the big man with the
crew haircut looks like a sure in in
his second straight Decathlon title.
Men like Richards and Albans might
come close, but it will take some
superman emerging from behind the
iron curtain to take him, and even
then you can't be sure.
In two months, a tall, quiet young man of 21, a man somewhat
lesembling a statue of a Greek God, will mount the gangplank of
a ship bound for Europe. A week or so later, this same young man
will find himself in a huge stadium in Helsinki, Finland, once more
(oinpeting for the greatest honor an athlete can receive, one he
has already received before — the*

Olympic Decathlon championship.
This man is a Stanford undergrad
uate known t>> the world as Robert
Mathias; the same Robert Mathias
lliut came as a high school hoy to
the M)4H Olympics and outpointed
the world's best athletes for his first
Olympic crown.
At present "Big Bob,'' "Rapid Rob
ert," "The Tulare Flash," or whatever
you may wish to call him is preping
for what may well be the greatest
two days of his life. No man has
ever taken two Olympic Decathlons
Mr. Mathias plan.-: to be the first.
Major obstacles to his plans will
be one Bob Richards, the pole vault
er and sprinter, and one Bill Albans,

is still the best ten event man in the
world.

His shot put best is about one foot
off the 1000 mark, while his high
jump best of G' 3" is two inches off.
In the broad jump, his 23' 3%" best
is about a foot and a half off. His
javelin best of 182' best is nowhere
near the impossible 234 foot thou
sand point line.
Fourteen feet three inches is the
thousand point line in the polevault,
and Bob has vaulted 13 feet so far
this year. It might be added that he
has never tried for higher, and hasn't
been working out in the vault in
practice.
As long as he has two legs and two

arms in working condition (one
might do), the big man with the
crew haircut looks like a sure in in
his second straight Decathlon title.
Men like Richards and Albans might
come close, but it will take some
superman emerging from behind the
iron curtain to take him, and even
then you can't be sure.
In two months, a tall, quiet young man of 21, a man somewhat
lesembling a statue of a Greek God, will mount the gangplank of
a ship bound for Europe. A week or so later, this same young man
will find himself in a huge stadium in Helsinki, Finland, once more
(oinpeting for the greatest honor an athlete can receive, one he
has already received before — the*

Olympic Decathlon championship.
This man is a Stanford undergrad
uate known t>> the world as Robert
Mathias; the same Robert Mathias
lliut came as a high school hoy to
the M)4H Olympics and outpointed
the world's best athletes for his first
Olympic crown.
At present "Big Bob,'' "Rapid Rob
ert," "The Tulare Flash," or whatever
you may wish to call him is preping
for what may well be the greatest
two days of his life. No man has
ever taken two Olympic Decathlons
Mr. Mathias plan.-: to be the first.
Major obstacles to his plans will
be one Bob Richards, the pole vault
er and sprinter, and one Bill Albans,
i printer and hurdler. Regardless of
tht ir abilities in their specialties, Bob
is still the best ten event man in the
world.
World's Greatest Athlete
In the words of the University of
California and Olympic Team track
coach, Brutus Hamilton, Bob i.s "just
the world's greatest athlete."
To keep this position, tile big man
is working hard to get in shape for
ihe multitude of events he must
nut- ter for the Olympics. In lf)4«,
hi- worst comparative time was in

the gruelling 1500 meter race, 120
yards short of a mile.
His conditioning for this race i.s
one of his most serious problems.
Thus, for the h.st week and for the
next few weeks, Bob will be running
880's and 1320's in practice. To get
his stride and wind, he often jogs a
furlong, then opens up for a furlong
in practice for the 400 meters (440
yards) race.
His form to date shows that he
needs little practice in the other run
ning events — the 100 meters (ap
proximately 110 yards) and the 110
meters (approximately 120 yards)
high hurdles.
Against John George, Cal's ace
sprinter, in the Fresno Relays, Bob
didn't give an inch. By Olympics
time, he might be down close to the
:10.(>5 thousand point mark in the 100
meters. This is just a little below an
equivalent :9.7 hundred.
Cracking the Thousand Mark
In the high sticks, he has already
reeled off a : 14.3, which matches the
thousand point mark.
Six of the ten events are field
events, namely the broad jump, high
jump, pole vault, discus, javelin, and
shot put. He works out regularly in
all of these but the broad jump, and
plans to start working on that alter
the PCC finals on May 24.
In the discus, his all time best of
173* 4" is well above the thousand
point mark of 108 feet, but lie will
have to be in top shape to equal that
mark.
His shot put best is about one foot
off the 1000 mark, while his high
jump best of G' 3" is two inches off.
In the broad jump, his 23' 3%" best
is about a foot and a half off. His
javelin best of 182' best is nowhere
near the impossible 234 foot thou
sand point line.
Fourteen feet three inches is the
thousand point line in the polevault,
and Bob has vaulted 13 feet so far
this year. It might be added that he
has never tried for higher, and hasn't
been working out in the vault in
practice.
As long as he has two legs and two

arms in working condition (one
might do), the big man with the
crew haircut looks like a sure in in
his second straight Decathlon title.
Men like Richards and Albans might
come close, but it will take some
superman emerging from behind the
iron curtain to take him, and even
then you can't be sure.
