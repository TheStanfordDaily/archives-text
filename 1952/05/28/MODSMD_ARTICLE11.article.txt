## Encina and Roble Revise Raid Damage Payments 
### 
Encina wing presidents and Roble
corridor presidents met last night
at Roble and readjusted the propor-.
tions of damage responsibility the
two freshman halls will bear for
last Wednesday night's panty raid
damage to Roble.
The new ratio is 70 per cent for
Encina and IK) per cent for Roble

compared to the preliminary 80-20
per cent ratio set by the Council
for Student Control.
The basis for arriving at the re
vised ratio of reimbursement was to
make the per-capita assessment ap
proximately equal for all members
of the freshman class.
Latest reports last night indicated
that only a small part of the cloth
ing teized last Wednesday had been
returned by yesterday noon's dead
line.
Roble Hall reported approximate
ly one-third of the clothing re
turned. Branrier's figure was 20 per
cent. Hurlburt's report ran less
than 20 per cent.
This indicated that actual assess
ments will be somewhat lets than
the total initial value of the clothing
damages. Property damage, how
ever, will have to be paid for in
full.
Revised charges are $400 for Ro
ble, including $150 in property dam
age; $40 for Branner; and $240 for
Hurlburt including about $10 in
physical damage.
The actual assessments will not be
known until tonight after the dead
line for claiming returned clothing
is passed.
Payments must be made by Fri
day noon. Wing and house funds
can be used.
