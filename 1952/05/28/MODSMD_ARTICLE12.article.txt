## 
### 
Panty raids arc increasing the
chances of a crackdown on college
draft rules, predicted U.S. News and
World Report this week.
The magazine said:
"Panty raids on college campuses
are bringing up two questions in
the minds of some officials in Wash
ington: how many 'raiders' arc
going to college with draft defer
ment? And why aren't they in the
Army if they have so much energy
and so little to do?"
They explained. "Deferments go
to any student who keeps hi.s grades
and conduct, up to standard, or who
makes a high score on a mental test,
or who joins the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps. Nobody is barred.
The student of music can be de
ferred as easily as the student of en
gineering.
"A student loses his deferment,
too, unless his college certifies to his
draft board that he Is in good stand
ing. Many college authorities made
it clear that leaders of panty raids
are in uncertain standing at best."
Local ROTC authorities in several
places have also warned that ROTC
trainees caught in panty raids may
face discharge.
The magazine citcd as examples
of the raids those at Stanford. Mis
souri. Vermont, and Tennessee, then
added. "Deferments weren't designed
for such goings on."
'"The liberal rules were expected
to be tightened a bit this summer
anyway if draft calls rise as sharply
as the Defense Department predicts
they will. Incidents like the panty
raids increase the chances for a real
crackdown."
