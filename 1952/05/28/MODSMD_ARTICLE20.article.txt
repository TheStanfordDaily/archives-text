## China Quivers In Uncertainty 
### 
Although the Chinese Communists
have done much to build \jp the
country, their system has many de
fects; and they are liable to run
into some difficulties.
This is how Dr. Shan Wing Chan,
professor of Chinese, described the
present Chinese situation to last
night's Tuesday Evening Series
audience in Memorial Auditorium
in a tall; entitled "Glimpses of Red
China.''
"The vast majority of the Chinese
people seem to thrive in uncertainty,
fear, and total submission," he ex
plained. They have suffered too
much from the destruction and de
privation of prolonged warfare. Now
they live on in silence—the silence
of resentment."
On the good side the Reds have
carried out extensive economic re
covery by restoring industries and
building up agriculture. Also they
are building an artificial harbor in
northern China, said Dr. Chan.
A very autocratic system, how
ever. has been the program of land
reforms, in which all land belong
ing to "exploiting" landlords is
being redistributed among the
peasants. Thought control, accord
ing to Dr. Chan, is so strict that
people must constantly laud Lenin,
Stalin, and Mao.
"It is not only freedom of speech
that is lacking, but also freedom of
silence," he said.
Dr. Chan likened the present situ
ation to the Chin dynasty centuries
ago. which started out on similar
policies and ended later in complete
collapse. He wonders if this can
happen again.
