## Protesting Panty Raid Fine Collections 
### 
To the Editor:
I should like to protest the action of Men's and
Women's councils in regard to the collection oi fines
to cover damages done during the recent punty raid.
1 feel tliut their method of collection, from the
pockets of all undergraduate men living on campus,
and from Roble women, is extremely unfair. II we are
forced to pay a fine in this manner, we are forced to
tacitly admit guilt in this affair. For many of us this
would he untrue. Why may we not act as a part of
a group, and use wing funds to pay our line? Why
must the innocent be punished as individuals?
Furthermore, 1 think that the Councils have made
a grave omission in not applying the Fundamental
f.tandard to the collection of these lines. II the guilty

were ordered to pay an assessment 01, say, two dol
lars, the hill should be amply paid. This need not be
done by name. It could he handled anonymously. II
it is felt that such a method is idealistic, then let the
K.A.'s in each living group question each person in the
wing. Under the Fundamental Standard a truthful
answer must be given. The only excuse for not doing
this would be that the raid itself is a Standard viola
tion, and, if so, all connected with it are liable to
expulsion. This has not been stated by either Council.
If the Standard i:; r.oo nebulous to apply here, or it
the Councils are afraid to apply it, then it, is un
realistic, and should be junked. I for one would hate
to see this happen.
