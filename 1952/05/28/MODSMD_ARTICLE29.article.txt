### KIP TODD 
Sam :nnl llie Little Man

The man across the room laughed and threw a rock.
The man's name was Sam World. Mankind was his
middle name, and his mother's name had been Nature.
Large he was, and stout. Many years of eating and
living had brought this on. Sam was no longer the
Being born, he was Sam World, hard, living, eating,
loving. But he threw rocks. The little man across
from him ducked and shivered. The gash across the
little man's chest showed through the clothing he
v/ore. Sam smiled and let the little man know ihat
there was nothing that didn't mean old thini»s 1.0 him.

"1 m tough!" Sam said. He said it
through the air as if there were
perspiration on every word that
he spoke.
"T<et me be!" cried the little
man. "Let nie alone. Take me
l ack to my warm womb anil let
me stay there knowing nothing,
letting only the image of good be
my friend."
"Like hell 1 will," said Sam.
"Nothing could make me change

now. Anil do you know what, my little man? Again
Sam threw a rock. It glanced lrom the- chest ol the
little man and fell to the floor with a bang. Perhaps
it .should not have been, but the rock was bloody.
Bloody, though, before it hit the little man, and
would never be a rock again.
The little man obviously did not know what.
Wavering, trying to find a way from the room, the
little man shivered, though the room was warm.
Smoke came in through the window, and the fire
outside, which usually burned, showed no sign of
going out. The little man actually did not care about
the fire, for it had been his life for as long as he could
remember. For years he had poured water upon what
he thought had been the fire, only to find that he
poured it on himself. "Can't you see that I m not
wanted here?" the little man asked.
"Didn't you read Time Magazine, you little fool?
Shut up. You can't think. I'm the only person who
knows what's good for you, and I m the only per on
who can take care of you." The little man didn't

believe him because he couldn't. Several thousand
years had gone by and he had been told to know him
self and find hiinselt and watch himself. He had bet n
told that life was to be lived as il it were a backdrop,
that the proof had been in himself; and he wondered
why someone had not told him before about Sam.
The little man stood still, his arms hanging down at
his sides and in his hands at the end of his arms was
nothing. His fingers were ink-stained, his nails were
long and brittle, there were no calluses on his hands
because he hail lound no reason to worry about cal
luses. And there was Sam waiting for an answer,
throwing rocks and smiling the smile of the satisfied.
"Yes," said the little man sadly. "1 know. At least
1 thought 1 knew. But what I knew didn't include you,
Sam, it included only me and my girl, me and my
mind, me and my God." The little man sidestepped
the rock that came at him. The little man smiled
sadly at Sam and wiped the grime of the fire from
his face.
"Don't call me Sam! Don't you know that your girl,
your mind, and your God are me?" Sam said this
slowly as il he did not understand the; stupidity ol
the little man. as if he did not know the little man at
all, but only his shadow. "Who are you, little man,
that you, a babe, a thing that 1 have never seen be
fore, can be my friend?" And Sam threw more rocks,
big rocks, and the little man wiped off the blood and
cried. "Look at me!" said Sam. "Look at rne, look at
my face. Must I tell you again that all of you is me?
Can you stand there crying, shivering, yet knowing
that your girl, your mind, and your God are me?"
Again the little man looked at Sam. His face, tear
stained, covered with smoke and soot, tried for the
first time since he was born, showed knowledge. The
little man had intelligence; he had himself. "Yes,"
He said again, "Yes. I know who you are, but I don't
think 1 want to. Must 1 see you there, must you throw
rocks, smile and ask me questions with no answers?"
"There is an answer, my boy," and Sam looked dif
ferent this time as he threw his rocks. "There is an
answer, but that answer is me, and the sooner you
learn it the better. Protection should end with the
womb and go no further, little man."
"Yes," said the liltle man this time again, and lie
meant it as lie wiped the blood from his eyes.

luses. And there was Sam waiting for an answer,
throwing rocks and smiling the smile of the satisfied.
"Yes," said the little man sadly. "1 know. At least
1 thought 1 knew. But what I knew didn't include you,
Sam, it included only me and my girl, me and my
mind, me and my God." The little man sidestepped
the rock that came at him. The little man smiled
sadly at Sam and wiped the grime of the fire from
his face.
"Don't call me Sam! Don't you know that your girl,
your mind, and your God are me?" Sam said this
slowly as il he did not understand the; stupidity ol
the little man. as if he did not know the little man at
all, but only his shadow. "Who are you, little man,
that you, a babe, a thing that 1 have never seen be
fore, can be my friend?" And Sam threw more rocks,
big rocks, and the little man wiped off the blood and
cried. "Look at me!" said Sam. "Look at rne, look at
my face. Must I tell you again that all of you is me?
Can you stand there crying, shivering, yet knowing
that your girl, your mind, and your God are me?"
Again the little man looked at Sam. His face, tear
stained, covered with smoke and soot, tried for the
first time since he was born, showed knowledge. The
little man had intelligence; he had himself. "Yes,"
He said again, "Yes. I know who you are, but I don't
think 1 want to. Must 1 see you there, must you throw
rocks, smile and ask me questions with no answers?"
"There is an answer, my boy," and Sam looked dif
ferent this time as he threw his rocks. "There is an
answer, but that answer is me, and the sooner you
learn it the better. Protection should end with the
womb and go no further, little man."
"Yes," said the liltle man this time again, and lie
meant it as lie wiped the blood from his eyes.

Sam :nnl llie Little Man

The man across the room laughed and threw a rock.
The man's name was Sam World. Mankind was his
middle name, and his mother's name had been Nature.
Large he was, and stout. Many years of eating and
living had brought this on. Sam was no longer the
Being born, he was Sam World, hard, living, eating,
loving. But he threw rocks. The little man across
from him ducked and shivered. The gash across the
little man's chest showed through the clothing he
v/ore. Sam smiled and let the little man know ihat
there was nothing that didn't mean old thini»s 1.0 him.

"1 m tough!" Sam said. He said it
through the air as if there were
perspiration on every word that
he spoke.
"T<et me be!" cried the little
man. "Let nie alone. Take me
l ack to my warm womb anil let
me stay there knowing nothing,
letting only the image of good be
my friend."
"Like hell 1 will," said Sam.
"Nothing could make me change

now. Anil do you know what, my little man? Again
Sam threw a rock. It glanced lrom the- chest ol the
little man and fell to the floor with a bang. Perhaps
it .should not have been, but the rock was bloody.
Bloody, though, before it hit the little man, and
would never be a rock again.
The little man obviously did not know what.
Wavering, trying to find a way from the room, the
little man shivered, though the room was warm.
Smoke came in through the window, and the fire
outside, which usually burned, showed no sign of
going out. The little man actually did not care about
the fire, for it had been his life for as long as he could
remember. For years he had poured water upon what
he thought had been the fire, only to find that he
poured it on himself. "Can't you see that I m not
wanted here?" the little man asked.
"Didn't you read Time Magazine, you little fool?
Shut up. You can't think. I'm the only person who
knows what's good for you, and I m the only per on
who can take care of you." The little man didn't

believe him because he couldn't. Several thousand
years had gone by and he had been told to know him
self and find hiinselt and watch himself. He had bet n
told that life was to be lived as il it were a backdrop,
that the proof had been in himself; and he wondered
why someone had not told him before about Sam.
The little man stood still, his arms hanging down at
his sides and in his hands at the end of his arms was
nothing. His fingers were ink-stained, his nails were
long and brittle, there were no calluses on his hands
because he hail lound no reason to worry about cal
luses. And there was Sam waiting for an answer,
throwing rocks and smiling the smile of the satisfied.
"Yes," said the little man sadly. "1 know. At least

"T<et me be!" cried the little
man. "Let nie alone. Take me
l ack to my warm womb anil let
me stay there knowing nothing,
letting only the image of good be
my friend."
"Like hell 1 will," said Sam.
"Nothing could make me change

now. Anil do you know what, my little man? Again
Sam threw a rock. It glanced lrom the- chest ol the
little man and fell to the floor with a bang. Perhaps
it .should not have been, but the rock was bloody.
Bloody, though, before it hit the little man, and
would never be a rock again.
The little man obviously did not know what.
Wavering, trying to find a way from the room, the
little man shivered, though the room was warm.
Smoke came in through the window, and the fire
outside, which usually burned, showed no sign of
going out. The little man actually did not care about
the fire, for it had been his life for as long as he could
remember. For years he had poured water upon what
he thought had been the fire, only to find that he
poured it on himself. "Can't you see that I m not
wanted here?" the little man asked.
"Didn't you read Time Magazine, you little fool?
Shut up. You can't think. I'm the only person who
knows what's good for you, and I m the only per on
who can take care of you." The little man didn't

believe him because he couldn't. Several thousand
years had gone by and he had been told to know him
self and find hiinselt and watch himself. He had bet n
told that life was to be lived as il it were a backdrop,
that the proof had been in himself; and he wondered
why someone had not told him before about Sam.
The little man stood still, his arms hanging down at
his sides and in his hands at the end of his arms was
nothing. His fingers were ink-stained, his nails were
long and brittle, there were no calluses on his hands
because he hail lound no reason to worry about cal
luses. And there was Sam waiting for an answer,
throwing rocks and smiling the smile of the satisfied.
"Yes," said the little man sadly. "1 know. At least
1 thought 1 knew. But what I knew didn't include you,
Sam, it included only me and my girl, me and my
mind, me and my God." The little man sidestepped
the rock that came at him. The little man smiled
sadly at Sam and wiped the grime of the fire from
his face.
"Don't call me Sam! Don't you know that your girl,
your mind, and your God are me?" Sam said this
slowly as il he did not understand the; stupidity ol
the little man. as if he did not know the little man at
all, but only his shadow. "Who are you, little man,
that you, a babe, a thing that 1 have never seen be
fore, can be my friend?" And Sam threw more rocks,
big rocks, and the little man wiped off the blood and
cried. "Look at me!" said Sam. "Look at rne, look at
my face. Must I tell you again that all of you is me?
Can you stand there crying, shivering, yet knowing
that your girl, your mind, and your God are me?"
Again the little man looked at Sam. His face, tear
stained, covered with smoke and soot, tried for the
first time since he was born, showed knowledge. The
little man had intelligence; he had himself. "Yes,"
He said again, "Yes. I know who you are, but I don't
think 1 want to. Must 1 see you there, must you throw
rocks, smile and ask me questions with no answers?"
"There is an answer, my boy," and Sam looked dif
ferent this time as he threw his rocks. "There is an
answer, but that answer is me, and the sooner you
learn it the better. Protection should end with the
womb and go no further, little man."
"Yes," said the liltle man this time again, and lie
meant it as lie wiped the blood from his eyes.

Sam :nnl llie Little Man

The man across the room laughed and threw a rock.
The man's name was Sam World. Mankind was his
middle name, and his mother's name had been Nature.
Large he was, and stout. Many years of eating and
living had brought this on. Sam was no longer the
Being born, he was Sam World, hard, living, eating,
loving. But he threw rocks. The little man across
from him ducked and shivered. The gash across the
little man's chest showed through the clothing he
v/ore. Sam smiled and let the little man know ihat
there was nothing that didn't mean old thini»s 1.0 him.

"1 m tough!" Sam said. He said it
through the air as if there were
perspiration on every word that
he spoke.
"T<et me be!" cried the little
man. "Let nie alone. Take me
l ack to my warm womb anil let
me stay there knowing nothing,
