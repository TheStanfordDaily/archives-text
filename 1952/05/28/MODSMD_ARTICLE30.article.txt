## West Berliner's Attitude Toward Soviets 
### 
(Editor's note: litis is lite second of two pails of
a letter from Pliil Nielsen, 'SI, ASSI exchange
scholar at The Free University of IJerlin.)
In West Berlin one finds bitter hatred of the Rus
sians, not so heavily directed against the Russian
"Volk" but only against Soviet Communists. Nu
merous middle aged Berliners with whom I have
spoken are rather belligerent and would be willing
once more to take up arms against the Russians, hut.
the opposite point of view is extremely prevalent
among students and young people, especially those
who served in the last war. The complete reversal
of Allied policy in the last year or so regarding
militarism in Germany strikes many young Germans
os quite ridiculous, although they generally agree
that Germany cannot remain a neutral factor in the
heart of Europe. Germans well realize that their
important strategic position and their industrial po
tential enable them to demand and receive eon
cessions from Western Powers which will restore and
further German national aims anil interests,
In fact, since my arrival in Berlin last October, I
have noted increasingly in newspapers, radio, public
rddresses, university lectures and daily conversation
in the street and at meal times a gradual reawakening
and consciousness of German nationalism, particu
larly concerning a unification of East and West Ger
many. Once more the word "Vaterland" moves tin
lips and emotions of the public. 1 doubt, however,
whether most West Berlin citizens understand on

account of the welter of propaganda- the assumptions
under which a peaceful unification of East anil West
Germany could take place. And whether, when West
Germany once again has its own army, the Soviet
Zone and the Territory east of the Oder-Neisse Line
can he regained without fores is, in my opinion, a
highly debatable topic.
Political feelings on this and related questions flared
up in both East and West Berlin on May Ist, Europe's
Labor Day. Huge demonstrations, parses, and street
battles on the sector borders brought into sharp reliel
the wide differences ol ideology and political action
programs of East and West. On the other side of the
Brandenburger Tor I saw thousands ol East Get man
youth little children marching, singing, clapping,
and shouting together amidst an atmosphere of red
banners, propaganda slogans, and gigantic portraits of
Stalin and Picck. The East spoke of freedom and
peace and at the same time accused the West of pre
pating for war and submitting to capitalistic ex
ploitation. But on the contrary, a few days later the
Minister President of the Soviet Zone called upon all
Germans to overthrow the Adenauer Federal Re
public if the General Treaty between West Germany
and the Alli-s is signed. Such policy and propaganda
disillusions the West and can only bring further
disappointments in the day-by-day political power
struggle in Germany.
Wishing you all my very best, I remain as always,
PHIL NIELSEN
