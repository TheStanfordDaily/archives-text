# Cal Election Termed Invalid--Vote Today
## 
### 
University of California students will go to the polls today in
presumably the final scene of one of the most hectic and weird
election dramas to ever unfold at the Berkeley campus.
The Bear students will vote for the second time to elect either
Richard Parker or Richard Holler as ASSU president.
Holler was first declared the winner of the position in the

original elections ten days ago. His 4
margin was ti) voles. A recount, i
however, shifted the lead to Parker,
who was declared president - elect
last Wednesday with a margin ol
[I'J votes.
Holler's eamp a i g n mumper,
Walt Anderson, immediately
lodged a |*r i»test, and Cal's exeoin
decided to throw out the election
altogether and hold a second vote
for the office today.
Investigation by the Student
Judicial Committee showed "no
evidence of actual fraud," hut
that fraud was a "physical pos
sibility."
Ballot boxes were left unguarded
lor several hours, during which they
could have been opened by readily
obtainable master keys. Numbers
hand-stamped on the ballots pos
sibly could have been duplicated.
And unused ballots were not imme
diately destroyed, but turned up all
over the place after the voting was
over.
The Daily California!) said that
in addition Elections Council was
badly understaffed, and called for
an "immediate and comprehen
sive" investigation of the election
procedure.
The Daily Cal and all other ASUC
publications, however, won their
own private election campaign.
Alter a stiff fight in which the op
position was led by the outgoing
ASUC president, a constitutional
amendment was approved by the
necessary two-thirds of the student
body giving control ol the publica
tions back to their editors.
The amendment restored the old
Publications Council and did away
with the controversial Daily Cul
Advisory Board.
