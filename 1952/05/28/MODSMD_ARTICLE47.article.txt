# Freshmen Reed and Brown Wow Stanford Sport Fans
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
One of the big breaks of the year
on the Stanford sport scene oc
curred when the NCAA moguls de
cided to allow freshmen to compete
in varsity competition this year.
First the ruhng gaze the iootball
team a lough, glue-fingered safety
man in Don Sanders, who anchored
one of America's best pass defenses.
Next it provided the basketball
team with a sharp-shooting wizard,
Ron Tomsic, who seems destined to
bteak all PCC scoring records in his
four-year stint.
This spring, two more frosh have
wowed Card fans, Bob Reed and
Fred Brown.
Reed is a squave-iawed lad who
fir.it gained attention by running
away from ail compettiion in bis
Oregon high - school meets. His
4:25 miles attracted every school
on the Coast, but naturally, as be
is a lad of perspicacity and high
intellectual character, he chose
Stanford.
At Stanford, he has astounded all.
In the mile, he blasted Chuck
Nimmo's long - standing Stanford
four-lap mark of 4:23.5. Reed has
pushed his time to consistently un
der 4:20. If he can beat the fresh
man mark as a freshman, it follows
he ought to lop the varsity mark of
4:11.5 sometime in his career.
His two-mile reocrd is even more
impressive. He has galloped the
eight-lap grind in 9:24.6. This time
just edges the former Card frosh
mark of 9:53. In addition, he is a
mere 2.8 seconds off the world
freshman mark set by Wes Santee,
Kan-as spectacular distance ace.
Santee now gallops 4:08 miles and
9:10 two-miles, winch is further
proof of the fantastic times Reed is
headed for.
This vear, lieed will be gun
ning for a berth on the Olympic
team in the 5,000 - meter event,
which is about three miles when
figured on a broken slide-rule.
The field is wide open, and Reed
finished third in a fair field at the
Fresno Relays in the time of 15:18.
Reed will have to get well under
15 minutes to see Europe free this
summer.
Reed has set 4:10 and 9:00 flat as
his goals in the distance jaunts. He
credits Coach Jack Weiershauser
with instilling a little confidence
in him. For his top thrill of the
year, he lists his upsetting of Occi
dental's renowned Bob McMillan in
the eight-lap grind. He made Mc-
Millan look sick.
Coach Weiershauser is vehement
in praise of the frosh ace. "Natu
| rally he rates as the greatest dis

tance prospect in the school's his
tory. He is the difference between
last year's team and this one," he
says, "but more than that he is a
coach's dream. His tireless deter
mination has been an inspiration to
all the men on the staff. He is al
ways willing to pace a team-mate
or help out in any way. Bob Ma
thias lias been the work-horse of
the team, and Reed has been the
spark-plug."
In contrast to Reed's grueling
exploits on the cinder - paths.
Brown's accomplishments on the
golf links have gone comparative
ly unnoticed.
In 11 dual meets, he ended up
shooting one over par goll. In two
heroic matches against San Jose
State's Ken Venluri. one of the best
amateurs in the world, Brown fired
a spectacular 05 and a wood 73,
while Venturi carded two G7'.s. Few
pros could have put on such a good
show. Brown has averaged undor
70 strokes a round in all compe
tition this year.
Brown is a Beverly Hills High
graduate. He grew up shooting the
Beile-Aire course, and this year in
a triumphant homecoming against
UCLA he defeated PCC champ and
National Public Links champ Dave
Stanley with a one-under-par ft!)
effort.
He just can't seem to lose. In the
1952 PCC's, where the pressure is
really on, his golden touch con
tinued. He came through with a
pair of par 71's to lead the Card
golfers to a championship and pn
all-time record low score.
Brown lists his beating of Venturi
as his top thrill. He credits his daily
practice on the tough Stanford
course with the improvement in hi.s
score.

Coach Bml Finffer that
"Brown is one of the greatest
18-year-old golfers in the world.
His final stature as a golfer will
depend on his determination and
practice in the next five years."
It's doubtful that even Brown will
be able to lead the Cards to a na
tional championship over North
Texas State, which has National
Amateur champ Billy Maxwell
shooting third man, but Brown says,
"If the team Â«gets hot, we'll do it."
Nobody dares to disagree with them.
