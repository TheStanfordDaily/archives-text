# Harriman Slaps Aid Cut in S.F. Address
## 
### HADLEY ROFF Daily Political Editor 
Gaunt, intellectual, and burning with idealism, W. Avcrell Har
riman visited San Francisco yesterday, trying to drum up support
tor his hid for the Democratic nomination.
Harriman seemed to vibrate with conviction that the present
foreign policy is the soundest possible.
In a speech to the Commonwealth Club at the Mark Hopkins

Hotel, the Mutual Security Admin-♦
istrator demanded that no cut be
made in the present foreign aid
program.
He decried the recent "slashing"
of foreign aid spending by the
House of Representatives. "We see
them recklessly endangering our
security," he complained.
"Actually, Congress is playing
down the road of the Kremlin," he
added vehemently.
Have Initiative
Harriman, who has been a lead- [
ing figure in the formation of for- J
eign policy, asserted that through i
such administrative programs as the I
Marshall Plan, Greek and Turkish j
aid, and NATO "we have assumed j
the initiative in international poli- j
tics that was once held by Russia." |
Harriman said the major issue of j
the 1952 campaign is that of restor- I
ing confidence in America's ability
to produce.
He lashed out at those who say
that the U.S. is nearing bankruptcy.
He said such thinking "has no va
lidity."
Citing current American produc- j
tion figures, Harriman said that "to
day we have the largest total in- I
dustrial output of our history."
' Our production can be boosted ;
even further," he claimed confi- !
dently.
Government Planning
But production boosts will stem
from government planning, he said.
The former vice-president of the
Union Pacific Railroad asserted that
the future of the nation no longer
rests witli industrialists.
It was not that he favors socialism,
he amended, but that he thought it
was the job of government to look
to the future and plan for the ex- i
pansion of American industry. He
said he did not sympathize with |
permanent government control of |
industry .
Increases, he implied, could be ,
absorbed by the underprivileged in
Asia and Europe. 4 •
Deficit Spending
Urging businessmen not to fear j
deficit spending. Harriman said thai [
♦he nation can sustain several more j
years of unbalanced budget. "Not j
that I don't, want to balance the I
budget,"he said. "But such a con
sideration shouldn't dominate our
thinking."
He said the U.S. should expert
sacrifices in the cold war. "I don't
believe the American people would
oppose higher taxes that would in- |
sure our security," he declared.
Harriman then turned to "creep- |
ing American isolationism." He 1
blasted those who advocate not aid- j
ing the allies, saying that, "such dis
regard of our international respon- j
sibilities' could prove "disastrous." j
Korean War
He said that the 16 United Nation.:, i
countries engaged in Korea are all
anxious to contribute their full share
of men and equipment. Many of ;
the nations, however, are unable to j
give ample support, Harriman said j
with a sad shake of the head. "Such ;
lack of strength has forced the U:S. j
to .shoulder mo t of the Korean
burden," lie said.
Harriman, his voice keen with
conviction, called for America to j
provide III" aid to strengthen alii';*. |
"so that our boys will never again |
h« confronted with a situation like I
Korea."
