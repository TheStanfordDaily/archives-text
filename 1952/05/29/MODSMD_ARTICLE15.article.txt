## 
### 
After weeks of study, the I undamenlal Stands rrj Committor
lias developed a broad elaboration of the Fundamental Standard
and more specific application of the Stanford to four "pioblem
areas."
Tlie Committee made its recommendations to Lxcom last night

♦in the form of a suggested social
booklet. Tlie four areas clarified
j are: liquor, student production ,
I student publications, and student
| affairs and dances. A suggested
I changc in the "lone woman rule"
was deleted from tlie original re
i port after ASSU President Wayne
Alley explaineH that a and

needed before Excom can a't on

The problem area clarification.
: were passed over .such objections a.
Colleen Daveney's that thr? Stand
ard would beonic weaker if pinned
1 down to specific points.
The following liquor section was
probably Iho most conrtoversi&l
"Liquor is » personal problem
Ihe question of ffriiikinu oi not
drinking, according to society,
