## Thesis Quoted In High Court 
### 
A Stanford student's thesis was
quoted extensively in the Supreme
Court's recent decision thai movies
are entitled to the const ituitonal
guarantees of free speech and free
press.
Gordon B. Greb, graduate student
now studying for his doctorate in
political science, argued in this
thesis that movies fall under ihe
free speech and press provisions of
the first amendment, and that the
1915 decision in Ohio film censorship
case which held movies to be a fc rm
of entertainment had in fact been
overruled by opinions banded flown
in later press cases.
Greb wrote the thesis al the Uni
versity of Minnesota after 18 months
of research in Hollywood and Man
Francisco: He is a former journalism
instructor and radio announcer.
His thesis was quoted by the
counsel for the distributor of "The
Miracle" a Roberto Rossellini film
banned in New York as "saci flex
ions.''
