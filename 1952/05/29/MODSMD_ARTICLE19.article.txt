# All America Watches California Primary

### HADLEY ROFF Daily Political Editor 
California's whirlwind of cam
paigning will subside Tuesday
when the state's almost five mil
lion registered voters will have
a chance to pick their parly
favorites in the stale primary.
On that fateful day, California Re
publicans and Democrats will name
their delegations to Hip parly con
ventions. And those delegation - will
be, perhaps. the most powerful poli
tical units at the July confabs
In both the Republican and Demo
cratic race, the margin between the
leading presidential candidates is as
slim as a gnat's eyelash.

J be 70-man Republican delegation
from California could well sway the
scale.
The Democratic party balance i.
still as erratic as a balloon in a
typhoon with but nine delegates sep
arating the two hardest-charging
candidates. Kefauver and Harriman.
(Kefauver-101; Harriman-!)2). Six- 1
ty-eighl valuable delegates are to
be won in California.
In both parly primaries, two dele- i
gations are entered the Warren a r\d

Earl Warren, ( alif'-rnia's Innad- ;
shouldered, l»ig smilin-j governor,
says thai his delegation will he

appears my chances have faded."
'the coventor's delegation consist:.'
of leading California Republicans in
cluding the two U.S. senators from j
the state, William F. Knowland and
Richard Nixon.
Warren, currently slumping the I
state for support, claims that lie will j
fight for the presidential nomination
at the July convention. He was GOP j
vice-presidential nominee in 194 K.
The other Republican slate, that of

out lo .kin Warren.

fered no platform asblc from
pledging (hp defeat of the gover

smcolli propaganda. attempting l<»
discredit Warren's record and in
tentions.
They claim thai thp governor is
interested only in bargaining off his
delegation in exchange for a cabinet
post or a place <>n the Supreme Court
hpneh.
In his literature, Wcrdcl crys that
the election fif Warrpn "would put
California's 70 convention votes in
bondage to one man to sell tn the
highest bidder at the convention."
Warren has often repeated that he
has made no deals and will make
none. Lashing out at Wcrdel's "hate
ful" tactics in a speech last week in
San Francisco, Warren said that "no
one can bring discredit on my ad

ministration."
Thou eh little is Known about most
of the Werdel delegates and ;np
portei;j. they . r eeni to be ultra-con
scrvative and hig-monied.

So far, the only group support that
has fallen to Werdel i;; thai of the
Gen Mac Arthur backers.
Other candidate croups have re
pudiated the Werdel slate The I
like-lkers have urged the backing
of Warren.
The Democratic contest iy no less
riotous.
Campaigning vigorously in Cali
fornia i.s slow, friendly Sen Estes
Kefauver who has been parading 'he
state shaking hands with all comets
Opposing Kefauver is Pnt Brown
who is a nominal candidate, pledging
the release of his delegation at the
convention.
Chief reason for Brown's cam
paigning is to save California's G8

j convention votes and to throw them
| to the administration favored can ■
; didate.
Brown, in a Daily interview Tut" -
day, intimated that his delegation
would back W. Averell Harriman.
Ilarriman tossed his derby into
the ring too late to enter (,'ali
fornia's primary. Brown had oi <c:
inally supported the candidacy «>i
Illinois' Adlai Stevenson who has
withdrawn himself from the race
Brown was with Harriman most of
Tuesday when the lanky candidate;
visited San Francisco.
Democratic leaders feel that Ke
fauver has not, the grasp of ci tron*
international and domestic situation ■
to lead the country. Harriman told
the Daily Tuesday that Kefauvei 1.
"naive and simple."
Mild mannered Kefauver, how-
I ever, has proven himself a champion
! ''ote-getter. Of the 13 primaries ' r
Iras entered, be has won 19 by a
thumping majority.
