# Excitement Over Panty Raid Assessment
## 
### 
The decision by the Council lor Student Con
trol as to payment lor damages incurred in the
panty raid last week is stirring up almost as
much excitement as the raid itself.
The Council worked out a scheme whereby
the students in the living groups involved pay
equally, though distribution of payment is not
equal among the living groups themselves.
Freshmen dorms will shoulder the bulk of the
payments with fraternity men and Stern and
Toyon men paying a smaller portion.
The scheme is based on the generally ac
cepted facts of who was involved. To an ex
tent, the assessments are arbitrary. Certainly,
I'ncina frosh who took no part in the raids
should not have to pay the same amount as
these who actually participated. The extent of
responsibility is difficult to assess. Yet the
payment scheme is probably as good as any
that could be devised.

The alternatives would be:
1. Voluntary payments, which would not be I
entirely fair, and might prove unsuccessful.
2. Payment of damages from a yeneral stu
dent body fund, which would distribute the
cost equally among the student body, a large
portion of which had nothing to do v/ith the raid.
3. Payment from the individuals directly in- 1
volved, which is fine in principle, but would
be difficult in execution. Many of the guilty
would go unapprehended.
Many letter-writers, running the gamut of
vociferouaness, voice complaints about the in
justice of the payment scheme. Yet they offer
no adequate alternatives.
It is unfortunate the raid occurred. Since it
has, let's not grumble about paying the bill. If
there is a better method of assessing respon
sibility, fine. Up to now, we haven't heard it.'
