# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
Farewell, *.">2
Dick McLean sputters his lust tomorrow. I still have
a year to go, so this won't be a hearts and flowers lust
column. Jt will just be a simple tribute to a lev/ of
the personalities who have meant the Class oi '52 to
me.
I remember that when I was one of the Encina
cliff-dwellers, we used to shout "To Hell with '52."
And we meant it. What right had punk tfndergrads
t<> swagger around like seniors, just because they
were a class ahead of us? Now, three years later,
they are seniors. They are just a hop, skip, anil a
lew finals away from graduation and from one of the
most violent transitions that they will have to make
in a lifetime of transitions.

And. damn, if I'm not going to
miss their familiar faces on Quad
next autumn. It's going to take
r.ome time to realize that a wide
eyed, pink-cheeked bunch of
'sfiers are going to take the place
of a class of kids that are as much
a part of Stanford as Cellar Coffee
and the pillars on the Quad.
Each of us will think of the
Class of '52 in terms of the people
we know best in it. I, personally,
will lemember . . .

AI Sieroty, one of the most able, amiable guys on
campus; Margie Horchitz, who once found herself on
the cover of Colliers in a crowd scene, and bought
• ix copies, only to discover that her father had bought
20. One of the sweetest kids on the Farm, Margie;
Wayne Alley, a remarkable person and one fellow
who knows the rules of order better than Robert him
self at iin Excom meeting; Bill OMersoti, head of Kally
Com, whom 112 kidded and needled, hut the guy still
wouldn't buy a pair of saddle shoes ... a guy with a
winning, magnetic personality.
(ieorge Denny, the showman of showmen and a
person whom I'm confident will make a name for
himself in the theatre; Dick Hern, not only a
athlete, but also the man who has shown a better
mental attitude towards sports than any other guy
on the Farm . . . Dick's one in a thousand; Fred and
Joe Chez, who would give the shirts oft their hacks
lor each other and for anyone else. ;
Liza Thacker, a refreshing individualist; Dick Klein,
who must have set a record for holding more im
portant posts than any student in Stanford history

. . . Quad editor, sports editor of the Daily, chairman
of fundamental standard committee, member of men's
council; editor of the senior paper; editor of the frosh
bible; editor of the eating club magazine; a member
of senior excom, etc., etc. Bill McColl, sole possessor
of the most talented 225 pounds in the country, also
modest to the core.
Gordon McKibben, the Daily editor who always
looks worried and who succeeded in turning out an
excellent volume; Jack McDonald, the Daily editor
who broke away from tradition and started writing
editorials on politics . . . and did a brilliant job of
it. They don't make people any better than Jack;
Swarthy Bob Batiin, the managing editor with the
infectious smile. Sue Goodstein, another managing
editor, but much better looking than Batiin.
Five comedians who did a little in athletics on the
side, Owen "Bruno" Powell, Jim Walsh, Gary Ker
korian, Harry Hugasian, and Rod Garner. Three bas
ketball players who are special favorites of mine as
persons . . . Jim Rainstead, Eddie Tucker, and Bruce
Iversen. Leon King, a guy who was squashing foot
ball opposition all last fall and who in a few years
will be preaching the Word from the pulpit; All-Coast
Jess Cone, as decent a person who ever matriculated
to the Farm; Sue Alter, a talented actress; Dick Fre
dell, who knows more about drama than Ram's Head
ever thought of; Helen Kessel. Jean MaltsefV, and Jean
Myer, a trio of good kids (and characters); Inez
Viole, wit personified, who bolted the ranks of the
Class of '515 to graduate with '52 and made Phi Bete
in the process.
Several guys, who, in my opinion, are going to go
someplace in this world . . . Dave McKean, Herb
Stusser, Hal Rosoff, Dan Evans, Bud McCord, Bob
Frojen, and Art Ahrahamson; a few girls who added
their bit to Stanford . . .Memo Chapman, Wilnia
Bumgartner, Betty Lou Edson, Nancy Erwin, and
Evie Wadsworth.
Then there's Dick McLean, my partner in crime,
who unlike most people sleeps in the daytime and
works at night. Talented, magnetic, Dick is liked
by everyone except the language department, who
hates his guts.
I get to the end of my column and I find that there
are so many more people I want to mention, Holy
Teter, Murgy Co.vkendal, Dick Corzirie, Jack Bickel,
and loads more.
These are some of Ihe people I will remember when
I think of the Class of '52. „
'52, we'll miss you.

the cover of Colliers in a crowd scene, and bought
• ix copies, only to discover that her father had bought
20. One of the sweetest kids on the Farm, Margie;
Wayne Alley, a remarkable person and one fellow
who knows the rules of order better than Robert him
self at iin Excom meeting; Bill OMersoti, head of Kally
Com, whom 112 kidded and needled, hut the guy still
wouldn't buy a pair of saddle shoes ... a guy with a
winning, magnetic personality.
(ieorge Denny, the showman of showmen and a
person whom I'm confident will make a name for
himself in the theatre; Dick Hern, not only a
athlete, but also the man who has shown a better
mental attitude towards sports than any other guy
on the Farm . . . Dick's one in a thousand; Fred and
Joe Chez, who would give the shirts oft their hacks
lor each other and for anyone else. ;
Liza Thacker, a refreshing individualist; Dick Klein,
who must have set a record for holding more im
portant posts than any student in Stanford history

. . . Quad editor, sports editor of the Daily, chairman
of fundamental standard committee, member of men's
council; editor of the senior paper; editor of the frosh
bible; editor of the eating club magazine; a member
of senior excom, etc., etc. Bill McColl, sole possessor
of the most talented 225 pounds in the country, also
modest to the core.
Gordon McKibben, the Daily editor who always
looks worried and who succeeded in turning out an
excellent volume; Jack McDonald, the Daily editor
who broke away from tradition and started writing
editorials on politics . . . and did a brilliant job of
it. They don't make people any better than Jack;
Swarthy Bob Batiin, the managing editor with the
infectious smile. Sue Goodstein, another managing
editor, but much better looking than Batiin.
Five comedians who did a little in athletics on the
side, Owen "Bruno" Powell, Jim Walsh, Gary Ker
korian, Harry Hugasian, and Rod Garner. Three bas
ketball players who are special favorites of mine as
persons . . . Jim Rainstead, Eddie Tucker, and Bruce
Iversen. Leon King, a guy who was squashing foot
ball opposition all last fall and who in a few years
will be preaching the Word from the pulpit; All-Coast
Jess Cone, as decent a person who ever matriculated
to the Farm; Sue Alter, a talented actress; Dick Fre
dell, who knows more about drama than Ram's Head
ever thought of; Helen Kessel. Jean MaltsefV, and Jean
Myer, a trio of good kids (and characters); Inez
Viole, wit personified, who bolted the ranks of the
Class of '515 to graduate with '52 and made Phi Bete
in the process.
Several guys, who, in my opinion, are going to go
someplace in this world . . . Dave McKean, Herb
Stusser, Hal Rosoff, Dan Evans, Bud McCord, Bob
Frojen, and Art Ahrahamson; a few girls who added
their bit to Stanford . . .Memo Chapman, Wilnia
Bumgartner, Betty Lou Edson, Nancy Erwin, and
Evie Wadsworth.
Then there's Dick McLean, my partner in crime,
who unlike most people sleeps in the daytime and
works at night. Talented, magnetic, Dick is liked
by everyone except the language department, who
hates his guts.
I get to the end of my column and I find that there
are so many more people I want to mention, Holy
Teter, Murgy Co.vkendal, Dick Corzirie, Jack Bickel,
and loads more.
These are some of Ihe people I will remember when
I think of the Class of '52. „
'52, we'll miss you.

Farewell, *.">2
Dick McLean sputters his lust tomorrow. I still have
a year to go, so this won't be a hearts and flowers lust
column. Jt will just be a simple tribute to a lev/ of
the personalities who have meant the Class oi '52 to
me.
I remember that when I was one of the Encina
cliff-dwellers, we used to shout "To Hell with '52."
And we meant it. What right had punk tfndergrads
t<> swagger around like seniors, just because they
were a class ahead of us? Now, three years later,
they are seniors. They are just a hop, skip, anil a
lew finals away from graduation and from one of the
most violent transitions that they will have to make
in a lifetime of transitions.

And. damn, if I'm not going to
miss their familiar faces on Quad
next autumn. It's going to take
r.ome time to realize that a wide
eyed, pink-cheeked bunch of
'sfiers are going to take the place
of a class of kids that are as much
a part of Stanford as Cellar Coffee
and the pillars on the Quad.
Each of us will think of the
Class of '52 in terms of the people
we know best in it. I, personally,
will lemember . . .

of the most talented 225 pounds in the country, also
modest to the core.
Gordon McKibben, the Daily editor who always
looks worried and who succeeded in turning out an
excellent volume; Jack McDonald, the Daily editor
who broke away from tradition and started writing
editorials on politics . . . and did a brilliant job of
it. They don't make people any better than Jack;
Swarthy Bob Batiin, the managing editor with the
infectious smile. Sue Goodstein, another managing
editor, but much better looking than Batiin.
Five comedians who did a little in athletics on the
side, Owen "Bruno" Powell, Jim Walsh, Gary Ker
korian, Harry Hugasian, and Rod Garner. Three bas
ketball players who are special favorites of mine as
persons . . . Jim Rainstead, Eddie Tucker, and Bruce
Iversen. Leon King, a guy who was squashing foot
ball opposition all last fall and who in a few years
will be preaching the Word from the pulpit; All-Coast
Jess Cone, as decent a person who ever matriculated
to the Farm; Sue Alter, a talented actress; Dick Fre
dell, who knows more about drama than Ram's Head
ever thought of; Helen Kessel. Jean MaltsefV, and Jean
Myer, a trio of good kids (and characters); Inez
Viole, wit personified, who bolted the ranks of the
Class of '515 to graduate with '52 and made Phi Bete
in the process.
Several guys, who, in my opinion, are going to go
someplace in this world . . . Dave McKean, Herb
Stusser, Hal Rosoff, Dan Evans, Bud McCord, Bob
Frojen, and Art Ahrahamson; a few girls who added
their bit to Stanford . . .Memo Chapman, Wilnia
Bumgartner, Betty Lou Edson, Nancy Erwin, and
Evie Wadsworth.
Then there's Dick McLean, my partner in crime,
who unlike most people sleeps in the daytime and
works at night. Talented, magnetic, Dick is liked
by everyone except the language department, who
hates his guts.
I get to the end of my column and I find that there
are so many more people I want to mention, Holy
Teter, Murgy Co.vkendal, Dick Corzirie, Jack Bickel,
and loads more.
These are some of Ihe people I will remember when
I think of the Class of '52. „
'52, we'll miss you.

Farewell, *.">2
Dick McLean sputters his lust tomorrow. I still have
a year to go, so this won't be a hearts and flowers lust
column. Jt will just be a simple tribute to a lev/ of
the personalities who have meant the Class oi '52 to
me.
I remember that when I was one of the Encina
cliff-dwellers, we used to shout "To Hell with '52."
And we meant it. What right had punk tfndergrads
t<> swagger around like seniors, just because they
were a class ahead of us? Now, three years later,
they are seniors. They are just a hop, skip, anil a
lew finals away from graduation and from one of the
most violent transitions that they will have to make
in a lifetime of transitions.

And. damn, if I'm not going to
miss their familiar faces on Quad
next autumn. It's going to take
r.ome time to realize that a wide
eyed, pink-cheeked bunch of
'sfiers are going to take the place
of a class of kids that are as much
a part of Stanford as Cellar Coffee
and the pillars on the Quad.
Each of us will think of the
Class of '52 in terms of the people
we know best in it. I, personally,
will lemember . . .

AI Sieroty, one of the most able, amiable guys on
campus; Margie Horchitz, who once found herself on
the cover of Colliers in a crowd scene, and bought
• ix copies, only to discover that her father had bought
20. One of the sweetest kids on the Farm, Margie;
Wayne Alley, a remarkable person and one fellow
who knows the rules of order better than Robert him
self at iin Excom meeting; Bill OMersoti, head of Kally
Com, whom 112 kidded and needled, hut the guy still
wouldn't buy a pair of saddle shoes ... a guy with a
winning, magnetic personality.
(ieorge Denny, the showman of showmen and a
person whom I'm confident will make a name for
himself in the theatre; Dick Hern, not only a
athlete, but also the man who has shown a better
mental attitude towards sports than any other guy
on the Farm . . . Dick's one in a thousand; Fred and
Joe Chez, who would give the shirts oft their hacks
lor each other and for anyone else. ;
Liza Thacker, a refreshing individualist; Dick Klein,
who must have set a record for holding more im
portant posts than any student in Stanford history

. . . Quad editor, sports editor of the Daily, chairman
of fundamental standard committee, member of men's
council; editor of the senior paper; editor of the frosh
bible; editor of the eating club magazine; a member
of senior excom, etc., etc. Bill McColl, sole possessor
