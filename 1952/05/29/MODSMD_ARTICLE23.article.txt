## Council for Control Clarifies Assessment Policy 
### 
To the Editor:
The Council for Student Control wishes to clarify
it . stand in the recent panty laid case and point out
it; procedures in handling the adjustment. We hope
that those responsible for the destructiveness and
property damage and clothes loss now realize the
eriousness ol their actions as a violation of the rights
of others and as a discredit to the rest of the student
body.
Through our investigations of the raid and inter
views with residence directors, house officers, R.A.'s,
ponsors, and administrative officers, specific group
responsibility for the raid was determined. Which
individuals involved in the action could be tracked
down in witch hunt fashion, the total number of those
implicated could never be determined. It was further
felt that there was group irresponsibility in failure
to deter the hasty plan. Did majority have to follow
the few?
Losses in property damage and clothes were re
ported to the administration and business office. With
total valuations computed, Council proceeded to work
iut a tentative solution. It was felt that sufficient
opportunity be given for the return of missing items
which would reduce total assessments. Provisions
were made for Encina and Roble and I.F.C. to work
out their own proportions for reimbursement. Council
wishes to thank these groups for their cooperation
in adjusting their own proportions of damage respon
sibility. We also appreciate the full attendance of
officers at the general meeting held Monday and their
overall participation in settling the case.
