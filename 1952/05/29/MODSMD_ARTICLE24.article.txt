# Reprisal for Damages 'Unsound'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
The decision sanctioned by Men's and Women's
Councils concerning reprisal for damages caused by
the recent "panty raid" episode is one ol poor reason
ing and unsound judgment. To hold every man who
resides on the Stanford Ci mpus responsible for the
childish actions ol a lew thoughtless individuals is

a detriment to the justice and effectiveness of student
government.
I am not concerned by the fact that everyone must
pay a few cents for the damage incurred, but I am
certainly disturbed by the realization that this de
cision places thi- blame upon the vast majority of our
students, who. on the evening of May 21. were study
ing, sleeping, or engaged in activities other than the
"panty raid."
In a democratic society, those who are guilty of
misbehavior i.re the ones who receive punishment for
their actions. To proclaim those actions the fault of
society might have some justification; but even so,
we can not keep a constant watch over the affairs ol
other people. It is the duty of society to help it;'
wrongdoers, not by shouldering the burden created
by the few, but by making those individuals leel tlie
effects of their actions to such an extent that then,
and not until then, they will refrain from future
participation in them.
Let us not deprive men of their right of registra
tion. who. for principle's sake might refuse to accept
a responsibility brought upon them by men who have
gone unpunished, while; the person who may have
c aused untold damage is allowed to register by pay
ing less than a single dollar. For the sake of the
Fundamental Standard and the dignity ol the in
dividual, let the so-called intelligencia merit its dis
tinction by upholding the democratic principle.
