# SC Incident 'More Serious'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Reading over the May 2Cth issue of the Daily, my
roommates and I came to the conclusion that the in
cident concerning the "tarred and feathered ' editor
id USC's yearbook is much more serious than our
p:inly raid. Fraternity members, annoyed by certain
remarks made by editor Fred Harper, resorted to
action which, in my estimation, is really questionable.
SC's little "incident" receiver! but passing mention
in our Daily; no doubt it received little publicity in
LA. Yet our much more insignificant panty raid has
supposedly lowered Stanford's prestige, and caused
the public to look at us with disapproval. Isn't SC's
action much more serious and really worthy of severe
criticism?
