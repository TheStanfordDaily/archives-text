# Cindermen Vie This Summer For NCAA, Olympic Honors
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
School will be out in two weeks for most of the school, but for a few hardy individuals, namely
the Stanford track team, the real season has just begun.
From now on in, it's the national level, with an eye for the Olympics. The Saturday of June 7,
13 men will enter the Pacific Athletic Association meet at Berkeley. All the track teams from the
Area and thereabouts v/ill be represented, but the emphasis will be on individual events, and

not team scoring. There will be no
official winning team.
Stanford will be without the serv
ices ol Maury Parson and Bob Ma
fee, Stanford's two ace sprinters, who
are both out of the meet with bad
Also missing will be the big man,
Bob Mathias, who, because ot prior
commitments, will be up at Portland,
running in the North West Pacific
Athletic Association meet.
The weekend after. June 13 and
11, the NCAA meet for the national
college championship will lie run
oil at Berkeley. How Stanford will
do is an uncertainty. As a dual
meet team, Stanford has the depth
lo rate about fourth in the nation,
but it doesn't have the individual
toppers to pull the points in the j
Nationals. In team scoring, SC is j
once more a sure in.
For college athletes, this is IT.
The first six places in each event
will qualify for the Olympic tryouts
held in LA. o:i the 27th and 28th
of June.
The following weekend, the Na
tional AAU meet will be held in
Long Beach. Any Stanford athletes
that don't qualify in the NC2A meet
can enter for the Olympic Club, if i
they wish, and the next six that
place, discounting the ones that have
already placed, will gel a try at the
Olympic team.
Further qualifiers for the team will
rome from the Armed Services meet
1.1 Long Beach held on the 6th and
7tli of June.
The big meet of the year for Ma
thias, outside of the Olympics, will
be the National Decathlon Champ
ionships at Tulare on July 1-2. Big
competition will come from his usual
livals, Rev. Robert Richards and
Rill Albans.
Richards and Albans will have
two cracks at Mathias, most likely,
as the top three men qualify for the
Olympics. As it stands, they will
probably come in one, two, three
versus the greatest athletes in the

world in Helsinki, and Mr. Mathias
will probably be number one.
In the nationals, eight men could
conceivably place in a total of nine
events, judging on this year's per
formances. The old stand-by. Ma
thias. can't collect points for ver
satility. lie should place high in
the lli»h Hurdles, prohahly a third
or fourth, and could place any
where from sixth to second in the
discus.
Bob Simon, crack miler, who has
been spending bis weekends trini
ing seconds off his life-time bests,
could come in, as could his younger
counterpart, Bob Reed, in the two
mile and 5,000 meters. He will have
to top his 9:24.4 season best in the
eight lapper to do it.
John Wooley, captain of the Stan
ford team, could conceivably crack
into the top six with a season best
of 1:53.4.
In the shot put, both Howie Hertz
and Chuck Hokanson could come in.
They have been improving consider
ably as the season rolls along, and
they boast 53 feet B['■> inch and 52
leet 11 V-i inch bests respectively.
Their bests should do it, this year.
In the javelin, Leo could
make the top six, hut lie will have
to top his seasonal best of 211 feet
inches by at least five feet to
guarantee it.
On the surface of present marks,
the only other possible point-getter
seems to be Pele McKay in the
broad jump. A 23 foot 8 inch jump
could place.


OLYMPIC DISTANCE MAN'.' —
Bob Simon has suddenly blos
somed into u contender for Na
tional and Olympic honors. After
galloping 4:18 miles through the
dual meet season, lie galloped! a
4:11 or 12 mile running the last
leg on a relay and then showed
that he meant business with a
4:1."i.5 second-place finish in last
week's PCC's. In the Nationals
and Olympics lie will have to vun
metric races, but he should Hash
his new-found speed anyway.
