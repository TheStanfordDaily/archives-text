# And in the Majors
## 
### LARRY CAHN 
Cleveland still appears the team
to beat, in the American League as
the Indians withstood the weak
challenge of the Browns last week
end to retain a 2 1 /-»-game loop lead.
The New York Giants snapped an
eight-game Dodger win streak Mon
day and went on to sweep the series
and move to the top of the National
League standings by 2'j games.
Washington is still the surprise of
the American League. The Sena
tor,, with mediocre hitting and top
fielding and pitching, have refused
to be shoved down the league lad
der and are tied with Boston for
second-place honors behind Cleve
land. Boston and Washington mix
it lip this long Memorial Day week
end. It will be the Capital City
nine's first real test.
'Ilie Senators have been helped
tremendously by old Yankees
Jackie Jensen and Archie Wilson.
The pair, \Hio arc batting third
and fourth vespectively in the
Wa» hingtun order of nine, have

given the Senators a spark that
lias been lacking. Frank Shea,
Senator hurler, has only allowed
one run in his past three starts.
And while the unexpecteds sur
prise, the Yankees find themselves
nestled anion;; the also-rans, five
games out. The New York club just
hasn't shown the power. Its little
Phil Ri::7.uto is leading the club with
a .328 mark.
The strange fact is that the
Yanks are way out in front in
team hitting, Imt that power is
lacking. So perhaps, after all, it
is power, doubles, triples, arid
homers that win games, and not
the single.
And watch the Chicago While
Sox. They are starting to climb.

The New York Giants, paced by
hurler Sal Maglie who has posted
nine wins and no defeats, and the
Dodgers are still making the Na
tional League race a two-team fight.
The pending loss of Willie Mays,
who is just about the Giants' only
good defensive outfielder, to the
service will hurt. In fact, it might
kill pennant hopes. The Brooklyn
nine seems to have recovered from
the service loss of Newcombe.
The coming weekend is a long
one for the majors, with double
headers scheduled throughout the
circuits for Memorial Day tomor
row, followed by singles Saturday
and many twb-game stands again
on Sunday. Monday might find
things shaken up.


I'LAY BALL—Although school is coming to an end, the major league play is just coming into
full swing. Cleveland holds on to a comfortable lead in the American loop, while the Giants are
a step and a half in front of Brooklyn in the Senior loop. When students return to the scene of
their crimes next fall, things should be a little more settled. The above shot shows Valo of the
A's sliding into second in a recent battle with the Senators. —NEA Telephoto
