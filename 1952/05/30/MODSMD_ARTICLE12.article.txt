## 
### HARRY MARTIN 
The chips are down for the In
dian crewmen as they go into the
traditional Cal-Stanford three-mile
boat race tomorrow afternoon in the
Alameda Estuary with sights
pinned on upsetting the number
one crew in the nation.
There will be five races on the
afternoon's agenda second frosh,
third varsity, frosh, JV, and varsity,
in that order. The first race W'll
start at 1:30 p.m., with the fro:;h
meeting at 2:30, and the varsity
scheduled for 1 p.m. Finish line for
all live races is under the Fruitvale
Street Bridge which connect" Oak
land with Alameda, the Estuary
flowing in between.
This will he the second meeting
of these two crews within two
weeks. Stanford was defeated b,v
t'ul at Newport in the West Coast
S{ int Championship finals, Hie
iinxet; Farm oarsmen caught a
crab at the halfivav mark, 1,000
inrters. and soun out nf control.
ITnitl (hat time Stanford was a
quarter of a length behind and
was rowing at a lower lu-at.
Card crew mentor Bob White
that his shell "shouldn't be
counted out on th'- basis of this
race because tliev bad a lot left."
White looks to tomorrow's meet
to see how his squad shapes up
against the be.l competition in
the country.
Ky Ebright, Cal crew coach, says,
"Stanford can'l be counted out be
cause they showed definite signs <>112
challenging until that crab." Ebright
and White feel that llie three-mile
race, longer than the 2,000 meters
that Stanford has rowed at all sea
son, should lÂ»c to Cal's advantage
due to a weight advantage. Any
way. the Golden Bears will be out
to prove the validity of this rcccnt
victory over the Indian oar: men.
White will start four leltertnen,
among whom are three seniors, in
the same varsity shell that rowed
in the southland rece last week.
Dave Hcrdnian, Dewey Hechl,
Jim Filer, Bill (irenninger, Jerry
Thayer. I'hil West, Bill Allen,
Sam Stearns, and Ted Cannis will
make up the first boat.
This will be the Card crew's last
race before the International Row
ing Regatta at. Syracuse, N.Y., and
the United States Olympic tryout .
at Worcester, Mass. Both of these
races will come late in June and are
financed by donations to the Stan
ford Crew Association.
