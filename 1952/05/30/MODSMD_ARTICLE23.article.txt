The Stanford Players and Music Department, wilh the assistance
o( a few professional singers, marie the West Coast premiere o(
"The Love lor Three Oranges" a successful one before a packed
house in Memorial Auditorium last night.
Without a doubt, there is no college in the United States which

could have given a better perform
ance of this highly complex and
amusing modern opera by Proko
fieff. It was not even necessary to
make the usual adjustment of one's
ear when evaluating amateur in
stead of professional performances.
Last night's production, from (he
orchestra to the staging, would have
pleased even the most discriminat
ing audience.
All of the satire and subtletv that
Prokofieff poured* into this dazzling
score was amply brought out by
an excellent cast. Hay Hammett's
superb stage presence gave the role
of the king the proper Wagnerian
dignity (parodying King Mark in
Tristan) which the characterization
calls for. Hew.is in very good voice,
except for a little edgeyness in the
lower notes, anid his acting must
take top honors for last night's
presentation. Whither Andersen
fPantalon) gave a fine account of
himself both dramatically and vo
cally. His gentle clowning, along
with Joseph Tissier's fine peiform
ance of the jester Trouffaldino. had
a great deal of vigor and chaim
along with their robust buffoonery.
Lawrence Mason was in very hue
voice and did a marvelous job fo
portraying the Prime. His comedy
always caught (I»satire of 'hp typ
ical operatic pi nice who is going
out in search of something or other.
Joan Stenseri was excellent as
Smeraldinc, and always gave very
'.•leai enunciation Si" h wa not the
case with Vivianne Little, who was
very difficult to understand. I'loise
Farrell's H'ata Morgana was well
Sl'llg.
Harold Sclnnidl ; chorus, although
eliciting some fins sound, was fre
quently off cue and .loppy. The
joinid of the voices did oof .-uf?er r o

much as die unintelligibility of the
words, which seemed to tun into
each other. Some good blushing up
for the nex * Iwo performances can
cure this easily.
F. Cowles Strickland's stage di
rection was of the highest caliber,
and the sets, designed by O. G.
Brockett, were outstanding.
The most outstanding aspect of
the production was the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra. Under San
dor Salgu's inspiring direction, the
orchestra rose to I lie occasion to
present a truly fine performance.
