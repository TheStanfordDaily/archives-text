# This Year—A Beginning
## 
### 
This, the editor's traditional last gasp edi
torial. is mainly for you, Dorothy and Walt, but
J think it has something lor the rest of the stu
dent body, too.
I'm sitting here suddenly jolted by the reali
zation that lour college years arc coming to an
end. Dead week, then finals, and graduation.
Another class numeral about to be set in Inner
Quad. I'm taking a backward glance over the
school yenr, and it seems to fit into a pattern.
In many ways it was an ordinary year. We
vseni to the Hose Howl, not so ordinary, and
took a sound drubbing, guile usual. We re
member that most fall quarter.
The year was ari important one foi Stanford,
ft was the laying of a foundation for things to
come —not so much their fruition.
The recent attempt to define Hi*- Fundamental
Htandard may not stand for all time, but il is
a base to build on, and future years will see a
fixmer structure grow.
The campus, (he Excom, and the Board of
Trustees finally took the question of partisan
politics and political speakers on campus by
the horns, and emerged with a step that is at
once disappointing and encouraging.
Disappointing in that traditional conserva
tism, the failure to look realities in the face, the
persistence in the belief that Stanford can some
how remain an isolated island permeates the
eventual solution.
I doubt if much in the way of effective pro
grams can come off until 1!)53, due lo the con
dition the Board of Trust -es attached to the
relaxation ol the political ban. The condition
that all sides of questions must be represented
on. tire same platform during programs, is fine
idealistically, but it is impractical and frustrat
ing
The action is encouraging in that it is a
step forward, a foot in the door, il you want,
making inevitable an cvenlUitl wide open
door, something we should have had long
ago.
Realizing it was a lone voice, Excom also took
an important step when it passed a resolution
recommending a lowering of the minimum le
gal drinking aye to 10. The action represents
the earliest agitation in the direction of a re
form that will gain momentum and eventually
be effected.
The year saw a dent in the foreign language
requirement, initiated largely by undergradu
ates. It seems a round-about compromise, satis
fying lev;, but it is an elfoit in the direction of
change, toward a more flexible curricula, which

should always be progressive and forward
looking, changing with the times.
Too often change becomes it bogey at tra
dition bound Stanford, and what should be dy
namic becomes musty and inflexible, increas
ingly so the longer change is resisted.
.El foils this your mark a beginning. You
will bo dealing with most ol these same piob
lems next year. 1 don't think you can regard
them as solved. They are important right now
because they arc <i start and will influence
iutuie development. They represent possibly
the inevitable mistakes and miscalculations,
the earliest uncertain growings, the mistakes
which the future can sweep away and piolit
from.
Right now I know you're looking forward,
not back, toward Volume 122. It will be a good
volume. You'll have the November elections,
that once every-four years story. Another foot
boll season, maybe not quite as successful, but
that may be just as well when you consider
what athletic success involves.
You will be heading a loyal, hard-working
staff, and if you give it your confidence, I know
it will be justified.
As for advice, let rne offer this:
I think the Daily too alien in the past has
fallen down cn the job. Too of ten there hasn't
been the out-ol class stimulus and orientation
iowaid consideration ol ideas a little beyond
the purely local and immediately personal
aspects ol Stanford life.
1 think we owe it to our readers to guide a
broader orientation, an orientation that implies
that the contents of the Bonn Peace Treaty arc
infinitely more important than whether or not
Rally Corn yets sweater emblems, infinitely
more significant in terms of the college news
paper's role, the educational process, and pro
viding the preparation for post-graduate life the
classroom doesn't provide.
My advice: Give increased space to national
and international news and editorial interpre
tation of the news.
You know the difficulties involved here as
well as I do. The editorial interpretation isn't
always easy. Bui right or wrong (and 1 think
oflei\ it is a mailer more of point of view than
right or wrong) if you are fair, have the facts,
and shoot squarely, it cannot but be worth
while.
That's about it. Working with you has made
Volume 121 a particularly rich experience for
me. 1 know you are going to do an outstanding
job on. Volume 122. T.el me wish you the best
of luck. Jack
