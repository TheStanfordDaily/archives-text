# Memo to the Graduating Senior
## 
### 
Could it be that just a few weeks before we
get that diploma we feel we knov/ very little?
If wo pin down these four years into some
thing that equals the list of courses we've taken,
the many facts we've spilled out on exams, or
the hours spent in classes filling up note books,
it doesn't quite measure what we'd like to call
cur education.
And when we can't seem to find that nicely
wrapped package of knowledge within our
selves that will tell the world we're college
giaduates, we wonder why now, of .ill times,
we should feel so inadequate.
Perhaps we are suddenly aware that we are
living in a world with two billion people, a
world where answers to problem.; ate not so
easy to find. Perhaps we realize that behind
the facts we've cither absorbed or forgotten,
there uie people and ideas to reckon with tv/o

complex factors that can't bo expressed in cas
ual numbers or words.
Maybe we've discovered that there is more
than one side to any given question, and that
each one is wrapped up in a scote of attitudes,
environments, and personalities. And maybe
we've even learned to listen to the other side,
and have seen that issues, whether political,
social, or economic, can not be clearly defined
as to right and wrong.
When we.ask ourselves again why we feel
wo knew so little, perhaps we can honestly
answer th.it its because these four years have
just been a beginning; that if we have learned
anything, it is that there is much more to learn.
And, maybe we can even say that in trying to
understand a liny part of the human community,
we have looked beyond the differences be
tween peoples and ideas and have seen some
thing common to us all. - Sue
