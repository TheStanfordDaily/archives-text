### DICK McLEAN 
The Last One . . .
Il isn't fair. They're throwing me out of Stanford.
It's not because of my blast against the foreign
languages nor die anti-scholastic tone of the Pull
Sessions. I did everything 1 was supposed to do.
I went plus enough and completed IMO units. So
they're lacking me out. 'I hey call it graduation and
say I've got to go. But it isn't fair. I'm only a boy,
I'm not (it for the outside world. Why hell, it seems
that 1 only got here yesterday- or the day before at
most.
Bill seriously, whatever happened to the four
years? They slipped hy so swiftly. When you're
a freshman, graduation seems half a lifetime away.
Ilul through the undergraduate yeais you forget to
watch the clock and all ton suddenly you receive a
card asking how many tickets you want lor gradua
tion—your own graduation. Because then you're
a last quarter senior, and vou catch yourself staring
at things you've seen a thousand times before, but
looking .hard this one time so that you can keep it
al! in your memory to have for later on. A senti
mental tiling to do, granted, hut these college
years have meant I'un and security and you want to
carry a little of litem with you when you stagger
into the brawl called life.
These college years have been gone) for me. 1 don't
I hink I've regretted any ol it, the all night parties or
the ail night cramming sessions. (There were far
more of the latter than the former but the former
were far more memorable.) I think I've learned a lev/
things about college, Stanford and life in thei:e shoit
years.
Of college 1 would say, "Don't miss any of it." Col
lege is ihe great experience of youth. But college
must be understood as just that, an experience. It
consists of the books, the classrooms, the people, the
parties, the worries, the joy, the thinking, and more.
It's function should be to truly educate for later life,
not to teach a man how to make a living but to teach
him bow to live. This business of learning how to live
is not found exclusively with the wealth of the class
room. It is lound in ihe 2 o'clock in the morning bull
sessions, in an afternoon of beer drinking, in the
people you really know, in parking.
Of college, then, 1 would say, miss none of it
the learning or the living. But the time slips by so
swiftly.

Of Stanford, I would say, "Remember that we are
Stanford. Sandstone buildings and libraries are in
animate objects. (July people can give them life. And
only we can give life to this, our University.
We've £;:»( one of the best colleges in the country
and we're all lucky to he here. (If you doubt the
last statement, think hack to the day you got your
letter of acceptance and how you felt.) From this
realization must follow a feeling of responsibility,
Stanford's great and we've got to keep it such.
We've got to keep the traditions, the spirit, the
lile that has distinguished our University from a
learning factory. It is only this spirit and feeling of
youth that makes the sandstone building, the Quad,
and Stanford living things.
We are Stanford. We must care. If we don't, who
will?
Of life, I can only say, "Live it." Not hedonistiely
but fully and well. Let me quote a piece of writing
that I have tacked on my wall. It comes from"The
Time ol Your Lile" by William Saroyan.
"In the time of your life, live so that in that good
time there shall be no ugliness or death for your
self or
lor any hie your life touches. Seek goodness every
where,
and when it is found, bring it out of its hiding place
and let it be free and unashamed . . . Be the in
ferior
• of no man, nor of any man be the superior. Re
member that
every man is a variation of yourself. No man's guilt
is
not yours, nor is any man's innocence a tiling
apart .. .
In the time of your life live—so that in that won
der o us
time you shall not add to the misery and sorrow
of the world,
hut shall smile to the infinite delight and mystery
of it."
Coodbye, it's been damn fine knowing all of you."

a freshman, graduation seems half a lifetime away.
Ilul through the undergraduate yeais you forget to
watch the clock and all ton suddenly you receive a
card asking how many tickets you want lor gradua
tion—your own graduation. Because then you're
a last quarter senior, and vou catch yourself staring
at things you've seen a thousand times before, but
looking .hard this one time so that you can keep it
al! in your memory to have for later on. A senti
mental tiling to do, granted, hut these college
years have meant I'un and security and you want to
carry a little of litem with you when you stagger
into the brawl called life.
These college years have been gone) for me. 1 don't
I hink I've regretted any ol it, the all night parties or
the ail night cramming sessions. (There were far
more of the latter than the former but the former
were far more memorable.) I think I've learned a lev/
things about college, Stanford and life in thei:e shoit
years.
Of college 1 would say, "Don't miss any of it." Col
lege is ihe great experience of youth. But college
must be understood as just that, an experience. It
consists of the books, the classrooms, the people, the
parties, the worries, the joy, the thinking, and more.
It's function should be to truly educate for later life,
not to teach a man how to make a living but to teach
him bow to live. This business of learning how to live
is not found exclusively with the wealth of the class
room. It is lound in ihe 2 o'clock in the morning bull
sessions, in an afternoon of beer drinking, in the
people you really know, in parking.
Of college, then, 1 would say, miss none of it
the learning or the living. But the time slips by so
swiftly.

Of Stanford, I would say, "Remember that we are
Stanford. Sandstone buildings and libraries are in
animate objects. (July people can give them life. And
only we can give life to this, our University.
We've £;:»( one of the best colleges in the country
and we're all lucky to he here. (If you doubt the
last statement, think hack to the day you got your
letter of acceptance and how you felt.) From this
realization must follow a feeling of responsibility,
Stanford's great and we've got to keep it such.
We've got to keep the traditions, the spirit, the
lile that has distinguished our University from a
learning factory. It is only this spirit and feeling of
youth that makes the sandstone building, the Quad,
and Stanford living things.
We are Stanford. We must care. If we don't, who
will?
Of life, I can only say, "Live it." Not hedonistiely
but fully and well. Let me quote a piece of writing
that I have tacked on my wall. It comes from"The
Time ol Your Lile" by William Saroyan.
"In the time of your life, live so that in that good
time there shall be no ugliness or death for your
self or
lor any hie your life touches. Seek goodness every
where,
and when it is found, bring it out of its hiding place
and let it be free and unashamed . . . Be the in
ferior
• of no man, nor of any man be the superior. Re
member that
every man is a variation of yourself. No man's guilt
is
not yours, nor is any man's innocence a tiling
apart .. .
In the time of your life live—so that in that won
der o us
time you shall not add to the misery and sorrow
of the world,
hut shall smile to the infinite delight and mystery
of it."
Coodbye, it's been damn fine knowing all of you."

These college years have been gone) for me. 1 don't
I hink I've regretted any ol it, the all night parties or
the ail night cramming sessions. (There were far
more of the latter than the former but the former
were far more memorable.) I think I've learned a lev/
things about college, Stanford and life in thei:e shoit
years.
Of college 1 would say, "Don't miss any of it." Col
lege is ihe great experience of youth. But college
must be understood as just that, an experience. It
consists of the books, the classrooms, the people, the
parties, the worries, the joy, the thinking, and more.
It's function should be to truly educate for later life,
not to teach a man how to make a living but to teach
him bow to live. This business of learning how to live
is not found exclusively with the wealth of the class
room. It is lound in ihe 2 o'clock in the morning bull
sessions, in an afternoon of beer drinking, in the
people you really know, in parking.
Of college, then, 1 would say, miss none of it
the learning or the living. But the time slips by so
swiftly.

Of Stanford, I would say, "Remember that we are
Stanford. Sandstone buildings and libraries are in
animate objects. (July people can give them life. And
only we can give life to this, our University.
We've £;:»( one of the best colleges in the country
and we're all lucky to he here. (If you doubt the
last statement, think hack to the day you got your
letter of acceptance and how you felt.) From this
realization must follow a feeling of responsibility,
Stanford's great and we've got to keep it such.
We've got to keep the traditions, the spirit, the
lile that has distinguished our University from a
learning factory. It is only this spirit and feeling of
youth that makes the sandstone building, the Quad,
and Stanford living things.
We are Stanford. We must care. If we don't, who
will?
Of life, I can only say, "Live it." Not hedonistiely
but fully and well. Let me quote a piece of writing
that I have tacked on my wall. It comes from"The
Time ol Your Lile" by William Saroyan.
"In the time of your life, live so that in that good
time there shall be no ugliness or death for your
self or
lor any hie your life touches. Seek goodness every
where,
and when it is found, bring it out of its hiding place
and let it be free and unashamed . . . Be the in
ferior
• of no man, nor of any man be the superior. Re
member that
every man is a variation of yourself. No man's guilt
is
not yours, nor is any man's innocence a tiling
apart .. .
In the time of your life live—so that in that won
der o us
time you shall not add to the misery and sorrow
of the world,
hut shall smile to the infinite delight and mystery
of it."
Coodbye, it's been damn fine knowing all of you."

The Last One . . .
Il isn't fair. They're throwing me out of Stanford.
It's not because of my blast against the foreign
languages nor die anti-scholastic tone of the Pull
Sessions. I did everything 1 was supposed to do.
I went plus enough and completed IMO units. So
they're lacking me out. 'I hey call it graduation and
say I've got to go. But it isn't fair. I'm only a boy,
I'm not (it for the outside world. Why hell, it seems
that 1 only got here yesterday- or the day before at
most.
Bill seriously, whatever happened to the four
years? They slipped hy so swiftly. When you're
a freshman, graduation seems half a lifetime away.
Ilul through the undergraduate yeais you forget to
watch the clock and all ton suddenly you receive a
card asking how many tickets you want lor gradua
tion—your own graduation. Because then you're
a last quarter senior, and vou catch yourself staring
at things you've seen a thousand times before, but
looking .hard this one time so that you can keep it
al! in your memory to have for later on. A senti
mental tiling to do, granted, hut these college
years have meant I'un and security and you want to
carry a little of litem with you when you stagger
into the brawl called life.
