### DICK KLEIN Around the Infield 
Well, gang, as the ancient Greek prophet once said, "Lot's have it around
Dip infield just one more time." And now as I sit down and one-finger
lype my way through the last column, I can realize what that old Daily
"■ports staff slogan really means.
Before this very moment, it was hard to figure out why the guys who
have gone on belore had such a tough time writing off sports here on The
Farm. Great guys like Johnny Hall, Bill Switrart, John Breier, Al Berry,
Boh Burristein, Dwight Wilbur, and Earl Odeil all put their skill to the task
of the last column and found it a difficult job. "After all," 1 used to say,
"It's just another good-bye."

But it's a iou&Ti ti.Tng io <w>. Before we gel to
crying towel stuff. I would like to make a couple
of strong requests. First o(T, I feel it only fitting that
the No. jersey never be worn again by a Stanford
gridder. The jersey of Big Bill McCoil should be
retired officially as soon as possible.
Next, let's win the Axe. The Class of '52 that is
soon to graduate is the only class in Stanford's his
tory not to have possession of the Big Game prize
at any time in the four vears. Chuck Taylor, with
the Indian eleven disqualified from Rose Howl play
next year, has set his main sight on winning the Big
One up in Berkeley. The Bears are going to lie
mighty tough to tame, but Chuck is the kind of
guy that can inspire his players to do the near im
possible.

Right about here it would be fitting to mention just a few of the athletes
tliiit will graduate with the Class of '.'52 who will always be standouts in any
history of Stanford sports. In football, there's Kill McColl, ol course; like
able, quarterbacking Gary Kerkorian; the. dependable ever-ready Dick
Horn; and gutty, heady Capt. Jesse Cone.
There's the senior trio on the basketball team —Jimmy Walsh, who
: tai led every game all four years; Eddie Tucker, the red-hot scoring sen
sation; and Capt. Jim Kamstcad, the big unassuming man who handled all
the rebound chores in fine fashion.
'1 hen the baseballers, Joe Che/, Artie Abrahamson, and I)ick Cor
yiti«\ who it their all to win another pennant before they left. And
. eet .swinging Dick McElyea and Keith Deekman in f.'oll; Tommy I.ivvyn
ami (ieorge Gentry on the tennis courts; and Bobby Frojen and liiuce I'ut
n.nti who have been champion paddlers all along. Missing from the thinclad
s<|iiad will be Capt. John Woolley, Wally McCamant, and Chuck Hokanson.
Hut the strange and wonderful thing about a place like Stanford is
that there are always new men ready to step into the shoes of the stars
who have graduated. Maybe at first, the shoes are a little too big, but
it isn't long before they're winning their own niches. And that's the way
it should he. *

The reason things work out so well and the reason Stanford athletes
will continue to be :o truly successful despite the lack of over-emphasis
is the men who man the coaching jobs. From top to bottom, no one could
find a higher-minded group of men.
There are the new ones just starting out in coaching like Chuck Taylor,
Boh Burnett, Bob Renker, Torn Haynie, and Bud Finger. The old-timers
like Everett Dsan and Husky Hunt. And then Jack Weiershauser who has
stuck with alma mater through thick and thin and does an amazing job
and who certainly deserves everybody's support on this Olympic trip.
Hp and down the line, each one of these men are just as interested
in winning the game, the meet, or the match as the next guy. But these
Stanford coaches mix in a good deal of sportsmanship and give-and-take
and all the things so important in sports and in life itself.
That leads up to my last request. My only advice to Larry and his
staff for Vol 122 is be loyal in your support of these men. Never be afraid
to criticize honestly, lor they demand it. But always shoot fair and square
with them.
So with that note, I'd like to say good-bye to Larry Calm, the new sports
editor; Pete Grothe, who'll double in brass as a member of SAB: Mike Hud
son, the whimsical Palo Alto philosopher; tricky Dick Malt/man; I'hil Her
man, the answer-man; and up-and-coming frosh Don Webster and Elmore
Seeds; and all the rest of The Sporting Gang. Good luck and have a great
year,
I guess the best way to end the Sporting Line is to recall a little story
lhat took place in Coach Dean's baseball methods class. Prof. Dean was
citing the Bobby Thompson homerun that won the National League pennant
for the Giants last year as one of the greatest moments in sports.
Dean asked his athletic-scholars if they could think of any other in
cident that compared with that for sheer drama, etc. All was quiet, and
then Boh Meyers raised his hand and sincerely stated, ''Yes, the time
tiiat I pule-vaulted II feet against the Olympic Club." All I can say is
that my big moment has been getting to really know the Stanford sports
scene and report to you the important events like beating SC in the
Coliseum, the Cal basketball series, tin- final SC baseball games, and win
ning the Big Meet.

Well, gang, as the ancient Greek prophet once said, "Lot's have it around
Dip infield just one more time." And now as I sit down and one-finger
lype my way through the last column, I can realize what that old Daily
"■ports staff slogan really means.
Before this very moment, it was hard to figure out why the guys who
have gone on belore had such a tough time writing off sports here on The
Farm. Great guys like Johnny Hall, Bill Switrart, John Breier, Al Berry,
Boh Burristein, Dwight Wilbur, and Earl Odeil all put their skill to the task
of the last column and found it a difficult job. "After all," 1 used to say,
"It's just another good-bye."

But it's a iou&Ti ti.Tng io <w>. Before we gel to
crying towel stuff. I would like to make a couple
of strong requests. First o(T, I feel it only fitting that
the No. jersey never be worn again by a Stanford
gridder. The jersey of Big Bill McCoil should be
retired officially as soon as possible.
Next, let's win the Axe. The Class of '52 that is
soon to graduate is the only class in Stanford's his
tory not to have possession of the Big Game prize
at any time in the four vears. Chuck Taylor, with
the Indian eleven disqualified from Rose Howl play
next year, has set his main sight on winning the Big
One up in Berkeley. The Bears are going to lie
mighty tough to tame, but Chuck is the kind of
guy that can inspire his players to do the near im
possible.

Right about here it would be fitting to mention just a few of the athletes
tliiit will graduate with the Class of '.'52 who will always be standouts in any
history of Stanford sports. In football, there's Kill McColl, ol course; like
able, quarterbacking Gary Kerkorian; the. dependable ever-ready Dick
Horn; and gutty, heady Capt. Jesse Cone.
There's the senior trio on the basketball team —Jimmy Walsh, who
: tai led every game all four years; Eddie Tucker, the red-hot scoring sen
sation; and Capt. Jim Kamstcad, the big unassuming man who handled all
the rebound chores in fine fashion.
'1 hen the baseballers, Joe Che/, Artie Abrahamson, and I)ick Cor
yiti«\ who it their all to win another pennant before they left. And
. eet .swinging Dick McElyea and Keith Deekman in f.'oll; Tommy I.ivvyn
ami (ieorge Gentry on the tennis courts; and Bobby Frojen and liiuce I'ut
n.nti who have been champion paddlers all along. Missing from the thinclad
s<|iiad will be Capt. John Woolley, Wally McCamant, and Chuck Hokanson.
Hut the strange and wonderful thing about a place like Stanford is
that there are always new men ready to step into the shoes of the stars
who have graduated. Maybe at first, the shoes are a little too big, but
it isn't long before they're winning their own niches. And that's the way
it should he. *

The reason things work out so well and the reason Stanford athletes
will continue to be :o truly successful despite the lack of over-emphasis
is the men who man the coaching jobs. From top to bottom, no one could
find a higher-minded group of men.
There are the new ones just starting out in coaching like Chuck Taylor,
Boh Burnett, Bob Renker, Torn Haynie, and Bud Finger. The old-timers
like Everett Dsan and Husky Hunt. And then Jack Weiershauser who has
stuck with alma mater through thick and thin and does an amazing job
and who certainly deserves everybody's support on this Olympic trip.
Hp and down the line, each one of these men are just as interested
in winning the game, the meet, or the match as the next guy. But these
Stanford coaches mix in a good deal of sportsmanship and give-and-take
and all the things so important in sports and in life itself.
That leads up to my last request. My only advice to Larry and his
staff for Vol 122 is be loyal in your support of these men. Never be afraid
to criticize honestly, lor they demand it. But always shoot fair and square
with them.
So with that note, I'd like to say good-bye to Larry Calm, the new sports
editor; Pete Grothe, who'll double in brass as a member of SAB: Mike Hud
son, the whimsical Palo Alto philosopher; tricky Dick Malt/man; I'hil Her
man, the answer-man; and up-and-coming frosh Don Webster and Elmore
Seeds; and all the rest of The Sporting Gang. Good luck and have a great
year,
I guess the best way to end the Sporting Line is to recall a little story
lhat took place in Coach Dean's baseball methods class. Prof. Dean was
citing the Bobby Thompson homerun that won the National League pennant
for the Giants last year as one of the greatest moments in sports.
Dean asked his athletic-scholars if they could think of any other in
cident that compared with that for sheer drama, etc. All was quiet, and
then Boh Meyers raised his hand and sincerely stated, ''Yes, the time
tiiat I pule-vaulted II feet against the Olympic Club." All I can say is
that my big moment has been getting to really know the Stanford sports
scene and report to you the important events like beating SC in the
Coliseum, the Cal basketball series, tin- final SC baseball games, and win
ning the Big Meet.

Well, gang, as the ancient Greek prophet once said, "Lot's have it around
Dip infield just one more time." And now as I sit down and one-finger
lype my way through the last column, I can realize what that old Daily
"■ports staff slogan really means.
Before this very moment, it was hard to figure out why the guys who
have gone on belore had such a tough time writing off sports here on The
Farm. Great guys like Johnny Hall, Bill Switrart, John Breier, Al Berry,
Boh Burristein, Dwight Wilbur, and Earl Odeil all put their skill to the task
of the last column and found it a difficult job. "After all," 1 used to say,
"It's just another good-bye."

But it's a iou&Ti ti.Tng io <w>. Before we gel to
crying towel stuff. I would like to make a couple
of strong requests. First o(T, I feel it only fitting that
the No. jersey never be worn again by a Stanford
gridder. The jersey of Big Bill McCoil should be
retired officially as soon as possible.
Next, let's win the Axe. The Class of '52 that is
soon to graduate is the only class in Stanford's his
tory not to have possession of the Big Game prize
at any time in the four vears. Chuck Taylor, with
the Indian eleven disqualified from Rose Howl play
next year, has set his main sight on winning the Big
One up in Berkeley. The Bears are going to lie
mighty tough to tame, but Chuck is the kind of
guy that can inspire his players to do the near im
possible.

Right about here it would be fitting to mention just a few of the athletes
tliiit will graduate with the Class of '.'52 who will always be standouts in any
history of Stanford sports. In football, there's Kill McColl, ol course; like
able, quarterbacking Gary Kerkorian; the. dependable ever-ready Dick
Horn; and gutty, heady Capt. Jesse Cone.
There's the senior trio on the basketball team —Jimmy Walsh, who
: tai led every game all four years; Eddie Tucker, the red-hot scoring sen
sation; and Capt. Jim Kamstcad, the big unassuming man who handled all
the rebound chores in fine fashion.
'1 hen the baseballers, Joe Che/, Artie Abrahamson, and I)ick Cor
yiti«\ who it their all to win another pennant before they left. And
. eet .swinging Dick McElyea and Keith Deekman in f.'oll; Tommy I.ivvyn
ami (ieorge Gentry on the tennis courts; and Bobby Frojen and liiuce I'ut
n.nti who have been champion paddlers all along. Missing from the thinclad
s<|iiad will be Capt. John Woolley, Wally McCamant, and Chuck Hokanson.
Hut the strange and wonderful thing about a place like Stanford is
that there are always new men ready to step into the shoes of the stars
who have graduated. Maybe at first, the shoes are a little too big, but
it isn't long before they're winning their own niches. And that's the way
it should he. *

The reason things work out so well and the reason Stanford athletes
will continue to be :o truly successful despite the lack of over-emphasis
is the men who man the coaching jobs. From top to bottom, no one could
find a higher-minded group of men.
There are the new ones just starting out in coaching like Chuck Taylor,
Boh Burnett, Bob Renker, Torn Haynie, and Bud Finger. The old-timers
like Everett Dsan and Husky Hunt. And then Jack Weiershauser who has
stuck with alma mater through thick and thin and does an amazing job
and who certainly deserves everybody's support on this Olympic trip.
Hp and down the line, each one of these men are just as interested
in winning the game, the meet, or the match as the next guy. But these
Stanford coaches mix in a good deal of sportsmanship and give-and-take
and all the things so important in sports and in life itself.
That leads up to my last request. My only advice to Larry and his
staff for Vol 122 is be loyal in your support of these men. Never be afraid
to criticize honestly, lor they demand it. But always shoot fair and square
with them.
So with that note, I'd like to say good-bye to Larry Calm, the new sports
editor; Pete Grothe, who'll double in brass as a member of SAB: Mike Hud
son, the whimsical Palo Alto philosopher; tricky Dick Malt/man; I'hil Her
man, the answer-man; and up-and-coming frosh Don Webster and Elmore
Seeds; and all the rest of The Sporting Gang. Good luck and have a great
year,
I guess the best way to end the Sporting Line is to recall a little story
lhat took place in Coach Dean's baseball methods class. Prof. Dean was
citing the Bobby Thompson homerun that won the National League pennant
for the Giants last year as one of the greatest moments in sports.
Dean asked his athletic-scholars if they could think of any other in
cident that compared with that for sheer drama, etc. All was quiet, and
then Boh Meyers raised his hand and sincerely stated, ''Yes, the time
tiiat I pule-vaulted II feet against the Olympic Club." All I can say is
that my big moment has been getting to really know the Stanford sports
scene and report to you the important events like beating SC in the
Coliseum, the Cal basketball series, tin- final SC baseball games, and win
ning the Big Meet.
