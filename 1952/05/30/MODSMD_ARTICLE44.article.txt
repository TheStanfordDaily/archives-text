# Review of Great Stanford Year

time to the land of the unbeatables,
Michigan. Well, the Cards, with the
Ketkorian to McCoil pass working
as never before, upset this favored
Michigan squad and when Stanford
hit campus Sunday they were re
garded with respect, wonder, and
some hope.
The UCLA Bruins came to the
Stadium and after a three year wait,
Stanford put together a te:'tn effort,
and gathered its fourth scalp of the
season. Santa Clara invaded and
after throwing a scare into the In
dians were beaten down 21-14.
Washington was a crucial, and the
Cards, traveling to Seattle, became a
definite Rose Bowl contender by
downing the Husky 14-7. Bob Ma
thins came into his own as a lull
back in sparking a late game Stan
ford drive.
After an unimpressive 21-13 win
over Washington State, the Indians

Stanford's athletic wheel of
fortune went spinning, spinning,
spinning and stopped with more
wins than losses for the Indian
[teams from fall through spring.
Actually we must go back to
early February when Chuck Taylor |
was signed as football coach. Then
it all began when the redhead start
ed building in spring practice. He
had a gang that was untried but |
willing.
I'oad lo the Bowl
The 1951 Cards traveled to Mult-
I nomah Stadium where they opened
I the season by downing Oregon 27-20.
I It wasn't a good start. The Indians
I returned home to scalp an uncle- |
j lea ted San Jose State squad, 2U-13,
1 and again failed to impress.
And then they were off again; this

traveled to Los Angeles for the ti
tanic with undefeated USC; And
what a ballgame it was. Ahead 7-0,
then behind by 14-7. Mathias runs
a kickofi back 96 yards and its 14-13;
USC recovers a fumble in the Stan
ford end zone for another six. 20-13
and minutes to play. A Kerkorian
to Sam Morley pass set up the tie,
and minutes later Skip Crist inter
cepted a Trojan pass and took it to
the SC two. Then it was dependable
Harry Hugasian carrying over for a
27-20 win. And the Indians returned
from the Southland victors and a two
inch Stanford Daily banner screamed
"8 IN A ROW—FUTURE ROSY."
And rosy it was. For the following
Saturday the Indians turned back an
Oregon State squad 35-14 and
cinched the Rose Bowl bid. But there
was still the Big Game. California
didn't disappoint. The Bears showed
up that memorable Saturday, Nov.
24 and quite business-like sat the
led-faced Indians on the baqk of
their red pants, 20-17. It marred a
beautiful .season.
But it was on to the Rose Bowl
and a date with Big Ten champ
Illinois. And again the Cards locked
something—drive, incentive, ability
—the experts say, but whatever, the
Illini after trailing 7-0 roared back
and mopped up the Stanford squad
40-7. The Indians left Pasadena so
fast that uniforms were left hang
ing in locker rooms for a month.
But, even on top of two disaster
ous defeats, the football world voted
Stanford's 31-year-old red-thatched
Chuck Taylor coach of the year.
Kail was Okay
And while football was the center
of Farm attention, other fall sports,
water polo, soccer and JV football
were getting their share of wins.
The water polo squad paced by
Bob Fiojen, did not lose a game. The
soccer squad won four and lost two
including a split with the Bears. '1 he
' JV footballers did not fare so well,
winning three while dropping three.
Bob in Charge
And while the gridders were being
mauled in the South, Bob Burnett
was taking over as head basketball
coach. Over the winter recess, the
! cagers compiled a clean slate against
local foes, but did not fare too well
in the Big Seven Tourney at Kan-
I s,as City. The Cards were breaking
adding machines with high point
totals, and PCC hopes were high.
But opening against UCLA the
Cards could only gain a split, and in
the following week against Cal the
Injuns split. And then the Indians
collapsed in that ill fated Southland
tour, losing a pair to the Trojans.
The cagers looked good drop
ping games to Stewart Chevrolet and
Phillips G(i. They were ready for the
second half of the Conference season.
And the Cards came along. Seniors
Ed Tucker, Jim Ramstead, Jim
Walsh and Frosh Ron Tomsic were
outstanding, but they could only win
four out of six and it wasn't good
enough for the title.
The Braves ended the cage season
with a good record.
Ray Lunny's boxing squad led by
Hob Baldocchi came up with a fail
record. The wrestlers didn't amaze
although Rod Garner, Jack Oglesby
and Phil Wilson impressed and
pinned.

And then it was spring. Everett
Dean's diamond crew went to work
on a long sked. The track team un
dertook a rugged schedule. The
baseballers came a long way after
starting slowly and ended the sea
son with 20 wins and 14 losses.
The Indians dropped a final two
game series to USC which cost them
the CIBA Hag. The Braves did even
better compiling 15 wins and only
five losses.
The track team which was not sup
posed to have much surprised and
took seven dual meets and only fell
to the perennial champs USC. The
Cards took second in the PCC last
weekend at Eugene and will win
their share of points in the NCAA.
The Injuns might surprise at the
Olympic trials. Bob Mathias was the
name and the star hut Reed, Simon,
Hertz, Long and numerous others all
did more than their share. The JV's
won seven dual meets.
Plenty of Champs
And in other sports Tom Haynie's
swimmers did not lose and swept the
PCC meat; the golfers romped, win
ning ten varsity matches and drop
ping two, plus capturing the North
ern California Intercollegiates and
the PCC. The golfers travel to the
NCAA at Purdue in June.
The tennis team ended with their
best post season record. And the
crews have whipped all competition
but California, the nation's best,
whom they go against tomorrow.
So the wheel of athletic fortune
is on its last spin with only a few
track meets and crew races left in a
year in which Lady Fortune smiled
approvingly on Farm athletic en
deavors.

outstanding, but they could only win
four out of six and it wasn't good
enough for the title.
The Braves ended the cage season
with a good record.
Ray Lunny's boxing squad led by
Hob Baldocchi came up with a fail
record. The wrestlers didn't amaze
although Rod Garner, Jack Oglesby
and Phil Wilson impressed and
pinned.

And then it was spring. Everett
Dean's diamond crew went to work
on a long sked. The track team un
dertook a rugged schedule. The
baseballers came a long way after
starting slowly and ended the sea
son with 20 wins and 14 losses.
The Indians dropped a final two
game series to USC which cost them
the CIBA Hag. The Braves did even
better compiling 15 wins and only
five losses.
The track team which was not sup
posed to have much surprised and
took seven dual meets and only fell
to the perennial champs USC. The
Cards took second in the PCC last
weekend at Eugene and will win
their share of points in the NCAA.
The Injuns might surprise at the
Olympic trials. Bob Mathias was the
name and the star hut Reed, Simon,
Hertz, Long and numerous others all
did more than their share. The JV's
won seven dual meets.
Plenty of Champs
And in other sports Tom Haynie's
swimmers did not lose and swept the
PCC meat; the golfers romped, win
ning ten varsity matches and drop
ping two, plus capturing the North
ern California Intercollegiates and
the PCC. The golfers travel to the
NCAA at Purdue in June.
The tennis team ended with their
best post season record. And the
crews have whipped all competition
but California, the nation's best,
whom they go against tomorrow.
So the wheel of athletic fortune
is on its last spin with only a few
track meets and crew races left in a
year in which Lady Fortune smiled
approvingly on Farm athletic en
deavors.

Michigan. Well, the Cards, with the
Ketkorian to McCoil pass working
as never before, upset this favored
Michigan squad and when Stanford
hit campus Sunday they were re
garded with respect, wonder, and
some hope.
The UCLA Bruins came to the
Stadium and after a three year wait,
Stanford put together a te:'tn effort,
and gathered its fourth scalp of the
season. Santa Clara invaded and
after throwing a scare into the In
dians were beaten down 21-14.
Washington was a crucial, and the
Cards, traveling to Seattle, became a
definite Rose Bowl contender by
downing the Husky 14-7. Bob Ma
thins came into his own as a lull
back in sparking a late game Stan
ford drive.
After an unimpressive 21-13 win
over Washington State, the Indians

Stanford's athletic wheel of
fortune went spinning, spinning,
spinning and stopped with more
wins than losses for the Indian
[teams from fall through spring.
Actually we must go back to
early February when Chuck Taylor |
was signed as football coach. Then
it all began when the redhead start
ed building in spring practice. He
had a gang that was untried but |
willing.
I'oad lo the Bowl
The 1951 Cards traveled to Mult-
I nomah Stadium where they opened
I the season by downing Oregon 27-20.
I It wasn't a good start. The Indians
I returned home to scalp an uncle- |
j lea ted San Jose State squad, 2U-13,
1 and again failed to impress.
And then they were off again; this

traveled to Los Angeles for the ti
tanic with undefeated USC; And
what a ballgame it was. Ahead 7-0,
then behind by 14-7. Mathias runs
a kickofi back 96 yards and its 14-13;
USC recovers a fumble in the Stan
ford end zone for another six. 20-13
and minutes to play. A Kerkorian
to Sam Morley pass set up the tie,
and minutes later Skip Crist inter
cepted a Trojan pass and took it to
the SC two. Then it was dependable
Harry Hugasian carrying over for a
27-20 win. And the Indians returned
from the Southland victors and a two
inch Stanford Daily banner screamed
"8 IN A ROW—FUTURE ROSY."
And rosy it was. For the following
Saturday the Indians turned back an
Oregon State squad 35-14 and
cinched the Rose Bowl bid. But there
was still the Big Game. California
didn't disappoint. The Bears showed
up that memorable Saturday, Nov.
24 and quite business-like sat the
led-faced Indians on the baqk of
their red pants, 20-17. It marred a
beautiful .season.
But it was on to the Rose Bowl
and a date with Big Ten champ
Illinois. And again the Cards locked
something—drive, incentive, ability
—the experts say, but whatever, the
Illini after trailing 7-0 roared back
and mopped up the Stanford squad
40-7. The Indians left Pasadena so
fast that uniforms were left hang
ing in locker rooms for a month.
But, even on top of two disaster
ous defeats, the football world voted
Stanford's 31-year-old red-thatched
Chuck Taylor coach of the year.
Kail was Okay
And while football was the center
of Farm attention, other fall sports,
water polo, soccer and JV football
were getting their share of wins.
The water polo squad paced by
Bob Fiojen, did not lose a game. The
soccer squad won four and lost two
including a split with the Bears. '1 he
' JV footballers did not fare so well,
winning three while dropping three.
Bob in Charge
And while the gridders were being
mauled in the South, Bob Burnett
was taking over as head basketball
coach. Over the winter recess, the
! cagers compiled a clean slate against
local foes, but did not fare too well
in the Big Seven Tourney at Kan-
I s,as City. The Cards were breaking
adding machines with high point
totals, and PCC hopes were high.
But opening against UCLA the
Cards could only gain a split, and in
the following week against Cal the
Injuns split. And then the Indians
collapsed in that ill fated Southland
tour, losing a pair to the Trojans.
The cagers looked good drop
ping games to Stewart Chevrolet and
Phillips G(i. They were ready for the
second half of the Conference season.
And the Cards came along. Seniors
Ed Tucker, Jim Ramstead, Jim
Walsh and Frosh Ron Tomsic were
outstanding, but they could only win
four out of six and it wasn't good
enough for the title.

didn't disappoint. The Bears showed
up that memorable Saturday, Nov.
24 and quite business-like sat the
led-faced Indians on the baqk of
their red pants, 20-17. It marred a
beautiful .season.
But it was on to the Rose Bowl
and a date with Big Ten champ
Illinois. And again the Cards locked
something—drive, incentive, ability
—the experts say, but whatever, the
Illini after trailing 7-0 roared back
and mopped up the Stanford squad
40-7. The Indians left Pasadena so
fast that uniforms were left hang
ing in locker rooms for a month.
But, even on top of two disaster
ous defeats, the football world voted
Stanford's 31-year-old red-thatched
Chuck Taylor coach of the year.
Kail was Okay
And while football was the center
of Farm attention, other fall sports,
water polo, soccer and JV football
were getting their share of wins.
The water polo squad paced by
Bob Fiojen, did not lose a game. The
soccer squad won four and lost two
including a split with the Bears. '1 he
' JV footballers did not fare so well,
winning three while dropping three.
Bob in Charge
And while the gridders were being
mauled in the South, Bob Burnett
was taking over as head basketball
coach. Over the winter recess, the
! cagers compiled a clean slate against
local foes, but did not fare too well
in the Big Seven Tourney at Kan-
I s,as City. The Cards were breaking
adding machines with high point
totals, and PCC hopes were high.
But opening against UCLA the
Cards could only gain a split, and in
the following week against Cal the
Injuns split. And then the Indians
collapsed in that ill fated Southland
tour, losing a pair to the Trojans.
The cagers looked good drop
ping games to Stewart Chevrolet and
Phillips G(i. They were ready for the
second half of the Conference season.
And the Cards came along. Seniors
Ed Tucker, Jim Ramstead, Jim
Walsh and Frosh Ron Tomsic were
outstanding, but they could only win
four out of six and it wasn't good
enough for the title.
The Braves ended the cage season
with a good record.
Ray Lunny's boxing squad led by
Hob Baldocchi came up with a fail
record. The wrestlers didn't amaze
although Rod Garner, Jack Oglesby
and Phil Wilson impressed and
pinned.

And then it was spring. Everett
Dean's diamond crew went to work
on a long sked. The track team un
dertook a rugged schedule. The
baseballers came a long way after
starting slowly and ended the sea
son with 20 wins and 14 losses.
The Indians dropped a final two
game series to USC which cost them
the CIBA Hag. The Braves did even
better compiling 15 wins and only
five losses.
The track team which was not sup
posed to have much surprised and
took seven dual meets and only fell
to the perennial champs USC. The
Cards took second in the PCC last
weekend at Eugene and will win
their share of points in the NCAA.
The Injuns might surprise at the
Olympic trials. Bob Mathias was the
name and the star hut Reed, Simon,
Hertz, Long and numerous others all
did more than their share. The JV's
won seven dual meets.
Plenty of Champs
And in other sports Tom Haynie's
swimmers did not lose and swept the
PCC meat; the golfers romped, win
ning ten varsity matches and drop
ping two, plus capturing the North
ern California Intercollegiates and
the PCC. The golfers travel to the
NCAA at Purdue in June.
The tennis team ended with their
best post season record. And the
crews have whipped all competition
but California, the nation's best,
whom they go against tomorrow.
So the wheel of athletic fortune
is on its last spin with only a few
track meets and crew races left in a
year in which Lady Fortune smiled
approvingly on Farm athletic en
deavors.

Michigan. Well, the Cards, with the
Ketkorian to McCoil pass working
as never before, upset this favored
Michigan squad and when Stanford
hit campus Sunday they were re
garded with respect, wonder, and
some hope.
The UCLA Bruins came to the
Stadium and after a three year wait,
Stanford put together a te:'tn effort,
and gathered its fourth scalp of the
season. Santa Clara invaded and
after throwing a scare into the In
dians were beaten down 21-14.
Washington was a crucial, and the
Cards, traveling to Seattle, became a
definite Rose Bowl contender by
downing the Husky 14-7. Bob Ma
thins came into his own as a lull
back in sparking a late game Stan
ford drive.
After an unimpressive 21-13 win
over Washington State, the Indians

Stanford's athletic wheel of
fortune went spinning, spinning,
spinning and stopped with more
wins than losses for the Indian
[teams from fall through spring.

I the season by downing Oregon 27-20.
I It wasn't a good start. The Indians

what a ballgame it was. Ahead 7-0,
then behind by 14-7. Mathias runs
a kickofi back 96 yards and its 14-13;
USC recovers a fumble in the Stan
ford end zone for another six. 20-13
and minutes to play. A Kerkorian
to Sam Morley pass set up the tie,
and minutes later Skip Crist inter
cepted a Trojan pass and took it to
the SC two. Then it was dependable
Harry Hugasian carrying over for a
27-20 win. And the Indians returned
from the Southland victors and a two
inch Stanford Daily banner screamed
"8 IN A ROW—FUTURE ROSY."
And rosy it was. For the following
Saturday the Indians turned back an
Oregon State squad 35-14 and

downing the Husky 14-7. Bob Ma
thins came into his own as a lull
back in sparking a late game Stan
ford drive.
After an unimpressive 21-13 win
over Washington State, the Indians

Stanford's athletic wheel of
fortune went spinning, spinning,
spinning and stopped with more
wins than losses for the Indian
[teams from fall through spring.
Actually we must go back to
early February when Chuck Taylor |
was signed as football coach. Then
it all began when the redhead start
ed building in spring practice. He
had a gang that was untried but |
willing.
I'oad lo the Bowl
The 1951 Cards traveled to Mult-
I nomah Stadium where they opened
I the season by downing Oregon 27-20.
I It wasn't a good start. The Indians
I returned home to scalp an uncle- |
j lea ted San Jose State squad, 2U-13,
1 and again failed to impress.
And then they were off again; this

traveled to Los Angeles for the ti
tanic with undefeated USC; And
what a ballgame it was. Ahead 7-0,
then behind by 14-7. Mathias runs
a kickofi back 96 yards and its 14-13;
USC recovers a fumble in the Stan
ford end zone for another six. 20-13
and minutes to play. A Kerkorian
to Sam Morley pass set up the tie,
and minutes later Skip Crist inter
cepted a Trojan pass and took it to
the SC two. Then it was dependable
Harry Hugasian carrying over for a
27-20 win. And the Indians returned
from the Southland victors and a two
inch Stanford Daily banner screamed
"8 IN A ROW—FUTURE ROSY."
And rosy it was. For the following
Saturday the Indians turned back an
Oregon State squad 35-14 and
cinched the Rose Bowl bid. But there
was still the Big Game. California
didn't disappoint. The Bears showed
up that memorable Saturday, Nov.
24 and quite business-like sat the
led-faced Indians on the baqk of
their red pants, 20-17. It marred a
beautiful .season.
But it was on to the Rose Bowl
and a date with Big Ten champ
Illinois. And again the Cards locked
something—drive, incentive, ability
—the experts say, but whatever, the
Illini after trailing 7-0 roared back
and mopped up the Stanford squad
40-7. The Indians left Pasadena so
fast that uniforms were left hang
ing in locker rooms for a month.
But, even on top of two disaster
ous defeats, the football world voted
Stanford's 31-year-old red-thatched
Chuck Taylor coach of the year.
Kail was Okay
And while football was the center
of Farm attention, other fall sports,
water polo, soccer and JV football
were getting their share of wins.
The water polo squad paced by
Bob Fiojen, did not lose a game. The
soccer squad won four and lost two
including a split with the Bears. '1 he
' JV footballers did not fare so well,
winning three while dropping three.
Bob in Charge
And while the gridders were being
mauled in the South, Bob Burnett
was taking over as head basketball
coach. Over the winter recess, the
! cagers compiled a clean slate against
local foes, but did not fare too well
in the Big Seven Tourney at Kan-
I s,as City. The Cards were breaking
adding machines with high point
totals, and PCC hopes were high.
But opening against UCLA the
Cards could only gain a split, and in
the following week against Cal the
Injuns split. And then the Indians
collapsed in that ill fated Southland
tour, losing a pair to the Trojans.
The cagers looked good drop
ping games to Stewart Chevrolet and
Phillips G(i. They were ready for the
second half of the Conference season.
And the Cards came along. Seniors
Ed Tucker, Jim Ramstead, Jim
Walsh and Frosh Ron Tomsic were
outstanding, but they could only win
four out of six and it wasn't good
enough for the title.
The Braves ended the cage season
with a good record.
Ray Lunny's boxing squad led by
Hob Baldocchi came up with a fail
record. The wrestlers didn't amaze
although Rod Garner, Jack Oglesby
and Phil Wilson impressed and
pinned.

And then it was spring. Everett
Dean's diamond crew went to work
on a long sked. The track team un
dertook a rugged schedule. The
baseballers came a long way after
starting slowly and ended the sea
son with 20 wins and 14 losses.
The Indians dropped a final two
game series to USC which cost them
the CIBA Hag. The Braves did even
better compiling 15 wins and only
five losses.
The track team which was not sup
posed to have much surprised and
took seven dual meets and only fell
to the perennial champs USC. The
Cards took second in the PCC last
weekend at Eugene and will win
their share of points in the NCAA.
The Injuns might surprise at the
Olympic trials. Bob Mathias was the
name and the star hut Reed, Simon,
Hertz, Long and numerous others all
did more than their share. The JV's
won seven dual meets.
Plenty of Champs
And in other sports Tom Haynie's
swimmers did not lose and swept the
PCC meat; the golfers romped, win
ning ten varsity matches and drop
ping two, plus capturing the North
ern California Intercollegiates and
the PCC. The golfers travel to the
NCAA at Purdue in June.
The tennis team ended with their
best post season record. And the
crews have whipped all competition
but California, the nation's best,
whom they go against tomorrow.
So the wheel of athletic fortune
is on its last spin with only a few
track meets and crew races left in a
year in which Lady Fortune smiled
approvingly on Farm athletic en
deavors.

time to the land of the unbeatables,
Michigan. Well, the Cards, with the
Ketkorian to McCoil pass working
as never before, upset this favored
Michigan squad and when Stanford
hit campus Sunday they were re
garded with respect, wonder, and
some hope.
The UCLA Bruins came to the
Stadium and after a three year wait,
Stanford put together a te:'tn effort,
and gathered its fourth scalp of the
season. Santa Clara invaded and
after throwing a scare into the In
dians were beaten down 21-14.
Washington was a crucial, and the
Cards, traveling to Seattle, became a
definite Rose Bowl contender by
downing the Husky 14-7. Bob Ma
thins came into his own as a lull
