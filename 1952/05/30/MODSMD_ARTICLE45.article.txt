# '51-'52: Roses, Ratios and Raids
## 
### SUE WHEAT 
With sheepskin time only two
busy weeks away, it seems im
possible that it was nine months
ago when the class of '55
rammed into the traditional reg
lines ol the Pavilion.
But cram they did, the bigge: I
clas» ever, to swell fall quarter's
enrollment to 7,. r >l4. (Roughs re
juiced hi the ratio fell, giving I h m
each one-tenth of a woman more

I than they had previously had.)
To start the year off, Stanford's
| football team proceeded to win its
I name , with amazing regularity.
Spirit began to soar, reaching a
, lung-breaking peak one November
weekend in the Los Angelas Coli
j scum when an inspired Stanford
eleven defeated strong USC, 27 to
| 20.
While 4,000 jubilant rooters
shrieked themselves hoarse in the
| southland, students at home hurled
beer bottles, overturned tables, and
' danced in glee at RossolU s.
Just one week later (iie bubble

A welcome newcomer to campus
publications was "Viewpoint," a
j higher - brow magazine containing
non - fiction articles, stories, and
poems. Under the editorship of
j Bud McCord, two editions hit the
| newsstands.
Warren G. Wonka (who was born
not in Watsonville but in a Chappie
ioke about 12 years ago) was quite
active this year. Besides taking an
incomplete in Physics 131, and re
ceiving letters from Senator Kefau
ver, Wonka was reported by the
Associated Press to be one of the
Stanford band members who "nar
rowly escaped serio-is injury" when
j involved in an ar • dent driving
north to the Washington football
j game.
ASSU Excom, meanwhile, consid
] ered the more serious questions
that faced Stanford students: Should
political speakers be allowed on
campus? Should the unrealistic

liquor laws be protested? Aren't
the concepts of tlie Fundamental
Standard, Honor Code, and lone
woman rule due for re-evaluation?
"Yes" was Stanford's answer to
these problems. Lxcom passed a
resolution allowing political speak
ers on campus; recommended 18 a.s
a legal age for the drinking of beer
and wine; and considered the re
sults of polls indicating student
opinion on the Standard, Honor
Code, and Social Rules.
Almost 8,0110 students jammed
Mom And one afternoon to find
o«it from l)r. Kinsey if they were
sexually "normal" or not. Most
of them left unconvinced, unin
formed. and amused.
It was a "give" year for Stanford
as Con Home work day, Red Cross
Drives, and relief drives hit stu
dents for their sweat,, blood, and
money respectively. Blood dona
tions totaled 450 pints in the spring
drive and a record $0,000 was col
lected for the Con Home kids.
"Desire Under the Elms," and
"Billy Budd" were just two of the
Stanford Players' successful pro
ductions, and Ram's Head's spring
show of "Finian's Rainbow" was
termed a "triumph."
Dr. Douglas Whitaker was made
Stanford's second ranking admin
istrative officer, or provost, as the
new post is called, and Fred (Ho
ver, in becoming assistant to the
president, turned his job of Di
rector of Information over to Pete
Allen.
Stanford students proved them

selves not so different after all as
they succumbed to the contagious
fever of the nationwide "panty
raids." Unorganized, spasmodic in
vasions of Roble, Uranner, and
Hurlburt resulted in $700 worth of
damage and passed on, leaving the
campus wilh a iceimg of sheepish
disgust.
And that's ."<0 for 121.


"FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT!" — Pandemonium broke loose in the
Stanford rooting section at the Los Angeles Coliseum last fall
as Matliias ran 96 yards for a touchdown and the Indians axed

"Yes" was Stanford's answer to

a legal age for the drinking of beer
