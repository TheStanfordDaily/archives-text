### 
■JTlve third and final round of Cal's
heated ASUC elections finally pro
duced a decisive winner, Dick HoJ- 1
ler, who soundly trounced his com
petitor Dick Parker in Wednesday's
runoff election.
In Cal's second attempt to choose
a student body president, Holler left
little room for the voting to be con
tested as he attracted a total of
2,456 votes to Parker's 1,307.
In the original election Holler had
a margin of only 10 votes over Par- j
ker, and that was reversed by a j
recount which gave Parker a 27-
yote lead.
ASUC Excom invalidated the first
election and called the second for
yesterday when its Judiciary Com
mittee found that, fraud had been a
"physical possibility" in the voting.
When contacted last night, the
Daily Cal could offer 110 explana
tion of the decisive majority Holler
polled in the final analysis, except
to state that it might have been a !
reaction to the adverse news cre
ated by the first confused balloting.
