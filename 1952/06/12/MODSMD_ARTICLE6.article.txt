# Good Luck '52
## 
### 
To the Class of '52:
Four years have gone by, our undergraduate college
days are over, and we are looking forward to what the
future will bring. Some are looking forward to mar
riage, others to careers in education or business, and
many of the fellows to a tour of duty in one of the
services. A few of us will even return to graduate
schools here and at other universities.
As we go our separate ways in each walk of life,
there is one memory and one feeling of pride that will
remain. The memory will be of our days as students,
and the feeling of pride will be of our Alma Mater,
Stanford. We have attended one of the finest schools
in the country and are proud of it. A degree from
Stanford is one that represents a good education con
ducted on an intelligent level.
Some of us will want to use our degrees as a key
for opening the door to jobs; for others, the diploma
is only evidence of the excellent education they have
received. There is one thing to remember about the
degree, no matter what you want it for: It is outstand
ing only as long as Stanford is outstanding. If at any
time the reputation of this University, academically,
socially, or in any other way, should fall to the level

of a lesser school, the distinction of a Stanford degree
either now or in the past would cease to be.
We, as alumni, will have no hand in determining
the program or policies of the University, but leave it
in the very capable hands of President Sterling and the
administration. However, we can do our part by giv
ing aid when asked by the University. Stanford relies
on its alumni both morally and financially for help in
continuing to maintain the high standards of the Uni
versity. Last year over 9,0(J0 alumni gave Stanford
almost $350,000. They did this through the Stanford
Fund. After graduation we will receive letters from
the Fund reporting progress at the University and re
questing our support. I strongly urge you to remember
your school.
Being president of the Class of 1952 has been such
an honor to me that I am unable to express my grati
tude to you in words. I do say to you though that I
hope that I have fulfilled my office in a manner com
mensurate with your expectations when you elected
me. As your permanent president, I shall do my best
to reunite the class as often as possible. Until our first
reunion as Alumni, I say to you all. good bye, and good
luck. KEITH BEEKMAN
Class President '52
