# New Students Welcomed to Stanford
## 
### Dr. Sterling ASSU Prexy 
As the summer quarter opens, we
have many old friends with us. We
have also the pleasure of extending
a hearty welcome to new faculty
members and to students enrolled
at Stanford for the first time.
This will be a busy quarter, with
possibly the heaviest schedule of
conferences and oth?v business and
cultural events that the University
lias had for many years.
1 should like to encourage stu
dents to take advantage of the op
portunities oft'cr d by these gather
ings of experts. The conferences
offer unusual opportunity for learn
ing in many varied fields.
Although vacation plars and Uni
versity business will take me and
my family away from the ccmpus
during part of the quarter, I hope
thst my wife an J I will be able to
meet many of you during your
Stanford stay.

To the Summer Student Body:
I feel we are very fortunate to be
pre c ent at Stanford this summer
and to be able to take advantage of
the many opportunities which our
Stanford summer affords. I wish to
extend the greetings of the Execu
tive ComrnittL'tt, the vice-president.
! and myself to all of you, and par

ticularly to our newer members.
During summer quarter, more
emphasis is laid upon social activi
ties of a school-wide nature than
during the normal academic year.
With a smaller student body and
smaller residence units, summer
quarter gives us a chance to com
bine our resources and ideas and
establish a more closely knit unit.
You may have heard some express
the widely held opinion that "sum-

mer quarter is the best time to be
at Stanford"; and I believe that it
is the unique social arrangement
which creates this impression.
You have undoubtedly noticed
many new names and faces among
the faculty ranks in your class
rooms. Stanford takes great pride
in the fact that professors and in
structors are drawn from all ever
the nation, from the greatest col
leges and universities, to be here
lor summer quarter.
Due io many inquiries and re
quests, a reception has been ar
ranged for Tuesday at 4 in the af
ternoon in Lagunitff Court, so that
we will all be able to talk with
these people and Dr. and Mrs. Ster
ling. and enable them to become
more familiar with us. I urge ev
eryone to attend, for it is an oppor
tunity that may arise only this once
during the entire summer.
I would also like to say that our
Excom meetings, which are held in
the Union Wednesday nights at
7:''>o. are open to the entire student
bod} - ; and I not only invite, but
encourage all those interested in the
student government and activities
to attend when they are able.
The vice - president, Meredith
! Magnus, and myself will hold office
hours five days a week in the Union
for any suggestions or inquiries
i which anyone might wish to make.
Here's to the best summer quar
ter cf them all.

Summer ASSU President
