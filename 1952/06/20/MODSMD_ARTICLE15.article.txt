# OUTSIDE STANFORD
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
! It's Off to Europe
'With a Rand-McNaliy road map under one arm, a typewriter under
the other, and saying "Taft isolationism be damned," I depart for Europe.
The reason I mention this is that the summer Daily will be the vehicle

for a series of articles called "Outside Stanford" (the
sequel to "Insic'e U.S.A.").
Two other Stanford students whom I'll refer to
from time to time in this column, Stan and Herb, will
accompany me. We sail from New York on July 3
on the maiden voyage of the SS United States and
will travel through France, Finland, Austria, Ger
many, Switzerland, Italy, England, and other coun
tries.
I won't attempt an erudite appraisal of Europe in
these articles. They merely will be the observations
of a neophyte traveler. They'll be on the light side
with just enough of the serious to provide an occa-

sional change of pace.
This series on ''Outside Stanford" will also include sports. We'll be
|fn Helsinki and will be able to report on how Bob Mathias, Sharon Geary,
ana other Stanford entrants do in the most fabulous of all sporting
Events . . . the Olympic Games.
•, few of these articles may concern themselves with Senator MeCar
fhv's favorite word . . . Communism. One of the persons I'm staying
\vith at the Press Hotel in Helsinki is a gentleman named Lester Rodney.
' ) i'm told is sports editor of the Daily Worker. Also. I'll drive through
90 -niles ol' Russian territory to get to Vienna and then to Communist
Jugoslavia.
The Ugliest Wor/1
i 7 ou notice that I have been religiously avoiding one of the ugliest
words in the English language . . . tourist. We shall avoid tourists like
ia plague and try to stay away from those places where tourists are so thick
,that. they keep getting in each other's snapshots.
would characterize the typical tourists as people who go to only
•♦hose places that are recommended on the guide map. stay at hotels where
fr-TJv other Americans stay, eat where only other Americans eat, sit in
■tho "oom half the day and play bridge, and then come home and tell
■their friends they have seen Europe.
Ve won't actually arrive in Europe untii July 8, but we will send in
a few communiques en route to our first stop, Paris.
x nd so with a Rand-McNally road map under one arm, a typewriter
tii r'er the other, and a saying of "Taft isolationism be damned" on my
. ips, I'm off. Stick around. It might prove interesting.

The Ugliest Wor/1
i 7 ou notice that I have been religiously avoiding one of the ugliest
words in the English language . . . tourist. We shall avoid tourists like
ia plague and try to stay away from those places where tourists are so thick
,that. they keep getting in each other's snapshots.
would characterize the typical tourists as people who go to only
•♦hose places that are recommended on the guide map. stay at hotels where
fr-TJv other Americans stay, eat where only other Americans eat, sit in

■their friends they have seen Europe.
Ve won't actually arrive in Europe untii July 8, but we will send in

! It's Off to Europe
'With a Rand-McNaliy road map under one arm, a typewriter under
the other, and saying "Taft isolationism be damned," I depart for Europe.
The reason I mention this is that the summer Daily will be the vehicle

for a series of articles called "Outside Stanford" (the
sequel to "Insic'e U.S.A.").
Two other Stanford students whom I'll refer to
from time to time in this column, Stan and Herb, will
accompany me. We sail from New York on July 3
on the maiden voyage of the SS United States and
will travel through France, Finland, Austria, Ger
many, Switzerland, Italy, England, and other coun
tries.
I won't attempt an erudite appraisal of Europe in
these articles. They merely will be the observations
of a neophyte traveler. They'll be on the light side
with just enough of the serious to provide an occa-

sional change of pace.
