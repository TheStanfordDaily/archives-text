## 
### 
A new kind of course in school
planning, tailored to meet the needs
of busy educators, has been an
nounced by Professor James D.
MacConnell, director of the Stan
ford School of Education's School
Pianning Laboratory.
Many teaehers and school staff
members cannot leave their jobs
long enough to attend the regular
four-to-eight-week summer session
of the laboratory. Instead, they may
now receive "capsule" presentations
of the courses by attending—free of
tuition fees—a series of six School
Planning Conferences to be held on
successive Fridays during July and
August.
Students taking the regular
courses of the laboratory may en
roll for periods of four to eight
weeks during the summer session,
June 23 to Aug. 10. They will also
attend the special Friday confer
ences, which will be held July 11,
13, and 25, and Aug. 1. 8, and 15.
Both groups will receive instruc
tion from specialists in business and
industry as well as from Stanford
School of Education faculty mem
bers.
No charge will be made except
for those who wish to receive credit
for the '"capsule" courses, Dr. Mac-
Connell said. An illustrated report
on the proceedings of the classes
and conference meetings will be
issued after the summer session is
concluded.
