SAN FRANCISCO, June 19 (UP)
â€”Vice-Adm. C. Turner Joy said to
day the Korean armi tice talks
were valuable to the United Na
tions in that they proved once and
for all that, the Communists are
"ruthless" individuals who recog
nize only "unmistakable firmness
and applied military strength."
The former chief delegate of the

United Nations truce team at Pan
munjom said on his arrival here j
aboard the military transport Gen.
H. W. Butner that the original Al
lied assumption that the Reds would
bargain in good faith gave the en- 1
emy opportunity to use the talks as I
a "tactial maneuver to build up
their forces" in North Korea.
General James A. Van Fleet. '

Eighth Army commander in Korea,
said recently that the Communists
had in the past few months built up
their fighting strength to a point
where they out - numbered UN
forces by two and ons-half to one.
