# Crew Given Slim Chance at Syracuse
## 
### 
Stanford's very, very dark
horse crew squares off against
. 0 of the best college boatings in i
the nation tomorrow afternoon
j'n the sGth Annual Intercollegi
r.le Rowing Association Champ
ionship Regatta.
The Indians have drawn lane num- j
Itr one in the three-mile race, j
/r.oved to Syracuse, New York, this
year for the first time.

Wisconsin and Navy are co-fav
i orites in the event, a preliminary to
;he Olympic Trials, with Cal. Wash
; ington. and Princeton also rated
j strong contenders for the national
| rowing championship.
Despite the fact that the Cards
I have received almost no press men
j tion as a contender for the crown.
Bob White's lads can't be counted
| out.
In the first place White is coach
ing on experienced boating. Out of

eight oarsmen and the cox, five
Cards who made the trip east have
rowed in the regatta previously.
Granted also that after subduing
USC, UCLA, and OSC handily, the
Indians tied up against Cal both at
the Newport Sprint Championships
where Bill Allen caught a crab: and
in the dual meet race on the Oakland
Estuary.
Nevertheless, White has been
pointing all the while for the Syra
cuse Regatta; this trick he learned
while coxing for Cal's great Ky Eb
right. In the big cne watch for the
Cards.
White will make up his. boating
out of twelve oarsmen he took east.
Two of these. Jim Fifer and Dewey
Hecht. are definite alternates and
will row only if needed because of
injury, etc.
Of the other's. Allen, tr.llcst man on
the crew at 6' 6," Sam Stearns, Ken
Lewis (capt.), Jerry Thursby, and
Phil West are fairly definite starters.
Though the crew is still several
hundred dollars short of its fund
raising goal, it plans to go on to the
Olympic Trials at Worcester, Mass.
