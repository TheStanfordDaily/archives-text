# Strong Stanford Golf Team Rated Only Second in NCAA Tourney
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
Stanford's golfers will seek
their sixth NCAA golf title when
the National Intercollegiate Golf
Tournament begins tomorrow
morning on the Purdue Univer
sity course at Lafayette, Indiana.
This year's golf team has compiled
a great record. They won 11 out of
13 dual meets. Their two losses
were an early season closie to a
star - studded Olympic Club squad
and an defeat by San Jose
State.
They defeated San Jose when the
two schools met in a rematch. Stan
ford handed the strong USC and
UCLA teams two murderous 45 to
i) beatings on the southern schools'
home courses. The Cards also shel
lacked Cal twice.
The golfers swept all honors in
the Northern California Intercol
legiate meet, with Card ace Fred
Brown winning the individual
frown. Their outstanding per
formance of the season, thus far,
however, came in the I'CC meet
when they won the team trophy
with an all - time low of 587
strokes.
Coach Bud Finger, however,
rates their chances of winning the
national crown about one in
twenty. The reason for his gloom
can be summed up in three words
—North Texas State.
Whereas Stanford has a strong
team, North Texas State has as
sembled a super team.
National Amateur champion
Bill Maxwell leads the Staters,
joe Conrad and Don January,
who competed in last week's Na
tional Open, are two more North
Texas greats. Buster Reid and
l.em Cronell, two-time winner of
the Trans - Mississippi tourney,
also shoot on this all-star aggre
gation.
Stanford rates as second favorite
in the tourney, although LSU and
the host Purdue squad also figure
very strong.
Ifere is a rundown on the men
representing Stanford.
Fred Brown is rated by Coach
Finger as "one of the greatest 18-
year - old golfers in the world."
Brown shot 142 for 3G holes in the
PCC tourney to tie the all - time
medalist record. He defeated Na
tional Public Links champion Dave
Stanley of UCLA and split with San
Jose's great Ken Venturi in dual
meet competition. This placid-look
ins; freshman seems destined to
rate with Lawson Little, Charley
Seaver, aud the other all-time
Stanford greats.
Captain Dick McElyea is one of
the steadiest golfers ever to grace
the Stanford course. Although* he
is the shortest hitter on the team,
he more than makes up for it with

his come - through ability undei
pressure. He was Pacific Coasl
champion ...in 1950.
Warren "Dailey rates as one ol
the longest hitlers in golf. Finger
guarantees, he hits as long a ball a k
Sam Snead or Jimmy Thompson
With a little wind ancl roll, he car,
clout the ball over 350 yards. "II
he can ever steady down, he will be
unbeatable, 0 Finger says.
Grant Spaeth is another 300-yard
plus He dropped off the
starting tdam in mid-season, but
has come roaring back and his 14b
in the PCC's was the key to Stan
lord's record win.
Dick Taylor is the most experi
enced golfer on the term. and yet
he is the most erratic. However, he
seems on his game now ancl in last
month's 72 s Tiole play-off for start
ing insured his place
on the teyfi with a sensational 285.
Keith rounds out the
squad. year's number six

LONG BALL HITTER—Grant Spaeth, Stanford golfer and son of
the Law School Dean, tees off in practice. Spaeth, number four
man on the Cards NCAA contending outfit, smacks the ball over
300 yards on his drives.
