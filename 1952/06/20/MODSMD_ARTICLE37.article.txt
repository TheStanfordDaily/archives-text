BROOKLYN, June 19 (UP) —
Dodger pitcher Carl Frskine forgot
about point and concen
trated on" "Tiis weakness today to
pitch a no-hit, no-run 5-0 victory
over the Cubs and miss out on a
perfect game only because he "was
in a huri'y to beat the rain."
Erskine has often been told by
Manager Charley Dressen that his
only failing is a lack of control; yet
today his control was nigh-perfect
as he needed only 103 pitches—only
40 of them-iballs. He is considered
the best change-up pitcher in base
ball; yet h€P-ttsed that pitch only once.
The game was held up 44 minutes
by rain after the third inning, and
that made the Erskine performance
even because such a
delay usually tightens a pitcher's
arm.
