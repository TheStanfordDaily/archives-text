# Coaching Clinic Closes Today
## 
### 
After featuring half the major
coaches on the west roast in an in
tensive three day session, Stanford's
sixth annual coaching clinic will pick
up its marbles following this after
noon's closing session.
Around a hundred high school and
JC coaches are attending the clinic
and taking a refresher on the fine
points of the gridiron sport from such
outstanding men as Chuck Taylor
and his entire staff, Pop Warner,
Lynn Waldorf, Kip Taylor, and Dick
Gallagher.
