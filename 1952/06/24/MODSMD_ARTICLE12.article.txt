TOKYO. Tuesday, June 24 (UP)
â€”Allied planes blacked out North
Korea and much of Manchuria yes
terday with mass bombing attacks
on five hydroeelctric plants on the
Yalu River border of Manchuria
and in northeast Korea.
More than 500 Air Force, Marine,
and Navy bombers joined forces in
the biggest attack of the war and
left in flaming ruins stations that
supply 90 per cent of the Commu
nists' electric power and are vital to
Chinese industry in Manchuria.
Far East Air Force and Fifth Air
Force spokesmen said that orders
to bomb the plants came from
"higher up."
No enemy planes attacked the
Allies during the hour and a half
of concentrated attack by armor
piercing bombs and rockets, and not
an Allied plane was lost. The at
tacking force could see hundreds of
idle enemy MlG's which never left
the ground.
