# Sen. Taft Rolls Up Delegates; Eisenhower Aides Cry 'Steal'
## 
### HADLEY ROFF Daily Political Editor 
The bunting is now being tacked to the walls of the giant Chicago audi
torium where, beginning July 7, the Republicans will gather to name their
(standard bearer.
But while Chicago makes ready, one candidate, the balding senior
Senator from Ohio, Robert Alphonso Taft, is making a final check on one
iof the most powerful political steamrollers ever assembled.
At the moment it seems that with that steamroller Taft will charge
tc victory at the convention without too much difficulty.
There is no question that within the last month Taft has proved him
self one of the most adroit politicians ever to help fill backrooms with
smoke.
Taft certainly has shown himself to he a master manipulator of con
ventions, for during the last month he lias snagged some 100 delegates
without trouble. Those delegates were won in neatly planned state con
ventions where Taft slates were nominated and elected with only weak
protest from Eisenhower forces.
The only time the Eisenhower troops squawked bitterly was in Texas
last month when one of the most controversial and ugly of intra-party
fights developed.
It seems that representatives favoring Eisenhower were barred from
•the convention and that Taft men were named in their stead. Thus, de
spite the howling protest ol Ike-men. Taft waltzed from the convention
with 38 easily won delegates.
Io justity its action the convention's pro-Taft steering committee de
clared that the Ike representatives were not true Republicans. "They're
really Democrats in disgui.se," the committeemen asserted.
Eisenhower and his supporters ried "steal.'' And the general ripped into
the Texas deal in his now famous Detroit speech. He charged that corrup
tion must be wiped from "government, the primaries, and from party
•conventions—even those in my home state of Texas."
Public indignation over the issue boiled and Taft took immediate no
tice, particularly when many of the nation's weightier publications—in
cluding the New York Times and Time magazine—hinted that many of
the delegate deals were grimed with graft. It was pointed out that many
of the county chairmen at the Texas meet switched suddenly from Ike
to Taft after being approached by Taft's Texas campaign boss. Ilenrv
Zvveifel.
laft, last Wednesday, waved the white flag, offering to turn the con
vention squabble over to the GOP National Committee for final decision.
But it seems apparent that laft controls the National Committee. That
piemise was supported last week with the selection ol General Douglas
ardent Taft champion, as keynoter at the national conclave.
MacArtliur, in a speech in Detroit late "in May, attempted to skin Ei
senhower. saying that a military man should never be President. He said,
never mentioning Eisenhower by name, that the United States could
easily be converted into a military state if a military man were elected
chief executive.
Eisenhower, a former aide to Mac Arthur, and his backers stormed,
'pleading with National Committee members to thumbs-down the recom
■mendation. The committee, however, in an almost unanimous vote, sin
gled Mac Arthur for the key-noter honor.
Such Taft influence is indicative of the strength of the campaign he
lias waged. To be sure, Taft hasn't appealed too successfully to the avei
igc \ oter, but he has managed to wangle support from most of the partv
bigwigs.
Since his return, Eisenhower has failed to pick up any significant
delegations though he has anxiously wooed the still independent Penn
sylvania host.
'laft has been luckier, as the winning of the 100 delegates within the
month has indicated.
At present count Taft has a 73-delegate margin over Eisenhower, a
margin that will grow within the week as tallies from state conventions
.n Louisiana, Georgia, and Mississippi are counted. All those states are
known to be in Taft's camp.
According to press association dispatches Taft has 466 delegates. Eisen-
Jiower has 393. Warren has 76 and Stassen 25. At the national conven
tion bU4 votes are needed for the nomination.
