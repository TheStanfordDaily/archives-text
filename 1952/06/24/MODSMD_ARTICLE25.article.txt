Conference Conference

The PCC get-together of a week or so back has been pretty well
hashed out, but a couple of items are still pertinent to campus chatter.
One of these is the booster club situation in which the conference high
mucky-mucks called upon the various schools to demand that their re
spective booster clubs (sometimes referred to as "athlete buying co-oper
atives") open up their books for examination or face conference investi
gation.
When the roll call came around to Stanford, Director of Athletics A 1
Masters was able to /«ay that not only are the Buck Club's books open
now, but that they were open as long as three years ago.
Moreover, the fact that all Buck Club money is spent for tuition only
and that it is administered through the University itself gives Stanford
about as clean a bill of health in the booster club department as possible
during these days of professionalish athletics.
The second bit concerns the conference reversing its field like a scared
scatback as regards the principle of out-of-season practice. Six months
ago the PCC ruled against spring basketball practice. A week ago the
same PCC ruled in favor of it, but attempted to continue the principle
of "de-ernphasis" by limiting the number of practice sessions to 20.
Bosh!!! Spring practice is spring practice. And it doe-n't fit in with
the idea of playing college sports for the fun of it. When, in order to stay
in competition, a coach is forced to develop such a highly polished team
that he requires year-around participation, it takes the fun out of play
ing. What about the basketballer who wants to run track, swim, or just
t.ke it easy during the off season?
What we say about the casaba game goes just as well for any other
(here's where we lose a few more friends) —football, soccer, or any other
sport. Down with organized, full-scale, required or semi-required spring
practice. For inexperienced players, however it does seem reasonable
to permit and encourage elementary classes in the various sports.
From the Notebook
Jess Cone, co-captain and defensive guard on last fall's gridiron outfit,
has been named head football coach at the new Capucliino High School
in San Bruno.
A member of Sigma Chi, the SAB, and the Block ' S" Society at Stan
ford, Cone and his wife will move to San Bruno sometime in August or
September.
.Capuchino, only two years old, will move into PAL competition for
the first time next fall, and it's reported to be loaded.
Shipstad and Johnson's Ice Follies is currently in the city, so we said
to hell with the summer budget and went the other night. Sportswriters
have been arguing since ice was invented whether or not the skate shows
are athletics or legit theater stuff. We're still straddling the fence. If you
like muscals, the producton numbers are tops. If you can appreciate good
skating Frick and Frack. Marine Miller and Dick Dwyer. the Scotvold
Twins, and Phyllis and Harris Legg shouldn't be missed. Either way the
show's worth the throw.
Comes the funeral dirge!! San Diego's losing six out of seven and its
.old on first place to Hollywood last week should bring forth the annual
cry that the Pads are commencing their annual march to the League
cellar. Despite having heard and watched same for fifteen years now.
we'll hold off for another couple of weeks before we say O'Doul's men
are through. After all. rain finally fell on California this vear.

From the Notebook
Jess Cone, co-captain and defensive guard on last fall's gridiron outfit,
has been named head football coach at the new Capucliino High School
in San Bruno.
A member of Sigma Chi, the SAB, and the Block ' S" Society at Stan
ford, Cone and his wife will move to San Bruno sometime in August or
September.
.Capuchino, only two years old, will move into PAL competition for
the first time next fall, and it's reported to be loaded.
Shipstad and Johnson's Ice Follies is currently in the city, so we said
to hell with the summer budget and went the other night. Sportswriters
have been arguing since ice was invented whether or not the skate shows
are athletics or legit theater stuff. We're still straddling the fence. If you
like muscals, the producton numbers are tops. If you can appreciate good
skating Frick and Frack. Marine Miller and Dick Dwyer. the Scotvold
Twins, and Phyllis and Harris Legg shouldn't be missed. Either way the
show's worth the throw.
Comes the funeral dirge!! San Diego's losing six out of seven and its
.old on first place to Hollywood last week should bring forth the annual
cry that the Pads are commencing their annual march to the League
cellar. Despite having heard and watched same for fifteen years now.
we'll hold off for another couple of weeks before we say O'Doul's men
are through. After all. rain finally fell on California this vear.
Conference Conference

The PCC get-together of a week or so back has been pretty well
hashed out, but a couple of items are still pertinent to campus chatter.
One of these is the booster club situation in which the conference high
mucky-mucks called upon the various schools to demand that their re
spective booster clubs (sometimes referred to as "athlete buying co-oper
atives") open up their books for examination or face conference investi
gation.
When the roll call came around to Stanford, Director of Athletics A 1
Masters was able to /«ay that not only are the Buck Club's books open
now, but that they were open as long as three years ago.
Moreover, the fact that all Buck Club money is spent for tuition only
and that it is administered through the University itself gives Stanford
about as clean a bill of health in the booster club department as possible
during these days of professionalish athletics.
The second bit concerns the conference reversing its field like a scared
scatback as regards the principle of out-of-season practice. Six months
ago the PCC ruled against spring basketball practice. A week ago the
same PCC ruled in favor of it, but attempted to continue the principle
of "de-ernphasis" by limiting the number of practice sessions to 20.
Bosh!!! Spring practice is spring practice. And it doe-n't fit in with
the idea of playing college sports for the fun of it. When, in order to stay
in competition, a coach is forced to develop such a highly polished team
that he requires year-around participation, it takes the fun out of play
ing. What about the basketballer who wants to run track, swim, or just
t.ke it easy during the off season?
What we say about the casaba game goes just as well for any other
(here's where we lose a few more friends) —football, soccer, or any other
sport. Down with organized, full-scale, required or semi-required spring
practice. For inexperienced players, however it does seem reasonable
to permit and encourage elementary classes in the various sports.
