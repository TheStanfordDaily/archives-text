## Robinson-Maxim Bout Postponed 
### 
NEW YORK. June 23 â€” Day
long rain forced postponement of
tonight's Joey Maxim - Sugar Ray
Robinson fight to Wednesday night,
and the shift caused cdds-makers
to install Robinson a 13-10 favorite
to take Maxim's light-heavyweight
crown.
Many boxing men believed the
delay would lessen Maxim's chances
of keeping his 175-pound crown in
their 15-round fight at Yankee Sta
dium because he must make the
weight asain Wednesday.
Maxim scaled 174 :i -4 at today's
weigh-in: and he must eat lightly
and take a hard workout tomorrow
afternoon at the New York Ath
letic Club to prevent going above
the 175-pound limit. He weighed
184 for his last non-title bout.
Middleweight champion Robinson
scaled exactly 160 pounds during
the weigh-in ceremony. His only
weight problem was to keep rea
sonably "built up'' so that Cleve
land Joey would not have too high
an advantage.
