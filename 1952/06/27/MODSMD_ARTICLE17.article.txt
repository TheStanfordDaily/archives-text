# The 						Summer Daily
## 
### 
In the mad rush of the first week of school, the Daily neglected
o introduce itself editorially to the new members of the University.
We would therefore like to take this chance to issue a belated wel
come to all summer quarter students and visiting faculty.
The Daily is your newspaper. It costs you eighty-five cents
n quarter (taken from each tuition check) whether you like it or
lot. Frankly, we think that's a small price to pay for the services
ve hope to give you in exchange.
First of all, we will try to cover the campus as best we can.
With an undermanned staff, it means we will need your help in
patting news from your department or organization. The sooner
you can get in touch with us, the better coverage you will receive.
We encourage students and faculty to air their opinions in the
Daily by sending us letters. We reserve the right to cut lengthy
ones, so make thom short and to the point. Unsigned editorials
are written by the editor; those that are signed are written by staff
nembers.
The Daily shack is next door to the University Press office and
he Journalism department. We will publish on Tuesdays and Fri
days every week until August 22. Feel free to come in any time.
