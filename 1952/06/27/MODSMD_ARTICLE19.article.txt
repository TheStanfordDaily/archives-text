# BULL SESSION

It's summer and the living is easy. And summer quarter at Stanford is
living at its best. Where else can one combine studies, suntans, out
door activities, indoor activities, and beautiful girls and all in a gay eight
(o ten-week fling?
Why, as I sit at my desk in San Francisco and pound this session on
any stand-up Royal, I hear the dull booming of the fog horns and my

window bears evidence of the fog that sweeps this
City by the Golden Gate. A San Francisco summer
is as depressing as a full moon and empty arms.
My thoughts carry thirty plus miles to the south,
to Stanford nestled in the foothills, the sun beaming
on daytime doings, and the moon and stars casting
their approval on evening escapades. Frankly, I am
envious.
But my memories are pleasant ones. For you see
it was only a year ago, ah. the wonder of it ail, that
I was a Stanford summer student; awake earlv,

tasking all day, cavorting all night. Granted, it was a routine, but what
n routine!
Seems my life was the opposite of that couplet which blares, "Early to
"ied, early to rise, makes you healthy, wealthy, and wise.'' True, it was
<.±arly to rise, and even that wasn't consistent. But I sure played havoc
vith early to bed. I grew healthy during the day, when my eyes finally
nanaged to greet the sun, but the night destroyed any good acquired dur
ng the warm day. As for wealthy, why, I was at Stanford and it was
summer, and what's more, without even trying I could become insolvent
easily, so why fight it. And for wise, why, of course I was primarily a
(Student but it was summer, I often rationalized, and my wisdom was not
allowed to run away with itself.
Don't take me wrong, though. It isn't becau«e I dropped to a minus
2\ that I am scribbling this from my frigid northern home. Strangelv, I
un in good standing with the University authorities. And if my draft
hoard wills it, bless their little hearts, I shall return to the Farm come
the falling of the autumn leaves and attempt to carry out the position
»112 Daily sports editor, an honor recently bestowed upon me.
No, I am in this great city to the north because I needed a release from
.he strain of it all; the strain of seven straight strenuous, grueling Stan
ord quarters. The summer is not empty and bleak for me. Rather, I
,'iave undertaken a job, nothing steady upon which I would frown and
look aghast, but instead odd jobs; very odd jobs, I shall.describe at
a later writing.
So, kiddies, don't take that "early to bed, early to rise, makes you
wealthy, and wise" saying too seriously, at least not at Stanford,
it least not during daylight saving when the day is so full and the night
ho precious, Always keep in mind—it's Stanford summer session and the
living is easy.
