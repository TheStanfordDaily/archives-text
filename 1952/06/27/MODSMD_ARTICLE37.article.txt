# Mathias, Simon, Hertz Enter Trials
## 
### 
Bob Mathias leaves this morn- j
ing for Los Angeles where he
will enter the United States
Olympic Trials in three events — ;
shot put, discus, and high hur
dles—for which he qualified in
the NCAA meet two weeks ago. j
Contacted yesterday, Stanford's j
track coach Weiershauser reported
that Mathias is actually entering the
trials more for the workout than
for a spot in any of his events, but !
that he wiii definitely contend in ,
all three.
Weiershauser thought that Bob's I
best chance to place well in the '
trials would come in the 110-meter
high hurdles. However, if Mathias
makes the team in the barrier
event, he will be forced to vacate it.
The hurdles are run on the days
immediately preceding the decath
lon, and even Tulare Bob will re
l quire two days' rest before compet
ing in the grueling 10-event test.
Chance in Discus
Other obsex-vers believe that Ma
thias has a better chance to make
the charmed circle of three com
petitors who will spin the discus at
Helsinki, especially since Montana's
i Dick Doyle is now in a torso cast
after injuring his neck severely.
SC's Sim Iness and Fortune Gor
dien, competing under the banner
of the LAAC, are rated top-heavy
i favorites for the first two spots in
! the discus. But any one of Mathias,

Jim Dillon of Auburn, Perry O'Bri- j
en, or Dcs Koch could slip into the ,
third spot.
If he qualifies, Mathias will be
able to compete at Helsinki in this
event, since it comes far enough in
advance of the decathlon.
Decathlon Next
Immediately following the trials,
big Bob will leave Los Angeles for
Tulare to defend his national de
! cathlon title against a field of some
! 51 entries on July 1 and 2.
The top three men from the de
| cathlon meet will qualify for the
| Games in this event. Bill Albans,
I Floyd Smmons, and "Preacher" Bob
i Richards will give Mathias the big-
I gest battle for one of these spots, al
! though the way's clear for some
virtual unknown to come blazing
into track prominence by capturing
i the top spot just like Bob himself
[ did four years ago.
Other Stanfoi*d entries in the Los
1 Angeles Trials will include Bob Si
; mon, bucking a tough field in the
; 1,500 meters, and Howard Hertz in
equally stiff competition in the shot
put. Bob Reed, heralded frosh dis-
Stance ace, has decided to drop out of
the 5,000-meter competition.
Likewise it is improbable that
javelin throwers Bob Kimball and
Leo Long and shot" putter Chuck
Hokanson will enter the trials.
Former Cards Enter
Former Cards Gay Bryan, Bud
: Held, and Otis Chandler are prom
| inent in the pre-meet figuring for
: spots on the Olympic team.
Bryan is qualified in both the
i broad jump and the hop, step, jump;
Held in the javelin; and Chandler
; in the shot.
Jack Weiershauser himself will
be able to take in the Games this
year, thanks to a combination of
circumstances. Alumni of El Toro
. eating club began a drive some time
ago to raise funds for the trip.
When the drive was partially
| finished. A 1 Masters had to give up
leadership of the Olympic Games
travel tour he was guiding, and
! Jack was able to step into his shoes.
! The tour will make it possible for
| him to complete his trip.
i After the Los Angeles trials,
j Weiershauser will return to Stan
ford until he leaves a week from
! Sunday for Quebec and the begin
j ning of the tour.


THAR SHE GOES—Bob Mathias lets fly with one of his 165-foot
plus discus heaves. Mathias' chances of qualifying for the
Olympics in the platter spin received an unexpected boost this
week when Dick Doyle of Montana injured his neck. .

championship fight in New York Wednesday night. Robinson
lost by a TKO as, exhausted by 100 degree heat, he failed to
answer the bell for the 14th round. The first referee, Ruby
Goldstein, also was overcome by heat exhaustion, in the 10th
round. —NEA Telephoto
