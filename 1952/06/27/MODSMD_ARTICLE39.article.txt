# JIM MADISON
## A 						Sporting Chance 
### 
It's tough that the vaunted Card golfers fell apart in the NCAA tour
ney, but Stanford did come uut of the tournament week w.th one honor
election of Coach Bud Finger as secretary of the National Intercollegiate
Golf Association.
Just goes to reassure you of the continuing high esteem in which
Stanford coaches are held by their colleagues. Or do you remember that
Chuck Taylor was selected "coach of the year" in his first season as head
of the Indians? That baseball and former basketball coach Everett Dean
was named to the Attorney General's commission to investigate gambling
in sports? Or that swim mentor Tom Kaynie has been prominent in swim
ming coaches' circles ever since he started at Stanford in 1947, serving in
such positions as member of the Ail-American selection committee?
This esteem and honor reflects favorably on the prestige of the various
teams as well as on Stanford University itself. Xind of nice chaps to have
around, aren't the coaches?

Olympic Rowers
The chancer of Stanford's eight- j
oared crew winning the Olympic
trials in Massachusetts are less than
thoie of a maiden in the Kentucky
Derby, but two other Card rowers j
have a better than fighting chiuice
to make the boat trip and bring !
home a gold medal. Names —Dewey
Heeht and Jim Fifer, who with Jim i
Beggs are trying to represent the !
U.S.A. in doubles with coxswain.
They've been mentioned before ;
on these page;--, but their perform- i
ances have bean kept a mystery j
thus far. In training tince the first
of the year with the shell housed at j
Redwood City, the Cards, both
three-year veterans en the eight j
(Filer was captain fast year as a I
junior), have run some outstanding '
time trials. As a matter of fact, |
none of the trials held were at times j
as slow as that which won the 184S I
Olympics,
Old Favorite
George Trautman was well on [
base early this week when he didn't ]
allow one fairly pretty Eleanor En- j
gle to piay ball with a Class B East- j
ern club. He said that baseball is a i
man's game despite how good the I
gal might or mightn't have been. |
And that follows a principle laid
down in one of my all-time favor
ite sports columns, written by Stan
ford's Dick Hyland.
It seems that Glendale's Hoover
High School had a girl tennis star
who could lick any of the boys on
the school varsity. The high school
sfports editor suggested she be per- j
mitted to play on the varsity and i
wrote a letter to Hyland seeking his \
support.
What he replied (and it's damn
good advice to the lassies) was
something to the effect that there j
are times when the only rationali
zation for women not playing some )
sports in competition with men is
the question of vanity. The gals !
may be good, but it's better for the \
sake of society, mating, etc., that
they lay or? and let the man think
it's his segment of the world, that i
only he can perform competently
in it, and that it's too much for any i
mere woman. That is, play hard,
but stay women, women.

It seems that Glendale's Hoover
High School had a girl tennis star
who could lick any of the boys on
the school varsity. The high school
sfports editor suggested she be per- j
mitted to play on the varsity and i
wrote a letter to Hyland seeking his \
support.
What he replied (and it's damn
good advice to the lassies) was
something to the effect that there j
are times when the only rationali
zation for women not playing some )
sports in competition with men is
the question of vanity. The gals !
may be good, but it's better for the \
sake of society, mating, etc., that
they lay or? and let the man think
it's his segment of the world, that i
only he can perform competently
in it, and that it's too much for any i
mere woman. That is, play hard,
but stay women, women.
It's tough that the vaunted Card golfers fell apart in the NCAA tour
ney, but Stanford did come uut of the tournament week w.th one honor
election of Coach Bud Finger as secretary of the National Intercollegiate
Golf Association.
Just goes to reassure you of the continuing high esteem in which
Stanford coaches are held by their colleagues. Or do you remember that
Chuck Taylor was selected "coach of the year" in his first season as head
of the Indians? That baseball and former basketball coach Everett Dean
was named to the Attorney General's commission to investigate gambling
in sports? Or that swim mentor Tom Kaynie has been prominent in swim
ming coaches' circles ever since he started at Stanford in 1947, serving in
such positions as member of the Ail-American selection committee?
This esteem and honor reflects favorably on the prestige of the various
teams as well as on Stanford University itself. Xind of nice chaps to have
around, aren't the coaches?

Olympic Rowers
The chancer of Stanford's eight- j
oared crew winning the Olympic
trials in Massachusetts are less than
thoie of a maiden in the Kentucky
Derby, but two other Card rowers j
have a better than fighting chiuice
to make the boat trip and bring !
home a gold medal. Names —Dewey
Heeht and Jim Fifer, who with Jim i
Beggs are trying to represent the !
U.S.A. in doubles with coxswain.
They've been mentioned before ;
on these page;--, but their perform- i
ances have bean kept a mystery j
thus far. In training tince the first
of the year with the shell housed at j
Redwood City, the Cards, both
three-year veterans en the eight j
(Filer was captain fast year as a I
junior), have run some outstanding '
time trials. As a matter of fact, |
none of the trials held were at times j
as slow as that which won the 184S I
Olympics,
