### MIKE HUDSON 
Stanford's qolfers folded in
the qualifying xound cf the
NCAA tourney now going on |
ovsr Purdue's short, steaming,
wind-swept course.
The thermometer soared into the
nineties and Stanford's scores into
the high seventies and eighties as
the Cards wilted to a team total of
tiCS strokes, 21 strokes behind North
Texas State, who won fheir fourth
consecutive team crown.
The one Card who cam 2 ]
i

112 through despite wind, weather,
and pressure was the placid soph
! slugger. Grant Spaeth. Spaeth
tied for sixth place among the 192
' entrants with a steady 74-72—146.
Fred Brown, Stanford's freshman
! wonder, staggered in with a medi
ocre 77-70—153. Brown had not
shot over 73 in any round of com
petition this year.
'1 iie long-hitting, erratic War
ren Dai ley was oft' his ,»ame and
just barely qualified with a 76-78
—154.
Next in line came Air Force vet
| eran Dick Taylor. Taylor had qual
ified as a starter with a spectacular
?85 for 72 holes over the rough
j Stanford course. He collapsed to a
77-78—155 on the easier Purdue
I course.
Keith Beekman fire J a good 74
on Monday, but on Tuesday his
score ballooned to 84 for a 158
total.
Last and least came captain Dick
McElyea who closed cut an illus-
I trious four-year career as a Card
| swinger with a dismal SO-Sl—l6l.
The sharp-shooting McElyea was
j regarded as a cinch to murder the
| short Purdue layout, which re

quires accuracy, not distance, to
conquer.
The Cards had been second fa
vorites to North Texas State in
, the tournament, hut they finished
: seven strokes out of the top five-
North Texas State's sccve was the
j same as Stanford's winning total
| in last month's Pacific Coast tour
