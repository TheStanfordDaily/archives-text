### 
♦ WASHINGTON, June 30 (UP)—
j President Truman signed the eco
j nomic controls law without com
ment today but was expected ti
1 issue a scathing denunciation of the
! new law tomorrow.
All signs indicated the President's
statement will be a bitter criticism
! of the law which government price
officials said will lorce the removal
of price ceilings from all processed
fruits and vegetables.
House Speaker Sam Rayburn sail
the President was far from pleased
I with the bill. Aside from its impact
I on fruits and vegetables, price offi
cials said the statute probably will
mean higher prices on hotel an 1
restaurant meals. Milk and cigaiet
1 prices also are expected to rise i:i
i states where present ceilings are
j below state minimum prices.
Price officials said fruits and veg
; etables represent about 20 per cent
I of the average family's food budget.
Regarding Mr. Truman's expected
blast, the White House merely sa : .J
he will issue a statement tomorrow
on the bill which continues wage
price controls for 10 months but
ends federal rent ceilings on Sept.
30 except under special circum
stances.
Officials predicted that the Presi
dent would denounce what he con -
siders "defects'' in the law and
sharply attack the Republican-
Southern Democratic coalition in
the House which at one point came
j within an inch of killing all con
trols.
