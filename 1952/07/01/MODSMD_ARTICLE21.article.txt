# 'Students Are Expected...'
## 
### 
Personal honor and integrity play a large part in the lives of Stanford
j.nen and women, and these are the ideals on which the University was
founded. Dr. David Starr Jordan, the first president of Stanford, phrased
the essential spirit of the University in the Fundamental Standard:
''Students are expected to show both within and without the Uni
versity such respect order, morality, and the rights of others as is
! demanded of good citizens. Failure to do this will he sufficient cause
For removal from this University."
Although this statement may seem intangible, it is a principle by which
every true Stanford student abides. By demand of the student body this
; irinc iple has been specifically adapted to academic life in the form of the
Honor Code. As set down in the constitution of the Associated Students,
the -~Tonor Code is an undertaking of the students individually and col
,'erlively pledging:
*1. That they will not ifive or receive aid in examinations; that they
will not give or receive unpermitted aid in class work, in the prepara
tion of reports, or in any other work that may he used l>v the instructor
as tne basis of grading.
2. That they will do their share and take an active part in seeing to
it ihat others as well as themselves obey the spirit and the letter of the
J *onor Code."
v e of Stanford are extremely proud of the Fundamental Standard and
•he lfonor Code. The keynote for the success of both of these is the re
sponsibility of the members of the Stanford Family. It is our purpose to
introduce this responsibility to the new members of our family. The
j io),or Code depends upon us, individually and collectively, for its
strength; and it will function only with the* deep understanding, whole
hearted interest, and active participation of us all. Accepting it. you have
;i lined the Stanford Family.
