DR. KURT F. REINHARDT. Stan
ford professor of Germanic and
Romanic languages, is the author
of "The Existentialist Revolt," a
hook just published and now on
sale at the Bookstore. Dr. Rein
hardt examines the philosophies
of Heidegger, Sartre, Kierke
gaarde. and the Christian, as well
as others, and finds that existen
tialism "eminently fits an age in
which man's retreat from God
and his consequent spiritual aban
donment have rendered question
able the very meaning of human
existence." This summer Dr.
Reinhardt is teaching a course
here entitled "Existentialism in
Modern European Literature."
