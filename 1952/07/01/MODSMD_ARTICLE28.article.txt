# TULARE HOSTS ITS CHAMP
## Mathias Against Field In Decathlon Grind Today 
### 
Bob Mathias will take the first concrete step today in his attempt
to "knock 'em dead" (so says the Chronicle's Bob Goethals) in the
Olympic Games decathlon, when he begins competition in the
combined national decathlon championship ; and Games trials in
Tulare.
In his first competitive ten-eventer in two years, "Mr. Decathlon"

will be up against such fine athletes
as Floyd Simmons, Bill Albans, and
Bill Miller in a race far the three
trips to Helsinki guaranteed the
three top finishers.
In a surprise announcement yes
terday Bob Richards the pole
vaulting parson who had been ex
pected to press Mathias the closest,
withdrew from competition in the
decathlon.
Richards suffered a leg injury in
winning the vault event at the
Olympic Trials in Los Angeles and
withdrew to concentrate on winning
the Olympic pole vault rather than
risk further injury in the decathlon.
Some 47 other entrants, includ
ing Bob's younger brother Jinr and
a Plainfield, N.J.. high school senior
named Milton Campbell, who is
rated the "new Mathias," will be
out to make things tough for the
headliners and maybe squeeze in
among the Olympic qualifiers.
Stanford Coach Jack Weiershau
ser and other track observers feel
that Mathias' main competition in
the two-day event will be the point
system, considerably scaled down
from that in use when Mathias set
the existing world record at 8,042
in 1950.
