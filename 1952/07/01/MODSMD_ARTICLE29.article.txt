# Held Makes Games Team
## 
### 
Outside of Bob Mathias in the
decathlon, Franklin Bud Held will
be the lone Stanford representative
competing for the United States in
an Olympic Games track and field
event.
Held, leading U.S. javelin thrower
when he wore the Cardinal colors
a couple of seasons back, barely
managed to qualify for the Games
team last Friday when his
throw of 224 feet 2 X :> inches gave
him the third spot.
Other Stanford entries in Los An
geles' track trials fared even more
poorly. Bob Mathias didn't make
the finals in the high hurdles, took
ninth in the discus at 161 feet 4%
inches, and was last in the shot put.
Howard Hertz had one of his
worst days of the year to finish
ninth in the shot with a put of 51
feet l J/ 4 inches.
Bob Simon dropped out of the
1,500 meters shortly before the fin
ish; Bob Reed, hampered by sore
feet, dropped out of the 1,000 meters
after only two laps.
Gay Bryan, Merritt Van Sant. and
Otis Chandler — all ex-Cards — all
failed to come anywhere near mak
ing the boat to Helsinki in their
respective events.
