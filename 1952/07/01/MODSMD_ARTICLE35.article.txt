"THE SQUAD TRUCK" —Approximately $17,000 worth of new
fire truck is shown above in the doorway of the campus fire
house. It is a pump truck (600 gallons per minute, with a 500-
gallon tank for non-hydrant areas) and is motored by a 184-
horsepower engine. Fire Chief Marston, while proud of the
truck, hopes it will be used as little as possible, reminding stu
dents that a carelessly disposed-of cigarette can cause a confla
gration. —Daily photo by Vernon Dunn
