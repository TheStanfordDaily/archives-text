# Microwave Lab Annex Announced
## Elaborate Planning Designed for New Lab 
### 
Construction of a $244,000 exten
sion of Stanford* Microwave Labo
ratory will begin in a few days.
Building plans were announced
yesterday by President Wallace
Sterling, following their approval
by the University trustees.
The extension will house the "end
station" of the billion-volt linear
electron accelerator, according to
Professor Edward L. Ginzton, di
rector of the laboratory. He added
that the accelerator should be com
plete before the end of the year.
Elaborate planning by a team of
physicists, engineers, and archi
tects was called for in designing the
end station extension. It must
accommodate radiation shielding,
electromagnets that will deflect and
focus the electron beam, and a va
riety of other physics equipment.
A network of trenches built into
the floor will carry the maze of wir
ing and cables to instruments. A
separate, small concrete building
will house the generators to power
the electromagnets.
Outside the end station exten>ion,
i huge earth embankment will be
raised. Stanford scientists will
shoot the beam into this earth bank
for disposal after using it in their
experiments.
