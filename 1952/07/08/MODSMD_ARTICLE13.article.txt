# Family Social Program
## 
### 
Juring the regular academic year only about one-third of Stan
ford's registration is comprised of graduate students, but during
*he summer quarter this proportion climbs until this summer it has
:.*edciied a total of slightly more than three-fourths of the student
jbociy. Out of 2,106 matriculated students registered, 1,532 are in
fhe Graduate Division.
~)f ihese graduate students, almost half are teachers studying in
fhfe School of Education. Many of these teachers, as well as other
graduate students, are married and are spending the summer at
.Stcuiiord with their families.
Many of these families have come into an entirely new social en
rironment at Stanford. They left their friends and acquaintances at
ho. tie. They are unacquainted with the social facilities this area
has to offer. Time not devoted to studying can weigh heavily on
"heir hands.
'n several complaints that have reached us the situation has
:'ea ned the point where these graduate students attend Stanford
: ic t because of its attractive environment, but because they have
A o in order to gain required degrees for pay advancement.
""he question arises whether a social program planned by Excom
;onmrti'ily to suit the interests of undergraduate students will fill the
ne«ds of this group of married students, the largest single social
group at Stanford this summer.
~}ut of seven voting members of Excom, only one represents the
graduate students, rather below the proportion of grad students to
• v ot<i i student body.
'Moreover, this single member (not married) was selected from
only three candidates who tried out for the position, indicating that
oeihaps the married students are not interested or don't have the
time to work through a group such as Excom to develop a social
program.
during the regular year there is a graduate council which func
"ions rather ineffectually as a governing body for Stanford's grad
laie students. However, this group seems to have shut up shop
: x or rhe summer.
'.""he lack of other resources seems to leave it up to either the Uni
versity or the school (Education; perhaps through the Ed Council)
:In which the bulk of the married students study to develop in some
nanner a program of social activities.
Which body should undertake this task; whether the program
should consist of get-togethers, outings, or merely means by which
rhe students may become acquainted with the public social facili
ies j i this area, we do not propose to answer.
■fowever, we do say that some such program is imperative if
■Stanford is to build an attractive study environment which will
continue to attract estimable graduate students.—Jim Madison
