## Mathias, Rowers, Geary Make Team 
### 
A week has gone by since The Daily last appeared, and in that
time five more present and former Stanford athletes have added
themselves to Bud Held on Uncle Sam's huge Olympic Games
team.
Heading the list, of course, is the incomparable Bob Mathias,

who in the National Decathlon
Championship -and Olympic quali
fying meet last Tuesday and Wed
nesday smashed any previous ten-

—Greatest decathlon performance
event performance in the world
with a total of 7,825 points under
the new, stringent point - scoring
system.
Mathias had a "hot" first night
hi the decathlon, bettering his
previous attempts in every event

ant! running up a total of 4,:]1)-l
points.
On the jjjgeond evening, Wednes
day he cooled off somewhat, but
still finished almost 800 points
ahead of-Milton Campbell, the giant
New Jersey high school junior who
maintained the tradition of at least
one high sdfool performer on every
U.S. Olympic team.
For drama, however, (lie efforts
of Card cqwers Jim Fifer, Down
Heeht, and coxswain Jim Beg,»s
take top' 'spot. Fulfilling a pro
diction made little more than a
week agi>.„in a Daily sports col
umn, the Trio edged Navy in a
photo - finish to qualify for the
Olympics in "pairs with cox."
Unheralded hy national sports
writers unfil they easily whipped
the Annap&Hs representatives in a
preliminary, heat. Bcggs et al. be
came the first Stanford crewmen
ever to make the Olympic team.
The rowers, financed down to
the pointful' buying the boat by
Beggs, weje clearly in front of
Navy until "50 yards from the fin
ish of the-Hnal race, when Hecht
"caught a '/?rab" and brought the
shell to a.-dead stop.
The salls*rs, who qualified two
other boatfffes and John Kelly in
individual \lggulls, almost made up
the margin; but the Cards got mov
ing again and the camera gave them
the win.
The victory produced reams of
publicity for the privately under
taken, so - called "orphan" crew
program at Stanford! and fulfilled
a long-standing dream for the
qualifiers, especially Beggs.
The Indian eight - oared shell
fared about as expected in the
Olympic Trials, finishing fourth be
hind Cornell, Cal, and Yale in a
first-round heat.
However^-the Card oarsmen did
manage to spread the fame of Stan
ford's renowned Warren G. Wonka
by posing him eating chow in a
wire picture which the Chronicle,
among others, ran last Thursday.
Sharon Geary rounded out
Stanford's septet of Games team
members by qualifying for the
400-metcr freestyle relay team in
the women's swim trials which
closed Sunday in Indianapolis.
Stanford's male swimming and
diving aspirants all came through
with great performances, but failed
to make what is probably the
strongest Olympic swim team ever
to represent the United States.
Bill Glathe was sixth in the
three - meter and seventh in the
platform diving trials.

A week has gone by since The Daily last appeared, and in that
time five more present and former Stanford athletes have added
themselves to Bud Held on Uncle Sam's huge Olympic Games
team.
Heading the list, of course, is the incomparable Bob Mathias,

who in the National Decathlon
Championship -and Olympic quali
fying meet last Tuesday and Wed
nesday smashed any previous ten-

—Greatest decathlon performance
event performance in the world
with a total of 7,825 points under
the new, stringent point - scoring
system.
Mathias had a "hot" first night
hi the decathlon, bettering his
previous attempts in every event

ant! running up a total of 4,:]1)-l
points.
On the jjjgeond evening, Wednes
day he cooled off somewhat, but
still finished almost 800 points
ahead of-Milton Campbell, the giant
New Jersey high school junior who
maintained the tradition of at least
one high sdfool performer on every
U.S. Olympic team.
For drama, however, (lie efforts
of Card cqwers Jim Fifer, Down
Heeht, and coxswain Jim Beg,»s
take top' 'spot. Fulfilling a pro
diction made little more than a
week agi>.„in a Daily sports col
umn, the Trio edged Navy in a
photo - finish to qualify for the
Olympics in "pairs with cox."
Unheralded hy national sports
writers unfil they easily whipped
the Annap&Hs representatives in a
preliminary, heat. Bcggs et al. be
came the first Stanford crewmen
ever to make the Olympic team.
The rowers, financed down to
the pointful' buying the boat by
Beggs, weje clearly in front of
Navy until "50 yards from the fin
ish of the-Hnal race, when Hecht
"caught a '/?rab" and brought the
shell to a.-dead stop.
The salls*rs, who qualified two
other boatfffes and John Kelly in
individual \lggulls, almost made up
the margin; but the Cards got mov
ing again and the camera gave them
the win.
The victory produced reams of
publicity for the privately under
taken, so - called "orphan" crew
program at Stanford! and fulfilled
a long-standing dream for the
qualifiers, especially Beggs.
The Indian eight - oared shell
fared about as expected in the
Olympic Trials, finishing fourth be
hind Cornell, Cal, and Yale in a
first-round heat.
However^-the Card oarsmen did
manage to spread the fame of Stan
ford's renowned Warren G. Wonka
by posing him eating chow in a
wire picture which the Chronicle,
among others, ran last Thursday.
Sharon Geary rounded out
Stanford's septet of Games team
members by qualifying for the
400-metcr freestyle relay team in
the women's swim trials which
closed Sunday in Indianapolis.
Stanford's male swimming and
diving aspirants all came through
with great performances, but failed
to make what is probably the
strongest Olympic swim team ever
to represent the United States.
Bill Glathe was sixth in the
three - meter and seventh in the
platform diving trials.
