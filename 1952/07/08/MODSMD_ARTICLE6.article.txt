CONVENTION HALL, CHICA
GO, July 7 (UP)—Gen. Douglas
Mac Arthur tonight summoned
the Republican party to a cru
sade that would throw the
"schemers and planners" of the
Truman administration out of
power in November and lead the
way to "peace, security, and
prosperity."
In a stirring keynote address to
the Republican national convention,
the five-star general castigated the
administration for its ''tragic bluri
: ders" in foreign ' and domestic af
-1 fairs. He accused the Democrats of.
j being a "war party" and of "be-
J traying the youth of America."
Mac Arthur, who was removed as
Far Eastern commander by Presi
dent Truman 15 months ago, di
rected his entire attack at the lead
ership of his former commander-in—
j chief . He never once mentioned the
angry fight between Gen. Dwight D.
Eisenhower and Sen. Robert A. Taft
for the GOP Presidential nomina
tion.
"While I have not been consulted
; with reference to Korea since my
retirement from active assignment
! 15 months ago," he said, "I can un
hesitatingly say that a leadership
which by weakness and indecision
has brought about such a military
J dilemma lacks the soundness of vis
ion, the moral courage, and the res
olute will to l'esolve it."
He also was skeptical of the ad
ministration's policy of "collective
j security" and said it is "obsessed by
the idea that we can spend our
selves into a position of leadership
j abroad, just as it believes we can
! spend ourselves into prosperity at
home."
Mac Arthur reached back into the
early days of the administration of;
the late President Roosevelt to in
dict the Democrats. He referred to
Mr. Roosevelt's efforts to "pack" the
j Supreme Court and said it was
: similar to Mr. Truman's claim of
| "inherent" powers in the steel seiz
i ure.

CONVENTION HALL, CHICA
GO, July 7 (UP)—Gen. Douglas
Mac Arthur tonight summoned
the Republican party to a cru
sade that would throw the
"schemers and planners" of the
Truman administration out of
power in November and lead the
way to "peace, security, and
prosperity."
In a stirring keynote address to
the Republican national convention,
the five-star general castigated the
administration for its ''tragic bluri
: ders" in foreign ' and domestic af
-1 fairs. He accused the Democrats of.
j being a "war party" and of "be-
J traying the youth of America."
Mac Arthur, who was removed as
Far Eastern commander by Presi
dent Truman 15 months ago, di
rected his entire attack at the lead
ership of his former commander-in—
j chief . He never once mentioned the
angry fight between Gen. Dwight D.
Eisenhower and Sen. Robert A. Taft
for the GOP Presidential nomina
tion.
"While I have not been consulted
; with reference to Korea since my
retirement from active assignment
! 15 months ago," he said, "I can un
hesitatingly say that a leadership
which by weakness and indecision
has brought about such a military
J dilemma lacks the soundness of vis
ion, the moral courage, and the res
olute will to l'esolve it."
He also was skeptical of the ad
ministration's policy of "collective
j security" and said it is "obsessed by
the idea that we can spend our
selves into a position of leadership
j abroad, just as it believes we can
! spend ourselves into prosperity at
home."
