# Stanford Players Receive Applause For Presentation of 'George Apley'
## 
### BERT BERNS 
The Stanford Players, under
the direction of F. Cowles Strick- j
land, opened their summer sea
son last Wednesday evening
with one of their best efforts in
seme time. Using a proven show,,
"The Late George Aplay," with
its original star, Leo G. Carroll,
the Players kept their first-night
audience in continual merri
ment.
The play can best be described as j
a subtle comedy oi manners. It \
shows the pleasure that Beacon
Street receives from Emerson, bird |
societies, and charitable institutions,
and its hearty displeasure over any
thing new or different such ciga
rettes, Freud, or Yale men.
Carrying the burden of the play
is Leo G. Carroll in the title role— j
a character which he, himself, origi- J
luted 011 Broadway. Carroll, as
expected, plays the part of George
Apley in what can only be termed
a magnificent performance. Ic is to |
his credit that he does not turn j
Apley into a mere caricature.
Lending their support is an out- I

standing cast composed of Stanford
students. Playing opposite Carroll,
as his wife. Is Elizabeth Janss, who
plays her role with consistency and
precision. Lawrence Strawbridge

Tickets for ''The Late George
Apley" are available at the Me
morial Hall box office ftv ail
performances, slated Wednesday
through Saturday for the next
three weeks.

and Jenny Johnson both do a com
petent job as Apley's son and
daughter respectively.
It is, however, the character parts
that supply the show with most of

its laughs. Dorothy Smith stole j
more than one scene as the spicy- |
tongued Amelia. Arthur Fisher, as j
her husband, acted his p?.rt with j
just enough sarcasm to give it
needed life.
Playing the prim and proper Ho
ratio, Kenneth Waters provides
many laughs as the "little man"
who is trying to gain a top rung on ;
the ladder of Beacon Street society.
Surprisingly enough, even small- ,
er roles ware carried very well as :
exemplified by the performances of j
Pat Currier, William Furnell, and
Evelyn McCurdy.
If you are interested in seeing sa
tirical comedy blended with the at
mosphere of Old Boston in the year j
1912, then don't miss "The Late ■
George Apley."

shows the pleasure that Beacon
Street receives from Emerson, bird |
societies, and charitable institutions,
and its hearty displeasure over any
thing new or different such ciga
rettes, Freud, or Yale men.
Carrying the burden of the play
is Leo G. Carroll in the title role— j
a character which he, himself, origi- J
luted 011 Broadway. Carroll, as
expected, plays the part of George
Apley in what can only be termed
a magnificent performance. Ic is to |
his credit that he does not turn j
Apley into a mere caricature.
Lending their support is an out- I

standing cast composed of Stanford
students. Playing opposite Carroll,
as his wife. Is Elizabeth Janss, who
plays her role with consistency and
precision. Lawrence Strawbridge

Tickets for ''The Late George
Apley" are available at the Me
morial Hall box office ftv ail
performances, slated Wednesday
through Saturday for the next
three weeks.

and Jenny Johnson both do a com
petent job as Apley's son and
daughter respectively.
It is, however, the character parts
that supply the show with most of

its laughs. Dorothy Smith stole j
more than one scene as the spicy- |
tongued Amelia. Arthur Fisher, as j
her husband, acted his p?.rt with j
just enough sarcasm to give it
needed life.
Playing the prim and proper Ho
ratio, Kenneth Waters provides
many laughs as the "little man"
who is trying to gain a top rung on ;
the ladder of Beacon Street society.
Surprisingly enough, even small- ,
er roles ware carried very well as :
exemplified by the performances of j
Pat Currier, William Furnell, and
Evelyn McCurdy.
If you are interested in seeing sa
tirical comedy blended with the at
mosphere of Old Boston in the year j
1912, then don't miss "The Late ■
George Apley."
