# The
						Summer Social Program

1 (Editor's Note.—The following letter, in reference to last Tuesday's
Daily editorial, explains how Excom is attempting to develop a more
adequate summer quarter social program, as well as outlining the exist
ing functions and the problems which confront that body's attempts
.o plan a social program.)
To the Editor:
[n a recent editorial in The Daily, the issue of the failures of the present
,-\SSU social planners to provide an adequate social medium for graduate
.students—particularly those married—was raised.
Raising these issues is timely and much needed. However, for a reasonable
solution of the problems to be achieved, it is absolutely necessary to take
note of the problem in the light of past experience and present steps which
ire being taken to meet it. I have undertaken a full investigation of the
problem in this light, and herein present my findings.
First, the feelings of the married student. Responsible sources in the
School of Education, the largest single body of married students this quar
ter, report what they consider to be a solid consensus of that group as fol
ows: The heterogeneous makeup of the married faction renders an over
vhelming preference to spend spare time traveling throughout the state,
returning to their homes for the weekends, or forming small get-togethers.
This is not a course of relaxation which has been forced upon them by the
. ack of school-sponsored activities; rather, it is their preference.
it must be remembered that the great majority of these people have
formed social habits on an entirely different plane as compared to the
younger college crowd, and trying to force either group to partake in
t he other's hahits defeats the very spirit of those "off-hours."
Many efforts have been nude during past summers to integrate the various
groups into a common medium. This summer's Student-Faculty Reception,
hough well planned and pronounced a success (for the first time in history)
caculty-wise, produced a very disappointing student turn-out, including
hose married. The ex-officio representation of Ed Council on Excom in
ecent summers has provided valuable interchange of opinion, but little else
n the way of common social plans.
But this situation should not be viewed as lamentable. To discover
die reasons, we need only re-consider the interests of these students.
This also explains the failure of these people to try out for graduate
ncmber of Excom, of which three members are graduates, but none
married. Many of the married grads undoubtedly had their fill of extra
curricular activities during their own undergrad days, and it is certainly
no one's desire to force them away from the pursuits they most enjoy.
Next, the existing calendar of the Social Committee of Excom must be
considered. Since the money with which to finance its functions comes from
die student body as a whole, functions must be planned with an eye to what
ype of activity will best please the greatest number.
On the schedule we have watermelon feeds, a barn dance and a senr
tormal dance, marshraallow roasts, and so forth. The women's pool is
open to all on weekends, including families; there are political talks
scheduled: the Stanford Players are active; and the Sunday Evening
Vlovies are providing their perennial entertainment. To all of these,
married grads are more than welcome, and their presence would help
rather than hinder the success of the event.
Though this type of affair may appeal more to the undergrad, it must be
:ecognized that they are the only practicable types of occasions which have
been suggested which grad and undergrad alike can enjoy. Liquid-busts
iit Rossotti's are not on the expenditure list, nor are events to the other
■extreme.
Proposals for appropriations to private interest groups have been dis
cussed during past summers, and discarded for the obvious reason that
the money comes from the student body as a whole, and making certain
■dlowancc.s would open the door to demands which would far surpass
ihe bounds of the summer budget.
The foregoing discussion is not aimed at suppressing new ideas in favor
ol the status quo. Loopholes in the program are easy to spot. But the method
vhich should logically be followed to bring about a better situation is not
hat; of scattered demands upon The Daily staff: rather, before exercising the
Tight to bring ideas before the students, it is only right that interested par
ies contact the social planners themselves so as to form a workable solu
tion with all the factors in mind. Unfortunately, these people have failed,
perhaps through lack of information, to present their ideas and suggestions.
have office hours from 3 to 4 p.m. each day of the week, and am yet to
be honored by the sight of a visitor. No one has sought out the vice-nresi
lent, who is social chairman, during her office hours. We need your ideas.
A recent suggestion from Ed Council, that the Excom turn their at
ention from married students to unmarried, is being acted upon now,
though care is being taken to make the married students aware that they
ire not only welcome, but to attend the planned social out
ings. To best formulate the social program, the ideas of our representa
tives must be combined with those produced by the initiative of the
interested parties. It is their duty to others in their category and to
themselves to act. The Summer Excom is at present working out a reso
lution for a different scheme of representation on Excom during the
summers to follow, to be presented for adoption by the regular Excom
