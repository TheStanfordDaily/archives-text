# Stanford Professor Believes War With Russia Inevitable
## 
### 
Under present circumstances, Dr.
Anthony E. Sokol believes war with
Russia is inevitable. Dr. Sokol, pro
lessor of Asiatic and Slavic studies
at Stanford and a research asso
ciate at the Hoover Institute, made
this statement before the Tuesday
Evening Series audience this week.
He stated that he did not believe
Russia wanted war any more than
we did; however, if the world situ
ation remains as it is, sooner or la
ter a spark will set it off.
• In comparing the possibilities of
who would win such a war, Dr.
Sokol said that Russia would win a
short war, but the strength of the
United States would be far supe
rior in a prolonged conflict.
America must strengthen its de
fense bases around the perimeter of
the Soviet Union, and must not un
derestimate its opponents in pre
paring for a future war, he said.
Russia has three major military
advantages over America in case
of a future war, he went on. First,
Russia occupies a strategical geo
graphic position in the center ot
Eurasia: second, Russia's size en
ables her to trade space for time;
and third, Russia possesses almost
all of the raw materials needed to
wa;;e a full-scale war.
Dr. Sokol observed that politi
cally, Puss, a has a bureaucracy
with the inherent instabil.tv cf dic
tatorship, especially in the face of

set-backs in policy and arrogance
toward the absolute leader.
In concluding, Dr. Sokol pointed
out some inherent weaknesses in
Russia's land, sea, and air power.
He stated that Russia's army is slow
and ill-equipped, and has never
won a battle unless it had an over
whelming majority in numbers.
As a sea power, Russia's only
force would be her submarines;
however, Dr. Sokol doubts whether
the Russians would be technically
or psychologically capable of carry
ing on underwater warfare.
Concerning the air force. Dr. So
kol explained that Russia does riot
have the long-range bomber which
the United States has, but is quite
capable of sending out suicide raid
ers. Russia's ground crews are
highly skilled in combating air at
tacks.
Dr. Sokol stated that our tradi
tional air, land, and sea forces had
to be strengthened to meet the
threat of a Russian attack.

set-backs in policy and arrogance
toward the absolute leader.
In concluding, Dr. Sokol pointed
out some inherent weaknesses in
Russia's land, sea, and air power.
He stated that Russia's army is slow
and ill-equipped, and has never
won a battle unless it had an over
whelming majority in numbers.
As a sea power, Russia's only
force would be her submarines;
however, Dr. Sokol doubts whether
the Russians would be technically
or psychologically capable of carry
ing on underwater warfare.
Concerning the air force. Dr. So
kol explained that Russia does riot
have the long-range bomber which
the United States has, but is quite
capable of sending out suicide raid
ers. Russia's ground crews are
highly skilled in combating air at
tacks.
Dr. Sokol stated that our tradi
tional air, land, and sea forces had
to be strengthened to meet the
threat of a Russian attack.
Under present circumstances, Dr.
Anthony E. Sokol believes war with
Russia is inevitable. Dr. Sokol, pro
lessor of Asiatic and Slavic studies
at Stanford and a research asso
ciate at the Hoover Institute, made
this statement before the Tuesday
Evening Series audience this week.
He stated that he did not believe
Russia wanted war any more than
we did; however, if the world situ
ation remains as it is, sooner or la
ter a spark will set it off.
• In comparing the possibilities of
who would win such a war, Dr.
Sokol said that Russia would win a
short war, but the strength of the
United States would be far supe
rior in a prolonged conflict.
America must strengthen its de
fense bases around the perimeter of
the Soviet Union, and must not un
derestimate its opponents in pre
paring for a future war, he said.
Russia has three major military
advantages over America in case
of a future war, he went on. First,
Russia occupies a strategical geo
graphic position in the center ot
Eurasia: second, Russia's size en
ables her to trade space for time;
and third, Russia possesses almost
all of the raw materials needed to
wa;;e a full-scale war.
Dr. Sokol observed that politi
cally, Puss, a has a bureaucracy
with the inherent instabil.tv cf dic
tatorship, especially in the face of

set-backs in policy and arrogance
toward the absolute leader.
