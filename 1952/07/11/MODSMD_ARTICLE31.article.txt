### 
SAN FRANCISCO, July 10 (UP)—French middleweight cham
pion Robert Villemain and Carl (Bobo) Olson of Honolulu tailed
off their training today as they neared their peak condition for their
important 10-round clash in the San Francisco Cow Palace Satur
day night.
Both men worked out lightly at Newman's Gymnasium and.

unless there is a weight problem
for Villemain. neither will do much
more than shadow box tomorrow.
The weigh-in is set for noon, Sat
urday. It is probable that Villemain
will hold about a five - pound
weight advantage.
Meanwhile promoter Jimmy Dun
dee said the advance ticket sales
indicated a hou-e of $50,000. How
ever. this would not come close to
being a sell-out in the cavernous
Cow Palace.
Anticipating a victory, Villemain
announced today that he and his
wife, Denise, would attend a French
colony dance here after the battle —
the dance celebrating Bastille Day.
The betting fraternity, which has
been packing the gymnasium for
workouts of both fighters, finally
has swung over to Olson, who
looked very good in losing a close
10-round decision to Sugar Ray
Robinson in his last showing here.
The odds now favor the Honolulu
lad at 10-8.
