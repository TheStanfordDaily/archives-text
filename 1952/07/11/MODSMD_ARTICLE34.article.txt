HELSINKI, July 10 (UP)—Coach
Brutus Hamilton today warned the
American Olympic track team
about over-eating and under-sleep
ing as he cautiously tempered his
early optimism of U.S. chance?.
"There's a lot of food available in
the Olympic village and I don't
want the boys to eat themselves out
of condition,'' Hamilton explained
after distance star Browning Ro£.s
of Villanova was taken to the hos
pital with an upset stomach.
"And the boys have been com
plaining about not being able to
sleep here in the land of the mid
night sun," Hamilton added, "h's
only semi-dark three or four hours
a night and some of them can't gel
used to sleeping in the daylight."
Three of the team members—pole
vaulter Bob Richards' javelin
thrower Bud Held, and Walker
Henry Laskau—were so bothcied
by the early rising of the sun that
they were out for workouts at 4
a.m.
