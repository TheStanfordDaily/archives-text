# Red Female Entries Told

### 
HELSINKI, July 10 (UP)—Rus
sia announced today it will send
one of its women track stars after
a record-equaling four victories in
the Olympics.
Revealing its distafT squad, the
Soviets entered Aleksandra Chu
dina in three field events—the jav
elin throw, high jump, and broad
jump — and also placed the tell
blonde chauffeur on their 400-me
ter relay squad. Dutch housewife
Fanny Blaenkers-Coen won four
gold medals in the 1948 games, the
first woman ever to do so.
The Russian stars are Nadezhda
Khnykina in the sprints, Elena Go
kieli in the hurdles, Nina Dumbacze
in the discus, Klavida Tochenova
in the shot put ,and Miss Chudina.
Miss Dumbadze and Miss Toche
nova hold world records.
Should the Russian women be
able to live up to their claimed rec
ords, they would dominate the field
events and smash all records. Eut
they would come out second-best
in the track events. This deduction
comes from a comparison of the
Olympic records and the 194S win
ning times.
