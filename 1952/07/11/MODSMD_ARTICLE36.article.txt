# JIM MADISON
## A 						Sporting Chance 
### 
With the ccnter ring of the sports circus now being installed at far-distant
Helsinki and no intercollegiate competition going on in the sunny, drowsy
summertime, armchair college columnists like us don't have a lot to talk
about. However, we have picked up a yarn here, read another there, and
generally gathered up enough stuff to attempt a piece.
Inside on the Crew Victory
Not too many people know the real inspiration for the all-out winning
effort of Stanford's entry in the Olympic Rowing Trials for pairs with cox
swain made last Saturday.
Most are aware that Dewey Hecht was stroke oar on the shell. But Hecht's
determination to win was not solely inspired by dreams of competing 011
the Olympic Team. His gal friend, Stanford's Sydney Walton, is visiting in
Europe this summer and will be in Helsinki for the Games; and that, chaps,
furnished the real incentive for Hecht's winning performance.

Bob Mathias, Stanford's number one current publicity asset (other than
H Hoover, made Time against yesterday as a result of his record-breaking
triumph in the Decathlon Trials. Bob is also featured in an article by Berke
ley's Jim Scott in the August issue of Spcrt, which includes a handsome
(gooJ for a pinup, gals) full-color pic of him.
Another all-time Stanford athletic great, Bill McCol'.. has reportedly
turned down an invitation to play in the L.A. Rams vs. College All-Stars
pro-football classic because of the press of his medical studies. The same
source understands that Bill's Chicago Bear contract allows him to report
to training a month late both this year and next, another aid to his education.
A letter which fraternity brother Joe Chez dropped us just after signing
his pro-bail contract reminded us among other matters, that Joe had gotten
ua at I) in the morning for four years at Stanford to hash at Encina. To
juige from the result, it must have been good training.
Without taking anything away from Joe, but trying to appraise the base
ball pocketbooks realistically, we doubt that his "undiclosed, but substantial"
bonus was more than half, at the most, of the $25,000 that the Paly Times
saii it reportedly was.
Coast League Hall
Speaking bf baseball, we note with joy that San Diego is continuing to
hang up around first place in the Coast League at the expense of San Fran
cisco.
Lefty O'Doul, whom Paul "wonder man" Fagan rode out of town on a
rail not so very long ago, again and again is proving his ability to win ball
games without getting any hitting from his men; for his Padres not only are
one of the two teams in the league without a .300 hitter (Oakland's t'other),
they are also next to last, out of eight, with a very unhealthy .240 team
batting average. Statistics, as of last Tuesday, courtesy Leo Moriarty.
All of which sends us back to our TV set for another round of the GOP
rodeo.

Most are aware that Dewey Hecht was stroke oar on the shell. But Hecht's
determination to win was not solely inspired by dreams of competing 011
the Olympic Team. His gal friend, Stanford's Sydney Walton, is visiting in
Europe this summer and will be in Helsinki for the Games; and that, chaps,
furnished the real incentive for Hecht's winning performance.

Another all-time Stanford athletic great, Bill McCol'.. has reportedly
turned down an invitation to play in the L.A. Rams vs. College All-Stars
pro-football classic because of the press of his medical studies. The same

Without taking anything away from Joe, but trying to appraise the base

Speaking bf baseball, we note with joy that San Diego is continuing to
hang up around first place in the Coast League at the expense of San Fran
cisco.
Lefty O'Doul, whom Paul "wonder man" Fagan rode out of town on a
rail not so very long ago, again and again is proving his ability to win ball
games without getting any hitting from his men; for his Padres not only are
one of the two teams in the league without a .300 hitter (Oakland's t'other),
they are also next to last, out of eight, with a very unhealthy .240 team
batting average. Statistics, as of last Tuesday, courtesy Leo Moriarty.
All of which sends us back to our TV set for another round of the GOP
rodeo.
With the ccnter ring of the sports circus now being installed at far-distant
Helsinki and no intercollegiate competition going on in the sunny, drowsy
summertime, armchair college columnists like us don't have a lot to talk
about. However, we have picked up a yarn here, read another there, and
generally gathered up enough stuff to attempt a piece.

Not too many people know the real inspiration for the all-out winning
