# Stanford Archaeological Crew Excavates Lost Indian Village
## 
### 
The long-lost remains of an In
dian village, rediscovered by Bar
rett &. Ililp Construction Co. while
working on an East Palo Alto sub
division, are being excavated by a
team of Stanford archaeologists un
der the direction of Dr. Bert A.
C-eiow, professor of anthropology.
Estimated to be at least 500 years
old and last noticed by an early
Spanish explorer, the site has now
created much interest by its exca
vation.
To date, a total cf 12 complete
burials and a growing collection of
artifacts have been unearthed by
the diggers, many of them student
volunteers from Stanford's Depart

| ment of Anthropology and Sociol
! ogy-
Gerow, who needs even more
volunteers to complete the digging
j before construction obscures the
J site, has ordered an all-out excava
tion search for remains which will
j be used, the diggers hope, to fill in
; gaps in what is already known of
Indian culture in the pre - white
age.
The artifacts found thus far, in
cluding mortars and pestles, hand
carved stones, beads, arrow points,
and various ceremonial items, give
evidence of a large village.
