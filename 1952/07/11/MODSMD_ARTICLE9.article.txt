"Stop-Ike" movement.
In seconding speeches for Taft,

Taft, still fighting, might throw ht'a
support to any candidate who could
stop Ike, reports which are consid
ered to mean in particular Gen
eral Douglas MacArthur.

siiouting, singing demonstrations,

civil rights plank to mean that the
Republican party favored some
form of a federal fair employment
