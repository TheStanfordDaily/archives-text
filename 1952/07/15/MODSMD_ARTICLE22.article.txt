# HELSINKI ROUNDUP
## U.S.. Russia Favorites As Basketball Prelims Begin 
### KENT HALLAWELL 
Although the official opening of the Olympic Games at Helsinki
won't take place until Saturday, competition in basketball, soccer,;
and field hockey is already under way.
The United States, defending champions, and Russia, European
champions, were both exempted from this .week's cage trials and

automatically advanced to the main"
competition.
The Americans, who have been
victorious at every Games since the
sport was introduced in 1936. are
favored to win again.
A controversy has developed over

j the basketball eliminations that
I threatens to blast the Olympics
i wide open into an East-West split.
The dispute arose last week as
j kams frpm both Nationalist and I
-Communist China showed up at
Helsinki. It is expected to be set
! tied today or tomorrow with a i
'' decision barring both teams from
play.
Another squabble, centering;
around Northern California's Delia j
; Meulenkamp, seemed likely to de
-1 velop. A Russian newspaper, Soviet !
Sport, has been commenting on the
j special proiJ&dure used in order to
I get the former Dutch swimming
I star naturalized in time for the
i Games. .
The sleeping problem in Hel
[ sinki. caused by the hot and
bright midnight sun, has affected
| several of-the American athletes, I
i particularly Bud Held, ex-Stan
ford javelin thrower.
Held, also bothered by a sore
shoulder, has had at least one sleep-
I less night,' and has been seen work
! ing out at 4 "a.m.
However, Stanford's other track
and Held representative, defend
ing decathlon champ Bob Ma
thias. reports that he has not been
affected by this problem. His j
chief worry is New Jersey high
I school star Milt Campbell, who
gave Big Bob some real competi
tion in the Nationals at Tulare.
Campbell Js. far superior to the
I prepster Mathias who won at Lon- !
don four years ago, but as yet has j
j little chance of keeping Bob from !
becoming the first two-time champ
in the ten-eventer.
OLYMPIC NOTES:' Tiny Arati
Saba, a swimmer from India, is the
youngest athlete entered in the;
Games; ageft 12. . . . World's record
shot-putter Jim Fuchs is definitely |
going to compete, although he may :
require a shot of novocain to dead- j
en the pain- in his injured putting
hand. . . . The Russians are work-
J ing on a new scoring method which
j will be aorfcunced after the Olym
j pics are finished; sounds like mak
ing up the.u'ules after the game is !
over. . . . And the Argentines claim
that the marathon is THE event of ,
i the Games, .and that the victor in
this endwtfshce test bestows upon
his country the Olympic champion
ship. . . . A representative from
| Argentina' won the marathon in
1 1948, of course. . . . Stanford's Cin

derella three-man crew got a sur
prise when they took their first
workout on the Olympic course;
their shell was stationed close to a
nudist camp!
