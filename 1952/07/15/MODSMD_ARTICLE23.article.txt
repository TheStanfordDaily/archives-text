## Bob Bryan Signs Grid Pact With S.F. '49ers 
### 
Bob Bryan, halfback on the
Stanford varsity for the past two
seasons, has signed a professional
football contract with the San
Francisco '49tvs.
Bryan, rated at 5 feet 10 inches
and 17!) pounds, was overlooked
in the pro grid draft after an un
promising season last fall.
However, Bob possesses good
speed, which '49er Coach Buck
Shaw can well use in the back
field; and for (hat reason he might
just make the team.
The '49ers begin training a
week from today in Menlo Park.
