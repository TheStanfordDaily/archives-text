# Oaks, Pads, Stars Battle for Lead
## 
### United Press 
The tight-as-a-drum Pacific Coast
League pennant chase, featuring
three teams with only 11 percent
age points separating them, resumes
tonight on the bristling West Coast
baseball front.
If one of the three leaders—Oak
land, San Diego, or Hollywood—
wins, and the other two lose, that
one will take over undisputed pos
session of first place.
As a result, the managers are
sending out their crack mound aces
in an effort to get into the front
line.
Manager Mel Ott of the Acorns
has nominated his star right-hand
er, Allen Gettel (11-6), to the mound
for his team against the Seattle
Rainiers in the north country.
San Diego, one percentage point
behind the Oaks, tangles with Hol
lywood. Manager Lefty O'Doul of
the Padres has named his newest
star. Bill Henry (1-0), to take over
on the hill. Manager Fred Haney
has selected the $100,000 bonus baby
of a year ago, Paul Pettit (9-4), to
pitch for the home club.
