# Summer Excom May Change Representation of Graduates
## 
### 
At Wednesday night's meeting, Excom passed a resolution to
resent the regular fall Executive Committee with a recommenda
on changing the representation on the Summer Executive Com
littee.
Excom voted to recommend that the Education Council repre-

ntative Be changed from an ex
ficio to a voting member. This
"tl increase the number of gradu
e representatives from one to.two
iting members, the other being a
presentative-at-large. Since two
irds of the graduates in summer
tarter are education students, Ex
m .feels that a voting Education
>uncil representative and a rep
"?ntative-at-large would give the
aduates better representation than
lder the present system.
To keep a 'small working group
d to maintain the necessary odd
tmber of voting members, the
mmittee will recommend that one
jman - at - large be appointed in
ad of the present two. The mem
rs of Excom feel this change will
t affect the total representation
the women student body.
[112 the resolution is adopted by the
*ular Executive Committee, the
ident body will be represented on
? Summer Executive Committee
: ASSU prsident and vice-presi
nt, two undergraduate men, one
dergraduate woman, one Educa
n Council graduate representa
e, and one graduate-at-large.
