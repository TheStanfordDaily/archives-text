# Farm Building New X-Ray Machine for Cancer
## 
### 
A medical version of Stanford
University's atom - smashing linear
; accelerator promises to put high
energy X-ray treatment of deep
seated cancer within reach of every
hospital in the nation.
The medical electron linear ac
celerator now being built in the
University's Microwave Laboratory
will produce an X-ray beam of ap
proximately six million volts peak
energy. Such a beam, unlike ordi
nary X-rays, will penetrate to can
cerous growth deep in the body
without injury to overlying skin
tissues. In addition the apparatus
will bo compact, flexible, and rela
tively inexpensive.
Two research grants totaling
5G.1.000 have been awarded for (lie
project by the American Cancer
Society and the National Cancer
Institute of the United States Pub
lic Health Service.
The work will be directed by Pro

: fessor Edward I- Ginzton, director of
the Microwave Laboratory, ana Dr.
Henry S. Kaplan, head of the radi
ology department at Stanford Uni
versity School ,of Medicine in San
[ Francisco.
Dr. Ginzton says it will take six to
eight months to complete design
studies, but that the medical accel
erator should be finished in a year.
Supervision of development and con
struction work will be in the hands
of a nuclear physicist, Dr. Carl Bar
ber, and two electronic engineers,
Paul A. Pearson and Arnold L. El
dredge. Mathematical computations
are being carried out by Dr. En-
Lung Chu, a research associate.
The finished accelerator will he
installed at San Francisco's Stan
ford University Hospital in an ex
tension built onto the radiology de
partment. Preliminary tests will
then be undertaken by Dr. Kaplan.
The apparatus will be used first

on laboratory animals. Within a
few months, after determination of
the correct dosage, he expects to
use it in treating cancer and simi
lar ills in human patients.
The two scientists believe that the
six - million - volt accelerator could
be manufactured commercially for
little more than the $15,000 to $18,000
cost of present 200,000-volt X-ray
machines.
Stanford's compact six - million
volt accelerator may also find un
limited uses in the industrial field.
For example, in current methods of
sterilization and pasteurization of
processed foods by heating, the bac
terial count is not wiped out but
only reduced to a tolerable level.
If a jar or can of food is placed
under tbe electron beam, 100 per
cent sterility may be achieved. The
same technique can be applied to
countless other goods, including
drugs and surgical supplies.

The medical electron linear ac
celerator now being built in the
University's Microwave Laboratory
will produce an X-ray beam of ap
proximately six million volts peak
energy. Such a beam, unlike ordi
nary X-rays, will penetrate to can
cerous growth deep in the body
without injury to overlying skin
tissues. In addition the apparatus
will bo compact, flexible, and rela
tively inexpensive.
Two research grants totaling
5G.1.000 have been awarded for (lie
project by the American Cancer
Society and the National Cancer
Institute of the United States Pub
lic Health Service.
The work will be directed by Pro

: fessor Edward I- Ginzton, director of
the Microwave Laboratory, ana Dr.
Henry S. Kaplan, head of the radi
ology department at Stanford Uni
versity School ,of Medicine in San
[ Francisco.
Dr. Ginzton says it will take six to
eight months to complete design
studies, but that the medical accel
erator should be finished in a year.
Supervision of development and con
struction work will be in the hands
of a nuclear physicist, Dr. Carl Bar
ber, and two electronic engineers,
Paul A. Pearson and Arnold L. El
dredge. Mathematical computations
are being carried out by Dr. En-
Lung Chu, a research associate.
The finished accelerator will he
installed at San Francisco's Stan
ford University Hospital in an ex
tension built onto the radiology de
partment. Preliminary tests will
then be undertaken by Dr. Kaplan.
The apparatus will be used first

on laboratory animals. Within a
few months, after determination of
the correct dosage, he expects to
use it in treating cancer and simi
lar ills in human patients.
The two scientists believe that the
six - million - volt accelerator could
be manufactured commercially for
little more than the $15,000 to $18,000
cost of present 200,000-volt X-ray
machines.
Stanford's compact six - million
volt accelerator may also find un
limited uses in the industrial field.
For example, in current methods of
sterilization and pasteurization of
processed foods by heating, the bac
terial count is not wiped out but
only reduced to a tolerable level.
If a jar or can of food is placed
under tbe electron beam, 100 per
cent sterility may be achieved. The
same technique can be applied to
countless other goods, including
drugs and surgical supplies.
