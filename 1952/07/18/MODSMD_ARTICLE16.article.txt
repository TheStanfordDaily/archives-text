### LARRY CAHN TOM GLIKBARG 
Vgain this famed research team of Cahn and Glikbarg has delved into
i problem of vital interest to all Farm students—but one which may not
iave received proper attention in the busy life of present-day youth.
'Today's lecture: the origin of the donut.
A Toah Webster in his book of many words defines donut as "a fried
rake." We were at our favorite coffee shop when the* sight of dough-like
objects with empty centers provoked some thought in our heads (likewise
;mpiy-centered). Our newly aroused interest sent us on a whirlwind
quest through the stacks of San Francisco's well-stacked main library the
erv iiext day.
From"The Rise of the Donut" by Yeasl, "The Hole Story" by Wonka,
nn "Donut Horticulture" by Sam Anonymous we gathered many facts
did legends, from near and far, which we now pass on to you, space
permitting.
the most interesting theory on the donut centers in the OzarkS.
There it is rumored that Daniel Boone once wagered a jug of moonshine
' h.'i+ be could shoot the center out of what we now know as a pancake at
530 >ards; and damned if.he didn't do it. This form of backwoods compe
tition soon replaced the turkey shoot, and in those days Ozarkians could
io+ ;,fford to throw away anything, not even pancakes with holes in them,
the donut.
r Ao fascinating myths have come to us from across the seas. During
he Dark Ages small round cakes, similar to present-day hardtack, were
.iiored in castle cellars. There were many mice. And in those days
) asile dwellers could not afford to throw away anything, even hard
' tack with holes in it.
other of these myths which has been handed down through the
centuries is a sea ditty. However it does not concern itself with life pre
,servers as you might suspect. It seems that Columbus, when faced with a
mutinous crew, kept the fact that he was boss in front of his men by
.'laving their cake served in donut form, interlocking to resemble shackles.
Another version of this legend speaks of cake served to look like rope.
•This sjems to account for the cruller.
i d whereas the washerwoman brings her clothes to a line, we must
bring our lines to a close. In doing so we prefer not to give you the
r ri 4 1 slogan which warns, "Keep your eye upon the donut and not upon
' hf hole," but rather the words of the immortal bard: "Donut never mioke
in de Mem Aud."
