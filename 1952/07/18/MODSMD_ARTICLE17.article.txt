.Jr. Roy F. Nichols, visiting pro
essor at Stanford and a Pulitzer
Pri/.e winner in American history,
traced the origins of America's po

liencf this week.
!i.Je traced the roots of the Ameri
can and British two-party system
jack to the invasions of England
oeg'iinirg with Caesar in 55 B.C.
These invasions, Dr. Nichols ex
plained split England into two rival
jamps, the natives and the invaders;
however, it also taught them to co
operate. This development of the
■'wo parties, coupled with the intro
duction of self-government by the
Nomiai'i kings, strengthened and
'established a political system which
our Jorefathers used as a pattern
Tor our present political parties.
Ir. Nfichols said that in the
American colonies during the
,;truggle of the elite Eastern sea
joarcl against the pressure of de
mocracy from the Western farmers,
the British ideal of "life, liberty,
ijmi property" was changed to Jef
ferson's "life, liberty, and the pur
suit of happiness."
1.01 urding to Dr. Nichols, the
.Ameiican Revolution's greatest po

litical contribution was the devel
opment of the federal system.
Throughout the course of American
history, political and social reforms
occurred which made politics no
longer a game.
Dr. Nichols ioresaw an increase
of more welfare functions of gov
ernment. This, he thought, brings
about numerous dangers such as
discouragement of productivity and
destruction of human incentive.
However, Dr. Nichols firmly be
lieved that the deep-rooted Anglo-
American customs would survive
the threat of Communism.
In describing our political sys
tem, Dr. Nichols first compared it
with the British system. The Brit
ish fight political battles in terms
of the parties, whereas the Ameri
cans fight such disputes in terms of
the leading personalities. He also
added that our political system is
"bewildering." It is a loose federa
tion of state parties. "Actually," he
declared, "we have 98 political par
ties instead of two."
In closing, Dr. Nichols stated that
generally, Americans are not too
harsh about corruption in govern
ment, while the British have a high
regard for public duty.
