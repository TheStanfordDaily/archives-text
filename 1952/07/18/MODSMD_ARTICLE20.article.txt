# Mathias Publicity Buildup
## 
### 
For the past several weeks Bob
Mathias, poised to defend his Olym
pic decathlon crown in Helsinki, has
been the star of one of the greatest
publicity buildups ever to be given
to an individual athlete.
Climaxed Wednesday with the
publication of a cover story in the
national newsmagazine Time, the
press coverage has ranged all the
way from articles in sports maga
zines to a pictorial story in the
Chevrolet house organ, Friends.
Time bills him as vhe answer to
tire Europeans' perennial criticism
ot American athletes: they have no
endurance. And this Big Bob most
certainly is, for the grueling decath
lon demands a more durable and

versatile athlete than any other
modern with the pos
sible exception of the pentathlon.
Time mardfees on about Bob for
almost seven-cblumns. Friends pub
lished a twd-fjfige splash of pictures
showing him-performing in each of
the decathlon's ten events.
And the ljaagazine Sport features
an article August issue by
Berkeley's Jim Scott which is about
the best 21ry#uir biography of the
champion published to date.
All of which makes little news
except to call,.io mind that Stanford
should be pr.qud of Mathias not only
for his athletic successes, but be
cause he is one of the best public

relations assets the Farm has boast
ed in a long while.
