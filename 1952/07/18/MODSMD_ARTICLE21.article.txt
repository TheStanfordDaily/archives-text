### 
Wednesday Dave Wik, Paly
Times sports columnist, referred
to a piece by Curley Grieves of
the Examiner in which Grieves
was moaning that no Manford of
ficial had as yet sern any con
gratulatory message to the Card
crew which won the Olympic
TriaLs.
Grieves was squelched yester
day when Stanford Director of
Publicity Pete Allen announced
that President Sterling had dis
patched personal letters air-mail
to Helsinki congratulating the in
dividual crew members.
