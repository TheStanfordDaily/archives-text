### 
HELSINKI, July 17 (UP)â€” Na
j tionalist China pulled out of the
J 1952 Olympic Games today after the
! International Olympic Committee,
! in a surprise move, decided both
the Red and Nationalist teams could
| compete.
The lOC thought it had solved
sports' cold war with the wisdom of
! Solomon when it voted to open its
j doors to both rival Chinese fac
j frions. As a matter of fact, Olympic
Chancellor Otto Mayer was an
-1 nouncing the "settlement of the dis
| pute in one room while Chinese
j Nationalist Gunsun Ho was angrily
j withdrawing from the games in an
other.
Some observers thought the Na
tionalists handed the Reds a propa
ganda victory, since it will be the
Communist flag which is paraded
in the Olympic march during Sat
, urday's opening ceremony.
Gunsun hastily added, however,
, that Nationalist China will remain
within the Olympic organization
| even though it is withdrawing from
the 1952 Games.
The bitter political dispute over-

shadowed the pre-Olympic basket
ball competition as Canada, the
Philippines, and Bulgaria qualified
for the championship tournament.
Canada beat Egypt, 63-57, and Bul
garia downed Cuba, 62-56. The
Philippines downed Hungary, 48-35,
and Italy eliminated Romania, 53-
|39.
