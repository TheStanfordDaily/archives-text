## 
### 
The deadline for requests for
changes in examinations for either
eight- or ten-week courses will be
Monday rather than Aug. 11 as an
nounced in the Time Schedule. The
change is being made because of the
great increase in the number of
eight-week courses.
Students should file requests on
special forms obtuined from the
Registrar's Office. Faculty requests
should be sent to Mrs. Hurd, 111-R,
for consideration by the Committee
on Schedule and Examinations.
