MAGNESIUM FlRE—Firemen battle to control fires started when a furnace treating a ton of white
hot magnesium exploded at the Sequoia Metal Crafts plant in San Carlos Saturday. The glow of
the burning magnesium was so bright it blinded workers who approached the scene. The heat
was so great that water from the fire hoses turned to steam before reaching the flames. The first
explosion was followed by several hours of smaller blasts as magnesium castings blew up rocket
ing 30 feet into the air, and tanks of oxygen and acetylene burst. One man was killed and several
others wounded. —Daily Photo by Bob Culver
