United States trackmen, led by Perry O'Brien who put the shot
a record-breaking 57 feet, 1.44 inches, swept through to win four

out of five track events held yester
day.
Victories by Jerome Riffle in the
broad jump (24 feet, 10 inches),
Lindy Remigino in a photo-finish
100 meter dash, and Charlie Moore,
who tied his own Olympic record
set Sunday, at 50.8 in the 400 meter
hurdles—all added to Walt Davis'
record high jump leap of 6 feet,
8.32 inches on Sunday gave the
USA five gold medal winners thus

Fuehs, world record holder, third.
In the 100 meters Dean Smith
picked up a fourth, and in the broad
jump Cornell's Meredith Gourdine

an inch and a half behind Biffle.
UCLA's George Brown, favorite in
the long leap, fouled on each of his
three jumps to put himself oufof the
running.
In rowing, Stanford's pair-oared
crew finished fourth in a semi-final
heat behind Italy, Belgium, and

Poland to place it just one-strike
from bowing out of competition.
With both Dewey Hecht and Jim
Fifer suffering from chest colds, the
Indians just didn't have the steam
and finished 5.4 off Italy's
