TEHACHAPI, Calif., July 21 (UP) —The second hardest earth
quake recorded in California history destroyed the heart of this
town of 2,500 with the impact of a bomb today, killing 11 residents
and spreading tremors virtually the length and breadth of the
state.
Scores were injured as the "killer 'quake," just a cut under San.

►Francisco's devastating shaker of
190G, rolled out from beneath the
Tehachapi mountain - Mojave de->ert
rim and shook cities over a 700-mile
stretch just before dawn this morn
! ing.
| Property damage was estimated in
the millions, but no one could come
close to a dollar figure until more
j complete reports were in.
Damage reports poured in front
j communities as far north as Santa
[ Barbara, 100 miles away; Bakers
| field, 50 miles away where oil fires
' started; and the Eos Angeles area,
! KM) miles distant, where power
lines went out, windows were
broken.
Downtown Los Angeles skyscrap
ers swayed; burglar alarms rang out
as though the city were being in
vaded by an army of Jimmy Valen -
tines; the churchbell in Pasadena
swung and clanged; inmates in the
county jail in downtown Los Angeles,
12 floors above the street level, pan
icked and screamed for release from
their cells; power lines and trans
j formers shorted out in movie-sfcar
populated San Fernando valley.
The quake rolled along one of the
longest fractures in the rock cruet
of the world—the San Andreas Fault.
Above its epicenter the walls of Te
hachapi came tumbling down, turn
ing it into a city of death and terror.
