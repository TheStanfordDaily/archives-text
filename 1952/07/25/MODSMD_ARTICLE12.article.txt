CONVENTION HALL, CHI
CAGO, July 24 (UP) —President
Truman threw his powerful sup
port behind Adlai E. Stevenson
tonight as the Democratic con
vention in a dramatic "har
mony" move allowed Virginia
to vote for a Presidential nomi
nee despite its refusal to sign a
"loyalty" pledge.
The President's public endorse
ment of the reluctant Illinois Gov -
ernor pushed him toward an almost
certain early-ballot victory.
Mr. Truman's long-awaited deci
sion was disclosed here and at the
White House as the Democrats' 31st
national convention all but blew up
in an angry civil rights fight almost
as bitter as the battle tour years
ago when four Southern states
walked out.
The battle came in the midst of
nominating speeches for President,
but after the three front - runni:i 4
candidates — Stevenson, Sen. Estes
Kefauver, and Sen. Richard B Rus
sell — had been placed before the
convention. Five others also had
been nominated before the battle
broke out.
By a roll call vote of 615 to 523,
the convention reversed a ruling by
Chairman Sam Rayburn and voted
to let the Virginia delegation cast:
ballots in convention business even
though it had refused to sign, the
disputed loyalty pledge.
