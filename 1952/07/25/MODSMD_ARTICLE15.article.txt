Two weeks ago when Excorn was grappling with the problem of
official graduate representation among its summer membership,
t became entangled in a mess of conflicting opinions and hurt feel- i
nqs. Last week Excom, with the co-operation of the graduate stu- j
dents, voted to recommend a sane change in the ASSU constitu
tion.
T his recommendation was the result of research and co-opera
ion from all sides. At the height of the controversy Ed Council
md Excom realized they had independently scheduled two sepa- j
social events on the same night. Ed Council quickly post-;
poned its all-campus function.
This is plain evidence of the willingness of two high-level or- j
to get together and solve common problems. While
some baffling details remain, Excom and the graduate students
lave provided the machinery for progress.
T he next step will take time. It will involve a mature understand-1
nqof what both graduate and undergraduate students are looking
or and what they will support during summer quarter. Many stu
dents seriously engaged in working for advanced degrees have
leither the time nor the desire to attend social events sponsored (
primarily by and for undergraduate students. But there are also
)thers, especially unmarried graduate students, who will enjoy
-tnd participate in these affairs.
ad Council and Summer Excom deserve the praise and interest
all students for taking the first step toward this understanding.
