### 
HELSINKI, July 24 (UP)—Harrison (Bones) Dillard of Cleveland
erased four years of bitter disappointment today by streaking to
a new Olympic record in the 110-meter hurdles with two team
mates pounding at his heels for the third 1-2-3 finish by Americans
in the 1952 Games.
Failing to make the sguad as a hurdler in 1948, Dillard won some

consolation by bagging the Olympic*
100-meter dash title; but he vowed j
to come back in his specialty.
The finish, however, was so close j
that Jack Davis of Glendale, Calif., j
also was clocked in 13.7 in second
place. Art Barnard of Los Angeles j
was third.
Dillard's "revenge" triumph, giv

ing the U.S. its 14th gold medal to
13 for Russia, highlighted another
day of record - setting with an un
usual twist.
Bounding Emil Zatopek of
Czechosiivakia won his second gold
medal of the Games with a new rec
ord in the 5,000-meter run and his
wife, Dana, set a new mark for
women javelin throwers.
Despite the steady drive by
American track and field aces. Rus
sia still held a commanding lead in
the unofficial team race with 327
points to 221 for the U.S. Russia
compiled much of its total in gym
nastics.- -
