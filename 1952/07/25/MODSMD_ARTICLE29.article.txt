Before a large Tuesday Evening
Series audience. Dr. Richard Ma
hard, visiting professor of geogra
i phy at Stanford, presented a picto
j rial tour of the Colorado Plateau
including Bryce Canyon, Grand
| Canyon, and the Petrified Forest
this week.
The plateau is located in four
j states, Colorado, Utah,' Arizona, and
New Mexico. The two men most
J responsible for the initial develop
ment of this area are John Powell
and Carl Gilbert, who were early
1 explorers of this region.
Mahard said this area .is a unique
! and important geological region in
that all five of the geological pe-
I riod of time are represented here.
He further stated that this area has
aided geologists in studies of factors
and causes of erosion.
; Dr. Mahard explained that this
j region is one of startling remote
' ness. There is no attraction for
j farmers, nor are there any valuable
| minerals. This area of 35,000 square
miles is without a hardtop road. He
' stated that if a line was stretched
I 200 miles along the northern Ari-

I zona border, and one 300 miles long
i from Holbrook, Arizona, northward,
■ neither line would cross or touch a
| hardtop road.
I The Colorado Plateau, according
i to Mahard. is a land of spectacular
| beauty, magnificent distance, and
i stillness and dignity.
