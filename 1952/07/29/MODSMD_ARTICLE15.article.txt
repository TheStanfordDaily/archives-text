"The Finnish language is so hard that all Finns under 21 are speech- j
Jess."
This was said by Mr. Red Smith, ace sports columnist for the New York
Herald-Tribune, and I submit that there is a lot of truth in what Mr.
Smith says.
What Finnish kid's tongue wouldn't be tied up in knots after reading
i comic strip called "Yksinainen Ratsastaja"? "Yksinainen Ratsastaja," j
<n case your Finnish is under par these days, is the "Lone Ranger."
My language difficulties started the very hour that 112 landed on Finnish
soil. A week ago, I. flew in at 2:30 in the morning, stepped out of the rain

into a taxi, and gave the driver my address (on paper). ;
The driver couldn't quite negotiate the problem, and
took me to the wrong address.
I attempted to suggest to him that we drive back !
to the air terminal where one of those loveable inter
preters could set him straight.
"Do you speak English?" I began simply enough.
No response.
"Parlez-vous francais?" I Charles Boyered.
Still no answer.
"Sprechen Sie Deutsch?"
"Habla usted eipahol?"
After we had gotten down to '"Gallia est divisa in

partes tres" and Sanscrit, I went through several games of charades and i
finally put over my point. But it was a tough fight, Maw.

The other day, I went to the place where the women athletes are
loused to look up Sharon Geary, the Stanford swimming phenom who
is on the U.S. team. Sharon greeted me and invited me up to the second
floor to the dining room to have cTmner with her.
So there I was. in a dining hall full of the best women athletes in the
.vorld . . . the only male. I am a Stanford man, accustomed to a three-to
one ratio, and, admittedly, I basked in the glory of it all. Then one of
he chief roosters stepped out. scolded Sharon for inviting me up, and
informed me that no men were allowed past the first floor. With my face
indistinguishable from the tomato on the plate in front of me, I apolo
gized. bade a pleasant farewell to all the girls, and furtively crept out.
Ah, but the glorious ratio of it all.

A word on Helsinki. It is the second-most northern capital in the world
and has a population of 400,000. Only 20 minutes away by car is a Russian
laval base, but there is much less fear of war here than there is in the
United States. The Finns have a decided dislike for the Russians, but
'he diplomatic relations are cordial and correct. They have to be.
The Finnish people are shy, but at once likeable and wholesome. They
lave done a remarkable job in preparing for the Olympics and have bent
over backward in being the model hosts.
Finland, besides being peopled by wonderful hosts, is brimming over
.vith physical charm. But the language? Well, that's something else again.
I must be on my way now. Have to read "Yksinainen Ratsastaja."
