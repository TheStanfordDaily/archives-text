## Punts and Pitches Olympic Notes 
### 
HELSINKI, July 24 —Bob Mathias has confided that he may turfi
out for baseball instead of track next spring. Although it would
be great if Mr. Track could compete in both sports, PCC rules for
bid it, so either Jack Weiershauser or Ev Dean will be one disap
pointed man come next season.
Mathias, who is currently applying the clinching arguments on
the great debate over who is the greatest athlete of all time—he
or Jim Thorpe—holds a position of uniqueness here at the Games.

Whereas all the competitors are
pestered for autographs by Finnish
kids, Tulare Bob is the only one
besieged for autographs by fellow
athletes.
Strangely enough Ignace Hein
rich of Fiance, who is expected to
be Mathias' chief threat in the de
cathlon, is his closest friend here.
(Editor's note: Heinrich had to
drop from the decathlon after the
sixth event. An ankle injured in
the high jump forced him out.)
Heinrich and Mathias clear the lan
guage barrier by conversing in
French, which Bob studied for two
years at Stanford. Goes to show the
language requirement isn't all for
nought.
Crew: No Riches
•
What-,'could have been a rags-to
riches story for the United States
(Stanford) pair oar with coxswain
crew netfer fully materialized as the
Indian -boating lost by a third of a
length to Germany, the eventual
second-place finisher, to be elimi
nated from the rowing tourney.
Devvsy Hecht and Jim Fifer, who
with coxswain Jim Beggs comprised
the crew that had paid its own way
through the Olympic Trials, both
came down with chest colds after
practicing in the rain here.
In their first race, with the colds
not fully developed, Hecht, Fifer,
and Beggs rowed a wire-to-wire
triumph by % - length over the
shells from Sweden, Turkey, and
Egypt.
In the semi-finals the Cards got
off their worst effort and ran last
in a field of four. Under the Olym
pic double elimination system, the
United States craft had one more

chance—against Germany and Rus
sia.
The colds were better, but Ger
many led by a length and a half at j
the end of 1,000 meters. At the
1,500-meter mark, coxswain Beggs
called ✓for the Americans to catch |
fire; but it was too late.
Whittling down the Germans' lead
stroke by stroke, the Cards couldn't
quite catch therri and lost by one
third of a length. Most observers
agreed: "If the United States had
begun its rally five strokes sooner,
it would have caught Germany."
One consolation, however . . . four
lengths back of Stanford was the
badly beaten third boat . . . Russia.
