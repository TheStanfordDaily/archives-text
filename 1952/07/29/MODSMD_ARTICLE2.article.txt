# Mathias Leads U.S.A. Sweep With Second Decathlon Crown
## 
### JIM MADISON Summer Daily Sports Editor 
THE WINNAH AND STILL CHAMPEEN .. . 808 MATHIAS!!!
In an Olympic Games where records were set by the score;
where the United States won an unprecedented 14 out of 24 men's
track and field events; where Czechoslovakia's phenomenal Emil
Zatopek won an incredible three events in distance running; and

where Zatopek's wife triumphed in
the women's javelin to complete the
first husband-wife gold medal team
in Olympic history — the second
straight victory of Tulare and Stan
ford's Bob Muthias in the decathlon
stood out above all.
Competing on the second day
with a pinched nerve in his left
thigh, Mathias still came through
like he was heralded to set a new
world and Olympic record of 7,887
points for the ten events.
Completely spreadeagling the
field, Mathias led the United States
to its fourth sweep of the Games
track events with a lead of almost
900 points over second-place Mil
ton Campbell, New Jersey high
school junior^-
And again, as in 1943, when he
finished he said: "This is it . . . I'm
through."
' Best ever" performances in the
javelin and pole vault made the
record possible. Bob led the field
in both of these with a vault of 13
feet 1.16 inches and a nrodit^ious

spear throw of 194 feet 3.13 inches.
Up to the pole vault, Mathias had
been consistently behind his sec
ond-day output at the Games trials
in Tulare; he had been 27 points
behind his previous first-day mark,
also set at Tulare.
Brutus Hamilton, U.S. Olympic
coach, explained both days' per
formances by saying that after an
early morning nap Bob just wasn't
completely awake until the after
noon events.
And the record bore him out.
Bob's lowest marks on the first
day came in the morning broad
jump and 100 meters. His lowest on
the second day were in the disc and
hurdles. All the rest bettered his
Tulare achievements.
Following are Mathias' complete
marks and the order of finish:
100 meters, : 10.9; broad jump. 22-
10.80; shot put. 50-2.37; high jump,
6-2.81; 400 meters, :50.2; high hur
dles, : 14.7; discus, 153-10.00; pole
vault, 13-1.16; javelin, 194-3.15;
1.500 meters, 4:50.8.
Finish (first six): Bob Mathias,
U.S.A., 7,887; Milton Campbell,
U.S.A., 6,989; Floyd Simmons,
U.S.A., 6,785; Vladimir Volkov, Rus

In an Olympic Games where records were set by the score;
where the United States won an unprecedented 14 out of 24 men's
track and field events; where Czechoslovakia's phenomenal Emil
Zatopek won an incredible three events in distance running; and

where Zatopek's wife triumphed in
the women's javelin to complete the
first husband-wife gold medal team
in Olympic history — the second
straight victory of Tulare and Stan
ford's Bob Muthias in the decathlon
stood out above all.
Competing on the second day
with a pinched nerve in his left
thigh, Mathias still came through
like he was heralded to set a new
world and Olympic record of 7,887
points for the ten events.
Completely spreadeagling the
field, Mathias led the United States
to its fourth sweep of the Games
track events with a lead of almost
900 points over second-place Mil
ton Campbell, New Jersey high
school junior^-
And again, as in 1943, when he
finished he said: "This is it . . . I'm
through."
' Best ever" performances in the
javelin and pole vault made the
record possible. Bob led the field
in both of these with a vault of 13
feet 1.16 inches and a nrodit^ious

spear throw of 194 feet 3.13 inches.
Up to the pole vault, Mathias had
been consistently behind his sec
ond-day output at the Games trials
in Tulare; he had been 27 points
behind his previous first-day mark,
also set at Tulare.
Brutus Hamilton, U.S. Olympic
coach, explained both days' per
formances by saying that after an
early morning nap Bob just wasn't
completely awake until the after
noon events.
And the record bore him out.
Bob's lowest marks on the first
day came in the morning broad
jump and 100 meters. His lowest on
the second day were in the disc and
hurdles. All the rest bettered his
Tulare achievements.
Following are Mathias' complete
marks and the order of finish:
100 meters, : 10.9; broad jump. 22-
10.80; shot put. 50-2.37; high jump,
6-2.81; 400 meters, :50.2; high hur

vault, 13-1.16; javelin, 194-3.15;

Finish (first six): Bob Mathias,
