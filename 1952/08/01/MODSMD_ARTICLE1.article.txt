## 
### JIM MADISON 
The opening day's events in Sta.n
ford's first annual Hamburger De
cathlon are expected to attract a
large crowd of onlookers to Angell
Field tomorrow afternoon. The first
event is scheduled to begin at 1
p.m.; admission is free.
The first contest of its kind ever
to be conducted at Stanford, the de
cathlon has attracted an entry list of
11 and possibly 12 men—all contest
ing for the title of "the poor man's
Bob Mathias."
Pre-meet favorite is Tom Rowe,
who actually competed in the Na
tional AAU decathlon this year at
Tulare and finished 21 places behind
Mathias while scoring 3,473 points.
included among Rowe's competi
tors are a bevy of local athletes
whose best events range from the
javetin to the 400 meters.
Ron Allen, varsity high jumper
with a mark of G feet 2 inches, heads
the list of those who will be out to
beat Rowe. Then there's Hank
Beckwith, who in practice the last
week has vaulted 11 feet 6 inches
and thrown the javelin 165 feet.
