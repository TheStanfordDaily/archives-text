### HADLEY ROFF Daily Political Editor 
(Daily Political Editor Hadley Rolf this week obtained in San Fian
isco the interview printed below from Sen. Richard Nixon, Republican
nominee for Vice-President. This article is part of a series on political
leaders and the current Presidential campaign.)
The Republicans learned a bitter lesson in 1948 —that you can't win an
election with polite, tea-table talk.
So in the artery-popping campaign of 1952 the GOP is planning to
vage a brass-knuckles fight, a fight based on President Truman's "give
em hell" campaign tactics.
Speaking in San Francisco Tuesday, the Republicans' serious-faced
young Vice-Presidential candidate, Sen. Richard Nixon of California, out-
Uned a hard, determined campaign that "will take nothing for granted."
As 3.300 well-wishers looked on, the curly-haired Senator said he
uid his star running mate, Dwight Eisenhower, plan to campaign "in
every part of the nation humanly possible to get to."
"he Senator, whose brows are almost continually knit in a determined
'rown, told the cheering throng that he and the general realized that a
ighHng campaign was needed.
He said the general was "full of vim, vigor, and vitality" and was
inxious to stump the country and answer some of the charges leveled
gainst him at the Democratic convention last week.
Nixon, who spent last Sunday with Eisenhower at his Rocky Mountain
etreat, said Ike intends to do a great deal of campaign travel, including
\ stump tour of California.
IVlost of the campaign tour will be made by train with hundreds of
vvhistle-stop talks planned.
Calling upon Republican district workers to cast oIT any feeling of
over-confidence and to work determinedly in routing out the vote, the
39-year-old Senator said in that way California can he carried.
At a press conference late Tuesday, Nixon said he expects to direct
nuch of his campaigning toward the youth of the nation. He said youth
should be drafted into the party for "it is with them that the future of
.he party lies."
Outlining the issues, he said the major issue will be foreign policy. He
said the policy in Asia will be one of the trumpeting pieces of the GOP.
He confessed he had no plans in mind for quickly ending the Korean
var, but said he and Eisenhower did have plans which would prevent
future Koreas. He declined to dircuss the plans, saying that he preferred
o withhold comment until the campaign was in full swing.
Corruption and Communism will be other big issues, the Senator de
clared.
Nixon claimed the administration is '"sodden with corruption" and
hat the resulting stench would infect and politically emasculate the effec
tiveness of the Democratic standard bearer, Gov. Adlai Stevenson of
Illinois.
"Despite his high intents heis marked as a city machine and boss
kicked candidate," Nixon said of Stevenson.
According to Nixon. Stevenson was a stronger candidate before the
Democratic convention than after "because of the way he was nomi
lated."
Nixon maintains that Stevenson was named to nomination by Presi
lent Truman and Jake Arvey, a notorious Chicago political king.
Of Sparkman, Nixon had nothing to say. He merely shrugged.
vt a reception held for Nixon in the gold and velvet of the St. Francis
Hotel, more than 3,000 people stood in line to shake hands with the youth
ul legislator. He estimated that he met 300 people every 15 minutes,
fiis right hand was watermelon-color and swollen when he met with the
oress several hours later.

At a press conference late Tuesday, Nixon said he expects to direct
nuch of his campaigning toward the youth of the nation. He said youth
should be drafted into the party for "it is with them that the future of
.he party lies."
Outlining the issues, he said the major issue will be foreign policy. He
said the policy in Asia will be one of the trumpeting pieces of the GOP.
He confessed he had no plans in mind for quickly ending the Korean
var, but said he and Eisenhower did have plans which would prevent
future Koreas. He declined to dircuss the plans, saying that he preferred
o withhold comment until the campaign was in full swing.
Corruption and Communism will be other big issues, the Senator de
clared.
Nixon claimed the administration is '"sodden with corruption" and
hat the resulting stench would infect and politically emasculate the effec
tiveness of the Democratic standard bearer, Gov. Adlai Stevenson of
Illinois.
"Despite his high intents heis marked as a city machine and boss
kicked candidate," Nixon said of Stevenson.
According to Nixon. Stevenson was a stronger candidate before the
Democratic convention than after "because of the way he was nomi
lated."
Nixon maintains that Stevenson was named to nomination by Presi
lent Truman and Jake Arvey, a notorious Chicago political king.
Of Sparkman, Nixon had nothing to say. He merely shrugged.
vt a reception held for Nixon in the gold and velvet of the St. Francis
Hotel, more than 3,000 people stood in line to shake hands with the youth
ul legislator. He estimated that he met 300 people every 15 minutes,
fiis right hand was watermelon-color and swollen when he met with the
oress several hours later.

nominee for Vice-President. This article is part of a series on political

The Republicans learned a bitter lesson in 1948 —that you can't win an
election with polite, tea-table talk.
So in the artery-popping campaign of 1952 the GOP is planning to
vage a brass-knuckles fight, a fight based on President Truman's "give
em hell" campaign tactics.
Speaking in San Francisco Tuesday, the Republicans' serious-faced
young Vice-Presidential candidate, Sen. Richard Nixon of California, out-
Uned a hard, determined campaign that "will take nothing for granted."
As 3.300 well-wishers looked on, the curly-haired Senator said he
uid his star running mate, Dwight Eisenhower, plan to campaign "in
every part of the nation humanly possible to get to."
"he Senator, whose brows are almost continually knit in a determined
'rown, told the cheering throng that he and the general realized that a
ighHng campaign was needed.
He said the general was "full of vim, vigor, and vitality" and was
inxious to stump the country and answer some of the charges leveled
gainst him at the Democratic convention last week.
Nixon, who spent last Sunday with Eisenhower at his Rocky Mountain
etreat, said Ike intends to do a great deal of campaign travel, including
\ stump tour of California.
IVlost of the campaign tour will be made by train with hundreds of
vvhistle-stop talks planned.
