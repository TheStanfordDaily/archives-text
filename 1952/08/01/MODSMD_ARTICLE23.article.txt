## U.S. Casaba Squad Gains Games Finals 
### 
The United States basketball team
finally got off the dime yesterday
and won its way into the finals of
the Olympic Tournament for a
showdown with Russia by downing
Argentina in a high-scoring battle,
83 to 76.
Big Clyde Lovellete of Kansas
didn't miss on either backboard, as
he is shown doing against Chile in
the picture to the right, but poured
in a total of 27 points to pace the
seventh straight American win.
Lovellete was the difference in
the rough game—six Americans and
two of the peppy but outreached
Argentines fouled out —as he came
through in the clutches time and
time again.
Russia, which already has lost to
the U.S. once, reached the finals by
defeating Uruguay, 61 to 57, in an
even harder-played game.
In swimming, Americans cracked
three of five records broken, and
Major Sammy Lee piled up a com
manding lead in defense of his plat
form diving title.
In sizzling qualifying perform
ances, Evelyn Kawamoto of Hawaii
whipped through the women's 400-
meter freestyle in 5 minutes 16.G
seconds and clipped 1.2 seconds off
the old Olympic record set in 1948
by Ann Curtis of the United States.
Gerald Holan, Ohio State star from
Westchester, HI., set a new 200-
meter breaststroke record of 2 min
utes 36.8 seconds. Yoshinobu Oyo
kawa, Ohio State student from Ho
nolulu, splashed through the 100-
meter backstroke in 1:05.7.
