# Stern Will Host Campus At Free Dance Saturday
## 
### 
''Night in Vienna," the semi-for
mal to be held at Stern from 9 to 1
tomorrow night, is a free all-cam
pus dance. Dress is semi-formal,
which means that men may wear
suits or tuxedos and women may
wear either cocktail dresses cr for
mats.
Men are asked not to give their
dates corsages, as Stanford tradition
reserves corsages for the Senior
Ball.
During the evening a specially
concocted punch and open - faced
sandwiches will be served. Music
will be provided by Spike Lynch
and his 12-piece orchestra.
