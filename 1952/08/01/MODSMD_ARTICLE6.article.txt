# Dr. Kroner to Be Guest Preacher Sunday Morning
## 
### 
Dr. Richard Kroner, emeritus pro
fessor of the philosophy of religion
at the Union Theological Seminary,
New York, will be the guest preach
er at the 11 a.m. service Sunday in
Memorial Church.
There will be a service of Holy
Communion conducted by the Rev.
Alexander Miller at 9 a.m. in the
church.
Reviewing Dr. Kroner's recent
book, ''Culture and Faith," Dr.
Reinhoid Niebuhr said: '"The gen
ius of Dr. Kroner as a teacher of
theology is that he arrived at the
ultimate affirmations of the Chris
tian faith by passing through the
disciplines of philosophy. Dr. Kro
ner's spiritual pilgrimage is a guide,
even as it is a parallel, for the spir
itual pilgrimage of our era."
