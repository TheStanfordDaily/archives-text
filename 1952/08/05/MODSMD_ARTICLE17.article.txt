# PETE GROTHE
## OUTSIDE STANFORD 
### 
HELSINKI—The Finnish army band played the "Star Spangled Ban
ner," Old Glory was hoisted to the top of the flagpole, and 70,000 stood at
attention as Stanford's Bob Mathias received his second Olympic gold
fneaai.
If there was any doubt of it before this carnival of exertion began, it
has been dispelled—that Bob Mathias now stands as the world's most
lerfeot athlete.
He's just barely old enough to vote, but right now they're mentioning
"lis name in the same hallowed tones usually reserved for Babe Ruth, Jim
'Thorpe, and Red Grange.
The fact that the doctor's son from Tulare won the Olympic decath
lon championship, the fact that he set an Olympic record, and the fact
'hat he shattered his own world's record are only part of the story. The
it her part, less well known, concerns the conditions under which he
uhieved his glory.
In he second event in the decathlon, the broad jump, Mathias got off
i bad jump and pulled a ifcuscle on the back of his left leg. It pained
lim so that he had to retire from the high jump after making 6 ft. 2 : U
n. Mathias' second handicap in breaking his own record, set at the
Olympic trials at Tulare, was explained by Olympic Track Coach Brutus
Hamilton. •
Mthough the Finnish have done a wonderful job in running off the
nvents, I feel that they took way too long to run off the decathlon. It
ook approximately 12 hours both days. Most people have no idea how
•difficult it is to set any type of a record when the meet is stretched out
over a long period of time.
'It means that the athlete's nervous tension has to endure a longer
sfl-eteh. and it takes a lot out of his physical energy. When Boh set
he record at Tulare, the conditions were ideal, because the meet was
■un off quickly. But, as I say, people have no idea how hard it is to
lo well when one competes two days in a row for 12 hours each day."
Respite the handicaps that the six-foot-three Stanford senior worked
under, he chalked up his all-time bests in four events—the 400 meters,
fie 1,500 meters, the javelin, and the pole vault.
Vlathias' victory had an unusual type of drama to it. In most athletic
ontests, the thrills are provided by the struggle between two teams or
ndividual athletes. Such was not the case in the decathlon. After the
first few events, a Mathias win seemed inevitable.
No, the real drama might he entitled "Mathias vs. Mathias." Boh
nail already outdistanced his competition. What he was trying to do
was set the world record, which was held by no one other than him
iell.
't was quite important that he do this, because this was to be his
last decathlon competition. He was giving it up after the '52 Olympics.
■ And the goal that lie had set up tor himself a long time ago was to break
he Olympic and world record in the Olympic Games.
He appeared to be a cinch to set an Olympic record, but the world
•eeorri was an apple of another color. He got off a 10.9 hundred meters.

jy lussing it 50 feet 3 inches, the best he has done this year. He picked
ip a few points also in the high jump, jumping his height, almost 6 ft. 3 in.,
un c:i uldn't try'for a loftier height because of the muscle pull.
r hen, in the last event of the day, held at 9:45 p.m., he did his all
'ime b-st in the 400 meters, zipping off the distance in 50.2. That left him
27 ,am.its behind his Tulare performance for the first day. On Saturday
• o>ning, his performances in the hurdles and discus were below his world
itle standards, and he dropped considerably off the pace that he had
vfinted to set.
At this point, a Finnish official with a decathlon score book informed
Bob that he would have to do his all-time bests in the last three events
o break his own record.
Here was an assignment. Ninety-nine out of a hundred athletes
.vould have quavered at the challenge. But the doctor's son from Tulare
was not just any athlete. It took the world's best athlete to meet the

e--athlon man, Mathias included, hated most. At Tulare, he had run off
.500 meters (close to a mile) in 4:55.3.
It was close to 10 at night, although no one would know it in this
land of the midnight sun. Bob had been competing since 10 a.m. Do,g
