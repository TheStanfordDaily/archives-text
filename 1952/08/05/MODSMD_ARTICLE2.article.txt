# Sanders Scores 5,599 Points To Cop Hamburger Decathlon
## 
### 
Freshman Don Sanders, first
string defensive halfback on last
rail's gridiron squad, was the last
man to enter the first annual "Ham- !
burger Decathlon" late last Friday,
but by the close of competition on
Sunday afternoon he was far and
away the foremost, having piled up
a total of 5,599 points to 4.3(31 for his
nearest opponent, Tom Rowe.
Although Don won only two of j
the individual events, he came j
through with five seconds (one ir j
the discus which he had never ;
thrown before), two thirds, and a
fourth to amass his score with all
around consistency.
Sanders took his firsts in the
broad jump (20 feet 11 inches) and
the high hurdles (15.9).
Realizing that Sanders, like all
the rest of the entrants, performed
I'j.st for a weekend's fun (and what
grueling fun it was) and without i
any training — his score, compiled I
under the old point system, com
pares quite well with Bob Mathias'
Olympic trvouts score —8,385 points,
when converted into the old system.
Rcwe, varsity high jumper, won j
vhe fastest 1.500-meter of his life in
5:02 at to edge out Ron Allen for
the second spot by a scant 17 points.
