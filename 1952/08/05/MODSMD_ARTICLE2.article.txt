## 
### 
Freshman Don Sanders, first
string defensive halfback on last
rail's gridiron squad, was the last

Sunday afternoon he was far and
away the foremost, having piled up
a total of 5,599 points to 4.3(31 for his
nearest opponent, Tom Rowe.
Although Don won only two of j
the individual events, he came j
through with five seconds (one ir j
the discus which he had never ;
thrown before), two thirds, and a
fourth to amass his score with all
around consistency.
Sanders took his firsts in the
broad jump (20 feet 11 inches) and
the high hurdles (15.9).
Realizing that Sanders, like all
the rest of the entrants, performed
I'j.st for a weekend's fun (and what
grueling fun it was) and without i
any training — his score, compiled I
under the old point system, com
pares quite well with Bob Mathias'
Olympic trvouts score —8,385 points,
when converted into the old system.
Rcwe, varsity high jumper, won j
vhe fastest 1.500-meter of his life in
5:02 at to edge out Ron Allen for

seconds and his favorite event, the
high leap, at 6 feet even.

ribbons, with a total of 4,473 points.
He won the shot at 43 feet 2 inches;
the disc at 103 feet 11 inches; and
the javelin at 148 feet even.
The pole vault was won by fifth

even height of 10 feet. Roy Deft'e

Freshman Don Sanders, first
string defensive halfback on last
rail's gridiron squad, was the last
man to enter the first annual "Ham- !
burger Decathlon" late last Friday,
but by the close of competition on
Sunday afternoon he was far and
away the foremost, having piled up
a total of 5,599 points to 4.3(31 for his
nearest opponent, Tom Rowe.
Although Don won only two of j
the individual events, he came j
through with five seconds (one ir j
the discus which he had never ;
thrown before), two thirds, and a
fourth to amass his score with all
around consistency.
Sanders took his firsts in the
broad jump (20 feet 11 inches) and
the high hurdles (15.9).
Realizing that Sanders, like all
the rest of the entrants, performed
I'j.st for a weekend's fun (and what
grueling fun it was) and without i
any training — his score, compiled I
under the old point system, com
pares quite well with Bob Mathias'
Olympic trvouts score —8,385 points,
when converted into the old system.

vhe fastest 1.500-meter of his life in
