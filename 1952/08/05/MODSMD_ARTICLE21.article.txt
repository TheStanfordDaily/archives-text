HELSINKIâ€”Like any athletic event, the Olympics has its drama.
Next to Bob Mathias' performance, the one that will stand out the
longest in my memory is that of Bob Richards, the pole-vaulting
preacher from Champagne, Illinois.
The Olympic record was 14 feet 3 inches, and the amiable Rich-

ards had outlasted all competition
and was trying for a new mark of 14
feet llVu inch. The 2G - year - old
parson missed his first try, just
barely grazing the crossbar. He took
a rest, thfen measured the distance
again, and went after his second at
tempt. Still no success . . . his arm
tipped the crossbar off its heavenly
haunch.
While Richards was resting for his
third try,, whole stadium was
conjecturing,"in quite a few lan
guages and dialects, whether he
would make it.
Two Englishmen were sitting be
hind me. One said, "If you make
this, Bob old top. you'll have a
bloody bigci'onffregation next Sun
day."
The second added, "Let's see if
you can get up to the place where
you're pveaching everyone else
.should go.''
The first threw in, "Righto, give
'im some help. Saint Peter."
Now Richards measured off the
distance for this third and final at
tempt. No one dropped a pin, but
they could have, it was so quiet. He
paused for a minute, said a short
prayer, and then with pole in hand
he charged for the pit. He stuck the
pole in .the, box, slingshot himself
over 15 feet in the air, and then
dropped to the sawdust.
He looked up, saw the crossbar
at the same place it had been a
moment hsfore, and gave a whoop
that could- have been heard as
far as Moscow. He leaped out of
the pit, threw kisses to the wildly
cheering crowd, and was embraced
by Viktor Knje/ev, a Russian
vaulter.
Other defeated pole vaulters raced
up to him and hugged him. Then,
in one of the most disarming dem
onstrations of uncontained joy. he
ran half around the stadium,
whooping and blowing kisses.
