# Stanford Warns Hunting Illegal Onc University Lands
## 
### 
It is illegal to hunt on Stanford
lands, the University warned yes
terday.
This note of caution was issued by
Alf E. Brandin, business manager
of the University, as nimrods were
preparing for the opening of deer
season tomorrow.
Brandin pointed out that, al
though Stanford's 9,000 acres are
not part of a game refuge, all of
the area is either enclosed by fence
or posted against hunting. It is a
violation of state law to trespass or
hunt on private property protected
in this way.
Hunters would endanger students
and scientists who use Stanford
fields and foothill areas for experi
mental purposes, as well as tenants
who lease University property for
farming and grazing, Brandin
pointed out.
Persons living along the edge of
Stanford property are also endan
gered by the activities of deer hunt
ers, the business manager stated.
These nearby residents and Univer
sity tenants have declared they are
ready to prosecute violators, he said.
