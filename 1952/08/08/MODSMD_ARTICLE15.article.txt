# 'CONDITION NOT CRITICAL'
## California Colleges Complete Plan to Prevent Communism 
### 
A long-range plan to present- a
solid academic front against any
passible Communist infiltration of
institutes of higher education ha?
been completed by California, the
first state in the Union to adopt
such a plan.
Announcing the plan, in which 17
of California's major universities
and college?, including Stanford,
have agreed to participate. State
Senator Hugh M. Burns, Fresno,
said, "No inference should be drawn
that there is a sudden epidemic of
infiltration, or that a criti
'saL condition among partici
pating institutions.
--"The plan is simply a CJ-operative
effort to assist the colleges ani uni
versities in their continuing tight
against the highly developed tech
niques used by the Communist par

ty to insinuate its members into key
positions on our college campuses.
. . . Heretofore, the institutions have
acted independently, and we feel
that it is time the effort be co-ordi
nated. We will use every precau
tion to preserve academic freedom
in its true sense."
Burns Is chairman of the Senate
Fact - Finding Committee on Un-
American Activities.
The California institutions agreed j
to participate in the plan in a series j
of two conferences held this past '
spring, one in Los Angeles and the .
second in San Francisco.
In the only detail of the plan re
leased, Burns said, "Through this
co-operative plan each institution
will designate a representative with
whom the oommittee can maintain o
constant liaison."
