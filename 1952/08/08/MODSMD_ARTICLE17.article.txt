# PETE GROTHE
## OUTSIDE STANFORD BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN 
### 
I went out to Otiniemi the other day. Otiniemi is the pine-infested
j£imp of the Iron Curtain countries. Visiting hours for the press are re
stricted from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. And the minute a molder of public opinion
arrives at the guarded Commie athletic camp, a guide is slapped on him,
•md the reporter is shown only the places the Russians want shown.
Now. I am not at all in favor of guided tours, especially around places
that drip with intrigue, such as the Russian camp. And so 1 sent my

"guide," who looked like a bad man in a Class B
movie, on an errand.
"Comrade," I lied, "I should be very interested in
seeing the box score of the Russian basketball game
against Bulgaria. Why don't you try to get me that
box score while I wait here. I would go with you, but
I find that my legs are very tired, and I need a rest."
With a gullible nod of his Russian head, my Russian
guide went his Russian way.
When he Wc's out of gunshot (a figure of speech),
I made my surreptitious way toward the Russian liv
ing quarters, taboo territory for American journalists.
Putting on a Bulgarian press badge (Bulgaria is an

Iron Curtain country) which I had gotten hold of, I casually walked past
the Russian guard with a neivous whistle on my lips and my heart beating
'triple-time.
I peered around the first two floors and saw nothing interesting. Then
I went up to the third floor and chanced into the Russian reading room.
As there was no one around, I picked up some of the literature lying on
lr .he table. Everything was in Russian, except one magazine, which was
(called "People's China." This was in English and not altogether flattering
to those of us who claim the stars and stripes. A few quotes cn germ
warfare will back up my point:
"By the deliberate dispersion of flies and other insects artificially in
fected with bacteria . . . , a most fjrave and horrible crime has been
perpetrated by U.S. forces in Korea."
"By the ill-treatment and torture of the civilian inhabitants . . . , the
U.S. forces have again broken the express provisions of the Hague
Regulations."
I picked up the magazine as a souvenir of the occasion, although I
was not altogether in agreement with what it said. However, the situa
tion was not perfect for me to argue my side of the case.
I looked out of the window, and saw that my guide had returned. Hav
ing not found me, he had contacted several other gentlemen, all of whom
were racing around, trying to find me. Not wanting to play in a sequel to
id Keystone Cops drama, I slipped out of the Russian dormitory and into
'tne spacious Russian dining hall. In the front of the room was a mammoth
picture of Stalin, and strung all around the walls were portraits of each
nember of the Politburo.
(Parenthetically, I feel it important to mention that despite the cool
ness of the Russian officials, the relations between American and Russian
athletes have been downright chummy. The Red athletes have shown a
ligh degree of sportsmanship and friendliness and have endeared them
selves to the U.S. athletes.)
At this point, my panting guide (and several of his helpers) found me.
112 allowed as how I was looking all over for him, and I thanked him
leartily for the box score on the Russian-Bulgarian basketball game.
Don't tell Senator McCarthy, but I rather enjoyed my left-wingish dav.
