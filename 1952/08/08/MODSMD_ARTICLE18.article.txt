# Farm Engineer Makes New Heart Stimulator

Looking for a defibrillator?
Probably not, unless you're a doc
or or hospital superintendent. But
-vhen a defibrillator is needed, it's
a matter of life or death. And the
sole world supplier is Albert J.
Morris, an electronic engineer who
listributes them from his home in
Redwood City.
Morris built his first defibrillator
jn his own time in a Stanford labo
-atory. A physician friend wanted
it for emergency use at a veterans'
lospital in San Francisco. In cases
of cardiac arrest with ventricular
fibrillation—that is, when the heart
stops pumping and remains help
lessly quivering—an electric shock
from a defibrillator may be the only
means of saving a patient.
Such occasions are rare, it's
true. And applying electric shock
is a last resort. But it recently
saved the life of a girl whose
heart stopped for an hour and 45
minutes while undergoing an op
eration in a Chicago hospital.
In that case a team of three doc
-01 s cut open her chest and took

turns massaging her heart by hand
until a home-made defibrillator was
rushed into the operating room.
Massage kept the blood circulating,
but failed to restore a normal beat.
Its erratic action halted by the
shock of the defibrillator, the heart
at last resumed a steady rhythm.
Other doctors and hospitals
wanted defibrillators as a kind of
insurance against such emergen
cies. Morris decided to manufac
ture them as a sideline since no
one else did. Defibrillators haven't
much of a commercial future, af
ter all — they don't cost much,
practically never wear out. and
only one is needed in a hospital.
Morris incorporated what he con
sidered the best features of existing,
specially built defibrillators in hi.s
model. It is about the size of a small
overnight bag, and operates on or
dinary house current. Two flat,
disc - shaped electrodes are held
against each side of the heart. These
administer shocks up to 135 volt;)
and of as short duration as two
hundredths of a second.

Looking for a defibrillator?
Probably not, unless you're a doc
or or hospital superintendent. But
-vhen a defibrillator is needed, it's
a matter of life or death. And the
sole world supplier is Albert J.
Morris, an electronic engineer who
listributes them from his home in
Redwood City.
Morris built his first defibrillator
jn his own time in a Stanford labo
-atory. A physician friend wanted
it for emergency use at a veterans'
lospital in San Francisco. In cases
of cardiac arrest with ventricular
fibrillation—that is, when the heart
stops pumping and remains help
lessly quivering—an electric shock
from a defibrillator may be the only
means of saving a patient.
Such occasions are rare, it's
true. And applying electric shock
is a last resort. But it recently
saved the life of a girl whose
heart stopped for an hour and 45
minutes while undergoing an op
eration in a Chicago hospital.
In that case a team of three doc
-01 s cut open her chest and took

turns massaging her heart by hand
until a home-made defibrillator was
rushed into the operating room.
Massage kept the blood circulating,
but failed to restore a normal beat.
Its erratic action halted by the
shock of the defibrillator, the heart
at last resumed a steady rhythm.
Other doctors and hospitals
wanted defibrillators as a kind of
insurance against such emergen
cies. Morris decided to manufac
ture them as a sideline since no
one else did. Defibrillators haven't
much of a commercial future, af
ter all — they don't cost much,
practically never wear out. and
only one is needed in a hospital.
Morris incorporated what he con
sidered the best features of existing,
specially built defibrillators in hi.s
model. It is about the size of a small
overnight bag, and operates on or
dinary house current. Two flat,
disc - shaped electrodes are held
against each side of the heart. These
administer shocks up to 135 volt;)
and of as short duration as two
hundredths of a second.
