as far away as Hawaii are expected |
to attend. Total registration will be j
limited to about 130.
The program offers a kind of
"back-to-school" week for doctors.
They attend classes in various fields
of medicine from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
every day, Monday through Fri- i
day. A large majority of those reg- j

medical schools throughout the na- I
t:on. â€ž
Stanford Postgraduate Medical
C inference courses are unique in
that they present actual cases for
study, rather than lectures alone.
Patients are examined and studied
during bedside visits or, at the very
least, illustrative case material is
otTered.
The conference is more than a j
"refresher course" for doctors, said |
Dr. Lowell A. Rantz, chairman of
Stanford Medical School's commit
tee on postgraduate education. It
is designed to familiarize them witr
new medical discoveries and the
latest methods of scientific treat- ;
ment.
