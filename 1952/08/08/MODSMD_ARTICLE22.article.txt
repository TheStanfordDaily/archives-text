A Look al the Decathlon
Its long since over now, the Olympic decathlon; but Stanford's summer
counterpart, the "Hamburger Decathlon," is less than a week old. so just
for the sake of having nothing else to do, let's try a bit of comparing.
From a track coach's viewpoint there ain't nothing to compare. Boh
Mathias made 7,875 points (about 8,500 under the old system) in winning
his second straight Olympic decathlon. He trained long and hard for the
event.
Don Sanders scored only 5,599 points under the old system while win
ning the title of "the poor man's Bob Mathias." That's roughly two-thirds
of Mathias' output. lie didn't train for the event. In fact, he just up and
competed in it for two afternoons' enjoyment.
Sure Don has had some good high school track experience. As the
memory serves, he placed in the high hurdles at the California high school
championships a year or so back.
Sanders in Top Fifteen
But the decathlon! That's rated track's most demanding event. And
for a guy just to pick out a weekend, any old weekend, and make a score
in. it that would have placed him among the top 15 or 16 decathlon pel
iormers in the U.S. at the Tulare meet a month ago—that shows us some
thing!
Somehow it makes us think that any guy with good co-ordination and
endurance can perform the decathlon successfully. And it leads to the
conclusion (hang us if this is heresy) that if more good all-around ath
letes subjected themselves to the killing grind of the 10-event test. Bob
Mathias wouldn t stick out like an Empire State Building among mud
hogans. Take nothing from Bob. He'd probably still be champion, because
he's great . . . one of the greatest.
The point is merely that the decathlon, is not competition for the gods
alone. Sanders and a half dozen or so others who competed for the
'Burger title have shown that any guy with guts and co-ordination can
fathom the ten events. And the point scores they made indicate that,
given some coaching and training, any -guy in the foregoing category can
conceivably make a score to rank him among the present near national
champions.
Let's try it some more in campus intramurals and see.

On the matter of Olj'mpic point see
