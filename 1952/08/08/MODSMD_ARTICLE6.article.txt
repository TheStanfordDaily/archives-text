tion of contemporary choral selec- j
tions in a concert Tuesday at 8 p.m.
in Stanford's Memorial Hall.
The program concludes the Uni
versity's Tuesday Evening Series of

in September.
The concert will include the \
fir>t complete performance of

resident composer at Syracuse
University, and formerly on the
Stanford music faculty. The com
position was written to me ( the !
demands of choral singing in
American community life.
Chansons, madrigals, and folk
songs by Hindemith, Ravel, Mar
tinu, Hoist, and Vaughn Williams
will be sung as examples of choral
writing without accompaniment.
The first American performance i
of a Christmas carol, a series of ;
three compositions written by Bar- j
ney Childs, Stanford graduate stu
dent in English, will be heard. The 1
compositions, "Preludium," "Salva- j
tor Mundi Est." and "Chorales," are ,
examples of medieval and contem- •
porary choral and instrumental
practice. The singing will be ac
companied by a brass ensemble.

loists, and double wind quintet
by Igor Stravinsky will conclude

sen, bass.
The Mass, written in 1948, is one
of the finest examples of contempo
rary choral writing today, according |
to Professor Schmidt, and is intend
ed for liturgical rather than concert
performance.
The unusual accompaniment com
bination of ten wind instruments,
he said, affords Stravinsky "a won
derful opportunity for exploiting
unusual choral and instrumental so
norities such as one finds in the I
"Octet' and 'Symphony of Psalms'."

The first American performance i
of a Christmas carol, a series of ;
three compositions written by Bar- j
ney Childs, Stanford graduate stu
dent in English, will be heard. The 1
compositions, "Preludium," "Salva- j
tor Mundi Est." and "Chorales," are ,
examples of medieval and contem- •
porary choral and instrumental
practice. The singing will be ac
companied by a brass ensemble.
The Mass for mixed chorus, so
loists, and double wind quintet
by Igor Stravinsky will conclude
the concert. Soloists are Dorothy
Kupke, soprano; Terry Weld, alto;
Clinton McGovern and Leonard
Weeks, tenors; and Robert Peter
sen, bass.
The Mass, written in 1948, is one
of the finest examples of contempo
rary choral writing today, according |
to Professor Schmidt, and is intend
ed for liturgical rather than concert
performance.
The unusual accompaniment com
bination of ten wind instruments,
he said, affords Stravinsky "a won
derful opportunity for exploiting
unusual choral and instrumental so
norities such as one finds in the I
"Octet' and 'Symphony of Psalms'."
