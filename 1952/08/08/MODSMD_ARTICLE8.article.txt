| ATHENS, Greece, Aug. 7 (UP)
j â€”The Greek army today drove
an invading Bulgarian force
from a disputed border isiand
with a four - hour mortar bom
bardment. The incident was fol
lowed closely by anxious West
ern capitals.
(Dispatches reaching the United
: Nations in New York said "big
i forces" of Greek and Bulgarian
' troops were ready for action in the
, northern Greek border area, and
' I that a "very dangerous situation"
| might develop if the Greeks resort
j ed to force.)
Greece is a member of the North.
Atlantic Treaty Organization and
could call for aid from all 14 NATO
| nations under the organization's
| charter which provides that an ag
gressive attack on one member of
the Atlantic community shall be re
garded as an attack on all.
Greek military observers report
ed "four or five" Bulgarians were
seen evacuating Gamma Island in
the Evros River which separates
Greece from its Soviet - satellite
neighbor. The tiny, eight acres is
land became the center of a bitter
dispute after Bulgarian forces oc
cupied it last July 23.
Greece described the Bulgarian
invasion of Gamma an "unprovoked
aggression against Greece and a fla
grant violation of international
law."
No immediate attempt was made
by Greek troops to occupy the island
and the Greek government said it
was agreeable to a United Nations
j investigation of its claim to posses -
j sion of the disputed area.
