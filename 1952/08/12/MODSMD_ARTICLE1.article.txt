WASHINGTON, Aug. 11 (UP) — The Army ordered Selective
Service today to induct 47,000 men in October, the largest draft call
since last February.
Simultaneously, a Selective Service spokesman said that "if calls
keep up like we expect them to, local boards eventually will have

♦,o start calling up 19-vear-olds.
j "But," he added, "there are no im
mediate prospects of this."
Under a directive from Selective
! Service headquarters, local boards
have not been going below the 20-
year-old bracket in filling quotas.
The October call was an increase
of 17.000 men over the September I
quota but fell nearly 7,000 below
the monthly average the Army fig
j ures will be necessary to meet its j
! manpower goals.
California will draft 3.200 men to
| fulfill the quota for October, Col.
Charles Going said today in Sacra
mento. There still is sufficient rnan
! power to alleviate the need of draft
j ing 19-year-olds in October, Going j
| said. The predicted 3,200-man draft I
[ for October will be less than the
4,000 men per month peak reached i
in February and March of this year, j
he said.
