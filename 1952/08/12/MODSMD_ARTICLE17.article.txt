# Notes About the Nation Husbands' Draft
## 
### 
Selective Service Director Lewis B. Hershey gingerly laid an
other brick on the draft system Tower of Babel last week when he
said in the monthly publication Selective Service that it ultimately
may be necessary to call draft age fathers to meet military man
power goals; that there are no present plans for ending depend
ency deferments; but that a review of them is of "utmost impor
tance" because of sharply heavier draft calls starting next October.
It seems to us that this is the latest in a long series of first pessi
mistic then optimistic statements issued by Hershey and Secretary
of Defense Anna Rosenberg intended to test public reaction before
they make concrete plans on the draft.
The resulting vacillating draft situation has caused much con
cern and worry, and not a little despair and frustration among all
men of draft age, married and single, in school and out of school.
It seems further that the time has long past when this situation
should cease to exst. If we in the draft age brackets and entering
them are the future of the nation as we are so often told, our path
toward providing that future should not be so needlessly ham
pered and harrassed.
Despite the bev/ailings of vote-minded congressmen and over
indulgent mothers seeking to shelter their "helpless" 20-year-old
sons, the foreseeable future of our country is such that military
manpower planners could set up a positive and definite plan based
upon answers to the following guestions:
A: What will be our continuing manpower needs in the event
of war? In the event of continuing armed peace?
B: What is the total manpower supply available to fill these
needs?
C: How much service will be demanded from each man to fill
the military needs and the requirements for military training?
D: The question of particular import to us at Stanford, when
shall we require our men to provide their military service to their
country —before or after they have completed their schooling—
and what kind of schooling?
Any program will obviously result in sacrifices to be made by
the youth of the nation. This is only right when the country needs
our sacrifices.
What it will also do, and what there is a dire need for it to do, is
to offer something definite around which the youth of the country
can plan their adult lives. This is the critical lack of the present
draft situation.
We, the youth, can base our plans on the present program of ifs,
ands, buts, and maybes for only so long. There is a limit to the
length of time we can live a day-to-day, hand-to-mouth existence
without the result being a long-term vacuum in our lives and dis
aster for the nation.
