As the presidential campaign begins to gather a bit of steam,
:he mud-slinging has already started, at least from one quarter.
The Republicans have sputtered a couple of times, trying to pin
the label of "Leftist" on Gov. Stevenson.
Their latest attempt holds no water whatsoever. A retired deco
rated Navy admiral implied last week that Stevenson was in a
iarge way to blame for blocking the attempt of a House committee
lo keep Communist radio operators off American merchant ships
curing World War 11, while he was assistant to Secretary of the
Navy Frank Knox.
Whatever is our atitude toward Russia now and however clear
Dur hindsight on mistaken dealings with the Reds in World War 11,
it remains that they were a military ally then. Any sincere attempt
to act with them to increase our military effectiveness then must
not attach a stigma to a person or his actions now.
