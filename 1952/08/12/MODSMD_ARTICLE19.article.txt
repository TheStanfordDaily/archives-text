# Foot in Mouth

President Truman did it again last week when he sought to pass
:>ut a little balm to Veep Barkley for missing the Demo presidential
nomination. Truman, in effect, said he was going to support Bark
ley until the latter withdrew.
If this statement had been made by the President without knowl
edge of the conditions of Barkley's forced withdrawal, it would
have been a grand gesture; but to assume that would be to assume
great naivete on the part of the president.
And, as in the Navy, you don't assume one thing in politics. As
a result, the woids put Harry s foot right back in his mouth where
it has been so often in the cast several years. â€”7im Madison
