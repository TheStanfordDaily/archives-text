## New Anthology Of British Prose 
### 
An anthology of English litera
i ture entitled "Prose of the English
| Renaissance," largely the work of
' two Stanford professors, has just
been published by Appleton-Ccn-
I tury-Crofts.
It includes selections from the
j prose works of more than 40 Eng
| lish writers of the sixteenth and
| seventeenth centuries. Elizabethan
j spelling and punctuation have been
j modernized, and background infor-
I mation is provided in the introduc-
I tion and notes.
The book was originally planned
jby the late Stanford English pro
! fesvor, Hoyt H. Hudson, and the
late Professor J. William Hebel of
! Cornell University as a companion
: volume to their "Poetry of the Eng
lish Renaissance."
After Professor Hudson's death in
1944, Professor Francis R. Johnson
! of the Stanford English Department
took over the entire work, editing
and supplying critical and biograph
! ical introductions and explanatory
; notes.
