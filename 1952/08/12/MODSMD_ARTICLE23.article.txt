Baseball Facts & Figures
Picked up the Wall Street Journal the other day and was quite taken
back by the facts and figures it presented. We happened to catch an issue
when the decline in baseball attendance was up for discussion.
The National League is running about 13 per cent below attendance
figures of last year; the American loop is about par for the course. Minor
.leagues are off about 10 per cent. All of which proves nothing, except to
convince the unsuspecting that Mr. Average American has decreased his
.sports spending dollar. However, such is not the case. Just listen to this:
It seems that wrestling, which before the war was almost non-existent,
today draws close to 13 million admissions a year across this country of
ours. Auto racing last year took in 16 per cent more at the box offices
than did all the baseball games put together over the six-month season
in the entire United States.
TV Not Death knell
There are two things that baseball owners are now almost sure of.
One is that television, at first feared as the death of all admissions, is
not the cause of this drop; and second, that the league leaders are not
always the teams that get the largest audiences or who never suffer set
backs.
This year the Yankees are suffering a 20 per cent attendance drop while
the Dodgers are going through the pangs of a 5 per cent dip. Meanwhile
Detroit, wallowing in last place in the American League, is boasting an
attendance rise of 4 per cent while the Browns under showman Bill Veeck
are having a tremendous year at the turnstiles with a sharp 80 per cent
increase over last year's sparse crowds.
Sports Dollar Spread Wider
And what is the explanation of all this? Ifc seems that the sports dollar,
although having increased since before the war, is being more widely
spread over a vast array of sports many of which have recently been
brought to the public's attention by one medium or another.
And what do baseball executives plan to do about it all? Some are
going in for promotional stunts of one sort or another. Others are sticking

| to the old thought that fans will
come to see a winner and are doing
all possible to build strong teams.
And what do we think of all this?
Well, with the baseball world still
j taking in 45 million at the gate, the
! worst that can happen is that bonus
j babies might have to settle for a tit
j under a hundred thousand to play
[ ball. We think baseball will survive.

Detroit, wallowing in last place in the American League, is boasting an
attendance rise of 4 per cent while the Browns under showman Bill Veeck
are having a tremendous year at the turnstiles with a sharp 80 per cent
increase over last year's sparse crowds.
Sports Dollar Spread Wider
And what is the explanation of all this? Ifc seems that the sports dollar,
although having increased since before the war, is being more widely
spread over a vast array of sports many of which have recently been
brought to the public's attention by one medium or another.
And what do baseball executives plan to do about it all? Some are
going in for promotional stunts of one sort or another. Others are sticking

| to the old thought that fans will
come to see a winner and are doing
all possible to build strong teams.
And what do we think of all this?
Well, with the baseball world still
j taking in 45 million at the gate, the
! worst that can happen is that bonus
j babies might have to settle for a tit
j under a hundred thousand to play
[ ball. We think baseball will survive.
Baseball Facts & Figures
Picked up the Wall Street Journal the other day and was quite taken
back by the facts and figures it presented. We happened to catch an issue
when the decline in baseball attendance was up for discussion.
The National League is running about 13 per cent below attendance
figures of last year; the American loop is about par for the course. Minor
.leagues are off about 10 per cent. All of which proves nothing, except to
convince the unsuspecting that Mr. Average American has decreased his
.sports spending dollar. However, such is not the case. Just listen to this:
It seems that wrestling, which before the war was almost non-existent,
today draws close to 13 million admissions a year across this country of
ours. Auto racing last year took in 16 per cent more at the box offices
than did all the baseball games put together over the six-month season
in the entire United States.
TV Not Death knell
There are two things that baseball owners are now almost sure of.
One is that television, at first feared as the death of all admissions, is
not the cause of this drop; and second, that the league leaders are not
always the teams that get the largest audiences or who never suffer set
backs.
This year the Yankees are suffering a 20 per cent attendance drop while
the Dodgers are going through the pangs of a 5 per cent dip. Meanwhile
Detroit, wallowing in last place in the American League, is boasting an
attendance rise of 4 per cent while the Browns under showman Bill Veeck
are having a tremendous year at the turnstiles with a sharp 80 per cent
increase over last year's sparse crowds.
