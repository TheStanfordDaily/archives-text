# Hickman Quits

NEW HAVEN. Conn. â€” Herman
Hickman, the jovial and rotund
Tennesseean who had a "lifetime"
job as Yale football coach, quit to
day to enter private business.
Hickman will join the staff of the
General Cigar Company, but will
remain on the Yale staff as a "con
sultant and scout." Hickman's suc
cessor will be announced tomorrow.
Only last year his three-year con
tract was ripped up in favor oi a
10-year pact, and many Yale men
said the 10-year period was a mere
technicality.
But today Hickman announced
his decision to give up football
"after a tremendous amount of de
liberation."
