# AT THE HISTORY CONFERENCE
## Teachers Informed They Have Chance to Teach Americanism 
### 
Tlie teacher of United States his
tory may not ignore facts or avoid
istues simply because someone
might draw implications i'rom what
he says.
And he has an obligation and an
unusual opportunity, in these days
of national and international ten
sion, to help students achieve :.f
-fi r r a a t iv e Americanism.
These were among the conclu
sions of 25 teachers, admini.-trators,
scholars, publicist . i nd laymen who
met here recently for the Institute
of American Histovj Workshop.
The week - long workshop ex
plored '"historical bases of Ameri
canism" under the au.-pices of the
Institute of American History and
was led by Stanford Professor Ed
gar E. Robinson, Institute director.
"Uncertainty of the world situ
ation toda,\ has sharpened the de
mand of legislators, school author
ities. and tjje general public for
the development of responsible
citizenship," says the workshop
report. "Much of this demand
centers on teachers of United
States history."
Furthermore, the teacher's diffi
culty in dealing with controversial

! issues varies with the local situation
: and the extent of administrative
support, i's well as with his ability
and the adequacy of his professional
training,
"The teacher does a disservice to
the community if. in the name o:
patriotism, he fails to note the mis
takes into which we are led by ex v.i
berant manifestations of our virtues.
The report cites five examples:
1. Our emphasis on rights and
the need for maintaining freedom
sometimes leads to forgetting that
the citizen also has duties.
2. Our zeal sometimes leads u>
to enact refonns without adequate j
public support. Thus we earn a
reputation for lawlessness despite
our acceptance of the concept of
the law's supremacy.
The opportunities America
affords for st.i mounting class bar
ritvs may ciuis" an exaggerated
pre - tige to be attached to a white
collar job—even to the individ
ual's financial detriment.
4. National exuberance often
becomes braggadocio, irritatirvj to
[ foreigners.
5. Eagerness for progress tends
toward individual and national !

wastefulness, the habit of tearing
down structures and rebuilding
rather than salvaging, and the de
pletion of our natural resources.
It is important, when comparing
American values with those of oth

|er countries, that one should pair
ideals with ideals and practices with
practices and not make the mistake
|of comparing American practices
