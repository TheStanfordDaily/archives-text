WASHINGTON, Aug. 14 (UP) — President Truman said today
that Dwight D. Eisenhower was offered top-secret reports on world
affairs a week or 10 days ago, but Gen. Omar Bradley later an
nounced he did not relay the offer to the Republican presidential
nominee.
"Being unfamiliar with political matters," Bradley said in a state-

■ment tonight," it never occurred to
me that the timing of notification
might become an issue, or I would
have gotten in touch with Eisen
hower immediately after my con
vex-sation with the President."
Bradley, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said Truman asked
him last Thursday to see that Ei
senhower got the information "and
asked me to get in touch with Ei
senhower."
In rejecting, earlier today, an in
vitation to a White House briefing
and luncheon Eisenhower noted that
the bid was sent to him after last
Thursday's briefing for Gov. Adlai
Stevenson, the Presidential nomi
nee.
Bradley said he and Truman dis
cussed that Eisenhower "recently
had been on active duty and was
acquainted with many of the mat
ters involved. This indicated there
was no immediate need to take this
up with Eisenhower," he said.
