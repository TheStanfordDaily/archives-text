# 'Operation Victory'
## 
### 
SPRINGFIELD, 111. â€” Gov. Adlai
E. Stevenson launched what he
called '"operation victory" to take
him to Washington today, urging
states to stop the "tidal drift'' of
government services to the national
capital.
The Democratic Presidential nom
inee also contrasted his experience
jn state government with the mili
tary career of Dwight D. Eisenhow
er, the Republican nominee. He
did not name Eisenhower but he
said republican government is based
on consent, not command.
And he ridiculed GOP charges
that he is a "captive" of various
groups. Stevenson said he seemed
to be the captive of almost every
one "except the Republican Old
I Guard."
j Stevenson followed these lines of
I defense and attack in his first formal
speech since his address accepting
the Presidential nomination at the
Democratic national convention
three weeks ago.
