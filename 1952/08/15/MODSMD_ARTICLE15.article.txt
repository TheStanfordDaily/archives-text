# OUTSIDE STANFORD
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
I should like to announce to Mr. and Mrs. North and South America
and all the ships at sea that the sandwich is quite a thing in Copenhagen,
the lovely capital of Denmark.
lae Dane has elevated the lowly sandwich to a lovely pedestal. What
a Sunday double-header at Ebbetts Field is to the occupant of Flatbush,
so the sandwich is to the people of Denmark.
Take, for example, a restaurant called Oskar Davidson's. A person sits
down in Oskar Davidson's and a waiter, usually blond, hands you what

looks like an unraveled roll of toilet paper with print
ing on it. This is Oskar Davidson's world-renowned
sandwich list. One can take the Stanford entrance
test, run three laps around the track, and polish off
ten cups of Cellar coffee in the same time it takes to
read Mr. Davidson's sandwich menu.
There is a choice of 177 Dagwoor's, with such exotic
creations as "one-half a young pigeon with stewed
mushrooms" and "six split crawfish tails." A Danish
sandwich is a whole meal on a piece of bread, and
that's just what they use . . . one piece of bread.
And never let a Dane see you picking up the

sandwich in your hands. You must use your fork and knife. Horrors,
picking up the sandwich in your hands is the same type of manners to
a Dane as a Stanford rough going to a rushing party at the Deke housa
and then spitting in the rushing chairman's face when he leaves.

Holland is every bit as beautiful as Denmark, although it's a different
type of beauty. And they actually do wear wooden shoes in Holland!
I have only one thing against Holland, and that is the language. The
Germans have a joke about the Dutch language. They say it is not a
language, it is a sickness of the throat. This is quite something coming
from the Germans, who often sound sick around the voice box themselves.
But even the guttural German language sounds like the sweet cooings of
Charles Boyer in comparison to the Dutch tongue.
Take the "g," for example. The Hollander starts out with something
th it might resemble our "g." But, alas, it never gets a chance to reach
the surface. He gargles it, spins it around in his mouth a few times, and
ends up with something that sounds like a hissing cobra.
But the "g" is relatively harmless. With some of the other letters,
you have to stand back.
Because everything within a radius of ten feet is sprayed.
