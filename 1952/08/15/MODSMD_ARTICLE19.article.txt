# Hobson Tells Of Science In Italy, Austria
## 
### 
High-grade and extensive scien
tific activity in postwar Italy and
Austria is reported by members of
an OEEC mission that returned to
the United States this week after
six weeks and one thousand miles
of travel in those two Marshall Plan
countries.
Upon his return to Palo Alto yes
terday after four weeks with the
team. Dr. J. E. liobson, director of
Stanford Research Institute and
chief of the mission, said:
"We found excellent laboratories
and very able scientists in Italian
universities, polytechnics, and re
search institutes in particular. But
financial support is extremely lim
ited.
"The shortage of research per
sonnel and facilities in the United
States—created largely by acceler
ated research activity for national
defense — may cause increasing
numbers of American companies to
consider offshore procurement of
research assistance from centers
such as we have seen in Italy and
Austria. In countries where raw
materials and natural resources are
limited, scientific brains and skills
still represent an important factor."
The mission, which was organized
by Stanford Research Institute for
the OEEC, met with more than 750
government officials, business exec
utives, educators, and scientists
during its visits to the principal in
dustrial cities of the two countries.
Investigated were the organiza
tion, financial support, administra
tion policies, and personnel of the
leading research facilities.
Dr. Hobson said special attention
was given industries which could,
with existing resources, be stimu
lated through scientific research to
enhance national economy and se
curity.
