# Tuesday Series Chorale Program Is 'Ambitious'
## 
### 
Harold C. Schmidt and the Stan
ford Chorale gave an ambitious pro
gram of contemporary choral music
at the Tuesday Evening Series this
week. Composers represented were
Vaughn Williams, Bacon, Ravel,
Hindemith, Martinu, Stanford's Bar
ney Childs, and Igor Stravinsky.
The soloists, especially Dorothy
Kupke and Leonard Weeks, carried
the Stravinsky Mass to a moder
ately happy conclusion. The chorus
faltered at times, and Professor
Schmidt maintained the dynamics
generally well above the mezzo
forte limit set by the composer. The
brass ensemble was good, keeping
.itself for the most part properly
subdued.
The two folk songs arranged by
Randall Thompson and Gustav Hoist
and tlie three Czech madrigals were
the most listenable pieces on the
program. Unfortunately, the per
formance was marred by overloud,
strained singing, poor co-ordination
of enunciation, and bad balance, so
that the interplay of the parts was
largely lost.
Something seemed to go wrong
with Childs' "Praeludium," which,
in spots, showed some pleasing
chordal structure. In this piece, one
could make out the words by listen
ing to Professor Schmidt, whose
enunciation is excellent.
