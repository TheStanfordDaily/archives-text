## OUTSIDE STANFORD Travel Folders Don't Tell All 
### 
The travel guides advise the visitor to Germany of the beautiful Rhein
and, the Bavarian lakes, etc. But as usual, what the travel folders don't
,;-.'.v about Germany is most of what there is to be said.
I am not belittling the majesty of the German countryside. The quaint
uwns and castles along the Rhein are matchless, and the medieval vil
lages of Rottenburg and Dinklesbuhl are enough to send a history major
ntu headspins.
Vhat I should like to point out is that the sharpest impression a neo
uhyte traveler receives is how destructive war is. This is certainly not a
ofound impression, but it is utterly poignant and sobering.
Germany has made a miraculous recovery since the end of the war,
>ut still a good per cent of all the cities lie in ruin. What once were
.tatcly churches, line buildings, and historic monuments are now twisted
Ueel. shattered bricks, and dust.
I went to Dachau today. The travel folders say nothing about Dachau.
,-'though it was un all the newscasters' tongues several years ago. Dachau,
vou may remember, was a Nazi concentration camp during the war. It's
iuiet at Dachau now, but if you get off the beaten path you can go there
-ncl see the gas chamber ... a low-ceilinged room with four concrete
».ulls and two steel doors. About 1G openings, of various sizes, emitted the
,g:»S i.nat snufied out thousands of lives.
'n the room next to the gas chamber are several ovens. These were
iseri for cremation.
One can see the war in people's faces, too. Young men and women
ilook old beyond their years, and the legless, armless, and blind are not
uncommon.
One also gets the strong impression that the German people want to
vdeem themselves in the eyes of the world. Dr. Theodcr Willemsen. an
l elderly and respected minister, told me, "Hie Allies made a mistake in
presuming that all Germans thought the way the Nazis cid. Most of
ny friends, including many German armv officers, hated Hitler. Now
J very few, even the former Nazi diehards, regard Hitler as anything hilt
i madman." Dr. Willemsen, incidentally, tallied against Hitler from the
uilpit, hut was "advised" by the Gestapo to quit it.
Yesterday, I picked up a hitch-hiker on the Autobahn. He was a
pleasant fellow in his late 20's. He had been a Nazi soldier. He told me,
.And I am sure he was sincere, "We were never told what was really
.happening. We were always warned that we must fight in defense ot the
fatherland. It was not a happy day for me when the war was over, and
,{ learned of the atrocities that many of my countrymen committed."
hese impressions have not been organized. They were not meant to be.
You don't organize things that hit you right in the face into handy little
compartments. You just look at the ruins of buildings and the ruins ot
people, standing in negative tribute to a monster named Hitler.
No, the travel folders don't tell all.
