defending champion Billy Maxwell

Hiskey stole the spotlight with his
triumphâ€”which even he had to ad
mit wasn't fashioned with good golf.
"But with the luck I 4iad, I
| couldn't lose," he said. "Why I hit
j trees three times with my drives
and each time the ball bounced back
onto the fairways. And how many
I times do you sink a 25-foot putt on
| one hole and follow it with a 35-
| footer that goes in on the verv next
hole?"

| greenskeeper, is a willowy lad
standing 6 feet 1 inch and weighing
175 pounds. He won the NICA (for
