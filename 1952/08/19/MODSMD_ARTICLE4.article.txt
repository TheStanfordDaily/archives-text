# THE 						CAMPAIGN
## Harry Truman To Give Talks In Key Areas 
### 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 18 (UP) —
President Truman will skip his
cherished whistle-stop tour this- fall
in-favor of a '"trouble-shooter" role
in which he will make single
speeches in critical Democratic j
areas, party strategists said today.
They said this was one of the de
cisions reached by Gov. Adlai E.
Stevenson of Illinois, the Demo
cratic Presidential nominee, and his i
high command at a weekend con
fere nee at Springfield.
Informants said the decision had
the "complete agreement" of Tru
man, who repeatedly has likened
himself to a private in the rear
ranks who stands ready to take
orders from Stevenson.
The decision to minimize Tru
man's campaign role somewhat, it
was said, was dictated by the ne
cessity of bringing Stevenson "into
everyone's living room" as well as
because of the Governor's deter
mination to run his own cam
paign.
These sources said they referred
to the necessity for "selling" Ste- |
venson to the country. They said |
he was almost unknown nationally [
until recently while his GCP op- j
ponent, Dwight D. Eisenhower, has j
been in the public eye for years.
Another factor in the decision to ;
limit Truman's campaign role was j
said to be the harsh reality of the j
high cost of campaigning. With
high - cost television scheduled to
play a major role, it was deemed
impossible to arrange full - scale
campaigns by both Stevenson and
Truman.
It was emphasized that the Pres
ident still will play a powerful
p;..t in the campaign. Party strat
egists said he could he an ex
' tremely effective campaigner in
single speeches in such metropoli
tan centers as New York, Chicago,
and Detroit.
Prior to thp Democratic conven
tion, Truman talked enthusiastically
of stumping the country on a "give
'em hell" basis for the Democratic
nominee. Since Stevenson's selec
tion he has confined himself to say
ing he will do whatever the Gover
nor wants.

ponent, Dwight D. Eisenhower, has j
been in the public eye for years.
Another factor in the decision to ;
limit Truman's campaign role was j
said to be the harsh reality of the j
high cost of campaigning. With
high - cost television scheduled to
play a major role, it was deemed
impossible to arrange full - scale
campaigns by both Stevenson and
Truman.
It was emphasized that the Pres
ident still will play a powerful
p;..t in the campaign. Party strat
egists said he could he an ex
' tremely effective campaigner in
single speeches in such metropoli
tan centers as New York, Chicago,
and Detroit.
Prior to thp Democratic conven
tion, Truman talked enthusiastically
of stumping the country on a "give
'em hell" basis for the Democratic
nominee. Since Stevenson's selec
tion he has confined himself to say
ing he will do whatever the Gover
nor wants.
