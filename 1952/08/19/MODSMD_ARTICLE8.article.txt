# Churchill Calls Extra Session About Iran

### 
LONDON, Aug. 13 (UP)â€”Anglo-
American differences over what to
do about Iran today caused Prime
Minister Winston Churchill to call
a special cabinet meeting for next
Wednesday.
Churchill was understood to have
bowed to American pressure for
fast action on the Iranian crisis.
The cabinet discussion of the prob
lem will be the second since Parlia
ment recessed two weeks ago.
Britain and America share anxi
ety that the crisis might get out of
hand and lead to a Communist coup
in Iran, officials of both countries
have made plain.
And they are pgreed that some
thing drastic must be done to as
sure a stable and independent
Iran friendly to the West. But
they differ on how to go about it.
The differences delayed Brit
ain's action on an offer by Pre
mier Mohammed Mossadegh to
renew negotiations on the Anglo-
Iranian oil dispute. That is the
core of the problem.
A Foreign Office spokesman said
today that Britain is reluctant to
negotiate with Mossadegh under al
leged pressure and threats. Ex
changes in Tehran over the week
end were said to have been unsatis
factory.
Diplomats here said Mossadegh
differences, and had begun to ex
was aware of the Anglo-American
ploit them to his advantage. Some
quarters have represented the dif
ferences as originating from a
Washington belief that Mossadegh is
the only sure barrier against a
Communist coup.
