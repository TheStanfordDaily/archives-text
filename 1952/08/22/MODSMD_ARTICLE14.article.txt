An American in Paris
Picture, if you will, the exquisite portrayal of Paris in the movie
'American in Paris." Have you got it? Okay, then forget it, beeausc
Paris isn't really like that. It's better.
Truly, Paris is more than a city. It's a state of mind. It's more than
churches, monuments, art galleries, and sidewalk cafes. It houses that
zany, fast-talking, lovable species of people known as the Parisian. To
"he Parisian, Paris IS France.
Let it be said that the streets of Paris accommodate the weirdest con
glomeration of traffic imaginable. First, you have the "Autobuses," the

taxis, the big cars, and small cars, all of which are
constantly beeping their squeaky horns. And all of
which are constantly sending pedestrians wing-foot
ing it to the sidewalks. Alter being in Paris for only
a week I feel like a fugitive from the law of averages
every time I cross a street.
But that's only half of the Paris traffic. French
men have more bicycles than they have cars, and
' it's not at all unusual t«» see a family of three on a
one-seat hike . . . the father pedaling, the mother
giving the arm signals, and the kid hanging on for
dear life. Motorscooters and motorbikes are plenti-

ful, too, and one often sees a white-bearded man in a beret on a motor
cycle, towing a little cart »vith his five-year-old grandson in ifc Then
there are the oddities, such as motorized wheelchairs waterbugging their
way through the stream of traffic.
Rut Paris is more than bicycles and cars. It's a pleasant stroll down
r he Champs Elysees on a sunny Sunday morning. A Sunday walk down
the fashionable Champs Elysees is to the Parisian what a double-header j
at Yankee Stadium is to the American.
Paris is also cafe-sitting. A Frenchman never rushes, and he has the 1
art of living down pat. He'll sit two hours at a cafe with his bottle of !
'vin," meditate, and watch the world go by.
Paris is browsing through the picturesque bookstalls that line the I
banks of the Seine. The story of Paris is also the story of numerous
couples, young and old. ho'cing hands as they walk down the narrow,
crooked streets of the Montmartve.
And, of course, Paris is an ensemble of monuments, one more im
oressive than the other . . . the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe,
♦he Bastille.
Hut the story of Paris is not all gaiety. It's also the story of people
3ike M. Renier and Anne Talmud. M. Renier's son was taken prisoner j
bv the Germans in 194 U. He never saw him again.
\nne is an attractive, highly likeable girl of 26. When the Germans i
Aere in occupation of France, she went home one evening, found the |
ihouse pillaged of everything, and was told that her mother had been ]
teken away. She never saw her mother aagin. Anne was Jewish and
was warned that the Germans were after her, too, and that she should I
|et nut of Paris.
Now. Anne is married and has a good job in a perfume shop. She j
f .ries to forget, but she never quite can. You don't forget things like that.
"here are many M. Reniers and Annes in Paris, and it has left its in
delible mark on the city.

Paris is browsing through the picturesque bookstalls that line the I
banks of the Seine. The story of Paris is also the story of numerous
couples, young and old. ho'cing hands as they walk down the narrow,
crooked streets of the Montmartve.
And, of course, Paris is an ensemble of monuments, one more im
oressive than the other . . . the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe,

Hut the story of Paris is not all gaiety. It's also the story of people
3ike M. Renier and Anne Talmud. M. Renier's son was taken prisoner j

was warned that the Germans were after her, too, and that she should I

An American in Paris
Picture, if you will, the exquisite portrayal of Paris in the movie
'American in Paris." Have you got it? Okay, then forget it, beeausc
Paris isn't really like that. It's better.
Truly, Paris is more than a city. It's a state of mind. It's more than
churches, monuments, art galleries, and sidewalk cafes. It houses that
zany, fast-talking, lovable species of people known as the Parisian. To
"he Parisian, Paris IS France.
Let it be said that the streets of Paris accommodate the weirdest con
glomeration of traffic imaginable. First, you have the "Autobuses," the

taxis, the big cars, and small cars, all of which are
constantly beeping their squeaky horns. And all of
which are constantly sending pedestrians wing-foot
ing it to the sidewalks. Alter being in Paris for only
a week I feel like a fugitive from the law of averages
every time I cross a street.
But that's only half of the Paris traffic. French
men have more bicycles than they have cars, and
' it's not at all unusual t«» see a family of three on a
one-seat hike . . . the father pedaling, the mother
giving the arm signals, and the kid hanging on for
dear life. Motorscooters and motorbikes are plenti-

ful, too, and one often sees a white-bearded man in a beret on a motor
cycle, towing a little cart »vith his five-year-old grandson in ifc Then
there are the oddities, such as motorized wheelchairs waterbugging their
way through the stream of traffic.
Rut Paris is more than bicycles and cars. It's a pleasant stroll down
r he Champs Elysees on a sunny Sunday morning. A Sunday walk down
the fashionable Champs Elysees is to the Parisian what a double-header j
at Yankee Stadium is to the American.
