To the Editor:
In vour issue of Friday, Aug. 15,
here appeared a review of the con
:ert of contemporary music pre
sented at the Tuesday Evening Se
ries bv the Stanford Chorale under
he direction of Harold C. Schmidt.
This "review" was injurious and in
sult.ir g both to the musicians and to
•he director.
i would like to quote here from
he review which appeared in the
■'alo Alto Times for Aug. 13: "Ev
erything could have been repeated
0 our pleasure. Schmidt not only
selects music that makes a program
1 musical experience, and arranges
his selections so they set each other
iff to the best advantage, but he
las a strong sense of differing styles.
This he imparts to his responsive
ihorus, so that each composer
stands on his own feet and there is
lone of the deadly sameness af
flicting choruses that go in for ef
fects and lose the music."
This rcvie.v was written by a
competent critic who is not in the
habit of giving undeserved praise
to Stanford musical productions.
The. critic's review has misrepre
sented. to the campus as a whole,
ii crtainiy worthwhile concert as
a complete failure, while throw
ing in a few persona! insults
which would have been out of

{.lace even if the concert had been
a failure.
The Daily's critic might also have
added that the "something," as he
so snidely put it, that "seemed to
go wrong" during the performance
of Barney Child's "Praeludium"
was an error in performance only,
and was not inherent in the com
position.
Those of us who have been col
lege journalists understand the dif
ficulties which deadlines and inade
quate staffs can present, particularly
during finals week. But this was
only one instance of an apparently
chronic failure on the part of The
Daily to provide competent and un
biased criticism of Stanford musi
cal events. Certainly if the local
movies deserve this attention, so do
Stanford vocal and instrumental
performances.
Many others with whom I have
talked agree with the general sen
timents I have expressed in this
letter. I am confident that they
would join me in a sincere request
to succeeding volumes of The Daily
that they take definite action toward
the development of a responsible
and intelligent policy regarding any
reviews future campus musical
