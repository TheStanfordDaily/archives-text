Pitcher Joe Chez, who signed with
i the Detrpi£ Tigers for an undis
closed bond's early in July, has been
finding the going tough since his
assignment, to last-place Williams
! port oi' fast Class A Eastern
League ~sjL
He in six games so
I far, winning none and losing three,
j A closer look at his record, how
ever, shows steady improvement.
In his first start he was knocked
for 13 hits-and 10 runs, but he went
the aistance to lose 10 to G.
In his second attempt he pitched

three no-hit, no-run frames, then
was jerked in the fourth after he
walked three straight men.
Heartbreaker
The third try was a real heart
breaker ... a 10-inning unearned
run 1 to 0 affair in which Chez
struck out five and walked two.
Joe tired again in his fourth start,
putting the first two men on base
in the ninth inning. He had a 4 to 2
lead at the time, but his relief
couldn't put out the fire and Wil
liamsport went on to lose 7 to 4.
Start number five proved loss
number four. Somewhat routine it
was, with Joe coughing up eight
hits and four runs to go down 4 to 1.
His only other appearance was
one inning of relief in which he re
tired the side three up, three down.
So he's about due to win.
The league roster reads like an
annex to the CIBA, featuring in
addition to Joe four players from
USC's champion club, including the
Charnofsky twins, Tom Lillis, and
Hal Killingsworth.
White Begins to Star
As football season gets into second
gear, a crew of recent ex-Cards
did pretty well with the San Fran
cisco 49ers last Sunday, as Buck
Shaw's boys routed Washington o5
to 0.
Bob White was one of the stars of
the game at halfback, and really
seems to be acting like a regular in
the start of his second year with
the 49ers. White played three years
here under Marchie Schwartz.

As football season gets into second
gear, a crew of recent ex-Cards
did pretty well with the San Fran
cisco 49ers last Sunday, as Buck
Shaw's boys routed Washington o5
to 0.
Bob White was one of the stars of
the game at halfback, and really
seems to be acting like a regular in
the start of his second year with
the 49ers. White played three years
here under Marchie Schwartz.
Pitcher Joe Chez, who signed with
i the Detrpi£ Tigers for an undis
closed bond's early in July, has been
finding the going tough since his
assignment, to last-place Williams
! port oi' fast Class A Eastern
League ~sjL
He in six games so
I far, winning none and losing three,
j A closer look at his record, how
ever, shows steady improvement.
In his first start he was knocked
for 13 hits-and 10 runs, but he went
the aistance to lose 10 to G.
In his second attempt he pitched

three no-hit, no-run frames, then
was jerked in the fourth after he
walked three straight men.
Heartbreaker
The third try was a real heart
breaker ... a 10-inning unearned
run 1 to 0 affair in which Chez
struck out five and walked two.
Joe tired again in his fourth start,
putting the first two men on base
in the ninth inning. He had a 4 to 2
lead at the time, but his relief
couldn't put out the fire and Wil
liamsport went on to lose 7 to 4.
Start number five proved loss
number four. Somewhat routine it
was, with Joe coughing up eight
hits and four runs to go down 4 to 1.
His only other appearance was
one inning of relief in which he re
tired the side three up, three down.
So he's about due to win.
The league roster reads like an
annex to the CIBA, featuring in
addition to Joe four players from
USC's champion club, including the
Charnofsky twins, Tom Lillis, and
Hal Killingsworth.
