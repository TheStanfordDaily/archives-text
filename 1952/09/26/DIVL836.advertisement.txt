Well, it's just our way of saying "Hello, Stanforciite, glad to have
you with us." You are in pretty good company down there on the
Farm and you are going to be kind of busy for a few years. But,
if ever you need a pair of sox, or pants, or a jacket, or you just want
to relax for a few moments . . . why, come in and browse around.
We've listed below just a few of the i terns we carry, but if you want
to know more about us you might ask some upper classmen . . .
we're old friends.

Hi, Frosh! Have a Browse!
That's a strange line, isn't it? . . . have a browse?
Well, it's just our way of saying "Hello, Stanforciite, glad to have
you with us." You are in pretty good company down there on the
Farm and you are going to be kind of busy for a few years. But,
if ever you need a pair of sox, or pants, or a jacket, or you just want
to relax for a few moments . . . why, come in and browse around.
We've listed below just a few of the i terns we carry, but if you want
to know more about us you might ask some upper classmen . . .
we're old friends.
