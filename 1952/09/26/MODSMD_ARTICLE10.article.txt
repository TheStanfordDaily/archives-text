# Injuns Seek Second Win Against Once-Beaten WSC
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
"Cffense" will be the word tomorrow as Chuck Taylor's Indians
travel to Pullman to open their 1952 Pacific Coast Conference play
. against a Washington State powerhouse.
The Cougars, who averaged four touchdowns and nearly 400
yards per game last season, had their Rote Bowl hopes severely

eliminated. Unfortunately for WSC
fans, the Cougars play oniy three
games at home this year, the other
two against Idaho and Oregon State,
both not in the running this year.
Manoogian Out
Much of Stanford's hopes were
shattered this week when offensive
guard Norm Manoogian was de
clared out for the season. The 204-
pound senior was heavily counted
on before a torn cartilage was suf
fered in practice.
Aside from Manoogian, the news
this week from the Stanford camp
has been good. A 1 Kirkland, out
last week with a puller! muscle, is
bark in action and v/ill play tomor
row. Only injury is to safetyman
Dave Eld ridge, who with a bruised
rib will not make the trip.
John Steinberg and Sam Morley
will start, in the end positions, with
Carter Pyle and Jim Vick in the
tackle slots. Phil Wilson will take
Manoogian's place at one guard post,
with Len Mayrhofer at the other.
Jerry Goldberg is the starting cen
ter.
Garrett Is QB
Bob Garrett is the Indians' quar
terback. Taylor and his assistants
were more than pleased with Gar
rett's performance last week. He
completed 10 out of 12 passes, and of

a 35-7 defeat to USC. However,

are a far better team than that score j.
indicates, and have to win this; one '
to stay in the running for the New |
Year's Day contest.
Stanford, on the other hand, is not j
eligible for the Bowl this year, j.
While the WSC team considers thi c ; j j
game the '"big one," to avenge last i (
year's 21-13 defeat, to keep in then
running for the championship, and <
to make a good impression in their j i
home opener, the Indians have few i
such reasons for inspired play. This !
game does not have the Rose Bowl j
at str.kc for them, they made an ex
cellent impression last week in do- !
feating Santa Cb ra. 28-13, and this
contest is only a buildup for Michi- I
gan next week. The only thing in
favor of Stanford is the fact thai
this is their only appearance out
side of California thb season, and a j
victory would be helpful to the !
national standings, not to mention |
a temporary first-place tie in the j
PCC. This is the only league action J
slated for this weekend.
Rogers Field, seating on:y 25,000, j
is to be the site of the game. It has j
been long sold out, for WSC fans ,
have caught that dread disea co
"Rose Bowlitis," and tickets will
continue to bo at a premium until <
the Cougars are mathematically '
