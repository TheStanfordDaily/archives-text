# Car Reg Set By Chief Davis
## 
### 
All persons who have cars on cam
pus for the first time or who have a
different car on campus from 1 >t
year should register them with the
Stanford Police Department at the
Corp Yard as soon as possible.
The registration, accomplished
without charge, is for the owners'
protection and convenience and re
sults in lower fines pairl for traffic
offenses.
Chief of Police Gordy Davis aid
yesterday that the parking problem
is likely to be more difficult this year
even than last.
Davis warned that the only solu
tion to the problem without a gre; I
deal of cost in parking fines is for
campus drivers to "be satisfied with
parking a couple of blocks away from
their destination and then walking.'
Davis added that a good habit is to
use your car for off campus business,
but walk or ride bicycles as much ,i
possible on campus.
