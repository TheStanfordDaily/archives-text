Your qualifications h;:vo been serutini/fd, several
little H'iitk-inen haw made a vi. il to your bank to
n.ake Min you have $220 in it. ;• 11cl you have been
duly accepted into the Stanford I ..mily.
Welcome to it.
hight about now, you are as tired a", a high school
rrnioi on the morning after grad ni'-ht of hearing
welcome speeches. So this seems

an appropriate time to examine
Come of the ci iticisms people
make of Stanford. You may
have heard dial:
I. 'I here is only one thing
worse than Cellar coflee and that
is poison.
A Stanford woman':: a two
face, arid Loth of them are ugly.
X That thl! Farm costs like
hr 11.
4. That our language require
/, uillK- '. rn m<'./!imrnl

meats are medieval.
That the only difference between Eneina and
tVii Sn .kepit is that there are no snakes in Eneina
(cvej since Doodles Weaver left).
Aipd that l'egi. tration line.: are : o long that if

you v/ant to buy an ice crcam 1...r, you have to do
it through CARE.
Now, in defense of my alma mater, I must say
that this is not altogether true. The ice cream bars
don't come through CARE at all.
A word of cheer to those of you who did I' ;
than well on your bonehead En dish te .1 . llerheil
Hoover flunked it twi.e, and look what became
of him.
* w *
Also, a word of advice. May it always be fortune
to see your today at Stanford with the eyes of
tomorrow. In other words, don't consider the Farm
as a four-year prolongation of high school social
activities, but rather as a momentous : lepping stone
to the future.
This doesn't mean bookwork and nothing else. It
means a comfortable mixture of work, social iunc
tions, sports, and activities. By all means, do take
advantage of the abundance of activities that exist
here. The publications always need new blood, and
likewise organizations like Kally Com, the Institute
of International Relations, and the religious juoups.
There are many more.
And so may you see your today at Stanford with
the eyes of tomorrow. See ya on Qu: d.
