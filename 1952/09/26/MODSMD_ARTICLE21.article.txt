To the Editor: \
Very recently attention lias been turned to
I.he subject of donatijntf one's eye- at death to an eye
lii.nk. The corneas ,yre then used in transplant oser
; lions to help -sonr |>ne gain si'jjht.
I at once set ahotlit to receive from my physician
(lJr. Kussel V. Le<i, nationally known heaH of Palo
Alto Clinic) wh .t ."information war required for this
pjoeedurc. 1 foujsid it to he very simple indeed. All
that is necessary i- to consult your dot-to:- who wdl
j'ive you the proper finn > to sign. If he does not
have them available he will direct you to the
nearest eye bai'ik. However, as 1 wished to have a
few personal 'uuertions answered I wrote to the
Stanford Eye Bank at 2'3')B Sacramento Street in
San Franei?c<. with the result that a very informa

tive and complete personal letter was received from
the secretary, Mrs. Frances Lloyd. I was very
pleased to have ail the details in my possession and
to be able to show them to anyone I thought would
be interested.
I find that this project being rather new is not
known to a great number of people and therefore
has net been given sufficient thought. So now, what
time is left f.r me (I am SO) 112 plan to devote to
this cause. My husband and I are registered eye
donors—we signed up immediately. Why not? Why
wouldn't anyone, old or young, of any nationality,
be willing to help the blind with no to: t at all and
no inconvenience to thcmselrnves?
It surely is worthy of consideration.
