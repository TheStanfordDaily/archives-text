# 'Full House' Gets Big Hand
## 
### RUBY BERNSTEIN DOROTHY DODGE 
The conglomeration of ijony,
rudcifSn twist endings, and rich
characterization which oro syn
or.ymous with "O. Hanry" have
L>een excellently transferred to
ihe screen in "Full House," now
playing at Ihe Park Theater.
The film reflect, two current Hol
lywood trends: tie short sto; y «ol
faction technique winch proved ::o
successful for Somerset Mau ham
and the practice of jamming a:
many stars as possible into one film
The five O. Henry stories included
in "Full House' each have their

own director and
co: 112 of : tar , an-.l
then foi e differ
widely in tone
and quality.
