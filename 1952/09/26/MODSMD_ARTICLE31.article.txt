# Welcome to the Class of '56
## 
### 
I like the looks of '56.
Thos2 of us who have been pre
paring for the new freshmen have
been wondering what they would be
like. This is always an interesting
subject of speculation.
Now the class is here—almost 1,200
strong. It measures up to our every
expectation. I am glad to add this
official word of welcome and good
wishes to the new freshmen. May
they make the most of the splendid
opportunities which are offered at
Stanford.

: Welcome, Class of '56' I welcome
1 this opportunity to greet you on
I behalf of the members of my staff
| as well as myself.
| For months we have been looking
| forward to your arrival on the
campus. Your credentials indicate
you are promising students, so we
are expecting great things of you.
You are starting a challenging
new life and will be faced with im
portant decisions to make. These
will require your most careful at
tention and thought and sometimes
the help of others. I hope you will
make use of the many splendid op
portunities at Stanford for such
help.
May I again say "welcome" and
add best wishes for a successful col
lege life?
