# POLIO OUTBREAK
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 (UP) —
A record 4,190 new cases of polio
were reported last week.

Greetings to the Class of '5(5! Each
year The Stanford Daily thought
fully gives me the opportunity to
welcome the freshman class through
its columns before the occasion pre
sents itself for me to greet you in
person.
This is the third year that I have

had this pleasure. The men .and
women whom I addressed in the fall
of 1949 are now seniors. I know
many of them personally, have
watched them reach roles of lead
ership both academically and in
student activities, and I will be
frank to say that my contact with
them, as it will be with you, is one
of the most stimulating and reward
ing phases of my work.
I wish you well as you follow in
their footsteps. You face an op
portunity that occurs but once in
your life and I hope you will not
let it slip by. For you., may count
on the fact that the University's
high standards, which make a Stan
ford degree a matter of pride, will
distinguish those content to follow
from those with initiative, and the
indifferent from those with serious
purpose. You are all, both men and
women, highly selected on the basis
of intelligence and potential ability.
You should do well if you put your
hearts and minds to it. But Stan
ford can offer you only the oppor
tunity; it is up to you to make the
most of it.
We hope you will all soon feel at
home at Stanford. My wife and I
are looking forward to meeting you
at the freshman reception which we
will hold at our home from 3:30 to
5 p.m. on Tuesday, Sept. 30.
