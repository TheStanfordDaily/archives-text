A.
Invitations to make application for
Fulbright Awards in three categories
have been extended to Stanford stu
dents and faculty for the academic
year of 1A53-54. All students and
faculty members who are interested
are urged to obtain application forms
and complete them as soon as pos
sible.
The first category is for seniors
who will graduate by June 1953.
Those making this type of applica
tion arc to he judged in a com
petitive grouping of undergradu
ates only. Hence the degree of
competition becomes less keen than
formerly. I! is hoped that many
seniors will avail themselves of
tiiis opportunity for a year of study
abroad.
The second category is for gradu
ate students who are working on an j
advanced degree or graduate pro- ;
gram. The year abroad can serve as j
a means to obtain thesis or disserta- [
tion data or simply to enhance one's
background. The applicant is judged
to a considerable extent upon a proj
ect or study program which he \
wishes to pursue.
The third category relates to
post-doctoral students and faculty i
who wish to lecture or to do ad
vanced research abroad. Experi
ence and scope of background are j
usually bases for selection of can
didates for these awards.
Past records indicated that stu
dents applying from Stanford Uni- |
versity do well when competing with j
applicants from other institutions, j
Last year one out of every four Stan- j
ford applicants received an award. \
Evidence indicates that this is a very '
favorable percentage when compared
to other institutions.
