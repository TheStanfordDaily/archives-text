# Strong Vocational Results Prove Valid After 19 Years
## 
### 
If you know a college freshman's score for engineering interest
in the Strong Vocational Interest Test, can you predict what his
occupation will be 19 years hence?
The answer is "Yes—with qualifications," says Dr. Edward K.
Strong Jr., noted psychologist and professor emeritus of Stanford
I University. ♦ —— i

Remarkable agreement is shown
! between freshmen's scores and their
1 choice of jobs in Dr. Strong's fol
! low-up study, results of which were
! published recently in the Journal of
1 Applied Psychology.
Dr. Strong tested 306 Stanford
University freshmen in 1930. Those
who became engineers had scored
1 09 per cent engineering interest.
i Another group who became physi
j cians scored only 48 per cent engi
neering interest. And those who be
i came lawyers scored a mere 16 per
cent.
What Is the Test?
The Strong Vocational Interest
! Test does not measure a man's abil
j ity to do a certain job. Rather it is
! a yardstick of how much he will
enjoy doing it. In selecting an oc
cupation, enjoyment of one's job is
just as important as having the abil
ity to do it, Dr. Strong points out.
The test consists of 400 questions
about occupations, school subjects,
amusements, activities, and pecul
iarities of people. Answers given by
the person tested are compared on
carefully worked - out scales with
the answers of persons already suc
cessfully engaged in a certain occu
pation. Similarity of answers shows
a similarity of interests, which in

I
turn indicates the person being
tested will like that occupation.
Interests Don't Change
Interests don't change much, ei
ther. Dr. Strong gave follow-up
tests in 1931, 1939, and 1949. He
found the interests cf his former
Stanford freshmen 91 per cent the
same after one year, 77 per cent the
same after nine years, and 76 per
I cent the same after 19 years. His !
results also seem to indicate that
j interests change most during the
j first nine years, not much j
during the first year.
Dr. Slrong notes, however, that i
psychological tests are far from in- i
fallible, and there are always ex
ceptions among those tested. Fur
thermore, many.factors that deter
mine a man's occupational choice
are independent of his interests,
such as health, ability, financial
condition, and family pressure.
Considering all this, Dr. Strong
says the agreement between engi
neer interest scores and choice of
occupation is far greater than he
expected. The study makes it clear
I that the higher a man's score in an
occupation, the greater the likeli- ,
i hood he will actually enter it.
