# Taylor Tells Indian Hopes, Chances for 1952 Season
## 
### CHUCK TAYLOR 
(Ed Note: Chuck Taylor's pre
season impression of his football
squad was originally printed in the
October Stanford Alumni Review.)
The coming football season prom
ises to be one oi' extreme interest to
us on the athletic staff and, I am sure,
to all those supporters of Stanford's
othletie activities for two reasons:
First, to see whether these boys
can equal the record of last year's
very fine squad, and second, to see
which of the new boys come through
to take the place of so many of the
fine boys who graduated last year.
We certainly are not looking for

any miracles but feel confident that
a number of men will be able to
step in and do very fine jobs in
positions where they probably had
played second or third string last
year. I believe you are going to hear
of many players who have not bten
on the roster before, or at least
played very little of the total play
ing time.
It is hard to figure what the sea
son will bring but I certainly hope
that we are able to present you with
a team that is of the caliber of last
year's fighting group—a team that
refuses to be beaten, and a team
composed of players of the highest
quality, of whom all Stanford people
can be proud.
Probably the two main losses from
last year's squad were Gary Ker
korian, a very fine quarterback, and
Bill McColl. To replace Kerkorian
we have Bobby Garrett, a junior who
played under Gary last year and got
in a certain amount of playing time
in various games and made a credit
able showing. I anticipate that Bob
Garrett will turn out to be a very
fine quarterback who will do as good
a job as his predecessor in all aspects
of the game.
As replacements of McColl there
are several boys — probably at the
top of the list is Sam Morley, who
has shown that he has very excellent
pass-receiving abilities. Closely fol
lowing Morley for receiving honors
should be John Steinberg, a big boy
from New Jersey who will bo a
junior next year. Also, ready to step
in, will be Bill Stori->n, veteran of
last year who will be playing at right
end this year and who has demon
strated his ability at the end spot for
the last two years.
From the offensive tackle stand
point we have approximately the
same men we had last year, with the
addition of one or two who, I know,
will help us, namely, Jim Vick at
the left tackle spot, Carter Pyle and
John Broderick at the light tackle
bpot, with newcomers John Stanton
and Win Wedge bolstering those po
sitions. It is very possible that Brod
erick will go to defense along with
Stanton, to round out a fairly strong

tackle contingent both offensively
and defensively.
We lost quite a number of our
guards last year, not including, how
ever, Norm ivianuogian wno woi nuve
helping him in that position such
boys as Len Mayrhofer, a transfer
from St. Mary's whose eligibility
comes into focus this year, and
sophomores Paul Revak and John
Roberg,
Our center spot from which we
lost everyone who played on the
squad last year, will be handled by
Jerry Goldberg, a sophomore, along
with Allen Manner, a senior, with
possible fill-ins by Dick Steere and
Manford Vanderlip, although these
boys at the present time are slated
for defensive work.
In the back field we are going to
have with us again Bob Mathias —
need 1 say more—at the fullback
spot, bolstered by Bill Charbonneau
and Dick Watson. At tha left half
spot will be veteran Ron Cook along
with a new power by the name of
Jimmy Stewart of Inglewood, Cali
fornia, a small boy but a very in
tense player. At the right half spot,
Skip Crist, Bill Rogers, Bill Heil
bron, all showing potential that I
think will be of value to us this
coming year.
All in all, from an offensive .stand
point, 1 believe we have the making
of a reasonably good team — how
good, will depend upon the spirit
that is developed, the desire to com
pete and to excel, that we find among
these boys. We feel that a team of
this nature is capable of winning
any game that it plays (if the right
amount of desire is present).

in various games and made a credit
able showing. I anticipate that Bob
Garrett will turn out to be a very
fine quarterback who will do as good
a job as his predecessor in all aspects
of the game.
As replacements of McColl there
are several boys — probably at the
top of the list is Sam Morley, who
has shown that he has very excellent
pass-receiving abilities. Closely fol
lowing Morley for receiving honors
should be John Steinberg, a big boy
from New Jersey who will bo a
junior next year. Also, ready to step
in, will be Bill Stori->n, veteran of
last year who will be playing at right
end this year and who has demon
strated his ability at the end spot for
the last two years.
From the offensive tackle stand
point we have approximately the
same men we had last year, with the
addition of one or two who, I know,
will help us, namely, Jim Vick at
the left tackle spot, Carter Pyle and
John Broderick at the light tackle
bpot, with newcomers John Stanton
and Win Wedge bolstering those po
sitions. It is very possible that Brod
erick will go to defense along with
Stanton, to round out a fairly strong

tackle contingent both offensively
and defensively.
We lost quite a number of our
guards last year, not including, how
ever, Norm ivianuogian wno woi nuve
helping him in that position such
boys as Len Mayrhofer, a transfer
from St. Mary's whose eligibility
comes into focus this year, and
sophomores Paul Revak and John
Roberg,
Our center spot from which we
lost everyone who played on the
squad last year, will be handled by
Jerry Goldberg, a sophomore, along
with Allen Manner, a senior, with
possible fill-ins by Dick Steere and
Manford Vanderlip, although these
boys at the present time are slated
for defensive work.
In the back field we are going to
have with us again Bob Mathias —
need 1 say more—at the fullback
spot, bolstered by Bill Charbonneau
and Dick Watson. At tha left half
spot will be veteran Ron Cook along
with a new power by the name of
Jimmy Stewart of Inglewood, Cali
fornia, a small boy but a very in
tense player. At the right half spot,
Skip Crist, Bill Rogers, Bill Heil
bron, all showing potential that I
think will be of value to us this
coming year.
All in all, from an offensive .stand
point, 1 believe we have the making
of a reasonably good team — how
good, will depend upon the spirit
that is developed, the desire to com
pete and to excel, that we find among
these boys. We feel that a team of
this nature is capable of winning
any game that it plays (if the right
amount of desire is present).
(Ed Note: Chuck Taylor's pre
season impression of his football
squad was originally printed in the
October Stanford Alumni Review.)
The coming football season prom
ises to be one oi' extreme interest to
us on the athletic staff and, I am sure,
to all those supporters of Stanford's
othletie activities for two reasons:
First, to see whether these boys
can equal the record of last year's
very fine squad, and second, to see
which of the new boys come through
to take the place of so many of the
fine boys who graduated last year.
We certainly are not looking for

any miracles but feel confident that
a number of men will be able to
step in and do very fine jobs in
positions where they probably had
played second or third string last
year. I believe you are going to hear
of many players who have not bten
on the roster before, or at least
played very little of the total play
ing time.
It is hard to figure what the sea
son will bring but I certainly hope
that we are able to present you with
a team that is of the caliber of last
year's fighting group—a team that
refuses to be beaten, and a team
composed of players of the highest
quality, of whom all Stanford people
can be proud.
Probably the two main losses from
last year's squad were Gary Ker
korian, a very fine quarterback, and
Bill McColl. To replace Kerkorian
we have Bobby Garrett, a junior who

lost everyone who played on the
squad last year, will be handled by
Jerry Goldberg, a sophomore, along
with Allen Manner, a senior, with
possible fill-ins by Dick Steere and
Manford Vanderlip, although these
boys at the present time are slated
for defensive work.
In the back field we are going to
have with us again Bob Mathias —
need 1 say more—at the fullback
spot, bolstered by Bill Charbonneau
and Dick Watson. At tha left half
spot will be veteran Ron Cook along
with a new power by the name of
Jimmy Stewart of Inglewood, Cali
fornia, a small boy but a very in
tense player. At the right half spot,
Skip Crist, Bill Rogers, Bill Heil
bron, all showing potential that I
think will be of value to us this
coming year.
All in all, from an offensive .stand
point, 1 believe we have the making
of a reasonably good team — how
good, will depend upon the spirit
that is developed, the desire to com
pete and to excel, that we find among
these boys. We feel that a team of
this nature is capable of winning
any game that it plays (if the right
amount of desire is present).
(Ed Note: Chuck Taylor's pre
season impression of his football
squad was originally printed in the
October Stanford Alumni Review.)
The coming football season prom
ises to be one oi' extreme interest to
us on the athletic staff and, I am sure,
to all those supporters of Stanford's
othletie activities for two reasons:
First, to see whether these boys
can equal the record of last year's
very fine squad, and second, to see
which of the new boys come through
to take the place of so many of the
fine boys who graduated last year.
We certainly are not looking for

any miracles but feel confident that
a number of men will be able to
step in and do very fine jobs in
positions where they probably had
played second or third string last
year. I believe you are going to hear
of many players who have not bten
on the roster before, or at least
played very little of the total play
ing time.
It is hard to figure what the sea
son will bring but I certainly hope
that we are able to present you with
a team that is of the caliber of last
year's fighting group—a team that
refuses to be beaten, and a team
composed of players of the highest
quality, of whom all Stanford people
can be proud.
Probably the two main losses from
last year's squad were Gary Ker
korian, a very fine quarterback, and
Bill McColl. To replace Kerkorian
we have Bobby Garrett, a junior who
played under Gary last year and got
in a certain amount of playing time
in various games and made a credit
able showing. I anticipate that Bob
Garrett will turn out to be a very
fine quarterback who will do as good
a job as his predecessor in all aspects
of the game.
As replacements of McColl there
are several boys — probably at the
top of the list is Sam Morley, who
has shown that he has very excellent
pass-receiving abilities. Closely fol
lowing Morley for receiving honors
should be John Steinberg, a big boy
from New Jersey who will bo a
junior next year. Also, ready to step
in, will be Bill Stori->n, veteran of
last year who will be playing at right
end this year and who has demon
strated his ability at the end spot for
the last two years.
From the offensive tackle stand
point we have approximately the
same men we had last year, with the
addition of one or two who, I know,
will help us, namely, Jim Vick at
the left tackle spot, Carter Pyle and
John Broderick at the light tackle
bpot, with newcomers John Stanton
and Win Wedge bolstering those po
sitions. It is very possible that Brod
erick will go to defense along with
Stanton, to round out a fairly strong

tackle contingent both offensively
and defensively.
We lost quite a number of our
guards last year, not including, how
ever, Norm ivianuogian wno woi nuve
helping him in that position such
boys as Len Mayrhofer, a transfer
from St. Mary's whose eligibility
comes into focus this year, and
sophomores Paul Revak and John
Roberg,
