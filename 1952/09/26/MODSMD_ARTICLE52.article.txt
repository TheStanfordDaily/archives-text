RON RAMBLES—Ron Cook moves for a short gain in last Sat
urday's season opener against Santa Clara. Fullback loe Mc-
Carger, star Bronco fullback moves in to make the tackle. The
Cards showed a well-rounded team as they ground out a 20 13
win over a highly-touted Santa Clara team.


BRONCO BUSTING--Dewey Falcone booms lur four yards before he is hit by Cards Ted Tan
ner, Bob Thompson, and Chuck Essegian. The Card defense looked tough last Saturday against
the Broncs. How it stands up against Washington Slate's potent air-ground attack tomorrow will
determine the result. —Photo by Roy Broun
