# Olympic Championships, Bob Bryan's Death Arc Principal Sports Stories of the Summer
##

Summer Daily Sports Editor
Stanford's sports this past summer
ran the complete gamut from un
heralded champions all the way to
tragic death.
The Cinderella winners were the
j Cards' pair - oared - with - coxswain
! crew -composed of Jim Fifer, Dew
joy Hecht, and Jim Beggs—who de
feated Navy by a scant margin of
j two feet to win the l ight to repre
! cut the United States in the Olym
j pic Games .
| Picked to win by us way back in
J May and ignored by Live rest of the
sporting press, the Cards thrilled
the nation and really proved the
strength of the privately financed
rowing program carried on at Stan
ford since the war.
Jim Beggs, an ex-Stanford coach
and Yale coxswain, coached and
coxed the pair-oar outfit and per
sonally footed the bill for most of
I the expenses.
The Cards wenl on to Helsinki
I where they won one race, hut were
then eliminated by two successive
| defeats. Heavy colds hampered the
j rower.s during their stay.
And then it was Bob Mathias who
i swept to his second straight Olym-
I pic decathlon championship which

virtually made him the world's
greatest athlete.
A highly touted Stanford Roll'
squad provided the disappointment
ot the summer. The Card linksmen
traveled back to Purdue for the
NCAA tourney, only to finish well
down the list of entrants with a (305
team score. Warren Duiley came
through the best individually as he
reached the quarter-finals of match
play.
In the Syracuse Regatta and at
the Olympic Trials, Stanford's eight
oared crew finished well out of the
running.
Following the end - of - school
splurge of tournaments, the summer
sports scene relaxed into easy golf,
volleyball, and beach fun.
Then late in July pitcher Joe
Chez followed Rog Osenbaugh into
professional baseball by signing
with the Detroit Tigers. Chez, as
signed to Williamsport of the East
ern League, finished the summer
with a 3.11 EKA. Playing with a
last-place team, however, his win
loss record came out a meager 2-(i.
Osenbaugh hail signed with the
PCL's Sacramento Solons and
pitched sometimes effective, some
times wild ball while appearing
mostly in relief roles.
Early August saw an outstanding
performance by a Stanford athlete
just intending to have some week
end fun.
Roy Defflebach of Ihe Summer
Excom thought up the idea for a
summer Hamburger Decathlon, run
ofl under regulation conditions, and

went around campus lining up men
to participate.
Among the entrants was Don
Sanders, freshman deefnsive half
back on last year's grid squad (he's
not out this year, because he failed
to make up an ineligibility). San
ders wont out onto the Angell Field
track and proceeded to sweep the
event, scoring 5,599 points under
the old system, a performance that
would have ranked about 15th in
the nation at the Tulare Olympic J
tryouts.
And then September brought i
tragedy. After being cut from the
San Francisco 49er squad along with
another Card tryoutee, Harry Ilu
gasian — Bobby Bryan was found
dead in bed one Sunday afternoon.
His death, attributed to lung con
gestion, brought to an abrupt close
the career of an outstanding Stan
ford track star and football player.
Although Bryan and Hugasian
failed to make the pro grade, others
didn't. Bob Meyers has survived
the final tquad cut and is now an
important cog in the 49ers' cham
pionship plans.
At Pittsburgh, Gary Kerkorian
has hung onto his job with the
Steelers, and seems destined to be
a competent passing QB in pro cir
cles. Cut from the Pitt squad, pos
sibly in place of Gary, was' Chuck
Qrtmann, All - American tailback
with Michigan in 1950.
And that about brings us around
to fall quarter. On with the football
season!

gasian — Bobby Bryan was found
dead in bed one Sunday afternoon.
His death, attributed to lung con
gestion, brought to an abrupt close
the career of an outstanding Stan
ford track star and football player.
Although Bryan and Hugasian
failed to make the pro grade, others
didn't. Bob Meyers has survived
the final tquad cut and is now an
important cog in the 49ers' cham
pionship plans.
At Pittsburgh, Gary Kerkorian
has hung onto his job with the
Steelers, and seems destined to be
a competent passing QB in pro cir
cles. Cut from the Pitt squad, pos
sibly in place of Gary, was' Chuck
Qrtmann, All - American tailback
with Michigan in 1950.
And that about brings us around
to fall quarter. On with the football
season!
Summer Daily Sports Editor
Stanford's sports this past summer
ran the complete gamut from un
heralded champions all the way to
tragic death.
The Cinderella winners were the
j Cards' pair - oared - with - coxswain
! crew -composed of Jim Fifer, Dew
joy Hecht, and Jim Beggs—who de
feated Navy by a scant margin of
j two feet to win the l ight to repre
! cut the United States in the Olym
j pic Games .
| Picked to win by us way back in
J May and ignored by Live rest of the
sporting press, the Cards thrilled
the nation and really proved the
strength of the privately financed
rowing program carried on at Stan
ford since the war.
Jim Beggs, an ex-Stanford coach
and Yale coxswain, coached and
coxed the pair-oar outfit and per
sonally footed the bill for most of
I the expenses.
The Cards wenl on to Helsinki
I where they won one race, hut were
then eliminated by two successive
| defeats. Heavy colds hampered the
j rower.s during their stay.
And then it was Bob Mathias who
i swept to his second straight Olym-
I pic decathlon championship which

virtually made him the world's
greatest athlete.
A highly touted Stanford Roll'
squad provided the disappointment
ot the summer. The Card linksmen
traveled back to Purdue for the
NCAA tourney, only to finish well
down the list of entrants with a (305
team score. Warren Duiley came
through the best individually as he
reached the quarter-finals of match
play.
In the Syracuse Regatta and at
the Olympic Trials, Stanford's eight
oared crew finished well out of the
running.
Following the end - of - school
splurge of tournaments, the summer
sports scene relaxed into easy golf,
volleyball, and beach fun.
Then late in July pitcher Joe
Chez followed Rog Osenbaugh into
professional baseball by signing
with the Detroit Tigers. Chez, as
signed to Williamsport of the East
ern League, finished the summer
with a 3.11 EKA. Playing with a
last-place team, however, his win
loss record came out a meager 2-(i.
Osenbaugh hail signed with the
PCL's Sacramento Solons and
pitched sometimes effective, some
times wild ball while appearing
mostly in relief roles.
Early August saw an outstanding
performance by a Stanford athlete
just intending to have some week
end fun.
Roy Defflebach of Ihe Summer
Excom thought up the idea for a
summer Hamburger Decathlon, run
ofl under regulation conditions, and

went around campus lining up men
to participate.
Among the entrants was Don
Sanders, freshman deefnsive half
back on last year's grid squad (he's
not out this year, because he failed
to make up an ineligibility). San
ders wont out onto the Angell Field
track and proceeded to sweep the
event, scoring 5,599 points under
the old system, a performance that
would have ranked about 15th in
the nation at the Tulare Olympic J
tryouts.
And then September brought i
tragedy. After being cut from the
San Francisco 49er squad along with
another Card tryoutee, Harry Ilu
gasian — Bobby Bryan was found

summer Hamburger Decathlon, run
ofl under regulation conditions, and

went around campus lining up men
to participate.
Among the entrants was Don
Sanders, freshman deefnsive half
back on last year's grid squad (he's
not out this year, because he failed
to make up an ineligibility). San
ders wont out onto the Angell Field
track and proceeded to sweep the
event, scoring 5,599 points under
the old system, a performance that
would have ranked about 15th in
the nation at the Tulare Olympic J
tryouts.
And then September brought i
tragedy. After being cut from the
San Francisco 49er squad along with
another Card tryoutee, Harry Ilu
gasian — Bobby Bryan was found
dead in bed one Sunday afternoon.
His death, attributed to lung con
gestion, brought to an abrupt close
the career of an outstanding Stan
ford track star and football player.
Although Bryan and Hugasian
failed to make the pro grade, others
didn't. Bob Meyers has survived
the final tquad cut and is now an
important cog in the 49ers' cham
pionship plans.
At Pittsburgh, Gary Kerkorian
has hung onto his job with the
Steelers, and seems destined to be
a competent passing QB in pro cir
cles. Cut from the Pitt squad, pos
sibly in place of Gary, was' Chuck
Qrtmann, All - American tailback
with Michigan in 1950.
And that about brings us around
to fall quarter. On with the football
season!
