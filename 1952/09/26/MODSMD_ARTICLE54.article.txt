### MIKE HUDSON 
Coach Chuck Taylor was host at
a surprise party for the sparse Stan
ford rooting section and 20,000 on
lookers last Saturday, as he un
veiled his 1952 edition of the Stan
ford football team. Alter a disas
trous start, the Cards rolled over a
rough Santa Clara team, 28 to 13.
The biggest and best surprise of
the day was quarterback Bobby
Garrett. Garrett was only so-so in
his brief appearances last season,
but last Saturday he served notice
that he could—at least almost—fili
Gary Kerkorian's All - American
shoes with a remarkable aerial
show. He completed 10 out of 12
passes for 118 yards and two touch
downs, and one of his misses was
a beautiful 45-yard soft-as-silk spi
ral which just bounced off John
Steinberg's finger-tips. Taylor has
promised that Garrett will throw
many more than a dozen passes in
tomorrow's contest.
Defense Surprises
Surprise number two was the
play of the defensive line. Although
it features many new faces, the de

fensive w;ill appears as pood as, if
not bettor than, that of last year's
Rose Bowlers, The two Bronc
touchdowns were the result of Cunt
fumbles and a freak screen-pa?.:.
After the green Card line had a
haif of actual game-time experi
ence, it dug in and stopped the
Broncos cold. Santa Clara was held
to a pitiful 48 yards rushing ati>l
passing and only one first down in
the second half. Tackles John
Stanton and John Broderick were a
pair of big boulders Saturday.
Stanton was all over the field, lie
intercepted a pass, recovered a futn
ble and scored a touchdown. Quite
a day for a defensive lineman. Two
sophomores, Win Wedge and Matt
Arrnitage, opened at the guard slots
and also showed plenty. Bill Sto
rum and Bob Hoegh held down one
end of the line while Ron Eadie, a
real defensive stand-out, was the
other wingman.
Tight I'ass Protection
As for the offensive line, although
they had difficulty opening up holes
inside the tackles, they about made
up for it by giving Garrett air
tight pass - protection. The olTen-

sive line features five new faces
j end John Steinberg, tackle Carter
Pyle, guards Len Muyrhofer and
Piiil Wilson, ami center Jerry Gcild
j berg. The Bob Garrett lo end Sam
J Moiley side-line pass combination
| may make PCC history.
Surprise number three was Bob
| Mathias, although nothing this won
der athlete does can actually be
called a surprise. Mathias was ru
mored to be suffering everything
I from a charley-hor.ve to a leg am
putation, but he tottered out on the
field and carried 18 times for t>7
| yards. He scored a touchdown and
| was the man who carried the ball
| when the first down was needed.
Bob's prettiest run was a 20-yard
burst over right tackle in the sec
ond quarter. In his spare time,
Mathias boomed out 55-yard krck
! ofFs.
Crist, Cook Shine
Skip Crist and Hon Cook also
ran well for the Cards, but Mathias
will obviously do most of the leath
!er - lugging this year. Stanford's
backs fumbled six times, but Tay
lor, Garrett, and center Goldberg
agreee that the trouble will be set
tled tomorrow.
Santa Clara showed a strong team
that should win more than it loses.
Linebacker Bill Payne and guard
Ed Biasatti were tough men to
move out and end Marv Gregory
frustrated Card end sweeps for the
third straight year. Fullback Joe
McCarger made guod yardage on a
stutter play off the right side. The
Broncs have a thin squad and sev
eral of their men went both ways.
They showed their fatigue as the
game wore on.
Stanford showed that they had a
team capable of beating anyone, es
pecially if Garrett can keep pitch
ing those 40-yard strikes. Yes, the
Stanford team gave a surprise
party Saturday, and a good time
was had by all.
