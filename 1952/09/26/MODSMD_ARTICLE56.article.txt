the two mis. Ed, one was intercepted
and the other dropped when it j
might have gone for a TD. The In
dians are planning to present a
well-rounded attack this weekend,
and Garrett should see a good deal
of passing action.
Bob Mathias will be starting at
fullback, closely followed by Cbuck
Eesegiun. Mathias, despite only a
short pre-season practice, did ex- j
ceptionally well la*-1 week, and, ac
cording to Taylor, is still improv
ing with every practice session.
As in previous years, the Im ir.ns |

but two of his defensive squad. Why
a team that wa.s second in offense
last season should Le so halted
again t the Trojans is curious. De
spite hard rushing of the passer by
USC, many scouts believe that the
Cougars did not try enough pass
ing. Or perhaps it was in some
part due to Kircher coaching his
lirst game. Surely the visitors were
no lev; impressive than Stanford
on Chuck Taylor's debut, when the
Indians squeaked by little Oregon.
27-2 U. The Cougars may be com
ing around now and play champion
ship ball tomorrow.
A great pair of ends start (lie
Cougar ft.vward wall. Fd Barker
last year set (lie national and
PCC yardage rccords, receiving
4!J passe> lor <S(M yards. This was
four mure passes than Bill Mc-
C'oll had, g«od for 250 yards more
than any other end in the con
ference. In addition to this he
won honorable mention on last
year's All - American team and
should he lirst string this season,
lie was named on nine out of ten
all-opponent teams last year, and.
scoring 54 points, was the only
man (fifth) out of the ton tvn
scorers in the league that was not
a hack.
On the other end lor WbC is Don
Steinbrunner. Doth receivers are
G-foot-3, Steinbrunner weighinj.
225 pound j. Despite the fact that
Barker was on nine all-opponent
teams and many of those team
faced Stanford s MeColl, Steinbrun
ner still made seven teams, lit* i.
this yc-ar's team captain and played

find themselves with no shortage of j
skilled halfbacks. Bill Rogers, a
soph, and Ron Cook, a junior, will
most likely start, though Skip Crist
and Jim Stewart, another sopho
more, should see their share of ac
tion.
On paper, tiie Cougars have just
about everything it takes, offen
sively. Thev ir.ive the finest pair
if ends in collegiate football, two
skilled, giant tackles, a quarter
back who last year sit a new PCC
record 112 v touchdown pa 'se<\ and
what one coach called "the bull -
elephant buck Held of college

more minutes than any other Cou
gar last year. Defensively lie doub
led as linebacker, while Barker
stayed at end.
Strong Tackles
The tackle position is another
strong spot for the Cougars. The
two offensive regulars are Hal Lo
kovsek, a G-foot-3 senior, and Elmer-
Messenger, the shortest lineman yet

Frosh and voph football mana
gers are needed. Managers receiv?
training table and ticket privi
leges, in addition to team trips.
All interested should see junior
manager Jack Perry on the prac
tice field between :!:.'!(! and 5:30
p.m., Monday through Friday.

;
mentioned, only 6-feet-2. Messen
ger played only on offense last year,
but is rated so valuable he goes
both ways this season. Also in the
| defensive tackle spot are Milt
; Schwenk, 225 pounds and also only
, J-2, and "Shorty" Howard McCants,
who stands G-feet-9.
Quarterbaeking the hosts is Bob
| Burkhart, only a junior this year.
| Last season Burkhart teamed with
j Barker and Steinbrunner to set a
new PCC passing record by throw

football." Little more could be
a>kid of the Cougars, offensively
.'peaking.
Forest Evashevski, who last sea
son coached the squad now picked
by several national maga7ines to go
to the Rose Bowl, left Washin ton
State in order to coach lowa, a team
that will he lucky to win four game
all season. Manning the Cougar
this year is A 1 Kircher, last yeal'
backfield coach.
Kircher has com? into qiits a
pld mine in Pullman. He hns 20
returning veterans, including every
one of his offensive team and all I

i ;ng 15 scoring passes. Only 1G tal-
J lies were registered through the air
: by the Cougars, the other one scored
by Burkhart him elf on a pass from
the fullback. Teaming Burkhart I
with the two ends is a great threat i
in itself without considering the
running game.
The trio of Cougar running j
hacks make u\ one of the heavi
j est hackfields ever seen in tho j
PCC. Fur a change, the fullback
is the lightest man in the hack- !
field. Dick Bower, who will start
in that position, weighs 205, while
halfbacks Jim Head and AI Charl
ton both wevjh 210. In contrast, i
the heaviest back on the Indian
squad is Mathias at 201.
Bower was called the outstanding j
back in last week's Trojan contest.
He is a capable passer, and throws
occasionally from the single wing.
Jim Head played fullback until in
jured in the Stanford game last
year, but, having a great deal of
speed, was shifted to half to allow
both him and Bower to play. Charl
j ton, who ran 05 yards against Cal
in the Cougar backfield. So using
their "little" ends snd tackles and
I their "light' 'backs, the Cougars will
I present a threat both through the
j last year, makes up a fourth passer
air and on the ground tomorrow.


INDIANS BEWARE—Here is the starling WSC backlield against Stanford tomorrow. Halfback
A 1 Charlton, fullback Dick Bower, quarterbackver seen in Western football. Burkhart, Head,
quartet. The backfield is one of the heaviest ever seen in Western football. BBurkhart, Head,
and Charltpn are all 210, while the fullback Bower is the light man at only 205. Burkhart last
year set a PCC record by heaving 15 scoring passes. The Cougars are coached by A 1 Kirchor,
who i3 taking the place of Forest Evashevski.
