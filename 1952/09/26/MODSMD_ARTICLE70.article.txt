# Girls!!! How To Become A Woman
## 
### 
Another crop of bonnie Stanford
lassies will soon be eligible to par
ticipate in a time-honored Inner
Quad tradition. Friday, Oct. 3, will
be the date.
Yes, it has long been said that a
Stanford girl becomes a Stanford
woman only when kissed by a
senior man in front of Memorial
Church under the light of a full
moon.
At this time of the year, there is
always a brand new class of senior
men. And on the fateful Friday
mentioned above the moon will
shine full and bright. See you all
there —Class of '53.
