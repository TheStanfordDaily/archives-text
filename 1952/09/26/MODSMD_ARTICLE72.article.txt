# Sororities? Girl Greeks Axed in '44
## 
### 
Sororicide —that's what Time
magazine called it. The Stan
ford Spectator labeled it the
Row row, while sorority alum
nae used other names. But it all
added up to the same thing in
1944 when the Board of Trustees
abolished sororities from the
Stanford campus.
At first the famous "500" could
be handled by the ten and later nine
sororities at Stanford. But through
the years, the sororities increasingly
tightened into a group of the social
elite.
Ceiling Lifted
After 1934, the friction intensified
when the "500" ceiling was taken
off the number of Stanford women,
and the sororities still took only 250
in all. Alpha Omega Pi, Alpha Phi,
Chi Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Delta
Gamma, Gamma Pni, Kappa Alpha
Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, and Pi
Beta Phi could not raise their quo
tas as the University had done,
Agitatioij Begins
Agitation for some change in tho
system began in 1943. Thirteen Ru
ble sponsors, including both sorority
i an! dormitory women wrote lo th:j
Board of Trustees, stating their dis
satisfaction with the sorority system
at Stanford.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur then ap
pointed three women to select their
j own committees to study the whole
i situation.
Several weeks of extreme feeling
; followed the spon.ors' letter. Th ■
I anti-sorority motto was: "The winds
of freedom do not blow here" (re
versing the university motto).
Surprising Deci.-<io.i
The battle cries died away in the
next year. But on a rainy night the
following April, Dr. Donald B. Tros
| idder made a surprising announce-
I ment to a packed house of sorority
women in Cubberley Auditorium,
j The University president reiter
j ated what one of the members of
the study committee said after sub
mitting their proposed plan: "We
are not here to deny the advantages
of sororities in other places but we
I do not believe that the system is
suitable to our campus."
Response Spontaneous
After Dr. Tresidder had delivered
the decision ending the 50-year pe
riod of sorority living at Stanford,
the women rose spontaneously and
broke into the Stanford Hymn.
Said the president: "We, above
all, are Stanford women.''
