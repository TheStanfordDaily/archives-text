### 
Of the professional schools that !
were departments in the original
organization of Stanford University,
engineering was the largest then
and today ranks second in size to
the School of Education.
In 1891 courses were taught only
in civil and mechanical engineering,
and there were five professors on
the faculty.
Programs in aeronautical, elec
trical, and industrial engineering as
well as in engineering mechanics
and engineering science have been
gradually added since.
Stanford has been a pioneer in
the current trend of giving engi
neers a well-rounded education, in
stead of merely a trade school !

training in a technical specialty.
President Jordan foreshadowed
modern thinking before the turn of
the century when he wrote some
thing to the effect that an engi
neering education is a liberal edu
cation as it demands that a man
learn to think clearly and reason
well, just as the more philosophical
courses.
