### 
When Stanford first opened its
doors in 1891, education in the pro
fession of teaching was an infant
field, and the University's depart
ment in the "History and Art of
Education" became only the ninth
such college department in the
country.
The department developed slowly
at first, but in 1898 President Jor
dan brought to Stanford Dr. Ell
wood P. Cubberley. Dr. Cubberley
thereafter led a 35-year march of
progress in the department, raised
in 1917 to the status of a profes
sional school.
Under "Dad" Cubberley, the fac
ulty added such men as nationally
famous Dr. Lewis M. Terman, pro
gressively greater numbers of
teaching candidates enrolled, and
the school advanced into the study
of such new fields as school admin
istration.
When Dr. Cubberley retired in
1933, he gave to the University all

his earnings from writing, invest
ments, and other outside activities.
This money was used in 1937-38
to erect the Cubberley Library, de
signed by Dean Cubberley himself.
This building now houses the
School of Education, a fitting me
morial to a man who 'gave his en
tire self to the University.
