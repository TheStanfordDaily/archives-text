The baby of Stanford's profes
sional schools, the School of Min
eral Sciences was organized in 1947
as a metamorphosis from the for
mer departments of geology, and
mining and metallurgy.
Since both the older departments
had a common interest in minerals
and locks and had similar basic
training and lab techniques, they
were combined in the new school
to modernize and strengthen the
University's educational structure.
Now the school has acquired
$102,000 worth of new plant in the
form of the first buildings on Inner
Quad rebuilt into modern function
al units.
With an enrollment of more than
125 upper division and graduate
students, the new school already
has such prestige that President
Sterling was able to say in a 1950
talk before its Journal Club, "Stan
ford's is considered one of the three
or four best (mineral science)
schools in the country."
