Although reams of Stanford facts,
I descriptions, and customs are to be
j found in almost every University or
j ASSU bulletin, where they all come
l from has remained somewhat of a
j popular mystery.
i During the summer the idea was
j born in the feeble minds of several
j Daily staffers to edit and publish a
! supplement giving as much back
ground as possible on "The Farm."
This the staff has attempted to do
—produce a flash of several impor-
I tant phases of Stanford's rich his

tory.
Research and spacc limitations
have not permitted the inclusion of
many of the anecdotes and tales
worth retelling. Where names came
from, how traditions orig.nated,
and —in many field? —the hare facts |
themselves have been omitted.
(If this doesn't convince you that j
wo didn't get this up just to sell j
ads:, you've either been here much |
too long or not long enough.—The
Staff)
