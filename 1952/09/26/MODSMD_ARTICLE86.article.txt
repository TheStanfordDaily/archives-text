## 
### 
BATTLEGROUNDS â€”Throughout the year the facilities pictured
above are the stages for athletic competition betwefen Stanford
and visiting foes: Encina Pool, which is normally just for men,
was used by Sharon Geary, Stanford swim star, as she got in
some lessons under Stanford Coach Tom Haynie before leaving
I for the recent Olympics. The pool is used for all swim meets
and water polo games. The Pavilion, pictured at the top, was
built in 1922 when students voluntarily added a dollar to each
guarter's tuition. The site of all home basketball games, the
Pavilion seats 2,700. And below, the massive stadium, seating
90,000, also built in 1922, is where the Indians take the warpath
on fall Saturdays. The stadium also houses track meets and an
i ,-occasional rugby game during the spring.
