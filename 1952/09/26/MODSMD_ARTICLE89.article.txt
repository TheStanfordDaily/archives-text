## Card Athletes' World Renown 
### 
There is no place to start. Stan
ford names are all over the athletic;
world. But being fall, football seem ;
logical. Frankie Albert, Norm
Standlee, and Bruno Banducci from
the 1940 Rose Bowl team are lead
ing the San Francisco 49ers.
Chuck Taylor and Pete Kmetovic,
also of '40, are now head coach and
assistant at Stanford.
Reynolds' Record Greatest
The record of Bob Reynolds is one
that will always stand. This All-
American tackle played for the fa
mous Vow Boys in the Rose Bow!
in 1933, '34, and '35 and played 180
minutes. That's as much as you can
play in three games. Not bad.
Clark Shaughnessy brought tho
"T" to Stanford. Pop Warner, Coach
of All the Years, tutored Stanford
clubs from 1924 to 1932. Ernie Nev
ers, perhaps Stanford's greatest full
back, Bobby Grayson, Bones Ham
ilton, all go down in Card tuid hi *
tory.
In basketball none is more famou
than Hank Luisetti, who led hi;
mates to PCC championships in
193G, '37, and '38, whose 20 strai M
points in the last 11 minutes gav:>
Stanford a win over USC, aril
whose one-handed push shot : < m
swept the country.
Best Cage Squad
Then there were Jim Pollard, Don
Burness, Ed Voss, Howie Dallmar,
and Bill Cowden, who gave Stan
ford its best cage team back in 194 ',
when they were national champion .
Of more recent vintage is George
Yardley, now in the service, who
will soon set the maples afire with
his driving lay-in, amazing eye, and
agility under the boards. And there
is Ed Tucker, Stanford's first Ne",ro
athlete, who only last year was the
leading scorer in the southern di
vision PCC.
There have been baseballers.
Bobby Brown, who has held down
third base for the Yankees, is a
Stanford man. LToyd Merriman,
who gave up football for baseball,
was playing center field for Cin
cinnati before the service got him.
Rog Osenbaugh of last year's var
sity twirled for the Sacramcnto Sc
ions, while Joe Chez, another
chucker, was working for Williams
burg in the Detroit chain. PtoV"
Dahle, a southpaw, preceded them
into pro ball by two seasons.
And Many More
Then in diving there's Pete Des
jardins, who took both springboard
and platform diving in the 1!)28
Olympics. Ted Schroeder, a cham
pion tennis player, and Lawson
Little, who is world famous in golf,
are Stanford men.
Track can't be overlooked. Blaz
ing Ben Eastman, who ran a 4(5.4
440 in 1932; Gay Bryan, who on sev
eral occasions amassed 20 or mo!v
points in dual competition; and a
fellow named Mathias are all stand
outs.
