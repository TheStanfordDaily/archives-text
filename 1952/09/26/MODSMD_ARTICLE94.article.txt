# Young Grid Boss Taylor Is Quite the Man Already
## 
### DICK FIRESTONE 
This season Charles A. (Chuck) Taylor will start his second year
as head football coach at Stanford. Not since the late, great Jim
Lanagan was head man in 1905 had a Stanford alumnus iaken
over the reins of the varsity eleven, as Chuck did in '51.
And what did Taylor do in his first year? Quite a bit. The In-

dians swept nine games in a row '•
and then lost to California and then
Illinois i.i the Hose Howl.
For s .cli a ood showing with
what everyone believed to be only
a mediocre >1 , Taylor was voted
by his conl uraries Coach ol' the
Year.
As Si-anfoi i is ineligible to play
in the Ro-e Bowl by order of the
Pacific Co ist Conference which
does not allow a school to go two
ye-rs in a row to the affair, Chuck
has already been named a member
of the West coaching staff for the
Shrine East - We.;t classic held in
San Francisco in late December.
At 32 years of age, the carrot
topped human dynamo is constantly
on the move, and gets the same all
out efforts from every one of his
players and assistants. In 194G-47,
Stanford - first year back into in
tercollegiate athletics after World
War 11, Athletic Director A 1 Mas
ters asked Taylor to take over as
wrestling coach, and Chuck did, and
performed a great job even though
he was not receiving a salary for
his efforts. Later a rugby mentor
was needed, and again Chuck was
asked to fill the vacancy.
Chuck's reply was, "I don't know
anything al iut the game, but give
me a rule i ook and a ball and I'll
go to work Before long, he had
promoted a big turnout and devel
oped a good squad.
Pep.N Up Iniramurals
Still later, Taylor was called on
to enliven the intramural program, j
Almost immediately he had a fine
organization and a great program j
running. The students greatly ad- i
mired Chuck, and absorbed his en
thusiasm with the result that intra
mural competition soon flourished.
Chuck's main attributes are his
willingness to roll up his sleeves
and work hard; his way with young
sters, who respond to his contagious
effervescence; his common sense;
and his knowledge of understand
ing and teaching football. The Tay
lqjr-coach I Indians will continue to
employ t' T formation, with many

I
I of his own variations.
'iae Redskin mentor was almost
unanimous choice for All - Coast
guard for three years and Ail-
American in his senior year in his
student days back in the early 'for
ties. In 1940, as a member of the
Clark Shaughnessy-coached "Wow
Boys" line, Chuck turned in a su
perlative one-man defensive stand
against the University of Washing
ton.
Th« Huskies were leading 10-0 in
the third quarter, and appeared to
have an upset victory, which would
have ruined Stanford's undefeated
season. Deep in the third quarter,
Washington was again on the march,
penetrating to the Stanford 38-yard
line. The northerners gained nine
yards in one play, and had second
and one on the 29.
Taylor a Stone Wall
At this point Taylor made a stand
that will be long remembered in
Stanford football annals. For three
consecutive plays the slashing red
head held the Huskies without
yielding an inch of ground. Chuck
made all three tackles, his team took
the ball on downs, and in three
plays had its first touchdown. The
Indians, spurred on by Taylor's
brilliant play, went on to win the
game by a 20-10 score.
Stanford concluded an undefeat
ed season with a 21-13 victory over
Nebraska in the Rose Bowl, and
| that great stand of Taylor's seemed
j to be the real turning point of the
season.
Chuck spent three years in the
Navy in World War II as a lieuten
ant (j.g.) and played one year of
professional football for the Miami
Seahawks before joining the Stan
ford coaching staff in 1947. In 1950,
he was line coach for the profes
sional San Francisco 49ers.

Chuck's reply was, "I don't know

ties. In 1940, as a member of the
Clark Shaughnessy-coached "Wow
Boys" line, Chuck turned in a su
perlative one-man defensive stand
against the University of Washing
ton.
Th« Huskies were leading 10-0 in
the third quarter, and appeared to
have an upset victory, which would
have ruined Stanford's undefeated
season. Deep in the third quarter,
Washington was again on the march,
penetrating to the Stanford 38-yard
line. The northerners gained nine
yards in one play, and had second
and one on the 29.
Taylor a Stone Wall
At this point Taylor made a stand
that will be long remembered in
Stanford football annals. For three
consecutive plays the slashing red
head held the Huskies without
yielding an inch of ground. Chuck
made all three tackles, his team took
the ball on downs, and in three
plays had its first touchdown. The
Indians, spurred on by Taylor's
brilliant play, went on to win the
game by a 20-10 score.
Stanford concluded an undefeat
ed season with a 21-13 victory over
Nebraska in the Rose Bowl, and
| that great stand of Taylor's seemed
j to be the real turning point of the
season.
Chuck spent three years in the
Navy in World War II as a lieuten
ant (j.g.) and played one year of
professional football for the Miami
Seahawks before joining the Stan
ford coaching staff in 1947. In 1950,
he was line coach for the profes
sional San Francisco 49ers.


HEAD FOOTBALL COACH CHUCK TAYLOR
This season Charles A. (Chuck) Taylor will start his second year
as head football coach at Stanford. Not since the late, great Jim
Lanagan was head man in 1905 had a Stanford alumnus iaken
over the reins of the varsity eleven, as Chuck did in '51.
And what did Taylor do in his first year? Quite a bit. The In-

dians swept nine games in a row '•
and then lost to California and then
Illinois i.i the Hose Howl.
For s .cli a ood showing with
what everyone believed to be only
a mediocre >1 , Taylor was voted
by his conl uraries Coach ol' the
Year.
As Si-anfoi i is ineligible to play
in the Ro-e Bowl by order of the
Pacific Co ist Conference which
does not allow a school to go two
ye-rs in a row to the affair, Chuck
has already been named a member
of the West coaching staff for the
Shrine East - We.;t classic held in
San Francisco in late December.
At 32 years of age, the carrot
topped human dynamo is constantly
on the move, and gets the same all
out efforts from every one of his
players and assistants. In 194G-47,
Stanford - first year back into in
tercollegiate athletics after World
War 11, Athletic Director A 1 Mas

wrestling coach, and Chuck did, and
performed a great job even though
he was not receiving a salary for
his efforts. Later a rugby mentor

Washington was again on the march,
penetrating to the Stanford 38-yard
line. The northerners gained nine
yards in one play, and had second
and one on the 29.
Taylor a Stone Wall
At this point Taylor made a stand
that will be long remembered in
Stanford football annals. For three
consecutive plays the slashing red
head held the Huskies without
yielding an inch of ground. Chuck
made all three tackles, his team took
the ball on downs, and in three
plays had its first touchdown. The
Indians, spurred on by Taylor's
brilliant play, went on to win the
game by a 20-10 score.
Stanford concluded an undefeat
ed season with a 21-13 victory over
Nebraska in the Rose Bowl, and
| that great stand of Taylor's seemed
j to be the real turning point of the
season.
Chuck spent three years in the
Navy in World War II as a lieuten
ant (j.g.) and played one year of
professional football for the Miami
Seahawks before joining the Stan
ford coaching staff in 1947. In 1950,
he was line coach for the profes
sional San Francisco 49ers.


HEAD FOOTBALL COACH CHUCK TAYLOR
This season Charles A. (Chuck) Taylor will start his second year
as head football coach at Stanford. Not since the late, great Jim
Lanagan was head man in 1905 had a Stanford alumnus iaken
over the reins of the varsity eleven, as Chuck did in '51.
And what did Taylor do in his first year? Quite a bit. The In-

dians swept nine games in a row '•
and then lost to California and then
Illinois i.i the Hose Howl.
For s .cli a ood showing with
what everyone believed to be only
a mediocre >1 , Taylor was voted
by his conl uraries Coach ol' the
Year.
As Si-anfoi i is ineligible to play
in the Ro-e Bowl by order of the
Pacific Co ist Conference which
does not allow a school to go two
ye-rs in a row to the affair, Chuck
has already been named a member
of the West coaching staff for the
Shrine East - We.;t classic held in
San Francisco in late December.
At 32 years of age, the carrot
topped human dynamo is constantly
on the move, and gets the same all
out efforts from every one of his
players and assistants. In 194G-47,
Stanford - first year back into in
tercollegiate athletics after World
War 11, Athletic Director A 1 Mas
ters asked Taylor to take over as
wrestling coach, and Chuck did, and
performed a great job even though
he was not receiving a salary for
his efforts. Later a rugby mentor
was needed, and again Chuck was
asked to fill the vacancy.
Chuck's reply was, "I don't know
anything al iut the game, but give
me a rule i ook and a ball and I'll
go to work Before long, he had
promoted a big turnout and devel
oped a good squad.
Pep.N Up Iniramurals
Still later, Taylor was called on
to enliven the intramural program, j
Almost immediately he had a fine
organization and a great program j
running. The students greatly ad- i
mired Chuck, and absorbed his en
thusiasm with the result that intra
mural competition soon flourished.
Chuck's main attributes are his
willingness to roll up his sleeves
and work hard; his way with young
sters, who respond to his contagious
effervescence; his common sense;
and his knowledge of understand
ing and teaching football. The Tay
lqjr-coach I Indians will continue to
employ t' T formation, with many

I
I of his own variations.
'iae Redskin mentor was almost
unanimous choice for All - Coast
guard for three years and Ail-
American in his senior year in his
student days back in the early 'for
ties. In 1940, as a member of the
Clark Shaughnessy-coached "Wow
Boys" line, Chuck turned in a su
perlative one-man defensive stand
against the University of Washing
ton.
Th« Huskies were leading 10-0 in
the third quarter, and appeared to
have an upset victory, which would
have ruined Stanford's undefeated
season. Deep in the third quarter,
Washington was again on the march,
