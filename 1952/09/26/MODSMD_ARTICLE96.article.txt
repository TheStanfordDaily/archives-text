Looking at Athletics Scholastically
There are few univer ities in this nation that have the stiff entrance
requirements that Stanford places in the path of all aspin nts eager for a
coljege education. And new students will attest that the Board of Admis
sions has not softened recently.
But yet with this ob tacle to overcome, Stanford maintains a fine ath
letic program and usually comes up with a pretty good win-loss record
for any year taken in its entirety.
Such a feat is to be admired, for Stanford is not an athletic in'titu
tion. Stanford has never sought athletes in the manner that many insti
tutions do. Athletes are more than welcome provided they meet the
tests that confront all other applicants for admission.
Hand in hand with this policy is one carried out by the coaching staff.
The general philosophy that Ls believed and tauqht by the coaches on
the Farm is a simple one. It basically follows the theory that athletics
are not by any means everything in life.
Sports Should Develop a Better Man
Athletics are definitely not the superlative at Stanford. Baseball
Coach Everett Dean once said, "Athletics are a means to an end, and
no more." And the end sought is a better man. The rest of the coach
ing stall adheres to that thought. Chuck Taylor, Bob Burnett, Ray
Lunny, Jack Weiershauser, Tom Haynie, and all the others firmly be
lieve that the individual comes bef. ve the win or the los\
And exactly what do Stanford coaches attempt to impart to men who
play for them? Granted they instruct them to play, to play to win,
and to play hard. But above all they instruct them what it is to be a
gentleman, what it is to have sportsman hip. There has been criticism
that gentlemen don't win. We feel that with very, very few if any excep
tions Stanford athletes are gentlemen. And the records show that Stan
ford athletic teams consistently win more than they lo e.
Stanford coaches teach values which may be listed without undue ex
planation. Leadership, respect for authority, beneficial health habits,
sportsmanship, teamwork, re. ponsibility, and good citizenship are all
essential. Furthermore, the aid given Ly coaches in social, emotional,
physical, moral, and mental problems all make for a better man. So*
there they are; the essentials of a doctrine that any conscientious coach
will impress upon his men.
Winning Is by No Means Everything
We are not getting soft when we staunchly agree with such a policy.
Winning is fine; there is nothing like it. But if to win we must sacrifice
the qualities that make a gentleman, then winning is not worth it.
To date Stanford has won with a coaching staff of gentlemen and
teams of gentlemen. And that is excellent. But if Stanford ever makes
athletics the ultimate rather than the means to a better man, that is
when we shall advocate Stanford's dropping from athletic competition.
Don't mistake us. We are very sport conscious. To say otherwise would
be fibbing. But athletics are not what makes a university like Stanford
great. It is not Big Game efforts and Rose Bowl and track records that
make a university great. Rather, research, faculty, education, and the type
of individual produced all go together to grade a university along the
lines of greatness, and make it the valuable institution it is to mankind.
We hope and sincerely trust that we will never see the day when
Stanford is thought a great university solely because it is an athletic
power.
