# Young Grid Boss Taylor Is Quite the Man Already
## 
### DICK FIRESTONE 
This season Charles A. (Chuck) Taylor will start his second year
as head foolball coach at Stanford. Not sinre the late, great Jim
Lanagan was head man in 1905 had a Stanford alumnus taken
over the reins of the varsity eleven, as Chuck did in '51.
And what did Taylor do in his first year? Quite a bit. The In-

diarn swe;,t nine games in a row
and then last to California and then
Illinois in the Rose Bowl.
For such a good rhowing with
what everyone believed to be only
a mediocre club, Taylor was voted
by his contemporaries Coach of the
Year.
As Stanford is ineligible to play
in the Rose Bowl by order of the
Pacific Coast Conference which
does not allow a school to go two
year.; in a row to the affair, Chuck
.las already been named a member
of the West coaching staff for the
Shrine East - West classic held in
3i.n Francisco in late December.
At 32 years of age, the carrot
hopped human dynamo is constantly
on the move, and gets the same all
out efforts from every one of his
players and assistants. In 194G-47,
Stanford's first year back into in
tercollegiate athletics after World
War 11, Athletic Director A 1 Mas
ters asked Taylor to take over as
wrestling coach, and Chuck did, and
performed a great job even though
he was not receiving a salary for
his efforts. Later a rugby mentor
was needed, and again Chuck was
asked to fill the vacancy.
Chuck's reply was, "I don't know
anything about the game, but give
me a rule book and a ball and I'll
go to work. Before long, he had
promoted a big turnout and devel
oped a good squad.
Peps Up Intramurals
Still later, Taylor was called on
to enliven the intramural program.
Almost immediately he had a fine
organization and a great program
running. The students greatly ad
mired Chuck, and absorbed his en
thusiasm with the result that intra- 1
mural competition soon flourished.
Chuck's main attributes are his
willingness to roll up his sleeves
and work hard; his way with young
sters, who respond to his contagious
effervescence; his common sense;
and his knowledge of understand
ing and teaching football. The Tay
lor-coached Indians will continue to
employ the T formation, with many

.v ; i,
t -
I of his own variations.
Yne Redskin mentor was almo t i
unanimous choice for All - Coast
guard for three years and Ail-
American in his senior year in his
student days back in the early 'for
ties. In 1940, as a member of the
Clark Shaughnessy-coached "Wow
Boys" line, Chuck turned in a su
perlative one-nu;n defensive ; tand j
against the University of Wc. hing- !
ton.
The Huskies were leading 10-0 in |
ihe third quarter, and appeared to j
have an upset victory, which would
have ruined Stanford's undefeated
season. Deep in the third quarter,
Washington was again on the march,
penetrating to the Stanford 38-yard ;
line. The northerners gained nine j
yards in one play, and had second |
and one on the 29.
Taylor a Stone Wall
At this point Taylor made a stand j
that will be long remembered in !
Stanford football annals. *For three
consecutive plays the slashing red
head held the Huskies without
yielding an inch of ground. Chuck j
j made all three tackles, his team took
the ball on downs, and in three j
olays had its first touchdown. The I
Indians, spurred on by Taylor's j
brilliant play, went on to win the j
game by a 20-10 score.
Stanford concluded an undefeat- j
ed season with a 21-13 victory over !
Nebraska in the Rose Bowl, and j
that great stand of Taylor's seemed i
to be the real turning point of the
season.
Chuck spent three years in the
Navy in World War II as a lieuten- '
ant (j.g.) and played one year of
professional football for the Miami
Seahawks before joining the Stan
ford coaching staff in 1947. In 1950,
he was line coach for the profes
sional San Francisco 49ers. .
