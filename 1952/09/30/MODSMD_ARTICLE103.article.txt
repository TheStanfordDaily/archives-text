Looking at Athletics Scholastically
There a ,- e few uni"er ities in this nation th;jt have the rti/T entrance
requirements that Stanford places in the path of all a.spirvnts eager for a
college e ucation. And new student, will attest that the Board of Admis
sions has not softened recently.
But yet with this ob tacle to overcome, Stanford maintains a fine ath
letic p.ogram and usually cornis up with u pretty good win-loss record
lor any year taken in its entirety.
Such a feat i+ to lie at'mir"d. for Stanford is not an athletic intitil
tian. Stanford has never sought athletes in the manner thj'l many insti
tutions do, Athletis are more than welcome provided they meet the
lusts that confront all other applicants for admission.
Hand in hand with this policy is one carried out by the coaching staff
The general philoio-hy that is believed and taught by the coaches on
the Farm is a simple one. It ba. i ically follows the theory that athletics
are not by any means everything in life.
Sports Should Develop a Heller Man
Athletics are definitely not the superlative at Stanford. Baseball
Coach Everett Dean once said, ''Athletics are a means to an end, and
no more." And the end sought i-; a better man. The rest of the coach
ing stalT adheres to that thought. Chuck Taylor, Bolt Burnett, Bay
Lunny, Jack Weier haust r, Tom Ilavnie, and all the others firmly be
lieve that the individual comes bef. e the win or the loss.
And exactly what do Stanford coaches attempt to impart to men who
play for them? Granted they instruct them to play, to play to win,
and to play hard. But above all they instruct them what it is to be a
gentleman, what it is to have .sportsman hip. There has been criticism
that gentlemen don't win. We feel that with very, very few if any excep
tions Stanford athletes are gentlemen. And the records show that Stan
ford athletic teams consistently win more than they lo e.
Stanford coaches teach va.uus which may be listed without undue ex
planation. Leader hip, respect for authority, beneficial health habits,
sportsmanship, teamwork, re ponsibility, and good citizen'hip are all
essential. Furthermore, the aid given by coaches in social, emotional,
physical, moral, and mental problems all make for a better man. So
there they are; the ersentials of a doctrine that any conscientious coach
will impre s upon his men.
Winning Is l>v No Means K very tiling
We are not getting roft when we staunchly agree with such a policy.
Winning is fine; there is nothing like it. But if to win we must sacrifice
the qualities that make a gentleman, then winning is not worth it.
To date Stanford has won with a coaching staff of gentlemen and
team ; of gentlemen. And that is excellent. But if Stanford 2vcr makes
athletics the ultimate rather than the means to a better man, that is
when we shall advocate Stanford's dropping from athletic competition.
Don't mistake us. We are very sport conscious. To say otherwise would
be fibbing. But athletics are not what makes a university like Stanford
great. It is not Big Game efforts and Hose Bowl and track records that
make a university great. Rather, research, faculty, education, and the type
of individual produced all go together to grade a university along the
lines of greatness, and make it the valuable institution it is to mankind.
We hope and sincerely tru t that we will never see the day when
Stanford is thought a great university solely hecau e it is an athletic
power.

lieve that the individual comes bef. e the win or the loss.
And exactly what do Stanford coaches attempt to impart to men who
play for them? Granted they instruct them to play, to play to win,
and to play hard. But above all they instruct them what it is to be a
gentleman, what it is to have .sportsman hip. There has been criticism
that gentlemen don't win. We feel that with very, very few if any excep
tions Stanford athletes are gentlemen. And the records show that Stan
ford athletic teams consistently win more than they lo e.
Stanford coaches teach va.uus which may be listed without undue ex
planation. Leader hip, respect for authority, beneficial health habits,
sportsmanship, teamwork, re ponsibility, and good citizen'hip are all
essential. Furthermore, the aid given by coaches in social, emotional,
physical, moral, and mental problems all make for a better man. So
there they are; the ersentials of a doctrine that any conscientious coach
will impre s upon his men.
Winning Is l>v No Means K very tiling
We are not getting roft when we staunchly agree with such a policy.
Winning is fine; there is nothing like it. But if to win we must sacrifice
the qualities that make a gentleman, then winning is not worth it.
To date Stanford has won with a coaching staff of gentlemen and
team ; of gentlemen. And that is excellent. But if Stanford 2vcr makes
athletics the ultimate rather than the means to a better man, that is
when we shall advocate Stanford's dropping from athletic competition.
Don't mistake us. We are very sport conscious. To say otherwise would
be fibbing. But athletics are not what makes a university like Stanford
great. It is not Big Game efforts and Hose Bowl and track records that
make a university great. Rather, research, faculty, education, and the type
of individual produced all go together to grade a university along the
lines of greatness, and make it the valuable institution it is to mankind.
We hope and sincerely tru t that we will never see the day when
Stanford is thought a great university solely hecau e it is an athletic
power.
Looking at Athletics Scholastically
There a ,- e few uni"er ities in this nation th;jt have the rti/T entrance
requirements that Stanford places in the path of all a.spirvnts eager for a
college e ucation. And new student, will attest that the Board of Admis
sions has not softened recently.
But yet with this ob tacle to overcome, Stanford maintains a fine ath
letic p.ogram and usually cornis up with u pretty good win-loss record
lor any year taken in its entirety.
Such a feat i+ to lie at'mir"d. for Stanford is not an athletic intitil
tian. Stanford has never sought athletes in the manner thj'l many insti
tutions do, Athletis are more than welcome provided they meet the
lusts that confront all other applicants for admission.
Hand in hand with this policy is one carried out by the coaching staff
The general philoio-hy that is believed and taught by the coaches on
the Farm is a simple one. It ba. i ically follows the theory that athletics
are not by any means everything in life.
Sports Should Develop a Heller Man
Athletics are definitely not the superlative at Stanford. Baseball
Coach Everett Dean once said, ''Athletics are a means to an end, and
no more." And the end sought i-; a better man. The rest of the coach
ing stalT adheres to that thought. Chuck Taylor, Bolt Burnett, Bay
Lunny, Jack Weier haust r, Tom Ilavnie, and all the others firmly be
