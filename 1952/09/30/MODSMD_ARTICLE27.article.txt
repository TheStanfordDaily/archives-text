# Welcome to the Rest of You
## 
### 
Welcome back! The freshmen traditionally
get a full round of welcome , . . this is for the
rest of you.
To tin* Sophomores . . .
It's called the "Sophomore Slump" and many
times it's a very real thing. As a freshman yen
were v/oced by every organization on campus.
Sponsors and social chairmen worked hard to
rsoax you out of your shell. Just about everyone
you knew tried to convert you to his own time
tested study methods.
Now you're more or less on your own. The
help and the fun are still there, but they're less
hkely to hunt you out.
but you're starting a year of challenge. You
still have time to experiment, to correct your
mistakes. You have time to start from the bot
tom in an organization, to sample a few subjects
before you definitely choose a major.
Most of you are adjusting to a new living
group. Make the most of it. Learn from the
upperclassmen you'll be living with perhaps
for the first time at Stanford.
In everything — good luck. Those of us
whose sophomore years are past envy you.
To the Juniors . . .
You've a good year ahead. You've been
around long enough to know what you're do
ing, but the cold, cruel world isn'l yet breathing
down your neck.
You're starting out on the adventure of your
major. If you find you've made a mistake,
there's time to change. Remember that. But
for most of you the specialization will be a new
adventure.
And if you're interested in an activity, go
ahead. Don't worry about your late start. The
Daily itself boasts several "junior" success
stories. Your interest and enthusiasm can

counteract the other disadvantages.
The tendency to slip into a routine will be
strong about new. You're two years away from
the realities of life "on the outside"; graduation
seems a long \:ay off. But don't let yourself
forget that there's a war in Korea, a national
election going on, and that you have respon
sibilities as an educated citizen of the world.
To the Seniors . . .
So little time left . . . but it can be enough
for a lot of things. Activities still have some
thing to olfer you; the 45 units ahead can
represent real learning, not just skimming the
academic surface; you have a year to take ad
vantage of the things you've neglected before.
Try going to the Tuesday Evening Series and
take a look inside the Art Gallery.
Make an increased effort to look at the world
learned to what's happening outside Stanford.
It seems like such a short time, but actually
it's an entire fourth of the whole. So don't
waste it.
To the Grail Students . . .
You have a more important part to play here
than you perhaps realize. Of course, we know
that studies will take a bigger chunk out of
your life, and many of you just don't care about
Rally Com and Back to the Farm Week.
But you can make an important contribution
in Farm activities if you want to. The publica
tions will be grateful for your talent; organiza
tions like the IIR put no limits on age or ma
turity.
Student government wants and needs you.
Your own Graduate Student Council has been
set up to make sure you have a proper voice
in your government.
Don't isolate yourself from the Stanford com
munity. Citizenship starts at home.

You're starting out on the adventure of your
major. If you find you've made a mistake,
there's time to change. Remember that. But
for most of you the specialization will be a new
adventure.
And if you're interested in an activity, go
ahead. Don't worry about your late start. The
Daily itself boasts several "junior" success
stories. Your interest and enthusiasm can

counteract the other disadvantages.
The tendency to slip into a routine will be
strong about new. You're two years away from
the realities of life "on the outside"; graduation
seems a long \:ay off. But don't let yourself
forget that there's a war in Korea, a national
election going on, and that you have respon
sibilities as an educated citizen of the world.
To the Seniors . . .
So little time left . . . but it can be enough
for a lot of things. Activities still have some
thing to olfer you; the 45 units ahead can
represent real learning, not just skimming the
academic surface; you have a year to take ad
vantage of the things you've neglected before.
Try going to the Tuesday Evening Series and
take a look inside the Art Gallery.
Make an increased effort to look at the world
learned to what's happening outside Stanford.
It seems like such a short time, but actually
it's an entire fourth of the whole. So don't
waste it.
To the Grail Students . . .
You have a more important part to play here
than you perhaps realize. Of course, we know
that studies will take a bigger chunk out of
your life, and many of you just don't care about
Rally Com and Back to the Farm Week.
But you can make an important contribution
in Farm activities if you want to. The publica
tions will be grateful for your talent; organiza
tions like the IIR put no limits on age or ma
turity.
Student government wants and needs you.
Your own Graduate Student Council has been
set up to make sure you have a proper voice

still have time to experiment, to correct your

before you definitely choose a major.
Most of you are adjusting to a new living
group. Make the most of it. Learn from the
upperclassmen you'll be living with perhaps
for the first time at Stanford.
In everything — good luck. Those of us
