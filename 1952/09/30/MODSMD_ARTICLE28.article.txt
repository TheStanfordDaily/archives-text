# A 						Turn for the Worse

"What with expense funds, puppies, and ten
dollar checks making the headlines, we feel
the Presidential campaign is taking a turn for
the worse.
Both sides are readying their supplies of mud
and counter-accusations are flying through the
oir. In many cases, rational issues are being
replaced by emotional appeals.
We refer particularly io Senator Nixon's re
cent speech. Whatever the original intentions
of those who started the incident, the net result
has been a tremendous gain for the Republican
party.
IJk-.on played the show for all It was worth.
He aroused sympathy in millicr.s of people
who had probably never heard his name be
fore. the saying goes, "It doesn't matter
what you say about me; just get my name in
print."
Now Stevenson is facing counter-charges of
corruption. In both cases, shouts of "graft"
have drowned out discussion of the real moral
issues involve .1. Too little emphasis has been

given to the basic guestion: were the funds the
usual political contributions or were they
bribes, used to buy special favors?
When he accepted the Presidential nomina
tion, Stevenson told the Democratic conven
tion:
"What concern me, in common with
thinking partisans of both parties, is not just
winning the election, but how it is won, how
well we can take advantage of this great quad
rennial opportunity to debate issues sensibly
and soberly.
"1 hope and pray that we Democrats, win or
lose, can campaign not as a crusade to exter
minate the opposing party . . . but as> a great
opportunity to educate and elevate a people
whose destiny is leadership, not alone of a
rich, prosperous, contented country as in the
past, but of a world in ferment."
Both parlies have failed to live up to these
aims. We hope the v/eeks ahead will see a turn
for the better. -Dorothy Dodge
