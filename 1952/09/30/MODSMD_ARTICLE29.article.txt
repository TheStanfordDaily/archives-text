### BOB STETSON 
(Ed Note: The f< flowing Hull Session was written
by Bob Stetson, a member of the class of '56. The
Daily brings it to you as a sample of the Freshman
viewpoint.)
The class of '56 has entered and is now as much a
part of Stanford as any other class, (1 keep telling my
:>'li). Prc-reg week has como and gone, leaving us
writhing in convulsions on our pallet beds.
Besides anything else you may call it, pre-rog week
was an experience. Hark ye, then, unto the voice of
experience.

Otto von Bismark said, "1 have seen three emperors
in their nakedness and the sight was not inspiring."
While taking the physical examinations, I saw the
male part of the freshmen class naked, and also found
the sight not inspiring.

Let it be under'tood at this point that 1 have never
spoken disrespectfully of the equator.

Dean Winbigler built up tin l hopes of the freshmen
about the English Matriculation tests by saying that
when one thinks he has flunked a test, he usually
passes with flying colors. A little list posted in con
spicuous places went a long way towards making his
philosophy look pretty bad.

"In examinations, fools ask questions the wise can
not answer," said Oscar Wilde.

In the confusion of beginning school and registering,
many freshmen became discouraged. Buck up, one

can survive everything nowadays cxcept death.

The consensus of opinion among the freshmen is
that there is nothing wrong with Encina that a miracle
couldn't fix.

Wine is the drink of the gods, milk the drink of
babies, tea the drink of women, and water the drink
of beasts. r l he beasts that eat in the Encina dining
room would like to request water to drink with their
meals.

If you shut your ryes when you read this, it's not

Last year Stanford freshmen were all seniors. My
first-year morale is boosted by the fact that when I
was a senior I thanked the gods everyday for the
fie !.men. Upperclassmen need someone to feel su
perior to. Freshmen serve adequately in this capacity.
So upperclassmen, don't < coff at us. Just say a silent
prayer of thanksgiving.
* * *
I kissed my first woman and smoked my first ciga
rette on the limit day; 1 have never had time for
tobacco since.
Thi■ fit in well with the fact that smoking is not
allowed on inner-quad and that a Stanford girl be
come;: a Stanford woman when she is kissed on a
moonlight night by a senior on inner-quad.

Five people can be seated at a table in 120 different
