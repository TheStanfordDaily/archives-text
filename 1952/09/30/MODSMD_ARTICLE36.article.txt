## Pumper Truck Joins Firehouse 
### 
Fire insurance rates on campus
might he reduced now that the
Stanford (ire department has com
pleted another step in its moderni
zation program.
The new :tep is the addition of a
j new combination squad and pumper
truck to the department's fleet of
I fire-fighting vehicles.
'I he new engine, manufactured
i by the Van Pelt Company of
Newark, has a pumping capacity
of 600 gallons a minute. Along
with its pump it carries 500 gal-
Inns of water for use at -rural fires.
The rig is considered one of the
! most modern lire engines now in
I operation.
It brings to four the number of
, engines at the Firehouse on Santa
j Teresa Street.
The other engines are a ladder
: truck, a pumper, and a giant tank
wagon used for grass fires.
Hie lade'er truck is the oldest
I | iece of apparatus being used, and
its replacement will mark the
completion of the modernization
program, according to Fire Chief
! John Mavston.
The ladder truck, a 1936 Ford, is
considered obsolete. No plans as
I yet have been announced to replace
the ladder truck with a more mod
; ern piece of equipment.
Presently the Stanford campus
has a rating as a sixth-class fire
insurance city. Such a rating is
made by the Board of Underwrit
ers and is considered fair for a
I community this size.
The addition o'f the new squad
J truck might reduce Stanford to a
