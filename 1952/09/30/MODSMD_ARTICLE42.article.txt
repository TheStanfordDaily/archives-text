Bright red splashes of "SC" on
Palm Drive, Hoover Libe, and Me
morial Court greeted students ar
riving last weekend —remains of a
paint raid prior to the Stanford vs.
University of Santa Clara football
game last Saturday.
In another raid a week ago the
campus was visited by Santa Clara
students, who badly painted the
Main Libe (since cleaned) and also
left an "SC" in sand on the Stanford
Stadium turf.
The students and faculty of Santa
Clara took immediate action follow
ing the raid. The entire Executive
Council of the Associated Students
of the University of Santa Clara
came to Stanford and personally
apologized for the raid.
Wrote Student Body President
John McMahon, "May I ask you
(Assistant Counselor for Men Rob
ert Huff) to accept for your Uni
versity and its student body the sin
cere apology of the six Santa Clara
students who disfigured the cam
pus?"
McMahon also wrote that the six
students responsible for the first
raid voluntarily appeared before the
Executive Council and admitted
their guilt, and that payment for
the damages would be assumed by
Sanat Clara.
