# Museum Offers Bone Display
## Old Artifacts To Be Shown 
### 
Tomorrow students and faculty
will get a chance to see some origi
nal Stanford Indians —or at least
their remains.
The remarkable display of what
may have been Stanford's earliest
inhabitants—possibly dating back to
1500 B.C.—is offered by courtesy of
Professor Bert A. Gerow of the So
ciology and Anthropology Depart
ment.
The exhibit will he open from
10 a.m. to ;t p.m. in the basement
of the Stanford Museum, where
Dr. Gerow has set up his labora
tory. The entrance is on the
ground level at the rear of the
building.
Dr. Gerow spent the summer re
moving the ancient Stanfordites and
their possessions from the richest
archaeological find ever made in
this area. Over 2,600 artifacts (tools,
weapons, jewelry, etc.) were recov
ered along with human remains
from 37 separate burials.
So far, no gridiron relics have
turned up, unless a bone whistle in
burial number 37 could be so
classed. Evidence that ancient Stan
lord Indians played for keeps was
discovered in burials 34 and 36,
however, which yielded punctured
skulls.
A unique feature of the display
will be actual recovery work still
under way on a few of the bur
ials most recently brought from

the discovery site. Itoland and
Maryanne Force, a graduate stu
dent couple who helped Dr. Gerow
excavate most of the burials this
summer, will be on hand to ex
plain the material.
Additional work at the discovery
site in University Village, a housing
development located on the edge of
the by in East Palo Alto, will he
carried on this fall. A three-unit
course in archeological field meth

ods taught by Dr. Gerow will give
students a rare opportunity for first
hand experience.
Students in Introductory Anthro
pology will also have an occasional
turn at two other sites, which Dr.
Gerow plan, lo investigate. One is
known as Castro Mound, located at
Alma Street and San Antonio Road.
The other is near the Hiilcr Heli
j copter Company, along the approach
to Dumbarton Bridge.


REMAINS OF ANCIENT STANFORD INDIANS are seen being

by Mrs. Maryanne Force, graduate student, and Professor Bert

under way on a few of the bur
ials most recently brought from

the discovery site. Itoland and
Maryanne Force, a graduate stu
dent couple who helped Dr. Gerow
excavate most of the burials this
summer, will be on hand to ex
plain the material.
Additional work at the discovery
site in University Village, a housing
development located on the edge of
the by in East Palo Alto, will he
carried on this fall. A three-unit
course in archeological field meth

ods taught by Dr. Gerow will give
students a rare opportunity for first
hand experience.
Students in Introductory Anthro
pology will also have an occasional
turn at two other sites, which Dr.
Gerow plan, lo investigate. One is
known as Castro Mound, located at
Alma Street and San Antonio Road.
The other is near the Hiilcr Heli
j copter Company, along the approach
to Dumbarton Bridge.


REMAINS OF ANCIENT STANFORD INDIANS are seen being
removed from the area's richest archeological discovery to date
by Mrs. Maryanne Force, graduate student, and Professor Bert
A. Gerow of the Sociology and Anthropology Department. Re
sults of their summer's discoveries—37 burials and over 2,600
artifacts—will be exhibited tomorrow in the basement of the
Stanford Museum.
Tomorrow students and faculty
will get a chance to see some origi
nal Stanford Indians —or at least
their remains.
The remarkable display of what
may have been Stanford's earliest
inhabitants—possibly dating back to
1500 B.C.—is offered by courtesy of
Professor Bert A. Gerow of the So
ciology and Anthropology Depart
ment.
The exhibit will he open from
10 a.m. to ;t p.m. in the basement
of the Stanford Museum, where
Dr. Gerow has set up his labora
tory. The entrance is on the
ground level at the rear of the
building.
Dr. Gerow spent the summer re
moving the ancient Stanfordites and
their possessions from the richest
archaeological find ever made in
this area. Over 2,600 artifacts (tools,
weapons, jewelry, etc.) were recov
ered along with human remains
from 37 separate burials.
So far, no gridiron relics have
turned up, unless a bone whistle in
burial number 37 could be so
classed. Evidence that ancient Stan
lord Indians played for keeps was
discovered in burials 34 and 36,
however, which yielded punctured
skulls.
A unique feature of the display
will be actual recovery work still
under way on a few of the bur
ials most recently brought from

the discovery site. Itoland and
Maryanne Force, a graduate stu
dent couple who helped Dr. Gerow
