# Chaparral
## 
### 
Now that the Old Boy has come
out of his summer hibernation at
Rossotti's back room, he realizes
that the Chaparral needs workers
this year.
People of all ages, texes, and
specifications are needed to write,
draw, take pictures, and sell adver
tising. The first issue of the Chap
pie will come late in October.
Anyone interested in having his
talents put to such worthwhile use
can discuss matters with the Old
Boy at his den in the Chappie
shack any afternoon.
