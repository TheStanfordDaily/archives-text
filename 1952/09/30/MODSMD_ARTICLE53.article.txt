# Financial Fireworks Pep up Campaign
## Incomes Explored 
### HADLEY ROFF Daily Political Editor 
The political campaign is cur
rently reading like a chapter
from a true confession magazine.
In unprecedented proclama
tions, the various candidates are
revealing the details of their pri
vate financial affairs.
The Korean War, the North At
lantic Pact, the Tidelands Oil dispute
and other vital foreign and domestic
problems have been shadowed by
the current round of confessions.
Certainly, nothing in this campaign
has aroused so much interest as the
special funds set up to aid particular
politicians.
The fireworks began two weeks
ago when a New York tabloid, the
Post, broke the story that an $18,000
expense fund had been established
by 20 California businessmen for
Richard Nixon, GOP Vicc-Presi
dential nominee.
Nixon, under severe attack for a
week, fired back last Tuesday when,
on a nation wide radio and television
hook up, he laid bare his financial
accounts.
The response to Nixon's highly
emotional confession was immedi
ate and powerful.
Thousands of letters poured
across the country to Republican
headquarters in Washington D.C.
and indicated the first maior break
for the OOP since the inception of
the campaign last July.
The GOP campaign, despite the fact
that General Dwight Eisenhower was
far better known than the Demo
cratic standard bearer. Adlai Steven
son, crawled along without fire, with

out enthusiasm.
Many times Eisenhower kindled
no enthusiasm.
His audiences were reported to be
listless, even inattentive.
Meanwhile, Stevenson, with his
deft humor, began stepping more
and more into the spot light.
He began gaining on Eisenhower
about the middle of September, ac
cording to the polls taken by var
ious newspapers across the country.
Though Eisenhower still held an
edge in the polls (about 48 percent oi
the voters according to Gallup) Ste
venson was showing steady gains.
(By mid-September Stevenson's pop
ularity had risen from a low of 37
percent at the outset of the campaign
to 42 percent.)
Hut neither candidate seemed
able to strike on a campaign issue
explosive enough to break open the
gates of voters' impassivity.
Stevenson, with his scholarly ao
proach, was able to win some inde
pendent support, but what support
he gained hardly indicated a ground
swell of popular support.
Then cainc the Nixon issue, ex
plosive in a high degree.
For a week the Democrats
chortled over the discovery. And
the voters were suddenly jarred to
wakefulness and began teetcving
from the Republicans to the Demo
crats.
A clamor was raised, calling for
Nixon's resignation. The tide seemed
to be rolling in Democratic favor.
Nixon, who had long been point
ing a finger at what he called "the
terrible mess in Washington," des
perately sought for an out.
But no easy out presented itself.
The general and his advisors with
held comment, waiting to hear a
full explanation of the .$lB,OOO fund.
On a whistle stop tour of the San
Joaquin valley in central California,
Nixon tried to answer hecklers' ques
tions about the fund.
It was not easy.
Then last Tuesday he took to the
radio and television, and with a tear
strained voice, bared his private
finances even to the point of listing
his debts.
"Remarkable," cried the nation,
and the letters and telegrams be
gan winging their way to Washing
ton and Republican headquarters.
Stevenson laid open his account

books yesterday; Sparkman is due to
do the same any day.
Charges of corruption and wrong
doing involving the funds arc being
hurled by both parties, and the
campaign seems destined to be
inircd in the mud of charge and >
counter chargc.
Though the real outcome of the
fund debate can hardly be ap- :
praised with accuracy now, it
would seem as if the Republicans
capital!/,cd well on what could have
been a damaging blow.
Nixon's speech was a well-studied '
emotional appeal, one that prompted i
immediate reply.
Without question Eisenhower's
hcsitency to back his youthful
partner when the fund story firSt
broke can be considered a master 1
political stroke. Eisenhower's re
luctance, his demanding that Nixon
"come as clean as a hound's tooth" [
seemed to cmphasi/.c his contention
that he will not compromise with
corruption even in his own party. J
Another super emotional item
which seemingly indicates Republi
can favor, is the sweeping election
victory claimed by Senator Joe Mc-
Carthy in Wisconsin early this
month.
Though McCarthy's unwhole
some tactics have been under se
vere fire, he still claimed a 100,000
vote margin over his combined op
position and indicated the people's
disfavor, with alleged communism |
with government.
It is with these two issues, the j
suggestion of corruption inherent in i
funds (particularly if the fund totals
more than $150,000 as Stevenson's
does) and communism, that the Re- j
publicans seem able to make the most
hay.
At the moment it would seem as
if the Republicans are on the of
fensive and the Democrats on the
defensive.
But that situation could change
in a minute.
The only conci'etc indication that
can be derived from current cam
paign manuevers is that the election
eering will take a tumble for the ;
worse.
No doubt, both parties will rely
more and more on emotion provoking
harangues than on sensible discussion
of the issues.

Without question Eisenhower's

Another super emotional item

Carthy in Wisconsin early this

Though McCarthy's unwhole
some tactics have been under se
vere fire, he still claimed a 100,000
vote margin over his combined op
position and indicated the people's
disfavor, with alleged communism |
with government.
It is with these two issues, the j
suggestion of corruption inherent in i
funds (particularly if the fund totals
more than $150,000 as Stevenson's
does) and communism, that the Re- j
publicans seem able to make the most

It is with these two issues, the j

A BOARD ILLUSTRATION—Dwight Eisenhower, speaking to crowd at Springfield, 0., holds aloft
two pieces of white pine to outline his views on inflation. At right is Senator Robert Taft who
accompanied the general on his tour through Ohio and West Virginia.
The political campaign is cur
rently reading like a chapter
from a true confession magazine.
In unprecedented proclama
tions, the various candidates are
revealing the details of their pri
vate financial affairs.
The Korean War, the North At
lantic Pact, the Tidelands Oil dispute
and other vital foreign and domestic
problems have been shadowed by
the current round of confessions.
Certainly, nothing in this campaign
has aroused so much interest as the
special funds set up to aid particular
politicians.
The fireworks began two weeks
ago when a New York tabloid, the
Post, broke the story that an $18,000
expense fund had been established
by 20 California businessmen for
Richard Nixon, GOP Vicc-Presi
dential nominee.
Nixon, under severe attack for a
week, fired back last Tuesday when,
on a nation wide radio and television
hook up, he laid bare his financial
accounts.
The response to Nixon's highly
emotional confession was immedi
ate and powerful.
Thousands of letters poured
across the country to Republican
headquarters in Washington D.C.
and indicated the first maior break
for the OOP since the inception of
the campaign last July.

that General Dwight Eisenhower was
far better known than the Demo

Many times Eisenhower kindled

His audiences were reported to be
listless, even inattentive.
Meanwhile, Stevenson, with his
deft humor, began stepping more
and more into the spot light.
He began gaining on Eisenhower
about the middle of September, ac
cording to the polls taken by var
ious newspapers across the country.
Though Eisenhower still held an
edge in the polls (about 48 percent oi
the voters according to Gallup) Ste
venson was showing steady gains.
(By mid-September Stevenson's pop
ularity had risen from a low of 37
percent at the outset of the campaign
to 42 percent.)
Hut neither candidate seemed
able to strike on a campaign issue
explosive enough to break open the
gates of voters' impassivity.
Stevenson, with his scholarly ao
proach, was able to win some inde
pendent support, but what support
he gained hardly indicated a ground
swell of popular support.
Then cainc the Nixon issue, ex
plosive in a high degree.
For a week the Democrats
chortled over the discovery. And
the voters were suddenly jarred to
wakefulness and began teetcving
from the Republicans to the Demo

A clamor was raised, calling for
Nixon's resignation. The tide seemed
to be rolling in Democratic favor.
Nixon, who had long been point
ing a finger at what he called "the
terrible mess in Washington," des
perately sought for an out.
But no easy out presented itself.
The general and his advisors with

Nixon tried to answer hecklers' ques

It was not easy.
