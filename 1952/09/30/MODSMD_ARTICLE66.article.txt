# No Palouse Jinx; Bob Garrett's Arm, Toe, Give Indians 14 to 13 Win Over Tough WSC
## Bob Passes for Two TD's, Kicks Vital Extra Points 
### PETE GROTHE 
PULLMAN, Wash.—They're saying right now in Pullman that
this Stanford team is as good, if not better, than last year's Card
team at the same time.
They're saying this despite the fact that the Indians brushed
past the Washington State Cougars 14 to 13, the margin of victory

being a blocked conversion attempt.
Chuck Taylor's crew tacked up
; two superbly-executed touchdowns,
J and then hung on tight around the
corners while the Cougars were hav
i ing their day.
Whether the 1952 outfit is as potent
j as last year's PCC champs is a moot j
! question, but the game did settle one t
, point: that Bob Garrett is on his way !
j to being Stanford's best quarterback
! since Frankie Albert.
Passes foe Two TD's
Tho thick-armed signal-caller from
| San Marino hurled two touchdown
passes, thus duplicating a feat he !
performed last week against Santa
Clara. Taylor remarked after the I
] game, "Everyone thought I was
j crazy when I said that Garrett would
be a bptter quarterback than Ker
! korian, but, by golly, now they know
; that I'm right."
With six minutes and 45 seconds
left in the first quarter, the Indians
had seven on the board.
Cougar quarterback Bob Burkhart !
punted to the Stanford 47. Bob Ma- '
( thias, who traded his track scanties
for football knickerbockers cracked
| for four at center. Half Ron Cook, j
I who is vastly improved over last '
( year, lost two at left end and then
] made them back at guard. It was
fourth and six on the WSC 49, and
; any other quarterback would have
i kicked, but not Garrett.
Gamble Works
He gambled, and it worked.
He faded back, spotted Cook in the
open, and fired a bullet which Cook
j gobbled up and took to the 29.
Skip Crist was arrested with noth
ing gained, and then Mathias, 10
pounds heavier than he was last grid ;
season, cracked up the center for 10. 1
| Two plays took the ball to the 16.
I At this juncture, Cook accepted a
| Garrett-propelled aerial on the one,
over two Washington State defenders,
j and powered into the end zone. The
! catch brought back memories of Bill
| McColl, as Cook had to claw the
heavens to get the ball.
Garrett added the conversion.
The Card's second scoring drive
gobbled up 78 yards in 14 plays.
With four yards to the goal on fourth
down. Garrett zipped a pass to loose
limbed John Steinberg for the touch
-down. However, the zebra shirts

112
ruled buckfield in motion, and Stan
ford involuntarily retreated to the
nine. This didn't phase Garrett. He
hit his favorite target, piano-playing
| Sam Morley, on the goal and then
| added the 14th point.
The half ended at 14 to 0, and from
i there on Al Kircher's Cougai's gained
i momentum. A Mathias fumble gave
the hosts the ball in the third quarter,
| and they never relinquished the ball
[ until Dwight Pool crashed the final
11 yards. End Ed Barker converted.
Mathias Plays Goat
Mathias played the goat again as he
fumbled on the 311, and the same Fool
j executed a clever cutback for the
laft 13 yards. Menlo transfer Dick
Monteith blocked Barker's conver
j sion attempt ... a very impoitant
| play.
Stanford's defense, except for those
two lapses, played a superb game.
Linebackers Ted Tanner anil Chuck
Essegian were positively ferocious
i as was end Ron Eadie, who cares
| nothing for life and limb once he
j gets in a game. Sophomore guard
Matt Armitage also drew the plaudits
of the crowd.
The blocking left something to he
desired, although Garrett pass pro
-1 tection was generally excellent. Gar
rett usually had time to fry an egg.
; Sunny side up.
Only Crist Injured
The only injury of any conse
quence was a "knee" which Crist in
curred. He should be out from two
to three weeks.
The Stanford victory was borne out
by the statistics. The Indians gained
160 yards rushing to the Cougars' 131.
The kids from the Farm had the
passing advantage also, 116 to 96.
All of which brings Stanford to the
Michigan game. They said on Janu
ary 2nd last year that the Indians
couldn't handle Big Ten competition.
Whether or not that is true will be
determined this Saturday.


GAMBLE WORKS—Here's halfback Ron Cook hauling in Bob |
Garrett's fourth down pass for an 18 yard gain in Saturday's
WSC game. With last down and six to go on the Cougar 49, |
and everyone expecting a punt, Bob crossed up the defense and
threw his pass to Cook. This continued the drive for the first
Card touchdown of the game. —Photo by United Press
