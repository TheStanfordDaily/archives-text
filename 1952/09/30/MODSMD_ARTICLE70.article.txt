(Editor's note: This is tfic» fir: tof two articles explaining football in
general and football at Stanford. Many uf u have grown up playing
loot hall and understand the ganu*. Many others, some men as .veil as ;
women, have been uninitiated spectators out f<»r a fun-, sun-filled Sat

Football came to the United St: tes with the Pilgrims. Before that it j
was a game played by the Greeks and Roman ;. Ami trangely enough it
didn't differ much from what the Pilgrims brought vith them.
And down through the many, many years the rules and object cf the
game have changed little.
UNIFORM SiZM FIELD
Today all football fields are uniform in size; Lh .t is, they are 100 yards
Jong from j;oai to goal and a speck over 50 yards wile. The field is
divided by chalk marks into 10-yard division
On this battlefield two teams of 11 men oppose each other. And fcy
using highly developed techniques of of!« n: ive an 1 defensive maneuvers
thrill thousands and thousands in the stands. Many spectators are likewise
thrilLd by Mrs. Jones' new fall hat or the date that Hill is e corting.
And what" is the object of this Saturday afternoon madness? The 22
brawling individuals are attemplin /, one team at a time, to advance the
ball past the opponents' goal for a score.
To this score of six points for a touchdown, as it is known, can be
added one point by a conversion which consists of l icking tha ball from !
placement (someone holding the ball) through the goal post- and over the I
cross bars. This extra point may aiso be added by pa sing or running
the ball over the goal line from where the ball i put into play after a
touchdown, the two-yard line.
Points may also be .scored by a field goal, which i ; place-kicking the
ball in the same manner as a eonver.- ion. Howt-vi r, a successful field goal
registers three points as it i.s often attempted when the making of c !
touchdown seems improbable. It cr.n be attempt'd IVor.i anywhere on the
field, at any time.
A safety is two points but they go to the team without the ball. A j
safety occurs primarily whs n the ball is in the pose.-.ion of the offensive
team and the ball carrier is tickled in the ol'rnsive team's end zone
(10-yard sector at each end of the field where ail scaling i.s do.ie). Two j
points are awarded the defense for a safety.
A game commences when the referee blows his whistle and one team
kicks off to the other. Alter a kickoff and the receiver of the ball has
been tackled, the team that received the kick i on the offensive and i
given four down, to advance the ball 10 yats.s toward the opposite goal
line, which they do by passing or running.
II they make the yardage thty are given another set of four downs.
This continues until they have scon d or have lost the ball by failing to
make the 10 yards in the four downs, or have fumbled, have had a pass
intercepted, or have puntjJ (kicking without having another player hold
the bail).
DEFENSE BECOMES OFFENSE
When the ball i.s lost on downs the defensive team becomes the offen
sive one and attempts to move'the bail toward the opposite end of the
field.
The usual way to end a down is when a runner is tackled and his knee
touches the ground. When this happens the referee toots his whistle and
another down starts by having the team line up after it forms a huddle
to decide the next play.
The play commences when the ball i.s handed or passed backward by
the center. Downs are also ended by an incomplete pass, loss of down by j
penalty, or running out of bounds with the ball.
That's the basis of the struggle that takes place on Saturdays. TOMOR- \

UNIFORM SiZM FIELD
Today all football fields are uniform in size; Lh .t is, they are 100 yards
Jong from j;oai to goal and a speck over 50 yards wile. The field is
divided by chalk marks into 10-yard division
On this battlefield two teams of 11 men oppose each other. And fcy
using highly developed techniques of of!« n: ive an 1 defensive maneuvers
thrill thousands and thousands in the stands. Many spectators are likewise
thrilLd by Mrs. Jones' new fall hat or the date that Hill is e corting.
And what" is the object of this Saturday afternoon madness? The 22
brawling individuals are attemplin /, one team at a time, to advance the
ball past the opponents' goal for a score.
To this score of six points for a touchdown, as it is known, can be
added one point by a conversion which consists of l icking tha ball from !
placement (someone holding the ball) through the goal post- and over the I
cross bars. This extra point may aiso be added by pa sing or running
the ball over the goal line from where the ball i put into play after a
touchdown, the two-yard line.
Points may also be .scored by a field goal, which i ; place-kicking the
ball in the same manner as a eonver.- ion. Howt-vi r, a successful field goal
registers three points as it i.s often attempted when the making of c !
touchdown seems improbable. It cr.n be attempt'd IVor.i anywhere on the
field, at any time.
A safety is two points but they go to the team without the ball. A j
safety occurs primarily whs n the ball is in the pose.-.ion of the offensive
team and the ball carrier is tickled in the ol'rnsive team's end zone
(10-yard sector at each end of the field where ail scaling i.s do.ie). Two j
points are awarded the defense for a safety.
A game commences when the referee blows his whistle and one team
kicks off to the other. Alter a kickoff and the receiver of the ball has
been tackled, the team that received the kick i on the offensive and i
given four down, to advance the ball 10 yats.s toward the opposite goal
line, which they do by passing or running.
II they make the yardage thty are given another set of four downs.
This continues until they have scon d or have lost the ball by failing to
make the 10 yards in the four downs, or have fumbled, have had a pass
intercepted, or have puntjJ (kicking without having another player hold
the bail).
DEFENSE BECOMES OFFENSE
When the ball i.s lost on downs the defensive team becomes the offen
sive one and attempts to move'the bail toward the opposite end of the
field.
The usual way to end a down is when a runner is tackled and his knee
touches the ground. When this happens the referee toots his whistle and
another down starts by having the team line up after it forms a huddle
to decide the next play.
The play commences when the ball i.s handed or passed backward by
the center. Downs are also ended by an incomplete pass, loss of down by j
penalty, or running out of bounds with the ball.
