## 
### TOM NEVILLE Editor, Summer Daily 
One week after the June grad
uation ceremonies, Stanford's
1952 summer quarter got under
way for an eight- to ten-week
session. While those who had
just loft headed out into the real
world of job-hunting, vacation
time, and military service, those
who sinyed began adjusting to
the threc-to-one ratio, evenings
in the RBR, and five-unit courses
that met six days a week.
With 112 iur : tudents already in the
Palo Alto Hospital on reg day, Ross
Wilkey, summer ASSU president,
and Meredith Magnus, vice-presi
dent, together with Summer Exoom
made plans for a social program
that started wiih an all-campus
danee at Lagunita and the annual
student-faculty reception.
The reception introduced the vis
iting faculty who came to teach for
the rummer. These men and women
included Pulitzer Prize-winners and
many scholars important in their
field".
A series of .summer conferences
li«V'an the Sit I weekend <if (he

quart"! 1 with the fourteenth an
nual Editors' Conference of the
California Newspaper Publishers'
Association. Other conferences
during the quarter included the
Stanford Conference for Teachers
of English, the eleventh annual
Stanford Business Conference, the
American History Teachers' Con
ference, and several conferences
sponsored by the School of Edu
cation (whose School Planning
La!) was photographed by News
week magazine for an article to
appear soon).
Entertainment on campus, besides
a round of dances, a sports day at
the women's pool, and the usual
dorm functions, was highlighted by
a three-week, sold-out run of "The
Late George Apley." Leo Cj. Car
roll, artist-in-residence for the sum
mer, starred in the leading role and
was supported by a cast of Speech
and Drama Department students.
Carroll also acted the lead in "The
Man Who Woke Up," the second and
final Stanford Players' production of
the quarter.
As the Republicans gathered in
Chicago to pick Dwight D. Eisen
hower as their Presidential candi
date, the University trustees an
nounced plans for a new shopping
center along El Camino between
San Francu quito Creek and the
Palo Alto Hospital. Preliminary

plans are now being drawn up.
Construction of a $241,000 ex
tension of the Microwave Lab
also began during the summer.
Other physical improvements were
widening of the street in front of
the Pavilion, resurfacing of the
Encina - Toyon parking lot, and
rebuilding the boathousc floats.
On Wednesday afternoon, July lfi,
Professor Carl T. Running, associ
ate professor of business law, died
in his office of a heart attack. Pro
fessor Running, noted for his enthu
siastic interest in student affairs and
the popularity of his courses, was
survived by his wife, Mrs. Ruth B.
Running, and a seven - month - old
daughter, Kristin Majage.
Half-way through the summer
Excom passed a resolution reor
ganizing its summer membership.
With graduate students outnum
bering undergradautes in the
same proportion as men stiuVnts
outnumbered the women (three
to one), Excom resolved to give
the Ed Council member (where
most of the grad students arc en
rolled during the summer) a vote
along with the regular graduate
representative. A r.vaduate mem
ber at large still lias no vote under
the new system.
Freshman Don Sanders, first
string defensive halfback on last
fall's football squad, scored 5,399

! points to win the first annual sum
mer Hamburger Decathlon, just af
ter Stanford's Bob Mathias had won
his second straight Olympic victory
in the decathlon. Masterminded by
Roy DefTebach, summer Excom
member, the Hamburger Decathlon
stood out as the major athletic
event of the quarter.
Two days later Meiba Wiser told
I a breathless KZSU audience that
i she was velvet-lunged Stanford Sa
| die. Miss Wiser was currently en-
I rolled in NBC-Stunfcrd Radio-Tele
| vision Institute, which awarded 52
certificates to students at the end
j of the quarter.
In Augu: t Stanford entered n
I long-range plan together with 17
other California colleges and imi—
I versities to prevent possible Coni
| inunist infiltration in• <> California
j school % ' No inference should he
I drawn that there is a sudden cpi-
I deinic of infiltration or that there
' is a critical condition among all
the | ii< ip:'ting institutions,"
j State Senator Wo.rh M. Burns,
j chairman of the legislative com
mittee, said in announcing the
program.
As only a few hundred students
trudged through finals at the end
of the ten-week session, the Uni
versity predicted an enrollment, of
7,250 for the corning fall Quarter.

But there weren't many here to
think about next quarter. Offices
and classrooms emptied, parking
places were once again available in

front of Lagunita, and mail piled up
in dusty P.O. boxes.
Even Herbert Hoover had gone
fishing.
