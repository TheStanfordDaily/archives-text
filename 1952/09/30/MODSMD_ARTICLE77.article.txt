# The
						Fabulous "500"— And How They Grew
## Coed Quota Set Scene for Ratio 
### 
[ "The number ci women at
tending the University as stu
! dents shall at no time cxceed
1 500."
So read Mrs. Stanford's 1899
amendment Id the founding
Grant which created the exclu-
I sive "500" and precipitated the
famous ratio. The amendment
also cost the University both in
, come and goodwill for turning
down 80 per cent of its women
! applicants, while the word
spread that Stanford women
' possessed abnormally high IQ's
j (and not much else).
But non? of these things were
foreseen in 1899. Mrs. Stanford had
1 already used most of her personal
income to keep the University open
j while the Stanford estate went
through the courts. Stretching her
fundi equally for men and women
did not seem possible, especially
j since the University was founded in
memory of her'only son.
Women Included
However, both Stanfords felt that
J education for women was just as
important us for men. A report
-1 er, inquiring whether the women of
Stanford carried ou as many honors
| as the men, got a positive answer.
Mrs. Stanford replied, "Indeed
! tiiey do, and I wouldn't have the
feminine element entirely eliminat
ed. . . , Besides, the refining influ
ence of the girls is wonderful."
'I hey Kept Coming
Although women weru welcomed,
neither Stanford thought that a
large number would attend, as the
i University was set up to deal main
ly with science and advanced re
search. In spite of this, more and
more women enrolled.
Quota Reached
The first "500" quota was reached
in 1904, and the University raised
its already high entrance require
rents even higher to reduce the
number of candidates for admission.
But the stack of gilt-edged certifi
cates in the Registrar's office stead
ily increased, while the number of
places stayed constant.
By 1923, there were 550 applica
tions for 78 places, including grad
uate students. In 1925, only one
girl out of five or six hopefuls had
any chance of being accepted, while
the ratio climbed to one woman ta
six men.
Pressure to change the Founding
Grant mounted, but the amendment
seemed impregnable.
Campus Controversy
In 1930, student opinion was re

fleeted in' an editorial written by
the Daily women's editor:
"Mills girls are beautiful, Califor
nia coeds are good dates, UCLA's
femininity are lovely creatures, but
Stanford women have high IQ's.
There is a deep-rooted ancient prej
udice against the Five Hundred,
and although there are always ex
ceptions — that doesn't help the
rule."
A letter in the Daily Campus
Opinion column stated:
"It is often heard that 'imports'
are the pet dates of the Stanford
men. . . . Sour grapes! Of the 3.000
men, how many can rate one of the
'500'?"

The Big.Change
Finally, in 1933, the Trustees
announced that the Founding Grant
had been reinterpreted, and that
women would henceforth be admit
ted in a rough ratio of 55 men to 45
women.
The change was carried out under
the Trustees' obligation to provide
equal facilities to both sexes. Also,
Mrs. Stanford's amendments stated
that any of the founders' amend
ments were "incidental and subor
dinate" to the paramount purpose
of maintaining a University of "high
degree."
Surprising Reaction
However, the revolutionary move
did not create unqualified joy.
Roble women booed; the men re
acted in a similar vein.
The Daily Bull Sessioner be
moaned the Farm's invasion by
women and the subsequent loss of
another, men's school.
Inevitably, student reaction re
versed itself, and ratio rows—2.G: 1
last year— are still part of the Stan
ford scene.
