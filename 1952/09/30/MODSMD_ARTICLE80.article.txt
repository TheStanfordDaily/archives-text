# Sororities? Girl Greeks Axed in '44
## 
### 
Sororicide—that's what Time
magazine called it. The Stan
ford Spectator labeled it tho
Row row, while sorority alum
nae used other names. But it all
added up to the same thing in
1944 when the Board of Trustees
abolished sororities from the
Stanford campus.
At first the famous "500" could
be handled by the ten and later nine
j iororities at Stanford. Bui throng i
I the years, the sororities increasingly
tightened into a group of the : ociu l
i elite. •
Ceiling Lifted
Alter iy:i4, the fiiction intensified
! when the "SOU" ceiling was taken
| oft the number of Stanford women,
and the sororities still took only 250
in all. Alpha Omega Hi, Alpha Phi,
I Chi Omega, Dslta Delta Lklta. Delta
! Gamma, Gamma Plii, Kappa Alpha
Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, an I I'i
Beta Phi could not raise their quo
j tas as the University had done.
Agitation Begins
Agitation for some change in the
system began in 1943. Thirteen IJo -
ble sponsors, including both sorority
and dormitory women wrote to the
Board of Trustees, stating their di:
I satisfaction with the sorority system
at Stanford.
Dr. Kay Lyman Wilbur then ap~
j pointed three women to select their
own committees to study the whole
situation.
Several weeks of extreme feeling
followed the spon or:i' letier. The
anti-sorority motto was: "The wind ;
} of freedom do not blow here" (re
j versing the university motto).
Surprising Decision
The battle cries died away in the
next year. But on a rainy night th •
following April, Dr. Donald B. Tres
idder made a surprising announce
ment to a packed houso of sorority
women in Cubberley Auditorium.
The University president r- it m -
j ated what one of the members of
j the study committee said after sub-
I mitting their proposed plan: "We
| are not here to deny th? advantages
! of sororities in other places but we
| do not believe that the i-yst m is
j suitable to our campus."
Response Spontaneous
After Dr. Tresidder had delivered
j the decision ending the 50-year pe
riod of sorority living at Stanford,
the women rose spontaneously and
| broke into the Stanford Hymn.
Said the president: "We, above
| all, are Stanford women."
