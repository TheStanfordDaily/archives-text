# Women Give Men the Big Heave-Ho; Men's Quarters Are No Longer Secure
## 
### 
Since the building of the first Ro
ble in 1891, the problem of housing
Stanford's women has continued to
harry both the University and the
women themselves.
Even in the beginning, there was
not enough room in Roble. The
"leftovers" lived in sorority houses
and campus residences taken over
by Stanford.
Thus, Madrono and Mariposa
1 were early taken over as auxiliary
; housing units. In 1918, the name
j 'Roble" (meaning white oaks) was
transferred to the newly built wom
en's dorm, while the name "Se
quoia" was given to the original
building for a men's hall.
Witli the disappearance of the
"500" in 1933, the housing problem
became much more acute. Union
was relinquished by men to ea e the
bottleneck and also to provide a
dining room for Madrono, Mariposa,
and Elm.
Plans for building Lagunita went
| ahead, and the first four units of
i this modern dorm were ready in

1934. Casa Ventura was added to
the Lag group in 1939. But the
women were always a jump ahead
of the housing planners, and in 1944,
the men lost another hall—this time,
Branner.
Formerly housed in Manzanita,
graduate women now live in Ster
ling Hall in the Village, Cubberley
Hall located above the Row, or oil'
campus. Representing the last link
in the evolution of women's hou; -
ing, the graduate women in these
dorms enjoy "an adult form of liv
ing" and need abide by no'regula
tions other than the Fundamental
Standard.
In spite of the housing program'-;
expansion, there have always been
off-campus women girls who nm: I
commute for at least one quarter il
they live close enough (o campus.
Even in 1904 there was a room on
Quad reserved as a commuters'
lounge. In 1915, the Women's Club
house was built, and the off-campus
women centered their activities al
the Clubhouse.

Quad reserved as a commuters'
lounge. In 1915, the Women's Club
house was built, and the off-campus
women centered their activities al
the Clubhouse.
Since the building of the first Ro
ble in 1891, the problem of housing
Stanford's women has continued to
harry both the University and the
women themselves.
Even in the beginning, there was
not enough room in Roble. The
"leftovers" lived in sorority houses
and campus residences taken over
by Stanford.
Thus, Madrono and Mariposa
1 were early taken over as auxiliary
; housing units. In 1918, the name
j 'Roble" (meaning white oaks) was
transferred to the newly built wom
en's dorm, while the name "Se
quoia" was given to the original
building for a men's hall.
Witli the disappearance of the
"500" in 1933, the housing problem
became much more acute. Union
was relinquished by men to ea e the
bottleneck and also to provide a
dining room for Madrono, Mariposa,
and Elm.
Plans for building Lagunita went
| ahead, and the first four units of
i this modern dorm were ready in

1934. Casa Ventura was added to
the Lag group in 1939. But the
women were always a jump ahead
of the housing planners, and in 1944,
the men lost another hall—this time,
Branner.
Formerly housed in Manzanita,
graduate women now live in Ster
ling Hall in the Village, Cubberley
Hall located above the Row, or oil'
campus. Representing the last link
in the evolution of women's hou; -
ing, the graduate women in these
dorms enjoy "an adult form of liv
ing" and need abide by no'regula
tions other than the Fundamental
Standard.
In spite of the housing program'-;
expansion, there have always been
off-campus women girls who nm: I
commute for at least one quarter il
they live close enough (o campus.
Even in 1904 there was a room on
Quad reserved as a commuters'
lounge. In 1915, the Women's Club
house was built, and the off-campus
women centered their activities al
the Clubhouse.
