## Law 
### 
From a small class in one of the
University's original departments tc
professional school status in 11)24 to
a new $1,000.(100 plant in 1950 thus
the Stanford Law School has pro
gressed.
Throughout its history the school
has operated on a policy of limit
ing enrollment, and the selected
students thus graduating consist
ently lead the state in percentage
of men passing the bar exam.
A top-notch faculty has been tin
chief selling point of the schoo'
since the days long before the new
building, ami regular additions to
the faculty of outstanding men
maintain its high quality.
The.e two characteristics, along
with the large library, have com
bined to make Stanford one of the
top law schools in the nation.
The law school building was given
to Stanford as a library by Thomas
Weltun Stanford in IH9H and con
verted in I'.lltt into an administra
tion building.
In 1945 and l!)4(i, a group of
alumni, through the Stanford Law
Societies, initiated a program for
the support of the law school that
has since been known as the Stan
ford Law School Plan.
Developed by the school faculty,
alumni, and University administra
tion, the plan produced the fund
raising which resulted in li) 48 in the
start of reconstruction ol the out
moded and overcrowded l 'Ad"
building into the present law school.
The new quarters were dedicated
in July 1950, with Supreme Court
Associate Justice Robert H. Jackson
delivering the major address.
Concurrent with the law schoo!
building program has been the do
nation by Judfe George E. Crothers
of Crothers Hall, a law students'
dormitory.


NEW BUILDING FROM OLD When Stanford contracted with
Wagner and Martinez to construct new Law School facilities
within the shell of the old Administration Building, the cost was
little more than one-third of the $2,500,000 that an entirely new
building would have cost.
