Although it has the dubious dis
tinction of being the only school o!
its type in the country out ide oi
Hahvahd, Stanford's Graduate
School of Business boast-, one of the
strongest groups of students on
campus.
There is a consistent demand from
industrial and other commercial
firms for its 150 or so gxaduates per
year. ___
And well might there be so, for
the list of company contributors to
the initial development of the
school compares favorably with al

most any listing of blue chip stocks.
Business had a need for profes
sionally trained men to stall its
management and sales arms as well
as its technical arm. Discussion
about a graduate business school
had been under way in the Univer
sity for several years.
But it remained for Herbert Hoo
ver, a University trustee, to bring
the need for financial support to the
attention of interested Pacific Coast
businessmen.
A committee was formed, funds
raised, and the school was able to
open to students in the autumn of
1525.
Since then the school has consist
ently increased in size and esteem,
and cemented an ever closer asso
ciation with business to more effec
tively accomplish its purpose.
A couple of the modern develop
ments have been consulting profes
sorships to which selected business
men have been appointed and the
several special rummer programs
now being carried on.
