# Construction, Quake, Great President Highlight First Quarter Century
## 
### 

1. THE CAUSE OF IT ALL—A most promising young man, Le
)and Stanford, Jr., died of a fever in Florence, Italy, while travel
ing abroad with his parents shortly before he was to have en
tered'college. As a memorial to the aspirations thoy had for
their son, his parents conceived the plan for a unique institution
of higher education in the Far West, Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity.


2. AND SO IT WAS BUlLT—Designed in massive sandstone, the first buildings were not yet
wholly finished when-the new University openad its doors to students in the fall of 1891. The
initial construction centered on Inner Quad and also included the first engineering lab build
ing, complete with a tall smokestack which later fell down in the earthquake.


3. COLORFUL CORNER
STONE CEREMONY—On May
15, 1839, a large group of people
gathered to watch Senator and
Mrs. Stanford lay the corner
< jgl

stone for what was to become
one of the nation's greatest uni
versities. By looking closely,
the Stanfords can be made out
in the center of the picture.


4. HE MADE THE MONEY—It
required a considerable sum of
money to establish a university;
aiid Senator Stanford, one of the

pioneer railroad builders of the
West, accumulated a large es
tate during his lifetime. Virtu
ally all of it was eventually used
for the building and endowment
of fhc school.


5. EARLY QUAD—This rare old photo pictures the Quad in 1300, looking west toward the re
cently torn down Sequoia—then the first Roble Hall. The unusual looking contraption on the left
leads one to believe that the tradition regarding no bicycles cn Quad had not then been estab
lished.


I 6. AND THEN IT FELL DOWN
| —The famous earthquake of
j 1306 dealt nearly a mortal blow
to the young Stanford Univer
sity. Among the structures shat
tered were the huge triumphal
arch at the entrance to Memorial
Court and, in the back ground of
the photo, the Church. Of the
arch, which was never rebuilt,
1 only the pedestals remain to-
I day.

2. AND SO IT WAS BUlLT—Designed in massive sandstone, the first buildings were not yet
wholly finished when-the new University openad its doors to students in the fall of 1891. The
initial construction centered on Inner Quad and also included the first engineering lab build
ing, complete with a tall smokestack which later fell down in the earthquake.

STONE CEREMONY—On May
15, 1839, a large group of people
gathered to watch Senator and
Mrs. Stanford lay the corner
< jgl

stone for what was to become
one of the nation's greatest uni
versities. By looking closely,
the Stanfords can be made out
in the center of the picture.


4. HE MADE THE MONEY—It
required a considerable sum of
money to establish a university;
aiid Senator Stanford, one of the

pioneer railroad builders of the
West, accumulated a large es
tate during his lifetime. Virtu
ally all of it was eventually used
for the building and endowment
of fhc school.


5. EARLY QUAD—This rare old photo pictures the Quad in 1300, looking west toward the re
cently torn down Sequoia—then the first Roble Hall. The unusual looking contraption on the left
leads one to believe that the tradition regarding no bicycles cn Quad had not then been estab
lished.


I 6. AND THEN IT FELL DOWN
| —The famous earthquake of
j 1306 dealt nearly a mortal blow
to the young Stanford Univer
sity. Among the structures shat
tered were the huge triumphal
arch at the entrance to Memorial
Court and, in the back ground of
the photo, the Church. Of the
arch, which was never rebuilt,

west from Ohio by Senator Stan
' Eord, served as president from
Stanford's opening on Oct. 1,
1891, to May 23, 1913, and then
retired to the position of chan

biology building which bears '
his name) and for his work in j
developing and shaping the i
course of higher education (as
one of Hip figures in the frieze
on Cubberley Library which is !
composed of 24 of the great men j
in the history of education).

1. THE CAUSE OF IT ALL—A most promising young man, Le
)and Stanford, Jr., died of a fever in Florence, Italy, while travel
ing abroad with his parents shortly before he was to have en
tered'college. As a memorial to the aspirations thoy had for
their son, his parents conceived the plan for a unique institution
of higher education in the Far West, Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity.
