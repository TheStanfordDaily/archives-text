term ended with the inauguration of Dr. Wilbur. Branner Hall
is named for him.


13. THE PAJAMARINO —as the name implies, a pajama-clad freshman parade, serenade, rally,
and dance customarily held on Thursday night preceding the SC game—is one of many glorious
Stanford traditions which have now been relegated to the pages of history.


16. STANFORD LOOKS TO THE FUTURE—Sin~e the close of the war, Stanford has been em- S
barked on a great program of modernization an*] expansion of its facilities, a program that is still I
being continued under the guidance of the University's Planning Commission. Part of the pro- j
gram includes the rebuilding of Inner Quad shown above.


9. LONGEST IN OFFICE—Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, taking office
on Jan. 1, 1916, served as president ufttil Aug. 31, 1943, when he
retired to chancellor emeritus, which position he held until his
death in June, 1949. The third of his grandsons to attend Stan
ford is a freshman this fall quarter.


14. THROUGH THE WAR
YEARS — Dr. Donald B. Tresid
der took over as president on
Dr. Wilbur's retirement and
guided the University through
the difficult years until his un
timely death, Jan. 28, 1948.


17. CURRENT LEADER — After
serving on Stanford's History
Department staff in the 'thirties,

I turned to the University as its
| fifth president in early 1949. His
i colorful formal inauguration
was held on Oct. 7, 1949.


10. "SO THE MOVING FINGER WRITES"—One of the earliest
and thus far most successful institutions of ils kind, the Honor
Code was initiated by the student body in 1923. The Code and
the Fundamental Standard form dual cornerstones for the phi
losophy of life at Stanford.


12. IN DAYS GONE BY—Registration is tedious? Hah! You
should have been here in the days preceding pre-"reging." The
lines and class card trading then resembling a cross between
the Rose Bowl general admission line and the pit of the New
York Stock Exchange.


11. TRADITIONAL RlVALRY—lntroduced in 1899 by yell lead
er Billy Erb to boost spirit, the famous Stanford Axe was fought
over with Cal, stolen and restolen by the Bears and the Indians,
and finally retired in 1933 to the rather dignified position as per
petual trophy for the winner of the Big Game.


15. GRAND OLD GRAD—Herbert Hoover, '95, Stanford's most
illustrious alumnus, parlayed his civil engineering education
and political and humanitarian interests into a career which
ranks him as one of the Greatest American men of the twentieth
