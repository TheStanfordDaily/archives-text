### 
BATTLEGROUNDS â€”Throughout the year the facilities pictured
above are the stages for athletic competition between Stanford
and visiting foes: Encina Pool, which is normally just for men,
was used by Sharon Geary, Stanford swim star, as she got in
sorrfe lessons under Stanford Coach Tom Haynie before leaving
for the recent Olympics. The pool is used for all swim meets
and water polo games. The Pavilion, pictured at the top, was
built in 1922 when students voluntarily added a dollar to each
quarter's tuition. The site of all home basketball games, the
Pavilion seats 2,700. And below, the massive stadium, seating
90,000, also ijuilt in 1922, is where the Indians take the warpath
on fall Saturdays. Thejstadium also houses track meets and an
occasional rugby game during the spring.
