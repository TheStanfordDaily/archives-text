# Farm Boasts Complete Modern Athletic Plant
## You Want Exercise? 
### 
Life at Stanford is a varied
I one, and while study is the para
mount occupation, it is not the
I only one. Farm students have
, available to them one of the fin
est and most modern athletic
: plants in America, and therefore
sports are much in evidei"> the
year around. A majority of the
facilities are available to all stu
dents, not only athletes.
With fall come Saturday trips
| to (he huge Stanford Stadium to
| watch the Big Red in action. With
a capacity of 90,000, this howl is
j the second largest university sta
i ilium in America. Surrounding
j the beautiful playing field is a
quarter - mile track with a 220-
I yard straight-away which is used
for track meets in the spring.
Just outside the stadium is An
i gel 1 Field, with a track which was
i completely rebuilt recently and is
: without an equal on the Pacific
' Angell Field is used for
j (raining, is the site of the annual
! intramural track meet, and may be
used by anyone "working out."
Perhaps the most impressive sin
gle part of Stanford's athletic layout
is the Stanford goll course, a pic
turesque, 18-hole course which oc
cupies about 200 acres and is avail-
I able for student play at low rates.
.Stanfc.vd officials rarely brag
about (he seating capacity of the
Stanford Pavilion, which is 2,700
(around .'{,((00 squeeze in for con
ference games), but the playing
| flooK itself is one of the best. Ail
! jacent (o the court are located a
we;,flu lifting room and mats for
wrestling.
The center of activity for men is
Encina Gymnasium, which contains
a huge basketball court and facili
ties for boxing, gymnastics, fencing,
and handball.
Outside are located three swim
ming pools, where water polo games
and swim meets are Jield. There is
also a women's pool adjacent to the
Women's Gymnasium and athletic
field. ' ,
One more 'Stanford "best" is the
fabulous Sunken Diamond, which is
considered America's finest college
baseball park; in fact the Detroit
Tigers trained here in 1935. The
fences are 350 feet down the line,
making home runs few and far be
tween. I
Other units in the, athletic plant
: include four football fields, 1!)
tennis courts, one soccer field, a
polo field, several intramural
i fields, horseshoe pits, volleyball
courts, and nine other baseball
diamonds, all for student enjoy

Intramurals hold a major spot in
campus doings with all men's living
groups entering the competition
which includes football and table
tennis and just about all the sports
in between.
