# Book Trade Continues Today in Back of Libe
## 
### 
With more than $350 in book .sale
yesterday, Alpha Phi Omega decided
to hold the A Phi O Book Exchange
open on extra afternoon this week
tomorrow —in addition to today's
I regular hours of 9 to 12 in the morn
ing and 1 to 4 in the afternoon in
the southwest corner of Temporary
Building A.
The response of students yesterday
led to the change in plans, and the
decision by the service fraternity to
hold the Exchange open tomorrow
afternoon from 1 to 4.
The chairman of the Exchange,
Dud Herschbach, said that this will
still give students time to leave their
books today and have them sold. He
encouraged students to utilize the
Exchange in order to make it a suc
cessful project.
Herschbach also said that there is
a great demand for lower division
' text books, especially the Tarshis
economics text and Ruch, "Psychol
ogy in Life." These books, reported
the chairman, have about two cus
tomers for every one seller.
In general, Herschbach said, there
j are more buyers than books. Yester
j day 200 books passed through the
I Exchange, and approximately 120 are
on the shelves yet to sell.
The handling charge for each book
[ sold through the Exchange is 10
cents, to cover material costs of the
j Exchange. Any profits gained from
! the Exchange will be applied to cam
j pus service projects of Alpha Phi
I Omega.
