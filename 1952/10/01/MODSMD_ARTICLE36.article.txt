# Our Goal: a Golden Mean
## 
### 
A golden mean is The Daily's goal this vol
ume.
We will be working for balance balance
between different kinds of campus news and
between news of Stanford and of the world
outside.
We fully realize our place in intra-campus
communication, and wo will try to do a good
job of covering Stanford. But space limitations
keep us from printing long stories on every
campus event —even if we wanted to. So we
have to decide how important each story is
and treat it accordingly. One of our main cri
teria is how many people are affected. This
means the Colored Slide Society's weekly
meeting won't get as much attention as an all
campus event.
But although we don't want to neglect cam
pus news, we feel we would be doing you, our
reader, a disservice if we were to ignore na
tional and international news. Trite but true,
Stanford is very much an ivory tower, a little
world of its own. We want to let you know
what's going on outside that tower.
Politically, we'll work for balance, too. Ev
ery effort will be made to keep our news col
umns as objective as possible and to save the
partisan viewpoints for the editorial column.

The Daily as a whole will not take sides in
the current Presidential campaign, since we
are published by a student body of diversified
opinion. However, we feel that excluding par
tisan viewpoints from the paper would be un
realistic.
This is what we plan lo do: Daily editorial
board members will write political editorials
reflecting their own varying points of view. All
political editorials will be signed and can be
assumed to represent the opinions of the writ
er, not The Daily as a whole.
About non-political editorials: those written
by the editor will not be signed; others will be
signed by Daily editorial board members.
If you feel political balance is lacking on our
editorial page—or if you have any other ideas
to air—please do something about it in the
"Campus Opinion" column. We welcome your
comments, but reserve the right to cut letters
more than 100 words long. Unsigned letters
will not be printed, but names may be withheld
by request.
The Daily is your paper. If you think we're
doing something wrong, come hear our side
of the story. Our motto for this volume is
"Bigger and Better Dailies." With your help,
we'll succeed.

This is what we plan lo do: Daily editorial
board members will write political editorials
reflecting their own varying points of view. All
political editorials will be signed and can be
assumed to represent the opinions of the writ
er, not The Daily as a whole.
About non-political editorials: those written
by the editor will not be signed; others will be
signed by Daily editorial board members.
If you feel political balance is lacking on our
editorial page—or if you have any other ideas
to air—please do something about it in the
"Campus Opinion" column. We welcome your
comments, but reserve the right to cut letters
more than 100 words long. Unsigned letters
will not be printed, but names may be withheld
by request.
The Daily is your paper. If you think we're
doing something wrong, come hear our side
of the story. Our motto for this volume is
"Bigger and Better Dailies." With your help,
we'll succeed.
A golden mean is The Daily's goal this vol
ume.
We will be working for balance balance
between different kinds of campus news and
between news of Stanford and of the world
outside.
We fully realize our place in intra-campus
communication, and wo will try to do a good
job of covering Stanford. But space limitations
keep us from printing long stories on every
campus event —even if we wanted to. So we
have to decide how important each story is
and treat it accordingly. One of our main cri
teria is how many people are affected. This
means the Colored Slide Society's weekly
meeting won't get as much attention as an all
campus event.
But although we don't want to neglect cam
pus news, we feel we would be doing you, our
reader, a disservice if we were to ignore na
tional and international news. Trite but true,
Stanford is very much an ivory tower, a little
world of its own. We want to let you know
what's going on outside that tower.
Politically, we'll work for balance, too. Ev
ery effort will be made to keep our news col
umns as objective as possible and to save the
partisan viewpoints for the editorial column.

The Daily as a whole will not take sides in
the current Presidential campaign, since we
are published by a student body of diversified
opinion. However, we feel that excluding par
tisan viewpoints from the paper would be un
realistic.
