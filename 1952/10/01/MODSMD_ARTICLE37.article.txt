Jurt after the graduation exercises had concluded
hi i spring, a black-robed senior turned to a friend
and said, "You know, I just can't believe it. I can't
believe that I'm not coming back to school nexL fall.
As long as I can remember, I got out of school for
summer and then returned in the fall. Ii just doesn't
.• '•(■m possible that I won't be sitting in a classroom
next lull. And what's more, I've never really appre
ciated the old Farm until just this moment . . .
when I realize that I won't come back."
It was that sudden. One moment he was drinking
c iflfpe at the Cellar, taking notes in class, going to

dances. The next moment he un
believingly was holding a diploma
in his hand, trying to convince
himself that it was all over.
Thei e';3 a lesson to be learned
here. Not until it's all over, do
\.' realize that our college years
ait' the most precious in our life.
I Jut until we are faced with the
pro::pect of going into'the A;my
or spending the rest of our lives
in a noisy office with two weeks'

vacation a year, do we appreciate the comparative
lack ot responsibility that with college years.
T!it' point I'm laboring toward, then, is this: appre
ciate Stanford to the hilt while you're ;:till here. In
tin* words of Rudyard Kipling, "Give every minute
L 0 • econds' worth of long-distancs run."
