# HELSINKI POST MORTEM

A new type of coaching was inaugurated by Cart!
track mentor Jack Weiershauser at the Olympics.
Bob Mathias was trying for a world's record in
the c'ecathlon. To shatter the mark, he needed to
do his all-time best in tlif javelin. His two
throws fell far short of his previous mark, and in
i ! ir- stands Weiershauter groaned inaudibly, "Follow
through, Boh."

Then an idea came to the dapper track coach.
"Listen," he exclaimed, "why don't we give a yell
relaying some coaching strategy?" With that, Weiers
hauser, four Stanford students, Dean Winbigler,
and many assorted well - wishers hollered, "Follow
through, Bob!"
Mathias turned, smiled, and shouted back, "Okay,
Coach."
On his third and last attempt, Mathias winged the
spear li,' 4 feet mto the gray Helsinki sky for his
all-time best and went on to claim the world record.

Dick Weismann, the people's choice, was sitting
in the ASSU president's office one evening last week.
Suddenly, he heard a squeaky sound. He opened
the door, discovered a Paly High student taking the
"ASSU PRESIDENT" sign off the door with a screw
driver.
"Holy cats!" screamed the bug-eyed souvenir
hunter. He handed the screwdriver to the dumb
founded Weismann and raced out, never to be seen
again.

A minor tragedy was averted lust Friday. The
Stanford football team had worked out at the
Washington State field, and then had returned to
its hotel in Moscow, Idaho. Whereupon captain AI
Kirklancl informed the horrified coaching staff, "I
left my plays in the Washington State dressing
room."
"Horrors!" shouted backfield coach George Lynn,
clapping a hand to his head. "We'll be ruined if
they get those plays."
and Kirkland jumped into a Buick, broke
every speed law in the books in getting back to
Pullman, raced into the dressing room, and dis
covered the WSC athletic manager on the verge
of getting to the plays, which were on the floor.
Kirkland scooped them up, kissed the sheets of
paper, and nervously explained, "They're my home
work."
