## Some Think It's Magic, Others Know It's the 'T'

Although football came to the United States with the Pilgrims, it didn't
hit the Stanford campus until an enterprising youth, named Herbert Hoo
ver, organized a team and acted as manager in the year 1892. And with
a few years out for rugby competition and a complete lapse during the
Second World War, Stanford has been playing football ever since.
Before we get too deep into our subject, the T formation, let it be
known that Stanford has a football record to be proud of. Down through
the yeara, the Indians have played 518 games, have won 310 of them
while losing 130, and 38 have resulted in ties. And a look at the scoring
Shows that on the whole Stanford has outscored its collective opponents
close to three to one.

Enough of that. Now let's talk of the deceptive, magic-like T forma
tion which you will see Stanford use against Michigan this Saturday, end
against all opponents this season. Stanford gave a rebirth to the T forma
tion in 1940 when under Coach Clark the Cards went un
defeated including a Rose Bowl win.
Since that year the T formation has spread to every part of the coun
try and to almost every high school, college, and prof«?:.:;ional team. How
ever, lho trend now is shifting away from the T.

QUARTERBACK IS THE KEY
Necessary personnel for the T, which does resemble a T as the diagram
show?, includes a smart quarterback who is a good passer and h..s the
ability to fake the ball in order to deceive the defensive team into going
altar the wrong ball carrier.
There should be a fast but powerful fullback (F in the diagram) who
will take advantage of the quickness and deception of the T. And the
hall backs (H in- the diagram) must be both good runners and pass re
ceivers to utilize the full benefits of the T.
The quarterback (shown in the diagram as Q) must be a master of
deception as he handles the ball on every play with tiie exception of a
kickiiij', •' ituation. Always Keep your eyes on the quarterback in order
to follow tlic* ball.
As a play starts the quarterback takes the ball directly from the
hands ol the center (C in the diagram) and spins around taking a lew
Eteps toward his own baekfield. Then starts a series of slight-of-hand
mbtions that would make unv magician envious.
MANY PLAYS POSSIBLE
The quarterback may fake to one back and give the bail to another.
Jle may feive the ball first and then fake or he may fake twice or three
times and finally toss or pitch the ball out to a back who has started
v/ide around end. Or he may keep the ball himself, and pass or run. The
number ol plays possible from the T formation is unlimited.
Originally the T formation, to be most efiective, used a man in motion,
that is, while the team was lined up waiting for the play to start, a half
back started running parallel with the line. This spread the defense and
set. up an entire new potential of plays. However, Stanford, when hoping
to spread the defense, breaks from the huddle and lines up with a half
hack, fullback, or end way out wide. The man in motion is used
sparingly.
In the T formation the blocking of the offensive team is brush-block
ing more than making sure that the man is knocked down. This is be
cause the T operates so rapidly that a brush block which clears the
delen.-ive man aside just for the instant it takes the ball carrier to get
by doe n't require the blocker always to leave his feet, thereby giving
him a chance to knock down another man farther down field.
PLATOON FOOTBALL
A recent innovation in football is the platoon system of play. As the
ball goes from defense to offense or offense to defense, teams will sub
stitute almost 11 men each time. This permits the men better suited for
offense to play offense, and those more able on defense to play defense.
Some players play both defense and offense, and at Stanford this is often
the case because of lack of reserves.
To sum up, the T is a lightning-quick offense which emphasizes speed
and deception rather than power. The key man is the quarterback.

Originally the T formation, to be most efiective, used a man in motion,
that is, while the team was lined up waiting for the play to start, a half
back started running parallel with the line. This spread the defense and
set. up an entire new potential of plays. However, Stanford, when hoping
to spread the defense, breaks from the huddle and lines up with a half
hack, fullback, or end way out wide. The man in motion is used
sparingly.
In the T formation the blocking of the offensive team is brush-block
ing more than making sure that the man is knocked down. This is be
cause the T operates so rapidly that a brush block which clears the
delen.-ive man aside just for the instant it takes the ball carrier to get
by doe n't require the blocker always to leave his feet, thereby giving
him a chance to knock down another man farther down field.
PLATOON FOOTBALL
A recent innovation in football is the platoon system of play. As the
ball goes from defense to offense or offense to defense, teams will sub
stitute almost 11 men each time. This permits the men better suited for
offense to play offense, and those more able on defense to play defense.
Some players play both defense and offense, and at Stanford this is often
the case because of lack of reserves.
To sum up, the T is a lightning-quick offense which emphasizes speed
and deception rather than power. The key man is the quarterback.

Although football came to the United States with the Pilgrims, it didn't
hit the Stanford campus until an enterprising youth, named Herbert Hoo
ver, organized a team and acted as manager in the year 1892. And with
a few years out for rugby competition and a complete lapse during the
Second World War, Stanford has been playing football ever since.
Before we get too deep into our subject, the T formation, let it be
known that Stanford has a football record to be proud of. Down through
the yeara, the Indians have played 518 games, have won 310 of them
while losing 130, and 38 have resulted in ties. And a look at the scoring
Shows that on the whole Stanford has outscored its collective opponents
close to three to one.
PARTY AT STANFORD
Enough of that. Now let's talk of the deceptive, magic-like T forma
tion which you will see Stanford use against Michigan this Saturday, end
against all opponents this season. Stanford gave a rebirth to the T forma
tion in 1940 when under Coach Clark the Cards went un
defeated including a Rose Bowl win.
Since that year the T formation has spread to every part of the coun
try and to almost every high school, college, and prof«?:.:;ional team. How
ever, lho trend now is shifting away from the T.
The T formation looks like this to the defense:

QUARTERBACK IS THE KEY
Necessary personnel for the T, which does resemble a T as the diagram
show?, includes a smart quarterback who is a good passer and h..s the
ability to fake the ball in order to deceive the defensive team into going
altar the wrong ball carrier.
There should be a fast but powerful fullback (F in the diagram) who
will take advantage of the quickness and deception of the T. And the
hall backs (H in- the diagram) must be both good runners and pass re
ceivers to utilize the full benefits of the T.
The quarterback (shown in the diagram as Q) must be a master of
deception as he handles the ball on every play with tiie exception of a
kickiiij', •' ituation. Always Keep your eyes on the quarterback in order
to follow tlic* ball.
As a play starts the quarterback takes the ball directly from the
hands ol the center (C in the diagram) and spins around taking a lew
Eteps toward his own baekfield. Then starts a series of slight-of-hand
mbtions that would make unv magician envious.
MANY PLAYS POSSIBLE
The quarterback may fake to one back and give the bail to another.
Jle may feive the ball first and then fake or he may fake twice or three
times and finally toss or pitch the ball out to a back who has started
v/ide around end. Or he may keep the ball himself, and pass or run. The
number ol plays possible from the T formation is unlimited.
Originally the T formation, to be most efiective, used a man in motion,
that is, while the team was lined up waiting for the play to start, a half
back started running parallel with the line. This spread the defense and
set. up an entire new potential of plays. However, Stanford, when hoping
to spread the defense, breaks from the huddle and lines up with a half
hack, fullback, or end way out wide. The man in motion is used
sparingly.
In the T formation the blocking of the offensive team is brush-block
ing more than making sure that the man is knocked down. This is be
cause the T operates so rapidly that a brush block which clears the
delen.-ive man aside just for the instant it takes the ball carrier to get
by doe n't require the blocker always to leave his feet, thereby giving
him a chance to knock down another man farther down field.
PLATOON FOOTBALL
A recent innovation in football is the platoon system of play. As the
ball goes from defense to offense or offense to defense, teams will sub
stitute almost 11 men each time. This permits the men better suited for
offense to play offense, and those more able on defense to play defense.
Some players play both defense and offense, and at Stanford this is often
the case because of lack of reserves.
To sum up, the T is a lightning-quick offense which emphasizes speed
and deception rather than power. The key man is the quarterback.
