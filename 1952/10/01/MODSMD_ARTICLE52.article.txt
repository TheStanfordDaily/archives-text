# Series Opener Televised Here
## Black, Reynolds Slated To Hurl Today; Yanks Favored 
### MIKE HUDSON 
The fir t game.* ol' the Dodger-Yan
kee World Series battle will begin
today at 10 a.m., Pacific Time. Lo
cal fans may view the games over
KRON-TV, channel 4. Sets will be
on at Stern, Toyori, Rossotti's, and
many of the fraternities.
Yank Manager Casey Stengel has
nominated veteran Allie Reynolds
(20-8) to pitch today's opener, with
his other two aces, Vic Racchi and
EJdie Lopat, scheduled to hurl to
morrow and Friday. Dodger mentor
Chuck Dressen, in a surprise move
has named rookie relief ace Joe
Black (15-4) to oppose Reynolds. If
Black should the Dodgers will
be in desperate straits, for Dressen
has only sore-armed Carl Erskine
and sorer-armed Preacher Roe as
future starters. Furthermore, with
Black pitching the opener and per
haps the fourth game, the Dodgers
must pray that one of a crew of
mediocre reliefers can stop the Yan
kees, should their famed five o'clock
lightning strike Roe or Erskine.
Strong Defenses
Aside from pitching, the teams
shape up evenly. Both clubs are
strong defensively. The Yanks led
the majors with 198 double plays,
while the Dodgers committed only
100 miscues all season to compile a
record .982 fielding mark.
The team; are about even at the
plate also. The Dodgers banged the
ball at a .202 ppce and banged out
153 home runs, while the Yanks hit
.2GG and had 129 round-trippers.
The New Yorkers will be trying
for their fourth straight world
championship. Only one other team
has ever won four straight titles,
the Yankees of the 1930-39 era.
That team featured such all-time
greats as Joe DiMaggio, Bill Dickey,
Lou Gehrig, Lefty Gomez, and the
rest of the Bronx Bombers. It's hard
to see how the present Yankee crew
has managed to equal their record.
The secret may lie in Reynolds,
Raschi, and Lopat, three great
pitchers who have won 295 games
for the Yankees at almost a .700
clip. The Dodgers have shown a
marked inability to defeat the Na
tional League's best pitchers, Sal
Maglie and Robin Roberts, and it's
difficult to see how they can do
much better against the three Yank
aces.
The Dodgers have throe .300 hit
ters: Jack Robinson, .308; Duke
Snider, .303; and George Shuba,
.305. The Yanks' lending stickers are
Mickey Mantle and Gene Woodling,
both hitting .311.
Possible Upset
On the other side of the ledger,
the Dodgers have never won a

World Series and the present crew
of sluggers are capable of beating
anyone. If one of such in-and-out
pitchers as Billy Loes, Ralph Bran
ca, and Ben Wade comes through,
the Dodgers might upset the dope.
Neither manager has announced
his starting lineup yet, but they
might line up something like this:
NEW YORK BROOKLYN
Martin . 207 Cox .257
Rizv.uto .25:5 Reese .272

The fir t game.* ol' the Dodger-Yan
kee World Series battle will begin
today at 10 a.m., Pacific Time. Lo
cal fans may view the games over
KRON-TV, channel 4. Sets will be
on at Stern, Toyori, Rossotti's, and
many of the fraternities.
Yank Manager Casey Stengel has
nominated veteran Allie Reynolds
(20-8) to pitch today's opener, with
his other two aces, Vic Racchi and
EJdie Lopat, scheduled to hurl to
morrow and Friday. Dodger mentor
Chuck Dressen, in a surprise move
has named rookie relief ace Joe
Black (15-4) to oppose Reynolds. If
Black should the Dodgers will
be in desperate straits, for Dressen
has only sore-armed Carl Erskine
and sorer-armed Preacher Roe as
future starters. Furthermore, with
Black pitching the opener and per
haps the fourth game, the Dodgers
must pray that one of a crew of
mediocre reliefers can stop the Yan
kees, should their famed five o'clock
lightning strike Roe or Erskine.
Strong Defenses
Aside from pitching, the teams
shape up evenly. Both clubs are
strong defensively. The Yanks led
the majors with 198 double plays,
while the Dodgers committed only
100 miscues all season to compile a
record .982 fielding mark.
The team; are about even at the
plate also. The Dodgers banged the
ball at a .202 ppce and banged out
153 home runs, while the Yanks hit
.2GG and had 129 round-trippers.
The New Yorkers will be trying
for their fourth straight world
championship. Only one other team
has ever won four straight titles,
the Yankees of the 1930-39 era.
That team featured such all-time
greats as Joe DiMaggio, Bill Dickey,
Lou Gehrig, Lefty Gomez, and the
rest of the Bronx Bombers. It's hard
to see how the present Yankee crew
has managed to equal their record.
The secret may lie in Reynolds,
Raschi, and Lopat, three great
pitchers who have won 295 games
for the Yankees at almost a .700
clip. The Dodgers have shown a
marked inability to defeat the Na
tional League's best pitchers, Sal
Maglie and Robin Roberts, and it's
difficult to see how they can do
much better against the three Yank
aces.
The Dodgers have throe .300 hit
ters: Jack Robinson, .308; Duke
Snider, .303; and George Shuba,
.305. The Yanks' lending stickers are
Mickey Mantle and Gene Woodling,
both hitting .311.
Possible Upset
On the other side of the ledger,
the Dodgers have never won a

World Series and the present crew
of sluggers are capable of beating
anyone. If one of such in-and-out
pitchers as Billy Loes, Ralph Bran
ca, and Ben Wade comes through,
the Dodgers might upset the dope.
Neither manager has announced
his starting lineup yet, but they
might line up something like this:
NEW YORK BROOKLYN
