## 
### CONSTANCE GOMPERTS 
"There is an acute need for a
journal to give an objective ac
count of what is going on in
Latin America."
With these words, Professor
Ronald Hilton states the reason
behind the founding of the His
panic American Report, a publi
cation dedicated to giving real
istic, informative data on current
events in Spain and the Latin
American countries.
Professor Hilton is the director of
the Report, which had its start five
years ago. Today there is a world
wide circulation of the publication,
which is constantly quoted as a
source of information, and is used
as a textbook in Hispanic-American
courses given at such well-known
universities as Pennsylvania, North
western, and Southern California.
The Report is put out once a
month by the Hispanic World Affairs
Seminar, which is sponsored jointly
by the Hispanic American Studies
program and the Hoover Institute
and Library on War, Revolution,
and Peace. The members of this
group work in close collaboration
with the Stanford Advisory Board,
which Is made up of 13 professors,
I representing departments such as
Botany, Geography, Political Sci
ence, and History.

working for M.A.'s and Ph.D.'s.
Many of them are majors in such
varied subjects as business, eco
nomics. and anthropology, hut all
of them wish to concentrate on
the Latin American aspect of
their subject.
These students meet twice a week
to discuss current affairs in Latin
America and Spain. Information for
these discussions is carefully gar
nered from many newspapers and
confidential reports sent from Latin
America.
From these discussions and
wide reading, the students then
compile a report on the news in
each country. The many countries
are divided among them, with, for
example, three students laboring
on the report for Argentina.
When the material has been
written, it is first checked by Pro
fessor Hilton and the editorial staff,
and then double-checked by the
particular member of advisory board
specialists.
Some of the professors on the
board include Graham H. Stuart,
whose country is Chile; Dean Carl
B. Spaeth, who is an export on the
River Plate republics; and Thomas
Bailey, head of the History Depart
ment, who reads the articles about
Puerto Rico.
The essentially acadcmic jour
nal, which is aimed at a highly
specialized field, is published once
a month, and an annual subscrip
tion sells for $:>, nine months for
$2.50. Special rates are obtain
able for group subscriptions.
