# Who Dognapped Hogan? Melanie Wants to Know
## 
### 
"Mclanic" is worried.
Jim Fifcr is worried.
Dewey Hccht is worried.
"Hogan" has scurried.
Mclanic is a dog, and her son Ilogan, also a flog, has been missing
since yesterday morning. Dewey Ileclif and Jim Fifcr (who, incidentally,
arc human beings), are especially concerned with Hogan's absence as he
was born the day they established the American record in the Olympic
trials for the two man scull.
"Hogan" was last seen being abducted into a car in front of the post
ollicc. Anyone who knows his whereabouts should contact "Mclanic"
at DA 3-8967.
She is awfully worried.
