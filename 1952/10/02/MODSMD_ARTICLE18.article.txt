## 
### 
Women's Council members yes
terday clarified the sign-in rules by
explaining that the slip must be
marked with the time at which the
girl is actually signing, pcncil in
hand, rather than the time at which
she entered the residence.
If a girl forgets completely to sign
in she is given an offense, even
though she has come in before the
expiration of her late leave.
If she comes in on time, but for
gets to sign in until after expira
tion of her late leave, she must put
the actual time that she is signine
in on the slip, but fhe may record
the time she entered the residence
under "Special Information." In
cases of this kind, the girl will re
| ceive no violation.
The only exception to the new
ruling is in the case of a line-up at
the sign-in desk.
Because so many of the women
students have partially forgotten
the social regulation, the Council
representatives arc planning a sc
ries of short quizzes to be given to
their living groups. Members of the
Council are available to discuss the
rules with living groups if so de
sired.
Officers of Women's Council, who
may be reached to arrange these
talks, are: Joanne Hixson, president,
Lathrop; Jan Hicks, vice-president,
Storey; and Lola Sullivan, secre
tary, Union.
