### 
EN ROUTE WITH TRUMAN, Oct. 1 (UP)- Eoth Presidential can
didates have indicated agreement to a request to keep the issue
of Communist infiltration of the Central Intelligence Agency out
of the political campaign.
Gen. Bedel Smith, director of the super-secret government se-

curity and intelligence agency, said
that he telephoned Gov. Adlai E.
Stevenson and Dwight D. Eisen
hower yesterday.
He said, "I stated to them it would
be deplorable if the procedure of a
sensitive organization like CIA were
used for political capital at the ex
pense of lowering the efficiency cf
the organization and shaking the
confidence of the public in this and
other executive establishments upon
which any future President of the
United States must inevitably de
pend for accurate and reliable in
formation and guidance."
Smith last Monday said that the
Communists had infiltrated practi
cally every government security
agency including his own.
