A couple of somewhat conflicting statements
cro to be found in whistle-sicp speeches Presi
dent Truman made Tuesday while campaign
ing for Governor Stevenson.
First at Harve, Montana, the honorable Presi
dent said that Eisenhower's views as command
ing general in Europe left this country unaware
of Russia's threat to world peace.
Later at Glasgow, in the same state, he re
marked, . . but 1 liked him (Ike) as command
ing general of the armed forces in France."
Permit the absurd assumption that Mr. Tru
man's first statement is correct. Seemingly, the
President proceeds to substantiate Republican
charges that the present administration is built

on a foundation of tragic blunders regarding
the threat of Russian Communism.
A far wiser course for both the President and
those urging the Republican ticket would be to
admit that during the second World War and
the years immediately following virtually the
entire country was suffering from the then rea
sonable delusion that Russia was a friendly and
peaceful ally.
Thus the political campaigners would be
heeding the intelligent plea of Governor Ste
venson, when lie said last Saturday, . . ad
mit our common mistakes and get on with our
(constructive) business." (Parentheses are the
