# The
						Independent Life

### 
On this campus, you're on your own.. Thanks
to uniquely liberal regulations, you alone de
cide whether to stay out until 10 or until 2;
whether to do the assignment or let it slide;
whether to eat dinner or take a nap; whether to
cut that class or go to it. At Stanford, the stu
dent—not the University—makes all personal
decisions.
This adult treatment is an innate part of the
Farm formula. Each freshman is admitted for
his capabilities not only in scholarship, but also
for leadership. It is taken for granted that such
students are able to regulate their own lives —
both academically and socially. Thus, Stan
fcrdites are not required to attend compulsory
study tables or observe strict rules on week
night dating. The balance of studies, going out,
and extra-curricular activities is determined
solely by the individual.

Last spring, Stanford's realistic relationship
between Administration and student body was
duly commended at a meeting of the Pacific
Student Body President's Association, attended
by 118 Western colleges* Speaking informally
to Dick Weismann, many of the PSBPA repre
sentatives admired Stanford's liberal social reg
ulations, noting that the Stanford plan proved
far more workable than the more restrictive late
leave systems endured by other schools.
For most freshmen, this independence is a
new and gratifying experience. For most upper
classmen, it is an old story —perhaps not ap
preciated until an envious colleague from an
other school brings it up. But for all of us, it is
one of Stanford's most outstanding advantages,
and being worthy of such respect is one of our
primary obligations.—Mary Massey
