### SAM FRESHMAN 
Being a candidate for numerous political offices I
fcol that I owe it to the public to make a financial
statement at this.time. At the present moment 1 do
r.ot own a home either in California or Washington,
D.C., do nol have a deep freeze, mink coat, vacuum

( leaner, orange juice dispenser, or
.'â– ny other type of electrical appli
ance, and hold no stocks, bonds jj
mortgages, or any other type o.'s
money. i
Because of the present cloudecl
situation concerning a certain fundi
v/hicii was raised by my man} 1
friends to defray traveling expenses,
to a rally at one E. Rossotti's milk;
bar and debating society during lastj
spring's heated (though unsuccess-ij
ful) campaign, the party has re-

quested that the full details of my many sources of
income be revealed.
To begin with, 1 was retained as general counsel
for line STANFORD DAILY (a ncn-partisan, inde
pendent. unfettered, and absolutely free of political
prejudice, morning paper). I also served as water
boy (or the DAiLY-CIJAPPIE football game and my
salary for (be year came to thirty-four cents which
vv;\. computed by taking the score of the game and
dividing by tbe number of freshmen Roble women

in 1946.
My second position was as an advisor to the com
mittee on committees. This post carried no salary but
the holder ia entitled to twelve cents in postage
stamps. I was also retained by VIEWPOINT at the
fabulous figure of three cents a year and all the
magazines I could eat. (I ate seven).
But to get back to the traveling fund which was the
principle source of last year's income. Unfortunately
the list of donors to this fund cannot be disclosed
without considerable embarrassment to the U.S. im
migration department.
The fund consisted of two dollars and lifty-four
cents in American money and two hundred as
sorted Mexican coins. It was distributed as follows:
posters, thirty cents; paints, fifteen cents; thumb
tacks, live cents; bribes, four cents, and liquid re
freshments, two dollars. Nobody seems to know
what happened to the Mexican coins which were
worth about cents at present exchange
rates.
This is a full account of all my political funds and
income. It is really a swell idea for everyone to tell
how much money they are making and I hereby
challenge Henry Ford Jr., Dick Weismann, Juan
Peron, and Steve Horn to be good fellows and tell
all like I have just done.
