## 'Law Should Be Reasonable, Safe'

In records to your article on traffic enforcement in

Granted that for many reasons traffic enforcement
should be strict. We should obey the laws, but then
the laws should be reasonable and safe. Certainly
some of the speed limits are not reasonable and, in
some cases, it is safe to say that 98 percent of the
drivers do not observe them.
Nobody is going to travel down Palm Drive at 25
miles per hour, not c-ven when a law officer is sitting
on one of the side streets waiting for the next violator,
'i iie average person keeps the speedometer at ."55 miles

per hour . . . and that certainly seems to be a safe
and reasonable speed.
The speed limit of twenty miles per hour down the
Row was probably safe and reasonable when there
were only horses and buggies, but ... I'd be breaking
the law when I ride my bicycle down the slight grade
that is there! Cars usually travel 25 miles per hour
on Lasuen in front of the houses. It certainly seems
to be a safe speed and more reasonable.
if there is to bo strict enforcement of the speed
laws, let's first make the laws so they are reasonable
as well as safe. It would seem to be more realistic
than enforcing laws that are unreasonable and anti
quated. —TOM PETERSON
