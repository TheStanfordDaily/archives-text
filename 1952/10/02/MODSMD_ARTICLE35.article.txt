# New Collection At Libe Honors Honduras' Rosa
## 
### 
A Honduran statesman and
scholar whose memory will live
in his native land as long as there
is "a school teacher and an
opened book on the knees of a
boy" has been honored with the
dedication of a new library col
lection at Stanford.
The Ramon Rosa Collection was
presented to the University early in
September by Rafael Keliodoro Valle,
ambassador to the United States from
Honduras.
Ramon Rosa, as premier of Hon
duras, led the nation in a material
and intellectual transformation
from IK7(> to lXS;l. He died in IHIKS.
The collection, which Senor Valle
is personally sponsoring, contains at
the outset about one thousand books
and other publications. They are
largely in the fields of literature,
social science and history of Latin
America. The ambassador plans to
expand the collection considerably
and a special bookplate, with Rosa's
portrait, is being prepared in Hon
duras.
Rosa and a fellow statesman Marco
Aurelio Soto, were responsible for
the organization of public education,
the definition of the limits between
church and state, the foundation of
the national library, the national
archives, the bureau of statistics, the
first high school for women, the first
post office.
"He was to his country a breeze
and a torch. He loved the fine and
tne good, (lie beauty of language,
of silk, of marble, id' melodies, of
the rose he carried in his name.
Rosa visited California and was one
of the first Hondurans to appreciate
the United States. The ambassador
recalled Rosa's words: "The United
States will not be held back by bar
barians because its civilization is
based on nature, equality and liberty,
and will give each day new strength
to all the people of the world, and
will be the friend of all free men."
