# Gridders Scrimmage, Swelter
## 
### LARRY CAHN 
Chuck Taylor put his varsity
gridders through a torrid tjiree
hour practice under foiling skies
yesterday.
And as his squad hustled off to
the showers Chuck predicted an
other win for the Indians when they
play ho t to powerful Michigan in
the Stadium Saturday. A.s Taylor
said, "We are not working them
this hard for nothing."
It is feared that Ron Ead'e will
be out of action Saturday. Eadie,
who injured a shoulder in scrim
mage Tuesday, will be tightly
taped but, according to team doc
tor Stan Lordeaux, Eadie is al
most certain not to play.
Dick Steere, Ron Bush, and Bob
Hoegh are being groomed for de
fensive end duty. But Eadie will be
sorely missed, when Michigan starts
powering the flanks. It was Eadie
who last week made a last - ditch
tackle which prevented the winning
Washington State touchdown.
Alio out ol this week's game are
Dave Eldredge with cracked ribs,
and Skip Crist with a bad knee. It
appears that Mike Acker, who was
working the second-string quarter
back slot, ii lost to the team fo:
the season with a badly jammed
thumb which is now in a cast.
Taylor has announced that Bill
Rogers will open at riyht half in
place of the in;)/red Crist.
The junior varsity again ran
Michigan plays against the defen
sive unit, while the offensive run
ning and pa-sing game was sharp
ened.
Michigan arrives on the Farm to
morrow for a workout. Michigan
Coach Bennie Oosterbaan reported

that injured halfback Frank How
ell may not make the trip out. But
the Wolverines still have the likes
of Merritt Green, team captain, and
Lowell Perry, who goes offensively
and defen: ively, and many, many
more.
