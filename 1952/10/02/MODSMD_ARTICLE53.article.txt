## Food, CARE Parcels Sent

Who are the Angels of Stan
ford?
In the opinion of the villagers
of St. Johann, Austria, and of
other needy Europeans, the An
gels of Stanford are the Lagu
nita residents who have, for the
past five years, been sending
food, clothes, and CARE pack
ages across the ocean.
The story behind their project
begins in June 1947. Into England
came Bishop Timeotheos, an Aus
trian missionary bishop, with the
intent of persuading people to send
food and clothes to his parishioners.
Making many public speeches, he
stressed the need of his flock, and
the need of many others whose
homes had been devastated by years
of Nazi occupation .
In one of his appearances, he
pleaded:
"For the love of Christ, give not
only prayers but also all you can
spare—clothes, footwear, foods, and
medicine—to as many in need as
you can locate, and you will do a
great work of love and charity for
your fellow-sufferei's in my coun
try and elsewhere."
Hearing these and other speeches,
an Englishman, who had a daugh
ter living in Lagunita Court, wrote
to her about the bishop and his
plight. Intrigued, the girl aroused
interest among her fellow residents,
and, in 1948, the first shipments of
necessities started from Stanford to
St. Johann.
Since then, the Lagunita wom
en have informally adopted the
village, and have sent countless
supplies to it, which have been
distributed by the bishop (until
his death in '51) and his house
keeper, Sister Lore.
Every year, Lagunita Court elects
a committee to oversee the project.
Two girls from each casa are on the
committee, and they are in charge
of informing the residents about the
Austrian village, and also of col
lecting the used clothes which the
girls donate.
Cleaned and mended, the clothes
are sent to Europe, together with
CARE packages bought with the
proceeds from the annual Lagunita
Farm Fair.
In the last few years, the list of
recipients has been expanded to
families in Germany and other
countries hard hit by the war.
Marjorie Raitt, Lagunita resident
from the class of '49 who had spent
some time in St. Johann, wrote this
letter to try to express the senti

ment of the villagers toward their
beneficiaries.
"I could tell you of the many
people who came to thank me, for j
you, for the things they had re- J
ceived from the girls of Lagunita.
Some came miles by foot ;ust to
express their gratitude. One lady,
whose home is in the mountains, j
carried her daughter on her back |
all the way to St. Johann to bring
me eggs and honey. That was all
she had to give, and she did it
gladly."


READY TO SEND—Lagunita residents examine a box of con
tributed clothing, before sending the garments to Europe. Alice
Wiley, Ann Elliott, and Pauline Killin inspect the clothes, which
will be cleaned and sent to needy people in Lag's adopted Aus
trian village. i
