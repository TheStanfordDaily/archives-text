# Industrial Lab To Show Molds
## 
### 
A pioneer process for metal
casting from shell molds will be
demonstrated to foundry op
erators and business men this
afternoon at 2 at the Stanford In
dustrial Laboratory.
The process, designed by Biz
School students, promises big sav
ings for small manufacturers.
Professor Frank K. Shallenberger
of the Stanford Graduate School of
Business proposed the idea. He had
seen the molds used by mass-pro
ducing eastern manufacturers and
believed that shell molds hold great
possibilities for small businesses in
the West, too.
Instead of ramming sand around
a wood pattern to form a conven
tional "green sand" mold, the new
process calls for a mixture of sand
and thermo-setting plastic to he
brought in contact with a hot
metal pattern.
The hot pattern cures the adjacent
sand, forming a thin, rigid shell or
mold. Molten metal is then poured
into two such shells after they have
been clamped together.
The result is a metal casting of
greater precision and smoother sur
face at less cost—about o0 percent
less.
The students' initial move was to
visit Western foundries to check on
their interest in it.
"It's okay for Ford and other
mass producers hut not for the job
shop foundry," was the usual
answer. Or "We're too busy now
to experiment with something
new."
So the students took the idea into
their own Industrial Laboratory at
Stanford for a closer inspection. In
place of their usual "pilot-line" proj
ects of the past, in which they'd
learned by actually manufacturing
motors, broilers, and such items, they
undertook development, of a ma
chine to adapt the shell-molding
process to typical small foundry op
erations.
And they succeeded. Six months
atjo their highly efficient machine
produced what are believed to be the
first shell molds made in the West.
lis design is simple. The machine
cou'd he built at a fraction of the
cost of those in use in the East,
Professor Shallenberger thinks.
Up to now, most companies using
the process have kept their opera
tions under wraps. By contrast,
Stanford is willing and even anxious
to share all of its shell - molding
knowledge and experience with in
terested firms.
Professor Shallenberger has ac
cordingly scheduled a demonstration
of it for foundries and business men.
The public is invited to the demon
stration at the laboratory which is
located on Panama between Duena
Street and Lomita Drive.

Stanford is willing and even anxious
to share all of its shell - molding
knowledge and experience with in
terested firms.
Professor Shallenberger has ac
cordingly scheduled a demonstration
of it for foundries and business men.
The public is invited to the demon
stration at the laboratory which is
located on Panama between Duena
Street and Lomita Drive.
A pioneer process for metal
casting from shell molds will be
demonstrated to foundry op
erators and business men this
afternoon at 2 at the Stanford In
dustrial Laboratory.
The process, designed by Biz
School students, promises big sav
ings for small manufacturers.
Professor Frank K. Shallenberger
of the Stanford Graduate School of
Business proposed the idea. He had
seen the molds used by mass-pro
ducing eastern manufacturers and
believed that shell molds hold great
possibilities for small businesses in
the West, too.
Instead of ramming sand around
a wood pattern to form a conven
tional "green sand" mold, the new
process calls for a mixture of sand
and thermo-setting plastic to he
brought in contact with a hot
metal pattern.
The hot pattern cures the adjacent
sand, forming a thin, rigid shell or
mold. Molten metal is then poured
into two such shells after they have
been clamped together.
The result is a metal casting of
greater precision and smoother sur
face at less cost—about o0 percent
less.
The students' initial move was to
visit Western foundries to check on
their interest in it.
"It's okay for Ford and other
mass producers hut not for the job
shop foundry," was the usual
answer. Or "We're too busy now
to experiment with something
new."
So the students took the idea into
their own Industrial Laboratory at
Stanford for a closer inspection. In
place of their usual "pilot-line" proj
ects of the past, in which they'd
learned by actually manufacturing
motors, broilers, and such items, they
undertook development, of a ma
chine to adapt the shell-molding
process to typical small foundry op
erations.
And they succeeded. Six months
atjo their highly efficient machine
produced what are believed to be the
first shell molds made in the West.
lis design is simple. The machine
cou'd he built at a fraction of the
cost of those in use in the East,
Professor Shallenberger thinks.
Up to now, most companies using
the process have kept their opera
tions under wraps. By contrast,
