publicized Liquor Resolution of No
vember 28, 1951, was postponed in
definitely by Excom last night, until
the members could secure more in

current attitude toward the resolu

erendum at the Autumn Quarter
General Election to determine
whether or not the student body as
a whole approves or disapproves of
the resolution.

seemed to be that support of the
student body would lend additional
force to the resolution if introduced
as a bill to the 1053 session of the
State Legislature.
However, further discussion indi
cated the Excom members did not

action should be taken on the reso
lution. Consequently, Rodolph with-
his motion.
