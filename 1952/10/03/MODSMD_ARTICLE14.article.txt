# Nation To Watch Card-Wolverine Battle
## Ron Eadie In, Crist Out Of Big Intersectional Tilt 
### LARRY CAHN Daily Sports Editor 
Stanford's Indians will attempt to cure the pains of Big Ten-itis
when they play host to a strong Michigan team in the stadium
tomorrow with a 2:00 p.m. kickoff scheduled. There is no pre
liminary game.
In their last outing against a Big Tenner, Stanford took on too

big and powerful a dose, became"
woozy and fell second half victim
to Illinois in the Rose Bowl. Michi
gan is not quite as potent and may
be easier to swallow.
Taylor Picks Cards
Chuck Taylor has again picked
his squad to come out on top. The
Stanford mentor wants it known
that he hasn't worked his boys
hard all week for no reason. Chuck
has been right 11 times in 13 pick
ing the Cards as winners since be
coming head man.
Upwards of sixty thousand will he
on hand while countless thousands
will view the doings over a Coast
to Coast television hookup.
Stanford grid stock soared yester
day when Connie Jarvis team trainer
said that defensive end Pion Eadie
would have his shoulder taped to
enable him to see action. However,
just how long the strained shoulder
will hold up is uncertain.
Skip Crist, his knee vastly im
proved, is still sidelined, however.
Only Intcrscctiona!
The intersectionat, Stanford's first
and only of the season, will pit Stan
ford's passing game against a Mich
igan running game. Last week in
losing to Michigan State the Wol
verines rolled for 161 yards on the
ground. And Michigan State is rated
by those who make a habit of rating
teams as the Nation's number one
club.
And it was coach Bcnnie Ooster
baan's Michigan club who jumped to
a 13-0 lead over the Spartans in the
first quarter only to have State come
back with an intercepted pass and
recovered fumble to win 27-13.
Michigan runs most of its plays
out of a single wing after lining up
in a T. They often run from the T
without a shift. The men to watch
in the Michigan backfield are Quar
terback Ted Toper who works in the
T and single wing and is a good
jpasser and excellent blocker. Ted
Kress is a runner and very fast. The
same goes for halfback Frank Howell
who may be sidelined with injuries.

Harks Move Ball
The Michigan backfield moves
the football around as if they
didn't want any part of it. The
Stanford defense was up against
the same type of offense last week
against Washington State and came
out well, with the Cougars only
scores coining as result of Stanford
fumbles.
The key seems to be in the In

dian's defensive line rushing (he
Wolverines before they can set
away with their razzle dazzle and
set up their power plays.
The Michigan forward wall com
pared to Eig Ten standard is small,
weighing in at a 198 lb. average.
The Stanford lines hovers around the
205 mark per man. One of the top
men for the Wolverines is Lowell
Perry offensive end and defensive

safety man. And then there is Cap
tain Merritt Green, who Card line
coach Joe Ruetz called the best de
fensive end he has seen in some time.
Michigan's Roger Zatkoff is a top
linebacker.
Indians Feature Passes
And on the Stanford side it's the
passing. It was the passing last
year of Gary Kerkorian that
knocked the Wolverines over when

the Indians traveled to Ann Arbor.
Now Bob Garrett has come alone
to fill the shoes of graduated Ker
korian and Michigan from every in
dication is in for another aerial af
ternoon with Garrett throwing to
ends Sam Morley and John Stein
berg, with an occasional toss to hall
back Ron Cook. This combination
has already accounted for loui
touchdowns in Stanford six tallies in

the first two wins.
Chuck Taylor has strengthened his
running game and with Bob Mathias
and Ron Cook and new comer Bill
Rogers the Cards can move on the
ground thereby making their passing
game all that more effective.
During the past week Taylor has
been putting his squad through long
workouts under very hot skies. The
junior Varsity has run Michigan

| plays at the defensive unit while,
the offensive squad has sharpened
j its passing and running. Yesterday
the Indians went through light drills
witrtbut pads with more of the same
coming today.
Heat May Be Factor
The heat may play a definite
part. If the weather continues to
lie in the nineties the Cards will
have an advantage over the visitors

Harks Move Ball
The Michigan backfield moves
the football around as if they
didn't want any part of it. The
Stanford defense was up against
the same type of offense last week
against Washington State and came
out well, with the Cougars only
scores coining as result of Stanford
fumbles.
The key seems to be in the In

dian's defensive line rushing (he
Wolverines before they can set
away with their razzle dazzle and
set up their power plays.
The Michigan forward wall com
pared to Eig Ten standard is small,
weighing in at a 198 lb. average.
The Stanford lines hovers around the
205 mark per man. One of the top
men for the Wolverines is Lowell
Perry offensive end and defensive

safety man. And then there is Cap

coach Joe Ruetz called the best de
fensive end he has seen in some time.
Michigan's Roger Zatkoff is a top
linebacker.
Indians Feature Passes
And on the Stanford side it's the
passing. It was the passing last
year of Gary Kerkorian that
knocked the Wolverines over when

the Indians traveled to Ann Arbor.
Now Bob Garrett has come alone
to fill the shoes of graduated Ker
korian and Michigan from every in
dication is in for another aerial af
ternoon with Garrett throwing to
ends Sam Morley and John Stein
berg, with an occasional toss to hall
back Ron Cook. This combination
has already accounted for loui
touchdowns in Stanford six tallies in

Chuck Taylor has strengthened his

game all that more effective.
During the past week Taylor has
been putting his squad through long
workouts under very hot skies. The

Taylor Picks Cards
Chuck Taylor has again picked
his squad to come out on top. The
Stanford mentor wants it known
that he hasn't worked his boys
hard all week for no reason. Chuck
has been right 11 times in 13 pick

Upwards of sixty thousand will he

will hold up is uncertain.
Skip Crist, his knee vastly im

Only Intcrscctiona!
The intersectionat, Stanford's first
and only of the season, will pit Stan
ford's passing game against a Mich

losing to Michigan State the Wol
verines rolled for 161 yards on the
ground. And Michigan State is rated
by those who make a habit of rating
teams as the Nation's number one
club.
And it was coach Bcnnie Ooster

a 13-0 lead over the Spartans in the
first quarter only to have State come
back with an intercepted pass and
recovered fumble to win 27-13.
Michigan runs most of its plays
out of a single wing after lining up
in a T. They often run from the T
without a shift. The men to watch
in the Michigan backfield are Quar
terback Ted Toper who works in the
T and single wing and is a good
jpasser and excellent blocker. Ted
Kress is a runner and very fast. The
same goes for halfback Frank Howell
who may be sidelined with injuries.

Michigan planed in yesterday
is staying at the Old Hearst Kanoii in
Pleasanton. The Wolverines Hvill
! work out in the Stadium today. «








Stanford's Indians will attempt to cure the pains of Big Ten-itis
when they play host to a strong Michigan team in the stadium
tomorrow with a 2:00 p.m. kickoff scheduled. There is no pre
liminary game.
In their last outing against a Big Tenner, Stanford took on too

big and powerful a dose, became"
woozy and fell second half victim
to Illinois in the Rose Bowl. Michi
gan is not quite as potent and may
be easier to swallow.
Taylor Picks Cards
Chuck Taylor has again picked
his squad to come out on top. The
Stanford mentor wants it known
that he hasn't worked his boys
hard all week for no reason. Chuck
has been right 11 times in 13 pick
ing the Cards as winners since be
coming head man.
Upwards of sixty thousand will he
on hand while countless thousands
will view the doings over a Coast
to Coast television hookup.
Stanford grid stock soared yester
day when Connie Jarvis team trainer
said that defensive end Pion Eadie
would have his shoulder taped to
enable him to see action. However,
just how long the strained shoulder
will hold up is uncertain.
Skip Crist, his knee vastly im
proved, is still sidelined, however.
Only Intcrscctiona!
The intersectionat, Stanford's first
and only of the season, will pit Stan
ford's passing game against a Mich
igan running game. Last week in
losing to Michigan State the Wol
verines rolled for 161 yards on the
ground. And Michigan State is rated
by those who make a habit of rating
teams as the Nation's number one
club.
And it was coach Bcnnie Ooster
baan's Michigan club who jumped to
a 13-0 lead over the Spartans in the
first quarter only to have State come
back with an intercepted pass and
recovered fumble to win 27-13.

Michigan runs most of its plays
out of a single wing after lining up
in a T. They often run from the T
without a shift. The men to watch
in the Michigan backfield are Quar
terback Ted Toper who works in the
T and single wing and is a good
jpasser and excellent blocker. Ted
Kress is a runner and very fast. The
same goes for halfback Frank Howell
who may be sidelined with injuries.

Harks Move Ball
The Michigan backfield moves
the football around as if they
didn't want any part of it. The
Stanford defense was up against
the same type of offense last week
against Washington State and came
out well, with the Cougars only
scores coining as result of Stanford
fumbles.
The key seems to be in the In

dian's defensive line rushing (he
Wolverines before they can set
away with their razzle dazzle and
set up their power plays.
The Michigan forward wall com
pared to Eig Ten standard is small,
weighing in at a 198 lb. average.
The Stanford lines hovers around the
205 mark per man. One of the top
men for the Wolverines is Lowell
Perry offensive end and defensive

safety man. And then there is Cap
tain Merritt Green, who Card line
coach Joe Ruetz called the best de
fensive end he has seen in some time.
Michigan's Roger Zatkoff is a top
linebacker.
Indians Feature Passes
And on the Stanford side it's the
passing. It was the passing last
year of Gary Kerkorian that
knocked the Wolverines over when

the Indians traveled to Ann Arbor.
Now Bob Garrett has come alone
to fill the shoes of graduated Ker
korian and Michigan from every in
dication is in for another aerial af
ternoon with Garrett throwing to
ends Sam Morley and John Stein
berg, with an occasional toss to hall
back Ron Cook. This combination
has already accounted for loui
touchdowns in Stanford six tallies in

the first two wins.
Chuck Taylor has strengthened his
running game and with Bob Mathias
and Ron Cook and new comer Bill
Rogers the Cards can move on the
ground thereby making their passing
game all that more effective.
During the past week Taylor has
been putting his squad through long
workouts under very hot skies. The
junior Varsity has run Michigan

| plays at the defensive unit while,
the offensive squad has sharpened
j its passing and running. Yesterday
the Indians went through light drills
witrtbut pads with more of the same
coming today.
Heat May Be Factor

have an advantage over the visitors
