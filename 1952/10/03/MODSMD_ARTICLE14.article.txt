# Nation To Watch Card-Wolverine Battle
## Ron Eadie In, Crist Out Of Big Intersectional Tilt 
### LARRY CAHN Daily Sports Editor 
Stanford's Indians will attempt to cure the pains of Big Ten-itis
when they play host to a strong Michigan team in the stadium
tomorrow with a 2:00 p.m. kickoff scheduled. There is no pre
liminary game.
In their last outing against a Big Tenner, Stanford took on too

big and powerful a dose, became"
woozy and fell second half victim
to Illinois in the Rose Bowl. Michi
gan is not quite as potent and may
be easier to swallow.
Taylor Picks Cards
Chuck Taylor has again picked
his squad to come out on top. The
Stanford mentor wants it known
that he hasn't worked his boys
hard all week for no reason. Chuck
has been right 11 times in 13 pick
ing the Cards as winners since be
coming head man.
Upwards of sixty thousand will he
on hand while countless thousands
will view the doings over a Coast
to Coast television hookup.
Stanford grid stock soared yester
day when Connie Jarvis team trainer
said that defensive end Pion Eadie
would have his shoulder taped to
enable him to see action. However,
just how long the strained shoulder
will hold up is uncertain.
Skip Crist, his knee vastly im
proved, is still sidelined, however.
Only Intcrscctiona!
The intersectionat, Stanford's first
and only of the season, will pit Stan
ford's passing game against a Mich
igan running game. Last week in
losing to Michigan State the Wol
verines rolled for 161 yards on the
ground. And Michigan State is rated
by those who make a habit of rating
teams as the Nation's number one
club.
And it was coach Bcnnie Ooster
baan's Michigan club who jumped to
a 13-0 lead over the Spartans in the
first quarter only to have State come
back with an intercepted pass and
recovered fumble to win 27-13.
Michigan runs most of its plays
