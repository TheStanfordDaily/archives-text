## 
### 
Four students and an instruc
tor from the Free University of
Berlin will be on campus for
this and winter quarter, study
ing student government and
American methods of education.
Brought here by the State Depart
ment as part of its German Reorien
tation Program, the five will live in
various campus living groups and
will participate in campus, extra
curricular activities.
The four students, all seniors at
the Free University will investigate
all phases of student campus life,
paying particular attention to student
judicial and legislative and social
agencies.
Assisting the visiting group will
be three Stanford students, Phil
Saeta, Mary Gwen Foran, and Dub
Helsing.
Saeta is co-ordinator and chief
chaperon for the group.
In discussing the program yester
day, Saeta said the State Depart
ment initiated such a study scheme
last year and sent a team of Ger
man stuednts to an East coast col
lege.
He reported that the group now
studying at Stanford is the first of
its kind to be sent to a Western col
lege.
Reason why Stanford was selected,
he thought, was the close contact
maintained by the Institute of In
ternational Relations with the Ger
man school.
He pointed out since the inception
of the Free University, Stanford has
been sending clothing and books.
The four students. Miss Rotrout
Rosenfeld, who is living at
nita, Miss Inge Krauss, Ventura;
Rudolf Geissler, Sigma Nu, and
Kurt t Heilmann, Encina, will carry
a small academic load here, devot
ing most of their time to a close
examination of student administra
tive procedures.
According to Saeta, the four will
each take a different aspect of cam
pus activity. One will take student
executive functions like Excom, an
other will examine student judicial
matters, such as Men's and Women's
councils, another women's housing,
the fourth, men's housing.
