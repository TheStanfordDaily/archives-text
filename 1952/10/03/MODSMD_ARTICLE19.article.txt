# A 						Time for Re-evaluation
## 
### 
This week we go "Back to the Farm"—liter
ally in the sense riiat we return to school, men
tally in the sense that we re-examine the Uni
versity's traditions.
The timing for Back to the Farm week is ex
cellent. Before we start another year, we have
a chance to see where we've been, where we
are now, and whore we're going.
Enjoy the picnic, the displays, the talks—
but sometime during the events stop and think
about the serious aspect. Of the traditions on
which the University was founded, which have
lasted, which have lapsed, which have been
replaced by more realistic practices?
"Let the Winds of Freedom Blow" is still a
vital part of Stanford's existence. In these days
of loyalty oaths and fear campaigns, Stanford

is an oasis of academic freedom.
The student-faculty intimacy which early
Stanfordites enjoyed has faded to some degree.
However, much work is being done to restore
the friendship and co-operation which can
prove so valuable to both groups.
In other phases, Stanford has adapted itself
to changing times. As Dr. Sterling pointed out
in his talk yesterday, the University has grown
as the tempo of the higher education move
ment has increased. Curriculum changes have
reflected new needs.
However, the Back to the Farm Week re
evaluation c|f Stanford should not make us
complacent. Instead, we should look at the
bad along with the good and consider how to
make the present and future a time of prog
ress and improvement.
