# We're on TV Tomorrow

### 
We're on television tomorrow —all of us.
From the moment the Staniord band enters
the stadium and the color guard marches out
into the field, people all over the United States
who axe interested in football will see the
Stanford rooter.
Our appearance at the game—what we look
like and what our yells sound like—is an in
dividual responsibility — your responsibility
and mine. Stanford students are nationally rec
ognized for being good sports and good rooters
at football games.
We can be an asset to the team. Zeke Wal
lace, whom we elected head yell leader last
spring, must have our close co-operation. This
means no spontaneous yells, no booing of the
officials.

This year when the team hits the line of
scrimmage, the yell leaders want guiet. The
team knows we want a touchdown; they want
to make those six points, too. In the past added
noise from the rooters has grated on their
nerves and made them go offside.
This year no prayers will be offered at the
goal post by the yell leaders when we're shoot
ing for the conversion. Wallace feels that this
noise is also distracting and that the rooters are
left alone at a crucial point during the game.
So watch yourself, and watch the leaders.
Remember the folks at home are not only fol
lowing the team, but they're following you
over their TV sets.
Our reputation is in your hands.
