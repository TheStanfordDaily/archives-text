# We Have the Yell-Let's Use It
## 
### 
The axe yell.
In past years the use of "Stanford's Own"
yell has been as controversial as the current
national election. Two schools of thought exis;
on the subject:
1. The yell should be kept only for the tra
ditional Cal-Stanford Bic, Game.
2. The yell as a spirit builder is beneficial
during the stress of other games, especially
the USC game.
Head Yell Leader Zeke Wallace and this edi
torial board favor the latter policy.
The Stanford Athletic Board through its var
sity block award system shows a similar pref
erence. Previously a player could receive a
Block S only if he played 16 minutes during the
Cal game. However, now he can also earn the

award by getting in 16 minutes against USC.
Thus, we have a changing attitude—we still
recognize the traditional rivalry between Cal
and Stanford, but we also realize the impor
tance of the USC-Stanford clash.
For this reason-and others the axe yell will
probably be used at both games this year.
When we play USC Nov. 8, the inspiring yell
may be given during time out of a crucial
period.
Last year when we played USC in the Coli
seum many unorganized axe yells broke out
among the rooters. The yell leader was torn
between tradition and practicality. But he used
the yell, and we held the line and later won
the game.
We might not have the Axe, but we have the
yell—we should use it. —Ruby Bernstein
