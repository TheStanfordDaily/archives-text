# On Lowering the Drinking Age
## 
### 
Once again the question of lowering the
legal drinking age is before us.
Last fall the ASSU Executive Committee
passed a resolution favoring that California:
(1) lower to 18 the minimum legal age for "buy
ing beers, ales, and v/ines containing less than
13 percent alcohol"; and (2) provide persons
between 18 and 21 with non-transferrable pic
ture-bearing identification cards.
This resolution came before Excom Wednes
day night. They decided to sample student
opinion and to investigate what had already
been done with the resolution before going
ahead.
We feel that Excom should submit the reso

lution to the student body in a referendum.
The students themselves can then decide if
they want to go on record with such a stand.
We favor the resolution as a rational, realis
tic approach to what is now a serious problem.
If the student body backs it wholeheartedly, it
will be that much more effective. If student
opinion is against it, then naturally it should
not be issued.
The complete text of the resolution appears
below. The 1951 Excom has presented the
arguments for their stand clearly and convinc
ingly. Read the resolution, think about it, then
tell a member of Excom how you feel. It's your
chance to help give young people everywhere
a more realistic legal standing.

Whereas, the purpose of criminal legislation is the re
traint of actions detrimental to the public welfare,
and
Wh °i eis, ci iminal legislation must be enforceable and
consistently enforced, and
Whereas, we believe that the present liquor law of the
State of California fosters hyprocrisy and contempt
rather than respect for law,
He it resolved that the State <if Calif-irnia
l v Set tiie minimum legal age for the purchase of
beers, ales, and wines containing less than 13 per
cent alcohol by volume at eighteen years and
2. Provide persons between the ages of eighteen and
twenty-one years with non-transferable personal
identification which includes a picture of the
holder
This resolution is presented by the Executive Com
mittee of the Associated Students of Stanford Univer
sity in the belief that the present liquor law in Cali
fornia is unrealistic, and that it is not sound legis
lation becau:it is unenforceable and consistently
violated
We are perhaps more aware of this situation than
most citizen' because we are closer to the problem.
We are doing our best to see that the law is ob
served. and will continue to do so; but we believe
there could lie a better law.
We urge that the purchase of beers, ales, and wines
containing less than 13 percent alcohol by volume be
blade legal for 18-year-olds, because this is the age
at which good judgment is expected in other phases of
living.
It is the age, for example, at which young men are
eligible for military service. At this age a man may
marry with his parents' consent and a woman may

marry even without this consent. If he earns more
than $G00 a year he is not a dependent in the eyes of
the law. The state and federal governments as well
as most communities consider an eighteen-year-old
an adult who should assume responsibility. Yet the
privileges of adulthood are withheld.
Other stales, Illinois, New York, Georgia, and
North Dakota in particular, permit the purchase of
alcoholic beverages by eighteen-year-olds. There is
adequate precedent for adoption of such a law in
California.
As the law exists in California, a parent is forbidden
to serve alcoholic beverages to his minor children even
in his own home. Young married couples under
twenty-one may not drink or serve alcoholic bev
erages in their homes.
We feel also th:»t good legislation is that which the
citizens themselves help to enforce. If the privilege
of identification cards for beverage purchase under
a reasonable law is granted to young people from
IS to 21, we believe that they will protect that privi-
IcJgc in every way they can. This would include
careful observance of the law, and efforts to prevent
the sort ot traffic in falsified identification that now
exists.
'Hie lure of the forbidden is a strong one. It leads
to excesses. The individual who is free from un
realistic restraints is better able to exercise mature
judgment, and is more aware of his responsibility for
his own actions.
We believe this resolution is a realistic approach to
a very real problem created by an artificial law. The
present statute does not help to develop among Cali
fornia youth a respect for law or mature judgment.
Wo urge mo;t strongly your serious consideration of
the ehanw'i we propose.

We feel that Excom should submit the reso

lution to the student body in a referendum.
The students themselves can then decide if
they want to go on record with such a stand.
We favor the resolution as a rational, realis
tic approach to what is now a serious problem.
If the student body backs it wholeheartedly, it
will be that much more effective. If student
opinion is against it, then naturally it should
not be issued.
The complete text of the resolution appears
below. The 1951 Excom has presented the
arguments for their stand clearly and convinc
ingly. Read the resolution, think about it, then
tell a member of Excom how you feel. It's your
chance to help give young people everywhere
a more realistic legal standing.

beers, ales, and wines containing less than 13 per
cent alcohol by volume at eighteen years and
2. Provide persons between the ages of eighteen and
twenty-one years with non-transferable personal
identification which includes a picture of the
holder
This resolution is presented by the Executive Com
mittee of the Associated Students of Stanford Univer
sity in the belief that the present liquor law in Cali
fornia is unrealistic, and that it is not sound legis
lation becau:it is unenforceable and consistently
violated
We are perhaps more aware of this situation than
most citizen' because we are closer to the problem.
We are doing our best to see that the law is ob
served. and will continue to do so; but we believe
there could lie a better law.
We urge that the purchase of beers, ales, and wines
containing less than 13 percent alcohol by volume be
blade legal for 18-year-olds, because this is the age
at which good judgment is expected in other phases of
living.
It is the age, for example, at which young men are
eligible for military service. At this age a man may
marry with his parents' consent and a woman may

marry even without this consent. If he earns more
than $G00 a year he is not a dependent in the eyes of
the law. The state and federal governments as well
as most communities consider an eighteen-year-old
an adult who should assume responsibility. Yet the
privileges of adulthood are withheld.
Other stales, Illinois, New York, Georgia, and
North Dakota in particular, permit the purchase of
alcoholic beverages by eighteen-year-olds. There is
adequate precedent for adoption of such a law in
California.
As the law exists in California, a parent is forbidden
to serve alcoholic beverages to his minor children even
in his own home. Young married couples under
twenty-one may not drink or serve alcoholic bev
erages in their homes.
We feel also th:»t good legislation is that which the
citizens themselves help to enforce. If the privilege
of identification cards for beverage purchase under
a reasonable law is granted to young people from
IS to 21, we believe that they will protect that privi-
IcJgc in every way they can. This would include
careful observance of the law, and efforts to prevent
the sort ot traffic in falsified identification that now
exists.
'Hie lure of the forbidden is a strong one. It leads
to excesses. The individual who is free from un
realistic restraints is better able to exercise mature
judgment, and is more aware of his responsibility for
his own actions.
We believe this resolution is a realistic approach to
a very real problem created by an artificial law. The
present statute does not help to develop among Cali
fornia youth a respect for law or mature judgment.
Wo urge mo;t strongly your serious consideration of
the ehanw'i we propose.
Once again the question of lowering the
legal drinking age is before us.
Last fall the ASSU Executive Committee
passed a resolution favoring that California:
(1) lower to 18 the minimum legal age for "buy
ing beers, ales, and v/ines containing less than
13 percent alcohol"; and (2) provide persons
between 18 and 21 with non-transferrable pic
ture-bearing identification cards.

day night. They decided to sample student

arguments for their stand clearly and convinc
ingly. Read the resolution, think about it, then
tell a member of Excom how you feel. It's your
chance to help give young people everywhere
a more realistic legal standing.

This resolution is presented by the Executive Com
mittee of the Associated Students of Stanford Univer
sity in the belief that the present liquor law in Cali
fornia is unrealistic, and that it is not sound legis
lation becau:it is unenforceable and consistently
violated
We are perhaps more aware of this situation than
most citizen' because we are closer to the problem.
We are doing our best to see that the law is ob
served. and will continue to do so; but we believe
there could lie a better law.
We urge that the purchase of beers, ales, and wines
containing less than 13 percent alcohol by volume be
blade legal for 18-year-olds, because this is the age
at which good judgment is expected in other phases of
living.
It is the age, for example, at which young men are
eligible for military service. At this age a man may
marry with his parents' consent and a woman may

marry even without this consent. If he earns more
than $G00 a year he is not a dependent in the eyes of
the law. The state and federal governments as well
as most communities consider an eighteen-year-old
an adult who should assume responsibility. Yet the
privileges of adulthood are withheld.
Other stales, Illinois, New York, Georgia, and
North Dakota in particular, permit the purchase of
alcoholic beverages by eighteen-year-olds. There is
adequate precedent for adoption of such a law in
California.
As the law exists in California, a parent is forbidden
to serve alcoholic beverages to his minor children even
in his own home. Young married couples under
twenty-one may not drink or serve alcoholic bev
erages in their homes.
We feel also th:»t good legislation is that which the
citizens themselves help to enforce. If the privilege
of identification cards for beverage purchase under
a reasonable law is granted to young people from
IS to 21, we believe that they will protect that privi-
IcJgc in every way they can. This would include
careful observance of the law, and efforts to prevent
the sort ot traffic in falsified identification that now
exists.
'Hie lure of the forbidden is a strong one. It leads
to excesses. The individual who is free from un
realistic restraints is better able to exercise mature
judgment, and is more aware of his responsibility for
his own actions.
We believe this resolution is a realistic approach to
a very real problem created by an artificial law. The
present statute does not help to develop among Cali
fornia youth a respect for law or mature judgment.
Wo urge mo;t strongly your serious consideration of
the ehanw'i we propose.
Once again the question of lowering the
legal drinking age is before us.
Last fall the ASSU Executive Committee
passed a resolution favoring that California:
(1) lower to 18 the minimum legal age for "buy
ing beers, ales, and v/ines containing less than
13 percent alcohol"; and (2) provide persons
between 18 and 21 with non-transferrable pic
ture-bearing identification cards.
This resolution came before Excom Wednes
day night. They decided to sample student
opinion and to investigate what had already
been done with the resolution before going
ahead.
We feel that Excom should submit the reso

lution to the student body in a referendum.
The students themselves can then decide if
they want to go on record with such a stand.
We favor the resolution as a rational, realis
tic approach to what is now a serious problem.
If the student body backs it wholeheartedly, it
will be that much more effective. If student
opinion is against it, then naturally it should
not be issued.
