The cartoonist, Dick Bibler, re
ceived his M.A. in art at Stanford
last year. He is now teaching at the
Colorado State College of Educa
tion.
The idea for the Stanford Press
collection originated on this cam
pus. Professor Jeffrey Smith of the
Philosophy Department has taker
an uneasy interest in the cartoons
ever since Worthal and Professoi
Snarf began making their appear
ance in The Stanford Daily.
Smith suggested that :;ince tht
campus cartoons contained such
biting observations on education
they ought to be put in book form
