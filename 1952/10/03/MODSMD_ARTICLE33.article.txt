# Stanford Hosts Foreign Teachers
## 
### MARY MASSEY Associate Editor, the Daily 
Twenty-three unhappy teach
ers from 13 foreign countries ar
rived at Standard last Monday
for three months ol study.
Although they were met at the
Palo Alto station by Stanford Pro
vost Douglas M. Whitaker, Palo Alto
Mayor J. Pearce Mitchell, and Dean
of Education 1. James Quillen, the
teachers stdl did not relax. Also
on the welcoming committee were
Members ol the nine Palo Alto fam
ilies who will house some of the
teachers during their stay, but the
teachers remained worried.
Were they uneasy about their
stay in a strange hum', concerned
about their work? No—they were
most anxious about the cab driver
who drove tham from San Fran
cisco's Ferry Building to the rail
road station. They had forgotten
to pay him.
It seems that photographers at the
..Ferry Buil. ing delayed the teach r
Mjjrs, so that (hay were very late for
'*$i£ir train. Southern Pacific held
train lor them, while they
pushed to Third awd Townsend in
*ihe ill-fated taxi.
hmM
In running f<,v the train, (he
112 teachers forgot to pay the driver
of one of the cabs. They hope that
„ ilhe driver will see this storv and
write to Peter Uantanarayana,
from Ceylon, in care of Stanford.
The teachers are cart of a group

of 400 from 50 different nations who
have come to the United States for
the international teacher - training
program sponsored by the U.S. Of
fice of Education. Stanford is the
only California school included in
the program.
Dr. Grace Graham, assistant pro
fessor of education, is co-ordinator
of the program at Stanford.
Four of the visiting teachers are
women, coming from Iran, Finland,
Burma, and Italy. The men are from
Pakistan, India, Ceylon, Egypt, Den
mark, Norway, Brazil, and Hong
Kong.
AH are teachers, or administra
tors in secondary schools, or are
instructors of secondary school
teachers. Those who are not liv

ing- with Palo Alto families are
residing in the Village.*
The purpose of their visit, said Dr.
Graham, is the interchange of ideas,
as well as the presentation of a
basic philosophy for a free society.
Before coming here, the teach
ers spent several weeks in
Washington, D.C. They received
language training, orientation
courses, and sight-seeing trips.
After finishing their studies at
Stanford, the teachers will continue
their work in another state, yet un
named. They will spend three
months visiting departments of edu

cation and public schools of the
state, followed by a final week back
in the nation's cauital.


WELCOME TEACHERS!—PaIo Alto Mayor Mitchell shakes hands with teacher Dantanarayana
while Dr. Graham, Provost Whitaker, and Acting Dean Quillen wait their turns. Other members
of the teacher group and their Palo Alto host families are also looking on. The long, silver object
between Mr. Dantanarayana and Dean Quillen is a Pakistan instrument.
