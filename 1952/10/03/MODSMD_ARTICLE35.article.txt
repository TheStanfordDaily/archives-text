The Activities Booklet, the Farm's
newest aid to confused students
who can't decide which committees
and clubs to join, will be available

The 30-page mimeographed book
is designed to give all students a
clearer picture of the 150-odd avail
able activities on campus. It will
contain such vital statistics as the
objectives, the dates and meeting
places of the organizations, and
the persons to contact for further
information.
Barry Smith, Director of Activi
ties on the ASSU Public Relations
Com, says he hopes 1,000 copies of
the booklet will be available in time
for the activities talks scheduled for
next week.
The Activities Booklets will be
given to sponsors, who will issue
them to interested freshmen. Copies
will also be posted at living groups
and will be on file at the ASSU of
fice.
If the test copies prove success
ful, appropriations will be made so
that the Activities Booklet can be
come a regular supplement' to the
"Frosh Bible."
