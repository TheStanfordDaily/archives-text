that will be scattered over the court.

and cookies will be sold, and those

may purchase the ever - popular
travel posters.

; ler, who was supposed to pitch,
phoned Balch and said, "I'm eager
but out of shape. How about you
pitching and me catching?"
Balch answered, "I would, but my
big toe hurt..."
When the Daily went to prcs, the
question had not been settled.
Sports experts are faying that
it really doesn't make any diff'ir
! ence who pitches or who catches
oi- who plays what. Whatever the
personnel, Abner Doubleday, the
inventor of baseball, is expected to
do tviple somersaults in his grave,
and the clock i.s supposed to be
' turned back a century on base
ball.
Professional bookies are giving
100 to 1 odds that at least 10 errors
will be: committed. Per inning, that
is.
