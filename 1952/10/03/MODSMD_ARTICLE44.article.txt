# Togas, Olympic Runners Light Its History
## 'Back to Farm' Has Lively History 
### BARBARA TUERK Daily Feature Editor 
Togas and tandems, bustles
and beer have been carrying
Stanford "Back to the Farm"
ever since 1940 when students
first abandoned city ways and
| city clothes for the parapher
nalia of the good old days.
The 1940 festivities featured the
introduction of a new football coach,
Clark Shaughnessy, who wars to lead
his Wow Boys to the Rose Bowl the
next year.
[ Again during the 195] "Bad: to
the Farm"' Week Stanford met a
! new coach. This time it was Chuck
! Taylor, an 1 stiil another Bowl team
| in the oiling.
The first cclebrants banned
'horseless carriages" from Palm
I Drive, deputized 25 vigilantes to pa
j trol the Quad and jail anyone in
j "city slicker" garb, revived the
'Hello" tradition, and held contests,

speeches, races, and exchange din- ]'
ners.
In later years (he Gay Nineties
spirit was recreated with a tradi
tional "Old Car" parade, featuring
tandems, fire-engines, and hearses,
as well as all models of vintage au
tomobiles.
The famed torch was first relayed
to Rossotti's in 1945 when Olympic
Day was observed in coniunction
with Sadie Hawkins Day. Eighteen
toga-clad seniors raced a five-mile
course over the hills, canoed in
convoy across Lake Lag, and tri
umphantly lit their flame in an
abandoned toilet bowl at Rossotti's,
undaunted by "pirates'" who at
tempted to douse the light while it :
was being carried across the lake. I
Olympic Days in 1945 and '46, and
again when the tradition was re- I
vivej in '50, '51, and '52, featured
beer baseball and volleyball, chug
a-lug contests, and' one year, an
all-you-can-drink-for-free compe
tition.
The first Olympians were but lat
ter-day descendants of the "Irish

Marathcners," 24-man teams from '
each of the four clas.-.es, who raced [
a six-mile course during the twen
ties. Gradually, 1 icycles and all J
sorts of vehicles triad to get into I
the act and the relay evolved into
a novelty race.
Always, ''Back to the Farm" Week ;
has meant skits ;.nd rallies, from the i
1940 re-creation of the Axe-snatch- j
ing by the "Immortal 21" to the '
1951 appearance on Quad ol the four j
Chappie "professors."


HOLD THAT POSE!—No, it's not the David Starr Jordans of
1895, but Stanford's own Dean of Women Elva F. Brown and
Dean of Men Richard Balch, donned in their old-fashioned best.

Togas and tandems, bustles
and beer have been carrying
Stanford "Back to the Farm"
ever since 1940 when students
first abandoned city ways and
| city clothes for the parapher
nalia of the good old days.
The 1940 festivities featured the
introduction of a new football coach,
Clark Shaughnessy, who wars to lead
his Wow Boys to the Rose Bowl the
next year.
[ Again during the 195] "Bad: to
the Farm"' Week Stanford met a
! new coach. This time it was Chuck
! Taylor, an 1 stiil another Bowl team
| in the oiling.
The first cclebrants banned
'horseless carriages" from Palm
I Drive, deputized 25 vigilantes to pa
j trol the Quad and jail anyone in
j "city slicker" garb, revived the
'Hello" tradition, and held contests,

speeches, races, and exchange din- ]'
ners.
In later years (he Gay Nineties
spirit was recreated with a tradi
tional "Old Car" parade, featuring
tandems, fire-engines, and hearses,
as well as all models of vintage au
tomobiles.
The famed torch was first relayed
to Rossotti's in 1945 when Olympic
Day was observed in coniunction
with Sadie Hawkins Day. Eighteen
toga-clad seniors raced a five-mile
course over the hills, canoed in
convoy across Lake Lag, and tri
umphantly lit their flame in an
abandoned toilet bowl at Rossotti's,
undaunted by "pirates'" who at
tempted to douse the light while it :
was being carried across the lake. I
Olympic Days in 1945 and '46, and
again when the tradition was re- I
vivej in '50, '51, and '52, featured
beer baseball and volleyball, chug
a-lug contests, and' one year, an
all-you-can-drink-for-free compe
tition.
The first Olympians were but lat
ter-day descendants of the "Irish

Marathcners," 24-man teams from '
