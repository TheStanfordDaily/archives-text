# From Race Horses To Atom Smashers

### PAT KING 
"The Farm." Old grads use
the lerm affectionately, rival l
students sneeringly, visitors
knowingly, end freshmen ex
citedly.
The name h ;s become synony- ,
mous with Stanford University. But |
Lcland Stanford himself would ;
never recognize the gras-y meadows j
and wooded hills which he pur
chased back in 187ij. Science labs
have pushed asice old barns, and
cars speed down Palm Drive where
champion horses once set speed rec
ords at a trot.
Even the Stanford home is gone,
replaced by the Stanford Convales
cent Home. But records bulge with
the winnings of his horses, and the
old Red Barn still stands as a re
minder of former days.
300 Mares
For. here and in the oak-tree- i
shaded acreage adjoining it, more
than 75 horses were trained daily.
In the nearby pasture, now the
Stanford golf course, over 20 stal
lions' and 300 mares grazed on the I
finest grass in California. Eighty ;
men were employed to care for the |
stock, not including blacksmiths, j
Chinese laborers, harness makers,
farmers, and ranch hands.
Senator Stanford had eiyht expe- j
rience.d trainers to help him handle
â€¢his thoroughbreds. Young horses
attended a "colt kindergarten"
where they were harness broken
and run to develop speed. Be.-ides
the open training paddock, a cov- j
ered paddock was kept lor use in
rainy weather. Also located on the |
8,000-acre .stock farm were two race ,

tracks and numerous training pas
ture's.
Photo Experiments
It was in a loft of the Red Barn
that the famous Muybridge photos
were fir; t shown, the result of Le
land Stanford's insistence that all
four legs of a galloping horse are
off the ground at the same time.
Stanford arranged a battery of 24
cameras with electro - shutters to
take continuous exposurs of a gal
loping horse, and the effect* was
similar to today's movies. Stanford
proved his point, and a placque now
commemorates the exact s*;ot cf the
experiment.
Stanford was the moving spirit
behind his famed : table, and when
he died in 1893 the Palo Alto Stock
Farm passed out of existence as
such.
Stock Still Raised
But the Stanford campus is still
a farm fn more than name. Dairy
cows graze a few miles from
Quad, and hundreds of acres lie as
green and fresh as they were 80
years ago.
