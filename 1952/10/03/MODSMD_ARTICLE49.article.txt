While spirits are high and every
one waits with bated breath for the
forthcoming Stanford - Michigan ti
tanic, the battle of the century is
shaping up here in the pages of the
Stanford Daily.
Starting today, and in every Fri
day paper for the next eight weeks,
the "four mules" of the Stanford
Daily sports staff will vie for indi
vidual and team honors against the
big three of Stanford football —
Coach Chuck Taylor and co-cap
tains Jim Vick and A 1 Kirkland.
The nickname "four mules" does
not refer to strength, but indicates
intelligence.

The "Peerless Pickers of '52"
could only get together on two of
the ten games—Cal over Minnesota
and Michigan Slate over Oregon
State.
The lone dissenter in the Stan
ford - Michigan tilt was "Fearless"
Elmore Seeds, of the Daily sports
writers' junior varsity (unlisted),
who picked Michigan by 10.
Chuck Taylor was the only dis
senter in the Georgia Tech-SMU,
Maryland - Clemson, and SC - Army
games. •
Results of the first round of men
tal competition will be "aired" in
Monday's Daily.
