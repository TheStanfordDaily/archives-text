ANN ARBOR, Michigan—For what they're worth, here ore some com
ments from the Michigan end of the Wolverine-Indian clash:
Stanford is remembered by Michigan as the only Pacific Coast team in
history to defeat the Wolverines. It happened here last year. 23-13. .
However, coach Bennie Oosterbaan is strong for playing the foes as.they
come—one at a time—because he can't risk psychological ups and downs
with the top-notch schedule Michigan plays.
However again, this is not to say the Indians are being taken lightly.
As for talent, the Wolverines, bolstered by 26 lettermen, raised more
than a few eyebrows in losing the season opener to Michigan State,
last Saturday. The line, at its worst, is "substantial," to use an expression
of Wally Weber, Michigan's loquacious freshman coach.
Facing the best bunch of backs in the country, the Maize and Blue
defensive platoon allowed MSC 223 yards rushing, but 77 of them came
on one play and probably half the remainder piled up in the final quarter
when the regulars tired.
A couple of standout ends, Big Gene Knutson (6' 4", 210, lb.) and
Captain Merritt Green are tough to fool. They go well with tackles Art
Walker and Jim Balog, and guards Don Drugger and Bob Matheson. Rugged
Roger Zatkoff backs up the line that should be difficult for even Bob
Mathias to crack. If there's a defensive line problem, it's quantity, not
quality.
The big Maize and Blue weakness is no secret after Saturday. MSC
made hay by completing eight of 1G passes on crucial plays for 210 yards.
This week the Wolverines are scheduled to work hard on pass defense to
prevent Bob Garrett from staging an aerial circus like the one by Gary
Kerkorian and Bill McColl against Michigan last year.
The offensive line is centered by Dick O'Shaughnessy, with Bob Timm
and Dick Beison at the guards and Dick Strozewski and Ralph Ttribe at
the tackles. Thad Stanford and Lowell Perry, mentioned on several pre
season All-American teams, are the ends.
Although not a rugged monster of the McColl type, Perry is a sllclc
Hanker. Oosterbaan further utilizes Perry's running ability by playing
him at safety where he fields bouncing punts like a shortstop.
Before the opener with MSC, many observei's expressed worries abo.ut
the fullback and tailback positions that are key parts in Michigan's single
wing scheme of offense. There were no lettermen available, so Oosterbaan
installed Fred Baer and Ted Kress at full and left half, respectively, and
both came through with creditable performances. Kress scored a touch
down and averaged nearly four yards per rush.
The rest of the offense rests with quarterback Ted Topor and his left
handed passes, and right halfback Frank Howell and his swift running.
Behind Topor is Duncan McDonald, much-heralded sophomore passer
who is second string mainly in deference to Topor's ball handling and
blocking capabilities.
Howell has been injured seriously each of the past two seasons, and
if he gets hurt this year, Tony Branoff, a freshman, looks like a more-thim
capable fill-in. Branoff, Howell, and Don Oldham share defensive half
back chores with veteran Dave Tinkham.
On the whole, the offense is stronger than last year, when it gained
minus four yards rushing against MSC. This year against the Spartans the
Wolverines posted something like 300 yards for a total offense figure' ahd
half of that came on the ground.
So that's the Michigan picture, barring injuries which eould cralnp
the style because of thin reserve strength in key spots. Unless someofie
is disabled in practice, the team should be in top shape for the Palo Alto
clash.

Wolverines posted something like 300 yards for a total offense figure' ahd
half of that came on the ground.
So that's the Michigan picture, barring injuries which eould cralnp
the style because of thin reserve strength in key spots. Unless someofie
is disabled in practice, the team should be in top shape for the Palo Alto
clash.

ANN ARBOR, Michigan—For what they're worth, here ore some com
ments from the Michigan end of the Wolverine-Indian clash:
Stanford is remembered by Michigan as the only Pacific Coast team in
history to defeat the Wolverines. It happened here last year. 23-13. .
However, coach Bennie Oosterbaan is strong for playing the foes as.they
come—one at a time—because he can't risk psychological ups and downs
with the top-notch schedule Michigan plays.
However again, this is not to say the Indians are being taken lightly.
As for talent, the Wolverines, bolstered by 26 lettermen, raised more
than a few eyebrows in losing the season opener to Michigan State,
last Saturday. The line, at its worst, is "substantial," to use an expression
of Wally Weber, Michigan's loquacious freshman coach.
Facing the best bunch of backs in the country, the Maize and Blue
defensive platoon allowed MSC 223 yards rushing, but 77 of them came
on one play and probably half the remainder piled up in the final quarter
when the regulars tired.
A couple of standout ends, Big Gene Knutson (6' 4", 210, lb.) and
Captain Merritt Green are tough to fool. They go well with tackles Art
Walker and Jim Balog, and guards Don Drugger and Bob Matheson. Rugged
Roger Zatkoff backs up the line that should be difficult for even Bob
Mathias to crack. If there's a defensive line problem, it's quantity, not
quality.
The big Maize and Blue weakness is no secret after Saturday. MSC
made hay by completing eight of 1G passes on crucial plays for 210 yards.
This week the Wolverines are scheduled to work hard on pass defense to
prevent Bob Garrett from staging an aerial circus like the one by Gary
Kerkorian and Bill McColl against Michigan last year.
The offensive line is centered by Dick O'Shaughnessy, with Bob Timm
and Dick Beison at the guards and Dick Strozewski and Ralph Ttribe at
the tackles. Thad Stanford and Lowell Perry, mentioned on several pre
season All-American teams, are the ends.
Although not a rugged monster of the McColl type, Perry is a sllclc
Hanker. Oosterbaan further utilizes Perry's running ability by playing
him at safety where he fields bouncing punts like a shortstop.
Before the opener with MSC, many observei's expressed worries abo.ut
the fullback and tailback positions that are key parts in Michigan's single
wing scheme of offense. There were no lettermen available, so Oosterbaan
installed Fred Baer and Ted Kress at full and left half, respectively, and
both came through with creditable performances. Kress scored a touch
down and averaged nearly four yards per rush.
The rest of the offense rests with quarterback Ted Topor and his left
handed passes, and right halfback Frank Howell and his swift running.
Behind Topor is Duncan McDonald, much-heralded sophomore passer
who is second string mainly in deference to Topor's ball handling and
blocking capabilities.
Howell has been injured seriously each of the past two seasons, and
if he gets hurt this year, Tony Branoff, a freshman, looks like a more-thim
capable fill-in. Branoff, Howell, and Don Oldham share defensive half
back chores with veteran Dave Tinkham.
On the whole, the offense is stronger than last year, when it gained
minus four yards rushing against MSC. This year against the Spartans the
Wolverines posted something like 300 yards for a total offense figure' ahd
half of that came on the ground.
So that's the Michigan picture, barring injuries which eould cralnp
the style because of thin reserve strength in key spots. Unless someofie
