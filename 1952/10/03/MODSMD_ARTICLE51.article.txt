# Here's a Look at Michigan
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon the Maize
and Blue of Michigan will invade
Stanford Stadium seeking revenge
on Chuck Taylor's Indians. You will
remember that just a year ago the
Wolverines fell, 23 to 13, to an in
spired Cardinal eleven. Benny Oos
terbaan's men will have plenty of
collective "blood in their eye"
around 2 o'clock tomorrow after
noon.
But what formations can we ex
pect Michigan to use tomorrow, and
what key players can we watch to
betl* 1 enjoy the game?
The Big Ten power will run from
an unbalanced single wing. That is,
the line will have lour men on the
Strong side of the center and two
men on the weak side (see below).

The backfield will usually line up
in the "T" (similar to Stanford's
"1"), and then shift to the single
wing (see below).

In this formation, the fullback (F)
will usually get the ball, spin, air
hand the ball off to the tailback (T)
toing to the strong side, thfe wing
back (W) coming around to the
weak side, or keep it himself and
go on through the line. The tail
back (T) will do most of the passing.
These two men run the offense.
The blocking back gives an ad
vance clue as to where the plays are
going. He leads the blocking in
almost all plays.
