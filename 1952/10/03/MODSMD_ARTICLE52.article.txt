# Frosh Figure to Impress This Year
## 
### DON STEPHENS 
When Chuck Taylor goes out on
the limb weekly to predict a Stan
ford victory, he little realizes the
effect his prognostications have on
his future varsity gridders, the cur
rent frosh team.
Although possessing a four
game schedule because of the
current trend toward de-empha
sis, the lowly frosh feel they must
win if they are going to he wor
thy representatives in the'"Tay
lor winnii'if system."
Bob Ghilotti, an optimist on the
Taylor order, feels his current crop
of 55 candidates rates with the pre
vious years' standout teams.
His starting backfield, although
lacking a quarterback of the Ker
korian - Garrett caliber, is consid
ered one of the finest to play at the
Farm.
Jim Truhar, 190 pounds of bull
dozer, who runs the 100 in 9.8 and
puts the 12-pound shot 54 fesjt, is
considered the top back of the
current Papoose squad. However,
Nathan Leanse, 170-pound half
hack; Bill Tarr, 180-pound full
back; and Jerry Gustaf on, 185-
pound quarterback, figure to show
strong among conference oppo
nents.
The varsity in coming years will
probably field one of the heftiest
lines in history when the current
frosh place their IG6 average in the
Stanford Stadium.
Continuing in the footsteps of Bill
MeColl and Sam Morley, the frosh

have ends of the tall, fast, and
rangy type in John Stewart, a 185-
pounder from nearby Palo Alto, and
Steve Docter, who imposes a huge
target in his 212-pound, 6-ft. 3-in.
frame.
The guards and tackles are con
sidered by Ghilotti the prime nu
cleus of the squad. Tackle Chris
Marshall, from Palo Alto High, is
rated the anchor of the offensive
line.
Walt Eagle, guard, 185; Tom Mc-

Kenna, 188; John Sevier, 205; Joel
Sappenfield, 205; Jerry Gheraldi, 2(55,
have impressed Ghilotti as some of
the "most mature linemen" ever to
play frosh ball.
Here is the frosh schedule:
Oct. 18—UCLA at Los Angeles
Oct. 25 —Santa Clara here
Nov. B—USC here
Nov. 22—Cal here
