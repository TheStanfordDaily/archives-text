# Sterling Traces Stanford History
## 
### 
President J. E. Wallace Sterling in his Back-tothe-Farm-kick-off
address to the student body yesterday, said Stanford was founded
with "highminded generosity, committing itself to public serv
ice."
ASSU President Dick Weismann introduced Dr. Sterling to the

audience of several hundred stu
dents who had seated themselves in
the shady spots of Frost Amphithe
ater in an effort to escape the heat
of the late morning sun.
Cardinals' President Roy Alexan
der also spoke, "outlining briefly the
organization of Cardinals and some
of <its functions.
An abridged text of Dr. Sterling's
speech follows:
The keynote here is "Back to
the Farm." Back to the Farm is
a phrase with overtones of nostal
gia. Nostalgia for what?
Superficially, it is a bit ridiculous
for any given generation of stu

led to the founding of Stanford de
rive on one hand from business
success in a frontier state and on
the other from deep human tragedy.
Governor Stanford achieved notable
success in commerce, railway build
ing, and real estate.
His son, Leland, was born to Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford late in their
married life. He was a precocious
youth, fond of reading, of collecting
in the natural sciences, and of trav
eling. It was while he was traveling
in Italy that he died at the age of
fifteen.
From this deep tragedy came the
decision of the parents to found a
university as a memorial to their
son. Here was generosity commit
ting itself to public service.
And what kind of a university did
the Founders seek to establish?
First, it was to be a university
of high degree—a quality product.
Second, it was to he a univer
sity to which those of humble
material circumstances could
come and stay, provided only
they were able and of good char
acter.
I have sometimes tried to imagine
the thoughts and emotions of the
first students who came—more than
500 strong from all parts of the
country—when Stanford opened her
doors. The beautiful setting, even as

dents to feel nostalgia for the good
old days which they never knew.
We have learned to expect this of
the old grads, who sometimes re
turn, perhaps driving a 1952 Cadil
lac, and wonder why the Farm isn't
as it was in the horse and horseless
carriage days of, say, 1910.
Happily, this attitude is not fre
quently expressed, but when it is
it reminds me of the aphorism about
the return to normalcy: a desire to
return to normalcy is a desire to
get away from things as they are
and return to things as they never
quite were.
What then can the phrase ' Back
to the Farm" mean to students
w3io di<i not know the Farm in
"the tfood old davs?"
I suspect it connotes the human
instinct or trait of curiosity about,
and, if possible, pride in our origins.
The gardener, or grecn-thumber,
knows that if he is to have a
heaithy, colorful plant, he must pre
pare the soil in a way that will
insure a strong root structure.
The particular circumstances that

it is to us now, must have been im
pressive to them. And, as the first
students of a pioneer university in
the West, they must have felt a
sense of great opportunities to be
grasped.
Soon the University had a motto —
suggested by the first president, Dr.
Jordan—"Let the Winds of Freedom
Blow." For he knew full well that
if a university is to fulfill its prime
function its professors must be free
to explore any avenue of promise
for more effective teaching and new
knowledge.
And an atmosphere was cre
ated here in tlie University's first
years—an atmosphere of cordial

—"Success and tragedy"
ity: corcStality to ideas, to associ
ates, and to the setting which we
call the Farm. This cordial atmos
phere was informal without be
ing Kofj or lax.
So, to rne, at least, "Back to the
Farm" suggests the opportunity to
reflect on our origins, to look again
at the values and objectives that
were initially set for this University,
and make some appraisal of our own
stewardship.
What lias happened in American
higher education in the (52 years of
Stanford existence?
There has been a va* t expansion
in the numbers of institutions and
especially in the percentage of
those of college a:;e v/ho attend

some college or university. This ex
pansion has reached an extent that
impels us to ask, should there be
college education for all?
It seems difficult to conceive of
too much education, >ust as it is
difficult to conceive of having too
much good health. But the f'ict
remains that we are not as indi
viduals equally endowed. Not all
of us have the ability or inclina
tion to become big league ball
playcvs or concert violinists.
By the same token, not everyone
is equipped mentally to undertake a
college education. For this reason,
I do not hold for the concept that
we must provide higher education
for all.
Even so, the nation has work to
do. A large proportion, perhaps 4(;
per cent, of the top 2. r i per cent of
our youth who undoubtedly have
the mental equipment are not re
ceiving college or university edu
cation. This is a waste of a precious
natural resource.
Stanford's response to these na
tional developments lias been to
increase in size: it has grown with
its national environment. But it
has not sourht escape from the
financial difficulties which accom
panied this growth by a lowering
of its academic standards.
And do we have a university of
high degree?
On this point I may repeat what
I have already said during the past
week to this year's new students.
There are 1,500 institutions of high
er education in the United States,
only a minority of which offer grad
uate work in addition to under
graduate.
As I have met informed persons
in the field of education during the
past few years, I have made it a
practice to ask them for a frank
evaluation of our standing. It is
the considered judgment of edu
cators that our undergraduate
program is in the top eitfht, pos
sibly the top six or higher, among
the colleges of the nation.
In our graduate work, we do not,
cover the entire field of education.
We have been obliged, because of
limited financial resources, to be se
lective in our graduate work in
order to maintain quality. There is
an Association of American Univer
sities, membership in which is based
on quality and range of graduate
work. There ar only 38 members,
and Stanford is one of these.
And what of the Winds of Free
dom?
Issues of freedom are currently

acute and much discussed. We all
know or should know that freedom
in a society such as ours did not
just happen, or spring full blown
like Minerva from the head of Zeus.
It was dearly won and paid for. It
is in short, a privilege open to
abu'-e and to defense.
We all know, or should know,
that privilege, to be honorably and
successfully sustained, must exact I
parallel responsibility. This cer
tainly applies to freedom in our uni
versities in general and at Stanford
in particular. In fact, the base on
which our academic freedom refts
and is maintained is responsibility.
This applies to our whole academic
community.
For the faculty there is the re
sponsibility of hnnest work, of ob
jectivity, of good conduct, and cif
general di cretion. On this base
of responsibility rests their privi
lege-of freedom to follow new ideas
to a testing pnint which shall
prove them valid or invalid-
It is a further expression of our
motto that you as students enjoy
the privilege pf self - government
with its legislative, executive, and
judicial functions. This privilege—a
part of academic freedom—rests also
on responsibility, a responsibility
which is given point in your own
Fundamental Standard.
Finally, there is the atmosphere
of cordiality that was long since
created here. The phenomenon of
affectionate devotion to one's alma
mater is not peculiar to Stanford.
But it obtains here in unusually
high degree. It derived, originally,
I suspect, from the intimacy of re
lations between students and fac
ulty who first came together here to
undertake a new enterprise.
A strong sense of participation,
even of possession, developed.
'J he overcoming of setbacks, such
as the earthquake and financial
reverses, perpetuated and perhaps
s.trcngthcne:l this seme. In
n-eased enrollment may have mil
itated against this strong sense of
belonging, lint, I fondly hope, not
too seriously .
Perhaps some reflection on the
origins and development of Stan
ford — reflection suggested by the
phrase "Back to the Farm" — will
help us to re-infuse ourselves with
the spirit of dedication which moti
vated the Founders, with pride in a
University of high degree, and with
profound appreciation of the fact
that the Winds of Freedom blow
here—from the foothills to the Bay
—and far beyond.

ity: corcStality to ideas, to associ
ates, and to the setting which we
call the Farm. This cordial atmos
phere was informal without be
ing Kofj or lax.
So, to rne, at least, "Back to the
Farm" suggests the opportunity to
reflect on our origins, to look again
at the values and objectives that
were initially set for this University,
and make some appraisal of our own
stewardship.
What lias happened in American
higher education in the (52 years of
Stanford existence?
There has been a va* t expansion
in the numbers of institutions and
especially in the percentage of
those of college a:;e v/ho attend

some college or university. This ex
pansion has reached an extent that
impels us to ask, should there be
college education for all?
It seems difficult to conceive of
too much education, >ust as it is
difficult to conceive of having too
much good health. But the f'ict
remains that we are not as indi
viduals equally endowed. Not all
of us have the ability or inclina
tion to become big league ball
playcvs or concert violinists.
By the same token, not everyone
is equipped mentally to undertake a
college education. For this reason,
I do not hold for the concept that
we must provide higher education
for all.
Even so, the nation has work to
do. A large proportion, perhaps 4(;
per cent, of the top 2. r i per cent of
our youth who undoubtedly have
the mental equipment are not re
ceiving college or university edu
cation. This is a waste of a precious
natural resource.
Stanford's response to these na
tional developments lias been to
increase in size: it has grown with
its national environment. But it
has not sourht escape from the
financial difficulties which accom
panied this growth by a lowering
of its academic standards.
And do we have a university of
high degree?
On this point I may repeat what
I have already said during the past
week to this year's new students.
There are 1,500 institutions of high
er education in the United States,
only a minority of which offer grad
uate work in addition to under
graduate.
As I have met informed persons
in the field of education during the
past few years, I have made it a
practice to ask them for a frank
evaluation of our standing. It is
the considered judgment of edu
cators that our undergraduate
program is in the top eitfht, pos
sibly the top six or higher, among
the colleges of the nation.
In our graduate work, we do not,
cover the entire field of education.
We have been obliged, because of
limited financial resources, to be se
lective in our graduate work in
order to maintain quality. There is
an Association of American Univer
sities, membership in which is based
on quality and range of graduate
work. There ar only 38 members,
and Stanford is one of these.
And what of the Winds of Free
dom?
Issues of freedom are currently

acute and much discussed. We all
know or should know that freedom
in a society such as ours did not
just happen, or spring full blown
like Minerva from the head of Zeus.
It was dearly won and paid for. It
is in short, a privilege open to
abu'-e and to defense.
We all know, or should know,
that privilege, to be honorably and
successfully sustained, must exact I
parallel responsibility. This cer
tainly applies to freedom in our uni
versities in general and at Stanford
in particular. In fact, the base on
which our academic freedom refts
and is maintained is responsibility.
This applies to our whole academic
community.
For the faculty there is the re
sponsibility of hnnest work, of ob
jectivity, of good conduct, and cif
general di cretion. On this base
of responsibility rests their privi
lege-of freedom to follow new ideas
to a testing pnint which shall
prove them valid or invalid-
It is a further expression of our
motto that you as students enjoy
the privilege pf self - government
with its legislative, executive, and
judicial functions. This privilege—a
part of academic freedom—rests also
on responsibility, a responsibility
which is given point in your own
Fundamental Standard.
Finally, there is the atmosphere
of cordiality that was long since
created here. The phenomenon of
affectionate devotion to one's alma
mater is not peculiar to Stanford.
But it obtains here in unusually
high degree. It derived, originally,
I suspect, from the intimacy of re
lations between students and fac
ulty who first came together here to
undertake a new enterprise.
A strong sense of participation,
even of possession, developed.
'J he overcoming of setbacks, such
as the earthquake and financial
reverses, perpetuated and perhaps
s.trcngthcne:l this seme. In
n-eased enrollment may have mil
itated against this strong sense of
belonging, lint, I fondly hope, not
too seriously .
Perhaps some reflection on the
origins and development of Stan
ford — reflection suggested by the
phrase "Back to the Farm" — will
help us to re-infuse ourselves with
the spirit of dedication which moti
vated the Founders, with pride in a
University of high degree, and with
profound appreciation of the fact
that the Winds of Freedom blow
here—from the foothills to the Bay
—and far beyond.
President J. E. Wallace Sterling in his Back-tothe-Farm-kick-off
address to the student body yesterday, said Stanford was founded
with "highminded generosity, committing itself to public serv
ice."
ASSU President Dick Weismann introduced Dr. Sterling to the

audience of several hundred stu
dents who had seated themselves in
the shady spots of Frost Amphithe
ater in an effort to escape the heat
of the late morning sun.
Cardinals' President Roy Alexan
der also spoke, "outlining briefly the
organization of Cardinals and some
of <its functions.
An abridged text of Dr. Sterling's
speech follows:
The keynote here is "Back to
the Farm." Back to the Farm is
a phrase with overtones of nostal
gia. Nostalgia for what?
Superficially, it is a bit ridiculous
for any given generation of stu

led to the founding of Stanford de
rive on one hand from business
success in a frontier state and on
the other from deep human tragedy.
Governor Stanford achieved notable
success in commerce, railway build
ing, and real estate.
His son, Leland, was born to Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford late in their
married life. He was a precocious
youth, fond of reading, of collecting
in the natural sciences, and of trav
eling. It was while he was traveling
in Italy that he died at the age of
fifteen.
From this deep tragedy came the
decision of the parents to found a
university as a memorial to their
son. Here was generosity commit
ting itself to public service.
And what kind of a university did
the Founders seek to establish?
First, it was to be a university
of high degree—a quality product.
Second, it was to he a univer
sity to which those of humble
material circumstances could
come and stay, provided only
they were able and of good char
acter.
I have sometimes tried to imagine
the thoughts and emotions of the
first students who came—more than
500 strong from all parts of the
country—when Stanford opened her
doors. The beautiful setting, even as

dents to feel nostalgia for the good
old days which they never knew.
We have learned to expect this of
the old grads, who sometimes re
turn, perhaps driving a 1952 Cadil
lac, and wonder why the Farm isn't
as it was in the horse and horseless
carriage days of, say, 1910.
Happily, this attitude is not fre
quently expressed, but when it is
it reminds me of the aphorism about
the return to normalcy: a desire to
return to normalcy is a desire to
get away from things as they are
and return to things as they never
quite were.
What then can the phrase ' Back
to the Farm" mean to students
w3io di<i not know the Farm in
"the tfood old davs?"
I suspect it connotes the human
instinct or trait of curiosity about,
and, if possible, pride in our origins.
The gardener, or grecn-thumber,
knows that if he is to have a
heaithy, colorful plant, he must pre
pare the soil in a way that will
insure a strong root structure.
The particular circumstances that

Section
PAGES 1 AND 5

it is to us now, must have been im
pressive to them. And, as the first
students of a pioneer university in
the West, they must have felt a
sense of great opportunities to be
grasped.
Soon the University had a motto —
suggested by the first president, Dr.
Jordan—"Let the Winds of Freedom
Blow." For he knew full well that
if a university is to fulfill its prime
function its professors must be free
to explore any avenue of promise
for more effective teaching and new
knowledge.
And an atmosphere was cre
ated here in tlie University's first

Finally, there is the atmosphere
of cordiality that was long since
created here. The phenomenon of
affectionate devotion to one's alma

Perhaps some reflection on the
origins and development of Stan
ford — reflection suggested by the
phrase "Back to the Farm" — will
help us to re-infuse ourselves with
the spirit of dedication which moti
vated the Founders, with pride in a
University of high degree, and with
profound appreciation of the fact
that the Winds of Freedom blow
here—from the foothills to the Bay
—and far beyond.
President J. E. Wallace Sterling in his Back-tothe-Farm-kick-off
address to the student body yesterday, said Stanford was founded
with "highminded generosity, committing itself to public serv
ice."
ASSU President Dick Weismann introduced Dr. Sterling to the

audience of several hundred stu
dents who had seated themselves in
the shady spots of Frost Amphithe
ater in an effort to escape the heat
of the late morning sun.
Cardinals' President Roy Alexan
der also spoke, "outlining briefly the
organization of Cardinals and some
of <its functions.
An abridged text of Dr. Sterling's
speech follows:
The keynote here is "Back to
the Farm." Back to the Farm is
a phrase with overtones of nostal
gia. Nostalgia for what?
Superficially, it is a bit ridiculous
for any given generation of stu

led to the founding of Stanford de
rive on one hand from business
success in a frontier state and on
the other from deep human tragedy.
Governor Stanford achieved notable
success in commerce, railway build
ing, and real estate.
His son, Leland, was born to Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford late in their
married life. He was a precocious
youth, fond of reading, of collecting
in the natural sciences, and of trav
eling. It was while he was traveling
in Italy that he died at the age of
fifteen.
From this deep tragedy came the
decision of the parents to found a
university as a memorial to their
son. Here was generosity commit
ting itself to public service.
And what kind of a university did
the Founders seek to establish?
First, it was to be a university
of high degree—a quality product.
Second, it was to he a univer
sity to which those of humble
material circumstances could
come and stay, provided only
they were able and of good char
acter.
I have sometimes tried to imagine
the thoughts and emotions of the
first students who came—more than
500 strong from all parts of the
country—when Stanford opened her
doors. The beautiful setting, even as

dents to feel nostalgia for the good
old days which they never knew.
We have learned to expect this of
the old grads, who sometimes re
turn, perhaps driving a 1952 Cadil
lac, and wonder why the Farm isn't
as it was in the horse and horseless
carriage days of, say, 1910.
Happily, this attitude is not fre
quently expressed, but when it is
it reminds me of the aphorism about
the return to normalcy: a desire to
return to normalcy is a desire to
get away from things as they are
and return to things as they never
quite were.
What then can the phrase ' Back
to the Farm" mean to students
w3io di<i not know the Farm in
"the tfood old davs?"
I suspect it connotes the human
instinct or trait of curiosity about,
and, if possible, pride in our origins.
The gardener, or grecn-thumber,
knows that if he is to have a
heaithy, colorful plant, he must pre
pare the soil in a way that will
insure a strong root structure.
The particular circumstances that

Section

it is to us now, must have been im
pressive to them. And, as the first
students of a pioneer university in
the West, they must have felt a
sense of great opportunities to be
grasped.
Soon the University had a motto —
suggested by the first president, Dr.
Jordan—"Let the Winds of Freedom
Blow." For he knew full well that
if a university is to fulfill its prime
function its professors must be free
to explore any avenue of promise
for more effective teaching and new
knowledge.
And an atmosphere was cre
ated here in tlie University's first
years—an atmosphere of cordial

—"Success and tragedy"
ity: corcStality to ideas, to associ
ates, and to the setting which we
call the Farm. This cordial atmos
phere was informal without be
ing Kofj or lax.
So, to rne, at least, "Back to the
Farm" suggests the opportunity to
reflect on our origins, to look again
at the values and objectives that
were initially set for this University,
and make some appraisal of our own
stewardship.
What lias happened in American
higher education in the (52 years of
Stanford existence?
There has been a va* t expansion
in the numbers of institutions and
especially in the percentage of
those of college a:;e v/ho attend

some college or university. This ex
pansion has reached an extent that
impels us to ask, should there be
college education for all?
It seems difficult to conceive of
too much education, >ust as it is
difficult to conceive of having too
much good health. But the f'ict
remains that we are not as indi
viduals equally endowed. Not all
of us have the ability or inclina
tion to become big league ball
playcvs or concert violinists.
By the same token, not everyone
is equipped mentally to undertake a
college education. For this reason,
I do not hold for the concept that
we must provide higher education
for all.
Even so, the nation has work to
do. A large proportion, perhaps 4(;
per cent, of the top 2. r i per cent of
our youth who undoubtedly have
the mental equipment are not re
ceiving college or university edu
cation. This is a waste of a precious
natural resource.
Stanford's response to these na
tional developments lias been to
increase in size: it has grown with
its national environment. But it
has not sourht escape from the
financial difficulties which accom
panied this growth by a lowering
of its academic standards.
And do we have a university of
high degree?
On this point I may repeat what
I have already said during the past
week to this year's new students.
There are 1,500 institutions of high
er education in the United States,
only a minority of which offer grad
uate work in addition to under
graduate.
As I have met informed persons
in the field of education during the
past few years, I have made it a
practice to ask them for a frank
evaluation of our standing. It is
the considered judgment of edu
cators that our undergraduate
program is in the top eitfht, pos
sibly the top six or higher, among
the colleges of the nation.
In our graduate work, we do not,
cover the entire field of education.
We have been obliged, because of
limited financial resources, to be se
lective in our graduate work in
order to maintain quality. There is
an Association of American Univer
sities, membership in which is based
on quality and range of graduate
work. There ar only 38 members,
and Stanford is one of these.
And what of the Winds of Free
dom?
Issues of freedom are currently

acute and much discussed. We all
know or should know that freedom
in a society such as ours did not
just happen, or spring full blown
like Minerva from the head of Zeus.
It was dearly won and paid for. It
is in short, a privilege open to
abu'-e and to defense.
We all know, or should know,
that privilege, to be honorably and
successfully sustained, must exact I
parallel responsibility. This cer
tainly applies to freedom in our uni
versities in general and at Stanford
in particular. In fact, the base on
which our academic freedom refts
and is maintained is responsibility.
This applies to our whole academic
community.
For the faculty there is the re
sponsibility of hnnest work, of ob

general di cretion. On this base

country—when Stanford opened her
doors. The beautiful setting, even as

dents to feel nostalgia for the good
old days which they never knew.
We have learned to expect this of
the old grads, who sometimes re
turn, perhaps driving a 1952 Cadil
lac, and wonder why the Farm isn't
as it was in the horse and horseless
carriage days of, say, 1910.
Happily, this attitude is not fre
quently expressed, but when it is
it reminds me of the aphorism about
the return to normalcy: a desire to
return to normalcy is a desire to
get away from things as they are
and return to things as they never
quite were.
What then can the phrase ' Back
to the Farm" mean to students
w3io di<i not know the Farm in
"the tfood old davs?"
I suspect it connotes the human
instinct or trait of curiosity about,
and, if possible, pride in our origins.
The gardener, or grecn-thumber,
knows that if he is to have a
heaithy, colorful plant, he must pre
pare the soil in a way that will
insure a strong root structure.
The particular circumstances that

it is to us now, must have been im
pressive to them. And, as the first
students of a pioneer university in
the West, they must have felt a
sense of great opportunities to be
grasped.
Soon the University had a motto —
suggested by the first president, Dr.
Jordan—"Let the Winds of Freedom
Blow." For he knew full well that
if a university is to fulfill its prime
function its professors must be free
to explore any avenue of promise
for more effective teaching and new
knowledge.
And an atmosphere was cre

years—an atmosphere of cordial

—"Success and tragedy"
ity: corcStality to ideas, to associ
ates, and to the setting which we
call the Farm. This cordial atmos
phere was informal without be
ing Kofj or lax.
So, to rne, at least, "Back to the
Farm" suggests the opportunity to
reflect on our origins, to look again
at the values and objectives that
were initially set for this University,
and make some appraisal of our own
stewardship.
What lias happened in American
higher education in the (52 years of
Stanford existence?
There has been a va* t expansion
in the numbers of institutions and
especially in the percentage of
those of college a:;e v/ho attend

some college or university. This ex
pansion has reached an extent that
impels us to ask, should there be
college education for all?
It seems difficult to conceive of
too much education, >ust as it is
difficult to conceive of having too
much good health. But the f'ict
remains that we are not as indi
viduals equally endowed. Not all
of us have the ability or inclina
tion to become big league ball
playcvs or concert violinists.
By the same token, not everyone
is equipped mentally to undertake a
college education. For this reason,
I do not hold for the concept that
we must provide higher education
for all.
Even so, the nation has work to
do. A large proportion, perhaps 4(;
per cent, of the top 2. r i per cent of
our youth who undoubtedly have
the mental equipment are not re
ceiving college or university edu
cation. This is a waste of a precious
natural resource.
Stanford's response to these na
tional developments lias been to
increase in size: it has grown with
its national environment. But it
has not sourht escape from the
financial difficulties which accom
panied this growth by a lowering
of its academic standards.
And do we have a university of
high degree?
On this point I may repeat what
I have already said during the past
week to this year's new students.
There are 1,500 institutions of high
er education in the United States,
only a minority of which offer grad
uate work in addition to under
graduate.
As I have met informed persons
in the field of education during the
past few years, I have made it a
practice to ask them for a frank
evaluation of our standing. It is
the considered judgment of edu
cators that our undergraduate
program is in the top eitfht, pos
sibly the top six or higher, among
the colleges of the nation.
In our graduate work, we do not,
cover the entire field of education.
We have been obliged, because of
limited financial resources, to be se
lective in our graduate work in
order to maintain quality. There is
an Association of American Univer
sities, membership in which is based
on quality and range of graduate
work. There ar only 38 members,
and Stanford is one of these.
And what of the Winds of Free
dom?
Issues of freedom are currently

acute and much discussed. We all
know or should know that freedom
in a society such as ours did not
just happen, or spring full blown
like Minerva from the head of Zeus.
It was dearly won and paid for. It
is in short, a privilege open to
abu'-e and to defense.
We all know, or should know,
that privilege, to be honorably and
successfully sustained, must exact I
parallel responsibility. This cer
tainly applies to freedom in our uni
versities in general and at Stanford
in particular. In fact, the base on
which our academic freedom refts
and is maintained is responsibility.
This applies to our whole academic
community.
For the faculty there is the re
sponsibility of hnnest work, of ob
jectivity, of good conduct, and cif
general di cretion. On this base
of responsibility rests their privi
lege-of freedom to follow new ideas
to a testing pnint which shall
prove them valid or invalid-
It is a further expression of our
motto that you as students enjoy
the privilege pf self - government
with its legislative, executive, and
judicial functions. This privilege—a
part of academic freedom—rests also
on responsibility, a responsibility
which is given point in your own
Fundamental Standard.
Finally, there is the atmosphere
of cordiality that was long since
created here. The phenomenon of
affectionate devotion to one's alma
mater is not peculiar to Stanford.
But it obtains here in unusually
high degree. It derived, originally,
I suspect, from the intimacy of re
lations between students and fac
ulty who first came together here to
undertake a new enterprise.
A strong sense of participation,
even of possession, developed.
'J he overcoming of setbacks, such
as the earthquake and financial
reverses, perpetuated and perhaps
s.trcngthcne:l this seme. In
n-eased enrollment may have mil
itated against this strong sense of
belonging, lint, I fondly hope, not
too seriously .
Perhaps some reflection on the
origins and development of Stan
ford — reflection suggested by the
phrase "Back to the Farm" — will
help us to re-infuse ourselves with
the spirit of dedication which moti
vated the Founders, with pride in a
University of high degree, and with
profound appreciation of the fact
that the Winds of Freedom blow
here—from the foothills to the Bay
—and far beyond.
President J. E. Wallace Sterling in his Back-tothe-Farm-kick-off
address to the student body yesterday, said Stanford was founded
with "highminded generosity, committing itself to public serv
ice."
ASSU President Dick Weismann introduced Dr. Sterling to the

audience of several hundred stu
dents who had seated themselves in
the shady spots of Frost Amphithe
ater in an effort to escape the heat
of the late morning sun.
Cardinals' President Roy Alexan
der also spoke, "outlining briefly the
organization of Cardinals and some
of <its functions.
An abridged text of Dr. Sterling's
speech follows:
The keynote here is "Back to
the Farm." Back to the Farm is
a phrase with overtones of nostal
gia. Nostalgia for what?
Superficially, it is a bit ridiculous
for any given generation of stu

led to the founding of Stanford de
rive on one hand from business
success in a frontier state and on
the other from deep human tragedy.
Governor Stanford achieved notable
success in commerce, railway build
ing, and real estate.
His son, Leland, was born to Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford late in their
married life. He was a precocious
youth, fond of reading, of collecting
in the natural sciences, and of trav
eling. It was while he was traveling
in Italy that he died at the age of
fifteen.
From this deep tragedy came the
decision of the parents to found a
university as a memorial to their
son. Here was generosity commit
ting itself to public service.
And what kind of a university did
the Founders seek to establish?
First, it was to be a university
of high degree—a quality product.
Second, it was to he a univer
sity to which those of humble
material circumstances could
come and stay, provided only
they were able and of good char
acter.
I have sometimes tried to imagine
the thoughts and emotions of the
first students who came—more than
500 strong from all parts of the

acter.
I have sometimes tried to imagine
the thoughts and emotions of the
first students who came—more than
500 strong from all parts of the
country—when Stanford opened her
doors. The beautiful setting, even as

dents to feel nostalgia for the good
old days which they never knew.
We have learned to expect this of
the old grads, who sometimes re
turn, perhaps driving a 1952 Cadil
lac, and wonder why the Farm isn't
as it was in the horse and horseless
carriage days of, say, 1910.
Happily, this attitude is not fre
quently expressed, but when it is
it reminds me of the aphorism about
the return to normalcy: a desire to
return to normalcy is a desire to
get away from things as they are
and return to things as they never
quite were.
What then can the phrase ' Back
to the Farm" mean to students
w3io di<i not know the Farm in
"the tfood old davs?"
I suspect it connotes the human
instinct or trait of curiosity about,
and, if possible, pride in our origins.
The gardener, or grecn-thumber,
knows that if he is to have a

The particular circumstances that

it is to us now, must have been im
pressive to them. And, as the first
students of a pioneer university in
the West, they must have felt a
sense of great opportunities to be
grasped.
Soon the University had a motto —
suggested by the first president, Dr.
Jordan—"Let the Winds of Freedom
Blow." For he knew full well that
if a university is to fulfill its prime
function its professors must be free
to explore any avenue of promise
for more effective teaching and new
knowledge.
And an atmosphere was cre
ated here in tlie University's first
years—an atmosphere of cordial

ity: corcStality to ideas, to associ
ates, and to the setting which we
call the Farm. This cordial atmos
phere was informal without be
ing Kofj or lax.
So, to rne, at least, "Back to the
Farm" suggests the opportunity to
reflect on our origins, to look again
at the values and objectives that
were initially set for this University,
and make some appraisal of our own
stewardship.
What lias happened in American
higher education in the (52 years of
Stanford existence?
There has been a va* t expansion
in the numbers of institutions and
especially in the percentage of
those of college a:;e v/ho attend

some college or university. This ex
pansion has reached an extent that
impels us to ask, should there be
college education for all?
It seems difficult to conceive of
too much education, >ust as it is
difficult to conceive of having too
much good health. But the f'ict
remains that we are not as indi
viduals equally endowed. Not all
of us have the ability or inclina
tion to become big league ball
playcvs or concert violinists.
By the same token, not everyone
is equipped mentally to undertake a
college education. For this reason,
I do not hold for the concept that
we must provide higher education
for all.
Even so, the nation has work to
do. A large proportion, perhaps 4(;
per cent, of the top 2. r i per cent of
our youth who undoubtedly have
the mental equipment are not re
ceiving college or university edu
cation. This is a waste of a precious
natural resource.
Stanford's response to these na
tional developments lias been to
increase in size: it has grown with
its national environment. But it
has not sourht escape from the
financial difficulties which accom
panied this growth by a lowering
of its academic standards.
And do we have a university of
high degree?
On this point I may repeat what
I have already said during the past
week to this year's new students.
There are 1,500 institutions of high
er education in the United States,
only a minority of which offer grad
uate work in addition to under
graduate.
As I have met informed persons
in the field of education during the
past few years, I have made it a
practice to ask them for a frank
evaluation of our standing. It is
the considered judgment of edu
cators that our undergraduate
program is in the top eitfht, pos
sibly the top six or higher, among
the colleges of the nation.
In our graduate work, we do not,
cover the entire field of education.
We have been obliged, because of
limited financial resources, to be se
lective in our graduate work in
order to maintain quality. There is
an Association of American Univer
sities, membership in which is based
on quality and range of graduate
work. There ar only 38 members,
and Stanford is one of these.
And what of the Winds of Free
dom?
Issues of freedom are currently

acute and much discussed. We all
know or should know that freedom
in a society such as ours did not
just happen, or spring full blown
like Minerva from the head of Zeus.
It was dearly won and paid for. It
is in short, a privilege open to
abu'-e and to defense.
We all know, or should know,
that privilege, to be honorably and
successfully sustained, must exact I
parallel responsibility. This cer
tainly applies to freedom in our uni
versities in general and at Stanford
in particular. In fact, the base on
which our academic freedom refts
and is maintained is responsibility.
This applies to our whole academic
community.
For the faculty there is the re
sponsibility of hnnest work, of ob
jectivity, of good conduct, and cif
general di cretion. On this base
of responsibility rests their privi
lege-of freedom to follow new ideas
to a testing pnint which shall
prove them valid or invalid-
It is a further expression of our
motto that you as students enjoy
the privilege pf self - government
with its legislative, executive, and
judicial functions. This privilege—a
part of academic freedom—rests also
on responsibility, a responsibility
which is given point in your own
Fundamental Standard.
Finally, there is the atmosphere
of cordiality that was long since
created here. The phenomenon of
affectionate devotion to one's alma
mater is not peculiar to Stanford.
But it obtains here in unusually
high degree. It derived, originally,
I suspect, from the intimacy of re
lations between students and fac
ulty who first came together here to
undertake a new enterprise.
A strong sense of participation,
even of possession, developed.
'J he overcoming of setbacks, such
as the earthquake and financial
reverses, perpetuated and perhaps
s.trcngthcne:l this seme. In
n-eased enrollment may have mil
itated against this strong sense of
belonging, lint, I fondly hope, not
too seriously .
Perhaps some reflection on the
origins and development of Stan
ford — reflection suggested by the
phrase "Back to the Farm" — will
help us to re-infuse ourselves with
the spirit of dedication which moti
vated the Founders, with pride in a
University of high degree, and with
profound appreciation of the fact
that the Winds of Freedom blow
here—from the foothills to the Bay
—and far beyond.

President J. E. Wallace Sterling in his Back-tothe-Farm-kick-off
address to the student body yesterday, said Stanford was founded
with "highminded generosity, committing itself to public serv
ice."
ASSU President Dick Weismann introduced Dr. Sterling to the

audience of several hundred stu
dents who had seated themselves in
the shady spots of Frost Amphithe
ater in an effort to escape the heat
of the late morning sun.
Cardinals' President Roy Alexan
der also spoke, "outlining briefly the
organization of Cardinals and some
of <its functions.
An abridged text of Dr. Sterling's
speech follows:
The keynote here is "Back to
the Farm." Back to the Farm is
a phrase with overtones of nostal
gia. Nostalgia for what?
Superficially, it is a bit ridiculous
for any given generation of stu

led to the founding of Stanford de
rive on one hand from business
success in a frontier state and on
the other from deep human tragedy.
Governor Stanford achieved notable
success in commerce, railway build
ing, and real estate.
His son, Leland, was born to Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford late in their
married life. He was a precocious
youth, fond of reading, of collecting
in the natural sciences, and of trav
eling. It was while he was traveling
in Italy that he died at the age of
fifteen.
From this deep tragedy came the
decision of the parents to found a
university as a memorial to their
son. Here was generosity commit
ting itself to public service.
And what kind of a university did
the Founders seek to establish?
First, it was to be a university
of high degree—a quality product.
Second, it was to he a univer
sity to which those of humble
material circumstances could
come and stay, provided only
they were able and of good char
acter.
I have sometimes tried to imagine
the thoughts and emotions of the
first students who came—more than
500 strong from all parts of the
