# Sterling Traces Stanford History
## 
### 
President J. E. Wallace Sterling in his Back-tothe-Farm-kick-off
address to the student body yesterday, said Stanford was founded
with "highminded generosity, committing itself to public serv
ice."
ASSU President Dick Weismann introduced Dr. Sterling to the

audience of several hundred stu
dents who had seated themselves in
the shady spots of Frost Amphithe
ater in an effort to escape the heat
of the late morning sun.
Cardinals' President Roy Alexan
der also spoke, "outlining briefly the
organization of Cardinals and some
of <its functions.
An abridged text of Dr. Sterling's
speech follows:
The keynote here is "Back to
the Farm." Back to the Farm is
a phrase with overtones of nostal
gia. Nostalgia for what?
Superficially, it is a bit ridiculous
for any given generation of stu

led to the founding of Stanford de
rive on one hand from business
success in a frontier state and on
the other from deep human tragedy.
Governor Stanford achieved notable
success in commerce, railway build
ing, and real estate.
His son, Leland, was born to Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford late in their
married life. He was a precocious
youth, fond of reading, of collecting
in the natural sciences, and of trav
eling. It was while he was traveling
in Italy that he died at the age of
fifteen.
From this deep tragedy came the
decision of the parents to found a
university as a memorial to their
son. Here was generosity commit
ting itself to public service.
And what kind of a university did
the Founders seek to establish?
First, it was to be a university
of high degree—a quality product.
Second, it was to he a univer
sity to which those of humble
material circumstances could
come and stay, provided only
they were able and of good char
acter.
I have sometimes tried to imagine
the thoughts and emotions of the
first students who came—more than
500 strong from all parts of the
country—when Stanford opened her
doors. The beautiful setting, even as

dents to feel nostalgia for the good
old days which they never knew.
We have learned to expect this of
the old grads, who sometimes re
turn, perhaps driving a 1952 Cadil
lac, and wonder why the Farm isn't
as it was in the horse and horseless
carriage days of, say, 1910.
Happily, this attitude is not fre
quently expressed, but when it is
it reminds me of the aphorism about
the return to normalcy: a desire to
return to normalcy is a desire to
get away from things as they are
and return to things as they never
quite were.
What then can the phrase ' Back
to the Farm" mean to students
w3io di<i not know the Farm in
"the tfood old davs?"
I suspect it connotes the human
instinct or trait of curiosity about,
and, if possible, pride in our origins.
The gardener, or grecn-thumber,
knows that if he is to have a
heaithy, colorful plant, he must pre
pare the soil in a way that will
insure a strong root structure.
The particular circumstances that

it is to us now, must have been im
pressive to them. And, as the first
students of a pioneer university in
the West, they must have felt a
sense of great opportunities to be
grasped.
Soon the University had a motto —
suggested by the first president, Dr.
Jordan—"Let the Winds of Freedom
Blow." For he knew full well that
if a university is to fulfill its prime
function its professors must be free
to explore any avenue of promise
for more effective teaching and new
knowledge.
And an atmosphere was cre
ated here in tlie University's first
years—an atmosphere of cordial
