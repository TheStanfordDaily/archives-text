Though it is far too early to tel
he extent of Republican inroads ir
he South, it is obvious that dis
atisfaction with the Truman admin
stration is seething angrily.
The wide gull between the
Northern, more liberal wins? of the
Democratic party and the Southern
r~T ervnt : v»s became glaringly
evident during the July conven
tions when they vowed they would
buck the convention and destroy
party unity rather than submit to
a loyalty proposal.
Though the proposal simply called
m the states to place the Democratic
party candidates on the ballot, the |
Southerners maintained such a pro- ;
oosal was counter to the laws of
-heir states.
They charged the Northern wing
of the party was trying to throttle
the South and that the only defense
the South had was retreat from the
party.
To prevent such a break, the
Northern liberals, who worn led
primarily by Franklin Roosevelt Jr.,
backed down and watered the loy
alty proclamation.
The South uneasily stayed with
the party, keeping nervous watch as
they carefully noted the antics of
the Democratic standard bearers.
Adlai Stevenson and his leaders
tried to woo the South, courting the '

Dixie leaders at gala dinners and
I meetings.
At the convention, the Liberal
element from the North had tried
to initiate a holding c.'innroinise
with the South by awarding the
vice-presidential nomination to a
I Southerner.
But the choice, Senator John
Sparkinan of Alabama, was known
as a shakcy Southerner, one who
supported the liberal wing its much
a; ne uid the South.
But the period of uneasy waiting
exploded early this month when
A.d 1 ni Stevenson stumped the South
ind frankly admitted that he be
lieved in the Federal control of tide
lands oil.
Tidelands oil had always been a
soie i oint with the South, par
ticularly Louisiana and Texas, both
shies with extensive tidclaml
claims.
The South, traditionally fearful
of the Federal cncrocchment on
state's rights, insisted tidelands l:c
-j loajjrd to the states and should be

administered l>y (hem.
Stevenson's declaration about tide
lands thus shook the South with
shattering force.
In 192H, when Herbert Iloover and
A 1 Smith were slugging it out for
the presidency, Texas led a Southern
revolt and led four states into the
Republican file.
The same could happen again.
