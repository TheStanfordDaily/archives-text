# Alumni House Debut Slated for Saturday
## 
### BARBARA TUERK Daily Feature Editor 
An open house lolowing Saturdays' Oregon Slate game will
give students their first chance to explore Bowman House, newly
constructed headquarters of the Alumni Association.
Like most student-alumni functions, the open house will be
organized and sponsored by the Axe Society, a student service

group dating back to 190G. '
In the cfirly days of the university,
a select group of prominent senior
men formed the "Quad Club" to
discuss important campus issues and
to advise the university administra
tion on student opinion.
Birth of Axe Society
When in the 1930's the Stanford
student body grew too large for a
small group of senior - , to represent
student opinion, the Club was tem
porarily discontinued, then replaced
by a new organization entitled "The
Stanford Axe Society."
Past Activities
During the late 1930's the society
handled such projects as transfer
orientation. p.e-reg week, tlic frosh
bible, and an annual student-faculty
day. The group was discontinued
during the war. when the re were too
few men en campus to handle the
tasks.
The group was re-chartered last
year with a new purpose: the fos
tering of better relations between
alumni and students. Criticized at
first, for the vagueness of its purpose,
the society was quick to announce
specific plans for 1952-53.
New Plans
Projects include:
1. Setting up regional clubs in
which Stanford students and alumni
may work together to foster uni
versity projects. The Stanford stu
dents of Illinois has already been
formed, and Washington and Colo
rado Clubs are being planned.
2. Helping the Alumni Association
with on-eampus conferences. In this
capacity the society provided trans
portation, traffic direction and tours
for last spring's homecoming week
end.
3. Acquainting students with the
work of the Alumni Association, and
the facilities of Bowman House.
Saturday's Open House will give the
campus as a whole its first chance
to see the inside of the new build
ing, although many campus gioups
have already used its lounge for
meetings.
Any sophomore, junior, or senior
student who participates with the
society in its campus projects is made

are: Sam Freshman, president; Micky
Beller, secretary. Noel dc Nevers

organized and sponsored by the Axe Society, a student service

group dating back to 190G. '
In the cfirly days of the university,
a select group of prominent senior
men formed the "Quad Club" to
discuss important campus issues and
to advise the university administra
tion on student opinion.
Birth of Axe Society
When in the 1930's the Stanford
student body grew too large for a
small group of senior - , to represent
student opinion, the Club was tem
porarily discontinued, then replaced
by a new organization entitled "The
Stanford Axe Society."
Past Activities
During the late 1930's the society
handled such projects as transfer
orientation. p.e-reg week, tlic frosh
bible, and an annual student-faculty
day. The group was discontinued
during the war. when the re were too
few men en campus to handle the
tasks.
The group was re-chartered last
year with a new purpose: the fos
tering of better relations between
alumni and students. Criticized at
first, for the vagueness of its purpose,
the society was quick to announce
specific plans for 1952-53.
New Plans
Projects include:
1. Setting up regional clubs in
which Stanford students and alumni
may work together to foster uni
versity projects. The Stanford stu
dents of Illinois has already been
formed, and Washington and Colo
rado Clubs are being planned.
2. Helping the Alumni Association
with on-eampus conferences. In this
capacity the society provided trans
portation, traffic direction and tours
for last spring's homecoming week
end.
3. Acquainting students with the
work of the Alumni Association, and
the facilities of Bowman House.
Saturday's Open House will give the
campus as a whole its first chance
to see the inside of the new build
ing, although many campus gioups
have already used its lounge for
meetings.
Any sophomore, junior, or senior
student who participates with the
society in its campus projects is made
;i member The officers of the club

are: Sam Freshman, president; Micky
Beller, secretary. Noel dc Nevers
and Jack Fine arc co-chairmen of
Saturday's Open House,
An open house lolowing Saturdays' Oregon Slate game will

organized and sponsored by the Axe Society, a student service
