# West Soothes Iran
## 
### 
TEIIIt AN Britain and the United
States sought today to allay the sus
picions of Premier Mohammed Mos
sadegh with a fuller explanation of
the Truman-Churchill plan for set
tling the Anglo-Iranian oil dispute.
They ignored the counter-propo
sals Mossadegh fired back in an ul
timatum rejecting the plan. The
10-day deadline expired Saturday,
and the new notes were delivered
by the Western envoys here only
today.
The next move was up to Mossa
degh. He was to decide whether ot
break relations with Britain, with
draw his envoy to London, take up
the Truman - Churchill proposals
again, or repeat his own proposals.
