# Defense Halts Michigan; Leads 14 to 7 Triumph
## TD Comes On Interference 
### LARRY CAHN Daily Sports Editor 
Michigan came west, ran
smack into a group of Indians
who wouldn't give up anything,
and was sent back to Ann Arbor
on the short end of a 14-7 score
Saturday.
Stanford's defensive unit, which
was awfully tough when it had to
he, was the chief factor in giving
the Cards their third win of the
season, said head man Chuck Tay
lor.
It was the defensive unit which
held the victors to \'<L2 yards on
the ground, 40 less than they got
last week against Michigan State.
And for a Big Ten power club to
be limited to 122 yards is an excel
lent afternoon's work.
It was John Stanton, Al lvirk
laud, and sophomore guards Win
Wedge and Matt Armitage and in
fact the entire defensive unit
which deserved qiajcr credit for
the win.
It was Stanton who, despite being
partially blocked, threw a Michigan
player for a nine-yard loss when
the Wolverines were driving for
their second TD, a score which
would have given them a two
touchdown advantage.
It was Al Kirk land who threw
Michigan hacks for two losses in
one series of downs when the vis
itors were again knocking at pay
diit in the second half.
Then it was pass interceptions by
Hob Hoegh, Joe St. Ceme, and
Chuck Essegian which staved off
other penetrations.
The Stanford line appeared im
proved over last year's aggrega
tion and high praise is due line
coach Joe Ruet/.

Although in the final analysis it
was the passes that made the differ
ence and accounted for the scores,
Stanford's running game was one of
sustained drives and only fumbles
slowed the attack. The Indians made
203 yards on the ground, 162 in the
air.
Taylor wanted it known that
the fumbles will be cured. Work
on anti-fumbleiiis will be done
this week.
It might be that Bob Mathias, whi»
ha»s a tendency toward fumbles this
year, is in the habit of running with
his arms swinging freely as he does
in track.
It appears that Bob is not holding
the ball close enough to his body.
This if the fault, will be corrected.
Michigan was going after the ball
instead of the carrier on several
occasions. This was good football,
Taylor asserts, in view of Stanford's
tendencies to play hot potato with
the pigskin.
The fidirns' pissing game was
not all i! should have b«>en, Ga»-
rctt hit oiry Mx of 17 passes.
However, the main fault seems to
lihivc been in Garrett's sore arm,
which was injured in Wednesday's

passing scrimmage and ached a
bit. It is nothing to cause frowns,
(iarrutt's pass to John Steinberg
was a thing of beauty.
On the pass interference play, all
concerned on both the Indian and
the Michigan side agreed that M;i
thias was bumped by Wolverine
.safety man Perry. Mutiny believe
lie was pushed out of the path ol
the bull and said he thou.rht he
could have had it otherwise.
Taylor summed ui> the day's
events in the following manner:
"One, Stanford didn't play a good
game at all, and I respect Michi
gan. Michigan has great potential.
Secondly, there is no question
that the pass interference call was
u break for us. Thirdly, Michigan
was unfortunate in losing some
of their key men through inju
ries and especially Perry, who
did return later."
No Stanford player was serif usly
injured. John Stanton picked up a
new shoulder injury not thought
serious but that won't be sure until
today>
Ron Eudic's shoulder was strapped
hut could not hold up much past
the initial quarter. Bill Storum had
knee trouble and left the game in
the third period. All should he in
tip-top shape next week, together
with Skip Crist, for the Oregon
State game.
An OSC surprise showing in
hising to Michigan State by only
H-17 marks it as a toil!-,hie and
as Chuck said, ' it looks like we
just are net going to get any
breathers."
Frosh Coach Bob Ghilotti scouted
the Beavers this week and last, bul
won't return from the north land
until today.
The crowd numbered a disap
pointing !!7,000. In 1!)40 when
Michigan was in the Stadium
8(1,000 came to watch the doirfts.
There is no doubt that yesterday's
telecast of the game, combined with
the morning World Series affair on
TV, kept thousands confined to the
comfort of their living rooms.

about the Michigan 40-yard line, appeared touchdown bound until Lowell Parry, Wolverine
safety, got a little over-anxious and jabbed Mathias (panel one) before the ball got there. Pass
interference was promptly called and Stanford got the ball on the Michigan one. On the next
play Big Bob crashed over for the deciding touchdown, putting the Indians ahead to stay. Coach

lent afternoon's work.
It was John Stanton, Al lvirk
laud, and sophomore guards Win
Wedge and Matt Armitage and in
fact the entire defensive unit
which deserved qiajcr credit for
the win.
It was Stanton who, despite being
partially blocked, threw a Michigan
player for a nine-yard loss when
the Wolverines were driving for
their second TD, a score which
would have given them a two
touchdown advantage.
It was Al Kirk land who threw
Michigan hacks for two losses in
one series of downs when the vis
itors were again knocking at pay
diit in the second half.
Then it was pass interceptions by
Hob Hoegh, Joe St. Ceme, and
Chuck Essegian which staved off
other penetrations.
The Stanford line appeared im
proved over last year's aggrega
tion and high praise is due line
coach Joe Ruet/.

Although in the final analysis it
was the passes that made the differ
ence and accounted for the scores,
Stanford's running game was one of
sustained drives and only fumbles
slowed the attack. The Indians made
203 yards on the ground, 162 in the
air.
Taylor wanted it known that
the fumbles will be cured. Work
on anti-fumbleiiis will be done
this week.
It might be that Bob Mathias, whi»
ha»s a tendency toward fumbles this
year, is in the habit of running with
his arms swinging freely as he does
in track.
It appears that Bob is not holding
the ball close enough to his body.
This if the fault, will be corrected.
Michigan was going after the ball
instead of the carrier on several

Taylor asserts, in view of Stanford's

year, is in the habit of running with
his arms swinging freely as he does
in track.
It appears that Bob is not holding
the ball close enough to his body.
This if the fault, will be corrected.
Michigan was going after the ball
instead of the carrier on several
occasions. This was good football,
Taylor asserts, in view of Stanford's
tendencies to play hot potato with
the pigskin.

However, the main fault seems to

passing scrimmage and ached a
bit. It is nothing to cause frowns,
(iarrutt's pass to John Steinberg
was a thing of beauty.
On the pass interference play, all
concerned on both the Indian and
the Michigan side agreed that M;i
thias was bumped by Wolverine
.safety man Perry. Mutiny believe
lie was pushed out of the path ol
the bull and said he thou.rht he
could have had it otherwise.
Taylor summed ui> the day's
events in the following manner:
"One, Stanford didn't play a good
game at all, and I respect Michi
gan. Michigan has great potential.
Secondly, there is no question
that the pass interference call was
u break for us. Thirdly, Michigan
was unfortunate in losing some
of their key men through inju
ries and especially Perry, who
did return later."
No Stanford player was serif usly
injured. John Stanton picked up a
new shoulder injury not thought
serious but that won't be sure until
today>
Ron Eudic's shoulder was strapped
hut could not hold up much past
the initial quarter. Bill Storum had
knee trouble and left the game in
the third period. All should he in
tip-top shape next week, together
with Skip Crist, for the Oregon
State game.
An OSC surprise showing in
hising to Michigan State by only
H-17 marks it as a toil!-,hie and
as Chuck said, ' it looks like we
just are net going to get any
breathers."
Frosh Coach Bob Ghilotti scouted
the Beavers this week and last, bul
won't return from the north land
until today.
The crowd numbered a disap
pointing !!7,000. In 1!)40 when
Michigan was in the Stadium
8(1,000 came to watch the doirfts.
There is no doubt that yesterday's
telecast of the game, combined with
the morning World Series affair on
TV, kept thousands confined to the
comfort of their living rooms.

TURNING POINT Key piay of the game Saiurday was the one above in which Stanford's Bob
Mathias tried to latch onto one of quarterback Bob Garrett's long heaves. The pass, thrown from
about the Michigan 40-yard line, appeared touchdown bound until Lowell Parry, Wolverine
safety, got a little over-anxious and jabbed Mathias (panel one) before the ball got there. Pass
interference was promptly called and Stanford got the ball on the Michigan one. On the next
play Big Bob crashed over for the deciding touchdown, putting the Indians ahead to stay. Coach
Bennie Oosterbaan and Parry both agreed that body contact had taken place and that the call
was justified. Mathias said he felt an arm in his back.
