# Defense Halts Michigan; Leads 14 to 7 Triumph
## TD Comes On Interference 
### LARRY CAHN Daily Sports Editor 
Michigan came west, ran
smack into a group of Indians
who wouldn't give up anything,
and was sent back to Ann Arbor
on the short end of a 14-7 score
Saturday.
Stanford's defensive unit, which
was awfully tough when it had to
he, was the chief factor in giving
the Cards their third win of the
season, said head man Chuck Tay
lor.
It was the defensive unit which
held the victors to \'<L2 yards on
the ground, 40 less than they got
last week against Michigan State.
And for a Big Ten power club to
be limited to 122 yards is an excel
lent afternoon's work.
It was John Stanton, Al lvirk
laud, and sophomore guards Win
Wedge and Matt Armitage and in
fact the entire defensive unit
which deserved qiajcr credit for
the win.
It was Stanton who, despite being
partially blocked, threw a Michigan
player for a nine-yard loss when
the Wolverines were driving for
their second TD, a score which
would have given them a two
touchdown advantage.
It was Al Kirk land who threw
Michigan hacks for two losses in
one series of downs when the vis
itors were again knocking at pay
diit in the second half.
Then it was pass interceptions by
Hob Hoegh, Joe St. Ceme, and
Chuck Essegian which staved off
other penetrations.
The Stanford line appeared im
proved over last year's aggrega
tion and high praise is due line
coach Joe Ruet/.

Although in the final analysis it
was the passes that made the differ
ence and accounted for the scores,
Stanford's running game was one of
sustained drives and only fumbles
slowed the attack. The Indians made
203 yards on the ground, 162 in the
air.
Taylor wanted it known that
the fumbles will be cured. Work
on anti-fumbleiiis will be done
this week.
It might be that Bob Mathias, whi»
ha»s a tendency toward fumbles this
year, is in the habit of running with
his arms swinging freely as he does
in track.
It appears that Bob is not holding
the ball close enough to his body.
This if the fault, will be corrected.
Michigan was going after the ball
instead of the carrier on several
occasions. This was good football,
Taylor asserts, in view of Stanford's
tendencies to play hot potato with
the pigskin.
The fidirns' pissing game was
not all i! should have b«>en, Ga»-

However, the main fault seems to
lihivc been in Garrett's sore arm,
which was injured in Wednesday's
