# Truman's Right to Tell His Side
## 
### 
President Truman is currently touring Cali
fornia on his nation-wide whistle stop cam
paign. And wherever he goes, he is accused
of debasing his office by engaging in a politi
cal campaign in a frank and outspoken manner.
Wo defend the President's riylit to bring his
rase before the American people.
President Truman is not making his trip on
false pretenses. He declares frankly and open
ly that his intentions are political, that he is
.••peaking as the leader of the Democratic party,
not as a bi-partisan official.
(Actually, we consider this more admirable
than the actions of military heroes who inject
party arguments into what they announce as
"non-political" speeches.)
The groups who malign Harry Truman's
campaign do not consider that they are debas
ing the office v/hen they insult the President
and his record. How can he be denied the
ric/ht to defend himself?

We do not feel the President should be re
guired to i>it docilely in Washington humbly
hearing his whole administration called cor
rupt and inefficient.
Instead we applaud his attempt to take Iris
side of the stoiy directly to the voters.
We also applaud the encouragement his ac
tions have given to the whittle stop technique
as used by both parlies, foi we consider it a
fine and democratic thing when people
throughout the nation can gather in their own
home towns to hear their leaders.
We do not condone mud slinging and invec
tive on the part of either party. But we do feel
the voters should have the right to see for
themselves if mud is actually being slung —
and if it is, the men who are doing the slinging.
The voters should have the right to hear all
sides—so they can decide for themselves who
they want to lead them.— Dorothy Dodge
