# Awards for the Champion Crew
## 
### 
It's history that Jim Fifer and Dewey Hecht,
together with alumnus Jim Beggs as coach and
coxswain, won the national championship in
"pair-oared shells with cox" last summer while
representing Stanford; and thereby also won
the right to represent the United States in
Olympic competition in this event.
Stanford is now left with the matter of re
warding them for their achievements.
A proposal to give the championship crew
Block "S" awards has been given to Excorn.
At its first meeting of the quarter last Wednes
day night, this proposal v/as referred to the
Student Athletic Committee.
There is nothing in the ASSU constitution

or by laws providing for or prohibiting some
sort of suitable victory award for minor sports,
even minor sports that are not University sup
ported.
Consequently, the matter seems to be left
to the discretion of the Student Athletic Com
mittee.
We believe that the Block "S" award will be
suitable recognition for this championship
crew.
We urge any of you who share our view to
contact the members of the Student Athletic
Committee—Ron Cook, Dick Weismann, Skip
Crist, Pete Groihe, Dorothy Dodge, and Gordon
Dickie—and yive them your suggestion.
