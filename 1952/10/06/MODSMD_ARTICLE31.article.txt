### PETE GROTHE 
AUTUMN CAMPUS CANDID
The leaves, like the stoplights, turning from green
to yellow to red ... the red-sweatered Robleite stand
ing near the boathouse, remarking unbelievingly to
h' i" friend, "But in the picture in the Frosh Bible there
v/ss water in Lake Lagunita . . ."
Two pro-Stevenson poly sci majors lying cn the
lav/11 in front of the main libe, arguing with a duet
of biz schoolers who are for Eisenhower . . . the crisp,

r:y/pet air on a sunny fall after
noon . . . the senior coed, who,
trying to resurrect a fading sum
mer lan, lalls asleep under the sun
lamp and loses it all . . .
Well over a hundred gridders,
groaning, bellowing, grunting,
panting, and losing a total of
about 500 pounds of perspiration
in one afternoon's practice . . .
tho curly-haired freshman, en
route to his western civ class in

the history corner basement, finding out the hard way
that what he thought was the entrance to the base
ment is actually the women's room . . .
Saturdays: red feathers, pom poms, white saddle
â€¢hoe;;, rooters caps, and megaphones . . . the look
o.i a rally com-er's face when a p;old card turns up
ii a yea of red . . . the heart-in-the-throat feeling
juct before the kiekoft' . . . the inevitable public
address announcement that someone left his motor
running . . . * fiat moment of pride when the red

and-white-clad griddcrs gallop onto the turf . . .
Two soph gals comparing snapshots on their sum
mer in Europe ant! "just dying" upon discovering that
they were both in Paris at the same time and didn't
look each other up ... a senior hearing a "to hell
with 's(>" and a "to hell with '55" exchanged and [hid
ing it incredible to believe that not so long ago he
was saying "to hell with '52." . . .
The grizzled grad, remarking to a friend, "If we
don't beat Cal this year, I slash both my wrists."
. . . the lanky freshman from Los Angeles, exclaim
ing in shocked disbelief, "J never thought Rosotti's
would be like this!" . . . the massive oak in front of
the main libe, standing in unconcerned muteness to
all that goes on around it . . .
Three senior men agreeing that "the old place
isn't quite the same without the Class of 'iil! around"
... a smug transfer, thinking that he has all the
Stanford phraseology down pal, casually suggesting
to a girl that diey go to "The Omelette" that evening
... A foreign scholar from CJermany, becoming
Americanized and changing his name from I'lwald
to Ed.
A Chapel service on a pleasant Autumn Sunday
. . . A goggle-eyed Branner freshman, asking her
sponsor, "But why can't I wear my high school ring?"
. . . an Autumn leaf, twirling across the road like a
drunken ballet dancer . . .
Stanford is more than buildings, books, and grounds.
It's the little campus candids that we see every day,
but never really quite see because they're no clor.e.
