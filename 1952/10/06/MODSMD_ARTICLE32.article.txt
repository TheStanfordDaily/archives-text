## Complaint from a Married Student 
### 
To the Editor:
Attention: Stanford Athletic Department. The mar
ried student is reminded each football .season of the
inconsideration shown by the Stanford Athletic De
partment. Why are we placed practically in the end
/.one, separated Iroin our fellow looters by the gen
eral public. It's a sickening feeling to see the general
public being shown preference at practically the same
price. 11 it's Stanford's intention to cause unrest and
disgust among the married group, they've certainly
succeeded.

To the Editor:
1 found it both distasteful and unnecessary to see
the i'lodger pitcher referred to as "Brooklyn's fire
balling Negro, Joe Black" in the October 2 Daily.
Although the accompanying phrase was compliment
ary, the reference to race seemed entirely incongru
ous.
Perhaps college newspapers can set an example for
the press of Ihe nation by refraining from emphasiz
ing the race ol an individual in either favorable or
unfavorable newspaper accounts, when the subjects
are unrelated to racial questions.
