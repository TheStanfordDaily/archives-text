# 'Dead' Cigarette Sets Village Room Afire
## 
### WIN GRIFFITH 
Shortly before noon yesterday, a freshman resident of Stanford
Village Building 212-A mashed the end of his burning cigarette
against the ash tray and watched the "last" curls of smcke rise
from its twisted shape.
He spent the next few minutes collecting the equipment he

needed for an afternoon beach par
ty. Then, before closing the door, he
glanced at. the messy ash tray and,
in a last conscientious effort for
neatness, emptied the "dead" cigar
ette stubs in the wastebasket.
One spark, in one cigarette, in a
wastebasket filled with paper,
caught the cool breeze from an
open window and began to grow.
A half-hour later, the freshman
returned to learn the story from
one of the Mtnlo Park firemen.
Fortunately, the automatic sprin
kler system had been .set working
by the heat of the blaze and limited
it to the freshman's room.
Fortunately, the fire department
was only a few hundred yards away
oiid was able to stifle the last flames
in a few minutes.
iiut. the freshman resident of
Huilding 212-A learned that damage
to book', desk, room, and tedding
came to an unfortunately high
sum.
Fire officials estimated the amount
of the damage at $100 to $150.
