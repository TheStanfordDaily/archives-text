# INDIANS 'FANCY'â€”MICHIGAN
## Own Fumbling Mistakes Anger Beaten Invaders 
### 
The scene in the Michigan dressing room after the game was
one of anger and disgust; not at Stanford, and not at the officials,
but at themselves. "Our own mistakes cost us. We just couldn't
keep driving."
Asked to compare Stanford with Michigan Slate, the Wolver-

ines opponent last week, the Michi
gan players said that State was
"rou; her," and Stanford, "fancier."
The calmest man in the dressing
room was coach Benny Oosterbaan,
who accepted the defeat with the
philosophical serenity of a coach who
is sure of his job.
Oosterbaan first made it clear that
he agreed with the interference call
on safety-man Lowell Perry in the
last quarter, that put the ball on the
one-yard line.
He was most concerned with the
injuries to Jim Stribe and Lowell
Parry which marred the game. He
expressed hope that Perry along with
injured wingbaeks Frank Howell and
Tom Witherspoon would be in shape
for next week's battle with Indiana.
He v.as at a loss to explain the
thirteen fumbles which marked the
game. The ball was dry and the turf
fast.
Finally, he said that the team suf
fered a natural letdown after last
week's bruising battle with Michigan
State's Spartans.
However, he emphatically stated
that injuries, fumbles, and letdowns,
notwithstanding, he felt that Stan
ford played a great game. He said
that Stanford seemed to have a
' more poised" team than last year,
and that in Bob Garrett, Stanford
had found another great passer. He
praised the running of Bob Mathias,
and the general ruggedness of the
Stanford defense.
Line coach Jack Blott went even
farther as he called this year's team
stronger than last year's.
Oosterbaan also praised the coach
ing of Chuck Taylor, saying, "Of
course, he's known all over the na
tion as a fine coach, and it looks like
he's come up with another winner."
