EN ROUTE TRUMAN SPE-
ClAL—President Truman whis
tle-stopped through five Califor
nia towns yesterday, complet
ing his tour of the Far West dur
ing which he characterized Gen
eral Eisenhower as a "personal
tragedy."
Delivering two major addresses
Saturday, one in San Francisco and
the other in Oakland, President Tru
man leveled perhaps his most scorch
ing blasts at the Republicans since
the inception of this year's campaign.

| Noted for his "give 'em hell"
speeches, Truman stirred brimstone
i when he described GOP policies as
being the product of "dinosaur think
ing."
In his first speech Saturday, be
fore 1,000 Democratic party leaders
at the Palace hotel in San Francisco,
Truman lambasted the Republicans,
charging that dominating elements in
the GOP are "various business and
industrial groups whose attention is
concentrated on the advancement of
their own special interests."
To support his contention, the
President quoted Eisenhower as
saying "If all that Americans want
is security they can go to prison.
They'll have enough to cat, a bed,
and a roof over their heads."
Then, with a sly look over the top
of his glasses, the President added,
"I wonder how many people would
go to jail to get security. I don't see
anyone volunteering."
Then, provoking loud applause
from the assembled Democrats, he
shouted, "We all want this nation to
hold fast to the basic objectives of
the New Deal and the Fair Deal—
a decent living and a decent oppor
tunity for all our neighbors."
Referring to General Eisenhower,
Truinan said, lie had surrendered
to special interests. "It is a tragedy
of an able and amiable human
being, torn out of the life he was
trained to follow and shoved
around as a tool of others."
The President said he thought the
so called reactionary wing of the
Rwpublican party had been defeated
at the July GOP convention.
"If they had nominated your good
Governor, Earl Warren, it would
have been clear that the National
Republican party was on the way
to give real recognition to its much
abused liberal wing. But they turned
away from your liberal Governor,
and chose another Californian who
is not worthy to lace his shoes."
The obvious crack at Senator
Richard Nixon, the GOP vice pres
idential candidate, was greeted
with enthusiastic applause.
In fact, most of what Truman said
provoked applause.
The vitality of his manner, the curt
wag of his head, the firm clamp of
his jaw, the emphatic wave of his
hands, encouraged immediate and
warm response from all who heard
him.
The major speech of his western
tour was delivered Saturday night
in Oakland before 7,000 persons who
jammed the Municipal Auditorium.
In that speech, he thoroughly
roastcd Eisenhower for alleged
switches in his foreign policy stand
and roundly defended the foreign
policy record of his administration.
He began the speech by saying. "I
was never more serious about any
thing in my life. I believe this coun
try is facing a great danger—and that
the best hope of meeting it is to have
a Democratic victory this fall."
And the President appeared dead
serious. Unlike the noon .speech
when the President laughed and
joked throughout most of the talk,
the evening speech was solemn and
delivered in quiet, well measured
tones.
Describing the intent of adminis
tration foreign policy, Truman said,
"We undertook to restore the po
litical and economic strength of the
free nations—that they might de
fend themselves better against the
attacks of communism from within
and without.
"We have built a great alliance,
under which most of the free nations
of the world are firmly banded to
gether for our mutual defense. This
is, I believe, the most magnificent
diplomatic achievement in history."
"For making this possible we
shall be forever indebted to two of
the greatest secretaries of state this
nation ever had—General George C.
Marshall and Dean Acheson."
At that, the great crowd exploded
into a full minute of rousing ap
plause.
The only tragic exception, the

President said, was that of China,
lie pointed out that more than two
billion dollars of economic and
military aid had been sent China.
"We helped China, but China
proved unable to help itself," he
asserted.
The crucial test of our foreign
policy, he said, came with the in
vasion of South Korea in June 1950.
"By meeting aggression in Korea,
we have saved the free nations of
Asia from catastrophe."
Drawing a sight on Ike. he said,
"It is very dangerous to lead people
to think there is some magical way
out of the present struggle. It is an
injury to our national security to
tear down the confidence of people
in those policies of defense which
we have all worked so long and so
successfully to put into effect."
"But that is what the Republican
candidate is doing—and I'm not going
to let him do it,"he exclaimed.
The President said Eisenhower, as
ranking military officer in Europe
during the war and as Chief of Staff
in 11347, was responsible for many of
the decisions which he now attacks.
Truman said he did not want to
detract from Eisenhower's achieve
ments but added, ". . . when he turns
around and slanders our national ef
fort as a procession of blunders and
failures, then I am going to call him
on it."
He decried Eisenhower's complaint
that the Stale Department is to blame
for not securing open and free access
into Berlin.
The responsibility for providing
such access, said the President, lay
squarely on Eisenhower's shoulders
—and he called on Eisenhower to
step up and share some of the
hlanic.
Of Korea, Truman said the decis
ion to withdraw troops from there in
15)48 came at the advice of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff then headed by Ei
senhower.
It was Eisenhower, Truman said,
who helped convince the administra
tion that the Russians constituted no
threat to our security. He quoted

Eisenhower as saying, "We have
nothing to fear from the Russians."
Truman said Eisenhower got the
Republican nomination because he
had become a "prominent ligure in
our foreign policy."
"Then having achieved the nom
ination. he tell into the hands of
the Republican snollygosters. And
they convinced him that he couldn't
get elected unless he campaigned
on the theory that our foreign
policy is a failure."
"So he is going around the country,
campaigning against his own record
and his own principles."
Yesterday's whistle-stops, at Niles,
Stockton, Sacramento, Marysville.
Oroville, Keddie, Portola, and Win
nemucca, Nevada, were short affairs,
with the President appearing on the
rear platform of his 16-car train to
smile and wave. He delivered no
talks.

a Democratic victory this fall."
And the President appeared dead
serious. Unlike the noon .speech
when the President laughed and
joked throughout most of the talk,
the evening speech was solemn and
delivered in quiet, well measured
tones.
Describing the intent of adminis
tration foreign policy, Truman said,
"We undertook to restore the po
litical and economic strength of the
free nations—that they might de
fend themselves better against the
attacks of communism from within
and without.
"We have built a great alliance,
under which most of the free nations
of the world are firmly banded to
gether for our mutual defense. This
is, I believe, the most magnificent
diplomatic achievement in history."
"For making this possible we
shall be forever indebted to two of
the greatest secretaries of state this
nation ever had—General George C.
Marshall and Dean Acheson."
At that, the great crowd exploded
into a full minute of rousing ap
plause.
The only tragic exception, the

President said, was that of China,
lie pointed out that more than two
billion dollars of economic and
military aid had been sent China.
"We helped China, but China
proved unable to help itself," he
asserted.
The crucial test of our foreign
policy, he said, came with the in
vasion of South Korea in June 1950.
"By meeting aggression in Korea,
we have saved the free nations of
Asia from catastrophe."
Drawing a sight on Ike. he said,
"It is very dangerous to lead people
to think there is some magical way
out of the present struggle. It is an
injury to our national security to
tear down the confidence of people
in those policies of defense which
we have all worked so long and so
successfully to put into effect."
"But that is what the Republican
candidate is doing—and I'm not going
to let him do it,"he exclaimed.
The President said Eisenhower, as
ranking military officer in Europe
during the war and as Chief of Staff
in 11347, was responsible for many of
the decisions which he now attacks.
Truman said he did not want to
detract from Eisenhower's achieve
ments but added, ". . . when he turns
around and slanders our national ef
fort as a procession of blunders and
failures, then I am going to call him
on it."
He decried Eisenhower's complaint
that the Stale Department is to blame
for not securing open and free access
into Berlin.
The responsibility for providing
such access, said the President, lay
squarely on Eisenhower's shoulders
—and he called on Eisenhower to
step up and share some of the
hlanic.
Of Korea, Truman said the decis
ion to withdraw troops from there in
15)48 came at the advice of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff then headed by Ei
senhower.
It was Eisenhower, Truman said,
who helped convince the administra
tion that the Russians constituted no
threat to our security. He quoted

Eisenhower as saying, "We have
nothing to fear from the Russians."
Truman said Eisenhower got the
Republican nomination because he
had become a "prominent ligure in
our foreign policy."
"Then having achieved the nom
ination. he tell into the hands of
the Republican snollygosters. And
they convinced him that he couldn't
get elected unless he campaigned
on the theory that our foreign
policy is a failure."
"So he is going around the country,
campaigning against his own record
and his own principles."
Yesterday's whistle-stops, at Niles,
Stockton, Sacramento, Marysville.
Oroville, Keddie, Portola, and Win
nemucca, Nevada, were short affairs,
with the President appearing on the
rear platform of his 16-car train to
smile and wave. He delivered no
talks.

EN ROUTE TRUMAN SPE-
ClAL—President Truman whis
tle-stopped through five Califor
nia towns yesterday, complet
ing his tour of the Far West dur
ing which he characterized Gen
eral Eisenhower as a "personal
tragedy."
Delivering two major addresses
Saturday, one in San Francisco and
the other in Oakland, President Tru
man leveled perhaps his most scorch
ing blasts at the Republicans since
the inception of this year's campaign.

| Noted for his "give 'em hell"
speeches, Truman stirred brimstone
i when he described GOP policies as
being the product of "dinosaur think
ing."
In his first speech Saturday, be
fore 1,000 Democratic party leaders
at the Palace hotel in San Francisco,
Truman lambasted the Republicans,
charging that dominating elements in
the GOP are "various business and
industrial groups whose attention is
concentrated on the advancement of
their own special interests."
To support his contention, the
President quoted Eisenhower as
saying "If all that Americans want
is security they can go to prison.
They'll have enough to cat, a bed,
and a roof over their heads."
Then, with a sly look over the top
of his glasses, the President added,
"I wonder how many people would
go to jail to get security. I don't see
anyone volunteering."
Then, provoking loud applause
from the assembled Democrats, he
shouted, "We all want this nation to
hold fast to the basic objectives of
the New Deal and the Fair Deal—
a decent living and a decent oppor
tunity for all our neighbors."
Referring to General Eisenhower,
Truinan said, lie had surrendered
to special interests. "It is a tragedy
of an able and amiable human
being, torn out of the life he was
trained to follow and shoved
around as a tool of others."
The President said he thought the
so called reactionary wing of the
Rwpublican party had been defeated
at the July GOP convention.
"If they had nominated your good
Governor, Earl Warren, it would
have been clear that the National
Republican party was on the way
to give real recognition to its much
abused liberal wing. But they turned
away from your liberal Governor,
and chose another Californian who
is not worthy to lace his shoes."
The obvious crack at Senator
Richard Nixon, the GOP vice pres
idential candidate, was greeted
with enthusiastic applause.
In fact, most of what Truman said
provoked applause.
The vitality of his manner, the curt
wag of his head, the firm clamp of
his jaw, the emphatic wave of his
hands, encouraged immediate and
warm response from all who heard
him.
The major speech of his western
tour was delivered Saturday night
in Oakland before 7,000 persons who
jammed the Municipal Auditorium.
In that speech, he thoroughly
roastcd Eisenhower for alleged
switches in his foreign policy stand
and roundly defended the foreign
policy record of his administration.
He began the speech by saying. "I
was never more serious about any
thing in my life. I believe this coun
try is facing a great danger—and that
the best hope of meeting it is to have
a Democratic victory this fall."

EN ROUTE TRUMAN SPE-
ClAL—President Truman whis
tle-stopped through five Califor
nia towns yesterday, complet
ing his tour of the Far West dur
ing which he characterized Gen
eral Eisenhower as a "personal
tragedy."
Delivering two major addresses
Saturday, one in San Francisco and
the other in Oakland, President Tru
man leveled perhaps his most scorch
ing blasts at the Republicans since
the inception of this year's campaign.

| Noted for his "give 'em hell"
speeches, Truman stirred brimstone
i when he described GOP policies as
being the product of "dinosaur think
ing."
In his first speech Saturday, be
fore 1,000 Democratic party leaders
at the Palace hotel in San Francisco,
Truman lambasted the Republicans,
charging that dominating elements in
the GOP are "various business and
industrial groups whose attention is
concentrated on the advancement of
their own special interests."
To support his contention, the
President quoted Eisenhower as
saying "If all that Americans want
is security they can go to prison.
They'll have enough to cat, a bed,
and a roof over their heads."
Then, with a sly look over the top
of his glasses, the President added,
"I wonder how many people would
go to jail to get security. I don't see
anyone volunteering."
Then, provoking loud applause
from the assembled Democrats, he
shouted, "We all want this nation to
hold fast to the basic objectives of
the New Deal and the Fair Deal—
a decent living and a decent oppor
tunity for all our neighbors."
Referring to General Eisenhower,
Truinan said, lie had surrendered
to special interests. "It is a tragedy
of an able and amiable human
being, torn out of the life he was
trained to follow and shoved
around as a tool of others."
The President said he thought the
so called reactionary wing of the
Rwpublican party had been defeated
at the July GOP convention.
"If they had nominated your good
Governor, Earl Warren, it would
have been clear that the National
Republican party was on the way
to give real recognition to its much
abused liberal wing. But they turned
away from your liberal Governor,
and chose another Californian who
is not worthy to lace his shoes."
The obvious crack at Senator
Richard Nixon, the GOP vice pres
idential candidate, was greeted
with enthusiastic applause.
In fact, most of what Truman said
provoked applause.
The vitality of his manner, the curt
wag of his head, the firm clamp of
his jaw, the emphatic wave of his
hands, encouraged immediate and
warm response from all who heard
him.
The major speech of his western
tour was delivered Saturday night
in Oakland before 7,000 persons who
jammed the Municipal Auditorium.
In that speech, he thoroughly
roastcd Eisenhower for alleged
switches in his foreign policy stand
and roundly defended the foreign
policy record of his administration.
He began the speech by saying. "I
was never more serious about any
thing in my life. I believe this coun
try is facing a great danger—and that
the best hope of meeting it is to have
a Democratic victory this fall."
And the President appeared dead
serious. Unlike the noon .speech
when the President laughed and
joked throughout most of the talk,
the evening speech was solemn and
delivered in quiet, well measured
tones.
Describing the intent of adminis
tration foreign policy, Truman said,
"We undertook to restore the po
litical and economic strength of the
free nations—that they might de
fend themselves better against the
attacks of communism from within
and without.
"We have built a great alliance,
under which most of the free nations
of the world are firmly banded to
gether for our mutual defense. This
is, I believe, the most magnificent
diplomatic achievement in history."
"For making this possible we
shall be forever indebted to two of
the greatest secretaries of state this
nation ever had—General George C.
Marshall and Dean Acheson."
At that, the great crowd exploded
into a full minute of rousing ap
plause.
The only tragic exception, the

President said, was that of China,
lie pointed out that more than two
billion dollars of economic and
military aid had been sent China.
"We helped China, but China
proved unable to help itself," he
asserted.
The crucial test of our foreign
policy, he said, came with the in
vasion of South Korea in June 1950.
"By meeting aggression in Korea,
we have saved the free nations of
Asia from catastrophe."
Drawing a sight on Ike. he said,
"It is very dangerous to lead people
to think there is some magical way
out of the present struggle. It is an
injury to our national security to
tear down the confidence of people
in those policies of defense which
we have all worked so long and so
successfully to put into effect."
"But that is what the Republican
candidate is doing—and I'm not going
to let him do it,"he exclaimed.
The President said Eisenhower, as
ranking military officer in Europe
during the war and as Chief of Staff
in 11347, was responsible for many of
the decisions which he now attacks.
Truman said he did not want to
detract from Eisenhower's achieve
ments but added, ". . . when he turns
around and slanders our national ef
fort as a procession of blunders and
failures, then I am going to call him
on it."
He decried Eisenhower's complaint
that the Stale Department is to blame
for not securing open and free access
into Berlin.
The responsibility for providing
such access, said the President, lay
squarely on Eisenhower's shoulders
—and he called on Eisenhower to
step up and share some of the
hlanic.
Of Korea, Truman said the decis
ion to withdraw troops from there in
15)48 came at the advice of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff then headed by Ei
senhower.
It was Eisenhower, Truman said,
who helped convince the administra
tion that the Russians constituted no
threat to our security. He quoted

Eisenhower as saying, "We have
nothing to fear from the Russians."
Truman said Eisenhower got the
Republican nomination because he
had become a "prominent ligure in
our foreign policy."
"Then having achieved the nom
ination. he tell into the hands of

is not worthy to lace his shoes."
The obvious crack at Senator
Richard Nixon, the GOP vice pres
idential candidate, was greeted
with enthusiastic applause.
In fact, most of what Truman said
provoked applause.
The vitality of his manner, the curt
wag of his head, the firm clamp of
his jaw, the emphatic wave of his
hands, encouraged immediate and
warm response from all who heard
him.
The major speech of his western
tour was delivered Saturday night
in Oakland before 7,000 persons who
jammed the Municipal Auditorium.
In that speech, he thoroughly
roastcd Eisenhower for alleged
switches in his foreign policy stand
and roundly defended the foreign
policy record of his administration.
He began the speech by saying. "I
was never more serious about any
thing in my life. I believe this coun
try is facing a great danger—and that
the best hope of meeting it is to have
a Democratic victory this fall."
And the President appeared dead
serious. Unlike the noon .speech
when the President laughed and
joked throughout most of the talk,
the evening speech was solemn and
delivered in quiet, well measured
tones.
Describing the intent of adminis
tration foreign policy, Truman said,
"We undertook to restore the po
litical and economic strength of the
free nations—that they might de
fend themselves better against the
attacks of communism from within
and without.
"We have built a great alliance,
under which most of the free nations
of the world are firmly banded to
gether for our mutual defense. This
is, I believe, the most magnificent
diplomatic achievement in history."
"For making this possible we
shall be forever indebted to two of
the greatest secretaries of state this
nation ever had—General George C.
Marshall and Dean Acheson."
At that, the great crowd exploded
into a full minute of rousing ap
plause.
The only tragic exception, the

President said, was that of China,
lie pointed out that more than two
billion dollars of economic and
military aid had been sent China.
"We helped China, but China
proved unable to help itself," he
asserted.
The crucial test of our foreign
policy, he said, came with the in
vasion of South Korea in June 1950.
"By meeting aggression in Korea,
we have saved the free nations of
Asia from catastrophe."
Drawing a sight on Ike. he said,
"It is very dangerous to lead people
to think there is some magical way
out of the present struggle. It is an
injury to our national security to
tear down the confidence of people
in those policies of defense which
we have all worked so long and so
successfully to put into effect."
"But that is what the Republican
candidate is doing—and I'm not going
to let him do it,"he exclaimed.
The President said Eisenhower, as
ranking military officer in Europe
during the war and as Chief of Staff
in 11347, was responsible for many of
the decisions which he now attacks.
Truman said he did not want to
detract from Eisenhower's achieve
ments but added, ". . . when he turns
around and slanders our national ef
fort as a procession of blunders and
failures, then I am going to call him
on it."
He decried Eisenhower's complaint
that the Stale Department is to blame
for not securing open and free access
into Berlin.
The responsibility for providing
such access, said the President, lay
squarely on Eisenhower's shoulders
—and he called on Eisenhower to
step up and share some of the
hlanic.
Of Korea, Truman said the decis
ion to withdraw troops from there in
15)48 came at the advice of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff then headed by Ei
senhower.
It was Eisenhower, Truman said,
who helped convince the administra
tion that the Russians constituted no
threat to our security. He quoted

Eisenhower as saying, "We have
nothing to fear from the Russians."
Truman said Eisenhower got the
Republican nomination because he
had become a "prominent ligure in
our foreign policy."
"Then having achieved the nom
ination. he tell into the hands of
the Republican snollygosters. And
they convinced him that he couldn't
get elected unless he campaigned
on the theory that our foreign
policy is a failure."
"So he is going around the country,
campaigning against his own record
and his own principles."
Yesterday's whistle-stops, at Niles,
Stockton, Sacramento, Marysville.
Oroville, Keddie, Portola, and Win
nemucca, Nevada, were short affairs,
with the President appearing on the
rear platform of his 16-car train to
smile and wave. He delivered no
talks.

EN ROUTE TRUMAN SPE-
ClAL—President Truman whis
tle-stopped through five Califor
nia towns yesterday, complet
ing his tour of the Far West dur
ing which he characterized Gen
eral Eisenhower as a "personal
tragedy."
Delivering two major addresses
Saturday, one in San Francisco and
the other in Oakland, President Tru
man leveled perhaps his most scorch
ing blasts at the Republicans since
the inception of this year's campaign.

| Noted for his "give 'em hell"
speeches, Truman stirred brimstone
i when he described GOP policies as
being the product of "dinosaur think
ing."
In his first speech Saturday, be
fore 1,000 Democratic party leaders
at the Palace hotel in San Francisco,
Truman lambasted the Republicans,
charging that dominating elements in
the GOP are "various business and
industrial groups whose attention is
concentrated on the advancement of
their own special interests."
To support his contention, the
President quoted Eisenhower as
saying "If all that Americans want
is security they can go to prison.
They'll have enough to cat, a bed,
and a roof over their heads."
Then, with a sly look over the top
of his glasses, the President added,
"I wonder how many people would
go to jail to get security. I don't see
anyone volunteering."
Then, provoking loud applause
from the assembled Democrats, he
shouted, "We all want this nation to
hold fast to the basic objectives of
the New Deal and the Fair Deal—
a decent living and a decent oppor
tunity for all our neighbors."
Referring to General Eisenhower,
Truinan said, lie had surrendered
to special interests. "It is a tragedy
of an able and amiable human
being, torn out of the life he was
trained to follow and shoved
around as a tool of others."
The President said he thought the
so called reactionary wing of the
Rwpublican party had been defeated
at the July GOP convention.
"If they had nominated your good
Governor, Earl Warren, it would
have been clear that the National
Republican party was on the way
to give real recognition to its much
abused liberal wing. But they turned
away from your liberal Governor,
and chose another Californian who
is not worthy to lace his shoes."
