## Chinese Reds Launch Year's Biggest Drive 
### 
TOKYO, Tuesday, Oct, 7 (UP)â€”Chinese Communists attacking
"in waves and waves" hurled 12,000 troops at United Nations posi
tions along most of the Korean battlefront last night and early today
in the biggest Red drive in a year.
The Reds slammed into the UN outpost lines with troops and

tanks and in their biggest assault,
against two hills northwest of Chor
won, poured men into the attack "in
waves and waves, shouting and
shooting wildly in all directions,"
according to eyewitnesses.
The western front attack was
beaten back after a night of savage
"free-for-all" fighting that left an
estimated 800 to 900 dead Chinese
on the battlefield.
The battles erupted along the
front with the greatest number of
men involved and the biggest sepa
rate engagements since the United
Nations and the Communists fought
last fall for a favorable line of de
marcation.
Attacking Chinese, hitting UN
lines across the front like a string
of exploding firecrackers, used bat
talions of about 700 men each dur
ing the night as they have used pla
toons, squads, and companies during
most of 1952's fighting.
Gen. Mark W. Clark's daily com
munique reported that "action in
creased considerably along the, K
orean battlefront yesterday" with "all
sectors active except the eastern
front."
No immediate explanation for the
sudden Communist surge was of
fered. There was nothing to indi
cate, however, that it was the fore
runner of any Communist attempt
to break through the deep Allied
line at any single point.
Most attacks were aimed at seiz
ing outpost hills which have been
the scene of bitter fighting all sum
mer and winter, several changing
hands many times in recent months.
