# Eisenhower Attacks 'Fair Deal' Sell-out Policy on Public Power
## Stevenson to Begin Tour Of 24 States Tomorrow 
### 
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Oct. 6 (UP) —Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson's cam
paign manager said today the Democratic nominee's drive for the
White House is "as far along as we could possibly hope at this
time."
Wilson W. Wyatt said he based the outlook on "grass roots"

reports reaching the Stevenson head
quarters here.
Wyatt talked with newsmen as the
Illinois governor prepared to start
out tomorrow on 14,450 miles of
campaign trails that will keep him
before the votex's almost continu
ously until election day Nov. 4.
Except for brief returns to Spring
field Oct. 12-13 and Oct. 19-20, the
candidate will be on the road almost
constantly, covering a total of 24
states in the final four weeks.
Following his established custom,
Stevenson will cover most of the
distance by air, except for a final
foray in the cast by train in the
closing weeks.
He also will appear on nationwide
radio and television hookups each
Tuesday and Thursday until Oct. 28
—the device the Democrats hope will
make their candidate as well known
as GOP standard-bearer Dwight D.
Eisenhower.
Stevenson worked on speeches to
day for his gruelling schedule, which
starts tomorrow with flights to Sagi
naw, Mich., and Detroit. At Detroit
he plans a major speech on the Com
munist menace.
Wyatt said that except for the
Detroit speech and one about a
week later on corruption in gov
ernment, Stevenson's closing cam
paign will be largely an elabora
tion of the issues he discussed dur
ing September.
He denied that Stevenson has been
talking "over the heads" of most of
his listeners and said Democrats are
not disturbed by the fact that Stev
enson's street crowds are often
smaller than Eisenhower's.
The nominee's final itinerary
breaks down into three parts, the
first Hking him into Michigan, Wis
consin, Missouri, Oklahoma, Louisi
ana, Florida and Tennessee.
Wyatt said many southern Demo
cratic leaders will be at a New Or
leans meeting next Friday—including
Govs. Gordon Browning of Tennes
see, Johnston Murray of Oklahoma,
Hugh White of Mississippi and Gor
don Parsons of Alabama, and Texas
Senators Tom Connally and Lyndon
Johnson.
