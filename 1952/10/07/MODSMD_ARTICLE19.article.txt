PROVO, Utah, Oct. 6 (UP) —
President Truman angrily de
clared today that criticisms of
his administration's moral char
acter were "sheer poppycock."
Mr. Truman conceded he had been
disappointed in a few of his govern
ment appointees and had been hurt
personally by their actions, but said
most of them had passed "with flying
colors." He said he was proud of the
results he had obtained and was
"confident history will bear me out."
"I hear a lot of talk about govern
ment by crony in Washington,"the
President said. "That's sheer poppy
cock—and politics."
On the other hand, he said, the
Republican party "does not seem
able to understand what it takes to
meet the menace of Communist ag
gression and subversion.
Mr. Truman delivered a pre
pared address to an overflow crowd
in Brigham Young University
stadium.
Police estimated 4.000 persons
greeted Mr. Truman and his
daughter, Margaret, at the railroad
station when the President's whistle
stop campaign train pulled in.
Another crowd, including many
grade and high school students, lined
the one-mile route from the station
to the campus, where Mr. Truman
opened the homeward half of his
cross-country "give 'em hell" cam
paign against the Republicans.
He issued a stinging rebuke t'>
those who criticize his administra
tion for alleged graft and corrup
tion and scolded the Republicans
for what he called a lack of co
operation in coping with inter
national problems.
"I have done my best, these seven
years, to keep the quality of the
federal service hi:;h to attract good
people and keep them in their jobs,
to defend them against unfair and
unproven attacks," the President
said.
"I have had some disappoint

mcnts, now and Ihen along the
way, but, overall I am proud of the
result, proud and rather confident
that history will bear me out."
Mr. Truman said he always had
tried to find the best persons avail
able for the "many complicated jobs
I have to fill."
"Of course, you know as well as 1
do that no system is mlallible," he
added.
Mr. Truman said the "underlying
difference between the Republican
and Democratic parties boils down to
a very simple thing."
"The Democratic party is a politi
cal organization that has a heart—it
cares about people—all people," he
said.
"The Republican party is ruled by
a little group of men who have cal
culating machines where their hearts
ought to be."
