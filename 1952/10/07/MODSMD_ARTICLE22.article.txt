SEATTLE, Wash., Oct. 6 (UP)—Dwight D. Eisenhower, the GOP
presidential nominee, tonight denounced the "sly apostles of fair
dealism" for trying to sell the nation a "whole hog" approach to
public power.

Rather than endorse an across

he-board program for river basin
development, Eisenhower advocated
a federal-state system of determining
how best to harness the natural re
sources of the nation.
"Such undertakings will require
genuine co-operation, but I have no
doubt that the job can be done with
an administration that is devoted to
the principle of decentralized gov
ernment and to the full develop
ment of our resources."
The former five-star general took
a slap at his former boss, Harry Tru
man, when he opened his address
with a reference to remarks made
there recently by the President.

"You have been told by an expert
in political demagoguery that I want
to turn this great northwest back to
the prairie dogs and sagebrush," he
said.
Eisenhower said "the sly apostles
of fair dealism" were trying to take
credit for inventing the idea of fed
eral participation in natural re
source development sometime with
in the past 20 years.
"How do you suppose they squat®
this with this year's celebration of
the 50th anniversary of the Bureau
of Reclamation, founded under Teddy
Roosevelt?" he asked.
The candidate said "something
new" had been added to the U.S.
scene during the last 20 yeait, and
that it was "the idea of wholo-hog
federal government."
"It is the hard core of the differ
ence between those power-seeking
politicians and the rer;t of us who
still believe in basic American in
stitutions," he said.
