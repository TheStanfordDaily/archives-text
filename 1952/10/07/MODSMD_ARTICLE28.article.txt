# A 						Six for Cardinals

### 
A big six for Cardinals!
We applaud t!.cir enterprise in breaking
precedent to hold "Back to the Farm" Week
early in fall quarter before the mid-quarter
rush sets in. Many aspects of the programâ€”
like holding the student facully baseball game,
the picnic, and the rally all conveniently in the
Sunken Diamond show good planning on the
part of Cardinals.
The yearly calendar of all - campus social
events has been the target of many gripes and
suggestions in recent months. We are happy
to see Cardinals taking some action in a posi
tive direction.
