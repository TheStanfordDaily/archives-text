After making several derogatory remarks about
historical and picturesque Encina Hall in this col
umn last week, i t'eel greatly ashamed.
Kncina has it oil over these new-fangled dorms
that have electric outlejts and wall switches, hot
water, screens, etc. After all, if there were screens,
what could we do with cigarette butts?
And anyway, dormitory life is really great. One
meets the nicest people in the shower.

A) the Reg Dance last week I heard a great many
people complaining: (1) too crowded, (2j not good
music for dancing, (3) there's not enough air in the
place to light a match.
To these malcontents I say, "Give up lighting
matches and a third of your troubles will be over."
Almost all girls like to dance, but a great many
of the males don't seem to. They say, "I dislike
dancing. After all, it's only huggin' set to music,
and you know how I hate music."

The world is but a stage, but the play is badly
cast.

In Western Civilization we were told we should
argue.
I believe that arguments are extremely vulgar,
for everybody in good society holds exactly the same
opinions. One should always avoid arguments. They
are not only vulgar but often convincing.
1 will do poorly in Civ.
Also as a general rule, I suggest that you never
argue ;.t the dinner table, for the one who is not
hungry always gets the best of the argument.

This is a column to kill time for those who like it
better dead.

The Michigan player hurt in the game Saturday
became aware of the fact that almost everybody is
strong enough to bear the misfortunes of others.
I bow and 'crape (the bottom).
