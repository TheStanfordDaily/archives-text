# CAMPUS OPINION
## 'Thanks for Co-operation, Enthusiasm' 
### 
To l ie Editor and the Student Body:
On behalf of my four assistants and myself, I
would like to thank the student body lor the co
operation and the enthusiasm shown at the rally
Friday evening and at the football game Saturday.
Several people who were seated on the Michigan
.* ide of the stadium, as well as several alums, came
up and made extremely favorable comments en the
section. In other words, we "showed them."
Many people were particularly impressed by the
fact that our section became quiet the infant the

team came u j to the line of scrimmage. I can cer
tainly ray that Mr. Taylor must have appreciated
that the section was quiet when the offense was
listening lor the snap signal from the quarterback.
I would also like to urge all of you to make the
trip down , outh for the UCLA game. The activities
planned by UCLA for that weekend are fantastic
and you'll find out their content very soon.
I! we can .vet by Oregon State this weekend, the
game down : outh will triple in national importance.
