## Punts and Pitches 
### 
Now that the autumnal carnival of over-exertion known as loot ball is
well underway, let us briefly pause and try to figure out where Stanlord
fits into the scheme of things.
First, let it be understood that the Indians are not going to the Rose
Bowl this year. Not because the tenders of the green on the Rose Bowl
turf are still cleaning out the remains of last year's Rose Bowl squad or
because we won't win the PCC, but rather because a PCC title-bearer
cannot go two years in a row to Pasadena.
This is not to say that the still-unscathed Indians will cop the Pacific
Coast gonfalon again. Cal should be favored here, with USC and UCLA
next in line.
However, there is something pleasingly reminiscent of the '51 champs
in this '52 gang.
They never bowl an opponent over. They fumble, they stutter, they
make mistakes, but, somehow or other, they come through when they

have to. And, most important, they
have a mysterious habit of being
on the long end of the score when
60 football minutes are over.
This year's Indian team, which
should end with a record of eight
and two, is fully up to the task
of knocking any of its opponents
over. And if it lives up to its
capabilities, it could easily kick the
stufling out of mighty Cal. Which,
incidentally, we are predicting it
will do.
The mouth begins to thirst after
a six year drought.
In many ways, this year's squad is

better than last year's outfit at the same time. Even Chuck Taylor, who
has an amazingly straight-forward way of curving around a direct ques
tion, admits this.
Certainly, the defensive line has promises of being the most Jack
Benny-ish in the league. They were downright miserly in giving Michi
gan anything, and Washington State was also properly thwurted. Win
Wedge and Matt Armitage, both pink-cheekej sophomore guards, have
given notice of future greatness. Al Kirklaiid has been a rock on de
fense, and Chuck Taylor wouldn't trade linebackers Ted Tanner and
Chuck Essegian for any other duo in the league.
Hon Eadie, when he is healthy, is the best defensive end in the con
ference, Also credit Bill Storum and John Broderick as being rugged to
move.
As far as blocking ability is concerned, the offensive line is on a par
with last year's outfit. However, the loss of guard Norm Manoogian for
the year hurts more than most people realize. If anyone was the in
dispensible man in the line, Norm was it.
All of which brings us to the offensive ends and the backfield. Let us
face one brutal and naked fact: Bill McColl is not here this year. And
McColl catches last year were the difference between victory- and defeat
in two or three games. We don't mean catches that any end couid make.
We mean catches that only McColl could make . . . the type where he
leaped into the heavens to claw down an aerial with a forest of defenders
hanging on his back.
we wouldn't trade piano-playing Sam Morley and team joker John
Steinberg for any other pair of ends in the conference, but the truth of
the matter is that neither is a McColl. Few people are.
The running of the halfbacks should be on a par with last years.
Harry (the Hipster) Hngasian will be missed, as will Bobby Meyers, but
Hon Cook is vastly improved over last year, Crist was hitting hard be
fore he was hurt, and Bill Rogers is a real comer.
At lullback, Bob Mathias, the world's most perfect athlete, is much
better than he was last year. Last season, he was a knifing fullback. Now
he booms. He knocks people over. Also, last week he showed signs of
doing a little darting and dancing. In short, he is a coach's dream ... he
possesses that perfect combination of size, speed, and agility. Not so per
fect, however, is his generosity in giving the opposition the ball via fumb
ling. However, Taylor assures, Mathias won't tumble from now on.
Bob Garrett, the key to Stanford attack, right now is a better passer
than Gary Kerkorian. He can't wiggle off the hook as gracefully as Ker
korian could, and Garrett is also having his fumbling troubles, but he is
well on the way to being Stanford's best quarterback since Frankie Albert.
End of comparison.

policy . . . three faculty members, three alumni, and four students. Along
with Dick Weismann, Dorothy Dodge, and Skip Crist, I am one of your
student representatives. Being just that, your representative, I should be
more than glad to listen to any ideas you have concerning the athletic setup
at Stanford. Good suggestions are abundantly welcome.

Now that the autumnal carnival of over-exertion known as loot ball is
well underway, let us briefly pause and try to figure out where Stanlord
fits into the scheme of things.
First, let it be understood that the Indians are not going to the Rose
Bowl this year. Not because the tenders of the green on the Rose Bowl
turf are still cleaning out the remains of last year's Rose Bowl squad or
because we won't win the PCC, but rather because a PCC title-bearer
cannot go two years in a row to Pasadena.
This is not to say that the still-unscathed Indians will cop the Pacific
Coast gonfalon again. Cal should be favored here, with USC and UCLA
next in line.
However, there is something pleasingly reminiscent of the '51 champs
in this '52 gang.
They never bowl an opponent over. They fumble, they stutter, they
make mistakes, but, somehow or other, they come through when they

have to. And, most important, they
have a mysterious habit of being
on the long end of the score when
60 football minutes are over.
This year's Indian team, which
should end with a record of eight
and two, is fully up to the task
of knocking any of its opponents
over. And if it lives up to its
capabilities, it could easily kick the
stufling out of mighty Cal. Which,
incidentally, we are predicting it
will do.
The mouth begins to thirst after
a six year drought.
In many ways, this year's squad is

better than last year's outfit at the same time. Even Chuck Taylor, who
has an amazingly straight-forward way of curving around a direct ques
tion, admits this.
Certainly, the defensive line has promises of being the most Jack
Benny-ish in the league. They were downright miserly in giving Michi
gan anything, and Washington State was also properly thwurted. Win
Wedge and Matt Armitage, both pink-cheekej sophomore guards, have
given notice of future greatness. Al Kirklaiid has been a rock on de
fense, and Chuck Taylor wouldn't trade linebackers Ted Tanner and
Chuck Essegian for any other duo in the league.
Hon Eadie, when he is healthy, is the best defensive end in the con
ference, Also credit Bill Storum and John Broderick as being rugged to
move.
As far as blocking ability is concerned, the offensive line is on a par
with last year's outfit. However, the loss of guard Norm Manoogian for
the year hurts more than most people realize. If anyone was the in
dispensible man in the line, Norm was it.
All of which brings us to the offensive ends and the backfield. Let us
face one brutal and naked fact: Bill McColl is not here this year. And
McColl catches last year were the difference between victory- and defeat
in two or three games. We don't mean catches that any end couid make.
We mean catches that only McColl could make . . . the type where he
leaped into the heavens to claw down an aerial with a forest of defenders
hanging on his back.
we wouldn't trade piano-playing Sam Morley and team joker John
Steinberg for any other pair of ends in the conference, but the truth of
the matter is that neither is a McColl. Few people are.
The running of the halfbacks should be on a par with last years.
Harry (the Hipster) Hngasian will be missed, as will Bobby Meyers, but
Hon Cook is vastly improved over last year, Crist was hitting hard be
fore he was hurt, and Bill Rogers is a real comer.
At lullback, Bob Mathias, the world's most perfect athlete, is much
better than he was last year. Last season, he was a knifing fullback. Now
he booms. He knocks people over. Also, last week he showed signs of
doing a little darting and dancing. In short, he is a coach's dream ... he
possesses that perfect combination of size, speed, and agility. Not so per
fect, however, is his generosity in giving the opposition the ball via fumb
ling. However, Taylor assures, Mathias won't tumble from now on.
Bob Garrett, the key to Stanford attack, right now is a better passer
than Gary Kerkorian. He can't wiggle off the hook as gracefully as Ker
korian could, and Garrett is also having his fumbling troubles, but he is
well on the way to being Stanford's best quarterback since Frankie Albert.
End of comparison.

korian could, and Garrett is also having his fumbling troubles, but he is
well on the way to being Stanford's best quarterback since Frankie Albert.
End of comparison.

Stanford Athletic Board Note.—Ten people formulate Stanford athletic
policy . . . three faculty members, three alumni, and four students. Along
with Dick Weismann, Dorothy Dodge, and Skip Crist, I am one of your
student representatives. Being just that, your representative, I should be
more than glad to listen to any ideas you have concerning the athletic setup
at Stanford. Good suggestions are abundantly welcome.

Now that the autumnal carnival of over-exertion known as loot ball is
well underway, let us briefly pause and try to figure out where Stanlord
fits into the scheme of things.
First, let it be understood that the Indians are not going to the Rose
Bowl this year. Not because the tenders of the green on the Rose Bowl
turf are still cleaning out the remains of last year's Rose Bowl squad or
because we won't win the PCC, but rather because a PCC title-bearer
cannot go two years in a row to Pasadena.
This is not to say that the still-unscathed Indians will cop the Pacific
Coast gonfalon again. Cal should be favored here, with USC and UCLA
next in line.
However, there is something pleasingly reminiscent of the '51 champs
in this '52 gang.
They never bowl an opponent over. They fumble, they stutter, they
make mistakes, but, somehow or other, they come through when they

have to. And, most important, they
have a mysterious habit of being
on the long end of the score when
60 football minutes are over.
This year's Indian team, which
should end with a record of eight
and two, is fully up to the task
of knocking any of its opponents
over. And if it lives up to its
capabilities, it could easily kick the
stufling out of mighty Cal. Which,
incidentally, we are predicting it
will do.
The mouth begins to thirst after
a six year drought.
In many ways, this year's squad is

better than last year's outfit at the same time. Even Chuck Taylor, who
has an amazingly straight-forward way of curving around a direct ques
tion, admits this.
Certainly, the defensive line has promises of being the most Jack
Benny-ish in the league. They were downright miserly in giving Michi
gan anything, and Washington State was also properly thwurted. Win
Wedge and Matt Armitage, both pink-cheekej sophomore guards, have
given notice of future greatness. Al Kirklaiid has been a rock on de
fense, and Chuck Taylor wouldn't trade linebackers Ted Tanner and
Chuck Essegian for any other duo in the league.
Hon Eadie, when he is healthy, is the best defensive end in the con
ference, Also credit Bill Storum and John Broderick as being rugged to
move.
As far as blocking ability is concerned, the offensive line is on a par
with last year's outfit. However, the loss of guard Norm Manoogian for
the year hurts more than most people realize. If anyone was the in
dispensible man in the line, Norm was it.
All of which brings us to the offensive ends and the backfield. Let us
face one brutal and naked fact: Bill McColl is not here this year. And
McColl catches last year were the difference between victory- and defeat
in two or three games. We don't mean catches that any end couid make.
We mean catches that only McColl could make . . . the type where he
leaped into the heavens to claw down an aerial with a forest of defenders
hanging on his back.
we wouldn't trade piano-playing Sam Morley and team joker John
Steinberg for any other pair of ends in the conference, but the truth of
the matter is that neither is a McColl. Few people are.
The running of the halfbacks should be on a par with last years.
Harry (the Hipster) Hngasian will be missed, as will Bobby Meyers, but
Hon Cook is vastly improved over last year, Crist was hitting hard be
fore he was hurt, and Bill Rogers is a real comer.
At lullback, Bob Mathias, the world's most perfect athlete, is much
better than he was last year. Last season, he was a knifing fullback. Now
he booms. He knocks people over. Also, last week he showed signs of
doing a little darting and dancing. In short, he is a coach's dream ... he
possesses that perfect combination of size, speed, and agility. Not so per
fect, however, is his generosity in giving the opposition the ball via fumb
ling. However, Taylor assures, Mathias won't tumble from now on.
Bob Garrett, the key to Stanford attack, right now is a better passer
than Gary Kerkorian. He can't wiggle off the hook as gracefully as Ker
korian could, and Garrett is also having his fumbling troubles, but he is
well on the way to being Stanford's best quarterback since Frankie Albert.
