# Dixie Leaders Blast Demos

### HADLEY ROFF Daily Political Editor 
(Editor's note: This is the con
cluding article in a two-part sc
ries by Political Editor Harflcy
Roll about political trends in the
South.)
In 1928, precedent was shat
tered when Texas led three oth
er Southern States, Virginia,
North Carolina, and Tennessee,
into the Republican fold and
thus helped seat Herbert Hoo
ver in the White House.
The makings of another such rev
olution are apparent this year as
many Southern politicos refuse to
support Adlai Stevenson and en
dorse the candidacy of Republican
Dwight Eisenhower.
Governor Allan Shivers of Texas
and Governor George F. Allan of
Louisiana, two of the key political
figures in Dixie, have repudiated the
Democratic candidates and have said
they will support the GOP ticket.
This rare support came at the
heels of Adlai Stevenson's visit to the
South two weeks ago when he an
nounced his support of federal con
trol of the tideland oil regions and of
FEPC.
Perhaps the most critical of the
dissatisfied Southern Democrats
has been the fiery Governor of
South Carolina, James F. Byrnes.
Byrnes, in a formal statement is
sued Sept. 18, lambasted Stevenson,
charging the Illinois Governor had
sold out to the Truman faction, and
declared his whole-hearted support
of the Republican platform and
Presidential nominee.
Byrnes, since quitting as Secre
tary of State under Truman in 1946,
has been at vicious odds with the
President.
In outlining the reasons for his
condemnation of Stevenson, Byrnes
cites Stevenson's stand on the Taft-
Hartley law, FEPC, the tidelands oil
dispute, and"the mess in Washing
ton."
Speaking of the so-called Wash
ington mess, Byrnes declared,
"Governor Stevenson would not
condone corruption. But no mat
ter how honest and ethical he is,
he could never clean up what he
has called the 'mess in Washing
ton.' He will be under too great
an obligation to those responsible
for the mess. It will take a man
like Eisenhower who is under no
political obligation to the Presi
dent or anv other official of the
Administration. . . ."
Byrnes, in his lengthy proclama
tion, said the South favors the Taft-
Hartley law and scorches Stevenson

for his insistence that the law must
be repealed.
Turning to FEPC, Byrnes insisted
such legislation is within the realm
of state authority and condemned
Stevenson's proposal for a federally
administered program.
Tidelands, Byrnes asserted, are
also within the province of states'
rights.
Byrnes concluded by saying, "I
shall not vote for a label. I shall
do what I have heretofore uvged
others to do. I shall place loyalty
to my country above loyalty to a
political party ami I shall vote for
General Eisenhower."
In 1948, the Truman-South fight
flared into ugly battle with the
South finally stomping from the
party convention that year and set
ting up its own party, the State's
Rights party.
Four states, Louisiana, Mississip
pi, Alabama, and South Carolina,
voted State's Rights.
This year there is no State's
Rights party organized with any
fighting plan. Instead, the leaders
of the 1948 revolt are leaning to
ward Ike.
The Republicans hope this sym
pathy can be stimulated into an
active, vital force, and to accom
plish this the GOP has been mov
ing its big oratorical guns into
the South.
General Eisenhower, last week,
marched to the heartland of the
South, Columbus, South Carolina,
and there severely blasted Ste
venson for his stand on civil rights
and other cankerous matters.
The GOP high command plans to
further campaign in the South, and
Eisenhower is scheduled to whistle
stop through Dixie later this month
.Though there is real dissatisfac
tion at the top of the political lad
der in the South, it is not known
how far down into the rank and file
that unrest penetrates.
It is known, however, that, for
once in the party's career, it has a
fighting chance south of the Mason
and Dixon line.
