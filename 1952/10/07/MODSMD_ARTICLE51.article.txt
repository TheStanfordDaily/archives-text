# Dramatic 'Le Sabre' Here Today
## 
### 
One of America's most dramatic
automobiles — the General Motors
"Le Sabre"—which was.designed by
a Stanford graduate, Harley J. Earl,
class of 1918, will be displayed on
Engineering corner today at 11 a.m.
and 2 p.m.
Robert McWilliams, of GM's edu
cational relations section in Detroit,
will meet with student engineers of
ASME and faculty at 2 o'clock in
Cubberley Auditorium for a special
program on automotive engineering
and design, to be followed by an
inspection and demonstration of
some of "Le Sabre's" distinctive
features.
The low, sleek sports car with
the sweeping lines of a jet aircraft
is purely experimental. It is a
' laboratory on wheels" for testing
mechanical and styling ideas that
GM designers have sketched on
drawing boards and discussed in
many engineeirng sessions.
The "Le Sabre" is the car of the
future "only in the sense that some
of its design or mechanical features
may appear some day in standard
autos," according to Earl, who is GM
vice-president in charge of styling.
The "Le Sabre" is powered by
an experimental V-8 engine do
signed by Buick engineers. The
lightweight aluminum engine
weighs only 550 pounds, vet is
capable of developing 1305 horse
power.
The "Le Sabre's" twin tail fins are
functional as well as a style feature.
They house aircraft type 20-gallon
rubberized fuel cells—one for gaso
line, the other for alcohol. They
are similar to fuel tanks in aircraft
wings.
One of the most unusual features
of the "Le Sabre" is the electrically
operated convertible top. If the car
is parked with the top down, rain
falling on a sensitized spot between
the seats sets off the raising mecha

nism and also rolls up the windows.
The rear view mirror is entirely
different from the conventional
type. It is built into the cowl above
the instrument panel—below rather
than above the driver's eye-level.
When the top is up, the rear window
acts as a prism to focus the rear
view onto the mirror.


SENSATIONAL —The General Motors "Le Sabre" visits the alma mater oi its designer today.
The above photo shows the low, sleek sports car with Harley Earl, Stanford '18, at the wheel.
Earl is now vice-president of General Motors in charge of the styling staff, with headquarters in
Detroit.
