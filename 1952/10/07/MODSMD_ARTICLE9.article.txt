# Mt. View Police Seek Gunmen In Quiet Holdup
## 
### 
Mountain View police would re
lease no information last night on
their efforts to solve the $2,280 rob
bery of Chez Yvonne Restaurant,
which occurred Saturday night
without any of the patrons being
aware of it.
Two calm gunmen drank at the
bar for about half an hour, then one
followed owner Roger Frelier into
his office, pressed a gun in his back,
and said, "This is it." The second
robber guarded the entrance to the
office.
While Frelier reportedly pleaded
not to be shot, the men scooped the
cash from the safe and piled it into
an adding machine cover, used as a
makeshift bag.
After the thugs left, Frelier called
police and told customers of the
holdup.
Mountain View police have issued
an all points bulletin for the men.
