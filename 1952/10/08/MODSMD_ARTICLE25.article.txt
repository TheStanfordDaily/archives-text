# EXCOM
## Crew, Liquor Topics Tonight 
### 
ASSU Excom will vote tonight on
the Student Athletic Committee's
recommendation that crewmen Jim
112 ifer, Dewey Hecht, and John Beggs
be given Block "S" awards.
Excom will also discuss i-ebuilding
the boathouse, the liquor resolution,
and the leadership conference.
The SAC—made tip of the student
members of the Stanford Athletic
Board—voted last night in favor of
giving Block "S" awards to the
three men who represented the
United States in the Olympics as a
"pair oared with coxswain." The
group used the "Exceptional Award
of the Block 'S'" clause of the
ASSU constitution in making their
decision. However, Excom approval
is required before the awards can
be made.
On the boathouse issue, the float
barrels under the boathouse deck
are already scheduled for replace
ment as well as the superstructure
of the dock. Additional funds are
now needed to replace the planking
and decking. The reconstruction
project was begun this summer un
der Stan Sheinbaum, summer quar
ter student manager.
The possibility of holding the
leadership conference in the fall in
stead of the spring will also be dis
cussed. The conferences are de
signed to help campus leaders in
conducting their groups.
Further discussion on the liquor
resolution is also on tonight's sched
ule.
Hie agenda is as follows:
