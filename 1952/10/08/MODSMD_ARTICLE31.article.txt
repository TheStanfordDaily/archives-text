UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Oct. 7
(UP) â€”The United States welcomed
today a Mexican plan for the settle
ment of the long-drawn-out contro
versy over prisoners of war in Ko
rea by granting asylum in UN coun
tries to those unwilling to be repa
triated.
The U.S. acceptance does not
mean an early solution of the prob
lem because the Communists are
known to oppose the plan.
Ambassador Warren R. Austin,
chief U.S. delegate, said in a letter
to UN Secretary - General Trygve
Lie that the Mexican suggestion
"could well" provide the answer to
the dispute thai deadlocked tha
Panmunjom truce parleys.
The proposal was made some
weeks ago by Mexico's President
Miguel Aleman, and Austin wrota
that "the U.S. government has wel
comed the Mexican proposal."
