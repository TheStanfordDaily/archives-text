# BULL SESSION

### BOB STETSON 
After we freshman men have faced the challenge
of (5,000 years of Western Civilization, half that many
themes in English A, and twice that many blisters
ia KOTC, we must ask ourselves if we are being
really good roommates. The importance of being a
food roommate cannot be overemphasized. Are you
a good roommate?
I'ules for being a good roommate are few and
simple, but, unfortunately, so are good roommates.
Lso if you want to be a good roommate, and don't
v/o all, spend two minutes right now and memorize
these easy basic items.
I. DON'T BE ANTISOCIAL
The roommate has a past. He must have a past,
or he wouldn't be at Stanford. Ask him about it.
Pick a time when he is studying his Econ and would
like a moment's respite. Make him give you all the
details. Know your roommate.
S». REMEMBER YOUR CULTURAL RESPONSI
BILITY
If your roommate doesn't like music, YOU can
broaden his horizons. Get out the gramophone and
half a dozen Rudy Vallee cylinders. Turn up the
volume. Broaden everyone in the dormitory. The
roommate has potential: develop it.
DON'T BE A NAMBY-PAMBY
Don't bother the roommate continually by asking
hint if he minds your doing this, that, or something
else. Show your self-reliance. Assert it. If he
doesn't wake up the first time you slam the door at
3 ji.in., go back and slam it again. No man likes a
spineless roommate.

4. MAKE YOUR ROOM A LITTLE IIOME
Hang up those pictures, posters, and mottoes on
the walls. Keep the radio playing. Bring in the
friends to see the layout and shoot the bull. Don't
let your roommate be left out of these things—he
might get in a rut. Dig out the ukc and have a sing.
These little touches x'emind one of home.
5. BE HELPFUL
If the roommate has troubles, help him with them.
Tell him what is wrong with his study habits. Re
mind him to clean off his desk and make his bed,
should he forget. But never clean off your own
desk or make your bed, because it might make the
roommate feel self-conscious. Remember: You want
your roommate to feel at honvj. Maybe he lias a
sloppy kid brother.
G. ABOVE ALL: DO UNTO YOUR ROOMMATE
AS YOU WOULD HAVE HIM DO UNTO YOU
This means that if you want your roommate to
lend you money, you should ask him for it. Don't
make him take the initiative.

These are the basic rules. My friend Farley Gimp
used to call them the Basic Six. He had six room
mates in one year. They passed him around on a
monthly basis, and of course there was always a
waiting list. Good roommates are so rare. He
couldn't make it back to school the spring quarter.
Don't belittle the art. Only through being good
roommates can we hope to establish bonds of friend
ship that will lead to World Peace.
