Stanford has been chosen as
Dr.e of the ten American univer
ses to house the International
Student Collection of the best of
fapanese student art. The collec
tion will be located in the Art
'Jallery until Friday, when it
will be transported to the Uni
versity of Denver.
The 41 paintings which are being
displayed in the Art Gallery com
prise the first complete exhibit of
art work by Japanese students to be
sent to the United States.
The International Student Asso
ciation of Japan is a non-parti
san student organization, founded
in 1934 to encourage cultural ex
changes with other countries
through student activities and to
promote mutual understanding
between nations.

Students at Tokyo's Kyoto City
College have sent to our country
three categories of paintings, each
in the best traditions of the Fine
Arts School of that college.
One group represents conven
tional Japanese art; the coloring
materials used in this group are
those that have been traditional in
the nation for centuries. Another
category consists of oils, and the
third reflects the growth and
progress of drawing and design in
Japan.
The paintings collected in the ex
hibit, according to Kyoto Professor
of Art History R. Sawa, '"are not ac
complished works of art. But we
hope the American people will ap
preciate them as sincere confessions
of the souls of our students who
have sought their thorny paths to
art under heavy burdens of their
strenuous lives in the confusion of

the post-war Japanese society."
Alan Valentine, president of the
Committee for Free A>ia, received
the paintings when they arrived
in San Francisco and started them
on a year-long tour of U.S. col
leges and universities where they
will he on display to students and
pu I) lie.
Valentine termed the exhibit "a
symbol of the interest of students
of Japan in developing friendship
and understanding with students of
other nations."
The itinerary of the exhibit began
aL San Francisco State College. Af
ter its stay at Stanford, it will be
transported to the University of
Denver, and then to Ohio Univer
sity, Cornell University, Wayne
University, University of Minnesota,
Brigham Young University, Uni
versity of Washington, and Mills
College.
