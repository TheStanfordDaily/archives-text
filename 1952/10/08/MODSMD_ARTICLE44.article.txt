# PRO AND CAHN

### 
Defense, defense and more defense seems to be the theme of Stanford
football this year. And Stanford has never been a defense minded aggre
gation. Of course the Cards have worked on defense, no question about
that, but concentration has always been in scoring, and usually scoring
through the air, the quick, painless, exciting way.
This year the worm appears turned. Indian touchdowns have been
comparatively few and most credit for Stanford's three wins goes to the
defensive unit which has stopped opponents cold.
Let it be said that Stanford's ground game is stronger this year than
in many recent autumns and this accounts immeasurably for the success
enjoyed by the still quick and apparently sure method of scoring via the
aerial route; Garrett's passing has led to five touchdowns and has led
directly to another of Stanford's 8 scores.
But what we want to talk about is the defensive unit. In fact we want
to shout about it. No end of credit is due Dutch Fehring, the Cards' de
fensive line coach. Forty year old Dutch who has been with Stanford since
1949 after winning 9 letters in assorted snorts at Purdue has formed a
defensive unit equally good, if not better than last years.
And he has done it after losing through graduation such stalwarts as
Jack Rye, Jesse Cone, Leon King, Hart Cook, Owen Powell, Bob Griffen,
and early this year Marv Tennefoss, who was forced to drop football when
a wrist wouldn't respond to treatment.
George Lynn has done a marvelous job handling his defensive backs.
Together Lynn and Fehring have come up with a rough, tough defensive
unit which is hesitant about allowing any ball carrier to poke his nose over
the line of scrimmage.
The defensive unit has held Stanford's first three opponents to a col
lective .'177 yards on the ground. Compare this with the 522 yards air
minded Stanford has picked up and it is easy to see that Stanford's de
fense is very tight.
Chuck Taylor has singled out sophomore linebackers Win Wedge and
Matt Armitage as being unexpected surprises and doing great jobs. Chuck
Essegian, Ted Tanner, Al Kirkland, John Broderick, Ron Eadie, Bill Storum.
Bob Hoegh, John Stanton, Ron Bush, and Roy Kiickeberg are very hard
to push around.
And what we like most about this whole business is that the boys who
are playing the good ball are men who were virtually unknowns last year.
Stanton, Krickeberg, Armitage, and Wedge are non-lettermen; Bush is a
transfer student.
This factor alone proves that the Coaching staff is working all the while
with men in the lower ranks, men who next season, or if injuries necessi
tate it, will be ready to fill in. This is an excellent policy. It gives one a
feeling of confidence to know that if a star is sidelined there is another one
up and coming, one who now is only an unknown name and number.
Don't get us wrong. Stanford can't keep reaching and coming up with
adequate replacements. There are just not that many ball players around.
But the replacements that have already been made this season are a credit
to the entire coaching staff and policy.
But getting back to the defense, we like the Cards' stubbornness against
an opponent's passing game. The line has been rushing the passer hard
and the defensive backs have been ball hawks in picking off and knocking
flown aerials. In the Michigan game alone, four Stanford interceptions
staved off scoring threats.
Michigan did complete a lot of passes, something like 18 for 30, but
these were only for .162 yards, or an average of nine yards per completion
including the run after catch.
Stanford, in comparing figures passed for 81 yards on six completions
for 13 plus yards per completion. The Card defensive backs have allowed
the short five or six yarders, but not the long ones. Until this system proves
faulty we will stick with it. This is the best defense against a single wing
club, such as Michigan where pass plays as a rule develop from running
formations and a back rushing up quickly to stop a run, may suddenly
find an eligible pass receiver deep in his defensive territory.
Speaking of single wing clubs the Indians meet another one this week
in Oregon State. To date the Indians have stopped the single wing of
Washington State and Michigan. The invading Beavers won't bring any
thing so radical that the Indians shouldn't be able to cope with it, de
fensively speaking.
