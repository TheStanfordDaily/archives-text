# It's N.Y., 4-2

### MIKE HUDSON 
Lefty Bob Kuzava wrote a new
chapter to an old story yester
day, as his clutch pitching
brought the New York Yankees
their fifteenth World Champion
ship. The Yanks defeated the
Dodgers 4 to 2 in a hectic finale
-o a hectic series.
Each team threw their three aces
into the fray, but it was Kuzava, a
second-liner, who put out the fire in
the seventh and held the Dodger
power in check.
The Yanks opened the scoring in

| the fourth when pint-sized Phil
> Itizzuto doubled and ancient
j Johnny Mize, one of three Series
bat stars, singled to his left Held
to bring Itizzuto home.
In the fifth. Yankee starter Eddie
Lopat was gently sent shower-bound
with a scratch single and two per
fectly placed bunts by Jack Kobin
son and Roy Campanella. Lopat who
has won 131 games as a big-leaguer,
gave way to a 156-game winner, Allie
Reynolds, as manager Casey Stengel
pulled out all the stops. Reynolds
managed to get the Bombers off the
hook with only one Dodger run.
In the fifth, the teams again traded
runs. Gene Woodling bombed out
the ninth Yankee homer of the
Series, but the Dodgers came back
as Billy Cox doubled and Peewee
Reese single him home.
But the Yankee power asserted
itself again as Mickey Mantle, who
off his Series performance appears
destined to become one of base
ball's all-time greats, whacked a
long homer to right.
In the seventh, McDougald singled,
and Mantle again brought home a
crucial run with a line shot to left.
Case Stengel jerked the tiring Rey
nolds in the seventh and brought in
113 - game winner Vic Raschi, the
third member of his triumverate of
pork-chop pitchers. Raschi was un
able to locate home-plate. Carl Fur
illo and Peewee Reese walked and a
Billy Cox single loaded the bases
and Raschi was replaced by Kuzava.
Kuzava first faced Duke Snider,
who ripped out four homers for the
Dodgers. Kuzava was unimpressed,
however, and got Snider to pop up
harmlessly. Next the young left
hander faced one of the great key
stone men of all time, Jack Robin
son. Robinson hit up a wind-blown
pop-up which Billy Martin just
managed to coral after a chase
across the infield.
That ended the scoring as Kuzava
and Dodger Carl Erskine, the third
Dodger pitcher mowed down all
comers.
It's hard to see how the Yankees
are always able to win the crucial
games. Perhaps one baseball observ
er is right when he observed. "They
all have an inferiority complex.
They feel that they can never quite
live up to the Yankee tradition, so
they never stop trying."


HANDY ANDY — Seldom has a
team looked as good in defeat as
the Dodgers did in this Series.
Here Andy Pafko robs Gene
Wuodling of a home run with a
leaping catch. Every Dodger out
fielder made a gveat catch, and
the Bums' great play throughout
the Series showed that the Bums
had finally reached the heights
predicted for them three years
ago.—NEA Telcphoto
