BROOKLYN, Oct. 7 (UP)—They j
weren't victory-bored old New York
Yankees who won the World Series
today. They were a whopping, wild- |
eyed bunch of kids who hit an un- j
expected jackpot at the end of a '
nearly invisible rainbow.
Even the Yankees—A word syn- J
onymous with perfection on the dia
mond—were choked up and scream- ;
ingly inarticulate after their seventh !
game victory in the classic.
"By God that's a great team we '
beat," hoarsely shouted grinning [
manager Casey Stengel as the team
roared into the dressing room in a
gleeful, mauling mob.
"Those Dodgers played like hell, j
I'll tell you. and we had to give 'em i
everything we had to win by a i
battered nose."
About him surged a band of wild
eyed, screaming Yankees — a sight!
you'll rarely see. But today these
guys knew they had been in a tough j
series and never had it wrapped up j
until the final out.
