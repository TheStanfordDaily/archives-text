BROOKLYN, Oct. 7 (UP)-There
was no consoling the dejected
Dodgers today alter they'd lost the
World Series again to the fabulous
Yankees, but down to the last man
they felt they'd done the best they
could.
Hardest hit of them all was Jackie
i Robinson, who sat for a long, long
time in full uniform and cap, mutter
ing through clenched teeth.
Finally it came out loud enough
j to be heard:
'"They didn't miss Joe Dimaggio,
! I'll tell you that. That kid, Mickey
; Mantle, made the difference. He was
great."
Manager Chuck Dressen managed
1 a smile after he'd gone over to con
j gratulate Casey Stengel of the Yan
kees for his fourth straight World
Series.
"We did the best we could all the
i way," he said grimly. "Just a lev/
! fly balls in right spots today would
have given us enough runsâ€”and the
series. We didn't pull a boner the
entire series and r.iy guys were
great."
