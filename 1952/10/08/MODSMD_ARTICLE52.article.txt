# THE 						DU PONT DIGEST
## Power Work for M.E.'s 
### 
Varied needs of 71 Du Pont plants pose
a host of original power problems
Heart of Du Font's manufacturing
program is the power plant. To make
some 1200 products and product lines
the Company operates 71 plants.
Most require steam and electric
generation, water supply and treat
ment, heat exchangers, piping sys
tems and related services. The de
signing of these power plants, their
crection and operation are all in the
handsofengineers, the great majority
being mechanical engineers.
But this is not the most interest
ing thing about power work here.
What challenges the highest skills of
the engineer at Du Pont is the wealth
of original problems constantly aris
ing. Power requirements vary enor
mously, not only from plant to plant
but from time to time.
Process operating pressures may
range from over 15,000 psi. to 2 mm
of mercury, electrical requirements

from as low as 7,000 to higher than
1 million KWH/day, and tempera
tures from —360° to over 3,500° F.
Here are examples of recent "off
the-beaten-path" power problems.
1. A plant using natural gas as its basic
fuel produces a waste oil of variable hy
drocarbon composition and a waste gas
withonly 110 Btu/cu. ft. Du Pont M.E.'s
designed burners, fans, boilers and com
bustion controls to permit use of all
three fuels for generating steam.
1. At another plant 20,000 gpm of cool
ing water were to bedrawn from a nearby
river. Since the water level fluctuated
40 feet between normal and flood stages,
it was necessary to evaluate several plans
for pump-house constructions against
cooling towers. The engineers installed
a unique pump house whose submerged
vertical pumps operate even when the
structure is entirely under water.
Aside from design and construc
tion, Du Pont mechanical engineers
concern themselves with such related
subjects as economic evaluations,
equipment selection, heat balances,
load calculations, waste heat boilers.
For example, where various process
temperatures from 300 to 600T'. were
required, Dowtherm was selected as the
supply medium at the rate of 35 million
Btu hr. The engineers installed a central
system for primary supply because it
calculated to be more economical than
separately located vaporizers.
On the operational side, M.E.'s
supervise the supply of power and
services. They establish performance
standards and analyze equipment for
results, cost and maintenance.

Whether viewed from the design
and construction side or the opera
tional side, the diversity of Du Font's
manufacture offers a wealth of op
portunities in power work for the me
chanical engineer.

a study of power-plant efficiency.
Varied needs of 71 Du Pont plants pose
a host of original power problems
Heart of Du Font's manufacturing
program is the power plant. To make
some 1200 products and product lines
the Company operates 71 plants.
Most require steam and electric
generation, water supply and treat
ment, heat exchangers, piping sys
tems and related services. The de
signing of these power plants, their
crection and operation are all in the
handsofengineers, the great majority
being mechanical engineers.
But this is not the most interest
ing thing about power work here.
What challenges the highest skills of
the engineer at Du Pont is the wealth
of original problems constantly aris
ing. Power requirements vary enor
mously, not only from plant to plant
but from time to time.
Process operating pressures may
range from over 15,000 psi. to 2 mm
of mercury, electrical requirements

from as low as 7,000 to higher than
1 million KWH/day, and tempera
tures from —360° to over 3,500° F.
Here are examples of recent "off
the-beaten-path" power problems.
1. A plant using natural gas as its basic
fuel produces a waste oil of variable hy
drocarbon composition and a waste gas
withonly 110 Btu/cu. ft. Du Pont M.E.'s
designed burners, fans, boilers and com
bustion controls to permit use of all
three fuels for generating steam.
1. At another plant 20,000 gpm of cool
ing water were to bedrawn from a nearby
river. Since the water level fluctuated
40 feet between normal and flood stages,
it was necessary to evaluate several plans
for pump-house constructions against
cooling towers. The engineers installed
a unique pump house whose submerged
vertical pumps operate even when the
structure is entirely under water.
Aside from design and construc
tion, Du Pont mechanical engineers
concern themselves with such related
subjects as economic evaluations,
equipment selection, heat balances,
load calculations, waste heat boilers.
For example, where various process
temperatures from 300 to 600T'. were
required, Dowtherm was selected as the
supply medium at the rate of 35 million
Btu hr. The engineers installed a central
system for primary supply because it
calculated to be more economical than
separately located vaporizers.
On the operational side, M.E.'s
supervise the supply of power and
services. They establish performance
standards and analyze equipment for
results, cost and maintenance.

Whether viewed from the design
and construction side or the opera
tional side, the diversity of Du Font's

tures from —360° to over 3,500° F.
Here are examples of recent "off
the-beaten-path" power problems.
1. A plant using natural gas as its basic
fuel produces a waste oil of variable hy
drocarbon composition and a waste gas
withonly 110 Btu/cu. ft. Du Pont M.E.'s
designed burners, fans, boilers and com
bustion controls to permit use of all
three fuels for generating steam.
1. At another plant 20,000 gpm of cool
ing water were to bedrawn from a nearby
river. Since the water level fluctuated
40 feet between normal and flood stages,
it was necessary to evaluate several plans
for pump-house constructions against
cooling towers. The engineers installed
a unique pump house whose submerged
vertical pumps operate even when the
structure is entirely under water.
Aside from design and construc
tion, Du Pont mechanical engineers
concern themselves with such related
subjects as economic evaluations,
equipment selection, heat balances,
load calculations, waste heat boilers.
For example, where various process
temperatures from 300 to 600T'. were
required, Dowtherm was selected as the
supply medium at the rate of 35 million
Btu hr. The engineers installed a central
system for primary supply because it
calculated to be more economical than
separately located vaporizers.
On the operational side, M.E.'s
supervise the supply of power and
services. They establish performance
standards and analyze equipment for
results, cost and maintenance.

Whether viewed from the design
and construction side or the opera
tional side, the diversity of Du Font's
manufacture offers a wealth of op
portunities in power work for the me
chanical engineer.
