# H.S.T. Has Friendly Manner, Says Daily Reporter After Press Talk
## Gives 'em Hell With a Grin 
### HADLEY ROFF Daily Political Editor 
The secret service agents,
their faces grim, their eyes dart
ingly alert, moved into the
crowded press car on the Tru- j
man Special and announced, •
'The President is coming."
The reporters hopped to their feet, |
as the President, wearing a broad i
smile, strode into the car.
"Good morning, Mr. President," j
the reporters chorused.
The President waved cheerily in j
return, found a comfortable chaii j
and began chatting informally wiih !
the men (and the boys, in my case) |
of the press.
The President's remarks, many of j
which would sizzle the headlines in
most of the nation's newspapers, ■
were strictly off the record.
And the secret service made sure 1
that the president's remarks were I
kept in strict confidence.
When I began jotting a few notes, [
a deep frown grooving his forehead.

me on the shoulder, told me I
shouldn't he taking notes, and took
my note book. Me returned it at
the conclusion of the press con
ference.
The chat lasted 45 minutes, and
the President discussed many topics,
from the weather to the most serious
of political matters.
He was alternately serious and
jocular as he talked with the report
ers.
It was apparent that he was
seriously disturbed by the quality of
Republican attacks. Whenever he
was asked about GOP campaign tac
tics, he would shake his head sadly,
a deep frown grooving his forehead.
When talking of the Korean war,
his voice, which usually vibrates
with high humor, would drop to
a low pitch.
But when on 3 of tlie more con
servative Republican leaders was '

mentioned — then Truman assumed
all the fire and excitement that has
made him a brilliant whistle-stop
campaigner.
During his hard-punching speech
in Oakland Saturday night, Truman
had referred to the "snollygosters"
who control the Republican party.
And during the chat in the press
car, the tweed suited representative
of the London Times, asked the Pres
ident to define "snollygoster."
"I dare sry." the Britisher said,
his accents broad, '"what is this
snollygoster?"
The President cockcd his head
back and laughed heartily.
He explained the word in lively,
cryptic terms. That is when the
secret service man relieved me of
my notes.
Truman is obviously a man with
a f.calpel-sharp sense of humor. Ho
sees humor in most every circum
stance, and he implied he thinks
politics, particularly this year, to be
a very humorous game.
He likes people. You could tell
that by the sincere flash of his smile
when he waved to the people who
gathered along the train's route.
And at a whistle-stop, when the
people began yelling, "give 'em

hell. Harry," he would wave back
to them, a smile exploding broadly
across his face.
One of the President's most strik
ing characteristics is his friendliness.
It's as warm as a next-door neigh
bor's.
That is the first thing you note, but
then, as you hear him discuss the
vital issues, you note his sharpness
of mind, his honesty, and, perhaps
above all, his sincerity.
The President understands poli
tics. He has a keen insight of
politics throughout the nation, and
can rattle off the names of local
officials with all the accuracy of a
veteran conductor calling way sta
tions.
The Fresident, who is short and

stocky, walks with a fast, step. He
breathes confidence, and when he
"gives 'em hell," he does so in no
uncertain terms.

my note book. Me returned it at
the conclusion of the press con
ference.
The chat lasted 45 minutes, and
the President discussed many topics,
from the weather to the most serious
of political matters.
He was alternately serious and
jocular as he talked with the report
ers.
It was apparent that he was
seriously disturbed by the quality of
Republican attacks. Whenever he
was asked about GOP campaign tac
tics, he would shake his head sadly,
a deep frown grooving his forehead.
When talking of the Korean war,
his voice, which usually vibrates
with high humor, would drop to
a low pitch.
But when on 3 of tlie more con
servative Republican leaders was '

mentioned — then Truman assumed
all the fire and excitement that has
made him a brilliant whistle-stop
campaigner.
During his hard-punching speech
in Oakland Saturday night, Truman
had referred to the "snollygosters"
who control the Republican party.
And during the chat in the press
car, the tweed suited representative
of the London Times, asked the Pres
ident to define "snollygoster."
"I dare sry." the Britisher said,
his accents broad, '"what is this
snollygoster?"
The President cockcd his head
back and laughed heartily.
He explained the word in lively,
cryptic terms. That is when the
secret service man relieved me of
my notes.
Truman is obviously a man with
a f.calpel-sharp sense of humor. Ho
sees humor in most every circum
stance, and he implied he thinks
politics, particularly this year, to be
a very humorous game.
He likes people. You could tell
that by the sincere flash of his smile
when he waved to the people who
gathered along the train's route.
And at a whistle-stop, when the
people began yelling, "give 'em

hell. Harry," he would wave back
to them, a smile exploding broadly
across his face.
One of the President's most strik
ing characteristics is his friendliness.
It's as warm as a next-door neigh
bor's.
That is the first thing you note, but
then, as you hear him discuss the
vital issues, you note his sharpness
of mind, his honesty, and, perhaps
above all, his sincerity.
The President understands poli
tics. He has a keen insight of
politics throughout the nation, and
can rattle off the names of local
officials with all the accuracy of a
veteran conductor calling way sta
tions.

stocky, walks with a fast, step. He
