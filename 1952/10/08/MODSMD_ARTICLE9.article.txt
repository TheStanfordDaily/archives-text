## Cambridge Is Series Topic 
### RUBY BERNSTEIN Daily Staff Editor 
While Cambridge students
may not wear the brilliantly
colored shirts that the Stanford
rough wears, there is not much
difference between the Cam
bridge undergraduate and the
Stanford student.
This is the opinion of Dr. Hugh H.
Shilling, head of the Electrical En
gineering department, who opened
the fall quarter Tuesday Evening
Series lectures last night in Memorial
Auditorium. Dr. Skilling, whose
topic was "Cambridge, England:
1952," was in England last year un
der a Fulbright grant.
While abroad he taught and
mingled with English students, and
his talk rcvcalod a keen under
standing of the academic life at
Cambridge and life as the English
man sees it.
"Cambridge was developed as a
seat of learning where scholars lived
a monastic existence," said the
speaker. The aim of the university
was the propagation of learning —
they wished to carry learning out of
the university and also to insure the
continuance of knowledge within.
However, Cambridge today, like
Stanford, is concerned with the prac
tical value of learning.
The differences between Stanford
and Cambridge arc only superficial,
said Dr. Skilling. He pointed out,
however, that the faculty of the
British institution puts more em
phasis on the development of the
student's character. Self-reliance
and independent study arc en
couraged and when the Cambridge
student graduates he has had a
chance to know if he can accept
responsibility.
The second part of the talk was de
voted to Britain and the British
people. Two points of view exist in
Britain today. One, the pessimistic
view asks if Britain can exist today
without change. The standard of
living is threatened by high prices
and shortages.
"Many things can be bought freely,
but where goods arc not controlled,
prices are shooting up. How long can
this situation exist is the main ques
tion," said Dr. Skilling.
On the other hand, the optimistic
view emphasizes a faith in British
character. The people feel thai
Britain is still a world leader.
"There'll always be an England."
Strength comes from the associa
tion with the United States and
with the alliance with the various
parts of the British commonwealth,
Dr. Skilling also briefly discussed
the British government. "If any
country can manage a government
half-socialist, half-free, the British
can do it," was his comment.
Dr. Skilling was accompanied to
England by his wife and daughter.

bridge undergraduate and the
Stanford student.
This is the opinion of Dr. Hugh H.
Shilling, head of the Electrical En
gineering department, who opened
the fall quarter Tuesday Evening
Series lectures last night in Memorial
Auditorium. Dr. Skilling, whose
topic was "Cambridge, England:
1952," was in England last year un
der a Fulbright grant.
While abroad he taught and
mingled with English students, and
his talk rcvcalod a keen under
standing of the academic life at
Cambridge and life as the English
man sees it.
"Cambridge was developed as a
seat of learning where scholars lived
a monastic existence," said the
speaker. The aim of the university
was the propagation of learning —
they wished to carry learning out of
the university and also to insure the
continuance of knowledge within.
However, Cambridge today, like
Stanford, is concerned with the prac
tical value of learning.
The differences between Stanford
and Cambridge arc only superficial,
said Dr. Skilling. He pointed out,
however, that the faculty of the
British institution puts more em
phasis on the development of the
student's character. Self-reliance
and independent study arc en
couraged and when the Cambridge
student graduates he has had a
chance to know if he can accept
responsibility.
The second part of the talk was de
voted to Britain and the British
people. Two points of view exist in
Britain today. One, the pessimistic
view asks if Britain can exist today
without change. The standard of
living is threatened by high prices
and shortages.
"Many things can be bought freely,
but where goods arc not controlled,
prices are shooting up. How long can
this situation exist is the main ques
tion," said Dr. Skilling.
On the other hand, the optimistic
view emphasizes a faith in British
character. The people feel thai
Britain is still a world leader.
"There'll always be an England."
Strength comes from the associa
tion with the United States and
with the alliance with the various
parts of the British commonwealth,
Dr. Skilling also briefly discussed
the British government. "If any
country can manage a government
half-socialist, half-free, the British
can do it," was his comment.
Dr. Skilling was accompanied to
England by his wife and daughter.
While Cambridge students
may not wear the brilliantly
colored shirts that the Stanford
rough wears, there is not much
difference between the Cam
bridge undergraduate and the
Stanford student.
