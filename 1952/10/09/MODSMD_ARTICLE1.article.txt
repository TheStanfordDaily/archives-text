## Korean Peak Won by UN 
### 
TOKYO, Thursday, Off. 0 (UP) —
Unite I Nations troops clawed their
way b;uk to the top of White Horse
Mounl iin last night as both sides
rushed reinforcements into the bat
tle for the strategic west - central
front peak.
The battle for White Horse, which
with Arrowhead Ridge guards the
Chorwon invasion route to Seoul,
icached new intensity while Korean
fighting slacked off elsewhere in the
wake of the Communists' unsuc
cessful 12,000-man offensive.
Only 30 minutes after the Chinese
stormed to the crest of White Horse
Mountain, an unidentified South
Korean regimental commander led
counter - attacking troops up the
blasted .south slope of the sprawling
mountain.
Two regiments—s,ooo Reds—held
the peak and the north side of
White Hor.se. Hundreds more were
pouring across a valley to the base
of the mountain through Allied ar
tillery fire and exploding 1,000-
pound dropped by UN fighter
bombers.
