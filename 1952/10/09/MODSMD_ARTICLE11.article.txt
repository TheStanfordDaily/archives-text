DEM DRY BONES- Assorted skeletons emerged from Stan
ford closets yesterday afternoon. They rode from Geology
Corner (pictured above being loaded) to the rear entrance of
the Biology Building in the company of Corporation Yard men.
Upon arrival, the skeletons were assisted up three flights of
stairs by Biology instructors and are now on display on the
top floor cf the Biological Sciences Building for the benefit of
Biology 1 students. The transfer of the University-owned skele
tons was made at the reguest of Dr. Graham P. DuShane.
