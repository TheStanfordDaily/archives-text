# Ike's Speech Cheered by 23,000
## Korean War Blamed On Truman Policies 
### HADLEY ROFF Daily Political Editor 
In California's largest political rally of the campaign General
Dwight D. Eisenhower, GOP standard-bearer slapped hard at the
administration's foreign policy and outlined a policy of his own
before a wildly enthusiastic audience of 23,000 in the Cow Palace
last night.
Speaking in abrupt, clipped terms Eisenhower laid tho major

blame for the current Korean War ♦
stalemate on the Truman administra
tion and pledged himself to finding
an "intelligent and honorable way"
for ending the conflict.
Provoking tremendous applause j
Eisenhower sharply decried the 1
decision to move into Korea, say
ing "The Communists hastened to
exnloit it. And we Americans arc ;
still paying dearly to redeem it.
Aside from the thousands jamming
every corner of the vast hall, another
20,000, police said, crowded the
outside.
Eisenhower, his famous smile
flashing brilliantly, received a bom
bastic two-minute ovation when
Governor Earl Warren introduced
him as "A leader who can lead this
nation to pcace."
"I do not believe," Eisenhower
declared firmly, "that Korea must
forever be a part of our American !
life. The South Korean ambassa
dor has recently said, 'Give us
guns; sp:. c your sons.'"
Such a policy would be a possible |
out from the harsh war which has
;o far cost us o"er 120,000 casualties,
the candidate declared.
He said, "Today the world lives in
a twilight, zone between peace and j
war—a zone we call the cold war." I
He then asked what courses of ac- 1
tion lie before us in shaping national :
policy.
"One is to appease; that has proven '
folly."
"A second course," he continued,
would be to adopt a stupidly ag
gressive attitude and so markedly in
crease the risk of global war."
"The third course is to prosecute
the cold war, in which we find our
selves, with vigor and wisdom."
One way out, he emphasized, is
to withdraw our troops, leaving the I
South Koreans to prosceutc the j
war. The suggestion, a startingly (
new one for a major candidate to
make, drew a smattering of ap
plause from the great crowd.
Then Eisenhower turned to count
ering charges leveled against him
last week-end by President Truman
who barnstormed through California.
Truman roasted Ike for alledgedly
misleading the administration by
telling it there was nothing to fear
from the Russians. The President
further asserted that it was Ike who
recommended the withdrawal of
troops from Korea in 1947.
He branded as "fantastic" the
charges made by "the-always-right
and-never-wrong" president, saying,
indignation ringing in his voice, that
Truman had taken his recommenda
tion out of context.
He admitted he did have an opti
mistic attitude toward the Russians,
but, he added, it was an optimism |
qualified with the recommendation j
that American armed forces be kept I
strong.
He said his remark, "There is
nothing to fear from the Russians,"
was made while testifying before
a congressional committee where j
lie urged the adoption of a "proper
(military) training program for
American boys."
Of the Joint Chiefs of Staff recom
mendation made in 1947 that troops |
be withdrawn from Korea. Eisen
hower said the recommendation was
made at the completion of "a secret
military appraisal of the strateeic
importance of Korea to our armies
in the event of a general war in the
future."
He charged that it was the civilian
agencies who decided to move Amer
ican defense perimeter from "islands
well off the continental shore" of
Asia (presumably Formosa and Ja
pan) up to the 38t.h parallel, 'an
imaginary line traced in blood."
"This decision," he said, "was of j
political nature and a mattci of high ;
national policy," adding . . . "It is
important for the people to decidc
whether they want to continue J
an administration that will make
charges to cover its own tragic mis
takes."
Having rapped the administra
tion policy toward Korea, Kison- j
bower then discussed his plans for
ending the conflict. His only con
crete suggestion about Korea is the
possibility of removing American
troops after the South Koreans had
been better armed.
He did, however, discuss a rather J
vague four-point program for world j
peace. "First," he said, "we must
adapt our foreign policy to a cold j
war strategy that is unified and co- |
herent.
"Second; in spirit and resolve, we
should see in this cold war a chance
to gain a victory without casualties, |
to win a contest that can quite
literally save pcace.

"Third; wc must realize that as
a nation everything wc say, every
thing v/e do, and everything we fail
to say or do, will have its impact on
other lands.
"Fourth; we mu::t choose a man
of exceptional qualifications to
j handle the national psychological el
i fort."
The national psychological strug
gle, he emphasized, is one of the
chief means for prosecuting the cold
war.
He stressed, "In a cold war >vc do
| not use an arsenal of arms and arma
ments, rather we use all means short
| of war to lead men to believe in the
j values that will preserve pcace and
! freedom."

Dwight D. Eisenhower, GOP standard-bearer slapped hard at the

stalemate on the Truman administra
tion and pledged himself to finding
an "intelligent and honorable way"
for ending the conflict.
Provoking tremendous applause j
Eisenhower sharply decried the 1
decision to move into Korea, say
ing "The Communists hastened to
exnloit it. And we Americans arc ;
still paying dearly to redeem it.
Aside from the thousands jamming
every corner of the vast hall, another
20,000, police said, crowded the
outside.
Eisenhower, his famous smile
flashing brilliantly, received a bom
bastic two-minute ovation when
Governor Earl Warren introduced
him as "A leader who can lead this
nation to pcace."
"I do not believe," Eisenhower
declared firmly, "that Korea must
forever be a part of our American !
life. The South Korean ambassa
dor has recently said, 'Give us
guns; sp:. c your sons.'"
Such a policy would be a possible |
out from the harsh war which has
;o far cost us o"er 120,000 casualties,
the candidate declared.
He said, "Today the world lives in
a twilight, zone between peace and j
war—a zone we call the cold war." I
He then asked what courses of ac- 1
tion lie before us in shaping national :
policy.
"One is to appease; that has proven '
folly."
"A second course," he continued,
would be to adopt a stupidly ag
gressive attitude and so markedly in
crease the risk of global war."
"The third course is to prosecute
the cold war, in which we find our
selves, with vigor and wisdom."
One way out, he emphasized, is
to withdraw our troops, leaving the I
South Koreans to prosceutc the j
war. The suggestion, a startingly (
new one for a major candidate to
make, drew a smattering of ap
plause from the great crowd.
Then Eisenhower turned to count
ering charges leveled against him
last week-end by President Truman
who barnstormed through California.
Truman roasted Ike for alledgedly
misleading the administration by
telling it there was nothing to fear
from the Russians. The President
further asserted that it was Ike who
recommended the withdrawal of
troops from Korea in 1947.
He branded as "fantastic" the
charges made by "the-always-right
and-never-wrong" president, saying,
indignation ringing in his voice, that
Truman had taken his recommenda
tion out of context.
He admitted he did have an opti
mistic attitude toward the Russians,
but, he added, it was an optimism |
qualified with the recommendation j
that American armed forces be kept I
strong.

him as "A leader who can lead this
nation to pcace."
"I do not believe," Eisenhower
declared firmly, "that Korea must
forever be a part of our American !
life. The South Korean ambassa
dor has recently said, 'Give us
guns; sp:. c your sons.'"
Such a policy would be a possible |
out from the harsh war which has
;o far cost us o"er 120,000 casualties,
the candidate declared.
He said, "Today the world lives in
a twilight, zone between peace and j
war—a zone we call the cold war." I
He then asked what courses of ac- 1
tion lie before us in shaping national :
policy.
"One is to appease; that has proven '
folly."
"A second course," he continued,
would be to adopt a stupidly ag
gressive attitude and so markedly in
crease the risk of global war."
"The third course is to prosecute
the cold war, in which we find our
selves, with vigor and wisdom."
One way out, he emphasized, is
to withdraw our troops, leaving the I
South Koreans to prosceutc the j
war. The suggestion, a startingly (
new one for a major candidate to
make, drew a smattering of ap
plause from the great crowd.
Then Eisenhower turned to count
ering charges leveled against him
last week-end by President Truman
who barnstormed through California.
Truman roasted Ike for alledgedly
misleading the administration by
telling it there was nothing to fear
from the Russians. The President
further asserted that it was Ike who
recommended the withdrawal of
troops from Korea in 1947.
He branded as "fantastic" the
charges made by "the-always-right
and-never-wrong" president, saying,
indignation ringing in his voice, that
Truman had taken his recommenda
tion out of context.
He admitted he did have an opti
mistic attitude toward the Russians,
but, he added, it was an optimism |
qualified with the recommendation j
that American armed forces be kept I
strong.
He said his remark, "There is
nothing to fear from the Russians,"
was made while testifying before
a congressional committee where j
lie urged the adoption of a "proper
(military) training program for
American boys."
Of the Joint Chiefs of Staff recom
mendation made in 1947 that troops |
be withdrawn from Korea. Eisen
hower said the recommendation was
made at the completion of "a secret
military appraisal of the strateeic
importance of Korea to our armies
in the event of a general war in the
future."
He charged that it was the civilian
agencies who decided to move Amer
ican defense perimeter from "islands
well off the continental shore" of
Asia (presumably Formosa and Ja
pan) up to the 38t.h parallel, 'an
imaginary line traced in blood."
"This decision," he said, "was of j
political nature and a mattci of high ;
national policy," adding . . . "It is
important for the people to decidc
whether they want to continue J
an administration that will make
charges to cover its own tragic mis
takes."
Having rapped the administra
tion policy toward Korea, Kison- j
bower then discussed his plans for
ending the conflict. His only con
crete suggestion about Korea is the
possibility of removing American
troops after the South Koreans had
been better armed.
He did, however, discuss a rather J
vague four-point program for world j
peace. "First," he said, "we must
adapt our foreign policy to a cold j
war strategy that is unified and co- |
herent.
"Second; in spirit and resolve, we
should see in this cold war a chance
to gain a victory without casualties, |
to win a contest that can quite

"Third; wc must realize that as

"Fourth; we mu::t choose a man
