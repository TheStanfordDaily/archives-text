# Why No Activities Talks?
## 
### 
Freshmen, you'll notice a slight alteration in
year orientation program. Tonight and tomor
row night you'll be able to study, there won't
be any activities talks.
But is this good? Why we . ins talks can
celed?
We have been able to find many sides to
the story:
rirst, the sponsors feel that they can ade
quately handle the activities talks in your
corridor meetings. They feel that this can
be accomplished by posting notices in The
Daily for organization tryouts and by ex
plaining to those of you the background of
the campus organizations.
The sponsors at Roble and Encina also feel
that you have been to too many meetings and
now in the third week of school you are ready
to hit the books. You might want to look around
a while for some activity, but you would like lo
hold off a bit before rushing into it. You want
to find your sea legs first.
Perhaps this is so, but we cannot pass over
Pre-Registration Committee, who met you at
the train, showed you around the campus, and
planned all your activities for the first week at
this University.
Committee chairman Bob James and his
staff had planned activities talks to be held
in the lounges of Boble, Branner, and Encina.
There was to be a general talk on the value

of atctiviiies and then representatives of each
group were to pass out information.
The conflicting viewpoints on the merit of
activities talks are not new. Last year the talks
were deemed unsuccessful by freshmen and
sponsors alike. No one could benefit from the
two-minute talk that was allotted to each club.
We must consider the activities themselves.
The larger groups and publications can reach
you through Daily notices. But there are a lot
of minor organizations, for instance those un
der Co-Rec, which you would not know about
were there no activities talks. Should these
groups be completely overlooked?
This year Public Relations Committee has
compiled an activities booklet which will de
scribe all the activities, professional socie
ties, and honor groups that you might vsish
lo join or be invited to join while at Stanford.
This book, financed through the ASSU, will
be published soon. Its merit we do not know;
that is for you to decide.
However, we do wonder if this book will
successfully replace the activities talks. Will
its content replace the more personal introduc
tion and enthusiasm that can be imbued by
meeting at one specific place with student
leaders of various groups? Pre-Registration
Committee would like to know how you, the
class of 'SS, feel. Do you want activity talks
or should they be forgotten this year? What
is your opinion?â€” Ruby Bernstein
