# BULL SESSION
## 
### SAM FRESHMAN 
The editor of The Stanford Daily, one Dorothy
Dodge and a woman, has asked whether in future
Cull Sessions I intend to alter Vic Palmieri's now
famous policy of making constructive remarks about
the weaker (?) sex found in not so abundant num
ber.? here on the Farm. Fcr those of you who were
not fortunate enough to be registered here during
Vic's reign, here is a little background. (I began
calling him Vic just recently Â£is actually wd never
met and it was only after he graduated that it be
came safe to do so.)
Good old Vic was the one who popularized the
phrase "Stanford Pig" and took great pains to see

that "it was always used with the
proper connotations. For all 1
Tn'ow he may have been the one
who started the often - repeated
"Nine out of ten girls in Califor
nia are beautiful and the tenth
one goes to Stanford."
Those who are in favor of pre
servinl the really useful and nos
talgia traditions may breathe easy
as there will be no change in Mr.
Palmieri's policy when I write

this, column. Perhaps the reason for this can best
be explained by relating an incident Jack Ledger
mentioned to me recently.

It seems two Stanford men had gone down to
Los Angeles (known to Californians as LA) for the
USC game last year and were having dinner at
what was then called Simmon's (a refined eating
establishment frequented by high school students)
when another car pulled up alongside of them.
In this car were two young ladies who, obviously,
had been looking forward to a perfectly boiing eve
ning. Out of a feeling of sympathy for these young
ladies the boys suggested that as they were new "to
the town the girls might show them around.
The reply of the girl at the wheel was to stick out
her chin and with her nose at a 90-degree angle to
the roof of the car remark indignantly, "Please, we
are Stanford women!"

There is a sadness in my heart today as I try to
grasp for the proper words to report the following.
Honesty compels me to take this action despite deep
personal 'friendships involved. I too was duped by
his first few speeches and taken in by his magnetic
personality.
Hut now I have been warned, and all who be
lieve in decency must be warned. Pogo is Wall
Street dominated! If you doubt this, ask your
self where the money came from for all those lapel
buttons that have been sprouting out with "I (Jo
Pogo" on them.
