# CAMPUS OPINION
## 'We Protest the Biased Manner...’ 
### 
To the Editor:
As members of the Stanford student body, whose
activities, interests, and opinions are represented to
the world at large by your publication, v/e the un
dersigned protest the biased manner in which you
have been reporting the events in the current na
tional political campaign.
To say that your interpretation of thee political
events is not at all indicative of the opinions of
the overwhelming majority of students here is an
understatement of the greatest magnitude.
We do not dispute the Daily staff's privilege of
convictions for the cause of Harry S. Truman (Adlai
Stevenson) and the Democrats, but we do challenge
their right to reflect, their personal views on all of
the student body through the student,' own news
paper.
Below are cited examples of the colored journal
ism typical of The Daily so far this quarter:
Wednesday's paper: .'{OV2 column indies of print
favorable to the Democrats compared to 6M» for
Ike; 21 column inches of pictures (excluding rally

picture) for Truman, none for Ike. In addition, in
today's paper appeared a headline entitled "Tru
man Hits San Francisco." This event occurred
four days ago, arid yet Ike's arrival today went
unnoticed, virtually. Monday's and Tuesday's
papers contained stories and pictures in approxi
mately the same ratio, overwhelmingly for Tru
man.
We could continue to cite such examples; how
ever, we trust that our point is well taken and that
The Daily will henceforth give at least a fair treat
ment to the news, if not one which reflects the views
of the students it is supposed to represent.
