# Pete Allen Specialty: Pennants, Poinsettias
## 
### WIN GRIFFITH 
The letter was addressed to "His Excellency, the Director of
Stanford University."
Written in Portuguese and postmarked in Brazil, it was passed
around by perplexed postal officials before finally being sent to
the director of the Stanford Office of Information. It enclosed a
request for a Stanford pennant. â™¦

Such peculiar queries are now the
responsibility of Peter C. Allen, who
replaced Fred Glover as head of the
office last May. Glover, who was
appointed assistant to the Univer
sity President, hud been answering
such requests by the dozen.
The main function of the office
is to inform the public about Uni
versity news. During the course
of its Wfv.'k last year, the office re
leased 12,720 copies of (J75 stories.
But requests such as the follow
ing continue to keep the staff of the
Information Office well occupied.
A card was once received from a
veteran who requested seeds or a
small plant of Poinsettia and a Pip
sissema plant. He received a letter
suggesting three nurseries which
could offer him more information
on the Pipsissema and telling him
that Poinsettias are garnered from
cuttings, not plants or Seeds.
A copy of "A Classification of
Three Fishes," by David Stair
Jordan, first president of Stan
ford. was requested by another

correspondent. The office staff
checked every library on campus
but could not find the pamphlet.
Many high school students ask for
old football programs, pictures, em
blems, decals, and pennants to be
used in decorating their rooms. The
office usually refers them to the
Bookstore. Young Stanford fans in
variably receive a cordial letter ex
plaining the scarcity of football
programs and enclosing a Stanford
decal.
In spite of the energy expended
in the fulfillment of such requests,
the Information Office was able to
expand and reorganize last year.
Now situated in a newly decorated
building off Memorial Court, the of
fice is known as the Office of Infor
mation and Publications, and co
ordinates the issuing of University
publications along with its public
relations tasks.
