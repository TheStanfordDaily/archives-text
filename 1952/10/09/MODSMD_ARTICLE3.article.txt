# Taft Hits Truman
## 
### 
SHENANDOAH, la.â€”Sen. Robert
A. Taft charged today that Presi
dent Truman's political technique is
"never hampered by facts" and con
: i.st.s of misrepresentations of his
opponents."
"You'd think the New Deal in
vented agriculture," Taft said in a
' rebuttal" speech to one made by
Ihe President three hours earlier at
the annual Shenandoah "Pancake
Day" festival.
Taft said Mr. Truman was a "past
master of the art of demagoguery."
"I have a kind of admiration for
the technique he uses," Taft said.
"It is the .same used by the CIO
against nr- in Ohio. It isn't neces
sarily effective if you meet it on the
nose."
Taft devoted much of his 45-min
ute speech to a defense of Republi
can agricultural policies and an
swered directly several points of
Mr. Truman's speech.
