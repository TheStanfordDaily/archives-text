fensive unitfi.
Halfback.' Bill Rogers and Char
[ lie Brazei i both did some fair coun
try lunnirg, getting away for long
! gains. I;« serve quarterback Jack
Gebbcit i as connecting nicely to
ends John Steinberg, Sam Morley,
ani Don ( arlson.
The terra i went through the rough
scrimmages, including the varsity
offense vsJ the varsity defense, with
out any ne .v major injuries. On the
J sick list .s :» far for Saturday's game
| are Dave lUldrich, safety man and
defensive iialfback; Skip Crist, of
fensive hali'i and defensive lineback
er; co-capti in A 1 Kirkland and John
Stanton, de V nsive tackles; and Ron
Eadie and I ill Storum, Stanford's
crackerjack defensive ends.
Eldrich se ;:ns definitely out for
: the Oregon 1 hate game, while Crist
I has a slim < hance of seeing some
action. Kirk! snd and Stanton still
havpn't come around yet, but will
possibly see wine action Saturday.
Also on the probable starting list
are Eadie an i Storum, but it ap
pears that Storum will definitely
play, aided by; a brace.
On the goo; 1 side of the news, no
new fumbles were reported, and the
j anti-tumble ( ampaign seems to be
'coming alonj with success. The
I coaches have been working all week
j to improve t; e ball handling of the
i backs.
