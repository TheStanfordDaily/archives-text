# ‘Little Sistine Chapel' Is Home For Newman Club
## 
### SUE WHEAT 
If you'were to wander into St.
Inn's Chapel at the Stanford
Newman Club in Palo Alto you
•night for a second think you
vere in Rome's Sistine Chapel
iround the year 1500.
For there, perched precariously
on a high scaffold, you would see an
irtist intently dabbing paint on the
chapel windows.
This modern Michelangelo is
Andre Girard, famous contempo
rary French painter who, at the
behest of Mrs. Clare Boothe Luce,
the donor of the chapel, has come
from Paris to decorate its interior.
Living at the Newman Club since
June, Girard expects to stay at least
two more months to finish his work.
His reaction to California: "Oooh, I
love it!"
The 51-ycar-old, hazel-eyed paint
er (whose thick black hair makes
him look much younger) is gracious
and affable. With quick ability he
will descend the scaffold, and, in
French-sprinkled English, spellbind
visitors with his views on art, mod
ernism, religion, or the training of
French commando troops.
Girard has completed the painting
of sccnes of the 14 Stations of the
Cross and is now decorating the
chapel's four 18 - foot windows.
The Stations, depicting sccnes of
Christ's sentence, crucifixion, and
burial arc done in oil on canvas
which has been laid over the plas
ter wall.
Each picture is on a separate 2 x 7'
panel enabling the figures to be al
most life size. As the pictures extend
toward the altar-end of the chapel
their colors become less brilliant.
The death scenes are depicted in
somber greys and blacks.
The ideas for the Station designs
are the artist's own. The windows,
however, which illustrate Christ's
teachings, were done with the help of
ideas from the Rev. John P. Tierney,
Newman Club Chaplain.
Girard is a follower of Georges
Roualt and Pierre Bonnard. Wary
of critics' classifications, he insists he
is not a modernist in the sense of
being a Surrealist, Cubist, Abstrac
tionist, etc.
''If you had asked Monet if he
were an Impressionist," Girard says,
"he would have been surprised even
to hear the term. "And,"he added
incidentally, "there is nothing new
about abstractionism."
The ten or twelve schools of
"modern" art which exist now, Gi
rard believes, will someday be
gathered together and character
ized by a quality of "freshness."
Girard, a specialist in the use of
color, sees in modern painting a
trend away from classical stiffness
where color was a product of
methodical reasoning. Modernists,
he says, use color with more bold
ness, "without forgetting that na
ture is a good teachcr."
As for the execution of a painting,
Girard believes that, like an actor
or a musician, the painter must com
mit himself to hours of repetitious

practice. '"He must know his draw
ing by heart," Girard says,"and do
it over and over in order to execute
it freely in the final product."
And the artist has indeed drawn
his pictures "ovqr and over" before
finally applying his brush to the
chapel walls and windows. In a back
room of the chapel he can show you
scores of drawings of the same pic
ture—studies done on paper, card
board, glass, plexiglass, and even
cellophane.
Girard studied in Paris at the
National School of Art (he entered
at the age of 14) and later at the
Eeole des Beaux-Arts. The exam
he had to pass to enter this latter
school, Girard recalls, "is harder
than any other work you must
achieve to earn titles afterward."
It included anatomy, perspective,
and the history of art—one ques
tion being to "describe accurately
any monument of art anywhere in
the world which the examiners
chose to name."
During the war Girard was part
of France's underground resistance
movement and for a year was staff
leader for the south of France. He
was arrested three times; twice he
did some fast talking and once had
to contrive a more strenuous escape.

While being held alone in a room
in a police post, he climbed over a
glass wall and through a transom at
the top of it. Then dropping down
into another room, he slowly and
noiselessly unscrewed and removed
the entire lock off the door to walk
right out from under the noses of the
Nazi guards.
In 1943 Girard was brought to
Washington where he worked as
liaison officer for the army.
Girard is married and has a family.
One of his daughters is France's
leading motion picture actress. Her
stage name is Daniele de Lorme.

at the Stanford Newman Club, here works out a preliminary
study in charcoal. Girard is considered to be the outstanding
exponent of the school of Georges Roualt. Newman Club is
located at 1247 Cowper Street in Palo Alto.
