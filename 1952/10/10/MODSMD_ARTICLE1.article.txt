### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 9 (UP)-
Dwight D. Eisenhower tonight chal
lenged President Truman's version
of the GOP program of federal aid
to education by presenting to
Southern Californians a broad so
cial program which included fed
eral aid to "states" lor school con
struction.
He al:»o suggested that his admin
istration, if he is elected, should
"explore" the possibility of federal
loans to local private health insur
ance systems in lieu of a Truman
backed plan for national federal
health insurance.
Without referring to the President
by name, Eisenhower took direct
issue with Mr. Truman's statement
at Jefferson City, Mo., yesterday,
that the Republicans wanted "no
federal aid of any kind to help
finance good schools ''
His recommendation on some
form of federal assistance to pri
vately financed health insurance
plans was coupled with a recom
mendation for extended social secu
rity coverage and his hope for "wip
ing out every inequality of oppor
tunity."
Eisenhower denounced the f Bran
nan farm plan as a "monstrosity"
and said lie opposed it "bitterly and
uncornpiomi' ingly." The Republi
can candidate stressed that natural
resources and the national farm
program should be under local con
trols.
