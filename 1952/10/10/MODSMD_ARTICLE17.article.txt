### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
"Japan needs sympathy and
understanding from our friends
in the West." That's the senti
ment of John Yashiro, one of Ja
pan's outstanding student lead
ers, who visited the Stanford
rampus yesterday.
The slim law student was hon
ored i.t a luncheon in the Union
dining room. His ho ts included
Dick Weismann, Steve Horn, Jim
Robertand other officers of the
ASSU and lIR. Dr. John D. Goheen,
head of the Philosophy Department,
was also present.
After the lunchccn, Yashiro and
many of the luncheon guests
moved to the Stanford Gallery to
admire tlr; paintings in the Japa
nese Student Art Exhibit. They
were : oincd there by President
Wallace Sterling, who greeted the
23-year-old Japanese.
"I'm happy to see our paintings
displayed here," responded John.
After the tour of the Gallery, Ya
shiro. Weismann, Horn, and other
members of Excom visited the lIR
shack.
One of the tilings that he no
ticed was the efficiency of the
American people. "They are al
ways rushing somewhere to get
something done," he marveled. lie
was also struck hy the number
of cavs mi the Stanford campus

"There arc no cars what* never on
the Kyoto University campus," he
declared.
Chiefly lie admired the "frank and
friendly" nature of the Americans.
"We Japanese," ho stated, "are more
polite hut not so frank."
"It seems to me," he continued
thoughtfully, "that the United
States citizen takes a pragmatic
idea of things. He changes his
mind and ideas to (it a definite
situation. Japanese are less will
ing to let go of a fixed idea, re
gardless of the circumstances."
For tiie last month, Yashiro has
been traveling across the United
States meeting campus leaders from
many universities and colleges.
Vice-president of the Internation
al Student Associaton of Japan, John
was in charge of the shipment of
Japanese art that is being exhibited
at the Stanford Gallery/for the last
day today.
When asked at the luncheon if
America could in any way help
Japan, Yashiro responded thought
fully, "No, not at first. Of course,
we need friendship, but we must
get on the ball before we ask foi
help from you. We must take the
initiative."
Summing up his feelings about
the American way of life, Yashiro
commented, "Americans like to be
in activities. This, I believe, is at
the root of your very successful
democracy.'
