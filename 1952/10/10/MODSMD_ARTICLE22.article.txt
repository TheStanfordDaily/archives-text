# Upset-Minded Beavers Challenge Card Record
## Indians Seek Fourth Straight; Taylor Optimistic Over Chances 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
QUESTION OF THE WEEK—How good is OSC?
The an swer lo this question should be of value to someone, as
it has posed d problem to Stanford coaches and national football
experts alike rill wec?k.
The answer will definitely be decided between the hours of 2

and 5 tomorrow afternoon, and de
cided here on the floor of Stanford
Stadium as the Oregon Staters lock
horns with Chuck Taylor's Indiani.
On the record, the "Eaqer Bea
vers" have been just fair, beating
Utah 14 to 7, and then nothing short
of GREAT against Michigan .State
two weeks later. The final score
was Michigan State 17, Oregon Stat°
14, but that was only half the :>tory.
Oregon State outscored the Spar
tans 14-3 in the second half, and the
Michigan men had to come through
with a last-second desperation held
goal to win. On paper, Oregon
shouldn't have been in the stadium
by the :econd half.
On top of that the Beavers
showed their worth by going
through the contest without an in
jury.
Taylor Unworried
Regardless of last week's per
formance Coach Chuck Taylor and
his staff don't seem worried. Wheth
er OSC's performance was a fluke

or just a great performance by a
! great team, the Card coach's 11 In
-1 rlians don't hcem to care.
As Taylor puts it, the Card;
| would rather beat a great club than
Ii poor one, and he plans to win
this one.
And they definitely won't be
playing a poor one. The Beavers are
healthy to the man and play a
rough, conservative game on the
I style of the SC Trojans. Likp thr
Tropans they run ofl both a T and
a single wing, and do both well. '
Jim With row in T
Big thing in their T-formation at
tack is Jim Withrow, the soph sen
sation. who seems quite capable <4
giving the ball to the light man at
the right time or filling the air with
footballs.
On defense the Beavers, who go
both ways, are extremely tough on
running but seem a fair prospect
for a cood passing attack.
On the Stanford side of the ledg
er, the Indians have been working
hard all week against Beavei play ;
and against fumbling. 'J'hey look
sharp for the game, even though
suffering from kev injuries.
Only C'ri.-t Out
The offensive team is in fine
shape, with only Skip Crist appear
ing to be definitely out. The va
cancy at left half seems adequate)/

by Bill Rogers.

QUESTION OF THE WEEK—How good is OSC?
The an swer lo this question should be of value to someone, as
it has posed d problem to Stanford coaches and national football
experts alike rill wec?k.
The answer will definitely be decided between the hours of 2

and 5 tomorrow afternoon, and de
cided here on the floor of Stanford
Stadium as the Oregon Staters lock
horns with Chuck Taylor's Indiani.
On the record, the "Eaqer Bea
vers" have been just fair, beating
Utah 14 to 7, and then nothing short
of GREAT against Michigan .State
two weeks later. The final score
was Michigan State 17, Oregon Stat°
14, but that was only half the :>tory.
Oregon State outscored the Spar
tans 14-3 in the second half, and the
Michigan men had to come through
with a last-second desperation held
goal to win. On paper, Oregon
shouldn't have been in the stadium
by the :econd half.
On top of that the Beavers
showed their worth by going
through the contest without an in
jury.
Taylor Unworried
Regardless of last week's per
formance Coach Chuck Taylor and
his staff don't seem worried. Wheth
er OSC's performance was a fluke

or just a great performance by a
! great team, the Card coach's 11 In
-1 rlians don't hcem to care.
As Taylor puts it, the Card;
| would rather beat a great club than
Ii poor one, and he plans to win
this one.
And they definitely won't be
playing a poor one. The Beavers are
healthy to the man and play a
rough, conservative game on the
I style of the SC Trojans. Likp thr
Tropans they run ofl both a T and
a single wing, and do both well. '
