# It's Time for Some Action
## 
### 
The time has come to clear up the Liquor
Resolution bottleneck. Although the quarter is
only in its second week, Excom's two meetings
have been delayed by circular arguing over
everything from the resolution's ?;ociological
results to the legal loopholes in its phrasing.
Wednesday night Excom unanimously re
affirmed the idea embodied in the Liquor Heso
lution. But the resolution was then sent to com
mittee for possible rewriting and evaluation.
We propose immediate and direct action on the
resolution—not only to speed up jts possible
preparation for the Legislature, but also to get
the resolution out of Excom's hair.
Two points of Excom debate were student
support of the resolution arid the propriety of
Excom members and students lobbying at the
,'jtate Legislature. Excorn was also concerned
with the wording of the resolution.
As the first step in answering these ques

tions, we recommend a referendum to deter
mine student opinion of the resolution.
We feel that the student body has every right
to support legislation which directly affects its
members. If the referendum shows strong sup
port for the resolution, we believe that the issue
should be carried to the legislature. Excom
representatives should not leave their posts to
do this, but a group of interested students could
do the job for their own education as well as
for the passage of the resolution.
Finally, we do not feel that Excom should
spend its time revamping the writing of the
Liquor Resolution since the Legislature will un
doubtedly change the wording, if not the pro
visions, anyway. As it now stands, the resolu
tion's meaning is clear.
If Stanford can be responsible for a new trend
in the thinking on this subject, the work will
have been worth it.- Mary Massey
