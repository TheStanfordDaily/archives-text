# Foreign Policy—Front and Center
## 
### 
Foreign policy is currently taking front and
center on the political stage. Candidates of
both parties are examining the past critically
and promising better things for the future.
In the arguments of both parties, there is a
strong internationalists emphasis. We are glad
to see this. It is a sign that the day; are over
when a candidate could win votes by crying,
"America First."
Both candidates have shown their under
standing of the need lor stion n estab
lishments. Both have shown .jy realize
we must fight the cold wai positively -by
stressing our own accomplishments.
However, though the two parties appear to
agree basically, is giving its own twist to
foreign policy issues.
Governor Stevenson is stressing the realistic
approach. He offers no easy out, but promises
the American people that he and his parly will
work for international progress.
It is encouraging to note that Stevenson is
willing to admit that his parly's record is not
perfect and it augurs well lor future improve
ment if he is elected in November lie also
has in his favor the many good things in the
Democratic Party record ol the last 20 yeais-

the Marshall Plan, the Truman Doctrine, and
active participation in the United Nations . . .
to name only a few.
Though he at times makes what seems to us
unrealistic promises for the future, General
Eisenhower has shown a generally wholesome
optimism in his international outlook. There is
no hint of defeatism in his statements.
The Republican candidate also has the ad
vantage of being able to point to Democratic
mistakes. His criticism of their record will gain
him ground except among those who ask,
"What proof have we that the Republicans
could have done better under the same circum
stances?"
Eisenhower has the disadvantage of the
isolationist tradition in his party. He is on the
spot to reconcile his own publicly announced
views with his support ol Taft and fenner
(who once called General Marshall "a living
lie").
If much faith can be placed in campaign
speeches, the international outlook should be
bright for the United States during the next four
years. It is up to the voters to decide which
party is more capable of living up to their
promises in foreign policy. — Dorothy Dodge
