# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
I WAS IN THE RUSSIAN ZONE
(Ed. note: Bull Sessioner Grcthe was h» Europe
<»vis srmmer covering the Olympic Games. The i\d
-1 owing incident occurred while he wa» in A u tria.)
There is at least one place in t.hp v/ci Id that is
unspoiled by that most horrible of a!l pr-• ie-s, the
American tourist. It's the Rus: i.:n zone of A istri.i.
The following may sound a little Class B movie
ish or like something out of '"True Confession* - .," but
so help me, every word is true. In the way of back
ground, an American is allowed in the Ru> i?n zone
of Vienna and he is allowed to drive through a 90-

mile stretch of Russian-occupied
Austria to get to Vienna, pro
vided he doesn't stop along the
way (not even for gas). How
ever, he is most strictly prohib
ited from going into any othe:
part of Russian - held Austria
and it's even dangerous to walk
through the Russian sector of Vi
enna at night.
When an American is caught
where he is not supposed to be,

cne of three things happens to him. He is either
immediately released, held for a day 01 two to
make .sure he is inconvenienced (this is most fre
quent), or he is never heard from again.
1 arrived in Vienna late at night and chanced
into the first hotel that hit my eve;;, it nccim'd
to me as rather odd that the hotel cleik should
be attired in a Russian army uniform. Upon
further scanning of the horizon, I noticed an over
sized portrait of Stalin on the wall. And several
Russian army officers in then knee hoot; and dr. -
food brown uniforms.
Without an awful lot of hesitation, I was out on
the street, looking for another hotel. The nert day
I was informed that the particular hotel was one lor
Red army officers and that usually th re were two
guards with sub-machineguns at the dooi to see that
no one got in. Only last year, an American corporal
was shot and killed for just pas ing by the door.

Several days later, an Austrian lady who was a
friend of my family's said, "Let's drive out to see
the Vienna Woods."
"Fine," I agreed.
v The Vienna Wood's are in the Russian zone of
Austria," she cautioned. "Americans are not al
lowed there."
"B-b-but . . ."
"Don't worry, there are no Russian soldiers in
the Vienna Woods."
Alter we had driven for a half-hour, I noticed
that the road was leading smack dab to a large
building with u massive star on it. "Must be a
Christmas tree decorations factory," I said, trying
to make a funny.
'That," my guide nervously informed me, "is the
Russian headquarters of all Austria. And you had
better get out of here as soon as possible. We got
on the wrong road."
The road I was on forked to the right and to
the leit. I swung to the right, put my foot on the
gas, and then noticed a harrier about 100 feet
ahea<>. I (lipped a U-turn and proceeded in the
opposite direction. 'I his road was also blocked.
All around me were many parked jeeps and many
Russian soldiers. With bulges in their holsters.
And 1 am a coward when there are Russians all
around. With bulges in their holsters.
Thu.'"., 1 didn't stick around for a comradely invi
tation to share some vodka with them, but rather
flipped another desperate U-turn and sped in the
direction from whence I came. I received many
surprised stares from Russian soldiers, hut no one
laid a hand on me to try to stop me or follow me.
In my anxiety to get out, 1 look another wrong
road uriJ found myself on a one-way street. Going
the wrong way. An Austrian policeman stopped me.
l! he had obeyed orders, he would have turned me
ovei to the Russians, since I was an American, but
he winked at me and let me go. Fortunately, the
Austrian police have no great love for the Russians.
Well, at least I found myself some territory un
j poiled by the American tourist. And aged ten years
in the process.
