## 'Departure from Truth' 
### 
Yesterday's Daily carried an offering by one Sam
Freshman designating me at. l' jai of the
phrase 'Stanford Pig'."
This is an obvious departih urn the truth in
light of the well-known fact that I succeeded in
popularizing nothing while serving my .sentence u.s
Hull Sessioner except possibly subscriptions lo (he
Palo Alto Times.

At the risk of seeming ungrateful, I would dis
claim Mr. Freshman's accolade further by adding
that the term in question never once appeared under
my byline.
Thanks loads anyway, Sam.
