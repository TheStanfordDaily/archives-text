WASHINGTONâ€”The administra
tion now sees no way out of the
Korean truce deadlock barring an
unexpected switch in Communist
strategy concerning prisoner repa
triation, informed sources said to
day.
The State and Defense Depart
ments arc studying all possible
ways of applying more military and
diplomatic pressure on the Reds to
crack the stalemate.
Secretary of State Dean Aeheson
said Wednesday that he has not
given up all hopes for an armistice.
But he was far from cheerful about
the prospects.
