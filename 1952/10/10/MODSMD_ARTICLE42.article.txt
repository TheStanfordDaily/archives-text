# From the Other Camp

### JIM FISHER OSC Barometer Sports Editor 
"Have the Oregon State Beavers been underrated?" That is the ques
tion that has been flying around the Corvailis campus of Oregon State
since the Orangemen held Michigan State's top-ratud Spartans to a.17-14
victory at Portland's Multnomah Stadium last Saturday.
Had it not been for a field goal with only two scconds left in the
/fame, Coach Kip Taylor's squad would have been heralded for the
upset of the year. As it is, the Beavers are reccivcing praise for the
gallant game they played against the Spartans.
The Orange, who usually depend on Sam Baker, All-American full
back candidate, lor the majority of the offensive punch, turned to passing
for the biggest share ol the offensive attack against the invaders.
While the MSC club kept its eyes on Baker, Jimmy Withrow, sophomore
fto in Van Nuys, started cocking his arm. Withrow, who broke Bob Water
field's high school passing record at Van Nuys, connected lor 149 yards
suits of Withrovv's passing.
'Ihe whole OSC team was "up" for the Spartan encounter. The series
between the two colleges has always been a lough one and the Beavers
have always heen tough to heal when playing the Spartans. To keep his
team in the same mental spirit is the problem that faces Kip Taylor
this weekend.
When the Beavers roll into Palo Alto late this week they are expected
to be at full strength although they might possibly miss the services of two
regular halfbacks, Jack Pinion and Jack Peterson. Both of these sopho
mores missed the MSC tiff because of injuries.
What worries the OSC coaching stall' 'most about the Red is the
ability of Bob Malhias. End Coach Butch Morse of the Beavers has
scouted the Indians in all three id' their games and is very impressed
with the natural athletic ability of (he decathlon champ. Our Coach
'laylor said, "Mat-bias is one of the best hacks we will probably see all
year."
Another main worry of the Orange coaches is the efficient passing
attack of the Indians. In three games the Red has completed 25 of 47
passes of a .532 percentage. The Beavers will no doubt spend much time on
pass defence in scrimmages this week.
A RUNDOWN ON SOME OF OSC'S TOP GRIDDEFS: Baker, of
course, will be one ball-toter that Coach Chuck Taylor will have to stop
if the Indians expect to win Saturday's game. Besides being an offensive
power, Baker also does the team's punting, averaging over 40 yards, and
spends a good part of the time playing safety.
Several lop tackles will provide some trouble for Stanford. Sopho
more John Wilte, who wins laurels in wrestling during off-season, holds
down one of the tackle spots, while Doug Hogiand', a big, rough, and
lough veteran, holds down the other. Boih of these bellies play on
offense and defense.
Four of Line Coach Len Younce's able guards, Cal Moore, Verne Fer
guson, Fred Burri, and Clarence Womack, were in the Spartans' hair last
v/eek and should cause trouble for the Indians this week. At ends the
Beavers have Jack Gotta and Bill Storey on offense, and captain Jim
Cordial on defense. All three are lettermen. Claret Taylor, up from the
junior varsity, looked impressive in the MSC contest.
In the backfield, besides Baker and Withrow, two transfer students
have shown well. Marvin Ussery and Wally Jackson played impressive
games so far this season, as have Bill West and Ken Brown. All four are
halfbacks.
Whatever the end result of the Stanford-OSC clash, one thing is cer
tain. The fans who plunk down the necessary change for admission
should go home well pleased after seeing (he two teams tangle. Al
though Stanford will be (he heavy favorites, the Beavers are always
capable of pulling an upset.
