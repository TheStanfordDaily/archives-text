Round two of the titanic mental
battle of the year is about to begin.
In one corner, favored slightly on
last week's outstanding (?) perform
ance. is the Stanford Daily Sports
Stall.
They're big and they're fast, led
by Phil Berman, hitting .800, with
Larry Cahn, Dick Maltzman and
Mike Hudson close behind at .700.
In the other corner, outweighing
the sportsmen by close to 100 lbs. per,
are the representatives of the Var
sity football team, Chuck Taylor, Jim
Vick and A! Kirkland. The muscle
men at present trail the typewriter
troopers by a scant .025. and are out
for revenge this week.
Perhaps the closest .game of the
afternoon, the Texas-Oklahoma tilt,
figures to place the winner promi
nantly in national standings. Ex
perts predict a victory for the team
possessing the strongest defensive
alignment.
In the east the Princeton-Penn
contest rates as another tight one.
Both clubs, who have recently de
emphasized on a large scale, held no
spring practice and had to start from
scratch this fall. So look for a wide
open affair between two sophomore
laden squads.
The only other close game takes
place down south when power
minded UCLA takes on the air
minded Owls from Houston, Rice
Institute.
