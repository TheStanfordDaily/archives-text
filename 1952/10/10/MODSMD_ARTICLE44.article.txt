## OSC to Try for Fifth Win in Series History 
### BEN HARRIS 
The Oregon State Beavers will be "up" when they face Chuck
Taylor's Indians in Stanford Stadium at 2 p.m. tomorrow. That's
the word from the experts who have watched the Orange and
Black in practice sessions earlier this week.
Word also has it that that last minute 17 to 14 loss to Michigan

State's powerhouse last weekend is
not riding well with the men from
Corvallis.
With only five regulars left from
last full, Coaeh Kip Taylor's eleven
gave the vaunted Spartans all they
could handle. They can be expected
to do at least as much tomorrow.
Going into this game, Stanford
holds a decided edge in the scries
begun in IJ/1!) with sixteen vic
tories, four losses, and two ties.
State's last win over the Cards
came in 1!)47 when a blocked punt
gave them a slim lit to 7 verdict.
Incidentally, Stanford faltered
nine straight times that fall. Last
year Stanford prevailed 35 to 14 in a
lackluster, but important game which
gave them the PCC Championship.
What can we expect from this
year's Beaver edition? Last Satur
day they employed the "T" forma
tion very effectively, but they also
have a Michigan-type single wing
to which they might well revert.
The men to watch will be "Slam
ming" Sam Baker, the crushing 210
pound fullback, and quarterback Jim
Withrow. Both men were outstand
ing in OSC's 14 to 7 win over Utah
three weeks ago, and again against
Michigan State last Saturday.

If Kip Taylor's men use the "T"
Saturday, Baker and Withrow will
be a pass threat as he attempts to

J carry about the same load that Bob j
! Mathias and Bob Ganett carry for I
Stanford.
In the single wing (above), watch
for Baker (F) to pass, kick, and be
OSC's "money" ground gainer. With- j
row (T) or (B), as in the "T," will
hit Wally Jackson, Claret Taylor, 01
Jack Gotta, the Beaver's top pass re
ceivers.
