# Two Offenses Tried Before Men's Council
## 
### 
Two Fundamental Standard
violation eases were tried before
Men's Council iast night.
Hie first case involved a senior
student who pleaded guilty to the
charge of using the phone of a Uni
versity office last spring for a long
distance call, and then misrepresent
ing himself to avoid payment for the
call. The student was caught aftei
making the call and gave a false
name at that time. Later, seeking
to erase his act, he said he identified
himself correctly and paid for the
phone call. Tom Blount, chairman
of the Fundamental Standard Com
mittee, said he believed the case
was "minor" but that it was defi
nitely a Standard violation in that
the student had an intent to deceive.
The student was sentenced to 21
hours of work at the Con Home to
he completed by the end of this
quarter.
The second case involved a junior
accused of signing fictitious names to
library cards in order to check out
Western Civ source readings to keep
for a long period of time last spring
quarter.
The student pleaded not guilty,
saying that be did not take Civ
last year, and denying that be had
ever checked any books out of the
Civ Ãœbc.
He did admit to being in the Civ
Libe with some friends last spring
while waiting for another friend
who was studying there. He said
that at that time he and his friends
filled out cards with fictitious names
and put them on the waiting list just
as a prank, but he denied ever tak
ing any books out under those
cards.
A library official, subpoenaed as
a witness to identify the student,
said he was "pretty sure" that the
student was the same boy who
turned in the cards with false
names, but was not "absolutely
positive."
The Council acquitted the stu
dent on the grounds that there was
insufficient evidence against him.
Summarizing the cases, Ross
Presley, chairman of Men's Coun
cil, stated, "Any misrepresenta
tion of any kind (such as signing
fictitious names) on the part of
the student is definitely a breach
of the Fundamental Standard."
Also sitting in with Blount as
adviser on the case was Bob Spil
lane, Fundamental Standard Com
mittee's representative on Men's
Council.
