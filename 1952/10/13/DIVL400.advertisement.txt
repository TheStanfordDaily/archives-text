Mary loves to shop
as what Red-Blooded
American Girl doesn't.
Each month when she
gets her allowance
she fairly paws the
ground in anticipation,
and despite her
budget, spends all
the first day.
She has the cash in
her purse, and she
won't have it later.
You know...logic.
Moral: Put your cash
in a Tenplan checking
account at Bank of
America. It will
probably last longer.
