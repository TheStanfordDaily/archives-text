(Editor's note: The cuircnt presidential
campaign has reachcd the point where the
Daily feels it should make its political posi
tion known. Finding itself divided, the Edi
torial Board has decided to present both sides
so that you, the student, can make up your
own mind.)
"For one reason or another, even a wisely
led political party, given long tenure of office,
finally fails to express any longer the will of
the people, and when it does ... if ceases to
be an effective instrument of party govern
ment."
—Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 1332
As election fever reaches its high pitch, wo
feel it's necessary to analyze the Republican
battle cry and see for ourselves whether it
truly is "Time for a Change."
Following the reasoning of the Democrat who
initiated the current 20 year reign of the party
in power, let us ask is there any indication that
the will of the people is not being expressed—
is there indication of dissatisfaction in the pop
ulation?
We need but cite one instance to say, em
phatically, yes. Wisconsin! There, a Senator,
far from the noblest in the land, was reaf
firmed by an overwhelming majority. And
why? Because he's a "fighter" who's at
tempting "single-handedly" to inform the
people of the inadequacy of the current ad
ministration. And the voters of Wisconsin
have gene over backwards to demonstrate
their dissatisfaction by renominating Joseph
McCarthy.
However, the feeling of the people alone is
not enough to warrant a change. Is there more
evidence to indicate that a full-scale change is
necessary? Yes.
The present administration has not yet to this
day made any concrete policy toward Asia. In
its anxiety for Europe, it has forgotten the Far
East, to say nothing of the Near East and South
America. And there is absolutely no indication
that if returned to office, the Democratic party
will change this attitude.
Secondly, the party in power, fat after 20
years of power, has grown lax in executing its
functions free of graft and corruption. The pres
ent administration, although saying it would
clean the mess, has not done so, even since the
appointment of a new attorney general. And
this is an ill which can only be cured by the
complete clean-out that comes with a changc
of party.
Thirdly, and probably most important,
after two decades of Democratic rule, the
United States government has grown to phe
nomenal proportions — centralization of
power has increased by leaps and bounds

and more and more sovereignty is being
usurped by the federal government. One
need cite but tidelands oil, flood control in
the Missouri Valley, and the abortive attempt
to seize the steel industry as examples of this
move.
Finally one can but briefly mention such
items as (along with the high wages the Demo
crats boast about) high prices, a seemingly im
possible national debt, and waste in federal ad
ministration, and the list can be of infinite
length.
All of the above we consider to be extremely
unhealthy and as we see it, the only alternative
to a continuation of the unhealthy situation is a
complete change in the administration.
"Aha!" the Democrats declare—"Don't be a
fool. Don't let them take it away. Change for
changes' sake? Why would the 'Snollygoster'
Republicans do better?"
We'll answer that one. We feel the ad
ministrative and executive ability of the Re
publican presidential candidate is unchal
lengeable. His record in World War II at
SHEAF, and with NATO is outstanding. And
he has indicated that he will make the
changes we feel are most necessary in the
government today.
He will form a concrete policy toward Asia
wdrking with a Secretary of State who, besides
having the ability to do the job, will also have
the confidence of the people—something the
present secretary lacks.
He will institute a clean-up of the Washing
ton mess and effect economy measures which
we also consider most necessary. He will halt
the increasing trend toward centralization in
government, and slow the headlong race to
socialism which the current administration is
aiming for. He will have our confidence —
something else the present administration
lacks.
And we are not so naive as to believe that
with a Republican victory, a depression will
follow immediately, or wages will drop, or
Europe will be cut off without a penny. There
is a great difference between the actions of a
party in opposition and a party faced with gov
erning—look at England. A party in power,
after years of opposition, must necessarily re
vise its stands for the solution of the realistic
problems at hand.
To sum up our views, we feel strongly that
both the attitudes of the voters and the poli
cies of the present administration indicate
it's time for a change. And we feel that our
dissatisfactions will be alleviated only by a
complete change in the party in power. For
this reason we pledge our support and our
vote to the Republican party and Dwight
David Eisenhower.—Walt Menninger
