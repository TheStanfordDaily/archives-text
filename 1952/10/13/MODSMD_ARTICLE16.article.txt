Charges of "me looism" have been loosely
hurled in the current political campaign. But
the fact remains that the Democrats and the
Republicans are running on essentially the
same platform.
Both parties are saying, "We won't go back
ward. We won't go very far forward. We'll
give you about what you have now—but we'll
do a better job of administering it."
For better or worse, this middle of the road
program appears to be what the American
people want. And both parties have reflected
this wish by offering two middle of the road
candidates.
Now it is up to the American voter to decide
—on the basis of records, capability of the lead
ers, and promises for the future—which party
will be more likely to live up to its platform.
The Democratic record leaves nothing to
fear. We know that the Democrats support
progressive social legislation; we have con
crete evidence in the great advances of the
last 20 years ... in Social Security, in conser
vation, in federal works ... to name only a few.
We know that the Democrats support an
internationalist foreign policy, for we have
seen the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan,
and active participation in the United Nations
under a Democratic Administration.
And what about leadership? To the millions
of people who felt that a new vitality was
needed in the top levels of United States gov
ernment, the nomination of Adlai Stevenson
for the presidency brought new hope.
Here was an intelligent, capable man with a
brilliant governmental record ... a man who
could lead the people of a great nation ... in
spiring them with something more than politi
cal banalities. To many people he is what
Eisenhower should have been.
Stevenson's record in Illinois shows him
to he an intelligent and practical humanitar
ian. Without increasing taxes and while ac
tually reducing the state budget, he succeed
ed in substantially lifting the level of society
in Illinois.
Here are a few of his contributions: lopping
1,300 political hangers-on off the state payroll,
increasing state aid to school districts, launch
ing a broad road-improvement program, over
hauling the state's welfare program to insure
that financially able persons pay for their own
care, pushing through 78 bills to streamline the
state government, reorganizing the State Com
merce Commission to make it bi-partisan.
And throughout his administration, Steven
son has attracted to him able men of both
parties to aid him in his work. He has shown
outstanding ability in reconciling men of di
verse opinions.

Internationally, Stevenson has behind him
years of intelligent study of international prob
lems combined with much practical experience
as a civilian in developing policy in foreign and
military affairs.
He was a special assistant to Navy Secretary
Frank Knox and acted as his "alter ego" in high
level policy meetings during World War 11. He
was a United States delegate to the United Na
tions San Francisco conference and in 1947 he
was called back into foreign affairs to serve as
an alternate delegate to the United Nations
General Assembly.
The American voter must ask himself those
questions:
Who can give us cleaner, more ctticionl
qovcrnmcnt—a man who already has a bril
liant domestic administrative record . . . or
a man who has spent many years remote from
domestic issues and whose main administra
tive experience has been military?
Who will serve us better as an international
leader: a man capable of brilliant thought and
expression whose study and experience have
included all areas of American foreign policy
. . . or a man whose commonplace manner of
self-expression has appalled many and whose
international experience has been centered in
the military leadership of tho European con
tinent?
Who will better be able to fulfill his cam
paign promises ... a man whose party has long
stood for progress and whose leaders he can
be proud to support... or a man who is saddled
with reactionary, isolationist supporters whose
viev/s differ so widely with those he professes?
Stevenson does not promise the American
people a Utopia . . . nor does he claim a perfect
record for his party. But he does promise a
realistic effort for improvement. Let him speak
for himself:
"Where we have erred, let there be no de
nial; where we have wronged the public trust,
let there be no excuses. Self-criticism is the
secret weapon of democracy, and candor and
contusion arc good for the soul."
And again:
"Let's talk sense to the American people.
Let's tell them the truth, that there are no gains
without pain, that this is the eve of great de
cisions, not easy decisions, like resistance
when you're attacked, but a long, patient, costly
struggle which alone can assure triumph over
the greatest enemies of man—war and poverty
and tyranny — and the assaults upon human
dignity which are the'most grievous conse
quences of each."
And it is in the leadership of such a man,
backed by such a party, that this country can
find its best hope for the future.
