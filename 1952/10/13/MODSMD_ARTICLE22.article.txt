# CAMPUS OPINION
## On the Frosh Activity Talks 
### 
To the Editor:
As an interested student and a former sponsor I
wish to express my opinion on the freshmen Activity
talks. Last year these talks were deemed unsuccessful
by both sponsors and freshmen. Why?
1. The allotted two minutes did not prove to be ton
short a time. In most eases oven the two minut?s
was not effectively used.
?. In many talks enthusiasm was misplaced result
ing in a joke session and the relevant information
that the freshmen were waiting for was omitted.
Why v/aste the time of the freshmen class and ex
pect them to attend a program which sophomores,
juniors, and seniors would walk away from? I
strongly favor giving the Public Relations Committee
Activity Booklets a trial. One program can not pos
sibly include every campus organization. The booklet
will treat uniformily both small and large organiza
tions. I do not feel that the personalized touch of the
activities talks is sufficient cause to justify fhe time
spent in planning and attending meetings of last year's
quality. It would seem more logical and efficient to
have the freshmen read the Activities Booklet, screen
their interests, and then talk to a member of the or
ganization or to their sponsor lor additional informa
tion than to expect the freshmen to listen and absorb
the information from all campus groups at once when
in reality they are only interested in one or two
organizations.
This is not an aimed criticism at the few good talks
that were given last year. It is rather a suggestion
that the already overcrowded freshmen schedule
should not be burdened with activity talks when you

have a better alternative, namely the Activity Book
let at hand.
