# 'Colored, Slanted'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
We realize that a by-lined story can express more
opinion than one that has no by—line; however, it is
our considered opinion that a story such as "Ike's
Speech Cheered by 23.000 ' is of news-interest to
enough people that il should not be written in colored
and slanted journalism. We think it should be written
as a plain, unadorned news story—unprejudiced, un
wanted, and unby-lined.
By-lined stories, except with rare exceptions, be
long on the editorial or sports pages. Mr. Roff's story,
although exceptionally rare, was not reserving of
20 inches on page one.
Mr. Roff's .sly "GOP standard-bearer slapped hard"
seems to compare Eisenhower's actions to those of a
child; and "a rather vague four-point program" seems
to indicate Ike's mental processes are lacking. These
remarks, whether justified or not, would be much
more appropriate on the editorial page than on the
page supposedly reserved for straight presentation of
news facts.
Here's hoping the next issue of the Daily shows
more editorial judgment and better newswriting than
this one did.
