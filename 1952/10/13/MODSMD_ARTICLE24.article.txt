# ON OTHER CAMPUSES
## Parking Problems Entangle San Jose 
### SUE WHEAT Exchange Editor, The Daily 
SAN JOSE STATE
Looks as if things are tough all over, at least when
it comes to finding a place to park one's car. San
Jose State students, who, for lack of space, park their
cars on city streets near campus, a few weeks ago
were faced with a rather unique problem when the
city decided to install parking meters.
San Jose students, not relH" ? ♦Iv thought of
skipping out of class every h plunk another
nickel in a meter, presented a m of 2 000 rig
natures to the city council, op, Jising installation of
the meters. Student body president Tom Evans was
also on hand to plead the students' case.
Last we heard, a joint college-city parking com
mittee had been formed to iron out the problem. In
stallation of the meters was still pending however,
and solution seemed to rest on the hope that the com
mittee could talk the State of California into develop
ing off-street parking facilities around the college.
Another blow to the Spartans has been the loss of
their Olympic boxing champ Chuck Adkins. Adkins,
because of a PCC sports rule has been declared
ineligible to compete for San Jose.
The rule reads that any athlete who boxed outside
of high school before the age of 18 cannot compete
in college pugilism. Adkins, at the age of 17, won the
National AAU title. What's more, San Jose cannot
appeal the rule because it is not a PCC member. Nor
can the school break the rule if it wishes to com
pete against conference members.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
Already the SC Trojans are mapping plans for

their invasion of Stanford on Nov. 8. A fabulous
Hooters' Special Train is to run from Los Angeles to
Paly and the SC administration has granted the stu
dents Friday off if the majority of them make the trip
by train.
Main reason for the train promotion is the safety
factor. One SC student was killed and another in
jured in a traffic accident while driving to the Cal
game at Berkeley last year.
SC leaders also feel that the train will "improve
school spirit." And how could it miss with the allure
of "a lounge car, a snack car, a dancing car, and two
dining cars" on the special train. One sorority has
already reserved a whole car for its members.

Speaking of push-button education, lower division
physics students at Cornell aren't very far from it.
The main lecture room in Rockefeller Hall has special
television installation by which experiments are tele
vised from the instructor's desk to viewing screens
visible from all corners of the room. What won't they
think ol next to replace Howdy Doody?
Cornell, incidentally, boasts tuition rates even
higher than Stanford's. As of .July 1952, the Cornell
student has been shelling out $'700 for the academic
year. A Stanford student pays $(iGO.

SAN JOSE STATE
Looks as if things are tough all over, at least when
it comes to finding a place to park one's car. San
Jose State students, who, for lack of space, park their
cars on city streets near campus, a few weeks ago
were faced with a rather unique problem when the
city decided to install parking meters.
San Jose students, not relH" ? ♦Iv thought of
skipping out of class every h plunk another
nickel in a meter, presented a m of 2 000 rig
natures to the city council, op, Jising installation of
the meters. Student body president Tom Evans was
also on hand to plead the students' case.
Last we heard, a joint college-city parking com
mittee had been formed to iron out the problem. In
stallation of the meters was still pending however,
and solution seemed to rest on the hope that the com
mittee could talk the State of California into develop
ing off-street parking facilities around the college.
Another blow to the Spartans has been the loss of
their Olympic boxing champ Chuck Adkins. Adkins,
because of a PCC sports rule has been declared
ineligible to compete for San Jose.
The rule reads that any athlete who boxed outside
of high school before the age of 18 cannot compete
in college pugilism. Adkins, at the age of 17, won the
National AAU title. What's more, San Jose cannot
appeal the rule because it is not a PCC member. Nor
can the school break the rule if it wishes to com
pete against conference members.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
Already the SC Trojans are mapping plans for

their invasion of Stanford on Nov. 8. A fabulous
Hooters' Special Train is to run from Los Angeles to
Paly and the SC administration has granted the stu
dents Friday off if the majority of them make the trip
by train.
Main reason for the train promotion is the safety
factor. One SC student was killed and another in
jured in a traffic accident while driving to the Cal
game at Berkeley last year.
SC leaders also feel that the train will "improve
school spirit." And how could it miss with the allure
of "a lounge car, a snack car, a dancing car, and two
dining cars" on the special train. One sorority has
already reserved a whole car for its members.

Speaking of push-button education, lower division
physics students at Cornell aren't very far from it.
The main lecture room in Rockefeller Hall has special
television installation by which experiments are tele
vised from the instructor's desk to viewing screens
visible from all corners of the room. What won't they
think ol next to replace Howdy Doody?
Cornell, incidentally, boasts tuition rates even
higher than Stanford's. As of .July 1952, the Cornell
student has been shelling out $'700 for the academic
year. A Stanford student pays $(iGO.
