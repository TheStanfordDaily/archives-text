thoy are depends on how bad OSC
was. Hold off until next week and
UCLA to make any rash decisions
about the team."
Beavers' heads, but there was little
reason to pass when the ground at
tack averaged 7'/2 yards per carry.
The individual backfield stats
loolceJ like something out of Pappy
On the Stanford ledger, the sig
nal calling of Bobby Garrett was
something to behold. It made the
older San Francisco scribes begin
whispering the now almost sacred
name of Frankie Albert.
That bootleg play for 19 yards
filled the pressbox with no small
amount of whispered wondering.
Running Little Indians
For Stanford, this was the coming
of age of the Card running attack.
The old "Leland Stanford Aerial
Cireu " was still hanging over the
pierce our stacked defense on the
one-yard line before they realized
that the answer was to pass or hit
the ends.
An examples of the Beavers' in
eplne:,s, they tried eight times to

| Waldorf's pony express. Bill Rog
ers, who will give Skip Crist n
"run" lor his old first-string right
half spot, had a mere 12.3 yards per
carry.
Close behind him were fullback
Bob Mathias with a !).9 average,
Hon Cook with 7.8, and Bob Gar
rett, the ground - minded quarter
back, with 5.7 yards per carry.
And the scouting report from the i
Michigan State-OSC affair warned
of the prowess of the Beaver run
ning defense and the weakness of
their pass defense. 'Tis all so
strange.
Full credit for the effectiveness of
the Cards' running backs goes not
entirely to their speed, but must be
shared with the elusive ball han
dling in the backfield and the
FIRST REAL DOWNEIELD
BLOCKING seen in this neck of the
woods for quite a spell.
OSC defensive halfbacks were
continually either taking after the
wrong man or sitting out the play.
On Rogers' 96-yard gallop, the
! longest from scrimmage in Stanford
I history, a pair of beautiful blocks
were laid on by Jim Vick and Bob
Mathias to got him started. He spun
away from one tackier, and was on
his way.
Garrett's Arm—lnsurance
Stanford's running game was
working so well that it could seldom

be stopped. But when it was, Gar
rett, at present pitching with a .560
mark, was Handy Andy with the
football.
He sent the ball down field three
times — once for 40 yards and a
touchdown, again for another touch
down when the line was stacked,
and a third time for 20 yards to Ma- I
thias to cancel a 15-yard penalty j
and give Stanford a first down. He 1
never missed.
And while plaudits are being
handed out, let us not forget the
defensive team. In the first half,
with Stanford leading 14-0, Oregon
nailed a first and ten on the Card
four-yard line. For cracks at the
line failed to net them one yard.
On the next play, Rogers reeled j
off his stunner to eliminate the
Beavers from the game.
Later, in the fourth quarter, a de- ,
fensive unit riddled with reserves ;
held OSC for four straight downs |
on the two-yard line. But a fourth j
down off sides gave them a fifth i
crack, which they made with a
short pass from Jim Withrow to end
Jack Gotta.
Offensively and defensively, Stan
ford put together one of their best |
games last Saturday. League rules !
guarantee that Stanford definitely j
won't be in Pasadena come Jan. 1, j
but thoy sure came up smelling like ■
a rose last Saturday.


ANOTHER TD—Here's Card fullback Bob Mathias just getting up steam as he romped 61 yards
for a touchdown against Oregon State Saturday. Throwing a key block for Big Bob is Len Mayr
hofer (61). The Beavers attempting to bring down Mathias are La Verne Ferguson (65) and John
Wilte (95). The OSC man (62) in the background is Frank Burri. —Quad photo by Dick Schwarz
