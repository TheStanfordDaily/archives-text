# 'KIP' HIGH ON CARDS
## Cards Better on Offense, Spartans on Defenseâ€”Taylor 
### PHIL BERMAN 
"Explosive" is the label given the Stanford football team by
Laverne "Kip" Taylor, Oregon State gridiron mentor.
In the gloomy locker room after Saturday's game, the Beaver
coach was high in his praise of this year's defending PCC champs.
"Stanford is explosive on offense, and guick to react on de-

fense," was Taylor's comment. 4
"They also have a good balance of
passing and running," Taylor added.
Asked to compare Stanford and
Michigan State (the Beavers lost to
the Spartans by but three points the
previous Saturday), Taylor was
rather reticent as to which is the
better ball club.
"They play different types of
games," he replied, "but I think that
maybe Michigan State is a bit bet
ter on the defense. Maybe Stanford
has the edge on offense.
"If the two teams should get to
gether, it would be quite a ball
game."
Taylor said it would be hard to
compare this year's Stanford eleven
and last year's championship crew
since he didn't "know enough about
the personnel."
He did think that Bob Mathias I
was better this year, while Bob
Garrett is at least as good a thrower
as Kerkorian. He also thought that
the Card halfbacks this season are
bigger and run harder.
Taylor was rather critical of his
team's quarterbacks, which accounts
for the many shifts in his offensive 1

backfield. He thought that J\m
Withrow, who played so well
against Michigan State, was "below
par" in the Stadium Saturday.
Asked about his next game, Tay
lor said: "Whom do we play next?
Just USC, that's all. I tell you this
is a rough league when you don't
have the horses. But we'll show up
for the Trojans."
Backfield Coach Ward Cuff, for
mer pro star with the New York
Giants, felt that Michigan State has
a superior squad to the Indians.
"Stanford is the second best team !
we've faced this year," Cuff said, j
Utah was the Beavers' only other
opponent so far this season.
Asked about Saturday's game,
Cuff answered that Stanford "just
had too much speed,, and the boys
were 'flat'."
"We left our game on the field
last week against Michigan State,"
he added.
OSC ran up a pretty high injury
list, although Taylor wasn't sure as
to who would be able to play in
their game against USC this Sat
urday.

"Stanford is the second best team !
we've faced this year," Cuff said, j
Utah was the Beavers' only other
opponent so far this season.
Asked about Saturday's game,
Cuff answered that Stanford "just
had too much speed,, and the boys
were 'flat'."
"We left our game on the field
last week against Michigan State,"
he added.
OSC ran up a pretty high injury
list, although Taylor wasn't sure as
to who would be able to play in
their game against USC this Sat
urday.
"Explosive" is the label given the Stanford football team by
Laverne "Kip" Taylor, Oregon State gridiron mentor.
In the gloomy locker room after Saturday's game, the Beaver
coach was high in his praise of this year's defending PCC champs.
"Stanford is explosive on offense, and guick to react on de-

fense," was Taylor's comment. 4
"They also have a good balance of
passing and running," Taylor added.
Asked to compare Stanford and
Michigan State (the Beavers lost to
the Spartans by but three points the
previous Saturday), Taylor was
rather reticent as to which is the
better ball club.
"They play different types of
games," he replied, "but I think that
maybe Michigan State is a bit bet
ter on the defense. Maybe Stanford
has the edge on offense.
"If the two teams should get to
gether, it would be quite a ball
game."
Taylor said it would be hard to
compare this year's Stanford eleven
and last year's championship crew
since he didn't "know enough about
the personnel."
He did think that Bob Mathias I
was better this year, while Bob
Garrett is at least as good a thrower
as Kerkorian. He also thought that
the Card halfbacks this season are
bigger and run harder.
Taylor was rather critical of his
team's quarterbacks, which accounts
for the many shifts in his offensive 1

backfield. He thought that J\m
Withrow, who played so well
against Michigan State, was "below
par" in the Stadium Saturday.
Asked about his next game, Tay
lor said: "Whom do we play next?
Just USC, that's all. I tell you this
is a rough league when you don't
have the horses. But we'll show up
for the Trojans."
Backfield Coach Ward Cuff, for
mer pro star with the New York
Giants, felt that Michigan State has
a superior squad to the Indians.
