Chuck Taylor and his lads again have those who profess to know some
hing about football scratching their heads and asking, "How £Ood are the
Indians?" *
The answer is a relatively simple one and yet such a glittering gener
ality that sound journalistic practise frowns upon such usaee, Neverthe
less we are calling Stanford an "awfully, awfully good ball club."
That's as far as we see fit to go. In the back of our head, we have visions
of this 1952 outfit being better than last year's squad, in fact better than
anything since the 11)40 Frankie Albert-led aggregation, and we might even
say as good as that team which went undefeated and took a Rose Bowl
iame from Nebraska. But for now we must settle with the lackluster state
ment, "Stanford is awfully, awfully good."
We still wonder whether Stanford has really been tested. We wondered
last year when we dubbed the Indians the How Boys and queried just how
good were the Indians, how did Chuck Taylor do it, and just how far could
the Injuns go. We were never sure v/eek to week whether the disaster
which seemed so imminent so often would descend. It didn't come until
Stanford had already wrapped up a Bowl bid. Then it struck twice.
Have (lards Been Tested?
Now we are playing the same game all over again. Going from week to
week being tested and each v/eek surviving. But have the Cards really been
tested? We frankly don't know. Each game at the time it was played was
supposed to be the TEST. Santa Clara was going to be tough. Washington
State was offensively loaded, of course Michigan is always tough, and OSC
was fresh from a strong showing against top-rated Michigan State. Each
one stepped up and was promptly trampled by the Indians who, according
to those who say they know of such things, were not supposed to have it.
This is exactly what happened last year. Each week was a test which just
failed to materialize. And it wasn't until the sixth win that there was some
agreement that the Cards were tough.
This Saturday Stanford takes another test when they meet UCLA in
the Coliseum. The Bruins were a pre-season choice to end right up there
in the first three. To date they have done nothing to cast disbelief. They
squeezed by Oregon and then have looked sharp in beating TCU, Wash
ington, and Rice.
It boils down to a battle of the undefeated. And who will prevail?
Indians Over UCLA
We can't he!;> but go along with the Indians. In our way of thinking the
performance of the varsity Saturday was the finest we have seen in ten
years of watching the Big Red. The only comparable game we can recall
is the 11)50 USF tilt when a USF squad boasting Ollie Matson, Ed Scudero,
and a good line invaded the Stadium even money, and a Marchie Schwartz
outfit put together an outstanding game to rout the Dons 55-7.
Chuck Taylor after Saturday's game went on record as saying, ''We put
things together out there today." And that the Taylormen did.
What we liked best of all was the ground game. The Indians smashed
for 360 yards on the ground. And there were long gainers. Mathias, Rogers,
Cook all went for the long one, and St. Genie returned an intercepted pass
all the way. All this is indicative of tremendous down-field blocking, some
thing which in the past has been lacking.
The Cards only had to take to the air on three occasions, for three com
pletions and two touchdowns. A running game does wonders for the effec
tiveness of a passing game, and the double-barreled passing, running of
lense which the Cards now seem to possess should be hard to silence.
Coupled with the fact that the Bruins despite winning have not shown
a great deal offensively and not much more defensively, and their two
stars, Paul Cameron and Ted Narleski, are hoth doubtful participants Sat
urday, and that the game is played in the Coliseum which always seems to
inspire the Indians to great heights, and that it is homecoming for Garrett,
Pyle, Essegian, Goldberg. Morley, Roberg, Storum, all out of the Los
Angeles area, and that Stanford has an "awfully, awfully good football
club," we look for them to take this TEST in great style,

urday, and that the game is played in the Coliseum which always seems to
inspire the Indians to great heights, and that it is homecoming for Garrett,
Pyle, Essegian, Goldberg. Morley, Roberg, Storum, all out of the Los
Angeles area, and that Stanford has an "awfully, awfully good football
club," we look for them to take this TEST in great style,
Chuck Taylor and his lads again have those who profess to know some
hing about football scratching their heads and asking, "How £Ood are the
Indians?" *
The answer is a relatively simple one and yet such a glittering gener
ality that sound journalistic practise frowns upon such usaee, Neverthe
less we are calling Stanford an "awfully, awfully good ball club."
That's as far as we see fit to go. In the back of our head, we have visions
of this 1952 outfit being better than last year's squad, in fact better than
anything since the 11)40 Frankie Albert-led aggregation, and we might even
say as good as that team which went undefeated and took a Rose Bowl
iame from Nebraska. But for now we must settle with the lackluster state
ment, "Stanford is awfully, awfully good."
We still wonder whether Stanford has really been tested. We wondered
last year when we dubbed the Indians the How Boys and queried just how
good were the Indians, how did Chuck Taylor do it, and just how far could
the Injuns go. We were never sure v/eek to week whether the disaster
which seemed so imminent so often would descend. It didn't come until
Stanford had already wrapped up a Bowl bid. Then it struck twice.
Have (lards Been Tested?
Now we are playing the same game all over again. Going from week to
week being tested and each v/eek surviving. But have the Cards really been
tested? We frankly don't know. Each game at the time it was played was
supposed to be the TEST. Santa Clara was going to be tough. Washington
State was offensively loaded, of course Michigan is always tough, and OSC
was fresh from a strong showing against top-rated Michigan State. Each
one stepped up and was promptly trampled by the Indians who, according
to those who say they know of such things, were not supposed to have it.
This is exactly what happened last year. Each week was a test which just
failed to materialize. And it wasn't until the sixth win that there was some
agreement that the Cards were tough.
This Saturday Stanford takes another test when they meet UCLA in
the Coliseum. The Bruins were a pre-season choice to end right up there
in the first three. To date they have done nothing to cast disbelief. They
squeezed by Oregon and then have looked sharp in beating TCU, Wash
ington, and Rice.
It boils down to a battle of the undefeated. And who will prevail?
Indians Over UCLA
We can't he!;> but go along with the Indians. In our way of thinking the
performance of the varsity Saturday was the finest we have seen in ten
years of watching the Big Red. The only comparable game we can recall
is the 11)50 USF tilt when a USF squad boasting Ollie Matson, Ed Scudero,
and a good line invaded the Stadium even money, and a Marchie Schwartz
outfit put together an outstanding game to rout the Dons 55-7.
Chuck Taylor after Saturday's game went on record as saying, ''We put
things together out there today." And that the Taylormen did.
What we liked best of all was the ground game. The Indians smashed
for 360 yards on the ground. And there were long gainers. Mathias, Rogers,
Cook all went for the long one, and St. Genie returned an intercepted pass
all the way. All this is indicative of tremendous down-field blocking, some
thing which in the past has been lacking.
The Cards only had to take to the air on three occasions, for three com
pletions and two touchdowns. A running game does wonders for the effec
tiveness of a passing game, and the double-barreled passing, running of
lense which the Cards now seem to possess should be hard to silence.
Coupled with the fact that the Bruins despite winning have not shown
a great deal offensively and not much more defensively, and their two
stars, Paul Cameron and Ted Narleski, are hoth doubtful participants Sat
urday, and that the game is played in the Coliseum which always seems to
inspire the Indians to great heights, and that it is homecoming for Garrett,
Pyle, Essegian, Goldberg. Morley, Roberg, Storum, all out of the Los
