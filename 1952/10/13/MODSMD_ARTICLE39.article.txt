# Cal Mermen Top Cards in Opener
## 
### 
California's Golden Bear took to
the water last Saturday morning
and dampened Stanford's league
water polo debut 4-3 at the Encina
gymnasium pool. A goal in the
final 30 seconds of play by Dick
Ehni broke a 3-all tie and gave Cal
| the victory.
The Blue and Gold outplayed the
Cards for three periods, registering
two goals on tallies by Ehni and a
40-foot toss by Don Smalian. As
the fourth quarter began, Cal goalie
Bob Kahl, who was batting down
everything that came his way, ap
peared to be well on.the road to p
shut-out.
But realization by the Indians
that the end was near brought out
a vicious offensive assault on their
part. Jim Gaugran, Stanford's most
prolific scorer, dented the twines
and a minute later Pete Cole
rammed one home to knot the score
j at 2-2.
Ehr\i, offensive star of the day,
broke the tie with a penalty shot,
but with a minute to go Gaugran
countered with a score. The stage
was thus set for Ehni, who once
more came through to the disap
pointment of the large crowd,
j It was the first defeat of the sea
son for the mermen, who are trying
jto protect their PCC crown. This
j weekend the squad travels to Los
I Angeles, where it meets USC on
I Friday and UCLA on Saturday.
