That's the question UCLA stu

tory. Kickoff for the gala festivities
comes Friday morning when the
Homecoming Queen will be crowned
at the foot of Jans Steps on the
campus.
Friday night Stanford rooters can
view the UCLA float parade as it
wends its way through Westwood
and ends up at Trotter Field on the
campus.
After the parade, fireworks dis

Bruin and Stanford bands will play
for the students. Stanford rooters
will sit in a special reserved section.
Following the rally will be a giant
dance at Kerckhoff Hall for both
UCLA and Stanford students.
