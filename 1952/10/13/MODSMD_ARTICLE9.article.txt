# Police Trace Encina Vandals
## 
### 
Thanks to excellent co-operation
from residents of Encina, campus
police have been able to trace to
San Francisco an automobile whose
youthful occupants vandalized the
.freshman dormitory early Saturday
morning.
The hoodlums entered Encina
shortly after midnight to tear sev
eral telephones from the wall and
spray the downstairs floor with the
contents of two fire extinguishers.
The officer on duty was attracted
by the commotion only to find
freshmen already attempting to snag
the vandals. The efforts at capture
were fruitless, however, as the
youths raced to a yellow conver
tible and sped away.
