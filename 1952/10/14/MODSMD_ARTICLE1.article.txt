# FULBRIGHT SCHOLARSHIPS
## Japanese Students Are Typical Beneficiaries 
### DON LEIGHTON 
Smart people, these Amos —Kohei, Tamio, and Kazuko.
Papa and Mama Aino, Tokyo, Japan, are the parents of five
children, the three youngest of whom have distinguished them
selves by winning Fulbright scholarships for advanced university
study in the United States.
Kohei, the youngest member of the family and the latest to re-

ceive tlip Fulbright aid, is now
studying \ electrical engineeiing at
Stanford.
He was graduated from Tokyo
University last March and was then
employed by the Tokyo-Shibaura
Electric Co. before enrolling here this
quarter.
Kohei was given a two years' leave
of absence by the company and will
return to work for them when he
completes his studies in the United
States.
The Fulbright grants arc for only
one year, hut Kohei hopes to stay
on the Farm an additional year if
he can obtain further assistance
from the University.
Kohei, in his room at the Village,
explained a slight delay in his edu
cation—during the more heated part
of World War Ii he, like most Japa
nese students, had to work in a fac
tory. He is 24 years old.
Tamio, one of his brothers, studied
international law at Colgate Univer
sity, N.Y., and Georgetown Univer
sity, Wash., D.C., last year and is
now an official in the Japanese for
eign office at Tokyo.
Kazuko, Kohei's youngest sister, is
currently studying English literature
at Bryn Mawr College, Pa., and will
return to Japan next spring.
The Fulbright scholarship pro
gram is sponsored by the United
States State Department and is
financed by the sale of surplus
materials confiscated from former
enemies. Twenty-three nations are
now participating in the program.
This year there are 300 Japanese
students studying in the United
States under Fulbright grants; four
of the students are at Stanford.
Beside Kohei, they are Shinichi
Shimoda, majoring in journalism,
Minuro Morita, engineering, and
Hajime Ohkura, business.
