TOKYO, Tuesday, Oct. 14 (UP)
—Allied troops backed by a tre
mendous artillery barrage, tanks
and lighter bombers slammed
the biggest U.N. attack in a year
against a Communist hill for
tress on the central front today.
The UN troops kicked off the as
sault al 0:04 a.m. (1:04 p.m. PST
Monday) against "Triangle Hil!"
north of Kumhwa. An hour later
they had clawed their way to the
} crest, only to he beaten back by
reinforced Chinese holding t,he peak.
Three hours after the assault, Al
: lied troops were clinging to tho
I slopes halfway up Triangle Hill.
The UN attack shifted th# focus
of the fighting along the 155-mile
j Korean battlefront from White
Horse Mountain, where five weak
attacks by the Chinese last night
I and early today were easily beat
en off. The Chinese threw "hu
j man torpedo" assaults at Whit«
last night but they were
j repulsed.
South Korean Ninth Division
j troops counter-attacked at 4 a.m.
| (11 a.m. PST Monday) in an attempt.
Ito wipe out Chinese remaining on
j three knobs on the northwestern
approaches of White Horse and
; clinch their "classic" victory in the
I week-long battle for the vital peak.
"Everybody seems to think this
about wraps it up," an officer
j said of the White Horse battle,
j "We think the ( hinese should br
convinced by thi;; time that
they've lost tiie fight."
The ROKs' aim was to drive the
last Chinese from White Horse, a
; mountain that dominates the
| Choi won invasion gateway to
I Seoul and for which some of the
bloodiest fighting of the Korean
wet has rag"d -dn'-e the Reds at
tacked in force last Monday n'ght.
Twelve times the Chinese, spend
j their manpower recklessly in
; mass attacks that cost them more
than 10,000 casualties, knocked the
ROKs off White Horse. And 12
limes the ROKs came back, the last
j on Sunday.
"It was a tremendous victory
over overwhelming odds and man
power," said Lt. Gen. James A. Van
Fleet, commander of the Eighth
Army. "It, was a classic."
