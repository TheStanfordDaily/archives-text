## Ike Slams 'Shoddy' Tidelands Deal; Stevenson Receives Support from UME Eisenhower 
### 
NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 13 (UP) â€”
Dwight D. Eisenhower told a wildly
cheering crowd of 15,000 persons
tonight that his Democratic oppo
nent, Gov. Adlai Stevenson, and
President Truman were attempting
to sell the coastal people of the
United States a "shoddy deal" on
tidelands oil.
The Republican Presidential can
didate, speaking in historic Beau
regard Square, was formally pre
sented to the people of Louisiana
by Gov. Robert F. Kennon, a Dem
ocrat, who rejected his national
party ticket to support Eisenhower
in backing state control of tidelands
oil.
The Republican Presidential can
didate made a "hate . . . fears . . .
rot and lies" accusation in a short
speech before 8,000 persons at the
Oklahoma City, Okla., airport, just
before taking off for New Orleans.
He hotly denounced the Demo
crats for trying to spread the word
that he wants to cut the pay of men
in the armed forces and do away
with Tinker Air Force Base at Ok
lahoma City.
Then he took up charges that the
GOP will do away with social se
curity and pensions if it wins.
"That kind of hate, fears, and lies
is not campaigning. That is just
spreading lies and poison," he said.
Eisenhower's speech on the tide
lands in New Orleans, in his fourth
invasion of the South, w;is the most
definite he has tmde. He flatly sup
ported "the traditional concept of
state ownership of these submerged
areas."
