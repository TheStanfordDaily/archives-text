CINCINNATI, Oct. 1.1 (UP)â€”The
United Minewoikers endorsed Dem
ocratic Presidential nominee Adlai
E. Stevenson today as UMW con
vention delegates awaited Wage
Stabilization Board action that could
bring a nation-wide coal strike.
Following the lead of their out
spoken leader, John L. Lewis, the
2,800 delegates roared their approval
of the resolution supporting Steven
son and his running mate, Sen. John
J. Sparkman.
The endorsement of the Presi
dential candidate was the first the
union had made since 191J6 and
the second in its history. UMW
hacked Franklin D. Roosevelt
when he sought his second term.
The resolution said, "In the event
of election, Eisenhower would be
the figurehead while Sen. Robert A.
Taft in reality would be the Presi
dent of the United States by proxy."
A majority of the delegates,
meanwhile, expressed belief there
would be a major strike in the na
tion's soft coal fields unless the WSB
approves the union's recently won
pay boosts. So far, some 5,000 min
ers have already left the pits be
cause the pay increase has not been
added to their paychecks.
