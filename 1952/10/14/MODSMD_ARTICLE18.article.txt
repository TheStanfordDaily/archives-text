NEW YORK, Oct. 13 (UP)—Sen.
Richard IVT. Nixon charged tonight
that Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson is un
fit for the Presidency because of
his role ;n the Alger Uiss perjury
cafe and because he has failed to
recognize the Communist, threat.
The Republican Vice-Presidential
nominee said in a nation-wide tele
vision and radio broadcast that the
Democratic Presidential '•andidate
was a voluntary character witness
for Hiss, and added:
"Let me empha;iz3 there is no
question in my mind as to the
loyalty of Mr. Stevenson, hut the
question is one as to his judgment
and it is a very grave question.
"He has failed to recognize the
threat, as many have failed to rec
ognize it around him. In my opin
ion his actions, his statements, his
record disqualify him from leading
the United States and the fine na
tions in the fight against Commu
nism at home and abroad."
Taking the offensive in a double
barreled blast a< the Democrats'
record on the Communist issue
and the role of Stevenson in the
ctsc of convicted perjurer Alger
Hiss, Nixon said that if the Demo
crats are elected in November the
nation can look forward to:
"Four more years of the lame
policy which has been so disastrous
at home and abroad in the past."
Nixon, who as a member of
the House Un - American Activities
Committee played a major role in
the conviction of Hiss, former high
State Department official, took the
Democratic candidate to task for
testifying by deposition during the
Hiss trial that the defendant was
known to him cs a man of good
reputation.
