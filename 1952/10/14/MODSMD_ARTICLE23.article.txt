# More Important Than You Think
## 
### 
It seems like such an unimportant, maybe
even a comical thing to do—to sign a false
name to a library card. A book is on two hour
reserve; you have a lot of reading to do; it's a
temptation to cheat on the system and keep the
book out all guarter.
But next time you're tempted! try recalling
these words: "Fundamental Standard." Then
perhaps you'll see what you're doing in a little
better perspective.
Any kind of misrepresentation means you're

violating Stanford's standard of conduct. At
least one student learned this the hard way
last week when he was sentenced by the Coun
cil for Student Control for signing a false name
on a Western Civ libe card.
The Fundamental Standard is a funny thing
•—it's always there to guide your conduct, no
matter what you're doing. So next time you're
tempted to cut a corner—even if it seems a
pretty small one to you — remember, you're
cheating your fellow students and what's even
more important —yourself.
