# BULL SESSION

### BOB STETSON 
The Bull Session in last Wednesday's paper on be
ing a good roommate said it was written by yours
truly (which it v/asn't). As a consequence the wrath
of my two roommates, Greg Danninger and Alee
Gerbode, was precipitated upon my tousled head.
It's a funny thing to read for the first time a .story
written by yourself. I read it while standing in line
to eat breakfast and was admiring my witty little
gem when it suddenly struck me I had not written it.
At 7 in the morning it is too early to get up and
certainly much too early to get mad. It has always
been my policy that whenever I want to read a good
newspaper stcry, I sit down and write one. But
having someone else (in this case Dxck Mansfield)
write a story by Bob Stetson is a delicious treat.
Speaking of roommates, mine always ridicule me
when 1 get up in the morning. I am told that from
the time I get out of bed until I have eaten break
fast I am in a trance and do not speak a word.
They spring out of bed at the first sound of the
alarm, frisky as young colts, throw open the win
dows, take cold showers, and scamper off to break
fast. Suggesting how to cure mv sullen early
morning condition, Alec, my roommate, said,
"What I really would like to do when we get up
is to turn on the radio, do callithetnics, or at IsaLt
say SOMETHING to each other."
To this I replied, "Alec, my son, you are entitled
to like to do whatever you want in the morning.
But I can truthfully state that the only thing I would
like to do when I get up is to go back to bed. No
small art is it to sleep; it is necessary to keep awake
all day for that purpose."
He then advanced the theory that maybe my
habit of sitting down and drinking a pot of black
coffee and smoking a pack oi' cigarettes before

going to bed might cause my morning miseries.
Foolish Alcc.
This same roommate likes to get up so well that
he has 8 o'clock classes six days a week and no more
classes during .the day until 1:15.

Water, a simple substance, is quite a dominating
factor in the life of Encina first-year men. In its
two forms of excess, much too much and none at
all, the thought of water never leaves a freshman's
mind.
As a first-year man approaches or departs from
picturesque Encina llall, his mind is filled with
but one thought, viz., water. Water in bags, water
in balloons, or just plain water is quite likely to
come cascading down upon him from any one of
the four floors above.
Water in all its many and diversified forms plagues
him throughout the morning. Fog from the heavens,
spray from an errant sprinkler, or just a plain puddle
of water.
After standing in line for lunch, water in its
other extreme comes to the fore. The old Encina
tradition of eating meals without water gnaws
thirstily at his squl. The tragedy cf Encina men
along this line is that they can afford nothing but
self-denial.
The dinner hymn of Encina men, "Water!" is
gaining popularity. It is not uncommon to hear
a hundred black, swollen tongues, cracked with
thirst, raised in stentorian disharmony: "Every day
we face the dinner plate without a drop of water.
Water! Cool, clear water!"
