# EX-FARM PROF SAYS:
## Political Parties Are Power Mad Gangs' 
### 
American political parties are "gangs athirst for power and
spoils, seeking the policy most likely to get votes," in the opinion
of Dr. Albert L. Guerard, Stanford historian and critic.
Dr. Guerard delivers this fiery denunciation in a criticism of
American politics written for the fall issue of the Pacific Spectator,
published today by Stanford Uni-*

versity Press.
He is a retired Stanford professor
of general literature, and now
teaches at Brandeis University in
Waltham, Massachusetts.
While Americans take it for
granted that their party system is
identical with democracy, he says,
"nothing could be more palpably
false. The party in power seeks to
exploit its victory. Yet, for the
minority, this is not. government by
consent, but government by force of
sheer number."
The actions of the minority party
are no less discreditable, Dr. Guerard
thinks.
"The party out of power strives
at every turn to hamper, confuse,
and vilify the man at the helm;
disloyalty l<> the nation's head is
its most imperative duty."
Men of intellect and integrity give
up in helpless despair, he $ays. And
the nation might "jog along" in
definitely with its present system,
looking upon its politics as "merely
a skin disease, annoying, disfigur
ing, but not likely to prove fatal."
Dr. Gucrard proposes four re
forms, fml of which is "reviving
the almost defunct representative
system." He calls upon the indi
vidual cit'zen to ignore party labels
and choose men of character and
ability.
Second, he proposes "direct, de
mocracy," or popular initiative and
referendum as already practiced in
California.
His third proposal is "an approxi

mation of the separation of powers.
The legislative has usurped execu
tive functions. And it has usurped
judicial functions as well. It is quali
fied for neither."
Finally, Dr. Guerard proposes
nomination of presidential candi
dates on a non-partisan basis.
