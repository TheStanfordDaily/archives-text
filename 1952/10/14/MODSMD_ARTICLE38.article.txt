Leave us face one nak d, brutal fact: Stanford looked GOOD la.st
Saim ..'ay.
Like the New York Yankees in a World Series, like FDR in a Presi
dential race, like Yehudi Menuhin in a violin content, they were not tu
be beaten.
NAfhen Sports Editor Bill Lciser of the San Francihco Chronicle, who has
been writing football more years than most of us have Leen around, says

that he can't remember a time wiien Stan
ford played better football, that means that
Slanl ncl was good. When Chuck Taylor, who
i amazingly stingy in after-game praise,
admit-, that "tiie boys played a very good
gome,' that means that the Indians were
goo J.
As we mentioned last week, heretofore
the Can'., have fait.-•red, they've stuttered,
they've made mistakes, but they always had
that mystei'iou., ability to be on the long oriel
cl the score after sixty football minuf.es.
There was nothing mysterious about last
week's victory. The downfield blocking was
the be t we've seen since we've been at the
Farm. Jijn Vick was particularly ferocious.

The defensive line was great in the true meaning of that word. The
Lucks were running with more reckless abandon than they had at any
other lime this season.
Forget (he last three touchdowns that OSC scored. Our reserves fum
bli d them nway in a moment of butter-fingered weakness.
It Was a Triiiin |>li of Individuals
Last Saturday's triumph has been described as a "team victory." And
just as this is true, it is also correct to say that it was the triumph of
individuals. Let's look at a few.
First, there was Joe St. Gem?. As a freshman, Joe quarterbacked the
yearling squad to a championship. He switched to halfback in his soph
year, since the quarterback post was already well taken care of. He
seemed to fade and last year was mired deep in the reserves. Since he
made med school and was elected senior class president last spring, he
decided, not to go out for football this year. Dapper George Lvnn, the
defensive backfield coach with the toothpaste ad smile, persuaded him
to give it a try.
Joe did, and what happened is history. He made a comeback and now
is our hardest tackling defensive backfielder. Not only that, but he
grabbed a Beaver aerial last week and wing-footed 50 yards to the goal.
Another individual triumph was that of Bill Rogers. Bill, the Fresno
soph with the shy smile, had always been a good halfback. Last Satur
day, he was more than a good halfback. He gave notice of future great
ness. The fact that he scampered 96 yards to break the record for the
longe.-.t Stanford run from scrimmage only tells half the story. The other
half is that on every play he was fighting, twisting, squirming for every
inch . . . the type of play that makes the difference between a good
runner and just another garden variety runner.
Remember that Bill's just a soph.
We can't write a column of this type without mentioning Dick Gant.
Gant was the outstanding lineman on the '54 frosh team. Last year, he
was injured a good part of the season and never quite made the grade.
This year, he had not played one minute of football going into the OSC
tiff. But A 1 Kirkland was injured, and so was his replacement, John
Stanton. This meant that Gant was thrown into the breach. For the rec
ord. heal o turned in a superb game, and played a prominent part in
that amazing goal-line stand, the high point of the game for Stanford.
How About tin' Future?
There were others . . . ends Ron Bush and Bob Hoegh; defensive back
Jack Runnels, wearing Dick Horn's number 54, tackling very hard indeed;
Barry Smith, a defensive tackle who had only played 10 minutes ah year,
stepping in for the injured John Broderick and emulating Gant's come
through performance; half Jimmy Stewart, the 155-pound hustler with
the movie actor monicker; half Charlie Brazel; and linebacker Marsh
Howe.
That's the past. Now, for the future. We don't subscribe to Toynbee's
theory of history repeating itself, but this could very well be the case
in the smog-filled Coliseum this weekend. The only difference is that
ihis year the opponent is UCLA. Last year, the Indians went down to
play an unsullied USC team, unsullied themselves.
Again this year, two unbeaten squads on the floor of the Coliseum.
Again, the PCC championship may be at stake, although not the Rose
Bowl. A law says that Stanford can't go to the Rose Bowl again. The
law says nothing about Stanford's not winning the conference gonfalon.
And if our beloved Indians continue doing what they did last week . . .
piece together the game that they were always capable of . . . well, who
knows what horizons thsy can reach?
There, I've said it.
