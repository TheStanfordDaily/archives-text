WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 (UP) —
The Supreme Court today gave Cal
ifornia BO days to state why the
court should not examine the Ari
zona-California dispute over divi
sion of Colorado River water.
Arizona Attorney General Fred
O. Wilson has requested permission
to file a complaint against the State
of California in the Supreme Court,
which is the usual procedure in
cases involving separate states.
The high bench is expected to
schedule arguments on whether the
dispute should be arbitrated in the
Supreme Court on receipt of Cali
fornia's reply. The court has al
ready agreed to settle a similar
quarrel between Texas and New
Mexico over division of water from
the Pio Grande River.
If the court takes the California-
Arizona matter, it will mark the
fourth time that a complaint by
Arizona over use of Colorado River
water has been under considera
tion. In each of the three previous
ca.-.cs the decision went against Ari
zona.
