### PHIL BERMAN 
Any hope,' 3 that there might
be a soft touch left on the Stan
ford football schadule this sea
son can more or less be dis
counted right now. A check of
the season's records of the In
dians' si:: remaining gridiron
loes shows that only one of
thein has a losing record for the
1 year.
All told, these future rivals have
compiled an 18-13 won and lost mark,
with only the Oregon Ducks having
the dubious honor of being below
| .500.
Three of the teams, USC. UCLA,
and Cal, are undefeated, while one
San Jose State, has been beaten but
once. The other, Washington, has
been humbled twice.
So, if the Cards do knock oft the
rest of their opponents on the foot
ball field and do sail through un
beaten, they will have the satis
faction of knowing that it was against
no soft touches.

defensive team this year, that only
two teams have managed to cross
thier goal line.

I passes. The only Washington touch
! downs came late in the final period.
Tom O Connell, the Illinois quarter
back. completed 14 out of 17 tosses.
San Jose State 40, Fresno State 0—

the ground and in the air.
USC 20, San Diego Navy 6—Con

the dubious honor of being below
| .500.

and Cal, are undefeated, while one
San Jose State, has been beaten but
once. The other, Washington, has
been humbled twice.
So, if the Cards do knock oft the

ball field and do sail through un
beaten, they will have the satis
faction of knowing that it was against
no soft touches.

harried all day, while tailback Ted
Narleski passed for two touchdowns.
The Uclans have shown such a tight
defensive team this year, that only
two teams have managed to cross
thier goal line.

j only the mercy of Illini Coach Ray
j Eliot, that kept the score down in

I passes. The only Washington touch
! downs came late in the final period.
Tom O Connell, the Illinois quarter
back. completed 14 out of 17 tosses.
