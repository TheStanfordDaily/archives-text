SUBS AT WORK—OSC's fullback, Sam Baker found it tough going even against Stanford's sec
ond stringers in the Stadium Saturday. Bringing down the Beaver after a short gain is Card Joe
St. Geirie (28), a first stringer. Subs in the background ready to help out are Dave Castellucci (27),
Joe (Tex) Long (35), Marsh Howe (50), and Dick Steere (55). It was the play of these unheralded
linemen that helped the Indians whip Oregon State, 41 to 28. —Daily photo by Bob Culver
