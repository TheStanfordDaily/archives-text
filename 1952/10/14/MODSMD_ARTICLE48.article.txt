# Band Manager Plagued By Bees in His Bandhouse
## Building Plans Are Approved 
### R.G. MANSFIELD 
"Oh, the bandhouse serves
the purpose. Only half of the
thing is condemned," Dwight
Allen will comment, when asked
about his most enduring prob
lem, the Stanford bandhouse.
Dwight Allen, the large, person
able student manager of Stanford's
marching band, has troubles. He has
a shortage of musicians and a short
age of time for practice. Of these
things he moans. But time has
brought him to be philosophical
about his greatest nemesis.
"I hear tell from an alumnus in
San Francisco that the place was a
saddle shed for ROTC cavalry and
a dressing room for the old stadium
before we took it over," says Allen.
"Now we've got bees. Every sea
son when we open the place up we
sweep out piles of bees. They live
back there near where the tuba
players sit. Sometimes they come
out of the woodwork in hordes.
One time when I was playing brass
bass my finger got to a valve just
after a bee did. We haven't even
got the place to ourselves."
To find the home of a marching
band rated among the best on the
Coast, you go out past the Pavilion
on Serra, turn left past the tennis
courts, and then look sharp to the
right. The-main body of the band
house is partially hidden by the
fallen - down porch, which is the
condemned part of the building.
"We used to practice out there,"
says Allen resignedly, "but the
floor kept caving in." Plans have
been made to tear the porch down
this year and throw it on the Big
Game bonfire.
The heating system in the band
house is a fireplace of uncertain
origin. No one seems to know if it
came with the building or was in
stalled later. It has sunk three
inches since it was put in, at any

rate. The band members burn any
thing they can get their hands on to
keep warm. Broken chairs, instru
ment cases, old field diagrams and
music all go into the fireplace when
the weather turns brisk.
"Then we have good wiring,
too," Allen puts in. "We had a
mystery light one time. It went
off and on of its own accord. Fi
nally somebody got into the wiring
and fixed it up. We have one
light we unscrew to turn off. For
awhile the boys cJidn't unscrew it
far enough, and every time a train
went by or somebody stamped his
feet, the light would go on again."
The new bandhouse. to replace
the current disgrace, is actually in
the planning stage. Plans have been
drawn up for a combination band
and orchestra building to replace
both the bandhouse and the hardly
less hazardous Woodpecker Lodge.
The new building, which is to be
built near Memorial Auditorium,
will have a central auditorium with
practice rooms for band and or
chestra on either side.
"We need musicians," Allen
moans. "We're 11 men short, and
we have a fancy program to work
up for this weekend and next. You
can bet we're still open to new
members. Especially a good bass
drummer, right now."
"And say," he adds, "anybody
who wants to try chasing away the
bees is welcome to . . . try. We've
tried everything—smoke, chemicals,
water — everything. And I don't
think the windows have been
washed in 20 years. Anybody who
wants to do that can come over to
the bandhouse anytime!"
