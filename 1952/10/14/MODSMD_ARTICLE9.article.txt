# U.S. Ponders Reports Of Russ Attack
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 (UP)
â€”The State Department awaited
a full report from the air force
today before deciding how to
handle the attack by Russian
fighter planes on an unarmed
American B-29 bomber.
The plane and its crew of eight
are presumed to have crashed after
the encounter with Soviet fighters
off the coast of Japan last Tuesday.
An oil slick on the water was the
only possible trace of the bomber
found by search planes.
The Air Force said its reports are
being turned over to the State De
partment as fast as they come in
and that the job should be com
pleted "very soon." A spokesman
said the Air Force will make no
recommendation, leaving any action
to the State Department.
In a note received by the State
Department today, Russia admit
ted its fighter planes fired on an
Ain eritan Superfortress but
charged that the plane violated
Soviet territory and fired on the
Soviet fighters first.
The Soviets made a "determined
protest" against the incident and
asked the United States to "adopt
measures to prevent violation of the
Soviet state frontier by American
aircraft."
The State Department had no
comment, but an Air Force
spokesman in Tokyo fiatly con
tradicted the Russian version. He
said the plane was unarmed and
was flying over Japanese territo
rial water when a radar screen
indicated it had been attacked.
Last words from the B-29 were a
"Mayday" international distress sig
nal and the tense exclamation of a
crewman, "Let's get the hell out of
here."
No trace of it has been found. The
Air Force said it may have glided
into Russian territory.
If the Air Force report bears
out the Tokyo version, the State
Department can be expected to
send a blistering protest to Mos
cow and possibly demand dam
ages for the missing plane and its
crew members.
This country has vigorously pro
tested two previous Russian attacks
on American planes and sent a re
port on a third one to the United
Nations. In each case, Russia not
only rejected the protests but. used
the incidents for propaganda pur
poses.
