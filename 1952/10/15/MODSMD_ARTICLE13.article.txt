## Travel, NATO Aid Relations 
### 
Many popular misconceptions be
tween Europe and America have
been mitigated by the large num
ber of Americans who have traveled
abroad or who were stationed there
during the war.
This was the statement with
which Britisher Kenneth Lindsay
opened his lecture last, night at the
Tuesday Evening Series. In a witty,
informal speech Lindsay went on to
highlight the most important Euro
pean-American policies.
He said that certainly many
differences and misunderstandings
that still exist would be cleared
up if more Europeans could afford
tn travel to the United States.
As far as Anglo-American rela
tions are concerned, Lindsay said,
"They are like Victorian children
who should be seen and not heard."
Europe, he said, is very hard to
define. The word means different
things to different people. For
many it connotates the Mediter
ranean countries, for others it is
France and Britain. But no defi
nition can encompass the vast,
nationalistic area that is really
Europe.
Lindsay cited NATO as the "moat
important body in existence" in do
ing the job of uniting present-day
Europe. "General Eisenhower," he
said, "did a magnificent job to pre
pare protective security in ad
vance."
Telling of his experiences at the
NATO meeting in Strassbourg.
Lindsay compared it to a European
parliament. "We sat in a horseshoe
circle as Europeans. We got to know
and respect each other, as we talked
abou our political, economic, and
cultural problems."
He went on to say that "No single
country. including the United
States, can defend itself alone."
Praising the Schuman Plan.
Lindsay said that by the spring of
1953 an integrated European mar
ket for coal will be in operation.
This economic co-operation should
be world-wide.
