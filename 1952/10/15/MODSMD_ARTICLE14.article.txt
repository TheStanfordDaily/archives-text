several thousand students jammed its vestibules for the guarterly booksale. Fiction, non-fiction,
technical works, and foreign books were disposed of for unbelievable fractions of their original
price. The man at the far left of the group is unidentified. The other students, from left to right,
are Pat Riordan, Bob Peterson, Bill Kennedy, Lynn Borders, Clayton Frye, and Zaki El Wattar.
