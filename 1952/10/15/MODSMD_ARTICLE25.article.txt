# It's Your Tuesday Series

How long has it been since you've gone to a
Tuesday Evening Series lecture?
H you're like the average Stanford student,
it's probably been quite awhile, for the fact is
thai the Tuesday Evening Series has met with
little popular response in recent years.
This situation is currently a matter of major
concern to a number of people—ASSU Exojrn
and the Public Exercises Committee among
them.
At the heart of the problem are a few popular
misunderstandings about the series—its pur
pose and its operation.
For example, many students seem to think
that the Tuesday lectures are intended pri
manly as a public service tor the people at
the surrounding area.
This couldn't be more wrong.
The chairman of Public Exercises states
firmly that the series are planned first of all
foj ih»3 students—as an additional educational
advantage that they could obtain in no other
way.
Quality is a prime criterion; the committee
wants to insure that the lecture will be on a
worthwhile subject, presented by a speaker
who knows what he's talking about. Presenting
a varied program, choosing subjects which will
interest a wide number of people—these are
other considerations.
It is plain to anyone who talks with the mem

bers of the Public Exercises Committee that
they are making a sincere effort to provide an
excellent lecture series. But they are working
against many obstacles.
First among these is the common Stanford
problem: money. The series can pay a
speaker no moie than $75, which olten barely
covers traveling expenses. Therefore, they
must utilize speakers who are willing to lec
ture as a public service.
The committee must also cope with the
dozens of problems which beset any group try
ing to arrange a series of events: fitting topics
into individual timetables, making use of spe
cial speakers when they are nearby, and so
forth.
But we believe that a successful series can
still be presented within these restrictions. Arid
you can help out.
Excom has appointed lean Leonard (Union)
and Fran Kirk (Village) to a committee to work
with Public Exercises Committee on the
series, li you have any suggestions or com
ments —tell them. Or call the Public Exer
cises office. And it you have a special in
terest in the Winter Quarter Series, do it right
away, because winter plans are already un
der way.
Remember—this is your series. If you aren't
satisfied with it, do something about it.
