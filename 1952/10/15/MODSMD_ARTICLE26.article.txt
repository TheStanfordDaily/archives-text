"Sure, Al."

to ;i'.v; rd this to offensive captain Jim Vick."

With which Kirkland handed
V'iok an untidily-wrapped red
1 ox. Vii'k opened it, and inside
wa a football with a handle on it.
It wa : a gesture, subtle as a meat
iixe, to xib the men who carry
the mail about their fumbling.
Viek, in a magnanimous inove
nvnt, handed the ball over to Bob

i iliback had an unblemished rec
oid of unsuccess in hanging onto

the ball.

NOW IT CAN BE TOLD DF.PT. Jack Bonetti,
offensive guard on last year's Rose Bowling Indian
leceived a singular honor.
Bonetti, now an assistant frosh coach, got a nice
scroll in the mail informing him that he had made
the 1951 Catholic All-American team.
'â€¢<><=, that's great," enthused Bonetti. "There's only
one trouble. I'm not Catholic."

A STRANGE ISLAND. A student named Fred was
traveling in Europe last summer and had reservations
on a small island off the French Riviera.
He took the train from Paris to the ferry depot at
the Riviera, boarded the ferry, and two hours later
disembarked at Isle Du Levant.
"Isle Du Levant! Isle Du Levant!! Why, this
isn't the island I had reservations on," exclaimed
Fred, ending his sentence in a preposition.
Fred was informed that the island that he wanted
to go to was far away, and it would take him eight
hours to go hark to shore and get another ferry
Mil to the island of his original intentions.
"So," decided Fred, *'I will stay on this island
instead."
"Fine," he was told, "Climb in this truck and we'll
take you to the hotel."
"Fred," who is a budding journalist, climbed into
the antiquated truck with six others, and the truck
bounced off towards the hotel. Several minutes later,
Fred noticed that the beautiful French girl sitting
next to him began unbuttoning her blouse. Fred, who
possesses a Jimmy Stewart shyness, turned the other
way. He observed that the others, of mixed sex,
were also peeling their clothes. Suddenly, the truck
whirled around the corner, and there were eight per
sons. Naked as jailbirds.
"Hey, what is this place!.." yelled Fred, "a train
ing ground for the Follies Bergere?" I
"No," answered the French girl, now stripped to
the huff, "this is a nudist colony."
"A "nudist colony! A nudist colony," screamed Fred,
"what did 112 do to deserve this? And do I also have
to take off . . .?"
"Yes," was the answer.
Fred spent four days on I;le Du Levant. For jour
nalistic reasons, of course.
