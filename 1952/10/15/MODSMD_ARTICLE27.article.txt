## 'Eisenhower... a Disappointment' 
### 
To thr Editor:
To a great many people, General Eisenhower has
been a terrible disappointment these past fow months.
Before and during the Republican convention, Mr.
Eisenhower appeared to the American people, Re
publican and Democratic alike, to be our salvation.
Here was a man who was fearless, untainted, and
who owed political tribute to no one. He was bigger

than the Republican and Democratic parties both; he
swept the country off its feet singlehanded.
Since that time the General has allied himself with
and become subservient to the faction with which lie
fought and disagreed so violently before the conven
tion. lie has surrendered his ideals for voles, con
duct which hardly becomes a crusader.
â€”CHARLES lIOPPE
