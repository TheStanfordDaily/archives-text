TOKYO, Wednesday. Oct. 15 (UP)
â€”Chinese troops swept American
and South Korean infantrymen oft
Triangle Hill and Sniper Ridge last
night but the U.S. soldiers swarmed
back this morning and captured
Triangle Hill.
At the same time, troops of the
South Korean Second Division
launched a new attack on Sniper
Ridge, a mile to the east of Tri
angle.
Angry Gl's of the Tf.R, 31st In
fantry Regiment who failed to win
thr crest of Triangle yesterday in
a bloody, 14-hour battle, stormed
the height at 10 a.m. (.1 p.m. PST
Tuesday) and an hour and -10 min
utes later were victorious on the
east-central front peak.
The American victory at Triangle,
coupled with a South Korean tri
umph near White Horse Mountain
to the west, left the UN forces in
their best position after a week of
teh heaviest fighting since October,
1951.
The battle-bloodied South Korean
Ninth Division ataoked through a
driving rain this morning and routed
the Chinese from all three knobs on
the northern end of the ridge lead
ing to White Horse and completed
their conquest of the peak north
west of Chorwon.
Two lesser peaks of the Triangle
range Jane Russell Knob and
Sandy Ridge- were taken under at
tack after the of the main hill
had been seized.
