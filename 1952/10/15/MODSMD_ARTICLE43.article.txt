It is doubtful whether we
would ever buy it, but by some
cjood fortune we have inherited
n book entitled "This Game of
Football," and it is writteh by
none other than Pappy Waldorf,
head man in the football setup
of our Berkeley neighbors.
The wizard of Strawberry Can
yon fails to disclose just how Stan
ford can whip the Bears, which
would make fascinating reading for
nil of us, but the author does delve
at some length into statistics and
their importance. This morning we
pass the following information along
in hopes thi-t it will provide talking
material while driving down south,
or perhaps give armchair quarter
barks a new slant on this Saturday
madness. '
Although a football game is of
C/l minutes' duration, the ball is
actually in play only 12 minutes.
The rest of the time is spent in
huddling and putting the ball in
play. The clock is stopped be
tween 70 ami 100 times each game.
During the course of these 12
minutes a team will have an aver
age of 03 chances to advance the
ball.
One team will come into posses
sion of the ball for a series of plays
13 times during the game. This is
the most consistent of all statistics
and seldom varies. Perhaps they
vviil fumble on first down or drive
for a score using 15 consecutive
plays. Willi only 13 series the of
fensive team must make the most of
each one.
One learn will punt five or six
times during a game. This varies
widely against a tough team or
depending on weather conditions.
The intercepted pass is an item
of great importance. One pass in
tereepted in every nine or ten
thrown is normal, but if one pass in
six or seven thrown is intercepted,
that factor alone will probably lead
to defeat.
So football filberts tuck those
stats under your caps while we
thank Pappy for bestowing all this
\ipon us in his really fine book,
"This Game of Football."
