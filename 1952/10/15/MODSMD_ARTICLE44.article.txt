## 
### 
Trainer Connie Jarvis stated that
Stanford will go into the UCLA con
test in its best physical shape of the
year.
Every member of the team is fit
and ready to go ... a football rarity
in this day of multiple substitutes
and multiple injuries. End Ron
Eadie, halfs Skip Crist and Dave
Eldridge, and tackles John Brode
rick, John Stanton, and Al Kirkland
have all thrown off their injuries and
will play this weekend.
The team ran through a scrim
mage yesterday in which half Ron

Cook broke away for a touchdown
and in which Bob Mathias almost
did. Bill Rogers, the half of 9G yards
fame, gave the coaching staff an
anxious moment when he didn't get
up after a tackle. He hurt his ankle,
but the injury proved to be slight
and 10 minutes later he was prac
ticing again.
The Taylormen worked on several
new plays for UCLA, one of which
was classified as "top secret."
