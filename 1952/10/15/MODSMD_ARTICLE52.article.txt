# Weismann: A Non-Political Leader
## 
### WIN GRIFFITH 
On April 30 01 this year, 3,311
Stanford students cast votes in
the ASSU election to choose a
president.
Dick Weismann, an amiable
poly sci major with red hair,
freckles, and a warm smile, re-

I coivod 1,883 of those votes. He
defeated three other candidates
and became president in one of
the most decisive victories in
ASSU election history.
That election was not the only
demonstration of Weismann's per
| sonal appeal to the people with
[ whom he lives and works. In all
the stuc'er.t organizations of which
j he has been a part, he has reached
the top leadership position, and in
each instance with as much deci
! siveness as his election to the ASSU
I presidency. He was also president
of the student body at Burlingame
j High School, last May he was elect
ed president of the Pacific Student
President Association at its confer
ence in Seattle, and his record in
cludes many other high - ranking
student body positions.
The skeptic would question such
success. He would say it is the
result of a consciously developed
faculty for catching that all-im
portant, bread-giving idol of the
politician — the vote. He would
wonder if Weismann has modified
and revised his ideas and attitudes
with the express purpose of gar
nering the support and approval
of the voter. With a wry smile,
he would ask, "What kind of a
person is Dick Weismann? Why
does he take on the work and re
sponsibility involved in student
body activities?"
An interview with the ASSU
president answered those questions,
disproved some of those misconcep
tions, and gave indication of the
type of leader the Associated Stu
dents will have for the year 1952-
53.
Weismann is not a politician, at
least not in the crude definition of
that term. Nor is he a master crafts
man in the art - of - being - elected
president. The collective approval
of Weismann by students is not the
result of a "revision of his ideas and
attitudes." His agreement with most
of the ideas and attitudes of the
Stanford student body is sincere, not j
hypocritically designed to win sup
port. His agreement is the result of
a personality conditioned by his j
own history and upbringing.
At Stanford, the current ASSU
president thinks, acts, and speaks
with a "Stanford" attitude. If a
comparison between an individ
ual and an institution is possible,
he has demonstrated qualities and
characteristics which are similar
to the whole University.
His tastes, manner, and actions
show a tendency to conservatism, i
Throughout his work on various I
student organizations he has been 1

j consistently reluctant to push any
idea which might be termed "radi
| cal." He believes in gradual change.
He believes that the impetus for
change should come from the stu
j dents themselves, and he believes
that it is his responsibility as ASSU
president to maintain an aware
■ ness of their desires and attitudes.
But Weismann is not so naive
as to think that every blade of
' grass on the Stanford campus is
perfect. He has said that such
I current questions as the "Liquor
Resolution" and the "Lone Wom-
I an Rule" arc ready for action and
that the changes are justified.
This year's ASSU president con
siders "student contact" an impor
tant part of his responsibility. He
has no definite "program" for the
year, but he thinks that it is im
portant for the students to be aware
of the aims of their government.
He is interested in seeing that the
'awareness" is established, and he
I hopes that through the efforts of the
ASSU officers Stanford students
I may appreciate and respect more
keenly such aspects of Stanford life
as the Honor Code, the foreign stu
dent program, student freedom in
their activities, and the friendliness
of the campus.
Weismann enjoys his work, and
it is partly for that reason and
partly fcr his sense of responsi
bility (hat he is conscientious
about his duties. Students who
have worked with him will testify
that he is not the tvpe of person

I who would sit down in his vvell
! furnished olTice after a successful
I election and spend a year throw
ing darts at the ASSU calendar.
His duties require at least 20
I hours of work a week, and much
of the rest of his time is spent in
| directly with student body affairs.
' During this school year, he will not
content himself merely with the
j fulfillment of defined ASSU presi
i dential duties but will continue to
act as a sort of public relations man
for the University and the student
j organization.
And Dick Weismann is well prc
; pared for this and his other tasks.
The students of Stanford may be
satisfied that his administrative
ability, conscientiousness, and sin
cerity will enable him to offer them
the type of leadership they desire.
| Above all, his synonymous relation
with Stanford qualifies him as an
j ideal representative in his position
as ASSU president.

On April 30 01 this year, 3,311
Stanford students cast votes in
the ASSU election to choose a
president.
Dick Weismann, an amiable
poly sci major with red hair,
freckles, and a warm smile, re-

I coivod 1,883 of those votes. He
defeated three other candidates
and became president in one of
the most decisive victories in
ASSU election history.
That election was not the only
demonstration of Weismann's per
| sonal appeal to the people with
[ whom he lives and works. In all
the stuc'er.t organizations of which
j he has been a part, he has reached
the top leadership position, and in
each instance with as much deci
! siveness as his election to the ASSU
I presidency. He was also president
of the student body at Burlingame
j High School, last May he was elect
ed president of the Pacific Student
President Association at its confer
ence in Seattle, and his record in
cludes many other high - ranking
student body positions.
The skeptic would question such
success. He would say it is the
result of a consciously developed
faculty for catching that all-im
portant, bread-giving idol of the
politician — the vote. He would
wonder if Weismann has modified
and revised his ideas and attitudes
with the express purpose of gar
nering the support and approval
of the voter. With a wry smile,
he would ask, "What kind of a
person is Dick Weismann? Why
does he take on the work and re
sponsibility involved in student
body activities?"
An interview with the ASSU
president answered those questions,
disproved some of those misconcep
tions, and gave indication of the
type of leader the Associated Stu
dents will have for the year 1952-
53.
Weismann is not a politician, at
least not in the crude definition of
that term. Nor is he a master crafts
man in the art - of - being - elected
president. The collective approval
of Weismann by students is not the
result of a "revision of his ideas and
attitudes." His agreement with most
of the ideas and attitudes of the
Stanford student body is sincere, not j
hypocritically designed to win sup
port. His agreement is the result of
a personality conditioned by his j
own history and upbringing.
At Stanford, the current ASSU
president thinks, acts, and speaks
with a "Stanford" attitude. If a
comparison between an individ
ual and an institution is possible,
he has demonstrated qualities and
characteristics which are similar
to the whole University.
His tastes, manner, and actions
show a tendency to conservatism, i
Throughout his work on various I
student organizations he has been 1

j consistently reluctant to push any
idea which might be termed "radi
| cal." He believes in gradual change.
He believes that the impetus for
change should come from the stu
j dents themselves, and he believes
that it is his responsibility as ASSU
president to maintain an aware
■ ness of their desires and attitudes.
But Weismann is not so naive
as to think that every blade of
' grass on the Stanford campus is
perfect. He has said that such
I current questions as the "Liquor
Resolution" and the "Lone Wom-
I an Rule" arc ready for action and
that the changes are justified.
This year's ASSU president con
siders "student contact" an impor
tant part of his responsibility. He
has no definite "program" for the
year, but he thinks that it is im
portant for the students to be aware
of the aims of their government.
He is interested in seeing that the
'awareness" is established, and he
I hopes that through the efforts of the
ASSU officers Stanford students
I may appreciate and respect more
keenly such aspects of Stanford life
as the Honor Code, the foreign stu
dent program, student freedom in
their activities, and the friendliness
of the campus.
Weismann enjoys his work, and
it is partly for that reason and
partly fcr his sense of responsi
bility (hat he is conscientious
about his duties. Students who
have worked with him will testify
that he is not the tvpe of person

I who would sit down in his vvell
! furnished olTice after a successful
I election and spend a year throw
ing darts at the ASSU calendar.
His duties require at least 20
I hours of work a week, and much
of the rest of his time is spent in
| directly with student body affairs.
' During this school year, he will not
content himself merely with the
j fulfillment of defined ASSU presi
i dential duties but will continue to
act as a sort of public relations man
for the University and the student
j organization.
And Dick Weismann is well prc
; pared for this and his other tasks.
The students of Stanford may be
satisfied that his administrative
ability, conscientiousness, and sin
cerity will enable him to offer them
the type of leadership they desire.
| Above all, his synonymous relation
with Stanford qualifies him as an
j ideal representative in his position

Stanford students cast votes in
the ASSU election to choose a
president.
Dick Weismann, an amiable
poly sci major with red hair,
freckles, and a warm smile, re-

I coivod 1,883 of those votes. He
defeated three other candidates
and became president in one of
the most decisive victories in
ASSU election history.
That election was not the only
demonstration of Weismann's per
| sonal appeal to the people with
[ whom he lives and works. In all
the stuc'er.t organizations of which
j he has been a part, he has reached
the top leadership position, and in
each instance with as much deci
! siveness as his election to the ASSU
I presidency. He was also president
of the student body at Burlingame
j High School, last May he was elect
ed president of the Pacific Student
President Association at its confer
ence in Seattle, and his record in
cludes many other high - ranking
student body positions.
The skeptic would question such
success. He would say it is the
result of a consciously developed
faculty for catching that all-im
portant, bread-giving idol of the
politician — the vote. He would
wonder if Weismann has modified
and revised his ideas and attitudes
with the express purpose of gar
nering the support and approval
of the voter. With a wry smile,
he would ask, "What kind of a
person is Dick Weismann? Why
does he take on the work and re
sponsibility involved in student
body activities?"
An interview with the ASSU
president answered those questions,
disproved some of those misconcep
tions, and gave indication of the
type of leader the Associated Stu
dents will have for the year 1952-
53.
Weismann is not a politician, at
least not in the crude definition of
that term. Nor is he a master crafts
man in the art - of - being - elected
president. The collective approval
of Weismann by students is not the
result of a "revision of his ideas and
attitudes." His agreement with most
of the ideas and attitudes of the
Stanford student body is sincere, not j
hypocritically designed to win sup
port. His agreement is the result of
a personality conditioned by his j
own history and upbringing.
At Stanford, the current ASSU
president thinks, acts, and speaks
with a "Stanford" attitude. If a
comparison between an individ
ual and an institution is possible,
he has demonstrated qualities and
characteristics which are similar
to the whole University.
His tastes, manner, and actions
show a tendency to conservatism, i
Throughout his work on various I
student organizations he has been 1

j consistently reluctant to push any
idea which might be termed "radi
| cal." He believes in gradual change.
He believes that the impetus for
change should come from the stu
j dents themselves, and he believes
that it is his responsibility as ASSU
president to maintain an aware
■ ness of their desires and attitudes.
But Weismann is not so naive
as to think that every blade of
' grass on the Stanford campus is
perfect. He has said that such
I current questions as the "Liquor
Resolution" and the "Lone Wom-
I an Rule" arc ready for action and
that the changes are justified.
This year's ASSU president con
siders "student contact" an impor
tant part of his responsibility. He
has no definite "program" for the
year, but he thinks that it is im
portant for the students to be aware
of the aims of their government.
He is interested in seeing that the
'awareness" is established, and he
I hopes that through the efforts of the
ASSU officers Stanford students
I may appreciate and respect more
keenly such aspects of Stanford life
as the Honor Code, the foreign stu
dent program, student freedom in
their activities, and the friendliness
of the campus.
Weismann enjoys his work, and
it is partly for that reason and
partly fcr his sense of responsi
bility (hat he is conscientious
about his duties. Students who
have worked with him will testify
that he is not the tvpe of person

I who would sit down in his vvell
! furnished olTice after a successful
I election and spend a year throw
ing darts at the ASSU calendar.
His duties require at least 20
I hours of work a week, and much
of the rest of his time is spent in
| directly with student body affairs.
' During this school year, he will not
content himself merely with the
j fulfillment of defined ASSU presi
i dential duties but will continue to
act as a sort of public relations man
for the University and the student
j organization.
And Dick Weismann is well prc
