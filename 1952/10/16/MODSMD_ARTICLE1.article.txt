### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., OH. 15
(UP) â€” Russia moved tonight to
force a full-.'cale United Nations
General Assembly debate on the
Korean war before the U.S. Presi
dential election.
Soviet Delegate Andrei Y. Gro
myko made the proposal for prior
ity treatment of the Korean crisis
in the face of wide feeling here that
the debate on the Panmunjom truce
deadlock should be deferred until
after the United States goes to the
polls Nov. 4.
The steering committee took no
decision on Gromyko's move to
switch the Korean issue from its
current number three spot to the
head of the business list.
'I he decision on what comes first
is up to the political committee it
self. But Gromyko's action stirred
considerable speculation as to
whether the Russians have hopes
of influencing the outcome of this
Presidential election.
Secretary of State Dean Acheson
is due to speak today and Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Y. Vishin
sky is slated for tomorrow.
