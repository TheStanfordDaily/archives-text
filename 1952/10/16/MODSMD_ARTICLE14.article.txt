# Homecoming Decoration Plan Canceled
## 
### 
This year the USC homecoming
weekend, Nov. 7 and 8, will feature
only a float parade. There will be
no house decorations.
Roy Alexander, president, of Car
dinals, yesterday outlined to The
Daily Cardinals' reasons for this
decision. They are:
1. A Itclter fob is done if stu
dents' efforts are conrentratrd on
one project rather than diluted
over two or more.
2. Nov. 7 and 8 will be a mid
term weekend for many students
and the preparation of both a float
and house decorations is too heavy
a load for those working on the
activities.
2. The float parade is a more
democratic type of activity since it
represents the work of a greater
number of students. The house dec
orations Rive emphasis to Row resi
dences and minimize the credit due
the efforts of off-campus, Village,
and dorm residents.
4. The float parade is a larger
drawing card for alums and SC
guests. After the parade Friday
night, floats may be drawn up be
fore the dorms and houses and the
winning floats will be paraded
around the stadium at the game
Saturday.
5. Houses will be cleaner and oth
erwise more presentable to alums
and guests if students are not in
volved in the process of decoration,
which is usually a messy one.
The theme of flic float parade
will be "Indians Prepare Reser
vation for Trojan Trip-up."
The underlying theme of the
j whole weekend, of course, will be
that of welcome to alums and visit
ing SC students. Members of Car
dinals, sponsors of the homecoming
weekend, for weeks have been pre
paring a wclcome which involves
correspondence to alums and SC
students and the organization of
open houses, tours, and welcoming
committees.
