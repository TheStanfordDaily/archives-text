# Stevenson Lowers Boom on Republican Old Guard; Praises Roosevelt, Truman
## 
### HADLEY ROFF Daily Political Editor 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 15—Democratic standard bearer Adlai
Stevenson outlined the Democratic party ideals for peace and
prosperity and lambasted the Republican "old guard" in a sizzling
dramatic speech at the Cow Palace here last night.
An estimated 23,000 persons jammed the giant pavilion to heat

the Illinois Governor deliver one of
the most hard-hitting political ad
dresses of the campaign.
After declaring, "The Democratic
program is dedicated to two main
objectives: achieving peace in the
world, and continuing our well-be
ing, our good times here at home,"
Stevenson cracked off angrily at
what he charged was the "fright
ened attitude of the Republicans."
"We want Stevenson," rolled up
from the crowd like a wild wave
when Attorney General Pat Brown,
who introduced the candidate, sig
naled as the Governor was ap
proaching the rostrum.
And the tremendous call contin
ued for three minutes despite the
protests of the time-conscious tele
vision cameramen.
As Stevenson spoke, a wide smile
flashed across his face. Particularly
when he said, "... I don't believe,
as some say ,that I have talked over
anyone's head," and the audience
burst into "Noooo," and yelled,
"We're with you, Adlai."
"Never have so many said so
much so loudly—about so little,"
Stevenson said of the Republi
cans.
He continued, "I confess that
Republican campaign still fills me
with something like awe. They have
all that money, all those newspa
pers, all those advertising agencies,
all those balloons, all those slogan
makers and sky writers, and they
have all that confetti for all those
'spontaneous' demonstrations."
"It must be the biggest year in
the confetti business since Lind
bergh flew (he Atlantic," he
charged.
"But," he said, "I suppose ele
phants always were mcanl to
travel in circuses."
The White House hopeful, his ex
pression thoughtful, outlined Demo
cratic policy saying, "The secret of

our program—and of our success—
ii that the Democratic party cares
about people."
"I do not mean to suggest that all
our problems are solved," he con
tinued. "The world is complex and
imperfect at best; and the day's
business will never be finished."
Stevenson declared the chief
measures for securing peace and
prosperity is confidence and self
respect; "confidence in ourselves
as free and fortunate people,
proud and respectful of ourselves
and of our fellow men, and com -
petent to deal constructively and
successfully with the ponderous
problems of our society and our
world."
"We reject the negative, com
plaining, frightened attitude c.f the
Republicans," he declared firmly.
He said the best bulwark against
Russian aggression and atomic war
is building international cohesion
through collective security.
The best means for continuing
prosperity, according to the Illinoi
an, is to continue the economic
scheems initiated 20 years ago when
the New Deal soared to power.
"To maintain our prosperity," he
asserted, "we must maintain the
buying power of the people."
"The Democratic party lias
helped l ' to do this," he said, "by
minimum wage and collective
bargaining laws for the workers,
by price support-, for the farmers,
by social insurance for the elder
ly, the sick, the unemployed, and
by a tax system which presses
least heavily on those least able
to bear the burden."
He went on, applause swelling
in the vast auditorium, "Thrse
are the tested and proven policies
of the past 211 years. They were
initiated by the boldness and the
vision of a great Democrat,

I Franklin Roo'.evelt, and tbey were
enlarged and consolidated by an
other great Democrat — Harry
Truman."
Stevenson, his smile hard and
grim, then lowered the boom.
He characterized the so - called
Republican old guard—namely Sen
ators Taft of Ohio, Malone of Ne
vada, Jenner cf Indiana, to single
out a few of those scored by Ste
venson as "a stubborn, obstinate
group of men—men who have had
to be dragged, screaming and kick
ing, into the 20th century."
From then on out, the oratorical
fireworks sparkled.
Warming to the attack, Stevenson
said, "The general tell- us not to
worry. 'Government,' he said, 'is
just a matter of team work.' But
that doesn't encourage us; we know
j the names and have the numbers of
| the players on the general's team."
Stevenson then described an im
! aginary team roster for the GOP
Quartcrbacking the Republican
squad, predicted Stevenson, will
be Senator Taft. Of the Qhioan,
Stevenson said, "He stands in di
rect opposition to the policies of
strength and progress, at home
and abroad. He has won consum
ing conviction—it is that govern
ment should not act at all. if po:;-
j sible, and not much if impossible."
With the mention of "Taft," the
crowd sounded a resounding "boo."
At left half, according to Steven
son, would be Senator Richard Nix
on, Eisenhower's running mate.
Nixon's name also was greeted
with boo 3.
At right half will be Indiana's
Jenner.
"There is no more consistent iso
lationist,, no more profound reac -
tionary in the Senate than Jenner
of Indiana," Stevenson charged.
In the line, Stevenson sees Sena
tor Malone of Nevada, Senatoi Ec
ton of Montana, and Senator Wat
kins of Utah. "And," lie added,
"'there arc a lot more . . . who have
fought every measure for social
progress and international cecurity
which has come up before the Sen
ate."
Then, his voice sinking dramati
cally, he pointed out, "Tito general
I has called for the re-election of
I every one of them."
"Do you want these men on
your team? Will tbey b? good for
Ibis country?" Stevenson asked,
j Ami the vast audience shouted,
"No, no, no."
When the tumult died, Stevenr-.on
I quietly inquired, ". . . does any
one think he would really stand t
chance against this team of isola
tionists and cut - throat reaction
aries?"
Stevenson concluded his speech,
j raying "We promise no miracles. I

DADDY OF THE DEMOS—Governor Adlai Stevenson was given an enthusiastic welcome last
night when he told an estimated 23,000 persons who crammod into San Francisco's Cow Palace
that the Democratic program is dedicated to achieving peace in the world.
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 15—Democratic standard bearer Adlai
Stevenson outlined the Democratic party ideals for peace and
prosperity and lambasted the Republican "old guard" in a sizzling
dramatic speech at the Cow Palace here last night.
An estimated 23,000 persons jammed the giant pavilion to heat

the Illinois Governor deliver one of
the most hard-hitting political ad
dresses of the campaign.
After declaring, "The Democratic
program is dedicated to two main
objectives: achieving peace in the
world, and continuing our well-be
ing, our good times here at home,"
Stevenson cracked off angrily at
what he charged was the "fright
ened attitude of the Republicans."
"We want Stevenson," rolled up
from the crowd like a wild wave
when Attorney General Pat Brown,
who introduced the candidate, sig
naled as the Governor was ap
proaching the rostrum.
And the tremendous call contin
ued for three minutes despite the
protests of the time-conscious tele
vision cameramen.
As Stevenson spoke, a wide smile
flashed across his face. Particularly
when he said, "... I don't believe,
as some say ,that I have talked over
anyone's head," and the audience
burst into "Noooo," and yelled,
"We're with you, Adlai."
"Never have so many said so
much so loudly—about so little,"
Stevenson said of the Republi
cans.
He continued, "I confess that
Republican campaign still fills me
with something like awe. They have
all that money, all those newspa
pers, all those advertising agencies,
all those balloons, all those slogan
makers and sky writers, and they
have all that confetti for all those
'spontaneous' demonstrations."
"It must be the biggest year in
the confetti business since Lind
bergh flew (he Atlantic," he
charged.
"But," he said, "I suppose ele
phants always were mcanl to
travel in circuses."
The White House hopeful, his ex
pression thoughtful, outlined Demo
cratic policy saying, "The secret of

our program—and of our success—
ii that the Democratic party cares
about people."
"I do not mean to suggest that all
our problems are solved," he con
tinued. "The world is complex and
imperfect at best; and the day's
business will never be finished."
Stevenson declared the chief
measures for securing peace and
prosperity is confidence and self
respect; "confidence in ourselves
as free and fortunate people,
proud and respectful of ourselves
and of our fellow men, and com -
petent to deal constructively and
successfully with the ponderous
problems of our society and our
world."
"We reject the negative, com
plaining, frightened attitude c.f the
Republicans," he declared firmly.
He said the best bulwark against
Russian aggression and atomic war
is building international cohesion
through collective security.
The best means for continuing
prosperity, according to the Illinoi
an, is to continue the economic
scheems initiated 20 years ago when
the New Deal soared to power.
"To maintain our prosperity," he
asserted, "we must maintain the
buying power of the people."
"The Democratic party lias
helped l ' to do this," he said, "by
minimum wage and collective
bargaining laws for the workers,
by price support-, for the farmers,
by social insurance for the elder
ly, the sick, the unemployed, and
by a tax system which presses
least heavily on those least able
to bear the burden."
He went on, applause swelling
in the vast auditorium, "Thrse
are the tested and proven policies
of the past 211 years. They were
initiated by the boldness and the
vision of a great Democrat,

I Franklin Roo'.evelt, and tbey were
enlarged and consolidated by an
other great Democrat — Harry
Truman."
Stevenson, his smile hard and
grim, then lowered the boom.
He characterized the so - called
Republican old guard—namely Sen
ators Taft of Ohio, Malone of Ne
vada, Jenner cf Indiana, to single
out a few of those scored by Ste
venson as "a stubborn, obstinate
group of men—men who have had
to be dragged, screaming and kick
ing, into the 20th century."
From then on out, the oratorical
fireworks sparkled.
Warming to the attack, Stevenson
said, "The general tell- us not to
worry. 'Government,' he said, 'is
just a matter of team work.' But
that doesn't encourage us; we know
j the names and have the numbers of
| the players on the general's team."
Stevenson then described an im
! aginary team roster for the GOP
Quartcrbacking the Republican
squad, predicted Stevenson, will
be Senator Taft. Of the Qhioan,
Stevenson said, "He stands in di
rect opposition to the policies of
strength and progress, at home

by a tax system which presses

Stevenson, his smile hard and
grim, then lowered the boom.

With the mention of "Taft," the
crowd sounded a resounding "boo."

Nixon's name also was greeted
with boo 3.
At right half will be Indiana's

"There is no more consistent iso

In the line, Stevenson sees Sena

DADDY OF THE DEMOS—Governor Adlai Stevenson was given an enthusiastic welcome last
night when he told an estimated 23,000 persons who crammod into San Francisco's Cow Palace
that the Democratic program is dedicated to achieving peace in the world.
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 15—Democratic standard bearer Adlai
Stevenson outlined the Democratic party ideals for peace and
prosperity and lambasted the Republican "old guard" in a sizzling
dramatic speech at the Cow Palace here last night.
An estimated 23,000 persons jammed the giant pavilion to heat

the Illinois Governor deliver one of
the most hard-hitting political ad
dresses of the campaign.
After declaring, "The Democratic
program is dedicated to two main
objectives: achieving peace in the
world, and continuing our well-be
ing, our good times here at home,"
Stevenson cracked off angrily at
what he charged was the "fright
ened attitude of the Republicans."
"We want Stevenson," rolled up
from the crowd like a wild wave
when Attorney General Pat Brown,
who introduced the candidate, sig
naled as the Governor was ap
proaching the rostrum.
And the tremendous call contin
ued for three minutes despite the
protests of the time-conscious tele
vision cameramen.
As Stevenson spoke, a wide smile
flashed across his face. Particularly
when he said, "... I don't believe,
as some say ,that I have talked over
anyone's head," and the audience
burst into "Noooo," and yelled,
"We're with you, Adlai."
"Never have so many said so
much so loudly—about so little,"
Stevenson said of the Republi
cans.
He continued, "I confess that
Republican campaign still fills me
with something like awe. They have
all that money, all those newspa
pers, all those advertising agencies,
all those balloons, all those slogan
makers and sky writers, and they
have all that confetti for all those
'spontaneous' demonstrations."
"It must be the biggest year in
the confetti business since Lind
bergh flew (he Atlantic," he
charged.
"But," he said, "I suppose ele
phants always were mcanl to
travel in circuses."
The White House hopeful, his ex
pression thoughtful, outlined Demo
cratic policy saying, "The secret of

our program—and of our success—
ii that the Democratic party cares
about people."
"I do not mean to suggest that all
our problems are solved," he con
tinued. "The world is complex and
imperfect at best; and the day's
business will never be finished."
Stevenson declared the chief
measures for securing peace and
prosperity is confidence and self
respect; "confidence in ourselves
as free and fortunate people,
proud and respectful of ourselves
and of our fellow men, and com -
petent to deal constructively and
successfully with the ponderous
problems of our society and our
world."
"We reject the negative, com
plaining, frightened attitude c.f the
Republicans," he declared firmly.
He said the best bulwark against
Russian aggression and atomic war
is building international cohesion
through collective security.
The best means for continuing
prosperity, according to the Illinoi
an, is to continue the economic
scheems initiated 20 years ago when
the New Deal soared to power.

burst into "Noooo," and yelled,
"We're with you, Adlai."
"Never have so many said so
much so loudly—about so little,"
Stevenson said of the Republi
cans.
He continued, "I confess that
Republican campaign still fills me
with something like awe. They have
all that money, all those newspa
pers, all those advertising agencies,
all those balloons, all those slogan
makers and sky writers, and they
have all that confetti for all those
'spontaneous' demonstrations."
"It must be the biggest year in
the confetti business since Lind
bergh flew (he Atlantic," he
charged.
"But," he said, "I suppose ele
phants always were mcanl to
travel in circuses."
The White House hopeful, his ex
pression thoughtful, outlined Demo
cratic policy saying, "The secret of

our program—and of our success—
ii that the Democratic party cares
about people."
"I do not mean to suggest that all
our problems are solved," he con
tinued. "The world is complex and
imperfect at best; and the day's
business will never be finished."
Stevenson declared the chief
measures for securing peace and
prosperity is confidence and self
respect; "confidence in ourselves
as free and fortunate people,
proud and respectful of ourselves
and of our fellow men, and com -
petent to deal constructively and
successfully with the ponderous
problems of our society and our
world."
"We reject the negative, com
plaining, frightened attitude c.f the
Republicans," he declared firmly.
He said the best bulwark against
Russian aggression and atomic war
is building international cohesion
through collective security.
The best means for continuing
prosperity, according to the Illinoi
an, is to continue the economic
scheems initiated 20 years ago when
the New Deal soared to power.
"To maintain our prosperity," he
asserted, "we must maintain the
buying power of the people."
"The Democratic party lias
helped l ' to do this," he said, "by
minimum wage and collective
bargaining laws for the workers,
by price support-, for the farmers,
by social insurance for the elder
ly, the sick, the unemployed, and
by a tax system which presses
least heavily on those least able
to bear the burden."
He went on, applause swelling
in the vast auditorium, "Thrse
are the tested and proven policies
of the past 211 years. They were
initiated by the boldness and the
vision of a great Democrat,

I Franklin Roo'.evelt, and tbey were
enlarged and consolidated by an
other great Democrat — Harry
Truman."
Stevenson, his smile hard and
grim, then lowered the boom.
He characterized the so - called
Republican old guard—namely Sen
ators Taft of Ohio, Malone of Ne
vada, Jenner cf Indiana, to single
out a few of those scored by Ste
venson as "a stubborn, obstinate
group of men—men who have had
to be dragged, screaming and kick
ing, into the 20th century."
From then on out, the oratorical
fireworks sparkled.
Warming to the attack, Stevenson
said, "The general tell- us not to
worry. 'Government,' he said, 'is
just a matter of team work.' But
that doesn't encourage us; we know
j the names and have the numbers of
| the players on the general's team."
Stevenson then described an im
! aginary team roster for the GOP
Quartcrbacking the Republican
squad, predicted Stevenson, will
be Senator Taft. Of the Qhioan,
Stevenson said, "He stands in di
rect opposition to the policies of
strength and progress, at home
and abroad. He has won consum
ing conviction—it is that govern
ment should not act at all. if po:;-
j sible, and not much if impossible."
With the mention of "Taft," the
crowd sounded a resounding "boo."
At left half, according to Steven
son, would be Senator Richard Nix
on, Eisenhower's running mate.
Nixon's name also was greeted
with boo 3.
At right half will be Indiana's
Jenner.
"There is no more consistent iso
lationist,, no more profound reac -
tionary in the Senate than Jenner
of Indiana," Stevenson charged.
In the line, Stevenson sees Sena
tor Malone of Nevada, Senatoi Ec
ton of Montana, and Senator Wat
kins of Utah. "And," lie added,
"'there arc a lot more . . . who have
fought every measure for social
progress and international cecurity
which has come up before the Sen

Then, his voice sinking dramati
cally, he pointed out, "Tito general

"Do you want these men on

"No, no, no."

DADDY OF THE DEMOS—Governor Adlai Stevenson was given an enthusiastic welcome last
night when he told an estimated 23,000 persons who crammod into San Francisco's Cow Palace
that the Democratic program is dedicated to achieving peace in the world.
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 15—Democratic standard bearer Adlai
Stevenson outlined the Democratic party ideals for peace and
prosperity and lambasted the Republican "old guard" in a sizzling
dramatic speech at the Cow Palace here last night.
An estimated 23,000 persons jammed the giant pavilion to heat

the Illinois Governor deliver one of
the most hard-hitting political ad
dresses of the campaign.
After declaring, "The Democratic
program is dedicated to two main
objectives: achieving peace in the
world, and continuing our well-be
ing, our good times here at home,"
Stevenson cracked off angrily at
what he charged was the "fright
ened attitude of the Republicans."
"We want Stevenson," rolled up
from the crowd like a wild wave
when Attorney General Pat Brown,
who introduced the candidate, sig
naled as the Governor was ap
proaching the rostrum.
And the tremendous call contin
ued for three minutes despite the
protests of the time-conscious tele
vision cameramen.
As Stevenson spoke, a wide smile
flashed across his face. Particularly
when he said, "... I don't believe,
as some say ,that I have talked over
anyone's head," and the audience
burst into "Noooo," and yelled,
"We're with you, Adlai."
"Never have so many said so
much so loudly—about so little,"

cans.
