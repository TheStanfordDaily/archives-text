# Clean Up Your Front Yard
## 
### 
Step a moment, picture your own home. You
would not care to have your front yard cluttered
with coffee cups, juice cans, and sandwich
wrappers.
The Cellar is Stanfords' front yard.
If you've ever told a stranger to meet you at
the Cellar you can imagine his reaction when
ho sees the cluttered area. After all, the Cellar
i.3 not a dumping ground. Red garbage cans
.re set up for that purpose. They're meant to
be used.
Seme of you may say, "There are two stu
dents and an attendant who are employed to
keep the Cellar clean." This is true. However,
these people have a large enough job to do,
without picking up papers that are carelessly

left on the table, on the benches, and on the
grass surrounding the Cellar Snack Bar.
At other campuses the problem of tidyness
around a snack bar has boen met. The Spartan
Grill at San Jose State utilizes the services of
all their students in keeping the campus spot
clean. And at Cal, a school, three times larger
than Stanford, every one co-operates in keeping
the snack bar grounds clean.
What can you do to help? The main thing
is to throw your coffee cups, and wrappers
away when you are finished. You can also re
mind your friends to pick up the refuse.
The Cellar coffee line is a campus institution.
It is an institution set by the students. Lets
keep that institution clean, â€”Huby Bernstein
