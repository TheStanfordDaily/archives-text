# BULL SESSION
## 
### SAM FRESHMAN 
The response to last week's Bull Session on the
Stanford women was both interesting and enlighten
ing. i' irst because I never thought that many people
read it.and second because reading the letters that
came in gave me something to do during my Tibetian
Basket Weaving seminar.
Vic Palmieri's restrained epistle was in very good
t.'l' te and I hereby apologize for misquoting him.

The editor informs me that they
haven't enjoyed reading anything
like his letter since he stopped
writing Bull Sessions. It is in
d<« I a shame that the authors
of the other clever little notes
Lent to me in the last week were
not able to restrain themselves in
a like manner.
Two freshmen women (who re
quested their names be withheld
from the public) turned in an

indignant report which seems to be based on per
sonal experiments these young coeds have conducted
on the Southern California campus. The result of

these experiments, according to their report, is that
by and large Stanford women are better (unfor
tunately it did not say lor what they are better).
Another who signs herself F. S. pleads for a more
tolerant attitude toward the opposite sex in which
I heartily concur. In fact as far as sex is concerned,
I am for it. F. S. also comments that if the Hull
Sessioner really looks like his photograph lie has
no right to write about women, probably never
having met one.
Agreeing that this problem requires the full time
study of an expert I am turning it over to Professor
Paul Wallin who has just received a grant of $3,550
from the Rockefeller Foundation to conduct research
on the matter. Speaking from experience 1 doubt
whether this sum will be adequate.

Another disaster has occurred near the Stanford
campus. Some loul vandal has removed several
"thinking" stools and the liquid refreshment spicket
from E. Rossotti's philosophical club. Please return it
soon as some of our best philosophers are undergoing
great hardships due to the loss.
