### BOB SEIZER UCLA Sports writer 
If it wore ever possible to pin them down, UCLA's coaching stall would
probably admit that they were more worried about the Homecoming
game with Stanford than any other team on the schedule.
Why? For one thing, Stanford has defensed the single-winging Bruins
better than any other team .since Red Sanders has been here. And al
though Bruins hold a 2-1 edge over the Indians since 1949, in both vic
tories it was the defensive efforts which meant the ball game.
HOMECOMING JINX
Besides worrying about Stanford, there's the Homecoming jinx which
is confronting the Bruins. In 25 games the Bruins have won but eight, and
only three times in the last 10 years. But there may be relief in sight,
lor UCLA has now won two in a row and both by 21-7 scores:.
Getting back to Stanford, the Bruin coaches feel that Stanford is the
most underrated team in the conference. Mo.st experts picked the Indian. 1
very low in the race since they lost quarterback Gary Kerkorian, Bill
McColl, Harry Hugasian, and 22 ether stalwarts from their champion.-hip
team.
But as pointed out by George Dickerson, who has scouted Stanford
for four years, they have as j.;oo(.l an all-around QB in Bob Garrett, a
much-improved Bob Mathias, and an outstanding defensive team.
Dickerson believes that Garrett is better than Kerkorian and says that
he has an excellent backfield to work with. Mathias of course is the big
offensive threat, being big, strong, and fast plus a year of valuable expe
rience, but Ron Cook and Skip Crist are more than adequate at halfbacks.
Many are counting the Indians out because they have started .slowly
this season. But that's exactly what they did last year when they won the
championship.
INDIANS WIN CLOSE ONES
But Stanford opponents shouldn't get excited about this. Last year
they beat inept Oregon in the opener by one TD, 27-20. They then edged
San Jo e State by 2(5-Ki, Michigan 2;)-13, and Santa Clara 21-14. The
Indians won six of their games by one touchdown (but they won 'em!)
and didn't beat a single team except Oregon State by more than two TD'S.
But last week the Indians came fast, and the Big Red Machine looks
like it is really rolling. The Bruins should provide the test this week.
Both squads are undefeated and the question on the lips of many locals
is who will come out on top and maintain an inside track to the FCC title.
