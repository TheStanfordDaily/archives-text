# Cal Strong in Statistics, Mathias 4th in Rushing
## 
### 
Stanford was again forced to take !
a back seat to Cal this week in Pa- i
cifie Coast Conference statistics, j
The Bear statistics included the j
three top rushers, the three scoring j
leaders, and the best rushing and i
total offense in the league.
In the individual rushing depart
ment, Bob Mathias was fourth, Bill
Rogers sixth, and Ron Cook sev
enth. Ma 111 i as has thus far aver
aged close to six yards per carry.
However, the PCC was led by
Johnny Olszewski, Don Johnson,
and Bill Powell of the Berkeley
team, with second - stringer Paul
Larson eighth.
J3cb Garrett was a poor second j
to Washington's Don Heiririch in the
passing department. Garrett has !
completed 28 passes to Heinrich's 61. j
Garrett's seven touchdown passes
far exceed the field, with Heinrich
and OSC'.s Jim With row second |
with four. T.'ie Husky star leads the ;
league in both passing and total
yardage with 718 yards in four |
games. Garrett is second in passing
with :177 yards.
Three Bears lead in the scoring
column. Olszewski, Larson, and
Johnson are trailed by Skip Crist,
Mathias, and Sam Morley, each o 1 j
whom have scored a trio of TD's.
In the pass receiving department, i
Ed Barker of Washington State, last i
year the nation's leading receiver, I
is fourth in the conference with only i
II completions. This is due to the;
fact that the Staters drew a last j
week, and have played one game j
less than the other schools.
In rushing defense, Stanford again
has to take a back seat to Cal. The j
Indians are fourth behind UCLA.
Idaho, and the Bears. Surprisingly
enough, the supposed iron defense
of USC trails Stanford, having
yielded a total of 100 more yards
so far this season.
After meeting such aerial powers |
as TCU and Northwestern, the Tro- I

jan power shows by the fact that
they still lead the league in pass
defense, having yielded an average
of only C 8 yards per game. Stanford
is fourth in total defense behind
USC, UCLA, and Cal.
In the rushing department, the
Indians are second to the Berkeley
team by 600 yards. Cal has thus far
rolled up 1,445 yards by rushing
alone in four games.
Due to their strong rushing per
formance last week and the at
tempting of only three passes, the
Indians trail in the passing offense
department. However, their tossing
percentage of .560 is tops. The
Bears are running away with the
total offense department, averaging
over 250 yards per game.
