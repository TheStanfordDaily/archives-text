TOKYOâ€”The United Nations ar
mistice delegation told the Commu
nists at Panmunjom today it still
was willing to resume talks when
the Reds present a "constructive"
I roposal and reminded them that
the talks were merely recessed, not
ended.
A letter written by chief UN ne
gotiator Lt. Gen. William K. Harri
son to North Korean Gen. Nam II
accused the Reds of using "half
truths, lies, and distortion of facts"
in an attempt to convince the world
the UN had broken off the truce
talks.
