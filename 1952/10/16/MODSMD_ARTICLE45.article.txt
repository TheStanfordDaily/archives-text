# Guide Tours Aid Campus Curious
## 
### BOB REZAK 
If you're curious about any
subject related to Stanford —
from earthquakes to endow
ments, Hoover to Harvard—you
don't need to write the Britan
nic a.
Chances are that the Student
Guide Service, currently under the
supervision of Alice Kwong, will be
able to answer your question.
The Service's staff of nine students
work in daily shifts throughout the
week to provide information about
the University and to conduct tours
of the campus. Their offices are lo
cated at the main entrance to the
Quad and in Hoover Library.
"We average, on busy days, as
many as 15 questions an hour,"
explained Irene Matthews of the
service staff.
Such questions, she said. range in
scope from locating students to pro
viding news about campus events.
To facilitate this work, Miss
Matthews pointed out, the staff
keeps at its finger tips a wide as
sortment of such miscellaneous
sources as catalogs, maps, pam
phlets, issues of the Daily, and
football schedules.
Questions asked most frequently
include those about Memorial
Church, Hoover Library (which
maintains its own separate branch
of the Guide Service) and campus
landmarks.
Since these questions must be
answered over and over again,
answers arc filed alphabetically in

a card file containing subjects
ranging in variety from the date
the campus was hit by the earth
quake (April 18, 1906) to "endow
ments for spiritualism," enroll
ment, and seating capacities of
various buildings.
Occasionally a staff member may
be "stumped" by a certain question
or request for information, Miss
Matthews said. In such cases, the
staff refers to the University director
and can, within a matter of minutes,
reach the proper source in person
by telephone.
Staff members conduct tours regu
larly on the campus for clubs, large
and small convention groups meet
ing in San Francisco, visitors from
foreign countries and from out of
stat?, and anyone else who is in
terested.
"Althmgh I've oniy had this job
for about a year," Miss Matthews
smiled, "I have learned more than
the average student ever knows
about Stanford."
"And," she said, "You'd be sur
prised at the number of students who
aren't familiar with the University.
We encourage these people to visit
our office for help."
Student Guide Service office hours
are from 10 a.m. to 12 noon and 1 p.m.
to 5 p.m. daily; 9 a.m. to 12 noon, and
1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturdays; and
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sundays.

besides conducting tours of the campus.

the campus was hit by the earth
quake (April 18, 1906) to "endow
ments for spiritualism," enroll
ment, and seating capacities of
various buildings.
Occasionally a staff member may
be "stumped" by a certain question
or request for information, Miss
Matthews said. In such cases, the
staff refers to the University director
and can, within a matter of minutes,
reach the proper source in person
by telephone.
Staff members conduct tours regu
larly on the campus for clubs, large
and small convention groups meet
ing in San Francisco, visitors from
foreign countries and from out of
stat?, and anyone else who is in
terested.
"Althmgh I've oniy had this job
for about a year," Miss Matthews
smiled, "I have learned more than
the average student ever knows
about Stanford."
"And," she said, "You'd be sur
prised at the number of students who
aren't familiar with the University.
We encourage these people to visit
our office for help."
Student Guide Service office hours
are from 10 a.m. to 12 noon and 1 p.m.
to 5 p.m. daily; 9 a.m. to 12 noon, and
1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturdays; and
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sundays.


QUESTION AND ANSWER DEPARTMENT—The multitude of
questions and answers that keep Stanford students and visitors
"in the know" are handled by the Student Guide and Informa
tion Service office, pictured above, located at the main entrance
to the Quad. A staff of nine keep the service running smoothly
besides conducting tours of the campus.

If you're curious about any
subject related to Stanford —
from earthquakes to endow
ments, Hoover to Harvard—you
don't need to write the Britan
nic a.
Chances are that the Student
Guide Service, currently under the
supervision of Alice Kwong, will be
able to answer your question.
The Service's staff of nine students
work in daily shifts throughout the
week to provide information about
the University and to conduct tours
of the campus. Their offices are lo
cated at the main entrance to the
Quad and in Hoover Library.
"We average, on busy days, as
many as 15 questions an hour,"
explained Irene Matthews of the
service staff.
Such questions, she said. range in
scope from locating students to pro
viding news about campus events.
To facilitate this work, Miss
Matthews pointed out, the staff
keeps at its finger tips a wide as
sortment of such miscellaneous
sources as catalogs, maps, pam
phlets, issues of the Daily, and
football schedules.
Questions asked most frequently
include those about Memorial
Church, Hoover Library (which
maintains its own separate branch
of the Guide Service) and campus
landmarks.
Since these questions must be
answered over and over again,
answers arc filed alphabetically in

a card file containing subjects
ranging in variety from the date
the campus was hit by the earth
quake (April 18, 1906) to "endow
ments for spiritualism," enroll
ment, and seating capacities of
various buildings.
