# YWCA Membership Drive
## 
### 
The annual membership drive of the Stanford YWCA begins

The campus organization, which is a member of the national
student and world YWCA, is only slightly younger than Stanford
University. It has the distinction of having pioneered the devcl-

opment of leadership among campus
women and in its policy of offering
a program to interest every woman
student.
The "Y" activities arc based on a
concern for the campus, the com
munity, the nation, and the world.
On the campus level, the pro
grams include foreign student ori
entation, freshman boy - girl rela
tion panels, marriage and the fam
ily discussions, student-faculty re
lations, and the annual student
workshop where representatives
from the various campus organiza
tions meet to find solutions to mu
tual problems.
The Stanford YWCA serves the
community through the "after
church coffee hours" which bring
campus and community worship
pers together following the services
at Memorial Church, through com
munity service projects, and
through the Strawberry Brunch
during Con Home Week. The "Y"
also assists on campus relief drives.

On the national and world level,

lic affairs discussion group which

designed to develop student think
ing on important political isssues.
