# Excom Fails To Split Reg Dance Profits
## 
### JIM MADISON Daily Associate Editor "54-40 or fight 
Excom fell short of this death
loss slogan last night, but tried
almost every other imaginable
division, ratio, or combination of
numbers in its efforts to deter
mine a fair split ol the Reg Dance
profits.
Derek Liecty, dance chairman and
Soccer Association representative,
had introduced a plea for a large
majority of the profits of the func
tion, which netted slightly over
$700, claiming that the Soccer Asso
ciation had done the major amount
of labor on the dance.
Alter Ralph Perlberger of the Polo
Association, which co-sponsored the
affair, had followed with a counter
report claiming a fifty percent share
in the proceeds, Excom took up the
matter of the actual disposition.
Attempts to make the split 25
1 percent for the Polo Association
] and 75 percent for the Soccer As
sociation, 40-f>o, and ;»o—7o were
all defeated by identical votes of
7 to 4.
Student manager Steve Horn in
troduced a compromise which pro
posed to allow the Polo Association
$340, or their needs as stated in
their original application to co-spon
sor the dance, and give the Soccer
Association the balance. Excom de
feated this motion by the same vote.
Nor was a final attempt to split
the proceeds 50-50 successful.
ASSU President Dick Weismann
cast the deciding vote to break a
5 to 5 tie and defeat this motion.
Finaly Excom was able to agree to
postpone action until its meeting next
week.
Explaining his action, Weismann
said that lie personally believed the
! Soccer Association is entitled to
more than half the profits, since
they seemed to have definitely ex
erted the majority of effort on (lie
basis of the cases presented,
j However, he led the move for post
ponement, declaring that he would
j meet next Monday with Liecty, Perl
i berger, and Bob McCreary, presi
i dent of the P"lo Association.
Excom also approved the consti
tution of the Stanford Sports Car
Club with the stipulation that (he
Club file with the ASSU office evi
dence that its various members
were adequately covered by insur
ance.
In other routine matters, the body
approved the appointment of Jack
Frazer, Chris Johnson, and Jeanne
Hickson to the Union Planning Com
mittee; and the appointment of Bob
i Rodolph to investigate the practi
cality and possibility of opening
j rooms in the History corner for
study.
