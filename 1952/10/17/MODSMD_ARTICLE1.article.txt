# HEALTHY INDIANS SEEK UCLA SCALP
## 
### PEIE GROTHE 
Willi everything lo gain and
just as much to Stanford's
resurgent Indians lock horns
with six-point favorite UCLA on
the floor of Los Angeles's smog
filled Coliseum tomorrow.
The largest migration sine; the
duck; flew to Central America lust
year is expected to see 3,000 to 4,000
Farm students-wander into the Col
iseum. The Coliseum will be a
pleasant setting for the Stanfordites

who fondly remember last year's
"greatest game of all time," the 27
to 20 USC triumph.
Stanford, which was expected to
[ go into the game in full, red
| cheeked health, has a few team
I members on the question-mark list.
One of them is soph sensation Matt
Armitage. Armitage just got out of
the Men's Rest Home after a bout
with the virus, and may be a little
weakened, Roy Krickeberg, how
ever, i a Class A replacement. John
Roberg, second - string offensive
guard, incurred an injured toe, and
may or may not make the trip

south.
However, the bvj guns are in
the full bloom of health and Tay
lor welcome i the return to action
of end Ron liadie, the best de
fensive end on the Coast, captain
and tackle Al Kirkland, halfs Skip
Crist and Have Eldredge, and
tackles John Broderick and John
Stanton.
More interesting to the Stan
fordites is the iniurv situation of
(lie powder - pnfT blue Bruins.
Tiny Ted Narleski, the hustle kid
from New Jersey, is definitely out

with torn rib muscles. Paul Cam
eron, the tailback who is supposed
to make the Bruins go, is sched
uled to start at left half, but it is
doubtful if his ankle will hold up.
Coach Red Sanders, who has all
the personality of a lead nail, has
said that Cameron is 70 per cent of
his offense. And so Cameron's health
is of vital concern to Stanford.
At the beginning of the season,
Cameron hurt his ankle, and it was
feared that he had a fracture. It
turned out to be only a ligament,
but Stanford trainer Connie Jarvis
said yesterday, "I've seen enough of

these caces to know that if what
you first think is a fracture turn:;
out to be a ligament, then it's a
pretty serious ligament injury.
That'll bother him for the rest of
the season. A person who needs to
cut and who needs power like Cam
eron is seriously handicapped when
he has an injury like that."
It appears, then, that a IGO-pound
soph named Frimo Villanueva will
shoulder most of the offensive bur
den. Although Villanueva is third
string left half, he is rated a sharp
passer and a good runner and is not

to be regarded lightly. However, he
does represent a drop in quality
from Cameron and Narleski.
Hon Stalwick, a very strong
runner, opens at right half, while
Cappy Smith holds down the full
back slot. The latter is a good
i unncr, a poor blocker.
One of the men to watch out
for is tow-headed Ernie Stockert,
a glue - lingered skyscraper end.
He and end Ike Jones have been
on the receiving end of many
UCLA single wing passes.
Many arc wondering whv the
powder-puff blue Bruins arc six

point favorites. Their defen >e is |
supposed to be nothing less than
sheer rock, but the Stanford de
fense has yielded only 3ti more
yards a game.
On the other side of the ledger,
the Indians have averaged 31(i.8
yards a game in olfense, whereas
the Uclans have only moved 108
yards a game.
However, UCLA does have the
best pass defense in the league, sta
tistically speaking, something that
will provide a challenge fur Bob
"The Arm" Garrett.

UCLA also has two sterling line
backer in Donn Moomaw and Ter
ry Debay, but Stanford scout re
ports have found two weaknesses in
the Brum front line. It's no secret
that they plan to make blowouts
out of punctures here.
Stanfoid starts the :*ame offensive
backtield whieh devastated Oregon
State last v/eek. The backs have
continued to run with that same
reckle s abandon in practice this
week and Garrett's arm has been
at iti> pinpoint best.
Oh, jcs, both teams are unde
feated.
