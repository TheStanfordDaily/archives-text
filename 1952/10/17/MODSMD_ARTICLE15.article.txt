# Coal Workers Quit

### 
PITTSBURGH â€” Wildcat strikes
spread through the nation's soft coal
fields today as 113,125 United Mine
Workers quit work in protest to the
Wage Stabilization Board's delay in
acting on a requested $1.90 a clay
pay increase.
There was strong feeling that the
wildcat walkouts would spread if
approval is not granted by Monday.
