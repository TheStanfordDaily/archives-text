CJ it y Councilman Robert V. Spi I -
lets who signed criminal com
plaints against them yesterday.

attempting to rip down a campaign
poster when he happened on them.

The arrest of the two youthful
Republicans apparently has stirred
a hornet's nest of reaction from both
Democrats and Republicans in San
Mateo county.
Democrats claim the Stanfordites
were part of a legion of Young
Republicans ordered to tear down
Taggart signs.
Roy I£. Seagraves, Democratic cen
tral committee member, reported
that during the past week more than
150 Democratic signs have been de
stroyed.
But Republican leaders quickly
denied the charge.
Karl Spencer, president of the
San Mateo Young Republicans (of
which the Stanford club is a part),
said last night, "Young Republicans
neither advocate nor encourage
any pel of political vandalism or
malicious mischief."'
He further stated, "Individual
youthful enthusiasm should not be
confused with the constructive, or
ganized activities of the San Mateo
Young Republicans."
The Stanfordites apprehended by
Spillers, however, deny association
in any drive to damage political
signs. They said their intention to
destroy the one sign near Five Points
was just a passing whim.
