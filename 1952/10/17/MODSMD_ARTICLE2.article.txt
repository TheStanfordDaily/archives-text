## 
### HADLEY ROFF Doily Political Editor 
Adlai Stevenson took a polite
poke at the framers of the
I.oyalty Oath when ho spoke at
the . University of California in
Berkeley yesterday morning.
The Democratic presidential can
didate told a throng of about 5,000
students "I know something of the
heroic struggle of the members of
the University in defense of aca
demic freedom—a true crusade by
those least martial men and women,
a company of scholars."
Ije said there are two chief threats
to freedom today—the Communists
and' those who fear freedom.
"The fundamental threat," he
asserted, "comes from the Com
munists and their allies for there
is no douht of their intentions."
"Out," lie added, his face frozen
into grim lines, "the threat of free
dom also comes from men who mis
trust freedom —from men who do
not understand the ideas which free
men venture and who do not see the
goals which free men seek."
The speech, 15 minutes in length,
was one of many delivered by the
Illinois governor and White House
hopeful yesterday as part of his

motorcade through central Califor
nia.
Wednesday night in San Fran
cisco. Stevenson healed California
Democrats to an old fashioned,
give 'em hell talk.
Yesterday, however, the governor's
tone was more subdued as he' pro
ceeded through the East Bay from
San Francisco and on to. Sacra
mento. From Sacramento he flew
to Los Angeles
In Sacramento, Steven: on dammed
the Republican farm policies, point
ing out that most Republican legis
lators voted against 90 percent sup
porters, controlled marketing agree
ments, and the Central Valley Proj
ect.
"To he blunt about it,"he said,
"Ihe Republican leaders this year
are spending most of their lime
trying In make people forget about
the Republican record in Con
| gross."
"I can understand this," he jibed,
"lliey could never get elected on that
record."
He then went on to lambast the
Republican presidential aspirant,
General Eisenhower.
"The General was trying to make
people forget the record the other
day in Fresno when be said that
he and the Republican party stand „

behind the present f)0 percent price
support law-—I wonder if the Gen
eral knew that just four months
ago, in June of this year, a ma
jority of the Republicans in the
House of Representatives voted
against !M) percent price supports?"
He added vehemently, "The Gen
eral, it seems to me, ought to
acquaint himself with facts like these
before he r.oes around making these
statements about where his party
stands and what it will do."
But it was at Berkeley, on tbc
quiet college campus, where the
crowd was most attentive.
Stevenson told the assemblage of
young people, "We do not fear ideas.
The good ones will enrich our lives.
The bad ones will perish."
"Nor do we fear the future," he
went on. "Here in this community
where young men and women
gather from every corner of the
free would, I want to aHirm my
conviction that we stand today
where youth has always sought In
stand. We stand on a threshold,
and life strctches wonderfully
ahead of ns. There have been
dark days in (he past. There may
be difficult ones ahead.
"But," he concluded, "life has not
brought us to the end of a blind
alloy."


COW PALACE GATHERING—23,OOO persons listened to Adlai Stevenson's listing of the Re
publican lineup two nights ago. Approximately 20,000 more were turned away.

Stevenson told the assemblage of
young people, "We do not fear ideas.
The good ones will enrich our lives.
The bad ones will perish."
"Nor do we fear the future," he
went on. "Here in this community
where young men and women
gather from every corner of the
free would, I want to aHirm my
conviction that we stand today
where youth has always sought In
stand. We stand on a threshold,
and life strctches wonderfully
ahead of ns. There have been
dark days in (he past. There may

"But," he concluded, "life has not

COW PALACE GATHERING—23,OOO persons listened to Adlai Stevenson's listing of the Re
publican lineup two nights ago. Approximately 20,000 more were turned away.
Adlai Stevenson took a polite
poke at the framers of the
I.oyalty Oath when ho spoke at
the . University of California in
Berkeley yesterday morning.
The Democratic presidential can
didate told a throng of about 5,000
students "I know something of the
heroic struggle of the members of
the University in defense of aca
demic freedom—a true crusade by
those least martial men and women,
a company of scholars."
Ije said there are two chief threats
to freedom today—the Communists
and' those who fear freedom.
"The fundamental threat," he
asserted, "comes from the Com
munists and their allies for there
is no douht of their intentions."
"Out," lie added, his face frozen
into grim lines, "the threat of free
dom also comes from men who mis
trust freedom —from men who do
not understand the ideas which free
men venture and who do not see the
goals which free men seek."
The speech, 15 minutes in length,
was one of many delivered by the
Illinois governor and White House
hopeful yesterday as part of his

motorcade through central Califor
nia.
Wednesday night in San Fran
cisco. Stevenson healed California
Democrats to an old fashioned,
give 'em hell talk.
Yesterday, however, the governor's
tone was more subdued as he' pro
ceeded through the East Bay from
San Francisco and on to. Sacra
mento. From Sacramento he flew
to Los Angeles
In Sacramento, Steven: on dammed
the Republican farm policies, point
ing out that most Republican legis
lators voted against 90 percent sup
porters, controlled marketing agree
ments, and the Central Valley Proj
ect.
"To he blunt about it,"he said,
"Ihe Republican leaders this year
are spending most of their lime
trying In make people forget about
the Republican record in Con
| gross."
"I can understand this," he jibed,
"lliey could never get elected on that
record."
He then went on to lambast the
Republican presidential aspirant,
General Eisenhower.
"The General was trying to make
people forget the record the other
day in Fresno when be said that
he and the Republican party stand „

behind the present f)0 percent price
support law-—I wonder if the Gen
eral knew that just four months
ago, in June of this year, a ma
jority of the Republicans in the
House of Representatives voted
against !M) percent price supports?"
He added vehemently, "The Gen
eral, it seems to me, ought to
acquaint himself with facts like these
before he r.oes around making these
statements about where his party
stands and what it will do."
But it was at Berkeley, on tbc
quiet college campus, where the
crowd was most attentive.
