I or instance, before ilie Stevenson rally, a

Lt ..use I want to see wliat it'is like to go to a
pclihr.il rally vdn re there aren't any knives cr

This was the good side: a gathering ol cheer
ful, secure people taking an enthusiastic in
terest in then government.
But there was a less ptelty aspect. The un
reasoning content of. much o! the program, loi
example. The ridiculous skits , , . portraying
one's own party as white, the opposition as
blael:, The even more ridiculous campaign
songs. And in spite of Stevenson's much pro
claimed appeal to the intellect, the Democrats
were just as guilty o! this type of thing as the
Republicans. An clfectivo social technique?
Granted. But a social necessity? Wo wonder.
IV«- .tiro had in the buck ot oui minds this
thought: here are ,-Al these people, showing
real mteie.J in theri government. But how
deep does it go? How many ol them will con
tinue to care, once the"I I.ike Ike" and 'Tor
ward with Stevenson'' buttons Lave been L- id
away and the Campai-jn speeches have
ceased?
Perhaps the people who censure their lead
e-rs so bitterly every election year would have
n little less lo complain about il thoy would
maintain the same interest, enthusiasm, and in
fluence in the less exciting in-between yeais
when the work of government continues
though the spotlights are turned off.
