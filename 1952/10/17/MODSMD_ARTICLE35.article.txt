NEW YORK, Orl .1(1 (UP) —
Ibis may l»e- the-big-year at last
for college football in the Far
West.
Humiliated, edged-out, and 'omc
times just plain licked in the Rose
Bowl every season since the end of
World War 11, the Pacific Coast
Conference seems to be bristlinj l
with power this time out and ready
ing a trap for the New Year's visitor
for the liig Ten.
California, Southern California,
UCLA, and Stanford are (lie hi,;
wheels of the moment. Far West
ern observers in town for the re
cent World Series, so often disil
lii ionetl liv Itose Bowl result-.,
cautiously pverfuted the Pacific
Coast re urgenee is nearly com
plete.
The elimination process gets un
der way this weekend when Stan

er. The survivor later will have to
cope with hard-running California
anil hard-tackling Southern Cali
fornia.
Early results indicate at least that
ihis is the Far We. t's best sca. on

ince before the war, and particu
.a:ly heartening to long-suffering
,ans out there should be die matter
il defense.
All the top four but Stanford have
ueen mighty stingy with opponents'
points and so far Stanford doesn't
exactly have to hang its head in
shame.
Intersoctionally, the Far West has
made some important stands al
ready even if no victories have
been scored yet over Midwesterners
of true IJo.se Bowl caliber.
California walloped Minnesota,
-ll# to l.'J; Stanford licked Michi
gan. II to 7; Sonlh rn California
clouted Northwestern, *!1 to 0. and
shut out Army, 21 to 0; UCLA
downed Texas Christian, M to 11,
anJ Kite, 20 to 0.
One of the major surprises was
Oregon State's gallant bid against
mighty Michigan State, before go

well creamed by UCLA, was unim
pressive in losing at Illinois, 48 to
11, and Washington State was beat
