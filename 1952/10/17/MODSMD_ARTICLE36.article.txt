## 
### DON STEPHENS 
Hoping to provide the impetus for
a varsity victory, the Stanford
frosh will enplane to Los Angeles
at ti tonight to battle with theii
lowly counterparts, the UCLA
frosh.
Frosh Coach Bob Ghilotti, follow
ing Chuck Taylor's weekly example
of predicting a victory for his team,
.elected his squad to walk off with
their first scalp of the season to
morrow in their preliminary con
test, starting at 10.30 a.m. in the
Memorial Coliseum.
Another aspect concerning the
two clubs, who are in their initial
contests of the year, is the "homi
ness" of the proceedings. Over half
of the starting offen ive Bruin align
ment was s luted to matriculate on
the Farm following the culmination
of their prep careers. Seems the
Ijoys hated to leave their stomping
grounds and elected to compete for
UCLA.
Emulating their varsity's single
wing offense, with a balanced line
and a winged backfield, the Bru
babes have two backs on the order
of Ted Narleski and Paul Cameron
in Boh Miller, 179, and Dick Her
man, 105. Both are speed merchants.
Aside from Miller and Herman,
who will handle most of the passing,
the Indian frosh are expected to
manage their "teammates" in fine
style.
Coach Ghilotti announced a de
fensive and offensive alignment,
with Nathan Leanse going both
ways at fullback and safety.
Normally a running team with
Bill Tarr, Jim Truher, and Leanse
spearheading the attack, Ghilotti
expects Jerry Gustafson to fill the
air with passes to keep the UCLA
defense "honest."
On defense, linebacker Bob Long,
who is the top varsity prospect in
the stop department, will call the
defensive set-ups.
