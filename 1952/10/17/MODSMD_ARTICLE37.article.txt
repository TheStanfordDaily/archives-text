### BEN HARRIS 
When undefeated Stanford and
equally uivoikd UCLA meet in the
Los Angeles Coliseum tomorrow af
ternoon, it will mark the twenty
second meeting of these traditional
grid foe;;.
(11 a series begun in 1025 when j
Glen S. Warner's Card eleven I
trampled the Lvuhis K2 to (I, Stan- |
ford lias triumphed I.'l times, lost
eight contests, and tied one. Down
through the years, (his series,
which is fast becoming a major
rivalry, has produced some never
to-be-forgotten thrillers.
Take that 1940 parne. Clark j
Shaughnessy's "Wow Boys," march- j

i ing toward an undefeated season
and a Rose Bowl victory over Ne
braska, barely nudged the light blue
20 to 14 in a titanic struggle. Norm
Standlee and Frankie Albert of the
present high-Hying San Francisco
I'Jers, Pete Kmetovic, and the pres
j ent Stanford coach, Chuck Taylor,
j vvere all standouts in that aggrega
tion.
Three years ago Red Sanders
brought an undefeated Bruin eleven
I trj Stanford Stadium to be complete
; ly outplayed and yet win 14 to 7. In
H). r )0, a highly favored Card eleven
I fell 21 to 7 before the running of,
| little Teddy Narleski, who vyd' he
I out of the UCLA lineup tomorrow

with injuries. All-American Donn
Moomaw, who will start for the
Bruins, was also instrumental in
that game as a stellar linebacker.
Ijtst fall, in :i crucial game
which kept Chuck Taylor's crew
Rose Howl hound, Gary Kerko
rian mixed his passes with some
great running by Mathius to
stop the Bruin 21 to 7.
Needless to say, tomorrow's game
should be equally exciting as any
of its predecessors. With each team
undefeated. Stanford hot for an
other PCC championship, UCLA
smelling roses, and Cal and South
ern C:d al::o undefeated, the lire
works should really be rare.
