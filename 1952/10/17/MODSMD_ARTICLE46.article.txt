Stanford 7-4—UCLA's offense has yet to put together a sustained drive
rhey wait for a break and then score. They must either yo with u
uippled Paul Cameron or an untried Primo Villanueva in their key tail
back slot. They have good blocking up the middle, but Cappy Smith isn't
i hard enough hitter to use it. Don Stalwick is always a threat with his
mss-catching and wide wing-back sweeps, a play that Stanford always
has trouble with. Stanford's offense is well balanced and last week finally
showed the ability to make the long gain. 'Ihey'll be meeting the toughest
pass defense and one of the roughest running defenses they'll face all year.

UCLA 7-4 —UCLA's great pass defense has nabbed 17 passes in four
games. UCLA coach Sanders calls the defense his first team. Moomaw
and Deßay are the toughest line-backers the Cards will buck all year.
Summing up, UCLA's lack of offensive punch and Stanford's rough
defense should combine to hold the Bruins to about one touchdown.
Stanford meanwhile will find the going tough trying to drive against the
Bruins, but they should pull a few long gains to win about 14-7 —M.IL

Stanford 7-4—UCLA's offense has yet to put together a sustained drive
rhey wait for a break and then score. They must either yo with u
uippled Paul Cameron or an untried Primo Villanueva in their key tail
back slot. They have good blocking up the middle, but Cappy Smith isn't
i hard enough hitter to use it. Don Stalwick is always a threat with his
mss-catching and wide wing-back sweeps, a play that Stanford always
has trouble with. Stanford's offense is well balanced and last week finally
showed the ability to make the long gain. 'Ihey'll be meeting the toughest
pass defense and one of the roughest running defenses they'll face all year.

UCLA 7-4 —UCLA's great pass defense has nabbed 17 passes in four
games. UCLA coach Sanders calls the defense his first team. Moomaw
and Deßay are the toughest line-backers the Cards will buck all year.
Summing up, UCLA's lack of offensive punch and Stanford's rough
defense should combine to hold the Bruins to about one touchdown.
Stanford meanwhile will find the going tough trying to drive against the
Bruins, but they should pull a few long gains to win about 14-7 —M.IL
