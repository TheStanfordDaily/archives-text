# Much-Discussed Lone Woman Rule Is on Trial Again
## 
### 
The "Lone Woman Rule" is again
on trial.
Student and administration repre
sentatives will meet Thursday night
to discuss the present status of the
rule, which is the portion of the
Women's Social Regulations forbid
ding a woman to enter a man's resi
dence unless accompanied by at
least one other woman.
Anyone who has an opinion on
the rule—whether it should be kept,
abandoned, or revised—is asked to
cal Tom Blount at Phi Kappa Sig
ma, Susie Reichert at Storey, or
Jeanne Bobis at Union.
The Thursday meeting will be the
first this year on the rule, which
was discussed in detail but not acted
upon last year.
