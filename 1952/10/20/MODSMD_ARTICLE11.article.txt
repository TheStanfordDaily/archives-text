# Excom Approves Banner Transfer
## 
### 
Jurisdiction over use of the street
banner in front of the ASSU Stu
dent Union has recently been trans
ferred from Cardinals to the Public
Relations Committee.
Excom, which approved the trans
fer of authority at its Oct. 15 meet
ing, has announced that the pro
cedure for obtaining use of the ban
ner for publicity purposes will re
main the same. Student organiza
tions desiring use of the banner are
requested to sign up in the ASSU
office at least a week in advance of
desired use.
Priority for use will be given to
Cardinals, with all-campus events
receiving second consideration.
