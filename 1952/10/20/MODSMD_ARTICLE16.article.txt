### 
TOKYO, Monday, Oct. 20 (UP)â€”
Gen. Mark W. Clark refused today
to resume the recessed armistice ne
gotiations at Panmunjom and re
jected last week's Communist note
as containing "nothing new or con
structive."
The United Nations commander,
in a long note to the Communist
commanders in North Korea, extin
guished any hope that peace in
Korea might be reached at Pen
munjom unless the Reds accept the
UN principle of "no forced repa
triation" of war prisoners.
