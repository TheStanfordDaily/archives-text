THE REMAINS—Tony Ratto, Stanford senior, gave no unusual
thought to a dump truck parked on the side of Stanford Avenue,
when he started to drive past it at 9:30 last night after turning off
El Camino. But the truck, belonging to L. W. Jensen Co., had a
low bed trailer attached to it which had no stoplight reflectors,
and this Ratto didn't see. As he started past, he sideswiped the
heavy trailer brutally tearing off his right-hand door. The force
of the collision ripped up the rest of his car and left it standing
astraddle the street perpendicular to the truck. Luckily Ratto
was unhurt, but if he had been carrying any passengers, there
might have been serious injuries.
