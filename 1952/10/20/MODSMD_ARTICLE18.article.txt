# 'MOUNTAIN OF WOOD'
## Frosh Start Work Today On Big Game Bonfire Construction 
### 
Freshmen today began construc
tion of the big gaiYie bonfire in the
bottom of Lake Lag.
Built each year by thy men of the
freshmen class, the bonfire is a tra
ditional part of the California-Stan
ford Big Game festivities. The
mountain of wood, expected to ex
ceed last year's height of 85 feet, is
scheduled to light up the dry bed
of Lake Lag Thursday night, Nov. 20,
two days before the annual battle
for the Axe.
This year's braze, according to
Bonfire Committee Chairman Chuck
Kashima, is a "tremendous project."
"At the present time," he adds, "our
main problem is not getting wood,
but finding transportation for it."
Chuck explains that although neigh
boring construction and wrecking
companies have promised enough
wood to keep the freshmen busy
hauling for several weeks, there is
a great shortage of trucks to carry
the lumber to Lake Lag.
"Two-and-a-nalf-ton trucks," he
stresses, "are the only practical
means of transportation, for (he
bonfire will comprise about 200
truckloads of wood." Large quan
tities of wood will also be needed
shortly, however, and anyone with
information regarding wood or
trucks is asked to contact the
ASSU office between Sand 12 a.m.
or the Encina office between 1 and
5 p.m. The number is DA 3-9411,
extensions 29X and 268 respectively.
Scheduled wood pickups begin
this afternoon from 3 to 6 with wing
5E on Encina. The 17 freshmen wings
of Encina, Stern, Toyon, and Stan
ford Village will rotate, a different

wing working each Monday after
noon through Friday afternoon and
Saturday morning. This will put
each frosh man to work about once j
every two weeks.
Some progress was made Friday
afternoon when Enema 2E organized
a pickup and collected several truck
loads of prospective bonfire. The site
of the fire has already been staked
out on the lake bed, and it is re
quested that all dumping be done
outside the pickets; raising the fire
85 feet, plus, requires systematic con
struction.
A construction chairman, in fact,
will be appointed to plan and super
vise the operation.
Committee members already ap
pointed by chairman Kashima arc:
Co-ordination, Gerry Kelly; Pub
licity, Pete Iloss and Jon Katzcn
bach; Lights, Rodney McDaniel;
and Refershments, Sue Ziegler and
Mari Ann Reeter. Refreshments
will consist of coffee and dough
nuts served by the Roble girls to
men working on the bonfire. The
decoration chairman as well as the
construction chairman is yet to be
appointed.
"It would be appreciated," says
Chuck, "if those who have had ex
tensive construction or decoration
experience, especially on previous
bonfires, would contact me." The
chairman's number is DA 3-7933.
An organization meeting of the
bonfire committee will be held to
morrow night at G:45 p.m. in the
Encina lounge.
