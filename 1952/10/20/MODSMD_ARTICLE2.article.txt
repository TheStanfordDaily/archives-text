# Voting Aids Urged
## 
### 
SPRINGFIELD, 111. â€”Gov. Adlai
E. Stevenson today asked Dwight D.
Eisenhower, his Presidential rival,
to join in an effort to see that every
eligible American has a chance to
vote on election day.
Stevenson said, "One of the great
est obstacles to voting is the fact
th?\t at least one person in nearly
family in America must work
all day."
"This not only means that the
worker cannot get to the polls until
after his working hours; it often
means that his wife cannot get to
the polls until he can get home to
take care of the children," he said.
As a result, he said, polls arc
often idle during day-time working
hours and then get so jammed in
the few remaining late hours that
many are left standing in line at
the closing hour.
"This difficulty could be largely
overcome if the businesses in every
community in the country made
some arrangement to permit their
employees to vote."
