# Hoover Adds to the Confusion
## 
### 
We have just finished reading former Presi
dent Herbert Hoover's speech entitled "The
Progressive Record of the Republican Party."
And we are confused.
The ex-President condemns the Democrats,
then goes ahead to claim that close to every
thing the Democrats have done in the past 20
yearb was originally done by the Republicans.
We take this to mean he thinks these things
are good.
We are confused, because we recall that
other Republicans have told us their party is
frankly and honestly conservative; that it op
poses the increase of federal power and sup
ports "decentralization." How does this fit in
with approval of the social advances made in
the last 20 years?

It seems to us that this is one more example
of the basic lack of agreement in the Republican
Parly. One side admits its conservatism; the
other grants that social progress is a fine and
beneficial thing, but that it can be better ad
ministrated by the Republican Parly.
The GOP should make up its mind.
Supposedly it did when it nominated Eisen
hower (the better administrator) over Taft (the
honest conservative). But the contradictions in
the current campaign make us wonder.
We believe an opposition party can regain
power on either of two platforms: (1) we'll give
you what you've got and give it to you better;
(2) we'll give you something different.
If the Republican Party expects to win in
November, it must stop trying to campaign on
both.—Dorothy Dodcje
