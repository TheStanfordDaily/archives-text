# Politics at Last Under Way
## 
### 
Well, we made it!
Those of us who have long regretted Stan
fords' political isolationism and who have long
worked to do something about it are cheered to
learn that a political debate will be held on
campus tonight.
The Federation of American Scientists have
stepped forward and become the first group to
make use of the privilege which the Board of
Trustees granted last spring: that of holding bi
partisan political discussions.
It is interesting to note that the first subject
of political debate is the very sane one "Would
the interests of science and its advancement be
best served by your candidates for the presi
dency and vice-presidency"—especially since
we remember so vividly the arguments last
spring that politics on campus would mean radi
cal partisan activity.
Many persons are still disatisfied with the
present situation. They feel — and we agree

with them—that during an election year stu
dents should have an opportunity to hear out
standing political speakers present ali sides cf
the issues at hand.
One reason why this has not been possible
is that the present setup provides that both
sides must be presented in the same program—
a virtual impossibility in a year when speakers'
schedules are close to inflexible. We hope be
fore another election year arrives, this ruling
will have been amended to provide balance
over a period of time, not in each individual
program.
But although we still have a long way to go,
we are at least making progress. The ivory
tower still stands but it shows some strong
signs of crumbling.
Attend the debate tonight, attend the dis
cussion the Debate Society has planned for
later this month. May we use of what you have
and if you aren't satisfied, keep working for
something more.
