# BULL SESSION

### DICK MANSFIELD 
Saturday, when almost everyone was in Los An-'"3j
geles and the campus was supposed to be deserted, 1
we who had stayed behind were puzzled to see a I
horde of little people scampering about the campus. I
These little people, it developed, were high school |
journalists from all over the Bay Area, and they were j
having the twenty-ninth annual convention of the j
Central California Scholastic Press Association. if
Sometime Saturday afternoon, displeased with the
entertainment on the radio, I called the Daily, being (
alter one W. Walter Menninger, who, but for the '
grace of Dorothy Dodge, runs the place. By chance
1 got Dorothy Dodge. "Alio," i said, "gimme Walt."!
"You must mean W. Walter Menninger," she Raid, s
"fie isn't in. But whoever you are, come on over to 1
the Nitery at 3:30. We're serving the high schoolers j
cider and doughnuts, and you can have a free j
doughnut." |
I leaped into my Saturday best and made for the .
Nitery. At the Nitery was Dorothy Dodge. There
were also many high school journalists, milling around
and making little angry sounds. But there were no
cider and doughnuts. "Going crazy I am," said
Dorothy. "Here are roughly a million malcontented, j
underfed high school journalists. They don't like it j
here. In my talk this morning I asked them if they
were all coming to Stanford and they laughed. And j
now no doughnuts. No cider." «
"Who is supposed to lie getting the cider and X
doughnuts?"
"Walt." I
So W. Walter Menninger bobbed back into the 1
picture. Seems that he and Constance Libhey (this $
column reads like the masthead) were downtown P
: a'cunging cider and doughnuts for the cider-bust, Jj
and were half an hour late already. Dorothy was y
frantic. Some ox lumbered up. "Say," he growled, «
"do we get food here?" "Yes," said Dorothy, "it's i
coming. But It's only for the high school kids."
"i'alo Alto High, "57," growled the giant, and moved J
off. "j
The Nitery was gradually filling up, and pome of (
the people were starting to leave. Unrest was growing. (

Factions in the north, said rumor, were rising. Then,
enter C. Libbey, bearing doughnuts. "It's been
awful," she said. Dorothy Dodge nodded. Walt
showed up with twelve jugs of cider, and then the
fun began.
Those who doubt Menninger's talents ought to roe
him making the Feats of Co-ordination with a cider
jug and paper cups. Especially when a high school
girl reporter is holding the latest paper cup. "Oh
(hee hee)," says the high school girl, "that's lots,
thanks," and jerks the cup away. Menninger, pour
ing cider on the floor, mouths a vile oath. The girl,
unnerved, drops the cup. More oaths and general
merriment.
Eventually the herd thundered nut, and we were
left with cleanup. Dorothy was still worried. "Now
they are going to the Shack," she said, "it» see how
a college daily works. But there is no one at the
Shack right now." Presently she left and hurried
hack to the Daily Shack to cope with the high
schoolers. After all the general effort, about a third
of everything was left, and Walt took the doughnuts
back downtown, while the cider went to the Daily
to be buried under the floor for a while.
Later on, out of a sense of morbid curiosity, I
dropped in on the Shack. Dorothy seemed to be
recovering nicely, but Hadley Roff was hunched over
the copy desk, weeping softly. He had come in just
before Dorothy got back and found the high school
set already there, admiring the photos on the assign
ment board. These j-hotos depict the wild activities
at the last Daily party, giving the lowdown on college
life, or Stanford Confidential. Pulling a: ide the
giggling girls, Roff found at the bottom of the heap
a high school faculty advisor, who was examining the
gem of the spread, a lurid thing at best. "Tell me,"
said the faculty advisor, "is life at Stanford always
like this?"
This reduced KoIT, and although the kiddies were
gone when 112 got there, the mark of their passage
was on the Shack, lladley, Dorothy, Walt, Connie,
and the Daily generally and will probably be there
until our next CCS PA convention.
