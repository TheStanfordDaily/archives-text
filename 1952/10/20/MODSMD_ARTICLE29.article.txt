To the Editor:
Today I had the opportunity to meet Ist Lieutenant
Pak Jung Hee, presently working with a civil as
sistance group in a front-line U.S. division, a former
company commander in the ROK army with a tine
combat record. In conversation with Lt. Pak. I dis
covered that he had attended Seoul University for
two years prior to 1950, majoring in political science.
Lt. P.ik wishes to complete his education in an Ameri
can university; however, that will have to wait for
some time. In the meantime I wish to solicit dona
tions of used texts for college courses in political
science, sociology, psychology, economics, history,
world literature, and philosophy. Lt Pak attempted

to register in a correspondence course at the Uni
versity of Chicago but the cost ($36.00) exceeded his
salary for six months!
llow about some assistance from the Stanford stu
dent body—those texts which Drs. Bark, Bailey,
Winters, Work, O'Mallcy, Whitaker, and others made
me pound several years ago will do double duty here
in Korea. Send them to:
