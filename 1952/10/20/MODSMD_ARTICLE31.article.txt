acquainted.
The "1" Club ipon.ors a weekly
discussion group called the Cosmo
politan Club. Each Friday afternoon
from 4 to 6, students gather in the
house at G22 Cabrillo Street for cof
fee, cookies, and chatter. The Co: mo
Club is not a real club at all; it is
merely an informal "bull-session."
The "members" include anyone who
wants to while away a half-hour or
just "shooting the hreezp "

The Co.mo Club was started just
last year with the idea that bctii
foreign and America.ll students
should have a place to gather for
coffee and casual talk.
The "1" Ciub also sponsors many
activities during International Week,
which comes lute in november and
