# Farm Historian Authors Book on Da Vinci's Works
## 
### 
Dr. Charles D. O'Malley, Stanford 1
history professor, is co-author of j
"Leonardo da Vinci on the Human I
Body," being published this week.
'1 he book, commemorating the '
five hundredth anniversary of Leo-I
nardo da Vinci's birth, contains his i
anatomical, physiological, and em- j
bryological drawings, and accom- j
panying text.
The text, sometimes explanatory, '
sometimes biographical an J anec- '
dotal, has been translated into Eng- j
iish by Drs. O'Malley and J. B. de C. j
M. Saunders of the University of
California.
Each plate is accompanied by ex- ;
planatory notes, an evaluation of the
individual plate, and an indication j
of its relationship to the work as j
a whole.
For the first time the drawings
have been arranged in chronological
order to display Leonardo's devel
opment as an anatomist.
In their biographical introduction,
the authors evaluate Leonardo's im
portant position in the historical de- I
velopnient of anatomical illustra- !
tions. His brilliance as a painter and ,
sculptor ha., tended to overshadow
his achievements in this field.
Dr. O'Malley is also director of j
the historical collection of the Lane I
Medical Library in San Francisco.
He is the author of several books on |
the history of medicine during the !
Renaissance.
