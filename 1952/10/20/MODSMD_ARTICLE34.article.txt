! 45 per cent; keep sororities as they
I are —23 per cent; abolish sororities
j completely 17 per cent; de-empha
! size sororities gradually — 15 per
j cent.
Figures indicated that sororities
promote it activities, demoted stud-

cent of the sorority members felt
that pledging is not worth the time
I it consumes.

i conclusively, it does indicate a cer
