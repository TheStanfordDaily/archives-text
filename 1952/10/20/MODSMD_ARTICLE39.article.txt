# Stanford Best Bruin Foe This Year Says Sanders
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
"The Indians are the best team we have mat so far this year
and we only wish we could be able to that two weeks from
now."
So spoke Henry "Red" Sanders, coach of the triumphant Bruins.
Ho and his team had remembered before the game that Stanford

\ jave them their only conference dc- ♦
Ileal in 1951.
Tno reason that Sanders men->
tionL'd the following two weeks i.~ i
: the fact that in successive games
i Ihcy lace Wisconsin and California, j
Heal u said he believeJ that two i
things gave tiie Card . their lirst de
i l'eat —bruin defense and P:.ul Cain- i
J eron.
"I was imperially pleased with
t tir defensive work," Zanders
said. "In fact, I believe our de
fensive squad i-> so good that not i
a single player from la .t year's j
team would be able to make first
! string today."' He termed their
| pass defense "spotty — sometimes
1 outstanding and at other times
impotent."
; "I won't say we wouldn't have
I won today without Paul Cameron,
but brother, it sure would have
[ been a lot closer. However, he was
! not up to par in his passing today ;
! (in 21 attempts, lit* completed only j
i seven)."
Comparing the Indians with :
Rice, TCU, and last year's Ro*e j
Bowl team, Sanders called the j
Cards much better balanced. He
I especially praised the play of
! Gai.etl and Morley, saying that
; from what he had ieeii Morley j
''compared quite favorably" with
Bill McColl. £»Ob Mathias, in his
estimation, "is a much-improved I
ball player."
Stanford's first touchdown, scored i
! oil a deflected pass, was called "a
I horrible break" by the Bruin coach, i
j ''YVc weren't particularly surprised I
by them today, though. We knew
! that they would • be a powerful, !
1 well-balanced team."
| Reviewing the game strategy, I

l Sanders' said he thought Taylor
was correct in a fourth - «*»»wii
Mriiniiiage* play with one minute
to play in the half. However, the
play not work, the Brufris
j took over anil f.corod junt under
the KUn.
