# Cameron Runs Wild As Bruins Win, 24-14
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
LOS ANGELES COLISEUM, Oct. 18 —A good thing cams to a
bad end today.
Stanford reached UCLA for more points than the Bruins had
allowed their other four opponents combined, but it wasn't enough
to stop Paul Cameron. For the record, UCLA won, 24 to 14.
Like the girl with the curl, when Stanford was good, it was very,

very good, and when it was bad, it
was very, very bad.
One of the factors contributing to
the Indians' looking bad was the
passing and running of Cameron, by
far the best back Stanford has met
all year. Vic Kelley, the UCLA
athletic news publicist, said after the
game, "If we didn't have Cameron,
Stanford would have beaten us by
two touchdowns today."
But the brutal truth is that the
powder pufT blue Bruins did have
Cameron, that the same Cameron
threw touchdown passes, and that
he averaged ti.fi yards a carry on
10 forays at the line.
Just as Cameron hurt the Indians
from a personal point of view, the
optional pass-run play hurt the kids
from the Farm from a tactical point
of view.
As Chuck Taylor said after the
game, ''The optional pass-run play
is the most dangerous in football."
When the defensive ends floated to
cover the pass receivers, Cameron
would run the ball right down Stan
ford's throat. When the ends rushed
directly in, blockers would do the
work, and Cameron would run out
side. When the ends played wide,
Cameron would run inside of them.
If Taylor would have ordered the
linebackers to zoom in and assist the
ends, then Stanford would have been
wide open for Bruin passes.
Whichever way the Indians turned,
they were up a tree.
A formation that hurt the Cards
was the double flanker formation.
Red Sanders' men had only used the
play six times in the last two games,
and then to pass from. Against Stan
ford, the Bruins ran from it, and it
caught the Indians by surprise.
Although the Uclans tacked up
10 more points on the scoreboard,
they only outgained the Cards by
four yards, 316 to 312. They gained
190 yards on the ground, compared
to Stanford's -)*, and 124 through
the airlanes, compared to the In
dians' 176.
Stanford had its bright points
this afternoon, hut for one interval
of SO yards they looked positively
unbeatable. The score was UCLA
24, Stanford 7, and someone lit a
firecracker under the Indian pos
terior.
Bob Garrett faded back from the
20, spotted his favorite receiver,
Sambo Morley near the left side
lines, and whipped him a 30 yard
aerial. Boom, like that. Next, it was
Skippy Crist, the 208 pound boomer
from Palo Alto, gobbling up 1!) yards
in one lightening thrust.
UCLA was offside, and the ball
was moved to the 25. Then, it was
Ron Cook galloping for 11 and Bob
Mathias, playing the best game of
his career, powering through Donn
Moomaw and two other tacklers for
six yards. Crist gained three at left
guard, and Mathias churned for three
more. Three plays later, Mathias
took advantage of a Phil Wilson
block and zipped into the end zone.
It wps Stanford's most workman
like drive of the year. And it came
right after the Axe yell.
Stanford drew first blood in the
first quarter on a new Indian play,
one which Chuck Taylor insists he
had nothing to do with. From the
Stanford 38, Garrett spotted John
"Preying Mantis" Steinberg far
downfield. He heaved the ball and
it bounced ofT the loose-limbed end's
fingertips. But, lo and behold, here
was Bill Rogers 10 yards farther on

the Ho gobbling in the Steinberg
relayed pass and scooting the rest of
the way to the end zone. Seven to 0.
The Stanford lead was short lived
as UCLA roared back and tallied on
a 43 yard pass from Cameron to
Jones.
On the ensuing kickoff. Mathias
grabbed the ball on the four and
wing-footed 55 yards before he
was hauled down. It looked like a
repetition of last year's 98 yard run
against Southern Cal, and it al
most was. The last man stopped
Mathias.
The Bruins made it 14 to 7 mid
v.'nv in the second period as a Came
ron lo Ike Jones capped a 45 yard
drive. With less than a second re
maining in the lirst half, Cameron
hurled an eight-yard scoring pass to
Don Stalwick in the end zone. Half
Pete Dailey added a field goal to the
Bruin cause, booting it from the 17.
Coach Chuck Taylor was sur
prisingly cheery after the game and
commented, "This game was really
good l'or us. I feel no pain . . .
we'll be much better all season for
what we learned today. 1 liked the
way the kids stuck in there. This
year's outfit is every bit as good as
last year's. 1 told that to the boys
after the game today, and I meant
every word of it."
The Farm routers had one big
consolation in defeat. The Frosh
team wiped the Brubabes oft' the
turf, 42 to 0.
Whom do the Indians meet next
week? Oh, just Washington, who
beat Oregon 49 to U today.

LOS ANGELES COLISEUM, Oct. 18 —A good thing cams to a
bad end today.
Stanford reached UCLA for more points than the Bruins had
allowed their other four opponents combined, but it wasn't enough
to stop Paul Cameron. For the record, UCLA won, 24 to 14.
Like the girl with the curl, when Stanford was good, it was very,

very good, and when it was bad, it
was very, very bad.
One of the factors contributing to
the Indians' looking bad was the
passing and running of Cameron, by
far the best back Stanford has met
all year. Vic Kelley, the UCLA
athletic news publicist, said after the
game, "If we didn't have Cameron,
Stanford would have beaten us by
two touchdowns today."
But the brutal truth is that the
powder pufT blue Bruins did have
Cameron, that the same Cameron
threw touchdown passes, and that
he averaged ti.fi yards a carry on
10 forays at the line.
Just as Cameron hurt the Indians
from a personal point of view, the
optional pass-run play hurt the kids
from the Farm from a tactical point
of view.
As Chuck Taylor said after the
game, ''The optional pass-run play
is the most dangerous in football."
When the defensive ends floated to
cover the pass receivers, Cameron
would run the ball right down Stan
ford's throat. When the ends rushed
directly in, blockers would do the
work, and Cameron would run out
side. When the ends played wide,
Cameron would run inside of them.
If Taylor would have ordered the
linebackers to zoom in and assist the
ends, then Stanford would have been
wide open for Bruin passes.
Whichever way the Indians turned,
they were up a tree.
A formation that hurt the Cards
was the double flanker formation.
Red Sanders' men had only used the
play six times in the last two games,
and then to pass from. Against Stan
ford, the Bruins ran from it, and it
caught the Indians by surprise.
Although the Uclans tacked up
10 more points on the scoreboard,
they only outgained the Cards by
four yards, 316 to 312. They gained
190 yards on the ground, compared
to Stanford's -)*, and 124 through
the airlanes, compared to the In
dians' 176.
Stanford had its bright points
this afternoon, hut for one interval
of SO yards they looked positively
unbeatable. The score was UCLA
24, Stanford 7, and someone lit a
firecracker under the Indian pos
terior.
Bob Garrett faded back from the
20, spotted his favorite receiver,
Sambo Morley near the left side
lines, and whipped him a 30 yard
aerial. Boom, like that. Next, it was
Skippy Crist, the 208 pound boomer
from Palo Alto, gobbling up 1!) yards
in one lightening thrust.
UCLA was offside, and the ball
was moved to the 25. Then, it was
Ron Cook galloping for 11 and Bob
Mathias, playing the best game of
his career, powering through Donn
Moomaw and two other tacklers for
six yards. Crist gained three at left
guard, and Mathias churned for three
more. Three plays later, Mathias
took advantage of a Phil Wilson
block and zipped into the end zone.
It wps Stanford's most workman
like drive of the year. And it came
right after the Axe yell.
Stanford drew first blood in the
first quarter on a new Indian play,
one which Chuck Taylor insists he
had nothing to do with. From the
Stanford 38, Garrett spotted John
"Preying Mantis" Steinberg far
downfield. He heaved the ball and
it bounced ofT the loose-limbed end's
fingertips. But, lo and behold, here
was Bill Rogers 10 yards farther on

the Ho gobbling in the Steinberg
relayed pass and scooting the rest of
the way to the end zone. Seven to 0.
The Stanford lead was short lived
as UCLA roared back and tallied on
a 43 yard pass from Cameron to
Jones.
On the ensuing kickoff. Mathias
grabbed the ball on the four and
wing-footed 55 yards before he
was hauled down. It looked like a
repetition of last year's 98 yard run
against Southern Cal, and it al
most was. The last man stopped
Mathias.

lines, and whipped him a 30 yard
aerial. Boom, like that. Next, it was
Skippy Crist, the 208 pound boomer
from Palo Alto, gobbling up 1!) yards
in one lightening thrust.
UCLA was offside, and the ball
was moved to the 25. Then, it was
Ron Cook galloping for 11 and Bob
Mathias, playing the best game of
his career, powering through Donn
Moomaw and two other tacklers for
six yards. Crist gained three at left
guard, and Mathias churned for three
more. Three plays later, Mathias
took advantage of a Phil Wilson
block and zipped into the end zone.
It wps Stanford's most workman
like drive of the year. And it came
right after the Axe yell.
Stanford drew first blood in the
first quarter on a new Indian play,
one which Chuck Taylor insists he
had nothing to do with. From the
Stanford 38, Garrett spotted John
"Preying Mantis" Steinberg far
downfield. He heaved the ball and
it bounced ofT the loose-limbed end's
fingertips. But, lo and behold, here
was Bill Rogers 10 yards farther on

the way to the end zone. Seven to 0.
The Stanford lead was short lived
as UCLA roared back and tallied on
a 43 yard pass from Cameron to
Jones.
On the ensuing kickoff. Mathias
grabbed the ball on the four and
wing-footed 55 yards before he
was hauled down. It looked like a
repetition of last year's 98 yard run
against Southern Cal, and it al
most was. The last man stopped
Mathias.
The Bruins made it 14 to 7 mid
v.'nv in the second period as a Came
ron lo Ike Jones capped a 45 yard
drive. With less than a second re
maining in the lirst half, Cameron
hurled an eight-yard scoring pass to
Don Stalwick in the end zone. Half
Pete Dailey added a field goal to the
Bruin cause, booting it from the 17.
Coach Chuck Taylor was sur
prisingly cheery after the game and
commented, "This game was really
good l'or us. I feel no pain . . .
we'll be much better all season for
what we learned today. 1 liked the
way the kids stuck in there. This
year's outfit is every bit as good as
last year's. 1 told that to the boys
after the game today, and I meant
every word of it."
The Farm routers had one big
consolation in defeat. The Frosh
team wiped the Brubabes oft' the
turf, 42 to 0.
Whom do the Indians meet next
week? Oh, just Washington, who
beat Oregon 49 to U today.

LOS ANGELES COLISEUM, Oct. 18 —A good thing cams to a
bad end today.
Stanford reached UCLA for more points than the Bruins had
allowed their other four opponents combined, but it wasn't enough
to stop Paul Cameron. For the record, UCLA won, 24 to 14.
Like the girl with the curl, when Stanford was good, it was very,

very good, and when it was bad, it
was very, very bad.
One of the factors contributing to
the Indians' looking bad was the
passing and running of Cameron, by
far the best back Stanford has met
all year. Vic Kelley, the UCLA
athletic news publicist, said after the
game, "If we didn't have Cameron,
Stanford would have beaten us by
two touchdowns today."
But the brutal truth is that the
powder pufT blue Bruins did have
Cameron, that the same Cameron
threw touchdown passes, and that
he averaged ti.fi yards a carry on
10 forays at the line.
Just as Cameron hurt the Indians
from a personal point of view, the
optional pass-run play hurt the kids
from the Farm from a tactical point
of view.
As Chuck Taylor said after the
game, ''The optional pass-run play
is the most dangerous in football."
When the defensive ends floated to
cover the pass receivers, Cameron
would run the ball right down Stan
ford's throat. When the ends rushed
directly in, blockers would do the
work, and Cameron would run out
side. When the ends played wide,
Cameron would run inside of them.
If Taylor would have ordered the
linebackers to zoom in and assist the
ends, then Stanford would have been
wide open for Bruin passes.
Whichever way the Indians turned,
they were up a tree.
A formation that hurt the Cards
was the double flanker formation.
Red Sanders' men had only used the
play six times in the last two games,
and then to pass from. Against Stan
ford, the Bruins ran from it, and it
caught the Indians by surprise.
Although the Uclans tacked up
10 more points on the scoreboard,
they only outgained the Cards by
four yards, 316 to 312. They gained
190 yards on the ground, compared
to Stanford's -)*, and 124 through
the airlanes, compared to the In
dians' 176.
Stanford had its bright points
this afternoon, hut for one interval
of SO yards they looked positively
unbeatable. The score was UCLA
24, Stanford 7, and someone lit a
firecracker under the Indian pos
terior.
Bob Garrett faded back from the
20, spotted his favorite receiver,
Sambo Morley near the left side
lines, and whipped him a 30 yard

took advantage of a Phil Wilson
block and zipped into the end zone.
It wps Stanford's most workman
like drive of the year. And it came
right after the Axe yell.
Stanford drew first blood in the
first quarter on a new Indian play,
one which Chuck Taylor insists he
had nothing to do with. From the
Stanford 38, Garrett spotted John
"Preying Mantis" Steinberg far
downfield. He heaved the ball and
it bounced ofT the loose-limbed end's
fingertips. But, lo and behold, here
was Bill Rogers 10 yards farther on

The Stanford lead was short lived

repetition of last year's 98 yard run
against Southern Cal, and it al
most was. The last man stopped
Mathias.

hurled an eight-yard scoring pass to

Bruin cause, booting it from the 17.
Coach Chuck Taylor was sur
prisingly cheery after the game and
commented, "This game was really
good l'or us. I feel no pain . . .
we'll be much better all season for
what we learned today. 1 liked the
way the kids stuck in there. This
year's outfit is every bit as good as
last year's. 1 told that to the boys
after the game today, and I meant
every word of it."
The Farm routers had one big
consolation in defeat. The Frosh
team wiped the Brubabes oft' the
turf, 42 to 0.
Whom do the Indians meet next
week? Oh, just Washington, who
beat Oregon 49 to U today.

LOS ANGELES COLISEUM, Oct. 18 —A good thing cams to a
bad end today.
Stanford reached UCLA for more points than the Bruins had
allowed their other four opponents combined, but it wasn't enough
to stop Paul Cameron. For the record, UCLA won, 24 to 14.
Like the girl with the curl, when Stanford was good, it was very,

very good, and when it was bad, it
was very, very bad.
One of the factors contributing to
the Indians' looking bad was the
passing and running of Cameron, by
far the best back Stanford has met
all year. Vic Kelley, the UCLA
athletic news publicist, said after the
game, "If we didn't have Cameron,
Stanford would have beaten us by
two touchdowns today."
But the brutal truth is that the
powder pufT blue Bruins did have
Cameron, that the same Cameron
threw touchdown passes, and that
he averaged ti.fi yards a carry on
10 forays at the line.
Just as Cameron hurt the Indians
from a personal point of view, the
optional pass-run play hurt the kids
from the Farm from a tactical point
of view.
As Chuck Taylor said after the
game, ''The optional pass-run play
is the most dangerous in football."
When the defensive ends floated to
cover the pass receivers, Cameron
would run the ball right down Stan
ford's throat. When the ends rushed
directly in, blockers would do the
work, and Cameron would run out
side. When the ends played wide,
Cameron would run inside of them.
If Taylor would have ordered the
linebackers to zoom in and assist the
ends, then Stanford would have been
wide open for Bruin passes.
Whichever way the Indians turned,
they were up a tree.
A formation that hurt the Cards
was the double flanker formation.
Red Sanders' men had only used the
play six times in the last two games,
and then to pass from. Against Stan
ford, the Bruins ran from it, and it
caught the Indians by surprise.
Although the Uclans tacked up
10 more points on the scoreboard,
they only outgained the Cards by
four yards, 316 to 312. They gained
190 yards on the ground, compared
to Stanford's -)*, and 124 through
the airlanes, compared to the In
dians' 176.
Stanford had its bright points
this afternoon, hut for one interval
of SO yards they looked positively
unbeatable. The score was UCLA
24, Stanford 7, and someone lit a
firecracker under the Indian pos
terior.
Bob Garrett faded back from the
20, spotted his favorite receiver,
Sambo Morley near the left side
lines, and whipped him a 30 yard
aerial. Boom, like that. Next, it was
Skippy Crist, the 208 pound boomer
from Palo Alto, gobbling up 1!) yards
in one lightening thrust.
UCLA was offside, and the ball
was moved to the 25. Then, it was
Ron Cook galloping for 11 and Bob
Mathias, playing the best game of
his career, powering through Donn
Moomaw and two other tacklers for
six yards. Crist gained three at left
guard, and Mathias churned for three
more. Three plays later, Mathias
took advantage of a Phil Wilson
block and zipped into the end zone.
It wps Stanford's most workman
like drive of the year. And it came
right after the Axe yell.
