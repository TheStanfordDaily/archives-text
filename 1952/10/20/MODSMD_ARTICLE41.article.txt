## It's Better This Way 
### 
This morning we u;c an eraser again. We used one last year v. lu nwe
i picked Stanford over California. 11 there were no mistakes there would he j
1 no erasers. We made a mistake in picking Stanford over UCLA. We un
| derestimated the defensive ability of the Bruin*. And we never realized
! that one individual, namely Paul Cameron, could mean the difference in
*; this day of platoon football.
However in retrospect or perhaps we should say in rationalization we
are nut terribly disheartened by the Stanford 10-,*. In fait we feel that it
is a pretty good tiling- Sure it's great to win, espctyally when you go so
far to play, and its stub a long way bark to Palo Alto when you lose.
We must go along with Chuck Taylor when he says "This game was
rerdly good for us. 1 feel no pains. We'll be much better all season, because
, ' cf the things that we learned today."
The pressure is off Stanford. The Cards are not going to go undefeated,
they are not going to retain the Pacific Coast Conference crown.
Hut the Cards are going to be very tough to beat. They were lough
J to beat Saturday. Stanford has done reniarkablv well and a lot better
thy i anyone thought they would already. Chuck Taylor and his start
have done a superb job. The Indians on a particular Saturday could
whip any squad in the nation. Don't by any means count the IJSC and
Cal Raines as losses: l>ut don't say we picked the Indians to win. Our '
supply of erasers is wearing down.
If this entire football madness was left to us and we were coach- ;
ing the Bi;j Red our thought might be to start pointing for the Bi • Came
I I'ijjht now. Of course this can't be done. Washington, San Jose, USC and '
| Ore-won are all on tap; but we would settle for four straight losses, and
| a Big Came win to end up with a season record of five wins, five losses, j
We can t help but feeling that an occasional loss does wonders for the |
' spirit of the student body. Ppi some reason, a consistently winning ball j
: club does not get the backing that a loser does. For instance the 19-17 club
i which failed to win in nine games had more spirit generated behind it;
than another Failn team ever has. 'fhe rally attendance of last Wednesday
| night was a disgrace. Cubberley Auditorium was only half filled, and half
i tho_.e there were for the OSC game movies, not the rally.
We just have to look at our Berkeley neighbors to make our point. '
The California rooting section was half empty when the Bears played
, Santa Clara Saturday. The card stunts were ragged at half time because
! the bottom ol the men's rooting section was ;o bare that no one was there
to handle the cards.
California football is monotonous. Win. win and win again. Waldorf
coached mechanical teams are monotony in motion. California' rooters ]
should be bored. It is no wonder that they cut out on games that lack
luster. Cal rooters miss the thrill of being underdogs and winning. They !
miss the dissapptf.itinent of being favored and losing. Constant winning I
is not good for spirit. Student interest lags, gate receipts fall because j
the game is so often no contest, and when by some quirk a loss is in
dicted no one knows what to make of it, and excuses and "ifV till the air.
No, we like our way better. Our way where most games are a toss up,
where a win means something, and an occasional loss is expected and
; takes the pressure off.
Prom week to week we don't know who will win, our head is doubt
j ful, our pocket book says don t bet. but our heart cries out "Stanford will
, win. Perhaps that is why we must on rare occasions take up an eraser.

However in retrospect or perhaps we should say in rationalization we

is a pretty good tiling- Sure it's great to win, espctyally when you go so
far to play, and its stub a long way bark to Palo Alto when you lose.

thy i anyone thought they would already. Chuck Taylor and his start
have done a superb job. The Indians on a particular Saturday could
whip any squad in the nation. Don't by any means count the IJSC and
