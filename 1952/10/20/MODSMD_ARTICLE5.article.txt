### 
Alfred E. Driscoll, Governor of
New Jersey and supporter of Presi
dential candidate Dwight Eisenhow
er, attacked Democratic "double
talking on civil rights" at a box
lunch rally in Belmor.t yesterday.
The Governor accused Democratic
candidates Adlai Stevenson and
John Sparkman of using "the same
brand of political hypocrisy which
has been Truman's stock in trade."
"The cause of equality of oppor
tunity and treatment for all can
only be advanced when political hy
pocrisy is erased from the American
scene and those whom we place in
authority ere dedicated to the
preservation and advancement of
human dignity and the building of
a society which will enlarge the in
dividual rights and opportunities of
all people," he said.
Driscoll placed particular empha
sis on the voting record of Vice-
Presidential candidate John Spark
man, stating, "On 23 separate occa
sions he voted against advancing
the cause of human relations."
"We are proud of the fact that
Republicans have assumed a posi
tion of leadership among the states
by their .unwillingness to permit
abuses of fundamental guarantees
of intividual liberty to go unchal
lenged," he added.
The rally, sponsored by the Re
publican Assembly and the San Ma
teo County Council of Republican
Women, marked the first speech of a
nationally known campaign figure
on the Peninsula.
