# School Social Schemers Spark Stanford Spirit

### BOB REZAK 
"It's nol how hard the work is, it's just that it's time-consuming."
That's the way Roy Alexander, energetic president of Cardinals,
modestly describes the duties he and his egually energetic team
of cohorts perform in helping to keep alive the Stanford spirit.
Some 16 years ago when Big Game Week, Back to the Farm

Week, and other student activities,
now firmly a part of the colorful
Farm traditions, were capturing
student attention as they are today,
Cardinals came into being.
Conceived and organized largely
through the efforts of Stan Beau
baire, then editor of The Stanford
Daily, Cardinals replaced the old
Activities Council and vigorously
assumed its duties of maintaining a
full campus activity program.
Since those early days, Cardi
nals' duties have expanded and
enlarged, into what Alexander
terms a "two-fold program."
The Hrst phase, he said, is to
plan all campus activities for stu
dents and guests of the Univer
sity.
"The second phase of our pro
gram," he added, "i-; a flexible one
which has to do with planning for
gaps in the social calendar, espe
cially the long periods when there
are no campus events scheduled."
"It's a fairly complete, large pro
gram," the Cardinals president said
as he thumbed through a black
notebook crammed with dates and
appointments.
Such a program, he continued,
requires the concerted efforts of ten
other students, five juniors and five
seniors, who are appointed for a

one-year duration.
In addition, four permanent mem
bers who hold official campus offices
serve in the organization. These in
clude the ASSU vice-president,'stu
dent manager, managing editor of
The Daily, and president of the Ral
ly Committee.
Prospective members of Cardi
nals are selected by the older
members on the basis of scores
attained on rating cards which in
dicate past experiences in han
dling different types of activities.
Finally, members are approved by
Excom, to whom they are directly
responsible.
Each of the ten regular member?:
is assigned a specific activity and
carries out his work independently
---work which includes planning
budgets and enlisting the aid of
other campus organizations and stu
dents.
"My job," the Cardinals presi
dent continued, "is to see that
they are doing their job and fol
lowing it up."
Cardinals' regular meetings are
held on Tuesdays at 7:15 p.m. in the
Excom meeting room. The meetings
are open for those who have busi
ness to conduct before the group or
problems the group may be able

to handle.
Once the success of a major ac
tivity is assured, Alexander said,
Cardinals relinquishes its hold on
it and turns that activity over to
committees on campus with inde
pendent status. Charity drives, for
example, formerly a Cardinals
function, are now handled by
other organizations.
However, this doesn't mean Car
dinals' duties arc lessened, for as
Alexander explains:
"Cardinals is an organization that
is thinking and planning ahead for
new ideas and new events to spon
sor."
