# Big Political Debate Is Set Tonight
## 
### 
The first Stanford political de
bate will be held tonight at 8 in
the Bowman Alumni House. "Would
the interests of science and its ad
vancement be best served by your
candidates for the Presidency and
Vice-Presidency?" will be the topic
of the series opener sponsored by
the Federation of American Scien
tists.
James Kessler, representative of
Citizens for Eisenhower, and Ed
ward Scoyen, a San Francisco at
torney from the Stevenson-Spark
man Club, will oppose each other
on the issue. Both men are former
Stanford debaters.
The debate will include the read
ing of replies from national candi
dates who were sent questionnaires
by the Stanford FAS chapter. Stan
ford's chapter, formed last year, is
made up of 30 members who pos
sess a Bachelor's degree in one of
the sciences. Undergraduates and
interested persons may become as
sociate members.
Since the ruling on political de
bates passed last spring by the
Board of Trustees, student debat
ers will also get into politics. All
those interested in participating in
a political debate sponsored by the
Debate Society are urged to try out
in Room 203-D tomorrow between
3:15 and 5 p.m. Two speakers will
be chosen to represent each party.
The date of the debate, to be held
in Cubberley Auditorium, will be
announced later on this week. The
debate decision will be based on
audience change of opinion.
