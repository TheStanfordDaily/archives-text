# Ike Charges Truman's Race Blast 'Falsehood'
## HST Levies New Attack 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 20 (UP)
—President Truman denied to
night that he called GOP presi
dential candidate Dwight D.
Eisenhower anti-sernitic or anti-
Catholic and said Republicans
are misinterpreting his remarks
to get votes.
At the same time. Mr. Truman un
leashed a new attaek on Eisenhower
for endorsing Republican Senators
who helj i'd override his veto of the
McCarran Immigration Bill. He said
he never would withdraw a word of
his criticism of Eisenhower on that
score.
The President issued a special
statement explaining his remarks of
last Fiiday to the National Jewish
Welfare Board. In that statement lie
said Eisenhower was the "captive"
of "anti-semitic, anti-Catholic and
anti-loreipn" forces in the GOP.
Truman declared, "the Republi
cans and a few others whom tney
were able to persuade to help them,
chose to distort the simple mean
ing' of mv words as a charge that
the Republican presidential candi
date is anti-Catholic and anti-
Jewish."
"i said no such thing, and indeed
meant no such thing and any fair
person who reads what in fact I
did say, must be as shocked as I
am by the absurdities in the press
of the last few days."
The President's statement appeared
tf> he a slap at Baruch, who Sunday
authorized the Eisenhower camp to
make public a letter he wrote the
retired General, praising him for his
"abhorrence of intolerance."
In his statement today, Mr. Truman
quoted the paragraphs from his
speech which touched off the furor.
In those remarks, he pointed out
that California's Richard M. Nixon,
the GOP vice presidential nominee,
and Sens. William E. Jenncr (R-
Ind.) and Joseph R. McCarthy
(R-VVis.) voted to override his veto
of the McCarran Bill.
He said Eisenhower had "em
braced" Jenncr and McCarthy,
along with ex-Senator Chapman
Revercomb of West Virginia.
The President, sticking by his
earlier statement, said he has made
clcar that Sen. Pat McCarran (D-
Nev.), sponsor of the Immigration
Bill, "is not my kind of Democrat."
Mr. Truman said that "what all of
this furor adds up to is that the Re
publicans in their eagerness to get
votes are trying to find in my state
ment of fact something that is not
there."

At the same time. Mr. Truman un
leashed a new attaek on Eisenhower
for endorsing Republican Senators
who helj i'd override his veto of the
McCarran Immigration Bill. He said
he never would withdraw a word of
his criticism of Eisenhower on that
score.
The President issued a special
statement explaining his remarks of
last Fiiday to the National Jewish
Welfare Board. In that statement lie
said Eisenhower was the "captive"
of "anti-semitic, anti-Catholic and
anti-loreipn" forces in the GOP.
Truman declared, "the Republi
cans and a few others whom tney
were able to persuade to help them,
chose to distort the simple mean
ing' of mv words as a charge that
the Republican presidential candi
date is anti-Catholic and anti-
Jewish."
"i said no such thing, and indeed
meant no such thing and any fair
person who reads what in fact I
did say, must be as shocked as I
am by the absurdities in the press
of the last few days."
The President's statement appeared
tf> he a slap at Baruch, who Sunday
authorized the Eisenhower camp to
make public a letter he wrote the
retired General, praising him for his
"abhorrence of intolerance."
In his statement today, Mr. Truman
quoted the paragraphs from his
speech which touched off the furor.
In those remarks, he pointed out
that California's Richard M. Nixon,
the GOP vice presidential nominee,
and Sens. William E. Jenncr (R-
Ind.) and Joseph R. McCarthy
(R-VVis.) voted to override his veto
of the McCarran Bill.
He said Eisenhower had "em
braced" Jenncr and McCarthy,
along with ex-Senator Chapman
Revercomb of West Virginia.
The President, sticking by his
earlier statement, said he has made
clcar that Sen. Pat McCarran (D-
Nev.), sponsor of the Immigration
Bill, "is not my kind of Democrat."
Mr. Truman said that "what all of
this furor adds up to is that the Re
publicans in their eagerness to get
votes are trying to find in my state
ment of fact something that is not
there."
