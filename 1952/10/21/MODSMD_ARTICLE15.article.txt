## Reds Jab Lightly; UN Men Dig In 
### 
TOKYO. Tuesday, Oct. 21 (UP) â€”
Communist commanders who sacri
ficed more than half a division in
eight days of bitter fighting for Tri
angle Hill and Sniper Ridge threw
light jabs at United Nations posi
tions along the 15.5-mile battlefront
early today.
American and South Korean
troops, weary from smashing a
fanatical 7.000 - man Chinese as
sault on Triangle and Sniper, iccd
the breather to dig in deeper,
construct new entrenchments, and
piece together "prefabricated"
hunkers during the cold, misty
night.
At Sniper Ridge on the central
front, the Communists sent two pla
toons of about 50 men in an hour
long probe at "Pinpoint," the domi
nating height of Sniper Ridge. The
Reds fell back under heavy mortar
fire along the same route the rem
nants of a regiment used for retreat
Monday when ROK troops recap
tured the position after 10 hours of
bloody fighting.
The Reii probe on Sniper was
the heavic.it of the night. At Tri
angle, two miles to the west,
American and Chinese troops ex
changed rifle fire. However, the
northwestmost height of the Tri-
U.S. Seventh Division troops made
angle Hill mass, lost Monday to
no attempt to retake Pike's Peak,
the "win-or-die" Chinese assault
that carried to .'5OO yards of the
crest of Triangle.
