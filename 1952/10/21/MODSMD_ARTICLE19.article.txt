EN ROUTE WITH EISEN
HOWER, Oct. 20 (UP) —Dwight
D. Eisenhower said today his
prominent Jpwish and Catholic
friends have proved that Presi
dent Truman falsified when he
charged Eisenhower "has had an
attack of moral blindness" on
racial and religious intolerance.
In his first comment on the Prcs
dent's charge, the Republican presi
dential nominee told a cheering
crowd at Providence, H 1., the Demo
crats have thrown a lot of lies at him
but that they had "overstepped"
themselves on the racial and reli
gious question.
"Ladies and gentlemen, I leave the
answers to those to my good friends.
Cardinal Spellman, Rabbi (Abba
Hillel) Silver and Bernard Baruch,"
he said. "Already they have estab
lished those stories for the false
hoods. that they are."
Baruch said yesterday that ha
does not agree with Mr. Truman -
charges and released a letter he had
written to Eisenhower telling how
much he admired the retired Gen
eral's "abhorrence of intolerance in
all fields."
Silver, a prominent Cleveland
Zionist, previously had said that
he was shocked by the President's
"irresponsible statements."
Spellman has made no public
comment on the charge, hut did
invite Eisenhower to lunch with
him and to speak at the Al Smith
Memorial dinner in New York last
week.
The controversy began last Fri
day when Mr. Truman said in a
message to the Jewish Welfare Board
that Eisenhower showed "moral
blindness" for endorsing senators
who had voted for the McCarran im
migration law which he said wai
anti-semitic, anti-Catholic and based
on the idea of a "master race."
In a day-long tour of Connecticut,
Rhode Island and Massachusetts
through snow, rain and finally clear
skies, the Republican presidential
nominee angrily denounced Demo
cratic "lies" that he would take away
social gains such as social security,
unemployment insurance and union
strength.
Then, in his major speech of the
day at Worcester, Mass., Eisen
hower outlined his basic beliefs t«»
counteract the "invective and. shall
we say, inaccurracies and distor
tions" thrown at him by President
Truman and Gov. Adlai E. Steven
son, the Democratic presidential
nominee.
