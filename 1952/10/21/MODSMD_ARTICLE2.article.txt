## Supreme Court to Decide On Scope of Taft-Hartley 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 2.0 (UP)â€”The Supreme Court agreed today
to decide whether the Taft-Hartley Act prohibits a union from
disciplining its members by denying them work.
The tribunal will rule on the question in two cases involving
two AFL unions The International Brotherhood of Teamsters and

the Radio Officers Division of the
Commercial Telegraphers Union.
In other actions during a brief
session, the court also:
Held, in effect, that seven per
sons, including the regional di
rector of Harry Bridges Interna
tional Longshoremen's Union must
stand trial at Honolulu on charges
rf conspiring to teach and advocate
the violent overthrow of this gov
ernment.
Refused to review a lower court
order in favor of Otis and Co.. Cleve
land banking firm, in its lengthy dis
pute with the Kaiser-Frazer Corp.
over a 1948 stock deal.
Rejected the appeals of four mur
derers awaiting execution.
In one of the labor cases, a truck
driver with the Byers Transporta
tion Co., Kansas City, Mo., was re
duced in seniority for work because
he failed to pay his dues in time to
the Teamsters Union.
In the other, Willard Christian
Fowler of Miami. Fia.. was denied a
job as Radio Officer with the Bull
Steamship Co. because he negotiated
with a company official before get
ting union "clearance."
The National Labor Relations
Board held that these practices
violate the Taft-Hartley Law, and
tin' second U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals upheld the board in the
Fowler case. However, in the team
ster case the Eighth U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals took the opposite
view.
Justice Hugo L. Black dissented
in the ease involving the Honolulu
seven. '! he men had asked the
tribunal to invalidate a Hawaiian
grand jury indictment charging
them with conspiring to teach and
advocate violent overthrow of this
gov eminent.
The convicted murderers whose
appeals were rejected included
,losi ph Louis Paonessa, for the kid
nap-murder of a 14-year-old Pough
keepsi". N.Y. boy; Alton Paris, Mon
talba, Tex., for the murder of a State
Wildlife Biologist in a game preserve,
and Robert Gene Dessauer for the
murder ol his common-law wife in
Hollywood, Calif.
