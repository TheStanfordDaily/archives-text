# BULL SESSION
## 
### BOB STETSON 
(At 7 o'clock Sunday night on the way from the
UCLA game, I suddenly realized I had not written the
Bull Session.
I scrawled this following gem on a suitcase in a
speeding car in the darkness of night. If you find it
hard to read, you will now know why.)
♦ * *
According to an article I read recently, a person's
sense of humor is at its highest point just after supper
in the evening. It is at its lowest ebb right after getting

up in the morning.
The Stanford Daily is a morning
newspaper. I am a humorist.
(Don't laugh at that last one, it's
too early in the morning.)
A humorist is a man who feels
bad but who feels good about it.
Last week after reading my
column all the way through
without cracking a smile, a for
mer friend of mine had only one
thing to say and that was a ques
tion, viz.:

"What is that white line down the left side of your
column?"
If this same problem is puzzling you, let me set
you straight. The white line is the margin (for
error). It puts an edge on the column.
Later I heard this same person remark that anyone
that has enough time to read all of Bob Stetson's
column has entirely too much time.
I choose my friends for their good looks, my ac
quaintances for their good characters, and my enemies
for their good intellects. I find it very embarrassing
to have this person for an enemy.

Besides,*he hasn't a single redeeming vice.
Seriously, though, there is nothing wrong with the
Tuesday Bull Session that a new writer couldn't
change.
* * *
My roommate remarked last week that the only
time the windows are open in our room is when some
body throws away a cigarette butt or wants to drop
a water bomb.
The only change college has made so far is that we
used to look to see if there was anyone under the
window. Now the burning weed is merely flicked out
into space.
The marvels of a college education.

The love life of a Stanford first-year man:
First week—"Where is Ruble?"
Second week—"Let's go to Rossotti's, men."
Third week—"How do j on meet Poly High » r irls?"
Fourth week—"Let's go to Rossotti's, men."
Fifth week—"Which way to Watsonville?"

, While they were serenely masticating hamburgers
in Fresno, two first-year men, Henry Sargent and
Dick Fageburg, awoke to the fact that they had left
their UCLA-game tickets languishing at home in
picturesque Encina Hall.
They could not feature driving 400 miles to listen
to the game on the radio so by purchasing general
admission tickets for $2.50 and pulling indecent strings
they finally managed to get into the rooting section.
Total cost in tickets to watch UCLA triumph—s4.2o.

, While they were serenely masticating hamburgers
in Fresno, two first-year men, Henry Sargent and
Dick Fageburg, awoke to the fact that they had left
their UCLA-game tickets languishing at home in
picturesque Encina Hall.
They could not feature driving 400 miles to listen
to the game on the radio so by purchasing general
admission tickets for $2.50 and pulling indecent strings
they finally managed to get into the rooting section.
Total cost in tickets to watch UCLA triumph—s4.2o.

UCLA game, I suddenly realized I had not written the
Bull Session.
I scrawled this following gem on a suitcase in a
speeding car in the darkness of night. If you find it
hard to read, you will now know why.)

According to an article I read recently, a person's
sense of humor is at its highest point just after supper
in the evening. It is at its lowest ebb right after getting

up in the morning.
The Stanford Daily is a morning
newspaper. I am a humorist.
(Don't laugh at that last one, it's
too early in the morning.)
A humorist is a man who feels
bad but who feels good about it.
Last week after reading my
column all the way through
without cracking a smile, a for
mer friend of mine had only one
thing to say and that was a ques
tion, viz.:

"What is that white line down the left side of your
column?"
If this same problem is puzzling you, let me set
you straight. The white line is the margin (for
error). It puts an edge on the column.
Later I heard this same person remark that anyone
that has enough time to read all of Bob Stetson's
column has entirely too much time.
I choose my friends for their good looks, my ac
quaintances for their good characters, and my enemies
for their good intellects. I find it very embarrassing
to have this person for an enemy.

Besides,*he hasn't a single redeeming vice.
Seriously, though, there is nothing wrong with the
Tuesday Bull Session that a new writer couldn't
change.

My roommate remarked last week that the only
time the windows are open in our room is when some
body throws away a cigarette butt or wants to drop
a water bomb.
The only change college has made so far is that we
used to look to see if there was anyone under the
window. Now the burning weed is merely flicked out
into space.
The marvels of a college education.
