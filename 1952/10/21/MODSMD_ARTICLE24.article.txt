## 'No Reason for Confusion' 
### 
To the Editor:
I submit that there is no reason for the editor (Miss
Dodge) to be confused (i.e. "Hoover Adds to the Con
fusion," Stanford Daily, Vol. 122, No. 16), and that,
with an honest approach to the Hoover speech, her
confusion will be, or should be, completely resolved.
It would seem that her first source of confusion lies
in her assumption that Mr. Hoover is not basically con
servative in his approach to the role of government in
American affairs.
Mr. Hoover, in his speech of last Saturday night, did
not, to my knowledge, try to show that the Republican
party has not been conservative, but rather his talk
was in the form of an answer to the charge so often
heard that the Republican Party is reactionary. All
of the ex-President's facts and figures concerning the
interest of the Republican Party in the welfare of the
nation were used to refute this charge of reaction—
not to purport that the party is one of radical "New
deal-like" reforms or to take issue with Senator Taft
(a man with whom Mr. Hoover is in full accord).
This Republican progress, as outlined by Mr. Hoover,
exemplifies, in its nature, a cautious, conservative,
"look-before-you-leap" policy. Whereas, at least in
the minds of Hoover, Taft, and other conservatives,

the welfare measures of the New Deal represent
radically irrational attempts to virtually collectivise
our society. Herein, then, seems to lie the second
element of our editor's confusion—that reactionaries
and conservatives are the same individuals.
Indeed, Mr. Hoover contends that his policies would
have stopped the depression if allowed to continue un
altered and that the policies of the New Deal never
really did cure the depression—that the depression
was finaly abated only by the advent of the second
World War. Certainly then no one could accuse Mr.
Hoover of advicating New Deal reforms.
Although our editor, Miss Dodge, is admittedly a
Democrat and would naturally have a political axe
to grind with Republicans in general this time of year,
it would seem that her confusion was possibly not
altogether an understandable one, but was partially
an effort to be anti-Republican purely because it is
politically necessary for Democrats to act this way
during a campaign. The effort here is not to single out
Miss Dodge as the only guilty party but to use her edi
torial as an example of this type of campaign thinking
which I consider to be basically unconstructive and
unsound.
