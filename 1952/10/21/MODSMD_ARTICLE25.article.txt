# By Faculty and Administration
## From Another Viewpoint 
### 
(Editor's note: Beginning today, the Daily brings
you a weekly column by members of the faculty
and administration. We are beginning this feature
because: (i) we feel it is one more way to make use
of the talent to lie found in the faculty and adminis
tration; (2) we hope it will bring the students and
faculty a little closer together.
Today's column is written by Ernest R. Hilgard,
now Dean of the Graduate Division and formerly
head of the Psychology Department. Dr. Ililgard's
enthusiasm about his work and personal magnetism
have made him a favorite of many of his students).
DOES COLLEGE HARM STUDENTS?
A great deal of soul-searching has gone on in our
ci.llt .s es ond universities since World War 11, and many
p!?ns have been proposed for broadening general
education, for paying attention to values, for getting
at the interrelatedness of knowledge. I am pleased
that these self-studies are going on, and that Stanford
is engaged in them. What worries me, however, is
something far deeper than the problem of what courses
shall be required in lower division. I am worried lest
wo may do a student more harm than good, lest some
of our potentially most creative students might not be

belter off if they hadn't come.
More specifically, I am afraid
that what we do may injure or
destroy some of the ingredients of
a t'.v'y creative and productive
life.
In iiterature, art, and music
whs..t we ought to admire is the
capacity for self-expression
throurrh these media â€” not mere
cultivation of taste, or smug criti
cisi i, or dilettantism. Do we get
creativity, or do we stifle it?
In the physical and biological

ciences (and their professional counterparts in en

gineering and medicine) what we want is a spirit of
inquiry, a search for problems, a sense of excitement
about delving into the unknown. Any good technician
can collect data once a problem is formulated and a
research design worked out. Are our students of sci
ence learning how to discover problems, how to
initiate such learning. After looking at countless slides,
or learning the properties of countless substances, a
student may be overwhelmed by what is already
known, rather than eager about where he might ex
plore.
In the social sciences (and the related professional
work in education, law, and business) we want in
ventiveness, too, based on alertness to imperfections
in present social arrangements, with examination of
possible solutions. Do students become engrossed in
ways of increasing decency in human relations, in
providing arrangements for harmonious and zestful
living, in proposals for dealing with such anachronisms
as racial bigotry and divisive nationalism? Or do they
sit and listen passively to learned discussions of these
issues, dutifully answering appropriate questions on
midquartcr and final examinations?
While in college the student has a fine opportunity
to order his personal values so that his life will have
some focus, to devote himself sacrificially to causes
in which he believes, to take responsibility and learn
the v/ays of leadership. But most of these opportuni
ties, important as they are, come outside the curricu
lum. Need the curriculum be sterile of these things?
Maybe some really inventive and original students
are stiftled by notetaking, textbook reading, and fol
lowing the steps in a laboratory manual. If there are
some who feel themselves hemmed in or hammered
down, rather than invited to share in an adventure,
they ought to make themselves heard. I am sure that
Stanford is flexible enough to modify its program to
accommodate them.
