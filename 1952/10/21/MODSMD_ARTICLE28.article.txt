# Farm Geologist Aids In Submarine Quest

They traveled 12,000 miles
across the ocean on a tugboat
to come home with tons of "glo
bigerina ooze," containing clues
lhat may someday enable man
to realize the ocean's potentiali
ties.
Among the scientists on the tug
'"Kevin Moran" was Stanford stu
dent Jon Lindbergh, who returned
to rchool last week.
The expedition, primarily con- ;
cerned with submarine geology, !
sailed from Hoboken, N.J., to the
Azores, Dakar, and Recife. Brazil. !
before returning to New York laden
with samples of the land and water ;
hey sailed over.
The "Kevin Moran" crew were
searching for many things. One
of the major projects, according to
Lindbergh, was "coving," or driv
ing pipes deen into the ocean's
bottom to bring up the sediment
which •sometimes lay 30,000 feet
thick on the ocean bottom.
The scientists were curious, too,
about what lay beneath the mud.
They analyzed the composition of
the ocean bottom with sound waves
from charges of high explosive that
were refracted through the bottom
substances.
Lindbergh laughed, remember
ing one extra-curricular use of
the explosive. A passenger ship
which had strayed into the shoot
ing area one ntfjht was consider
ably alarmed when 10- and 15-
pound charges exploded with re
sounding (although harmless)
blasts.
Another project was collecting
and analyzing water from various
depths. From the amount of carbon
14 found in the water, scientists can
analyze the water's age and the
speed of the current.
Dr. Maurice Ewing of Columbia
University, leader of the expedi
tion, was particularly interested
in studying the nature of the so
called "turbidity currents," un
derwater mud flows. Lindbergh
explained Dr. Ewing's theory that
mud piled up on the continental
shelf slips off and flows down
ward, scouring out oceanic can
yons on its way.
While exploring the paths of these j
currents, the expedition discovered
an underwater canyon 800 miles in j

| length, apparently formed by mud
| just as water forms land canyons.
The theory can be proved only

after complete analysis of the find- I
ings of this and other expeditions,
analyses which are impossible on a I
sharply pitching tug.
