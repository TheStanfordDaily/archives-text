# Future Grid Opponents Boast Impressive Record
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
While the varsity was taking it on the chin in the Los Angeles
Coliseum Saturday, the Indians' future grid opponents continued
to compile an impressive won and lo3t record.
Four of the next five Stanford rivals recorded wins over the
weekend, as perfect a record as they cculd achieve since two of

the teams \ve2e playing each ether. H
That gives the '"lutuj r five" a total |
of 18 wins and seven defeats fur the |
year.
Incidentally, the composite won j
and lost mark for all Caid oppo- j
nents this ajj on is 23 victories as 1
against 20 los es. a good indication I
that the In.'ian eleven is not knock
ing over any soft touches this year. J
Game Highlight's
Now a review of the highlights of |
those five Saturday games:
Washington 4!), Oregon 0 — Don
Heinrich and Co. swamped the hap
less Ducks with a tremendous of- l
fensive and defensive show in the 1
first three quarters. The Bremerton
Bazooka tossed for three touch- j
downs to set a new PCC career ;
total record, while the improved
Husky defense intercepted r.ine
Oregon parses, also a Conference i
mark. Washington piled up five o! I
their seven TD's in tiie fir.-t half, !
and tlien took it easy the rest of the j
way.
San Jo>:e State 2(i, CCP 21-Sub
halfback Roy Hiram raced yards
for the Spartans' winning touch
down wiih but 24 seconds Lo go in
this one. Hiram thus atoned for his
fumble earlier in the fourth quar- j
ter which gave the Tigers the ap- j
parent winning tally. Tom McCor- I
mick accounted for all t.he COP |
scores and rambled for 147 net i
yards. San Jose continued to amass !
tremendous yardage, this time 452
net yards through the air and on
the ground.
SC Offense Better
use 28, Oregon State 6—The Tro
jans improved their offense some
what, but it was the defence which
shone in this rather listless affair.
SC finally got their offensive team
to account for all the scores, but :
the defensive eleven smeared the 1
Beavers for minus 20 yards rush
ing and only 03 yards passing. Des ;
Koch kept OSC bottled up for most
of the game with his booming punts. I
Koch averaged 54.3 yards for six
kicks.
California 27. Santa Clara 7—The

| Bears, obviou ly with an eye on the
i USC game this week, ground out
the win over the outmanned but
game Erones. Cal crunched to two
I 'allies in the fir. t quarter, and then
went inlo a shell until the la t pe
riod when they pu hed over the
final two scores. Halfback Eil! Pow
ell stole some of Johnny Olszew
ski's thunder with tinee of the Beat
! touchdowns. Santa Clara gave CV
a good scare in the third quartei
when they crept lo within seven
points, but the Bears, although giv
j ing a subpar performance, then ap-
J plied the pressure.
This Week's Action
The Los Angeles Coliseum, for
1 the second straight week, will fea
| lure the PCC's top game. Clashing
Saturday will be Cal and USC. both
, winners of their first five games
and both eager to get a shot at the
Big Ten champion in the Rose Bcwl.
UCLA steps out of the conference
to play the day's top intersectional
contest with Wiseon in. 1 nere is a
good chance that this might be a
preview of the Rose Bowl game.
In other games, Washington State
! and Oregon State are slated to meet
| in a battle of "have nuts" at Pull
| man, while Oregon gets a softer foe
j in Montana at Eugene, and Idaho
comes to San Francisco to play
| Santa Clara.
