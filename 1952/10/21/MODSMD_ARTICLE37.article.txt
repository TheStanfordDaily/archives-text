# Gridders in Hard Scrum
## 
### 
Stanford's gridders went through
a rough scrimmage with running
plays the order of the day. ' Oui
plan against Washington is simple.
We'll score so much and so often
that they'll never catch us," Coach
Chuck Taylor explained.
Bruises were numerous from last
Saturday's UCLA go, but' the only
serious casualties were Chuck Es
segian and Ron Eadie, a pair of de-

I fensive standouts, who will miss the
Husky tilt because of knee injuries.
Marsh Howe will take over Eise
gian's key line-backer post, while
Ron Bush or Bob Hoegh will prob
ably take Eadie's spot.
Yesterday's scrimmage was sur
-1 prisingly rough for Monday. Many
first-stringers were taking it easy
| on the sidelines, but everybody in
! shape was taking part in the scrum,
j which lasted well over an hour. Jim
I Stewart and Chuck Brazel were
carrying out most of the offensive
! chorea.


RON EADIE
â€”Will miss Husky contest
