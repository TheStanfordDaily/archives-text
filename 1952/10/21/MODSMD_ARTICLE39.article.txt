ALL THE WAY—ALMOST—Bob Mathias had hopes of duplicating his sensational kickoff run
back against USC last season on this play Saturday. Big Bob took the boot 011 the Indian six and
rambled all the way to the Bruin 39 yard marker before he was hauled down. Card in the back
ground (36) is guard Win Wedge. UCLA man is Don Dunaway (25).
