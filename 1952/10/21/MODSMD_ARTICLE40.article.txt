# Dekes Win Over V-314; Toro Beats Capitan, 12-6
## 
### 
With diminutive Sid Hall leading the attack, Deke I romped to j
an impressive 19-0 intramural football victory yesterday over a i
stubborn Yi^ a g e 314 team.
While completing 11 out of 16 passes for two scores, Hall found j
time to run for another touchdown and pass for an extra point.

A tough defensive line, anchored <
by Terry O'Neal, held the Villagers j
down in their own territory most of :
the afternoon.
The twu passing plays came in j
the second quarter, when Hall !
fived a 24-yard pass to Vince Ross ;
in the end zone and a 34-yarder to
Bob White on the one-yard line.
Hall sprint 36 yards in ths fourth
quarter for the final score.
In perhaps the thriller of the day, j
the El Toros locked horns with the i
El Capitans in a game featuring !
outstanding defensive play from the j
opening whistle. When the game
was over the Bulls were out in j
front, 12-6, mo.tly on the passing !
of Daily Sports Editor Larry Cahn,
who threw for one score to Don
Swedenborg and set up another on
a series of tosses to the Capitan
four - yard line. Ken Sunfors
smashed over for the TD.
A team of pre-med students, the !
Frosh Medics, scored the most im- !
pressive victory of the afternoon |
when they rolled to an eaty 33-0 !
win over Village 206.
With a scoring display that would
make most pro football observers
drool, the Medics were led by Mike
Nelson's four TD passing plays.
Harry Skinner :eceived two of the

passes, while Alex Pinto and Harry
Murray grabbed two more for
scores. â€”Don Stephens
