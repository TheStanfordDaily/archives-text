# Mine Owners Offer WSB Wage Increase

### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 20 (UP) â€”
Northern soft coal operators ap
pealed today to the 350,000 striking
soft coal miners to return to the pits
under the scaled-down pay raise
approved by the Wage Stabilization
Board.
Simultaneously, John L. Lewis,
president of the United Mine
workers' Union, summoned his
200-man wage policy committee to
a meeting in Washington Wednes
day to discuss the situation.
Harry M. Moses, president of the
Bituminous Coal Operators' Asso
ciation and chief industry negotia
tor, wrote Lewis that Northern pro
ducers are ready to start paying the
miners the $1.50-a-day wage in
crease approved by the wage board
Saturday.
Moses' letter indicated, howev
er, that the Northern operators
consider thai (he board's action
means they have a firm contract
with Lewis for a $5-a-day in
crease and that the miners have
an obligation to work under these
terms.
Lewis has taken the position that
he negotiated a contract only on the
basis of a $1.50-a-day increase and
that failure of the wage board to
approve the full amount cancels the
agreement.
