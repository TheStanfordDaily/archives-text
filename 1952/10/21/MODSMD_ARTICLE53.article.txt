# 'Cathedral Murder' Strikes Stanford Second Time in Mem And Production
## 
### JOANNE WALKER 
In 1937, on Oct. 29, the Stanford Players presented "Murder in
the Cathedral," T. S. Eliot's poetical drama.
This year, again on Oct. 29, the Stanford Players will present
the same play.
This is the first time since the building of Memorial Auditorium

in 1937 that a play has been re
peated there.
When the Stanford Mothers' Club
presented this play 15 years ago, it
was staged in Memorial Hall, which
had been formally dedicated only a
week before.
Among the impressive features
of the play were, according to the
Stanfr d Dailv, the "massive set
tings and special stpfje effects that
had', been impossible in the days
of the old Assembly Hall plays."
These massive settings included
'archcs rising 32 feet into the air"
and "a mammoth hexagonal ramp
stretching from the footlights to
the altar at the rear wall of the
stage."
In contrast, the current produc
tion is to be staged in the Little
Theater where a smaller cast and
simpler settings will be used. The
odore Marcuse, a graduate student
who has returned from a successful

professional career for an advanced
degree in speech and drama, is di
recting the play.
The play itself lias been one of
the most controversial plays of
our time. It was Kliot's first in
ternational success with verse
drama. Based on the murder of
Thomas a Becket at Canterbury,
"Murder in the Cathedral" deals
with the conflict between man's
duty to man and man's duty to
God. This struggle, Eliot believed,
is characteristic of this afe. Thus
the pipy 4L'als with here and now
as well as with then and there.
This year's "Murder in the Ca
thedral" is scheduled for the eve
nings of Oct. 29, 30, 31, and Nov. 1.
Tickets are on sale at the Memorial
Auditorium box office for 50 cents.
