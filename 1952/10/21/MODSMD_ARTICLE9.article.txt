Its that man again!
That well-known representative of
the Farm, the Stanford man's Stan
lord Man, Warren G. Wonka, has
lett his mark again—this time in the
latest issue of Colliers.
Wonka, dissatisiied with Colliers
reporting in a recent article on cam
pus styles, wrote in to the editors of
the magazine, and his letter made
the "Week's Mail" column of the
magazine, on page eight of the Oct.
25 issue.
Wrote Warren G.:
. . In regard to your uninformed
article 'Campus Cues for Clothes,'
no Stanford student would even
dream of starting a school year with
so few as three suits and only five
sweaters."
And the editors, apparently un
informed as to the Farm habitat and
current Stanford styles, appreciated
Wonka's letter to put over their
point.
This was Wonka's latest in a long
series of misadventures from an ac
cident in Oregon last year (as re
ported by the Associated Press) to a
letter from Estes Kefauver for his
contribution to the Kefauver cam
paign.
