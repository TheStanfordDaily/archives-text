TANK HIDES—This tank hides in a protective smoke screen
as its ROK crew fires on enemy positions in the bitterly con

men keep firing. United Nations troops hurled what appeared
to be their heaviest attack on the Red line in a year in smashing
blow at Chinese-held positions on the west-central front.
