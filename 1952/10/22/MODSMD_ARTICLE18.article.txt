### 
Forty - five faculty members
are sponsoring an "Appeal to
Support Adlai Stevenson for
President." Under the chairman
ship of Dr. Wallace Stegner, di
rector of the Creative Writing In
stitute, the appeal is designed to
raise funds for more Stevenson
radio and TV time in northern
, California.
In a letter dated October 14 and
sent to members of the faculty, the
Stevenson supporters stated their
purpose in the fund-raising drive.
"In addresses before veteran and
labor conventions he (Stevenson)
has not hesitated to warn powerful
pressure groups that they could not
expect special favors from him. Per
haps you have read his courageous
message to the Illinois Legislature
in defense of academic freedom and
j personal liberties.
"These qualities which appeal
to us so strongly arc not an un- j
mixed asset in a political cam
paign. They involve the risk of
displeasing voting blocs. They
j make it impossible to secure large 1
I contributions from some of the [
usual sources.
"Wo think that those who admire i
Stevenson's independence and cour- i
age have a special responsibility to !
help him reach the voters. His views
! and his record are unfamiliar to
many voters in Northern California.
The only way to overcome this han
dicap is by purchase of radio and
television time to match the large
covering already contracted for by
his opponents."
Five other leaders of the drive
besides Dr. Stegner are:
Albert H. Bowker, associate pro
fessor of statistics; John D. Goheen,
professor of philosophy; Bernard F.
Haley, reference librarian; David
Harris, professor of history; and
