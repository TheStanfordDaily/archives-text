### 
TOKYO, Wednesday, Oct. 22 (UP) â€”A 1,500-man Chinese fly
ing wedge attack on Sniper Ridge was crushed early today by
defending South Korean troops aided by ankle-deep mud.
Chinese troops who tried to fight up the slippery sides of the long
east-central front ridge line shortly after nightfall last night came

back in a heavy downpour of rain<
just before dawn and managed to
work a few men into ROK Second
Division positions before they were
killed or driven off.
Rain brought a lull to action along
the rest of the Korean battlefront.
Five Red companies launched the
pre-dawn assault on Sniper, mov
ing up the difficult slope in com
plete darkness. Allied flare planes
were unable to illuminate the bat
tlefield and ROK troops fired by I
sound until the Red advance ele- \
ments hit the main defense posi- j
tions.
