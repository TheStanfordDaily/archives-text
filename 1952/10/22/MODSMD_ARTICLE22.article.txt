## 
### 
Approximately 150 members of the Stanford faculty and staff
endorsed the candidacy of Democratic standard bearer Adlai
Stevenson during a whirl-wind petition drive on campus yesterdny.
The petition, the same as the one circulated at Columbia Uni
versity last week, charges that General Eisenhower, the Republi

''can hopeful, has sold out to "un
desirable elements" and declares that
Stevenson is the man fit for the
presidency.
On campus, the petition was
circulated under the direction of
| Dr. Arthur Wright, associate pro
fessor of history. Dr. Wright said
| last night that response to the pe
tition was "exceptionally good.
He expects to add another sft
| names to the petition today.
An addition of 50 signatures to the
petition would mean that about one
fourth of the faculty and staff have
endorsed Stevenson's candidacy.
There are 840 faculty and staff mem
bers. This figure includes teaching
! and lab assistants.
Friday the petition will he pub
lished along with the names of the
faculty members, in a full-page
advertisement in the Palo Alto
Times.
The petition was first circulated
at Columbia University last week
and was published in the New
York Times on Oct. I(i. More than
1160 members of the Columbia fac
ulty signed the petition whi'i
severely criticizes Eisenhower.
The Columbia petition is con
sidered particularly significant in a ,
much as Eisenhower is president of
that institution.
The circulation ot the petition
j here is part of a nation-wide
drive urged b> the "Volunteers
for Steven'on of Columbia Uni
versity." Dr. Wright reported h°,
j received a f»,vm letter from the
g %ip giving instructions for a
petition drive.
The Stanford group is (lie second
college faculty in the nation tu
openly endorse a candidate.
The petition, one of the most
strongly worded political docu
ments of the campaign, asset 's tha<
"General Eisenhower has been
i vague or inconsistent on most
j issues, has borrowed Democratic
planks on a few, and has been, in
our opinion, wrong on most crucial
j questions before him."
"He has been wrong on his waver
I ing foreign policy pronouncements,
wrong on tidelands oil, wrong on
civil rights, wrong in surrendering
to Taft, wrong in absolving Nixon,
wrong in embracing Jenner, wrong
in accepting McCarthy. We deplore,
i too, the attempt in the Republican
J campaign to exploit the loss of
j American lives in Korea—which
ja national sorrow —as an issue in
j partisan policies."
Then, turning to Stevenson, the
petition reads, "Governor Steven
! son has not hesitated to take issue
with his Democratic predecessors
and has differed with other power
ful Democrats."
On the other hand, the petition
claims, "Eisenhower has declared
his support of all Republican candi -
dates."
After praising Stevenson for his
stand against IWcCarthyism, his
effective record against corruption,
the petition concludes, "We feel
I that this is too critical an hour in
j our country's history to entrust
cur destinies and our children's
destinies to a soldier who has
j served his country in war but has
not mastered the arts of civilian
state craft. This is no time for
anything less than the wisest,
steadiest and most responsible,
leadership we can find. Therefore
we will vote for Adlai Stevenson."
