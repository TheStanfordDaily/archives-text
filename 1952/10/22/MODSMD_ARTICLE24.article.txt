# Taft-Hartley Bogey Man
## 
### 
The Taft-Hartley Act floats through the cur
re it political campaign—a fuzzy gray bogey
man obscured by a cloud of emotion and mis
understanding.
It has inspired a lot of name calling and a
Jot oI irrational argument. Rarely has it been
considered calmly and rationally.
To begin with, the attitudes ol both parties
toward this particular piece of legislation are
based in paradox.
The Republicans profess to oppose "too
much government." They argue for decentral
ization and talk about cutting the tentacles of
the ' Washington octopus."
Yet Taft-Hartley government influ
ence farther into the collective bargaining
process than at any time in the history.of our
country. Provisions like that empowering the
President to step in during a strike are a de
liberate contradiction of the stated Hepubli
can philosophy.
Democratic attitudes toward the law are just
as enigmatic. The Democratic party has long
stood for the intelligent use of federal legisla
tion for the public good, yet President Truman
wavered and bounced the Taft-Hartley ball
back and forth pitifully during last year's steel
strike. That he placed political considerations
above the public good is the most obvious ex
planation.
Examined calmly, the Taft-Hartley law, like
most things, is neither black nor white. It was
a well-intentioned act, based on reasonable con- '

siderations. Many people felt that the Wagner
Act had pushed the pendulum of power too far
to the side of labor. And they have many good
arguments on their side.
However, in practice, the law has proved
unworkable in many respects. And it is
questionable if labor has even given it a fair
chance to operate.
The most encouraging aspect is that both
Stevenson and Eisenhov/er seem to compre
hend the situation.
The Republican standard bearer has come
out in favor of amending the law. He appears
to see the need of restoring the collective bar
gaining process to the control of labor and
management. However, he has remained silent
on some provisions of the law and his over-all
stand has not satisfied labor.
Stevenson has resisted the temptation to do
labor's bidding and has declared that lie hopes
to salvage portions of the act, which he de
scribes as "no slave labor law." He believes
a new law should be written, and we feel this
is a sensible proposal, at least partly because
enforcement of the present law is obstructed
by so many irrational pressures.
However the election goes, we hope the win
ning candidate will be able to take a rational
view of the need for labor legislation. We hope
he will support a law which puts the common
good above the benefit of whichever pressure
group has the stronger influence on him.—Dor
