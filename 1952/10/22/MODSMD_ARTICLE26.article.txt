## 'The GOP Has Made Up Its Mind' 
### 
To the Editor:
We are not confused, but we are most certainly
concerned! Your editorial regarding former Presi
dent Hoover's recent address, however, shows much
confusion and a lash distortion of facts. With the aim
of educating and reflecting facts as they are, we find
wo have something to talk about too.
The ex-President couldn't have been more truth
ful if he had outrightly claimed that a great deal of
what the Democrats have developed and carried on
since ihey succeeded the Republican administration
in '32 was originated by Republicans; and, indeed,
Mr. Hoover still thinks those institutions and laws
are good. What he disapproves of are the ways and
means by which the Democrats moved in, overlook
ing everything that didn't fall in line with their aims,
and simply appropriated and developed what they
did like and called it their own innovation.
And furthermore, since when doe? "conserva
tive'' mean sitting on your hands in an easy chair
and watching the world go by? By declaring that
conservatism in Republicans exists on one side, and
their approval of social progress on the other, you
directly infer this connotation.
Republicans are well aware that a Democratic
government's purpose and responsibility is to piovide
for its people's welfare. They would not consider
.tier, selves qualified to be elected to office if they
were not possessors of the equipment, means, and
ideas to govern toward thi.«? goal. Republicans and
Democrats are united in their approval of social ad
vancements. but just how far can "federal power and
centralization" be extended in the name of society's
welfare without curtailing the basic rights and free
doms belonging to all men in our democracy? The
Republicans say extend in moderation and insure the
welfare of the whole of society, not just a few chosen
sectors. Obviously, the difference is one of degree,
but because of "moderation" Republicans are labeled
Conservative!
(11 conclusion, may we assuredly say there is no
"basic lack of agreement" in the Republican party!
Any "confusion" found in party policy is originated
in the minds of individuals who are afraid to fully
understand and accept Republican platforms and
records in their non-adulterated forms. Such un
derstanding might result in a realization of the
truth and honesty of the opposition.
The GOP HAS made up its mind! It HAS de
termined its united course of positive action and is

proving to (he American people who are intelligent
enough to sift fantasy from facts and rid their minds
of confusion that the Republican records and prin
ciples of action equip the party to take the reins of
government and give our country the clear-think
ing honest administration Americans will be asking
for if they vote Mr. Hoover's party into office this
November.

To the Editor:
We are not confused, but we are most certainly
concerned! Your editorial regarding former Presi
dent Hoover's recent address, however, shows much
confusion and a lash distortion of facts. With the aim
of educating and reflecting facts as they are, we find
wo have something to talk about too.
The ex-President couldn't have been more truth
ful if he had outrightly claimed that a great deal of
what the Democrats have developed and carried on
since ihey succeeded the Republican administration
in '32 was originated by Republicans; and, indeed,
Mr. Hoover still thinks those institutions and laws
are good. What he disapproves of are the ways and
means by which the Democrats moved in, overlook
ing everything that didn't fall in line with their aims,
and simply appropriated and developed what they
did like and called it their own innovation.
And furthermore, since when doe? "conserva
tive'' mean sitting on your hands in an easy chair
and watching the world go by? By declaring that
conservatism in Republicans exists on one side, and
their approval of social progress on the other, you
directly infer this connotation.
Republicans are well aware that a Democratic
government's purpose and responsibility is to piovide
for its people's welfare. They would not consider
.tier, selves qualified to be elected to office if they
were not possessors of the equipment, means, and
ideas to govern toward thi.«? goal. Republicans and
Democrats are united in their approval of social ad
vancements. but just how far can "federal power and
centralization" be extended in the name of society's
welfare without curtailing the basic rights and free
doms belonging to all men in our democracy? The
Republicans say extend in moderation and insure the
welfare of the whole of society, not just a few chosen
sectors. Obviously, the difference is one of degree,
but because of "moderation" Republicans are labeled
Conservative!
(11 conclusion, may we assuredly say there is no
"basic lack of agreement" in the Republican party!
Any "confusion" found in party policy is originated
in the minds of individuals who are afraid to fully
understand and accept Republican platforms and
records in their non-adulterated forms. Such un
derstanding might result in a realization of the
truth and honesty of the opposition.
The GOP HAS made up its mind! It HAS de
termined its united course of positive action and is

proving to (he American people who are intelligent
enough to sift fantasy from facts and rid their minds
of confusion that the Republican records and prin
ciples of action equip the party to take the reins of
government and give our country the clear-think
ing honest administration Americans will be asking
for if they vote Mr. Hoover's party into office this
November.
