To the Editor:
When I read the Daily editorial today (with its
remarkable heading) about the effect of Herbert
Hoover's Saturday speech upon the editor (who
properly spoke of herself as "we"—editors may) I
was sorry about it. Dorothy is, I think, a young
friend of mine; and any Stanford student deserves
help when he or she admits confusion. So I squashed
my first two mischievous reactions —that this was the
lirst editor (Daily) I've read who admitted confusion,
and this the first time I'd ever known HH to con
fuse anybody. Many people have come out of their
corners fighting, but they emerged notably uncon
fused as to what he said, however wickedly they
tried to twist it. Also 1 remembered that I have
almost always been confused by Mr. Truman's state
ments. So have the White House reporters. The
.secretariat usually bustled out later with an expla
nation of what Mr. Truman meant by what he just
said, which reverses his statement, so I remain con
fused. On the present whistle-stop trip Mr. Truman
issues his reversing statements himself and then re
peats the contradicted version. So why not skip (he
whole thing? Mr. Stevenson often circles the same
way in speaking. I don't even try to understand
New-Dealing.
So. thinking the editor was trying to understand
the Republican party, I wrote her what I knew
about it—not to try to change her convictions in
any way, just to supply her with the principles ol
the other side since she was honest about confusion.
However, tonight, someone at my dinner table said.
"What a pity that every other Stanford student—
most of them at UCLA during the broadcast—learns
nothing about the Hoover speech except that the
editor didn't, like it." That's a fact—for sure. I'm
sorry there, too.
So jf any Republican, Independent, or curious
Democrat student wants to read that speech, copies
are securable by writing to Republican National
Headquarters, Washington, D.C., and asking for it.
If anyone else is confused about what the Republi
can party stands for, after reading that speech, 1
will try to help him or her if they will drop me a
note with questions—to Box 3020, Stanford Uni
versity.
