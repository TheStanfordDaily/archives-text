Today, we're not going to write about the recent UCLA game or the
Washington game coming up. Or about C;.hn pro-ing it up with his
erasers or üboiit Marvin 0. Adams (see lettt rs to the editor) taking a shower
while waiting for tlu' traffic to thin out. Or about Zeke Wallace playing
"A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody" on his violin while the UCLA Queen
drives by. Or about Stanford losing its two best defensive men, Chuck j
Essegian and Hon Eadie.
Today, we iv looking for the silver lining in the future. We mean the j
future ltiture, not the immediate future.
Nobody has had the urge to say, "Wait til next year," but nevertheless, ;
the Indians should be loaded next season. Nor 11 Manoogian, the best
guard in the country, is saving his eligibility until next fall, having incurred i
i! knee injury beiore the first game this year. Dob Mathiax has another 1
year of i ligibikty and may take advantage of it.
Look, at iIn j Fi'osh
Sweetest of all. Bob Ghilotli has soine great freshmen prospects this
year. The yearlings mutilated the UCLA frosh, 42 tu 0. Wight now. they're
saying nice things about a U foot, one inch 194 pound halfback named Jim
Truher. They're saying he's the best prospect to hit the Farm since a
_____ gangling kid named Bill McColl enrolled here.

Listen to Connie Jarvis. trainer and good guy.
"if you stuck this kid Truher in the 49er
dressing room, you couldn't tell the difference
between him and one of the pros. That's the
way he carries himself."
Truher does the 10() in !).8, is agile, power
ful, and a good pass receiver. He also kicks
ofl and can convert. He lias a blocking weak
ness light now. but frosh coach Bob Ghilotli
says. "He's not afraid of contact, and he'll
learn how to block."
Against UCLA. Truher only played the first
quarter. What did he do . . . just produce
touchdown gallops of ill) yards and (>2 yards.
Another hot prospect is John Stewart, a

[)' 3" glue-fingered end from Puly High.
Stewart, who also tallied twice against the Brubabes, is the Sam Morley !
typ<? of end and somewhat faster than Morley.
Another boy who should help the varsity out is linebacker Tom Me- '
Keima, a touuh aggressive Manoogian type of player. Fullback Bill Tarr. I
185 pounds, i.s a very hard runner and a good receiver. Joel Sappenlield
is the best of a good crop of guards and tackles. He i.s 200 pounds and
quick as a cat. An excellent blocker.
Another outstanding prospect is Steve Doctor, a 212 pound end from
Santa Barbara. He reaches six feet three inches into the ozone and looks
food in a football uniform. Doctor is an excellent receiver and a better
line back er.
A<'d these to boys like Garrett. Cook. Rogers, Wedge, Don Sanders
(who will be eligible again next year). Morley, Steinberg, Bush, Gant,
Wilson, Goldberg. Krickeberg, Ai milage. Tanner. Howe. Monteith, Stanton.
Alathia Manoogian anil Carlson, and you have the makings of a good team.
Aiid. i('member Stanlord is eligible for the Rose Bowl next year.

We can't put this column to bed without paying just tribute to the I
other s'tar on the horizon, i.e.. the coaching staff.
Chuck Taylor's record speaks for itself. The youngest major college
coach in the country last year, he was selected "Coach of the Year." Again,
thi.- year, his team was supposed to wallow in fifth or sixth place. Right
now, it has a four and one record. Batting . BUO.
But Taylor is only the beginning. AI Masters said recently that this was
the best coaching staff Stanford has had in the 27 years he has been here, j
That lakes in a lot of territory when you look at names like Clark Shaugh
nessy and Pop Warner. But then when you look at Chuck's assistants, it's
understandable why Masters says this.
Dutch Feliring, Pete Kmetovic, George Lynn. Joe Ruetz. and Mai Elward '
are not only top coaches. They're top flight human beings. Ruetz
used to be head coach at St. Mary's, before it disbanded football and El
ward used to be head coach at Purdue. Fehring has turned down several
offers in order to remain at Stanford.
Also, Stanlord probably has the best educated coaching staff in the j
country. All have master's degrees. Dutch Fehring i.s working on his'
doctorate, which he plans to make into a Look, and Ruetz i.s getting a
doctorate in anthropology.

Gordon McKibben. who was editor of the Daily last year, wrote me the j
following quote from the mouth of Washington Coach Howie Odell: "With
Stanford you run into one of those outfits that deals in high spirit. Stan- !
lord i.s a wonderful private school, and it takes intelligent kids to get in
. . . it's hard to get into Stanford, you know. Now. a team with spirit is
a tough one to figure. Frankly, last year's championship Stanford team
was no belter than fourth, maybe fifth, in the conference as far as ma
terial went. But they won a couple of easy ones, then they yot up and
beat some tough ones, and by golly, those Stanford boys just got up and
decided they couldn't be beaten.
Ihev won ball games they had no business winning. They're always
tough. But we really needed the confidence today's landslide gave us and
we might be in a tough frame of mind ourselves next weekend."

We can't put this column to bed without paying just tribute to the I
other s'tar on the horizon, i.e.. the coaching staff.
Chuck Taylor's record speaks for itself. The youngest major college
coach in the country last year, he was selected "Coach of the Year." Again,
thi.- year, his team was supposed to wallow in fifth or sixth place. Right
now, it has a four and one record. Batting . BUO.
But Taylor is only the beginning. AI Masters said recently that this was
the best coaching staff Stanford has had in the 27 years he has been here, j
That lakes in a lot of territory when you look at names like Clark Shaugh
nessy and Pop Warner. But then when you look at Chuck's assistants, it's
understandable why Masters says this.
Dutch Feliring, Pete Kmetovic, George Lynn. Joe Ruetz. and Mai Elward '
are not only top coaches. They're top flight human beings. Ruetz
used to be head coach at St. Mary's, before it disbanded football and El
ward used to be head coach at Purdue. Fehring has turned down several
offers in order to remain at Stanford.
Also, Stanlord probably has the best educated coaching staff in the j
country. All have master's degrees. Dutch Fehring i.s working on his'
doctorate, which he plans to make into a Look, and Ruetz i.s getting a
doctorate in anthropology.

Gordon McKibben. who was editor of the Daily last year, wrote me the j
following quote from the mouth of Washington Coach Howie Odell: "With
Stanford you run into one of those outfits that deals in high spirit. Stan- !
lord i.s a wonderful private school, and it takes intelligent kids to get in
. . . it's hard to get into Stanford, you know. Now. a team with spirit is
a tough one to figure. Frankly, last year's championship Stanford team
was no belter than fourth, maybe fifth, in the conference as far as ma
terial went. But they won a couple of easy ones, then they yot up and
beat some tough ones, and by golly, those Stanford boys just got up and
decided they couldn't be beaten.
Ihev won ball games they had no business winning. They're always
tough. But we really needed the confidence today's landslide gave us and
we might be in a tough frame of mind ourselves next weekend."

Today, we're not going to write about the recent UCLA game or the
Washington game coming up. Or about C;.hn pro-ing it up with his
erasers or üboiit Marvin 0. Adams (see lettt rs to the editor) taking a shower
while waiting for tlu' traffic to thin out. Or about Zeke Wallace playing
"A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody" on his violin while the UCLA Queen
drives by. Or about Stanford losing its two best defensive men, Chuck j
Essegian and Hon Eadie.
Today, we iv looking for the silver lining in the future. We mean the j
future ltiture, not the immediate future.
Nobody has had the urge to say, "Wait til next year," but nevertheless, ;
the Indians should be loaded next season. Nor 11 Manoogian, the best
guard in the country, is saving his eligibility until next fall, having incurred i
i! knee injury beiore the first game this year. Dob Mathiax has another 1

Sweetest of all. Bob Ghilotli has soine great freshmen prospects this
year. The yearlings mutilated the UCLA frosh, 42 tu 0. Wight now. they're
saying nice things about a U foot, one inch 194 pound halfback named Jim
Truher. They're saying he's the best prospect to hit the Farm since a
_____ gangling kid named Bill McColl enrolled here.

Listen to Connie Jarvis. trainer and good guy.
"if you stuck this kid Truher in the 49er
dressing room, you couldn't tell the difference
between him and one of the pros. That's the
way he carries himself."
Truher does the 10() in !).8, is agile, power
ful, and a good pass receiver. He also kicks
ofl and can convert. He lias a blocking weak
ness light now. but frosh coach Bob Ghilotli
says. "He's not afraid of contact, and he'll
learn how to block."
Against UCLA. Truher only played the first
quarter. What did he do . . . just produce
touchdown gallops of ill) yards and (>2 yards.
Another hot prospect is John Stewart, a

[)' 3" glue-fingered end from Puly High.
Stewart, who also tallied twice against the Brubabes, is the Sam Morley !
typ<? of end and somewhat faster than Morley.
Another boy who should help the varsity out is linebacker Tom Me- '
Keima, a touuh aggressive Manoogian type of player. Fullback Bill Tarr. I
185 pounds, i.s a very hard runner and a good receiver. Joel Sappenlield
is the best of a good crop of guards and tackles. He i.s 200 pounds and
quick as a cat. An excellent blocker.
Another outstanding prospect is Steve Doctor, a 212 pound end from
Santa Barbara. He reaches six feet three inches into the ozone and looks
food in a football uniform. Doctor is an excellent receiver and a better
line back er.

Sweetest of all. Bob Ghilotli has soine great freshmen prospects this
year. The yearlings mutilated the UCLA frosh, 42 tu 0. Wight now. they're
saying nice things about a U foot, one inch 194 pound halfback named Jim
Truher. They're saying he's the best prospect to hit the Farm since a
_____ gangling kid named Bill McColl enrolled here.

Listen to Connie Jarvis. trainer and good guy.
"if you stuck this kid Truher in the 49er
dressing room, you couldn't tell the difference
between him and one of the pros. That's the
way he carries himself."
Truher does the 10() in !).8, is agile, power
ful, and a good pass receiver. He also kicks
ofl and can convert. He lias a blocking weak
ness light now. but frosh coach Bob Ghilotli
says. "He's not afraid of contact, and he'll
learn how to block."
Against UCLA. Truher only played the first
quarter. What did he do . . . just produce
touchdown gallops of ill) yards and (>2 yards.
Another hot prospect is John Stewart, a

[)' 3" glue-fingered end from Puly High.
Stewart, who also tallied twice against the Brubabes, is the Sam Morley !
typ<? of end and somewhat faster than Morley.
Another boy who should help the varsity out is linebacker Tom Me- '
Keima, a touuh aggressive Manoogian type of player. Fullback Bill Tarr. I
185 pounds, i.s a very hard runner and a good receiver. Joel Sappenlield
is the best of a good crop of guards and tackles. He i.s 200 pounds and
quick as a cat. An excellent blocker.
Another outstanding prospect is Steve Doctor, a 212 pound end from
Santa Barbara. He reaches six feet three inches into the ozone and looks
food in a football uniform. Doctor is an excellent receiver and a better
line back er.
A<'d these to boys like Garrett. Cook. Rogers, Wedge, Don Sanders
(who will be eligible again next year). Morley, Steinberg, Bush, Gant,
Wilson, Goldberg. Krickeberg, Ai milage. Tanner. Howe. Monteith, Stanton.

We can't put this column to bed without paying just tribute to the I
other s'tar on the horizon, i.e.. the coaching staff.
Chuck Taylor's record speaks for itself. The youngest major college
coach in the country last year, he was selected "Coach of the Year." Again,
thi.- year, his team was supposed to wallow in fifth or sixth place. Right
now, it has a four and one record. Batting . BUO.
But Taylor is only the beginning. AI Masters said recently that this was
the best coaching staff Stanford has had in the 27 years he has been here, j
That lakes in a lot of territory when you look at names like Clark Shaugh
nessy and Pop Warner. But then when you look at Chuck's assistants, it's
understandable why Masters says this.
Dutch Feliring, Pete Kmetovic, George Lynn. Joe Ruetz. and Mai Elward '
are not only top coaches. They're top flight human beings. Ruetz
used to be head coach at St. Mary's, before it disbanded football and El
ward used to be head coach at Purdue. Fehring has turned down several
offers in order to remain at Stanford.
Also, Stanlord probably has the best educated coaching staff in the j
country. All have master's degrees. Dutch Fehring i.s working on his'
doctorate, which he plans to make into a Look, and Ruetz i.s getting a
doctorate in anthropology.

Stanford you run into one of those outfits that deals in high spirit. Stan- !
lord i.s a wonderful private school, and it takes intelligent kids to get in
. . . it's hard to get into Stanford, you know. Now. a team with spirit is
a tough one to figure. Frankly, last year's championship Stanford team
was no belter than fourth, maybe fifth, in the conference as far as ma
terial went. But they won a couple of easy ones, then they yot up and
beat some tough ones, and by golly, those Stanford boys just got up and
