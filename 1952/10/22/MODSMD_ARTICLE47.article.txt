# Fire Chief Tells Need for Expansion
## Housing Area Is Inadequate 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
"It's rather small."
Stanford Fire Chief John Mar
ston surveyed his tiny office
with whimsical despair. File cab
inets, magazines, and timetables
were spread over almost every
available foot of floor and wall
space.
"And (hen there's this." His
finger pointed to a stack of equip
ment piled between the door and
his desk. "That's for Civilian De
fense Control. Stanford is a cen
ter for defense preparations, and
we have to take charge of the
material."
Chief Marston feels that the Stan
[ ford Fire Department needs an all -
I over expansion. Larger quarters
! are needed to store equipment and
to house the 14 students and six
full-time firemen who work for the
department.
"The crowded conditions are par
ticularly evident in the Troys' living
quarters," said Marston. "Eight of
the boys use one small study room,
six use another. And all of them
share one kitchenette."
"In spite of all this crowding," lie

concluded smiling, "we still have
a waiting list of 50 students wish
ing to work at the Firehouse.
Many grads apply."
The student firemen keep much of
the department's equipment in
working order. For being on call for
all campus fires, they receive room,
linen, and $20 a month. At the sound
of a whistle, they are permitted to
leave whatever classes they are in
and go to the scene of the fire.
Between fires the men have
weekly drills of operation of appa
ratus and equipment, and practice
handling the hose and ladders used
in fire-fighting.
Despite all their tasks, the Fire
house teams have found time to
win several intramural sports tro
phies, particularly in football.
Of the 126 alarms received by the
department in the academic year
1951-52, the large majority were due
to careless smoking. "That is the
cause of most of our said
the chief gravely.

He termed last year's .18 false
alarms "a headache and really very
serious. We run the risk of dam
aging equipment," he explained,
"and there is always the chance that
a real fire will start and we will be
out of x - each."
"However," he added cheerfully,
"we have had no major fires, for
which we feel ourselves very for
tunate. For that, I want to thank
the general co-operation of the
students who have supported the
Fire Department in matters of
fire safety. They have helped us
to maintain our good record for
many years."
Are fires glamorous? Not to the
firemen, said the chief. They are
"hard, miserable work." Behind
the scenes is the labor that must
go into maintaining equipment,
drilling and training men, keeping
quarters neat, cleaning up debris
after the fire is out, and writing up
fire reports.

The chief described many ad
vances in Fire Department equip
ment since 1880, when Leland Stan
ford brought the first hand-pumper
from Boston to protect his farm.
"All our major equipment has
been modernized since 1945, and
new items have been added." ex
plained Marston. Now we have
four major pieces and the chief's
car in use, besides the ladders,
hoses, and supplies.
Before Chief Marston came to the
Farm, he headed the Belmont Fire
Department. "I started out working
in the bank," he reminisces, "and
chased fires only as a volunteer.
But I didn't like bank work, too
confining, and when the Fire De
partment started paying its firemen
and offered me a job, I accepted."
Fires, according to Chief Mar
ston, arc always interesting. For
no two blazes are ever exactly
the same. As an example of a
recent unusual job, lie cited last
year's San Francisquito Creek
trrtfecty, in which a six-year-old
boy was drowned. The Stanford
Kire Department aided the Mcn
lo Park department in an all
night vigil.
The chief lives on campus within
easy reach of all alarms. Would he
do it all over again? Marston grins,
''I think so. I've been happy in my
work. And of my 25 years in the
fire service, my 10 years at Stan
ford have been the most rewarding
and interesting."
