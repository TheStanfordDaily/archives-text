# AFL Siege Enters Second Year
## 
### SUE WHEAT 
The picket who daily saunters
back and forth in front of the
Electric Kitchen et University
Ave and The Circle is beginning
to look like a permanent part of
the Palo Alto landscape.
It was a year ago today that the
AFL pickets took up their signs and
began the long seige in protest of
the shop's refusal to sign a union
"closed shop" contract.
Small, pleasant looking Mrs. Al
lcan Dacus, who with her son and

Free coffee and doughnuts will

house widen the Electric Kitchen
is holding in commemoration of Ihe
first anniversary of the picketing.
The gesture is one of appreciation
toward the shop's loyal customers
who have kept the business going
in spite of union difficulties.

daughter, leases and manages the
shop, explains her refusal to sign
the contract in this way: "I don't
believe in forcing people to do
things, and that includes joining
unions. I had nobody in the shop
who wanted to join the union." Mrs.
Dacus's answer to the union proposal
remains the same as it was a year
ago—a flat "no."
Strangely enough, the picket line
(which now consists of one man)
has not reduced trade. As a matter
of fact, according t*> Mrs. Dacus,
"business is better than ever." Al
though the Kitchen has lost union
customers, non-union sympathizers
who have continued to patronize

faces is the boycott imposed by other
unions. Under the boycott union
teamsters cannot deliver goods to the
shop. But determined little Mrs.
Dacus, with the help of her family
and friends does her own hauling
and delivering. She can not reveal
where she obtains her goods, since
the union could bring pressure to
bear on that distributor.
Relations between the pickets
and the shop owners arc surpris
ingly friendly. The pickets feel the
highest rcspect for Mrs. Dams;
she. <»n the other hand, feels sorry
frr the sign-toters who have to
stay on "in all kinds of weather."'
The pickcts are hired by the AFL
Local 180 for cooks and waitresses.
They are paid $1.30 an hour.
The picketing started on a 24-
hour-a-day basis, dropped to 18, then
16. Now the shop is picketed only
I 14 hours a day, from ft a.m. to 8 p.m.,
Sundays excluded. Two man, work
ing seven hours each constitute the
blockade.
Dozens of men have held the job
| but they usually slay on only a
short time. S.vvian Clark, cur
! rently holding down the afternoon
| shift has been on since April. He
seems Io enjoy his work and the
opportunity it gives him to meet
ii'*w people "just by seeing them
j everyday."
Clark's philosophy is summed up
in his statement, "I never get, mad
j at anybody." In this dispute, how
ever, he believes that the shop would
be better off if it joined the union.
The formal function of a picket is
to report union members who cross
the line to patronize an outlawed
place of business. So far, according
to Clark, no nfTenders have been
turned in.
