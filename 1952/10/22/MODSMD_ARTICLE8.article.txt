# TV Causes Gate Loss

### 
Television at the Michigan-Stan
ford football game on Oct. 4 cost
the "gate" $31,187, according to Al
Masters, athletic director.
"The combination of the World
Series plus the grid contest itself
on the TV screens rcduced our
crowd from its estimated normal of
(55,500 to 30,818 (actual attendance),"
said Masters.
"The 30,818 included 25,318 reg
ular reserved scat holders at $3.50
(including tax), and 5,500 stu
dents at $1.20. Tiie total "gate"
was $95,213. Our income from tel
evision was $102,500, 12 per cent
of which we must pay to the
NCAA, leaving us a net of $90,-
200. Thus, our total income from
ticket sales and television was
$185,413.
"It is my opinion that, without
TV, this game should have attracted
60,000 reserved scat buyers, plus the
5,500 students we had. (The same
two teams played to 77,000 here
three years ago.) That would have
produced $216,600 income."
Masters also pointed out that
one university might go two or
three years without getting one of
the eleven "master games" under
the present NCAA formula (Stan
ford-Michigan was one of those
"master games").
In such a case, that school's gate
receipts at one or more games might
be reduccd drastically by television
with no return from TV, or at best
a local release which would net
the university no more than $2,000
at the most.
"And in all this, we have not
taken into consideration the amount,
of .money the television of our game
cost others throughout America on
Oct. 4," concluded Masters.
