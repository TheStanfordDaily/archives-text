# Bitter Party Rages for Congress Control
## 
### HADLEY ROFF Daily Political Editor 
The Republicans ore waging an uphill battle for control of Congress
this campaign, but despite their strenuous efforts they still might be the
party of the "outs."
According to reports from across the nation, the voters are split about
50-50 in their preference for Congressional candidates. That figure is
considerably different than that reflected in the polls for President. In
the Presidential polls, General Dwight Eisenhower leads, 53% to 39%.
The outcome of the battle for the Senate is the most doubtful. Only
a sweeping victory by Eisenhower will insure the Republicans control
of the upper House, reports indicate.
Control of the House, it appears, will be determined by the outcome
of the Presidential race, regardless of the margin held by the winning
candidate.
The 435 seats in the House are in contest. In the Senate, the parties
are shaking the political dice for 35 seats.
To gain control of the Senate, the Republicans must add two seats to
their present roll call of 47.
With 1!) votes, the Republicans, along with the conservative Southern
Democrats, would be full masters of the upper House.
But gaining those two essential seats is not an easy task. For one
thing the Republicans must hold all the scuts they now have or, at least,
take an equal number.
In the present campaign, 21 Republican scats are in jeopardy. They
must be held at all costs. Aiul Republicans are sparing no horses in
the campaign drive.
General Eisenhower, in an unusual political move, has endorsed with
out qualification all Republican candidates.
Most presidential candidates hesitate to endorse flatly all party can
didates, fearing they might arouse unfavorable local reaction.
But Eisenhower, time and again, has urged GOP followers to vote
the Republican ticket "from top to bottom."

Such endorsement has drawn flaming criticism from the Democrats
and Repulbicans like Senator Wayne Morse of OVegon.
Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson has characterized several of
the Republican senatorial candidates as "reactionaries who have bad to
be dragged, kicking and screaming into the Twentieth Century."
Morse has indicated he agrees with that contention and has said he
fears Eisenhower has sold out to the "reactionary elements in Congress."
Republican strategists feel, however, that several of the more con
troversial of the GOP contenders can win only if pulled on the shirt tails
of the general.
Among the more controversial Republicans battling for retention
of their Senate seats arc James P. Kom of Missouri, Harry P. Cain of
Washington, and William E. Jenner of Indiana.
All have been outspoken champions of the opposition point of view
in Congress, and have led the fight against many of the foreign policy
plans of the presCSt administration.
With these three men may rest the possibility of Republican control
of the Senate during the next two years.
All are waging stiff campaigns, stumping their states, leveling scaring
blasts at the opposition.
But the Democrats are not at rest. In Missouri, Washington, and
Indiana, they have picked carefully, selecting candidates who best
reflect the thinking of the New and Fair Deals.
Stuart Symington, former Secretary for Air, is contending against Kcm.
He has been one of the chief champions of Truman's foreign policy.
Kcm, on the other hand, has been a bitter critic of the foreign
policy and has voted against the Atlahtic Pact, the Foreign Aid Bill,
the Mutual Security Act, the Marshall Plan, and the Japanese Peace
Treaty.
Kem said recently that John Foster Dulles and General Eisenhower
are "coming closer to my opinions than I am to theirs."
In Washington, Henry M. Jackson, 12-year veteran of the House, is
uposing C. Jackson is known as a straight-down-the-road New and

Fair Dealer.
Cain has a bewildering record in the Senate, and has not aroused
enthusiastic support from fellow Republicans this year.
I.ast year, Cain threw Congress into turmoil when hr introduced
two contradictory resolutions—one calling for the withdrawal of tb<-
United States from the Pacific and the other for the declaration of
all-out war on China.
Indiana's Jenner is meeting stiff opposition in the person of the state's
governor, Henry F. Shricker. Shricker, the only man to be twice elected
governor of Indiana, is known as a mild Fair Dealer. He has supported
most foreign policy stands of the present administration.
Jenner has urged the United States "remove the crutch in Europe and
Asia."
The Republican Senate hopefuls received a boost in morale two
months ago when Wisconsin's Joe McCarthy won the Republican nomi
nation of his state in a thumping primary victory.
Further encouragement, boomed from California in June when Senator
William F. Knowland won the nomination of both parties in one of the
greatest, election victories in the Golden State's history.
The Democrat incumbants fighting to hold their seats ore having
no easy time of it.. For four Southerh Senate candidates, the November
balloting is nothing but formality.
The other 10 candidates arc in danger. _
The Democrat in the most hot-water, perhaps, is Blair Moody of
Michigan.
William Benton of Connecticut, who has led the fight again; t McCarthy
in the Senate, also is in particular danger.
Both have been accused of Red syrnpathsizers, a telling charge con
sidering the election margin of Senator McCarthy.
The Democrats are battling hard to hold their slim majority in the
Senate. A loss of one seat will mean a tie. The loss of two seats will
mean GOP control—a possibility that rides with the political fortunes of
General Eisenhower.

With 1!) votes, the Republicans, along with the conservative Southern
Democrats, would be full masters of the upper House.
But gaining those two essential seats is not an easy task. For one
thing the Republicans must hold all the scuts they now have or, at least,
take an equal number.
In the present campaign, 21 Republican scats are in jeopardy. They
must be held at all costs. Aiul Republicans are sparing no horses in
the campaign drive.
General Eisenhower, in an unusual political move, has endorsed with
out qualification all Republican candidates.
Most presidential candidates hesitate to endorse flatly all party can
didates, fearing they might arouse unfavorable local reaction.
But Eisenhower, time and again, has urged GOP followers to vote
the Republican ticket "from top to bottom."

Such endorsement has drawn flaming criticism from the Democrats
and Repulbicans like Senator Wayne Morse of OVegon.
Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson has characterized several of
the Republican senatorial candidates as "reactionaries who have bad to
be dragged, kicking and screaming into the Twentieth Century."
Morse has indicated he agrees with that contention and has said he
fears Eisenhower has sold out to the "reactionary elements in Congress."
Republican strategists feel, however, that several of the more con
troversial of the GOP contenders can win only if pulled on the shirt tails
of the general.
Among the more controversial Republicans battling for retention
of their Senate seats arc James P. Kom of Missouri, Harry P. Cain of
Washington, and William E. Jenner of Indiana.
All have been outspoken champions of the opposition point of view
in Congress, and have led the fight against many of the foreign policy
plans of the presCSt administration.
With these three men may rest the possibility of Republican control
of the Senate during the next two years.
All are waging stiff campaigns, stumping their states, leveling scaring
blasts at the opposition.
But the Democrats are not at rest. In Missouri, Washington, and
Indiana, they have picked carefully, selecting candidates who best
reflect the thinking of the New and Fair Deals.
Stuart Symington, former Secretary for Air, is contending against Kcm.
He has been one of the chief champions of Truman's foreign policy.
Kcm, on the other hand, has been a bitter critic of the foreign
policy and has voted against the Atlahtic Pact, the Foreign Aid Bill,
the Mutual Security Act, the Marshall Plan, and the Japanese Peace
Treaty.
Kem said recently that John Foster Dulles and General Eisenhower
are "coming closer to my opinions than I am to theirs."
In Washington, Henry M. Jackson, 12-year veteran of the House, is
uposing C. Jackson is known as a straight-down-the-road New and

Fair Dealer.
Cain has a bewildering record in the Senate, and has not aroused
enthusiastic support from fellow Republicans this year.
I.ast year, Cain threw Congress into turmoil when hr introduced
two contradictory resolutions—one calling for the withdrawal of tb<-
United States from the Pacific and the other for the declaration of
all-out war on China.
Indiana's Jenner is meeting stiff opposition in the person of the state's
governor, Henry F. Shricker. Shricker, the only man to be twice elected
governor of Indiana, is known as a mild Fair Dealer. He has supported
most foreign policy stands of the present administration.
Jenner has urged the United States "remove the crutch in Europe and
Asia."
The Republican Senate hopefuls received a boost in morale two
months ago when Wisconsin's Joe McCarthy won the Republican nomi
nation of his state in a thumping primary victory.
Further encouragement, boomed from California in June when Senator
William F. Knowland won the nomination of both parties in one of the
greatest, election victories in the Golden State's history.
The Democrat incumbants fighting to hold their seats ore having
no easy time of it.. For four Southerh Senate candidates, the November
balloting is nothing but formality.
The other 10 candidates arc in danger. _
The Democrat in the most hot-water, perhaps, is Blair Moody of
Michigan.
William Benton of Connecticut, who has led the fight again; t McCarthy
in the Senate, also is in particular danger.
Both have been accused of Red syrnpathsizers, a telling charge con
sidering the election margin of Senator McCarthy.
The Democrats are battling hard to hold their slim majority in the
Senate. A loss of one seat will mean a tie. The loss of two seats will
mean GOP control—a possibility that rides with the political fortunes of
General Eisenhower.
The Republicans ore waging an uphill battle for control of Congress
this campaign, but despite their strenuous efforts they still might be the
party of the "outs."
According to reports from across the nation, the voters are split about
50-50 in their preference for Congressional candidates. That figure is
considerably different than that reflected in the polls for President. In
the Presidential polls, General Dwight Eisenhower leads, 53% to 39%.
The outcome of the battle for the Senate is the most doubtful. Only
a sweeping victory by Eisenhower will insure the Republicans control
of the upper House, reports indicate.
Control of the House, it appears, will be determined by the outcome
of the Presidential race, regardless of the margin held by the winning
candidate.
The 435 seats in the House are in contest. In the Senate, the parties
are shaking the political dice for 35 seats.

be dragged, kicking and screaming into the Twentieth Century."
Morse has indicated he agrees with that contention and has said he
fears Eisenhower has sold out to the "reactionary elements in Congress."
Republican strategists feel, however, that several of the more con
troversial of the GOP contenders can win only if pulled on the shirt tails
of the general.
Among the more controversial Republicans battling for retention
of their Senate seats arc James P. Kom of Missouri, Harry P. Cain of
Washington, and William E. Jenner of Indiana.
All have been outspoken champions of the opposition point of view
in Congress, and have led the fight against many of the foreign policy
plans of the presCSt administration.
With these three men may rest the possibility of Republican control
of the Senate during the next two years.
All are waging stiff campaigns, stumping their states, leveling scaring
blasts at the opposition.
But the Democrats are not at rest. In Missouri, Washington, and
Indiana, they have picked carefully, selecting candidates who best
reflect the thinking of the New and Fair Deals.
Stuart Symington, former Secretary for Air, is contending against Kcm.
He has been one of the chief champions of Truman's foreign policy.
Kcm, on the other hand, has been a bitter critic of the foreign
policy and has voted against the Atlahtic Pact, the Foreign Aid Bill,
the Mutual Security Act, the Marshall Plan, and the Japanese Peace
Treaty.
Kem said recently that John Foster Dulles and General Eisenhower
are "coming closer to my opinions than I am to theirs."
In Washington, Henry M. Jackson, 12-year veteran of the House, is
uposing C. Jackson is known as a straight-down-the-road New and

Fair Dealer.
Cain has a bewildering record in the Senate, and has not aroused
enthusiastic support from fellow Republicans this year.
I.ast year, Cain threw Congress into turmoil when hr introduced
two contradictory resolutions—one calling for the withdrawal of tb<-
United States from the Pacific and the other for the declaration of
all-out war on China.
Indiana's Jenner is meeting stiff opposition in the person of the state's
governor, Henry F. Shricker. Shricker, the only man to be twice elected
governor of Indiana, is known as a mild Fair Dealer. He has supported
most foreign policy stands of the present administration.
Jenner has urged the United States "remove the crutch in Europe and
Asia."
The Republican Senate hopefuls received a boost in morale two
months ago when Wisconsin's Joe McCarthy won the Republican nomi
nation of his state in a thumping primary victory.
Further encouragement, boomed from California in June when Senator
William F. Knowland won the nomination of both parties in one of the
greatest, election victories in the Golden State's history.
The Democrat incumbants fighting to hold their seats ore having
no easy time of it.. For four Southerh Senate candidates, the November
balloting is nothing but formality.
The other 10 candidates arc in danger. _
The Democrat in the most hot-water, perhaps, is Blair Moody of
Michigan.
William Benton of Connecticut, who has led the fight again; t McCarthy
in the Senate, also is in particular danger.
Both have been accused of Red syrnpathsizers, a telling charge con
sidering the election margin of Senator McCarthy.
The Democrats are battling hard to hold their slim majority in the
Senate. A loss of one seat will mean a tie. The loss of two seats will
mean GOP control—a possibility that rides with the political fortunes of
General Eisenhower.
The Republicans ore waging an uphill battle for control of Congress
this campaign, but despite their strenuous efforts they still might be the
party of the "outs."
According to reports from across the nation, the voters are split about
50-50 in their preference for Congressional candidates. That figure is
considerably different than that reflected in the polls for President. In
the Presidential polls, General Dwight Eisenhower leads, 53% to 39%.
The outcome of the battle for the Senate is the most doubtful. Only
a sweeping victory by Eisenhower will insure the Republicans control
of the upper House, reports indicate.
Control of the House, it appears, will be determined by the outcome
of the Presidential race, regardless of the margin held by the winning
candidate.
The 435 seats in the House are in contest. In the Senate, the parties
are shaking the political dice for 35 seats.
To gain control of the Senate, the Republicans must add two seats to
their present roll call of 47.
With 1!) votes, the Republicans, along with the conservative Southern
Democrats, would be full masters of the upper House.
But gaining those two essential seats is not an easy task. For one
thing the Republicans must hold all the scuts they now have or, at least,
take an equal number.
In the present campaign, 21 Republican scats are in jeopardy. They
must be held at all costs. Aiul Republicans are sparing no horses in
the campaign drive.
General Eisenhower, in an unusual political move, has endorsed with
out qualification all Republican candidates.
Most presidential candidates hesitate to endorse flatly all party can
didates, fearing they might arouse unfavorable local reaction.
But Eisenhower, time and again, has urged GOP followers to vote
the Republican ticket "from top to bottom."

Such endorsement has drawn flaming criticism from the Democrats
and Repulbicans like Senator Wayne Morse of OVegon.
