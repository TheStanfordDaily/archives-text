ous administration maxim that 'in
flation is the best policy'."
2. "The next step—after we have
a sane and honest economic program
again—will be to carry it out effi
ciently. We shall not allow our
government agencies to fight at the
expense of the American people."
:l. "The effective beginning of this

can effect substantial savings in our
huge defense program. We can have
more defense for less money."
