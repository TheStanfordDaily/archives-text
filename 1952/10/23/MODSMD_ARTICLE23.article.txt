# The 						Winds Are Still Blowing
## 
### 
We applaud the action of the group of Stan
ford faculty members who this week have stood
up and let themselves be counted on Ihe side of
their political beliefs.
In these days when tears of many kinds keep
men silent, it heartens to know that Stanford
faculty members can say what they think.
The professors took their stand knowing they
would likely be crificized for attaching the name
Stanford to political activity. We believe this
criticism is undeserved. Instead, we think the
Stanford family should be proud to let the
public know its members are free to think as
they like and to state their convictions publicly.
However, we feel that they should now and
in the future exercise extreme caution to make

it plain that they are a group of individuals and
not the faculty as a whole taking the stand. Wo
hope, too, that those professors who feel dif
terently will also make their views known.
To those of us who want more political in
terest on campus, this action by the professors
is a sign of progress. Coming so soon after the
beginning of political programs on campus,
their action gives new hope that Stanford is
becoming increasingly aware of its responsi
bility to the outside world.
The Daily as a whole does not support the j
particular political stand these men took, but it j
does support their right to take that stand. We
consider their action cheering evidence that
the winds of freedom are blowing as strongly
as ever.
