# BULL SESSION
## 
### SAM FRESHMAN 
On Tuesday Bob Stetson described a humorist as
man who feels bad but who feels good about it."
] uo not want to start an argument with my colteagne
Dr. Stetson (because lie would probably win it) but
I would like to take this oppor-

tunitv to state a tew simple tru
isms which everyone who agrees
with me will agree with.
First off a humorist does not
necessarily have to be a man.
This does not mean lhat he can
be a woman. Some of my friends
(former) believe that a Bull
Sessiorier can not be a humorist
Actually anybody can be a hu
morist, such as a small boy, man,

Republican, or aardvark.
In actuality he is one who does not laugh at his
own jokes but who can make other people laugh at
them ... or him. If anyone desires further informa
tion call Bob Stetson in Encina or consult Websters
Collegiate Dictionary.

Saw Chuck Kashima yesterday and we got to talk
ing about Big Game, guarding the campus against Cal
and Paly High, and building the big game bonfire.
Building the big game bonfire is one of'the oldest
and most keen inter-c-ass rivalries at Stanford and
each year the freshmen try to make their particular
fire the biggest one in the Farm's history. Remember
ing back to my own frosh days, we all got out to
the bed of Lake Lag and sweated it out trying to beat
the record heights of the classes in the twenties.
It was really great. There was lots of people, girls,
wood, girls, gasoline,'girls, confusion, and girls. There
were even girls from the University of Southern Cali
fornia (where they came from or where they went
nobody seems to know but while they were here, oh
boy!).
In case you're in the class of '5G and still haven't
got to the point what I'm telling you it not to miss
working on the bonfire.

Saw Chuck Kashima yesterday and we got to talk
ing about Big Game, guarding the campus against Cal
and Paly High, and building the big game bonfire.
Building the big game bonfire is one of'the oldest
and most keen inter-c-ass rivalries at Stanford and
each year the freshmen try to make their particular
fire the biggest one in the Farm's history. Remember
ing back to my own frosh days, we all got out to
the bed of Lake Lag and sweated it out trying to beat
the record heights of the classes in the twenties.
It was really great. There was lots of people, girls,
wood, girls, gasoline,'girls, confusion, and girls. There
were even girls from the University of Southern Cali
fornia (where they came from or where they went
nobody seems to know but while they were here, oh
boy!).
In case you're in the class of '5G and still haven't
got to the point what I'm telling you it not to miss
working on the bonfire.

On Tuesday Bob Stetson described a humorist as
man who feels bad but who feels good about it."
] uo not want to start an argument with my colteagne
Dr. Stetson (because lie would probably win it) but
I would like to take this oppor-

tunitv to state a tew simple tru
isms which everyone who agrees
with me will agree with.
First off a humorist does not
necessarily have to be a man.
This does not mean lhat he can
be a woman. Some of my friends
