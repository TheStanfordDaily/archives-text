Re: editorial on "Keeping Our Front Yard Clean"
Have you ever grabbed a cup of coffee in the
morning and proceeded on down the Quad —hoping
to make your class in time and also consume that
hot, black substance that"will keep you awake dur
ing class? Where to deposit that empty cup? Or
where do you throw away that ice cream wrapper
in the afternoon? Where does the Daily go when
you've finished reading it?
The answer at the present seems to be one of twef
choices. The little recepticles for throwing away your
cigarette stubs is a nice place to deposit those un
wanted papers . . . the chance for a little fire is an
interesting aspect too. Or if you are careful and sly,
you can let the bits of paper fall from your hand and
land (with due accuracy) in the bushes.
One little bit of scrap paper doesn't appear to leave
the campus messy . . . but multiply it by those
other papers you dropped during the day and by the
number of students and you have an interesting
number. These little bits of paper should fine! their
way into a wiste-pAper'Wntainer (its name explain
ing its function). This seems to be a reasonable rest
ing place for those bits of papa!
Would it hurt the beauty of the campus if there
were neat white paper recepticles (mounted on ce
ment blocks to insure their permency) located on the
corners of Quad and other suitable spots? Bits of
paper in the bushes ... or neat white containers?
The cost would probably be too much . . . com
pared to the many man hours that it must take to
keep the campus loking somewhat respectable! (It
might be considered a long-range investment that
would probably pay for itself monetarily in a few
years . . . not counting on the probable improvement
in the looks of the campus!)
Well . . . maybe they will give us colored coffee
cups so that when we dot the campus with our litter,
there will at least be a little beauty to it. Probably
no one will give us n chance to show that we have
a little pride left in how our campus looks ... by
providing wastepaper containers into which we may
slyly and carefully slip those little bits of paper!

Well . . . maybe they will give us colored coffee
cups so that when we dot the campus with our litter,
there will at least be a little beauty to it. Probably
no one will give us n chance to show that we have
a little pride left in how our campus looks ... by
providing wastepaper containers into which we may
slyly and carefully slip those little bits of paper!

To the Editor:
Re: editorial on "Keeping Our Front Yard Clean"
Have you ever grabbed a cup of coffee in the
morning and proceeded on down the Quad —hoping
to make your class in time and also consume that
hot, black substance that"will keep you awake dur
ing class? Where to deposit that empty cup? Or
where do you throw away that ice cream wrapper
in the afternoon? Where does the Daily go when
you've finished reading it?
The answer at the present seems to be one of twef
choices. The little recepticles for throwing away your
cigarette stubs is a nice place to deposit those un
wanted papers . . . the chance for a little fire is an
interesting aspect too. Or if you are careful and sly,
you can let the bits of paper fall from your hand and
land (with due accuracy) in the bushes.
One little bit of scrap paper doesn't appear to leave
the campus messy . . . but multiply it by those
other papers you dropped during the day and by the
number of students and you have an interesting
number. These little bits of paper should fine! their
way into a wiste-pAper'Wntainer (its name explain
ing its function). This seems to be a reasonable rest
ing place for those bits of papa!
Would it hurt the beauty of the campus if there
were neat white paper recepticles (mounted on ce
ment blocks to insure their permency) located on the
corners of Quad and other suitable spots? Bits of
paper in the bushes ... or neat white containers?
The cost would probably be too much . . . com
pared to the many man hours that it must take to
keep the campus loking somewhat respectable! (It
might be considered a long-range investment that
would probably pay for itself monetarily in a few
years . . . not counting on the probable improvement
in the looks of the campus!)
