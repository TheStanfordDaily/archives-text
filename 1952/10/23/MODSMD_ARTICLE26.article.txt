# 'An Indictment...'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I would like to pass on an observation which
amounts to an indictment of Stanford; namely, that
in four years at and around Stanford, I have never
seen a Negro. After a time one takes this rather
extraordinary situation for granted, forgetting that
Negroes make up one-tenth of the country's popula
tion. o
I would like to see a lot of Negroes here at Stan
ford; first., because I hate discrimination, which is
obviously operating now; second, because I think
Stanford should be more cosmopolitan; third—and
this is by far the most important — because the
simplest way to get rid of race prejudice on both
sides is for kids to live in the same dorms, go to the
same classes, get acquainted, and thus learn that race
is a lot less important than a lot of people think.
In order to get the program underway, we might
start out with a &.>w foreign scholarships from Mis
sissippi and Alabama.

(Editor's note: Reader Hornig unfortunately has
not met any of the numerous Negroes who have
attended Stanford — including the well known
hasketballer Eddie Tucker, who was a member of
ASSU Excom. To our knowledge, the University
has never singled Negroes out for special treatment
—either positive or negative—in its entrance re
quirements.)
