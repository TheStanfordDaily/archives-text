# POT SHOTS â€” Mike Hudson
## Offense vs. Defense 
### 
Qne hundred thousand sports
fa/is and physicists alike will
sojurn to the Los Angeles Coli
| seam this Saturday to watch a
' bloody brawl between California
! and US-C. The fans want to see
who is going to the Rose Bowl.
The physicists are interested in
'seeing just what will happen
when Cal's unstoppable
bumps heads v/ith USC's im
' movable line.
J
! Since Stanford unfortunately has
to lace USC's new herd and Cal's
new horde later in the season, let's
i take a look at these .squads.
Cal showed several weaknesses
In their wins over Missouri and
' Santa Clara, Their pa v s defense
looked only so- .o, despite the fact
that their opponents had no pass
ers. Quarterback Billy Mais' pass
ing is worse titan last year if
fMiShiblc, And what is most sur
prising, the usual Cal depth is
lacking. For instance, the three
reserve quartivbacks make up the
j first - string defensive backfield.
The second-string defensive back
field is the lirst-string offensive
running backs. In addition, Cal
! has only five ,',ood, healthy tackles,
two less than Stanford.
What the Bears do have is one o!
the most bruising ground attacks
ever seen on the Pacific Coast. Bill
| Powell's end sweep with Johnny
| Olszewski and running guard Tom

i; Dutton in front of him is a terrify
ing play. Olszew.-ki and Johnson
are a pair of ten-flat-hundred men
who can and do break loose all the
time. Then, when the oppo. ition
gets a little tired, Pappy inserts
speed-boy Paul Larson, who fat
tens up the score with his eight
yard burst j.
Offensive tackles Ralph Kreugei
and Don Curran, who was outstand
ing in year'.! Bi;>, Game, are
the real wheels that start the of
fense rolling.
USC has Leen playing 1930-3tyle
football, ani winning. Di?s Koch'.-
booming punts keep the opposition
in a hole until a fumble or an inter
i ception sets up a score. The de
fense has scored six tallies by them
selves and set up every other touch
i down.
Troy's middle* guard, Elmer
Wilhoite, is All-American caliber.
Oil' the gridiron, Wilhoite amuses
his friends with feats of strength.
What two men can't budge, Wil
hoite lifts uu. lie is Hanked by
t.vo more beasts, Bab Van Doren
and Bob Peviani.
USC's offense is as pitiful as the
defense is great. Three men alter
i natc at the key tailback post. Jim
Seal's is a good open lield runner,
but he isn't a good power runner
and he is a poor passer. A 1 Car
michael is another powerless fancy
dan and in his case a shoulder ail
ment has left him incapable of
I throwing a decent pass. Rudy Bo
lt ich is the best passer of the three,
but he is a "China doll" runner.
These three men have been unable
to spark a good drive all year, de
spite the booming blocking of
Ceorge Bozanic or 250-pound Char
ley Ane at blocking back.
What will happen when the
Bears, who average 429 yards pt*r
game, meet the Trojans, who have
only yielded 171 yards per game?
Our own feeling is that the im
movable object may be budged
a little.
There is a grimmer aspect to next
Saturday's proceedings. Last year
: the following Cal players were car
ried off the lield (in order of their
i disappearance): Sam Williams, John
Olszewski, John Peterson, Dick
LemMon, Ralph Kj euger, Harry
West, Don Robison, and John Pap-
I pa. Olszewski's exit with a twisted
; knee was accompanied by a wild
J cheer from the ti.UOO USC rooters,
i The word is out from Berkeley that
Cal is out for blood and Troy Ls al
i ways willing to accommodate. Next
Saturday's game may set sports
back 1.900 years to a time when
| other gladiators fought on the floor
I of another Coliseum before another
I bloodthirsty mob.
