# Breakers Nip El Toro, 2-0
## 
### WES MARX 
j Shutouts predominated in intra
i mural football action yesterday, as
I ten teams forgot to bring their scor
ing plays to the contests.
One 'of the ten was El Toro, which
j lost a hard-fought 2-0 game to the
i Breakers in the day's standout
game. The favored Breakers found
; El Toro to be tougher than expected
j early enough. In the first half Jim
Zarifes, the Breakers' big offensive
| threat, tossed an aerial from mid
j field, catching Dave Sachs inside the
! Toro ten. It only proved one of
j many scoring scares though, as Toro
! held firmly. Defensive end Chuck
Silverberg, who played a spirited
game for Toro, dove to put two
hands on Zarifes before the Breaker
man crossed the goal line unmo-
I lo.sted in the set of downs.
|
The game continued as Toro man
J Larry Calm would punt from inside
j his own ten back to midfield, where
the Breakers started all over again
getting only near-potential scores.
The game was nearing the overtime

i stage as LI loro gained possession
j of the ball on their one will) min
utes left. On the last play the
i Breakers' lime Weitzner broke into
| the end zone to catch a ball-han
dling El Toro back to win the game
| on a safety.
Phi Delta Phi couldn't solve the
I passes of Hay Swartz from ATO I.
as ATO copped a 25-0 conquest.
Swartz pitched four TD's, two of
them aimed at Jim Doody. With
; their captain, Clayton McGill, di
recting their attack from the side-
J lines, SAE I beat AKL 1 2U-7.
jMcGill, out with a stiff neck, let
Ted Riordan take over the team's
j passing duties as he threw to Fred
NeLson and Gene Katnick for two
j scores.
Delt I riddled V-20(i's defense
; with six scores as the Delts took an
easy 33-0 victory. Thw Village boys
had tfie most trouble with Fred
1 Aurel, who threw two touchdown
passes to Henry Baumgartner and
