# Elward Calls Washington 'Toughest Foe of the Year'
## 
### LOU PUJALET 
"Washington will be our toughest opponent of the season."
Such is the opinion of Assistant Coach Mai Elward, whose job
it is to, scout Stanford's opponents.
Elward said the Washington team, which took the field against
Oregon la3t Saturday, Wu3 "like a new club, showing plenty of
pop and holler." â™¦

in reviewing the Huskies' lories
.0 UCLA and Illinois on tuceossive
weekends, Elward sees it this way:
1. UCLA intercepted live oi Don
Hcinrich's aerials, and this more
thun anything else contribute.) Id
the Washington downfall, IJ2-7.
2. In Illinois' cue, the unlucky
Huskies fell behind, 21-0, in the
first period, which is just tou much
of a handicap to overcome.
Coach Chuck Taylor's stalwarts
will be facing the best pa: sing com
bination on the Coast, if not in the
nation, Saturday. Not only do the
Huskies have a great passer in
Heinrich, but they have three top
notch receivers in halfback Hill
Early and ends George Black and
Doug McClary.
Karly's worth was exemplified
against Oregon, when he was in
the tfiuiu* for only one plav, bill
that was all it took to pull down a
Heinrich pass for a touchdown.
Black, who stands G-5, and Mc-
Clary, even taller at C-8, will be two
of the best ends to face Stanford
this season. Elward emphatically
commented, "Our pass defense will

have more difficulty covering Wash
in ;ton'.s receivers than any others it
lu.s faced to date or will face later
in the season. It will be a great
challenge to the defensive unit: and
il they succeed in .slopping the Hus
kies' aerial circus, they can stop any
other passing twain."
It was Heinrich who heat Stan-
I'urd with his aerials, 21-7, during
the 1!I50 season and threw two
touchdown passes he t year as the
Card, won, 21-14.
Last Saturday Coach Howie Odell
fielded a new backlield with the
exception ol his quarterback, and
the Huskies di played a strong run
ning attack which completely sur
prised Oregon.
After seeing the movies of the
UCLA game, Elward believes that
Stanford may be "mad enough" to
avoid making the mistakes which
brought about their defeat to UCIxA.
