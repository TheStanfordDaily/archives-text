# Police Soft Spot: Co-operation
## 
### R.G. MANSFIELD 
Chief Gordon Davis of the
Stanford Police Department
swelled a few freshmen heads
last week. "Seems to be all fine
fellows in the new class," he
said. "The violations we have
had so far have not been by the
Class of '56, and in all our deal
ings with freshman we have
found them co-operative and
friendly."
Chief Davis has good reason to be
grateful for a little co-operation.
The Stanford Police Department,
with 12 men operating three radio
patrol cars and a motorcycle, must
control the movement of 4,000 or
more cars on campus this quarter,
besides performing routine enforce
ment duties. Add the number of
cars driven by visitors on campus,
and you begin to appreciate Chief
Davis's biggest problem.
'The trouble is that the drivers
of all those 4.000 cars insist on
taking them to class with them,"
said Davis. "They move them from
one corner of the Quad to another
between hours. The streets are
jammed with cars and pedestrians
every hour on the hour. If we
had a fire or a baa accident, we'd

have to clear the streets before
we could move."
Nine men work a 24-hour day in
two patrol cars on campus, while
two men with a patrol car work at
the Village. All patrol cars are
equipped with three - way radio
communication for efficient dis
patching. The department's motor
cycle is ixsed on campus for check
ing parking violations. Passing out
parking tags is by far the depart
ment's biggest job.
"A parking tag costs the driver
only $2," Davis pointed out, "but
still some violators just don't turn
up to pay their fines. If their car
hasn't been registered previous
ly, we charge them an extra dol
lar for registration. That's all. But
one driver on campus now has 12
tags outstanding, and another one
has picked up five already this
quarter, two in one day.
"No, wc don't slap them for not
paying immediately. In extreme
cases, we might recommend to
Men's Council that driving privi
leges on campus be denied some
specific parties, but we do not often
take that step."
Chief Davis mentioned that car
registration will remain open free
the rest of this week, ending tomor
row. After tomorrow registration
will cost $1. A total of 1,522 automo
biles have been registered already
this year, in addition to cars already
registered from previous years. All
cars which will be on campus reg
ularly this year should be regis
tered as soon as possible, Chief
Davis said.
"Sometimes we gel funny sto
ries when we tap somebody for a
registration fee late in the year,"
said Davis. "One guy thought he
should get his registration free
because he had just run home
over the weekend to get his car.
He lived in Phoenix, Arizona. He
paid."
Traffic control does not take up
all the time of the Police Depart
ment. One officer has the job of
keeping an eye on Toyon, Stern,
and Encina Halls at night. He turns
off the lights at certain hours, and
circulates between the dormitories
as a general enforcement officer. He
and other members of the force
keep a constant watch out for car
vandals in University parking areas.
These "car clouters" occasionally
make trouble on campus.
Police officers are also detailed to
keep the peace and control noise,
for instance at Encina Hall. "Over
there, it's a case of a very few mak
ing it hard for a lot of other fel
lows," said Chief Davis.
The Stanford Police Department
.recently had to cope with vandal
ism in Encina and Toyon Halls.
The Encina incident, which broke
Oct. 11, involved four youths from
Bay Area colleges. At Toyon.
three sailors and a Toyon resident
vvc c implicated in a brief show
of over-cxubcration.
Chief Davis repeated that traffic
problems are the biggest headache
of the department. One possible
solution would be to block off the
whole Quad area, as far away as
the Post Office on the south side, to
automobile traffic. Fines could be
raised. Driving privileges could be
suspended. None of these steps has
been taken, but Chief Davis empha
sized that if conditions get any
worse, something of this sort will be
done, in the interest of all.

Chief Gordon Davis of the
Stanford Police Department
swelled a few freshmen heads
last week. "Seems to be all fine
fellows in the new class," he
said. "The violations we have
had so far have not been by the
Class of '56, and in all our deal
ings with freshman we have
found them co-operative and
friendly."
Chief Davis has good reason to be
grateful for a little co-operation.
The Stanford Police Department,
with 12 men operating three radio
patrol cars and a motorcycle, must
control the movement of 4,000 or
more cars on campus this quarter,
besides performing routine enforce
ment duties. Add the number of
cars driven by visitors on campus,
and you begin to appreciate Chief
Davis's biggest problem.
'The trouble is that the drivers
of all those 4.000 cars insist on
taking them to class with them,"
said Davis. "They move them from
one corner of the Quad to another
between hours. The streets are
jammed with cars and pedestrians
every hour on the hour. If we
had a fire or a baa accident, we'd

have to clear the streets before
we could move."
Nine men work a 24-hour day in
two patrol cars on campus, while
two men with a patrol car work at
the Village. All patrol cars are
equipped with three - way radio
communication for efficient dis
patching. The department's motor
cycle is ixsed on campus for check
ing parking violations. Passing out
parking tags is by far the depart
ment's biggest job.
"A parking tag costs the driver
only $2," Davis pointed out, "but
still some violators just don't turn
up to pay their fines. If their car
hasn't been registered previous
ly, we charge them an extra dol
lar for registration. That's all. But
one driver on campus now has 12
tags outstanding, and another one
has picked up five already this
quarter, two in one day.
"No, wc don't slap them for not
paying immediately. In extreme
cases, we might recommend to
Men's Council that driving privi
leges on campus be denied some
specific parties, but we do not often
take that step."
Chief Davis mentioned that car
registration will remain open free
the rest of this week, ending tomor
row. After tomorrow registration
will cost $1. A total of 1,522 automo
biles have been registered already
this year, in addition to cars already
registered from previous years. All
cars which will be on campus reg
ularly this year should be regis
tered as soon as possible, Chief
Davis said.
"Sometimes we gel funny sto
ries when we tap somebody for a
registration fee late in the year,"
said Davis. "One guy thought he
should get his registration free
because he had just run home
over the weekend to get his car.
He lived in Phoenix, Arizona. He
paid."
Traffic control does not take up
all the time of the Police Depart
ment. One officer has the job of
keeping an eye on Toyon, Stern,
and Encina Halls at night. He turns
off the lights at certain hours, and
circulates between the dormitories
as a general enforcement officer. He
and other members of the force
keep a constant watch out for car
vandals in University parking areas.
These "car clouters" occasionally
make trouble on campus.
Police officers are also detailed to
keep the peace and control noise,
for instance at Encina Hall. "Over
there, it's a case of a very few mak
ing it hard for a lot of other fel
lows," said Chief Davis.
The Stanford Police Department
.recently had to cope with vandal
ism in Encina and Toyon Halls.
The Encina incident, which broke
Oct. 11, involved four youths from
Bay Area colleges. At Toyon.
three sailors and a Toyon resident
vvc c implicated in a brief show
of over-cxubcration.
Chief Davis repeated that traffic
problems are the biggest headache
of the department. One possible
solution would be to block off the
whole Quad area, as far away as
the Post Office on the south side, to
automobile traffic. Fines could be
raised. Driving privileges could be
suspended. None of these steps has
been taken, but Chief Davis empha
sized that if conditions get any
worse, something of this sort will be
done, in the interest of all.

the Post Office on the south side, to
automobile traffic. Fines could be
raised. Driving privileges could be
suspended. None of these steps has
been taken, but Chief Davis empha
sized that if conditions get any
worse, something of this sort will be
done, in the interest of all.

Chief Gordon Davis of the
Stanford Police Department
swelled a few freshmen heads
last week. "Seems to be all fine
fellows in the new class," he
said. "The violations we have
had so far have not been by the
Class of '56, and in all our deal
ings with freshman we have
found them co-operative and
friendly."
Chief Davis has good reason to be
grateful for a little co-operation.
The Stanford Police Department,
with 12 men operating three radio
patrol cars and a motorcycle, must
control the movement of 4,000 or
more cars on campus this quarter,
besides performing routine enforce
ment duties. Add the number of
cars driven by visitors on campus,
and you begin to appreciate Chief
Davis's biggest problem.
'The trouble is that the drivers
of all those 4.000 cars insist on
taking them to class with them,"
said Davis. "They move them from
one corner of the Quad to another
between hours. The streets are
jammed with cars and pedestrians
every hour on the hour. If we
had a fire or a baa accident, we'd

have to clear the streets before
we could move."
Nine men work a 24-hour day in
two patrol cars on campus, while
two men with a patrol car work at
the Village. All patrol cars are
equipped with three - way radio
communication for efficient dis
patching. The department's motor
cycle is ixsed on campus for check
ing parking violations. Passing out
parking tags is by far the depart
ment's biggest job.
"A parking tag costs the driver
only $2," Davis pointed out, "but
still some violators just don't turn
up to pay their fines. If their car
hasn't been registered previous
ly, we charge them an extra dol
lar for registration. That's all. But
one driver on campus now has 12
tags outstanding, and another one
has picked up five already this
quarter, two in one day.
"No, wc don't slap them for not
paying immediately. In extreme
cases, we might recommend to
Men's Council that driving privi
leges on campus be denied some
specific parties, but we do not often
take that step."
Chief Davis mentioned that car
registration will remain open free
the rest of this week, ending tomor
row. After tomorrow registration
will cost $1. A total of 1,522 automo
biles have been registered already
this year, in addition to cars already
registered from previous years. All
cars which will be on campus reg
ularly this year should be regis
tered as soon as possible, Chief
Davis said.
"Sometimes we gel funny sto
ries when we tap somebody for a
registration fee late in the year,"
said Davis. "One guy thought he
should get his registration free
because he had just run home
over the weekend to get his car.
He lived in Phoenix, Arizona. He
paid."
Traffic control does not take up
all the time of the Police Depart
ment. One officer has the job of
keeping an eye on Toyon, Stern,
and Encina Halls at night. He turns
off the lights at certain hours, and
circulates between the dormitories
as a general enforcement officer. He
and other members of the force
keep a constant watch out for car
vandals in University parking areas.
These "car clouters" occasionally
make trouble on campus.
Police officers are also detailed to
keep the peace and control noise,
for instance at Encina Hall. "Over
there, it's a case of a very few mak
ing it hard for a lot of other fel
lows," said Chief Davis.
The Stanford Police Department
.recently had to cope with vandal
ism in Encina and Toyon Halls.
The Encina incident, which broke
Oct. 11, involved four youths from
Bay Area colleges. At Toyon.
three sailors and a Toyon resident
vvc c implicated in a brief show
of over-cxubcration.
Chief Davis repeated that traffic
problems are the biggest headache
of the department. One possible
solution would be to block off the
whole Quad area, as far away as
