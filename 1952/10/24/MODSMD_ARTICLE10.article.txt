## 226 Teachers Sign Petition For Stevenson 
### 
Two hundred and twenty six
members of the Stanford faculty
and teaching staff have signed
the petition endorsing the candi
dacy of Democratic nominee
Adlai Stevenson.
The petition will be published this
afternoon in the Palo Alto Times in
a full-page advertisement. Circula
tion of the petition on campus began
Tuesday and ended yesterday.
Included in the petition signers
were many top professors, including
Albert H. Bowker, head of the sta
tistics department, John David Go
heen, head of philosophy, Hubert
Crouse Heffner, speech and drama,
Leonard Schiff, physics, Edward S.
Shaw, economics. Cart B. Spaeth,
Dean of the Law School, Gabor
Szego, head of mathematics, and
Virgil Whitaker, English.
The number signing the petition
represents almost one-fifth of the
faculty and teaching staff. Though
the Director of Information, Pete
Allen, first informed the Daily
there were X4O teaching members
of the faculty, he has revised that
figure to 1,217. That figure includes
teaching assistants and instructors
as well as (he three grades of pro
fessor. The figure does not in
clude administration workers.
Only those University employees
actually engaged in teaching were
allowed to sign the petition.
Dr. Arthur F. Wright, associate
professor of history, who directed
circulation of the petition, said yes
terday response to the move was
"most gratifying." He pointed out
that the opinions of those signing
the petition in no way reflects the
attitude of the entire faculty.
Ihe petition was the same as
that circulated at Columbia Uni
versity last week. It praises the
administrative record of Adlai
Stevenson while governor of Illi
nois and charges that Republican
candidate General Dwight Eisen
hower has endorsed his party's
so-called reactionary wing.
The petition asserts that Eisen
hower has whole-heartedly em
braced Senators Robert A. Taft
(Ohio), Joseph McCarthy (Wiscon
sin), and William E.' Jenner (In
diana), who, the petition implies,
are an "undesirable element."
Since the petition was first re
vealed. scores of letters and tele
phone calls have been received by
the President's office on campus.
Most of the letters and calls pro
test the actiqn of the professors,
complaining that those associated
with Stanford have no right to in
volve the University's name in
politics.
According to professors long at
tached to Stanford, the scale of en
dorsement for Stevenson is un
precedented in campus history. Most
say that never before have one
fifth of the faculty and staff de
clared for one candidate.
