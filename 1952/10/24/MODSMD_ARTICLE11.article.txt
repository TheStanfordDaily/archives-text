Dr. Thomas S. Barclay, professor
of political science, cut to the heart
of campaign issues yesterday when
he talked to 250 students and fac
ulty members in the Women's Club
house.
Dr. Barclay, who attended the
Republican and Democratic con
ventions this year and who teaches
Basic Factors in American Politics,
said both General Dwight Eisen
hower and Adlai Stevenson have
modified their :tands since the out
set of the campaign.
He said Eisenhower has two
groups of advisers: one, a group of
politicians who supported him be
fore the July convention, and the
other, the followers of Senator Rob
ert A. Taft.
He said he did not know which
group wiek's the most influence.
Stevenson, too, has had to modify
his views to satisfy various elements
in his party, Dr. Barclay pointed
out. He cited, however, Stevenson's
battle to cast off the stigma of boss
ism.
Following his talk, Dr. Barclay
asked for questions from the floor.
One of the first was, "Would a Re
publican victory mean a major
change in policy?"
Dr. Barclay thought not, recalling
the record of the Republican 80th
Congress which did nothing to sub
stantially "overturn the New Deal."
Asked about the Columbia peti
tion recently circulated on campus,
he said, "It hurts my professional
pride." He thought it too long and
too wordy.
