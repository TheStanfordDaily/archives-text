# Banners Must Be Removed
## 
### 
Several campus residences have
been notified to take down their
campaign banners under the ruling
against partisan political advertise
ments on University buildings.
The regulation also prohibits spe
cial meetings, publicity stunts, or
the use of public address systems
for partisan political purposes.
Individual students may put up
posters inside their residences pro
vided that a majority of the resi
dents do not object.
The ruling is administered by the
Public Relations Committee, chair
manned by Nancy Clark.
