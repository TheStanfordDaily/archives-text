### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
Today is United Nations Day.
Seven years ago, a charter
was drawn up by representa
lives of 50 countries, ratified,
and the UN became a growing
concern.
To celebrate United Nations
?)a,y in particular, and UN Work
in general, the IJN Friurational
Center, a branch of the lIR, is
presenting displays and a carillon
concert.
Displays of pamphlets and docu
ments relating In the United Na
tions and its work are being f-hown
at the Hoover Library, Stanford
Bookstore, and the downstairs foyer
of the Main Library.
All of the material used in the
displays comes from the Pamphlet
and Document Library, a subcom
mittee of the UN Educational Cen
ter, which is under the direction of
Roger Schwartz.
The Hoover Tower carillon will
ring out from 4 to p.m. to
pay tribute to the United Nations
anniversary day. Tunes to be
heard an- e from the Russian "In
ternational" to the national an
them of Nationalist China.
Songs of Franee, Croat Britain,
Estonia, Greece, Australia, Brazil.
Belgium, and the United States will
be played, together with Stanford's
Alma Mater.
This year's slogan for UN Week

(chosen by the American Associa
tion for the United Nations) is "Our
Best Hope for Peace is UN Plus
You." The AAUN's purpose in se
lecting a week out of the year and
designating it as UN Week is to
urge the people of tlie United States
to Rive thoughtful attention to the
major items of the agenda of the
General A sembly and to the role of !
the United States.
"There's a VoU in the United
Nations" was the catchword in
1847, and in 1!)4,X the slogan pro
claimed, "We Can Work It Out
Together or Fight H Out Alone."
A new era was seen in 1949. with
the UN credited with real political
achievements as well as the many
economic and social advances on its
score card. "The UN Works for
You" was the credo of UN Week
that year.
In the present, slogan was
adopted and has been carried on
ever :ince.
In a statement, relating to United
Nations Day, 1952, Trygvc Lie, Sec
retary-General of the United Na
tions, declared, "Today, amid eon
flict and fear of war, we need the J
United Nations more than ever. Let I
us Hive it every possible support,
not only on United Nations Day j
but in the days and years to come.
If we do, we can in our lifetime
build firmly for a world order of
universal peace and lasting secu
rity."
