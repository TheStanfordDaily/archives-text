### MIKE HUDSON 
The aerial circus is coming i
town. One of collegiate foot
ball's greatest showman, Don
Heinrich, and his trained Hus
kies will invade Stanford Sta
dium tomorow at 2 p.m.
Two years ago, Heinrich put on
! a spectacular show as he bombed
1 Stanford out of the Hose Bowl lace.
: Heinrich broke PCC records and
| Stanford hearts witli equal abandon
as he connected on 19 out of 24
passes for 243 yards and two touch
downs.
An overzealous sill) put Hein
j rich out of commission last year,
hut this year hp is better than
ever. He is hopelessly outdistanc
ing the rest of the nation in pass
ing. His 72 completions en 141
passes for 919 yards lead the na
tion. A good day tomorrow might
help him better his own national
j mark of 134 completions in a spa
son.
Heinrich is helped along by a
J quartet of great receivers. Six foot
eight inch Doug McClary handle
the short passes, while speedy 6' ■>"
George Black or (V 2" Phil Gill)
handle the longer tosses. The ber, 1 .

The freshmen will plav the
powerful Santa Clara fro:»h at II
a.m. tomorrow in the Stadium.
Frosh rooters will meet at 10:1 ■»
for a prc-game rally in the Encina
lounge. There will be an organ
izer! rooting section at (he game.

receiver of all is halfback Bill Early
Early, like Heinrich, has been fn:ht
ing off the injury bug all through
his career, but he should be in pretty
good shape tomorrow.
Last week, Washington un
veiled a sparkling running attack
to go with their air game as (hey
trampled over Oregon, 49 to '»
Fullback Jack Nugent is a
hard-hitter, while Frank Lariza
and Jack Kyllingsfad are speed
boys.
The hot-and-cold Huskies bav?
won three and lost two. They looked
great, in defeating Idaho, Minnesota,
and Oregon, but they were racked
up by Illinois 48 to 13 and UCLA,
32 to G. Before trying to evaluate
Washington, consider the following
scores. Washington 10, Minnesota
14 —Minnesota 13, Illinois V—Illino; .
48 Washington 13.
Chuck Taylor predicts his C arris
to win as usual. Asked whether he
thought it would be a high or low
scoring game, Taylor replied that
he hoped it would be a high-scor
ing game for Stanford and a low
scoring for Washington. He said
Washington was a tough foe. but
then so is every team left 011 the
schedule.
The Stanford defenge has been
hurt by the losses of linebacker
Chuck Essegian and end Ron Eadie.
The defensive backfield of Bob
Thompson, Joe St. Genie, and Bill
Monteith is in good shape, however.
It will be up to them and a hard
charging Card line to slow down

Heinrich's hurricane passing.
The hot-and-cold Washington de
fense has been hurt by the loss of
All-American' Dick Sprague. Illinois
tossed six touchdown passes over
the Husky backheld and Bob Gar
rett might have similar luck against
the northmen. Tomorrow's battle
should be a real passing dual.
Another close contest is on tap ;
when the spectacular Stanford ;
Frosh meet Santa Clara at 11:00 ;
a.m. Santa Clara defeated Treas- !
ure Island and Treasure Island j
deefated the Cal Ramblers. Trans- j
lated into English, this means that I
Santa Clara's Frosh are also !
powerful.
