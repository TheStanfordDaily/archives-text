# A
						Faculty Indictment
## 
### 
In this evening's Palo Alto Times, 226 mem
bers of the Stanford faculty (relatively, a small
percentage of the entire faculty) plan to dis
close their petition criticizing Dwight Eisen
hower and backing Adlai Stevenson. From the
release that we have, it appears these members
of the faculty are making their indictment of
Elsenhower and the Republicans.
We say this because they condemn Eisen
hower for selling out to "undesirable elements"
and because he has been "wrong on most of
the crucial questions before him."
They continue in thfeir indictment: "He has
been wrong on his wavering foreign policy
pronouncements, wrong on tidelands oil, wrong
on civil rights, wrong in surrendering to Taft,
wrong in absolving Nixon, wrong in embracing
Jenner, wrong in accepting McCarthy." And
their denunciations continue at length.
We are given to understand that the faculty
and staff of Stanford University has been
formed of intelligent men; men who are not apt
to make snap judgments, men who are respon
sible in their decisions. And we believe that
on the whole the faculty lives up to our impres
sion.
However, we cannot honestly believe that
those lew faculty members who signed this
petiiion meet the standards which we, per
haps idealisticaly, have set for our educators.
We do not believe that they fully realize the
import of what they have signed.
We need cite but one example of what they
have said to explain our opinion in this case.
Dwight Eisenhower said on October 9 in Los
Angeles, on the problem of civil rights; "We
must make equality of opportunity a living fact
for every American, regardless of race, color,
or creed. ... I am for wiping out every in
equality of opportunity right in the Nation's
capital as well as in every operation, military
and civil, of our Federal government."
Adlai Stevenson said in New York on August
29, on the same problem: "It (civil rights) means
the right to be treated equally before the law.
It means the right to equal opportunity for edu
cation, employment and decent living condi

tions. It means that none of these rights shall
be denied because of race or color or creed."
And our professorial backers for Stevenson
have declared for all the public to see, "Eisen
hower is wrong on civil rights!"
Unless our logic is extremely inadequate,
we do not see a difference of opinion between
the two candidates on this question—if lke*is
wicng, then as we see it, Stevenson must also
be wrong and we're in doubt as to just what
the signers of this petition do favor.
This we cite as one example why we have
doubts in our mind whether our professors
meant what they have signed. We do not deny
their right to say it, as long as it does not trans
gress the University policy set forth by the
Trustees; but we do question their judgment in
making the statenlent they have issued. They
have perhaps made an indictment of them
selves.
To further clarify our views on this subject,
we plan to issue a series of editorials answer
ing the specific charges made against the Re
publican candidate by these members of the
faculty. The first of this series will appear in
Monday's Daily and will deal with the charge
that Eisenhower has sold out to "undesirable
elements."
More specifically, we will explain why we
cannot go along with the Democratic propa
ganda of an Eisenhower "surrender" to Robert
Taft. We feel these charges cannot go un
answered, and we cannot help but challenge
the judgment of a few of our faculty who signed
this petition.—Walt Menninger
