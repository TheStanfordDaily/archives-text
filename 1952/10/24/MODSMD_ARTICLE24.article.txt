# Contrast in Smear
## 
### 
It is very interesting, in a way sardonic, that
certain individuals should be smearing Dwight
Eisenhower these days with charges of anti
semitism and anti-Catholicism.
Only last spring irresponsible groups were
attempting to defame Ike with such titles as
"Ike from Israel."
Neither could be more incorrect and neither
could be more unprincipled in the way of po
litical argumentsâ€”Jim Madison.
