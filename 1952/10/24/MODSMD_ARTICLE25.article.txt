# Banners Hauled In
## 
### 
Unlike the winds of freedom, campaign ban
ners are no longer blowing over the campus.
"Yesterday, the Public Relations Committee
warned several residences that all campaign
banners and posters must be removed from the
outside of their buildings.
Administration policy states that no partisan
political advertising may appear on the outside
of University buildings. This is to insure the
University as a non-partisan institution—a pre
requisite of academic freedom and objective
teaching.
However, within residences individuals may

express their preferences by campaign pesters
or other devices—providing a majority of the
residents do not object.
This policy lines up squarely with Stanford's
traditional independent scheme of things. We
do not feel that campaign propaganda is a sign
of the political consciousness on campus any
more than that the posters contribute anything
to the landscape. Furthermore, we believe that
expression of opinion is a long way from being
stifled by such realistic, cornmon-sense action.
