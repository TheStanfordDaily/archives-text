# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
I would like you to meet Sydney. Sydney is a
girl. She is two months old and has a crew cut.
Sydney is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Len
Mayrhofer, the latter who plays a lot of offensive
football for Stanford every Saturday. And Sydney
is also the subject of my observation for child psych.
Now, I am in favor of babies. I think that
are necessary for the survival of the human race
and for the makers of Pablum.

And I am all in favor of Sydney.
Sydney is a nice baby as babies
go. But somehow or other, I fail
to get too enthused about babies.
To me, they are always some
thing that slobbers at both ends.
Dr. Orr, the child psych prof,
threw a bomb into the laps of the
child psych class the very first
day the students showed up,
wagging their reg lines behind
them.

"Okay, Bang," she said (I am paraphrasing what
she said), "You're all supposed to turn in half-hour
to hour-long observations on infants. Take down
every action they make and then interpret it."
Now, this is a helluva assignment. I admit to
covering a lot of varied subjects in my undistin
guished career as a moulder of public opinion, but

never has the managing editor submitted me to the
ignominy of doing a play-by-play account of the
actions of a two month old baby with a crew cut.
I first met Sydney the day after the UCLA game.
It was on the plane transporting the football team
back to Stanford. The plane almost never got off
the ground. The stewardess noticed that there were
quite a few heavy gentlemen on the airship and
went up the aisle and took a weight check. Sydney
didn't add much to the total weight. She tips the
scales at nine pounds, 206 pounds less than her
daddy.
At 12:25 jMn. the observation began. At 12:2(5,
she began kicking her legs. I recorded this in my
play-by-play, first down and ten to go. But the
interpretation threw me for a loss. I fail to read
any inner significance into a baby with a crew rut
kicking her legs.
At 12:27, she made an acid expression, like some
one told her that she got the highest C+ in the class
or something, and then she began to cry. Why she
was crying I don't know. What with Adlai and Ike
saying unnice things about each other, gentlemen
shooting at other gentlemen in Korea, and Stanford
losing a football game, it's understandable why any
one would cry. I wrote it off to wet diapers.
At 1:03 p.m. I concluded the observation and left
Sydney. Slobbering at both ends.

any inner significance into a baby with a crew rut
kicking her legs.
At 12:27, she made an acid expression, like some
one told her that she got the highest C+ in the class
or something, and then she began to cry. Why she
was crying I don't know. What with Adlai and Ike
saying unnice things about each other, gentlemen
shooting at other gentlemen in Korea, and Stanford
losing a football game, it's understandable why any
one would cry. I wrote it off to wet diapers.
At 1:03 p.m. I concluded the observation and left
Sydney. Slobbering at both ends.

I would like you to meet Sydney. Sydney is a
girl. She is two months old and has a crew cut.
Sydney is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Len
Mayrhofer, the latter who plays a lot of offensive
football for Stanford every Saturday. And Sydney
is also the subject of my observation for child psych.
Now, I am in favor of babies. I think that
are necessary for the survival of the human race
and for the makers of Pablum.

And I am all in favor of Sydney.
Sydney is a nice baby as babies
go. But somehow or other, I fail
to get too enthused about babies.
To me, they are always some
thing that slobbers at both ends.
Dr. Orr, the child psych prof,
threw a bomb into the laps of the
child psych class the very first
day the students showed up,
wagging their reg lines behind
them.

"Okay, Bang," she said (I am paraphrasing what
she said), "You're all supposed to turn in half-hour
to hour-long observations on infants. Take down
every action they make and then interpret it."
Now, this is a helluva assignment. I admit to
covering a lot of varied subjects in my undistin
guished career as a moulder of public opinion, but

never has the managing editor submitted me to the
ignominy of doing a play-by-play account of the
actions of a two month old baby with a crew cut.
I first met Sydney the day after the UCLA game.
It was on the plane transporting the football team
back to Stanford. The plane almost never got off
the ground. The stewardess noticed that there were
quite a few heavy gentlemen on the airship and
went up the aisle and took a weight check. Sydney
didn't add much to the total weight. She tips the
scales at nine pounds, 206 pounds less than her
daddy.
At 12:25 jMn. the observation began. At 12:2(5,
she began kicking her legs. I recorded this in my
play-by-play, first down and ten to go. But the
interpretation threw me for a loss. I fail to read
any inner significance into a baby with a crew rut
kicking her legs.
