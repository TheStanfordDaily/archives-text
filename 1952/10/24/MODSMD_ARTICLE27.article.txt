# Stanford Center Develops Top Writers
## 
### DAVE BROWNWOOD 
Campus legend has it that
John Steinbeck ended his Stan
ford career after only two years
in an effort to preserve his indi
vidualistic prose style.
In the years since then, the Stan
ford Creative Writing Center has
developed many prospective Stein
becks to replace the one an ear
lier Stanford lost. "I doubt," asserts
Wallace Stegner, professor in the
Center, '"if any other college can
match the students here ... an
extraordinary number of good
young writers."
"Because of our fellowships and
scholarships, and because we pro
vide an environment in which peo
ple interested in the same things
can mix," explained Dr. Stegner,
"Stanford each year has the pick of
the country's best young writers."
He added that the center is one of
the few existing in the nation's col
leges.

The Creative Writing Center is
actually a subdivision of the Eng
lish Department, conducting the
department's creative writing
courses from freshman to gradu
ate level. Both A.B. and M.A. de
grees are offered in creative writ
ing, with emphasis on poetry,
drama, fiction, and criticism.
Qualifying freshmen may launch
their writing careers with English
2d, "Introduction to Narration." As
piring writers are chosen by their
instructors for advanced courses on
the basis of their writing ability. In
the higher divisions the work is on
a professional level. Many of the
students are published in nation
wide magazines.
"The Center is not. however/'
stressed Dr. Stegner, "a publica
tion mill." He explained that stu
dents are taught how to write,
not how to be published. 'The
creative writing student." he con
cluded, "will get into print by his
own (literary) virtues."
The center was formed in 1846

[ when Dr. E. H. Jones endowed the
! University with a $75,000 creative j
writing fellowship. Fellowships of
| $2,000 each are awarded each year to j
j five of the nation's promising young !
j writers chosen by the Fellowship
| Committee?
Although there is no ruling
; again st undergraduates, these
awards are usually given to grad
uate students. Four scholarships
of $5,000 each and several prizes
are also awarded each year.
• In the six years since the center i
, was founded, about 1,000 short
| stories and four novels by graduates ,
| have been published. Among the
i novels is Robert Williams' "The Hard
; Way." "The Best Short Stories of
' 1952" included a selection by Sue
Kuehn, a recent graduate of the
! center.
Numerous honors have also been
j received by Stanford writers, includ
| ing two Saxton Fellowships (Har
; pers), three Bender Awards,
by a San Francisco philanthropist,
and a Houghton Mifflin Fellowship. '

Campus legend has it that
John Steinbeck ended his Stan
ford career after only two years
in an effort to preserve his indi
vidualistic prose style.
In the years since then, the Stan
ford Creative Writing Center has
developed many prospective Stein
becks to replace the one an ear
lier Stanford lost. "I doubt," asserts
Wallace Stegner, professor in the
Center, '"if any other college can
match the students here ... an
extraordinary number of good
young writers."
"Because of our fellowships and
scholarships, and because we pro
vide an environment in which peo
ple interested in the same things
can mix," explained Dr. Stegner,
"Stanford each year has the pick of
the country's best young writers."
He added that the center is one of
the few existing in the nation's col
leges.

The Creative Writing Center is
actually a subdivision of the Eng
lish Department, conducting the
department's creative writing
courses from freshman to gradu
ate level. Both A.B. and M.A. de
grees are offered in creative writ
ing, with emphasis on poetry,
drama, fiction, and criticism.
Qualifying freshmen may launch
their writing careers with English
2d, "Introduction to Narration." As
piring writers are chosen by their
instructors for advanced courses on
the basis of their writing ability. In
the higher divisions the work is on
a professional level. Many of the
students are published in nation
wide magazines.
"The Center is not. however/'
stressed Dr. Stegner, "a publica
tion mill." He explained that stu
dents are taught how to write,
not how to be published. 'The
creative writing student." he con
cluded, "will get into print by his
own (literary) virtues."
The center was formed in 1846

[ when Dr. E. H. Jones endowed the
! University with a $75,000 creative j
writing fellowship. Fellowships of
| $2,000 each are awarded each year to j
j five of the nation's promising young !
j writers chosen by the Fellowship
| Committee?
Although there is no ruling
; again st undergraduates, these
awards are usually given to grad
uate students. Four scholarships
of $5,000 each and several prizes
are also awarded each year.
