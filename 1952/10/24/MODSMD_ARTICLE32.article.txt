# Frosh Meet Santa Clara
## 
### 
Many pro-Stanford observers last
week saw some consolation for the
varsity's defeat in the Papooses'
42-U trouncing of the Bru-babes.
However, same experts may
change their opinions when the
i'rosh meet their test in the Santa
Clara frosh this Saturday at 11 a.m.
in the Stanford Bowl.
In their onlv two outings this
year, the Broncos defeated the Col
lege of the Pacific, 19-0, and io-t to
the Treasure Island Sailors, 14-7.
The TI tefeat raises the Colli to
the heights of prominence among
Pacific Coast frosh teams. With an
influx of former Allege greats and
near-greati on the roster, the Sail
ors are a true measuring stick of
Santa Clara's ability.
To illustrate this point, the Cal
Ramblers and Sailors battled to a
scoreless tie. And die Ramblers de
feated Alameda Naval Air Station,
20-U, which is no mean feat when
you consider NAS is loaded with
an abundance of college talent.
Considering the l'rosh's explosive
showing last week and Santa Clara's
close defeat at the hands of TI, this
Saturday's fro-h game may be the
top frosh game of the year.
Last week the ( frosh powerhoused
to six touchdowns in the first half,
with fullback Bill Truher booming
for two scores and John Stewart
snagging two I'D passes from quar
terback Bob Gustafson. This scor
ing trio is expected to carry the
offensive load again this Saturday
in the varsity preliminary.
Statistically Stamord rolled up
yards on the ground and tÂ»l
passing. The Brubabes totaled G5
yards running and 92 passing.
