. . . The rcLounding Washington Huskies make their lirst 11)52 trek
into California Saturday to meet n lighting mad Stanford Indian who
also hopes to follow the comeback trail.
The defending champion Indians dropped their first game of the season
to mighty UCLA last weekend, 24-14, and are in no mood to be trilled with.
However, the Indians would have to be at their peak to outdo Washington
in bouncing back. Smarting from two sound spankings in a row, Howie
Odell's squad ripped through a luckless Oregon team 19-0 to satisfy a
Homecoming crowd Saturday.
'lhe Washington running attack, headed by Jack Kyllingstad, Frank
Lariza and Jack Nugent, never looked better as they shredded the
Oregon defense &t will. Heady signal-calling by quarterback Don Ileiu
ricli kept the Ducks off balance.
Heinrich, although rushed hard, threw three touchdown passes to set
a new Coast conference career record of 27, but his trusty right arm was
little more than an auxiliary to the Husky running game as he chose to
chew out the yardage there.
Oregon's heralded passing attack was kept well-smothered by the alert
Washington defenders during the sunny afternoon. The Huskies picked
off nine Duck aerials, a new Pacific Coast record, to break the continuity
of Coach Len Casanova's attack.
As satisfying as the victory was, Odcll and his staff got little salve
from it, because the medical department painted a gloomy picture for
this week's game. Captain Dick Spraguc may be out of action for the
season after aggravating an old back injury against Illinois two weeks
ago. Bill Earley, who surprised one and all by entering the Oregon
game for just one play to act as a decoy and going for a touchdown
on a pass reception, may not be ready (or the Indians. Phil Gillis, one of
the Coast's finest all-around ends, pulled up with a dislocated knee
Saturday and might miss the Stanford fray.
Should all three miss the opening kickoff, Odell undoubtedly would put
Sam Mitchell in at safety again, start Frank Lariza at right half offensively,
and turn to letterman Pete Elich at defensive end.
Crist Is Hack
The Indians took their lumps last weekend from the Bruins, but still
have a much-feared attack spearheaded by Olympics star Bob Mathias,
fullback Skip Crist and quarterback Bob Garrett, seemingly destined to
make Indian fans forget all about Gary Kerkorian, their passing star of
recent seasons.
First division hopes of both teams will depend largely upon Saturday's
outcome. The victor will go into the seventh week of the season with only
one PCC defeat and will be a clear-cut favorite to end up fourth or higher
in the conference race.
The 37-man Wahington squad will fly by chartered plane to San Fran
cisco, leaving the Seattle-Tacoma Airport at 9 a.m. Friday. The Husky
will work out shortly in the Stanford Stadium Friday afternoon and then
will retire to the Sainte Claire Hotel in nearby San Jose. The return trip
will be made Saturday night, with the team due to arrive in Seattle
around 10:30.
