# Indian Prince Adds Gridiron Glamour
## 
### WIN GRIFFITH 
Timm Williams is his real
name. He lives in San Francisco
and from Monday to Friday each
week he works at the Mission
Terminals Co. on the Embarca
dero.
Prince Lightfoot is his "true"
name, and it is by that title that
several thousand Stanford looters
know him. By the grace of his
generosity, the efforts of Rally Com,
and the approval of the students, he
has become the Indian's "mascot."
Each Saturday afternoon during
the present football season, he is
: ecn as a small, colorfully costumed
figure dancing into Stanford Stadium
with the primitive, rhythmic steps
of his tribe. His symbolic dances
and pre-gamc "benedictions" are
designed to bring speed, strength,
endurance, and, in the end, victory
to the Stanford eleven.
But Prince Lightfoot is no mere
"stunt" presented as an added at
traction for Stanford's games and
rallies. He is a full-blooded Yurok
Indian, horn and raised with many
of the customs of his tribe. He is
still active in many of the Yurok
activities, and each year he attends
its various ceremonials "to learn
to sing and dance better."
His tribe, the Yuroks, is com
posed of about 1,000 people living in
the Klamath area of Northern Cali
fornia. Prince Lightfoot still main
tains a keen interest in tribal ac
tivities, in spite of his "integration"
into metropolitan life. Like most In
dians, he believes that the govern
ment should follow through in its
responsibility to the tribe.
In 1855, he explained in an in
terview la't week, a contract was
signed between the party chiefs
and the federal government. The
contract, in effect, moved Light
foot's ancestors off their land and

onto reservations in exchange for i
"payment" for the property.
Lightfoot's people have never re
ceived any of the payment or the
interest which has brought the debt
to over $225 million. The Yurok
Tribal Organization has been fight
ing the case for 30 years, and Prince
Lightfoot expresses some pessimism
about its result.
Lightfoot's interest in Stanford,
he says, is the result of an in- i
tense admiration for the spirit of !
sportsmanship and friendship of

its students. Previous to last year's
Big Game, he was asked by
friends at Stanford to offer his
services as a mascot. He ap
proached Wayne Alley, ASSU
president, and was enlisted to
perform at the Big Game rally.
Prince Lightfoot intends to con
tinue his "mascot duties" as long as
the students want him. He consid
ers his only payment "lin. enjoy
ment I get from taking part in a
Stanford game."

Each Saturday afternoon during
the present football season, he is
: ecn as a small, colorfully costumed
figure dancing into Stanford Stadium
with the primitive, rhythmic steps
of his tribe. His symbolic dances
and pre-gamc "benedictions" are
designed to bring speed, strength,
endurance, and, in the end, victory
to the Stanford eleven.
But Prince Lightfoot is no mere
"stunt" presented as an added at
traction for Stanford's games and
rallies. He is a full-blooded Yurok
Indian, horn and raised with many
of the customs of his tribe. He is
still active in many of the Yurok
activities, and each year he attends
its various ceremonials "to learn
to sing and dance better."
His tribe, the Yuroks, is com
posed of about 1,000 people living in
the Klamath area of Northern Cali
fornia. Prince Lightfoot still main
tains a keen interest in tribal ac
tivities, in spite of his "integration"
into metropolitan life. Like most In
dians, he believes that the govern
ment should follow through in its
responsibility to the tribe.
In 1855, he explained in an in
terview la't week, a contract was
signed between the party chiefs
and the federal government. The
contract, in effect, moved Light
foot's ancestors off their land and

onto reservations in exchange for i
"payment" for the property.
Lightfoot's people have never re
ceived any of the payment or the
interest which has brought the debt
to over $225 million. The Yurok
Tribal Organization has been fight
ing the case for 30 years, and Prince
Lightfoot expresses some pessimism
about its result.
Lightfoot's interest in Stanford,
he says, is the result of an in- i
tense admiration for the spirit of !
sportsmanship and friendship of

its students. Previous to last year's
Big Game, he was asked by
friends at Stanford to offer his
services as a mascot. He ap
proached Wayne Alley, ASSU
president, and was enlisted to
perform at the Big Game rally.
Prince Lightfoot intends to con
tinue his "mascot duties" as long as
the students want him. He consid
ers his only payment "lin. enjoy
ment I get from taking part in a
Stanford game."
