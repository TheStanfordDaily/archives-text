Mrs. Jordan was valuable to her
husband as a literary aide, besides
bringing professors and students to
gether informally at her "Thurs
day evening at-homes."
Last year when Stanford honored
the 100 th anniversary of Dr. Jor
dan's birth, Mrs. Jordan said that
his high hopes for the school had
been "abundantly realized through
the great contributions the men and
women of Stanford have made to
world stability and to human prog
ress."
Since Dr. Jordan's death, she lived
on campus at 330 Sierra in the house
built for the Jordans in the early
twenties by the University.
