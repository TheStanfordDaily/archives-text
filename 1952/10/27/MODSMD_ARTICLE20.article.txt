The stall of "Chaparral," campus
j humor magazine, wasn't, laughing too
j hard yesterday.
And neither was its editor, Dunny
I Clark.
Ever since the staff decided to "go
out on a limb" to endorse a candi
date in the Nov. 4 Presidential elec
j tion for its first issue of the autumn
quarter, it's caused nothing but hot
political dissension.
And ClaHc nervously has one eye
I on his stall and the other on a rap
idly approaching deadline.
However, he has assured regular
"Chappie" readers that the maga
zine will come out on time and will
include usual "Chappie" features.
The magazine hits the stands at
8 a.m. Wednesday at the four cor
ners of the Quad, the Post Office,
and the Cellar. Price is ."0 cents.
