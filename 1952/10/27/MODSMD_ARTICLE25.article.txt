# Poll indicates Ike Popularity

Stanford students arc more than two to one for Eisenhower.
In a scientific random sampling poll taken by The Daily, per
cent of the students preferred Ike over Stevenson in next week's
election.
The eligible voters, however, differ from the campus as a whole.

Only 55 percent of the voting stu
dents like Ike; 41 percent favor
Stevenson. Four percent are eligible
but unable to vote.
Polled as to who they thought
would actually be elected, student
opinion changed, closely approxi
mating the preferences of the voting
students. Fifty percent of the en
tire sample, representing the student
lx)dy, thought Ike would win; 311
percent, Stevenson.
Of the 2KK students in the
sample, !!)(». or 6K percent, an
swered the question "Whom do
you want to win the presidential
election?" in favor of Eisenhower.
Stevenson polled 28 percent on
that question; and the remaining
four percent indicated that they
were undecided.
When asked "Whom do you thir
will win the presidential electior
the students revealed their sigm
cant trend in political thinking. C
the I?H> who witnt Eisenhower,
143, 50 percent of the entire sample,
think he will win a week from to
morrow. Thirty-nine percent of stu
dents polled predicted Stevenson
would win, an increase of 11 percent
over his preference rating. The re
maining 11 percent was undecided,
many students feeling the presi
dential race "too close" for predic
tions.
Further indications of currcnt
student political thinking show up
in the fact that while I!) percent
said they were for Eisenhower but
thought Stevenson would win, only
six percent were for Stevenson
and thought Eisenhower would
triumph.
Of the students polled, one wanted
Krajewski, the Poor Man's candi
date, and another was for Norman
Thomas. Both thought that Steven
son would win the election.
Thirty-one percent, 80 student,
in the sample, stated that thr>
were eligible to vote, and som~
percent of those eligible will
cast ballots Nov. 1.
The discrepancy between the num
ber of students who can vote and
the number who actually will vote
is partially explained by some stu
dents from states without absentee
ballot provisions.
The students who arr eligible
to vote were split in this way: 55
percent will vote for Eisenhower,
and 11 percent for Stevenson.
These statistics indicate that the
students eligible to vote, pre
dominantly seniors and graduate
students, are pretty evenly divided
between the two principl* candi
dates.
Of interest, it was nqted thai En
ema, Hoble, and Bow residents,
typifying undergraduates, were
overwhelmingly for Eisenhower.
The Village residents veered in the
opposite direction, with a high per
centage of the students favoring
Stevenson.
The Daily political poll was con
ducted in as scientifically objective
manner as was possible. Every
fifteenth card was taken from the
public directory of Stanford stu
dents enrolled this quarter, and
Daily staffers queried as many of
these students as was possible,
The validity of the poll as rep
resentative of the Stanford student
body as a whole may be indicated
by the fact that, as results were
tabulated, the incidence of opinion
remained constant on the questions
asked.

date, and another was for Norman
Thomas. Both thought that Steven
son would win the election.
Thirty-one percent, 80 student,
in the sample, stated that thr>
were eligible to vote, and som~
percent of those eligible will
cast ballots Nov. 1.
The discrepancy between the num
ber of students who can vote and
the number who actually will vote
is partially explained by some stu
dents from states without absentee
ballot provisions.
The students who arr eligible
to vote were split in this way: 55
percent will vote for Eisenhower,
and 11 percent for Stevenson.
These statistics indicate that the
students eligible to vote, pre
dominantly seniors and graduate
students, are pretty evenly divided
between the two principl* candi
dates.
Of interest, it was nqted thai En
ema, Hoble, and Bow residents,
typifying undergraduates, were
overwhelmingly for Eisenhower.
The Village residents veered in the
opposite direction, with a high per
centage of the students favoring
Stevenson.
The Daily political poll was con
ducted in as scientifically objective
manner as was possible. Every
fifteenth card was taken from the
public directory of Stanford stu
dents enrolled this quarter, and
Daily staffers queried as many of
these students as was possible,
The validity of the poll as rep
resentative of the Stanford student
body as a whole may be indicated
by the fact that, as results were
tabulated, the incidence of opinion
remained constant on the questions
asked.
Stanford students arc more than two to one for Eisenhower.
In a scientific random sampling poll taken by The Daily, per
cent of the students preferred Ike over Stevenson in next week's
election.
The eligible voters, however, differ from the campus as a whole.

Only 55 percent of the voting stu
dents like Ike; 41 percent favor
Stevenson. Four percent are eligible
but unable to vote.
Polled as to who they thought
would actually be elected, student
opinion changed, closely approxi
mating the preferences of the voting
students. Fifty percent of the en

lx)dy, thought Ike would win; 311
percent, Stevenson.

would win, an increase of 11 percent
over his preference rating. The re
maining 11 percent was undecided,
many students feeling the presi
dential race "too close" for predic

Further indications of currcnt
student political thinking show up
in the fact that while I!) percent
