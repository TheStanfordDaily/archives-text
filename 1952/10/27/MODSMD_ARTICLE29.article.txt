# Polities—in Poetry Yet
## 
### 
A petition was recently signed
By Farm profs with Stevenson lined.
Now this was the action
Of a minority fraction
Such as one can anywhere find.
'Iliis represents little, you see,
If only a fourth can agree;
For Adlai needs more
Than one out of four
If he wants to get into D.C.
Now the Daily, of confused Hoover fame
Played the story up like the Big Game.
Support, some profs do;
There could have been two
And the headline remain just the rame.
And what is the document like?
At what does its argument strike?
At how Ike has been "wrong"
The whole campaign long,
Ergo, Stevenson's less bad than Ike.

The cigarette ad is the source,
When a few docs the product endorse;
They don't say it's charmful,
It's merely less harmful;
The petition follows this course.
This ridiculous logic's a riot
Of which our country's ads are a diet.
To the ad men we'll tell,
"If you've something to sell,
Come to Stanford and someone will buy it
"Stanford's fallen for Ad?logic true,
In an Adlai-ad and addled too,
But it must be put forth
By more than one-fourth
To win at Electoral U.
So the Daily's a little oft key—
A non-partisan paper they'd be—
But oh, what hodge-podge!
That statement's a Dodge!
They're non-partisan? So'.s 11.5 T.!
