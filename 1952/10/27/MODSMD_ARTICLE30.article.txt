# Another View on Civil Rights
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Your managing editor, Walter Menninger, in de
ploring the Stanford faculty petition endorsing Stev
enson (Oct. 24), expresses his disappointment that
the 223 signers of the petition have not met his idea
of their intellectual standards. His expressed cavil
against the signers in this particular piece is against
the clause in the petition that Eisenhower is "wrong
on civil rights." To quote Mr. Menninger, "Unless
our logic is extremely inadequate, we do not see a
difference of opinion between the two candidates on
this question ..." I cannot question Mr. Menninger's
logic, as his argument is not in the realm of logic,
but rather in that of mere empirical documentation.
I do. however, accuse Mr. Menninger of being grossly
inadequate in his store of facts.
Eisenhower may indeed be for making "equality
of opportunity a living fact for every American, re
gardless of race, color or creed," But Eisenhower
also feels that the whole problem of civil rights can
and should be handled entirely by the States.
Surely Mr. Menninger knows that, in certain parts
of the country, such a position is tantamount to no
action at all in the field of civil rights. Stevenson,
on the other hand, has gone on record as saying
that if and when the States fail to act on civil rights,
and the situation demands that they should, then
the Federal Government should and must step in,
to see to it that every citizen's constitutional rights
are upheld. As the situation now demands that the
States do act, and as many States have given no
indication of so acting, Stevenson therefore is in
favor of a federal FEPC.
This seems to me to be a clear-cut difference of
opinion on the question of civil rights. I have no
doubt that this was what was alluded to when the
petition stated that Eisenhower was "wrong on civil
lights." Mr. Menninger apparently was unaware of
this difference of opinion. If not unaware of it, he
ignored it. In either case, he fails to satisfy my
'"tindards of a fair-minded editorial writer.

others may be interested in a further analysis of
tin- civil rights problem to appear in an editorial
