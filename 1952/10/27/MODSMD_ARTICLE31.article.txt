# A 						Clarification

To the Editor:
May I call your attention to an error in your story
of October 24 on the Stevenson endorsement? Though
no extensive canvas was made, non-teaching as well
as teaching .staff were given an opportunity to sign
the statement. The breakdown of the list according
to position in the university—made from the best
information available—is as follows:
Full professors, 42; associate professors, 29; as
sistant professors, 24; lecturers and instructors, 37;
teaching fellows and assistants, 31; research personnel
(in laboratories, institutes and projects), 29: library
personnel, 21; administrative and secretarial per
sonnel. 13.
In view of widely current misunderstanding, I
would be grateful if you would give this breakdown
some prominence in your Monday issue.
