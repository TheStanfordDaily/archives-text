# Against Faculty Actions
## 
### 
To the Editor:
At the risk of offending a number of very fine men
we have become acquainted with on the University
faculty and staff, we desire to stand against a pair
of political actions taken by members of the faculty
this week.
We refer to the petition endorsing Adlai Stevenson,
as well as the appeals for funds to support the cam
paign of the Democratic candidate.
As individuals or members of any external po
litical group they may wish to join, faculty mem
bers should not be deterred from political action.
It would he a definite and harmful abridgment of
academic freedom to hinder or prevent teachers
from supporting any form of political action they
desire to.
However, we do believe that to attach the name
of Stanford University to such action is both im
proper and contrary to University policy. To say
"ACADEMIC APPEAL (STANFORD)" ' very ap
parently impljp* â™¦he University supports the appeal.
It is not just foi any group to trade on the name
of Stanford University for any purpose. Hut in this

case we believe the question is particularly clear cut.
For many years such organizations as on-campus
political clubs have not been allowed at Stanford.
Consequently, it is not permitted for any group
of Students to. let us say, sign and publish a petition,
ad or solicit funds in the name of Stanford.
However, we are told that for many elections it
has been customary for professors to support political
candidates as they desire.
Is there no parallel between faculty and student
political action? When it comes down to actual fact
there is a greater number of Stanford students
eligible and interested in the current election than
there # are Stanford faculty and teaching staff mem
bers.
Should student political action he shunted off
campus, while faculty members engage in the same
as part of campus life? We believe that the Uni
versity is an arena of learning. And the emotional,
slanted, closed-minded support customary of po
litical candidates clouds the mind's understanding
and evaluation of a variety of conflicting view
points.
Therefore, we feel that the faculty members cur
rently involved should be asked to continue their
support as individuals or members of organizations
apart trom Stanford University.
