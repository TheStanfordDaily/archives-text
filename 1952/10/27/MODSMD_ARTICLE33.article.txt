### 
To the Editor:
We read with interest the letter of Sarah Hornig
(The Daily, Oct. 23) regarding d iscrimination on
Stanford's campus.
We should like to inform Miss Hornig and others
that there are not only Negro students on campus, but
also a chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement oi Colored People, whose members in
clude both white and Negro.
Some ol our activities have consisted of Negro
History Week programs, forums, exhibits and guest
speakers. Our future plans will be similar to those
of the past. '
We should like to extend an invitation to Miss
Hornig and other interested students to participate
in our program. Our next meeting will be held in the
lower lounge of the Women's Club House Wednes
day at 7:30.
