# Statisticians' Oversight
## 
### 
To the Editor:
The statisticians, it seems to me, have overlooked
a most important fact concerning the outcome of the
November elections. The fact is that, in the past
decades, the Democrats (probably because they tend
to lower socio-economic brackets) have been bear
ing more children than the Republicans. As a matter
ot fact, the Republican family has averaged only 2.3
children, whereas one may find that the average
Democratic family has 2.7 children. This is quite
a finding. Take the 55,000,000 people who are ex
pected to vote this year (You take the Republicans;
1 11 take the Democrats.): even granted that a gen
eration ago the vote was equally divided; certainly,
now, it is obvious that the Democrats have the edge
and that the edge with the passage of time is be
coming a landslide. Republicans! here is danger.
Subversion. The Democratic ranks have been swell
ing ail-stealthily from within!
Lest one get a wrong notion of what I am about
here, let nie make my stand clear. It* is not a ques
tion of how much heat or light is generated by
either of the candidates or their respective cohorts
—for, after all, heat acts only to fuse the parties
in even greater cohesion; and light, well I submit
that we have not seen on either side light so in
tense but that one might not shield his eyes with
his hands and try to squint beyond after the ulterior
motivation that must be there. No, J am writing
this to debunk the time-honored (and only by
time; certainly not be reason) political nostrums,
that our efforts might be more fruitfully directed.
Now, I know that tomorrow some Republican is
likely to answer: 'Sure, the average Democratic
family has more children; but, ha! mora Republicans
get married.'
'But, ha!' next day I'd counter, 'and more times!'
