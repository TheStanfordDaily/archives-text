# Where engineering and pioneering go together!

COMPLETION last Fall of the Bell Tele
phone System's coast-to-coast radio
relay route climaxed a production feat
that involved doing many things never
done before.
The engineers at Western Electric —
manufacturing unit of the Bell System -
were treading on uncharted ground
when they tackled the challenging job of
making the highly complex equipment.
This radio relay equipment — which
transmits telephone and television sig
nals at a carrier frequency of four thou
sand megacycles per second — called for
many components never made before and
for which no machinery, no tools, no as
sembly processes were known. Some
components required almost unbeliev
ably tiny parts-and fantastically small
tolerances,

Manufacturing facilities and tech
niques had to be developed to assemble
and wire the complicated equipment
which receives signals having less than
1/10 millionth of the power of an ordi
nary flashlight bulb-at frequencies ten
times as high as those used in television
sets —amplifies these signals 10 million
fold and transmits them to the next
tower some 30 miles away.
Finally, Western's engineers were re
sponsible for installing the equipment in
107 towers across the nation.
In all phases of this job, engineers of
varied skills worked closely together as
a team which just wouldn't be stopped
merely because "it hadn't been done be
fore." That's typical of work at Western
Klectric-where engineering and pio
neering go together. .

COMPLETION last Fall of the Bell Tele
phone System's coast-to-coast radio
relay route climaxed a production feat
that involved doing many things never
done before.
The engineers at Western Electric —
manufacturing unit of the Bell System -
were treading on uncharted ground
when they tackled the challenging job of
making the highly complex equipment.
This radio relay equipment — which
transmits telephone and television sig
nals at a carrier frequency of four thou
sand megacycles per second — called for
many components never made before and
for which no machinery, no tools, no as
sembly processes were known. Some
components required almost unbeliev
ably tiny parts-and fantastically small
tolerances,

Manufacturing facilities and tech
niques had to be developed to assemble
and wire the complicated equipment
which receives signals having less than
1/10 millionth of the power of an ordi
nary flashlight bulb-at frequencies ten
times as high as those used in television
sets —amplifies these signals 10 million
fold and transmits them to the next
tower some 30 miles away.
Finally, Western's engineers were re
sponsible for installing the equipment in
107 towers across the nation.
In all phases of this job, engineers of
varied skills worked closely together as
a team which just wouldn't be stopped
merely because "it hadn't been done be
fore." That's typical of work at Western
Klectric-where engineering and pio
neering go together. .
