Leiser Gives Us the Word
One Mr. Bill Leiser, Sports Editor of the San Franeisco Chronicle, has
"isured us, through the strangest system on record, that Stanford will win
the Big Game. We just have to sit back and await the celebration.
But as of all good things there is a catch. We ready have to sit back.
In fact we have to lose to San Jose State, USC, and Oregon in order to
beat the Bears. The mystery behind these doings is found in the actions
of the Daily sports staff, whose story we now reveal.
In one of its lighter moments a few weeks back, the stalT composed a
V'tter to Ml*. Leiser. It seems that for the opening three weeks of the
,<rid season William did not pick the Indians to whip their foes, and Stan
ford won her first three games.
Before the OSC game the collective staff of Don Webster, Mike Hudson,
Phil Berman, El Seeds, Dick Maltzman, newcomers Don Stephen's, Wes
Marx, Buss Wilks. Bill Wright, Pete Ferry, and Lou Pujalet, and egged on
by yours truly, scribbled a plea to Mr. Leiser asking him to keep picking
tiie Curds to lose and as long as he did that we were confident Stanford
would keep winning.
Bill, though a Stanford alum, seemed to think his reputation as a
prognosticator meant more than Stanford winning, and he switched horses
in the middle of the stream, and hopped on the Stanford bandwagon. We
sailed through OSC despite his picking us to win. But Mr. Leiser con
tinued pressing and went with the Indians to whip UCLA. The red wagon
could not carry late comer Leiser any longer and fell to pieces.
The Sports Staff could not constrain itself. Another missile went winging
oward the Chronicle begging Bill to refrain from picking Stanford and
assuring him again that the Big Red could win without his kind words
which were so often the kiss of death.
But still he would not go all the way with us. Rather he made his
offer through the following letter which has Stanford winning the Big
Game, but alas, losing lour. Here's the letter we received Friday:
Mr. Leiser*s Letter
"Gentlemen of the Stanford Daily Sports Staff: Your pleading touches
me deeply, and I ani inclined to help you. though, your logic impresses
me as student logic usually impresses graduates of 30 plus years ago.
In 1940 I picked Stanford to win every game. Nobody else got around
to picking Stanford until the fourth and fifth games. The team survived
my picks and those of others also. The Vow Boys did all right in spite
of my picks. So did the 1928 gang against Army, and the Ernie Nevers
crews of 1924 and 1925. What's the matter down there? Are your foot
ballers no longer he-men who can take it?
To help. I'll do this: I'll pick Stanford to win each Saturday until
the Big Game week. That week I'll pick California. Therefore you
will lose every game up to then, which won't matter in the least, and !
against the Bears yo*.i will score one of the most gloriÂ«us upsets of the
year. That will be the best possible result for Stanford this year, won't
it? Remember to thank me. (I hope you do it). Best, Bill Leiser."
He picked Stanford Saturday and we lost. He shall pick Stanford on
the next three Saturdays and if things run true to Leiser form, Stanford
will be defeated those three Saturdays.
And then bang, the whammy goes on California, but good. Mr Leiser
will pick the Cards to lose, and because everytinie he does, they refuse
to lose, Stanford will win her first Big Game since 1946.
That's how Mr. Leiser has it figured for Stanford to win the Big Game J
.ind the Sports Staff wishes to endorse his scheme. But Mr. Leiser if
perchance you feel benevolent the week of Nov 8 you might pick us to
lose to USC and then we will be one step closer to an upset.
Of course we can't be greedy. You have agreed only to win the Big
Game for us, and for that we are grateful. So Mr. Leiser, just remember
that Big Game loss prediction. With your help and whatever aid Chuck
Taylor and his lads feel should supplement your pick, we of the Sports
Staff now relax, worries over, and anxiously await a jubilant Nov. 22.
