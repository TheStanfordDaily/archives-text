# Odell High On Stanford
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
In the Washington dressing room,
Coach Howie Odell, one of the most
amiable coaches in the PCC, gave
the vanquished Indians a generous
nod. "Stanford has the hardest
running backs of any team we've
met this year 1 . And that includes I
Illinois. That Mathias, boy, how I'd j
love to have him on my team. If he
plays football next year, he's got
possibilities of being an all-time
great. What's more, he's a good re
ceiver. Also, I like this boy Gar
rett."
Then, Oclell provided a little salve
for the Stanford wounds when he
popped, "I'll bet anyone a buck that
Stanford beats either USC or Cal.''
The dark-haired Husky coach al
lowed that Washington's last touch
down, the SO-yarder from Heinrich
to end George Black, was the crown
that gave Washington the victory. |
"I'd have been scared if we didn't
make that one."
Incidentally, that play was origi
nally called as an end run. Hein- 1
rich called for an end run in the !
huddle, and then switched his sig
nals at the line of scrimmage when
he spotted a Stanford defensive
weakness.
Rumor has ,it that the Indians!
won't take San Jose State lightly
next week. Stanford is hungry.
