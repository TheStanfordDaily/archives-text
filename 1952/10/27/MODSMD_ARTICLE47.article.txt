# Big Game Prevue? Card Booters Stun Cal, 4 to 2
## 
### JIM MADISON 
j In one of the most brilliantly played soccer games at Stanford
, in several years, the Cards completely stunned California Satur
j day morning, 4 to 2.
Striking early and then fighting back desperate Bear thrusts, the
' Cards were never behind as they fought their way past Cal into

second spot in the Northern Cal
Soccer Conference.
Just nine minutes into the open
ing quarter right inside Sam Sua
rez alertly followed up a rush at the
Cal goal with the first scoring shot
of the day.
The hard-charging Stanford line—
spearheaded by Suarez, Earl Ander
son, Dick Konigsberger, and bril
liantly led by center forward Ron
Hall—made it 2 to 0 in the second
quarter when Anderson scored fol
lowing a cross from left wing Ko
nigsberger.
Cal came back with a 20-yard
kick by left inside Dennis Trayson,
but late in the second quarter An
derson, after taking a deep pass and
dribbling past the Cal fullback, re
versed to Hall, who plunked in a
third Stanford goal.
The final Stanford score came in
the third period on the most beau
tiful play of the day. Suarez drib
bled the ball into the left-hand cor
ner of the Bear defensive area and
crossed it just in front of Cal's goal.
Hall, precisely in position, headed it
cleanly into the net, drawing raves
from even the most exacting soccer
experts among the spectators.
In the final period the Bears be
gan a last-gasp drive, typical of
their style of play. Attempting to
take advantage of a tiling Card de
fense, they initiated practically a
10-man offensive rush.
It was good for a second goal by
Trayson, but Stanford stood its
ground amid several outstanding
saves by goalie Ben Swan. And
when Hall, who had been taken out
to protect a bruised back after his

final scoring shot, re-entered the
fray, the Cards narrowly missed
running up an even higher score on
the beaten Bears.
