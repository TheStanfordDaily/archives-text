# Versatile Huskies Beat Cards, 27-14
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
He camc, ho passed, he conquered. For the second time in three
years, Don Heinrich personally escorted Stanford out of the PCC
lace.
True, Heinrich had help from a surprisingly quick-opening
ground attack and that old Devil Fumble; but it was Heinrich's

diverse play - calling, good faking, j
and All-American arm that brought
about the 27-14 shellacking.
The Huskies scored more points
off Stanford's first - string defense j
than any other foe this year. Does j
this mean that Washington had the j
best offense that the Cards have |
faced? It certainly looked like it.
While Heinrich's passing kept the
defense spread and the line charg
ing at top speed, the Huskies ran
trap plays up the middle with

I I
Washington's two new finds, Jack
Nugent and Jack Kyllingstad, pick
ing up five yards ft a crack. In
jured Bill Earley came off the bench
and also added plenty !•> the versa
| tile Husky attack.
A few bouquets also ought to go
j to some of the unsung Husky line
men. Mammoth George Black, who
started the season on the defense,
j shagged seven passes and made two
scores. Tracy King, a converted
end, and 214 - pound Fred nudnik
were a rough pair of guards. De
spite two early - season drubbings,
the Huskies .should be rough in fu
i ture tilts.
Heinrich, by tlt* way, fattened his
i six-game totals to 88 completions on
I lt!7 tries for 1,172 yards per game.
| He leads the nation in all depart
ments.
The Card 5 were held to their low
est .-•core of the year. Does thit
mean that the Huskies had as good
a defense as the Cards have seer
all year? Definitely not. "We made
too many nice drives and too few
touchdowns," Coach Chuck Tayloi
mused. That about summed it up.
The Cards showed their early-sea
son form as they dropped Bobbj
Garrett's soft lobs and fumbled at
crucial moments.
Taylor praised the way that his
team came back in the second half.
"They were really fired up. This
was Washington's best game and
j that Ileinrich is masterful."
. Taylor said the team played a bet
ter game than last week. "Bobby
Garrett was passing wry well, and
he received nice ;*otection. I
thought that John Steinberg played
his game at end and that Sam
Morley, despite a bad back, was his
usual effective self."
The Card coach also singled out
| lienbacker Ted Tanner, back Skip
;iy Crivt, tackle John Ludeke, and
defensive halfback Joe St. Genie for
special praise.
The happiest note of the day was
sounded by trainer Connie Jarvis,
who reported that there were no
Card injuries in yesterday's battle.

He camc, ho passed, he conquered. For the second time in three
years, Don Heinrich personally escorted Stanford out of the PCC
lace.
True, Heinrich had help from a surprisingly quick-opening
ground attack and that old Devil Fumble; but it was Heinrich's

diverse play - calling, good faking, j
and All-American arm that brought
about the 27-14 shellacking.
The Huskies scored more points
off Stanford's first - string defense j
than any other foe this year. Does j
this mean that Washington had the j
best offense that the Cards have |
faced? It certainly looked like it.
While Heinrich's passing kept the
defense spread and the line charg
ing at top speed, the Huskies ran
trap plays up the middle with

I I
Washington's two new finds, Jack
Nugent and Jack Kyllingstad, pick
ing up five yards ft a crack. In
jured Bill Earley came off the bench
and also added plenty !•> the versa
| tile Husky attack.
A few bouquets also ought to go
j to some of the unsung Husky line
men. Mammoth George Black, who
started the season on the defense,
j shagged seven passes and made two
scores. Tracy King, a converted
end, and 214 - pound Fred nudnik
were a rough pair of guards. De
spite two early - season drubbings,
the Huskies .should be rough in fu
i ture tilts.
Heinrich, by tlt* way, fattened his
i six-game totals to 88 completions on
I lt!7 tries for 1,172 yards per game.
| He leads the nation in all depart
ments.
The Card 5 were held to their low
est .-•core of the year. Does thit
mean that the Huskies had as good
a defense as the Cards have seer
all year? Definitely not. "We made
too many nice drives and too few
touchdowns," Coach Chuck Tayloi
mused. That about summed it up.
The Cards showed their early-sea
son form as they dropped Bobbj
Garrett's soft lobs and fumbled at
crucial moments.
Taylor praised the way that his
team came back in the second half.
"They were really fired up. This
was Washington's best game and
j that Ileinrich is masterful."
. Taylor said the team played a bet
ter game than last week. "Bobby
Garrett was passing wry well, and
he received nice ;*otection. I
thought that John Steinberg played
his game at end and that Sam
Morley, despite a bad back, was his
usual effective self."
The Card coach also singled out
| lienbacker Ted Tanner, back Skip
;iy Crivt, tackle John Ludeke, and
defensive halfback Joe St. Genie for
special praise.
The happiest note of the day was
sounded by trainer Connie Jarvis,
who reported that there were no
Card injuries in yesterday's battle.
