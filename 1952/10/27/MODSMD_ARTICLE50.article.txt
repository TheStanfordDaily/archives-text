# Santa Clara Frosh Rally in Late Burst
## 
### DON STEPHENS 
The Stanford frosh lost to their old nemesis again!
Once more, with a brilliant season ahead of them, the Papooses
succumbed to a fighting Santa Clara eleven who failed to be awed
by Stanford's 42-0 win over the Bru-babes, and overcame a two
touchdown lead to post a 20-17 win last Saturday.

In 1951), when Stanford entered â™¦
the game with an impressive 18- I
game frosh win streak compiled j
since 1947, an Inconsistent frosh i
team from Santa Clara knocked :
over the young lunjuns, 20-19.
With Jerry Gustafson hitting
eight out of nine passes for 81 yards ;
and two touchdowns, the Stanford
frosh eased to a 14-0 half-time ad- j

' vantage, only to wither in the sec
i ond hall under Joe Quinn's second
| half aerial display which netted
! the Broncos' two scores and the vie
! tory.
When Stanford fir<t got their
hands on the ball they drove G7
| yards in 13 plays to a TD on Gus
| tuLon's 12-yard heave to Jim Tru
her.
Alter holding the SC frosh to mi
nus yardage during an exchange of
punts, Stanford, sparked by Gus
tafson's four completed passes, in
cluding his 23-yard TD toi-.s to Den
nis Doren, drove 49 yards in seven
plays to pay dirt.
From here on in, defensively and
offensively, it was all Santa Clara.
As the half started, Stanford got
in a final and brief offensive spurt
which fell short on the SC 18-yard
line. Then Horsey Atkinson came in
and promptly booted a field goal.
Fie also completed both extra points
to run his streak to nine straight.
With the score now 17-0, tho
Broncos started to roll.
From their own 22-yard line they
drove 78 yards in eight plays to
score, the final yardage coming on
Quinn's 24-yard pass to Mase Mas
tellotto who ran the final 20 yards
unmolested.
On the following kick-off, Scott
J~>nes fumbled and Bronco Jack
Trilley recovered on the Stanford 12-
yard line. Gustafson got the touch
down in two plays, the final play
on Quinn's eight-yarder to end Wil
lis Towne.
During the early minutes of the
final quarter, Bronco Joe Heuer in
tercepted a Gustafson aerial on the
Stanford 30. Quinn promptly hit
Jim Decker with a 29-yard heave
I on the one-yard line. On the next
play Quinn sneaked over into pay
dirt.
Fullback Bill Tarr suffered the
only injury and should be ready for
the USC fro&h, Nov. 8.
