Many of you with fond remembrance of "The Circus Wagon" on
El Camino Real, one of Menlo Park's old landmarks, w.ll recall the
exquisitely colored etched glass windows and its fine hardwood in
teror. The "Wagon" was shipped to San Francisco in 1906; the
horse-drawn vehicle was located next to the old Examiner Building.
It was a rendezvous for many celebrites and newspapermen.
Finally, in 1926, it was shipped to Menlo Park. Our localites gath
ered there for an after-theatre snack. Often during War 11, with its
, stress, one could sip coffee and momentarily glance out at the pass
ing parade through rose-colored glasses.
To make the decision to dismantle the old landmark was difficult,
but our business necessitated opening a second used car lot for our
mounting sales.
However, I have preserved these exquisite glass panels mounted by
our local William Easton; they will be displayed at our sales room
during the showing of the new 1953 Chrysler.
Exquisite is the word for these beautifully colored glass panels
etched in Belgium —
Exquisite is the word for the new 1953 Chrysler

with perfect balance. Exquisite interior handsomely tailored with
rich fabrics for your enjoyment and pride.
These matchess classics of art and engineering will be shown start
ing Thursday, October 30, at 720 High Street, Palo Alto
W« welcome you
