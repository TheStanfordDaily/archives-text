# Soft Coal Workers Report Back to Jobs After Strike
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 (UP)—John L. Lewis ordered the week
old soft coal strike ended "at once" iroday and minors across the
nation immediately began reporting back to work.
The United Mine Workers chief telegraphed his instructions to
district union leaders after a surprise Sunday White House con-

ference at which President Tru
man urged him to call off the walk
out "in the common good."
Economic Stabilizer Roger L. Put
nam told a news conference, how
ever, that Lewis received "r.o as
surances" the miners would get the
full $1.90-a-day pay increase he
won from the industry.
The:) 50,000 soft coal diggers
quit work the day the Wage Sta
bilization Board cut the watfe
boost to $1.50 on grounds the ex
tra 40 cents would feed inflation.
Lewis told them to go back to
work while this decision was be
ing "reviewed."
Before Mr. Truman intervened in
the strike Sunday, Lewis and indus
try officials had joined in an appeal
to the wage board to reconsider its
slash of 40 cents from the miners'
increase.
Meanwhile, the Defense Solid
Fuels Administration (DSFA) said
coal mines which resume produc
tion may automatically start ship
ping coal. DSFA had issued an
order barring coal shipments from
mines where operations were
baited by the walkout. The idea
was to build up an emergency
coal stockpile.
Putnam indicated to reporters
that final action on the soft coal
contract may not be taken until
after the Presidential election next
Tuesday.
This would greatly diminish any
political significance of the wage
board's ruling. Lewis had already
spared the Democrats the necessity
of campaigning while a major strike
was in progress.
