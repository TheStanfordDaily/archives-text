j only main line position taken by the
| Chinese, fought two .small but shar|i
I battles with groups of Reds still on
the ridge. The last group was killed
or dispersed at 15 a.m. (1 p.m. PST
yesterday) ami Marines moved out
behind a terrific artillery bombard
ment to occupy the position, with
out resistance.
In mopping up on (lie hook, the
Marincs reoccupicd the outpost
hills called "Frisco" and "Ronson"
to win back all the ground lost in
Sunday night's Chinese human soa
assaidt. The last outpost hill was
recaptured at 8:10 a.m. today (3:10
PST yesterday).
The outpost "Warsaw" had been
! retaksn earlier.
Col. Thomas Moore, White
Plains, Ga., of the Marine First
Division Staff estimated the Ma
rines "hurt badly" at least two
full battalions—about 1,500 men—
in haulting the Chinese assault and
rewinning lost positions.
First estimates placed Red casual
ties at nearly (500 men killed or
wounded.
It was the most powerful Chinese
attack since their assault on the
central front Chorwon corridor, the
second major route to Seoul, three
weeks ago.
They struck behind a thunderous
17.000-round artillery and mortar
barrage that officers said was the
heaviest to hit a single regiment
in Leatherneck history.
"It was hell on earth," a liflc
j man said, "if a guy could live
through that, he knew God was
l>cside him."
Attacking in "human sea" waves
along a three-mile front northwest
of Korangpo-Ri, the Chinese over
ran three advance positions and
punched a hole in the Marines' main
line before counterattacks drove
I them back.
Main Red attack was aimed at the
j long, rolling ridgelinc northeast of
I the truce village of Panmunjom
j known as the hook. It is the back
! bone of the United Nations defense
line in that sector.

Sunday night's Chinese human soa
assaidt. The last outpost hill was
recaptured at 8:10 a.m. today (3:10
PST yesterday).
The outpost "Warsaw" had been
! retaksn earlier.
Col. Thomas Moore, White
Plains, Ga., of the Marine First
Division Staff estimated the Ma
rines "hurt badly" at least two
full battalions—about 1,500 men—
in haulting the Chinese assault and
rewinning lost positions.
First estimates placed Red casual
ties at nearly (500 men killed or
wounded.
It was the most powerful Chinese
attack since their assault on the
central front Chorwon corridor, the
second major route to Seoul, three
weeks ago.
They struck behind a thunderous
17.000-round artillery and mortar
barrage that officers said was the
heaviest to hit a single regiment
in Leatherneck history.
"It was hell on earth," a liflc
j man said, "if a guy could live
through that, he knew God was
l>cside him."
Attacking in "human sea" waves
along a three-mile front northwest
of Korangpo-Ri, the Chinese over
ran three advance positions and
punched a hole in the Marines' main
line before counterattacks drove
I them back.
Main Red attack was aimed at the
j long, rolling ridgelinc northeast of
I the truce village of Panmunjom
j known as the hook. It is the back
! bone of the United Nations defense
line in that sector.
