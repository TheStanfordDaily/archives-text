# Taft and Ike—Analysis of 'Surrender'
## 
### 
Taft. The word iteell is enough to make Dem
ocrats froth at the mouth. There can be no
greater evil for the country than Robert A. Taft.
Co they imply. And Eisenhower, the Demo
cratic campaigners wail, has "surrendered" to
Taft.
W'e can't find oureelves led so blindly to this
conclusion; and we feel it's high time a reason
„ able analysis of the Eisenhower-Taft relation
ship was made.
First, what has supposedly led us to be
lieve that Eisenhower has "surrendered" to
Taft? The two men met some weeks alter
the convention to discuss their mutual goal,
victory lor the Republican party. They came
out ot their conference satislied with the con
clusions they have reached. "Ergo," say'the
Democrats, "Eisenhower has surrendered!"
To pinpoint the issue, the question to be
answered is where do Ike and Taft disagree
and where do they agree.
On domestic issues, Taft is recognized as a
competent authority and his views are highly
regarded—we certainly do not believe anyone
can or should condemn Eisenhower for agree
ing with Taft on his relatively liberal domestic
policy.
The ballyhooed disagreement, therefore,
stems from the foreign policy. Eisenhower, we
know, favors continuation of support for Europe,
with certain limitations—some reasonable eco
nomic pruning which we agree is necessary.
He favors a more concrete attitude toward Asia
and the Korean war—an element sorely lacking
in the current administration.
Furthermore, Ike has indicated that he will
take steps to improve our relations in the
Near East (another weak link in current for
eign policy) and step-up the psychological
follow-up on American accomplishments
(such as the Voice of America which the. cur-

J
rent administration has managed so poorly).
Yet. what Ike favors means nothing at least
so the Democrats would have us believe. A Re
publican victory, by their interpretation, means
that foreign policy will be directed by memo
from the office of Senator Taft. This reasoning
simply doe>3 not follow.
In the American governmental system, the
administration of foreign policy is a function
of the executive branch —headed by the presi
dent. The president may utilize advice of legis
lators or citizens in all walks of life in determin
ing his policies- but the responsibility of ad
ministration falls on his shoulders and if Eisen
hower is elected, foreign policy must be of his
Taft has evidenced, in several cases, mis
taken judgment in foreign policy —and that is
one reason Eisenhower, and not he, is the Re
publican nominee. But we see absolutely no
reason why Eisenhower cannot profit from
some of Taft's knowledge.
We teel it is all important for the man who
is to be at the helm ol the county to be fully
informed of all viewpoints. And whether
Democrats appreciate it or not, Robert Taft
represents a considerable segment of the
people in his viewpoints. This seems all the
more reason, to us, lor Eisenhower to consult
with Taft.
But it does not follow that, since Eisenhower
has consulted with Taft, that he has "surren
dered" to Taft, anymore than in consulting with
Tom Dewey, he has surrendered to Dewey.
On the contrary, we recognize Eisenhower
as an intelligent man attempting to profit from
all viewpoints. And it goes without saying that
the opinions of Robert Taft will be far more
valid, in assisting the next president of the
United States, than the opinions of Harry Tru
man.—Wait Menninger
