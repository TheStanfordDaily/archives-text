# On Conservatives' Duty
## 
### 
.To tlie Editor:
I should like to make a few observations faintly
relevant to the letter of Mr. Name Withheld which
appeared in the Wednesday issue of the Daily.
It might nut be inappropriate to suggest to Mr.
Withheld what to me seems a dereliction of duty on
tlie part of conservatives who. by definition, are in
terested in adhering to existing institutions. By rang
ing themselves behind the banner of the Republican
vice-presidential candidate and the Senator from Wis
consin, to mention two examples, Republican con
servatives are permitting the traditional practice of
American justice to be discarded. Guilt by association,
an earlier resort, now by a further deviation has been
per fee tod into guilt by accusation. Presumably this
is a subtle adaptation of the childhood pastime of
pointing a play gun,and ordering the person at whom
it is directed to "drop dead"; but the lethal charge
of the McCarthy-Nixon "infernal machine" should not
be underestimated.
An example of the technique is the Senator from
California's nationwide self-exoneration appearance
wherein he posited the principle that because he,
(.'•rand Jury-like, was calling upon his political op
ponents to "come clean" (as he inferred he was
doing) on the matter of finances, any reticence on
their part would he clear evidence of guilt. The
"One Little, Two Little, Three Little Indian" tech
nique of McCarthy is still within ih<* range of living
memory and docs not require further reference.
However the connection between this method and
that of military law should not he too dillicult to
ascei tain. In both the accused is assumed to he
guilty until h has been proved innocent.
if the conservative is adhering to the Republican
party because he believes it to be the best instrument
for tho realization of his ideals and il the conservation
of our political, legal, individual, social, and economic
rights is considered essential, it seems to me he will
have to do a great d<*al of soul-searching before he
consciously can put a plus mark opposite the par ty
Candidateb this year.
1 shall not be too surprised' to hear that, like Senator
Morse of Oregon. Mr, Withheld lias concluded it would

be best to move from tiie town house to the country
until the plague has abated and the "carriers" have
fled the scene.
However if the Republican conservative instead of
"sitting on his hands in an easy chair" (or anywhere
else), applauds the direction in which the party's
officials ure leading, obviously there is a basic differ
ence between what he and I consider worth conserving.
Mr. Withheld and I are in agreement regarding the
threat to our basic rights and freedoms which un
limited extensions of federal power and centraliza
tion might bring. But we are not in agreement, by
inference at least, in the belief that the present
standard bearers of the Republican party would pro
vide the best insurance against further centraliza
tion. (I hope that I am wrongly imputing this ''guilt
by association" to Mr. Withheld).
To rue it is a very serious misreading ol the facts
to expect that the General who has spent over 40 years
of his life in one of the most thoroughly bureaucratic
and centralized organizations to be found anywhere,
would, if inaugurated, suddenly become a strong be
liever in the development of policy at the platoon and
squad level. As the General observed when questioned
about a political decision in his theater of command,
"Who ever asks advice from a second lieutenant?"
