# 'Copying of Fad'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
In the recent history of our University there oc
curred what was considered to be a childishly in
discreet action an unoriginal copying of a fad started
at, 1 believe, the University of Michigan. This was
the panty raid. Now, approximately six months later,
we find ourselves stringing along with another fad
started at Columbia University. But this time it is
the elders of the tribe who are the participants; and
it miiPt be granted that the experience brought by
mature years and minds enables them to do a bang-up
job with their exploit which our youth did not: a
page of the Palo Alto Times was not rented to dis
play the names of those who triumphantly carried
off some dainty unmentionable.
Unlike those of my worthy colleagues who have
sallied from the ivory tower to wave their names
before the public in an affair about which they may
know less than about the manipulation of protons,
the building of squares upon hypotenuses, or de
termining Keats' favorite midnight snack, I wish
after this perhaps too distant venture, to crawl back
into the tower and remain
