# Against 'Aroma'

To the Editor:
The publicity of 150 members of the faculty com
ing out for Stevenson doesn't mesh into Stanford
tradition, and seems to be an illegitimate birth of
an innovation.
We don't care what Columbia does, but Stanford
is old Stanford, and I cannot remember any time
when this sort of stuff came out in the papers and
over the radio.
Mind you, this is not from a big shot alumnus, but
I just don't like the aroma of it. Of course, I'm for
Eisenhower, but. here's the difference—l hope and
pray that the Republican members of the staff do
not have the bad grace to follow suit.
I only hope that you have received plenty of other
.otters and calls to the same effect that we will not
havi any more of this type of publicity.
