# Some Conclusions

### 
To the Editor:
My preference is for General Eisenhower; I agree
with him on ull ma'or issues. is undesirable,
for every job given to a member of a minority group
deprives a deserving natural-born American from
an income. Corporation taxes should be diminished
proportionally more than individual taxes: the sin -
vival of this country is dependent upon the survival
of the free-enterprise corporation. Nationalised
health insurance requires no more comment than to
note that the wo: < \onalized" is synonymous with
the word "socializcu.''
But upon reading the results of the Stanford popu
-1 rity poll, I have become somewhat disturbed. Sup
port for the General was strongest in the freshman
♦ dormitories and weakest among the graduate stu
* dents. This implies that a preference for Stevenson
is correlated with the maturation of the mind. My
..alternatives are to reject the General or to accept
my inferior mental status. Is it possible that your
manner of poll-taking was invalid?

Daily's poll was based on a scientific random
sampling of names taken from the public directory
in the Registrar's office. We are willing to stand
behind its accuracy; the reader may draw his own
conclusions from the facts the poll revealed.)
