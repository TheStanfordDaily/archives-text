### Faculty Administration 
INTELLECTUAL CUICIOSITY
(Editor's note: Today's column was written by
Dr. Donald W. Taylor, associate professor of psy
chology. Dr. Taylor has won his students' admira
tion for what they term "his sincere interest in
young people and their problems.")
College students are often asked. "Why did you
come to college?" Let's be still more specific and
ask, "Why did you choose the courses in which you
are enrolled this quarter?" There are many good and
valid reasons that could be given in answer to this
question, but there is one answer that, it seems to
me, isn't given often enough. That is, "For fun!"
What I have in mind is that an important reason
for taking a particular course can be simply the desire
to get acquainted with and to find out something
about a new and unknown field. Learning something
new ought to be fun in and of itself. Satisfying one's
curiosity is at least as important as other more prac
tical goals. |
Why isn't learning—in the context of a college
course—fun more often? Part of the time, I must
admit, the fault is the responsibility of those of us
who teach. Partly the fault is the result of the limi
tations of the system under which we work. But it
is also true that students often fail to realize the
intrinsic satisfaction of learning something new be
cause of their own atittudes toward learning—atti
tudes established long before they entered college.
Perhaps I can explain what I mean by an analogy.
The difference between the spectators and the par
ticipants at a football game is obvious. The distinc
tion between spectators and participants in a class
room is less apparent but equally important. With
classes of 50 to 300 students, participation of in
dividual students may at first glance appear impos
sible. But what I am talking about is not whether
the student asks questions orally or makes comments

in class, but about the attitude with which he ap
proaches the content of the lecture or textbook. Does
lie regard the content as something to be passively
accepted and dutifully memorized for the purpose ol
repeating it on the final examination—after which he
can safely forget all about it? Or does he take an
active interest in it as something to be understood,
to be examined critically—something whose mastery
is in itself a reward?
There are great differences in the amount of in
tellectual curiosity shown by different people. Some
students seem to be almost continuously curious;
they want to know more about every new thing or
idea with which they come in contact —just for the
satisfaction that knowing gives. They are in a very
real sense the participants in the educational process.
Other people appear almost totally incurious. To
them, knowledge is something to be acquired only
to satisfy some arbitrary requirement. Their role is
that of the spectator, not the participant.
I believe that this quality of intellectual curiosity
is at least to some extent a habit of thinking that can
be cultivated. 1 believe that by training it can be in
creased and that such training is an important part
of a college education. Teachers have an obligation
to stimulate and foster intellectual curiosity; they do
not always fulfill that obligation. But it is up to the
individual student himself to become an active par
ticipant in learning; it is something he must do for
himself because no one can do it for him.
A person who has learned to find intrinsic satis
factions in learning is one whose education will not
stop when he completes the requirements for his
degree(s). He will continue learning throughout his
life. He will be more likely to contribute effectively
to the society of which he is a part. He will have a
wider range of knowledge and interests than his less
curious friends. And he will have a lot of fun.

creased and that such training is an important part
of a college education. Teachers have an obligation
to stimulate and foster intellectual curiosity; they do
not always fulfill that obligation. But it is up to the
individual student himself to become an active par
ticipant in learning; it is something he must do for
himself because no one can do it for him.
A person who has learned to find intrinsic satis
factions in learning is one whose education will not
stop when he completes the requirements for his
degree(s). He will continue learning throughout his
life. He will be more likely to contribute effectively
to the society of which he is a part. He will have a
wider range of knowledge and interests than his less
curious friends. And he will have a lot of fun.
INTELLECTUAL CUICIOSITY
(Editor's note: Today's column was written by
Dr. Donald W. Taylor, associate professor of psy
chology. Dr. Taylor has won his students' admira
tion for what they term "his sincere interest in
young people and their problems.")
College students are often asked. "Why did you
come to college?" Let's be still more specific and
ask, "Why did you choose the courses in which you
are enrolled this quarter?" There are many good and
valid reasons that could be given in answer to this
question, but there is one answer that, it seems to
me, isn't given often enough. That is, "For fun!"
What I have in mind is that an important reason
for taking a particular course can be simply the desire
to get acquainted with and to find out something
about a new and unknown field. Learning something
new ought to be fun in and of itself. Satisfying one's
curiosity is at least as important as other more prac
tical goals. |
Why isn't learning—in the context of a college
course—fun more often? Part of the time, I must
admit, the fault is the responsibility of those of us
who teach. Partly the fault is the result of the limi
tations of the system under which we work. But it
is also true that students often fail to realize the
intrinsic satisfaction of learning something new be
cause of their own atittudes toward learning—atti
tudes established long before they entered college.
Perhaps I can explain what I mean by an analogy.
The difference between the spectators and the par
ticipants at a football game is obvious. The distinc
tion between spectators and participants in a class
room is less apparent but equally important. With
classes of 50 to 300 students, participation of in
dividual students may at first glance appear impos
sible. But what I am talking about is not whether
the student asks questions orally or makes comments

in class, but about the attitude with which he ap
proaches the content of the lecture or textbook. Does
lie regard the content as something to be passively
accepted and dutifully memorized for the purpose ol
repeating it on the final examination—after which he
can safely forget all about it? Or does he take an
active interest in it as something to be understood,
to be examined critically—something whose mastery
is in itself a reward?
There are great differences in the amount of in
tellectual curiosity shown by different people. Some
students seem to be almost continuously curious;
they want to know more about every new thing or
idea with which they come in contact —just for the
satisfaction that knowing gives. They are in a very
real sense the participants in the educational process.
Other people appear almost totally incurious. To
them, knowledge is something to be acquired only
to satisfy some arbitrary requirement. Their role is
that of the spectator, not the participant.
I believe that this quality of intellectual curiosity
is at least to some extent a habit of thinking that can
be cultivated. 1 believe that by training it can be in
creased and that such training is an important part
