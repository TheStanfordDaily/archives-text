# Secret Practices Set for Spartans
## 
### 
Secret practices for San Jose State
was the order of the day by Coach
Chuck Taylor yesterday. The Card
mentor announced that all preping
sessions for the Spartans would be
closed, and that all information
about personnel changes and new
plays would have to be cleared
through him personally.
"We're really tjoing to work hard
for this one," Taylor said, as the
coach indicated there were plenty
of new tricks up his sleeve for the
surprisingly strong San Jose eleven.
