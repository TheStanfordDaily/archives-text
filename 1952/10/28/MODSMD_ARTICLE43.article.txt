# Nine Teams Remain In Rose Bowl Race
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
The 1952 football season has now entered its seventh week of
play, which means that this is a good time to see which two
elevens will clash in the Rose Bowl game on Jan. 1, 1953.
Since the Pacific Coast Conference and the Western Confer
ence (Big Ten) have a contract that each will send a representa-

tive to Pasadena each New Year's - *
Day, the field is narrowed down to
>ome 18 teams. However, the an
nual autumnal elimination proceed-
I ings these teams partake in to de
! cide a champion has resulted in
| some very strange events, meaning
I that there is only a slight indication
j right now as to the identity of the
j two squads which will meet in the
Rose Bowl.
At this writing, the following j
I I'CC teams are eliminated from
; Rose Bowl contention: Oregon, '
Idaho, Oregon State, Washington
i State, and Stanford.
1 Out of it in the Big Ten are:
' Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and North
western.
But that still leaves nine or 50
per cent of the 18 teams in con
tention for the Rose Bowl berth.
A.s for the best bets in the race,
USC and UCLA hold the favorites'
laurels in the PCC, while Purdue
; and Michigan have the same posi
| tion in the Big Ten.
Both the Trojans and the Bruins
I boast unsullied season's records 1n
| conference and seasonal play, while
the Wolverines and Boilermakers
are unbeaten in league play, al- j
though both have black marks in j
their non-conference encounters.
In the dark horse role in the PCC
are California and Washington.
The Berkeley Bears were the
hot choice in pre-season forecasts,
hut dropped out of the leading I
role when USC blanked them last ;
Saturday. The Huskies got off to
j a had start, hut have taken two
! straight league wins to merit con
| sideration.
Wisconsin. Ohio State, and Min
nesota are the Midwest hall clubs
that hope to sneak in for the Cali
| fornia trip.
At this juncture, it is almost im
possible to separate the two PCC

elevens. They will have to do that
themselves when they meet on Nov
22. SC has to be accorded some edge
in Conference play, since they drop
ped Cal, while the Bruins and Bears
are yet to play. UCLA, however,
has a good intersectional record.
We'll call it dead even, and say
wait till the fourth Saturday of the
eleventh month.
Purdue has a slight advantage in
the Big Ten chase, but their big
test comes on Nov. 15, when the
Boilermakers and Wolverines col
lide at Ann Arbor.
Besides the Purdue tiff. Michi
gan must play Illinois and Ohio
State, very tough opposition.
Back to the Coast, Cal might
slip in if they beat UCLA and
their three remaining foes. Wash
ington also needs to win them all.
Wisconsin is the best dark horse
bet in the Big Ten. They play.
Northwestern, Indiana, and Minne
sota, but some of the top teams
must lose for the Badgers to tie.
A quick look at this week's PCC
games: Big clash is at Berkeley
when Cal and UCLA collide. Wash
ington plays Oregon State at Port
land, while Washington State and
Idaho renew their "nine-mile feud"
at Pullman.
In non - league tussles, Stanford
plays San Jose State, and Oregon
meets COP. USC takes the week
off.

The 1952 football season has now entered its seventh week of
play, which means that this is a good time to see which two
elevens will clash in the Rose Bowl game on Jan. 1, 1953.
Since the Pacific Coast Conference and the Western Confer
ence (Big Ten) have a contract that each will send a representa-

tive to Pasadena each New Year's - *
Day, the field is narrowed down to
>ome 18 teams. However, the an
nual autumnal elimination proceed-
I ings these teams partake in to de
! cide a champion has resulted in
| some very strange events, meaning
I that there is only a slight indication
j right now as to the identity of the
j two squads which will meet in the
Rose Bowl.
At this writing, the following j
I I'CC teams are eliminated from
; Rose Bowl contention: Oregon, '
Idaho, Oregon State, Washington
i State, and Stanford.
1 Out of it in the Big Ten are:
' Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and North
western.
But that still leaves nine or 50
per cent of the 18 teams in con
tention for the Rose Bowl berth.
A.s for the best bets in the race,
USC and UCLA hold the favorites'
laurels in the PCC, while Purdue
; and Michigan have the same posi
| tion in the Big Ten.
Both the Trojans and the Bruins
I boast unsullied season's records 1n
| conference and seasonal play, while
the Wolverines and Boilermakers
are unbeaten in league play, al- j
though both have black marks in j
their non-conference encounters.
In the dark horse role in the PCC
are California and Washington.
The Berkeley Bears were the
hot choice in pre-season forecasts,
hut dropped out of the leading I
role when USC blanked them last ;
Saturday. The Huskies got off to
j a had start, hut have taken two
! straight league wins to merit con
| sideration.
Wisconsin. Ohio State, and Min
nesota are the Midwest hall clubs
that hope to sneak in for the Cali
| fornia trip.
At this juncture, it is almost im
possible to separate the two PCC

elevens. They will have to do that
themselves when they meet on Nov
22. SC has to be accorded some edge
in Conference play, since they drop
ped Cal, while the Bruins and Bears
are yet to play. UCLA, however,
has a good intersectional record.
We'll call it dead even, and say
wait till the fourth Saturday of the
eleventh month.
Purdue has a slight advantage in
the Big Ten chase, but their big
test comes on Nov. 15, when the
Boilermakers and Wolverines col
lide at Ann Arbor.
Besides the Purdue tiff. Michi
gan must play Illinois and Ohio
State, very tough opposition.
Back to the Coast, Cal might
slip in if they beat UCLA and
their three remaining foes. Wash
ington also needs to win them all.
Wisconsin is the best dark horse
bet in the Big Ten. They play.
Northwestern, Indiana, and Minne
sota, but some of the top teams
must lose for the Badgers to tie.
A quick look at this week's PCC
games: Big clash is at Berkeley
when Cal and UCLA collide. Wash
ington plays Oregon State at Port
land, while Washington State and
Idaho renew their "nine-mile feud"
at Pullman.
In non - league tussles, Stanford
plays San Jose State, and Oregon
meets COP. USC takes the week
off.
