# PUNTS AND PITCHES
## The 						Unsung Heroes 
### Pete Grothe 
Today, a word about a squad that is probably the most publicity
malnutritioned of any on campus.
If one goes out to watch the footballers practice, he must go by a field
I<n which many men are kicking a ball. At first he might think that
these are football players, but on closer examination they are not wearing
pads, and their pants are short. Also, the bull is round.

The sport, chums, is soccer.
A soccer game ut Stanford has about the
same attendance as the main libe does dining
Big Game. Not so in Europe and in many
South American and Asian countries. A soc
cer game is to a European what a Sunday
double-header at Ebbets Field is to a Brook
lynite.
A peculiar situation exists here at Stan
ford. The soccer coach never can tell how
good his team will be until he knows how
many foreign students have matriculated to
the Farm. It's usually foreign students that
spark the team.
This year, for example, one of the stand-

outs is center forward Ron Hall, a transfer
from England's Oxford University. Hall, a graduate student in history,
was captain of the Oxford soccer team last year.
Another sparkplug is three-year letterman Harry liavilio, right half.
Havilio, who hails from Buenos Aire?*, was asked to try out for the
American Olympic team last year, until it was found out that he was an
Argentine citizen.
Bolivia has contributed two players to this cosmopolitan group. They
are Sam Suarez, "The best man on the team," according to Coach I>-o
Weinstein, left inside, and Carlos Miranda, left half.
Another player with class is right fullback Randy Rosso, who comes
from of all places . . . United States. Goalie Ben Swan is rated the best
in the conference and ceriterhalf Don Turner is probably the most im
proved player on the team.
Other boomers on the team are John Sentous, who could easily make
All-conference this year, Tom DeForest, Dick Konigsberger, and Earl
Anderson.
The coach, Leo Weinstein. is a versatile guy. He not only coaches
soccer, he also is an instructor in French and German.
The soccermen, who beat Cal, 4 to 2, last weekend, have a three and
one record, and for the first tinie in many years a good chance of topping
the conference. Their only real hurdle Ls USF, which was national runnerup
last year, and has been unbeaten in *11 consecutive conference games. The
team is confident that it can lick USF when it comes to Stanford in two
weeks.
And what's more, it hopes some people will he on hand to watch it.

Quickies. Orchids to Zeke Wallace, who is turning into a helluva good
cheerleader, the best since the one and only Dean Borba . . . Frankie
Albert led Stanford into the Rojse Bowl 12 years ago. Today, lie is still
the king for T formation quarterbacks. Anyone who saw the 49ers pul
verize Dallas at Kezar last Sunday will testify to that. Things don't change
much over the years. Twelve years ago, Albert was piloting the best
offense in the country; today, he's' doing the same thing ... on the pro
level.
The Stanford rooting section's enthusiastic vocalizing of the Chuck
Taylor yell after the Washington loss la.st Saturday was another classic
example of the Stanford Spirit.

the king for T formation quarterbacks. Anyone who saw the 49ers pul
verize Dallas at Kezar last Sunday will testify to that. Things don't change
much over the years. Twelve years ago, Albert was piloting the best
offense in the country; today, he's' doing the same thing ... on the pro
level.
The Stanford rooting section's enthusiastic vocalizing of the Chuck
Taylor yell after the Washington loss la.st Saturday was another classic
example of the Stanford Spirit.

Today, a word about a squad that is probably the most publicity
malnutritioned of any on campus.
If one goes out to watch the footballers practice, he must go by a field
I<n which many men are kicking a ball. At first he might think that
these are football players, but on closer examination they are not wearing
pads, and their pants are short. Also, the bull is round.

The sport, chums, is soccer.
A soccer game ut Stanford has about the
same attendance as the main libe does dining
Big Game. Not so in Europe and in many
South American and Asian countries. A soc
cer game is to a European what a Sunday
double-header at Ebbets Field is to a Brook
lynite.
A peculiar situation exists here at Stan
ford. The soccer coach never can tell how
good his team will be until he knows how
many foreign students have matriculated to
the Farm. It's usually foreign students that
spark the team.
This year, for example, one of the stand-

outs is center forward Ron Hall, a transfer
from England's Oxford University. Hall, a graduate student in history,
was captain of the Oxford soccer team last year.
Another sparkplug is three-year letterman Harry liavilio, right half.
Havilio, who hails from Buenos Aire?*, was asked to try out for the
American Olympic team last year, until it was found out that he was an
Argentine citizen.
Bolivia has contributed two players to this cosmopolitan group. They
are Sam Suarez, "The best man on the team," according to Coach I>-o
Weinstein, left inside, and Carlos Miranda, left half.
Another player with class is right fullback Randy Rosso, who comes
from of all places . . . United States. Goalie Ben Swan is rated the best
in the conference and ceriterhalf Don Turner is probably the most im
proved player on the team.
Other boomers on the team are John Sentous, who could easily make
All-conference this year, Tom DeForest, Dick Konigsberger, and Earl
Anderson.
The coach, Leo Weinstein. is a versatile guy. He not only coaches
soccer, he also is an instructor in French and German.
The soccermen, who beat Cal, 4 to 2, last weekend, have a three and
one record, and for the first tinie in many years a good chance of topping
the conference. Their only real hurdle Ls USF, which was national runnerup
last year, and has been unbeaten in *11 consecutive conference games. The
team is confident that it can lick USF when it comes to Stanford in two
weeks.
And what's more, it hopes some people will he on hand to watch it.
