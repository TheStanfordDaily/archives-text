# Mermen Host San Jose State
## 
### 
Stanford's mermen take to the
water this afternoon against San
Jose State at the Encinu Gym pool
| at 4:30.
The non-league tilt marks a re
j turn to action after a week's lay-off
: from a southern trip that brought
| victory over USC and a loss against
jUCLA.
The Cards, PCC champs last year,
opened their water polo season with
Siato on Oct. 8 and downed them
4-3 at the latter's pool.
Despite a 1 and 2 record in Con
j ference play, Coach Tom Haynie
! expects his team to make a tight
of it.
