# '48 vs. '52: Will the Pollsters Miss Again?
## 
### DAVID WONG 
With their 1948 failure still fresh in mind, political pollsters in
the last few weeks have again been devoting their time and energy
in an attempt to discover the political preference of the American
public in the coming Presidential election. And as election day
draws near, the pollsters undoubtedly will try again to predict
its outcome.

Dut how reliable will the predic
tions be? Will the pollsters do bet
ter this time? Have they profited
from their pa t mistakes which were
pointed out to them by various so
cial rcientLts, or are they still using
the rule of thumb methods which
led to their 1!)-18 downfall?
In an attempt to find answers to
the above questions, interviews
were conducted with three experts
in the field of public opinion and
political behavior and one profes
sional pollster. The people inter
viewed were Dr. Chilton R. Bush,
chairman of the Stanford Institute
of Journalistic Studies; Dr. Alfred
de Grazia, executive officer of the
Committee for Research in Social
Sciences: Dr. Richard VV. Gable, of
the Political Science Department;
and Alee Gallup, a graduate stu
dent in journalism, who has worked
with bis father, Dr. George Gallup,

in the conducting of polls.
()uota Method Critirizrd
According to these experts, one of
the major weaknesses of the 1948
polls was the use of the qtiota
method of polling. The shortcoming
of the quota method lies in the fact
that there is no real control over
the interviewers in the selection of
their respondents, and thus the
quota sample ceases to be a truly
random sample. This method has
led to an under-rcpresentation of
the lower economic groupings in the
samples, which in turn has brought
about what is commonly known as
the "Republican bias" of the polls.
Dr. dc Grazia and Dr. Gable
pointed out that as far as sampling
is concerned, other methods of sam
pling like random selection would
give a truer picture. However, such
methods are also more costly and
more time consuming, and, since tiic
pollsters are commercial organiza

lions, there is a reluctance to intro
duce these more costly techniques.
Alec Gallup said, on the other
hand, the pollsters are aware of the
inadequacy of the quota method,
and increasing stress is now being
placed on pin-point sampling, which
is a sort of area sampling.
Two other major weaknesses of
the 1948 polls manifested themselves
in the allocation of the undecided
voters and in the failure to foresee
the shift of voters from one candi
date to another. The pollsters as
sumed in 1948 that the undecided
voters would distribute themselves
in the same way as the decided vot
ers, but of course this proved to be
wrong.
"Shifting Voter" Problem
As far as the shifting voter is con
cerned, the pollsters excused them
selves by saying that the voter told
them one thing and then proceeded
to do something else, thus causing

the errors in their predictions. But
as Daniel Katz, program director of
the Survey Research Center of the
University of Michigan, pointed out,
last-minute shifts do not excuse the
pollsters because they are under
obligation either to predict such
shifts or to state that their predic
tions are liable to a certain amount
of variation* due to the instability of
political preference.
Dr. Bush said the best method for
solving these two problems is by re
lating them to the basic issues of
the campaign, but he did not know
if the pollsters are doing that. In
1948, Dr. Bush was one of the few
people who warned the pollsters
that they would fail in their predic
tions if they continued to use the
same basis for prediction as they
had done in the past.
He gave as his reason the fact that
Roosevelt was no longer running in
1948. Roosevelt was such a strong
character that there was an early
polarization of voters and the cam
paign really did little to change vot
ing behavior. The pollsters failed to
take that into account.
"Party " Question Introduced
Gallup said in order to apportion
the undecided voters more accurate
ly and to take into account any pos
sible shifts, the pollsters are now
engaging in depth interviewing.
'I his year, the pollsters have also
introduced a "party" question,
which worked quite successfully in
Europe. The' voter is asked which
party he prefers to win and differ

ences have been noted between the
answers to this question and a ques
tion on the candidate.
So far the Gallup polls have been
distributing the undecided voters on
a three-to-onc basis—three Demo
crats to every Republican — which
was roughly the way the undecided
voters cast their votes in 1948. How
ever, Dr. de Grazia and Dr. Gable
pointed out that such division is still
not scientific in that it is not based
upon any theory.
Another major difficulty which
confronted the pollsters in 1948 —
and one which still confronts them
—was that they had to make their
predictions upon an estimated turn
out of voters. This has always been
a problem in the United States
where the number of eligible voters
far exceeds the number who actu
ally vote.
Forecasting Difficulties
Dr. Bush said when a pollster
measures consumption of breakfast
food, he can be sure that practically
every member of the sample is an
actual consumer. But when he tries
to forecast political behavior, he has
no sure way to know what percent
age the turnout will be.
However, Gallup said the deter
mination of the turnout for the
election is relatively simple and is
worked out on the basis of the New
York City registration figures. The
pollsters have already fixed the

turnout figures at 55,000,000 for the
coming election.
Commenting qn the polls in gen
eral, Dr. Gable said the major fault
of the pollsters in 1948-whs that
they attempted to forecast on the
basis of inadequate evidence. He
said the professional polls do not
contribute much to the understand
ing of the political process. How
ever, the polls do serve a function
in that they asl; questions continu
ally and as a result trends in public
opinion and the effect of events
upon attitudes can be noted.
Oversimplification Pointed Out
Dr. de Crazia said the polls tend
to oversimplify issues and often give
the public a voice that often does
not cxi.-.t. The polls are fairly good
for a general sounding of opinion,
especially if people arc aware of the
subject talked about, but the in
struments the pollsters possess are
less good for predicting elections
than for anything else.
He thinks the pollsters will make
predictions again, in flic coming
election, but they will also hedge.
If the pollsters are more accurate
this time it will be because they arc
very lucky and not because of any
crcat improvement in their meth
ods.
Dr. Bu: h said that even when the
polls miss the correct answers, they
are conducted much more scientifi
cally than just having a newspapev
man ask a few people for their opin
ions. Also, on social questions, the
expression of opinion in the polls is
more representative of what people
think than the impression given by
well-organized pressure groups.
Polls Not Pcrfcct. But . . .
Gallup said polls aid in the under
standing of the democratic process
and they give the people in govern
ment a knowledge of popular opin
ion. Before polls were used only
lobbies and pressure groups made
themselves felt. He said the polls

are by no means perfect, but they
are the best thing available so far.
As far as the progress of the cam
paign is concerned, Gallup said
there is a definite shift toward Ste
venson and the shift is increasing
all the time. Whether Stevenson
will win or not depends on whether
he can catch up by election day.
There is a likelihood, Gallup added,
that the pollsters will not make pre
dictions this time, but will rather
just present the figures and let the
public do its own intei|xretin;j.
