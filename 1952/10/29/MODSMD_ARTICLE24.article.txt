NEW YORK, Oct. 28 (UP)-Dwight D. Eisen
hower loosed a double barreled blast at the Tru
man administration, charging that the Truman
administration "abdicated" a strong American
position in Korea in 1949, then used "lop secret"

but out-of-date military documents
during the Presidential campaign as
an attempted alibi.
Eisenhower also charged that
Gov. Adlax E. Stevenson apparently
thinks he knows more about Korea
than any other American "without
having to go there."
Angered at Stevenson's declara
tion that the Eisenhower pledge to
visit Korea "may have delayed an
armistice," the Republican Presi
dential nominee told a crowd of
3.000 at Queens Borough Hall:
"Just ask any veteran if he ever
saw a VIP (very important person)
who knew anything about the bat
tlefront unless be came up to take a
look at it,"
"lhe Republican Presidential nom
inee. in a nationally televised ques
tion and answer program, said that
the administration blamed the Joint
Chiefs of Staff foi the decision to
get out of Korea on the basis of a
"top secret" military estimate they
made in 1947 lha* the U.S. military
occupation of South Korea was "not
essentia!" to the nation's military
security.
Then he declared that there was
actually not much connection be
tween what he considered a purely
military estimate of 194V am! "a ci
vilian political decision *wo
years later . . . on a different sub
ject."
