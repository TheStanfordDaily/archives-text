# Fight for Intellectual Freedom
## 
### 
Intellectual freedom is fiyhting for its life in
America today. It is fighting a great gray cloud
of fear which keeps men irom saying what they
think.
Democratic society has no meaning unless
this fight is won. Popular government has no
meaning without the right to think and speak
freely.
The light for intellectual freedom is currently
centered on one man: Joseph McCarthy,' the
senator from Wisconsin ... a man Dwight Eisen
hower has incluc-;a in his blanket endorsement
of the Republican candidates for Congress.
McCarthy's irresponsible charges have
contributed to the current atmosphere of fear
and timidity. His speech Wednesday night
vsas typical: guilt by association, hazy docu
mentation, emotionalism. And his recoid con
tinues to stand that none of the men he has
attacked has been convinced.
Those who support him praise his battle
against Communism. But they fail to draw the
line between two possible kinds of battles.
1. A continuing fight against representatives,
o! a foreign power which is seeking to over
throw our government carried on justly and

legally by the FBI and other qualified agencies
. . . the fight which Governor Stevenson has
promised to continue.
2. An irresponsible labelling as "a Commu
nist" everyone whose views differ from one's
own—the kind of technique McCarthy uses.
Opposing the status quo does not mean one
is a Russian Communist, and this fact should
not be overlooked.
We can see no valid excuse lor supporting
Senator McCarthy. By doing so, General Eisen
hower is giving direct backing to the forces
which are destroying intellectual freedom in
this country.
The General might well follow the example
of Governor Stevenson, who this week publicly
disowned Senator Pat McCarran, author of the
highly questionable immigration act. It is in
teresting to note that at least one of the candi
dates m this election is not willing to compro
* mise with his principles in his anxiety over
party unity.
Senator McCarthy's overwhelming victory in
Wisconsin was onefcf the most appalling and
disillusioning events in recent history. If the
man who supports him wins next week, it may
well be another. —Dorothy Dodge
