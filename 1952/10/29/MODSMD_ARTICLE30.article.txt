# The 						Vote for Peace
## 
### 
li'e time for another "old soldier" to fade
away. Last Friday night in Detioit, General
Eisenhower figuratively loaded his guns and
announced that he himself would go to Korea
to conclude the conflict there.
Stating that one of the first jobs of a new
administration would be to settle the Korean
issue, the General proceeded to describe just
how he would go about this task!
"That job requires a personal trip to Korea.
I shall make that trip. Only in that way could
J. learn how best to serve the American people
in the cause of peace.
"1 shall go to Korea."
The obstacles to such a trip are so obviously
restrictive that we feel sure the General realizes
them, too. Why then did he make such a
pledge? Was it A sincere, though naive, plan
for peace, or a calculated bid for votes?
A cursory examination of llxe proposed ex
pedition leveals the following:
Such an excursion by the President of the
United States would not only lower the prestige

of this country, but also magnify the Korean
War's danger to the United States in the eyes
of other countries. Furthermore, any president
exposing himself to an area like Korea "would be
taking far too great a personal risk.
A solution of the Korean conflict certainly re
quires conference with the men on the scene,
which can be done in Washington as well as
Korea. But General Eisenhower says that the
only way he can conclude the war is to make
a personal trip to Korea. Here is yet another
indication of the military man approach as con
trasted with that of the statesman.
Furthermore, the abilities of Generals Mark
Clark and Van Fleet have been well proven.
The presence of General Eisenhower in the
field is un-called for.
We are just an anxious for conclusion of the
war in Korea as General Eisenhower must be.
However, we do not feel that the General was
sincere in his plan to go to the battleground
itself. We feel that Eisenhower was after votes
first, peace second. â€”Mary Massey
