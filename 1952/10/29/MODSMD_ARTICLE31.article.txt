# State Issues: 7 and 13
## 
### 
In the heat of the national election campaign
and in a school as isolated from the gossip of
local politics as Stanford, state issues have been
generally neglected.
However, California's hodge-podge consti
tution invariably stimulates a flood of initiative
and referendum proposals to amend, and this
year is no exception. The California ballot lists
24 propositions, tho majority of which are pro
prosed amendments to the constitution.
Since many of these propositions warrant
considerable explanation and thought, this will
be the first of several Daily articles and edi
torials regarding them.
Reorganization of the ballot is the concern
oi two propositions. Number 13, an initiative
to the legislature, proposes to eliminate Cali
fornia's cross filing system. Number 7, a legis
lature proposed alternative to 13, calls for desig
nation of party membership of all candidates
for partisan office.
When it was first introduced, cross filing was
opposed by leading party regulars, the bosses,
since it took away a measure of their contiol
over party nominations.
By opening either party's ballot to whomever
desired to file so that voters could vote for
whichever candidate they wished, the legis
lators more completely fulfilled the intent of
the direct primary: to take partisan nominations
out of smoke filled rooms and rigged conven
tions and put them in the hands of the people.
However, in recent years a legitimate com
plaint has arisen that some candidates were
cross filing to masquerade as half Democrat and
half Republican. Many smokescreen nomina
tions have been accomplished by this device

of calling black horses while horses.
Consequently, the cry has arisen to prohibit
cross filing. This to us seems to attempt to
correct an evil by returning to a far worse evil.
An example of misguided reactionism.
Since in California a voter is given a primary
ballot according to his registration declaration
of party affiliation, if cross filing were pro
hibited, a Republican could no longer vote for
a Democrat if he thought the Democrat better
qualified.
More applicable, an independent voter who
indicates a nominal party affiliation in order
to be able to vote in the primary would be pre
vented from voting for the candidate he desires.
The independent would be frozen out of the
primary.
Far more constructive, we believe, is the
legislature sponsored proposal number 7,
which provides a realistic solution by requir
ing party designation of all candidates for par
tisan offices on the primary as well as final
ballot.
This does not call for so designating candi
dates for those local offices which in California
are, by law, non partisan.
It will eliminate smokescreen while still leav
ing voters free to vote for the candidate of their
choice. Smokescreens will be cleared away.
Piinted on the ballot following the candidates
name will be his party affiliation. No voter will
have excuse to vote for a man blindly.
Therefore, as part and parcel of efforts to in
sure constructive and democratic government
we urge a vote of "NO" on pioposition 13 and
a vote "YES" on proposition 7.—Jim Madison

It will eliminate smokescreen while still leav
ing voters free to vote for the candidate of their
choice. Smokescreens will be cleared away.
Piinted on the ballot following the candidates
name will be his party affiliation. No voter will
have excuse to vote for a man blindly.
Therefore, as part and parcel of efforts to in
sure constructive and democratic government
we urge a vote of "NO" on pioposition 13 and
a vote "YES" on proposition 7.—Jim Madison
In the heat of the national election campaign
and in a school as isolated from the gossip of
local politics as Stanford, state issues have been
generally neglected.
However, California's hodge-podge consti
tution invariably stimulates a flood of initiative
and referendum proposals to amend, and this
year is no exception. The California ballot lists
24 propositions, tho majority of which are pro
prosed amendments to the constitution.
Since many of these propositions warrant
considerable explanation and thought, this will
be the first of several Daily articles and edi
torials regarding them.
Reorganization of the ballot is the concern
oi two propositions. Number 13, an initiative
to the legislature, proposes to eliminate Cali
fornia's cross filing system. Number 7, a legis
lature proposed alternative to 13, calls for desig
nation of party membership of all candidates
for partisan office.
When it was first introduced, cross filing was
opposed by leading party regulars, the bosses,
since it took away a measure of their contiol
over party nominations.
By opening either party's ballot to whomever
desired to file so that voters could vote for
whichever candidate they wished, the legis
lators more completely fulfilled the intent of
the direct primary: to take partisan nominations
out of smoke filled rooms and rigged conven
tions and put them in the hands of the people.
However, in recent years a legitimate com
plaint has arisen that some candidates were
cross filing to masquerade as half Democrat and
half Republican. Many smokescreen nomina
tions have been accomplished by this device

of calling black horses while horses.
Consequently, the cry has arisen to prohibit
cross filing. This to us seems to attempt to
correct an evil by returning to a far worse evil.
An example of misguided reactionism.
Since in California a voter is given a primary
ballot according to his registration declaration
of party affiliation, if cross filing were pro
hibited, a Republican could no longer vote for
a Democrat if he thought the Democrat better
qualified.
More applicable, an independent voter who
indicates a nominal party affiliation in order
to be able to vote in the primary would be pre
vented from voting for the candidate he desires.
The independent would be frozen out of the
primary.
Far more constructive, we believe, is the
legislature sponsored proposal number 7,
which provides a realistic solution by requir
ing party designation of all candidates for par
tisan offices on the primary as well as final
ballot.
This does not call for so designating candi
dates for those local offices which in California
are, by law, non partisan.
It will eliminate smokescreen while still leav
ing voters free to vote for the candidate of their
choice. Smokescreens will be cleared away.
Piinted on the ballot following the candidates
