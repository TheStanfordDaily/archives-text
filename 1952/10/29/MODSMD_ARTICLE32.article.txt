To the Editor:
In the Daily of Oct. 28. you printed a letter by one
Richard H. Pantell. I wish to congratulate Mr. Pan
tellr—his letter was written in the glorious tradition
of the Donald E. Close school that has been so long
dead. It has been over a year since 1 have been able
to pick up my morning paper, read that the "FEPC
is undesirable, for every job given to a member of a
minority group deprives a deserving natural-born
American from an income," and* proceed to spray
half-swallowed coffee at those around me at the
breakfast table.
Oil one point, Mr. Pantell seems to be unin
formed. The FEPC would make employers' hire the
man with the most ability, regardless of race or
religion. Now I am sure that Mr. Pantell would
agree that no member of a minority race or religion
could possibly be as able as a "deserving natural
boru American," a member of the great, aryan ma
jority. Therefore, his argument seems to lack the
punch that the man of his "obvious superior in
telligence" could have given it.
In addition to the above and other comments, he
on to take note of the fact that support for
jfiiisenhower in a poll hold recently by the Daily was
greatest among freshmen and weakest among grad
students. He adds, "My alternatives are to reject the
General or to accept my inferior mental status. Is it
possible tluit your manner of poll-taking was in
valid?"
Is it possible that the alternatives Mr. Pantell set
for himself were very well chosen?
