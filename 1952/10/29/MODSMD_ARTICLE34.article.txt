# Funny Reading

### 
To the Editor: , !
In regard to Mr. Pantell's opus of yesterday, may I :
submit that this is the funniest reading (with the j
exception of Little Man on Campus) 1 have done in ;
a long time. • 1
And yet there is something frightening about the I
glibness with which this Republican speaks. Like
Democrats, varyinj* Republicans make varying de
grees of sense. And Mr. Pantell makes as little sense
as does anyone whom I have seen in print.
"FEPC is undesirable, for every job given to a j
member of a minority group deprives a deserving j
natural-born American from an income."
1 agree wholeheartedly. Therefore, let us remove ;
all Catholics, Jews, Negroes, Whites, Scotch, Irish, 1
ad nauseum from their jobs, and give the jobs thus |
obtained to the "deserving, natural-born American"— '
the so-called "American Indian." "1 go Osage," oi !
"Cree for Me."
