To the Editor:
Is it a matter of policy for the Stanford Daily to
allow one person to express the views of "thousands"
of voters? In Walt Menninger's editorial entitled
"Taft ami Ike—Analysis of 'Surrender'" of Oct. 28,
Mr. Menninger frequently refered to the words "we"
and "us," eleven times to be exact. These words
imply that more than one person is speaking his
views; I see but a single signature attached to the
editorial.
It is my conviction that editorials which express
only one writer's beliefs should be phrased in the
singular case. Let's not jump to gross conclusions
that everybody sees the same views as the writer.
Also an editorial should express the views of the
editor and not the start as a whole. If the staff
does support the editorial, let them sign it. L«t's not
have misleading editorials in our campus paper.
—ALLEN L. McNITT
(Editor's note: The Daily repeats what is ex
plained at the beginning of the quarter: political
editorials reflect the opinion of the writer, not the
paper as a whole. Editorials are traditionally
written in the first person plural; Header McNitt
is privileged to campaign against this tradition if
he wishes.)
