# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
WEDNESDAY MORNING ROUNDUP
I strode into the Daily Shack the day before yes
terday, finished off the last few bars of "Mr. Cal
laghan," and sat down to wring sweet symphonies
of words from my typewriter. Whereupon the phone
rang.
"Hello," I began simply enough.
"I am not engaged," said the girl's voice at the
other end of the line.

"Huh?" I allowed.
"I am not engaged," she em
phatically repeated.
For a moment I thought that
I had broken in on "Portia's
Other Life" or something. It
is not often that one picks lip
the phone and is bluntly in
formed that the voice on the
other end of the line is not en
gaged.
Now, this is a helluva situa-

uation. Just what does one say when someone else
whom you don't know informs you that she is not
engaged. Do you rejoice or express sorrow? Now,
1 am all for love. I think it is a good thing and
that nothing will ever replace it. And so I ex
pressed my sympathies.
"But don't you see?" she went on. "It's all a
fraternity prank."
And so, dear reader, this is why you read in

yesterday's Daily: "CORRECTION: Toni Stevens and
Joe Plateau are not engaged as was printed in
yesterday's Daily."

SECOND BEST. Rumor has it that one of the
fraternities required a pledge to gel Governor War
ren's daughter's autograph during Hell Week. The
pledge (1) went to Sacramento, (2) climbed over the
fence of the Governor's mansion, (3) ripped his pants,
»(4) was stopped by a guard, (5) got the guard's sig
nature instead.
* * *
SEEN IN HOOVER TOWER DEPT: Several Re
publicans were shocked to find an elevator operator
in Hoover Tower wearing a Stevenson button.*

MORE POLITICS. The football coaching staff is
having a hard time keeping its mind on football.
Every meeting on football strategy seems to end on
the subject of politics. Line Coach Joe Reutz, the
best orator in the group, is fighting a losing battle.
He is the only Democrat and keeps chiding Chuck,
"Ever since you got that raise in pay, you became a
Republican."
, * * t- *
HARD TO PLEASE. When Frosh Coach Bob
Ghilotti was questioned how l>is frosh team looked
when it was leading UCLA 42 to 0 at the half, he
moaned, "Terrible, terrible."

MORE POLITICS. The football coaching staff is

Every meeting on football strategy seems to end on
the subject of politics. Line Coach Joe Reutz, the
best orator in the group, is fighting a losing battle.
He is the only Democrat and keeps chiding Chuck,
"Ever since you got that raise in pay, you became a
Republican."

WEDNESDAY MORNING ROUNDUP
I strode into the Daily Shack the day before yes
terday, finished off the last few bars of "Mr. Cal
laghan," and sat down to wring sweet symphonies
of words from my typewriter. Whereupon the phone
rang.
"Hello," I began simply enough.
"I am not engaged," said the girl's voice at the
other end of the line.

"Huh?" I allowed.
"I am not engaged," she em
phatically repeated.
For a moment I thought that
I had broken in on "Portia's
Other Life" or something. It
is not often that one picks lip
the phone and is bluntly in
formed that the voice on the
other end of the line is not en
gaged.
Now, this is a helluva situa-

uation. Just what does one say when someone else
whom you don't know informs you that she is not
engaged. Do you rejoice or express sorrow? Now,
1 am all for love. I think it is a good thing and
that nothing will ever replace it. And so I ex
pressed my sympathies.
"But don't you see?" she went on. "It's all a
fraternity prank."
And so, dear reader, this is why you read in

yesterday's Daily: "CORRECTION: Toni Stevens and
Joe Plateau are not engaged as was printed in
yesterday's Daily."
