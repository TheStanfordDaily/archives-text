# Stanford: ‘Right Place to Come’
## Spirit Praised By Britisher 
### BOB REZAK 
To Chris Arnold the West
seemed like "the right place to
come."
And so did Stanford.
When Arnold, 27-year-old
architecture major from England,
was invited to study in the
United States under the IFC Tar
vcr Scholar exchange program,
it was the reputation of both
places that influenced his final
selection.
"California has a good reputation
in England," lie said, "and we think
of it as a place where we would
all like to go. The East witli Yale
and Harvard also has tremendous
appeal, but I didn't want to go there
to see the same people I've seen in
England."
Surprisingly well versed in
Stanford life for (he short month
lie has been here, Arnold had a
lot to say about his impressions
of Stanford and (be United States
in general.
"It's a terrific change and just
what I needed," he exclaimed. "How

different it is—the whole atmos
phere, climate, spirit of the country
—it's amazingly different, but amaz
ing in the right way."
One such difference he noted
was in the women.
"The English girl who goes to
college," he said with a smile, '"is
not as renowned for womanly
qualities."
Another American p a s t i m c .
fool hall, also drew some exciting

I comments from Hie Eivjlidt stu-
I dent.
"Football is fabulous — the tre
mendous sci.le of it all, the organi
zation, and the people you qet to
turn oul. We have nothing like that
in England."
"The lirsl thing that really hits
one is a sort of community spirit
you have here—people heiny a part
of the University," he said. "One
feels really glad to he known as a
| Stanford student."
Arnold has found time to take an
active if not a partisan interest in
I American polities. He has hoard and
seen both Presidential candidates
J through arrangements made by the
University's foreign stuaent admin
istration.
"Politics here," he related, "are a
'4ood bit livelier than back home.
The people here regard it as a sort
! of entertainment."
In England, he said, I)vvh:ht Ei
senhower is "very popular" and is
i "almost the number one person
ality." The people don't know
much about Adlai (Stevenson)
I luit he is the sort of personality
that appeals to the Engli-liMastc—
: more the English style of intellec
tual.
"Since the foreign policy program
is important to the English," Ar
nold declared, "the general feel in.i;
would be in favor of a Democratic
| victory. On the other hand, we like
j Ike as a person, so it all balances
lout in the final analysis."
