# 'Murder' Rates Applause

### RON ROSEN 
I'or their first offering litis
season, the Stanford Players
presented T. S. Elliot's Twen
tieth Century allegory, "Mur
der in the Cathedral."
The play is based on the his
torical conflict of Thomas a Bet
kct, the Archbishop of Canter
bury and King Henry II of Fug
land. 'Hie plot characterizes Hie
old conflict between the Church
and State when Becket, after
living a life of worldly glory in
the service of the King, disobeys
his king and is exiled to France.
He returns to England and is
subsequently killed by the King's
men.
But more than the conflict be
tween the spiritual and the tem
poral is involved..
Eliot's use of verse is extremely
well suited to pointing up cli
maxes and intense emotional
situations. By merely changing
Ihc rhythm, or by process of
rhyming these situations arc; com
municated to the listener.
Under the very ahlo direc
tion of 1 heodorc Marcu.se, one
received a good realization of
Eliot's deep - seated meanings.
Marcuse separated sections of
the women's chorus and as
signed to individuals, which
seemed to strengthen Eliot's
lines rather than weaken them.
Clayton Garrison was a very
impressive Archbishop. He was
always in the character of the
religious martyr, hut he never
over-played the piety of Becket.
The Four Tempters were all ex
cellent, as were the three priests
but one of fhr outstanding fea
tures of tbc performance was the
fine unison work of the women's
chorus.
In all "Murder" makes for a
very interesting and enjoyable,
if a trifle confusing, eyening.


"MURDER IN THE CATHEDRAL" —Clayton Garrison, as Thom
as a Becket, talks with his priests before his assassination in the
Stanford Players' production of Eliot's verse drama. The play
