PHILADELPHIA. Oct. 29 (UP) -
Ciov. Adlai E. Stevenson denounced
(ren. Dwight D. Eisenhower's Ko
rean peace trip plan today as a de
liberate move to "play politics with
peace" in a "cynical bid for votes"
which "will neither solve our prob
lems nor win the election."
The Democratic Presidential can
didate said it was a complete re
versal of bis Republican rival's posi
tion last June and"he is gambling
'bat Hie American people will not
remember what he said four months
ago.''
Stevenson burled the charge in
a "whistle-stop" speech at Beth
lehem. Pa., as he campaigned
across eastern Pennsylvania.
The Bethlehem speech provided
perhaps Stevenson's strongest per
sonal attack so far on the former
five-:;tar general who is his oppo
nent m next Tuesday's Presidential
election.
Striking particularly a< ELen-
I>ower's announced plan to make a
personal trip to Korea to settle the
war. if be is elected, Stevenson de
nounce! i ( a "slick'* and com
pletely unworkable idea to catch
votes.
He recalled that las* June 5 Ei
venhowcr expressed an opinion
that (here Mas "no clear-cut an
swc"" to the Korean war — tha<
(he I'nited States could not pull
out nor waec a decisive attack,
an«t could only stand firm and try
for a decent armistice.
"Now i< is almost November and
now lie says tha* he can solve this
problem with speed and with hon
or." Stevenson challenged.
