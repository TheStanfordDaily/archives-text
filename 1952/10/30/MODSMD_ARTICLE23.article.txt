# McCarthyism—A Greater Significance
## 
### 
Joe McCarthy is a problem He's a problem
for Democrats and Republicans alike. He's a
problem for the country. As a problem, he de
serves some intelliqent, objective considera
tion, rather than an emotional condemnation.
We cannot avoid ihe issue of McCarthyism
nor can we simply condemn it for existinq. The
fact is it does exist! And be we professors, or
students or editorial writers, we must recoy
nize it for its social significance as well as its
ethical significance.
What about McCarthyism? It does, we
agree, reverse the practiced legal procedures
by declaring a man is guilty until proven in
nocent. But McCarthy represents more than
an individual. He represents a phenomenon
created by our times —times which have been
administered laiqely by Democrats.
Furthermore McCarthy must be recognized
as being representative of a considerable seg
ment of the population. If you think not, re
read the results in Wisconcin. This feeling is
not restricted to Wisconsin. It can be found in
any state in the union.
We cannot deny the existence of this feel
ing, and we must not underestimate it.
Whether we think it right or wrong, intelli
gent or stupid, good or bad, it's still there!
The job at hand is to attempt to ameliorate
this situation.
Therefore the problem resolves itself into the
question, what can we do? SinA; we are not
all voters in the state of Wisconsin, only two
alternatives are currently presented to us. We
can elect another Democratic administration
(which tends to pass olf or disregard McCarthy
ism), or a new Republican administration ( which
accepts McCarthyism).
What will happen if Stevenson is elected?
Will McCarthyism diminish? We have no in
dication whatsoever that it will. As long as the
Senator from Wisconsin is outside ths admin
istration*and his party is not culpable, he will,
v/e are sure, holler to his heart's content. As
long as there is no complete change through
out the administration, Joe and his followers
will continue their present policy. This is, in
our opinion, undesirable.
What will happen if Eisenhower i3 elected?
A new administration, a Republican adminis
tration will be in power. McCarthy will neces
sarily tone down his attacks; and he will have
to fit his attitudes to those ol the Republican
administration.

In other words, it the Democrats are re
turned to power, there will be no controlling
of McCarthy. He remains the "equal" of any
other critic of government. If the Republicans
are elected, McCarthy will have a party su
perior—Dwight Eisenhower.
And what about Eisenhower? He has "sup
ported" McCarthy. In this matter, we question
Ike's judgment, since we feel he did make a
mistake in endorsing McCarthy. However, this
is not to be confused with "accepting" Mc-
Carthy. We would never give Joe McCarthy
our support, for we don't agree with his meth
ods; but we believe we must necessarily ac
cept him. To do otherwise is to dispute the
facts.
While we question Eisenhower's judgment,
we believe it goes without question that he is
supporting McCarthy not as an endorsement
of the Senator's actions or his opinions, but
rather because he is a member cf the same po
litical party. Ike has again and again stated
that he will not condone the actions which so
typify McCarthy.
Thus we do not believe that it will be an
"appalling and disillusioning event" if Eisen
hower is elected president. We recognize with
greater confidence the editorial words of the
non-partisan Christian Science Monitor of Oct.
9:
"He (Eisenhower) has denounced unAmeri
can methods of rooting out Communism and
firmly restrained those who would have ex
ploited the Bedell Smith story with a witch hunt
for campaign purposes . . . Certainly the re
sponsibilities of office should exert restraint on
certain Republicans whose long 'sojourn in the
wilderness' of opposition has seemed to induce
a desperate recklessness."
I
We firmly believe that the return of the
Democratic administration to power will only
continue this "recklessness." The necessary
step toward solution of the problem is a
change in administration.
And while we question Eisenhower's support
for McCarthy, we applaud the General's action
in recognizing the social implications of the
Wisconsin senator, and accepting him. We con
gratulate the Republican nominee for not
naively passing off this phenomenon — one
which represents a larger segment of the popu
lation than most intellectuals would have us
believe.—Walt Menninger

We cannot deny the existence of this feel
ing, and we must not underestimate it.
Whether we think it right or wrong, intelli
gent or stupid, good or bad, it's still there!
The job at hand is to attempt to ameliorate
this situation.
Therefore the problem resolves itself into the
question, what can we do? SinA; we are not
all voters in the state of Wisconsin, only two
alternatives are currently presented to us. We
can elect another Democratic administration
(which tends to pass olf or disregard McCarthy
ism), or a new Republican administration ( which
accepts McCarthyism).
What will happen if Stevenson is elected?
Will McCarthyism diminish? We have no in
dication whatsoever that it will. As long as the
Senator from Wisconsin is outside ths admin
istration*and his party is not culpable, he will,
v/e are sure, holler to his heart's content. As
long as there is no complete change through
out the administration, Joe and his followers
will continue their present policy. This is, in
our opinion, undesirable.
What will happen if Eisenhower i3 elected?
A new administration, a Republican adminis
tration will be in power. McCarthy will neces
sarily tone down his attacks; and he will have
to fit his attitudes to those ol the Republican
administration.

In other words, it the Democrats are re
turned to power, there will be no controlling
of McCarthy. He remains the "equal" of any
other critic of government. If the Republicans
are elected, McCarthy will have a party su
perior—Dwight Eisenhower.
And what about Eisenhower? He has "sup
ported" McCarthy. In this matter, we question
Ike's judgment, since we feel he did make a
mistake in endorsing McCarthy. However, this
is not to be confused with "accepting" Mc-
Carthy. We would never give Joe McCarthy
our support, for we don't agree with his meth
ods; but we believe we must necessarily ac
cept him. To do otherwise is to dispute the
facts.
While we question Eisenhower's judgment,
we believe it goes without question that he is
supporting McCarthy not as an endorsement
of the Senator's actions or his opinions, but
rather because he is a member cf the same po
litical party. Ike has again and again stated
that he will not condone the actions which so
typify McCarthy.
Thus we do not believe that it will be an
"appalling and disillusioning event" if Eisen
hower is elected president. We recognize with
greater confidence the editorial words of the
non-partisan Christian Science Monitor of Oct.
9:
"He (Eisenhower) has denounced unAmeri
can methods of rooting out Communism and
firmly restrained those who would have ex
ploited the Bedell Smith story with a witch hunt
for campaign purposes . . . Certainly the re
sponsibilities of office should exert restraint on
certain Republicans whose long 'sojourn in the
wilderness' of opposition has seemed to induce
a desperate recklessness."
I
We firmly believe that the return of the
Democratic administration to power will only
continue this "recklessness." The necessary
step toward solution of the problem is a
change in administration.
And while we question Eisenhower's support
for McCarthy, we applaud the General's action
in recognizing the social implications of the
Wisconsin senator, and accepting him. We con
gratulate the Republican nominee for not
naively passing off this phenomenon — one
which represents a larger segment of the popu
lation than most intellectuals would have us
believe.—Walt Menninger
Joe McCarthy is a problem He's a problem
for Democrats and Republicans alike. He's a
problem for the country. As a problem, he de
serves some intelliqent, objective considera
tion, rather than an emotional condemnation.
We cannot avoid ihe issue of McCarthyism
nor can we simply condemn it for existinq. The
fact is it does exist! And be we professors, or
students or editorial writers, we must recoy
nize it for its social significance as well as its
ethical significance.
What about McCarthyism? It does, we
agree, reverse the practiced legal procedures
by declaring a man is guilty until proven in
nocent. But McCarthy represents more than
an individual. He represents a phenomenon
created by our times —times which have been
administered laiqely by Democrats.
Furthermore McCarthy must be recognized
as being representative of a considerable seg
ment of the population. If you think not, re
read the results in Wisconcin. This feeling is
not restricted to Wisconsin. It can be found in
any state in the union.

our opinion, undesirable.
What will happen if Eisenhower i3 elected?
A new administration, a Republican adminis
tration will be in power. McCarthy will neces
sarily tone down his attacks; and he will have
to fit his attitudes to those ol the Republican
administration.

In other words, it the Democrats are re
turned to power, there will be no controlling
of McCarthy. He remains the "equal" of any
other critic of government. If the Republicans
are elected, McCarthy will have a party su
perior—Dwight Eisenhower.
And what about Eisenhower? He has "sup
ported" McCarthy. In this matter, we question
Ike's judgment, since we feel he did make a
mistake in endorsing McCarthy. However, this
is not to be confused with "accepting" Mc-
Carthy. We would never give Joe McCarthy
our support, for we don't agree with his meth
ods; but we believe we must necessarily ac
cept him. To do otherwise is to dispute the
facts.
While we question Eisenhower's judgment,
we believe it goes without question that he is
supporting McCarthy not as an endorsement
of the Senator's actions or his opinions, but
rather because he is a member cf the same po
litical party. Ike has again and again stated
that he will not condone the actions which so
typify McCarthy.
Thus we do not believe that it will be an
"appalling and disillusioning event" if Eisen
hower is elected president. We recognize with
greater confidence the editorial words of the
non-partisan Christian Science Monitor of Oct.
9:
"He (Eisenhower) has denounced unAmeri
can methods of rooting out Communism and
firmly restrained those who would have ex
ploited the Bedell Smith story with a witch hunt
for campaign purposes . . . Certainly the re
sponsibilities of office should exert restraint on
certain Republicans whose long 'sojourn in the
wilderness' of opposition has seemed to induce
a desperate recklessness."

We firmly believe that the return of the
Democratic administration to power will only
continue this "recklessness." The necessary
step toward solution of the problem is a
change in administration.
And while we question Eisenhower's support
for McCarthy, we applaud the General's action
in recognizing the social implications of the
Wisconsin senator, and accepting him. We con
gratulate the Republican nominee for not
naively passing off this phenomenon — one
which represents a larger segment of the popu
lation than most intellectuals would have us
believe.—Walt Menninger
Joe McCarthy is a problem He's a problem
for Democrats and Republicans alike. He's a
problem for the country. As a problem, he de
serves some intelliqent, objective considera
tion, rather than an emotional condemnation.
We cannot avoid ihe issue of McCarthyism
nor can we simply condemn it for existinq. The
fact is it does exist! And be we professors, or
students or editorial writers, we must recoy
nize it for its social significance as well as its
ethical significance.
What about McCarthyism? It does, we
agree, reverse the practiced legal procedures
by declaring a man is guilty until proven in
nocent. But McCarthy represents more than
an individual. He represents a phenomenon
created by our times —times which have been
administered laiqely by Democrats.
Furthermore McCarthy must be recognized
as being representative of a considerable seg
ment of the population. If you think not, re
read the results in Wisconcin. This feeling is
not restricted to Wisconsin. It can be found in
any state in the union.
We cannot deny the existence of this feel
ing, and we must not underestimate it.
Whether we think it right or wrong, intelli
gent or stupid, good or bad, it's still there!
The job at hand is to attempt to ameliorate
this situation.
Therefore the problem resolves itself into the
question, what can we do? SinA; we are not
all voters in the state of Wisconsin, only two
alternatives are currently presented to us. We
can elect another Democratic administration
(which tends to pass olf or disregard McCarthy
ism), or a new Republican administration ( which
accepts McCarthyism).
What will happen if Stevenson is elected?
Will McCarthyism diminish? We have no in
dication whatsoever that it will. As long as the
Senator from Wisconsin is outside ths admin
istration*and his party is not culpable, he will,
v/e are sure, holler to his heart's content. As
long as there is no complete change through
out the administration, Joe and his followers
will continue their present policy. This is, in
our opinion, undesirable.
What will happen if Eisenhower i3 elected?
A new administration, a Republican adminis
tration will be in power. McCarthy will neces
sarily tone down his attacks; and he will have
