# CAMPUS OPINION
## Concerns of Ahimni 
### 
To the Editor:
Stanford alumni (ns individual citizens, of course)
have two concerns. One is that the honor of Stan
ford's name as the non-partisan, independent and
non-denominational university her founders intended
should shine clear. The other is that the intellectual
development of her Students shall, by education and
example, be free from bias and trained in discerning
and following the truth, as it was for us.
We are therefore concerned with the recent New-
Deal Political Action on campus. We are concerned
with the clumsy publicity that has broadcast error
about our college.
The statement-signers "do not claim" the name of
Stanford—they just use it. They claim their in
dividual right as citizens (who denies that?) but sign
in terms of their employment, including academic.
This New Deal semantics will be beyond the public.
In any case, the first public news that went out, over
radio and by, at least, United Press was that 150
Stanford "faculty" were endorsing Columbia and
Stevenson. The correction has not been made on
anything but n local scale—on Saturday. Mr. Wright's
letters-to-the-press are not newsworthy. New Deal
fashion, the situation was already over-ripe for con
fusion.
The Columbia statement was signed by faculty.
"Stanford," nie-tooing, elected to sign up staff also.
StatT, as a term, means faculty often to the non
aci'demic. Staff. t« the New Deal circulators, in
cluded office-secretaries (one of one week's tenure
at Stanford), cataloguers, assistants M women's
dormitories, and over seventy prisons too ne.v at
Stanford to be in any Bawloul, including the spring
supplement. Earnest alumni are finding out who
they are—or hope to.
The students' Daily rf on their only news source—-
really went woozy. It's headlines said "Faculty.'" its
text said "and staff." Friday it said only those
actually employed at Stanford were allowed to sign.
(This unnerved much staff who felt it's -ignatures

had been collected for the wastebasket.) Since the
only possible purpose of th" statement was publicity,
the faculty circulating the project might have kept
the Daily properly informed". One of the circulating
professors (in my over-hearing) dismissed the Daily
us "junior journalism." To alumni it is serious ap
prenticeship to an honorable profession.
The non-partisanship ideal in University faculty
life protects two freedoms collateral to academic
freedom, which is the right to teach the truth to the
best of ones conscience. The first is to protect the
lower faculty ranks from pressure, felt if not meant.
When a department-head signs a political statement
which is passed around his department, his statT,
conscious of future promotion, may consider ex
pedience. (Alumni are studying possible trends
here). Second, it protects students from pressure or
prejudice. A student knowing his professor's an
nounced party-line may either polish reports and
exes like apples, or miss some impartial facts in a
suspicion of bias, according to the vigor of his back
bone. (Some cadgy students might both polish and
scorn, which makes for a split mind.) Evidence of the
pressure feeling among students has appeared, this
last week.
Alumni—in Palo Alto, ungrouped—are shuffling
statistics about like mad. Either to soothe aluimii
exploding from a distance or to comfort parents.
If they speak their minds aloud, it will be in their
own words, not by re-opening a setond-hand cold
can from Columbia. ("My" English Department
surprises me. It used to demand original thinking
individually nxpfessed. I think the Honor Code
still covers students, however, on quoting.)
We will console the exploders with Saturday's Stan
ford rooting section. Its wild toss of the cards at
the Stevenson stunt was not non-partisan. (Neither
was the Boston Tea Party). It was not in the uni
versal mood of United Nations' Birthday (Neither was
the "faculty" timing.) But bleacher-alumni shook
hands on its spirit.
