# On Proposition Three
## 
### 
To the Editor:
We would like to call Proposition Three to the
attention of the voters of the Stanford campus. A
"yes" vote on this proposition confirms the action
taken by the state legislature last year in extending
the same tax exemption enjoyed by private non-profit
colleges and universities (such as Stanford) since
1014, to private non-profit schools below the college
level. These 921 schools educate 180,000 children and
save the statv of California $41.,000.000 annually, plus
a capital outlay of $350,000,000. They p.ty $750,000
u year in taxes, and in many case:; this payment

jeopardizes their very continuance.
Particularly in the face of already overcrowded
clnssrooin conditions, we cannot afford to lose the
co-operation of these schools. Besides, is it fair to
discriminate between collegiate and non-collegiate
educational institutions? Is it fair to tax a non-profit
organization, especially one which so contributes to
the general welfare?
