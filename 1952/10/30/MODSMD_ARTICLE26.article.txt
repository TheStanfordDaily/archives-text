# Here domes the Loyalty Oath Again

If at first, you don't succeed, try, try again.
And Brother Harold K. Levering is following
the old maxim to the nth degree, with assembly
proposed constitutional amendment number G.
The infamous Levering Act now comes before
the voters in proposition form.
The amendment would "require each public
officer and employee (except inferior officers
and employees exempted by law) to take an
cath that he neither advocates . . . nor is a mem
ber . . . nor has been a member during the pre
ceeding five years . . . and that he will neither
engage in such advocacy . . . nor become a
member . . . while holding office. Ad nauseam!
The same old Cal loyally oath guff.
And the proposition specifically includes
officers and employees of the University of
California and all political subdivisions and
agencies thereof.
Though we get as tired of opposing these
invidious schemes as we do of killing vipers
and vermin, it is an equally necessary duty
and one not to be taken lightly.
The law already provides for an oath to SUP
PORT the Constitution of the United States! It
is legally possible to prosecute persons for
perjuring this oath. It is not necessary to add
repetition to this oath. To do so will funda
mentally alter the conditions of government in

this country from those of a Republic toward
those of Nazi-like dictatorship.
Opposition to or support for this proposition
has nothing to do with an issue of pro- or anti-
Communism, except insofar as its shortsighted
initiators may attempt to enshroud it with an
"anti-Red ergo-good" label.
Therefore on a dual basis - lack of cause and
preservation of freedom—we urge a "NO" vote
on Proposition 6.—Jim Madison
