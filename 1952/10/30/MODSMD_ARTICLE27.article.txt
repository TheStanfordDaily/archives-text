In the published argument for proposition
number 5, a proponent attempts to divest the
proposition from any controversy about the
taking of loyalty oaths.
This argument holds little water, for adoption
of proposition 5 will prohibit the holding of pub
lic office by or tax exemptions forâ€”any person
who advocates, etc, etc, etc.
The proposition actually only provides a
loyalty oath in fact before office is held, rather
than a loyalty oath by voice while the duties
of office are being accepted.
We feel the issues and arguments are par
allel between the two propositions, and con
sequently urge a vote "NO" on Proposition 5
as well as 6. -Jim Madison
