# BULL SESSION
## 
### SAM FRESHMAN 
CiL'ESS WHO?
"There goes Sam Freshman, lie's the guy who
went ape before Zeke Wallace," will never more bo
heard on the Stanford campus. Now the truth can
be told (and it better be told in less than two
hundred and fifty words *.s the Democrats and He
publicans are taking' up all the lineage with letters
to the editor).

The picture that was heading
up this column for the last three
weeks was really not me at all
but a photograph that has been
missing from the Neanderthal
lile of natural history collection
for years. We received a very
nice letter note from the curator
upon its return, and he was kind
enough to loan us the gem which
appears alongside this week.

Then there was the Roble girl who came up to
me on Quad and said, "You must be the fellow who
writes Bull Sessions 'cause I can recognize you from
your picture."
Restraining the urge to kill (and also a few other
urges, ids, igos, and drives as she was a very at
tractive girl) 1 modestly replied, "Yes, can I give
you my autograph?"

The demure young thing was completely taken
aback ,by this but did recover enough to ask, "No.
but is it true that you eat nothing but bananas?"
Refusing to answer this obviously loaded question
1 reached for the nearest miniature tangerine tree
(that's what those things are between inner-outer
Quad and outer-inner Quad) and casually swung
out of sight.
(wait there's more, don't go away)
And now for a true story about artists, Memorial
Auditorium, arid the spicer side of life known as
Ham's Head. Ted Marcuse was really mad at the
chorus for "Murder in the Cathedral" when they
showed up a half-hour late for rehearsal, and he took
another ten minutes to tell them so.
When he v had finished, two freshmen who had
been calmly setting through the whole affair asked
if they might go. Ted, assuming they had been sent
to study lighting effects, said 110, of course not,
if they were to do the lighting they had to see the
play. Both returned meekly to their seats.
After an intensive two hour tussel with T. S.
Eliot's avant garde plot and weird stage settings,
Marcuse dismissed the cast. The two silent ones
came up on stage and asked if they might now leave.
"Of course, and be sure and explain the light
ing effects to Mr. Bruinmer, "Ted replied.
"Mr. Brummer? Who's he? This was the Gaieties
rehearsal wasn't it!"

Quad and outer-inner Quad) and casually swung
out of sight.
(wait there's more, don't go away)
And now for a true story about artists, Memorial
Auditorium, arid the spicer side of life known as
Ham's Head. Ted Marcuse was really mad at the
chorus for "Murder in the Cathedral" when they
showed up a half-hour late for rehearsal, and he took
another ten minutes to tell them so.
When he v had finished, two freshmen who had
been calmly setting through the whole affair asked
if they might go. Ted, assuming they had been sent
to study lighting effects, said 110, of course not,
if they were to do the lighting they had to see the
play. Both returned meekly to their seats.
After an intensive two hour tussel with T. S.
Eliot's avant garde plot and weird stage settings,
Marcuse dismissed the cast. The two silent ones
came up on stage and asked if they might now leave.
"Of course, and be sure and explain the light
ing effects to Mr. Bruinmer, "Ted replied.
"Mr. Brummer? Who's he? This was the Gaieties
rehearsal wasn't it!"

CiL'ESS WHO?
"There goes Sam Freshman, lie's the guy who
went ape before Zeke Wallace," will never more bo
heard on the Stanford campus. Now the truth can
be told (and it better be told in less than two
hundred and fifty words *.s the Democrats and He
publicans are taking' up all the lineage with letters
to the editor).

The picture that was heading
up this column for the last three
weeks was really not me at all
but a photograph that has been
missing from the Neanderthal
lile of natural history collection
for years. We received a very
nice letter note from the curator
upon its return, and he was kind
enough to loan us the gem which
appears alongside this week.

Then there was the Roble girl who came up to
me on Quad and said, "You must be the fellow who
writes Bull Sessions 'cause I can recognize you from
your picture."
Restraining the urge to kill (and also a few other
urges, ids, igos, and drives as she was a very at
tractive girl) 1 modestly replied, "Yes, can I give
you my autograph?"

The demure young thing was completely taken
aback ,by this but did recover enough to ask, "No.
but is it true that you eat nothing but bananas?"
