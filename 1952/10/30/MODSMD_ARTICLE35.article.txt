Chuck Taylor had the "closed
practice" sign up once more at loot
hall practice yesterday.
This time the red-haired mentor
sent his charges through another
rugged and spirited scrimmage, with
the frosh eleven doiny the chore of
imitating the San Jose State de
fensive team.
Skip Crist broke loo.se lor several
nice gains for the varsity, as did
Chuck Brazel. Another feature of
the long scrum, which lasted late
into the evening under the lights,
was the passing of Boh Garrett. The
quarterback tossed for 'several
touchdowns, including one to Bob
Mathias and another to Brazel.
No injuries were suffered, some
more good news.
As to the defensive work, con
siderable time and thought were
given to halting Lynn Aplanalp, the
Spartans' chief offensive threat.
Lynn operates at quarterback for
San Jose, and Taylor last Monday
had this to say about the nation's
top offensive backs:
"Aplanalp is not as good a run
ner cis Paul Cameron oi UCLA but
Lynn is a better passer. And Ap
lanalp is as good a passer as Wash
ington's Don lleinrich and a better

runner than Don."
Cameron stunned the Indians
with his running game at Los An
geles, while Heinrich tossed the ball
around lor 253 yards in last Sat
urday's Husky-Card contest, so Ap
lanalp is moving in pretty good
company. < - ,
