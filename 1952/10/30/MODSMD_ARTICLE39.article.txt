# Stern 4, Theta Delts Win in Murals
## 
### WES MARX 
One undefeated team continued to
roll while another met its downfall
in intramural footbai) play yester
i 'lay.
Alpha Sig easily passed up Steri
, 4, 27-0. to post their fourth strak'hl
victory, but Theta Xi was stopped
, cold at three victories as Thctf
Delt II beat them in a playoff.
The Theta letter societies' meet-
I was a weird contest. The issuf
: was almost decided in Theta Xi'?
favor in the first half. Theta Xi'.>
Tom Jellett completed a touchdown
pass to Jack Young but the play was
nullified on a penalty. On the next
play Young yot cleat'* in the enr !
zone again, but Jellett's pa«s let!
Young to catch the p.uss off tht
ground and land out-of-bounds, in
a play resembling Stanford end
John Steinberg's all - for - naught
catches in last Saturday's contest
with Washington. After these close
calls Theta Delt's defense proved
score-proof.
Meanwhile Theta Delt, loser of
their previous three contests, could
get nowhere on offense. Regulation
time ran out on the deadlocked
teams. Mural rules provide in such
' tied-up games that the team gain
ing the most yardage in one set of
downs takes home the victory. On
the first set of downs both teams
moved 15 yards. Enter another set
of downs, and this time Theta Xi
could not beat Theta Delt's 20 yards
gained.
In a more easily understood game,
Alpha Sig's offense pounded Stern
4's defense for lour touchdowns and
their defense controlled Stern's
scoring tries. Alpha Sig's Bill Gon
ser hit Bob Pickett lor two scores,
while teammate Chuck Bell got a
TD pass to Ken Lewis. Lewis and
Pickett teamed up to provide an
other score when Lewis blocked a
Stern punt in the end zone with
Pickett recovering it.
The Frosh Medics beat Stern 1,
29-0, and DU provided another
shutout contest as they took an 1H-0
victory from Biz II.

a play resembling Stanford end
John Steinberg's all - for - naught
catches in last Saturday's contest
with Washington. After these close
calls Theta Delt's defense proved
score-proof.
Meanwhile Theta Delt, loser of
their previous three contests, could
get nowhere on offense. Regulation
time ran out on the deadlocked
teams. Mural rules provide in such
' tied-up games that the team gain
ing the most yardage in one set of
downs takes home the victory. On
the first set of downs both teams
moved 15 yards. Enter another set
of downs, and this time Theta Xi
could not beat Theta Delt's 20 yards
gained.
In a more easily understood game,
Alpha Sig's offense pounded Stern
4's defense for lour touchdowns and
their defense controlled Stern's
scoring tries. Alpha Sig's Bill Gon
ser hit Bob Pickett lor two scores,
while teammate Chuck Bell got a
TD pass to Ken Lewis. Lewis and
Pickett teamed up to provide an
other score when Lewis blocked a
Stern punt in the end zone with
Pickett recovering it.
The Frosh Medics beat Stern 1,
29-0, and DU provided another
shutout contest as they took an 1H-0
victory from Biz II.
