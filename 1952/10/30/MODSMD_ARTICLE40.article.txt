# BRAVES' OPENER
## JV's Prepare For Saturday 
### 
Coach Mai Elward has been put
ting his Stanford Brave footballers
through the paces this week, in
preparation for their first game of
the season Saturday morning,
j The Braves open their three-game
i slate against the Treasure Island
j Navy in an 11 o'clock preliminary to
j the Stanford-San Jose State varsity
tilt,
i Elward's crew has been running
- j plays oH the T-formation this week,
j prepping the varsity for Saturday's
1 Spartan invasion, and will employ
J the formation against the Islanders.
: Stan Dawson, 175-pound starting
; left halfback, is expected to carry
the brunt of the JV's offensive
punch. Dawson is the fastest runner
on the squad and packs enough
punch to be equally effective driv
ing through the middle or skirting
the outside.
I The Braves have a pair of hard
runners in fullback Don Day and
: right half Mike Anderson to
; strengthen their running attack.
; Day weighs in at 200 pounds with
j Anderson tipping the scales at 195.
Anderson will handle most of the
kicking assignments Saturday.
In the passing department, quar
j terback Pete Reynolds will be on
the throwing end. The JV's aerial
game is noticeably lacking in good
; receivers.
Jack Schwartz, the Braves' best
receiver, has been playing with the
varsity, but may return to see ac
tion against tiie Navy. Schwartz's
return to his old right end spot
should add potency to Stanford's
| air attack. Left end Marty Trieb
I has caught Elward's eye as a good
1 blocker, but lacks Schwartz's pass
! catching ability.
! Little is known about Braves' de-
J fensive capabilities, since they have
been- limited strictly to offense
1 against the varsity since practice
