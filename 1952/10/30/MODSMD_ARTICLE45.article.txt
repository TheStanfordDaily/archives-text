far beyond their meager ability, are
still holding a comfortable but nar
rowing lead, .713 to .700.

With a burst here and there and
a hearty moan from all concerned,
the fifth week of rugged competi
tion between the terrible trouba
dours of the typewriters (alias Daily
sportsmen) and Chuck Taylor and
his mighty mites, A 1 Kirkland and
Jim Vick, gets under way.
As we come around the far turn,
the Dippy dynamos, showing form
far beyond their meager ability, are
still holding a comfortable but nar
rowing lead, .713 to .700.
Outstanding come - through per
formance of the week goes to Kirk
land. His spectacular 9-1 record for
the week (ties count as wins) Is the
best individual performance of the
season to date, and throws him into
first place individually with .775.
