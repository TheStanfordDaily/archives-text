## 
### JIM MADISON Associate Editor The Daily 
"To move on" was the theme
of last night's Excom meeting, as
ASSU President Dick Weismann
led the committee members
through a maze of routine busi
ness.
Heading the list was a report by
Jean Leonard which proposed the
form in which the Liquor Resolu
tion will be placed on 11»it. quarter's
ballot.
As proposed by the committee
and amended by Excoin, the meas
ure now will read on the ballot:
"We, the students of Stanford
University, resolve that the State
of California set the minimum
legal age for purchasing beers,
ales, and wines containing less
than I.'! per cent alcohol b_v vol
ume, as IS years, and provide
persons between the ages of IS
and 21 years with non-transfer
able personal identification.
"I. Do you (the voter) approve
of this idea?
"2. Do you approve of submit
ting this question to the State
Legislature?"
The original committee report did
not indue the phrase "We the stu
dents," and Toni Tribblc raised the
issue of whether or not the name of
Stanford should be associated with
the move.
An amendment by Fran Kirk, Vil
lage representative, to add a third
question, "Do you favor the name
of Stanford being attached to the
resolution when submitted?" was
defeated by a margin of 6 to 5; and
the phrase about the students was
inserted to clarify Miss Tribble's
issue.
Dates for this quarter's elections
were then set: primary, Nov. 10;
final, Nov. 14. The election was
postponed from the original dates
of Nov. 5 and 12 to avoid conflict
with the national election.
Excom did hear a brief outline
of the proposed amendment, in
which Frazer explained that it
would reverse the election dates of
class and living group representa
tives. At present, living group rep
resentatives are clcctcd in the
spring elections and class represen
tatives in the fall.
Steve Horn, student manager, re
ported that the substructure of the
Lake Lag boathousc had been com
pletely rebuilt at 1 a budgeted ex
pense of $.'5,400.
Horn also asked for and was
granted an appropriation of .$2OO
from the ASSU reserve for mainte
nance fund to install improved
lighting in the Excom room.

An amendment by Fran Kirk, Vil
lage representative, to add a third
question, "Do you favor the name
of Stanford being attached to the
resolution when submitted?" was
defeated by a margin of 6 to 5; and
the phrase about the students was
inserted to clarify Miss Tribble's
issue.

were then set: primary, Nov. 10;
final, Nov. 14. The election was
postponed from the original dates
