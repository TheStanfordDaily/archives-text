# Card Gridders Seek Scalps Of High-Scoring Spartans
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
Round Iwo of the championship of the Santa Clara Valley will
he up for decision in Stanford Stadium tomorrow afternoon when
the Indians meet the San Jose State Spartans at 2 o'clock. The
Cards are already one up for this mythical regional title, having
whipped Santa Clara in their season's opener.
For a school that is advocating a "football-for-fun" policy this

fall, 1 lie San Joseans will present an
impressive record. They have won
four out of five games and rank high
in the NCAA statistics.
According to the latest releases,
the Spartans arc second in total of
fen.'C with an average of 455.8 yards
per game, and second in rushing oi
fensc with a 301.2 per game aver
age.
Chiefly responsible for (his im
posing rating are a pair of back
fioM men, quarterback Lynn Ap
lanalp and fullback Hick Stults.
Aplanalp. whom Stanford Coach
Chuck Taylor rates "as good a
passer as Don Hcinrich," was only
a run-of-the-mill performer last
season. Bui this year, the Los An
geles senior has a firm hold on
seventh spot in total offense in
(he nation.
Stults, who also was just another
fullback last fall, has blossomed in
1952, and helps to give Bronzan's
eleven a diversified attack. In the
Colorado contest, for instance, I he
108-pound senior ground out 171 net
yards and was acclaimed as the fin
e/-t tullback ever lo appear at Boul
der.
Oddly enough, it was in the
Colorado game that (lie Spartans
were supposed to have played
their game this year, but the
Buffs nipped San Jose 20 to 14.
In their four wins, San Jose has
romped over San Diego State 47-11
and Fresno State to the tune of
40-(i. Slightly less decisive tri
umphs were scored over Arizona
State at Tempe 21 to 14, and Col
lege of Pacific 26-21.
In their preparations for the
Cards, San Jose took the week oIT
last Saturday, so they are well rest
ed for this contest.
Besides Aplanalp and Stults,
there are several other talented
members of the Spartan cast.
Two seniors, Bob Amaral, a con
verted fullback, and Steve Wacholz
(6 ft. 3 l 2 in.), serve as a shifty pair
of ends on offense . Both are good
targets for Aplanalp's passes.
Other standouts in the line in
clude a hefty pair of tackles in
George Porter and Sal Cardinalli,
and guard Clarence Orr.
Porter and Cardinalli combine to
add 455 pounds of beef to the offen
sive platoon, while Orr is consid
ered to be the best blocker on
the Spartan eleven. A rugged de
fensive tackle" is Jon Peterson, a
247-nound heavyweight.
Helping out Aplanalp and Stults
in tiie backficld are the Matthews
brothers, Aland Larry. A 1 is a
converted end, while Larry, al
though only 147 pounds, is a con
stant breakaway threat with an
over-10 - y a r ils - per - carry average.
Also slated for plenty of action
are Roy Iliram and Bob Osborne.
Although San Jose has never
whipped the Indians in nine tries

over the years, Card Coach Chuck
Taylor has been drilling his charges
very hard the past week. For the
first time since he took over the
football reins at the Farm, Taylor
scheduled "secrct practices." Even
newsmen were barred from the
workouts.
Taylor guve as Ids reason that
he contemplated some personnel
changes after two straight defeats.
Just what these changes, if any,
are, Taylor wouldn't disclose, but
he promised that his boys would
be up for the Spartans this week,
something they haven't been for
San Jose the past two years.
Chief emphasis in the scrimmages
this week has been on controlling
fumbles. "Fnmbleitis" hurt the In
dians in both the UCLA and Wash
ington games, setting up several op
position scores.
Taylor hasn't neglected the of
fense. however, and spent consid
erable time working on pass pro
tection for Bob Garrett. With
both Bob and Aplanalp tossing the
ball around, prospects are for a
h'i'fh-scoring game.
In their attempt to make it ten in
a row over their Valley neighbors,
only two Cards are definitely out of
tomorrow's game. Defensive end
Ron Eadie still has a bad knee arid
won't be ready until the USC game,
while linebacker Chuck Essegian, of
course, is out for the year. Either
Ron Bush or Bob Hoegh will re
place Eadie, while Marsh Howe is
scheduled to take over Essegian's
spot.
In an 11 o'clock preliminary to
morrow, the Stanford Braves will
open their season against the Treas
ure Island Navy eleven, champions
of the Twelfth Naval District.

108-pound senior ground out 171 net
yards and was acclaimed as the fin
e/-t tullback ever lo appear at Boul
der.
Oddly enough, it was in the
Colorado game that (lie Spartans
were supposed to have played
their game this year, but the
Buffs nipped San Jose 20 to 14.
In their four wins, San Jose has
romped over San Diego State 47-11
and Fresno State to the tune of
40-(i. Slightly less decisive tri
umphs were scored over Arizona
State at Tempe 21 to 14, and Col
lege of Pacific 26-21.
In their preparations for the
Cards, San Jose took the week oIT
last Saturday, so they are well rest
ed for this contest.
Besides Aplanalp and Stults,
there are several other talented
members of the Spartan cast.
Two seniors, Bob Amaral, a con
verted fullback, and Steve Wacholz
(6 ft. 3 l 2 in.), serve as a shifty pair
of ends on offense . Both are good
targets for Aplanalp's passes.
Other standouts in the line in
clude a hefty pair of tackles in
George Porter and Sal Cardinalli,
and guard Clarence Orr.
Porter and Cardinalli combine to
add 455 pounds of beef to the offen
sive platoon, while Orr is consid
ered to be the best blocker on
the Spartan eleven. A rugged de
fensive tackle" is Jon Peterson, a
247-nound heavyweight.
Helping out Aplanalp and Stults
in tiie backficld are the Matthews
brothers, Aland Larry. A 1 is a
converted end, while Larry, al
though only 147 pounds, is a con
stant breakaway threat with an
over-10 - y a r ils - per - carry average.
Also slated for plenty of action
are Roy Iliram and Bob Osborne.
Although San Jose has never
whipped the Indians in nine tries

over the years, Card Coach Chuck
Taylor has been drilling his charges
very hard the past week. For the
first time since he took over the
football reins at the Farm, Taylor
scheduled "secrct practices." Even
newsmen were barred from the
workouts.
Taylor guve as Ids reason that
he contemplated some personnel
changes after two straight defeats.
Just what these changes, if any,
are, Taylor wouldn't disclose, but
he promised that his boys would
be up for the Spartans this week,
something they haven't been for
San Jose the past two years.
Chief emphasis in the scrimmages
this week has been on controlling
fumbles. "Fnmbleitis" hurt the In
dians in both the UCLA and Wash
ington games, setting up several op
position scores.
Taylor hasn't neglected the of
fense. however, and spent consid
erable time working on pass pro
tection for Bob Garrett. With
both Bob and Aplanalp tossing the
ball around, prospects are for a
h'i'fh-scoring game.
In their attempt to make it ten in
a row over their Valley neighbors,
only two Cards are definitely out of
tomorrow's game. Defensive end
Ron Eadie still has a bad knee arid
won't be ready until the USC game,
while linebacker Chuck Essegian, of
course, is out for the year. Either
Ron Bush or Bob Hoegh will re
place Eadie, while Marsh Howe is
scheduled to take over Essegian's
spot.
In an 11 o'clock preliminary to
morrow, the Stanford Braves will
open their season against the Treas
ure Island Navy eleven, champions
of the Twelfth Naval District.
Round Iwo of the championship of the Santa Clara Valley will
he up for decision in Stanford Stadium tomorrow afternoon when
the Indians meet the San Jose State Spartans at 2 o'clock. The
Cards are already one up for this mythical regional title, having
whipped Santa Clara in their season's opener.
For a school that is advocating a "football-for-fun" policy this

fall, 1 lie San Joseans will present an
impressive record. They have won
four out of five games and rank high
in the NCAA statistics.
According to the latest releases,
the Spartans arc second in total of
fen.'C with an average of 455.8 yards
per game, and second in rushing oi
fensc with a 301.2 per game aver
age.
Chiefly responsible for (his im
posing rating are a pair of back
fioM men, quarterback Lynn Ap
lanalp and fullback Hick Stults.
Aplanalp. whom Stanford Coach
Chuck Taylor rates "as good a
passer as Don Hcinrich," was only
a run-of-the-mill performer last
season. Bui this year, the Los An
geles senior has a firm hold on
seventh spot in total offense in
(he nation.
Stults, who also was just another
fullback last fall, has blossomed in
1952, and helps to give Bronzan's
eleven a diversified attack. In the
Colorado contest, for instance, I he
108-pound senior ground out 171 net

ered to be the best blocker on
the Spartan eleven. A rugged de
fensive tackle" is Jon Peterson, a
247-nound heavyweight.
Helping out Aplanalp and Stults
in tiie backficld are the Matthews
brothers, Aland Larry. A 1 is a
converted end, while Larry, al
though only 147 pounds, is a con
stant breakaway threat with an
over-10 - y a r ils - per - carry average.
Also slated for plenty of action
are Roy Iliram and Bob Osborne.
Although San Jose has never
whipped the Indians in nine tries

over the years, Card Coach Chuck
Taylor has been drilling his charges
very hard the past week. For the
first time since he took over the
football reins at the Farm, Taylor
scheduled "secrct practices." Even
newsmen were barred from the
workouts.
Taylor guve as Ids reason that
he contemplated some personnel
changes after two straight defeats.
Just what these changes, if any,
are, Taylor wouldn't disclose, but
he promised that his boys would
be up for the Spartans this week,
something they haven't been for
San Jose the past two years.
Chief emphasis in the scrimmages
this week has been on controlling
fumbles. "Fnmbleitis" hurt the In
dians in both the UCLA and Wash
ington games, setting up several op
position scores.
Taylor hasn't neglected the of
fense. however, and spent consid
erable time working on pass pro
tection for Bob Garrett. With
both Bob and Aplanalp tossing the
ball around, prospects are for a
h'i'fh-scoring game.
In their attempt to make it ten in
a row over their Valley neighbors,
only two Cards are definitely out of
tomorrow's game. Defensive end
Ron Eadie still has a bad knee arid
won't be ready until the USC game,
while linebacker Chuck Essegian, of
course, is out for the year. Either
Ron Bush or Bob Hoegh will re
place Eadie, while Marsh Howe is
scheduled to take over Essegian's
spot.
In an 11 o'clock preliminary to
morrow, the Stanford Braves will
open their season against the Treas
ure Island Navy eleven, champions
of the Twelfth Naval District.
Round Iwo of the championship of the Santa Clara Valley will
he up for decision in Stanford Stadium tomorrow afternoon when
the Indians meet the San Jose State Spartans at 2 o'clock. The
Cards are already one up for this mythical regional title, having
whipped Santa Clara in their season's opener.
For a school that is advocating a "football-for-fun" policy this

fall, 1 lie San Joseans will present an
impressive record. They have won
four out of five games and rank high
in the NCAA statistics.
According to the latest releases,
the Spartans arc second in total of
fen.'C with an average of 455.8 yards
per game, and second in rushing oi
fensc with a 301.2 per game aver
age.
Chiefly responsible for (his im
posing rating are a pair of back
fioM men, quarterback Lynn Ap
lanalp and fullback Hick Stults.
Aplanalp. whom Stanford Coach
Chuck Taylor rates "as good a
passer as Don Hcinrich," was only
a run-of-the-mill performer last
season. Bui this year, the Los An
geles senior has a firm hold on
seventh spot in total offense in
(he nation.
Stults, who also was just another
fullback last fall, has blossomed in
1952, and helps to give Bronzan's
eleven a diversified attack. In the
Colorado contest, for instance, I he
108-pound senior ground out 171 net
yards and was acclaimed as the fin
e/-t tullback ever lo appear at Boul
der.

Oddly enough, it was in the
Colorado game that (lie Spartans
were supposed to have played
their game this year, but the
Buffs nipped San Jose 20 to 14.
In their four wins, San Jose has
romped over San Diego State 47-11
and Fresno State to the tune of
40-(i. Slightly less decisive tri
umphs were scored over Arizona
State at Tempe 21 to 14, and Col
lege of Pacific 26-21.
In their preparations for the
Cards, San Jose took the week oIT
last Saturday, so they are well rest
ed for this contest.
Besides Aplanalp and Stults,
there are several other talented
members of the Spartan cast.
Two seniors, Bob Amaral, a con
verted fullback, and Steve Wacholz
(6 ft. 3 l 2 in.), serve as a shifty pair
of ends on offense . Both are good
targets for Aplanalp's passes.
Other standouts in the line in

George Porter and Sal Cardinalli,
and guard Clarence Orr.
