TEMPTATION—Thomas a Becket, played by Clayton Garrison
on the right, is tempted by an old friend who reminds him of
his easy, worthless, pleasure loving youth. The Stanford Players
present "Murder in the Cathedral," T. S. Eliot's verse drama, for
the third time tonight at 8:15 in the Little Theatre.
