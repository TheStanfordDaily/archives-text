# A 						Realistic Viewpoint

### 
The political situation has changed even from
last Friday when the Stanford group endorse-
rnent of the Columbia petition was published,
}>uf we would like to make a few final com-
summing up our impressions cf the
whole' affair.
fii 'The petition signers must have realised
they were signing a document which made
the whole presidential issue a contrast in
black- (Eisenhower) and white (Stevenson),
whitOfy it most certainly is not. It is rather a
series of grays, and your interpretation of the
lighter or darker gray depends upon your
, .... ,
f'he petitioners stated: He (Eisenhower) has
r ~ , , , ,
been wronq. —and they cited foreiqn policy,
„ »„ ~
civil rights, Taft, McCarthy, etc. We too would
, ' . „
admit that we do not appreciate some of Eisen-
, ~ „
hower s actions, but to say that he is wrong
, Tail
is to assume for ourselves just a little more
1; a
divinity than we feel anyone has a right to
£ .„ ume
UTo explain further the white black contrast
attempt, we would again cite the petition. "He
(Stevenson) disdains to fraternize with those
who use the smear for cheap political advan-
tage." What about Harry?
V/e find it impossible to sit down and real-
isticaly paint a black and white picture of the
situation. That can only be derived by an
Realistic interpretation. And idealism vs.
TTalism is perhaps a parallel of the Steven-
jtcn vs. Eisenhower w 1 ancjle.
''Take civil rights. Both candidates do agree
on the basic principles and although the pe-
tition was not specific, we assume the signer.l
back the Democratic party's plank for immedi-

ate compulsory federal FEPC.
And hew are they planning to enlorce it?
You can progress no further than the society
currently desires to progress—Prohibition 011
a national scale proved that pretty effectively.
And yet the intellectuals, and Adlai Steven
son, would have us do the same with civil
rights.
Y/ e consider ourselves rather fervent realists
w j lo a pp rec j d { e idealism as our goal, but not to
p U j p rac tj ce w hen it is impractical. This is
vvhy we support Eisenhower on civil rights.
Similarly wUh Kor ea, or Taft, or McCarthy.
Eisenhower is sacrificing all his ideals—so goes

attitude—and not an insincere attitude merely

to gain votes.
"1 shall qo to Korea ' in our estimation is

Communism; he recognizes that the country
is not all a group of collegiate intellectuals; and
he is compromising his methods to fit the needs
of the country. I hat this interpretation may not

political science is not significant. What is sig
nificant is how that interpretation jibes with
