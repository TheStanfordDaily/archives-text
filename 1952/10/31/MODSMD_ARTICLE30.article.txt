# Yes on 3, No on 2

In California, a political debate concerning
schools seems to stir up a hotter pot of boiling
water than any other subject. For one reason,
Culifornians pay more attention to caring for
their school system than practically any other
state in tho country. The large amount of money
tied up in this school management, however,
has focused the keen and howling eyes of self
siyled "slash the budget" economists on any
proposal concerning funds for schools.
All in all, the current Propositions 2 and 3
have caused a merry ruckus.
Proposition 2 would write into the State Con-
stitution increased state budgetary support for
the schools. While state contributions are now
scaled at Not less than $120 per year ADA (aver-
age daily attendance), they would be increased
lo not less than $180 per year ADA.
The idea behind this proposition is sound.
Additional funds would be made available to
the local school districts from the state treasury,
which has a broader tar: base than the local
communities.
There is inherent in adoption of the proposi-
+ion, however, one principle which we consider
most unsound practice for any governmental
agency to be forced into.
That is, writing the budget into the con-
stitution. Already over 40 percent of the
State General Fund is frozen for constitution-
ally fixed cost. The sum is already too much.
—To add mote would be cairyinq a dangerous
practice ever nearer to calamity fci the state.
Wt would have favored a change in the legis-
lative statutes raising the state support for the
schools. As it is, we are forced by good judg-
ment, not lack of concern for the Calilornia pub-
lie school system, to urge a "NO" vote on Prop-
osition Number 2.
There seems to be an even more vociferous
argument over Proposition 3. Here again dis-
putants raise a question of governmental philos-

ophy that is superior to any argument over
economics.
The question is: should schools of less than
collegiate grade, owned and operated by non
profit religious, hospital, or charitable institu
tions, be encouraged to operate separate and
apart from the state school system?
We feel they should, because we feel that
any man has a legitimate right to have his
children educated in the way he feels most ad
vantageous. If this means in a private school,
that's OK. He should still pay his personal prop
erty taxes, but the school property itself should
not be taxed for its existence. «
This necessarily implies a body to supervise
quality standards for private schools. The pri
vate non-religious schools already have such
an accrediting association. Perhaps one should
be incorporated for the religious schools. But
that is a question apart from consideration of
Proposition 3.
There is no room for an argument saying:
"Proposition 3 would give a blanket, wide-open
door exemption to any type of private school."
Ample definition and restriction is provided in
the ltvv to make certain no fake or profit-oper
ated schools would gain the exemption.
Hard boiled figures add even more fuel to
the fire supporting 3. Statisticians estimate that
operation of the non-profit private schools save
the state taxpayers $41,000,000 a year in annual
expenses, because the overcrowded state
schools are relieved of the burden of over 180,-
000 pupils who attend private schools. Contrast
this with less than $000,000 in taxes which
would be lost if private non-profit schools are
granted a tax exemption as provided under
Proposition 3.
Therefore, after due consideration of a wide
range of arguments, we urge a "YES" vote on
Proposition 3, as well as a "NO" vote on No. 2.
