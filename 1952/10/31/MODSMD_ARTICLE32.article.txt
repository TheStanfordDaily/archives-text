# Propositions Pose Weighty Questions
## 
### HADLEY ROFF 
California voters have several
momentous decisions to make
Tuesday when they march to the
polls.
Should they vote the repeal oi
crossfiling? Should they okay
the establishment of a stiff new
loyalty program? Should they
provide lor a state managed wel
fare program?
These are but a few of the im
portant measures embodied in the
set of 24 proposed amendments to
the California constitution on the
ballot this year.
Of the 24 proposed ballot meas
ures, five stand out as crucial. These
are Proposition Five, outlining an
intensive loyalty program; Proposi
tion Six, requiring all public em
ployes to take a loyalty oath; Prop
osition Seven, calling for candidates
under cross filing to designate party
affiiliations on the ballot; Proposition
11, outlining a state welfare pro
gram; and Proposition 13, calling for
the prohibition of cross filing, *
These five could mean tremen
dous change in state administrative
procedures if passed.
Take Proposition 11, the scheme
for state control of all welfare
work. The measure is being
pushed by the Institute of Social
Welfare, headed by pension plan
ner George IWcLain of Los Angeles.
The proposal would eliminate
local welfare agencies, and focus
administration of the vast welfare
funds in the hands of a state bureau.
McLain and his supporters
claim this will mean less duplica
tion of welfare efforts and thus a
saving in tax money. Opponents
say the measure, as conceived by
McLain, would mean a $100 mil
lion increase in welfare expendi
tures.
Aside from providing for complete
state management, McLain's meas
ure also calls for a sliding scale of
pension payments, from $75 to $100
a month depending on the cost of liv
ing. Also medical payments and
burial expenses are provided for.
Another bitterly contested pro
posal is Proposition Five which
calls for the establishment of a
state loyalty program.
The measure bars from public
oflicc those individuals who "ad
vocate the overthrow of the gov
ernment of the United Stales or
of the State of California by force
or violence or other unlawful
means."
The proponents of the measure
point out that "a few Communists in

key civilian defense or other gov
ernmental spots can cause untold
damage" and claim that the proposi
tion will keep state government free
of Red infiltration.
Opponents say the proposition
is framed in ambiguities. They
point out that under the MeCarran
Act the word "advocates" means
"speaking in favor of, giving sup
port to, admitting to belief in."
But, they ask, "What is speaking
in favor of" mean. Could a simple
discussion of Communist philos
ophy be construed to mean "advo
cate'' by government agents'.'"
they continue.
They further point out that to en
force such a measure a police net
work would have to be establish at
considerable cost to the taxpayer.
. Tied closely with Proposition Five
is Proposition Six, which makes the
much argued Loyalty Oath part of
the State Constitution. The proposi
tion widens the sweep of the Oath
to include all public employees, even
to the county and city levels.
Those campaigning for the meas
ure insist that the Oath would
make if possible "to keep Com
munists out of public jobs—for an
oath violator becomes subject to
trial for perjury, facing fine or
imprisonment."
But those opposing the proposition,
speaking out in the handbook pre
pared for voters by Secretary of
State Frank Jordan, say. "This pro
posal is a serious threat to |our|
democratic freedoms. Its passage
would be a mandate to the Legis
lature to establish an authority to
investigate and snoop into the lives
of all the people, even on irrelevant
matters."
Cross filing, ail old lnig-a-boo
of political debate in this state, is
another of the crucial issues.
There are two propositions that
deal with the cross filing systems,
Seven which provides that candi
dates must designate their party
affiliations 011 the primary ballot,
and i:i which calls for abolition of
the system.
Seven, by placing the party affili
ation of the candidate on the ballot,
will reduce one of the charged
abuses of the cross filing system.
Cross filing, most partisan or
ganizations in the state say, tends
to create confusion in the voters'
mind. But, say proponents of
seven, this confusion can be elimi
nated by making clear the party
sympathy of the candidate.
Many in the state feel that com
plete abolition of the system is de
sirable. Those favoring 13 declare
"the primary, should allow the
voters of each party to nominate

its candidates and decide its internal
questions of leadership and policy."
This cannot be done, they conclude,
under cross filing.
But opponents to the- measure,
also speaking in the Commonwealth,
counter, "Proposition 13—a radical
change in California's election laws
—this is a denial of the right to vote
according to individual conviction
and judgment in a primary election.
It has been the right and privilege
of the California electorate to vote
for the man best suited for the job,
regardless of political party affilia
tion, for 39 years."

the California constitution on the
ballot this year.
Of the 24 proposed ballot meas
ures, five stand out as crucial. These
are Proposition Five, outlining an
intensive loyalty program; Proposi
tion Six, requiring all public em
ployes to take a loyalty oath; Prop
osition Seven, calling for candidates
under cross filing to designate party
affiiliations on the ballot; Proposition
11, outlining a state welfare pro
gram; and Proposition 13, calling for
the prohibition of cross filing, *
These five could mean tremen
dous change in state administrative
procedures if passed.
Take Proposition 11, the scheme
for state control of all welfare
work. The measure is being
pushed by the Institute of Social
Welfare, headed by pension plan
ner George IWcLain of Los Angeles.
The proposal would eliminate
local welfare agencies, and focus
administration of the vast welfare
funds in the hands of a state bureau.
McLain and his supporters
claim this will mean less duplica
tion of welfare efforts and thus a
saving in tax money. Opponents
say the measure, as conceived by
McLain, would mean a $100 mil
lion increase in welfare expendi
tures.
Aside from providing for complete
state management, McLain's meas
ure also calls for a sliding scale of
pension payments, from $75 to $100
a month depending on the cost of liv
ing. Also medical payments and
burial expenses are provided for.
Another bitterly contested pro
posal is Proposition Five which
calls for the establishment of a
state loyalty program.
The measure bars from public
oflicc those individuals who "ad
vocate the overthrow of the gov
ernment of the United Stales or
of the State of California by force
or violence or other unlawful
means."
The proponents of the measure
point out that "a few Communists in

key civilian defense or other gov
ernmental spots can cause untold
damage" and claim that the proposi
tion will keep state government free
of Red infiltration.
Opponents say the proposition
is framed in ambiguities. They
point out that under the MeCarran
Act the word "advocates" means
"speaking in favor of, giving sup
port to, admitting to belief in."
But, they ask, "What is speaking
in favor of" mean. Could a simple
discussion of Communist philos
ophy be construed to mean "advo
cate'' by government agents'.'"
they continue.
They further point out that to en
force such a measure a police net
work would have to be establish at
considerable cost to the taxpayer.
. Tied closely with Proposition Five
is Proposition Six, which makes the
much argued Loyalty Oath part of
the State Constitution. The proposi
tion widens the sweep of the Oath
to include all public employees, even
to the county and city levels.
Those campaigning for the meas
ure insist that the Oath would
make if possible "to keep Com
munists out of public jobs—for an
oath violator becomes subject to
trial for perjury, facing fine or
imprisonment."
But those opposing the proposition,
speaking out in the handbook pre
pared for voters by Secretary of
State Frank Jordan, say. "This pro
posal is a serious threat to |our|
democratic freedoms. Its passage
would be a mandate to the Legis
lature to establish an authority to
investigate and snoop into the lives
of all the people, even on irrelevant
matters."
Cross filing, ail old lnig-a-boo
of political debate in this state, is
another of the crucial issues.
There are two propositions that
deal with the cross filing systems,
Seven which provides that candi
dates must designate their party
affiliations 011 the primary ballot,
and i:i which calls for abolition of
the system.
Seven, by placing the party affili
ation of the candidate on the ballot,
will reduce one of the charged
abuses of the cross filing system.
Cross filing, most partisan or
ganizations in the state say, tends
to create confusion in the voters'
mind. But, say proponents of
seven, this confusion can be elimi
nated by making clear the party
sympathy of the candidate.
Many in the state feel that com
plete abolition of the system is de
sirable. Those favoring 13 declare
"the primary, should allow the
voters of each party to nominate

its candidates and decide its internal
questions of leadership and policy."
This cannot be done, they conclude,
under cross filing.
But opponents to the- measure,
also speaking in the Commonwealth,
counter, "Proposition 13—a radical
change in California's election laws
—this is a denial of the right to vote
according to individual conviction
and judgment in a primary election.
It has been the right and privilege
of the California electorate to vote
for the man best suited for the job,
regardless of political party affilia
tion, for 39 years."
California voters have several
momentous decisions to make
Tuesday when they march to the
polls.
Should they vote the repeal oi
crossfiling? Should they okay
the establishment of a stiff new
loyalty program? Should they
provide lor a state managed wel
fare program?

11, outlining a state welfare pro
gram; and Proposition 13, calling for
the prohibition of cross filing, *
These five could mean tremen
dous change in state administrative
procedures if passed.
Take Proposition 11, the scheme
for state control of all welfare
work. The measure is being
pushed by the Institute of Social
Welfare, headed by pension plan
ner George IWcLain of Los Angeles.
The proposal would eliminate
local welfare agencies, and focus
administration of the vast welfare
funds in the hands of a state bureau.
McLain and his supporters
claim this will mean less duplica
tion of welfare efforts and thus a
saving in tax money. Opponents
say the measure, as conceived by
McLain, would mean a $100 mil
lion increase in welfare expendi
tures.
Aside from providing for complete
state management, McLain's meas
ure also calls for a sliding scale of
pension payments, from $75 to $100
a month depending on the cost of liv
ing. Also medical payments and
burial expenses are provided for.
Another bitterly contested pro
posal is Proposition Five which
calls for the establishment of a
state loyalty program.
The measure bars from public
oflicc those individuals who "ad
vocate the overthrow of the gov
ernment of the United Stales or
of the State of California by force
or violence or other unlawful
means."
The proponents of the measure
point out that "a few Communists in

key civilian defense or other gov
ernmental spots can cause untold
damage" and claim that the proposi
tion will keep state government free
of Red infiltration.
Opponents say the proposition
is framed in ambiguities. They
point out that under the MeCarran
Act the word "advocates" means
"speaking in favor of, giving sup
port to, admitting to belief in."
But, they ask, "What is speaking
in favor of" mean. Could a simple
discussion of Communist philos
ophy be construed to mean "advo
cate'' by government agents'.'"
they continue.
They further point out that to en
force such a measure a police net
work would have to be establish at
considerable cost to the taxpayer.
. Tied closely with Proposition Five
is Proposition Six, which makes the
much argued Loyalty Oath part of
the State Constitution. The proposi
tion widens the sweep of the Oath
to include all public employees, even
to the county and city levels.
Those campaigning for the meas
ure insist that the Oath would
make if possible "to keep Com
munists out of public jobs—for an
oath violator becomes subject to
trial for perjury, facing fine or
imprisonment."
But those opposing the proposition,
speaking out in the handbook pre
pared for voters by Secretary of
State Frank Jordan, say. "This pro
posal is a serious threat to |our|
democratic freedoms. Its passage
would be a mandate to the Legis
lature to establish an authority to
investigate and snoop into the lives
of all the people, even on irrelevant
matters."
Cross filing, ail old lnig-a-boo
of political debate in this state, is
another of the crucial issues.
There are two propositions that
deal with the cross filing systems,
Seven which provides that candi
dates must designate their party
affiliations 011 the primary ballot,
and i:i which calls for abolition of
the system.
Seven, by placing the party affili
ation of the candidate on the ballot,
will reduce one of the charged
abuses of the cross filing system.
Cross filing, most partisan or
ganizations in the state say, tends
to create confusion in the voters'
mind. But, say proponents of
seven, this confusion can be elimi
nated by making clear the party
sympathy of the candidate.
Many in the state feel that com
plete abolition of the system is de
sirable. Those favoring 13 declare
"the primary, should allow the
voters of each party to nominate

its candidates and decide its internal
questions of leadership and policy."
This cannot be done, they conclude,
under cross filing.
But opponents to the- measure,
also speaking in the Commonwealth,
counter, "Proposition 13—a radical
change in California's election laws
—this is a denial of the right to vote
according to individual conviction
and judgment in a primary election.
It has been the right and privilege
of the California electorate to vote
for the man best suited for the job,
regardless of political party affilia
tion, for 39 years."
California voters have several
momentous decisions to make
Tuesday when they march to the
polls.
Should they vote the repeal oi
crossfiling? Should they okay
the establishment of a stiff new
loyalty program? Should they
provide lor a state managed wel
fare program?
These are but a few of the im
portant measures embodied in the
set of 24 proposed amendments to
the California constitution on the
ballot this year.
Of the 24 proposed ballot meas
ures, five stand out as crucial. These
are Proposition Five, outlining an
intensive loyalty program; Proposi
tion Six, requiring all public em
ployes to take a loyalty oath; Prop
osition Seven, calling for candidates
under cross filing to designate party
affiiliations on the ballot; Proposition
11, outlining a state welfare pro
