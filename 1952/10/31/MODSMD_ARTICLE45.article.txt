LEAPIN' LYNN—The key to San Jose State's hopes for a win
over Stanford tomorrow will be Quarterback Lynn Aplanalp,
162-pound senior, who ranks eighth in the nation in total yard
age. The Spartan ace has amassed 876 yards in five games—
most of which has come through the air. Last year against Stan
ford Lynn led the Staters to 253 yards and 17 first downs, despite
a 26-13 loss.
