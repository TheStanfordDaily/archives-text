# UCLA Crucial Faces Mermen
## 
### 
The game that can oossibly make, j
but definitely break the Card water
polo team will get under way this
afternoon at 4 in the Encina Gym
pool. The league - leading UCLA
seven dive in against the Stanford
mermen.
Stanford, last year's PCC title
holder, find them.-elves in third
place with a one win, two loss league
record. The Bruins, who have
dunked USC, Cal, and Stanford,
sport an unblemished 3-0 murk.
This is the "must" game for the In
dians if they are to .••tay in the race.
The big Mumbling block on the ■
victory path is I lie sensational
Jack Spurgo. Card Coach Tom i
Ilaynie rales Sparrgo as one of tl)e
best players oil the Canst, if not
the best. Haynic commented that
"without Spat go UCLA wouldn't ;
stand a chance of winning."
A couple of Spurgo's more miruo- |
uious feats this year have been his ]
eight goals in one j.-ame against Ca!
and his single-handed victory ovei
the Cards as he provided all the
scoring in the 6-5 tu.isle at Los An
geles. The Indian deefnse complete- j
iy stymied San Jose last Tuesday in j
their 7-1 win and might come up j
with a solution to the problem of I
the Olympic star.
