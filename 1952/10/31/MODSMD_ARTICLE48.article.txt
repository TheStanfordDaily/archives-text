It will be the first gridiron ap
pearance in the Bay Area for Me-
Coll since last year's performance in
the Big Game.
Halas said that McColl had won
the offensive left end spot and ex
pected him to be a key man for the
Bears during the remaining games
on the schedule.
At their Menlo training camp
the 48ers devoted a brisk drill to
working on Chicago defensive pat
terns.
Coach Buck Shaw said that Joe
Perry's injured toe showed im

back would be ready lor action
Sunday.
Tackle Ray Collins is still on the
doubtful list.
Norm Standlee has had the heavy
cast removed on the wrist he frac
tured earlier this month and was
out running to get his legs back in
shape.
