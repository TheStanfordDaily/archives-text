## We Have Something New 
### 
This morning we turn from active athletics to heap praise upon an
approaching giant in the Held of literary endeavor.
On Thursday November sixth a book, "CHEAT MOMENTS IN STAN
FORD SPORTS" will be put on Campus sale.
This 120-page volume first came to our attention as a result «»f having
contributed a tidbit. This should not discredit the hook as we ate
travelling in very good company and any damage we do is more than
offset by contributors of such caliber as Bill Leiser. Dick I'riemllich
and Art llosenbaum of the San Francisco Chronicle, Bud Spenc.'r, Sport*
Editor of llu* San Francisco News, George I)iivis and Kube Samuelseti
(op (light f.os Angeles writers and Palo Alio Times Sports Editor Walt
Carnage.
Herbert Hoover, Chuck Taylor, Everett Dean, Don Liebendorfer, Dinl*
Templeton, BoLby Grayson, Frankie Albert, all great Stanford names, aro
also contributors.
The book is a history of Stanford sports but one that will be a pleasure
to read. Many attempts have been made on Stanford Sports, but this
is the first one ever published, and you don't have to be an all-out
sports enthusiast to enjoy the writings. The book will acquaint you with
the greats of the past and present. It will trace Stanford's athletics from
the first Big game to the recent Olympics where Bob Mat bias left bis
mark as did a Stanford crew.
GREAT MOMENTS IN STANFORD SPORTS will relate in detail how
the first Big Game v/as held up because someone forgot a football, the
1924 Big Game that old timers swear was the all time best, and last year's
USC game which the present generation declares to be tops.
Stories of the Vow Boys, who vowed never to lose lo CSC and didn't
of the first "T" formation team on the coast, and of coaches, Pop Warner
and Chuck Taylor are all given good play!
There is a story on the Stanford Axe, its theft by Cal and the recovery
by the Immortal Twenty-One.
There are stories on basketball greats, llank Lnisetti, George Yardley,
and Ed Tucker.
Stanford's achievements in track, water sports, golf, baseball and minor
sports are all dealt with.
In total there are close to thirty separate accounts of GREAT MO
MENTS IN STANFORD SPORTS, some lf> paces of art and a section of
just enough statistics for the complete enthusiast.
Our colleague Pete Grothe has done a wonderful job in editing ond
contributing to the book and Pacific Press has handled printing and
binding and will attend to distribution off campus.
Although GItEAT MOMENTS IN STANFORD SPORTS will be sold
on Quad corners next Thursday, this is not another Chappie or cartoon
book. Following Campus sales the book will be stocked in local, Sail
Francisco, and Los Angeles book stores as well as being offered to Alumni
and the Buck of the Month Club through appropriate advertising.
And the bad news is not bad at all. GREAT MOMENTS IN STAN
FORD SPORTS in a stiff paper edition with book jacket costs $1.50 while
the cloth bound more sturdy edition with a paper jacket feoes at $2.50.
