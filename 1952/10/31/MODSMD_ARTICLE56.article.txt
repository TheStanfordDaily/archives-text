# Cal-UCLA Meet In Crucial Tilt
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 30 (UP)
! —California and UCLA, two of the
: West Coast's gridiron powerhouses,
1 [.angle Saturday in the West Coast's
' game of the week."
This is the battle that could throw
the race for the Pacific Coast Con
ference championship and the Rose
Bowl bid wide open. If the Bears
should win, it will leave only USC
! as the undefeated contender for the
' title.
The Trojans are idle this week,
| but still must play Stanford, Wash
ington, and UCLA on successive
; weekends.
However, the undefeated UCLA
outfit figures to be at least a 50-50
shot to hand California its second
consecutive lacing. The Bruin de
fense, highlighted by linebackers

Donn Moomaw and Terry Debay, is
supposed to be of such rock-ribbed
caliber that it will smother Cali
fornia's vaunted offensive threats,
Johnny Olszewski, Don Johnson,
and Bill Powell.
One item generally overlooked in
the gridiron speculations at this
time is that University of Washing
ton still is very much in the race.'
The Huskies have been drubbed by
UCLA—but they have only one loss
on their PCC record. This week
they play Oregon State, and if they
get by the Beavers they'll be lead
ing the league in games won—if
California should happen to whip
UCLA.
If Don Heinrich passes as well as
he did in shellacking Stanford la.st
week, the Huskies still could be

counted a major threat. They still
have a tough road ahead, however.
After Oregon State come California
and Southern California on succes
sive weekends, before meeting arch
rival Washington State on Nov. 29.
Washington State and Idaho, both
teams with unimpressive records,
tangle in another PCC game in the
north country. Oregon goes oubide
the conference to entertain College
of the Pacific; and Stanford plays
its neighborhood rival, San Jose
State.
Santa Clara, which won its first
fiame of the season last week from
Idaho, tries for No. 2 against Har
dinSimmons at Lodi Saturday night.
In other games, San Diego State
meets Fresno State, and Santa Bar
abra tangles with the Cal Aggies.
