# Stanford Leads 9-0 In Spartan Series
## 
### 
When Chuck Taylor's slightly
! soiled but still potent Indians face
■ San Jose State's high-flying Spar
j tans tomorrow afternoon in Stan
ford Stadium, it will mark the 10th
! time in 52 years that Golden Raider
| elevens have attempted to subdue
| Stanford on the gridiron.
Way back in 1900, Stanford,
couched by Fielding Yost of later
Michigan immortality, opened the
I series with a pair of decisive yins,
35 to 0 and 24 to 0.
The series was then discontinued
until 1933 when in successive years
the PCC champion Vow Boys hum
bled the Staters, 27 to 0, 4y to 0, and
,35 to 0. Then came another lapse
until 1948 when an aroused Spartan
teafn nearly pulled an upset before
falling 26 to 20.
After reassuming ilie role of
"doormat" in a 49 to 0 rout in
. 194!), Coach Bob Bron/an's men
have come back to give Card

elevens two consecutive good
games.
Last year in their second outing
of the season, Taylor's eventual PCC
champs found themselves in a real
struggle for almost two quarters
struggle for almost two. quarter*
before Gary Kerkorian finally
pulled his famous stop-and-go boot
leg run to break up the game.
Even at that, the final score was
still a very modest 26 to 13.
Going into this game, the Spar
tans are riding a four-game win
ning streak after being edged by
a tough Colorado team 211 to 14
in their opener. Add to this the

fact that the Bron/an-men took
last weekend oIT and should he
well rested.
Add the fact that the Spartan
backfield, led by ace passer Lynn
Aplanalp and fullback Dick Stults
is second in the nation in total of
fense this season, and one can see
wily Stanford may have its hands
full tomorrow.

,35 to 0. Then came another lapse
until 1948 when an aroused Spartan
teafn nearly pulled an upset before
falling 26 to 20.
After reassuming ilie role of
"doormat" in a 49 to 0 rout in
. 194!), Coach Bob Bron/an's men
have come back to give Card

elevens two consecutive good
games.
Last year in their second outing
of the season, Taylor's eventual PCC
champs found themselves in a real
struggle for almost two quarters
struggle for almost two. quarter*
before Gary Kerkorian finally
pulled his famous stop-and-go boot
leg run to break up the game.
Even at that, the final score was
still a very modest 26 to 13.
Going into this game, the Spar
tans are riding a four-game win
ning streak after being edged by
a tough Colorado team 211 to 14
in their opener. Add to this the

fact that the Bron/an-men took
last weekend oIT and should he
well rested.
Add the fact that the Spartan
backfield, led by ace passer Lynn
Aplanalp and fullback Dick Stults
is second in the nation in total of
fense this season, and one can see
wily Stanford may have its hands
full tomorrow.
