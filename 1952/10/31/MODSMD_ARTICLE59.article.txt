SAN JOSE, Oct. :i»—San Jose
State, riding a four-game winning
streak, heads up tin* Peninsula IX
miles Saturday for the Spartans
annual crack at Stanford. The
Spartans have not beaten the In
dians in nine previous attempts,
hut Spartan fans think San Jose
has its best chance thi> week since
the 194 X game when the Indians
overcame a 2tl-poinl Spartan lead
in the final 1H minutes.
'1 he Spartans, who were second
in the nation last week both in
rushing and in total offense, are
expected to move on the Indians,
but San Jose's major problem
will Lv* whether they can stop the
passing of Bob (larrett and the
running of Bob Mathias and his
backfield mates.
San Jose, which was idle last
week, will have a versatile attack
prepared for Stanford. Lynn Ap
lanalp, whose passing and running
placed hint second in the nation
last week in total offense, directs
Bob Bron/an's well-balanced of
fense which also boasts the run
ning of Dick Stulls, fifth in the
nation in rushing last week; Lar
ry Matthews, whose average tfain
per plav is high among the na
tion's leaders; Al Matthews,
brother of Lurry; Bill Walker,
Bob Hamilton, and veteran Bob
Osborne, whose running was a
highlight of the Spartans' game
with Stanford last yea.*.
