# Indians Cheered By kid Rooters

### DAVE BROWNWOOD 
"OK, kids. Take a couple of
deep breaths and yell."
A high-pitched roar rises from
the A A section of the Stadium,
opposite the players' entrance,
and student rooters know the
team is on its way onto the field.
The Palo Alto kids have again
the first lo spnl the Cards, Four
thousand shrill voices let the rest
of Ihr Stadium know it.
"Wc first, started leading the kids
in yells two years ago," explains
Student Policeman Joe Chez, also
known for his pitching on the Stan
ford baseball squad.
Before student police worked
only to keep the kids in line. Now
they are all yell-leaders. "Lead
in 2 the kids in yells," smiles Joe,
"helps them use up their excess
energy."
During most home games section
AA is open free to all San Mateo
County kids under 12. Until Joe
and his brother, Fred Chez began
yelling in 1050, student police had
quite a chore supervising the three

to four thousand young rooters.
In t!). r »l Joe was aprointcd cap
tain in charge of the kids section,
and expanded his yell Icadinir.
"The aggressive kids were changed
to helpers," states the baseball
player, "and instead of causing
trouble they helped to hold the
others in."
"They all want to get into the
Stanford rooting section." says Joe,
"One fellow told me it had always
hoen his ambition to sit with the
Stanford rooters.
"Their greatest thrill comes
when the student body (rives them
the 'Ilello, kids' yell before every
game. I usually lead them in a
return veil for the Stanford root
ers, though it is kind of hard to
hear on the opposite side of the
stadium." The kids' favorite Stan
ford institutions seem to be stu
dent rooters and Pom-Pom girls,
.lee believes that "they all want to
conic to Stanford."
The "Heap Chief Cop" and his
brother worked full time in the
kids' section during the '50 and '51
grid seasons. Although Joe and Fred
still lead a few yells before the game

to yet things started, they hold other
student police positions now.
"Two years on the 'beehive',"
states Joe, clue to graduate in the
winter quarter, "were enough for
me." "I liked the kids, though, and
running up and down the stadium
steps helped keep me in shape for
baseball."
Present Student Policemen sta
tioned on the "beehive" describe it
as "worse than Ladies' Day at
Ebbctt's Field." "You need a good
night's rest after the game," sighed
Stan Lewis as he corraled a young
hopeful back into the section. "But
it's fun."

(lie kids' rooting section at the
Washington game last week.
"OK, kids. Take a couple of
deep breaths and yell."
A high-pitched roar rises from
the A A section of the Stadium,
opposite the players' entrance,
and student rooters know the
team is on its way onto the field.
The Palo Alto kids have again
the first lo spnl the Cards, Four
thousand shrill voices let the rest
of Ihr Stadium know it.
"Wc first, started leading the kids
in yells two years ago," explains
Student Policeman Joe Chez, also
known for his pitching on the Stan
ford baseball squad.
Before student police worked
only to keep the kids in line. Now
they are all yell-leaders. "Lead
in 2 the kids in yells," smiles Joe,
"helps them use up their excess
energy."
During most home games section
AA is open free to all San Mateo
County kids under 12. Until Joe
and his brother, Fred Chez began
yelling in 1050, student police had
quite a chore supervising the three

to four thousand young rooters.
In t!). r »l Joe was aprointcd cap
tain in charge of the kids section,
and expanded his yell Icadinir.
"The aggressive kids were changed
to helpers," states the baseball
player, "and instead of causing
trouble they helped to hold the
others in."
"They all want to get into the
Stanford rooting section." says Joe,
"One fellow told me it had always
hoen his ambition to sit with the
Stanford rooters.
"Their greatest thrill comes
when the student body (rives them
the 'Ilello, kids' yell before every
game. I usually lead them in a
return veil for the Stanford root
ers, though it is kind of hard to
hear on the opposite side of the
stadium." The kids' favorite Stan
ford institutions seem to be stu
dent rooters and Pom-Pom girls,
.lee believes that "they all want to
conic to Stanford."
The "Heap Chief Cop" and his
brother worked full time in the
kids' section during the '50 and '51
grid seasons. Although Joe and Fred
still lead a few yells before the game

to yet things started, they hold other
student police positions now.
"Two years on the 'beehive',"
states Joe, clue to graduate in the
winter quarter, "were enough for
me." "I liked the kids, though, and
running up and down the stadium
steps helped keep me in shape for
baseball."
Present Student Policemen sta
tioned on the "beehive" describe it
as "worse than Ladies' Day at
Ebbctt's Field." "You need a good
night's rest after the game," sighed
Stan Lewis as he corraled a young
hopeful back into the section. "But
it's fun."
