MENARD, 111., Oct. 30 (UP) â€”
Democratic presidential nominee
Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson will fly
here tonight in an attempt to settle
a four-day-old prison rebellion, it
was announced tonight.
Three hundred convicts in the
state prison here, hollow eyed and
haggard from hunger but still hold
ing seven guards as hostages tonight
refused new attempts to negotiate
a settlement of the riot.
Sherwood Dixon, acting for cam
paigning Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson,
gave ground slightly late tonight
when he promised the rioters there
would be no reprisals if they would
surrender the guards and restore
order, and providing no prison prop
erty was damaged.
