# Party Stands Compared As Election Time Nears
## 
### HADLEY ROFF Daily Political Editor 
Dwight Eisenhower ends his bid for votes tonight when he
addresses a rally in Boston. Adlai Stevenson brought his cam
paign to a conclusion Saturday in Chicago.
Which candidate has v/aged the more effective campaign? Well,
at this point most people can only shrug their shoulders in doubt.

Republican and Democratic
leaders both admit the outcome
of the election is extremely doubt
ful.
Such doubt is causing workers in
both parties to labor with renewed
vigor to get out the vote tomorrow.
Political analysts across the coun
try predict tomorrow's vote will be
the largest in the nation's history,
with at least 65 million persons ex
pected to crowd the polling booths.
In California, 5,988,300 have reg
istered to vote, the largest number
in the state's history.
California, this year, plays a key
role in naming the President.
Both parties say the election will
be close and will hinge on the
vote of three large states, New
York, Pennsylvania, and Califor
nia.
Of chief interest to California vot
ers, and voters of the nation for that
matter, has been the Korean issue.
The Republicans have said of
Korea:
"The first task of a new admin
istration will he to review and re
examine every course of action
open to us with one goal in view:
To bring the Korean war to an
early and honorable end. . . . The
job requires a personal trip to
Korea. I shall make that trip."—
Eisenhower, Oct. 24, Detroit.
The Democrats have said:
"J believe we mav in time look
hack at Korea as a maior turn
ing point in history — a turning
point which led not to another
terrible war, but to the first his
toric demonstration that an effec
tive system of collective security
is possible. , . . Having failed to
defeat us on the field of battle.

the enemy now seeks to defeat
us by prolonging the negotiations
am! by exhausting our patience.
"But some men in this country
seem to think that if definitive vic
tory cannot be won, wc should ei
ther take reckless military action or
give the whole thing up. Such ad
vice plays into the enemy's hands.
The contest between tyranny is not
a hundred-yard dash—it is a test of
endurance." — Stevenson, Sept. !),
San Francisco.
Another important issue is that
of the welfare state:
Republicans have had this to say:
The social pains achieved by Hie
people "whether enacted hv a Re
publican or a Democratic adminis
tration are not only lure to stay
but are here to be improved and
expanded."—Eisenhower, Nov. 1,
New York.
The Democrats have said this:
"Democratic administrations
have produced a great deal of so
cial reforms of our era. The Dem
ocratic party can be trusted to
stand by these reforms. We will
extend and complete them." Ste
venson. Sept. 19, Springfield, Mass.
Then there is the heated question
about. Communists in Government.
The Republicans said:
Referring to an articlc in the
'Communist Daily Worker that
described Stevenson as less bad
than Eisenhower, Senator Joseph
McCarthy claimed, "This consti
tutes a complete endorsement and
orders Communists to support
Stevenson."—Oct. 27, Chicago.
Eisenhower said that a Republican
administration would "stamp out
disloyalty in government" without
engaging in "witch hunts or charac
ter assassination." — Nov. 1, New
York.
The Democrats have saitl of Com
munism:
"Now Communism in the Unit
ed States is an ugly and sinister
thing. It requires our most seri
ous and relentless attention, but
men who seek to fight it by indis
criminate accusation of the'r fel
low citizens . . . by spreading sus
picion and smear and slander, are
serving no one but the Commu
nists themselves. , . .
"In fighting Communism at home,
I shall rely on such experienced
guardians of our security as J. Ed
gar Hoover of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation and Gen. Bedell
Smith of the Central Intelligence
Agency. These men fight Commu
nism as it must be fought — with
care, thoroughness, precision, and
silence."—Stevenson, Oct. 23, New
York.
On labor, both candidates have
declared for a more equitable policy
toward the working man. Steven
son has advocated repeal of the
Taft - Hartley law, Eisenhower has
not.
On tidelands oil and FEPC, two
other crucial issues, the candidates
stand poles apart. Stevenson has
urged adoption of a federally ad
ministered FEPC program. Eisen
hower has not, saying that states
should administer such a program.
On tidelands, Stevenson has cham
pioned federal control. Eisenhower
has defended state authority.

administration would "stamp out

"Now Communism in the Unit

thing. It requires our most seri

men who seek to fight it by indis

On labor, both candidates have
declared for a more equitable policy
toward the working man. Steven
son has advocated repeal of the
Taft - Hartley law, Eisenhower has
not.
On tidelands oil and FEPC, two
other crucial issues, the candidates
stand poles apart. Stevenson has
urged adoption of a federally ad
ministered FEPC program. Eisen
hower has not, saying that states
should administer such a program.
On tidelands, Stevenson has cham
pioned federal control. Eisenhower
has defended state authority.
Dwight Eisenhower ends his bid for votes tonight when he
addresses a rally in Boston. Adlai Stevenson brought his cam
paign to a conclusion Saturday in Chicago.
Which candidate has v/aged the more effective campaign? Well,
at this point most people can only shrug their shoulders in doubt.

Republican and Democratic
leaders both admit the outcome
of the election is extremely doubt
ful.
Such doubt is causing workers in
both parties to labor with renewed
vigor to get out the vote tomorrow.
Political analysts across the coun
try predict tomorrow's vote will be
the largest in the nation's history,
with at least 65 million persons ex
pected to crowd the polling booths.
In California, 5,988,300 have reg
istered to vote, the largest number
in the state's history.
California, this year, plays a key
role in naming the President.
Both parties say the election will
be close and will hinge on the
vote of three large states, New
York, Pennsylvania, and Califor
nia.
Of chief interest to California vot
ers, and voters of the nation for that
matter, has been the Korean issue.
The Republicans have said of
Korea:
"The first task of a new admin
istration will he to review and re
examine every course of action
open to us with one goal in view:
To bring the Korean war to an
early and honorable end. . . . The
job requires a personal trip to
Korea. I shall make that trip."—
Eisenhower, Oct. 24, Detroit.
The Democrats have said:
"J believe we mav in time look
hack at Korea as a maior turn
ing point in history — a turning
point which led not to another
terrible war, but to the first his
toric demonstration that an effec
tive system of collective security
is possible. , . . Having failed to
defeat us on the field of battle.

the enemy now seeks to defeat
us by prolonging the negotiations
am! by exhausting our patience.
"But some men in this country
seem to think that if definitive vic

give the whole thing up. Such ad

The contest between tyranny is not
a hundred-yard dash—it is a test of
endurance." — Stevenson, Sept. !),
San Francisco.
Another important issue is that
of the welfare state:
Republicans have had this to say:

people "whether enacted hv a Re
publican or a Democratic adminis

but are here to be improved and
expanded."—Eisenhower, Nov. 1,
New York.
