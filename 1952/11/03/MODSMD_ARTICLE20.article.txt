## On Cross Filing 
### 
To the Editor:
Itj reference to Jim Madison's editorial of Oct. .'>(),
it appears that writer Madison is a little misinforming
(: icj as to the real evils of the cross filing system.
To begin with, the whole system of cross filing is
on a shaky basis. How can a candidate be a Re
publican and a Democrat at the same time? This is
what cross filing forces the office-seeker to become.
When a candidate cross files, who is to say to which
party he is responsible or to which platform will he
adhere?
The primary election is supposed to In; the elec
tion when registered members of a party choose
the candidates in their party for a political office,
if you are a Republican you vote in the Republican
primnry and if you are a Democrat you vote in the
Democratic primary.
As a Republican, I have no more right to choose
U tween members of the Democratic party than be
tween members of the Conservative party in Great
Britain. In the final election I have my choice be
tween tiie Democratic or Republican candidate.
In many, many cases the voter goes to the polls
in the general election without a choice because
some candidate has captured the primary. With
cro s filing we may as well eliminate the primary
112 lection for its purpose of promoting the integrity
el' the parties is defeated. It would be no different if
\\( had Candidate's names amassed on one roll and
I nun them choose our officers. This effects the situa
tion that cross filing has left us. Remember our
government is based on a party system; cross filing
kill parties.
Look at the legislature of California. Have you
heard of a man called Artie Sarnish? Cross filing
(>iit him in office, not as an elected official but as
the controller of several state senators and as
semblymen who have gained office through cross
filing trickery.
Men like Sarnish, and there are several in this
sti'te, have direct influence on the state legislature
without having to work through the compromising
element which has made our government what it is
today—the party.
Our state politics have become a battle of the in
teiests on the floor of the legislature.
Don't fear Boss control, it went out with Tammany
Hall. The heart of the system has been cut out; it
cannot operate effectively any more.
I urge you to help put an end to this monster of
private interests and return government to the party
system. Don't fence-sit like cross filing advocates
want you to do by supporting Proposition No. 7 and
defeating No. 33. Let's get rid of this system once and
for ail Vote "YES" on Proposition 13.

Democratic primary.
As a Republican, I have no more right to choose
U tween members of the Democratic party than be
tween members of the Conservative party in Great
Britain. In the final election I have my choice be
tween tiie Democratic or Republican candidate.
In many, many cases the voter goes to the polls
in the general election without a choice because
some candidate has captured the primary. With
cro s filing we may as well eliminate the primary
112 lection for its purpose of promoting the integrity
el' the parties is defeated. It would be no different if
\\( had Candidate's names amassed on one roll and
I nun them choose our officers. This effects the situa
tion that cross filing has left us. Remember our
government is based on a party system; cross filing
kill parties.
Look at the legislature of California. Have you
heard of a man called Artie Sarnish? Cross filing
(>iit him in office, not as an elected official but as
the controller of several state senators and as
semblymen who have gained office through cross
filing trickery.
Men like Sarnish, and there are several in this
sti'te, have direct influence on the state legislature
without having to work through the compromising
element which has made our government what it is
today—the party.
Our state politics have become a battle of the in
teiests on the floor of the legislature.
Don't fear Boss control, it went out with Tammany
Hall. The heart of the system has been cut out; it
cannot operate effectively any more.
I urge you to help put an end to this monster of
private interests and return government to the party
system. Don't fence-sit like cross filing advocates
want you to do by supporting Proposition No. 7 and
defeating No. 33. Let's get rid of this system once and
for ail Vote "YES" on Proposition 13.

it appears that writer Madison is a little misinforming
(: icj as to the real evils of the cross filing system.
To begin with, the whole system of cross filing is
on a shaky basis. How can a candidate be a Re
publican and a Democrat at the same time? This is
what cross filing forces the office-seeker to become.
When a candidate cross files, who is to say to which
party he is responsible or to which platform will he
adhere?
The primary election is supposed to In; the elec

the candidates in their party for a political office,
