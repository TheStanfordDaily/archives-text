# More on Cross Filing
## 
### 
To the Editor:
In last Wednesday's Daily, Associate Editor Jim
Madison called for the rejection of proposition 13
and the adoption of proposition 7.
He argued that by voting this wwy, the evils of
cross filing would be overcome and that the evils
of party bossism would not be incurred.
He cited that by abolishing cross filing a Repub
lican voter would be unable to vote for 'a Demo
crat if he thought the Democrat better qualified.'
This argument is utterly falacious because without
cross filing all voters, Democratic, Republican and
Independent may choose whoever they wish in a
general election—they would not be bound to sup
port the man of their party.
The real evils of cross filing were conveniently ig
nored by Mr. Madison. These evils are due to the
incumbent in the state leigslature usually being re
turned to office during the "no campaign-light vote"
primary. In the last primary over 90 percent of the
assembly- was elected at the primary. There are no
contests being waged iw these districts now.
Why is this bad? It is bad because during a pri
mary election, when party funds can not be spent,
no campaign is waged. The incumbent, whose name
appears first on the ballot, is usually returned to
oflice. In this way. it is very easy for lobbyists—
particularly the liquor lobbyists in this state— to con
trol the state legislature.
Furthermore, if a man is elected at the primary,
the true independent who does not wish to afliliate
himself with any party .is deprived of his vote dur
ing the general election.
It is interesting to note that John B. Elliot, the man
who led the fight to establish cross filing forty years
ago. has realized the greater dangers of this system
and is now head of the Citizens Committee for
Propo .ition 13.
