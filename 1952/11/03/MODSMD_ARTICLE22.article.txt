# Against No. 3

To the Editor:
Lest Jim Madison's editorial favoring Proposition 3
in last Friday's Daily sway anyone unacquainted
with the actual situation, here are some hard facts.
(Proposition 3, as most everyone knows, would extend
property tax exemption to "schools of less than col
legiate grade owned and operated by non-profit
religious, hospital, or charitable organizations.")
1. A State Report on Education points out that of
the schools which would come under this exemption,
about 92 percent are Roman Catholic, with only four
percent ol other religious denominations. The re
maining four percent are presumably hospital and
charitable schools.
2. But what about that four percent of hospital
and charitable schools; will they lose out if the
amendment is not adopted? They won't lose one
cent. These schools are already exempted from prop
erly tax by the Welfare Exemption Act of 1944! Why,
then, should these institutions be included in an
amendment which proposes to give them what they
already have? Undoubtedly this was done to obscure
the real beneficiaries of the bill and make it more
palatable; for probably everyone would favor ex
empting schools for the blind, crippled, and so forth.
3. Jim Madison cites the $41,000,000 which non
profit private schools are supposed to save the tax
payer annually. The value of this point as an argu
ment is exactly zero, because if the bill is defeated,
these schools, supported by a wealthy Church, will
most certainly not close down. They will continue
to function as they always have.
4. Few people seem to realize that Proposition 3
is a blanket exemption, with no limitations! No other
state in the Union has seen fit to endorse such a bill.
