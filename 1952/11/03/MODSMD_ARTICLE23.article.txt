# 'Ethical Values'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
If a political party is to mean something other than
merely a group of ambitious politicians temporarily
united in a struggle for power, then its members
must hold some ethical values in common. In par
ticular, a political party in a parliamentary democ
racy must, if the system is to survive, subscribe to
certain elementary notions, such as the importance
of truth and responsibility. The tactics employed by
Senator McCarthy and his associates are a flagrant
violation of such basic standards.
Elected or not, the Republican candidate is Mc-
Carthy's party superior, and it just will not do to
say, in excuse, that Eisenhower does not condone the
actions of such men as McCarthy; simply for him
to tolerate them in the same party Ls a tacit admission
either that their standards are not fundamentally
different from his, or that the party lacks any co
hesive principles. Neither alternative reflects credit
on either candidate or party.
