To the Editor:
In regard to Oct. 30 "McCarthyism" and "Concerns
of Alumni":
George Bernard Shaw said a mouthful in his
speech to the British people in 1938, when he suc
cinctly remarked, "History teaches us that people
never learn anything from history."
Mr. Menninger has forgotten the compromise tech
nique of Neville Chamberlain in dealing with Adolf
Hitler, a man almost equal in fame with the Un
known Soldier. Saying to Mr. McCarthy, "Be a good
boy, we're on your side" is what is known as ap
peasement.
Mrs. McMullin is equally guilty. Would she accuse
Tom Paine of "me-too-ism" because h e did not
originate the American Revolution?
Is it not inconsistent, also, to wave the flag of non
partisanship for Stanford, and then congratulate the
actions of the "bleacher-alumni?"
