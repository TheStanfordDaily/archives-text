# Support of FEPC

To the Editor:
In opposition to Mr. Pantc-11, we declare our sup
port of FEPC. Fair employment practices legislation
has for its objective the putting into practice what
we say we have believed in since 1776. Such legis
lation would insure fairness and equality in employ
ment practices by prohibiting discrimination therein
on the basis of race, color, or creed. Such legislation
has been adopted and proved successful in a number
of states and in the city of Richmond here in Cali
fornia. If it is this Mr. Pantell disagrees with, let
him recognize his position for what it is—racism,
not Americanism.
