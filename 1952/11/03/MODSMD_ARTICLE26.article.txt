# 'We Are Fortunate'

To the Editor:
It was interesting, and not surprising, that a num
ber of Daily readers leaped at "Republican" Pantell's
clever, if not too subtle bait (Campus Opinion, Wed.,
Oct. 29). It is great fun to"flail away at the straw-man
Republican, money-hoarding and worker-hating, that
President Truman has created and is now so care
fully nourishing (or in the case of this alfalfa-stuffed
target, padding).
A letter similar in tone to Mr. Pantell's, present
ing a parody of the extreme leftist viewpoint (eg.
defending Alger Hiss' duty to steal the secrets of
war-mongering Wall Streetists, praising the fore
sighted State Department advisers who promoted
Mao's "people's republic" in China, or the like)
would probably draw just as many sharp, well
written rebuttals. Such is the sort of Democratic
nonentity Senator McCarthy is currently belabor
ing.
It is no doubt true, although regrettable, that there
are some American whose views might approach
those caricatured by Mi*. Pantell. There are also
those representing the extreme opposite viewpoint, as
has been so gently hinted by McCarthy. But between
such extremes lies a broad, graduated series of
opinions. Clearly l>oth candidates are attempting to
follow a middle road; neither will allow himself to
be controlled by the extremist forces, right or left,
in either party.
If voters will patiently bear through this painful
"anything for votes" political campaign and worry
less about sterotyped political whipping-boys, they
will be grateful for the chance to choose between
two such good men. We are fortunate not. to be
faced with candidates so unrepresentative as soon
to-be-ex (?) Senator McCarthy and soon-to-be-ex
(!) President Truman.
