# 'Absenteeism'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Here is an interesting fact which has probably gone
unnoticed in the excitement of the presidential race.
The League of Women Voters has compiled the
voting record of all U.S. Senators and Representatives
on fitteen ''significant roll calls" in each house be
tween January and July of this year. The list was
published in the Christian Science Monitor of Oct. 25.
Looking over the Senatorial record, I find that Senator
Knowland did not vote on eight of the fifteen roll
calls: in other words, the people of California were
only partially represented (by Senator Nixon) on
such key issues as import restrictions, mutual se
curity, Point 4," and rent, Y a R e - an( 4 price controls.
The amount of absenteeism in the United Stales
Senate is notorious but that unhappy fact does not
excuse Senator Knowland's apparent dereliction
of duty. I nless there was a valid reason why he
voted on less than half of this vital legislation, it
seems that lie was doing only half a job.
The ballot that we mark on Nov. 4 gives us a
choice between Senator Knowland and an "Inde
pendent Progressive" candidate. For most of us this
although admittedly a negative and unsatisfactory
is no choice at all. My own solution to the problem—
one—is not to vote for Senator. I will salve my
conscience with a Yes vote on Proposition 13: perhaps
the abolition of cross-filing may stimulate Senator
Knowland and his successors to do the most im
portant part of the job the.v are paid for.
