# On McCarthy

To (he Editor:
Wisconsin's private-eye of the gutter class is at work again heaving
slanderous statements at the public again—this time about Adlai Stevenson.
It seems that Wisconsin's Senator McCarthy has once again caught the
"communist" bug and is spreading it to the rest of the population. I
should hope that not all Wisconsonians are as feeble-minded as they
appear to be by the election of McCarthy to the Senate.
Let me outline the probable thought pattern of Senator McCarthy in
his communist accusations.
Q. Who don't I like? A. Stevenson.
Q. Whut can I do about it? A. Make the public dislike him.
Q. How can I do that? A. Call him a Red.
Q. How can I legally call him "a Ked? A. Find a committee with
which he was slightly related and see if it was investigated.
That won't be hard for most committees were investigated
at some time.
There you have it: the thought pattern of a mental midget whose entire
efforts are devoted to backwardness rather than forwardness. If Senator
McCarthy's health is in such poor condition that it so easily diseased by
the communist bug, he should be not in the Senate, but in a rest home.
Anyone who has listened with unbiased mind to both presidential can
didates can readily see that Gov. Stevenson is the more capable of the
two for the presidency. More able to lead the nation through these critical
times, more able to lead us away from another depression, and more able
to settle the Korean problem with less bloodshed. A few days ago General
Eisenhower stated that were he elected he would personally go to Korea
and settle the dispute. What he failed to state was exactly how he would
go about it. 1 can picture him, Hag in one hand. Bible in the other, saying
"Here, here, boys."
Again may I stress that what the people' of the United States fail to
realize is that through Stevenson we will be able to avoid another depres
sion; however, if General Eisenhower succeeds in winning the 'presidency,
I'm afraid will be another "usher us into the depression" Herbert Hoover.
