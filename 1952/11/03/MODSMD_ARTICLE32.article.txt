## Douglas Address 
### 
To the Editor:
I should like to call your attention to the excellent
address oi Mr. Lewis Douglas, former United States
Ambassador to Great Britain, in Ni*w York last week.
It is such a superior contribution to the current
foreign policy debute that the complete text is worth
reading.
The following excerpt from the Herald Tribune
editorial of Oct. 23 is a good summary of Mr. Douglas'
views, though, and I think the Daily would do well
to reprint it for Stanford :
"What was important in this speech was not merely
the searching analysis of tin? evils that have flowed
from wartime decisions. Equally important was what
Mr. Douglas called 'the theory of government respon
sibility.' In political debate blame for bad policy is
too often aflixed on grounds of morality or even
treason; conversely, blame is too often watered down
with all kinds of questions as to whether circum
stances were not difficult or whether there is proof
that others would have done better. Mr. Douglas cut
through all this. He raised no extraneous questions
about the motives of the party in power, He -did hot

weaken responsibility by saying that perhaps the
Democrats did as well as could have been expected.
He simply said: these decisions were piade; time has
proven them to be bad decisions; the men in charge
must be called to account.
"This approach, harsh as it may seem, is in fact the
only one that can properly characterize a mature
two-party system. Under this system the price that
men pay for being wrong is exclusion from power.
No one pretends that the new party, coming to the
seats o{ authority, is infallible; it is enough that
different officials be given a fair chance to do better.
In American politics this test of responsibility is par
ticularly necessary; for the opposition lacks coherent
leadership and is almost invariably divided. If it
were necessary to prove conclusively that the 'outs'
can solve all problems, the country would wait in
terminably for a necessary change in administration.
"The speech will stand, we believe, as one of those
rare but crucial utterances which even in the midst
of a campaign men remember and which affects their
thoujht and action."
