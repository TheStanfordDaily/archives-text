# An Opinion on Editorials
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Several times I have been on the verge of writing
a letter to the Daily concerning some of the articles
printed. After reading the two editorials written by
you and Miss Massey in the Oct. 29 issue, my self
control has given out.
First, concerning intellectual freedom. Just because
Joe McCarthy is rampant is no basis to assume that
the winds of freedom are about to cease. There are
too many intellects in our country, I hope, to listen
to, and believe, the type of guff that he is trying to
put over. The fact that McCarthy is known for what
he is, greatly reduces his influence.
As to the Eisenhower backing of McCarthy prov
ing that he endorses McCarthy's methods. This is
ridiculous. Perhaps Ike believes that to accomplish
the badly needed house cleaning he will need a
Republican majority in Congress. In any event, he
has shown obvious coolness to the Senator from
Wisconsin. If Ike wins, we are not going to become a
totalitarian state. In these accusations, Miss Dodge,
you are guilty of what you have been attacking Joe
McCarthy for doing. According to you, because
Ike's blanket endorsement covers McCarthy, Eisen
hower is a reactionary, immature, indiscreet, care
less, libelous, etc., in short all the things that Mc-
Carthy is. Miss Dodge please! Let's grow up to
coherency in our thinking.
As far as compromising for party unity, I notice
that Gov. Stevenson no longer disagrees with Harry
Truman, et al. Incidentally, Adlai disowned McCar
ran for supporting a Republican for Congress, not for
sponsoiing the immigration act.
Miss Massey, the beginning of your editorial sounds
like a witch's incantation. "Double, double, toil and
trouble; Fire burn, caldron bubble; Old soldiers fade
away!" If I were as strong a Republican as you seem
to be a Democrat, I might just as logically hope for
Adlai to drop dead. But that is a child's trick, and
I hope we are all above that by now. But I might
easily be wrong.
Ike's proposal for a trip to Korea seemed, and still
does, a fine idea. Just what are the restrictive
obstacles that are so obvious to you but not only
have escaped my attention but others also; for in

stance Steve Mitchell and Adlai Stevenson?
I don't see how such an excursion could possibly
lower the prestige of the Presidency of the United
States. Anyway, it couldn't get any lower than it is
now. Please don't forget that the President is Com
mander-in-Chief of all the armed forces. It seems
only natural that he should review his troops, both
to increase their moral and to see how things are
shaping up.
Miss Massey, you say that Ike wanting to go to
Korea is another way of contrasting the methods of
a military man to those of a statesman. If so, the
change is refreshing. The statesmen haven't ac
complished anything, so maybe a new approach,
through a military man, can.
Generals Van Fleet and Clark are very able men.
Kut Ike had climbed to a higher rank while in the
army and thereby has had more experience, so his
advice would probably he well worth listening to.
Please don't get the impression that I'm writing
this just because"l am a Republican and therefore
don't like your views. There is much to be said for
both sides, but when one stoops to dragging up
quibbling points and using them for a basis of opinion,
while neglecting other larger considerations, then
the whole affair has gotten out of hand.
