Stanford, got off the hook easily against UCLA. After seeing what the
Bruins did to California Saturday, the Indians 14-24 defeat a few weeks
back is below par for the Bruin course.
Immediately iollowing the Stanford-UCLA game everyone, top brass
included, agreed that UCLA had by far the better ball club. However
Wii'*n the game movies were shown there were many who reversed their
thought and expressed the wish that the tilt could be played over, be
lieving that Stanford mistakes, not Bruin prowess had been the chief
factor in the loss.
We were at Berkeley Saturday. We wanted to see whether UCLA was
as good as we first thought they were, or whether there was something
to tlie talk that if the game was played tomorrow Stanford would take it.
' inclusion: It's good to have the Bruins behind us. A ten point loss to
the Bruins is a moral victory, using a term we hoped had passed with
another era.
We have never spent a more enjoyable afternoon watching California
football. It isn't that we have anything against the Bears that a Big Game
win wouldn't resolve but the manner in which UCLA wiped up Memorial
Stadium with their Big Cousin left little doubt that Stanford did just a
little all.right down south and that the Westwooders are one of the finest
t nis the coast has seen in many a year. In fact some local sports authori
ties already have UCLA beating USC, playing in the Rose Bowl, and
whipping anyone the Big Ten has nerve enough to send out.
And there is justification for such praise. Saturday Paul Cameron
looked better than he did against the Indians and anyone who saw that
game will attest to his greatness. Six-foot-six Ernie Stockert on his catches
reminded one of Bill McColl.
The Bru'n defense was solid. The line gave up nothing, and the backs
u tightly covered possible receivers that Bear quarterbacks were often
forced to run, only to be smeared by alert linebackers and chargers. The
Bruin tackling was sharp and severe. Where one man had to make a
tackle he did and in no uncertain terms. Gang tackling was employed
with great effectiveness. It wasn't rare to see Milt Davis, a Bruin de
fensive back start quickly to stop a Bear play for three yards lost. Don
Moomaw sparkled on defense. In fact the entire defensive Unit was
brilliant. There was only one lapse and that was the t)8 yard kickoff
(turn by Cal's Don Johnson. Without this the Bears would have been
shutout for their second straight week.
What about California? They appeared an entirely different team than
the overwhelming one that we saw whip Missouri. There is little doubt
that key injuries at the tackle spots have hurt the Bears. That is their only
excuse. Their running game apparently is not all it was cracked up to be.
Johnny Olszewski has fumbled four times in the last two games, two setting
up opponent's scores. The Bears seem to have difficulty in getting their
s sual nine men in front of the ball carrier.
California's quarter-backing is very deficient. Handoff's show little
imagination or faking. The passing is atrocious. Three completions in 18
attempts Saturday. Waldorf used three men at the QB spots. None could
spark the offense. However as Pappy said, a quarterback can't just pull
a play and have it work. There must be a team to make a quarterback,
and the Bruins were just not allowing the Bears to be a good team Saturday.
California did show a great weakness in pass defense. UCLA com
pleted 18 of 30 attempts. This could prove disastrous when the Bears
move to Seattle to play Washington Saturday. Heinrich could possibly
bomb the Bears to death. It also should be somewhat of an equalizer
when the Big Game comes around.
All in all it was too much Bruin, and not enough Bear. The Bears are
good but the Bruins the greatest.
