# Spartans, Bronzan Dazed At Unexpected Clobbering
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
The myth was by more than a mile for the Spartans Saturday,
and it was no happy crew of boys that marched into the San Jose
dressing room.
This was supposed to be their big chance, their "once in a life
time" opportunity to beat their mighty neighbors up Palo Alto

I way. Their coacii, Bob Bronzan, re
flected the disappointment of tht
entire team.
In the dressing room, no om
spoke. Bronzan gave each player i
tap when they came in—a tap tha
spoke for itself — "y° u did y° ui
best."
When asked if he thought tha
Stanford was the best team he hac
faced this year, he dodged the issue
He didn't "want to hurt anyone';
feelings." "
As he said ; "Every year we comi
up here and we don't think that it':
going to happen, but it always does
We get into that Stanford Stadiun
and the boys just "seem to l'al
apart."
When asked who he thought stoo:
out for Stanford, he again dodgec
the issue. "Stanford's line play wa
better than it has been in threi
weeks, but it is pretty hard to picl
out individuals in a game like this.
"What do you think of Mathias?
he was asked.
"He's a pretty good boy, but In
had good blocking in front of hin
and didn't do anything for himself.
For his own team, Coach Bronzai
j said that "Bob Amaral, going botl
| ways at end. looked good. Stai
| Wacholz looked good at the othe
j offensive end, as did defensive mei
Jerry Hamilton at right half, Ro;

Hiram at safety, and John Hamber
at middle guard.
"Lynn Aplanalp had a bad day,
but he couldn't have had anything
but a bad day with the blocking
he 'didn't have' in front of him."
With the interview over, Eronzan
went back into the dressing room to
give his boys a little pep talk. After
all, they were "only playing for
fun."
