## 
### LOU PUJALET 
Stanford's Braves opened their season on a sour note Saturday,
dropping a 21-6 decision to the Treasure Island Pirates.
The win gave the 12th Naval District champions their eighth
straight victory of the campaign.
Coach Mai Elward's crew lacked any semblance of power with

the exception of one brief moment
in the final period. They did gather
up enough punch to formulate a
41-yard march only to see it
down on the six-yard stripe.
After 26 minutes of lethargic play
by both teams, the visitors chalked
up their first tally. Wes
Bauder skirted around his own right
end from eight yards out. stumbling
into the end zone for six points.
The play culminated an 8? - yard
drive, covered in 11 plays.
The Pirates scored their second
TD late in the third quarter. With
three minutes to the period, quar
terback Harry Narcisian reared back
on the Stanford 18-yard line and
hit Chuck Mosher on the six-yard
line. Mosher tallied unmolested.
Stanford's JV's struck back in
the final minute of the quarter on
a 57-yard punt return by Bill
Ileilhron. Heilhriin took the punt
on his own 4:1 and ran beautifully
along the east sidelines to pay
dirt. On (he 30 he rammed into
a huddle of Pi-rate tacklers, but
boomed through.
