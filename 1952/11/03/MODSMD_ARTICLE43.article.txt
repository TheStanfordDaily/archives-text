Stanford students expressed
Ihcir opinions on the personali
ties of the two Presidential can
didates as part of a poll just re
leased by the Stanford Commit
tee of Communication.
The poll was primarily designed
to chart student reaction to the can
didates on television as compared
with hearing them on the radio, but
these long-range results will not he
available for several months.
Prepared under the direction of
Ithicl dc Sola Pool, the poll was j
also taken at San Jose State and
San Francisco State. Over 2,500 j
questionnaires were distributed.
On the whole, students feel that
the candidate they are not sup
porting is a good and. sometimes,

an outstanding man. Most avowed
Democrats supported Stevenson
in spite of the party; most Repub
licans were for Eisenhower and
the party.
"This is a normal reaction in such
| ah overwhelmingly Republican
j school," commented Mr. Pool. "The
J Democrats feel on the defensive, the
Republicans on the offensive."
Eisenhower is supported almost
completely by Republicans whose
minds are firmly, set on their
choice. Stevenson, on the other
hand, is hacked by a great pcr
: centage of students who label
themselves aS independents and
| have not yet maue their final
j -decision.
One of the most interesting parts
I of the poll was a personality esti
| mate of the four candidates, Presi
; dential and Vice-Presidential. Stu

dents rated each candidate accord- |
ing to a list of character traits, such |
as brilliant, coarse, Vmd honest.
A casual glance showed that Ei
senhower and Stevenson were \
rated much the same. Opinions
j of both men were high.
On Sen. Nixon's character analy- '■
I sis, however, feelings split sharply. |
| Republicans tended to picture the
! Senator as trustworthy, sincere: !
while Democrats often doubted his
honesty.
Sen. Sparkman drew a "don't
: know" on character by members of
, both parties.
