# Knowland Hits 'Protection'

SAN TRANCISCO, Nov. 2
(UP) â€” Sen. William Knowland
tonight accused President Tru
man of belatedly "trying to pro
tect" Sen. Wayne Morse by de
classifying a top - secret docu
ment seven days after Morse
had spilled its contents to the
world.
Earlier today the California Re
publican demanded an immediate
Justice Department investigation of
Morse's alleged breach of military
security.
The Oregon solon, a lifetime Re
publican, recently jumped to the
bandwagon of Democratic candidate
Adlai Stevenson.
Tonight in Independence, Mo.,
President Truman announced bo
had removed the "top secret" label
from the Forrestal document "in
order that the public may have ac
cess to the facts."
Informed of Mr. Truman's ac
tion, Knowland said the Presi
dent's move obviously was a ma
neuver to "protect Morse from his
violation of the law."
"He (the President) apparently
took the action subsequent to my
wire to the Attorney General de
manding an investigation," Know
land said.
"It shows the administration is
picking out a few selected docu
ments which they feel support
their fatal policy in the Far East,
while at the same time they <irc
suppressing documents which
would give the American people
the entire truth."
"This is nothing unusual," he add
ed. "The administration suppressed
the Wedcmeyftr report on China for
two years and his report on Korea
for three years."
Knowland said it was about time
that a bi-partisan group of Senators
be allowed to examine all records
and documents "rather than having
the President select a few for sup
port of his own case."
