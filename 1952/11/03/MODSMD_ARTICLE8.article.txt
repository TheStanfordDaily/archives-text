## 
### 
An upper - division woman was
found guilty of cheating on a geog
raphy mid-term by the Council for
Student Control last Thursday night,
and was sentenced to two quarters'
suspension.
In a second case, a graduate stu
dent accused of turning in a read
ing report on pages he had not read
was found not guilty by the Coun
cil, which is made up of the Men's
and Women's Council members.
The coed sentenced to suspension
pleaded innocence throughout the
hearing, but was found guilty on the
grounds of direct evidence present
ed against her by three witnesses
who testified they had seen her
looking at her lecture notes after j
receiving the test, and looking on i
another person's paper.
Three other students in the class
were questioned by Council chair
men Joanne Hixson and Ross Pres- !
ley before the formal hearing but :
could not present any conclusive !
evidence in the defendant's behalf, j
The witnesses testifying against j
the girl, when a ked why they had i
not tapped their pencils or spoken
to her when they first observed the
violation, said that it had not oc
curred to them to do - so.
Dick Houghton! chairman of the
Honor Code Committee, sitting in as
adviser on the case, commented that
the hardships of a hearing and pen
alty could possibly be avoided if I
observers of violations would warn
the offender immediately.
The graduate student whom the
Council acquitted had been reported
by a student to whom he had face
tiously commented that he had not
actually read all the pages which he
listed on a psychology reading re
port.
He explained to the Council that
the remark had been a joking one.
and produced notes which he had
taken on the reading.
A reader in the course, subpoe- j
naed to tell whether the notes cor- |
responded to the reading, advi ed i
that they did. He testified that the !
student's previous and present good I
record indicated that he knew flic j
material well.
Presley commented that he should '
be more discriminating in his re- j
marks, and explained that third
person responsibility is vital in the !
Stanford Honor Code system.
