# NATION WILL ELECT PRESIDENT TODAY
## Giant Turnout Is Anticipated 
### HADLEY ROFF Daily Political Editor 
The fury of the political storm that crashed on the nation last
July with the opening of the party conventions in Chicago sub
sided last night when the final thunderclaps of political oratory
were heard.
Last night Governor Adlai Stevenson, speaking from Chicago,

and General Dwiuhl Eisenhower, ►
speaking from Boston;, fired the last ■
volleys of the tumultuous campaign.
Today the nation is quiet, re
strained as thousands of people
march to the polls.
Across the nation, from teem
ing New York to quiet Eos Altos,
the people will exercise their most |
prized right, the right to vote*.
And they are doing so in unprece- |
dented number. It is estimated by
conservative political observers that
by the end of the day, between 53
and 65 million people will have cast
ballots, far surpassing the vote of
49 million cast in 1940.
One of the factors invoking the
laiyje turn-out is the unrestrained
character of the campaign. Nei
ther party has hesitated to smear
the opposition. President Truman,
employing his famous "give 'em
hell" technique, branded many in
the Republican party as "race big
ots." The Republicans, not to be
outdone, called on Senator Joseph
McCarthy who implied that Ste
venson held the endorsement of
the Communist party.
In this atmosphere of charge and
counter-charge, the people listened.
They listened anxiously to Senator
Richard Nixon, the GOP's youthful
Vice-Presidential nominee, when he
defended his $18,000 special fund.
They listened studiously to Ste
venson when he explained how
lie had raised a fund for officials
in his Illinois administration.
And the people listened to the
candidates define the issues and
outline their policies.
The people listened with particu
lar attentiveness when General Ei
senhower promised to go to Korea.
They listened to Stevenson when
he outlined his policies and when i
he slapped important pressure j

groups like the American Legion.
The changing currents of the
campaign have hcen reflected in
the polls taken each week by a
number of research institutes. At
the beginning of the campaign ths
polls showed Eisenhower was rid -
ing on a high crest of popularity,
with more than BO per cent of the
voters championing his election.
Now the crest has fallen, and Ste
venson, according to Gallup and the
California polls, has ridden to a slim
lead.
On Friday, pollsters, testing the
voters' reaction' in California, found

Stanford students for Eisen
hower released' a petition last
week signed by I,Boft undergrad
uates, in reply to the faculty anrl
staff "Columbia petition" released
Oct. 24. The petition cites spe
cifically the issues of foreign pol
icy, Communism, corruption, and
Socialism in commending Eisen
hower's stand.

that Eisenhower's lead had dwin
dled to 46.2 per cent while Steven
son had climbed to 47.9 per cent.
The deciding factor in the election
is the undecided vote, which in Cal
ifornia constitutes 4.4 per ccnt of
the voters. The undecided voters,
the pollsters learned, arc registered
four to one Democratic.
Though Eisenhower has lost
headway, he has still not lost the
election, the pollsters point out.
They say their polls arc subject
to 3 per cent error.
Perhaps the most tellin,g cause
of Ike's falling behind is Demo
cratic argument that Eisenhower
was a captive of the Taft-Jenncr-
McCarthy wing of the GOP.
Eisenhower's pledge to go to Ko
rea, on the other hand, threw the
Democrats on the defensive. The
general, a proven military leader,
promised careful study of the stale
mate in that tragic sector of the
world.
But the sparring is over. The de
cision is now in the hands of the
nation's 50 . million judges — the
people.
