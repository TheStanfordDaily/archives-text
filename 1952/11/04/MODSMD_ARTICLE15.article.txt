# For the Undecided Voter
## The 						Democratic Viewpoint 
### 
Why vote Democratic? We'll answer by try
ing to look into the future.
• Basing our predictions on past records and
campaign activity, we feel reasonably safe in
< xpecting the following trends in the following
areas:
Quality of leadership—The Democrats offer
a brilliant leader, experienced both nationally
and internationally, a man of high principles
who knows how to get them carried out in the
world as it is. The Republican candidate would
be more dependent on his advisers and his
Congress than a man with more political ex
perience. Though Eisenhower's "sell-out" has
undoubtedly been exaggerated, his failure to
stand up for his professed principles leaves
little hope that after his election he could throw
off the influence of men like McCarthy, Taft,
Jenner, and Cain—the whole isolationist, re
actionary element of the Republican party.
Corruption—Stevenson could be expected
to continue his already outstanding record ot
replacing dishonest government employees
v/ith honest, capable men from both parties.
Eisenhower, on the other hand, would have
a hard time controlling the pork-starved He
publicans.
Tax cuts — Stevenson has shown that he
knows how to cut down on waste in govern
ment, but at the same time, one can feel assured
that he will not make dangerous cuts into our
defense program or our spending for the na
tional good. Eisenhower has promised drastic
tax cuts. Where would he make them? We
know that Taft has long fought for lowering de
fense spending. We wonder how influentiahhe
would be.
Labor—Stevenson favors a new labor law
which v/ould egualize the balance o/ power
between labor and management more effec
tively than the present Taft-Hartley law. The
forces which back Eisenhower want stronger
labor legislation, and if they were to have
their way, restrictive laws would be enacted.
Civil Rights—lt seems safe to say that Fair
Employment Practices Commission legislation

is more likely to be passed under a Democratic
administration. The Democratic platform
openly favors FEPC, and such opponents as
Byrnes, Shivers, and Kennon have left the
Stevenson camp. The Republicans tend to
argue that you can't legislate against prejudice,
which is much like saying you can't legislate
against murder. The Republican platform ig
nores civil rights, and the influential Senators
Nixon and Taft have both voted against FEPC
in Congress.
Freedom of expression—While promising
a continued fight against those who are at
tempting to overthrow the government by
force, Stevenson has openly opposed irre
sponsible fear campaigns. It is reasonable to
assume that loyalty-oath-type legislation will
not be sanctioned by a Democratic Congress.
On the other hand, the nation's legislators
would probably interpret the election of a
Republican Congress as a mandate from the
people to enact strongly restrictive legisla
tion against all opposition to the status quo.
McCarthyism would receive an official stamp
of approval.
Foreign policy — Stevenson stands on the
internationalist record of the Democratic party.
He promises the American people no miracles,
only a continuation of realistic and intelligent
efforts toward peace. While Eisenhower has
freely criticized the present foreign policy, he
has yet to suggest any concrete changes. He
implies that his administration would find a
quick way to bring peace, but he does not tell
us how. And we strongly fear the influence of
men like Taft, who voted against the Marshall
Plan, Mutual Security, and Point 4, among other
things.
And so the sides line up. We do not pretend
1 that the Democrats are white, their opponents
black. But we do feel our country will be in
more capable hands and our outlook for the
future brighter with Adlai Stevenson as Presi
dent supported by a Democratic Congress.—

has yet to suggest any concrete changes. He
implies that his administration would find a
quick way to bring peace, but he does not tell
us how. And we strongly fear the influence of
men like Taft, who voted against the Marshall
Plan, Mutual Security, and Point 4, among other
things.
And so the sides line up. We do not pretend

black. But we do feel our country will be in
more capable hands and our outlook for the
future brighter with Adlai Stevenson as Presi

Why vote Democratic? We'll answer by try
ing to look into the future.
• Basing our predictions on past records and
campaign activity, we feel reasonably safe in
< xpecting the following trends in the following
areas:
Quality of leadership—The Democrats offer
a brilliant leader, experienced both nationally
and internationally, a man of high principles
who knows how to get them carried out in the
world as it is. The Republican candidate would
be more dependent on his advisers and his
Congress than a man with more political ex
perience. Though Eisenhower's "sell-out" has
undoubtedly been exaggerated, his failure to
stand up for his professed principles leaves
little hope that after his election he could throw
off the influence of men like McCarthy, Taft,
Jenner, and Cain—the whole isolationist, re
actionary element of the Republican party.
Corruption—Stevenson could be expected
to continue his already outstanding record ot
replacing dishonest government employees
v/ith honest, capable men from both parties.
Eisenhower, on the other hand, would have
a hard time controlling the pork-starved He
publicans.
Tax cuts — Stevenson has shown that he
knows how to cut down on waste in govern
ment, but at the same time, one can feel assured
that he will not make dangerous cuts into our
defense program or our spending for the na
tional good. Eisenhower has promised drastic
tax cuts. Where would he make them? We
know that Taft has long fought for lowering de
fense spending. We wonder how influentiahhe
would be.
Labor—Stevenson favors a new labor law
which v/ould egualize the balance o/ power
between labor and management more effec
tively than the present Taft-Hartley law. The
forces which back Eisenhower want stronger
labor legislation, and if they were to have
their way, restrictive laws would be enacted.
Civil Rights—lt seems safe to say that Fair
Employment Practices Commission legislation

is more likely to be passed under a Democratic
administration. The Democratic platform
openly favors FEPC, and such opponents as
Byrnes, Shivers, and Kennon have left the
Stevenson camp. The Republicans tend to
argue that you can't legislate against prejudice,
which is much like saying you can't legislate
against murder. The Republican platform ig
nores civil rights, and the influential Senators
Nixon and Taft have both voted against FEPC
in Congress.
Freedom of expression—While promising
a continued fight against those who are at
tempting to overthrow the government by
force, Stevenson has openly opposed irre
sponsible fear campaigns. It is reasonable to
assume that loyalty-oath-type legislation will
not be sanctioned by a Democratic Congress.
On the other hand, the nation's legislators
would probably interpret the election of a
Republican Congress as a mandate from the
people to enact strongly restrictive legisla
tion against all opposition to the status quo.
McCarthyism would receive an official stamp
of approval.
Foreign policy — Stevenson stands on the
internationalist record of the Democratic party.
He promises the American people no miracles,
only a continuation of realistic and intelligent
efforts toward peace. While Eisenhower has
freely criticized the present foreign policy, he
has yet to suggest any concrete changes. He
implies that his administration would find a
quick way to bring peace, but he does not tell
us how. And we strongly fear the influence of
