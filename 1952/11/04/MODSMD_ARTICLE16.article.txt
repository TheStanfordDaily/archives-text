# The
						Republican Viewpoint

Today, the performers of the political circus
sit back and let the audience act. Today the
hoopla and folderOl of the past ten weeks is
marked "fini." The final judgment in affairs po
litical—the audience response—is determined.
But as the voters go to the polls, for those
very few undecided voters, we would mention
a few thoughts passing.
On the presidential candidates—both are
outstanding men. Throughout the campaign
they have shown their integrity. Both have
made mistakes, both have been severely
criticized from one guarter or another. But
both are extremely well qualified for the
presidency.
On the Truman administration—while there
have been many outstanding achievements, the
current world situation indicates an inadequacy
i:i Washington. A continued lack of concrete
policy toward Asia, a seeming condonement
of corruption in government, an over-extension
of administrative powers, the ever-lasting stale
mate in Korea—these factors all indicate that
it's time for a change.
Is a change in party leadership enough?—ln
both parties this is a sore point. Can a new
leader with the same party in power make the
needed change? Stevenson cleaned out cor
ruption in Illinois with a change flf party; can
he do the same in Washington as effectively as
it needs to be done, without a change in party?
Can Eisenhower forge through the policies he
iuvors when at the same time he has endorsed
many candidates of the same party who oppose
his views?
Is it wrong for a party leader to give complete
endorsement to his party's slate?— Was Eisen
hower wrong in supporting McCarthy or Jenner
as Republicans, while he disputed their views?
When he has indicated in his campaign that he
has not sacrificed any of his ideals, was he

wrong in recognizing these men as fellow Re
publicans? What about Franklin Roosevelt
when in 1932 he publicly and physically em
braced Huey Long and the infamous Senator
Bilbo?
These are but facets of a complex campaign.
Your feelings in the final analysis are subject
to many biases—your parents', your friends', as
well as your own standards, your own philos
ophy.
We have supported Dwight Eisenhower—
not because we believe he is the cure-all or
because he is a panacea. Rather we iirmly be
lieve he has taken a realistic attitude in the
campaign, and his feelings have mirrored
ours. We cannot say that he is right and
Stevenson is wrong, because we don't believe
that. We recognize that a good number of
admire favor the Democratic can
didate; but our reasoning has led us to back
Eisenhower and the Republican party.
For those undecided voters who are truly in
terested in the decision they will make at the
polls today, we would recommend three articles
which present our feelings in an effective man-"
ner: ,
The non-partisan editorial in the Christian
Science Monitor of Oct. 9. The New York
Times editorial restatement supporting Eisen
hower and their reasons for doing so, Oct. 23.
Eisenhowers' stand on the important issues of
the campaign, TIME magazine, Nov. 3, pages
25-27.
If you disagree with the statements made in
these articles, then we recommend you vote
for Adlai Stevenson. If you find, however, that
these statements make sense, as we believe
they do, and that you agree with them, then we
urge,you to cast your ballot for Dwight Eisen
hower.—Walt Menninger
