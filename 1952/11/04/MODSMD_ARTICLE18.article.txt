## From Another Viewpoint 
### WALLACE STEGNER 
(Editor's note: A professor of English, Dr. Steg
ner is in charge of the Stanford Creative Writing
Institute. He has won a nation-wide reputation as
both a teacher and a writer in his own right.).
Education, we all believe, is a good. Our schools
are our proudest cultural possession. Teachers should
be treated with some respect and given their title of
Doctor if they deserve it. But the respect is only
superficial; it is fair to smile or sneer at the dreamers
and droners; if professors venture into public life
we may raise a temperature about braintrusters; if
they hazard a political opinion we may clamor for
them to get back into their kennels.
Since I am only half a professor, perhaps I can
demur. Not only much of the political change of the

past twenty years, but much of
the organized resistance against
it, has stemmed from the univer
sities and been the product of
professorial brains. The medical
discoveries that the unthinking
credit to "medical science" are
more often than not the product
of the teachers and research
workers of the medical schoojs—
of schoolteacher doctors.
A good many of our best

critics are in the universities. The universities, in
collaboration with the little theaters', keep alive
what little we have left of the serious stage. Out
of the universities come most of our technical and
a lot of our general magazines, and many of our
most serious books. In university laboratories, with
the aid of government and industrial funds, a very
large part of our most fruitful research goes on.
It was university brains that pioneered atomic fis
sion and continue to extend its possibilities.

A man who sneers at teachers as a class should
be known for what he really is: one who hates and
fears intelligence. 1 am tired of the '"practical"
people who think it their privilege to hang around
the fringes of the academic herds and pick off strag
glers, simply because the academic profession is re
luctant to use its weapons of defense.
Teachers are a middle class group with some
middle class weaknesses and most of the middle class
virtues. They cannot be attacked, except in rare
instances, for their divorce rate, their addiction to
drunkenness or violence, or their neglect of their
children. They work for less pay than any other
learned profession, though their work is as impor
tant as any Americans do. Yet their good behavior
is thought weakness, their open-mindedness is some
times called disloyalty, and their brains are called
impractical.
No brains are impractical, open-mindedness is
not disloyalty, good behavior is not weakness.
What teaehers lack, as a profession, is ruthless
ness. I think no professors have started any wars,
though they have helped make the peace. It was
not professors who gutted some of our resources
and made eyesores of our cities. You have not
seen many teachers in lynching mobs or on the
bandwagons of the demagogues. And 1 would bet
the loyalty of the teaching profession against that
of any comparable group.
More than that, I would trust its openness of mind.
Only the frenzy of our time lets us even for a mo
ment confuse" open-mindedness with disloyalty, or
make the other mistake which says that the open
minded man can never He can take a side,
any side, but he hopes to take sides for valid reasons,
not for fear of consequences. The open mind has few
playgrounds any more. The best of the few is the
the universities.

middle class weaknesses and most of the middle class
virtues. They cannot be attacked, except in rare
instances, for their divorce rate, their addiction to
drunkenness or violence, or their neglect of their
children. They work for less pay than any other
learned profession, though their work is as impor
tant as any Americans do. Yet their good behavior
is thought weakness, their open-mindedness is some
times called disloyalty, and their brains are called
impractical.
No brains are impractical, open-mindedness is
not disloyalty, good behavior is not weakness.
What teaehers lack, as a profession, is ruthless
ness. I think no professors have started any wars,
though they have helped make the peace. It was
not professors who gutted some of our resources
and made eyesores of our cities. You have not
seen many teachers in lynching mobs or on the
bandwagons of the demagogues. And 1 would bet
the loyalty of the teaching profession against that
of any comparable group.
More than that, I would trust its openness of mind.
Only the frenzy of our time lets us even for a mo
ment confuse" open-mindedness with disloyalty, or
make the other mistake which says that the open
minded man can never He can take a side,
any side, but he hopes to take sides for valid reasons,
not for fear of consequences. The open mind has few
playgrounds any more. The best of the few is the
the universities.

Education, we all believe, is a good. Our schools
are our proudest cultural possession. Teachers should
be treated with some respect and given their title of
Doctor if they deserve it. But the respect is only
superficial; it is fair to smile or sneer at the dreamers
and droners; if professors venture into public life
we may raise a temperature about braintrusters; if
they hazard a political opinion we may clamor for
them to get back into their kennels.
Since I am only half a professor, perhaps I can
demur. Not only much of the political change of the

past twenty years, but much of
the organized resistance against
it, has stemmed from the univer
sities and been the product of
professorial brains. The medical
discoveries that the unthinking
credit to "medical science" are
more often than not the product
of the teachers and research
workers of the medical schoojs—
of schoolteacher doctors.
A good many of our best

critics are in the universities. The universities, in
collaboration with the little theaters', keep alive
what little we have left of the serious stage. Out
of the universities come most of our technical and
a lot of our general magazines, and many of our
most serious books. In university laboratories, with
the aid of government and industrial funds, a very
large part of our most fruitful research goes on.
It was university brains that pioneered atomic fis
sion and continue to extend its possibilities.

A man who sneers at teachers as a class should
be known for what he really is: one who hates and
fears intelligence. 1 am tired of the '"practical"
people who think it their privilege to hang around
the fringes of the academic herds and pick off strag
glers, simply because the academic profession is re
luctant to use its weapons of defense.
