# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
I stand firmly opposed to advertising. As far as I
am concerned, the syrup-voiced announcer who lauds
Duz. Arrid, and Burgermeister should suffer the same
fate that Cal did last weekend.
However, for this one particular morning I must eat
my conviction and give a plug to a meritorious prod
uct that has wandered across my attention.
The name of this product is "Great Moments in

Stanford Sports," and as one ob
server recently said, "It is as in
dispensable to the Stanford book
shelf as the Quad."
The book is 120 pages long, has
16 pages of pictures, and five pages
of statistics.
Many attempts have been made
at a book on Stanford sports, but
this is the first one to reach com
pletion. There is little doubt that
the Farm has contributed more

great napies to sports than any other university in
the world. Look at names like Hank Luisetti, the
greatest basketball player ever to step on the hard
wood; Ernie Nevers, the third greatest football player
of all time, behind Red Grange and Jim Thorpe; and
Bob Mathias, presently the world's most perfect ath
lete.
Then there's Frankie Albert, of whom all other
T formation quarterbacks are copies; Bill McColl,
230 pounds of AU-American greatness; Chuck Tay
lor. Coach of the Year; and Pop Warner, Coach of
All Years. And don't forget names like Eddie

Tucker and George (The Bird) Yardley in bas
ketball. <*â– 
An outstanding group of authors has contributed
to this book. For example, Herbert Hoover, who was
a manager on the Stanford football team before he
became President of the United States, wrote about
the first Big Game in 1892. Twenty thousand were
there, and everything was fine, except someone for
got to bring the football.
Other authors include the Chronicle's Bill Leiser,
past president of the Football Writers of America;
Dick Friendlich and Art Rtftenbaum of the Chron
icle; Dink Templeton, America's most astute track
mind; Chuck Taylor, Frankie Albert, and Bobby
Grayson. Then there's John Hall, the best humor
writer The Daily ever produced; and Rube Samuel
sen, who is one of America's most prolific and tal
ented journalists. Two men intimately acquainted
with the Stanford athletic picture, Palo Alto Times
Sports Editor Walt Gamage and Athletic News Di
rector Don Liebendorfer, made valuable contribu
tions to the book.
The best part of the book is the price. It sells in
bookstores for $2.50, but there is a limited number
of copies of a student edition on sole for $1.50. They
will be vended on the four corners of the Quad
Thursday only.
Best yet, many of the copies will be autographed
by Frankie Albert, Bob Mathias, Chuck Taylor, Ev
erett Dean, and Dink Templeton.
There, I've done it. I went and advertised some
thing. I'm sorry.
