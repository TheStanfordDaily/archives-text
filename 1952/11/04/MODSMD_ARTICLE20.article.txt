SKIPPING ALONG —Skip Crist goes for yardage against a weak
San Jose State line. Spartan Ed Salvadalena is shown bringing
down Crist after a four yard pickup. Stanford's running attack
Inked better than ever last week, but how it will fare against
ÜbC's nation's-best line next week remains to be seen.
