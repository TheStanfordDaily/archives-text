# Conference Gridders Roll to Easy Wins
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
Form held up surprisingly well in the Pacific Coast Conference
last Saturday as all the favored elevens won their games. Usually,
the first weekend in November is sprinkled with one or two upsets.
We are not classifying the UCLA win over California as an
upset, although the margin of victory might have been a surprise.

j There was no really pronounced fa
| vorite in that contest, and had Cal
t come eUt on top, no eyebrows would
j have raised.
Stanford's future opponents had a
pretty rough time ol' it. as the Ore
gon Ducks were also %?aten. USC
did not play, but since the Bears
were trampled, it gave the future
foes an 0-2 mark.
All told for the season, the In
dian grid opponents still save a win
ning mark with 35 wins, 27 losses,
| and 2 ties.
Now for a rundown of the high
lights of Saturday's games which
involved PCC teams:
UCLA 28, California 7—Paul Cam
eron and end Ike Jones again paced
the Bruins' offense, as the Bruin
tailback passed for two touchdowns
while a sturdy defensive line kept
the Eears bottled throughout the
game. Don Johnson accounted for
the only Cal score In two weeks
when he ran back a kickoff 98 yards.
Huskies Win Again
Washington 38, Oregon State 13—
Another familiar name, Don Hein
rich, was the difference here as the
Huskies continued to roll. The Arm
| passed for three touchdowns and
completed 19 out of 37 passes for
165 yards. Meanwhile, the resur
gent Washington ground offense
rolled up 227 yards.
COP 14, Oregon 6—The running
of Tom McCormick and the passing
of Jerry Ottoson stood out as the
! Tigers downed the Ducks on a rain
soaked field. McCormick scored
both COP touchdowns, and Ottoson
completed 15 out of 21 aerials.
Cougars Triumph
Washington State 36, Idaho 6 —
WSC finally lived up to its pre-sea
son press clippings as they smashed
the Vandals in the Northwest's tra
ditional "nine-mile feud." Quarter
back Bob Burkhart passed for three
scores, and for 407 net yards,
to star for the Cougars.
This Week's Games
Palo Alto will have all eyes fo
cused upon it this Saturday when
the Indians meet the unbeaten Tro
jans in the PCC Game of the Week.
In another top game, Cal will at
tempt to get back on the win trail
when they meet Washington at Se
! attle.

UCLA gets a breather in Oregon
State in Los Angeles, while Oregon
journeys to Pullman to play Wash
ington State.
