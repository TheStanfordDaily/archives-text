BALLSO' FIRE—Jack Campbell, freshman, demonstrates a trick
sweeping eastern college campuses. He fills his mouth with
lighter fluid and then spits it in a fine spray toward a lighted
match. The results are as spectacular as they are dangerous and
are not recommended for anyone other than experts or freshmen.
Necessary accessories for the trick are fire extinguishers and
burn ointment. —Daily photo by Glenn Erickson
