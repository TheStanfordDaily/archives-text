# Pass That Peace Pact
## 
### 
The treat / has been signed it's up to us to
ratify it.
In this caso, it's the Stanford-California Big
Game F<ict, signed recently by student body
pr<-.'sMfaults Dick Holler and Dick Weisrnann,
.ml DoanS ol Students H. E. Stone and H. Don
.ltd Wmbigler.
Since the and of the war, the non-aggression
pud has aimed at avoiding "any occurrence
that might endanger the friendly relations that
have existed between our universities for so
many years," and to "maintain the fine sports
manship that has been the tradition of our 'Big
Game'." Creating such a pact was prompted
by j;ie war A_xe stealings and campus-paintings
wluc.h resulted in breaking off relations be
twef.n Gal and Stanford.
In our opinion, the pact became especially
meaningful two years ago when 15 Stanford
fie::hmen found out the hard way what the
agree ment stood for. Pleading ignorance of the
j.art, Iherje freshmen agreed to indoctrinate the

next frosh class, so their mistake would not be
repeated.
Last year this "preventative" plan oper
ated to channel more constructive "Bicj Game
fever" and to avoid damaqe either to prop
erty or to individuals. This tradition will be
further strengthened next week, when the
class of '56 is instructed in the pact's respon
sibilities, already assumed by the rest of the
student body.
What are these responsibilities? The agree
ment states "there shall be no 'raids' by the
students of either university on the campus of
the other, and that students participating in
such violations will be subject to severe disci
pline." The term "raid" includes dropping leaf-
Jets on the campuses from aircraft.
We feel that the Big Game Pact is realisti
cally designed to prevent the retaliatory raid
ing system. Let's beat Cal on the football field,
not on the Campanile. Mary Mas.se/
