only difference between the

iitMHii uiai early clans litis morning ami go on out to
KosotLi's. There is no place like Rosotti's to settle
Mini- breakfast; even when it's closed as it is in the
morning. If you thought this suggestion was ridicu

mornings. (Opens at 12 nooli, sharp).

You are a blockhead.
Samuel Johnson once said, "No man hut a block
-1 >• id ever wrote except for money."
Therefore, I am a blockhead, and you are the biggest
damn blockhead I ever heard of to read what a block
head writes.
You stupid blockhead.

fi is ii favorite trick of newspaper columnists to

spin out a whole column of relating in ;i quasi-humor
•'us manner how difficult it is to think of things to
write about.
1 have similar difficulties, hut at this hour in the i
morning I shall not harrass you poor people prop- J
ing your eyes open and eagerly assimilating tin- life- |
giving properties of caffeine.
I shall, instead, do as my colleague, Sam Freshman, !
and write on one of my colleagues, viz., Sam Fresh- J
man. 1 was, of course, flattered a few days back when j
he ridiculed one of my columns. It shows that some- I
body besides me reads this trash.
He was obviously trying to think of something to J
write about and so created a few lines of type out of j
me.
It has not been my pleasure to meet Mr. Freshman.
When I saw his first column, I assumed Sain Fresh
man was a nom de plume to lure freshman readers. |
I do not yet know if .such a person really exists. He
writes a fine column and also has a picture printed |
which is almost as hilarious as mine. The other day I j
received a letter from my mother who subscribes to j
the Daily, i.e., the mother that subscribes to the Daily. :
It ran as follows:
"What is this Sam Freshman character like? From :
his picture he looks mighty unappetizing and I w;is
amused by what the guy himself said about the gal
who wrote that if he looked like his picture he'd prob- I
ably never even met a gal."
My picture indicates one of two things: (1)1 also
have never met a gal, or (2) I have met many too
many. Just look at that expression. However, if you i
have ever had the misfortune of meeting me, you will I
find that in real life I have the sort of face that, once [
seen, is never remembered.
Well, Sam Freshnianotias by now been exhausted
as a subject for this Bull Session so you can gulp
down that colfee. light up, and scurry off to class
