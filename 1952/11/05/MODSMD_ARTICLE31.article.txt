### PETE GROTHE 
I here are at least six people in the United States who couldn't afford to
takt much time put to listen to the election returns last night. And their
names, are Taylor, Fehring, Lynn, Ruetz, Kmetovic, and Elwurd. They
comprise the Stanford coaching staff and they have a lull time job in pre
paring lor the Indians' opponent this weekend. Chuck Taylor complained,
I "wish we had time to listen to all the election returns, but there is ju.lt
too much work to be done."
Unless you ve just blown in l'rom the North Pole, you know that Stan-

ford meets Southern Cal in a game of football
this Saturday.
Farm supporters are hoping that it will be
a repeat of last year's triumph. Any Stanford
rooter who sat in the smog-filled Coliseum
last year to see an unbeaten Stanford squad
whip an also unblemished Trojan outfit, 27 to
20, wil testify that that was the greatest game
of all time. Defeat seemed certain, and yet a
team that wouldn't be denied scored two touch
downs in the last nine minutes to beat USC,
ol which there is none more despised.
To twist a saying, Southern Cal displayed
an amazing talent to clutch defeat out of the
hands of victory.
You can bet your last button that the

hated I rojans will be carrying the memory of that shattering defeat on the
floor of Stanford's big brown bowl this Saturday. The '51 game will provide
excellent source material for a dressing room talk by Coach Jess Hill.
Although the Trojans' motive is revenge and a clear shot at the Rose
Bowl, Stanford is no less inspired. Stanford can't go to {he Rose Bowl, and
it can t win the PCC, but nothing would give the Indians more sadistic
pleasure than playing the role of "spoilers." The very thought makes the
gridders drool.
All ot which brings us to the question of how the Trojans can be beaten.
The answer lies in the strong right arm of Bob Garrett. If Stanford tries to
run against USC's rock-ribbed wall, they might as well concede defeat right
iiOw. But if Garrett passed himsell dizzy, just like Kerkorian did last year,
then victory can be Stanford's. The Trojans have allowed their opponents
an average of three-and-a-half points a game, but they have not yet met
a passer of Garrett's calibre. If Garrett is "hot," and Stanford's pass pro
tection is at its very best, then the Trojans can be had.
We. an- predicting that the Trojans will be had. Carry on, Bob.

It's the Same McColl
A dark jersey had been substituted for the red one, and he wore the
number "83" instead of "3," but it was the same Bill McColl. He plays for the
Chicago Bears now, not the Stanford Indians, but he's still the loose-limbed
catching giant that he was last year. The Bear system of attack doesn't
take lull advantage ot McColl's talents. Halas uses his halfbacks as the
main pass-receivers and usualy has his ends block. However, Bear quarter
backs are beginning to throw more to the ends, and Bill set up the first
touchdown with a beautiful over-the-head catch.
Indicentally, McColl bought $150 worth of tickets to eive away to his
friends. He gave six tickets to Dr. Sterling and six to Mr. Balch. That's the
kind of a guy he is. He never forgets a friend. There'll never be another
Jikr Bill McColl, and the sooner we retire his number "3" the better.

"I'll Buy Ten"
One person took a look at the advance copy of "Great Moments in Stan
ford Sports and said. "I'll buy ten. They'll make good Christmas presents."
Besides many of the country's top sport names who contributed to this
book, several members of the Daily Sports staff, present and past, helped
out on the book. Larry Cahn, chief rooster in the sports dept., did a hangup
job. and John Breier, Mike Hudson, Art Abrahamson, John Herbold. Bob
Batlin, Dick Klein, Bob Bernstein, and Jim Madison also added their talents.
The books, which go on sale for the students Thursday only, will be
autographed by Chuck Taylor, Bob Mathias, Frankie Albert. Everett Dean,
and Dink Templeton. The first 400 buyers will get autographed copies. '
