Coach Elward's Braves are
busily prepplng the varsity lor Sat
urday's USC crucla», as we " as
readying themselves fo> a £ urnt?
Friday afternoon.
The Braves meet Alameda JJvO
at 2 p.m. on the Flyers' home field.
Jack Dawson, first-string half
back, was declared out for the
season yesterday due to an in
jury incurred in Saturday's Treas
ure Island fray. Dawson, a sen
ior. wrenched his knee in the first i
quarter.
Dawson's loss may considerably j
weaken the JV's offensive game, as
he was expected to carry the bur
den of the Braves' ground game this
season.
Elward announced that Bill Heil
brun, who scored Stanford's only
touchdown Saturday, will replace
Dawson at the right half spot.
iVlike Anderson will be switched
to fullback this week, after his
impressive, bard running from the
left half position against TI.
Filling the vacant left half spot
will be Doug Collins, who displayed
a steady game against the' Pirates.
Elward was quite satisfied with
the showing made by his boys, con
sidering the little time they have
had to practice. The Braves' big
job each week is to run enemy of-

I fensive patterns against the var- j
sity, leaving them little time to j
i learn their own assignments.
