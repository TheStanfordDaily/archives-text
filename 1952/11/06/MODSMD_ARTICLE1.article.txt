# Desire for Change Chief Reason for Eisenhower Victory Surge
## 
### HADLEY ROFF Daily Political Editor 
It was a lidal wave!
It swept through all parts of the nation—from the :;taid Northeast
and Ihe dissatisfied South to the Growing West.
And it marks one of the most dramatic political upheavals of the
century. That the Republicans could win was acknowledged by most
political observers. But, they cautioned, if the GOP did triumph it would
do so by a slim margin.
They said the Republicans would ride to office on the last ripple of
Dwight Eisenhower's once great crest of popularity.
Hut it was no ripple that carried the battling general to the White
House, it was a massive wave of support.
It's driving force was made up of several elements, chief among
which was the burning desire for change.
The people wanted to be unburdened from the pressing problems of
the times. For seven years they had been hearing of the Russian threat,
for two and a half years they had been reading the casualty reports

.•.temming from Korea. They had been hearing much of corruption and
communism in government—and they were fed up.
Communism became particularly significant. That the people arc
much distressed ahout reports of Communism in government is evi
denced in the thumping victory of Senator Joseph McCarthy this
year both in the primary and in the general election.
Further cvidcnce comes from California, where harsh political war
was waged over two state Constitutional amendments, Propositions five
and six, both aimed at possible subversion. Both were approved by wide
margins. Proposition five, which bars subversives from state jobs, was
passed by a two to one margin. Vote was YES 1,382,284 —NO 649,544.
Proposition six, establishing a loyalty oath for all public officials, also
was swamped into office. Vote was YES 1,382,284—-NO (507,211. (The
figures are of late ygsterday afternoon.)
McCarthy won triumphantly despite charges that he accepted money
from a pressure group and that he tampered with election returns in
Maryland in 19. r )0. The two propositions won despite the opposition of
many California lawyers who pointed out that they were imperfectly
worded and gave no exact definition of the word "subversive."

Thus in two states, widely .separated geographically, the voters
displayed almost over whelming apprehension over the so-called Com
munist threat.
Throughout the nation, the people sought A leader, one familiar with
Communism, one who knew how to inspire confidence, and who could
administer the hard problems of state.
The Republicans suggested Eisenhower. He had led the "Crusade in
Europe." And during the last year and a half has supervised the con
struction of a firm bulwark against Communism in Europe.
His nomination, said leading Republicans, marked the beginning of
a new crusade, a "Crusade for America." During the 14 weeks of cam
paigning, beginning Labor Day, Eisenhower jaunted through all parts
of the country.
But many, hearing the general for the first time, were disappointed.
They said he was avoiding the issues, speaking in generalities.
And the pollsters, with their whiring calculators, began predicting a
shift away from the general.
But the general countered neatly. Two weeks before the fateful Tues
day, he announced dramatically that he would go to Korea on a per

son a I inspection tour. Then last Monday, in an unpretentious but forth
right speech, lie told the nation he was the captive of no group and
pledged he would work sincerely for peace.
ITie press tried to back the Republican hopeful, saying that Eisen
hower's open endorsement of such controversial figures as McCarthy and
Senator William Jennet- of Indiana were mere matters of political neces
sity and reflected no alteration in his thinking.
Eisenhower's popularity swelled.
From the outset Tuesday, it was Eisenhower. From early afternoon
on his lead increased. By 10:4 ft p.m. (P.S.T.) the tide was obvious and
Democrat Adlai Stevenson conceded defeat.
One interesting aspect of the Eisenhower victory is that he did not
lend the Republican party as a whole to victory.
Eisenhower's victory precipitated no flood of Republicans to office.
In the Senate it looks like a 48-48 tie. if Senator Wayne Morse in
chalked in the Democratic column. In the House, as of last night, Repub
licans apparently hold 223 seats opposed to 211 for the Democrats.
It would seem then, that Eisenhower's victory was a personal one,
based on his personality characteristics rather than his political ideologies.

Throughout the nation, the people sought A leader, one familiar with
Communism, one who knew how to inspire confidence, and who could
administer the hard problems of state.
The Republicans suggested Eisenhower. He had led the "Crusade in
Europe." And during the last year and a half has supervised the con
struction of a firm bulwark against Communism in Europe.
His nomination, said leading Republicans, marked the beginning of
a new crusade, a "Crusade for America." During the 14 weeks of cam
paigning, beginning Labor Day, Eisenhower jaunted through all parts
of the country.
But many, hearing the general for the first time, were disappointed.
They said he was avoiding the issues, speaking in generalities.
And the pollsters, with their whiring calculators, began predicting a
shift away from the general.
But the general countered neatly. Two weeks before the fateful Tues
day, he announced dramatically that he would go to Korea on a per

son a I inspection tour. Then last Monday, in an unpretentious but forth
right speech, lie told the nation he was the captive of no group and
pledged he would work sincerely for peace.
ITie press tried to back the Republican hopeful, saying that Eisen
hower's open endorsement of such controversial figures as McCarthy and
Senator William Jennet- of Indiana were mere matters of political neces
sity and reflected no alteration in his thinking.
Eisenhower's popularity swelled.
From the outset Tuesday, it was Eisenhower. From early afternoon
on his lead increased. By 10:4 ft p.m. (P.S.T.) the tide was obvious and
Democrat Adlai Stevenson conceded defeat.
One interesting aspect of the Eisenhower victory is that he did not
lend the Republican party as a whole to victory.
Eisenhower's victory precipitated no flood of Republicans to office.
In the Senate it looks like a 48-48 tie. if Senator Wayne Morse in
chalked in the Democratic column. In the House, as of last night, Repub
licans apparently hold 223 seats opposed to 211 for the Democrats.
It would seem then, that Eisenhower's victory was a personal one,
based on his personality characteristics rather than his political ideologies.
It was a lidal wave!
It swept through all parts of the nation—from the :;taid Northeast
and Ihe dissatisfied South to the Growing West.
And it marks one of the most dramatic political upheavals of the
century. That the Republicans could win was acknowledged by most
political observers. But, they cautioned, if the GOP did triumph it would
do so by a slim margin.
They said the Republicans would ride to office on the last ripple of
Dwight Eisenhower's once great crest of popularity.
Hut it was no ripple that carried the battling general to the White
House, it was a massive wave of support.
It's driving force was made up of several elements, chief among
which was the burning desire for change.
The people wanted to be unburdened from the pressing problems of
the times. For seven years they had been hearing of the Russian threat,
for two and a half years they had been reading the casualty reports

.•.temming from Korea. They had been hearing much of corruption and
communism in government—and they were fed up.
Communism became particularly significant. That the people arc
much distressed ahout reports of Communism in government is evi
denced in the thumping victory of Senator Joseph McCarthy this
year both in the primary and in the general election.
Further cvidcnce comes from California, where harsh political war
was waged over two state Constitutional amendments, Propositions five
and six, both aimed at possible subversion. Both were approved by wide
margins. Proposition five, which bars subversives from state jobs, was
passed by a two to one margin. Vote was YES 1,382,284 —NO 649,544.
Proposition six, establishing a loyalty oath for all public officials, also
was swamped into office. Vote was YES 1,382,284—-NO (507,211. (The
figures are of late ygsterday afternoon.)
McCarthy won triumphantly despite charges that he accepted money
from a pressure group and that he tampered with election returns in
Maryland in 19. r )0. The two propositions won despite the opposition of
many California lawyers who pointed out that they were imperfectly
worded and gave no exact definition of the word "subversive."

Thus in two states, widely .separated geographically, the voters
displayed almost over whelming apprehension over the so-called Com
munist threat.

century. That the Republicans could win was acknowledged by most
political observers. But, they cautioned, if the GOP did triumph it would
do so by a slim margin.
They said the Republicans would ride to office on the last ripple of
Dwight Eisenhower's once great crest of popularity.
Hut it was no ripple that carried the battling general to the White
House, it was a massive wave of support.
It's driving force was made up of several elements, chief among
which was the burning desire for change.
The people wanted to be unburdened from the pressing problems of
the times. For seven years they had been hearing of the Russian threat,
for two and a half years they had been reading the casualty reports

.•.temming from Korea. They had been hearing much of corruption and
communism in government—and they were fed up.
Communism became particularly significant. That the people arc
much distressed ahout reports of Communism in government is evi
denced in the thumping victory of Senator Joseph McCarthy this
year both in the primary and in the general election.
Further cvidcnce comes from California, where harsh political war
was waged over two state Constitutional amendments, Propositions five
and six, both aimed at possible subversion. Both were approved by wide
margins. Proposition five, which bars subversives from state jobs, was
passed by a two to one margin. Vote was YES 1,382,284 —NO 649,544.
Proposition six, establishing a loyalty oath for all public officials, also
was swamped into office. Vote was YES 1,382,284—-NO (507,211. (The
figures are of late ygsterday afternoon.)
McCarthy won triumphantly despite charges that he accepted money
from a pressure group and that he tampered with election returns in
Maryland in 19. r )0. The two propositions won despite the opposition of
many California lawyers who pointed out that they were imperfectly
worded and gave no exact definition of the word "subversive."

Thus in two states, widely .separated geographically, the voters
displayed almost over whelming apprehension over the so-called Com
munist threat.
Throughout the nation, the people sought A leader, one familiar with
Communism, one who knew how to inspire confidence, and who could
administer the hard problems of state.
The Republicans suggested Eisenhower. He had led the "Crusade in
Europe." And during the last year and a half has supervised the con
struction of a firm bulwark against Communism in Europe.
His nomination, said leading Republicans, marked the beginning of
a new crusade, a "Crusade for America." During the 14 weeks of cam
paigning, beginning Labor Day, Eisenhower jaunted through all parts
of the country.
But many, hearing the general for the first time, were disappointed.
They said he was avoiding the issues, speaking in generalities.
And the pollsters, with their whiring calculators, began predicting a
shift away from the general.
But the general countered neatly. Two weeks before the fateful Tues
day, he announced dramatically that he would go to Korea on a per

son a I inspection tour. Then last Monday, in an unpretentious but forth
right speech, lie told the nation he was the captive of no group and
pledged he would work sincerely for peace.
ITie press tried to back the Republican hopeful, saying that Eisen
hower's open endorsement of such controversial figures as McCarthy and
Senator William Jennet- of Indiana were mere matters of political neces
sity and reflected no alteration in his thinking.
Eisenhower's popularity swelled.
From the outset Tuesday, it was Eisenhower. From early afternoon
on his lead increased. By 10:4 ft p.m. (P.S.T.) the tide was obvious and
Democrat Adlai Stevenson conceded defeat.
One interesting aspect of the Eisenhower victory is that he did not
lend the Republican party as a whole to victory.
Eisenhower's victory precipitated no flood of Republicans to office.
In the Senate it looks like a 48-48 tie. if Senator Wayne Morse in
chalked in the Democratic column. In the House, as of last night, Repub
licans apparently hold 223 seats opposed to 211 for the Democrats.
It would seem then, that Eisenhower's victory was a personal one,
based on his personality characteristics rather than his political ideologies.
