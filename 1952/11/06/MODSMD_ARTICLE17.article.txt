# Ike Seeks 'Speedy' End to Conflict
## Korean Visit Planned Soon 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 (UP) _
Dwight. D. Eisenhower's record
slide victory today plunged him
into the middle of some of the most
critical foreign policy problems ever
faced by a new American President.
Ready to fly to Korea to seek a
"speedy and honorable" end to the
costly war, he cannot even wait
until he assumes the reins of gov
ernment before unveiling decisions
on how the United States will lead
the free world in its fight against
Communism.
No date was set for Eisenliow™
er's trip to Korea, but aides said
lie probably would go soon after
10 days of golfing, fishing, and
resting at Bobby Jones' cottage
next to the 18th hole of the Au
gusta. Ga., National Golf Coursr.
Eisenhower also has said he will
meet with Soviet Premier Josrl
Stalin if he thinks it would hoij»
him win a "just peacc" for tin;
world.
Other less-dramatic foreign pol •
icy actions will unfold after the for
mer five-star general assumes tha
Presidency Jan. 20.
He has pledged greater empha
sis on Asia, increased trade rela
tions with free nations, a .stepped
up anti - Communist propaganda
program, repudiation of the 1945
Yalta agreement with Russia, and
creation of a new top-level for
eign policy planning board.
Execution of Eisenhower's for
eign policy program possibly will
be placed in the hands of either
Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New-
York or GOP foreign policy expert"
John Foster Dulles. Paul Hoffman
is another possibility for Secretary
of State.
Top priority in the new ad
ministration undoubtedly will bo
given to finding some settlement
of the Korean war. America's
participation probably had murh
to do with the outcome of the
election.
A survey of some 30 Eisenhower
campaign speeches and statement's
coupled with campaign points made
by his foreign policy advisers fore
cast these other foreign poli'-y prin
ciple* and moves by the Ei. enhower
administration:
Objectives —Peace without ap
peasement; weakening of Soviet
control over satellite countries; pre -
venting new Red victories, and
building free world strength lo pre
vent war.
Red China, Formosa—Resource
ful and imaginative effort taking
several years is required to "undo
the disaster" of Red domination of
China. Chinese Nationalist tvoop?
on Formosa should guard the is
land instead of going to Korea to
fight.
Elsewhere in Asia—The United
States will work more closely with
free Asian nations. Defense pacts
on the pattern of the North Atlantic.
Treaty in Western Europe arc re
quired.

Dwight. D. Eisenhower's record
slide victory today plunged him
into the middle of some of the most
critical foreign policy problems ever
faced by a new American President.
Ready to fly to Korea to seek a
"speedy and honorable" end to the
costly war, he cannot even wait
until he assumes the reins of gov

on how the United States will lead
the free world in its fight against
Communism.
No date was set for Eisenliow™
er's trip to Korea, but aides said

10 days of golfing, fishing, and
resting at Bobby Jones' cottage

Eisenhower also has said he will
meet with Soviet Premier Josrl

He has pledged greater empha

program, repudiation of the 1945
Yalta agreement with Russia, and

John Foster Dulles. Paul Hoffman
is another possibility for Secretary

Top priority in the new ad

given to finding some settlement
of the Korean war. America's
participation probably had murh
to do with the outcome of the
election.
A survey of some 30 Eisenhower
campaign speeches and statement's
