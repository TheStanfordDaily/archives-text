Whew!
It's all over.

Colfeetime conversation can return to "Won
der who'll win Saturday?" and "Guess who
just got pinned?"
it was an exciting campaign between two
good men supported by two enthusiastic par
ties. The campaign wa3 extraordinary in the
quality of the candidates; it was very ordinary
in its ups and downs.
During the better moments of the post few
months, many thoughtful things were said,
and much constructive criticism was made.
Then thetre were the downs. Like the ir
responsible charges of race prejudice and
communist sympathy. Like the emotionalism
that painted the issues in unrealistic blacks
and whites.
The Daily's own part in the campaign was a
venture into bi-partisan editorializing. As an.
ASSU publication, we did not feel we could
justly endorse either candidate. But at the same

time we wanted to bring our readers the par
tisan viewpoints which we feel are so impor
tant a part of any political campaign.
Judging from the response, we at least suc
ceeded in stimulating the political interest on
campus. And, incidentally, The Daily wishes to
thank all of you who came to us with your com
ments.
We were cheered to note during the cam
paign that the winds of freedom are still blow
ing at Stanford. Though there was much pub
lic pressure, our right to say what we wanted
was never questioned by any official —either
student or administration.
And so with the election over, The Daily
again becomes editorially united, and you,
the reader, can feel assured that it stands
officially behind its editorial writers. The
practice from now on: editorials by the editor
will be unsigned; those by other Editorial
Board members will be signed.
Now the Stanford Daily joins the rest of the
nation in giving its full support to President
Eisenhower as he works to bring to America
better days in a peaceful world—the goal of
both parties. —Daily Editorial Board
