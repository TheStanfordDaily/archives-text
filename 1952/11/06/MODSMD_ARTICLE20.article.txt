# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
ON ELECTIONS AND STUFF
I submit that there are many happy people on
campus this morning. And that there are many
unhappy ones too. And I would further venture to
say that there is nobody in between.
Tiiis is all the result of the festival of overexertion
that hits the country every four years known as
elections. 4

It was as if the Big Game had
just been played and the winners
and losers were both on campus.
Stanford students greeted the
news, following many pursuits
of endeavor. Frosh men and
women were pieceing together a
float at Encina to the accompani
ment of a triumphant JI. V.
Kaltenborn. When H. V. tenored
that it looked like Ike had things
in the bag, one girl gut so excited

that she (1) screamed, (2) stepped through the wire
mesh on her float, (3) hit someone below the mesh
on the head, (4) heard him scream.
The Daily shack was a contrast in conflicting
emotions* The Daily was split 50-50, with all the
photography staff being Republicans. The excited
photogs ran around the shack, taking pictures of
every glum Democrat they could lind. With flash
bulbs yet.
Even the stagnant air of the reserved book room
was bestirred by the announcement that Eisenhower
was way ahead. Someone told someone, who in turn
told someone else, who in turn informed someone
else. Within three minutes physics, history, and
Fieneh were dead subjects, and the RBK was cleared,
leaving it there to itself to think quiet thoughts.

The move was to Chez Yvonne and Mangini's where
people were dropping off like the ants who taste En
cina food.
The campus had a new conversation piece yes
terday morning. Persons who had been meeting
other persons at the Cellar since the beginning of
the quarter and had never known quite what to
say to each other at least found a temporary solu
tion to their problem. "Gee, it's great that Ike won,
huh?" or "The Republicans will ruin America"
replaced the plastic smiles.
As one walked across the Quad, comments like
the following were common: "I hope that Ike doesn't
get shot in Korea, because if he does, Nixon will
become president and I'll transfer to Oxford Uni
versity." And "I'll bet old Harry is really swearing
now."
One tiling was certain. For the Democrats there
was no solace. To them, a truly great man who had
refused to compromise with his ideals had been
beaten. Something else was certain. Uneontained
Republican joy flowed all over the place. America
had solidly repudiated Trumanism, and elected a
great general.
In a few days, the topic of conversation at (he
Cellar will shift back to "the bees must go" and
about the horrible Cellar coffee. But right now,
it's all politics and there arc a lot of happy and
unhappy people on Quad.
And there is no one in between.

"Great Moments in Stanford Sports," which goes
on sale , today, had been getting excellent reviews in
San Francisco and Peninsula newspapers. The first
475 people to buy copies will get books autographed
by Bob Mathias, Chuck Taylor, Frankie Albert,
Everett Dean, and Dink Templeton.

Tiiis is all the result of the festival of overexertion
that hits the country every four years known as
elections. 4

It was as if the Big Game had
just been played and the winners
and losers were both on campus.
Stanford students greeted the
news, following many pursuits
of endeavor. Frosh men and
women were pieceing together a
float at Encina to the accompani
ment of a triumphant JI. V.
Kaltenborn. When H. V. tenored
that it looked like Ike had things
in the bag, one girl gut so excited

that she (1) screamed, (2) stepped through the wire
mesh on her float, (3) hit someone below the mesh
on the head, (4) heard him scream.
The Daily shack was a contrast in conflicting
emotions* The Daily was split 50-50, with all the
photography staff being Republicans. The excited
photogs ran around the shack, taking pictures of
every glum Democrat they could lind. With flash
bulbs yet.
Even the stagnant air of the reserved book room
was bestirred by the announcement that Eisenhower
was way ahead. Someone told someone, who in turn
told someone else, who in turn informed someone
else. Within three minutes physics, history, and
Fieneh were dead subjects, and the RBK was cleared,
leaving it there to itself to think quiet thoughts.

The move was to Chez Yvonne and Mangini's where
people were dropping off like the ants who taste En
cina food.
The campus had a new conversation piece yes
terday morning. Persons who had been meeting
other persons at the Cellar since the beginning of
the quarter and had never known quite what to
say to each other at least found a temporary solu
tion to their problem. "Gee, it's great that Ike won,
huh?" or "The Republicans will ruin America"
replaced the plastic smiles.
As one walked across the Quad, comments like
the following were common: "I hope that Ike doesn't
get shot in Korea, because if he does, Nixon will
become president and I'll transfer to Oxford Uni
versity." And "I'll bet old Harry is really swearing
now."
One tiling was certain. For the Democrats there
was no solace. To them, a truly great man who had
refused to compromise with his ideals had been
beaten. Something else was certain. Uneontained
Republican joy flowed all over the place. America
had solidly repudiated Trumanism, and elected a
great general.
In a few days, the topic of conversation at (he
Cellar will shift back to "the bees must go" and
about the horrible Cellar coffee. But right now,
it's all politics and there arc a lot of happy and
unhappy people on Quad.
And there is no one in between.

"Great Moments in Stanford Sports," which goes
on sale , today, had been getting excellent reviews in
San Francisco and Peninsula newspapers. The first
475 people to buy copies will get books autographed
by Bob Mathias, Chuck Taylor, Frankie Albert,
Everett Dean, and Dink Templeton.

ON ELECTIONS AND STUFF
I submit that there are many happy people on
campus this morning. And that there are many
unhappy ones too. And I would further venture to
say that there is nobody in between.
