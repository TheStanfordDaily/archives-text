# POLITICAL AFTERMATH
## In the 'Solid' South, Rebel Yells— In Capital, Cabinet Job Predictions 
### 
ATLANTA, Nov. 5 (UP) The Solid South was
split today.
With the enthusiasm of a rebel yell, voters in
T'.xas, Virginia, and Florida went ovor to ihe Ro
publican party. Not since Herbert Flocver won

election in 1923 had the area so de
serted the Democrats.
A nip and tuck battle still raged
in Tennessee and Republicans re
fused to give up hope that Dwight
D. Eisenhower would win the state
Returns from 2,411 of Tennessee's
, r ',sl!) precincts gave Adlai E. Ste
venson 412,427 votes to Eisenhower's
412,35ti after 20 hours of nip-and
tuck vote counting.
South Carolina went into the
Democratic column by only a slim
margin and Eisenhower's vote in
the state was split between an
"independent" slate and a regular
Republican one.
But many Southern Democratic
leaders who had openly supported
Eisenhower or rejected Stevenson
were quick to discount <he pos>i
bility of a permanent Republican
wedge in Dixie.
"It is evident that a major opera
t'cn was needed to remove a can
cerous growth from the Democratic
party," summed up Florida Demo
cratic National Committeeman
ilichard B. Barker, "That operation
has now been performed and the
patient has four years in which to
make a complete recovery."
The Eisenhower victory in Flor
ida, Barker said, "is a great indica
tion that Democrats in the state are
hick and tired of Trumanism."
The Eisenhower victory spread
to Congressional races in Virginia,
where the GOP picked up two
scats on victories by Richard M.
P. iff and William C. Wampler.
North Carolina, which went for
Stevenson for President, elected
its first Republican Congressman
since 1!)28. He is Charles R. Jonas
he 10th District, whose fathe
was the last Republican House
member from the state.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 (UP)—Gov. Thomas E.
Dewey of New York, twice defeated as Republi
can Presidential candidate, stood today at the
top of President-eject Dwight D. Eisenhower's
list of potential cabinet members.

Dewey, who played a major role
in Eisenhower's campaign, was re
ported under consideration for ap
pointment as Secretary ol State or
Secretary of Defense. He might be
offered his choice of either post.
Gov. Earl Warren of California
has been mentioned as a possible
choice for Attorney General, and
Gov. Dan Thornton of Colorado
might be offered the post ol Secre
tary of the Interior.
Several other Republican Gov
ernors also are high on the list of
possible cabinot members. Of
these, Gov. Sherman Adams of
New Hampshire, who was Eisen
hower's campaign chief of staff
and closest adviser, can just about
write his own ticket.
Adams might choose to become
Secretary of Commerce. But he also
might decide to join Eisenhower's
White House staff.
Other Governors who might join
Eisenhower's cabinet include Alfred
E. Driscoll of New Jersey, John
Lodge of Connecticut, Theodore F.
McKeldin of Maryland, Arthur B.
Langlie of Washington, arid John S.
Fine of Pennsylvania. Each has
played a part in electing Eisen
hower.
Sen. Frank Carlson of Kansas,
a close adviser to the President
elect throughout the campaign,
was reported a possible choice as
Secretary of Agriculture. But
Rep. Clifford R. Hope <>112 Kansas,
senior Republican on the House
Agriculture Committee, also was
regarded as a good< prospect for
this post.
Sen. Fred A. Seaton of Nebraska,
who has been at Eisenhower's side
throughout the campaign, also may
be in line for a cabinet or White
House appointment.

top of President-eject Dwight D. Eisenhower's
list of potential cabinet members.

South Carolina went into the
