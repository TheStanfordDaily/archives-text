# Truman, Ike Policy Meet

### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 (UP) â€”
President Truman offered his hand
and heart to Dwight D. Eisenhower
' today and agreed to do everything
possible to help the President-elect
I prepare for the crucial task con
fronting him,
lie invited the victorious Republi
can to meet him at the White House
for an extraordinary conference on
the problems of handing the reins of
government from one party to an
other.
The President, who e hopes for
four more years of Democratic
rule were lost in the Eisenhower
landslide, said he wanted to make
i! plain to the whole world "that
cuv people are united in the strug
gle for freedom and peace."
It appeared likely that Eisen
hower would take advantage of the
offer. Even as Mr. Truman issued
the invitation, Sen. Alexander Wiley
(R., Wis.) was proposing such a
pre-inauguration meeting.
Wiley, who could be the next
| chairman of (he Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said the two
men should discuss polity deci
! sions before the United Nations
that are of prime importance to
the Korean war.
Mr. Truman sent two telegrams to
his GOP successor, who was cele
brating a smashing victory over
Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson, the Demo
cratic nominee, in Tuesday's elec-
I tion.
