# SOCIAL POLICY
## Exam Reveals Unclear Rules 
### 
Stanford women need more edu
cation on social regulations.
That's the opinion of Women's
Council as a result of the social reg- !
ulations test given to sophomore, |
junior, and senior women two |
weeks ago. New social regulations !
booklets have been distributed with
an added section. explaining social
procedures and policies.
Of the 950 women who took the '
test, almost all knew that they could j
call their residence before closing j
hours to extend a late leave. How- I
ever, 120 did not know their regular '
phone number, and 241 women did I
not know their emergency number, j
Women's Council stresses that ;
permission to leave the residence ]
between 2:30 a.m. and 4:30 a.m. is [
granted by* a Council member only |
in an extreme emergency. The di- j
rector*rriust be notified. Permission
of the director, and not a Council
member, is needed to leave a dorm !
between 4:30 and G:3O a.m.
Most women knew that on a
granted appeal of luck-out minutes,
the bonus is not reinstated.
Many felt that if a girl signed out
on an overnight and returned after
the weekend, an offense was too
lifcht a penalty for failing to sign out
for the extra day, in comparison to
the lock-out minutes a girl incurs
when she fails to extend her late
leave before closing hours.
Women who have suggestions on
any of the social regulations are
asked to submit them to Women's
Council.
