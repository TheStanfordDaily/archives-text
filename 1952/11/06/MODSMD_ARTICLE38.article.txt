# Cards Work on Running For USC—Could It Be?
## 
### 
The running lights were ablaze in
the Stxirifor.l Indians' fooball prac
tice yesterday afternoon, as Chuck
TayJc'r worked long after the sun
went down polishing up his grid
dt.rs' running attack.
Nobody was knocking heads, but
Taylor had his men running plays
over and over again in dummy
scrimmage. All this gave further
indications that Taylor thinks he
may be able to run against USC's
terrible Trojans this Saturday.
Indian Line Coach Joe Ruetz said
yesterday,"I think our pair of
guards, Phil Wilson and Len Mayr
hol'er, are the equal of any in the
conference."
Since Ruetz has been claiming all
along that left tackle Jim Vick is
equal to the best in the business,
and that center Jerry Goldberg is
the quickest center off his blocks
Stanford has boasted in a long time,
the Indians may seriously dent the
Trojans' rugged forward wall this
weekend.
The Indians have been established
a 1.'3-point underdog in the betting
lor the game, and "athletic publicist
Don Liebendorfer says, "I'm not
sure I even consider that a good
bet, but nevertheless the boys have
not yet put together a whole ball
game up to their capability and you
never can tell."
Taylor did give his defensive
squad a little head knocking yes
terday, but even they turned to
dummy defensive maneuvers
against a simulated SC defense.
A breakdown of the current in
jury roster would go something like
this:
Ron Cook, starting offensive right
half: out of uniform today, but ex->
pected by all the coaches, trainers,
and team physicians to be ready to
start Saturday.

Joe Long, second-string lineback
er: found yesterday morning to have
broken the fibula bone in his left
leg following a rough collision in
Tuesday night's practice; out for the
rest of the season.
John Ludeke, offensive right
tackle: still hobbling cr» his badly
sprained right ankle, but expected
to be ready.
Ron Eadie, defensive right end:
injure! knee still holding up in
workouts; should be ready.
Chuck Essegian, left linebacker:
ditto to Eadie.
