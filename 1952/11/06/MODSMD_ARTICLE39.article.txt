Held to a 2 to 2 tie by San Fran- |
uisco State last Saturday, the var
sity soccer squad is now prepping
for a return game with undefeated
USF Saturday.
Coach Leo Weinstein is confident |
that the Dons "will be in for a sur- |
prise" Saturday morning, even j
though they have now won 41 J
straight games in conference play.
Weinstein said yesterday that |
thf improved Indians will be in J
their best physical condition of
the season and will be even more
strengthened by the return of
center half Derek Lieety, who will
be able to play for the first time
following a broken leg suffered
in the Olympic tryouts last spring.
The Stanford JV's dumped State
last Saturday 4 to 0, and will also
host USF in a preliminary this ;
weekend.

San Francisco has more parking |

world.
