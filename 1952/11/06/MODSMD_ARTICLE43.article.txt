Stanford over SC.

with 38 wins, 12 losses, and a .760
average.
Toddling close behind for no per
ceptible reason are Michael Hudson,
Philip Berman, and their two-head
ed coin. They are one game off the
pace with .740.
Jim Vick, who tied for top honors
last week with Tricky Dick Maltz-*
man at 8 and 2, is also tied for sec
ond at .740 and is moving up fast.
