Once upon a time there were four i
little sportsmen. They picked foot- '
ball games every week. They picked
SC over Stanford.
And at about this same time,
there were two bi£ football players
and one big coach. They picked
football games too. They picked
Stanford over SC.
Come Monday, there may be four j
openings on the Daily sports staff.
At present, ye old Stanford I
Sportsmen are leading the muscle j
men, namely co-captains Jim Vick
and A 1 Kirk land, and Coach
Chuck Taylor, by a scant .010
percentage points—.7lo to .700.
On the individual ledger; Kirk
land is one game ahead of the wolves
with 38 wins, 12 losses, and a .760
average.
Toddling close behind for no per
ceptible reason are Michael Hudson,
Philip Berman, and their two-head

pace with .740.
Jim Vick, who tied for top honors
last week with Tricky Dick Maltz-*
man at 8 and 2, is also tied for sec
ond at .740 and is moving up fast.
Three games off the pace is the j
Maltz, hitting .700, followed by
Daily Sports Editor (also for no per

'.660 and Chuck Taylor with .600.
In eighth place, holding up the

Once upon a time there were four i
little sportsmen. They picked foot- '
ball games every week. They picked
SC over Stanford.
And at about this same time,
there were two bi£ football players
and one big coach. They picked
football games too. They picked
Stanford over SC.
Come Monday, there may be four j
openings on the Daily sports staff.
At present, ye old Stanford I
Sportsmen are leading the muscle j
men, namely co-captains Jim Vick
and A 1 Kirk land, and Coach
Chuck Taylor, by a scant .010
percentage points—.7lo to .700.
On the individual ledger; Kirk
land is one game ahead of the wolves
with 38 wins, 12 losses, and a .760
average.
Toddling close behind for no per
ceptible reason are Michael Hudson,
Philip Berman, and their two-head
ed coin. They are one game off the
pace with .740.
Jim Vick, who tied for top honors
last week with Tricky Dick Maltz-*
man at 8 and 2, is also tied for sec
ond at .740 and is moving up fast.
Three games off the pace is the j
Maltz, hitting .700, followed by
Daily Sports Editor (also for no per
ceptible reason) Larry Cahn with
'.660 and Chuck Taylor with .600.
In eighth place, holding up the
rear with a 2 and 5 record and .276
average (picking only the Stanford
games) is W. Leiser, '20, represent
ing the alumni for no perceptible
reason.—D. M.
