# Phi Kaps, Defending Champs, Down Sigma Nu for Mural Lead
## 
### WESLEY MARX 
Doth winners ol their first five i
games, Phi Kap I and Sigma Nu 1
got in each other's pat ho on the
mural football fields yesterday and
Sigma Nu reluctantly gave way, 19
to 7.
The Phi Kaps, defending champs
in football, looked like they might
be derailed for a moment by the
spirited Sigma Nu seven. On a first
quarter scoring play Sigma Nu's
Bob Jurgenson threw a TD pass to
Jim Bauber to crash the game's
scoring first. Their conversion
proved good.
Lloyd Kelly led the Phi Kaps
back into the ball game as his pass
to Pete Pitsker went for six points.
But the Phi Kaps' conversion play
failed and the first-half tally had
Sigma Nu ahead 7-6.
Kelly and Pitsker got together on
another pass play which stopped at
Sigma Nu's one-yard line. From
there Kelly ran the ball over to put
the Phi Kaps ahead. Meanwhile the
Phi Kaps' defense shut the door
tight on any Sigma Nu scoring
hopes. For insurance Kelly caught
Chuck Malouf with another TD
pass. The victory gave the Phi Kaps
the inside track to represent their
league in the championship play
off-.
Village 208, fighting hard for their
first victory after four straight set
backs, came close but finally lost out
to Encina 2W 11, 13-6.
For the first score of the game
Encina put a little razzle dazzle to
gether with John Forbush flipping j

to Ray Waggoner who in turn later
al eci to Fritz Huntsinger who
crossed the goal line.
The Villagers countered with
Hugh Roberts hitting Bob Wilson
for six points. It looked like any
body's ball game into the wee mo
ments of the contest, but suddenly
Forbush pitched a strike to Larry
Foote in a long pass play which
went for a touchdown.
