# Bridge Club Seeks Varsity

### NAN CERINI 
Stanford has more than one Kin
(lame in the ofling. This year's
Stanford Bridge Club plans to re
new the post-war Stanford-Cal Bi;j;
Game bridge rivalry.
"But," says President Dave Wong, |
"our team needs depth. Cal can trot |
out platoon after platoon of fresh
reserves while we haven't even one
first string."
The club holds a duplicate tour
nament every Tuesday night at 7
in the lower lounge of the Women's j
Clubhouse. Both Wong and treas
urer Bob Currie stress the fact that j
"You don't have to be a good player >
to join the team. We need students
who like to play. They'll learn
quickly."
And club members insist, "Du
plicate is no different from eon- j
tract, just better."
B»'cati-.e the club belongs to the j
American Contract Bridge League, !

started by such bridge "greats" as
Ely Culbertson, members receive
national points for winning tour
naments.
The ACBL, a non-profit organi
zation, supports a number of blind
clubs who play with Braille cards.
Any undergraduate whose point
total is high in the Western Divi
sion of the ACBL is eligible for a
trip to Chicago, with all expenses
paid and $10 per day, to play in the
National Intercollegiate Bridge
Tournament. Ten years ago a Stan
ford pair finished-in this tourna
ment's top 10.
The club has already planned
matches against Santa Clara and
San Jose State for this year.
Teams f</r these tournaments, as
well as the Big Game meet, will
probably be chosen from elimina
tion matches in the Tuesday night
games.
