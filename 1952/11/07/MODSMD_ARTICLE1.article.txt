# Stanford Professor Awarded Nobel Prize in Physics
## Dr. Felix Bloch Announces Nuclear Induction Theory 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
Stanford professor Felix Bloch has been awarded the Nobel
Prize in Physics for his work in the field of nuclear induction, the
Swedish Academy of Science announced today.
The award was made jointly to Dr. Bloch and Professor E. M.
Purcell of Harvard University, who made the same discoveries
simultaneously and independently.f

In his work, Dr. Bloch developed
means of measuring the magnetic
properties of atoms with 99.095 per
cent accuracy. He bus done this by
using these magnetic properties to
pick up and transmit radio signals,
which may be accurately measured
on a cathode tube receiver.
The information that may he
obtained from these methods will
load to improvement of atom
smashing machines, more and bet
ter quantitative analysis in chem
istry, and a better understanding
<if the relationship between elec
tricity, magnetism, and structure
of matter.
As to strictly practical uses of nu
clear induction, Dr. Bloch comment
ed "no one can tell what It will lead
Jo, but it is now in the stage where
people arc beginning to be inter
ested in its possibilities."
The tall, wiry professor empha
sized that his discovery was not an
independent event. "My work in
this field is tied up with discoveries
preceding it,"he claimed. "It is
based on the contributions of my
distinguished predecessors. I have
profited from many sources, and
hope that my findings will serve as
stepping stones for someone else."
Dr. Bloch's discovery of nu
clear induction was made during
the last months of World War 11,
while he was working on radar
defense at the Radio Research
Laboratory at Harvard. He real
ized the possibilities which radio
techniques offered to physics; and
the thought occurred to him of
turning atoms into small radio
transmitters and measuring tin
signals given out.
At. the exact moment that the
thought occurred to him, Dr. Bloch
recalls that he wa.s amazed at its
simplicity, and wondered why no
one had done it before.
Dr. Bloch and his wife (who is
cilso a physicist) plan to travel to
Stockholm to receive the award,
which will be presented on Dec. 10.
the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's
death.
"I met Dr. Purcell onlv after
the discovery of nuclear induc
tion had been completely worked
out," said Dr. Bloch in his soft-

J voiced manner, speaking with a
slight continental accent. "I have
a great admiration for him, and
am happy to share the award with
I him."
The prize money is $33,037, and
j will be split between the two pro
! lessors.
Dr. Bloch wa.s born in Switzer
i land in 190 r >. At first he wanted to
| abandon his original desire of bc
j coming a scientist for the "more
practical" profession of engineering.
Hut, he admits, after taking a
course in beginning physics, he
dccidcd that lie "had to he a phys
icist—practical or not practical."
After his graduation, the young
| student studied under several great
masters in the field of physics, in
cluding Niels Bohr, founder of the
modern theory of the atom.
In 1932, when the Nazi regime
made life in Germany dangerous.
Dr. Bloch received and acccptcd
an invitation from Stanford to
come and teach physics.
He has taught at Stanford ever
I since, with the exception of the war
( years, instructing beginning classes
in physics as weli as graduate
courses and his own research work.

Dr. Bloch's discovery of nu
clear induction was made during
the last months of World War 11,
while he was working on radar
defense at the Radio Research
Laboratory at Harvard. He real
ized the possibilities which radio
techniques offered to physics; and
the thought occurred to him of
turning atoms into small radio
transmitters and measuring tin
signals given out.
At. the exact moment that the
thought occurred to him, Dr. Bloch
recalls that he wa.s amazed at its
simplicity, and wondered why no
one had done it before.
Dr. Bloch and his wife (who is
cilso a physicist) plan to travel to
Stockholm to receive the award,
which will be presented on Dec. 10.
the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's
death.
"I met Dr. Purcell onlv after
the discovery of nuclear induc
tion had been completely worked
out," said Dr. Bloch in his soft-

J voiced manner, speaking with a
slight continental accent. "I have
a great admiration for him, and
am happy to share the award with
I him."
The prize money is $33,037, and

MAN AND MACHINE—NobeI prize-winner Dr. Felix Bloch stands beside a nuclear induction
spectrometer in his laboratory. The spectrometer is used in determining properties of atomic
nuclei. The Stanford professor was notified yesterday that he and Dr. Purcell of Harvard had
been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their discoveries in the field of nucelar induction.
Stanford professor Felix Bloch has been awarded the Nobel
Prize in Physics for his work in the field of nuclear induction, the
Swedish Academy of Science announced today.
The award was made jointly to Dr. Bloch and Professor E. M.
Purcell of Harvard University, who made the same discoveries
simultaneously and independently.f

In his work, Dr. Bloch developed
means of measuring the magnetic
properties of atoms with 99.095 per
cent accuracy. He bus done this by
using these magnetic properties to
pick up and transmit radio signals,
which may be accurately measured
on a cathode tube receiver.
The information that may he
obtained from these methods will
load to improvement of atom
smashing machines, more and bet
ter quantitative analysis in chem
istry, and a better understanding
<if the relationship between elec
tricity, magnetism, and structure
of matter.
As to strictly practical uses of nu
clear induction, Dr. Bloch comment
ed "no one can tell what It will lead
Jo, but it is now in the stage where
people arc beginning to be inter
ested in its possibilities."
The tall, wiry professor empha
sized that his discovery was not an
independent event. "My work in
this field is tied up with discoveries
preceding it,"he claimed. "It is
based on the contributions of my
distinguished predecessors. I have
profited from many sources, and
hope that my findings will serve as
stepping stones for someone else."
