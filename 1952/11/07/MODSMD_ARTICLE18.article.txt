# Cards Face Bruising Line

### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford can't go to the Rosa
Bowl. Stanford can't win tho
PCC. But Stanford can beat
Southern California in tho Btq
Brown Bowl tomorrow, and
whipping the despised Trojanr.
will give them every bit a:; much
pleasure as doing either of tho
other two.
Starting time is 2 p.m., 70,000 arrs
expected, and odds-makers are say
ing that Southern California wilt r.>
ahead from one to two touchdowr
at 5 p.m. tomorrow.
Judging from the spirit displayed
in practice this last week, the Card.-,
are "higher" than at any other tnii r :
this year. Perhaps they remember
last year when they played tho
"spoiler." Last season, Southern
Cal had been undefeated in seven
straight, and was favored to land. in
Pasadena. The Indians, also undi
feated, topped USC 21 to HO in •
game that was dubbed "Game '>[
the Year."
A similar situation exists this
year. Again, Jess Hill brings.his
squad up with an unfettered v°;: ■
<>rd. Again. USC, along with UC
I'A, has a hopeful eye on Pa-.s
dena. Again, Stanford's cardinal
form looms on (he horizon as .1
"spoiler." Will history repeat?
Certainly, nothing would giv<-
Indians more sadistic pleasure
than (romping (he Trojans.
Victory over Southern Cal may
well depend on the meaty right m
of Bob Garrett, the blond sic, l a!
caller from San Marino. Few d.
line observers expect Stanford l<>
run through the Trojan line. It i,
anchored by guard FJmer Willhoib ,
210 pounds of All-American ennd
dacy. Coach Kill says, "Elmer ir;
unquestionably the finest guard I
have ever coached and probably ibe
best two-way guard in college JVr.t .
ball today."
Bob Peviani, at the.other guar !,
i;J almost as strong. Tackles Ch.-v
ley Anc and Bob Van Dorm, en ,:
Bill Hattig and Boh Hooks, and fir
backers George Timberlakc and
Marv Goux form what is probab' /
the strongest rushing defen:-," in
college football today. SC has .1
lowed its opponents an overage <>£
3V 2 points a game.
It may be remembered that < d
was held scoreless by the ga«
gantuan USC linemen, some!bins*
which last happened r,O ganv-v
ago.
And so Stanford's only hope r. t<>
pass and to pap.sand to pass, Chut':
Taylor remarked, "I think we hnvn
a better chance to beat Southern
Cal than Cal did, because we Iv."•
a different type of offen:;o." I'i " -
sumably, he was referring to ]>■>~. .
ing.
A Stanford victory tir.jon "w
will depend on more than jn 112
(iarrett's arm. It will depend on
the strongest pass protection lhat
the Indians have yet mustered. 11.
will depend on guys like Phil Wil

crick, and Jim Virk beiting t : ?>"
daylipght out of tho onrushing S(,
monsters.
It. will depend on receiver. I'cr.
Sam Morlcy, John (Mantis) Stein

they can do Morlcy, particular) /, «

finest receivers. He is not tli CjII
