# McCarthyism in Another Perspective
## 
### 
With the shouting over and the votes tallied,
we would like to make one final observation,
primarily because we are disturbed that many
followers of Adlai Stevenson consider Eisen;
bower's victory a victory of McCarthy ism
the recognized integrity of the Democratic
nominee.
Many factors accounted for the results —■
they've been hashed over many times since the
victory was announced. Yet we would analyze
one important specific factor, the emotional is
sue of McCarthyism — not in an attempt to
justify it, only to explain its occurrence.
Some followers oi the defeated candidate
have felt quite strongly that the victory for
Eisenhower was based on fear, a fear sym
bolized by Joseph McCarthy. They also feel
that these results indicate a trend toward a
limitation of freedom, as evidenced by the
California propositions on loyalty oaths. Mc-
Carthy, having done much to focalize the
issue of communism at home, is thus selected
as a cause for Stevenson's defeat.
While this is a reasonable assumption, there
is more to it than just McCarthy and his actions.
We are of the opinion that history makes the
man and McCarthy would not survive were
there not an environment receptive to his meth
ods and techniques. The present world situa
tion, with the conflicting powers, has created a
tense feeling of uneasiness and insecurity. This
is not limited to the United States, and it ob
viously was not the creation of Joseph Mc-
Carthy. The presence of McCarthy is not even

a unique phenomenon. Similar men — men
whose unprincipled attacks are substantiated
only by incomplete documentation and guilt by
association—exist now in other countries, and
have preceded him even here in the United
States, Before World Wars I and 11, the same
problems arose with the national and interna
tional uneasiness.
It is quite obvious that McCarthy has aided
and abetted this uneasiness, but similarly the
uneasiness aided and abetted him. And to
focalize the issues and the blame on Mc-
Carthy is to forget other significant factors,
none the least of which is the neglect of the
administration in power to make a greater ef
fort to alleviate the uneasiness of the people.
We believe that the administration did not
take sufficient steps to allay the fears of the
people — this was shown by the vote of last
Tuesday. There was not a sufficiently positive
counterattack to McCarthy's methods and the
Alger Hiss expose, to assure the people and
give them confidence in the government in
power.
While we will not say the election results are
ethically right or wrong, we only wish to point
out that the landslide vote can be partially de
cribed as a vote of no confidence in the present
administration—not as a rebuke for Stevenson.
It was a vote of great confidence in a man who
led a Crusade in Europe and a vote of no con
fidence for the man who has been in the White
House for the past seven years.
