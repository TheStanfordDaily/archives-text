# We're Hosts This Weekend
## 
### 
We're having guests this weekend. Thou
sands of Stanford alumni and students from the
University of Southern California will travel
here for the USC-Stanford game and homecom
ing festivities.
This is an important game. Our tripping up
the Trojan may determine the Rose Bowl team
ol 1953. But equally as important as the game is
our courtesy towards our visitors.
Flippant actions at the game and misconduct
at the parade can easily trip Stanford up--at
least in the eyes of the public and our visitors.
As a host we have several responsibilities:
1. We have an obligation to ourselves, and
our fellow students: in our actions and behavior.
We know how we would like to be treated as
guests.
2. We have an obligation to Stanford Univer
sity. For many USC students [his will be their

first trip north and their first trip to this campus.
Some say first impressions are lasting ones.
3. We have an obligation to the citizens of
Palo Alto. Cardinals has arranged for the float
parade to tour University Avenue. That means
that Palo Altans will be standing side by side
with Stanford students watching our floats. Car
dinals can only arrange for the parade, we have
the job of seeing it carried through successfully.
Tonight we can demonstrate our pride in Stan
ford by an earnest yet courteous spirit.
And this courteousness towards our guests
should be extended throughout the entire week
end.
La3t year we were the guests of USC. We
were commended by Los Angeles and Southern
California alumni for our behavior at the rally
and at the victorious game. We have shown we
can be good visitors. Now is the time to re
ciprocate hospitality.--,-ftuby Hernstein
