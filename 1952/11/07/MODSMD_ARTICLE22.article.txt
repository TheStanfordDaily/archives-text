# BULL SESSION
## 
### SAM FRESHMAN 
The American Feline Society, Inc. has now become
the world's largest cat organization. There no lcnger
is any argument about it!
So claims a publicity release received by the Daily.

The society has de
clared that this is Na
tional Cat Week and
that everyone should be
come acquainted with
cats as pets and utili
tarian adjuncts to the
Farm (exactly what util
itarian adjuncts to the
Farm are the release
failed to say but the
ASSU will probably set
up a committee to in
vestigate).
For those who are in
terested the group is
offering several acces
sories at varying prices.
Seals for use on enve

lopes, letters, and the freshly painted walls of your
dormitory (if they are freshly painted) can be had
for a stupidly low price of $1 per hundred. Samples

of t'nc reals are free. If you are planning to use them
I would advise ordering a hundred samples.
Fosters are available in any quantity desired and
the Corporation yard lias ordered 27,000 to use in
rebuilding parts of Stanford Village, (ilass wind
shield stickers are ottered gratis and it might be a
good idea to get a few to slap on top of those po
litical slogans you have on your car after the cam
paign. This idea takes on greater importance if
your candidate lost.
National Cat. Week insignia is also available but
only in limited quantities as the society had only
5 million insignia stamps printed up and there is no
telling how long they will last, probably four or five
years .it least.
To tho.;e of you who are naive enough to think that
an untruth or fiction would appear within the sacred
boundaries of this column, in other words doubting
tom-cats, you may write the AMERICAN FELINE
SOCIETY. INC., 41 Union Square West, New York 3,
New York, for verification.
Those of you who have been waiting for my special
series on "How to join a committee" please be patient.
It will probably begin in next Thursday's paper but
1 couldn't let cat. week go by without informing you
of it.

come acquainted with
cats as pets and utili
tarian adjuncts to the
Farm (exactly what util
itarian adjuncts to the
Farm are the release
failed to say but the
ASSU will probably set
up a committee to in
vestigate).
For those who are in
terested the group is
offering several acces
sories at varying prices.
Seals for use on enve

lopes, letters, and the freshly painted walls of your
dormitory (if they are freshly painted) can be had
for a stupidly low price of $1 per hundred. Samples

of t'nc reals are free. If you are planning to use them
I would advise ordering a hundred samples.
Fosters are available in any quantity desired and
the Corporation yard lias ordered 27,000 to use in
rebuilding parts of Stanford Village, (ilass wind
shield stickers are ottered gratis and it might be a
good idea to get a few to slap on top of those po
litical slogans you have on your car after the cam
paign. This idea takes on greater importance if
your candidate lost.
National Cat. Week insignia is also available but
only in limited quantities as the society had only
5 million insignia stamps printed up and there is no
telling how long they will last, probably four or five
years .it least.
To tho.;e of you who are naive enough to think that
an untruth or fiction would appear within the sacred
boundaries of this column, in other words doubting
tom-cats, you may write the AMERICAN FELINE
SOCIETY. INC., 41 Union Square West, New York 3,
New York, for verification.
Those of you who have been waiting for my special
series on "How to join a committee" please be patient.
It will probably begin in next Thursday's paper but
1 couldn't let cat. week go by without informing you
of it.
