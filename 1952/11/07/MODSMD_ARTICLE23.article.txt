## 'How Could the People...?! 
### 
To the Editor:
1 am a Stevenson man, and like so many of my
dazed brethren, I'm sitting down with an icebag on
my head, trying to figure out what hit us. Around
me the bubbling laughter of satisfied Stanfordites
assure me that the Farm too likes Ike.
1 wonder which of the General's many qualities
has captured public fancy? Perhaps it is Ike's prevar
ications about his own role in Asian policy (which
Senator Morse revealed last week). Tt might be his
absurdly delightful illogicalities (example: "the
measure of the Marshall Plan's contribution to sta
bility and well-being of Europe can lie appreciated
only by one who has seen the situation before and
after," but "Communism cannot be thwarted by a
hastily built wall here or an emergency dike there.")
Could it be the Republicans whom he has en
dorsed to help put his policies into practice? (It
is generally considered by most of the radio analysts
that it was Ike's endorsement of Senator Jenner,
who slandered his mentor and good friend General
Marshall on the floor of the Senate, which gave the
Senator his relatively navrow victory.)
I admit that the President-elect's ignorance about
domestic issues is attention-gettingâ€”it is unusual to'
hear a man expound labor policy who admits that
he's not quite sure about the difference between a
closed and a union shop, and who begins a'discussion

of domestic economics by promising to lop 20 billion j
dollars off of our budget in the next few years.
I am surprised, however, at our enlightened campus
accepting Senator Nixon so cheerfully. This is Nixon
the man, whose notorious campaign against MrsJ
Douglas for Senate hit a new low in filth in California,
and whose soap opera explanation (if you can call
it one) of his extra fund was insulting to the in
telligence (excepting Eisenhowers', who felt that Nix
on came out of his ordeal "a better man"). This is
Nixon, California's political representative, who voted
for the McCarran Act, to prevent abolition of poll
tax, to exempt railroads from the anti-trust laws,
to cut the Mutual Defense program, to deny $60
million in aid to Korea (1950), to cut public housing,
against higher taxes for excess profits, to kill federal
slum clearance, etc.
As an added delight, in the Republican Senate
the committees, which do most of the Senate work, j
will have the following heads (no pun intended):
Senator Taft, Labor; Senator Jenner, Rules; Sen
ator McCarthy, Executive Expenditures (with a
powerful investigating subcommittee); Senator
Capehnrt of the revolting tax amendments, Finance; |
and Senators Ferguson, Millikin, Bricker, et al.
How could the people let a man like Stevenson slip
through their fingers?
