### FRED NEIL Daily Trojan Sports Editor 
When the Trojans take the field Saturday, take a good look at No's 75.
711, and .'12. You'll see (1) three potential All-Americans, and (2) three
of the primary reasons for Troy's perfect record after six games.
Inside the jerseys carrying those numbers will be Bob Van Doren, Elmer
Willhoite, and Jim Sears respectively, all members of the great Trojan
defensive platoon, and we honestly believe, the top players at their positions
on the Coast, and very possibly in the nation.
Van Doren and Willhoite are two of the fastest big men you'll see
and if your Mr. Garrett has any ideas about passing come Saturday, I
would advise him to get back there and get his business done in a hurry.
If he doesn't, chances are tackle Van Doren and guard Willhoite, with
frequent assistance from Bill Hattig, Charlie Ane, and Marvin Goux, will
turn him every way but loose.
Some pretty fair passers—guys like Bob Burkhart of WSC; Dick
Thomas of Northwestern; Jim Withrow of OSC; and Pete Vann of Army—
have experienced a singular lack of success while trying to keep one eye
oil the charging Trojan forwards and the other peeled for an open re
reiver.
Willhoite in particular is a bear on defense though he also does a pretty
fair job at offensive guard. Last year he led the team in playing time with
387 minutes and will probably run one-two with Sears again this year.
Ball carriers are also big Elmer's meat as Johnny Olszewski can testify.
In the Cal-SC taffypull, the Bears fumbled twice and on both occasions
Johnny-0 was the bobbler after being hit by Willhoite.
Here's what a couple of SC coaches think of him. ,
Jess Hill, head coach—"Elmer is unquestionably the finest guard I
have ever coached and probably the best two-way guard in college
football today."
Don Clark, line coach—"Elmer's greatest value on defense is that he
attracts three offensive blockers wherever he lines up. This permits
SC's other forwards to get an easier route to the ball carrier."
Sears currently leads the nation in punt returns and many competent
observers maintain that he is far and away the top all-around safetyman
in collegiate football.
Going into Saturday's game, Sears has run back 211 punts for a total
of 431 yards in six games. He is only seven yards shy of the school record
set last year by Johnny Williams and just 47 short of the PCC mark set
by Jake Leicht of Oregon in 1947.
With four games left on the Trojan schedule, Jim is a cinch to set a
record that figures to stand for a long time.
Included among his exploits thus far this season are all-the-way
returns of 77 yards against Washington State; 66 against San Diego Navy;
and 69 against California.
Jim will also see a lot of action at the tailback spot on offense where
he has beaten out A1 Carmiehael and Rudy Bukich.
Carmichael will probably start and play most of the game at wingback
where he was stationed last year, and from where, incidentally, he gave
the Indians fits last year in the doliseum.
Des Koch, the nation's leading punter with a 44.8 average, may finally
get to play a little offensive football this Saturday after being limited to
• kicking exclusively so far with a gimpy leg.
Hill tried Koch out at tailback in scrimmage Friday and the big blonde
from Shelton, Wash, was a one-man riot. <n a little less than 15 minutes
he drove his team 60 yards, alternately running and passing, for a TD;
came back two minutes later and passed for another score in a play that
covered, pass and run, 63 yards; and a few minutes later slanted off tackle
and went 19 yards without a hand being laid on him.
Other standouts, all on the defensive platoon, are linebackers Goux and
Timberlake. who, have made Trojan fans forget all about Pat Cannamela,
last year's AA; and defensive halfbacks Lindon Crow and Jim Psaltis, each
of whom have swiped five enemy aerials so far.
All in all, we think we have a well-rounded team. Frankly we be
lieve we're going to the Rose Bowl. UCLA notwithstanding. Everybody
from Jess Hill down to the freshman manager feels that the cross
towners are getting iust a little too big for their britches and, after two
straight losses, figure it's time to put them in their place.
We also figure to have a ball game on our hands Saturday. Last year
we were all making plans to spend January the One in Pasadena when
along came Chuck Taylor and his very fine team to hand the Trojans a
27-20 shellacking.
We don't think it will happen again this year but everyone in the
Trojan party will be tickled to death when this one is over.

last year's AA; and defensive halfbacks Lindon Crow and Jim Psaltis, each
of whom have swiped five enemy aerials so far.
All in all, we think we have a well-rounded team. Frankly we be
lieve we're going to the Rose Bowl. UCLA notwithstanding. Everybody
from Jess Hill down to the freshman manager feels that the cross
towners are getting iust a little too big for their britches and, after two
straight losses, figure it's time to put them in their place.
We also figure to have a ball game on our hands Saturday. Last year
we were all making plans to spend January the One in Pasadena when
along came Chuck Taylor and his very fine team to hand the Trojans a
27-20 shellacking.
We don't think it will happen again this year but everyone in the
Trojan party will be tickled to death when this one is over.

When the Trojans take the field Saturday, take a good look at No's 75.
711, and .'12. You'll see (1) three potential All-Americans, and (2) three
of the primary reasons for Troy's perfect record after six games.
Inside the jerseys carrying those numbers will be Bob Van Doren, Elmer
Willhoite, and Jim Sears respectively, all members of the great Trojan
defensive platoon, and we honestly believe, the top players at their positions
on the Coast, and very possibly in the nation.
Van Doren and Willhoite are two of the fastest big men you'll see
and if your Mr. Garrett has any ideas about passing come Saturday, I
would advise him to get back there and get his business done in a hurry.
If he doesn't, chances are tackle Van Doren and guard Willhoite, with
frequent assistance from Bill Hattig, Charlie Ane, and Marvin Goux, will
turn him every way but loose.
Some pretty fair passers—guys like Bob Burkhart of WSC; Dick
Thomas of Northwestern; Jim Withrow of OSC; and Pete Vann of Army—
have experienced a singular lack of success while trying to keep one eye
oil the charging Trojan forwards and the other peeled for an open re
reiver.
Willhoite in particular is a bear on defense though he also does a pretty
fair job at offensive guard. Last year he led the team in playing time with
387 minutes and will probably run one-two with Sears again this year.
Ball carriers are also big Elmer's meat as Johnny Olszewski can testify.
In the Cal-SC taffypull, the Bears fumbled twice and on both occasions
Johnny-0 was the bobbler after being hit by Willhoite.
Here's what a couple of SC coaches think of him. ,
Jess Hill, head coach—"Elmer is unquestionably the finest guard I
have ever coached and probably the best two-way guard in college
football today."
Don Clark, line coach—"Elmer's greatest value on defense is that he
attracts three offensive blockers wherever he lines up. This permits
SC's other forwards to get an easier route to the ball carrier."
Sears currently leads the nation in punt returns and many competent
observers maintain that he is far and away the top all-around safetyman
in collegiate football.
Going into Saturday's game, Sears has run back 211 punts for a total
of 431 yards in six games. He is only seven yards shy of the school record
set last year by Johnny Williams and just 47 short of the PCC mark set
by Jake Leicht of Oregon in 1947.
With four games left on the Trojan schedule, Jim is a cinch to set a
record that figures to stand for a long time.
Included among his exploits thus far this season are all-the-way
returns of 77 yards against Washington State; 66 against San Diego Navy;
and 69 against California.
Jim will also see a lot of action at the tailback spot on offense where
he has beaten out A1 Carmiehael and Rudy Bukich.
Carmichael will probably start and play most of the game at wingback
where he was stationed last year, and from where, incidentally, he gave
the Indians fits last year in the doliseum.
Des Koch, the nation's leading punter with a 44.8 average, may finally
get to play a little offensive football this Saturday after being limited to
• kicking exclusively so far with a gimpy leg.
Hill tried Koch out at tailback in scrimmage Friday and the big blonde
from Shelton, Wash, was a one-man riot. <n a little less than 15 minutes
he drove his team 60 yards, alternately running and passing, for a TD;
came back two minutes later and passed for another score in a play that
covered, pass and run, 63 yards; and a few minutes later slanted off tackle
and went 19 yards without a hand being laid on him.

the Indians fits last year in the doliseum.
Des Koch, the nation's leading punter with a 44.8 average, may finally
get to play a little offensive football this Saturday after being limited to
• kicking exclusively so far with a gimpy leg.
Hill tried Koch out at tailback in scrimmage Friday and the big blonde
from Shelton, Wash, was a one-man riot. <n a little less than 15 minutes
he drove his team 60 yards, alternately running and passing, for a TD;
came back two minutes later and passed for another score in a play that
covered, pass and run, 63 yards; and a few minutes later slanted off tackle
and went 19 yards without a hand being laid on him.
Other standouts, all on the defensive platoon, are linebackers Goux and
Timberlake. who, have made Trojan fans forget all about Pat Cannamela,
last year's AA; and defensive halfbacks Lindon Crow and Jim Psaltis, each
of whom have swiped five enemy aerials so far.
All in all, we think we have a well-rounded team. Frankly we be
lieve we're going to the Rose Bowl. UCLA notwithstanding. Everybody
from Jess Hill down to the freshman manager feels that the cross
towners are getting iust a little too big for their britches and, after two
straight losses, figure it's time to put them in their place.
We also figure to have a ball game on our hands Saturday. Last year
we were all making plans to spend January the One in Pasadena when
along came Chuck Taylor and his very fine team to hand the Trojans a
27-20 shellacking.
We don't think it will happen again this year but everyone in the
Trojan party will be tickled to death when this one is over.

When the Trojans take the field Saturday, take a good look at No's 75.
711, and .'12. You'll see (1) three potential All-Americans, and (2) three
of the primary reasons for Troy's perfect record after six games.
Inside the jerseys carrying those numbers will be Bob Van Doren, Elmer
Willhoite, and Jim Sears respectively, all members of the great Trojan
defensive platoon, and we honestly believe, the top players at their positions
on the Coast, and very possibly in the nation.
Van Doren and Willhoite are two of the fastest big men you'll see
and if your Mr. Garrett has any ideas about passing come Saturday, I
would advise him to get back there and get his business done in a hurry.
If he doesn't, chances are tackle Van Doren and guard Willhoite, with
frequent assistance from Bill Hattig, Charlie Ane, and Marvin Goux, will
turn him every way but loose.
Some pretty fair passers—guys like Bob Burkhart of WSC; Dick
Thomas of Northwestern; Jim Withrow of OSC; and Pete Vann of Army—
have experienced a singular lack of success while trying to keep one eye
oil the charging Trojan forwards and the other peeled for an open re
reiver.
Willhoite in particular is a bear on defense though he also does a pretty
fair job at offensive guard. Last year he led the team in playing time with
387 minutes and will probably run one-two with Sears again this year.
Ball carriers are also big Elmer's meat as Johnny Olszewski can testify.
In the Cal-SC taffypull, the Bears fumbled twice and on both occasions
Johnny-0 was the bobbler after being hit by Willhoite.
Here's what a couple of SC coaches think of him. ,
Jess Hill, head coach—"Elmer is unquestionably the finest guard I
have ever coached and probably the best two-way guard in college
football today."
Don Clark, line coach—"Elmer's greatest value on defense is that he
attracts three offensive blockers wherever he lines up. This permits
SC's other forwards to get an easier route to the ball carrier."
Sears currently leads the nation in punt returns and many competent
observers maintain that he is far and away the top all-around safetyman
in collegiate football.
Going into Saturday's game, Sears has run back 211 punts for a total
of 431 yards in six games. He is only seven yards shy of the school record
set last year by Johnny Williams and just 47 short of the PCC mark set
by Jake Leicht of Oregon in 1947.
With four games left on the Trojan schedule, Jim is a cinch to set a
record that figures to stand for a long time.
Included among his exploits thus far this season are all-the-way
returns of 77 yards against Washington State; 66 against San Diego Navy;
and 69 against California.
Jim will also see a lot of action at the tailback spot on offense where
he has beaten out A1 Carmiehael and Rudy Bukich.
Carmichael will probably start and play most of the game at wingback
where he was stationed last year, and from where, incidentally, he gave
the Indians fits last year in the doliseum.
