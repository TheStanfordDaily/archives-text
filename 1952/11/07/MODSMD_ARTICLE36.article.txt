Stanford 7-4. It will be up to Bob Garrett to beat USC. Troy has shown
that they can stop better running attacks than Stanford's, but they have
yet to meet a passer as good as Garrett. They may rush him so hard,
however, that he won't get a chance to show off his passing prowess.
As for the Trojans, it's incredible that any contender for the Rose Bowl
should have such an inept offense. A weak running attack is augmented
by no passing. 01 course, it might jell any week, but we doubt it. Look
lor the best Troy defensive linemen to see plenty of action on offense too.
Tailback Sears may play most of the game at safety and Cannichael, Des
Koch (197), or Rudy Bukich (196) may play tailback. Lindon Crow (U)0)
or Sears may try thtf wingback position in case Cannichael goes to tail
back. The Trojans line up in a single-wing with the unbalanced line to, the
right so that they lint* up—end. guard, center, guard, tackle, tackle, end.

Edge to SC 9-2. A terrific defensive line and a great defensive backfield
give the Trojans a big edge on defense. Their line averages 208 pounds.
Such beasts as Ane, Peviani, Willhoite, and Van Doren, make Troy's line
the best in the nation. Timberlake at linebacker is considered just as good
us Pat Cannamela, while Jim Psaltis is a top-flight pass intercepter. Sears,
who shifts to safety on defense, has run back several punts for touchdowns
this year.—P.B.
Although Stanford is always up lor Troy, we must predict the worst.
USC won't b<? able to move against the Cards, but still they have the ability
to make their own breaks and then win on them—an interception, a fumble,
a runback—somehow they always push two or three scores across. Mean
while America's best defense will probably hold the Cards to no more
than one score. We look for USC to win by two touchdowns.
