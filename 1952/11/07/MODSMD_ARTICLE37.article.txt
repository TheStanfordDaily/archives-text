# Papooses Host USC
## 
### DON STEPHEN'S 
After a week's lay-off from the
football wars, the Stanford frosh
resume action against the highly
touted USC frosh this Saturday at
11 a.m. prior to the varsity con
test.
Conquerors of the strong UCLA
frosh. 48-0, and losers to a fighting
Santa Clara frosh club, 20-17, the
Papooses enter the tilt minus the
services of hard-running halfbacks
Jim Truher, Scott Jones, and Harry
Sykes. The trio is currently nurs
ing thigh injuries.
Jones and Truher, injured in
the Santa Clara game, have car
ried most of the offensive load in
the previous encounters, while
highly regarded Sykes has been
injured since prior to the UCLA
game. However, according to
frosh coach Bolt Ghilotti, Sykes
may see limited action this Satur
day.
Led by tailback Jim Decker, a
converted prep quarterback, the
Trojan frosh in two tilts have im
pressed load observers as the class
of Pacific Coast Conference frosh
ball. In their first outing, the frosh
were defeated, 26-14, by a Billy
Wade-led Coronado Naval Air Sta
tion team loaded with former col
lege and pro footballers. Wade, a
former Vanderbilt QB, was named
first draft choice by the Los Ange
les Rams.
Following the Coronado defeat,
the Trojans dumped the Cal frosh.
19-12. with a sparkling perform
ance from the defensive squad.
The Southern California back
field is one of the fastest on the
Coast, including varsity quartets.
Along with Decker, halfback Gor
don Duvall and fullback Roy Gae

112 Bel do the 100-yard dash in 10
flat.
When asked whether he expects
the most trouble from the Trojan
running or passing attack, Ghilotti
declared, "With an overall team
balance that is remarkable for frosh
ball, they can hurt you with either
offensive thrust. Consequently, a
j fluid defense is our only hope.''
