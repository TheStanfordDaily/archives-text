Stanford's soccer team will be 1
trying for the upset of the decade [
tomorrow, when it plays host to i
USF"s powerful squad beginning at
10 a.m.
The Indians, currently roosting in
second spot in the Northern Cal ;
soccer conference behind the unde- 112
feated Dons, have been pointing for !
the last two weeks for this crucial
and, according to Coach Leo Wein- j
stein, are "ready to put up quite a j
tussle."
The most critical item in the In- i
dians' list if "ifs" necessary to com- I
bine for a win will be the health of 1
center forward Ron Hall.

Hall has been suffering from a
I strained back for the past three
I weeks, and how much he is able to
play can make a biy difference in
I the outcome.

Elsewhere on the manpower front,
; Weinstein is wearing small smiles
jof pleasure since he will have the
services oi his number one halfback,
| Derek Liecty, for the first time this
! year.
Liecty broke a leg in the Olympic
i tryouts last spring, and has been
gaining strength very slowly all
through the season.
In a 9 a.m. preliminary the JV's
I will host the USF junior varsity. j
