# Liquor Referendum: Pros, Cons
## 
### DOROTHY DODGE Editor, The Daily 
A proposed solution to the
perennial college-age 1 i g u or
problem will be laid before the
student body Friday in a special
referendum on the ballot of the
ASSU final election.
The referendum will read:
"The students of Stanford Uni
versity resolve that the State of
California set the minimum legal
age for the purchase of beers, ales,
and wines containing less than 111
percent alcohol by volume at 18
years and provide persons between
the ages of 18 and 21 years with
non-transferable personal identi
fication which includes a picture
of the holder,
"1. Do you approve of this idea?
"2. Do you aprove of submit

ling this idea to the State Legis
lature?"
The referendum is the latest step
in an effort which began a year ago,
when the 1951 Excom passed a reso
lution favoring lowering the drink
ing age. The resolution was then
sent to other schools and interested
agencies.
The 1952 Excom decided last month
to submit the resolution to the stu
dent body in a referendum before
taking further action. ASSU Presi
dent Dick Weismann explains that
if the vote is "yes" on both questions,
the resolution will be sent to other
schools in an effort to start a united
college support for an attempt to
change the present liquor legislation.
Excom will also investigate
thoroughly the most workable way
of submitting the resolution to the
legislature. It has been emphasized
in Excom discussions that no ac
tion will be taken if the investi

gation shows (hat submitting the
resolution to the legislature would
be cither impractical or harmful to
Stanford.
An Excom committee composed of
Chairman Fran Kirk, Jean Leonard,
and Bob Rodolph has set up an edu
cation program to inform the voters
of the pros and cons of the issue.
Each Excom representative is re
sponsible for informing his constit
uents, and discussions on the ref
erendum will be held in house meet
ings and other gatherings.
Following is a summary of the
pros and cons on the resolution as
set up by the committee.
In favor of the idea:
1. The present law is unrealistic;
it is unsound Icgisation because it
is unenforccabe and consistency
vioated.
2. Eighteen would be a more
realistic minimum legal drinking
age because it is the age of such

responsibilities as military scrvi.ce,
marriage, and financial indepen
dence.
3. The citizens themselves would
help cnforcc a more realistic law.
4. If alcohol no longer had "the
lure of the forbidden," the individ
ual would be freer to exercise
mature judgment.
Against the idea:
1. Though tho 18-ycar-old col lego
student may be mature enough to
drink, the maturity of tho 18-year
old high school student is doubtful.
2. Lowering the drinking age
would create more problems with
youthful drivers.
3. There would probably bo more
drinking—especially among the bor
derline eases whom the law now
keeps from drinking.
4. Disrespect for the Hquor law
doesn't really carry over to other
laws; there is a direct comparison
between violating this and violating

speed laws.
112» favor of submitting the idea
to the legislature:
1. The resolution would be a
concrete first step toward allevia
ting what is now an intolerable
situation.
2. Though admittedly this par
ticular resolution has little chance
of success, it would at least start
the ball rolling.
Against submitting the resolution:
1. It would hurt Stanford's repu
tation to have the name of the Uni
versity attached to a resolution like
this.
2. It is not the student body's job
to attempt an action like influencing
legislation.

A proposed solution to the
perennial college-age 1 i g u or
problem will be laid before the
student body Friday in a special
referendum on the ballot of the
ASSU final election.
The referendum will read:
"The students of Stanford Uni
versity resolve that the State of
California set the minimum legal
age for the purchase of beers, ales,
and wines containing less than 111
percent alcohol by volume at 18
years and provide persons between
the ages of 18 and 21 years with
non-transferable personal identi
fication which includes a picture
of the holder,
"1. Do you approve of this idea?
"2. Do you aprove of submit

ling this idea to the State Legis

The referendum is the latest step
in an effort which began a year ago,
when the 1951 Excom passed a reso
lution favoring lowering the drink
ing age. The resolution was then
sent to other schools and interested
agencies.
The 1952 Excom decided last month
to submit the resolution to the stu
dent body in a referendum before
taking further action. ASSU Presi
dent Dick Weismann explains that
if the vote is "yes" on both questions,
the resolution will be sent to other
schools in an effort to start a united
college support for an attempt to
change the present liquor legislation.
Excom will also investigate
thoroughly the most workable way
of submitting the resolution to the

in Excom discussions that no ac

resolution to the legislature would

of the pros and cons of the issue.
Each Excom representative is re

uents, and discussions on the ref
erendum will be held in house meet
ings and other gatherings.
Following is a summary of the
pros and cons on the resolution as
set up by the committee.
In favor of the idea:
1. The present law is unrealistic;
it is unsound Icgisation because it
is unenforccabe and consistency
vioated.
2. Eighteen would be a more
realistic minimum legal drinking
age because it is the age of such

responsibilities as military scrvi.ce,
marriage, and financial indepen
dence.
3. The citizens themselves would
help cnforcc a more realistic law.
4. If alcohol no longer had "the
lure of the forbidden," the individ
ual would be freer to exercise
mature judgment.
Against the idea:
1. Though tho 18-ycar-old col lego
student may be mature enough to
drink, the maturity of tho 18-year
old high school student is doubtful.
2. Lowering the drinking age
would create more problems with

2. Eighteen would be a more
realistic minimum legal drinking
age because it is the age of such

responsibilities as military scrvi.ce,
marriage, and financial indepen
dence.
3. The citizens themselves would
help cnforcc a more realistic law.
4. If alcohol no longer had "the
lure of the forbidden," the individ
ual would be freer to exercise
mature judgment.
Against the idea:
1. Though tho 18-ycar-old col lego
student may be mature enough to
drink, the maturity of tho 18-year
old high school student is doubtful.
2. Lowering the drinking age
would create more problems with
youthful drivers.
3. There would probably bo more
drinking—especially among the bor
derline eases whom the law now
keeps from drinking.
4. Disrespect for the Hquor law
doesn't really carry over to other
laws; there is a direct comparison
between violating this and violating

speed laws.
112» favor of submitting the idea
to the legislature:
1. The resolution would be a
concrete first step toward allevia
ting what is now an intolerable
situation.
2. Though admittedly this par
ticular resolution has little chance
of success, it would at least start
the ball rolling.
Against submitting the resolution:
1. It would hurt Stanford's repu
tation to have the name of the Uni
versity attached to a resolution like
this.
2. It is not the student body's job
to attempt an action like influencing
legislation.
(Editor's note: Further analyses
of the pros and cons of the resolu -
tion will appear in The Daily to
morrow and Wednesday. For edi
torial comment, sec page two of
