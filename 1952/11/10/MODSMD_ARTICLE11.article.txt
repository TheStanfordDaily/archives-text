# Blood Donor Sign-ups Begin Today
## 
### 
Appointments for students wish
ing to donate their blood in the Red
Cross blood drive Thursday and
Friday will be taken today and to
morrow at booths set up in front
of the Cellar and the Main Libe.
Students under 21 must have their
parents' written consent on Red
Cross permission blanks.
The Red Cross mobile unit will
set up its donation headquarters in
the Women's Clubhouse.
The whole donation procedure
takes about one hour. This includes
time out for refreshments of coffee
and doughnuts after the donation.
Donors must weigh over 110
pounds, must not have given blood

within the past three months, and
must have had no recent immuni
zations, communicable diseases, or
colds.
The need for blood is still great.
As well as the constant demand for
it in Korea, plasma is needed to
build up reserves for civil emer
gencies.
Stanford's goal in the drive is 500
pints. ,
The blood" drive is being spon
sored by the Student Health Com
mittee with the assistance of A Phi
O, national service fraternity, which
is supplying workers to man the
appointment booths. Bill Tocher is
head of the drive.
