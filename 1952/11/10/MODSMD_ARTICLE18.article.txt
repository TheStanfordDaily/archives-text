# On the Liquor Referendum
## 
### 
Friday you'll be asked to make a big de
cision.
What you decide may influence a lot of
• people's lives.
Wo want to ask you to do a lot of thinking
before you vote.
The decision involves the ever-present liquor
problem—in particular, the question of lower
ing the drinking age. Just a year ago, the ASSU
Excom passed a resolution favoring lowering
the legal drinking age to 18 on 13 percent'alco
holic beverages . . . besides providing picture
bearing ID cards for 18- to 21-year-olds.
Friday—in a special referendum on the ballot
for the ASSU final election —you'll be asked to
i state whether you aprove of this idea.
I It's not a black or white issue. There are
; plenty cf arguments against lowering the
drilling age. One wonders about permit
ting the 18-year-old high school student to
drink . . . about the ptobable increase in
J drinking in.general . . . about alcohol lor
youthful drivers.
But on the other hand we come smack up
against the present deplorable situation, where
minors consistently and flagrantly violate the
;law. Plainly something must be done in the
way of enforcement or a more equitable law.

We must consider seriously if lowering the
drinking age to 18 the age when a young per
son is asked to assume so many other respon
sibilities—would not be a realistic solution to
the problem.
• You'll also be asked to answer a second ques
tion in Friday's election: do you approve of
submitting the resolution to the State Legis
lature?
A lot of people hesitate to attach Stanford's
name to a resolution lijce this. They fear dam
age to Stanfords' reputation.
The other viewpoint is that Stanford should
be proud to encourage action—-that a repu
tation lor generating ideas and standing be
hind them is nothing to be ashamed.ot. There
is the viewpoint, too, that if the student body
feels the drinking age should be lowered the
inevitable next step is to do something about
it.
This is only a brief sketch of the factors in
volved. During the rest of the week. The Daily
will bring you a more detailed discussion of the
pros and cons. You'll be hearing about them,
too, in your house and other meetings.
We urge you to find out what's involved and
do some thinking before you vote Friday. Make
sure your decision's a good one.

ing the drinking age. Just a year ago, the ASSU
Excom passed a resolution favoring lowering
the legal drinking age to 18 on 13 percent'alco
holic beverages . . . besides providing picture
bearing ID cards for 18- to 21-year-olds.
Friday—in a special referendum on the ballot
for the ASSU final election —you'll be asked to
i state whether you aprove of this idea.
I It's not a black or white issue. There are
; plenty cf arguments against lowering the
drilling age. One wonders about permit
ting the 18-year-old high school student to
drink . . . about the ptobable increase in
J drinking in.general . . . about alcohol lor
youthful drivers.
But on the other hand we come smack up
against the present deplorable situation, where
minors consistently and flagrantly violate the
;law. Plainly something must be done in the
way of enforcement or a more equitable law.

We must consider seriously if lowering the
drinking age to 18 the age when a young per
son is asked to assume so many other respon
sibilities—would not be a realistic solution to
the problem.
• You'll also be asked to answer a second ques
tion in Friday's election: do you approve of
submitting the resolution to the State Legis
lature?
A lot of people hesitate to attach Stanford's
name to a resolution lijce this. They fear dam
age to Stanfords' reputation.
The other viewpoint is that Stanford should
be proud to encourage action—-that a repu
tation lor generating ideas and standing be
hind them is nothing to be ashamed.ot. There
is the viewpoint, too, that if the student body
feels the drinking age should be lowered the
inevitable next step is to do something about
it.
This is only a brief sketch of the factors in
volved. During the rest of the week. The Daily
will bring you a more detailed discussion of the
pros and cons. You'll be hearing about them,
too, in your house and other meetings.
We urge you to find out what's involved and
do some thinking before you vote Friday. Make
sure your decision's a good one.
