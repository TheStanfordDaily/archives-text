# Korea Turns to You

### 
Bombs and blood—they go together.
Right now in Korea, the stock of blood plasma
is dangerously low, partly because people have
grown complacent about the fight—people who
felt that the decline in the number of casualties
meant that blood was no longer in demand.
Then there are the people who just haven't
gotten around to giving blood. There's a war
on in Korea, but somehow they haven't found
the time for it.
And the people who don't like the
idea of losing a pint of blood—even though the
Red Cross has carefully restricted blood doners

to people who are physically capable of giving,
(not to mention the fact that it really doesn't
hurt).
This week Stanford can show that none of
these people are on campus by reaching its
500-pint goal. Today and tomorrow appoint
ments can be made for the Red Cross mobile
unit, which arrives Friday.
Last year, Stanford made more appointments
than the unit could handle, topping its quota.
Let's crowd them again this year.
