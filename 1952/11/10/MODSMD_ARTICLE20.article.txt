# We Need Other Things More Than Grass
## 
### 
We just left another discussion on Tom
Elormt's proposal to plant grass in Inner Quad.
Wednesday night Excom aproved Blount's
request for a committee to investigate the pro
posal and ever since, bull sessions have mulled
over the pros and cons.
We've heard mostly objectionsâ€”grass would
be muddy in winter even with concrete walk
ways . . . it would be moie work that it would
b<s worth .. . and some people even think grass
v.jpuld be less attractive than the present gravel.
But we give most weight to the argument that
Stanford needs a lot of things a lot more than
iffteeds grass in Inner Quad . . . the argument
tfost as long as someone is spending a lot of
n-iorley and doing a lot of work, it might as well
be devoted to things like better lights for the

libraries, improved housing, or new activities
buildings.
However, there is another side to the coin.
It's the fact that someone isn't afraid to pro
pose a change, that someone has been look
ing around with clear and critical eyes and
has suggested a novel improvement.
The Daily congratulates Torn Blount on his
initiative and lends its support to his commit
tee's right to investigate the feasibility of the
change he proposes.
However, we hope they will look at the sug
gestion from an all-University perspective, and
we feel sure that if they do, they will see that
there are many other problems more worthy
of time, money, and effort than planting grass
in Inner Quad.
