### DICK MANSFIELD 
Farley Gimp was at Stanford for only two quarters
l&fore retiting to rest on his laurels. But in those two
quarters Farley Gimp was the most studious-looking
tiKle ever to prance across Inner Quad. Not to say
th<it_ Gimp was studious. He just looked studious.
I&ere were tilings he did. There were things he
seemed to do. Though he never cracked a syllabus
in'fwo quarters of Stanford life, at retirement he was

offered a large salary just»to re
main on campus and look stu
dious. He declined gracefully.
When he first arrived at Stan
ford, Gimp invested in four
Scriptp pencils and a large, plain
ring binder. The pencils Gimp
wore in a row in the pocket of
his polo shirt. The ring binder
h'_> carried everywhere with him.
Whenever he got anywhere, Gimp

would whip out the binder and
a Scripto and start taking notes. Almost no one knew
that Gimp had no paper in the binder. And no lead
in three of the Scriptos. But everyone observed that
Gimp was a meticulous note-taker, even at the Sim
day Evening movies.
Gimp always had his hand up in class. He had two
b "thods. One was to raise his hand slightly off the
ctjsk. The teacher always felt that he had his hand
up, but was never sure enough to call on him. Gimp's
other method was to raise his hand suddenly just
as someone else began to talk. When someone else
stopped talking, Gimp would suddenly drop his hand,
explaining tolerantly that someone else had made

his point, and "repetition is senseless." This gen
erally pleased the teacher.
Gimp's book - carrying technique was superb.
First, he wrapped all his books, including two copies
of the Wizard of Oz and some overdue library books,
in Stanford hook jackets. Just a stack of books in
hook jackets on his desk showed the boys. He
wrote such things as "Existential Calculus—Volume
4" on the jackets. Then, when it was maybe three
minutes before class time, Gimp would grab an
armful of these books at random, stack them on
his (empty) ring binder, and run—never walk
to class. Or maybe just to the Cellar. But he ran,
and no matter where he was going - , he always
routed himself through Quad, and preferably En
gineering Corner.
Studious repartee was Gimp's best gambit. If the
boys were clamoring for a quick trip down to Paly
for some wild times. Gimp would never say "Who
wants to kick around tbut burg?" He would say
"Gee, fellas, that would be great and you know I'd
like to, but I've got to put in a little time on my
Geology tonight . . ." Gimp never took Geology in
his life, and wouldn't have known the difference be
tween a rock and a lill. As soon as the boys had
left, Gimp would close his comic book and trot off
to Roble.
Yes, there are those who can get good grades and
there are those who can learn a lot, but nobody will
ever be as studious-looking as Farley Gimp was. Of
course, it was a full-time job with him. When he
was through looking studious, he had very little, if
any, time left for studying.
