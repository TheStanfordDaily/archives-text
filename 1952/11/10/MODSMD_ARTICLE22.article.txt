## On McCarthyism 
### 
To the Editor:
The election is over, so knock off the editorials,
Walt-r-Your sleazy apoldgies for McCharthyism [sic]
ring -'no bfi.ll. If McCharthy is right, America is wrong,
because this country was founded to get away from
the kind of thought control he would like to impose.
In spite of your compelling logic, "we" believe that
Ihe man makes history, not vice versa—though pos
sibly this is not true for Republicans. If times are

tough, then we need real men, not fear-crazed juve
nile delinquents like McCharthy, in office.
McCharthy's victory is, as you say, a victory for
fear. It is a victory for infantilism, for the wish to
be told what to do, for the wish to find a scapegoat,
for the wish to hurt that scapegoat, for the hidden
sadistic drives that lie behind every witch hunt. The
concepts and techniques of McCharthyism are shock
ingly similar to those used too ably by that other great
student of the psychology of fear, Adolph Hitler—you
don't hear his name much any more.
