## Firemen Foil Bonfire Sabotage Plans

Blazing Big Game bonfire lumber
lent an orange glow to the night sky
Saturday at 9:30 p.m.
The Stanford Fire Department ar-

Bonfire Commit lee chairman
Chuck Kashima hus asked living
groups to a<ki the lumber from
their homecoming floats to the
wood collection in the lake Led.

rived minutes after the fire began,
and the second attempt to burn this
year's growing pile of wood in Lake
Lag was thwarted in 15 minutes.
Two piles of wood were kindled,

including some vital two-by-fours.
The major damage, however, was to I
brush, of which there is no short- j
age.
Slightly more than a week ago a
similar incident got the firefighters
out of bed in the small hours of the
morning. At that time one pile of
wood was burned.
The (ire department believes that ■
in both cases gasoline was used to
cause a quick blaze. •
Freshman guards will he posted
at Lake Lag beginning Wednes
day night to prevent future at
tempts to retard construction of
the bonfire. Wednesday is the
scheduled day lor the sinking of
the telephone poles which will
form the major side supports of
(he triangular construction. The
(op of the pyre, above tin- braces,
will be pyramid shaped. A deco
ration of Big Game theme will top
off the pyramid. Rod Smith of
Stern is decoration chairman.
John Free will supervise the dig
ging of the bonfire's flues Thursday
afternoon. Actual Construction be

gins Saturday, 8 a.m. to noon. As I
has been the tradition, Roble and
Branner women will serve refresh
ments to the freshman men as they
work.
Despite the recent mishaps, Bon
fire Committee chairman Chuck
Kashima describes the woodpile as
"very good." The bandhouse porch
has been torn down and added to it,
railroad ties have been obtained,
and 2,000 fruit crates are being
brought in from Mountain View.
