# THE 						DU PONT DIGEST
## Production for M.E.'s 
### 
Du Pout's manufacturing side offers opportunity to mechanical engineers

Tlio young mechanical engineer in
terest, od in production finds plenty
of opportunity atDu Pont. His skills
are in great demand because so many
of this Company's products are made
in equipment which must operate
continuously on automatic controls.
More than half of Du Pont'sM.E.'s
are currently engaged in some phase
of production work. There are three
main categories.
1. MAINTENANCE SUPERVISION. Re
source fulness and initiative are
needed in men selected for this work.
Among their many duties are the
scheduling of preventive mainte
nance and emergency repairs to mini
mize down time, suggesting equip
ment improvements to reduce the
maintenance load, and estimating
costs of changes or major repairs.
Normally, the supervisor estab
lishes maintenance procedures, di

rects transfer of personnel from one
group or area to another, and assigns
duties. He sets up office and field
work methods and controls the sup
plies of spare parts and stores.
The importance of this work is
emphasized in some Du Pont plants
where more men are needed to main
tain the equipment than to operate
it. At one plant, the division main
tenance superintendent, a man with
several years experience behind him,
is responsible for 1,500 pieces ot
equipment and 100 miles of pipe. He
lias 120 men under him, including
10 foremen.
1. PRODUCTION SUPERVISION.Other
mechanical engineers at Du Pont
use their knowledge of mechan
ical equipment in solving production
problems. They must see that raw
materials are on hand, that maxi
mum yields are obtained with mini
mum loss, and that the products meet

3. PLANT TECHNICAL. Other
M.E.'s at Du Pont are assigned to
the teams of plant technical men re
sponsible for process and production
improvements. In this work, they
help solve problems on machine de
sign, strength of materials, control in
struments, packing materials for
high-pressure equipment, etc.
Actually—in maintenance, pro
duction and development I lie pos
sibilities are almost unlimited at
Du Pont for the M.E. who likes the
manufacturing side of industry.

Tlio young mechanical engineer in

of opportunity atDu Pont. His skills
are in great demand because so many
of this Company's products are made
in equipment which must operate
continuously on automatic controls.
More than half of Du Pont'sM.E.'s
are currently engaged in some phase
of production work. There are three
main categories.
1. MAINTENANCE SUPERVISION. Re
source fulness and initiative are
needed in men selected for this work.
Among their many duties are the
scheduling of preventive mainte
nance and emergency repairs to mini
mize down time, suggesting equip
ment improvements to reduce the
maintenance load, and estimating
costs of changes or major repairs.
Normally, the supervisor estab
lishes maintenance procedures, di

rects transfer of personnel from one
group or area to another, and assigns
duties. He sets up office and field
work methods and controls the sup
plies of spare parts and stores.
The importance of this work is
emphasized in some Du Pont plants
