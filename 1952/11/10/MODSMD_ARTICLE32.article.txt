# A 						Happy Hill Praises Offense; A Sad Hill Fears Next 3 Foes
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
The USC dressing room was a scene of tumult and shouting after
Troy's slaughter of the Cards. Although Coach Jess Hill wouldn't
admit it, the victory was obviously a sweet one to the men of
Troy, who well recalled last year's 27-20 beating which knocked
USC out of the Rose Bowl race.
Coach Hill was a man of many moods after the game. He was

showed they could be passed !
against. I honestly think they felt j
that we couldn't throw a long pass. 1

elated that his offense had finally*
jelled enough to produce five touch
downs without the defense's help,
and he was worried over the per
form*-nee of USC's final three l'oes.
He praised backs such as Rudy
Bukich, A 1 Carmichael, and Leon
Sellers, who finally looked good
for Troy after seven games of
mediocrity. He was especially
pleased about the performance of
Addison Hawthorne, who showed
tremendous power at the fullback
post. Hawthorne, the first Negro
athlete in USC history, has been
suffering from a knee injury, but
now he is in good shape. Last
year he sparked Pasadena JC to
the Little Rose Bowl and now he
may spark the Trojans to the big
Rose Bowl.
Hill asked- how many yards the
Trojans had amassed running and
passing. When told the total was
over 500, the short- bespectacled
ex-track coach smiled and said, 'Til
take that. You know the offensive
boys have been taking a real beat
ing in the papers, but they finally
showed their stuff foday." When
asked if the Trojans had planned
to pass as much as they did, Hill
replied, "Sure, Stanford's record

I
Our team showed real balance to
day."
Hill countered charges that he
poured it on, by pointing out that
his second- and third-stringers
played more than his starters. He
also addetl that his first-string
defense are the boys who are go-

| ing to have to throttle backs like
l Don Heinrich, Paul Cameron, and
Johnny Lattner in future games
and they need plenty of practice.
Hill was dismayed at the thought
I of Troy's final three foes, Washing
ton, UCLA, and Notre Dame, Wash
j ington beat Cal worse than Troy
1 did. UCLA, which will meet USC
;on Big Game day, has won seven
I straight, and Troy's final foe, Notre
Dame, last Saturday defeated na
! lionally fourth - ranked Oklahoma.
''I shake my head," said Hill.
Troy's All - American candidate,
Elmer Willhoite, who did nothing to
diminish his stature, said that the
middle of Stanford's line was as
rough as any he has faced all year.
"Every tiling just seemed to go
wrong for Stanford," he said, in the
j understatement of the year.


UP AND OVER—Leon Sellers, a hard charging fullback for SC all afternoon, moves over the
line of scrimmage for a good gain against the Indians. Throwing the terrific block for SC is end
Tom Nickeloff (80). Southern California man on the ground (72) is Chuck Weeks. Stanford player
in the background is Bill Storum (51), while the player who looks as if he were being piled on in
the lower right hand corner is George Bozanic. —Daily photo by Fred Chez

and they need plenty of practice.
Hill was dismayed at the thought
I of Troy's final three foes, Washing
ton, UCLA, and Notre Dame, Wash
j ington beat Cal worse than Troy
1 did. UCLA, which will meet USC
;on Big Game day, has won seven
I straight, and Troy's final foe, Notre
Dame, last Saturday defeated na
! lionally fourth - ranked Oklahoma.
''I shake my head," said Hill.
Troy's All - American candidate,
Elmer Willhoite, who did nothing to
diminish his stature, said that the
middle of Stanford's line was as
rough as any he has faced all year.
"Every tiling just seemed to go
wrong for Stanford," he said, in the
j understatement of the year.


UP AND OVER—Leon Sellers, a hard charging fullback for SC all afternoon, moves over the
line of scrimmage for a good gain against the Indians. Throwing the terrific block for SC is end
Tom Nickeloff (80). Southern California man on the ground (72) is Chuck Weeks. Stanford player
in the background is Bill Storum (51), while the player who looks as if he were being piled on in
the lower right hand corner is George Bozanic. —Daily photo by Fred Chez

The USC dressing room was a scene of tumult and shouting after
Troy's slaughter of the Cards. Although Coach Jess Hill wouldn't
admit it, the victory was obviously a sweet one to the men of
Troy, who well recalled last year's 27-20 beating which knocked
USC out of the Rose Bowl race.
Coach Hill was a man of many moods after the game. He was

showed they could be passed !
against. I honestly think they felt j
that we couldn't throw a long pass. 1

elated that his offense had finally*
jelled enough to produce five touch
downs without the defense's help,
and he was worried over the per
form*-nee of USC's final three l'oes.
He praised backs such as Rudy
Bukich, A 1 Carmichael, and Leon
Sellers, who finally looked good
for Troy after seven games of
mediocrity. He was especially
pleased about the performance of
Addison Hawthorne, who showed
tremendous power at the fullback
post. Hawthorne, the first Negro
athlete in USC history, has been
suffering from a knee injury, but
now he is in good shape. Last
year he sparked Pasadena JC to
the Little Rose Bowl and now he
may spark the Trojans to the big
Rose Bowl.
Hill asked- how many yards the
Trojans had amassed running and
passing. When told the total was
over 500, the short- bespectacled
ex-track coach smiled and said, 'Til
take that. You know the offensive
boys have been taking a real beat
ing in the papers, but they finally
showed their stuff foday." When
asked if the Trojans had planned
to pass as much as they did, Hill
replied, "Sure, Stanford's record

I
Our team showed real balance to
day."
Hill countered charges that he
poured it on, by pointing out that
his second- and third-stringers
played more than his starters. He
also addetl that his first-string
defense are the boys who are go-

| ing to have to throttle backs like
