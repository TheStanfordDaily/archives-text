Al its meeting of March 5,
1948, the ASSU Excom voted to
place the following question on

the spring election ballot:
"Do you favor the Foreign Schol
arship Plan (as proposed by the
Foreign Scholarship Committee and
tentatively approved by the Execu
tive Committee) involving a maxi
mum expenditure of $9,050 from
ASSU funds?"
On April 21, the .student body

gave a 2 to 1 affirmative vote to
the proposal. Stanford was thus es
tablished as the only major univer
sity in the United States with an as
sociated students' foreign scholar
ship program.
The program (and its presenta
tion to the students in the elec
tion) was brought about by a
meeting in January, 1!M8, between
eight Stanford students and the
Dean of Students to discuss Stan
ford's position in world afTairs.
The group concluded that one of
the outstanding problems of. the
day was the fact that "most Euro
pean nations have no valid means
of learning about the people of
the United States, and we have
insufficient means of learning
about them."
Bob Coats, the chairman of the
first Foreign Scholarship Committee,
in 1948 set forth the provisions of
the program:
1. Eight to ten foreign students
are granted a scholarship covering
expenses for a year of study at
Stanford.
2. The scholars are chosen on the
record of academic achievement,
financial need, knowledge of Eng
lish, and, most important, potential
community leadership.
3. The program is financed jointly
by the Associated Students, the
University, and the various living
groups which house the scholars.
The University and the ASSU split
the cost of tuition .
Coate also explained the long
range goal of the program:
"The future leaders of every
nation are now in the universities
of those nations. If we who are
materially fortunate can make it
possible for students to intcr

mingle, live together, and share
common experiences, the mutual
understanding resulting should be
such that 20 or "0 years from now
there will be a little more under
standing and trust among the
people of the world."
Opposition to the proposed for
eign scholar program was strong in
the weeks previous to its approval
by the students. ASSU President
Tom Martzloff urged the voters to
reject the plan as an "untried and
unproven idea." He argued that for
the sake of "sound administration"
the Associated Students should in
augurate a "smaller scale plan."
Student Manager Gene Mitguard at
tacked the "financial unsoundness"
of the proposal.
Committee chairman Coatc, in
urging the adoption of (he propo
sal. asked the students to consider
such ideas as "communion be
tween minds" an(< "world under
standing."
Stanford students agreed with
Coate, repudiated the "sound ad
ministration" arguments, and the
ASSU Foreign Scholar Program be
came a reality. Since 1948, a total
oi 34 foreign students, including the
eight foreign scholars at Stanford
this year, have received its awards.
