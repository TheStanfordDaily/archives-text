# 54-Highest Yet Against Cards
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
It was a long afternoon.
That wasn't a team from the
YMCA pigmy league which lost
to Southern California; that was
Stanford, and any resemblance
between the Stanford team of
last Saturday and the Stanford
of previous games was purely
horrible.
The game went like the Presiden

tial election. The pollsters predict
ed Southern Cal, but cautioned it
would be close. But Troy, like Ei
senhower, won in a landslide wHh
54 doctoral votes going to USC, 7
j to Stanford.
Actually, the real competition
last Saturday was between South
ern Cal and UCLA. The two were
not cngpftcd in physical contact,
hut they were engaged in a scor
ing battle. Could UCLA run up a
higher total against Oregon State I

than USC could against Stanford?
Finally, the Bruins won, notching
57 points to Troy's 54. It was
Stanford's only solace of Hie af
ternoon.
The 54 points that USC gloatingly
placed on the scoreboard represented
the largest total ever scored against
an Indian team. They've been play
ing football at Stanford since 1802.
The previous high was 49 to 0, made
by Michigan in 1902.
Also, the game marked the fourth

seconds of play.
Skip Crist was the only hack
who played a really good game.
He carried the hall 15 times for
a 4.3 average and was the onlj
Stanford man to run with the hall
in the third quarter, except fur
quarterback Jack (.chert's one at
tempt. Gehert, incidentally, turned
in a creditable game. He came in
I'm Hoh Garrett in the third quar
ter after Garrett injured his
shoulder.
The game was simply a matter of
Southern Cal doing no wrong and
Stanford doing no light. Except for
a few spurts, the Indian offense was
practically non-existent and the
Card pass defense was a shame.
The Indians sustained several in

juries, few of them serious. Bob i
Garrett incurred a shoulder pointer,
and Bob Mathias a sore back. Skip
Crist and Paul Revak suffered
broken noses and Phil Wilsoh a bad
eye from an elbow poke. The most
serious injury was received by end
Bob Hoegh ... a badly sprained
ankle with a possibility of a broken
bone. He'll be out for the season.

last Saturday was between South

Finally, the Bruins won, notching
57 points to Troy's 54. It was
