# 54-Highest Yet Against Cards
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
It was a long afternoon.
That wasn't a team from the
YMCA pigmy league which lost
to Southern California; that was
Stanford, and any resemblance
between the Stanford team of
last Saturday and the Stanford
of previous games was purely
horrible.
The game went like the Presiden

tial election. The pollsters predict
ed Southern Cal, but cautioned it
would be close. But Troy, like Ei
senhower, won in a landslide wHh
54 doctoral votes going to USC, 7
j to Stanford.
Actually, the real competition
last Saturday was between South
ern Cal and UCLA. The two were
not cngpftcd in physical contact,
hut they were engaged in a scor
ing battle. Could UCLA run up a
higher total against Oregon State I

than USC could against Stanford?
Finally, the Bruins won, notching
57 points to Troy's 54. It was
Stanford's only solace of Hie af
ternoon.
The 54 points that USC gloatingly
placed on the scoreboard represented
the largest total ever scored against
an Indian team. They've been play
ing football at Stanford since 1802.
The previous high was 49 to 0, made
by Michigan in 1902.
Also, the game marked the fourth
