## Says Resignation Will Help Peace 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y.. Nov.
10 (UP) Trygve Lie announced
today he was resigning as Secre
tary General of the United Na
tions to pave the way for any
possible cease-fire in Korea.
I/ic, who has been boycotted by
Russia and her Communist satel
lites, told a full session of the UN
General Assembly he had planned
resign his $20,000-a-year job as
early as Oct. 14, but waited until to
day so the foreign ministers of the
live 'permanent Security Council
members would be present.
Brig. Gen. Carlos P. Roinulo, Phil
ippines ambassador to the U.S. and
chairman of the Assembly's admin
istrative and budgetary committee,
was considered a good bet as Lie's
successor.
Lie's resignation—a well-guard
ed secret until (bis afternoon's
opening of (lie full General As
scmbly—was met by a stunned si
lence from his listeners.
Taking note of the fact that the
Reds hacl given him the deep freeze
treatment, Lie said the Korean truce
talks had reached the point where
there could be an end to the fight
ing if the Reds really want peace.
In such a ease, he said, a new
Secretary - General approved by
all Big Five powers "may be more
helpful than I."
"I am quite sure that this is the
time to leave without damage to
the UN," Lie told the Assembly,
"and it will be better for the UN if
I do so now."
Lie said he had been boycotted by
Russia and her Communist satel
lites sincc his five-year term was
extended for three more years in
1930.
"I ask you to remember that I
wanted to retire in 1950, at the
end of my five-year term," he
said. "I agreed to carry on only
because the aggression in Korea
created circumstances which put
me under obligation to carry on.
"Now I feel the situation is some
what different. The UN has thrown
back* aggression in Korea. There
can be an armistice if the Soviet
Union, the Chinese People's Repub
lic, and North Korean authorities
are sincere in their wish to end the
fighting."
