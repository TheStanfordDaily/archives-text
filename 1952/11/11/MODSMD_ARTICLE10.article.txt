# OPENING CONCERT
## Bidu Sayao Praised For Gifted Voice 
### DICK MANSFIELD 
A capacity audience in Me
morial Auditorium last night
learned why Bidu Sayao, Metro
politan Opera coloratura so
prano, has won high praise from
critics in this country ever since
her American debut in 1936.
Singing a widely varied program,
Miss Sayao showed excellent con
trol, a mastery of light, whimsical
singing, and a good, round tone in
her middle range.
In the first part of her program,
Miss Sayao sang selections from op
eras by Lully, Handel, and Mozart.
Her voice at first was cold, but
warmed gradually as she sang two
arias from"The Marriage of Figaro"
by Mozart.
In the second portion of her pro
gram, singing short pieces by
French composers, she enunciated
so well that every word could be
heard distinctly all over the house.
The aria "Selva Opaca," from
"William Tell" by Rossini, com
prised the third portion of her pro
gram. After a fine start, Miss Sayao
seemed to swallow her high notes,
and once flatted an entire four-note
figure, but recovered immediately.
She sang two encores at the inter
mission and was presented with a
bouquet of l^ses.
For the fourth section of her pro
gram, Miss Sayao sang six selections
in English, for which she used notes.
These selections were all very good,
although her tone occasionally suf
fered when she lowered her head
to read. Her best performance of
the evening was "The Early Morn
ing" by Graham Peel, a warm tunc
which she treated just right.
Miss Sayao saved a selection of
Brazilian folk songs for her final
section. Heitor Vilia-Lobos was the
composer of two of her selections,
"Bachianas Brasileiras No. 5" and
"Lundu da Marquesa dc Santos." A
native Brazilian, shr seemed at
home singing these selections.
Miss Sayao sang four encorcs at
tl>c end of her performance, includ
ing a short, entertaining bit called
"I Hate Music."
Milne Charnlcy accompanied Miss
Sayao.

warmed gradually as she sang two
arias from"The Marriage of Figaro"
by Mozart.
In the second portion of her pro
gram, singing short pieces by
French composers, she enunciated
so well that every word could be
heard distinctly all over the house.
The aria "Selva Opaca," from
"William Tell" by Rossini, com
prised the third portion of her pro
gram. After a fine start, Miss Sayao
seemed to swallow her high notes,
and once flatted an entire four-note
figure, but recovered immediately.
She sang two encores at the inter
mission and was presented with a
bouquet of l^ses.
For the fourth section of her pro
gram, Miss Sayao sang six selections
in English, for which she used notes.
These selections were all very good,
although her tone occasionally suf
fered when she lowered her head
to read. Her best performance of
the evening was "The Early Morn
ing" by Graham Peel, a warm tunc
which she treated just right.
Miss Sayao saved a selection of
Brazilian folk songs for her final
section. Heitor Vilia-Lobos was the
composer of two of her selections,
"Bachianas Brasileiras No. 5" and
"Lundu da Marquesa dc Santos." A
native Brazilian, shr seemed at
home singing these selections.
Miss Sayao sang four encorcs at
tl>c end of her performance, includ
ing a short, entertaining bit called
"I Hate Music."
Milne Charnlcy accompanied Miss
Sayao.
