# Blood Donors Needed to Fill Campus Quota
## 
### 
"Your Hood is urgently needed
by the men in Korea." This was the
plea made by Korean war veterans
at living groups lai.;l night. At La
gunita, Branner, and the eating
clubs, four Marine veterans from
Oak Knoll Hospital told students
that plasma had saved the lives of
an untold number of wounded sol
diers.
Members of the Student Health
Committee are taking signups today
for appointments to donate blood to
the Red Cross on Thursday and
Friday. To date, only 240 people
have signed up, which is less than
half the quota of 500, and as about
15 to 20 per cent, of these will be
declared ineligible, the signups must
increase if the quota is to be met.
Those who are under 21 are re
quired to have their parents' con
sent on the form provided by the
Red Cross before they will he per
mitted to make an appointment-
Students may sign up at booths set
up in front of the Cellar and in front
of the Main Li be.
1 Students weighing 110 pounds or
more, who have not given blood
within the last three months and
who have not had any recent, immu
nizations, communicable diseases, or
I colds, arc eligible to donate their
j blood.
The I Joel Cross mobile unit will be
| 't. up in front of the Women's
Clubhouse all day Thursday and
on Friday morning to accommodate
' donors. The entire process takes
1 about one hour including time out
for refreshments of coffee and
doughnuts after the donation.
Bill Tocher, chairman of the Stu
j dent .Health Committee, has em
; phasized that there are no adverse
| effects on the blood donor. Any pcr-
J son who might be harmed in any
| foreseeable way is not acccptcd for
j donation.
According to Tocher, past turn-
J outs at Stanford for this event have
been disappointing as compared to
turnouts for similar drives at such
schools as Cal and Harvard. How
ever, it is hoped that this drive will
be more successful.
