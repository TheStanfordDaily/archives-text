## 
### DOROTHY DODGE Editor, The Daily 
(Editor's note: The following is the firs! in a scries of (wo analyses
of (lie pros and eons of the liquor resolution which will appear on (he
hallot in Friday's election. This article deals with the arguments for and
against the idea of lowering the drinking age; the sccond article, which
will appear in tomorrow's Daily, will deal with submitting the idea to
i the State Legislature).
In a special referendum on the ballot in Friday's ASSU final election, the
I student body will be asked to vote on the following resolution:
"The students of Stanford University resolve that, the State of California
j set the minimum legal age for the purchase of beers, ales, and wines con
| taining less than 13 per cent alcohol by volume at eighteen years and pro
l vide persons between the ages of 18 and 21 with non-transferable per
| sonal identification which includes a picturc of the holder.
2. "Do you approve of this idea?"
, 2. "Do you approve of submitting this idea to the state legislature?"
This resolution was originally passed by the 1951 ASSU Excom. follow
; ing al-tion by the State Legislature increasing the penalties possible under
! the present liquor legislation. At that time, the Excom presented the
j following arguments for its stand:
"This resolution is presented by the Executive Committee of the As
sociated Students of Stanford University in the belief that the present
I liquor law in California is unrealistic, and that it is not sound legislation
! because it is unenforceable and consistently violated.
"We are perhaps more nwnrp of this situation than most citizens heean.se

wr are closer to tho problem. We fire doing our best lo sec that the law
is observed, and will continue to do so; but wo believe there could be a
better law.
"Wc urge that the purchase of beers, ales, and wines containing less
than per cent alcohol by volume be made legal for 18-year-olds, be
cause this the age at which good judgment is expected in other phases of
living.
"It is the age, for example, at which young men are eligible for military
service. At this aye a man may marry with his parents' consent and a
woman may marry even without this consent. If he earns more than $500
a year he is not a dependent in the eyes of the law. The state and. fed
eral governments as well as most communities consider an eighteen-year
old an adult who should assume responsibility. Yet the privileges of
adulthood ace withheld.
"Other states. Illinois, New York, Georgia, and North Dakota in
particular, permit the purchase of alcoholic beverages by eighteen-year
olds. There is adequate precedent for adoption of such a law in California.
"As the law exists in California, a parent is forbidden to serve alcoholic
beverages to his minor children even in his own home. Young married
couples under twenty-one may not drink or serve alcoholic beverages in
their homes.
"We feel also that good legislation is that which the citizens them
selves help to enforce. If the privilege of identification cards for beverage
purchase under a reasonable law is granted to young people from 18 to
21. we believe that they will protect that privilege in every way they can.
This vynuld include careful observance <>112 (be law nnH ytTnvk proven*

the sort of traffic in falsified identification that now exists.
"The lure of the forbidden is a strong one. It. leads to excess. The
individual who is free from unrealistic restraints is better able to exercise
mature judgment, and is more aware of his responsibility for his own
actions.
"Wc believe this resolution is a realistic approach to a very real prob
lem created by an artificial law. The present statute docs not help to
develop among California youth a respect for law or mature judgment.
We urge most strongly your serious consideration of the changcs wc
propose.
However, opponents of the resolution put up these arguments:
1. We at Stanford tend to think of the 18-ycar-old as a college stu
dent, but many 18-year-olds are still in high school. 'I'hc maturity of,
18-year-olds who have never been on their own is highly questionable.
2. 'She problem of youthful drivers drinking will be increased.
:i. Drinking in general will increase as persons whom the law kept
temperate will be free to do what they want.
4. Disrespect for the liquor law does not really carry over to other
laws, some argue. Violating the liquor law has been compared to violating
speeding regulations.
5. There are moral arguments that young people should be dis
couraged in every way possible from drinking.
The opponents generally are" concerned about the maturity of the
average 18-year-old. They point, out that the young people who assume
responsibility become mature after they have hold it, but are not mature
when thev start out -it is,
