### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 (UP) —
Sen. Robert A. Taft said today he
would have won the Presidency if
the Republicans had nominated him
and that he would have carried
more GOP Senatorial candidates
with him than Dwight. D. Eisen
hower.
The Senator also said the Demo
crats lost votes with their charges
that Eisenhower "surrendered" to
liini at their Morningside Heights
meeting. Taft said it made his par
tisans campaign harder.
House Republican Leader Joseph
W. Martin, Jr., of Massachusetts in
directly disputed Taft's victory
elairtis. Martin said he is "inclined
to think" that. Eisenhower "is the
only man we could have won with
this year" — although "you can't
know."
Taft and Martin were among
seven political leaders interviewed
by the magazine U.S. News & World
Report on the reasons behind the
Republican victory in last Tuesday's
election.
The others were Gov. Thomas E.
Dewey of New York; Wilson Wyatt,
campaign manager for Gov. Adlai
E. Stevenson; Gov. James F. Byrnes
of South Carolina; Republican Na
tional Chairman Arthur E. Sum
merficld; and Sen. Henry Cabot
Lodge, defeated for re-clection in
Massachusetts.
Just about all of the seven po
litical leaders agreed that the Re
publican victory was the result of
"time for a change" sentiment, and
the Korean war.
