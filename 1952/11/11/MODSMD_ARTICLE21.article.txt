# Roses and Thorns

### 
This morning it's roses and thorns.
The roses go to:
i ; ublic Relations Committee and all the other
people who worked on the recently-released
Activities Booklet. It's a carefu!ly planned,
comprehensive job that should help the activi
ties seeker lind what inteiests him out of the
happy maze of Stanford clubs and corns.
The Institute of International Relations for
their highly successful UNESCO Conference.
The lIR continues, to make one of the largest
contributions to Stanford's good reputation of
any organisation on campus.
K7.SU tor ils precederft-breaking election
co verage and other recent attempts to bring
new lite to campus radio. The station at 880
on your dial shows real promises ol becom
ing an increasingly imjxtrtant part of Stanford
life.
Cardinals, to the Stanford Band, to Rally Com
mittee, to the hundreds of float builders, card
flippers, and pom pom wavers who combined
to make last weekend's Homecoming a roar
ing success. The unusually high guality of the
floats, the extra sparkle shown by the band,

and Rally Corn's hard work made the half time
activities at the game Saturday one of the finest
spectacles we've seen in four years at Stanford.
To everyone whose continuing hospitality
to visitors has prompted many compliments
to us (from a UCLA variety show director who
came here sieking information on Gaieties:
"If the hospitality I received is typical, I'm
sold on your campus." From a USC rooter:
"If you had a good will program, it certainly
was a success.")

On a less pleasant note, we wish to award
large bouguets of thorns to:
The planners of Friday night's rally who fore
got about the obligations of good taste and
made a large portion of their audience very
unhappy.
The students at the San Jose State rally
whose conduct prompted a severely critical
editorial in the college's student newspaper.
To the rooters whose conduct at Saturday's
game did little to uphold the theory that a Stan
ford rooting section is not as crude as Cal's.'

Cardinals, to the Stanford Band, to Rally Com
mittee, to the hundreds of float builders, card
flippers, and pom pom wavers who combined
to make last weekend's Homecoming a roar
ing success. The unusually high guality of the
floats, the extra sparkle shown by the band,

and Rally Corn's hard work made the half time
activities at the game Saturday one of the finest
spectacles we've seen in four years at Stanford.
To everyone whose continuing hospitality
to visitors has prompted many compliments
to us (from a UCLA variety show director who
came here sieking information on Gaieties:
"If the hospitality I received is typical, I'm
sold on your campus." From a USC rooter:
"If you had a good will program, it certainly
was a success.")

On a less pleasant note, we wish to award
large bouguets of thorns to:
The planners of Friday night's rally who fore
got about the obligations of good taste and
made a large portion of their audience very
unhappy.
The students at the San Jose State rally
whose conduct prompted a severely critical
editorial in the college's student newspaper.
To the rooters whose conduct at Saturday's
game did little to uphold the theory that a Stan
ford rooting section is not as crude as Cal's.'
