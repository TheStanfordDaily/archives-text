## From Another Viewpoint 
### EDWARD S. SHAW 
(Editor's note: Dr. Shaw, who heads the Stan -
ford Economics Department, has won wide respect
as a teacher because of his intellect and sincere
interest in his students.)
The editor has not told me so, but I imagine she
does not want contributors to this column to take
up cudgels in Professor Snarf's behalf. The Professor,
after all, has his own primitive methods of retaliation
that Tare very effective though possibly in violation of
Ihe Fundamental Standard.
Still, I do wish to register a mild complaint against
various people, including some students. I regret
that they are not as inquisitive as they might be.
Their sense of curiosity has not matured in pace with
the other senses that go into the makeup of the coni-
I lete student.
May 1 illustrate my point? Few students inquire

into the professional qualifications
<>! their instructors. I concede
that the principle of the buyer
will -please-keep-his-guard-up is
not a part of University ethics.
Nevertheless it is surprising that
the University's cash customers
do n:>t inspect a little more care
fully the quality of their academic
fare, to confirm that the fare is
choice instead of barely good or
super-colossal rather than merely
mammoth.

Here is another illustration. So many students
want (hf "practical" and spurn the "theoretical."
As > yet it, a practical course describes minutely
(he contours of a rut someone is in. This, gentle
men, is an invoice. That other piece of paper is
a hill of lading. The very best people use invoices
hr duplicate and hills of lading in triplicate. Such
choice morsels of piartinil knowledge you may
need some time, when you are in a rut. Until then,
\ ou have exciting opportunities to explore theories.
A theory is a challenge to thought, while practical
thai; . can he delegated to (he thoughtless. Theory

is management's job, but practical things can be done
by machines. Only curious men think theoretically
and enable their fellows to do practical things more
easily, more cheaply, or in more interesting and
fruitful variety. Inquisitive (theoretical) men de
signed the federal Constitution, while practical men
boss wards. Theorists design aircraft that practical
robots will fly.
People who lack curiosity like to settle issues by
rules of thumb or epithets and classify other men by
succinct and careless labels. It means injecting a
personal note—presumably not good form—but I
illustrate this point by reference to the (Moscow)
Literary Gazette of September 27, 1952. Two mem
bers of the (Stanford) Department of Economics are
labeled there as "lackeys of monopoly capitalism."
It may be indiscreet of me to know, or admit know
ing, someone who reads the Literary Gazette.
Perhaps because of such indiscretions the same
two Stanford economists are ticked off as pinks or
even Keynesians by some compatriots. Now pink
is an innocent color, commonly imposed by mothers
on infant daughters, and Lord Keynes did his levef
best according to his lights to save the western world
for capitalists as shrewd in private finance as he.
But in context the words "pink" and "Keynesian"
are not meant to be nice. My point is that neither
(he men who call us lackeys of monopoly capitalism
nor the men who call us pinks (lackeys of social
ism?) are inquisitive men. Both are wrong, because
both see issues and judge men naively, repressing
any curiosity as to what the facts may he.
The inquisitive man profits, by thinking up a new
mousetrap. He enjoys himself, with explosive tests
of some homely theory on his son's chemistry set.
lie establishes interesting relationships with interest
ing people, by not pinning labels on them prema
turely. The most inquisitive men probe and pry into
the mysteries of matter, of mind, and of social or
ganization. When they emerge with a theory that
endures the most merciless tests, they experience a
thrill that practical men cannot sen.se. Check this
with Felix Bloch.
