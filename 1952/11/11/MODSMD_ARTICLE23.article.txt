# BULL SESSION
## 
### BOB STETSON 
.After attending the rally last Friday night. I amM|
very self-conscious about making jokes. If I blush,■■
just act like you don't notice it. 'j'
So instead of being a humor column this issue,
Hull Session will be designed to suggest ways for a jffl
b<11« 1 life at Stanford. Day alter day we #o along \

ridiculing established traditions
and making a joke out of some
very serious things. It is time we
try to advance a few constructive
ideas.
It was once said that ideas are
like beards: men do not have
them until they grow up. I havn't
shaved for three days and I think
everyone agrees I can get idf*as.
(I'm not kissing anyone, but
there's fire in every finger).

Hob Stetson suggests:
1. To save money for the university, men and
women could use the same showers. Since all Stan
ford students are pledged to uphold the Funda
mental Standard, a black line down the shower floor
should be sufficient to retain the fitting degree of
morality. (Suggested to Bob Stetson by Bill Stave,
Stanford first-year man).
li. To leave more time for social life, all courses
should be designed like French 99. This course is
lid hours of individual reading a quarter with a con
ference with the instructor. One could wait until
there arc HG hours left in the quarter before ho needs
to crack a book. (Suggested to Bob Stetson by Bill
Hadley, Stanford first-year man).
3. To make things easier, more women at Stanford
(Suggested to Bob Stetson by Steve Thomas, Stan
ford first-year man).
4. To make it harder to study, even fewer women.
(Suggested to Bob Stetson by a Stanford freshwomali,

name withheld by request).
I hope the above suggestions which I have given
will be of-value to the administration.

My roommate, Alec Gerbode, wanted to take a
shower after Saturday's game (no connection between
this item and the above). Picturesque Encina was
having its open house and sundry members of the
opposite sex were loitering in the halls. My rommate
does not have a bathrobe.
'Hie question: whet her lis nobler in (he minds of
women for one to walk hulls, covered scantily about
the waist with only a towel; or to wrap one's head
thoroughly in said towel, thus concealing one's
identity ami saving one from knowing if anyone saw
one.
I am embarrassed to say which alternative he
chose.
If you will notice, I have a new picture Ibis issue,
Going Joe College, I have a crew cut. But to be really
collegiate, 1 must have horn-rimmed glasses. Un
fortunately rny bedroom eyes are 20/20 all the way.
I find this to be a great hindrance to my collegiate
desires. Perhaps I should buy some plain glass
lenses, horn rimmed, of course, to wear only when
I am not reading. I am trying to decide if girls make
passes at men who wear glasses.
However, we Stanford first-year men are rapidly
finding out that the days when girls made passes
are a part of the past.
Pass the pornographic literature, Joe.

Hob Stetson suggests:
1. To save money for the university, men and
women could use the same showers. Since all Stan
ford students are pledged to uphold the Funda
mental Standard, a black line down the shower floor
should be sufficient to retain the fitting degree of
morality. (Suggested to Bob Stetson by Bill Stave,
Stanford first-year man).
li. To leave more time for social life, all courses
should be designed like French 99. This course is
lid hours of individual reading a quarter with a con
ference with the instructor. One could wait until
there arc HG hours left in the quarter before ho needs
to crack a book. (Suggested to Bob Stetson by Bill
Hadley, Stanford first-year man).
3. To make things easier, more women at Stanford
(Suggested to Bob Stetson by Steve Thomas, Stan
ford first-year man).
4. To make it harder to study, even fewer women.

My roommate, Alec Gerbode, wanted to take a

having its open house and sundry members of the

does not have a bathrobe.

one.

chose.

I find this to be a great hindrance to my collegiate

lenses, horn rimmed, of course, to wear only when
I am not reading. I am trying to decide if girls make
passes at men who wear glasses.
However, we Stanford first-year men are rapidly
finding out that the days when girls made passes
are a part of the past.
