# ASSU Allots $5,500 To Foreign Students
## 
### WIN GRIFFITH 
(Editor's note: This is the last
of two articles on the Foreign
Scholarship Committee and its
work at Stanford.)

The largest single item on this
year's ASSU budget, $5,500, is
devoted to the work of the For
eign Scholarship Committee.
The job of administering the
$5,500 is the responsibility of the 12
members of that committee. Headed
by co-chairmen Garner Beckett and
Don Price, they organize the dozens
of yearly applications by foreign
students for final selection by the
administration and the living
groups, arrange transportation and
housing for the scholars, and con
duct a continuous campaign to in
terest other American universities
in adopting similar foreign scholar
ship programs.
Members of the committee be
lieve that the effectiveness of the
program cannot be fully realized

until it is adopted by at least a
dozen American universities. UC
LA is currently organizing a for
eign scholar plan, and next spring
quarter the Stanford committee
plans a "concentrated effort to
publicize the program to othcv
universities."
Meanwhile eo - chairmen Beckett

and Price are concerned with the
activities of the eight foreign schol-

ars at Stanford on the 1952-53 pro
gram.
Is the program a success? In
the past four years, 34 foreign
students who otherwise could not *
have studied in the United States
have attended Stanford. Their
careers have been conditioned by
their "American experience," and
the hundreds of Stanford students
who met and talked with them
have been able to increase their
knowledge of a world which lies
beyond the ski slopes of the Sier
ras and the beaches of the Cali
fornia coast.
Other long - range goals of the
program cannot yet be measured as
having succeeded or failed. The
program is young at Stanford. It is
only an "idea" at other universities.
Foreign Scholar Committee mem
bers are enthusiastic enough in
their belief in the program's ulti
mate success to spend many hours
each week working in their office in
the Union. They hope and believe
that other American universities
will become equally enthusiastic,
and that the cumulative efforts of
American college students will be
come that "potent force for world
peace" mentioned by the first For
eign Scholarship Committee chair
man in 1948.

duct a continuous campaign to in
terest other American universities
in adopting similar foreign scholar
ship programs.
Members of the committee be
lieve that the effectiveness of the
program cannot be fully realized

until it is adopted by at least a
dozen American universities. UC
LA is currently organizing a for
eign scholar plan, and next spring
quarter the Stanford committee
plans a "concentrated effort to
publicize the program to othcv
universities."
Meanwhile eo - chairmen Beckett

and Price are concerned with the
activities of the eight foreign schol-

ars at Stanford on the 1952-53 pro
gram.
Is the program a success? In
the past four years, 34 foreign
students who otherwise could not *
have studied in the United States
have attended Stanford. Their
careers have been conditioned by
their "American experience," and
the hundreds of Stanford students
who met and talked with them
have been able to increase their
knowledge of a world which lies
beyond the ski slopes of the Sier
ras and the beaches of the Cali
fornia coast.
Other long - range goals of the
program cannot yet be measured as
having succeeded or failed. The
program is young at Stanford. It is
only an "idea" at other universities.
Foreign Scholar Committee mem
bers are enthusiastic enough in
their belief in the program's ulti
mate success to spend many hours
each week working in their office in
the Union. They hope and believe
that other American universities
will become equally enthusiastic,
and that the cumulative efforts of
American college students will be
come that "potent force for world
peace" mentioned by the first For
eign Scholarship Committee chair
man in 1948.

(Editor's note: This is the last
of two articles on the Foreign
Scholarship Committee and its
work at Stanford.)

The largest single item on this
year's ASSU budget, $5,500, is
devoted to the work of the For
eign Scholarship Committee.
The job of administering the
$5,500 is the responsibility of the 12
members of that committee. Headed
by co-chairmen Garner Beckett and
Don Price, they organize the dozens
of yearly applications by foreign
students for final selection by the
administration and the living
groups, arrange transportation and
housing for the scholars, and con
duct a continuous campaign to in
terest other American universities
in adopting similar foreign scholar
ship programs.
