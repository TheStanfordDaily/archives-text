We invite your attention to the picture in this column, taken by Daily
photog Fred Chez.
It shows Trojan offensive end Tim Niekoloff deliberately sticking his
foot between half Dick Monteith's legs in order to trip him. The zebra
shirts issued no penalty for this infraction of the rules, as was the case
many other times on that long Saturday afternoon.
USC'.s dirtiness was obvious. Bob Mathias took the ball around end
in the third quarter and was knocked out of bounds. Whereupon two other
USC tacklers pounced on him, one managing to knee him in the back.
Hub Mathias injured his back on that play and there is a possibility he
may miss next Saturday's game*. Troy's policy of "get Mathias out of
there" succeeded.
Dick Horn, the great defensive back on last year's squad, told us after
the game, "There was simply no excuse for the things they did. especially

when they were so far 'ahead. I saw more knees in' the backs alter the
tackle had been made than I can count on my fingers.
Other cases of dirtiness were obvious . . . linebacker Timberlake
squashing his hand in Skip Crist's face after he was down, half Dick Nunis
bumping Mathius after he was two yards out of bounds. Bob Garrett getting
.smashed after he had thrown the ball, ad infinitum. Reierees Sprenger,
Nicker,sen, Fleming. Brown, and Fitzpatrick missed about as many in
li actions as Stanford missed tackles and blocks.
There Is a boundary, line between rough and dirty football. Rough
football is desirable. There is no excuse for dirty football, especially when
you're as far ahead as the Trojans were.
If Mr, Gallup were to take a poll right now among the first 44 players
on the Stanford football team as to whether they would rather see USC or
(JCLA go to the Rose Bowl. I think he would find 44 "nays'" for USC!
And I think a few of the rooters would concur.

There \Cas something we liked at the ending of last Saturday's game.
Stanford, slightly past the stage of rigor mortis, had gone down to its
most humiliating defeat. And yet at the end of the game, the rooting
section gave the Chuck Taylor yell and the Stanford Hymn as enthusiastic
treatment as I've heard all year.
Compare this with the actions of the USC rooting section in last year's
27 to 20 Stanford triumph. The band walked out with its tail between its
legs and the Trojan rooters didn't even sing their alma mater.

squashing his hand in Skip Crist's face after he was down, half Dick Nunis

Nicker,sen, Fleming. Brown, and Fitzpatrick missed about as many in

There Is a boundary, line between rough and dirty football. Rough
football is desirable. There is no excuse for dirty football, especially when
you're as far ahead as the Trojans were.
If Mr, Gallup were to take a poll right now among the first 44 players
on the Stanford football team as to whether they would rather see USC or
(JCLA go to the Rose Bowl. I think he would find 44 "nays'" for USC!
And I think a few of the rooters would concur.

There \Cas something we liked at the ending of last Saturday's game.
Stanford, slightly past the stage of rigor mortis, had gone down to its
most humiliating defeat. And yet at the end of the game, the rooting
section gave the Chuck Taylor yell and the Stanford Hymn as enthusiastic
treatment as I've heard all year.
Compare this with the actions of the USC rooting section in last year's
27 to 20 Stanford triumph. The band walked out with its tail between its
legs and the Trojan rooters didn't even sing their alma mater.

We invite your attention to the picture in this column, taken by Daily
photog Fred Chez.
It shows Trojan offensive end Tim Niekoloff deliberately sticking his
foot between half Dick Monteith's legs in order to trip him. The zebra
shirts issued no penalty for this infraction of the rules, as was the case
many other times on that long Saturday afternoon.
USC'.s dirtiness was obvious. Bob Mathias took the ball around end
in the third quarter and was knocked out of bounds. Whereupon two other
USC tacklers pounced on him, one managing to knee him in the back.
Hub Mathias injured his back on that play and there is a possibility he
may miss next Saturday's game*. Troy's policy of "get Mathias out of
there" succeeded.
Dick Horn, the great defensive back on last year's squad, told us after
the game, "There was simply no excuse for the things they did. especially

when they were so far 'ahead. I saw more knees in' the backs alter the
tackle had been made than I can count on my fingers.
