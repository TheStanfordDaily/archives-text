# SIDELINED FOR OREGON CAL
## Bob Garrett Is Out for Season 
### DON WEBSTER 
Bob Garrett, Stanford's ace
quarterback, was reported out
for the remainder of the season
/esterday, following an injury
ncurred in last week's USC
game. Jack Gebert is slated to
start Saturday.
Dr. Stanley Lourcleaux, team phy
i sician, .said that the shoulder sepa
ration suffered in the first half of

! Saturday's game is worse than ori-
( ginally hoped. An operation is
j scheduled for tomorrow.
' Garrett, a junior, has been the
I .
Indians' first - string quarterback
j since the graduation of Gary Ker
kofian last season. Until the Trojan
game, he had played all but a few
j minutes at Stanford's quarterback
ing position. Gebert saw his first

real action Saturday, as he went the
entire second half following Gar
rett's injury.
Meanwhile, the varsity staged a
routine practice yesterday, un
aware until after the sivimmuge
was over of the injury to their
quarterback.
Garrett's loss might have been a
great deal more serious had it oc
curred before the USC game. Geb
ert gained both experience and con
fidence in that tilt, completing eight
passes in 18 attempts, for a total of
87 yards. Moving to second-string
quarterback is Mike Acker.
Two other players remain doubt
ful for this week's Oregon contest.
Bob Hoegh and Ron Cook both have
leg injuries, and it will not be
known until later in the week
whether or not they will see ac
tion. Trainer Connie Jarvis ex
pressed doubt that Hoegh would
play, saying that they will probably
hold him out a week in order for
him to be at full speed for the Big
Game.
Needless to say, Coach Chuck
Taylor was dismayed over the
news of Garrett's injury. "Kol> has
been playing fine ball for us all
season," he said. "This is one of
those things you can't anticipate,
and we will simply have to do our
best without him.
"However, we think Jack Gebert
should do a fine job filling in for
Garrett, judging on his performance
Saturday. We do look, though, for
Bob to come back and have a fine
season next year."

Bob Garrett, Stanford's ace
quarterback, was reported out
for the remainder of the season
/esterday, following an injury
ncurred in last week's USC
game. Jack Gebert is slated to
start Saturday.
Dr. Stanley Lourcleaux, team phy
i sician, .said that the shoulder sepa
ration suffered in the first half of

! Saturday's game is worse than ori-
( ginally hoped. An operation is
j scheduled for tomorrow.
' Garrett, a junior, has been the
I .
Indians' first - string quarterback
j since the graduation of Gary Ker
kofian last season. Until the Trojan
game, he had played all but a few
j minutes at Stanford's quarterback
ing position. Gebert saw his first

real action Saturday, as he went the
entire second half following Gar
rett's injury.
Meanwhile, the varsity staged a
routine practice yesterday, un
aware until after the sivimmuge
was over of the injury to their
quarterback.
Garrett's loss might have been a
great deal more serious had it oc
curred before the USC game. Geb
ert gained both experience and con
fidence in that tilt, completing eight
passes in 18 attempts, for a total of
87 yards. Moving to second-string
quarterback is Mike Acker.
Two other players remain doubt
ful for this week's Oregon contest.
Bob Hoegh and Ron Cook both have
leg injuries, and it will not be
known until later in the week
whether or not they will see ac
tion. Trainer Connie Jarvis ex
pressed doubt that Hoegh would
play, saying that they will probably
hold him out a week in order for
him to be at full speed for the Big
Game.
Needless to say, Coach Chuck
Taylor was dismayed over the
news of Garrett's injury. "Kol> has
been playing fine ball for us all
season," he said. "This is one of
those things you can't anticipate,
and we will simply have to do our
best without him.
"However, we think Jack Gebert
should do a fine job filling in for
Garrett, judging on his performance
Saturday. We do look, though, for
Bob to come back and have a fine
season next year."
