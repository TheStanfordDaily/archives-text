TOKYO, Tuesday, Nov. 11 (UP) —
Allied infantrymen smashed back an
attack by 800 win-or-die Chinese on
the western front's Porkchop Hill
eatiy today in bloody hand-to-hand
fighting.
At least 100 Reds were killed.
Their bodies were counted on the
frozen slopes of the important hill
northwest of Yonchon when dawn
broke.
United Nations troops fought, the
Communists with fists, knives, and
rifle butts in the network of tunnels
and bunkers on top of Porkchop
from 11:150 p.m. Monday until the
beaten Chinese fell back at. 4:05 a.m.
today (2:05 p.m. EST Monday).
"They outnumbered us but out
guys did a wonderful job," a UN
battalion officer said.
The Red assault was backed by
.1,500 rounds of artillery and mortar.
The Chinese, screaming "Kill! Kill!"
first swarmed to the crcst in 200-
man strength at 1 a.m. but were
driven off.
The attack on Porkchop swung ac
tion on the 155-mile front back to
the west after United Nations troops
at the extreme eastern end of the
line recaptured Anchor Hill from
1,000 Communists of the revitalized
North Korean army.
