AUGUSTA, Nov. 11 (UP)
President olocl Dwicfhl D. F!i-
Bonhowei probably will turn up
in the Korean war theater with
out further public notice of his
proposod visit, it was learned
here today.
Il whs believed lir will ho with
the troop:, in Korea <>n Thanksgiv
ing,
For obvious security reasons, no
I imp-table r>f the trip will be made
public. And there will be no ad
vance notice given where or when
the former general will go into the
theater.
There has been speculation at tlie
Kiscnhower vacation headquarters
here that the Republican winner
will leave for Korea shortly after
his talks next week in Washington
with President Truman, but in view
of the light security being clamped
on the trip, there will probably be
no definite word until he actually
arrives.
The general was unmoved by
statements from various Republican
Senators and leaders, including for
mer GOP Presidential candidate Alf
M. Landon, that he should not risk
going to Korea. But these state
ments undoubtedly increased his
determination to take every kind of
precaution.


YOU DON'T SAY—President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower seems
to be surprised at what Brig. Gen. Frank Allen (right), command
ant of Camp Gordon, had to say as he greeted him at Augusta,
Ga. Ike is spending a short vacation near Augusta.
