# An Adequate Cross-section
## 
### 
Once again complaints are being heard that
Stanford does not have an adequate cross-sec
tion of racial groups. Many people feel that
both Stanford and its prospective students are
losing out with the overwhelming "free, white,
and 21" situation which now exists.
The complaints have come up in The Daily' 3
"Campus Opinion" and even in an Excom dis
cussion. Generally, the fear has been ex
pressed that Stanford discriminates against non
white groups in its entrance requirements.
Specifically, criticism has been levelled against
the pictures required with application blanks.
The charges of discrimination have no basis
in fact. The Administration follows the policy
that any student who can meet the Univer
sity's scholastic, activity, and character re
quirements —and who is financially able to
pay the tuition—may come to Stanford, re
gardless of "race, color, or creed."
The pictures are used as an aid to the coun
selors who have interviewed prospective en
trants. Seeing a photo often helps the counselor
remember the persons he has talked If the

student is accepted, the picture helps the spon
sor and residence director to recognize and wel
come him when he arrives at Stanford.
If there is no discrimination, then why don't
the members of more minority groups attend
the University? There are two probable an
swers: lack of information and lack of funds.
Something can be done about both of these.
It has been suggested that the Axe Society or
some comparable group provide student
speakers to tell their home town high schools
about Stanford. These speakers could make
a special effort to visit the high schools which
are not now sending students to Stanford.
The organizations which are particularly in
terested in bringing minority groups to Stanford
can also help. Sponsoring scholarships would
be an excellent way for these organizations to
do something concrete about the problem.
We feel that discriminating toward minority
groups is as bad as discriminating against
them, but in this case it seems that interested
organizations could well do something to make
the situation more equitable.
