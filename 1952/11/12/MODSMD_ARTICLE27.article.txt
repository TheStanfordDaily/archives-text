### PETE GROTHE 
MOVIES VS. REAL LIFE
Things always happen two ways . . . the way they
occur in the movies and the way they happen in real
life. Take, for example, halftime at a football game.
In real life, Chuck. Taylor gets his men in the dress
ing room, tells them to get the weight off their feet,
;-nd pulls out the blackboard.

He points out weaknesses in the
opposition defense, suggests that
the "39 fire" will work in the
second half, and tells individual
team members how they can im
prove.
That's the way it happens in
leal life. Now, if MGM came to
Stanford, the same scene would
appear the following way on the
screen:
Forty-four "beautiful pom pom

pirls run in the dressing room at the conclusion of the
Half and sing, "Sons of the Stanford Red." This is
the cue for Skip Crist to get up and say, "Gee. thanks,
giils. You don't know how much that meant to us.
1 think I speak for the rest of the team when I say
that song has inspired us to go out and win! How
about it, gang?"
"Right you are, Skip!" they chorus.
The girls leave, and Chuck Taylor (played by
Errol Flynn) says in a quavering voice, "Okay,
gang, this is IT! Yesterday, a gambler came up to
me and said he'd rub me out if I didn't throw the

game. I told him. 'No, I don't cave for my own life
or for the lives of my family. It's the old alma mater
that counts'."
"Here, here," say the assistant coaches (played by
Van Johnson, Spencer Tracy, Clark Gable, and Kirk
Douglas).
"And so," Chuck cpntinues, dabbing a technicolor
hankerchief with a red "S" to his eye, "this is prob
ably my last game."
"No," protests trainer Connie Jarvis, who has just
finished removing five cartileges and a fibula from
Hon Eadie's leg so that he can play the second half.
"Yes, I'm afraid this is my last game. And now,
gang, before we go out lor the second half, grant me
one last favor. Sing that Stanford pep song the way
you always sing it."
There just happens to he a piano in the dressing
room, at which Sam INlorley (played by Jose Iturbi)
sits down. From nowhere a full symphony or
chestra strikes up, and team members, each holding
his helmet by his heart, sing it) a manner to put
I'red Waring to shame.
Immediately upon the conclusion of the song, Len
Kaprelian and John Steinberg break into a song and
dance routine, tap dancing over the lockers and
ricocheting off walls.
Taylor, hearing the. knock of the referee on the
door, booms, "Okay, fellows, go out there and fight,
fight, fight. Give 'em heck!"
It should be mentioned that Stanford wins 21 to 20
in the last Uvo seconds of the game on a 103 yard
run from scrimmage by a fourth string guard.
