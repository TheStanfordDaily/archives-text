# CAMPUS OPINION
## An Answer 
### 
(Editor's note: In The Daily, Oct. 30, Mrs. Mc-
Mullin said, "The Stanford rooting section's . . .
wild toss of the cards at the Stevenson stunt was
not non-partisan. (Neither was the Boston Tea
Party) . . . hut bleacher alumni shook hands on
its spirit." In the Daily, Nov. 3, Thorpe accused
Mrs. McMullin of "inconsistency," asking "Would
she accuse Tom Paine of 'me-too-isni' because he
did not originate the American Revolution. Is it
not inconsistent, also to wave the Hag of non
partisanship at Stanford, and then congratulate the
actions of the 'bleacher-alumni'?" The following
is Mrs. McMuIlin's answer.)
To the Editor:
Sitting out the election-returns on E-Day, I com
posed an answer to Mr. Hanson and Mr. Thorpe, your
correspondents who entered my political precinct, so
to speak—Mr. Thorpe with questions. Public political
comment is out now when the Daily, like the nation,
has closed ranks. Mr. Hanson and Mr. Thorpe have
their answers personally—not in print. (No one has
to read letters from strangers). One <ti Mr. Thorpe's
questions, however, concerns somewhat the place of
alumni in Stanford Family life, and is always per
tinent. Since a lady likes to know something about
a stranger she answers in print, if only bis probable
age, I looked, him up. Not finding him, I resorted
to Information. If it and I got the right Mr. Thorpe
and I am not talking—oh gosh!—to a professor, he is
"late lower division." I feel free to call him John.
No, John. I don't feel alumni by shaking hands
on the bleachers, when rooters—apparently pro
testing faculty political action in terms of their em
ployment—balked at a Stevenson card-stunt, were
also involving their Stanford in partisanship. No
alumni—on bleachers, at home, at work, on the
telephone, in committee or bull-session—speak f«;r
Stanford. Only Stanford's President properly speaks
for her, since he guards her academic freedom,
since he carries the responsibility for her course
and character. I think we are fortunate—ours holds
himself, and Stanford, above partisan politics in
her name.
Alumni, however, may share in concern for your
rights, John—yours and your mates—to academic
freedom in your education. We would want no
breath of suspicion on your part that your learning
might be slanted or colored or outright steered by
partisanship. We would want no proof of il either.
We want your experience (usually your last one) of
academic men to bring your reverence for the true
teaching scholar—humble, wise, stimulating to your
mind, developing to your judgment, expert of truth
in his own field, inquirer in other fields. We want
you to know his personal convictions (of race, of
religion, of politics) only from private friendship (if
you are lucky.) Never from his classroom teaching.
This is your time to learn "how to think, not what
to think." To find out that the greatest human thing
in the world is character, that minds are the hands
of service. We want you—a Stanford man or woman—
to make your code and your standards here and
yourself an individual, thinking and judging and act
ing for himself, responsible and free. May you find
your Stanford so!

I
My thanks to the Daily for many courtesies and
patience. The national issue settled, I will not draw
on these again.

partisanship at Stanford, and then congratulate the
actions of the 'bleacher-alumni'?" The following
is Mrs. McMuIlin's answer.)
To the Editor:
Sitting out the election-returns on E-Day, I com
posed an answer to Mr. Hanson and Mr. Thorpe, your
correspondents who entered my political precinct, so
to speak—Mr. Thorpe with questions. Public political
comment is out now when the Daily, like the nation,
has closed ranks. Mr. Hanson and Mr. Thorpe have
their answers personally—not in print. (No one has
to read letters from strangers). One <ti Mr. Thorpe's
questions, however, concerns somewhat the place of
alumni in Stanford Family life, and is always per
tinent. Since a lady likes to know something about
a stranger she answers in print, if only bis probable
age, I looked, him up. Not finding him, I resorted
to Information. If it and I got the right Mr. Thorpe
and I am not talking—oh gosh!—to a professor, he is
"late lower division." I feel free to call him John.
No, John. I don't feel alumni by shaking hands
on the bleachers, when rooters—apparently pro
testing faculty political action in terms of their em
ployment—balked at a Stevenson card-stunt, were
also involving their Stanford in partisanship. No
alumni—on bleachers, at home, at work, on the
telephone, in committee or bull-session—speak f«;r
Stanford. Only Stanford's President properly speaks
for her, since he guards her academic freedom,
since he carries the responsibility for her course
and character. I think we are fortunate—ours holds
himself, and Stanford, above partisan politics in
her name.
Alumni, however, may share in concern for your
rights, John—yours and your mates—to academic
freedom in your education. We would want no
breath of suspicion on your part that your learning
might be slanted or colored or outright steered by
partisanship. We would want no proof of il either.
We want your experience (usually your last one) of
academic men to bring your reverence for the true
teaching scholar—humble, wise, stimulating to your
mind, developing to your judgment, expert of truth
in his own field, inquirer in other fields. We want
you to know his personal convictions (of race, of
religion, of politics) only from private friendship (if
you are lucky.) Never from his classroom teaching.
This is your time to learn "how to think, not what
to think." To find out that the greatest human thing
in the world is character, that minds are the hands
of service. We want you—a Stanford man or woman—
to make your code and your standards here and
yourself an individual, thinking and judging and act
ing for himself, responsible and free. May you find
your Stanford so!

I
My thanks to the Daily for many courtesies and
patience. The national issue settled, I will not draw
on these again.
