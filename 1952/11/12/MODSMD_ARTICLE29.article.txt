# On Supreme Court

To the Editor:
In all the excitement of the last week of the elec
tion campaign an important act by the United States
Supreme Court went almost unnoticed. The high
court, voted eight to one against reviewing the case
of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. This is the couple that
was convicted of selling an atomic secret to the
Soviet Union.
The sentence given the Rosenbergs was death.
This is the first time in United States history that
the death penalty has been given by a civil court for
espionage. The sentence is extremely harsh when
compared with fourteen years in prison given the
confessed atom spy and British scientist, Klaus Fuchs.
While maintaining complete innocence of the crime,
the Rosenbergs, mother and father of two young
children, were given the death sentence. The fact
that the United States and the Soviet Union were
allies at the time of the crime should be borne in
mind.
A second attempt is being made at present to ob
tain a review of this case by the Supreme Court.
Because of the extreme severity of this unprecedented
sentence, I urge all to write President Truman asking
him to commute the sentence and to recommend that
the Supreme Court review this case. There is clearly
no time for delay in this matter.
