## Students Offer Funds As Daily Goes Broke 
### SUE WHEAT Daily Exchange Editor 
NORTHWESTERN Students in
Evanston, Illinois, recently woke up
to read three-inch headlines in their
school paper: "THE DAILY IS GO
ING BROKE!" Last year the paper
lost over $4,000 and this year it was
heading for a comparable deficit.
In response to an SOS for funds,
NU students, faculty, and alumni
came forth with $2,000. This was
evidently not enough to keep the
Daily, going on a regular basis,
though, for now the paper has
dropped to three issues a week.
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN—

dropped to three issues a week.
