'USC Plays Ball for Fun'
We found little amusing during the game Saturday but our chat with
Trojan coach Jess Hill in the dressing room was as entertaining as the
finest Hollywood production and as well done by Hill who certainly de
serves an Oscar for his performance.
Mr. Hill obviously a- polished speaker and very cute with his words
amazed us with one answer above all others. Mike Hudson who was
covering the Troy dressing room for Monday's Daily asked the mentor
if there had been any thought of revenge in the Trojan shellacking be
cause of the heartbreaking defeat the Indians handed USC in the Coliseum
last year.
Mr. Hill assuming an attitude of extreme holiness, replied, "MY
BOY. AT USC WE PLAY FOOTBALL FOR FUN. The boys played good
football out there today because they love the jjanie."
Hill became masterful when asked if he knew that the score was
mounting and was he aware that this was the worst licking in the history
of the rivalry. Jess simply smiled and told the press that he didn't even
know the score, just that USC was well ahead. And why did he put in
his regular defensive unit when Stanford was driving for her lone score?
"My boys needed the work. After all we have three tough games, Washing
ton. UCLA and Notre Dame on tap and I have to have my defense ready."
They convinced us early in the game when Stanford could do nothing
that Hill's defense was tops and ready for anyone. We don't blame Hill
for letting his offense break loose. They have done nothing all year and
were being blasted for their inability. But when a team has a 47-o advan
tage and a beaten team Is driving for its lone score, to rush back the first
defehsive unit to stop the points, that doesn't sound like football lor fun.
f[ Wasn't a Dirty Game
However not fpr a minute do we think USC was a dirty team. They
were aggressive, rough, tough and played for keeps, but they were not
dirty. There is question as to where agressiveness becomes over-aggressive
ness and then turns to dirty football. It's difficult to draw the line but in
our way of thinking SC stayed well within the lines of clean ball Saturday.
There were one or two questionable plays but a game doesn't go by where
some of these don't develop regardless of what teams are playing.
The SC team that Stanford beat last year was accused by the local
press of being dirty primarily because one Pat Cannamela supposedly gave
an extra twist to California's John Olszewski in the Bear game which side
lined the star. As a result Stanford went down south expecting a dirty
game and instead staggered home a winner in as rough and tough but
clean ball game as you could find.
We feel such accusations are unwarranted. A twisted knee can occur
in any football game against anyone. W r e recall in 1948 when on the
kickoff of the Big Game Stanford quarterback Don Campbell suffered a
concussion and was carried from the field. The Stanford rooting section,
in an organized yell burst forth with "An eye for an eye and a tooth
for a tooth." This was Stanford accusing Cal of being dirty. Movies
showed the play as accidental as could be.
In any game where tension is high and a star player is sidelined, shouts
of dirty play arise. We feel that dirty play is slight and when it occurs
it is the result of individuals, not a team effort and rarely if ever coaching
policy.
We must go along with the opinion of a lady friend from USC who after
Saturday's game told us that USC does not play dirty. Rather they play
the game to the hilt and that means rough and tough and aggressive.
After all she explained "If coast teams play touch and go ball
will beat an aggressive Big Ten team in the Rose Bowl. Hill doesn't deny
for a moment that his boys are aggressive and instructed to be so. But he
adds and we think he means it that they are not dirty. And with the
exception of a USC basketball team last year which deserved all the
criticism for its style of "nasty" play, we feel that there is too much talk
of dirty athletic teams and not enough praise for the hard hitting, rough,
tough aggressive units, such as USC was Saturday. %
What About the Bowl Decider?
And what about the Rose Bowl decider between USC and UCLA on
Nov. 22? We have seen UCLA twice, USC once and perhaps have no basis
for decision. But with apologies to our lady friend from USC we must go
along with the Bruins. UCLA seems to be the better balanced ball club,
top notch on defense and capable of generating a terrific offense. USC has
a proven defense which might shade that of the Westwooders, but we are
not convinced that the USC offense proved much of anything Saturday
except the nonexistence of a Stanford pass defense. Another factor in
UCLA's favor is that the Bruins don't have anything to do for the next
ten days but concentrate on the Trojans. They don't play Saturday. USC
must get over Washington Saturday before they can even start thinking
out loud of whipping the Bruins.
