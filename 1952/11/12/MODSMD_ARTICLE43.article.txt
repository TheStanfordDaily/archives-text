## Three More Are Injured 
### DON WEBSTER 
Stanford's football hopes suffered
another jolt yesterday as Bob Hoegh
was ruled definitely out of Satur
day's Oregon game, and Skip Crist
and Ron Cook were ruled "highl\
doubtful" starters by trainer Con
nie Jarvis.
Hoegh, suffering from a leg injury,
has been doubtful all week, but
should be back in time for the Bit-
Game. Crist, who suffered a brain
concussion in the same play that
broke his nose, has been bedridden
the past few days, and will not re
port for practice until Thursday and
quite probably will not see action
against the Ducks.
Cook, who has a knee injury, was
alto pronounced doubtful. The trio
of injuries was the crowning touch
to the news that quarter
back Bob.Garrett > not see any
more action this year.
Chuck Taylor put his charges
through another hard scrimmage
yesterday in preparation for the
Ducks. The stress in practice was
both on offense and on pass defense.
Taylor will probably start Chuck
Brazel and Bill Rogers at the half
back spots if Crist and Cook are
unable to play.
