# SAE Takes Mural Win
## 
### RUSS WILKS 
SAE I moved into a second-place
tie with Sigma Nu as a result of its
15 to 0 victory over a spirited Theta
Xi seven in intramural football ac
tion yesterday.
SAE scored the first time it got its
hands,on the ball when Clayton Mc-
Gill engineered a 40-yard drive. He
passed twice to Gene Katnick for 20
yards, ran eight, and then connect
ed with Fred Nelson in the end
zone. McGill tossed to Jake Jacobs
for the extra point.
An errant pass from center that
went out of the end zone credited
the winners with two more points
and the McGill-Nelson combination
registered another score three min
utes before the end of the game on
an 18 - yard play for insurance
points.
The scrappy line play of Nelson
and Eric Henson kept the Xi of
fense in check as the losers com
pleted only two passes and gained
six yards on the ground.
Theta Chi remained undefeated
and unscored upon as it had trouble
defeating previously unbeaten En
cina 2W 11, 20-0. Fred Chez paced
the Division 4 leaders as he passed
for three touchdowns, hitting Gene
Dils twice and Creighton Mills once.
Chez passed to Dils and Warren
Emerson for the extra points.
Other results of the day, which
saw five shutouts posted in six
games, had Toyon 2 tripping Toy on
1, 6-0; Encina 3W topping Encina
4W, 21-6; Encina 2W I gaining its
first victory of the year by defeat
ing Encina lE, 12-0; Phi Delt II
smashing Village 308, 40-0; and El
Campo gaining a forfeit win over
