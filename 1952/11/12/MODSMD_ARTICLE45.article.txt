## Troy Beating Hard to Take 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 10 (UP)
—Coach Chuck Taylor of Stanford
University today termed the 54-7
beating his club took •at the hands
of an inspired Southern California
team on Saturday as a "hard thing
to tiike'' but all part of the game.
"Southern California has a bunch
of tough, determined boys. Any
body that can run 54 points must be
that way.
"I do not know if they could have
held the score down if they had
tried. Hill used every man on his
bench. However, 1 wondered a little
there a few times when he kept
Sears and the other fellows throw
ing those passes for touchdowns in
the last quarter."
Taylor made the statement at the
meeting of the Northern California
Football Writers' Association lunch
eon.
Asked if he would run up a big
score on Southern Cal if he ever got
the chance, Taylor said:
"That's something I don't ever
think about because I know we'll
never have the chance."
