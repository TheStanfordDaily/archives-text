# KZSU—--Never Been on the Air
## 
### DICK MANSFIELD 
KZSU, Stanford's own radio
station, has been broadcasting
for five years, but it has never
actually been on the air. Over
at the KZSU studios, in the Me
mo r i a 1 Audilprium building,
they explain this by using the
term "carrier current broadcast
ing."
"The idea is that the radio signal
tfcts to your radio through the same
wire the power does," Fred Krock,
KZSU's chief engineer, elaborates.
"FCC regulations permit us to send
our signals by wire, if we keep the
power down to certain limits."
The F c d e r a 1 Communications
Commission, under an act passed
in 1!).'I8 to permit radio control of
door locks and similar gadgets, al
lows collcgc broadcasters to do
their transmitting by wire instead
of "over the air waves."
Carrier current stations are regis
tered with the FCC, but their fre
quencies are not protected. A new
regular broadcasting station on the
Peninsula could choose 880 kilocy
cles, KZSU's frequency, and KZSU,
to avoid interference, would have to
change its frequency. The call let
ters KZSU are protected, however.

Carrier current broadcasting has
been widely used only on college
■campuses.
KZSU has wires laid all over
campus for its broadcasts. Trans
mission lines connect the central
studios with transmitters in En
cina Hall, Union, and Lagunita. A
transmitter in the Village receives

signals over a leased telephone j
line.
"Remote lines" arc laid to various I
key locations on campus so that on- i
the - spot broadcasts can be made '
from these points. Chief engineer
Krock estimates 20,000 feet of trans- j
mission line on campus—"and that's
a very conservative estimate."
Krock runs the technical side of
KZSU from an open cubbyhole
("my office") in the basement of the
Speech and Drama section of Me
morial Auditorium building. Just
around the corner is KZSU's main
office, where Station Manager Joan
Coldren supervises all KZSU func
tions. The main broadcasting studio :
is upstairs on the second floor.
"We have a strictly commercial j
setup here," Krock says. "KZSU j
doesn't come under ASSU, and we I
have a regular budget from the Uni- I
versity. Profits theoretically go to •
the University, but we seldom have |
any profits."
KZSU was set up on an experi
mental basis in 1047, with a grant
from the University of $1,400. At
the end of the six-month trial pc- j
riod, the station was doing well j
and was established as a per ma- j
nent department of the Univer
sity, later being assimilated into

; the Speech and Drama Depart
! nient. KZSU is unique in being
an extracurricular activity not
under the jurisdiction of ASSU.
"Wc can originate any kind of
broadcast," Krock says. "We can
originate broadcasts almost any-
I where on campus, using our remote
lines, so if we needed live orchestra
effects, we could go somewhere
where we had room." The main
studio is small. "The acoustics up
there slightly resemble the inside
| of a Coke bottle," Krock adds.

transmitters. —Daily photo by Verne Dunn

I where on campus, using our remote

KZSU, Stanford's own radio
station, has been broadcasting
for five years, but it has never
actually been on the air. Over
at the KZSU studios, in the Me
mo r i a 1 Audilprium building,
they explain this by using the
term "carrier current broadcast
ing."
"The idea is that the radio signal
tfcts to your radio through the same
wire the power does," Fred Krock,
KZSU's chief engineer, elaborates.
"FCC regulations permit us to send
our signals by wire, if we keep the
power down to certain limits."
The F c d e r a 1 Communications
Commission, under an act passed
in 1!).'I8 to permit radio control of
door locks and similar gadgets, al
lows collcgc broadcasters to do
their transmitting by wire instead
of "over the air waves."
Carrier current stations are regis
tered with the FCC, but their fre
quencies are not protected. A new
regular broadcasting station on the
Peninsula could choose 880 kilocy
cles, KZSU's frequency, and KZSU,
to avoid interference, would have to
change its frequency. The call let
ters KZSU are protected, however.

Carrier current broadcasting has
been widely used only on college
■campuses.
KZSU has wires laid all over
campus for its broadcasts. Trans
mission lines connect the central
studios with transmitters in En
cina Hall, Union, and Lagunita. A
transmitter in the Village receives

signals over a leased telephone j
line.
"Remote lines" arc laid to various I
key locations on campus so that on- i
the - spot broadcasts can be made '
from these points. Chief engineer
Krock estimates 20,000 feet of trans- j
mission line on campus—"and that's
a very conservative estimate."
Krock runs the technical side of
KZSU from an open cubbyhole
("my office") in the basement of the
Speech and Drama section of Me
morial Auditorium building. Just
around the corner is KZSU's main
office, where Station Manager Joan
Coldren supervises all KZSU func
tions. The main broadcasting studio :
is upstairs on the second floor.
"We have a strictly commercial j
setup here," Krock says. "KZSU j
doesn't come under ASSU, and we I
have a regular budget from the Uni- I
versity. Profits theoretically go to •
the University, but we seldom have |
any profits."
KZSU was set up on an experi
mental basis in 1047, with a grant
from the University of $1,400. At
the end of the six-month trial pc- j
riod, the station was doing well j
and was established as a per ma- j
nent department of the Univer
sity, later being assimilated into
