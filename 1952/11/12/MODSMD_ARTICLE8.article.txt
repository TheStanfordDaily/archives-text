Modern Egypt's "middle class
revolution"' was discussed last night
by Madame Aluned Hussein at. the
Tuesday Evening Scries lecture.
In the past 3D years, she observed,
a new class has been rccruitcd from
the peasant and wealthy classes
which has developed a social con
sciousness and feeling toward Egypt.
Consisting of the educated profes
sional and business citizens; this
new middle class has been instru
mental in developing rural co-op
erative centers and improving peas
ant life.
Speaking without a prepared
text, Madame Hussein said that
the development of mass educa
tion has stimulated interest in so
cial progress. Thirty years ago
only one million pounds were
spent annually on public educa
tion. Today the budget provides
million pounds for educational
expenses.
She said that. Egypt now has over
otic million industrial workers,
mainly concentrated in the cotton
and woolen textile industries. The
workers arc organized and benefit
from modern social legislation.
The attractive wife of the for
mer minister of social affairs dis
cussed the role of rural co-opera
tives in the "new Egypt." These
village centers are built with local
funds supplemented with govern
men subsidies.
Each of the 150 carefully planned
buildings, which now serve 300 vil
lages, include:, a clinic, stage, screen,
library, handicraft and athletic
equipment.
Madame Hussein added thai social
.security benefits and health pro
grams have also improved the lot
of the peasant class, which com
poses almost HO per cent of the
total population.
