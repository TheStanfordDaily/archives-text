# 500-Pint Goal Still Short; Donations End Tomorrow
## 
### 
Approximately 300 pints of whole blood which are expected to
be donated by Stanford students today and tomorrow will be flown
from San Francisco to the wounded men in Korea within 48 hours
after it has been given.
Donations will bo taken in the Red Cross Mobile Unit stationed
in front of the Women's Clubhouse all day today and until 3:30
tomorrow.
Anyone who is still interested in yiving blood, but who has not
made an appointment, may come to the Mobile Unit between 12
and 3:30 p.m. tomorrow, and his donation will be accepted then.

To puhlieize the drive and to get
more donors, five patients from Oak
Knoll Hospital who were on the Ko
rean battlefront and who received
blood transfusions there are touring
the campus today between 10 and 2.
The men will have lunch at some of
the fraternity houses and will talk
to the residents of the houses in
an effort to help them understand
how urgently their blood contribu
tions are needed.
Illustrating the importance of
blood to the wounded men over
seas, two marines from Oak Knoll
Hospital told living groups Mon
day nighf of their experiences and
how blood transfusions furnished
by the Red Cross bad helped to
save their lives.
Pfc. Bob Ranee, Des Moine*,
lowa, told how lie had been hit
by a mine close to Bunker llill
and had immediately been flown
by helicopter to a medical center
where he received 30 pints of
blood.
After having been hit by eenmy
fire in west Panmunjom, Sgt. Bill
Fox, St. Paul, Minnesota, received
four pints of blood while bein'*
evacuated to the nearest medical
station in a jeep under fire.
Both men attribute the saving of
their lives to the hlood transfusions
which they received.
According to Student Health
Committee Chairman Bill Tocher,
signups for donations were disap
pointing. A goal of 500 pints was
set; however, only 425 made ap
pointments. and of these probably
only .'lOO will be eligible to donate
their blood.
Those who are expecting to make
donations today and tomorrow are
reminded of the following qualifi
cations:
1. All prospective donors under
21 years of age must have iheir
parents' signature* on the official
Red Cross forms provided for that,
purpose before they may rivh

2. Only fruit juice, dry toast,
and blark coffee may be eaten
during the four hours preceding

11. Donors must not have given

adverse effect on the donor.
The entire donation procedure re
■ quires about an hour including time

lowing the donation.
All blood obtained from this drive
