# 'Yes' on the Liquor Resolution
## 
### 
We urge a "Yes" vote on both question's in
the referendum on the proposed liquor reso
lution.
We do this fully realizing the complexities
involved, fully seeing that the resolution as it
stands is not perfect, fully realizing that sub
mitting it to the State Legislature will involve
many setbacks.
We urge a "Yes" vote on both questions,
because we think openly supporting a reso- <
lution ol this kind is an excellent way to turn
a spotlight on the deplorable liquor situation
and to start some action toward finding a so
lution to the whole college-age liguor prob
hlein.
As we write this, we recall dozens of exam
pies of the unworkubility of the present strin
gent liquor legislation--of the young married
couples who cannot legally servo a glass of
wine with dinner in their own homes ... of
the young people who have served in the
Army, who are completely responsible and in
dependent. who are forced to bear the burdens
of adulthood and yet who have none of its
privileges ... of the many situations where
a young person is forced to obey a law which
has little or no basis in piGsent-day morals or
ethics. , .
We recall the flagrant violations of the law
and the scorn we believe it generates for law
in general. And we realize again that change
is desperately neded.
Thus, v/e believe that Stanford's approv
ing Excom's liquor resolution and submitting
it to the California State Legislature would be
a fine jumping off place in the search for a
more realistic and workable liquor law.
( First, let us explain why we ask you to vote
""Yes" on the first question: "Do you approve
of the idea?" (That is, setting "the minimum
legal age for the purchase of beers, ales, and
wines containing less than 13 per cent alcohol
•by volume at 18 years and providing persons
between the ages of 18 and 21 years with non
transferable personal identication which in
cludes a picture of the holder.")
Seme of the arguments for lowering the

drinking age have been stated above. Eight
een seems a logical age because it is the age
when we assume so many other responsibili
ties—military service, marriage, financial inde
pendence, for example.
The arguments against this idea are many.
'I'hey are largely based on the tear that the
average 18 year-old who has never been on
his own is not capable o 1 bearing the re
sponsibility oI drinking. We believe this is
no reason tor concern. The 19-year-olds who
are not on their own can be kept in check
by their parents or other guardians. If neces
sary, the law can step in—as it does now
when parents fail to uphold their responsi
bill ties.
We also fail lo be convinced by the argu
ments against submitting the idea to the Legis
lature. There are those who say that support
ing an effort like this is not the job of student
government, To them we answer that working
toward anything which increases the general
welfare is the job of any government in a
democratic society.
There are others who fear the damage to
Stanford's reputation when it becomes known
as it soon would whether we wanted it to or
not . that we supported a resolution of this kind.
Our answer to them is that no university should
be ashamed of having a reputation for generat
ing ideas and standing behind them.
A university should be a place where con
structive ideas are born and then acted on. It
is not enough merely to have the ideas. A
scientist would be severely criticized ii he
tailed to announce a discovery because he
didn't leel it was proper to make his theory
known. Why shouldn't we be just as willing
to announce our theories in social science?
We visualize the support of Excom's resolu
tion as the fiist step toward some real action
on the liguor situation. It would be used to
start a united college eflort toward getting some
new and more realistic legislation.
The present liquor situation is deplorable.
Efforts for a change must come eventually.

on the liguor situation. It would be used to
start a united college eflort toward getting some
new and more realistic legislation.
The present liquor situation is deplorable.
Efforts for a change must come eventually.
Why not here and now?
We urge a "Yes" vote on both question's in
the referendum on the proposed liquor reso
lution.
We do this fully realizing the complexities
involved, fully seeing that the resolution as it
stands is not perfect, fully realizing that sub
mitting it to the State Legislature will involve
many setbacks.
We urge a "Yes" vote on both questions,
because we think openly supporting a reso- <
lution ol this kind is an excellent way to turn
a spotlight on the deplorable liquor situation
and to start some action toward finding a so
lution to the whole college-age liguor prob
hlein.
As we write this, we recall dozens of exam
pies of the unworkubility of the present strin
gent liquor legislation--of the young married
couples who cannot legally servo a glass of
wine with dinner in their own homes ... of
the young people who have served in the
Army, who are completely responsible and in
dependent. who are forced to bear the burdens
of adulthood and yet who have none of its
privileges ... of the many situations where
a young person is forced to obey a law which
has little or no basis in piGsent-day morals or
ethics. , .
We recall the flagrant violations of the law
and the scorn we believe it generates for law
in general. And we realize again that change
is desperately neded.
Thus, v/e believe that Stanford's approv
ing Excom's liquor resolution and submitting
it to the California State Legislature would be
a fine jumping off place in the search for a
more realistic and workable liquor law.
( First, let us explain why we ask you to vote
""Yes" on the first question: "Do you approve
of the idea?" (That is, setting "the minimum
legal age for the purchase of beers, ales, and
wines containing less than 13 per cent alcohol
•by volume at 18 years and providing persons
between the ages of 18 and 21 years with non
transferable personal identication which in
cludes a picture of the holder.")
Seme of the arguments for lowering the

drinking age have been stated above. Eight
een seems a logical age because it is the age
when we assume so many other responsibili
ties—military service, marriage, financial inde
pendence, for example.
The arguments against this idea are many.
'I'hey are largely based on the tear that the
average 18 year-old who has never been on
his own is not capable o 1 bearing the re
sponsibility oI drinking. We believe this is
no reason tor concern. The 19-year-olds who
are not on their own can be kept in check
by their parents or other guardians. If neces
sary, the law can step in—as it does now
when parents fail to uphold their responsi
bill ties.
We also fail lo be convinced by the argu
ments against submitting the idea to the Legis
lature. There are those who say that support
ing an effort like this is not the job of student
government, To them we answer that working
toward anything which increases the general
welfare is the job of any government in a
democratic society.
There are others who fear the damage to
Stanford's reputation when it becomes known
as it soon would whether we wanted it to or
not . that we supported a resolution of this kind.
Our answer to them is that no university should
be ashamed of having a reputation for generat
ing ideas and standing behind them.
A university should be a place where con
structive ideas are born and then acted on. It
is not enough merely to have the ideas. A
scientist would be severely criticized ii he
tailed to announce a discovery because he
didn't leel it was proper to make his theory
known. Why shouldn't we be just as willing
to announce our theories in social science?
