# BULL SESSION
## 
### SAM FRESHMAN 
It happened at the ASSU Leadership Conference
(attended by all campus politicos both incumbents
and hopefuls). A student approached Cardinal mem
ber John Stahr, co-chairman of the conference, and
a«ked for a cigarette.
Stahr answered, "I didn't bring my cigarettes
because I knew most of the campus leaders would
be here!''.

This incident being completely
unrelated to the problem about to
Le discussed serves as an intro
duction.
Finally after discoursing on
everything from financial state
ments to Stanford women I am
prepared to give the full scoop
tu all under-graduate. "red hots''
<>n the subject closest to their
hearts. One of the most popular
but least publicised activities

open to the Stanford undergrad is joining a com
mittee.
Hundreds do it every year hut actually little is
known about the intricate and subtle process itself.
Although many "how to do it" hooks are available
such as the Palo Alto Boy Scout Council's "How to
Build Model Boats," the BAC's "How t«> Impress
Women," and The National Honor Society's "How
tu Cheat at Cards" no one has yet seen til to pre
pare a course on how to join a committee.
The simplest way to begin sue.h a course would be
to go through the various steps necessary tu become
a leal member of some imaginery organization. Let
u% assume that Rah-Rah Com has decided it needs
fifteen more members because its present start' of
3U5 is inadequate.
The chairman of the group, after properly clear
ing vfitlv the present staff to see how many of the
openings can be filled by their friends, puts a notice
m the paper to the effect that "Rah-Rah-Com" will
hold interviews today, tomorrow, next Wednesday,
and on very odd Fridays for 15 members needed to
do very important work of a general nature. The
positions are open to all students who have three or

' — |
more units except transfer students, freshmen, in
dependent graduate students, and those living in uni
versity residences, fraternities, or off-campus. How
ever, in a few cases where exceptional interest is
shown the above ruels do not apply."
The student who aspires to he a real "wheel"
then proceeds to cut three bio lectures and a civ
mid-term in order to keep his appointment with
the interviewers. When he arrives he will find one
of two situations (a) Rah-Kali Com had a full page
in last year's QUAD and there is a line of people
waiting to l>c interviewed or (h) Kali-Kali Com is
a new committee, someone tied last year and forgot
to gel a QUAD picture and hence no one is wait
ing to he interviewed.
After gaining entrance to the inquisition chambers
the prospective cuinocrat meets his opponents, i.e.
incumbent members intent on getting as many pro
totypes of themselves on the committee as possible.
First is Bmoc Bucks, Kah-Rah Chairman, and a
genial sort of fellow who tries to put the applicant
at ease by slapping him on the back while fingering
the quality of his sweater.
Next comes "Saddle" Shoe, a sexy-looking type
who has her curves in the right places and is never
seen on Quad without a white sweater (usually hold
ing a large diamond inerusled fraternity pin) and red
skirt. She manages to say nothing and look superior,
worldly, dumb, and innocent at the same time.
The last and most dangerous member of the hoard
of inquisition is K. Aardvark who isn't chairman
hut wants to he. lie looks on each applicant as
a potential competitor and is usually the one who
tires all the qusetions. If the aspirant answers
quickly and intelligently Aardvark immediately
makes a mental note to din£ him at the next meet
ing. (I>ing is a coniocracy term meaning to vote
down or refuse membership).
Next week I will discuss the rating system used by
the interviewers when picking new committee mem
bers. There will also be advice on how to act dur
ing an interview and how to build up your confidence,
self-esteem, and egotism.
