About Thorns

To the Editor:
. . .'With reference to your cditruial of Nov. 11.
"Roses arid Thorns."
1 agree that your bouquets of thorns might he
awarded in the second and third eases
I take issue with you on the first bouquet. The
script itself contained nothing in bad taste. The in
li i pretatlons of the script were left up to the .listen
i rs May 1 point out that perhaps it was tins par
tieular member of the audience whose mind was
lacking in good taste. Perhaps it was not that the
planners of the rally forgot about the obligations of
good taste, but that the author of that very self
righteous editorial is blessed with a perverted mind
Pel haps the offended listener war, frustrated by tin

fact that people were enjoying themselves (as an
eyewitness at the rally, I saw no evidence of dis
comfort in the audience) and his/her resentment took
the form of an empassioned editorial on morality. 1
shall not attempt to analyze further the motives of
the author of the editorial. However, 1 have a final
statement concerning the editorial as they would say
in France (and is so applicable here).
"lloiii soit qui mal y pense."
MIKE IJUDSb'N, Encina
(Editor's note: If Reader Hudson is correct tlial
the planners of Friday's rally intended their script
to he in good taste, then perhaps the planners of
future rallies should make more allowance for
Stanford students' imaginations. Incidentally, any
resemblance between Header Hudson and the
Michael ( . Hudson of Daily sports stuff fame is
purely coincidental)
