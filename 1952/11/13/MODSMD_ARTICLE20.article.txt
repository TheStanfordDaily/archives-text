# SRI Plays Tag with Atoms

### ROY BROUN 
A rebounding action like that
of billiard balls will soon be put
to use in testing metallic struc
tures of alloys for the Army.
A $200,000 ion-scattering an
alyzer, recently developed by
Stanford Kesearch Institute,
uses this action to identify and
measure minute quantities of
elements present in the sur
face of a liibstance. it does this
by bouncing a stream of pro
tons off the atoms in the sur
face.
Joining a two - million -.volt
generator, a 20 - foot vacuum
tube, anil two large electro-mug
nets, SRl's new analyzer, nick
n a m e d "Proton Bombarder,"
weighs five tons. Yet it can de
tect an element in quantities
weighing us little us one - mil
lionth of one - millionth of a

gramâ€”or about one thirty - tril
lionth of an ounce.
The method evolved from ap
paratus and techniques devel
oped in atom-smashing research.
In an atom - .smasher, however,
protons hit their turyet with such
great speed that the atoms are
altered. Protons in the new ana
lyzer, traveling at lesser speeds,
bounce off the atoms without
changing them.
Protons are accelerated in a
vertical vacuum tube until
they emerge from the bottom
at a speed of about one-thir
tieth that of light. The ve
locity of the stream emerging
from the tulie drives many of
(lie protons into (he sample to
he analyzed as far as one ten
thousandth of an inch, only to
La bounced back as they hit
the atoms of the sample. The

heavier the weight of the atom,
the greater the rebound ve
locity of the proton hitting that
atom.
Some protons leaving the tar
yet pass between the poles of an
electro - magnet which deflects
them in a curved path, the
.sharpness of the curve depend
ing on the rebound velocity of
the proton. Thus sorted out, the
protons pass through a counting
device. This reveals the propor
tional composition of the sub
stance as indicated by the rela
tive numbers of the protons
counted.
Besides military uses, later
industrial applications of the
"Proton Bombarder" will prob
ably include studies of lubri
cants, coatings, and finishes,
and analysis of minute un
known materials.
