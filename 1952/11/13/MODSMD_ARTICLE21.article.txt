# STANFORD GOLF COURSE
## Water Holes, Sand Traps Snare Unwary Golfers 
### TONY HODGE 
Just a Spalding Dot's throw behind Roble Hall lies over a mile
and a half of rolling green turf cut to hairline precision. It is the
famous and tricky Stanford Golf Course.
Built in 1929 by the renowned golf course architect, Bill Bell, the
course has survived 23 years without a major change, and still

remains one of the toughest courses
on the Coast for any club-swinger to
crack.
Head grounds keeper Ellis Van
Gorder calls the course a good test
lor the experienced goller. because if
requires many placed shots to escape
the unusually large number of water
holes. "The fairways are hilly and
twisting, definitely not built for the
beginner and average woman golfer,"
he smiles.
Of all the boles 011 the course,
Mr. Van Gorder considers the M -
yurd twelfth the hardest.
Vandals so far have never dam
aged the course seriously, he com
mented. The mysterious holes that
appeared on the fairways recently
turned out to be the work of
hungry racoons looking for food.
Mr. Van Gorder says course
authorities do have trouble with
"cut ins" who try every year to
sneak a few free holes of golf. How
ever, he warned, those who try are
usually caught and sent up before
Al Masters and the Board of Athletic
Control.
Kates are comparatively cheap.
The serious golfer can enjoy IS
holes of golf for 75C per round any
week-day if he purchases (hi* 20-
round card. The occasional golfer
may play for the regular $2 green
fees.
The course, open seven dJys a
week, is open only to students, fac
ulty, and club members.
Money-less athletic students find
that caddying offers an unlimited
source of funds. Maintenance and
upkeep jobs are few during fall and
winter months, but will be plentiful
next spring after the rains.
