# VARSITY SEMI-FINAL AGAINST DUCKS
## Mathias Switched to Half; Ron Cook, Skip Crist Out 
### DON WEBSTER 
Bob Mathias was switched to halfback yesterday for Saturday's
game with Oregon, as Chuck Taylor made a unexpected move to
take the place of halfbacks Ron Cook and Skip Crist. The pair were
declared definitely out against the Ducks by trainer Connie Jarvis.
Chuck Brazel is slated to start at the left half spot, with Jarvis

Wutson at fullback. Mathias has
never played right half for the In
dians before, though he, like all of
the Stanford backs, is familiar with
the plays for both half posts.
Cook, who is suffering from leg
injuries, saw little action last week
against USC, and Crist suffered
both a brain concussion and a
broken nose in the Trojan contest.
Bob Iloegh is also unable to play
Saturday. The three on the bench
ntltl to the Indians' troubles of a
growing sick list, which already in
cludes Stanford's two best players.
Bob Garrett and Norm Manoogian.
Saturday's game with Oregon
might well turn into a battle of the

defenses, Taylor said. The varsity
staged another scrimmage yesterday,
emphasizing pass defense. The
Duck's aerial game is their most
potent offense, with Hal Dunham
being their best player.
As for the Oregon defense, Tay
lor said Stanford fans should not
suffer under any delusions about
it."The Ducks have a better de
fense than we have, both on paper
and on results thus far this season."
"While they have no outstanding
stars such as USC had in their de
fensive line, Len Casanova has clone
a fine job in providing a well-bal

anced club. Our players should be
no more overconfident about Oregon,
simply because they faced USC the
week before, than they should have
been against Washington after the
UCLA contest."
