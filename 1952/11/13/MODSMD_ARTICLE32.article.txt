As the smoke of battle clears, a battered and beaten bunch of
prognosticators march forth from the scene of defeat to try and
salvage the last of their once impressive records.
There have been casualties, as there are in any great battle. Big
Mike Hudson, once so proud and strong in his second place spot, 1
was critically hit in six places. He is now fifth.

Al Kirkland, leading last week's
charge, was battered badly by five
direct hits. He is now a step be
hind the front line with 43 and 17.
Leading this week's charge are
Phil Berman lor the typewriter
troopers and Jim Vick for the mus
cle benders. Both are tied with 44
and 16 with a .733 percentage.
The greatest come - through per
formance of the season, however,
was perforated by Sir Richard the
• Maltzman. His third straight week
with 8 and 2 has moved him from
sixth to a tie for second with Kirk
land. '
Three games out is Hudson, the

sweetheart of Sigmund Freud,
followed closely (he's very popu
lar) by Larrv Cahn, six games
out, and Chuck Taylor, way out.
As far as corps standings go, and
they are, the dippymaniacs are still
leading by a scant .009, . G92 to
.683. If you have been paying any
attention, the footballers are clos
ing the gap. They gained a whole
.001 last week. Stout going, fellows.

sixth to a tie for second with Kirk
land. '
Three games out is Hudson, the

sweetheart of Sigmund Freud,
followed closely (he's very popu
lar) by Larrv Cahn, six games
out, and Chuck Taylor, way out.
As far as corps standings go, and
they are, the dippymaniacs are still
leading by a scant .009, . G92 to
.683. If you have been paying any
attention, the footballers are clos
ing the gap. They gained a whole
.001 last week. Stout going, fellows.

As the smoke of battle clears, a battered and beaten bunch of
prognosticators march forth from the scene of defeat to try and
salvage the last of their once impressive records.
There have been casualties, as there are in any great battle. Big
Mike Hudson, once so proud and strong in his second place spot, 1
was critically hit in six places. He is now fifth.

Al Kirkland, leading last week's
charge, was battered badly by five
direct hits. He is now a step be
hind the front line with 43 and 17.
Leading this week's charge are
Phil Berman lor the typewriter
troopers and Jim Vick for the mus
cle benders. Both are tied with 44
and 16 with a .733 percentage.
The greatest come - through per
