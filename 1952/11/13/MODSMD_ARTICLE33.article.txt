## Rain Falls in Mural Play As Toro Wins 
### WES MARX 
A misty riÂ»in, followed by ap
i proaching darkness, hampered of
fenses and kept scores low in mural
football play yesterday.
The Terman Band El Toro teams
found the weather mod harmful,
as neither team could score, with
the victory going to El Toro under
the mural playoff system. In a dead
locked game, the team which gath
i ers the most yardage on one set of
i downs wins. El Toro's scant four

j yards was enough to beat out Ter
! man, which didn't get past the
I first - down scrimmage line. EI
Toro's Ted Cannis' nailing of a
Terman back for a three-yard loss
highlighted the stoppage of Ter
man.
Toro Nearly Scores
El Toro almost drovf to* a score
| in the fourth quarter. Utilizing end
! sweeps with Bill Mosser or Don
I Swedenborg carrying the ball, the
! eating club drove to the Terman
i eight - yard line. But the spirited
Terman defense, which played the ;
| whole game with only six men as !
compared with the usual seven, j
| halted the invaders Terman's tough |
j defense was led by guard Stan
i Scarborough, who harassed Toro
! backs continually and also recov
ered a fumble. For El Toro, end
I Chuck Silverbdrg's defensive play
i shone.
