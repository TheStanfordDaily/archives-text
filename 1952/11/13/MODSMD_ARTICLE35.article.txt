Prior to this season, the yearlings have been the scourge of the

frosh league, goint; undefeated in
*47 -'48-'4y and posting a 3-1 record
in 1950. Frosh ball was discontinued
by the PCC in 1951.
Beaten by the Trojans, .'l3-13,
and Santa Clara, 211-17. the local
fvosh defeated (lie UCLA fresh
men. 42-0, in a first-half scoring
debacle. The Hears have beaten
Yuba City, 44-! 1. succumbed to
use, 19-12. and the IJCLA frosh.
34-2(1. With these mediocre rec
ords. (he teams have no pennant
j fever, no pressure, and will be
ready for a grudge ,;ame worthy
of varsity support.
Besides the won-lost mark, the
Cards have been hampered by in
juries and bad breaks. Hard-run
ning Jim Truher has been nursing
a thigh injury since the first quar-

ter of the Bronco tilt, and is un
likely to see duty this Saturday.
Along with Truher, a pre - season
injury to halfback Harry Sykes has
kept the speed-burner out of the
contests.
Playing their best game of the
year in the Trojan defeat, the Cubs
have shown an inconsistent defen
sive team, and a strong offensive
club, especially in halfbacks Jerry
Drew and Gerry Riggins, quarter
back Hugh McGuire, and fullback
Harlan Stroud. Riggins is rated one
of the most outstanding backs to
come out of the Los Angeles area in
recent years.
Starting at end for the Papooses
will be Steve Doctor. The 17-
year-old end front Santa Barbara,
standing (i feet is being counted
heavily by frosh coach Bob Ghi
lo(ti to turn in another outstand
ing performance.
