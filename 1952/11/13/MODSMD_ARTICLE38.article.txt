# Lack of Top-Flight Teams Hits Bowls
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 12 (UP) — An
unusual shortage of strong, avail
able college lootball teams harassed
bowl - game promoters today and
threatened to make sub - standard
attractions of the New Year's Day
classics.
Time was when a major bowl
game was a climactic meeting be
tween two of the nation's ranking
powers, like last year's Sugar Bowl
clash involving Maryland and Ten
nessee. From the looks of things,
there won't be any such headline
battles in this year's bowls.
