# Frost Memorial Amphitheater
## Former Student Honored by Gift 
### NAN CERINI 
Many Stanford students form
both their first and their last im
pressions of the University amid
the beauty of Frost Amphithea
ter. the setting for the Welcome
Assembly for incoming fresh
men and the Commencement
Exorcises for graduating seniors.
Like the University itself, the
Lawrence Frost Memorial Amphi
theater is a monument to parental
loss and affection. It was donated by
Mr. and Mrs. Howard Frost of Los
Angeles in memory of their son, John
Lawrence Frost, who died on
Augest 7, 1935, while in his senior
year at the University.
In addition to the $90,000 they
gave the University for planning
and constructing the Amphitheater,
the Frosts have also donated a
$25,000 John Lawrence Frost lyoatl
Fund to the University for financial
aid to students.
The Amphitheater is designed to
preserve its natural resemblance
to the California foothills. Even the
trees and shrubs have been selected
for their appropriateness in a Cali
fornia landscape.
The stage is below the west, rim
and has for a backdrop tree-covered
slopes like those in the Coast Range.
To the east are the terraced and
grass-covered seats, which can hold
over 8.000 people.
There arc many oaks in the
amphitheater, following Greek and
Roman traditions of using oak trees
as permanent, living stage fixtures.
Among the other trees in and
around the Amphitheater are birch
es, elms, beeches, conifers, and
flowering cherries, plums, apricots,
quinces, crab apples, and magnolias.
And now, thanks to the generosity
of the Frosts, every year since the
46th Commencement in 1937 when
the ceremony was first held in Frost
Amphitheater, the senior class has
graduated among the outstanding
beauty of this memorial.

The Amphitheater is designed to
preserve its natural resemblance
to the California foothills. Even the
trees and shrubs have been selected
for their appropriateness in a Cali
fornia landscape.
The stage is below the west, rim
and has for a backdrop tree-covered
slopes like those in the Coast Range.
To the east are the terraced and
grass-covered seats, which can hold
over 8.000 people.
There arc many oaks in the
amphitheater, following Greek and
Roman traditions of using oak trees
as permanent, living stage fixtures.
Among the other trees in and
around the Amphitheater are birch
es, elms, beeches, conifers, and
flowering cherries, plums, apricots,
quinces, crab apples, and magnolias.
And now, thanks to the generosity
of the Frosts, every year since the
46th Commencement in 1937 when
the ceremony was first held in Frost
Amphitheater, the senior class has
graduated among the outstanding
beauty of this memorial.


A MONUMENT TO PARENTAL LOSS—The John Laurence Frost Amphitheater has been the scene
of many campus activities, including the Freshman Welcoming Assembly and the June Gradua
tion. The Amphitheater is designed to resemble the California foothills.
