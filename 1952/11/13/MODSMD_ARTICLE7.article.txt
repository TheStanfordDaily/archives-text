# Rally Taste Acted On By Excom
## 
### JIM MADISON Associate Editor, The Daily 
In a well-exocuted triple play
initiated by Student Manager
Steve Horn last night, Excom
disposed of the embarrassing
problem posed by last Friday's
SC rally.
The rally had called forth many
protests from alumni, parents, and
administration officials for its re
ported bad taste.
After receiving the apologies of
Rally Com chairman Fred Backer
and after learning that there was
considerable mixup in the approval
of the proposed rally, Excom took
the following action:
1. Unanimously refused to re for
any of the members of Rally Com
who violated good taste to Men's
Council for disciplinary action.
2. Unanimously gave a mild
and constructive rebuke to the
violators.
They were instructed to work
with ASSU president I)ick Weiss
man, Fundamental Standard Com
chairman Tom Blount, Rally Com
chairman Backer, and a represen
tative of Men's Council in devel
oping a sort of code of ethics for
rallies: what types of rallies and
skits should he presented and the
general principles of good taste in
rallies.
3. Passed by a vote of 8 to 2 a
motion specifically setting the future
responsibility for rallies and their
good taste in the hands of the Rally
Committee. Charlotte Trego, wom
en's halls representative, and Jack
Frascr, '55 representative, voted
against the final action, declaring
that such responsibility was already
implied in the ASSU constitution.
In another significant move, the
Executive Committee left the Em
porium a rally planned for next
Monday night without any raili
crs.
Following a combined Stanford-
Cal rally held at the Emporium
last year on the Monday preceding
Big Game, the C'itv department
store approached Stanford and
Cal with plans for a similar rally
this yearâ€”proposedly to he held
next Monday night at (i:3O.
The ASUC has notified the Em
porium that it. would not. partici
pate in the rally, because il felt that
there was too much commercialism
attached to the rally.
Last night Excom voted unani
mously that Stanford not participate
in the rally for identical reasons.
Some tension arose after last
year's rally, since during appear
ances by yell leaders, entertainers,
and bands from each school, the
head of Cal's mascot Oskic was sto
len in a breach of the Cal-Stanford
Non-Aggression Pact.
