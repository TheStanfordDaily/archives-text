lar resolution has little chance of
success, it would at least start the
ball rollin'g.
AGAINST SUBMITTING TII E
IDEA TO THE LEGISLATURE: 1.
It would hurt Stanford's reputation
to have the name of the University
attached to a resolution like this.

Ex corn's much - discussed
liquor resolution goes before the

California set the minimum legal
age for the purchase of beers, ales,
and wines containing less than l.'t

1. "Do you approve of this idea?
2. "Do you approve of submitting
this idea to the State Legislature?"
Following is a summary of the pros
and cons.
IN FAVOR OF THE IDEA: 1. The
present law is unrealistic; it is un
sound legislation because it is un

ture judgment.
AGAINST THE IDEA: 1. Though
the 18-year-old college student may

turity of the 18-year-old high school
student is doubtful.
2. Lowering the drinking age
would create more problems with
youthful drivers.
There would probably be more
drinking—especially among the bor
derline cases whom the law now
keeps from drinking.
4. Disrespect for the liquor law
doesn't really carry over to other
laws; there is a direct comparison
between violating this and violating
traffic laws.

first step toward alleviating what is
