# CARD COMEBACK CAMPAIGN
## Oregon's Passers Will Test Indians 
### DON WEBSTER 
The Varsity football players of Coach Chuck Taylor will attempt
to hit the comeback trail tomorrow, as they face Len Casanova's
Oregon Ducks. Kickoff time is slated for 2 p.m. in the Stanford
Stadium.
After suffering the worst defeat in recent Indian history last

week at the hands of USC, many
fans tend to underestimate the Duclc
team. Actually, they stand second
in league standings in pass defense,
headed only by the Trojans. Quar
terbacks Hal Dunham and George
Shaw are a pair of dangerous pass
ers who can score at any minute
without notice. *
Still another blow struck the
Indians yesterday as trainer Con
nie Jarvis said that tackle AI Kirk
land. suffering from a brain con
cussion, will not see action Satur
day.
Only good news of the week from
the doctor's office is that X-rays
show that Bob Mathias' ribs are only
bruised, and he will be able to play
Saturday.
Football practice on Thursdays is
usually a non-contact affair. But.
yesterday Taylor had his men in full
attire, practicing offenses with Jack
Gebert at quarterback. There wore
no injuries, though Dick Borda was
slightly shaken wp on one play.
Despite a poor won-lost record thh
season, the Ducks have played
heads-up ball. They lost to UCLA
by a mere 13 to 7, and at halftime in
the Cal game were tied, 7 to 7.
On the other hand, the injury
outlook for the Indians is far from
good. Five key players have been
lost in the past four days: quarter
back Bob Garrett, defensive end
Bob Hoegh (both are lost for the
Big Game also), halfbacks Skip
Crist and Ron Cook, and Kirkland.
Taylor has decided to start Bnl>
Mathias at a halfback spot, with

The two quarterbacks on (he
Duck squad will both see action
tomorrow. Dunham, a six-foot-oiv
senior, completed 89 passes last
season to be second in the league.
Shaw, only a sophomore, is one
of a football family of Shaws. His
brother Tom, ex-quarterback for
Indians, is an assistant coach to
morrow when the Stanford frosh
face Cal. Another brother, Jack,
will be up in the press box doing
the game for Associated Sportcasts.
Still another brother, originally
a tackle on the Oregon team, has
been sidelined for the season with
a leg injury. Shaw (George) has
also played halfback on the Duck
offense, and may start in either
position.
The outstanding receiver of Dun

year, and, if he catches 12 more in
the next two games, will both

As for the Indians, the game is
their last at home for the'year, and

week at Berkeley.
