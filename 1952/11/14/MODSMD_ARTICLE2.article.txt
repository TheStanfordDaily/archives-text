# UN Adviser to Lie Leaps Twelve Stories to Death

### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 13 (UP)—A
top legal expert of the United Na
tions, who suffered a nervous break
down in the midst of a Senate com
mittee investigation of Communist
activities at the world organization,
leaped 12 stories to his death today
from his Central Park apartment.
Abraham H. Feller, 47, a close
adviser of UN Secretary General
Trygvc Lie, fought off his wife and
plunged from a bedroom window.
His body landed in a rear courtyard.
It was revealed that Feller had
been questioned by representatives
of the Senate Internal Security sub
committee investigating Red activ
ity among American UN employees.
But there was no indication that
Feller's loyalty had been ques
tioned.
Sen. Pat McCarran, chairman of
tine Senate Judiciary Committee and
head of the internal security group,
said that if Feller's "conscience was
clear, he had no reason to suffer
from what he expected of our com
mittee." He added that "anything I
say" doesn't "mean to imply that he
has done anything wrong."
"It's unfortunate that we must
make these disclosures," McCarran
said just before sailing for South
America aboard the S.S. Uruguay,
"but it is to the best interest of all
concerned."
Lie, stunned by news of his ad
viser's death, blamed it on over
work causcd by the subcommittee's
inquiry.
"He had worked tirelessly day and
night under my direction to uphold
due process of law and justice in
the investigation against indis
criminate smears and exaggerated
•charges," Lie said.
"This placed him under a pro
longed and serious strain. The ter
rible tragedy of his death today is
the result."
Choking with emotion, Mrs. Feller
.sat in the living room of their apart
ment shortly after her husband's
death and told how she spent the
morning trying to persuade him not
to kill himself.
Mrs. Feller said Lie's announce
ment earlier this week that he

would resign was a "contributing
factor" in her husband's death. "But
there were a lot of things that up
set him," she added.
Feller was one of the officials who
urged Lie to denounce North Ko
rea's attack on South Korea the
same day it took place. This de
nunciation led to Russia's boycott
of Lie and this in turn was largely
responsible for Lie's resignation.
Frank Bcglcy, UN chief security
officer, said Feller's loyalty had not
been questioned.
