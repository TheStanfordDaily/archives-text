# Act Now—Don't Complain Later
## 
### 
You've heard the old sayinq about the ounce
of prevention .. .
Remember it today, when you have your
chance to vote in the ASSU elections. "
Do you have any strong feelings about how
student government should operate? Do you
think things should be done differently than
they are now? Then elect someone who you
think will do things the way you want them
done.

Also on the ballot will be Excom's referen
dum on the liquor resolution. The vote on it
will determine whether something will be done
now about the present deplorable liquor situ
ation —or whether we will leave it to someone
else to start the ball rolling. Voting today is
your one chance to make sure your opinion
will enter into the decision whether or not to
take a stand on the resolution.
Candidates and issues. Decide on them now.
Vote today. Don't wait and complain later.
