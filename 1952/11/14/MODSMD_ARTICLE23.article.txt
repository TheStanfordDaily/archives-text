To the Editor:
I find that the resolution passed by Excom in favor
of lowering the drinking age is too illogical to be
accepted by anyone who is familiar with the drinking
problem in California.
First of all, the present law itself is not unrealistic.
In fact it is very realistic because it recognizes a very
terious problem. It is the enforcement of that k.w
wh'ch is unrealistic, and made so by the forces in
California which want to see the revenues from the
liquor industry remain at such a high level as they
are now. Just because it is not enforced and consist
ently violated does not make it unrealistic! Perhaps
Excom should examine the reasons why it is violated
and not enforced.
Second, the Executive Committee of the Associated
Students of Stanford University is not more aware of
the situation than most citizens. They are not neces
sarily closer to the problem. Every person in this
state is affected by the ever-increasing liquor prob
lem; just take a look at the record of drunken drivers
in California. Why not ask those who really are
closest to the problem—the people who deal with
juveniles: teachers, probation officers, youth workers
in the Y and other organizations—what their opinion
is?
Third, Excom is not doing its best lo see that the
law is observed, and no one can deny that fact. There
is a lot more they could do in the way of enforce
ment, if their heart were in it.
Fourth, reaching the age of 18 does not mean that
one has automatically acquired good judgment. The
judgment that is required to be a good soldier is not
that which enables one to drink intelligently. In the
army the 18-year-old does what he is told; what has
this to do with knowing how to handle liquor? Just
because an 18-year-old has matured physically and
emotionally and is thus prepared for marriage, does
not give him the ability to drink intelligently. Legally;
the 18-20-year-old is still an infant. Special pro
visions are made for him in the law; he is not assumed
to carry as much responsibility as an adult.
Fifth, there is no precedent in any state adequate
enough to show the need for lowering the drinking
age in California, and what might work in New York,
Illinois, or any other state, would not automatically
work here.
Sixth, by saying that good legislation is that which
the citizens themselves help to enforce, Excom there
by infers that since the citizens do not help to en
force the present law it is not a good one. This, too,
is illogical. Don't you agree that most people would
do pretty much as they wanted if there were no law
to prevent them from doing so or if there was no
enforcement of that law? That is exactly what 18-20-
year-olds arc doing now. It is what the speedeis on
our nation's highways do every day; they go as fast
as they want until they see a cop arorund the corner.
Whose job is it to enforce the law? What a pretty
mess our highways would be if there were no high
way patrol. Perhaps it is the enforcement that is bad
and not the law itself. Anyone who knows Artie
Samish and the liquor lobby in the California legis
lature. and how they control the Board of Equaliza
tion, will agree that the enforcement is very poor
indeed.
Excom lias no assurance whatsoever that these
young people will protect a new privilege in every
way they can. They certainly found a way to falsify
existing identification cards, and even a picture on
there will not prevent new falsification. (They found
a way to change them in Illinois.)
Finally, the argument that the lure of the forbidden
is a strong one, and that it leads to excess, is absolutely
ridiculous. Everything that is illegal is forbidden;
does this mean we should have no laws? Do luws
preventing murder and robbery lead to more rob •
beries and murders? It is not an artificial statute
which leads to disrespect for the law among Cali
fornia youth, but lack of enforcement.
California already has a serious liquor problem,
especially among young people. We must remerrfber
we in college are a'minority of the people of our own
age. Perhaps we consider ourselves mature, but there
are many 18-year-olds who are not mature. Some of
them are still in high school. Yes, the drinking prob
lem has even reached the higlj schools. Sureiy, no
one in his right mind would urge that this problem
be increased. But that is what Excom's resolution
would have you do.
I urge you to vote against the referendum on
Fiiday, for your own sake, and to save the name of
the University from association with such an illogical
and unrealistic solution to a real problem.

enforcement of that law? That is exactly what 18-20-
year-olds arc doing now. It is what the speedeis on
our nation's highways do every day; they go as fast
as they want until they see a cop arorund the corner.
Whose job is it to enforce the law? What a pretty
mess our highways would be if there were no high
way patrol. Perhaps it is the enforcement that is bad
and not the law itself. Anyone who knows Artie
Samish and the liquor lobby in the California legis
lature. and how they control the Board of Equaliza
tion, will agree that the enforcement is very poor
indeed.
Excom lias no assurance whatsoever that these
young people will protect a new privilege in every
way they can. They certainly found a way to falsify
existing identification cards, and even a picture on
there will not prevent new falsification. (They found
a way to change them in Illinois.)
Finally, the argument that the lure of the forbidden
is a strong one, and that it leads to excess, is absolutely
ridiculous. Everything that is illegal is forbidden;
does this mean we should have no laws? Do luws
preventing murder and robbery lead to more rob •
beries and murders? It is not an artificial statute
which leads to disrespect for the law among Cali
fornia youth, but lack of enforcement.
California already has a serious liquor problem,
especially among young people. We must remerrfber
we in college are a'minority of the people of our own
age. Perhaps we consider ourselves mature, but there
are many 18-year-olds who are not mature. Some of
them are still in high school. Yes, the drinking prob
lem has even reached the higlj schools. Sureiy, no
one in his right mind would urge that this problem
be increased. But that is what Excom's resolution
would have you do.
I urge you to vote against the referendum on
Fiiday, for your own sake, and to save the name of
the University from association with such an illogical
and unrealistic solution to a real problem.

To the Editor:
I find that the resolution passed by Excom in favor
of lowering the drinking age is too illogical to be
accepted by anyone who is familiar with the drinking
problem in California.
First of all, the present law itself is not unrealistic.
In fact it is very realistic because it recognizes a very
terious problem. It is the enforcement of that k.w
wh'ch is unrealistic, and made so by the forces in
California which want to see the revenues from the
liquor industry remain at such a high level as they
are now. Just because it is not enforced and consist
ently violated does not make it unrealistic! Perhaps
Excom should examine the reasons why it is violated
and not enforced.
Second, the Executive Committee of the Associated
Students of Stanford University is not more aware of
the situation than most citizens. They are not neces
sarily closer to the problem. Every person in this
state is affected by the ever-increasing liquor prob
lem; just take a look at the record of drunken drivers
in California. Why not ask those who really are
closest to the problem—the people who deal with
juveniles: teachers, probation officers, youth workers
in the Y and other organizations—what their opinion
is?
Third, Excom is not doing its best lo see that the
law is observed, and no one can deny that fact. There
is a lot more they could do in the way of enforce
ment, if their heart were in it.
Fourth, reaching the age of 18 does not mean that
one has automatically acquired good judgment. The
judgment that is required to be a good soldier is not
that which enables one to drink intelligently. In the
army the 18-year-old does what he is told; what has
this to do with knowing how to handle liquor? Just
because an 18-year-old has matured physically and
emotionally and is thus prepared for marriage, does
not give him the ability to drink intelligently. Legally;
the 18-20-year-old is still an infant. Special pro
visions are made for him in the law; he is not assumed
to carry as much responsibility as an adult.
Fifth, there is no precedent in any state adequate
enough to show the need for lowering the drinking
age in California, and what might work in New York,
Illinois, or any other state, would not automatically
work here.
Sixth, by saying that good legislation is that which
the citizens themselves help to enforce, Excom there
by infers that since the citizens do not help to en
force the present law it is not a good one. This, too,
is illogical. Don't you agree that most people would
do pretty much as they wanted if there were no law
to prevent them from doing so or if there was no

ently violated does not make it unrealistic! Perhaps
Excom should examine the reasons why it is violated
and not enforced.
Second, the Executive Committee of the Associated
Students of Stanford University is not more aware of
the situation than most citizens. They are not neces
sarily closer to the problem. Every person in this
state is affected by the ever-increasing liquor prob
lem; just take a look at the record of drunken drivers
in California. Why not ask those who really are
closest to the problem—the people who deal with
juveniles: teachers, probation officers, youth workers
in the Y and other organizations—what their opinion
is?
Third, Excom is not doing its best lo see that the
law is observed, and no one can deny that fact. There
is a lot more they could do in the way of enforce
ment, if their heart were in it.
Fourth, reaching the age of 18 does not mean that
one has automatically acquired good judgment. The
judgment that is required to be a good soldier is not
that which enables one to drink intelligently. In the
army the 18-year-old does what he is told; what has
this to do with knowing how to handle liquor? Just
because an 18-year-old has matured physically and
emotionally and is thus prepared for marriage, does
not give him the ability to drink intelligently. Legally;
the 18-20-year-old is still an infant. Special pro
visions are made for him in the law; he is not assumed
to carry as much responsibility as an adult.
Fifth, there is no precedent in any state adequate
enough to show the need for lowering the drinking
age in California, and what might work in New York,
Illinois, or any other state, would not automatically
work here.
Sixth, by saying that good legislation is that which
the citizens themselves help to enforce, Excom there
by infers that since the citizens do not help to en
force the present law it is not a good one. This, too,
is illogical. Don't you agree that most people would
do pretty much as they wanted if there were no law
to prevent them from doing so or if there was no
enforcement of that law? That is exactly what 18-20-
year-olds arc doing now. It is what the speedeis on
our nation's highways do every day; they go as fast
as they want until they see a cop arorund the corner.
Whose job is it to enforce the law? What a pretty
mess our highways would be if there were no high
way patrol. Perhaps it is the enforcement that is bad
and not the law itself. Anyone who knows Artie
Samish and the liquor lobby in the California legis
lature. and how they control the Board of Equaliza
tion, will agree that the enforcement is very poor
indeed.
Excom lias no assurance whatsoever that these
young people will protect a new privilege in every
way they can. They certainly found a way to falsify
existing identification cards, and even a picture on
there will not prevent new falsification. (They found
a way to change them in Illinois.)
Finally, the argument that the lure of the forbidden
is a strong one, and that it leads to excess, is absolutely
ridiculous. Everything that is illegal is forbidden;
does this mean we should have no laws? Do luws
preventing murder and robbery lead to more rob •
beries and murders? It is not an artificial statute
which leads to disrespect for the law among Cali
fornia youth, but lack of enforcement.
California already has a serious liquor problem,
especially among young people. We must remerrfber
we in college are a'minority of the people of our own
age. Perhaps we consider ourselves mature, but there
are many 18-year-olds who are not mature. Some of
them are still in high school. Yes, the drinking prob
lem has even reached the higlj schools. Sureiy, no
one in his right mind would urge that this problem
be increased. But that is what Excom's resolution
would have you do.
I urge you to vote against the referendum on
Fiiday, for your own sake, and to save the name of
the University from association with such an illogical
and unrealistic solution to a real problem.

To the Editor:
I find that the resolution passed by Excom in favor
of lowering the drinking age is too illogical to be
accepted by anyone who is familiar with the drinking
problem in California.
First of all, the present law itself is not unrealistic.
In fact it is very realistic because it recognizes a very
terious problem. It is the enforcement of that k.w
wh'ch is unrealistic, and made so by the forces in
California which want to see the revenues from the
liquor industry remain at such a high level as they
are now. Just because it is not enforced and consist
ently violated does not make it unrealistic! Perhaps
Excom should examine the reasons why it is violated
and not enforced.
