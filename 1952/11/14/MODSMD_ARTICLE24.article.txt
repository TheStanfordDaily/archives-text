# 'Responsibility'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
It seems to us that in the discussion of the liquor
resolutibn the question of responsibility has not been
adequately We think that this question
should be the major consideration of each person who
1 votes on Friday. We believe that responsibility must
accompany freedom and that because of traffic haz
ards and social relationships there is an especially
heavy responsibility involved in drinking. Also we
must remember that the state has seen fit to licenso
liquor as a privilege, not a "right." Therefore, the

privilege to drink should be reviewed in light of the
degree of responsibility it demands.
We question whether 18 is the age of responsibility.
Granted that men ure drafted and women may marry
at age 18, but they still are not generally accorded
legal responsibility at this age. For instance, if an
18-year-old is involved in an automobile accident
his parents pay. Also, in this state a minor may not
get an automobile operator's license unless his par
ents assume financial responsibility. Moreover, the
18-year-old is not politically responsible, for he can
not vote or hold public office.
'Die problem brought up by the liquor resolution
should be viewed in its entirety. The real question is
not just whether people should be allowed to drink
at the age of eighteen, but whether they should be
permitted to assume the responsibilities of adulthood.
If we believe that eighteen years is a mature age, we
should direct our first reform at the major problem of
legal and political responsibility.
