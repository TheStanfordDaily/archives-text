To the Editor:
Concerning the ASSU Liquor Resolution to be
voted on in this Friday's election, there are major
factors which must be considered. Granted, the pres
ent situation requires an intelligent remedy, but does
every Stanford student want to be known as a backer
of this resolution?
If Stan(prd passes the proposed resolution, we are
automatically allied with (he liquor lobby and its
hackers—some of dubious intent. Whether we like
il or not, this will destroy confidence placed in Stan
ford, and its reputation, by church organizations,
alumni, PTA, and other community groups.
The publicity attached to such a student move will
snowball. For example, the faculty petition favoring
Stevenson for President gained widespread attention.
This issue, involving a moral implication, would gain
even more attention, most of which would be adverse.
One factor that has not been brought out at all
is thai Wayne Alley presented the proposed reso
lution to the Pacific Coast College Conference last
spring. It was defeated. Why bring it up again?
Is this type of action really a function of ASSU Ex
com? Granted the liquor resolution concerns college
students because the age groups coincide, but then
so does the war in Korea and Excom is taking no
action to bring that to a close.
Before voting, remember each student must be
willing to take his share of responsibility for these
consequences.
