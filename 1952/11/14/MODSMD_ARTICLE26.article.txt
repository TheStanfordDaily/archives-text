						'No' Vote

To (lie Editor:
We urge a "NO" vote on the Liquor Proposition.
It is argued (see Daily editorial, Nov. 13.) that the
present law is unworkable, because, among other
things, "young married couples . . . cannot legally
serve a glass of wine with dinner in their own
homes . . ." This statement is true, but does not
support the proposed change. The change in the law
is much broader in scope than is necessary to correct
this' "unworkability." It is not confined to "young
married couples." It would allow all persons above
the ajje of 18 to drink alcoholic beverages. Perhaps a
change, which would allow married couples above 18
to drink is in order, but this does not justify the liquor
proposition.
It is next argued that those who have served in
the armed forces are denied the privileges of adult
hood, while being forced to accept its responsibilities.
This is also true, but does not support the proposed
change. It again sweeps beyond the "unworkability."
Any inequity suffered by servicemen could be cor
rected by a change which would permit men in uni
form, with proper military identification, to drink.
Another argument in favor of the proposition goes
something like this: Many 18-year-olds can take care
of themselves. They should be allowed to drink.
Those who cannot can be "kept in check by their
parents . and if necessary the law can step in."
The obvious answer to this "reasoning" is that if the
present law is changed, there will be no basis for any
legal action. Even those who "cannot take care of
themselves" will be violating the law.
A desire to get "new and more realistic (liquor)
legislation" is commendable. A realistic way of
achieving this would be to work for changes in the
worst parts of the law first. The proposed changes do
not do this. They are as unrealistic as is the present
law. Any changes should be considered further before
the Stanford student body is committed to a collec
tive opinion. VOTE NO ON BOTH LIQUOR PROP
OSITIONS!
