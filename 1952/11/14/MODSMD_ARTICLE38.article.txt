# Their Big Gameâ€”The '52 Card Frosh
## 
### DON STEPHENS 
The protagonists aren't the
"greatest or strongest yet," but when
the Stanford and California frosh
meet tomorrow in the Stanford
bowl, the fans in attendance will see
a flashback to the rock and sock
style of the 7 20's.
Card frosh coach Bob Ghilotti, in
anticipation of a hard-fought con
test, highlighted by strong defensive
play, announced the return of hard
running halfback Jim Truher to the
starting lineup. Truher, prior to be
ing injured in the Bronco game,
sparked the 42-0 first-half deluge

win over the Brubabes in Los An
geles.
Another hard-running half, Harry
Sykes, returned to the football wars
this week. Sykes has been out since
prior to the UCLA season inaugural.
In a move to give more players an
opportunity to play, Chilotti an
nounced the two-way participation
of most offensive players, to let
more defensive players show their
offensive wares.
Against the Bears' erratic, de
fensive line, most observers expect
Ghilotti's troops to keep the Cub
defense honest with an abundance

of passes from starting quarterback
, Don Kafka to his favorite receivers,
j ends Jim Stewart and Steve Docter
! Docter is expected to display his
I stop talents as linebacker, in the
old McColl tradition.
i Don Geddes is expected to start at
offensive center in place of Tom
McKenna, who will play defensive
linebacker.
Reserve lineman Learnold Stal
lings and Dave King are ruled un
able to participate, along with sec
! oncl - string fullback Fred Hovasa
pian, by trainer Connie Jarvis.
Cal, beaten by the Trojan and

Bruin frosh, has offered an incon
sistent offense to opponents. Load
ed with outstanding backs (when
aren't they?), the Cubs have scored
82 points in three tilts while giving
up '67. Tl#y can score freely but
they evidently haven't the defense
] to hold a winning advantage.
Jerry Drew, the Cubs' counter
j part of Jim Truher with his ability
to power up the middle and skirt
j the ends, is expected to carry the
main offensive running load.
Rated a diamond-in-the-rough,
quarterback Hugh Maguire is rated
an outstanding ball-handler, while

lacking in consistent passing abil- !
ity. But in this freshman Big Game, j
he may come through with a Frank- :
ie Albert.

bowl, the fans in attendance will see
a flashback to the rock and sock

Card frosh coach Bob Ghilotti, in
anticipation of a hard-fought con
test, highlighted by strong defensive
play, announced the return of hard
running halfback Jim Truher to the
starting lineup. Truher, prior to be

sparked the 42-0 first-half deluge

In a move to give more players an
