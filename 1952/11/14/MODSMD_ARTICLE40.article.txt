EUGENE, Ore.—lt'll be old home day on the Farm for Len Casanova
Saturday when he brings his University of Oregon Webfoots to Palo Alto.
And the last time a Cas-coached team invaded Stanford Stadium, it lett with
j a 7-7 standoff. His Orange Bowl-bound Santa Clara Broncs were credited
I with that neat trick three years ago. .
Whether the 1952 Ducks will meet with the same success as the 194!)
Broncos is problematical. Oregon simply doesn't have the depth or per
! sonnel to stack up inan-for-man with that bygone Santa Clara eleven.
But that doesn't mean that we are lacking good players. Up here in the
rain country we think that we more than keep up with the Joneses — and
the Stockerts. Morleys, Blacks and Barkers for that matter. For instance,
there's a boy by the* name of Monte Brethauer. a lithe 172 pound, six-foot
one-inch end, who can do everything with a football except eat it.
Monte, a senior, is America's foremost pass catcher. There isn't a gridder
: on any NCAA team in the country who has hauled in more pitches than
1 Brethauer's 94. Whats' more. Brethauer is only 12 shy of Bill McColl's
; three-year national record of 106, set in 1951. Glue-fingered Monte is an
equal number of receptions behind Ed Barker's total of 4G for a single season.
Last Saturday against Washington State, Brethauer, who doubles as a
defensive halfback, recovered a Cougar fumble, intercepted a Burkhart
pass and pulled down nine forward tosses which—you guessed it—tied Ike
Jones' seasonal mark set against Cal.
The Webfoots will rest most of their victory hopes squarely on the
shoulders of Sophomore Quarterback George Shaw, who nearly cast his lot
with you Stanfords. Shaw measured up and lately has developed into
something of a triple-threater. Two weeks ago he had never punted in
collegiate football—now he has gotten off four boots for 151 yards.
Shaw, brother of Tom Shaw, ex-Stanford quarterback, vintage '48-50,
and Jack Shaw, Associated sportscaster, is probably the runningest "T"
general to hit the coast since "Bootleg" Bob Celeri was tossing 'em for Cal
a couple of years ago.
Then there is Tom Novikoff, burly Duck fullback, who can go full
throttle on the end sweeps—if he gets the blocking. Novikoff. an all-Junior
College All-American two years straight at Los Angeles City College, is
the leading Webfoot rusher. Ted Anderson, who has been afflicted with
fumblitis of late, should get the call at the left half spot. Anderson, a 440-
man, is dynamic in an open field. He and Hal Dunham teamed up on an 84-
yard pass play against COP.
Opposite Brethauer on the line is Ron Lyman, a converted fullback, who
has done a great job. The remainder of the starting offensive line, weighing
slightly under 200 pounds, is as follows; Hal Reeve, left tackle; Jim Jacques,
left guard; Ron Pheister, center; Emmett Williams, right guard; and Don
Hedgepeth, right tackle.
The Webfoots have already had the experience of running into a team
that had been flattened the week before so they will hardly be taking this
one for granted. Casanova fears that the Indians, like Washington, will be
an angry outfit tomorrow.
Although the Ducks are on the upswing they'll have to mend their fences
even more if they are to stop the explosive quick openers whiqh the Cards
dish up. Oregon's pass defense isn't the best in the world, either, and you
can be dead certain'that Casanova is expecting an aerial attack from the
| Indians.
Past records have proven that Casanova teams fare well against Cali
fornia. UCLA and Stanford. Last year the Ducks held the Indians to a
27-20 decision—this year it was Oregon 6. UCLA 13 and Cal 41. Oregon 7.
| But the half-time score of the Bear-I)uck contest was 7-7.
Cas knows the Indians and it may pay off—for Oregon.
