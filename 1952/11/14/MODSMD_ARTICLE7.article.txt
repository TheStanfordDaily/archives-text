Following are the election state
ments:
Carol Folsom
Stanford is both unique and for
tunate in having its judiciary body
composed of students. I feel that
Women's Council should be well
understood by all the students.. I
would like to see Council publicize,
in so far as possible, its interpreta
tions, its decisions, and the reasons
behind its decisions.
Tom Ellick
I consider it an honor to be nom
inated for Men's Council and will
consider it an even greater privi
lege if you, the individual members
of the ASSU, elect, me to the office.
I don't believe in making a lot of
campaign promises but I certainly
do believe in doing the best job that
I possibly can in any undertaking
which I may pursue or in any posi
tion for which 112 may be chosen.
If I am elected to Men's Council,
I will carry out any and all of the

rcsponsibililics of the office to the
utmost of my abilities. .
Hill Dickinson
As a candidate for a position on
Men's Council, I am fully aware of
the time and effort required, and
cognizant, of the responsibilities in
volved. In Men's Council I would
like to correlate the interests of the
students and the school by adher
ing to the spirit of the law and by
approaching the questions brought
before Council with not only fair
ness, but an eye to maintaining
realistic but high standards fox-
Men's Council.
Diannc (Ratlin
Our social regulations should rep
resent the spirit and standard of
conduct desired by all the wotnee of
Stanford. Complete mutual under
standing and co-operation between
Women's Council and all the women
in formulating and administering
these regulations is essential. 1
would strive to give greater recog
nition to controversies and criti
cisms so that the regulations be
kept realistic and flexible.
Karla Bntlcr
I believe that a Women's Council
member should try to put herself in
the position of each person whose

case is reviewer), as well as carry
out the regulations set up by AWS,
and the ideals of the Honor Code
and Fundamental Standard. Contin
ued emphasis on education is even
more important, 1 feel, for many
violations arc direct results af in
sufficient understanding of the so
cial regulations.
Jerry Thayer
Stanford University has always
been known for the high moral con
duct of its students. I would like to
serve my school and my fellow stu
dents as a member of Mens Coun
cil. I will do my beist to continue
to increase the fine reputation, so
ably guarded by the Men's and
Women's Council.
Belly Pierce
The opportunity for continued
growth in our social regulations is
unlimited at Stanford. I would like
to represent the Stanford women on
Women's Council, ancl to continue
our liberal policies through educa
tion on. and interpretation of, our
social regulations, Honor Code, and
Fundamental Standard which were
set up by the students and which
occupy such an important part in
our Stanford life.
