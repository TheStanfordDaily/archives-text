WASHINGTON, Nov. 16 (UP)
— Administrative authori ties
close to President Truman were
quoted as urging President-elect
Dwight Eisenhower to announce
his cabinet appointments within
tv/o weeks.
The officials said it. was impera
tive that Eisenhower appointees be
fully briefed on present adminis.tra
tion activities, particularly in the
foreign relations field.
A meeting of Eisenhower and
President Truman is scheduled
for Tuesday.
Administration officials also said
they hone Eisenhower's meeting
with the President will prompt
him tf) warn the nation not to ex
pect "miracles" from his forth
coming Korean trip.
They said the Korean war and the
truce crisis will l.r by far most
important tnbjccl discussed by the
President-elect and Mr. Truman at.
their .momentous White House con
ference. They predicted Eisenhower
will yet a rather pessimistic report
on both.
Eisenhower warned in the latter
stages of his campaign that he did
not expect to work a miracle in
Korea. But Democratic officials . aid
the warning was lost in the heat of
the campaign and hoped lie would
repeat it in a "definite" formal
statement now.
These authorities said manj
persons, hoth in this country and
abroad, still believe that Eisen
hower's p e r so n a I investigation
will end the war. The present ad
ministration sees no possibility of
an early end, barring a sudden
change in United Nations truce

efforts.
Administration officials said they
fear that without advance words of
caution, Eisenhower's trip might be
recorded as a "failure" if the Ko
rean war docs not end quickly. If
this lnbel was mistpkenly put, on !
the trip, they said, it might:

1- Play into the hands of the i
Communists and prompt them to re- j
double their military efforts and j
stand firm against an armistice.
2—Reduce free world support for
the war by touching off new doubts,
questions, and discouragement
among the Allies.

Mr. Truman invited Eisenhower
here to map an orderly transition
from Democratic to Republican con
trol of the government Jan. 20. The
two men will "meet privately and
then step into the White House cab
inet room for,.a conferencc with
their advisers.
