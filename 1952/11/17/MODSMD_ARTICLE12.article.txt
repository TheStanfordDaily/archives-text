## Indians Are Beaten By Oregon's Spirit 
### DON WEBSTER 
"You can lose all the others, but if you bca! Col your season
is a success."
Such was the spirit of many Stanford fans after Saturday's de
feat at the hands of Oregon, 21-20. And surely it did seem as if
the Duck contest was nothing more than a semi-final.

Despite the Indian defeat on the
scoreboard, statistics showed Stan
ford with a predominant edge. They
pounded out 22 first downs to Ore

gon's 16, and were outgained on the
ground by only 13 yards, l(!fl to 173.
Several losses by quarterback Jack
Gebert knocked the Indian net yard
age down considerably, however. In
the air, tlicy completed 21 passes for
321 yards, well over twice the Duck
total.
This great aerial show, by the
way, established three new school
records. Added to "those 21 com
pletions for .'521 yards which
■-mashed all previous marks tor a
Stanford quarterback, the 39 at
tempted passes is also a new figure.
Oddly the Conference records for
pass attempts and completions was
se( earlier in (he year by another
man on the same field with (iebert.
That \\ as Oregon's George Shaw.
Against California, Shaw attempted
In pass 53 times and 23 of those
heaves were caught.
Thus, (Jehert's debut with the
varsity must rank with the sen
sational.
There were several disappoint
ments besides the final score, though.
Two injuries, to Chuck Esscgian and
Len Mayrhofer, handieaped Stanford
through the game. Esscgian will be
ready for the Big Game' and Mayr
hofer, along halfbacks Skip
Crist and Ron Cook, remains open
to question.
Another thing that Stanford fans
can be happy about is the perform
ance of Gebert. Starting his first
game, after Bob Garrett was declared
out for the season last week, he ap
peared a capable field captain Satur
day. "He's as good as any of Cal's

Here's how the scoring occurred
Saturday:
1. Gebert faded back to pass,
then handed oft' to Mathias who
swept around end for 22 yards.
Stanford 7, Oregon 0.
2. NovikolT plunged through the
center of Stanford's line for two
yards. Conversion good on a pass
from Shaw to Anderson. Stanford
