# Back to Fundamentals
## 
### 
Another move has been made at Stanford to
jay down strongly delineated lines of respon
sibility where good taste is concerned.
Prompted by the off color content of the Nov.
7 Homecoming Rally, Excom last week:
1. Made the Rally Committee chairman form
ally responsible for the "content of future rallies.
2. Assigned the persons who had either read
or planned the rally script to a committee which
will formulate policies of good taste to guide the
planners of future rallies.
We believe Excom made a wise decision
in not recommending suspension or the old
reliable Con Home hours. The persons re
sponsible for the rally were in a sense-victims
of some administrative confusion; they have
already been subjected to the white heat of
adverse public opinion; they had better be
assigned to a constructive task which will
help avoid a repetition of their lapse.
However, we see Excom's action as part of a
whole trend at Stanford to codify, to delineate,
to lay down definite lines of responsibility.
Last year the Chaparral changed its Constitu
tion to set up a Review Board which would take
the pressure of responsibility off the editor. Ef
forts have been made for several years to
the Fundamental Standard and to lay down defi
nite rules of conduct. •
Some of this codifying is good. It can prove
a great administrative boon and insure that
ther-» are no doubts about the lines of respon
sibility.
But we deplore the lack of faith in the in
dividual that we believe it shows. And we de
plore even more the fact that this lack of faith
seems well founded.
Stanford began by basing its social conduct
on the "Fundamental Standard":
"Students are expected to show both within

and without the University such respect for
order, morality, end personal honor, and the
rights of others as is demanded of good citi
zens."
And we believe that this
by all, should still be enough.
We find it hard to see how anyone can recon
cile "order'* v/ith throwing tomatoes at rallies,
"morality" with presenting plainly indecent
skits, or "personal honor" with cheating on li
brary cards.
We suggest as a solution to the incidents
which arouse the public's/ wrath, not a lot of
strictly-worded rules, but a return Jo the in
dividual's responsibility for the reputation of
himself and his university.
