# About the Election

Bitter voices are still being heard to proclaim,
"I didn't get to vote Friday; they ran out of
ballots."
We'd like to ask the bitter ones not to feel
that way.
Election Board was guilty of no crime other
than a lack of optimism. They had no precedent
under which to expect the record vote which
emptied'the election booths of ballots by early
afternoon.
Burdened by a shortage of workers and some
last-minute changes in top personnel, Election
Board is working now to set up a new election
Wednesday. There'll be a completely new vote
on the Liquor Resolution and the candidates for
Men's and V/omens' Council, as well as for
the sophomore, junior, senior, and graduate
representatives to Excom.
So forget about your bitterness and get out
and vote Wednesday.
