# BULL SESSION
## 
### DICK MANSFIELD 
Hard as nails and full of tricks, Rimrock Dade
emerged from the Old Southwest, where he'd been
a'ridin' broncs and a'bulldoggin' steers since he was
four, and came to Stanford University. Immediately
he became the mainstay of the left side of the fresh
man line, was assigned to a position on the hashing
line requiring co-ordination, i.e., manipulating the
fried eggs, and used to entertain the boys by tearing
Fncina doors off their hinges and flinging them into
the court.

But one morning Rimrock
Dade. 213 pounds of he-man, was
under the weather. He snapped
at his roommates and pushed
away the trough after having
eaten only two helpings. Rim
rock had a hangnail. "Better not
turn out, Dade," said the coach,
"until you let them do something
for that over at the Health Serv
ice."
So Rimrock went over to the

Health Service. "Get a hangnail," he told the doctor.
"Gimme a piece of tape to put on it."
"Now, young man," said the doctor, producing
a stethescope, "just calm down. Don't worry, he
cause there is really nothing to worry about. With
modern precautions and modem techniques . . ."
Kimrock was puzzled. Never, even in his occas
ional brawls in Tombstone, had Kimrock worried
about anvthing. "Aw, it isn't much of a hang
nail . . he said.
The doctor had listened to him breath deeply, taken
his pulse, looked down his throat, and was now
scurrying about. "Got to have a tetanus booster!"
he was muttering. He found an immense needle and
Rave Rimrock a tetanus booster. Rimrock, who had
been tentatively identifying tetanus boosters with

gila monsters, was beginning to get edgy. "Look,
Doc," he said, "I got to get to turnout. We play USC,
Those Beasts, Saturday, and we gotta be ready . . ."
"Easy," said the doctor. "Avoid tension. Don't let
shock overcome you! Does that hangnail have a
throbbing, sick feeling?"
The hangnail didn't have any feeling at all, since
the tetanus booster was virtually taking Rimrock's
arm off at the elbow. This routine was beginning
to get on his nerves. Now the doctor picked up a
mace.
"Let's see how your reflexes are," he said, and
clouted Rimrock on the kneecap. Rimroek kicked
him in the teeth. The doctor frowned.
"Bad!".he said. The frown deepened, and li I tie
lines of worry appeared on his forehead. Rimrock
was til to belied. The doctor leaped up and got a
bottle lilted with a purple substance.
"Now, I want you to keep in mind that this is a
minor thing, very minor," said the doctor. "Nothing
to it, with modern precautions . . . Now, where is
that hypodermic needle? . .
Rimrock Dade, physical wreck, crept out of the
Health Service a long two hours after he had en
tered. The boys back at the dorm noted that his
booming laugh was missing. Instead, Rimrock had
acquired a racking cough. His hand was unsteady
us he slung the fried eggs. On Saturday, USC ran
nine straight cutbacks over Dade's prone form at
tackle before the coach took him out.
He had complexes. He had phobias. The words
Health Service led him to push his fist through walls.
At the end of Fall Quarter, totally beaten, Rimrock
Dade climbed on his bronc and rode back into the
Old Southwest, where a man is a man, a hangnail
is a hangnail, and modern precautions means hedging
Canasta bets.

us he slung the fried eggs. On Saturday, USC ran
nine straight cutbacks over Dade's prone form at
tackle before the coach took him out.
He had complexes. He had phobias. The words
Health Service led him to push his fist through walls.
At the end of Fall Quarter, totally beaten, Rimrock
Dade climbed on his bronc and rode back into the
Old Southwest, where a man is a man, a hangnail
is a hangnail, and modern precautions means hedging
Canasta bets.

Hard as nails and full of tricks, Rimrock Dade
emerged from the Old Southwest, where he'd been
a'ridin' broncs and a'bulldoggin' steers since he was
four, and came to Stanford University. Immediately
he became the mainstay of the left side of the fresh
man line, was assigned to a position on the hashing
line requiring co-ordination, i.e., manipulating the
fried eggs, and used to entertain the boys by tearing
Fncina doors off their hinges and flinging them into
the court.

But one morning Rimrock
Dade. 213 pounds of he-man, was
under the weather. He snapped
at his roommates and pushed
away the trough after having
eaten only two helpings. Rim
rock had a hangnail. "Better not
turn out, Dade," said the coach,
"until you let them do something
for that over at the Health Serv
ice."
So Rimrock went over to the

Health Service. "Get a hangnail," he told the doctor.
"Gimme a piece of tape to put on it."
"Now, young man," said the doctor, producing
a stethescope, "just calm down. Don't worry, he
cause there is really nothing to worry about. With
modern precautions and modem techniques . . ."
Kimrock was puzzled. Never, even in his occas
ional brawls in Tombstone, had Kimrock worried
about anvthing. "Aw, it isn't much of a hang
nail . . he said.
The doctor had listened to him breath deeply, taken
his pulse, looked down his throat, and was now
scurrying about. "Got to have a tetanus booster!"
he was muttering. He found an immense needle and
Rave Rimrock a tetanus booster. Rimrock, who had
been tentatively identifying tetanus boosters with

gila monsters, was beginning to get edgy. "Look,
Doc," he said, "I got to get to turnout. We play USC,
Those Beasts, Saturday, and we gotta be ready . . ."
"Easy," said the doctor. "Avoid tension. Don't let
shock overcome you! Does that hangnail have a
throbbing, sick feeling?"
The hangnail didn't have any feeling at all, since
the tetanus booster was virtually taking Rimrock's
arm off at the elbow. This routine was beginning
to get on his nerves. Now the doctor picked up a
mace.
"Let's see how your reflexes are," he said, and
clouted Rimrock on the kneecap. Rimroek kicked
him in the teeth. The doctor frowned.
"Bad!".he said. The frown deepened, and li I tie
lines of worry appeared on his forehead. Rimrock
was til to belied. The doctor leaped up and got a
bottle lilted with a purple substance.
"Now, I want you to keep in mind that this is a
minor thing, very minor," said the doctor. "Nothing
to it, with modern precautions . . . Now, where is
that hypodermic needle? . .
Rimrock Dade, physical wreck, crept out of the
Health Service a long two hours after he had en
tered. The boys back at the dorm noted that his
booming laugh was missing. Instead, Rimrock had
acquired a racking cough. His hand was unsteady
