# On Death Sentence
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I would like to comment on Mr. Barlow's letter
Wednesday about the death sentence of Ethel and
Julius Rosenberg. •
A Suoreme Court review of such a serious and
unprecedented case is certainly warranted.
There are two points to be considered:
First, the Rosenbergs were accused of committing
a crime in 1945. If they were tried at that time, before
the cold war, and found guilty, surely they would
not have been given the death sentence. If the
death sentence, then, would have been cruel and
unjust, the same sentence, today, is cruel and unjust.
For the sr.' — of justice in the American tradition, the
Supreme Court should fully review this case.
The second point to be considered is that according
to the reports of the case, the only pertinent evidence
which led to the conviction of the Rosenbergs was
the uncorraborated testimony of David Greenglass
(considered as insufficient evidence in some courts).
Greenglass confessed to stealing secrets after he was
apprehended, and later accused the Rosenbergs of

being the leaders in the "conspiracy." The Rosen
berg's have maintained their innocence. Greenglass
was sentenced to only 15 years. The Rosenbergs
were sentenced to death.
In view of the evidence, the death sentence is very
harsh. It would seem that, especially because of the
sentence, they are entitled to have the case reviewed
by the Supreme Court.
In as much as the Supreme Court has stayed the
execution in order that another appeal for review be
filed, letters may be written to President Truman or
the Department of Justice urging that the government
support rather than oppose a review.
