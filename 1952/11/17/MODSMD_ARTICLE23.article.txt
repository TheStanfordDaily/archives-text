To the Editor:
It is gratifying to read your "Roses and Thorns"
editorial in my paper this morning (The Daily, Nov.
11).
I'm one of the audience at the Friday night rally
who, to put it mildly, was very unhappy.
I was under the impression that the Stanford Stu
dent Body was a cross-section of the finest young
people in the country and was shocked, not only at
the quality of the entertainment, but that there was
apparently no protest from the students, which would
have been expressed in embarrassment and refraining
to applaud or laugh.
It seems to me the students were to blame, along
with the planners of the entertainment, who appar
ently knew their audience.
Is there a need for courage on the part of those
who were unhappy to take a stand for right think
ing and good taste at all times, and perhaps" greater
support from those who shape the character of Stan
ford?
Thanks for your protest.
