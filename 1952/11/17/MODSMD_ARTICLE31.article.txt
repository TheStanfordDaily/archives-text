### 
In what Farm rooters hope will not be an omen for the Big
Game at Berkeley this week, the California freshmen defeated
the Stanford frosh 20 to 14 at the Stadium Saturday morning.
Downing the Papooses for the first time since 1941, the Cubs
v/ere paced by the passing of quarterback Hugh McGuire and the

running of hallback Ted Granger <
McGuire completed 12 of 18 ae
rials tor 15)8 yards, while Granger |
tallied one touchdown and romped j
lor 75 yards before he was forced'to ;
leave the game because of an in- j
jury.
Cal tcok the opening kickoff and
marched 64 yards in 11 plays to ac- I
count for the game's first TD. Gran- \
!>er scored the marker from 21 yards
out on an end sweep. Ed Brandt j
converted.
The Cardbabes evened things up
midway in the second period on a J
71-yard drive which required five I
plays. Highlight of the sequence j
was a 53-yard pass from Don Kafka j
to Harry Svkes. Jim Truher went
over from trie six and Dorsey At
kinson kicked the point.
The Cubs went ahead for good j
half-way in the third quarter on an ;
81-yard march. Fullback Don Le
bedeff smashed across the goal line j
from the two, fumbled, and tackle i

points. Brandt's conversion was
wide.
The Berkeley frosh took 1G plays
from their own 28 to account for !
their final tally in the fourth quar
ter. McGuire tossed a six - yard
screen pass to end Ed Phelan to
make it 20-7.
Undaunted, the Papooses took to j
the air in an effort to get back in j
the ball game. Quarterback Jerry j
Gustafson attempted seven passes in j
a row and completed four and the j
Indian frosh moved to score from !
their own 23. Climaxer, which came |
with but 50 seconds, was to end Jim
Stewart for 47 yards. Stewart took
the toss on the Cub 17 and rambled j

Hoping to pull the game out, tht
Card frosh tried an onside kick, but
Cal recovered on their own and
McGuire ran out the clock on quar
terback .sneaks.
The frosh finished with a 1-3 rec
ord, while the Cubs had a 2-2 mark
