ranks, of Rose Bowl aspirants.

California as even as two teams can
be in the records. Both have scored
eight victories; both have won five
Pacific Coast Conference games.
It was the first time in the his
tory of the two schools that they
have come down» to the wire un
beaten with the Conference cham

football-fevered fans all awaited the

their television sets to witness the
game.

high for their coaches.

long career that began in the South
and was transplanted West four
years ago. For Jess Hill it was a
meteoric climax for a coach in his
second season as the head man at
his alma mater.
Hill and Sanders, in typical coach
fashion, extolled each other's teams,
carefully airing their "fears" and
pointing out the strength of their
rivals.
But there were few who would
disagree that it was an even con
test, although the odds makers may
make one of them a favorite by a
point or so,
