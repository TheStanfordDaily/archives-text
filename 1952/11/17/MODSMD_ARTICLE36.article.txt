# 'NICE TO WIN'
## Casanova, Ducks Elated After 2nd Win of Season 
### PHIL BERMAN 
"It's sure nice to win. It's sure nice to win." That's all a gleeful
Len Casanova, his voice barely audible above the din, could say
in the dressing room after his Oregon Ducks had upset Stanford.
"It's sure nice to even be ahead," added the personable coach,
completely surrounded by throngs of alumni, friends, and happy

but weary footballers.
"I haven't had that feeling for so
long," he said with an obvious sigh
of relief. Casanova's Oregon elevens
have won but three games the past
two seasons.
Soon the furor died down, and
Casanova tried to pick out some of
the highlights of his team's triumph.
"I thought both our offensive
ends, Ron Lyman and Monte Bret
hauer, played good ball," he said.
"We figured Stanford would be
watching Brethauer, and he did a
great job of faking. That left Ly
man open for passes."
High praise also went to defensive
end Emery Barnes, tackle Hal
Reeve, and guard Hal Simmons.
"Reeve is only a sophomore, but
he played a great game, while Sim
mons did well on defense. Barnes
also played well, considering he was
going on one leg after he got hurt
in the first quarter," Casanova stat
ed.
The Duck coach said that he
couldn't say much about the Stan
ford team "because he was so busy
on the bench," but he did think
highly of Bob" Mathias and Jack
Gebert.
"Gebert did a good job," Casa

nova said. 'He had to pass many
times during the game, and he did
it well, while Mathias is a good
boy."
Len begged off naming the best
team he's played this year, saying
that his squad has been plagued by
so many injuries that they haven't
been at full strength for any one of
their games.
Casanova did say, though, not to
discount Stanford in the Big Game
on Saturday, adding he had "seen
too many of those games, and any
thing can happen."
Three Oregonians were hurt dur
ing the contest. Barnes, as men
tioned before, hurt a leg, while half
Cece Hodges, who scored the game
winning touchdown, had a bruised
rib, and linebacker John Adams re
injured a shoulder.

injured a shoulder.
"It's sure nice to win. It's sure nice to win." That's all a gleeful
Len Casanova, his voice barely audible above the din, could say
in the dressing room after his Oregon Ducks had upset Stanford.
"It's sure nice to even be ahead," added the personable coach,
completely surrounded by throngs of alumni, friends, and happy

but weary footballers.
"I haven't had that feeling for so
long," he said with an obvious sigh
of relief. Casanova's Oregon elevens
have won but three games the past
two seasons.
Soon the furor died down, and
Casanova tried to pick out some of
the highlights of his team's triumph.
"I thought both our offensive
ends, Ron Lyman and Monte Bret
hauer, played good ball," he said.
"We figured Stanford would be
watching Brethauer, and he did a
great job of faking. That left Ly
man open for passes."
High praise also went to defensive
end Emery Barnes, tackle Hal
Reeve, and guard Hal Simmons.
"Reeve is only a sophomore, but
he played a great game, while Sim
mons did well on defense. Barnes
also played well, considering he was
going on one leg after he got hurt
in the first quarter," Casanova stat
ed.
The Duck coach said that he
couldn't say much about the Stan
ford team "because he was so busy
on the bench," but he did think
highly of Bob" Mathias and Jack
Gebert.
"Gebert did a good job," Casa

nova said. 'He had to pass many
times during the game, and he did
it well, while Mathias is a good
boy."
Len begged off naming the best
team he's played this year, saying
that his squad has been plagued by
so many injuries that they haven't
been at full strength for any one of
their games.
Casanova did say, though, not to
discount Stanford in the Big Game
on Saturday, adding he had "seen
too many of those games, and any
thing can happen."
Three Oregonians were hurt dur
ing the contest. Barnes, as men
tioned before, hurt a leg, while half
Cece Hodges, who scored the game
winning touchdown, had a bruised
rib, and linebacker John Adams re
injured a shoulder.
