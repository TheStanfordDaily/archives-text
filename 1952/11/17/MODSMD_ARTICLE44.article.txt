for the '52 Big Game Gaieties.
Members of the Gaieties east

Big Game Gaieties is the biggest
student production of the Stanford
year. And this is a story about how
this year's Gaieties was put togeth
er.
First, last spring, Ram's Head
held a contest for script, sonff, and
skit ideas. Over the summer Joan
Ilunt, Gaieties director, and her
production stafT elected bv Ram's
Head, compiled and edited these
| ideas. But this was iust the be
ginning of a long with type
writer and blue pencil. Up to the
! last week, material was being
| added, cut, and changed.
Casting began at the beginning of
j fall quarter. Approximately 250
j students tried out for the 65 parts.
Rehearsals began in small
lumps. There were separate re
hearsals for the song and dance
numbers, the fillers, and each of
the skits. The rehearsals were
[ held wherever space could be
I found—in the women's gym, at
the Knoll, in Woodpecker Lodge,
and, when no place else was avail

able, on street corners.
Memorial Auditorium, where the |
show will actually be staged, was |
not available except for reccnt re- I
hearsals.
Meanwhile the crew went to work I
making sets in the back shop. The !
spare there is limited, and, while
they worked, other crews were
working on sets for other shows.
Another part of the crew worked
on costumes. Over 200 costumes arc
being used in the show this year.
"Tech" rehearsal, traditionally j
dreaded by the cast, was last 'Fri
day. This is a bedlamic procedure
in which scenes arc gone over again |
and again so that the technical di
rector can get the spotlights and

| technical efTccts just the way he
| wants them.
Two dress rehearsals, Saturday
afternoon and last night, provided
the last chances for polishing. To
morrow the show opens.
Gaieties is big business for Stan
ford. This year's show cost $3,000;
the maximum proceeds it could
make arc $7,000. Its profits will be
used to put on other Ram's Head
productions such as the One-Acts
and Spring Show which don't pay
for themselves.


SOCRATES ATTENDS A GAIETIES REHEARSAL—Yesterday
afternoon, one of the Gaieties cast members brought his cocker
pup, Socrates, to a dress rehearsal of Big Game Gaieties. Here
Socrates visits the orchestra pit to watch Ted Lassagne play the
piano. Socrates also went into the makeup and dressing rooms.
His only comment was, "I am impressed."

Casting began at the beginning of
j fall quarter. Approximately 250
j students tried out for the 65 parts.
Rehearsals began in small
lumps. There were separate re
hearsals for the song and dance
numbers, the fillers, and each of
the skits. The rehearsals were
[ held wherever space could be
I found—in the women's gym, at
the Knoll, in Woodpecker Lodge,
and, when no place else was avail

able, on street corners.
Memorial Auditorium, where the |
show will actually be staged, was |
not available except for reccnt re- I
hearsals.
Meanwhile the crew went to work I
making sets in the back shop. The !
spare there is limited, and, while
they worked, other crews were
working on sets for other shows.
Another part of the crew worked
on costumes. Over 200 costumes arc
being used in the show this year.
"Tech" rehearsal, traditionally j
dreaded by the cast, was last 'Fri
day. This is a bedlamic procedure
in which scenes arc gone over again |
and again so that the technical di
rector can get the spotlights and

| technical efTccts just the way he
| wants them.
Two dress rehearsals, Saturday
afternoon and last night, provided
the last chances for polishing. To
morrow the show opens.
Gaieties is big business for Stan
ford. This year's show cost $3,000;
the maximum proceeds it could
make arc $7,000. Its profits will be
used to put on other Ram's Head
productions such as the One-Acts
and Spring Show which don't pay
for themselves.


SOCRATES ATTENDS A GAIETIES REHEARSAL—Yesterday
afternoon, one of the Gaieties cast members brought his cocker
pup, Socrates, to a dress rehearsal of Big Game Gaieties. Here
Socrates visits the orchestra pit to watch Ted Lassagne play the
piano. Socrates also went into the makeup and dressing rooms.
His only comment was, "I am impressed."
