WASHINGTON, Nov. Hi (UP)
—The Atomic Energy Commis
sion announced today that .suc
cessful hycrogen bomb test.i have
been held at its isolated Eniwe
tolc proving grounds in the
Pacific. It said scientists were
pleased with the results.
Though the AEC reports con
tained but scanty details, il is
understood from service men at
the dramatic tx'ene that the
mighty bomb was discharged
Nov. 1.
One observer, writing home to
his wife, said the bomb was deto

in six hours after the blast, he
wrote, the island disappeared.
"Within six hours an island that
once had palm trees and coco
nuts had now nothing," he said.
While the commission did
not say il in so many words,
its announcement made clear
that A ni e r i c a n weaponeers
have exploded the world's first
hydrogen bomb. The wording
of the announcement suggest

cd that several ini|(ht have
been set oft - .
The commission accompanied
its report on the super-secret
experiments with a warning to
Riissin that tJie United States
v will continue "its studies look
in,-; toward the development"
of the awesome 11-homb.
It. said the lack of any "effec

ments for the control" of atomic
armaments demands it.
Simultaneously, AEC Chair

gation.; are under way "leading
to possible disciplinary action or
prosecution" for members of the
test task forcp who sent home
