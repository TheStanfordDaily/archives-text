# The 						Only Way We Can Win
## 
### 
When we v/ere elected editor, there's one
thing we swore we'd never do: v/rite an edi
torial on school spirit.
But now Eig Game is only a week away, and
we're suddenly realizing that this is our last
chance to see Stanford get back the Axe.
We remember the three Big Games we've
$een. We remember the three times we've been
so very sure Stanford would win, and the three
times we've been disappointed.
But even more clearly we remember the
greatest game we've seen in four football sea
sons: Stanford's victory over SC last year.
Sure, it was a great game. We had the Ker
korian-McColl combination; we had Mathias'
86-yard touchdown run.
But strangely enough, that's not what we re
member. We remember the wonderful intan
gible known as "spirit."
The game was played in Los Angeles' mar

velous Coliseum. And the Stanford rooting sec
tion was jammed with a lot of kids who really
cared. We played the game as much as any
player on the field. For a week afterwards, we
bore a bruise on our arm where we came down
against the back of a seat after jumping into the
air with excitement. And for a week afterwards,
our voice was hoarse from shouting. We'd
barely any voice left when the time came for
the second Axe yell, but we shouted louder
than we ever had before in our lives.
SC was the favorite in that game, just Cal
will probably be this weekend. But—and we
firmly believe this—the psychological support
made the difference.
That's why v/e're breaking our own private
precedent. That's why we're asking you to care
this weekend, to share with the team your will
to win. For we believe that this will be the
only way to get the Axe back.
