'56 has been a little slow in picking up those
Eig Game Bonfire sticks. At least that's the
report we've been getting.
For instance, yesterday at 4 p.m. only two
men had turned out to gather wood and begin
raising that pyre to the 85-foot goal. If the fresh
men expect to beat the 1951 goal they have a
long way to go.
We admit that rainy weather has slowed
down the construction of the traditional bonfire.
We admit that the weather has been cold, even
ir, ihe afternoons. However, the bonfire is tra

ditionally the job of the freshmen and previous
classes have had more obstacles to -fight.
The freshmen have been receiving the co
operation of their dorm managers in arranging
staggered meal hours and lots of hot water for
showers for the boys who work into the night.
Thursday isn't very far away. There's lots
of work to be done—work that cannot be done
by one or two men. Now is the time for all
freshmen to come to the aid of their bonfire.
See you at Lake Lag.
