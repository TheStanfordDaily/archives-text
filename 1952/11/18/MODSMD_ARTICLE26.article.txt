### BOB STETSON 
There comes a time in the life of every young
first-year man when he must ferment apple eider in
his room. This is one of the primary phases in the
development of an undergraduate student, the "sine
qua non" of a college education.
One of the first first-year men to come into a
potent and virile manhood was my roommate, Greg
Danninger. His experiment, which he took quite

seriously, had careful "controls"
and was dutifully observed with
meticulous regularity.
Science has a romantic appeal
to first-year men. Our room was
filled day and night during the
week-long experiment with sci
entists from every nook and
cranny of picturesque Encina
Hall. Sleep and study were im
possibilities in the room as the
experiment drew into its final

Red-eyed from loss of sleep, Greg held seminars
every hour explaining the phenomenon of nature
to the throngs of scientists which milled restlessly
j'bcut our cubicle, awaiting the process of hydro
genation to reach completion.
"This is a controlled scientific experiment testing
the effect of pressure, temperature, and yeast upon
apple cider," Greg would explain. The scientists often
played cat.'h with the deflated football of my other
roommate as a nervous release, breaking clocks, light
bulbs, phonographs, mirrors (cursing them with seven
years of misfortune), typewriters, etc.
, By the time the day arrived for testing the experi
ment (part four in the scientific rhethod), the scientists

had gone outride to play catch on the lawn with the
football.
Greg: dramatically broke the seal (a Mickey Mouse
balloon) on the iug which had served dutifully to
prevent the cider from oxidizing into vinegar. His
swollen eyes peered intensely into the murky depths
of quantity X.
Perceiving the stimulating aroma of quantity X, the
scientists desisted their seven-day game of catch
and scampered lightly up the three flights of stairs
to our laboratory (room 330 Encina).
Forcing his drooping lips into a triumphant smile,
Greg spoke out to the mob, "I know you all would
like to volunteer to test the effect of Fleisehmann's
Yeast upon Harvest Day apple cider, so will just the
unmarried men step forward?"
Jim Reid slunk to the fore and proceeded to chug
a-lug.
The mcb awaited judgment with bated breath.
"Tell us all about quantity X. What does it taste
like?" 4
Composing himself and choosing his words with
care, Hero Reid spoke unto the masses.
"Urina equi!"
Science.

Thoughts are hut steamboats
Like holts of yellow lightning,

Screaming, screaming, screaming,

roommate as a nervous release, breaking clocks, light
bulbs, phonographs, mirrors (cursing them with seven
years of misfortune), typewriters, etc.
, By the time the day arrived for testing the experi
ment (part four in the scientific rhethod), the scientists

had gone outride to play catch on the lawn with the
football.
Greg: dramatically broke the seal (a Mickey Mouse
balloon) on the iug which had served dutifully to
prevent the cider from oxidizing into vinegar. His
swollen eyes peered intensely into the murky depths
of quantity X.
Perceiving the stimulating aroma of quantity X, the
scientists desisted their seven-day game of catch
and scampered lightly up the three flights of stairs
to our laboratory (room 330 Encina).
Forcing his drooping lips into a triumphant smile,
Greg spoke out to the mob, "I know you all would
like to volunteer to test the effect of Fleisehmann's
Yeast upon Harvest Day apple cider, so will just the
unmarried men step forward?"
Jim Reid slunk to the fore and proceeded to chug
a-lug.
The mcb awaited judgment with bated breath.
"Tell us all about quantity X. What does it taste
like?" 4
Composing himself and choosing his words with
care, Hero Reid spoke unto the masses.
"Urina equi!"
Science.

Thoughts are hut steamboats
Like holts of yellow lightning,
ISiting, writhipg, smiiing,
Screaming, screaming, screaming,
But rising, Taller, Straighter, Greater.

There comes a time in the life of every young
first-year man when he must ferment apple eider in
his room. This is one of the primary phases in the
development of an undergraduate student, the "sine
qua non" of a college education.
One of the first first-year men to come into a
potent and virile manhood was my roommate, Greg
Danninger. His experiment, which he took quite

seriously, had careful "controls"
and was dutifully observed with
meticulous regularity.
Science has a romantic appeal
to first-year men. Our room was
filled day and night during the
week-long experiment with sci
entists from every nook and
cranny of picturesque Encina
Hall. Sleep and study were im
possibilities in the room as the
experiment drew into its final

Red-eyed from loss of sleep, Greg held seminars
every hour explaining the phenomenon of nature
to the throngs of scientists which milled restlessly
j'bcut our cubicle, awaiting the process of hydro
genation to reach completion.
"This is a controlled scientific experiment testing
the effect of pressure, temperature, and yeast upon
apple cider," Greg would explain. The scientists often
played cat.'h with the deflated football of my other
roommate as a nervous release, breaking clocks, light
bulbs, phonographs, mirrors (cursing them with seven
