## From Another Viewpoint 
### RAYNARD C. SWANK 
(Editor's note: The author of today's column is
the director of the University libraries. As what he
h; % written indicates, though many students are
net aware of the fact, he and his staff are making
a continual effort to improve the library's services.)
Every morning 'when members of the library staff
•pad the Daily, they half expect to find —and some
times do find—a caustic editorial or letter about the
library. Student reaction matters a great deal to
them, the more so because they themselves are keenly
aware of the weaknesses of the lfbrary program. In
deed, for every adverse criticism that students think
up the library staff could think up half a dozen. So
112 or another viewpoint, let us see what the staff thinks
about the library and how they would like to improve
it.
For one thing, the staff feels strongly that many
more books should be out on open shelves where
everybody could freely use them. The nature of the
library building now interposes a number ,of ad
ministrative and physical barriers which seem cal
culated to keep the bocks away from the students—
to protect the books instead of stimulating their use.
IV >-i of the books that anyone cares to read are
hidden in the stacks or secured behind an attendant's
desk. Given a few necessary changes in the building,
the staff would like nothing better than to bring out
into the reading rooms about 100,000 of the best books
ar.d to turn the students loose on them.
As soon as more open-shelf reading rooms are
available, the staff plans to set aside the biggest one
for freshmen and sophomores, who are now the
forgotten ones of the library program. The Uni
versity Library is primarily a research library—
large, complex, difficult to use. For the lower di
vision student, whose book needs are relatively
simple, it is hpth frustrating and superfluous. The
new lower division or general education library
would he designed to give these students a desir
i '• i" n«d appropriate first library experience in the
Universiiy, to instruct them in the l>;st use of the
library. and to spare them the research library (and
the research library them) until they had under
-1 ken advanced, specialized study. It wculd be
roughly equivalent to a liberal arts college library.
As part of the general education library, the staff
would like to display, in addition to curricular ma

terials, a large general collection of best books for
recreational reading. There is iittle about the library
now, except for the seven day shelves, that would
even suggest to a student that reading might be a
pleasure. Just try to drop in Casually and pick out
something interesting to read. Not even the staff can
do it. And where is the easy chair, the good light,
the informal atmosphere in which to settle down and
enjoy one's favorite author?
For advanced study the staff would like to convert
the main reading room into a humanities library in
which the frequently used books, journals, bibliog
raphies, and reference works in the humanistic dis
ciplines would all be assembled on open shelves. A
social science library, including maps and documents,
would occupy what is now the periodical room. The
present handling of art and drama books suggests the
possibilities.
There are a number of other things (hat the staff
would like to change. In conjunction with the open
shelf reading rooms they would like to provide con
ference, seminar, and typing rooms—noisy rooms,
if you please, where students and faculty could talk
as much as they wish. They would also like to pro
vide facilities for the convenient use of motion pic
ture films, slides, and phonograph records. They
would like to make of the library a laboratory for
the book-centered departments of the University.
Most of these improvements, unfortunately, must
await costly changes in the library building. The
building has served the University well, but it is by
now so outmoded that every effort of the staff to
modernize the library service is fraught with diffi
culties and frustrations. Even the lights, as everyone
knows, are inexcusably poor. Yet there is a plan for
every square inch of the building in the future, and
the building is quite capable of effective renovation.
What the staff really wants is to give the library
back to the students and faculty, to bring the books
into the closest possible conlact with the people who
i;ead them, and to create an atmosphere conducive to
reading. For most students the library is probably a
mere stockroom for assigned reading—whereas, in the
viewpoint of the staff, it should function as an edu
cational stimulant. Alter all, reading is still an in
dispensable element in the life of every educated man.
One tiling more: the library is everybody's business.

What the staff really wants is to give the library
back to the students and faculty, to bring the books
into the closest possible conlact with the people who
i;ead them, and to create an atmosphere conducive to
reading. For most students the library is probably a
mere stockroom for assigned reading—whereas, in the
viewpoint of the staff, it should function as an edu
cational stimulant. Alter all, reading is still an in
dispensable element in the life of every educated man.
One tiling more: the library is everybody's business.

(Editor's note: The author of today's column is
the director of the University libraries. As what he
h; % written indicates, though many students are
net aware of the fact, he and his staff are making
a continual effort to improve the library's services.)
Every morning 'when members of the library staff
•pad the Daily, they half expect to find —and some
times do find—a caustic editorial or letter about the
library. Student reaction matters a great deal to
them, the more so because they themselves are keenly
aware of the weaknesses of the lfbrary program. In
deed, for every adverse criticism that students think
up the library staff could think up half a dozen. So
112 or another viewpoint, let us see what the staff thinks
about the library and how they would like to improve
it.
For one thing, the staff feels strongly that many
more books should be out on open shelves where
everybody could freely use them. The nature of the
library building now interposes a number ,of ad
ministrative and physical barriers which seem cal
culated to keep the bocks away from the students—
to protect the books instead of stimulating their use.
IV >-i of the books that anyone cares to read are
hidden in the stacks or secured behind an attendant's
desk. Given a few necessary changes in the building,
the staff would like nothing better than to bring out
into the reading rooms about 100,000 of the best books
ar.d to turn the students loose on them.
As soon as more open-shelf reading rooms are
available, the staff plans to set aside the biggest one
for freshmen and sophomores, who are now the
forgotten ones of the library program. The Uni
versity Library is primarily a research library—
large, complex, difficult to use. For the lower di
vision student, whose book needs are relatively
simple, it is hpth frustrating and superfluous. The
new lower division or general education library
would he designed to give these students a desir
i '• i" n«d appropriate first library experience in the
Universiiy, to instruct them in the l>;st use of the
library. and to spare them the research library (and
the research library them) until they had under
-1 ken advanced, specialized study. It wculd be
roughly equivalent to a liberal arts college library.
As part of the general education library, the staff
would like to display, in addition to curricular ma

terials, a large general collection of best books for
recreational reading. There is iittle about the library
now, except for the seven day shelves, that would
even suggest to a student that reading might be a
pleasure. Just try to drop in Casually and pick out
something interesting to read. Not even the staff can
do it. And where is the easy chair, the good light,
the informal atmosphere in which to settle down and
enjoy one's favorite author?
For advanced study the staff would like to convert
the main reading room into a humanities library in
which the frequently used books, journals, bibliog
raphies, and reference works in the humanistic dis
ciplines would all be assembled on open shelves. A
social science library, including maps and documents,
would occupy what is now the periodical room. The
present handling of art and drama books suggests the
possibilities.
There are a number of other things (hat the staff
would like to change. In conjunction with the open
shelf reading rooms they would like to provide con
ference, seminar, and typing rooms—noisy rooms,
if you please, where students and faculty could talk
as much as they wish. They would also like to pro
vide facilities for the convenient use of motion pic
ture films, slides, and phonograph records. They
would like to make of the library a laboratory for
the book-centered departments of the University.
Most of these improvements, unfortunately, must
await costly changes in the library building. The
building has served the University well, but it is by
now so outmoded that every effort of the staff to
modernize the library service is fraught with diffi
culties and frustrations. Even the lights, as everyone
knows, are inexcusably poor. Yet there is a plan for

shelf reading rooms they would like to provide con
ference, seminar, and typing rooms—noisy rooms,
if you please, where students and faculty could talk
as much as they wish. They would also like to pro
vide facilities for the convenient use of motion pic
ture films, slides, and phonograph records. They
would like to make of the library a laboratory for
the book-centered departments of the University.
Most of these improvements, unfortunately, must
await costly changes in the library building. The
building has served the University well, but it is by
now so outmoded that every effort of the staff to
modernize the library service is fraught with diffi
culties and frustrations. Even the lights, as everyone
knows, are inexcusably poor. Yet there is a plan for
every square inch of the building in the future, and
the building is quite capable of effective renovation.
What the staff really wants is to give the library
back to the students and faculty, to bring the books
into the closest possible conlact with the people who
i;ead them, and to create an atmosphere conducive to
reading. For most students the library is probably a
mere stockroom for assigned reading—whereas, in the
viewpoint of the staff, it should function as an edu
cational stimulant. Alter all, reading is still an in
dispensable element in the life of every educated man.
One tiling more: the library is everybody's business.

(Editor's note: The author of today's column is
the director of the University libraries. As what he
h; % written indicates, though many students are
net aware of the fact, he and his staff are making
a continual effort to improve the library's services.)
Every morning 'when members of the library staff
•pad the Daily, they half expect to find —and some
times do find—a caustic editorial or letter about the
library. Student reaction matters a great deal to
them, the more so because they themselves are keenly
aware of the weaknesses of the lfbrary program. In
deed, for every adverse criticism that students think
up the library staff could think up half a dozen. So
112 or another viewpoint, let us see what the staff thinks
about the library and how they would like to improve
it.
For one thing, the staff feels strongly that many
more books should be out on open shelves where
everybody could freely use them. The nature of the
library building now interposes a number ,of ad
ministrative and physical barriers which seem cal
culated to keep the bocks away from the students—
to protect the books instead of stimulating their use.
IV >-i of the books that anyone cares to read are
hidden in the stacks or secured behind an attendant's
desk. Given a few necessary changes in the building,
the staff would like nothing better than to bring out
into the reading rooms about 100,000 of the best books
ar.d to turn the students loose on them.
As soon as more open-shelf reading rooms are
available, the staff plans to set aside the biggest one
for freshmen and sophomores, who are now the
forgotten ones of the library program. The Uni
versity Library is primarily a research library—
large, complex, difficult to use. For the lower di
vision student, whose book needs are relatively
simple, it is hpth frustrating and superfluous. The
new lower division or general education library
would he designed to give these students a desir
i '• i" n«d appropriate first library experience in the
Universiiy, to instruct them in the l>;st use of the
library. and to spare them the research library (and
the research library them) until they had under
-1 ken advanced, specialized study. It wculd be
roughly equivalent to a liberal arts college library.
As part of the general education library, the staff
would like to display, in addition to curricular ma

terials, a large general collection of best books for
recreational reading. There is iittle about the library
now, except for the seven day shelves, that would
even suggest to a student that reading might be a
pleasure. Just try to drop in Casually and pick out
something interesting to read. Not even the staff can
do it. And where is the easy chair, the good light,
the informal atmosphere in which to settle down and
enjoy one's favorite author?
For advanced study the staff would like to convert
the main reading room into a humanities library in
which the frequently used books, journals, bibliog
raphies, and reference works in the humanistic dis
ciplines would all be assembled on open shelves. A
social science library, including maps and documents,
would occupy what is now the periodical room. The
present handling of art and drama books suggests the
possibilities.
