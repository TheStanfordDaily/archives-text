# IIR Asks Farm Faculty To Send Books to Berlin
## 
### 
The lIR Berlin Affiliation Committee is undertaking a token of
friendship project this year to further relations with the Free Uni
versity of West Berlin. The Committee is asking all those Stanford
faculty members who have written books to donate a copy and
autograph it to the Free University.
The Free University, founded in 1948 by German students who
objected to the totalitarian controls â™¦

enforced by the Russians in the old
University of Berlin, officially ce
irfented an affiliation with Stanford
in the spring of this year. The 11H
Berlin Affiliation Committee has
taken up the task of making this

affiliation more than, just words.
From letters and first-hand infor
mation, it is apparent that the Ger
man students still need books and
clothes. But even more important is
the need for letting them know that
the students at Stanford are genu
inely interested in them and in their
university.
The faculty-written books will be
sent to Germany as a gift of friend
ship from the faculty and students
of Stanford to the faculty and stu
dents at the Free University of Ber-
