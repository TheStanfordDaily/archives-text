# Daily Wonder Team Prepares For Titanic Struggle With Californian
## 
### 
While 83.000 eager Big Game fans
are still in bed, sleeping off their
pre-game activities, a great moment
in Stanford sports will be developed
amid the sleeping foothills of Ber
keley.
There, at 9 a.m. in Memorial' St
adium. the terrible titans of the type
writers will mass for the first Bitty
Big Game in collegiate history—a
battle between unbeaten power
houses—the Stanford Daily and the
Daily Cal. This game may decide
the fate of modern sportswriting.
The game is expected to be a
heated affair, as neither team has
particular love for the other. Pre
game disputes have already arisen
over the size, shape, and content
of the football. Cal insists upon
the conventional ball, while the
"Cards" claim that a ball approxi
mately six feet long, three feet
aero s, and filled with beer is the
only ball filling the needs of the
Dippymaniacs.
Meanwhile, the forces of good

liess and light, led by "Coach"
Larry Calm, star tailback and
sports editor, have been running
through scrimmages and getting
in shape for the big crucial.
As the teams line up now, Larry
(Pro) Cahn starts at quarterback.
Jim Madison, whose chief claim to
athletic fame is that he roomed with
pitcher Joe Chez once, goes at right
half. Plunging Pete Grothe, 175-
pound All-Publications fullback last
year, starts at full. Bouncing Ben
Harris will knock Bears down from
his left halfback post.
Don (Steam - engine) Stephens
goes at right end, and 190-pound
Rampaging Russ Wilks opens at left
end, while 250-pound Phil Berman
will play center and both guards.
Tricky Dick Maltzman. Tangle
foot Mike Hudson, Wes Marx, A 1
Mazour, Lou Pujalet, and Bill Mc-
Coll spearhead the defense.


BIG DAILY MACHINE—Here's the formidable eleven that will
face the Daily Californian at Berkeley Saturday morning. The
"Seven Mules" that make up the line are Russ Wilks (31), Mike
Hudson (52), Dick Maltzman (39), Phil Berman (37), A 1 Mazour
(50), Don Stephens (58), and Wes Marx (55). The Horse
men" backfield consists of Jim Madison (38), Larry Cahn (51),

While 83.000 eager Big Game fans
are still in bed, sleeping off their
pre-game activities, a great moment
in Stanford sports will be developed
amid the sleeping foothills of Ber
keley.
There, at 9 a.m. in Memorial' St
adium. the terrible titans of the type
writers will mass for the first Bitty
Big Game in collegiate history—a
battle between unbeaten power
houses—the Stanford Daily and the
Daily Cal. This game may decide
the fate of modern sportswriting.
The game is expected to be a
heated affair, as neither team has
particular love for the other. Pre
game disputes have already arisen
over the size, shape, and content
of the football. Cal insists upon
the conventional ball, while the
"Cards" claim that a ball approxi
mately six feet long, three feet
aero s, and filled with beer is the
only ball filling the needs of the
Dippymaniacs.
Meanwhile, the forces of good

liess and light, led by "Coach"
Larry Calm, star tailback and
sports editor, have been running
through scrimmages and getting
in shape for the big crucial.
As the teams line up now, Larry
(Pro) Cahn starts at quarterback.
Jim Madison, whose chief claim to
athletic fame is that he roomed with
pitcher Joe Chez once, goes at right
half. Plunging Pete Grothe, 175-
pound All-Publications fullback last
year, starts at full. Bouncing Ben
Harris will knock Bears down from
his left halfback post.
Don (Steam - engine) Stephens
goes at right end, and 190-pound
Rampaging Russ Wilks opens at left
end, while 250-pound Phil Berman
will play center and both guards.
Tricky Dick Maltzman. Tangle
foot Mike Hudson, Wes Marx, A 1
Mazour, Lou Pujalet, and Bill Mc-
Coll spearhead the defense.


BIG DAILY MACHINE—Here's the formidable eleven that will
face the Daily Californian at Berkeley Saturday morning. The
"Seven Mules" that make up the line are Russ Wilks (31), Mike
Hudson (52), Dick Maltzman (39), Phil Berman (37), A 1 Mazour
(50), Don Stephens (58), and Wes Marx (55). The Horse
