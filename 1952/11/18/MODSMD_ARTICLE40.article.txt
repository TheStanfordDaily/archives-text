# PUNTS AND PITCHES
## No Waiting Till Next Year 
### PETE GROTHE 
Here I sit in the Daily Shack.
Across the room a frosh woman reporter is trvini/ to write a headline.
She hits been working on it for 45 minutes. Mike Hudson, the joker of
the sports stall', and staff editor Ruby Bernstein are having a fly-swatting
contest. The night editor, head copy editor, and reporters are busying
around putting out tomorrow's Daily.
Here I sit. And I am trying to figure how we are going to beat Cal
this Saturday.
When I was a freshman Cal had the Axe. I am now a senior and Cal
still has the Axe. As a matter of fact, men in their second year of grad
school have never seen the Axe's glistening blade. Ever since I have been

a freshman, people have been saying, "Just
wait until next year." For us in the Class
of '53, there is no "next year." The time is
now. Next year won't do. As they say in the
Class B movies, This is IT.
And so here I sit. trying to figure out how
we are going to beat Cal.
I am trying to figure out how a line that
couldn't consistently open holes against a
second division club like Oregon can move the
Bear forwards. And how our sieve-like pass
defense is going to hold up. And how our
line is going to stop the terrific Cal running
trio of Olszewski, Johnson, and Powell. And
how a kid who played third string halfback

as a freshman is going to quarterback a team to victory. And how our
half-dozen injured players are going to fare under the physical beating.
And then as I struggle over these problems, a saying comes to me. It's
the most overworked, beaten-up cliche in existence, and yet its truth
stands undiminished: "In the Big Game, past records mean nothing."
In other words, forget that Cal is a two touchdown favorite, that scout
Joe Ruetz considers the Cal of last week the powerful Cal of old. Wipe
off the slate the SC game, the UCLA, and Washington defeats.
When it comes to the Big Game, past records are of nought. Mind
triumphs over matter. Look at the '48 game. Stanford hadn't won a game
all year. Cal hadn't lost. The bookies were giving 10 to 1 odds, and what
happened? Stanford led, 18 to 14 with three minutes remaining, and only
a fluke play gave the Bears victory. Look at the '50 tussle. Pappy Waldorf's
squad had already sewed up the Rose Bowl invitation while Stanford had
plodded through a mediocre year. The Bears were heavy favorites, and
what happened? The game ended, 7 to 7 with Stanford having one touch
down called back.
In short, when things look blackost in the Big Game, that's when Stan
ford usually does its best. When the Indians are favored, that's when they
blow. Witness last year.
And then when I start looking at the asset side of the ledger, I just
can't suppress that ray of hope that insists on popping up. I can't help
but think that Bob Mathias, the world's most perfect athlete, can break
up a ball game at any given moment. That a husky, confident quarterback
who steps into the starting role and breaks a Stanford record for passing
yardage (321) in his first game may well pass Cal to death. That the addi
tion of Dave Eldridge to the defensive backfield may jack it up enough to
hold off Cal's mediocre air game. That guys like Kirkland, Essegian,
Tanner, Wedge, and Armitage, could hold the Cal ground attack to a
minimum. That strong blockers like Vick, Goldberg. Mayrhofer, and
Wilson may open holes in the Richter-less Cal line. And that deft
receivers like Morlev, Steinberg, Mathias, and Cook will run circles around
the weak Berkeley pass defense.
On the other side of the room, the frosh reporter is still working on the
headline. Hudson has killed four flys and Bernstein three. Editors and
reporters are still flitting about.
And so here I sit in the Daily Shack. And I am predicting a Stanford
victory. We're going to win this one. dammit.

contest. The night editor, head copy editor, and reporters are busying
around putting out tomorrow's Daily.
Here I sit. And I am trying to figure how we are going to beat Cal
this Saturday.
When I was a freshman Cal had the Axe. I am now a senior and Cal
still has the Axe. As a matter of fact, men in their second year of grad
school have never seen the Axe's glistening blade. Ever since I have been

a freshman, people have been saying, "Just
wait until next year." For us in the Class
of '53, there is no "next year." The time is
now. Next year won't do. As they say in the
Class B movies, This is IT.
And so here I sit. trying to figure out how
we are going to beat Cal.
I am trying to figure out how a line that
couldn't consistently open holes against a
second division club like Oregon can move the
Bear forwards. And how our sieve-like pass
defense is going to hold up. And how our
line is going to stop the terrific Cal running
trio of Olszewski, Johnson, and Powell. And
how a kid who played third string halfback

as a freshman is going to quarterback a team to victory. And how our
half-dozen injured players are going to fare under the physical beating.
And then as I struggle over these problems, a saying comes to me. It's
the most overworked, beaten-up cliche in existence, and yet its truth
stands undiminished: "In the Big Game, past records mean nothing."
In other words, forget that Cal is a two touchdown favorite, that scout
Joe Ruetz considers the Cal of last week the powerful Cal of old. Wipe
off the slate the SC game, the UCLA, and Washington defeats.
When it comes to the Big Game, past records are of nought. Mind
triumphs over matter. Look at the '48 game. Stanford hadn't won a game
all year. Cal hadn't lost. The bookies were giving 10 to 1 odds, and what
happened? Stanford led, 18 to 14 with three minutes remaining, and only
a fluke play gave the Bears victory. Look at the '50 tussle. Pappy Waldorf's
squad had already sewed up the Rose Bowl invitation while Stanford had
plodded through a mediocre year. The Bears were heavy favorites, and
what happened? The game ended, 7 to 7 with Stanford having one touch
down called back.
In short, when things look blackost in the Big Game, that's when Stan
ford usually does its best. When the Indians are favored, that's when they
blow. Witness last year.
And then when I start looking at the asset side of the ledger, I just
can't suppress that ray of hope that insists on popping up. I can't help
but think that Bob Mathias, the world's most perfect athlete, can break
up a ball game at any given moment. That a husky, confident quarterback
who steps into the starting role and breaks a Stanford record for passing
yardage (321) in his first game may well pass Cal to death. That the addi
tion of Dave Eldridge to the defensive backfield may jack it up enough to
hold off Cal's mediocre air game. That guys like Kirkland, Essegian,
Tanner, Wedge, and Armitage, could hold the Cal ground attack to a
minimum. That strong blockers like Vick, Goldberg. Mayrhofer, and
Wilson may open holes in the Richter-less Cal line. And that deft
receivers like Morlev, Steinberg, Mathias, and Cook will run circles around
the weak Berkeley pass defense.
On the other side of the room, the frosh reporter is still working on the
headline. Hudson has killed four flys and Bernstein three. Editors and
reporters are still flitting about.
And so here I sit in the Daily Shack. And I am predicting a Stanford
victory. We're going to win this one. dammit.

Here I sit in the Daily Shack.
