# Skipper, Len Questionable For Big One
## 
### 
Chuck Taylor was gloomy yestftr- I
day morning.
Skip Crist with a concussion amf j
Len Muyrhofer with a leg injury
had been declared definitely out ol
Saturday's Big Game. By afternoon
Chuck was smiling a wee bit. Skip
and Len are now on the doubtful
list.
Skip is running through plays and
a decision as to whether he will
play or not will be made later in the
week. Mayrhofer has a lifty-fifty
chance.
But with the exception of Bob ;
Garrett all others will be in good ;
health. That means Hon Cook, j
Chuck Essegian, Whitey Pyle, A 1 i
Kirkland, and John Ludeke will be j
ready for service.
For the first time since Taylor j
came to Stanford two years ago, 1
the Indian mentor was down in the I
dumps. "I know, and nobody's go
ing to kid me into thinking other- !
wise, we have to go way over our
heads to stay on even terms with
California," Chuck asserted.
But reflecting his usual optimistic
viewpoint, Chuck added, "There
comes a time in every football j
team's life when the kids do amaz
ing things."
And in practice yesterday after
noon the Cards looked determined i
to do amazing things as they ran |
through plays. Following practice,
Cal game movies were .shown and
the scouting reports on the Bears |
were read.
