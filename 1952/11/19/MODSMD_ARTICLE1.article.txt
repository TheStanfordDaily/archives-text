## Future Plans Are Revealed By Stevenson 
### 
SPRINGFIELD, HI.. Nov. 18 (UP)
— Adlai E. Stevenson returned to his
Governor's desk today with a dec
laration that he would like to speak
out on "important issues" and help
bolster "weak spots" in the Demo
cratic party during the next four
years.
Looking tanned and fit after a '
brief Arizona vacation, the defeated
Democratic Presidential nominee
also revealed that lie expects to re
turn to his Chicago law practice
after his term as Governor expires.
"I would like a hand in straight
ening out weak spots in the Demo
cratic party," the Illinois Governor
said when asked what his role
would be in refurbishing the party ;
for the 1954 and 195G elections.
Ho also said that "I would like the j
privilege of expressing myself from
time to time on important issues."
Stevenson did not say how he
would express liis views, but his of- ;
fico here has been flooded with let- j
ters from persons who have offered J
contributions to pay for radio and j
television time for Stevenson to j
speak out. In Los Angeles a com- i
mittee of citizens has been formed j
for the same purpose.
President Truman recently sent
Stevenson a message saying he
hoped the Governor would continue
to work "as leader of our party."
