Anticipating the result of this
Saturday's game, Ram's Head
came up with a winner in its
1952 edition of Big Game Gaie
ties. The show, played before
a small audience last night, is
scheduled to run until Friday
night.
Well-stocked with the customary
fillers and corny gag.s (with stand
ards in this department being set
by Ram's Head's erstwhile business
managers, Milt. Cohen and Roc Har

a fine and spirited evening of mer
riment. Except for a couple of num
bers, most of the skits are of high
caliber, both in contcnt and per
formance. '
"Greatest Whirl in the World"
and "Devil in the Dance" were
both fine .song and dance num
bers. executed with a maximum of
grace and poise by the entire cast.
There arc, however, a few rough
spots in the choral work that ran
easily be cleared up after some
first-night jitlccs are dispensed
with.
"Crossing the Channel" proved to
be a very funny satire, and was
really well played by Virginia
Royce and her numerous male com

Suzie Marion turned in what
was probably the most outstand
ing single performance of the
show in "Where radicular Peo
ple Congregate." a three - sided
view of Kossotti's.
Two chorus line numbers, how
ever, proved to bo show-stoppers.
"Ricky Tick," featuring a line of
Gibson Girls, and the boys from
Encina in "There's No Place Like"
were both done with the proper
chorus-line dash of old troopers.
All of the sets are good, espe
cially for the finale, "It's in the
Cards."
