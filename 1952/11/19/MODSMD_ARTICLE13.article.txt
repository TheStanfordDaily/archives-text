# Appeal Issued For Bonfire Volunteers
## 
### 
The frosli bonfire was still less
than 10 feet high yesterday after
noon, as a shortage of labor slowed
progress.
Few more than 80 of the 800 frosh
men had showed up to build Oskic's
pyre as of yesterday afternoon.
Work began Saturday.
The Bonfire Committee empha
sizes that the structure cannot be
raised to its goal unless freshmen
work continuously.
Although a fairly large team of
workers reported Monday night, at
3 p.m. yesterday only one freshman
was at work on the structure —
scheduled to soar over 85 feet be
fore tomorrow night's rally.
Conditions this year have been
better than the rainy weather faced
by last year's builders. Clear weath
er is predicted for today and tomor
row. The Class of '55 raised its rec
ord 85-foot structure on a partially
water-filled, muddy lake bed, pour
ing hundreds of gallons of oil onto
the wet wood to make it burn.

OSKIE'S PYRE—With the Big Game Bonfire structure only 10
feet high yesterday, bottom photo, an appeal was issued for
freshmen to work on the pyre in order to reach the 85-foot goal
before tomorrow night's rally. The top photo shows last year's
bonfire at this time, which was constructed by the class of '55
despite a week-long rain and a partially-flooded lake bed.
