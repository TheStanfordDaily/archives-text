which he had copied the night he
fore from an old theme he had
found in his roommate's desk.

mentioned to the student that, al
though having no evidence, he
! suspected the originality of (lie
theme.
The student first admitted taking
only ideas of another theme, hut
later, when asked hy the instructor,
! submitted the original and confessed
| copying most of it verbatim.
Although in past cases the Coun
cil has recommended stricter penal
ties for such violations, leniency was
granted in consideration of the 'in
dent's first admission of guilt by
which he knowinglv and voluntarily

plete relief from the sentence.
