# Your Chance Today
## 
### 
Well, today we try again.
Last Friday an unprecedented vote gobbled
up the supply of ballots long before the election
Was over. So today there'll be a complete re
vote on all officers except Frosh Representative
to Excom—as well as the Liquor Resolution.
We ask you to vote today. Any vote you cast
Friday has been declared null and void. In
order to have your choice in how your student
government is run, you must vote again today.
And even though y£>u may not be voting for an
Excom representative, your Men's or Women's
Council members have yet to be chosen.
Then, too, each and every one of you is
eligible to vote on the Liquor Resolution.
From freshman to graduate, you have this
chance to decide whether or not the Stanford
student body will back this measure.
The Daily has asked you to vote ' Yes" on

the resolution. We have cited the current de
plorable, hypocritical liquor situation. We be
lieve that the resolution would be an excellent
way to start action which would eventually
alleviate this situation.
Specifically, we favor the resolution as it
stands, because we feel the 18-year-old should
be free to decide for himself whether or%iot he
wants to drink. Abuses of this privilege would
be controlled by his parents or by law as are
abuses of other privileges.
We believe, too, that Stanford should not
he ashamed of attaching its name to the res
olution. There should be no shame in having
the courage of one's convictions- be they
collective or otherwise.
This, then, is why we ask you to vote "Yen"
the Liquor Resolution. But whether
your vote is "Yes" ov "No" —VOTE!
