# What's to Be Done?
## 
### 
It's timesaving to go down to the Cellar to
buy your magazines and papers. It's a real con
venience. «
However, some students are taking advan
tage of this convenience. They're not buying
papers. To put it frankly, they're swiping them.
Perhaps these people lorget that the Cellar
magazine rack is a business proposition. A
survey taken recently throughout the coun
try shows that magazine and newspaper deal
ers annually suiter a six per cent loss tioni
periodicals and papers that are stolen. At
Stanford, however, Miss Christine, Bicker,
director of the Stanford Union, reports that
the Cellar rack shews a 10 to 12 per cent loss.
What's to be done? We believe that 10 per
cent of the magazines just don't walk away by
themselves. Some people, accoiding to Miss
Ricker, do accidentally walk away with news
papers. They, however, return to pay for them.
But there is another group which just "forgets"

to see the cashier on their way out of the Cellar.
Sure, the Cellar could board up their maga
zines. They could make you ask tor the mag
azine you desire. This, however, would take !
away all the pleasure ot browsing which most ;
people like to do before purchasing a maga
zine.
At the Encina store, for instance, the maga
zines are kept behind the counter. Only a
limited number of magazines are kept there,
too.
But at the Cellar students have complete
freedom. The magazines are there for your con
venience. A supply of some 75 magazines are
regularly stocked magazines for pleasure
reading, for research material, and for other
class projects.
This is indeed another violation of the Funda
mental Standard. We suggest the people who
are in error think it over.
