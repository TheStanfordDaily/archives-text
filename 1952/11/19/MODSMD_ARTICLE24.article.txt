# Why Don't More Professors?
## 
### 
Sunday evening we were invited, along with
a group of other students, to coffee, dessert,
and conversation at a professor's home. As we
weie leaving, one of the students commented,
"Why don't more professors do this?"
We wonder, too. Perhaps if professors real
ized how much their interest and hospitality
is appreciated, more of them would be willing
to open their homes to their students.
Many efforts have been made to bridge the
gap which so plainly exists between students
and faculty at Stanford: faculty guests at stu
dent living groups, joint committees, even stu
dent-faculty baseball games.
But we have seen no contact half as effective

as that in the sympathetic atmosphere of the
professor's home.
We are told that Stanford students have an
inordinate fear of appearing to apple polish.
Perhaps this is why they are so grateful when
the professor makes the first move toward get
ting acquainted.
We are well aware that hospitality is a lot to
ask; entertaining students could be a real bur
den for a busy professor who has set up house
keeping on a fairly meager salary.
But if any professors are looking for some
thing worthwhile to do, let them feel assured
thu! any invitations they extend will be deeply
appreciated and greatly enjoyed.
