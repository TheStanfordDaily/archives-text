# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
WEDNESDAY MORNING WASH
Chaplain Minto right now is wondering why the
Chaplain's house was ever placed next to Lathrop.
Several days ago, a Farm coed with long blond
hair whipped into Minto's home, went through every
drawer in the house looking for another girl's test
paper, was informed, "No, this isn't Lathrop."

A few weeks ago, Dr. Minto
was relaxing in his easy chair,
smoking his pipe and reading the
evening paper. Whereupon an
enthusiastic Rally Com-er flung
the door open und shouted, "All
out for the Rally!"
At the beginning of the quarter,
a student rushed in and queried
Minto, "Okay, where's the kit
chen?"
"Just why do you want the
kitchen 0 "

"I hash here," was the impatient reply.
"I rather wish you did," said Stanford's man of the
cloth, "but Lathrop is next dcor."
"Oh my God" was the student's only comment.
This was appropriate for the Chaplain.

ANOTIFR VIEWPOINT. The Rev. Daniel Jenk
ins from London, upon being questioned how he
enjoyed the Stanford-USC game, said dryly, "Foot
ball is the most interesting form of mechanized war
fare J have ever seen."
Ron Hall, a transfer from Oxford University sitting
in the middle of the Stanford rooting section, re
marked, "Rather partisan, aren't they?"

GREAT, GREAT, GREAT. What? This year's Big
Game Gaieties, even though George Denny's gone.
Hal Burdick's tremendous, Jane Bowen stands out in
dancing, Enb James is at his singing best, and Steve
Stevens' elcctric equipment (made by taking a pin
ball mochine apart) for the "Kiddies' Matinee" .skit
is the most complicated setup tnis side of Oak Ridge.

WARNING. Unless the Class of '56 puts more time
into the bonfire pyre, it will be the smallest in six
years. Oskie's toes won't even be warmed.
DISCREPANCY. Forty biz school students walked
into their 9 a.m. accounting class. At 9:30 a.m., their
professor said, "I am dismissing class right now. No
one in the class knows the answers. In the five years
I've been teaching at Stanford, this is the worst dis
play 1 have seen."
The very same 40 biz schoolers went to their 10 a.m.
business organization class. The professor greeted
them with this statement: "In the five years I've been
teaching ;.t Stanford, I've never hud the pleasure of
reading such fine reports."

We end <his column on a serious note. A janitor
from (In- biology department came in the Daily
Shark yesterdav. He told ine that a graduate stu
dent made fun of him, inferred that he wasn't
capable of anything but janitorial duties. The jani
tor, who had saved every penny he owned to im
migrate from Austria to America, handed me the
following poem; 1 print it gladly:
To a young man al Stanford University
My hands are The mop
Enslaved While I am working
lUit my mind Is a means
Is free To cat
I travel While the broom
Through space I am pushing
Over land IMakes tired
Over sea My feet
Where beauty But I do
Fv h'dden Dream of
Yet I Hoses
Can see Where thistles
'1 lie goodness You see
Of nature Yes ...
The weakness My hands
Of man Ar« enslaved
And so But my mind
I am contented Is
I ain Still
Who I am Fret
