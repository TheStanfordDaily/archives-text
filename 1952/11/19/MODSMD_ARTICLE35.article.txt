## Where's That Silver Lining? 
### 
This morning we search the Fall sky for a silver lining.
Saturday the Indians invade Berkeley to do battle with a Bear who j
again has sharp claws. And we are not going to pull our punches, that I
•sky Is mighty, mighty dark, and the silver linings are far between.
We have seen California play twice. We don't see how an Indian
defensive unit can stop their explosive thrusts. We have seen their line
stop teams cold. They should not have much trouble concentrating on
Mr. Mathias considering lie to date is the only back to prove himself
dangerous. We received a letter which said in part: "Some back will
have a great chance to go aT Berkeley, because after last Saturday's
performance, California will really concentrate on "Stop Mathias and
you stop the Stanford Offense."
Skip Crist and, or Ron Cook might be surprises, hut at this writing |
Cook is back with a bad knee and Crist might ni;t play. In other words :
Mathias may have to carry the entire load again. If so, it won't be too ;

On the other hand the Bears have such runners as Olszewski, Powell, !
Johnson, Larson and even Quarterback Wilisey is quite the stepper and '
likes to do it.
But wait, we see a speck of light. The Bears don't pass much and
this is fortunate because the Cards don't have a pass defense or if they
do they have done a good job of hiding it. And on the same note, the j
Bears also lack a pass defense of excellent quality and the Cards do i
pass well. This coidd be good. But don't count on it unless the Card
forward wall gives a little protection to Mr. Gebert.
The coaches of both schools have been fighting for the underdog role j
iill week. Stanford has earned it on ability. But Pappy insists that hisi
.squad should not be favored. We can't see his point. Besides last year!
we listened to his crying and his Bears, who were the underdogs, rose
to outstanding heights to sit Stanford right on the backs of their red i
punts. The underdog position is desired for psychological purposes.
And this is a big patch of light, this business of being underdog. If
the Indians can get otr the backs of their laps and rise to their potential, j
they can knock ott the Bears. Now we said "IF." It's going to take a lot
of doing but Stanford does have the guns to score. Whether it has the
stuff to stop the Bears is questionable. And even more questionable is
whether Stanford is going to have the will to win. the spirit. They didn't
last year.
But practices this week have been spirited and that memory of last
year's Hop should be enough to prevent repitition.
And perhaps the biggest and only definite silver lining is that this is
the Big Game, It's the game where the unusual is expected and where
surprises are common place. Odds can almost be tossed out.
Who do we think will win? On paper and judging by ability and past
records it looks like California. But we are looking for something called
that Stanford Spirit to rise to untold heights—heights it hasn't reached
since the USC game last year, and though our common sense tells us
not to, but because we always lean towards the Red and awjfy from the !
Blue, we are sticking our nicked neck out once again and going along
with the Cards and the Stanford Spirit.

I,ast week after writing that USC played clean ball, movies proved
us wrong. Skip Crist was apparently deliberately slugged by an SC
rough boy when Skipper was entirely out of the play and had no reason
to guard him.self. It is very similar to the Johnny Bright incident at
Drake University last year and we don't think the incident is closed.
If Skip misses his last Big (lame the lilame can he placed on unnecessary
tactics by USC.
