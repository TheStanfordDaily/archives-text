# Booters Drop Broncos; Prep for Big, Bad Bears
## 
### 
Coach Leo Weinstein has declared
"Run the Pants Off Cal" Week out
on the soccer practice field, as the
soccermen prep for a return match
with the Bears this weekend at
Berkeley.
Having downed Santa Clara last
weekend 5 to 0 to keep their sec
ond-round position of being knotted
with USF for first place, the Cards
will be favorites to dump the Bears
on Saturday.
Against Santa Clara, Weinstein
cleared his bench of every player in
an effort to hold down the score, and
the subs—who form the JV team —
came through fine. Right inside
Fred Tuerk was particularly out
standing as he scored a pair of goals.
Weinstein says that his men are
in their best all - around physical
condition of the season. Since Wein
stein also has no injuries to moan
about, the soccer football Cards

could well put on a better show j
Saturday than their American style j
counterparts, as they try to maintain
hopes to play off with USF for a |
t position in the national champion-
ship game. I
