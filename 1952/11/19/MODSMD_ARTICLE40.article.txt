# THE
						BIG GAME STORY
## Docs to Decide on Mayrhofer Still Doubtful 
### 
The Indians went through a spir
ited workout yesterday as the days
slide away before the oncoming Big
Game and the onrushing Bears.
Skip Crist and Len Mayrhofer are
j still doubtful. Crist sees a neurolo-
J gist today and a decision as to
j whether he will be available should
| come late this afternoon. Mayrhofer
stands a better than fifty - fifty
! chance of playing. The rest ol tlu
| squad is in good health.
The varsity went through a 30-
j minute passing drill with Jack Geb
i ert hitt.ing his receivers sharply.
1 Sam Morley, John Steinberg, and
Don Carlson looked shaip on the
receiving end along with backs Bob
; Mathias, Charlie Brazel, and Ron
Cook.
The offense ran running plays
j against dummy bags while frosh
! ran California plays against Stan
ford defensive units.
The Braves have been given the
week of! from working with the
varsity in order to practice for their

own game with the Cal Rambler
Saturday.
