## Biggest SRI Study: Smog 
### TED GIESE 
"Wo arc not at all sure that we
shall ever be able to find a solution
to the Los Angeles smog problem.
I believe that we can only alleviate
it and improve the situation."
This comment was delivered last
night by Jesse E. Hobs on, director
of the Stanford Research Instittute,
in a Tuesday Evening Series lecture
entitled "Stanford Research Insti
tute and Industry â€” Partners in
Progress."
It prefaced a color movie which
outlined the Los Angeles air-pol
lution problem and the results of
the city's thousand - foot - thick
"warm air inversion layer" which
traps polhitive gases and smoke
from factories, automobiles, and
private incinerators inside the
valley.
SRI has worked five years 011 this
problem, under a million - dollar
contract to the Wesfern Oil and Gas
Association. It. is the most extensive
study ever attempted on smog.
"It has been our most difficult, yet
most interesting single problem,"
remarked Dr. Hobson.
Tracing the* growth of SRI,
whose staff has since 1917 ex
panded from 41 to a present 548,
I)r. Hobson noted that at present
there are representatives spon
sored bv industry and govern
mental agencies doing research in
economics, chemistry, gcolo,Ty,
applied biology, and engineering
throughout the Western Hemis
phere and Marshall Plan Europe.
SRI has branch offices in Los
Angeles v Pasadena, Portland, and
Provo, Utah; and in addition oper
ates mobile units in Minnesota,
Texas, Utah, and Nevada for geo
physical and explosion - effect re
search.
