I'M TELLING YOU, THEY'RE THAT
THICK DOWN AT KIRK S
by WALTER "CHRYSLER" CARR
The Pilgrim Fathers at Plymouth in 1621 get credit
for the first Thanksgiving, and in 1759 President George
Washington designated such a day after the adoption of
the Constitution.
And we are thankful to Walter P. Chrysler fr>r the fir'.t
Plymouth automobile, built in the '20's.
We, the firm of Walter "Chrysler" Carr at Homer and
High aie having a "special" Thanksgiving Day Thurs
day, November 20th, the day of the showing of the 1953
Plymouth, with its control tower visibility, its balanced
weight distribution, its riding comfort, and driving ease,
with real adventure in luxurious styling. We certainly
have something to be thankful for before the National
Thanksgiving Day—the showing of the new Plymouth.
Also, we are thankful for the fine reception you are
giving the new 1953 Chrysler. Our soles have exceeded
our expectations.'
NEWS ITEM:
Joan Fontaine married Collier Young recently at iho
Villa Montalvo, Saratoga, and tastefully had the interior
