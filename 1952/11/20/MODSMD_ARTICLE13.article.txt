### MARY MASSEY Daily Associate Editor 
Stanford students may travel
to Europe next summer on an
ASSU sponsored tour, as a re
sult of Excom's precedent-break
ing action last night.
Excom voted approval after hear
ing Patti Brooks, representing the
lIR Overseas Information Service,
who explained the working of the
Cal student tours which are spon
sored by the ASUC.
Miss Brooks explained that the
ail-Stanford tour will cost $1,195
from San Francisco to Europe and
back in 74 days. Harry Anderson,
leader of the Cal tours, will arrange
the first tour. Excom approved the
plan in principle to await actual ar
rangements with Anderson.
Excom also worked toward facil
itating studying in both the Main
Library and History corner.
Following a suggestion by Ray
nard Swank, director of the Uni
versity Libraries, Excom created
a committee to meet monthly
with library officials to work out
lighting and other problems.
The committee will be composed
of a member from each class excom,
including the graduate excom, plus
a student who is working in the li
brary, to be appointed by the li
brary officials.
A 1 Hilton reported to Excom on
his survey of students studying in
History corner at night. Since a
need for such studying was shown,
appropriate rooms in the History
corner will be requested left open.
George Strieker, newly elected
graduate Excom representative, re
ported on plans for revitalizing the
graduate excom and graduate coun
cil.
Excom withdrew its support, of
the Liquor Resolution in view of its
rejection by the student body.
