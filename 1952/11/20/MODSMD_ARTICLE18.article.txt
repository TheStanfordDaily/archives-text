An exhibition of 25 paintings rep
resenting a group of the extreme
abstract ytists in America opened i
yesterday at the Stanford Art Gal
lery. The show will run through
Dec. 7.
The paintings were chosen from j
an exhibition originally selected for i
the Galerie de France in Paris. The j
show was designed to present to Pa- j
risians the work of the most ad- j
vanced abstractionists in the United
States.
The selection of paintings is
weighted on the uncompromisingly
abstract, side. Now on a national \
circuit under the auspices of the |
American Federation of Arts, the j
show has aroused considerable con
troversy among critics. *
Arshile Gorky's "Table Land- |
scape," William Baziotes' ''Woman |
and Bird." and Matta's "Composi- '
tion" are featured works in the j
show. Among the other contribu- j
tors are Jackson Pollock, Willem
DeKooning, Adolph Gottlieb, and
Bradley Tomlin .
