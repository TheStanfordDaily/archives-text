# Oskie Cremation Pyre Burned Yearly Since '98
## 
### DAVE BROWNWOOD 
Oskie won the Big Game last year, but he was burnt to a cinder
in the process.
The freshman Big Game Bonfire left the Golden Bear in ashes—
his condition after each Big Game rally since Stanford first built
a blazing pyre for Oskie's cremation over half a century ago.

The Stanford-Cal battle was al
ready traditional when Roblc's 1898
residents decided to make the
seventh Big Game Rally one to re
member. The grandmothers of the
Class of '56 moved outside when the
old Roble living room proved too
small a site.
Not even in (lie "good old days"
were California nights warm late
in November, so gallant Zetrs
rolled some barrels into a pile and
kindled them. Chivalry glowed;
spirit burned; the bonfire blazed;
and a tradition was born that has
yet to be broken.
A high spot in the bonfire's history
was the burning of the Cal "Big C"
fence in 1904. This once-piized pos
session of the Berkeley campus was
stolen and carted around the bay in
retaliation for Oskie's theft of the
Axe five years before.
Parts of the old boatliouse pro
vided wood in 1039, and the band
house porch will blaze this year.
Evil omens placed in the inferno
by Indian witchdoctors to defeat
Cal have included Oskie in effigy,
Oskie's coffin. Oskie drawn and
quartered, and Oskie's residence—
an edifice common in places where
running water isn't.
The year the bonfire was first made
an all-campus function, the Axe
was forged—and stolen. Not until
3(> years later was the trophy present
at a Big Game Rally.
Its presence added spectators as
well as spirit to the rally, for Doodles
Weaver led 10.000 rooters in the tra
ditional "Axe Yell" that night. The
next day, Nov. 23, 1935, the "Vow
Boys" did "Give 'em the Axe," 13-0,
and gained immortality by fulfilling
their promise made as "Vowing
Sophs" in 1932 never to lose a game
to Cal or to USC.

funeral pyre. The bear will be burnt at tonight's rally and bon
fire. —Daily photo by Vernon Dunn
