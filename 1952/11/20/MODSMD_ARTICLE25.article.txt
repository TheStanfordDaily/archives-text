# Your Chance Today

Another quarter, another draw. Except for
freshmen, all women, both on and off-campus,
may draw tor different residences today, ft is
our hope that each girl who uses this Stanford
privilege does so with sufficient information to
get the most from il.
Girls participating in today's drawing have
until 4:30 p.m. tomorrow to tarn back their num
bers. But many numbers are hastily thrown
back, although they are actually lower than
they look. To guard against such errors, Hous
ing Committee posts a list in the Housing Office
which shows how many girls drew, what their
numbers were, and their class standing. With
these facts, a girl can tell just how good her
number is and where it will get her.
But what if your number is really "no good?"
Then go on shrinkage next Tuesday or wait
until next quarter.
A new shrinkage rule goe3 into effect with
this drawing. The new ruling does not permit

a giil to change her mind about one of the resi
dences on her shrinkage list if it is offered to
her. Previously, a girl could turn down such a
vacancy, a policy which greatly complicated
the job of th« University and the Housing Com
mittee.
A girl going on shrinkage has her choice of
two plans. She may either:
1. Remain on shrinkage until registration for
next quarter or
2, Remain on shrinkage until two weeks after
registration for the next quarter.
But if there is a vacancy in one of the three
choices listed, she must accept it, no matter
which shrinkage plan she is on. It is not nec
essary, however, to state three choices il a girl
is interested in only one or two residences.
Understanding these procedures will make
drawing worth your while by helping the Stan
lord privilege work for everyone who uses it.
