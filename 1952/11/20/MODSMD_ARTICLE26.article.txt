# BULL SESSION

### VIC PALMIERI 
(Editor's note: By request of an overwhelming
number of Stanford men, The Daily is reprinting*
(he following classic by former Bull Sessioner Vic
Palmieri. The Bull Session first appeared in the
Drily on Oct. 10. 1950. Kam Freshman, who usually'
writes the Thursday Bull Session, has kindly re
linquished his space in favor of this service to the
Stanford male. The second half of his series on
' riow to Join a Committee'' will appeal' in the
Daily next week.)
Foi a long time now we've heard a lot of shouting
about tradition on this campus. From your first wing
meeting in Encina to that last little get-together in
Frost Amphitheater, all you hear is "tradition." "Tra
dition is the bond that unites the Stanford Family."
You hear about the Doodles

Weaver tradition, and the No
Butts on Quad Tradition, the
Little Dog on the Football Field
Tradition, and the Never Give the
Axe Yell Tradition.
There's the Say Hello to Every
body Tradition, the Keg Dances
Are Lousy Tradition, and the
Nine Out of Ten Girls in the State
Are Good Looking and the Tenth
One Goes to Stanford Tradition.

Nothing but people making speeches about tradi
tion, people working on Traditions Week, people
working to avoid Traditions Week . . . AND YOU
NEVER HEAR A WORD ABOUT THE GREATEST
TRADITION OF ALL!!! ... the one that has made
Stanford what it is today (bankrupt) . . . the one that
has always sent Stanford Men to the front (St. Mihiel,
Iwo Jima, Korea) . . . the BIG GAME NIGHT IS
DUTCH TRADITION!!!
Being that Big Game Night is now exactly one
month away, and being that I'm a real wheel around
here (I'm the only guy that's ever been rejected by
Rally Corn seven different times), I now proclaim the
time from October 11 to November 11 shall henceforth
be celebrated with fasting and prayer as SEGDOGD
Month . . . (She Either Goes Dutch Or Gets Ditched).
Only Ky-krisp and Bach Beer shall be eaten dur
ing this period in honor of the Stanford men of
yesteryear who gave their lives to start this holy
tradition.
Don't fail them, men!

Let's make SEODOGD Month a success and show
the world we respect bur Stanford heritage, and its
sacred traditions.
Speaking of traditions, 1 notice Stanford women
are taking their annual beating. Every year when
school opens and the roughs cciine back sleek and lat
from their green home pastures, it's the same story
. . . "geez! what spooks we got around here!"
Walk into any long on the RowVmd you'll think
you've stumbled on a bunch of 4H Clubbers, the
way the conversation runs to "pigs!" But the worst
are the freshmen. They moan so loud the first few
weeks, you'd think they trapped in a mon
astery.
But it always tickles nn old-timer like me to hear
how their tune changes about the middle of the
quarter. About that time, of course, the malcontents*
are beginning to resemble unicorns. Their summer
recollections don't make such good company on Satur
day nights any more, and the stock of Stanford women
starts a steady soar thai lasts till Jxine.
Of course, by the time you've been here a decade
or so nothing matters. You stand at Engineering
Corner when you're a freshman and watch them go
by and you'll swear there aren't five cute ones in the
school. Then as a sophomore, you're surprised to
see quite a few winsome little numbers go by. By the
time you're a junior 50 per cent look good to you,
and when you're a senior they all look beautiful.
Naturally though, the date situation around here
never had any terrors for me. That's because I'm
the guy all the Itohle sponsors try to get for blind
dates (they made a mistake and got me one who
could see one night, and she's still being treated for
hysteria). t
1 had a date with a girl was really cute once
though. I wouldn't say she was built, but she had
to have a stack permit to walk around Quad. But I
liker 'caire she was intelligent; in fact, she had a
straight "A" all through college (of course, she only
took classes where they graded on the curve).
Enough of this tripe . . . remember, men, you've
nothing to lose but the woman you love . . . observe
SEGDOGD Month.
THOUGHT FOR TODAY
I've never seen a Stanford Woman
1 never hope to be one.
But I'll tell you anyhow,
I'd rather be than see one.
