## U.S. Politics in Paris 
### 
(Editor's note 1 : The following letter was written
by Dan Chartonnier, who was an ASSU foreign
scholar last year. Chartonnier deseriLes the election
day celebration in Paris.)
To the Editor:
1 thought you might be interested in bearing about
the election-day we had in Paris, because, you see, we
voted and celebrated such a big day in Paris too . . .
According to an old tradition, the voting took place
at Harrys' Bar, 5 rue.Daunou ("Sink roo dough-noo"),
the rendez-vous for homesick American boozers in
Paris.
We voted 122 for Ike and 115 for Stevenson so that
Harry and all the American journalists to whom he
•gives hot tips expected a clear majority for Stevenson.
It has really been a surprise to find out that the
American people in Paris and the ones who stayed
in "the old country" (?) did vote the same way. Who
ever said that the American colony in Paris was a
bunch of snobs, wild fallows and book-worms? Un
!
j Although the French law does not require a thirsty
man to show his I.D., the crowd of gentlemen and
ladies who were bottle-necking at Harry's the other
llight was mainly composed of people slightly older
than the average drinker at Rossotti's, even on that
day when the Alumni come back to the Farm and
bring their grandmothers along. But this is just one
of tl'.ose things that no one can explain and that
have to be admitted as bare facts . . .
T suppose that you will be surprised that the first
news from a 1951-52 ASSTJ Foreign Student are con
nected with American politics, but there is nothing
much entertaining I could tell you about, except that
in two days I shall get rid of the free man's burden
and let the great old French Army take care of all
my .daily problems. They said they will feed me, and
5ive me a bed and dress me up at the expenses of the
tax payer. Since they will even give me some 10*'
per day, I suppose 1 better go (I forgot to tell you
that they would put me in jail if I happened to
"forget" that military service . . . ).
All the best to you, especially to all the friends I
left at Stanford. 1 do not have too much free time
to write but I don't forget . . .
