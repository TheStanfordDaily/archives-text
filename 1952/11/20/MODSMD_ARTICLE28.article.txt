# A 						Great Moment
## 
### 
After reading the book "Great Moments in Stanford
Sports" we feel there has been one subject left out.
No mention was made in the publication about Crew

at Stanford and particularly the fine performance of
Jim Fifer, Dewey Ilecht and Jim Beggs. Their show
ing in tlie pair oared shell with coxswain at the
Olympic tryouts last summer, showed that they too
had the fine spirit which was displayed by the other
great men in the hook.
Not only did they pool their money to buy the
shell, they practiced for over a half a year on their
own, besides rowing with the regular eight-oared
shell. This is lour to live hours a day, six days a
week. One of them even traveled for seven days to
to the race, sleeping iri the back of hia Car and
living on a hunk of Wisconsin cheese and a can of
ham. When they arrived in the East they only had
about two weeks to get back in condition alter their
long trip.
At last! After a stiff elimination race they made the
finals. There, they were matched against a powerful
Navy crew whose oarsmen had had four years of
experience in the strong Eastern league, and who
were considered two of the top individual oarsmen
in the nation. After trailing for fifteen - hundred
meters of the two-thousand meter race, the Stanford
shell finally caught and passed the Navy crew which
was rowing a fabulous mankilling stroke of between
thirty-six and forty-four strokes a minute. (Thirty
strokes a minute is good for a pair oared shell in
this type of race.) Suddenly, all seemed lost. Two
hundred meters from the end of the race Dewey
Hecht caught a "crab." However, with quick think
ing worthy of champions, they stopped rowing, set
the boat straight and rowed on to a photo-finish win
of the National Championships and the right to rep
lesent their country in the Olympic games at Helsinki.
Everyone was gripped by the emotion of the mo
ment. It seemed that the whole vast crowd of spec
tators was rooting for Stanford. A witness wrote of
the event in the November issue of the Stanford Re
view. "A hush came over the crowd as the an
nouncer said a photograph would have to be de
veloped before the results were Official. It would have
warmed the heart of any Stanfordite to have heard
the cheer that greeted the official verdict."
This exciting incident certainly belongs to the high
standards of courage and determination set by Stan
ford athletes. The fine tradition and spirit these men
showed truly earns them a place in the great mo
ments of Stanford sports.
