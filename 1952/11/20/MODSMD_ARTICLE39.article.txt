## Everybody Talks About It 
### Mike Hudson 
Everybody says that the only way
Stanford will whip Cal Saturday i<
to show the old Stanford spirit.
What exactly this spirit i.s, they
don't explain. Now how can we de
line it so that the boys will know
how to use it in the Big Game?
The only definition we have
be en able to find so lar is written
on a plaque hanging in the Cel
lar store. It is dedicated to the fa
mous untied 1947 team. It reads,
'Nine time<> out and nine tines
defeated, they never lost the will
to win. Theirs is the true Stan
ford spirit."
We happen to have witnessed the
1947 team in action, and il they rep
resent Stanford spirit, then Stanford
might as well forget this year's Big
Game. In 1947, Stanford was picked
for fourth in the conference, two
places ahead of California. During
the long, cold afternoons that fall,
we remember watching Santa Clara
and Stanford fumbling seven times
inside the 10-yard line before the
Brones stumbled to a 12-0 win. We
remember a mediocre Idaho team
showing real spirit in coming from
behind to edge Stanford, 19-10. We
remember backs like Moose' Meyers
and Jake Leicht tearing the Stan
lord line to shreds, while the-Card
offense sputtered hopelessly through
game after game. Finally, we re
<neml>er tht Big Game that year.
Cal that year had a new coach
in Pappy Waldorf, hut the same
old tired players that had won
only two games the year before.
Waldorf brought blocking and
tackling hack to Berkeley and
welded together a tough team. Af
ter they had squeaked by two or
three foes, they discovered they
could win and stin ted playing real
football. Still, when they met
USC, the one national power on
the Coast, they were drubbed
:J9-N (compared to CSC 14, Stan
ford 0).
Another factor seldom mentioned
in this contest is that Cal's third
string All-American fullback John
Graves was out of the contest. Nev
ertheless, Stanford played its best
football of the year against an over
confident Cal team and with a few
minutes remaining, they led 18-14.
Then, in a low moment in Stan
ford .sports history, Jackie Jensen
threw a short pass to Paul Keckley
mi the Bear 30. All Stanford had
to do was bring him down and hold
on a few minutes longer to win
their first game of the year and the
Big Game simultaneously; but the
back defending for the Cards, with
a clear shot at Keckley, stuck out

I his loot in tead and tried to trip j
I him. The surprised Keckley stepped i
over the outstretched leg and scam- '
pered for the score. No, except for j
| one player on that team, they should j
not be chosen to represent the Stan- |
j ford spirit.
We have only been following
Stanford football since 194(1. yet
we have seen and heard many ex
amples of what, lo us, represents
j the spirit that we like to think
| is the real Stanford spirit.
For instance, in 1940, Stanford
went undefeated. They won game
after game in the closing minutes
by one touchdown or less. After!

Stanford's Rose Bowl win, quar- j
terback Frankie Albeit was asked
I why he hadn't used a short pass J
! play, which gained 40 yards, more I
I often during the season. Here- j
| plied. "I've been saving it for when
!we needed it." This cocky spirit.
| melodramatic though it may be,
would be part of our recipe for |
I Stanford spirit. While the rest of
j the country was wondering how
I Stanford kept winning, Albert knew
! each week that the Cards couldn't J
lose.
The key game of the year that
i season was with Washington.
Sophomore guard Chuck Taylor
was playing against Kudy Mucha, !
j the Huskies' All-American center, j
I and guard Kay Frankowski, All -
American in 1941. The Huskies
were leading, 10-0. late in the !
third quarter and had a second
j down three on the Card 28-yard I

line. Three times the Huskies'
Walt Harrison attempted *o hit
' between Mucha and Frankowski.
Each time Taylor piled up the
play. lie simply decided that he
wasn't going to be moved out,
I And he wasn't.
The one bright spot in the afore
mentioned 1947 season was George
Quist. Quist broke his leg early in
the year. In the Big Game, he came
back with his leg still in bad shape.
On offense he carried the ball 11
times for 54 yards. On defense, he
was the home-plate in Stanford's
seven-diamond defense. He played
! the game of two normal linebackers
in what trainer Connie Jarvis
called the mo t inspirational per
| formance he • has ever seen on a
1 football field.
Finally, we might look at the
i 1951 Stanlord-USC game when a
highly rated prep quarterback found
his greatness at an unfamiliar posi
tion, defensive back. Dick Horn
i batted away blocker after blocker
to nail Johnny Williams and then Al
Carmichael to prevent two Trojan
scores.
The confidence of Albert, (he
stubbornness of Taylor, the "guts"
play of George Quist, and the
come - through ability of Horn.
None of these boys were specially
endowed football players. They
were all .■■mailer - than - average
football players, but maybe they
were outstanding because they
possessed the true Stanford spirit.
They didn't settle for moral wins.
They could not be beaten because
they WOULD not be beaten.
! Maybe that is the essence of the
| Stanford spirit.
