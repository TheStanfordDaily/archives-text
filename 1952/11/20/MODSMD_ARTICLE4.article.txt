# Bonfire Blaze Extinguished
## 
### 
Rapid action by the Stanford Fire
Department early yesterday morn
ing quenched a premature bonfire
blaze and preserved the Golden
Bear's bier for tonight's rally.
Wearing Stanford jackets and
rooters' caps, six unidentified ar
sonists succeeded in lighting the fire
at 6 a.m. yesterday. Approximately
10 feet of the fire became ashes be
fore the firefighters halted the blaze.
"Although gasoline was used," ex
plains Chief John Marston, "the en
tire bonfire did not burn because it
was lit from the top."
Freshmen raised the structure to
40 feet by working throughout the
night. Work today will continue
until fire time, according to Com
mittee Chairman Chuck Kashima.
Shortly before work was halted in
yesterday's dawn, the six men who
subsequently attempted to destroy
the bonfire posed as freshmen and
pitched in on construction. They
remained to "guard" the fire when
the other workers left Lake Lag
about 6 a.m. Three of the pseudo-
Stanfordites kindled the gasoline
soaked structure as the others dis
tracted sophomore Terry Lindsay
who was passing by on his motor
cycle.
The six had left in a black Mer
cury before Lindsay saw flames
shoot into the sky. He motorcycled
to the Fire Department and aroused
the firemen. With one engine and
the water truck from the Corpora
tion Yard, Chief Marston and his
men downed the blaze in half an .
hour.
