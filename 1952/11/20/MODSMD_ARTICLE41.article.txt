You've heard of marathons, you've
heard of walkathons, but the one
and only Peerless Pickers' limpa
thon is turning into its eighth lap
this weekend.
The rash of upsets, over the past
few weeks has left the sportsmen,
sportswrit'ers, and averages stagger
ing, and has left the team of A 1
| Kirkland, Jim Vick, and. Coach
j Chuck Taylor a full fimp ahead of
I the pack.

At present the lumbering lothar
ios of the typewriters are tripping it
I lightly and fantastically at .661,
I while the footballers are tripping it
i a little less lightly at .667.
Vick and Kirkland had the best
average for the week, picking six
winners apiece and lifting them
selves into first and second places
respectively.
Phil German and Mike "I tied in

the clutch" Hudson both had iden
tical slates last week, both "tied"
with 5 and 5, both were relegated
to second and fourth respectively,
and both were last seen laying a
trap for Dick Maltzman, Daily de
livery boy, who gave them the tips
on the "sure winners."
In sixth place, holding of! the
last-minute surge of Coach Taylor,
is Daily Sports Editor Larry Cahn.
His last-week effort of 4 and G left
him only one game ahead of Taylor,
who netted himself a 5 and 5 count.
This poor showing was summed
up briefly by the battered editor
with a simple, "It's hard to pick
winners and keep the sportsmen so
ber."â€”D. M.
