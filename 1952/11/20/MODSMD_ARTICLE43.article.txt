# Crist Declared Out Of Saturday's Game
## 
### LARRY CAHN 
Skip Crist will miss his last Big
Game. The Stanford halfback was
declared out yesterday by doctors
after thorough examination follow
ing a concussion picked up in the
USC game.
Chuck Taylor said that with Crist
out. Bob Mathias will probably start
at right half. Jarvis Watson at full,
and either Ron Cook or Charlie
Brazel at left half.
The other news was on the
brighter side. The Indians went
through the roughest work of the
week, stressing offensive and del'en-

sive patterns, and looked sharp.
Mike Anderson, up from the junior
varsity, looked \'ood running, as did
Mathias,
Len Mayrhofer rejoined the squad
and worked without pads. He will
probably see action at either guard
or tackle spot depending on the con
dition of his leg Saturday.
Taylor is yet to show signs of his
former optimism. The young Stan
ford mentor has expressed fear over
just how long his ten injured men
Out of the 22 comprising offense and
defense will hold up.
