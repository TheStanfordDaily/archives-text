# Williams Feeds Football Crowds
## 
### SUE WHEAT 
Walk down to Angell Field
some afternoon (that's the prac
tice track-field near the stadium),
wander into the little brick field
house there, and in the first of
fice on the right you will see a
man pouring over orders, re
ceipts, and inventory lists.
That man is Hal Williams, whose
job it is to food Stanford's hungry
football crowds every Saturday.
Any housewife who has ever
stocked away food supplies for a
family can appreciate the skillful
guesswork it takes to "come out
even." Imagine, then, concessionaire
Williams' problem when he is or
dering not 12 hot dogs, but 12,000!
The size of food orders depends
on the size of the crowds, and the
size of the crowds, as Williams puts
it, depends on "perplexing intangi
bles."
"Weather is my biggest bugaboo,"
he says. Pain and shine can make
the difference between thousands of
customers.
Another factor controlling attend
ance is team prestige. Fickle crowds
will increase in number as a team
builds up victories, and will cor
respondingly decrease when a team
starts losing.
For example, 1947 (the year
Stanford lost nine straight) was a
poor season for the stadium con
cessionaire, whereas last season,
(nine wins, two losses) was "ex
cellent." This year's business, while
it started out well, has since
dropped off.
"TV doesn't help any either," Wil
liams reports. For this year's Mich
igan game, Williams did not account
for TV and set up as many
people as arrived.
Williams, in ordering his supplies,
figures about one hot dog to every
three persons and one cold drink to
every one person. ("Supplies" in
clude cokes, Eskimo Pies, orange
pop, hot dogs, Hersheys, cigarettes,
peanuts, and Crackerjacks.)
In the Idaho game of '46. Stan
ford's first year of football after
the war, and Williams' first year as
concessionaire for Stanford, Wil
liams reports that he set a record
by selling two and a half drinks
per person. "It was a pretty hot
day,"he recalls.
At the Michigan game three years
ago, he sold 80,000 drinks and ran
out.
Working for Williams are some 200
sellers — college, high school, and

grammar school boys who man the
wholesale booths and carry food di
rectly in to the customer in the
stadium.
The younger ones start out by
selling ten cent items and gradually
work up to the more expensive ones.
They get 15 per cent of their gross
sales. The boys work under an honor
system—one which evidently works,
too. In six years Williams has had
only three "walkaways"—sellers who
pocket their receipts and walk off.
The boys arc allowed to sell any
where in the stadium. Some of
them like to watch the game, and
then sales drop. The ideal sort of
stadium to work, the hoys will tell
you, is not a packed one. hut one
which is about three-fourths filled
and allows freer movement to the
sellers.
Williams has found that the Stan
ford rooting section eats more by
proportion than the rooters of the
visiting team. He is unable to ex
plain this phenomenon, however.
* Williams works for the Athletic
Department under an independent
contract. He pays his own insurance
and takes his own risks. Risks are
lessened, however, by the fact that
he buys his food on consignment
and may return what he does not
sell.

Williams has found that the Stan
ford rooting section eats more by
proportion than the rooters of the
visiting team. He is unable to ex
plain this phenomenon, however.
* Williams works for the Athletic
Department under an independent
contract. He pays his own insurance
and takes his own risks. Risks are
lessened, however, by the fact that
he buys his food on consignment
and may return what he does not
sell.
Walk down to Angell Field
some afternoon (that's the prac
tice track-field near the stadium),
wander into the little brick field
house there, and in the first of
fice on the right you will see a
man pouring over orders, re
ceipts, and inventory lists.
That man is Hal Williams, whose
job it is to food Stanford's hungry
football crowds every Saturday.
Any housewife who has ever
stocked away food supplies for a
family can appreciate the skillful
guesswork it takes to "come out
even." Imagine, then, concessionaire
Williams' problem when he is or
dering not 12 hot dogs, but 12,000!
The size of food orders depends
on the size of the crowds, and the
size of the crowds, as Williams puts
it, depends on "perplexing intangi
bles."
"Weather is my biggest bugaboo,"
he says. Pain and shine can make
the difference between thousands of
customers.
Another factor controlling attend
ance is team prestige. Fickle crowds
will increase in number as a team
builds up victories, and will cor
respondingly decrease when a team
starts losing.
For example, 1947 (the year
Stanford lost nine straight) was a
poor season for the stadium con
cessionaire, whereas last season,
(nine wins, two losses) was "ex
cellent." This year's business, while
it started out well, has since
dropped off.
"TV doesn't help any either," Wil
liams reports. For this year's Mich
igan game, Williams did not account
for TV and set up as many
people as arrived.
Williams, in ordering his supplies,
figures about one hot dog to every
three persons and one cold drink to
every one person. ("Supplies" in
clude cokes, Eskimo Pies, orange
pop, hot dogs, Hersheys, cigarettes,
peanuts, and Crackerjacks.)
In the Idaho game of '46. Stan
ford's first year of football after
the war, and Williams' first year as
concessionaire for Stanford, Wil
liams reports that he set a record
by selling two and a half drinks
per person. "It was a pretty hot
day,"he recalls.
At the Michigan game three years
ago, he sold 80,000 drinks and ran
out.
Working for Williams are some 200
sellers — college, high school, and

grammar school boys who man the
wholesale booths and carry food di
rectly in to the customer in the
stadium.
The younger ones start out by
selling ten cent items and gradually
work up to the more expensive ones.
They get 15 per cent of their gross
sales. The boys work under an honor
system—one which evidently works,
too. In six years Williams has had
only three "walkaways"—sellers who
pocket their receipts and walk off.
The boys arc allowed to sell any
where in the stadium. Some of
them like to watch the game, and
then sales drop. The ideal sort of
