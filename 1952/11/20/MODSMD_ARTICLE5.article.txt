# Protests Block Mangini Expansion
## 
### 
Mangini'.s application to expand
bar and restaurant facilities was
denied yesterday by the San Mateo
County Planning Commission.
About. 15 neighbors showed up at
yesterday's hearing in Redwood City
to protest the expansion. They
brought a petition signed by 80 resi
dent. of the Alpine Road district,
where Mangini's is loeated, asking
that permission be denied.
The neighbors said that they ob
jected to the expansion because of:
1. The noise from the tavern and
from the picnic grounds loudspeak
er.
2. The Alpine Road traffic danger.
The fact that Mangini's has
twice in the last four months been
called up before the District Attor
ney on complaints of "public nui
sance."
Zoning rcgulatons on Alpine
Roarl require Commission approval
for any commercial expansion.
