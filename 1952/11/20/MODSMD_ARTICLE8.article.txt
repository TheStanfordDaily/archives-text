The Communist, prisoner issue has
been one of the key stumbling
blocks in the Korean truce nego

return home. The UN negotiators
have insisted that no prisoner
should be forced to go home against
his will.
Wiley's report that Eisenhower
backs the current American stand

issue came as member nations of
the UN waited anxiously for some

lieve that Eisenhower's position di
fered from that which has been pur
sued by the U.S This was his first
public affirmation of his position,
however.
