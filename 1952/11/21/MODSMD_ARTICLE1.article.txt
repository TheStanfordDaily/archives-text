Cal raiders didn't iialt work on
the bonfire, but gravity did.
At 2 p.m. yesterday' the weight of
GO feel of wood caused several sup
ports to weaken. Although the bon
fire did not collapse, it shifted and
became too unstable to hold either
more wood or the weight of workers.
Due tr> the mishap, much wood
intended for the blaze remains in
Lake Lag and will be burned today.
