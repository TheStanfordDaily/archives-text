# INDIANS PREPARE TO AXE THE BEAR
## Hears Favored In 55th Classic 
### LARRY CAHN Sports Editor, the Stanford Daily 
Stanford and California football elevens will "shoot the works"
when they collide in the 55th Big Game in Memorial Stadium
tomorrow at 1:30.
A bowl bid is not at stake, not even a high National rating, but
he winner will wind up with the traditional Axe and a successful
season.
The 80,000 who will paek the Berkeley Bowl and the countless thousands
who will view the clash on television, are in agreement that this is The
3ig Game, not a battle of "also rans" as some claim in view of the USC
JCLA Rose Bowl decider in the southland.
And because this is the Big Game, the game of surprises and the un
usual, the 13 point odds favoring the Golden Bears can be just about tossed
>ut and every rhance can be afforded Stanford to rise to the occasion and
jpset California.
If Stanford should turn the trick, Coach Chuck Taylor's second year
is head coach would he as successful as his first when be took his Indians
to the Pasadena classic. And if the Bears lost, it would mark even more of
a failing season than the one that is already the worst since Pappy Waldorf
took over the reins of California football in 1947.
Is a Win in the Cards?
But can the Indians win? Is it in the Cards to upset the Bears and bring
-lome the Axe to a student body which has never seen it as Stanford prop
erty and to old timers who are forgetting what it looks like?
Chuck Taylor has voiced the opinion that his squad can do it, but
here are all important ifs. "We hope we can stop them; if wc want to
vin we had better stop them," Chuck cautions, and he adds, emphatically,
'Our offense and defense will have to do a tremendous job and when the
lefense gets the ball then the offense will have to do something with it.
3o I think we can win? Anything can happen in a Big Game. It is pos
;ible we can win, but if we do, we are going to have to play very out
standing ball."
It's not a bright picture that the invading Injuns axe running into when
hey break camp and head for Strawberry Canyon. Statistics favor the
Bears heavily.
The Bears have amassed over a nine game stretch 3.305 yards of rush
ing and passing while the Cards could gather only 2.866. This figures to
oe a difference of about five football field lengths, which is a lot of yardage.
Stanford Side Loaded With Injuries
The enormous number of injuries on the Stanford side only adds dispair.
Df the 22 offensive and defensive men that Taylor will alternate at game's
beginning, nine will be cripples and how long they will last under a Bear
battering is doubtful.
Defensively, Dave Eldridge, Chuck Essegian, Ron Eadie, Al Kirldand
and John Stanton will be nursing old wounds. In fact Kirkland and Stanton,
having been out of action for a considerable period, may not open and may
be replaced by Barry Smith and Dick Gnnt.
Offensively, Skip Crist is definitely out. Though he will suit up the
Skipper will make only a token appearance, if any. in his last Big Game;
but that may be an important appearance, because Crist can kick field
|oals and that might be his spot chance Saturday.
What's more. John Ludeke, Whitey Pyle, Len Mayrhofer, and Ron Cook,
though all probable starters, won't be in perfect health.
Starting Lineups Still Not Certain
These injuries make a starting lineup decision difficult until the final
moments. The opening backfield appears to shape up with Bob Mathiass
it right half. Jack Gebert at quarter, Jarvis Watson at full, and the left
half spot going to either Cook nr Charlie Brazel. All are ready and all
:an go at any backfield post. It is likely that no final decision will ho mnde
until after the team has settled itself in their East Bay hideaway following
a light Friday workout.
However the Berkeleyites have also been bothered by injuries this
year. In early season they were hard struck by key men being hurt and
removed from their tackles's spots. But this weakness seems cured,
and the gaps filled. Last week their first string quarterback, Billy Mais
following the example of Indian Bob Garrett, got himself banged up and
won't see action. However his fill-in Ray Willsey, like our Mr. Gebert, has
done a fine job and Taylor believes Willsey is to be feared ju.st as much
if not more than Mais would have been.
With the injury- situation giving another advantage to the Bears and
coupling this with the statistics the Cards have earned themselves the
underdog spot, one very desirable in Big Games because of an accompany
ing lift and an attitude of "we have nothing to lose, everything to win."
But it's no good to assume an underdog role if you arc. not going to try
and shake it off come Saturday. Taylor has said his boys will "try like
hell." But the question is what are they going to try?
There's little doubt that the Indians are going to try and beat the Bears
by throwing the ball. Chuck Taylor has said that. "We may throw the
hall (iO times, provided wc have our hands on it that much." And with QP.
Gebert throwing as accurately as he has in practice this week, and with
ends Sam Morley and John Steinberg and backs Mathias and Cook pulling
in his tosses the Cards could well move overhead.
The Bears don't have the finest pass defense. UCLA and Washington
both bombed the Bears to death, especially with the short pass. And with
1,281 of Stanford's total 2,866 offensive yards coming through the air it's
â€¢;afo to say the Cards will fill the air with footballs tomorrow.
However the Cards offensive running game should not be entirely dis
counted. A.s Taylor points out, "We are third in the Conference in this
