# A 						Senior's Last Wish
## 
### 
By 8:15 last night, the Big ftame bonfire was
as flaming a pyre as any in the four years we
have been at Stanford. The preceding rail/ was
as frenzied an example of Stanford Spirit as
we've ever yelled in. The Gaieties afterward
put us in the proper mood for a Big Game week
end.
But there's only one accomplishment that
could make a senior's last Big Game weekend
really successful: A win by the Cards!
There are many around the campus who have
been here four years and have never seen the
vaunted Stanford Spirit rise up and smite the
mighty Bears—who have never seen the Axe
in Stanford's possession. There were more than
a few seniors last year who wept tears of frus
tration, when they realized that the 20 to 7 de
feat meant they wouldn't see a Stanford victory
over Cal while they were in school. And there
are even some grad students around who can
remember that over the last six year period the
Bears have never been skinned by the Indians.
We realize fully that it seems like a lot of
nerve to ask 37 quys to heat their brains out

trying to win a football game for the vicarious
pleasure of some 25,000 other alumni and
students \vho will then be abl$ to saj* that
"they" beat Cal.
But still and all we'd like to see the footballers
give it a thought. Maybe it's worthwhile to
go all out for the school.
It's going to require giving every thing every
player has and maybe some more. Maybe it'll
even help if the rooting section screams its head
off like the Daylight blowing its whistle in a
long tunnel. Maybe it'll even require a few
resounding Axdi yells.
But we're going to put every ounce of body
eriglish, every ounce of mental telepathy, and
every ounce of hope and yelling we possess
into that ball game, and we'd like to see the
rest of the school do so too. Because here's a
year that Stanford—providing it pulls every
stop in the book—doesn't have to roll over and
play patsy for the Bears, doesn't have to rise
halfway and be content with a tie, but CAN —
if it wants to BEAT CAL.

been here four years and have never seen the
vaunted Stanford Spirit rise up and smite the
mighty Bears—who have never seen the Axe
in Stanford's possession. There were more than
a few seniors last year who wept tears of frus
tration, when they realized that the 20 to 7 de
feat meant they wouldn't see a Stanford victory
over Cal while they were in school. And there
are even some grad students around who can
remember that over the last six year period the
Bears have never been skinned by the Indians.
We realize fully that it seems like a lot of
nerve to ask 37 quys to heat their brains out

trying to win a football game for the vicarious
pleasure of some 25,000 other alumni and
students \vho will then be abl$ to saj* that
"they" beat Cal.
But still and all we'd like to see the footballers
give it a thought. Maybe it's worthwhile to
go all out for the school.
It's going to require giving every thing every
player has and maybe some more. Maybe it'll
even help if the rooting section screams its head
off like the Daylight blowing its whistle in a
long tunnel. Maybe it'll even require a few
resounding Axdi yells.
But we're going to put every ounce of body
eriglish, every ounce of mental telepathy, and
every ounce of hope and yelling we possess
into that ball game, and we'd like to see the
rest of the school do so too. Because here's a
year that Stanford—providing it pulls every
stop in the book—doesn't have to roll over and
play patsy for the Bears, doesn't have to rise
halfway and be content with a tie, but CAN —
if it wants to BEAT CAL.

By 8:15 last night, the Big ftame bonfire was
as flaming a pyre as any in the four years we
have been at Stanford. The preceding rail/ was
as frenzied an example of Stanford Spirit as
we've ever yelled in. The Gaieties afterward
put us in the proper mood for a Big Game week
end.
But there's only one accomplishment that
could make a senior's last Big Game weekend
really successful: A win by the Cards!
