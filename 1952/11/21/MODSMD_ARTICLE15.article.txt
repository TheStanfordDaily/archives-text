# The
						Big Test
## 
### 
Tomorrow will be the big lest—a test for the
ootball team and a test lew: us, the rooters.
Win, lose, or tie the Big Game, we, the Stan
ord rooters, will be expected to conduct our
,elves at Berkeley in the spirit of the University,
."•'riends and alumni of Stanford will be watch
ng us over television, and our opponents will
)e watching our good sportsmanship from
across the field.
Rally Com and Fundamental Standard Com
mittee can only give their advice on how to be
good rooters. Don't wds'e this advice. Think a
little.
Rally Com gives the following Big Game
Poi.it 5 program on procedure for tomorrow's
event:
1. If you know any students who are with
out transportation to Berkeley, give them a ride.
Let's put into practice the Stanford family tra-

dition. Ask in your dorms and at the village if
anyone is lacking transportation to the game.
We need rooters.
2. Dont' forget your game tickets and your
student body cards.
3. On entering the stands, fill up the rooting
section first. Th2 sections will be mixed.
4. Follow the yell leaders at all times. Un
organized yells and bad conduct are disturb
ing and uneffective.
5. Remember the Cal-S'.anford non-aggres
sion pact. Leaders of both schools have signed
the agreement, and we want more friendly re
lations with our rivals across the Bay.
The Big Game can only be as successful as
we the student rooters make it.
The team has shown they want the Axe, now
it is our turn to show wo are deserving of it.
