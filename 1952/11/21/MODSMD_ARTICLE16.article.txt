This one's on Skip and something called the Stan
ford Spirit.
The guys on the football team and his fraternity
brothers call him "Bonzo," but he doesn't like the
name. He was christened Frank Lee Crist.
Skip Crist won't play in the Big Game. Bob Hooks
of USC saw to that. Crist received a mild concus
sion, and the chances were 50-50 that he could go in
tho Ri« r.nmo R.,t n,. Pr.fl-.

down with him two days ago and
said, "You'd better not play. The
ga ne may seem pr etty big to you
now, but you've got 50 years of
life ahead of you, and if you got
hit again, it might be pretty
serious."
Skip has been a "touyh luck"
p'ayer ever since he was a fresh
man.
He was the sparkplug of the

championship frosh team until he hurt his knee. *lt
healed enough for him to come back for the Cal frosh
game and spearhead a sensatidnal victory over 01z.se
wski, Mais, and the gang.
That summer, the medics operated 011 his knee
and it plagued him intermittently for the next three
years. Last season, fullback Bob Meyers was in
jured, and the hard-working Crist &ot his chance
t:> play. That week in practice, Crist injured the
oilier knee and was on the shelf again.
Several contests slipped by, all Stanford victories,
and then came the titanic against USC. The score was
tied, 20 to 20, with only four minutes remaining.
Dutch Fehring sent a fresh Skip in at line backer and
told him to watch out for a pass to the quarterback.
He followed those instructions so well that he inter
cepted and set up Stanford's winning touchdown, a
touchdown that must be rated as the sweetest in the
last 50 years. Stanford would not have won the TCC
last year it it hadn't been for Skip.
He had earned that starting position, and he never
relinquished it until a tackle in this season's Wash
ington State game knocked his knee out of joint
again. Skip was sidelined for three mare weeks,
lie came back in the second half of the UCLA
game. And all he did was carry the hall 8 times for

50 yards and a 6.25 average against the Bruins' rock
ribbed line.
How does Chuck Taylor feel about Crist? Listen
to him: "As far as I'm concerned, Skip is the number
one man on the squad. That kid has all the determi
nation, spirit, and strength in the world."
Parenthetically, it should be said that Crist is one
of the team "characters." It's a team joke about how
he is always doing the t'ght thing the wrong way.
Take, for example, the time that he by mistake packed
half his football uniform in someone else's bag and
arrived at Pullman, Washington, with only half a uni
form. Or about the tine he by mistake put some
sticky substance instead of oil in the joint in his
knee brace just before a game and bad the brace
practically lock up on him.
But at the beginning of the article, we said that
this one was to be on Skip and on the Stanford Spirit.
Hear trainer Connie Jaivis, who is as close to
the Stanford football picture as the coaches: "When
we win that game on Saturday, you can bet that
Skip will play a big part. No, lie won't be able to
play, but all week he's been out at practice, yelling
the guys on, filing them up, although he knows he
won't even get to touch the ball. He's going to play
an important psychological part."
Last night, Skip who loves to play football more
than anyone else 1 know, told me, "I had almost re
signed myself to not playing. Then I came out to
practice and saw the team work out. Boy, it really
• hurts to know that I'm not going to be in there."
In short, Crist could luive stayed away from prac
tice. Going to thqr workouts was nothing but mental
torture, but he felt it his duty to "be there." And
there he was, yelling, "Thataway to run, Ron (Cook)
. . . C'mon, hit those guys hard, Charley, . . . Niee
block, Mantis (Steinberg)."
Chuck Taylor can only take two offensive and de
fensive teams over to Cal. One of the players will
be Skip Crist, who will suit up. He won't play, but
apparently Taylor considers him valuable enough
from a spiritual and psychological point of view to
bring him instead of a healthy man.
Did someone say you couldn't put your finger on
the Stanford Spirit?
