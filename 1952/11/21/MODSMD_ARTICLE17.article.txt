# Another Slant on Bonfires
## 
### 
'o the Editor:
The Big Game bonfire is ridiculous. About six or
even hundred people lose sleep and waste time
,p trash for the sake of a few "Oh's" and "Ah's" dur
ig the brief moments when the blaze soars highest,
t is perhaps even a great waste of time thaiv the
writing of this article.
Can't we be original? Everybody has bonfires.
,Ve build 'em to roast hot or to keep warm. They
lave 'em at high school rallies. Hell, the cave men
>vcn had them. By now l"ie bonfire should be coni
nonplace.
V* T hy not have an explosion* 1 Perhaps some powder
company would be eager to donate six or seven
hundred cases of explosives toward our cause. It is
c rt lin that the competition as to the size of the
c p'osives will be much keener than it was in the
c so of bonfires, since the dimensions of the initial
m ;ss gives no indication as to the of the cataclysm
that results. For this reason ;dso more students would

be interested.
Kadi year the Lake would become deeper per
r.itting a larger explosion the following year. Per
haps we could even have an H-bomb test in Lake
Lag, thereby providing the Government with a test
ing site and gixing the Stanford students n "Com
mand Performance" each November.
Any other alternatives are obviously out of the
question. Earthquakes, toronadoes, thunderstorms,
and the like could not be arranged unless we reach
an understanding with the Gentleman Upstairs. For
these, and the possibility ol Lake Lag becoming an
uctive volcano, we can only hope.
For the die-hards who still prefer the bonfire, a
technicolor picture of this year's bonfire could be
taken, preserved, and could be shown at the Gaieties
each year—no strain, no pain.
