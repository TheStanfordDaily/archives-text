WASHINGTON. Nov. 20 (UP) â€”
Republicans and some Democrats
today generally hailed President
elect Dwight D. Eisenhower's new
UOP cabinet choices as "outstand
ing" and "splendid."
They predicted quick Senate con
firmation of John Foster Dulles as
Secretary of State, Charles E. Wil
son of 'General Motors as Defense
Secretary, and Gov. Douglas McKay
of Oregon as Secretary of the In
terior.
State Department officials ex
pressed approval of Dulles' appoint
ment, citing his long record in for
eign affairs hnd his recent successes
with Far Eastern problems and the
Japanese peace treaty.
Labor union sources gave Wilson
qualified approval. They said they
would watch him "warily" in view
of his wartime proposals for a 45-
hour work week. They added,, how
ever, that he has been in "better
favor" since he granted the CIO
Auto Workers' Union the first live
year wage contract in history.
