34 Jim Dillon 204 LE 185 Sam Morley fiO
Dillon is a big transfer from Columbia. He nas been sick rno;t of the
season, but apparently will b« ready tomorrow. He is a rough blocker,
but when a pass-entcher is needed, Hal Ellis takes over.
Morley is one of the bright spots for the Cards in an otherwise so-so
year. He has caught 36 passes, including nine last week, and has won
praise from Card pud opposing coaches alike for his blocking ability. I
EDGE TO STANFORD.
76 Glen Gulvin 208 LT 225 Jim Vick 7
Gulvin is playing with two knee braces, so he can't move farther than
five yards in any direction, on' any play. Although be was a great prospect,
now he serves as little more than an object of curiosity.
Vlck wi'l he capping three years of outstanding play with tomorrow's
battle. His booming block sprung Bill Rogers loose on his record-break
ing 96-yard iauiit. one of many line blocks by the big senior. Look for
Vick, the heaviest Card on the field, to give the Bears a rough day to
morrow.—EDGE TO STANFORD.
69 Tom Dutton 195 LG 109 Phil Wilson 68 J
Pappy claims that Dutton is the finest running guard he has ever
coached. He leads the Bears' hectic end sweeps and i.s the only Cal line
man we would pick over Wilson.
Wilson gets our vote as being the most improved Card player, He
played a great game against USC's All-American Elmer Withoite. The
stubby Wilson will be a spark in what should be a great Card line next
year.—EDGE TO CAL
51 Tevis Martin 20-1 C 195 Jerry Goldberg 25
Martin has edged the veteran Leighton Hahn for the starting berth.
■ Although we have yet to see Martin in action, we do know Hahn is a fine
I center, so Martin must be a fine pivot-man too.
Goldberg is another strong sophomore whose only fault has been his
lack of experience. The Card coaches all praise Goldberg for his speed
off the mark. He has conquered bis early season sloppincss in centering
to the quarter-back, and has turned into a fine pivot-man.—EDGE TO
CAL.
38 Hal Norris 190 RG Lcn Mayrhofer til
Norris is a sophomore line-backer, but ho has been shuffled into the
j offensive line to fill a large vacancy. He has partially filled the gap, but
I he's nothing sensational.
Mayrhofer, a transfer from St. Mary's, is a real hustler. 13c is the one
Card lineman who bits bis man and then runs down field ala Bob Tone IT
of the 49ers, and knocks someone else down, lie's a good ball player.
Mayrhofer was hurt last week ami INad Bcvak may see plenty of action.
—EVEN (because of injuries to Mayrhofer.)
Don Curran 210 RT 215 John Ludcke 43
Cal has two fine tackles at this position, Don Curran and Ralph Kreuger.
Both may lie carted out after one play, in which case Dick Day will tnke
| over. Day's knee may also give, and Vince Maiorana and Bob Worrell may |
j take over. II Curran and/or Kreuger can stay healthy, the Bears will have !
i a strong man at the tackle post.
Ludcke is another of a multitude of outstanding soph linemen. Al
though he lias been bothered by a sore ankle, he lias edged out veterans
Carter Pylc and John Broderick for the starting berth. He and Phil
Wilson put on a demoniac blocking exhibition in Stanford's slaughter «<f
San Jose State. Pyie (right) will see action here t'>o.—EDGE 'lO CAL.
80 Dave Hood 205 HE 195 John Steinberg 12
Hood and the oft-injured Boh Deal alternate at this post. Both are good
blockers, with Hood getting the starting call because ot his blocking ability.
I Hood broke the Cal record last year with 13 catches.
Compare this with Steinberg's 25 catches already this year. Steinberg
is a little weak in the blocking department, however. It's encouraging to
note that Steinberg, four other starters and Norm Manoogian will return
to the offensive line next year. Four of the Bears' offensive line w ill be
back.—EVEN.
25 Ray Willsey 170 t v >B 180 Jack Gcbert S
Stanford had a tough break when Billy Mais hurt his hand, became
now Willsey, the best ol Cal's pitiful crew of quarterbacks will start. The
scatter-armed Sammy Williams may take over l! Wilbey .should he unable
! to find the mark.
Gcbert put on a wild display last week against Oregon. Although he
had his bad moments, be was better than any one dared hope in bis
premier performance. He is the Card's hig hope to upset the Bears.
EDGE TO STANFORD.
2\ Don Johnson 180 LIIB 181 Ron Cook 57 1
Johnson is a fast back who can go all the way any time he sees daylight.
He went for 96 yards against UCLA for Cal's only score. Although he has
been bottled up most of the season, he i.s still one of the nation's most
{ explosive backs.
Cock maj finally see action after missing the last three games. He's a
real speed burner. Chuck Brazcl, a hard-runner and outstanding blocker,
I will probably see plenty of duty too.—EDGE TO CAL.
11 BP 1 Fowcll 175 RHB 201 Bob Mathias 49
Powell is another will-of-the-wisp scooter who can go any time he
' sees daylight. He hasn't seen any daylight since the Santa Clara game, but
he s a fine back. When the defense starts to tire, Waldorf puts in the
lightning-like Paul Larson, our vote for America's best second-stringer, to
| add to the score with his seven yard bursts.
The hard-running Skip Crist lipped oIT 64 yards against USC's de
fensive wall and received a broken nose and brain concussion for his
trouble. He is a doubtful starter tomorrow. Fullback Bob Mathias will
probably start here. Mathias has been fumbling, but other than that, he
is a fine back. He is especially tough to bring down in an open field, and
his 571 yards rushing make him 11?e best Card ground-gainer since
Lloyd Merriman picked up 672 yards in iOHi. With his great come-through
ability, it would be iusi like M:ithias to break up the Big Game with a
touchdown jaunt. —EVEN.
36 John Olszewski 195 FB 195 Jarvis Watson 59
Olszewski is about four fumbles away from being All-American full- i
back. lies still the hardest-running back in the country and probably tHe I
best blocker. In addition he needs about 120 more yards to lop Hugh j
; MeEllhenny s three year PCC rushing mark. If lie can shake off his fumhl- !
j itis. he should have a field day against the Cards.
Jarvis Watson who lokcd good against San Jose, but didn't take the
ball last week will go at fullback. —EDGE TO CAL.

Dillon is a big transfer from Columbia. He nas been sick rno;t of the

but when a pass-entcher is needed, Hal Ellis takes over.
Morley is one of the bright spots for the Cards in an otherwise so-so

Martin has edged the veteran Leighton Hahn for the starting berth.
■ Although we have yet to see Martin in action, we do know Hahn is a fine

Goldberg is another strong sophomore whose only fault has been his
