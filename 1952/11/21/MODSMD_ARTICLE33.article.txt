83 Jim Hnnifan 187 LE 182 Hon Eadie 4
When USC and Cat collided, llanifhn was judged the finest end nn the
leld. Ho has led a Cal defensive lino which has not really boon dentec
dl year. Washington, and UCLA passed over them and USC scored on
\ punt run-back.
Eadie is another outstrnding wingmrin. Although ho was out three
i weeks, ho should he at full strength tomorrow. It will he up to Kadie
| and Hill Storum to stop the Boars' end swoops, the play from which most
of Ihcir long noting runs emanate. EVEN.
74 Gerry Perry 227 LT 201 Al Kirkland 21
Perry i.s healthy again which is bad news fin- the Cards. Although he
can ho outfaked and outwilted reasonably easily, still ho is a vicious and
;ure tackier and ho may uncouple a few of Stanford's injured backs before
j the afternoon Is over. Perry is a fine pro-prospect.
Kirkland is still another player who is returning after an injury. Ho
| has played fine hall to load what wo still consider a hotter defensive lino
than that of last year's Rose Bowlers.—EDGE TO CAL.
77 Jim Kotler 210 LG 215 Matt Armitage <11
Kotler and Vince Maiorana (left) have been alternating at this guard
post, possibly the weakest in the Cal defensive wall. Kotler is an ex
! Rambler while Maiorana was knocked out of the starting offensive line-up
| by Tom Dutton, and i.s not quite as effective in the defensive line-up.
Arniitagc has been a real rock in the defensive line, and he's only j
! a sophomore too. Our co-worker Elmore Seeds predicted after the
Michigan game that Armitage will garner for Ail-American honors !
before ho departs from the 1 arm. and he could easily fce right. EDGE '
TO STANFORD.
r>(> Charley Marlucci 200 PG 205 Win Wedge 20
Martucci is a real find. He moved out last year's fine middle guard j
I Steve Glick, although Glick was injured before lie had time to fight back. j
Glick may come back tomorrow io spell the San Francisco-born Martucci.
Wedge is still another of Stanford's five soph line sensations. His j
twin brother, Wes will start for the JV's in today's Brave game. EDGE |
j TO CAL.
7!) Gere Brooks 210 RT 211 John Stanton 15
Cal's crew of crippled tackles arc all coming back for the Big one.
| Brooks, after being out of action for seven weeks is rumored to be ready
i again. George Najarian. another fine tackle, will take over if and when
; Brooks gets carried out.
Stanton is a great prospect from Wyoming. Notre Dame and many
other schools were bidding for his services, hut he came to Stanford.
This was a lucky break for t'ie Cards tor sophomore Stanton has showed
1 more than Boh Latham did last year at the defensive tackle spot. EVEN, i
I
31 Joe Hibbs IS3 BE 202 Bill Storum 51
Hibbs likes to float in slowly with the result that he doesn't give the
passer much trouble, but doesn't let much get by him. This should be
j especially noticnble tomorrow for it will be up to Hibbs to halt Stanford's
j new statue-of-liberty reverse to Mathias.
Storum has looked better this year at defensive end than lie looked
last year in the offensive lino. Against San .lose, he provided one of the
big thrills of the day when he hatted aside three Mockers and tackled i
a Spartan bark for a large loss. EVEN. • ,
14 Don Harris 183 LLB 208 Tod Tanner 20
Harris is versatility plus. Next year, he, Paul Larson, and Bob Brooks i
should form another Terrible Trio of Cal running backs. This year he has j
been shifted to linc-backcr where he has performed as well as could be !
' expected.
Tanner, unlike Harris, is playing the position ho was born for. The
rugged junior stopped into the starting berth and his spectacular tackles
of Hugh MeEllhenny rnd Frank Gilford put the Cardmohilo on the
Hose Bowl road. He's maintained his rugged pace through this season J
too. EDGE TO STANFORD.
54 Matt Hardline 200 RLB 198 Chuck Essegian 56
Hardline i.s the best man on the Cal defensive team. His sparkling
play has won praise from Coach Red Sanders of UCLA, Jess Hill of USC,
I and his own coaching staff.
Essegian is the best man on the Stanford defensive team. His spark- j
ling play won praise from Coach Red Sanders of UCLA and coach Jess
Hill of USC said "Of course. Chuck Esscgian's loss hurt Stanford im
measurably. We all know what a fine line-hacker lie is." EVEN.
23 Sammy Williams 189 LIIB 100 Bob Thompson 6
Williams is a murderous tackier, but he seems to have difficulty guard- '
ing against the short pass. Since Jack Gebci t may throw up to 50 short j
passes, Williams may be in foi a rough afternoon.
Thompson is the best of a porous defensive backficld. lie was a mem
ber of l»st year's magnificent trio of pass defenders. This year, he has
let an occasional pass drift over his bead, but lie's still a fine defender.
l>iok Monteith may take over here with Thompson moving to safety man.
EVEN.
A
21 Dick Leo 17(> LH 181 Joe St. Glrmo 28
Dick Lee would probably bo starting ;>t quarterback tomorrow were it I
; not for the fact that, be is needed in Cai's paper-thin defensive back field, i
; Leo. like Williams has few passes completed over him, but many more j
completed in front of him.
St. Gome is alternately a hope and dispair in the defensive hackficld.
He has lugged hack five intercepted passes for a spectacular 125 yard
total, and is a rough tackier, but ho has also had more than his share ;
of passes completed in his territory. EDGE TO CAL.
12 Paul Larson 175 5M 182 Dave Eldredge C 4
Larson will fill in for Pay Willsey, who will play first string quarterback.
. Larson i.s an excellent punt-returner, a pretty good tacklcr and an un- i
I tried pass-defender.
Eldredge has got off a pair of (he prettiest punt-returns of t'ie year,
and ho is a fair tackier, but Oregon stiil completed too many long passes i
to suit the grandstand quarterbacks. EDGE TO CAL.
★ ★ ★ ★
1 Weight average—Cal 105, Stanford 108. Cal 1-2-5. Cal's defensive line
! hasn't been punctured too badly all year. Opponents' scores have come on !
j passes or after an Olszewski or Mais fumble deep in Bear territory. Cal
j is very vulnerable to the short pass.
Stanford's defense has been a junior version of Cal's. The defensive j
line has been reasonably roek-likc with most enemy scores coming from i
passes or after Card fumbles. Stanford's pass defense should look stronger
tomorrow against Willsey and Williams than against passers like Don
Heinrieh and Rudy Bukich. Dcfcnsc-Cal rates about a touchdown better.
Overall consensus Cal JI-5-8. Cal rates at least a two-touchdown
favorite, but Stanford has a chance if (1) Stanford doesn't fumble and
Cal does, and (2) Jack Gebert can has another 21 for 39-typc day without
the many interceptions which marred last week's performance.
