# Gridiron Picture Bright for 1953
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
No matter how the Indians finish their 1952 oeaion against Cal,
the outlook for 1953 appears extremely bright. A laige majority
of both the offensive and defensive teams will be returning next
season, and it is possible even at this early date to predict a prob
able starting lineup, without considering any frosh or JV graduates.

On the offensive team, all four of*
Stanfordi' top ends will be reti rn
ing. Sam Morley and .'ohn Stein
berg will "probably get the starting
call again next season, backed by
Don Carlson and Biil Sebeidocker.
All four will be seniors, so for the
fifth year in a row the Indians will
be well stocked .with offensive end- j
men.
The tackle spot is the Indians' j
) weake t position, with Vick, Pvle.
Broderiek. and Kirkland all grad- |
j uating. John Stanton and John Lu
; deke arc possibilities for this po.si
j tion.
I With Len Mayrhofer being the |
j only graduate from the guard pot, |
| and with Norm Manoogian rcturn-
I ing for another season, the Indians
j seem especially strong at this spot.
! Phil Wilson. John Koberg. and Paul
Revak will all be back.
The center position al o poses no \
problem for Coach Chuck Taylor.
Firsi-stringer Jerry Goldberg, along \
with sub Al Robertson, will be re
turning.
Despite his injury two weeks ago,
j Rob Garrett will return for what
j should be another great season at '
! quarterback, .lack Gcbcrt. who is j
! currently manning the Indians dur-
I ing Garrett's injury, is oniv a .soph
i omorc.
Several Halfbacks
Although Skip Crist and Chuck
- Brazel are both graduating, Ron
Cook. Bill Rogers, and Jim Stewart
| will be back for another season at
| halfback. Stantord s fullback, Bob
i Ma'hias, has another year of eligi
bility hut presently does not expect.
!o take advantage of it. Jarvis
Watson i.s the Indians' remaining
fullback.
A large number of players will
I return to the defensive team for
; Stanford. With both Ron Eadie and
! Bill Storum graduating, ihe end po
l sition will be Stanford's weakest on
defense, Ron Bn.di and Dick Stccrc
; will probably see most of Ihe action
| there. Perhaps either Carlson or
: Scheidccker will he transferred to [
give depth to that position.
The Indians also find themselves!
j weak at the defensive tackle slot.
; Stanton, Pick Gant, and Barry
Smith remain, and Stanton, already
mentioned for offensive duty, may
: end up going both tvays.
There are a number of defensive j
; guards for 1953. so many that one or
1 two may he switched to tackle. Win I
; Wedge. Matt Armitage, Roy Kricke
berg, and Len Poster- all return
from this year's varsity.
| Stanford's linebackers will prob
| ably be Ted Tanner and Marsh
I Howe, seconded by Tex Long and
| Bill Went worth. Returning half
backs for defensive duty are D'ck j
Monteith, Lorcn Sorenson. and Rol
lo Rannells. Dave Castcllucei, who
. has done some of the punting for
â™¦he Indians, is a likely candidate for
| the safety post. Safetyman Roh j
j Thompson, though having one year j
! of eligibility left, is slated to grad- j
i uate.
Sanders to Return?
In addition to the a foremen- i
1 tioned, Don Sanders, who played a
! fine game at safety in hir, freshman
j year, may well return to the team,
which would boost the Indians' Rose ;
Bowl chances considerably.
) The outstanding player from the j
i frosh of Bob Ghilotti is halfhack
] Jim Truhcr. Although injured a j
good part of this season, Truber is j
j rated a great prospect by coaches.!
i A fast runner, he may be switched j
I to fullback to help balance the In
! dians' attack in 1953.
