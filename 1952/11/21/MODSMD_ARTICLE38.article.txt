# Braves, Ramblers Lock Horns In 10:30 Preliminary
## JV's Out for Their First Win 
### LOU PUJALET 
In a 10:30 a.m. preliminary 10 the 1952 edition of the Ekj Game,
fUaalorr's Braves will take on the California Ramblers on the Me
moiial Coliseum gridiron.
Coach Mai Flward s ]V's will be out in quest el their season's
first win, having dropped the only other two games on their ab-

brevi. ted schedule.
Tin I'ainbkrs will rate the favor
ite. ' rolo, having already played ten
games. Tiiey have won four, lost a
in - nv. ana been held to ties on a
pair ol occasions.
The Braves and Ramblers have
had two common opponents, Treas
ure Island and Ahmed;' NAS. St; n
lo'd 1(» t t > Ti, li-21, and to the MAS,
C il J V s I : tiled to a scoreless
deadlock with the TI Pirates and
.split . pair of 1 antes with the NAS
Helicals. The Ii a m bier s were
thrashed 118-1 i by the flyers in an
early-sea on duel, but came back to
rap the ; m i leven 20-(i five weeks
later.
Coach Zob Chaney's stalwarts
play a brand of ball quite compar
able to their varsity brothers- run,
drive, and smash.
Leading the Cal ground attack are
a pair of tough halfbacks and a
!iard- inaihing fullback. Left half
back Otis Stroud, who weighs in at
181 pound:?, is the Ramblers' biggest
scoring threat. Stroud : pecializes on
off-tackle slants.
Gene Rocker, 170-pound starting
right hnifbnek, is Use team's speed
burner, always it threat around the
ends. The smashes up the middle

are capably handled by Doug Hibbs.
180-pound fullback.
Should the need arise, Cal's aerial
threat, fur from impressive so far
this sea on, i.s directed by quarter
back Doug Stowed, the heaviest of
the starting backs at 197 pounds.
Only one* now face appears on the
Braves' starting eleven since their
hist game. Dick Crepeau will get
the nod at fullback, replacing the
injure! Mike Anderson. Crepeau,
weighing only 170 pounds, has
caught Elward's eye during the past
week of practice. He was a stand
out on defen e in t.ie previous
games this year.
The Braves' ground game will be
centered around halfbacks Bill
Heilhron and Doug Collins. Both
are hard runners and could with a
little help from the forward wall
give the Rambler* a busy day.
Quarterback Dfll Greiner will
draw the passing assignments. With
a little more luck than he has had
so far this season Greiner too could
add plenty to the Braves' offensive
strength.
Loren Sorenson and John Brom
mell, members of the vanity squad,
will play for the Craves tomorrow.
Both will start on defense, but will
be used offensively too.

Coach Zob Chaney's stalwarts
play a brand of ball quite compar
able to their varsity brothers- run,
drive, and smash.
Leading the Cal ground attack are
a pair of tough halfbacks and a
!iard- inaihing fullback. Left half
back Otis Stroud, who weighs in at
181 pound:?, is the Ramblers' biggest
scoring threat. Stroud : pecializes on
off-tackle slants.
Gene Rocker, 170-pound starting
right hnifbnek, is Use team's speed
burner, always it threat around the
ends. The smashes up the middle

are capably handled by Doug Hibbs.

threat, fur from impressive so far
this sea on, i.s directed by quarter
back Doug Stowed, the heaviest of
the starting backs at 197 pounds.
Only one* now face appears on the
Braves' starting eleven since their
hist game. Dick Crepeau will get
the nod at fullback, replacing the
injure! Mike Anderson. Crepeau,
weighing only 170 pounds, has
caught Elward's eye during the past
week of practice. He was a stand
out on defen e in t.ie previous
games this year.
The Braves' ground game will be
centered around halfbacks Bill
Heilhron and Doug Collins. Both
are hard runners and could with a
little help from the forward wall
give the Rambler* a busy day.
Quarterback Dfll Greiner will
draw the passing assignments. With
a little more luck than he has had
so far this season Greiner too could
add plenty to the Braves' offensive
strength.
Loren Sorenson and John Brom
mell, members of the vanity squad,
will play for the Craves tomorrow.
Both will start on defense, but will
be used offensively too.

are capably handled by Doug Hibbs.
180-pound fullback.
Should the need arise, Cal's aerial
threat, fur from impressive so far
this sea on, i.s directed by quarter
back Doug Stowed, the heaviest of
the starting backs at 197 pounds.
Only one* now face appears on the
Braves' starting eleven since their
hist game. Dick Crepeau will get
the nod at fullback, replacing the
injure! Mike Anderson. Crepeau,
weighing only 170 pounds, has
caught Elward's eye during the past
week of practice. He was a stand
out on defen e in t.ie previous
games this year.
The Braves' ground game will be
centered around halfbacks Bill
Heilhron and Doug Collins. Both
are hard runners and could with a
little help from the forward wall
give the Rambler* a busy day.
Quarterback Dfll Greiner will
draw the passing assignments. With
a little more luck than he has had
so far this season Greiner too could
add plenty to the Braves' offensive
strength.
Loren Sorenson and John Brom
mell, members of the vanity squad,
will play for the Craves tomorrow.
Both will start on defense, but will
be used offensively too.
