## 
### WES MARX 
Stan ford has been proving a bet
ter talent producer in present-day
play-ior-pay ranks of football than
the University of California. Pro
fessional team rosters list six former
Cardinal men as compared with two
ex-Golden Beat' men.
I The 19-10 Farm PCC grid champs,
| besides introducing the modern T
. formation, left another impact on

football by sending players II
Gallerneau, No.m Standlee, Frank
ie Albert. Bruno Banducci, Vic
Lindskog, and Chuck Taylor to the
nrofessiornl leagues. Gallerneau,
who half backed for the Chicago
Wears' championship team in 1942;
Lindskog, the Philadelphia Eagles'
all-pro center in 1951; and Taylor,
All - America Conference in 1946,
have retired from the battles, but
Albert, Standlee. and Banducci, all
past the 30-year age mark, are still
donning football cleats for the San
Francisco 49ers. New blood from
the Farm has come in the persons
of '51 giad Boh White, a 49er now.
and Bill McColl and Gary Kerko
rian, the passing-battery of the 1951
PCC titlists, who are with the Chi
cago Bears and the Pittsburgh
Steelers, respectively.
Albert, just another left half in
the 1939 Stanford single wing attack
who was transformed into Mr.
Quarterback of football by Clark
Shaughnessy's introduction of the
modern T in 1940, is in his seventh
year of field generaling with the
Bay City pros. He has slowed up
a bit from 1948 when he set an Ail-
American Conference record of 29
'coring passes and shared the
league's Most Valuable Player
award with Cleveland's Otto Gra
ham.
The year 1948 was a good one for
Banclucci. too, when sports scribes
tagged him Mr. Guard after two
outstanding seasons with the Phila
delphia Eagles. A shoulder separa
tion thereafter has harassed Bruno
with the 49ers. He still takes a turn
at offensive right guard regularly.
Standlee, nicknamed "Chief" by his
teammates who have elected him
their captain the last five years, has
been thought to be sidelined this

season by a summer practice injury
White has proven a pleasant sur
i prise for Coach Buck Shaw.
Received Tryouts
I Former Card backfield men Harry
llugasian, Bob Myers, and Hob
Bryan received tryouts with the Bay
! City team but didn't make the
squad.
McColl and Kerkorian haven't hit
their full stride in the action thus
far. Kerkorian is a reserve quarter
back for the Pittsburgh Steelers.
I McColl, in the midst of George
j Halas' rebuilding of Bear football,
I has been an off-ynd-on starter at
1 offensive end. Bill does not plan to
make a habit of playing pro ball, but
is taking advantage of the cash of
fered while studying for a medical
degree at Northwestern.
The University of California, shut
I off from winning teams and players
of notable stature since 1939, had
their football fortunes reversed
when Pappy Waldorf arrived, at the
campus in 1947. Among Pappy's pro
teges to enter paying football have
been Bob Celeri. with the Dallas
Texans and Jon Baker of the New
York Giants. Celeri had a good
year quarterbacking the New York
Yankees last year. Baker is mark
ing his filth successful year as mid
dle guard in the Giants' stout de
fensive team.
A trio of former Berkeley giid
sters, Johnny Monachino, Pete
Schabarum, and Les Richter, will
enter the leagues after serving Un
cle Sam. Monachino and Scha
barum, playing ball on Navy elev
ens, saw enough action with the
49ers last year to both score twice.
The eager Los Angeles Rams can
hardly wait till Uncle Sam releases
Richter from the Army. The Rams
sent seven players to Dallas to get
the two - time All - American line
backer's draft rights. As player
coach of the Camp Cook Warriors.
Richtef is conditioning himself for
the pro wars.
