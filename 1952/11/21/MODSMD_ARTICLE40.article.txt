# UP Says Cal Will Pass More

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 20 (UP)
There appeared a good chance to
day that the California Bears may
take to the air for the first time in
six years in their battle against
Stanford in the "Big Game" at Ber
keley Saturday.
The known weakened aerial de
fense of the Indians is believed tc

have given Coach Lynn (Pappy)
Waldorf the idea.
That—and the fart that he will
be using Kay Willsev at quarter
back in this game in place of the
injured Billy Mais. Willsev is
acknowledged as a much better
passer than Mais and the few
times the Bears made any effort
at an aerial offensive this year,
Willsey oft-times has been called
in to execute the plays.
Southern California made 258
yards and Washington 258 via the
air lanes in whipping the Indians.
UCLA, San Jose State, and Oregon
averaged 130 yards per game. And
each of the last four Pacific Coast
Conference games, the iocs haw
gained at least 300 yards by land
and air again.-1 th Indians.
"We are going to have to click
awfully well on offense," said
Coach Chuck Taylor of Stanford,
'to keep California from having
the ball to move against us. We
are afraid of the Bears both in
passing and on the ground."
Mostly this year California has
traveled by ground with one of the
moat .successful running attacks in
the-country. But last week against
Washington State the Bears gained
an all-time season high of 135 yards
in the air.
Meanwhile, both Cal and Stan
ford finished off their heavy
scrimmages yesterday. Today they
wound up with I iff lit drills and
tomorrow they will take only ex
ercises for the grand finale of a
season that has been pretty much
of a disappointment to both clubs.
California enters the game as a
two-touchdown favorite and with
a record of six wins and three
losses.
