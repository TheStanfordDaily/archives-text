# Last Big Game For 49 Seniors
## 
### RUSS WILKS 
To use a much over-worked quotation from the quill of Will Shake
speare. "Parting is such sweet sorrow." For whom the parting will be
sweeter will he decided tomorrow at Memorial Stadium as 40 seniors from
Stanford and California end their collegiate careers.
Seventeen men don the regalia of Stanford for the last time, while .'52
seniors from Cal bow out. Eight of the 49 will not suit up for the game

defensive end liol> Hoegh will be on the sidelines as will Cal player.'
Dwight Ely, Steve Glick, Bib Karpe, Kalph Krueger, Ed Michelsen and
probably Gerald Perry.

defensive and vice versa loses ten starters Irom the offense group and live
starters from the defensive group. '
Mathias' Last
Driving through the line for the last time from his fullback posit.on
will be Bob Mathias. Despite only two years ol lootball at Stanford lVla
thias made his presence felt. His 9G yard kick-off return in the 1951 SC.
name and his 61 yard scrimmage run against OSC this year, were only
two of the bright spots in his brief career.
Mathias' baekfield mates Skip Crist and Chuck Bra/el also bow out.
It was Crist who paced the 80 yard scoring drive against UCLA this year
with his 19 yard run and his blocking. It was also Crisf who ran back an
intercepted pass to set up the winning TD against SC in the 27-20 thriller
last season. It was Brazel, who only playing seven minutes of varsity ball
last year, stepped in lor injured hallbacks C rist and C-ook and tuined in a
sparkling performance against San Jose State. In this contest the Burbank
youth scored against the Spartans on an eight yard end run.
Vick Top Blocker
Offensive tackle and Co-Captain Jim Vick puts in a farewell appooranco
tomorrow. Vick a three-year man is considered the best blocker on the
team. It was his block along with Mathias' that sprung Bill Rogers loose
for the 9(J yard touchdown run against OSC.
Pyle, who will not suit up, was also an offensive tackle and a steady
blocker. He, like Vick, also served three years with the varsity.
Middle linemen Len Mayrhofer and Allan llanner also leave the squad.
Mayrhofer, a St. Mary's transfer and an adept cross-blbcker, was a real
delight to Chuck Taylor after a mediocre showing in spring practice. Han
ner, a reserve center, showed up well against San Jose.
Defensive ends Ron Eadie, and Bill Stoinm will make their last collegiate
tackles tomorrow. Eadie, played more than anyone on the Rose Bowl squat I
of '51. However, this year, the rugged defender has been bothered with
injuries. Early this season against Santa Clara, Ron teamed with Bill
Storum to rack-up Duane Louis forcing him to fumble in the end zone
with John Stanton recovering for a Card TD.
Not Rare for Storum
This typo of play wasn't rare for Storum who brought cheers from the
stands as lie played a big part in stopping San Jose's running attack. On
one play the converted halfback warded off a blocker who had fiiteen
pounds on him and nailed the ball carrier. This play lelt Taylor wanting
to know how it was done. Storum's big thrill came in the same game when
he intercepted a Aplanalp pass and rambled 38 yards for a score.
Hoegh was banged up in the SC game. He has played three years of
ball and has been a defensive rock.
Ace line backer Chuck Essegian along with halfbacks Joe St. Gcme,
Boh Thompson and Dave Eldredge also call it a season after 5 o'clock
tomorrow.
Essegian Underrated
Essegian was one of the most underrated players on the PCC Champion
ship team last year. Essegian is everywhere at the right time. He played
an outstanding game against UCLA and was injured in the tussle. Essegian
was declared out for the season, but he bounced back to play in the SC
game. His athletic prowess doesn't end with football as he excells in base
ball. The Los Angeles senior has hit eight home runs out of the sunken
diamond and only 22 have been hit out of there in 23 years.
St. Geme rates the title of "Comeback of the Year" as far as Stanford
players are concerned. In his sophomore year he showed real promise, but
last year he sunk into the reserve depths playing very little ball. When he
made med school last spring he was all for giving up the game, but he was
talked into giving it another try by assistant coach George Lynn. This
time St. Geme made the grade and has been playing a fine brand of ball.
His top games were with OSC and San Jose. In the former St. Geme
intercepted a pass and returned it 50 yards for a TD.
Thompson Leaves
Bob Thompson has improved greatly over last year. ISSI was the first
year of ball for Bob after a two year absence from the gridiron. His alert
ness has made him an asset to the secondary. Thompson also is a top
swimmer.
Defender Dave Eldredge has been injured for most of the season, but he
reached his playing capacity once more against SC. Eldredge along with
St. Geme anil Thompson will be hard to replace in the secondary.
Last but by no means least come tackles John ISroderick, Co-Captain
Al Kirkland and Len Kaprielian who share in the honor of being a Stan
lord football player for the final time. Broderick also hit by the injury
bug finishes out his third year on the varsity. As a sophomore he recovered
a fumble against Santa Clara for a touchdown.
Kirkland Transferred
The best decision that Al Kirkland made as far as Stanford is concerned
was transferring from SC. Playing his first year of ball last year for the
Cards the big guy so impressed his teammates that they elected him Co-
Captain along with Viek. Kirkland made the transition from end to tackle
at Stanford anil has always turned in a fine defensive game.
Len Kaprielian had a tough break in that he had to play behind Kirk
land and John Ludeke, but he saw some action this season and performed
well. Kaprielian an unsung hero of the practice field has given it all he's
got and the results have been favorable.
Potential Ail-Americans Johnny Olszewski and Bob Karpe head one
of the longest lists of seniors ever to leave a Cal squad. The plaudits for
Johnny O. have been heard from the East to the West Coast, but the light
that had been shinning for Ail-American honors has dimmed. Last year
he was the PCC's fifth leading ground getter, but injury kept him out
of three games so there was no chance for the National honor. This year
Johnny O. will lead in the rushing bracket, but once more he will miss
out on Ail-American honors. He started off great, one of his more notable
leats was his 172 yards gained against Oregon, but he was halted by USC.
UCLA and Washington. Fumbles in the USC and UCLA games hurt his
team. There is no denying that the guy is great though and Berkeley in
habitants expect him to bow out in glory tomorrow.
Karpe Didn't Play
Karpe met the same fate that Stanford's Norm Manoogian did this
year. Karpe was injured in pre-season practice and didn't play in a Cal
game all year. Rumors have it that Karpe will return next year. He'll
be eligible, but technically he bows out after the "Big Game."
Numerous baekfield s tarsi play their finale tomorrow including quarter
backs Billy Mais anil Kay Willsey. Don Johnson, who returned a UCLA
kick-off 96 yards lor a TD leaves as does hard running Billy Powell who
racked up three scores against Santa Clara. Turn Kcough who specializes
in punting and extra point kicking joins the throng. One of Keough's best
kicks of the season went G8 yards. Defensive back Dick Lee who was
injured and returned last week against WSC will play his last ball for the
Blue and Gold as will John Peterson, Dean O'llare and John Math.
Among the seven ends leaving are first stringers Hal Ellis, Bob Beal
and Joe Hibbs. Paul Andrew, Bob Beal, Dave Hood and Dick Kern also
saw plenty of action. Â«
Injuries Hit Tackles
Injuries his the tackle spots hard aside from the injured tackles who were
mentioned before are Don Curran, Glenn Gulvin and Vince Maiorana.
Gulvin is the boy who was given up for lost due to leg injuries. He could
hardly walk during the summer, but came back to take over his old job.
Guards Allen Bender, Bill Dutton, Jim Kotler and Don Edmonston
Joave along with centers Leighton Ilahn and Gerry Martin.
Forty-nine players will play college football for the final time tomorrow
afternoon.

Mathias' baekfield mates Skip Crist and Chuck Bra/el also bow out.
It was Crist who paced the 80 yard scoring drive against UCLA this year
with his 19 yard run and his blocking. It was also Crisf who ran back an

sparkling performance against San Jose State. In this contest the Burbank
youth scored against the Spartans on an eight yard end run.
Vick Top Blocker
Offensive tackle and Co-Captain Jim Vick puts in a farewell appooranco
tomorrow. Vick a three-year man is considered the best blocker on the
team. It was his block along with Mathias' that sprung Bill Rogers loose
for the 9(J yard touchdown run against OSC.
Pyle, who will not suit up, was also an offensive tackle and a steady
blocker. He, like Vick, also served three years with the varsity.
Middle linemen Len Mayrhofer and Allan llanner also leave the squad.
Mayrhofer, a St. Mary's transfer and an adept cross-blbcker, was a real
delight to Chuck Taylor after a mediocre showing in spring practice. Han

Defensive ends Ron Eadie, and Bill Stoinm will make their last collegiate
tackles tomorrow. Eadie, played more than anyone on the Rose Bowl squat I
of '51. However, this year, the rugged defender has been bothered with
injuries. Early this season against Santa Clara, Ron teamed with Bill
Storum to rack-up Duane Louis forcing him to fumble in the end zone
with John Stanton recovering for a Card TD.
Not Rare for Storum
This typo of play wasn't rare for Storum who brought cheers from the
stands as lie played a big part in stopping San Jose's running attack. On
one play the converted halfback warded off a blocker who had fiiteen
pounds on him and nailed the ball carrier. This play lelt Taylor wanting
to know how it was done. Storum's big thrill came in the same game when
he intercepted a Aplanalp pass and rambled 38 yards for a score.

ball and has been a defensive rock.
Ace line backer Chuck Essegian along with halfbacks Joe St. Gcme,
Boh Thompson and Dave Eldredge also call it a season after 5 o'clock

Essegian Underrated
Essegian was one of the most underrated players on the PCC Champion
ship team last year. Essegian is everywhere at the right time. He played
an outstanding game against UCLA and was injured in the tussle. Essegian
was declared out for the season, but he bounced back to play in the SC
game. His athletic prowess doesn't end with football as he excells in base
ball. The Los Angeles senior has hit eight home runs out of the sunken
diamond and only 22 have been hit out of there in 23 years.
St. Geme rates the title of "Comeback of the Year" as far as Stanford
players are concerned. In his sophomore year he showed real promise, but
last year he sunk into the reserve depths playing very little ball. When he
made med school last spring he was all for giving up the game, but he was
talked into giving it another try by assistant coach George Lynn. This
time St. Geme made the grade and has been playing a fine brand of ball.
His top games were with OSC and San Jose. In the former St. Geme
intercepted a pass and returned it 50 yards for a TD.
Thompson Leaves
Bob Thompson has improved greatly over last year. ISSI was the first
year of ball for Bob after a two year absence from the gridiron. His alert
ness has made him an asset to the secondary. Thompson also is a top
swimmer.
Defender Dave Eldredge has been injured for most of the season, but he
reached his playing capacity once more against SC. Eldredge along with
St. Geme anil Thompson will be hard to replace in the secondary.
Last but by no means least come tackles John ISroderick, Co-Captain
Al Kirkland and Len Kaprielian who share in the honor of being a Stan
lord football player for the final time. Broderick also hit by the injury
bug finishes out his third year on the varsity. As a sophomore he recovered
a fumble against Santa Clara for a touchdown.
Kirkland Transferred
The best decision that Al Kirkland made as far as Stanford is concerned
was transferring from SC. Playing his first year of ball last year for the
Cards the big guy so impressed his teammates that they elected him Co-
Captain along with Viek. Kirkland made the transition from end to tackle
at Stanford anil has always turned in a fine defensive game.
Len Kaprielian had a tough break in that he had to play behind Kirk
land and John Ludeke, but he saw some action this season and performed
well. Kaprielian an unsung hero of the practice field has given it all he's
got and the results have been favorable.
Potential Ail-Americans Johnny Olszewski and Bob Karpe head one
of the longest lists of seniors ever to leave a Cal squad. The plaudits for
Johnny O. have been heard from the East to the West Coast, but the light

he was the PCC's fifth leading ground getter, but injury kept him out

Bob Thompson has improved greatly over last year. ISSI was the first
year of ball for Bob after a two year absence from the gridiron. His alert
ness has made him an asset to the secondary. Thompson also is a top
swimmer.
Defender Dave Eldredge has been injured for most of the season, but he
reached his playing capacity once more against SC. Eldredge along with
St. Geme anil Thompson will be hard to replace in the secondary.
Last but by no means least come tackles John ISroderick, Co-Captain
Al Kirkland and Len Kaprielian who share in the honor of being a Stan
lord football player for the final time. Broderick also hit by the injury
bug finishes out his third year on the varsity. As a sophomore he recovered
a fumble against Santa Clara for a touchdown.
Kirkland Transferred
The best decision that Al Kirkland made as far as Stanford is concerned
was transferring from SC. Playing his first year of ball last year for the
Cards the big guy so impressed his teammates that they elected him Co-
Captain along with Viek. Kirkland made the transition from end to tackle
at Stanford anil has always turned in a fine defensive game.
Len Kaprielian had a tough break in that he had to play behind Kirk
land and John Ludeke, but he saw some action this season and performed
well. Kaprielian an unsung hero of the practice field has given it all he's
got and the results have been favorable.
Potential Ail-Americans Johnny Olszewski and Bob Karpe head one

he was the PCC's fifth leading ground getter, but injury kept him out
of three games so there was no chance for the National honor. This year
Johnny O. will lead in the rushing bracket, but once more he will miss
out on Ail-American honors. He started off great, one of his more notable

It was Crist who paced the 80 yard scoring drive against UCLA this year
with his 19 yard run and his blocking. It was also Crisf who ran back an

last season. It was Brazel, who only playing seven minutes of varsity ball
last year, stepped in lor injured hallbacks C rist and C-ook and tuined in a
sparkling performance against San Jose State. In this contest the Burbank
youth scored against the Spartans on an eight yard end run.
Vick Top Blocker
Offensive tackle and Co-Captain Jim Vick puts in a farewell appooranco
tomorrow. Vick a three-year man is considered the best blocker on the
team. It was his block along with Mathias' that sprung Bill Rogers loose
for the 9(J yard touchdown run against OSC.
Pyle, who will not suit up, was also an offensive tackle and a steady
blocker. He, like Vick, also served three years with the varsity.
Middle linemen Len Mayrhofer and Allan llanner also leave the squad.
Mayrhofer, a St. Mary's transfer and an adept cross-blbcker, was a real
delight to Chuck Taylor after a mediocre showing in spring practice. Han
ner, a reserve center, showed up well against San Jose.
Defensive ends Ron Eadie, and Bill Stoinm will make their last collegiate
tackles tomorrow. Eadie, played more than anyone on the Rose Bowl squat I
of '51. However, this year, the rugged defender has been bothered with
injuries. Early this season against Santa Clara, Ron teamed with Bill
Storum to rack-up Duane Louis forcing him to fumble in the end zone
with John Stanton recovering for a Card TD.
Not Rare for Storum
This typo of play wasn't rare for Storum who brought cheers from the
stands as lie played a big part in stopping San Jose's running attack. On
one play the converted halfback warded off a blocker who had fiiteen
pounds on him and nailed the ball carrier. This play lelt Taylor wanting
to know how it was done. Storum's big thrill came in the same game when
he intercepted a Aplanalp pass and rambled 38 yards for a score.
Hoegh was banged up in the SC game. He has played three years of
ball and has been a defensive rock.
Ace line backer Chuck Essegian along with halfbacks Joe St. Gcme,
Boh Thompson and Dave Eldredge also call it a season after 5 o'clock
tomorrow.
Essegian Underrated
Essegian was one of the most underrated players on the PCC Champion
ship team last year. Essegian is everywhere at the right time. He played
an outstanding game against UCLA and was injured in the tussle. Essegian
was declared out for the season, but he bounced back to play in the SC
game. His athletic prowess doesn't end with football as he excells in base
ball. The Los Angeles senior has hit eight home runs out of the sunken
diamond and only 22 have been hit out of there in 23 years.
St. Geme rates the title of "Comeback of the Year" as far as Stanford
players are concerned. In his sophomore year he showed real promise, but
last year he sunk into the reserve depths playing very little ball. When he
made med school last spring he was all for giving up the game, but he was
talked into giving it another try by assistant coach George Lynn. This

injuries. Early this season against Santa Clara, Ron teamed with Bill
Storum to rack-up Duane Louis forcing him to fumble in the end zone
with John Stanton recovering for a Card TD.
Not Rare for Storum
This typo of play wasn't rare for Storum who brought cheers from the
stands as lie played a big part in stopping San Jose's running attack. On
one play the converted halfback warded off a blocker who had fiiteen
pounds on him and nailed the ball carrier. This play lelt Taylor wanting

ball and has been a defensive rock.
Ace line backer Chuck Essegian along with halfbacks Joe St. Gcme,
Boh Thompson and Dave Eldredge also call it a season after 5 o'clock

Essegian Underrated
Essegian was one of the most underrated players on the PCC Champion
ship team last year. Essegian is everywhere at the right time. He played
an outstanding game against UCLA and was injured in the tussle. Essegian
was declared out for the season, but he bounced back to play in the SC
game. His athletic prowess doesn't end with football as he excells in base
ball. The Los Angeles senior has hit eight home runs out of the sunken
diamond and only 22 have been hit out of there in 23 years.
St. Geme rates the title of "Comeback of the Year" as far as Stanford
players are concerned. In his sophomore year he showed real promise, but
last year he sunk into the reserve depths playing very little ball. When he
made med school last spring he was all for giving up the game, but he was
talked into giving it another try by assistant coach George Lynn. This
time St. Geme made the grade and has been playing a fine brand of ball.
His top games were with OSC and San Jose. In the former St. Geme
intercepted a pass and returned it 50 yards for a TD.
Thompson Leaves
Bob Thompson has improved greatly over last year. ISSI was the first
year of ball for Bob after a two year absence from the gridiron. His alert
ness has made him an asset to the secondary. Thompson also is a top
swimmer.
Defender Dave Eldredge has been injured for most of the season, but he
reached his playing capacity once more against SC. Eldredge along with
St. Geme anil Thompson will be hard to replace in the secondary.
Last but by no means least come tackles John ISroderick, Co-Captain
Al Kirkland and Len Kaprielian who share in the honor of being a Stan
lord football player for the final time. Broderick also hit by the injury
bug finishes out his third year on the varsity. As a sophomore he recovered
a fumble against Santa Clara for a touchdown.
Kirkland Transferred
The best decision that Al Kirkland made as far as Stanford is concerned
was transferring from SC. Playing his first year of ball last year for the
Cards the big guy so impressed his teammates that they elected him Co-
Captain along with Viek. Kirkland made the transition from end to tackle
at Stanford anil has always turned in a fine defensive game.
Len Kaprielian had a tough break in that he had to play behind Kirk
land and John Ludeke, but he saw some action this season and performed
well. Kaprielian an unsung hero of the practice field has given it all he's
got and the results have been favorable.
Potential Ail-Americans Johnny Olszewski and Bob Karpe head one
of the longest lists of seniors ever to leave a Cal squad. The plaudits for
Johnny O. have been heard from the East to the West Coast, but the light

he was the PCC's fifth leading ground getter, but injury kept him out
of three games so there was no chance for the National honor. This year
Johnny O. will lead in the rushing bracket, but once more he will miss
out on Ail-American honors. He started off great, one of his more notable

game all year. Rumors have it that Karpe will return next year. He'll
be eligible, but technically he bows out after the "Big Game."

It was Crist who paced the 80 yard scoring drive against UCLA this year
with his 19 yard run and his blocking. It was also Crisf who ran back an

last season. It was Brazel, who only playing seven minutes of varsity ball
last year, stepped in lor injured hallbacks C rist and C-ook and tuined in a
sparkling performance against San Jose State. In this contest the Burbank
youth scored against the Spartans on an eight yard end run.
Vick Top Blocker
Offensive tackle and Co-Captain Jim Vick puts in a farewell appooranco
tomorrow. Vick a three-year man is considered the best blocker on the
team. It was his block along with Mathias' that sprung Bill Rogers loose

blocker. He, like Vick, also served three years with the varsity.
Middle linemen Len Mayrhofer and Allan llanner also leave the squad.

defensive and vice versa loses ten starters Irom the offense group and live
starters from the defensive group. '
Mathias' Last
Driving through the line for the last time from his fullback posit.on
will be Bob Mathias. Despite only two years ol lootball at Stanford lVla
thias made his presence felt. His 9G yard kick-off return in the 1951 SC.
name and his 61 yard scrimmage run against OSC this year, were only
two of the bright spots in his brief career.
Mathias' baekfield mates Skip Crist and Chuck Bra/el also bow out.
It was Crist who paced the 80 yard scoring drive against UCLA this year
with his 19 yard run and his blocking. It was also Crisf who ran back an
intercepted pass to set up the winning TD against SC in the 27-20 thriller
last season. It was Brazel, who only playing seven minutes of varsity ball
last year, stepped in lor injured hallbacks C rist and C-ook and tuined in a
sparkling performance against San Jose State. In this contest the Burbank
youth scored against the Spartans on an eight yard end run.
Vick Top Blocker
Offensive tackle and Co-Captain Jim Vick puts in a farewell appooranco
tomorrow. Vick a three-year man is considered the best blocker on the
team. It was his block along with Mathias' that sprung Bill Rogers loose
for the 9(J yard touchdown run against OSC.
Pyle, who will not suit up, was also an offensive tackle and a steady
blocker. He, like Vick, also served three years with the varsity.
Middle linemen Len Mayrhofer and Allan llanner also leave the squad.
Mayrhofer, a St. Mary's transfer and an adept cross-blbcker, was a real
delight to Chuck Taylor after a mediocre showing in spring practice. Han
ner, a reserve center, showed up well against San Jose.
Defensive ends Ron Eadie, and Bill Stoinm will make their last collegiate
tackles tomorrow. Eadie, played more than anyone on the Rose Bowl squat I
of '51. However, this year, the rugged defender has been bothered with
injuries. Early this season against Santa Clara, Ron teamed with Bill
Storum to rack-up Duane Louis forcing him to fumble in the end zone
with John Stanton recovering for a Card TD.
Not Rare for Storum
This typo of play wasn't rare for Storum who brought cheers from the
stands as lie played a big part in stopping San Jose's running attack. On
one play the converted halfback warded off a blocker who had fiiteen
pounds on him and nailed the ball carrier. This play lelt Taylor wanting
to know how it was done. Storum's big thrill came in the same game when
he intercepted a Aplanalp pass and rambled 38 yards for a score.
Hoegh was banged up in the SC game. He has played three years of
ball and has been a defensive rock.
Ace line backer Chuck Essegian along with halfbacks Joe St. Gcme,
Boh Thompson and Dave Eldredge also call it a season after 5 o'clock
tomorrow.
Essegian Underrated
Essegian was one of the most underrated players on the PCC Champion
ship team last year. Essegian is everywhere at the right time. He played
an outstanding game against UCLA and was injured in the tussle. Essegian
was declared out for the season, but he bounced back to play in the SC
game. His athletic prowess doesn't end with football as he excells in base
ball. The Los Angeles senior has hit eight home runs out of the sunken
diamond and only 22 have been hit out of there in 23 years.
St. Geme rates the title of "Comeback of the Year" as far as Stanford
players are concerned. In his sophomore year he showed real promise, but
last year he sunk into the reserve depths playing very little ball. When he
made med school last spring he was all for giving up the game, but he was
talked into giving it another try by assistant coach George Lynn. This
time St. Geme made the grade and has been playing a fine brand of ball.
His top games were with OSC and San Jose. In the former St. Geme
intercepted a pass and returned it 50 yards for a TD.
Thompson Leaves
Bob Thompson has improved greatly over last year. ISSI was the first
year of ball for Bob after a two year absence from the gridiron. His alert
ness has made him an asset to the secondary. Thompson also is a top
swimmer.
Defender Dave Eldredge has been injured for most of the season, but he
reached his playing capacity once more against SC. Eldredge along with
St. Geme anil Thompson will be hard to replace in the secondary.
Last but by no means least come tackles John ISroderick, Co-Captain
Al Kirkland and Len Kaprielian who share in the honor of being a Stan
lord football player for the final time. Broderick also hit by the injury
bug finishes out his third year on the varsity. As a sophomore he recovered
a fumble against Santa Clara for a touchdown.
Kirkland Transferred
The best decision that Al Kirkland made as far as Stanford is concerned
was transferring from SC. Playing his first year of ball last year for the
Cards the big guy so impressed his teammates that they elected him Co-
Captain along with Viek. Kirkland made the transition from end to tackle
at Stanford anil has always turned in a fine defensive game.
Len Kaprielian had a tough break in that he had to play behind Kirk
land and John Ludeke, but he saw some action this season and performed
well. Kaprielian an unsung hero of the practice field has given it all he's
got and the results have been favorable.
Potential Ail-Americans Johnny Olszewski and Bob Karpe head one
of the longest lists of seniors ever to leave a Cal squad. The plaudits for
Johnny O. have been heard from the East to the West Coast, but the light
that had been shinning for Ail-American honors has dimmed. Last year
he was the PCC's fifth leading ground getter, but injury kept him out
of three games so there was no chance for the National honor. This year
Johnny O. will lead in the rushing bracket, but once more he will miss
out on Ail-American honors. He started off great, one of his more notable
leats was his 172 yards gained against Oregon, but he was halted by USC.
UCLA and Washington. Fumbles in the USC and UCLA games hurt his
team. There is no denying that the guy is great though and Berkeley in
habitants expect him to bow out in glory tomorrow.
Karpe Didn't Play
Karpe met the same fate that Stanford's Norm Manoogian did this
year. Karpe was injured in pre-season practice and didn't play in a Cal
game all year. Rumors have it that Karpe will return next year. He'll
be eligible, but technically he bows out after the "Big Game."
Numerous baekfield s tarsi play their finale tomorrow including quarter
backs Billy Mais anil Kay Willsey. Don Johnson, who returned a UCLA
kick-off 96 yards lor a TD leaves as does hard running Billy Powell who
racked up three scores against Santa Clara. Turn Kcough who specializes
in punting and extra point kicking joins the throng. One of Keough's best
kicks of the season went G8 yards. Defensive back Dick Lee who was
injured and returned last week against WSC will play his last ball for the
Blue and Gold as will John Peterson, Dean O'llare and John Math.
Among the seven ends leaving are first stringers Hal Ellis, Bob Beal
and Joe Hibbs. Paul Andrew, Bob Beal, Dave Hood and Dick Kern also
saw plenty of action. Â«
Injuries Hit Tackles
Injuries his the tackle spots hard aside from the injured tackles who were
mentioned before are Don Curran, Glenn Gulvin and Vince Maiorana.
Gulvin is the boy who was given up for lost due to leg injuries. He could
hardly walk during the summer, but came back to take over his old job.
Guards Allen Bender, Bill Dutton, Jim Kotler and Don Edmonston
Joave along with centers Leighton Ilahn and Gerry Martin.
Forty-nine players will play college football for the final time tomorrow
afternoon.
