# Two Great Linemen Out of Tilt

### DICK MALTZMAN 
Long before the student bodies of
either school had returned'for their
year of book-bending, booze-guz
zling, and assorted hooprahs over
their respective football teams, the
Jniver ities of California (at Ber
keley) and Stanford (at Palo AKo) 1
wore ea h struck a blow that could
very well account for the confer

instead of Strawbeiry Canyon to

For it was a sad day indeed that
Stanford's Norm Mr.noo ian, called
by Chuck Taylor '"the best offensive
guard in the nation." was carried off
the Cards' practice field with a
wrenched kr.;.e in Uie early days
of fall practice.
And while the Stanfords mourned
their loss, the men of Cal were
smitten by equal misfortune—two
year All-Coast tackle Bob Karpe,
Pappy Waldorf'*-' co -
All - American honors along with
Johnny Ob.zewsl.i, was cai'j ied 0..
Edwards practice field with a
wrenched knee.
Left guard Norm a
200-11). senior, was great as a de
fensive player on the '50 M|uad
that moved the PCC championship
Bears to a 7-7 tie.
Then, transferred to the offensive
squad, the rugged Armenian led the
plays that eventually led the Cards
to their first Con t crown sinice
1940 and earned himself All-Coast
honors and All-American mention.
Karpe, (j-ft. 2-in. senior weigh

ing in at a mere 225 lbs., was an
irreplaceable loss that a California
which was supposed to have all the
horses couldn't replace.
The big Bakersfield High boy was
the man needed to open those need
ed holes against UCLA, USC, and
Washington. He is rated by Bear
line coach Herm Meister as "one
of the outstanding tackles" that he
has ever coached. A block of gran
ite that moves down field like a
running guard can be mighty
bandy, even with a pack of ''ground
hogs" running in the baekfield.
And as for Stanford, the big
Southern C'alifornian was badly
needed as injuries spread the
Stanford line thinner and thinner
as the year roiled on.
But what of next year? Both
Karpe and Manoogian have saved
their eligibility, if they make use

of it. Who knows if might be Karpe
again t Manoogian in next year's
-1 ii; Game.
