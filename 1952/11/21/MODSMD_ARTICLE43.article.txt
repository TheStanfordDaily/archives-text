# Sauer Is NL MVP
## 
### 
Hank Sauer, a player who was
considered washed up four years
ago, was named the' National
League's most valuable player for
1952 yesterday by. the Baseball
Writers' Assoication of America.
The selection of the 33-year-old
Chicago Cub slugger came as a
surprise to many, as Sauer
slumped badly in the last month
of the season after a brilliant
start.
Close behind Hank for the award
were two pitchers, 28-game winner
Robin Roberts of the Philadelphia
Phillies, and Joe Black, 15 - game
winning relief star of the Brooklyn
Dodgers.
Sauer polled 22fi votes out of a
possible 336, Roberts had 211, and
Black 208.
Although he got but 1G hits the
last month of the season, Hank, who
was considered through with the
Cincinnati Reds, wound up in a tie
for home run honors with Ralph
Kiner of Pittsburgh with 37, batted
in 121 runs, high for the loop, and
batted .270.
The (i-4, 200-lb. Sauer started
off the past season brilliantly, and
the main reason the Chicago entry
showed so much early foot in the
race. By June, Hank was bitting
nearly 400, had nearly 20 homer*,
and had knocked in dozens of
runs.
Sauer spent a number of years in
the minors, where he was a home
run champ, before getting a chance
with Cincinnati in 1947. Alter two
mediocre seasons the Reds dumped
him and Frank Baumholtz to' "the
Cubs for "Peanuts" Lowrey and
Frank Hiller. 'i"he Cubs certainly
seem to have gotten the best of the
deal, as Baumholtz was runner-up
to Stan Mui ial in batting this season
while Lowry and Ililler have
moved on from tlie Redlegs.—P. B.
