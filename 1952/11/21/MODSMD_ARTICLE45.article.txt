No IJ'.» Profit
Many fans suffer under (he delu
sion that Stanford makes 'a great
deal of profit on the lelevbing o!'
this game. Actually, though, only
$375 will go to the University for the
game. An NCAA rule introduced
this year says that the money fbat
goes to the universities for televis
ing their games must not exceed
the cost the stations charge for the
time. KRON charges $750 for the
three hours' time, so that amount is
being .split between the two schools.
The profit on the Stanford-Miehi
i, ,
gan game was somewhat more, be
cause the money was based on the

televising time on all of the TV tta-'
I tions aero s the nation.
Announcers have not yet been
i named for the game, which will be
| broadcast on NBC radio stations.
