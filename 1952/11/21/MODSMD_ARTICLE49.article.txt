Question to Be Derided
On paper the. Bears have the game
sewed up, but in this Big Game, as
in any football game, a fumble, a
dropped pass, a penalty, or a friend
ly dip of Lady Luck's wand can
make the difference.

of whether the Axe comes home or

On paper the. Bears have the game
sewed up, but in this Big Game, as
in any football game, a fumble, a
dropped pass, a penalty, or a friend
ly dip of Lady Luck's wand can
make the difference.
And 80,000 people, fully aware of j
this and fully aware that this is the
Big Game where uprets are the rule, !
will make their way to Berkeley

of whether the Axe comes home or
the Bears retain it is one that two j

ford defensive wall, held together ;
with tape and gauze, may not be |
able to withstand such power.
There is some solace in the fact j
that the Bears don't have a good j
passing game, and the Indian®, who j
are notoriously weak in defense of {
such a game, can h'-fath" hit c > c - !
irr realizing that Mr. Willsey, the
Bear chucker, is not a Don Hein
rich, Paul C'ameroi, or nriv of the j
others who have consistently both- j
urea the Indian defenders on many !
a Saturday afternoon. He c;m be
dangerous, though, and Willsey is
one quarterback who runs well and
likes to do so.
So that's the ftory. It looks like s
Stanford's passing vs. California's
running. And the question is, who
can stop whom with the least yards?
In practice this week the Card? I
have stressed t'ming and sharpen
ing up of familiar plays with only j
a few new surprises installed for |
brother Bear, the theory being that I
the old ones will work if there is
the blocking. •
Question to Be Derided
On paper the. Bears have the game
sewed up, but in this Big Game, as
in any football game, a fumble, a
dropped pass, a penalty, or a friend
ly dip of Lady Luck's wand can
make the difference.
And 80,000 people, fully aware of j
this and fully aware that this is the
Big Game where uprets are the rule, !
will make their way to Berkeley
toomrrow knowing that the question
of whether the Axe comes home or
the Bears retain it is one that two j
football teams arc going to argue i
about, on the floor of Memorial Sta
dium at 1:30.
And they know the answer is one
not to be found in past perform
ances, but rather one that will be j
fouiht out to a definite answer by ;
4:30.
