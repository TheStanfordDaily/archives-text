# A 						Close Shave Raiders 'Blocked'
## 
### 
Enema's barber crew experiment
ed late Wednesday night on its first
"customers" â€”three Cal frosh.
The invaders, discovered by
freshmen John Booth and Kay Sil
liman while watching the bonfire
construction from bushes near the
boathouse, were quickly escorted to
the Encina lobby by Steve Jones.
Tom McKenna, John Sevier, and
Harry Sykes shortly after midnight.
Sevier, Bill McClure, and Jim
Kelly handled the clipping chores.
One Cal man was given a block
"S" cut in the top of his head. As
an added touch, the bald "S" was
rubbed with shoe polish.
Another was left with only an
"S"-shaped tuft on top of his head.
The third man was shaved rlean ex
cept for two Mohawk - like strips
along the top of his head.
After the beauty treatment, the
three were set free to hitchhike back
to the Cal campus.
