BIG GAME HIGH SPOTS—(Left) Halfback Ron Cook (57) was stopped in the California second
ary by Sam Williams (23) as he broke loose around right end. John Broderick (46) trails the play.
(Center) Bob Mathias leaps high but to no avail as a Jack Gebcrt pass slips off his fingers early
in the game. Don Harris (14) rushes up to stop Mathias if necessary. Mathias ended his Stanford
grid days with a fine performance. (Right) Johnny Olszewski is trailed by what looks like the
entire Stanford team as he makes one of his frequent trips through the Indian defense. "Johnny
O" set a new Conference record for total yards gained on the ground in a three-year collegiate
career when he picked up four yards in the final 30 seconds of play. Coach Chuck Taylor said his
troops played the game to the hilt, and that he was satisfied.—Daily photos by Glenn Erickson
