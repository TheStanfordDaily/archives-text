# 'Playing Game to Hilt' Not Enough to Stop Cal
## 
### LARRY CAHN Sports Editor, Stanford Daily 
Stanford seniors didn't soe the Axe come home. But this clas;
of '53 and the classes of '54, '55, and '56 and thousands of alum
saw HiPir Stanford varsity wage a do or die, never call it qui'.o
battle against a superior California eleven Saturday only to bow
0-26.
And of the Stanford effort Coach Chuck Taylor said, "Tiny

played the game to (lie hilt and I
am more than satisfied with the
team's performance."
It was only after playing the
Pears to a standstill in the first 28
minutes of play and looking them
selves as the two-touchdown fa.
\ orites, that the Cards fell victim
to that last-minutes first-half jinx
and tin* inevitable touchdown that
goes with it.
Tliis time it. was a 38-yard pass
play from California quarterback
Ray Willscy Bob Ileal over safety
man Dave Eloredge,
Cal had been setting up. that play
the entire first half hy sending Beal
downficld to knoek down El dredge
011 all running patterns. On the TD
the pattern was the same: Beal went
down, faked a block on Eldredge,
and cut behind him to receive be
fore the Indian could recover and
make more than a futile gesture at
protection. QB Willscy was u."ung
his head.
Eldredge expressed a desire in
the dressing room at half-time to
have a chance to make that one
up to his teammates. Fut he
couldn't, for Dave broke his foot
early in the third period when
he brought down Johnny Olszew
ski deep in Stanford territory, but
after a whistle had made his effort
all for naught.
The first half was surprisingly
even. The Bears had 199 yards to
tal while the Indian.4 amassed .172,
but Cal had the seven points.
The second half yas a different
story, with the California backfield
of Olszewski, Bill Powell, Don
Johnson, and Willscy, one of the
finest running quartets ever to grace
a Bear gridiron, wearing down the
tape and gauze Stanford line to
grind out. 234 more yards and three
TD's, /mr on a pass infcrcqption, to
wind up with a total 416 yards on
rushing and passing for the day,
while the Cards could only add 77
on the ground and only a few more
in the air to end up with 233 total.
The Cal attaek was spearheaded
by Johnny "O." who looked every
hit as fine as I'hl enthusiasts have
been shouting as he broke the
three-year record for yards on the
ground held liy Hugh iYlcKllipnny,
lately of Washington, hy piling up
a total 2,.">04 vards in his three
Cal years, five more than hustling
Hugh could muster. Put as John
ny O said in the Pear dressing
room, "That Stanford line was one
of the hardest we have run against
;ill year. Tliev hit hard and played
good ball."
And it was Taylor who at the op
posite end of 11 if Stadium in a
steamy, quiet Card diessiug room
was praising the Cal backfield as
top'; and the one thing that beat the
Cards.
tf there w.v; a turning point in
llii.; battle, which seemed so nip and
tuck when the Cards were not sup
posed l.f) be even in it, it Was a bad
e;i 11 by Stanford quarterback Jack
(iobcrt early in the tlnrd period.
The Cards were rolling after taking
a C;i| punt on their 1(1 and moved
to the Bear 31. where it was fourth
and one. (Johort called for a quick
button* hook flat pa: s to Morley, but
overthrew. Cal took fiver and
marched lo their .second TU, and the
Cards could not conic back,
It seems good Monday morning
quartcrbacking to wonder why
Jack didn't call Mathias' or Cook's
or Watson's number up the mid
dle when* Ihc Card hacks were
booming so well. Put if it had

worked there would he praise for
(ifhert's smart rail to cross up th<-
defense. It didn't work so there is
conjecture.
But in defeat the Indian back
wore superb. Next to Olsrewr.k
Mathias was the finest bark on th
field and there were many gm.
ones. Robert picked up 92
in 19 carries, not much It: • th w
Olszewski's 122 yards in 25 car

appearance for Stanford.
And Ron Cook averaged V. 1 jc
carry on seven carries, and .Tar-.-j
Watson, who has seen little arti •
had a 5.7 average on nine can i
And those Small men with the
Hearts, Jimmy Stewart an 1 Churl
Braze!, who go over men who h; .
a 50-pound weight advantage n
stead of around them, deserve jnu
praise and Taylor gave ii to tin
with his expression of "Kids iik
that make vou proud."
And that offensive line ,vlii i
was opening the holes for the
backs were moving the Bears as
if they were non-existent. Phil
Wilson was outstanding, as \ya .
Jim Vick in his last game, and
Paul Itcvak, a sophomore ;>uh fill
ing in, anil all the rest.
The defensive line, which held s.
| well so often only to be finally beat-
I en down, deserves credit, especially
Ron Eadie, Chuck Essegian, Barry
Smith, and Ted Tanner.
In the Stanford dressing room the
seniors knew they had failed, but
not without a fine try, and the jun
iors were aware and made it known
among themselves that they only
had one more year in which to beat
Cal, and Chuck Taylor, who ended
his second year as Card mentor with
a five-and-five record, was already
looking ahead to next year.
"We should have a good ball club
in 1953. We lose few men, though
the ones we do will hurt—and as foe
: California? It isn't every day that
they come up with a backfield like
this year's. We should have a good
year if we are not hard struck again
by injuries. And can we beat Cali
fornia in '53? That's a tough one
to answer, but I'll go on record as
saying that we should win our
opener against Santa Clara."

all for naught.
The first half was surprisingly
even. The Bears had 199 yards to

of Olszewski, Bill Powell, Don

tape and gauze Stanford line to

0-26.
And of the Stanford effort Coach Chuck Taylor said, "Tiny

played the game to (lie hilt and I
am more than satisfied with the
team's performance."
It was only after playing the
Pears to a standstill in the first 28
minutes of play and looking them
selves as the two-touchdown fa.
\ orites, that the Cards fell victim
to that last-minutes first-half jinx
and tin* inevitable touchdown that
goes with it.
Tliis time it. was a 38-yard pass
play from California quarterback
Ray Willscy Bob Ileal over safety
man Dave Eloredge,
Cal had been setting up. that play
the entire first half hy sending Beal
downficld to knoek down El dredge
011 all running patterns. On the TD
the pattern was the same: Beal went
down, faked a block on Eldredge,
and cut behind him to receive be
fore the Indian could recover and
make more than a futile gesture at
protection. QB Willscy was u."ung
his head.
Eldredge expressed a desire in
the dressing room at half-time to
have a chance to make that one
up to his teammates. Fut he
couldn't, for Dave broke his foot
early in the third period when
he brought down Johnny Olszew
ski deep in Stanford territory, but
after a whistle had made his effort
all for naught.
The first half was surprisingly
even. The Bears had 199 yards to
tal while the Indian.4 amassed .172,
but Cal had the seven points.
The second half yas a different
story, with the California backfield
of Olszewski, Bill Powell, Don
Johnson, and Willscy, one of the
finest running quartets ever to grace
a Bear gridiron, wearing down the
tape and gauze Stanford line to
grind out. 234 more yards and three
TD's, /mr on a pass infcrcqption, to
wind up with a total 416 yards on
rushing and passing for the day,
while the Cards could only add 77
on the ground and only a few more
in the air to end up with 233 total.
The Cal attaek was spearheaded
by Johnny "O." who looked every
hit as fine as I'hl enthusiasts have
been shouting as he broke the
three-year record for yards on the
ground held liy Hugh iYlcKllipnny,
lately of Washington, hy piling up
a total 2,.">04 vards in his three
Cal years, five more than hustling
Hugh could muster. Put as John
ny O said in the Pear dressing
room, "That Stanford line was one
of the hardest we have run against
;ill year. Tliev hit hard and played
good ball."
And it was Taylor who at the op
posite end of 11 if Stadium in a
steamy, quiet Card diessiug room
was praising the Cal backfield as
top'; and the one thing that beat the
Cards.
tf there w.v; a turning point in

a C;i| punt on their 1(1 and moved
to the Bear 31. where it was fourth

It seems good Monday morning

booming so well. Put if it had

worked there would he praise for
(ifhert's smart rail to cross up th<-
defense. It didn't work so there is
conjecture.

"We should have a good ball club

year if we are not hard struck again
by injuries. And can we beat Cali

to answer, but I'll go on record as
saying that we should win our
opener against Santa Clara."

booming so well. Put if it had

worked there would he praise for
(ifhert's smart rail to cross up th<-
defense. It didn't work so there is
conjecture.
But in defeat the Indian back
wore superb. Next to Olsrewr.k
Mathias was the finest bark on th
field and there were many gm.
ones. Robert picked up 92
in 19 carries, not much It: • th w

battle against a superior California eleven Saturday only to bow
0-26.
And of the Stanford effort Coach Chuck Taylor said, "Tiny

played the game to (lie hilt and I
am more than satisfied with the
team's performance."
It was only after playing the
Pears to a standstill in the first 28
minutes of play and looking them
selves as the two-touchdown fa.
\ orites, that the Cards fell victim
to that last-minutes first-half jinx
and tin* inevitable touchdown that
goes with it.
Tliis time it. was a 38-yard pass
play from California quarterback
Ray Willscy Bob Ileal over safety
man Dave Eloredge,
Cal had been setting up. that play
the entire first half hy sending Beal
downficld to knoek down El dredge
011 all running patterns. On the TD
the pattern was the same: Beal went
down, faked a block on Eldredge,
and cut behind him to receive be
fore the Indian could recover and
make more than a futile gesture at
protection. QB Willscy was u."ung
his head.
Eldredge expressed a desire in
the dressing room at half-time to
have a chance to make that one
up to his teammates. Fut he
couldn't, for Dave broke his foot
early in the third period when
he brought down Johnny Olszew
ski deep in Stanford territory, but
after a whistle had made his effort
all for naught.
The first half was surprisingly
even. The Bears had 199 yards to
tal while the Indian.4 amassed .172,
but Cal had the seven points.
The second half yas a different
story, with the California backfield
of Olszewski, Bill Powell, Don
Johnson, and Willscy, one of the
finest running quartets ever to grace
a Bear gridiron, wearing down the
tape and gauze Stanford line to
grind out. 234 more yards and three
TD's, /mr on a pass infcrcqption, to
wind up with a total 416 yards on
rushing and passing for the day,
while the Cards could only add 77
on the ground and only a few more
in the air to end up with 233 total.
The Cal attaek was spearheaded
by Johnny "O." who looked every
hit as fine as I'hl enthusiasts have
been shouting as he broke the
three-year record for yards on the
ground held liy Hugh iYlcKllipnny,
lately of Washington, hy piling up
a total 2,.">04 vards in his three
Cal years, five more than hustling
Hugh could muster. Put as John
ny O said in the Pear dressing
room, "That Stanford line was one
of the hardest we have run against
;ill year. Tliev hit hard and played
good ball."
And it was Taylor who at the op
posite end of 11 if Stadium in a
steamy, quiet Card diessiug room
was praising the Cal backfield as
top'; and the one thing that beat the
Cards.

not without a fine try, and the jun

among themselves that they only
had one more year in which to beat

his second year as Card mentor with
a five-and-five record, was already

fornia in '53? That's a tough one
to answer, but I'll go on record as
saying that we should win our
opener against Santa Clara."
