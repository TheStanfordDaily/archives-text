# Power Failure Plagues Rooters As Red, White Blew All Over
## 
### PAT KING 
Chuck Taylor wasn't the only
'one with problems Saturday af
ternoon.
While the . Stanford varsity
was trying to find a "winning
play," Indian rooters had their
own worries and setbacks.
California winds ripped through
the rooting section before game
time, scattering instruction sheets
and cards like confetti. By half-time
the damage was so great that Stan
fordites had to content themselves
with throwing the cards up in the
aii-—a sorry ending for the 26 stunts
originally planned.
One coed was knocked out by a
! flying carrd near the end of the
game and was still dazed when
the final gun sounded. So was the
rest of the rooting section.
The Memorial Stadium electrician

had troubles too. The public ad
dress system failed, and when power
had finally been restored, the micro
phone in front of the Stanford root
ing section was dead. Zeke Wallace
waved his arms and shouted, but the
section couldn't understand him.
This "jinx" wasn't repaired until the
end of the fourth quarter. At least
the electric failure was impartial.
The California rooting section was
without a mike for a while, too.
Even the Stanford banner came
tumbling down from the poles above
the press box. Rally Com chairman
Fred Backer wrapped the bunting
up in his overcoat and carried it
down to the front of the stands after
winds had torn it loose.
Spirits were high before the
game. So high that one member
of the Dailv sports staff found
himself beng rolled part way
down the center of the rooting
section. The sun left the Stanford
side of the stadium early in the
afternoon, forcing rooters to hud
dle under coats and blankets to
keep warm.
Cal looters were quick to take
advantage of the Indians' woes.
From across the stadium they
taunted, "No banner, no card stunts,
no football team." Stanford's reply

was, "Why aren't YOU in the Rose
Bowl?" •
Attention was drawn from the
game momentarily when a B-36, us
ing only one propeller, lazily circled
over the field.
When the game ended there were
tears and jeers. Tears from seniors
who had lost their final chance to
get the Axe back home. Jeers for
the sea of blue and gold serenading
the Stanford section with "We've
got the Axe, we've got the Axe."
Three hours later almost every
one was happy. San Francisco
| hotels supplied red and blue hats,
horns, and noise-makers to the
| celebrants. Bitterness mellowed
! as the evening progressed, and by
midnight sons of the Stanford Red
were singing the Cal drinking
song.
At 1:30 a.m. the St. Francis Hotel
quivered. Trees in Union Square
trembled. From the garage below
boomed the one and only Axe Yell,
I given a full-throated treatment by
I 30 jubilant Indians.
On Sunday, beaten and tired,
! rooters trudged back to the Farm.
I Big Game was just a memory.
Coming up were golden Thanksgiv
ing pumpkin pies, followed by Dead
! Week blues.
