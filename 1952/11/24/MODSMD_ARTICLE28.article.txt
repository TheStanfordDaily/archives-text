# 'Red Hunts' Will Be Topic of Lunch
## 
### 
"The Danger of the Red Hunts"
will be the topic of the public affairs
discussion this noon on the third
floor of the Women's Clubhouse.
The coeducational discussion
group, led by Alberta and Carl Sto
ver, is sponsored by the YWCA. A
hot lunch will be served for 25
cents.

The little damage that did occur to
the campus can probably be attrib
uted to teen-agers from the local
area. Even they did not cause their
usual trouble.
The posts at the Palm Drive en
trance to the campus and a couple
of trees near the Quad were deco
ratd with blue "C's." The bonfire
was also touched oÂ£f on two occa
sions, but the fires were quickly
halted.
