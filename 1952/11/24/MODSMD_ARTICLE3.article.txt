UNITED NATIONS. N.Y., Nov. 23
(UP) —The American United Na
tions resolution to end the Korean
war probably will be shelved in
favor of India's revamped "compro
mise" blueprint, informed sources
revealed tonight.
This disclosure followed an emer
gency 105-minute meeting of the
21 sponsors of the American plan,
called after an Anglo - American
split on the Korean issue burst into
the open yesterday.
Despite the reported American
feeling that the revised Indian plan
still does not go far enough on the
crucial prisoner issue, Britain sug
gested to the 21 conferees that the
new Indian version be given prior
ity over their own resolution in the
UN debate, a highly placed infor
ant said.
This would be tantamount to
shelving the American - designed
plan and paving the way for a vote
first on the Indian program.
