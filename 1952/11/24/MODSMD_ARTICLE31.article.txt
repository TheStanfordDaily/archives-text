# 'PAPPY' HAPPY
## Waldorf Praises Card Running Attack, Mathias 
### PETE GROTHE 
Pappy Waldorf, sporting a green shirt, a flashing yellow tie,
and vigorously puffing a cigar, was a happy man last Saturday.
"Yes," chuckled bass-voiced Pappy, "It's an understatement to
say I'm happy. This was our finest game of the season. The de
fense was good, particularly the pass defense. And incidentally,

if I'm not mistaken, all 11 members
ol the starting deefnsive team will
be back next year,
A reporter asked Waldorf if any
aspect of the game surprised him.
'Yes, the Stanford running attack
was particularly effective. I didn't
think they could do that well with
out Crist and Garrett. There is no
question in my mind that Bob Ma
tliias is a great athlete. That boy
really ran today. I thought that Ron
Cook also ran well. Chuck Essegian,
tackle Barry Smith, led Tanner,
and Bill Storum bothered us on de
le use."
Fullback Johnny Olszewski, who
broke a three - year PCC rushing
record with 2,504 yards, was also
lavish with praise of the Stanford
defense. "They tackle and hit hard,
and I also think that Mathias is a
great player."
About Johnny O's performance,
Pappy had this to say, "We were all
happy about his record. The kids
got off the bench and crowded the
sidelines while he was trying to
make it. Olszewski didn't know
how close he was to the record.
Then, in the third quarter, quarter
back Ray Willsey relayed the mes
sage to him that he was only 28
yards away from the record. I(rom ,
then on. the kids gave him the ball :
about every time. They wanted to !
see him shatter Hugh McElhenny's 1
mark. He did, by five yards."
Waldorf also had a good word for !
Willsey. "Willsey handled the team |

â™¦
very well. He mixed the plays nice
ly. There was a time in the fourth
quarter when he didn't have much
to work with in the backfield. Don
Johnson and Bob Brooks had leg
j bruises and Bill Powell was hurt.
Waldorf diplomatically eased out
| of the problem of comparing Jackie
Jensen, the golden-haired boy, and
Olszewski. "I would say that John
l ny is as great a back as 1 ever.,
| coached. Jensen is a different type
:of player. He's more of a triple
I threat and a darter. I'd sure love to
I have both in the same backfield."
"But I thought that this Mathias
J was as good as anyone out there
today," he a;'ded.
