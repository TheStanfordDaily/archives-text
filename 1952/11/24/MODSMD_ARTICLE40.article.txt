# 49ers Bounced First-Place Tie
## 
### BILL WRIGHT Via Television 
Los Angeles' very rejuvenated
Rams turned on the pressure in the
second half to soundly whip the San
, Francisco 49ers, 35-9, winning their
J fifth straight game and sending the
| National Football League into a
four-way tie.
As a result of yesterday's games,
j Los Angeles, San Francisco, Detroit,
\ and Green Bay now share the divi
sion's top rung with just three
| weeks of the season remaining.
A crowd ol 77,9(58 at the Memorial
| Colkeum saw a muddy, sawdust
| covered turf slow down the 49ers,
i but not the Rams, particularly
! Woodly Lewis.
