## Who's Kidding Whom? 
### 
Stanford students went to the polls last Wed
nesday and put themselves against a proposal
which would have instigated farther discussion
on the liquor problem.
Stanford students fell right in line with the
hypocritical attitude now blandly evidenced in
the actions of the administration of Stanford Uni
versity, the government of the State of Califor
nia, and pretty much by the entire society in
which we live.
And we condemn this attitude. Some people
may feel it's logical and realistic, but we fail to
understand such warped reasoning.
The regulations— state, local, and University
— dealing with the liquor problem are well
known, and they are all against possession or
drinking of liquor by minors. In the specific
case of the University, the rule is against liquor
on campus.
Who's fooling whom? Be the guestion
"right" or "wrong," who honestly believes
the law is realistic when it is(l) so universally
disregarded and (2) so universally unen
forced? In fact, it appears as if the laws and
regulations are practically unenforceable.
And we challenge the Attorney General of
the State of California, and the President and
Dean of Students of Stanford University to
enforce the provisions regarding liguor to
which they have pledged themselves!
These regulations are contrary to the pro
vailing existing attitudes of our society. Maybe
they are morally "correct," but we believe it's
high time we stopped thinking that we arc so
morally good when our performance is so con
sistently inferior to our moral standards bo
they on liquor or sex.
Any lav/ which does not find as its basis a
prevailing attitude by a majority of the people
cannot possibly have a sound realistic basis
and wo dont' think the liquor law has such a
basis. We know of many instances to illustrate
this: A member of the administration offering
liquor to minor students ON CAMPUS. The
prevelanco of liquor at nearly EVEIIY private
closed club function on campus. The hypo
critical attitude of the Executive Committee it
self when, after voting down the liquor resolu
tion officially last Wednesday night, it ad
journed to a local bistro to celebrate a mem
ber's birthday. We ask again, who's kidding
whom?
We're tired of these agencies of administra
tion who pussy-loct around their regulations
and we challenge the administrators re

sponsible to start enforcing the laws. They're
on the hooks;.they should be enforced.
We're familiar with all this. We've soon it
happen in a state which had a constitutional
statute for prohibition for 66 years the state
of Kansas. And exactly the same situations pre
vailed there—the hypocritical, attitude of drink
ing wet and voting dry and no enforcement of
the law.
What changed the situation there? An ef
ficient attorney general (he's now governor)
who started living up to his oaths. He enforced
the law. He confiscated the liquor and boot
leggers' cars. He put the word of the law into
action. Then and only then did the two-faced
society wake up and face facts. Then and only
then did Kansas get the unrealistic prohibition
repealed — and they substituted for it an in
telligent and thoughtful, a practicable and real
istic law! In fact we dare say that it is one of
the best liquor laws in the country.
They waited 66 years to correct their faulty
law, but when they did act, they acted intel
ligently. It can be done. And we see no rea
son to wait 66 years or more in California.
Many students, we know, do recognize the
fault in the present law. We hope every in
terested student will not stop discussing the
issue and working for action —for only by
these means can we get rational improve
ment.
We think it is pitiful that so many Stanford
students are afraid to put up their hand and say
Stanford favors a realistic proposal to correct
this hypocritical situation. We favored the reso
lution because it at least was a measure which
would stimulate further discussion. We surely
did not believe it would pass the legislature as
is, but we did feel that it was a start on the
right road.
Since, however, the majority of students foe!
the present situation is apparently better, we
again urge (1) the administration of Stanford
University to start enforcing the regulations on
liquor - and we don't mean here and there, we
mean all over! And (2) the Attorney General of
California and the representatives of the Board
of Equalization to start enforcing the stiff laws
they have at their disposal there's no ques
tion they're being regularly violated.
Then, let's see how the students and their
families and friends really feel and let's get
an intelligent lav/, one that can be reasonably
enforced and WILL be reasonably enlorred!

mean all over! And (2) the Attorney General of
California and the representatives of the Board
of Equalization to start enforcing the stiff laws
they have at their disposal there's no ques
tion they're being regularly violated.
Then, let's see how the students and their
families and friends really feel and let's get
an intelligent lav/, one that can be reasonably
enforced and WILL be reasonably enlorred!
The Daily Editorial Board
Stanford students went to the polls last Wed
nesday and put themselves against a proposal
which would have instigated farther discussion
on the liquor problem.
Stanford students fell right in line with the
hypocritical attitude now blandly evidenced in
the actions of the administration of Stanford Uni
versity, the government of the State of Califor
nia, and pretty much by the entire society in
which we live.
And we condemn this attitude. Some people
may feel it's logical and realistic, but we fail to
understand such warped reasoning.
The regulations— state, local, and University
— dealing with the liquor problem are well
known, and they are all against possession or
drinking of liquor by minors. In the specific
case of the University, the rule is against liquor
on campus.
Who's fooling whom? Be the guestion
"right" or "wrong," who honestly believes
the law is realistic when it is(l) so universally
disregarded and (2) so universally unen
forced? In fact, it appears as if the laws and
regulations are practically unenforceable.
And we challenge the Attorney General of
the State of California, and the President and
Dean of Students of Stanford University to
enforce the provisions regarding liguor to
which they have pledged themselves!
These regulations are contrary to the pro
vailing existing attitudes of our society. Maybe
they are morally "correct," but we believe it's
high time we stopped thinking that we arc so
morally good when our performance is so con
sistently inferior to our moral standards bo
they on liquor or sex.
Any lav/ which does not find as its basis a
prevailing attitude by a majority of the people
cannot possibly have a sound realistic basis
and wo dont' think the liquor law has such a
basis. We know of many instances to illustrate
this: A member of the administration offering
liquor to minor students ON CAMPUS. The
prevelanco of liquor at nearly EVEIIY private
closed club function on campus. The hypo
critical attitude of the Executive Committee it
self when, after voting down the liquor resolu
tion officially last Wednesday night, it ad
journed to a local bistro to celebrate a mem
ber's birthday. We ask again, who's kidding
whom?
We're tired of these agencies of administra
tion who pussy-loct around their regulations
and we challenge the administrators re

sponsible to start enforcing the laws. They're
on the hooks;.they should be enforced.
We're familiar with all this. We've soon it
happen in a state which had a constitutional
statute for prohibition for 66 years the state
of Kansas. And exactly the same situations pre
vailed there—the hypocritical, attitude of drink
ing wet and voting dry and no enforcement of
the law.
What changed the situation there? An ef
ficient attorney general (he's now governor)
who started living up to his oaths. He enforced
the law. He confiscated the liquor and boot
leggers' cars. He put the word of the law into
action. Then and only then did the two-faced
society wake up and face facts. Then and only
then did Kansas get the unrealistic prohibition
repealed — and they substituted for it an in
telligent and thoughtful, a practicable and real
istic law! In fact we dare say that it is one of
the best liquor laws in the country.
They waited 66 years to correct their faulty
law, but when they did act, they acted intel
ligently. It can be done. And we see no rea
son to wait 66 years or more in California.
Many students, we know, do recognize the
fault in the present law. We hope every in
terested student will not stop discussing the
issue and working for action —for only by
these means can we get rational improve
ment.
We think it is pitiful that so many Stanford
students are afraid to put up their hand and say
Stanford favors a realistic proposal to correct
this hypocritical situation. We favored the reso
lution because it at least was a measure which
would stimulate further discussion. We surely
did not believe it would pass the legislature as
is, but we did feel that it was a start on the
right road.
Since, however, the majority of students foe!
the present situation is apparently better, we
again urge (1) the administration of Stanford
University to start enforcing the regulations on
liquor - and we don't mean here and there, we
mean all over! And (2) the Attorney General of

lution because it at least was a measure which
would stimulate further discussion. We surely
did not believe it would pass the legislature as
is, but we did feel that it was a start on the
right road.
Since, however, the majority of students foe!
the present situation is apparently better, we
again urge (1) the administration of Stanford
University to start enforcing the regulations on
liquor - and we don't mean here and there, we
mean all over! And (2) the Attorney General of
California and the representatives of the Board
of Equalization to start enforcing the stiff laws
they have at their disposal there's no ques
tion they're being regularly violated.
Then, let's see how the students and their
families and friends really feel and let's get
an intelligent lav/, one that can be reasonably
enforced and WILL be reasonably enlorred!
The Daily Editorial Board
Stanford students went to the polls last Wed
nesday and put themselves against a proposal
which would have instigated farther discussion
on the liquor problem.
Stanford students fell right in line with the
hypocritical attitude now blandly evidenced in
the actions of the administration of Stanford Uni
versity, the government of the State of Califor
nia, and pretty much by the entire society in
which we live.
And we condemn this attitude. Some people
may feel it's logical and realistic, but we fail to
understand such warped reasoning.
The regulations— state, local, and University
— dealing with the liquor problem are well
known, and they are all against possession or
drinking of liquor by minors. In the specific
case of the University, the rule is against liquor
on campus.
Who's fooling whom? Be the guestion
"right" or "wrong," who honestly believes
the law is realistic when it is(l) so universally
disregarded and (2) so universally unen
forced? In fact, it appears as if the laws and
regulations are practically unenforceable.
And we challenge the Attorney General of
the State of California, and the President and
Dean of Students of Stanford University to
enforce the provisions regarding liguor to
which they have pledged themselves!
These regulations are contrary to the pro
vailing existing attitudes of our society. Maybe
they are morally "correct," but we believe it's
high time we stopped thinking that we arc so
morally good when our performance is so con
sistently inferior to our moral standards bo
they on liquor or sex.
Any lav/ which does not find as its basis a
prevailing attitude by a majority of the people
cannot possibly have a sound realistic basis
and wo dont' think the liquor law has such a
basis. We know of many instances to illustrate
this: A member of the administration offering
liquor to minor students ON CAMPUS. The
prevelanco of liquor at nearly EVEIIY private
closed club function on campus. The hypo
critical attitude of the Executive Committee it
self when, after voting down the liquor resolu
tion officially last Wednesday night, it ad
journed to a local bistro to celebrate a mem
ber's birthday. We ask again, who's kidding
whom?
We're tired of these agencies of administra
tion who pussy-loct around their regulations
and we challenge the administrators re

sponsible to start enforcing the laws. They're
on the hooks;.they should be enforced.
We're familiar with all this. We've soon it
happen in a state which had a constitutional
statute for prohibition for 66 years the state
of Kansas. And exactly the same situations pre
vailed there—the hypocritical, attitude of drink
ing wet and voting dry and no enforcement of
the law.
What changed the situation there? An ef
ficient attorney general (he's now governor)
who started living up to his oaths. He enforced
the law. He confiscated the liquor and boot
leggers' cars. He put the word of the law into
action. Then and only then did the two-faced
society wake up and face facts. Then and only
then did Kansas get the unrealistic prohibition
repealed — and they substituted for it an in
telligent and thoughtful, a practicable and real
istic law! In fact we dare say that it is one of
the best liquor laws in the country.
They waited 66 years to correct their faulty
law, but when they did act, they acted intel
ligently. It can be done. And we see no rea
son to wait 66 years or more in California.
Many students, we know, do recognize the
fault in the present law. We hope every in
terested student will not stop discussing the
issue and working for action —for only by
these means can we get rational improve
ment.
We think it is pitiful that so many Stanford
students are afraid to put up their hand and say
