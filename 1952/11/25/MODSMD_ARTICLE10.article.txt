# Shrinkage Forms Due
## 
### 
Applications for shrinkage may be
made in Room 101-A torlay by
â€¢women who remained in the room
drawing last week, but were not as
signed to one of their three top
choices.
Any vacancies occurring after the
regular drawing will be filled from
the shrinkage list, according to class
and number drawn.
According to a new rule an
nounced by AWS Housing Commit
tee, shrinkage is now a contract,
and women must accept if a vacancy
occurs in one of their three shrink
age choices.
However, when they apply they
may elect to stay on shrinkage ei
ther from drawing until Reg Day
(Jan. 5) or from drawing until two
weeks after Reg Day.
The first alternative means that
women will not have to move from
their residence when once settled.
However, vacancies often occur
during the first two weeks of a
quarter, and some women may wish
to be eligible for them.
Women who draw together may
apply for shrinkage and will be as
signed separately according to the
order in which their names ap
peared on the drawing card.
Old women students who are re
turning to campus will be placed at
the top of the shrinkage list if they
do not wish to return to their old
residence, and at the bottom if they
do wish to return.
