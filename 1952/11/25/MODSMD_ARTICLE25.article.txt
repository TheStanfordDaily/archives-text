Thfvf is grave danger in making remarks about the
oldest aits, because there are no documents on (lie
subject to lean on an quarrel over, and without docu
ments what is your thinking worth? at least, that is
Ihe pro|H»r attitude to take in an institution ol higher
learning. Still, if 1 were so rash as to consider the
topic unsupported, 1 should maintain that the mimetic
is one of the oldest —one that at base man shares with
the animals, and which has been brought by him to
a point furthest from animal things merely. Its virtues
are so various that some of its practitioners never
touch some of their brethren (I iw»n «etors and

evangelists, lor instance): but it
is the first school of morals that
any uf us know, and in its higher
reaches remains so when a cul
ture is sound; it gives a more pro
found and complete joy than any
other high art can do; and it is
indestructible. Every age of the
.voi Id has said tluit the theatre,
vhieh is advanced miming, is
lying; pay no heed to such re
marks. The thing is impossible.

Theatre and acting have undergone singular for
tune.-, in public esteem, it is true. At one time the
tage has a part in serious civic celebration, at another
its artists are excommunicated vagabonds; at another
it is the chief expression of a royal circle, while many
of the rest of the citizenry regard it as a chute to
ruin. In Europe it is a means of self-understanding
in a nation, and receives government support, but
with us it is still looked Upon with a Puritan eye
.suffering from astigmatism: we know it is Cultural,
and pay taxes to support the study of it in schools and
colleges, but in general there is the .underlying as
sumption that it is really a useless adornment, and
that people who engage in its practices are not quite
«juUe, if you grasp my meaning.
But with all this, although the old, controlled,
extravagant theatre of the capital cities is growing
thinner and paler, the stage and the actors are far
from undiminished—they grow l>y leaps and hounds
too pun, please). There is scarcely a town of 8,000
which fails to have a community theatre; there is
scarcely a high school or college which fails'to teach
and practice drama. True, the very proper have to
find an excuse other than art for such a situation in
some centers: it is alleged to he a therapy for the
mentally disturbed, it is a sociological experiment
in suppressing delinquency, it creates poise, it makes
friends for the unloved, it trains after-dinner speak
ers. At worst, in the drama departments of the
schools as in the professional theatres, the actors
and the play are submerged under waves of vo
cational training in lighting and set design, But the
art proceeds to strengthen itself more and more
widely, without being pulled to pieces in the Pro
crustean bed of vocational-sociological education.
This Peninsula, from San Francisco to San Jose, is

one of the richest fields of the vil;il new theatre.
State-supported theatres exist in IVlilibrae, San Mateo,
Kedwood City, Saratoga; Palo Alto has a civic theatre;
Menlo, San Carlos, San Jose, oiler plays supported by
private groups. Ihe theatres travel around to visit
each other: annually in July or August, lour theatres
from other towns come to Palo Alto to give unusual
plays in a season called the Peninsula Drama Festival;
in spring the national ANTA offers another festival
at Monterey, with visiting troupes from towns as far
away # as Porterville or Reno; the ebullient Straw
hatters present their revue the year round on tour;
the Wharf Players come up to Saratoga for a per
formance; next January the Golden Ilind Company of
Berkeley conies to Palo Alto with an eighteenth cen
tury play. •
On the rare week-ends when there is no pla.v to
he seen at the 4'eninsiila theatres, playgoers wedge
themselves into ears and depart far Alameda, Val
lejo, Boss, I.os Gains, to see what is being done
there. There is always something heing done; and
though the actors arc not professional, and polish
is not always even, the pace, the energy, the grasp
of a play's meaning, is more secure than it is in the
professional companies who deposit their weary
laborers on our coast. In recent months we have
seen a "Born Yesterday," a "Death of a Salesman,"
a "Life with Mother," a "Billy Budd," all far richer
and livelier than a professional troupe could offer
because every actor in every piece is contributing
everything he has to the whole play; and beyond this
list there are such fftiislied performances of old plays
as "The Man of Mode," which are never seen at all
anywhere else. Often a play murdered by the in
difference of New York comes to life as a very fine
thing after all. It may he a skittish comedy such as
"Life with Mother," or a sardonic comment on our
entire domestic civilization, such as "Autumn Gar
den;" both of these plays in community theatres as
sumed a solid stature which New York would not
allow.
As for new plays, the community theatres are com
ing to the chief hope of the playwright (as indestruc
tible as the actor!), rather than metropolitan pro
ducers. Competitions exist all over the country for the
purpose of finding new playwrights, and the awards
usually are partly cash and partly production. The
Peninsula has its own organization for this purpose,
largely composed of Stanford graduates who learned
their drama the hard way in the old assembly hall,
and know all* there is to know of the hardships of the
stage; the association has entertained playwrights
from New York, Washington, Connecticut, who have
come to see what their plays lack in the staging, and
to rewrite with the enthusiastic suggestions of com
munity theatre directors in the neighborhood.
This is the beginning of a theatre which is expres
sion of an unaffected and self-critical national culture.
Only one thing puzzles me. In the audiences that
support these theatres and playwrights, where are the
students of the University?
