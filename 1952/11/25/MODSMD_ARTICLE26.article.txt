# BULL SESSION

### BOB STETSON 
This is Tuesday morning. The Pig Game has come
and gone, and the day after the Big Game has come
and gone.
1 aid not going to say a thing about the Big Game
and certainly not anything about the day after the
Big Game.
That's the way it goes.
* * *
In his Bull Session of several weeks ago, Pete Grothe
wrote about a book called "Great Moments in Staii-

ford Sports." One could buy this
book, read it, and enjoy it.
In today's Bull Session I want
to tell you about something far
better, tar le.ss expensive, and far
more useful.
Many Stanford students have
either men or women (as the case
may t>e) away froiji Stanford that
[W>sse:;s amorous propensities for
them, i.e. they have boy friends
or girl friends. There is always

the problem of writing a nice, friendly, warm letter
(•I them at least once a week.
Knowing how wearing this can become on the
busy schedules of Stanford students, I am intro
ducing a sensational new olVer.
Three experts, Greg Danninger, my roommate;
Hill Travei-s, a guy from down the hall; and I have
<om(Mi.f(l a serve-all letter. This epistle will make
love and happiness spring forth anew in the heart
of even the most disillusioned of female or male
friends (as the case may he).
For only ten cents, to cover handling costs, you
nay have a mimeographed copy of the following
t iter, reproduced in its entirety. It has been care
fully written by these three successful loVers who

have on file 32,000 testimonials of tlioir abilities.
This is your lig chance. One to a customer. Send
your clime to P.O. Box 24.'i1, Stanford University,
Stanford, Calif.

This lovely day
My —, (dear, darling, dearest):
1 am terribly sorry 1 have not written yon sooner.
1 have been too (busy studying, dreaming of
you, hungovet 1 ). The thought of your warm
(till in at your own discretion) and all the
(good time:, we've had, good times we should have
had) gives me the strength to fare the slings and
arrows of outrageous misfortune here at Stanford.
(Honestly However) your (beauti
ful, ha nelson if) — (lace, body) does help me
to get through each and every (day, night).
Since 1 have been here I have had (no,
three, sixty-one) dates. of them were blind
although one had partial vision out of (her,
his) right eye. JVly darling, none of them could be
compared to you in (any way, some ways).
There is not a (girl, boy) on the campus that
can equal your (rugged handsomeness,
vulptuous beauty, virtuous attitude). This
(wonderful, horrible) Stanford ratio has made no
difference to me because (I live on my
memories of you, I have no desire). All the relation
ships 1 have had with the opposite sex have been
strictly Platonic. Nevertheless, Plato is a pretty nice
(girl, fellow). 1 am studying (her,
him) in Civ. Anyway, all the (girls, boys)
up here are (fast, slow), but as you know I
am even faster than they are.

This lovely day
My —, (dear, darling, dearest):
1 am terribly sorry 1 have not written yon sooner.
1 have been too (busy studying, dreaming of
you, hungovet 1 ). The thought of your warm
(till in at your own discretion) and all the
(good time:, we've had, good times we should have
had) gives me the strength to fare the slings and
arrows of outrageous misfortune here at Stanford.
(Honestly However) your (beauti
ful, ha nelson if) — (lace, body) does help me
to get through each and every (day, night).
Since 1 have been here I have had (no,
three, sixty-one) dates. of them were blind
although one had partial vision out of (her,
his) right eye. JVly darling, none of them could be
compared to you in (any way, some ways).
There is not a (girl, boy) on the campus that
can equal your (rugged handsomeness,
vulptuous beauty, virtuous attitude). This
(wonderful, horrible) Stanford ratio has made no
difference to me because (I live on my
memories of you, I have no desire). All the relation
ships 1 have had with the opposite sex have been
strictly Platonic. Nevertheless, Plato is a pretty nice
(girl, fellow). 1 am studying (her,
him) in Civ. Anyway, all the (girls, boys)
up here are (fast, slow), but as you know I
am even faster than they are.
