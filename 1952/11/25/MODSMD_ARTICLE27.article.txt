To the Editor:
The Stanford Liquor resolution has been defeated.
The majority has spoken. Why cannot the Daily ac
cept. the lact. that a majority of the students disagrees
with them and let the matter rest?
'Ihe Daily asserts: "Any law which does not find
as its basis a prevailing attitude by the majority of
the |*x>ple cannot possibly have a sound realistic
basis." Did not a majority of Stanford voters defeat
the Rmolution on both counts? Does not this rep
resent "a prevailing attitude by the majority?"
The analogy between the liquor situation in Kansas
and that in California is a poor one. A law establish
ing ail -out Prohibition is one thing; a law establishing
the minimum drinking age at the same level as the
age ol legal responsibility is another.
"'1 he resolution . . . was a measure which would
stimulate further discussion." It certainly would!
Stanford has In-en criticized for having its name as
sociated unofficially with a reputable presidential can
didate. How much more would we be criticized for
supporting a resolution of dubious moral implications!
The Daily attacks the present law as unrealistic.
And yet is realism always a test of value? Did not
the editor of The Daily support compulsory federal
h'F.PC 9 Ju't because such a law is not completely

realistic- wore the Democratic party and Miss Dodge
wrong in their stand on this issue?
The "prevailing attitude ol the majority" was ex
pressed at the polls last Wednesday. The Daily would
do well to acknowledge this fact, and accept the
verdict.

(Kditor's note: The Daily has never felt that it
has to agree with student opinion, any more than
it has felt that the students have to agree with The
Daily.)
