To the Editor:
The admiration of all Stanford men and women
goes out to a courageous football team that never
stopped trying and wasn't licked until the final gun.
I! goes, likewise, to a sportsmanlike, well-mannered
rooting section which stayed in the stands and took
everything the Cal mob dished out, with dignity and
restraint. Both the team anil the section were splendid
in defeat. We can be proud of these demonstrations
of Stanford spirit
