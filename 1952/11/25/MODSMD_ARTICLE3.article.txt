# CIO Gathers To Pick Prexy

### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 24 (UP)â€”Top
CIO officials went into an emer
gency night session tonight, in an
effort to end a flaring intra-union
rivalry and agree upon a new presi
dent to succeed the late Philip Mur
ray.
After failing to reach agreement
in a five-hour conference earlier to
day, seven vice-presidents and three
executive board members of the 5,-
000,000 - member labor organization
met again at 8:25 p.m. (EST).
They were trying desperately to
prevent an open showdown between
Walter Reuther, president of the
United Auto Workers, and CIO Ex
ecutive Vice - President Allan S.
Haywood from reaching the CIO
convention floor next week.
The struggle between the two
men for the ClO's top post threat
ened to shape up into an all-out
fight between the UAW and the
United Steelworkers, the two larg
est unions in the CIO.
