# Daily Bares Expose Of Checkered Past

### MARGARET DALGLIESH 
The palms along Palm Drive are not quite trees, the doors to
Quad classes are not quite open, in fact, Stanford isn't quite Stan
ford as we know it. The year is 1891, the birth-date of both the
University and its newspaper.
A month before the very first registration, a prospective transfer

student from the University of
Michigan, George Lawrence, wrote
the University suggesting that a
University newspaper be started.
He suggested that it be called "The
Stanford Review," or any other
name which would be satisfactory to
the administration.
Lawrence's idea took hold and on
opening day the monthly "Palo
Alto" appeared, one of the few col
lege newspapers started simultane
ously with the opening of a univer
sity.
Willi this beginning, a Stanford
newspaper became part of the
University. II has been published
continuously since October 1891—
published "for, with, of, to, and
hy the students."
Its run as a monthly paper was
short lived and it quickly became
the "Daily Palo Alto."
Almost since the beginning, this
Stanford publication has been tag
ged "The Dippy." The nickname
started in 1900 during the reign of
Ibc "Daily Palo Alto," when, shortly
after the 00 earthquake, a reporter
in a hurry to return to the DPA
oflice mispronounced the three ini
tials and inadvertently hurried back
to the "Dippy" oflice. And so "Dip
py" it has been ever since.
The paper came of age on ail
eventful night in Seplemht r
when the "Daily Palo Alto"
evolved into "The Stanford Daily."
Perhaps the scene was something
like this: The hour, 12:05 a.m.; the
atmosphere, a smoke - filled room
with editors, copyreadtrs, and re
porters, all just waiting for the first
copy ol "The Stanford Daily" to
come off the press.
Then a pressman casually walked
from the back shop: "Congratula
tions, Mr. Bennett. You're the fa
ther of a wonderful brand new pa
per!"
The baby weighed eight pages at
birth and was resting much more
comfortably than his father. Mr.
Bennett-—Editor Ilarry M. Bennett
—began to fuss and fidget and stam
mer as only Daily editors can. The
first issue of The Stanford Daily was
out.

Kdiloiial policies have changed
from time to time; in fact, at one
time the entire hoard of editors
resigned in a hody. This was pro
voked hy ail allotype reproduc
tion of Simoni's "Slave Merchant
at the Harem" which was printed
in the paper.
If one were to wander Over to the
"shack" (a more or less accurate
description of the Daily oflice) to
day, the neat pine walls would not
look quite as neat as they did on
that eventful night 20 years ago.
The class of '50 began a tradition
when as freshmen they added to the
beauty of the "Shack." After every
spring's frosh edition has gone to
press, triumphant freshmen are en
titled to add their names and appro
priate phrases to the walls or ceil
ing to remain a permanent part of
(he shack.

The class of '50 began a tradition
when as freshmen they added to the
beauty of the "Shack." After every
spring's frosh edition has gone to
press, triumphant freshmen are en

The palms along Palm Drive are not quite trees, the doors to
Quad classes are not quite open, in fact, Stanford isn't quite Stan
ford as we know it. The year is 1891, the birth-date of both the
University and its newspaper.
A month before the very first registration, a prospective transfer

student from the University of
Michigan, George Lawrence, wrote
the University suggesting that a
University newspaper be started.
He suggested that it be called "The
Stanford Review," or any other
name which would be satisfactory to
the administration.
Lawrence's idea took hold and on
opening day the monthly "Palo
Alto" appeared, one of the few col
lege newspapers started simultane
ously with the opening of a univer
sity.
Willi this beginning, a Stanford
newspaper became part of the
University. II has been published
continuously since October 1891—
published "for, with, of, to, and
hy the students."
Its run as a monthly paper was
short lived and it quickly became
the "Daily Palo Alto."
Almost since the beginning, this
Stanford publication has been tag
ged "The Dippy." The nickname
started in 1900 during the reign of
Ibc "Daily Palo Alto," when, shortly
after the 00 earthquake, a reporter
in a hurry to return to the DPA
oflice mispronounced the three ini
tials and inadvertently hurried back
to the "Dippy" oflice. And so "Dip
py" it has been ever since.
The paper came of age on ail
eventful night in Seplemht r
when the "Daily Palo Alto"
evolved into "The Stanford Daily."
Perhaps the scene was something
like this: The hour, 12:05 a.m.; the
atmosphere, a smoke - filled room
with editors, copyreadtrs, and re
porters, all just waiting for the first
copy ol "The Stanford Daily" to
come off the press.
Then a pressman casually walked
from the back shop: "Congratula
tions, Mr. Bennett. You're the fa
ther of a wonderful brand new pa
per!"
The baby weighed eight pages at
birth and was resting much more
comfortably than his father. Mr.
Bennett-—Editor Ilarry M. Bennett
—began to fuss and fidget and stam
mer as only Daily editors can. The
first issue of The Stanford Daily was
out.

Kdiloiial policies have changed
from time to time; in fact, at one
time the entire hoard of editors
resigned in a hody. This was pro

in the paper.
