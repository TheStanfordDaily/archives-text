# Scientist Finds Sex-Hormone Key
## 
### 
A drug call ed neostigmine may be I
the key that will unlock sex hor- I
mones trom the body's pituitary i
glands, judging from a series of ex
periments conducted by a Stanford!
medical scientist.
The scientist is Dr. C. Frederic I
Fluhmann, clinical professor of ob- j
stetrics at Stanlord School of Medi
cine and a prominent San Francisco !
physician. He reported his findings 1
at a recent meeting of the Pacific;l
Coast Obstetrical and Gynecological
Society at Pebble Beach.
In his experiments, immature fe- |
male rats were given daily doses
|of neostigmine. As a result, all i
showed premature development ol j
ovarian activity as compared with
control groups of rats which did not :
receive the drug.
