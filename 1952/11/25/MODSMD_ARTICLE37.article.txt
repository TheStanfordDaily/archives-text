## Wisconsin Selected For Rose Bowl Trip 
### 
'I he University of Wisconsin, boasting a 6-2-1 record and tied
with Purdue for the Western Conference Championship, v/as nom
inated yesterday to represent the Big Ten in the Rose Bowl.
The age old boogy-man of Big Ten supremacy seems at last to
"be broken, and so, it is hoped will their string of January Ist vic-

tories. One of the two above-men
tioned defeat* came at the hands o!
IK't,A, 20-7, earlier in the season.
Only two points and tiie USC Tro
jans .stood between UCLA and the
J'CC Ko.se Bowl bid. The stone wall
ill Troy held off the attacks of Cam
eron and crew to garnish win num
ber nine last Saturday, 14-12, while
Wisconsin tied Minnesota, 21-21, to
earn a statistical tie widi Purdue
and the bid.
The co-championship tossed the
l.'ose Bowl selection into the laps
ol athletic directors of the member
j-ehuols I or an unprecedented vote.
The 10 electors voted on only one
basis:
"Which team will best represent
the liig Ten in the Hose Bowl?"
(If some importance in making

the t'eci-fion was undoubtedly the
fact that SC ami not UCLA would
rcpre cut the West Coast. Abo,
Wisconsin was one of the schools
against tin; Rose Bowl pact, and
had not figured in the league title
in 41) years.
This will be the second time
that Troy has faced the Big 10 since
the origin of the pact. The last time,
in 1048, Michigan's all-time great
team blasted Southern California
40-0.
. In this year's New Year's Day ti
tanic, the Trojans and their band
will both be favorites to win, for
the first time in cons.
