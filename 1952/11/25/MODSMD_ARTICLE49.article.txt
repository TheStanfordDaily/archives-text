(Skjorsand is a small sub
urb of Bergen, the second larg
est city in Norway. It lies in
the shadows ot seven rugged
mountains which rise abruptly
from one of the hundreds of
fjords lining the west coast of
the Scandinavian peninsula.
The people of Skjorsand owe
1 their existence to fish in the
j Norwegian sea, the lumber on
the Norwegian mountainsides,
and the ships which connect
Norway with the rest of the
world.)
John Dale, one of the eight
ASSU foreign scholars studying
at Stanford this year, has spent
most of his 19 years in his birth
place, Skjorsand ger Bergen,
Norway.
He has come to America and
Stanford, not in the b-dief that they
may offer him better academic train
j ing in his major field of interna
i tional relations, but in the hope that
he may "learn more about the lead
er of the Western world."
The soft-spoken 13-year-old Nor
wegian scholar believes that during
his year of study at Stanford he
must not only take full advantage
of the opportunities for knowledge
offered in the classroom, but over
come some of the typical miscon
ceptions Europeans hold about the
American people.
"In Norway our ideas about the
United States arc gathered pri
marily from the Hollywood mo
tion picture description, a descrip
| tion which offers the motor car
and the wealthy as the exempli
fication of American society."
As a result of this one-sided de
scription of America, John Dale is
intent on seeing more than what
he terms "the brilliant, side of your
country," the usual tourist attrac
tions of America's larger cities.
During the eight weeks he has
been in the United States he has
gone beyond the "brilliant side" in
his search for a deeper knowledge of
I the United States.
In New York last September, he
was not content with views of the
Statue of Liberty, Grant's Tomb.
1 and the Empire State Building; he
112 examined the people and condi
tions of Harlem and the New York
1 skid row, the Bowery.
He traveled by train and car
: across the United States to qet to
Stanford, and each time he had a
chance he stopped to look around
him and talk to the people of the
: city in which he found himself.
Throughout his "American expe
rience" the Norwegian scholar main
-1 tains the perspective of the citizen
! of the small country which accepts
I the United States as the leader in
the formation of the policies and
i programs of the Western world.
So far he has found no basic
difference between the people of
the United States and the people
of Norway. "We think alike and
we want the same things for our
selves and the world. The only
difference lies in the methods with
which we hope to achieve our
j mutual goals,"
He saw one of those differences
i demonstrated in the recent election
j campaign.
"Emotion plays a greater part in
i your electioneering than it docs in
| Norway," he says. "Norwegians
i would not care about the validity of

the Irish ancestry of the Vice-Pres
idential candidate's wife."
lie was also amazed by the "cir
cus" atmosphere of the campaign
and the emphasis on scandals in
the parties and personalities of in
dividual candidates.
By the end of this year, foreign
scholar John Dale will have re
ceived his A.B. degree and will have
seen both the "brilliant and non
brilliant" aspects of the American
nation. His degree from Stanford,
he hopes, will enable him to secure
work in the foreign service of Nor
way.
Whatever the success of his ef
fort ~ ASSU foreign scholar John
Dale will return to Skjorsand ger
Bergen next June knowing that
America is more than a country
of "motor cars and wealthy."
He will be able to give substance
to what he calls a "strong pro-
America attitude'' of the people of
the Scandinavian countries, an at
titude which repudiates Communism
as a symbol of totalitarian rule and
appreciates the concern the United
States shows for the "smaller na
tions" of the'world.
