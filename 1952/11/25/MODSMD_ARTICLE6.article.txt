### 
SEOUL, Korea, Tuesday, Nov. 25
(UP)â€”Military and civilian officials
made plans today to post a bullet
proof guard around Dwight D. Ei
senhower to forestall any "crack
pot" who may try to kill him during
his visit to Korea.
Washington Secret Service men
were rumored to be in Seoul this
morning to join Eighth Army mili
tary police and Korean police
charged with the President - elect's
safety while here. United Nations
commander Gen. Mark W. Clark
also was here to confer with his top
Korean commanders on security
plans for the Eisenhower vi-sit.
Local officials assigned to the se
curity guard said that Eisenhower's
greatest danger was not from a
Communist air attack through the
UN Sabre-jet screen over Korea but
from some ''disgruntled Korean or
Communist" who may try to kill the
visitor with bullets or a bomb dur
ing a public appearance.
