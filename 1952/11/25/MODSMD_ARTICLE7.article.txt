### Richard Witkin UP Staff Correspondent 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Nov.
24 (UP)- Russia today rejected
India's Korean peace proposal,
declaring "it is designed not to
end the war but to perpetuate it."
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Y.
Vishinsky treated the Indians with
surprising antagonism. He said the
revamped Indian' plan "is anything
but a timely attempt to solve the
deadlock created by the Anglo-
American bloc."
Vishinsky's blunt rejection, made
in an unheralded appearance be
fore the General Assembly's Main
Political Committee, smashed hopes
that the Indian formula might con
tain the compromise that would
solve the truce deadlock.
The Kremlin's No. 1 mouthpiece
insisted that a Korean proposal Rus
sia has made provided the only ac
ceptable solution to the Korean war.
Actually, it is totally unacceptable
to the United States and its allies.
The Russian plan, revamped yes
terday while the Indains were revis
ing theirs, calls for an immediate
cease-fire in Korea. After that, the
problem of repatriating "all" prison
ers would be given to an 11-nation
commission in which a four-member
Communist bloc would have the
power to block any action. Such a
proposal had been made earlier by
Communist Poland.
Vishinsky took the floor at the
opening of the afternoon debate in a
surprise move, taking the spot re
served by its ally, Poland. He spoke
for an hour and a half.
Secretary of State Dean Acheson
was. due to speak fourth—following
Syria and Afghanistan. Acheson
planned to explain fully the U.S. po
sition on the revised Indian plan
and explain the "clarifications'' the
U.S. feels are needed to bring it into
line with the basic U.S. principle
that no war prisoners must be
forced to go home or be held in
custody indefinitely.
The Soviet foreign minister again
and again insisted that the Geneva
Convention on war prisoners makes
mandatory the return of all prison
ers, whether they want to return
home or not.
