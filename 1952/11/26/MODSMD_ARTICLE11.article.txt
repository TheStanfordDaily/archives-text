# Registrar's Office Gains Use of 14 New IBM's
## 
### RUTH JAHNKE 
Fourteen IBM machines will
start working for the Registrar's
Office next week.
Registrar Harvey Hall and As
sistant Registrar Elmer Wagner
said that these machines will be
to speed up the process of
computing basic data about the
students and preparing useful
statistics.
The resulting computations will
bo used by the Deans of Men and
Women, the Recorder's Office, and
the Registrar's Office^
One of the most important fea
tures of the use of these machines,
Hall pointed out, is that it will speed
up the preparation of certifications,
Fprm 109, for the draft boards at
the end of the year.
The process will begin when the
advisers give students machine rec
ord information cards, which the
students will fill out. and turn in to
the check-out clerk with the official
study-list cards when pre-registra
tion has been completed.
llall emphasized that the maxi
mum number of students should
prc-reg, so that the machines can
do as much as possible of the nec
essary wo'k before the official
registration a month later. Data

on new students and old return
ing students will be pickcd up
during the registration procedure
nest January.
The machines, which reside in the
Encina basement, include four key
punchers, two tabulators, two sort
ers, two verifiers, one interpreter,
one coalator, one multiplier, and
one summary reproducer.
These various machines perform
the work indicated by their names,
and will eventually reduce the time
now needed to prepare the statistics
on living groups, scholarship, rosters
of students enrolled in courses for
the use of instructors, and grade re
ports.
Oracle sheets will not be includ
ed in the reg booklets, but will be
replaced by small sheets contain
ing the grades of the previous
quarter, the total units attempted,
the total units passed, and the cu
mulative grade point. The regular
grade sheet will be issued with the
fall quarter reg books, however,
listing the courses and grades
earned in total.
Students will receive the infor
mation cards when they consult
their advisers Wednesday, Dec. 3;
Thursday, Dec. 4; and Friday, Dec.
5, during their special office hours.
The cards are to be turned in to the
check - out clerk with the official
study-list card after prc-regging.
