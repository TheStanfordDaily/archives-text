# War Threat Discounted by Former U.S. Diplomat
##

By HADLEY ROFF
. There is little chance of all- j
out war with Russia in the near ,
future ... at least that is the 1
opinion of Norman Stines, who
until March was first secretary
of the American embassy in
Moscow.
Stincs, who graduated from Stan
ford in 19.t5, provided members of
Sigma Delta Chi, profcssionla jour- |
nalism fraternity, with a penctrat- ;
ing peek behind the Iron Curtain j
when he addressed them Monday j
night.
The stocky, square-jawed junior
diplomat, who went to Moscow in {
July, 1951, said that it was his im
pression that Russia was not equip
ped to wage an all-out war.
lie said Stalin, master of the
USSR, is a conservative who real
izes that war, with its threat of
A- and 11-bomb devastation,
might prove inconclusive. It is
Stalin's hope, Stincs said, to causc
dissent among the Western Allies, ,
atcmpting to fracturc uuity and i

disrupt trade. In that way, Stincs >
declared, Stalin will promote ceo
nomic eollapsc among the intri
, catcly interdependent Western na
i tions.
Economic collapse is the prime!
' hope of the Soviet leaders, Stines
i said.
Stincs, during his almost two
years' stay in Russia, collected a
number of colored snapshots which
he showed the journalist group.
Many of the pictures were taken on
the sly, contrary to a state police j
: bun.
He said that state police, both
uniformed and plalnclothed, patrol
the streets constantly. Whcn<®-er he
left Moscow, even for a short ride
during the summer, he was followed
by agents of the police.
He reported that Ambassador
! George F. Kennaii, favorite target
of Russian propaagnda. was con
stantly tailed by four burly Russian ;
agents.
The colored pictures showed viv- i
idly the sad conditions of Russian
I housing. Many of the buildings pic
-1 tuied were crumbling from lack of ]

repair. And many of those build- \
inss— unpuinted, with sagging roofs j

and leaning walls liou.se a grent
number of families, the former
Stanford student reported.
"It was appalling," he exclaimed.
Distribution of foodstuffs and oth
er consumer goods is another sore
! situation in Russia. Though Mos
! cow is well supplied, he said, the
i villages and citie.s outside the capi
tal arc ill-stocked. He said in Mos
j cow you can buy 40 varieties of
bread, while in a village 15 miles
! distant you can buy only one vari
| ety, a sickening, coarse black bread.
The lack of good transportation
partly, explains the inequitable dis
tribution.
According to Stines, the lack of
1 good housing and sound distribution
has led of late to much grumbling
j on the part of many Russians. He
i described the peasants as being par
ticularly "resentful."
But, he pointed out, though most
people have a gripe, there is no hint
of revolt, in the Soviet. Union.
He characterized the people as
being "tremendously indifferent and
inert." Throughout Russia, he said,
j an astounding "lack of enthusiasm"

I can he noted on the part of most
Russians.
"That doesn't mean that the
people don't believe in Commu
nism," he pointed out. Most of
them, he declared, are loyal to the
Stalin regime.
He said that most Russians would
he unwilling to precipitate a war
against America and other Western
powers, but added that the.Russians
would fight if they were convinced
that the United States had launched
an attack. "The Russian people will
i always fight vigorously for their
j homeland," he observed.
That Amerira, moved bv terror,
mvjht kick off a full-seale war is
a frightening possibility, Stines
said.
Speaking of American foreign
i policy toward Russia, the former
State Department official (here
! «igned his government post in May,
1952), Stines said, "We've got to
I think of something far more posi-
I tivc."
With Western Europe now flex
ing new strength through its re
equipped and well-trained armies,
Stincs said it is time the West exert

! a little pressure "to worry the
| Kremlin."
He strongly urged that the
United States pep tip its radio
propaganda program beamed at
the Iron Curtain countries.
He said the current Voice of
America l.roadcasts were hide
ously dull and draw few listen
ers within Russia.
What we should do, he said, is to
"tune radio broadcast; to local sit—
| nations," citing local troubles and
inequities. Talk about the things
the people know instead of abstract
discussions of world peace, the vet
eran of Russian service insisted.
In that way, ho .said, we might be
able to fire dissent, to develop the
gripes which are currently bu/./.ing
about the vast Soviet countryside.
Stines now lives in Los Gatos, and
is planning to write about his expe
: riences in the Soviet Union. Before
i entering the State Department in
| 1945, Stines worked for the Redwood
City Tribune. Aside from Moscow,
he has served in Belgrade, Yugo
slavia, and in Guatemala for the
| State Department.
