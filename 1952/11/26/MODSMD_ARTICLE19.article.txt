# West Bloc Approves India Truce Plan; British-American Split Still Remains
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Nov. 25 (UP)—The 21 sponsors of the
West's Korean peace resolution decided unanimously today to
set aside their own plan and give priority treatment to India's truce
proposal.
However, Sir Percy Spender of Australia, chairman of the West-

ern group, said clarifications still
will be sought in India's plan for
repatriation of war prisoners.
Today's decision meant the Indian
resolution doubtless will be ap
proved by the United Nations Gen
eral Assembly, despite Russia's re
jection of it yesterday, if India
makes the clarifications.
It. still was far from certain, de
spite the procedural decision, that
British-American differences on th<;
substance of the Indian pian have
been bridged sufficiently to produce
harmony when it comes time for a
voting showdown — probably late
this week.
The United States has drawn up
a scries of concrete amendments
to the Indian resolution. An
American spokesman said flatly
that the U.S. will demand, as the
price for its voting support, a
clause setting a specific deadline
date by which all POW's refusing
to go home must he set free and
provision made for their future.
Britain was understood ready to
settle for much less—perhaps a sim
ple sentence saying, as Indian dele
gate V. K. Krishna Menon suggest
ed, that no prisoner may be held
captive indefinitely.
Spender's announcement nftcr
tonight's 50-minute session said the
21 Western sponsors had "unani
mously reached agreement that pri
ority in the voting" be given to In
dia's blueprint.
The decision presaged a rough
and-tumble procedural battle in
the Political Committee, since So
viet Foreign Minister Andrei V.
Vishinsky today announced rigid
opposition to giving the Indian
plan priority.
Following yesterday's blunt re
jection of the Indian resolution,
Vishinsky today insisted that a
vote must he taken on the five,
resolutions before the committee
in the order in which they were
put forward. India's would come
la-st after the U.S., Russian. Mexi
can, and Peruvian proposals.
