# Roses and Thorns
## 
### 
The roses this week go to:
Tom Peterson, who, aided by Alpha Phi
Omega, has begun plans for a shelter for Stan
ordites awaiting rides to the Village. This
shelter should fill a real need.
The Axe Society for lending man and woman
power to practically every important all-cam
pus event in recent weeks. Axe Society people
lelped out on High School day, the charity
rive, and the recent election. They have also
let up a speakers bureau to help high school
;tudents learn about Stanford.
The Board of Trustees for approving print
:hop equipment for the Daily. This will mean
setter quality, more efficiently produced pic
ures and advertisements for your newspaper.
Rally Committee and Cardinals for putting on
mother successful Big Game Week celebra
tion. Hally Com deserves a special pat on the
back for laboring long and hard over the card
stunts which the wind then proceeded to ren
der unusable.
The Class of '56, which after getting off to the
usual slow start, came through with a big and
successful bonfire.

Everyone who worked on Gaieties. Once
again we were amazed at the time and talent
which went into the annual variety show.

The one big and prickly bouquet of thorns
this week goes to every single apathetic person
who failed to vote in the second ASSU election.
