### DICK MANSFIELD 
At Stanford, all the boys admired A. Murray Flinglc
because he was such a good dancer. They watched
with wonder as A. Murray Flingle floated or spiralled
(or sometimes both) across the floor, a gorgeous coed
in his arms. You name the step—A. Murray Flingle
was out there in the middle of the floor, and showing
the way.
Flingle had no co-ordination to speak of. He had
no sense of rhythm. As far as that goes, he couldn't
tell one tune from another. His Basic Steo (You

think it will be like the Arthur
Murray Basic Step, don't you!
But his first name was Aggamem
non) was this: Five quick, furtive
darts to the left, a heavy lurch to
the light, kick the girl in the
shin, and spin full speed ahead
into the biggest tackle on the
football team and his date, a ro
bust pom-pom girl.
How did he get away with it?
Mingle had a glib line. lie had

self-assurance. He got a little smile on his face
and waltzed right through. The Flingle Basic Step
worked for him to a wait/., a foxtrot, or a samba.
For lite samba, he merely interspersed a few more
lurches into his series of furtive darts. For a bolero,
he paused slightly before the lurch.
And the coeds ate it up. It is general information
and a Law of Nature that Coeds Can Dance. If any
coed ever whimpered something barely audible about
"what step is this?" Flingle would, as if he hadn't
heard, say "Gad! How well I remember dancing this
;it the Tennis Club Ball irt Fairbanks! Guy Loinbardo
was playing . . ." Then he would guide the con

versation to Fairbanks and talk fast for fifteen sec
onds.
Once, A. Murray Flinglc almost got pinned by the
coed he was currently rassling. As the harpsichord
struck up a Viennese Waltz and Flingle lurched
smoothly into a potted palm, this coed, who happened
to be a very good dancer, said "My goodness! It's a
good thing Strauss can't see you now!"
"Good grief! I'm sorry," said Flingle, "I thought it
was a mazurka . . ." And with that little smile, he
guided her to the sidelines. Yes, Flinkle was glib.
He had to be glib. Lacking muscular co-ordina
tion, grace, or lightness of foot, he depended instead
on such verbal gambits as the Constructive Criti
cism of Someone else. "Poor old Gurgowicz," he
would say, "Look at him try to do this! I had a bit
of a struggle with it myself, at first . . ."
Flingle was a big man, and when the occasion pre
sented itself, he would merely lift the coed off the
floor and run several steps. This gave the impres
sion of speed and grace, although once a coed didn't
quite get the graceful part, and threw a left to the
jaw. Temporarily unable to keep up his glib line.
Flingle was foiled, and shortly staggered off the floor.
The girl eventually understood that Flingle had
merely been practicing*a quaint deception (she was
another good dancer) and she apologized and allowed
him to tramp her toes once more.
A. Murray Flinglc left us his principles of dancing,
when he left Stanford. You don't have to know how
to dance, said Flingle. You don't even have to think
you know how to dance. But you have to convey
the impression that you think you know how to dance.
Be confident. And never be apologetic. That's how
A. Murray Flingle, who didn't know how to dance,
became the best dancer at Stanford.

onds.
Once, A. Murray Flinglc almost got pinned by the
coed he was currently rassling. As the harpsichord
struck up a Viennese Waltz and Flingle lurched
smoothly into a potted palm, this coed, who happened
to be a very good dancer, said "My goodness! It's a
good thing Strauss can't see you now!"
"Good grief! I'm sorry," said Flingle, "I thought it
was a mazurka . . ." And with that little smile, he
guided her to the sidelines. Yes, Flinkle was glib.
He had to be glib. Lacking muscular co-ordina
tion, grace, or lightness of foot, he depended instead
on such verbal gambits as the Constructive Criti
cism of Someone else. "Poor old Gurgowicz," he
would say, "Look at him try to do this! I had a bit
of a struggle with it myself, at first . . ."
Flingle was a big man, and when the occasion pre
sented itself, he would merely lift the coed off the
floor and run several steps. This gave the impres
sion of speed and grace, although once a coed didn't
quite get the graceful part, and threw a left to the
jaw. Temporarily unable to keep up his glib line.
Flingle was foiled, and shortly staggered off the floor.
The girl eventually understood that Flingle had
merely been practicing*a quaint deception (she was
another good dancer) and she apologized and allowed
him to tramp her toes once more.
A. Murray Flinglc left us his principles of dancing,
when he left Stanford. You don't have to know how
to dance, said Flingle. You don't even have to think
you know how to dance. But you have to convey
the impression that you think you know how to dance.
Be confident. And never be apologetic. That's how
A. Murray Flingle, who didn't know how to dance,
became the best dancer at Stanford.

At Stanford, all the boys admired A. Murray Flinglc
because he was such a good dancer. They watched
with wonder as A. Murray Flingle floated or spiralled
(or sometimes both) across the floor, a gorgeous coed
in his arms. You name the step—A. Murray Flingle
was out there in the middle of the floor, and showing
the way.
Flingle had no co-ordination to speak of. He had
no sense of rhythm. As far as that goes, he couldn't
tell one tune from another. His Basic Steo (You

think it will be like the Arthur
Murray Basic Step, don't you!
But his first name was Aggamem
non) was this: Five quick, furtive
darts to the left, a heavy lurch to
the light, kick the girl in the
shin, and spin full speed ahead
into the biggest tackle on the
football team and his date, a ro
bust pom-pom girl.
How did he get away with it?
Mingle had a glib line. lie had

self-assurance. He got a little smile on his face
and waltzed right through. The Flingle Basic Step
worked for him to a wait/., a foxtrot, or a samba.
For lite samba, he merely interspersed a few more
lurches into his series of furtive darts. For a bolero,
he paused slightly before the lurch.
And the coeds ate it up. It is general information
and a Law of Nature that Coeds Can Dance. If any
coed ever whimpered something barely audible about
"what step is this?" Flingle would, as if he hadn't
heard, say "Gad! How well I remember dancing this
;it the Tennis Club Ball irt Fairbanks! Guy Loinbardo
was playing . . ." Then he would guide the con

versation to Fairbanks and talk fast for fifteen sec
onds.
