A Relative Standard
To the Editor:
In regards to the Editorial of Nov. 24. I agree with
he editors of the Daily when they say that the out
:ome of the vote on the liquor resolution was hypo
:ritieal—and I think that Stanford students should
•ot be fearful for the university's reputation if they
incert-ly believe that the liquor law should be rep
ealed Everyone should follow his conscience in this
latter.
On the other hand, the "well-everyone-else-does
it" altitude expressing a relative standard of moral
values which changes with the times is, I believe,
seriously wrong. The Daily states that "Any law
whirh does not find as its basis a prevailing attitude
l>y a majority of the people cannot possibly have a
sound realistic basis—." I disagree—if head-hunting
became a vogue in this country, I would not say that
it was "high time" to junk our moral standard which
says murder is wrong.
Theoretically 1 believe everyone should be allowed
to drink. Drinking is not immoral, but because of
immoral and dangerous (e.g. drunk driving) conse
quences it is practical to have a drinking age limit.
I am not here discussing what the age limit should
or should not be, but I would like to know if the edi
tors of the Daily go along with this me-too-ism of
changing moral values with the times. II they do not,
I think that they should clarify their position, if they
do, I can say only that I most wholeheartedly disagree.

(Kditor's note. The Daily editorial board did not
intend to endorse a completely relatively philosophy.
We lind that a society, in order to remain dynamic,
must change with time-r-and that this change does
not mean abandonment of basic values.)
