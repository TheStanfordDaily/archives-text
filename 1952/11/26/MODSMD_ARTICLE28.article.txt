# 'Want...Work Done'

To the Editor:
Who's kidding whom? The vote on the liquor res
olution does not mean, as you seem to believe, that
Stanford students do not want further discussion on
the liquor problem. Our choice was not that simple.
A resolution was presented embodying certain pro
posed changes in the present law; a "yes" vote would
have indicated approval of these changes. The "no"
vote indicated that Stanford students did not approve
of these particular changes, but does not mean that
Stanford students want no more discussion of the
problem. Exeom can not get an accurate expression of
vtudent opinion on the liquor problem by asking for
the students' opinion on a definite proposal.
The editors say that Kansas "waited G6 years to
correct their faulty law, but when they did act, they
acted intelligently." Stanford students were not sure
that the proposal was an intelligent step toward solv
ing the problem. Hence the "no" vote.
Stanford students want to spp more work done on

the liquor problem, but when we support changes in
the law, we want to have some conviction that the
proposed changes are of definite value.
