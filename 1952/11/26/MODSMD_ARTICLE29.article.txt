# 'We Don't Deserve...'

### 
To the Editor:
Just a few comments on the ridiculous editorial of,
Nov. 24, 1952. In the first place, the students did not
place themselves against discussion on the liquor
problem. Their vote was against advocating a re
duction in drinking age. if I remember correctly.
Secondly, just what source did the author use in
order to arrive at th<; conclusion that. "These regu
lations are contrary to the prevailing existing attitudes
of our society"? In view of the results of the voting
last Wednesday, the statement is subject to challenge
and severe criticism.
The philosophy incorporated into the statement
that "We believe it's high time we stopped thinking
we are so morally good when our performance is
so consistently inferior to our moral standards" was
rather shecking when one considers that American
tradition from the start has always set high stand
ards—always higher than attainable. Would the
author have us believe that our moral standards,
such as the Stanford Honor Code, should be re
duced because there are a few who won't try to live
lip to it?
Without question, we are human and not perfect;
but is that, any reason not to at least shoot for per
fection? According to this line of reasoning, since
everyone has at one time or another violated the
state motor vehicle code, either knowingly or other
wise, we should abolish the code.
The statement that, "We think it is pitiful that so
many Stanford students are afraid to put up their
hands and say Stanford favors a realistic proposal to
correct this .hypocritical situation," is a downright
insult to the Stanford student. It seems to me that we
are to believe that anyone who did not vote FOR the
proposal was "Afraid to hold up his hands." In other
words, the implication is that a NO vote was the vote
of a coward!
Perhaps the most insulting part of this editorial
is the closing paragraph, "Then let's see how the
students and their families and friends really feel"
—this smacks of a threat to me.
Just how does the author of this "masterpiece" ex
pect to "Win friends and influence people" with this
type of an intimidating attack? Certainly speaking
of our ability to enforce legislation, the integrity of
our faculty, the courage in opinion of our students,
and Stanford University in such terms is degrading
to the author himself. My purpose in writing this,
has not been to influence thought for or against this
proposal, but to reply to such an editorial.
Surely, we don't deserve such a tirade for holding
an opinion contrary to that of our editors.
