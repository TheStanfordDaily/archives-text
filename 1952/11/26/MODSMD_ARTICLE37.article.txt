## PRO AND CAHN No Grid Platoons for '53 Cards 
### 
Before football just becomes a memory, and perhaps the sooner that
occurs the better, we wish to bring to light a few thoughts Chuck Taylor
has expressed concerning that inevitable next year.
More important than anything is Taylor's staunch belief that the
Cards are finished using the platoon style of football. Says the mentor,
"'1 his season has taught us that the platoon system doesn't fit what we
have. I think we are through with it. The wax vvc operate our recruiting
system we'll never outman anyone. There may come a time when we're
fairly equal in men. But as of now. I can't see us ever putting a team
on the field like California's or USC's.
"So, we are going the other way, non-platoon and see what comes of
it. We'll have to,figure on playing it more wide open and trying (o win
games by out maneuvering or outsmarting the other clubs.
ft
"Therefore we have to concentrate on getting outstanding quarter
backs and passers and above average receivers."
And as far as the recruiting of players go, Stanford by apparently play
ing it square has taken a back seat to some of the PCC schools in getting
top notch players. But Taylor believes that the Pacific Coast Conference
meeting scheduled for the 7 to 11 of December "Might decide a lot of things
with regard to scholastic equality and recruiting." Such action would be
of great benefit to Stanford.
What about Bob Mathias coming back for another year considering he
will be around and does have the eligibility? Bob has said he won't be
available. And Mr. Taylor is not the type to high pressure Robert. In fact
Chuck has said, "It might be best for him not to play. He does not enjoy
the game to a point where he can do himself justice."
That's about it on the football front except for one more item. We notice
where Dick Gallagher has called it quits at Santa Clara. To us, coupled
with recent rumors that Santa Clara might drop football, this is an indica
tion that something is definitely in the wind; and if the Broncos clon't join
USF and St. Mary's on the sidelines next Fall we will be much surprised,
Mid if they do very saddened, lor the Broncos are one of the last strong
holds of Independent football in the area and certainly a fine opponent
each year.
Polo Team Worthy of \olc
And now to a sport that is way off the beaten track but one worthy of
attention. It seems that Stanford has a Polo team and apparently a fine
one. They have clippings a mile long of their trip last year to New York
and one to Mexico.
They tell us that the object of Polo is similar to that of soccer, trying
to get a willow ball the size of a baseball into goals at opposite ends of the
field. But the field is a bit bigger than what we are used to, being 300
yards long and 150 yards wide. This can't be covered by foot so the players
ride horses, and four horsemen make up a team and they gallop back and
forth on this vast playing area trying to score by placing the ball through
the goals. And the tough part seems to be in maneuvering the horse just
where it should be. That's the skill. The danger which is apparently es
sential if the game is to be exciting is the fact that two horses might want
to be in the same spot at the same time and also that galloping horses are
not always the safest when just riding them, let alone trying to hit a ball
with a mallet while your opponent is doing the same.
But all this is leading up to the fact that this week the Stanford Polo
team*is hosting some out of slate foes all of which should provide glorious
Thanksgiving entertainment for those destined to be on campus.
This afternoon the hoys ride against Arizona at 2:30. Friday they meet
Colorado at 2:30 and on Monday play Colorado again, this time at 1:30.
And all games are on the local polo field and in case you didn't know we
had one. it is located, all 315,000 sq. yds. of it, out past the football fields
and stretching to El Camino.

"Therefore we have to concentrate on getting outstanding quarter
backs and passers and above average receivers."
And as far as the recruiting of players go, Stanford by apparently play
ing it square has taken a back seat to some of the PCC schools in getting
top notch players. But Taylor believes that the Pacific Coast Conference
meeting scheduled for the 7 to 11 of December "Might decide a lot of things
with regard to scholastic equality and recruiting." Such action would be
of great benefit to Stanford.
What about Bob Mathias coming back for another year considering he
will be around and does have the eligibility? Bob has said he won't be
available. And Mr. Taylor is not the type to high pressure Robert. In fact
Chuck has said, "It might be best for him not to play. He does not enjoy
the game to a point where he can do himself justice."
That's about it on the football front except for one more item. We notice
where Dick Gallagher has called it quits at Santa Clara. To us, coupled
with recent rumors that Santa Clara might drop football, this is an indica
tion that something is definitely in the wind; and if the Broncos clon't join
USF and St. Mary's on the sidelines next Fall we will be much surprised,
Mid if they do very saddened, lor the Broncos are one of the last strong
holds of Independent football in the area and certainly a fine opponent
each year.
Polo Team Worthy of \olc
And now to a sport that is way off the beaten track but one worthy of
attention. It seems that Stanford has a Polo team and apparently a fine
one. They have clippings a mile long of their trip last year to New York
and one to Mexico.
They tell us that the object of Polo is similar to that of soccer, trying
to get a willow ball the size of a baseball into goals at opposite ends of the
field. But the field is a bit bigger than what we are used to, being 300
yards long and 150 yards wide. This can't be covered by foot so the players
ride horses, and four horsemen make up a team and they gallop back and
forth on this vast playing area trying to score by placing the ball through
the goals. And the tough part seems to be in maneuvering the horse just
where it should be. That's the skill. The danger which is apparently es
sential if the game is to be exciting is the fact that two horses might want
to be in the same spot at the same time and also that galloping horses are
not always the safest when just riding them, let alone trying to hit a ball
with a mallet while your opponent is doing the same.
But all this is leading up to the fact that this week the Stanford Polo
team*is hosting some out of slate foes all of which should provide glorious
Thanksgiving entertainment for those destined to be on campus.
This afternoon the hoys ride against Arizona at 2:30. Friday they meet
Colorado at 2:30 and on Monday play Colorado again, this time at 1:30.
And all games are on the local polo field and in case you didn't know we
had one. it is located, all 315,000 sq. yds. of it, out past the football fields
and stretching to El Camino.
Before football just becomes a memory, and perhaps the sooner that
occurs the better, we wish to bring to light a few thoughts Chuck Taylor
has expressed concerning that inevitable next year.
More important than anything is Taylor's staunch belief that the
Cards are finished using the platoon style of football. Says the mentor,
"'1 his season has taught us that the platoon system doesn't fit what we
have. I think we are through with it. The wax vvc operate our recruiting
system we'll never outman anyone. There may come a time when we're
fairly equal in men. But as of now. I can't see us ever putting a team
on the field like California's or USC's.
"So, we are going the other way, non-platoon and see what comes of
it. We'll have to,figure on playing it more wide open and trying (o win
games by out maneuvering or outsmarting the other clubs.
