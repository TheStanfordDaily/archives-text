# TUESDAY SPEAKER SAYS
## 'Polar Maps Show True Picture of Modren World' 
### BARBARA TUERK 
"If our maps are faulty, our
reasoning will be faulty, too,"
Dr. Joseph Williams of the Stan
ford Geography Department told
last night's Tuesday Series au
dience.
Speaking in Memorial Audito
rium, the eminent cartographer sug
gested that polar maps may be the
solution to our map-drawing diffi
culties.
' Only when we are accustomed to
seeing the North Pole at the center
of the map, can we understand the
relationship of our country with
the rest of the world," he said.
The polar maps, he pointed out,
show the USSR and the U.S. bal
ancing each other on opposite
sides of the globe; the importance
of Alaska, Greenland, and Ice-
Inad; and the real significance of
the one-world concept.
"Nine-tenths of the world's popu
lation live in the .Northern Hemi
sphere," Dr. Williams stressed. "A
map with the North Pole in the
center and extending" as far as the
equator would include all the great
population centers of North Amer

ica, Europe, and Asia. Moreover,
distance and direction would be
completely accurate."
Dr. Williams, a recent winner of
a National Geographical Society
award, also stressed the relation
ship between man's transporta
tion methods and his map needs.
"Now in the air age," he said, "we
need maps that will show air dis
tances. Before, land and sea maps
were enough."
Among the maps he described
with the aid of slides were:
1. An early Chinese map showing
the early idea of a flat disc earth
completely surrounded by ocean.
2. A British medieval map pic
turing the sea as green, the rivers as
blue, and the Red Sea as red.
3. Dutch maps from the "Golden
Age of Cartography," the sixteenth
century, featuring detailed sketches
of the wxlled fortifications of Dutch
towns.
4. Contemporary relief maps il
lustrating the present controversies
over the best methods of indicating
the third dimension. Among the last
maps was one drawn by Dr. Wil
liams, who is now planning to spend
spring quarter in Europe studying
map coloring.

tion methods and his map needs.
"Now in the air age," he said, "we
need maps that will show air dis
tances. Before, land and sea maps
were enough."
Among the maps he described
with the aid of slides were:
1. An early Chinese map showing
the early idea of a flat disc earth
completely surrounded by ocean.
2. A British medieval map pic
turing the sea as green, the rivers as
blue, and the Red Sea as red.
3. Dutch maps from the "Golden
Age of Cartography," the sixteenth
century, featuring detailed sketches
of the wxlled fortifications of Dutch
towns.
4. Contemporary relief maps il
lustrating the present controversies
over the best methods of indicating
the third dimension. Among the last
maps was one drawn by Dr. Wil
liams, who is now planning to spend
spring quarter in Europe studying
map coloring.
"If our maps are faulty, our
reasoning will be faulty, too,"
Dr. Joseph Williams of the Stan
ford Geography Department told
last night's Tuesday Series au
dience.
Speaking in Memorial Audito
rium, the eminent cartographer sug
gested that polar maps may be the
solution to our map-drawing diffi
culties.
' Only when we are accustomed to
seeing the North Pole at the center
of the map, can we understand the
relationship of our country with
the rest of the world," he said.
The polar maps, he pointed out,
show the USSR and the U.S. bal
ancing each other on opposite
sides of the globe; the importance
of Alaska, Greenland, and Ice-
Inad; and the real significance of
the one-world concept.
"Nine-tenths of the world's popu
lation live in the .Northern Hemi
sphere," Dr. Williams stressed. "A
map with the North Pole in the
center and extending" as far as the
equator would include all the great
population centers of North Amer

ica, Europe, and Asia. Moreover,
distance and direction would be
completely accurate."
Dr. Williams, a recent winner of
a National Geographical Society
award, also stressed the relation
ship between man's transporta
tion methods and his map needs.
"Now in the air age," he said, "we
need maps that will show air dis
tances. Before, land and sea maps
were enough."
