# KZSU: Jazz ... to Culture
## 
### RUTH WOLPE 
Four hours a night, six nights
a week, KZSU is on the air. For
each of these four hours the staff
i spends many hours of work and
j planning. And when they are
finished, their product is not a
tangible one, but one that has
disappeared by the time the
program has ended.
11 The programming schedule is set
I up with soft music, interviews, and
I news during the earlier part of the
: evening, followed by jazz and vari
! ety shows later.
KZSU does not seek to imitate
[ the large networks in its program
; ming; it seeks to program what the
I networks can't—Stanford. At the
I same time, it tries to give its stall
j members experience in all kinds of
programs.
"We feel that the be:;t programs
that KZSU has to ofTer are World
wide Datelines and Let's Look at
Sports, both sponsored by Lucky
I Strike and presented from Sunday
through Friday at 7:45 and 10:15, j
respectively," said Joyce Kern, pro
| gram director of KZSU. "These
! programs are of high production
I quality and offer a real news serv
j ice to the campus."
