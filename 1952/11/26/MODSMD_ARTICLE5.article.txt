# Student-Professor Debate Set for Monday Night
## 
### 
"Intellectual and Academic Freedom" will be the subject of a
discussion debate among three Stanford professors and three stu
dents Monday night at 7:30 in Cubberley Auditorium.
Ray N. Faulkner, Associate Dean of Humanities and Sciences;
John P. Troxell, Director of the Division of Industrial Relations of

the Graduate School of Business;
and Virgil K. Whitakcr, Dean of the
English Department, will represent
different faculty views.
Presenting contrasting opinions
for the students will be Joyce Bal
lantine, president of the Cap and
Gown Society; Arnold Gold, chair
man of the Student-Faculty Politi
cal Committee; and Elizabeth Gon
ser, representing the Debate Soci
ety, sponsors of the event.
One of the main issues for dis
cussion, according to Harvey Wag
ner, student moderator of the
panel, is just how active a role
students and facultv should play
in expressing their intellectual
and academic freedom. The pro
fessors as well as the students arc
divided on this issue.
The discussion will extend to na
tional as well as to local and state
issues of intellectual freedom. The
merit of "anti-subversive" methods
such as Senator McCarthy's and the
enforced signing of loyalty oaths
will be debated.
Academic freedom, or the right
to teach and to be taught the
truth, concerns students as well as
faculty members. Everyone is in
vited to attend the hour-long de
bate and to join in a question pe
riod which will follow the dis
cussion.
