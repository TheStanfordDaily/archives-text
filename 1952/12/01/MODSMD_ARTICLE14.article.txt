# Lamb Honored By Award For Physics Study
## 
### 
Dr. Willis E. Lamb, Jr., Stanford
professor of physics, is one of three
leading American physicists who
have been awarded the Rumford
Medal by the American Academy of
Arts ancl Sciences, it was announced
yesterday.
The awards, which were made
known by Edwin H. Land, president
of the Academy, are for outstanding
contributions in the field of boat
and light. Professor Lamb was hon
ored for his studies of the atomic
hydrogen spectrum.
This is the second major award
to be won by a Stanford professor
of physics within a month. Dr.
Felix Blooh was announced Nov. ti
as the winner of the Nobel Prize
in physics.
Dr. Lamb will receive the Hum-,
ford medal at Boston during a sci
entific symposium March 26 -28
sponsored by the Academy. The
current winners and the 19 living
previous medalists are to present
discussions of their work.
Dr. Lamb joined the Stanford fac
ulty as professor of physics in 1951,
coming from Columbia University.
In addition to his teaching, he is en
gaged in research in microwave
atomic spectroscopy.
J .ate in 1947, Dr. Lamb attracted
(he attention of the scientific
world with his discovery of the
"Lamb shift." It established a de
viation from a previously accept
ed formula for the fine structure
of hydrogen md measured the de
viation precisely.
During World War 11, as a staff
member of the Columbia Radiation
Laboratory, he specialized in the
development of magnetrons for the
generation of high - power micro
wave radar pul e.s.
