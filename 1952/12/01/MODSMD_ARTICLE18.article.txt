lowing manner: a professor or a
student will first present back
ground material and clarifications,
then the entire panel will discuss
each question.
Harvey Wagner, student modera
tor of the panel, said that the wide
spread national growth of restric
tions on intellectual and academic
freedom be the major topic.
Discussion of such local prob
lems as the academic loyalty oath,

candidates, and academic freedom
here at Stanford will not be neg
lected, he added.
On the state scene, the panel will
discuss the question, "Is there a
growing threat, to intellectual an r l
academic freedom in California?"
Miss Gonser will speak of the im
plications of the UNESCO contro
versy in Los Angeles this summer.
Gold will give the background his
tory of loyalty oath developments
and the passage of Proposition 6.
Miss Gonser, a history major who
studied in Europe last summer, will
also compare the degrees of academ
ic freedom in American and Euro
pean universities.
Formal discussion will conclude
with the topic, "What, can a Stan
ford student do (as an individual
and in a group) to promote and pro
tect intellectual and academic free
dom?"
The program will conculde with
a unique audience question period
in which the moderator will direct
panelists of opposing views to re
ply to the same question.
