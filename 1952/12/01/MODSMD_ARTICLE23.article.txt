### PETE GROTHE 
I am sad. " i
1 am sad because Stanford lost Ihe Dig Game.
I am sad because a test just threw me for a 15-yard
lost;.
I am sad because USC is going to the Rose Bowl.
1 am sad because finals are rearing their ugly beads
again.
1 am sad.
But J will proceed with this hull session anyway,
although it is apt to be sad.
First, comes an item from Encina. Harry Havilio,
* ponsor, soccer star, and good guy, is a generous soul,
lit' i.s so generous that he lends his car to anyone who

wants to borrow it. It seems that
ihe people who have driven
Harry's car have accumulated
tight parking tickets. Chief Gordy
Davis, the poor man's Dick Tracy,
is ltdw prodding Havilio's gener
< .si ty fur $ IU.
Ajid this makes Harry very sad.
Dorothy Dodge, (he queen
bee of (he Daily, has gone on
i lure spirited crusade* this fall.
The first was to elect Steven-

son, the second to bring home the Axe, and the third
to pass the liquor resolution. All three have been
about as successful as a of milk at a Deke
party.

And this makes Dorothy very *ad.
Word comes thai a Stanford student has a gardener
at his home in the Middle West whom he never par
ticularly cared for, and he never made any bones
about it. The unliked, unlikable gardener was re
cently made chairman of ihe Stanford student's draft
hoard.
And this makes the student very sad.
Win Griffith, Daily reporter, was standing in the
Daily shack when a stranger came in and button
holed him. "Say," the stranger said, "could you tell
me where the Stanford Alpine Club meets? I am an
alpiner from Harvard."
After giving him instructions, Griffith asked,
"Say, have you ever heard of Harvard alpiner John
Sack, author of "The Butcher?"
Then five minutes of raves broken by (he short
reply: "I am John Sack."
And (his made Win very sad. or at least em
barrassed.
Finally comes the item about a Stanford student
who rode a horse out to Hossotti's on Olympic Day.
Bug-eyed Stanlordites watched him actually ride the
hrfrse into the building and tip to the bar. The
mounted student, who, most testify, was sober, or
dered, "Two beers, one for me and one for my horse,"
"How old isthe horse?" queried the bar tender.
"Seven."
"I'm sorry, no beer for horses under 21,"
And this made Ihe horse very .sail.
