It seems to me to be a part of ordinary courtesy to

Editor's Note: Writer Bouvart and many other
students may be interested in learning that in (he
first vote held on the liquor resolution, voided be
cause of a shortage of ballots, Resolution 1 (the
Liquor Resolution) was supported by a majority
of the voters. It was not the required three-fourths
majority necessary to pass, but it was favored by
slightly more, than 50 per cent of the 4,500 students
vvlio voted.
In the same election however, Resolution II (sub
mitting the first resolution to the legislature) was
defeated by more than 50 per cent of the voters.
