# Daily 'Missed the Point’
## 
### 
To the Fditor:
We strongly object to the front page editorial in
Monday's Daily, condemning the students' rejection
of the Liquor Resolution. We feel that the Daily
missed the point in saying that the only reason the
resolution was defeated was because the students did
not leel that the present law was unrealistic. While
this thought may have drawn some of the "No"
votes, we think that there is another even more im
portant reason why many people voted against the
idea— a reason which the Daily editorial did not even
consider. We voted "No," not because we think that
the present law is realistic or good, but rather because
we felt that the resolution, if taken seriously, was
wor;.e. It incorporated many good ideas but we, and
undoubtedly others, objected lo the "18-year-old"
provision. 11 the age is lowered to 18 thtjre will be
included, in addition to many college freshmen, a great
number of high school students who, we feel, are not
mature enough to take thls responsibility. Think back
to your own high school days and judge for yourself.
The Daily stated that the students "put themselves
against * proposal which would have instigated fur
iher discussion on the liquor problem." This is cer
tainly Uue, but is invalid as an argument. It is much
the same us saying that one should vote for a law
endorsing communism so that "further discussion"
might be instigated on socialism. We certainly agree
'hat there should be much further discussion on the
liquor problem, but we do not think that further
'tisi ussion should be instigated by having Stanford
• tudents back a proposition which, in itself, is not
.1 completely accurate statement of their feelings.
A law setting the minimum age at nineteen would

also have its disadvantages, but would be preferable
to the present clearly unrealistic one. Such a pro
posal would legalize most college-age drinking, which
is the primary stumbling block of the present law.
We, and we believe many of the others who voted
"No," would be enthusiastic "Yes" men if the 18-
year-old provision were changed.
