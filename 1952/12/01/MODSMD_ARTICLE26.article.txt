# Present Law ..‘Satisfactory’
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Since the majority of the opinion at this fraternity
concerning your "sour grapes" editorial on the liquor
resolution is the same as that expressed last week by
the majority of the student body, it might be well
to explain to you our "irrational" atttiude.
We believe that California's liquor law is satis
factory as it stands, and is better than the Stanford
resolution or than any other proposed change of
which we have yet heard.
We believe that most eighteen-year-olds, and par
ticularly those still in high school, are' not mature
enough to drink; we believe that the law does act as
a deterrent to many who would otherwise be drink
ing—particularly in high school, and we believe that—
again, particularly on these levels it is enforced
much more than the Daily editorial board seems to
believe.
We also feel that the Daily is basically wrong in
assuming that a law is not "intelligent" unless it
can be stringently enforced. And this is the only
argument in Nov. 24th's editorial. A law is tailored
to meet a certain problem, and its intelligence should
lie measured by seeing how well it meets that prob
lem, rather than by seeing how it goes about it. If
Stanford were to sponsor a resolution calling for
the raising of all speed limits by ten miles per hour,
this would be more apparent.
This law serves to make the period 18-21 a pro
bationary period with respect to alcohol. If everyone
started to drink legally at any given age, as the Daily
proposes that they should, their inability to handle
the liquor—and the inability of the Law to handle
them—would be chaotic. Under the present law, if
anyone under 21 is stopped or arrested while under
the influence of alcohol, he is subject to severe pen
alties. Minors know this, and we contend that they
do not commit anti-social acts, legal or illegal, which
might lead to their apprehension—precisely because
they know that there is a liquor law which can be
used against them. Because of the liquor law, they
learn to handle their liquor, and when they come of
age, and the law is no longer a deterrent, they have
learned how to drink intelligently and have formed
good drinking habits.
Now about the Stanford resolution. One of my
friends tells me (hat a similar law was passed in a
town close to his own. And the effect was to bring
about 15-year-old drinking oil a large scale. If (he
majority of seniors in high school can legally buy
liquor, and drink, won't the rest of the seniors and
their dates drink too? And if junior girls who go
out with seniors drink, won't junior boys? And so
on down to the freshmen who are always trying to
lie like the upper classmen anyway. At such a time,
we can imagine the Daily start resurrecting this
editorial in favor of a 15-year-old drinking a&e.
It would be just as reasonable.
In summary: (!) the law is a statement of a desir
able public policy, reflecting the prevailing attitude ol
the majority; (2) it is enforced adequately where
most needed; (3) it serves to solve the problem of
young people drinking by creating a probationary
period in which minors can learn to drink intelli
gently; and (4) alternative solutions, and specifically
the Stanford resolution, are unsatisfactory. This is
the "warped reasoning" by which I voted against the
liquor resolution.
