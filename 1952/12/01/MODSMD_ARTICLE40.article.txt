Dick Hyland Blasts Stanford Again
Once again Mr. Dick Hyland, who scribbles for the Los Angeles Times, 1
, come out with an attack on his Alma Mater, Stanford. It was early
11 lis year alter the Indians dropped the Rose Bowl, that the former Stanford
rid star, blasted the Indians because he saw them "training" on malted
milk shakes and such gorging was bad for lads who were about to meet
the likes of Illinois.
This year the malted milks have heen forgotten and Hyland comes
ii|> with a new one, simply that the plavers "are hack on the don't care,
so-what, won't work path" and cautions all not to he surprised if "Stan
lont is never again given consideration as potential western champions
hut rather becomes a door mat, a pigeon, and a set up."
The important thing is not the losses, Hyland points out but rather that
the players accept defeat with a so what attitude. And it's important he
adds when Chuck Taylor states that the problem today is to make football
inn for players.
Hyland stresses that when new coaches hit the Farm they shake up
he lethargy that has formed and in many cases end up chayipions on
their first try. He points out that Taylor did this for three quarters of his
first year until the players fell back to a don't care so-what, won't work
path. Hyland doesn't like this approach.
And the southern writer concludes, "Superior students these Stanfords, !
willing to accept defeat. The league is getting to be too tough for them.
The Indians cannot be changing coaches every year just to shake the play
ers into working."*
And our comment? We are not at all impressed with Hyland's interpre
tation. We do feel that for some reason he is quite bitter at his old school,
possibly he bets on us in Big Games, and that any straw in the wind he j
.sadistically grasps at in hopes of heaping ridicule upon us, or perhaps as I
it scrap to build a column.
We admit, and no one has ever denied that Stanford as a University
does not recruit or take its football as seriously as USC, California and
others. Hut to those footballers who are admitted to Stanford because
they are primarily students, football is a seriotis business, one which they
give over 20 bonis a week to partake in. And they like to win, otherwise
they wouldn't be out there. And they work hard to win. But they are
also wise enough to know that they can't win them all, and the ones they j
lose, are spilt milk, and the thing to do is to look ahead, not behind.
What Stanford footballers lack in ability, which is often a great deal,
they make up for in spirit, fight and try. If they didn't compensate in this
uanner for a lack of ability Stanford's overall grid picture would be a
darker one, and Chuck Taylor would never have a two year record of
14 wins and seven losses.
And is Stanford destined to be a doormat? We hardly think so. No team !
can win them all, year after year. Football success runs in cycles. The
southern teams, USC and UCLA are now in power. Previously, for three
years it was California, last year it was Stanford. At times it has been one
Mil' the Northern schools.
All schools come up with a good year when they get the material, good
fortune, and coaching. That combination is often tough to piece together,
but is essential to a championship year. Two of the components won't
make a champion, it takes all three and again one of these years Stanford
will get two, material and good fortune to go with the third which is «!
present, good coaching, and Stanford will be Champions again. We can't
do it every year, neither can anyone else.
Familiar Figure to lie Missing
~ c?

When Stanford opens its cage season toniyht, a
familiar figure will be missing. For three years
Fritz Fenster has been playing Stanford basketball.
He has never been a star. He has never been a
first stringer with the exception of his freshman
year when he co-captained the yearlings. He has
seen little varsity action.
Bui Fritz has been out to practice for three
and a half long years. When healthy he has made
the traveling squad. But a knee injured while
playing high school football, seldom allowed the
San Franciscan the full use of his leg. Two years
ago he missed a trip East with the squad when his
knee went out two days before departure. He has

missed important games, important chances. And after two operations in
successive summers, and an attempt at strengthening the knee this past
summer doctors made Fritz turn in his suit Saturday. He was not going
to he first string this year, just about third guard. But to lose Fritz is not
tu lose a man on whose shoulders Stanford's success rests, but rather to
lose ;i spirit, and a will to win.

playing high school football, seldom allowed the
San Franciscan the full use of his leg. Two years
ago he missed a trip East with the squad when his
knee went out two days before departure. He has

missed important games, important chances. And after two operations in
successive summers, and an attempt at strengthening the knee this past
summer doctors made Fritz turn in his suit Saturday. He was not going
to he first string this year, just about third guard. But to lose Fritz is not
tu lose a man on whose shoulders Stanford's success rests, but rather to
lose ;i spirit, and a will to win.

Dick Hyland Blasts Stanford Again
Once again Mr. Dick Hyland, who scribbles for the Los Angeles Times, 1
, come out with an attack on his Alma Mater, Stanford. It was early
11 lis year alter the Indians dropped the Rose Bowl, that the former Stanford
rid star, blasted the Indians because he saw them "training" on malted
milk shakes and such gorging was bad for lads who were about to meet
the likes of Illinois.
This year the malted milks have heen forgotten and Hyland comes
ii|> with a new one, simply that the plavers "are hack on the don't care,
so-what, won't work path" and cautions all not to he surprised if "Stan
lont is never again given consideration as potential western champions
hut rather becomes a door mat, a pigeon, and a set up."
The important thing is not the losses, Hyland points out but rather that
the players accept defeat with a so what attitude. And it's important he
adds when Chuck Taylor states that the problem today is to make football
inn for players.
Hyland stresses that when new coaches hit the Farm they shake up
he lethargy that has formed and in many cases end up chayipions on
their first try. He points out that Taylor did this for three quarters of his
first year until the players fell back to a don't care so-what, won't work
path. Hyland doesn't like this approach.
And the southern writer concludes, "Superior students these Stanfords, !
willing to accept defeat. The league is getting to be too tough for them.
The Indians cannot be changing coaches every year just to shake the play
ers into working."*
And our comment? We are not at all impressed with Hyland's interpre
tation. We do feel that for some reason he is quite bitter at his old school,
possibly he bets on us in Big Games, and that any straw in the wind he j
.sadistically grasps at in hopes of heaping ridicule upon us, or perhaps as I
it scrap to build a column.
We admit, and no one has ever denied that Stanford as a University
does not recruit or take its football as seriously as USC, California and
others. Hut to those footballers who are admitted to Stanford because
they are primarily students, football is a seriotis business, one which they
give over 20 bonis a week to partake in. And they like to win, otherwise
they wouldn't be out there. And they work hard to win. But they are
also wise enough to know that they can't win them all, and the ones they j
lose, are spilt milk, and the thing to do is to look ahead, not behind.
What Stanford footballers lack in ability, which is often a great deal,
they make up for in spirit, fight and try. If they didn't compensate in this
uanner for a lack of ability Stanford's overall grid picture would be a
darker one, and Chuck Taylor would never have a two year record of
14 wins and seven losses.
And is Stanford destined to be a doormat? We hardly think so. No team !
can win them all, year after year. Football success runs in cycles. The
southern teams, USC and UCLA are now in power. Previously, for three
years it was California, last year it was Stanford. At times it has been one
Mil' the Northern schools.
All schools come up with a good year when they get the material, good
fortune, and coaching. That combination is often tough to piece together,
but is essential to a championship year. Two of the components won't
make a champion, it takes all three and again one of these years Stanford
will get two, material and good fortune to go with the third which is «!
present, good coaching, and Stanford will be Champions again. We can't
do it every year, neither can anyone else.
Familiar Figure to lie Missing

When Stanford opens its cage season toniyht, a
familiar figure will be missing. For three years
Fritz Fenster has been playing Stanford basketball.
He has never been a star. He has never been a
first stringer with the exception of his freshman
year when he co-captained the yearlings. He has
seen little varsity action.

present, good coaching, and Stanford will be Champions again. We can't
do it every year, neither can anyone else.
Familiar Figure to lie Missing
~ c?

When Stanford opens its cage season toniyht, a
familiar figure will be missing. For three years
Fritz Fenster has been playing Stanford basketball.
He has never been a star. He has never been a
first stringer with the exception of his freshman
year when he co-captained the yearlings. He has
seen little varsity action.
Bui Fritz has been out to practice for three
and a half long years. When healthy he has made
the traveling squad. But a knee injured while
playing high school football, seldom allowed the
San Franciscan the full use of his leg. Two years
ago he missed a trip East with the squad when his
knee went out two days before departure. He has

missed important games, important chances. And after two operations in
successive summers, and an attempt at strengthening the knee this past
summer doctors made Fritz turn in his suit Saturday. He was not going
to he first string this year, just about third guard. But to lose Fritz is not
tu lose a man on whose shoulders Stanford's success rests, but rather to
lose ;i spirit, and a will to win.

Dick Hyland Blasts Stanford Again
Once again Mr. Dick Hyland, who scribbles for the Los Angeles Times, 1
, come out with an attack on his Alma Mater, Stanford. It was early
11 lis year alter the Indians dropped the Rose Bowl, that the former Stanford
rid star, blasted the Indians because he saw them "training" on malted
milk shakes and such gorging was bad for lads who were about to meet
the likes of Illinois.
This year the malted milks have heen forgotten and Hyland comes
ii|> with a new one, simply that the plavers "are hack on the don't care,
so-what, won't work path" and cautions all not to he surprised if "Stan
lont is never again given consideration as potential western champions
hut rather becomes a door mat, a pigeon, and a set up."
The important thing is not the losses, Hyland points out but rather that
the players accept defeat with a so what attitude. And it's important he
adds when Chuck Taylor states that the problem today is to make football
inn for players.
Hyland stresses that when new coaches hit the Farm they shake up
he lethargy that has formed and in many cases end up chayipions on
their first try. He points out that Taylor did this for three quarters of his
first year until the players fell back to a don't care so-what, won't work
path. Hyland doesn't like this approach.
And the southern writer concludes, "Superior students these Stanfords, !
willing to accept defeat. The league is getting to be too tough for them.
The Indians cannot be changing coaches every year just to shake the play
ers into working."*
And our comment? We are not at all impressed with Hyland's interpre
tation. We do feel that for some reason he is quite bitter at his old school,
possibly he bets on us in Big Games, and that any straw in the wind he j
.sadistically grasps at in hopes of heaping ridicule upon us, or perhaps as I
it scrap to build a column.
We admit, and no one has ever denied that Stanford as a University
does not recruit or take its football as seriously as USC, California and
others. Hut to those footballers who are admitted to Stanford because
they are primarily students, football is a seriotis business, one which they
give over 20 bonis a week to partake in. And they like to win, otherwise
they wouldn't be out there. And they work hard to win. But they are
also wise enough to know that they can't win them all, and the ones they j
lose, are spilt milk, and the thing to do is to look ahead, not behind.
What Stanford footballers lack in ability, which is often a great deal,
they make up for in spirit, fight and try. If they didn't compensate in this
uanner for a lack of ability Stanford's overall grid picture would be a
darker one, and Chuck Taylor would never have a two year record of
14 wins and seven losses.
And is Stanford destined to be a doormat? We hardly think so. No team !
can win them all, year after year. Football success runs in cycles. The
southern teams, USC and UCLA are now in power. Previously, for three
years it was California, last year it was Stanford. At times it has been one
Mil' the Northern schools.
All schools come up with a good year when they get the material, good
fortune, and coaching. That combination is often tough to piece together,
but is essential to a championship year. Two of the components won't
make a champion, it takes all three and again one of these years Stanford
will get two, material and good fortune to go with the third which is «!
present, good coaching, and Stanford will be Champions again. We can't
do it every year, neither can anyone else.
