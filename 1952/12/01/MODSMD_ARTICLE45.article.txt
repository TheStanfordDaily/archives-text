## Plant and Equipment Design and the Engineer 
### 
At Du Pont, men with many types of training trans
late laboratory developments into full-scale production

Among the most interesting fields for
engineers at Du Pont is the design of
plants and equipment.
It takes ingenuity of a high order
to translate a small-scale laboratory
operation into all-out commerical
production. Design engineers cannot
always use purchasable equipment
to scale up research findings, even
with considerable adaption. About
half of the time at Du Pont, entirely
new equipment must be designed be
cause of the novelty of the process
developed by research.
For example, a number of unusual
problems were involved in designing
the equipment and plant for a process
in which hexamethylenediamine, one
of the intermediates for nylon, is
made from furfural, derived from
such agricultural by-products as
corncobs and hulls of cottonseed,
and rice.

In this conversion, these steps are in
volved:
C4H3OCHO Heo> C4H4O
furfural catalyst forcm
2H2 C4H8O
tetrahydrofuran
2HC1 C1(CH 2 )4 CI
dichlorobutane
2NaCN NC(CH2)4 CN
' adiponitrile
* H2 w H 2 N(CH2>6 NH2
hexamethylenediamine
Here are some of the special problems that
were encountered:
1. Design of equipment with close
temperature control for converting fur
fural to furan. The design finally settled
on employs a large number of tubes con
taining u catalyst, with a coolant circu
lated around them. Special sequence

timers were devised for operation of t lie
valves controlling production and re
generation cycles.
2. Design of high-pressure agitated
autoclaves for the hydrogenation of
furan to tetrahydrofuran.
3. Selection of corrosion-resistant
equipment for the hydrochlorination of
tetrahydrofuran to dichlorohutane at
high temperatures.
4. Design of a unique five-step distil
lation train to obtain high-grade adi
ponitrile without trace impurities.
Although most of these problems
involve a great deal of chemical en
gineering, also needed on the design
ing team were mechanical, electrical,
civil, metallurgical and industrial en
gineers. Thusdesign workat Du Pont
Is open to men with many types of
training, and there is abundant op
portunity for all.
