# Noted Economist Fears Threat Of Militarism in This Country
## 
### BARBARA TUERK 
Tall, grey-haired Theodore John Kreps looks mild as ho stands
before his classes waving his glasses to illustrate a point.
But in the 22 years he has been teaching business economics in
Stanford's Graduate School of Business, he has earned a solid
reputation as the University's favorite debunker.

And at the same time in his many
; positions in Washington — working
on the NRA, OPA, Board of Eco
nomic Warfare, and most recently
as staff director of the 1950 Joint
Committee on the Economic Report
in 1950—Dr. Kreps has earned- a
j national reputation as a crusading
j liberal economist.
Students and politicians alike
have learned that the mild-looking
Dr. Kreps is anything btit mild when
| he lashes out against the "suckers"
or the "arrogant idiots" of the busi
ness and political worlds.
Right now. the noted economist
is more worried about the political
threat of militarism in our coun
try than about any economic de
pression or recession in the oiling.

The recent election, he fears,
showed a definite trend toward the
"garrison police state, with its
purges and loyalty oaths."
Even now. he said, civil servants
are leaving Washington at the rate
of 50.000 a week.
"The lack of civilian .supremacy ; s
not a uniquely Republican danger,"
Dr. Kreps admitted. "But just ask
any foreign student how Europeans
feel about a general in the White
House with a cabinet full of gen
erals and an H-bomb in cach
hand."
"Remember," lie pointed out.
"right now, two-thirds of all your
bureaucrats are civilians attached
to the military. And this will get
worse in the next few years."
When heading up the Joint Com
mittee on the Economic Report, Dr.

I Kreps strongly favored a big cut in
j military spending.
Now as then lie insists, "Wo ought
to keep military spending below $50
billion, to got efficient military out
put and to avoid inflation."
Militarism will continue to be our
worst danger for the next 10 or 15
years at least. Dr. Kreps believes,
basing his prediction on the assump-
I tion of more Koreas, but no "hot
war" for at least that long.
"The Russians are winning the
ideological warfare," he warned.
"We're falling into their trap.
F.ven now they're iiist eliout ready
j to throw our soldiers out of Great
1 Jtritain."
Dr. Krcps is not at all worried
about the dangers of a depression.
"The Democrats have made the
economy so .strong that not even an
Eisenhower can wreck it,"the .1048
Democratic Presidential elector
jested.
"Seriously, though," he continued,
"our guards arc up. Depressions arc
man-made and just as preventable
as smallpox. The Republicans sim
ply would have to act against an
other one or disband. They couldn't
face a 'They Did It Again' slogan."
Dr. Kreps does expect to see the
new government administration
take all controls off prices and
wages and excess profits. "They
| have to he renewed," he ex
plained. "And can you imagine
Taft and his friends renewing
them?"
Like most recent governments, the
new administration and legislature
will include several of Dr. Kreps'
own students, among them Massa
chusetts' new Senator, John Ken
nedy.
"Eisenhower will steer about the
same course Stevenson would have

steered," predicted Dr. Kreps, whose
reputation as a predieter soared this
fall when he told a hissing Palo Alto
Democratic rally that Eisenhower
would carry the nation by 100 elec
toral votes and California by 230,000
popular votes'.
"The general won't have an easy
row to hoe, but he'll have a great
deal of aid from the Democrats.
His real problem will be to bring
the pressure of the country to
bear on the Senate," be added.
Dr. Kreps concluded his analysis
of the future government's policies
optimistically. "Frankly," he said,
"I expect Ike to disappoint the
rabid Republicans, and surprise the
rabid Democrats, by steering a mid
dle course."
