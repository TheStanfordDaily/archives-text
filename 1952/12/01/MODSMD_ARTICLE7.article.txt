Swish!
That familiar sound will tJfe
heard in the Pavilion once again
this evening, as the Stanford
basketballers, under Bob Bur
nett, open their 1952-53 cam
paign against the "University of

varsity contest will be 8 o'clock,
and no admission will be
charged.
The Cardinal live which takes the
floor tonight will have three familiar
faces missing from last season's*
quintet. Forward Eddie Tucker,
center Jim Ramstead, and guard
Jim Walsh have all gone the way of
graduation.
