# UNDERDOGS
## Strong USF Tests Cards In Cage Tilt 
### PHIL BERMAN 
Swish!
That familiar sound will tJfe
heard in the Pavilion once again
this evening, as the Stanford
basketballers, under Bob Bur
nett, open their 1952-53 cam
paign against the "University of
San Francisco. Tip-off for the
varsity contest will be 8 o'clock,
and no admission will be
charged.
The Cardinal live which takes the
floor tonight will have three familiar
faces missing from last season's*
quintet. Forward Eddie Tucker,
center Jim Ramstead, and guard
Jim Walsh have all gone the way of
graduation.
Only holdovers from the quintet
which won 19 out of 28 games and
finished in a tie lor second in the
PCC Southern Division are guards
Ron Tomsic, 5-10, and Oleg Suz
dulefl', 5-9.
Tomsic, who was only a frosh
last year, sparked the Cards as a
floor man and ball-handler. He also
ended up as fourth high scorer with
321 points.
SuzdalefT, now a junior, averaged
only a little over five points a game
in '52, but set up most of the plays

and was a great floor man.
Still Experimenting
The rest of tonight's lineup is very
much in a fluid state, as Burnett is
still experimenting. George Zani
novich, a senior, a holdover from
the "shock troop" platoon, will most
likely start at one forward, while
either Don Carlson or Don DeLong
will start at the other forward spot.
Burnett is planning to alternate
Dave Epperson and Russ Lawler at
the center spot, at least for the time
being. The Lawler was the
mainstay of last year's Frosh-

Braves, while 6-5 Mi Epperson was
right behind Ramstead. He managed
to get into 23 ball games, tallying 51
points.
Giving the Indians reserve
strength will be Tom Green, Paul
Johnson, Jim Johnson, Sam Motley,
Wayne Loekhart, and A 1 Talboy.
Wayne Culberson and Bruce Ogorek
are a couple of JC transfers from
Ventura JC, 1952 state champs.
Burnett is optimistic about his
club this year. He knows .that UC
LA and Cal will be the powers in
the conference, while Santa Clara

and USF are the leading independ
ents.
"The only edge they 11 have on us
is experience," he said, "and by the
time the conference race opens Jan.
2, we may be ready to pull some
surprises. For the record, though, I
just feel that Nib Price's Bears are
going to cop the title. After all, the
Bruins have been on top a long time,
and they just can't keep it up."
Regarding the style of play his In
dians will use this year, Burnett
said that he plans to keep running
just as he did last season when the
Cards averaged over 73 points a
game.
; The Dons have a veteran squad
| with 11 lettermen back from a team
I that won 11 and lost 13. Six ol those
j defeats were by a margin of three
i points or less, however, including a
-19-52 loss to Stanford.
This will be Indians' only home
i game before the end of the quarter.
Friday and Saturday they will be in

j Eugene, Oregon, to meet the Oregon
I Ducks in a pair or contests. Then the
Card hoopsters close up shop until
after finals.

Tomsic, who was only a frosh
last year, sparked the Cards as a
floor man and ball-handler. He also
ended up as fourth high scorer with
321 points.
SuzdalefT, now a junior, averaged
only a little over five points a game
in '52, but set up most of the plays

and was a great floor man.
Still Experimenting
The rest of tonight's lineup is very
much in a fluid state, as Burnett is
still experimenting. George Zani
novich, a senior, a holdover from
the "shock troop" platoon, will most
likely start at one forward, while
either Don Carlson or Don DeLong
will start at the other forward spot.
Burnett is planning to alternate
Dave Epperson and Russ Lawler at
the center spot, at least for the time
being. The Lawler was the
mainstay of last year's Frosh-

Braves, while 6-5 Mi Epperson was
right behind Ramstead. He managed
to get into 23 ball games, tallying 51
points.
Giving the Indians reserve
strength will be Tom Green, Paul
Johnson, Jim Johnson, Sam Motley,
Wayne Loekhart, and A 1 Talboy.
Wayne Culberson and Bruce Ogorek
are a couple of JC transfers from
Ventura JC, 1952 state champs.
Burnett is optimistic about his
club this year. He knows .that UC
LA and Cal will be the powers in
the conference, while Santa Clara

and USF are the leading independ
ents.
"The only edge they 11 have on us
is experience," he said, "and by the
time the conference race opens Jan.
2, we may be ready to pull some
surprises. For the record, though, I
just feel that Nib Price's Bears are
going to cop the title. After all, the
Bruins have been on top a long time,
and they just can't keep it up."
Regarding the style of play his In
dians will use this year, Burnett
said that he plans to keep running
just as he did last season when the
Cards averaged over 73 points a
game.
; The Dons have a veteran squad
| with 11 lettermen back from a team
I that won 11 and lost 13. Six ol those
j defeats were by a margin of three
i points or less, however, including a
