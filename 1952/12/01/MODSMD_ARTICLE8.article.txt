# Pro-French Win in Saar
## 
### 
SAARBRUECKEN, Saar, Monday.
Doc. 1 (UP) â€” Premier Johannes
Hoffman and his French-sponsored
regime won a major victory early
today in Sunday's showdown elec
tion which appeared to have blasted
any chance of the disputed Saar
territory's early return to Germany.
Hoffman's pro - French Christian
People's party outstripped all three
other political parties in the voting
for a new legislature in this 900-
mile square coal-rich basin on the
French-German border.
He is now in a position to form
immediately a one - party govern
ment or a coalition with the equally
pro - French Socialite Democrats,
who trailed in the voting. A coali
tion cabinet" with the latter party
was considered the more likely step.
The failure of the pro - German
campaign came as a complete sur
prise. especially after the last-min
ute bombshell intervention of Cath
olic and Protestant Evangelical
Church officials who advised Saar
landers they were not morally
obliged to vote.
