"The Reader's Digest is an introduction to
learning. Its variety, brevity, intellec
tual stimulation, selective mental diet, *s
and good humor whet the appetite for more
of the same. It leads to larger fields for
browsing and deeper cerebration."

each month a sweep of information which otherwise could
be obtained only through days and weeks of painstaking
research. Selecting and condensing the most significant
material from hundreds of periodicals, The Reader's Digest

economy of effort.
