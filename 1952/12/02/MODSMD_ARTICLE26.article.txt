It's nice to see that a few people are inter
ested in the liguor situation after all.
Only a couple of weeks ago, the majority of
Stanford's voters failed to vote on a proposed
liguor resolution, and those who did vote turned
down a measure that we felt would start work
loward a realistic, enforceable liguor law.
When no one stepped forward with another
plan of attack, we looked at the whole situation
this way: Stanfoid students were being pretty
hypocritical. Theft vote implied support of a
liquor law which they were violating right and
left. In short, they were drinking wet and vot
ing dry.
We felt that Stanford was turning its back on
a serious problem. So, while we do not favor
enforcing the liquor law for its own sake (we
actually consider it so unrealistic as to be un
enforceable), we suggested that the student
body be ma'de to bear the full brunt of its action
we suggested that the Administration of the
University and the officers of the State govern
ment try living up to the letter of the law.
Our aim was not an RA snooping into every
fraternity garbage can or a dozen students
brought into court. Our aim was to make the
students realize the hypocrisy of their position
;o they would start work toward better, more
ntelligent legislation.
Our intent in suggesting enforcement of the
liquor law was not to criticize those who have

failed in its enforcement so far.
We believe that they are only yielding to
the social mores involved; that they are only
going along with current customs and practices.
Our aim was to start action toward a law which
could be consistent with these customs and
practices.
We have been reproached for showing a lack
of faith in student government. That's probably
true. But nothing would make us happier than
to see our lack of faith proved unfounded.
People have come to us insisting that Stan
ford's student government can do something
about the situation -either in terms of enforce
ment or constructive action. We would like
very much to see this happen - perhaps in the
form of a resolution which the student body
would accept (some readers have written that
they would vote for a resolution recommending
a minimum drinking age of 19 . . . others favor
a more general resolution condemning the cur
rent situation and suggesting that the California
State Legislature start work on more realistic
legislation) or perhaps the formation of a group
at Stanford which would work toward a united
college effort toward alleviating the problem.
Many persons have written and spoken to
us telling us that we are wrong—that Stanford
students are really interested in doing some
thing about the liguor problem. We'd like to
be shown they're right.

actually consider it so unrealistic as to be un
enforceable), we suggested that the student
body be ma'de to bear the full brunt of its action
we suggested that the Administration of the
University and the officers of the State govern
ment try living up to the letter of the law.
Our aim was not an RA snooping into every
fraternity garbage can or a dozen students
brought into court. Our aim was to make the
students realize the hypocrisy of their position
;o they would start work toward better, more
ntelligent legislation.
Our intent in suggesting enforcement of the
liquor law was not to criticize those who have

failed in its enforcement so far.
We believe that they are only yielding to
the social mores involved; that they are only
going along with current customs and practices.
Our aim was to start action toward a law which
could be consistent with these customs and
practices.
We have been reproached for showing a lack
of faith in student government. That's probably
true. But nothing would make us happier than
to see our lack of faith proved unfounded.
People have come to us insisting that Stan
ford's student government can do something
about the situation -either in terms of enforce
ment or constructive action. We would like
very much to see this happen - perhaps in the
form of a resolution which the student body
would accept (some readers have written that
they would vote for a resolution recommending
a minimum drinking age of 19 . . . others favor
a more general resolution condemning the cur
rent situation and suggesting that the California
State Legislature start work on more realistic
legislation) or perhaps the formation of a group
at Stanford which would work toward a united
college effort toward alleviating the problem.
Many persons have written and spoken to
us telling us that we are wrong—that Stanford
students are really interested in doing some
thing about the liguor problem. We'd like to
be shown they're right.
It's nice to see that a few people are inter
ested in the liguor situation after all.
Only a couple of weeks ago, the majority of
Stanford's voters failed to vote on a proposed
liguor resolution, and those who did vote turned
down a measure that we felt would start work
loward a realistic, enforceable liguor law.
When no one stepped forward with another
plan of attack, we looked at the whole situation
this way: Stanfoid students were being pretty
hypocritical. Theft vote implied support of a
liquor law which they were violating right and
left. In short, they were drinking wet and vot
ing dry.
We felt that Stanford was turning its back on
a serious problem. So, while we do not favor
enforcing the liquor law for its own sake (we
actually consider it so unrealistic as to be un
enforceable), we suggested that the student
body be ma'de to bear the full brunt of its action
we suggested that the Administration of the
