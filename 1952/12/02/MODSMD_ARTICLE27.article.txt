1 descend upon my students at eight in the morning
like the mallet in the amusement park, hoping to
drive its objective to greater heights than the mallet

Our purpose is to make art; often commercial but
never un-fine.

It is my function to provide in
formation for persons who, daily
or on weekends only, have chosen
to call themselves designers. Our
search for truth is not confined to
areas of fact however; it is also,
perhaps firstly, concerned with
heart. Through believing this, I
have come to place emphasis upon
it, to seek the emotional content
and purpose in art, to learn and
to teach the skill of welling up

so that at the epitome of wholesome expression de
signer and passive participant alike can be thrilled
with the substance of the work.
Operating on adrenalin rather than sedatives, the
designer is driven into crystal thinking rather than
self-indulgence. His enthusiasm supports his ex

plorations. This stretching out credits the designer
with a boy-scout-like list of virtues which are, in
turn, inherent in his work. They are isolated, for the
sake of clarity, as follows:
A designer is rich in experience. He sees analytic
ally and' can thus call upon virgin and distilled ex
periences to support .him when the problem is, as it
so often is, to make something out of nothing.
A designer builds. Utilizing, but not victimized by
hindsight, he builds upon existing standards, both
personal and public to arrive at new levels of service
and stimulus.
A designer is courageous. By innovating he may
surprise the observer, sometimes alienating himself
from the society he seeks to enrich.
A designer invents. History books record the early
aspirations of certain great inventors as "artistic."
Inventors no longer have to leave the field of art to
find a full outlet for their talents. Great discovery is
at home from refrigerators to murals.
A designer has control. Intensity of purpose ap
plies to refining as well as discovering.
My daily intimacy with the robust but sensitive
manner of modern art is something I would share
with the layman who, whether he realizes it or not,
is a patron in this broad field. Your intelligence is
more deeply offended by dull derivative form in art
than by the brazen effort of an artist keyed up in his
search lor brilliance.

My daily intimacy with the robust but sensitive
manner of modern art is something I would share
with the layman who, whether he realizes it or not,
is a patron in this broad field. Your intelligence is
more deeply offended by dull derivative form in art
than by the brazen effort of an artist keyed up in his
search lor brilliance.

1 descend upon my students at eight in the morning
like the mallet in the amusement park, hoping to
drive its objective to greater heights than the mallet
fell from, yes, even to ring bells.
Our purpose is to make art; often commercial but
never un-fine.

It is my function to provide in
formation for persons who, daily
or on weekends only, have chosen
to call themselves designers. Our
search for truth is not confined to
areas of fact however; it is also,
perhaps firstly, concerned with
heart. Through believing this, I
have come to place emphasis upon
it, to seek the emotional content
and purpose in art, to learn and
to teach the skill of welling up

so that at the epitome of wholesome expression de
signer and passive participant alike can be thrilled
with the substance of the work.
Operating on adrenalin rather than sedatives, the
designer is driven into crystal thinking rather than
self-indulgence. His enthusiasm supports his ex

plorations. This stretching out credits the designer
with a boy-scout-like list of virtues which are, in
turn, inherent in his work. They are isolated, for the
sake of clarity, as follows:
A designer is rich in experience. He sees analytic
ally and' can thus call upon virgin and distilled ex
periences to support .him when the problem is, as it
so often is, to make something out of nothing.
A designer builds. Utilizing, but not victimized by
hindsight, he builds upon existing standards, both
personal and public to arrive at new levels of service
and stimulus.
A designer is courageous. By innovating he may
surprise the observer, sometimes alienating himself
from the society he seeks to enrich.
A designer invents. History books record the early
aspirations of certain great inventors as "artistic."
Inventors no longer have to leave the field of art to
find a full outlet for their talents. Great discovery is
at home from refrigerators to murals.
A designer has control. Intensity of purpose ap
plies to refining as well as discovering.
