Steve Thomas, a first-year man that likes to ap
peal' sharp and neat, used to get up and shave with
his electric razor every i.norning before going to his
H o'clock class. He has six 8 o'clock classes. He has
two roommates. Neither have 8 o'clock classes.

Angered by being awakened
(•very morning, they passed a law
(with a volt* of 2 to 1) that no one
could shave in their room between
the hours of 4 a.m. and 10 a.m. '
thinking this would insure them I
i/l a blissful, uninterrupted sleep
every night.
With stubbornness and a desire
to be neat, Steve now sets his
alarm for 3:55 a.m., gets up and
shaves.

The Big Game has been over for quite a while, but
1 came across a humorous incident the other day that
is good enough to merit printing under my by-line,

About 4;. n .O a.m. the Wednesday before Big Game,
John Florida and a friend (known affectionately as
Bob Stetson) were guarding by the Geology Corner
when they spotted a wandering college punk (how
I hate college punks). Under close interrogation they
found their suspicious character to be an inebriated
freshman from Santa Clara.
He had come with soyie friends after an evening
in the City, and in passing had dropped by to raise
some trouble (Hell), lie and his friends had been
discovered near Che bonfire earlier and had sepa
rated and run. He couldn't find his buddies and ,
had been wandering around Stanford for two hours
trying to figure out how to get off the campus to
I'll ( amino so he could try to hitch a ride home.
Now all this just goes to show that if you drink
don't raise trouble, and il you raise trouble don't
drink.

Steve Thomas, a first-year man that likes to ap
peal' sharp and neat, used to get up and shave with
his electric razor every i.norning before going to his
H o'clock class. He has six 8 o'clock classes. He has
two roommates. Neither have 8 o'clock classes.

Angered by being awakened
(•very morning, they passed a law
(with a volt* of 2 to 1) that no one
could shave in their room between
the hours of 4 a.m. and 10 a.m. '
thinking this would insure them I
i/l a blissful, uninterrupted sleep
every night.
With stubbornness and a desire
to be neat, Steve now sets his
alarm for 3:55 a.m., gets up and
shaves.

The Big Game has been over for quite a while, but
1 came across a humorous incident the other day that
is good enough to merit printing under my by-line,

About 4;. n .O a.m. the Wednesday before Big Game,
John Florida and a friend (known affectionately as
Bob Stetson) were guarding by the Geology Corner
when they spotted a wandering college punk (how
I hate college punks). Under close interrogation they
found their suspicious character to be an inebriated
freshman from Santa Clara.
He had come with soyie friends after an evening
in the City, and in passing had dropped by to raise
some trouble (Hell), lie and his friends had been
discovered near Che bonfire earlier and had sepa
rated and run. He couldn't find his buddies and ,
had been wandering around Stanford for two hours
trying to figure out how to get off the campus to
I'll ( amino so he could try to hitch a ride home.
Now all this just goes to show that if you drink
don't raise trouble, and il you raise trouble don't
drink.

Optimist—man whose glass is half full.
Pessimist—man whose glass is half empty.
Obviously the Golden Mean between optimism and
pessimism is the man who chug-a-lugs every glass.
Encina Hall is not in favor of the lone woman rule.
Neither ara the lone women.
