# CAMPUS OPINION
## Good Because Violated? 
### 
To the Editor:
Reader "Lee" Phillips has forreetly characterized his
letter in Monday's Daily as an example of "warped
reasoning." If I understand him correctly, he is
arguing' that the present liquor law is good precisely
localise it is violated; that in violating the law minors
learn to handle liquor as they would not learn if their
drinking were legal. In a society based on law and
order, this conccpt of a law passed in the hope that
it will be discretely violated is rather frightening.
Apart from this legalistic criticism, however, just
how does Mr. Phillips expect illegal drinking by

minors to produce this beneficial efTect? If it is
merely that drinkers who know they are violating the
law drink more carefully and cause less trouble,
would not universal prohibition be the sensible
answer? I think Mr. Phillips will agree that this
would not be advisable. If it is that young people
must have first-hand experience with liquor before
they can handle it wisely, is there any advantage in
making their first experience one of law breaking,
with heavy penalties for their inevitable errors of
judgment?
Whatever the solution to the liquor problem may
be, it is not a probationary period of illegal drinking
to turn "immature children" into "reasonable adults."
