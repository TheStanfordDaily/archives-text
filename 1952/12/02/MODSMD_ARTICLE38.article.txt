## THE 						DOPE SHEET Something for the Fans 
### 
With the aid of that old Stanford tradition known as the Big Game
Party, I have almost completely made myself forget the current football
.season, except for the one little point that I would here like to bring out.
While sitting high in the rooting section at Cal, surrounded by various
male and female friends, one of these females made an intelligent comment
worth repeating. I make note of this as it is very unusual intlecd to hear
an intelligent comment from a female at a football game.
Says she, "Iley you. (our friendship, though close, had not been of
subsequent length for her to have remembered my name), here's a swell
Idea! I.ookit the way all these Cal players have numbers corresponding
to their positions."
Any t ui ther comment by this aforesaid female was lost in the subsequent
:u tion I stood up, one of my friends shouted the familiar phrase "roll !
'im," and 1 fiext found myself sitting 1G rows below.
Hut this comment upon the numbering of football players has since
been brought up again by the fellow sitting next to me in Econ. This fellow,
one ol the most astute tick-tack-toe experts I have ever encountered in
my two years ol taking Eeon courses at Stantord, and thus held in high
esteem by yours truly, proceeded to write me a dissertation on the ad-I
vantages of a systemized numbering system at Stanford and throughout
the PCC.
It shall be noted here that both UCLA. Cal, and most of the nation's other '
big teams, as well as Oregon and some of our other Northern neighbors. \
have instituted this universal system with great success.
The system is simple; number 20 through 2!) the quarterbacks, 10-1!)
the left h-dfhacks, 30-3!) the right halfbacks, 10-4!) the fullbacks, r>o-!>!)
tile centers, (>()-(;!) (be guards, 70-7!) the tackles, and XO-X!) the ends.
Thus we believe (we use common phraseology in columns to make the
leader think that someone who possibly knows something about the matter
is backing the writer, who usually knows nothing) that this system would
help the students and other spectators associate the names, numbers, and
positions of the various players, and aid in recognizing the position played
bv substitutes who's name are not overly familiar with the fans.
Also, we believe that this system would be of great aid to people both
in the stands and those at home watching the game over television. They
would be able to recognize the position of every player and be able to i
follow the play more closely.
And let us not lorget the little ladies, whose knowledge of \hc game
is olt times limited. This unified system of numbering according to
positions would greatly aid them in learning the intricacies of the game,
and in becoming a fan in every pom-pom waving essence of the word.
And finally, let us not forget the aid to publicity. The general public
would be more readily become acquainted with outstanding Stanford
athletes, both by comparison of name, number, and position,, and by being
able to follow them more closely at the games.
Thus, as the girl said, "Hey you. here's a good idea!!!"
The PCC conference will be held Dec. 7-11. Could it be possible for
someone from Stanford to bring up this idea before the other schools, if just
to see what they think of it. -Any advantages that Stanford would have
would be shared by all the other coast schools, and the gain would be
universal.
As we said, Cal and most of the big mid-western schools use it, and
we dou t notiec any attendance reductions because of its adaptations. |
On the contrary, the customers recognize and appreciate "something for
the fans."

Party, I have almost completely made myself forget the current football
.season, except for the one little point that I would here like to bring out.
While sitting high in the rooting section at Cal, surrounded by various
male and female friends, one of these females made an intelligent comment
worth repeating. I make note of this as it is very unusual intlecd to hear
an intelligent comment from a female at a football game.
Says she, "Iley you. (our friendship, though close, had not been of
subsequent length for her to have remembered my name), here's a swell
Idea! I.ookit the way all these Cal players have numbers corresponding
to their positions."
Any t ui ther comment by this aforesaid female was lost in the subsequent
:u tion I stood up, one of my friends shouted the familiar phrase "roll !
'im," and 1 fiext found myself sitting 1G rows below.
Hut this comment upon the numbering of football players has since
been brought up again by the fellow sitting next to me in Econ. This fellow,
one ol the most astute tick-tack-toe experts I have ever encountered in
my two years ol taking Eeon courses at Stantord, and thus held in high
esteem by yours truly, proceeded to write me a dissertation on the ad-I
vantages of a systemized numbering system at Stanford and throughout
the PCC.
It shall be noted here that both UCLA. Cal, and most of the nation's other '
big teams, as well as Oregon and some of our other Northern neighbors. \
have instituted this universal system with great success.
The system is simple; number 20 through 2!) the quarterbacks, 10-1!)
the left h-dfhacks, 30-3!) the right halfbacks, 10-4!) the fullbacks, r>o-!>!)
tile centers, (>()-(;!) (be guards, 70-7!) the tackles, and XO-X!) the ends.
Thus we believe (we use common phraseology in columns to make the
leader think that someone who possibly knows something about the matter
is backing the writer, who usually knows nothing) that this system would
help the students and other spectators associate the names, numbers, and
positions of the various players, and aid in recognizing the position played
bv substitutes who's name are not overly familiar with the fans.
Also, we believe that this system would be of great aid to people both
in the stands and those at home watching the game over television. They
would be able to recognize the position of every player and be able to i
follow the play more closely.
And let us not lorget the little ladies, whose knowledge of \hc game
is olt times limited. This unified system of numbering according to
positions would greatly aid them in learning the intricacies of the game,
and in becoming a fan in every pom-pom waving essence of the word.
And finally, let us not forget the aid to publicity. The general public
would be more readily become acquainted with outstanding Stanford
athletes, both by comparison of name, number, and position,, and by being
able to follow them more closely at the games.
Thus, as the girl said, "Hey you. here's a good idea!!!"
The PCC conference will be held Dec. 7-11. Could it be possible for
someone from Stanford to bring up this idea before the other schools, if just
to see what they think of it. -Any advantages that Stanford would have
would be shared by all the other coast schools, and the gain would be
universal.
As we said, Cal and most of the big mid-western schools use it, and
we dou t notiec any attendance reductions because of its adaptations. |
On the contrary, the customers recognize and appreciate "something for
the fans."
