Stanford, but he was unable to
counteract the strong Stanford at
tack.

Henderson with four goals, followed
closely by Ralph Perlberger and

Fred Simpich with two, and Joe
McKenny with one.
Arizona will have a chance to
avenge themselves this Christmas
vacation, when the Indians will
journey to Arizona.
Saturday Stanford met a strong
Colorado A&M team, which had
previously given NMMI — the na
tional champs — two close games.
Stanford came to life in the second
half to win 3-1. Colorado A&M was
at some disadvantage since they had
not been able to practice during the
last 10 days because of heavy snows
[ in Colorado, and they were unac
customed to Stanford ponies. Their
lone goal was scored by Marvin
Bweman, who together with left
handed Bill Lyall gave the Indians
most trouble. Simpich, McCreery.
j and Henderson scored one each for
I Stanford.
