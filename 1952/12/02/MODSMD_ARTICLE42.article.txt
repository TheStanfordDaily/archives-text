# Braves Open Season With 77-54 Victory
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
Coa h Eddie Tucker made his
debut a successful one as,his Braves
ho-hummed their way to a 77-54
win over Fremont High before a
sparse crowd in the Pavilion.
Big noise in the Brave attack was
Howie Schwartz, who dumped in 19
points in about one half of play.
Northern California's best lineman.
Sam Morley, shoved in 13 points in
his short tour of duty, and JC trans
fer Wayne Culberson dumped in 17.
Culberson had the
of being the lirst Card basketball
player to score when lie dumped
in a lav-up to open the Fremont
tilt. Culberson and Schwartz
scored all 1!) points for the Cards
in the fir.-1 quarter.
In the second quarter, Morley re
placed Schwartz and continued the
scoring parade. The Cards led 37-25
at half-time, and increased their
lead in the second half.
Coach Tucker cleared the bench
in an effort to keep the score down,
but it was hopeless. However, in
their victory, the Braves showed
several weaknesses which might
cost them in later tilts. The Cards
were unable to hit from farther
than one foot out and their con
stant fouling enabled Ed Wagner of
Fremont to hit 11 free throws in 1(S
tries.
Wagner ended up the day as high
scorer with 18 points, but the most
awesome sight of the day was pro
vided by Fremont's 14-year-old
6-ft. 6-in. center Jerry Robinson.
Robinson only hit four points, but
he showed occasional flashes of bril
liance and might easily reach great
ness in future years.
