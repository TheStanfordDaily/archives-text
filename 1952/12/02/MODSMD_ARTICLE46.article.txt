# Frosh Come From Behind To Upset USF
## 
### WES MARX 
Stanford's frosh quintet made
their season's initial appearance a
good one by edging USF's Dons 51-
48, in last night's preliminary to the
varsity encounter.
Dick Clegg's Papooses overcame a j
four-point deficit at tiie end of the 1
third quarter to get the win. In !
the fourth quarter the two teams
played "You score, I score" ball till
the count was 45-all. Then Stan
ford tenter PauhPerko tapped in a
rebound for two points. George Sel
leck followed with a bull's-eye on a
jump shot for a four-point advan
tage.
With a minute to go USF guard |
Dan Powers closed the space to I
three points on a free throw. Sel- j
lick commenced to more than match |
Pdwers' coolness. The Compton lad |
was awarded two charity tosses af- j
ter being fouled. Both went through j
the nets. That was the ball game as
the Dons failed to match that five
point lead.
With 24 points the Dons' center. |
G-8 Bill Russell, led the scoring pa- i
rade. But the scoring of the lanky |
Russell was overshadowed by the I
all - round cohrt play of Stanford 1
guard George Selleck. Selleck, of j
slight stature and below basket- J
ball's usual requirement of six-foot
plus men, tallied 17 points for team
scoring honors.
His hustle caught the USF offense
of! guard continually and his sharp
passing led to other Stanford scores.
Forward Gunnar Christiansen con-j
tributed 12 points to the Stanford i
cause, six of them coming in the 1
hectic fourth period.
