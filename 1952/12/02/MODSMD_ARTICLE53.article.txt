## Marise Cherin Is Radio Siren 
### TOM PEIRCE 
The identity of KZSU's Aphro
dite of the Airwaves, who has
been haunting the hearts of Stan
ford men all quarter, was re
vealed last night.
She is 19 - year - old sophomore
; Marise Cherin. The radio siren is
five feet five inches tall, weighs 110
pounds, has curly light brown hair,
j grey-green eyes, and lives in Casa
Adelfa at Lagunita.
As to her . . . less obvious . . .
characteristics, Miss Cherin plays
tvmpnni in tho Stanford orchestra.
I)rays about her long fingernails
and eyelashes, breeds tropical fish
as a hobby, loves to nickname
people, and (get this, men) is
Sadie both on and o(T the air.
j Marise was picked over a host of
other applicants for the position
of Stanford Sadie because (if her
very sultry voice.
Monday night, Sadie's night to
croon, has been something unusual
on the Stanford campus. This wa?
the evening when all social and ex
tra-curricular activities were aban
doned. when all revelry was stilled.
In every house doors were bolted
and lights were dimmed. An ex
pectant hush fell over the entire
University. Even Ro.ssotti's closed
early because of the lack of custom
ers.
And then, from the stillness, a
long S-I-G-H was heard from
Encina, followed by a deeper and
more sophisticated moan from
Crothcrs, and fraternity
houses, and couirterpointcd by
small squeals from the women's
residences.
And through the din one voice

stood out, soft and sultry and sug
gestive. "Hello, darling . . . Been
getting any loving lately? Well, just
cuddle up, and tell me all about
it . . . because you know, sweet
heart, I love you more than anyone
else . . . etc., etc. . .
Stanford Sadie's history dates
hack to the founding of radio sta
tion KZSU. Slic was one of the
first programs on the first Stan
ford station, and her popular ap
peal has made her a permanent s

one. Her purpose is hut one: to
lure Stanford men away from
their "books and studies.
This she accomplishes by a vari
ety of methods. Sadie can be ten
der, cajoling, or funny. She fnay be a
loving confidant, a sultry woman of
the world, or a hard-bitten moll.
She can be sulky, slinky, sexy, or
stupid. All that matters is that the
men listen to her, long for her, and
love her. And they do.
