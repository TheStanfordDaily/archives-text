## Vardac Scores U.S. Films For False Picture of Life 
### TED GIESE 
Tin? pt usentalion ol false, romantic, immature pictuies is ham
peri imj the effectiveness of the American film in communicating
information about the true American society.
This was the belief expressed by Dr. Nicholas Vardac, director
ol the Stanford Players, at last night's Tuesday Evening Series

program.
Dr. Vardac, speaking on "Tlie
Kilni in ;i Free Society," noted that
American moving pictures are show
ing ail increasing amount of bru
tality, indeccncy, and immorality.
In Denmark alone, more than 30
American - made films have been
banned, he said.
The motion picture can be a pow
erful sprcarer of ideas and ideals.
But, stated Dr. Vardac, an audi
ence tends to .grasp the symbols
most readily available when trying
to evaluate another country through
imported films. In most cases, the
symbols furnished by the American
film tend to be misleading.
"For example," Dr. Vardac
pointed out, "we in America can
easily sec the gangster picture as [
representing only a small part of j
the sum total of our socictv. For- j
cigncrs have no basis on which to
make this judgment."
Dr. Vardac compared the struc
tures of American and foreign films j
through the use of excerpts from
some typical productions: "Tight
Little Island" from Britain, "God
Needs Men" from France, "Open
City" from Italy, and "Where the j
Sidewalk Ends" from America.
The foreign motion picture is
most often a simple plot concerned
with some sort of action by a social
group. "The plot is implicit in the i
circumstances," said Dr. Vardac.
"There is no need for artifice, be- M
cause the unique truth Ls so much
more interesting."
By contrast, the American film '
lends to develop into a "Buck
Rogers, Superman, two-listed in
dividual-hero story." Violence is
often Ibe order of the day. The
idea of the lone hero is an un
realistic and misleading one.
Efforts are now being backed by
the State Department to improve |
the quality of American films, ac- |
cording to Dr. Vardac. "The posi- '
(ion of the American motion pic
ture in the field of constructive en
tertainment, rather than pure di
version, could well be reconsid
ered," be remarked.

Tin? pt usentalion ol false, romantic, immature pictuies is ham
peri imj the effectiveness of the American film in communicating
information about the true American society.
This was the belief expressed by Dr. Nicholas Vardac, director
ol the Stanford Players, at last night's Tuesday Evening Series

program.
Dr. Vardac, speaking on "Tlie
Kilni in ;i Free Society," noted that
American moving pictures are show
ing ail increasing amount of bru
tality, indeccncy, and immorality.
In Denmark alone, more than 30
American - made films have been
banned, he said.
The motion picture can be a pow
erful sprcarer of ideas and ideals.
But, stated Dr. Vardac, an audi
ence tends to .grasp the symbols
most readily available when trying
to evaluate another country through
imported films. In most cases, the
symbols furnished by the American
film tend to be misleading.
"For example," Dr. Vardac
pointed out, "we in America can
easily sec the gangster picture as [
representing only a small part of j
the sum total of our socictv. For- j
cigncrs have no basis on which to
make this judgment."
Dr. Vardac compared the struc
tures of American and foreign films j
through the use of excerpts from
some typical productions: "Tight
Little Island" from Britain, "God
Needs Men" from France, "Open
City" from Italy, and "Where the j
Sidewalk Ends" from America.
The foreign motion picture is
most often a simple plot concerned
with some sort of action by a social
group. "The plot is implicit in the i
circumstances," said Dr. Vardac.
"There is no need for artifice, be- M
cause the unique truth Ls so much
more interesting."
By contrast, the American film '
lends to develop into a "Buck
Rogers, Superman, two-listed in
dividual-hero story." Violence is
often Ibe order of the day. The
idea of the lone hero is an un
realistic and misleading one.
Efforts are now being backed by
the State Department to improve |
the quality of American films, ac- |
cording to Dr. Vardac. "The posi- '
(ion of the American motion pic
ture in the field of constructive en
tertainment, rather than pure di
version, could well be reconsid
ered," be remarked.
