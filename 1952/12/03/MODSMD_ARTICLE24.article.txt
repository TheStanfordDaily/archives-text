# Taft, Ike Breakup Seen
## Senator Blasts Durkin's Appointment to Cabinet 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7, (UP)-Sen. Robert A.*Taft opened hia
first post-election rilt with president-elect Dwigfit D. Eisenhower
today by anqrily denouncing Eisenhower's choice of Democrat
Martin P. Durkin to be new Secretary of Labor.
Taft said the appointment of Durkin, a supporter of Adlai L'.

Stevenson, was "incredible" and an
"affront" to Democrats find union
members who voted the Republican
ticket.
"It was never suggested," the
chairman of (he Republican Senate
Policy Committee said, "that a man
would be appointed who has always
been a partisan of Truman Demo
crats, who fought Gen. Eisenhower's
election, and advocated the repeal
of the Taft-Hartley Law."
The Ohio Senator made Hear,
however, he intends "no reflection
on the character or ability of Mr.
Durkin.'' This seemed to rule out
any possibility of Taft attempting to
block Seitate confirmation of the
Durkin appointment
Durkin, who stepped down a*
president of the AFL Plumbers'
Union following his selection
Monday, appeared inyuffled l>y
Tuft's blast. He said he still hopes
for "eventual" co-operation with
the Senator and disagreed that his
appointment is an affront to any
Eisenhower supporters.
Taft's denunciation of (lie Dm km
appointment was bus first publi<-
criticism of Eisenhower's cabinet,
which is complete. Taft. and. Eisen
hower waged a bitter battle for the
Republican Presidential .nomination
but closed ranks after the GOP con
vention.
Before Taft issued his angry state -
ment, Durkin had called for an early
meeting between the Ohio Senator
and top union leaders to discuss re
vision of the Taft-Hartley Law. The
Ohio Senator's statement appai
ently dimmed Durkin's hopes of -t
peace meeting.
There seemed no possibility (lie
Senator's blast, would affect. Ei: en
bower's forthcoming legislative pro
gram, although it might spur Taft to
make a more active bid for the post
of Senate Republican leader in tin:
new Congress.
That would give Taft even rlns
er control over legislative propo
sals than if he remained as Sen
ate policy leader. Taft has said he
is "available" for the leadership
post if Sen. Styles Bridges doesn't
want to continue in the post.
At the request of Eisenhower, Taft.
submitted recommendations for all
cabinet posts, but his suggestion w?::
followed only in the designation <->r
E7,ra Taft Benson of Utah to bo
Secretary of Agriculture.
