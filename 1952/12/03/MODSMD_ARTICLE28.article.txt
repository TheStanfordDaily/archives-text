### DICK MANSFIELD 
Af-;i. any Stanford rough. The most beautiful of all
Stanford traditions is the Big Game Date.-. Are Dutch
iadition. Vie Palmieri, Bull Sessioner, referred to
lus grand old tradition as SEGDOGD: She Either
Dutch O'r Gets Ditched. The idea is thai after
hat Big Game, we all romp oft' to San Francisco and
vhoop it up. For our celebrations, he pays half, she
>ays half. It's a tine tradition.

Colin McTite believed in this
tradition. "She goes Dutch, eh?"
he thought. "It's Big Game Date
tune!" So Colin got a date, and
i ight after the Big Game he raced
to San Francisco and spent $34.03.
This \vas partly because Colin's
Bearcat got only mile to the
gallon, but mostly because Colin
believed in that good old Big
Game Dates Are Dutch tradition,
lie coveted the thought of re-

ceiving $17.02 from his dale. Colin was a penny
pincher.
The time is more than two weeks later. The scene:
A panel discussion of Freshman dating, which is free,
-a Colin has a date, who is the same girl he took on
a SEGDOGD Big Game date. Briefly, this is the
situation: The girl hasn't ponied up her $17.01 Va. It
is too late for her to Get Ditched Colin needs that
$17 OlVa. Under cover of a general burst of applause,
he speaks.
McTITE (Casually): Say, Florence, did you reail

Palmieri's Bull Session u couple of weeks ago?
FLO: O, yaaas! Wasn't it a screeeem!? (Little
chuckle).
McTITE (Getting tense): About Big Game?
FLO: Of course! Hee! flee!
McTITE (Desperately): About Big Game tradition?
FLO: Silly! The discussion is over. 1/et's go,
Later, At a dogfight.
McTITE (Forced casual air): Gee, my bank balance
is sure flat!
FLO: 1 can't hear what you're saying over all this
noise.
KOVEK: Aioo! Arf! Arf!
McTITE: I haven't got any money . . .
FLO: We can be happy without money!
Still later. Another, smaller, dogfight. '
McTITE: Have you spent any money lately?
FLO: Never! Absolutely.
McTITE (Menacingly): What about SEGDOGD?
FLO: Why . . , what ever are you talking about?
FIDO: Aroo!
McTITE: Aroogah! (Swings oft' through trees)
Stanford Woman! Is your Big Game escort going
ape? Remember the words of Palmieri (Hats oft",
men): "She Either Goes Dutch O'r Gets Ditched."
'lite grapevine says that, some of the coeds at this
institution haven't been living up to tradition. Don't
let your Man, like Colin McTite, be Up A tree for pin
money. SEGDOGD comes but once a year; let's honor
those dear old Stanford traditions.
