c Irlea of the Bill"
To the Editor: .
There has been much difference of opinion ron
rerning the defeated Liquor Resolution, and one can
raise un argument in any bull session by merely men
tioning it. Each individual seem.s to have a definite
point of view on (he matter from which he can not
be swayed There is, however, a curious generalization
I hut a person can draw from the controversies in that
I be real purpose of the bill, as 1 for one understand it,
is not discussed.
The idea of the bill I as an individual received
by leading the Daily's editorials, the mimeographed
; beets put out by the backers, and listening to pro
lesolution students wai to further the lights of
tbose under age. It was not just to legalize the sale
i/t soint- alcoholic beverages to minors. In short, it
was my impression that the ultimate end of the reso
lution was Jo start action towards lowering the legal
age ot maturity to eighteen years.
ii>« general trend in campus hull sessions was to
be greatly in favor of the resolution; thus, (he poll
taker could have been very easily misled. Implica
tions like this are typical of our generation, for we
like to give the impression that we are rather wild
and carefree. This nonchalance is shown in our
seeming indifference to many taxing problems that
we face.
(>ne could say, though, that the apathy displayed is
downright superficial. Actually we are not nonchalant
at all, but very serious minded. The majority of us
youngsters follow the old adage, "Look before you
leap."
Time and time again we come through to show the
older loo called wiser) people that we are capable of
responsibility. We must keep on showing this capa
bility, but a 'yes" on the Liquor Resolution was not
he way.
However, 1 do not wish to foster the opinion that
f think all those who voted for the resolution are
Mingling, unthinking adolescents.
i personally think, however, thai it would he bel
li i to support a proposition that had more chance of
being passed and less negative appeal. What senator
would vote for a hill proposed by non-voters thai
is clearly opposed bv a majority of the voters? We
would have more success in gaining our purpose of
minor's rights if we would meet it head on instead
of trying to slip in the back door.
So 1 suggest that the ASSU sponsor a proposition
to lower the voting age to eighteen. This Lill would
accomplish the same end as the one voted down. It
is a bill thai would have wide appeal over the entire
country and an excellent chance of being passed.
Howevei it has never been pushed by an organized
group.
Then if the studeiits wished to sponsor a bill to
lower the drinking age, they would have the power of
vote to accomplish their aims and to bring attention
to our desires.
In closing, 1 wish to propose a toast of thanks to
all those who voted with the best interests of their
fellow beings at heart. Even though the proposition
was not passed, the wheels of thought have started
to turn.

Arcountinp; of Symposium
To the Editor:
As there may lie persons on (lie campus who are
interested in the recent faculty-student symposium
on "Intellectual Freedom," which the Daily failed to
report, perhaps you will allow me to give an ac
counting of it.
The moderator was incompetent, snagging nascent
discussion with innacurate explication of questions
under consideration. His method was to discover the
trifling, ami to pose watered-down controversy with
an air of naive but challenging expectancy.
It is little wonder, then, that the panel skirted
issues. There was discussion of particulars; few gen
eralizations were drawn. Associate Dean Ray N.
Falknei quoted Dr. Jordan and Mrs. Stanford on
University policy in regard to politics. He noted a
trend toward bi-partisanship on the campus. (Cf. Ihe
resolution of March 1952.)
John Troxell, Professor of Industrial Relations,
herdaed Professor Whilaker for partaking in the
recent L'affair Stevenson Petition. It was a sly use
of the University name, he contended. He warned
students to beware of organizations, and cited his
experience ul the University of Wisconsin where
debate grew so heated thai students were threatened
with immersion into the ice-packed lake. Troxell,
quite emotional, warned that this must not he per
mitted to occur at Stanford.
Virgil K. Whitaker, head of the Department of
English, was the only panel member to be granted
a round of applause. The audience reacted when Mr.
Whitaker defined the role of the professor in evalu
ating and communicating partisan ideas. He likened
the scholar to an M.D., both of whom, he said, were
more competent than the layman at reaching an
opinion Intellectual freedom implies, he said, not
only the instigation of ideas, but al.so a willingness
to follow competent leadership.
The student panel people dealt with such topics
as, What do girls talk about in their dormitories?
and "Thank (Jod for tenure," the Stanford University
professor need no fear a surprise demise. The audi
ence, in my section of Cubberly, sensed that crucial
matters were not being met head on. In the post
panel discussion they raised questions on McCarthy
ism, the definition of subversiveness, and the general
fear that has Hooded the democratic "market place
of ideas."
The professors of Ihe panel refused to comment
except superficially on these issues. The students
were apathetic.
I might add thai at-the premature terminus of the
audience discussi6n I was still weighted with two
questions, and 1 wish to ask them now. The first is
directed to each member of the panel Just what will
happen if we permit all teachers suspected of Com
munist sympathies to continue in their present ca
pacities?
The second question is directed at Professor Troxell,
who spoke with flippant sadness of the disappear
ance "of the good old fashion socialist "• Would Mr.
Troxell permit the formation of a good old fashion
Socialist Party Club on Campus? Why?

So 1 suggest that the ASSU sponsor a proposition
to lower the voting age to eighteen. This Lill would
accomplish the same end as the one voted down. It
is a bill thai would have wide appeal over the entire
country and an excellent chance of being passed.
Howevei it has never been pushed by an organized
group.
Then if the studeiits wished to sponsor a bill to
lower the drinking age, they would have the power of
vote to accomplish their aims and to bring attention

In closing, 1 wish to propose a toast of thanks to
all those who voted with the best interests of their

Arcountinp; of Symposium
To the Editor:
As there may lie persons on (lie campus who are
interested in the recent faculty-student symposium
on "Intellectual Freedom," which the Daily failed to
report, perhaps you will allow me to give an ac
counting of it.
The moderator was incompetent, snagging nascent
discussion with innacurate explication of questions
under consideration. His method was to discover the
trifling, ami to pose watered-down controversy with
an air of naive but challenging expectancy.
It is little wonder, then, that the panel skirted
issues. There was discussion of particulars; few gen
eralizations were drawn. Associate Dean Ray N.
Falknei quoted Dr. Jordan and Mrs. Stanford on
University policy in regard to politics. He noted a
trend toward bi-partisanship on the campus. (Cf. Ihe
resolution of March 1952.)
John Troxell, Professor of Industrial Relations,
herdaed Professor Whilaker for partaking in the
recent L'affair Stevenson Petition. It was a sly use
of the University name, he contended. He warned
students to beware of organizations, and cited his
experience ul the University of Wisconsin where
debate grew so heated thai students were threatened
with immersion into the ice-packed lake. Troxell,
quite emotional, warned that this must not he per
mitted to occur at Stanford.
Virgil K. Whitaker, head of the Department of
English, was the only panel member to be granted
a round of applause. The audience reacted when Mr.
Whitaker defined the role of the professor in evalu
ating and communicating partisan ideas. He likened
the scholar to an M.D., both of whom, he said, were
more competent than the layman at reaching an
opinion Intellectual freedom implies, he said, not
only the instigation of ideas, but al.so a willingness
to follow competent leadership.
The student panel people dealt with such topics
as, What do girls talk about in their dormitories?
and "Thank (Jod for tenure," the Stanford University
professor need no fear a surprise demise. The audi
ence, in my section of Cubberly, sensed that crucial
matters were not being met head on. In the post
panel discussion they raised questions on McCarthy
ism, the definition of subversiveness, and the general
fear that has Hooded the democratic "market place
of ideas."
The professors of Ihe panel refused to comment
except superficially on these issues. The students
were apathetic.
I might add thai at-the premature terminus of the
audience discussi6n I was still weighted with two
questions, and 1 wish to ask them now. The first is
directed to each member of the panel Just what will
happen if we permit all teachers suspected of Com
munist sympathies to continue in their present ca
pacities?
The second question is directed at Professor Troxell,
who spoke with flippant sadness of the disappear
ance "of the good old fashion socialist "• Would Mr.
Troxell permit the formation of a good old fashion
Socialist Party Club on Campus? Why?

To the Editor:
As there may lie persons on (lie campus who are
interested in the recent faculty-student symposium
on "Intellectual Freedom," which the Daily failed to
report, perhaps you will allow me to give an ac
counting of it.
The moderator was incompetent, snagging nascent
discussion with innacurate explication of questions
under consideration. His method was to discover the
trifling, ami to pose watered-down controversy with
an air of naive but challenging expectancy.
It is little wonder, then, that the panel skirted
issues. There was discussion of particulars; few gen
eralizations were drawn. Associate Dean Ray N.
Falknei quoted Dr. Jordan and Mrs. Stanford on
University policy in regard to politics. He noted a
trend toward bi-partisanship on the campus. (Cf. Ihe
resolution of March 1952.)
John Troxell, Professor of Industrial Relations,
herdaed Professor Whilaker for partaking in the
recent L'affair Stevenson Petition. It was a sly use
of the University name, he contended. He warned
students to beware of organizations, and cited his
experience ul the University of Wisconsin where
debate grew so heated thai students were threatened
with immersion into the ice-packed lake. Troxell,
quite emotional, warned that this must not he per
mitted to occur at Stanford.
Virgil K. Whitaker, head of the Department of
English, was the only panel member to be granted
