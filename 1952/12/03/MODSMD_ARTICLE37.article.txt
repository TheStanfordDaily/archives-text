### Pete Grothe 
II Prols Vucinich, Mazour, Bark and their history dept. cronies don't
mind our infringing on their territory, we'd like to observe an historical
li end.
It's t)lis .. . that next year Stanford should enter a Golden Age in
fi>otljall and basketball. Unfortunately, beardless youngsters right now
romping through their senior year in high school will be on the Farm to
enjoy the good tidings in place of we oldsters in the Class of '53, but we
can't begrudge them this pleasure.
First, let us properly bury the subject of football for the year. It is
our conviction that the grid year '52 was the interim period between one
champion and another possible champion. Kind of like the Middle Ages
between Caesar's Roman Empire and the 'Napoleon's conquests.
'I'he material looks strong; for next .\Yar, despite the loss of some good
mill. At ends there are Sam Morley, John Steinberg, Ron Buslj, Dick
Stern*, and John Stewart. John I.udeke and l)iik Gant look like a strong
pair of offensive tackles, and John Stanton and Harry Smith will he tops
on defense. Joe Sappcnficld. the best in a good crop of frosh linemen,
will figure strongly here, as will big StevÂ£ Doctor who hiay he shilted
front end to tackle or linebacker.
The guards look particularly strong with All-American candidate Norm
iVlanoogiun coining back and scrappy Phil Wilson anchoring down the other

offensive guard spot.. Sophomores Matt Ar
mitage and Win Wedge should be two of the
most effective defensive guards in the league
next year. Paul Revak, John Roberg and Roy
Ki'ickebtrg will lend depth. Soph Jerry Gold
berg should have a great year at center with
AI Robertson to assist. Ted Tanner is an All -
Coast possibility at linebacker and Marsh
1 lo w<-, Manny Vanderlip, and Tom McKenna
art* football players who will make that posi
tion solid.
The quarterback slot is loaded, with Bobby
Garrett, Jack Gebert, and Mike Acker re
turning and Don Kafka coming up from the
lrosh. .Backs Bill Rogers, Ron Cook, Jarvis

Watson, Jim Stewart, and Mike Anderson all return from this year's team
with sensational Jim Truher coming up from the frosh. Yearlings Bill Tarr,
and Harry Sykes will also help out.
The big problem again is finding three defensive backs who know how
tn bat down passes. The only one who really looks like a cinch to make
11 is Don Sanders, who played first string on the Rose Bowl team as a
freshman. Dick Monteith, Dave Castelueci, urTtl Jack Rannells are con
tenders, and probably someone will be switched from offense or will go
both ways.
The big question, of course, is Bob Mathias. If he changes his mind
ami decides to play it might mean the difference between a good team and
a Kose Bowl team. At his rate of improvement this lost fall, he could
easily make All-American next year.
Here is what is important: If Chuck Taylor so desired, he could field
a team next year on which 20 of his starting 22 players were first stringers
either this year or last (Manoogian and Sanders.) This is an item which
cannot he overlooked, especially when it is considered that Cal, USC,
UCLA, and Washington are much harder hit by graduation.
The basketball squad, like the football team, is looking for its champion
ship next year, not this. The only two seniors on this year's team are
Paul Johnson and George Zaninovich. Athletes of real promise like Russ
Lawler, Dave Epperson, Don Carlson, Ron Tomsic, Olie SuzdalefF, and Don
DeLong all return. Also add freshman George Selick, who was voted most
valuable player in the CIF last year. He's only 5' 8" and 135 pounds, but
lie's potentially one of Stanford's greatest basketball players.
UCLA should be heavy favorites to take the basketball crown this
year. Stanford will go into the conference race underdogs, a position which
is' much to their liking. They're going to knock off a lot of the big ones
litis year. They did Monday night.
Three athletes came of age last Monday. Their names, Epperson, Zanino
vitch, and Carlson. Epperson showed that he's going to go a long way in
filling the monstrous vacuum left by the graduation of Jim Ramstead.
Carlson, the athlete that every member of the coaching staff (football,
basketball, and track) says could be an all-time Stanford great if he
really wanted to, wanted to last Monday! He gave forth with a spectacular
backboard game and for the first time in his varsity career at Stanford
showed that he had it.
Also, a big plaudit for George Zaninovich who comes from a town on
the outpost of civilization called Delano. Last year, George was an un
polished gem. He had great potential, but he lacked finesse. This year,
lie is much smoother and is probably the only fi' 2" hoopster in the country
who can dunk a ball.

SUGGESTED READING DEPT. Excellent reading material is Jim
Scott's book entitled ' Bob Mathias, Champion of Champions." It's on sale
in the bokstore. Another good book: "The Stanford Axe." published by
Pacific Books.
Speaking of books, we have received many requests by people in search
n! Christmas presents to put some more autographed copies of "Great
Moments in Stanford Sports" on sale. Bob Mathias was good enough to
autograph 50 more, so a very limited number of copies will go on campus
sale at the Engineering Corner on Thursday.

We can't put this column to bed for the quarter without throwing an
orchid to Zeke Wallace. His performances this year merited a Rose Bowl,
and his stint at the Big Game Rally was the best I've seen in four years on
the Farm.
