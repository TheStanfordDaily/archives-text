# Freshmen Will Receive New Rushing Handbooks
## Eating Clubs 
### 
The eating clubs' new handbookâ€”
24 pages of pictures and commen
tary will be distributed to fresh
men and other potential rushees
Monday and Tuesday nights, it was
announced yesterday by the Inter
club Council.
The handbook, edited by Sam
Kre.slunan, member of F.I Tigre. de
cribes Ihe activities and traces the
history of each of Stanford's seven
eating clubs.
The Interclub Council, meeting
Monday night, set up a $700 reserve
fund to be used by all the clubs.
The clubs expect to add to the fund
during the Christmas holidays when
the K1 Tigre club room is turned
over to players on the All-Star West
football team.
The Interclub Council, in other
action, decided to discuss-with Uni
versity officials the possibility of
constructing an all-cating club dor
mitory.
Plans for converting the large
fields behind the club building into
a play area were also discussed.
The play area will contain basket
ball and volleyball courts. No con
struction date was set.
The council also decided that the
hiring of hashers is to be handled
individually by each club. Club
managers last year recommended
that an interclub hiring procedure
be established, but the council held
such a plan impractical. The coun
cil further decided that each club
would conduct its own rushing pro
gram and that there would be only
one interclub activity, the open
house slated for Jan. 9.
