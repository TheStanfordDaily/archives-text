# DR. CALLUP ON CAMPUS
## Probes Polling Errors 
### HADLEY ROFF 
Dr. George H. Gallup, direc
tor of the American Institute of
Public Opinion, explained why
the pollsters failed to predict
the Republican landslide in the
last election when he visited
the campus yesterday.
C.Jhllup said that pollsters were
too cautious in guessing How inde
pendent or undecided voters would
vole in tli'" last election, figuring
they would cast ballots as they had
in the past when sweeping Demo
era lie landslides were registered.
Thirteen per cent of the voters
[ ran he counted as independents,
Gallup said. He reported that tie
had figured they would vote about
three to one for Adlai Stevenson,
the Democratic standard hearer.
Instead thev voted strongly for
General Dv, ighl Eisenhower, the
< itll' candidate.

"resting up after the election." 112 te

One of the great products of the
(dec!ion as far as polling is con
cerned, t .allnp said, is the devel
opment of the pin-point sampling
method. Siirh a system, he de,
elared, is almost error proof. In
(lit- future, lie predicted, political
inns will he figured with greater
< ei t;iinly.
Speaking of the recent election, hp

They hesitated because a shift to
Steven-on was noted soon after the
beginning of active campaigning
last September. Gallup said poll
showed thai in September Eisen
hower could • count on 59 per cent
ol the voters, while lie garnered
only M per 11 of the vote in the
November elect ion.
The independents, he feels,
swung like ;\ pendulum—lirst to
ward Eisenhower, then toward
Stevenson, then bark to Eisen
hower. lie thought that Kfccn
luiwcr's promise to go to Korea
! and the dramatic election-eve Re
publican broadcast and television
i show had much to do in pushing
the independents hack into the
(•Ol* column.
Gallup reported that research or
ganizations similar to his American
Institute are now operating in 12

Of deep concern l'i lUO,t na

mated war in Korea. He said tint
most nations laud America's stand
in fhe bomb-scarred Asiatic pe
ninsula. but feel thai South Ko
reans should be trained and
equipped to take a creator part
in the fighting.
The well - known pollster com
plained that American military and
political leaders have too long ig

He said dial a large proportion
of those polled in America and other
countries advocated MlO intensive
arming of ihr South Koreans siy
months before the policy was hist
urged by Eisenhower. Such a time
ing is characteristic of modern poli
tics, he asserted.
