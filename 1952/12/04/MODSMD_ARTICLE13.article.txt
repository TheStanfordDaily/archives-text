(UP)—The United Nations Gen
eral Assembly, overridinq tho
Soviet bloc, today voted Una I
approval of India's pe.ico
plan and offered it to the Chi
nese dnd Reds as d
means of endinq the wai.
By a vote of 54 to 5, with Na *
tionalist China abstaining end the
Sovie' blor opposing, the power fv<l
Assembly adopted the Indian pro
posals as offiHal UN policy on Ko
rea. It requested Assembly Pies=i
dent Lester B. Pearson of Canad t
to dispatch them to the enemy fight
ing in Korea
Pearson was asked to repott
l»ack to the Assembly on
Reds' reaction "as soon as appro
fiiatc,'' but it. was generally an
Hcipatcd that any further UN a<
tion would await the second hall
«»! the Assembly session, which >.
tentatively slated, to convene eailv
in February after the inaugura
tion of President-ele<t Dwight D
Eisenhower.
• After the today, American,
delegate Ernest A Gross pledged
that the United States would "exert
every effort to carry out loyally an'l
completely the provisions of thi-i
tesolution."
Expressing hope that tho Red 3
would accept the new UN off?!,
Gross said;
"Despite the feeling of despan
inspired by Mr. Vishinsky's pes
emptory rejection of these propo
sals . . i we believe . . , that no
nation ean lon/? withstand their
resistible moial force of world
opinion.
"The people of the U.S . who
have played so greet a part in th c
Korean struggle, are united with
the other peoples of the world in
a prayer that the Communists win
accept the proposal which we arc
making to them today."
Today's vote firmly endorsed the
princlple that there must be no for •
cible repatriation of war prison"!
It was thus a significant victory for
the U.S. and its Allies in Korea who
had previously taken that stand.
And because the resolution was au
thored by an Asian power >tap
peared likely to reap special propa
ganda dividends for the West in
Asia, even though Communist re
jection of it might doom its rharrr ,
of ending the' Korean war
Vishinsky once more denounced
the Indian plan and insisted that
the UN adopt his own formula call
ins for an immediate cease-fire with
a Red-packed commission later tr»
decide how to repatriate all war
prisoners.
But the Assembly again rejected
Russia's approach, which amount ;
to forcible prisoner repatriation
Thr vote in most case-* was 4<« to
5 with 9 abstentions.
