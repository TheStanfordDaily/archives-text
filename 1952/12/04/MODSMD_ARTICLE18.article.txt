# Stanford's Social Problems
## 
### 
Tuesday the YWCA's freshman Activities
Committee sponsored a panel discussion on
Stanford's procedure. This was the first
attempt to bring men and women together to
discuss social attitudes of the student body as
a whole.
Of course every living group—both mens'
and womens' — has discussed social policy
separately. There is a feeling among several
ot the administration and among certain Stan
foid student body leaders that our school is
growing and in this growing process some ot
our traditions of friendliness and enthusiasm
for mixers, informal parties, and schoolspon
sored dances is rapidly disappearing. Some
j>eoplfr are concerned.
The Tuesday panel, designed primarily for
freshmen, for that is where college social at
titudes start, attempted to discuss two ques
tions. It was not a rate-your-date session as
some people suposed.
These questions were:
I. Where are the opportunities at Stanford
'<ii college people to get to know each other?

Classroom acquaintances aie dwindling; liv
ing group parties are not always a satisfactory
solution.
2. Why don't exchanges and mixers woik at
Stanford? These ale Junctions where students
ran become better acquainted.
Vice President hlllie Myers, our social policy
director, has heard favorable comments on ex
changes from social chairman, but she has
heard many criticisms, too.
There are certain misconceptions: "Fix
changes are date bur da us." And Stanfoid Uni
versity is "a marriage bureau." Perhaps our
illustrious iaiio is too overplayed and too over
Jated.
The panel was only a sampling of freshman
opinion. But the attendance and discussion
showed that there are some definite gripes on
the situation.
What caji be done? Do you feel that a social
problem exists here? Are there enough on
campus parties and dances? Your student
body officers would like to hear your com
ments. Ruby Bernstein
