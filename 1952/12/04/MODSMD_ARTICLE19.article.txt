HttVV TO Hi: A WHEEL
PART TWO
Most interviewers have some
sort of objective rating system
which they use to help them pick
fellow committee members. Rah
Rah Com has a one, two, three

system. First all those who are scorea one receive
positions, then a few who are rated two are appointed
to do the work, while the threes are advised to try
out again next year.
In thft case of females the system works as fol
lows; attractive and dumb (one), attractive and in
telligent (two), unattractive (three).
Por nitres it is slightly different. Group one con
sists of those who seem to be most like the interviewer
in dress, taste, and trade-in-value of convertible.
Group two are those suited to doing menial tasks
without asking questions. Group three is composed
of those who could satisfactorily answer all questions
and appeared capable of asking a few embarrassing
ones 011 their own.
At (his point It is appropriate to offer a few Stig

gestionis on how to prepare yourself for the inter
view. Definitely wear a cashmere sweater and while
hocks, he sure to wash your face, and in the case
of hoys wear light weight grey Hamtel slacks, how
ever in the case of girls a skirt might he advisable. -
If you don't possess any ol" these items try to bor
row them from someone on the committee.
Find out the chairman's home state and then claim
that you come from Podunk, lowa just 1,200 miles
away and are practically neighbors (this always gets
a laugh unless the previous applicant said the same
thing).
Be sure to quote the names of lots of ASSU officers
and committee men who went to your high school
even if they didn't, (he chances are that (he inter
viewers have never met them any way.
Above all be casual. If the meeling is not in
Memorial Church oiler a cigarette before they offer
one to you and use a lighter instead of a match.
Try to appear interested in the committee. If you !
can find out what it does be sure and emphasize that
you have had lots of experience in this Held. In the
event that it is impossible to find out what it does
just emphasize that you have a very light schedule
and lots of experience in administration.
Don't appear too eager; such things as licking the
chairman's hand, or bowing from the waist when leav
ing the room are now frowned upon as being un
democratic. Always try to smile and be sure to laugh
at anything a committee member says. Girls should
be friendly with the males and men should stare ap
preciatively at (he females.
This information should give the try-outee sufficient
background to begin applying for positions. The im
portant thing to remember is that like any other skill,
joining a committee depends 011 constant practice.
The firsl committee is the hardest to crack. Once ap
pointed to one, the others will be easy prey fo your
polished technique and new found confidence.
