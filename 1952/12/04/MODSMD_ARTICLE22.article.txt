The tmy individuals who
pom out ol the tiny robin's egg
blue schoolhouse on the uppei
end of the Row every afternoon
about 3 are Stanford through
and through.
At almost any hour of the day
several pint - sized human beings
can be found in the Encina Cellar
"or the Union, ordering a coke right
along the side ol a red-coated rough
And alter almost every athletic
practice the weary athletes are de
prived of their warm showers for u
.moment \vhile a herd of four-foot
high youngsters procure their auto
graphs.
Winfield Christiansen, principal of
(lie Stanford Campus Elementary
School, believes that his school re
flects the leeling and influence ol
University life more than any other
grammar school in the Bay Area.
The school's athletic enthusi
j asms are closely knitted to the
athletic program of the Stanford
BAC. The children watch with
enthusiasm as football floats are
built, and share the freshman's
mental trials as the Di,'j Game
bonfire is rising from*l,ake Lag.
Because ol their nearness to the
campus, the children enjoy many
cultural benefits that most students
don't get until much later in their
education.
A short time ago Dr. Malcolm
IVIillcr of (he Stanford Anatomy
Department (old the children
about lizards. Last week Dr. Ben
jamin Page of the Geology De
partment told them about earth
quakes.
Every week Matt ICuhn of the Art
Department and his wife operate an
after-school arts and crafts pro
gram for over 100 students in cera
mics, weaving, metal work, and
painting.
When Mr. Christiansen first be
came principal of (be little school
house, be worried about the bad
influence the neighboring frater
nity bouses might have on his stu
dents. To his delight, however,
the Kow men have been excellent
neighbors.
"The traffic situation at Santa
Ynez and Mayfield Avenues is our
only serious problem," he says. "Too
frequently campus cars go through
the stop signs, and sometimes even
past the flag.s the children hold out."
"II is doubtful if you could find
more loyal supporters anywhere
than the children who attend the
Stanford Campus School," Mr,
Christiansen smiles.

School, believes that his school re
flects the leeling and influence ol
