### WES MARX 
In a return match of the mural
football playoffs yesterday, Theta
Chi beat Phi Psi in an overtime anc
will lace the Zetes today at -I. Win
ner of the contest will face the Phi
Kap.s in the mural championship on
a date yet to be decided,
A que.stion of player eligibility
nullified a previous contest in which
the Phi Psi's won over Theta Chi in
another overtime and caused the
rematch. This time it was a Theta
Chi victory, but the two games leave
iiu doubt that both teams are on a
near-even par.
Mural overtimes are decided by

the team which gains the most yard
age on one set of downs. The Phi
Psi's in their try netted eight yards,
due to a Ben Swan completed pass
to Harvey King. With Fred Chez
pitching, Theta Chi proceeded to ex
plode in their set of downs. Hefty
Bob Morris caught a strike and ram
bled for 15 yards. On the next play
Chez sighted Creighton Mills un
spotted by pass defenders l>o yards
downfield and threw. caught
the aerial and crossed the goal-line.
The Theta Chi yardage was over
whelming.
A (5-(J deadlock led up to the score
as rushing linemen harassed pass

plays of both teams. In the first half j
Chez completed a 20-ynrd pass score j
to Mills. Phi Psi's, touchdown in the i
second half was set up by Bill Coe's
capture of a Theta Chi bobble on
the 20. Eight plays later Phi Psi i;ot
through Theta Chi's previously un
scored-upon defense as Swan caught
Don Ilanson in the end zone with a

pass.
Theta Chi will now face the
Zetes to decide the lower bracket i
finalist which will meet the up
per bracket victor, the I'lli Kaps,
in the mural championship. The
Phi Kaps qualified for their posi
tion yesterday by decisioning :
Kappa 14-6. Loyd Kelly !

threw I'D passes to Pete Pitsker
and Dick Sark as the defending
champs won their tenth straight
game sy>ainst no defeats. The
Kappa Sigs worked hard to upset
the Phi Kaps, but it was not to
be done. Sterling Clayton threw
a .touchdown pass for the lone
Kappa Sig score.

time. —Daily photo by Vernon Dunn
