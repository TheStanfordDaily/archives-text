Wr have never been one to change horses in the middle of the stream
hut this iiiurning in writing our final effort of the quarter we couldn't
resist placing at the top of what follows a new column head drawn by
Willard Miillin, one of the Nation's top sports who draws for the
N.Y. World Telegraui and Sun, The St. Louis Sporting News, as well as
othrr top publications. Don't hold him responsible for the mug shot; that's
the work of Glenn Erickson, a top-notch staff photographer (when he has
.something to work with). We bow to both for their generosity.
And now that we have seen how the column head looks in print, we shall
cany on and attempt to present some excuse for beginning this whole
business today,

This morning we launch a crusade to open the Men's Gymnasium on
Sunday afternoons. Al Masters, Director of Athletics and controller of
such things has assured u» that if the demand is present the gym will
he opened on Sundays despite the added financial cost.
It is now closed on Sundays because the demand has not warranted the
cost of lighting and supervision.
We feel and we could be wrong that there is a demand for the gym,
especially on Winter Quarter Sundays when outdoor activity is limited
and when basketball courts could be available for intramural practice, and
other facilities open for workouts.
11 you feel as we do that the gym should be open for workouts, intra
mural cage practice, and recreation on long Winter Sunday afternoons let
us know about it.
Written word to us from mens' houses, clubs, and living groups, giving
support ot our project would be turned over to Mr. Masters and if sufficient
iet.ponse is received the gym can be opened Winter Quarter if action is
taken now.
We feel there is the demand to have the gym open on Sundays. But it is
in your hands, we could be wrong.

We have never heard the Pavilion so spirited as when we whipped the
Dons Monday night. The USF side of the house roared early in the game,
the Card side the latter portion.
The USF enthusiasm is not based alone on their desire to win, but
the game was the Dons first opportunity to cut loose since last January.
USF doesn't have a football team. The reason is obvious for the din from
the Stanford side. The comeback of the cagers was a great one, and one
which has many thinking that boss-man Bob Burnett has come up with
a lot more this year than at first was expected.
Though USF was a test, it was only the first one. Conference play
doesn't get underway until January 2 and 3 when the Indians host USC.
Stanford goes north this weekend to play Oregon at Eugene.
Then they knock off for Finals and return to the courts Dec. 20 when
they tangle with LaSalle University at the Cow Palace. United Press has
liaSalle ranked third in the nation.
Then it's back home for the Olympic Club on the 23rd, down to play
San Joke State on Dec. 2Gth, and Loyola of Los Angeles in the same spot
the next night. And the Cards put in their final pre-conference appearance
back in the Cow Palace when they meet Oregon State on the 29th.
The schedule affords Bay Area fans and Stanford students an op
portunity to see the Indians in action. Stanford is passing up their usual
holiday out-of-state-trip hut will go to Hawaii for a series of games
Jan. 21, 23, and 24.

We have never heard the Pavilion so spirited as when we whipped the
Dons Monday night. The USF side of the house roared early in the game,
the Card side the latter portion.
The USF enthusiasm is not based alone on their desire to win, but
the game was the Dons first opportunity to cut loose since last January.
USF doesn't have a football team. The reason is obvious for the din from
the Stanford side. The comeback of the cagers was a great one, and one
which has many thinking that boss-man Bob Burnett has come up with
a lot more this year than at first was expected.
Though USF was a test, it was only the first one. Conference play
doesn't get underway until January 2 and 3 when the Indians host USC.
Stanford goes north this weekend to play Oregon at Eugene.
Then they knock off for Finals and return to the courts Dec. 20 when
they tangle with LaSalle University at the Cow Palace. United Press has
liaSalle ranked third in the nation.
Then it's back home for the Olympic Club on the 23rd, down to play
San Joke State on Dec. 2Gth, and Loyola of Los Angeles in the same spot
the next night. And the Cards put in their final pre-conference appearance
back in the Cow Palace when they meet Oregon State on the 29th.
The schedule affords Bay Area fans and Stanford students an op
portunity to see the Indians in action. Stanford is passing up their usual
holiday out-of-state-trip hut will go to Hawaii for a series of games
Jan. 21, 23, and 24.

Wr have never been one to change horses in the middle of the stream

Willard Miillin, one of the Nation's top sports who draws for the
N.Y. World Telegraui and Sun, The St. Louis Sporting News, as well as
othrr top publications. Don't hold him responsible for the mug shot; that's
the work of Glenn Erickson, a top-notch staff photographer (when he has

This morning we launch a crusade to open the Men's Gymnasium on
Sunday afternoons. Al Masters, Director of Athletics and controller of
such things has assured u» that if the demand is present the gym will
he opened on Sundays despite the added financial cost.
It is now closed on Sundays because the demand has not warranted the
cost of lighting and supervision.
We feel and we could be wrong that there is a demand for the gym,
especially on Winter Quarter Sundays when outdoor activity is limited
and when basketball courts could be available for intramural practice, and
other facilities open for workouts.
11 you feel as we do that the gym should be open for workouts, intra
mural cage practice, and recreation on long Winter Sunday afternoons let
us know about it.
Written word to us from mens' houses, clubs, and living groups, giving
support ot our project would be turned over to Mr. Masters and if sufficient
iet.ponse is received the gym can be opened Winter Quarter if action is
taken now.
