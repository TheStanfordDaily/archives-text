, apply for a grant-in-aid, outright
gifts of money given each year

| by the University and alumni
1 to needy students.
The only academic requirement
for the grants is a C average or
J better. Scholarship record is sec-
I ondary, however, and the main fac
l tor considered is tlie extent of the

student's financial stress.
Most of the yrants run about $100
or less, but aid as high as $200 has
been given.
Students wishing to apply fi.r
grants may submit applications
any time during the year.
Undergrads may pick up ap
plication blanks at the oiliee of
the Scholarship Committee, 111-G,
Inner Quad. Completed blanks
should he turned in at the same
oflice.
Grad students should apply
through Ernest R. Hilgard, Dean of
(he Graduate Division.
Applications for aid are reviewed
by the Commission for Student Aid,
a subcommittee of the Scholarship
Committee. Two iaculty members
and three undergrad students are
on the Commission.
Situations most likely to receive
favorable consideration are (hose
in which financial dilliculties have
arisen as a result of some unfore
seen emergency, such as illness or
accident.
In addition to funds made avail
able to all students by the Univer
sity, there are certain restricted
funds, usually the gifts of individ
uals. For example, two grants are
available exclusively to undergrad
uate engineering students from the
Edward Bacon Fund and the School
of Engineering Grant-in-Aid Fund.
Grants from these funds arc usually
smaller (about $50) but arc also
easier to qualify for.
Still more funds are especially
earmarked for the deaf, war vet
erans, and orphans.
