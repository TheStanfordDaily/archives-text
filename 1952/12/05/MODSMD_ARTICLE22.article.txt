The Stanford Players production of "The Bluo Bud," Maetor
j lincke's symbolistic fairy tale, was given its opening performance
' of a three-day run in a sparsely filled Memorial Auditorium last
night. The audience attending contained few Stanford students.
The story itself is a dream sequence in which two children are

of tangible mikl intangible values,
and animate and inanimate objects.

have its redeeming features. The

They, alone, would be worth !he
price of admission. Likewise, ihe
music was excellent and fitted into
the story perfectly, and James Krush,
Hazeile Wilson. Leonard Ratner. and
John Hunt should be acclaimed for
this contribution.
