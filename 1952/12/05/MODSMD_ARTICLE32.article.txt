To the Editor:
As one of the "apathetic" student members of the
Symposium on academic freedom I would like to com
mend Mr. Schiller for his interest in this vital issue
shown by his letter to the editor (Dec. 3).
I feel that many of his criticisms of the panel are well
founded. Perhaps the discussion was too specific, and
perhaps we did not deal sufficiently with the more
important aspects of the Communist hysteria in Ameri
can universities. I would therefore, like to extend the
discussion and answer Mi'. Schiller's question: "What
will happen if we permit all teachers suspected of
Communist sympathies to continue in their present
capacities?"
Such a statement of the question reveals Mr. Schil
ler's assumption that Communists, recognizable as
such, are now teaching in American universities.
If this is the case, is not the American student in
telligent and objective enough to use these men's
teachings as a means of broadening his own under
standing of Communism and Communist methods?
Then, will he not be able to compare our ideals of
democracy favorably with those of Communism?
Or do you assume that the average studc-nt is not
incapable of recognizing these Communists and will
he subverted? If so the answer lies in an encourage
ment of political inquiry in classes enabling students
to develop their critical faculties. If, however, in an
attempt to get rid of Communists we further curtail
academic inquiry by, for example, the fear and in
limidation resulting from Loyalty Oaths, how can we
train students to be. strong enough to really stand
against Communism?
Or are you airaid, Mr. Schiller, that our democracy
< annot it and up against such intensive scrutiny?
