To the Editor;
With regard to the somewhat misleading and veno
nous account of the debate on intellectual and aca
lemic freedom given by Reader M. V. Schiller (the
Daily, Dec. 3) we would be grateful if the following
:orreetions could be made known.
Mr. Schiller does not show the remarkable attitude
-112 "fair play" which inspired the debaters however
livergent their opinions may have been.
It is quite incorrect to describe the students who
(( tended the meeting as "apathetic." There wasn't any
•ow, or other picturesque show of contrasting opinions,
>ut the interest of both the members of the Faculty
md the students, among whom many were foreign, was
genuine and lively.
It is of course a matter of opinion to regard the
discussion as "superficial" and our own impression
was that of a good and stimulating, if incomplete,
exposition of ideas. It seems to us that the idea of
a public debate 011 the subject of intellectual freedom
in the American democracy today is an excellent one.
Like all new ideas, it is not perfect, but we feel that
it ought to he more encouraged rather than just
flatly criticized.
Finally, I-feader Schiller's personal remarks about
the members of the panel seem unfortunately to con
firm Prof. Troxell's humorous suspicion that perhaps
in America—as, add we. in some other parts of the
world —there still is more freedom than intellect.
JEAN DE GROO'I HE (Univ. of Bruxelles)

F'.S. Lest our own letter may sound too "venomous"
may we add that we would be very glad to meet
Marvin V. Schiller and exchange with him our points
of view on the debate and its main issues.
