# Differs With Kreps
## 
### 
To the Editor:
There comes a time in (lie academic life of every
undergraduate, when he refuses to believe everything
his professors tell him, when he finds ideas he is unable
to swallow. I felt this way when I read Dr. Kreps'
political views in Monday's Daily, and as this matter
is one of politics, I feel I may safely speak my mind.
Dr. Kreps' first point was that our biggest worry is
the domination of the U.S. by the miiltary, or as he
puts it, "A general in the White House, and a Cabinet
full of generals and an H-bomb in each hand."
Nothing could bo further from the truth, as ran
be shown by recent events of which the Doctor seems
to he unaware. Eisenhower has repeatedly advo

rated a cut in military spending to a figure of $50
billion, the same figme the Doctor advocates. To get
even this much the military has to come, hat in hand,
to Congress. The Congress is still, I believe, a civilian
organization, the atom bomb and the H-bomb, which
the Doctor fears will be wielded with such careless
ease by the military, cannot be used without the ex
press permission of the Atomic Energy Commission,
another civilian organization.
As proof of the onrushing tide of militarism, Dr.
Kreps relates that 50,000 civil servants are leaving
Washington D.C. per week. Although some obvious
flux is due to the change in administration, his estimate
as to the number involved is too ridiculous even for
comment.
Dr. Kreps' second major point was that our economy
is "so strong that not even an Eisenhower can wreck
it." This statement in the face of an already inflated
currency, deficit spending, a national debt somewhat
in excess of $260 billion, plus a costly war witli no end
in sight, would seem to be political and economic day
dreaming.
The type of thinking that Dr. Kreps indulges in, 1
am sure, leaves many undergraduates wondering as
to their professors' knowledge of the practical side of
economics and politics.

am sure, leaves many undergraduates wondering as
to their professors' knowledge of the practical side of
economics and politics.
