# On Civil Servants
## 
### 
To the Editor:
With due respect to Dr. Kreps, whom I do not know,
I cannot let the article containing his views go by
unmentioned.
Does he not sound very foolish in saying that civil
servants are leaving Washington at the rate of 50.000
a week; "right now, two-thirds of.all your bureaucrats
are civilians attached to the lWilitary, and this will get
worse in the next few years"; there will be a cabinet
full of generals With an H-bomb in each hand, etc.?
Anyone who has lived in Washington, D.C., for a
reasonable length of time realizes that "civil servants,"
if under Civil Service, will remain on their jobs re
gardless of the man 01 party that ascends to power.
They are in those jobs because they have been se
lected in a competitive system that rewards your good
work in a satisfactory way, be it a fancier title or
more money. These are the thousands of people who
interview, type, file, analyze, write government pub
lications, etc. These are the civil servants. Some, it
is true, may lose their jobs; but more than likely, it
will be because their jobs cease to exist. And perhaps
the majority, of those lew who do become jobless, will
be many minor officials who are not actually on Civil
Service, and whose main occupations consist of "plan
ning" and "policy farming."
... I question the statement about two-thirds of
the bureaucrats being "attached to the military." What
does this mean? Are they military, but in disguise?
. .. Maybe this heinous crime is where the bureaucrats'
troubles lie. But have riot all men served their country
in a military capacity of one or another sort since the
dawn of history?
... I can only say that if there are generals in the
cabinet who clutch H-bombs, then, indeed, Russia is
winning the ideological war, which pictures such tripe
in the gay, colored cartoons of "Krokodil," "Izvwstia,"
etc. Yes, if you believe all the pictures you see, indeed,
such an impression of the cabinet would be valid.
If a populace is periodically told that il is in danger,
it becomes convinced that its position in world politics
is vulnerable.
In world politics, the most common way of lessening
vulnerability is increasing the size of military forces
on. active duty. II Eisenhower and Stevenson will steer
courses that are about the same, why is a White House
general and his cabinet to be feared more than a White
House governor and his cabinet? Since Eisenhower it
expected to be "steering a middle course," he will be
little different from what most others would do. If the
recent election showed a trend to the police state
and yet Eisenhower and Stevenson would steer es
sentially the same course—that is, the middle—then
we are in 110 greater danger from the Eisenhower
victory than we would have been from a Stevenson
victory.
Has Dr. Kreps done an "about-face," or does he
march in two directions at once? You cannot march
in two directions in a vertical plane at the same time.
Review your drill, Dr. Kreps; you will need il badly
in the coming garrison state.
