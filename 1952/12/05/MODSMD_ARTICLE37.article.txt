UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN—
The Wisconsin Badgers, co-champs
of the Big Ten, have accepted the
bid to face USC in the Rose Bowl,
Jan. 1, but their band may not be
on hand to add color to the Pasa
dena affair.
Professor Kay Dvorak, director
of die band, sa>s his tvoop will
not perform unless someone foots
(lie bill for new uniforms and
travel expenses. Sounds simple.
That is, until vou hear the amount
of the bill: just a cool $50,000,
Dvorak estimates. Well, we were
getting tired of half-time stunts
anyway.
* * $ 1 12.
UNIVERSITY OF OREGON- The
library at the (J. of Oregon has a
reputation for being a pretty hot
place. And just to prove it, a re
porter for the student daily paper
recently took a thermometer in with

him to get specific figures on the
subject.
Temperatures ranged from a
high of 87 degrees to a low of 75.
A junior woman interviewed by
the reporter claimed that it was
so hot that she went into the libe
with a copy of "The drapes of
Wrath" and came out with a
"handful of raisins."

DARTMOUTH COLLEGE — A
certain dorm was put on probation
recently after broken glass appeared
in the hallways and the third Hoor
was Hooded under inches of water.
The cause of the Hood was easily
explained—a water fight. Origin of
the glass, however, was a little more
obscure: seems that the undergrad
uates were bowling in the corridors
and using bottles as tenpins.
Commented the student judi
ciary head: "Apparently the reo
rients had been saving their bottles
for a long time."
