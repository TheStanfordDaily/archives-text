# Unseen Stanford

DOWN UNDER
The smoke that is rising from
seemingly nowhere all over campus
these winter mornings doesn't mark
the birth of a new group of "Old
Faithfuls." It's just Stanford's un
derground heating system making
itself seen, as hot pipes, damp
ground, and cold air combine to
send up clouds of steam.
In the steam plant across fvom
the BAC, technicians like Mike
Ilahcr (top) control a complex
system of pipes and conduits which
relay steam heat from Lag to Mem
Aud, and from the Post Oflicc to
Encina.
Three-and-a-half-foot tunnels like
the one to the left extend all the
way around Inner Quad as far as
the Mining Engineering Building
and the Art Gallery, and from En
cina to Scqouia. They sometimes
house telephone and electric light
wires as well as the steam pipes.
In past years the tunnels have
served for entrance into Hoover
Tower and made possible such es
capades as last year's 2 a.m. ring
ing of the Tower Bells.
However, Lester Mclnnis, steam
plant foreman, says there's no truth
in the popular rumor that the steam
tunnels to Roble were walled ofT
because so many Encina roughs
used them to break into the Roble
basement. Lag and Roble, he said,
have always been heated by a con
duit pipe rather than by the tun
nels. â€”Daily photos by Jack Byrne
