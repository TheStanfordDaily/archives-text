## Cards Ignored on West Shrine Club 
### 
We have watched with interest the selections made by the EAST-WES P
SHRINE GAME committee for their annual crippled children's bent/.'
all star game to be played in San Fiancisco, this year, on Saturday, Decem
ber 27.
And for the first time in many and many a year the West team does not
have a member from Stanford, but Stanford is represented. Chuck Ta\ lor
is assisting Washington Head Coach Howie Odell in handling the Western
collection of all-stars.
We phoned Babe Hollingbcry, Chairman of the West Selection Com
! mittee, yesterday in San Francisco, and he told us that this year as seldom
before, Stanford has a shortage of seniors. And being a senior is a re
quirement for being asked to play in the benefit game.
The absence of a Stanford name from the West lineup will disappoint
1 Indian followers who like to root for their "boys'" in the battle of the greats.
However the lack of departing seniors is indicative of the amount of material
Chuck Taylor will have to work with next fall and is some compensation
for Stanford's failure to place in the Shrine game.
In fact there were only two names from Stanford seriously considered
for invitations. One was Mr, Robert Mathias and the other was Chuck
Essegian.
"Mathias wasn't invited" Hollingbery told us, "because although ho has
declared he will not play for Stanford next year there is always the possi
bility that he might change his mind. And if he played in the Shrine game
he could not go back ot college ball. Because we wish to keep Iriendly
relations with Bay Area coaches, we did not approach Mathias as Chuck
j may still be counting on Bob next year."
The other name that was before the West selection committee was Es
segian. His name was submitted by Taylor himself when the Stanford boss;
wired Odell to request consideration of Essegian for the Shrine game, which
Taylor believes is the only justified or worthwhile post season bowl.
But the selection committee concluded that there were better linebacker:"
' and Essegian could not be fitted into their plans which limit the number
j of players to 25.
If the West wins, and these annual classics are always tossups, there
will be no credit payed to Stanford players but a great deal of praise will
fall about Chuck Taylor for in this game as in no other the coaching stall
must do a tremendous .iob in a very short time.
The West squad which draws the b N e,st players from all the Western
I states will assemble at Stanford, where the West sets up camp each year,
on Dec. 20. The game is Dec. 27. That leaves six days of practice with time
out for Christmas. It is up to the coaching staff to weld these individual
greats into a single'unit. It is a tough order and all coaches share there
sponsibility. Chuck can carry his share in good style.

The Stanford footballers as a team have recently been asked to play a
Holiday game in Hawaii. But the Department of Athletics turned down the
I invitation of the Islanders. Stanford's football uniforms have been cleaned
and are stored away for many a month.

The Stanford footballers as a team have recently been asked to play a
Holiday game in Hawaii. But the Department of Athletics turned down the
I invitation of the Islanders. Stanford's football uniforms have been cleaned
and are stored away for many a month.
We have watched with interest the selections made by the EAST-WES P
SHRINE GAME committee for their annual crippled children's bent/.'
all star game to be played in San Fiancisco, this year, on Saturday, Decem
ber 27.
And for the first time in many and many a year the West team does not
have a member from Stanford, but Stanford is represented. Chuck Ta\ lor
is assisting Washington Head Coach Howie Odell in handling the Western
collection of all-stars.
We phoned Babe Hollingbcry, Chairman of the West Selection Com
! mittee, yesterday in San Francisco, and he told us that this year as seldom
before, Stanford has a shortage of seniors. And being a senior is a re
quirement for being asked to play in the benefit game.
The absence of a Stanford name from the West lineup will disappoint
1 Indian followers who like to root for their "boys'" in the battle of the greats.
However the lack of departing seniors is indicative of the amount of material
Chuck Taylor will have to work with next fall and is some compensation
for Stanford's failure to place in the Shrine game.
In fact there were only two names from Stanford seriously considered
for invitations. One was Mr, Robert Mathias and the other was Chuck
Essegian.
"Mathias wasn't invited" Hollingbery told us, "because although ho has
declared he will not play for Stanford next year there is always the possi
bility that he might change his mind. And if he played in the Shrine game
he could not go back ot college ball. Because we wish to keep Iriendly
relations with Bay Area coaches, we did not approach Mathias as Chuck
j may still be counting on Bob next year."
The other name that was before the West selection committee was Es
segian. His name was submitted by Taylor himself when the Stanford boss;
wired Odell to request consideration of Essegian for the Shrine game, which
Taylor believes is the only justified or worthwhile post season bowl.
But the selection committee concluded that there were better linebacker:"
' and Essegian could not be fitted into their plans which limit the number
j of players to 25.
If the West wins, and these annual classics are always tossups, there
will be no credit payed to Stanford players but a great deal of praise will
fall about Chuck Taylor for in this game as in no other the coaching stall
must do a tremendous .iob in a very short time.
The West squad which draws the b N e,st players from all the Western
I states will assemble at Stanford, where the West sets up camp each year,
on Dec. 20. The game is Dec. 27. That leaves six days of practice with time
out for Christmas. It is up to the coaching staff to weld these individual
greats into a single'unit. It is a tough order and all coaches share there
sponsibility. Chuck can carry his share in good style.
