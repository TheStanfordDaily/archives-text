! Minor lergue baseball faced full
| dress action against it in the courts
today when it turned down a pro

operates.
In the busiest convention session
to date, the minors also unanimously
' approved a new rule governing
I bonus players, voted to extend a
j high school rule which permits club
! owners to talk to players as long as
they do not sign them to contracts,
and put teeth in the option rule to
proven shuttling of players back and
forth between the majors and mi
nors to evade player limits.
Prentice Wilson, a youne attor
ney representing Dick Burnett,
the Dallas owner, said. "Frankly,
! we are seeking a liearir,«y for the
I good of professional ba-eball

among the representatives of tlu*
National Association of Minor
Leagues to consider the whole
structure of the g?me.'*
"Unless we get that, the Dallas
club will be forced to seek equitable
relief elsewhere, since men always
have fouyht lor and will continue to
fight for the protect.on and preset
vation of their properly rights," lie
said.
