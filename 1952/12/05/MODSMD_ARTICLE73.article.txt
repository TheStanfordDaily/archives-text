# English Foreign Scholar Is ‘Versatile Participant’
## 
### WIN GRIFFITH 
Ron <Hall, A S S U foreign
scholar from Smethwick, Eng
land, is a different person to dif
ferent students.
To those who watch some of Stan
lord's "minor" sport teams perform,
he is the fast and agile co-captain of
this year's soccer team.
To listeners of station KZSU, he
is the warm, jocular voice that in
troduces "Cardinal Classics."
To the "grand bunch of chaps" who
host hi in at the Deke house, he is
an' individual who fits easily into !
some of the non-academic activities 1
of Stanford students.
Itut the 211-year-old history grad I
student is more than a versatile
participant in extra-curricular ac
tivities. As an Englishman who j
hopes (and plans) to he a mem- I
her .of the English parliament j
someday, he has come to America [
as an observer who wants to "un- !
derstand the actions and the atti- !
tudes of the American nation."
"In England," liall says, "we let
the Communists have their sa.y
and. for the most part, we laugh
at them. Here you suppress the j
Communists to such an extent that !
you know very little about them." 1
He believes that there is an "Ivory I
Tower" atmosphere at Stanford, and \
cites the lack of a "well attended '
debating society" as the result.
"Americans are interested in the <
world outside the United States," .
Hall says, relating that in recent j
bull sessions Stanford students have I
shown a strong interest in the people j
and affairs of this country.
Like most of the other scholars in
Hie ASSU foreign scholarship pro
gram. Hall acknowledges "America's

huge place in international politics."
He thus places his year of academic
training at Stanford secondary in im
portance to his "duties" of scrutiniz
ing the American people and letting
interested students learn something
about England.
Hall is outspoken in expressing
some of his views about the United
States. Since his arrival in New
York last September lie has been
aware of what he calls the "ma
terialist attitude" of Americans, an
attitude to strive for "mass en
tertainment." an attitude which
tends to "keep the people from
thinking for themselves."
He is also amazed by "America's
excessive fear of communism," and
he believes that such fear could

,inean that the Unitize! States has
'total it aria 11 characteristics."
"But t /' me * .'an press docs
not five nearly as much emphasis
to the affairs of England as the
English press gives to American
events."
And because of this "inadequate
coverage" (he ASSU scholar hopes
that he may bring soire of the
English (and European) attitudes
in the attention of the Americans
with whom he associates this year.
Hall expresses two of those atti
tudes by the following comments.
"The great concern of most Euro
jeans is the possibility that Ameri
ca's lcndership might be blundering
he western world into a third world
var. With the recent change of ad
ninistration in the U.S., the fear it
greater than ever."
"Americans do not understand
British socialism. They do not
realize that socialism is necessary
for Britain and that (he welfare
state, in checking poverty, is a
strong deterrent to communism."
Hall's manner docs not indicate
that such comments arc offered »>
derogatory criticism. 11 i > perspective
is that of an Englishman who h
discovering new (and surprising)
ideas and situations.
Next June, the foreign scholar
will have completed his work for
an M.A. degree and will return to
England to share his knowledge of
America with his own people. Ilis
specific, long-range plans include
establishing himself with some
reputable London business firm
and working for the Conservative
party there.
Hall expects that he will qualify
as a candidate ior a parliamentary
seat in about ten years. When and
if that seat is his, Stanford's foreign
scholarship committee may foel thai
the choice of Ron Hall as a foreign
scholar was well justified.
"Leadership ability" was strongly
considered in the acceptancc of Hall
as one of this year's eight scholars,
