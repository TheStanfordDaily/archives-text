enjoy the return
of the ' Weskit"
Long a popular eastern fashion, the odd vest or waist
coat has been adopted by California men for sports
events, informal evenings, cocktail parties-even lor
business in the more subdued patterns.
Besides being a chill-chaser on colder days, its
real fun to dress up a conservative suit with tins gay
touch for parties, holidays, - for most any time.
Shown now in tiny checks, bold tattersalls, solid
tone corduroys, and plain velvets with sport buttons
Easily worth their new low price just for the tun you 14
have thru the holidays.
