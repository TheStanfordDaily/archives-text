ABOARD LINER QUEEN MARY, Jan. 4 (UP) —Prime Minister
Winston Churchill sailed jauntily through high seas today on the
last lap of his voyage to New York, where he will hold a shipboard
press conference as soon as this liner docks (today) Monday
morning.
He was expected to emphasize the "holiday" nature of his visit,

and'to point out that he will be
turning later in the year with a full
delegation to discuss world pi-oblems
with the new administration of
Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Members of his staff suggested he
was only utilizing his holiday trip to
Jamaica to stop by and pay courtesy
and completely informal calls on his
old friend, Eisenhower, and President
Truman.
Ship's officers were warned that as
many as 100 newsmen might meet
the ship early tomorrow by cutter.
Churchill was preparing for a barrage
of questions.
Churchill was expected to be ques
tioned on Korea, British rearmament
spending, his new "quality before
quantity" defense policy, the British
attitude toward the McCarran Immi
gration Act, and Premier Josef
Stalin's recent suggestion that he
would be prepared to meet Eisen
hower for a discussion of world ten
sions.
Churchill was not expected to say
much on the Korean question, par
ticularly before he has talked with
Eisenhower on the President-elect's
recent Korean visit.
After a late and hearty breakfast,
Churchill set to work in his bedroom
on notes for the conference. He will
receive the scores of newsmen in the
starlight grill of the liner about
8:30 a.m.
A stream of cables from London
daily to news broadcasts on the radio
especially installed in his suite.


CONFIDENT —Britain's Prime Minister Winston Churchill gives
the familiar "V" sign as he boards the liner Queen Mary at
Southampton, England, for trip to the United States. Churchill
will visit President Truman and hold conferences with Presi
dent-elect Dwight Eisenhower.
