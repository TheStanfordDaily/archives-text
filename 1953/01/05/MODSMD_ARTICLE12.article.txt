# Varsity Basketballers Collapse Before Trojans
## 
### LARRY CAHN Daily Sports Editor 
While reg lines mark the start of a new quarter, "school is just
about out" for the Stanford cagers in the Southern Division race,
as the men of Bob Burnett dropped a pair of conference openers
to USC over the weekend.
The double loss, 75-58 Friday and 72-63 Saturday, to the Trojans,

a team that was figured to be no
better than Stanford and below the
ability of Cal or UCLA, dropped the
Indians into a last-place tie with
UCLA, twice victims of a good
California club.
The word's around that the In
dians will now be doing well to
win any of their conference games
and might end up with no wins,
12 losses. This is based on the
thought that to lose two on your
home court to a club that is the
weakest in the loop besides your
self is not the basis for a win
sprinkled season. And when the
locals next meet the Trojans it
will be down south and the pros
pects of beating UCLA or Cal
anywhere are slim.
The Friday game was no contest
from the very start with the Forrest

Twogood lads jumping to a fast lead,
building it to 20-11 at the quarter,
and pausing for the intermission
with a nine-point 32-23 lead.
The game was never in doubt
as an unusually fast breaking,
clean USC five outplayed and out
manned the Indians, who this year
are not running but rather are
playing a ball-control game. This
year it was the Trojans who
broke fast, and it was also the
Trojans who used a second pla
toon, similar to the one innovated
by Stanford last year, to give the
first-stringers a short rest after
building up a lead.
The Indians found themselves
completely cut off from the offensive
backboard, and when a shot was
missed it was lost to Troy. Stan
ford's ace shooter, Ron Tomsic, who
averaged 20 points in pre-season
tilts, was held to 12 counters by
Kenny Flower, SC's fine all-around
ballplayer and a deserving candi
date for All-American honors.
It was Oleg Suzdaleff, Stanford's
fjne floor man, who turned shooter
for the evening, who kept the In
dians in the ball game at all as he
hit 19 points and tied the Trojans'
Dick Welsh for the night's high
point total.
Following the half, the Trojans
zoomed to a 40-25 lead and toward
the end of the third period the
Cards chopped the gap to nine
points, 63-54, but could do no more.
Saturday's game saw a different
cast of characters for Stanford, a
bit better story, but alas, the same
ending. Burnett, in hopes of get
ting more scoring from his front
line, inserted Don DeLong and
George Zaninovich at the forward
spots in place of footballer Sam
Morley, who seems to lack some
thing on a basketball court, and JC
transfer Wayne Culberson, who is
fast approaching a good ballplayer
and shows much hustle.
And this pair coupled, with G-ft.
6-in. Russ Lawler, who replaced
lethargic Don Carlson at center,
gave the Indians a vastly improved
scoring punch and the best Burnett
has been able to get from his for
wards all season.
Zaninovich, who is a real bat
tler and likes the rough stuff, hit
brilliantly for seven points in the
opening quarter, but no one else
could find the range and the In
dians fell behind 15-9 at the ten
minute mark.
But with Tomsic, Lawler, Zanino
vich, a hustling DeLong hitting
well, and a zone defense replacing
a man-to-man holding the Trojans
more in check, Stanford evened the
count at 32-32 at half-time as Tom
sic drove the length of the court to
tally the equalizer at the gun.
The Trojans came right back in the
third period and shooting well, from
outside the zone, something they
had not done before, they burst into
a lead which was never in danger.
Trojan center Roy Irvin tanked
eight points in the third period to
pace the attack.
Tomsic did put on a one-man
exhibition of sharpsliooting at the
end of the third and beginning of
the fourth quarters, hitting a free
throw and four fine buckets from
the edfte of the key and the cor
ner to personally jump the Card
side of the scoreboard from 45 to
53. But by this time SC had 60
and time was running out.
All through the game, and espe
cially the fourth stanza, Troy's Ed
Simpson was sneaking through the
Indian defense for lay-ins, tips, and
jump shots to lead the Trojans with
20 while Tomsic was high for the
evening, collecting ,23 before fouling
out with a minute to go.
For the series, USC's Flower was
high with 37, Simpson followed with
36, and Tomsic scored 35.
All in all, Stanford showed
marked improvement in hustle,
scoring, and all-around play Sat
urday and Burnett seems to have
somewhat solved his front - line
shooting weakness with DeLong,
Zaninovich, and Lawler, who
combined to gather 33 points while
on Friday Morley, Culberson, and
Carlson could muster only 11.
Next week it's the red hot Bears,
Friday at California and Saturday
right back here.

a lead which was never in danger.
Trojan center Roy Irvin tanked
eight points in the third period to
pace the attack.
Tomsic did put on a one-man
exhibition of sharpsliooting at the
end of the third and beginning of
the fourth quarters, hitting a free
throw and four fine buckets from
the edfte of the key and the cor
ner to personally jump the Card
side of the scoreboard from 45 to
53. But by this time SC had 60
and time was running out.
All through the game, and espe
cially the fourth stanza, Troy's Ed
Simpson was sneaking through the
Indian defense for lay-ins, tips, and
jump shots to lead the Trojans with
20 while Tomsic was high for the
evening, collecting ,23 before fouling
out with a minute to go.
For the series, USC's Flower was
high with 37, Simpson followed with
36, and Tomsic scored 35.
All in all, Stanford showed
marked improvement in hustle,
scoring, and all-around play Sat
urday and Burnett seems to have
somewhat solved his front - line
shooting weakness with DeLong,
Zaninovich, and Lawler, who
combined to gather 33 points while
on Friday Morley, Culberson, and
Carlson could muster only 11.

RON TOMSIC and DON CARLSON
—Look consistently good in losing

While reg lines mark the start of a new quarter, "school is just
about out" for the Stanford cagers in the Southern Division race,
as the men of Bob Burnett dropped a pair of conference openers
to USC over the weekend.
The double loss, 75-58 Friday and 72-63 Saturday, to the Trojans,

a team that was figured to be no
better than Stanford and below the
ability of Cal or UCLA, dropped the
Indians into a last-place tie with
UCLA, twice victims of a good
California club.
The word's around that the In
dians will now be doing well to
win any of their conference games
and might end up with no wins,
12 losses. This is based on the
thought that to lose two on your
home court to a club that is the
weakest in the loop besides your
self is not the basis for a win
sprinkled season. And when the
locals next meet the Trojans it
will be down south and the pros
pects of beating UCLA or Cal
anywhere are slim.
The Friday game was no contest
from the very start with the Forrest

Twogood lads jumping to a fast lead,
building it to 20-11 at the quarter,
and pausing for the intermission
with a nine-point 32-23 lead.
The game was never in doubt
as an unusually fast breaking,
clean USC five outplayed and out
manned the Indians, who this year
are not running but rather are
playing a ball-control game. This
year it was the Trojans who
broke fast, and it was also the
Trojans who used a second pla
toon, similar to the one innovated
by Stanford last year, to give the
first-stringers a short rest after
building up a lead.
The Indians found themselves
completely cut off from the offensive
backboard, and when a shot was
missed it was lost to Troy. Stan
ford's ace shooter, Ron Tomsic, who
averaged 20 points in pre-season
tilts, was held to 12 counters by
Kenny Flower, SC's fine all-around
ballplayer and a deserving candi
date for All-American honors.
It was Oleg Suzdaleff, Stanford's
fjne floor man, who turned shooter
for the evening, who kept the In
dians in the ball game at all as he
hit 19 points and tied the Trojans'
Dick Welsh for the night's high
point total.
Following the half, the Trojans
zoomed to a 40-25 lead and toward
the end of the third period the
Cards chopped the gap to nine
points, 63-54, but could do no more.
Saturday's game saw a different
cast of characters for Stanford, a
bit better story, but alas, the same
ending. Burnett, in hopes of get
ting more scoring from his front
line, inserted Don DeLong and
George Zaninovich at the forward
spots in place of footballer Sam
Morley, who seems to lack some
thing on a basketball court, and JC
transfer Wayne Culberson, who is
fast approaching a good ballplayer
and shows much hustle.
And this pair coupled, with G-ft.
6-in. Russ Lawler, who replaced
lethargic Don Carlson at center,
gave the Indians a vastly improved
scoring punch and the best Burnett
has been able to get from his for
wards all season.
Zaninovich, who is a real bat
tler and likes the rough stuff, hit
brilliantly for seven points in the
opening quarter, but no one else
could find the range and the In
dians fell behind 15-9 at the ten
minute mark.
But with Tomsic, Lawler, Zanino
vich, a hustling DeLong hitting
well, and a zone defense replacing
a man-to-man holding the Trojans
more in check, Stanford evened the
count at 32-32 at half-time as Tom
sic drove the length of the court to
tally the equalizer at the gun.
The Trojans came right back in the
third period and shooting well, from
outside the zone, something they
had not done before, they burst into
a lead which was never in danger.
Trojan center Roy Irvin tanked
eight points in the third period to
pace the attack.

Saturday's game saw a different
cast of characters for Stanford, a
bit better story, but alas, the same
ending. Burnett, in hopes of get
ting more scoring from his front
line, inserted Don DeLong and
George Zaninovich at the forward
spots in place of footballer Sam
Morley, who seems to lack some
thing on a basketball court, and JC
transfer Wayne Culberson, who is
fast approaching a good ballplayer
and shows much hustle.
And this pair coupled, with G-ft.
6-in. Russ Lawler, who replaced
lethargic Don Carlson at center,
gave the Indians a vastly improved
scoring punch and the best Burnett
has been able to get from his for
wards all season.
Zaninovich, who is a real bat
tler and likes the rough stuff, hit
brilliantly for seven points in the
opening quarter, but no one else
could find the range and the In
dians fell behind 15-9 at the ten
minute mark.
But with Tomsic, Lawler, Zanino
vich, a hustling DeLong hitting
well, and a zone defense replacing
a man-to-man holding the Trojans
more in check, Stanford evened the
count at 32-32 at half-time as Tom
sic drove the length of the court to
tally the equalizer at the gun.
The Trojans came right back in the
third period and shooting well, from
outside the zone, something they
had not done before, they burst into
a lead which was never in danger.
Trojan center Roy Irvin tanked
eight points in the third period to
pace the attack.
Tomsic did put on a one-man
exhibition of sharpsliooting at the
end of the third and beginning of
the fourth quarters, hitting a free
throw and four fine buckets from
the edfte of the key and the cor
ner to personally jump the Card
side of the scoreboard from 45 to
53. But by this time SC had 60
and time was running out.
All through the game, and espe
cially the fourth stanza, Troy's Ed
Simpson was sneaking through the
Indian defense for lay-ins, tips, and
jump shots to lead the Trojans with
20 while Tomsic was high for the
evening, collecting ,23 before fouling
out with a minute to go.
For the series, USC's Flower was
high with 37, Simpson followed with
36, and Tomsic scored 35.
All in all, Stanford showed
marked improvement in hustle,
scoring, and all-around play Sat
urday and Burnett seems to have
somewhat solved his front - line
shooting weakness with DeLong,
Zaninovich, and Lawler, who
combined to gather 33 points while
on Friday Morley, Culberson, and
Carlson could muster only 11.
Next week it's the red hot Bears,
Friday at California and Saturday
right back here.


RON TOMSIC and DON CARLSON
—Look consistently good in losing

While reg lines mark the start of a new quarter, "school is just
about out" for the Stanford cagers in the Southern Division race,
as the men of Bob Burnett dropped a pair of conference openers
to USC over the weekend.
The double loss, 75-58 Friday and 72-63 Saturday, to the Trojans,

a team that was figured to be no
better than Stanford and below the
ability of Cal or UCLA, dropped the
Indians into a last-place tie with
UCLA, twice victims of a good
California club.
The word's around that the In
dians will now be doing well to
win any of their conference games
and might end up with no wins,
12 losses. This is based on the
thought that to lose two on your
home court to a club that is the
weakest in the loop besides your
self is not the basis for a win
sprinkled season. And when the
locals next meet the Trojans it
will be down south and the pros
pects of beating UCLA or Cal
anywhere are slim.
The Friday game was no contest
from the very start with the Forrest

Twogood lads jumping to a fast lead,
building it to 20-11 at the quarter,
and pausing for the intermission
with a nine-point 32-23 lead.
The game was never in doubt
as an unusually fast breaking,
clean USC five outplayed and out
manned the Indians, who this year
are not running but rather are
playing a ball-control game. This
year it was the Trojans who
broke fast, and it was also the
Trojans who used a second pla
toon, similar to the one innovated
by Stanford last year, to give the
first-stringers a short rest after
building up a lead.
The Indians found themselves
completely cut off from the offensive
backboard, and when a shot was
missed it was lost to Troy. Stan
ford's ace shooter, Ron Tomsic, who
averaged 20 points in pre-season
tilts, was held to 12 counters by
Kenny Flower, SC's fine all-around
ballplayer and a deserving candi
date for All-American honors.
It was Oleg Suzdaleff, Stanford's
fjne floor man, who turned shooter
for the evening, who kept the In
dians in the ball game at all as he
hit 19 points and tied the Trojans'
Dick Welsh for the night's high
point total.
Following the half, the Trojans
zoomed to a 40-25 lead and toward
the end of the third period the
Cards chopped the gap to nine
points, 63-54, but could do no more.
