# Varsity Basketballers Collapse Before Trojans
## 
### LARRY CAHN Daily Sports Editor 
While reg lines mark the start of a new quarter, "school is just
about out" for the Stanford cagers in the Southern Division race,
as the men of Bob Burnett dropped a pair of conference openers
to USC over the weekend.
The double loss, 75-58 Friday and 72-63 Saturday, to the Trojans,

a team that was figured to be no
better than Stanford and below the
ability of Cal or UCLA, dropped the
Indians into a last-place tie with
UCLA, twice victims of a good
California club.
The word's around that the In
dians will now be doing well to
win any of their conference games
and might end up with no wins,
12 losses. This is based on the
thought that to lose two on your
home court to a club that is the
weakest in the loop besides your
self is not the basis for a win
sprinkled season. And when the
locals next meet the Trojans it
will be down south and the pros
pects of beating UCLA or Cal
anywhere are slim.
The Friday game was no contest
from the very start with the Forrest

Twogood lads jumping to a fast lead,
building it to 20-11 at the quarter,
and pausing for the intermission
with a nine-point 32-23 lead.
The game was never in doubt
as an unusually fast breaking,
