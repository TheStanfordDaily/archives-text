# Co-Rec Dance Is Saturday
## 
### 
"Winter Whirl" is the theme of
an all-campus dance which will be
held Saturday night from 9 to 1
in the Women's Gym.
Tickets for the Co-Rec-sponsored
dance are $1.98 per couple. Dress
will be casual, since most students
will arrive directly from the Stan
ford-Cal basketball game.
The Rhythm Venders will supply
dance ' music in the main gym.
Square dancing will be featured in
the small gym. Ping pong, card
games, and entertainment are also
planned.
Chairman of the Co-Rec dance is
Joanie Bramson.
