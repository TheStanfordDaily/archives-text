# IS STANFORD ON HIS LIST?
## McCarthy Will Probe Colleges 
### HADLEY ROFF Daily Political Editor 
An intensive, full-scale Sen
ate investigation of possible
Communist influence on college
campuses, private institutions
as well as state, currently is be
ing mapped by Sen. Joseph R.
McCarthy (R., Wis.), new head
of the Senate Committee on
Government Operations.
McCarthy revealed his plan to
scrutinize the nation's colleges last
week in an interview with editors
of the weekly news magazine U.S.
News and World Report.
He told the editors that, if other
members agree, "We are going into
the school system."
A similar probe of the school
system is being planned by Kcp.
Ilarold 11. Vclde, chairman of the
House Un - American Activities
Committee. Veldc, also inter
viewed bv the U.S. News and
World Report, said he believes
education to he a "very fertile
field" for investigation.
Velde said his committee would
examine "all fields of education,"
including the privately supported
schools.
( In his interview with the news

magazine officials, McCarthy said
he prefers to use the term "Com
munist thinker" instead of "Com
munist" when referring to sub
versive elements in the nation. He
did not define, however, what
shades of thought he includes in
"Communist thinking."
McCarthy, as head of the Com

mittce on Government Operations,
the Senate's official investigating
arm, is in a position to launch any
number of Red-hunting investiga
tions. He told editors of U.S. News
and World Report that several in
vestigations were being planned and
that "what, I hope to do is to conduct
a preliminary investigation of any
complaint made by any Senator."
On June 25 of last year, McCar
thy, looking forward to control of
the Senate's powerful investigating
committee, told a reporter for the
Washington Daily News:
"Leavenworth Federal Peniten
tiary won't hold all the officials
I'll send there if I become head
of the Special Investigating Com
mittee in 1953."
When discussing the proposed
school probe, McCarthy said, "Wc
w«'t have any power to order any
Communist professors fired, or any
thing like that," but implied that it.
was his driving intent to shine "the
bright light on them and stir them
up until . . . we can have a real
hou^e-cleaning."
He said such a sweeping inves
tigation would he"the most un
popular and the most unpleasant
task anyone can do . . . because
the minute you do that all hell
breaks loose. From coast to coast
you hear the screaming of inter

fercncc with academic freedom."
When asked if an investigation of
the nation's education facilities
would promote "thought control,"
the Senator pooh-poohed the idea,
replying, "Of course, the minute you
start exposing Communists in
schools you will ho accused of that.
The real thought control in schools,
he asserted, came from Communist
instructors and professors who must
toe the rigid Moscow line.
. . You and I know full well,"
he claimed, "thai there is no free
dom of thought, no freedom of ex
pression on Ihe pari of a Commu
nis! teacher. His thinking is set
forth for him and if he deviates
one iola he is out of Ihe party."
"So," the Wisconsinite concluded,
"that's a completely false claim that
you're interfering with freedom of
thought, freedom of expression
when you get rid of Communists.
The person who is trying to get rid
of them and get good honest Ameri
cans in your schools and colleges is
the man who is trying to promote
freedom of thought and expression
in college."
Velde, Ihe House prober, said he
also anticipates vigorous com
plaint, particularly "from (he left
wing educators."
Velde said his committee plans to
make the school probe theif prin
cipal function.

Ilarold 11. Vclde, chairman of the
House Un - American Activities
Committee. Veldc, also inter
viewed bv the U.S. News and

education to he a "very fertile
field" for investigation.
Velde said his committee would
examine "all fields of education,"
including the privately supported
schools.
( In his interview with the news

magazine officials, McCarthy said
he prefers to use the term "Com
munist thinker" instead of "Com
munist" when referring to sub
versive elements in the nation. He
did not define, however, what
shades of thought he includes in
"Communist thinking."
McCarthy, as head of the Com

mittce on Government Operations,
the Senate's official investigating
arm, is in a position to launch any
number of Red-hunting investiga
tions. He told editors of U.S. News

vestigations were being planned and
that "what, I hope to do is to conduct
a preliminary investigation of any
complaint made by any Senator."
On June 25 of last year, McCar
thy, looking forward to control of
the Senate's powerful investigating
committee, told a reporter for the
Washington Daily News:
"Leavenworth Federal Peniten
tiary won't hold all the officials
I'll send there if I become head
of the Special Investigating Com
mittee in 1953."
When discussing the proposed
school probe, McCarthy said, "Wc
w«'t have any power to order any
Communist professors fired, or any
thing like that," but implied that it.
was his driving intent to shine "the
bright light on them and stir them
up until . . . we can have a real
hou^e-cleaning."
He said such a sweeping inves
tigation would he"the most un
popular and the most unpleasant
task anyone can do . . . because
the minute you do that all hell
breaks loose. From coast to coast
you hear the screaming of inter

fercncc with academic freedom."
When asked if an investigation of
the nation's education facilities
would promote "thought control,"
the Senator pooh-poohed the idea,
replying, "Of course, the minute you
start exposing Communists in
schools you will ho accused of that.
The real thought control in schools,
he asserted, came from Communist
instructors and professors who must
toe the rigid Moscow line.
. . You and I know full well,"
he claimed, "thai there is no free
dom of thought, no freedom of ex
pression on Ihe pari of a Commu
nis! teacher. His thinking is set
forth for him and if he deviates
one iola he is out of Ihe party."
"So," the Wisconsinite concluded,
"that's a completely false claim that
you're interfering with freedom of
thought, freedom of expression
when you get rid of Communists.
The person who is trying to get rid
of them and get good honest Ameri
cans in your schools and colleges is

Velde, Ihe House prober, said he
also anticipates vigorous com
