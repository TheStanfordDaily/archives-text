# Clubs Begin Rush Period Wednesday
## 
### 
Stanford's seven eating clubs kick
off their '53 rushing program with
open houses in each of the clubs
Wednesday night.
Following the open houses, each
of the clubs will hold invitational
meals to acquaint rushees with the
individual groups.
To be eligible to participate in
the rushing program, a student must
have completed one quarter—other
than summer — at Stanford. The
program is aimed not only at fresh
men, but also toward transfer stu
dents and others interested in
pledging one of the seven clubs.
Dick Bennett, Interclub president,
is chairman of the rush program.
He emphasizes that the clubs use
no formal pledging procedure. A
club may extend an invitation at
any time, and a man may pledge by
simply accepting the bid.
General information about the
individual clubs, their organization,
facilities, and role in Stanford life,
is printed in the Club Manual dis
tributed to all freshmen in Encina,
Toyon, and the Village before the
Christmas vacation.
The seven clubs and their rush
ing chairmen are as follows: Los
Arcos, Thornton Garrett; Breakers,
Bob Margolis; El Campo, Kip Nicol;
El Capitan, George Toepfer; El Cua
dro, Eric Elesser; Ei Tigre, Clarence
Gardiner; and El Toro, Herb Po
leski.
