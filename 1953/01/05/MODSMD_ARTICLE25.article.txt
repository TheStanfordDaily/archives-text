■ Some suggested New Year's resolutions
for persons in public places:
DWIGHT EISENHOWER—To continue as-
:■.?i ling his own professed "Liberal Republican"
ii liefs over those of the Taft wing of his party
. . . and to remember, when making peace
v/ith men like Taft and Mac Arthur, not to con
fuse tactful reconciliation with giving in.
HARRY S. TRUMAN—To aid, not hinder, the
president-elect in his attempts to restore dig:
nity to the presidency, remembering that there
,'!■ times when the welfare of the country is
more important than partisan politics.
DOUGLAS MACARTHUR —To remember,
before making another public statement like his
rc ent one concerning Truman ("How anyone
could use such a bloody drama as the Korean
/, r as a means of self-glorification is guite
!, yond my comprehension"), the old saying
übout people in glass houses. . , .

JOHN FOSTER DULLES- To temper his talk
about "action" in the Cold War with the knowl
edge that many foreign leaders live in con-!
stant dread of the United States' performing
some rash act that might plunge the world into |
a Third World War.
THE NEW CONGRESS—Amid its talk of gov-;
ernmental reorganization and budget-cutting,

enough says nothing about maintaining an eco
nomical and hyper-efficient government . . . j
its words are "to promote the general welfare." j
ADLAI STEVENSON -To change his mind j
about his current intentions to slip away guietly
into private life and to answer the pleas of the
many who have written and telegraphed him
