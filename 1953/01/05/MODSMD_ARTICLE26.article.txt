### MOVIES VS. REAL LIFE PETE GROTHE 
Things always happen two ways . . . the way they
(ii n'' in Ihe movies and the way they happen in real
ill' First we take an example from real life:
Chief Gordy Davis, the poor man's Dick Tracy, is
if ttii!j, in his chair in the closet of a Corp Yard, better

known as the police dept. A short
freshman with thick glasses and
five books under his arm enters
,md addresses Chief Gordy:
"Is this where I pay for my
parking ticket?"
"Yes."
"But I didn't sec the 'No Park
in,"' sign."
"That'll be two dollars, please."
"Okay.
"Thank you. and come again."

That's the way it happens in real life. If the Holly
<Â»<! moguls came to Stanford, the same scene might
b< depicted the following way:
The scene takes place in Chief Gordy Davis's spa
l ious hickory-paneled office on the fifth floor of the
Stanford Police Station. A police sergeant bursts in
nd shouts to the Chief (played by Humphrey Bogart):
Chief, Chief, Chief!"
'Steady, boy. Get a hold of yourseff. What is it''"
"Just this, Chief. Two history professors and an
I !i-h prof were just strangled and thrown into the
bottomless depths of Lake Lag."
Davis: "Well, 1 was working on the case of the arson
i who buined down -Centura and the Deke house,
I .nt t lis does seem m cie important. Bring in the
ii. poets."

"Okay, Chief."
The first man to come in is a short freshman with
thick glasses and five books under his arms. The
freshman (played by Mickey Kooney) says, "Hon
estly, chief, I didn't see that 'No Parking' sign."
Chief Davis: "Hey, this is no suspect. He's just a
parking violater. That'll be $220, 60 lashes, and 30
days. Take him away. Now bring in the first suspect."
"Okay, Chief."
The first suspect is a gray-haired lady with a shawl
around her shoulders. She is a house mother.
Chief Davis: "You are suspected of having love
affairs with these men. You killed them, didn't you."
The lady (played by Ethel Barrymore): "No, be
cause they were all killed after 10:30 p.m., and I was
in by then. Just ask the committee of seven."
Chief: "Okay, bring in the next suspect."
The second suspect is a gracl student in the psych
dept., played by Peter Lorre.
Chief: "You killed them, didn't you?"
"Yes."
"Why?"
"Because they flunked me, and I couldn't stand it
any longer, so what was there I could do but strangle
them? But you'll never get me. I'll jump out the win
dow. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."
He jumps out the window and Davis watches the
sidewalk break his fall. Then he orders the sergeant:
"Have someone clean up that crimson mess down
there."
"Okay. Chief, but we just got a report that an arson
ist burned down Hoover Tower."
"Hmmm," allowed the Chief, -"theVe's never a dull
moment around here."
