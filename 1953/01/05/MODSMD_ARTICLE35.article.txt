Next they returned home where
they lo«t to La Salle 95-80, in a
Cow Palace thriller. Ron Tomsic
and Don Carlson put on a real show
against the Explorers, one of the
two or three top squads in the na
tion. Tomsic hit 15) points, although
he sat out most of the contest with
four fouls, and Carlson raked both
backboards and dumped in 15 points,
but class prevailed *ind the La Sai
lers put on a fourth-quarter burst
to win. All-America candidate Tom
Gola shot seldom, and still managed

Stanford's basketball team fared
disastrously in holiday tilts. Even
San Jose State beat them! After
their Dec. 1 win over USF, .they
dropped five straight games before
beating Loyola. Then they lost to
Oregon State and finished with the
Trojan double defeat. Their over
all record is now two and eight.
After winning their hectic opener
over USF, 74 to 73, they journeyed
to the northland where they were
dumped by Oregon, 73-68 and 74-64.

to amass 21 points.
Next a Pavilion contest saw the
revamped Olympic Club take the
Cards, 93 to 75. Ex-San Jose Staters
George Clark and Norm Giles
sparked the Clubbers.
Stanford was next the victim of
San Jose State, 68-62. It was the
first time San Jose State had beaten
the Cards since 1947. The Cards got
back on the winning trail briefly
agaihst Loyola of Los Angeles. The
Loyolans had only lost one before
the Indians beat them, 65 to 57.
The Cards warmed up for their
double-drubbing at the hands of the
Trojans with a 58-46 defeat at the
hands of a slow-moving Oregon
State quintet.
The one bright spot in the vaca
tion contests for the Cards was the
shooting of soph guard Ron Tomsic.
Win or lose, Tomsic always man
aged to get his points. For the four
games from the Olympic Club
through Oregon State, Tomsic
tanked 95 points. At the end of
Stanford's first ten games, Tomsic
has an even 200 points.
