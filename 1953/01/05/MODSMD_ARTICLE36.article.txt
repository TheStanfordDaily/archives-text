## The 						Small-Time Grid Problem 
### 
San Jose State stands alone in the local world of independent football,
following the grid abandonment over the holidays by our good neighbor
Santa Clara. Santa Clara followed St. Marys and USF in tossing out the
game that a small school can no longer support.
And will San Jose follow suit? There's no telling. With three key oppo
nents already dropped from football the Spartans will be hard-pressed to
put together a good schedule, one which will be financially sound and yet
within bounds of the school.
There seems to be only two preservatives of small-time football: (1) the
outlawing of the platoon-type of play, (2) the forming of a league comprising
the smaller schools.
Outlawing Platoons Is the Best Answer
Outlawing platoons seems to be the better of the two solutions as all
schools would then, by lack of necessity for big star-studded squads, reduce
their proselyting. In hopes of banning the free-substitution rule several
conferences, including the Pacific Coast Conference, have instructed their
representative to the National Rules Committee to urge restricted substitu
tions and perhaps return to the old system that prohibited a player from
returning to the game in the same quarter in which he already played. This
seems a bit too severe but it can be expected that some move to limit substi
tution will eventually be made. In fact something definite may come from
the NCAA convention which gets underway in Washington on the 6th.
But with the possibility that nothing comes from the NCAA meet we feel
the alternative is for the schools to organize among themselves a league, one
which would limit proselyting, would cut out training tables and spring
practice, would restrict more than one intersectional affair and would forbid
j members from competing in post-season games. Such a league would per
! Mit football for fun if that is what the schools want and if that isn't what
they want then we dpn't pity their present status as non-combatants. The
schools with small enrollments have no right to expect to field teams that
can compete with the like of even Pacific Coast Conference schools.
A League of Independents
A league of the independents could consist of Santa Clara. USF, St. Marys,
San Jose State, Fresno State, COP and perhaps Nevada. With each team
playing a round-robin schedule plus one intersectional with a team in its
own class, a very neat but short grid schedule could be worked out. the
entire deal commencing with the opening of practice in mid-September
when the schools open, the first game to be played in the second week of
October and the sked concluding just about the same date as the last Satur
day in PCC competition.
Games could be played on Friday or Saturday nights. Such scheduling
would not interfere with Sunday professional games and Saturday's top
collegiate affairs. Both San Jose's stadium and Kezar in San Francisco are
outfitted with lights. So is the Oakland ball park which has been offered
rent-free for such use. Night games would in all probability draw suffi
ciently to cover expenses.
If the schools want national recognition and financial return, then they
have tried all means and have been choked into abandonment, but if they
are looking for football for fun and only the revenue necessary to cover
expenses of an abbreviated, de-emphasjized program than a conference
among themselves would be the solution provided no radical change is made
in the free-substitution rule.
And now that Santa Clara has dropped the sport, who is going to take
her spot on Stanford's home schedule which had the Broncos opening in
I the stadium in late September? The Indians might let the date slip by and
then again they may try to get a top-notch club like Navy, Oklahoma or

j Ohio State. Don't bet on it. If a filler
[ is rushed in. it could well be College
of Pacific, a more-than-worthy oppo-
I nent, but also an independent who is
wavering toward abandonment.
And Chuck Taylor is already one
down in grid picking, as immediately
after the Big Game he picked his
j Indians to whip the Broncos in the '53
i opener.
