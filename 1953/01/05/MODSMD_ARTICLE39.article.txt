The Stanford Library Staff Asso

early last month.
Dr. van Patten, nationally known
as a bibliographer and librarian, re

August. He was the Director of
University Libraries at Stanford
from 1928 to 1947. Since then he
continued to serve the University
as professor of bibliographyâ€”teach
ing, soliciting gifts, and building the
Memorial Library of Music.
Dr. van Patten was given a Fest
schrift containing 30 papers, which
was compiled 'by Frederick Brasch,
consultant in bibliography; Jean
nette M. Hitchcock, chief of the Di
vision of Special Collections; and
Louise Maier, who was Dr. van Pat
ten's secretary throughout most of
his career at Stanford.
A number of the papers are per
sonal appreciations. Others are
scholarly contributions to bibliogra
phy and librarianship.
