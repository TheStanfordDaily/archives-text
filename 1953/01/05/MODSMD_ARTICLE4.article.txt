# Stepped-Up Draft Calls Predicted
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (UP)—A
Defense Department spokesman pre
dicted today that about 50.000 youths
will continue to be drafted monthly
for the next four or five months at
least.
He said the stepped-up draft calls
are the result of the tight military
manpower situation which is ex
pected to get worse in the coming
months. •
The spokesman said men are being
drafted now to replace those who
have completed their two-year tours
of duty and are eligible for release.
Some 80,000 youths were drafted
monthly in January, February and
March, 1951, and now are eligible for
discharge.
The Army also now is releasing
Korean veterans after 20 "months of
service instead of the full 24. But it
has tightened up its Korean rotation
policy, keeping men who served be
hind the lines for an extra month of
duty.
Defense Secretai'y Robert A. Lovett
said in his recent semi-annual re
port draft calls will continue high as
long as rotation is continued. If rota
tion is dropped, he said, it would mean
that some young men would bear the
brunt of the fighting while others es
caped military duty.
Warning that the replacement
problem will become "increasingly
serious," Lovett said the draft-age
pool of men between ISV2 and 26 was
reduced to 900.000 by June 30, 1952,
and is expected to fall to about 590,-
000 by June 30, 1953.
This means that some 19-year-olds
probably will have to be drafted in
some states in February.
The spokesman for the department
said any stepped-up Korean offen
sive probably would not be reflected
immediately in draft calls. But if it
continued over a long period, he said,
draft calls eventually would have to
be increased substantially.
The alternative, he said, wcfuld be
to obtain more troops by stripping
forces now in the United States as was
done when the Korean war started
June 25, 1950.
The spokesman added that the
draft calls and a tightened rotation
policy for U.S. troops in Korea do not
necessarily herald a new United Na
tions offensive against the Chinese
Communists.
