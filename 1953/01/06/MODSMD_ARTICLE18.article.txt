WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 (UP) —The House Un-American Activities Committee liar; launched
investigation of "subversives" in colleges and may extend the inquiry to cover as many a:. Al>
major schools, it was announced today.
Incoming committee chairman Harold H. Velde (R„ 111.) said one of the committee's 12 inves
tigators already is "spending all his time checking on educational institutions in the East."
He said "perhaps 25 major colleges and universities which we definitely know have, or have

had, subversive activities" will be
checked.
"In my opinion, infiltration of
Communists into education is one
of the most important weapons
that Stalin has for overthrowing;
our form of government," Veldc
told a reporter.
"The youth of today will be the
political leaders of tomorrow. It i.>
very vital that we educate them iti
the true spirit of Americanism."
Velde said that although the in
quiry in the East, a W«- ,t
Coast investigator who concen
trated on Communism in Holly
wood last year will now spend
part of liis time looking into edu
cation and labor.
Among the schools likely to he
checked first, he said, are Ha> -
vard, the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, Johns Hopkins
University, and the University of
Chicago.
Me said committee hearings dur
ing the past several years have
heard references to "subversive" ar
tivities at schools in New England,
New York, New Jersey, Tennessee,
and the Far West, and in Philadel
phia, Pittsburgh, and Chicago.
Teachers at some schools in these
areas, he added, were "identified a:,
subversives" by committee witm ;es.
He said the investigation will be
conducted "without fear or favoi to
any particular school or any loca
tions."
Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy CI? ,
Wis.), who will head the Senate
Government Operations Committee,
has said his group will investigate
Communism in colleges if the Hou -e
committee doesn't take up (he has I .
But Velde said he expects McCai •
thy's group to concentrate on gov
ernment investigations because that
is its major duty. He said "com
plete co-operation" will exu.t. be
tween the two committees.
McCarthy said his committee ha;;
collected a "vast amount of infoi ■
mation about Communist prole
sors" and will throw its files open
to the House Un-American Activi
ties Committee if it goes through
with its announced intention of in
vestigat.ing alleged Communism in
colleges.
