# Don't Blame the Schools

Senator McCarthy is at it again.
Last week U.S. News and World Report an
nounced that the Republican senator from Wis
consin had declared his intention to investigate
"subversive influences" in the nation's col
leges.
McCarthy was prepared to be philosophical
about any opposition he might encounter, it
r;o< ined, loi he told the magazine he expected
a lot of "screaming of interference with aca
demic freedom."
"Communist thinkers" was the term he used
for iho.se he sought to ferret out. He said he
preferred this term to the bald word "Com
munists."
Communist thinkers. We don't like to think
what this can include. Plainly it goes beyond
pufty members committed to the violent over
tlirow of the government. Couldn't it easily en
compass anyone who#favors the economic in
terpretation of history . . . anyone who re
gards with concern the difference of interest
between labor and management . . . anyone
in short who dares to intimate there might be
some point to anything but the ephemeral in
dividualistic free enterprise system.
Lnr.t week, too, Arthur E. Bestor Jr., professor
of history at the University of Illinois, was ap
pended by the nation's press when he declared

we were not getting our money's worth from
the more than six billion dollars we spend
yearly on education . . . because U.S. schools
exalt facts above thought, turn out graduates
equipped only with "saleable skills," neglect
to teach their students to think and understand.
This criticism was leveled .toward the
schools. We feel rather that the nation's school
systems deserve praise for teaching ideas to
the extent they do in the face of constant public
pressures against any instructor who attempts
to inject any sort of liberal idea into a class
room.
We believed this criticism should be leveled
where the blame lies ... on the McCarthys
big and little who are waging a constant fear
campaign against the nation's educators. And
by this we don't mean just one senator's com
mittee . . . but the school board that dismisses
a teacher who shows his students the other side
of the economic coin . . . the PTA's that at
tempt to censor school libraries . . . the par
ents who threaten to withdraw their children
from a university when they learn a professor
has told his classes Franklin Roosevelt was not
a fire-breathing monster with two green horns
. . . and the alumni who remove a school from
their wills when they learn some of its faculty
have political ideas different from their own.
Let's place the blame where it belongs.
