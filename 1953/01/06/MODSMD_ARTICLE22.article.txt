# BULL SESSION
## 
### SAM FRESHMAN 
It's open season on freshmen and with the first
ofli ril event of the 1953 rushing period being the
' 'lanford Club's Open House tomorrow night the hunt
in;■ will now begin in earnest.
A question which often enters the prospective
riiNlioe's mind when he receives an invitation to a

club or fraternity dinner is, how
liould I act? As usual, the pri
mary rule here at Stanford is BE
CASUAL ;it all costs.
If the only way you feel com
fortable is in white tie and tails,
then by all means wear formal
attire. If you don't like clothes,
come in your birthday suit. Don't
let the actives in their slacks and
: port coats fool you. They will
■ ecretly admire you for your

devil-may-care attitude and may even recommend
your pledging the house across the street.
Another important rule is TO BE HONEST AND
BE YOURSELF. If you think the rushing chairman
i' a schmoe, tell him so; he'll have a great respect
for you and will be sure to remember your name at
pledge time.
Try and ACT ATHLETIC. Show up at dances in
a sweaty sweatshirt. Run around the block a few
- dinner and wear tennis shoes at all times.
Thi never fails to impress, and when you enter a
room people are sure to sit up and take notice.
The now fad is TO HATE WOMEN. Girls have

become passe. If you are invited to a date dance,
say that you have sworn off women and prefer a
good hook or a game of bridge. This shows the
actives you are in the know and appreciate the finer
things in life.
PRETEND TO BE A WHEEL and play the name
dropping game. This consists of memorizing a. list of
names including the officers of the ASSU, The DAILY,
AXE SOCIETY, and CARDINALS and working them
into any conversations you might .have with the l ush
ing chairmap. This will show the -chairman you have
important friends even if you dortvt have personality.
Avoid PEOPLE YOU KNOW. These are often
your worst enemies, for they probably also know
you. If anyone asks you if you have any glaring
personality defects they will tell them. If you re
main in the background while they are around they
may even forget they know you.
Every Stanford student has three choices as to how
he wants to live—he can be a club, man, a fraternity
man, or an independent. Some of the better clubs
and houses choose a large number of initiates after the
formal rushing season.
The important thing to remember is to ignore this
and TAKE THE FIRST OFFER TO COME ALONG.
Remember that although the El Snorfo Club or the
Sigma Phi Nothings may not be the best club or house
on campus they are basically a swell bunch of guys
and somebody must like them even if you don't . . .
and, after all, you only have to live with them for
four years.
