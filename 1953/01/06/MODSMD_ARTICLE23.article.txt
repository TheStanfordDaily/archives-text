## From Another Viewpoint 
### JAMES S. TRIOLO 
("James S. Triolo '35, Assistant General Secretary,
authored the following article for the"From the
Inner Quad" section of the December, 1952, "Stan
ford Review." We felt that it said something impor
tant to students as well as alumni, so for the benefit
of those of you who missed it in the Review, we are
reprinting it here.)
My dad didn't want me to go to Stanford.
"That's a rich man's school," he'd say. And any
further conversation about my ever going to Stanford
would slow down, thin out, and evaporate.
! fe probably suspected, and rightly so. that my deci
sion was strongly influenced by the superior water

.port facilities and coaching on
Ihr Farm. My heart was set on
attending Stanford, however,
and I borrowed $100, scraped
together what savings I had,
and enrolled.,
(I didn't take me long to
find out that Stanford was
anything hut a rich man's
school. Sure, there were stu
dents from wealthy families.
! lived with some of them in
Rncina and attended classes
with more of them. Stanford
also gave them an opportun
ity to be on their own.

My dad had said I just wouldn't fit in at Stanford.
H>' was sure a V>oy from a modest income family
wouldn't have a chance. He was dead wrong. And so
are people who say the same thing today.
The University gave me every chance to earn my
way. I hashed, gardened, managed a residence hall,
and worked as a translator, lifeguard, and sponsor.
For a while I was campus representative for a San
Francisco hotel. I operated a hat-check service at
campus fiances. In the summer I drove a truck.
There were times, of course, when I still fell short
of meeting all my expenses. Stanford helped me
(long. I was permitted to sign tuition notes which
made il possible to defer paying my tuition until
alter I had graduated. Without them I'm afraid I
Would have had to throw in the sponge. At the time

I had no idea of the source of that money. I was
deeply grateful for the assistance, hut didn't think
about who provided it.
Several times I supplemented my meager wardrobe
from the closet in Dean Culver's office. As long as I
was willing to work, the University was more than
willing to help me. I happen to know that this would
be just as true if I were trying to work my way through
Stanford today.
I left the Farm with two degrees, a ream of tuition
notes, wonderful memories, and a deep sense of
gratitude to Stanford. It was evident to me then that
the University was fulfilling Mrs. Stanford's wish
that it provide educational opportunities for all stu
dents regardless of their means. It was also evident
that my father's estimate of Stanford as an institu
tion for the wealthy (still shared by many) was a
mistaken one. My own experience taught me that.
It was years after I graduated that I learned the
source of much of the assistance I received at Stanford.
I learned that the help I received didn't just come from
the /'University"; it came from people- people who
had had the privilege of attending Stanford and were
willing to help others enjoy the same privilege. Their
gifts were helping to keep the University the way the
Founders wanted it.
Stanford is not richly endowed, except in its basic
idealism. In terms of money, its endowment fund
earns only enough income to pay one-fifth of its
annual operating costs. Stanford has no special
shelter from external' threats. Depression, war, and
inflation have hacked at the roots of its financial
security. Yet it is as stoutlv independent and as
determined to live and serve humanity as ever.
Thousands of students have accepted the opportunity
to earn the right to become Stanford men and women.
Many of them have taken for granted the "assists" that
came their way. I did. but I don't any longer.
Someone who shares Stanford with us provided
the loan funds that were granted to me. Someone
who shares Stanford with us provided the scholar
ships, fellowships, and other forms of personal as
sistance. This flow of encouragement from one gen
eration to the next is the very essence of Stanford.
Our University was a gift to us from its Founders.
It is a gift we must help to perpetuate in our lifetime
and pass on to succeeding generations.
