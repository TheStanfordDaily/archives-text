# A 						HEART-WARMING STORY
## Students Aided by Village 'Blood Fund' 
### MARY MASSEY Daily Associate Editor 
Five days before Christmas
1950, a baby was born to a stu
dent family in the Village, and
the Stanford Family added a new
member organization at the
same time.
But no one Toresaw anything
out of the ordinary about an
other baby among the Village's
more than 400 babies and chil
dren. In this case, it was the
family's third child, and they
were financing it with their sav
ings of $300, supplemented with
the father's salary from night
work at the Veterans' Hospital.
Every cost was accounted for—■
IF nfething went wrong.
The baby arrived normal and
healthy, but its mother devel
oped internal complications, re
quiring a specialist from San
Francisco for surgery. While the

mother was kept alivq by whole
blood transfusions, doctor and
hospital expenses mounted.
It was a bleak phristmas Eve
for the family, but Christmas
morning, the distraught lather
saw the Stanford Family go into
action to take care of its own.
Two letters arrived special
delivery. One contained the
bill from the San Francisco
surgeon — marked paid. The
other was from the hospital
doctor — also marked paid.
Fourteen Village residents fol
lowed these miracles into the
apartment to announce that
they had each contributed a
pint of blood to replace some
of the blood used by the
stricken mother.
Added to Christmas
presents was the mother's
steady improvement. But she
was not able to leave the hos

pital for another two weeks—
running up a bill of $2,000.
To pull this family out arrd to
be ready for similar emergen
cies, Village students formulated
the plan which has since acted as
a blood "scholarship" for many
students. A fund was established
—supported solely by the pints
of blood donated by the Village
students. The funds derived from
these donations act as "scholar
ships," since they keep students
in school when such emergencies
drain away their finances.
But the fund is no longer re
stricted to Village residents—
as long as they're the depend
ents of Stanford students, the
fund is available for hospital
bills and blood replacements.
A mobile unit comes to the
Village twice a month, where Lee
Perry is in charge of appoint
ments.

To pull this family out arrd to
be ready for similar emergen
cies, Village students formulated
the plan which has since acted as
a blood "scholarship" for many
students. A fund was established
—supported solely by the pints
of blood donated by the Village
students. The funds derived from
these donations act as "scholar
ships," since they keep students
in school when such emergencies
drain away their finances.
But the fund is no longer re
stricted to Village residents—
as long as they're the depend
ents of Stanford students, the
fund is available for hospital
bills and blood replacements.
A mobile unit comes to the
Village twice a month, where Lee
Perry is in charge of appoint
ments.
Five days before Christmas
1950, a baby was born to a stu
dent family in the Village, and
the Stanford Family added a new
member organization at the
same time.
But no one Toresaw anything
out of the ordinary about an
other baby among the Village's
more than 400 babies and chil
dren. In this case, it was the
family's third child, and they
were financing it with their sav
ings of $300, supplemented with
the father's salary from night
work at the Veterans' Hospital.
Every cost was accounted for—■
IF nfething went wrong.
The baby arrived normal and
healthy, but its mother devel
oped internal complications, re
quiring a specialist from San
Francisco for surgery. While the

mother was kept alivq by whole
blood transfusions, doctor and
hospital expenses mounted.
It was a bleak phristmas Eve
for the family, but Christmas
morning, the distraught lather
saw the Stanford Family go into
action to take care of its own.
Two letters arrived special
delivery. One contained the
bill from the San Francisco
surgeon — marked paid. The
other was from the hospital
doctor — also marked paid.
Fourteen Village residents fol
lowed these miracles into the
apartment to announce that
they had each contributed a
pint of blood to replace some
of the blood used by the
stricken mother.
Added to Christmas
presents was the mother's
steady improvement. But she
was not able to leave the hos

pital for another two weeks—
running up a bill of $2,000.
