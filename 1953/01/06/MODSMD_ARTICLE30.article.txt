# Varsity Cagers Prepping For Bear Doubleheader
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity basketballers,*
still licking their wounds from two
trimmings by USC last weekend,
begin their drive to pull out of the
PCC cellar, this Friday and Saturday
when they meet the California Bears
in a pair of contests. The Cards pay
a call to the Men's Gym in Berkeley
Friday evening, and then Satur
day, the Cal quintet will return the
visit for a game at the Pavilion.
The Bears, tied for first with USC,
have now moved into the favorites
role for the Southern Division title,
having dumped pre-season choice
UCLA twice at Westwood last week
end. Nibs Price's quintet took the
Friday affair 72-68, and followed
that the next evening with a 68-00
double overtime triumph.
Coach Bob Burnett will be
spending* his practice sessions this
week trying to tighten up his de
fense, and boosting the scoring
(otitis of someone else besides lion
Tomsic.
The Indian quintet was riddled for
147 points in the USC tilts, while j
they could produce only 121. The I
Cards also had plenty of trouble on j
the boards as Ed Simpson and Dick j
Irvin pulled down numerous re- [
bounds.
Tomsic has been scoring at 20-
point per game clip, but the Oak
land sophomore is the only Indian
even averaging in double figures.
Ollie Suzdaleff, the second high
scorer has only an 8.9 per game
mark.
Whether Burnett uses the Don
DeLong, George Zaninovich, and
Russ Lawler forward combination,
or the Sam Morley, Wayne Culber
son and Don Carlson trio or any
other combination, they will all have
their hands full with the Bears' Bob

â™¦
McKeen. The 0-7 center leads the
Conference scoring parade with 44
points in two games.
