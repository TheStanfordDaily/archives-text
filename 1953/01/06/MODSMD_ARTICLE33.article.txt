# PUNTS AND PITCHES

### PETE GROTHE 
With due apologies to Joseph Henry Jackson, we turn book reviewers
today. The book, which is of more than passing interest to Stanfordites, is
entitled "Bob Mathias, Champion of Champions."
Jim Scytt, the hustling sports editor of the Beakeley Gazette, has turned
out a very readable piece of work on Stanfoixl's (and the world's) top
athlete, considering that he is the most red-hot Cal fan this side of Oskie

and that he didn't attend the two biggest
events in Mathias's life, the London and Hel
sinki Olympics.
Scott's compendium is worth the price of
admission ($2.95), if only for the reason that
he does a good job of describing the real
Mathias and because he relates many com
paratively unknown facts. For example:
(1) When Bob was a junior at Tulare High,
he shattered a Fresno Relays high school
record by muscling the discus 140 ft. GVz in.
A week later, teammate Sim Iness unleashed a
spectacular 150-ft. heave, unprecedented in
California prep annals. Then Mathias gave
notice of his amazing come-through ability by
stepping up and twirling the platter eight and
one-half inches farther than Iness.

(2) In his senior year of high school football, he gained 1,268 yards from 1
running and 350 yards in passing. He averaged eight yards a carry and
scored 14 touchdowns, five in one game, to make all-conference.
(3) As a prep busketballer, he made All-San Joaquin Valley center and
averaged 18 points a game.
(4) In high school track, he won 40 first places, broke 21 records, a per
formance never rivaled anywhere.
(5) Illustrating Mathias's unspoiled nature, Scott writes the following:
. . Getting ready to fly home for a brief rest before the (London) Olym
pics, Bob was unaware of the commotion he had caused (by winning the
national decathlon title at the age of 17). After the meet, Bob telephoned
home and, at the end of the conversation, when his mother asked him
whether there was anything she could do for him, he replied innocently,
'Yes, Mom, would you mind driving over to the airport to meet me. so I
won't have to take the bus home?' The unspoiled kid who had just made the
Olympic team in sensational fashion had not even assumed that his parents
would meet him, let alone that the townsfolk were planning a motorcade to
escort him the nine miles from Visalia airport to his home."
(6) Mathias won the most highly coveted of all sports awards, the Sulli
van award after the '48 Olympics.
However, we can't put this column to bed without suggesting that Mr. j
Scott be spanked red and sent to bed without his pahlum for his zeal in
fabricating items and distorting truth. The story of Bob Mathias is a great
story. It doesn't need embellishments. Further, some of Scott's anecdotes
are downright embarrassing to Bob, a guy who is easily embarrassed.
For example: "And the determination with V/hich the co-eds set their
pincurls and tacked up his picture on their walls indicated that he is the
prize catch among the sororities."
Stanford students will be interested to learn that sororities have been
resurrected on the Farm, that Guthrie isn't really Guthrie any more, but
Phi something-or-other.
We quote another Scott dandy. '"In the be-bop slang of the co-eds, he's !
"real George."
We have walked the length and breadth of the Stanford campus for
four years. We have guzzled coffee in the Cellar, minced about in the
reserved hook room, socied it up on the front lawn, sat through classes, and i
never, but never, have we ever heard anybody call anybody else at any
I time "real George."
It's a minor point, but ruffling to a collegian's dignity.
But ever onward. We quote on page 181: "Before the traditional con- ;
test (the Big Game), Bob again demonstrated that his stellar qualities were
not confined to the playing fields. At a bonfire rally, while the team was
j being introduced, an over-excited yell leader cried, 'And here's our world
famous guard. Bob Mathias!'
"A volley of mixed laughter and boos greeted the error, but Bob gallantly
stepped to the embarrassed yell leader's rescue. When the noise subsided,
he remarked, 'The way I'm hitting the line lately Coach Chuch Taylor has
j probably been thinking of moving me to guard and letting Norm Manoogian
carry the ball.' The good -natured laughter that followed meant that the
miscue had been forgiven."
Not only did Mathias never step to the yell leader's rescuc, but the yell
' king never said he was a guard. As a matter of fact, the team was not intro
duced at last year's rally.
The above are not exceptions. The book is full of fabricated anecdotes.
And as we say, the story of Mathias is such a great one that the truth doesn't
have to be stretched.
However, we must commend Scott for his easy, readable style, his
ability to catch the true Mathias personality, and his colorful setting down
of the big events of Bob's eventful life.
We just wish he would have stuck to the truth.

stepping up and twirling the platter eight and
one-half inches farther than Iness.

(2) In his senior year of high school football, he gained 1,268 yards from 1
running and 350 yards in passing. He averaged eight yards a carry and
scored 14 touchdowns, five in one game, to make all-conference.
(3) As a prep busketballer, he made All-San Joaquin Valley center and
averaged 18 points a game.
(4) In high school track, he won 40 first places, broke 21 records, a per
formance never rivaled anywhere.
(5) Illustrating Mathias's unspoiled nature, Scott writes the following:
. . Getting ready to fly home for a brief rest before the (London) Olym
pics, Bob was unaware of the commotion he had caused (by winning the
national decathlon title at the age of 17). After the meet, Bob telephoned
home and, at the end of the conversation, when his mother asked him
whether there was anything she could do for him, he replied innocently,
'Yes, Mom, would you mind driving over to the airport to meet me. so I
won't have to take the bus home?' The unspoiled kid who had just made the
Olympic team in sensational fashion had not even assumed that his parents
would meet him, let alone that the townsfolk were planning a motorcade to
escort him the nine miles from Visalia airport to his home."
(6) Mathias won the most highly coveted of all sports awards, the Sulli
van award after the '48 Olympics.
However, we can't put this column to bed without suggesting that Mr. j
Scott be spanked red and sent to bed without his pahlum for his zeal in
fabricating items and distorting truth. The story of Bob Mathias is a great
story. It doesn't need embellishments. Further, some of Scott's anecdotes
are downright embarrassing to Bob, a guy who is easily embarrassed.
For example: "And the determination with V/hich the co-eds set their
pincurls and tacked up his picture on their walls indicated that he is the
prize catch among the sororities."
Stanford students will be interested to learn that sororities have been
resurrected on the Farm, that Guthrie isn't really Guthrie any more, but
Phi something-or-other.
We quote another Scott dandy. '"In the be-bop slang of the co-eds, he's !
"real George."
We have walked the length and breadth of the Stanford campus for
four years. We have guzzled coffee in the Cellar, minced about in the
reserved hook room, socied it up on the front lawn, sat through classes, and i
never, but never, have we ever heard anybody call anybody else at any
I time "real George."
It's a minor point, but ruffling to a collegian's dignity.
But ever onward. We quote on page 181: "Before the traditional con- ;
test (the Big Game), Bob again demonstrated that his stellar qualities were
not confined to the playing fields. At a bonfire rally, while the team was
j being introduced, an over-excited yell leader cried, 'And here's our world
famous guard. Bob Mathias!'
"A volley of mixed laughter and boos greeted the error, but Bob gallantly
stepped to the embarrassed yell leader's rescue. When the noise subsided,
he remarked, 'The way I'm hitting the line lately Coach Chuch Taylor has
j probably been thinking of moving me to guard and letting Norm Manoogian
carry the ball.' The good -natured laughter that followed meant that the
miscue had been forgiven."
Not only did Mathias never step to the yell leader's rescuc, but the yell
' king never said he was a guard. As a matter of fact, the team was not intro
duced at last year's rally.
The above are not exceptions. The book is full of fabricated anecdotes.
And as we say, the story of Mathias is such a great one that the truth doesn't
have to be stretched.
However, we must commend Scott for his easy, readable style, his
ability to catch the true Mathias personality, and his colorful setting down
of the big events of Bob's eventful life.
We just wish he would have stuck to the truth.

With due apologies to Joseph Henry Jackson, we turn book reviewers
today. The book, which is of more than passing interest to Stanfordites, is
entitled "Bob Mathias, Champion of Champions."
Jim Scytt, the hustling sports editor of the Beakeley Gazette, has turned
out a very readable piece of work on Stanfoixl's (and the world's) top
athlete, considering that he is the most red-hot Cal fan this side of Oskie

and that he didn't attend the two biggest
events in Mathias's life, the London and Hel
sinki Olympics.
Scott's compendium is worth the price of
admission ($2.95), if only for the reason that
he does a good job of describing the real
Mathias and because he relates many com
paratively unknown facts. For example:
(1) When Bob was a junior at Tulare High,
he shattered a Fresno Relays high school
record by muscling the discus 140 ft. GVz in.
A week later, teammate Sim Iness unleashed a
spectacular 150-ft. heave, unprecedented in
California prep annals. Then Mathias gave
notice of his amazing come-through ability by
stepping up and twirling the platter eight and
one-half inches farther than Iness.

won't have to take the bus home?' The unspoiled kid who had just made the
Olympic team in sensational fashion had not even assumed that his parents
would meet him, let alone that the townsfolk were planning a motorcade to
escort him the nine miles from Visalia airport to his home."
(6) Mathias won the most highly coveted of all sports awards, the Sulli
van award after the '48 Olympics.
However, we can't put this column to bed without suggesting that Mr. j
Scott be spanked red and sent to bed without his pahlum for his zeal in
fabricating items and distorting truth. The story of Bob Mathias is a great
story. It doesn't need embellishments. Further, some of Scott's anecdotes
are downright embarrassing to Bob, a guy who is easily embarrassed.
For example: "And the determination with V/hich the co-eds set their
pincurls and tacked up his picture on their walls indicated that he is the
prize catch among the sororities."
Stanford students will be interested to learn that sororities have been
resurrected on the Farm, that Guthrie isn't really Guthrie any more, but
Phi something-or-other.
We quote another Scott dandy. '"In the be-bop slang of the co-eds, he's !
"real George."
We have walked the length and breadth of the Stanford campus for
four years. We have guzzled coffee in the Cellar, minced about in the
reserved hook room, socied it up on the front lawn, sat through classes, and i
never, but never, have we ever heard anybody call anybody else at any
I time "real George."
It's a minor point, but ruffling to a collegian's dignity.
But ever onward. We quote on page 181: "Before the traditional con- ;
test (the Big Game), Bob again demonstrated that his stellar qualities were
not confined to the playing fields. At a bonfire rally, while the team was
j being introduced, an over-excited yell leader cried, 'And here's our world
famous guard. Bob Mathias!'
"A volley of mixed laughter and boos greeted the error, but Bob gallantly
stepped to the embarrassed yell leader's rescue. When the noise subsided,
he remarked, 'The way I'm hitting the line lately Coach Chuch Taylor has
j probably been thinking of moving me to guard and letting Norm Manoogian
carry the ball.' The good -natured laughter that followed meant that the
miscue had been forgiven."
Not only did Mathias never step to the yell leader's rescuc, but the yell
' king never said he was a guard. As a matter of fact, the team was not intro
duced at last year's rally.
The above are not exceptions. The book is full of fabricated anecdotes.
And as we say, the story of Mathias is such a great one that the truth doesn't
have to be stretched.
However, we must commend Scott for his easy, readable style, his
ability to catch the true Mathias personality, and his colorful setting down
of the big events of Bob's eventful life.
We just wish he would have stuck to the truth.

With due apologies to Joseph Henry Jackson, we turn book reviewers
today. The book, which is of more than passing interest to Stanfordites, is
entitled "Bob Mathias, Champion of Champions."
Jim Scytt, the hustling sports editor of the Beakeley Gazette, has turned
out a very readable piece of work on Stanfoixl's (and the world's) top
athlete, considering that he is the most red-hot Cal fan this side of Oskie

and that he didn't attend the two biggest
events in Mathias's life, the London and Hel
sinki Olympics.
Scott's compendium is worth the price of
admission ($2.95), if only for the reason that
he does a good job of describing the real
Mathias and because he relates many com
paratively unknown facts. For example:
(1) When Bob was a junior at Tulare High,
he shattered a Fresno Relays high school
record by muscling the discus 140 ft. GVz in.
A week later, teammate Sim Iness unleashed a
spectacular 150-ft. heave, unprecedented in
California prep annals. Then Mathias gave
notice of his amazing come-through ability by
stepping up and twirling the platter eight and
one-half inches farther than Iness.

(2) In his senior year of high school football, he gained 1,268 yards from 1
running and 350 yards in passing. He averaged eight yards a carry and
scored 14 touchdowns, five in one game, to make all-conference.
(3) As a prep busketballer, he made All-San Joaquin Valley center and
averaged 18 points a game.
(4) In high school track, he won 40 first places, broke 21 records, a per
formance never rivaled anywhere.
(5) Illustrating Mathias's unspoiled nature, Scott writes the following:
. . Getting ready to fly home for a brief rest before the (London) Olym
pics, Bob was unaware of the commotion he had caused (by winning the
national decathlon title at the age of 17). After the meet, Bob telephoned
home and, at the end of the conversation, when his mother asked him
whether there was anything she could do for him, he replied innocently,
'Yes, Mom, would you mind driving over to the airport to meet me. so I
won't have to take the bus home?' The unspoiled kid who had just made the
Olympic team in sensational fashion had not even assumed that his parents
would meet him, let alone that the townsfolk were planning a motorcade to
