Simulated H - bombs are daily
blasting a model of a four-story
building into twisted wreckage at
Stanford University. But each time
the building is easily pushed upright
again, good as new.
The ingenious model is indestruc
tible, in fact. It is the product of
Professor Lydik S. Jacobsen, head of
the Stanford Mechanical Engineer
ing Department, and Dr. Robert S.
Ayre, who is now at Johns Hopkins
University . The project is supported
by giants from the Office of Naval
Research.
A little imagination is required
to recognize the model as a build
ing. It resembles nothing so much
as four metal rectangles placed
atop each other to a height of four
feet and surrounded by rings,
rods, and gauges. And of course
that's exactly what it is.
He and his associate were not try
ing for architectural realism, Dr.
Jacobsen hastens to add. Mechani
cal behavior of various buildings hit
by different intensities of bomb
blast was their objective, and they
achieved it.
The blast effect comes from nine
air - driven pistons, four on each
side and one on top. They are timed
electrically so that all four on the
side where the simulated bomb ex
plodes push against the model
building simultaneously.
A split-second later the top pis
ton presses down on the roof. Then,
one - two - three - four, from top to
bottom at additional split-second in
tervals, the pistons push against the
opposite side. This is exactly how a
bomb blast would exert pressure
against the building—on all sides in
quick succession.
How badly battered out of shape
the model is depends upon three
factors: the bla-.t intensity —
whether II - bomb, A - bomb, or
mere block-buster; nearness of
the building to the center of the

explosion; and the strength of the
building.
All these factors may 'be accu
rately reproduced. Air pressure
valves and timing devices regulate
the blast effect. Springs coupled
with circular friction brakes account
for the building's flexibility as well
as its final deformity.
The model is housed in Stanford's
Vibration Research Laboratory,
which Dr. Jacobsen directs.

whether II - bomb, A - bomb, or
mere block-buster; nearness of
the building to the center of the

explosion; and the strength of the
building.
All these factors may 'be accu
rately reproduced. Air pressure
valves and timing devices regulate
the blast effect. Springs coupled
with circular friction brakes account
for the building's flexibility as well
as its final deformity.
The model is housed in Stanford's
Vibration Research Laboratory,
which Dr. Jacobsen directs.
