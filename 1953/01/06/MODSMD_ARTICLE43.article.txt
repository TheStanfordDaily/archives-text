A Navy destroyer wallowing
through storm-swept seas on the
Stanford campus has developed the
answer to seamen's dreams and
landlubbers' prayers—an automatic
stabilizer to eliminate up to 90 per
cent of a ship's roll.
Strictly speaking, Stanford's
"destroyer" looks more like a
massive teeter-totter than a ship,
and the rampaging sea is repre
sented by a complicated maze of
giant springs, levers, and an elec
tric motor.
But in operation at the Stanford
Mechanical Engineering Labora
tory the apparatus can simulate,
on a one-fifth scale, a naval de
stroyer plowing through a Pacific
hurricane.
The device was discussed in a
paper given before a recent meeting
of the Northern California Section
of the Society of Naval Architects
and Marine Engineers in San Fran
cisco. Joseph H. Chadwick Jr. and
Albert J. Morris, Stanford research
associates, were the authors.
Aboard the laboratory ship is the
stabilizer, consisting of two par
tially filled tanks of water, one on
each side, connected across the bot
tom by a large pipe. Inside the pipe
are variable-pitch propeller pumps
regulated by an instrument called
an angular accelerometer.
As the motorized sea begins to
rock the ship, the acelerometer
turns on the pumps. Water is rap

idly transferred,to the tank on the
rising side. Its weight levels the
ship.
The experimental apparatus was
built several years ago by the Navy
and dubbed the "U.S.S. Minorsky"
after an acting Stanford professor
who designed it.
They now pronounce the sys
tem ready for testing on a real
ocean-going vessel. If it is suc
cessful, a ship's deck could be
come a nearly stable platform.
Aircraft landings on carriers and
accuracy of gunfire would be
greatly facilitated, not to men
tion the increase in passenger
comfort.
