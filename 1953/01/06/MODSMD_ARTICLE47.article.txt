The contention that dc-em||ha- '
sis of instruction in foreign lan
guages is robbing the nation of
one of its most important weap
ons in the cold war was advanced
by Dr. B. Q. Morgan of Stanford
last month at a meeting in Boston
of the Modern Language Associa
tion of AmericA.
"Unrecognized Disarmament" was
the topic of the Stanford professor
emeritus, who headed the Univer
sity's Department of Germanic Lan
guages until his retirement four
years ago.
The Modern Language Associa
tion, under a grant from the Rocke
feller Foundation, is conducting a
three-year campaign attempting to
promote more and better foreign
language instruction in American
public schools.
