## 
### United Press 
Heavy clouds covered most of North Korea early yesterday
but B-29 Superfort crews found holes to flatten important twin
supply bridges near Huichon.
The bridges, about 50 miles south of the Yalu River, were de
scribed by the Air Force as a "key link in the supply line from

H.he Kanggye gateway south of
Pyongyang and the battle sectors."
Twelve R-2f)'s struck the bridges,
which woj-e nearing complete repair
after strikes three weeks ago. Pi
lots said they believed supplies were
moving across them at the time of
the attack.
"Wc must have caught some
thing on one of the bridges," said
Airman 2/c Ernest S. Dumonf,
Lawrence, Kan., gunner. "Just as
we turned ofT our target I saw two
lilt's, large ami blight orange. A
sloe) bridge doesn't burn."
Crewmen said there was 110 anti
aircraft fire but one Red fighter
made a firing pass.
Airman 1/c Francis P. Gilhooley,
Brooklyn, N.Y., gunner, said, "The
fighter came within WOO yards of us,
' but 112 couldn't see much more than
the flash of his guns."
Other Allied bombers hit Red ar
tillery positions on the central front
and reported at least four big #uns
damaged.
A Hay beyond their threatened
I "D-day" for a major offensive,
j Communist ground troops still
made no attempt to carry it out.
Strongest effort was a 15 - man
probe north of the Punchbowl on
the eastern front. It was repulsed
quickly.
