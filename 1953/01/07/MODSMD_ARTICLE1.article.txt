## French Assembly Approves Premier 
### 
PARIS, Wednesday, Jan. 7
(UP) — Radical Socialist Rene
Mayer today won National As
sembly endorsement as Premier
of France after pledging his gov
ernment would seek modifica
tion of the European army
treaty.
The Assembly action ended a gov
ernment crisis which began two
weeks ago when Antoine Pinay re
signed as Premier.
The 57-year-old finance expert
won his bid to head Frances 18th
government since the war by an un
official vote count of 394 to 206. He
needed 314.
The vote indicated Mayer won
backing of political parties ranging
from the Popular' Republicans
(MRP) on the left to the Gaullists
on the right.
Mayer promised deputies of De
Gaulle's French People's Rally
(RPF) that he would not seek rati
fication of the six-nation European
army treaty until it is modified.
The new Premier mounted the
speaker's platform around 1 a.m. to
assure RPF Deputy Gen. Jacques
Chaban-Delmas he is not seeking
ratification "until additional proto
col has been added limiting the ex
tent to which French forces will be
integrated."
The Gaullists fear the present
army treaty plan would undercut
French sovereignty and create the
threat of reborn German military
might.
Mayer, an avowed supporter of
the European Defense Community
(EDC), apparently believed the
amendments could be achieved
without essential damage to the
treaty structure.
Mayer has announced that if ap
proved as Premier, he would go to
Washington to try to obtain addi
tional dollar aid and greater mate
rial assistance for the French forces
fighting in Indo-China.
