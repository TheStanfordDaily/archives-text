## Some Talk 
### 
LONDON. Jan. (i (UP)—Foreign
Secretary Anthony Eden said to
night ho could see no early end to
the Korean war and challenged the
sincerity of Soviet Premier Josef
Stalin's expressed desire to help end
the fighting there.
The usually soft-spoken Eden,
in a nationwide broadcast on for
eign affairs, made an unusually
bitter attack on Russia and her
satellites, calling them butchers.
He lashed the "sordid" treason
trials there and said he feared the
Communists may be opening new
Jewish pogroms like those of Adolf
Hitler.
His far-ranging report on foreign
affairs emphasized the Korean ques
tion.
"We have got to see this
through," he said. "Rut the sacri
fices are heavy, especially for th»
United States, and not one of lis
wants to sec the fighting continue
a moment longer than it must."
He said the plan for prisoner re
patriation presented to the United
Nations by India could have formed
the basis for a fair settlement. He
noted that 54 countries approved it
and only the five votes of the Soviet
bloc were cast against it.
'"Now bow docs all this square
with Mr. Stalin's declaration that
Russia is interested in ending <bc
war in Korea'? 1 ' Kd*>n asked. "If
Mr. Stalin bad really been inter
ested,, he had only to give a fair
field to the Indian proposals."
"In any event, 112 agree with Mr.
(Jawaharlal) Nehru (Prime Minis
ter of India) that it is good the In
dians made their proposal. It was
valuable, even if as a result of the
Soviet, 'refusal, which the Chinese
have now endorsed, we cannot for
the present see an early end to the
•fighting in Korea.
"And this also remains true. I
can assure you all that we will
go on working for an armistice on
terms that protect our prisoners
of war and the principles for
| which the United Nations stand."
