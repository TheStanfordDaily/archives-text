# Toyon to Add More Clubmen
## 
### 
Stanford eating clubs will have
200 men living in Toyon next fall,
announced the men's housing com
mittee. Toybn now houses 115 club
members. This decision will enable
additional undergraduate members
to live on campus.
At present. Toyon houses 134
freshmen, who < will be housed in
either Encina or the Village next
fall. The freshmen will again be
united, not split into groups as in
the last several years. Bus service
will probably be provided if the de
mand is great enough.
The 27 independents now living m
Toyon will have their ranks swelled
to 81 next fall, an increase of 300
per cent.
The housing committee feels the
action taken will benefit all con
cerned. They feel greater freshman
unity, living facilities for independ
ents on campus, and on - campus
housing for eating club men will be
gained.
