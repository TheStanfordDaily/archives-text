# Some Help for Korea
## 
### 
ITow many guys do you know in Korea?
Your former roommate . . . the fellow you
went all through high school with . . . maybe
even the guy who gave you the diamond
you're wearing, third finger left hand.
Ask you if you'd be willing to do something
to help any of the guys you know in Korea,
you'd probably answer yes. Well, there is
something you can do.
Planners are needed now for the spring quar
to blood drive. The drive will be the biggest
undertaking of its kind in Stanford history. It
will last a week and will include faculty and

staff for the first time. The quota for student
donations will also be set at a new high.
Ken Schechter, the chairman of the drive,
reasons that Stanford should be able to meet
a high quota of blood donations ... a group
of young people, generally in good physical
condition . . . and at an age when they should
be especially interested in helping out with
something like this.
If you're interested in helping plan the drive,
drop in at the Excom room at 4:30 this after
noon. It may be that you'll be helping a friend
in an indirect way.
