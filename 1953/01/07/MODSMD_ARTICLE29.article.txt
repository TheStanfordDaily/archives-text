# BULL SESSION
## 
### DICK MANSFIELD 
Over at the Daily Shack, they are getting things
ready. Two of the three bicycles which were parked
in the city room have been put out in the rain. Various
night editors are sending to Rerio for their green eye
shades. In the cluttered wire room, flunkies are prob
ing tor a missing wire editor.
The event is the Daily's Winter. Quarter training
program for would-be reporters and copyreaders, and

the Shack has got to look busi
nesslike. Ruby Bernstein, staff
editor, has been working on some
impromptu remarks to make at
the tryout meeting this afternoon
at 4:15. Although bookings have
not been confirmed, Dorothy
Dodge and Walt Menninger will
probably appear. With luck,
trainees will glimpse Larry Cahn
of the Sports department. Per
haps even Jack Byrne, head pho-

tographer.
But after all these greetings, then what? For the
trainees who will attend this afternoon's meeting as
well as the cynics who read only the Chappie, we give
you now a. Day at the Daily. Names are as fictitious
ar> possible.
The Daily slumbers until 3 p.m. At 3, Night Editor,
Head Copy Editor, and laborers gather at the desk to
reminisce. The Managing Editor has put up an as
signment sheet sometime during the morning. Assign
ment sheets look like this:
LIBRARY COMMITTEES
Schmurk—Get something big, art,
quotes. Page one.
At about 4, Alfred Schmurk, star reporter, totters

in, followed by a reporter. Schmurk has been over at
the library, digging up lead stories. The photographer
has taken four pictures. The desk workers leap into
action.
The copy must be read for corrections. When
Schmurk spells Dginlfzewski Dginltzewski, some
body has to change it. Names have to be correct in
inverse proportion to their length. If the name is
Smith, it is permissible to spell it Smtih. But Dginlf
zewski has got to go as is.
A headline must be written. For the library com
mittee story, the Night Editor assigns a headline which
counts 11 for two lines. This is when the laborers must
control themselves. Dginlfzewski has been elected
chairman of the Rare Egyptian Tomes Collection of
the K'rockmorte Memorial Division. Dginlfzewski
counts 11. We have a first line. Wags turn in such
things as
Dginlfzewski . or Dginlfzewski
Runs Amock; Axes Six Schmlnlfzewski
neither of which fit. Finally somebody says somethings
like "Libe Elects Dginlfzewski," and the copy goes to
the print shop.
it comes back in proof form, as it will appear in the
paper. Dginlfzewski is spelled Dgnizlzzetaoinshrdlu.
Linotype operators have a little contest among them
selves, and this linotype operator has just won 20
points. So a proofreader draws big circles around the
errors and out it goes to the shop again.
About midnight, long after the laborers have left,
the paper goes to press, the Night Editor is laid out
in a comfortable position under a table, and everyone
else goes home. The mystic process by which the paper
gets from the presses to the readers is a function of
the Business side, and John McCombs will be on hand
this afternoon to tell Biz side prospects about that.

things as
Dginlfzewski . or Dginlfzewski

neither of which fit. Finally somebody says somethings
like "Libe Elects Dginlfzewski," and the copy goes to
the print shop.
it comes back in proof form, as it will appear in the
paper. Dginlfzewski is spelled Dgnizlzzetaoinshrdlu.
Linotype operators have a little contest among them
selves, and this linotype operator has just won 20
points. So a proofreader draws big circles around the
errors and out it goes to the shop again.
About midnight, long after the laborers have left,
the paper goes to press, the Night Editor is laid out
in a comfortable position under a table, and everyone
else goes home. The mystic process by which the paper
gets from the presses to the readers is a function of
the Business side, and John McCombs will be on hand
this afternoon to tell Biz side prospects about that.

Over at the Daily Shack, they are getting things
ready. Two of the three bicycles which were parked
in the city room have been put out in the rain. Various
night editors are sending to Rerio for their green eye
shades. In the cluttered wire room, flunkies are prob
ing tor a missing wire editor.
The event is the Daily's Winter. Quarter training
program for would-be reporters and copyreaders, and

the Shack has got to look busi
nesslike. Ruby Bernstein, staff
editor, has been working on some
impromptu remarks to make at
the tryout meeting this afternoon
at 4:15. Although bookings have
not been confirmed, Dorothy
Dodge and Walt Menninger will
probably appear. With luck,
trainees will glimpse Larry Cahn
of the Sports department. Per
haps even Jack Byrne, head pho-

tographer.
But after all these greetings, then what? For the
trainees who will attend this afternoon's meeting as
well as the cynics who read only the Chappie, we give
you now a. Day at the Daily. Names are as fictitious
ar> possible.
The Daily slumbers until 3 p.m. At 3, Night Editor,
Head Copy Editor, and laborers gather at the desk to
reminisce. The Managing Editor has put up an as
signment sheet sometime during the morning. Assign
ment sheets look like this:
LIBRARY COMMITTEES
Schmurk—Get something big, art,
quotes. Page one.
At about 4, Alfred Schmurk, star reporter, totters

in, followed by a reporter. Schmurk has been over at
the library, digging up lead stories. The photographer
has taken four pictures. The desk workers leap into
action.
The copy must be read for corrections. When
Schmurk spells Dginlfzewski Dginltzewski, some
body has to change it. Names have to be correct in
inverse proportion to their length. If the name is
Smith, it is permissible to spell it Smtih. But Dginlf
zewski has got to go as is.
A headline must be written. For the library com
mittee story, the Night Editor assigns a headline which
counts 11 for two lines. This is when the laborers must
