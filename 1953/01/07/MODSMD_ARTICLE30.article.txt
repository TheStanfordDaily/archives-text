## 
### 
A freshman boy was suspended
for winter quarter and a coed was
acquitted in two Honor Code viola
l ion eases heard by the Council for
Student Control during finals week
of last quarter.
The freshman student pleaded
fuilty to the charge of looking on
another boy's paper during the
Western Civ final. As well as sus
pi nsion, he received an automatic F
in the course. The student from
whom he copied was also turned in
on the charge of intentionally giving

aid on a test, but was acquitted on
grounds of insufficient evidence.
The coed, brought before the
Council accused of copying parts of
a religion term paper verbatim from
a book, was turned in by the pro
fessor of the course who asked the
Council to exercise leniency in
reaching a decision.
Although the woman listed the
plagiarized books in the bibliogra
phy and gave some credit within the
paper, many copied portions were
completely unquoted and unattrib

uted. She maintained that . she
thought the credit she had given
was sufficient.
Finding that the offense arose
from ignorance of the fnechanics of
giving credit in a term paper, and
detecting no intent to deceive, the
Council ruled the offense did not
constitute an Honor Code violation,
and turned the case back over to the
professor, who gave the woman an
incomplete in the course and re
quired her to write the paper over
again.
