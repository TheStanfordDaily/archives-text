The meaning of "basket" in basketball has just about disappeared.
A basket scored today means little, and for one .to be spoken of as a
good shooter and high scorer he must continually bit in the teens game
after game.
And this tendency is only recent, within the last decade or even less.
We checked the record books and in the 1946-47 season, Stanford, in 24
games played, failed to get into the fifties at all and in the forties only five
times; in the season immediately following, Stanford got in the sixties once,
and eight times in the fifties in 28 games. We must take into account, though
it carries little weight, that the Indians were on the way back following a
wartime layoff and their scoring ability was not all it might have been.
Nevertheless we shall go back to the 1942 season to make our point. A brief
ten years ago Stanford came up with a club that won the NCAA champion
ship and was the nation's tops. In that season the cagers hit 60 points once,
and got in the fifties only eight times, and that was while they were winning
27 and losing 4. In contrast, last year's Stanford team averaged over 70
points per game and once broke 100.
And all this came to our attention when we considered the fine high
scoring that Ron Tomsic has been providing for the Indian cause. Many
say that the sophomore who shoots as though he owned both the ball and
the basket will shatter every existing mark for Stanford cagers, offensively
speaking, before he finishes his college career.
And yet Tomsic's fine seasonal average, which hovers around 20 points
per game, places him about thirty down in the list of high scorers across
the nation. In comparison, we turn back to that cage great of all time,
Stanford's Hank Luisetti.
Hank, who made the one-hand shot the shot that it is' today and broke
every scoring record there was when he played in the years through 1936
through '38, only averaged a speck over 17 points per game in his senior
season, yet was regarded as the top scorer and finest basketballer in the
nation. Today that 17-point average would place him somewhere behind
fifty other shooters in the nation. It shows you what ten years years can do.
A basket today is not monumental or even noteworthy unless it wins a
game or a player makes a ton of them.
There is little doubt that the major reasons for this increased scoring
are the numerous rule changes and advantages that have been made to
give the offensive game the decided edge.
Methods of play have also changed with a fast break for the large
part replacing the control type of play where each shot is carefully set
up. And we feel that defense has certainly been neglected; in fact, some
clubs and some members of some clubs use the time that they are on
* defense to "catch their breath" for when they take the offense. This lapse
often results in easy, not really earned baskets.
But, on the whole, we feel that the offensive splurge which has high
lighted recent basketball is a fine thing; it is certainly a crowd pleaser, and
though some of the ball handling may be a bit looser the fine variety of
shots which any team of average players provides makes a crowd forget
the deficiencies of such play.
We do believe it is bad that the day has come when a basketballer who
fails to at least hit the double numbers is completely forgotten by most fans,
though his value as a floorman, ball handler and team man is appreciated
by those closer to the game. When scanning the box score those who score
six or eight points, which would be all that was expected some years back,
are now almost scorned upon as being weak men.
This is the era of the offense. This is the era where the value of a
basket has declined tremendously.
