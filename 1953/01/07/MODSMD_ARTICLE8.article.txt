# 'Destiny of the West Lies In the Far East'—Gros
## 
### TED GIESE 
"I have more and more the
conviction of the startling para
dox that the destiny of the west
ern world may lie in the Far
East."
Voiced before a large, enthusiastic
audience in Memorial Auditorium at
last night's Tuesday Evening Scries
talk, this opinion keynoted discus
sion on "Dilemma in the Orient," by
Robert R. Gros, Palo Alto inter
viewer and commentator.
"We cannot shrug off an area of
such tremendous population, pos
sessing such a rich store of natural
resources like rubber and manga
nese," continued Mr. Gros. "Yet our
State Department has had a consist
ently inconsistent foreign policy with
respect to the Far East. Wo are
fighting there the same hot war we
are averting in Europe, and where
no hot war exists, every ingredient
is present for a prolonged conflict."
Mr. Gros noted during bis 35,-
000-mile tour of the Orient that in
most areas the people arc striving
to achieve self-government while
trying to combat the ravages of
war. Nationalism, he stated, which
in itself is a useful force, has been
perverted by "master propagan
dists in the Kremlin."
"We have sold China down the
river time and time again," said Mr.
Gros, deprecating the directive de
livered from tho United States by
George Marshall before Ihe National
ist government evacuated, advising a
coalition between Nationalist and
Communist forces.
Mr. Gros observed that the cur
rent "hot war" in Vict Nam is only
another facet of the conflict in Korea.
French leadership is being killed off
faster than it can lie trained in
France, and according to Mr. Gros,
the French caft hold out only until
Communist troops at the border de
cide to enter.
Mr. Gros described Korea itself,
which he visited for several days, as
a once productive land now devas
tated beyond description, both physi

cally and in terms of human life; and
• the Panmunjom truce talks as a
"circus and a farce, the state de
partment's symbol of disgrace and
appeasement."
Mr. Gros advocated for Korea
"more manpower and less lung
power," adding that thirty-nine UN
members have as yet not contributed
a single man to Korean allied troops.
"Yet don't get me wrong," he
continued. "There arc a few bright
spots, although very few, and each
is tempered by its own problems."
He mentioned Japan, a thrifty
industrious country in which rccent
elections demonstrated that democ
racy is on the march and Commu
nism on the way out. But, he warned,
although we are rearming Japan in
our own self-interest, we are run
ning the risk of over-arming her;
and her multiplying population'pre
sents an ever-increasing danger.
In (lie Philippines, he said, Hie
people are clearly aligned with the
West, and have made greaf prog
ress in combatting the links, but
(his rich country is at present
"crying and floundering for leader
ship."
Formosa, the last stronghold of
Nationalist China, is, according to
Mr. Gros, an island of dedicated
people with a greater preponderance
of trained leadership than exists in
any other Far Eastern country. And
it is an important tactical and stra
tegic position from which a great
part of the Far East can be overseen.
Referring to India, Mr. Gros noted
that while India proposes a solution
to the Korean war, she is herself
incubating a Kashmiri time-bomb
which could explode into "the most
vicious of all wars a fanatical reli
gious war."
"The Communists have tip to now
been winning the propaganda war
in the Far East," said Mi - . Gros, turn
ing to hopeful solutions for existing
problems.
"We cannot buy Ihe friendship of
the world. These people need tech
nical assistance, not dollars. They do
not need to be reworked in the
image of the United States."

"We cannot shrug off an area of
such tremendous population, pos
sessing such a rich store of natural
resources like rubber and manga
nese," continued Mr. Gros. "Yet our
State Department has had a consist
ently inconsistent foreign policy with
respect to the Far East. Wo are
fighting there the same hot war we
are averting in Europe, and where
no hot war exists, every ingredient
is present for a prolonged conflict."
Mr. Gros noted during bis 35,-
000-mile tour of the Orient that in
most areas the people arc striving
to achieve self-government while
trying to combat the ravages of
war. Nationalism, he stated, which
in itself is a useful force, has been
perverted by "master propagan
dists in the Kremlin."
"We have sold China down the
river time and time again," said Mr.
Gros, deprecating the directive de
livered from tho United States by
George Marshall before Ihe National
ist government evacuated, advising a
coalition between Nationalist and
Communist forces.
Mr. Gros observed that the cur
rent "hot war" in Vict Nam is only
another facet of the conflict in Korea.
French leadership is being killed off
faster than it can lie trained in
France, and according to Mr. Gros,
the French caft hold out only until
Communist troops at the border de
cide to enter.
Mr. Gros described Korea itself,
which he visited for several days, as
a once productive land now devas
tated beyond description, both physi

cally and in terms of human life; and
• the Panmunjom truce talks as a
"circus and a farce, the state de
partment's symbol of disgrace and
appeasement."
Mr. Gros advocated for Korea
"more manpower and less lung
power," adding that thirty-nine UN
members have as yet not contributed
a single man to Korean allied troops.
"Yet don't get me wrong," he
continued. "There arc a few bright
spots, although very few, and each
is tempered by its own problems."
He mentioned Japan, a thrifty
industrious country in which rccent
elections demonstrated that democ
racy is on the march and Commu
nism on the way out. But, he warned,
although we are rearming Japan in
our own self-interest, we are run
ning the risk of over-arming her;
and her multiplying population'pre
sents an ever-increasing danger.
In (lie Philippines, he said, Hie
people are clearly aligned with the
West, and have made greaf prog
ress in combatting the links, but
(his rich country is at present
"crying and floundering for leader
ship."
Formosa, the last stronghold of
Nationalist China, is, according to
Mr. Gros, an island of dedicated
people with a greater preponderance
of trained leadership than exists in
any other Far Eastern country. And
it is an important tactical and stra
tegic position from which a great
part of the Far East can be overseen.
Referring to India, Mr. Gros noted
that while India proposes a solution
to the Korean war, she is herself
incubating a Kashmiri time-bomb
which could explode into "the most
vicious of all wars a fanatical reli
gious war."
"The Communists have tip to now
been winning the propaganda war
in the Far East," said Mi - . Gros, turn
ing to hopeful solutions for existing
problems.
"We cannot buy Ihe friendship of
the world. These people need tech
nical assistance, not dollars. They do
not need to be reworked in the
image of the United States."
"I have more and more the
conviction of the startling para
dox that the destiny of the west
ern world may lie in the Far
East."
