V■ y/XI-j that was my
old school tie!
Once there was a basketball team that wji
the Hottest Thing in the Conference —until it«
high-scoring center, a Lump, of dubi
ous intellect, developed a bad attack of the
Flunks, and wound up Number I on the Inel
igible List. This with the team right up against
the Crucial Game, for the Conference Title.
The first half was Grim. Our boys limped
off to the dressing room trailing by 30 points.
The Coach had just embarked on a touching
Word Picture of him>elf, his wife and three
helpless dependents Starving in the Streets,
when in burst the Assistant Manager, trun
dling an overflowing wheelbarrow. In it wera
telegrams — hundreds of 'em —-from fraterni
ties and sororities, the head of the Student
Council, the Dean, the faculty, the ianitor,
from practically Every Student on Campus-—
all bearing the stirring exhortation "Win this
one for Old Blackstrap!"
Was the team Buoyed IJp? Oh buoy! Won
by 4 points, in overtime. They're now known
around the conference as the Western Union
Wonders.
Seriously, there's nothing like a Telegram
to put heart into the guy—or the team —that
gets it. Likewise, there's no nicer way to sa*
"Well Done!" In fact, for just about any
communique . . . whether it's a Hash tor
Cash to the Folks Back Home or Soft Words
to • Distant Damsel . . . it's belter to raak<
the pitch via Western Union.
