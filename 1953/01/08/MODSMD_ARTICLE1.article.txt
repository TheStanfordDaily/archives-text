## 
### 
Rating clubs will open their doors
again tonight from 7:30 to 9:30, as
they hold the sccond open house
of their '53 rushing program.
An estimated 600 men went
through the seven clubs last night-
Members of each club were on hand
to get acquainted with prospective
rushees and show them around the
year-old club building.

Following tonight's open house,
the clubs will host rushees at a
round of parties and invitational
meals during the next two weeks.
Meanwhile, Stanford's 24 fraterni
ties began planning their program of
open houses scheduled to begin on
Monday.
Houses along the Lower Row will
hold open house Monday night. The

Upper Row will play host Tuesday
with the Lower Row taking over
again Wednesday and the Upper
Row Thursday. On Friday all houses
will be open for inspection.
Members of the Inter-Fraternity
Council stressed again yesterday the
rules for rushing. They pointed out
that only men who have completed
one quarter or more at Stanford are
eligible.
They warned that the Council can
take action leading to debarment
from rushing activities against any
house that caters to ineligible stu
dents.
House and club presidents advised
that sports attire will be suitable
for rushing activities.
