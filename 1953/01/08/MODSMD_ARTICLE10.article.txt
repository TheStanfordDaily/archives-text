## 
### MARY MASSEY Daily Associate Editor 
"When a Korean veteran
without arms, whose life was
saved by 30 pints of blood,
comes over here from Oak
Knoll and is happy JUST to be
alive—people just have to give
blood."
These were the words of Ken
Schechter, chairman of the blood
drive, in describing his blood drive
appeal to Excom last, night. Excom
discussed the possibility of cutting
the drive's goal of 5,000 pints to
either .'5,000 or 2,. r )00 pints.
Schechter pointed out that if the
Red Cross can get a 00 per cent
turnout from military units and
prisons, they should get at least
5,000 pints from Stanford.

men could redeem themselves from
last year's panty raid by showing
their draft boards that college stu
dents participate in worthwhile ac
tivities, too.

drive goal at 5,(100 pints, with
Charlotte Trego dissenting.
Miss Trego suggested that Stan
ford make a statement upholding
academic and intellectual freedom

probes recently announced. How
ever, it was felt that no such state
ment could encompass all the opin
ions of Stanfordites and that it was
uncalled-for at the present time.
Excom also voted to allow the Ski
Club the use of Cubberley Audito
rium for a movie and speaker on
Feb. 4, providing the Ski Club as
sumes financial responsibility.
Don Lozabnick appeared on be
half of the Drives Committee to

ter's drive and its apportionment.

tween the Palo Alto Red Cross
and the World University Serv
ice. with 3 per cent going into the
ASSII floating fund.

awards for Herb Atkinson and Jim
Truher, frosh footballers. Atkinson
just missed playing the required
time, and Truher was injured.

presented Excom with a hook of
the history of Merlin Castle from
the University "in gratefulness
and friendship lor 1!)53."
