# Truman Says U.S. Could 'Ruin' Soviet With New Superbomb
## Republicans, Democrats Call Talk 'Dignified Presentation' 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 (UP)â€”Members of the Joint Congres
sional Atomic Energy Committee had high praise today for Presi
dent Truman's warning that the United States could wreck Rus
sian Premier Josef Stalin's regime and homeland with hydrogen
bombs.
Rep. W. Sterling Cole (R.. N.Y.). probable committee chairman

in the new Congress, summed up
the reaction when he said: "If the
threat that we may use our new
weapons can deter an aggressor
from starting trouble then the cost
will have been fully justified."
Republicans generally dropped
partisan politics momentarily and
joined Democrats in calling Mr.
Truman's valedictory State of the
Union message "a dignified presen
tation of his views." It was a warm
er reception than many of Mr. Tru
man's messages have received.
There were dissenters, however,
including Senate Republican Leader
Robert A. Taft of Ohio. Taft, long
one of Mr. Truman's bitterest foes,
said, "We can all agree on the basic
principle of opposition to Commu
nist Russia," but "the actual opera
tion of that policy has been so full
of errors, of wavering, of failure as
to leave the Eisenhower administra
tion with the most dangerous for
eign problem this country has ever
faced."
He said the President's address
was "more a message on the state
of the Soviet Union than an ap
praisal of the situation here at
home . .
Speaker Joseph W. Martin, Jr., oi j
'Massachusetts, said the President's I
report "was naturally an exposition |
of his administration."
