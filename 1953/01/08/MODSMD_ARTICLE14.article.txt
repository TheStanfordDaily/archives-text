### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 (UP) —A
powerful coalition of Republicans
and Southern Democrats today
crushed a bipartisan effort to force
through the Senate new rules aimed
at cracking down on filibusters. \
By a vote of 70 to 21, lite Senate
backed up Senate Republican Lead
er Robert A. Taft's proposal to table,
or lay aside indefinitely, the pro
posed change in the Senate's rules.
Present rules have prevailed, with
some modification, since post-Revo
lutionary days.
The GOP Senate leadership kept
solid ranks with Southern lawmak
ers to defeat, the rules proposal
sponsored by a group of so-called
liberal Democrats and a sprinkling
of Republican l ; Most of the group
hoped !o push Nnouch the tules
change as a . tep toward passage of
civil rights legislation.
The anti-filibuster bloc had con
tended the Senate is not a 'ontinu
ing" hody and therefore t. free to
adopt new rules each ession. Their
opponents contended the rules carry
over from session to session.
Some Republicans said they fa
vored tightening filibu: tei curbs but
preferred to do it with legislation
rather than a rules change.
Present rules require the approval
of fii Senator , a constitutional two
thirds, to cut. off Senate debate, a
requirement which many legislators
claim makes debate curtailment im
possible.
