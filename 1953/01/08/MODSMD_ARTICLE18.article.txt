### 
WASHINGTON, jan. 7 (UP)â€”President Truman gravely told
Russian Premier Josef Stalin today that the new hydrogen super
bomb has given the United States power to "ruin" the Soviet
! Union.
Rut, the Chief Executive warned in his farewell State of tho
Union message to Congress, the Russians would not be the only

I sufferers if the cold war should ex
| pand into an all-out, atomic con
! flict.
"War today between the Soviet
Empire and the free nations might
dig the grave not only of our Sta
linist opponent, but of our own so
ciety, our world as well as theirs,"
he said.
Mr. Truman's valedictory report,
a sweeping 11,000-word review <>t
his nearly eight years in the White
House, contained a sort of official
proclamation that the H-bomb era
with all its awesome possibilities
has arrived.
He made it grimly plain that (ho
state of. the union, and of the whole
world for that matter, is tied to
| atomic science which, he said, ha: 4
| already "outrun our expectations "
Whether this progress is turned
into peaceful or destructive chan
nels, Mr. Truman said, depends
mainly on Russia. And, he added,
"we cannot measure how deep-root
ed are the Kremlin's illusions about
us."
He said the recent H-bomb tests
at Eniwetok opened a "new era of
destructive power" in which pi an
! can "extinguish millions of lives at
one blow." Furthermore, he said,
"unforeseeable peaks of destruc
| tive power" are ahead.
lie made no legislative recom
mendations, saying he did not
want to "infringe" on the respon
sibility of President-elect Eisen
hower to "chart the forward
course" of the nation.
However, he listed in deVil what
he regarded as the "achievements"
of his administration and said:
". . . To desert the spirit, of our
basic policies . . . would surely
start the free world's slide toward
the darkness that the Communists
have prophesied."
He predicted there "inevitably"
will come a time "of change within
the Communist world" if the basic
foreign policies of his administration
are continued.
Among these policies, Mr. Tru
man named the Marshall Plan, the
North Atlantic Treaty, aid to Iran,
breaking the Berlin blockade,
other forms of foreign aid to Com
munist-threatened countries, and
the Point Four program,
In Korea, he said, the free world
under U.S. leadership met the "su
preme test" by demonstrating "the
will and the endurance to match the
Communist effort to overthrow in
ternational order through local ag-
I gression."
