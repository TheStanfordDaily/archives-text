ROCK SPRINGS, Wyo.. Jan. 7
(UP) —A plane chartered by the
Army to carry .'57 Korean veterans
toward their Southern states homes
vanished in the rugged country
along the borders of Utah, Idaho, and
Wyoming today.
The plane also carried a crew of
three, including a stewardess, and
possibly a fourth civilian.
A day-long aerial search was fruit
less, but faint hope was aroused to
night that some of the 40 or 41 per
sons aboard might have survived.
Flares were reported sighted on a
mountainside in the southeastern
Idaho country where most authori
ties believed the plane had crashed
or, by some quirk of fate, had made
a forced landing, and that any
survivors had not yet been able
to report.
If there are no survivors of the
C-46, it would raise to 269 the num
ber of lives lost in two months in
Alaska and the Western United
States through Air Force or Army
transport plane crashes.
