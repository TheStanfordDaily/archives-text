# Let's See the Trophies
## 
### 
Anybody seen a trophy recently?
Probably not, for the majority of Stanford's
fine collection of handsome athletic trophies
are quietly gathering dust in one of the rooms
of the men's gym.
But even this out-of-the-way spot is wanted
for offices by the Air ROTC. So let's kill two
birds with one stone: move out the trophies
and put them on display.
Either the lobby of Men Aud or the Nitery
in the Union provides ample space for setting
up trophy cases, and both of these buildings
are easily accessible to anyone interested in
viewing the trophies.
The Bowman Alumni House might also have
space to house them..
As for securing the necessary cases, the
senior class is presently selecting a class gift
to donate to the University. What gift, within
the means of the class, would be a more tan
gible expression of the class's appreciation to
Stanford?

Coincidentally, Joanne Hixson, chairman of
the senior class gift committee, also sits on the
Planning Committee for the new Student
Union. Since housing the trophies in the new
Union has already been suggested, perhaps
Miss Hixson could initiate plans to house the
trophies in Class of '53-donated cases at one of
suggested locations and then move them to the
new Union when constructed.
The Board of Athletic Control has actual
ownerships of these symbols of Stanford's
athletic achievement, but we have a report
that the board is approachable on the subject
of displaying them, if someone has a work
able plan.
We believe the foregoing plan is practicable
and urge that, for the benefit of the University,
the Class of '53 undertake to provide cases and
make arrangements for fitting display of the
trophies.â€”Jim Madison.
