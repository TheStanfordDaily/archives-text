# BULL SESSION

### BOB STETSON 
To have this column timely, I really should make
suggestive comments about the holidays, pass lightly
over rushing, and end up by ridiculing the Stanford
curve. But as I sit once again in the squalor of my
cubicle scratching my ankles on the splintered floors

1 choke up with nostalgia and shed
bitter tears.
Alas!
* * *
I #iust laboriously state, how
ever, that I had a really great
time during the holidays. The
only black spot was when a well
meaning friend came over to see
me at 11 a.m.
* * *
Before Christmas my heart was

warmed on several occasions when presents that were
obviously cartons of cigarets arrived for my parents.
They both had * quit smoking ten days before
Christmas.
For their benefit, I removed the temptation that
could cause a dreadful weakening in their characters.
Speaking of cigarets, I am reminded of the indi
vidual who was so nervous during exam week that
he chain-smoked all day long. His body reached such
a condition that he was throwing nicotine fits in his
sleep.

Finally, he figured out that the only way he could
get a good night's rest was to set his alarm each hour,
grope shakily for his pack of life-givers, light up and
suck feverishly for a few wonderful minutes, set his
alarm again, and slip back into a blissful doze.
Poor guy. He passed on during a four-hour exam.

Could it be there is a correlation between grades and
Rosotti's? I have found the following fairly accurate
among people I know:
A student —never.
B student—seldom.
C student —often.
D student —always.
There are two reasons for drinking: one is, when you
are thirsty, to cure it; the other, when you are not
thirsty, to prevent it. However, this quarter my red
eyes have observed many a degenerate swearing off.
"No more until the grades go up."
Some accept such statements rather sceptically
when issued by the D student. Actually, it isn't at all
hard to give up drinking completely. 1 know. I have
done it hundreds of times.
* * *
No civilized person ever goes to bed the same day
he gets up.

Speaking of cigarets, I am reminded of the indi
vidual who was so nervous during exam week that
he chain-smoked all day long. His body reached such
a condition that he was throwing nicotine fits in his
sleep.

Finally, he figured out that the only way he could
get a good night's rest was to set his alarm each hour,
grope shakily for his pack of life-givers, light up and
suck feverishly for a few wonderful minutes, set his
alarm again, and slip back into a blissful doze.
Poor guy. He passed on during a four-hour exam.

Could it be there is a correlation between grades and
Rosotti's? I have found the following fairly accurate
among people I know:
A student —never.
B student—seldom.
C student —often.
D student —always.
There are two reasons for drinking: one is, when you
are thirsty, to cure it; the other, when you are not
thirsty, to prevent it. However, this quarter my red
eyes have observed many a degenerate swearing off.
"No more until the grades go up."
Some accept such statements rather sceptically
when issued by the D student. Actually, it isn't at all
hard to give up drinking completely. 1 know. I have
done it hundreds of times.

No civilized person ever goes to bed the same day
he gets up.
