## What Chance Has a ... Dragon? 
### 
To the Editor:
Once again our valiant editor in shining, albeit
.somewhat dented, armor rides forth with her sword
of righteous indignation to slay the villainous dragon
McCarthy. And what chance has this poor straw
dragon against two-inch headlines and a bushel of
cliches?
Aw, c'mon, Dorothy; after all, this same house com
mittee (which doesn't, by the way. include Joe) did
find Hiss (do you think he is a red herring, Dot?),
Coplin, Pressman, White, etc. The FBI did turn up
I'.uehs, Greenglass, the Rosenbergs. Things may not be
nearly as black as McCarthy would have you believe
but they certainly aren't as white as Truman would
have you believe, either. And Dorothy, what did you
think of the democratic Justice Department fecalling
Vincent as a security risk (both noticeably after the
election)?

This house committee to which you so vigorously
object may turn up no results —and it may turn up
some. But don't you think they have the right and

duty of looking for people in our educational system
who would like to use force to establish their own pet
system of government in this country—and prohibit
people like you and I from disagreeing with one an
other?
I'll make you a deal, Dorothy. I'll match you Tru
man against McCarthy and call it even, leaving the
PTA, alumni with wills, and parents who didn't like
FDR out of this altogether.

(Editor's note: If Reader Hupp cares to re-read
Tuesday's editorial, lie will note that it dealt with
Senator McCarthy's intended investigations, not
those of Kep. Velde's Un-American Activities
Committee. Further checking will also reveal the
fact that The Daily has never criticized the FBI or
the Justice Department or any other group that has
uncovered persons committed to the violent over
throw of the government. We oppose the men like
McCarthy who hurl irresponsible and unverified
charges of "Communist" against everyone whose
ideas do not coincide with their own.)
