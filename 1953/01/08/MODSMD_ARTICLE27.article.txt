# Shaftels Develop New Child Education Method
## 
### 
Professor of Education Fannie R.
Shaftel, working with her husband,
author George Shaftel, has devel
oped a new elementary school teach
ing method by which school chil
dren are learning to meet their ev
eryday social problems by "acting
them out" in the classroom.
In the new method—called "socio
drama"—a problem story is read to
the class which describes a boy or
girl with whom the children in the
class can easily associate themselves.
It involves him- in various compli
cations similar to those faced by the
children in their daily life, and
builds to a climax in which the hero
must choose one way or another out
of his difficulty.
Here the story ends. The class
takes over.
The teacher appoints pupils to
represent the hero and his adver
saries or other characters, and

they act out a solution.
The rest of the class decides
whether the solution presented is
plausible or otherwise acceptable. If
their discussion shows the solution
is rejected, a new solution can be
acted out.
Role playing is said by the Shaf
tels to give the children a chance to
stand off and look at themselves
through another's eyes. And the
problem story deals with difficulties
familiar or meaningful to them.
Because children build fears,
anxieties, and anger in direct pro
portion to their social problems,
the Shaftels believe it is a vital
function of the schools to develop
in the children adequate ways of
meeting these problems. Children
are quick to apply generalizations
they draw from debate to their
own life situations, the Shaftels
report.
Dr. Shaftel is currently working
with Dr. Lester Beck, director of the
University of Southern California
Cinema Laboratory, in producing
films which will soon be introduced
as visual aids in the storytelling.
