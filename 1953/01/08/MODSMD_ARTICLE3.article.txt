## 
### LARRY CAHN Daily Sports Editor 
Commencing this Sunday, the Men's Gymnasium will be open
each Sunday afternoon from 12:30 to 4 for men's activities, Direc
tor of Athletics A 1 Masters announced yesterday.
The gym, which has always remained closed on Sundays, will
be opened as the result of many signatures to petitions in recent

months asking for the opportunity*
to use the facilities on Sunday af
ternoons, especially those during
winter quarter when outdoor ac
tivity is limited.
Open from 12:30 to 1
The gym will remain open as, long
as student interest warrants it. Mas
ters assured. And the new hours,
12:30 to 4, have been set up experi
mentally and if these do not prove
satisfactory they can be changed.
However, as it stands now there
will be no attendant on duty to issue
towels for showers or basketballs
for court play. Masters advises that
the thing to do is to secure the tow
els on Saturdays or early in the
week. Basketballs may also be ta
ken out on Saturdays for Sunday
use by the deposit of a student body
card as is presently required to bor
row a ball.
New Expenses
The added expense of opening the
gym on Sundays will not allow an
attendant at this time, Masters says.
In the past the gym has not been
open on Sundays because demand
has not, been great enough to offset
the added expense of heating and
lighting. But, as Masters has said, if
the demand remains the gym will be
kept open.
If intramural teams find the floor
too crowded for adequate play, it
may become possible to reserve a
court for an hour of play.
