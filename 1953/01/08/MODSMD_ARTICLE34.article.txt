## Farewell to Frankie 
### 
Although the football season is gone, we cannot let it pass without a
farewell salute to Frankie Albert, Stanford's two-time ail-American quar
terback who retired after seven years of play for the San Francisco 49ers.
Albert was the most colorful football player we ever saw. He did more
things-better than any other player in modern times with the possible
exception of Johnny Lujack.
For instance, when he played for St. Mary's Pre-Flight, he handled
the kickotf chores for the team, and in his Stanford days he hooted points
after touchdown.
He was an outstanding defensive back, too. Don't forget that when
the 1940 team went to the Rose Bowl the platoon system was not yet in
effect, and Albert led a defensive backfield which had only 40 passes com
pleted against them in nine games. We recall when Albert's St. Mary's
Pre-Flight held Fleet City's herd of ex-pro stars to a 13-13 tie. The crucial
play of the game came when Albert single-handedly brought down Fleet
City's atomic Buddy Young on the 5-yard line. He did the same thing
this year in the Detroit game when he brought down the league's leading
punt returner, Jack Christensen, in the open field to save a score.
Punting? Albert averaged 45 yards a kick for the 49ers. His memo
rable duals with great punters like Horace Gillom, Tom Landry, and
Glen Dohhs will never be forgotten. Gillom, Landry and Dobbs were all
huge men who could boom towering 60 and 70-yard punts on the fly. The

pint-sized Albert would outdistance them all by bouncing his punts away
from the safety man to take full advantage of the roll.
Blocking? Albert himself admitted this was a weak point, yet his boom
ing block on two Nebraskans sprang Pete Kmetovic loose on the punt
return that beat Nebraska in the Rose Bowl.
Running? Here was Albert's most underrated facet. His bootleg play
was an awesome sight to watch. Faking a hand-off to the three backs going
one way, he would run to the left and the opposition would find Albert all
alone with perhaps one defensive half-back between him and the goal. If
'the half-back charged, Albert would loft a pass over to Allyn Beals. Albert
averaged over seven yards per rush some years, despite the fact that he
lost many yards when he was nailed attempting to pass.
In a Cleveland game once, Albert bootlegged the ball 31 yards to the
4-yard line before the Brown safety man knocked him out of bounds.
Albert shook his band warmly and said, "Congratulations, you're the first
man who has figured out that play all year." Albert's cocky attitude was
another integral part of his play.
We have attempted to highlight these lessor-known abilities of Albert's
because his passing, play-calling, and field generalship are already legend
ary. When Albert retired. Coach Buck Shaw said. "It's been a pleasure
to work for Frankie these seven years." Albert was always the boss when
he was on the field.
In 1948, Albert had his greatest year. He passed to 29 touchdowns and
ran for nine more to account for 38 of the 49ers record touchdown total of 68.
But above and beyond all these talents was his ability to turn every
game, and even almost every plaf into something spectacular. We recall
the Los Angeles Rams game when Albert was apparently trapped by the
entire Ram line 30 yards behind the line. He got off a twisting run up the
middle, which found him bouncing off five tacklers, hurdling a sixth and
, staggering back to the line of scrimmage for one of the prettiest one-yard
runs in the history of football.
We recall his heroic efforts to defend himself from rough ballplayers
like Eddie Sprinkle and Rocko Pirro. who liked nothing better than to punch
Albert in the face. His 50-yard punts on the run, hectic fourth-down
gambles, his awkward-looking passes that always somehow found their
mark, all will be remembered. Football will never be the same without
Frankie.

because his passing, play-calling, and field generalship are already legend
ary. When Albert retired. Coach Buck Shaw said. "It's been a pleasure
to work for Frankie these seven years." Albert was always the boss when
he was on the field.
In 1948, Albert had his greatest year. He passed to 29 touchdowns and
ran for nine more to account for 38 of the 49ers record touchdown total of 68.
But above and beyond all these talents was his ability to turn every
game, and even almost every plaf into something spectacular. We recall
the Los Angeles Rams game when Albert was apparently trapped by the
entire Ram line 30 yards behind the line. He got off a twisting run up the
middle, which found him bouncing off five tacklers, hurdling a sixth and
, staggering back to the line of scrimmage for one of the prettiest one-yard
runs in the history of football.
We recall his heroic efforts to defend himself from rough ballplayers
like Eddie Sprinkle and Rocko Pirro. who liked nothing better than to punch
Albert in the face. His 50-yard punts on the run, hectic fourth-down
gambles, his awkward-looking passes that always somehow found their
mark, all will be remembered. Football will never be the same without
Frankie.

Stanford-Oregon State game. Albert and his Stanford team
mate, Norm Standlee, both retired last season after seven years
of play with the San Francisco 49ers.
Although the football season is gone, we cannot let it pass without a
farewell salute to Frankie Albert, Stanford's two-time ail-American quar
terback who retired after seven years of play for the San Francisco 49ers.
Albert was the most colorful football player we ever saw. He did more
things-better than any other player in modern times with the possible
exception of Johnny Lujack.
For instance, when he played for St. Mary's Pre-Flight, he handled
the kickotf chores for the team, and in his Stanford days he hooted points
after touchdown.
He was an outstanding defensive back, too. Don't forget that when
the 1940 team went to the Rose Bowl the platoon system was not yet in
effect, and Albert led a defensive backfield which had only 40 passes com
pleted against them in nine games. We recall when Albert's St. Mary's
Pre-Flight held Fleet City's herd of ex-pro stars to a 13-13 tie. The crucial
play of the game came when Albert single-handedly brought down Fleet
City's atomic Buddy Young on the 5-yard line. He did the same thing
this year in the Detroit game when he brought down the league's leading
punt returner, Jack Christensen, in the open field to save a score.
Punting? Albert averaged 45 yards a kick for the 49ers. His memo
rable duals with great punters like Horace Gillom, Tom Landry, and
Glen Dohhs will never be forgotten. Gillom, Landry and Dobbs were all
huge men who could boom towering 60 and 70-yard punts on the fly. The

pint-sized Albert would outdistance them all by bouncing his punts away
from the safety man to take full advantage of the roll.
Blocking? Albert himself admitted this was a weak point, yet his boom
ing block on two Nebraskans sprang Pete Kmetovic loose on the punt
return that beat Nebraska in the Rose Bowl.
Running? Here was Albert's most underrated facet. His bootleg play
was an awesome sight to watch. Faking a hand-off to the three backs going
one way, he would run to the left and the opposition would find Albert all
alone with perhaps one defensive half-back between him and the goal. If
'the half-back charged, Albert would loft a pass over to Allyn Beals. Albert
averaged over seven yards per rush some years, despite the fact that he
lost many yards when he was nailed attempting to pass.
In a Cleveland game once, Albert bootlegged the ball 31 yards to the
4-yard line before the Brown safety man knocked him out of bounds.
Albert shook his band warmly and said, "Congratulations, you're the first
man who has figured out that play all year." Albert's cocky attitude was
another integral part of his play.
We have attempted to highlight these lessor-known abilities of Albert's
