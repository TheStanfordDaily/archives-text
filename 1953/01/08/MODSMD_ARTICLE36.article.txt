# THE 						LOWDOWN
## Squaw, Badger Top Ski Spots 
### OLEY GROTHE 
Racks on the tops of cars, new
ski outfits, and autographed
casts prove that it's "hit the
slopes" time again.
For the benefit of newcom
ers to the Stanford campus and
to those who are going to learn
how to ski, we list the most
prominent ski areas near at
hand:
SQUAW VALLEY: This is be
yond the slightest hint of a shad
ow of n doubt the top ski area in
California. It has the longest
chair lift in the world and ex
cellent slopes for every type of
skit*. The men's dorm runs $2.50
a night, the femmes' four-bits
more. However, the food prices
rank with those in the Stovk Club
. and food with that at Marquard's
Drive-in.
Likeable Stan Tomlinson has suc
; ceeded the legendary Emile Allais
| as director of the ski school, but the
| French technique is still taught
there. In the French technique, you
only ski parallel. The ungraceful
I snowplow is taboo. Squaw Valley
1 has a top group of instructors,
j headed by Dode Post and French -
J man Joe Marillac.
BADGER PASS (YOSEMITE):
This has been one of the favorite
j, hangouts of Farm shuss-boomers,
but us popularity is decreasing as
Squaw Valley's stock increases.
Badger Pass has a "T-Bar," which
combines the principles of the
j rope tow and the chair lift and
has the advantages of neither.
Badger Pass has a nice run and
its ski school is one of the best.
Luggi Foeger, the director, is the
prettiest skier we've ever seen.
Anyone who has never seen the
grandeur of Yosmite's heroic scen
| ery should make at least one trip up
[ there.
DODGE RIDGE: This is good for
beginners and intermediates but is
as boring as an 11 o'clock Western
I Civ lecture for advanced skiers.
{ Dodge Ridge has a chair lift that
I goes to the peak of a run that is
[ less than half as long as Squaw Val
ley's. Its chief advantage is that it
takes less time to go to Dodge Ridge
than the other ski areas.
SODA SPRINGS - BEACON
HILL: Only fair. Although this
area has been improved in recent
years, there aren't too many
choices of runs. Also, it's as
crowded as' the reserved book
room in dead week.
Other places visited by Stanford
ites are Sugar Bowl and Mount
Rose. Mount Rose usually has ex
cellent skiing, but you have to go
all the way to Nevada to get to it.
The Sugar Bowl has a nice run and
an excellent ski school. However,
j no road leads in there yet, and you
j have to ski in or catch the tractor.
See ya on the slopes.
