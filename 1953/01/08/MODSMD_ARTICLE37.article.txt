# Card Wrestlers Open Hopeful Season Against Bears on 14th
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
Stanford's wrestling team, almost the same to the man as last year's rough outfit that tied a
highly touted Cal team in the Big Meet, returns to the wars against Cal on Jan. 14, and might just
be the Stanford team to go all the way this year.
Coach Don Williams has veterans in almost every position, and should be able to give any
one on the Coast a go for their money. Of considerable importance this year is the showing of

Steve Gee, scrappy little
ei\ Last year's team had to forfeit
this division in all their meets, and
lost more than one because of it.
Ollie ("the Little Tiger") Lyon,
at "128 pounds, should be able to
clean the league if his ailing shoul
der holds up. Lyon, a veteran
letterman, was out most of last
year with the ailment, but came
back in the Cal meet, wrestling
with practically one arm, to deci
sion Bill Hart, rugged lightweight.
At 137 pounds. George Russell,
last year's PCC champ, will be a
tough man to beat, as will veteran
letterman Bob Jessen at 147.
At 157, veteran letterman Ken
James should be closely pressed by
newcomer John Hanna, last year's
intramural champion. John Heald,
also at this weight, is a sensational
freshman, but is ineligible for varsity
competition this year.
Last year's freshman sensation,
Pat Madden, will grapple at I(>7
pounds, and should he one of the
top contenders for coast honors.
Adding depth to the position will
be Bob Beatie, a sophomore, win
ner of the AAU Novice champion
ship at San Jose last November.
At 177 pounds, "Smiling" Jack
Ogelsby, veteran letterman who
came in second in the PCC's last
year, will be another top choice to
cop league honors.
In the heavyweight division, letter
man wrestler and footballer Phil
Wilson, 5 it. 8 in. and 205 lbs., will

be another top contender for PCC
laurels. Breathing down his neck
will be his defensive counterpart,
Matt Armitage, weighing in at a
mere 200 pounds.
The team this year will wrestle
under collegiate rules instead of
Olympic rules as they did last
year. The Olympic rules will still
be in force in the AAU meets.
Under the Collegiate, a man must
be pinned for a count of three;
under the Olympic, only his shoul
der has to touch for a pin. This
results in accidental pins and men
pinning themselves.

The pointing goes three points for
a decision, five for a pin—the same
under both rules.
A combination Freshman-JV team
will have, besides Heald at 157, Bruce
Baily from last year's squad at 167
and A 1 Colten at 177. Baily is an
experienced veteran from last year's
squad who will have a chance at the
varsity if he cart gel away from his
law 'oks.
On Jan. 15, the wrestlers and box
ers will hold a double bill in the
Pavilion, with the matmen taking on
Oregon State College, while the box
ers battle Cal's bruising Bears.



TWO IMPORTANT COGS —Two men extremely vital to Stan
ford's wrestling fortunes are Ken James (left), veteran 157-
pounder from last year's team, and Don Williams, hard-working
grad student coach of the grapplers.
