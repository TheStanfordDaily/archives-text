# 'No Good' Seen in Red Probe
## 
### HADLEY ROFF Daily Political Editor 
Two oi Stanford's leading political scientists, when asked about
the possible results of the proposed Congressional investigation
ol subversion in the natfbn's colleges, said they believed such a
probe "would do no good" and might cause great harm.
The two, Dr. Philip W. Buck, head of the Political Science De-

partment, and Dr. Thomas S. Bar
clay, professor in the department,
described the intent oi' the investi
gation as "cheap headline hunting."
Congress's intent to investigate
"Communist thinkers" on college
campuses was announced Monday
by Rep. Harold 11. Velde (R., III.),
chairman of the House Un-Amer
ican Activities Committee. He told
reporters that his committee
would investigate possible sub
versive activity at 25 major col
leges, including several in the
West as yet un-named.
He said the committee would in
vestigate private colleges as well as
state institutions. A representative
of the committee is now working in
California checking on the college
situation.
Last week, Sen. Joseph R. Mc-
Carthy (R., Wis.), leading figure in
the Senate's Red-hunting activi
ties, said his committee, the Com
mittee on Government Operations,
was also contemplating a probe
of the schools.
Dr. Buck said results of an in
vestigation of the schools most
likely would be "inconclusive." He
pointed out there is no precise or
sure way to define subversive
thought. Thoughts, he said, are in
tangible, hard to pin down, and are
far too vague and nebulous to be
sharply characterized.
Such an inquiry, Buck warned,
could produce great harm because it
constitutes a "grave risk to academic
freedom."
He said he dislikes to see gov
ernment officials toy in academic
affairs.
Buck, a noted authority on com
parative government, said the sen
sation with which un-American in
vestigations are conducted leads to
twisting the Communist problem out
of proportion and promotes hys
teria.
Buck's charge was echoed by his
colleague, Dr. Barclay, a long-time
student of American political affairs.

Barclay branded the subversive
hunt a "publicity stunt."
He said he felt that such an in
quiry could accomplish "no good."
Both Buck and Barclay ex
pressed the fear that an investiga
tion of the schools would inhibit
teaching and curtail academic
freedom.
In Buck's mind the move to in
vestigate the schools represents a
loss of confidence in the American
institutions. He said this nation's
strongest defense against subver
sion is a strong confidence in our
selves and in our form of govern
ment . A probe, he said, represents
a tremor of fear and is an unhealthy
sign.
He declared it does America no
good when the government resorts
to the tactics "of a Mussolini, a Hit
ler, or a Stalin."
The most harmful possible re
sult of an investigation, particu
larly an irresponsible, witch
hunting kind, according to Buck,
would be the fostering of con
formity in teaching. The power of
the American educational system
stems from the variety of view
points expressed, he declared.
A reduction in the number of
viewpoints advanced in the class
rooms might lead, he px-edicted, to
placing the student in "cotton bat
ting" and closing him off from"the
hard facts of life." He feared that,
under the pressure of investigation,
teachers might be reluctant or
afraid to teach the whole truth
about social problems, leaving the
student with a false sense of social
values.
He claimed that American stu
dents should be made to face up
squarely to the problems of the day,
political, economic, and military.
But, he added, if a committee insists
on one brand of thought, then such
"calm intelligence" would be im
possible.
McCarthy and Velde, in a U.S.

News and World Report interview,
pooh-poohed the idea that their in
tended investigation would seriously
impair freedom of thought.
