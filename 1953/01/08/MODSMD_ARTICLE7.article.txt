### 
Students who arc interested in
working on the Stanford Daily but
who wore unable to be present at
the meeting yesterday may contact
Ruby Bernstein, staff editor, this
week.
Experience is not a prerequisite
for joining the staff. All lower and
upper Hi vision students are invited
to turn out for the training program.
The Daily will host an open house
next week. The exact date will be
announced soon.
