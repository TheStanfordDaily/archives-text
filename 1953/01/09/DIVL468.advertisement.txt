Smart Styling of '53 Chevrolets
11
Front-end styling of the completely re-designed Chevrolets accen
tuates the appearance of power and fleetness in the new line. As
shown above, the surface of the hood this year extends farther
forward before curving abruptly flfown to the radiator grille. Adding
its note of beauty and distinction, the outer rim of the grille en
circles the parking lamps and center bar mounting three decorative
"prop bars." Increased performance, comfort and convenience are
outstanding features of the 1953 Chevrolet line.
