## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
Coach Bob Burnett's varsity
cagers, sporting the role of the
underdog, will begin their drive
out of the PCC cellar tonight
when they meet the California
Bears at the men's gymnasium
in Bcikeley in the first of a
home-and-homc series.
Tomorrow evening the two quin
tets return to the Pavilion at Stan

DeLong will be at the forward
positions, Kuss L;nvler will op
crate at center, while Ron Tom

California's starting lineup will
probably be John Picksen and ei
ther Bob Albo or Rupe Ricksen at
forwards, BobMcKeen at center, and
Bob Matheny and Tom Greenlcaf
at guards.
The Hear quintet that is seek
ing its first four-game series win
since I!) 17-IX against the Indians
in this weekend's two battles is
probably one of the best Cal cage
teams to come along since the
If) 1<» squad which went to the
semi-finals of the NCAA.
Nibs Price's quintet already ha. L
displaced UCLA as the favorite to
cop the Southern Division crown
this season since they whipped the
Bruins twicc at Wcstwood last
week.
California's season record going
into tonight's game is only a so-so
six won and four lost, but the
Bears have lost only to top-flight
competition.
Cal breezed by its alumni 79-59,
CSC (itHawaii 77-40, and
< or X 7-:50, before they ran into
Washington with Bob lloubregs
and company. The Huskies took
them into camp (ill to 50, and fol
lowed up with a harum-scarum
0!l to XX overtime victory. Both
these games were at Seattle.
Wisconsin and lowa, both top con
tenders for the Big Ten champion*

ship and both possessing a home
-pourt advantage, were the other
squads to dump Cal. The Badgers
won (>4 to 57, while the Hawkeyes
took a <>9-60 decision.
Last week, still on the road, Cal
lopped UCLA 72 (o (iX, and (»X to
(><» in a double overtime. That
was the first time in over five
ycsTs that the Bears had ever
topped the Bruins twice in the
southland sweat box.


NUMBER FOUR IS BACK FOR MORE—Cal's Bob Matheny,
all-Conference and all-AAU guard, will start against the Indians
tonight at 8 in the Berkeley gym. Matheny suffered a touch of
polio in his shoulder at the close of his great sophomore year
in 1950 and has just this season received a doctor's O.K. to
return to college ball. The 23-year-old junior is 5 ft. 11 in.,
weighs 170, and hails from San Francisco.
