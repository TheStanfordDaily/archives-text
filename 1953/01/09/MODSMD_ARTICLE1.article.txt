# Scalpless Indian Cagers Invade Bear Lair Tonight
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
Coach Bob Burnett's varsity
cagers, sporting the role of the
underdog, will begin their drive
out of the PCC cellar tonight
when they meet the California
Bears at the men's gymnasium
in Bcikeley in the first of a
home-and-homc series.
Tomorrow evening the two quin
tets return to the Pavilion at Stan
ford Both contests will start at H.
The same Card five that showed
improvement in the second game of
the USC scries last weekend will
comprise tonight's starting lineup.
Burnett announced late yesterday.
(Jcorge Zaninnvich and Don
DeLong will be at the forward
positions, Kuss L;nvler will op
crate at center, while Ron Tom
sir and Oleg Su/.dalefT will be at
guards.
California's starting lineup will
probably be John Picksen and ei
ther Bob Albo or Rupe Ricksen at
forwards, BobMcKeen at center, and
Bob Matheny and Tom Greenlcaf
at guards.
The Hear quintet that is seek
ing its first four-game series win
since I!) 17-IX against the Indians
in this weekend's two battles is
probably one of the best Cal cage
teams to come along since the
If) 1<» squad which went to the
semi-finals of the NCAA.
Nibs Price's quintet already ha. L
displaced UCLA as the favorite to
cop the Southern Division crown
this season since they whipped the
Bruins twicc at Wcstwood last
week.
California's season record going
into tonight's game is only a so-so
six won and four lost, but the
Bears have lost only to top-flight
competition.
Cal breezed by its alumni 79-59,
CSC (itHawaii 77-40, and
< or X 7-:50, before they ran into
Washington with Bob lloubregs
and company. The Huskies took
them into camp (ill to 50, and fol
lowed up with a harum-scarum
0!l to XX overtime victory. Both
these games were at Seattle.
Wisconsin and lowa, both top con
tenders for the Big Ten champion*

ship and both possessing a home
-pourt advantage, were the other
squads to dump Cal. The Badgers
won (>4 to 57, while the Hawkeyes
took a <>9-60 decision.
Last week, still on the road, Cal
lopped UCLA 72 (o (iX, and (»X to
(><» in a double overtime. That
was the first time in over five
ycsTs that the Bears had ever
topped the Bruins twice in the
southland sweat box.


NUMBER FOUR IS BACK FOR MORE—Cal's Bob Matheny,
all-Conference and all-AAU guard, will start against the Indians
tonight at 8 in the Berkeley gym. Matheny suffered a touch of
polio in his shoulder at the close of his great sophomore year
in 1950 and has just this season received a doctor's O.K. to
return to college ball. The 23-year-old junior is 5 ft. 11 in.,
weighs 170, and hails from San Francisco.
Without doubt, the big gun on
this year's Cal team is Bob McKeen,
a G-ft. 7-in. sophomore. The big
pivot man, who will be the tallest
man on the floor in the two tilts,
is the conference's leading scorer
after two games. McKeen poured
in 44 points in the UCLA contests
for a 22.0 average.

Over the season, big Bob has
tallied 159 points for a 15.9 per
game ma'rk. This is the best rec
ord on the Cal squad. As a frosh
last year, McKeen was also the
high scorer for the Bears with 291 .
' points in 30 games.
:
Most of McKeen's points come on
his hook shot, but he is not just
a point-maker. He tops the Bear
team in rebounds with 88. Many
observers feel that by next year,
Bob will be a sure Ail-American.
Six-three John Ricksen, a sen
ior and possessor of the best field

goal shooting percentage for Cali
fornia. will f>e at one of the for
wards.
Completely recovered from a knee
injury suffered during the middle of
last season, John has a 47 per cent
mark from the floor. He is also the
second high scorer on the team with
117 points. His best shot is from
outside the keyhole, while he moves
around court with plenty of speed
and savvy.
Either Bob Albo or John Rick
sen's twin brother Rupe will be
the other forward. Albo, who has
scored 78 points this season,
is primarily a rebounder and a
top defensive man. Ricksen, the
other co-captain, has pumped in
75 markers this year, and also
concentrates on rebounding and
floor play. He is also a fine driver.
Bob Matheny, a 5-11 junior, and
Tom Greenleaf, also 5-11, but a sen
ior, are the BeaiV guards.
Matheny has been called the best
"little man" in basketball by some
observers, and off his performance
this year they may be right. Third
on the squad in scoring with 114
joints, Bob has compiled nearly an
80 per cent mark from the free
■throw line. A fine driver, uncanny
passer, and expert dribbler with a
sharp eye, Matheny was an All-
Conference guard as a soph in 1949-
50.
Forced to drop out of school be
cause of a touch of polio in the
shoulder, Bob couldn't get a doctor's
approval to play until this year.
Last season, however, he gained in
valuable experience as a guard on
the Oakland Atlas-Engineers' AAU
quintet, and was named to the All—
AAU team.
Greenleaf, though he has scored
only 44 points this year, is the

Bears' playmaker. A fine passer
and hall handler, Tom sat out last
year's conference schedule he
cause of scholastic difficulties.
Dick Tamberg, 6 ft. 4 in.; Jerry
Anderson, 6 ft. 4 in.; Ray Moser,
5 ft. 11 in.; and Larry Jones, 6 ft.
1 in., are the Bears' top reserves.
Tamberg is the top scorer of the
bench warmers with 44 points.
Burnett and Ins charges did not
appear awed yesterday at the
prospect of being on the same
floor with the league leaders.
"They're on the spot," Burnett
said; "they have to beat us. We
don't plan to beat ourselves.
"We plan to play a hard, aggres
sive game and now we'll really find
out if Cal has it."

BEAR DEADEYE—A full eight inches shorter than teammate
McKeen, Tom Greenleaf starts tonight at one of the guard
positions for California. A first-stringer last year until he was
declared ineligible midway in the season, Greenleaf presents
a constant offensive threat. Despite his accurate shooting,
though, he is known primarily as a play-maker.


CARDS BEWARE—Here's Bob McKeen, Bear sophomore center
who currently leads the PCC in scoring with 44 points. McKeen
has been rated a great prospect by observers and it is his accu
rate shooting that makes the Cal quintet highly favored over
the Indians tonight and tomorrow.

California's starting lineup will

forwards, BobMcKeen at center, and
Bob Matheny and Tom Greenlcaf
at guards.
The Hear quintet that is seek
ing its first four-game series win
since I!) 17-IX against the Indians
in this weekend's two battles is
probably one of the best Cal cage
teams to come along since the
If) 1<» squad which went to the
semi-finals of the NCAA.
Nibs Price's quintet already ha. L
displaced UCLA as the favorite to
cop the Southern Division crown
this season since they whipped the
Bruins twicc at Wcstwood last
week.
California's season record going
into tonight's game is only a so-so
six won and four lost, but the
Bears have lost only to top-flight
competition.
Cal breezed by its alumni 79-59,
CSC (itHawaii 77-40, and
< or X 7-:50, before they ran into
Washington with Bob lloubregs
and company. The Huskies took
them into camp (ill to 50, and fol
lowed up with a harum-scarum
0!l to XX overtime victory. Both
these games were at Seattle.
Wisconsin and lowa, both top con
tenders for the Big Ten champion*

ship and both possessing a home
-pourt advantage, were the other
squads to dump Cal. The Badgers
won (>4 to 57, while the Hawkeyes
took a <>9-60 decision.
Last week, still on the road, Cal
lopped UCLA 72 (o (iX, and (»X to
(><» in a double overtime. That
was the first time in over five
ycsTs that the Bears had ever
topped the Bruins twice in the
southland sweat box.


NUMBER FOUR IS BACK FOR MORE—Cal's Bob Matheny,
all-Conference and all-AAU guard, will start against the Indians
tonight at 8 in the Berkeley gym. Matheny suffered a touch of
polio in his shoulder at the close of his great sophomore year
in 1950 and has just this season received a doctor's O.K. to
return to college ball. The 23-year-old junior is 5 ft. 11 in.,
weighs 170, and hails from San Francisco.
Without doubt, the big gun on
this year's Cal team is Bob McKeen,
a G-ft. 7-in. sophomore. The big
pivot man, who will be the tallest
man on the floor in the two tilts,
is the conference's leading scorer
after two games. McKeen poured
in 44 points in the UCLA contests
for a 22.0 average.

Over the season, big Bob has
tallied 159 points for a 15.9 per
game ma'rk. This is the best rec
ord on the Cal squad. As a frosh
last year, McKeen was also the
high scorer for the Bears with 291 .
' points in 30 games.
:
Most of McKeen's points come on
his hook shot, but he is not just
a point-maker. He tops the Bear
team in rebounds with 88. Many
observers feel that by next year,
Bob will be a sure Ail-American.
Six-three John Ricksen, a sen
ior and possessor of the best field

goal shooting percentage for Cali
fornia. will f>e at one of the for
wards.
Completely recovered from a knee
injury suffered during the middle of
last season, John has a 47 per cent
mark from the floor. He is also the
second high scorer on the team with
117 points. His best shot is from
outside the keyhole, while he moves
around court with plenty of speed
and savvy.
Either Bob Albo or John Rick
sen's twin brother Rupe will be
the other forward. Albo, who has
scored 78 points this season,
is primarily a rebounder and a
top defensive man. Ricksen, the
other co-captain, has pumped in
75 markers this year, and also
concentrates on rebounding and
floor play. He is also a fine driver.
Bob Matheny, a 5-11 junior, and
Tom Greenleaf, also 5-11, but a sen
ior, are the BeaiV guards.
Matheny has been called the best
"little man" in basketball by some
observers, and off his performance
this year they may be right. Third
on the squad in scoring with 114
joints, Bob has compiled nearly an
80 per cent mark from the free
■throw line. A fine driver, uncanny
passer, and expert dribbler with a
sharp eye, Matheny was an All-
Conference guard as a soph in 1949-
50.
Forced to drop out of school be
cause of a touch of polio in the
shoulder, Bob couldn't get a doctor's
approval to play until this year.
Last season, however, he gained in
valuable experience as a guard on
the Oakland Atlas-Engineers' AAU
quintet, and was named to the All—
AAU team.
Greenleaf, though he has scored
only 44 points this year, is the

Bears' playmaker. A fine passer
and hall handler, Tom sat out last
year's conference schedule he
cause of scholastic difficulties.
Dick Tamberg, 6 ft. 4 in.; Jerry
Anderson, 6 ft. 4 in.; Ray Moser,
5 ft. 11 in.; and Larry Jones, 6 ft.
1 in., are the Bears' top reserves.
Tamberg is the top scorer of the
bench warmers with 44 points.
Burnett and Ins charges did not
appear awed yesterday at the
prospect of being on the same
floor with the league leaders.
"They're on the spot," Burnett
said; "they have to beat us. We
don't plan to beat ourselves.
"We plan to play a hard, aggres
sive game and now we'll really find
out if Cal has it."

semi-finals of the NCAA.
Nibs Price's quintet already ha. L
displaced UCLA as the favorite to
cop the Southern Division crown
this season since they whipped the
Bruins twicc at Wcstwood last
week.
California's season record going
into tonight's game is only a so-so
six won and four lost, but the
Bears have lost only to top-flight
competition.
Cal breezed by its alumni 79-59,
CSC (itHawaii 77-40, and
< or X 7-:50, before they ran into
Washington with Bob lloubregs
and company. The Huskies took
them into camp (ill to 50, and fol
lowed up with a harum-scarum
0!l to XX overtime victory. Both
these games were at Seattle.
Wisconsin and lowa, both top con
tenders for the Big Ten champion*

ship and both possessing a home
-pourt advantage, were the other
squads to dump Cal. The Badgers
won (>4 to 57, while the Hawkeyes
took a <>9-60 decision.
Last week, still on the road, Cal
lopped UCLA 72 (o (iX, and (»X to
(><» in a double overtime. That
was the first time in over five
ycsTs that the Bears had ever
topped the Bruins twice in the
southland sweat box.


NUMBER FOUR IS BACK FOR MORE—Cal's Bob Matheny,
all-Conference and all-AAU guard, will start against the Indians
tonight at 8 in the Berkeley gym. Matheny suffered a touch of
polio in his shoulder at the close of his great sophomore year
in 1950 and has just this season received a doctor's O.K. to
return to college ball. The 23-year-old junior is 5 ft. 11 in.,
weighs 170, and hails from San Francisco.
Without doubt, the big gun on
this year's Cal team is Bob McKeen,
a G-ft. 7-in. sophomore. The big
pivot man, who will be the tallest
man on the floor in the two tilts,
is the conference's leading scorer
after two games. McKeen poured
in 44 points in the UCLA contests
for a 22.0 average.

Over the season, big Bob has
tallied 159 points for a 15.9 per
game ma'rk. This is the best rec
ord on the Cal squad. As a frosh
last year, McKeen was also the
high scorer for the Bears with 291 .
' points in 30 games.
:
Most of McKeen's points come on
his hook shot, but he is not just
a point-maker. He tops the Bear
team in rebounds with 88. Many
observers feel that by next year,
Bob will be a sure Ail-American.
Six-three John Ricksen, a sen
ior and possessor of the best field

goal shooting percentage for Cali
fornia. will f>e at one of the for
wards.
Completely recovered from a knee
injury suffered during the middle of
last season, John has a 47 per cent
mark from the floor. He is also the
second high scorer on the team with
117 points. His best shot is from
outside the keyhole, while he moves
around court with plenty of speed
and savvy.
Either Bob Albo or John Rick
sen's twin brother Rupe will be
the other forward. Albo, who has
scored 78 points this season,
is primarily a rebounder and a
top defensive man. Ricksen, the
other co-captain, has pumped in
75 markers this year, and also
concentrates on rebounding and
floor play. He is also a fine driver.
Bob Matheny, a 5-11 junior, and
Tom Greenleaf, also 5-11, but a sen
ior, are the BeaiV guards.
Matheny has been called the best
"little man" in basketball by some
observers, and off his performance
this year they may be right. Third
on the squad in scoring with 114
joints, Bob has compiled nearly an
80 per cent mark from the free
■throw line. A fine driver, uncanny
passer, and expert dribbler with a
sharp eye, Matheny was an All-
Conference guard as a soph in 1949-
50.
Forced to drop out of school be
cause of a touch of polio in the
shoulder, Bob couldn't get a doctor's
approval to play until this year.
Last season, however, he gained in
valuable experience as a guard on
the Oakland Atlas-Engineers' AAU
quintet, and was named to the All—
AAU team.
Greenleaf, though he has scored
only 44 points this year, is the

Bears' playmaker. A fine passer
and hall handler, Tom sat out last
year's conference schedule he
cause of scholastic difficulties.
Dick Tamberg, 6 ft. 4 in.; Jerry
Anderson, 6 ft. 4 in.; Ray Moser,
5 ft. 11 in.; and Larry Jones, 6 ft.
1 in., are the Bears' top reserves.
Tamberg is the top scorer of the
bench warmers with 44 points.
Burnett and Ins charges did not
appear awed yesterday at the
prospect of being on the same
floor with the league leaders.
"They're on the spot," Burnett
said; "they have to beat us. We
don't plan to beat ourselves.
"We plan to play a hard, aggres
sive game and now we'll really find
out if Cal has it."

them into camp (ill to 50, and fol
lowed up with a harum-scarum
0!l to XX overtime victory. Both
these games were at Seattle.
Wisconsin and lowa, both top con
tenders for the Big Ten champion*

ship and both possessing a home
-pourt advantage, were the other
squads to dump Cal. The Badgers
won (>4 to 57, while the Hawkeyes
took a <>9-60 decision.
Last week, still on the road, Cal
lopped UCLA 72 (o (iX, and (»X to
(><» in a double overtime. That
was the first time in over five
ycsTs that the Bears had ever
topped the Bruins twice in the
southland sweat box.


NUMBER FOUR IS BACK FOR MORE—Cal's Bob Matheny,
all-Conference and all-AAU guard, will start against the Indians
tonight at 8 in the Berkeley gym. Matheny suffered a touch of
polio in his shoulder at the close of his great sophomore year
in 1950 and has just this season received a doctor's O.K. to
return to college ball. The 23-year-old junior is 5 ft. 11 in.,
weighs 170, and hails from San Francisco.
Without doubt, the big gun on
this year's Cal team is Bob McKeen,
a G-ft. 7-in. sophomore. The big
pivot man, who will be the tallest
man on the floor in the two tilts,
is the conference's leading scorer
after two games. McKeen poured
in 44 points in the UCLA contests
for a 22.0 average.

Over the season, big Bob has
tallied 159 points for a 15.9 per
game ma'rk. This is the best rec
ord on the Cal squad. As a frosh
last year, McKeen was also the
high scorer for the Bears with 291 .
' points in 30 games.
:
Most of McKeen's points come on
his hook shot, but he is not just
a point-maker. He tops the Bear
team in rebounds with 88. Many
observers feel that by next year,
Bob will be a sure Ail-American.
Six-three John Ricksen, a sen
ior and possessor of the best field

goal shooting percentage for Cali
fornia. will f>e at one of the for
wards.
Completely recovered from a knee
injury suffered during the middle of
last season, John has a 47 per cent
mark from the floor. He is also the
second high scorer on the team with
117 points. His best shot is from
outside the keyhole, while he moves
around court with plenty of speed
and savvy.
Either Bob Albo or John Rick
sen's twin brother Rupe will be
the other forward. Albo, who has
scored 78 points this season,
is primarily a rebounder and a
top defensive man. Ricksen, the
other co-captain, has pumped in
75 markers this year, and also
concentrates on rebounding and
floor play. He is also a fine driver.
Bob Matheny, a 5-11 junior, and
Tom Greenleaf, also 5-11, but a sen
ior, are the BeaiV guards.
Matheny has been called the best
"little man" in basketball by some
observers, and off his performance
this year they may be right. Third
on the squad in scoring with 114
joints, Bob has compiled nearly an
80 per cent mark from the free
■throw line. A fine driver, uncanny
passer, and expert dribbler with a
sharp eye, Matheny was an All-
Conference guard as a soph in 1949-
50.
Forced to drop out of school be
cause of a touch of polio in the
shoulder, Bob couldn't get a doctor's
approval to play until this year.
Last season, however, he gained in
valuable experience as a guard on
the Oakland Atlas-Engineers' AAU
quintet, and was named to the All—
AAU team.
Greenleaf, though he has scored
only 44 points this year, is the

Bears' playmaker. A fine passer
and hall handler, Tom sat out last
year's conference schedule he
cause of scholastic difficulties.
Dick Tamberg, 6 ft. 4 in.; Jerry
Anderson, 6 ft. 4 in.; Ray Moser,
5 ft. 11 in.; and Larry Jones, 6 ft.
1 in., are the Bears' top reserves.
Tamberg is the top scorer of the
bench warmers with 44 points.
Burnett and Ins charges did not
appear awed yesterday at the
prospect of being on the same
floor with the league leaders.
"They're on the spot," Burnett
said; "they have to beat us. We
don't plan to beat ourselves.
"We plan to play a hard, aggres
sive game and now we'll really find
out if Cal has it."
Tonight's lineups follow:

BEAR DEADEYE—A full eight inches shorter than teammate
McKeen, Tom Greenleaf starts tonight at one of the guard
positions for California. A first-stringer last year until he was
declared ineligible midway in the season, Greenleaf presents
a constant offensive threat. Despite his accurate shooting,
though, he is known primarily as a play-maker.


CARDS BEWARE—Here's Bob McKeen, Bear sophomore center
who currently leads the PCC in scoring with 44 points. McKeen
has been rated a great prospect by observers and it is his accu
rate shooting that makes the Cal quintet highly favored over
the Indians tonight and tomorrow.
