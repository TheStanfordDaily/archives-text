# Tumblers to Entertain 'Winter Whirl’ Dancers
## 
### 
The Stanford Aero-Troupe will be featured as entertainers at
the "Winter Whirl," the all-campus dance to be held tomorrow
night from D to 1 in the Women's Gym.
Tickots sell for SJ .98 per couple and may be purchased from
10 to 2 in front of the Cellar, and from 8 to 5 at the ASSU office,

and the Enema office.
Co-Rec is sponsoring the dance,
which will include square dancing in
the small gym, ping-pong contests,
and card games. Music will be sup
plied by the Rhythm Venders.
Dress for the dance will be casual,
since most students will come after
the Cal-Stanford basketball game.
The Aero-Troupe will present
three acts during the evening. A
balancing skit, "The Waiters," will
be given by Jerold Nesselrod and
James Melton. A tumbling exhibi
tion will be yiven by John Gil more,
John White, and Bob Swain.
In the final act of the show, Jack
Woodman and Ken Hirsch will be
featured in a special trampoline
tumbling art called "Something Dif
ferent on the Trampoline."
Hirsch and Woodman will pre
view their act when they appear in
a trampoline tumbling show at half
time of the Stanford-Cal basketball
game.
Also appearing at the same time
will be a group of Aero-Troupe per
formers headed by Steve Vargas,
former Eastern collegiate gymnastics
champion of the University of Penn
sylvania.


OUCH!—Acro-Troupe star Ken Hirsch looks worried as he is
about to land on the trampoline. Hirsch and other members of
Acro-Troupe will perform during half-time at the Cal-Stanford
basketball game tomorrow night. They will also present a tram
poline tumbling exhibition at the all-campus dance, "Winter
Whirl," which follows the game.
