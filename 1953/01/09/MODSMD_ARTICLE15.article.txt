TEHRAN, Jan. 8 (UP)-Premier
Mohammed 'Mossadegh today de
manded a year's extension of his
special dictatorial powers, touching
off stormy opposition in parliament
and other high quarters.
The demand threw the Majlis, or
lower house of parliament, into an
uproar. Two of Iran's most powerful
men, next to the aged and ailing
Mossadegh himself, turned violently
against him.
