BRRRR!—Charles McGriff, assistant technician at the Microwave Laboratory, fills a vacuum
sump with freezing-cold liquid nitrogen. The nitrogen, at a temperature of 320 degrees below
zero, is used to condense moisture in the linear accelerator "and produce an almost perfect
vacuum. See page four for more pictures and a story on Stanford's atom smasher.
