## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 (UP)—Defense Secretary Robert A.
Lovett called today for a "drastic" reorganization of the military
high command and proposed strict new laws to protect the nation
against "traitors, spies and blabber-mouths."
He warned that the present set-up of the defense department
and joint chiefs of staff is "inadequate" and in danger of bogging

down in time of war. Likewise, he
said, it is of "cardinal importance"
to nail shut the door on military
secrets before it is too late.
Lovett made his recommendations
in a letter to President Truman
which he previously made available
to Charles E. Wilson, his successor
in the Eisenhower administration.
He made it public as he appeared
before the House Armed Services
Committee to report on the world
situation.
In calling for widespread revi
sion of the 1947 Armed Forces
Unification Act and other laws
governing the military, Lovett
said that one of the "great haz
ards" to national security is the
"apparent inadequacy" of laws
against spies and traitors
The outgoing Defense Secretary
said his own authority had been left
in doubt at some points by the five
year-old unification act. and that
the joint chiefs had been hogtied
in their duties and buried under
paper work.
Lovett said the joint chiefs
cannot function properly as bosses
of the Army, Navy, and Air Force
and still serve as members of an
overall strategy and policy coun
cil. He recommended that staff
functions he transferred to their
deputies, leaving them free to map
strategy.
Lovett. aLso suggested that the
chairman of the chiefs, now Gen.
Omar N. Bradley, be given a "vote"
in their decisions. Since the chair
man is not attached to any single
service, he said, he is in the best
position of all to make judgments.
