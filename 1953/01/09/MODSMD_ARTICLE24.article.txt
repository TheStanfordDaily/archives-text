# Better Than a Reg Dance?
## 
### 
Students who have been plugging for more
on campus, all-campus social events will have
a chance to prove their interest tomorrow night
for the attendance at Co-Rec's "Winter
Whirl" will show if the campus is serious in
having more activities around the home plate.
The dance is not an actual reg dance. That
theme is being played down. Students who
have been around here a few guarters can
remember that last year winter and spring
quarter reg dances were discontinued. Why?
Because they lost money for the sponsors, and
the attendance was poor.
ASSU Vice-President Ellie Myers, Activities
Board, which approved the dance, and Co-Rec,
the sponsors, believe that tomorrow night's
dance will be an improvement over past
dances held reg week.

First, the Saturday date gives students a
dance which is not held on a week night. The
reg dance was usually held the night before
classes started.
In addition, because the dance is held after
the start of the quarter, more time is given
to get dates. *
Postponing the dance until the end of the
week also allows the "sponsors to make more
adequate plans and to arrange better enter
tainment and a more successful dance.
As most of us know, there are few opportu
nities for the whole campus to get together
at a dance. If the "Winter Whirl" turnout is
large and if the dance is enthusiastically re
ceived by the students, plans will be made to
continue winter and spring reg dances, â€”Huby
