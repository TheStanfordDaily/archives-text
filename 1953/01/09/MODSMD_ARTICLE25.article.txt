# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
I was sitting in the reserved book room yesterday,
studying my poly sci, and I got to thinking.
I find that the reserved book room is one of the best
places to think about things other than studies. I got
to thinking about one of my favorite subjects . . .

time, that fantastic force that does -
all its jobs so gradually and in
conspicuously.
I got to thinking about how a
tall, brown-haired undergrad with
n Stanford jacket and a crew cut
who just walked in the RBR would
in a few years be sitting in a stuffy
office iti a noisy city or climbing
one of those precipitous, ugly hills
in Korea. And about how maybe
he'd wish he was back on the

Farm.
About how the rains and winds since the Univer
sity's opening in 1891 have cut down the brown sand
stone of the Quad a few millionths of an inch.
About the same stones 011 the Quad that we walk
on every day once housed the undergraduate shoes
ol an engineering major who went on to become
President of the United States, of a trio of present
Hollywood residents named Lloyd Nolan, Jack Palanse
and Doodles Weaver, of playright Maxwell Anderson,
of an author called John Steinbeck, and of a fellow
named Luther Evans, who now is the Librarian of
Congress.
About how the classrooms of this University have
seated 77,457 students in 02 years, some of whom
have become hank presidents, and some of whom
have died paupers, some of whom have been foot

ball coaches, hank tellers, engineers, psychiatrists,
insurance salesmen, lawyers, janitors, teachers, bone
surgeons, newspaper writers, taxicah drivers, zoolo
gists, actors, presidents of sprawling companies, and
garbage collectors.
About the story the aged and ageless oak tree in
front of the main libe could tell if it could only talk.
About the approximate 1,240,000 man-hours of learn
ing that one of the rooms in the inner Quad has been
the scene of, and about how most of those hours have
been forgotten long ago.
About how, in principle, things are the same on the
Farm now as they were 50 years ago; the wearing
apparel is different and they have different fads now,
but the smoke goes up the chimneys just like it did
then, and we talk about classes, profs, dates, and ath
letics, just like they did then.
About how babies just now beginning to piece to
gether sentences will in several years be drinking
coffee at the Cellar, running for touchdowns at the
Stadium, and directing student activities from the
ASSU office.
About how we in school will return in the years to
come with gray hair, or no hair at all. and with our
faces wrinkled and our walk a little slower and our
posture a little more bent. And about hdVv it will
all look the same and yet so different. The buildings
will all be the same, but the faces will be so un
familiar. And about how the youngsters will look at
us like we look at the oldsters now and think, "Who
are they?"
And about how we'll do something that we scorn
now . . . long for "the good old days."
Then I kind of scolded myself for letting my
thoughts wander, and I returned to my poly sci.

us like we look at the oldsters now and think, "Who
are they?"
And about how we'll do something that we scorn
now . . . long for "the good old days."
Then I kind of scolded myself for letting my
thoughts wander, and I returned to my poly sci.

I was sitting in the reserved book room yesterday,
studying my poly sci, and I got to thinking.
I find that the reserved book room is one of the best
places to think about things other than studies. I got
to thinking about one of my favorite subjects . . .

time, that fantastic force that does -
all its jobs so gradually and in
conspicuously.
I got to thinking about how a
tall, brown-haired undergrad with
n Stanford jacket and a crew cut
who just walked in the RBR would
in a few years be sitting in a stuffy
office iti a noisy city or climbing
one of those precipitous, ugly hills
in Korea. And about how maybe
he'd wish he was back on the

Farm.
About how the rains and winds since the Univer
sity's opening in 1891 have cut down the brown sand
stone of the Quad a few millionths of an inch.
About the same stones 011 the Quad that we walk
on every day once housed the undergraduate shoes
ol an engineering major who went on to become
President of the United States, of a trio of present
Hollywood residents named Lloyd Nolan, Jack Palanse
and Doodles Weaver, of playright Maxwell Anderson,
of an author called John Steinbeck, and of a fellow
named Luther Evans, who now is the Librarian of
Congress.
About how the classrooms of this University have
seated 77,457 students in 02 years, some of whom
have become hank presidents, and some of whom
have died paupers, some of whom have been foot

ball coaches, hank tellers, engineers, psychiatrists,
insurance salesmen, lawyers, janitors, teachers, bone
surgeons, newspaper writers, taxicah drivers, zoolo
gists, actors, presidents of sprawling companies, and
garbage collectors.
About the story the aged and ageless oak tree in
front of the main libe could tell if it could only talk.
About the approximate 1,240,000 man-hours of learn
ing that one of the rooms in the inner Quad has been
the scene of, and about how most of those hours have
been forgotten long ago.
About how, in principle, things are the same on the
Farm now as they were 50 years ago; the wearing
apparel is different and they have different fads now,
but the smoke goes up the chimneys just like it did
then, and we talk about classes, profs, dates, and ath
letics, just like they did then.
About how babies just now beginning to piece to
gether sentences will in several years be drinking
coffee at the Cellar, running for touchdowns at the
Stadium, and directing student activities from the
ASSU office.
About how we in school will return in the years to
come with gray hair, or no hair at all. and with our
faces wrinkled and our walk a little slower and our
posture a little more bent. And about hdVv it will
all look the same and yet so different. The buildings
will all be the same, but the faces will be so un
familiar. And about how the youngsters will look at
us like we look at the oldsters now and think, "Who
are they?"
And about how we'll do something that we scorn
now . . . long for "the good old days."
