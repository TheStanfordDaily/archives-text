# PRELIMINARY GAMES
## Indian Frosh Play Pair Of Early Tilts 
### PHIL HERMAN 
Dick Clegg's undefeated freshman
cagers will meet their California
counterparts in a pair of games this
weekend. The Papooses will travel
to Berkeley for a contest at 4 this
afternoon and then return to Palo
Alto for another tilt at 4 tomorrow
afternoon.
So far this season Clegg's squad
has rung up three straight victo
ries, all last quarter. Victims of
the frosh were the LISF Fresh
men, 51 to 48; Menlo - Atherton
High, (if) to 32; and San Mateo
High. 81 to 18.
The Cal Cubs, under the tutelage
of Art Gallon, have meanwhile
compiled a five - and - one record.
They have defeated Balboa High,
Alameda High, Sir Francis Drake
High, Burlingame High, and Fre
mont High. The Cubs bowed to the
Frosh.
Probable starting lineups for the
Stanford Frosh will be Jack Hen
dricks and Gunnar Christiansen at
forwards, Paul Perko at center, and
Don Wagner and George Sellick at
guards.
The California Frosh will probably
line up with Ralph Blue and Jerry
Ragust at forwards, Roy Polking
horne at center, and Al Wintrub
and either Phil Bluer or Paul Er
rero at guards.
