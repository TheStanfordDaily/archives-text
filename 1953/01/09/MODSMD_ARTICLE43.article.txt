Basketball is a very simple game and at the same time a complex one.
The object is simple—put the ball through a basket, but the procedure
of so doing is indeed complex and may take many forms.
Basketball teams are made up of five men, and today the tall man is
emphasized, which gives advantage in putting a 12-inch diameter hall
into an 18-inch diameter basket suspended from a glass backboard
ten feet above the wooden floor. And the length of the floor may vary
but averages about !H> feet, while width is about 45 feet.
The team that gets the most points wins. Two points are given for each
field goal, which is a shot against an active defense as contrasted to the
one point awarded on a successful free throw which is taken with both
teams lined up, and comes as the result of a foul. There are no ties in
basketball because overtime periods are played to determine a winner if
the regulation 40-minute game ends deadlocked.
The game, which is divided into 10-minute quarters, begins with a
referee throwing the ball up in the center circle. Two tall men jump for
it, trying to tap it to a teammate so they may start their offense. The
team getting the ball starts toward their offensive goal while the other
team sets up a defense. In moving the ball down court the team must
dribble it, which is a bouncing action, or must pass it. A ball cannot be
picked up and carried, or it is awarded to the other side out of bounds,
and they start on the offense.
An offense can take one of two main styles, fast break, or a hall con
trol game. A fast break requires a lot of running and quick shots in
hope of making a basket before the defense can get set. A ball control
game sees the offensive team set up deliberate, plays, and this offense
attempts to score by bringing a set defense out of position. There are
many deviations of these which may be used during a game.
There are also two principal defenses, a man-to-man and a zone. A
man-to-man will find each member of the defensive team guarding a
member of the offensive unit; it is an individual type of defense. The zone
finds the entire team shifting with the ball wherever the ball goes. This is
a team defense and the entire defense depends upon unity. There are sev
eral deviations and combinations of both of these defenses.
When a team shoots for a basket and misses, the result is a rebound
off the backboard, which is the glass board behind the basket, and both
teams attempt to control the ball in a wild jumping under the basket. If
the defensive team gets it, they become the offense and head toward the
other basket while the other squad runs back to set up a defense. If the
team which shot the ball retrieves it they may shoot until they lose pos
session, or make a basket. In the result of a basket being made the de
fensive team gets the ball out of bounds and becomes th6-offensive team.
In the event that two players on opposite teams grab the ball at the
same time a jump ball occurs between the two and the referee throws the
ball up and the players jump for it in the same manner that a quarter is
started.
Fouls are called by either of the referees for violations which hamper
a player shooting or the general finesse and speed of basketball. The
player fouled gets a free throw, sometimes two, depending upon the
infraction, while the player making the foul gets a personal foul, five of
which put him out of the game. A new rule in force for the first time
this season is hoped to cut down fouling by awarding extra free throws,
and in cutting down fouling keep basketball the fast, driving, exciting
spectator sport which il is.

same time a jump ball occurs between the two and the referee throws the
ball up and the players jump for it in the same manner that a quarter is
started.
Fouls are called by either of the referees for violations which hamper
a player shooting or the general finesse and speed of basketball. The
player fouled gets a free throw, sometimes two, depending upon the
infraction, while the player making the foul gets a personal foul, five of
which put him out of the game. A new rule in force for the first time
this season is hoped to cut down fouling by awarding extra free throws,
and in cutting down fouling keep basketball the fast, driving, exciting
spectator sport which il is.

Basketball is a very simple game and at the same time a complex one.
The object is simple—put the ball through a basket, but the procedure
of so doing is indeed complex and may take many forms.
Basketball teams are made up of five men, and today the tall man is
emphasized, which gives advantage in putting a 12-inch diameter hall
into an 18-inch diameter basket suspended from a glass backboard
ten feet above the wooden floor. And the length of the floor may vary
but averages about !H> feet, while width is about 45 feet.
The team that gets the most points wins. Two points are given for each
field goal, which is a shot against an active defense as contrasted to the
one point awarded on a successful free throw which is taken with both
teams lined up, and comes as the result of a foul. There are no ties in
basketball because overtime periods are played to determine a winner if
the regulation 40-minute game ends deadlocked.
The game, which is divided into 10-minute quarters, begins with a
referee throwing the ball up in the center circle. Two tall men jump for
it, trying to tap it to a teammate so they may start their offense. The
team getting the ball starts toward their offensive goal while the other
team sets up a defense. In moving the ball down court the team must
dribble it, which is a bouncing action, or must pass it. A ball cannot be
picked up and carried, or it is awarded to the other side out of bounds,
and they start on the offense.
An offense can take one of two main styles, fast break, or a hall con
trol game. A fast break requires a lot of running and quick shots in
hope of making a basket before the defense can get set. A ball control
game sees the offensive team set up deliberate, plays, and this offense
attempts to score by bringing a set defense out of position. There are
many deviations of these which may be used during a game.
There are also two principal defenses, a man-to-man and a zone. A
man-to-man will find each member of the defensive team guarding a
member of the offensive unit; it is an individual type of defense. The zone
finds the entire team shifting with the ball wherever the ball goes. This is
a team defense and the entire defense depends upon unity. There are sev
eral deviations and combinations of both of these defenses.
When a team shoots for a basket and misses, the result is a rebound
off the backboard, which is the glass board behind the basket, and both
teams attempt to control the ball in a wild jumping under the basket. If
the defensive team gets it, they become the offense and head toward the
other basket while the other squad runs back to set up a defense. If the
team which shot the ball retrieves it they may shoot until they lose pos
session, or make a basket. In the result of a basket being made the de
fensive team gets the ball out of bounds and becomes th6-offensive team.
In the event that two players on opposite teams grab the ball at the
same time a jump ball occurs between the two and the referee throws the
ball up and the players jump for it in the same manner that a quarter is
started.
