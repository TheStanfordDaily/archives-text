# Giant New Atom Smasher Will Operate at Stanford
## 'Mark III’ to Accelerate Nuclear Study 
### ROY BROUN 
Stanford's recently unveiled
j giant atom smasher will soon
j be speeding minute atomic par
ticles through its 220-foot length
at energies up to one billion
electron volts.
Called Mark 111, the world's most
i powerful electron linear accelerator,
not yet fully completed, is a machine
which does a job similar to the cyclo
tron, shooting its particles through
a straight copper barrel instead of a
circular path. It is located in the
Microwave Laboratory, behind old
Sequoia Hall.
The enormous energies available
for scientific research from the linear
accelerator, and the machine itself are
largely the result of the work of one
man and his invention. The man was
Dr. William Webster Hansen, and his
invention was the klystron tube.
Hansen, a Stanford graduate, de
veloped the klystron tube during
I World War 11. Essentially an ex
tremely powerful radio broadcast
ing tube, it made radar possible. In
its present form at the Microwave
Lab, however, the tubes have a
more scientific use—they generate
waves that push electrons along at
99.99999 per cent the speed of light.
Electrons ride the radio waves in
much the same way that surf-boards
ride ocean waves. Each group of
electrons sits just ahead of the crest
of a wave and is shoved on by the
wave's forward momentum.
I The electrons reach maximum
velocity only four feet after they
start down the barrel. Since nothing
can exceed the speed of light, they use
the rest of the energy given them by
the klystrons in gaining mass, arriv
ing at the target 2,000 times, their
original weight.
Hansen, first director of the Mi
crowave Lab, will never see his
work completed. He died in 1949
after conceiving the idea and start
ing construction on the accelerator.
His work is being carried on by
Dr. Edward L, Gin/ton, present
director of the laboratory. Over
four years of labor have gone into
the construction of the giant atom
splitter.
The accelerator consists of three
main parts—a firing chamber, a
buncher, and a gun tube 3.25 inches
in diameter and 220 feet long. Essen
tially the smasher is an elongated
vacuum tube with a filament at one
end and a target at the other.
Electrons are kicked oIT the fila
ment in the firing chamber with an
80,000-volt charge of electricity in

bunches of 100 billion each. This
happens (>0 times a second, with
each bunch having a velocity of
one-half the speed of light.
Next two feet of the accelerator
consists of the buncher, where the
electrons are accelerated to virtually
the speed of light and grouped into
compact bunches. Here the klystron
tubes take over and speed the elec
trons along the gun tube with their
waves. When the accelerator is run
ning at maximum power, there will
be 21 klystron tubes, each powering
a 10-foot segment of the barrel.
The klystrons are discharged <>0
times a second to synchronize with
the electrons leaving the firing
chamber, each discharge lasting
only one-millionth of a second.
At peak operation the 21 tubes use
enough power to light the city of
San Francisco.
Controlled by magnets, the elec

tron beam can be adjusted to hit any
one of six targets, three located along
the length of the barrel, and three
at the end.
So far, the linear accelerator has
generated 350,000,00(1 electron volts
—only one-third of its eventual
strength of one billion volts. Only
one other atom smasher in the
world can meet the billion-volt
mark, the cosmotron at Brook
haven National Laboratory, New
York.
High energy electrons are excel
lent tools for exploring atomic nu
clei. The scientist uses them as a
probe into the interior of a nucleus,
as they are so small that they readily
pass through without disturbing the
atomic structure.
Research that can be done with
this new tool of science will in
clude experiments to determine
size and structure of atomic nu

clei, and the exact nature of elec
tricity. The gun can also be used
for making new sub-atomic par
ticles, such as mesons, supposed to
be the substance that holds nuclei
together.
A six-foot sister to the accelerator
is being built by Stanford for use in
the School of Medicine in treatment
of cancer. Cheaply produced, this
smaller model would put high
cnergy cancer treatment within the
reach of almost every hospital in the
nation.
Biggest job ahead for the comple
tion of the accelerator is construc
tion of a $250,000 end station. An
extension of the Microwave Lab it
self, the end station will house elabo
rate testing devices and other equip
ment required in experiments.

Stanford's recently unveiled
j giant atom smasher will soon
j be speeding minute atomic par
ticles through its 220-foot length
at energies up to one billion
electron volts.
Called Mark 111, the world's most
i powerful electron linear accelerator,
not yet fully completed, is a machine
which does a job similar to the cyclo
tron, shooting its particles through
a straight copper barrel instead of a
circular path. It is located in the
Microwave Laboratory, behind old
Sequoia Hall.
The enormous energies available
for scientific research from the linear
accelerator, and the machine itself are
largely the result of the work of one
man and his invention. The man was
Dr. William Webster Hansen, and his
invention was the klystron tube.
Hansen, a Stanford graduate, de
veloped the klystron tube during
I World War 11. Essentially an ex
tremely powerful radio broadcast
ing tube, it made radar possible. In
its present form at the Microwave
Lab, however, the tubes have a
more scientific use—they generate
waves that push electrons along at
99.99999 per cent the speed of light.
Electrons ride the radio waves in
much the same way that surf-boards
ride ocean waves. Each group of
electrons sits just ahead of the crest
of a wave and is shoved on by the
wave's forward momentum.
I The electrons reach maximum
velocity only four feet after they
start down the barrel. Since nothing
can exceed the speed of light, they use
the rest of the energy given them by
the klystrons in gaining mass, arriv
ing at the target 2,000 times, their
original weight.
Hansen, first director of the Mi
crowave Lab, will never see his
work completed. He died in 1949
after conceiving the idea and start
ing construction on the accelerator.
His work is being carried on by
Dr. Edward L, Gin/ton, present
director of the laboratory. Over
four years of labor have gone into
the construction of the giant atom
splitter.
The accelerator consists of three
main parts—a firing chamber, a
buncher, and a gun tube 3.25 inches
in diameter and 220 feet long. Essen
tially the smasher is an elongated
vacuum tube with a filament at one
end and a target at the other.
Electrons are kicked oIT the fila
ment in the firing chamber with an
80,000-volt charge of electricity in

bunches of 100 billion each. This
happens (>0 times a second, with
each bunch having a velocity of
one-half the speed of light.
Next two feet of the accelerator
consists of the buncher, where the
electrons are accelerated to virtually
the speed of light and grouped into
compact bunches. Here the klystron
tubes take over and speed the elec
trons along the gun tube with their
waves. When the accelerator is run
ning at maximum power, there will
be 21 klystron tubes, each powering
a 10-foot segment of the barrel.
The klystrons are discharged <>0
times a second to synchronize with
the electrons leaving the firing
chamber, each discharge lasting
only one-millionth of a second.
At peak operation the 21 tubes use
enough power to light the city of
San Francisco.
Controlled by magnets, the elec

tron beam can be adjusted to hit any
one of six targets, three located along
the length of the barrel, and three
at the end.
So far, the linear accelerator has
generated 350,000,00(1 electron volts
—only one-third of its eventual
strength of one billion volts. Only
one other atom smasher in the
world can meet the billion-volt
mark, the cosmotron at Brook
haven National Laboratory, New
York.
High energy electrons are excel
lent tools for exploring atomic nu
clei. The scientist uses them as a
probe into the interior of a nucleus,
as they are so small that they readily
pass through without disturbing the
atomic structure.

ment in the firing chamber with an
80,000-volt charge of electricity in

bunches of 100 billion each. This
happens (>0 times a second, with
each bunch having a velocity of
one-half the speed of light.
Next two feet of the accelerator
consists of the buncher, where the
electrons are accelerated to virtually
the speed of light and grouped into
compact bunches. Here the klystron
tubes take over and speed the elec
trons along the gun tube with their
waves. When the accelerator is run
ning at maximum power, there will
be 21 klystron tubes, each powering
a 10-foot segment of the barrel.
The klystrons are discharged <>0
times a second to synchronize with
the electrons leaving the firing
chamber, each discharge lasting
only one-millionth of a second.
At peak operation the 21 tubes use
enough power to light the city of
San Francisco.
Controlled by magnets, the elec

tron beam can be adjusted to hit any
one of six targets, three located along
the length of the barrel, and three
at the end.
So far, the linear accelerator has
generated 350,000,00(1 electron volts
—only one-third of its eventual
strength of one billion volts. Only
one other atom smasher in the
world can meet the billion-volt
mark, the cosmotron at Brook
haven National Laboratory, New
York.
High energy electrons are excel
lent tools for exploring atomic nu
clei. The scientist uses them as a
probe into the interior of a nucleus,
as they are so small that they readily
pass through without disturbing the
atomic structure.
Research that can be done with
this new tool of science will in
clude experiments to determine
size and structure of atomic nu

clei, and the exact nature of elec
tricity. The gun can also be used
for making new sub-atomic par
ticles, such as mesons, supposed to
be the substance that holds nuclei
together.
A six-foot sister to the accelerator
is being built by Stanford for use in
the School of Medicine in treatment
of cancer. Cheaply produced, this
smaller model would put high
cnergy cancer treatment within the
reach of almost every hospital in the
nation.
Biggest job ahead for the comple
tion of the accelerator is construc
tion of a $250,000 end station. An
extension of the Microwave Lab it
self, the end station will house elabo
rate testing devices and other equip
ment required in experiments.

Stanford's recently unveiled
j giant atom smasher will soon
j be speeding minute atomic par
ticles through its 220-foot length
at energies up to one billion
electron volts.
Called Mark 111, the world's most
i powerful electron linear accelerator,
not yet fully completed, is a machine
which does a job similar to the cyclo
tron, shooting its particles through
a straight copper barrel instead of a
circular path. It is located in the
Microwave Laboratory, behind old
Sequoia Hall.
The enormous energies available
for scientific research from the linear
accelerator, and the machine itself are
largely the result of the work of one
man and his invention. The man was
Dr. William Webster Hansen, and his
invention was the klystron tube.
Hansen, a Stanford graduate, de
veloped the klystron tube during
I World War 11. Essentially an ex
tremely powerful radio broadcast
ing tube, it made radar possible. In
its present form at the Microwave
Lab, however, the tubes have a
more scientific use—they generate
waves that push electrons along at
99.99999 per cent the speed of light.
Electrons ride the radio waves in
much the same way that surf-boards
ride ocean waves. Each group of
electrons sits just ahead of the crest
of a wave and is shoved on by the
wave's forward momentum.
I The electrons reach maximum
velocity only four feet after they
start down the barrel. Since nothing
can exceed the speed of light, they use
the rest of the energy given them by
the klystrons in gaining mass, arriv
ing at the target 2,000 times, their
original weight.
Hansen, first director of the Mi
crowave Lab, will never see his
work completed. He died in 1949
after conceiving the idea and start
ing construction on the accelerator.
His work is being carried on by
Dr. Edward L, Gin/ton, present
director of the laboratory. Over
four years of labor have gone into
the construction of the giant atom
splitter.
The accelerator consists of three
main parts—a firing chamber, a
buncher, and a gun tube 3.25 inches
in diameter and 220 feet long. Essen
tially the smasher is an elongated
vacuum tube with a filament at one
end and a target at the other.

ment in the firing chamber with an
