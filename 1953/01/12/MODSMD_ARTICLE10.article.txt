Dr. Felix Bloch, Stanford's Nobel
laureate, told a group of his col
leagues Saturday night-that he had
brought home from Sweden some
thing more valuable than the prizeâ€”
"a renewed faith in the supreme
dignity of the academic profession."
Speaking to 250 Stanford faculty
members and guests, the Stanford
physicist declared, "I attribute to
the occasion of this gathering a
purely symbolic significance. It sig
nifies to me that knowledge and
learning .still command the respect
of the world."
-He continued, "I don't suppose I

have to tell there are at
tempts under w ay to deprive us of
our most precious possession, our
academic freedom.
"Against these attempts I have
brought home an antidote which is
more valuable to me than the prize
and which you are all asked to
share with me. It is a renewed
strength and faith in the supreme
dignity of the academic profession."
Stanford's president, Dr. Wallace
Sterling, who was co - host with
Stanford trustees of the banquet at
Lagunita Court, introduced the No
bel prize winner.
