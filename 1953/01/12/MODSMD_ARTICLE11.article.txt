# Foreign Scholar 'Finds' Democracy
## 
### WIN GRIFFITH 
(The city of Home, once the
center of a world empire, lies
in a region of gently sloping
hills in the center of the Italian
Peninsula. It is the "Eternal
City," a city of fountains, St.
Peter's, friendly people, and a
thousand magnificent examples
of man's artistic genius. It is
seen by the American tourist
who follows the sight-seeing
guides as a clean and a beauti
ful city, but it is also a city where
poverty and gold-trimmed his
tory meet.)
Elena Borghese, an ASSU foreign
scholar living at Storey, has come to
the United States and Stanford from
the city of Home not merely to study
the courses offered to an Interna
tional Relations major and learn
more about the American people, but
to get a good look at herself, her
people, and her country with the
"perspective of a student abroad."
The 20-year-old -foreign scholar
(who unfairly describes herself as
"bulldog-faced and potato-nosed")

admits that in the first three months
of her experience at Stanford she has
gone through a change of both per
which she has partially fulfilled a

hope to overcome a "previously dog
sonality and ideas, a change in
matic philosophy and manner."
During that change and during

the three months she has been study
ing and living in this country, Elepa
Borghese lias set Italy and the
United States side by side and has
come to the following conclusions:
1. The youth of Italy are inclined
to the extreme political philoso
phies. communism and fascism.
Many of them think of democracy
as a joke, "something to laugh at."
They think that democracy is too
idealistic to work, too vague for
the young person to grasp as a
strong and confident belief.
2. Americans, especially the
young, are "amazingly tactful."
They show a sincere interest in
the ideas of the foreigner, and
their questions demonstrate a
"kind, considerate, and tactful
manner that cannot he found in
many Italians."
By considering these differences,
Elena maintains that she has changed
from the person she was last Sep
tember, when she arrived in this
country, and in 1945, when as a
young girl she watched her country
emerge from a world war.
She has changed partially as a
result of a UNESCO - sponsored
World Youth Forum held in England
in 1948. At that conference she was
able to talk, study, and travel with

students of 13 nations. She was able
to participate in "clear, objective
discussions" and "discover such curi
ous phenomena as a working democ
racy, international understanding, a
belief in one's own principles, and a
tolerance for those of others."
And since she lias been at Stan
ford she has seen those ideas not
as "hazy notions that exist some
where across the sea" hut as actual
conditions in a modern nation. She
has discovered a "practical appli
cation of democracy" and has he
come optimistic about the strength
ening of democracy in Italy.
After June, the foreign scholar
will return to Italy to finish her edu
cation at the University of Rome.
She will take with her not only an
amazing variety pf "American en
thusiasms" (which include milk
shakes, jukeboxes, Steinbeck,
Mickey Spillane, Stanford. American
slang, and "Old Fashioneds") but an
optimism for Italy, a respect for the
United States, and a confidence in
the "working democracy."
With hopes of becoming either a
social worker, journalist, or a mem
ber of the Italian foreign service,
Elena Borghese also plans to "take
that optimism, respect, and confi
dence home so that other people in
Italy may possibly share it."

1. The youth of Italy are inclined
to the extreme political philoso
phies. communism and fascism.
Many of them think of democracy
as a joke, "something to laugh at."
They think that democracy is too
idealistic to work, too vague for
the young person to grasp as a
strong and confident belief.
2. Americans, especially the
young, are "amazingly tactful."
They show a sincere interest in
the ideas of the foreigner, and
their questions demonstrate a
"kind, considerate, and tactful
manner that cannot he found in
many Italians."
By considering these differences,
Elena maintains that she has changed
from the person she was last Sep
tember, when she arrived in this
country, and in 1945, when as a
young girl she watched her country
emerge from a world war.
She has changed partially as a
result of a UNESCO - sponsored
World Youth Forum held in England
in 1948. At that conference she was
able to talk, study, and travel with

students of 13 nations. She was able
to participate in "clear, objective
discussions" and "discover such curi
ous phenomena as a working democ
racy, international understanding, a
belief in one's own principles, and a
tolerance for those of others."
And since she lias been at Stan
ford she has seen those ideas not
as "hazy notions that exist some
where across the sea" hut as actual
conditions in a modern nation. She
has discovered a "practical appli
cation of democracy" and has he
come optimistic about the strength
ening of democracy in Italy.
After June, the foreign scholar
will return to Italy to finish her edu
cation at the University of Rome.
She will take with her not only an
amazing variety pf "American en
thusiasms" (which include milk
shakes, jukeboxes, Steinbeck,
Mickey Spillane, Stanford. American
slang, and "Old Fashioneds") but an
optimism for Italy, a respect for the
United States, and a confidence in
the "working democracy."
With hopes of becoming either a
social worker, journalist, or a mem
ber of the Italian foreign service,
Elena Borghese also plans to "take
that optimism, respect, and confi
dence home so that other people in
Italy may possibly share it."

(The city of Home, once the
center of a world empire, lies
in a region of gently sloping
hills in the center of the Italian
Peninsula. It is the "Eternal
City," a city of fountains, St.
Peter's, friendly people, and a
thousand magnificent examples
of man's artistic genius. It is
seen by the American tourist
who follows the sight-seeing
guides as a clean and a beauti
ful city, but it is also a city where
poverty and gold-trimmed his
tory meet.)
Elena Borghese, an ASSU foreign
scholar living at Storey, has come to
the United States and Stanford from
the city of Home not merely to study
the courses offered to an Interna

more about the American people, but
to get a good look at herself, her
people, and her country with the
"perspective of a student abroad."
The 20-year-old -foreign scholar
(who unfairly describes herself as
"bulldog-faced and potato-nosed")

admits that in the first three months
of her experience at Stanford she has
gone through a change of both per
which she has partially fulfilled a

hope to overcome a "previously dog
sonality and ideas, a change in
matic philosophy and manner."
During that change and during

the three months she has been study
ing and living in this country, Elepa
Borghese lias set Italy and the
