# LUNCHEON MEETING TODAY
## Scientists to Discuss Immigration Bill 
### 
Further action on the new Mc-
Carran - Walter immigration hill
will he discussed today by Stan
ford's chapter of the Federation of
American Scientists.
The group, composed of ahout
30 graduate students and faculty
members in science, are working
toward complete revision of the
hill, which went into effect on
Christmas day. They will meet for
luncheon in the lower lounge of
the Women's Clubhouse.
President Truman's Commission
on Immigration and Naturalization
has upheld the viewpoint of the sci
entists following the submission of
a statement and other information
by the group.
In its statement, Stanford's FAS
chapter emphasized the necessity
for scientists to travel in order to
meet and exchange ideas with
other scientists. They declared:
â€¢ "Thee tt'ect of the immigration
lavv is and will be to seriously
impede travel of foreign scientists
to this country. This deprives U.S.
scientists of the benefits of contact
with their foreign colleagues and
furthermore it creates an unfa
vorable impression of U.S. 'friend
liness' oil foreign scientists."
The Stanford chapter also made
available to the Presidential com
mission an issue of the "Bulletin of
Atomic Scientists," which was de
voted to the documentation of the
delays and inconveniences experi
enced by visiting scientists because
of the restrictive provisions of the
immigration law.
