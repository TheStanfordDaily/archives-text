# The 						Rosenberg Case
## 
### 
Latest among the thorny problems which
President Truman is apparently going to shrug
ojf upon President elect Dwight Eisenhower
is the question of clemency lor Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg, sentenced to die lor violation of
the Espionage Act.
The Rosenbergs, scheduled to be executed
Wednesday, filed a formal petition for clem
ency with the Justice Department last Satur
day. The petition, which grants them an
automatic stay of execution until it is decided
upon, will be reviewed by Justice and then
given to the President for decision.
It is reported that Truman will defer action
and let the new administration face the diffi
cult issue, clouded with a mass of Communist
and left wing propaganda and involved with
the American position in world politics, besides
the initial question of guilt or innocence.
More than a year ago in the Federal Dis
trict Court of Judge Samuel H. Kaufman, the
Rosenbergs were convicted of "giving secret
information to a foreign government during the
period from 1944 to 1950."
Working in a ring that included such people
as David and Ruth Greenglass, Harry Gold,
Morton Sobell, and Klaus Fuchs of England,
the Rosenbergs helped Russia learn in June
1944—a full year before the American public
—that we had the atom bomb; that shortly after
the Nagasaki bombing the Russians had de
tailed drawings of the bomb's workings, the
principles entailed, and the differences be
tween the improved Nagasaki bomb and the
earlier Alamogordo test model. Other military
secrets like the proximity fuse and plans for
proposed satellite space stations were handed
also over to Soviet Russia. A good condensed
narration of their unpretty activities may be
found in U.S. News and World Report, April 6,
1951.
In sentencing the Rosenbergs, Judge
Kaufman said: "I consider your crime worse
than murder." But, despite confessions by
fellow conspirktors, the convicted couple
devoutly maintained their innocence, and
still do. Upon appeal the judgment was
affirmed by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
The Supreme Court denied a writ of certiorari
and later again denied a review of the case

findings. The final route to escape death is
the plea for clemency.
Clearing away the mass of propaganda ap
peals like "The Rosenbergs were model par
ents; save them for their children's sake," we
\ „
find among the supplicant's arguments: "the
sentence is too severe, either in relation to that
handed other guilty parties, or in relation to
the crime committed."
As an example, Dr. Emil Klaus Fuchs, an
other member of the ring and possibly a more
important one, was sentenced to 14 years in
prison by an English court. On this basis, his
tory only will tell whether the Rosenbergs'
penalty is too harsh, or Fuchs' too lenient.
The act of espionage was implicitly con
sidered throughout the trial both bv the
prosecution and defense as a sort olfZlittle
treason."
Treason is briefly defined as aiding an
enemy, while espionage consists merely of giv
ing secrets to a foreign power. Connection was
given between the two when later develop
ments showed that Russia was a sort of "half
enemy" in 1944.
But only two people have ever previously
been sentenced to die for treason in the United
States, and none for espionage. Thus the de
fense says the sentence is without precedent.
In view of the voluminous propaganda to
date, it is very likely that the Communists
may hail the U.S. as "butchers of humanity"
it the execution sentence is carried out.
Consequently, President Truman, or more
likely President-elect Eisenhower, is faced with
a tremendous decision, weighing the life of two
humans and the safety and well being of the
nation.
We note the statement by Mr. Justice Frank
of the Court of Appeals: "Since two of the
defendants must be put to death the judg
ment stands; it goes without sayjnq that we
have scrutinized the record with extraordi
nary care."
Having read portions of the case history and
having faith in the justice of review of
the most eminent jurists in the country, we
urge the decision be made to deny the plea
for clemency, impartially and without vin
dictiveness.—Jim Madison.
