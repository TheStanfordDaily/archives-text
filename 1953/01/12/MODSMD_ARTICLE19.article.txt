# BULL SESSION

### DICK MANSFIELD 
As long as Ihe fields are boggy and Ihe paths arc
quagmires and us birdwatchers can'l get outside to
watch birds, we must all adjourn to the Main Reading
Room at the Libe, where we can study Literal
Humanities.
Literal Humanities, of cotp|o, ' s the science of ob
serving what the other guytfl doing and speculating

why he is doing it. A L.ieral
Humanitarian lurks behind a
giant tome away in the back of
the reading room, where he can
observe and be unobserved. Some
Literal Humanitarians take notes.
But the real professionals have a
memory for types, and can easily
spot, the better-known sorts of
Humanities around thy Main Li
brary.
Broadly speaking, anyone who

enters the Main Reading Room at the Libc is either
(1) a librarian, (2) a student., (3) an idler, and (4) a
Literal Humanitarian. Distinction between the types
is in some rases difficult.
For instance, both librarians and students have
been known to carry piles of books, wear thick
glasses, scurfy about, and answer salutations witb
vague sounds. One inay distinguish between a li
brarian and a student by asking where to find a
book. A student will try to be helpful, look wor
ried, scratch liis head, look through his notebook,
scurry about. The librarian, on the Other hand,
views you with a certain contempt and then ges
tures vaguely and vanishes.
Perhaps less difficult to determine is the difference

between a student and an idler. Am idler generally
stares at the wall for a time, and then falls asleep.
His head falls on his book. Watch this type closely.
It might he a nearsighted student scanning some
Sanskrit. Say something offhand to the apparent
sleeper. If he rouses and answers, he is probably an
idler.
We will not deal with the subtle differences between
an idler and a Literal Humanitarian.
Of course, there are subsidiary classifications.
Under the genus idler comes (he specie socialite,
who wanders in to shoot the hull with a few friends.
Maybe the Brothers are all sitting around a tahle.
In walks Abe. Old Ahe! Whispered greetings shake
the walls. The brothers arc all studying Kcon, and
start comparing notes. Sometimes librarians emerge
from the stacks and the socialites get bounccd.
Willi students are classified unsure students, who
pace Ihe length of the reading room every five min
utes to check a spelling in the dictionary. Moiit of
these unsure students wear wooden shoes, or else
just .stamp their feet. Why? IVlayhc to disconcert the
Literal Humanitarians . After a Literal Humani
tarian, hearing a thunder of hoofs, has looked up inlo
the same face for the fifth time, he is likely to lake
it long Humanities break and try again tomorrow.
But the most fascinating specimen of all to
Literal Humanitarian is the one which he sees
when, peering over the edge of his giant tome, lie
looks directly into a pair of red-rimmed eyes star
ing right back at him. This is a fellow Literal
Humanitarian, and his behavior is the most in
explicable and disconcerting of all the types at the
Main Reading Koom.

memory for types, and can easily
spot, the better-known sorts of
Humanities around thy Main Li
brary.
Broadly speaking, anyone who

enters the Main Reading Room at the Libc is either
(1) a librarian, (2) a student., (3) an idler, and (4) a
Literal Humanitarian. Distinction between the types
is in some rases difficult.
For instance, both librarians and students have
been known to carry piles of books, wear thick
glasses, scurfy about, and answer salutations witb
vague sounds. One inay distinguish between a li
brarian and a student by asking where to find a
book. A student will try to be helpful, look wor
ried, scratch liis head, look through his notebook,
scurry about. The librarian, on the Other hand,
views you with a certain contempt and then ges
tures vaguely and vanishes.
Perhaps less difficult to determine is the difference

between a student and an idler. Am idler generally
stares at the wall for a time, and then falls asleep.
His head falls on his book. Watch this type closely.
It might he a nearsighted student scanning some
Sanskrit. Say something offhand to the apparent
sleeper. If he rouses and answers, he is probably an
idler.
We will not deal with the subtle differences between
an idler and a Literal Humanitarian.
Of course, there are subsidiary classifications.
Under the genus idler comes (he specie socialite,
who wanders in to shoot the hull with a few friends.
Maybe the Brothers are all sitting around a tahle.
In walks Abe. Old Ahe! Whispered greetings shake
the walls. The brothers arc all studying Kcon, and
start comparing notes. Sometimes librarians emerge
from the stacks and the socialites get bounccd.
Willi students are classified unsure students, who
pace Ihe length of the reading room every five min
utes to check a spelling in the dictionary. Moiit of
these unsure students wear wooden shoes, or else
just .stamp their feet. Why? IVlayhc to disconcert the
Literal Humanitarians . After a Literal Humani
tarian, hearing a thunder of hoofs, has looked up inlo
the same face for the fifth time, he is likely to lake
it long Humanities break and try again tomorrow.
But the most fascinating specimen of all to
Literal Humanitarian is the one which he sees
when, peering over the edge of his giant tome, lie
looks directly into a pair of red-rimmed eyes star
ing right back at him. This is a fellow Literal
Humanitarian, and his behavior is the most in
explicable and disconcerting of all the types at the
Main Reading Koom.

As long as Ihe fields are boggy and Ihe paths arc
quagmires and us birdwatchers can'l get outside to
watch birds, we must all adjourn to the Main Reading
Room at the Libe, where we can study Literal
Humanities.
Literal Humanities, of cotp|o, ' s the science of ob
serving what the other guytfl doing and speculating

why he is doing it. A L.ieral
Humanitarian lurks behind a
giant tome away in the back of
the reading room, where he can
observe and be unobserved. Some
Literal Humanitarians take notes.
