# Backboard Control Gives Indians Upset Victory Over Berkeley Bears Saturday
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
The form chart said that Cali-1
fornia would rack up two more
wins in their march to the PCC
title. But the Stanford basket
bailers threw the odds-makers
for a loop in the Pavilion, Satur
day night, as they handed the
Bears a 76 to 60 thumping, after
having bowed to the same Cali
fornia guintet, 68 to 54, at Berke
ley the previous evening.
The Indian win, coupled with J
UCLA's victory over USC the same !
night, left the Southern Division j
standings just where they were be- I
fore the week end began. California j
and USC, with 3 and 1, are still tied ;
for first, and Stanford and UCLA,
with 1 and 3, tied for last.
Although the Cards' triumph
before the home crowd Saturday
must be classified as an upset, the ]
win was no fluke. Except for the !
first five minutes, Nibs Price's
squad was thoroughly outplayed.
Bob Burnett's charges beat the J
Bears at their own game, offensive J
and defensive rebounding.
Oleg Suzdaleff, Ron Tomsic, j
George Zaninovich, Dave Epperson, |
Don DeLong, and Russ Lawler all !
put together one of their finest games |
of the year and stole the show from I
the Bears' tandem on the backboards.
This troupe was so effective fhat
Cal's hig scoring threat of Boh j
McKeen was rendered virtually j
ineffectual, while Hob Albo and
John Ricksen, the Bears' other top j
guns, could garner only two bas
kets between them.
