# Backboard Control Gives Indians Upset Victory Over Berkeley Bears Saturday
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
The form chart said that Cali-1
fornia would rack up two more
wins in their march to the PCC
title. But the Stanford basket
bailers threw the odds-makers
for a loop in the Pavilion, Satur
day night, as they handed the
Bears a 76 to 60 thumping, after
having bowed to the same Cali
fornia guintet, 68 to 54, at Berke
ley the previous evening.
The Indian win, coupled with J
UCLA's victory over USC the same !
night, left the Southern Division j
standings just where they were be- I
fore the week end began. California j
and USC, with 3 and 1, are still tied ;
for first, and Stanford and UCLA,
with 1 and 3, tied for last.
Although the Cards' triumph
before the home crowd Saturday
must be classified as an upset, the ]
win was no fluke. Except for the !
first five minutes, Nibs Price's
squad was thoroughly outplayed.
Bob Burnett's charges beat the J
Bears at their own game, offensive J
and defensive rebounding.
Oleg Suzdaleff, Ron Tomsic, j
George Zaninovich, Dave Epperson, |
Don DeLong, and Russ Lawler all !
put together one of their finest games |
of the year and stole the show from I
the Bears' tandem on the backboards.
This troupe was so effective fhat
Cal's hig scoring threat of Boh j
McKeen was rendered virtually j
ineffectual, while Hob Albo and
John Ricksen, the Bears' other top j
guns, could garner only two bas
kets between them.
As Frosh coach Dick Clegg put it,
"We took their strength away on re-
I "unds. Anyone who can do that
against California is taking a long
step toward beating them."
After falling behind 11-4 in the
first five minutes, it took the Cards
until late in the second quarter
before they could capture the lead.
Don Carlson's layup finally put the
Ndians in front, 28-27. Cal forged
ahead for the last time on Gray's
bucket, but Zaninovich meshed a
two-pointer and the Stanfords
were in the lead for good. It was
36-.'{2 at the half.
The Bears made only one serious
bid after that. Early in the final quar
{ they crept to within four points
on a drive paced by Bob Matheny,
but DeLong and Tomsic ran a string
of eight straight points to balloon the
margin to 61-49. California never got
closer than ten points following that
barrage.
Tomsic ended up as the night's
L y;h scorer with 19 tallies, while
Suzdaleff was close behind with 16.
McKeen and Matheny were the
Bears' high-point men with 15
apiece.
The real difference between the
clubs could be found on the shot
and rebound charts. Stanford con
nected on 28 of (»7 shots from the
floor to Cal's 23 for 74, and the
Cards hauled down 49 rebounds
to 37.
Burnett was especially elated after
Saturday night's big win.
"We just played the same kind of
hull as we did last night (Friday); we
h.id lots of hustle and drive, only
tonight we got the shooting," he said.
Burnett also was very pleased over
the performance of Zaninovich,
whom he thought played the best
game of his life, and DeLong, with
13 markers, came up with his best
fvoint output of the year.
Friday's affair before over 7,000
at Berkeley found the Indians hus
tling and playing aggressive ball all
the way, but committing numerous
fouls and hitting very poorly from
the floor.
The Card quintet could tank only
2° out of 94 shots for a measly 23 per
cent, and outfouled California 26 to
9. The Bears incidentally made 47
percent from the floor.
Bob McKeen of the Bears took
high point honors for the two
games as he dumped in 34 points
to boost his lead league in scoring
S 78. Tomsic and Suzdaleff each
tallied 31 points apiece to pace the
Indian scorers.
Stanford continues its home con
ference schedule next Friday and
Saturday nights when it hosts the
UCLA Bruins.

As Frosh coach Dick Clegg put it,
"We took their strength away on re-
I "unds. Anyone who can do that
against California is taking a long
step toward beating them."
After falling behind 11-4 in the
first five minutes, it took the Cards
until late in the second quarter
before they could capture the lead.
Don Carlson's layup finally put the
Ndians in front, 28-27. Cal forged
ahead for the last time on Gray's
bucket, but Zaninovich meshed a
two-pointer and the Stanfords
were in the lead for good. It was
36-.'{2 at the half.
The Bears made only one serious
bid after that. Early in the final quar
{ they crept to within four points
on a drive paced by Bob Matheny,
but DeLong and Tomsic ran a string
of eight straight points to balloon the
margin to 61-49. California never got
closer than ten points following that
barrage.
Tomsic ended up as the night's
L y;h scorer with 19 tallies, while
Suzdaleff was close behind with 16.
McKeen and Matheny were the
Bears' high-point men with 15
apiece.
The real difference between the
clubs could be found on the shot
and rebound charts. Stanford con
nected on 28 of (»7 shots from the
floor to Cal's 23 for 74, and the
Cards hauled down 49 rebounds
to 37.
Burnett was especially elated after
Saturday night's big win.
"We just played the same kind of
hull as we did last night (Friday); we
h.id lots of hustle and drive, only
tonight we got the shooting," he said.
Burnett also was very pleased over
the performance of Zaninovich,
whom he thought played the best
game of his life, and DeLong, with
13 markers, came up with his best
fvoint output of the year.
Friday's affair before over 7,000
at Berkeley found the Indians hus
tling and playing aggressive ball all
the way, but committing numerous
fouls and hitting very poorly from
the floor.
The Card quintet could tank only
2° out of 94 shots for a measly 23 per
cent, and outfouled California 26 to
9. The Bears incidentally made 47
percent from the floor.
Bob McKeen of the Bears took
high point honors for the two
games as he dumped in 34 points
to boost his lead league in scoring
S 78. Tomsic and Suzdaleff each
tallied 31 points apiece to pace the
Indian scorers.
Stanford continues its home con
ference schedule next Friday and
Saturday nights when it hosts the
UCLA Bruins.

Burnett also was very pleased over
the performance of Zaninovich,
whom he thought played the best
game of his life, and DeLong, with
13 markers, came up with his best
fvoint output of the year.
Friday's affair before over 7,000
at Berkeley found the Indians hus
tling and playing aggressive ball all
the way, but committing numerous
fouls and hitting very poorly from
the floor.
The Card quintet could tank only
2° out of 94 shots for a measly 23 per
cent, and outfouled California 26 to
9. The Bears incidentally made 47
percent from the floor.
Bob McKeen of the Bears took
high point honors for the two
games as he dumped in 34 points
to boost his lead league in scoring
S 78. Tomsic and Suzdaleff each
tallied 31 points apiece to pace the
Indian scorers.
Stanford continues its home con
ference schedule next Friday and

The form chart said that Cali-1
fornia would rack up two more
wins in their march to the PCC
title. But the Stanford basket
bailers threw the odds-makers
for a loop in the Pavilion, Satur
day night, as they handed the
Bears a 76 to 60 thumping, after
having bowed to the same Cali
fornia guintet, 68 to 54, at Berke
ley the previous evening.
The Indian win, coupled with J
UCLA's victory over USC the same !
night, left the Southern Division j
standings just where they were be- I
fore the week end began. California j
and USC, with 3 and 1, are still tied ;
for first, and Stanford and UCLA,
with 1 and 3, tied for last.
Although the Cards' triumph
before the home crowd Saturday
must be classified as an upset, the ]
win was no fluke. Except for the !
first five minutes, Nibs Price's
squad was thoroughly outplayed.
Bob Burnett's charges beat the J
Bears at their own game, offensive J
and defensive rebounding.
Oleg Suzdaleff, Ron Tomsic, j
George Zaninovich, Dave Epperson, |
Don DeLong, and Russ Lawler all !
put together one of their finest games |
of the year and stole the show from I
the Bears' tandem on the backboards.
This troupe was so effective fhat
Cal's hig scoring threat of Boh j
McKeen was rendered virtually j
ineffectual, while Hob Albo and
John Ricksen, the Bears' other top j
guns, could garner only two bas
kets between them.
As Frosh coach Dick Clegg put it,
"We took their strength away on re-
I "unds. Anyone who can do that
against California is taking a long
step toward beating them."
After falling behind 11-4 in the
first five minutes, it took the Cards
until late in the second quarter
before they could capture the lead.
Don Carlson's layup finally put the
Ndians in front, 28-27. Cal forged
ahead for the last time on Gray's
bucket, but Zaninovich meshed a
two-pointer and the Stanfords
were in the lead for good. It was
36-.'{2 at the half.
The Bears made only one serious
bid after that. Early in the final quar
{ they crept to within four points
on a drive paced by Bob Matheny,
but DeLong and Tomsic ran a string
of eight straight points to balloon the
margin to 61-49. California never got
closer than ten points following that
barrage.
Tomsic ended up as the night's
L y;h scorer with 19 tallies, while
Suzdaleff was close behind with 16.
McKeen and Matheny were the
Bears' high-point men with 15
apiece.
The real difference between the
clubs could be found on the shot
and rebound charts. Stanford con
nected on 28 of (»7 shots from the
floor to Cal's 23 for 74, and the
Cards hauled down 49 rebounds
to 37.

The form chart said that Cali-1
fornia would rack up two more
wins in their march to the PCC
title. But the Stanford basket
bailers threw the odds-makers
for a loop in the Pavilion, Satur
day night, as they handed the
Bears a 76 to 60 thumping, after
having bowed to the same Cali
fornia guintet, 68 to 54, at Berke
ley the previous evening.
The Indian win, coupled with J
UCLA's victory over USC the same !
night, left the Southern Division j
standings just where they were be- I
fore the week end began. California j
and USC, with 3 and 1, are still tied ;
for first, and Stanford and UCLA,
with 1 and 3, tied for last.
Although the Cards' triumph
before the home crowd Saturday
must be classified as an upset, the ]
win was no fluke. Except for the !
first five minutes, Nibs Price's
squad was thoroughly outplayed.
Bob Burnett's charges beat the J
Bears at their own game, offensive J
and defensive rebounding.
Oleg Suzdaleff, Ron Tomsic, j
George Zaninovich, Dave Epperson, |
Don DeLong, and Russ Lawler all !
put together one of their finest games |
of the year and stole the show from I
the Bears' tandem on the backboards.
This troupe was so effective fhat
Cal's hig scoring threat of Boh j
McKeen was rendered virtually j
ineffectual, while Hob Albo and
John Ricksen, the Bears' other top j
guns, could garner only two bas
kets between them.

As Frosh coach Dick Clegg put it,
"We took their strength away on re-
I "unds. Anyone who can do that
against California is taking a long
step toward beating them."
After falling behind 11-4 in the
first five minutes, it took the Cards
until late in the second quarter
before they could capture the lead.
Don Carlson's layup finally put the
Ndians in front, 28-27. Cal forged
ahead for the last time on Gray's
bucket, but Zaninovich meshed a
two-pointer and the Stanfords
were in the lead for good. It was
36-.'{2 at the half.
The Bears made only one serious
bid after that. Early in the final quar
{ they crept to within four points
on a drive paced by Bob Matheny,
but DeLong and Tomsic ran a string
of eight straight points to balloon the
margin to 61-49. California never got
closer than ten points following that
barrage.
Tomsic ended up as the night's
L y;h scorer with 19 tallies, while
Suzdaleff was close behind with 16.
McKeen and Matheny were the
Bears' high-point men with 15
apiece.
The real difference between the
clubs could be found on the shot
and rebound charts. Stanford con
nected on 28 of (»7 shots from the
floor to Cal's 23 for 74, and the
Cards hauled down 49 rebounds
to 37.
Burnett was especially elated after
Saturday night's big win.
"We just played the same kind of
hull as we did last night (Friday); we
h.id lots of hustle and drive, only
tonight we got the shooting," he said.
Burnett also was very pleased over
the performance of Zaninovich,
whom he thought played the best
game of his life, and DeLong, with
13 markers, came up with his best
fvoint output of the year.
Friday's affair before over 7,000
at Berkeley found the Indians hus
tling and playing aggressive ball all
the way, but committing numerous
fouls and hitting very poorly from
the floor.
The Card quintet could tank only
2° out of 94 shots for a measly 23 per
cent, and outfouled California 26 to
9. The Bears incidentally made 47
percent from the floor.
Bob McKeen of the Bears took
high point honors for the two
games as he dumped in 34 points
to boost his lead league in scoring
S 78. Tomsic and Suzdaleff each
tallied 31 points apiece to pace the
Indian scorers.
Stanford continues its home con
ference schedule next Friday and
Saturday nights when it hosts the
UCLA Bruins.
