## Daily Regrets Misunderstanding 
### 
To the Editor:
In the issue of The Daily for Jan. 8, 1953, appeared
what purported to he an interview with tne in respect
of the proposed congressional investigation of alleged
Communism and Communistic activities in Ameri
can colleges and universities. Any opinions I then
expressed were entirely informal, casual, personal,
and obviously not intended for publication. In fact,
I was entirely unaware that the person in my office
for the purpose of discussing one of my courses was
also conducting an "interview.'' This may or may

not have been my fault. Until 1 have definite in
formation about, the scope of (he congressional pro
gram, my opinion would be of little value and not
worth publishing.

(Editor's note; Reporter RoflF had no intentions of
not making clear to Dr. Uarclay that his comments
were for publication and believed that the pro
fessor understood why lie was being questioned.
The Daily regrets the misunderstanding.)
