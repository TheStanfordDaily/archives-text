## 
### 
The Stanford Braves extended their win skein to seven straight
over the weekend with two wins over their arch rivals the Cali
fornia Blues. Friday night the Indians posted a 63-54 decision
and repeated Saturday afternoon with a 61-54 victory.
Saturday's nip-and-tuck battle was the last for the Braves under

the tutelage of Coach Ed Tucker,
who reports for military service this
morning. George Lynn, one of
Chuck Taylor's assistant grid coach
es, will take over the reins as Brave
basketball coach.
Playing on the Blues' home court
made little difference to the Braves
Friday night as they blasted off to a
20-7 first-quarter' lead, threatening
to hand their opponents a terrible
lashing.
The margin increased to 26 -10
early in tRe second period before
Cal found the range. At this point
the Blues pumped in nine straight
points to trim the lead to 26-19.
Stanford managed to stem the on
rushing tide, leaving the floor with
a 31-25 lead at the intermission.
Unwilling to play dead, the Blues
came back strong in the third stan
za, coming to within one point of
catching the Braves, 42-43, in the
late moments. Paul Johnson and
Sam Morley tallied successive
buckets to momentarily halt the
Bear threat.
Andy Wolfe's Blues quintet made
their final bid with four minutes of
play -remaining in the contest, pull
ing up 54-56 on the strength of some

steady shooting by forward Dave
Schocttler.
Wayne Culberson and Alan Tal
boy combined for five quick points
to ice the game for the Braves. ..
Morley copped high scoring hon
ors in the rough and tumble con
test with 16 points; Culberson fol
lowed with 12.
Saturday's renewal of hostilities,
although a better played game, was
almost a repeat performance with
Stanford leading from start to finish,
but Cal threatening to come from
behind during most of the final pe
riod.
Tucker's stalwarts opened quickly
and were leading 17-11 after the
first ten minutes. The margin was
boosted to 27-20 at half-time.
Stanford had its biggest lead mid
way through the third quarter, 39-
28; but the Blues methodically came
back and finally pulled abreast at
47-47 with seven minutes to go in
the tilt.
Wayne Lockhart hit on a set shot
to put his Brave teammates back
into the lead. Cal fought stubbornly
but was never able to overcome the
deficit.
