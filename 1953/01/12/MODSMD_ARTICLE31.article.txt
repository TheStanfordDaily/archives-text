# Frosh Beat Cubs Twice
## 
### 
Stanford's frosh basketball team
still occupies the victory trail as
California suffered their winning
ways in two tilts last Friday and
Saturday.
The hoopmen went up to Berkeley
Friday afternoon and did away with
the host team, 79-55. Back on the
Farm in the prelim to last Satur
day's varsity game the Papooses
won again, C 35 - 57. The twin wins
boosted the frosh's undefeated streak
to five.
By first-quarter appearances, Fri
day's contest looked like it was going
to be close. Both teams had scored
19 points. But the Papooses busted
up the deadlock in the second quar
ter by hitting the basket for 26
points while allowing the Cubs a
slight nine. The scoring spree halt
ed any Cal chances.
Stanford guard George Selleck
totaled 22 points for the game's high
while teammates Gfinnar Christian
sen and Ron Wagner followed with
12 apiece.
In Saturday's contest the Cubs
improved to the point of scoring a
few more baskets and holding their
opponents to less, as compared to
Friday's score. The Berkeley boys
sprang a quick 11-1 lead on the
Papooses in the beginning of the
first quarter. But the lead was cut
as the Stanford yearlings countered
on five straight points via free
throws. At the first quarter con
clusion the score stood 13-13. Just
as before, Stanford drew away in
the second quarter and the half-time
tally was 34-28 for Stanford. The
closest the Cubs could approach the
lead was by three points in the re
mainder of the game.
Ron Wagner, 'usually overshad
owed by his partner at the Stanford
guard positions, George Selleck,
showed his ability by being the
team's high point man with 13 tal
lies. Selleck scored less than half
the points he mnde in the Friday
game as he got only 10 markers, but
his sharp passes accounted for other
scores.
Coach Dick Clegg's frosh will be
out to keep their undefeated status
intact when they meet Lowell and
George Washington high schools
next weekend.

Friday's score. The Berkeley boys
sprang a quick 11-1 lead on the
Papooses in the beginning of the
first quarter. But the lead was cut
as the Stanford yearlings countered
on five straight points via free
throws. At the first quarter con
clusion the score stood 13-13. Just
as before, Stanford drew away in
the second quarter and the half-time
tally was 34-28 for Stanford. The
closest the Cubs could approach the
lead was by three points in the re
mainder of the game.
Ron Wagner, 'usually overshad
owed by his partner at the Stanford
guard positions, George Selleck,
showed his ability by being the
team's high point man with 13 tal
lies. Selleck scored less than half
the points he mnde in the Friday
game as he got only 10 markers, but
his sharp passes accounted for other
scores.
Coach Dick Clegg's frosh will be
out to keep their undefeated status
intact when they meet Lowell and
George Washington high schools
next weekend.
