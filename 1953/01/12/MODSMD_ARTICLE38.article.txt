With Christmas holidays behind
them, students across the nation re
turned to college classrooms this
week and created some new enroll
ment figures.
Like STANFORD, USC and SAN
JOSE STATE have reported a drop
from last year's numbers. Registra
tion totals to date are: STANFORD,
6,737; USC, 8,807; SAN JOSE. 6,329;
WASHINGTON STATE COLLEGE
has had an increased enrollment.
Registered there at present are 5,081
(among them the Crosby twins,
Gary's brothers, Philip and Dennis).
In typical Florida style, students
at the UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI are
doing things a little out of season.
Panty raids on most campuses had
subsided by last May, but this win

Three participants were expelled
from school and more are being

WASHINGTON Daily:
"University men and women may
now pi e - register for the winter
quarter ski classes. Classes will
meet at noon Fridays on campus
and six Saturdays at tho ASUW ski
area beyond Steven's Pass summit."
The "ski area" was an idea pro
moted by a former UW ski coach,
Buster Campbell. The area features
a three - story lodge, a sheltered
slope that retains snow-fall, and
rope tow facilities. Imagine, spend
ing a weekend on the slopes and
gelling credit (one unit) for it!
At UCLA, Scop, the school's lit
erary-humor mag, has gone the way
of all college mags. Yep, it's been
suspended, for "action detrimental
to the best interests of the univer
sity," the Daily Bruin reported re
cently. The questionable issue re
ceived a flood of complaints on con
tent. Evidently, the most offensive
material was a parody concerning

the $18,000 fund scandal involving
Vice - President - elect Nixon, The
Scop's suspension was the second
in its seven-year history. It was
banned in 1947 and late# reinstated.
At CALIFORNIA, the Campanile
has been conquered! It happened
last month when two Cal Sierra
Club members broke into the tower,
climbed its interior stairs, secured a
rope to the east balustrade, and
made a dangling, 208-foot descent,
(Both were later treated for rope
burns at Cowell Memorial Hospital.)
