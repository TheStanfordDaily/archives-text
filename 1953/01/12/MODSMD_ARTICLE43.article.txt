# EDITH PIAF'S SINGING 'MAGNIFICENT'
## Other San Francisco, Campus Culture Events Listed 
### MARY FRAZER 
Up with the tri-color, and vive
la France; chanteuse Edith Piaf
is at the Curran Theater, and
brinys with her one of the most
passionate, thrilling voices to
be heard anywhere today.
Piaf is unimposing as a stage fig
ure— small, wistful, almost totally
unglamorous — yet her magnificent
interpretation of "French songs, old
Mid ih.jv" is packed witli earthy,
human emotional appeal. She pre
sents the tragic, the sentimental, the
gay, the martial, with equal verve
and feeling. •
Piaf sings with every fiber, then
hows her head, waits for the ap
plause to stop, and begins again.
She is simply Piaf, the spirit of
Paris. Her lack of professional stage
mannerisms, of the bright smile, of
the Hollywood - type prettiness, is
distinctly refreshing.
The voice itself mocks descrip
tion. Low, throaty, with ail enor
mous volume, it is capable of por
traying the most subtle emotional
nuances. The words are French,
but one understands.

Up with the tri-color, and vive
la France; chanteuse Edith Piaf
is at the Curran Theater, and
brinys with her one of the most
passionate, thrilling voices to
be heard anywhere today.
Piaf is unimposing as a stage fig
ure— small, wistful, almost totally
unglamorous — yet her magnificent
interpretation of "French songs, old
Mid ih.jv" is packed witli earthy,
human emotional appeal. She pre
sents the tragic, the sentimental, the
gay, the martial, with equal verve
and feeling. •
Piaf sings with every fiber, then
hows her head, waits for the ap
plause to stop, and begins again.
She is simply Piaf, the spirit of
Paris. Her lack of professional stage
mannerisms, of the bright smile, of
the Hollywood - type prettiness, is
distinctly refreshing.
The voice itself mocks descrip
tion. Low, throaty, with ail enor
mous volume, it is capable of por
traying the most subtle emotional
nuances. The words are French,
but one understands.
With Mile. Piaf is a cast of va
riety entertainers, including singer
Jacques Peals, Jean Sheldon and
bis banjo, and the lie Mattiazzi
dancing dolls. The troupe will be
at (be Curran until Jan. 15.
