# Hershey to Push Draft of College Students
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 (UP).â€”
Draft director Lewis B. Hershey
"undoubtedly" will carry his fight
for tighter draft deferment policies
to the new Republican - steered
Congress, a Selective Service
spokesman said today.
This official said Hershey's first
opportunity probably will come
when the House Armed Services
Committee summons him to tes
tify on legislation extending the
physicians - dentists draft. The
law is due to expire July 1.
Hershey has been warning for

more than a year that State Selec
tive Service Boards are danger
ously near the bottom of the man
power barrel. Only last Friday he
warned that the drafting of fathers
and college students appeared "im
minent. H
His warning was pointed up over
the week end by the disclosure that
New York has started drafting
19-year-old youths to meet its
monthly quota.
A recent United Press survey
showed that nearly all states ex
pected to he drafting 19-year
olds by March. Only one stale,

Florida, thought it could post
pone a 19-year-old draft until
summer.
Hershey and other draft officials
are particularly concerned about
educational and dependency defer
ments and mental and physical
standards set by the armed forces.
Hershey may appeal to Congress to
take action in these fields.
The Selective Service spokesman
noted that draft calls are expected
to average about 50,UU0 a month for
at least the next several months,
and said it was his private opinion
that they may go higher.

The Army has asked for 53,000
draftees in February.
The spokesman said one step to
provide the necessary men might
be to start drafting "post-Korean"
fathers, men whose children have
been born since June, 1950. He said
this could be done through a Presi
dential executive order.
Draft officials are particularly
concerned about college students
who get temporary educational
deferments and then receive still
further deferments by marrying
and having children. Hershey

has marked this field for special
attention.
Hershey has long campaigned for
lower physical and mental stand
ards in the armed services. He in
sists that many men are rejected
who could perform useful tasks in
service or release for battlefield
duty able-bodied men now "chair
borne/"'
In 1951, Congress ordered the
armed services to set physical -
mental standards no higher than
those in effect in 1945. Prodding by
Congress now might result in still
lower standards^
