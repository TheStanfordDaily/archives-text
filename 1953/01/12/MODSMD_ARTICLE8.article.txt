# 'MANY HOLES SEEN'
## House Slates Budget Scrutiny 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 (UP).
—Rep. John Taber said today
his economy-bent House Ap
propriations Committee will
start reviewing President Tru
man's $78,600,000,000 budget
without waiting for suggestions
from the new Eisenhower admin
istration.
He said informal hearings will be
gin immediately after the inaugura
tion, Jan. 20. But he emphasized
that no bills will be drawn until
after President-elect Eisenhower and
his aides have had their say.
The New York Republican said
he already has noted "holes" in
Mr. Truman's budget for the 12
months beginning next July 1 that
might lead to cuts of as much as
$15,000,000,000.
Sen. Stales Bridges (R-N.H.), who
will head the Senate Appropriations
Committee, predicted that the Re
publicans will balance the budget,
and stop "reckless spending."
Sen. Estes Kefauver (I)-Tenn.)
said be also hopes the budget will
be balanced. But be predicted the
(iOP will limi it difficult to cut
Mr. Truman's spending figure. He
noted that 73 percent of it is ear
marked for military or defense
connected projects.
Sen. Frank Carlson (R-Kan.) said
he believes the new Congress will
balance the budget, reduce the na
tional debt, permit the excess profits
ta* to expire June 30 and advance
the date for an 11 percent personal
income tax reduction.
Taber intimated that the biggest
reductions may come in Mr. Tru
man's request for expenditures of
$46,300,000,000 for the defense estab
lishment and $7,000,000,000 for for
eign aid.
The President asked for $78,-
600,000,000 spending in fiscal 1954
and $72,900,000,000 in new appro
priations. Revenues for the year
are expected to be about $(!!),000,-
000,000, so Congress would have to
cut spending by nearly $10,000,-
000,000 to balance the budget.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 (UP).
—Rep. John Taber said today
his economy-bent House Ap
propriations Committee will
start reviewing President Tru
man's $78,600,000,000 budget
without waiting for suggestions
from the new Eisenhower admin
istration.
He said informal hearings will be
gin immediately after the inaugura
tion, Jan. 20. But he emphasized
that no bills will be drawn until
after President-elect Eisenhower and
his aides have had their say.
The New York Republican said
he already has noted "holes" in
Mr. Truman's budget for the 12
months beginning next July 1 that
might lead to cuts of as much as
$15,000,000,000.
Sen. Stales Bridges (R-N.H.), who
will head the Senate Appropriations
Committee, predicted that the Re
publicans will balance the budget,
and stop "reckless spending."
Sen. Estes Kefauver (I)-Tenn.)
said be also hopes the budget will
be balanced. But be predicted the
(iOP will limi it difficult to cut
Mr. Truman's spending figure. He
noted that 73 percent of it is ear
marked for military or defense
connected projects.
Sen. Frank Carlson (R-Kan.) said
he believes the new Congress will
balance the budget, reduce the na
tional debt, permit the excess profits
ta* to expire June 30 and advance
the date for an 11 percent personal
income tax reduction.
Taber intimated that the biggest
reductions may come in Mr. Tru
man's request for expenditures of
$46,300,000,000 for the defense estab
lishment and $7,000,000,000 for for
eign aid.
The President asked for $78,-
600,000,000 spending in fiscal 1954
and $72,900,000,000 in new appro
priations. Revenues for the year
are expected to be about $(!!),000,-
000,000, so Congress would have to
cut spending by nearly $10,000,-
000,000 to balance the budget.
