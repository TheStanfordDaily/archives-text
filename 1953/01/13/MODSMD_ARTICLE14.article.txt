# Row Rush Begins, But 'Etas' And 'Epsilons' Snatch Pledges
## 
### 
Encina Ilall was quiet and tomb-like last night—but along Lower
Row—Wow!
For last night was the first night of fraternity rushing, that wild
round of parties, meals, and open houses.
But it was not the 12 fraternities along Lower How that particu
larly captured the spot-light. The headliners for the evening were
two new Row houses, Eta Beta Pi +

and Psi Epsilon.
The' two new campus houses
made their opening bid for Stanford
recognition and garnered it easily.
In fact, they almost stole the
show from the fraternities.
The fraternities, to he sure, re
ported spectaculu-r response to the
first night of rushing, with most
houses reporting upward to 300
visitors.
Eneina and Toyon sponsors said
that freshmen took oft in droves
last night, estimating that over 75
per cent of the lower classmen par
ticipated in the rush activities.
All rushing chairmen said they
were "well satisfied with the
turn-out.
Upper Row chairmen say they
expect a similar turn-out when
their houses host potential rush
ees tonight. Open houses in the 12
Upper Row fraternities begin at
7:15 and last until 9:15.
But last night it was the two
"new'' houses that sparked the most
comment. For in reality the two
houses were Lathrop and Russell.
The girls from the two houses got
into the rushing act in a big *way,
and both houseu reported they had
pledged several freshmen before
the conclusion of the night's hi-jinx.

Pledge pins in both houses were
gold safety pins.
The Lathrop girls renamed their
house Eta Beta Pi. Dressed in al
luring olf-the-shoulder gowns and
attractive black velvet slack out
fits, they mimicked conventional
fraternity rushing procedure by
showing the boys through the
house (the first floor only) and
by serving champagne (IUO per
cent water).
Girls hit upon the novel stunt
when bewildered freshmen mista
kenly called at the outset of the
evening. The girls, hoping to play
on first - day confusion, quickly
painted signs, proclaiming open
house. They also painted Greek let
ter posters bearing the names of
their newly established "co-educa
tional fraternities."
Club rushing, which got under
way Wednesday, continued to
boom last night. Each of the
seven clubs held an invitational
dinner.
Formal rushing activities end
Jan. 26 when pledge cards will
be signed.
Rushing activities for the Row's
two new clubs ended last night.
They ran out of pledge pins.

two new Row houses, Eta Beta Pi +

and Psi Epsilon.
The' two new campus houses
made their opening bid for Stanford
recognition and garnered it easily.
In fact, they almost stole the
show from the fraternities.
The fraternities, to he sure, re
ported spectaculu-r response to the
first night of rushing, with most
houses reporting upward to 300
visitors.
Eneina and Toyon sponsors said
that freshmen took oft in droves
last night, estimating that over 75
per cent of the lower classmen par
ticipated in the rush activities.
All rushing chairmen said they
were "well satisfied with the
turn-out.
Upper Row chairmen say they
expect a similar turn-out when
their houses host potential rush
ees tonight. Open houses in the 12
Upper Row fraternities begin at
7:15 and last until 9:15.
But last night it was the two
"new'' houses that sparked the most
comment. For in reality the two
houses were Lathrop and Russell.
The girls from the two houses got
into the rushing act in a big *way,
and both houseu reported they had
pledged several freshmen before
the conclusion of the night's hi-jinx.

Pledge pins in both houses were
gold safety pins.
The Lathrop girls renamed their
house Eta Beta Pi. Dressed in al
luring olf-the-shoulder gowns and
attractive black velvet slack out
fits, they mimicked conventional
fraternity rushing procedure by
showing the boys through the
house (the first floor only) and
by serving champagne (IUO per
cent water).
Girls hit upon the novel stunt
when bewildered freshmen mista
kenly called at the outset of the
evening. The girls, hoping to play
on first - day confusion, quickly
painted signs, proclaiming open
house. They also painted Greek let
ter posters bearing the names of
their newly established "co-educa
tional fraternities."
Club rushing, which got under
way Wednesday, continued to
boom last night. Each of the
seven clubs held an invitational
dinner.
Formal rushing activities end
Jan. 26 when pledge cards will
be signed.
Rushing activities for the Row's
two new clubs ended last night.
They ran out of pledge pins.

Encina Ilall was quiet and tomb-like last night—but along Lower
Row—Wow!
For last night was the first night of fraternity rushing, that wild
round of parties, meals, and open houses.
But it was not the 12 fraternities along Lower How that particu
larly captured the spot-light. The headliners for the evening were
two new Row houses, Eta Beta Pi +
