# Einstein Asks Truman For Rosenberg Reprieve

### 
PRINCETON, N.J., Jan. 12 (UP)â€”Dr. Albert Einstein asked Presi
dent Truman today to commute the death sentences of atom spies
Julius and Ethel Rosenbery.
In a one-paragraph letter to the President, dated yesterday, the
famed physicist wrote:
"My conscience compels me to urge you to commute the death

sentences of Julius and Ethel Ro
senberg. This appeal to you is
prompted by the same reasons
which were set forth so convincing
ly by my distinguished colleague,
Harold C. Urey, in his letter of Jan.
5, 1953, to the New York Times."
In that letter, Urey criticized
"grossly unequal" punishment
meted out to the husband and wife
spy team in view of lighter sen
tences handed other members of
the spy ring. Urey said there also
is room for doubt of some of the
government's evidence against the
Rosenbergs.
The U.S. Supreme Court has re
fused to review the case. The Ro
senbergs have appealed to President
Truman to save them by granting
executive clemency.
They have been granted a stay of
execution pending action by the
President. Both are in the death
house at Sing Sing Prison, Ossining,
N.Y,
