# Filibusters—How Can They Be Justified?
## 
### 
Democracy teceived a slap in the face last
week in the Senate.
A proposal to check filibustering came be
fore the floor, ft had been sponsored by a bi
partisan group of Senators and it would have
made it possible to cut off debate with a ma
jority smaller tfio 1 the constitutional two-thirds
now required. Then another bipartisan group
—a coalition ol Republicans and Southern
Democrats — backed up Senate Republican
Leader Robert Taft's proposal to lay aside the
motion indefinitely.
The group which sponsored the anti-hli
buster proposal is also lot Civil Rights legis
lation; the group which deleated the proposal
also opposes Civil Rights laws. This is the
explanation most analysts give, though some
point out that a lew Republicans explained
they favored tightening *i/libustcr curbs with

legislation rather than a rules change.
We do not oppose the anti-filibuster group's
right to try to defeat civil rights legislation—
but we do object to their means.
The filibuster is an insult to the democratic,
constitutional form of government.
Ilow can anyone justify wasting valuable
legislative time with the reading aloud ol the
1340 Census Report or the Washington, D.C.,
phone book?
How can anyone justify any such devious
technique which prevents a proposal from
being put to a free and fair vote?
We fail to see any justification for a filibuster,
ft is an unfair means to reach an end and can
not be excused, no matter how desirable the
end may be. Wc can only hope some Senate
in the near future will contain a less Machia
vellian majority.
