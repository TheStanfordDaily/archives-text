Last year the Vocational Guidance Committee ap
pointed by the A.S.S.U. Ex-Com reluctantly decided
to suspend operations. For a good many years the
previous committees had sought to foster and pro
mote activities which would help students better to
plan their vocational futures. Principal method em-

ployed was the forum-type meet
ing to which successful persons
in the professional and industrial
fields were brought to the cam
pus to speak.
After "Korea" and the adop
tion of compulsory military serv
ice the interest in civilian jobs and
career planning seemed to wane.
The last sizeable Vocational Com
mittee audience was the one at
Cubberly Auditorium, a meeting

at which "opportunities within the armed forces"
were discussed. At the end of the annual series the
committee decided to abandon the forum-type meet
ings until a definite need was evident and expressed
by the students. No spark of interest has since been
manifest.
I believe there is cause for concern regarding
this seeming lack of interest in long-term vocational
planning. There presumably exists an attitude of
"armed forces fatalism" among the men students,
which results in limiting their life plans to the point
of graduation and induction. "From there" they
must think "Uncle Sam will take over. After I get
out I'll worry about the next step."
This type of reasoning was pretty typical of the
inductees of the early "40's." They wore somewhat
justified in their attitudes at that time as no one
could foretell how long "the duration" would last.
Another uncertainty then was the kind of job rrfarket
which would probably prevail when the war was
over. After a deeade of economic depression with

its attending job scarcity, industry was recovering
but the patterns of business activity were not clear.
Many college graduates went into the service after
long fruitless efforts to secure employment in the
fields for which they had been trained.
Today there are many more encouraging factors
in our situation upon which long-term plans may be
made. Granted that, there are many unknownsâ€”the
future has always had that peculiarity. We do know
that under present regulations about 600,000 men
will be "rotated" out of the service this year and
tfcat probably will be true in J955 and 1956. The
term of service is now somewhat definite. We know
a good deal about long-term business and industrial
trends and can estimate future employment condi
tions under anticipated varying conditions.
There are available at Stanford and in neighbor
ing communities many people who have spent years
of study and experience in their particular indus
trial or occupational fields. They could be used as
a rich resource for long-term career planning.
In addition to fact gathering a graduating student
should not overlook the opportunity for employer
contacts in his chosen field before he goes into the
service. Many firms have adopted a policy of em
ploying draft-vulnerable graduates even though their
employment will be short before being called up.
They know that immediately they will lose money,
but that if the more experienced, mature veteran
returns to the company they will have made a good
investment.
Two or three years out of a young person's life
seems long, but in a relatively short time his dis
charge points will have accumulated to the place
where he will begin to think a great deal about bis
work for the next 35 to 40 years. A fellow who
now makes some post-service plans for additional
training or a job, or both, will be better able to
adjust quickly to the situation existing when he is
discharged because intelligent plans will include
alternate courses of action.
Is there at present a need for the Vocational Guid
ance Committee to consider a new student-forum
series -possibly called "Career Strategy for 1056?"
