Stanford heat Cal at its own strong game of offensive rebounding, and
and that was most of the story. Also, the phenomenally high shooting
percentage, wliich was near 50 percent. As a matter of fact, we've never
seen a Stanford team so strong on the boards..
One of the brightest aspects of the game was the development that the
[Xvano terror, George Zaninovich, showed. Previously, "Zeno" had always
:>een an unpolished gem. Last Saturday, he came of age. The 10 points
le scored on his ferocious broad jump lay-ins was only part of the story,
rhe other part was the fact that he swept both offensive and defensive
K>ards and was scrapping for every loose ball.
George, one of the very few six-foot two-inch basketballers in the
•ountry who can dunk a ball, is a weak shot from outside. But as ex-

hoopster Fritz Fenster said to us
last Friday, "If they made Ail-
Americans on driving ability alone,
George would get it."
After the game, Burnett said,
"I've never seen a boy as strong as
George who is also so quick. We on
the coaching staff figured it would
take a few years for George to hit
his peak, and he did tonight."
Another player who put together
the best game of his career was long
limbed Don DeLong, the jump-shot
artist from San Francisco. "Dort," as
his fraternity brothers call him, has
unusually long arms and can flick
the ball out of an opponent's hands
without his suspecting it. It was
DeLong's board work and two
handed swishers that sparked the
Card rally in the late stages of the
game."
0 This week, ifs UCLA. If DeLong
and Zaninovich keep it up, Russ

112 uwler, Dave Epperson, and Don Carlson continue their improvement,
and Hon Tomsic and Olie SuzdaicfT keep up their spectacular ball, the
Cards may take two this week end.

the best game of his career was long
limbed Don DeLong, the jump-shot
artist from San Francisco. "Dort," as
his fraternity brothers call him, has
unusually long arms and can flick
the ball out of an opponent's hands
without his suspecting it. It was
DeLong's board work and two
handed swishers that sparked the
Card rally in the late stages of the
game."

and Zaninovich keep it up, Russ

112 uwler, Dave Epperson, and Don Carlson continue their improvement,
and Hon Tomsic and Olie SuzdaicfT keep up their spectacular ball, the
Cards may take two this week end.

George would get it."
After the game, Burnett said,
"I've never seen a boy as strong as
