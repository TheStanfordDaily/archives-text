# Village 308 Takes Mural Cage Opener
## 
### 
Village 308 opened the 1953 intra
mural cage season last night by
scoring a 25-17 victory over
Brownswood.
The game was a rough and tum
ble affair that saw most of the
scoring done from the foul line. The
Village quintet held a 12-8 half
time advantage.
Brownswood closed the gap to
two points at one point during the
second half with Larry Wright
leading the attack.
John Francis retaliated with two
successive shots for the Villagers to
move them into a more comfortable
lead.
Ken Townsend and Francis shared
the scoring honors for the winners
with seven points apiece. Bruce
Wadman paced Brownswood with
six markers.
