# 'Invasion U.S.A.' Theme III-Treated, Critic Avers
## 
### MARY FRAZER 
Movies are better than ever? "Invasion U.5.A.," billed this week
at the Park, does little to prove the point.
The film is supposedly the chronicle of a "foreign" invasion of
the United States. Its heavily propagandized "message" is that
such a thing can happen here; only the most mesmerized of us

would disagree. For tackling this
controversial subject and for at
tempting to influence public opin
ion on a vital issue, the producer is
to be congratulated.
Audience reaction to the film
indicates that the producer's in
tent is far from realized. From the
audience's collective breast comes
a reaction not unlike that to the
Sunday Evening Mem Aud serials.
How does the movie fail?
Badly constructed scale model

battle scenes are
interpolated with
familiar World
War II newsreels
of the London
blitz and Pacific
Theater cam
paigns with little

regard for continuity or actual film
color. Improbable plot situations
mock the credibility of the invasion
to a remarkable degree.
Sketchy characters, most of them
stock Hollywood personalities, con
tribute little toward putting the in
vasion's effects on a real, personal
basis. The back-slapping Rotarian,
the long-winded Congressman, the
usual decorative blondeâ€”all are on
hand to present complacent-sound
ing small talk before the invasion
and platitudes after
ward.
What they urge in the way of
defense measures is thoroughly
admirable, hut the third - grade
manner in which they spew forth
poster slogans is quite offensive.
Writ large, the major difficulty of
"Invasion U.S.A." ig not so much
the technical and dramatic flaws as
the fact that the film tries to be both
personal and documentary at once.
Such a theme, if it is to carry a real
Sunday punch, should move on
either the personal (e.g., individual,
family, or town) basis, or be a com
pletely documentary clean sweep. A
hash of both lessens the impact of
either.

In short, "fnvasion U.S.A." is
worth the price if one doesn't mind
seeing a worthwhile theme b a dly
mangled. Le|. us hope for a speedy
and more competent treatment, one
which will invoke positive action
rather than comic-book amusement.
