# Remodeled Lag Boathouse May Open This Quarter
## 
### R.G. MANSFIELD 
Renovation of the Lake Lagunita boathouse is being completed
in preparation for the opening of the lake to boaters and swimmers
this spring. ASSU Student Manager Steve Horn estimates that
the lake will not be opened until the end of the winter cfuarter
at least.
Plans for renovating the boathouse were initiated last spring

by Stan Sheinbaum, summer stu-'
dent manager, and Horn. Shein
baum drew up contracts and took
bids, letting the contract to Aro and
Okerrnan, contractors, of Palo Alto,
on Oct. 9.
Aro and Okerman finished the
greater part of the planned repairs
by Oct. 20. These repairs included
complete replanking of all the decks
in the boathouse, cementing of some
walks, and complete rebuilding of
the left float. The left float rebuild
ing included replacing and retarring
of 08 drums.
Work remaining to be done on
the boathouse before this year's
opening includes preservative paint
ing. This job will probably be given
<to this year's pledge class of Alpha

Phi Omega, national service organi
zation. The entire boathouse will
be repainted later in tin* year.
At the present time, lour life
guards live at the boathouse, but
their activities are chiefly keeping
people, especially children, away
from the boggy edges of the lake.
A child was drowned in tin- kike
shortly after it was officially closed
last summer, and lifeguards are tak
ing names and warning parents of
children who persist in playing near
the lake this winter.
Expense for boathouse repairs will
total nearly $3,500. Since the boat
house fund comes chiefly from such
small income sources as canoe fees,
a loan of $2,000 from ASSU was
needed before repairs could be be
gun.
