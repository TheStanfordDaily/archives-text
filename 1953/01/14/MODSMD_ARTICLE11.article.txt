### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 (UP) —The Senate voted overwhelm
ingly today to oust rebel Sen. Wayne Morse from the Senate
Armed Services Committee in what amounted to a direct rebuff
for his support of Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson for the Presidency.
After the vote, in which only seven Senators rallied to the sup-

port of the Oregon independent,
Morse abandoned a companion fight
to retain his seat on the Senate La
bor Committee. The action left him
with only two minor committee
posts, Public Works and District of
Columbia.
The Senate voted 81 to 7 against
seating Morse on the Armed Serv
ices Committee and then, by voice
vote, approved Labor Committee as
signments drawn up by the Senate
GOP caucus which excluded Morse.
The Senate alsQ formally ap
proved the caucus' decision to allot
vacancies on the Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee to Senate Repub
lican Leader Robert A. Tait (O),
and Sens. William F. Knowland
(Calif.), William Langer (N. 1).), and
Homer Ferguson (Mich.).
Morse, who deserted Eisenhower
backers to campaign for Stevenson
and now regards himself as an in
dependent, had said he did not want
his committee assignments to come
from either the GOP or Democratic
caucuses.
When the Republicans took him
at his word, Morse carried his fight
to the Senate floor, charging that he
had been the victim of "terroristic"
and "punitive" measures.
