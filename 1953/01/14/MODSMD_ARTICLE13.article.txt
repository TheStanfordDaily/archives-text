# 300 Rushees Visit Upper Row Houses
## 
### 
The fraternity rushing spotlight
shifted to the Upper Row last night,
where each of the twelve Upper Row
houses reported a good turnout of
freshmen and other prospective
rushees.
Rushing chairmen of the various
houses noted about 300 visitors dur
ing the two hours of open house.
Tonight, the beam of rushing activ
ity returns to the Lower Row where
the other twelve fraternities will
host rushees. The Lower Row kicked
off fraternity rushing Monday.
Officials of the Inter-Fraternity
Council expect the fraternities to
pledge about 400 men this year. The
seven clubs expect to pledge about
100.
The clubs are planning a series of
invitational parties and dinners. Club
rushing got under way a week ago.
Formal rushing will end Jan. 26,
when pledge cards will be signed.
Fraternities will begin handing out
pledge pins Friday night when the
"no holds barred" aspect of rushing
begins. Then fraternity men will be
able to visit rushees at the freshmen
dorms.
Rushing chairmen of both Lower
and Upper Row houses report the
turnout "much better" this year.
Several chairmen said the turnout
this year was "100 percent" better
than last year.
Club rushing chairmen echoed the
same opinion. They said open houses
held by the clubs were "wonderfully
successful."
