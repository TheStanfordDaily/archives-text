## Pair Will Leave At End of Month 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 13 (UP) —
President-elect Dwight D. Eisen
hower today ordered John Fos
ter Dulles, Secretary of State
designate, and Harold FJ. Stas
sen, Mutual Security Director
designate, to go to Europe soon
to study the U.S. role in NATO
and the Economic Assistance
Program.
Dulles and Stassen were to leave
at the end of this month for the
10-day trip to gather information
on political trends there "in relation
to United States participation in the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and in the Economic Assistance Pro
gram.
The decision to send the new
administration's two top foreign
policy officials to Europe for a
personal, on-the-spot survey, par
ticularly of political conditions,
was made during the second full
scale meeting of Eisenhower, his
cabinet, and other key members
of his high command.
Dulles, in a press conference after
the meeting broke up, said details
of his trip were being worked out.
He said he would confine his Euro
pean vLsit to countries west of the
Iron Curtain.
This was the first announcement
of any concrete action to come from
the meeting, called by Eisenhower
to chart his administration's course
in both foreign and domestic affairs.
The question was raised wheth
er the trift had any connection
with Soviet Premier Josef Stalin's
Christmas Eve statement that he
would be willing to meet with
Eisenhower. Press Secretary Hag
erty said this was not a factor in
the trip.
He said it did not stem either from
recent talks Eisenhower had here
with Britain's Prime Minister Win
ston Churchill.
