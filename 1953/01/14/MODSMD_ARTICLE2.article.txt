# Kremlin Purge May Equal Bloody Days of 'Thirties
## 
### 
MOSCOW, Jan. 13 (UP) — A
great Russian purge along the
lines of that of 1934 38 appeared
to be shaping up tonight after
the arrest of nine Kremlin doc
tors, six of them Jews, accused
of plotting to kill the nation's top
military leaders.
The Soviets were expected to
stage a quick public trial of the
doctors — and with them Zionism
and a Jewish relief organization—
accused of spying and murdering
Soviet leaders for the U.S. Intelli
gence Service.
Observers of Soviet affairs sus
pected this might mark the start
of u far-reaching purge of ail lev
els of Soviet society. In the ':s(t's

Andrei Vishinsky, then chief
prosecutor and now Soviet foreign
minister, sent Trotskyites, Bu
kharinists, and other deviationists
before firing squads, and exiled
thousands of lesser figures to Si
beria.
The doctors were charged with
subverting public health, under
mining the Soviet defense, and kill
ing or setting up the deaths of An
drei A. Zhdanov in 1948 and Alex
ander S. Shcherbakov in 1945. Both
were members of the Politburo and
top-level Soviet leaders.
All nine of the now arrested
doctors were connected with the
Kremlin's own hospital, where top
Soviet leaders receive treatment.
One was Prof. P. 1. Egorov, "head
of the medical sanitary services

of the Kremlin"—that is to say,
the head of the group of doctors
who look after Stalin's health.
The names of most of the accused
sounded definitely of Jewish origin.
They were Prof. M. S. Vovsi,
therapeutist; Prof. V. E. Vinogradov,
therapeutist; Prof. M. B. Kogan,

otolaryngologist; Prof. Y. G. Etin
ger, therapeutist; Prof. A. M.
Grinshtein, neuropathologist; and G.
I. Mayorov, therapeutist.
The 1930's trial began after the
killing of S. M. Kirov, Josef Stalin's
lieutenant in Leningrad. One trial
followed another for nearly four
years. Most of the "republics" of
the Soviet Union lost their premiers
or presidents or both.

The 1930's trial began after the
killing of S. M. Kirov, Josef Stalin's
lieutenant in Leningrad. One trial
followed another for nearly four
years. Most of the "republics" of
the Soviet Union lost their premiers

MOSCOW, Jan. 13 (UP) — A
great Russian purge along the
lines of that of 1934 38 appeared
to be shaping up tonight after
the arrest of nine Kremlin doc
tors, six of them Jews, accused
of plotting to kill the nation's top
military leaders.
The Soviets were expected to
stage a quick public trial of the
doctors — and with them Zionism
and a Jewish relief organization—
accused of spying and murdering
Soviet leaders for the U.S. Intelli
gence Service.
Observers of Soviet affairs sus
pected this might mark the start
of u far-reaching purge of ail lev
els of Soviet society. In the ':s(t's

Andrei Vishinsky, then chief
prosecutor and now Soviet foreign
minister, sent Trotskyites, Bu
kharinists, and other deviationists
before firing squads, and exiled
thousands of lesser figures to Si
beria.
The doctors were charged with
subverting public health, under
mining the Soviet defense, and kill
ing or setting up the deaths of An
drei A. Zhdanov in 1948 and Alex
ander S. Shcherbakov in 1945. Both
were members of the Politburo and
top-level Soviet leaders.
All nine of the now arrested
doctors were connected with the
Kremlin's own hospital, where top
Soviet leaders receive treatment.
One was Prof. P. 1. Egorov, "head
of the medical sanitary services

of the Kremlin"—that is to say,
the head of the group of doctors
who look after Stalin's health.
The names of most of the accused
sounded definitely of Jewish origin.
They were Prof. M. S. Vovsi,
