## Taber Says No Increase 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 (UP) —
Chairman John Taber of the House
Appropriations Committee predicted
today that the Republican 83rd Con
gress will refuse to vote any new
foreign aid funds this year.
The economy-minded New York
Republican said the Mutual Secu
rity Administration has enough
funds left over from past years to
permit cancellation of President
Truman's entire request for $7,600,-
000.000 in new foreign aid.
Taber, a leading House economy
advocate, predicted President-elect
Eisenhower himself may strike this
item from the budget, and if he
doesn't Congress will.
Asked if Congress would refuse
the funds even if Eisenhower asked
for them, Taber said, "I wouldn't
see how we could do anything else,
because there isn't any case (for
•new funds)."
