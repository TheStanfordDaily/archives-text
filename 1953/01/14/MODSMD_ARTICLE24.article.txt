# Butt Discusses New Aspect Of Dickens' Manuscripts
## 
### GLORIA BRECKENRIDGE 
A new aspect of Charles Dickens as an author was presented
last night by U.C.L A. Professor John E. Butt in his Tuesday Eve
ning Series lecture.
"Many of Dickens' most popular novels—'Domby and Son,'
'Pickwick Papers,' 'David Copperfield,' and others—were first

published in serial form," Professor
Butt told his audience,
"Pickwick Papers" was published
in 19 monthly issues. These were
thin paper-bound editions of 32
pages, which sold for about 20 shil
lings.
"Dickens would write about
three chapters of a novel at the
beginning of a month for publica
tion the following month," Profes
sor Butt went on. Many times
Dickens would be only a few chap
ters ahead of his eager readers.
Piofessor Butt had several slides
showing samples of-Dickens' manu
scripts. He wrote in an extremely
fine and distinctive handwriting
which necessitated a special team of
printers to print his work each
month.
Professor Butt placed little impor
tance on the theory that Dickens had
a master plan for his novels. He had
a predetermined plot and would make
notations on specific actions of his
characters, but much of his writing
was done from month to month, Pro
fessor Butt said.
This serial publication form. Pro
fessor Butt feels, is responsible for
one of Dickens' most renowned
talent as a novelist—his vivid and
intricate descriptions of his char
acters.
"Dickens had to describe his char
acters in great detail," Professor Butt
concluded, "so that when one of them
appeared in a chapter two or three
months later, the reader would in
stantly recognize them."
