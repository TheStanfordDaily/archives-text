# Change the McCarran Act

". . . Give me your tired, your poor,
"Your huddled masses yearning to breathe
free,
"The wretched refuse of your teaming shore.
"Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed
to me.
"I lift my lamp beside the golden door."
So reads the inscription on the Statue of
Liberty. Many a foreigner must have laughed
as he read this—especially since the late 1920'5,
when the U.S. Congress closed the golden door
pretty tightly with immigration laws.
The laws were Irankiy based on the prem
ise that some races were superior to others.
The quotes openly favored Northern Europe,
discriminated against Southern and Eastern
Europeans, and flatly banned Orientals.
In spite of much pressure from religious,
scientific, and other groups, no new immigra
tion legislation has been passed which would
divide up the unused quotas of such countries
as England and provide for more equitable
quotas for other countries.
The McCarran Walter Immigration and Na
tionalities Act, passed last fall, helped a little
in that it allotted small quotas to some Orien
tals. But on the whole it was based 011 the same
racial theories as the legislation of the 1920'5.
Many people have lavored the McCarran
Act because it makes it hard tor Communists
and members of other subversive groups to
enter the country. But even many of these
provisions have proved impractical.
As Time magazine reported last fall, there

strictions against giving a visa to anyone who
is suspected of being a poor security risk has
made it impossible for the United States to hold
any kind of international scientific conference.
Scientists, known to be sincerely anti-Commu
nist, have been denied visas merely becausc
they belonged to an organization which had
some Communist members.
As one editorial writer put it, it is fine to
have a screen to prevent foreign agents from
entering the country to do harm against the
government . . . but it is also possible to have
one with a mesh so fine that it screens out
people we want and need. For our own secur
ity and advancement, we cannot have an Iron
Curtain against scientists from other countries.
Wc grant the need lor restrictions on peo
ple entering this country . . cither to visit
or to stay. Wc agree that regulations must
be set up concerning the number of immi
grants, their literacy, their character, their
ability to support themselves and so lorth.
But wc hate to see the United States made
to look hypocritical before the rest of the world
by immigration legislation based on racial
prejudice, and we hate to sec her hurt herself
by excluding people whom this country needs.
The United States definitely needs some
clear, comprehensive legislation on immigra
tion. It seems to us that it would be an excel
lent undertaking for the new Congress to de
vclop legislation that would meet our needs
more fairly and more practically than the Mc-
Carran Act.

The McCarran Walter Immigration and Na
tionalities Act, passed last fall, helped a little
in that it allotted small quotas to some Orien
tals. But on the whole it was based 011 the same
racial theories as the legislation of the 1920'5.
Many people have lavored the McCarran
Act because it makes it hard tor Communists
and members of other subversive groups to
enter the country. But even many of these
provisions have proved impractical.
As Time magazine reported last fall, there

strictions against giving a visa to anyone who
is suspected of being a poor security risk has
made it impossible for the United States to hold
any kind of international scientific conference.
Scientists, known to be sincerely anti-Commu
nist, have been denied visas merely becausc
they belonged to an organization which had
some Communist members.
As one editorial writer put it, it is fine to
have a screen to prevent foreign agents from
entering the country to do harm against the
government . . . but it is also possible to have
one with a mesh so fine that it screens out
people we want and need. For our own secur
ity and advancement, we cannot have an Iron
Curtain against scientists from other countries.
Wc grant the need lor restrictions on peo
ple entering this country . . cither to visit
or to stay. Wc agree that regulations must
be set up concerning the number of immi
grants, their literacy, their character, their
ability to support themselves and so lorth.
But wc hate to see the United States made
to look hypocritical before the rest of the world
by immigration legislation based on racial
prejudice, and we hate to sec her hurt herself
by excluding people whom this country needs.
The United States definitely needs some
clear, comprehensive legislation on immigra
tion. It seems to us that it would be an excel
lent undertaking for the new Congress to de
vclop legislation that would meet our needs
more fairly and more practically than the Mc-
Carran Act.
". . . Give me your tired, your poor,
"Your huddled masses yearning to breathe
free,
"The wretched refuse of your teaming shore.
"Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed
to me.
"I lift my lamp beside the golden door."
So reads the inscription on the Statue of
Liberty. Many a foreigner must have laughed
as he read this—especially since the late 1920'5,
when the U.S. Congress closed the golden door
pretty tightly with immigration laws.
The laws were Irankiy based on the prem
ise that some races were superior to others.
The quotes openly favored Northern Europe,
discriminated against Southern and Eastern
Europeans, and flatly banned Orientals.
In spite of much pressure from religious,
scientific, and other groups, no new immigra
tion legislation has been passed which would
divide up the unused quotas of such countries
as England and provide for more equitable
quotas for other countries.
