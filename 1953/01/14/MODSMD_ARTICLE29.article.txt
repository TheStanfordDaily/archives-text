### PETE GROTHE 
WEDNESDAY MORNING JOTTINGS
Gridder-basketballer-piano player Sam Motley is
a quick man with the words. While the jayvee hoop
sters were having dinner in a Berkeley hamburger
joint, Morley quipped to the counterman:
"I don't know what kind of meat this is, but there's

a man outside with a saddle, and
he's crying."

CAMPUS TRAGEDY. Harri
son was a conscientious student.
Harrison wanted to Ret an "A" in
international Trade, which is
about as easy as trying to find an
introvert on Rani's Hearl.
Harrison studied hard all last
quarter to get his "A." When dead
week and finals came, it was guts

ball for Harrison. He studied—but I mean really
studied. He missed meals, averaged about three hours
of sleep a night, gouged himself with No-Doz and
coffee and spent hour after hour, day after day book
ing down to get his "A."
Then the day of the final came and Harrison knew
the material down to the last sub-footnote. Rut there
was a hitch. Harrison was a wreck. His white lips
were quivering, his knees were shaking, his head was
ringing, and his eyes looked like the California high
way system in technicolor.
Harrison had studied himself into a fit of exhaus
tion. He saw his prof, spieled off his story of woe,
and took an incomplete in the course.
There must be a moral here somewhere.

AND THE NEXT COURSE . . . Joe Long, a tal
ented linebacker on Chuck Taylor's football squad,
who suffers the singular misfortune of beinq my room
mate, ranks as the campus's most unsuccessful bus
boy.
Last Saturday, Joe was engaged as a hasher at
the Palo Alto Elks' Club plush annual banquet. Joe
noticed that all the waiters were carrying their trays
on one hand over the shoulder.
"It's a cinch; I can do the same thing," allowed .loc
as the chef placed six plates with massive rare steaks
swimming in gravy, peas, and shoestring potatoes
on his tray.
To get. to his particular table, Joe had to cross the
dance floor, and it happened that numerous ladies and
gentlemen were doing the rumba. Joe nimbly dodged
the dancers for the greater part of his trek across the
floor. Rut just before he got to his table, a couple
unbalanced him, and it was "bombs away!" as one
plate after another shelled off the tray. What made
the situation doubly unfortunate was that, there was
a man wearing an expensive light blue suit under
the onslaught of plates. Each of the six plates cuffed
him on the forehead and knocked him to the floor.
A trickle of blood that came from his forehead
couldn't he distinguished from the oozings of the
three rare steaks that lay on his chest and stomach.
Gravied peas trickled down his vest, and shoe
string potatoes lay all over the place.
The bug-eyed head waiter gave Joe a bowl and
ordered him to pick up all the peas. A cameraman
would have had a field day taking shots of Joe crawl
ing between dance couples and under tables to pick up
squishy peas.
After Joe had recovered the peas, he returned to
the victim, who was just, regaining his senses, and
tried to figure out whatincll to say. He thought a
minute and then came out with:
"And what will you have for dessert?"

CAMPUS TRAGEDY. Harri

Harrison wanted to Ret an "A" in
international Trade, which is
about as easy as trying to find an
introvert on Rani's Hearl.
Harrison studied hard all last
quarter to get his "A." When dead
week and finals came, it was guts

ball for Harrison. He studied—but I mean really
studied. He missed meals, averaged about three hours
of sleep a night, gouged himself with No-Doz and
coffee and spent hour after hour, day after day book
ing down to get his "A."
Then the day of the final came and Harrison knew
the material down to the last sub-footnote. Rut there
was a hitch. Harrison was a wreck. His white lips
were quivering, his knees were shaking, his head was
ringing, and his eyes looked like the California high
way system in technicolor.
Harrison had studied himself into a fit of exhaus
tion. He saw his prof, spieled off his story of woe,
and took an incomplete in the course.
There must be a moral here somewhere.

the dancers for the greater part of his trek across the
floor. Rut just before he got to his table, a couple
unbalanced him, and it was "bombs away!" as one
plate after another shelled off the tray. What made
the situation doubly unfortunate was that, there was
a man wearing an expensive light blue suit under

him on the forehead and knocked him to the floor.
