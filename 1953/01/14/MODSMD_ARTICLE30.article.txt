# CAMPUS OPINION
## Before Investigations Begin 
### 
To the Editor:
In the coming investigations of colleges and college
profes oi bv Senatoi McCarthy. there is a chance
that many people will have their reputations and jobs
jeopardized this has happened before and will hap
pen again unless public opinion can force a change
in the methods of these investigations. Now is the
time for this change.
The colleges and universities of this country enjoy
greater respect from the public than they ever have
before. They are in a position to be trusted and to
have their opinions accepted by the majority of the
population of this country, if these opinions are well

founded. Granted the foregoing, the schools are in a
position to shape public opinion.
Now is the time for the universities of the country
to assert themselves and do the country a great service.
By announcing before the investigations begin, that
they will take no action against any of the persons
investigated, until positive proof is afforded, they may
be able to stop such "trials by opinion."
If the schools would follow the above plan, I believe
that they could bring back the old theory that, a man
is innocent until proven guilty. What is more impor
tant, the accused would suffer no loss of social or
financial prestige unless proven guilty.
