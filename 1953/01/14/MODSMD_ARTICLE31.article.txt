# 'Peaceful' Cruise Snagged by Whales
## 
### DICK MANSFIELD 
Except for the time he and
other swimmers wore pursued
by whales in mid Pacific, Martin
Vitousek spent a peaceful sum
mer. All he did was sail 7,000
miles around the Pacific, touch
ing at the Hawaiian Islands and
Sitka, Alaska.
Vitousek. of tlio Stanford applied
mathematics staff, lias a taste for
"bic projects." Shortly after World
War 11, he and lii.s wife toured the
country in a surplus airplane, seeing
3(> states from the air. Then, last
June, the Vitouselcs and three
friends left San Francisco on Vitou
sek's gaff-rigged schooner "Fiesta"
for a summer of "atrictly for pleas
ure" cruising.
The "Fiesta" new had (lie ben
efit of a steady breeze and used
sail Irom San Francisco (n Ha
waii and on (n within half a (lay's
cruise of Sitka, where Vitousek
first used the "Fiesta's" auxiliary
engine.
The ship is comfortably fitted

for such a trip, having three tiled
heads, (wo of them with showers,
a dep freeze and refrigerator, a
radio, and a 1,100 - gallon fresh
water tank.
The trip's peace was disturbed at
one point when the group went
swimming and was chased back
aboard by whales. But except for
some rough weather off Washington
and Oregon on the way home, Vi
tousek says the trip was "pleasant
but uneventful."
The Vitouseks live aboard the
"Fiesta," which is moored near
Redwood City during the school
year. The money which would nor
mally go for house rent goes instead
to pay off loans on the "Fiesta,"
which Vitousek bought, in f.os An
geles in 1951. The Vitouseks spend
most of their spare time keeping
the boat in trim.
Vitousek matriculated af Stan
ford in f!)i:», am! has "been here,
on and ofT, ever since." During
the war he worked for the Navy
in radar research, and he is cur
rently working on a Navy hydro
dynamics project. lie has been a
frcclance photographer and radio

engineer and lias worked with
atidio-cleelronies, in addition to
iiis interests in (lying and sailing.
A native Hawaiian, lie has been
"in and around water all my life."
J lis wife Beatrice, who is on the
staff of the Electronics Research
Department here, is not an experi
enced sailor, but is learning fast.
The couple is planning a cruise
around the world "as soon as time
and means permit," and a "big proj
ect" in the near future, a trip to the
Arctic.
ViUjusek would like to add writ
ing to his other interests. He plans
to write an article on the cruise for
a national magazine, illustrating it
with his own photographs.
