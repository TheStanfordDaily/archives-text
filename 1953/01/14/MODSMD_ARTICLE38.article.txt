# PRO AND CAHN
## On Basketball and Things 
### 
Tito flame was lit"last Saturday night under the Stanford cagers. How
long that flame will burn is something worth considering. Saturday the
cagers gave the impression that they were a good ball club, a club that
wanted to win. Basically Stanford has not the guns to be a top-class team.
They might be next year when the only loss is George Zaninovich, the
hardest rebounder on the court. But this year Bob Burnett has turned in
a fine coaching job with average ball players.
Before Saturday there was doubt in some quarters whether the team
was hustling and playing even to its limited potential. Saturday they gave
it their all and played a whale of a ball game; they also did against LaSalle.
They can do it again if they put their hearts to it. Granted they had
an unusually fine shooting percentage Saturday, but being hot from the
floor doesn't account for the over-all play: the excellent rebounding, the
ball hawking, the defensive play, and the general team spirit and hustle.
They have proven themselves capable of these. A letdown in these depait
■ "v-nts is not excusable, though an off night in shooting, which at times
hits every club, is just one of those tilings and pardonable.
And while on the subject of basketball, it is strange to find that UCLA,
the team that invades the Pavilion this week end, was early this year
regarded as the class of the Southern Division. Now they will be fighting
with Stanford to get out of the cellar. It's USC, forecasted to be a dormat,
which is tied with California, and it should be interesting when the two
clubs collide this week end. In fact, the whole race may prove quite inter
r ting from here in out.
This morning we wish to pass our very best along to Stanford's own
Eddie Tucker, a fine athlete and gentleman. Ed left last Sunday to serve
a hitch with Uncle Sam. He deserves only the best. Ed was coaching
the Junior Varsity and had done an admirable job. His place will be
taken by assistant football coach George Lynn; wonder how the pass
defense will be?
A slightly perturbing (but if you look at it in the right vane, amusing)
uident occurred at the Friday afternoon frosh game at Berkeley last
week.
Frosli Almost Lost Tlieir Pants
The Frosh bussed up to the Cal campus together with the Junior Var
sity who were to play the Cal Blues in the 6 o'clock prelim. But lo and
behold, when the yearlings went to suit up for the 4 o clock game the
v liforms were not to be found. A search proved futile. A phone call back
to Stanford was to no avail as game tir|ie was rapidly approaching and no
planes make the trip between here and the men's gym at Berkeley.
Being faced with the not-to-pleasant prospect of being caught with
their pants down, the Frosh, under the coaching of Dick Clegg, turned to
the Braves for aid. And the Braves, who carry their suits in individual
bags which arc not left to the whims and human mistakes of managers,
were more than happy to oblige. But alas! they only had eight uniforms,
t.id the Frosh number a great deal* more than that. Clegg suited up his
eight top men, but as the Papooses drew away it was a common sight to
see a pair of uniformed players going off toward the dressing room fol
lowed by two lads in street clothes. And moments later the quarter re
turned with exchanged attire, sometimes the uniforms not fitting as well
as they might.
And through the course of the early evening, as the score widened
Clegg substituted freely and the boys changed often.
As humorous as it was, it still points to a certain lack of inefficiency in
the athletic setup. And though this incident was the direct result of a
mistake down through the ranks of the basketball managers, numerous
times in the past equipment has been stolen, misplaced or lost because
of the Athletic Department's refusal to send the necessary number of
managers on trips. This places added burden and undo strain on the man
ager that docs accompany the team as well as the trainer.
And the department's answer? the cost of stolen and lost equipment has
nut approached the cost that is involved in sending that extra manager.
The plan is no doubt sound, as it saves that precious green stuff; but
because the Athletic Department refuses to send that extra manager, blame
for lost and stolen equipment should not be placed on overworked man
agers when the team Is on the road.
Speaking of the Frosh—and somewhere along the way we were —they
have a fine club, led by George Sellik and another boy who really has the
F"*e, Ron Wagner. Dick Clegg has done a fine job to date, but we must
caution that this Friday the Frosh will be tested by the strongest high
school quintet of the area, Lowell of San Francisco.
Lowell is the school that has given Don Carlson to Stanford and Ken
Flower to USC. We might be prejudiced because we went there ourself,
but this year's Lowell team is being boomed as better than the one which
was the only high school team to beat the Stanford Frosh in 1!)4K when
Jim Ramstead and Jim Walsh were starting out. And to be better than
'hat team, Lowell's personnel must be better than Ken Flower, Don
Carlson, Bill Stephenson, Fritz Fenstcr and a rebel who played at Cal.

A slightly perturbing (but if you look at it in the right vane, amusing)
uident occurred at the Friday afternoon frosh game at Berkeley last
week.
Frosli Almost Lost Tlieir Pants
The Frosh bussed up to the Cal campus together with the Junior Var
sity who were to play the Cal Blues in the 6 o'clock prelim. But lo and
behold, when the yearlings went to suit up for the 4 o clock game the
v liforms were not to be found. A search proved futile. A phone call back
to Stanford was to no avail as game tir|ie was rapidly approaching and no
planes make the trip between here and the men's gym at Berkeley.
Being faced with the not-to-pleasant prospect of being caught with
their pants down, the Frosh, under the coaching of Dick Clegg, turned to
the Braves for aid. And the Braves, who carry their suits in individual
bags which arc not left to the whims and human mistakes of managers,
were more than happy to oblige. But alas! they only had eight uniforms,
t.id the Frosh number a great deal* more than that. Clegg suited up his
eight top men, but as the Papooses drew away it was a common sight to
see a pair of uniformed players going off toward the dressing room fol
lowed by two lads in street clothes. And moments later the quarter re
turned with exchanged attire, sometimes the uniforms not fitting as well
as they might.
And through the course of the early evening, as the score widened
Clegg substituted freely and the boys changed often.
As humorous as it was, it still points to a certain lack of inefficiency in
the athletic setup. And though this incident was the direct result of a
mistake down through the ranks of the basketball managers, numerous
times in the past equipment has been stolen, misplaced or lost because
of the Athletic Department's refusal to send the necessary number of
managers on trips. This places added burden and undo strain on the man
ager that docs accompany the team as well as the trainer.
And the department's answer? the cost of stolen and lost equipment has
nut approached the cost that is involved in sending that extra manager.
The plan is no doubt sound, as it saves that precious green stuff; but
because the Athletic Department refuses to send that extra manager, blame
for lost and stolen equipment should not be placed on overworked man
agers when the team Is on the road.
Speaking of the Frosh—and somewhere along the way we were —they
have a fine club, led by George Sellik and another boy who really has the
F"*e, Ron Wagner. Dick Clegg has done a fine job to date, but we must
caution that this Friday the Frosh will be tested by the strongest high
school quintet of the area, Lowell of San Francisco.
Lowell is the school that has given Don Carlson to Stanford and Ken
Flower to USC. We might be prejudiced because we went there ourself,
but this year's Lowell team is being boomed as better than the one which
was the only high school team to beat the Stanford Frosh in 1!)4K when
Jim Ramstead and Jim Walsh were starting out. And to be better than
'hat team, Lowell's personnel must be better than Ken Flower, Don
Carlson, Bill Stephenson, Fritz Fenstcr and a rebel who played at Cal.
Tito flame was lit"last Saturday night under the Stanford cagers. How
long that flame will burn is something worth considering. Saturday the
cagers gave the impression that they were a good ball club, a club that
wanted to win. Basically Stanford has not the guns to be a top-class team.
They might be next year when the only loss is George Zaninovich, the
hardest rebounder on the court. But this year Bob Burnett has turned in
a fine coaching job with average ball players.
Before Saturday there was doubt in some quarters whether the team
was hustling and playing even to its limited potential. Saturday they gave
it their all and played a whale of a ball game; they also did against LaSalle.
They can do it again if they put their hearts to it. Granted they had
an unusually fine shooting percentage Saturday, but being hot from the
floor doesn't account for the over-all play: the excellent rebounding, the
ball hawking, the defensive play, and the general team spirit and hustle.
They have proven themselves capable of these. A letdown in these depait
■ "v-nts is not excusable, though an off night in shooting, which at times
hits every club, is just one of those tilings and pardonable.
And while on the subject of basketball, it is strange to find that UCLA,
the team that invades the Pavilion this week end, was early this year
regarded as the class of the Southern Division. Now they will be fighting
with Stanford to get out of the cellar. It's USC, forecasted to be a dormat,
which is tied with California, and it should be interesting when the two
clubs collide this week end. In fact, the whole race may prove quite inter
r ting from here in out.
This morning we wish to pass our very best along to Stanford's own
Eddie Tucker, a fine athlete and gentleman. Ed left last Sunday to serve
a hitch with Uncle Sam. He deserves only the best. Ed was coaching
the Junior Varsity and had done an admirable job. His place will be
taken by assistant football coach George Lynn; wonder how the pass
defense will be?

nut approached the cost that is involved in sending that extra manager.
The plan is no doubt sound, as it saves that precious green stuff; but
because the Athletic Department refuses to send that extra manager, blame
for lost and stolen equipment should not be placed on overworked man
agers when the team Is on the road.
Speaking of the Frosh—and somewhere along the way we were —they
have a fine club, led by George Sellik and another boy who really has the
F"*e, Ron Wagner. Dick Clegg has done a fine job to date, but we must
caution that this Friday the Frosh will be tested by the strongest high
school quintet of the area, Lowell of San Francisco.
Lowell is the school that has given Don Carlson to Stanford and Ken
Flower to USC. We might be prejudiced because we went there ourself,
but this year's Lowell team is being boomed as better than the one which
was the only high school team to beat the Stanford Frosh in 1!)4K when
Jim Ramstead and Jim Walsh were starting out. And to be better than
'hat team, Lowell's personnel must be better than Ken Flower, Don
Carlson, Bill Stephenson, Fritz Fenstcr and a rebel who played at Cal.
Tito flame was lit"last Saturday night under the Stanford cagers. How
long that flame will burn is something worth considering. Saturday the
cagers gave the impression that they were a good ball club, a club that
wanted to win. Basically Stanford has not the guns to be a top-class team.
They might be next year when the only loss is George Zaninovich, the
hardest rebounder on the court. But this year Bob Burnett has turned in
a fine coaching job with average ball players.
Before Saturday there was doubt in some quarters whether the team
was hustling and playing even to its limited potential. Saturday they gave
it their all and played a whale of a ball game; they also did against LaSalle.
They can do it again if they put their hearts to it. Granted they had
an unusually fine shooting percentage Saturday, but being hot from the
floor doesn't account for the over-all play: the excellent rebounding, the
ball hawking, the defensive play, and the general team spirit and hustle.
They have proven themselves capable of these. A letdown in these depait
■ "v-nts is not excusable, though an off night in shooting, which at times
hits every club, is just one of those tilings and pardonable.
And while on the subject of basketball, it is strange to find that UCLA,
the team that invades the Pavilion this week end, was early this year
regarded as the class of the Southern Division. Now they will be fighting
with Stanford to get out of the cellar. It's USC, forecasted to be a dormat,
which is tied with California, and it should be interesting when the two
clubs collide this week end. In fact, the whole race may prove quite inter
r ting from here in out.
This morning we wish to pass our very best along to Stanford's own
Eddie Tucker, a fine athlete and gentleman. Ed left last Sunday to serve
a hitch with Uncle Sam. He deserves only the best. Ed was coaching
the Junior Varsity and had done an admirable job. His place will be
taken by assistant football coach George Lynn; wonder how the pass
defense will be?
A slightly perturbing (but if you look at it in the right vane, amusing)
uident occurred at the Friday afternoon frosh game at Berkeley last
week.
Frosli Almost Lost Tlieir Pants
The Frosh bussed up to the Cal campus together with the Junior Var
sity who were to play the Cal Blues in the 6 o'clock prelim. But lo and
behold, when the yearlings went to suit up for the 4 o clock game the
v liforms were not to be found. A search proved futile. A phone call back
to Stanford was to no avail as game tir|ie was rapidly approaching and no
planes make the trip between here and the men's gym at Berkeley.
Being faced with the not-to-pleasant prospect of being caught with
their pants down, the Frosh, under the coaching of Dick Clegg, turned to
the Braves for aid. And the Braves, who carry their suits in individual
bags which arc not left to the whims and human mistakes of managers,
were more than happy to oblige. But alas! they only had eight uniforms,
t.id the Frosh number a great deal* more than that. Clegg suited up his
eight top men, but as the Papooses drew away it was a common sight to
see a pair of uniformed players going off toward the dressing room fol
lowed by two lads in street clothes. And moments later the quarter re
turned with exchanged attire, sometimes the uniforms not fitting as well
as they might.
And through the course of the early evening, as the score widened
Clegg substituted freely and the boys changed often.
As humorous as it was, it still points to a certain lack of inefficiency in
the athletic setup. And though this incident was the direct result of a
mistake down through the ranks of the basketball managers, numerous
times in the past equipment has been stolen, misplaced or lost because
of the Athletic Department's refusal to send the necessary number of
managers on trips. This places added burden and undo strain on the man
ager that docs accompany the team as well as the trainer.
