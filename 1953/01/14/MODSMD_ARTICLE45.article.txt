# Veteran Wrestling Team Will Travel To Cal Tonight for Season's Opener
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
Have you ever wanted to tear
apart a Cal man?
Tonight the biceps boys who make
up Stanford's wrestling team will
travel over to Berkeley to try and
do just that—in the season opener
which could be one ol the crucial
meets of the year.
Last season Cal .had one of the
finest mat aggregations on the Coast,
and has a lot of good men returning.
In last season's opener, again with
Cal, the Cards were completely
blasted, 26-6.
By the end of the season, when
they met Cal again, the much-im
proved Indians held the Bears to
a 1(5-16 tie in one of the best
meets ever witnessed by Stanford
wrestling fans.
When they square off tonight,
the Cards will mat almost an
identical team to last year's, ex
cept for two notable exceptions.
For lack of a 123-pounder last
year, the Indians had to forfeit
five points in the 16-16 tie. This
season, scrappy little Steve Gee
will go at that weight.
At 130, the hero of that last Big
Meet, Oliver ("The Little Tiger")
Lyons, will try for another victory.
Lyons has been bothered \Vith a
bad shoulder for the last two years,
but when healthy, he is almost un
beatable.
After missing the whole of last
season, he returned for that one last
match. He almost pinned his man
twice in the first period, and it
looked like only a matter of time.
/Then his shoulder went out on him.

Rather than quit, he fought it out
with one arm for the remaining two
periods to take a unanimous deci
sion.
At 137 pounds, George Russell,
last year's PCC champ, should be a
favorite.
Big. surprise in the lineup is the
naming of Bruce Bailey, "the
battling legal beagle." Bailey was
expected to play junior varsity
behind Boh Jessen and John
I lauiia if he could find time from
his law books, but the scrappy
veteran is down 10 pounds below
last year's weight and has earned
a starting spot on the varsity.
Ken James, a veteran letterman
and starter from last year, will start
at 157.
A big switch in the lineup will be
between the 167 - pound and 177-
pound classes. Last year's freshman
sensation, Pat Madden, who wres
tled at 167, will start at 177, while
Jack Oglesby, last year's 177 man,
will start at 167. Both men are
formidable at either weight.
Holding down the heavyweight
spot is Phil Wilson, the little man
with all the muscles. Wilson is
5 ft. 8 in. and weighs a mere 205
pounds.
Tomorrow evening the wrestlers

will meet Oregon State in the Pavil
ion in a double-header with the
Stanford-Cal boxing match. Ore
gon State has shown real class in
past years, and came in second in
the conference last year.

For lack of a 123-pounder last
year, the Indians had to forfeit
five points in the 16-16 tie. This
season, scrappy little Steve Gee
will go at that weight.
At 130, the hero of that last Big
Meet, Oliver ("The Little Tiger")
Lyons, will try for another victory.
Lyons has been bothered \Vith a
bad shoulder for the last two years,
but when healthy, he is almost un
beatable.
After missing the whole of last
season, he returned for that one last
match. He almost pinned his man
twice in the first period, and it
looked like only a matter of time.
/Then his shoulder went out on him.

Rather than quit, he fought it out
with one arm for the remaining two
periods to take a unanimous deci
sion.
At 137 pounds, George Russell,
last year's PCC champ, should be a
favorite.
Big. surprise in the lineup is the
naming of Bruce Bailey, "the
battling legal beagle." Bailey was
expected to play junior varsity
behind Boh Jessen and John
I lauiia if he could find time from
his law books, but the scrappy
veteran is down 10 pounds below
last year's weight and has earned
a starting spot on the varsity.
Ken James, a veteran letterman
and starter from last year, will start
at 157.
A big switch in the lineup will be
between the 167 - pound and 177-
pound classes. Last year's freshman
sensation, Pat Madden, who wres
tled at 167, will start at 177, while
Jack Oglesby, last year's 177 man,
will start at 167. Both men are
formidable at either weight.
Holding down the heavyweight
spot is Phil Wilson, the little man
with all the muscles. Wilson is
5 ft. 8 in. and weighs a mere 205
pounds.
Tomorrow evening the wrestlers

will meet Oregon State in the Pavil
ion in a double-header with the
Stanford-Cal boxing match. Ore
gon State has shown real class in
past years, and came in second in
the conference last year.
Have you ever wanted to tear
apart a Cal man?
Tonight the biceps boys who make
up Stanford's wrestling team will
travel over to Berkeley to try and
do just that—in the season opener
which could be one ol the crucial
meets of the year.
Last season Cal .had one of the
finest mat aggregations on the Coast,
and has a lot of good men returning.
In last season's opener, again with
Cal, the Cards were completely
blasted, 26-6.
By the end of the season, when
they met Cal again, the much-im
proved Indians held the Bears to
a 1(5-16 tie in one of the best
meets ever witnessed by Stanford
wrestling fans.
When they square off tonight,
the Cards will mat almost an
identical team to last year's, ex
cept for two notable exceptions.
