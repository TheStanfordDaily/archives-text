"Help for self-help."
That's what European and Asian
universities need most, according to
James Kitchen, executive secretary
of the World University Service
Fund. Kitchen, whose visit to the
campus Monday was jointly spon
sored by the YWCA and the SIRO
department of lIR, discussed WUS
aims, needs, and achievements.
The tall, athletically built lecturer
emphasized the need of students in
Asia, saying that a mutual relation
ship is necessary.
"These studlnts want to be en
rolled in the work of the world.
They do not want our charity.
They will not accept it. They
want to develop their own life and
participate on an equal basis with
student organizations over the
world."
Kitchen, running his hand
through his hair, pounded the point
that our future is bound up with
that of Asia.
"Asia faces the tremendous job of
reconstruction, and if we want to
help them, a sense of understand
ing is basic and vital."
Stanford received a hearty vote of
thanks from the lecturer for its
"hardwork and substantial contri
butions" to the work of WUS. which
is the new name of the World Stu
dent Service Fund, which will re

ceive one-half of the proceeds of the
Winter Relief Drive. The drive is
scheduled for the middle of Febru
ary.
The WUS Fund, which is allo
cated hy national committees in
32 countries, goes for emergency
relief, medical care, scholarships,
hooks, and equipment.
Describing the aims of his or
ganization, the WUS representative
commented, "We try to build a
sense of university unity through
out the world by a program of
service, taking into account emer
gency needs of students and pro
fessors, as well as meeting the long
range needs and manifold problems
which confront universities in dif
ferent countries."
