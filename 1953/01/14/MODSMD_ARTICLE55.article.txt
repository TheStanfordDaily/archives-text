# Placement Service To Poll Graduates
## 
### 
For the first time in its history,
the Placement Se'rvice has initi
ated a complete'follow-up survey of
a graduating class from Stanford.
The class of '47 was chosen for
the survey. Data in the form of
completed questionnaires are ex
pected to begin coming in this week
from approximately 1,225 men and
women who received an A.B. or B.S.
in 1947.
From the questionnaires the
Placement Service will attempt to
determine such things as the effect
of defense industry on occupations
in relation to peacetime industry,
the effect of a Stanford education on
later residence, and the sequence of
jobs held after graduation.
It is hoped that this survey will
indicate something of the effective
ness of Stanford teaching.
The Stanford Associates Organiza
tion, a select group of alumni and
friends of the University, is under
writing the cost of the survey.
