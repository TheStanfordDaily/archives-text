dull" service as this country's top diplomat and reported the free
world has made great progress in repelling Communist aggres
sion.

controversy, told newsmen at a
farewell news conference that
" 'parting is such sweet sorrow'."
He also urged the overflowing
crowd to have only good will tyr
his successor, John Foster Dulles.
Reporting on the free world's ef
forts to thwart Communism, Ache

planning to spend more than $1,000,-
000,000 more in 1953 for defense
than in 1952.

Reading from notes In his own
cramped hand and written on yel
low legal tablet paper, the Secre--
tary, visibly grayer and more lined
than when he took office, said, "This
is the end, and is to be taken as
such."
