# Piano Team Joins Career With Marriage
## 
### 
The ASSU Concert Series will
present the piano team of Lubo
shutz and Nemenoff in a recital to
morrow night at 8:15 in Memorial
Auditorium.
Pierre Luboshutz and Genia Nem
enoff represent one of ttie most suc
cessful musical marriages. They
met after each had achieved fame as
a solo pianist. They were intro
duced at the Paris Conservatory,
where Luboshutz was conducting a
master class for a small group of
professionals. Mi.ss Nemenoff en
rolled in the class and the couple
v/as married soon after.
Their professional partnership
began when they gave impromptu
joint piano recitals to please their
friends. Now they never play solo
concerts, and usually even prac
tice together (even scales and
technical exercises to make their
joint technique more secure).
In case either feels like practicing
or playing alone there is an extra
piano in both their New York apart
ment and their country home in
Maine, s,o altogether they have six
pianos. *
Before World War 11, Luboshutz
and Nemenoff built up a reputation
in Europe. Since then, they have
played with every major orchestra
in the United States.
When they returned to Europe
last spring, their tour included a
command performance with the
Atehns Symphony Orchestra for
King Paul and Queen Frederica
of Greece. They also went to the
new nation of Israel, where they
were received so well that they
were immediately lMÂ»oked for the
following season.
Luboshutz and Nemenoff's pro
gram at Stanford will include Mo
zart's "Sonata in D Major,'' "Per
petual Motion" by Portnoff, and
Pierre Luboshutz's arrangement of
"Die Fledermaus" by Johann
Strauss.
