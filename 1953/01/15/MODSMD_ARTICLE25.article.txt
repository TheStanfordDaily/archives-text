# ASST. MANAGER
## New Office Established By Excom 
### MARY MASSEY Daily Associate Editor 
The post of assistant student
manager was created by Excom
last night upon the recommenda
tion of Steve Horn, the incum
bent student manager.
In describing his seven to eight
hour a day job, Horn stated that his
duties have grown to such propor
tions that one man cannot handle
them alone. He said that a qualified
assistant could do such chores as
signing the GO to 80 purchase orders
which must be signed every day, con
ducting price surveys, and orienting
club treasurers to their jobs.
Charlotte Trego questioned the ad
visability of paying such a person, the
qualifications of the person, and how
long the office .would continue.
Dick Weisrnann, ASSU president,
pointed out that Horn is active on
many committees and projects that
the routine student managers have
not concerned themselves with. Ac
cordingly, an assistant might not be
necessary in the ordinary case.
Horn, who is working on a new
student information service, the
Union Planning Committee, and
other projects "above and beyond
the call of duty," felt that his
knowledge of student activities was
vital to them and to Stanford.
Dorothy Dodge, Daily editor,
backed up Horn in the good results
brought about by his special concern
with individual activities, including
the Daily.
Following the discussion, Excom
voted unanimously to create the job
of an assistant student manager, with
a salary of $35 a month, to continue
spring quarter, 1953. Horn will ap
point the assistant on the basis of
experience and capability for the
position.
Horn also gave his student man
ager's report, in which he put forth
his objectives for the rest of the year,
including reorganization of commit
tees for more efficiency and a new
procedure for working out the
budget. He also pointed out that
Stanford is the oidy university in the
United States which has a student in
control of all student funds.
Jack Eraser, chairman of the
Union Planning Committee, ap
i peared before Excom to outline the
plans of the committee in its survey
i of student needs and desires in the
new Union building. A special issue
of the Daily on February 2 will kick
off a series of talks in living groups,
hearings, and questionnaires to
guide the administration in design
ing the building.
Excom approved appointments to
the new Library Committee. Conrad
Cox will be graduate representative
and chairman; Ann Alabaster, senior
representative; Jackie Whiteman,
junior representative; and Bob Gled
hill, sophomore representative. The
freshman representative will be an
nounced next week.
Nancy Clark, chairman of the pub
lic relations committee, presented to
Excom a set of regulations in the
form of a contract for the use of the
public address system. Due to com
plaints of noise, the regulations re
strict the time of day for use, the
number of words per announcement,
and volume.
Jean Leonard reported on the pos
sibilities of a Stanford book of songs.
It was decided to renew the contract
with Broadcast Music Incorporated
for revising a Stanford song book to
be sold at the Bookstore.
Excom voted to give Prince
Lightfoot two free passes to the
rest of Stanford's athletic events
this year in appreciation of his serv
ices to the student body.
Excom approved a French movie
sponsored by the French House on
Feb. 16 in Cubberley Auditorium.
