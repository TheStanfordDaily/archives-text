President-elect Eisenhower took the first step
Tuesday in a program which may greatly
strengthen the Republican Party's position in
the South. He appointed T. Coieman Andrews
of Richmond, Va., to the post of Commissioner
of Internal Revenue.
Behind this move lies a United Press story
of several weeks ago which reported that Eisen
hower would dole out patronage to the so-called
"Independent Democrats" who supported him
in the presidential campaign.
Andrews is one of these, and Sen. Harry F.
Byrd, another Eisenhower Democrat, gave
"highly worded praise" in recommending him
for the post.
The reasoning of Ike and his staff is that
rewarding the South for its part in the Repub
lican election may make that region more GOP
minded.
Prominent Southerners holding Republi
can posts could assert a great deal ol in
fluence toward this type ol thinking.
11 successful, the move will not only
strengthen the Republican position nation
ally, but also bring to the South the benefits
of the two-party system.
Sen. Robert O. Taft, on the other hand,
long termed "Mr. Republican," seems to be
showing his true colors concerning the welfare
of the party.
Since before election time, mutterings have
been coming from the Taft c?mp to the extent
that: "I wasn't contacted on this or that."
Now the Ohioan has obtained for himself a
seat on the key Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee, where he and his "quasi-isolationism"
can exert a veto power over Eisenhower's for
eign policy.
A letter published yesterday vehemently
denouncing the appointment of Martin P.*
Durkin as Secretary of Labor is the most re
cent statement in a series which seems to be

leading directly toward an open split be
tween the President and Talt.
We do not propose to discuss Durkin's ap
pointment other than to say that there are other
men whose appointment might have been more
advisable, among them, California's own Com
missioner of Labor Lloyd C. Mashburn, a
Republican who received a minor post in the
new administration.
However, it seems that if Sen. Taft has a
sincere devotion to the Republjfran party he
would:
1. Realize that Dwight Eisenhower and not
Bob Taft is now leader and boss of that party.
2. Attempt to iron out their differences in
private conferences, not wilh intemperate
utterances.
If there's one thing that will cripple the Re
publican Administration during a period,
it will be an inability for that party to take
concerted action.—Jim Madison.
