# Good News

It's good news that one of Stanford's most
valuable groups of citizens is again becoming
active.
The Graduate Student Association is now
making a drive for active members to carry out
a program of activities for the year. All grad
students are invited to a coffee hour this after
noon at 3:30 in Bowman Alumni House.
We consider the graduate students one of
Stanford's most vital elements. From the stand
point of both intelligence and maturity, they
have a lot to contribute to student government.
The activities of the Graduate Association
can be discussion forums as well as social
events. We hope some useful opinions may
come back to Excom as a result of the Associa
tion's work.
