# BULL SESSION

### SAM FRESHMAN 
It is highly doubtful whether an investigating com
mittee could prove that I am in favor of rights for
women. As a matter of fact, I am not; and never have
been a member of any party or organization that advo
cates such a radical policy.
I feel, as do most of the intelligent and thinking
men on campus, that Stanford women are (guess),

but despite this they do deserve
a few minor privileges and con
siderations.
One of the oldest traditions, on
this campus is that when a fellow
brings his girl back to the dorm
late he sends her a box of candy
as an apology. This tradition is
of late dying out and at least one j
group of people on this campus |
wants to sec it revived (namely,
the women).

As with every great social question, there are two
sides to the issue. On the one side are the men who
contend that they are unable to afford such absurd
luxuries as boxes of candy. The question is raised
then that if an individual's financial status is that low,
what the heck is he doing out that late. Remember,
if you attempt to answer this question, that, anything
you say may be hold against you by her parents.
Furthermore, there are those that contend that if
a girl is lair it is her own fault for not reminding
her date of the timr. However, in this case we must
remember that girls, being the weaker sex physi
cally, might also he ditto mentally. Science has as
yet been unable to prove this theory, hut this does
not necessarily mean that it is false (see Journal of

Male Supremacy, page U2, 11.3, Dec. 1, 1674).
The theory of female mental weakness was origi
nally termed Schmoe's Law, and mothers, taking
advantage of their early impression on children, urged
them time and again not to believe it; hence the ex
pression in our culture, "Don't be a schmoe."
On the other side of the issue are the candy stores
in the Palo Alto-Menlo Park area. They went to con
siderable expense to get this tradition established,
it being rumored that two student body presidents
were bribed to include the tradition as part of the
ASSU constitution in the early part of the century,
but when the scheme was discovered the officials
could not complete the move.
Further, the social regulations at Stanford apply
to women only, and a male student may return to
the dormitory at any time of night, or even not at
all (and usually never does), and it is only fair that
he do something when he causes a girl to he late.
Upon looking at both sides of the issue fairly and
objectively, I must come to the conclusion that this
tradition should definitely not be allowed to die. For
those who have any questions I suggest they see
Women's Council. You may also write your con
gressman or Emily Post as to whether the tradition is
retroactive. One co-ed informs me that if so, she
has five pounds of candy due.
While on the subject of traditions, we might as well
throw in a little bit about stopping to pick up people
for rides at the tree and the corner of Palm Drive.
Wherever you are going, please stop and pick up
that good-looking chap at the corner of Palm Drive.
I was there until 12 last night.
