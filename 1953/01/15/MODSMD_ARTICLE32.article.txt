# Grad Students Start Drive for Members
## 
### MARY FRAZER 
Still wondering what those mimeographed sheets passed out
on reg day screaming "Graduate Students Unite!" were all about?
This is the unique manner in which the Graduate Students' As
sociation announces a coffee hour this afternoon from 3:30 to 5
in the Bowman Alumni House.
Chartered only last year, the Association provides an informal

discussion forum as well as a
for social activities. Graduate stu
dents, lacking definite class organi
zation and centralized housing, are
finding that the Association meets
these needs in part.
During its year of organi
zation, a few coffee hours and dis
cussions were held, and a new
page for grad students was in
eluded in the Stanford Handbook,
sent to all entering graduates.
A special invitation for tomorrow's
coffee hour is extended to grad stu
dents interested in working with the
Association during the year.
A membership drive is being con
ducted by the group throughout the
quarter. Although all grad students
are nominally members, the present
drive aims*to secure active mem
bers. At any of the group's coffee
hours, membership cards are on sale
for 25 cents.
Active members are needed to
plan activities, and to work on
problems of grad student hous
ing, orientation, grad-faculty re
lationships, increased social and
intellectual contact among gradu
ate students.
Last quarter graduates comprised
approximately 30 per ccnt of the
total number of students at Stan
ford. They are enrolled mainly in
the Schools of Education, Engineer
ing, Business, Law, and Medicine.
