## DEALING THE CARDS 
### 
This is a column about our orphan crew—that crew that is as much a
part of Stanford as the football team and basketball team, Memorial Church,
Encina, and the immortal 21. It is not an original column—only a very
small part was written by me. The rest was written by a fellow named
Jrantland Rice way back when in 1915.
It concerns an orphan crew in the Poughkeepsie Regatta, and is inscribed
on a plaque on the wall of crew manager Gerald Dow in 31 Stern Hall.
It is a story of the Stanfords in the days when they were called a "college"
and the pennant they flew was "maroon." It is a story of men who gave
their all in everything, even if they weren't known or didn't have the big
names. It is a story of a spirit that will live as long as the school lives,
and longer than any one of us.
And now to Mr. Grantland Rice:
POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y.—This is the tale of the underdog and the con
fusion of rowing experts. 'As a usual thing, the expert—particularly the
rowing expert—is right, but on a bright June afternoon the rowing experts
were thrown into utter confusion by a crew from Stanford University, on
the Pacific Coast, who churned the waters of the Hudson with wholly
unauthorized strokes, all but winning one of the hai'dest fought races ever
owed over the Poughkeepsie course.
They rowed in no fas'hion within the ken of experts. They splashed
until their shell was almost awash with water, but at one time they had
the best crew (hat Cornell ever trained, headed and gasping. That was
at the three and a half-mile mark. At the finish the Stanford crew was
just a quarter of a length behind and creeping up.
Several of the Cornell crew collapsed at the finish. Not a man dropped
in the Stanford boat. When the crew saw that the race was finished they
.urned the shell around and proceeded to row back to their training quar
ters on the upper Hudson. The. shells of the other colleges were towed
back, while the crews were removed and wrapped in blankets.
The Stanford crew had no launch. The youngsters had come to the race
"on their own" as the college had given no funds to send them to the race.
As a matter of fact, they did not have carfare back to the coast and were
considering putting their shell in pawn to raise the transportation when a
Californian sportsman who heard of their plight put up the money to pay
vheir way home.
This Stanford crew was never considered before the race. One of the
best rowing experts who saw them practice, announced: "They are ter
rible. They splash. They do not know how to row. They have no co
ordination. In fact, they have nothing. Their boat is old-fashioned. They
might learn to row in a couple of years, for they are big and strong, hut
right now they are impossible."
Consequently, when the race started* partisans of Cornell, Columbia,
Syracuse, and Penn were watching their boats closely. Syracuse got away
with a flying start. An ugly, unkempt shell forged into second place, flying
a maroon pennant with the letter S in the stern. The men in the boat were
rowing grotesquely and atrociously.
"What funny-looking outfit is that?" somebody asked.
"Oh, that must be that Stanford crew," was replied, "early speed, but
they won't finish anywhere."
Yet when Syracuse began to weary and the Cornell crew forged ahead,
the ugly Stanford shell clung to second place. Each man seemed to be
rowing his own individual stroke, yet the net result was a steady power
that kept the Stanford crew abreast of the best that Cornell ever sent to
Poughkeepsie. And at the three and a half-mile mark, for a few palpitating
seconds the Stanford crew was leading Cornell, with the others out of it
altogether.
Syracuse developed a spurt, and the race closed with the Stanford crew
; ust a quarter of a length behind the winning shell.
Afterward, C. H. Orme, who was No. 6 of the Stanford crew, said:
"We were not very familiar with the course as we were over it only
once. We thought we had a half-mile or more to go and were lying back
waiting for a call for a spurt. We had plenty of spurt in us. We were not
a bit tired at the finish."
When the Poughkeepsie course is restored to its own and the x-egattas
are there again, they will tell the tale anew of the Stanford crew that
Jiurned up the Hudson and had the rowing experts on the verge of heart
failure. . . .
The plaque was given to the crew by Lt. Cmdr. A. A. Clark, coach
of the 1948-1949 crew. On the bottom he has written:
KEEP THIS SPIRIT—THIS FIGHT—THIS WILL TO WIN
And we think they will; and we think, in future years, when the regattas
issemble at Poughkeepsie or any place else, those shells with the "maroon"
banners and the S on the stern will still be there, manned by men with
the same spirit as those eight men and coxswain who rowed the course
way back in '15.

This Stanford crew was never considered before the race. One of the
best rowing experts who saw them practice, announced: "They are ter
rible. They splash. They do not know how to row. They have no co
ordination. In fact, they have nothing. Their boat is old-fashioned. They
might learn to row in a couple of years, for they are big and strong, hut
right now they are impossible."
Consequently, when the race started* partisans of Cornell, Columbia,
Syracuse, and Penn were watching their boats closely. Syracuse got away
with a flying start. An ugly, unkempt shell forged into second place, flying
a maroon pennant with the letter S in the stern. The men in the boat were
rowing grotesquely and atrociously.
"What funny-looking outfit is that?" somebody asked.
"Oh, that must be that Stanford crew," was replied, "early speed, but
they won't finish anywhere."
Yet when Syracuse began to weary and the Cornell crew forged ahead,
the ugly Stanford shell clung to second place. Each man seemed to be
rowing his own individual stroke, yet the net result was a steady power
that kept the Stanford crew abreast of the best that Cornell ever sent to
Poughkeepsie. And at the three and a half-mile mark, for a few palpitating
seconds the Stanford crew was leading Cornell, with the others out of it
altogether.
Syracuse developed a spurt, and the race closed with the Stanford crew
; ust a quarter of a length behind the winning shell.
Afterward, C. H. Orme, who was No. 6 of the Stanford crew, said:
"We were not very familiar with the course as we were over it only
once. We thought we had a half-mile or more to go and were lying back
waiting for a call for a spurt. We had plenty of spurt in us. We were not
a bit tired at the finish."
When the Poughkeepsie course is restored to its own and the x-egattas
are there again, they will tell the tale anew of the Stanford crew that
Jiurned up the Hudson and had the rowing experts on the verge of heart
failure. . . .
The plaque was given to the crew by Lt. Cmdr. A. A. Clark, coach
of the 1948-1949 crew. On the bottom he has written:
KEEP THIS SPIRIT—THIS FIGHT—THIS WILL TO WIN
And we think they will; and we think, in future years, when the regattas
issemble at Poughkeepsie or any place else, those shells with the "maroon"
banners and the S on the stern will still be there, manned by men with
the same spirit as those eight men and coxswain who rowed the course
way back in '15.
This is a column about our orphan crew—that crew that is as much a
part of Stanford as the football team and basketball team, Memorial Church,
Encina, and the immortal 21. It is not an original column—only a very
small part was written by me. The rest was written by a fellow named
Jrantland Rice way back when in 1915.
It concerns an orphan crew in the Poughkeepsie Regatta, and is inscribed
on a plaque on the wall of crew manager Gerald Dow in 31 Stern Hall.
It is a story of the Stanfords in the days when they were called a "college"
and the pennant they flew was "maroon." It is a story of men who gave
their all in everything, even if they weren't known or didn't have the big
names. It is a story of a spirit that will live as long as the school lives,
and longer than any one of us.
And now to Mr. Grantland Rice:
POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y.—This is the tale of the underdog and the con
fusion of rowing experts. 'As a usual thing, the expert—particularly the
rowing expert—is right, but on a bright June afternoon the rowing experts
were thrown into utter confusion by a crew from Stanford University, on
the Pacific Coast, who churned the waters of the Hudson with wholly
unauthorized strokes, all but winning one of the hai'dest fought races ever
owed over the Poughkeepsie course.
They rowed in no fas'hion within the ken of experts. They splashed
until their shell was almost awash with water, but at one time they had
the best crew (hat Cornell ever trained, headed and gasping. That was
at the three and a half-mile mark. At the finish the Stanford crew was
just a quarter of a length behind and creeping up.
Several of the Cornell crew collapsed at the finish. Not a man dropped
in the Stanford boat. When the crew saw that the race was finished they
.urned the shell around and proceeded to row back to their training quar
ters on the upper Hudson. The. shells of the other colleges were towed
back, while the crews were removed and wrapped in blankets.
The Stanford crew had no launch. The youngsters had come to the race
"on their own" as the college had given no funds to send them to the race.
As a matter of fact, they did not have carfare back to the coast and were
considering putting their shell in pawn to raise the transportation when a
Californian sportsman who heard of their plight put up the money to pay
vheir way home.

banners and the S on the stern will still be there, manned by men with
the same spirit as those eight men and coxswain who rowed the course
way back in '15.
This is a column about our orphan crew—that crew that is as much a
part of Stanford as the football team and basketball team, Memorial Church,
Encina, and the immortal 21. It is not an original column—only a very
small part was written by me. The rest was written by a fellow named
Jrantland Rice way back when in 1915.
It concerns an orphan crew in the Poughkeepsie Regatta, and is inscribed
on a plaque on the wall of crew manager Gerald Dow in 31 Stern Hall.
It is a story of the Stanfords in the days when they were called a "college"
and the pennant they flew was "maroon." It is a story of men who gave
their all in everything, even if they weren't known or didn't have the big
names. It is a story of a spirit that will live as long as the school lives,
and longer than any one of us.
And now to Mr. Grantland Rice:
POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y.—This is the tale of the underdog and the con
fusion of rowing experts. 'As a usual thing, the expert—particularly the
rowing expert—is right, but on a bright June afternoon the rowing experts
were thrown into utter confusion by a crew from Stanford University, on
the Pacific Coast, who churned the waters of the Hudson with wholly
unauthorized strokes, all but winning one of the hai'dest fought races ever
owed over the Poughkeepsie course.
They rowed in no fas'hion within the ken of experts. They splashed
until their shell was almost awash with water, but at one time they had
the best crew (hat Cornell ever trained, headed and gasping. That was
at the three and a half-mile mark. At the finish the Stanford crew was
just a quarter of a length behind and creeping up.
Several of the Cornell crew collapsed at the finish. Not a man dropped
in the Stanford boat. When the crew saw that the race was finished they
.urned the shell around and proceeded to row back to their training quar
ters on the upper Hudson. The. shells of the other colleges were towed
back, while the crews were removed and wrapped in blankets.
The Stanford crew had no launch. The youngsters had come to the race
"on their own" as the college had given no funds to send them to the race.
As a matter of fact, they did not have carfare back to the coast and were
considering putting their shell in pawn to raise the transportation when a
Californian sportsman who heard of their plight put up the money to pay
vheir way home.
This Stanford crew was never considered before the race. One of the
best rowing experts who saw them practice, announced: "They are ter
rible. They splash. They do not know how to row. They have no co
ordination. In fact, they have nothing. Their boat is old-fashioned. They
might learn to row in a couple of years, for they are big and strong, hut
right now they are impossible."
Consequently, when the race started* partisans of Cornell, Columbia,
Syracuse, and Penn were watching their boats closely. Syracuse got away
with a flying start. An ugly, unkempt shell forged into second place, flying
a maroon pennant with the letter S in the stern. The men in the boat were
rowing grotesquely and atrociously.
"What funny-looking outfit is that?" somebody asked.
"Oh, that must be that Stanford crew," was replied, "early speed, but
they won't finish anywhere."
Yet when Syracuse began to weary and the Cornell crew forged ahead,
the ugly Stanford shell clung to second place. Each man seemed to be
rowing his own individual stroke, yet the net result was a steady power
that kept the Stanford crew abreast of the best that Cornell ever sent to
Poughkeepsie. And at the three and a half-mile mark, for a few palpitating
seconds the Stanford crew was leading Cornell, with the others out of it
altogether.
Syracuse developed a spurt, and the race closed with the Stanford crew
; ust a quarter of a length behind the winning shell.
Afterward, C. H. Orme, who was No. 6 of the Stanford crew, said:
"We were not very familiar with the course as we were over it only
once. We thought we had a half-mile or more to go and were lying back
waiting for a call for a spurt. We had plenty of spurt in us. We were not
a bit tired at the finish."
When the Poughkeepsie course is restored to its own and the x-egattas
are there again, they will tell the tale anew of the Stanford crew that
Jiurned up the Hudson and had the rowing experts on the verge of heart
failure. . . .
The plaque was given to the crew by Lt. Cmdr. A. A. Clark, coach
of the 1948-1949 crew. On the bottom he has written:
KEEP THIS SPIRIT—THIS FIGHT—THIS WILL TO WIN
