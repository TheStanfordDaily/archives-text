# Cards Prep for Bruin Invasion; Both Fight to Avoid Cellar
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
UCLA, the basketball team that
was supposed to glide to the cham
pionship but which now resides in
the Cellar with Stanford, invades
Indianville for a pair of weekend
tilts that should be hectic, if noth
ing else.
Both the Indians and Bruins love
the fast break, which makes for
games that rival a ping pong match
.is far as spectator neck-twisting is
concerned.
Both Stanford and UCLA have
one-won, three-lost records.
Ron Tomsie and Olie Suzdaleff,
upon whose small shoulders rest so
much of the weight of Stanford's
chances, are in the top five in PCC
Southern Davision scoring. The jut
jawed Tomsic is third with 66 points
for a 16.5 average and SuzdalefT is
tied for fourth with 53 digits and a
13.3 average.
The top Uclan point - maker is
ghostly Dick Ridgeway, who has

averaged 12 tallies a game.
Tomsic leads the league in free
throw percentage with an amazing
.923 average. He has hit 12 for 13.
SuzdalefT is third with 19 for 22 and
an .864 record.
Johnny Wooden's Bruins have av
eraged 65 points a game, compared
to the Cards' 62.8. Bob Burnett's
team has given up 69 points a con
test, as compared to UCLA's 66.8.
So far this season, the Bruins
have a 4-4 record in their own gym,
and a 4-1 record on the road. This
is quite a turnabout, since the Uclans
are rarely headed in their own
quarters.
