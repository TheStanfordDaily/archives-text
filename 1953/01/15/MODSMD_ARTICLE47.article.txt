# WRESTLERS TOO
## Boxers Face Strong Cal In Tonight's Daily-Double 
### BOB MISHELL 
The second half of tonight's double
attraction at the Pavilion will fea
ture the 1953 debut of the Stanford
boxing team. The matches with the
favored Bears are slated to start at

8:30, immediately after the wrestling
match between the Indians and Ore
gon State.
Coach Ray Lunny declined to pre
dict who would win the match, but
he seemed to feel that his untried
Indians would give Coach Ed Ne
mir's Bears a good battle.
The Lunnymen go into the contest
without the services of veteran Tony
Wynn. who was declared out for the
season because of a jaw injury he
suffered during football practice last
spring. Wynn's withdrawal leaves
the Cards with no one in the 166-lb.
class, and the forfeit will hurt their
chances.
One of the best matches of the eve
ning should be in the 177—1b. class
between Stanford's ace, Bob Bal
docchi, and Cal's Floyd McFarland.
Baldocchi, who won six straight in
the 166 class last year, is considered
by Lunny to be the best in his class
on the coast.
Another top match is slated in the
132-lb. class between Gary Sievert
of the Indians and Ken Hansen of
the Bears. Sievert is one of the bet
ter men on the Card squad, winning
his match against Cal last year.

Hansen is rated by many observers
as the PCC's best boxer in his'divi
sion.
Coach Lunny predicted that Jack
Owens and Eric Hansen would make
good showings for themselves this
evening. Footballer Norm Manoo
gian is making his debut as a heavy
weight. Although he lacks experi
ence, he has looked good in practice.

without the services of veteran Tony
Wynn. who was declared out for the
season because of a jaw injury he
suffered during football practice last
spring. Wynn's withdrawal leaves
the Cards with no one in the 166-lb.
class, and the forfeit will hurt their
chances.
One of the best matches of the eve
ning should be in the 177—1b. class
between Stanford's ace, Bob Bal
docchi, and Cal's Floyd McFarland.
Baldocchi, who won six straight in
the 166 class last year, is considered
by Lunny to be the best in his class
on the coast.
Another top match is slated in the
132-lb. class between Gary Sievert
of the Indians and Ken Hansen of
the Bears. Sievert is one of the bet
ter men on the Card squad, winning
his match against Cal last year.

Hansen is rated by many observers
as the PCC's best boxer in his'divi
sion.
Coach Lunny predicted that Jack
Owens and Eric Hansen would make
good showings for themselves this
evening. Footballer Norm Manoo
gian is making his debut as a heavy
weight. Although he lacks experi
ence, he has looked good in practice.
