## Two-Platoon System Outlawed by NCAA 
### 
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., Jan. 14
(UP) — The two-platoon system in
college football was outlawed today
under a ruling by the National Col
legiate Athletic Association rules
committee.
The new regulation changing the
previous free substitution rule, un
der which the platoon system oper
ates, reads:
"A player withdrawn from the
game during either the .first or third
periods may not return during the
period from which he was with
dawn."
The new rule also states, "A play
er withdrawn from the game before
the final four minutes of either the
second or fourth period may return

duing the final four minutes of the
period in which he was withdrawn.
But if he is withdrawn in the final
four minutes of either the second or
fourth period, he may not return
during that four-minute period."
The effect of that regulation makes
it virtually impossible for coaches
to employ the platoon system where
they could freely substitute players
as they saw fit.
Coach Chuck Taylor of Stanford
University said today he had "al
ways been in favor" of eliminating
the platoon system, but admitted lie
was "surprised" at the action of the
NCAA rules committee.
Taylor said he believed some of
the larger schools would retain a
semblance of the platoon system by
playing the full game with two teams
—one in the first half and another in
the second. «
"I believe it is a good rule change,
as it will teach the players to handle
both offensive and defensive assign
ments," he said.
