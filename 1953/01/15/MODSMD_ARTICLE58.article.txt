# Broke in '92; Boom in ,52
## Bookstore Marks 60 Years' Service

The Stock Exchange didn't re
cord it, but stock was selling on
the Stanford campus in 1891.
For $2.50 a share students were
buying into the Co-op Associa
tion, bookstore for the new Uni
versity.
The Co-op did not fare very well.
In fact, it went broke the next year.
But from those beginnings arose the
present Stanford Bookstore, where
for the last-.week and a half Stan
ford students have been standing in
the usual lines to purchase many
thousands of books.
Since 1897 the Bookstore's
steadily improving financial con
dition lias raised customer rebates
from a low of three per cent to
lUsl's record high of 22Va per cent.
But things were tough in the be
ginning.
The Co-op ran into trouble first
of all in 1892, when so many stock
certificates were offered for redemp
tion that the management ruled that
only graduates could redeem their
stock. The store, then housed in a
small wooden structure where Cub
berley stands, ran so far into debt
that the University took over.
A group of professors appointed
by Dr. Jordan investigated the
Bookstore situation, decided to
start all over again. In 1897 the
organization known for the last
56 years as the Stanford Bookstore
opened in what is now the Daily
Shack, with $15,000 in borrowed
capital.
In accordance with the plan of
1897 the Stanford Bookstore is in the
novel position of being owned by
neither the University nor the AS
SU. It is administered by a Board
of Directors whose sole personal
financial interest in the assets of
the store is the $1 membership" fee
they paid. The Board receives no
dividends, but customers do—in the
form of rebates.
By 1906 the Bookstore's business
was booming so that the store
outgrew the shack. The Board
finished constructing a new build

ing only two months before the
big earthquake came along. It
caused slight damages.
The 1953 Bookstore is still housed
in that same building of 1906 —en-
larged and remodeled. Until 1929 a
grocery store and an ice cream par
lor operated in rooms that are now
the Bookstore's office, stock room,
and receiving department.
Like many other University
buildings, the present Bookstore
needs room for expansion! But
plans for more building will have
to wait until money and material
are available.
Until then the familiar lines will
remain a beginning-of-the-quarter
tradition.
