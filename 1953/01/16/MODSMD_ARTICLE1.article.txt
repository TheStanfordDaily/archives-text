DEFIES GOVERNMENT Mrs. Mary D. Cain displays the hack
saw she used to cut a government padlock from the door of
her newspaper plant at Summit, Miss. The plant was seized
after Mrs. Cain refused to pay $42 in social security taxes.
Claiming the tax to be "unconstitutional" and "confiscatory,"
Mrs. Cain has challenged the government to jail her so she can
get a court test of her case. â€”NEA Wirephoto
