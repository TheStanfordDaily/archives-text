# Indian Cagers Rattle Speedy Bruin Squad
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Basketball, UCLA and Stanford version, which takes on the
neck-twisting proportions of a ping pong match and the greased
speed of a 100-yard dash, goes in the Pavilion for locul consump
tion at 8 this evening and does an encore tomorrow at the same
time.
Of all the PCC contests, UCLA and the Indians usually have the

most interesting it not thf* most ar
tistic. Botli squads employ the fast
break, which makes for interesting,
high-scoring games.
After losing three straight PCC
Southern Division contests, the pre
season favorite Bruirvs nailed pre
viously unbeaten USC last Satur
day. Bob Burnett's underlings also
dropped their first three league
games, and then played spectacular
ball to mutilate the Bears, 7G to 00,
last Saturday.
However, from tin* Athletic De
partment comes the warning of
Burnett, who says, "I'd say that
UCLA lias the top personnel in
the conference, and that includes
Cal. If I had to pick out the two
top men on the UCLA team, I
couldn't do it. They're all danger
ous."
Johnny Wooden, the Bruins' ca
pable, angry little couch, started
forward. Hank Steinman and guard
Barry Porter last Saturday to stim
ulate a little competition among his
first string, and it worked.
HoweVer, insiders believe that
Wooden will go with his old stand
bys tonight. And that would be
Dick Ridgway (six-four) and Ron
Bane (six-two) at forwards, John
Moore (six-five) at center, and Ron
Livingston (five-ten) and Don Bragg
(six-four) at guards. Baiie, Bragg,
and Moore are sophs and Ridgway
and Livingston are juniors. Our fu
ture looks bad!
Ridgway was the sensation of
the league two years ago. lie sat
out last season because some UC
LA profs were academic enough
to dunk him, hut this year he's
beginning to show the same form
that made him break a Bruin
scoring record his soph year.
San Francisco's Don Bragg and
husky Johnny Moore are two of the
finest prospects in Westwood his
tory.
To win, the Indians will have to
be as strong on the boards as they
were last week. The Cards' hard
driving George Zaninovich played
the best game pf his career last Sat
urday, and his continued improve
ment is instrumental in Stanford
victory plans.
Ron Tomsic, who possesses one of
the best shooting eyes in the league,
is number three scorer in the con

frence and has the top free-throw
percentage. Upon him will rest a
good part of the Indians' victory
hopes. The continued improvement
of Don DeLong and Don Carlson
will also be big factors.
Practice sessions this week have
been aimed at slowing down the
Uclan fast break.

Barry Porter last Saturday to stim
ulate a little competition among his
first string, and it worked.
HoweVer, insiders believe that
Wooden will go with his old stand
bys tonight. And that would be
Dick Ridgway (six-four) and Ron
Bane (six-two) at forwards, John
Moore (six-five) at center, and Ron
Livingston (five-ten) and Don Bragg
(six-four) at guards. Baiie, Bragg,
and Moore are sophs and Ridgway
and Livingston are juniors. Our fu
ture looks bad!
Ridgway was the sensation of
the league two years ago. lie sat
out last season because some UC
LA profs were academic enough
to dunk him, hut this year he's
beginning to show the same form
that made him break a Bruin
scoring record his soph year.
San Francisco's Don Bragg and
husky Johnny Moore are two of the
finest prospects in Westwood his
tory.
To win, the Indians will have to
be as strong on the boards as they
were last week. The Cards' hard
driving George Zaninovich played
the best game pf his career last Sat
urday, and his continued improve
ment is instrumental in Stanford
victory plans.
Ron Tomsic, who possesses one of
the best shooting eyes in the league,
is number three scorer in the con

frence and has the top free-throw
percentage. Upon him will rest a
good part of the Indians' victory
hopes. The continued improvement
of Don DeLong and Don Carlson
will also be big factors.
Practice sessions this week have
been aimed at slowing down the
Uclan fast break.

Of all the PCC contests, UCLA and the Indians usually have the

most interesting it not thf* most ar
tistic. Botli squads employ the fast
break, which makes for interesting,
high-scoring games.
After losing three straight PCC
Southern Division contests, the pre
season favorite Bruirvs nailed pre
viously unbeaten USC last Satur
day. Bob Burnett's underlings also
dropped their first three league
games, and then played spectacular
ball to mutilate the Bears, 7G to 00,
last Saturday.
However, from tin* Athletic De
partment comes the warning of
Burnett, who says, "I'd say that
UCLA lias the top personnel in
the conference, and that includes
Cal. If I had to pick out the two
top men on the UCLA team, I
couldn't do it. They're all danger
