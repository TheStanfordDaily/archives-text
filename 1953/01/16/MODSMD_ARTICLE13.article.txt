# Duo-Pianists Will Perform In Concert Series Tonight
## 
### NAN CERINI 
Luboshutz and Nemenoff, the only duo-pianists in this country
who have played with Maestio Arturo Toscanini, will be featured
tonight at 8:15 in the ASSU Concert Series recital in Memorial
Auditorium.
Pierre Luboshutz and his wife, Genia Nernenoff, are in their

eighteenth anniversary tour of the J
United States. They have played
with the major orchestras here, as
well as many of those in Europe, in
cluding the Athens Symphony Or
chestra in a command performance
for King Paul and Queen Frederica
of Greece last year.
Lubotshutz, Russian by birth, is
full of warmth and energy, while
Mrs. Luboshutz, a Parisienne of Rus
sian extraction, is quieter and more
retiring. •
However, the core of both their
1 lives is music and playing the piano
together. In duo-piano work, they
j have achieved much unity—"their
| twenty fingers strike as ten." accord
ing to "Newsweek Magazine." Or
chestral richness is reached by blend
ing rather than imitating tones.
In their program here tonight they
will play Mozart's "Sonata in I)
Major," Reger's "Introduction, Pas
sacaglia and Fugue, Opus Joio's
"Suite from the Ballet 'On Stage',"
Portnoft's "Perpetual Motion," De

bussy's "Lindaraja," and Luboshutz's
arrangement of Strauss's "Die Fle
dei maus."
Tickets for the concert are still on
sale at the ASSU Concert Series
Office in the Nitery between 1 and 5
this afternoon, and will be sold at the
door tonight. Prices'' for single tickets
are $1, $1.50, $2. and $2.50.
