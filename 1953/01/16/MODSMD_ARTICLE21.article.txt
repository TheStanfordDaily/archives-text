# We Suggest as Worth While

Interested in doing something contributory?
Here are a few things we suggest as worth
while:
Spend a dollar for a Cap and Gown calen
dar. The money goes into a scholarship fund
which will bring a girl from abroad to Stan
ford to study for a year. Besides, for your
money you get a convenient calendar with
some good-looking pictures of Stanford.
Make a place in this quarter's budget for a
good-sized donation to the Foreign Relief Drive,
which starts Feb. 16. Money will go to the
Red Cross, which is now doing especially
valiant work in Koreaâ€”besides its other activi
ties around the world, and also to the World
Student Service Fund, in a contribution labeled
especially for Asia.
Give a pint of blood to the Village Blood
Drive before it ends, Jan. 23. The blood you
give will help a fellow member of the Stan
ford family in time of emergency.
Start planning now to donate blood in the
big Spring Quarter Blood Drive. We consider
this one of the most worthwhile activities ever

undertaken by the ASSU. It's a marvelous
chance for anyone interested in helping any
one in Korea to do something concrete and
important. And, by the way, you can give
blood to the Village Drive before Jan. 23 and
still be eligible to donate in the Spring Drive.
