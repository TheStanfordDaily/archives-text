Some roses this week to:
The members of the Stanford Band, who
added some real sparkle to the week-end bas
ketball game. They sounded great.
The planners of Saturday night's Winter
Whirl. We've heard lots of good reports about
a big turnout and a well-planned dance.
The Stanford Music Department, for initiat
ing a new program of exchanging pianists with
other universities. This represents another
fine cultural opportunity for Stanford students.
However, we hear that the next recital might
well be planned for some place larger than the
little theater, where the first one was held.
