# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
WINTER CAMPUS CANDID
A red-headed soph sidestepping puddles on his way
to the libc, booking like a halfback dodging tacklers
. . . in contrast, a beanpole junior transfer, inspired
by a recent MGM musical, splashing through the
deepest puddles and Gene Kcllying "I'm Singing in
the Rain" ... a pretty dark-haired co-ed, her hair

drenched in a downpour, moan
ing, "And Til never be able to do
anything with it" . . . galoshes,
heavy boots, plastic raincoats,
umbrellas, and wet socks . . . the
time of year when the greatest
conversation piece of them all,
the weather, comes into sore
thumb prominence.
A pleasant Friday or Saturday
night spent at Stanford's match
box pavilion, watching powerful

George Zaninovich score with one of his broad jump
lay-ins or marveling at a swisher propelled from the
deft hands of catlike Ron Tomsic . . .
Rushing: the most intensively competitive intra
mural sport on the Farm . . . rushing: firm hand
shakes, toothpaste ad smiles, hot cider punch, more
smiles, showing of rooms, beers, trivial conversa
tion, smiles, pledge pins, firm handshakes, hell
week . . .
The rushee who went to one of the eating clubs
for dinner, discovering half-way through the meal

that he was in the wrong eating club, excusing him
self, barging in on dinner in the right club . . . one of
the fraternity-rushing chairmen making out like
Emily Post and addressing the brothers: "Lisscn, for
these few weeks, you guys gotta have table manners,
no reaching across the tabic, no hogging, and no
swearing, see. . .
The sweet, clean smell of the air on a clear winter
morning . . . ice-covered puddles, frosted glass,
and the mountains in the distance wearing a shawl
of snow.
The treks to the ski slopes . . . the Farm rough
up at Squaw Valley who remarked, "The only things
you can do up here are ski and drink, and I can't do
either" . . . the brunette junior girl, sporting $500
of Norwegian ski equipment and not being able to
negotiate the bunny slope without denting the land
scape every five yards . . . nylon ski parkas, peel
ing noses, handsome ski sweaters, chair lifts, rope
tows, sitzmarks, and autographed casts . , .
\ pair of freshmen standing at the shore of Lake
Lag, which is just beginning to expand its muscles,
and remarking, "Gee, do people really swim in that
stuff?" . . .
Firesides on a rainy evening ... a dance at the
Mark on a Saturday night . . . wet books, lines,
Cellar coffee, Chappies, all-night bull sessions at
Lommies, dull and interesting classes, dreary hours
in the libe, intra-mural basketball, partytime.
This is the Stanford that we are with all the time,
but never quite see, because it is so close.

in the libe, intra-mural basketball, partytime.
This is the Stanford that we are with all the time,
but never quite see, because it is so close.

WINTER CAMPUS CANDID
A red-headed soph sidestepping puddles on his way
to the libc, booking like a halfback dodging tacklers
. . . in contrast, a beanpole junior transfer, inspired
by a recent MGM musical, splashing through the
deepest puddles and Gene Kcllying "I'm Singing in
the Rain" ... a pretty dark-haired co-ed, her hair

drenched in a downpour, moan
ing, "And Til never be able to do
anything with it" . . . galoshes,
heavy boots, plastic raincoats,
umbrellas, and wet socks . . . the
time of year when the greatest
conversation piece of them all,
the weather, comes into sore
thumb prominence.
A pleasant Friday or Saturday
night spent at Stanford's match
box pavilion, watching powerful

George Zaninovich score with one of his broad jump
lay-ins or marveling at a swisher propelled from the
deft hands of catlike Ron Tomsic . . .
Rushing: the most intensively competitive intra
mural sport on the Farm . . . rushing: firm hand
shakes, toothpaste ad smiles, hot cider punch, more
smiles, showing of rooms, beers, trivial conversa
tion, smiles, pledge pins, firm handshakes, hell
week . . .
The rushee who went to one of the eating clubs
for dinner, discovering half-way through the meal

that he was in the wrong eating club, excusing him
self, barging in on dinner in the right club . . . one of
the fraternity-rushing chairmen making out like
Emily Post and addressing the brothers: "Lisscn, for
these few weeks, you guys gotta have table manners,
no reaching across the tabic, no hogging, and no
swearing, see. . .
The sweet, clean smell of the air on a clear winter
morning . . . ice-covered puddles, frosted glass,
and the mountains in the distance wearing a shawl
of snow.
The treks to the ski slopes . . . the Farm rough
up at Squaw Valley who remarked, "The only things
you can do up here are ski and drink, and I can't do
either" . . . the brunette junior girl, sporting $500
of Norwegian ski equipment and not being able to
negotiate the bunny slope without denting the land
scape every five yards . . . nylon ski parkas, peel
ing noses, handsome ski sweaters, chair lifts, rope
tows, sitzmarks, and autographed casts . , .
\ pair of freshmen standing at the shore of Lake
Lag, which is just beginning to expand its muscles,
and remarking, "Gee, do people really swim in that
stuff?" . . .
Firesides on a rainy evening ... a dance at the
Mark on a Saturday night . . . wet books, lines,
Cellar coffee, Chappies, all-night bull sessions at
Lommies, dull and interesting classes, dreary hours
in the libe, intra-mural basketball, partytime.
This is the Stanford that we are with all the time,
but never quite see, because it is so close.
