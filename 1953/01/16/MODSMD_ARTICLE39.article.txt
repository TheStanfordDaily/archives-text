## Naguib Says 'No Alliance' 
### 
CAIRO, Jan. 15 (UP)â€”Premier
Gen. Mohammed Naguib said today
Egypt never will join a Western al
liance for the defense of the Middle
East so long as British troops are in
the Suez Canal Zone.
Egypt will not even discuss a
Western alliance while "there arc
foreign troops on her territory," the
Egyptian strong man said. He said
bluntly that the world could not
blame Egyptians "if they lose their
patience" when he was asked about
a recent threat by a ranking aide
of a guerrilla war against the Brit
ish in Egypt.
Naguib's comment on British
troops in the Canal Zone and a
Western alliance came at a critical
juncture in Anglo - Egyptian nego
tiations.
It also came while the United
States was trying to devise a scheme
to fit Egypt into a Middle East de
fense organization with Greece,
Turkey, and other Arab countries.
The Angler - Egyptian Sudan has
made it plain that it wants complete
freedom, Naguib declared.
