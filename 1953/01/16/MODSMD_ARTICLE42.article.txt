### 
Despite a sensational first-round
knockout by Stanford's Norm Ma
noogian, the California boxing team
scored a 4 x /£-3Vfe victory in the Pa
vilion last night, due mainly to a
pair of Indian forfeits.
Manoogian, fighting in the
heavyweight class, kayocd Don
Wilson in 51 seconds. In two
classifications, 139- and 166-pound,
the Bears won when Stanford was
unable to produce an opponent,
and those two points were the dif
ference in the score. Stanford
won, V/z-ZVz, in matches actually
staged.
A second knockout, this a techni
cal one, was scored by Stanford's
Bob Baldocchi in the second round
over Floyd McFarland. A third In
dian victory came when Jack Owens
decisioned A 1 Dutra.
The results:
125—Phil Ishimaru (C) decision
over ROmeo Formentini, 2-1.

132 — Ken Hansen (C) decision
over Gary Sievert, 2-1.
139—California win by forfeit.
147 — Jack Owens (S) decision
over A 1 Dutra, 2-1.
155 —Eric Hansen and Don Ger
cich, dra\V.
166—California win by forfeit.
177 —Bob Baldocchi (S) TKO over
Floyd McFarland.
Heavyweight — Norm Manoogian
(S) KO over Don Wilson.
Stanford's wrestlers suffered a
23-12 setback in their second outing
of the season. The loss of a pair of
key players hurt the Indian matmen
considerably.
Steve Gee and Jim Hutchinson
were pinned in their matches. It
was the first match for both of
them though, so coach Don Wil
liams is not too disappointed. The
loss of George Russell and Phil
Wilson probably meant the difTer

ence in their respective matches.
Bruce Bailey, Ken James, and A 1
Colton were decisioned. Pat Mad
den won his match by a pin, and
Olie Lyons won by forfeit.
The Indians face San Jose next
week, when they hope to be at full
strength once more.

Stanford's wrestlers suffered a
23-12 setback in their second outing
of the season. The loss of a pair of
key players hurt the Indian matmen
considerably.
Steve Gee and Jim Hutchinson
were pinned in their matches. It
was the first match for both of
them though, so coach Don Wil
liams is not too disappointed. The
loss of George Russell and Phil
Wilson probably meant the difTer

ence in their respective matches.
Bruce Bailey, Ken James, and A 1
Colton were decisioned. Pat Mad
den won his match by a pin, and
Olie Lyons won by forfeit.
The Indians face San Jose next
week, when they hope to be at full
strength once more.
