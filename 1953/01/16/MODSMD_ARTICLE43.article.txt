# Unbeaten Braves, Frosh Play Pair This Weekend
## Lynn to Debut As Brave Mentor 
### DON STEPHENS 
Even with Coach George Lynn
making his debut and a current win
streak, the Braves will have to find
added incentive when they tangle
with two strong junior college teams
— Hartnell and Santa Rosa — this
week end in the Pavilion.
Lynn, replacing Army-hound Ed
Tucker, and his Varsity reserves
may find the victory inspiration in
Sam Morley, who has been scoring
with his formerly erratic eye.
Facing Hartnell in the opener to
day at 3 p.m., the high-scoring
Braves have garnered 74 points per
contest, while being even tighter on
defense—giving up 58 to opponents
in six winning games.
Footballer Morley, who notched 29
last week in a rough-and-tough
Stanford dual victory over the ex
perienced California Blues, is a cinch
to make the Varsity if he continues
his current scoring pace.
The starting lineup, as announced
by Lynn:
Paul Johnson, forward; Wayne
Culberson, center; Sam Morley, for
ward; Wayne Lockhart, guard; and
Bob Ogorek, guard.
