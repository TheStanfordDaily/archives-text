# Two-Platoon Fight Rages

### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 15 (UP)—Abo
lition of the two-platoon system split
college football's ranks wide open in
a raging controversy today and
evoked a demand in some quarters
for a one-year moratorium to prove
a transition from free to restricted
substitution.
A leading Midwest coach, who
asked that he not be identified, said
he would attempt to round up senti
ment from leading college authorities
in favor of a one-year delay of the
abandonment of two-platoon foot
ball.
The one-year transitional period
is necessary, he said, ''in fairness
to 1953 seniors, who never have
played anything hut two-platoon
football." The moratorium also
would give sophomores and jun
iors, who have been trained in
specialized football, a chance to
become accustomed to the more
rigorous requirements of restricted
substitution, he asserted. V
"This is the biggest bombshell to
hit college football in 50 years," the
coach maintained. "We need a one
year period to make the transition
from the old to the new."
Another coach prophesied that the
end of the two-platoon football
would send major colleges scurrying
in a hunt for "the old-type super
man 60-minute linemen that played
for teams like Minnesota, Pitt and
Fordham in the 1930'5."
He also forecast that restricted
substitution would bring about the
decline of the T-formation offensive
in favor of the single-wing. He
reasoned that two-way football play
ers would not be able to maintain
enough speed for 60 minutes to make
effective use of the T-attack.
