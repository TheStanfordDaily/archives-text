# Clegg's Freshmen Host High Schools
## 
### RUSS WILKS 
Dick Clegg's undefeated frosh bas
ketball team takes on a tough
Lowell High five tonight at 6 and
George Washington High tomorrow
afternoon at 4. Both games will be
played in the Pavilion.
Lowell poses a real threat to
the frosh's five-game unbeaten
streak. The Indians are rated as
the top team in the San Francisco
area. Having won their first two
league games, the Indians have a
strong first team in forwards A 1
Holder and Bob McGuhbin,
guards Mike Leaskou and Jerry
Jacoby and center "Goals" Gridcr.
Leaskou, a senior, is the play
maker, an uncanny passer and usu
ally tops in the scoring column.
Grider, who stands 6 feet 4'/2
inches, is strong on rebounding, as
is Jacoby. Lowell shoots well from
the outside and usually employs a
zone defense.
Coach Clegg expects a tough
but thinks the Frosh will win. He
doesn't anticipate any trouble from
George Washington Saturday.
The probable line-up for Stan
ford will have the ever-reliable
George Seljeck at guard along
with Ron Wagner, who made a
fine showing against Cal last
weekend. Denny Boren will play
the pivot, while Gunnar Chris
tiansen and Bill Flanders will be
up front.
Selleek is the team's top scorer
with 67 points, while Christiansen is
the most accurate from the floor
with a shooting percentage of 41 per
cent. The frosh as a team are aver
aging 65 points per game and have
a 37 per cent field goal percentage.
