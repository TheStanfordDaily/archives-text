Looking for a date activity a little more stimulating than movies
and drive-ins?
The new Morrison Planetarium in San Francisco's Golden Gate
Park offers a unique diversion. Performances are held every night
ai 8:15 except Mondays and Tuesdays.
And you don't have to be a full-fledged astronomer to enjoy

them. Any amateur star-gazer can
both understand and enjoy the lec
ture and visual effects of the plane
tarium.
For 74 cents (.'{(), if you're a
child) you can stroll into th«
planetarium theater, sink into one
of the soft seats arranged in a
circle beneath the planetarium
dome, and—as the lights dim—he
magically transported to the out
doors where a sky of brilliant stars
hangs overhead.
01' course, just what sky hangs
overhead depends upon the whim of
the lecturer who stands behind the
audience on a fenced-in rostrum
and manipulates an impressive
looking row of dials, levers, and
buttons. Willi the flick of a switch
he can transport you from one lati
tude to another or speed up the
transit of a planet across Jhe heav
ens (often to the amusement of the
spectators, since the effect is some
thing like that of an old Keystone
Cops movie).
This month the lectures are en
titled "Under the Southern Cross,"
as the star projector is set up to
show the skies of the Southern
Hemisphere. During February the
lectures will be on "Oui; Nearest
Neighbor, the Moon."
The effect of realism is the key
note of the planetarium. As the

room darkens and the glow of sun
set descends bolow the San Fran
cisco horizon constructed around
the base of the planetarium dome,
tiny spots of light, the "stars," are
projected onto the dome ceiling.
These spots of light resemble the
stars themselves to such an extent
that you think you actually feel the
chill of the cool night air.
The principle of star projection is
a simple one. A bright light, con
tained in a sphere which is placed
under the inside surface of a big
dome, shines through tiny openings
in the sphere to produce, by projec
tion, specks of light or "stars" on
the surface of the dome.
While the concept is simple, the
actual construction of a star pro
jector is no easy matter. The
3,8110 stars which may be projected
on the Morrison dome represent
cahincts-full of IBM computations
necessary to determine their cor
rect location and magnit ud e
(brightness) on the dome surface.
The dream of a planetarium be
gan with Dr. C. E. Grunsky, former
president of the California Academy
of Sciences, who became interested
in the idea as early as 1932.
When, during World War 11, the
Academy pushed aside its fossil col
lections and set up workshops to
make navigational instruments for
the Navy, the talk of Academy staff
members, as they conversed to ease
the tension of long hours of preci
sion work, invariably turned again
to planetariums, and more specifi

cally—a planetarium for San Fran
cisco.
The castle in the air suddenly
had iime foundations thrust un
der it when $200,(MM) wa< offered
from thee tale of Mrs. May Mor
rison under the condition that
the Academy hiiild a planetarium
to he named in honor of her late
husband. Alexander Morrison.
Other donations added $300,000
more to the sum and, with a cool
half million (a comparatively low
price for a planetarium) in hand,
the Academy set out to realize its
dream.
The original plan had been to ob
tain a star projector from the Zeis
optical works in Jena, Germany.
But the Zeiss plant had fallen into
Russian hands and could not fill the
order.
Could the men—both amateurs
and professionals—who had made
instruments for |he Navy under
take a task as huge and complex
as a star projector?
Excited consultations with ex
perts brought the answer "yes," and
in 1948 the trustees of the Academy
authorized them to go ahead on the
project.
At that time its builders
thought the projector would l»e
completed in about two years at
a cost of $75,000. It has taken four
years and has cost $140,000.
San Frarftisco riow boasts the first
major planetarium to be construct
ed entirely in America and, accord
ing to its director, Robert C. Miller,
"it is not excelled by any other in
the world."

chill of the cool night air.
The principle of star projection is
a simple one. A bright light, con
tained in a sphere which is placed
under the inside surface of a big
dome, shines through tiny openings
in the sphere to produce, by projec
tion, specks of light or "stars" on
the surface of the dome.
While the concept is simple, the
actual construction of a star pro
jector is no easy matter. The
3,8110 stars which may be projected
on the Morrison dome represent
cahincts-full of IBM computations
necessary to determine their cor
rect location and magnit ud e
(brightness) on the dome surface.
The dream of a planetarium be
gan with Dr. C. E. Grunsky, former
president of the California Academy
of Sciences, who became interested
in the idea as early as 1932.
When, during World War 11, the
Academy pushed aside its fossil col
lections and set up workshops to
make navigational instruments for
the Navy, the talk of Academy staff
members, as they conversed to ease
the tension of long hours of preci
sion work, invariably turned again
to planetariums, and more specifi

cally—a planetarium for San Fran
cisco.
The castle in the air suddenly
had iime foundations thrust un
der it when $200,(MM) wa< offered
from thee tale of Mrs. May Mor
rison under the condition that
the Academy hiiild a planetarium
to he named in honor of her late
husband. Alexander Morrison.
Other donations added $300,000
more to the sum and, with a cool
half million (a comparatively low
price for a planetarium) in hand,
the Academy set out to realize its
dream.
The original plan had been to ob
tain a star projector from the Zeis
optical works in Jena, Germany.
But the Zeiss plant had fallen into
Russian hands and could not fill the
order.
Could the men—both amateurs
and professionals—who had made
instruments for |he Navy under
take a task as huge and complex
as a star projector?
Excited consultations with ex
perts brought the answer "yes," and
in 1948 the trustees of the Academy
authorized them to go ahead on the
project.
At that time its builders
thought the projector would l»e
completed in about two years at
a cost of $75,000. It has taken four
years and has cost $140,000.
San Frarftisco riow boasts the first
major planetarium to be construct
ed entirely in America and, accord
ing to its director, Robert C. Miller,
"it is not excelled by any other in
the world."

the imposing star projector while waiting for the house lights to

The new Morrison Planetarium in San Francisco's Golden Gate
Park offers a unique diversion. Performances are held every night
ai 8:15 except Mondays and Tuesdays.
And you don't have to be a full-fledged astronomer to enjoy

them. Any amateur star-gazer can
both understand and enjoy the lec
ture and visual effects of the plane
tarium.
For 74 cents (.'{(), if you're a
child) you can stroll into th«
planetarium theater, sink into one
of the soft seats arranged in a
circle beneath the planetarium
dome, and—as the lights dim—he
magically transported to the out
doors where a sky of brilliant stars
hangs overhead.
01' course, just what sky hangs
overhead depends upon the whim of
the lecturer who stands behind the
audience on a fenced-in rostrum
and manipulates an impressive
looking row of dials, levers, and
buttons. Willi the flick of a switch
he can transport you from one lati
tude to another or speed up the
transit of a planet across Jhe heav
ens (often to the amusement of the
spectators, since the effect is some
thing like that of an old Keystone
Cops movie).
This month the lectures are en
titled "Under the Southern Cross,"
as the star projector is set up to
show the skies of the Southern
Hemisphere. During February the
lectures will be on "Oui; Nearest
Neighbor, the Moon."
The effect of realism is the key
note of the planetarium. As the

room darkens and the glow of sun
set descends bolow the San Fran

the base of the planetarium dome,

take a task as huge and complex
as a star projector?
Excited consultations with ex

in 1948 the trustees of the Academy
authorized them to go ahead on the
project.

thought the projector would l»e
completed in about two years at

years and has cost $140,000.

"it is not excelled by any other in

Looking for a date activity a little more stimulating than movies
and drive-ins?
The new Morrison Planetarium in San Francisco's Golden Gate
Park offers a unique diversion. Performances are held every night
ai 8:15 except Mondays and Tuesdays.
And you don't have to be a full-fledged astronomer to enjoy

them. Any amateur star-gazer can
both understand and enjoy the lec
ture and visual effects of the plane
tarium.
For 74 cents (.'{(), if you're a
child) you can stroll into th«
planetarium theater, sink into one
of the soft seats arranged in a
circle beneath the planetarium
dome, and—as the lights dim—he
magically transported to the out
doors where a sky of brilliant stars
hangs overhead.
01' course, just what sky hangs
overhead depends upon the whim of
the lecturer who stands behind the
audience on a fenced-in rostrum
and manipulates an impressive
looking row of dials, levers, and
buttons. Willi the flick of a switch
he can transport you from one lati
tude to another or speed up the
transit of a planet across Jhe heav
ens (often to the amusement of the
spectators, since the effect is some
thing like that of an old Keystone
Cops movie).
This month the lectures are en
titled "Under the Southern Cross,"
as the star projector is set up to
show the skies of the Southern
Hemisphere. During February the
lectures will be on "Oui; Nearest
Neighbor, the Moon."
The effect of realism is the key
note of the planetarium. As the

room darkens and the glow of sun
set descends bolow the San Fran
cisco horizon constructed around
the base of the planetarium dome,
tiny spots of light, the "stars," are
projected onto the dome ceiling.
These spots of light resemble the
stars themselves to such an extent
that you think you actually feel the
chill of the cool night air.
The principle of star projection is
a simple one. A bright light, con
tained in a sphere which is placed
under the inside surface of a big
dome, shines through tiny openings
in the sphere to produce, by projec
tion, specks of light or "stars" on
the surface of the dome.
While the concept is simple, the
actual construction of a star pro
jector is no easy matter. The
3,8110 stars which may be projected
on the Morrison dome represent
cahincts-full of IBM computations
necessary to determine their cor
rect location and magnit ud e
(brightness) on the dome surface.
The dream of a planetarium be
gan with Dr. C. E. Grunsky, former
president of the California Academy
of Sciences, who became interested
in the idea as early as 1932.
When, during World War 11, the
Academy pushed aside its fossil col
lections and set up workshops to
make navigational instruments for
the Navy, the talk of Academy staff
members, as they conversed to ease
the tension of long hours of preci
sion work, invariably turned again
to planetariums, and more specifi

cally—a planetarium for San Fran
cisco.
The castle in the air suddenly
had iime foundations thrust un
der it when $200,(MM) wa< offered
from thee tale of Mrs. May Mor
rison under the condition that
the Academy hiiild a planetarium
to he named in honor of her late
husband. Alexander Morrison.
Other donations added $300,000
more to the sum and, with a cool
half million (a comparatively low
price for a planetarium) in hand,
the Academy set out to realize its
dream.
The original plan had been to ob
tain a star projector from the Zeis
optical works in Jena, Germany.
