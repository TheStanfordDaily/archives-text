A DEEP FREEZE?—No, it's an IBM punch-card computer into
which Dr. Paul Morton, head of the Computing Laboratory, and
Leon Salanave, planetarium astronomer, are peering. The com
puter and other IBM machines were used for the tedious arith
metical work necessary to locate some 3,800 stars on projection
plates. Salanave was entrusted with the computation work.
Now on the planetarium staff, he shares lecturing duties with
George Bunton. —Photo by Elmer Moss
