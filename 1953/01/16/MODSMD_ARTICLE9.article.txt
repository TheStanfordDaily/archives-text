WASHINGTON. Jan. 15 (UP) -
President Truman told his country
men in a farewell address tonight
that his administration has brought
the nation to thcj threshold oi' inter
national peace and urged support
for President - elect Eisenhower in
finishing the job.
Mr. Truman expressed confidence
that historians will decide his re
gime set a course toward winning
the colli war.
"We have averted World War 111
up to now," he said, "and we may
already have succeeded in estab
lishing conditions which can keep
that war from happening as far
ahead as man can see."

Looking back, Mr. Truman said it
is "quite simple" to .say he lias not
tried lo end international strife by
dropping the atom bomb or making
all-out war.
"We are not made that way," he
said. "We are a moral people. Peace
is our goal, and justice and free
dom. "We cannot, of our own free
will, violate the very principles that
we are striving to defend."
Atomic war, he added, is "totally
unthinkable for rational men." The
"whole purpose" of his foreign poli
cies has been to'prevent World War
111, he said, and "starting a war is
no way to make peace."
