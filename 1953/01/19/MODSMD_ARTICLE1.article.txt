# Bruins, Referees Defeat Card Team In Weekend Thrillers, 67-66 and 74-71
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Defeats, two of the most pain-wracking, torturous defeats a Stan
ford hoop team has suffered, were the basketball bill of fare this
weekend as a fast-moving UCLA team edged past the Cards, 67
to 66 and 74 to 71.
Seldom has a weekend seen two games that followed the same

script so closely. Stanford left at
half-time with a narrow margin both
evenings, followed by a scoring boom
by UCLA in the second half, after
which camc a desperate last ditch
card rally which fell short. However,
Friday night's referceing left much
to be desired.
The Chronicle's Dick Friendlich,
one of tin- country's top basketball
writers, said lie had seldom seen
such poor officiating.
On Friday night, it was Bruins
Ron Bane and John Moore who
wrecked the Indians who wrecked
themselves. They took shots when
they shouldn't have and defensive


SHARPSHOOTER Stanford forward George Zaninovich sinks a field goal in Saturday's Bruin
game. Attempting to block him from behind is UCLA ace Don Bragg (56). Also in the picture is
Mike Hibler (35), as well as Indian players Don Carlson (18) and Russ Lawler (14). Though the
Cards were leading at this stage of the game by x points, the Westwood five came from behind
to win, 74-71. ' —Daily phot 9 by Fred Chez
mental lapses were too frequent.
Stanford led at the end of the hal
32 to 31. The third quarter was a
close as your next breath as the
lead changed hanus every 20 seconds
Then the Uclans forged ahead
and led hy eight points with only
two minutes and a half remaining.
The Cards cann* to lire, and deadly
Paul Johnson meshed two 20-foot
<push shots and George Zaninovich
and Olie SuzdalelT connected to
bring the Cards up to (>!> to 65.
But the referees blew their whistle
a few seconds later on Stanford
UCLA's Mark Costello sank both and
then with two seconds to go, George
Zaninovich was fouled. He sank the
first, missed the second, and Jim
Johnson hit on the follow to the end
of the game, GG to 67.
Stanford played much improved
ball Saturday, and again the issue
was in doubt to the very end. With
12 seconds to go, Woollen's team led,
72 to G9. Suzdeleff, the fiery guard
from San Francisco, had two free
shots coming, the second of which he
was instructed to miss.
The strategy was for one of the tall
men to tip it in to tie the
SuzdalelT made the first shot and
failed to miss the second to ice the
game for the Uclans.
Tin* games witnessed (he con
tinued improvement of sensational
George Zaninovich who dumped
in 18 points Friday night. Also,
talented Don Carlson won hack his
starting berth as a result of his
sterling liackhoard play.
Quick-reactioned Rom Tomsic con
tinued to lead the Indians in scoring
as he tallied 40 points during the
weekend. Russ Lawler, who seldom
shot but still connected for 15 points
on Saturday, played his best offen
sive game of the year on that par
ticular night.
The team leaves for Hawaii to
morrow morning where it will play
three games. One of the games will
be against Universal Motors, of which
last year's captain Jim Ramstead is
a member. Following is the travel

SWISH—Russ Lawler hooks in two more for the Indians Satur
day night despite the efforts of two Bruin defenders, Don Bragg
and Barry Porter to stop him.
Defeats, two of the most pain-wracking, torturous defeats a Stan
ford hoop team has suffered, were the basketball bill of fare this
weekend as a fast-moving UCLA team edged past the Cards, 67
to 66 and 74 to 71.
Seldom has a weekend seen two games that followed the same

script so closely. Stanford left at
half-time with a narrow margin both
evenings, followed by a scoring boom
by UCLA in the second half, after
which camc a desperate last ditch
card rally which fell short. However,
Friday night's referceing left much
to be desired.

such poor officiating.

SWISH—Russ Lawler hooks in two more for the Indians Satur
day night despite the efforts of two Bruin defenders, Don Bragg
and Barry Porter to stop him.
Defeats, two of the most pain-wracking, torturous defeats a Stan
ford hoop team has suffered, were the basketball bill of fare this
weekend as a fast-moving UCLA team edged past the Cards, 67
to 66 and 74 to 71.
Seldom has a weekend seen two games that followed the same

script so closely. Stanford left at
half-time with a narrow margin both
evenings, followed by a scoring boom
by UCLA in the second half, after
which camc a desperate last ditch
card rally which fell short. However,
Friday night's referceing left much
to be desired.
The Chronicle's Dick Friendlich,
one of tin- country's top basketball
writers, said lie had seldom seen
such poor officiating.
On Friday night, it was Bruins
Ron Bane and John Moore who
wrecked the Indians who wrecked
themselves. They took shots when
they shouldn't have and defensive


SHARPSHOOTER Stanford forward George Zaninovich sinks a field goal in Saturday's Bruin
game. Attempting to block him from behind is UCLA ace Don Bragg (56). Also in the picture is
Mike Hibler (35), as well as Indian players Don Carlson (18) and Russ Lawler (14). Though the
Cards were leading at this stage of the game by x points, the Westwood five came from behind
to win, 74-71. ' —Daily phot 9 by Fred Chez
