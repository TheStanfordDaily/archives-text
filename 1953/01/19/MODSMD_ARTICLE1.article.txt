# Bruins, Referees Defeat Card Team In Weekend Thrillers, 67-66 and 74-71

### PETE GROTHE 
Defeats, two of the most pain-wracking, torturous defeats a Stan
ford hoop team has suffered, were the basketball bill of fare this
weekend as a fast-moving UCLA team edged past the Cards, 67
to 66 and 74 to 71.
Seldom has a weekend seen two games that followed the same

script so closely. Stanford left at
half-time with a narrow margin both
evenings, followed by a scoring boom
by UCLA in the second half, after
which camc a desperate last ditch
card rally which fell short. However,
Friday night's referceing left much
to be desired.
The Chronicle's Dick Friendlich,
one of tin- country's top basketball
writers, said lie had seldom seen
such poor officiating.
On Friday night, it was Bruins
Ron Bane and John Moore who
wrecked the Indians who wrecked
themselves. They took shots when
they shouldn't have and defensive

game. Attempting to block him from behind is UCLA ace Don Bragg (56). Also in the picture is
Mike Hibler (35), as well as Indian players Don Carlson (18) and Russ Lawler (14). Though the
Cards were leading at this stage of the game by x points, the Westwood five came from behind
to win, 74-71. ' —Daily phot 9 by Fred Chez
