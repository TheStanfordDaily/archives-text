# Communists Start Jewish Purge
## 
### 
BERLIN, Jan. 18—(UP)—Flying squads of Communist police
hunting "Zionist spies" swooped down on the homes and offices of
Jews throughout East Germany today, seized papers and identity
cards, and ordered the Jews to stay close to home.
Jewish and non-Jewish refugees brought word of the raids which

were reported 10 nave reacnen into
virtually every East German home
of the 2,800 survivors of Nazi exter
mination camps.
Western authorities said the 2,000
Jews in East Berlin and 800 in the
Soviet zone of Germany faced a
threat of arrest at any time, al
though none was known to have
been seized today.
Almost all of # them, officials
said, have been helped by the
American Joint Distribution Com
mittee, labeled by the Reds a spy
outfit. The organization was ac
cused in the Moscow arrest of
nine Kremlin doctors last week—
six of them Jews. '
Western authorities said the Jews
in the East were at the mercy of the
Communists, because most were too
old or too ill to flee. They were said
to be aged and invalid survivors of
Nazi concentration camps, living on
small pensions granted them as vic
tims of Fascism.
The broadside raids took place as
Hans Jendretzky, East Berlin Com
munist leader and Central Commit
tee member, issued a virtual de
mand for the exclusion of Jews from
public life. He called them enemies
of the state. *
The anti-Semitic campaign co
incided with Communist prepara
tions to £ry Foreign Minister
Georg Derringer as a "Western
spy," along with five of his top
aides. Three of them are Jews. A
mounting purge engulfed other
Communist and non - Communist
officials.
The anti - Semitic campaign was
spreading throughout Eastern Eu
rope. Only yesterday Communist
Hungary announced the arrest of
Lajos StoecJjler, -president of the
country's Jewish national commu
nity. The campaign first was mani
fested at the Prague trial of 14
former Communist leaders, most of
them Jews.
