# Taft Enters Wilson Fight
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 (UP) â€”
Sen. Robert A. Taft said today it is
up to President-elect Eisenhower's
advisers to propose a change in fed
eral law that would permit Charles
E. Wilson to become Defense Secre
tary without giving up his stock
holdings.
The statement by the powerful
Senate Republican leader meant
that Herbert Brownell, Jr., incoming
Attorney General, had been tossed
the politically hot question which
already has killed plans to swear in
all of Eisenhower's cabinet when he
takes office Tuesday.
"It's up to them to come up with
a suggested change in the law, an
amendment or a new statute," Taft
said.
Brownell spent the weekend
studying the federal law which car
ries fines and jail sentences for any
government official doing business
with a firm in which he is interested
"directly or indirectly." He will re
port his findings to the Senate
Armed Services Committee.
The committee, which questioned
Wilson last week and temporarily
sidetracked his nomination, has
granted his request for another
hearing Wednesday. The committee
also has delayed action on Eisen
hower's appointments for Secre
taries of Army, Air, and Navy and
Deputy Defense Secretary.
