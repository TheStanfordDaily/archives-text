# A
						Deserving Passenger Is 'Bumped'

Tomorrow the Director of Athletics of Stan
ford University is leaving on a trip to Hawaii
—with the basketball team. And the senior stu
dent manager of the basketball team is not
going.
• This is the usual procedure—according to the
Stanford Athletic Code. For whenever a Stan
ford athletic team leaves the continental limits
of the United States, the student manager is
not "guaranteed" a place with the team arid his
place is generally taken by some member of
the Athletic Department. So A 1 Masters is go
ing to Hawaii.
This may be the usual procedure—hut we
agree with the writers of the Campus Opinion
below. We feel the student manage/ is qet
tincj "robbed' of what would be his privilege
were the trip to the East.
The explanation by Mr. Masters and the Ad
ministration is simple. The Athletic Code is
stated. And it also seems that some of the
alumni in Hawaii have reguested that theAthle
tic Director come over. A group of Hawaiians
are paying the way of the 12 persons to make
the trip —and that includes just ten players,
one coach, and another—in this case, Mr.
Masters.
What us is what the difference is
between Hawaii and Kansas City? For a year
ago Christmas, the basketball team went to
Kansas City taking it's complement of 12 which
included the senior manager. And similarly,
why is it any more desirable to have a member
of the athletic staff with the team in Hawaii than
it might be in Ann Arbor where the football
team made a recent trip?
Furthermore, if the alumni are making the
request, why doesn't the University foot the
bill? For it is the practice of the University
to pay the transportation fees of University
personnel to alumni conferences and the like
—and this might well fall under that classifi
cation. *
The senior student manager has a rather
thankless job—even as the Campus Opinion

mentions below, he is rather an unsung hero
of the athletic system since he doesn't get the
glory received by a player. Be the sport foot
ball or basketball, the manager's reward is
the one major trip taken by the players—and
this is the only major basketball trip this year.
Despite the Stanford Athletic Code, we think
the University could send over the student
manager to Hawaii as guaranteed by the Hawaii
group —and pay Mr. Masters' way. At any rate,
Mr. Masters might have had the consideration
to inform the student manager of this situation
at the beginning of the year instead of last
week. If you agree, why not express your
opinion to the Administration—today.
The Director of Athletics gained guite a bit
of student commendation when he allowed that
the men's gym be opened on Sundays, but we
dare say his present act won.it be received as
favorably. We hope the alumni appreciate the
fact that in their reguest, they're "bumping" a
deserving passenger off the plane to Hawaii.
