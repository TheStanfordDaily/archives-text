# Hearing for Gripes
## 
### 
If you belong to one of Stanford's many or
ganizations, you'll be asked this week to make
suggestions on this year's Student Workshop.
From our experience with past years' work
shops, we've found that they're an excellent
opportunity for airing gripes and coming up
with some pretty good solutions to campus
problems.
The ideas that come out of the workshop go
back to the groups involved, and in the past
have resulted in everything from Drives Com
to an Activities Booklet.
The Workshop Committee has already sent
out letters asking for lists of discussion topics,
so if you feel that Pom-Pom Com should be
dispensed with or that window boxes should
be attached to Hoover Tower, send the sug
gestion in.
