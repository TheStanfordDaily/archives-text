# BULL SESSION

### DICK MANSFIELD 
When the Frosh went down on the Row last week
for fraternity open houses—and, according to sensa
tional Daily news stories, women's residence open
house people showed up in all kinds of clothes.
There were the boys who went formal and wore reas
onably white .shirts, and there were those who went

casual and wore sweaters but
no shirt at all. Some of the
brothers dug out the tweeds,
and others the genuine made
in-Boston Hawaiian shirts.
With all this confusion on the
Row, tlu- time has come for a
guide to campus fashions in
men's wear, What The Well-
Dressed Rough Is Draped In.
or (conversely) How to Tell
The Well Dressed Rough from
a Common Slob.

Break it down by the importance of the event. Events
on campus range from Civ lectures to wakes, and thus
may be described as a sort of circle. Proper dress for
a Civ lecture, of course, includes Stanford jacket and
levis and, if you sit in the balcony, a pillow. For a
v/ake, the same with black sox.
Occasionally you hear of an event to which "Quad
Clothes" are to be worn. Right now, quad clothes
means Civ lecture clothes plus a slicker, tall shoes,
!»ig hat. And don't wear your Sunday levis—they
don't stand up well in mud holes.
For social gatherings such as Main Libe study
breaks, Civ lecture clothes minus the Stanford jacket,

and perhaps the addition of a blazer with daring
mottoes on the front or even (if it is a formal Study
Break, with muttered invitations) a shirt. Any Rough
'who wears tie or sweater to a study break is con
sidered a Slob.
Informal dances are a booby-trap for the Rough
Any Rough who prances into an informal dance
dressed informally will feel lonely. The story for
informal dances is to go all the w$v —flannels,
rakish coat, knit tie, white bucks,.bogus, chrysanthe
mum. Or even iust a suit—any color or combination
of colors. Outdazzle Your Date! But neither go
informal nor be comfortable at an informal dance.
This is considered gauche and strictly for the peas
ants.
Don't let a formal dance worry you. Wear anything
but Civ lecture clothes. If you have a top hat, white
tie, and sash, you'll knock 'em dead. But dead. Al
most the same effect can be had in a zoot suit. You
may not rate with your date (who wants to rat with
his date? Bah) but you will be sure to be a hero
with the boys.
For basketball games, labs, dog fights, or coffee
dates, back to the Civ lecture ensemble. Always stay
calm. Clothes, said the bard, make the man. and Civ
lecture clothes make the Stanford Rough. Aha, says
the freshman philosopher, and Civ lectures make the
Stanford Rough. Keep it in mind and repeat it over
and over it goes well to music and soon you will
acquire a reputation as some one whose wit is equalled
only by his taste in clothes.
