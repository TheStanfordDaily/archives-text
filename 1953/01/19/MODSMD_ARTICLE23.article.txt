Take Haines Along
To the Editor:
A rule of the Stanford Athletic code slates that only
twelve Stanford participants may travel out of the
country to participate in any basketball game. Be
cause of this ruling, manager Charley Haines is not
being permitted to leave with the team for Hawaii.
Ten team members and coach Burnett are being
joined by A1 Masters, who last week informed Haines
that he was going in his place.
While Mr. Masters undoubtedly deserves this brief
rest, we, the Stanford team, feel that one of Stanford's
unsung heroes, Charley Haines (who knows,nothing
of this letter) is getting robbed of one of the few
rewards his tedious, yet vital job brings.
The team will readily testify that no one deserves
this trip more than Haines. He works two to four
hours daily, and often a full eight hour day when the
team is on the road.
We urge Mr. Masters to allow thirteen passengers
to make the trip this one time. «

To the Editor:
The illusion of student apathy has been broken!
Many organizations have been cautious about spon
soring Reg. dances because they feared the lack of
student support in attendance.
We of Co-Rec believed that casual, all campus
dances were desired by many, and we set about to
find out.
Under the new ASSU ruling, Reg. dances are now
held on the first Saturday night following registration
day in order" to allow the sponsors more time to
organize a better dance and the students more time to
arrange dates.
Now that "Winter Whirl" is over,'our $400.00 profit
is proof that the additional time was helpful, that Reg.
dances such as ours can be a success, and that they
are wanted by the students.
Many thanks to all the wonderful people whose co
operation help put "Winter Whirl" over.
