# '1984' Seen Near in China
## 
### BARBARA TUERK Daily Feature Editor 
"1984" is too close for com
fort.
Certainly, Orwell's Big Broth
er is little more efficient than
Communist China's police sys
tem, as described by A. Doak
Barnett, prominent Far Eastern
authority, who will speak at
Cubberley Auditorium on Wed
nesday.
Tin* American Universities Field
Staff member told a Hoover Library
seminar last week that, "Effective
organized opposition within China
to the Communist regime is possible
only if there is a split or weaken
ing in the central core of the party."
Barnett lias just returned to
this country after a year and
a half in Hong Kong, where he
was able to hear first-hand the
experiences of many Chinese who
had just escaped from behind the
Bamboo Curtain.
He described a police and propa
ganda system of almost unbeliev
able efficiency, which has direct
control over the thoughts and ac
tions of almost every one of the
475,000,000 Chinese.
Speaking quickly, quietly, author
itatively, Barnett listed a few of the
many forms of control:
I. Spy system.
"In every city and village," Bar
nett declared, "the local police,
neighborhood groups, and volun
tary spies have been organized to
'help' the people keep track of
each other's 'reactionary tenden
cies'."
2. Indoctrination in small study
groups.
"Millions of Chinese have been
forced to attend .small study groups
which meet daily to 'discuss' Marx
ist theory," he said. A leader
hands out propaganda, which the
group discusses until every possible
point of disagreement has been
thoroughly rebutted.
"Everyone must participant ac
tively and express his honest opin
ion until his opinion is the same as
the first piece of information. The
social pressure exerted is tremen
dous.
"Everyone knows what he is sup
posed to think. If he can't dispose
ol his objections, he knows he's a

bourgeois thinker. Always in the
background there is the threat of
punishment ii he cannot purge him
self of nonconformist ideas."
3. Propaganda.
"The Communists make no
apology for using all agencies of
communication only to get gov
ernment ideas across to the peo
ple," Burnett explained. "More
over, they've branched into such
unorthodox media as farmers' al
manacs, traditional opera, story
telling, and industrial products.
"I remember seeing one pair of
garters inscribed: 'Aid Korea and
Oppose America'."
"Their aim is to organize 1 per
cent of the population into a net
work of agitators, who spread the
Communist line in day-to-day con
versation," he added. " 'Replace
family gossip with talks on current
affairs,' is the new slogan."
4. Political workers.
"The Communists have bridged
the gap between intellectuals and
peasantry as no other Asian gov

ernments have," said Harnett, who
was born and \ brought up in
Shanghai. "Carefully trained and
enthusiastic young intellectuals
work directly with the masses to
implement party and government
policies."
5. Mass organization.
"These political workers have or
ganized a large majority of the pop
ulation into one or another mass as
sociation," he declared. "Through
such groups as the peasant federa
tions and the women's and children's
associations, any decision from the
top can be carried out immediately
all through the country."
Barnett's Cubberley speech will
be on "The Impact of the Commu
nist Revolution on China." It will
be given at 4 p.m. and will be open
to the public.
