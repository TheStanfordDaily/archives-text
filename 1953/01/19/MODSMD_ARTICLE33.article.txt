## Stanford Ruggers Practice As Season Nears; Opener Jan. 31 
### JACK RANNELLS 
Anyone near the men's gym these afternoons might think that
Chuck Taylor is sneaking the Stanford football team out for early
spring practice sessions. In reality, however, it is simply Coach
Pete Kmetovic's Stanford rugby squad working out for the 1953
season. The mistaken identity would be a logical one, though,

as a look at the rugger' roster will
tell you.
There aren't many football
coaches who couldn't use a team
comprised of Jack Bonetti and Ron
liush at ends, A 1 Kirkland and
John Stanton at the tackle spots,
Paul Revak and Dick Borda at
guards, A 1 Banner or Ted Tanner
at center, and a hackfield of Ron
Cook, Bill Rogers, Jim Stewart, and
Jarvis Watson. That is, many
coaches of American football.
However, almost every one of these
gridders will have to scramble for his
position as one of the starting fif
teen on Stanford's 1953 rugby squad.
Their competition will come from less
well-known footballers like Don
Mueller, Howard Standifer, and Mike
Anderson, and from a host of hefty
but speedy Frosh, graduates, and
foreign students.
Among the most promising of
these are: Joel Sappenfield. most
valuable freshman footballer of the
19.12 season; Bill Tarr and Bob
Long of the frosh squad; Marty
Feldman, a grad student who was

selected on the All-Time Stanford
Rugby Team in "Great Moments
in Stanford Sports."
Bill Howard, who played the game
at Oxford, Pierre Dupasquier from
France, and Bill McMahon with
Canadian rugby experience, are the
outstanding foreign prospects.
Another late, but welcome, addi
tion to the squad was that of Fletcher
Metten, who did all of the conver
sion and penalty kicking last season.
Practices are held on the rugby
field every Monday, Wednesday, and
Thursday, at 4:15. Anyone interested
in playing this season should either
come out to practice or. preferably,
get in contact with Kmetovic at the
BAC as soon as possible.
The tentative schedule calls for an
intra-squad game on Saturday, Jan.
24, and a Varsity contest with the
San Francisco Olympic Club and JV
contest with the Palo Alto Ramblers
on the following Saturday, Jan. 31,
as the season's initiaters.

Canadian rugby experience, are the
outstanding foreign prospects.
Another late, but welcome, addi
tion to the squad was that of Fletcher
Metten, who did all of the conver
sion and penalty kicking last season.
Practices are held on the rugby
field every Monday, Wednesday, and
Thursday, at 4:15. Anyone interested
in playing this season should either
come out to practice or. preferably,
get in contact with Kmetovic at the
BAC as soon as possible.
The tentative schedule calls for an
intra-squad game on Saturday, Jan.
24, and a Varsity contest with the
San Francisco Olympic Club and JV
contest with the Palo Alto Ramblers
on the following Saturday, Jan. 31,
as the season's initiaters.
Anyone near the men's gym these afternoons might think that
Chuck Taylor is sneaking the Stanford football team out for early
spring practice sessions. In reality, however, it is simply Coach
Pete Kmetovic's Stanford rugby squad working out for the 1953
season. The mistaken identity would be a logical one, though,

as a look at the rugger' roster will
tell you.
There aren't many football
coaches who couldn't use a team
comprised of Jack Bonetti and Ron
liush at ends, A 1 Kirkland and
John Stanton at the tackle spots,
Paul Revak and Dick Borda at
guards, A 1 Banner or Ted Tanner
at center, and a hackfield of Ron
Cook, Bill Rogers, Jim Stewart, and
Jarvis Watson. That is, many
coaches of American football.
However, almost every one of these
gridders will have to scramble for his
position as one of the starting fif
teen on Stanford's 1953 rugby squad.
Their competition will come from less
well-known footballers like Don
Mueller, Howard Standifer, and Mike
Anderson, and from a host of hefty
but speedy Frosh, graduates, and
foreign students.
Among the most promising of
these are: Joel Sappenfield. most
valuable freshman footballer of the
19.12 season; Bill Tarr and Bob
Long of the frosh squad; Marty
Feldman, a grad student who was

selected on the All-Time Stanford
Rugby Team in "Great Moments
in Stanford Sports."
Bill Howard, who played the game
at Oxford, Pierre Dupasquier from
France, and Bill McMahon with
Canadian rugby experience, are the
outstanding foreign prospects.
