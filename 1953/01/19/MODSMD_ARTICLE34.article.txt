NEVER TOUCHED MEâ€”Norm Manoogian, Stanford boxer and
Ail-American guard in football, claps his hands happily after his
sensational amateur boxing debut in which he KOed California's
Don Wilson in 51 seconds o* the first round. Manoogian has
been bothered all year with a bad knee which kept him out of
football. Commented Wilson: "I should have hit him in the
knee. That's his only weak spot.".
