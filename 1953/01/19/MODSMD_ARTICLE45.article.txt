# A 						Phi 0 Installs New Daily Boxes; Palm Drive Shelter Plans Postponed
## 
### 
Completing another service pro
ject of Alpha Phi Omega, three more
Stanford Daily boxes will be in
stalled on the campus todayâ€”at the
Post Office, the Cellar, and the Busi
ness School on Quad,
The boxes, similar to those now on
the four Quad corners and at the
Eating Clubs, were made as a pledge
project of the service fraternity. All
costs of the construction and instal
lation are being financed from un

claimed Book Exchange money.
A report on the current projects of
A Phi O was given to the fraternity
in a meeting yesterday afternoon.
The fraternity learned that no work
could yet be done on the proposed
shelter at the head of Palm Drive as
the plans for the project were still
being developed by the University
Planning Office. The idea was first
submitted to the University last No
vember.
