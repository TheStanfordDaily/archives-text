# Luboshutz and Nemenoff Concert Fresh, Unusual
## 
### RON ROSEN 
In a program distinguished for its unusualness and freshness,
the two-piano magic of Luboshutz and Nemenoff thoroughly cap
tivated a large audience in Memorial Auditorium last Friday night.
Not only were the performances themselves outstanding, but
ihe compositions presented wore those seldom encountered in

the standard concert fare.
The delicacy and beautiful bal
ance with which these dun-pian
ists played in the opening Mo/.arl
Sonata in I) Major was truly
amazing, considering the tendency
for two pianos to become thick
and heavy in sound. One was al
ways conscious of the melody line;
(lie accompaniments were well
subordinated at all times by both
pianists.
The seldom - heard Introduction,
Passacaglia, and Fugue by Max He
ger, although heavily padded with
thick harmonies and reminiscent of
Brahms and Mahler, proved to he
a magnificent work. Its immense
difficulties and brooding moodiness
were handled with the utmost un
derstanding s»nd skill, and make one
wish that he might hear more of
this great Romantic's compositions.

♦
On first hearing the Suite from
i "On Stage" by Norman Hello
Joio, it struck this reviewer that
no one since Gershwin has so
genuinely reflected the spirit of
New York and Broadway as this
young American has in bis music.
The varying moods of a great city
are captured in this composition,
which was given a top-flight per
formance.
The subtle and elusive colorings
in Debussy's "Lindajara," with its
mystic and fragrant Spanish atmos
phere, left the audience completely
spellbound.
The concluding fantasy from "Die
Flcdcrmaus" elicit.cd prolonged ap-
I plau.se and the excellent team rc-
I sponded with a generous bracc of
, | encores.
