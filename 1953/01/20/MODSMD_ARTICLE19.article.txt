# Electronic 'Brain' Center Planned For Early March
## 
### 
A Computation Center equipped
with electronic "brains" foi work
ing put knotty calculating problems
is scheduled to be started at Stan
ford in early March.
The Center's high - speed eler
tronic calculating machine will give
faculty researchers a hand with
large computation jobs which would
take too long to work out with desk
calculators. The machine is an IBM
card - programmed calculatot whw-h
gets itr, instructions from punched
cards that are fed into it.
Formation of the Center is a joint
project of the Electronics Research
and the ApplieH Mathematics, and
Statistics laboratories. It will be lo
cated in the Radio Propagation Lab
oratory building.
Professor John G. Herriot, of the
Mathematics Department, will di
rect the new Center.
In addition to its use in connec
tion with research, the Center will
be an aid to teaching. Interested
students will have an opportunity
to learn the techniques of high
speed computing. Since this is a
rapidly expanding field, job oppor
tunities for persons with such train
ing are numerous.
