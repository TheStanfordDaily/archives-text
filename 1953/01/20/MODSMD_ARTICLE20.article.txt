Much of the day was spent pack
ing personal belongings for the trip
to Independence, Missouri. The
President told reporters he was
having a "busier" day than usual.
"If you fellows need a job, 1
can put you to work," he quipped
good-naturedly.
But the President was less than
enthusiastic about the unpacking he
will have to do back home.
"I have plenty of help in doing
the packing," he told newsmen.
"But the boss (Mrs. Truman) says
I have to unpack them."
At a regular morning confer
ence with top members of the
White House staff, he presented
each with a large autographed
color picture of himself.
He then rode in his limousine to a
nearby bank to straighten out his
personal finances. It was only his
second ti ip t,o the batik since be
coming President, the first being
shortly after he was sworn into of
fice in April, 1945.
Mr. Truman had no official call
ers and climaxed the day with a
quiet family dinner in the Whilte
House with Mrs. Truman and
daughter Margaret.
