# Valuables Stolen At Open Houses
## 
### 
Several fraternities reported this
weekend that money and other val-
uables had been stolen from wal-
lets in upstairs rooms during last
week's rushing open houses.
Police Chief Gordon Davis said
that open house thefts had not been
reported for everal years. The cul-
prits, he said, would be difficult to
find, because of the hundreds of
people circulating through the
houses during those hours.
Among the houses which suffered
losses were the Theta Delts, the
DU's, the Sigma Chi's, and the Phi
Delts.
