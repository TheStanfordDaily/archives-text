# Truman
## 
### 
Eight years ago come April a little man
named Harry S. Truman put his hand on a copy
of the Holy Bible and was sworn in as President
of the United States.
Today another man takes his place, and
Hairy S. Truman goes back to Independence,
Missouri.
It's been an amazing eight years. Truman
himself is concerned about the place they'll
hold in the history books. We wonder, too. Will
historians in 2052 vindicate his acts and record
him as a great president? Or will they put him
down as a corrupt, incompetent blunderer, who
led his country well along the road to destruc
tion?
Probably neither. Probably the historians
will put him somewhere in the middle—will
give him credit for some great deeds and con
demn him lor some major failures.
Right now we're probably too close to tell.
Certainly our world today is a topsy-turvy
one compared to the one in which Hairy Tru
man took olfice.
Go back eight years. The words "atom
bomb" didn't mean much to anyone but a hand
ful of physicists and a few highly informed of
ficials. Russia, China were both our allies.
Germany, Japan were our eneunies. The great
domestic fear was that depression would follow
on the heels of the war.
Now we talk of "H" bombs and beyond. We
fear Russia and China. Germany and Japan are
regaining their arms and we look to thern as our
main hope in Europe and Asia. The battle on the
home front is against inflation.
It is especially difficult to know how his
toiians will deal with the foreign policy ol the
Tinman Administration. From our current
vantage jXDint, it is easy to condemn Truman

lor his concessions to the Russians at Pots
darn, haid to remember that they were then
our allies. It is easy to call the loss of China
a "tragic blunder," hard to remember that we
had no apparent choice other than to side 1 with
either the far left or the far right.
Undoubtedly history will record Truman as
the man who ordered the first use of the atom
bomb. And only history can tell if his order
will prove to be for the ultimate humanitarian
good.
Historians will not be able to avoid the fact
that while Truman was in office, Communism
made huge gains throughout the world, that his
policy of "containment' was for the most part
unsuccessful.
But on a kinder note, the humanitarianism
of these last eight years will be long remem
bered. For the lirst time in history, a strong
nation engaged in large scale philanthropy
for motives which were for a large part altru
istic. Billions ol dollars of aid for the starving
and the homeless in many lands may do
much to earn the man from Missouri a warm
place in the hearts of future school children.
Domestic records may be less generous.
Harry Vaughans. Mink coats. Graft in the
Bureau of Internal Revenue. Letters insulting
music critics and the U.S. Marine Corps. Hints
at racial prejudice in political campaigning. A
dozen tactless, undignified remarks.
But perhaps people in the future will also
remember that he fought for civil rights and
greater social benefits in spite of a lack of sup
port even in his own party.
How does it all add up? Neither black nor
white. But we'd certainly like to see a history
book written about a 100 years from now.

Undoubtedly history will record Truman as
the man who ordered the first use of the atom
bomb. And only history can tell if his order
will prove to be for the ultimate humanitarian
good.
Historians will not be able to avoid the fact
that while Truman was in office, Communism
made huge gains throughout the world, that his
policy of "containment' was for the most part
unsuccessful.
But on a kinder note, the humanitarianism
of these last eight years will be long remem
bered. For the lirst time in history, a strong
nation engaged in large scale philanthropy
for motives which were for a large part altru
istic. Billions ol dollars of aid for the starving
and the homeless in many lands may do
much to earn the man from Missouri a warm
place in the hearts of future school children.
Domestic records may be less generous.
Harry Vaughans. Mink coats. Graft in the

at racial prejudice in political campaigning. A

But perhaps people in the future will also
remember that he fought for civil rights and
greater social benefits in spite of a lack of sup
port even in his own party.
How does it all add up? Neither black nor

book written about a 100 years from now.
Eight years ago come April a little man
named Harry S. Truman put his hand on a copy
of the Holy Bible and was sworn in as President
of the United States.
Today another man takes his place, and
Hairy S. Truman goes back to Independence,
Missouri.
It's been an amazing eight years. Truman
himself is concerned about the place they'll
hold in the history books. We wonder, too. Will
historians in 2052 vindicate his acts and record
him as a great president? Or will they put him
down as a corrupt, incompetent blunderer, who
led his country well along the road to destruc
tion?
Probably neither. Probably the historians
will put him somewhere in the middle—will
give him credit for some great deeds and con
demn him lor some major failures.
Right now we're probably too close to tell.
Certainly our world today is a topsy-turvy
one compared to the one in which Hairy Tru
man took olfice.
Go back eight years. The words "atom
bomb" didn't mean much to anyone but a hand
ful of physicists and a few highly informed of
ficials. Russia, China were both our allies.
Germany, Japan were our eneunies. The great
domestic fear was that depression would follow
on the heels of the war.
Now we talk of "H" bombs and beyond. We
fear Russia and China. Germany and Japan are
regaining their arms and we look to thern as our
main hope in Europe and Asia. The battle on the
home front is against inflation.
It is especially difficult to know how his
toiians will deal with the foreign policy ol the
Tinman Administration. From our current
vantage jXDint, it is easy to condemn Truman

lor his concessions to the Russians at Pots
darn, haid to remember that they were then
our allies. It is easy to call the loss of China
a "tragic blunder," hard to remember that we
had no apparent choice other than to side 1 with
either the far left or the far right.
