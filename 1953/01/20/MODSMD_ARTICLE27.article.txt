(Editor's note: Miss Elva Brown, Chief Counselor
for Women, writes in the following column about
the status of women in an upset world. Her column
follows one last week hy Eugene Dils of the Place
ment. Service on how the draft effects men.)
Tlie present crisis affects the college woman, too.
On the university campus, the draft with its
accompanying critical problems for the student and
hi: family, for education, for business and industry
has made us keenly aware of the effect of the present
crisis on the liveft of our college men. Not as aware,
however, are we apt to be of the effect of the same
• j . i • ii i: r .. -11 . >-v •< *■. v •

Uuation on the lives of collegc
women. Yet, it is far reaching anc
hould not be dismissed lightly
In one of the recent bulletins o
the U.S. Office of Education the
assumption "that practically even
able-bodied male college studerr
will be called upon for service
military or civilian, during this
generation" is followed by the
■ tatement "that the educational
vocational, and personal plans ol

practically every woman college student likewise will
be affected in one way or another by the needs ol the
deft nse period."
Several "signs of the times" indicate ways in which
the college woman is affected. One sign can be found
in such cold, hard statistics as that women now out
number the men, making up 52% of the population;
that 2()'/a million civilian women are employed today;
and, that there is some evidence that women control
a much of the capital of the United States as the men,
and perhaps more. Another sjgn is seen in the field
of politics..
During the 1952 national elections, women re
ceived more attention from both the major parties
than ever before, and from present indications ap
parently are gaining greater influence in party
p« lilies. In the field of economics, business and in
dustry are definitely out to attract women in greater
numbers than heretofore, while both unions in last
year's conventions issued statements favorable to
women workers. One union reaffirmed its stand
that women are co-workers with men and "entitled
to co-eqal rights and responsibilities in the labor
movement;" another union stated that "it is high
lime for unions to realize the importance of organ
izing all women workers as an integral and essential
part of the labor movement."
It is no news that women constitute the reservoir of
manpower for the critical days ahead. Nor is it mere
upposition that women graduates will be called upon
in increasing numbers to new leadership positions in
home, community, business, industry, government,
and education. The problem is how to prepare today
for the uncertain future of tomorrow.
In the meantime, the college woman has immediate
decision to make. Decisions about marriage to marry
now or to wait until she receives her A.8.; to marry
and quit college; U> quit college and go to work or
follow her husband; to marry and return to school.
On this campus, contrary to the prediction at the out
break of Korean hostilities, the increase in the number
ol marriages among the undergraduate women has
been small, and even smaller number of those who
married have left school.
The college woman also is confronted with deci
sions relative to her vocational plans. No longer
possible to decide between marriage and a career,

or even marriage and a lemparary job or a career,
she is faced with the possibility—sometimes the ne
cessity—of planning for all three. It isn't difficult to
find proof of this dilemma. Recent graduates arc
taking temporary jobs for various reasons: to help
their husbands througn their graduate school or to
get them started in professions or business, to be
near their husbands in the service, or as one recent I
graduate remarked. "I can't see myself reading a j
novel at II) o'clock in the morning."
There is evidence too that older college women !
whose education had been interrupted are returning j
to prepare for a career, frequently with the encour
agement of their husbands whom I have heard often
voice their opinions in such words as, "I want my wife j
to be prepared to make the living lor the family in
the work in which she is interested. In case it is j
necessary, it will be good insurance for us alt." The
idea that a woman should be financially independent
is not to be dismissed casually. One needs only to
count the number of women, married or single, in a
group of any size who are supporting dependents to
realize that the idea is worthy of serious consideration.
There is a third decision with which the college
woman is faced. As a citizen of the community, state, j
nation, and world, what part is she choosing to take j
in these affairs? For years, women have been active j
in volunteer service work but after three decades of j
citizen privileges of voting and office holding, their j
participation in politics has been disappointing and
has fallen short of expectation. Today's college women |
reflect something of the same attitude in their prefer- !
ence for appointive over campus-wide elective offices, j
An eminent woman points out "that women are
almost unlettered in the machinations of politics." j
Today's college woman needs to learn as much theory
and practice as she can if she is to gain (lie basic 1
skills and knowledge that are necessary to give her
confidence in this new leadership role. She can no j
longer dodge this responsibility, neither can she ignore 1
the impact of politics, local, national, or world-wide,
on her and her family. She won't, but the lessons will
be hard and the going rugged.
These problems of the college women of today
are not new. Colleges, universities, and educational
organizations have been cognizant of them for some
time and several are conducting surveys and making |
studies on the education of women. Nor arc Ihe |
women students unaware of the situation. At this
University this awareness has been reflected in the j
ways that possibly may indicate a significant trcml. |
More women have paid greater attention to the J
selection of elective courses, have taken an earlier j
and greater interest in graduate schools and grad- |
uate fellowships, and an earlier concern about voca
tional goals, and have frequent questions regarding
the purposes of a liberal arts education.
However, it is not enough to recognize that the pres
ent crisis affects the college woman, too. Nor will the
problems be solved merely by business, industry, and
government creating new job opportunities for the
college woman; nor for political parties to invite
women into the inner circle; nor for the universities
to add a few new courses here and there. Rather, the
situation calls for long time planning and will need
the co-operalion of all interested groups. Especially
is it important that college women themselves have a
share in helping to work out their own destiny. The
Stanford women have handled their own affair; in a j
capable manner and with good judgment and intclli- j
gent insight. 1 know that they are ready fo assume
this greater responsibility. I hope they do.

These problems of the college women of today
are not new. Colleges, universities, and educational

the purposes of a liberal arts education.
However, it is not enough to recognize that the pres
ent crisis affects the college woman, too. Nor will the
problems be solved merely by business, industry, and
government creating new job opportunities for the
college woman; nor for political parties to invite
women into the inner circle; nor for the universities
to add a few new courses here and there. Rather, the
situation calls for long time planning and will need
the co-operalion of all interested groups. Especially
is it important that college women themselves have a
share in helping to work out their own destiny. The
Stanford women have handled their own affair; in a j
capable manner and with good judgment and intclli- j
gent insight. 1 know that they are ready fo assume
this greater responsibility. I hope they do.

Tlie present crisis affects the college woman, too.
On the university campus, the draft with its
accompanying critical problems for the student and
hi: family, for education, for business and industry
has made us keenly aware of the effect of the present
crisis on the liveft of our college men. Not as aware,
however, are we apt to be of the effect of the same
• j . i • ii i: r .. -11 . >-v •< *■. v •

Uuation on the lives of collegc
women. Yet, it is far reaching anc
hould not be dismissed lightly
In one of the recent bulletins o
the U.S. Office of Education the
assumption "that practically even
able-bodied male college studerr
will be called upon for service
military or civilian, during this
generation" is followed by the
■ tatement "that the educational
vocational, and personal plans ol

practically every woman college student likewise will
be affected in one way or another by the needs ol the
deft nse period."
Several "signs of the times" indicate ways in which
the college woman is affected. One sign can be found
in such cold, hard statistics as that women now out
number the men, making up 52% of the population;
that 2()'/a million civilian women are employed today;
and, that there is some evidence that women control
a much of the capital of the United States as the men,
and perhaps more. Another sjgn is seen in the field
of politics..
During the 1952 national elections, women re
ceived more attention from both the major parties
than ever before, and from present indications ap
parently are gaining greater influence in party
p« lilies. In the field of economics, business and in
dustry are definitely out to attract women in greater
numbers than heretofore, while both unions in last
year's conventions issued statements favorable to
women workers. One union reaffirmed its stand
that women are co-workers with men and "entitled
to co-eqal rights and responsibilities in the labor
movement;" another union stated that "it is high
lime for unions to realize the importance of organ
izing all women workers as an integral and essential
part of the labor movement."
It is no news that women constitute the reservoir of
manpower for the critical days ahead. Nor is it mere
upposition that women graduates will be called upon
in increasing numbers to new leadership positions in
home, community, business, industry, government,
and education. The problem is how to prepare today
for the uncertain future of tomorrow.
In the meantime, the college woman has immediate
decision to make. Decisions about marriage to marry
now or to wait until she receives her A.8.; to marry
and quit college; U> quit college and go to work or
follow her husband; to marry and return to school.
On this campus, contrary to the prediction at the out
break of Korean hostilities, the increase in the number
ol marriages among the undergraduate women has
been small, and even smaller number of those who
married have left school.
The college woman also is confronted with deci
sions relative to her vocational plans. No longer
possible to decide between marriage and a career,

or even marriage and a lemparary job or a career,
she is faced with the possibility—sometimes the ne
cessity—of planning for all three. It isn't difficult to
find proof of this dilemma. Recent graduates arc
taking temporary jobs for various reasons: to help
their husbands througn their graduate school or to
get them started in professions or business, to be
near their husbands in the service, or as one recent I
graduate remarked. "I can't see myself reading a j
novel at II) o'clock in the morning."
There is evidence too that older college women !
whose education had been interrupted are returning j
to prepare for a career, frequently with the encour
agement of their husbands whom I have heard often
voice their opinions in such words as, "I want my wife j
to be prepared to make the living lor the family in
the work in which she is interested. In case it is j
necessary, it will be good insurance for us alt." The
idea that a woman should be financially independent
is not to be dismissed casually. One needs only to
count the number of women, married or single, in a
group of any size who are supporting dependents to
realize that the idea is worthy of serious consideration.
There is a third decision with which the college
woman is faced. As a citizen of the community, state, j
nation, and world, what part is she choosing to take j
in these affairs? For years, women have been active j
in volunteer service work but after three decades of j
citizen privileges of voting and office holding, their j
participation in politics has been disappointing and

manpower for the critical days ahead. Nor is it mere
upposition that women graduates will be called upon
in increasing numbers to new leadership positions in
home, community, business, industry, government,
and education. The problem is how to prepare today
for the uncertain future of tomorrow.
In the meantime, the college woman has immediate
decision to make. Decisions about marriage to marry
now or to wait until she receives her A.8.; to marry
and quit college; U> quit college and go to work or
follow her husband; to marry and return to school.
On this campus, contrary to the prediction at the out
break of Korean hostilities, the increase in the number
ol marriages among the undergraduate women has
been small, and even smaller number of those who
married have left school.
The college woman also is confronted with deci
sions relative to her vocational plans. No longer
possible to decide between marriage and a career,

or even marriage and a lemparary job or a career,
she is faced with the possibility—sometimes the ne
cessity—of planning for all three. It isn't difficult to
find proof of this dilemma. Recent graduates arc
taking temporary jobs for various reasons: to help
their husbands througn their graduate school or to
get them started in professions or business, to be
near their husbands in the service, or as one recent I
graduate remarked. "I can't see myself reading a j
novel at II) o'clock in the morning."
There is evidence too that older college women !
whose education had been interrupted are returning j
to prepare for a career, frequently with the encour
agement of their husbands whom I have heard often
voice their opinions in such words as, "I want my wife j
to be prepared to make the living lor the family in
the work in which she is interested. In case it is j
necessary, it will be good insurance for us alt." The
idea that a woman should be financially independent
is not to be dismissed casually. One needs only to
count the number of women, married or single, in a
group of any size who are supporting dependents to
realize that the idea is worthy of serious consideration.
There is a third decision with which the college
woman is faced. As a citizen of the community, state, j
nation, and world, what part is she choosing to take j
in these affairs? For years, women have been active j
in volunteer service work but after three decades of j
citizen privileges of voting and office holding, their j
participation in politics has been disappointing and
has fallen short of expectation. Today's college women |
reflect something of the same attitude in their prefer- !
ence for appointive over campus-wide elective offices, j
An eminent woman points out "that women are
almost unlettered in the machinations of politics." j
Today's college woman needs to learn as much theory
and practice as she can if she is to gain (lie basic 1
skills and knowledge that are necessary to give her
confidence in this new leadership role. She can no j
longer dodge this responsibility, neither can she ignore 1
the impact of politics, local, national, or world-wide,
on her and her family. She won't, but the lessons will
be hard and the going rugged.
These problems of the college women of today
are not new. Colleges, universities, and educational
organizations have been cognizant of them for some
time and several are conducting surveys and making |
studies on the education of women. Nor arc Ihe |
women students unaware of the situation. At this
University this awareness has been reflected in the j
ways that possibly may indicate a significant trcml. |
More women have paid greater attention to the J
selection of elective courses, have taken an earlier j
and greater interest in graduate schools and grad- |
uate fellowships, and an earlier concern about voca
tional goals, and have frequent questions regarding
the purposes of a liberal arts education.
However, it is not enough to recognize that the pres
ent crisis affects the college woman, too. Nor will the
problems be solved merely by business, industry, and
government creating new job opportunities for the
college woman; nor for political parties to invite
women into the inner circle; nor for the universities
to add a few new courses here and there. Rather, the
situation calls for long time planning and will need
the co-operalion of all interested groups. Especially
is it important that college women themselves have a
share in helping to work out their own destiny. The
Stanford women have handled their own affair; in a j
capable manner and with good judgment and intclli- j
gent insight. 1 know that they are ready fo assume
this greater responsibility. I hope they do.

Tlie present crisis affects the college woman, too.
On the university campus, the draft with its
accompanying critical problems for the student and
hi: family, for education, for business and industry
has made us keenly aware of the effect of the present
crisis on the liveft of our college men. Not as aware,
however, are we apt to be of the effect of the same

Uuation on the lives of collegc
women. Yet, it is far reaching anc
hould not be dismissed lightly
In one of the recent bulletins o
the U.S. Office of Education the
assumption "that practically even
able-bodied male college studerr
will be called upon for service
military or civilian, during this
generation" is followed by the
■ tatement "that the educational
vocational, and personal plans ol

practically every woman college student likewise will
be affected in one way or another by the needs ol the
deft nse period."
Several "signs of the times" indicate ways in which
the college woman is affected. One sign can be found
in such cold, hard statistics as that women now out
number the men, making up 52% of the population;
that 2()'/a million civilian women are employed today;
and, that there is some evidence that women control
a much of the capital of the United States as the men,
and perhaps more. Another sjgn is seen in the field
of politics..
During the 1952 national elections, women re
ceived more attention from both the major parties
than ever before, and from present indications ap
parently are gaining greater influence in party
p« lilies. In the field of economics, business and in
dustry are definitely out to attract women in greater
numbers than heretofore, while both unions in last
year's conventions issued statements favorable to
women workers. One union reaffirmed its stand
that women are co-workers with men and "entitled
to co-eqal rights and responsibilities in the labor
movement;" another union stated that "it is high
lime for unions to realize the importance of organ
izing all women workers as an integral and essential
part of the labor movement."

Tlie present crisis affects the college woman, too.
On the university campus, the draft with its
accompanying critical problems for the student and
hi: family, for education, for business and industry
has made us keenly aware of the effect of the present
crisis on the liveft of our college men. Not as aware,
however, are we apt to be of the effect of the same
• j . i • ii i: r .. -11 . >-v •< *■. v •

Uuation on the lives of collegc
women. Yet, it is far reaching anc
hould not be dismissed lightly
In one of the recent bulletins o
the U.S. Office of Education the
assumption "that practically even
able-bodied male college studerr
will be called upon for service
military or civilian, during this
generation" is followed by the
■ tatement "that the educational
vocational, and personal plans ol

practically every woman college student likewise will
be affected in one way or another by the needs ol the
deft nse period."
Several "signs of the times" indicate ways in which
the college woman is affected. One sign can be found
in such cold, hard statistics as that women now out
number the men, making up 52% of the population;
that 2()'/a million civilian women are employed today;
and, that there is some evidence that women control
a much of the capital of the United States as the men,
and perhaps more. Another sjgn is seen in the field
of politics..
During the 1952 national elections, women re
ceived more attention from both the major parties
than ever before, and from present indications ap
parently are gaining greater influence in party
p« lilies. In the field of economics, business and in
dustry are definitely out to attract women in greater
numbers than heretofore, while both unions in last
year's conventions issued statements favorable to
women workers. One union reaffirmed its stand
that women are co-workers with men and "entitled
to co-eqal rights and responsibilities in the labor
movement;" another union stated that "it is high
lime for unions to realize the importance of organ
izing all women workers as an integral and essential
part of the labor movement."
It is no news that women constitute the reservoir of
manpower for the critical days ahead. Nor is it mere
upposition that women graduates will be called upon
in increasing numbers to new leadership positions in
home, community, business, industry, government,
and education. The problem is how to prepare today
for the uncertain future of tomorrow.
In the meantime, the college woman has immediate
decision to make. Decisions about marriage to marry
now or to wait until she receives her A.8.; to marry
and quit college; U> quit college and go to work or
follow her husband; to marry and return to school.
On this campus, contrary to the prediction at the out
break of Korean hostilities, the increase in the number
ol marriages among the undergraduate women has
been small, and even smaller number of those who
married have left school.
The college woman also is confronted with deci
sions relative to her vocational plans. No longer
possible to decide between marriage and a career,

or even marriage and a lemparary job or a career,
she is faced with the possibility—sometimes the ne
cessity—of planning for all three. It isn't difficult to
find proof of this dilemma. Recent graduates arc
taking temporary jobs for various reasons: to help
their husbands througn their graduate school or to
get them started in professions or business, to be
near their husbands in the service, or as one recent I
graduate remarked. "I can't see myself reading a j
novel at II) o'clock in the morning."
There is evidence too that older college women !
whose education had been interrupted are returning j
to prepare for a career, frequently with the encour
agement of their husbands whom I have heard often
voice their opinions in such words as, "I want my wife j
to be prepared to make the living lor the family in
the work in which she is interested. In case it is j
necessary, it will be good insurance for us alt." The
idea that a woman should be financially independent
is not to be dismissed casually. One needs only to
count the number of women, married or single, in a
group of any size who are supporting dependents to
realize that the idea is worthy of serious consideration.
There is a third decision with which the college
woman is faced. As a citizen of the community, state, j
nation, and world, what part is she choosing to take j
in these affairs? For years, women have been active j
in volunteer service work but after three decades of j
citizen privileges of voting and office holding, their j
participation in politics has been disappointing and
has fallen short of expectation. Today's college women |
reflect something of the same attitude in their prefer- !
ence for appointive over campus-wide elective offices, j
An eminent woman points out "that women are
almost unlettered in the machinations of politics." j
Today's college woman needs to learn as much theory
and practice as she can if she is to gain (lie basic 1
skills and knowledge that are necessary to give her
confidence in this new leadership role. She can no j
longer dodge this responsibility, neither can she ignore 1
the impact of politics, local, national, or world-wide,
on her and her family. She won't, but the lessons will
be hard and the going rugged.
These problems of the college women of today
are not new. Colleges, universities, and educational
organizations have been cognizant of them for some
time and several are conducting surveys and making |
studies on the education of women. Nor arc Ihe |
women students unaware of the situation. At this
University this awareness has been reflected in the j
ways that possibly may indicate a significant trcml. |
More women have paid greater attention to the J
selection of elective courses, have taken an earlier j
and greater interest in graduate schools and grad- |
uate fellowships, and an earlier concern about voca
tional goals, and have frequent questions regarding
the purposes of a liberal arts education.
However, it is not enough to recognize that the pres
ent crisis affects the college woman, too. Nor will the
problems be solved merely by business, industry, and
government creating new job opportunities for the
college woman; nor for political parties to invite
women into the inner circle; nor for the universities
to add a few new courses here and there. Rather, the
situation calls for long time planning and will need
the co-operalion of all interested groups. Especially
is it important that college women themselves have a
share in helping to work out their own destiny. The
Stanford women have handled their own affair; in a j
capable manner and with good judgment and intclli- j
gent insight. 1 know that they are ready fo assume
this greater responsibility. I hope they do.
