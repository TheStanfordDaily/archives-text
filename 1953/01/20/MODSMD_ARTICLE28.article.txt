# Everyone Wants Your Blood
## 
### 
There's been a lot of talk about blood dona
tions this year. First, a fall quarter drive for
Korea, which fell far short of its goal. Then
Ken Schechter came along, convinced Excom
that Stanford could deliver 5,000 pints of blood,
und began organizing his forces for the big
push in April.
Now it's still another appeal—but very spe
cial and very close to home. Married students
and their dependents are asked to donate this
Friday at the Village to the Student Dependent
Hospital Fund.
This blood fund takes care of married stu
dents in two ways: it breaks the blow of sud
den family emergencies by taking Cdie of
expensive medical treatment; and it provides
blood lor students' dependents, if needed.

Thus, it acts as a "blood scholarship" by enabl
ing stricken parents to continue in school even
when their savings have been wiped out by
illness.
Although the idea of such a fund originated
in the Village when an emergency did strike
a student family, the fund now extends to the
dependents of all married students, no matter
where they live. Therefore, il is important that
contributions be made by as many of these
students as possible.
Donors to the fund will be eligible to give to
the all-cainpus drive in April, since the two
drives are the required three months apart.
Another blood appeal? Yes, b*ut vitally de
serving of support by the Stanford Family for
its own. —Mary Massey
