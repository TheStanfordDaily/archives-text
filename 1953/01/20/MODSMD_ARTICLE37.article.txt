# PUNTS AND PITCHES

### Pete Grothe 
Last week, the NC2A rules committee abolished platoon football as we
now know it. This was the most important rules change since platoon
football was legislated into existence in 1941.
Briefly, the rule states that a player leaving the game in the first or
third quarters cannot return until the beginning of the next quarter and
that a flayer leaving the game in the second or fourth quarters cannot
return to action until the final four minutes of that quarter.
This means, for example, that UCLA's great tailback, Paul Cameron,
.oust play defense as well as offense or else be sacrificed to the Bruin cause
for the bulk of a quarter.
It Helps Us
But the question of vital concern to us on the Farm is how the new
ruling is going to affect Stanford football.
The answer it clear cut: it will help it.
As Dutch Fehring, Stanford's great line coach, put it,"The old" ruling
meant that our top 44 men had to compete with the top 44 of USC or Cal.

Naturally, we were thinner in ranks than those
schools which had lower scholastic standings,
lower tuition, and more scholarships. With
this new ruling, it means that our top 20 men
will be on about an equal plain with Cal's top
35. And there's no doubt that we can always
, uuster 20 good men."
We talked to every one of the Stanford
coaches, and to a man their opinion was, "The
rule is good for football, and it's good for
Stanford."
Pappy No Like
On the other hand. Pappy Waldorf and SC's
«vess Hill were having a loud moan. They
knew that the new rule would bring the

smaller schools more to their level. Word has it that guards were patroling
Hill's residence, lest he make some rash attempt on his life.
We made it a point to talk to as many gridders as we could. With one
exception, Jerry Goldberg, they were for the new rule. Some allowed that
their chances might be hampered because of the doubled competition for
positions, but that it was good for Stanford.
John Ludeke, Bob Garrett, Joe Long, and Norm Manoogian were among
the most enthusiastic for it. Naturally, this rule really works in favor of
a well-conditioned athlete like Manoogian as it would for Bob Mathias, if
he decided to play again.
Bob Garrett is now out for track, not to compete, but rather to increase
his speed to play defense and cover passes.
Track Coach Jack Weiershauser thinks that he can cut Gerrett's time
c rom 12.0 to 10.5 or 10.7 in the century. Incidentally, Garrett played a lot
of defense as a freshman and was good at it. Also, Sam Morley played a
lot of defense in high school and John Steinberg played practically only
defense as a freshman.
• Torrid Competition
There is one aspect of the new rule which no one can deny. The
competition for positions will be torrid. Look at the center slot. Jerry
Joldberg is fast off his marks, a good blocker, but not the devastating
linebacker that Ted Tanner is. On the other hand, Tanner is not the
offensive blocker that Goldberg is. Who starts? And what about Marsh
Howe and Joe Long who are also very capable center-linebackers.
If you really want a shocker, look at the tackle position. Who will be
the starting two out of the field of John Ludecke, John Stanton, Dick Gant,
Barry Smith, and frosh sensation Joel Sappenfield?
At guards, Norm Manoogian and Phil Wilson look like pretty good bets.
Jut then how about Matt Armitage and Win Wedge, the promising soph
guards who were first string defense all last season. And where does this
leave Paul Revak who started a couple of games on offense last year and
up-and-coming Hoy Krickeberg and John Roberg.
Football season next year should prove interesting.
