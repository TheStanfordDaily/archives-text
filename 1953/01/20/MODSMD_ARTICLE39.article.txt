# NIT May Fight NCAA Squeeze

### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 20 (UP)—The
National Invitation Basketball Tour
nament may be saved from "slow
death" by abandoning NCAA rules
and inviting teams that play fresh
men.
Asa S. Bushnell, chairman of the
NIT committee, said today the ac
tion may be necessary to combat an
NCAA "squeeze" in the bidding for
teams.
The NCAA has hurt the pros
pects for a top-flight field in the
NIT by passing a rule preventing
teams which enter the NCAA
championship tournament from
competing in any other post-sea
son event. To make sure, the
NCAA also assigned the same
dates as the NIT, roughly the sec
ond week in March.
To offset this, Bushnell sa.id the
j NIT committee may decide to invite
teams that employ freshmen and
fourth-year players, both banned
in the NCAA tournament.
The move would enable the
NIT to invite little Rio Grande Col
lege of Ohio, which is led by Clar
ence (Bevo) Francis, a spectacular
freshman center who has averaged
•more than 50 points per game.
"Many conferences and independ
ent schools still are permitting
freshmen and fourth-year men to
play," Bushnell pointed out at the
weekly luncheon of the metropoli
tan basketball writers. "I person
ally believe that the invitation tour
nament should admit teams under
the same rules by which they have
been playing all season."
