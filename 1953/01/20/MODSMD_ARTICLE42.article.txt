NEW YORK, Jan. 19 (UP)—Ex-
Kentucky basketball star Bill Spi
vey begged his way Into a $1,000-a
-game fix ring, one of his former
teammates testified today.
Spivey denied to a Grand Jury
that he had ever participated in fixes
or even discussed them. It indicted
him for perjury. And. as trial testi
mony opened today, former Kentu
cky player Walter Hirsch told this
tale of Spivey's entry into the fix
ring:
It had been operating the season
before without Spivey, Hirsch said.
But during the summer of 1950 Spi
vey was working in a Catskill Moun
tani resort where he met a gambler
named "George."
This "George" told the seven-foot
Spivey that Hirsch, Dale Barn
stable, and Jim Line were fixing
games, Hirsch testified. So when
Spivey returned to school in the
fall, he asked Hirsch about it.
At first, Hirsch said, he denied fix
ing games. But Spivey wheedled a
confession out of him. Then, he said,
Spivey asked about prospects for the
coming season.
Hirsch said a dinner was arranged
at a Lexington, Ky., inn where he,
Spivey, Line, and convicted fixer
Jack (Zip) West gathered. They
agreed to fix games for gambler
West, Hirsch said.
