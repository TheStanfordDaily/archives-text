MIGHTY MIDGET MINE —A newly developed land mine, made of plastic and weighing only
41/2 ounces, will soon be sent to troops in Korea, the Army announced in Washington. The
mine is capable of inflicting as much damage as the nine-pound anti-personnel mine of World
War 11. Two are shown here with a three-inch rule to mark their size. —NEA Telephoto
