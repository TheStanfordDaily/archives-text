# Skinner's Dramatic Virtuosity Undeniable in Revue 'Paris '90'
## 
### MARY FRAZER 
Cornelia Otis Skinner's solo re
vue, "Paris '90," is a remarkable
feat of vivacity and endurance: vi
vacity on Miss Skinners part, and
occasionally endurance from the
audience.
For three hours, Miss Skinner
leaps from character to character,
effecting 14 changes of costume,
scenery, and personality, each in a
matter of seconds. Her dramatic
virtuosity cannot be denied con
gratulation.
Women of the Champs Elysees
and the Left Bank are sketched in
Acts I and II; a flirtatious nurse
maid, the "New Woman" in bloom
ers, and a haughty duchess are out
standing among the ten presenta
tions.
The Toulouse - Lautrec portraits

of Act HI, especially the dancer, La
Goulae, and the prostitute, "Deaf
Bertha," are the highlights of the
show.
Many of the remaining portrayals
have their amusing and incisive
moments, but close to a third of the
program verges on the tedious. Miss
Skinner often does not stop at the
point of wit, but continues to re
emphasize (and over - emphasize)
the characteristics which she at
tempts to portray Brevity, which
should be the rule in most mono
logues, is not a noticeable feature
of Miss Skinner's dramatic writing.
With some skillful blue-penciling,
her revue would be brilliant rather
than merely amusing. The "filet
mignon" is there, but it needs trim
ming.
