### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 (UP) —Dwight L). Eisenhower took on the tremendous burdens of the
Presidency today with a prayer, a cautious peace feeler to Russia, and a stern warning that Amer
ica will fight before bov/ing to aggression.
Moments after being sworn in as the nation's 34th President in a sun-bathed ceremony, the
soldier hero of World WaMI asked God "in a little prayer of my own" to help him and all the
people work for the good of our beloved country and for Thy glory."
The new chief executive, who also asked for power to "discern right from wrong," took his
brief but solemn oath of office at 12:31 p.m. (EST) from Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson.
Then, with Mrs. Eisenhower sitting nearby, her lips quivering, he surprised his vast audience
by asking it to join with him in a prayer he had written after attending special church services
earlier in the day.
His prayer: "Especially v/e that our concern shall be for the people, regaidless of station,
race, or calling. Mny co-operation be permitted and bo the mutual aim of those who under the
concept of our constitution hold different political beliefs."
In his inaugural address, the new President said the aim of his inauguration will be "an earth
of peace." He said he is ready to join "any and all" nations in reducing armaments and wiping

out feat and distrust providing they
are willing to negotiate "honestly."
But lie warned there can be no
appeasement, no surrender of this
nation's secui ity.
He laid down nine "rules of
conduct" tot his administration
and lipid forth a guarded invita
tion to Joseph Stalin to negotiate
world peace.
But he also issued a warning
that the United States would
rat lie v fight than "try to placate
an aggressor" by "trading honor
for security."
"In the final choice," he said, "a
soldier's pack is not so heavy a
burden as a prisoner's chains."
Interrupted five times by ap
plause, he drew his greatest re
sponse when he said:
"We wish our friends the world
over («» Know (his above all we
face tlie (Communist) threat —
| not with dread and confusion-*
hut with confidence and convic
j lion."
At 12:15 p.m. (EST) Sen. William
j K. Knowland of California adminis
| tered the oath to Vice-President
Richard M. Nixon.
Then at 12:.'I0 p.m. (EST) Mr. Ei
senhower stepped forward as his
wife's tears continued to fall. For a
second he flashed the famous Eisen
hower grin and raised his out
stretched hands over his head in the
familiar campaign pose.

Then solemnly be repeated af
ire Vinson the words <l»«t made
him guardian of the nation's wel
fare for the next four years.
"I, IJwight f>. Eisenhower, sol
emnly swear <liat I will faithfully
cxcnitr the office of President of
tlie United States, and will, to the
host of my ability, preserve, pro
tect, and defend 'lie constitution
«if the United States, so help me
<«<»d,"
The President never once used
the words ''Russia" or "Communist"
in ins inaugural address, which was
broadcast and televised across the
nation. But his entire peech dealt
with the "force.; of cood and evil"
and those who "know no God hut
force."
lie held out an 'tflri «»f contin
ued help (•» other nations allied
against Cnimouni' t aggression but
said they will he expected to do
all they can fo help themselves.
He promised never to use this na
tion's strength to try and impose on
others its "cherished political and
economic institutions." On the con
trary, he said, he will help them
build up their production and trade.
Furthermore, he said, "we hold
all continents and peoples in equal
regard and honor," and "reject any
insinuation that one race or an
other, one people or another, is in

any sense inferior or expendable."
Republican anH Democratic Con
gressmen generally praised Presi
dent Eisenhower's inaugural ad
dress as "inspiring" and "dramatic."
