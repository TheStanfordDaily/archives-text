# He an Assistant
## 
### 
Three hundred payment orders to sign every
week.
Two hundred fifty treasurers to orient and
shepherd through the intricacies of the Student
Organizations' Fund.
Ten organizations whose meetings should be
attended regularly.
These are a few of the reasons why Stanford's
Student Manager needs an assistant. And these
are a few of the reasons why we're glad Excom
last week granted Student Manager Steve Horn
an assistant to serve until the end of this year.
Since the appointive Student Manager sys
tem was started at Stanford in 1919, the
amount of money which goes through his
office has increased from $50,000 to close to
half a million dollars. And the size and com
plexity of the job has increased accordingly.
The principal argument against creating the
position was that many of the tasks which have
made the Student Manager's job so large this
year are beyond his direct call of duty, and that
a Student Manager less conscientious than
Horn would have less to do.
We agree with this contentionâ€”but not en
tirely. No doubt some of Horn's work, though
unquestionably worthwhile, would not be ex

pected of the average Student Manager. Take
his efforts toward starting a Stanford Informa
tion Program for example.
But many of the other things he has done
should be done by the Student Manager . . .
like his work on the publications' finances.
Still other things are needed, and the Stu
dent Manager's office seems the one best
equipped to take care of them. Price studies
are a good example. As Horn himself points
out, student organizations buy of
doughnuts every year, thousand of paper cups,
heavens knows how many feet of crepe paper.
Organization treasurers need to know what
prices are fair for these commodities. These
studies, incidentally, are one of the projects
scheduled to be undertaken by the new Assist
ant Student Manager.
This new position has been CP t up only for
the rest of the year. The ASSU executive com
mittee was convinced that Student Manager
Horn is doing enough worthwhile work to war
rant an assistant. Establishing the post perma
nently will probably depend on insuring that
future student manager's use the aid to further
their activities into fields where their attention
/
is needed.
