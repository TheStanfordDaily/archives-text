# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
THE HAPPY DAILY FAMILY
Noel, a crack reporter from the Chappie, barged in
the Daily Shack, pointed a boney finger at me, and
said, "Lissen, Growth, I want to see you."
"The name's Grotay," I allowed.
"I've got a great idea," he spouted, "I'm going to do

an expose on the Daily. The
Chappie is having a circulation
war with Viewpoint, and this is
what we need to put us over the
top."
"Why do you have to do an ex
pose on the Daily? Why don't you
use some catchy phrase like
'Never since the Indians sold
Manhattan for $24 has so much
dirt been available for so little,"
I said, trying to make a funny.

"Oh," admitted Noel, getting sick over the type
writer.
"I suggest," I suggested, "that you refer to my late
partner-in-crime lick McLean's Bull Session of last
year." R
"But," Noel objected, "that was last year, and the
personnel has changed." *
"Okay, you asked for it. Throw ten copies of
Burns on the fire and Uncle Pete will tell you about
the happy Daily Family."
"First, you've got the Queen Bee of the Daily,
Dorothy Dodge. She's from Susanville, where the
chickens and roosters outnumber the people."
"She's one of those Democrats, isn't she?" queried
Noel, scratching down notes.
"Yes, as goes Dodge, so doesn't go the nation," I
said, trying to force some humor. "She is singularly
responsible for promoting more letter-to-the-pditor
words from Dare Stark McMullen than Donald E.
Close and Marvin O. Adams ever thought of."
"Then you have Walt Menninger, managing editor,
and a member of the famed family of psychiatrists.
They've disowned him ever since he got a "C" in
psych 51. Walt is always hurrying someplace, and he
i engaged to Connie Libbey, Business Manager, who
also is always hurrying someplace. They're always
hurrying so much that it's a surprise they ever had
enough time to pause to get engaged."
"Ileal hustlers, eh?" commented Noel.
"Then there's sleek, scheming Mary Massey, the
vampire of the staff. Witness the headline she wrote
for Tuesday's editorial, "Everyone Wants Your
Blood." Mary likes to play like she's drunk all the
time, so that when she's really drunk no one will
know the difference."

"The other associate editor is Jim Madison, who just
took a cast off his hand. He tells everyone that he
wrecked it in a Theta Chi intra-mural football game,
but he actually got it falling up (yes, up) the stairs
in his house. He doesn't fit into the staff, because he's
not a character. When he walks down the street
people just point at him as a normal, red-blooded
American boy."
"Now, the next guy, sports-writer Mike Hudson, is
really a character. When he walks down the street,
people just point at him. Mike is the frantic bettor
on the staff. Once he bet a guy $1.50 that he'd eat
a formaldihyded eye from a dogfish shark in bio lab
. . . and won. At last week's UCLA game, Mike
shouted to the referees, "Only human beings allowed
on this court, Moyer and Wagner. You lose." This
woudn't have been so bad, except radio micro
phone was at Mike's elbow and it w^ o wide open.
"A real psycho, this Hudson, eh?""said Noel, his
eyes bulging at the assortment of characters on the
Daily.
"But as Al Jolson used to say, 'You ain't heard
nothing yet.' The biggest cog in the Daily machin
ery is staff editor Sophie Bernstein, last c;f the red
hot mamas. Then (here's Lathrop's gift to the Daily,
Barbara Tuerk, whom everybody hates. Until last
quarter, Barbara had gone plus 100 jjfir 50 units."
"I can't forget the strong, silent .yJVtsman, Larry
Cahn, who can't. And Hadley Roff, me son of poor
but honest immigrant folks from Santa Cruz, who
during the election prompted the statement from a
subscriber, 'Adlai's doing badly, and so is Hadley.'"
"Also Tricky Dick Maltzman, who is so tricky that
he fakes himself out, and Winthrop Griffith, the name
no one can pronounce 10 tfmes in succession. Griff
jumps through knee deep puddles singing, " 'I'm Sing
ing In The Rain.' "
"Then there's Sue»Wheat from Kentfield, sleezy
Gloria Breckcnridge, queenly Pat King. Coweyes
Connie Gomperts, Phil (the Bear) Berman, cynical
Don Webster, Ruth Jahnke from Alaska, all of
whom came into the Daily to practice their typing
lessons and were pressed into service."
'The biggest wierdos on the staff can be found in the
dark room . . . the photogs. Glenn Erickson does all
the work and Roy Broun and Jack Byrne do all the
worrying. They live every moment like it's a crisis."
"Jinkies!" broke the Chappie reporter, "what a
bunch of psychos."
"Yeah, like I say, they're quite an assortment.
Someday I'll have to write a Bull Session about them."

THE HAPPY DAILY FAMILY
Noel, a crack reporter from the Chappie, barged in
the Daily Shack, pointed a boney finger at me, and
said, "Lissen, Growth, I want to see you."
"The name's Grotay," I allowed.
"I've got a great idea," he spouted, "I'm going to do

an expose on the Daily. The
Chappie is having a circulation
war with Viewpoint, and this is
what we need to put us over the
top."
"Why do you have to do an ex
pose on the Daily? Why don't you
use some catchy phrase like
'Never since the Indians sold
Manhattan for $24 has so much
dirt been available for so little,"
I said, trying to make a funny.

"Oh," admitted Noel, getting sick over the type
writer.
"I suggest," I suggested, "that you refer to my late
partner-in-crime lick McLean's Bull Session of last
year." R
"But," Noel objected, "that was last year, and the
personnel has changed." *
"Okay, you asked for it. Throw ten copies of
Burns on the fire and Uncle Pete will tell you about
the happy Daily Family."
"First, you've got the Queen Bee of the Daily,
Dorothy Dodge. She's from Susanville, where the
chickens and roosters outnumber the people."
"She's one of those Democrats, isn't she?" queried
Noel, scratching down notes.
"Yes, as goes Dodge, so doesn't go the nation," I
said, trying to force some humor. "She is singularly
responsible for promoting more letter-to-the-pditor
words from Dare Stark McMullen than Donald E.
Close and Marvin O. Adams ever thought of."
"Then you have Walt Menninger, managing editor,
and a member of the famed family of psychiatrists.
They've disowned him ever since he got a "C" in
psych 51. Walt is always hurrying someplace, and he
i engaged to Connie Libbey, Business Manager, who
also is always hurrying someplace. They're always
hurrying so much that it's a surprise they ever had
enough time to pause to get engaged."
"Ileal hustlers, eh?" commented Noel.
"Then there's sleek, scheming Mary Massey, the
vampire of the staff. Witness the headline she wrote
for Tuesday's editorial, "Everyone Wants Your
Blood." Mary likes to play like she's drunk all the
time, so that when she's really drunk no one will
know the difference."

"The other associate editor is Jim Madison, who just
took a cast off his hand. He tells everyone that he
wrecked it in a Theta Chi intra-mural football game,
but he actually got it falling up (yes, up) the stairs
in his house. He doesn't fit into the staff, because he's
not a character. When he walks down the street
people just point at him as a normal, red-blooded
American boy."
"Now, the next guy, sports-writer Mike Hudson, is
really a character. When he walks down the street,
people just point at him. Mike is the frantic bettor
on the staff. Once he bet a guy $1.50 that he'd eat
a formaldihyded eye from a dogfish shark in bio lab
. . . and won. At last week's UCLA game, Mike
shouted to the referees, "Only human beings allowed
on this court, Moyer and Wagner. You lose." This
woudn't have been so bad, except radio micro
phone was at Mike's elbow and it w^ o wide open.
"A real psycho, this Hudson, eh?""said Noel, his
eyes bulging at the assortment of characters on the
Daily.
"But as Al Jolson used to say, 'You ain't heard
nothing yet.' The biggest cog in the Daily machin
ery is staff editor Sophie Bernstein, last c;f the red
hot mamas. Then (here's Lathrop's gift to the Daily,
Barbara Tuerk, whom everybody hates. Until last
quarter, Barbara had gone plus 100 jjfir 50 units."
"I can't forget the strong, silent .yJVtsman, Larry
Cahn, who can't. And Hadley Roff, me son of poor
but honest immigrant folks from Santa Cruz, who
during the election prompted the statement from a
subscriber, 'Adlai's doing badly, and so is Hadley.'"
"Also Tricky Dick Maltzman, who is so tricky that
he fakes himself out, and Winthrop Griffith, the name
no one can pronounce 10 tfmes in succession. Griff
jumps through knee deep puddles singing, " 'I'm Sing
ing In The Rain.' "
"Then there's Sue»Wheat from Kentfield, sleezy
Gloria Breckcnridge, queenly Pat King. Coweyes
Connie Gomperts, Phil (the Bear) Berman, cynical
Don Webster, Ruth Jahnke from Alaska, all of
whom came into the Daily to practice their typing
lessons and were pressed into service."
'The biggest wierdos on the staff can be found in the
dark room . . . the photogs. Glenn Erickson does all
the work and Roy Broun and Jack Byrne do all the
worrying. They live every moment like it's a crisis."
"Jinkies!" broke the Chappie reporter, "what a
bunch of psychos."
"Yeah, like I say, they're quite an assortment.
Someday I'll have to write a Bull Session about them."

Someday I'll have to write a Bull Session about them."

THE HAPPY DAILY FAMILY
Noel, a crack reporter from the Chappie, barged in
the Daily Shack, pointed a boney finger at me, and
said, "Lissen, Growth, I want to see you."
"The name's Grotay," I allowed.
"I've got a great idea," he spouted, "I'm going to do

an expose on the Daily. The
Chappie is having a circulation
war with Viewpoint, and this is
what we need to put us over the
top."
"Why do you have to do an ex
pose on the Daily? Why don't you
use some catchy phrase like
'Never since the Indians sold
Manhattan for $24 has so much
dirt been available for so little,"
I said, trying to make a funny.

"Oh," admitted Noel, getting sick over the type
writer.
"I suggest," I suggested, "that you refer to my late
partner-in-crime lick McLean's Bull Session of last
year." R
"But," Noel objected, "that was last year, and the
personnel has changed." *
"Okay, you asked for it. Throw ten copies of
Burns on the fire and Uncle Pete will tell you about
the happy Daily Family."
"First, you've got the Queen Bee of the Daily,
Dorothy Dodge. She's from Susanville, where the
chickens and roosters outnumber the people."
"She's one of those Democrats, isn't she?" queried
Noel, scratching down notes.
"Yes, as goes Dodge, so doesn't go the nation," I
said, trying to force some humor. "She is singularly
responsible for promoting more letter-to-the-pditor
words from Dare Stark McMullen than Donald E.
Close and Marvin O. Adams ever thought of."
"Then you have Walt Menninger, managing editor,
and a member of the famed family of psychiatrists.
They've disowned him ever since he got a "C" in
psych 51. Walt is always hurrying someplace, and he
i engaged to Connie Libbey, Business Manager, who
also is always hurrying someplace. They're always
hurrying so much that it's a surprise they ever had
enough time to pause to get engaged."
"Ileal hustlers, eh?" commented Noel.
"Then there's sleek, scheming Mary Massey, the
vampire of the staff. Witness the headline she wrote
for Tuesday's editorial, "Everyone Wants Your
Blood." Mary likes to play like she's drunk all the
time, so that when she's really drunk no one will
know the difference."

"The other associate editor is Jim Madison, who just
took a cast off his hand. He tells everyone that he
wrecked it in a Theta Chi intra-mural football game,
but he actually got it falling up (yes, up) the stairs
in his house. He doesn't fit into the staff, because he's
not a character. When he walks down the street
people just point at him as a normal, red-blooded
American boy."
"Now, the next guy, sports-writer Mike Hudson, is
really a character. When he walks down the street,
people just point at him. Mike is the frantic bettor
on the staff. Once he bet a guy $1.50 that he'd eat
a formaldihyded eye from a dogfish shark in bio lab
. . . and won. At last week's UCLA game, Mike
shouted to the referees, "Only human beings allowed
on this court, Moyer and Wagner. You lose." This
woudn't have been so bad, except radio micro
phone was at Mike's elbow and it w^ o wide open.
"A real psycho, this Hudson, eh?""said Noel, his
eyes bulging at the assortment of characters on the
Daily.
"But as Al Jolson used to say, 'You ain't heard
nothing yet.' The biggest cog in the Daily machin
ery is staff editor Sophie Bernstein, last c;f the red
hot mamas. Then (here's Lathrop's gift to the Daily,
Barbara Tuerk, whom everybody hates. Until last
quarter, Barbara had gone plus 100 jjfir 50 units."
"I can't forget the strong, silent .yJVtsman, Larry
Cahn, who can't. And Hadley Roff, me son of poor
but honest immigrant folks from Santa Cruz, who
during the election prompted the statement from a
subscriber, 'Adlai's doing badly, and so is Hadley.'"
"Also Tricky Dick Maltzman, who is so tricky that
he fakes himself out, and Winthrop Griffith, the name
no one can pronounce 10 tfmes in succession. Griff
jumps through knee deep puddles singing, " 'I'm Sing
ing In The Rain.' "
"Then there's Sue»Wheat from Kentfield, sleezy
Gloria Breckcnridge, queenly Pat King. Coweyes
Connie Gomperts, Phil (the Bear) Berman, cynical
Don Webster, Ruth Jahnke from Alaska, all of
whom came into the Daily to practice their typing
lessons and were pressed into service."
'The biggest wierdos on the staff can be found in the
dark room . . . the photogs. Glenn Erickson does all
the work and Roy Broun and Jack Byrne do all the
worrying. They live every moment like it's a crisis."
"Jinkies!" broke the Chappie reporter, "what a
bunch of psychos."
"Yeah, like I say, they're quite an assortment.
Someday I'll have to write a Bull Session about them."
