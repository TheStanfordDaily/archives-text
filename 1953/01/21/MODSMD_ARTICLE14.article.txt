# CAMPUS OPINION
## Social Science Survey 
### 
To the Editor: I
Stanford is a university which strives to give its
students a liberal education, yet there are a great
many students who attend and graduate without hav
ing the opportunity to attain a good liberal educa
tion. These are the students who are being trained
in the undergraduate professional programs — en
gineering, physics, chemistry, etc.—which demand
such a large part of the student's time that he has
barely a chance to fulfill the university lower division
requirements, let alone sample other fields of
learning.
The liberal education of these students consists of
Western Civ and the ten required units of social
science. And of what do these units consist? They
consist of courses given by the various departments
intended primarily to introduce students planning to
major in that department or allied departments to the
subject, e.g., Eicon. 1 and 2, Political Science 1 and 2,
Political Science 20 etc.
While these are worthwhile courses in themselves
and do a good job of introducing prospective majors
to the subject matter of their respective fields, they
are not suitable courses for the student whose time
for the social sciences is seriously curtailed by ex
tensive professional requirements. The university
has seen and met this problem in the case of students
not science majors by developing general survey
courses in the physical sciences and the biological

Why not, then, a general survey course in the social
sciences for majors in engineering and the physical
and biological sciences? Such a course could be the
required lower division social scienco course for such
students and would give them a much broader con
cept of the social sciences than they are now able to
obtain. Such a course could be, for example, a three
quarter five unit program that would cover in a more
general and rigorous fashion some of the material
now presented in the elementary economics, political
science, and sociology courses.
Such a course would be taught with the aim, not to
train future scientists, but rather to give our future
scientists and engineers an insight into the history
and mechanics of our society and to prepare them for
the leadership which they, because of their position
of importance in this technological age, can and should
exercise in the future. With science and engineering
becoming more and more specialized and compart
mentalized it is essential that something along those
lines be done soon if the university is to turn out
well-rounded, let alone "liberally educated" human
beings.
I want to thank you for your time in reading this
lengthy letter. I hope that both the ideas and the
proposed method for their expression meet with your
approval. In any case I hope I may hear from you
in the future.

and mechanics of our society and to prepare them for
the leadership which they, because of their position
of importance in this technological age, can and should
exercise in the future. With science and engineering
becoming more and more specialized and compart
mentalized it is essential that something along those
lines be done soon if the university is to turn out
well-rounded, let alone "liberally educated" human
beings.
I want to thank you for your time in reading this
lengthy letter. I hope that both the ideas and the
proposed method for their expression meet with your
approval. In any case I hope I may hear from you
in the future.

Stanford is a university which strives to give its
students a liberal education, yet there are a great
many students who attend and graduate without hav
ing the opportunity to attain a good liberal educa
tion. These are the students who are being trained
in the undergraduate professional programs — en
gineering, physics, chemistry, etc.—which demand
such a large part of the student's time that he has
barely a chance to fulfill the university lower division
requirements, let alone sample other fields of
learning.
The liberal education of these students consists of
Western Civ and the ten required units of social
science. And of what do these units consist? They
consist of courses given by the various departments
intended primarily to introduce students planning to
major in that department or allied departments to the
subject, e.g., Eicon. 1 and 2, Political Science 1 and 2,
Political Science 20 etc.
While these are worthwhile courses in themselves
and do a good job of introducing prospective majors
to the subject matter of their respective fields, they
are not suitable courses for the student whose time
for the social sciences is seriously curtailed by ex
tensive professional requirements. The university
has seen and met this problem in the case of students
not science majors by developing general survey
courses in the physical sciences and the biological

Why not, then, a general survey course in the social
sciences for majors in engineering and the physical
and biological sciences? Such a course could be the
required lower division social scienco course for such
students and would give them a much broader con
cept of the social sciences than they are now able to
obtain. Such a course could be, for example, a three
quarter five unit program that would cover in a more
general and rigorous fashion some of the material
now presented in the elementary economics, political
science, and sociology courses.
Such a course would be taught with the aim, not to
train future scientists, but rather to give our future
scientists and engineers an insight into the history
and mechanics of our society and to prepare them for
the leadership which they, because of their position
of importance in this technological age, can and should
exercise in the future. With science and engineering
becoming more and more specialized and compart
mentalized it is essential that something along those
lines be done soon if the university is to turn out
