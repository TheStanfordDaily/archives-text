## 
### 
Fifty years to the day after
worshipers first entered its
heavy bronze doors, Stanford
Memorial Church will hold an
anniversary service next Sun
day at 11 a.m.
The non-sectarian church, world -
famed for its mosaics, windows, and
other works of art, was dedicated
on Sunday, Jan. 25, 1903.
The golden anniversary sermon
will be delivered by the Right Rev.
Stephen Fielding Bayne, Jr., of Se
attle, Bishop of the Episcopal Dio
cese of Olympia.
Stanford Chaplain Robert M.
Minto will conduct the service and
President Wallace Sterling will
bring greetings to the congregation.
An organ recital in the church
tomorrow at 4:15 p.m. will mark
the beginning of the anniversary
observance. Herbert B. Nanney,
University organist, will play.
The Memorial Choir of GO
voices, directed by Harold C.
Schmidt, will present a special
concert at 3:30 p.m. Sunday, as
sisted by members of the Stanford
Symphony, Sandor Saigo, conduc
tor.
A reception at Bowman Alumni
House will follow the concert.
More than 100 special guests
have been invited to the 11 o'clock
service, among them Bay Area rep
resentatives of all religious denom
inations.
The dedication of Memorial
Church was the climax of many
years of hope and planning by Jane
Lathrop Stanford. She and her
husband had provided in the
Founding Grant of the University
that a church should stand at the
heart of the campus. Stanford
thereby became unique among
American universities in having a
large church from its early days.
