## Stines: Russia Backward; Slides Illustrate Claim 
### PETER GROTHE 
Norman J. Stines, until recently a member of the American
embassy in Moscow, took a packed audience in Memorial Audi
torium last night on a vicarious trip "Inside Moscow Today."
Stines, who returned from Moscow four months ago, accom
panied his lecture with 80 colored slides of Moscow and some

of the outlying districts.
The speaker, who graduated from
Stanford in journalism in 1935,
opined that there was a major dif
ference between Nazi Germany and
Communist Russia.
"Germany," he said, "was a to
talitarian police state, boasted about
it.and included that fact in its prop
anda. Russia, like Germany, is a
totalitarian police state, but its
propaganda pretends that the So
viet Union is democratic, and it
holds up a bright future to those
who would change to Communism.
"However, unlike Germany, Rus
sia is backward. Part of the crudity
of its regime is a result of the
backwardness of the country."

The slides, most of them taken
illegally, showed the Kremlin, Red
Square, some of the Communist
military demonstrations, how the
Russian people look and dress, and
some of the sections outside Mos
cow.
A point that Stines emphasized,
both by word and by picture, is
that Russia is a highly backward
country. Running water is very
rare; some of the highest Russian
personnel live in apartments that in
the United States would be consid
ered slums; that the highway sys
tem and load system outside Mos
cow is appalling (for example, there
is no highway from Moscow to 400-
miles-away Leningrad, thr second
largest city in Russia); and that
clothes and food are terrifically ex*
pensive (a suit costs about $400, ano
the average Russian makes about
$150 a month).
