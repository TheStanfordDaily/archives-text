## Something Called the Stanford Fever 
### 
The losses which Stanford athletic teams suffer may be partly blamed <ji
the tough admissions, the too few benefits or aids offered athletes, the
poor coaching, the poor material, and numerous other variables which al
times are called the reasons for losing teams. But we feel that often il
is something else, something we once heard referred to as the Stanford
Fever.
Stanford Fever is an intangible and it's a negative; of that there is little
doubt. Basically it is the lack of incentive and drive that seem to accom
pany so many Stanford athletic teams; it is the playing of the game for
the game's sake, not so much for the win or for the fear of losing.
How do Stanford athletes become inflicted with this Stanford Fever?
As a rule entering freshmen athletes show no sign of it. They are right from
high school, where they shined in their particular sport, where they were
regarded as stars, looked up to and worshipped as heroes. Many are usually
at Stanford on an athletic grant-in-aid. And they are often here with one
thought, to make good on the athletic field. These are stars who come to
Stanford with press clippings. But few of these are the ones who do well
during the season and look forward to their next big year as a sophomore.
And that year comes and goes without many sophomores being heard
from on the athletic field. Then there is the junior and senior years.
But by this time two years of Stanford life are tucked away and the star
athlete has learned a lot, has learned to live with and co-operate with
others, has learned what it is to he recognized for himself rather than
for his athletic ability, and above all has learned that Stanford people
don't put much on the fact that he was a high school star or a star in
his frosh year. He is accepted for what he is as a person. And he by this
time realizes that Stanford athletes aren't eased through school, that ath
letics are not stressed all the hours in the day, that the pressure of you
must win or else is not part of the Stanford athletic setup. He learns that
there are studies, social life, companionship, and a way of life at Stanford
which overshadows athletics.
And in the face of this is it any wonder that by the time the boy reaches
}>L third and fourth year that athletics, with rare exception, has lost some
of its importance, that it has taken a back seat to the more important things
of life and the boy realizes that athletics is not the ultimate as he believed
upon coming to Stanford? But athletics is just another phase of life and not
as important as his life's work for which Stanford is attempting to prepare
him.
Is it any wonder that his zeal, drive to win, work, talk and breathe
athletics may somewhat be lessened by the atmosphere around him? The
atmosphere that cries that there is something more to Stanford than ath
letics and at best athletics is only a means to an end and that end is the
better man. That is the Stanford Fever, the slow realization over a two or
thiee year period that athletics are but a game, a game to be played for
ttic fun and the spirit, and the good derived, not a game to be played for
the money, the glory and the Rose Bowl. As long as Stanford maintains
the philosophy of not going over board on athletics, Stanford Fever will
remain.
And is the Stanford Fever something that is bad? Something that should
be cured? Not at all.
Stanford is not a university that stresses athletics, rather it strives for
a better man, a man who can offer a bit of help in this tangled world.
Athletics at Stanford are secondary and only a means to that better man. !
That principle should never be altered.
And as long as it is maintained, entering high school stars with athletic
zeal and enthusiasm will find by their third and fourth years that zeal
and enthusiasm toned down and shifting from athletics to the more
important goals that Stanford offers.

letics and at best athletics is only a means to an end and that end is the
better man. That is the Stanford Fever, the slow realization over a two or
thiee year period that athletics are but a game, a game to be played for
ttic fun and the spirit, and the good derived, not a game to be played for
the money, the glory and the Rose Bowl. As long as Stanford maintains
the philosophy of not going over board on athletics, Stanford Fever will
remain.
And is the Stanford Fever something that is bad? Something that should
be cured? Not at all.
Stanford is not a university that stresses athletics, rather it strives for
a better man, a man who can offer a bit of help in this tangled world.
Athletics at Stanford are secondary and only a means to that better man. !
That principle should never be altered.
And as long as it is maintained, entering high school stars with athletic
zeal and enthusiasm will find by their third and fourth years that zeal
and enthusiasm toned down and shifting from athletics to the more
important goals that Stanford offers.
That is the Stanford Fever, but it is not bad.
The losses which Stanford athletic teams suffer may be partly blamed <ji
the tough admissions, the too few benefits or aids offered athletes, the
poor coaching, the poor material, and numerous other variables which al
times are called the reasons for losing teams. But we feel that often il
is something else, something we once heard referred to as the Stanford
Fever.
Stanford Fever is an intangible and it's a negative; of that there is little
doubt. Basically it is the lack of incentive and drive that seem to accom
pany so many Stanford athletic teams; it is the playing of the game for
the game's sake, not so much for the win or for the fear of losing.
How do Stanford athletes become inflicted with this Stanford Fever?
As a rule entering freshmen athletes show no sign of it. They are right from
high school, where they shined in their particular sport, where they were
regarded as stars, looked up to and worshipped as heroes. Many are usually
at Stanford on an athletic grant-in-aid. And they are often here with one
thought, to make good on the athletic field. These are stars who come to
Stanford with press clippings. But few of these are the ones who do well
during the season and look forward to their next big year as a sophomore.
And that year comes and goes without many sophomores being heard
from on the athletic field. Then there is the junior and senior years.
But by this time two years of Stanford life are tucked away and the star
athlete has learned a lot, has learned to live with and co-operate with
others, has learned what it is to he recognized for himself rather than
for his athletic ability, and above all has learned that Stanford people
don't put much on the fact that he was a high school star or a star in
his frosh year. He is accepted for what he is as a person. And he by this
time realizes that Stanford athletes aren't eased through school, that ath
letics are not stressed all the hours in the day, that the pressure of you
must win or else is not part of the Stanford athletic setup. He learns that
there are studies, social life, companionship, and a way of life at Stanford
which overshadows athletics.
And in the face of this is it any wonder that by the time the boy reaches
}>L third and fourth year that athletics, with rare exception, has lost some
of its importance, that it has taken a back seat to the more important things
of life and the boy realizes that athletics is not the ultimate as he believed
upon coming to Stanford? But athletics is just another phase of life and not
as important as his life's work for which Stanford is attempting to prepare
him.
Is it any wonder that his zeal, drive to win, work, talk and breathe
athletics may somewhat be lessened by the atmosphere around him? The
atmosphere that cries that there is something more to Stanford than ath
letics and at best athletics is only a means to an end and that end is the
better man. That is the Stanford Fever, the slow realization over a two or
thiee year period that athletics are but a game, a game to be played for
