LEGE may soon join the ranks of
schools using an honor system. A
tentative honor plan is being drawn
up by the school's Standards Com
mission to be presented to the stu
dent body for a referendum vote in
the coming spring elections.
At the UNIVERSITY OF CON
NECTICUT recently (according to
the school paper), a professor of so
ciology was lecturing on the social
customs and sex habits of a certain
African tribe when two embarrassed
young freshmen tried to make an
inconspicuous exit. Just as they
reached the door, the prof called
after them, "Don't go now, girls, the
boat doesn't leave until Monday!"
Nice guy .
If age is any academic criterion,
SC's standards are falling. Chil
dren five years of age may now
enroll. They're not taking up
seats in philosophy classes,
though. Seems the children are
taking music lessons 011 Satur
days.
UCLA's Executive Council re
cently voted to retire Ail-American

linebacker Donn Moomaw's football
jersey. No one else will ever wear
number 80 for UCLA.
Pending a million budget
grant from Gov. Earl Warren,
SAN JOSE STATE COLLEGE
will have new buildings added to
its campus. Plans are being made
for additions to the present sci
ence building, library, and men's
gymnasium.

weekend.
A recent poll taken at SMITH
COLLEGE, Massachusetts, showed
that sophomores do more class-cut
ting than other students. Fifty-eight
per cent of the class cut at least
once a week. Reasons? (1) Dull

out-of-town dates.

LEGE students, when they entered
their library during the Christmas
season, found the corridors filled
with low lights and soft music. A
WSC reporter describes the purpose
thus: "Students, overburdened with
attempts to gather the lights of
knowledge from some of the hun
dreds of thousands of nearby books,
should find the situation quite re
laxing." Looks as if Huxley's
"Brave New World" is closer than
we thought.
