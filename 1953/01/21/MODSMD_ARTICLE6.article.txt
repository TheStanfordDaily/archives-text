# Ike's Policies
## 
### 
We shall be guided by certain
fixed principles. These principles
are:
1. Abhorring war as a chosen
way to balk the purposes of those
who threaten us, we hold it to be
the first task of statesmanship to
develop the strength that will de
ter the forces of aggression and
promote the conditions of peace.
In the light of this principle, we
stand ready to engage with any
and all others in joint effort to re
move the causes of mutual fear
and distrust among nations, and
so to make possible drastic reduc
tion of armaments.
2. Realizing that common sense
and common decency alike dictate
the futility of appeasement, we
shall never try to placate an ag
gressor by the false and wicked
bargain of trading honor for se
curity.
3. Knowing that only a United
States that is strong and im
mensely productive can help de
fend freedom in our world, we
view our nation's strength and se
curity as a trust upon which rests
(he hope of fiee men everywhere.
4. Honoring the identity and
heritage of each nation of the
world, we shall never use our
strength to try to impress upon
another people our own cherished
political and economic institutions.
5. A ("sing realistically the
nÂ«eds and capacities of proven
friends of freedom, we shall strive
to help them to achieve their own
ecurity and well - being. Like
wise, we shall count upon them

to assume, within the limits of
their resources, their full and just
burdens in the common defense of
freedom.
6. Recognizing economic health
as an indispensable basis of mili
tary strength and the free world's
peace, we shall strive to foster ev
erywhere, and to practice our
selves, policies that encourage
productivity and profitable trade.
For the impoverishment of any
single people in the world means
danger to the well-being of all
other peoples.

7. Appreciating that economic
need, military security, and politi
cal wisdom combine to suggest re
gional groupings of free peoples,
we hope, within the framework of
the United Nations, to help
strengthen such special bonds the
world over. The nature of these
ties must vary with the different
problems of different areas.
8. Conceiving the defense of
freedom, like freedom itself, to be
one and indivisible, we hold all
continents and peoples in equal
regard and honor. We reject any
insinuations that one race or an
other, one people or another, is in
any sense inferior or expendable.
9. Respecting the United Na
tions as the living sign of all peo
pies' hope for peace, we shall
strive to make it not merely an
eloquent symbol but an effective
force. And in our quest of hon
orable peace, we shall neither
compromise, nqr tire, nor ever
cease.
