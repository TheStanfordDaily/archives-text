### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 21 (UP) -
Eight members of President Eisen
hower's cabinet were confirmed by
the Senate and sworn into office to
day but action on Charles E. Wilson
to be Defense Secretary was put off
indefinitely.
Despite the frantic efforts of Mr.
Eisenhower and his aides to find
: ome way out of their thorny di
lemma over Wilson's stock holdings,
there were some doubts that he
ever would take over the sprawling
deefnse establishment.
The eight cabinet members and
Mrs. Oveta Gulp Hobby, the new
Federal Security Administrator,
ware summoned to the White House
to take their oaths of office shortly
after the Senate unanimously con
firmed their nominations.
Before the Senate's approval by
voice vote, Sen. Wayne Morse, the
Oregon maverick, withdrew the ob
jection that had blocked immediate
confirmation Tuesday.
