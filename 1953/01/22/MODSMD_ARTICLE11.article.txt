### JANE LINDEMUTH 
"There is no freedom of
thought in China today," A.
Doak Barnett, Far Eastern au
thority, stated when he spoke
before 150 persons yesterday
in Cubberley Auditorium.
"A tremendous impact, reaching
from the top government into the
very bottom society levels, has been
dealt by the Communist revolu
tion," Barnett continued, "and
achievement ol power is only the
first step in a yet - uncompleted
long-range Communist China plan."
Barnett is a member of the
American Universities Field Staff,
an organization formed in 1951 of
which Stanford is one of eight spon
sors.
A result of Communist indoctri
nation is shown in parent-children
relations, lie said. Youth groups are
urged to give their loyalty to the
government first. Public denuncia
tions of parents are encouraged.
One daughter, according to Bar
nett, "publicly accused her father,
tile former president of one of Pe
king's universities, of being a "100
per cent claw of imperialism." Dur
ing a public hearing, the girl said,
"You are a hypocrite and I have
been cheated by you." After an
nouncing that her father had "hour
geois tendencies," and stating that
she hated him, the daughter con
tinued to say that her love and alle
giance noes only, to the "mass."
Barnett believes the Voice of
America radio is our "only weapon"
although, of the few Chinese pos
sessing radio sets, many are afraid
to listen for fear that their children
may repeat what they hear.
