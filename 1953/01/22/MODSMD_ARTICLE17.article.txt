## HR, Debate Activities Described 
### JIM MADISON 
Associate Editor, the Daily
Excom got an up-to-date brief
ing and review last night on the
operations ot two organizations
which represent two of the big
gest accounts in the ASSU bud
get, IIR anrf Debate Board.
Jim Roberts, outgoing president of
IIR, headed off the evening's program
of business with a description of the
six departments and the executive
board that comprise his organization.
Prefacing his remarks with: "I
! want to show you how our $2400
| share of the ASSU budget is being
| spont," Roberts described how Stan
ford's IIR, in particular its United
Nations Education Center, is held up
as a model to similar organizations
elsewhere.
"Or work in promoting interna
tional understanding is not only
giving Stanford much good publicity
both in personal and published re
; ports, but perhaps more important,
we serve as a valuable training
ground for future work on the pro
fessional level in promoting inter-
I national relations."
Roberts indicated that about. 100
students are currently on "active
duty" with the IIR and that 400 to
500 students participate in one or
more of its functions through the
year.
Before requesting an . additional
debate appropriation of $148 dollars
from Excom, Dave Jacobsen, Debate
Manager, explained the Debate
Board's activities and current pro
posals.
Jacobsen, who was almost left
out of the meeting by a premature
adjournment, declared that the
Debate Board heretofore mainly
concerned with straight debating
activities, was this quarter trying
to pay more attention to other for
ensic activities.
He said the board is considering
two proposals for reorganization: to
make the Board more representative
of various forensic activities; to di
vide up the job of debate manager.
The board will also experiment
this quarter with a Eating Club after
dinner speaking contest in an effort
to initiate living group speaking
tournaments.
The additional appropriation,
granted unanimously by Excom,
was to cover the expense entailed
in bringing to the campus a debate
team from Cambridge University,
England. The Englishmen will ap
pear April 10 as part of a national
tour.
Steve Horn, student manager, told
the Excom that the funds would have
been appropriated last spring if de
f lite arrangements for the debate
had been made.
