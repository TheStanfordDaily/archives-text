TOKYO, Thursday, Jan. 22 (UP) —The Chinese Communist radio
at Peiping said today Red fighter planes shot down an American
B-29 Superfort during a "special reconnaissance mission" over
Manchuria Jan. 12 and that 11 surviving members of its crew were
taken prisoner. .
Far East Air Force headquarters in Tokyo, however, said the

B-29 was attacked by 12 enemy air
craft well south of the Manchurian
boundary. FEAF said the plane dis
appeared after the attack.
Peiping said the B-29 was shot
down nine miles deep in Man -
churia and that 11 of 14 crewmen
who bailed out were captured.
Three crewmen were killed, Pei
ping said.
Communist Premier Chou En-lai
broadcast a protest, charging that
the B-29 as seeking to make a
"vicious strategic reconnaissance" of
Manchuria and represented one of a
series of "mad plots to expand the
war." He said it^ constituted "a se
rious threat to the peace of the
Far East and the world."
• Peiping said Red fighter planes
shot down the B-29 at 9:15 p.m.
over Wu Lung Pei, 11 miles
northwest of the big MIG-15 jet
base at Antung.
In a statement issued following
the Peiping broadcast, the U.S. Far
East Air Forces said the Superfort
was on a regularly scheduled mis
sion dropping psychological war
fare news leaflets over North Ko
rean cities.
"The aircraft was plotted and
followed throughout its flight by
friendly radar stations," FEAF
said.
"When over a town approximate
ly 12 to 15 miles south of the Yalu
River, the B-29 'plot' merged with
the 'plots' of 12 hostile fighter air
craft.
"The B-29 transmitted a 'May
day' (distress) signal and it is
presumed it was shot down at
that point.
"The B-29 was definitely over
North Korea, 12 to 15 miles inside
the border, when engaged by the
enemy planes.
"It disappeared from radar con
tact immediately after merging with
the 12 fighter plots.
