liere are other advantages of fraternities and
li;!'; which we may miss—everything from

exam files to free lodging across the country—
but these factors mentioned above are we feel,
the most significant.
On the other hand, what are the advantages
of independent life? Primarily, the freedom
of action allowed the independent is the
greatest advantage. He is not obliged to
spend time working on floats, cleaning up
the house, or doing similar tasks. Similarly,
he does not have to help foot the bills for the
club parties (the social obligations offered in
the smaller groups are not free) and other
group functions.
An example of the obligation avoided by the
independent is the reguirement that during
rush week fraternity members must spend open
house nights meeting prospective pledges and
attend every pledging function, or be fined.
It is the freedom from obligation which marks
the independent.
«
furthermore, membership in the club or fra
ternity is just another activity. And so the stu
dent considering membership should decide
just what he wants out of college and make his
choice accordingly.
Every club and fraternity is in a hypocri
tical position at this time of year, for they have
to ru£h many more fellows than they will ac
tually take. And so the problem facing the in
terested student is not always "to join or not
to join," but rather "will 1 be asked?"
The answer to this guestion cannot be given
here, but we do urge that you do not let a failure
to be asked ruin your life at Stanford. If you
feel that you must be a member of one of these
groups, keep in mind that the pledge classes
are not always filled immediately —spaces are
left open, and there's always next year, for a
good number of sophomores become members
of these groups every year.
Through it all, however, remember this—
there is no stigma attached to the independent.
He can go just as far as any other student in
campus life at Stanford.
