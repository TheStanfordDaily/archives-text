Reis, who makes all of his own puppets, will be on campus for
shows and lectures tomorrow and Saturday.
Kasper, Germany's do-gooder hand puppet, will be presented
to Stanford at the Little Theater tomorrow at 4:15 p.m. and Satur

and show is to introduce European
puppetry to an adult audience and
show how a puppet is made and
what it can do.
Reis, an exchange visitor from
Braunschweig, Germany, has
en shows for this purpose in New
York, Detroit, Chicago, Pitts
burgh, and Madison, Wis. He was
invited to come to the United
States for nine months of travel
and study. He chose to come to
Stanford.
Reis makes all his own puppets;
one, "Clown Eddy," which he made
when he was 17, has become his
trademark. He said that he became
interested in puppetry at the age of
13 when he broke his leg skiing,
began reading to pass the time, and
found a book on puppetry.
He went on to receive his Mas
ter's degree in puppetry at the
Werkhu.st Schule. He now teaches
one of Germany's top classes in
puppetry. He is also a teacher in
art education and the author of sev
eral books.
In his lectures tomorrow and
Saturday, Reis will discuss the
differences between American ami
European puppetry and show col
ored slides of the process of mak
ing puppets. He will talk about
such famous European puppets as
l'lincli, and then will give a real
puppet show with Kasper.
The show and lecture are prelim
inary to a course which the Speech
ind Drama Department hopes to of
fer in the near future—a course
which will provide practical in
truction in puppetry to art and
music students as well as drama
majors. The department also hopes
to give a number of children's
puppet shows which Reis will di
rect.
