## DEALING THE CARDS On Platoons and Things Football 
### 
When the NC2A fil ed the shot that killed platoon football and was heard
'round the sporting world, Chuck Taylor a man who has made himself
known in coaching circles in his two short years at Stanford was quoted
as saying. "I'm for it."
After spending some length talking over the .subject with Chuck he was
still in favor of it. He called it "a big step in the right direction." When
asked how it would effect our football future, he insured that it would do
us more good than harm.
Q: "How will it effect the present personnel of the squad?"
Chuck: "I can't say, most of the boys playing on the squad have had
experience playing both ways at one time or another. There won't be any
trouble on that score, and it should be an interesting spring practice."
Q: "What about this move from the midwest to postpone the ruling?"
Chuck: "They can't do a thing."
Q: "How about this idea of Pappy's to just change whole teams every
five minutes, or every quarter?"
Chuck: "Oh sure'they'll try it, they'll try anything. The best football
brains in the country will stay up nights trying to think up ways to beat
this new ruling. But whether it will work or not I can't say. Even Pappy
will have a little trouble finding 22 top grade players that can play both
ways."
Q: "How do you think the other schools in the league will shape up
undeV the new ruling?"
Chuck: "They'll do all light. I'm not worried about them. Cal's starting
lineup will read almost the same as their starting defense this year, and
the Bruin's have been prepping Cameron to take over the safety role."
I'appy Ain't Happy ami Neither Is Jess
A certain pair of coaches, one in the local area and one in the Southland,
have been moaning continually since this "foul effrontery to young Amer
ican athletes" was perpetrated by the rules committee. They have taken
on a holier than thou attitude that the two-platoon system let more boys
play ball. Actually, it let more boys play ball less. Football as played by
the big schools of the nation is a spectator sport in every sense of the word,
and the spectators should be allowed to witness the best boys play ball.
The answer to letting more boys play is simple—have more teams. Have
a Savages team and a Warrior team as well as a Frosh and Braves team.
Let more boys play more often. •
And what about the individual players who want to get jobs as coaches
when their playing and college clays are over. Take the case of Jess Cone,
all-coast defensive guard on the Rose Bowl team of 1951—he stepped right
into a head, coaching job of a high school upon graduation and hadn't
played one second of offensive ball in three years. He had to start from
scratch.
And did the two-platoon system actually let more boys play ball?
More boys might have played at Cal, but what about the many small
schools who dropped the game because they couldn't keep up with the
big school man-power, and the football players that went to these schools.
The only tragedy of the thing is that the ruling didn't come soon enough
to save some of the great independent names in football like St. Mary's
and Santa Clara. 0
All in all, we shall advance a prediction here. Football will enter a new
era of prosperity next year which will see many of the old timers who
had lost faith in the game returning. This plus the novelty of the new
situation plus the knowledge that they are going to see the BEST MEN
play will be just the ticket to boost football attendance yet higher.
On More Intersectionals
Many people have approached us on the subject of the Stanford football
schedule and the pros and cons of playing more big intersectionals and
fewer local independents. On the outside, we're for it, but there are other
things to be considerfed.
We went to Don Liebendorfer, affable information director of Stanford
Athletics and generally a good man to see, and talked over the problem
with him. He threw some new light on the subject that might be of interest.
For one thing, it takes an awfully good opponent to draw at Stanford
you need the "big name" to get them out. It isn't like Cal, where they
have enough alumni within a radius of 40 miles to iill their stadium.
Now most of the big names in college football have their schedules filled
out five years in advance under present conditions and this, says Mr.
Liebendorfer, is the main reason why we have only one big intersectional
a year. The long plan of the SAB is to schedule two a year, one at home
and one away.
Another thing that must not be forgotten is community pressure to play
local teams. This pressure is rapidly dying out as the ranks of the local
independents are thinning out, but this still leaves San Jose State.
Att"n, Excoin—Ketire 'Number 3'
We did a rare thing yesterday—we read the fourth page of the Daily.
There, in Sue Wheat's exchange column was an article from UCLA telling
of the retirement of number NO. Don Moomaw's number, from Bruin foot
ball. On this we would like to comment.
One number in over 50 years of football on the farm has been retired—
"number 1" of the immortal Ernie Nevers. This is a good thing in its
way. A retired number is the greatest honor that Stanford can give to an
athlete, and the students have seen fit to give it only once. At USC for
example, they have retired over a dozen letters, and have cheapened the
meaning behind this means of recognition.
From 1949-1951, an athlete graced the Stanford campus and athletic
fields name of Bill McColl. In 1950 he made first string ail-American as

defensive end. In 1951 he made first
string all-American as an offensive
end. In the words of Don Lieben
dorfer, who has been around long
enough to see all the greats go by,
"Bill McColl is the greatest lineman
in any position ever to play at Stan
ford." McColl could get on a field
against any team and against any
player, and you knew who was the
best man on that field. He never got
hurt—they couldn't hurt him. He
is a player par excellence—yet why
has the ASSU executive committee
not retired his number.
For one thing, it is claimed, they
didn't retire Frankie Albert's num
ber 13 or Bobbie Grayson's num
ber, and they were both two time
all-Americans. As for this, we don't
know about Grayson, but as far as
not retiring number 13 goes, two
wrongs don't make a right. The
fact that the excom of 1942 was

lethargic is no reason for (he excom of 1953 to follow suit. If the excom
did vote to retire number three, we have been assured that the passing
of the motion by the SAB would be a mere formality.
Another argument has been put up that Nevers was better. Our answer
is that we can't compare the two and wouldn't try. The game has changed,
and so has the vision of a football player that has been rehashed over and
over again in people's minds. He was great, and he'll probably always rank
among the all time greats of the game. When they throw around the names
of all lime great ends, McColl will be mentioned along with the names of
Brick Muller, Bernie Oosterbaan, Fred Hinkey, and other greats. If they
have to narrow it down to two men one of them probably won't be him.
And we aren't saying that there weren't better ends way back when.
What we are saying is that on the football fields, in the classroom, and
just around quad Big Bill was ranked with greatness. You can't cheapen
the praclice by retiring the jersey of someone like that. If there ever
is another athlete on the Farm that can rank with McColl, we hope that
we're alive to see it and young enough to still remember the good old days
when that big number 3 jersey would pop up between four defenders to
steal a victory for the Cardinals. Remember the Michigan game, remember
the Army game, remember the Sf game, remember the Big 7-7 tie.
As if we could ever forget.
