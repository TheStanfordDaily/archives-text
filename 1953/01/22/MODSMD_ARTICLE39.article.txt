# Dean, Simmons Make Hall Of Fame; DiMaggio Doesn't
## 
### 
Dizzy Dean and A 1 Simmons to
day received baseball's highest hon
or, membership in the Hall of Fame.
Joe DiMaggio, eligible for the
first time this year, wound up in
the voting, but he was undoubt
ly victim of an unwritten law
among the sportswriters that no
player shall be elected to the Hall
of Fame in his first year of eli
gibility.
Bill Terry, New York Giant first
baseman of the late twenties, was
seven votes short of the required
three-fourths for acceptance.

Dean, one of >
most colorful ]
characters in the
history of the
game, was the
last pitcher to
win 30 games.
In 1934, he won
30 and lost 7 as
he pitched the j
Cardinals to the >
world cham
pionship. .

His meteoric career was cut short
in the 1937 All-Star game when a
line drive off the bat of Earl Averill
of Cleveland broke his loot. Rather
than give his foot the proper medi
cal treatment, Dean altered his
pitching style. The change threw
out his arm.
At this time, the Cardinals sold
him to the Cubs for $175,000. He
was voted the most courageous
athlete of 1938 as he spot-pitched
the Cubs to the pennant. He won
seven out of eight although his
famous fast ball was gone. He
was a through pitcher when he

was 25 years old, but he still won
150 panies.

Simmons
sparked probab- |
ly the strongest j
team ever as
semb 1 e d , the [
1929 -31 Phila- !
delphia Athlet
ics. Simmons hit
.375 during
these threei
years, 40 points
higher than any-

one hit last year in either league.
In 1933, when Connie Mack broke
up his fabulous team, Simmons
went to the White Sox, who moved
home plate 30 feet nearer the left
field wall to celebrate his arrival.
Simmons hit 307 home runs in his
career and batted .334. He was fa
mous for his weird foot-in-the
bucket stance. â€”M. H.
