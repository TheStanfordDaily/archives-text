# Minto—Chaplain to All
## 
### WIN GRIFFITH 
Chaplain Robert Macfee Min
to works in a small office in the
vestry of Stanford Memorial
Church.
A student who enters that of
fice will meet a tall, lean middle
aged man who will ask in a no
ticeable Scottish accent "What's
on your mind?"
Whatever the purpose of his visit,
the student will learn that the chap
lain of Stanford University speaks
in a relaxed manner, is deeply con
cerned with the problems of the
individual, and does not care
whether the student before him is
Protestant, Catholic, Jew, or athe
ist.
The student will also iearn that
Chaplain Minto is conscientiously
aware of his defined duties as the
chaplain of a "non - sectarian,
non - denominational" university
church. But he feels that he is
required to do more than just
conduct the weekly services in
Memorial Church and co-ordinate
the religious activities on the
campus.
"The purpose of the Memorial
Church," Chaplain Minto explains,
"is to offer the members of the
Stanford community opportunities
in worship, counseling, and the pur
suit of knowledge."
"This community," he adds,
"has an opportunity to be brought
together by means of . corporate
worship, even though its members
arc deeply engaged in social ac
tivities and studies."
To help "bring the Stanford com
munity together," the chaplain
mentions such means as Memorial
Church itself, the YMCA, various
denominational groups, and courses
in religion.
"By such means," Chaplain Minto
says,"the student can understand
the nature of religion and the issues
it poses. The student should not be
acquiescent in his religion, he
should explore it. He should de
velop a knowledge of his own faith,
its history and its opportunities."
This week, with preparations
being completed for the special

program to celebrate the fiftieth
anniversary of the dedication of
the Memorial Church, Chaplain
Minto is aware of the progress the
Church has made in accomplish
ing its purposes of offering the
"opportunities for worship, coun
seling, and pursuit of knowledge."
But since 1947 when he first came
to Stanford, Caplain Minto also has
become aware of the need for ac
ceptance of himself and the church
by more Stanford students, and it
is toward this goal that he wishes
to exercise efforts to "break down
th'e idea in most students' minds of
the sanctified and pious mood of the
Memorial Church."
Chaplain Minto considers each
student an important person, and

he considers himself a ''chaplain
to nobody in particular and ev
erybody in general." He thus
welcomes any student visitor,
whether the meeting takes place
in his oflicc, on Quad, or in his
home at SU!) Lasucn Street.
He believes that the greater the
number of students who feel free to
speak to him, the easier it will be
to establish Memorial Church as a
place of worship and counseling to
all students.
And he believes that as soon as
this is accomplished Stanford Me
morial Church will strengthen the
position it has held for the past 50
years — the center of the Stanford
community.
