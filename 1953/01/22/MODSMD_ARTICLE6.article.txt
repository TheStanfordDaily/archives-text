# Juilliard Quartet Displays 'Sensitive Interpretation'
## 
### JANE GROW 
Those who were fortunate enough to attend the concert given
by the Juilliard String Quartet, which was presented by the Com
mittee on Public Exercises in Cubberley Auditorium last night,
spent a very rewarding evening.
The program opened with Schubert's "Quartet in E Major, Opus

125, No. 2," which is an extremely*
happy composition made up of four
short movements. The Quartet
handled its performance ably and
expressively, displaying a complete
understanding of the great music it
was playing.
The second work 011 the program,
Bela Bartok's "Quartet No. 5,"
proved to be a most interesting and
meritorious work, though perhaps
a little disjointed in parts, particu
larly during the slow movements.
The unusual effects which Bartok
has incorporated into this quartet
punctuate the general dissonant ef
fect in such a way that the over-all
impression one receives from the
composition is highly pleasing. The
members of the Juilliard group
showed themselves exceptionally
competent to perform this music, and
the facility whith which they exe
cuted the difficult composition was
remarkable.
Beethoven is said to have reached
the highest' pinnacle of quartet
writing, and this view was (irmly
substantiated by this "Quartet in
C Sharp minor, Opus l.'Jl" which
was the final work on last night's
program.
Having been written in seven
movements, this work displayed the
most outstanding richness of har
mony and its sheer musical beauty
could not be exceeded. The mem
bers of the Quartet gave a techni
cally excellent and adequately ex
pressive performance of the compo
sition; however, this reviewer felt
that it was slightly lacking in the
maturity of feeling required in
works by this composer.
The playing of the Juilliard
String Quartet was characterized
throughout by the utmost preci
sion, the finest blend, the most
amazing technical proficiency, the
most sensitive interpretation, and
a fresh and vigorous presentation
of all the works on (he program.


LAST NIGHT'S VIRTUOSOS—The Juilliard String Quartet, which has been called "one of Amer
ica's greatest contributions to quartet history" played last night in Cubberley Auditorium to an
enthusiastic audience. The musicians are, left to right, Raphael Hillyer, Robert Mann, Arthur
Winograd, and Robert Koff.

LAST NIGHT'S VIRTUOSOS—The Juilliard String Quartet, which has been called "one of Amer
ica's greatest contributions to quartet history" played last night in Cubberley Auditorium to an
enthusiastic audience. The musicians are, left to right, Raphael Hillyer, Robert Mann, Arthur
Winograd, and Robert Koff.
Those who were fortunate enough to attend the concert given
by the Juilliard String Quartet, which was presented by the Com
mittee on Public Exercises in Cubberley Auditorium last night,
spent a very rewarding evening.
The program opened with Schubert's "Quartet in E Major, Opus

125, No. 2," which is an extremely*
happy composition made up of four
short movements. The Quartet
handled its performance ably and
expressively, displaying a complete
understanding of the great music it
was playing.
The second work 011 the program,
Bela Bartok's "Quartet No. 5,"
proved to be a most interesting and
meritorious work, though perhaps
a little disjointed in parts, particu
larly during the slow movements.
The unusual effects which Bartok
has incorporated into this quartet
punctuate the general dissonant ef
fect in such a way that the over-all
impression one receives from the
composition is highly pleasing. The
members of the Juilliard group
showed themselves exceptionally
competent to perform this music, and
the facility whith which they exe
cuted the difficult composition was
remarkable.
Beethoven is said to have reached
the highest' pinnacle of quartet
writing, and this view was (irmly
substantiated by this "Quartet in
C Sharp minor, Opus l.'Jl" which
was the final work on last night's
program.
Having been written in seven
movements, this work displayed the
most outstanding richness of har
mony and its sheer musical beauty
could not be exceeded. The mem
bers of the Quartet gave a techni
cally excellent and adequately ex
pressive performance of the compo
sition; however, this reviewer felt
that it was slightly lacking in the
maturity of feeling required in
works by this composer.
The playing of the Juilliard
String Quartet was characterized
throughout by the utmost preci
sion, the finest blend, the most
amazing technical proficiency, the
most sensitive interpretation, and
a fresh and vigorous presentation
of all the works on (he program.
