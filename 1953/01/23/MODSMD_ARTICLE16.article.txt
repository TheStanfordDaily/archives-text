# Wilson Volunteers to Sell All General Motors Stock
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 (UP)
—President Eisenhower said to
night that Charles E. Wilson has
volunteered to dispose of his
General Motors stock and

promptly submitted his nomina
tion to the Senate to be Secre
tary of Defense.
Wilson's decision to sell his Gen
eral Motors stock, now valued at
some $2,700,000, apparently cleared
the major roadblock in the way of
his confirmation and solved the first
major crisis of the Eisenhower ad
ministration.
Sen. Harry F. Byrd (D., Va.), a
chief critic of the Wilson appoint
ment, said earlier that sale of the
stock would remove his objection
to the auto magnate's nomination.
He said disposal of the stock would
make Wilson "completely eligible."
Sen. Hugh Butler (R., Neb.),
however, had commented that Mr.
Eisenhower should appoint another
man for the job. He said the pres
ent impasse "puts us in a box po
litically" and there are plenty of
good men available. He was one of
the first, to state publicly what
many GOP Senators were saying
privately.
Press Secretary James C. Hagerty
announced the action in a two
sentence statement:
"The President has sent to the
Senate the nomination of C. E. Wil
son as Secretary of Defense. Mr.
Wilson visited the President this
evening and volunteered his inten
tion to dispose of all of his stock
in General Motors Corp."
Hagerty said he has no informa
tion yet on the submission of other
top Defense Department choices
which have been hold up along
wil.h the Wilson nomination.
Sen. Wayne Morse (Ind., Ore.),
who held up Mr. Eisenhower's
other cabinet appointments for
24 hours, indicated he is not satis
fied with the administration's solu
tion to the Wilson controversy. He
said he would not decide on his
own course of action until the
Armed Services Committee makes
its recommendation.
"I do not believe that mere pos
session of stock was the only dis
qualification of Mr. WiUion," Morse
said.
