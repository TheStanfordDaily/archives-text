# In the Heart of the University ...
## 
### 
With the church in the heart of the Univer
sity . . .
This was Stanford as it was originally laid
out, with the chapel not off in a quiet corner as
al many universities, but in the most prominent
pait of the Inner Quad, the area intended to be
the hub of student activity.
Plainly this shows that while the Stanfords
wanted the University to be non-denomina
tional, they did not intend for it to be irreligious.
Yet in many ways, that is exactly what has
happened.
Because denominational religious organiza
tions usually are forced to meet off-carnpus, for
fhe most part they are not nearly as active as
similar groups in other schools. Religious ac
tivity plays a very -small part in the average
student's life.
Even Memorial Church itself fails to meet the
student's needs in some degrees. In many
ways, it seems more a church for the elderly

intellectuals of Palo Alto than for the young
people of the University.
Attend the church some Sunday morning.
The people who fill the pews are largely gray
haired. Many of the students who attend as
freshmen are frightened away by sermons
which have little direct appeal for them. Even
the visiting speakers rarely aim their messages
toward young people.
We have an idea that if the Stanfords could
revisit their University today, they would be
shocked and unhappy at how small a part reli
gion plays in student life. We feel that this,
the 50th anniversary of the building of the
church, might be a good time for everyone con
cerned to reevaluate their policies toward reli
gion—the Board of Trustees, who interpret the
founding grant strictly; the Committee on Pub
lic Exercises, who make it hard for religious
groups to sponsor activities; even the Daily,
which by virtue of long-standing tradition,
largely limits religious notices to Once Around
the Quad.
