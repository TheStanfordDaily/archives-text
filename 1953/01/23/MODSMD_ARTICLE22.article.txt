# Women Wanted
## 
### 
We Stanford women are members of two
very important campus organizations —the' A
ssociated Women Students and the Women's
Athletic Association.
We pay dues each guarter: 50 cents per
woman is budgeted to WAA from BAC funds;
$2 from our tuition goes to the ASSU which ap
propriates a certain amount to AWS.
Belonging to an organization brings respon
sibilities—a responsibility to keep informed on
policies which affect the group and a respon
sibility to make sure we are represented by
qualified leaders.
This year for the first time AWS and WAA
are holding joint elections. Nominations open
Tuesday and continue until Thursday. Elec
tions v/ill be held in February. Both groups
want candidates—candidates who are willing to
work.
Certainly the projects undertaken by WAA
and AWS concern all women at Stanford. We

have watched with interest AWS' work on the
Lone Woman rule and on housing committee
procedure. We have participated in WAA's
play days and turned out for intramural games
and heard discussions on gym policies. Com
petent officers are needed to continue these
projects and to make other decisions which af
fect the women of the University.
It has been said that college women are re
luctant to run for offices. They'll take appoin
tive positions, but few women like to campaign
or make election speeches. We do not think
that this is the situation at Stanford. Note that
almost one-fourth of Excom are women. Note
also the number of women who have been
elected to head campus committees and organi
zations.
As an officer of AWS or WAA a woman gets
a chance to meet people, to receive training as
a future leader, and above all to give service
that will make college mean more than just
studies.—Ruby Bernstein
