### PETE GROTHE 
(Editor's note: The following Bull Session, which
appeared in last year's rushing edition, is reprinted
here by request.)
SOME WEATHER WE'VE BEEN HAVING
To most of those involved, rushing is a dead-serious
proposition. And yet, in any situation, no matter how
serious it may seem, elements of humor can always
he gleaned. One of the most tragically funny parts
of rushing is when the rusher and the rushee awk
wardly grope for conversation topics when all sub
jects have already been explored.
Picture, if you will, a rushee, whom we'll call Her-

nial i, and two fraternity or eating
club rushers whom we'll call Bill
and Jack.
Dinner is just over, and Bill and
Jack (on order of the rushing
chairman) sit down in a corner
with Herman to chew the fat.
Herman is a turkey, but he is a
hot prospect, because three other
organizations are after him.
Nine out of nine, the first sub
ject of conversation will be the

weather. "Well, this is some weather we've been
having, isn't it."
This may be said by one or all three at the same
time.
The weather is good for at least ten minutes.
Herman remembers that he stepped into a puddle
near the history corner, nearly soiling the pair of
argyles that his girl made for him last month.
"I hope they're not ruined," says Bill, straining to
conceal the fact that he really doesn't give a damn.
"Yeah, I hope they're okay," adds Jack.
Jack remembers that he saw a car stalled by the
ide of El Camino because it went through some deep
water, and Herman says he thinks more rain is on its
way.
Bill, having nothing more to contribute to the
nib ect of weather, repeats, "Yessir, some weather
we've been having lately."
Jack winds up the whole subject by saying some-'
thing witty like, ''Well, everyone talks about the
weather, hut no one ever does anything about it."
Bill and Herman laugh a hollow type of laugh, as

if someone has told a ioke they were just about to
tell.
There is a short pause, while everyone struggles to
figure out the next conversation piece. Bill remembers
that no one has asked Herman where he is from,
and so he says, "Where ya from, Herman?"
"Burnt Stump, lowa."
"Didja hear that, Jack? Herman, here, is from
Burnt Stump, lowa."
"Why," asks Herman, "Do you know someone in
Burnt Stump?"
'No," says Bill. "But I know a guy in Kansas City.
His name's Frank Sourwell. You know Frank?"
"No, I don't believe I do. Kansas City is about
a thousand miles from Burnt Stump."
"Oh,"' says Bill, giving up his end of the conver
sation.
Herman finishes, and Bill remebers that no one has
.mentioned the weather in several minutes. "Yessir,
some weather we've been having."
. A 90-second pause follows in which everyone takes
turns in clearing his throat.
"Say, you're living at Encina, aren't you Herman,"
queries Jack.
"Yeah."
"Then you must know Grant Swingely."
"He's a good head," offers Jack.
"Yeah, really a great guy," chips in Bill.
"Do you know Harry Appling over there," asks Bill.
"Yeah, really a good head."
"Sure is a great guy," adds Jack.
This goes on for several minutes until all mutual
acquaintances have been written ofl as either a "good
head" or a "great guy." Having exhausted all avail
able topics of conversation, the three sit stiffly with
their hands on their laps. They are frankly talked out.
After several minutes of this, each minute seeming
like an hour, Herman allows that, it is getting late
and that he really must return to Encina to do his
western civ. Jack mentions something about *t still
being early, but he is sure not to say it too loud, lest
Herman hear him. II Herman hears him, he pretends
not to.
Herman rushes for his coat, shakes hands, thanks
Bill and Jack, and leaves. As he goes out the door,
Bill shouts, "Be sure to button up that overcoat. This
is some weather we've been having lately."

if someone has told a ioke they were just about to
tell.
There is a short pause, while everyone struggles to
figure out the next conversation piece. Bill remembers
that no one has asked Herman where he is from,
and so he says, "Where ya from, Herman?"
"Burnt Stump, lowa."
"Didja hear that, Jack? Herman, here, is from
Burnt Stump, lowa."
"Why," asks Herman, "Do you know someone in
Burnt Stump?"
'No," says Bill. "But I know a guy in Kansas City.
His name's Frank Sourwell. You know Frank?"
"No, I don't believe I do. Kansas City is about
a thousand miles from Burnt Stump."
"Oh,"' says Bill, giving up his end of the conver
sation.
Herman finishes, and Bill remebers that no one has
.mentioned the weather in several minutes. "Yessir,
some weather we've been having."
. A 90-second pause follows in which everyone takes
turns in clearing his throat.
"Say, you're living at Encina, aren't you Herman,"
queries Jack.
"Yeah."
"Then you must know Grant Swingely."
"He's a good head," offers Jack.
"Yeah, really a great guy," chips in Bill.
"Do you know Harry Appling over there," asks Bill.
"Yeah, really a good head."
"Sure is a great guy," adds Jack.
This goes on for several minutes until all mutual
acquaintances have been written ofl as either a "good
head" or a "great guy." Having exhausted all avail
able topics of conversation, the three sit stiffly with
their hands on their laps. They are frankly talked out.
After several minutes of this, each minute seeming
like an hour, Herman allows that, it is getting late
and that he really must return to Encina to do his
western civ. Jack mentions something about *t still
being early, but he is sure not to say it too loud, lest
Herman hear him. II Herman hears him, he pretends
not to.
Herman rushes for his coat, shakes hands, thanks
Bill and Jack, and leaves. As he goes out the door,
Bill shouts, "Be sure to button up that overcoat. This
is some weather we've been having lately."

SOME WEATHER WE'VE BEEN HAVING
To most of those involved, rushing is a dead-serious
proposition. And yet, in any situation, no matter how
serious it may seem, elements of humor can always
he gleaned. One of the most tragically funny parts
of rushing is when the rusher and the rushee awk
wardly grope for conversation topics when all sub
jects have already been explored.
Picture, if you will, a rushee, whom we'll call Her-

nial i, and two fraternity or eating
club rushers whom we'll call Bill
and Jack.
Dinner is just over, and Bill and
Jack (on order of the rushing
chairman) sit down in a corner
with Herman to chew the fat.
Herman is a turkey, but he is a
hot prospect, because three other
organizations are after him.
Nine out of nine, the first sub
ject of conversation will be the

weather. "Well, this is some weather we've been
having, isn't it."
This may be said by one or all three at the same
time.
The weather is good for at least ten minutes.
Herman remembers that he stepped into a puddle
near the history corner, nearly soiling the pair of
argyles that his girl made for him last month.
"I hope they're not ruined," says Bill, straining to
conceal the fact that he really doesn't give a damn.
"Yeah, I hope they're okay," adds Jack.
Jack remembers that he saw a car stalled by the
ide of El Camino because it went through some deep
water, and Herman says he thinks more rain is on its
way.
Bill, having nothing more to contribute to the
nib ect of weather, repeats, "Yessir, some weather
we've been having lately."
Jack winds up the whole subject by saying some-'
thing witty like, ''Well, everyone talks about the
weather, hut no one ever does anything about it."
Bill and Herman laugh a hollow type of laugh, as

if someone has told a ioke they were just about to
tell.
There is a short pause, while everyone struggles to
figure out the next conversation piece. Bill remembers
