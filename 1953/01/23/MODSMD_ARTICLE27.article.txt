# No Money, No Troubles; Cellar's Angelo Is Happy
## 
### MARY FRAZER 
"Forty years in America and still
not rich. But I'm happy . . . and
everybody has his troubles," says
Ottavio Angeli, the familiar "An
gelo" of the Stanford Cellar.
Who is he and where did he
coine from? Angelo grew lip in
Mansarosa, Italy, a small town
near Luca in the northwest. His
father kept vineyards on a small
fann. When Angelo was ten, he
stopped going to school and
joined his four brothers and sis
ters in helping with the farm
work.
An older brother left the farm
and came to America, to work in
the Italian colony of Antioch, Cali
fornia. In 1913, after his eighteenth
birthday, Angelo came to join his
brother and make their fortunes.
No fortune came along, but An
gelo didn't seem to mind. He spent

the next 40 years moving from one
town to the next, finding a job, and
leaving each when he grew tired
of it. He lived in Oregon, Nevada,
and California on and off, and got
to know the Western states well in
his 40 years of "travel."
Angelo went back to school in
1943, this time in Los Angeles, to
study for the examinations for
U.S. citizenship. In September he
took the oath of allegiance and
received his final papersâ€”"a big
day in my life."
Angelo has never married; the
right girl hasn't come along yet.
"I'm still young, and you never can
tell," he says with a characteristic
shrug.
For the future, Angelo plans to
continue "to take things easy," as
he has been doing since 1913. "Ev
erybody at Stanford is very kind
and friendly. No money, but no
troubles either. I'm happy."
