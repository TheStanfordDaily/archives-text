# Frosh, JV's Play Pair
## Monterey College Is Bravesâ€™ Foe 
### 
Stanford Braves, defeated last
week for the first time this season,
face Monterey College tomorrow at
four o'colck. Tliere is no JV game
slated for this evening.
Though Coach George Lynn did
not announce a starting lineup, it
is probable that the Varsity players
left home from the Hawaii trip will
see the most action.
Though the starting lineup is un
certain, Sam Morley, Wayne Lock
hart, Wayne Culberson, and Jim
Johnson shofid see their share of
action.
