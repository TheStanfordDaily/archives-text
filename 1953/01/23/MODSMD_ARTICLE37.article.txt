# PRO FOOTBALL DRAFT
## Forty-Niners Get Bonus; Johnny O Goes to Cards 
### 
(In the first 14 rounds of selecting professional football players, there
were no Stanford men named.)
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 22 (UP)—The San Francisco 49ers, who
lost passing star Frankie Albert by retirement last season, sur
prised today by picking two ends as their first choices in the
National Football League's player draft.
The 49ers won the bonus draft, the free pull which entitles the

lucky club to a grab at any
eligible, and promptly tapped Harry
Babcock, the lanky Georgia end who
starred as a pass receiver for the
Bulldogs.
They bypassed passing stars Jack
Scarbath of Maryland who went to
Washington, and Ted Marchibroda
of Detroit who went to the Pittsburgh
Steelers, among others, and then on
their first turn around in the selec
tions, took end Tom Stolhandske of
Texas.
Washington came up with an
other all-American selection in ad
dition to Scarbath in tackle Dick
Modzelewski of Maryland. The
newcomer Baltimore Colts,
drawing first because of the Dallas
Texans' last place finish in their
one season, nailed two All-Amer
icans in Billy Vessels of Oklahoma
and Bernic Flowers, the end from
Purdue.
Coach Lawrence (Buck) Shaw of
the 49ers explained that his selection

of Babcock was "Because I want a
six-point end out there."
"We figured our need was greatest
there," Shaw said. "Y.A. Tittle and
Jim Powers will be available for
quarterback. Stolhandske is a line
backer as well as an offensive end."
The 49ers' other end is Gordie Sol
tau, an all-league choice who led
the league in scoring last season.
The player draft marked the first
day of the annual league meeting and
was due to last into the night as the
only business of the day.
San Francisco won its bonus with
a draw from a cardboard box by
general manager Lou Spadia. Other
eligibles for the free pick were
Cleveland, Pittsburgh, the Chicago
Cardinals, Green Bay and Balti
more.
Tlie highly touted Vessels, Okla
homa's offensive and defensive player
who also is a pass receiver, was
grabbed by Baltimore as its first
choice. Washington, picking next,
took Scarbath, and the Cardinals fol
lowed with John Olszewski, Califor
nia halfback.
In succession, Pittsburgh took
Marchibx - oda; The Chicago Bears,
Bill Anderson, a back from Comp
ton, Calif., Junior College; Green
Bay took A 1 Carmichael, back of
Southern California; the New York
Giants Bobby Marlowe, a back from
Alabama; the 49ers Stolhanske; the
Cleveland Browns tackle Doug At
kins of Tennessee; Los Angeles Ed
Barker of Washington State, and De
troit took Harley Sewell, a guard
from Texas.
The Philadelphia Eagles nabbed
Donn Moomaw, the great linbacker
from UCLA, but promptly turned
him over to the Los Angeles Rams
completing a trade from last
season.
The second round:
Baltimore, Bernie Flowers, Pur
due; Chicago Cards, Jim Psaltis,
USC; Washington, Dick Modzelew
ski, Maryland; Pittsburgh, John
