# Mrs. Stanford's Dream Came True
## Her Church Is 50 Years Old Today 
### TONY HODGE 
On the beautiful sunny morn
j ing of Jan. 25, 1903, a crowd of
Bay Area residents overflowed
; the newly-erected quadrangle
of the Leland Stanford Junior
University. They had come to
witness the dedication of the Uni
versity's much-celebrated Me
morial Church.
With all due reverence, the Rev.
R. Hever Newton officially dedicat
ed the Church "to the glory of God
and uses of religion." And the
; Church—the sole preoccupation of
Mrs. Stanford in her later years—
was ready to begin its long career
of service to the community and
the University.
Mrs. Stanford built the Church
as a memorial to her husband.
She .spent long tedious months in
Europe searching for just the
right materials, designs, and
methods of decoration.
The late Charles E. Hodges, resi
dent architect of the Church in
1902, later recalled Mrs. Stanford's
interest in the building.
He said: "Mrs. Stanford went into
every detail of the plans, which she
could read like an expert, and
would follow on the scaffolding,
holding my coattails. She invari
ably carried a parasol, notched at
the lower end, which she would
run into the carving, obtained from
some cathedral in Europe, and if
it did not come up to the mark,
she would ask me to have it cut a
little deeper."
Mrs. Stanford once confided to
Dr. John Casper Branncr, presi
dent emeritus, "While my whole
heart is in this University, my
soul is in that Church."
To its founder the Church stood
for highmindedness and upright
ness. Centrally located in the mid
dle of the Quad, the Church was to
symbolize the centrality of spiritual
life on campus. What Mrs. Stanford
felt then remains as the basic ideal
today—that the Church should play
an integral part in every student's
life.
Her hope and desire is well on
the way to being fulfilled, as
every year more and more stu
dent religious organizations arise
to take their place in University
life.
Since the Church opened it has
been the scene of 2,861 weddings
of present and former students and
faculty members, the only persons
who may be married there.
Before 1914 only four couples
were married in the Church, but in
1952, 79 weddings took place, and in
recent years arrangements for wed
dings have been made by alumni

living as far away as New York.
As one approaches the Church
through the court of Inner Quad,
the first thing he sees is its bril
liant facade, a mosaic depicting the
Sermon on the t Mount.
The many mosaics in the
Church are all imported works
from Venice, based on fifteenth
century models, including the

artistry of Michelangelo from the
Sistine Chapel.
The earthquake of 190(5 destroyed
much of the Church. Its original
high Gothic tower collapsed into
the middle of the building, and lit
erally blew out its front and rear
ends. The tower was replaced by
a temporary tile roof which re
mains today.

a high gothic tower rose above the structure of Stanford Me
morial Church. The tower collapsed in the earthquake.
On the beautiful sunny morn
j ing of Jan. 25, 1903, a crowd of
Bay Area residents overflowed
; the newly-erected quadrangle
of the Leland Stanford Junior
University. They had come to
witness the dedication of the Uni
versity's much-celebrated Me
morial Church.
With all due reverence, the Rev.
R. Hever Newton officially dedicat
ed the Church "to the glory of God
and uses of religion." And the
; Church—the sole preoccupation of
Mrs. Stanford in her later years—
was ready to begin its long career
of service to the community and
the University.
Mrs. Stanford built the Church
as a memorial to her husband.
She .spent long tedious months in
Europe searching for just the
right materials, designs, and
methods of decoration.
The late Charles E. Hodges, resi
dent architect of the Church in
1902, later recalled Mrs. Stanford's
interest in the building.
He said: "Mrs. Stanford went into
every detail of the plans, which she
could read like an expert, and
would follow on the scaffolding,
holding my coattails. She invari
ably carried a parasol, notched at
the lower end, which she would
run into the carving, obtained from
some cathedral in Europe, and if
it did not come up to the mark,
she would ask me to have it cut a
little deeper."
Mrs. Stanford once confided to
Dr. John Casper Branncr, presi
dent emeritus, "While my whole
heart is in this University, my
soul is in that Church."
To its founder the Church stood
for highmindedness and upright
ness. Centrally located in the mid
dle of the Quad, the Church was to
symbolize the centrality of spiritual
life on campus. What Mrs. Stanford
felt then remains as the basic ideal
today—that the Church should play
an integral part in every student's
life.
Her hope and desire is well on
the way to being fulfilled, as
every year more and more stu
dent religious organizations arise
to take their place in University
life.
Since the Church opened it has
been the scene of 2,861 weddings
of present and former students and
faculty members, the only persons
who may be married there.
Before 1914 only four couples
were married in the Church, but in
1952, 79 weddings took place, and in
recent years arrangements for wed
dings have been made by alumni

living as far away as New York.
As one approaches the Church
through the court of Inner Quad,
the first thing he sees is its bril
liant facade, a mosaic depicting the
Sermon on the t Mount.
The many mosaics in the
Church are all imported works
from Venice, based on fifteenth
century models, including the

artistry of Michelangelo from the
Sistine Chapel.
The earthquake of 190(5 destroyed
much of the Church. Its original
high Gothic tower collapsed into
the middle of the building, and lit
erally blew out its front and rear
ends. The tower was replaced by
a temporary tile roof which re
mains today.
