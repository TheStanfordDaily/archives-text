# Researchers Curb Cancer in Mice
## 
### 
Drug compounds of furan, a col
orless liquid obtained from peanut
shells, which appears to stop or
slow down the growth of cancer
tumors in mice, have been devel
oped by Stanford researchers.
Experiments employing 13 differ
ent types of furan derivatives in
tests on the mice were carried out
at the Stanford University School of
Medicine in San Francisco. The re
sults are reported in the current
issue of the Stanford Medical Bul
letin by Dr. Windsor C. Cutting,
head of the Department, of Phar
macology and Therapeutics, Dr.
Robert H. Dreisbach, and Fusaka
Matsushima.
The scientists have cautioned that
tfyeir experiments were far from
conclusive.
