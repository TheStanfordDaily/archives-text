## 
### HADLEY ROFF Daily Political Editor 
John Beggs, Stanford junior,
returned Friday from Washing
ton D.C. where he attended the
inauguration ceremonies as a
member of California's official
Republican family. ,
Beggs, who is co-chairman of the
Young Republicans of California,
was one of 13 leading California
Republicans, including Governor
Earl Warren, to attend the gala
Washington festivities in an official
capacity.
While in the capital, Beggs had
long and private talks with such
notables as Major General Lewis B.
Hcrshey, director of the draft; Sen
ator Robert A. Taft; Representative
Pal. Hillings, 25th California Dis
trict; and others.
On Monday, the California dele
gation held a reception attended by
Republican notables from across
the country. Vice-President Rich
ard Nixon, then still Senator Nixon,
was one of the first to come and
the last to leave, according to
Beggs.
During (lie reception, Beggs,
who knows Nixon quite well,
chatted with him and his wife,
the now-famous "I'at." Me also
talked with Thomas 11. Kuchel,
former California Controller and
now U.S. Senator. Hr described
the state's new junior Senator as
a "vibrant, alive individual with
n lot of good ideas."
That night., he attended the Re
publican Festival, a joy - packed
i show staged by Hollywood stars,
including Charlie McCarthy and
! Edgar Bergen, John Wayne, and
others. There he met Senator Taft.
Tuesday was the big day, the day
the Republicans had waited 20
years to witness.
General Eisenhower was re
i christened President Eisenhower.

Beggs, as member of the official
family from the Golden State, sal
directly in front of the White
House balcony where Eisenhower

repeated his oath and announced
his now-famous nine points.
Almost breathlessly, Beggs de
scribed the inaugural ceremonies

as very impressive.
Then, in a partisan aside, he
added that the ceremony was de
layed slightly by now-Ex-President
Harry Truman "who apparently
wouldn't be hurried."
The dizzy, exciting Washington
whirl ended Tuesday night, at, the
traditional inaugural ball, a thrill
ing event, according to Bcggs.
President Eisenhower and "Ma
mie" attended the gala hall for an
hour and a half. Bcggs said Mamie
was a "radiant, wonderful-looking
person."
While in Washington, he said,
he was impressed by 'he deter
mined, work-prone attitude of the
| Republicans.
He said, "In spite of all the fun
there was a definite attitude of
sobriety and earnestness on the
part of the Republicans."
Of early changes contemplated bv
j Republicans, a swift alteration in
the procedures of the Civil Service
Commission is indicated, Beggs
said.
He said that everyone is well
j aware "that nothing is going to
change over night."
"But changes will be made," the
Stanfordite declared.
There will also be an overhaul
ing and streamlining of the Depart
ment of Defense, according to
Beggs.
Turning to a favorite target of
I Republican jeers, the independent
Senator from Oregon, Wayne
Morse, Beggs said he is considered
an "obnoxious whippersnapper" hy
Republicans and Democrats alike,
A similar attitude, he said, ex
ists toward Senator Joseph Mc-
Carthy CR.. Wis.). He added,
1 however, that most Washington
officials are hesitanl to do any
thing about McCarthy and his
super-dramatic Red hunts, point
ing out that he was duly elected
by the people of Wisconsin and
that the rest of the nation must
I respect their will.

On Monday, the California dele
gation held a reception attended by
Republican notables from across
the country. Vice-President Rich
ard Nixon, then still Senator Nixon,
was one of the first to come and
the last to leave, according to
Beggs.
During (lie reception, Beggs,
who knows Nixon quite well,
chatted with him and his wife,
the now-famous "I'at." Me also
talked with Thomas 11. Kuchel,
former California Controller and
now U.S. Senator. Hr described
the state's new junior Senator as
a "vibrant, alive individual with
n lot of good ideas."
That night., he attended the Re
publican Festival, a joy - packed
i show staged by Hollywood stars,
including Charlie McCarthy and
! Edgar Bergen, John Wayne, and
others. There he met Senator Taft.
Tuesday was the big day, the day
the Republicans had waited 20
years to witness.
General Eisenhower was re
i christened President Eisenhower.

Beggs, as member of the official
family from the Golden State, sal
directly in front of the White
House balcony where Eisenhower

repeated his oath and announced
his now-famous nine points.
Almost breathlessly, Beggs de
scribed the inaugural ceremonies

as very impressive.
Then, in a partisan aside, he
added that the ceremony was de
layed slightly by now-Ex-President
Harry Truman "who apparently
wouldn't be hurried."
The dizzy, exciting Washington
whirl ended Tuesday night, at, the
traditional inaugural ball, a thrill
ing event, according to Bcggs.
President Eisenhower and "Ma
mie" attended the gala hall for an
hour and a half. Bcggs said Mamie
was a "radiant, wonderful-looking
person."
While in Washington, he said,
he was impressed by 'he deter
mined, work-prone attitude of the
| Republicans.
He said, "In spite of all the fun
there was a definite attitude of
sobriety and earnestness on the
part of the Republicans."
Of early changes contemplated bv
j Republicans, a swift alteration in
the procedures of the Civil Service
Commission is indicated, Beggs
said.
He said that everyone is well
j aware "that nothing is going to
change over night."
"But changes will be made," the
Stanfordite declared.
There will also be an overhaul
ing and streamlining of the Depart
ment of Defense, according to
Beggs.
Turning to a favorite target of
I Republican jeers, the independent
Senator from Oregon, Wayne
Morse, Beggs said he is considered
an "obnoxious whippersnapper" hy
Republicans and Democrats alike,
A similar attitude, he said, ex
ists toward Senator Joseph Mc-
Carthy CR.. Wis.). He added,
1 however, that most Washington
officials are hesitanl to do any
thing about McCarthy and his
super-dramatic Red hunts, point
ing out that he was duly elected
by the people of Wisconsin and
that the rest of the nation must
I respect their will.
