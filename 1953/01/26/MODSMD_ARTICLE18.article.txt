# Fraternity Rushing Nears End
## Pledge Card Signing Is Tonight; Clubs Still Seeking New Members 
### 
Fraternity rushing spins to an end tonight with the signing of
pledge cards in ceremonies at the Nitery. For the clubs, the rush
ing period continues, booming along at full throttle.
The clubs have no formal rushing periods, each governing
it3 own rushing procedure.
The festive card signing session for fraternities is scheduled to

get underway at 7:30 p.m., and a
half hour later, it is expected, Stan
ford will have a new crop of pledge
classes.
According to word from the Inter-
Fraternity Council, Stanford's 24
houses plan to pledge about 350 stu
dents. The clubs, according to the
Inter-Club Council, anticipate 100
pledges.
The fall quarter rushing whirl
whizzed into action January 7
when the seven clubs hosted at
open houses. The fraternities be
gan their round of open houses on
January 12.
This past week the clubs and the
Greek lettered houses have enter
tained freshmen and other potential
pledges at a number of lively dinners
and parties.
Clubs and fraternities alike will
host pledges at banquets tonight,
scheduled for 6.
Within the month, most of the
groups will further welcome their
pledges at pledge dances and balls.
Following the banquets, the ac
tive fraternity members will escort
the pledges to the Nitery for the
card signing, the final rushing act.
Cards signed are binding, and a
student who breaks a fraternity
pledge after signing a card is barred
from pledging another house for two

quarters. This long standing rule
will be strictly enforced, representa
tives of the Inter-Fraternity Council
say.
The Council also warns houses to
check carefully the eligibility of
pledges, pointing out that freshmen
with less than one quarter resi
dence at the University are inel
igible.
The clubs, operating under less
rigid rush rules than the houses
have no formal card signing event.
The procedure of formalizing mem
bership is left to each club.
