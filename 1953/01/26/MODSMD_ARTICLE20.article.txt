### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 (UP) -
A majority of the Senate Armed
Services Committee lined up today
behind demands that President Ei
senhower's prospective Secretaries
of the Army and Ah- Force sell
their stock in companies doing bus
iness with the government.
Charles E. Wilson is certain to
he confirmed by the Senate as
Defense Secretary, possibly to
morrow. But a poll of the 15-
member committee showed at
least eight members are opposed
to Wilson's plan to let his aides
retain their stock.
President Eisenhower will be in
formed of this sentiment when he
holds his first regular weekly meet
ing with top Republican Congres
sional leaders tomorrow. Senate
GOP chief Robert A. Taft said the
entire controversy probably will be
discussed.
Involved are Robert T. B. Ste
vens, Army Secretary - designate,
and Harold E. Talbott, prospective
Air Force Secretary. They appar
ently faced the choice of following
Wilson's lead and selling their
stocks or foregoing the military
posts.
