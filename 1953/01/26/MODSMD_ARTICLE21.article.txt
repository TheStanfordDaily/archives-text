### 
Every Stanfordite will be
contacted for the Winter Quar
ter Charity Drive, scheduled for
the week of Feb. 16 to 20, ac
cording to Don Lozabnick, chairr
man.
This year's drive has been de
signed to solicit funds for the Red
Cross and for the World Univer
sity Service (formerly WSSF).
Lozabnick, Winter Drive Com
mittee head, has said that "every
student attending Stanford and ev
ery faculty member employed by
Stanford will be reached by solici
tors for this, the biggest charity
drive ever planned at Stanford."
Members of A Phi O and campus
"Y" groups will enlist 200 student
solicitors for the drive. The solici
tors (100 men and 100 women) will
"pair of!" and work in ten separate
areas of student residence.
The Drive Committee will send
speakers to University residences,
clubs, and other groups to explain
the details and purposes of the
drive. Tentative plans for special
events include a faculty - student
basketball game, movies, a parade,
a fashion show, and special pub
licity displays on campus.
Proceeds from the drive will be
shared by the Red Cross and by
World University Service after a
three per cent deduction for the
ASSU "Charity Sinking Fund."
World University Service, until

this year known as "World Student
Service Fund," is an international
organization which acts as an
agency to channel aid from Ameri
can universities and colleges to
those in foreign and "less fortu
nate" countries.
In past years Stanford has used
WUS to "help students to help
themselves." Contributions from
Stanford students have aided for
eign students in purchasing mimeo
graphing machines, food, clothing,
books, and other school equipment.
Lozabnick has announced the
following appointments:
Bob James, on - campus solicita
tion; Monica Vardeman, off-campus
solicitation; Elena Bosworth, fac
ulty solicitation; Norm Lenzer,
pledges; Larry Tarlow, publicity
for WUS; Walt Parks, publicity for
