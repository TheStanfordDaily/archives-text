# A 						National Experiment
## 
### 
President Eisenhower last week embarked on
a national experiment.
If your Republican friends are like ours,
they've been complaining for a long time about
inefficiency in Washington . . .about waste in
political operations . . . about government by
politicians. "Conditions exist which simply
wouldn't be tolerated in private business,"
they've been telling us.
Well, now they have the chance to try their
way. Their newly inaugurated leader is setting
out on his four-year term with an Administra
tion staffed with top flight businessmen.
Wilson, Humphry, Dodge, Weeks, Summer
field—these are men skilled in the management
of large amounts of money and numbers of men
. . . skilled in riding herd on big complex or
ganizations. They could never be labelled
"machine politicians."
So an attempt will be made to run the federal
government as it was, the biggest business of
all. The question—is it?
The prime objective of business is to make
a profit. Correct us if we're wrong, but we con
sider the prime object of government the wel
fare of all its citizens.
The counter argument, of course, is that an
efficiently run government is a major contribu
tion to the public welfare. We grant this. Un

doubtedly taxes are a severe hardship to many.
Undoubtedly unnecessary waste works against
the public good.
So we applaud the Eisenhower Administra
tion for its plans to give the American people
on a more efficient and economical basis the
benefits they have now.
The areas we are concerned about are rather
those where the new administration will have
to choose between economy and the public
good. It has been said of the New Deal that
although it cost a lot, it provided priceless in
crease in the self-respect of the individuals
caught in the )-aws of the depression.
On the surface it might seem more econom
ical to set up a bread line th&n to put men to
work planting trees In wind breaks. The dif
ference is that a man feels a whole lot better
when he knows he is at least partially earning
his own way than when he is completely de
pendent on direct charity.
It seems to us that there is a desirable middle
road down which a government can go where
efficiency is concerned. This road avoids waste
on one side and inhumanity on the other.
It will be interesting to see if Eisenhower's
experiment can follow this middle way and if
after four years, the American people find that
it is what they want.
