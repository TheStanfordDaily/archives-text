### DICK MANSFIELD 
Zuverink had great faith in the ability of his Terra
plane to speed down Bayshore, wrap corners, peel,
dig, scratch, and stop on a two-yen note. Besides
doing all these things, Zuverink's Terraplane doublet!
as a fairly decent automobile, one in which a Ventura
girl would be proud to ride. Zuverink was more than

a little heartbroken when, after
having proved to the Boys that
the Terraplane would do 107 on
Bayshore, he launched a demon
stration of corner-wrapping and
wrapped instead a telephone pole.
Zuverink brooded for some
time over the fate of his Terra
plane. While he was still up at
the Rest Home, the Boys had
taken a basket and brought the
Terraplane and dumped it in a

pile in Zuverink's room. Zuverink would sit and stare
at the mass of rubble between lectures. Never would
he have another car that would stop on a two-yen
note.
Then Zuverink decided to build the ideal Stanford
automobile, h masterpiece that would never again
he approached for utility, versatility, and beauty
on the Stanford campus. He had to admit that some
turkey named Smurg had had a Hupmobile that
might have done 107 on Bayshore, hut even Smurg
would moan low when Zuverink zoomed by in his
Zuv Special.
He built the Zuv Special off the wreckage of the
Terraplane, of little secret devices obtained from
electronics firms in the East, and of such panelling
and parts as he could detatch from Smurg's Hup
mobile while Smurg was on Bird Watching field trips.
The end result of Zuverink's planning and labor
was every bit as beautiful as Zuverink had imagined.
It was a long, low car, with a very narrow front

seat of maximum capacity two, and a back seat wide
enough for four. Instead of brakes, Zuverink installed
an exhaust whistle to be manipulated by foot at high
speeds. The Special had only two speeds forward—
low and high. For starts, Zuverink had JATO. An
artistic buddy etched a special all-campus perpetual
parking tag on the inside of the back window.
The wheels on the left side of the Special would
retract four inches to permit parking on the side
walk during a stop at the post office. The Special
had a radio that would pick up both K(i() and
Tijuana, simultaneously or one at a time. The
Special had a jury windshield for fraternity and
school decals and Mexican travel stickers.
Zuverink even had a form of radar. A special
electronic device set off a fire gong mounted under
the driver's seat if any police car within ten miles
picked up speed suddenly. This electronic marvel was
the work of a couple of Stanford electrical engineer
ing graduates at MIT, who had plenty of practice on
Boston police.
For super speed, Zuverink could slip the Special
into high high and do 136. For wrapping corners,
the Special was jointed in the middle. And further
more, in accordance with accepted style in driving,
Zuverink had a swivel chair behind the driver's
seat and could, if desired, drive while leaning cas
ually against the left front door.
Zuverink's greatest moment came when he chal
lenged Smurg to race up Bayshore. Zuverink held
the Special in until Smurg had the Hupmobile up to
its 107 maximum. Then, craftily, Zuverink took the
Special up to 110. At 108, Smurg's Hupmobile hit the
sonic barrier and disintegrated. Smurg emerged
from the puff of smoke unhurt but running very fast,
and never stopped running until he got back to
Detroit und stayed there.

the Special was jointed in the middle. And further
more, in accordance with accepted style in driving,
Zuverink had a swivel chair behind the driver's
seat and could, if desired, drive while leaning cas
ually against the left front door.
Zuverink's greatest moment came when he chal
lenged Smurg to race up Bayshore. Zuverink held
the Special in until Smurg had the Hupmobile up to
its 107 maximum. Then, craftily, Zuverink took the
Special up to 110. At 108, Smurg's Hupmobile hit the
sonic barrier and disintegrated. Smurg emerged
from the puff of smoke unhurt but running very fast,
and never stopped running until he got back to
Detroit und stayed there.

Zuverink had great faith in the ability of his Terra
plane to speed down Bayshore, wrap corners, peel,
dig, scratch, and stop on a two-yen note. Besides
doing all these things, Zuverink's Terraplane doublet!
as a fairly decent automobile, one in which a Ventura
girl would be proud to ride. Zuverink was more than

a little heartbroken when, after
having proved to the Boys that
the Terraplane would do 107 on
Bayshore, he launched a demon
stration of corner-wrapping and
wrapped instead a telephone pole.
Zuverink brooded for some
time over the fate of his Terra
plane. While he was still up at
the Rest Home, the Boys had
taken a basket and brought the
Terraplane and dumped it in a

pile in Zuverink's room. Zuverink would sit and stare
at the mass of rubble between lectures. Never would
he have another car that would stop on a two-yen
note.
Then Zuverink decided to build the ideal Stanford
automobile, h masterpiece that would never again
he approached for utility, versatility, and beauty
on the Stanford campus. He had to admit that some
turkey named Smurg had had a Hupmobile that
might have done 107 on Bayshore, hut even Smurg
would moan low when Zuverink zoomed by in his
Zuv Special.
He built the Zuv Special off the wreckage of the
Terraplane, of little secret devices obtained from
electronics firms in the East, and of such panelling
and parts as he could detatch from Smurg's Hup
mobile while Smurg was on Bird Watching field trips.
The end result of Zuverink's planning and labor
was every bit as beautiful as Zuverink had imagined.
It was a long, low car, with a very narrow front

seat of maximum capacity two, and a back seat wide
enough for four. Instead of brakes, Zuverink installed
an exhaust whistle to be manipulated by foot at high
speeds. The Special had only two speeds forward—
low and high. For starts, Zuverink had JATO. An
artistic buddy etched a special all-campus perpetual
parking tag on the inside of the back window.
The wheels on the left side of the Special would
retract four inches to permit parking on the side
walk during a stop at the post office. The Special
had a radio that would pick up both K(i() and
Tijuana, simultaneously or one at a time. The
Special had a jury windshield for fraternity and
school decals and Mexican travel stickers.
Zuverink even had a form of radar. A special
electronic device set off a fire gong mounted under
the driver's seat if any police car within ten miles
picked up speed suddenly. This electronic marvel was
the work of a couple of Stanford electrical engineer
ing graduates at MIT, who had plenty of practice on
Boston police.
For super speed, Zuverink could slip the Special
into high high and do 136. For wrapping corners,
the Special was jointed in the middle. And further
more, in accordance with accepted style in driving,
Zuverink had a swivel chair behind the driver's
