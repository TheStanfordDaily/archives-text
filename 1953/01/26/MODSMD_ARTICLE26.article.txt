To the Editor:
The statement in your recent story of the Stanford
Bookstore that the earthquake of 1906 "caused slight
damages" to the building is a great surprise to the
oldtimers. The directors of that day would have been
greatly relieved if they had not had to add to their
current debt by more borrowing for reconstruction.
The building had been erected of brick (hidden by
stucco covering). The mortar had not sufficiently
"set" so that it was soft and not able to resist the
movement of the quake. The corner where the vault
was held fast and may have prevented complete des
truction. The roof was propped up and the walls were
rebuilt, thi« time with cement mortar, with the result
that later, when a door was cut through, a job that was
expected to last a day or two lan into some weeks.
The writer went into bookstore service soon after
rebuilding wa*> finished and remained until lf)20, the
last six years as manager.

'Surprise, Disappointment'

To the Editor:
I received through the mail this morning an en
velope from the Controller's Office bearing an adver
tising post mark which depicted the Hoover Tower
and said "Make the most of your summer at STAN
FORD."
Great was my surprise and disappointment when
I s*sw that an institution of high standing and reputa
tion resorts to such distasteful para-commerical prac
tices that can have nothing but a very detrimental
effect on the name and prestige of our Alma Mater.
I, and I reckon, many of my fellow students cannot
help deploring that unfortunate circumstance, hardly
in keeping with the standards of the academic world,
and feel confident that it will be remedied very
shortly.
