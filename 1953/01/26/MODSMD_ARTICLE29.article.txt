"A good research man must have
intellectual honesty, fundamental
knowledge of engineering subjects,
imagination, initiative, resourcefull
ness, and the ability to think inde
pendently," said T. A. Boyd of Geneal
Motors Research Laboratories when
he spoke Wednesday to a group of
Stanford student engineers.
"Whether your job is to build
bridges or roads, to design automo
biles or Diesel locomotives or to aid
in some defense program, you are
going to find a need for knowledge
not in your head or in books," Boyd
continued.
Boyd collaborated with Charles F.
Kettering and the late Thomas
Midgley, Jr., in the discovery of
tetraethyl lead as an anti - knock
compound for automotive and avi
ation fuels.
In illustrating the many oppor
tunities open for young engineers,
Boyd stated that over one-half the
young engineers employed in the
GM research laboratories and other
experimental divisions are holders of
bachelor's degrees.
Concluding his talk, Boyd said that
most research today is completed in
group research so the young engineer
need not work alone or unaided.
"Younger men in the field thus have
the opportunity to learn methods of
successful experimentation by work
ing with others more experienced."
