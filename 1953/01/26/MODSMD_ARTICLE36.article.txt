# THE 						DU PONT DIGEST
## THE 						TECHNICAL MAN IN Production Supervision Scientists who know both people and processes are needed to keep Du Pont's 71 plants humming 
### 
Keeping production rolling in a mod
ern industrial plant is a job that ap
peals to men trained in many branches
of science and engineering. If you are
looking for opportunities in this field,
you won't have to look far at DuPont,
where nearly half the entire technical
force is assigned to production su
pervision.
To qualify, a man must have the
ability to understand both the me
chanical and chemical phases of pro
duction. In addition, he should be a
good planner and, above all, have a
knack fc: handling people.
The production supervisor—there
nre several levels at Du Pont- has

three important areas of response
bility. The first is to the men work
ing for him. He must be able to ap
praise them skillfully and assign
duties accordingly. He must train
them not only in the efficient opera
tion of equipment but in safe work
ing practices as well.
A second responsibility is to the
customer. He must get the product
out on time and provide uniformly
high quality at the lowest possible
cost. When demand for a product is
subject to rapid fluctuations, he must
be prepared to make quick readjust
ments in the scheduling <?f both man
power and materials.

The supervisor's third responsibil
ity is to the higher management.
Here, again, quality and cost are
important factors. He is expected
to prepare forecasts, to justify un
usual expenditures, and to suggest
process improvements leading to
greater yield and better quality at
lower costs.
One of the toughest nuts a pro
duction supervisor has to crack is the
scheduling of preventive mainte
nance for minimum interference with
production. In some companies where
products are turned out in small-unit
operations, a program of breakdown
maintenance suffices. At Du Pont,
however, where large-unit operations
are the rule, unscheduled downtime
is costly and something to be avoided
whenever possible.
Since it makes over 1200 products
and product lines, Du Pont can offer
to men interested in production su
pervision opportunities in many
types of operations. In the next issue
of the Digest, we will describe a spe
cific production operation in one of
our 71 plants.

H. D. Tollman, B. S. in Industrial Administration, Yale '37, checks on product
loading methods in Du Pont's Belle, West Va., synthetic urea plant.


William Chelgren, B.S. in M.E., Armour
Institute of Technology '38, explains quality
control methods to a group of Du Pont pro
duction supervisors.
Keeping production rolling in a mod
ern industrial plant is a job that ap
peals to men trained in many branches
of science and engineering. If you are
looking for opportunities in this field,
you won't have to look far at DuPont,
where nearly half the entire technical
force is assigned to production su
pervision.
To qualify, a man must have the
ability to understand both the me
chanical and chemical phases of pro
duction. In addition, he should be a
good planner and, above all, have a
knack fc: handling people.
The production supervisor—there
nre several levels at Du Pont- has

three important areas of response
bility. The first is to the men work
ing for him. He must be able to ap
praise them skillfully and assign
duties accordingly. He must train
them not only in the efficient opera
tion of equipment but in safe work
ing practices as well.
A second responsibility is to the
customer. He must get the product
out on time and provide uniformly
high quality at the lowest possible
cost. When demand for a product is
subject to rapid fluctuations, he must
be prepared to make quick readjust
ments in the scheduling <?f both man
power and materials.

The supervisor's third responsibil
ity is to the higher management.
Here, again, quality and cost are
important factors. He is expected
to prepare forecasts, to justify un
usual expenditures, and to suggest
process improvements leading to
greater yield and better quality at
lower costs.
One of the toughest nuts a pro
duction supervisor has to crack is the
scheduling of preventive mainte
nance for minimum interference with
production. In some companies where
products are turned out in small-unit
operations, a program of breakdown
maintenance suffices. At Du Pont,
however, where large-unit operations
are the rule, unscheduled downtime
is costly and something to be avoided
whenever possible.
Since it makes over 1200 products
and product lines, Du Pont can offer
to men interested in production su
pervision opportunities in many
types of operations. In the next issue
of the Digest, we will describe a spe
cific production operation in one of
our 71 plants.
