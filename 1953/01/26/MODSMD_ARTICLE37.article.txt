## Cage Future Brighter Than Present 
### 
Stanford's basketballing five is on its way to one of the worst cage
seasons in the history of the Farm, holding three wins and 15 losses.
But if we were to lay blame anywhere it would have to fall in scattered
quantities and on scattered individuals for scattered mistakes, errors, and
faults. No one is to be entirely blamed.
When Bob Burnett started this year he had lost three of last year's
top men, all starters, Ed Tucker, Jim Ramstead and Jim Walsh. He built
with only Ron Tomsic and Oleg Suzdaleff as foundations.
Don Carlson, Wayne Culberson, Don DeLong, Tom Green, Dave Epper
son, Russ Lawler, A 1 Talboy, Sam Morley, and George Zaninovich were all
alternated in the practice games. But no winning combination could be
found and it wasn't until the California game of Jan 10 that a Stanford
five jelled and the Indians could peace together a winning combination.
And since then they have been unable to win.
And the remainder of the schedule which only has the Cards playing
twice again in the Pavilion is a tough one and not one which makes us
think the Cards can win many more. Such teams as St. Mary's, Santa
Clara, Bradley, as well as UCLA, USC, and Cal make it in fact an
awesome agenda and only the Alumni game of Feb. 3 looks like it might
be a good bet.
So with the Indians well on their way to the poorest season since 1946
when Everett Dean was only able to win 6 after a four year war layoff,
the best possible thing to do is to look ahead.
And the future looks bright. Of all 18 men who make up this year's
varsity only two won't be back next year. They are George Zaninovich
and Paul Johnson. Zaninovich is as rough ai}d tough on the boards as they
come and though he is not a polished ball player his loss will be felt. And
Johnson is a boy who gets as hot as a pistol when on, but he has been
hampered by a bad ankle and has not seen much action.
So Mr. Burnett will have back all of his first string with the exception
of Zaninovich and all the boys from the lower ranks minus Johnson.
Couple this to the fact that the other teams in the Conference will cer
tainly be no stronger than this year and the fact that the Indians have made
real battles out of all Conference losses and we get the impression that the
Indians will be a team to be reckoned with when next year's cage season
gets going.
Lawler has shown himself to be fast in improving and an excellent
offensive and defensive center. Tomsic has a fine eye but shoots too much
and his 19 point average does not tell the whole story as his percentage
of shots made in shots attempted is not all it could be. Carlson is at last
hustling and is looking like he is playing because he wants to, DeLong is
a fine player and Suzdaleff is the top all-round man on the court.
Take those five as a nucleus and it looks like a good cage future. We
are hesitant to look much past the varsity and JVs in searching for material.
Dick Clegg has done a fine job with his frosh but we can't see where there
is one man out there capable of moving in and playing varsity next year.
George Selleck is good, a fine passer, good shooter and too sure of himself,
some of which will be knocked out of him on his way up. He and Ron
Wagner are the two prospects, but they are both the short men. Both will
see eventual varsity action but not in the near future, a future which has
Burnett looking eagerly ahead, but not overlooking the present need of
winning a few more ball games.
