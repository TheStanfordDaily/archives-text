### DICK MALTZMAN 
Stanford's rugged grunt-and
groaners finally found their form
Friday night and tore the Alameda
Wildcats apart, 2G to 6, for their
first win of the season.
Even hampered by the loss of
Phil Wilson, sterling heavyweight
with some shy units, the Cards
looked every bit the champions.
Stealing the show from the
bigger boy, Ollie Lyons, the ''lit
tle tiger," wrestling his last var
sity match for the season and pos
sibly bis life, gave Don Foulks
a match he'll never forget and
pinned him in 2:40 of the first
period in the 130-pound division.
Lyons, suffering from a bad
shoulder, was out almost all last
year. This year he is undefeated in
four dual meet starts, and looked
definitely like the next PCC cham
pion. But his shoulder has been
getting worse, and Ollie made the
decision to quit the game â€” after
one more match. Ollie definitely
stole the show in his last perform
ance.
At 137, George Russell contin
ued (he spectacular form that
took him to the I'CC champion
ship in his weight class last year.
His victim was Ilerb Zimha by a
pin in 1:40 of (he first period.
At 148. Bruce Bailey, the "bat
tling barrister," pu;hed Roy Cum
mings around the mat to win a 4-0
decision.
At 157, Ken James battled How
ard Boey of Alameda to a standstill
for two and a half periods, only to
lose out in a close decision, 7-6, in
the last seconds of the third period.
The match went at a furious pace,
with the score tied 5-5 at the end
of the second period. James got one
point on a pushout and held a 6-5
advantage until the closing minute,
when Boey got a two-point take
down to take the match.
Bob Beatie, a sensational sopho
more up from the mural ranks,
took a unanimous 6-0 decision over
Bob Ferrell at 167.
At 177, Pat Madden showed a
little of his old form to pin Sal
Bevin in 2:50 of the first period.
In the heavyweight division, A 1
Colton put on one of the finest
performances of (he evening
against Ray Brown in holding
him to a decision.
