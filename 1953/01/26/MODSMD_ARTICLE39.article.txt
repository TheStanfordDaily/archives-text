worried about these games. "I
am looking ahead to the game
against the St. Mary's frosh," he
said last week. The Papooses will
meet St. Mary's, which has com
piled an undefeated record
against tough JC competition,
this Saturday at the Pavilion.

Papoose scoring for two quarters,
but in the third quarter the Cou

gathered only three markers. The
Cougars were never able to cut
down the margin during the rest
of the contest.
Contfordia did win the individual
scoring honors as forward Dave
Fazhole scored 26 poitns. Selleck,
displaying a deadly one-hand set
shot, was high from the home team
with 20 points. Gustafson, given his

first starting assignment .showed up
vffy well, scoring 15 points.

set a fast-scoring pace, racking up over 70 points in both contests.

lost but one game in 15 tests, was

meet St. Mary's, which has com
piled an undefeated record
against tough JC competition,
this Saturday at the Pavilion.
