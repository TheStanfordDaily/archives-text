# Braves Notch Eighth Win
## 
### 
Stanford's Braves waltzed to
their eighth victory of the year
Saturday afternoon with a 95-49
win over a hapless Monterey Pe
ninsula College quintet.
Tonight's scheduled game with
Menlo College has been postponed,
Coach George Lynn announced fol
lowing Saturday's slaughter.
Both teams got off to a cold
start, unable to find the range for
the first few minutes of the open
ing quarter. Stanford held a com
fortable 16-6 margin after the
first 10 minutes of play.
Monterey's Loboe made their
only bid of the game, drawing up
to 16-12, early in the second stanza,
but Lynn's stalwarts were not to be
denied. They turned on the steam
and upped their margin to 44-20
at the intermission.
The flood of buckets continued
as the junior varsity went ahead,
72-29, going into the final quar
ter.
All five Stanford starters bettered
15 points. Wayne Culberson was
high with 19. Jim Westphal, Howie
Schwartz, and Wayne Lockhart
each followed with 18, and Jim
Johnson collected 16.
Hayward High School will be
the JV's next opponent next Sat
urday.
