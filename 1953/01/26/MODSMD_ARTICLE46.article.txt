# Inside Stanford—--Toy on's Busy Switchboard
## 
### 

DA 3-3121—The busiest place on campus on Saturday nights is located in a small room in Toyon
Hall. From 7 to 9 p.m. hundreds of calls flood the telephone switchboard that serves Encina,
Branner, Toyon, Stern, and Crothers Halls. So many calls are received that Mrs. Ann Gastman,
shown above, must have two other people to assist her. The
I switchboard has 12 trunk lines leading into it but residents must
use a pay phone to call anywhere but the five halls.


COFFEE, ANYONE?—Mrs. Dorothy C. Loofbourow, Director of
Toyon Hall, pours coffee for visitors in her tiny apartment
kitchenette. Affectionately referring to Toyon residents as "my
boys," Mrs. Loofbourow tries to let the men choose their own
roommates. Most of the club members are housed in Toyon,
along with a few independents and freshmen. The University
has announced that the hall will be turned over entirely to club
members and independents, with freshmen living only at Encina
and the Village.—Daily photos by ]. A. Byrne
