# Ship Tears Power Lines, Causes Peninsula Blackout
## 
### 
Ripping the 100,000 - volt main
power lines at the mouth of Red
wood City's harbor channel, one of
the largest ships ever to enter the
port caused a general power black
out throughout the Peninsula on
Saturday from 8:4!) to a.m. The
ship's 135-foot mast tore the lines
down into the water.
There was no damage and nu
one was injured aboard the 492-
foot S.S. (ieorge Luckenhach. Pa
cific (Â«as and Electric Co. service
men said "it was almost a miracle
that no one was burned or
shocked."

Emergency power was restored
from South Sari Franciveo ti Palo
Alto a half-hour after the mishap
occurred. Four momentary black
outs were reported a.s workmen
shifted power on th( emergency
lines.
Entering the port yesterday, the
Luckenbach i;hip is .cheduleri to
leave Monday from Redwood City's
harbor Where she picked up a cargo
of magnesite for delivery to Rotter
dam.
II is expected that the cargo will
weigh the ship low enough into
the water to allow for clearance
of the repaired wires.
Said Redwood City's port man
ager. Merritt I). IMcCarl, the inci
dent again points to the need for
expansion and reorganization of
the port facilities commensurate
with the need of marine activities
that are finding their way here."
