# Deferments Criticized

### 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 25
(UP) â€”Retiring Harvard Univer
sity President James Bryant Co
nant Unight attacked draft de
ferments for college boys as
causing "growing popular re
sentment."
Conant called again for universal
military training in his final report
as Harvard's President. He resigned
to become U.S. High Commissioner
to Germany.
Conant said despite efforts of
himself and various other college
presidents who wanted UMT, se
lective service issued regulations
"designed to keep the colleges full
of students."
He said the regulations "accom
plished their immediate purpose but
at the price of a growing popular re
sentment."
Conant continued, "To be sure,
many college graduates arc serving
in the armed forces; I have had to
write once again sad letters to the
families of recent alumni who have
fallen in battle. But by and large it
has been the boy who was notable to
go to college whose family has had
to mourn. It is obvious that such a
policy docs not take for national
unity."
Reviewing the triumphs and fail
ure:; of his 10-year administration at
Harvard, Conant mentioned the draft
as he discussed the problems faced
by his still unchosen successor.
"I am inclined," Conant said, "to
think the proponents of the ridi
culous charge that our colleges are
subversive receive a wider hearing
today than at any time in recent
history."
Among the reasons for the in
creased attention to the charges he
said is "public suspicion of colleges"
resulting in part from athletics "so
competitive as to generate public
scandals" and from"the special posi
tion colleges occupy under selective
service."
