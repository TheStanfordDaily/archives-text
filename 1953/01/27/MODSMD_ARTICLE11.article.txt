ON THE DOTTED LINE—New pledges cheerfully sign pledge
cards indicating their choice of fraternity. This is the scene
enacted 384 times in the Nitery last night as the largest pledge
class in the history of Stanford went through the formalities.

Average "take" per Row house was 16, with Theta Xi and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon tied for the top number with 23 new pledges
each. The smallest class this year numbered five pledges.
