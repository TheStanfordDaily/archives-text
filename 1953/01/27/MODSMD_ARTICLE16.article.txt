# Blauth: Faust and Fun
## 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
Are Goethe's "Faust" and the rollicking German Club incom
patible enthusiasms?
Not in the opinion of Herr Henry Blauth, popular Stanford pro
fessor of German and Germanic literature.
"Social life and contact are as important a part of education as

the academic side," he declares.
Practicing what he preaches,
Blauth displays a lively interest in
extra - curricular activities, espe
cially his German Club, as well as
in his courses.
The German Club, which tncels
once or twice a quarter, had its
beginnings hack in 1946, when
Hlauth was a counselor at Toyon
Hall.
In that year, the hall was mainly
occupied by war veterans who had
served in Germany and other Eu
ropean countries.
"About a half-dozen came to
me and suggested that we get to
gether some Friday night to sing
songs and talk about Germany,"
the short, cheerful professor re
calls. "The meetings proved so
popular that we derided to open
them to the entire student body."
Aside from the club, Blauth's
main interest is his course on
"Faust," which he says is definitely
his favorite subject.
"I try to give the students back
ground on Goethe, and to give the
literature life," he declares. "And,
in order to give a subject life, the
teacher must believe in and like
what he teaches."
In teaching "Faust," which is
on tlu> agenda for spring quarter,
Itlnuth covers Goethe's whole

life, and examines the author's
views on religion, science, and
universities, all of which appear in
"Faust."
In discussing the course. Blauth
Says,"I do not aim just to dish out
memorizable information which can
be played back to me at tests. I
want to holi) students to find out

their own reactions to the problems
presented."
Though he has been in America
•since 1P39, Blauth confesses with
comic despair thai our game of
football still puzzles him, since he
finds it so much more difficult
than the European soccer.
"I always lose the man with the
ball." he admits, gesturing expres
sively, "and so get. horribly con
futed. Generally the only way I
know what's happening is to follow
the rooting section."
Blauth, who had taught for two
years at Harvard before coming
to Stanford in 194(5, had some in
teresting comparisons between
the two universities.
"In ,a coeducational school, such
as Stanford, the class discussion is
not so one-sided. Wc can get both
viewpoints in a course with men
and women students."
The profevs'or claimed (hat, due
to the physical isolation of the
Stanford campus, students are
not so much of life around
them as arc the Harvard stu
dents, who live only eight min
ufes from the heart of Boston.
"However," he added, "living so
close together makes the Stanford
students more of a real family."
Blauth approves of the uniform
ity of style of the Stanford Quad,
compared to Harvard's "moldy me
dieval castles set next to supcr
niodern buildings."
"All in all," he concluded, "I may
safely say that my years at Stan
ford have been among the most en
joyable in my entire teaching ca
reer."
