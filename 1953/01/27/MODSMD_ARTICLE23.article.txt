# Houses Claim Largest Class in History---384
## 
### HADLEY ROFF 
Three hundred eighty - four
students signed pledge cards
last night, the largest pledge
class in Stanford's fraternity
history.
This year's record - shattering
class topped by five last year's giant
group of 379.
The size of the average fraternity
pledge class was 16. Housea claim
ing the largest pledge classes were
Theta Xi and SAE with 23 apiece.
The pledge card signing took
place in the Nitery, a usually calm
campus room that last night took
on the appearance of a six - ring
circus.
It all began at 7:30, when frater
nities, after gala banquets at the
individual houses, escorted pledges
to the Nitery. The exciting parade
continued until well past 8.
During the signing, the confu
sion was glorious.
It was like a Rotary, Lions, and
Elks convention rolled into one
joy-filled package.
There was back-slapping, hand
clasping, and smiles that made Pep
sodent ads look pale.
There were shouts of joy, and
loud laughing and singing that
soared high.
And out of the wonderful be
wilderment came the startling
fact that Stanford's 24 Greek-let
tered houses had combined to
pledge the largest class in the
University's history.
That the event wa3 exciting could
be attested to by any of the flushed,
happy pledges. Alex Lee, Delta Up
silon pledge, said: "It's great, sim
ply great."
Johnny Wiester, Delta Upsllon
pledge: "The greatest experence
of my life."
Spike Lynch, Alpha Delta Phi
pledge: "Feels just fineâ€”no
kidding."
Lew Mottley, Kappa Alpha
pledge: "It's very exciting."
And on and on.
Most Row rushing chairmen
agreed that this year's pledge class
was more serious and studious than
that of last year. One Row chair
man, a senior, said the current class
is the strongest "I have seen during
my four years at Stanford."
Rushing chairmen, during the
hectic round of open houses two
weeks ago, remarked about the
cautious attitude of freshmen to
ward rushing.
