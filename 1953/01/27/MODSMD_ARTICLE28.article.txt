# A 						Rushing Suggestion
## 
### 
Rushing—for the most part, it's over!!
In a way we breathe a sigh of relief. The in
tense attempts at acquaintanceship; the hectic
round of parties and more parties, meals and
more meals and the countless after-dinner stag
calls; the incessant housemeetings; and the
mixture of bewilderment and thoughtfullness
on a rushee's face as he ponders whether or not
to take a pin.
However, in another way, we enjoyed it. The
parties were fun; it was interesting to meet the
class of freshmen; there was an outlet of sorts
for the budding politicians; and by and large
the houses and rushees will find in the long
run they have made the right decisions.
Fraternity rushing has been undergoing mo
dification ever since the houses first came to
Stanford. The last major change came about
three years back when Xmas rushing parties
were reintroduced. Today the system is pretty
well worked out.
But that doesn't mean we should sit back and
regard it as the ultimate wonder of the world.
If attempts are not made regularly to maintain
or improve the system, it won't stay put. Viola
tions of rushing rules will change from rumors
to facts. Feeling will change from harmonious
to bitter. Such a result would seriously damage
the fraternity system at Stanford. Not good, eh?

With the actual press of 1953 activities over,
we'd like to offer a suggestion for possible fu
ture improvement of the rushing system.
Since Eating Club rushing is a pretty informal
matter, and by the very nature of the Clubs we
think it should stay that way, what we have
to say concerns IFC and the fraternities.
Specifically, the suggestion is for the'IFC to
investigate the possible advantages of some
form of sealed bidding.
Sealed bidding is something Stanford fra
ternities have never tried, nor have ever known
much about. But it is practiced with varying
degrees of success on many other campi. Ore
gon is one school on the Coast with a sealed
bid system.
We are told the administration is sympathe
tic to the idea. Consequently, if IFC were to
investigate the pros, cons, and methods of a
Stanford sealed bidding system, and come up
with a program, we believe that the University
would co-operate fully m establishing it.
The arguments for and against such a system
are many, but there is a good chance it would
eliminate much of the remnant of "hptboxing
and snowballing" that still goes on.
Think it over, IFC, it might prove worth
while.—Jim Madison
