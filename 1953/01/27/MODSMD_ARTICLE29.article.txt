## From Another Viewpoint 
### HARRY J. RATHBUN 
(Editor's note: Below, Law School Professor Harry
J. Rathbun, noted for his undergraduate courses
in Business Law, presents some of his views on the
"Aims of Higher Education." Professor Rathbun
will elaborate these views and discuss the subjects
of personal adjustment and achievement in a series
of seminars for students beginning next week. The
Sequoia Seminars will be held on three consecutive
Sundays, the first on Feb. 1, at the South Palo Alto
Library.)

Inventory-taking at appropriate intervals is a prac
tice essential to the health of most enterprises. The
educational enterprise is no exception. An occasional
taking of stock, the attempt to evaluate progress,
would appear important both for him whose educa
tion i.s in process and for those whose job is to help
him with his task. The last decade has seen many
significant efforts to study and evaluate our educa
tional procedures, one of the better known of which
i ( inbodied in the Harvard Report of 1945.
Before taking any inventory of progres. however,
perhaps we ought to clarify and define the foal we

seek. It i.s pretty difficult to meas- g
ure progress without knowing V
where one is trying to go. Some
or. has said it in picturesque
language: "All roads lead to your
goal if you don't care where you
are going."
Since the purpose of education
is to produce educated people, the
appropriate first question would
seem to be: "What is an educated
person?"

Personally I should define terms oi nve oasic
achievements. Of course these are not separate and
distinct from one another but are closely interrelated.
Looking at them one by one, however, may help us
to see how they are related to one another and to
the goal.
1. At the base I should place competence in hand
ling the intellectual tools necessary for successful
communication and relationship with one's fellow men.
That is a very broad area. It encompasses most of what
we think of as the subject matter of our educational ef
fort; At its primary level it includes the "Three R's";

at higher levels it includes most of the subject matter
of a university's courses, including those in the pro
fessions. In between falls the whole field of training
to make a living, to which some would deny the dig
nity of the word "education."
2. I feel that a truly educated person possesses a
quality which is at once both a causative factor in
making him educated (and therefore in keeping the
process going as long as he lives) and also a product
of the process. This quality is intellectual curiosity.
I would not attempt to say whether this quality is born
in a person or is somehow supplied by the successful
educational process. One thing I can say with some
confidence. It Ls that I have seen this quality brought
to life in students through their encounter with great
teachers, men and women whose enthusiasm for and
command of their respective disciplines somehow
-evoked a kindred enthusiasm in their students.
3. Intellectual integrity seems to me an essential in
gredient of the truly educated man. This is the rigor
ous dedication to truth which is the greatest protection
against error. It seems unnecessary to labor the point.
4. I believe the genuinely educated person has a
clear perception as to what things are of the greatest
importance to the human enterprise, and an under
standing of their relationship to it. This obviously
takes us into the realm of value. Here criteria are
sought, discovered, and established for making tlte
choices which relate directly to man's proper function
ing. It involves the problem of goals and of relevancy.
Any adequate discussion of this proposition would
take far more space than is available here.
5. It is my conviction that if the educational pro
cess were completely to fulfill its function, it would
produce psychologically mature human beings. Space
does not permit an attempt to set down the specifica
tions for a mature person; perhaps the term itself suf
ficiently suggests its propriety as the prime goal of
education. If we could achieve this goal, the other
four would present no problem.
In all this I have said nothing about how these ends
are to be attained. To do that adequately would re
quire a book. Here I shall simply declare my faith
that they are possible of achievement, that in his long
history man has already discovered enough to enable
him to know how to do this kind of job whenever he
himself becomes mature enough to want, above all
else, to do it for those he seeks to educate.

of a university's courses, including those in the pro

2. I feel that a truly educated person possesses a
quality which is at once both a causative factor in
making him educated (and therefore in keeping the
process going as long as he lives) and also a product
of the process. This quality is intellectual curiosity.
I would not attempt to say whether this quality is born
in a person or is somehow supplied by the successful
educational process. One thing I can say with some
confidence. It Ls that I have seen this quality brought
to life in students through their encounter with great
teachers, men and women whose enthusiasm for and
command of their respective disciplines somehow
-evoked a kindred enthusiasm in their students.
3. Intellectual integrity seems to me an essential in
gredient of the truly educated man. This is the rigor
ous dedication to truth which is the greatest protection
against error. It seems unnecessary to labor the point.
4. I believe the genuinely educated person has a
clear perception as to what things are of the greatest
importance to the human enterprise, and an under
standing of their relationship to it. This obviously
takes us into the realm of value. Here criteria are
sought, discovered, and established for making tlte
choices which relate directly to man's proper function
ing. It involves the problem of goals and of relevancy.
Any adequate discussion of this proposition would
take far more space than is available here.
5. It is my conviction that if the educational pro
cess were completely to fulfill its function, it would
produce psychologically mature human beings. Space
does not permit an attempt to set down the specifica
tions for a mature person; perhaps the term itself suf
ficiently suggests its propriety as the prime goal of
education. If we could achieve this goal, the other
four would present no problem.
In all this I have said nothing about how these ends
are to be attained. To do that adequately would re
quire a book. Here I shall simply declare my faith
that they are possible of achievement, that in his long
history man has already discovered enough to enable
him to know how to do this kind of job whenever he
himself becomes mature enough to want, above all
else, to do it for those he seeks to educate.

Inventory-taking at appropriate intervals is a prac
