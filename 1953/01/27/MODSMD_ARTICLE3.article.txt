### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 (UP)—The United States will launch a
new series of atomic tests in Nevada next March, including the
biggest "live" troop maneuvers yet and possibly the first firing
of the new atomic cannon, the Atomic Energy Commission has
announced.
The Commission also disclosed that a new $29 million factory

will be built on the Spoon River in
Fulton County, 111., to process and
assemble the explosive cores of
atomic weapons.
It was the, first word of the new
atom factory, designed to „step up
the supply of the nation's steadily
growing atomic arsenal.
Announcement of the; new tests
at bleak Frenchman's Flat in Ne
vada did not mention the atomic
cannon. But there has been specu
lation the huge 11-inch gun, which
awed crowds and tele\ncwers of the
Eisenhower inaugural parade last
week, will be fired for the first time
in' the spring tests; - r 1
Authoritative sources said the
tests will not involve the hydrogen
bomb.
