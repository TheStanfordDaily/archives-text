# CAMPUS OPINION
## 'No Place to Hide' 
### 
To the Editor: .
There comes a time when even the meekest of men
must cry out in protest. Such a time seems to have
arrived.
Sunday, a day elsewhere dedicated to peace, quiet,
and solemn meditation, has become a day of infernal
bedlam on the Farm. Starting at 10:30 and continuing
throughout the day at frequent intervals and with
maddening regularity, the cacophony of the Hoover
Bells penetrate the innermost recesses of the campus.
Unlike television and radio, it cannot be silenced by
turning a knob. To the contrary and in true spirit of
the atomic age, there is no place to hide.
On Sunday the student body can roughly be
divided into three main groups. The first consists of
those who have celebrated too streneously the night
before. Their poor heads throb enough without
these added vibrations. Next there are those who
find that all their work cannot he completed during

the week and depend on Sunday as a time for con
centration on their studies. Finally there are the
lucky ones, off to the city or the ski slopes and con
sequently not exposed to this medieval torture.
For the benefit of the first two groups we should
venture a modest suggestion. If the administration
feels that their beloved bells must be played, they
should spread out the chaos instead of concentrating
it all in one day. A five-minute session at noon each
day might be bearable.
Appropriately enough, these chimes are housed in
an edifice dedicated to the study of war, revolution
and peace. It is our contention that if this Sunday
war does not change to a Sunday peace, the revolu
tion is inevitable!
