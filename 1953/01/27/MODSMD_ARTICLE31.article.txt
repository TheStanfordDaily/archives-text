# BULL SESSION
## 
### BOB STETSON 
I wish to congratulate you all. You were able to ex
ist for the last two weeks without my column. It is
truly remarkable that so many were able to stand up
under the ordeal. It must have been just like taking
dope from an addict. You made it, however.
While my parents were sleeping blissfully 800 miles

anyway I gained fc4,000 brothers.
Shake on that. That is rushing.
This hand shaking business is
no small matter. I met one char
acter that will back me up on this.
After rushing last year he had his
arm in a sliftg for six weeks when
he separated six tendons in his
right forearm from so much shak
ing of hands.
Personally, my voice was en
dangered from answering people

who would ask, "Are you the guy who writes those
things in the paper?" I managed to bear up under
the strain pretty well, however.

Last Monday the Civ lecturer was caught rather
unprepared when one of his rhetorical questions was
answered by derisive comments from a Collie in the
balcony.
I thought perhaps that would be a good introduc
tion for my discussion on prostitution in San Fran
cisco. But the more I think about it, the less I believe
it would, so I shall move on to a more interesting
topic, viz., hate.
It was once said that love and hate are but two
sides of the same coin, i.e. the dividing line between
love and hate is very slight. So to make someone
love you, first provoke them to hatred of your person.
This is the key. Take it from me. Everyone now

hates me, but my day is coming. Abomination will
turn to violent, uncontrollable affection. Obviouslj
hate is the basic reality of a happy life. Hate, hate,
hate.

Death is the spice of life.

So- far I have discussed rushing, broken arms, lies
hate, and death. Am I morbid, fiendish, sadistic, neu
rotic, psychotic, masochistic? No. I simply strive t<
provide entertainment and amusement for my hordes
of admirers.
Besides, what could be more appropriate subjects
for early-morning reading? The only thing that coulc
possibly be more apropos is sleep. So I shall tell yoi
all about .sleep.
The average college student has spent seven year:
in bed. It is simple to deduce from this fact that sleej
is popular. It is the thing to do. (I'm sorry but my
roommate is throwing a knife at the lewd pictures or:
the wall in back of me and I don't want to die until
I finish this column. Excuse me while I move.)
(He struck success.) So I can now continue. Sleep
is very popular all over the world. Get on the sleep
bandwagon. It relaxes you without making you
sleepy. It makes you want to stop smoking. And
drinking. Sleep is one of the greatest things the ever
happened. Everyone's doing it. Besides, it's fun!
So go to sleep.

My package, my package,
My little yellowed page;
I beg you, I beseech you
Give me not unto the light,
But deliver me therurito.
