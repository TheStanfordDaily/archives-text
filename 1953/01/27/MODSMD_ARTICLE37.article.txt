# Traditions and Trials Mark Fraternity and Club Histories
## SINCE 1901 Weary Roughs Initiate Clubs 
### WALT WILLIAMS 
Twenty Stanford men, tired
of fighting' the crowds at the
old Stanford Inn, and tired of
walking into Paly every night
lor dinner, banded together in
1901 to form the Farm's first eat
ing club.
These 20 men decided to hire a
cook ;md eat together as a group
' "Mey called themselves Los Arcos
Eating Club.
During the next 15 years, several
other eating groups were organ
ized on the campus, and by World
War I the seven clubs active today
had been formed. Three clubs —
Toro, Breakers, and Campo, built
Ub rooms on the present site of
the Encina parking lot.' Alumni still
refer to this building as the "Little
Quad."
When Encina Commons was
luiilt about five years later, rooms
were leased to the other four
clubs — Arcos, Cuadro, Capitan,
iiiil Tigre.
During World War II the clubs
disbanded. The "Little Quad" was
razed, and the dining rooms for
merly used by the other four clubs
were taken over by Encina fresh
men. }
With the end of the war, the
ilubs were reorganized, and all
seven moved back into Encina

Commons dining rooms. Dissatis
fied with this setup, clubmen and
alumni began making plans for a
new building which would pro
vide complete dining room, kitch
en, and lounge facilities for each
of the clubs.
With Bill McPherson, former El
Campo member and Inter-Club
president, as building committee
chairman, plans for the present
club building were drawn up. As
financial problems 'arose, Univer
sity officials pledged their support,
and work was begun on the new
building on Argyello Street next to
Toyon.

Clubmen moved into their new
quarters in September, 1951, and
the new club rooms were dedi
cated two months later, on Big
Game Day.
The new building provides each
club with a dining room accommo
dating up to 50 members and also a
modern kitchen, storage space, and
cook's living quarters.
There is also a central lounge
shared by all of the seven clubs,
which was thrown open to inspec
tion for the all-campus dance held
during homecoming weekend last
quarter.
