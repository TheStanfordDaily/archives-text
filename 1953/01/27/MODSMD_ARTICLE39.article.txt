# FROM ANOTHER CAMPUS
## 'Twas the Morning After The Rush Week Before 
### BOB FUNK 
(Editor's note: The following
column, "A Day at the Zoo," ap
peared last fall in the University
of Oregon's Daily Emerald. We
liked it and thought you might,
too.)
It was the morning after rush
week. No one was up. No one
intended to get up. Ever. The
living room was littered with
pamphlets entitled "Our House
Is the Neatest House Ever and
the lota Omicrons Smoke Mari
juana."
The dog was lying quietly on the
floor, gnawing on a left-over rush
ee. A vulture cawed (or whatever
sound vultures make. Tweet, may
be) softly from a rafter.
Upstairs the house president
was just going to bed. He had
been up all night trying to figure
out how to make out a preference
list. Finally he had sent a note to
student affairs saying simply, "We
withdraw from rush week. It
stinks."
The rushing chairman was lying
in a pool of blood in the middle of
the hall. There were, footprints
across him where people had
walked. A pledge passed. "I think
the rushing chairman would look
more effective as a front door mat,"
he thought to himself. (To sensi
tive readers: do not worry, the

blood does not belong to the rush
ing chairman. It belongs to some
one who said, on Friday, "When
docs rush week start?" That is an
other, rather morbid story.)
Several members finally got up
and started packing. One was
going to join a monastery, or
maybe a nunnery. One was go
ing back to Grant High School.
The others were just going. They
went downstairs (we have al
ready described what the down
stairs looked like. By this time
it was even worse, somehow).
There was a gaping hole in the
wall where someone had shot a
large something millimeter shell
through the charter.
They stood in the middle of the
room and sang one last fraternity
song. Everyone half - heartedly
whispered the password. It was
over then, over and done with.
"It's over and done with," they
said. The truth of this statement
rankled bitterly in their hearts.
Or maybe their stomachs. They
hadn't had breakfast. Each man
kicked the fraternity dog, and
then they filed slowly out the
door.
There was no sound but that of
the wind howling through the hole
where the charter had been, and
the dog chewing on the rushee. A
newspaper blew across the littered
floor. Its large black headline said,
"Rush Week Is Over."
(Columnist's note: yippee!)

the lota Omicrons Smoke Mari
juana."
The dog was lying quietly on the
floor, gnawing on a left-over rush
ee. A vulture cawed (or whatever
sound vultures make. Tweet, may
be) softly from a rafter.
Upstairs the house president
was just going to bed. He had
been up all night trying to figure
out how to make out a preference
list. Finally he had sent a note to
student affairs saying simply, "We
withdraw from rush week. It
stinks."
The rushing chairman was lying
in a pool of blood in the middle of
the hall. There were, footprints
across him where people had
walked. A pledge passed. "I think
the rushing chairman would look
more effective as a front door mat,"
he thought to himself. (To sensi
tive readers: do not worry, the

blood does not belong to the rush
ing chairman. It belongs to some
one who said, on Friday, "When
docs rush week start?" That is an
other, rather morbid story.)
Several members finally got up
and started packing. One was
going to join a monastery, or
maybe a nunnery. One was go
ing back to Grant High School.
The others were just going. They
went downstairs (we have al
ready described what the down
stairs looked like. By this time
it was even worse, somehow).
There was a gaping hole in the
wall where someone had shot a
large something millimeter shell
through the charter.
They stood in the middle of the
room and sang one last fraternity
song. Everyone half - heartedly
whispered the password. It was
over then, over and done with.
"It's over and done with," they
said. The truth of this statement
rankled bitterly in their hearts.
Or maybe their stomachs. They
hadn't had breakfast. Each man
kicked the fraternity dog, and
then they filed slowly out the
door.
There was no sound but that of
the wind howling through the hole
where the charter had been, and
the dog chewing on the rushee. A
newspaper blew across the littered
floor. Its large black headline said,
"Rush Week Is Over."
(Columnist's note: yippee!)
(Editor's note: The following
column, "A Day at the Zoo," ap
peared last fall in the University
of Oregon's Daily Emerald. We
liked it and thought you might,
too.)
It was the morning after rush
week. No one was up. No one
intended to get up. Ever. The
living room was littered with
pamphlets entitled "Our House
Is the Neatest House Ever and
the lota Omicrons Smoke Mari
juana."
