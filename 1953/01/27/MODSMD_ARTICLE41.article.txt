# AS OLD AS STANFORD
## Six Original Fraternities Begin Greek-Letter Chain Reaction 
### HADLEY ROFF 
Fraternities, their grand traditions sweeping back into Ameri
can history, have been an integral part of Stanford life since 1891,
the year the University was founded.
The last sandstone blocks had hardly been laid along Quad
before Stanford roughs began organizing houses and applying

for membership in national frater
nities.
And the nationals, expressing
confidence in Stanford and her stu
dents, responded quickly: within
the first year the campus boasted
tix houses. Those houses are still
active in the University's social,
athletic, and scholastic whirl.
The six initiated a chain reac
tion which has expanded to to
day's fraternity system boasting
24 active houses representing top
national organizations and hav
ing a combined membership of
about 750 men.
Added to this are the approxi
mately 350 pledges sworn in last
night at ceremonies at the Nitery
and at individual houses.
The Greek - letter men balance
with club members and independ
ents in sharing student body re
sponsibility at Stanford. One of the
unique aspects of this University,
according to President Wallace Ster
ling and other officials, is that no
one group dominates campus ac
tivities.
Chief Counselor for Men Rich
ard L. Balch stressed that point
when he wrote for the current edi
tion of the Fraternity Handbook.
He said:
"Stanford is not a university in
which a social necessity exists for
fraternity membership. However,
living in an atmosphere of a
closely knit, democratic, small
living group can supplement to
a great degree your (the stu
dent's) University education."
According to fraternity enthusi
asts, the chief value in living in a
fraternity stems from "co-opera
tive- living." The Fraternity Hand
book, edited by Peter Whorf, Al
pha Delta Theta, hammers this
theme.
The introduction to the handbook
states:
"The system of co-operative liv
ing upon which the fraternity is
based affords the man the chance
to accept and discharge responsi
bilities through participation in
chapter activities and organization."
Such co-operative experience
was the aim of the men who
founded the first six fraternities
here, the six that kicked off the
University's Greek-letter move
ment.
The first six were: Phi Delt, Phi
Psi, SAE, Sigma Chi, Sigma Nil,
and Zeta Psi. All six, like most
fraternities at Stanford, can tracc
the history of their national back
to the first half of the nineteenth
century.
Fraternities developed early in
American history, with the Alpha
Delt fraternity appearing first, in
1832. DU organized as a non-sccret
fraternity in 1834. Beta Theta Pi
was formed in 1839.
Over half of the Stanford frater
nities can trace their history back
into the turbulent early half of the
last century.

But a lengthy history alone
doesn't make a fraternity. Some
of the latecomers in the frater
nity world, like AKL, organized
in 1920, and Alpha Sig, organized
in 1917, have rolled into campus
activities with the same vigor
and strength as the long-estab
lished houses.
Over - all fraternity activities,
such as rushing and hell week, are
supervised by the Inter-Fraternity
Council, presided over by Chuck
Denny, Delt. The council is made
up of representatives of each of the
houses.
