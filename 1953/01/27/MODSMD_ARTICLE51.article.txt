Employing a clicking fast break
ynd a lot of hustk*, Phi Delt I
soundly trounced Delts 11, 52-12,
last night in an intramural basket
ball encounter.
, Paced by Bob Mace, who ended
the evening with 20 counters, Phi
Delt rolled up a fast 31-4 half-time
lead. Tom Dandurand controlled
both boards almost exclusively.
The winners kept pouring on the
coal until the final gun. Dick Weis
mann and Vince Nola led the losers
with four apiece.
Vic Fennel and Doug Shum
way sparked I lie winners' fast
break with sterling floor play.
Fennel also hit five shots from
far out for 10 points, while
Shumway garnered six on lay
ins and tip-ins.
The Phi Delts switched to a zone
defense to start the second half, but
after the Delts got a couple of
quick baskets, they scrapped it for
man to man. Then the winners got
rolling again, with captain Gary
Gray feeding both Mace and Dan
durand for stood shots in the key.
Weismann and Nola looked the
best for the Delts. Both contributed
spurts of good ball-handling and
occasional baskets Herman Chris
tensen got most of the Delts' re
bounds.
