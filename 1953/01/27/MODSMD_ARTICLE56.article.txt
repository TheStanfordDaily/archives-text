# Indian Varsity Prepares For Stint in Cow Palace
## 
### 
Coach Bob Burnett's cagers, still
recuperating from their rather un-
Lucceisful Hawaiian tour, return to

the Cow Palace this weekend for a
pair of games.
Friday night the Cards will face
off against Santa Clara while Cali
fornia tangles with St. Mary's in the
other game of the evening. Satur
day night the teams switch oppo
nents.
The Indians, whose last ap
pearance at the Cow Palace this
season was a 95-80 loss to power
ful LaSalle, hope to fare better
against their California Basket
ball Association opponents.
Cal, idle last week because of
finals, should handle both oppo
nents without much trouble. Santa
Clara and St. Mary's will have
psychological advantage, however,
since either team's record would be
more impressive with a win over
the Southern Division leaders of

the PCC.
A win might also he nice when
the NCAA bids arc passed out.
Santa Clara, highly rated before the
season got under way, has not lived
up to expectations. %
In Saturday's 84-. r >(i win over
St. Mary's the Brunei did display
some nice form. If they wish to
he recipients of an NCAA invite,
they could move a step closer by
bouncing Cal Saturday niftht.
St. Mary's is presently holding
down second place in the CBA cage
race with a 3 and 1 record, while
Santa Clara is third, having split
four contests.
