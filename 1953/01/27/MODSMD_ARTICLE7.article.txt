# Clubs, Fraternities Pledge Huge Classes
## Clubs Add 81 Members; Rushing Will Continue 
### WALT WILLIAMS 
Stanford's seven eating clubs
have added 81 members since
the start of their '53 rushing pro
gram three weeks ago. This to
tal is 14 short of last year's rec
ord pledge class of 95, but Dick
Bennett, Inter - Club president,
emphasized last night that each
of the clubs will continue in
formal rushing to add to its ros
ter.
Breakers topped the list of
pledges with 19 new members. Bob
Margolis and Bill Gillespie are the
club's rush chairmen.
El Toro followed with a total of
16, and El Capitan pledged 15. El
Cuadro added 13 new members, El
Tigre added 8, and El Campo and
Los Arcos pledged 5 each.
The clubs' rushing program has
been rolling for three weeks since
its kick-off at open houses held in
the year-old club building during
the first week of the quarter.
Following the open houses, each
of the clubs has been hosting rush
ees at a round of parties and invi
tational meals.
Club chairmen described the re
sponse to these activities as "very
good," and Bennett last night
termed the whole program "a great
success."
He pointed out again that the
clubs use no formal pledge-card
signing procedure. A man may be
come a member at any time by
simply accepting a bid.
