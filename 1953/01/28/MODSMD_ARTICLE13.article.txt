# Milstein Is Next Artist In ASSU Concert Series
## 
### NAN CERINI 
Nathan Milstein, who will appear at Memorial Auditorium at
8:15 p.m. Saturday under the auspices of the ASSU Concert Series,
has been acknowledged by critics in three continents as one of the
world's greatest violinists.
His concert tours have included Europe, South America, and

North America, as well as Egypt,'
Palestine, and Israel. He has made
23 tours of the United States and
Canada alone.
The violin Milstein will play in his
recital here was made by the famous
Antonius Stradivarius. It is known
to connoiseurs as the"Ex-Goldmann"
but Milstein has renamed it the
"Maria Therese" in honor of his wife
Therese and his daughter Maria.
The violin was made in 171 CÂ». and
belongs to the so-called "golden
period" of Slradivarius's creative
activities. The former owners kept
it hidden from the Nazis during
World War 11. It resumed its career
on Milstein's first post-war concert
tour of Europe in 1917. '
Milstein is a Russian-born Amer
ican citizen. He always carries with
him a watch given him in Russia as
a recital fee during the Revolution.
The watch is on a gold chain which

was presented to him by a close
friend after his debut in Vienna.
Milstein considers the watch and
chain a good-luck charm.
He has a very unusual way of
remembering telephone numbers.
He thinks of the digits from one to
nine as positions on the G string
of 'his violin and thus translates
each combination of numbers into
a melody. Then lie only has to re
member the exchange and the
melody.
