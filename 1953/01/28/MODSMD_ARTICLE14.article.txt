## Minto Cites Opportunity For Church to Serve 
### TED GIESE 
"Stanford's religious problems have remained much the same
over the years. We are still confronted with the unfinished work
of making the Memorial Church an integral part of the life of the
University and the community."
The Rev. Robert M. Minto, Stanford chaplain, in his Tuesday

Evening Series talk last night orH
"Fifty Years of the Stanford" Memo
rial Church," emphasized the con
trolling idea that the church should
be the heart of the University, spir
itually as well as topographically.
This conception of the church
was present from the very first, ac
cording to Chaplain Minto. "Stan
ford is unique in being the first
university in the country in which
a large church was provided for
from the start. All other large uni
versity churches date from the
1920's or later."
Chaplain Minto noted that it was
Mrs. Stanford wlio lavished the
great personal care on the build
ing of the church. To her, spiri
tual instruction was more impor
tant for young people than any
other instruction; she believed
that there was more in church
than doctrine, and saw as the
best agent for spiritual develop
ment a non-sectarian chapel.
Reading from old documents on
the church which form a special
Stanford Library collection, Chap
lain Minto recounted what was said
at the dedication services in 1903.
The afternoon minister, Dr. Gard
ner, saw the church as a test of the
capacity of a non-sectarian church
to minister to the needs of a great
university.
The morning speaker, Dr. New
ton, remarked that "deeper minds
see in all churches a common feel

ing which knits men together in the
sacred bonds of human fellowship."
He read a passage from a Stan
ford Daily editorial published in
1914: "It doesn't matter if you
don't believe in the speaker's po
sition. The big thing in going to
the church on Sunday lies in our
hearing another point of view."
At present, Chaplain Minto as
serted, the basic aim and "future
unlimited opportunity" for the
church to serve is being carried
forth in new academic courses in
religion regularly scheduled under
the visiting Rev. Alexander Miller.
