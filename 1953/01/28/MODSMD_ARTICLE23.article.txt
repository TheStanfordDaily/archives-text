### PETE GROTHE 
HUSHING POST MORTEMS
Gene Katnik, comedian of the SAE house, was
showing a rushee around during open house. The
frosh was obviously impressed, because just before
leaving, he asked, "Say, 1 like your house. Where do
1 sign up for it?"
* * * * *
A freshman at a Zete open house informed one of
the brothers, "Your house is sure nice, but it's cer
tainly not as big as that nice-looking fraternity house
up on the hill."
"That," said the Zete, looking out of the window,
"is the Knoll."
*****
HELL WEEK FLASHBACK. In a recent hell
week episode, a pledge at one of the houses was
dumped penniless on a lonely road on Mount Diablo.
Fifty feet away was a Ford with a key in it.
"Well," thought the pledge, "those actives aren't
such bad guys after all. They left me a car with
which to go home."
The pledge climbed in the car, roared off for the
Farm, thinking nice thoughts about the sweet brothers
back in the house. In the meantime, a statewide alarm
w;;S being sounded for the Ford. Which wasn't left
by the brothers at all, but rather belonged to a Mount
Diablo resident.

ORCHIDS DEPT. We can't put this column to bed
without a big six for Dorothy Dodge, who sputters
her last as Daily editor this week. She was probably

one of the most criticized editors the Daily ever hud
by virtue of the uncomplicated fact that she is a
Democrat on a Republican campus during an election
year. And yet she did her job ably, yes brilliantly.
She handled the election issue smartly, having both
sides presented and turned in one of the best jobs of
Daily editorship we have seen.

TWO VOTES Joe, who plays linebacker on the
fpotball team, is one of the Breakers Eating Club's top
rushers. He was informed by one of the members last
week that there was one rushee who was a hot pros
pect and that he should work on him.
Joe accepted the challenge, button-holed the pros
pect, and took him outside the door. Joe went to
work with some silver-tongued oration that would
have put William Jennings Bryan to shame. He told
him about the grand tradition of the Breakers, how
they had four starters on the 1941 Rose Bowl team,
what a great bunch of guys they were, and about
the big wheels in the club. Finally, after 15 minutes
of perspiration-inducing pressure, the rushee gave
in and said that he'd join.
It was at this juncture that the president of the
club, who had gotten wind of what was happening,
came up and whispered into Joe's ear, "But, Joe, we
haven't voted this guy in yet."
"Well," said Joe to the rushee, shifting his battle
strategy, "it sure is nice you've decided to join. Now
we've got to vote to see whether we accept your
acceptance."

of perspiration-inducing pressure, the rushee gave
in and said that he'd join.
It was at this juncture that the president of the
club, who had gotten wind of what was happening,
came up and whispered into Joe's ear, "But, Joe, we
haven't voted this guy in yet."
"Well," said Joe to the rushee, shifting his battle
strategy, "it sure is nice you've decided to join. Now
we've got to vote to see whether we accept your
acceptance."

Gene Katnik, comedian of the SAE house, was
showing a rushee around during open house. The
frosh was obviously impressed, because just before
leaving, he asked, "Say, 1 like your house. Where do
1 sign up for it?"

A freshman at a Zete open house informed one of
the brothers, "Your house is sure nice, but it's cer
tainly not as big as that nice-looking fraternity house
up on the hill."
"That," said the Zete, looking out of the window,
"is the Knoll."

HELL WEEK FLASHBACK. In a recent hell
week episode, a pledge at one of the houses was
dumped penniless on a lonely road on Mount Diablo.
Fifty feet away was a Ford with a key in it.
"Well," thought the pledge, "those actives aren't
such bad guys after all. They left me a car with
which to go home."
The pledge climbed in the car, roared off for the
Farm, thinking nice thoughts about the sweet brothers
back in the house. In the meantime, a statewide alarm
w;;S being sounded for the Ford. Which wasn't left
by the brothers at all, but rather belonged to a Mount
Diablo resident.

ORCHIDS DEPT. We can't put this column to bed
without a big six for Dorothy Dodge, who sputters
her last as Daily editor this week. She was probably

one of the most criticized editors the Daily ever hud
by virtue of the uncomplicated fact that she is a
Democrat on a Republican campus during an election
year. And yet she did her job ably, yes brilliantly.
She handled the election issue smartly, having both
sides presented and turned in one of the best jobs of
Daily editorship we have seen.

TWO VOTES Joe, who plays linebacker on the
fpotball team, is one of the Breakers Eating Club's top
rushers. He was informed by one of the members last
week that there was one rushee who was a hot pros
pect and that he should work on him.
Joe accepted the challenge, button-holed the pros
pect, and took him outside the door. Joe went to
work with some silver-tongued oration that would
have put William Jennings Bryan to shame. He told
him about the grand tradition of the Breakers, how
they had four starters on the 1941 Rose Bowl team,
what a great bunch of guys they were, and about
the big wheels in the club. Finally, after 15 minutes
of perspiration-inducing pressure, the rushee gave
in and said that he'd join.
