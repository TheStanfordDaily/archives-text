## Objection to 'Sahara' 
### 
To the Editor:
I am one of the ASSU scholars, I am from Germany
and ctudy political science and international relations.
I have now been here for about 4 months, and I am
really impressed by your great country. But my
enthusiasm about the openmindedness in the Amer
ican way of thinking got a slight blow when I saw
l;ist Sunday's show.
1943 or 1953?
"Sahara," Stanford's flick last Sunday, would have
been a good propaganda show during the last war.
This was initiated by the Nazis, and the Amer
icans won it. Therefore, legally there is nothing
wrong with showing such pictures. But is it also
morally right? The leaders of the nation advocate

reconciliation and co-operation, because they know
that both sides must be able to forget if a new under
standing of the nations shall be accomplished. I can
imagine that many German veterans —and not every
German soldier was a Nazi—wouldn't like to join a
new army together with American boys, if they
would know that these boys are still today laughing
when they see how the friends of these veterans lost
their lives on the battlefield. The American people
doesn't trust the democratic German government when
it reads in a magazine about neo-nazism. Can the
German people have confidence in the American gov
ernment when the public opinion in this country still
favors such movies?
