# Need Posters? Publicity? Information? Pub Rel Com Gives Project Counseling
## 
### JANE LINDEMUTH 
Want to know how to plan a
successful carnival publicity
campaign? Need posters and
want someone to make them?
Ask any of the Public Relations
Committee's 17 members—and
they will help you with both in
formation and ideas.
The idea for the committee was
proposed two years ago by Gordon
Addison, former Daily editor. Fur
ther plans were made by Harvey
Segall, last year's committee chair
man. Adding ideas of her own, this
year's director, Nancy Clark, aids
the committee in effectively turn
ing plans into reality.
Climaxing two years of research,
Pub Rel Com now actively carries
out a three-fold purpose: (1) pro
moting good public relations for the
student body and executive com
mittee; (2) administrating and co
ordinating campus publicity; (3)
providing information and cam
paign counseling.
In advising and counseling or
ganizations concerning publicity
and public relations problems, the
Committee has made available a
publicity media file compiled by
its members and stationed for
public use in the committee's
third-floor Student Union office.
Included in the file is informa
tion concerning poster artists and
prices, directions and rental fees
for use of the committee's silk
screen. The screen was employed
this year to make ASSU Christmas
cards sent out to community and
faculty on behalf of the student
body, and for posters such as those
used for the Co-Rec "Winter
Whirl" dance.

Other information is included on
the use of the public address sys
tem, Bookstore, banner, commer
cial advertising rates for the Daily,
Chaparral, television, radio, and
magazines, and general information

Public Relations Committee
will hold interviews today for
students who are interested in
managing the banner in front of
the Cellar. The interviews will
be held in the committee's office
in the Union from 3 to 4 p.m.

directory. The committee also has a
social directory of entertainment
spots compiled with the co-opera
tion of entertainment managers in
the Stanford area.
Activities of the committee in
clude co-ordination of all pub
licity on campus and aid for the
ASSU in building and maintain
ing a "friendly, positive, co-oper
ative feeling between student
body and faculty members by
encouraging faculty-student gath
erings and teas."
In exploring the field of student
faculty relations, Pub Rel Com is
stimulating additional social func
tions such as the recent Lathrop-
Storey houses' joint faculty tea. A
letter requesting faculty members
to act as patrons for dances is be
ing prepared by the group.
Some of the publicity campaigns
advised by Pub Rel Com during the
autumn quarter included those for
the Women's Row Carnival, Inter-
Club Dance, Homecoming and Float
Parade, Big Game Week, and Ram's
Head Gaieties.

Also completed was a revision
of the office directory, publica
tion of student activities book
lets, weekly arrangement of the
campus events calendar posted
in front of the Cellar, and writ
ing letters of appreciation, con
gratulation, or recommendation at
the request of the Executive
Committee or ASSU president.
Committee members, in addition
to Director Clark, who are working
to make good public relations a part
of Stanford life are: Barry Galvin,
campaign manager; Chris Field, as
sistant director; Mary Kay Man
ning, office manager; Betty Mack,
secretary; Nancy Coe, assistant
secretary; Marjorie Kelsey, treas
urer; Roberta Parker, art director;
Clare Caldwell and Mary Peden,
faculty relations; Sam Freshman
and Dick Maltzman, community re
lations; Ned Wilson, banner; Fay
Erwin and Sylvia Levin, campaigns;
George Weintz, inter-college rela
tions; and Willie Leong, silk screen.
In the midst of these activities,
Pub Rel Com is planning an ac
tive program to encompass more
publicity and public relations
service, to promote good relations
within campus organizations and
with the community, between
colleges, and with California high
schools. Work in this area has
been described by Director Clark
as "sort of like hunting about in
a dark room for the light switch."
"It will probably take some time
for the light to go on," Nancy says.
"We just hope that the foundation
laid this year will be a sufficient
basis for further growth in the
ASSU public relations field."

been described by Director Clark
as "sort of like hunting about in
a dark room for the light switch."
"It will probably take some time
for the light to go on," Nancy says.
"We just hope that the foundation
laid this year will be a sufficient
basis for further growth in the
ASSU public relations field."

Want to know how to plan a
successful carnival publicity
campaign? Need posters and
want someone to make them?
Ask any of the Public Relations
Committee's 17 members—and
they will help you with both in
formation and ideas.
The idea for the committee was
proposed two years ago by Gordon
Addison, former Daily editor. Fur
ther plans were made by Harvey
Segall, last year's committee chair
man. Adding ideas of her own, this
year's director, Nancy Clark, aids
the committee in effectively turn
ing plans into reality.
Climaxing two years of research,
Pub Rel Com now actively carries
out a three-fold purpose: (1) pro
moting good public relations for the
student body and executive com
mittee; (2) administrating and co
ordinating campus publicity; (3)
providing information and cam
paign counseling.
In advising and counseling or
ganizations concerning publicity
and public relations problems, the
Committee has made available a
publicity media file compiled by
its members and stationed for
public use in the committee's
third-floor Student Union office.
Included in the file is informa
tion concerning poster artists and
prices, directions and rental fees
for use of the committee's silk
screen. The screen was employed
this year to make ASSU Christmas
cards sent out to community and
faculty on behalf of the student
body, and for posters such as those
used for the Co-Rec "Winter
Whirl" dance.

Other information is included on
the use of the public address sys
tem, Bookstore, banner, commer
cial advertising rates for the Daily,
Chaparral, television, radio, and
magazines, and general information

will hold interviews today for
students who are interested in
managing the banner in front of
the Cellar. The interviews will
be held in the committee's office

social directory of entertainment
spots compiled with the co-opera
tion of entertainment managers in
the Stanford area.
Activities of the committee in
clude co-ordination of all pub
licity on campus and aid for the
ASSU in building and maintain
ing a "friendly, positive, co-oper
ative feeling between student
body and faculty members by
encouraging faculty-student gath
erings and teas."
In exploring the field of student
faculty relations, Pub Rel Com is
stimulating additional social func
tions such as the recent Lathrop-
Storey houses' joint faculty tea. A
letter requesting faculty members
to act as patrons for dances is be
ing prepared by the group.
Some of the publicity campaigns
advised by Pub Rel Com during the
autumn quarter included those for
the Women's Row Carnival, Inter-
Club Dance, Homecoming and Float
Parade, Big Game Week, and Ram's
Head Gaieties.

Also completed was a revision
of the office directory, publica
tion of student activities book
lets, weekly arrangement of the
campus events calendar posted
in front of the Cellar, and writ
ing letters of appreciation, con
gratulation, or recommendation at
the request of the Executive
Committee or ASSU president.
Committee members, in addition
to Director Clark, who are working
to make good public relations a part
of Stanford life are: Barry Galvin,
campaign manager; Chris Field, as
sistant director; Mary Kay Man
ning, office manager; Betty Mack,
secretary; Nancy Coe, assistant
secretary; Marjorie Kelsey, treas
urer; Roberta Parker, art director;
Clare Caldwell and Mary Peden,
faculty relations; Sam Freshman
and Dick Maltzman, community re
lations; Ned Wilson, banner; Fay
Erwin and Sylvia Levin, campaigns;
George Weintz, inter-college rela

In the midst of these activities,
Pub Rel Com is planning an ac

publicity and public relations
service, to promote good relations
within campus organizations and
with the community, between

been described by Director Clark
as "sort of like hunting about in
a dark room for the light switch."
"It will probably take some time
for the light to go on," Nancy says.
"We just hope that the foundation
laid this year will be a sufficient
basis for further growth in the
ASSU public relations field."

Want to know how to plan a
successful carnival publicity
campaign? Need posters and
want someone to make them?
Ask any of the Public Relations
Committee's 17 members—and
they will help you with both in
formation and ideas.
The idea for the committee was
proposed two years ago by Gordon
Addison, former Daily editor. Fur
ther plans were made by Harvey
Segall, last year's committee chair
man. Adding ideas of her own, this
year's director, Nancy Clark, aids
the committee in effectively turn
ing plans into reality.
Climaxing two years of research,
Pub Rel Com now actively carries
out a three-fold purpose: (1) pro
moting good public relations for the
student body and executive com
mittee; (2) administrating and co
ordinating campus publicity; (3)
providing information and cam
paign counseling.
In advising and counseling or
ganizations concerning publicity
and public relations problems, the
Committee has made available a
publicity media file compiled by
its members and stationed for
public use in the committee's
third-floor Student Union office.
Included in the file is informa
tion concerning poster artists and
prices, directions and rental fees
for use of the committee's silk
screen. The screen was employed
this year to make ASSU Christmas
cards sent out to community and
faculty on behalf of the student
body, and for posters such as those
used for the Co-Rec "Winter
Whirl" dance.

Other information is included on
the use of the public address sys
tem, Bookstore, banner, commer
cial advertising rates for the Daily,
Chaparral, television, radio, and
magazines, and general information

students who are interested in

social directory of entertainment
spots compiled with the co-opera
tion of entertainment managers in
the Stanford area.
Activities of the committee in

licity on campus and aid for the
ASSU in building and maintain
ing a "friendly, positive, co-oper
ative feeling between student
body and faculty members by
encouraging faculty-student gath
erings and teas."
In exploring the field of student
faculty relations, Pub Rel Com is
stimulating additional social func
tions such as the recent Lathrop-
Storey houses' joint faculty tea. A
letter requesting faculty members
to act as patrons for dances is be
ing prepared by the group.
Some of the publicity campaigns
advised by Pub Rel Com during the
autumn quarter included those for
the Women's Row Carnival, Inter-
Club Dance, Homecoming and Float
Parade, Big Game Week, and Ram's
Head Gaieties.

Also completed was a revision
of the office directory, publica
tion of student activities book
lets, weekly arrangement of the
campus events calendar posted
in front of the Cellar, and writ
ing letters of appreciation, con
gratulation, or recommendation at
the request of the Executive
Committee or ASSU president.

to Director Clark, who are working
to make good public relations a part
of Stanford life are: Barry Galvin,
campaign manager; Chris Field, as
sistant director; Mary Kay Man
