This morning we write our final column as Sports Editor ol the Stanford
Daily. But today is not the yesterday we knew four years ago.
We have changed as all things and all persons do. We are not the hero
worshipping lad of four years ago, who thought winning, Stanford winning,
was the supreme, and a loss something to be avoided at all costs, something
that saddened us deeply.
Over the years we have become hardened to losses realizing that "you
can't win them all" is a very true axiom. And we have realized that
athletics and especially athletics at Stanford are only a way to a better
man, they mean nothing more here on Che Farm, they never should.
But this process of learning the place of athletics in Stanford lile was a
long slow one, not something that happened in a twinkling, but rather
something which took the full course of four years.
We have seen two great victories against USC down South, we have
seen a Hose Bowl team, a Rose Bowl game. We have seen a championship
baseball team. We have felt (he spirit of the Stanford crew. We have
seen overtime basketball wins, and we have seen experiences in every
sport which have made us proud of Stanford.
We have suffered through three big game defeats, oath less bitter to
swallow than the former. We have seen a gentleman coach bow out
and a boy coach come in. We have seen a basketball coach switch his
ability to baseball and a. frosh cage coach assume the responsibilities of
head basketball coach.
We have seen the McColls, the Mathias, the Tuckers, the Yardleys, the
Kerkorians, the Chezes, all the great Stanford names that gave their
school their' best in the past four years. We have seen them win, we have
seen them lose.
And we have lived the joys and suffered the heartbreaks of these
events. And as we look back they insl don't seem as important as they
did, though the memories of the joys and sorrows will always be with
us.
But we have changed and our writings have reflected that change
reducing athletics from what we once considered the superlative to just
another phase of the Stanford Utopia, a phase that is a part of the whole,
a part of University life'.
The wins, the losses, the new and old coaches, the stars have all passed
over that most brutal of grindstones, TIME. A grindstone which at first
gives them brilliance, lustre, and significance, but in the long run, wears
them down, dulls them, and reduces them to their proper perspective in
the world about us.
And in a similar manner that same grindstone has worn down our only
too brief period as Sports Editor to only a few remaining days, time enough
to thank the sports staff for their fine work and co-operation, turn the head
chair over to the new sport editor, and bow out asking that only one
thought be retained when that next Stanford loss seems so severely bitter:
Stanford athletics are only the means to a better man, nothing more.
