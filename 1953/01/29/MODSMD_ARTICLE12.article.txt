# Lost!
## 
### 
A brown bass drum has been lost
or stolen from the Stanford band
house. In reporting the loss last
night, Dwight Allen said someone
may have borrowed the drum and
forgotten to return it.
Allen asked that the drum be re
turned to the band house, or that
anyone having any information
about it call him at Room 122,
Toyon.
