with the AWS and WAA electior
i scheduled for the same date.
The amendment was mtroduc
into the Excom meeting by Jo ; -•>

Houser, representing Cardinal
which had sponsored its develop
ment.
The new plan would provide
for popular election of the fout
assistant yell leaders. (Under tin
present procedure the head yell
leader chooses his assistants.)
The proposal is a reformulation
of similar suggestions that In <
arisen in the past. Its promoi- i
feel that the appointment rathe
than the election of yell leadei ...
sistants is an undemocratic p»
tice.

tion for a year before «•!»:«<ie>",
one as leader.
The proposed system is acf.uall
revival of one that had been in u.
until 1948. Triolo (who wa
yell leader here in 1935) hat
both plans in action and advoc u
a return to the old one.
