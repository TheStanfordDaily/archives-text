# Excom Studies Church's Role
## 
### 
"What suggestions have you to of
fer which will help the Memorial
Church to live up to its function as
the center of campus life?"
This plea was posed to Excom last I
night by Herb Long of the Memorial
Church Committee. Long stated that
his committe, is now "more or less"
a group of interested students ap
pointed by previous members, but
that it desires to make itself repre
sentative of the student body.
Guy 3houp and Ellie Myers were
asked by ASSU president Dick Weis
mann to be voluntary members of
the Church Committee to work with
it on any ideas Excom might come
up with for improving its role.
Excom also heard progress reports
on a couple of events still in the
planning stage, the Winter Quarter
Charity Drive and the Y Workshop.
Don Lozabnick, chairman of the
charity drive, introduced Roberta
Wilson, field secretary for the World
University Service, which will re
ceive half the proceeds of the drive.
Miss Wilson, who graduated from
Redlands only last year, outlined to
Excom some of WUS' service to what
she termed the "world university
community."
iVUS, which is now operating in
32 countries in every area of the
world except Africa, South America,
and behind the Iron Curtain, oper
ates on a basis of helping universi
ties to help themselves, Miss Wilson
pointed out.
This philosophy, she said, makes
WUS aid not a "dole," but a "help"
toward what is recognized as a "val
uable goal."
Ann Irving, co-chairman of the Y
Workshop, reported that plans were
shaping into final form for that event,
which will be held Feb. 14. "A look
at the past with an eye toward the
future" has been selected as a theme
for the conference discussions, which
will deal with problems in campus
organizations, Miss Irving said.
