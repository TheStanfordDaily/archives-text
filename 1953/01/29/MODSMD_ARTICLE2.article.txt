### NAN CERINI 
Nathan Milstein, violinist, will
present the third concert in this
year's ASSU Concert Series when
he plays at Memorial Auditorium
Saturday night at 8:15.
Milstein was born in Russia but
became an American citizen in De
cember, 1942. He began studying
the violin not because he was
drawn to it, but because his mother
made him. According to him, "It
was only when I had progressed
far enough to feel the music itself
in my playing that I practiced will
ingly and eagerly."
His first teacher was Stoliarsky
in his native city of Odessa, and
later he went to Petrograd to study
with Leopold Auer, who was also
the instructor of Jascha Heifetz.
When Milstein went to Belgium to
study with Eugene Ysaye, that vio
linist thought so highly of Milstein's
technique and virtuosity that he
simply said, "Go â€”there is nothing
I can teach you."
Milstein played in public when
he was ten years old, but he did
not follow up this initial appear
ance with a career as a child
prodigy, lie made his first con
cert toUr of Russia at 19, fre
quently playing joint recitals
with his close friend, the pianist
Vladimir Horowitz.
In 1925 Milstein went to Paris,
and then he began the first of his
many tours of European music cen
ters. He made his debut in the
United States in 1929 with the Phil
adelphia Orchestra. Then he played
with the New York Philharmonic-
Symphony, with which he has now
reappeared 49 times.
Now 47, Milstein has made 23
tours of the United States and Can
ada and innumerable tours of Eu

! rope. In his post - war European
tour in 1947 his recital and orches
tral appearances included Copen
: hagen, Stockholm. Brussels, Paris,
i London, Zurich, and Lucerne. He
1 has toured Latin America and Mejt
ico three times, and he has played
in Egypt, Israel, and Palestine.
Milstein is also a composer. He
has written Cadenzas for the
Brahms Concerto and for the
Beethoven Violin Concerto, as
well as "Patfaniniana," which is
based on variations on the theme
of Paganini's 24th Caprice.
