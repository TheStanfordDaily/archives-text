# A 						Progressive Step
## 
### 
Bouquets of the morning goes to the School
of Engineering for a most progressive step in
the development of esgineering education.
The school has recently completed arrange
ments with three small liberal aris colleges-r-
Knox, in Illinois, the College of Idaho, and an
other as yet unnamed —by which students may
study three years at the liberal arts schools,
then two' more in an engineering program at
Stanford, and receive for his efforts an A.B.
from his first alma mater and a B.S. in engineer
ing from Stanford.
The general dual degree idea has been kick
ing around in the East for about ten years now
with MIT and Columbia rated the pioneers.
Stanford has become the first school on the Pa
cific Coast to initiate such a program.
Since the benefits from the idea are many,
we'd like to list a few down as they pertain to
the various parties concerned.
First, to the student. A prospective engineer
ing major will now have the opportunity to re
ceive three years of "general" education in
cluding his math and science at a top-notch
small school—possibly near his home- before
embarking on his professional training.
He'll have all the advantages of a small,
closely knit campus—yet he'll know that his
credits will measure up and that he won't lose
part or all of a year transfering to an engineer
ing school.
If there is in his family a tradition of enroll
ment at a small liberal arts college of long stand
ing or a desire to attend a denominational col
lege, the student will be able to fulfill it with

out placing his engineering ambitions in dan
ger.
To the liberal arts college the program will
enable them to attract many students who
would otherwise look only to a larger school,
because the larger school could offer the engi
neering training. Knox now has dual degree
agreements with both Columbia in the East and
Stanford in the West.
To Stanford the program will attract worth
while students who would not otherwise attend,
because they desire either the small school
environment or more liberal arts education than
can be fitted into a four year engineering cur
riculum.
The dual degree program is also a step to
ward answering critics who argue loudly that
an engineering training turns out men who
may be skilled technicians, but who fail to ful
fill the need for really educated citizens.
Extension of the program is now underway.
Negotiations are under consideration at other
similar colleges.
There is one further extension we can think
of. Though Stanford now offers a five year en
gineering program within its own curriculum,
it is confined chiefly to men who are enrolled
in an ROTC program, the ROTC study account
ing for the fifth year.
We believe that an effort should be made to
interest more engineering students in a fifth
year of study. The added general education
courses they will'be able to take will provide
rich dividends in the next forty or fifty years
of their lives.—Jim Madison
