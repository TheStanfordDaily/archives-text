# BULL SESSION
## 
### SAM FRESHMAN 
Ever since my colleague Pete Groth exposed the
secret workings of the DAILY I have been thinking
(and believe me it's a real strain, try it sometime).
Now that you know what goes on at the paper it
might be a good idea if you knew what goes inside
tlier organizations. Today's victim—Ram's Head.

Despite rumors to the contrary
Ram's head is not a secret society
of ex-shepherds who wish to drain
Lagunita and use it as a pasture.
In fact, as with every student
government board, nobody is
sure what it is but it must be
something because it takes up
several pages in the Quad.
Headquarters of this actor's
guild is known as Ram's Bottom
(often referred to by other names)

and resides in a linen closet on the third floor of
th< student union.
At last the time has come to name names (it
impresses people) and look "inside Ram's Head."
INSIDE RAM'S IIEAI)
When a campus organization does something really
constructive, it deserves praise and recognition. The
A HSU dramatic board, Ram's Head, next week will
put. on a variety show at Paly High to improve rela
tions between that school and Stanford. This is by far
one of the most concrete steps toward good university
public relations taken this year with the possible ex
ception of Cardinal's decision to hold last quarter's
homecoming parade in Palo Alto
Organizing the show is $Bert Burns who will be
assisted by Ron Louis, George Frakes, Suzy Marion,
$Pat Currier, and the poor man's Milton Berle, Richie

Meyer. Ram's Head's prexy, $Hal Burdick, will be
M.C. while Quad Editor $Rocky Harris and Ram's
Head business manager $"Shylock" Cohen will run
through their now infamous "Herr' act from the "52
Gaities."
Burns will be supplied with 200 assistants each of
whom will show up two minutes before curtain time
with forged high school hall passes saying their
teachers let them out of class to help backstage. In
a preliminary meeting Bert is reported as saying,
"Let's make this a great show men, but remember
keep it sterile! We can't corrupt these kids."
Now that we know what it's doing, let's see what
Ram's Head has to offer in the campus. Among its
assets is one of the sexiest looking vice-presidents in
campus activities, SMelba Wiser, and the "Cyd Cha
risse" of the peninsula, $Joan Hunt. The group has its
own version of Sandor Salgo in $Clark Linsey and
boasts of $Dick Rare who is reputed to be a sort of
combination Rogers & Hammerstein and Sigmund
Romberg.
The"I. Stanford Jolly" is $Steve Stevens while
$Dick Hay is sort of a "jack of all trades" (all trades?).
Others include technical director SHoward Brown and
scores more of what are described in old Stanford
Handbooks as really "fascinating" people.
The group has its serious moments too, such as
when they voted $16,000 of their production profits
accumulated over many years to establish a speech
and drama scholarship.
Contrary to popular opinion you do not necessarily
have to be an extrovert to participate in Ram's Head
productions. About 200 Stanfordites do it every year
and they can't all be extroverts (or can they?).

M.C. while Quad Editor $Rocky Harris and Ram's
Head business manager $"Shylock" Cohen will run
through their now infamous "Herr' act from the "52
Gaities."
Burns will be supplied with 200 assistants each of
whom will show up two minutes before curtain time
with forged high school hall passes saying their
teachers let them out of class to help backstage. In
a preliminary meeting Bert is reported as saying,
"Let's make this a great show men, but remember
keep it sterile! We can't corrupt these kids."
Now that we know what it's doing, let's see what
Ram's Head has to offer in the campus. Among its
assets is one of the sexiest looking vice-presidents in
campus activities, SMelba Wiser, and the "Cyd Cha
risse" of the peninsula, $Joan Hunt. The group has its
own version of Sandor Salgo in $Clark Linsey and
boasts of $Dick Rare who is reputed to be a sort of
combination Rogers & Hammerstein and Sigmund
Romberg.
The"I. Stanford Jolly" is $Steve Stevens while
$Dick Hay is sort of a "jack of all trades" (all trades?).
Others include technical director SHoward Brown and
scores more of what are described in old Stanford
Handbooks as really "fascinating" people.
The group has its serious moments too, such as
when they voted $16,000 of their production profits
accumulated over many years to establish a speech
and drama scholarship.
Contrary to popular opinion you do not necessarily
have to be an extrovert to participate in Ram's Head
productions. About 200 Stanfordites do it every year
and they can't all be extroverts (or can they?).

Ever since my colleague Pete Groth exposed the
secret workings of the DAILY I have been thinking
(and believe me it's a real strain, try it sometime).
Now that you know what goes on at the paper it
might be a good idea if you knew what goes inside
tlier organizations. Today's victim—Ram's Head.

Despite rumors to the contrary
Ram's head is not a secret society
of ex-shepherds who wish to drain
Lagunita and use it as a pasture.
In fact, as with every student
government board, nobody is
sure what it is but it must be
something because it takes up
several pages in the Quad.
