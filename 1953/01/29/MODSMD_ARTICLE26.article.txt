# ANOTHER HIT
## New Guinness Movie Is Featured at Guild 
### MARY FRAZER 
Alec Guinness as "The Promoter"
Is once again his delightfully comic
self the implacable little man, al
ways one (and usually two) up on
the world.
"The Promoter" is the rags-to
riches story of E. H. Machin, collec
tor of rents, lender of money, even
tually financier and mayor of the
town. Who and what is he, asks a
disgruntled former employer? The
Countess of Chell answers:
"if" is identified with the general
business of cheering us all up." As
a tribute to Guinness' comic art,
the Countess has said a mouthful.
The film is filled with the delght
fully :-übtle.nnd witty dialogue and
incident so peculiar to Guinness'
I '■ t portrayals. The lift of an eye
blow, the choice of a single, per
fectly ironic phrase can convulse an
audience far more thoroughly than
an hour of Hollywood slapstick.

Unlike the man in the white suit,
E. H. Machin triumphs against a
stufFy society. This, in fine, is the
germ of his comic art, as the suc
cess of "Kind Hearts and Coronets"
previously indicated.
Glynis Johns' handling of the vix
enish Miss Earp is excellent as well.
An essentially stock role has become
fascinating and subtle in her (and
the script writer's) hands.
"The Promoter" is one of the
most delightful cinematic events of
the year. Nobody leaves the Guild
Theater without a smile on his face
after two hours of Guinness, and
especially so in this case.
