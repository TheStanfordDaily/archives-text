# Horn Enjoys Manager's Job
## 
### BOB REZAK 
Serving as financial manager
to the ASSU and some 250 stu
dent organizations is "fun—not
work" for Steve Horn.
As Student Manager, Horn's
job is to supervise and direct
the only completely student-run
financial organization in the na
tion.
"It's a job," lie said, "that grew
with Stanford and it's sort of
unique to it." Most other colleges
and universities have graduate
managers who control only certain
phases of student finance, he ex
plained.
"For nostalgia's sake," Horn said,
"wo like to think Herbert Hoover
was the first Student Manager," al
though the office as such didn't ex
ist at the time the former President
attended the University.
But Mr. Hoover handled essen
tially many of the same duties
now handled hy the Student
Manager.
Excom minutes in 1910 recorded
the first mention of a "Student
Manager." It wasn't, however, un
til 1919 that the official title came
into existence.
Today, under a progressive pro
gram that reflects an awareness of
and an interest in the expansion of
the University, the office lias be
come greatly enlarged. Duties and
responsibilities similarly have in
creased.
This is further evidenced by the
growth in size of the Student
Manager's annual report.
The first detailed report, issued
in 1924, is a slim black volume com
pared to the weighty tome prepared
by the Student Manager in 1951.
In the early days the Student
Manager supervised the funds for
about 60 campus organizations. Now
that figure has increased nearly
four times with a total fund that
nears the half-million-dollar mark.
"I never touch <or see a penny
of any funds," Horn said. "My
job consists prunarily of author
izing expenditures and signing all
payment orders and budgets."
And the vibrant, almost inex
haustible Student Manager said he
has never had an accounting course
or fiscal planning lesson in his life.
"In a job like this," he related, "it
merely depends on how you want
to handle financial control. There
are no codified duties connected
with the office."
Since last April, when he was ap
pointed to the job by University
Financial Manager Alf Brandin,
Horn has believed the best way he
could serve effectively was to un->
deistand all organizations and their
plans.
As a result,-he attends as many
organization meetings as time will
permit.
On the average he puts in six
hours a day, although his official
time schedule calls for three office
hours. Invariably he works over
time—sometimes as long as 20 hours

—reading detailed reports, some of
which contain 60 pages, dictating
letters, or "trying to catch up" on
his work.
But Horn wants additional time
to devote to meeting with commit
tees and department heads to "in
still programs and get them to work
to their fullest advantage."
In his long - range objectives,
Horn tries to emphasize the prac
tical educational aspects of stu

dent activities.
"I don't feel students should be
doing something just to be doing
it,"he declared emphatically.
Horn views his job as a "com
munications service, a guide on
where to get answers for effective
financial administration, since fi
nances are the basis of student ac
tivities."
"The job offers a perspective on
all student groups," Horn believes.
