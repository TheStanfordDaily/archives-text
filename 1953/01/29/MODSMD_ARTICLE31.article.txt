# DEALING THE CARDS
## A 						Sort of a Saga 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
This is a story as old as Stanford itself—the story of Stanford track. It
is the story of greatness, a story of untiring effort by little known athletes,
a story of a little school in the west that blazed a name for itself across the
nation with athletes whose names arose only after their college days had
begun.
The story starts in 1893. Bitter years came and went, with a win hungry
bunch of Indian thinclads sticking it out. Finally, after eleven years of com
petition, they finally broke the ice and beat the hated Bears in the Big Meet.
From there it was a story of greatness. Of outstanding athletes and of
outstanding teams. Of the Stanfords breaking world /ecord after world
record,
It is the story of the six men on the '25 team that had to beg their way
back to the NCAA meet only to shatter a great Michigan team and walk
Poff with all the marbles. It is the tale of all-time greats like Ben Eastmen.
who held the world marks in the 440, 880, 600, and 1000-yard races before
he was 21, of George Horine who created the Western Roll and set the
world mark assunder at (1-7 in the '27 Olympic Trials, of Jack Weiershauser,
our present coach and the man Dink Templeton calls "The Iron Man of
Stanford Track." who ran the quarter, furlong, century, and low sticks with
speed enough to win them all, of Clyde Jeffrey and his 9.4-hundred, and
of the multitude more. It goes on further, to the story of 1934's "Seven
Avengers," who walked off top dogs in both the NCAA and IC4A, and
did it against great competition. And leave us not forget the 1927, '28, and
'29 teams—three year national champions and we did it without buying
up every trackman that could walk.
Yes, the Stanford teams were great. In one short column we can't go
into a part of the memorable things they did. Dink Templeton does a
masterful job of digging out the highlights in "Great Moments in Stanford
Sports." But why were they great? We were small while other schools
were big, we didn't offer scholarships and we didn't have easy entrance
requirements while other schools did. How did we win?
The Ageless Question
The answer is simple—the Stanfords loved track. In the spring, from
every fraternity house and eating club, from every off-campus residence,
from Encina, from Toyon, from the depths of the library they came. They
didn't have names and great reputations, they weren't bought, they weren't
out just for the glory—they loved the sport, and we think they must have
loved the school, too. But no matter what brought them out, they came.
They weren't good, but they had potential. Our coach, „the great Harry
Maloney, Stanford's old one man Athletic Department, Rick and Dink
Templeton, and Jack Weiershauser worked with the men, taught them the
tricks and the knacks, made them good, made them athletes. And they
won races.
But there arose many factors to change all that. The school grew and
the closeness, the solidarity thai used to exist has somehow shrunk a
little. Sports became a big business, and the athlete became a specialist.
The football-basketball-trackman has now become a rarity. The athletes
are still there and the abilities are still there, but the interest is lacking.
And it isn't the fault of Stanford by a long shot. Far to the South,
about 400 miles to be exact, an institution known as the University of
Southern California decided that it had to win and damn the cost—and it
wins. It doesn't win the way Stanford used to, with volunteers in scivies
running for the love of the sport and the love of their school, but it wins
with 36 full time track scholarships and low entrance requirements. It wins
with what might be called a junior college farm system.. And it wins with
the aid of the old Stanford jinx.
Are Those Days Gone Forever?
For let us not think for a minute that the modern day teams of the
Gay Bryans and Bob Mathias's still aren't great. In our books, there never
was a Trojan team that could compare to an Indian team in spirit and
drive and we wouldn't give up what we have here for a thousand Trojan
type wins. But still, deep in the recesses of the fraternities and clubs,
Encina, the Village, Stern, and etc., there are athletes who have the po-

tential, who have the material to be worked with, and who could be just
the spark to lead the Cards on to more days of greatness on the nation's
ovels. These are the boys that claim "they're not good enough," the boys
who go out but never quite try, the boys with "too many things to do."
These are the boys who's ancestors were the greats of yesteryear, whose
decedents may yet.be the greats of tomorrow. These may be the boys to
break the Stanford jinx and yet lead the Cards to victory over the men of
Troy. And this just might be the year we do it.
For those who don't know, the Stanford jinx is that mysterious being
that lets an Indian run a 1:52 against the Olympic Club and pull up a laim
against SC, that mysterious thing that always seems to cripple the Cards
when that time rolls around for the annual try against Troy.
To beat it, it will require more depth, more men out, more develop
ment of athletes, more interested in the sport itself. Stanford can do it, and
we feel the men of Stanford will do it. Only time will tell, but that old
attitude seems to be creeping out again. Down at Angel Field a few new
faces are popping up—fellows that are coming out for the first time, or
who are moving up from the rpural ranks. But still it isn't enough. Men
like Jim Mclndoe in the pole vault and Don Carlson in almost any event
men who could if they'd only really get out and try. These men are the
men we need, and more. This change of attitude is what we cry for
and plead for.
And without it—we can only hope and wish the team good luck, and
God speed.
(Next week, a breakdown on just what we can expect from Stanford
track this year.)

shaved a second off of it.
