# Cards Face Broncs, Gaels In Twin Bills This Week
## 
### 
Stanford's ice-cold varsity, straight
from a triple beating in the islands
and at present riding the top of a
five game streak (losing), will tee off
this weekend with a pair of the coasts
top independents, Santa Clara and
St. Mary's in the annual Confer
ence vs. Independent Round Robin.
The Cards go with Santa Clara in
the 8 o'clock opener Friday night
while Cal takes on St. Mary's in the
9:30 nightcap. Saturday, the Cards
switch times and teams, taking on
St. Mary's in the late game while
Cal takes on Santa Clara in the
opener. The Saturday night opener
with Cal will be televised.
The incentives are there to make
this one the Agamemnon of North
ern California basketball. Nibs
Price's Bears are at present leading
the PCC by two games in the South
ern Division with a 5-1 record, and
need the wins to move up in na
tional ratings.
Santa Clara, perennial strong men
on the hardwoods, have again come
up with a crackerjack team. They
need to win both games to streng
then their position for an NCAA in
vite. In last year's NCAA playoffs,
the Bronco's surprised all by mak
ing the finals and losing out only to
Kansas's mighty men. 74-55.
St. Mary's is in the sqme boat, but
hasn't the power that the Broncs
have.
Stanford, of course, just wants to
win.
Tickets for both double bills may

be obtained at the BAC before to
morrow noon or at the Cow Palace
for 50 cents and presentation of stu
dent body cards. Box seats are $2.00
and generals $1.50.â€”D. M.
