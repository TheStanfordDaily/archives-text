Stanford's biceps boys have found the fire, and prooeeded to
cremate San Francisco State, 34-0, Tuesday night in the first blank
ing Stanford wrestlers have given anyone in over two years.
Giving the 'Gators some credit, they were forced to forfeit the
123, 130, and heavyweight matchesâ€”probably Stanford's weak-

est events.
Outstanding match of the day
was put on by Stanford's out
standing wrestler, George Rus
sell, at 137. Russell, lust year's
PCC champ, met Phil Lyons, Ollie
Lyons' twin brother and consid
ered by experts to be on a par
with Russell and one of the
Coast's best.
Russel proved the experts wrong
as he gave one of the best perform
ances of his career. Unable to pin
"the tiger's" brother, he took an 8-3
decision, taking him down three
limes for six points and getting a
reversal for two. Giving Lyons
credit where credit is due, every
time Russell took him down he
pulled an escape, thus getting three
points.
At 147, Bob Jessen won his first
match of the season in a close tussle
with John Wilson, 5 points to 4.
Ken James also broke into the
win column lor the first time this
quarter with a hustling 7-4 win.

At HJ7, Bob Beatie continued
his phenomenal form by pinning
Joe Coming, a former Golden
Gloves champ with much mat ex
perience, in the second period.
At 177, Pat Madden's strength
was just too much as he pinned his
opponent early in the first period.
The wrestlers are now taking a
well-earned vacation before start
ing the gecond round of competi
tion. By then, it is hoped heavy
weight Phil Wilson will be ready to
go.
The Cards' next match will be
against San Diego State a week
from this Saturday here at Stan
ford.
