# Papooses Play Top Gaelbabes
## 
### 
"The best game of the year," ac- j
cording to frosh basketball coach
Dick Clegg, will be played Satur
day afternoon at 2, when the Pa
pooses host a highly touted St.
Mary's frosh team.
Friday afternoon a young but !
scrappy Lincoln High five from San
Francisco will invade the Pavilion
to meet Stanford's undefeated (9-0)
frosh team at 3.
The defensive play of the team
has been good, but a bit too ag
gressive, says Clegg. Clegg has
voiced approval of George Sellick's
court sureness. The frosh have a
high foul average and committed 33

fouls against Concordia last Friday.
The weekend games mark the
midway point in the frosh's season.
