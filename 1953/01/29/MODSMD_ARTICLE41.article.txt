# Registration To Aid Senior Job-Hunters
## 
### 
All students in their last year at
Stanford have been asked to regis
ter at the Placement Service.
By registering, the student estab
lishes the only record of his life at
Stanford that is available to future
employers. He puts on permanent
files the amount and kind of educa
tion received, a record of work ex
perience, extra-curricular activities,
and statements from professors.
However, the Placement Service
does not ask for grade records. Em
ployers may secure them only
through release by the individual.
There are three parts to the me
chanics of registration:
1. Go to the Placement Service,
Buildng 1, Inner Quad, and fill out
the proper forms as you would want
your employer to see them.
2. Have a short interview with an
assistant director.
3. Secure statements from profes
sors and people you know in extra
curricular activities.
The cost of having your name put
on permanent files is $1.00.
Eugene W. Dils, director of the
Placement Service, says, "Each
week between 40 and 50 letters are
received by Dean Balch from em
ployers and government services
who want information about for
mer Farm students seeking em
ployment. And if they are not reg
istered here, no personal record can
be furnished.
"Women in their last year of

training should register even though
their employment interests haven't
crystallized. The trend during
World War II has continuedâ€”there
are more job opportunities avail
able to women than ever before."
