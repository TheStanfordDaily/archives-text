# 'Y' Workshop Topic Chosen
## 
### 
"A Look at the Past with an Aim
Toward the Future" is the tentative
topic for the YWCA Workshop
which is scheduled for Feb. 14. This
topic will be submitted for approval
to the planning committee this af
ternoon at 4:30 in the lower lounge
of the Women's Clubhouse.
Five main discussion groups will
be set up for the Workshop. The
problems will include stimulating
participation, evaluation of your
own organization, zoning a more
cohesive student body, discipline
and authority in student body, and
traditions in review.
Under stimulating participation
such problems as ways of getting
personnel and members for such
organizations as the Daily, Cha
parral, and Quad; creating a
standardized form for interviews,
and discovering better, more ef
fective publicity techniques.
Is Excom close to the student
body and is it reflecting the student
opinion accurately? This organiza
tion plus many others will be eval
uated to see if they arc serving
their intended purposes.
The fact that all freshman men
will be living in the Village and in
Encina next year presents a real
problem as to how these off-campus
men can be integrated and made to
feel that they are a vital part of
student affairs. This and also the
problem of making foreign students
feel at home will be discussed.
The question whether all the
time and all the money which goes
into the float parade, bonfire, and
other Big Game week activities is
necessary for school spirit was
brought up by the Encina spon
sors. This will be one of the key
notes of the "Y" Workshop, Ann
Irvine, co-chairman of the planning
committee, said.
Any other suggestions for discus
sion problems may still be handed
in to the YWCA office today, Miss
Irvine announced.
Members of the committee who
selected these discussion problems
are Mike Tormey, Barry Galvin, A 1
Hilton, and Ann Irvine.
