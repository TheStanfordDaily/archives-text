INDEPENDENCE, Mo., Jan. 29 (UP) Former President Harry S.
Truman hung "pin head" and "squirrel head" tags on his congressional
critics today, and accused some of them of making "irresponsible state
ments" in the atomic bomb controversy.
Mr. Truman said he expressed doubt publicly that Russia has a work
able A-bomb "to get the record straight."
"I think wc ought to settle down and be sensible about our situation,"
he said on a walk with reporters. "We've got a job to do building up our
strength to meet anything that may come along, but meantime we've got
to go on living sensibly."
He accused his congressional opponents in the atomic bomb contro
versy of "scaring a lot of Americans to death with some irresponsible
statements."
Mr. Truman said he was gratified to read Dr. Arthur H. Compton, 1927
Nobel prize physicist, agreed with him that it was "problematical" whether
Russia has a working A bomb.
(In Norwalk, Conn., Lt. Gen. Leslie R. Groves, wartime head of the
atomic bomb project, said Mr. Truman may have been correct. But
Gordon Dean, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, said lie pre
ferred to stand on his 1951 statement: "Russia does have the bomb.")
Mr. Truman dropped into the "squirrel head" category house and
senate action curbing President Eisenhower's power to reorganize the
government.
He said the "pin heads" included congressmen who never had given
former Secretary of State Dean Acheson'credit for working with former
President Hoover in the latter's reorganization commission.
Mr. Truman said his own efforts toward reorganization were more than
all the other presidents put together.
