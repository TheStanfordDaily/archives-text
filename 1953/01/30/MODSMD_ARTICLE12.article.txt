# Cagers' Spotlight Shifts; Meet Top Independents
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
The basketball spotlight shifts
this weekend from the lush
lands of the Islands to the sag
ging hardwood of the Cow Pal
ace as Stanford's Indians and
California's Bears, representing
the PCC, vie with St. Mary's and
Santa Clara, representing top
local independents, in the battle
for Northern California suprem
acy and top national honors.
The highly touted Santa Clara
team, with much the same material
that they took to the finals of the
NCAA last year, got off to a weak
start this season but has since come
back in the old form, looking for
two more wins to strengthen their
chance for another National Tour
ney bid.
St. Mary's, also hot for an NCAA
bid, took the Broncos in the early
part of the season, but faltered
against the hustling cowboys last
Saturday, 84-56, setting a new
school scoring record. This gives
the Gaels an 8-5 season record and
the Broncs a 10-5. The Broncs also
clobbered COP, 89-51, to shatter the
same scoring mark twice in one
week.

Center man in (he independ
ents' gunsights will be big Brer
Bear from Berkeley and his fi-ft.
7 - in. point - nahber named Bob
McKeen. Coach Nibs Price's boys
also have a 9-5 season record,
but have an impressive 5-1 rec
ord against the kingfish of the
Southern Division of the PCC.
Their opposition, it must be add
ed, has been of a higher caliber
than either of the Bears' oppo
nents.
The Bears aren't short of incen
tive this weekend either. McKeen
and crew would like very much to
move up in the national ratings.
They will be hampered, however,
by a week's layoff over finals.

The varsity basketball team
elected George Zaninovich as the
team captain for the rest of the
season. Bon Wagner was elected
frosh captain.

Needless to' say, the incentives
for a Stanford win can be narrowed
down to that old expression, "It's
been so long!"
The Cards, at present riding the
crest of a five-game losing streak,
including three on their recent trip
to Hawaii, would sorely like to
break the spell.
In the words of Coach Bob
Burnett, "We've been losing, but
no one has given up. The hoys
are out there fighting hard. We
can start winning basketball
games, and we could start this
weekend."
The Cards have been working
on improving their condition af
ter their recent excursion and
have been concentrating on re
houndinff, free throws, and other
fundamentals.
Tonight in the round robin,
Stanford will face Santa Clara in
the 8 o'clock opener while Cal takes
on St. Mary's in the 9:30 nightcap,
'omorrow night positions and
itners will be reversed, with
tanford taking the late game vs. St.
lary's and Cal taking on the
.hones in the 8 o'clock tilt, which
will be televised.
Tickets may be purchased at the
ate at 50 cents for students, $1.50
or general admission, and $2 for
box seats.
Starting lineup for Stanford will
probably be Lawler at center, Don
Carlson and George Zaninovich at
forwards, and the mighty mites,
Oleg Suzdaleff and Ron Tomsic.
Bob Ogorek at forward has been
coming along well and should see
. lot of action.

Oleg Suzdaleff and Ron Tomsic.
Bob Ogorek at forward has been

The basketball spotlight shifts
this weekend from the lush
lands of the Islands to the sag
ging hardwood of the Cow Pal
ace as Stanford's Indians and
California's Bears, representing
the PCC, vie with St. Mary's and
Santa Clara, representing top
local independents, in the battle
for Northern California suprem
acy and top national honors.
The highly touted Santa Clara
team, with much the same material
that they took to the finals of the
NCAA last year, got off to a weak
start this season but has since come
back in the old form, looking for
two more wins to strengthen their
chance for another National Tour
ney bid.
St. Mary's, also hot for an NCAA
bid, took the Broncos in the early
part of the season, but faltered
against the hustling cowboys last
Saturday, 84-56, setting a new
school scoring record. This gives
the Gaels an 8-5 season record and
the Broncs a 10-5. The Broncs also
clobbered COP, 89-51, to shatter the
same scoring mark twice in one
week.

Center man in (he independ
ents' gunsights will be big Brer
Bear from Berkeley and his fi-ft.
7 - in. point - nahber named Bob
McKeen. Coach Nibs Price's boys
also have a 9-5 season record,
but have an impressive 5-1 rec
ord against the kingfish of the
Southern Division of the PCC.
Their opposition, it must be add
ed, has been of a higher caliber
than either of the Bears' oppo
nents.
The Bears aren't short of incen
tive this weekend either. McKeen
and crew would like very much to
move up in the national ratings.
They will be hampered, however,
by a week's layoff over finals.

The varsity basketball team
elected George Zaninovich as the
team captain for the rest of the
season. Bon Wagner was elected
frosh captain.

Needless to' say, the incentives
for a Stanford win can be narrowed
down to that old expression, "It's
been so long!"
The Cards, at present riding the
crest of a five-game losing streak,
including three on their recent trip
to Hawaii, would sorely like to
break the spell.
In the words of Coach Bob
Burnett, "We've been losing, but
no one has given up. The hoys
are out there fighting hard. We
can start winning basketball
games, and we could start this
weekend."
The Cards have been working
on improving their condition af
ter their recent excursion and
have been concentrating on re
houndinff, free throws, and other
fundamentals.
Tonight in the round robin,
Stanford will face Santa Clara in
the 8 o'clock opener while Cal takes
on St. Mary's in the 9:30 nightcap,
'omorrow night positions and
itners will be reversed, with
tanford taking the late game vs. St.
lary's and Cal taking on the
.hones in the 8 o'clock tilt, which
will be televised.
Tickets may be purchased at the
ate at 50 cents for students, $1.50
or general admission, and $2 for
box seats.
Starting lineup for Stanford will
probably be Lawler at center, Don
Carlson and George Zaninovich at
forwards, and the mighty mites,
Oleg Suzdaleff and Ron Tomsic.
