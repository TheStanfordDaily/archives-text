# Miss Remele Leaves Post After 33 Years
## 
### 
• Miss Miriam Remele, editorial secretary at the Stanford Regis
trar's Office, will finish her job today.
And as far as the Registrar's Office is concerned, Miss Remele's
job spans the history of the University.
She has served under all four of Stanford's registrars: Orrin L.

Elliott, J. Pearce MitcheTl, H. Don
ald Winbigler, and currently Har
vey Hall.
When she came to Stanford from
Colorado some 33 years ago, Miss
Remele wanted a part-time job for
a year. When she decided to stay,
Dr. Elliott assured her of a per
manent position if, to use her
words, "she was any good."
Since 1!)20 ivliss Remelc's offi
cial title has been "editorial sec
retary." She has been in charge
of editing all the publications in
the registrar's series — from de
tailed information bulletins issued
annually to the complicated time
schedule of classes issued quar
terly.
Miss Remele has been known, al
though indirectly in most, cases, to
every student who has been grad
uated from Stanford since 1921. She
has had the gargantuan task of ar
ranging all their diplomas. And the
task has grown from planning for
the 549 degrees awarded in 1921 to
the 2,414 awarded in 1952.
Miss Remele has also prepared
and supervised the registration

materials, which include an 18-
page booklet for each student.
Registration statistics have also
figured prominently in Miss Remc
le's job. In addition to filling out a'l
forms calling for the statistics, she
has also answered countless tele
phone queries. And, although t.hr
registrar's office is in the process
of mechanizing operations by turn
ing over some of the statistics-tak
ing to IBM machines, there's little
chance it can memorize the tele
phone inquiries.
One of her greatest tributes was
paid by President Wallace Sterling
before last year's Commencement,
audience of 6,000:
"You have just witnessed the
awarding of several hundred di
plomas. The odds arc over
whelmingly heavy that 100 per
cent of them got into the hands
for which they were intended.
This phenomenon has recurred
here annually for many years,
but not accidentally. The logis
tics of this enterprise are not sim
pie, but they are reduced to ap
parent simplicity by the work of
many heads and hands. Of thr.se,
I would beg leave to mention par
tieularly Miss Miriam Remele. . . .
"It is entirely appropriate that: hi?
be made aware publicly of our af
fection for her and of our appreci
aton of the care and legerdemain
by which she has mastered the in
tricate task of preparing and dis
pensing diplomas.
"You who may have received
them this year should count youi
selves fortunate, because next year,
without Miss Remele, anything may
happen.'" •

materials, which include an 18-
page booklet for each student.
Registration statistics have also
figured prominently in Miss Remc
le's job. In addition to filling out a'l
forms calling for the statistics, she
has also answered countless tele
phone queries. And, although t.hr
registrar's office is in the process
of mechanizing operations by turn
ing over some of the statistics-tak
ing to IBM machines, there's little
chance it can memorize the tele
phone inquiries.
One of her greatest tributes was
paid by President Wallace Sterling
before last year's Commencement,
audience of 6,000:
"You have just witnessed the
awarding of several hundred di
plomas. The odds arc over
whelmingly heavy that 100 per
cent of them got into the hands
for which they were intended.
This phenomenon has recurred
here annually for many years,
but not accidentally. The logis
tics of this enterprise are not sim
pie, but they are reduced to ap
parent simplicity by the work of
many heads and hands. Of thr.se,
I would beg leave to mention par
tieularly Miss Miriam Remele. . . .
"It is entirely appropriate that: hi?
be made aware publicly of our af
fection for her and of our appreci
aton of the care and legerdemain
by which she has mastered the in
tricate task of preparing and dis
pensing diplomas.
"You who may have received
them this year should count youi
selves fortunate, because next year,
without Miss Remele, anything may
happen.'" •
• Miss Miriam Remele, editorial secretary at the Stanford Regis
trar's Office, will finish her job today.
And as far as the Registrar's Office is concerned, Miss Remele's
job spans the history of the University.
She has served under all four of Stanford's registrars: Orrin L.

Elliott, J. Pearce MitcheTl, H. Don
ald Winbigler, and currently Har
vey Hall.
When she came to Stanford from
Colorado some 33 years ago, Miss
Remele wanted a part-time job for
a year. When she decided to stay,
Dr. Elliott assured her of a per
manent position if, to use her
words, "she was any good."
Since 1!)20 ivliss Remelc's offi
cial title has been "editorial sec
retary." She has been in charge
of editing all the publications in
the registrar's series — from de
tailed information bulletins issued
annually to the complicated time
schedule of classes issued quar
terly.
Miss Remele has been known, al
though indirectly in most, cases, to
every student who has been grad
uated from Stanford since 1921. She
has had the gargantuan task of ar
ranging all their diplomas. And the
task has grown from planning for
the 549 degrees awarded in 1921 to
the 2,414 awarded in 1952.
Miss Remele has also prepared
and supervised the registration

materials, which include an 18-
page booklet for each student.
