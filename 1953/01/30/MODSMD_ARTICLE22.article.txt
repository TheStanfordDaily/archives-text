# The 						Missing Quality
## 
### 
Seems like a silly guestion to ask after three
and a half years at Stanford, but in recent
months we've been wondering:
What is a university?
Is it a cloistered community . . . walling out
the lear and frenzy of modern life . . . provid
ing a quiet place for study and contemplation?
Yes, we suppose it's that. It's important that
at a university, one have some time for thought
and for research for information that aids that
thought. But to us a university should be some
thing more.
A university should be a vital place, alive
and intellectually stimulating. Ideas should
be allowed in, should be examined, devel
oped, sometimes transformed, then should
be transmitted to the rest of society.
By this definition, then, it is plain that Stan
ford is not a whole or complete university.
Our own dearly beloved Farm, so beautifully
cut off from the rush of city life, succeeds
beautifully in providing the contemplative part
ol university life.
But intellectual vitality is often missing.
We feel that the founders, in their eager
ness to keep Stanford calm and nonpartisan,
have shut out some of the much-needed in
tellectual stimulation. The limits on political
activity and on religious group meetings on
campus are examples.
There are limits, too, on the other half of the
process: the half that goes out. It would seem
ridiculous if a professor of chemistry were
forced by social pressure to remain quiet about
his theories. Yet when a professor has an idea
concerning the social, the economic, the poli
tical life of his country, he often causes a furor
when he expresses it. This goes for students,
100. Just let them attempt to try out their in
cipient political ideas on their own party
groups . . .

(We do not by this mean to imply that the
Administration of the University exercises
limits. In tact, it has been our cheering ex
perience during the past few months to learn
that where the top officials of Stanford are
concerned, the winds of freedom are still al
lowed to blow. The pressures against free
expression come, on the other hand, from
persons like parents and alumni.) .
Neither would it be fair to blame those
"above" or "outside" lor Stanford's failure to
live up to the full measure of intellectual ac
tivity we mean when we say "University."
Much of it is the students' own fault. It is so
easy to play bridge instead of reading the latest
news magazine ... so easy to sit back and
watch TV instead of arguing metaphysics.
Arid this is the area where the Daily can
help—a little anyway. And this is why we
have chosen the subject of what a university
should be for this, our final editorial of the
volume. •
Of course we realize that the purpose of the
Daily is not intellectual stimulation alone. A
campus paper is at once a bulletin board, a pub
licity medium, a form of entertainment.
, But it can be something more. And we feel,
Jim and Mary, that your jobs will hold greater
rewards if you make it something more. Print
significant national and international news,
take an occasional crack at interpreting it your
self, let a lot of different people express a lot
of different ideas in "Campus Opinion," see
that controversial campus subjects get a com
plete analysis.
In the months ahead you'll find yourselves in
a position where you'll receive much criticism,
little praise. But be thoughtful yourselves and
if you occasionally make someone else think,
then you will have succeeded.—Dorothy Dodge

activity and on religious group meetings on
campus are examples.
There are limits, too, on the other half of the
process: the half that goes out. It would seem
ridiculous if a professor of chemistry were
forced by social pressure to remain quiet about
his theories. Yet when a professor has an idea
concerning the social, the economic, the poli
tical life of his country, he often causes a furor
when he expresses it. This goes for students,
100. Just let them attempt to try out their in
cipient political ideas on their own party
groups . . .

(We do not by this mean to imply that the
Administration of the University exercises
limits. In tact, it has been our cheering ex
perience during the past few months to learn
that where the top officials of Stanford are
concerned, the winds of freedom are still al
lowed to blow. The pressures against free
expression come, on the other hand, from
persons like parents and alumni.) .
Neither would it be fair to blame those
"above" or "outside" lor Stanford's failure to
live up to the full measure of intellectual ac
tivity we mean when we say "University."
Much of it is the students' own fault. It is so
easy to play bridge instead of reading the latest
news magazine ... so easy to sit back and
watch TV instead of arguing metaphysics.
Arid this is the area where the Daily can
help—a little anyway. And this is why we
have chosen the subject of what a university
should be for this, our final editorial of the
volume. •
Of course we realize that the purpose of the
Daily is not intellectual stimulation alone. A

Jim and Mary, that your jobs will hold greater
rewards if you make it something more. Print
significant national and international news,

self, let a lot of different people express a lot
of different ideas in "Campus Opinion," see
that controversial campus subjects get a com
plete analysis.

Seems like a silly guestion to ask after three
and a half years at Stanford, but in recent
months we've been wondering:
What is a university?
Is it a cloistered community . . . walling out
the lear and frenzy of modern life . . . provid
ing a quiet place for study and contemplation?
Yes, we suppose it's that. It's important that
at a university, one have some time for thought
and for research for information that aids that
thought. But to us a university should be some
thing more.
A university should be a vital place, alive
and intellectually stimulating. Ideas should
be allowed in, should be examined, devel
oped, sometimes transformed, then should
be transmitted to the rest of society.
By this definition, then, it is plain that Stan
ford is not a whole or complete university.
Our own dearly beloved Farm, so beautifully
cut off from the rush of city life, succeeds
beautifully in providing the contemplative part
ol university life.
But intellectual vitality is often missing.
We feel that the founders, in their eager
ness to keep Stanford calm and nonpartisan,
have shut out some of the much-needed in
tellectual stimulation. The limits on political
activity and on religious group meetings on
campus are examples.
There are limits, too, on the other half of the
process: the half that goes out. It would seem
ridiculous if a professor of chemistry were
