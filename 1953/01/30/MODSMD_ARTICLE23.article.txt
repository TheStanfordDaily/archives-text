# An Open Letter to the Administration
## 
### 
As a student publication, we have tried this
year to be a medium for the expression of stu
dent problems. And these problems included
those where we felt that there had been unfair
action by the University adminstration. Gener
ally we have met with co-operation from Uni
versity personnel, but there are yet members of
the adminstration who do not recognize the
public relations value of a tolerant attitude to
ward student curiosity.
The administrative policy of Stanford is
based on the sound belief in the competence
and ability of student government of, by, and
for students. This is exemplified in the Honor
Code, student members on the Stanford Ath
lotic Board, the Council of Student Control com
posed of students to judge other students' mis
deeds, an unhampered student governmental
system, and unregulated student publications.
Unfortunately this basic policy is not ob
served consistently by all University per
sonnel. More than once in the last half-year
in the natural course of events there has been
a serious misunderstanding by students of an
administrative action. And as a result, in
almost every case, the immediate student
reaction was unfavorable to the administra
tion.
We are not here deciding whether the con
troversial actions were right or wrong since all
the facts of each case are not at our disposal.
However, we feel there is an important problem
for the administration in these acts.
Whether they involve a basketball trip or a
new procedure, the sum total of these adminis
strative actions too often leads to a diminished
student respect for the University. It is not an
uncommon feeling for uninformed students to
question acts of the adminstration just because
in the student's eyes the University has acted
unfairly.
This problem, we feel, is an important one
for the University administration to face. It
basically from the fact that the adminis

tration is in a position of authority. And we,
as students, are distrustful of unexplained
decisions of authority. The important point
to us is not what the action is, but rather why
it is taken. And we think we are entitled to
a reasonable explanation "Why."
Certainly, the University is not obligated to
explain why it takes certain actions, but ex
planations are important in maintaining good
student relations. Although many actions are,
to all extents and purposes, no business of stu
dents; we do, nevertheless, rightfully or no,
make it our business because we are interested
in what happens to our fellow students and to
our University. And we do not react favor
ably when we are given either no explanation
or an unsatisfactory explanation for what we
feel is an unfair action.
We therefore recommend to every mem
ber of the administration that they have an
outgoing attitude when their acts are ques
tioned. They should understand students'
guestions, consider them thoughtfully, and
remember that we can be placated with a
reasonable explanation. This is.not to say
that all members of the administration do not
have this tolerant attitude now; most of them
do, particularly in the top echelon. But there
are a few who are more curt and less tolerant.
We think that the students are rather impor
tant to this Universityâ€”both now and later. And
the impression the University makes now is
most important. So may we point out to the
administration that they do have room for im
provement of this attitude. x
The next time an administrative act is chal
lenged by any student we would appreciate
the administration's respect of the student's
curiosity, and its assistance in a more com
plete understanding by the student of the
problems inyolved. We feel that the results
of this attitude would be a credit to the ad
ministration and bring immeasurable benefit
to the University. Walt Menninger
