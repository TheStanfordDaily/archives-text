# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
I strolled into the Dally shack, Wagnered off the
last lew bars of Tristan and Isolde, ami slumped down
over my Underwood. Whereupon Jim Madison, who
takes over as new chief rooster of the Daily tomorrow,
came up and put his cigarette out in the palm of my
hand.
"Ouch," I allowed.
''Now, lissen, Grothe, I want you to be funny from

now on. I'm going to get tough,
see." <
Obviously, he was already
drunk with power.
"No more exposes on the Daily
or telling people how to pro
nounce your name."
"But," I objected, "I . . ."
"Shaddup," he offered, sticking
two stale copies of the Chappie
down my throat.
"Urp," I said, giving up my
end of (he conversation.

"No more nostalgia about the 'sweet clean air
on a sunny winter morn' and no more articles
telling how invincible Stanford athletic teams al
ways are."
"But . . ."
"Quiet," he offered, dropping a typewriter on my
foot.
"Ouch," I admitted. .
"I want you to be funny, see. Funny! Make 'em
laugh."
"But what is there to write about?" I threw in.
"General Mac Arthur faded away a long time ago, and
so has Marvin O. Adams and Donald E. Close. For

once, Rally Com isn't doing a bad job, and there are
no more bees at the Cellar."
"That does offer a problem," he mused. "But,"
he snapped, straightening up, "I still want you to be
funny, see. Do anything, but make 'em laugh."
"But what is there to be funny about? The
basketball team is about as successful as a bottle
of beer at a Fundamental Standard Com meeting;
my draft hoard is hotter for me than an SAK is for
a Madrono girl; and my courses are cooling me like
Norm Manoogian."
"Enough excuses!!" he shouted, picking up a frosh
tryoutee and throwing her at me.
I ducked.
"Now, wait a minute," I roared, standing up and
knocking over two typewriters and the head pho
tographer with a sweep of my hands. "You want me
to be'funny, eh? Okay, I'll be funny. I'll have them
lolling in the aisles in their eight o'clocks.
"I'll tell them once more about the cocker spaniel
up at one of the Row houses who was sitting next
to one of the brothers who had an upset stomach and
now they're calling him the bird dog?"
Madison looked at me like his professor just told
him he got the highest C plus in the class and
foamed, "No, no, stop!!"
"Or about the guy who says that everyone else
has a pen that can write under water but that he has
a typewriter that can write Underwood."
"No, no, no, stop, stop! ! ! ! Ha, ha , ha, ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha, gurgle, ha, ha! ! ! !"
Jim fell in a writhing heap on the floor, and I
ordered three reporters to carry him away.
I guess the Daily will have to get a new editor
now. Poor Jim, he had it in his day.
