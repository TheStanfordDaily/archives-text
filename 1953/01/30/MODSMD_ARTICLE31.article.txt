# Card Rugby Play Opens Tomorrow
## 
### 
Approximately 50 pairs of
cleats and shorts'and the Stan
ford men who fill them will get
their first test of the season to
morrow when Stanford's 1953
rugbq squads go into their first
competition of the season.
The Indian varsity, with more
depth at nearly every position than
it has enjoyed in recent years, runs
head-long into the always tough
Olympic Club of San Francisco on
the rugby field at 2:30 tomorrow
afternoon. In the second half of the
afternoon's double bill, the Palo
Alto Ramblers will furnish compe
tition for the Stanford JV's in a
contest scheduled to start at 4.
Competition in the "every prac
tice is a game in itself" type of
training advocated by Coach Pete
Kmetovic has been especially keen
so far this season. Kmetovic named
Marty Feldman, Derek Howard,
McMahon, and Vince Jones as !
those who have shown the most so j
far.
"J don't know too much about the j
Club this year," said Kmetovic yes
terday, "but with players like ex-
Indians Gordy Rice, Sarg Littlehule,
and Dave Brown and Cal's Carl â– 
Van Huet on tehir roster they I
should give us their usual rough j
game."
The Palo Alto Ramblers are, like- J
wise, an unknown quantity, al- !
though with similar clubs in the j
past years they have offered the J
varsity stiff competition.
