# Boxers Off to Battle Cal Poly
## 
### DICK KOENIGSBERG 
This morning, Stanford's boxing team journeys to San Luis Obispo
to take on Cal Poly. The boxers are after their first win of the season,
having dropped their opener to Cal, even while taking a majority of the
bouts. The 139 lb division, which was forfeited to Cal, has been filled by
Fred Dittmer. As yet. Coach Ray Lunny has found no one to replace
the injured Tony Wynn in the 166 lb division.
Lunny doesn't know too much about the capabilities of the Poly pugi
lists, but he is counting on the boxers to get their first win. He expects the
| 147 lb bout between Poly's Bettencourt and Jack Owens to be very close
and interesting. He also was very high on the performance of 133 lb Gary
Sievert against Cal's Ken Hansen, who held the P.C.C. champ to a very
j close split decision.
It will be very interesting to see how heavyweight Norm Manoogian
; fares in his second outing, after having knocked out his Cal opponent in
50 seconds of the first round.
