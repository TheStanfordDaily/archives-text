# Frosh Five Hosts Flashy Gaelbabes
## 
### RUSS WILKS 
The Stanford freshman basketball team, undefeated in nine
games, encounters what couHd be its roughest opposition of the
year when it meets the St. Mary's frosh Saturday afternoon at 2
in the Pavilion. Lincoln High of San Francisco will provide the
competition Friday afternoon at 3, also in the Pavilion.

St. Mary's comes to the Farm
with a very impressive record, as
have most of the Papooses' foes this
eason. However, the Gaels have
faced rougher opposition and are
undoubtedly one of the best teams
the frosh will play.
Well Balanced
St. Mary's has a well-balanced
first team and its offense isn't built
around any one player. All five
can fast break, shoot, and defend,
Bill Sanchez, 6 ft. 1 in., a good all
around player and high scorer, will
be at one forward along with 6-ft.
2-in. Mike Wadsworth. W a d swo, 'th
is the team's leading scorer with a
15-point average and is an excel
lent rebounder.
Ex - Fremont High ace Clarence
Crew, 6 ft .4 in., will work the pivot.
At guards will be Stan Stewart,
who played his high school ball at
Washington High in the City. Stew
art is the most consistent shot fr&m
the outside and a good scorer. Jer
ry Phillips, another Fremont High
boy, will be at the other guard.
Phillips is the only man under six
feet, but he is the last break leader
and a good driver.
Only One Game Lost
St. Mary's has lost only one ball
game and that was to the San Fran
cisco frosh by a slight margin. The
Papooses beat S.F. 51-48, but as
Clegg said, "Comparative scores
don't mean anything. The loss to
S.F. was early in the season and
the Gaels have improved a great
deal since then."
St. Mary's has defeated, among
others, Santa Clara frosh, San Jose
frosh, and Santa Rosa JV, which

' defeated the Braves.
[ Clegg isn't too much worried
112 iibout Lincoln, which is currently
going nowhere in the City League,
\ residing in seventh place. The
' Mustangs were mauled by Lowell

49-29, while the frosh beat Lowell
49-46, but again comparative scores
don't always hold up.
Papoose Lineup
Clegg will use Selleck, the top
floor man, who leads in scoring
with 133 points, at one guard and
captain-elect Ron Wagner, with 58
points, at the other guard. Gunnar
Christiansen, 84 points, or Bill
Flanders, 41 points, will start at
a forward along with Jerry Gustaf
son, 49 points, at the other forward.
Denny Boren, who has only tallied
30 points, will start at center as he
continues to hold down the starting
berth because of his good rebound
work.
