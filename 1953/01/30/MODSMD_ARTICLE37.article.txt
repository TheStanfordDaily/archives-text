# JV's After Tenth Scalp
## 
### 
Facing perhaps their most inex
perienced foe this season, the
Braves will be just right for an
upset when they meet an impotent
Hayward High five tomorrow at 4
in the Pavilion.
Playing out of their league, Hay
ward brings a crop of seniors who
will be out to produce a win over
a powerful Brave team which has
racked up nine wins in ten starts,
most of the victories coming against
junior college and service teams.
Coach George Lynn announced
the recovery of A 1 Talboy, who has
been out of action' for the last six
games. He will probably see action
in tomorrow's game.
The probable starting lineup as
announced by Lynn: Bob Ogorick
and Paul Johnson, forwards; Wayne
Culberson, center; Wayne Lockhart
and Jim Johnson or Jim Westphal,
guards.
