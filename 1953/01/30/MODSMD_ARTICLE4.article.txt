BKHLIN—The desire for freedom
brought more than 1,000 fugitives
from Communism into Berlin for
the 11th straight day today, raising
the January total to 22,792 persorts.
The flight to the West went on
unabated despite a dire picture of
life for the refugees as foretold to
day by all East German newspapers
in a bid to cut down the drain on
Communist Germany.
Those who ask for asylum in the
West will wind up in jail, the For
eign Legion, or perhaps brothels
for those eligible, the Red press
warned.
