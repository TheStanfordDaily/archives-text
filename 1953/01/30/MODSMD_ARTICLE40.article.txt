# Visiting Harvard Lecturer Impressed by California
## 
### DAVE BROWNWOOD 
"I feel appreciated by every
one here, official or unofficial."
Impressed by the "hospitality
and friendliness" of Stanford,
Professor in Humanities Ralph
Barton Perry, distinguished phil
osopher from Harvard Univer
sity, describes in this manner
his feelings toward the Farm.
Professor Perry is here for sev
eral weeks to deliver a series of
eight talks, including a public lec
ture. The first talk was given on
Jan. 21, and the others will continue
each Monday and Wednesday af
ternoon at 4:15 in the Women's
Clubhouse until Feb. 16. The lec
ture is scheduled for Feb. 13 in
Memorial Auditorium.
John W. Dodds, Director of Hu
manities Programming, originally
asked the professor to visit Stan
ford as a "floating resident at
large," and in this capacity to be
available for consultation to faculty
and students. The talks and lec
ture were added because it was felt
that they would reach more people.
Professor Perry's ideas for the
present series of talks came from
his ""Gilford Lectures," which he
gave in 1947 at Glasgow, Scot
land. Many of the principles
which the Harvard philosopher is
explaining here are incorporated
into a book to be published next
autumn, "Realms of Value."
The visiting lecturer classes him
self as "an Easterner whose second
love has always been California."
In previous years he has lectured or
taught for short periods at nearby
Mills College and Berkeley, as well
as in the southland at Pomona, Cal
Tech, and UCLA.
Special attractions which Califor
nia holds for him are children and
grandchildren in Mill Valley, Marin
County.
Although a Cambridge resident of
long standing, Professor Perry is an
admirer of California's "spacious
ness" as well as its hospitality.
"This spacious feeling is evi
denced everywhere in California,
not only in the scenery, but also
in the attitude of the people.
There is less social distinction here
than in the East, along wit'# a
feeling of casualncss and sponta
neity," he commented.
Recalling the beautiful scenery of
the state, and noting again the

"spacious" quality of it, he added
that possibly the lack of distinction
among groups here is because in
California one is "closer to original
nature."
His remaining five talks will de
scribe the methods used in the cul
tural sciences, those sciences which
"man makes," with special atten
tion placed on what the lecturer
calls the "normative method."
Through this method a social or
ganization is judged good or bad in
relation to its social function.
"Polity and Political Science"
on Monday is the next in the
series. In this talk, for example,
the "explanatory method" will be
used to describe how political
systems arose; the "technologi
cal," to describe the means by
which they can be created; and
the "normative," to describe their
values.
Following this, Professor Perry
will use much the same system to
consider other cultural sciences:
"Law and Jurisprudence," Wednes
day; "Art and Aesthetics," Feb. 9;

"Education: Formal and Informal,"
Feb. 11; and ''The Values of Reli
gion," Feb. 16.
The public lecture in Mem Aud
will be on the topic "What It Means
to Be Free."

and friendliness" of Stanford,
Professor in Humanities Ralph
Barton Perry, distinguished phil
osopher from Harvard Univer
sity, describes in this manner
his feelings toward the Farm.
Professor Perry is here for sev
eral weeks to deliver a series of
eight talks, including a public lec
ture. The first talk was given on
Jan. 21, and the others will continue
each Monday and Wednesday af
ternoon at 4:15 in the Women's
Clubhouse until Feb. 16. The lec
ture is scheduled for Feb. 13 in
Memorial Auditorium.
John W. Dodds, Director of Hu
manities Programming, originally
asked the professor to visit Stan
ford as a "floating resident at
large," and in this capacity to be
available for consultation to faculty
and students. The talks and lec
ture were added because it was felt
that they would reach more people.
Professor Perry's ideas for the
present series of talks came from
his ""Gilford Lectures," which he
gave in 1947 at Glasgow, Scot
land. Many of the principles
which the Harvard philosopher is
explaining here are incorporated
into a book to be published next
autumn, "Realms of Value."
The visiting lecturer classes him
self as "an Easterner whose second
love has always been California."
In previous years he has lectured or
taught for short periods at nearby
Mills College and Berkeley, as well
as in the southland at Pomona, Cal
Tech, and UCLA.
Special attractions which Califor
nia holds for him are children and
grandchildren in Mill Valley, Marin
County.
Although a Cambridge resident of
long standing, Professor Perry is an
admirer of California's "spacious
ness" as well as its hospitality.
"This spacious feeling is evi
denced everywhere in California,
not only in the scenery, but also
in the attitude of the people.
There is less social distinction here
than in the East, along wit'# a
feeling of casualncss and sponta
neity," he commented.
Recalling the beautiful scenery of
the state, and noting again the

"spacious" quality of it, he added
that possibly the lack of distinction
among groups here is because in
California one is "closer to original
nature."
His remaining five talks will de
scribe the methods used in the cul
tural sciences, those sciences which
"man makes," with special atten
tion placed on what the lecturer
calls the "normative method."
Through this method a social or
ganization is judged good or bad in
relation to its social function.
"Polity and Political Science"
on Monday is the next in the
series. In this talk, for example,
the "explanatory method" will be
used to describe how political
systems arose; the "technologi
cal," to describe the means by
which they can be created; and
the "normative," to describe their
values.
Following this, Professor Perry
will use much the same system to
consider other cultural sciences:
"Law and Jurisprudence," Wednes
day; "Art and Aesthetics," Feb. 9;

"Education: Formal and Informal,"
Feb. 11; and ''The Values of Reli
gion," Feb. 16.
The public lecture in Mem Aud
will be on the topic "What It Means
to Be Free."
