"Represents education
that continues,"
says GEORGE GALLUP
Founder of the American Institute of Public Opinion; formerly
Professor, Pulitzer School of Journalism, Colombia U.
"A serious weakness of the American
educational system is the missing link
between what we are taught in school and
what we learn after leaving school. The
Reader's Digest represents education that
continues. It arouses and satisfies keen
interest in the vital issues of the day
and in varied fields of lasting knowledge."

Look at the wide range of subjects in any issue—The
Reader's Digest is designed for the well-rounded individual
who cultivates interests far wider than the confines of any
particular field.
From the wealth of material that is published each month,
the editors select those outstanding articles no thoughtful
person would want to miss. Each article is condensed to
present the essentials clearly, yet preserve the full content
and flavor of the original.
The Reader's Digest offers a continuing liberal education
for millions of men and women with alert, open minds.
