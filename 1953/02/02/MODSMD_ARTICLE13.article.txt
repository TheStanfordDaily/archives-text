# Milstein's Violin Recital 'Flawless,' Says Critic
## 
### RON ROSEN 
It is not often that one en
counters both flawless tech
nique and profound interpre
tation in violinists today, or
for that matter, in musicians
in general.
These two attributes, however,
were in evidence at Nathan Mil
stein's violin recital in Memorial
Auditorium Saturday night.
Milstein, one of today's truly
great artists, seems to be one of
those violinists whose technique
comes as second nature, so that,
he is able to devote all of his en
ergies to interpreting. His under
standing and devotion are so com
plete that one recognizes a sub
mergence of self in the music.
One is never conscious of the
artist: one is conscious only of
the composer's music and inten
tions. For this reason, Milstein
is able to transcend the earthly
limits of the commonplace.
Opening with the "Chaconne"
by Vitali, Milstein instantly re
vealed his extraordinary gifts.
His intonation was impeccable, his
technique perfect, and his inter
pretation deep and searching. He
followed thus with another seven
teenth-century composer — Bach.
The unaccompanied Partitas

for violin are in many ways the
most difficult compositions ever
written for violin. They require
everything of a violinist.
Milstein's performance of the
"Prelude" and "Gavotte" from the
"Partita in E Major" was a high
point on the program, and left one
with the regret that he did not
choose to perform the whole Par
tita.
Brahms' "Sonata in D Minor,"
with its lullaby-like Adagio, was
given a very spacious and pro
found reading by both Milstein
and his fine accompanist, Harry
Kaufman.
The popular "Concerto in A
Minor" by Glazounoff was the
major offering on the second half
of the recital, and, as always,
brought the house down with its
rapid (ire pizzicati and rhapsodic
melodies.
The "Nigun" by Bloch again
made one wish that Milstein
would have included the whole
"Baal Shem Suite" from which
it was taken. This music seems
to gather more strength and
character with each hearing,
and was given a powerful and
dramatic reading.
"From My Homeland" by Smet
ana filled out this recital — one
that will he remembered here for
a long time.
