# U.S. Press Caters to Reds, Opinion Authority Claims
## 
### HADLEY ROFF 
The charge that the American press is playing footsie with Stalin
and his Kremlin compatriots was leveled by George Catlin, noted
authority on public opinion, Friday night when he addressed the
Stanford chapter of Phi Sigma Alpha, political science honorary,
at L'Omelette.
Catlin, now a visiting professor of political science at the Uni-

versity of California, declared that
American newspaper men are deal
ing directly into the hands of the
propagandists of the Soviet Union
by giving Red claims wide interna
tional circulation.
He charged that the three chief
news agencies in the United States
have put profit above country and
insist on catering to Soviet propa
gandists in order to sell their serv
ices to newspapers behind the Iron
Curtain.
He said:
"Can he (President Dwight Ei
senhower) ask these American citi
zens who own and control the press
associations to put their country
and its cause above all the other 75
countries, including the Soviet and
its satellites, who are clients of the
American press associations?"
He said that many "I - bombs"
(idea bombs) have been detonated
of late in the American press by
clever, unscrupulous Red propa
gandists. Most flagrant example of
this, according to the UC professor,
was Stalin's recent peace declara
tion solicited by the New York
Times and published in that paper
on Christmas Day under large
headlines.
Then the press critic asked, "Do

â™¦
you, does anyone understand . . .
why the American press helped Mr.
Stalin and comforted the Kremlin?"
Part of the answer, according to
the greying professor, lies with the
profit motive. Another part rests
with the newspaper's unquenchable
demand lor scoops, startling stories
that can be flared across page one.
Then, in a veiled charge, he ac
cused the press of trying to appease
both the Russans and the Ameri
cans in the cold war. He said the
press "wanted to eat its cake and
have it too" by placating both Sta
lin and Eisenhower.
Though his attack on the press
was fairly specific, his plarus for
correcting the alleged ills were less
clear. He claimed that the press
and the government should co-op
erate in presenting counter propa
ganda to Soviet claims. This co-op
eration, he declared in one part of
his speech, should be unforced.
But in another part, quoting from
an article lie had written for the
Public Opinion Quarterly, he said:
"It. is a government's business to
govern and firmly to meet propa
ganda by propaganda, but not to
terrorize the citizens from free dis
cussion."
