# Church Plans To Increase Its Activities
## 
### 
The Memorial Church Committee
plans to expand its activities this
quarter with the aim of making the
50-year-old church "the spiritual
center of the campus."
The Sunday Afternoon Club,
sponsored by the committee, meets
every Sunday at 4 p.m. in Bowman
Alumni House to discuss pertinent
religious topics, and is open to all
students.
At yesterday's meeting the two
main problems now before Mem
Church Com were discussed: cam
pus - wide representation on the
committee ami investigation of the
sermon problem.
Excom now lias two representa
tives on the committee, i ; aiming
for even more student body repre
sent.at.ion. This may be achieved
by getting representatives from liv
ing group areas. Chaplain Minto
hopes some clay to rc! a "church
agent" from every residence.
Herb Long, chairman of Mem
Church Com, told the club that the
visiting preachers are often "so
conscious of the intellectual atmos
phere that they gear their sermons
to the faculty rather than the stu
dents."
To combat "pot luck" in sermon
topics and gain continuity, a com
mittee has been set up to suggest
a general theme for each quarter.
This theme would be flexible for
the visiting preachers.
Ellie Myers suggested having a
minister for a longer time than one
Sunday, so he would "feel closer"
to the campus religious problems.
Dick Weismann said that living
groups should be consulted and
their criticisms obtained in the
"work of tying the church in better
with the student life of the Uni
versity."
