# Cards Beaten by Broncs; Bounce Back, Nip Gaels
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
Stanford s run-shoot run finally broke the spell Satur
day night as they skimmod by St. Mary's 66 to 65, but not until
they extended their loosing streak to six by dropping a tough
i one to Santa Clara, 81-71. in Friday night's tilt.
Against Santa Clara, the Cards started off hotter than a two-

buck pistol, only to find their op
ponents equally torrid. At the end
of the half, the combination track
meet and hoop game was all tied up,
S 40 all.
And they didn't stop there. With
the game tied 20 times in the eve
ning, they finally moved it up to
60 all. From here, the Broncs Ken
Sears dunked two and proceeded to
lead his team to the win. It was
close as a hare's whisker up to the
last minute, when the fouling In
dians let the independents forge
ahead.
High point man for the evening
was Sears with 24, while Stanford's
Russ Lawler, playing the best game
of his career, tanked 21. George
Zaninovich had 16 and Ron Tomsic
scored 15.
In Saturday's tilt, an inspired first
half club, namely St. Mary's, was
topped by an inspired third quarter
team, namely Stanford in a game
that went from ridiciulous to riot
j ous.
The Cards got off to a bad start,
and couldn't find the basket until
the very end of the first quarter,
when they closed it up to 24 to 20.
After the tipoff for the second
quarter, the Gael's Bill Baglpy
started hitting everything he could
get his hands on, tanking eight points
to drive his team out to a 38-29 lead.
But this was all, and the Stanfords
plopped in eight points to move up
to within two points at the half, 37
to 39.
The Gaels moved out fast in the
third period, hut suddenly hit a
draught as Zaninovich, Don De-
Long, and Oleg Suzdaleff teamed
up to go wild and lead the Cards
on to 60 to 52 lead with only five
minutes left to go in the game.
Then the Gaels got hot, and wo
might add comical, as they moved
to close up the gap. With two min
utes to play, Suds, drove the length
of the court for two to widen the
gap, 64 to 61, getting fouled in the
