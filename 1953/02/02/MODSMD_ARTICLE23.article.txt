# The

### 
Hesitantly at first, and then with growing
confidence, we take to the typewriter keys for
the opening editorial of Volume 123.
As this is generally the time to get things
a theoretically ready, but untried fledgling
trying his growing wings for the first time in
actual flight.
As this is generally the time to get things
straight between the readership of the Daily
and its editorial staff, this little ditty is intended
to accomplish just that.
As far as news play is concerned we intend
to continue the balance between volume of
campus news and volume of general news at
about the same point it has been throughout
the past volume.
Within this framework we will try to "cover
the campus like a tent," in the words of the new
managing editor. That is, without giving more
space we will attempt to get in more facts,
more news, more color—all of it more con
cisely and accurately written.
In doing this, the Daily is necessarily limit
ed by the size of its staff. Presently, we have
the best manned staff we've had in the past
two years. But we need still more reporters,
and will appreciate any interested people
who drop around this shack looking for a job.
We also ask the co-operation of the campus
in giving us news tips. If anyone has a moan,
it anyone hears a rumor, give us a ring and
we'll chase down the facts—and, it there's
news in it, we'll print the story.
In the realm of general news, we do not at

tempt to compete with the city newspapers—
they're having a sufficiently difficuft time com
peting with themselves, and besides that is not
the Daily's province. Nevertheless we believe
that many of the Daily's readers don't have the
time or opportunity to digest a city news sheet.
The Daily will therefore attempt to print a gen
eral resume of the general news picture.
Editorially, Volume 123 of the Daily promises
to be an active one. There are many phases of
campus life worth comment. Editorials on po
litical subjects are also often timely. In this
realm we are admittedly a Republican, al
though of the William Allen White school. As
in the past, all unsigned editorials will have
been written by the editor, all others by the
respective signees of the editorial board.
The Daily realizes its role as an arena for
airing campus ideas and gripes. We will con
tinue to welcome and encourage numerous
letters-to the editor.
The editorship will also welcome anyone
who wishes to talk to any of its members per
sonally. The editor will be in his office every
morning from 11 to 12 and will also be avail
able in the afternoon. The managing editor
will be here at least from 3 to 4 in the afternoon,
and the staff editor will generally be at the
Shack after three.
So, like a football ref blowing his whistle
for the kickoff, we hereby initiate the volume
and hope that the camplis will come to read,
rely on, and respect the Daily to an ever greater
extent than before.
