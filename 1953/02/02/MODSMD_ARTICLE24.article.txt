# Thoughts to Build On
## 
### 
Now is the time for all good students to
come to their own aid with some clear, con
centrated thinking about the proposed Tresid
der Memorial Union.
The ASSU Union Planning Committee, which
is starting today a five week fact-finding cam
paign to determine the needs in a new union,
must have a full and complete airing of stu
dent opinion. For the basis of final Union plans
will be student needs as presented by students.
There are numerous possible facilities which
could be included in a new union—conference
rooms, TV lounges, a coffee shop, mimeograph
machinery, and countless others.
But which of these possibilities are pipe
dreams, which are mere novelties, and which
will actually serve a useful function on campus
is what the Planning Committee must deter
mine.
This will reguire great effort on the part of

the committee and great co-operation on the
part of the student body. The committee must
contact all students to get a complete sound
ing of ideas. And the students must consider
not only their own desires, but also the needs
of students to come. For the Union will be a
part of the campus, involving a
large expenditure of money. We must consider
that the installations will be wasted if'they en
joy a popularity for six months or so, and then
remain unusued for the remainder of the
Union's life.
With the foregoing in mind, we ask everyone
to read with consideration the articles pre
sented in today's JOaily and any in future is
sues, to listen thoughtfully to the presentations
made by the speaking teams of the Union Plan
ning Committee, to complete the guestion
naires that are distributed, and to offer construc
tive ideas at the open hearings to be conducted.
