### DICK MANSFIELD 
Fairchild Cody was the greatest basketball player
Stanford had. You won't find bis name in the school's
record books, because he never played varsity or
jayvee ball. Cody was better than varsity ball play
ers, who have to be ablo to wear a lei gracefully, or
jayvee ball players, who have to run up enormous
scores game after game against local Junior College
competition. Cody was super-versatile, for Cody
played intramural ball.

Weeknights, out at the Encina
gym and the pavilion, the aggre
gations of lota Psi, Village Shanty
A, such ambiguous aggregations
as Icecubes I or Ãœbangis, and
Encina Grotto vie for the intra
mural basketball championship.
It is he-man stuff, that intramural
ball. They hire small children and
fanatics as referees.
Substitution is unlimited, and
six or seven eager Brothers have

been known to pound the hardwood for lota Psi at one
and the same time. On this occasion, lota's opponent
was the Stern Wheelers, who had run up an 89 to 7
margin at hall and were not prone to protest. But
strange things have been done in the intramural bas
ketball league.
Some of the strangest were done by Fairchild Cody
of Seven Gobbles. Cody couldn't run, couldn't jump,
coujdn't shoot, couldn't play defense. But he regularly
scored 30 points a game. This is why Seven Gobbles
always won the intramural trophy when Cody was in
school. Tlie other six Gobbles were classified as
"Cody's teammates." Every time that Seven Gobbles
played, the final score was 30 to nothing.

Seven Gobbles had a gigantic center named Ogorski.
Ogorski was seven feet tall. Cody would pass the ball
to Ogorski, and Ogorski woidd fake a shot. Ogorski
couldn't have hit the wall with a scatter gun. but when
he faked a shot, the other team's center invariably
got all in a dither and jumped him. Five times this
would happen and out would go the other team's pivot
man on fouls. Each time, Ogorski would miss his foul
shot and Cody would put in the rebound. Three op
posing pivot men equalled fifteen rebound shots by
Cody equalled the ball game. If the other team didn't
have three pivot men, Cody didn't, get his thirty points,
but Seven Gobbles won by forfeit.
And how did Cody get rebounds if he couldn't jump?
Cody had the intramural system cold. Seveh Gobbles
had a watch-charm-type guard with a high, squeaky
voice. As each foul shot was in the air, this guard
would give a horrid cry as of pain. The referee would
turn to see the sight, and as the referee's back was
turned, Cody, intramural expert, would whip a dirk
out of his sock and merely hijack the ball. No op
ponent dared breathe a word of this, for Cody always
had his dirk.
And the superlative defensive play of Seven Gobbles,
which held the opponents scoreless, was also centered
around Cody. Cody called signals on a tight five-()-()
football-type defense formed at tjie middle line. Any
one foolish enough to drive through this defense got
the dirk. Most teams just worked it around in back
court until time ran out, and then Cody would pass
it in to Ogorski and set up another rebound. '
And it was small wonder that on the intramural
all-star team, Seven Gobbles placed four men. At
guard, the watch-charm guard. At center, Ogorski.
At one forward, Cody. And at the other forward,
Cody's dirk.
