What is the "New Union?"
It is a student union, proposed
as a memorial to Dr. Donald W.
Tresidder, which will be estab
lished as tire center of student
life and activities on campus.
What will be offered by the Tres
idder Union?
The Student , Union Planning
Committee is preparing to conduct
an extensive opinion survey this
quarter among the (5,737 members
of the student body to answer that
question.
Suggestions to the committee have
included:
Bowling alley, volleyball, music
listening r o o m , photographers'
dark room, ballroom, small audi
torium, c a r d r o o m s, study,
lounges, information center, drug
store, restauhant, snack bar, stu
dent organization offices, trophy
louiige, and mimeograph facili
ties.
In the opinion poll students will
be able to indicate their preferences
by filling out the questionnaires
which will be distributed by the
committee. Jack Fraser, chairman
oi the planning committee, has em

phasized that "majority opinion of
the students will be a deciding fac
tor in planning the union."
Fraser, who heads the third
committee since the war to deal
with plans for construction, says
that a "recreational" rather than
a "lounge-type" student union is
comparatively new among West
ern universities, hut that the
Universities of Oregon and Wash
ington have built their new un
ions as recreational centers.
Washington's union, "The Hub,"
features extensive but varied din
ing facilities for student and faculty
groups and a ballroom, several
lounges, student organization of
fices, and an outdoor lounge-patio.
(See picture.)
The Erb Memorial Student Union
at Oregon, "a dream come true after
25 years," has these features as well
as music and art lounges, extensive
recreational facilities, a library,
barber shop, and dining areas.
"Stanford's Tresidder Union
will probably follow the general
plan established by the two

northern colleges, but student
opinion will determine what fa
cilities are to be included," the
chairman of the planning com
mittee says.
Planning recreational unions is
an increasing activity for Califor
nians; officials of the University of
California at both Berkeley and
Los Angeles are planning the con
struction of new student unions
which will include large audito
riums. Cal's plans call for the ex
penditure of nine million dollars for
construction.
A TV lounge has recently be
come part of the student union
at USC. The Trojans are among
the first to initiate such a project,
and proclaim that (he popularity
of the lounge has made it a huge
success.
If the demand is great enough,
Stanford's Tresidder Union will
supply the same facility.

Commission says that this feature is a possibility in the new Tresidder Union, if student opinion
calls for it.

The Erb Memorial Student Union
at Oregon, "a dream come true after
25 years," has these features as well
as music and art lounges, extensive
recreational facilities, a library,
barber shop, and dining areas.
"Stanford's Tresidder Union
will probably follow the general
plan established by the two

northern colleges, but student
opinion will determine what fa
cilities are to be included," the
chairman of the planning com
mittee says.
Planning recreational unions is
an increasing activity for Califor
nians; officials of the University of
California at both Berkeley and
Los Angeles are planning the con
struction of new student unions
which will include large audito
riums. Cal's plans call for the ex
penditure of nine million dollars for
construction.
A TV lounge has recently be
come part of the student union
at USC. The Trojans are among
the first to initiate such a project,
and proclaim that (he popularity
of the lounge has made it a huge
success.
If the demand is great enough,
Stanford's Tresidder Union will
supply the same facility.

What is the "New Union?"
It is a student union, proposed
as a memorial to Dr. Donald W.
Tresidder, which will be estab
lished as tire center of student
life and activities on campus.

idder Union?
The Student , Union Planning
Committee is preparing to conduct
an extensive opinion survey this
quarter among the (5,737 members
of the student body to answer that
question.
Suggestions to the committee have
included:
Bowling alley, volleyball, music
listening r o o m , photographers'
dark room, ballroom, small audi
torium, c a r d r o o m s, study,
lounges, information center, drug
store, restauhant, snack bar, stu
dent organization offices, trophy
louiige, and mimeograph facili
ties.
In the opinion poll students will
be able to indicate their preferences
by filling out the questionnaires
which will be distributed by the
committee. Jack Fraser, chairman
oi the planning committee, has em

phasized that "majority opinion of
the students will be a deciding fac
tor in planning the union."
Fraser, who heads the third
committee since the war to deal
with plans for construction, says
that a "recreational" rather than
a "lounge-type" student union is
comparatively new among West
ern universities, hut that the
Universities of Oregon and Wash
ington have built their new un
ions as recreational centers.
Washington's union, "The Hub,"
features extensive but varied din
ing facilities for student and faculty
groups and a ballroom, several
