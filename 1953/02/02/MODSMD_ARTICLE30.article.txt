# Poll Begins Today
## Students Asked How to Spend Million-Dollar Tresidder Fund 
### ALICE ROBB 
It's token five yeais, but the
proposed Donald Tresidder Me
morial Union is finally on the
way.
The University has at last col
lected enough money to begin
planning its new student activi
ties center.
And live weeks and (1,000 question
naires from now Excom's Union Plan
ning Committee and the University's
Planning Oflice will be able to sit
down and begin drafting specific
plans for the building.
A live-week campaign to decide
what facilities the student body wants
in its new Union is getting under way
tonight, as student speaking teams
appear at house meetings to present
the facts and ask loi student opinion.
The speaking teams will cover
Monday night house meetings in all
the living groups in the next four
wceks. Six thousand questionnaires
will be distributed by the speakers
asking specifically : "Would you use
such-and-such a facility?"
Open hearings will be held the fifth
week of the campaign, from March
3 to 7, when individual students and
members of the faculty and adminis
tration may present and discuss
their ideas with the Union Planning
Comtnittee.
The committee's report to the Uni
versity Planning Office will be based
on results of these three opinion
gathering mechanisms.
Little is known right now about
the actual form of (he building. Its
design will depend upon the func
tions (he students decide to include
in it.
Eldridge T. Spencer, head of the
University's Planning Oflice, says that
if Stanford tradition is followed, the
building will probably have a tile
roof and an open or garden-type plan.
It will probably be built of masonry,
he said, and be not over two or three
stories high.
The proposed Union is now enter
ing the study and planning stage,

which will take about three months.
Alter the basic plans are furnished,
l'roni six to ten months will be re
quired to yet them into the blueprint
.stage. Then it will take from 12 to 18
months to build the Union.
'l'he building will probably be com
pleted from 21 to 31 months from now.
The Tresidder Union Fund was
established as a memorial to Dr.
Donald Tresidder, Stanford's fourth
president, following his death in
If! 48. A student activities center
seemed particularly fitting for Dr.
Tresidder, because he was a firm

believer in developing student so
cial interests, and was known for
opening his own lionie to student
use.
Mrs. Tresidder asked that no large
scale public lund-raising campaign
be held. But despite the lack of a
concentrated donation program, near
ly $600,000 has already been collected.
This money is specifically earmarked
for the Union Fund, and can be used
for no other project. «-
Money for the fund came from stu
dent lees, Stanford Union profits,
gifts and income on invested funds.
One dollar of each student's tuition
each quarter now goes into the Tres
idder Union Fund. (In other years
this "building dollar" has gone to
buy the Basketball Pavilion and the
Memorial Auditorium.)
Gifts include donations from Mrs.
Tresidder, the University trustees,
various student organizations, and
other individual donors.
Union profits come from the Cel
lar, the public dining hall, the En
cina Store, and similar operations.
Student Manager Steve Horn be
lieves that the fund can count on an
additional income of from $90,000 to
$100,000 a year from student fees.
Union profits, and interest on in
vested fdnds. However, he said, there
will be no special campaign for do
nations.

As soon as the floor plan has
been decided, individual donors
may contribute gilts for specific
facilities, Horn said. He also em
phasized that surplus funds froNi i
student organizations and class
gifts may be donated either for the
project in general or for specific
facilities.
The present Committee, set up by
Excom last year, has much the same
j purpose as a previous committee, 1
J which tried in 1940 to discover stu
| dent opinion on the proposed build
ing-
Moth committees worked pri
marily to determine methods for
polling student opinion oil the new
Union, when planning would lie
1 ready to begin.
*lhe s< c..nd • urvey is necessary
I now, partially because the first com
! mittee used less intensive methods of
j .surveying student opinion, and par-
J tially because opinions may have
j changed considerably since I}J4!J.

Nini Moore, Dianne Goldman, Joan
Coldren, Susan Raymond, Mary
Strickland, Laude NefT, Maxine
