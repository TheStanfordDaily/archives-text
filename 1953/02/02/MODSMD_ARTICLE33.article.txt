# Central Site Is Chosen
## 
### 
The site chosen and approved lor
the proposed Tre-idder Union is
located directly south ol the exist
i ing Post Office.
According to Eldridge T. Spencer,
director of University planning, this
I site wa.s selected because il i â–  close
! to tiie existing units of the tmlcnt
activity center (Women". I'luh
| house, Nitery, Union, and 15<,ok
store).
The overall plan calls for a large
open mall, or square, over the area
which is now occupied by the I'ost
Office, with the new Union on the
south side and the Women's Club
house on the north. The new Post
Office and the enlarged Bookstore
will be on the east side ol T-asuen,
lacing the present Union.
The walk between Main Quad
and the Library will be continued
southward to the propo ed mall.
The road now running between
! the Post Office and Quad will be
I closed off, except to fire engines.
Students will.reach the buildings in
th(j area by driving in from an
outer road circling behind the
Bookstore and the Union, and
parking near the building they wish
to go to.


IT'S ON THE MAP
The Tresidder Memorial
Union will be located
across the street from
where the post office is
now. Other tentative plans
include an addition to the
< a
bookstore and a new post
office. Roads now running
in front of the bookstore
and the fiie department
will probably br blocked
to traffic.
