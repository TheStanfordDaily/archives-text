Last Friday night Stanford's box
ing team journeyed to San Luis
Obispo and absorbed a 6V2 -
beating at the hands of Cal Poly.
Lone bright star in the otherwise
dismal evening was reliable Bob
Baldocchi, who kayoed his oppo
nent, Ted Trompter, in the third
round of their 177-lb. bout.
Gary Sievert, 133 - pounder, put
on a good showing in his bout, but
was forced to settle for a draw with
Poly's Graf Shintaku, thus picking
up Stanford's other half-point.
Big surprise of the evening was
the knocking out of Norm Manoo
gian by Jack Shaw in the second
round. Coach Ray Lunny says that
Shaw is one of the best heavy
weights he has seen in a long time,
and that he ought to take the PCC
title in his division.
The Indians had to forfeit one
more match than they expected., as
155-lb. Eric Hansen came up with a
bad appendix on the morning of the
fight.
