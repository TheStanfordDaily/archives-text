# Papooses Beat Washington And St. Mary's; Remain Undefeated
## 
### RUSS WILKS 
Proving their ability to come from behind, the Stanford fresh
men got over a big hurdle toward an unbeaten season as they
defeated the St. Mary's frosh 61-55 Saturday afternoon in the
Pavilion. Friday afternoon the Papooses encountered no diffi
culty in disposing of Lincoln High, 63-25.
In winning their eleventh straight game of the season, the frosh

didn't have the game under control
until Ron Wagner sank two foul
shots to give Stanford a 59-55 lead
with 25 seconds left in the game.
The rebounding of the Gaelbabes
in the first half proved to be too
much for Dick Clegg's forces as
they walked off the court behind
by five points, 29-24.
However, in the second half, a
full court press and the lebound
work of Bill Flanders and Denny
Boren equalized the first-half job
by St. Mary's Mike Wadsworth,
Stan Stewart, and Bill Sanchez. A
big factor in the win was that San
chez sprained his ankle late in the
second quarter and didn't return
to the game and that Wadsworth
piled up four fouls early in the
third quarter and sat out most of
the second half.
Good Offensive Work
This, combined with the offensive
work of Gunnar Christiansen,
George .Selleck, and Flanders,
turned the tide of battle.
Christiansen, in scoring nine

points, tallied seven in the last
quarter and scored five in a row at
the start of the quarter, which car
ried the frosh to a 49-46 lead.
The Gaels never tied or recaptured
the lead again.
