# Rugby Game Puzzles All: Draws 'No Contest' Ruling
## 
### JACK RANNELS 
Nobody would ever believe you
if you told them that 30 men played
a game of competitive football for
80 minutes, and yet when the game
was over nobody knew what the
score of the game actually was.
What's more unbelievable is that
nobody is quite sure yet.
As strange as it may sound, that
is exactly what happened when the
Stanford Indians and the San Fran-

Cisco Olympic Club rugby teams
met Saturday in one of the wildest
scoring duels to be played in the
Bay Area in many a moon.
With less than two minutes to go
in the contest, freshman Dorsey
Atkinson, just about the movingest
man on the turf all afternoon,
scorei on a penalty kick to give the
Indian ruggers a seemingly safe 25
to 23 lead. And so it was until mere
seconds before the end of the game.
Then it happened. With seconds
to go, the Clubbers worked the ball
down to within yards of the Stan
ford goal and referee Bob Baxter
called for a scrum. Eight men from
each side put their heads together
and grunted and groaned amid the
cries of "heel, heel" by teammates.

Baxter blew his whistle signifying
the end of the game and 1(5 bodies
slumped to the ground in one Ijeap.
The ball was somewhere under
neath. Limb by limb, Baxter picked
the heap apart until he found that
Carl Van Heuit, former Cal safety
man, was clutching the ball inches
over the goal. For reasons known
only by Baxter, he ruled that Van
Heuit had not scored a try (touch
down) and the game was ended,
Stanford a 23-25 victor.
A rhubarb followed during which
many of the Stanford varsity start
ed for the showers and the JV's
took the field in preparation for the
next game. To settle the argument
Baxter called back the Stanfords
and another scrum was ordered.
When it turned out to be no more
decisive than the game-ending one,
and with more spectators than
players on the field, Baxter decided
to give the whole'deal up and called
the game "no contest." And so, no
contest it was.
The score? 0-0? 23-23? 1001-
1001? Who knows? No one seemed
too much disappointed, though, as
both players and spectators went
away with smiles on their faces.
Among the happiest were frosh
Atkinson and grad student Vince
Jones. Atkinson, a freshman foot
baller in his rugby debut, scored 14
points for the victors, or losers, or
whatever Stanford was. His two
first-half tries, along with those by
Fletcher Metten and A 1 Kirkland
and his successful conversion, gave
Stanford a 14-6 half-time lead. Ron
Cook, on a darting 15-yard run
topping off a multilateraling rush
by his teammates, brought the score
to 17-11 in the second half and the
ensuing conversion made 19 -11,
Stanford.
From there on in it was OC all
the way. First 14-19. Then 17-19,
17-22 (three points for Stanford on
a penalty kick by Atkinson), 20-22,
23-22, 23-25, and ???
Jones, though playing in the
scrum (comparable to playing in
the middle of the line in football),
managed to grab the ball and break
through the San Franciscans for
two long runs and several driving
shorter ohes. Others who stood out
for the locals were Cook, Mueller,
McMahon, and, of course, the aging
but still lively Marty Feldman, the
team leader.
