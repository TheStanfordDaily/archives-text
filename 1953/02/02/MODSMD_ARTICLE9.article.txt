# STATE OF THE UNION
## Ike May Permit Attack on China 
### 
WASHINGTON, I eb. I (UP)—President Eisenhower delivers
a State of the Union message to Congress tomorrow which is ex
pected to free Chiang Kai-shek for attacks on Red China in the
first move of his "deeds not words" Korean war policy.
The eagerly-awaited message, to be delivered personally by
♦ the President to a joint session of

the House and. Senate at 9:30 a.m.
PST, also will spell out the new
Republican administration's fiscal
and social policies ior the coming
year. The speech will be broadcast
and televised by major networks.
Interest centered on the Presi
dent's reported plan to free Chi-
I nese Nationalist troops on For
mosa for hit - ami - run raids
against the Chinese Communist
mainland. It would be aimed at
diverting some Red Chinese
! troops from Korea.
Since June 10, 1950, the U.S. Sev
enth Fleet, under orders from for
mer President Truman, has pre
vented the Chinese Communists
from invading Formosa and, at
least in part, barred Nationalist
raids against the mainland.
Under Mr. Eisenhower's reported
plan, the fleet would continue to
protect Formosa from Red attack
but would permit the Nationalists
to strike at Red China. Informed
sources said the attacks would be
limited and that there would be
nothing in the way of a major in
vasion, at least in the near future.
In addition, the President is ex
pected to call for extension of the
Social Security system, greater
conservation efforts, and continu
ation of present farm policies
until bis administration has a
chance to review and recommend
any changes deemed desirable.
A tip-ofT to the overall Eisen
hower program was provided re
cently by Presidential Assistant
Sherman Adams. He said the new
administration would move to the
"left" on social and welfare pro
grams and to the "right" on such
things as government spending and
' taxes.
Taft, who as Senate Republican
leader will have a major role in
deciding the late of Mr. Eisenhow
er's legislative program, said Con
gress is ready to start work on it
almost immediately after hearing
the State of the Union message.
