# Bradley Discounts War Risk In Ike's New Formosa Policy
## Full invasion Is 'Improbable' Now 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 (UP)
—Gen. Omar N. Bradley, chair
man of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said tonight he does not
think President Eisenhower's
decision to release Chinese Na
tionalist forces will involve
"much greater" risk of war with
Red China.
He said there is danger' of "shoot
ing" between American naval ships
and Chinese Communist vessels if
the Nationalists attack the main
land but added that this danger has
"always been present" since the
U.S. Seventh Fleet was assigned to
neutralize Formosa.
Bradley added that Chinese Na
tionalist raids on the mainland
"should have the effect" of divert
ing some Red Chinese troops from
the Korean war to protect the coast
opposite Formosa, island bastion of
Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists.
Appearing on the radio program
"Reporters Roundup," Bradley
called it "questionable" whether
the Nationalists will be able to at
tack the mainland "in the immedi
ate future." Asked whether such
raids, when made, would divert "a
certain number" of Fed Chinese
troops from action in Korea, his
answer was yes.
Bradley said the new policy does
not "necessarily" mean this coun
try must change its present policy
of limited aid to Chiang, but added
that Chiang would not be able to
stage large-scale raids without in
creased American aid.
Asked whether the United
States would "bail out" Chiang's
forces if they launch a beachhead
in China and get in trouble,
Bradley rpelied:
Bradley replied:
"This is a political decision and
He said that personally he "would
hate to se us get too much of our
military strength tied up in China
and that would certainly be getting
a lot of it tied up in China and on
the mainland of China."
Asked whether Nationalist raids
might involve U.S. naval vessels in
a "shooting operation" with Chi
nese Communist ships, Bradley
said:
"Yes, of course, that danger has
always been present since we first
assigned the Seventh Fleet the
task of protecting Formosa. We
have always had the chance that
it might result in a shooting war
between the neighbor forces of
Communist China and ourselves."
He added there is always the
calculated risk" of such a war,
adding:
"But. I do not see much greater
risk with this changc the President
has just made over what has been
in effect the last couple of years."

calculated risk" of such a war,
adding:
"But. I do not see much greater
risk with this changc the President
has just made over what has been
in effect the last couple of years."
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 (UP)
—Gen. Omar N. Bradley, chair
man of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said tonight he does not
think President Eisenhower's
decision to release Chinese Na
tionalist forces will involve
"much greater" risk of war with
Red China.
He said there is danger' of "shoot
ing" between American naval ships
and Chinese Communist vessels if
the Nationalists attack the main
land but added that this danger has
"always been present" since the
U.S. Seventh Fleet was assigned to
neutralize Formosa.
Bradley added that Chinese Na
tionalist raids on the mainland
"should have the effect" of divert
ing some Red Chinese troops from
the Korean war to protect the coast
opposite Formosa, island bastion of
Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists.
Appearing on the radio program
"Reporters Roundup," Bradley
called it "questionable" whether
the Nationalists will be able to at
tack the mainland "in the immedi
ate future." Asked whether such
raids, when made, would divert "a
certain number" of Fed Chinese
troops from action in Korea, his
answer was yes.
Bradley said the new policy does
not "necessarily" mean this coun
try must change its present policy
of limited aid to Chiang, but added
that Chiang would not be able to
stage large-scale raids without in
creased American aid.
Asked whether the United
States would "bail out" Chiang's
forces if they launch a beachhead
in China and get in trouble,
Bradley rpelied:
Bradley replied:
"This is a political decision and
He said that personally he "would
hate to se us get too much of our
military strength tied up in China
and that would certainly be getting
a lot of it tied up in China and on
the mainland of China."
Asked whether Nationalist raids
might involve U.S. naval vessels in
a "shooting operation" with Chi
nese Communist ships, Bradley
said:
"Yes, of course, that danger has
always been present since we first
assigned the Seventh Fleet the
task of protecting Formosa. We
have always had the chance that
it might result in a shooting war
between the neighbor forces of
Communist China and ourselves."
He added there is always the
calculated risk" of such a war,
adding:
"But. I do not see much greater
risk with this changc the President
has just made over what has been
in effect the last couple of years."
