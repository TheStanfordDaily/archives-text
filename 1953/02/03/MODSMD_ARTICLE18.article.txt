## 
### RUTH JAHNKE 
Who: Everyone.
Where: On Stanford campus.
What: Follow instructions for
Civil Defense.
When: Any time, day or
night.
Why: Disaster has panicked
the Bay Area.
How: Air raid, earthquake,
fire, flood, or invasion.
This situation is improbable, but
certainly not impossible. For that
reason, Stanford students, faculty,
stafT, and residents of University
property are protected by a highly i
developed and organized Civil De
fense program. And our organiza
tion is hut one small cog in the
Civil Defense organization of Santa
Clara County, of the Bay Area, of
California, and ultimately of the
nation.
Who runs this organization, and
how does it work?
The Civil Defense Commander
is Mf E. Rrnndin; his first nltcr
nale is Donald .1. (iray, professor
of anatomy; and the second al
ternate is Elmer M. Grieder, as
sociate director of the library.
Chief of StafT is P. G. DufTy, who |
is now in the hospital. In DufTy's
absence, J. M. Marston is acting
Chief of StafT. Radiating out from
this nucleus are eight chiefs, for
each special, strategic department.
Marston is Fire Department

Chief; Miss Anastasia Doyle is in
charge of Emergency Housing
Service; Miss Caroline Kicker is
Emergency Fowl Service Chief;
C. L. Blacker is Emergency Pub
lic Works Chief; (i. 11. Davis is
Police Department Chief; Donald
(.ray is Assistant Chief of Staff,
Service; Miss Christine Kicker is
is Emergency Medical Service
Chief; and Major 11. 15. Glaister
is Military Aid Chief.
Assuming that disaster struck on
campus or nearby, this is how the
network would operate;
If the disaster struck nearby, the
Santa Clara County Civil Defense
Center in San Jose would notify
Chief Marston by means of the
two-way radio communication sys
tem. If the disaster struck Stan
ford, then we would notify San Jo: c
by radio. Iti either event, the alert
would lie mounded over the Fire
liouse horn. The alert i; three min
utes of short blasts on the horn.
When the alert is sounded, all
persons in (he area are required
to follow the instructions on (he
blue and while posters in all liv
ing groups and buildings. When
the all-clear sounds (three on°-
minute blasts), resources of men
and equipment .vill be evaluated
and put to the most strategic
uses.
In the event that disaster should
strike Stanford. Dean of Men Rich
ard Balch will head the Student In
formation Center. Balch. Director
of Information Pete Allen, and

Dcnn ol Women Elva Brown will
from Ihe Dean of Students'
office on Inner Quad where all the
student records are kept.
The Student Information Cen
ter will handle all messages to
and from the thousands of wor
ried parents. Contact with the

Civil Defense Command, which
will use thr Firehouse as head
quarters. will he maintained by
telephone, and hy messengers if
the telephones go.
Fire Chief Marston will disperse
equipment to designated stations,
and will carry out the usual duties

of fire-fißhting, aided by the two
way radio set-up on the trucks.
Miss Doyle will take care of
any necessary reallocation of stu
dents, for instance if one of the
dc/rms was demolished, and will
prepare for any refugees from
San Francisco or the Bay Area.

Miss Ricker will survey the food
supply after the raid and inspect
the water supply. Major Glaister
will assemble all ROTC men and
deploy them to predetermined po
sitions.
Blacker will re-establish com
munications and transportation,
and mobilize equipment for re
moving persons from buildings.
Dr. Ilouek will provide care for
the wounded and effect the trans
formation of dorms into emer
gency hospitals if the need is
great enough.
Police Chief Davis is in charge
of the wardens. The area has been
divided into 25 geographical zones,
each with a warden. These zones
cover all the settled areas of the
campus, classrooms, and residences.
The wardens are professors, staff
members, and others who are per
manent residents of the area.
Each living unit has a disaster
organization s»t tip to operate in
any disaster. This is included in
Civil Defense, and is under the j
administration of Miss Doyle. The
living groups are divided into
seven zones.
The ROTC men will be assembled
by Major Glaister and dispatched
to the points of greatest need. The
Air ROTC men will aid Blacker in
the Public Works Department in \
getting people out of wreckage, and j
re-establishing contact with the i
rest of the world. The Army ROTC
men will assist Chief Davis and the i
warden? in their work.


TWO WAY RADIO This equipment is used to maintain continuous contact with the Civil De
fense Center for Santa Clara County in $an Jose. The control room is located in the Firehouse,
which would become the headquarters for this area in case of disaster. The machine in the riqht
center of the picture is the mechanism which oparates the Firehouse horn which blasts twice
daily and would bo used to alert the campus in the event of a disaster. —Photo by lay Becker
