## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 (UP)
—President Eisenhower told a
cheering Congress today he has
freed Chiang Kai-shek to hit the
Chinese Communist mainland
and disclosed he will ask the
lawmakers to repudiate any
secret Roosevelt - Truman pacts
with Stalin.
In his first State of the Union
message outlining a "new, positive
foreign policy" and a "middle way"
at home, Mr. Eisenhower also called
for an end to all wage-prk« con
trols April 30. He said federal rent
controls should be ended except in
severe housing shortage areas.
The President, in an hour-long
address interrupted 55 times by ap
plause, cautioned against hasty tax
cuts before the budget is balanced
and said the United States will con
tinue to help other free nations to
the extent they share the common
defense load.
Mr. Eisenhower also said the
United States has "incontrover
tible evidence that Russia pos
sesses atomic weapons." Former
President Truman recently stir
red up an angry controversy by
expressing doubt that Russia has
a workable A-bomb.
Mr. Eisenhower drew his greatest
burst of cheers when he said the
U.S. Seventh Fleet no longer would
be used to block Chinese National
ist forces on Formosa from staging
hit-and-run raids against the coast
of Communist China.
White House Press Secretary
James C. Hagerty said later that
Mr. Eisenhower had not yet issued
the actual order instructing the
fleet to "no longer shield Commu
nist China" from attacks by the
Nationalists.
Asked about the proposed re
pudiation of secret Democratic
agreements \vith Russia, Hagerty
said this included Yalta, Potsdam,
and "any or all secret agreements
that may have been made in the
past."
Rep. Charles J. Kersten (R., Wis.)
promptly introduced a resolution io
declare the Roosevelt-Stalin agree
ments at Yalta "null and void."
Kersten said the pact violated the
rights of the Chinese and Polish
people without their knowledge or
consent.
The State Department said this
country's decision regarding the
Seventh Fleet was taken on its
own since advance approval was
not required from other UN na
tions fighting in Korea. But it
emphasized that the 16 nations
with forces In Korea were noti
fied in advance.
While some Democrats had mis
givings about this change in Far
Eastern policy, Pacific Fleet Com
mander Adm. Arthur W. Radford
said after a White House confer
ence that he does not believe there
will be any immediate major Na
tionalist raids.

red up an angry controversy by
expressing doubt that Russia has
a workable A-bomb.
Mr. Eisenhower drew his greatest
burst of cheers when he said the
U.S. Seventh Fleet no longer would
be used to block Chinese National
ist forces on Formosa from staging
hit-and-run raids against the coast
of Communist China.
White House Press Secretary
James C. Hagerty said later that
Mr. Eisenhower had not yet issued
the actual order instructing the
fleet to "no longer shield Commu
nist China" from attacks by the
Nationalists.
Asked about the proposed re
pudiation of secret Democratic
agreements \vith Russia, Hagerty
said this included Yalta, Potsdam,
and "any or all secret agreements
that may have been made in the
past."
Rep. Charles J. Kersten (R., Wis.)
promptly introduced a resolution io
declare the Roosevelt-Stalin agree
ments at Yalta "null and void."
Kersten said the pact violated the
rights of the Chinese and Polish
people without their knowledge or
consent.
The State Department said this
country's decision regarding the
Seventh Fleet was taken on its
own since advance approval was
not required from other UN na
tions fighting in Korea. But it
emphasized that the 16 nations
with forces In Korea were noti
fied in advance.
While some Democrats had mis
givings about this change in Far
Eastern policy, Pacific Fleet Com
mander Adm. Arthur W. Radford
said after a White House confer
ence that he does not believe there
will be any immediate major Na
tionalist raids.
