# Women Candidates Begin Campaigns
## 
### 
A week of campaigning began
yesterday for 37 candidates for As
sociated Women Students and Wo
men's Athletic Association offices.
The candidates will be introduced
to residents of Lagunita Court at
special meetings tonight. Dessert will
be served at the meetings.
AWS Election Board chairman
Merrilee Moore stressed the impor
tance of attendance at these and
other campaign meetings, so that
women students will become well
enough acquainted with the candi
dates to vote intelligently. Primaries
will be Feb. 10 and the finals Feb. 12.
