# Why a New Union?
## 
### 
With the many desperate needs of the Uni
versity at this time, the question may still exist
in the minds of many students: Why are we
going to build a new union? Why not use the
money for something else?
In its simplest terms, the answer boils down
to: the decision has already been made. The
money has been committed. It is not within
our province to challenge it.
But there is more to the case than one short
paragraph—many years of history and consid
eration. And perhaps a brief review of those
years will amplify the situation.
Since before World War II there have been
frequent complaints of the inadequacy of our
present student union as a center of student
activities and recreation, as a place in which
ASSU organizations Could carry out their func
tions with even a measure of effectiveness.
However, until 1947 the volume of these com
plaints was held in check by one insurmount
able problem: there were no available funds
and no apparent sources of future funds.
But by the end of 1947, a debt of over $300,000
that the ASSU had incurred to pay for Memorial
Auditorium was paid off. The funds that had
been used for this purpose—sl per student's
tuition per quarter and the profits from the
various Union services—could be applied to
something else.
At the suggestion of Excom and with the ap
proval of the Board of Trustees, President Tres
idder established a new agency account on the

University's books to receive these monies.
The account was entitled "Associated Student-
Student Union Fund," and the idea was to ac
cumulate money until there was enough to
build a new student union.
The tragic death of President Tresidder early
in 1948 galvanized further action. Excom ap
pointed a committee to investigate establish
ing a suitable memorial for him. Besides a
new union a new pavilion was also considered,
and so was a scholarship program, housing fa
cilities, and other items,
Mrs. Tresidder backed the union idea in view
of her late husband's constant interest in stu
dent activities. In the spring of 1948 Excom
forwarded to the Board of Trustees its sugges
tion that a new student union be built as the
Tresidder Memorial Union.
Upon consideration the Board approved the
suggestion, arid its approval was given to Ex
com over the endorsement of Paul Edwards,
board chairman.
Since then the building fund has been ac
cumulating until now there is sufficient money
to begin the firsf units of the new union.
We find sufficient evidence to indicate that
the decision was made with due consideration
for the needs of the University balanced with
suitability of a memorial.
Therefore, we feel that instead of spending
any thought re-evaluating the decision, the stu
dents today should determine the best method
of executing it.

cumulate money until there was enough to
build a new student union.
The tragic death of President Tresidder early
in 1948 galvanized further action. Excom ap
pointed a committee to investigate establish
ing a suitable memorial for him. Besides a
new union a new pavilion was also considered,
and so was a scholarship program, housing fa
cilities, and other items,
Mrs. Tresidder backed the union idea in view
of her late husband's constant interest in stu
dent activities. In the spring of 1948 Excom
forwarded to the Board of Trustees its sugges
tion that a new student union be built as the
Tresidder Memorial Union.
Upon consideration the Board approved the
suggestion, arid its approval was given to Ex
com over the endorsement of Paul Edwards,
board chairman.
Since then the building fund has been ac
cumulating until now there is sufficient money
to begin the firsf units of the new union.
We find sufficient evidence to indicate that
the decision was made with due consideration
for the needs of the University balanced with
suitability of a memorial.
Therefore, we feel that instead of spending
any thought re-evaluating the decision, the stu
dents today should determine the best method
of executing it.
With the many desperate needs of the Uni
versity at this time, the question may still exist
in the minds of many students: Why are we
going to build a new union? Why not use the
money for something else?
In its simplest terms, the answer boils down
to: the decision has already been made. The
money has been committed. It is not within
our province to challenge it.
But there is more to the case than one short
paragraph—many years of history and consid
eration. And perhaps a brief review of those
years will amplify the situation.
Since before World War II there have been
frequent complaints of the inadequacy of our
present student union as a center of student
activities and recreation, as a place in which
ASSU organizations Could carry out their func
tions with even a measure of effectiveness.
However, until 1947 the volume of these com
plaints was held in check by one insurmount
able problem: there were no available funds
and no apparent sources of future funds.
But by the end of 1947, a debt of over $300,000
that the ASSU had incurred to pay for Memorial
Auditorium was paid off. The funds that had
been used for this purpose—sl per student's
tuition per quarter and the profits from the
various Union services—could be applied to
something else.
At the suggestion of Excom and with the ap
proval of the Board of Trustees, President Tres
idder established a new agency account on the

University's books to receive these monies.
The account was entitled "Associated Student-
Student Union Fund," and the idea was to ac
cumulate money until there was enough to
build a new student union.
