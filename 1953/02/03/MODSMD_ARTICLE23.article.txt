## From Another Viewpoint The 						Loneliest Place on Campus 
### GRAHAM DuSHANE 
(Ed. note: In this week's faculty guest column
Dr. Graham P. DuShane, professor of biology, pre
sents his description of "The Loneliest Place on
Campus," the lectern of the biology 2 meetings,
Wednesday and mornings at eleven.

For me the loneliest place on the campus is not the
Cactus Garden at noon on a midsummer's day nor the
Frost Amphitheatre before dawn on Christmas, but
die stage of the Memorial Auditorium for the first
few minutes of the eleven o'clock hour Wednesdays
and Fridays.

For the lecturer is at first quite
alone. The microphone hung
round his neck is no fit com
panion, but rather a malicious or
at least a capricious instrument.
One moment it may snatch away
and broadcast a muttered,
"Where's that eraser?" with dis
concerting clarity and the next
begin its feedback with an
ominous and augmenting roar,
drowning out the words intended

for the forest of ears out front. Each trip to the black
board gives a turn to the microphone strap; it. tightens
giadually, relentlessly during the hour.
And the blackboard itself! Letters must be half
a foot high to be seen in the back of the hall. It is
easy to drop a letter or a syllable from these gi-,
gantic words, especially if the microphone strap has
begun its stealthy compression of the jugular veins
and carotid sinuses. If he has dropped a syllable.

a titter from the mezzanine and a few seal barks
from the balcony make him alert. He makes the
correction.
But suppose a hasty inspection turns up no error
on the board. Acting in the approved scientific tra
dition, he develops what he thinks of as an alterna
tive hypothesis: there may be a dog on the stage.
He sees none, but recalls that negative evidence is
not conclusive. He looks again. No dog.
On second thought the laughter evoked by a dog
on the stage is more robust, more whole hearted,
less snickering, and always punctuated by whistles
and sympathetic animal sounds. After all, he had
been talking. Could he have said something that had
a secondary meaning? Experience has taught him
that a word that is innocuous in a small room, may
be loaded in a large one. He remembers how it
took him several hours to find out why gails of
laughter, incredibly callous and heartless it seemed
at the time, once greeted a reference to a "spastic."
Modern slang, not lack of human sympathy was
behind that, or so he likes to think.
On with the lecture! Still he can't help dwelling
for an instant on the temporarily inexplicable merri
ment once aroused by his use of the general term for
cell division in an animal egg. Have the radio gagsters
given this generation a heightened capacity to hear
words out of context?
But there are rewards. There are days, and there
are many, when all goes well, when the microphone
behaves, when communication is good, and when the
auditors put down "The Dippy" and seem interested
and responsive. On days like this the lecturer ceases
to feel alone. The crowd is no longer a faceless mass,
but a fine, friendly, alert group of young Americans,
brimming with intellectual curiosity.

And the blackboard itself! Letters must be half
a foot high to be seen in the back of the hall. It is
easy to drop a letter or a syllable from these gi-,
gantic words, especially if the microphone strap has
begun its stealthy compression of the jugular veins
and carotid sinuses. If he has dropped a syllable.

a titter from the mezzanine and a few seal barks
from the balcony make him alert. He makes the
correction.
But suppose a hasty inspection turns up no error
on the board. Acting in the approved scientific tra
dition, he develops what he thinks of as an alterna
tive hypothesis: there may be a dog on the stage.
He sees none, but recalls that negative evidence is
not conclusive. He looks again. No dog.
On second thought the laughter evoked by a dog
on the stage is more robust, more whole hearted,
less snickering, and always punctuated by whistles
and sympathetic animal sounds. After all, he had
been talking. Could he have said something that had
a secondary meaning? Experience has taught him
that a word that is innocuous in a small room, may
be loaded in a large one. He remembers how it
took him several hours to find out why gails of
laughter, incredibly callous and heartless it seemed
at the time, once greeted a reference to a "spastic."
Modern slang, not lack of human sympathy was
behind that, or so he likes to think.
On with the lecture! Still he can't help dwelling
for an instant on the temporarily inexplicable merri
ment once aroused by his use of the general term for
cell division in an animal egg. Have the radio gagsters
given this generation a heightened capacity to hear
words out of context?
But there are rewards. There are days, and there
are many, when all goes well, when the microphone
behaves, when communication is good, and when the
auditors put down "The Dippy" and seem interested
and responsive. On days like this the lecturer ceases
to feel alone. The crowd is no longer a faceless mass,
but a fine, friendly, alert group of young Americans,
brimming with intellectual curiosity.

(Ed. note: In this week's faculty guest column
Dr. Graham P. DuShane, professor of biology, pre
sents his description of "The Loneliest Place on
Campus," the lectern of the biology 2 meetings,
Wednesday and mornings at eleven.

For me the loneliest place on the campus is not the
Cactus Garden at noon on a midsummer's day nor the
Frost Amphitheatre before dawn on Christmas, but
die stage of the Memorial Auditorium for the first
few minutes of the eleven o'clock hour Wednesdays
and Fridays.

For the lecturer is at first quite
alone. The microphone hung
round his neck is no fit com
panion, but rather a malicious or
at least a capricious instrument.
One moment it may snatch away
and broadcast a muttered,
"Where's that eraser?" with dis
concerting clarity and the next
begin its feedback with an
ominous and augmenting roar,
drowning out the words intended

for the forest of ears out front. Each trip to the black
board gives a turn to the microphone strap; it. tightens
