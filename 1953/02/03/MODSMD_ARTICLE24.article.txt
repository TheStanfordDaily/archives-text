## More on 'Sahara' Didn't Understand 
### 
To the Editor:
Oscar Weiskopf has a valid objection to the show
ing of such a propaganda film as "Sahara." It would
be best for all concerned to bury the hatchet, and
pictures such as this are no help. Perhaps the movie
chairman did not realize what type of picture this
was. If he did, I would suggest that he consult with
the lIR to co-ordinate attitudes toward Germany.
Mr. Weiskopf, however, did not understand the
audience reaction to this picture. I saw the thing and
laughed, too. But not at the sight of countless Ger
mans being killed. I laughed at the completely im
probable plot which showed grimacing Humphrey
Bogart taking on practically the whole Germany Army
almost singlehandedly, and in the best Hollywood
tradition, coming out without a Scratch. I hope that
before Mr. Weiskopf returns to Germany, he learns
that the American can find something to laugh at in
any situation, particularly in Hollywood's corny at
tempts at flagwaving melodrama.
