# Objection Overruled

To the Editor:
I very definitely do not agree with Mr. Weiskopf.
I am an immigrant from Holland and have spent all

the war years in the resistance movement. I am very
much afraid that I (and millions of Europeans with
me) am "wise" to the German mentality. I think that
far more movies should be shown to the American
people who are only too ignorant about what was, and
still is, goinrj on across the Atlantic.
To use Mr. Weiskopf's own words, (slightly
changed): The American people should not trust the
"democratic" German government when it reads in
a magazine about neo-Nazism; it is not "neo," it is
the same old thing, the real McCoy all over again.
Which in European opinions is not surprising at all,
when one stops to think about the fact, that for the
past twenty-five years Germaris have been absorbing
Nazism from the very first drop of their mother's
milk. An evil so deeply rooted is hard if not im
possible to destroy.
I also think that in stirring-up distrust for what
Nazism stands for the American people, who have
never known the terror and frustration of occupation
or slavery, might be put on guard for the threat of
Communism. What is going on behind the iron cur
tain today is merely a case of "l'histoire se repete."
So I say: give the American people more and more
war and occupation movies in order for them to
learn what they can expect if ever anything should
happen to this country. As soon as they understand
this, only then will.they know the reason why, for
what cause, so many Americans and Allied soldiers
are giving their lives in Korea today.
