# Exchange Scholars Learn About Europe
## 
### WIN GRIFFITH 
Ynez Viole, Roselyn Hutton, Jerry Drobny, and Larry Seering
are living and studying in Europe this year.
They are former Stanford students who are now "exchange
scholars," and they have been granted the opportunity to advance
their education and develop their understanding of Europe as a

result of the efforts of the ASSU 4
Foreign Scholarship Committee. I
The committee, headed by Don !
Price and Garner Beckett, has !
brought eight foreign students to j
Stanford this year. Three of those |
eight ASSU Foreign Scholars, Eva '
Ginglinger, Ed Hagen, and Oscar |
Weiskopf, have made it possible for j
the exchanges to be arranged.
Ynez Viole, exchange for Eva j
Ginglinger, is studying at the Uni
versity of Grenoble on a French gov
ernment scholarship. Roselyn Hut
ton, exchange for Ed Hagen, is using
a University of Frankfurt scholarship
to st&dy in Germany.
Jerry Drobny and Larry Seering
are at the University Â»112 Munich in
exchange for Oscar Weiskopf.
Seering received his scholarship
from the Bavarian Ministry of Ed
ucation and Drobny was granted a
scholarship from the students of
tlu? University of Munich.
The value of the program is ex
pressed briefly by co-chairman Price:
"The benefits of the scholarship
to the Stanford student are in
estimable, particularly when the
student would otherwise be unable

to study abroad. Such exchanges
are of importance in the main
tenance of friendly co-operation by
the two schools. The reciprocation
of the awards by foreign univer
sities brings direct benefits to Stan
ford students, and this is made
clearly familiar to the student body
through the media of the Stanford
Daily, in which excerpts of letters
from the exchanges can be
printed."
The attitudes of the exchange stu
dents themselves was expressed by
Roselyn Hutton in a letter received
by the committee at the beginning
of the year:
"This year is a challenge. I've be
gun to realize how much foreign stu
dents must appreciate the little things
that interested students do to help
them adjust to a different university
life. I promise to write occasionally
a report of my activities at the Uni
versity of Frankfurt and details
which might be of interest to the
student body. Thank you again for
the opportunity which you have
made possible."
