# Unbeaten Washington Leads Northern Division
## 
### 
With each passing week, it be
comes more and more apparent
that the University of Washington
wil be the host team lor the PCC
Divisional Playoffs beginning on
March 6.
Headed by '"Hook Shot" Bob i
Houbregs, who is scoring at a near 1
30-point-per-game pace in confer- \
ence play, the Huskies also loom as
the first Northern Division quintet
to run through the 16-game slate
without a defeat.
As the conference race stands
now, the Washington five is hall
way toward its goal. Although not
participating in conference compe- |
tition last week, the Huskies have
*piled up an 8-0 mark, and are the ]
only Northern Division squad to be !
playing better than .500 ball in
games
Unbeaten Season
The chances for Washington to !
be the first Northern Division team !
to finish up their conference activi- 1
ties with a perfect record are ex- j
cellent. In their eight wins, the j
Huskies have had only one close |

call, a 79-73 triumph over Oregon.
The rest of the victories were by
margins of 12 points or more.
Idaho, the team given the best
chance of halting Houbregs and
company, found itself snowed un
der in a pair of contests. Bob found
the basket for 35 points to spark a
76-64 win in their first meeting,
and then followed that with a stu
pendous 49-point effort the next
nit;ht, as Washington swamped the
Potato Staters, 82 to 58.
Season - wise, Washington has
compiled an 18 and 1 record, the
lone blot a 54-47 trimming by UC
LA at the Westwood sweatbox.
That setback was avenged.
The battle for second spot behind
the Huskies has turned into a real
scramble. Tied for the runner-up
positions with 4-4 league marks
are Idaho and Oregon. Oregon
State's Beavers are a game behind
that pair with a three won and five
lost conference record. Bringing up
the rear is Washington State, which
has won but one game out of eight
conference starts.
In the race for individual scoring

honors in the PCC's northern sec
tion, Houbregs is, as mentioned be
fore, spreadeagling the field.
The G-7 center has tanked 85 field
goals and 57 foul shots in his eight
tilts for a 227-point accumulage.
This gives him a 29.5 average.
A distant second is Idaho's 6-8
center, Hartley Kruger. Kruger has
tallied 142 points in eight games for
a 17.8 average.
Another towering center, G-7
Chet Noe of Oregon, is in third
place, with 132 markers for a 16.5-
per-game output.
Statistics in the Southern Divi
sion remain unchanged, since there
has been no league play since Jan.
17. The Southern Division fives
don't resume conference activities
until Feb. 13.
Northern Division Play
League play continues in the
Northern Section tonight with Ida
ho playing Oregon Sffite at Corval

In weekend games, Washington

State at Seattle, Friday and Satur
day. Idaho will still be on the road,
playing Oregon at Eugene the same
evenings.
All Southern Division teams are
slated for outside competition.
Stanford plays its alumni tonight

Cow Palace the Indians play Brad
ley.

City, where the Bears play Utah,

USC is in Hawaii for three games
