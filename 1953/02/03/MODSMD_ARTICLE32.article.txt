# Deal for Kiner?

### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 2 (UP)—The
efforts of the Cincinnati Reds and
Boston Braves to acquire Ralph Ki
ner from the Pittsburgh Pirates hit
a snag today when Branch Rickey
declared, "I have no deal now that
is acceptable to me."
Rickey, who only 24 hours ear
lier said a deal for Kiner wad im
minent, conferred with Gabe Paul
of the Reds and John Quinn of the
Braves and they "doubted whether
a deal will be made." .
Rickey, however, repeated his in-

tontions of obtaining desperately
needed infield strength for the Pi
rates with the comment:
"I have to make a deal for an
infielder for common decency."
Rickey also revealed that he is
scheduled to confer with Sid Math
ews, director of player personnel
for the Chicago Cubs, tomorrow.
Mathews is a former associate of
Rickey when Branch was general
manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers.
