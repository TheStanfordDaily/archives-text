# Frosh Cagers' in Streak Threatened Against Braves in Varsity Preliminary
## 
### WES MARX 
Inter athletic department rivalry
will take place tonight beginning at
6:15 as the Stanford Braves face the
Stanford Papooses in the Pavilion.
The breach in the Stanford athletic
family will find the Braves out to
curtail the 11 game undefeated streak
of their younger brothers. The
Braves had a win streak of seven
until two weeks ago when Sant:
Ro?a Junior College edged them,
81-80. After that climactic defeat
the Braves have won two games.
Last weekend the frosh gathered
two wins with victories over Lincoln
High School and St. Mary's frosh.
Termed their toughest foe of the
season by Coach Dick Clegg, St.
Mary's fell into the Papoose victory
column, Gl-55. One of St. Mary's
wins came against Santa Rosa, the
five which ended the JV win streak.
Prominent in the Frosh win were
George Selleek, Bill Flanders, and
Gunnar Christiansen. Selleek, who
leads team scoring with 1(50 points,
played a stellar defensive game
stopping the Gaels's fast driving at
tack numerous times. Of the seven
assists chalked up by the Papooses on
offense the Compton lad contributed
four.
Christiansen, a forward, showed
his ability in the clutch by putting
in seven points during the fourth
quarter, when the frosh came from
behind to win. The other forward,
Flanders, an off and on starter,
finally played up to his potential as
he lead his teammates in field goals
with 5.
Starting against the Braves along
with these will be center Denny
Uoren and guard Ron Wagner.
Probable starters for Coach George
Lynn will be Bob Ogoreck and Jim
Westphal at the forwards, Wayne
Culberson at the pivot, and Wayne
Loekhart and Paul Johnson at
guards. The, JV's last tilt was a
week ago when they had little
trouble with Monterey's Lobos, win
ning 95-49.

played a stellar defensive game
stopping the Gaels's fast driving at
tack numerous times. Of the seven
assists chalked up by the Papooses on
offense the Compton lad contributed
four.
Christiansen, a forward, showed
his ability in the clutch by putting
in seven points during the fourth
quarter, when the frosh came from
behind to win. The other forward,
Flanders, an off and on starter,
finally played up to his potential as
he lead his teammates in field goals
with 5.
Starting against the Braves along
with these will be center Denny
Uoren and guard Ron Wagner.
Probable starters for Coach George
Lynn will be Bob Ogoreck and Jim
Westphal at the forwards, Wayne
Culberson at the pivot, and Wayne
Loekhart and Paul Johnson at
guards. The, JV's last tilt was a
week ago when they had little
trouble with Monterey's Lobos, win
ning 95-49.


FROSH BIG GUN—One of the reasons for the freshman basket
ball team's success is George Selleek, who has sparkled of
fensively and defensively. Selleek will be the man the Braves
will attempt to stop tonight. —Daily photo by Jack Byrne
