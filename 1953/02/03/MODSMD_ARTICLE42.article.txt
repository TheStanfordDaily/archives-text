It may cost $2.03 .to mail that
letter, Police Chief Gordon Davis
warned yesterday, as he cautioned
students that police are going to
begin a crack-down on favorite il
legal parking places around cam
pus.
The three most frequent viola
tions, he said, are:
1. Left-hand parking in front of
the post office. If students coming
down the Row don't-stop swinging
over to the wrong side of the street
to park directly in front of the post
office, the police force will again
detail one man just to patrol that
area.
2. In front of Branner. Students
have removed three signs forbid
ding parking on the road running
in front of Branner. From now on,
Davis said, police will tag any cars
found parking there, despite the
lack of a sign.
3. Double parking in front of
Mem Aud on Sunday nights. The
chief said that the second line in
the turning basin causes dangerous
congestion, and that any cars found
so parked will be tagged.
