AMSTERDAM, Feb. :i (UP)
The death toll in Western Europe's
worst storm of the cc itury passed
1,000 today as the North Sea
pounded against crumbling dykes
of Holland and an armada of small
boats battled through icy seas to
ward inundated Dutch islands.
Iu Holland alone, more than 600
were known dead, and as the na
tion's famous dykes continued to
crumble and ominous distress calls
were received from isolated com
munities, it was certain .the toll
would go higher.
All the nation's resources were
mobilized to cope with the unprece
dented peacetime disaster. In Bel
gium, too, the government . took
over complete direction of all res
cue operations and assistance for
its 5,000 homeless refugees.
The known overall death toll
; tood at 1,083 todayâ€”Holland 605,
?'f itain 310, Belgium 16, and Ger
i any seven, plus 145 drowned in
bo ship disasters off Britain.
