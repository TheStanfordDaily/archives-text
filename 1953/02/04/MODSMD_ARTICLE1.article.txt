## 
### 
Stanford's cagers waltzed to
an 82 53 win over an outgunned
alumni team before a sparse
crowd in the Pavilion last night.
A good time was had by all.
Twenty-three players scored in
tlie wilrl contest, with Ron Tomsic
and Paul Johnson of the varsity
leading the parade with 13 markers.
The alumni were bolstered by the
return of two All-Coast veterans,
Dave Davidson and Babe Higgins.
Both showed an expanded waist
line and a diminished shooting eye,
but they still retained enough class
to dump in 12 points each in about
25 minutes of play. Milt Iverson, a
teammate of Higgins and Davidson, j
also scored 10.

lead, but the varsity tied it up on I

a lay-up by Tomsic and went
ahead on a hook by Lawler from
the key. From there on they were
never headed.
By the end of the first half, the
Indians had amassed a 43-29 lead.
Lawler, who towered four inches
over everyone else on the floor,
dumped in 10 points on soft hooks
and tip-ins, and Tomsic and Don
Carlson seven and six more.
In the third quarter, the first
string alums found their second
wind and played the varsity on
about an even keel. In the final
quarter, Coach Burnett cleared the
bench, but the score still went out
of control.
Johnson, a sub, scored his 13
markers in about ten minutes.

number six is Fritz Fenster. Bill Christiansen is number twenty
two. Other Indian at the far right is center Russ Lawler.

Big Don Carlson, always a good
floor man, shot seldom, and still hit
ten points. If his jump shot keeps
hitting, Carlson will be invaluable
to the Cards.

up because of an injured elbow. He

Stanford's cagers waltzed to
an 82 53 win over an outgunned
alumni team before a sparse
crowd in the Pavilion last night.
A good time was had by all.
Twenty-three players scored in
tlie wilrl contest, with Ron Tomsic
and Paul Johnson of the varsity
leading the parade with 13 markers.
The alumni were bolstered by the
return of two All-Coast veterans,
Dave Davidson and Babe Higgins.
Both showed an expanded waist
line and a diminished shooting eye,
but they still retained enough class
to dump in 12 points each in about
25 minutes of play. Milt Iverson, a
teammate of Higgins and Davidson, j
also scored 10.

ahead on a hook by Lawler from
the key. From there on they were
never headed.
By the end of the first half, the
Indians had amassed a 43-29 lead.
Lawler, who towered four inches
over everyone else on the floor,
dumped in 10 points on soft hooks
and tip-ins, and Tomsic and Don
Carlson seven and six more.
In the third quarter, the first
string alums found their second
wind and played the varsity on
about an even keel. In the final
quarter, Coach Burnett cleared the
bench, but the score still went out
of control.
Johnson, a sub, scored his 13
markers in about ten minutes.
