## 
### 
LONDON, Feb. 3 (UP)—Foreign
Secretary Anthony Eden told the
House of Commons today President
Eisenhower's decision on Formosa
may have "unfortunate political re
percussions without compensating
military advantages."
Eden addressed the House at the
same moment Secretary of State
John Foster Dulles arrived here for
a series of top level talks that may
bring a showdown on the growing
differences between the United
States and Britain on Far Eastern
policy.
Dulles, accompanied by Mutual
Security Administrator Harold E.
Stassen, came here to discuss Eu
ropean defense but found their
main topic had been shoved far into
the background by outright British
opposition to Mr. Eisenhower's de
cision to free the Nationalist troops.
Dulles' arrival could hardly have
come at a more' dramatic moment.
As his plane landed at London Air
port Eden was announcing formally
in the House of Commons that Brit
ain protested the Formosa decision
before it was announced in the
President's State of the Union mes
sage.
"Her Majesty's government were
informed in advance of this deci
sion by the U.S. government and
at once made known their concern
at this decision, which they fear
will have unfortunate political re
percussions without compensating
military advantages," Eden said.
Eden, busy in Commons, was the
first foreign minister to fail to meet
Dulles and Stassen-. They had been
met by the foreign ministers of Italy
and France when they arrived in
those countries.
