TAIPEH, Formosa, Feb. 3 HJp;
â€” Generalissimo Chiang Kai
shek pledged today that he
would not ask help from the
ground forces of any nation in
his campaign to win hack the
Communist-held China main
land.
He left the way open, however, t>>
seek air and naval support.
The president of Nationalist
China gave his pledge in a formal
statement following President Ei
senhower's announcement that the
U.S. Seventh Fleet no longer would
shield the Red mainland from at
tack.
Chianq said the new policy is
"militarily and morally sound."
"Whilcv our own plan for fight
ing Communism and regaining
the main 1 a n H necessarily will
form an important link in the
(general plan to combat world
wide aggression," he said, "I
would like to assure our friends
abroad that the Republic of China
will not ask for aid in ground
forces from any nation to achieve
our goal. In fact, China has never
made such an appeal nor has
China ever cherished such illu
sions."

Chiang said Eisenhower's move
was "not only judicious hut mili
tarily and morally sound. The gov
ernment of the Republic of China
and, I am sure, its 450,000,000 peo
ple (including those on the main
land) unanimously welcome such a
decision."
He did not mention air and naval
upport but observers here believed
the possibility of seeking such air!
was implicit in his appeal for
worldwide support for the "moral
force" of Eisenhower's decision.
"It is my conviction," he said,
"that only through giving unani
mous support to the moral force
of such a decision can all free
dom - loving countries hope to
achieve, by degrees, a solidarity
necessary for arrest! ig the ag
gression of international Com
munism.
"It is only when Communist ag
gressors are made to realize ag
gression does not pay that we may
hope to restore peace and security
to the world."
The statement was drawn up per
sonally by the Generalissimo after
a conference with top government
officials and military leaders. Sev
eral drafts, in Chinese, were dis
carded before the final one was ap
proved for translation into English.
