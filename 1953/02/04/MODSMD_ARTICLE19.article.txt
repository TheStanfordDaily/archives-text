WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 (UP)
A naval blockade of Red Chinn
may be the next stop in Pro: i
dent Eisenhower's bold now
program to try to force the Com
munists to negotiate peaco n
Korea, congressional and mili
tary experts said today.
They gave their opinion , in if ••
wake of Mi - . Eisenhowei dec
sion to free Chiang Kai-shek': 'I.
nese Nationalist forces on Fore:.-). ■
for hit-and-run raids on the Chin <
coast. They did not profn s to
know specifically what the Pri ;-
dent might have in mind next.
But Chairman Dewey Short
(K., Mo.) of the House Ann I
Services Committee said a nav .)
blockade may be next move
to "step up the pressure" on &'< <1
China. He conceded there might
be risk of general war in such ,i
course, but said, "We can't i<n
ever have a stalemate" in Kon 1
Mr. Eisenhower's Formosa de 1
sion was intended to divert out
Chinese Communist strength t'r m
Korea and reduce pre ~: tin- on
American Gl's. A blockade wonM
be intended to prevent Red Chin >
from receiving vital war :;uppli •?
by sea, some of them from th: ;
country's allies.
Rep. James E. Van Zandt (11.,
Pa.), a member 01 the House
Armed Services Committee, pre
dicted a blockade would b«- es
tablished to "stop the thousand .
of tons of critical materials that
are flowing into ports like Shang
hai, Yunghai, and Amoy in ship ,
flying the flags of Britain, Pan
ama, Poland, and Norway."
Gen. Omar N. Bradley, chairman
of the Joint, Chiefs of Staff,
asked in a radio interview Mom.! ; /
night what possible course:; of ac
tion are open in Korea. He «1,1 .1
naval blockade of China "might be
one of them.
A naval b lock ad c rcrtainl
would be opposed by Britain and
other members of the United \ •
tions fighting in Korea. Britain
contends a blockade would wn <!
its big colony at Hong Kong
choke off its vital Far Eastern
trade.
Other nations probably wouM
object that, although not an o <11
act of war, it might touch oil a n< //
world conflict. Tliey fear Ru 1
might come to the aid of Red ' Inn
