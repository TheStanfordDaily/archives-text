Hats off to Lloyd Leith for voluntarily guitting
the rest of his Stanford basketball officiating
assignments this year. Of course, he was prob
ably prompted a little by coach Bob Burnett's
not too complimentary report to the PCC offi
cial's commissioner, Frank McCormick.
Just the same, we hope that a couple more of
the bushers who have been working games
here this year will get the word and drop off the
bandwagon. Seems to us that the UCLA series
took a good sized chunk of the cake for poor
reffing.
We hope that Burnett and the rest of the
coaches have a few more forthright reports in
the offing, because, with the iules now within
reason, about the major need of local basket
ball is more skillful officiating.
