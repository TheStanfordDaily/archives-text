# BULL SESSION
## Embarrassing Moments 
### PETE GROTHE 
Several Roble-ites have complained that there is
not enough said about frosh women in hull session.
And so I have decided to rectify this situation.
A few days ago, I battled my way to Roble through
the fog, which is thicker than a crowd of Ilurlburt
girls around a friend who has just been pinned. How-

ever, I lost my way and wound
up at the Microwave Lab. I re
traced my steps, and with the help
ol a log horn, five flashlights, and
four Alpine Club members with
a rope, I found Roble.
And there I conducted the most
soul-searching survey since Kin
sey once made a report. I con
fronted Roble-ites and asked them
what their most embarrassing ex
perience was.

They blushed. In technicolor.
Here are their answers:
FOLLOWING THE SCRIPT — Marilyn Stanton,
Boise, Idaho, groped into a dark movie theater to see
"Sitting Pretty," couldn't see where she was going,
r;at in a man's lap.
OOPS!—Sally Thompson, Piedmont, walked into her
hotel loom, found a strange man there, demanded
thut he get out, discovered it wasn't her room.
BIBLIOGRAPHY—Jean Scholl, Los Angeles, was
driving down Colorado Blvd. in Glendale with a car
trunk full of books. A young whipper-snapper honked

at her for three blocks, finally stopped her car.
"Fresh," she snapped.
"I'm sorry," he said, referring to the line of books
strewn on the road for three blocks, "but I think you
left your library behind you."
SLEEI' VS. (.'LIiANMNESS—Lynn Lercara, Pied
mont, in a Frankfurt, Germany hotel, (1) was intent
on taking a bath, (2) knocked on the locked bathroom
door, (3) received no answer, (4) pounded again, (5)
was confronted by a disheveled German frau, ((!) was
told, "Do you mind taking a bath some other time?
I am sleeping in the bathtub!"
FORBIDDEN LAND—Lynn Colebourn. Taft, was
serving cookies at an SAE rushing party. One of the
brothers offered to show her the upstairs. She took
three steps upstairs, was greeted by a male chorus
saying, "Hey, you can't go up there," ran out the door
screaming.
ATTENTION GETTER—Nancy McDonald, Lewis
ton, Idaho, wanted to get the attention of a boy whom
she had a crush on. She (1) crossed Quad so that he
would have to pass her, (2) readied a big smile, (3)
tripped on a step, (4) fell down, (5) was helped up by
him, ((5) never saw him again.

"Wandering Skis," narrated by humorist-skier
photographer Warren Miller, goes before public in
spection at Cubberley tonight. It is undoubtedly the
best . . . and the funniest . . . movie ever turned out
on the grand old sport of skiing. See ya there.
