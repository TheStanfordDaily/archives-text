## For Whom Do the Bells Toll? 
### 
To tljo Editor:
Perhaps you can answer a question that lias boon
haunting my poor overworked'freshman mind. I have
been attending Stanford for four months now and as
well as I can remember every Sunday the bells in
Hoover Tower have been played in the morning he
lore church and in the afternoon between the hours
of one and two o'clock.
1 thoroughly enjoy the morning chimes and think
it is a very good and inspiring idea to sound the bells
as students and residents from the surrounding com
munities come to attend the Sunday morning services
al Stanford's Memorial Church.
Alter the service is over, at twelve o'clock, the people
t« turn to their residences to study. Soon, after getting
well nettled for a Sunday afternoon of intensive study
to catch upon the last week's assignments, the bells
start again.
Much to my dismay, and the dismay of quite a few
other student:;, the afternoon selection of chime melo
dies is not exactly nerve settling or helpful for con-

centrating on a thrilling chapter out nf Sisler's A
Systematic Approach to General Chemistry, or any
other assignment as the case may be.
Now comes my big question. For whom do the bells
toll between the hours of one and two o'clock on
Sunday afternoon? 1 regretfully say at this point that
they are not appreciated by this Stanford student who
likes to employ his Sunday afternoons on his studies
and who appreciates a certain degree of quietness
while doing so. As you probably know the Hoover
Tower bells can bo heard for miles around, so there
is not much chance of getting away from them without
driving for several miles which is quite impractical.
Again and finally 1 ask for whom do the bells toll?
Thank you.

received complaining about the Hoover Tower Caril
lon. As yet, no one has written complaining that
he can't study because his radio's playing too loud.)
