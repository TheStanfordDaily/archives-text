### MARY FRAZER 
Looking lor a group ot speak
ers to discuss important con
temporary problems before
your business, professional, or
social club? Anthony Hillbru
ner of the Speech and Drama
Department has the answer.
liilibruner is director of the Stu
dent Speaker Service, a non-de
partmental campus organization
which sends groups of students to
speak at public or private meetings
In short symposium-type talks,
Iwo to four students present their
opinions on the selected topic, at
tempting to develop the specific
problem in its most important
aspects for the audience. A ques
tion period follows.
The service has most recently
provided speakers for meetings of
the San Francisco Kiwanis Club
and the Mutual Business Club of
Sun Francisco. Speaking at the
Fairmont and Sir Francis Drake
Hotels, student speakers tackled
problems of "The Feasibility of
FEPC" and"The Anxieties of the
College Student."
This year's discussion topics
center around these two ques
tions and "Methods of Combating
Communism" and "Suggestions
for the Improvement of the Mor
al and Ethical Conduct of Ameri
cans." Students who participate

in the Speaker Service program
are eligible for one (o two units
of academic credit.
The Student Speaker Service has
been in existence for a number of
years, according to Hillbruner, but
only since last fall have definite
symposiums been formed.
Interested business and profes
sional groups may contact Hill
bruner to engage speakers. In
addition, circulars announcing
this University service are sent
out regularly to Peninsula or
ganizations.
Students interested in partici
pating in the Speaker Service are
invited to contact Hillbruner in the
Speech and Drama Department.
