## Sporting World Problems 
### 
There's a lot of wishing and wondering going on at the BAC. The coaches
each have their problems. Speculation is going on in track coach Jack
Wierhouser's mind, for instance. He is thinking about the 1950 Olympics
to be held in Australia. It will be the first time the games have been held
in the Southern Hemisphere.
The seasons in the "land down under" are reversed. This means that the
games will be held in the Australian summer, or about Thanksgiving time
A problem presented by this is the fact that American athletes will have
to miss from a month to six weeks of school to participate, and athletes who
want to play college football will have a tough decision to make.
But this is only a small problem compared to another one Wierhausei
must consider. Ever since the modern Olympics started the Southern Hemis
phere countries have been handicapped by the fact that their Olympic
tryouts are held in the beginning of the year, while the games are not until
the middle of July. A lot can happn in that time. Remember that John
Landy, the Australian miler who is nudging the world's record under terrible
track conditions was only an average runner three months ago, but a sudden
improvement has put him in the limelight.
For the next Olympics, if they are held in Melbourne as presently
scheduled, the U.S. will he faced with the same situation. Should we hold
the Olympic tryouts in June, a full half-year hefore the gauies. or perhaps
in September, when the players are all out of condition? This is a hard
problem to solve. Perhaps we should hope that the Australians keep up
their current bungling of the Olympic preparations, so that the games will
be shifted to I.os Angeles, thus solving the dilliculty.
