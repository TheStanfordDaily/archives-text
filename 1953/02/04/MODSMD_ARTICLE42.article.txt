# Football Lineup

Chuck Taylor continues to be faced with the question of who will be
first-string for the 1953 football Varsity. As it now appears, only quarter
back Bob Garrett has a starting berth cinched, and if Jack Gebei t improves
slightly in passing and stands out of defense, even Garrett's berth will not
be assured.
It currently looks as though Sam Motley and John Steinberg will be the
starting ends, though they may be moved out by Don Carlson, John Stewart,
or Steve Doctor. Carlson is not the pass receiver Morley or Steinberg is, but
his all-around play might net him a starting berth. Stewart and Doctor were
both outstanding on the lrosh team last season.
The tackle-to-tackle positions might see any five of the following:
Matt Armitage, Jerry Goldberg, Roy Krickeberg, John Ludcke, Norm
Manoogian, John Roherg, Glen Stanton, Dick Steere, Ted Tanner, Win
Wedge, and Phil Wilson. Manoogian, of course, is a cinch first-stringer
it he's healthy. Even the running backs, Chuck Brazel, Jarvis Watson,
Ron Cook, Jim Stewart, and Bill Rogers will have to work to keep ahead
of Jim Truher, flashy freshman runner this season, and Al Napoleon, an
outstanding back from Pasadena JC who is planning to transfer to Stan
ford next year.
