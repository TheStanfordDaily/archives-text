# Morley in Rugby
## 
### 
Speaking of football players, Sam Morley, who was a jayvee basketball
regular and occasionally saw action on the varsity, lias dropped the sport
in order to play rugby. He thinks it will help him with his football next
year. This can't be denied if we look at the long list of great gridiron
stars who also played rugby. We notice that a prospective NCAA All -
American Rugby team includes Jack Scarhath of Maryland, this year's
unanimous All-American quarterback.
Another troubled coach these days is baseball mentor Everett Dean.
It is a standing rule that no one is ever considered a cinch for the title in any
sport, especially after the California's football fiasco the past two seasons.
This is one of the few reasons the Indian baseballers aren't conceded the
title by everyone else in the league. Could pitching be another? While USC.
league champions last year, have lost their entire first team, the Cards lost
men at only two positions; catcher (where they still have the finest receiver
in the league returning this season) and pitcher.
Finally, another person having his share of problems in Athletic News
Publicity Director Don Liehendorfer. Soon after Christmas he began re
ceiving the long string of requests by the publishers of the football an
nuals. They were sent a list of probable offensive and defensive starting
lineups for 1953, three deep.
Now that the new rule change has been put in, he can start looking
for the same magazine publishers to'start work all over again. And, as
Liebendorfer himself says, "How can I say what the lineups will be when
the coach doesn't have the vaguest notion himself?"
