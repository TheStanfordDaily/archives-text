"The unchanging East is
changing and has changed,"
declared Professor James Mc-
Bain to the large audience gath
ered in Memorial Auditorium
for his "Mission to India" Tues
day Evening Series lecture.
Dr. Mcßain. who for six years
was director of India's largest
chemical laboratory, said the pur
pose of his mission was to combat
poverty, disease, and primitive ag
riculture. According to Mcßain,
' this task "succeeded beyond hope."
He helped to build, stock, and di
rect the biggest research center in
Ana to work on these problems.
Land, water, babies, cows, and
c£ pita I are India's greatest prob
lems. Professor Mcßain said. "India
is the largest non - commercial
country in the world, though she
supplies some of our critical and
strategic imports. She is the sec
ond largest movie producing coun
try in the world, yet her industry
is still dominated by the colonial
system, he explained.
"Through the work of the new
research center this can now be
changed. Projects started at the
laboratory arc not left in the aca
demic test-tube stage; they are
completed and produced in large
scale quantity," Mcßain asserted.
Dr. Mcßain summarized the pol
icy of India and of Prime Minister
| Jawaharlal Nehru by referring to
| George Washington's farewell ad
| dress: "peace, commerce, and
I friendly relations."
