LONDON, Feb. 4 (UP)â€”Secretary of State John Foster Dulles
leportedly told Prime Minister Winston Churchill today that the
United States is determined to adopt a positive approach toward
ending the Korean war.
Dulles informed Churchill that President Eisenhower's new ad-

ministration intends to follow a
positive line despite open British
fears about the freeing of Chinese
Nationalist troops on Formosa, ac
cording to highly placed British
sources.
Dulles and Mutual Security Ad
ministrator Harold E. St ass en
wound up their London visit with a
conference-packed day despite the
clamor of British protest over the
President's Formosa move. Their
schedule included talks with
Churchill, Foreign Secretary An

chequer R. A. Butler, and other
British military and diplomatic of
ficials.
Dulles ended his London con

than even chance of success.
Dulles arrived in Britain while
Eden was telling the House of
Commons that tTie United Kingdom
protested against the decision to
free Nationalist Chinese troops for
attacks on the Communist mainland
of China. Eden told Commons the
British government felt that the
decision would have "unfortuante
political" results "without compen

British newspapers were almost
unanimous in criticizing President
Eisenhower's decision, but Dulles
found the Churchill government
less perturbed than might have
been expected.
