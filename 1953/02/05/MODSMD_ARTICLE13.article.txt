# Price Reduction Denied Freshmen
## 
### 
Fifty per cent reduction in the
price of tickets to the Frosh-Soph
"Hat Dance" tomorrow night, which
was earlier offered to holders of
freshman class cards, has been
canceled, freshman president
Ritchie Taylor announced yester
day.
Taylor said that such a reduction
in ticket price cannot be made be
cause the sophomore class, which
is sponsoring the dance, cannot re
quire class cards of all those who
wish to attend the dance, and thus
the freshman class is not in a posi
tion to offer such reductions.
