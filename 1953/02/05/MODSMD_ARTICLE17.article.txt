PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT — During one of the Stanford Fire Department's weekly drills,
Capt. Joseph Prusia shows Rod Gibson how to adjust one of the department's new "Mystery
Nozzles." The nozzles, described as "glorified garden hoses," can shoot a straight stream of
water or give off a fan-shaped flow. Each Saturday during the guarter the fourteen student fire
men are drilled in the use of such eguipment as ladders, hoses, small fire fighting apparatus, and
resuscitation inhalatiorf and gas mask work. The department serves Stanford and the adjacent
area and is prepared to fight anything from a small grass fire to a large conflagration. For more
