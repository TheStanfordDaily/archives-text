# 'You and I' Poses Dilemma Of Art Versus Practicality
## 
### MARY FRAZER 
"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation . . . and modern
businessmen die of market reports and hardening of the soul . . ."
Presenting the dilemma of a choice between the artistic and
practical life, Phillip Barry's "You and I" opened a four-day run
in the Little Theater of Mem Aud last night.

Maitland White's successful busi
ness career eclipses his early artistic
promise. He has married, raised a
family, and became a soap-and-tooth
paste tycoon instead of haunting the
Left Bank in beret arid smock.
The sudden visit of a successful
literary friend, plus the complications
of White's son's desire to study archi
tecture abroad, bring the desire for
an Artistic life back to him. The
denoument of the situation is both
touching and amusing. Arthur Fish
er as Maitland White is excellent.
Outstanding in the cast is Suzy
Marion, whose gamin face and
broad wit make much of a stock
maid-role.
Maurice Warner as "Geoffrey,"
the visiting author, is convincing.
His disillusionment with artistic
insecurity is posed against White's
hunger for creativity in (he essen
tially humdrum world of factories
and machines.
Barry's play presents a sound
problem in human values, one that
could bear more than his almost too
light treatment. The play is amus
ing, however, and moves quickly un
der the able direction of F. Cowles
Strickland.
In addition to Fisher and Miss
Marion, the cast includes Nancy
Simms, Jack Frakfcs, Elizabeth Janss,
and Milton Cohen. Repeat perform
ances will be given tonight, tomor
row, and Saturday at 8:l. r > in the
Little Theater.
Tickets are on sale at the Little
Theater Box Office for $1 00.


IT'S RIGHT THERE—Jack Frakes, as Roderick White, points
out to Veronica Duane, played by Nancy Simms, some of his
sketches. The two are playing in the Stanford Players' version
of "You and I," which opened last night. The play continues
through Saturday in the Little Theater. Curtain time is 8:15.
