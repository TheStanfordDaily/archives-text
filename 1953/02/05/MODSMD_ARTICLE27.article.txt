# BULL SESSION
## Embarrassing Moments 
### SAM FRESHMAN 
Every Stanford i-ough has been hit to some degree
or another by the high cost of living. Only one last
vestige of the "good old days" remains and that's
rellar coffee. It's so bad these days (high prices) that
students are borrowing money from professors (and
everybody knows how poor they are), a group of Phi
Delts have had to put their famous limousine on the
market, and the Guild Theatre has given up the ghost
(we haven't been able to find out what's playing there

since they stopped running ads
in the DAILY six months ago).
The ratio here may be in favor
of girls but the old allowance isn't.
But don't despair men. where
there's a will there's a way! The
answer is (brace yourself) not
free love but free dates (the free
Love question will be discussed in
a future column after I receive
my diploma).
Perhaps those of you who have

had the misfortune to have been born into a wealthy
family don't know exactly what a free date is. A
free date is a prearranged meeting between two in
dividuals of opposite (preferably) sexes which does
not cost either one anything( in the way of money,
that is). Free dates are an old custom in ' many
places and they should definitely become one of Stan
ford's newest traditions to take their place next to
such hallowed Farm folkways as the lonely women
rule, and the no bicycling on inner Quad tradition.
For those who are at a loss as to what to do on
a free date may 1 suggest a quickee three unit course

in anatomy? For those who are bored with the usual
type of free date there are several suggestions open.
Among the no-charge-for-admission events are the
quarterly band and orchestra concerts. For something
really novel and out of the ordinary you might sug
gest the Tuesday Evening Series (although I wouldn't
advise doing this more than once). If you know the
girl well, the "Marriage and the Family" series of the
YWCA might be enlightening to both of you. The
real trick to this sort of thing is to cultivate mutual
interests between yourself and your date in things
that are inexpensive to do.
Another good pastime to develop besides going
to lectures is "party crashing." This is extremely
inexpensive and can prove to he a great deal of
fun. The DAILY, lIR, QUAD, and KZSU have so
many on their stall's that not even the wheels in
these groups know every member of their respec
tive organizations, soft's always safe to crash their
affairs.
You might start your party agenda by next week
slipping in on the Stern party (there's always a Stern
party going on), and to then try the Military Ball as
General Mac-Arthur (he doesn't have to buy .a ticket).
The list is endless and no doubt you will be able to
make your own little adaptations of the party "game."
Other inexpensive dates are going to the beach
(any beach), tennis, golf (on the Stanford course),
and "indoor" sports.
Now that I've given you a few suggestions the rest
is up to you. Go to it men and remember the guy
who said you can't get something for nothing never
heard of Yankee (or Stanford) ingenuity.

Delts have had to put their famous limousine on the
market, and the Guild Theatre has given up the ghost
(we haven't been able to find out what's playing there

since they stopped running ads
in the DAILY six months ago).
The ratio here may be in favor
of girls but the old allowance isn't.
But don't despair men. where
there's a will there's a way! The
answer is (brace yourself) not
free love but free dates (the free
Love question will be discussed in
a future column after I receive
my diploma).
Perhaps those of you who have

had the misfortune to have been born into a wealthy
family don't know exactly what a free date is. A
free date is a prearranged meeting between two in
dividuals of opposite (preferably) sexes which does
not cost either one anything( in the way of money,
that is). Free dates are an old custom in ' many
places and they should definitely become one of Stan
ford's newest traditions to take their place next to
such hallowed Farm folkways as the lonely women
rule, and the no bicycling on inner Quad tradition.
For those who are at a loss as to what to do on
a free date may 1 suggest a quickee three unit course

in anatomy? For those who are bored with the usual
type of free date there are several suggestions open.
Among the no-charge-for-admission events are the
quarterly band and orchestra concerts. For something
really novel and out of the ordinary you might sug
gest the Tuesday Evening Series (although I wouldn't
advise doing this more than once). If you know the
girl well, the "Marriage and the Family" series of the
YWCA might be enlightening to both of you. The
real trick to this sort of thing is to cultivate mutual
interests between yourself and your date in things
that are inexpensive to do.
Another good pastime to develop besides going
to lectures is "party crashing." This is extremely
inexpensive and can prove to he a great deal of
fun. The DAILY, lIR, QUAD, and KZSU have so
many on their stall's that not even the wheels in
these groups know every member of their respec
tive organizations, soft's always safe to crash their
affairs.
You might start your party agenda by next week
slipping in on the Stern party (there's always a Stern
party going on), and to then try the Military Ball as
General Mac-Arthur (he doesn't have to buy .a ticket).
The list is endless and no doubt you will be able to
make your own little adaptations of the party "game."
Other inexpensive dates are going to the beach
(any beach), tennis, golf (on the Stanford course),
and "indoor" sports.
Now that I've given you a few suggestions the rest
is up to you. Go to it men and remember the guy
who said you can't get something for nothing never
heard of Yankee (or Stanford) ingenuity.

Every Stanford i-ough has been hit to some degree
or another by the high cost of living. Only one last
vestige of the "good old days" remains and that's
rellar coffee. It's so bad these days (high prices) that
students are borrowing money from professors (and
everybody knows how poor they are), a group of Phi
Delts have had to put their famous limousine on the
market, and the Guild Theatre has given up the ghost
(we haven't been able to find out what's playing there
