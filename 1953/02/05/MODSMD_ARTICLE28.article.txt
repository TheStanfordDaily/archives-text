## Turn Off the Carillon 
### 
To the Editor:
Tuesday you printed a friendly editorial inviting
everyone to air his gripes. Mr. Ron Mardigian wrote
a letter compaining about something that is very high
on the list of quite a few peopleâ€”the Carillons. All
he got for his efforts was'a very mediocre attempt by
you to make him look like a fool, but it appears to me
that your efforts boomeranged.
There's one thing about a radio that has made it
one of the most blessed contrivances ever invented
by man: if you don't like it, you can turn it off. Un
fortunately the H(>9ver Tower Carillons don't have
this desirable attribute.
If you don't believe there is a substantial number
of students who are sincere in their complaints, I
suggest you take five minutes off from your own
blaring radio next Sunday afternoon and come down
to the library to see the expression on the faces of
those who are trying to study under more serene cir
cumstances than described by you.
Very truly yours,
JOHN R. COHAN
