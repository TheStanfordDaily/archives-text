# India's National Language

To the Editor:
In his address Tuesday in the Tuesday Series, Dr.
Mcßain made a surprising observation on India's
national language, describing India's desire to have
Hindi as her national language as born out of narrow
patriotism and provincialism.
Hardly 12 percent of India's population can read
and write. Granting that if all of these know English,
we are left with the remaining 88 percent who do
not know English, who cannot read and write in any
language, but can speak one or the other of the
numerous Indian languages. About 40 percent spenk

Hindi. If, in the interests of her unified development
and cultural advancement, it is desirable for present
day India to have a common language, understood
throughout her length and breadth, the natural choice
is Hindi, not English.
While Hindi becomes the national language, there
is enough vision in India—which has produced some
fine writers and speakers in the English language,
like Tagore and Nehru—to see that English is re
tained in a place of importance, both on account of
the association of India's intelligentsia with the Eng
lish language, as well as India's position in the com
munity of nations.
To require India not to develop a common language
of her own and to retain English in its place for all
time, is no more logical than to ask France and Ger
many, for instance, to give up Frenth and German,
in favor of English.
