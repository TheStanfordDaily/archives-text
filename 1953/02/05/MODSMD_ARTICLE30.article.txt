# Thanks for the Books
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Th<" Berlin Affiliation Committee of the lIR last
quarter conducted a Token of Friendship Book Drive
to further our relations with the Free University.
Members of the faculty who had written books were
asked to donate copies and autograph them to that
institution. In this way we hoped not only to make
a worthwhile addition to Berlin's library, but also to
give something that was really of Stanford.
The project was a great success, and at the be
ginning of January over fifty books were sent off to
Germany. On behalf of the committee I would like
thank all those professors and others who helped us
in our drive.
Sincerely
KEITH NELSON
Chairman, Berlin Affiliation Comm.
