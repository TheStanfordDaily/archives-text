On a chair in the corner he sits,
with his head bowed. He is silent,
but all around nim he hears the
sounds of music and laughter and
games. He does not join in him
self, but he hears and is glad.
This man is one of the mentally
ill at Agnew State Hospital near
San Jose, and he is watching a spe
cial weekend project, for the Amer
ican Friends (Quaker) Service
Committee has come to do volun
teer work with the patients.
Twice each month Stanford
Students may take part in this
project. A "typical weekend he
gins on Friday night at the youth
hostel near Hidden Villa Ranch
in Los Altos. For about $4 the
student receives his lodging and
food for the weekend.
They are a varied group: stu
dents, social workers, mailmen,
teachers, and librarians take part.
These volunteers receive orienta
tion regarding the hospital set-up,
behavior, and attitudes toward the
patients.
Ward work begins on Saturday
morning, with six-man teams each
visiting a different ward every
hour. With the 40 or 50 patients in
a ward, the volunteers talk, play
ball, checkers, or ring-toss, or play
records and dance.

Most of the patients respond to
this friendly interest; even those
who sit with bowed heads along
the walls are aware that there are
visitors, laughter, and music.
Last weekend, one reticent pa
tient said again and again, "God
bless you for coming. I'll remem
ber this as long as I live. Please,
please come again."
Ward work lasts until late after
noon, when the group returns to
the hostel for dinner and a social
evening together. Sunday morn
ing hospital work begins with a
hymn service which patients are
invited to join. The day ends at 4
p.m., when the volunteers return
home.
The Friends' Service weekends
are open to people of an.y age and
any relig'ous belief. For details,
call Kay Allen at Storey House, or
write directly to Mrs. Pauline Hen
derson, 1830 Sutter Street, San
Francisco. The Friends' next week
end open to student participation
will be from Feb. 13 to 15.
