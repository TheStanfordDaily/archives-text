# Dealing the Cards
## Track and Troy—'53 Try 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
Out on Angell Field, the place where Stanford trackmen spend most of
their working time, a dark, serious looking man who passes under the
name of Jack Weiershauser is coaching along a group of boys that he hopes
will succeed in doing what no StanMrd or any other track team has been
able to do since 19153—beat the University of Southern California.
"Has it been so long?" the old timers may ask, recalling the great days
when Ben Eastman and the rest were leading their teams on to victories
over the hated men of Troy. And it has been a long time. The reasons
why we haven't won are many, and have been hashed over ad nauseum.
The main reason lor our singular lack of success against this one par
ticular team is, of course, the continual high level of athletes "retained"
by USC. They are deep and they are good. And then again, we are blessed
with the Stanford jinx that always pops up two days before the SC fracas.
In 1949 Stanford was loaded and so was Troy. But the jinx was there
and the Stanfords had a had day and the Trojans ran wild "in our own
stadium. In 1950 the Trojans were really loaded, hut Stanford and iron
man Gay Bryan looked awful nice. It doped out so that (Jay would take
21 points in the sprints, lows, high jump, and hroad jump. The day before
the team flew down Bryan wrecked his leg and wrecked the teams chances
of victory with it. If the big fellow had taken those points, Stanford would
have come home the winner.
Kill Dry That Starting Tear
The tales of woe can go on forever, but let's not cry so hard the ink
will smudge. Stanford is not a ghost team living on thoughts of past deeds—
Stanford is a track team that could on any given day whip the scivies off
Coach Jess Mortanson's Trojans. This year, for the first time since God and
Dean Cromwell know when, the Trojans aren't three deep in every event.
For a fact, they are zero deep in some events. On the other side of the
ledger. Stanford has someone in everything, and good boys to boot. For
a little dividend, on the surface it would seem that there is more hope
for improvement where it counts on Stanford's side than on USC's.
In the 1(10 we have Maury Parsons with a 9.8, Boh McGee with a 9.7
clocked off against San Jose St. last year before he hurt his leg, and
Keith Brownsberger who was hurt most of last year hut shows great
promise in both the 220 and the l(i(). Parsons has a 21.5 to his credit in
the furlong, and Brownsberger, with a 21.4 in high school, could he a
potential 21 man. USC has Gable in both sprints who can crack better
than even time if he's lucky, while Davis, their great hurler, and Lea,
their top 440 man each have 21 2 bests, better than anything Stanford
can post.
Weak in the Quarter, Strong in the Half
In the middle distances, Lea (47.5), Handrix (48.5), and Sorgen (48.2)
all post better times than Stanford's Fred George (48.8), Bill Friedrichs
(48.9), Rich Black (50.), and Wafter Garrett (50.1) in the 440. Black and
Garrett are both sophs and can improve, but this has to go down in the
books as being one of SC's stronger events. In the 880, Montgomery, their
best all-round distance man, has been declared ineligible for scholastic
reasons (at SC, amazing!!!) which should make this open field lor Stanford's
Bob Simon (1:55.2), Dave Fletcher (1:58.5 and moving up), and Frosty
Philips (1:59.4 with room for improvement here).
In the distance pulls, Stanford should have firsts in the mile on Simon's
4:12.8 and first in the two mile on Bob Reed's 9:42.4 set last year as a
freshman. He also clocked off a 4:18.6 mile, but whether or not he can
do as well while running the two mile is another story. He should be good
for a third, anyhow. USC's best after Ferguson in the mile is Root at
4:20. doubles in the two mile with a best of 9:44. For Stanford. Russ
Ferguson (relationship doubted) has a 10:08.3 and should be good for many
points through the season.
In the hurdles we hate to look. The only man standing in the way of
their dominating both events is a fellow named Bob Mathias. Bob has
a 14.2 in this country but shocked everyone when the 200 pound full
hack skimmed the high sticks in 13.8 at Zurich, Switzerland. Quoth
Bob, "I was just in the best condition of my life after the Olympic Games."
Jerry Wood, second man for Stanford with 14.7 best in the highs, is good
enough to place against almost any team but SC. Davis and Wright have
a 13.7 and 14.4 respectively. Davis usually isn't that good, however,
and on a given day Davis vs. Mathias could be very interesting. In the
lows, Bob's 3.9 and Marty Johnson's 21.1 don't quite hold up to Davis's
23. and 23.3 (what, those two again?).
Now to the field events: SC has Sorgen in the broadjump at 23' 11%",
Stanford lias Pete McKay at 23' 7Vfe", Loren Sorenson at 22' 6V4", and Jim

Seebold at 22' VV' but with lots of room for improvement.
In the pole vault we "ain't got nuttin'!" Best of the lot is Mathias, who
probably won't jump, at 13' 1". Next comes Dick Jaqua with a 12' G" and
Jim Stephens with 10' 6". USC has two (count them, two) 13' 9" vaulters
in Sanduski and Cox. Oh the shame of it all!
In the high jump they have nothing after Ronquilo, who has crossed the
bar at 6' 5%", but 'we have nothing before him. Top man is Nas Fishback
at 6' 3V/', Wes Fry at 6' 3", Bob Mathias (what, him again?) at 6' 2%", and
John Crowder at G' 1".
Javelin Sole Strength in the Field
In the Javelin, Stanford has easily its strongest event. Led by Leo Long
with a best of 211-5, followed by Bob Kimball, 205-11, Chuck Harlow,

IS4-11, and Mathias with 194-3. At SC, this is one of their weakest events,
and probably won't be able to crack the top four.
In the Shot, Howie Hertz at 53' 8" and Boh Mathias at 51' 1" must
compete against O'Brien at 57' 3%" and Van Doren at 52' Va". O'Brien, the
Olympic champ, could make it quite a bind. Their other Olympic champ,
Sim Iness and his 183' 5W discus heave should take all the marbles
against Mathias and Chuck Renfro, with bests of 173' 4'" and 166" respec
tively. Backing up Iness is O'Brien and Desmond Koch, their punter in
football, with 170' 4V2" and 166' 3".
Give the relay to SC, dope it out on a sheet of paper, and darn if they
don't win again, 67-64. If we don't make up those three points, we'll just
have to wait for next year. SC is too much in the top events to try and
take in the PCC meet. Whoops, there we go crying again, but don't you
think Jack Weiershauser and his cronies aren't racking their brains and
local PE classes for those three points.
