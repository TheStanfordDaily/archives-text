terested in representing such di
verse parts of the world as the
Arab nations and Israel, the USSR,
Germany, and Austria.
The agenda committee, headed by
Alan Thompson, has worked out a
series of four discussion meetings
for the conference. In the first se
ries the delegates (who will come
from more than 60 college and uni
versity groups) will meet in groups
of 15 to 20 to discuss a small geo
graphical area in detail. Professors
from the History, Political Science,
and Economics departments will
lead the discussions.
The second series will expand the
original area of discussion to such
topics as "NATO and Western Eu
rope" and"The Far East." In this
series, the groups will be composed
of combinations of delegates from
the smaller groups, and will be be

tween 40 and 60 in number.
Similar lines will be followed
for the third series, although the
groups will be shifted in order to
give the delegates a chance to
discuss the major policy areas
with "experts" from all countries.
In the final discussion meeting,
the emphasis will be shifted from
geographical to functional aspects
of our foreign policy. The topics
will be along the lines of "Economic

and Political Aspects of American
Foreign Policy."
A plenary session will be held
on Saturday, at which time spokes
men from each of the smaller dis
cussion groups will sum up their
findings before the entire confer
ence. In this way, the agenda com
mittee hopes that the delegates will
be presented with an integrated
view of American foreign policy.
In addition to the schedule of
discussion meetings, the conference

will include a reception Thursday
evening, at which Norman Stines,
former First Secretary of the Unit
