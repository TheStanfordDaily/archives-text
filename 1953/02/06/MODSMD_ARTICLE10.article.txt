# Evicted African Tells His Story
## 
### BARBARA TUERK 
A stocky dark brown man in a dark-brown suit sat in the "Y"
Lounge Wednesday noon and told the story he had come 5,000
miles to tell.
To the British, it is a question of how best to develop and use
the rich resources of Central Africa. To Kirili Jahnel it looks like

the story of 78,000 East Africans ♦
moved to make room for 13 white
men.
Kirili came to New York from
Tanganyika, British trust territory
in East Africa, to plead his people's
case before the United Nations'
Trusteeship Council and General
Assembly. What will he do, now
that the U.N. has not found an an
swer for his people's problem? He
just doesn't know.
Right now, he is enrolled at San
Jose State as a "special" student.
Kirili's trek really began over
a year ago, when the British gov
ernment decided to develop the
land occupied by his tribe, the
Wa-Meru, and the tribe refused
to move.
"Resist? No," the African said
with a shrug. "We didn't want war.
We just went and sat under the
trees."
But sitting wasn't enough, he re
members. "The British moved in
with guns, fire, and trucks. They
burned our huts, killed our live
stock, shot our people. Then they
moved us onto bad land — land
without water."
The Merit Citizens' Union, of
which Kirili is general secretary,
began by petitioning the Brit
ish Colonial Secretary for redress.
The British replied by offering
the Wa-Merits compensation for
their land.
"But this we didn't want," Kirili
said.
The Wa-Merus then decided to
send Kirili to the U.N. to state his
case. Raising the money was diffi
cult, but it was only half the prob
lem.
"1 have many troubles," he said,
in tlie halting English he learned
only two months ago. "No pass
port. then no visa, then they say
the U.N. meeting is all over."
The Wa-Meru persevered, and

in July Kirili arrived in New
York. The Trusteeship Council,
first U.N. agency to hear bis case,
agreed to give compensation for
the lost lands, but refused to re
turn them.
Next the African turned to the
General Assembly's Fourth Com
mittee in charge of trusteeships.
•This committee passed a resolution
returning the lands to the Wa-
Meru. Kirili cabled his people that
it was only a question of time, that
the lands would be returned as
soon as the whole Assembly met.
That was last November. The
Assembly met last week, and the
I resolution was rejected. Voting for
it were Russia, her satellites, and
most Middle Eastern, South Ameri
can. and recently colonial countries.
Voting against it were the colonial
powers, the British Commonwealth
members, and the United States.
Why? Kirili answers this ques
tion with another cynical shrug.
"The British representative," he
tries to explain, "says that .ve're
agitators — Communists. Comtno -
nist? What does this mean? Wc
want our land bark. So I'm an
agitator — a Communist. I don't
even know what the word
means."
"In New York I talk to some
one," he continued. "We have a
good talk; everything he says is
good. Then people come to me.
Don't talk to him, they say. He's a
Communist. He's bad. How should
I tell?"
He said the British delegate ar
gued that his government wouldn't
put the resolution into effect even
if it were passed, so why pass it?
Kirili shrugs again when asked
what he'll do now. "My people
write me, when is help coming?
What can I say? I write them.
'Don't make war. Keep things as

they are- Wr l<>sr our 'attic. our
our land. We ran only
fry for education."
He himself plans now to find
some way to stay in this country
to continue his own education
(which ended in the eighth grade
when his missionary teachers were
jailed), and to look for some means
of establishing scholarships with
which to bring his countrymen to
school in this country.
"Education—our people are hun
gry for it,"he said passionately.
"We have no schools, just one uni
versity for 18 million blacks. The
schools go only to grades four, five,
or six."
Kirili believes (hat his people
could govern themselves tomor
row, if they received independ
ence. But, he said, "we would

want the help of all «»ifier peo
ple,. Without friends it would
take a long time."
And he had no concrete plans fo
organizing hi*.; country economi
tally, for compeiv -ding the Priti
settlers now holding 09-yoai-b ase:
or for educating enough African
quickly to insure a stable govern
men I.
And in the mnnl.ime? Kirili jn:
doesn't, know. "I'm afraid c
trouble—like in Kenya, he saic
"My people are hungry, they'r
i sufTcring. We are a rich countn
but new our riches arc only fo
I the whites."
"My people don't want war," h
concluded. "But waiting and wait
: ing is hard on men. How long ca
iwe wait? I don't know . . . Onl
I God can help us now."
