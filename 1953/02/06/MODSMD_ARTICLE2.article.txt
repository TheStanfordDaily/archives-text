States is not planning to extend the Far Eastern war to the Chinese
mainland.
"I would like to say first that it is important not to read into the

President's statement anything
more than it actually says," Edeh
declared.
"President Eisenhower has made
it clear that the Seventh Fleet
could no longer he employed to
shelter Communist China. He
went on to use these words, 'This
order implies no aggressive in
tent on our part'."
Eden also said he was sure the
United States understood that the
Communists were trying to pin
down U.S. forces in the Far East
and thus weaken the strength of
the West "in the essential theater—
which is Europe."

cialist Foreign Secretary Herbert
Morrison warned that the United
States could not expect any Brit

lations had been established in
