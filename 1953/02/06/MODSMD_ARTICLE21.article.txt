# The 						Seventh Fleet Move: A Gamble
## 
### 
Any doubts remaining in the minds of the
American people on the specifics of President
Eisenhower's political program seem to have
been boldly erased by his State of the Union
message last Monday.
Now the first flood of comments, expressed
almost as a reflex action over the announce
ment to remove the U.S. Seventh Fleet from
its neutralizing duty, has died away. We'd like
to attempt some reflections on that action.
To us, Eisenhower's orders, which will re
move any impingement of the Seventh Fleet
on Chiang Kai-shek's activities, seem like a cal
culated gamble, a realistic attempt to break a
terrible stalemate.
The United States seern3 to be caught in a
giant nutcracker in its relations with China.
On the one hand the United States is at war
with the masked troops of the Chinese Com
munists, and justly refuses to recognize the
inhumanlike dictatorship that is enslaving the
China mainland.
On the other hand, the Formosa Chinese un
der Ihe anachronistic rule of Generalissimo
Chiang are willing to accept our aid and alli
ance in what seems to be a guixotic attempt
to regain their mainland.
Neither of the choices could follow from our
expressed political philosophy.
Yet the problem in Korea is far more serious.
There seems little to prevent the slaughter
from going on ad infinitum during the present
military stalemate. Even if the UN could mount

a successful full-scale offensive, it seems the
better part of diplomatic wisdom not to do so.
The idea behind Eisenhower's move seems
to be an attempt to break the stalemate by
weakening the Communists (they will now
have to defend their coastline) rather than in
creasing our aggressiveness.
Granted that Chiang cannot attack now, the
Chinese coast, unprotected by the Seventh
Fleet, is nevertheless open to attack by (a
coroner's phrase) "person or persons un
known."
Many observers, especially representatives
pf other dbuntries, label the move as openly
aggressive, ft will bring on the third World
War, they say.
Along this line, we fail to see why Eisen
hower didn't keep the muzzle on Chiang. The
President.is a military man. He must know that
the Formosans cannot launch a full-scale inva
sion, and that nuisance attacks may dissipate
the defensive strength Chiang lias assembled
on the island.
Perhaps the answer is that the administra
tion feels any nuisance attacks would provide
some return on its great investment in military
aid. Time will tell.
Our feeling is that Ihe chances lie in favor
of the gamble succeeding: the chances of a
weakened Communist position in Korea are
greater than a large-scale military action in
volving the Reds, the Formosans, the U.S., and
possibly the rest of the world.
