Stanford University is a school of broken dates and
.shattered dreams. It is a school of blighted hopes
and empty beer bottles. It is a school of lont. girls
where any kid with gold in his pocket and the time
to hang around the Cellar can make a pickup in no
lime flat and buy some hot tea over the counter with
out a cop taking notice and with "Red" Weismann
running the show from a smoke filled room on the
second floor.
Not all the kids who hang around the? Cellar are
drifters, operators, Comies, Corn-men, wallet-dippers,
sharpies, and clip-artists, but don't make book on
anyone you see there. Give them a moments con
fidence and they're inside the dive, drinking the coffee,
and you're picking up the tab. (The coffee deals are
made inside the cellar with a guy named "Yuks"

Meyer getting a good 10 percent
of the take. In a little room right
next to the cellar you can pick
up the "right brand" of smokes
over the counter. And Estes De
fa uver knows it. More later on
the ties between Defauver, "Red"
Weismann, and some guy known
only as "Wally.")
HIE OPEN DOOR POLICY
If you're alive and know the
are of spades from the corpse

yard, it won't take you long to find out that all the
doors at I.S.II! are open. You walk in through the
front door. That's what we did. We picked up the
• urtain on this school. We wanted the facts. The
facts are lowdown, the inside of the story, bawdy,
hot, sexy, vulgar—well, that's what we were horn
for, to pick up the hot and sexy.
First there are the big halls where the "doses" are
given out. The guys that pick up their juice from the
first tray are the guys in the know. And it doesn't
; top at juice, either, the tea at the end isn't straight
T« nderlief. And bow does the juice get on the tray?
Everyone knows and nobedy says, but we are in a
position to tell you, confidential that it comes from
way up- the "hashers" are just paid stooges. The big
gun behind the works is Shirl Brewer, or someone
that looks very much like her—and don't think the
Union doesn't know it.
THE lIOT SPOTS
There's one spot that even the wise ones around
the Cellar don't talk about. It's a little room with
a black door on the left as you go down into the dive.
You can see the guys in the know go in, and we went
right in with them. The things we saw can't l>e de
f ciibed here, even in a book like this, but the things

that go on in there are known by the Biology De
partment.
And the girls that hang around the Cellar. Every
American will he shocked when we tell them that
fi(l% of (he girls that hang around the Cellar par
take in the hot stuff sold across the counter for only
5a shot. And it isn't good stuff, either.
ON THE MAKE
And they don't, stop there. Take this young chick
Armadine Giraff. Armadine is pretty loose and you
can strike up a confab with the doll for a quick
invested in the right stuff. And if sjte's booked up
solid, she can get you what you're looking for. For
a price she'll give you a list of numbers. We paid.
Just call DA 3-5171, DA 3-3151, DA 3-8703. Ask for
"R.A." and tell them "Sponsor" sent you. They can
get you what you want.
For really hot numbers, call a place that uses
the dodge, "Women's Rest Home." Ask for the fever
ward, they don't ask questions . . . the number is
DA 3-11417 and ask for Murphy. And all this takes
place iust 3.128 miles from the White House!
Hang around the Cellar for seven hours, look like
you want company, and the odds are eight to five
you'll be approached.
Here's the act. Blossom LeJones comes up and says,
"Hey Mac, who ya got for civ?"
You look around and say, "What d'ya take me for,
kid, I finished up that stuff before I got my first set
of long pants!"
Blossom picks you right up. She figures you for
either upper division and in the know, or a young
punk freshman who's loaded old man just came
through with his (i»st pair of longies.
If .you're interested in entertainment, some pri
vate "football" pics are run every Sunday night in
a little place on Serra St. For only 'HH you see them
they way you want to see them.
THE COM RING
Behind all the sordid doings of the Cellar and the
Row "Houses" are the corn-men, many of them ex
coms. Tip for the cops: Fi i: k Bull Seshman. He leads
an organization known as the Axe Society. It's com
posed of ex-axe murderers and is the Murder, Inc.
of the ASSU. Most of the bruinwork behind the or
ganization comes from "Clutch" Alexander. He and
the boys in their smoke-filled room on the third floor
are responsible for much of the dirty work that goes
on around the campus.
Well, there it is: Stanford University, hot, bawdy,
rough, sizzling, sexy, brash, torrid, temptuous, lewd,
lurid, rancid, with its gyp-and-clip Cellar "bee" girls,
its juice and tea concessions, its Row Houses. It's all
yours tha way it really is because that's the way we
brought it to'you confidential!!!

Union doesn't know it.
THE lIOT SPOTS
There's one spot that even the wise ones around
the Cellar don't talk about. It's a little room with
a black door on the left as you go down into the dive.
You can see the guys in the know go in, and we went
right in with them. The things we saw can't l>e de
f ciibed here, even in a book like this, but the things

that go on in there are known by the Biology De
partment.
And the girls that hang around the Cellar. Every
American will he shocked when we tell them that
fi(l% of (he girls that hang around the Cellar par
take in the hot stuff sold across the counter for only
5a shot. And it isn't good stuff, either.
ON THE MAKE
And they don't, stop there. Take this young chick
Armadine Giraff. Armadine is pretty loose and you
can strike up a confab with the doll for a quick
invested in the right stuff. And if sjte's booked up
solid, she can get you what you're looking for. For
a price she'll give you a list of numbers. We paid.
Just call DA 3-5171, DA 3-3151, DA 3-8703. Ask for
"R.A." and tell them "Sponsor" sent you. They can
get you what you want.
For really hot numbers, call a place that uses
the dodge, "Women's Rest Home." Ask for the fever
ward, they don't ask questions . . . the number is
DA 3-11417 and ask for Murphy. And all this takes
place iust 3.128 miles from the White House!
Hang around the Cellar for seven hours, look like
you want company, and the odds are eight to five
you'll be approached.
Here's the act. Blossom LeJones comes up and says,
"Hey Mac, who ya got for civ?"
You look around and say, "What d'ya take me for,
kid, I finished up that stuff before I got my first set
of long pants!"
Blossom picks you right up. She figures you for
either upper division and in the know, or a young
punk freshman who's loaded old man just came
through with his (i»st pair of longies.
If .you're interested in entertainment, some pri
vate "football" pics are run every Sunday night in
a little place on Serra St. For only 'HH you see them
they way you want to see them.
THE COM RING
Behind all the sordid doings of the Cellar and the
Row "Houses" are the corn-men, many of them ex
coms. Tip for the cops: Fi i: k Bull Seshman. He leads
an organization known as the Axe Society. It's com
posed of ex-axe murderers and is the Murder, Inc.
of the ASSU. Most of the bruinwork behind the or
ganization comes from "Clutch" Alexander. He and
the boys in their smoke-filled room on the third floor
are responsible for much of the dirty work that goes
on around the campus.
Well, there it is: Stanford University, hot, bawdy,
rough, sizzling, sexy, brash, torrid, temptuous, lewd,
lurid, rancid, with its gyp-and-clip Cellar "bee" girls,
its juice and tea concessions, its Row Houses. It's all
yours tha way it really is because that's the way we
brought it to'you confidential!!!

Stanford University is a school of broken dates and
.shattered dreams. It is a school of blighted hopes
and empty beer bottles. It is a school of lont. girls
where any kid with gold in his pocket and the time
to hang around the Cellar can make a pickup in no
lime flat and buy some hot tea over the counter with
out a cop taking notice and with "Red" Weismann
running the show from a smoke filled room on the
second floor.
Not all the kids who hang around the? Cellar are
drifters, operators, Comies, Corn-men, wallet-dippers,
sharpies, and clip-artists, but don't make book on
anyone you see there. Give them a moments con
fidence and they're inside the dive, drinking the coffee,
and you're picking up the tab. (The coffee deals are
made inside the cellar with a guy named "Yuks"

Meyer getting a good 10 percent
of the take. In a little room right
next to the cellar you can pick
up the "right brand" of smokes
over the counter. And Estes De
fa uver knows it. More later on
the ties between Defauver, "Red"
Weismann, and some guy known
only as "Wally.")
HIE OPEN DOOR POLICY
If you're alive and know the

• urtain on this school. We wanted the facts. The
facts are lowdown, the inside of the story, bawdy,
hot, sexy, vulgar—well, that's what we were horn
for, to pick up the hot and sexy.
First there are the big halls where the "doses" are
given out. The guys that pick up their juice from the
first tray are the guys in the know. And it doesn't
; top at juice, either, the tea at the end isn't straight
T« nderlief. And bow does the juice get on the tray?
Everyone knows and nobedy says, but we are in a
position to tell you, confidential that it comes from
way up- the "hashers" are just paid stooges. The big

they way you want to see them.
THE COM RING
Behind all the sordid doings of the Cellar and the
Row "Houses" are the corn-men, many of them ex
coms. Tip for the cops: Fi i: k Bull Seshman. He leads
an organization known as the Axe Society. It's com
posed of ex-axe murderers and is the Murder, Inc.
of the ASSU. Most of the bruinwork behind the or
ganization comes from "Clutch" Alexander. He and
the boys in their smoke-filled room on the third floor
are responsible for much of the dirty work that goes
on around the campus.
Well, there it is: Stanford University, hot, bawdy,
rough, sizzling, sexy, brash, torrid, temptuous, lewd,
lurid, rancid, with its gyp-and-clip Cellar "bee" girls,
its juice and tea concessions, its Row Houses. It's all
yours tha way it really is because that's the way we
brought it to'you confidential!!!

Stanford University is a school of broken dates and
.shattered dreams. It is a school of blighted hopes
and empty beer bottles. It is a school of lont. girls
where any kid with gold in his pocket and the time
to hang around the Cellar can make a pickup in no
lime flat and buy some hot tea over the counter with
out a cop taking notice and with "Red" Weismann
running the show from a smoke filled room on the
second floor.
Not all the kids who hang around the? Cellar are
drifters, operators, Comies, Corn-men, wallet-dippers,
sharpies, and clip-artists, but don't make book on
anyone you see there. Give them a moments con
fidence and they're inside the dive, drinking the coffee,
and you're picking up the tab. (The coffee deals are
made inside the cellar with a guy named "Yuks"

Meyer getting a good 10 percent
of the take. In a little room right
next to the cellar you can pick
up the "right brand" of smokes
over the counter. And Estes De
fa uver knows it. More later on
the ties between Defauver, "Red"
Weismann, and some guy known
only as "Wally.")
HIE OPEN DOOR POLICY
If you're alive and know the
are of spades from the corpse

yard, it won't take you long to find out that all the
doors at I.S.II! are open. You walk in through the
front door. That's what we did. We picked up the
• urtain on this school. We wanted the facts. The
facts are lowdown, the inside of the story, bawdy,
hot, sexy, vulgar—well, that's what we were horn
for, to pick up the hot and sexy.
First there are the big halls where the "doses" are
given out. The guys that pick up their juice from the
first tray are the guys in the know. And it doesn't
; top at juice, either, the tea at the end isn't straight
T« nderlief. And bow does the juice get on the tray?
Everyone knows and nobedy says, but we are in a
position to tell you, confidential that it comes from
way up- the "hashers" are just paid stooges. The big
gun behind the works is Shirl Brewer, or someone
that looks very much like her—and don't think the
Union doesn't know it.
THE lIOT SPOTS
There's one spot that even the wise ones around
the Cellar don't talk about. It's a little room with
a black door on the left as you go down into the dive.
You can see the guys in the know go in, and we went
right in with them. The things we saw can't l>e de
f ciibed here, even in a book like this, but the things

that go on in there are known by the Biology De
partment.
And the girls that hang around the Cellar. Every
American will he shocked when we tell them that
fi(l% of (he girls that hang around the Cellar par
take in the hot stuff sold across the counter for only
5a shot. And it isn't good stuff, either.
ON THE MAKE
And they don't, stop there. Take this young chick
Armadine Giraff. Armadine is pretty loose and you
can strike up a confab with the doll for a quick
invested in the right stuff. And if sjte's booked up
solid, she can get you what you're looking for. For
a price she'll give you a list of numbers. We paid.
Just call DA 3-5171, DA 3-3151, DA 3-8703. Ask for
"R.A." and tell them "Sponsor" sent you. They can
get you what you want.
For really hot numbers, call a place that uses
the dodge, "Women's Rest Home." Ask for the fever
ward, they don't ask questions . . . the number is
DA 3-11417 and ask for Murphy. And all this takes
place iust 3.128 miles from the White House!
Hang around the Cellar for seven hours, look like
you want company, and the odds are eight to five
you'll be approached.
Here's the act. Blossom LeJones comes up and says,
"Hey Mac, who ya got for civ?"
You look around and say, "What d'ya take me for,
kid, I finished up that stuff before I got my first set
of long pants!"
Blossom picks you right up. She figures you for
either upper division and in the know, or a young
punk freshman who's loaded old man just came
through with his (i»st pair of longies.
If .you're interested in entertainment, some pri
vate "football" pics are run every Sunday night in
a little place on Serra St. For only 'HH you see them
they way you want to see them.
