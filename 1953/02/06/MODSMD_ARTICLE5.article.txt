# Indians to Host Bradley In Twin Bill Cage Tilt
## 
### ELMORE SEEDS 
Stanford's spirited Indians play host to the barnstorming Brad
ley Braves tomorrow at 8 p.m. in the Cow Palace to open one of
the top intersectional twin-bills of the year. Brigham Young trades
shots with Santa Clara in the second game.
Candidate for All-American Bob Carney leads the Bradley Brave

team that has won ten and lost
seven this year against the na
tion's best.
Their record includes lopsided
wins over lowa State (76-57), Texas
Christian (89-76), De Paul (two
time conqueror of LaSalle) (91-76),
and St. Mary's (96-59), a recent
victim of the Cards in a thriller,
while losing to Notre Dame (64-74),
UCLA (83-91), and Minnesota (63-
79).
Carney, playing guard, has av
eraged !8.9 points per game for
the season. He canned 30 in one
game against UCLA in Peoria, in
which he hit 16 free throws in 24
attempts! Dick Estergard, a for
ward, has helped the Braves with
a phenomenal rebounding effort.
Estergard also has the highest
shooting average on the team, 49
per cent while compiling a 12-point
average. The Braves are an expe
rienced ball club, having lost only
one squad member from last sea
son's team, and having their entire
first five return intact.

The Stanford - Bradley basket
ball painc will be telecast over
station KGO-TV, channel 7, at 8
p.m.
Station KSFO (560) will carry
the radio broadcast of the game
at the same time.

In other years Stanford has lost
three times to the Braves, but the
sum total of the margins was only
nine points, and the opposition in
cluded the greatest of the Bradley
post - war powerhouses. The cir
cumstances were similar to the
present, a heavily favored Brad
ley ball club against a mediocre
Card team, but the Cards almost
upset the apple-cart every time.
Stanford Coach Bob Burnett
described Bradley as "basically a
fast-breaking outfit and a very
good team." He added, "Carney
is one of the outstanding players
in the country and Estcrgard is a
tremendous rebounder. We hope
we can beat them and we think
we can, on the board."
Captain George Zaninovieh was
pronounced ready lor action by
trainer Connie Jarvis. He missed
last Wednesday's battle with the
alumni because of a sore elbow.

victim of the Cards in a thriller,
while losing to Notre Dame (64-74),
UCLA (83-91), and Minnesota (63-
79).
Carney, playing guard, has av
eraged !8.9 points per game for
the season. He canned 30 in one
game against UCLA in Peoria, in
which he hit 16 free throws in 24
attempts! Dick Estergard, a for
ward, has helped the Braves with
a phenomenal rebounding effort.
Estergard also has the highest
shooting average on the team, 49
per cent while compiling a 12-point
average. The Braves are an expe
rienced ball club, having lost only
one squad member from last sea
son's team, and having their entire
first five return intact.

The Stanford - Bradley basket
ball painc will be telecast over
station KGO-TV, channel 7, at 8
p.m.
Station KSFO (560) will carry
the radio broadcast of the game
at the same time.

In other years Stanford has lost
three times to the Braves, but the
sum total of the margins was only
nine points, and the opposition in
cluded the greatest of the Bradley
post - war powerhouses. The cir
cumstances were similar to the
present, a heavily favored Brad
ley ball club against a mediocre
Card team, but the Cards almost
upset the apple-cart every time.
Stanford Coach Bob Burnett
described Bradley as "basically a
fast-breaking outfit and a very
good team." He added, "Carney
is one of the outstanding players
in the country and Estcrgard is a
tremendous rebounder. We hope
we can beat them and we think
we can, on the board."
Captain George Zaninovieh was
pronounced ready lor action by
trainer Connie Jarvis. He missed
last Wednesday's battle with the
alumni because of a sore elbow.
