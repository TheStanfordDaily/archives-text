Bringing a touch of India to
Stanford classes with their dark
eyes and flowing saris are two
foreign students—Lucy Muthu,
graduate journalism student,
and Dr. Mary Chandy, Univer
sity of Delhi staff member here
on a Fulbright Fellowship to
study ichthyology.

"India is awakening to the impor
tance of fisheries in solving her se
rious food problem," Dr. Chandy
says. "Several universities are now
introducing courses in ichthyology.
The government is also operating
two large research centers.
While here, Dr. Chandy is at
tending seminars, browsing in the
library, and collecting a list of
useful literature for her students
in Delhi.
A graduate of the University of
Madras, Dr. Chandy served as sec
retary for the Intercollegiate Ath
letic Association, comprising seven
women's colleges in the area. While
teaching zoology at the Women's

Dr. Chandy and other Indian
students will discuss "India: A
Strategic Power in Asia" tonight
on the Stanford television show
at 7 on Channel 5.

Christian College of Madras and at
the Isabella Thoburn College in
Lucknow. Dr. Chandy bccame ac
quainted with American customs.
"We even played gym in black
bloomers," she said.
Miss Muthu, a graduate of So
phia College in Bombay, took
graduate work at Lady Irwin
College in New Delhi, foremost
domestic science school in India.
After completing work for her
Master's degree at Stanford, she
plans a return to India where she
will work for a women's weekly
newspaper.
Miss Muthu is amazed at "the
largeness of things in America —the
vastness of it from New York to the
West."
"People in America are so very
friendly, full of life, natural," she
says. "In India people are more
reserved. But here, we keep look
ing at the clock and the calendar.
Life seems to be one big dash."

And the sari? Will it revolution
ize Stanford dress? "Definitely not,"
both agree. "The American girl is
too fond of freedom in movement.
The sari would be difficult for her

to handle in walking—and hard to
keep dry when it rains. Almost all
women in India wear the sari, al
though students often dress in
Western clothes."

ichthyology to Miss Lucy Muthu, graduate journalism student,

and Dr. Chandy are the only women from India taking courses
