### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 5. (UP) —
The Eisenhower Administration was
said today to be giving close study
to a seven-point Korean peace plan
proposed by Sen. William F. Knowl
and (R-Calif.)
Two of Knowland's suggestions
made today already have been put
into effect—more training of South
Koreans and the Formosa decision.
Knowland also calls for a block
ade of Red China which is under
stood to be receiving serious con
sideration.
In addition to a naval blockade,
Knowland's Korean peace plan calls
for:
1. Accepting Chiang Kai-shek's of
fer to send 35,000 Nationalist troops
from Formosa to Korea.
2. Confronting all members of
the United Nations with a demand
that they make an "equitable con
tribution" to the forces fighting in
Korea.
3. Requesting all U.N. members
who have recognized Red China to
withdraw recognition.
i. Demanding that Russia stop
furnishing "moral and material
support" to the Communists in
Korea. If the demand is ignored,
all U.N. members would withdraw
recognition of Russia.
On the same issue, House Speaker
Joseph W. Martin, Jr., predicted to
night that President Eisenhower's
plan and "ideas" for waging the
Korean war will bring a "solution"
to the stalemated far Eastern con
flict.
In a program transcribed here
for a Rochester. N.Y., television
station, Martin predicted that "good
results will he achieved" from Mr.
Eisenhower's post-election visit to
Korea. He said the President came
back "with ideas that I think will
bring about a solution of this stale
mate war."
Martin added that he thought Mr.
Eisenhower's consultation with Gen
eral Mac Arthur will work for peace
in Korea.
