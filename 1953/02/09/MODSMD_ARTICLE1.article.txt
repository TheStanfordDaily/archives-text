# UPSET WIN
## Tomsic 'Hot' As Palace Marks Fall 
### ELMORE SEEDS 
Sparked by Ron Tomsic's rec
ord - breaking 39-point perform
ance, Bob Burnett's Stanford In
dians upset the Bradley Braves
with surprising ease, 87-73, Sat
urday night.
Tomsic's feat erased the previous
Cow Palace record of 38 points by
San Francisco center Joe McNamee
set in 1949. Ron's final deuce which
broke the old mark came just five
seconds before the final gun on a
15-foot jump shot. Only seconds be
fore it looked like fame might elude
the well-built 5-ft., 11-in. sopho
more, as Bradley controlled the ball
for shot after shot with time run
ning out, but Brave big gun Bob
Carney finally laid one in to set the
stage for Don Carlson's long pass
to Tomsic and a new record. Two
other Cow Palace records were set.
Stanford's 37 field goals was a new
high, as were Bradley's 29 free
throws.
The game was never in doubt
after six straight points by Tom
sic plus baskets by Russ Lawlcr
and George Zaninovich boosted a
half-time lead of 40-33 to 50-36
early in the third period. Bradley,
handicapped by four fouls on their
star Carney through most of the
second half, never drew within
less than ten points the remainder
of the ball game and the Cards'
lead at one time was 18 points
early in the fourth quarter.
Carney, although completely
overshadowed by Tomsic's efforts,
showed why the Brave publicity de
partment spends so much time and
money boosting him for All-Ameri
ca n honors, as he poured home 29
points mostly on close-in hooks and
driving lay-ins. He was the only
reason the Braves stayed as close
as they did, and without him they
couldn't seem to click.
Outstanding work for the Cards
on the defensive boards by Lawlcr,
Zaninovich, and Carlson, plus Tom
sic's phenomenal 16 for 29 from the
floor (54 per cent) and seven for
seven from the foul line, spelled the
difference and Carney or no Carney,
Bradley had to hang on tight in the
second half to keep the from
turning into a rout.
Bradley jumped into a quick
1-0 lead in (he first minute of play

on lay-ins l»y Carney ami Dick
Estergard, luit the Indians came
back to maintain a slim edge
through most of the first quarter
until the Braves tied it up seconds
before the end. Tomsic collected
ten markers during this interval,
'flu n Carlson and Zaninovich both
hit fast break lay-ins to give the
Indians a lead they never relin
quished.
The third-quarter score was 67-
53 (Tomsic accounting for 32), and
during the final stanza the crowd
was on its feet, not because of any
interest in the already decided out
come of the game, but to cheer
Tomsic to a new mark.
With eight minutes to go, how
ever, Tomsic left the game for a rest
and didn't return until four min
utes remaining, still seven points
short of the record. Up until this
time he had hit the hoop from all
angles wth jump-shots, hooks, set
shots, and driving lay-ins, but for
two agonizing minutes Ron couldn't
buy a shot as he missed several easy
chances. Then in the last two min
utes he hit two driving lay-ins, a
free throw, and the aforementioned
jump-shot.
This was the Cards' third
straight win and by far their best
performance to date except for the
upset win over California. It may
he just the spark they need to
knock over a few king-pins in the
lust half of the Conference race,
and no one who saw this game
could count them out against any
future opponent.

NEGATIVE RESULT—As Oleg Suzdaleff was driving goalward
late in the third quarter, he stepped on John Kent's foot, but
look who's suffering the pain. But if Oieg didn't inflict pain
physically he got even with his ball-hawking and play-making.

ord - breaking 39-point perform
ance, Bob Burnett's Stanford In
dians upset the Bradley Braves
with surprising ease, 87-73, Sat
urday night.
Tomsic's feat erased the previous
Cow Palace record of 38 points by
San Francisco center Joe McNamee
set in 1949. Ron's final deuce which
broke the old mark came just five
seconds before the final gun on a
15-foot jump shot. Only seconds be
fore it looked like fame might elude
the well-built 5-ft., 11-in. sopho
more, as Bradley controlled the ball
for shot after shot with time run
ning out, but Brave big gun Bob
Carney finally laid one in to set the
stage for Don Carlson's long pass
to Tomsic and a new record. Two
other Cow Palace records were set.
Stanford's 37 field goals was a new
high, as were Bradley's 29 free
throws.
The game was never in doubt
after six straight points by Tom
sic plus baskets by Russ Lawlcr
and George Zaninovich boosted a
half-time lead of 40-33 to 50-36
early in the third period. Bradley,
handicapped by four fouls on their
star Carney through most of the
second half, never drew within
less than ten points the remainder
of the ball game and the Cards'
lead at one time was 18 points
early in the fourth quarter.
Carney, although completely
overshadowed by Tomsic's efforts,
showed why the Brave publicity de
partment spends so much time and
money boosting him for All-Ameri
ca n honors, as he poured home 29
points mostly on close-in hooks and
driving lay-ins. He was the only
reason the Braves stayed as close
as they did, and without him they
couldn't seem to click.
Outstanding work for the Cards
on the defensive boards by Lawlcr,
Zaninovich, and Carlson, plus Tom
sic's phenomenal 16 for 29 from the
floor (54 per cent) and seven for
seven from the foul line, spelled the
difference and Carney or no Carney,
Bradley had to hang on tight in the
second half to keep the from
turning into a rout.

1-0 lead in (he first minute of play

until the Braves tied it up seconds

ten markers during this interval,
'flu n Carlson and Zaninovich both
hit fast break lay-ins to give the
Indians a lead they never relin

The third-quarter score was 67-
53 (Tomsic accounting for 32), and
during the final stanza the crowd
was on its feet, not because of any
interest in the already decided out
come of the game, but to cheer
Tomsic to a new mark.
With eight minutes to go, how
ever, Tomsic left the game for a rest
and didn't return until four min
utes remaining, still seven points
short of the record. Up until this
time he had hit the hoop from all
angles wth jump-shots, hooks, set
shots, and driving lay-ins, but for
two agonizing minutes Ron couldn't
buy a shot as he missed several easy
chances. Then in the last two min
utes he hit two driving lay-ins, a
free throw, and the aforementioned
jump-shot.
This was the Cards' third
straight win and by far their best
performance to date except for the
upset win over California. It may
he just the spark they need to
knock over a few king-pins in the
lust half of the Conference race,
and no one who saw this game

With eight minutes to go, how
ever, Tomsic left the game for a rest
and didn't return until four min
utes remaining, still seven points
short of the record. Up until this
time he had hit the hoop from all
angles wth jump-shots, hooks, set
shots, and driving lay-ins, but for
two agonizing minutes Ron couldn't
buy a shot as he missed several easy
chances. Then in the last two min
utes he hit two driving lay-ins, a
free throw, and the aforementioned
jump-shot.
This was the Cards' third
straight win and by far their best
performance to date except for the
upset win over California. It may
he just the spark they need to
knock over a few king-pins in the
lust half of the Conference race,
and no one who saw this game
could count them out against any
future opponent.

NEGATIVE RESULT—As Oleg Suzdaleff was driving goalward
late in the third quarter, he stepped on John Kent's foot, but
look who's suffering the pain. But if Oieg didn't inflict pain
physically he got even with his ball-hawking and play-making.
The player behind "Sudzy" is Bradley's Dick Peterson.

ord - breaking 39-point perform
ance, Bob Burnett's Stanford In
dians upset the Bradley Braves
with surprising ease, 87-73, Sat
urday night.
Tomsic's feat erased the previous
Cow Palace record of 38 points by
San Francisco center Joe McNamee
set in 1949. Ron's final deuce which
broke the old mark came just five
seconds before the final gun on a
15-foot jump shot. Only seconds be
fore it looked like fame might elude
the well-built 5-ft., 11-in. sopho
more, as Bradley controlled the ball
for shot after shot with time run
ning out, but Brave big gun Bob
Carney finally laid one in to set the
stage for Don Carlson's long pass
to Tomsic and a new record. Two
other Cow Palace records were set.
Stanford's 37 field goals was a new
high, as were Bradley's 29 free
throws.
The game was never in doubt
after six straight points by Tom
sic plus baskets by Russ Lawlcr
and George Zaninovich boosted a
half-time lead of 40-33 to 50-36
early in the third period. Bradley,
handicapped by four fouls on their
star Carney through most of the
second half, never drew within
less than ten points the remainder
of the ball game and the Cards'
lead at one time was 18 points
early in the fourth quarter.
Carney, although completely
overshadowed by Tomsic's efforts,
showed why the Brave publicity de
partment spends so much time and
money boosting him for All-Ameri
ca n honors, as he poured home 29
points mostly on close-in hooks and
driving lay-ins. He was the only
reason the Braves stayed as close
as they did, and without him they
couldn't seem to click.
Outstanding work for the Cards
on the defensive boards by Lawlcr,
Zaninovich, and Carlson, plus Tom
sic's phenomenal 16 for 29 from the
floor (54 per cent) and seven for
seven from the foul line, spelled the
difference and Carney or no Carney,
Bradley had to hang on tight in the
second half to keep the from
turning into a rout.
