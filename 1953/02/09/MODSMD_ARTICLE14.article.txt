# Berliners To Tell of WUS 'Self-Help' Program
## 
### WIN GRIFFITH 
Four students from the Free University of Berlin will tell Stan
ford. students this week about the World University Service and
how it helped them.
They will be speaking on behalf of the Winter Quarter Charity
Drive, to be held from Monday to Friday next week, and they will

stress the importance of that part
of the drive which will raise funds
for World University Service.
The four, Rudolf Geissler, Inge
Krauss, Rotrant Rosenfeld, and Kurt
Heilmann, will speak to as many stu
dents as possible through the living
residences and clubs. They, and other
students who wish to inform Stan
ford of the purposes of the drive,
will talk to students at meetings,
dinners, and socials.
They will speak not in slogans
and flowery phrases hut in terms
of the direct benefits they have de
rived from the work of (lie World
University Service.
They will describe the difficulties
with which their own Free Uni
versity of Berlin was founded in
1945, a year when the Berlin block
ade had all but crippled the econ
omy and morale of that city. Thc.v
will explain how WUS "helped
them to help themselves" and how
that organization extended aid
which included:
1. Money to construct the IJniver
stiy's buildings and supply it with
! the necessary equipment and facili-
I ties.
2. Books to start a library, a library
| which grew with additional contri
j butions by Stanford students and the
| increasing enthusiasm of Berlin stu
j dents.
3. Clothes for refugees who came
to the Free University of Berlin
from other countries, especially
those from the Soviet zone of Ger
many.
I They will say, as German student

Geissler says, that a student cannot
leran "until he has a book in his
hand, clothes on his hack, and food
in his stomach."
And they will emphasize the idea
that World University Service aid
offers "not >ust gifts to accept, but !
gifts for self-help, gifts which pro
vide a foundation for students to
expand th"ii educational facilities
through their own efforts and en
ergy."
As proof of this attitude of "self
help" (and one reason why this year's
WUS collection from .Stanford is ear
marked for Asia) the speakers will
tell about how in 1951 an association
of German university student bodies
voted to reject further aid from
WUS. The German students felt that
they had been given the necessary
"start" and that the need for help was
greater in universities in Asia than
in Germany.
Ami in an attempt to quell any |
possible fear that such programs are ,
"one sided," the four Free University j
of Berlin students will explain that j
the V/US program is a reciprocal ar- j
rangement and that they, as recip
ients of World University aid, want i
to demonstrate their appreciation by i
offering "gifts" to American students, j
"We can't give money," Geissler
will say, "But we can give friend
ship, using such means as correspon
dence programs, exchange student
arrangements, and grants of scholar
ships to American students for the
Free University of Berlin."


WORLD UNIVERSITY SERVICE (formerly WSSF)—One of the
two organizations which will receive funds from next week's
Winter Quarter Charity Drive emphasizes in its posters the
"leaders of tomorrow" as the recipients of WUS aid. The drive
will begin next Monday and will run until Feb. 20.


RED CROSS—HaIf of the donations to this year's Winter Quar
ter Charity Drive will be turned over to the Red Cross for use
in its work both in the United States and in Korea. The Winter
Quarter Drive Committee plans to contact every Stanford stu
dent in next week's solicitations.
