# Action on Amendment Postponed by Cardinals
## ASSU Seeks Workable Plan To Choose Head Yell Leader 
### SUE WHEAT Daily Associate Editor 
Cardinals, in an emergency session with Head Yell Leader
Zeke Wallace Saturday morning, decided to delay action on their
proposed constitutional amendment until a more acceptable pro
posal can be drawn up.
At the request of Cardinals, ASSU President Dick Weismann

is expected to poll the members of
Excom by phone on disaffirming their
approval of the proposal made at last
Wednesday's regular Excom meeting.
This means that the referendum
vote on the proposal, originally
scheduled for Thursday, will prob
ably not be held.
The controversial issue was
touched off Jan. 28 when John Hou
ser of Cardinals introduced to Excom
a proposal proyiding for a change
in the system of electing yell lead
ers.
The new plan provided that the
Head Yell Leader should be elected
from the four assistant yell leaders
after the student body had seen them
in action for a year. Under the pres
ent plan the Head Yell Leader is
elected from eight unexperienced
candidates chosen by a nominating
committee.
Houser's plan also included a by
law change providing that assistant
yell leaders should be elected by the
student body at large rather than ap
pointed by the Head Yell Leader as
under the present system.
The plan met opposition at last
Wednesday's Excom meeting when
Head Yell Leader Zekc Wallace
announced he was "willing to cam
paign against it."
He mainly opposed the by-law
change, arguing that the Head Yell
Leader should be able to choose his
own assistants since "he's the one
who has to live with them."
Saturday's meeting was an attempt
of Cardinals and Wallace's to work
out a third proposal acceptable to
both. They both agree that a change
in the present system is needed, but
have not yet agreed on what it
should be.
At Cardinals' regular meeting
tomorrow night, they will again
try to draw up a workable plan.
If a plan should come out of fh<>
meeting it will probably be sub
mitted to Excom either Wednesday
or on February 18.
A tentative proposal now being
considered by Cardinals and pro
vides that the Head Yell Leader
be elected in winter quarter and
then given a seat on the nominating
committee which choses the can
didates for assistant yell leaders
who would be elected in spring
quarter.
This compromise plan would give
the Head Yell Leader a nominal
voice in the naming of the assistants.
