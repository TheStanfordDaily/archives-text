# Bargain Day at the Health Service
## 
### 
Free! $12 worth of shots that are almost pain
less. It's not ducks in a shooting gallery, but
the tetanus and typhoid shots currently being
offered at the Health Service.
The Health Service began the current year's
series two weeks ago, and to date there has
been comparatively little response. We can't
understand why.
This series, consisting of two anti-tetanus
shots given four weeks apart and three anti
typhoid shots mixed in, has been offered by
the Health Service for the past two years as a
protection to students.
Dr. George Houck, Director of the Service,
says that the tetanus germ is very prevalent
around Stanford, and that practically any cut
received from metal may bring on the dreaded
"lockjaw."
For students who are planning trips abroad,

the series will fulfill the passport reguirements.
The service seems to offer a particular oppor
tunity to women, since they don't receive the
shots through any ROTC program.
Under the same service, students who have
already had the series can get "booster" shots.
A typhoid booster is needed every three years,
but once a person has taken a tetanus series
and then received a booster he is protected for
life.
According to Dr. Houck, there is no pain in
volved other than the tetanus shot, which is
supposed to hurt like hell for a few seconds.
Since today and Wednesday are the last
days the series may be begun if it is to be com
pleted this guarter, it should be marked on the
schedule of anyone who's interested as a
"must do."
Why not take advantage of this bargain?
