Among the many hallowed Stanford tradi
tions seems to be the one about the professor
who announces to his class of 50 that "such
and such a book, which is required reading be
fore the first midterm, is on reserve for students
of this class at the Reserved Book Room."
The cagy student then runs over to the RBR,
finds that there is only one copy of the book
for the whole class, and gloms onto it before
anyone else gets a shot at it.
One by one the rest of the class falls into the

line until the last half finds the book (it has, on
the average, 350 pages) won't be available
until the night before the scheduled midterm.
Seems to us this is one tradition that-has got
to go.
How about it, profs and library staff, could
you get together a little better on your sched
ules so the limited funds can be spent securing
a reasonable number of copies to go around?
Possibly, Conrad Cox, this is a job for your
Student Library Committee.
