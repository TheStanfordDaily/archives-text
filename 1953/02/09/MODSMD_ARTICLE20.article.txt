"CORRUPTION IN II I (J II
PLACES" is the rumor at Penn State,
a:; officials began last week to in
vestigate the recent "final exam scan
dal." The Daily Collegian reported
that at least 20 finals were sold to
students at prices ranging from $3
to $20. O'ne student was reported to
have paid $250 for the exclusive re
sale right to one exam.
Student rumor says that College
faculty, staff, employees, and gradu
ate students may have been respon
sible lor the leaks. Another theory
says that the students copied faulty
exam copies found in professors'
wastebaskets.
