### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 8 (UP) â€”
Senate Republican Leader Robert
A. Taft said today it is "open to
queston" whether the United
States should blockade Communist
China in defiance of Great Britain
or other members of the United
Nations.
Taft emphasized that he considers
a blockade "desirable" if "it can be
worked out," but he said the prob
lem should be "approached with
great care." He also said there are
a number of other steps that could
be taken in Korea, including bomb
ing of Red bases in Manchuria.
He pointed out that it involves
stopping the ships of friendly na
tions. He said, however, that Red
China received 75 per cent of its
war supplies over the sea lanes, a
"great many" of them carrcd in
British vessels.
