Club gymnasts overcame a young,
determined Stanford team to post a
33-20 win last Friday night in the
Encina Gym.
However, due to the lack of
Olympic Club tumbling and tram
poline competitors, Stanford con
sented not to consider (he forfeits
in the final scoring. Had they done
so they would have emerged victors
â€”38-33.
John Gardner, Olympic Club's
AAU champ, gave the most out
standing performance of the evening
winning in his specialties, the paral
lel and high bars.
Jerry Nesselrod captured both the
(ill and flying rings for the outstand
ing Stanford performance of the
evening. Dick Martland took second
place for the Indians.
In the 20-foot rope-climb, Chuck
Scott hit the cieling in 4.!> and Jim
Stevens placed a near second with
a 5.0 effort.
W th the Olympic Club out of the
tumbling and parallel bar events, the
Indian gymnasts held the event be
tween themselves, with Bob Pressley,

Gilmore and John Stephens second
