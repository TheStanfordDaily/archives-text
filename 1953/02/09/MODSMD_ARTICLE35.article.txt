# 1952 Rose Bowl Fund Builds New Stands
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
Moat fans would like to forget
about the 11i52 Rose Bowl game. De
spite the tragic outcome of that con
ic .t, however, some good came from
ii for Stanford students t as the new
baseball stands demonstrate.
When the season opens for Ev
erett Dean's ba* eballers a week
from Saturday, fans wilt get their
first look at the recently complet
ed $30,000 project. They will also
notice that there are no stands on
the third-ba e side.
According to Athletic Director A 1
Masters, quite a sum of money is
bein« saved by tiie Athletic Depart
ment in this move, and it will prob
ably not hurt Indian fans at all, for
the old stands, which seated 4,000,
had not been filled to capacity for
over 1.1 years.
Masters said that Stanford made
approximately $55,0U0 from the Rose
Bowl contest. A reserve fund of
$65,000 has been set lor future ath
letic reconstruction. Chances are
that this will not be used for a new
much - needed basketball pavilion,
however. About 14 times that
amount is needed, Masters stated.
The new stands seat 3,225 cus
tomers. The old stands, huilt in
11)29-30, cost only slightly less

than the new ones, despite the rise
in building costs.
Masters also related some inter
esting facts about the Sunken Dia
njond itself. The reason it is sunken
is that in the 1920'5, when the loot
bull stadium was horseshoe shaped,
dirt was taken from that area to
build the east end zone stand (sec
tions XX, Y, YY, and Z). At that
time the baseball lielci was located
where the frorh play today, with
about 20 rows of temporary stand.;
behind them.
The extra money left from the
howl game will probably be used
to repaint the football stadium.
Tests are presently being made bv
a chemical company to see if a
completely new paint job is need
ed.
And as for building a new pa
vilion, Masters estimates it will
take about two million dollars to
do a really good job. He points
out as a fine example of a new
court the one at Oregon State,
which seats 18,000. It was built
in 1947 at a cost of $1,800,000. So
fans presently enrolled at Stan
ford can forget about seeing a new
basketball enclosure during their
generation.


$30,000 CONSTRUCTION—CompIeted two weeks ago were the
new Sunken Diamond stands, with a 3,225 capacity. Previously
the stands held 4,000 spectators, but architects cut out the third
base bleachers, "fhe stand construction was financed by a spe
cial fund from the '52 Rose Bowl.

new Sunken Diamond stands, with a 3,225 capacity. Previously
the stands held 4,000 spectators, but architects cut out the third
base bleachers, "fhe stand construction was financed by a spe
cial fund from the '52 Rose Bowl.
Moat fans would like to forget
about the 11i52 Rose Bowl game. De
spite the tragic outcome of that con
ic .t, however, some good came from
ii for Stanford students t as the new
baseball stands demonstrate.
When the season opens for Ev
erett Dean's ba* eballers a week
from Saturday, fans wilt get their
first look at the recently complet
ed $30,000 project. They will also
notice that there are no stands on
the third-ba e side.
According to Athletic Director A 1
Masters, quite a sum of money is
bein« saved by tiie Athletic Depart
ment in this move, and it will prob
ably not hurt Indian fans at all, for
the old stands, which seated 4,000,
had not been filled to capacity for
over 1.1 years.
Masters said that Stanford made
approximately $55,0U0 from the Rose
Bowl contest. A reserve fund of
$65,000 has been set lor future ath
letic reconstruction. Chances are
that this will not be used for a new
much - needed basketball pavilion,
however. About 14 times that
amount is needed, Masters stated.
The new stands seat 3,225 cus
tomers. The old stands, huilt in
11)29-30, cost only slightly less

than the new ones, despite the rise
in building costs.
Masters also related some inter
esting facts about the Sunken Dia
njond itself. The reason it is sunken
is that in the 1920'5, when the loot
bull stadium was horseshoe shaped,
dirt was taken from that area to
build the east end zone stand (sec
tions XX, Y, YY, and Z). At that
time the baseball lielci was located
where the frorh play today, with
about 20 rows of temporary stand.;
behind them.
The extra money left from the
howl game will probably be used
to repaint the football stadium.
Tests are presently being made bv
a chemical company to see if a
completely new paint job is need
ed.
And as for building a new pa
vilion, Masters estimates it will
take about two million dollars to
do a really good job. He points
out as a fine example of a new
court the one at Oregon State,
which seats 18,000. It was built
in 1947 at a cost of $1,800,000. So
fans presently enrolled at Stan
ford can forget about seeing a new
basketball enclosure during their
generation.
