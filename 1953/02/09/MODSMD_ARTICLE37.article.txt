## 
### 
"It's good to get by that number."
That was Coach Dick Clegg's com
ment on the 87-45 victory his Stan
ford frosh gained Saturday after
noon against Jefferson High School :
of Daily City in the Fnviiion. The 1
win stretched the Papooses unde
feated record to 13 straight.
The Frosh never trailed in their
conquest of the leading quintet in
the top team in the Northern Division
of the PAL. Dominating the back- i
boards from the start, the Papooses j
drew out to a 17-8 lead at the quar- j
ter. I
Although Clogg substituted freely
in the second quarter, the margin
had ballooned to 39-23 by halftime.
The Frosh poured 48 points
through the nets in the last two !
periods, against the tired but still
hustling Jefferson club.
Forwards Gunnar Christiansen and
Jerry Gustafson took high scoring j
honors for the Papooses with 12 j
markers apiece, while guard George j
Selleck had 11.
Second string forward Bob Evans
also hit double figures by notching i
10 points and grabbing rebounds from
taller opponents.
