# Survey Teams To Continue Union Poll
## 
### 
Speaking teams will visit campus
living groups again tonight to con
tinue their survey of student opin
ion on the proposed Tresidder Un
ion.
Last week's talks and question
naire distribution wore termed
"very satisfactory" by Joanne Hix
son, secretary to the Union Plan
ning Committee. Interest in the
suggested facilities and the general
plan for the memorial showed up in
both dorms and smail living groups,
she said.
Student concern seemed to be cen
tered in the degree of utility that
the different suggested facilities
would perform. One student wrote
on his questionnaire: "It is hard for
students now to become acquainted.
Stanford has long needed a social
center and I feel that the proposed
Union is the, way to do it."
Other developments were hap
pening this week as the informa
tion campaign continued. Addition
al fund sources were being investi
gated by the University's General
Secretary's office and alumni who
had shown an interest in the proj
ect in the past.
Chairman Jack Fraser announced
the appointment of Bob Mishell to
handle arrangements for the public
hearings on the Union to be held
March 3 to 7. Invitations will be
made to campus organizations and
individuals who have expressed in
terest in some phase of the plans.
General student body response will
also be invited.
