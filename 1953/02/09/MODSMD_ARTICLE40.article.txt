# Scholarship Fund, Begun by Friends, Will Commemorate Suzanne Vinetz

### SUE WHEAT Daily Associate Editor 
The dream of a lifetime - attending Stanford—came true for
19-year-old Susie Vinetz when, as a sophomore, she entered here
in the fall of 1950.
Her qualifications were obvious and a list of her high-school
qualifications told the same familiar story of an active, popular

girl. (Lead in the Christmas play,
member of Student Congress, class
vice-president, GAA sport manager,
a cappella choir, Girl's League Presi
dent, Ephebian Honor Society, cheer
leader.)
Susie spent her freshman year at
UCLA and then came to Stanford.
Here, she displayed the same fresh
enthusiasm which had marked her
high school days.
An ed major, maintaining above
average grades. Susie still found time
for living group activities, dating,
skiing, dancing, and a part in the
'51 Spring Show.

Susie aerially realized only half
of her dream when she entered
Stanford. The second half—gradu
ation—will never be realized. For
Susie died last May of uremia,
caused by a congenital condition
which the efforts of the best doc
tors could not correct.
Even Susie's closest friends were
shocked to learn why she failed ot
return to school after dropping out
before finals last spring quarter.
That death could have been so close
to one so full of life, was incon
ceivable.
Although Susie knew she was
sick, she did not know, until her
last days, that she was dying. Her
parents knew, however, and so did
Stanford's administration.
Ordinarily, the story would end
here. But Susie Vinetz had made the
kind of friends that would not let
the story end here. They wanted to
remember this lovable, generous
girl and to help others remember
her.
Diane Goldstone, a Stanford
senior, and four other friends of
Susie's who knew her at UCLA,
thought that a scholarship fund
enabling some other deserving per
son like Susie to attend Stanford,
would be a fitting memorial.
Here are the girls' own words,
taken from a letter which they wrote
to other friends of Susie's:
"We were among her closest
friends at UCLA and Stanford. We
knew her well—yet did not know
while she lived that the days of her
life were so dearly numbered or
that her wonderful smile concealed
her inner struggle.

'"Now we see some of the things
J she did not let us see and together
! we are determined to help create
a significant memorial in her honor.
"Because she so loved Stanford,
we have asked for and received
permission from Dr. and Mrs.
Vinetz to establish the Suzanne
Vinetz Memorial Scholarship Fund
at Stanford. It is our desire to
perpetuate Iter name and some
thing of her spirit with that of the
University she loved so dearly."
The rest of the story tells itself.
; Since the founding of the fund in
November with the Vinetz' initial
gift, contributions from scores of
Susie's friends have been received.
The fund now totals about $1,700 and
gifts are being received by the
Scholarship Office every week.
The choosing of the students who
will receive financial aid from the
Vinetz Memorial Fund has been left
| by the Vinetz', in the hands of Stan
] ford's Scholarship Committee.
Dr. Vinetz' only suggestion was
this: that the committee choose
"needy young women of character,
poise, determination, and interest in
their fellow students."
In short, a second Susie.
