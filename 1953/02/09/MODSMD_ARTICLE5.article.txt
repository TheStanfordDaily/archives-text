# 79-34
## Frosh Take Class of '55 In Jamboree 
### PAT KING 
Sophomore Jake Jacobs can
eat pie in record time, but his
performance couldn't stop the
Class of '56. The freshmen
trounced their lower division
rivals 79 to 34 in the annual
Frosh-Soph Jamboree held Fri
day and Saturday.
The frosh got off to an early lead
by tallying 21 points at the "Hat
Dance" Friday night. They won the
40-minute mural painting contest,
which was based on the theme "1:29
at Roble." Class talent won them the
entertainment contest, and a lone
point came from winning third place
in the beard-growing contest.
Eddie Ardzrooni and Eric Elscs
ser gave the sophs five points by
placing first and second in the
beard growing contest. Encina bar
bers promised the bushy duo free
shaves.
The only other sophomore victories
came in the swim meet and baby
feeding contests. They also won two
points in the sack race.
The frosh literally ran away with
the Jamboree Saturday afternoon as
they outdistanced their opposition in
the sack race, three-legged soccer
game, and hole-digging contest.
They also dumped the sophs 12-0 in
the inter-mural football game.
The Class of '5(5 climaxed a vic
torious day by winning a muddy
victory in the tug-of war. They
outnumbered and outpulled their
luckless rivals, but everyone, win
ner and loser alike, ended up in
the mud.
A highlight of the afternoon was
the volleyball game between the
freshmen women and their Western
Civ instructors. The ivy on Roble is
drooping, and all is quiet at Branner.
The civ instructors won.
The actual awarding of the perpet
ual trophy to the freshman class will
be made later in the week.
