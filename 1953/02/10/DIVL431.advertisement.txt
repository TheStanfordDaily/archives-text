Horse Power Days
Popular Vehicles of the Nineteenth
Century
Made and Described by
Ivan L. Collins
The most original and frankly sentimental valentine
gift for your parents or grandparents—a book about
the "horse power days" of their youth. You've heard
them talk about the buggies and victorias, the hayrides
and sleighrides they enjoyed so much. Now you can
give them a book that will re-create those memories—
a book full of photos of these vehicles, with brief de
scriptions of their period and uses.
But there's more to the book than this. The last
section in the book reveals Ivan Collins' secret—that
the carriages and covered wagons in the book are ac
tually "miniatures"—miracles of craftsmanship that
have been seventeen years in the making. Each vehicle
in one-eighth of actual size, yet photographed so skill
fully that it seems full-size. A series of photographs
shows Collins at work constructing a small express
wagon with dental tools and a jeweller's lathe.
For valentines, anniversaries, birthdays, HORSE
POWER DAYS is your best gift for the older genera
tion. Drop in at the Bookstore or the Press and look
it over.
