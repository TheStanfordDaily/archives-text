### 
Seventy-five days in Europe and
Africa next summer travelling
through 12 countries by round-trip
air transportation, and led by Stan
ford History Professor Wayne Vuci
nich—The Grand Stanford Tour.
The Institute of International Re
lations announced yesterday that ap
plications are now available at the
lIR Shack for this overseas tour—
the first ever operated under the
authorization of the ASSU and the
Stanford Board of Trustees.
Bill Wassman, director of the HR's
Stanford Overseas Information Serv
ice, said yesterday that the tour will
be operated through the administra
tive facilities of the Eur-Cal Tours
sanctioned by the ASUC at Berkeley.
The Stanford tour, approved by
both the ASSU Excom and the Uni
versity Trustees, will cost $1,185 from
New York for the 78 day trip and
$1,436 from San Francisco. Actually,
75 of the days will be spent over
seas.
Transportation over and back will
be aboard chartered four-engine air
liners. Among the countries to be
visited are England, France, Austria,
Spanish Morocco, Yugoslavia, Spain,
and Switzerland.
Professor Vucinich, whose spe
cialty is the Near East, grew up in
Yugoslavia, which is on the itinerary.
As tour leader, Wassman felt that
Vucinich would be able to present
an interesting analysis during the
tour.
Students interested in information
about the tour may drop by the lIR
Shack between 2 and 5 p.m. Monday
through Thursday.
