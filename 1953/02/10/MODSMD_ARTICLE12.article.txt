"If the new Union that is being
planned contained hotel facilities
and a good restaurant," asserts
visiting Harvard philosopher
Ralph Barton Perry, "the build
ing would pay for itself in a few
years."
In contributing this suggestion for
the new Union. Professor Perry ex
plained that such a set-up would be
a great comfort to alumni and other
visitors to the campus, as well as
providing a good source of income to
pay for the proposed buildings.
"The University of Michigan has
a union like the one I described, and
it has been very successful," adds
the professor. "People would not

mind paying regular hotel and res
taurant rates for good accommoda
tions."
During his three week stay here,
Professor Perry is staying in the
guest loom of Stern Hall's freshman
wing. Commenting on the loctaion of
his room, he laughs, "The planners
certainly placed the guest room in a
central location -at. thr end of a
corridor which is perfectly suited for
a track meet and right around the
corner from the piano!"
Despite the piano. Perry has man
aged to carry out a heavy schedule
since he arrived. In addition to the
preparation and delivery of his talks,
he lias had many consultations with
students and faculty members and a
"great deal of social life."
Last Friday, however, Perry did
find time to visit Hoover Library, see
Herbert Hoover's study, and admire
the view of the campus from the ob
servation tower. "In spite of the
mist in the distance," he says,"the

sun was shining, and 1 whs quite ini
pressed with the scene."
Besides giving his scheduled talks.
Perry has spoken to some classes
since his arrival here. Last week he
discussed Emerson with Professor
Alfred Grommon's American litera
ture class. This week he will speak
to one of Professor Alexander Mil
ler's theology classes on "Puritan
ism."
Luncheons and dinners comprise
much of his time. At one of the
dinners," comments Professor Perry,
"the question was brought up as to
why the boys on campus dress so
casually, whereas the girls arc so
meticulously clotjicd. We decided
that probably because the boys spend
all their money on dates, the girls
can afford to spend all theirs on
clothing."
The visitor expressed his approval

of lh" co educational :;ystem here,
calling it. a more normal relation
ship."
' Harvard is even becoming some
what co-educational now ' he adds,
"for. although the nirls are enrolled
in Radelifl'e, a separate college, they
