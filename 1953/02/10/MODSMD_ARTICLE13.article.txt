"AWS is a rapidly growing organi- !
zation and there are many phases of i
its program yet to be developed to
their fullest extent. My aim is to
guide the organization in its develop
ment. during the coming year. I
served on both AWS Board and
Cabinet last year as Branner presi
dent, and have had further experi
ence in women's student government
as a member of YWCA cabinet and
WAA Board, and a Branner spon
sor."

"No platform, no promises. Per
formance speaks louder than words,
and I would like to furnish the plans
I have helped to formulate this
year."

' AWS is our organization, and it
offers us a great challenge, in its
very .shot !, history on our campus it
has experienced tremendous growth
in its scope of activity. Yet, there is
still much that we can do to make
it an important part of each of our
lives, and I would be very proud and
happy to work with you toward that
coal."

Lysbeth Warren
"AWS, being a relatively new or
ganization, needs an aggressive
leadei to represent YOU and to help
our student government grow. Every
woman on campus is involved
through the regulation of housing,
scholarships, dress standards, spon
soring, and social policies. I hope
you'll allow me to serve these in
terests."
Susan Williams
"When voting for your AWS rep
resentatives consider the qualities
necessary for such leadership. The
most important of these qualities are
responsibility, ability, and interest in
the job. Please keep this in mind
and vote wisely."
