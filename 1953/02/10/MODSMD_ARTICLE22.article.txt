# Thoughts on the New Union
## 
### 
The Union Planning Committee has rolled
into its second week of a two-and-a half fort
night period of interviewing students on their
ideas for the new union.
Before the discussion gets any more involved
v/e would like to dump into the pot our desires
for a new student union, and also a couple of
ideas for using the building area now occupied
by so-called "union" facilities.
i'irst off take the Cellar and the Union res
taurant. You take them because we have avoid
ed eating there ever since our sophomore year.
The perennial moan has been to install some
decent eating place on campus. The perennial
answer has been that the Cellar and Union staff
ure doing the best they can with the limited
funds and structural facilities. So tops on our
list for inclusion in a new union would be din
ing facilities. A coffee shop and combination
banquet hall-restaurant could be designed, pos
sibly sharing a common kitchen and thus par
nig costs.
Then, how about a student lounge? People
may point to the neglected Nitery and say: "No
one would use a lounge; nobody even uses the
lounge Stanford has now." Since the present
Nitery seems much more usable as a livery
stable than as a student lounge, we negate this
argument.
Instead we say that half the men in the stu
dent body and a good proportion of the women
live off campus. What chance have they for
a ieal initiation into student life? A student

lounge could be designed to be a real center
of off-campus students' activities.
By incorporating suitable partitions, not un
like the screens which give infinite variations
112
to the size and utility of rooms in the traditional
Japanese house, the lounge could also be de
signed for use as a ballroom and it could em
body TV viewing rooms.
On other recreational features we add a word
of caution. Billiard tables, bowling alleys, and
the like seem to have more of a novelty lure
than a real place in the union. Dream, if you
will, of a swimming pool for co-educational use
or possibly a few more volleyball courts, but
otherwise stay within the realm of practica
bility.
And for those who may wonder: "Why
couldn't the present buildings be remodeled?"
we have a dual answer. In the first place, there
simply isn't the necessary square footage of
space available. Secondly, there are several
groups that could well use the space which the
erection of a new union would leave available
in the present Union and Cellar buildings.
A well-planned remodeling job and the
ASSU could use all the space now occupied by
the Cellar and the Nitery as offices and meet
ing rooms for its various organizations.
The same is true as far as the Union goes as
a place for locating a badly needed faculty club.
That about sums up our present thoughts on
the subject. They are not intended as the word
of authority, but if they help to crystallize any
one's thinking, we'll be happy.

by so-called "union" facilities.
i'irst off take the Cellar and the Union res
taurant. You take them because we have avoid
ed eating there ever since our sophomore year.
The perennial moan has been to install some
decent eating place on campus. The perennial
answer has been that the Cellar and Union staff
ure doing the best they can with the limited
funds and structural facilities. So tops on our
list for inclusion in a new union would be din
ing facilities. A coffee shop and combination
banquet hall-restaurant could be designed, pos
sibly sharing a common kitchen and thus par
nig costs.
Then, how about a student lounge? People
may point to the neglected Nitery and say: "No
one would use a lounge; nobody even uses the
lounge Stanford has now." Since the present
Nitery seems much more usable as a livery
stable than as a student lounge, we negate this
argument.
Instead we say that half the men in the stu
dent body and a good proportion of the women
live off campus. What chance have they for
a ieal initiation into student life? A student

lounge could be designed to be a real center
of off-campus students' activities.
By incorporating suitable partitions, not un
like the screens which give infinite variations
112
to the size and utility of rooms in the traditional
Japanese house, the lounge could also be de
signed for use as a ballroom and it could em
body TV viewing rooms.
On other recreational features we add a word
of caution. Billiard tables, bowling alleys, and
the like seem to have more of a novelty lure
than a real place in the union. Dream, if you
will, of a swimming pool for co-educational use
or possibly a few more volleyball courts, but
otherwise stay within the realm of practica
bility.
And for those who may wonder: "Why
couldn't the present buildings be remodeled?"
we have a dual answer. In the first place, there
simply isn't the necessary square footage of
space available. Secondly, there are several
groups that could well use the space which the
erection of a new union would leave available
in the present Union and Cellar buildings.
A well-planned remodeling job and the
ASSU could use all the space now occupied by
the Cellar and the Nitery as offices and meet
ing rooms for its various organizations.
The same is true as far as the Union goes as
a place for locating a badly needed faculty club.
That about sums up our present thoughts on
the subject. They are not intended as the word
of authority, but if they help to crystallize any
one's thinking, we'll be happy.
The Union Planning Committee has rolled
into its second week of a two-and-a half fort
night period of interviewing students on their
ideas for the new union.
Before the discussion gets any more involved
v/e would like to dump into the pot our desires
for a new student union, and also a couple of
ideas for using the building area now occupied
by so-called "union" facilities.
