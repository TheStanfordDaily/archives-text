## The
						British Viewpoint on W-a-Merus 
### 
To the Editor:
Having read Miss Tuerk's article about Kirili
Jahnet, the "evicted" Wa-Meru from Tanganyika, 1
am not at all surprised that the U.N. Trusteeship
Council pronounced judgment against his case.
The article was undoubtedly slanted and only at
the end did it make clear that the Wa-Meru's were
unfit for the self government which they claim. Kirili
aid that his people were fit for this self government
and in the very next sentence said that they could not
<lo this without help, and even with this help it would
take a long time. In fact it was quite obvious that it
is better for the British government, under the aus-
I ices of the Trusteeship Council, to continue to lead
thf c people toward a greater realization of political
responsibility.
The Wa-Meru's are a backward tribe using out
d.ited agricultural methods. Their land can only be
developed by more modern means and often this
necessitates the removing of a village. The Wa
"!< i us were offered compensation. Why did they not
I.ike it? Kirili never stated tnat it was inadequate.
I/lost of these tribes are simple people intent only
u]x>n getting u living from their land. They are easily
led by the more educated of their own people—often
firebrands who acquire a glimmering of Democracy
in a Western Country and wish to apply it immediately
amongst their own people, regardless of the conse
quences.
These people often have economic grievances and

the Wa-Meru's are to be admired for not adopting
force in an effort to gain redress. The British Colonial
Office is not the "ogre" that Miss Tuerk paints. It
does not accuse agitator of being a Communist. Indeed
it has denied that the Mau-Mau movement is Com
munist inspired.
One gets the impression that British troops razed
the village to the ground in true "oradour" fashion.
Actually the people v/ere given a lime limit to leave
their village which they refused to do. No one was
killed by bullets from British guns.
The Wa-Meru's may have a true grievance. The
British Colonial Office is inquiring into the matter and
should not be maligned with such virulence as Kirili
uses. Like most of his kind he seems unable to see
the other side of the question.
Your obedient servant,

(Ed. note: Reader Hall is an ASSU scholar from
England. Two other students, disturbed hy Miss
Tuerk's article, have written to various people, in
cluding British Colonial Office, to find out more of
the background on the case. Perhaps the question
will he resolved by the answers to their letters.)
(Ed. note: In addition to those letters printed in
this column, the editor has in the past few days
received a number of letters with no signature or
with so little signature that identification was im
possible. Though these letters were worthwhile,
policy prevents (heir publication.)
