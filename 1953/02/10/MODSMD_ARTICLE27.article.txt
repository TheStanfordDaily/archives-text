Rocky Harris has had his eye
on you. If you're one of thou
sands who have donned a white
blouse or a shirt and tie for a
Quad photo, he has glanced at
you to make sure you don't have
a black spot on your left cheek
or a shadow over one eye.
Sorting through thousands of in
dividual and group pictures is only
part of Roeky's job as editor of the
195.1 Quad. He spends a minimum
of 20 hours a week supervising the
four sections of the Quad —academ-
ics, activities, athletics, and living
groups.
He has to co-ordinate this work
with Keith Cole Studios in Menlo
Park and the California Art and
Engraving Company in Berkeley,
which is publishing the book. To
add to his problems, the cover wa.s
designed in Los Angeles.
Most of his worries stem from
lark of co-operation of campus
organizations. "Too often we send
a photographer to an organization
meeting, only to have him return
empty handed. There weren't
enough people there to take the
picture."
Rocky urged interested photogra
phers to join the staff. At present
the Quad has only seven photogra
phers to handle the taking of pic
tures and darkroom work.
This year's Quad has been de
signed around the general theme of
the Stanford arch. The cover will
show a large arch with a colored
shot of the library and Hoover
Tower in the background.
"Nothing is secret about the
Quad," Rocky said. "Anyone inter
ested in looking through the dum
my can do so at any time."
The book will contain 424 pages,
including 17 two-color pages. They
will be delivered here on June 1.
'112 he first work on the 1953 Quad
was done last April, when the
stalf elected Rocky editor. He se
lected his editorial hoard: Brooks

Cowgill, managing editor; asso
ciate editors Martha Nell Tucker,
Janet Cline, Jon Stuffleheem, and
Kin Durant.
Fall quarter presented the annual
problem of the Frosh Book. Work
on the Quad became secondary to
photographing the Class of '56. The
result was a tremendous success,
and 1,400 Frosh Books were sold
for one dollar each.
Rocky and his staff of 30 see that
the Quad is produced. Business
manager Bob McDonald has to
make sure they're sold.
This year 3,300 Quads have been
ordered and are on sale for $7.
"When these are sold," he said,
"that will be all. We won't order
any more."
Boh also has charge of the
Quad's $38,000 budget."The Quad
doesn't receive any University
funds, ami it's up to us to make
or break." So far sales have gone
faster than last year, and a sell
out is expected.
After the last picture has been
checked and the dummy shipped
of! to Berkeley, the Quad stall will
celebrate in traditional Stanford
fashion—a banquet at L'Ommie's.

—195.*} Quad editor
Rocky Harris has had his eye
on you. If you're one of thou
sands who have donned a white
blouse or a shirt and tie for a
Quad photo, he has glanced at
you to make sure you don't have
a black spot on your left cheek
or a shadow over one eye.
Sorting through thousands of in
dividual and group pictures is only
part of Roeky's job as editor of the
195.1 Quad. He spends a minimum
of 20 hours a week supervising the
four sections of the Quad —academ-
ics, activities, athletics, and living
groups.
He has to co-ordinate this work
with Keith Cole Studios in Menlo
Park and the California Art and
Engraving Company in Berkeley,
which is publishing the book. To
add to his problems, the cover wa.s
designed in Los Angeles.
Most of his worries stem from
lark of co-operation of campus
organizations. "Too often we send
a photographer to an organization
meeting, only to have him return
empty handed. There weren't
enough people there to take the
picture."
Rocky urged interested photogra
phers to join the staff. At present
the Quad has only seven photogra
phers to handle the taking of pic
tures and darkroom work.
This year's Quad has been de
signed around the general theme of
the Stanford arch. The cover will
show a large arch with a colored
shot of the library and Hoover
Tower in the background.
"Nothing is secret about the
Quad," Rocky said. "Anyone inter
ested in looking through the dum
my can do so at any time."
The book will contain 424 pages,
including 17 two-color pages. They
will be delivered here on June 1.
'112 he first work on the 1953 Quad
was done last April, when the
stalf elected Rocky editor. He se
lected his editorial hoard: Brooks

Cowgill, managing editor; asso
ciate editors Martha Nell Tucker,
Janet Cline, Jon Stuffleheem, and
Kin Durant.
Fall quarter presented the annual
problem of the Frosh Book. Work
on the Quad became secondary to
photographing the Class of '56. The
result was a tremendous success,
and 1,400 Frosh Books were sold
for one dollar each.
Rocky and his staff of 30 see that
the Quad is produced. Business
manager Bob McDonald has to
make sure they're sold.
This year 3,300 Quads have been
ordered and are on sale for $7.
"When these are sold," he said,
"that will be all. We won't order
any more."
Boh also has charge of the
Quad's $38,000 budget."The Quad
doesn't receive any University
funds, ami it's up to us to make
or break." So far sales have gone
faster than last year, and a sell
out is expected.
After the last picture has been
checked and the dummy shipped
of! to Berkeley, the Quad stall will
celebrate in traditional Stanford
fashion—a banquet at L'Ommie's.
