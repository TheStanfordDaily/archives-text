# POT SHOTSâ€”Mike Hudson
## Fight On for Old SC! 
### 
Elmer Wilhoite, USC's All-American guard (except in the Stanford and
Notre Dame games) has decided to bypass a football career for the prize
ring.. He is being managed by Fidel La Qarba, ex-flyweight champion of
the world and a Stanford man.
We talked to boxing coach Ray Lunny and Jake Irwin who fought
here when La Barha went to Stanford (o find out about the greatest boxer
on the Farm and one of the few champs who ever went to college. Both
agreed that he was one of the classiest little fighters of all time. I.tinny
pointed out that lie was champion when there were at least fifty great
flyweights in America alone. Now there are none in America and about
live in the world.
David vs.
La Barha had beaten most of the world's great fighters when he came
to Stanford in 19215. He naturally couldn't fight in competition here, but he
donated his services as Coach. Once a rotund heavyweight named Wilson
decided to prove that a mediocre big man could beat a good little man.
Alter a brief flurry, La Barba sat Wilson on the back of his lap with a right
to the button.

Irwin, who was seconded by La
Barba when lie fought here, re
members La Barha as a "high-type
man and a credit to boxing." Both
Lunny and Irwin agree that Will
hoi te must have something if a
crafty ring veteran like La Barha
is willing to invest his time with
him.
While we had Lunny cornered we
asked him to name a winner in the
Chuck Davey-Kid Gavilan welter
weight title fight which will be tele
vised tomorrow night. Lunny sides
with the experts and against the mul
titudes by picking Gavillan to stop
Davey. However, he doesn't give the
usual reason that Davey is too green
lor Gavilan and still a growing boy.
He points out that Davey had over
100 AAU bouts as well as his fights

in college and 38 pro encounters. Furthermore, he points out that
Duvey is a mature 26. He is a veteran fighter. Lunny simply picks Gavilan
becaues he thinks he is the superior fighter. Davey hasn't met any good
fighter yet. This does not mean that Davey doesn't deserve a shot at the
title, however. "Pro boxing is a money proposition, and when you're a
colorful and good fighter, you're bound to be pushed to the top."
In a brief glance at the other weight divisions, Lunny bemoaned the
current ludicrous tournament going on in the middleweight division be
tween ten or twelve so-so fighters for the title. "Bobo Olson and Handy
Turpin obviously should fight for the title.
M olcott-Marciano
In the heavyweight division, Luny picks Rocky Marciano to make quick
work of Joe Wolcott in their next meetirtg in April. "A boxer is ofie thing
thai definitely does not improve with age."
Lunny refused to compare Marciano to the great heavyweights of the
past. "However," he warned, "don't let itfarciano's lack of boxing ability
fool you, he's got a punch, he can take a puuch, and he loves to fight
These things make up over 95 percent of any fighter."
Finally, we asked him about the Stanford team. He named light-heavy
weight Bob Baldocchi as his best fighter. Baldocchi has backed up his
coach's judgment by winning his two fights this year. Lunny rates him
a small chance of winning the PCI tourney. Other Stanford boxers who may
fight in this all-college tourney include Gary Sievert in the 132 lb. class
and Jack Owens in the 147-lb. bracket.

LUNNY
Elmer Wilhoite, USC's All-American guard (except in the Stanford and
Notre Dame games) has decided to bypass a football career for the prize
ring.. He is being managed by Fidel La Qarba, ex-flyweight champion of
the world and a Stanford man.
We talked to boxing coach Ray Lunny and Jake Irwin who fought
here when La Barha went to Stanford (o find out about the greatest boxer
on the Farm and one of the few champs who ever went to college. Both
agreed that he was one of the classiest little fighters of all time. I.tinny
pointed out that lie was champion when there were at least fifty great
flyweights in America alone. Now there are none in America and about
live in the world.
David vs.
La Barha had beaten most of the world's great fighters when he came
to Stanford in 19215. He naturally couldn't fight in competition here, but he
donated his services as Coach. Once a rotund heavyweight named Wilson
decided to prove that a mediocre big man could beat a good little man.
Alter a brief flurry, La Barba sat Wilson on the back of his lap with a right
to the button.

Irwin, who was seconded by La
Barba when lie fought here, re
members La Barha as a "high-type
man and a credit to boxing." Both
Lunny and Irwin agree that Will
hoi te must have something if a
crafty ring veteran like La Barha
is willing to invest his time with
him.
While we had Lunny cornered we
asked him to name a winner in the
Chuck Davey-Kid Gavilan welter
weight title fight which will be tele
vised tomorrow night. Lunny sides
with the experts and against the mul
titudes by picking Gavillan to stop
Davey. However, he doesn't give the
usual reason that Davey is too green
lor Gavilan and still a growing boy.
He points out that Davey had over
100 AAU bouts as well as his fights

in college and 38 pro encounters. Furthermore, he points out that
Duvey is a mature 26. He is a veteran fighter. Lunny simply picks Gavilan
becaues he thinks he is the superior fighter. Davey hasn't met any good
fighter yet. This does not mean that Davey doesn't deserve a shot at the
title, however. "Pro boxing is a money proposition, and when you're a
colorful and good fighter, you're bound to be pushed to the top."
In a brief glance at the other weight divisions, Lunny bemoaned the
current ludicrous tournament going on in the middleweight division be
tween ten or twelve so-so fighters for the title. "Bobo Olson and Handy
Turpin obviously should fight for the title.
M olcott-Marciano
In the heavyweight division, Luny picks Rocky Marciano to make quick
work of Joe Wolcott in their next meetirtg in April. "A boxer is ofie thing
thai definitely does not improve with age."
Lunny refused to compare Marciano to the great heavyweights of the
past. "However," he warned, "don't let itfarciano's lack of boxing ability
fool you, he's got a punch, he can take a puuch, and he loves to fight
These things make up over 95 percent of any fighter."
Finally, we asked him about the Stanford team. He named light-heavy
weight Bob Baldocchi as his best fighter. Baldocchi has backed up his
coach's judgment by winning his two fights this year. Lunny rates him
a small chance of winning the PCI tourney. Other Stanford boxers who may
fight in this all-college tourney include Gary Sievert in the 132 lb. class
and Jack Owens in the 147-lb. bracket.
