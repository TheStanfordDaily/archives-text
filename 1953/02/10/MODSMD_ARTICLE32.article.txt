# Indians Prep To Resume FCC Cage Wars
## 
### 
After a three-week layoff, South
ern Division teams return to their
PCC cage wars this weekend.
Stanford, looking better with each
yame and presently riding the crest
of a three-game win streak, will hit
the road for the Southland for a
twin bill against the USC Trojans.
Meanwhile, California's Golden
Bears will play host to the UCLA
Bruins. By winning both games
the Bears would all hut mathe
matically cinch the PCC crown.
The Bruins, title winners for the
last four seasons, will be under
pressure to give Cal u double dos
ing to remain in the race. The Bear
already boast two wins over the
Bruins this season .
Coach Bob Burnett's Indians wili
be seeking to pull themselves out
of the cellar at the second-place

Trojans' expense. Despite having
lost two toughies to USC earlier
this season, the Cards are a good
bet to come through with at least a
split.
Since its last meeting with Troy
Stanford has shown plenty of
improvement, especially from
George Zaninovich and Russ
Lawler.
Statistics recently released by
Burnett show that in its first 19
games Stanford has scored only 16
fewer field goals than its opponents.
But on the foul line the opposition
has tanked 84 more buckets, or 4.4
per game.
The Indians have a better per
centage from the line but have
given their opponents too many
tries.
