LEFTY, NO LESS-Stanford's Russ Lawler gets off one of his
newly developed left handed hooks despite the close guarding
of Bradley's Dick Peterson (32) and Dick Goelzer (35). Lawler,
one of the most improved players on the squad, is expected to
give the USC Trojans plenty of trouble this weekend with his
new weapon. â€”Daily photo by Glenn Erickson
