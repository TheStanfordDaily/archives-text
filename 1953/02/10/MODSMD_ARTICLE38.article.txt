Encina sW's basketball team
I breezed by a much 112 horter but hus
tling T'aamrack ball club in
| intramural action last night in the
; Pavilion. The Encina team, which
j had a height advantage of over six I
j inches per man, took a command- j
| ing lead from tho opening whistle \
I and led all the way.
Buzz Nason countered on four
quick jump shots and tip-ins in the :
second half to pace the winners, but
Wayne Tilley overshadowed Na
son's efforts with deadeye shooting
from everywhere on the court. He
garnered 18 points to lead both
i teams. Half-time score favored the
j Encina team, 14-4.
NaÂ»on, Bob Ziegler, and Jack
j Krausharr proivded (he differ
j ence between the two ball clubs
b.v cont r o 11 in g both boards
throughout most of the game.
Doug Warner was the mainspring
that put the team ahead to stay in
the first half. Two times in that pe
riod he grabbed rebounds and
stuffed the ball right back in the
basket. Jack Kraushaar also played
his best in this period, both in re
bounding well and on jump shots
from the corner.
The Tamarack team threw a scare
into the taller boys from Encina
momentarily in the second half with
j Tilley leading the way. Their hustle
and speed helped them to narrow
the gap, but 10 points was as close
as they could get. Bob Kimura con
nected most of his eight points dur
ing this period to help Tilley.
