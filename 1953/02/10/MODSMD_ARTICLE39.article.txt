# Vern Stephens Swapped
## 
### 
Vern Stephens, veteran third
baseman and shortstop, was today
traded to the Chicago White Sox
for pitchers Hector Brown, Marv
Grissom, and Bill Kennedy.
The stubby infielder's lone - ball

hitting led the St
Louis Browns to
a pennant in 194-!
In 1947, he was
traded 10 the Bed
Sox.
Batting clean
up for the Bosox

he averaged about «>0 home runs a
year as he and Ted Williams formed
a murderous one-two combination.
In 1949, be bombed 39 homers and
knocked in 159 runs as the Red
Sox lost the pennant on the last day
of the season.
In recent years, Stephens has
been bothered by bad legs but he
still has been getting his share of

homers. He is the only shortstop
in the history of the game to hit
over 240 homers.
The acquisition of Stephens
gives the White Sox a strong
front line infield with the Ameri
can League hitting champ Ferris
Fain at first liase. valuable Nellie
Fox at second, the smooth fielding
( liico Carrasquel at short, and
Stephens at third.
However, the sagging Chisox
pitching staff took a turn for the
worse with the loss of Brown, Gris
som, and Kennedy. Grissom is a
fair front line hurler, while Brown
and Kennedy are young pitchers
who might become great in the fu
ture.
The deal adds up to an attempt
for a pennant this year by the
White; Sox, while Boston is rebuild
ing for the future.—M. H.
