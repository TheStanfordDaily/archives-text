WASHINGTON, Feb. 9 (UP) â€” I
The Senate Elections subcommittee |
today branded as forgeries two j
hitherto unpublished campaign doc
uments aimed at discrediting Vice-
President Richard M. Nixon by
linking him with an alleged oil in
dustry payofT.
Subcommittee Chairman Frank
A. Barrett (R., Wyo.) said the files

I on the case have been turned over
| to the Justice Department and the
| FBI with a request that they in
vestigate possible law violations.
Nixon himself asked the FBI ear
lier to investigate. The California
Republican also had asked the elec
tions group to look into the photo
stats of letters which the subcom
mittee today labeled "spurious."
