# THE 						PERENNIAL PARKING PROBLEM
## Pink Slips Grace Campus 
### PAT KING 
What's the difference between walking or driving your car to
your 8 o'clock class every morning?
Possibly two dollars; that's what those pink slips under so many
windshield wipers mean. Chances are that if you haven't gotten
one in the past, you'll get one sometime in the future.

The rapid rise in the number of
cars on the campus has resulted in
frustrated drivers and a harassed
police force. More than 4,000 stu
dent and faculty cars are registered
with Police Chief Gordon Davis. In
the general parking area around
Quad there are parking spaces
available for 3,200 cars. Many stu
dents drive to class and numerous
visitors drive on campus every day.
The result is obvious.
According to Chief Davis, the
whole problem of parking at
Stanford is due to "needless op
eration of cars right here on cam
pus. Students who ordinarily
walk two or three blocks in a city
will prefer to drive that same dis
tance to class. They fill all spaces
close to Quad early in the morn
ing, lcavng off - campus students
and visitors to search for distant
or illegal parking areas."
The worst traffic jams occur be
tween classes. Many drivers even
have an aversion to walking across
Quad. They dash from classes to
their cars, and cause a traffic tie-up
as they drive to the other side of
Quad. Often they can't find an
other place to park, and for their
pains they are rewarded with a
ticket.
Davis also emphasized that
tickets will be given for cars that

take up two spaces or arc parked
so as to obstruct traffic.
The administration is trying to
relieve this problem by constructing
several new parking areas. The new
lot behind the library will hold 85
fcars, and facilities behind the tem
porary buildings and Stern Hall
have been expanded.
But extensive improvements
are restricted by limited funds,
and University money is more
urgently needed in other projects.
Chief Davis suggested that facili
ties could be expanded if car own
ers paid a small registration fee.
This money would be earmarked for
new parking lots or possibly a ga
rage. "The University would be able
to map out a long-range program
if it could count on a continued
supply of money for the project,"
he added.
The "critical parking problem"
is nothing new to Chief Davis. "I
can remember when there were
only 500 cars on campus," he
smiled, "and people complained
about the lack of parking space
even then."
Approximately 200 parking spaces
close to Quad are reserved for fac
ulty and physically handicapped
students. These areas are plainly

marked, and only cars with black
or red-black stickers are allowed
to use them.
Automobile owners are reminded
that they must obtain a registration
sticker from the Police Department
for every car operated at Stanford.
Piegistration stickers serve as a
source of information for police
files, and protect the restricted and
reserved parking areas.

about the lack of parking space
even then."
Approximately 200 parking spaces
close to Quad are reserved for fac
ulty and physically handicapped
students. These areas are plainly

marked, and only cars with black
or red-black stickers are allowed
to use them.
Automobile owners are reminded
that they must obtain a registration
sticker from the Police Department
for every car operated at Stanford.
Piegistration stickers serve as a
source of information for police
files, and protect the restricted and
reserved parking areas.

What's the difference between walking or driving your car to
your 8 o'clock class every morning?
Possibly two dollars; that's what those pink slips under so many
windshield wipers mean. Chances are that if you haven't gotten
one in the past, you'll get one sometime in the future.

The rapid rise in the number of
cars on the campus has resulted in
frustrated drivers and a harassed
police force. More than 4,000 stu
dent and faculty cars are registered
with Police Chief Gordon Davis. In
the general parking area around
Quad there are parking spaces
available for 3,200 cars. Many stu
dents drive to class and numerous
visitors drive on campus every day.
The result is obvious.
According to Chief Davis, the
whole problem of parking at
Stanford is due to "needless op
eration of cars right here on cam
pus. Students who ordinarily
walk two or three blocks in a city
will prefer to drive that same dis
tance to class. They fill all spaces
close to Quad early in the morn
ing, lcavng off - campus students
and visitors to search for distant
or illegal parking areas."
The worst traffic jams occur be
tween classes. Many drivers even
have an aversion to walking across
Quad. They dash from classes to
their cars, and cause a traffic tie-up
as they drive to the other side of
Quad. Often they can't find an
other place to park, and for their
pains they are rewarded with a
ticket.
Davis also emphasized that
tickets will be given for cars that

take up two spaces or arc parked
so as to obstruct traffic.
The administration is trying to
relieve this problem by constructing
several new parking areas. The new
lot behind the library will hold 85
fcars, and facilities behind the tem
porary buildings and Stern Hall
have been expanded.
But extensive improvements
are restricted by limited funds,
and University money is more
urgently needed in other projects.
Chief Davis suggested that facili
ties could be expanded if car own
ers paid a small registration fee.
This money would be earmarked for
new parking lots or possibly a ga
rage. "The University would be able
to map out a long-range program
if it could count on a continued
supply of money for the project,"
he added.
The "critical parking problem"
is nothing new to Chief Davis. "I
can remember when there were
only 500 cars on campus," he
smiled, "and people complained
about the lack of parking space
even then."
