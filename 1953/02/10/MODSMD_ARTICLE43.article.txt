## New Med Plan To Be Offered 
### 
A new form of prepaid medical
care to cover all employees of Stan
ford University will be proposed at
a meeting of University personnel
this afternoon at 4:30 in Cubberley
Auditorium.
The plan is sponsored by the
Stanford chapter of the American
Association of University Profes
sors. It was worked out by the As
soiation's Faculty Health Commit
tee in conjunction with the Palo
Alto Clinic, which has been operat
ing the Health Service for Stanford
students since 1946.
Professor Philip W. Harsh, presi
dent of the chapter, appointed the
committee last year to study vari
ous plans for health and accident
coverage. Committee members are
Professor John W. Dodds, Hubert
C. Heffner, Oliver E. Byrd, and C.
Langdon White.
In another health move, Stanford
employees enrolled in the Blue
Cross Hospital Plan were recently
informed of increased coverage un
der this program. Hospital benefits
were extended from 21 to 70 days,
among other px*ovisions.
