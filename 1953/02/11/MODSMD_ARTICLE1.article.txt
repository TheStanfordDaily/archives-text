Eighth Army," Van Fleet said the
Communists were "defeated and
they knew it" in the spring of
10ftI. "I»nt the years arc passing \
and lives are still being lost each
day."
His concern for the mounting
casualty lists from 20 months of
indecisive fighting on the 155-
inile front was tempered with the
hope that President Eisenhower's
strong Asia policy will bring
peace.
"As soldiers we can only do our
duly and obey orders," be said.
"But we bave faith that President
Eisenhower will find the way to
bring peace to Korea as well as to
the rest of the world."

far" in his carefully worded state
ment, a source close to the general
said.
"He has some other things to say
and he will say them when lie re
turns to the United States," the
source said.

My to Tokyo after lite change of
command ceremonies for a final
meeting with (ien. Mark Clark,
supreme commander for the Far
Fast. Van Fleet is expected to
