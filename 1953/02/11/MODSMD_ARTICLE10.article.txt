# Symphony To Present US Premiere
## 
### 
The first performance in the United
States of Richard Strauss' "Wan
derer's Song to the Storm" will be
included in the concert tomorrow
night at 8:30 in Memorial Audito
rium.
The Stanford Chorus, under the
direction of Harold C. Schmidt, will
present the 19th Century composition
as part of a program given by the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra,
conducted by Victor de Sabata.
Strauss is not well-known for his
choral compositions and those
which he did write are rarely pre
sented because of their high per
formance standards. Like the
works of Wagner and other com
posers of the last century, "Wan
derer's Song to the Storm" is
powerful and heavy, requiring a
large orchestra and chorus to pre
sent it.
The choral music is scored for six
parts, two more than the ordinary
four, giving extra heavy bass and
soprano sections.
"With the large San Francisco
Symphony and the 168-member
chorus giving this work, the perform
ance should result in an outstanding
and worthwhile musical evening,"
Schmidt said.
One of the orchestral selections
will feature tenor Leonard Weeks,
a senior majoring in music, who
will sing "La Giara" by Casella.
The orchestra, under de Sabata,
will also play pieces by Stravinsky,
Berlioz, and Richard Strauss.
Tickets are on sale at the Me
morial Hall Box Office (DA 3-0665)
and the Peninsula Box Office in Palo
Alto (DA 2-2122) for $2.50, $2.00,
and $1.50.
