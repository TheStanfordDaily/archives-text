LAST MINUTE PLANS are being made for the Student Workshop by Amber Spinning, Ann Irvine,
and Dick Weismann, planning committee for the Workshop, which will be Saturday. Before final
arrangements can be made they must have the list of delegates to the workshop for all campus or
ganizations. These lists may be turned in to the YWCA office anytime today. Dick Weismann
and Miss Adele Strogen will be guest speakers for the occasion, and five student leaders will con
duct the discussion groups. â€”Daily photo by Roy Broun
