BULLETIN

HONG KONG, Wednesday,
Feb. 11 (UP) —Reports of small
but sharp naval actions ofT the
Red China mainland filtered
into this British outpost today
following President Eisenhow
er's order taking the wraps oil
the Chinese Nationalists on
Formosa.

WASHINGTON, Feb. JO (UP)
- Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles said today as far as he
knows President Eisenhower has
no plan to blockade Communist
China, bomb Manchuria or Chi
nese railways, or drop the atomic
bomb in Korea.
Simultaneously, Sen. John J.
Sparkman (D-Ala.) reported that
Gen. Omar N. Bradley still holds
"substantially the same" position on
a naval blockade as he did during the
celebrated "Mac Arthur hearings"—
that it would "materially increase
the chance" of World War 111.
Bradley also was said to have as
sured senators that this country is
"stepping up" arms to Chiang Kai
shek's Chinese Nationalist troops on
Formosa — recently freed by Mr.
Eisenhower to attack the mainland.
Dulles, fresh from a European tour
and a conference with Mr. Eisen
hower, and Bradley, chairman of the
joint chiefs of staff, testified at closed
sessions of the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee. Senators gave re
porters a fill-in on parts of then
testimony.
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey (D-
Minn.) said Dulles told the com
mittee he knows of no plan to
blockade the China coast as some
members of Congress have been
demanding. Dulles also knew of no
plan to bomb Manchuria or use l! --
A-bomb in Korea, Humphrey said.
Dulles told the Committee, how
ever, that a major plank in the ad
ministration's new Korean war
policy is to keep the Communists
"guessing" as to the next move by
this country. Therefore, he "closed
no doors" on any future action.
In reviewing the Far East situation
for the Committee, Bradley empha -
sized repeatedly that the question ol
a blockade "is a high policy matter
which must be determined by the
president."
