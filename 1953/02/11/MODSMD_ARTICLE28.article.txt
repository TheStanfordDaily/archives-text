### 
In yesterday's Daily, an article appeared re
porting a police crackdown on incorrect park
ing — a too lreguent appearance on Stanford
roads.
Therefore, we would make two reguests:
1. The police deparment start backing up
their words and really hand out citations con
sistently to those individuals who have the un
< ;>uy ability to take up anywhere from one and

a half to two parking spaces.
2. Stanford students and professors learn
how to park. There are too many individuals
who need an elementary course in this subject
—as evidenced by the fact that yesterday after
noon in one block we saw four parking places
unuseable because of some car owner's
thoughtlessness. And not a single car was
cited.—Walt Menninqer
