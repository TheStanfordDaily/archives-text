# CAMPUS OPINION
## My Kingdom for a House 
### 
I pity the fate of the frosh iri Stern,
He sure has got it bad.
So many tilings to trouble him,
But think of the homeless grad.
Think, for a bit, of the Village .soph.
My heart goes out to the lad.
He'll be in Toyon next fall lor sure,
But not the homeless grad.
The eating club or fraternity man
Should never feel too bad.
For they have somewhere to rest their heads

But. not the homeless grad.
The married student with wife and kids
May find a house in an ad.
His plumbing may not be the very best,
But think of the homeless grad.
Most everywhere, in this land of ours,
There's lots of room to be had.
And someday, here, on our very own Farm,
They'll build a dorm for the grad.
