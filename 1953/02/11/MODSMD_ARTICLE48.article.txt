# You can elect an electronic future at GM
## 
### 
The engineers in the picture are using ;i very
simple looking little instrument called the
Surfa-Gage.
Yet it is one of the most important contribu
tions of the electronic age to quantity produc
tion of quality products.
For the Surfa-Gage allows production engi
neers to measure the surface of a part to
determine the part's conformance to specified
smoothness — within micro-inches — and thus
insure greater wearing qualities.
Wc mention the Surfa-Gage here as just one
example of the continuous General Motors
developments in the field of electronics—from
new airplane bombsights and tank range
finders to improved car ignition systems,
radios and controls for many manufacturing
processes.
For we want the soon-to-be-graduated elec
trical engineer to know that he will find as
wide a latitude for his training at GM as will
the mechanical or metallurgical engineering
student.
After all, the development of modern GM
products—of all kinds—requires the develop
ment of tools to build those products. And this
means a tremendous amount of work in elec
trical engineering —from the research lab to
the production line.
So to the electrical engineer as to engineers
in the other categories listed at right—we say
there may well be a job with an interesting
future for you at GM. Why not ask your
College Placement Office to arrange a meeting
for you with the GM College llepresentative
the next time he visits your campus. Or drop
us a line.
