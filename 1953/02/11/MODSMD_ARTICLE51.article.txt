# Matmen Seek Second Win Over Gators Tonight
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
Stanford's bicep boys hope to collect win number three tonight
as the Card grapplers face a spirited but inexperienced San Fran
cisco State squad in the Encina Gym at 7:30.
The Cards faced the Gators earlier in the season and proceeded
to blank the city boys 34-0 in a meet that saw Stanford men the

victors right down the line.
At 123, Steve Gee will go against
an as yet unnamed opponent. Gee, in
his first year out for the sport, is
short on experience but is picking up
every week.
In the KM)-lb. class, Jim Hutch
inson will go against Phil Lyons,
twin In-other of Ollie Lyons, and a
top contender for the PCI crown
in the division. Lyons wrestled at
1.17 in his last bout with the Cards
and was decisioned by Stanford's
phenominal George Kussell, 8-3.
Ollie Lyons, Stanford's unbeaten
130-pounder, was forced to quit the
sport in mid-season because of a
bad shoulder. Hutchinson, inex
perienced but learning all the time,
will be a heavy underdog.
At 137, the Gators will pick some
one to be "sacrificed" to George Rus
sell, Stanford's "white hope" for a

PCI crown. Russell, last year's
< hump, is undefeated except for a
draw against Dick Robinson of Sail
Diego State, PCI champ from two
years back.
Bruce Bailey, Stanford's law stu
dent-midshipman-wrestler, will try
for another win against John Wilson.
Bob Jensen, going at this weight the
last time out against the Gators, de
cisioned Wilson in a close match.
At 157, Ken James will try for
his second win of the season against
the same man who made victory
number one.
In the Ki7 division, Jack Ogelsby,
the crowd pleasing, always smiling
captain of the wrestlers will go
against Joe Corning, a former
Golden Gloves champ with much
mat experience. Corning was
pinned by Bob Keatie, second man

in the 1(»7 division, last time out.
At 177, Pat Madden the Kentucky
strong man, will be a heavy favorite
to maul his opponent again. Madden,
on of the better wrestlers on the
coast, has lost to only one man so
lar this season.
The heavyweight division will see
A 1 Colton matoh wits, muscle, and
balance with another opponent as yet
unnamed. In the last match, the
Gators forfeited this class. Colton. a
"light" 183 for a heavyweight, has
been hampered continually by lack
of weight all sen«*on.
The wrc tiers 'have only three
more meets after tonight. They
meet Alameda NAS again at Ala
meda on Friday Feb. 13th, San
Qnentln there on Thursday, Feb.
19, and Cal's rugged Boars here
on Wednesday, Feb. 24.
These last matches are warmups
tor the big PCI meet to be held at
San Diego on March 12 and 13. Stan
ford will probably send Ogelsby,
James, Russell. Beatie, and Madden.
Ogelsby, who placed third last
year at 177, will try to move up at
IG7.
Kussell will have to battle San
Diego State's I'obinson to retain
bis 137 crown. His injured rib
might be the deciding factor.
Stanford's other big chance will be
Pat Madden. If he can get over San
Tose State's 177er he might just go
all the way. Holding the meet dur
ing dead week might just hold Mad
den back from going.
Beatie, a boy with a bad knee who
jan be awfully hot at times, also
stands a chance.

perienced but learning all the time,
will be a heavy underdog.
At 137, the Gators will pick some
one to be "sacrificed" to George Rus
sell, Stanford's "white hope" for a

PCI crown. Russell, last year's
< hump, is undefeated except for a
draw against Dick Robinson of Sail
Diego State, PCI champ from two
years back.
Bruce Bailey, Stanford's law stu
dent-midshipman-wrestler, will try
for another win against John Wilson.
Bob Jensen, going at this weight the

the same man who made victory
number one.
In the Ki7 division, Jack Ogelsby,
the crowd pleasing, always smiling
captain of the wrestlers will go
against Joe Corning, a former
Golden Gloves champ with much
mat experience. Corning was
pinned by Bob Keatie, second man

in the 1(»7 division, last time out.
At 177, Pat Madden the Kentucky
strong man, will be a heavy favorite
to maul his opponent again. Madden,
on of the better wrestlers on the
coast, has lost to only one man so
lar this season.
The heavyweight division will see
A 1 Colton matoh wits, muscle, and
balance with another opponent as yet

been hampered continually by lack
of weight all sen«*on.

on Wednesday, Feb. 24.
These last matches are warmups
tor the big PCI meet to be held at

Ogelsby, who placed third last
year at 177, will try to move up at
IG7.
Kussell will have to battle San
Diego State's I'obinson to retain
bis 137 crown. His injured rib
might be the deciding factor.
Stanford's other big chance will be
Pat Madden. If he can get over San
Tose State's 177er he might just go
all the way. Holding the meet dur
ing dead week might just hold Mad
den back from going.
Beatie, a boy with a bad knee who
jan be awfully hot at times, also
stands a chance.
