## 
### 
CHICAGO, Feb. 10 (UP) â€”Wel-
terweight champion Kid Gavilan,
who meets college graduate Chuck
Davey tomorrow night at Chicago
Stadium in a title fight, remained a
solid 12-5 favorite to retain his
crown despite an apparent weight
problem.
Gavilan and his handlers scofled
at reports that he was having diffi
culties paring down to the 147-

pound weight limit, but would not :
let anyone outside of their entou- !
rage see the scales.
The Illinois Athletic Commis
sion warned Gavilan that if he
did not meet the weight require
ments the title would be vacated
and tomorrow's fight would be
come a non-title allair.
Regardless of. his weight, Gavilan |
appeared lit and trim as he waltzed
through four rounds with sparring
opponents yesterday.
