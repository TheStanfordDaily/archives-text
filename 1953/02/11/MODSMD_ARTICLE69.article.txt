# A 						Phi O—Always Ready To Help in Time of Need
## 
### R.G. MANSFIELD 
Stanford's Zeta chapter of Alpha Phi Omega, national service
fraternity, this week is participating in commemoration of Boy
Scout week by launching its 1952 pledge drive.
"We really shouldn't call it pledging," said John Gessford, A
Phi O vice-president, at a recent meeting of the chapter, "because

joining A Phi O doesn't keep you'
out of any other fraternity or club.
A Phi O crosses all lines and draws
members from all organizations."
Alpha Phi Omega was founded na
tionally in 1925, and has grown until
today it has more than 50 chapters
on campuses across the country. Zeta
chapter was founded in 1928, the
sixth chapter to be organized, and has
been active at Stanford ever since,
except during the war years.
At Stanford, the chapter supplies
ushers for campus theatrical produc
tions, participates in local charity
drives, assists with local Boy Scout
ti'oops, and runs various projects of
its own on campus.
One of the chapter's biggest jobs
is the recently-founded Book Ex
change. This Exchange serves as
agent for students who wish to
sell text books, opening at the
beginning of each quarter for three
or four days. Save for the time last
spring when a student, displeased
with the system, sued the Book
Exchange for $4.20, this activity
has been increasingly successful.
When Dr. Ralph Bunche presided
at a model assembly of the United
Nations on campus in the spring of
1951, A Phi O members helped out.
They will also assist the lIR at this
week's conference. The chapter reg
ularly runs a "rides box" to get
rides home and back for students at
vacations. In 1950, A Phi O stood
by to '"guard" Hoover Tower Sun
day afternoons, when it was proposed
that the Tower be opened to the
public at that time.
The chapter's most recent project
has been a rides box in co-opera
tion with the Ski Club, to arrange
rides to ski areas during the season.
This box is located on the Ski Club
bulletin board near the ASSU of
fice. Additional Daily boxes were
also recently built and installed by
A Phi O.
Only prerequisites for membership
in A Phi O are previous Boy Scout
membership and an active interest
in giving service.

Stanford's Zeta chapter of Alpha Phi Omega, national service
fraternity, this week is participating in commemoration of Boy
Scout week by launching its 1952 pledge drive.
"We really shouldn't call it pledging," said John Gessford, A
Phi O vice-president, at a recent meeting of the chapter, "because

joining A Phi O doesn't keep you'
out of any other fraternity or club.
A Phi O crosses all lines and draws
members from all organizations."
Alpha Phi Omega was founded na
tionally in 1925, and has grown until
today it has more than 50 chapters
on campuses across the country. Zeta
chapter was founded in 1928, the
sixth chapter to be organized, and has
been active at Stanford ever since,
except during the war years.
At Stanford, the chapter supplies
ushers for campus theatrical produc
tions, participates in local charity
drives, assists with local Boy Scout
ti'oops, and runs various projects of
its own on campus.
One of the chapter's biggest jobs
is the recently-founded Book Ex
change. This Exchange serves as
agent for students who wish to
sell text books, opening at the
beginning of each quarter for three
or four days. Save for the time last
spring when a student, displeased
with the system, sued the Book
Exchange for $4.20, this activity
has been increasingly successful.
When Dr. Ralph Bunche presided
at a model assembly of the United
Nations on campus in the spring of
1951, A Phi O members helped out.
They will also assist the lIR at this
week's conference. The chapter reg
ularly runs a "rides box" to get
rides home and back for students at
vacations. In 1950, A Phi O stood
by to '"guard" Hoover Tower Sun
day afternoons, when it was proposed
that the Tower be opened to the
public at that time.
The chapter's most recent project
has been a rides box in co-opera
tion with the Ski Club, to arrange
rides to ski areas during the season.
This box is located on the Ski Club
bulletin board near the ASSU of
fice. Additional Daily boxes were
also recently built and installed by
A Phi O.
Only prerequisites for membership
in A Phi O are previous Boy Scout
membership and an active interest
in giving service.
