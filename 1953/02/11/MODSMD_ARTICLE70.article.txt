NEW YORK, Feb. 10 (UP)â€”For
mer Russian Prime Minister Alex
ander Kerensky said today the cur
rent Jewish purge in Russia is
aimed primarily at weakening na
tions such as Germany and the
Moslem countries by kindling anti-
Semitism in them.
He discounted the theory that the
Jewish purge may reflect a power
fight in the Politburo.
"The movement against the
Jews," he said, "strengthens Com
munism, they think, in the Moslem
world, and reanimates the latent
anti - Jewish feelings in different
countries, such as Germany.
'"They think it probably helps in
the disintegration of the capitalist
world."
