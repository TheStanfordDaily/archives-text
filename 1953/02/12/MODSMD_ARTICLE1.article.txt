## Rosenbergs Face Death Sentences 
### 
OSSINING, N.Y., Feb. 11 (UP)—Atom spies Julius and ti'hel
Rosenberg learned President Eisenhower had refused to save
them today from a radio announcer's voice booming over a loud
speaker in the death row of Sing Sing Prison.
Mrs. Rosenberg, the only occupant of the death house women's

wing, sat alone in her cell as the
bulletin was read at 5:20 p.m., War
den Wilfred L. Denno said. Her
husband was in the men's section of
death row.
They were listening to a regular
radio broadcast, which was inter
rupted for the reading of the l»nl-
Ictin that probably doomed them.
Denno said the Rosenbergs had
nothing to say about the decision
and went on listening quietly to
the program when it was re
sumed.
Only last-minute intervention by
the Supreme Court now can pre
vent the New York couple, the par
ents of two young children, from
becoming the first Americans to die
in peacetime for espionage. The
court twice has refused to inter
vene and is not expected to change
its stand.
Mr. Eisenhower called their act
in passing atomic secrets to Rus
sia a "betrayal" of the men fighting
in Korea and a crime worse than
murder. He said a "careful exami
nation" convinccd him they "have
been accorded their full measure of
justicc."
Federal Judge Irving R. Kaufman
of New York is scheduled to set a
new execution date on Feb. 16.
