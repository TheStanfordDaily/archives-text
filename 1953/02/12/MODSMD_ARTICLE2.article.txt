# Ike's Korea Plans
## 
### 
WASHINGTONâ€”The Eisenhower
administration is considering asking
United Nations members to increase
their forces in Korea and to cut off
all trade with Communist China, it
was learned today.
Informed sourccs said the propo
sals now under study include:
1. A call to non-Communist U.N.
members to bolster the Korean
front, with increased manpower,
equipment, and supplies.
2. A plan to cut off all trade by
U.N. nations with Communist
China.
The Truman administration had
little success with similar propo
sals and it remained to be seen
whether other U.N. allies would be
any more receptive now.
The U.S. delegation to the U.N. is
expected to bring them up early in
the General Assembly meeting
starting Feb. 24 at New York City.
