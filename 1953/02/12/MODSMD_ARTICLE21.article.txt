## Vishinsky Viands Israeli Minister 'Get Out' Note 
### 
MOSCOW, Fhursday, Feb. 12 (UP) —The Soviet Union early
today broke off diplomatic relations with Israel and demanded
the immediate withdrawal of the Israeli legation from Moscow.
Foreign Minister Andrei Vishinsky summoned the Israeli min
ister to the foreign office at 1 a.m. to hand hijn the Soviet note

announcing the government's deci
sion to end relations with Israel and
demanding the withdrawal of the
Israeli legation from Moscow with
out delay.
The rupture in relations followed
the bombing early this week of the
Soviet legation in Tel Aviv.
The Soviet note did not indicate
when the Soviet minister would
leave Tel Aviv. Except for tl:«*
"without delay" phrase, no time
was set for the departure of the
Israeli minister and it was be
lieved that a reasonable time
would be given for arrangements
to be made.
A Tel Aviv dispatch, broadcast by
Radio Moscow, said the bombing
was preceded by an active anti-So
viet campaign by the Israeli gov
ernment and the press.
Government officials "openly
incited" the people "to hostile ac
tivities" against Soviet citzens, the
agency said.
It labeled as a "vile crime" the
blast Monday night. The wife of
the Soviet minister and two mem
bers of the legation were injured
and the legation seriously damaged
in the explosion.
(In Tel Aviv early today, black
masked youths distributed notices
claiming responsibility for the
bombing. The organization, calling
itself "Young Hebrews," said the at
tack was in retaliation against what
they called an anti-Semitic cam
paign now sweeping Russia and
other Communist nations.)
The Soviet note had said that not
only press articles "of the ruling
parties in Israel but also the
speeches in parliament of the rep
resentatives of these parties, mem
bers of the government of Israel,
bear provocational character."
