# Registration Can Pay Off

Now that the March 1 deadline for filing win
ter quarter petitions for graduation has been
announced and now that the Class of '53 has
only another quarter and one-half at this Uni
versity, it's time to talk about jobs—and the
Placement Service has a valuable recommenda
tion on this score.
The office advises that senior men and wo
men register with them before graduation, re
gardless of their plans for the next years.
Eugene Dils, director of the Placement Serv
ice, offers some good reasons for this action:
1. Most college grads change jobs several
times during their lives. By registering with
the Placement Service the student assembles
all of the vocationally significant data about
himself at a time when professors and admini
strators remember him best and are more able
to give personal letters of recommendation.
These letters and the information required of
registrants are kept on file by the office and
used in future position-seeking circumstances.
2. Registering is especially important to men
who are going into the service after graduation.
A serviceman's employment file will be put on
an inactive status until his discharge.
Every week the Dean of Men's office re
ceives from 40 to 50 letters from employers re

guesting information about students who were
once enrolled here. Sometimes Mr. Balch can
give them information, sometimes not.
The employer wants to know more about the
student than just the information which his
transcript reveals —he wants to know the stu
dent's personal attitudes, his extra-curricular
activities — information that can only be an
swered adeguately by the student himself.
Although registration at the Placement Serv
ice is not as high as last year, at least eight
seniors and grad students are registering each
day. The startling thing, according to Dils, is
that in the last two weeks about 12 of the regis
trants have been men who are being dis
charged from the service.
"Two years from now the dribbling out of
the army will become a problem," Dils says.
"These men will be looking for jobs and if they
have the preliminary information filed the pro
cedure will be easier."
Spring is the season when the Placement
Service is booked up with employers seeking
fresh blood for their organizations. Many job
oportunities are available.

Every week the Dean of Men's office re
ceives from 40 to 50 letters from employers re

guesting information about students who were
once enrolled here. Sometimes Mr. Balch can
give them information, sometimes not.
The employer wants to know more about the
student than just the information which his
transcript reveals —he wants to know the stu
dent's personal attitudes, his extra-curricular
activities — information that can only be an
swered adeguately by the student himself.
Although registration at the Placement Serv
ice is not as high as last year, at least eight
seniors and grad students are registering each
day. The startling thing, according to Dils, is
that in the last two weeks about 12 of the regis
trants have been men who are being dis
charged from the service.
"Two years from now the dribbling out of
the army will become a problem," Dils says.
"These men will be looking for jobs and if they
have the preliminary information filed the pro
cedure will be easier."
Spring is the season when the Placement
Service is booked up with employers seeking
fresh blood for their organizations. Many job
oportunities are available.

Now that the March 1 deadline for filing win
ter quarter petitions for graduation has been
announced and now that the Class of '53 has
only another quarter and one-half at this Uni
versity, it's time to talk about jobs—and the
Placement Service has a valuable recommenda
tion on this score.
The office advises that senior men and wo
men register with them before graduation, re
gardless of their plans for the next years.
Eugene Dils, director of the Placement Serv
ice, offers some good reasons for this action:
1. Most college grads change jobs several
times during their lives. By registering with
the Placement Service the student assembles
all of the vocationally significant data about
himself at a time when professors and admini
strators remember him best and are more able
to give personal letters of recommendation.
These letters and the information required of
registrants are kept on file by the office and
used in future position-seeking circumstances.
2. Registering is especially important to men
who are going into the service after graduation.
A serviceman's employment file will be put on
an inactive status until his discharge.
