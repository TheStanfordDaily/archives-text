Reason, Not Emotion
To the Editor:
Having read Mr. Hall's viewpoint on the Wa-Meru
situation, I have full sympathy with his point that
an extenuated British supervision is necessary for the
Wa-Merus' advancement, but I have only a humorous
chuckle for his reasons supporting this viewpoint.
The danger in berating English colonial policies in
Tanganyika comes not from Miss Tuerk's second-hand
criticisms, but rather from Mr. Hall himself and his
misleading defenses of the recent British action.
Mr. Hall states that "the Wa-Merus are a back
ward tribe using outdated agricultural methods."
This is true. But Mr. Hall continues "Their land can
only be developed by more modern means and often
this necessitates the removing of a village." Now
does Mr. Hall presume for any intelligent reader to
believe that removing of a village Is a "modern"
method of land reclamation? Suppose the California
Bureau of Agriculture informed the residents of
Mountain View that cabbages were to be planted on
the site the city now occupies. I don't think there
would be any sudden exodus of Mountain View resi
dents. eager to give up their homes for cabbages.
Mr. Hall states that the Wa-Merus were offered
compensation. He does not know why they did not
accept it. I can see no reason for their refusal
either. The Iroquois accepted $2(5 for Manhattan, and
that was a fair transaction.
Mr. Hall states that these are a "simple people"
intent on getting a living from their lands. This is
a true statement; every intelligent reader is asked to
sympathize with this statement; every intelligent
reader Is also asked to sympathize with the fact that
"they are easily led by the more educated of their
own people" (as is usually the case) " —often fire
brands who acquire a glimmering of democracy in
a Western Country and wish to apply it immediately
amongst their own people, regardless of the con
sequences." We must all agree that a gleam of
democracy is a dangerous thing.
Mr. Hall calls attention to the fact that the British
Colonial office is not an "ogre." Apparently, Mr. Hall
defines an "ogre" as one who accuses an agitator of
being a Communist. This refrain from accusation on
the part of the British Colonial Office is commendable.
Should any representative of the Colonial Office tell
one of these "simple people," bent on getting a living
from his land, that he is a Communist, the result would
be utter bewilderment for such a Wa-Meru.
As I have said before, the danger of giving wrong
impressions about the Wa-Meru situation, comes not
from an American basing an article on the complaints
of an active participant in the affair, who tends to
look at the matter emotionally, but rather from a
British subject, supposedly removed and having the
facts of the matter at his command, answering such
an article with a tirade of the same emotional basis.
No doubt the British have excellent reasons for
their actions. I am given to understand from reliable
sources that (1) Not a small village (as Mr. Hall would
give the impression), but some 70,000 people were
displaced. (2) They were displaced not because of
any vague reference to "modern means" of agricul
tural reclamation. They were moved because a dam
was to be built on the site of the village, on the only
site possible for a beneficient dam. and that this dam
would provide the now "backward people" with mod
ern irrigation facilities.
It is not "what" Mr. Hall says; it is "how" he says
it. If he would please give us the facts of the matter,
which I am sure he possesses, and in such a manner—
devoid of emotional appeal—that we are obliged to
look at the forest instead of the trees, he may well
clear up the semi-false impressions left by both Miss
Tuerk's article and his own.

Ready or Not Ready

To the Editor:
It is not my desire to engage in a forensic bout
with a man convinced in the "civilizing mission" of
colonialism as Mr. Ron Hall seems to be. I just want
to make a few observations regarding colonial ad
ministration. I realize, of course, that I am running
the risk of being termed another "firebrand" with
a "glimmering of democracy . . as Mr. White put it
in the Tuesday issue of the Daily, but I happen to like
the glimmer as do many other Africans.
First there is this question of being ready for self
government. Mr. Hall finds Tanganyikans "unfit for
self-government" because Mr. Kirili Jahnet admitted
that his country needs and will continue to need some
help—presumably in form of technical "know-how"
since Tanganyika is rich in natural resources. Self
government does not mean self-sufficiency. If it did,
even Great Britain would not qualify for self gov
ernment at this time. Self government to many of us
Africans means assuming the responsibilities of mak
ing our national decisions as members, of the world
community. This does not exclude learning from
other nations. It simply rejects the somewhat im
modest practice of an alien nation making such
decisions for us and disposing of our countries' re
sources as it thinks best.
Personally I find it presumptuous for any nation,
consisting of as fallible human beings as ourselves, to
think it has the exclusive "calling" to lead any other
people "toward the greater realization of political re
sponsibility" as Mr. Hall claims his country is doing.
I believe one of the great qualities of a truly civilized
people is humility and keen realization of its share in
human imperfection.
But what about the large bulk of illiterate poeple
in Africa? someone is bound to ask. Is democratic
self government possible when the percentage of il
literate people is so high? Well, the colonial powers
ruling us have supposedly been at the job of edu
cating us since the latter half of the last century
when they put most of Africa under colonial ad
ministration. If, during all that time only about 10
to 20 percent have become literate (in the western
fashion), that alone is a sad reflection on these powers'
efforts or intentions, or both. Their policy has been
education for a few. exploitation for the many. We'll
correct that. And may I add that western education,
valuable as it is, is not necessarily a prerequisite for
intelligent living and intelligent politics.
Coming back to the case of the Wa-Meru of which
Mr. Hall seems to know little (and with which, I may
say, I am quite familiar), documented evidences show
that approximately 3,000 Wa-Meru were removed from
their legally owned land to a comparatively unhealthy
and less fertile area within the country. The expro
priated land was leased to a handful of European
settiers for "development." The British officials at
the U.N. did not deny these facts. They explained, in
stead, that the removal was a part of the overall de
velopment of the territory.
It seems to me that the best way to develop a
people's land is not to remove its legal owners and
lease it to outsiders. Rather it is to co-operate with
the people in their endeavour to increase their agri
cultural productivity and in the raising of capital to
purchase the necessary farm equipments. Incidentally,
who is more backward, the one who protects his prop
erty rights or the one who fails to respect those rights?

(Ed note: From a perusal of reader "name with
held's" letter and that of reader Kiano the editor
receives the impression that either they are talking
about two different cases or one has his farts wrong.
In either event, letters from Stanford students to
various official sources including the British Colo
nial Office and Dr. Ralph Runchc may throw more
light on the situation. The Daily will print the re
sults of these letters as soon as answers are re
ceived )
