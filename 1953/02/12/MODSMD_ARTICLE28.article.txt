# Pioneer Reburial Slated For Menlo Park Today
## 
### 
The remains of 24 California pioneers will be laid in their final
resting place at 11 a.m. today at Holy Cross Cemetery in Menlo
Park.
The remains were recently exhumed from what was once the
cemetery of St. Denis Church, now part of the Stanford campus.

Father Thomas McKeon, of the'
Church of the Nativity in Menlo
Park, will conduct burial services.
Although only 24 graves yield
ed traces of the dead, a total of
17-4 graves were found and un
covered. Of these, 58 appeared to
be the graves of children.
Permission for removal of the re
mains from St. Denis to Holy Cross
Cemetery was given by the Most
Rev. John J. Mitty, Catholic Arch
bishop of San Francisco, and by
Judge Edmund Scott of the Supe
rior Court of San Mateo County.
It was requested hy Stanford
because of the difficulty of main
taining the cemetery, located at
an inaccessible and isolated spot
on the campus. The site lies in
what the University eventually
plans to use as a residential area.
The St. Denis Church records,
held by Father McKeon, give evi
dence of 60 burials in the old ceme
tery.
Neither the church records nor
the exhumation disclosed evidence
of which was the grave of Dennis
Martin, who built the church a
century ago.
Martin, according to some histo
rians, came to California in 1844
with the Murphy-Stevens party in
the first wagon train to cross the
Sierras.
He is said to have heroically re
traced his track into the moun
tains the following year to rescue
Moses Schallenberger, who had
stayed behind to guard valuable
merchandise.
Martin settled on San Francis
quito Creek, south of the intersec
tion of Sand Hill and Walsh roads.
One of the most extensive lumber
men in the Woodside area, he built

a church near his home for the use
of his l'amily, employees, and the
scattered neighbors.
It was named St. Denis to honor
the founder.
A boundary decision by the
United States courts in 185fi de
prived Marrtin of his land. Sena
tor Stanford acquired the property
many years later.
When Martin died in San Fran
cisco in 1890, he was buried in the
little cemetery of St. Denis.
The disinterment was directed by
Carroll L. Blacker, Stanford super
intendent of buildings and grounds,
under Father McKeon's supervision.
