## Best in the U.S. 
### 
We would like to nominate Washington as the top basketball team
in the nation. We have seen them play many times and if there is a better
team in the country it is not a college ball club.
The Associated and United Press polls rank the Huskies only third, be
hind Seton Hall and Indiana, but these polls are little better than popu
larity contests with a Western team always at a disadvantage because of
the large block of votes controlled by Eastern sports writers.
One fact no one can quarrel wilh is the All-American quality of the
Huskies great center Bob "Hooks" Houbregs He has averaged 25..'J
points for 21 ball-games this year against top opposition (not ihe hicks
"Bevo" Francis plays against). The 0' 7" 225 pounder is deadly with
either hand on an almost impossible to stop hook shut. He has a shoot
ing percentage of 5(5 percent from the floor, which should quell any
cynics who think he might just be the product of a fast-talking publicity
department.
All Hail Hooks!
We saw Houbregs in the Northern Division opener this year against
Oregon at Eugene. The Huskies barely pulied it out of the fire in the last
few minutes 79-73. Iloubregs, who hit for 33 points, was about all that
kept the Huskies in the game through the second half. At one juncture he
his his hook shot from about 15 feet out on the right side of the key.
Oregon quickly hit for two to tie the game again, whereupon "Hooks"
duplicated his previous shot. This happened four times in a row. with
Oregon matching his baskets each time, and without Houbregs hooks,
Washington could well have never come close to the Webfoots that night.
It is typical of his irreplaceable value to the team.
In addition to Houbregs the Huskies have "Slippery" Joe Cipriano,
as slick a ball handler as we've ever seen, and speedy Charlie Koon, an
other hallhawk, holding down the guard spots. We have seen Cipriano get
hot with long set shots from the outside at a time when all seemed lost
for Washington, and turn defeat into victory. Ilis clever ball-handling
antics and aggressive defensive work have won admirers wherever the
Huskies play.
Doug McClary fj' 8" nnd team captain Mike McCutcheon round out a
first five that any coach in the country would consider a "once in a life
time" combination. This isn't all however, as (5' 7" Dean Parsons, and Will
Elliot, forward and guard, respectively, provide top reserves that Coach
"Tippy" Dye can call on in rmy situation and count on come-through per
formances.
Although last year's great Huskie aggregation flopped in the Coast
Conference play-offs against UCLA (with a great chance for national
honors—the finals of the NCAA were in Seattle), this year's club should
encounter no such stumbling Mock with the play-offs up north, and we
look for them to go ail the way. They now have a 10-0 record in the
Northern Division and are ju'.i • ix away from a perfect slate, something
that has never been achieved in League history.
National (Jiamps—l9ss
More doom is in store for the Southern Division if a tremendous re
building program at Oregon Stat materializes. The Beavers picked up in
tin ; year's freshman crop 7' 2" Wade Halbrook, from Portland's Lincoln
High School. He averaged 40 points a game in the '52 Oregon State High
School Tourney as Lincoln tool: the State Championship. In addition to
Haltrook the Beavers also have sophomore Tony Vlastileca (Gray's Har
bor JC transfer), who although overshadowed by Houbregs this year, should
make the all ND team and will still have two years to team up with Hal
brook. A (j' 9" forward also stars for the Bsaver frosh.
Another Powerhouse
Watch for Seattle U paced by the best little man in the country,
Johnny O'Brien, to g' ( t the NCAA tournament bid given annually to the
top Independent on 0 e Coast. Seattle has lost only twice this year and
one of those was to th * AAU champs, the Peoria Caterpillars. Its either
Seattle or the winner c.' the CBA, but the Chieftons whipped the current
CBA leader San Franehco U. handily several weeks ago.
