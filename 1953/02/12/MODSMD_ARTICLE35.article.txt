"Defense against the USC offen
sive style" has been the keynote in
varsity cage practice this week as
the Indians prepare to tackle the
second round of PCC Southern Di
vision play.
The team will enplane down to
the Southland at 8:15 a.m. Friday
and will stay in the Knickerbocker
Hotel in Hollywood.
This week's practice session has
been marked by the return to ac
tion of Dave Epperson, six-six cen
ter. Epperson had been sidelined
with the fiu.
The Cards are riding a three
game winning streak, their longest
of the season.
