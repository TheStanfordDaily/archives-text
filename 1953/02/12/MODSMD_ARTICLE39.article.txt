# Diploma Not Enough-Davey TKO'd in 10th
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Feb. 11 (UP)â€”Welter
weight champion Kid Gavilan kept
his crown tonight by flooring south
paw Chuck Davey four times and
scoring a technical knockout over the
college-graduate challenger at the
start of the tenth round when Chuck
was unable to answer the bell.
Gavilan, making his fifth defense
of the 147-pound crown, floored the
game challenger from Lansing, Mich.,
once in the third round and three
times in the ninth. He also gashed
Chuck's right cheek badly in the
eighth session.
Trainer Issy Kline explained he
personally had refused to permit
Davey to come out for the 10th round
because Davey had been struck in
the adam's apple of the neck during
one of the exchanges in the ninth.
Davey. 20, had given Gavilan, 27,
a hard fight before his battering in
the ninth. However, Gavilan, a 3-1
favorite, was leading on the score
cards of all three ring officials at the
end of nine rounds.
