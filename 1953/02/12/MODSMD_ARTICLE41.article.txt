### DICK MALTZMAN 
Stanford's rugged bicep and bal
lance boys coasted to their third win
of the season tonight, 24-10 in an
impressive meet which .saw three
probable "season bests" by Bruce
Bailey, Ken James, and Jack Ogels
by.
Bailey, wrestling at 147, pinned
Bob Watt in as beautifully a per
formance as Bruce has put forth in
two seasons at Stanford.
Ken James, came up with easily
his best match of the season in the
rugged 157 division as he decis
ional Hill Schmidt, the Gators
blind sensation who took the "Best
Wrestler Award" at the recent Jr.
AAU Tourney in Oakland. In a
match that kept the storekeepers
pencils going, James took the final
decision 12-10—a powerful array
of points.
Jack Oglesby, team captain, showed
his best form as he came forth with
a great effort to decision Ray Nel
son. one of the Gators better men.

A 1 Colton. again outweighed by 15
pounds, came up with a neat first
period pin over Ira Call of S.F. State.
George Russell, hampered by a
cracked rib that might jusi be
serious, completely outdistanced
Bill liorfli iti points for a decision.
Russell, last year's PCI champ and
number one man to heat for the
crown this year if he is in shape
to wrestle, will get the word from
the X-ray experts tomorrow on
whether he will be able to continue
defending his unblemished record.
Stanford's two losses came at 130
and 177. In the former, Jim Hutch
inson of Stanford got pinned by Phil
Lyons, one of the top 130 men on the
coast, in the closing seconds of the J
second period.
At 177, Pat Madden, ahead all the
way in points, got pinned in the
second period in what can only be
described as a fluke. Madden acci
dentally rolled on his back and a
quick decision by the referee gave j
Mason Brown the match.
