## ON THE SLOPES 
### 
Three veteran schuss-boomers and
a host oi untried potential will try
to retain Stanford's nominal Pacific
Coast ski championship in a flock of
interesting multi-way meets this
year.
Husky, bronzed Dave Taylor, the
captain and mainstay of last year's
ski squad, has used up his eligibility
and is now coaching the team. Ac
cording to Taylor the outlook is
nothing but bright. "Last year we
were tops in the Pacific Coast Inter-
Collegiate Ski Union, and we should
be one of the top three contenders
again."
Besides Taylor, gone from the
wars of the glistening slopes is
Alex KoslofV, the Flying French
man. Kosloff, a beautiful form
skier, was going to be drafted out
of school and joined the air force
instead.
However, Captain Doug Collins,
Irv Thai berg, and Denny Tuffnnelli
form the nucleous of a strong squad.
Collins, a football-playing junior
from Pocatello, Idaho, won the Class
B slalom championships at Yosemite
last year and will be a real power
in the downhill and slalom events.

One of the brightest hopes is Irv
Thalberg, a junior from Santa
Monica, he skied in France last
winter where he took private les
sons from Emil Allais's brother.
Last summer he skied in Chile
(where it was winter) and took
seventh in the Nationals. This is
no mean feat, since many of the
world's top racers ski in Chile dur
ing the Northern Hemisphere sum
mer months.
His specialty is the slalom, and
he also ranks high in the downhill
event.
One of the top performers on the
laminated boards is Denny Tuffanelli,
a senior from the windy city of Chi
cago. He is the top man in the Nordic
events the cross-country and jump
ing.
Another schusser who shows real
promise is Mac Wirth, a husky blond
from Milwaukee. Wirth, who is par
ticularly strong in the slalom, trans
ferred from Dartmouth, where he
was on the frosh ski team last year.
He serves on the Squaw Valley ski
patrol during weekends.
Other contenders are freshmen
Dave Clark from Spokane; Jim
Howell, from Utah, Rufus Morgan,
a good cross-country man from
Balboa Island; Bob Armstrong, ex
football tackle from Palo Alto; and
Southlander Bob Volk.
Team tryouts will be held this
Friday and Saturday at Dodge Ridge
when Stanford skiers will compete
against several junior colleges. Col
lins and Taylor urge all interested
in trying out for the team to show up
at Dodge Ridge for the races.
