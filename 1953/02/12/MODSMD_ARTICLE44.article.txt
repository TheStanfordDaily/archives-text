# Win-Hungry Boxers Face Gators in Pavilion Tonight
## 
### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
If you would like to see some 60
odd minutes of constant and furious
action tonight, then the Pavilion at
8 o'clock if the place for you. At
this time and place, and for the
admission price of zero, you can see

the Stanford boxing team, hungry
for its first win of the season, trad
ing hooks and haymakers with San
Francisco State.
The Gators, although for the
most part inexperienced, do have
three good boxers in the persons
of John Fawcett, Dick Kelly, and
Jerry Harper. Bob Baldocchi,
Stanford's outstanding boxer, will
be taking on Harper in the light
heavyweight event. Bob, knock
out victor in his two bouts this
season, will be trying for his
eighth straight victory when he
% steps into the ring.
Gary Sievert, 132 pounds, who has
faced nothing but the toughest of
opposition this year, will be up
against Fawcett in what ought to be
the top bout of the evening.

Bill Wraith, 156 pounds, who is
fighting his first college match,
draws a very rugged assignment in
that he will be boxing State's Kelly,
supposedly their best man.
It will be very interesting to see
how heavyweight Norm Manoogian
fares, after winning his first fight
by a knockout and losing his second
in a similar manner.
For once, neither team is forfeit
ing a match, and there will be a
complete card on tap.
