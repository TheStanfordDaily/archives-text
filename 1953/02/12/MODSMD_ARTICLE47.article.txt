(Ed. note: This is the first of
two articles describing the his
tory, purposes, and functions of
the two organizations which will
benefit by next week's Charity
Drive. Tomorrow's article will
concern World University Serv
ice.)
The Red Cross is there.
It is there when a tornado
whips across the Florida penin
sula to leave a path of broken
cities and homeless people.
It is there when a volcano in
Italy showers fire and ash on
a frightened people who are un
prepared for disaster.
It is there when a bleeding sol
dier lies on a barren hill in Korea
and calls for someone to help.
The Red Cross, an international
organization whose workers to
day are more than 95 per cent
volunteers, is ready to act at any
spot in the world where war or
natural disaster creates suffering
and need.
The "need" it fulfills has grown
to tremendous proportions since the
time in 1859 when the idea of such
an organization was first conceived
by Henri Dunant.
Dunant, a young Swiss busi
nessman traveling through north
ern Italy in 185!), happened to be
on the scene of one of the most
savage battles of history — the
battle of Solferino. Appalled by
the neglect of thousands of
wounded and dying soldiers, he
recruited volunteers from nearby
towns to help relieve their suffer
ings. In the following years he
traveled through Europe urging
that voluntary national societies
be founded "which in time of war
would render aid to the wounded
without distinction of national
ity."

Since that time the Red Cross
has been joined by do/ens of oth
er nations, the United States join
ing after the example of the Civil
war.
And since that time the Ked
Cross has extended its realms of
aid from medical assistance to
fighting men in wartime to such
prog-rams as:
1. Aid to people hit by disasters —
floods, earthquakes, storms, epi
demics.
2. Comfort to servicemen with

such morale-building help as enter
tainment, counseling, Christ ma s
parties, and instruction.
3. Adjustment help to veterans,
with emphasis on handicapped vet
erans who need new occupational
skills.
4. Civilian programs in first aid,
safety instruction, swimming and
life - saving schools, and home
nursing.
5. Blood donor programs to sup
ply needed whole blood for

both civilian and military casual
ties.
To extend the whole idea of a
"voluntary" organization, the Red
Cross has built its staff with volun
teer workers and has consistently
sustained itself with funds donated
by the peoples of the various na
tions it serves. Through such drives
as those held at Stanford, the Red
Cross has been able to avoid sub
sidy by the government.
