# Assembly Candidate Davis Charges 'Politics Is Dirty'
## 
### HADLEY ROFF Daily Associate Editor 
Bob Davis, a 25-year-old Stanford graduate student in journalism,
has a quick wit, a flashing smile and a gripe.
His gripe:
"Politics is just as dirty as we've been told it is."
Davis, who is the son of Gordon Davis, campus policc chief,

said he has become convinced, of this
within the past month. For it was
one month ago that Davis announced
his candidacy for the Assembly scat
in the 28t,h District, which includes
Stanford, Palo Alto, and South into
the industrial district of San Jose.
"Politics is definitely dirty," he
said, and "it's up to the young men
of the country, those between 21 and
30, to clean it up."
lie's determined to do just that.
Interviewed by the Daily yester
day, Davis said, "I would represent
no special interest group. I would
be fair and impartial to all groups."
Running, and vigorously, on the
Republican ticket, Davis said his
chief intent is to broaden the base
of the Republican party.
He said lie would like to see the
GOP somewhat less "aristocratic"
and more "democratic." He said he
would like to sec "moderate labor
elements" introduced into party
councils.
lie said lie was thankful that his
father is an employee of the Uni
versity and not xubicct to the
interplay of politics. Otherwise, he
said, his father might lose his job.
One of the reasons for the Central
Committee's attitude, Davis said, is
his you Lb. He said one elder member
of the Central Committee told him
that politicians fear the young be
cause they arc unpredictable and
can't be easily controlled.
He said both parties talk about
pushing young men up the political
ranks but added that "youth is the
first thing they use against you when
you run for office."
Speaking of his policies, Davis
said he likes to call himself a "mod
erate Republican." He said he is a
member of none of the numerous
party factions in the state, but is
independent.
"I avoid party labels," he em
phasized.
