THE DEAN'S NO SUCKER But Dean Donald Winbigler seems to agree with AWS Chairman
Alice McKinny and Ann Franks that the Dean Mary Yost Scholarship sucker sale is a worthy
cause. The suckers are on sale today at the Main Libe, Engineering Corner, Post Office, and the
Cellar from 10 to 3. Proceeds from the sale are for the Dean Mary Yost Scholarship fund, a
scholarship which is awarded annualy to an outstanding woman scholar and campus leader.
