# We Applaud Self-Evaluation
## 
### 
Last week one of Stanford's student organiza
tions did something that wins our applause.
Activities Board, one of the many cogs of the
ASSII bureauracy, sat down at its regular meet
ing, came to the conclusion it wasn't accomp
lishing anything, and moved to dissolve itself.
Actualy, it's not guite as simple as that. At
(he same time the board moved that it be abol
ished, it also provided for the substitution by
a new group—a Social Co-ordinating Board.
Activities Board was the body which co-ordi
nated student social functions. Headed by
ASSU vice president Ellie Myers, its member
ship included the presidents ol large student
groups such as AWS, Cardinals, IFC, ICC, Vil
lage Council, and the four classes. Planning
the social calendar for each quarter was prob
ably its most important specific task.
The president of IFC, for example, did not
have the time—or the interest —to represent his
constituency faithfully at v/eekly sessions de
voted to discussion ol whether the last open
Saturday night on the spring quarter social cal

endar should be awarded to the Junior Prom or
the Sophomore Hop.
And this is just what happened. Student
groups were not well represented, the result
being that last minute calendar conflicts arose
and many clubs, squeezed out ol a chance to
hold an all-campus function, were unhappy.
Under the proposed SCB, campus groups will
be represented not by their presidents but by
social chairmen appointed by the presidents.
Supposedly they will be people interested in
the job and having time to do it.
Whether the revitalized social planning
board will be an actual improvement over the
old one, only time will tell. We're not in the
position to Judge the wisdom of the technical
changes.
But one thing we can judge is the spirit in
which the members of this board made a frank
and critical analysis of their achievements —
and what's more, carne up with some specific
ideas for jettisoning deadweight to increase
efficiency.
We applaud this spirit. —Sue Wheat
