# BULL SESSION
## Joe Was Failing to Care 
### PETE GROTHE 
1 walked into my room and spotted my roommates-
Joe lifting weights. Joe is not too hard to spot, be-W
cause he participates on Mr. Taylor's varsity loolbulljjn
team and weiglus over 200 pounds.
"Well, Joe,' 1 T flipped off, "Do you want to hear|fl
what I'm going to present to my reading public to
morrow in Bull Session."' M J
"Not particularly," said Joe, fighting off nausea. *

"Well," I said, pretending not -
to hear him, "I'm going to let 'em j
know about a pledge of one of the r
living groups on campus. It seems
that several of the brothers out
for a good laugh brought this guy
around and so impressed the other
brothers with his feats that they
voted him in. But quick. And ,
who do you think the guy is," I ;
queried Joe.
"Dunno."

"He happens to be president of the AKL house at
Cal. That's pretty rich, isn't it? I roared, slapping
my knee.

"No," allowed Joe, doing a curl with a 100 pound
bar.
"Then I'll tell them that a bio prof gave a talk
two nights ago to (lie Stanford Research group on
the singularly exciting title of "From California to
the Tasman Sea, Through the Late Pliocene and
Pleistocene ... A Study of Fish Migration."
Joe was failing to care.
"Then I'll write about the fraternity man who re
turned to his house late one night and saw a darkly
clad figure rumaging through some clothes in the
bushes. He thought it was a thief, called the cops,
later discovered that it was a brother whose clothes
had been dumped from his car to the side of the road.
"My biceps are 15 inches," mumbled Joe.
"Then I'll wind up with a deucedly clever item
ahout National Baby Week and National Noise
Abatement Week falling on the same week this year.
"That'll really have 'em rolling in the aisles, won't
it, Joe?"
"Hand me ! those 20 pound weights," said Joe, "I
want to see if I can build my biceps to lt> inches."
