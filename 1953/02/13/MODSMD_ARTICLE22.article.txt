# CAMPUS OPINION
## Appoint the Assistant Yell Leaders 
### 
To the Editor:
Zeke Wallace SHOULD be in a fighting mood over
the yell leader proposition. He is fighting for the
sensible way to choose yell leaders, and he is entirely
right for doing so.
The yell leaders are a team, and as a team they
should be able to work together and get along with
each other. They should have identical purposes for
getting up there on the platform, and they should
recognize and respect the head leader as THE top man.
By electing all the yell leaders, we'll end up with
five "prima donnas," all leading yells to a different
:,pt, all in different styles, and all with different, reasons
for being there. The head ye'l leader has no authority
over them, because they aren't responsible to him
for a thing.
As it is now, the elected head yell leader appoints
the four assistants. In this way, he is able to de
velop a congenial team that will actually nwe their
job to the man in the center.
The head yell leader may want to pick men that
have similar interests, or men that are all the same
height, or four who have the sanru yell-leading style
the important thing is that they must have something
in common so that they will get along together, work
together, and look good. How can the students
EIJiCT such a team? A team of yell leaders is a
personal thing and should be done on a personal basis.
This whole proposal has gone far in the wrong
direction already, so Zeke will need plenty of sup
port.
