# British: Al Home, Abroad

### 
To the Editor:
I have read carefully Mi?,' Tueik'. 1 , article about
Kirih Jji net. and Mr. Hall's comment on it, and they
both sounded very familiar to me.
Mr. Hall points to the fact that, ev >n from what the

natives' delegate said, it was evident that these people,
on behalf of whom the delegate is here, are not
capable of their independenc.
Mr. Hall failed to put it in other words which will
describe better the truth: this is the level—cultural,
educational, and economical—of the people after
heini* several decades under British Administration.
I shall add, after having spent my life under that
administration: this is how (he British will try to
keep them forever.
1 have no doubts in Mr. Hall's good intentions, but
it seems to be ;ibout time that he and other young
potential British leaders should, honestly and inde
pendently. try to find out how their own people treat
others in what is called "The British Empire."
The people in Britain, living under an admirable
democratic regime, fail to understand that what is
t?oiiig on in their colonies is exactly the opposite of
whal (hey would fltt for in their own home.
Can Mr. Hall imagine that his government would
remove ;i building in London (for a highway, lor
example) and only afterwards offer some compen
sation to the owner? Besides that, one should not
forget that, still living in the part of the world in
which materialism is not the only criteria, even "back
wards" tribe:; have their sentiments, tradition, and
a will of their own, which should not be sacrificed for
others' interests.
I hope (hal the light of the public will lie focused
on this country before the last weapon of unheard
people "terrorism," will l>e used.
Belonging to the family of nations who have re
cently, or are still struggling to provide themselves
with the most elementary human rights, 1 also hope
that the young British people and others will rec
ognize their criteria and will understand that the
image of Clod was ivi n to every human being and
not only to those who happen to be stronger.
