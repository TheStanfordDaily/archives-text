# Miss Richer Treasures Memories of Dining Hall

### CONNIE COMPERTS 
Royalty for lunch, the hectic
days of food rationing during
World War 11, and the food line
on V J Day are among the many
treasured memories of Miss
Christine Ricker, director of the
dining halls and of Stanford Un
ion.
Miss Ricker, who lias served at
Stanford for the past 30 years, re
members well when Queen Juliana
came to tlie campus for lunch at
Stanford Union.
"The president of the student
body came in to have me straighten
his tie before lunch," she recalls
with a smile. "He and the hashers
were certainly nervous."
During the war, the Stanford
food situation was indeed desper
ate. Speaking of those years, Miss
Rickev comments, "What with
food rationing and the difficulty
of getting labor, every meal
served represented a crisis met
and surmounted.
"On V-J Day," continued the
genial dining hall director, "all the
eating places in Palo Alto closed
down, and many hunyry people
traveled to Stanford for something
to eat. We fed them in the Union.
Everyone around pitched in and
helped, even a handy member of
the Board of Trustees. At the end
we were giving out tea and ham
burgers, but we served everyone."
When Mi.ss Ricker came to Stan
ford in 1922, the Union had just
been started. At that time it was a
commercial enterprise. Additions to
the eating places on campus were
Encina in 1923, Branner and Koble
in 192 C, Lagunita in 1934, and Stern
1n 1948. Cafeteria service in Encina
started during the war, when the
influx of troops necessitated that
style of service, li has been main
tained ever since.
"One of the examples of the
growth of cnting facilities at Stan
ford was the starting of the Snack
Bar in 194t>," .Miss Kicker said. "It
was designed to fill a temporary

heed (increased registration) hut
now we just couldn't live without
it."
Blasting one of the popular illu
sions about the eating habits of
Stanford women, Miss Ricker pro
fessed that they are by no means
light eaters. "They give the boys a
real run for their money," she com
mented slyly.

A shrewd observer of dieting
methods, Miss Hicker observed that
most girls start diets after return
ing from Christmas vacation. "How
ever, their morale seems to fall
when dessert is brownies a la ,
mode," she added smiling.
Noting changes in the food hab
its of Stanfi/rdites, Miss Ricker
observed that on the whole stu
dent tastes have not changed tre
mendously. However, a large
number of small changes have
taken place.
One of is the new attitude
toward vegetables. "Spinach is no
longer the butt of joke; that it was
in the 1920'5," she observed. "Your
generation has grown up."
"The coffee habit has .increased
tremendously after World War 11,
mostly due to the influence of the
Navy," Miss Ricker continued. "Nov/
the "coffee hour" is a recognized
Stanford tradition."
Miss Kicker, who lives in Palo
Alto with her sister, says that one
of her greatest pleasures is to
have the children of former hash
: ers come to visit her.
A two - month trip to South
America is Miss Ricker's immediate
plan. She leaves tomorrow, and her
travels will include■; visiting the
Chilean lakes, crossing the Andes,
and spending some time in Rio de
Janeiro and New Orleans.
