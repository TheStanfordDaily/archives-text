# TOMSIC, FLOWER DUEL
## Conference Play Resumes; USC Cagers Host Cards 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford's basketballers, absolutely swaggering with power
after three delicious wins in a row, go south to do something that
they are absolutely capable 0f... knocking off Southern Cal twice.
It's a certainty that Ron Tomsic, the jutjawed gunner who scored
39 points in last Saturday's Cow Palace game, will enter the select

"400" club." He has i?i)4 points
ready, and needs only six more to
join the select group of four players
who have scored 400 or more in one
season. Hank Luisetti mafic the club
three times, and Ed Tucker, Jim
Ramstcad, and George Yardley each
made it once.
Tomsic is only 72 points from Lui
setti's single-season record of 4R5.
The well-built soph has only to aver- ;
age 12 points a game to tic the rcc- I
ord.
The despised Trojans, paced by the I
great Kenny Flowers, will face a clif- j

ferent Indian agregation than they
did six weeks ago.
Coach Bob Burnett said yester
day, "After three wins in a row,
particularly that Bradley game, the
team has confidence in itself. The
boys aren't going to beat themselves
anymore like they've been doing this
season. They are more consistent
now and will have to be beaten."
"We've been practicing hard on
defense this week and have been
emphasizing board work.
The main difference between the
Stanford team which will meet. Troy
in the Pan Pacific Auditorium to
night and the one which met the
Trojans six weeks ago is the vast
improvement of Captain George Zan
inovich and Russ Lawlcr.
Zaninovich has been consistently
hitting in the double figures as of
late, and bis serappincss and
strength on the hack hoards will
play a big factor this weekend.
