# Boxers Tie S.F. State
## 
### 
Stanford's boxing team, sparked
by its two big men, Bob Baldocchi
and Norm Manoogian, came from
behind last night and fought San
Francisco State to a 4-4 deadlock.
Big Bob, who won his eighth
straight fight, did it in his usual
washion. He pummeled his oppo
nent, Jerry Harper, for two rounds
with body blows, and then was
awarded a TKO victory in the third
after delivering several stinging
rights to the head.
Manoogian, who seems to be
getting in the habit of either
flooring his opponent or getting
floored, took care of his opponent
in a minute and 3ft seconds of the
fivst round. A booming right to
the jaw did the trick.
In the 132-lb. class, John Fawcett
edged the Indians' Gary SieVert in
a very close battle. Stanford
bounced back, however, when Fred
Dittmer won a decision over Doug
Whitely. In the 147-lb. class the
Cards' Jack Owens and Elliot Ja
cobs drew.
