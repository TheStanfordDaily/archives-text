# Baseball Opens
## Moffett Starts Varsity Season 
### DON WEBSTER 
In a game scheduled just yesterday afternoon, the Stanford
baseball team opens its 1953 season tomorrow against Moffett
Field. Game time is 2 p.m., and there is no admission charge.
Coach Everett Dean's baseballers weren't originally supposed
to have a game until next Saturday, when they play the Palo Alto
I Oaks. But Dean said that after hav-*

ing been hard at practice for over
a month now, the Varsity is ready
for its first action of the year.
He didn't say lie had selected
the first-string yet, however. "In
fact," Dean said "there are still
several positions on the first team
which are still in doubt. Tomorrow
will he a sort of try-out game,
where a number of players will get
an opportunity to participate."
At the same time tomorrow after
| noon, the JV's will play their open
ing game against the San Jose All-
Stars. The diamond squad will *be
split for the two games, even though
many playing Junior Varsity to
morrow may be Varsity later.
Though, as Dean mentioned, a
number of players will see action
at each position. Dob Murphy is
; slated to start on the mound for
the Varsity. Big Jack Shepard will
be behind the plate to catch the In
| dian senior.
