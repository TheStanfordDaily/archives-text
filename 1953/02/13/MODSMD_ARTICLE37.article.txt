### WIN GRIFFITH 
(Ed. note: This is the second of
(wo articles describing the work
and purposes of (lie two organiza
tions which will benefit hy next
week's Winter Quarter Charity
Drive.)
What is Vvoriti University
Service?
That is the question which
Drives Committee hopes most
Stanford students will be asking
next week during the Winter
Quarter Charity Drive.
It is a question which the leaders
of WUS believe can be answered
only by explaining the specific tasks
which WUS is undertaking.
According to its statutes, WUS
"encourages and supports all efforts
on the part of students, professors,
and others to meet the basic needs
of the universities and their mem
bers and to make them true com
munities and real centers of na
tional and international life."
WUS seeks the achievement of its
goal:
1. Through the extension of
material aid by members of WUS
to their fellow members who are
in immediate need.
2. Through the mutual sharing
of knowledge and experience
gained in attempts to resolve basic
university needs.
3. Through the bringing togeth
er of students and teaching staffs
in order to establish a basis of
international understanding from
which a spirit of universal soli
darity can emerge.
Tfye "material aid" World Univer
sity Service organizes and distrib
utes is the basis of its program, and
it is designed not to support stu
dents of universities of member na
tions but to give them the chance
to "help themselves."
This "self-help aid" includes such
projects as the following being car
ried on this year:
A WUS hostel to replace the

tents being lived in by students
in Karachi, Pakistan.
A health sanitarium to combat
rising tuberculosis rates of stu
dents in universities in Japan.
Books and mimeographing ma
chaincs of students in Djokjakarta
and Rangoon.
Living assistance to refugee stu
dents in West Germany, France,
and Italy.
Such aid is channeled by World
University Service with the idea
that "the student of today is im
portant in determining the events
of tomorrow, for he will be the
leader of tomorrow."
It is that "tomorrow'' which is
emphasized in all WUS work and
activities. The workers of WUS as
sume that the students of some na
tions are in a position to help the
students of other nations. They be
lieve that such help will better en
able students of all countries to
strengthen mutual friendship and
equip themselves with the proper
skills and knowledge to -assume the
responsibility of a free world.
A free world is the ultimate goal
of the World University Service
program. The real battle today,
WUS leaders believe, is a battle of
minds, a battle which will be won
only by education, a free exchange
of ideas and the facilities to pro
vide that education and exchange.


TECHNICAL FACILITIES—Students in a welding class at the Technical Training Center in
Karachi use welding eguipment supplied by World University Service. The equipment is sup
plied as a part of a WUS program to bring to the people of under-developed countries a knowl
edge of basic skills and elementary techniques.

tional and international life."
WUS seeks the achievement of its
goal:
1. Through the extension of
material aid by members of WUS
to their fellow members who are
in immediate need.
2. Through the mutual sharing
of knowledge and experience
gained in attempts to resolve basic
university needs.
3. Through the bringing togeth
er of students and teaching staffs
in order to establish a basis of
international understanding from
which a spirit of universal soli
darity can emerge.
Tfye "material aid" World Univer
sity Service organizes and distrib
utes is the basis of its program, and
it is designed not to support stu
dents of universities of member na
tions but to give them the chance
to "help themselves."
This "self-help aid" includes such
projects as the following being car
ried on this year:
A WUS hostel to replace the

tents being lived in by students
in Karachi, Pakistan.
A health sanitarium to combat
rising tuberculosis rates of stu
dents in universities in Japan.
Books and mimeographing ma
chaincs of students in Djokjakarta
and Rangoon.
Living assistance to refugee stu
dents in West Germany, France,
and Italy.
Such aid is channeled by World
University Service with the idea
that "the student of today is im
portant in determining the events
of tomorrow, for he will be the
leader of tomorrow."
It is that "tomorrow'' which is
emphasized in all WUS work and
activities. The workers of WUS as
sume that the students of some na
tions are in a position to help the
students of other nations. They be
lieve that such help will better en
able students of all countries to
strengthen mutual friendship and
equip themselves with the proper
skills and knowledge to -assume the
responsibility of a free world.
A free world is the ultimate goal
of the World University Service
program. The real battle today,
WUS leaders believe, is a battle of
minds, a battle which will be won
only by education, a free exchange
of ideas and the facilities to pro
vide that education and exchange.


TECHNICAL FACILITIES—Students in a welding class at the Technical Training Center in
Karachi use welding eguipment supplied by World University Service. The equipment is sup

What is Vvoriti University

That is the question which
Drives Committee hopes most
Stanford students will be asking
next week during the Winter
Quarter Charity Drive.
It is a question which the leaders
of WUS believe can be answered
only by explaining the specific tasks
which WUS is undertaking.
According to its statutes, WUS
"encourages and supports all efforts
on the part of students, professors,
and others to meet the basic needs
of the universities and their mem
