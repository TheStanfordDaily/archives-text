# De Sabata Concert Is 'Superficialâ€™
## 
### RON ROSEN 
La Scala's dynamic Victor de
Sabata, making his first appear
ance at Stanford, conducted the
San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra last night in Memorial
Auditorium before a large,
cheering audience.
Although all of De Sabata's per
formances v/ere marked by a high
degree of technical clarity and bril
liance, he seldom penetrated be
near the surface of the music. Con
sequently, the compositions he per
formed were ail hard, brittle, and
unimaginative readings.
For such works as the "Rakoczy
March" by Berlioz, and the "Dance
of the Seven Veils" by Strauss, this
is the perfect approach. When it
came to the "Wanderer's Sturmlied"
by Strauss, however, the conduc
tor's lack of insight to the more
profound aspects of the music was
quite noticeable.
Opcn in g with Stravinsky's
''Song of the Nightingale," one
was aware of the conductor's
brilliant orchestral handling. One
was also aware of the impotency
of this music when it is divorced
from the stage.
It was quite unfortunate that the
stage in Memorial Auditorium
couldn't permit a different seating
arrangement for the chorus, be
cause, though good in passages in
which they were heard, the Stan
ford Chorus was drowned out by
the orchestra throughout most of
the "Wanderer's Sturmlied" by
Strauss. It is also a pity that the
art of conducting was allowed to
degenerate to a superficial show of
surface brilliancc and blatant show
manship.
