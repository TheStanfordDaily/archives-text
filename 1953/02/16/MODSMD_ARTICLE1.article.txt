# Tomsic Runs Wild as Cards, Troy Split
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 14 — A
darting, cat-like, jut-jawed gun
ner named Ron Tomsic tonight
became the best "little man" in
PCC basketball annals.
USC Athletic Director Will Hunter,
Coach Bobby Burnett, and every one
of the Southland basketball scribes
acclaimed Tomsic as such as he: (1)

tied Ed Sheldrake's Southern Divi
sion scoring record of 38 points; (2)
forged ahead of Cal's Bob McKeen
by 8 points in the Southern Division
1 scoring race; (3) came within 14
■ points of Hank Luisetti's one-year
scoring record of 465; and (4)
sparked the Indians in their most
soul-satisfying, Frank Merriwell win
in years.
A Stanford team which was behind
by 12 points in the middle of the

third quarter forged ahead with 50
seconds to go in the game on a 25-
footer by Tomsic and sadistically
crushed the Trojans' pennant hopes,
76 to 74. And Stanford finished the
game with four first-stringers fouled
out.
It was a terrific comeback. On
Friday night, the Cards were swept
out of the Pan Pacific Auditorium.
93 to 56, while compiling the low
est shooting percentage ever made

by organized human beings.
Tomsic connected on 53 percent of
his shots, scoi'ing on every conceiv
able type of move. What makes Tom
sic's record even more remarkable
is that he was being guarded by the
great Kenny Flowers most of the
evening. He dazzled Flower with
driving left-handed hooks, one
handed push shots from the key,
jump shots from the side, a dart to
the right followed by a change to the

left and a fading shot, and other
assorted goodies.
The Indians held a 16 to 15 advan
tage at the end of the first quarter,
then fell into dire difficulty in the
second quarter, and left at the half
on the short end of a 41 to 32 score.
The hated Trojans bloated the
score to 49 to 37, before Burnett's
underlings got hot. Tomsic, with
assistance from Russ Lawler, George
Zaninovieh, and Olie Suzdaleff. nar
rowed the gap to two points, 55 to
57 at the end of the third quarter.
The game, which saw the poorest
refereeing job of the year turned in
by Ken Fagans, found USC ahead,
66 to 03, with six minutes to go.
Suzdaleff got free for a lay-up, Tom
sic dittoed, sank a free shot, and then
scored on a driving left-handed hook
to yivc the Indians a 70 to 66 lead.
USC arrested the lead, 74 to 73,
on two free throws by soph sen
sation C'het Carr with 50 seconds
to go. Then Tomsk* took the ball,
raced down the court, and meshed
an aivltiitg 25-footer.
With 40 seconds to go, forward
Wayne Culberson intercepted a Troy
pass and was fouled. He missed his
first shot and made the second. 76
to 74.
Thirteen seconds remained as
Flower, the hoopster who has ice
water instead of blood, dribbled
down the court and tried a long push
shot. It missed its mark and Paul
Johnson recovered.
In his anxiety to get a pass away,
he threw out of bounds. Southern
Cal took it out and Carr tried a 30-
footer that hit off the backboard and
bounced on the rim and then off.
And the game was over.
It marked the first time that Stan
ford has whipped Troy in the Fan
Pacific since Hank Luist.tti was in
school. The Indians had a 39 per
cent shooting average as compared
to USC's 33.
In Friday's game, the Indians got
off their low of the year as ihev
couldn't hit the broad side of Coach
Forrest Twogood's head.
The only bright spots in the
fiasco were Tomsk's I!) points
which catapulted him into the ex
clusive 400 club and the outstand
ing backboard work of Don Carl
son. Lawler and Suzdaleff. All did
well tonight.
But, as we say, this was Tomsic's
And right now Stanford ad
herents dov/n here are thinking of
nominating him for President.

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 14 — A
darting, cat-like, jut-jawed gun
ner named Ron Tomsic tonight
became the best "little man" in
PCC basketball annals.
USC Athletic Director Will Hunter,
Coach Bobby Burnett, and every one
of the Southland basketball scribes
acclaimed Tomsic as such as he: (1)

tied Ed Sheldrake's Southern Divi
sion scoring record of 38 points; (2)
forged ahead of Cal's Bob McKeen
by 8 points in the Southern Division
1 scoring race; (3) came within 14
■ points of Hank Luisetti's one-year
scoring record of 465; and (4)
sparked the Indians in their most
soul-satisfying, Frank Merriwell win
in years.
A Stanford team which was behind
by 12 points in the middle of the

third quarter forged ahead with 50
seconds to go in the game on a 25-
footer by Tomsic and sadistically
crushed the Trojans' pennant hopes,
76 to 74. And Stanford finished the
game with four first-stringers fouled
out.
It was a terrific comeback. On
Friday night, the Cards were swept
out of the Pan Pacific Auditorium.
93 to 56, while compiling the low
est shooting percentage ever made

by organized human beings.
Tomsic connected on 53 percent of
his shots, scoi'ing on every conceiv
able type of move. What makes Tom
sic's record even more remarkable
is that he was being guarded by the
great Kenny Flowers most of the
evening. He dazzled Flower with
driving left-handed hooks, one
handed push shots from the key,
jump shots from the side, a dart to
the right followed by a change to the

left and a fading shot, and other
assorted goodies.
The Indians held a 16 to 15 advan
tage at the end of the first quarter,
then fell into dire difficulty in the
second quarter, and left at the half
on the short end of a 41 to 32 score.
The hated Trojans bloated the
score to 49 to 37, before Burnett's
underlings got hot. Tomsic, with
assistance from Russ Lawler, George
Zaninovieh, and Olie Suzdaleff. nar
rowed the gap to two points, 55 to
57 at the end of the third quarter.
The game, which saw the poorest
refereeing job of the year turned in
by Ken Fagans, found USC ahead,
66 to 03, with six minutes to go.
Suzdaleff got free for a lay-up, Tom
sic dittoed, sank a free shot, and then
scored on a driving left-handed hook
to yivc the Indians a 70 to 66 lead.
USC arrested the lead, 74 to 73,
on two free throws by soph sen
sation C'het Carr with 50 seconds
to go. Then Tomsk* took the ball,
raced down the court, and meshed
an aivltiitg 25-footer.
With 40 seconds to go, forward
Wayne Culberson intercepted a Troy
pass and was fouled. He missed his
first shot and made the second. 76
to 74.
Thirteen seconds remained as
Flower, the hoopster who has ice
water instead of blood, dribbled
down the court and tried a long push
shot. It missed its mark and Paul
Johnson recovered.
In his anxiety to get a pass away,
he threw out of bounds. Southern
Cal took it out and Carr tried a 30-
footer that hit off the backboard and
bounced on the rim and then off.
And the game was over.
It marked the first time that Stan
ford has whipped Troy in the Fan
Pacific since Hank Luist.tti was in
school. The Indians had a 39 per
cent shooting average as compared
to USC's 33.
In Friday's game, the Indians got
off their low of the year as ihev
couldn't hit the broad side of Coach
Forrest Twogood's head.
The only bright spots in the
fiasco were Tomsk's I!) points
which catapulted him into the ex
clusive 400 club and the outstand

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 14 — A
darting, cat-like, jut-jawed gun
ner named Ron Tomsic tonight
became the best "little man" in
PCC basketball annals.
USC Athletic Director Will Hunter,
Coach Bobby Burnett, and every one
of the Southland basketball scribes
acclaimed Tomsic as such as he: (1)

tied Ed Sheldrake's Southern Divi
sion scoring record of 38 points; (2)
forged ahead of Cal's Bob McKeen
by 8 points in the Southern Division
1 scoring race; (3) came within 14
■ points of Hank Luisetti's one-year
scoring record of 465; and (4)
sparked the Indians in their most
soul-satisfying, Frank Merriwell win
in years.
A Stanford team which was behind
by 12 points in the middle of the

third quarter forged ahead with 50
seconds to go in the game on a 25-
footer by Tomsic and sadistically
crushed the Trojans' pennant hopes,
76 to 74. And Stanford finished the
game with four first-stringers fouled
out.
It was a terrific comeback. On
Friday night, the Cards were swept
out of the Pan Pacific Auditorium.
93 to 56, while compiling the low
est shooting percentage ever made

by organized human beings.
Tomsic connected on 53 percent of
his shots, scoi'ing on every conceiv
able type of move. What makes Tom
sic's record even more remarkable
is that he was being guarded by the
great Kenny Flowers most of the
evening. He dazzled Flower with
driving left-handed hooks, one
handed push shots from the key,
jump shots from the side, a dart to
the right followed by a change to the

left and a fading shot, and other
assorted goodies.
The Indians held a 16 to 15 advan
tage at the end of the first quarter,
then fell into dire difficulty in the
second quarter, and left at the half
on the short end of a 41 to 32 score.
The hated Trojans bloated the
score to 49 to 37, before Burnett's
underlings got hot. Tomsic, with
assistance from Russ Lawler, George
Zaninovieh, and Olie Suzdaleff. nar
rowed the gap to two points, 55 to
57 at the end of the third quarter.
The game, which saw the poorest
refereeing job of the year turned in
by Ken Fagans, found USC ahead,
66 to 03, with six minutes to go.
Suzdaleff got free for a lay-up, Tom
sic dittoed, sank a free shot, and then
scored on a driving left-handed hook
to yivc the Indians a 70 to 66 lead.
USC arrested the lead, 74 to 73,
on two free throws by soph sen
sation C'het Carr with 50 seconds
to go. Then Tomsk* took the ball,
raced down the court, and meshed
an aivltiitg 25-footer.
