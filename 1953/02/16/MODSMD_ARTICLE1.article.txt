# Tomsic Runs Wild as Cards, Troy Split
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 14 — A
darting, cat-like, jut-jawed gun
ner named Ron Tomsic tonight
became the best "little man" in
PCC basketball annals.
USC Athletic Director Will Hunter,
Coach Bobby Burnett, and every one
of the Southland basketball scribes
acclaimed Tomsic as such as he: (1)

tied Ed Sheldrake's Southern Divi
sion scoring record of 38 points; (2)
forged ahead of Cal's Bob McKeen
by 8 points in the Southern Division
1 scoring race; (3) came within 14
■ points of Hank Luisetti's one-year
scoring record of 465; and (4)
sparked the Indians in their most
soul-satisfying, Frank Merriwell win
in years.
A Stanford team which was behind
by 12 points in the middle of the

third quarter forged ahead with 50
seconds to go in the game on a 25-
footer by Tomsic and sadistically
crushed the Trojans' pennant hopes,
76 to 74. And Stanford finished the
game with four first-stringers fouled
out.
It was a terrific comeback. On
Friday night, the Cards were swept
out of the Pan Pacific Auditorium.
93 to 56, while compiling the low
est shooting percentage ever made

by organized human beings.
Tomsic connected on 53 percent of
his shots, scoi'ing on every conceiv
able type of move. What makes Tom
sic's record even more remarkable
is that he was being guarded by the
great Kenny Flowers most of the
evening. He dazzled Flower with
driving left-handed hooks, one
handed push shots from the key,
jump shots from the side, a dart to
the right followed by a change to the

left and a fading shot, and other
assorted goodies.
The Indians held a 16 to 15 advan
tage at the end of the first quarter,
then fell into dire difficulty in the
second quarter, and left at the half
on the short end of a 41 to 32 score.
The hated Trojans bloated the
score to 49 to 37, before Burnett's
underlings got hot. Tomsic, with
