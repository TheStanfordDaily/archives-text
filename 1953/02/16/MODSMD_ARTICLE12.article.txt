# Student Workshop Tackles Campus Problems
## 
### 
Stanford's problems, at least
a good number of them, were
dissected with surgeon's skill
Saturday by the more than 100
student leaders who attended
the Y-Student Workshop. And
the campus leaders came up
with significant diagnosis and
suggestions for possible cure.
Though a magic drug whs lacking 1
for most of the problems, at least j
some course of action was noted.
Some of the key problems dis
cussed were student-faculty rela
tions, the functions of the Honor
Code and fundamental Stanford
committees, the Lower Division ad
vising system. And there were many
more.
To handle the multiplicity of topics,
the conference broke down into five |
discussion sections.
Student Body President Dick j
Weismann commented. "It was a I
real success."
He went on to say, "I fed lhal
much was done here to promote
interest in student affairs and lo
bring into focus certain campus |
problems."
The first section, led by Nancy
| Clark, discussed ways to stimulate
participation in campus affairs and
recommended that each group
clearly define its functions and
objectives.
The section specifically discussed
the Debate Society and suggested
that it reorganize its activities to
include more intra-mural debates.
The section also recommended that
| groups needing large membership,
| like the Daily and lIR, place more

emphasis on recruiting sophomores
and upperclassmen instead of fresh
men. It was pointed out that it takes
the average freshman about one year
to become accustomed to the college
study routine.
Section two, "Evaluating Your
Organization," headed by Dan Wil
hnr, spent a good portion of its
time discussing the Daily and its
relationship to the campus. It was
suggested lhat the Daily publish
feature stories on the activities on
the various campus organizations
1 o better acquaint students with
extracurricula activities. The group
complimented the Daily on its cov
erage of minor sports and on the
quality of its political editorials.
The group discussed the possibility
of establishing a music listening
room. Representatives of the Union
Planning Committee reported that
plans for such a room are being
drawn up by them.
This group also discussed the spon
soring system, anrl recommended that
Mel Butler, currently head sponsor,
investigate ways to better familiarize
sponsors with their duties before the
opening of school.
The third section, discussing
"Building a Cohesive Student
Body," led by Mel Bntlcr, weighed
the student-faculty relation prob
lem and came tip with several sug
gestions, the chief one being that
the students themselves assume
some responsibility in fostering
better relations.
Some of the students, particularly
i the freshmen representatives on the
section, said that part of the problem
| stems from the nature of the Lower
J Division advisor system. Some felt
I that the system was antiquated.

Butler pointed out that the ad
visors this year were briefed on their
duties only one hour before sched
uled meeting with the freshmen. It
was recommended that the faculty
schedule the orientation meeting for
advisors at least, one day before their
meeting with new advisees.
The group also suggested that each
department hold a tea at least once
a year and that more informal cof
fee hours be held at least once a
month.
The problem of integrating for
eign students into campus activities
was also discussed, and it. was felt
that living groups should make an
effort to try to entertain more of
these students.
The fourth section, "Discipline
and Authority in Student Govern
ment," with Tom Blount as chair
man. recommended that Cardinals
study the question whether stu
dents holding extracurricular jobs
should he paid. The group also
recommended that the Honor Code
and Fundamental Standard com
mittees he joined, thus eliminating
serious duplication of function.
Section five. "Traditions in Re
vew," chairmanned by Herb Dwitjht,
recommended that the period for
building the Big Game bonfire be
shortened and that the system for
guarding the campus during Big
Game week be discontinued. The
group further recommended that
the details of Olympic Day be more
| carefully planned.
Miss Adcle Strogen, assistant
counselor for women, was keynote
speaker at the morning session of
the workshop. She stressed the im
portance of the democratic aspects
of student body activities.
