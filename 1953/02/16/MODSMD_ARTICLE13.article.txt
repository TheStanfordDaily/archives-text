With the objective of raising funds for the Red Cross and World University Service, over 300
student solicitors will begin contacting on- and off-campus residences today for the Winter
Quarter Charity Drive.
The solicitors, volunteers from campus service groups, will work through Friday in an attempt
to contact every student enrolled in Stanford.
The Winter Drive Committee, headed by Chairman Don Lozabnick, is offering special "prizes"

to the residences with the highest
per capita contribution. The prizes
include:
1. Faculty hashers, who will per

2. The right to play a faculty br
ketball team in a game scheduled
for the week after the drive.
3. A painting by a Stanford art

already been contacted by mail and
the committee reports a "favorable
response of contributions."
All the money donated by the
faculty will be contributed to World
University Service for its "seli

tions will be split between the Red
Cross and World University Seiv
ice.
