# Science Fiction Is Chappie Topic

### 
Delving into the outermost
reaches of space and time in the
unknown worlds of tomorrow,
Chaparral, Stanford's humor (?)
magazine, will blast off into the
newsstands Wednesday.
Photos gathered by the Chap
pie's intrepid cameramen will re
veal the wonders of the universe,
while an inhuman monster, raised
from a hulk of protoplasm in Bio
2 lab, remains on the Farm to
send chills down the spines of
co-eds.
The issue will, as usual, sell for
the asinine price of 30 cents at
the Post Oflice, Cellar, and four
corners of Quad.
