With Excom passing a resolution last
Wednesday supporting the old traditions of
no smoking or bicycling on Inner Quad, we
would like to devote this morning's edit column
to the writing of a man who was universally
admired and respected when he was Dean of
Students at Stanford, Lawrence J. Kimpton.
Kimpton, who is now Chancellor of the Uni
versity of Chicago, seems to us to be more
able to capture on paper the precise mood of

the Stanford student than any other man before
or since his time.
He gave us this feeling upon first acquain
tance as a freshman, and upon rereading some
of his columns the feeling is still there.
The following—concerning Stanford tradi
tions in general—is reprinted from his monthly
column in the January 1950 issue of the Stan
ford Review.
