# IIR Conference Probes Foreign Policy Difficulties
## 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
The llR's Western College Conference on American Foreign
Policy is over, and the approximately 150 delegates have gone
back to their respective colleges and universities with a better
idea of the complexity of the problems facing the determiners of
our foreign policy.
According to Co-Director Mary Ann Kenney, the conference

achieved its aims.
"In the criticism sheets that the
delegates were asked to fill out,"
she said, "they expressed approval
of the various speeches, panels, and
symposiums. They especially liked
the foreign student panel, present
ing the viewpoint from abroad."
In Saturday's plenary session,
spokesmen from the various dis
cussion groups summed up their
groups' findings for the delegation
as a whole.
The main task for American
foreign policy in Western Europe,
(he spokesmen concluded, was to
aid in the formation of a strong
economic and military force
against Russian aggression.
In the Far East, the convention
was told that there is a distinct lack
of understanding between the
American and the Eastern mind.
The greatest question facing the
United States there is whether or
not the free world has a chance of
eventually winning Communist
China away from the USSR.
Economic effects on American
foreign policy were reviewed in
Discussion Scries 111. In this series,
speakers and delegates alike em
phasized the importance of "trade,
not aid." They expressed the belief
tthat if European nations are pro
hibited from trading with the Unit
ed States they will be forced into
trading with the Communist bloc.

They stressed that our econom
ic policy Is one of enlightened
self - interest, as witnessed by
ECA and Point Four, but unless
we provide a market for the goods
we arc encouraging Europe to
produce, our policy will prove a
contradiction.
The last of the discussion ses
sions dealt with political and social
aspects of American foregn policy.
Socially, America must, the dele
gates were told, advance projects in
sanitation, literacy classes, and
practical demonstrations of democ
racy at work.
The main conclusion drawn about
America's political situation is that
it is a highly dangerous one. Some
of the choices facing us are isola
tion, preventative war, peace by in
ternational settlement, or a balance
of power. Great patience is re
quired, as well as a readiness to
adjust our policy to the rapidly
changing circumstances of the
world of today.
