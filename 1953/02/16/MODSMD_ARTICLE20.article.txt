# A 						Chat With Dean Kimpton
## 
### 
A postwar period is always hard on traditions. The
veterans who flock in are older and more sophisti
cated. After going through the Battle of the Bulge
or the siege of Okinawa, the G.I. sees no particular
.sense in obedience to traditions just because they are

traditions. It is a sure sign of age
on my part, I am sure, when I
become nostalgic about the way
things used to be in the good old
days, but I do. Come to think of
it, a lot of worth-while traditions
remain, though many have van
ished.
Everybody smokes on the Inner
Quad now. There is no very good
reason, I suppose, why they
shouldn't, and the Corporation

Yard has lavishly decorated the Quad with appropri
ate gaboons. Mrs. Stanford's wishes on the matter
were closer to us in the old days than they can be
today.
For some reason, I used to enjoy the periodic phe
nomenon of a co-ed being cheered by the lounging
lawyers as she walked up the Law Steps. The girl
was always prettily flustered and the guffawing boys
enjoyed her confusion. Nobody ever hears of the
Law Steps any more. Now the lawyers smoke and
lounge in front of the classrooms and the Law
Library.
And I always liked the democratic spirit implied in
the freshmen wearing blue jeans. Viewed objectively,
the custom was probably Indefensible. The* Encina
crowd was always the shabbiest looking group in any
university in the world. And the jeans became un
believably dirty and became enhanced in value
thereby. But I liked it then, and I still like it in
retrospect. •
It somehow symbolized the fact that family money
and social position counted for nothing at Stanford.
Upon entering the University, everyone made a
fresh start, and he would stand or fall depending
not upon what he had hut upon what he was. More
over, the privilege of wearing cords as an uppcr
classinan was enough, all by itself, to justify the
struggle tlnough Lower Division.
I am disturbed by the fact that the old "hello" tra
dition has all but disappeared. It was a very friendly

thing to speak to everyone and be spoken to, and it
did a great deal to create that ineffable something
we call the Stanford Family.
I still say hello to all the students as I meet them
and from the startled looks by way of reply, I am
sure they feel (hat the old hoy is getting either a
little fresh or a little potty.
Perhaps with the younger group coming to us now
directly from the high schools, the pleasant custom
may be re-established. I sincerely hope so.
But a lot of the old customs remain. The Axe Yell
is still used and the Hymn is still sung, and both with
great feeling and verve. The frosh still build one of
the biggest bonfires ever each year, and they still
serenade Roble in the Pajamarino. Each professor is
still applauded at the end of every quarter, most
more and some less, and students always rise when
the President of the University is introduced.
More important than anything else, the Honor
Code probably has never stood higher in the esteem
and veneration of the students than it now does.
There is constant discussion among the students of
its great value, and the favorable difference between
Stanford and some other schools in this regard. I
have never heard a student, even a convicted vio
later of the Code, speak flippantly or disrespect
fully of it. Violators—and they are few and far
between—are still handled with dispatch and
severity by the student judicial committee.
There is another Stanford tradition that, so far as
I know, has never been fully defined, but which used
to be and still is. That is a tradition of what might be
called rugged and honest individualism. You don't
push Stanford men and women around and you don't
regiment them. They have a high respect for law
and order, and they want to do the right thing.
But in working with them, you explain the law;
you don't lay it down. Within the general rules of
the community everyone expects to be free, and
this traditional quality in Stanford people makes
the life of a Dean of Students pretty tough; it is
far easier for the administrative officer merely to
say, "This is the way it is," and make explanations
to nobody.
But I for one would not have it any other way than
it is and always has been with Stanford men and
women. In fact I'm that way myself; I guess I learned
it here a long time ago.
