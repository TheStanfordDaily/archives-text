### DICK MANSFIELD 
That child of fortune, Opportunity Knox, held that
Ihe best way to be ready and able to follow the whims
of fate wa.s to get enough sleep. Ten hours of every
twenty-four should be spent sleeping, said Knox to
a small group of admirers on one occasion, and when

a heckler asked where he could
find ten hours between 11 p.m.
and 7 a.m., Knox came back with
fiis now-famous retort: "Who
sleeps at night?"
Knox reserved the night for the
broadening things in college life—
■ uch iis social activity. He would
creep into the house at 4 a.m.
after a night of broadening his
education, and sleep until 7. He
never missed a class, either. And
he got his ten hours of sleep.

Knox had a list of the best places on campus to
sleep, and also kept notes on how to sleep in each
place. He had a definite technique, and he needed
one, for Knox did most of his sleeping in classrooms,
which takes skill. His notes were fortunately pre
served by Men's Council, which found them edifying,
and so have passed into our hands.
Best place for sleeping on campus, Knox found,
was Memorial Auditorium. It was very quiet in the
back of Mem Aud during a lecture, because the
amplifying system, except for its occasional fitful
wails, didn't carry sound that far. And it was cool
and dark. The main library was no good for sleep

ing—too noisy—and Frost Amphitheater had Girl
Scout Hoot Hunting and Bird Watching expeditions
that stormed up and down the paths and sometimes
trampled the unwary.
In a small classroom, Knox suggested practice of
the Glassy Stare method, involving sleeping with the
eyes open. Knox himself, tradition tells us. was so
adept that he actually, in his sleep, followed the
teacher's every movement with his eyes! This fasci
nated some teachers, unnerved others completely.
Committee meetings were a good place to sleep,
Knox found. The pleasant, low hum of voices and the
occasional shuffling of cards lulled him. Another good
spot he found, perhaps just before an evening social
event, was the Nitery. Here the custodian came
around just once a month to kick the bodies and see
if they writhed. Everyone sleeps at the Nitery, and
Knox was sociable.
Cuhberley Auditorium was out because the
acoustics were so poor that you could occasionally
hear the lecturer. Kncina Commons was good, the
hashers leaving sleepers strictly alone because a
rough with his face pressed against his tray might
iust be examining the residue of the last meal still
evident on the silverware.
So Knox had it figured. He never spent much time
sleeping at night. "Opportunity," said Knox, "comes
at strange times. You have to be ready. Never waste
useful time sleeping." Knox's roommate, Farley Gimp,
lasted two quarters at Stanford. Opportunity Knox
doubled this record before he, too, retired. But not
at night.
