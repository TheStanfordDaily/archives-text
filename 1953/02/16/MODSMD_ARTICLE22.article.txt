## Music, Not Conductor, at Fault 
### 
To the Editor:
I should like to disagree with the review of Victor
de Sabata's Thursday evening concert which Mr.
Rosen has seen fit to deplore as "superficial." It is
my own judgment, and that of most of those present
with whom I have talked, that the orchestra was
extraordinarily well conducted. De Sabata contrib
uted to the concert all the insight and technique one
could have possibly desired, and the result was a
series of almost flawless performances.
Tlie trouble with the concert inhered, not in the
conductor's abilities, but in the astonishing trash on
which he was obliged to expend his powers. One
hould quarrel not with the so-called "harsh, brittle
and unimaginative readings" of the works, but rather
with the choice of compositions whose musical style
is so commercial as that of Casella's "La Giara" or so
vulgar and crapulous as that of Strauss' youthful
folly, the "Wanderers Sturmlied." Certainly the error
of the choice cannot be attributed to de Sabata, since
he did not choose to perform those compositions, they
were chosen for him. Of the rest of the program, not
much more can be said, although the Stravinsky wns
urely the most interesting and intelligent of the five.
One can only register a certain astonishment at the
presumptuous innocence of such a statement as the
following concerning the Strauss: . . the con

ductor's lack of insight to the more profound aspects
of the music was quite noticeable." Had Mr. Rosen
spent a few months studying the score, he might then
be privileged to claim profundity as one of the miss
ing qualities of the performance given to the world;
but since we were all reading the work for the first
time, we would all do well to restrict ourselves to a
commentary on what was there, and not, like Mr.
Rosen, go hunting qualities of music and faults of
performance which were nowhere apparent.
