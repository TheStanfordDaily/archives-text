# Plans Proceed For New Union
## 
### 
The half-way mark on the ASSU
Union Planning Committee's survey
of student opinion on the proposed
Tresidder Union nears as speaking
teams again visit campus living
groups tonight.
Results of the committee's three
point program—discussion in the liv
ing groups, six thousand question
naires, and public hearings— will
establish trends to be followed in
construction of the activities center.
Discussion last week was termed
"satisfactory" by Joan Ilixson, sec
retary of the committee. Chris
Johnson, in charge of tabulation,
noted "a careful effort being made
by students to write in their sug
gestions and ideas on (he question
naires."
Thursday a joint meeting of the
Off-Campus Men and Women's Clubs
will be held on the subject of the
Union. On hand to discuss the
project will be members of the ASSU
Union Planning Committee. Barbara
Green, ofl-campus Excom Rep, and
Don Cathcart, from the Off-Campus
Men's Club are handling arrange
ments for the meeting.
Invitations are now being extended
to interested individuals to discuss
the project during the week of
March 3 to 7 prior to the writing of
the Committee's Report.
