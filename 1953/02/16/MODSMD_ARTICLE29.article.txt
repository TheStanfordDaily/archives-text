# Good and Bad of Nationalism Discussed in Sunday Sermon
## 
### 
In his sermon at Memorial Church yesterday morning on "Na
tional Vices and National Virtues," the Rev. Alexander Miller,
lecturer in religion, discussed "the Christian understanding oI
the nation, its place in the purpose of God."
According to Dr. Miller, the Christian has an "ambiguous" atti-

tude toward the nation: on the one*
hand he has a tendency to set it j
aside, it has been superseded by the j
international church of God; on the j
other he considers it n gift of God. j
The nation, said Dr. Miller, is
good since it can deliver man "from |
the circle of selfishness and ego
tism," but it is bad since, like all
man's communities, it is not free
from sin and there is an ever-pres
ent danger of idolatry, of making it
"a substitute for God."
As an "amiable alien" (from New
Zealand) and a "brother in Chris
tianity." Dr. Miller pointed out that
the nation "needs and deserves our
loyalty and the next-to best service
of our minds." However, part of
this loyalty is our criticism.

♦
He mentioned that Americans
i often think themselves generous
! to other countries, and are sur
prised when they do not receive
j enough thanks, or instead receive
blame.
The role of Christians is to real
ze that there can be no secure peace
in the world we know—"the price
of peace, like the price of freedom,
is eternal vigilance"; that "power
tends to corrupt," and that "the jus
tification for the United Nations is
democratic restraint on too-power
ful nations"; that every offense
(specifically .speaking about race
prejudice) in this nation is against
all the rest of the world.
