# THE
						DU PONT DIGEST
## JOB WITH A FUTURE Supervising Production 
### 
Varied experiences in a Du Pont chemical plant
fit young engineers for higher responsibility

As was pointed out in the last issue of
the Digest, Du Pont's many product
lines afford men interested in pro
duction supervision experience in a
wide variety of operations.
For a better idea of what the work
involves, let's consider a specific case
—the production of "Mycoban" so
dium and calcium propionates, in
hibitors used by bakeries to extend
the mold-free life of bread and other
baked goods.
Many of the problems encountered
in the manufacture of "Mycoban"
are similar to those arising in the
manufacture of any Du Pont chemi
cal. There is the same continuing
effort to improve quality, while cut-

ting costs through the better use of
equipment, instrument controls and
raw materials.
The supervisor works hand in hand
with the plant technical section to
ward these goals. He also keeps him
self informed on technological and
economic trends affecting production
and sales, finds explanations for out
of-line costs, and prepares plans and
estimates for increasing production.
Such work obviously calls for a
sound technical background. In ad
dition, however, considerable admin
istrative ability is needed. A super
visor must be able to supervise. His
duties include keeping people under
him informed about long-range

changes in company policy and as
suming responsibility for their safety
and morale.
The unusual problems encountered
in "Mycoban" production are largely
due to the seasonal nature of its sales.
Its greatest use is in the hot, humid
months, or from late spring to early
fall. For this reason:
1. Production and warehouse inven
tories of "Mycoban" must be care
fully balanced against sales forecasts.
The supervisor gathers necessary
background information for this op
eration.
2. Production needs, including man
power, equipment and materials,
must likewise be planned to meet
sales forecasts.
3. Maintenance, including a yearly
hydrostatic test of the plant, must
be scheduled with the plant main
tenance supervisor for the minimum
interference with peak-season pro
duction. Emergency maintenance
must be kept down by carefully
planned preventive maintenance.
As you can see, production super
visors have a broad field of activity
at Du Pont. The experience gained
in this job will prepare an ambitious
man for advancement to positions
of still higher responsibility.
