# Frosh Top SI, 59-56 Bellarmine; 14 & 15
## 
### RUSS WILKS 
The freshman basketball team weathered a big storm that'blew
over campus Friday afternoon when it defeated St. Ignatius 59-56,
and in the calm that followed on Saturday ran roughshod over
Bellarmine 75-42. The pair of weekend tussles extended the Pa
pooses' unbeaten streak to 15 games, with only four tilts re-

maining.
St. Ignatius, which figured to be
weaker than Bellarmine, came clos
er to upsetting the frosh than any
other opponent this year. The City
team went into the final minute
deadlocked with the frosh. A foul
shot by Jerry Gustafson gave Stan
lord a 57-5(5 lead and then when
Ignatius came up court for its last
offensive play Gunnar Christiansen
intercepted a pass, raced down
court, dropped in a lay-up shot,
and clinched the victory.
It wat a nip-and-tuck-type bat
tle all the way. The frosh grabbed
a 16-11 lead at the end of the first
period and held a 36-20 advantage
at half-time.
In the third quarter, however,
Rene Herrerias' high-school five
caught up and went ahead of the
Papooses 42-41. This comeback
spurt was paced by Jim Stephens'
sensational gunning from the out
side and by the aggressive play
of rough and tumble Kill Mallcn
under the basket.
In the final hectic ten minutes old
reliable George Selleck and Chris
tiansen teamed up to pull the game
out with the aid of good rebound
work on the part of Denny Borcn
and his tap in basket near the end
of the game.
For the frosh Selleck, with nine
field goals, and Christiansen led the
Indian scoring parade with 18 and
14 points respectively. Mallen held
game honors with 20 points and
Stephens hit for 14 points.
Bellarmine, which came to the
Farm with a 17 and 3 record, was
never in the game. The Pa
pooses took a 2-0 lead in the first

minute and were never headed.
They increased it to 32-21 at half
time. and scored 43 points in the
second half as Dick Clegg cleared
his bench.
The visiting Bells' Dick Venezia
displayed a bit of brilliance in the
first quarter when he hit on three
straight jump shots. Alter that he
was ineffective, getting only two
more field goals on many poor
shoots. He still managed to capture
the scoring laurels with 18 points.
Captain Hon Wagner led the
frosh with 13 points and was
trailed by Selleck and Hill Flan
ders who scored 11 apiece. The
first-quarter offensive and defen
sive play of Flanders was short
of sensational as the red-headed
frosh collected all his points in
that 10-minute segment and con
trolled both boards.
