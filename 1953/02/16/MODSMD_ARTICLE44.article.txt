# Divinity Student Plays Farm Carillon
## 
### R.G. MANSIELD R.G. MANSFIELD 
hours every Sunday in Hoover
Tower, practicing and playing
the largest of all musical in
struments. His instrument is the
carillon, and Burdick is, offi
cially, a carillonneur.

The Hoover Tower carillon which
Burdick plays has 35 tuned bells,
covering a range less than half that
of the piano. The highest tone of
the carillon is produced by a bell
which weighs 25 pounds, and the
lowest tone by a bell which weighs
more than half a ton.
Burdick plays the bells from a
cubicle on the thirteenth floor of
the tower, which contains the ca
rillon's clavier. This clavier is
somewhat like that of an organ,
having keys and pedals, but the
keys are widely spaced oak rods,
and the pedals are much larger than
those of an organ.
The clavier is connected to the
bells by a system of wires, so that
Burdick can control the volume of
his playing by the force with which
he strikes the oak rods.
Burdick studied the carillon
with Dr. Kay Wingate of Alfred
University, where there is also a
35-bell carillon. Thinking hack to
other carillons he has played,
Burdick calls the Hoover Tower
carillon "a very clean carillon."
The Hoover Tower bells are the
gift of the Belgian-American Edu
cation Foundation, given in honor
of Herbert Hoover and installed
while the building was under con
struction in 1941. Kamiel Lefevere,
carillonneur of the Riverside
Church in New York, supervised
installation.
Burdick, a student for the min
istry, graduated from Milton Col
lege in Milton, Wisconsin, his home
town, in 1950 with an A.B. in music
and a certificate in pipe organ. He
then attended the School of Theol
ogy of Alfred University in western
New York, where he studied with
Dr. Wingate. He currently lives in
Berkeley with his wife and attends
the Pacific School of Religion.
Burdick calls the carillon a tra
ditional folk - music instrument.
He often chooses Welsh airs for
his Sunday programs because
these are typically folk music. He
also tries to commemorate impor
tant holidays and events of each
week in his concerts.
"I've got a couple of old May Day
things I'm saving for the first week

in May," he says. He recently
played a special religious program
commemorating the fiftieth anniver
sary of Memorial Church.
The 1,350-pound Bourdon bell of
the carillon bears an inscription
which, translated, reads:
Because I Am Called Leopold the
Royal
for Peace Alone Do I Ring
Over the Waves of the Atlantic
UNA PRO PACE SONO.


AT THE CARILLON—Oscar Burdick plays the Hoover Tower carillon. The system of oak rods
is the clavier of the carillon, which is on the thirteenth floor of Hoover Tower. The bells are
mounted one floor above, and are connected to the clavier by wires.
