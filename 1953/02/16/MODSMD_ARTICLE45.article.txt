# Farm Subdivision Interests Firm
## 
### 
A local construction company
said this week they may be inter
ested in subdividing part of the
Stanford land lying west of the golf
course, when the University is
ready to release it for subdivision.
Harry Arnold, president of the
Peninsula Pacific Construction Com
pany, said Tuesday morning that
Stanford probably will not be ready
to release its land for two or three
years.
He said that his firm was gam
bling on being able to secure rights
to the property when it is released,
and asked the Menlo Park Sanitary
District to guarantee the firm the
right to sewer the property when
and if it is developed. The board
refused the guarantee.
