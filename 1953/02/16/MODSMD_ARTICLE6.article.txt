"ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL"—Jim Biggins' Buick sedan was in
a Palo Alto wrecker's yard yesterday after a Sunday morning
accident in which he "fell asleep at the wheel." Biggins' Buick
hit a car parked on Pine Avenue off Galvez Street, shoved the
car 42 feet, crashed through a fence and hedge, and came to a
stop near the intersection. Biggins was uninjured.
