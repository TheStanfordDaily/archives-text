## Jet Interception Over Japan Stirs New Armament Debate 
### 
TOKYO, Tuesday, Feb. 17 (UP) —American Thunderjet fighters
were fired upon by two Russian-built planes over Hokkaido yes
terday before the U.S. interceptors chased the "intruders" back
to Soviet-held territory, the Far East Air Force disclosed today.
The incident stirred new speculation on Japan's armament pro-

gram in the Japanese Diet today.
The Air Force announcement said
two American jets tangled in a 10-
minute air battle with two planes
identified as LA-ll's, Russian-type
fighters, which were intercepted "at
least three miles" inside Japanese
territory.
Most Japanese government and
opposition leaders took a lukewarm
attitude toward the incident, al
though Japan warned Russia Jan.
13 that U.S. planes would repel
flights over Japanese territory.
An exception was Mazaru No
mizo, secretary-general of the So
cialist party, who supported the
American attack. He said that Ja
pan cannot be called an independ
ent nation if her skies are open to
Russian invasion. Nomizo said he
thought the intrusions might be re
taliation for alleged Hights over
Manchuria by Allied planes.
It was the first known intrusion
over northern Japan since the Japa
nese warning and the iirst time Air
Force planes had fired on an in
truder.
