# Rosenbergs Set To Die March 9
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 16 —Federal
Judge Irving Kaufman today set the
week of March 9 for atom spies
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg to die
in the electric chair at Sing Sing
Prison.
Emanuel H. Bloch, attorney for
the condemned couple, planned to
continue his last-ditch fight to save
the Rosenbergs from death with
these three courses:
1. He will ask the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals tomorrow to grant
another stay of execution so he may
have time to appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court for a new trial.
2. If the Appeals Court denies a
further stay, Bloch could ask the
Supreme Court for a similar delay.
3. He could appeal again to Presi
dent Eisenhower to commute the
Rosenbergs' death sentence. But
Mr. Eisenhower already has refused
once.
The Rosenbergs clung to a belief
that President Eisenhower would
change his mind. They claimed their
conviction was a "fraud" and said
in a statement that this was proved
by "the deliberate concealment of
Pope Pius' sentiments" from Mr.
Eisenhower and former President
Truman.
