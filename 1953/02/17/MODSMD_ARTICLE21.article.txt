# Chappie Humor Turns to Science
## 
### 
Stanford's humor magazine, the
Chappie, appearing for sale tomor
row at all its Usual places, will con
tain stories by eminent nonscientists,
who hold entirely earthbound views
of the future, looking hazily ahead to
concoct the fantastic fantasies.
Such stories included in this next
issue will be "Morning Becomes
Electrons," a socio-scientific view
into the future by J. Westinghouse
Motheral, plus a new chapter in the
exciting life of that famous American
hero, Tom Swift, as he graples with
the scientific imponderables which
have impondered scientists for years.
There will be an art page by
Ambler which is a survey of five
years of startling scientific discov
eries and news. Included also in
this issue is a photo feature of the
most phabulously phantastic phiction
ever photographed.
