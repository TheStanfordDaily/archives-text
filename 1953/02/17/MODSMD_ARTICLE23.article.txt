# ASPA Argues Wilson Case

### TED GIESE 
A "renaissance" meeting oi
the Stanford chapter of the
American Society for Public Ad
ministration heard a debate last
night between Dr. Richard Ga
ble, Stanford professor of politi
cal science, and Louis Lund
borg, vice-president in the Bank
of America in San Francisco, on
the question "Charles E. Wil
son: Can a businessman be a
good public servant?"
Lundborg, speaking in the affir
mative, proposed that the aptitude
necessary to good business admin
istration can be transferred to any
kind of administrative post, wheth
er business or government.
He maintained that business
administration always involves
personal dealings with the human
beings who actually carry 011 pro
duction. In his opinion, business
men are really forced by business
considerations to take public in
terests into account, and then
self - interest is no greater than
that of the office-seeker.
Gable, speaking in the negative,
warned that it would be dangerous
to operate on the principle that the
welfare of the public is synonymous
with that of single groups, and
feared the "subconscious gravita
tion" of businessmen toward group
interests.
A disinterested attitude, he
stated, might mean that a busi
nessman is at times a "traitor"
to interests of business. "It is a
question," he said, "of whether
the businessman can perceive the
public interest." Administrative
ability, far from being restricted
to business, is a talent in which
the politician himself excels.
