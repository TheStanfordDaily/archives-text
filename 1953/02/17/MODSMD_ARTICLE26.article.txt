# This Is Big

### 
This is the Winter Quarter Charity Drive.
The fact that it's big has been said before and
will be said again. In a way, it is not very big
as big things go these days. No one is talking
in terms of paltry millions; in fact, no one is
even talking in terms of hundreds of thousands.
And yet the drive is big—tremendously big
when considered in relation to practically
every other ASSU function.
It is one of the few significant contributions
to society that we as students can make right
now.
To be sure, our education in the lecture
rooms, the athletic fields, and in student gov
ernment activities is preparing us for future
service.
But by digging down in our jeans we can sup
port two outstanding organizations which are
helping to maintain and improve the well-being
of mankind right now.
The American Society of the Red Cross is
an organization of long standing in our country.
Originally founded through the devoted efforts
of the great nurse Clara Barton, it has long been
performing valiant service in times of disaster,
helping the suffering.
It also is of primary importance as a service
organization to the armed forces, providing
blood lor transfusions, the little comforts like
cigarettes and candy, and also a contact be
tween the soldier and his family at home.
The Red Cross also helps relieve—through
the International Society—the suffering in
countries abroad.

Most recently the facilities of the Red Cross
were called into action to send aid to the coun
tries stricken by the North Sea Flood, the most
terrible flood disaster to strike the northern part
of Europe in 350 years. The damage caused
by this flood is incalculable, yet the Red Cross
is coming to aid.
World University Service, on the other hand,
is working 011 a more long-range program. Its
efforts to strengthen the world's university sys
tem will not pay off with dramatic results today
or tomorrow. But they are helping to provide
gradually a better citizenry in the world.
Two features stand out in both of these organ
izations that make them particularly worth
while.
One, they both have American groups within
international organizations. They both support
programs in which international co-operation
and friendship is stressed. No citizen in a
foreign country can look upon the work of
either of these groups as a phase of American
imperialism.
Two, both the Red Cross and World Univer
sity Service have as a part of their philosophy,
"helping those who need it, to help them
selves," by far the most profitable form of
philanthropy.
The editor feels very strongly that these
groups are worthy of support and is digging
down into his not very plentiful means for a
good solid buck for Don Lozabnick's Winter
Quarter Drives Committee. Why don't you?

groups are worthy of support and is digging
down into his not very plentiful means for a
good solid buck for Don Lozabnick's Winter
Quarter Drives Committee. Why don't you?
This is the Winter Quarter Charity Drive.
The fact that it's big has been said before and
will be said again. In a way, it is not very big
as big things go these days. No one is talking
in terms of paltry millions; in fact, no one is
even talking in terms of hundreds of thousands.
And yet the drive is big—tremendously big
when considered in relation to practically
every other ASSU function.
It is one of the few significant contributions
to society that we as students can make right
now.
To be sure, our education in the lecture
rooms, the athletic fields, and in student gov
ernment activities is preparing us for future
service.
But by digging down in our jeans we can sup
port two outstanding organizations which are
helping to maintain and improve the well-being
of mankind right now.
The American Society of the Red Cross is
an organization of long standing in our country.
Originally founded through the devoted efforts
of the great nurse Clara Barton, it has long been
performing valiant service in times of disaster,
helping the suffering.
It also is of primary importance as a service
organization to the armed forces, providing
blood lor transfusions, the little comforts like
cigarettes and candy, and also a contact be
tween the soldier and his family at home.
The Red Cross also helps relieve—through
the International Society—the suffering in
countries abroad.

Most recently the facilities of the Red Cross
were called into action to send aid to the coun
tries stricken by the North Sea Flood, the most
terrible flood disaster to strike the northern part
of Europe in 350 years. The damage caused
by this flood is incalculable, yet the Red Cross
is coming to aid.
World University Service, on the other hand,
is working 011 a more long-range program. Its
efforts to strengthen the world's university sys
tem will not pay off with dramatic results today
or tomorrow. But they are helping to provide
gradually a better citizenry in the world.
Two features stand out in both of these organ
izations that make them particularly worth
while.
One, they both have American groups within
international organizations. They both support
programs in which international co-operation
and friendship is stressed. No citizen in a
foreign country can look upon the work of
either of these groups as a phase of American
imperialism.
Two, both the Red Cross and World Univer
sity Service have as a part of their philosophy,
"helping those who need it, to help them
selves," by far the most profitable form of
philanthropy.
The editor feels very strongly that these
groups are worthy of support and is digging
down into his not very plentiful means for a
