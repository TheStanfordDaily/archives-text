# CAMPUS OPINION
## Let's Cease Fire for the Moment 
### 
To the Editor:
The argument over the case of the Wa-Meru's
could continue to lill your columns for an indefinite
period I am quite content to wait until we hear the
true fa."ts from the official sources to which you have
written. Neither of my protagonists, despite their
claims, seem to know much about this particular
problem. In fact, they disagree with each other.
My courageous and unknown opponent has an
amazing facility for jumping to illogical conclusions
from a rational presentation of the facts. Any person
with this gift is indeed an opponent to be feared,
ami I was horror-struck to read that he could actually
understand my point of view. I must have used
: ome peculiar reasoning for this to occur.
If. in the fervor of my emotional appeal to your
readers, I defined the "ogre" as a being that accuses
every agitator of having Communist tendencies, then
1 apologize.
1 also thank my phantom opponent for tolerating
my point of view, which is something I could not
• xpoct from Mr. Wa Kiano.
British colonial policy is not entirely altruistic, but
it i: much more so than the feelings of the white
settlers in Africa. Thus it has the dual function of
I lacating the whites and the blacks. As an example
cf this policy, it recently refused to give more power
to the white settlers in Kenya in order that they
might combat the Mau-Mau movement more effec
tively. for such an action would only have aggravated
the already bad race relations.
Would it be considered emotional fervor if I said
that Britain has done a great deal in assisting the
development of the African races, both economically
and politically, and that without the British contribu
tion Africa would be much more backward today.
With man being what he is, the British have rewarded
themselves for their efforts. Those efforts deserved
ome reward. Mr. Wa Kiano denies that we have
made any contribution toward "civilizing" the
African. He ignores the higher standard of living
brought by Western civilization. What would the
percentage of literates be if the European powers
had left the Africans to their own devices? Would
they have had any medical or educational institutions
whatsoever?
Mr. Wa Kiano and I have argued before on this
: übject and we cannot agree. Therefore. I suggest
we discontinue occupying "Campus Opinion" until we
hear further of the Wa-Meru incident.

To the Editor:
The argument over the case of the Wa-Meru's
could continue to lill your columns for an indefinite
period I am quite content to wait until we hear the
true fa."ts from the official sources to which you have
written. Neither of my protagonists, despite their
claims, seem to know much about this particular
problem. In fact, they disagree with each other.
My courageous and unknown opponent has an
amazing facility for jumping to illogical conclusions
from a rational presentation of the facts. Any person
with this gift is indeed an opponent to be feared,
ami I was horror-struck to read that he could actually
understand my point of view. I must have used
: ome peculiar reasoning for this to occur.
If. in the fervor of my emotional appeal to your
readers, I defined the "ogre" as a being that accuses
every agitator of having Communist tendencies, then
1 apologize.
1 also thank my phantom opponent for tolerating
my point of view, which is something I could not
• xpoct from Mr. Wa Kiano.
British colonial policy is not entirely altruistic, but
it i: much more so than the feelings of the white
settlers in Africa. Thus it has the dual function of
I lacating the whites and the blacks. As an example
cf this policy, it recently refused to give more power
to the white settlers in Kenya in order that they
might combat the Mau-Mau movement more effec
tively. for such an action would only have aggravated
the already bad race relations.
Would it be considered emotional fervor if I said
that Britain has done a great deal in assisting the
development of the African races, both economically
and politically, and that without the British contribu
tion Africa would be much more backward today.
With man being what he is, the British have rewarded
themselves for their efforts. Those efforts deserved
ome reward. Mr. Wa Kiano denies that we have
made any contribution toward "civilizing" the
African. He ignores the higher standard of living
brought by Western civilization. What would the
percentage of literates be if the European powers
had left the Africans to their own devices? Would
they have had any medical or educational institutions
whatsoever?
Mr. Wa Kiano and I have argued before on this
: übject and we cannot agree. Therefore. I suggest
we discontinue occupying "Campus Opinion" until we
hear further of the Wa-Meru incident.
