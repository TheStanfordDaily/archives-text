# A 						Graduate House

To the Editor:
The most significant letter to appear thk quarter

in The Daily was Poet Zimmer's "Lament for the
Homeless Grad Student."
In the excitement of planning a new Union, let
us not forget the long-range plan for a Graduate i
House. A center for graduate activity on the campus |
is badly needed. In addition, a Graduate House would
attract many more advanced students into Stanford's
"working class."
But primarily, there is a need for graduate level !
intellectual and social contact, to transcend the nar- j
row borders of departmental specialty. A Graduate
House would bring new life and activity to the i
campus, out irom the usual monastic seclusion of I
oil-campus garrets, distant attics, and from the end- 1
less dreary corridors of the Village.
