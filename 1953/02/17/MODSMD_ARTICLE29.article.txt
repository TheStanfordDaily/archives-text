To the Editor:
It somebody helps himself and helps others at the
same time is that pood or lj-nd? You may counter
that it all depends on why such aid is given. J will
admit the giver often looks after his own interests
first. But both sides are better off than if they had
refused to acknowledge that the other existed on
this earth.
The abolition of slavery in 1822. Lord Delamenj's
research in the breeding of sheep that could be raised
by the natives in the Kenya area, in the 1910's.
Swynnerton's campaign against the tsetse fly in the
1900's. The recent discovery by Doctors Curd and
Davey of Antryclde, a curative drug for trypanoso
miasis of animals. The withdrawal of the old "Indirect
Rule government. The introduction of local native
authorities who collect taxes and administer the tra
ditional law. The East Africa Ten-Year Plan, costing
people in England 543.000.000 under the Colonial De
velopment and Welfare Act of 1945. Those steps are
in the light direction.
Like it or no, the British are in East Africa. I will
not say that their 19th century reasons for going in
there would stand up in the 20th century. But I will
say that it is their Colonial Office which has the job
of governing that area as of today. Their experience
in that area puts them among the world's best au
thorities to take decisions on the growth of that
area. A way of making this a better world, for you,
for the. East Africans and for the British.
Come, Miss Tuerk, these stories about the wicked
British will start nasty little bugmen talking about
the wicked Foreign Aiders trying to help backward
Europeans and non-communist Far Easterners.
