# Baseball Outlook—Things Look Good
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Things look good this year.
Venerable, distinguished
Everett Dean won't admit it, but
behind the confines of the
sunken diamond romp myriads
of baseballers who hit with the
thundering authority of Stan
Musial, run with the mercurity
of a wing-footed deer, and throw
400 feet on a clothesline a la Joe
Dimaggio.
Back from last year's baseball wars
come seven starters, including "the
big three," Jack Sheparri, Chuck
Kssegian, arid Warren Goodrich. And
that's nothing but good when one
considers that Stanford was a strong
pennant contender until the very
last series last season, when they
lost out to USC.
Most insiders seem to think that
the Indians will be the champs come
the end of the season with Santa
Clara offering the closest competi
tion. Southern Cal, last year's pent
house occupants, has lost just about
everyone and UCLA also should
drop in class. Cal, nothing in the
California Inter-Collegiate Baseball

, Association last year, should be im
. proved.
Co-eaptains for this year's team are
catcher Shepard and left fielder Es
-1 segian, two well-muscled ball—
• thumpers who weren't expected back
this year. Shepard was as close as

your next breath to signing a fat pro
contract and Essegian was also con
sidering it.
Shep, the husky holler-man from
Fresno, hit .379 in his soph year to
take second in the league. Last sea
son, he averaged .339 in league play
and .360 for the whole season. He
drove out five homers last year,
three out of the Sunken Diamond,
which is one of the hardest ball parks
in America to hit a four-master
out of.
Essegian, the quiet, poker-faced
linebacker turn e d outfielder,
turned in a fantastic home run hit
ting exhibition last year. He
boomed into 10 balls that were
still growing muscles as they
vanished over the outfield fences.
This is more than any Stanford
ballplayer has bit in his whole
college career.
Eight of his free trippers were hit
out of the Sunken Diamond. Only
three others had previously found
their way out of the park in the
whole history of the Sunken Dia
mond. Essegian connected for a .3*lo
average in league play last season.
The final member of Coach Dean's
'Big Three" is Warren Goodrich,
split-second reactioned shortstop. As

a soph last year, he was fourth in the
CIBA in hitting with a .348. He hit
.360 for the season. Many argue that
he is even hpfter at short patching
than he is at hitting.
Leading the pack at first is Hal
Hcnnacy, a sharp fielder, but not
sensational at the stick. Tom Dan
durand, a junior college transfer,
has been shifted from the outfield
to back up Hennacy. He is reputed
a good batter.
A torrid battle is being waged
for the second base slot. Rich
Scramaglia. who started a lot of
games last year as a freshman, is
tussling it out with Rog Irvine, a
soph, who hit a homer and a triple
in practice games last week. Also
in strong contention is scooter Sid

Flail, a little gunner from last
year's frosh team.
Goodrich plays king of the moun- |
-ain at short, while Len Swart/ and j
lay Swarts swat it out at the hot
iorner. Sw; its has the inside track [
ver Swart?., a converted catcher, j
o whom he is in no way related.
Essegian has the left field pastures '
ewed up while Dick Cole, Jim Agar,
11 Talboy, Dick Workman, and
Terry Evans are waging a battle
"oyal for the other two positions. In
iders ""seem to think that Cole, a
regular last year, will win out in
renter, with the right field award
ioing to either Agar or Talboy.
Oean. however, insists that no one
las an advantage over anyone else.
The big losses from last year are
\rt Ahrahamson, Joe Chez, and Rog
Jsenbaugh, the latter two of whom
were winning pitchers. Bob Murphy,
the character of the team, looks like
the number one hurler this season.
He has a variety of stuff. All he
needs to perfect it is his control.
Phil Page, port - sided control
Ringer, will probably be the other

starter with footballer Mike Acker
and long-limbed soph Ken Frown
around as tnp-drawer relief pitchers.
Much is expected in the pitching
department from two men who are
now pitching baskets . . . Don
DeLong and six-foot-seven Riiss
Lawler. Two other highly touted
prospects are strike-out artist Ray
tfighsmith and control man C>il
Duncan.
Catcher Shepard is ably backed up
by husky Clarke Nelson.
Yes, things look good this year.

the Indians will be the champs come
the end of the season with Santa
Clara offering the closest competi
tion. Southern Cal, last year's pent
house occupants, has lost just about
everyone and UCLA also should
drop in class. Cal, nothing in the
California Inter-Collegiate Baseball

, Association last year, should be im
. proved.
Co-eaptains for this year's team are
catcher Shepard and left fielder Es
-1 segian, two well-muscled ball—
• thumpers who weren't expected back
this year. Shepard was as close as

your next breath to signing a fat pro
contract and Essegian was also con
sidering it.
Shep, the husky holler-man from
Fresno, hit .379 in his soph year to
take second in the league. Last sea
son, he averaged .339 in league play
and .360 for the whole season. He
drove out five homers last year,
three out of the Sunken Diamond,
which is one of the hardest ball parks
in America to hit a four-master
out of.
Essegian, the quiet, poker-faced
linebacker turn e d outfielder,
turned in a fantastic home run hit
ting exhibition last year. He
boomed into 10 balls that were
still growing muscles as they
vanished over the outfield fences.
This is more than any Stanford
ballplayer has bit in his whole
college career.
Eight of his free trippers were hit
out of the Sunken Diamond. Only
three others had previously found
their way out of the park in the
whole history of the Sunken Dia
mond. Essegian connected for a .3*lo
average in league play last season.
The final member of Coach Dean's
'Big Three" is Warren Goodrich,
split-second reactioned shortstop. As

a soph last year, he was fourth in the
CIBA in hitting with a .348. He hit
.360 for the season. Many argue that
he is even hpfter at short patching
than he is at hitting.
Leading the pack at first is Hal
Hcnnacy, a sharp fielder, but not
sensational at the stick. Tom Dan
durand, a junior college transfer,
has been shifted from the outfield
to back up Hennacy. He is reputed
a good batter.
A torrid battle is being waged
for the second base slot. Rich
Scramaglia. who started a lot of
games last year as a freshman, is
tussling it out with Rog Irvine, a
soph, who hit a homer and a triple
in practice games last week. Also
in strong contention is scooter Sid

Flail, a little gunner from last
year's frosh team.
Goodrich plays king of the moun- |
-ain at short, while Len Swart/ and j
lay Swarts swat it out at the hot
iorner. Sw; its has the inside track [
ver Swart?., a converted catcher, j
o whom he is in no way related.
Essegian has the left field pastures '
ewed up while Dick Cole, Jim Agar,
11 Talboy, Dick Workman, and
Terry Evans are waging a battle
"oyal for the other two positions. In
iders ""seem to think that Cole, a
regular last year, will win out in
renter, with the right field award
ioing to either Agar or Talboy.
Oean. however, insists that no one
las an advantage over anyone else.
The big losses from last year are
\rt Ahrahamson, Joe Chez, and Rog
Jsenbaugh, the latter two of whom
were winning pitchers. Bob Murphy,
the character of the team, looks like
the number one hurler this season.
He has a variety of stuff. All he
needs to perfect it is his control.
Phil Page, port - sided control
Ringer, will probably be the other

starter with footballer Mike Acker
and long-limbed soph Ken Frown
around as tnp-drawer relief pitchers.
Much is expected in the pitching
department from two men who are
now pitching baskets . . . Don
DeLong and six-foot-seven Riiss
Lawler. Two other highly touted
prospects are strike-out artist Ray
tfighsmith and control man C>il
Duncan.
Catcher Shepard is ably backed up
by husky Clarke Nelson.
Yes, things look good this year.

take second in the league. Last sea
son, he averaged .339 in league play
and .360 for the whole season. He
drove out five homers last year,
three out of the Sunken Diamond,
which is one of the hardest ball parks
in America to hit a four-master
out of.
Essegian, the quiet, poker-faced
linebacker turn e d outfielder,
turned in a fantastic home run hit
ting exhibition last year. He
boomed into 10 balls that were
still growing muscles as they
vanished over the outfield fences.
This is more than any Stanford
ballplayer has bit in his whole
college career.
Eight of his free trippers were hit
out of the Sunken Diamond. Only
three others had previously found
their way out of the park in the
whole history of the Sunken Dia
mond. Essegian connected for a .3*lo
average in league play last season.
The final member of Coach Dean's
'Big Three" is Warren Goodrich,
split-second reactioned shortstop. As

a soph last year, he was fourth in the
CIBA in hitting with a .348. He hit
.360 for the season. Many argue that
he is even hpfter at short patching
than he is at hitting.
Leading the pack at first is Hal
Hcnnacy, a sharp fielder, but not
sensational at the stick. Tom Dan
durand, a junior college transfer,
has been shifted from the outfield
to back up Hennacy. He is reputed
a good batter.
A torrid battle is being waged
for the second base slot. Rich
Scramaglia. who started a lot of
games last year as a freshman, is
tussling it out with Rog Irvine, a
soph, who hit a homer and a triple
in practice games last week. Also
in strong contention is scooter Sid

Flail, a little gunner from last
year's frosh team.
Goodrich plays king of the moun- |
-ain at short, while Len Swart/ and j
lay Swarts swat it out at the hot
iorner. Sw; its has the inside track [
ver Swart?., a converted catcher, j
o whom he is in no way related.
Essegian has the left field pastures '
ewed up while Dick Cole, Jim Agar,
11 Talboy, Dick Workman, and
Terry Evans are waging a battle
"oyal for the other two positions. In
iders ""seem to think that Cole, a
regular last year, will win out in
renter, with the right field award
ioing to either Agar or Talboy.
Oean. however, insists that no one
las an advantage over anyone else.
The big losses from last year are
\rt Ahrahamson, Joe Chez, and Rog
Jsenbaugh, the latter two of whom
were winning pitchers. Bob Murphy,
the character of the team, looks like
the number one hurler this season.
He has a variety of stuff. All he
needs to perfect it is his control.
Phil Page, port - sided control
Ringer, will probably be the other

starter with footballer Mike Acker
and long-limbed soph Ken Frown
around as tnp-drawer relief pitchers.
Much is expected in the pitching
department from two men who are
now pitching baskets . . . Don
DeLong and six-foot-seven Riiss
Lawler. Two other highly touted
prospects are strike-out artist Ray
tfighsmith and control man C>il
Duncan.
Catcher Shepard is ably backed up
by husky Clarke Nelson.
Yes, things look good this year.

Things look good this year.
Venerable, distinguished
Everett Dean won't admit it, but
behind the confines of the
sunken diamond romp myriads
of baseballers who hit with the
thundering authority of Stan
Musial, run with the mercurity
of a wing-footed deer, and throw
400 feet on a clothesline a la Joe
Dimaggio.
Back from last year's baseball wars
come seven starters, including "the
big three," Jack Sheparri, Chuck
Kssegian, arid Warren Goodrich. And
that's nothing but good when one
considers that Stanford was a strong
pennant contender until the very
last series last season, when they
lost out to USC.
Most insiders seem to think that
the Indians will be the champs come
the end of the season with Santa
Clara offering the closest competi
tion. Southern Cal, last year's pent
house occupants, has lost just about
everyone and UCLA also should
drop in class. Cal, nothing in the
California Inter-Collegiate Baseball

, Association last year, should be im
. proved.
Co-eaptains for this year's team are
catcher Shepard and left fielder Es
-1 segian, two well-muscled ball—
• thumpers who weren't expected back
this year. Shepard was as close as

your next breath to signing a fat pro
contract and Essegian was also con
sidering it.
