# PRO AND CAHN

If you think about it for a moment you can come up with some pretty
good reasons why a man might play football for other than the actual love
of the game. There's glory in football; there are benefits, monetary and
otherwise. And when school days are over, there are publicity jobs for
football names, there are coaching positions and there is the lure of the
professional gridiron.
But have you ever thought of what possesses a man to go out for tr'eW,
n sport which at Stanford is not even recognized as being a sport and
given no financial aid whatsoever?
We talked to a senior varsity oarsman and got an answer.
YoiTve Gol to Love It
To go out for crew you have to love it. That's what the basic appeal is.
Crew at Stanford is the purest of the pure and offers nothing more than
the worthwhile benefits of meeting men who are worth meeting, sharing
the work of the most complete team there is—a crew—and occasionally
winning, and with a win, feeling your chest fill with pride, because you
have done it on your own. That's where the spirit of the crow from.
And what about this doing it alone? It's history that the Stanford crew
has not received a dime from the athletic department. But by now they
are becoming accustomed to buying their own letters .and sweaters Ifvit
other athletes are awarded at no cost, and they are petting used to leav
ing school on a Thursday in private cars to race UCLA while other tenms
fly, and they are not at all surprised when a voluntary coach leaves end
another moves in. something which has happened five times in the past
four years.
But the one objection they have to the setup is that the athletic depart
ment won't tell the crew what they have to do to be recognized, what trials
they must reach to be accepted, or if acceptance is impossible regardless
of what the future may bring. The crew is told that the athletic depart
ment doesn't have the money and with that answer there is no argument
but if the athletic department would formulate a definite policy regard
ing once and for all, the crew would perhaps know where to turn.
Now they are in the dark. With no regular income there is no budget.
The crew has a fine schedule of trips ahead of them—Balboa, Washington
at Seattle, Syracuse, New York, UCLA and USC, both down south—but
they don't know whether they can make it or not. They will go if they
gel the generous donations which have carried them through in the past.
Liit tlicy fear a saturation point might he reached, and then where will
they he? Campus donations have been frowned upon as perhaps creat
ing a hit of ill-will as students are always being hit for one drive or
another.
So right now the crew auxiliary, a group of Stanford lassies who have
the crew's best interest at heart, is busy mailing letters to alumns and
friends. In between mailings they repair and paint the boathou.se and
do their best to keep the crew the representative unit that it is.
Orphan Crew Well Known
And in the past this crew, which trains the year 'round and at 5 o'clock
in the mornings during spring, has been called the Orphan Crew because
of their relation to other Stanford sports. But they kind of like the name
down deep, or at least feel that if they can't get a supported status they
might as well make the most out of what they have. So they have taken
the term Orphan Crew and have spread it across the country. Wherever
the Stanford crew goes they are known as the Orphan Crew from Stanford,
sometimes from just Palo Alto. Newspapers in the East give them full
page spreads. This is something different; this crew is a standout.
But what's the feeling after three years of crew? Was it worth while?
No doubt about it. crew men are quick to reply. They would do it again
in an instant. Otherwise they wouldn't be out there to begin with. Crew
is not a sport that recruits from high school as do other sports. Rather it
is an opportunity afforded fellows who come together because they want
to, not because pressure is placed upon them.
Of course there are regrets for not having time to fit all their studies
in or perhaps partake of some of the social and cultural outlets the uni
versity offers. But the complaint can't be severe for close tp sixty men
are working out each day for several hours in Palo Alto Yacht Harbor.
They are working out because they love crew, because they feel re
warded knowing that they are making something out of nothing and
because they take great pride in giving Stanford a representative crew
and doing it all by themselves.
