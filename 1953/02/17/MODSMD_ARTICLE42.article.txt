# Perry Contrasts Harvard Farm

### DAVE BROWNWOOD 
"Harvard has an atmosphere
of individualism, whereas Stan
ford seems to have a highly de
veloped collective spirit."
Professor of Humanities Ralph
Barton Perry, visiting lecturer from
Harvard, believes that this differ
ence between the two schools ac
counts for the entirely different types
of student organization and the dif
ferent attitudes concerning the
Honor Code.
"If the Honor Code works," as
serts Professor Perry, "it is good.
For such a system to function prop
erly, however, there must be a homo
geneity among the student body
which makes each member feel an
obligation to support the code.
"Stanford seems to have this
feeling. The group spirit creates
a 'group conscience' which makes
the individual feel that he must not
do anything that his group does not
accept as right, as well as making
him feel obligated to be sure others
uphold the group's principles."
Professor Perry, who went to
graduate school at Harvard and has
been a professor there much of the
time since, adds that Harvard has no
such group spirit.
"There is not such a thing as the
'Harvard man'," he says. "Among
the students there is great diversity,
with no pressure to conform. Prob
ably partially because of its urban
location, the campus is similar to the
city, where everyone is going his
own way.
"There the spirit is more 'live and
Let live.' The Honor Code would not
work at Harvard because the stu
dents would not want it. They have
a feeling of reluctance to interfere
in someone else's affairs, a necessity
in supporting the Honor Code, and
a feeling of resentment towards any
one that does not mind his own busi
ness."
The student government system
is an example of this "non-inter
ference" atmosphere. The function
of the student council is to find the

campus opinion and make sugges
tions regarding college policy.
There is no student control over
policy enforcement. Students pre
fer to let the administration en
force campus regulations.
The Harvard philosopher empha
sizes that an argument in favor of
an individualistic atmosphere is that
no one is pressured to conform to the
will of the group. Using an inci T
dent from his undergraduate days at
Princeton, the professor showed the
possible disadvantage of too strong
a school spirit.
"Princeton was extremely 'col
legiate'," he relates. "Each yean
spirit mounted before the big game
with Yale until everyone was ex
pected to believe that the Tigers
had no chance of losing, regardless
of the season's record. The day
before the game, however, a fellow
expressed doubt that we would
win. Although we lost by a rather
large score, some people would not
speak to him for months."
