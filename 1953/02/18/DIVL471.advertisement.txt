"Oxford" Man
Reveals Weakness of Opposite Sex!
MC':ttjik
Once upon a time, there was a wealthy young college man
who spent a million dollars a year on his wardrobe. Hut
the gals all thought he looked "square as an ice cube.
One day, while cruising around the campus in his solid gold
convertible with leopard-skin tires, he noticed a young fresh
man surrounded by a bevy ol beautiful dolls. Slamming his
foot down upon the sterling silver brake pedal, he smoothed
out the wrinkles in his custom-tailored suit and strolled over
to this popular fellow.
"Tell me," he asked, "to what do you owe your great
success with the fair sex. J "'
"Naturally," the young Casanova replied, "it's the shirts I
wear." He pointed to the pale gray Oxford button-down he
had on. "Everyone's bashing ears about Oxford shirts t his
year . . . and I have Oxfords in light blue, gray, yellow, pink,
lavender . . . and of course, white. Roll collars, button-downs
and those new short collars, too!"
The rich young man felt the luxurious Oxford fabric. ' Your
shirtmaker must charge a lot for shirts like these."'
"Shirtmaker nothing," grinned the young fellow. "1 get ;ill
my shirts from the friendly Van Hcuscn dealer right down
the street. And the ante is only 13.95 apiece!'
The wealthy young man made a bee-line for the \ an Hcusen
store. Since he was loaded (with money), he also bought a
dozen deluxe Van Heusen Oxfords, made ol high-count,
tightly-twisted yarn, for $4.50 apiece.

the gals all thought he looked "square as an ice cube.
One day, while cruising around the campus in his solid gold
convertible with leopard-skin tires, he noticed a young fresh
man surrounded by a bevy ol beautiful dolls. Slamming his
foot down upon the sterling silver brake pedal, he smoothed
out the wrinkles in his custom-tailored suit and strolled over
to this popular fellow.
"Tell me," he asked, "to what do you owe your great
success with the fair sex. J "'
"Naturally," the young Casanova replied, "it's the shirts I
wear." He pointed to the pale gray Oxford button-down he
had on. "Everyone's bashing ears about Oxford shirts t his
year . . . and I have Oxfords in light blue, gray, yellow, pink,
lavender . . . and of course, white. Roll collars, button-downs
and those new short collars, too!"
The rich young man felt the luxurious Oxford fabric. ' Your
shirtmaker must charge a lot for shirts like these."'
"Shirtmaker nothing," grinned the young fellow. "1 get ;ill
my shirts from the friendly Van Hcuscn dealer right down
the street. And the ante is only 13.95 apiece!'
The wealthy young man made a bee-line for the \ an Hcusen
store. Since he was loaded (with money), he also bought a
dozen deluxe Van Heusen Oxfords, made ol high-count,
tightly-twisted yarn, for $4.50 apiece.

"Oxford" Man
Reveals Weakness of Opposite Sex!

Once upon a time, there was a wealthy young college man
who spent a million dollars a year on his wardrobe. Hut
the gals all thought he looked "square as an ice cube.
One day, while cruising around the campus in his solid gold
convertible with leopard-skin tires, he noticed a young fresh
man surrounded by a bevy ol beautiful dolls. Slamming his
foot down upon the sterling silver brake pedal, he smoothed
out the wrinkles in his custom-tailored suit and strolled over
to this popular fellow.
"Tell me," he asked, "to what do you owe your great
success with the fair sex. J "'
"Naturally," the young Casanova replied, "it's the shirts I

had on. "Everyone's bashing ears about Oxford shirts t his
