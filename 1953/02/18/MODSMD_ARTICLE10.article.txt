## Lozabnick Optimistic On Total Contribution 
### 
Stillman House, Casa Granada at Lagunita, and off-campus resi
dents are leading the campus in the highest average contribu
tions to the Winter Quarter Charity Drive.
In the first figures released by the Charity Drive Committee,
off-campus residents led all living groups with a per capita con-

tribution of $2.32. The average con
tributions for Stillman House and
Casa Granada are $2 and $1.95 re
spectively.
Student contributions which have
been tabulated by the committee
amount to $440. The average over
all per capita contribution is $1.32,
with contributions from most of the
women's residences being turned in.
faculty contributions to the
drive, which will aid the Red
i Cross and World University
] Service, have amounted to SI ,-
j 170.50. Members of the faculty
I and staff have returned their con
| triliutions to the committee by
mail.
Winter Drive Chairman Don Lo
zabnik has expressed optimism
about the possible total contribution
to the cjrive. "The response of
both the students and the faculty
thus far has been excellent. I'm
sure Stanford wilbbe proud of its
final contribution to the Red Cross
and World University Service."
Lozabnick and the chairmen of
solicitations have reminded all
solicitors to turn in each day's
donations from 4 to 6 in the "Y"
office of the Women's Clubhouse.
Prizes for the highest per capita
contribution from the residences
will include faculty hashers who
will work next Wednesday evening.
Dean Winbigler, one of the fac
ulty hashers, has said of his im
pending experience:
"I cannot expect to enjoy hashing
in a men's residence as much as I
did hashing at Roble last year.
However, it will probably be more
exciting as it involves greater risks.
Furthermore, I deeply admire the
bravery and splendid recklessness
of the house which is willing to risk
my services."
