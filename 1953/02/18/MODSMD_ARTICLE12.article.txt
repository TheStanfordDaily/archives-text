HERE'S TO HEALTH!—Raising their glasses high are the characters of "Put It All on Red," one
of the three one-acts to be presented tomorrow, Friday and Saturday. From left to right are
Ross Durfee, the novelist; Ron Fineberg, a somewhat unwelcome guest; Bert Berns, a publisher
with a health complex; and Helen Davies, the novelist's wife. Tickets to the one-acts are avail
able for 75 cents at the Memorial Hall box office. —Daily photo by Glenn Erickson
