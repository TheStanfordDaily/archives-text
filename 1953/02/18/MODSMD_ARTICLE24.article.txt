### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (UP) —President Eisenhower told his
first White House news conference today that he is opposed to
any tax cut now. that he is not presently considering a blockade
of Communist China, and that he is absoluately sure Russia has
the atom bomb.

The President indicated he will veto a tax cut bill if it reach

his desk before the budget is 1 . 1-
anced. He also said his adminis
tration is considering a substitute
for the excess profits tax on busi
ness which is scheduled to expire
June 30.
Eisenhower renewed his cam
paign pledge to seek stable farm
prices and said he does not intend
to ask Congress for standby wage
price controls when the present law
expires April 30.
He also rejected the idea of re
placing all U.S. soldiers in Korea
with South Koreans.
At his first news conference
since becoming President four
weeks ago, the President dis
cussed on his own initiative five
subjects — the A - bomb, taxes,
farm prices, price controls, and
secret agreements. Then he threw
the conference open to questions.
As was the case with Presidents
Roosevelt and Truman, Mr. Eisen
hower's news conference statements
cannot be quoted directly, but here
is a summary of his remarks on
various subjects:
Taxes—He is opposed to cutting
taxes before the budget is balanced.
He hinted broadly he will veto a
pending bill to cut individual in
come taxes about 10 per cent c.i
July 1. He said he had never prom
ised a tax cut although one is desir
able if it comes in its proper order.
A-Bomb—All the evidence at
his command leads him to agree
with Chairman Gordon Dean of
the Atomic Energy Commission
that it is absolutely true Russia
has the atomic bomb, and a sup
ply of them.
Blockade — The possibility of a
naval blockade or trade embargo
against Red China is under consid
eration in several government de
partments, but the proposals have
not reached him and he knows little
about them. At present he is net
considering recommending an em
bargo or blockade.
Farm prices—He inherited the
problem of declining farm priccs
from the Truman administration,
but eliminating price controls wilt
help solve the situation. II?
pledged to abide by the present
farm price support law until it
expires December, 1954. Mean
while, the administration will
study plans for the best possible
substitute.
