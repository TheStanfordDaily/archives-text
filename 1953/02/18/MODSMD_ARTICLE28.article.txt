## Testmanship 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
Or the Art of Getting A"s Without Actually Cheating

(With apologies to Stephen Potter, author of
"Lifemanship," or "The Art of (letting Away With
I( Without Being an Absolute Plonk.")
I am speaking to you now as the newly elected
president of the Society for the Preservation of the
One-Man-Club for the Advancement of Testman
hip, Stanford Branch. I (we) at

Stanford have developed a system
whereby, within the bounds of the
Standamental Fundard and the
Horror Code, we are fully able
to advance ourselves over our
I'ellow classmates, effectively and,
harrrumph, "honestly."
Step 1: Geniusmanship. — Ob
viously, nothing unnerves your
fellow classmates quite as much

a-; making them think you are a
genius. To do this, several methods are proposed,
orne of them requiring the services of additional per
sonnel—namely, your friends who are not at that time
taking the course.
Routine one: you and your friend enter an Ameri
can history class before the mid-term.
"Where are the syllabi today?" you ask.
"There are none," your friend answers, ''we have
a test today."
"Oh," you answer brilliantly, "let's review" (this
discourse is proceeded upon in sufficient tone to
arouse the interests of the whole class), "who was
the attorney general under Pierce?"
"Clods!" thinks the class, "these birds know it cold."
(For those not up on their American history,
Franklin Pierce was mayor of Winegut. Nebraska,
during the 1842 election campaign. The Democratic
candidate, Winfried Fermentation, was passing
through Winegut on a whistle-stop tour. Pierce got
on the train to shake his hand. Fermentation got off
the train to go to the head, and the train left. The
Democrats, running on a skimpy budget that year,
couldn't afford to turn the train around, and Pierce
became the fourteenth president. Hi;/ attorney gen
eral was a fellow named Etaoin Shrdlu but back to
t< stmanship.)

You then grab approximately 15 blue hooks and
snare a seat in the back of the room. Within 20 min
utes after the start of the test, you walk to the front
(you have remembered, of course, to wear your thick
soled shoes), drop 14 of the 15 books on a disheveled
heap in the center of the desk, and walk out. For
your health's sake, it is advisable not to be seen by
the class when you hand in the fifteenth and written
in blue book to the professor after class.
For throwing language classes into fits, bring a
slide rule along and pretend to use it to translate.
Step 2: Stay-loosmanship.—For almost any course,
bring a Life Magazine to class, and read it while the
instructor is handing out tests. Whatever you do,
don't start your test until you have finished the
magazine—this is guaranteed to drop the average of
everyone in the class five points.
For Naval Science courses, don't try to read the
tests —they're tricky. For true and false questions,
flip a coin; for multiple choice, glance down at your
watch—whichever sector your second hand is in is
the right answer. You should finish early. So go
over each question, flipping the coin again to check
your answers.
If your (est is at eight o'clock, come in a dis
heveled tuxedo, pull off your white gloves, take
off your shoes, pull out a half-pint bottle, examine
it to be sure it is empty, and chuck it the
room) into the wastebasket.
If you are a king-sized testman, bring your type
writer to class, set it up in the middle of the room
and type out your test. As I say, you had better
be large.
TEACHERMANSHIP
Attention, teachers! To combat the above-mentioned
tactics, do not collect the blue books of your class,
but collect the yellow scratch paper instead. Have it
examined by the chemistry department for moisture
content and salt content (to differentiate between
sweat and tears). By decree of U.S. Supreme Court
(Ruling 997(>0), all aerodynamic principles written
on or folded into test papers are the exclusive prop
erty of the teachers of thut course.
