RACIAL PREJUDICE — The re
coil, suspension of the Williams
College chapter from the national
Phi Delta Theta fraternity for
pledging a Jewish student last Oc
tober in defiance of the national
constitution has been greeted with
siience or "no comments" by most
local chapters of the fraternity.
At USC, where the Jewish ques
tion is apparently a touchy one, an
editor of the "Daily Trojan" pointed
out that many houses, which do not
have discrimination clauses in their
I v -laws, still have no Jewish mem
ber. . . . the result of an unwrit
tf n law ju- t as insidious as the dis
ei-i minatory clause of the Phi Delt
national constitution.
Meanwhile, elsewhere across the
country, Northwestern students
have approved a plan whereby
roommate assignments in men's dor
it ilories may be made without ref
erence to lace. Four years ago stu
d ills had vetoed the same proposal.
N< w York University announced
that it was striking questions of
race and religion from its applica
tion forms.
Hut at the University of Alabama,
the tudent newspaper, the "Crim
: on-White," sided with the admin
istration in its decision not to ad
mit two Negro women to its gradu
al" .school. "Certainly we segregate
our schools, busses, and social
meeting," said the paper. "It's only
good sense. . . . Equal rights for
all can never become a reality until
we all feel it, and want it. . . ."

"FASHION OR FERTILIZER,"
ked a recent Oregon "Daily Em

erald" editorial criticizing the
school's yell leaders for wearing
sweaters which "hang nearly to the
knee.-; like old-style nightshirts."
The "new look" started when meas
urements for the yell leaders'
.sweater got confused, and the
sweater-maker mistook the length
from shoulder to bottom for the
length from under-arm to bottom.
Now the yell leaders like their out
fits, and refuse to change regardless
of indignant student, and alumni
protest.

ATHLETIC BIG BUSINESS —
I Students at the University of Wash
| ington are still upset about the re
cent ouster of Howie Odell as head
football coach. Newest gripe con
cerns the $15,000 separation setrte-
J ment that came out of the Asso
i ciated Students' fund. Students felt
| that since they were footing the bill,
! they should have had some say in
I the matter.

ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT
GOLD — San Jose newspapers and
radio newscasters were all excited
about the front-page story in a re
cent "Spartan Daily" announcing
that $31,395 worth ,yf stocks had
been found behind a slab of tile in
the 94-year-old ATO house.
"The stocks, mostly issued by
mining and oil companies, are dated
between 1896 and 1901," the com
mentators explained with straight
faces. Next day: chagrin, when the
romantic tale turned out. to be a
publicity hoax, designed to get the
fraternity's name before the public.

THE TRUSTING TYPES—
"Staunch Sage Set for Dates" ran
a headline in the Dartmouth Col
lege paper the day before Winter
Carnival opened. Students living in
the dorm to be turned over to vis
iting dates had hidden every con
ceivably appealing article of por
table property. Most rooms featured
a locked trunk sitting in the corner,
filled with banners, pictures, post
ers, curtains, and rufjs. First items
to be stripped from the rooms, said
the paper, were windowshades.

YOU WHO? — "Friendly Week"
was celebrated last week at Gon
] zatfa College in Spokane. Prizes
! went to the students who collected
the most autographs from fellow
students, and who identified the
most student pictures. An added
prize was given daily to whoever
discovered that day's "Who," a
mysterious student who revealed
' himself only when asked, "Are you
I who?"
