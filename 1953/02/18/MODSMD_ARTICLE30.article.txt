## The 						Dutch Disaster 
### 
To the Editor:
T am attending the Netherlands High College of
Economics this year under a Fullbright Grant, and
am writing to give you a first-hand report <;f the
flood disaster that has hit this little country. I have
just received letters from home which leave me with
tilt- impression that the American newspapers may
not have dearly revealed the full magnitude of the
disaster.
Aside from damage done by the wind. Rotterdam
112 c. ped major damage through flooding, though some
finals did spill over. The center city, however, such
ii: it is today after the Germans destroyed it in 1!t40
to "teach the Dutch a lesson," is O.K. But one does
not have to go far south of the city to the main
disiii ter area. And believe me, it is terrible. I rode
wuth over hastily repaired roads and dikes to the
town of Yundland, on the "island" of Putten with a
fellow from Cal. When I got there, I joined a group
shoveling clay around breaches in the dike at a place
seme seven kilometers out of Yundland. The little
village itself is mostly under water, the houses arc
destroyed, and some 21 people are dead after the col
lapse of a dike on which they were walking.
We had to walk the seven kilometers out and back
to work on the breaches in the dike, and there wasn't
much to walk on. Water was just inches from the

"road" in places, and dead animals were floating all
around. The worst thing was to see personal articles
floating around, such as a pair of wooden shoesâ€”a
bright yellow with red tips and designs. Shoveling the
clay was very difficult because your feet stuck in
the mud and it was difficult to move, and then the
clay stuck to the shovel. But everyone worked hard;
the Dutch are great people, with plenty of guts.
Everyone has tried to do something to help here.
I've seen very poor people lining up to leave their
donation of clothing, or even a bottle of milk, at the
refugee centers. Some 000,000 are homeless now,
and that's a lot for this small country. Imagine what
it would be like if San Francisco were destroyed and
its 650,000 people had to be looked after.
Perhaps you people at home at Stanford could con
tribute a little to help out. Believe me, these people
nre very grateful for the help coming now, and it's
a deep, humble gratitude. One American dollar will
buy 15 liters of milk here. So remember, if you
ccn collect a little money, it will buy four times as
much when it. gets here as at home. The Dutch Con
ulate or KLM office in San Francisco will be glad
to receive anything you, as individuals or collectively,
could send This is a tfreat little country. Best wishes
to you all.
