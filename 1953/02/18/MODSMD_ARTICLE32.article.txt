Tuberculosis and learning do not mix.
Thai idea is the basis for one of the most important projects of
World University Serviceâ€”a student health program designed
to keep students in foreign countries healthy enough to be able
to pursue their education.
To counteract such diseases as tuberculosis, World University

Service provides the largest sum of
money on it yearly budget to
health programs. This money, do
nated by students in the United
States and other member nations of
WUS, goes toward the payment and
administration of such projects as
the following:
Aid to a sanatorium at Leysin,
Switzerland, which provides
treatment for tubercular students
in Europe. Since 1945, World
University Service I,as contrib
uted funds which have provided
additional facilities at the sana
torium and have made possible
the treatment of do/ens of French
students.
A WUS sanatorium near Tokyo
where a rising TB rate is being
combated by funds donated to
World University Service.
Health education and medical ex
amination programs in universities
in both Europe and Asia. Special
emphasis is placed on periodical X
rays for students in India.
World University Service is ex
panding its health program proj
ects to university students all
over the world. In its "program
of action" for WUS has
planned for the following health
projects and additions to clinics
and sanatoriums already estab
lished:
Provision of special drugs to stu
dents in Greece. WUS plans to send
$1,200 worth of drugs which are
either too expensive or unavailable
there.
WUS scholarships to South Afri
can students for study in medicine.
A new project for a rest center
hostel in Cairo, which will provide
facilities for 50 students recuperat
ing from illness and disease.
Contribution of medical equip
ment to a student sanatorium
project in Turkey, where live per
cent of students given medical
exams recently showed symptoms
of TB.
Additional facilities and sana
torium projects in Rangoon, Cal
cutta, New Delhi, and other uni
versity cities in Asia.

With successful fund - raising
campaigns such as the one being
conducted at Stanford this week,
World University Service will be
able to complete such "programs of
action" and assist in the overall
problem of disease and illness
among students in foreign univer
sities.
