# Tomsic Is First Daily Athlete of the Week'
## 
### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
(The Stanford Daily Sports Staff will henceforth name a Daily Ath
lete of the Week. Kon lomsie was unanimously chosen as the lirst
winner.)

Obviously, enthusiastically, and unanimously, the first selection for "A'hlete of the Week" had
to be Ron Tomsic, guard, shooter, and floorman de luxe of Bob Burnett's cagers.
Ron, who has had some pretty fair country evenings on the hardwood, enjoyed his greatest
last Saturday night, as he led a Stanford team, which had been overwhelmed the previous night,
to a thrilling 76-74 comeback victory over USC For his evening's work, Ron collected 38 points,

a total which tied the Southern i
Division PCC record of UCLA's 1
Ed Sheldrake.
The week before, Ron collected 1
points against Bradley at the
Cow Palace( breaking the Palate
record (if 38 held by USF's Joe
McNamee), but these last .'!. X mark
ers were collected at the expense
of the hated USC and knocked
the Troians out of the PCC bas
ketball race.
Tomsic is, of course, in a posi
tion to completely rewrite Stan
lord record book basketball-wise. ]
With a grand total of 772 points j
in less than two fieafons, he is within ;
hailing distance of the all-time school [
scoring record of over 1,200 estab- i
lishcd by the immortal Hank Lui- j
.setti in 1938.
Tomsic, too, may shatter Luisetii's I
all-time game scoring record of 50
points, set against Duquesne in 1538.1
The PCC scaring record is also
within reach of the chunky 5-11
guard.
With his 57-point splurge in the
Southland, Kon took over the loop !

scoring lead with 163 points, an aver
age of 20.4 per game.
This means that in his last four
contests, against UCLA and Cali
fornia, Ron need only average 14
points per game to tie the mark of
238. set by SC's Bill Sharman.
Tomsic. of course, was more than
was more than satisfied with his
performance over the weekend. The
former Fremont High ace had al
ways had his troubles whenever
Flower guarded him.
Until recently lion's most effec
tive shot had been a jump-shot.
This he used from almost any posi
tion on the floor. Lately, Ron says.
"It's sort of depreciated," and, con
sequently, he has been relying a
lot more on a very pretty, newly
developed, driving left-handed
hook.
If Ron continues the improvement
which he has shown this year, Bob
Burnett, who will have most of the
members of this year's team return
ing, can look forward to a better
than average season next year.

Burnett, who will have most of the
members of this year's team return
ing, can look forward to a better
than average season next year.


RON TOMSIC
—Athlete of Week
(The Stanford Daily Sports Staff will henceforth name a Daily Ath
lete of the Week. Kon lomsie was unanimously chosen as the lirst
winner.)

Obviously, enthusiastically, and unanimously, the first selection for "A'hlete of the Week" had
to be Ron Tomsic, guard, shooter, and floorman de luxe of Bob Burnett's cagers.
Ron, who has had some pretty fair country evenings on the hardwood, enjoyed his greatest
last Saturday night, as he led a Stanford team, which had been overwhelmed the previous night,
to a thrilling 76-74 comeback victory over USC For his evening's work, Ron collected 38 points,

a total which tied the Southern i
Division PCC record of UCLA's 1
Ed Sheldrake.
The week before, Ron collected 1
points against Bradley at the
Cow Palace( breaking the Palate
record (if 38 held by USF's Joe
McNamee), but these last .'!. X mark
ers were collected at the expense
of the hated USC and knocked
the Troians out of the PCC bas
ketball race.
Tomsic is, of course, in a posi
tion to completely rewrite Stan
lord record book basketball-wise. ]
With a grand total of 772 points j
in less than two fieafons, he is within ;
hailing distance of the all-time school [
scoring record of over 1,200 estab- i
lishcd by the immortal Hank Lui- j
.setti in 1938.
Tomsic, too, may shatter Luisetii's I
all-time game scoring record of 50
points, set against Duquesne in 1538.1
The PCC scaring record is also
within reach of the chunky 5-11
guard.
With his 57-point splurge in the
Southland, Kon took over the loop !

scoring lead with 163 points, an aver
age of 20.4 per game.
This means that in his last four
contests, against UCLA and Cali
fornia, Ron need only average 14
points per game to tie the mark of
238. set by SC's Bill Sharman.
Tomsic. of course, was more than
was more than satisfied with his
performance over the weekend. The
former Fremont High ace had al
ways had his troubles whenever
Flower guarded him.
Until recently lion's most effec
tive shot had been a jump-shot.
This he used from almost any posi
tion on the floor. Lately, Ron says.
"It's sort of depreciated," and, con
sequently, he has been relying a
lot more on a very pretty, newly
developed, driving left-handed
hook.
If Ron continues the improvement
which he has shown this year, Bob
Burnett, who will have most of the
members of this year's team return
ing, can look forward to a better
than average season next year.
