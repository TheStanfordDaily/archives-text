# Swimmers Aim for NCAA
## 
### DON STEPHENS 
Taking a paje out of Pi.ppy Wal
dorf's book, varsity swimming coach
| Tom Haynie says his current squad
I 'should do all right—maybe as good
|as last year." •
Haynie is known lor his conserva
: tkm. but with a squad composed
mainly of sophomores and juniors,
all his men did last teason was win
the Pacific Coast Conference crown
without a defeat and place fifth out
ol Jit en trie j in the NCAA finals.
With the same squad almost intact,
it is conceivable that this year's
NCAA champs may be of Stanford
origin.
Returning veterans Larry Heim,
Ash Jones, George Mowat. Dan
O.bornc, John Miller, and Jim
Gaughran should provide the nec
essary impetus for an outstanding
team performance.
Heading the list is Gaughran,
j who showed hs talents in the
Call - Bulletin Swim Meet last
weekend by winning four events
and placing second in two. He
smashed or equaled four meet
marks in the process. As a sopho
more he notched a second plac<4
to Mowat's record-breaking 23.9
performance in the PCC playoil's.

A surprise addition to the roster
is footballer Bob Thomp.on, who,
according to Haynie, should prove
to be top material when he finally
rounds into shape.
In winning the 100- and 200-yard
events in the PCC, Heim also
placed fourth in the 200-yard back
stroke in the NCAA finals. John
Weiser placed third in the PCC's
100- and 200-yard swim sprints.
The team's strongest entry, Heim
in the backstroke, Jones in the
breaststroke, and Bob Morris in the
freestyle, should defeat all compe
tition in the 300-yard medley race.
Heim and Jones are experienced
while Morris saw limited action last
year.
Despite their fourth- and sixth
place PCC performances, Ken
Ilirsch and John Miller should
produce one of the top diving duos
on the Coast. Also a possibility
is Tom White.
PCC champ Osborne should re
peat his record-busting perform

ances in the 220 and -140 freestyle
competition.
Rounding out the 400-yard free
style relay will be Gaughran,
1 Mowat, Morris, and Jim I^ee.
It is interesting to note Haynie's
j record over the past six years. In
that time his men have won four
PCC championships, and never
placed lower than sixth in the NC

AA finals, which usually have 40
teams competing for the crown.
In the NCAA finals on March 2G
at University of Georgia at Atlanta,
the current squad is hoping to
change Haynie's "should do all
right" statement to the "best-ever
Stanford swimming season" by win
ning the coveted national crown.

The Stanford swimrning team
will open its 12 - meet season
tonight against San Jose State at
j 7:30 in the Spartan pool.

Taking a paje out of Pi.ppy Wal
dorf's book, varsity swimming coach
| Tom Haynie says his current squad
I 'should do all right—maybe as good
|as last year." •
Haynie is known lor his conserva
: tkm. but with a squad composed
mainly of sophomores and juniors,
all his men did last teason was win
the Pacific Coast Conference crown
without a defeat and place fifth out
ol Jit en trie j in the NCAA finals.
With the same squad almost intact,
it is conceivable that this year's
NCAA champs may be of Stanford
origin.
Returning veterans Larry Heim,
Ash Jones, George Mowat. Dan
O.bornc, John Miller, and Jim
Gaughran should provide the nec
essary impetus for an outstanding
team performance.
Heading the list is Gaughran,
j who showed hs talents in the
Call - Bulletin Swim Meet last
weekend by winning four events
and placing second in two. He
smashed or equaled four meet
marks in the process. As a sopho
more he notched a second plac<4
to Mowat's record-breaking 23.9
performance in the PCC playoil's.

A surprise addition to the roster
is footballer Bob Thomp.on, who,
according to Haynie, should prove
to be top material when he finally
rounds into shape.
In winning the 100- and 200-yard
events in the PCC, Heim also
placed fourth in the 200-yard back
stroke in the NCAA finals. John
Weiser placed third in the PCC's
100- and 200-yard swim sprints.
The team's strongest entry, Heim
in the backstroke, Jones in the
breaststroke, and Bob Morris in the
freestyle, should defeat all compe
tition in the 300-yard medley race.
Heim and Jones are experienced
while Morris saw limited action last
year.
Despite their fourth- and sixth
place PCC performances, Ken
Ilirsch and John Miller should
produce one of the top diving duos
on the Coast. Also a possibility
is Tom White.
PCC champ Osborne should re
peat his record-busting perform

ances in the 220 and -140 freestyle
competition.
Rounding out the 400-yard free
style relay will be Gaughran,
1 Mowat, Morris, and Jim I^ee.
It is interesting to note Haynie's
j record over the past six years. In
that time his men have won four
PCC championships, and never
placed lower than sixth in the NC

AA finals, which usually have 40
teams competing for the crown.
In the NCAA finals on March 2G
at University of Georgia at Atlanta,
the current squad is hoping to
change Haynie's "should do all
right" statement to the "best-ever
Stanford swimming season" by win
ning the coveted national crown.

The Stanford swimrning team
will open its 12 - meet season
tonight against San Jose State at
