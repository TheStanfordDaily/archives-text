double chorus, by J. S. Bach. At
I lirst, the large bass section tended
to drown out the women's voices,
but Schmidt had balanced the
voices by the end of the composi
tion.
The women's voices did well
singing "The Blessed Damozel" by
Debussy. Joan Stensen, mezzo-so
prano, sang the part of the Narra
tor, and Ruth Roehr, soprano,
showed good pitch and clear tone
as the Damozel.
Gustav Hoist's "A Dirge for Two
Veterans" was performed by the

tone, but were hampered by occa
sional sloppiness from an accom
panying group of brass and drums.
Brahms' "Nanie" closed the pro
gram. This was the chorus' best
job of the evening, with good bal
ance and good pitch. Throughout
the concert, the piano accompani
