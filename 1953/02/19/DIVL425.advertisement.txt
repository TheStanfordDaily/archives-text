If you plan to be shopping in downtown San Francisco during the holiday
weekend, make it a point to drop in at Macy's San Francisco on February 20,
or 21. In the Fourth Floor Auditorium you'll find the Ivan Collins Collection
of Historic Vehicles in Miniatureâ€”37 small, perfect models of the Victorias,
coaches, and wagons that are a picturesque part of America's history. This
collection is the only one of its kind in the United States and is the subject of
HORSE POWER DAYS, a publication of Stanford Universiy Press. Look over
the collection, talk to Mr. Collins, who will be on hand to explain how he makes
these vehicles, and take an autographed copy of the book home to your parents
or grandparents
