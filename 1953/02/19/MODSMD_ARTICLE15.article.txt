# Critic Lauds Acting of Humorous One-Acts
## 
### MARY FRAZER 
One of the year's best theater evenings came off last night in
: the Little Theater of Mem Aucl as the Winter Quarter One-Acts
; opened a three-night run.
A British-type comedy, a fairy-tale burlesque, and a third humor
! ous play make up one of the most thoroughly humorous of Ram's

j Head's productions this year. *
Nancy Lindsay as "Cinderella
j Forsooth" vies with Virginia Roycc,
j "The Egg Woman." for top honors
j among the three casts. Ronald Fein
berg as Uncle Horace of "Put It All
on Red" is excellent. All three arc
j definite comic artists, with cxtraor-
I dinary stage presence and perfect
I timing.
E Ii /, a h e 1 l» .lanss' "The Kg,'.;
Woman" pictures an egg-starved
i family and their meeting wijh
Lady Pcll-t'urcwe (Miss Roycc),
] a black marketeer.
The play begins slowly and could
' use some tightening up in its first
| ten minutes. From the entrance of
Lady Pell - Curewe, however, the
play sparkles. Paul Speer as In
spector Hicks is also excellent in
maintaining both luimor and speed
in the play.
"Cinderella Forsooth,'' Joan
; Striefling's play, is the best play of
j the three. The casting of "Cinder
j ella" is excellent, with Alicia Crow
| ell and Louise Green as the con
j vincingly shrewish stepmother and
j stepsister. Nancy Lindsay as Cin
! derella is thoroughly convulsive.
Ross Durfee's "Put It All on
Red,'' the third of the evening's
plays, is marred hy a quality of
Inittlcness. Larry and Marion
Shields (l)urfcc and Helen Davis)
are too much the «ay. bright cock
tail set to he totally amusing.
They are people seen too often in
the past ten years of theater and

♦
novel. Author Dlirfee may in
tend satire, hut if so. it is not
convincing.
Ronald Fein berg's "Uncle Hor
ace" is the saving grace of the play.
Fein berg misses no comic detail—
j the baggy suit, loud tie, and pocket
| flak, together with a beautifully
maintained hcart-of-gold erudeness
make his portrayal more totally
funny than much of what. Holly
i wood presents.
This reviewer finds the One-
Acts fine entertainment, seldom
out of their proper element, and
thoroughly funny. It is individ
ual performance rather than spec
tacular playwriting that makes the
evening so enjoyable, and thor
oughly recommended for either
tonight or tomorrow.
The Little Theater is little, but it
was filled with a capacity crowd,
all of whom left with aching sides
I and ore palms. And this reviewer
no exception.


REVEALED AT LAST -Lady Pell-Curewe, the egg woman, reveals her identity to a group of
startled friends, including Mr. and Mrs. Morten and Major and Mrs. Hedley. From left to right
are Ethbert Hedley (Jim Barton), Jocelyn Hedley (Francis Vaughn), Lady Pell-Curewe (Virginia
Royce), Mrs. Morten (Norma McCoy), and Mr. Morten (Larry Minkoff). "The Egg Woman" is
one of the three One-Acts which opened in the Little Theater last night.
