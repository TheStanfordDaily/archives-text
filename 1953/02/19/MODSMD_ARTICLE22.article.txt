# From Another Viewpoint Piety and Exuberance

### Faculty Administration ALEXANDER MILLER 
(Editor's note: Today's faculty guest column is

turer in religion at Stanford and frequent preacher

World Student Christian Association. Miller's sub
ject is "Piety and Exuberance.")

What I want more of around Stanford —which to the
amiable alien's eye has just about everything—is
exuberance. For the moment I can't think of any
other tiling that is unqualifiedly good and to be
desired in a student community. r»i;«inn

is an unmixed blessing: it de- 112
pends what kind of it you have, j
On tlie whole, I'm inclined to !
think that we have enough piety
around here; maybe too much.
I'm not too sure that it's always ,
the right sort, which is the ex
uberant sort.
But of exuberance itself the
university ought to be the very [
habitation and the home. Not only j
the bodily exuberance that keeps [

the Row alive and lifts the roof ...v,.. nuu on
Sunday nights—but exuberance of the mind and
• pirit. An intellectual curiosity busting out all over,
a less sedate approach to the kind of tragic need to
which we distantly minister through the Winter
Drive, a hearty belly laugh at the notion that you can
have a university worth the name that works within
the limits set by the McCarthys of this world, a
roaring atheism rather than the vinegary kind, a

rollicking piety rather than the pious kind.
The frustrating thing ol' course is that you can't
have exuberance by asking for it, or by trying for
it, any more than you can get true community by
working at it. Few things are more destructive of
fellowship than the "Fellowship Circle" character
istic of certain Protestant student groups, and few
things are more distressing than the spurious hearti
ness in religion which masquerades as true and exu
berant piety.
What we can do is to remind ourselves of the true
character of the liberal university, which I take to
be a rough-and-tumble sort of place in which intel
lectual asceticism, which is one form of exuberance,
rubs shoulders with intellectual license, in which
truth and error grapple in a muscle-cracking en
counter, in which politeness rates, but rates far below
frankness, in which the cardinal virtue is eagerness
and the deadly sin is cynicism, in which lukewarm
ness is, in the excellent scriptural phrase, heartily
spewed out.
Here, of course, everything depends upon the fac
ulty. The administration can help by keeping the
protagonists fed and housed and massaged; the stu
dents can help by refusing to pay for anything less
than a struggle for truth even unto blood, by asking
the most awkward of questions, by demanding that
instructors discuss not only their own subject, but
its relation to other subjects and to life in the large
and in the raw.
There ought to be no peace here, for peace plays
the very devil with scholarship. Scholars are en
gaged with truth, and truth makes protagonists and
not pedants.

a less sedate approach to the kind of tragic need to
which we distantly minister through the Winter
Drive, a hearty belly laugh at the notion that you can
have a university worth the name that works within
the limits set by the McCarthys of this world, a
roaring atheism rather than the vinegary kind, a

rollicking piety rather than the pious kind.
The frustrating thing ol' course is that you can't
have exuberance by asking for it, or by trying for
it, any more than you can get true community by
working at it. Few things are more destructive of
fellowship than the "Fellowship Circle" character
istic of certain Protestant student groups, and few
things are more distressing than the spurious hearti
ness in religion which masquerades as true and exu
berant piety.
What we can do is to remind ourselves of the true
character of the liberal university, which I take to
be a rough-and-tumble sort of place in which intel
lectual asceticism, which is one form of exuberance,
rubs shoulders with intellectual license, in which
truth and error grapple in a muscle-cracking en
counter, in which politeness rates, but rates far below
frankness, in which the cardinal virtue is eagerness
and the deadly sin is cynicism, in which lukewarm
ness is, in the excellent scriptural phrase, heartily
spewed out.
Here, of course, everything depends upon the fac
ulty. The administration can help by keeping the
protagonists fed and housed and massaged; the stu
dents can help by refusing to pay for anything less
than a struggle for truth even unto blood, by asking
the most awkward of questions, by demanding that
instructors discuss not only their own subject, but
its relation to other subjects and to life in the large
and in the raw.
There ought to be no peace here, for peace plays
the very devil with scholarship. Scholars are en
gaged with truth, and truth makes protagonists and
not pedants.

What I want more of around Stanford —which to the
amiable alien's eye has just about everything—is
exuberance. For the moment I can't think of any
other tiling that is unqualifiedly good and to be
desired in a student community. r»i;«inn

is an unmixed blessing: it de- 112
pends what kind of it you have, j
On tlie whole, I'm inclined to !
think that we have enough piety
around here; maybe too much.
I'm not too sure that it's always ,
the right sort, which is the ex
uberant sort.
But of exuberance itself the
university ought to be the very [
habitation and the home. Not only j
the bodily exuberance that keeps [

the Row alive and lifts the roof ...v,.. nuu on
Sunday nights—but exuberance of the mind and
