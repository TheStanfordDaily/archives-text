### PETE GROTHE 
No one will deny that the world of 1953 is troubled.
And why is it troubled? Following are some opinions:
Sociology Dept.: Because of multiple and interde
pendent variables.
Keen. Dept.: Because the marginal cost and mar-

ginal revenue curves don't meet.
General McArthur: Troubled?
Sure, I'm president of the board
at Remington, and I haven't
learned how to type yet.
Zeke Wallace: It's all Cardinals'
fault. Arroooooga!
Poly Sci Dept.: It's Taft's fault.
Taft: It's Truman's fault.
Truman: It's Mac-Arthur's fault.
MucArthur: It's Remington's
fault.

Kieliurd Nixon: I love my wife, Pat. I like cocker
spaniels. I like the Irish. But I hate Alger Hiss. It's
;ill his fault.
Col. Rolierl K. IVlcCoimick of the Chicago Tribune:
The world wouldn't he troubled any more if the recent

storms would have done away with England.
William Randolph Hearst's ghost: Sure, the world's
troubled. I'm not around any more.
Excoin: The world's troubled, eh? Let's appoint a
committee to investigate it.
Psych Dept.: It's a result of a catatonic stupor suf
fered by Josef Stalin's gardener when Stalin was in
the post-infant stage, thus resulting in irregular
frequency of meshing in the overt and covert actions
of Stalin.
Senator McCarthy: It's because of George C. Mar
shall and those other damn reds.
Chuck Taylor: Certainly the world's troubled. Look
at the USC score.
Pat Ward: It's all Mickey Jelke's fault.
Charles E. Wilson: I would say that money is the
root of all trouble.
Duncan ilines: It's Cellar coffee's fault.
Rally Com: Because of that damn wind at Berkeley
before Big Game.
Bull Session: What the hell. Let's go out to Lommies
and have a beer.
