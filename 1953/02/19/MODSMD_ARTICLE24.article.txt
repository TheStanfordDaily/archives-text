# CAMPUS OPINION
## Yell Leader—A Correct Solution 
### 
To the Editor:
Having been assistant, yell leaders at Stanford Uni
\« . ity and California this past year, we would like
to throw our hats into the ring and offer what we
in iievo is the correct solution to the yell leader
problem.
As everyone knows, the head yell leader is now
chosen in a popular election. This system should
rvmuin. A head yell leader should be elected on his
p> rsonality and ability to control the rooting section,
rather than on his "form" as a yell leader. However,
the major issue is the selection of the four assistant
yell leaders.
Our proposition is a compromise between selection
by the head yell leader and the student body. We
propose that after the head-yell leader is popularly
elected, he, the newly elected president of the
A.S.S.U., and three members of the Ex com, since
they are elected by the student body, form a com
mittee to select the assistant yell leaders with an
all-university tryout for those interested.
This committee, under the leadership of the head
veil leader, would facilitate the selection of the assist
ants, and, at the same time, would provide a fair
method, as the powers of the new head man would
be limited.
In addition, this committee would have a better
chance to look over the candidates through personal
interviews and tryouts on abilities to lead yells than
would the student body in a general election. The
student body, as it is, has enough difficulty becoming
acquainted with the candidates for head yell leader.
With the many choices there would be for the assist
ant posts, the burden of the student body would be
minimized, and careful selection would still he made
with this system of indirect student body representa
tion.
We only hope that the DAILY, as well as Excom,

will consider this suggestion, as we feel it to be the
solution to the problem.

(Editor's note: The plan suggested by Readers
May and Cohan is very similar to one offered to
the Cardinals by the present head yell leader,
Zeke Wallace, and rejected by (hat body after con
sideration. The Editor finds more argument for the
so-called "Compromise" plan than in the one pre
sented by Cardinals.)

To the Editor:
Having been assistant, yell leaders at Stanford Uni
\« . ity and California this past year, we would like
to throw our hats into the ring and offer what we
in iievo is the correct solution to the yell leader
problem.
As everyone knows, the head yell leader is now
chosen in a popular election. This system should
rvmuin. A head yell leader should be elected on his
p> rsonality and ability to control the rooting section,
rather than on his "form" as a yell leader. However,
the major issue is the selection of the four assistant
yell leaders.
Our proposition is a compromise between selection
by the head yell leader and the student body. We
propose that after the head-yell leader is popularly
elected, he, the newly elected president of the
A.S.S.U., and three members of the Ex com, since
they are elected by the student body, form a com
mittee to select the assistant yell leaders with an
all-university tryout for those interested.
This committee, under the leadership of the head
veil leader, would facilitate the selection of the assist
ants, and, at the same time, would provide a fair
method, as the powers of the new head man would
be limited.
In addition, this committee would have a better
chance to look over the candidates through personal
interviews and tryouts on abilities to lead yells than
would the student body in a general election. The
student body, as it is, has enough difficulty becoming
acquainted with the candidates for head yell leader.
With the many choices there would be for the assist
ant posts, the burden of the student body would be
minimized, and careful selection would still he made
with this system of indirect student body representa
tion.
We only hope that the DAILY, as well as Excom,

will consider this suggestion, as we feel it to be the
solution to the problem.
