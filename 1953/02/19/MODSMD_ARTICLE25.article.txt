the caption of the recent baseball story by Pete
Grothe. In comparison with similar articles by the
sports staff, il is consistent in being highly optimistic.
Not that this is an undesirable attitude to have (nor
unrealistic, especially for the promising baseball
team). Events have often proved it to be overly hope
ful. however, as evidenced by last year's pre-track

Let's not fill the athletes' minds with visions of

than promise and hope to produce a winner. In short,
why not be a little more objective and realistic. In
this respect, praises are due Larry Cahn for his fine
work and constructive criticisms, such as his recent
comments regarding the basketball squad's difficul
ties in maintaining peak performances.
