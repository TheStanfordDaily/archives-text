# Unbeaten Frosh Hoopsters Play Pair
## 
### RUSS WILKS 
"The remaining lour games aren't
just numbers on a list, but good
tough games," said Dick Clegg as
he sends his unbeaten freshman
basketball team against the frosh
teams of Santa Clara and San Jose
Slate this weekend.
The Papooses put their undefeat
ed string on the line for the Kith
and possibly 17th time when they
meet the Broncos in the Pavilion
Friday at 4 and host the Spartans
Saturday at 2.
Coach ( legg expects a tough
weekend against the college op
ponents and rates Santa Clara the
tougher of the two. Both teams
have good records, but the Bron
cos beat San Jo e. As far as com
mon opponents are concerned,
among Santa Clara's four losses

are defeats by St. Mary's frosh. I
USF frosh, and Bellarmine Prep, j
all by large margins. Needless
to say, the Indians won all three i
games with these opponents.
The Broncos, however, looked
good in losing to Menlo JC last
Tuesday 77-70. Big guns in the
Santa Clara attack are fast-break ;
leaders Joe Rousseau and Herb !
Bosque. Guard Dan Ball is a tricky j
playmaker and Dean Robinson is a !
dependable scorer from the outside.
The team likes to fast break and, i
therefore, Coach expects a i
high-scoring tilt.
Papoose center Denny Boren is a
doubtful starter for Friday's game
as he sprained an ankle in practice
Wednesday. If Boren can't play,
then the much-improved Paul Per
ko will open at the pivot spot.

Billy Heirs, frosh guard, has
j looked good in practice this week
| and is slated for a lot of action.
Statistics revealed this week
that Jerry Gustafson still main
tains the top field goal percentage.
He's hit :;<> field goals on 74 shots
for a 41) per cent mark. Gunnar
Christiansen is next in line with
a .'»!) per cent mark.
The frosh team has scored 1,000
points and George Selleck has
amassed a little better than one
filth of the total with 216 or an av
i erage of 14.4 points a game.
Clegg will start Bill Flanders and
Christiansen at the forwards, Boren
j or Perko at center, and Selleck and
Ron Wagner at guards. Wagner put
on an exhibition of shooting last
week when he hit 50 per ecnt of his
I shots, nine for 18.


FOUR TO GO Pictured above are six good reasons why the freshmen basketball team has
run through 15 games without a defeat. Left to right: George Selleck, Bill Flanders, Captain
Ron Wagner, Denny Boren, Jerry Gustafson and Coach Dick Clegg.

for a 41) per cent mark. Gunnar
Christiansen is next in line with

The frosh team has scored 1,000
points and George Selleck has
amassed a little better than one
filth of the total with 216 or an av
i erage of 14.4 points a game.
Clegg will start Bill Flanders and
Christiansen at the forwards, Boren
j or Perko at center, and Selleck and
Ron Wagner at guards. Wagner put
on an exhibition of shooting last
week when he hit 50 per ecnt of his
I shots, nine for 18.


FOUR TO GO Pictured above are six good reasons why the freshmen basketball team has
run through 15 games without a defeat. Left to right: George Selleck, Bill Flanders, Captain
Ron Wagner, Denny Boren, Jerry Gustafson and Coach Dick Clegg.
"The remaining lour games aren't
just numbers on a list, but good
tough games," said Dick Clegg as
he sends his unbeaten freshman
basketball team against the frosh
teams of Santa Clara and San Jose
Slate this weekend.
The Papooses put their undefeat
ed string on the line for the Kith
and possibly 17th time when they
meet the Broncos in the Pavilion
Friday at 4 and host the Spartans
Saturday at 2.
Coach ( legg expects a tough
weekend against the college op
ponents and rates Santa Clara the
tougher of the two. Both teams
have good records, but the Bron
cos beat San Jo e. As far as com
mon opponents are concerned,
among Santa Clara's four losses

are defeats by St. Mary's frosh. I
USF frosh, and Bellarmine Prep, j
all by large margins. Needless
to say, the Indians won all three i
games with these opponents.
The Broncos, however, looked
good in losing to Menlo JC last
Tuesday 77-70. Big guns in the
Santa Clara attack are fast-break ;
leaders Joe Rousseau and Herb !
Bosque. Guard Dan Ball is a tricky j
playmaker and Dean Robinson is a !
dependable scorer from the outside.
The team likes to fast break and, i
therefore, Coach expects a i
high-scoring tilt.
Papoose center Denny Boren is a
doubtful starter for Friday's game
as he sprained an ankle in practice
Wednesday. If Boren can't play,
then the much-improved Paul Per
ko will open at the pivot spot.

Billy Heirs, frosh guard, has
j looked good in practice this week
| and is slated for a lot of action.
Statistics revealed this week
that Jerry Gustafson still main
tains the top field goal percentage.

for a 41) per cent mark. Gunnar
