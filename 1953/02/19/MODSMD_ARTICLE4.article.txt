## 
### 
PARIS, Feb. 19 (UP)â€”Lord Is
may, secretary general of NATO,
announced today that the 14 At
lantic Pact partners have agreed to
restore the $224,000 cut from Gen.
Matthew B. Ridgway's "rock bottom
minimum" of $450,000,000 for NATO
defense projects.
It was a clear victory for Ridg
way, who had criticized the NATO's
ministers' mid - December decision
to cut in half his requested outlay
for construction of 126 airfields and
other bases during 1953-54.
Ismay, in his last press conference
before sailing Feb. 27 for three
weeks of conferences with top Unit
ed States and Canadian officials,
said the decision had been reached
"in principle" since the December
parley.
