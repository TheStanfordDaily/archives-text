### 
The Stanford Braves, idle the past .

i two week-, return to the Pavilion I
| court tomorrow afternoon at 4 with
their traditional rivals, the Menlo
College Oaks.
The jayvees last saw action on j
! Feb. 7 when they rolled past Stock- i
i ton JC.
Menlo boasts one of the top jun
: ior college quintets in the state with :
I 15 wins and three defeats, and is :
| comfortably situated in the top spot
in the Northern California Junior
College Coast Conference.
Big guns in the Oaks' attack are
| center Jim Crane and forward Tor
I Hansen.
Six-foot-eight Crane is one of the 1
i leading point-makers in JC circles, ;
averaging over 19 points per game.
Hansen, although ngt so prolific a
scorer, is a top rebounder

With the varsity down south, ;
Brave Coach George Lynn will not j
have too much depth to work with, 1
but will probabiy start Bob Ogorek ;
and Jim We-.tphal at forward, Ilow- |
ie Schwartz at center, and Tom I
Green and A1 Talboy at guard.
Menlo will probably line up with
j Tor Hansen and George Larraux at |
! forward, Jim Crane at center, and j
Bob Badger and Ron Eni;el at guard. 1
