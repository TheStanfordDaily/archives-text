The Story of a BARGAIN
There are glamorous sisters now at Stanford whose father was a ZETE back in the early! thirties
—and I was sending six of them to Europe.
Third class round-trip passage on the SS WASHINGTON cost 5142.00
while on the SS HARDING it cost 136.00
I tried very hard to get them to take the WASHINGTON —a larger ship, better facilities, andj
opportunities for much more fun.
But they thought hard, "Six bucks is six bucks—6 x 6 = $36.00, and that'll buy a lot of ham
sandwiches." So being smart lads, they took the cheapest bargain.
The following September they dropped in to thank their Travel Agent, reporting "A WONDER
FUL summer, and thanks a million for everything."
"How did you like your ship?" I asked.
"Oh it was alright, but we realized we should have taken your advice . . . We didn't
know the difference, you did ... it wasn't worth the saving."
This could happen to you. Study your bargain, examine the merits of each offer, find out exactly
WHAT you are buying, what you are getting.
