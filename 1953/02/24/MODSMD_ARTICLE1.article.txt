# Be a Traveler, Not a Typical Tourist
## Study Europe, Meet People, Have Fun and—Bon Voyage 
### PETE GROTHE 
No other tourist but the American spends so much money in Europe and gets so few returns
from it.
It's a truism that the average American tourist has about as much conception of how to travel
as Josef Stalin knows how to diagram a trap play with the fullback carrying over right guard.
Fortunately, students know how to travel better than the average American tourist, but still

many of them strike out with*
the bases loaded when it comes
to getting the full increment of
pleasure out of travel.
Following arc six suggestions . . . I
few of which will be found in the
glamorous, multi - colored travel i
folders . . . aimed at opening new I

r
horizons to the neophyte student
traveler.
1. Try to avoid tours. They arc j
| usually too regimented for anyone
i with a spark of individualism. Too
often we have seen a disillusioned
tourist hear a tour leader say, "All :
right, we will all get up at 8:15 a.m..
cat breakfast at !) a.m., spend 4P
minutes in this museum, and one
hour !'G minutes in this art gallery."
Also, one of the most desirable
; things an American traveler can do
is to meet as many Europeans as
j possible. And about the only con
| t ; ict a person in tour has with a Eu
ropean is the English-speaking
; waiter in the restaurant.
This is not meant to be a blanket
criticism of tours. Many persons'
personalities are geared for tours,
and there arc many well-conducted
- . tudent tours that are very worth
i while.
2. The travel folders would have
you believe that seeing Europe
means seeing places. This is only
half right. As important as the
Louvre, the Tower of London, and
the Coliseum arc, some of the most
treasured memories a tourist will
carry home arc meetings and talks
with persons.
Try to line up "contacts" before
you go to Europe . . . people you
know who live over there or per
sons that friends Rive you the ad
dress of. Undisputablv. the best
way to see a country is to Ix* shown

by a native of that country.
Also, picking up a hitch-hiker in
Austria, talking with an English
man in a London pub, striking up a
conversation with a Frenchman in
a Paris cafe on Rue Monsieur !e
Prince, or chatting with a German
hi a Munich beer hall is as valuable
an experience as spending a few
hours in Westminster Abbey.
# • #
.'!. A good suggestion is always
doing a little studying on places you
are going. They have more signifi
cance then. Also make an attempt
to learn a few of the common
phrases used in the countries. Eu-
appreciate this.
!. Europeans criticize us because
we never walk. We always have to
rely on a cnr. And the Europeans
have grounds for their criticism.
The only way to properly sec a city
(like Paris, for example) is to walk
through every section of the city.
Not only the beauty spots and the
brines, but also shopping districts,
the waterfronts, and the slums.
It's not until you finish a two
month trek abroad that you realize
it's the little things that constitute
the bulk of your trip . . . watching
the crazy Paris taxi drivers from
the salety of a cafe.
Trying to figure out howinell to
say "Where is the john?" in French
. . . you know it isn't "Ou est lo
jean?' ; watching a five - year - old
kid in a small French town outside

of Dijon drinking wine and wonder
ing where the 8.0. E. is: being
amazed by the Finns Nordic good
looks and their impossible language;
going to Hyde Park in London and
watching three evangelists, two
atheists, and a Communist speaking
from soapboxes to small audiences
and wondering what wouid happen
if they were .ill brought together.
Yes, it's the little memories, not

found in the guide books, that arc
so important. Don't overlook them
for the big thing .
fi. Finally, there's a matter of at
titude. Too many Americans go
over with "the attitude that America
is the biggest, the best, the richest,
and the nicest country in the world
and that Europe has nothing to olTcr
that America hasn't got.

li thi> is your attitude. tlu> best
uggestion is to stay at home.
However, if you go abroad with
the idea that you can learn some
thing from the French about the art
of living, something from the Ger
mans about food, something from
the Swiss about cleanliness and
something from the English about
courage and a sense of humor . . .
then your trip will be u success.

No other tourist but the American spends so much money in Europe and gets so few returns
from it.
It's a truism that the average American tourist has about as much conception of how to travel
as Josef Stalin knows how to diagram a trap play with the fullback carrying over right guard.
Fortunately, students know how to travel better than the average American tourist, but still

many of them strike out with*
the bases loaded when it comes
to getting the full increment of
pleasure out of travel.
Following arc six suggestions . . . I
few of which will be found in the
glamorous, multi - colored travel i
folders . . . aimed at opening new I

r
horizons to the neophyte student
traveler.
1. Try to avoid tours. They arc j
| usually too regimented for anyone
i with a spark of individualism. Too
often we have seen a disillusioned
tourist hear a tour leader say, "All :
right, we will all get up at 8:15 a.m..
cat breakfast at !) a.m., spend 4P
minutes in this museum, and one
hour !'G minutes in this art gallery."
Also, one of the most desirable
; things an American traveler can do
is to meet as many Europeans as
j possible. And about the only con
| t ; ict a person in tour has with a Eu
ropean is the English-speaking
; waiter in the restaurant.
This is not meant to be a blanket
criticism of tours. Many persons'
personalities are geared for tours,
and there arc many well-conducted
- . tudent tours that are very worth
i while.
2. The travel folders would have
you believe that seeing Europe
means seeing places. This is only
half right. As important as the
Louvre, the Tower of London, and
the Coliseum arc, some of the most
treasured memories a tourist will
carry home arc meetings and talks
with persons.
Try to line up "contacts" before
you go to Europe . . . people you
know who live over there or per
sons that friends Rive you the ad
dress of. Undisputablv. the best
way to see a country is to Ix* shown

by a native of that country.
Also, picking up a hitch-hiker in
Austria, talking with an English
man in a London pub, striking up a
conversation with a Frenchman in
a Paris cafe on Rue Monsieur !e
Prince, or chatting with a German
hi a Munich beer hall is as valuable
an experience as spending a few
hours in Westminster Abbey.

.'!. A good suggestion is always
doing a little studying on places you
are going. They have more signifi

to learn a few of the common
phrases used in the countries. Eu-
appreciate this.
!. Europeans criticize us because
we never walk. We always have to
rely on a cnr. And the Europeans
have grounds for their criticism.
The only way to properly sec a city

through every section of the city.

No other tourist but the American spends so much money in Europe and gets so few returns
from it.
It's a truism that the average American tourist has about as much conception of how to travel
as Josef Stalin knows how to diagram a trap play with the fullback carrying over right guard.
Fortunately, students know how to travel better than the average American tourist, but still

many of them strike out with*
the bases loaded when it comes
to getting the full increment of
pleasure out of travel.
Following arc six suggestions . . . I
few of which will be found in the
glamorous, multi - colored travel i
folders . . . aimed at opening new I

r
horizons to the neophyte student
traveler.
1. Try to avoid tours. They arc j
| usually too regimented for anyone
i with a spark of individualism. Too
often we have seen a disillusioned
tourist hear a tour leader say, "All :
right, we will all get up at 8:15 a.m..
cat breakfast at !) a.m., spend 4P
minutes in this museum, and one
hour !'G minutes in this art gallery."
Also, one of the most desirable
; things an American traveler can do
is to meet as many Europeans as
j possible. And about the only con
| t ; ict a person in tour has with a Eu
ropean is the English-speaking
; waiter in the restaurant.
This is not meant to be a blanket
criticism of tours. Many persons'
personalities are geared for tours,
and there arc many well-conducted
- . tudent tours that are very worth
i while.
2. The travel folders would have
you believe that seeing Europe
means seeing places. This is only
half right. As important as the
Louvre, the Tower of London, and
the Coliseum arc, some of the most
treasured memories a tourist will
carry home arc meetings and talks
with persons.

you go to Europe . . . people you
