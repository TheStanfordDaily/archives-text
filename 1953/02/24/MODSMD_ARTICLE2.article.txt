# SUMMER, 1953: IT'S TIME TO TRAVEL
## Traveler's Aid A La Stanford 
### WALT MENNINGER Editorial Assistant, The Daily 
This week is Travel Week, a la Stanford.
And during the coming summer, as in recent summers, a size
able portion of Stanford, to get relief from the usual methods of
education, will movre abroad to gain an understanding of the
accomplishments and idiosyncrasies of other cultures.
To accommodate these emigrants to other parts of the world
come June, special preparations are being made in every coun
try. From the local level—right here at Stanford —to the govern
mental level, the prospective traveler is finding extra special

'co-operation.
Here at Stanford, the student Insti
tute of International Relations i.s
offering its informational services
and experience to all those students
who desire assistance. This same
outgoing attitude is evinced by the
local travel agencies.

Above all, however, the national
tourist offices of foreign govern
ments, with their reams of literature
and posters, have presented to this
year's traveler an enticing picture of
the life abroad. And these agencies
have done more than their part to
provide help to Americans going to
Paris, and Madrid, and Rome, and
Heidelberg.
Needless to say, there will be more
in Europe and other foreign coun
tries than meets the casual tourist's
eye; and students this summer will
have plenty of opportunities to see
more than the Mona Lisa or the
white cliffs of Dover. The foreign
nations are doing their best to make
sure of this.

To give students ideas on how to
do this—how to sec more of Europe
than ordinarily meets the eye, how
to gain an understanding of the ways
of life of more people' than live in
these United States—the Stanford
lIR is sponsoring a travel week.
The events of this week, accord
ing to Toby Schreiber, who has taken
care of most of the arrangements for
the week, have a threefold purpose:
1. To give students already plan
ning to go abroad a student view
point on what to take, what to see
over there, and how to go about do
ing it.
2. To encourage those students
who are hesitant about going to
make up their minds before sailing
and tour openings arc closed.
3. To inform both those students
already planning to go abroad, and
also those who piay be interested in
going, just what there is available
in the way of tours, both on a local
and national level.

This summer, the American trav
eler, as an ambassador of this coun
try, will have a great opportunity
before him, but the best way to take
advantage of that opportunity is
through careful preparation.
This week, the Stanford student
will be given several ideas on that
"careful preparation."
