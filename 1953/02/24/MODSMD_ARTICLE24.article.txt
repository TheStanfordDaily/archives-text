### MIKE HUDSON Daily Sports Editor 
If you're an American sports
fan, Europe is not the place for
you.
The beet attractions Europe
can offer in the sports world are
cross-country auto and motor
cycle races.
Each European country holds one
grand prix motorcycle race and auto
race. Up to 400,000 people watch
these races as they roar over the
roads and hills of Europe.
Another top event is the Isle of
Man motorcycle races in late June.
A 38-mile track, rising from '.ea
level to 2,00(1 feet, circles the tin\
island. The cycles average over !M)
miles an hour in their six laps
around the track. Good motorcycle
racing is also held weekly in
Wembley Stadium and other
arenas throughout Europe.

The smaller cities hold bicycle
races. These are also run through
the city streets and are going on al
most constantly. The tour de France
from Paris to Spain, in July, is the ;
biggest bicycle race in the world.
A sport not seen in America, but
seen in Spain and the lands South
of the Border is bull fighting. Opin
ions vary on whether this scene from
a slaughter house is stark drama or
stark insanity, but you might see j
one for the experience.
Britain holds its All-British Isles
track meets before crowds of 40,0150
pihl up, hut the limes don't match
those that Stanford and LSC will
hit this April.
Cricket is an interesting sport, j
some games lasting two clays.
Soocer is the major sport, but the: 1
i.ig rnatche; before crowds of 100,000
are playod in the spring. Nevertho- i
less, the bir soccer leagues are now '
in full swing and the grade of soccer i
played is better than any you'il see
around here.
