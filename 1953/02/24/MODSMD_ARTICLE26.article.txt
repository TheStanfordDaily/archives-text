# Health Service Offers Free Immunizations

Disease travels in the summer, too.
For this reason students who will
be visiting foreign countries this
June should be protected through a
series of vaccinations and shots.
In fact, to seek return admittance
to the United States, students must
certify that they have been vacci
nated against smallpox within a
year of their return.
All countries require smallpox
vaccinations. In addition, it is rec
ommended that travelers to Europe,
Japan, and Mexico have tetanus,
typhoid-paratyphoid and tetanus in
jections.
These three injections plus protec
tion against cholera are required for
travel in the Middle East, South Sea
Islands, or in Asia. Yellow fever
innoculations are also recommended
for visitors to South America and
the Carribean Islands.
Applicants for passports will re
ceive an International Certificate of
Immunization. After students have
been innoculated, the card may be
filled out by health authorities. The
immunization record must be car
ried with other traveling papers.
Students may start shots at the
Health Service any time.
At present Monday and Wednes
day have been set aside for students
to obtain tetanus and typhoid shots
