## Traveler Recounts Her Many Memories of Europe 
### MAIZIE MAY 
How can I ever forget them . . . Erika, the German girl I hitch
hiked from Heidelberg to Basle with; my first German lesson from
Brigilta, who could hardly speak Enqlish; the Danish family that
we sang folk songs with as they gave us a lift to Kolding; the
wonderful pen-pal whom I finally met after a six years' corres-

pondence; the spontaneous in
ternational party in the Silke
borg youth hostel.
jDyster fishing in Marenne; teach
ing the French orphans how to play
thr "Farmer in the Dell"; the poly
*?iot rising bell in the modern, con
verted bomb shelter of a youth hos
tel in Cologne; Jacques, the work
camp's singing pastor; eating lunch
: n the courtyard of an old woman's
home in Aarhus.
Playing chess with Paul, the boy
without a country since he dared
not go back to Hungary; Artur, who
was never without his dictionary;
and five of us sleeping full length in
the third-class compartment of the
night train to Paris!
Yes, it was a wonderful sum
mer—from the moment I stepped
on board the Anna Salen bound
for Helsinki, till I proudly took my
German bicycle down oft" the car
at home three months later. I
traveled by student ship, private
car, train, foot, thumb, bicycle, bus,
and ferry. I recommend them all.
The student ship may not be
luxurious, but for activity on the
long trip you can't desire any more.
There are well-informed lectures
and discussions on the countries you
will visit, classes in seven or eight
languages, talent shows, contests and
interest groups on art, music or any
thing else the passengers may desire.
Whatever else you may do, you
cannot help meeting your fellow
shipmates. They arc people going
home for the summer, or students
and teachers going to conferences,
or just going to "bum" around
Europe. Many plan to stay in hos
tels and to hitch-hike or cycle, to
see as much as they can, meet as
many people as they can, and all
as cheaply as they can.
I spent two months in Europe,
from landing in Copenhagen until
nearly missing the ship in Zeebruge.
Two months of complete and abso
lute freedom. I had no deadlines,
no reservations, save two. The pur
pose of my trip was to go to a work
camp for four weeks in August, and
I had told my pen-pal that I should
be in Yenne the last of July.
And so I described a great circle
from Copenhagen through Denmark,
to Germany, up the Rhine to Swit
zerland, around through the south of
France to the camp. Alter camp,
came Paris, thence to Belgium and
home, via Canada. I stayed in youth
hostels and earnestly believe that
there is no better way for American
youth to meet the youth of other
lands.

♦
At the camp I met them and
j lived with them—2s from Envland,
I Denmark, Sweden, Africa, Portu
gal, Germany and France. We
worked si'* hours a dav, six days
! a week, repairing a manor house
j for a vacation home for poor fami
lies.
How can I say it a!!? I haven't
mentioned the historical sights, the
j art galleries or other cultuial at
j tractions. They were there. I saw
j them, often half-price, thanks to my
j hostel pass, and I loved them, as I
] loved everything else about this

' which I began to know and under
stand Europe and its people.

How can I say it a!!? I haven't
mentioned the historical sights, the
j art galleries or other cultuial at
j tractions. They were there. I saw
j them, often half-price, thanks to my
j hostel pass, and I loved them, as I
] loved everything else about this
| wonderful adventurous summer in
' which I began to know and under
stand Europe and its people.
How can I ever forget them . . . Erika, the German girl I hitch
hiked from Heidelberg to Basle with; my first German lesson from
Brigilta, who could hardly speak Enqlish; the Danish family that
we sang folk songs with as they gave us a lift to Kolding; the
wonderful pen-pal whom I finally met after a six years' corres-

pondence; the spontaneous in
ternational party in the Silke
borg youth hostel.
jDyster fishing in Marenne; teach
ing the French orphans how to play
thr "Farmer in the Dell"; the poly
*?iot rising bell in the modern, con
verted bomb shelter of a youth hos
tel in Cologne; Jacques, the work
camp's singing pastor; eating lunch
: n the courtyard of an old woman's
home in Aarhus.
Playing chess with Paul, the boy
without a country since he dared
not go back to Hungary; Artur, who
was never without his dictionary;
and five of us sleeping full length in
the third-class compartment of the
night train to Paris!
Yes, it was a wonderful sum
mer—from the moment I stepped
on board the Anna Salen bound
for Helsinki, till I proudly took my
German bicycle down oft" the car
at home three months later. I
traveled by student ship, private
car, train, foot, thumb, bicycle, bus,
and ferry. I recommend them all.
The student ship may not be
luxurious, but for activity on the
long trip you can't desire any more.
There are well-informed lectures
and discussions on the countries you
will visit, classes in seven or eight
languages, talent shows, contests and
interest groups on art, music or any
thing else the passengers may desire.
Whatever else you may do, you
cannot help meeting your fellow
shipmates. They arc people going
home for the summer, or students
and teachers going to conferences,
or just going to "bum" around
Europe. Many plan to stay in hos
tels and to hitch-hike or cycle, to
see as much as they can, meet as
many people as they can, and all
as cheaply as they can.
I spent two months in Europe,
from landing in Copenhagen until
nearly missing the ship in Zeebruge.
Two months of complete and abso
lute freedom. I had no deadlines,
no reservations, save two. The pur
pose of my trip was to go to a work
camp for four weeks in August, and
I had told my pen-pal that I should
be in Yenne the last of July.
And so I described a great circle
from Copenhagen through Denmark,
to Germany, up the Rhine to Swit
zerland, around through the south of
France to the camp. Alter camp,
came Paris, thence to Belgium and
home, via Canada. I stayed in youth
hostels and earnestly believe that
there is no better way for American
youth to meet the youth of other
lands.

j lived with them—2s from Envland,
