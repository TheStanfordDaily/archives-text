## Mail, Money, Motels, Mules-Travel Agents Have the Answer to Almost any Question 
### BARBARA TUERK 
"What's the temperature like in Montevideo?"
"Can I take my pets on the plane?"
"How will my mail reach me?"
Pick a guestion—any old guestion, just so long as it's vaguely
lelated to travel, and chances are that a travel agent can answer it.

Travel agents are experts on any
! thing and everything about travel,
Ade Lurie of the University Travel
Service in Palo Aito explains. "How
can they help it?" lie asks. "They
! spend eight hours a day thinking
about nothing else."
Primarily, the travel agency serves
j as a clearing house for reservations,
j tickets, and information about all
j types of travel. It .serves as a sales
' office for carriers and hotels which
could not afford to establish local
I agencies alone.
The public pays almost nothing
for the agent's services, because his
income comes from commissions paid
him by the firms he represents.
A good travel agent works also
to popularize travel by making it
as easy as possible for the public.
I Because be represents almost all
carriers anil hotels, his sugges
tions about the best boat or botel

—
are bound to be impartial.
If you should go into one of the
Palo Alto travel agencies, either i
University or Bungey-Street Travel
Service, for instance, the agent
would begin finding out what general
area you wanted to visit.
Suppose it's Europe. The agent j
would describe all the possible ways |
to make the trip. Boat or plane? j
Tour-guided or independent? Car, I
trains, or bicycle once you get there? :
How much money? How much time? ;
Lurie says that bis office is used ]
to handling all kinds of people—
from those who wander in saying,
"i have $350 and three weeks, I
where should I go?" to those who j
march in. "I've read all the books !
and typed my itinerary; get me my
reservations."
After the agent has a vague idea j
of what you want, he begins recom- !

rpending specific tours and places.
"Your first trip to Europe, you should
listen to the voice of experience,"
Lurie warns. "A person who deals
with Europe daily can he trusted
more than the kid down the hall."
If you'd rather go aione than on a
tour, the agent can get you trans
portation, guides, hotels, and local
sight-seein?' trips. If there ever is a
service charge, it is for such inde
pendent tours.
"Howevef," Lurie explains, "ri
valry for the college student business
is so highly competitive that such
charges are usually negligible."
As for information, the travel
agent's stock is seemingly unlimited,
lie can answer questions about
duly regulations and foreign cur
rency, visas, passports, and vac
cinations, baggage rates and in
surance. lie knows all about the
weather and the local customs. He
knows what to tip, where to shop,
and where to play. He can give
you the low-down on cars and
crossing borders and police regu
lations.
"Generally speaking," Mr. Lurie
sums it all up, "the agent can save
you money. Either as money itself
or on the theory that time equals
money. He can always show you
the easiest, quickest way to make
your trip. And often he or his Euro

| pean representative can get you
I rooms when you couldn't get one
alone, or at wholesale rates."
Because of these services travel
agencies have grown tremendously
since the war. A major steamship
company said that !)l) percent of
its bookings from Northern Cali
i fornia last year were made through
' travel agents.
With this increased service, the
j agents now consider themselves pro
i fessionnl men, rather than merchants.
They have even formed an American
I "guild" of travel agents which li
! censes an agent only after he has
i proved his worth for several years

lelated to travel, and chances are that a travel agent can answer it.

Travel agents are experts on any
! thing and everything about travel,
Ade Lurie of the University Travel
Service in Palo Aito explains. "How
can they help it?" lie asks. "They
! spend eight hours a day thinking
about nothing else."
Primarily, the travel agency serves
j as a clearing house for reservations,
j tickets, and information about all
j types of travel. It .serves as a sales
' office for carriers and hotels which
could not afford to establish local
I agencies alone.
The public pays almost nothing
for the agent's services, because his
income comes from commissions paid
him by the firms he represents.
A good travel agent works also
to popularize travel by making it
as easy as possible for the public.
I Because be represents almost all
carriers anil hotels, his sugges
tions about the best boat or botel

—
are bound to be impartial.
If you should go into one of the
Palo Alto travel agencies, either i
University or Bungey-Street Travel
Service, for instance, the agent
would begin finding out what general
area you wanted to visit.
Suppose it's Europe. The agent j
would describe all the possible ways |
to make the trip. Boat or plane? j
Tour-guided or independent? Car, I
trains, or bicycle once you get there? :
How much money? How much time? ;
Lurie says that bis office is used ]
to handling all kinds of people—
from those who wander in saying,
"i have $350 and three weeks, I
where should I go?" to those who j
march in. "I've read all the books !
and typed my itinerary; get me my
reservations."
After the agent has a vague idea j
of what you want, he begins recom- !

rpending specific tours and places.
"Your first trip to Europe, you should
listen to the voice of experience,"
Lurie warns. "A person who deals
with Europe daily can he trusted
more than the kid down the hall."
If you'd rather go aione than on a
tour, the agent can get you trans
portation, guides, hotels, and local
sight-seein?' trips. If there ever is a
service charge, it is for such inde
pendent tours.
"Howevef," Lurie explains, "ri
valry for the college student business
is so highly competitive that such
charges are usually negligible."
As for information, the travel
agent's stock is seemingly unlimited,
lie can answer questions about
duly regulations and foreign cur
rency, visas, passports, and vac
cinations, baggage rates and in
surance. lie knows all about the
weather and the local customs. He
knows what to tip, where to shop,
and where to play. He can give
you the low-down on cars and
crossing borders and police regu
lations.
"Generally speaking," Mr. Lurie
sums it all up, "the agent can save
you money. Either as money itself
or on the theory that time equals
money. He can always show you
the easiest, quickest way to make
your trip. And often he or his Euro

| pean representative can get you
I rooms when you couldn't get one
alone, or at wholesale rates."
Because of these services travel
agencies have grown tremendously
since the war. A major steamship
company said that !)l) percent of
its bookings from Northern Cali
i fornia last year were made through
' travel agents.
With this increased service, the
j agents now consider themselves pro
i fessionnl men, rather than merchants.
They have even formed an American
I "guild" of travel agents which li
! censes an agent only after he has
i proved his worth for several years

! spend eight hours a day thinking
about nothing else."
Primarily, the travel agency serves
j as a clearing house for reservations,
j tickets, and information about all
j types of travel. It .serves as a sales
' office for carriers and hotels which
could not afford to establish local
I agencies alone.
The public pays almost nothing
for the agent's services, because his
income comes from commissions paid
him by the firms he represents.
A good travel agent works also
to popularize travel by making it
as easy as possible for the public.
I Because be represents almost all
carriers anil hotels, his sugges
tions about the best boat or botel

—
are bound to be impartial.
If you should go into one of the
Palo Alto travel agencies, either i
University or Bungey-Street Travel
Service, for instance, the agent
would begin finding out what general
area you wanted to visit.
Suppose it's Europe. The agent j
would describe all the possible ways |
to make the trip. Boat or plane? j
Tour-guided or independent? Car, I
trains, or bicycle once you get there? :
How much money? How much time? ;
Lurie says that bis office is used ]
to handling all kinds of people—
from those who wander in saying,
"i have $350 and three weeks, I
where should I go?" to those who j
march in. "I've read all the books !
and typed my itinerary; get me my
reservations."
After the agent has a vague idea j
of what you want, he begins recom- !

rpending specific tours and places.
"Your first trip to Europe, you should
listen to the voice of experience,"
Lurie warns. "A person who deals
with Europe daily can he trusted
more than the kid down the hall."
If you'd rather go aione than on a
tour, the agent can get you trans
portation, guides, hotels, and local
sight-seein?' trips. If there ever is a
service charge, it is for such inde
pendent tours.
"Howevef," Lurie explains, "ri
valry for the college student business
is so highly competitive that such
charges are usually negligible."
As for information, the travel
agent's stock is seemingly unlimited,
lie can answer questions about
duly regulations and foreign cur
rency, visas, passports, and vac
cinations, baggage rates and in
surance. lie knows all about the
weather and the local customs. He
knows what to tip, where to shop,
and where to play. He can give
you the low-down on cars and
crossing borders and police regu
lations.
"Generally speaking," Mr. Lurie
sums it all up, "the agent can save
you money. Either as money itself
or on the theory that time equals
money. He can always show you
the easiest, quickest way to make
your trip. And often he or his Euro

| pean representative can get you
I rooms when you couldn't get one
alone, or at wholesale rates."
Because of these services travel
agencies have grown tremendously
since the war. A major steamship
company said that !)l) percent of
its bookings from Northern Cali
i fornia last year were made through
' travel agents.
With this increased service, the
j agents now consider themselves pro
i fessionnl men, rather than merchants.
They have even formed an American
I "guild" of travel agents which li
! censes an agent only after he has
i proved his worth for several years
