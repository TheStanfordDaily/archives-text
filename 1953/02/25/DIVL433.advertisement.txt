ergies to Soeial Pur
suits, with correspondingly little emphasis on
the Curriculum in the Catalogue. Conse
quently, while lie was Kight Up There
socially, he had academically just about
reached the Point of No Return.
Topping it off was an Ultimatum from the
Male Patent, warning that on hi* next
arrival home, lie had better lie accompanied
either by a List of Passing Grades or a
Social Security Card. All Our Boy could see
ahead was a lifetime at Hard Labor, unless
Something Drastic happened.
So he made it happen. Invested heavily
in benzedrine and black coffee and lined up
three super-skull Tutors, \ight and day h«
Sweated It Out. Made it, too! Wound up,
if not with Flying ("olors, at least with
Respectable Crades. First thing lie did,
naturally, was to call Western Union anil
flash the Joyous Tidings homeward by tele,
gram. Then he sat back and waited for
the Reaction.
It came, an hour later. A Telegraphic Moner
Order for $.">OO, plus a message that read:
"Delighted at your confounding the Proph
ets, including myself. Hope you will join me
on two-month European trip, expenses paid,
starting June 20th." Signed, POP.
Moral? When you've got good news to
impart, strike while the Item is Hot—by
Telegram! It adds weight, as well as wing-,
to Your Word'-. In mix kind of Communi'pie,
from Date Talk to Dream Talk to Job Talk,
you'll get farther, fasier, when you use thu
Yellow lllank. Just call Western Union.
