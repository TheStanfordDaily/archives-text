# Student Models Will Exhibit Travel Fashions in IIR Show
## 
### 
"What to Wear in Europe?" This
question will be partially answered
for Stanford men and women when
the lIR presents a fashion show at
7:30 in Cubberley Auditorium.
The program is one of the high
lights of Travel Week.
With emphasis on simplicity and
usefulness, Peninsula merchants
will show travel togs which are ex
pected to catch the student's eye
and at the same time give him a
hint on necessities for traveling

abroad. Students will serve as mod
els.
Men attending the show will be
particularly interested in sport cars
that, will be on display outside Cub
berley before and after the show.
The cars will be open for inspection.
After the fashion parade, a movie
on European travel will be shown
and refreshments will be served.
Gail Thompson, who has been in
charge of arranging the show, will
also moderate the program.
