And if you know his story, you
sometimes look at him and marvel
that he is.
It happened last spring, when Ken
was a member of the Yellow Devil
Squadron, stationed on the carrier
USS Valley Forge oil Korea.
At 1,200 feet over Wongsang-ni
in North Korea an enemy anti
aircraft shell shattered the cockpit
of Ken's Skyraidcr. He was
knocked unconscious. Instinctively,
he pulled hack on his slick and
his dive bomber began a sharp
climb.
From then on, he couldn't think
of much beside the blood that was
oozing from his face and the two
trip hammers beating on the back
of his head. Then he heard a voice
bark over his radio:
"This is Thayer—this is Thayer.

Put your nose down quick! Get it
over!"
It was Howie Thayer—Ken's room
mate on the Valley Forge—talking
from another plane out on the same
mission. He'd heard Ken cry over
his radio, "I'm blind! For God's sake,
help me; I'm blind!" And he'd come
to help.
The sound of Thayer's voice
brought Ken around. He pulled
his plane out of the cloud bank it
i was headed into and turned back
toward the earth.
"You're doing all right now," hp
i heard Thayer say calmly. "Pull back
j a little; we can level ofT now."
They headed for Wonsan. Thayer
; thought maybe Ken could bail out
| near one of the destroyers.
But lost blood was making Ken
steadily weaker. A shell fragment
had caught him near the right side
i of his nose and had ripped diagonally
j across his cheek. Tiny steel frag

merits had pierced his eyes. And the
pain was starting in.
They approached Wonsan and
Thayer realized that jumping out
was out of the question. Itailing
out into the cold water was hard
enough for pilots in good condition.
So they flew along the coast,
Thayer constantly scanning the
countryside for a place to land, con
stantly guiding Ken with his voice.
Finally he say-a clear spot ahead.
An abandoned landing strip.
It was that or nothing. Ken was
barely conscious. Thayer started
taking him down.
"Left wing over, down slowly, nose
over easy. Little more .. . gear
j down."
"To hell with that!" Though
hurt and Mind. Ken still remem
bered that in an emergency it's
safer to land on your belly than in
the usual wheels-down manner.
It lowered the chances of ripping
off a wing or doing a nose-over
from bitting the runway off
balance.
From somewhere Ken got. the
strength to follow the orders that
brought him to the ground, where
his plane slid along on its belly and
finally came to rest all in one piecc.
Circling above, Thayer saw Ken
climb from the plane into the arms
of the field attendants. Then ho
made for the landing deck of the
Valley Forge.
A group of officers crowded
around his plane as he climbed
out. All through the ordeal, the
Air Operations radio speaker had
been tuned in on the transmission
between the two pilots. Fveryonc
aboard ship had followed their

Squadron, stationed on the carrier

At 1,200 feet over Wongsang-ni
in North Korea an enemy anti
aircraft shell shattered the cockpit
of Ken's Skyraidcr. He was
knocked unconscious. Instinctively,
he pulled hack on his slick and
his dive bomber began a sharp
climb.
From then on, he couldn't think
of much beside the blood that was
oozing from his face and the two
trip hammers beating on the back
of his head. Then he heard a voice
bark over his radio:
"This is Thayer—this is Thayer.

Put your nose down quick! Get it
over!"
It was Howie Thayer—Ken's room
mate on the Valley Forge—talking
from another plane out on the same
mission. He'd heard Ken cry over
his radio, "I'm blind! For God's sake,
help me; I'm blind!" And he'd come
to help.
The sound of Thayer's voice
brought Ken around. He pulled
his plane out of the cloud bank it

his radio, "I'm blind! For God's sake,
