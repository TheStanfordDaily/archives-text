# Yell Leader Election System
## 
### 
Tonight, after a quarter and a half of investi
gation by Cardinals and a month of. hassling in
Excom, some specific proposal for revamping
the yell leader election system should be
?dopted by the Executive Committee
The Daily learned yesterday that one and
probably two plans, similar in many respects,
were finally being put on paper in usable form.
Excom undoubtedly would have reached
agreement last week if it had been given a pro
posal on paper to work from.
As the situation now stands, there are at
least four alternatives (and possibly more) open
to the Executive Committee.
One: Leave As Is
Numbei one, it could decide to leave the yell
leader election system as it now stands. At
present, any member of the Associated Stu
dents is eligible to be included in the six candi
dates nominated for head yell leader by the
Yell Leader Nominations Committee.
The committee is now composed of the
ASSU president, the two student members at
large of the SAB, two members of Excom (one
of whom shall be a woman), and the chairman
of Rally Committee.
Plan Two
Plan Two is officially recommended by
Cardinals.
Under this system, only the incumbent as
sistant yell leaders would be eligible to run
lor head yell leader.
The Nominations Committee would be
changed to include the following members:
ASSU president and vice-president, the in
cumbent head yell leader, a member cf the
faculty or administration appointed by Presi
dent Sterling, the AWS president, and the
chairman ot Rally Committee. In the spring
quarter this group would select eight candi
dates for the four assistant yell leader posi
tions. These would be voted on at the regular
spring elections.
The following winter quarter, these four men
would be eligible to run for head yell leader
at a special winter quarter election. The new
head yell leader would then sit on the com
mittee nominating candidates for his assistants,
and would serve until the end of the following
winter quarter.
Plan Three
Plan Three, favored by several important
members of Cardinals, differs from Number
Two in a pair of points.

The head yell leader would be elected from
the assistants at the regular spring quarter
election.
Following the election, the new head yell
leader would convene with the rest of the
Nominating Committee to appoint his four as
sistants.
Plan Four
Plan Four, proposed by the Daily, differs
only slightly from Plan Three. Under this pro
posal, the four incumbent assistant yell leaders
would automatically qualify for the primary
ballot in the head yell leader election.
The nominating committee would be em
powered to screen other men who wanted to
run for head yell leader, and to select a maxi
mum of four more candidates for the primary
ballot.
(Comparison
Under each plan, write-in candidates would
be permitted.
Under each of the proposals for revision, the
makeup of the nominating committee would
be revised in the same manner, i.e., its mem
bership would be as outlined under Plan Two.
The administration member would not run
the committee, but merely add an opinion in
selecting a man for whose actions it bears most
of the responsibility.
The purpose of the change in makeup of
the committee is to give it a broader base in
the student electorate.
The intent of all the proposals for revision
is to provide experienced candidates for head
yell leader.
In addition, Plan Two provides a popular
election for assistant yell leaders.
The drawbacks of this proposal are twoâ€”it
adds a cumbersome winter quarter election,
and it fails to give the head yell leader much
of a voice in the selection of his assistants. We
believe the latter is most necessary if the yell
leaders are to work as a team.
Plan Three does away with the drawbacks
of Plan Two, but it still virtually restricts the
candidates for head yell leader to the incum
bent assistants.
Plan Four includes all the advantages of
Plan Three, but it removes the restriction on
head yell leader candidates that Plan Three
includes.
Therefore, we sincerely believe that Plan
Four is the best balance between democracy
and workability that is available for considera
tion, and that it should be adopted by Excom
tonight.
