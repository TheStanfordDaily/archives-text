# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
(Since this is Travel Week at Stanford, we think
i{ apt tiÂ» reprint an item we did while in Helsinki
last summer.)
We went out to Otiniemi the other day. Otiniemi
is the pine-infested Olympic training camp of the
Iron Curtain countries. Visiting hours for the press
are restricted from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. And the min
ute a molder of public opinion arrives at the guarded

Commie athletic camp, a guide is
slapped on him, and the reporter
is shown only the places the Rus
sians want shown.
Now I am not all in favor of
guided tours, especially around
places that drip with intrigue,
uch as the Russian camp. And
so I sent my "guide," who looked
like a bad man in a Class B
movie, on an errand.
"Comrade," I lied, "I should

he very interested in seeing the box score of the
ITtisslan basketball game against Bulgaria. Please
fetch it for me."
With a gullible nod of his Russian head, my Rus
sian guide went his Russian way.
When he was out of gunshot (a figure of speech), I
made my surreptitious way toward the Russian living
quarters, taboo territory for American journalists.
Putting on a Bulgarian press badge (Bulgaria is an
Iron Curtain country) which I had gotten a hold of,
I casually walked past the Russian guard with a
nervous whistle on my lips and my heart beating

triple time.
1 peered around the first two floors and saw noth
ing interesting. Then I went up to the third floor and
chanced into the Russian reading room. As there was
no one around, I picked up some literature lying
on the table. Everything was in Russian, except one
magazine,, which was called "People's China." This
was in English and not altogether flattering to those
of us who claim the Stars and Stripes:
"By the deliberate dispersion of Hies and other
insects artificially infected with bacteria . . , , a
most grave and horrible crime has been perpetrated
by U.S. forces in Korea. By the ill-treatment and
torture of civilian inhabitants . . . , the U.S. forces
have again broken the express provisions of the
Hague Regulations."
I looked out the window and saw that my guide
had returned. Not having lound me, he had contacted
several other gentlemen, all of whom were frantically
racing around, presumably to find me. Not wanting
to play in a sequel to a Keystone Cops drama, I
slipped out of the Russian dormitory and into the
spacious dining hall.
In the front of the room was a mammoth picture
of Stalin, and strung all around the walls were por
traits of each member of the Politburo. At this point
my panting guide found me. I allowed as how I was
looking all over for him, and I thanked him heartily
for the box score on the Russian-Bulgarian basketball
game.
Don't tell Senator McCarthy, but I enjoyed my left
wingish day.
