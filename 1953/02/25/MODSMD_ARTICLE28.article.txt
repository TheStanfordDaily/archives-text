NON-SIGNERS RETUKN — Four
of the l'aculty members who were
dismissed from the University of
California in August, 1950, for re
fusing to sign the Board of Regents'
loyalty declaration were back on
the Berkeley campus last week. The
four are the first of 19 non-signers
planning to return.
The question of back salaries for
the period of their dismissal is still
unsettled. The Board of Regents
last week voted to send the ques
tion of back pay to the State Su
preme Court, which recently de
clared the oath unconstitutional and
ordered the Regents to rehire any
non-signer who wished to return.

HAVE A DRINK? Free cocktails
are being served to students at the
beginning of psychology lectures at
Bristol University, England. Acting
as "barman" is the professor him
self, who wants to use his students
in an experiment on the effect of
small doses of alcohol on dexterity
and reaction aptitude.

FOOLPROOF? The "Michigan
Daily" reports the invention of a
new alarm clock guaranteed to
wake the stubbornest sleeper, and
—what's more—to keep him awake.
The clock works by a photo-elec
tric beam which shoots across your
bed so that it is interrupted by
your body. When the alarm bell is
tripped, the clock rings until you
jump up and let the light beam
through. If you try to sneak back
into bed, you break the beam again
and the alarm resumes its din.
P.S. —You can't unlock the casing
to shut it off for an hour. And pull
ing the plug won't work either, be

cause it's screwed into the socket
permanently.

SOUR G RAPES. The Cornell
University junior class, undaunted
by the faculty's ban of its scheduled
eggnog party, is trying again. This
time it'll be a "sour grape" party,
featuring whiskey sours and grape
punch. There's more than one way
to peel a grape . . .

PHYSICAL EDUCATION —USC
students are asking who was the
professor who introduced a new and
virile note to his classess at the end
of the first session of the new se
mester. After collecting admission
cards and learning that there were
no questions, he said "Goodbye."
Then, as students stared in amaze
ment, he vaulted out the open win
dow.
Stanford figures in another Tro
jan mystery — the umpteenth theft
of Tommy Trojan's sword. Tommy's
weapon was replaced from the stock
the university keeps on hand, but
officials still suspect Stanford stu
dents who were in town last week
end for the basketball game.
