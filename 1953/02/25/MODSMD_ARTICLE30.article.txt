# Card Wrestlers, Boxers Face Bears
## Grapplers Hope To Upset Cal 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
It's five and five with one to go,
and the Card grunt-and-groaners
don't plan to let the big bad Bear
stand in the way of a winning sea
son.
The Card wrestlers take on the
favored Boars tonight at 7:.'10 in
Enrina (Jym in what should shape
up to he the meet of the year.
Admission is free, and bleachers
will he set up to take care of the
crowd.
The -Cards lost to the Bears in
their first meet of the season on a
typical Cal luck-through. Half an
hour before the team left for
Berkeley, Phil Wilson, Bruce Bai
ley, and Steve Gee were declared
ineligible for technical reasons and
there was no one to replace them.
Fifteen points of forfeits was too
much to overcome, and what could
have been a great season got off on
the w/ong foot.
The Stanfords then proceeded to
lose two to San Jose State, drop one
to an extremely fine Oregon State
outfit, and one to a strong San Die
go State team. As it shaped out, it
will probably be between San Jose,
San Diego, and OSC for the PCI
crown.
In midseason Coach Don Wil
liam ' boys finally found their form,
dropping San Franchco State twice,
Alameda NAS twice, and San Quen
tin once.
Key men of the Card forces are
(ieoiyfe Russell at 1157 and Jack
Ogelshy at I<»7. Russell has only
gone in eight matches this sea
son. and has five pins, two deci
sions, and one draw. The scrappy
little junior was last year's PCI
champion, and will he favored to
take the title again if his bruised
rili heals in time.
"Smiling" Jack Ogelsby is team
captain and has a seven-and-two
record. The perennial crowd pleas-

cr started slow, losing two out of
his first three, and then dropped to
second string behind Bob Beatie.
By mid-season he found his form
and returned to take his last six
matches, five of them by pins.
The 177 division will see either
Pat Madden or Bob Beatie tackle
Cal's A 1 Schorkcr. Madden has
been away and hasn't been train
ing. while Beatie has been injured
and hasn't been training.
'l'he two toughest assignments will
probably go to little Steve Gee at
123 and Jim Hutchinson at 13U. Gee
faces Bill Perry, a veteran from last
year's powerful team, while
"Hutch-babe," riding high on two
straight pins, takes on veteran Jul
ian Sanders.
Russell takes on another tough
assignment in Bob Rugg, the boy
who gave him a run for his money
in last year's PCI finals.
Bruce Bailey, the "battling bar
rister," will match the muscles he
developed carrying five-pound law
books with Joe Cooke at 147.
At 157, Ken James will be out to
even an old score with Grady West,
his victor by a decision earlier in
the season.
Ogelsby will try to handle Bob
Learner from his 1(»7 spot, while
Al ( ollnn, the guts performer who
barely tips the scales at 18(1 soak
ing wet, will hold down the
heavyweight class against C'al's
Kay Mosten.
