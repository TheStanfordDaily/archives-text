# Boxers Out To Avenge Bear Win
## 
### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
The Stanford boxing team, still
looking for that elusive first win of
the sea.son, journeys across the Buy
to take on California.
The pugilists have been plagued
by defaults all season, and tonight
will be no exception as they are
lorfeiting the 155-lb. and 1455-lb. di
visions. The last time they fought
Cal, about a month ago, the team
actually won a majority of the bouts
fought, but lost the match 4 1 /2-3'/2
because of two forfeits.
Bob Baldocchi, who possesses a
remarkable college record, will be
going after his eighth straight win.
Norm Manoogian, who recorded
his second knockout of the season
last time out, may again be boxing
Don Wilson, whom he floored in 50
seconds of the first round of his first
fight. If Wilson doesn't quite feel
up to the ta.sk of trading punches
again with the powerful Manoogian,
Dick West will take his place.
Gary Sievert, 133 lb., who has
bumped into the toughest of oppo
sition all season, once again faces
the big task of holding off PCC
champ Ken Hansen. In their first
match this season, Gary gave the
Cal boxer a good battle, but dropped
a split decision.
Fred Dittmer, who won his first
college fight last time against S.F.
Slate, will face Hansen's brother,
Myron.
At 145, Jack Owens, who has
really come along this season, will
be fighting Jack Slaybaugh.
Romeo Formentini, little man on
the team at 125 lb., will be trying
to avenge his early-season loss to
Phil Ishimaru.
Coach Ray Lunny has good rea
son for having the fight away from
home. He says that "Every good
punch we land will be heard a mile
away, while the slightest glancing
blow by Cal will be drowned out
by the noisy crowd."

Norm Manoogian, who recorded
his second knockout of the season
last time out, may again be boxing
Don Wilson, whom he floored in 50
seconds of the first round of his first
fight. If Wilson doesn't quite feel
up to the ta.sk of trading punches
again with the powerful Manoogian,
Dick West will take his place.
Gary Sievert, 133 lb., who has
bumped into the toughest of oppo
sition all season, once again faces
the big task of holding off PCC
champ Ken Hansen. In their first
match this season, Gary gave the
Cal boxer a good battle, but dropped
a split decision.
Fred Dittmer, who won his first
college fight last time against S.F.
Slate, will face Hansen's brother,
Myron.
At 145, Jack Owens, who has
really come along this season, will
be fighting Jack Slaybaugh.
Romeo Formentini, little man on
the team at 125 lb., will be trying
to avenge his early-season loss to
Phil Ishimaru.
Coach Ray Lunny has good rea
son for having the fight away from
home. He says that "Every good
punch we land will be heard a mile
away, while the slightest glancing
blow by Cal will be drowned out
by the noisy crowd."

The Stanford boxing team, still
looking for that elusive first win of
the sea.son, journeys across the Buy
to take on California.
The pugilists have been plagued
by defaults all season, and tonight
will be no exception as they are
lorfeiting the 155-lb. and 1455-lb. di
visions. The last time they fought
Cal, about a month ago, the team
actually won a majority of the bouts
fought, but lost the match 4 1 /2-3'/2
because of two forfeits.
Bob Baldocchi, who possesses a
remarkable college record, will be
going after his eighth straight win.
Norm Manoogian, who recorded
his second knockout of the season
