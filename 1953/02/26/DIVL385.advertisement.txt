The Story of a BARCAIN •
There are glamorous sisters now at Stanford whose father was a ZETF: bjck in the early thirties
—and I was sending six of them to Europe.
Third class round-trip passage on the SS WASHINGTON cost $142.00
while on the SS HARDING it cost 1 36.00
I tried very hard to get them to take the WASHINGTON—a larger ship, better facilities, and
opportunities for much more fun.
But they though hard, "Six bucks is six bucks—s x 6 = $36.00, and that'll buy a lot of ham
sandwiches." So being smart lads, they took the cheapest bargain.
The following September they dropped in to thank their Travel Accnt ronortirvi "A WONDER
FUL summer, and thanks a million for everything."
"How did you like your ship?" I asked.
"Oh it was alright, but we realized we should have taken your adv'icm . . . We didn't
know the difference, you did ... it wasn't worth the savins."
This could happen to you. Studv our bargain, examine the merits of each offer, find out exactly
WHAT vou are buying, what you are getting.
