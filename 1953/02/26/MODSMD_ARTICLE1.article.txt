who sang, spilled, and splashed their way through an hour of
serving dinner.

—Richard Balch, Bob Ghilotti, Wil
liam Bark, Clark Oglesby, and Bob

Their "work" was interrupted at
frequent points in the dinner when
they stopped to sing to the diners.
The five were rewarded at the end I
oi the dinner when Lathrop showed
their appreciation for the singing
and/or hashing by taking them to
dinner at Dinah's Shack.
Ventura reported an equal
amount of color—much of it sup
plied by bath towels which the
girls had draped over their heads
in anticipation of being served
soup by the faculty hashers. Two
of the Ventura girls huddled under
a striped beach towel.
The five Ventura hashers—Dean H.
Donald Winbigler, Rev. Robert
Minto, Henry Blauth, David Harris,
and Norman Graebner—were greeted
by a spontaneous song as they

quipped to Rev. Minto, "Reverend,
do you remember this service?"
The five Ventura hashers were re
warded with the singing of "For He's
a Jolly Good Fellow," in addition to
a one-cent tip left by each diner.
