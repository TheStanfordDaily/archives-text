# Yell Leader Controversy Ends; Daily Plan' Adopted
## 
### HADLEY ROFF Associate Editor, The Daily 
The four-week debate and argument over the yell leader propo
sition ended last night when Student Body President Dick Weis
mann broke a 7 to 7 deadlock and threw his support behind the
so-called Daily plan of yell leader selection.
The final vote on the long controversy came after two and a

half hours of heated debate in
which Daily Editor James Madison
and Cardinals President Roy Alex
ander clashed on several points.
Alexander introduced the Cardi
nals proposal for changes in the
yell leader selection procedure at
the outset of the meeting, and Mad
ison, following a scheme advocated
by him in an editorial in yesterday's
Daily, offered amendments.
It was a radically amended ver
sion of the Cardinals proposal that
finally became a lasting by - law
change last night.
Madison, pressing for adoption of
his editorial plan, called for the ap
pointment of four assistant yell
leaders each year by a special nom
inating board. These four would be
eligible the next year to run for
head yell leader.
Madison further urged that the
nominating board be given the ad
ditional power to select a maximum
of four other students, outside the
freshman class, to compete with the
assistants for the head yell leader
ship during the spring elections.
In defending his proposal, Madi
son said he thought his system pro
vided a wider base of representa
tion and offered an opportunity for
more democratic procedure.
The new plan also calls for the
election of the head leaders at the
spring election, with the successful
candidate taking office as soon as
results are known.
The winning <*indidate will then
sit on the special nominating board
to screen assistant applicants. That
board will consist of the student
body president and vice-president,
the AWS president, and a faculty
representative, as well as the new
head yell king.
The Cardinals proposal, as intro
duced by Alexander, called for the
election of the assistants from a
list of six nominees named by the
nominating committee. The propo
sal also called for the election of
the head leader during winter quar
ter, a disadvantageous time accord
ing to Madison and spokesmen for
the Election Committee.
The Cardinals plan had only scant
provision for the nomination of
head leader candidates outside the
ranks of the assistants.
