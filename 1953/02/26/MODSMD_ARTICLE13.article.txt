# Templeton To Give Concert On Saturday
## 
### 
Alec Templeton, noted pianist,
radio, and recording star, will pre
sent a concert at Stanford Saturday
for the benefit of the Free Univer
sity of Berlin.
The concert will be held at 8:15
p.m. in Memorial Hall, under the
joint auspic#*; of the Associated
Students of Stanford University and
the Institute of International Rela
tions, an organization of Stanford
students interested in international
affairs.
Templeton has assembled a pro
gram including both piano classics
and his own improvisations. Among
the compositions to be heard are
"Pavanne to the Earl of Salisbury"
by William Byrd; "Sonata in B Flat
Major," by Mozart; and "Arabesque
No. 1" by Debussy.
Born with absolute pitch, Temple
ton has developed his remarkably
accurate ear so that today he can
play through a new piece, regard
less of its length or difficulty, after
only one hearing.
Tickets for the benefit are avail
able at the Peninsula Box Office in
Palo Alto and the Concert Series
box office in the Stanford Union.
Prices are $1, $1.75, and $2.
