(I'ditiii's note: The following is
the second of two articles telling
the story of the Spring Quarter
Blood Drive. Yesterday's story
told about how Ken Scheehter, now
ehajrman of the drive, was wound
ed in Korea and was "talked in"
for a landing by his buddy in an
other plane. Today's tells how he
came to Stanford and got the idea
for the mammoth drive.)
Five thousand pints of blood.
Sounds like a close-to-impos
sible goal for a Stanford Blood
Drive, doesn't it? It did to Ex
com when Ken Schechter first
told them about the plans he had
for the Spring Quarter Blood
Drive.
But. ho convinced them that Stan
ford can give that much. .lust as he
has convinced those who have met
him and worked with him since.
Ken got the idea for the drive last
fall. After being wounded in Korea,
he spent six months in several hos
pitals. then entered Stanford last
S ;>ti mber. He already had a couple
of years at UCLA (he's from Los
An el ) before he joined the Navy,
so he entered as a junior.
Ken. joined Public Relations
Committee and one day I'ub Rel

Chairman Nancy Clark phoned
and asked if he'd help the Student
Health Committee publicize their
fall quarter blood drive. It was
Ken's idea to bring 1 the men from
Oak Knoll Hospital to speak in
campus living groups.
Though the drive was the most
successful ever held at Stanford, Ken
still wasn't satisfied. He remembered
how, when he was overseas, he would
read that the Red Cross had asked
for amounts like 75,000 pints of blood
and had only received 15,000. And
he decided something had to be done.
He sat down and prepared a 20-
page report on plans for a drive that
would make headlines and perhaps
inspire the "if Stanford can do it, so
can we" feeling in universities all
over the country.
The 5,000-pint goal was set on
the reasoning that more than 7.00 ft
students plus university staff plus
both groups' wives would give
plenty of people to draw on.
Ken and the more than 75 people
on his committee have worked for
weeks on arrangements to make
giving easy.
Parents' permission slips are now
being handed out, so they can be
taken home over spring vacation.
They're available in living groups
and at a table in front of the Cellar.
This time the permission informa
j tion is printed in business reply card
] form. It can either be mailed directly
1 to the Palo Alto Red Cross Chapter,

turned in to a living group blood
drive representative, or handed in
at the table that will be set up in
the Pavilion oh Reg Day.
Signups for the drive will be
held the second week of spring
quarter; the drive itself will last
through the (hird week. The Red
Cross is bringing in units from-all
over the Bay Area to be set up in
the Pavilion.
The plans are there. All that is
needed is the will to give and the
carry through.
Ken and his committee are confi
dent that Stanford will come through.
Ken thinks the students realize that
they're "damn lucky they're not out
getting shot at, too." And that
they'll realize, too, it will be their
friends and sweethearts and a lot
of other guys their own age they'll
be helping.
