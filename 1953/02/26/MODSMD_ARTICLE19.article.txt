# CAMPUS OPINION
## The
						Rosenberg Case 
### 
To the Editor:
I read with interest the Daily's account of David
Alman's Sunday speech on behalf of the Rosenbergs
The writer of the editorial commendably declines to
evaluate the speech, pleading insufficient knowledge
of the facts. An objectively written summary of the
evidence and arguments made by the Rosenberg
attorney can be found in the appellate courts opinion
in volume 195 of the Federal Reporter (second series)
at page 583. For those who don't have a law library
handy, I should like to attempt to point out some of
the weaknesses in the arguments made by Alman.
1. "New evidence has been found which proven
the innocence of the Rosenbergs." Fortunately, the
law recognizes new evidence as a ground for a new
trial, and if there is any merit to this claim the
Rosenbergs will, in due course, he granted one.
Meanwhile, public clamor, inspired by Alman-likc
speeches, will not swerve the courts an iota from
a dispassionate and intelligent evaluation of this
new evidence.
2. "The death penalty is too severe." Suffice to say
that there is no legal objection to the sentence, and
under sixty years of precedent, the sentence is not
reviewable on appeal.
3. "The Rosenbergs were denied a fair trial he
cause the trial judge and the jury were prejudiced."
Quoting from the Rosenberg's own attorney, iti his
address 'o the jury: "VVe feel that the trial has been
conducted with that dignity and that dccorum that
beflts aat American trial." The record is filled with
instance# the judge again and again t<>lrf the
jury he had no opinion on the case and, if they
thought he had an opinion, they should utterly dis
regard it.
In view of the fact that a federal trial judge has
the right to comment directly on the evidence, I
should say that the judge took special and unneces
sary pains to keep his own views out of the case.
As to the supposed prejudice of the jury, if this
argument had any merit, it would have been raised
on appeal.
4. "The Rosenbergs should not have been con
victed because, at the time of the criminal acts,
Russia was an ally." They would have been equally
guilty had they sent the information to England.
Long before the Rosenberg case came up, another
court had interpreted the Espionage Act as follows:
"This section (of the Espionage Act) as enacted neces
sarily implies that there are some kinds of informa
tion relating to the national defense' which must

not be given to a friendly power, not even to an ally,
no matter how innocent, or even commendable, the
purpose of the sender may be."
T>. "The Rosenbergs should not have been con
victed because the government's case was based
largely on the testimony of accomplices." Countless
people have been convicted on the testimony of ae
compl?ces, murderers, rapists and other persons of
unsavory character. It was known to the jury that
these witnesses were accomplices and they were*
instructed by the court to w<?igh their testimony
with the utmost care and caution.
But the jury is the solo test of credibility under
our system of law; if they decide that they believe
someone, that finding is final. The only question on
appeal is whether the evidence, if believed, is suffi
cient to sustain the verdict. There can hardly be anv
argument with the appellate court's finding on this
noint.
(.. "Trie Rosenbergs are victims of anti-semitism. v
This argument must be particularly irksome to the
trial judge and prosecutor, who were also Jewish.
In short, the Rosenbergs got exactly the same kind
of treatment from our judicial processes that everyone
else has been getting for the past one hundred and
seventy-five years.
