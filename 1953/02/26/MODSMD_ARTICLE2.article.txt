# Row Burglar Hits Two More Houses
## 
### 
A combined total of $99 was sto
len from the Alpha Delt and Phi
Kap houses early Tuesday morning
in a continuation of what Police
Chief Gordy Davis describes as "too
long a series of Row burglaries."
The Alpha Delt house was robbed
of $82 and the Phi Kaps lost $17.
All of the loss was in cash, taken
from the wallets of the house resi
dents as they slept. Heaviest loser
in the twin robbery was Alpha Delt
Will Clayton, who reported $80 sto
len from his wallet.
Davis said the burglaries occurred
between 2 and 3 Tuesday morning
and that no one in either house re
ported having seen any suspicious
prowler during the night. The ac
tual losses were not discovered until
late in the afternoon.
The early-morning Row burgla
ries, Davis has said, have been more
frequent this year than for many
previous years.
"The fellows in the houses are
going to have to tighten up their
living arrangement unless they
want more of the same robberies,"
Davis warned.
