To the Editor:
Your article "Slick Talker ..." -and editorial
"What Does It Moan?" were really exceptional—
may I congratulate you on a good piece of writing!
Although the reduction in the number and length of
editorials after D. Dodge left the office of Editor was
noticeable, the quality ol an editorial such as "What
Does It Mean" more than makes up for any defi
ciency that I felt existed up to this time. Keep up
the good work!
Incidentally, the action that you suggest on the
Red Question .seems to me a little stronger
than is necessary at this time. I feel certain that
the Red Cross will carefully consider any criticism or
suggestions that are brought to their attention—in
my opinion, a suggestion that the problem should be
brought before the Red Cross Board of Directors
would have been more in order than the drastic
action that you suggest.
