# Coffee, Doughnuts, and Education Mix
## 
### JANE LINDEMUTH 
Education is going to i kaffee
klatsch. And what's coming out
of it? Better education.
Over coffee and doughnuts in
Education Building's • third-floor
social room. Education Council
members meet each Thursday
noon to iron out functional dif- j
ficulties and to promote better
faculty-student relations within
the School of Education.
Though coffee is perhaps the least
important of the items offered Edu- |
cation School members by the Ed j
Council, proceeds from this conces
sion make possible many of the
Council's further functions—such as
providing typewriters, duplicating
machines, and pencil sharpeners for
student use.
Included in benefits offered by the
Council is the bringing together of
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents in a common project: (1) to
serve as a liaison body between stu
dents and faculty, (2) to aid in pro
curement of class materials, and (3)
to assist in improving classes.
"To my knowledge, Stanford is
the only university providing an
organization where graduate and
undergraduate students of educa
tion can meet together to solve
mutual problems" says Acting
Dean I. James Quillen, School of
Education professor.
"Guiding hand" behind the or
ganization, Dr. Quillen came to
Stanford in 1936. Official of the
UNESCO Secretariat in Paris in
1948 and 1949, where he was in
charge of projects on the improve
ment of textbooks and teaching ma
terials, Dr. Quillen also served as
acting head of the UNESCO De
partment of Education, and assisted |
in the organization of UNESCO as
a member of the Liaison Committee )
on International Education and the
International Educational Assembly
lrom 1943 to 1945.
Winter quarter officers directing
the Council's activities include:
Jim lams, president; Nancy Rice,
vice - president; Elouise Conte,
secretary; and Jack Murphy,
treasurer.
Each Council member represents
one class in the .Education School.
After Council meetings, representa
tives report back to the instructor
and the class — thus providing for
direct discussion of problems by

class memberships.
Social activities sponsored by the
Council center around a social room
provided by the late Dr. Elwood P.
Cubberley, Ed School's beloved
"Dad."
A television set, available for use
by the student body, Is one center
of attraction. Overflow crowds ap
peared to view the recent Presiden
tial inauguration program. Plans
are now under way for redecora
tion of the room and purchase of a
television stand.
A series of lecturcs is being
planned to give students an op
portunity to hear visiting profes
sors and members of the faculty
whose classes they may be un
able to attend. Lectures are to be
followed by a discussion-refresh
ment period, giving students a
chance to meet the faculty infor
mally.
"Suggestions are welcomed by
our council," President lams as
sures interested students. "Our so
cial room is open to everyone from
10 a.m. until 4 p.m. and from 7
until 10 pjn. daily." Often as not,
lams concludes his talk with, "Won't
you have a cup of coffee?"
