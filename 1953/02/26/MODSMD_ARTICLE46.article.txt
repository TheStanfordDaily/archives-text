### EDA MENDELS 
Beside innumerable textbooks
the Stanford Bookstore has a
large selection of popular read
ing matter. Between the jewel
ry counter and the office are
nine browsing tables where stu
dents can find books of every
description.
The humor table is probably the
most popular one. Featured there
now are the cartoon books "King
Aroo," by Jack Kent; '"Ladies and
Gentlemen," by Peter Arno; and
two volumes about that popular
Presidential candidate, "Pogo," by
Walt Kelly.
Students who are interested in
the forthcoming British coronation
may enjoy "The Crown Jewels,"
which includes a description of the
coronation services and color illus
trations. It is one of the King Pen
guin Books, all of which cost less
than a dollar.
Several shelves are stacked
with Modern Library books, $1.25

editions of famous books of nearly
every period and country. Their
authors include Spinoza, Ogden
Nash, Dickens, Cicero, Victor
Hugo, O. Henry, Chekov, Goethe,
and Benjamin Franklin.
The two late non-fiction tables
display books for nearly every in
terest. There lies, among others,
"Science Is a Sacred Cow," by a
professional chemist who studied at
MIT, Anthony Standen. "My Uncle
Joseph Stalin," which the jacket de
scribes as "an intimate portrait by
his nephew Budu Svanidze," is
there, too.
The native Californian, as well as
the foreign student or out-of-stater,
may be interested in the selection
offered on the "California and the
West" table. A Stanford University
Press publication, the richly illus
trated "Mother Lode Album," is a
major attraction.
Sea stories are well represented
on the fiction table by "Caine Mu
tiny" by Herman Wouk, "The Old
Man and the Sea" by Hemingway,
and"The Cruel Sea" by Nicholas
Monsarrat.
