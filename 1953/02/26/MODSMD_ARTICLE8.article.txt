# S.F. Welcomes Van Fleet
## 
### HADLEY ROFF Associate Editor, The Daily 
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 25—
General James A. Van Fleet, re
tired Eighth Army commander,
arrived here today on the first
leg of a journey that will carry
him to Washington and a round
of Senate and House investiga
tions on the conduct of the Ko
rean war.
Not that Van Fleet's prosecution of
the combat is questioned, for it is
not, judging by the tumultuous wel
come he received when he stepped
ashore from the Navy Transport
President Jackson shortly after 9 a.m.
yesterday.
It's the war orders that stemmed
from the White Hou.se during the
reign of Harry S. Truman that are
under fire.
As Van Fleet, who for 22 months
was senior field commander in
Korea, pointed- out during his
speech and a subsequent press
conference yesterday afternoon,
"I am only a field commander, and
I follow orders."
The general, his tunic splashed
with service and campaign ribbons,
said little, very little of the Korean
war, and during the press confer
ence stoutly refused to comment on
any plans for ending the stalemate.
Speaking at a civic luncheon held
in the crystal and gold Palace Hotel
dinfng room, Van Fleet praised "my"
Eighth Army, saying it is the "most
powerful and courageous army ever
assembled."
He had particular praise for the
infantrymen, "the mud and fox
hole soldiers," as he called them.
At the conclusion of his speech,
Van Fleet dramatically hoisted his
water glass and proposed a toast "to
our greatest president — General
Dwight Eisenhower." The more than
500 people at the luncheon, includ
ing many of the star-speckled brass
of the army and navy, stood in trib
ute to the new President.
At the press conference, the gen
eral, a dew of sweat noticeable on
his brow, his mouth set in a tight,
determined line, shook ofl most
queries about the conduct of the
dragging Asian conflict.
He answered many questions

with a crisp "No comment" or "It's
none of my business." lie snap
pishly rciuvcd to comment on
whether the United States should
press a gt eral offensive now,,
whether the United States should
employ the atomic bomb, or
whether the United States should
seek Nationalist Chinese help in
Korea.
The general, in n guarded pre
pared statement, did say he thought
a step-up in offensive action could
break the deadlock.
A suggestion of bitterness crept

into the ex-battle commander's voice
when asked if it were true that he
couldn't deploy forces above bat
talion strength without express per
mission from Washington or Tokyo.
"That's confidential," he said, his
eyes fastened on his twisting
hands. '
Van Fleet will remain in San Fran
cisco until Friday, when he will fly
to Los Angeles where another gala
welcome is planned. From there he
will head for Washington and the
hearings.
