The Story of a BARGAIN
There are, glamorous sisters now at Stanford whose father was a ZFTE hark in the early thirties
—and I was sending six of ihem to Europe.
Third class round-trip passage on the SS WASHINGTON cost $142.00
while on the SS HARDINC it cost ' 36.00
I tried very hard to get them to take the WASHINGTON —a larger ship, better facilities, and
opportunities for much more fun.
But they though hard, "Six bucks is six bucks—6 x C —: $36.00, and that'll buy a lot of ham
sandwiches." So being smart lads, they took the cheapest bargain.
The following September they dropped in to thank their Travel Aupnt. rtinarl'ma "A WONDER
FUL ummer, and thanks a million for everything.'"
"How did you like your ship?" I asked.
"Oh it was alright, but we realized we should have taken your advic# . . . We didn't
Vnow the difference, you did ... it wasn't worth the savin« "
