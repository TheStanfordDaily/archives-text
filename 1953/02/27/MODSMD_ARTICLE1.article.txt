# Curds Out to Dethrone Bears
## 
### MIKE HUDSON Daily Sports Editor 
Stanford's cagers will end it
all this weekend as they host
and visit the red-hot Cal Bear
quintet. Tonight the two teams
clash in the Pavilion. Tomorrow
night they will meet in Berke
ley in a TV'd battle. Both games
start at 8.
It's been a lon#, tough season, but
basketball is one sport where the
Cards can truly say "Wait till next

year," for only two of the top ten
cagers close out their hardwood ca
reers against the Bears.
Saturday's tilt will be the final
showing of I'aul Johnson, the
spot - playing sharpshooter, and
captain George Zaninovich, the
hard-driving forward.
The Cards beat the Bears once
this season and they would like
nothing better than to do it again.
If they could top the Bears once,
while UCLA is beating USC twice,
the PCC race would be deadlocked.
Once again Stanford assumes its
perennial role of the spoiler.

Cal can field a smooth - as - silk
outfit. Experts split as to whether
the key to the Bears' class is Bob
Matheny or Bob McKcen. Matheny
is a diminutive play-maker and set
shot artist. He was chosen Northern
California player of the year.
The massive McKeen is a hook
shooting center who casts sel
dom, but still hits around 17
points a game. Coach Bob Bur
nett said he will not emulate
USC and UCLA in their attempts
to double-team McKeen. "We'll
play him honest. If he can beat
us single-handed, we'll let him.

The rest of Cal's team are so out
standing, we can't afTord to let
them roam free."
The rest of the Bear team, besides
Matheny, includes John and Rupc
Ricksen and Bob Albo. They arc
big boys who hit their ten points
cacli and provide Cal with tremen
dous power under the backboards.
It's terrifying to contemplate that
McKeen is only a sophomore, but
Stanford has its soph great too. Ron
Tomsie will make his final assault
of the year on the record-books. He
needs 21 points to become the first
Card eager to hit r>oo points. He

needs a more imposing 49 points to
top Bill Sharman's PCC scoring
â€¢mark of 238 points. Barring death
or draft, He'll have two more sea
sons to shoot at this record. Of
course, all three-year records arc
doomed to fall before this hard
driving sophomore.
Stanford's line-up besides Tom
sk- and Zaninovich will include
Russ Lawlcr, who will have the
unhappy task of guarding Mc-
Kccn; Don Del,ong, who bombed
17 points last Saturday night; and
Olie SuzdalelT, Stanford's answer
to Cal's Mathcny.
