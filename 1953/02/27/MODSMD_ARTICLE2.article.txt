MOSCOW, Feb. 26 (UP)—Foreign observers
believed today the Russians would welcome
President Eisenhower's willingness to discuss
peace face to face with Premier Josef Stalin.
Their best guess was that Berlin could be the
meeting place.

(Members of Congress eautioned
Mr. Eisenhower to demand tokens
of good faith, preferably in Korea,
before undertaking any meeting
with Stalin. A United Press Wash
ington dispatch said there were
strong suspicions that the Soviets
might use the idea as a propaganda
booby trap to divide the Western
coalition of free nations.)
The Soviet press did not publish
immediately Mr. Eisenhower's state
ment on a meeting with the Soviet
premier. It undoubtedly will get
closc and serious study, however.
Stalin lias proposed a meeting
with the United Stales President
several times in the last few
years. Mr. Eisenhower's statement
was cxpcctcd to receive favorable
reaction against the background
of former President Truman's re
fusal to travel outside the United
States for any such purpose.
Observers believed the likelihood
of a meeting was good now that
both men had expressed readiness
for one, although few ventured to
speculate on the outcome before
there was a preliminary agreement
on an agenda.
Observers pointed out that the
nomination of Charles Bohlcn to be
ambassador to Moscow and the
Kremlin's prompt acceptance might
be taken as a good omen.
Bohlcn could be useful in ar
ranging a meeting in view of his
participation in previous confer
ences with Stalin and his acquaint
ance with Stalin personally. In ad
dition, lie speaks Russian and is one
of America's leading Soviet experts.


JOSEF STALIN
—Can he be trusted?
