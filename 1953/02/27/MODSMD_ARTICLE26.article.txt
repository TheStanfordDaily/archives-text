# The 						Draft: A Positive Approach Pays Off
## 
### 
During the past two weeks the Daily has been
publishing a news item announcing thai "ap
pi ication blanks for the April 23 Selective Serv
icp lest are now available at the Men's Coiln
>v*iing Office. The deadline foj filing an appli
cation is March 9."
The Daily and the Chief Counselor for Men,
Richard L. Balch calculated that every male
student who has leached his eighteenth birth
day and/or been given a Selective Service
number since the test was last given in Decem
ber would drop into Balch's office to pick up
a it application blank.
But, to date, the response has been largely
apathetic. A surprising lack of interest has
also been shown in Mr. Balch's frequent
attempts in the past to make available the
latest, most accurate, and most useful in
formation about the service and the draft.
He has tried releases in the Daily; he has
uied releases through RA's in living groups.
But for one thing, over half the male student
body is not affiliated with any campus living
group. In the second place, most of the men
have either maintained a defeatist attitude, or
I -.ve v/orried fruitlessly over the service, and
In both instances have simply not bothered to
iind out what the score actually is.
Tco often a man takes no notice whatso
er of the draft until he walks into Mr. Balch's
office clutching one of the familiar form letters
saying, "You are hereby notified to report . . ."
What can be done tfien, in almost every case,
i nothing.
As long as Selective Service and not Uni
versal Military Training is the law of the land,
it :;eems impoitant to approach the draft test
■ id all other aspects of the draft with a posi
f:/e philosophy.
There i; : : no iron-clad assurance, but all down
l}. im* the chances lie in favor of a man who
follows this approach.
The chances for advantageously using the

period of military service improve consistently
with an advance in education.
These odds take a particular upsurge when a
man obtains his bachelor's or advanced degree,
for then there are a number of direct commis
sioning and enlisted specialty programs open.
It is definitely possible for any intelligent
and assiduous student to postpone his induc
tion via deferment until he graduates. There
need not exist a "don't give a damn" attitude
about this matter.
The chances, moreover, for deferment until
graduation improve if a student obtains a satis
factory score—7o will do in a pinch, 75 is bet
ter—on the Selective Service Qualification
Test.
The chances improve again if the student
also stands in the required upper portion of his
class—one-half for freshmen, two-thirds for
sophomores, and three-fourths for juniors.
'Hie granting of student deferments is still
optional with local draft boards, and they will
undoubtedly be guided by personal philoso
phy and their quotas, as well as by the criteria
outlined above.
However, the chances for successful ap
peals of lion-deferment classification are much
greater if a student meets both of these criteria.
Most men who are in a branch of the ROTC
have made it a habit to ignore the drafl test,
feeling secure in their deferment.
However, by no means all of the men in
elementary HOTC or Air EOTC are passed
into the advanced unit. When this dividing
point is leached, it will definitely help not
only to have adequate standing in the unit
and adequate class standing, but also a satis
factory score on the draft test.
In conclusion, we heartily recommend that
men students in general pay attention to future
news about the service and the draft, and that
18-year-olds in particular make application to
take the Selective Service Qualification Test
in April.

The chances for advantageously using the

period of military service improve consistently
with an advance in education.
These odds take a particular upsurge when a
man obtains his bachelor's or advanced degree,
for then there are a number of direct commis
sioning and enlisted specialty programs open.
It is definitely possible for any intelligent
and assiduous student to postpone his induc
tion via deferment until he graduates. There
need not exist a "don't give a damn" attitude
about this matter.
The chances, moreover, for deferment until
graduation improve if a student obtains a satis
factory score—7o will do in a pinch, 75 is bet
ter—on the Selective Service Qualification
Test.
The chances improve again if the student
also stands in the required upper portion of his
class—one-half for freshmen, two-thirds for
sophomores, and three-fourths for juniors.
'Hie granting of student deferments is still
optional with local draft boards, and they will
undoubtedly be guided by personal philoso
phy and their quotas, as well as by the criteria
outlined above.
However, the chances for successful ap
peals of lion-deferment classification are much
greater if a student meets both of these criteria.
Most men who are in a branch of the ROTC
have made it a habit to ignore the drafl test,
feeling secure in their deferment.
However, by no means all of the men in
elementary HOTC or Air EOTC are passed
into the advanced unit. When this dividing
point is leached, it will definitely help not
only to have adequate standing in the unit
and adequate class standing, but also a satis
factory score on the draft test.
In conclusion, we heartily recommend that
men students in general pay attention to future
news about the service and the draft, and that
18-year-olds in particular make application to
take the Selective Service Qualification Test
in April.

The Daily and the Chief Counselor for Men,
Richard L. Balch calculated that every male
student who has leached his eighteenth birth
day and/or been given a Selective Service
number since the test was last given in Decem
ber would drop into Balch's office to pick up
a it application blank.
But, to date, the response has been largely
apathetic. A surprising lack of interest has
also been shown in Mr. Balch's frequent
attempts in the past to make available the
latest, most accurate, and most useful in
formation about the service and the draft.
He has tried releases in the Daily; he has
uied releases through RA's in living groups.
But for one thing, over half the male student
body is not affiliated with any campus living
group. In the second place, most of the men
have either maintained a defeatist attitude, or
I -.ve v/orried fruitlessly over the service, and
In both instances have simply not bothered to
iind out what the score actually is.
