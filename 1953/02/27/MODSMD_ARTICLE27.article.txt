## More on the Rosenbergs 'Even a Negress?' 
### 
To the Editor:
It should not remain unsaid that your editorial
"hat Does It Mean?" on February 24 performed a
true service. I will say it now. Most of it was in-
U. mative, thought provoking, and without apparent
pi eiudice.
However, I should like to comment on the small
paragraph which deals with the attendance at the
meeting. To quote the Daily: "There were Jews,
Protestants, and Catholics. There was even a
Negress."
To me, tliis is reminiscent of such passages in
lurn&lism as "At the zoo last Sunday there were
elephants, monkeys, and leopards. There was even a
baby zebra."
The baby zebra is obviously an oddity. Does the
L''ii!y consider a Negress in the same way?
Pe»haps thi was merely an unhappy choice of
words but it does indicate the thought trend of the
d*\. As a Canadian, 1 would like to say that 1 can
not understand this trend. To me, Americans are a
people representing a great way of life, which I am
trying to observe and learn during my stay at
Stanford.
Hut to me, Negroes are part of the American people,
;ind ■ hould not be referred to as oddities.
