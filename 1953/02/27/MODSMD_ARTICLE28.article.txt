To the Editor:
Without taking any position on tlio merits of the

case, we wish to comment on the Rosenberg "article"
and "editorial" in the Daily of February 24—espe
cially on the Editor's concern that the Rosenberg
committee will "harass and delay the courts."
Statutes (which tlm Editor may find in (lie United
States Code, Title 28) prescribe the avenues and
extent of judicial appeals; they make no distinction
between "popular" and "unpopular" causes. If the
orderly prosecution of such appeals comes to be con
sidered as harassment of the courts, we will have
lost those ideal;: and concepts of justice fundamental
to a democratic nation.
We can't help but also comment on the Editor's
disregard of the distinction between objective re
porting and editorial comment- witness such phrases
as "slick talker" and "missionary appeal" in his
"news story." Despite the general tone of the Edi
tor's writings, even he concedes that those defending
the Rosenberg's may be "sincere and correct." Even
he grants that the people attending the Palo Alto
meeting were "reasonable looking." (Just what did
he expect?)
Many people have voiced the sentiment that death
is an unreasonable penalty, even assuming guilt.
Among them are Dr. Harold Urey, Albert Einstein,
the respected and conservative Rabbi Hillel Silver,
and the Pope—are they "reasonable looking"?

the Pope lias not voiced such a sentiment. He lias
merely transmitted appeals that have come to him.)
