## ON THE SLOPES 
### 
Dave Taylor, the bronzed, broad
shouldered psych grad student who
coaches the ski team, has been in
vited to compete in the Nationals on
March 12, 13, and 14.
This is a singular honor for Tay
lor, because only the 50 top racers
in the United Slates, Europe, and
other parts of the world are invited
to compete. He'll be skiing against
men like Norway's Stein Erickson,
winner of the Olympic slalom; Aus
tria's Christian Pravda, who placed
second; and Jack Reddish, captain
of the American Olympic team.
Until recently, Taylor was a skier
without skis. The schusser who won
about every race in sight last year
smashed two pairs, one by colliding
with an instructor at Edelweiss, and
didn't have enough money to buy
the expensive boards.
However, a friend in Berkeley
who has a ski shop gave Taylor a
pair of skis, and so he's all ready
for the Nationals.
The Stan ford-sponsored Tresidder

enth in the slalom, couldn't com
pete in the downhill because of a

Friday exam, and Denny Tuffanelli
couldn't be of full service because
of Med School commitments.
Last week, Collins placed 11th in
the downhill and tenth in the sla
lom and Wirth took a tenth in the
downhill, very good considering the
quality and quantity of competition.
