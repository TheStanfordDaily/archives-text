WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 (UP)—Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles, openly questioning
the good faith of Soviet rulers, said today Presi
dent Eisenhower has no present plans for a
meeting with Soviet Premier Josef Stalin.
Dulles went before the House Foreign Affairs
Committee to urge approval of Mr. Eisenhower's
resolution repudiating Russian violations of
World War II agreements such as the Yalta

Pact. He said the resolution is a
warning to Russia this country will
not submit to future violations.
lie said the only way to deal with
the Soviets is "on the barrelhead,"
making clear in advance that they
will have to live up to their prom
ised agreements. He suggested that
they be made to "perform first, for
once" and let the United States
'"carry out the promises."
Dulles was questioned closely
about Mr. Eisenhower's news con
ference remark yesterday that he
might be willing to go half-way to
a meeting with Stalin if it would
further chances of world peace.
Dulles said the President's state
ment "does not reflect existence of
any plan" for a meeting and that it
"is entirely in the realm of conjec
ture."
He also said the President delib
erately worded it in such a way as
to avoid controversy over the ac
tions of former Presidents Roosevelt
and Truman and the pacts they
made with the Russians. Democratic
Senators have hinted that they will
oppose the resolution if GOP law
makers amend it to do that.
Warning in cfYcct against («OP
efforts to "strengthen" it, Dulles
said the resolution is vital lo the
foundation of a bi-partisan for
eign policy. lie failed to sec how
it could be changed "to advan
tage."
"If it doesn't go through both
houses with virtual unanimity," he
said, "it will be worse than if it had
never been introduced."
