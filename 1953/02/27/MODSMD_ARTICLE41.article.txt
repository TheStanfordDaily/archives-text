# Russell Named 'Daily Athlete'
## 
### 
The Daily's second athlete of the
week award is given to George Rus
sell, Stanford's undefeated 137-
pound wrestler. He defeated Cal's
Jim Lieberman last Wednesday as
the grapplers took the Bears, 18-13.
This was the third time Stanford
has ever defeated Cal in wrestling.
Coach Don Williams credits
Russell with keeping the morale of
the team high through their early
matches. He has won all his
matches except one draw, despite
the fact that he has wrestled all
the year with a broken rib.
Russell, who comes from Tacoma,
has been wrestling for six years.
A Phi Delt, he wrestles for the fun
of it, and his current hope is that
his rib will allow him to wrestle in
the Pacific Coast Intercollegiates.
He trains by running up and down
the steps of the Stadium five times
a day.
This gutty junior has carried the
wrestling team to a winning sea
son and the Daily regrets that
space limitations don't allow a full
feature on Russell.
