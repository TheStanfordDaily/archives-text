# Gymnasts Meet Cal Tomorrow
## 
### DON STEPHENS 
For the first time in 20 years the
Stanford gymnasts should notch up
a Stanford - California Gymnastic
Big Meet victory when they face
the Cal muscle men tomorrow after
noon in the Encina Gym.
Cal is opening the season with
this meet and has a much weaker
team than last year's third place
Pacific Coast Conference >>quad.
Top men for the Bears will be John
Sachry in the side horse, rope climb,
and parallel bars, and Mark Har
rison in the trampoline, horizontal
bars, rings and tumbling events.
Team leader Jerry Nesselrod has
become one of the all-time best in
Indian gymnastic history, showing
his best in the recent San Jose State
meet, where he racked up 24 points,
less than half the team's total. Nes
selrod took three firsts and three
seconds.
In the San Jose meet the team
found an abundance of much-needed
depth, giving up only three firsts
and one third place.
John Gilmore has finally found the
form and is ready to score in the
tumbling and trampoline events.
Following the example of Nessel
rod and Gilmore, Gymnastic Coach
E. P. Hunt is expecting Dick Mart
land, Fred Schreiber, Ray Raguse,
Charles Scott, James Bauder, Ross
Presley and Jim Stevens to produce
some upset wins in the second and
third place brackets.
