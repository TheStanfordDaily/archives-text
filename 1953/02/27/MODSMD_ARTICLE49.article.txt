# Viewpoint to Print Three Lead Articles In First Anniversary Issue on Monday
## 
### SAM FRESHMAN Advertising Manager, The Daily 
Three lead articles, one by a professor, one by a student, and
one by a staff member, will be featured in Viewpoint's anniversary
issue to hit the stands on Monday. It was just a year ago that the
first Viewpoint was published.
A report from the University planning office on what ideas are

now being formulated for Stanford's"
future buildings and campus will
head the list of contents.
Articles including a discussion of
modern art by Professor Mendelo
witz and observations on denation
alization of the British steel indus
try by Alan Enthoven (a former
Stanford student now studying at
Oxford University on a Rhodes
scholarship) will be included.
The March 2 issue will have an
entirely new cover design replacing
the traditional partial table of con
tents of the last three issues. The
cover is being drawn by Stanforditc
Marilyn Rabinovich who has just
returned from studying at the Sor
bonne in Paris.
Many more poems and three
short stories, along with the mag
azine's regular features, will
round out the contents of the
winter quarter number.
Most of the fiction and all of the
poems are written by free lance
student authors who send their
manuscripts in without being mem
bers of the staff.
Any student .may send in articles,
stories, or poems for consideration.
The staff considers all manuscripts
and will return those that are ac
companied by adequate postage and
addresses. Only non-fiction articles
are solicited or assigned to staff
writers. The editors are always open
to suggestion for new lead articles.
Editor Tom Johnson says he's
ready and willing to consult with
students who wish to write for

Viewpoint. Manuscripts may be
sent to Box 2481. Stanford.
In less than a year Viewpoint
has traveled a long V vay toward
fulfilling its goal of being a gen
eral campus magazine reflecting
the attitudes and outlook of the
students on current problems. Its
columns have always been open to
both sides of an important contro
versy and standards have been
kept high.
Almost twice as many copies of
Viewpoint are printed and dis
tributed each quarter at Stanford
as are printed of any literary
magazine at a university of com
parable size.
The magazine's 13 staff members
include Business Manager Jack
Teeters and Art Editor Jim Stock
ton. Circulation and editorial as
sistants are Elizabeth Johnson, Bob
Gable, Nini Ramsey, Edith Cook,
Bob Kline, Nancy Stone, and Eliz
abeth Wiley, and Associate Editors
At Brouse and Charlotte Kempner.
Copies of the winter quarter issue
go on sale this coming Monday at
campus stands and will be available
at Congdon & Crome, Stanford Vil
lage Fountain, and the Cellar store.
A new subscription rate of three
issues for $1 has been announced by
the business office, and the old sub
scription rate of seven issues for $2
is still in force. Viewpoint is pub
lished once a quarter during the
regular school year.
