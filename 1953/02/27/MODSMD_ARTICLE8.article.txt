### 
A fro/.en hearing. A machinist's three frustrating hours over the
press. No Dailies.
This was the story yesterday morning when, for the first time in years,
outside of a dead week, professors in 8 o'clock ( lasses enjoyed a period
free of rattling papers, and campus hreakfasters went without their
usual early morning literature.
The Daily press hrokc downâ€”and only quick thinking hy the Daily's
pressman, I,en Walker, saved the Peninsula's only morning daily from
catastrophe. Walker and his assistant, Henry Jan/en, took the type
forms to Los Altos.
There, with the co-operation of Don Matchen's Los Altos News, the
Daily was printed on the News' press.
The Daily press stopped yesterday morning at 1 :IMI when a hearing
in one of the rollers froze, due to lack of lubrication. After the Uni
versity machinist spent three hours over it with no success. Walker went
to Los Altos.
The Daily press was repaired yesterday afternoon.
