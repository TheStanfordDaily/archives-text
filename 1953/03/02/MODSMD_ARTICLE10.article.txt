# Templeton's Piano Magic Thrills Fans
## 
### R. G. MANSFIELD 
He played it all—everything
from Bach to boogie woogie. He
put new life into Mozart's fami
liar embellishments, and then
he stomped his feet, pounded
the piano, and sang two-beat
compositions of his own.
Alec Tcmplcton practically had to
chase the people away after two
hours of amazing piano performance
Saturday night.
Templeton came here to give a
benefit concert for the Free Univer
sity of Berlin. Stanfordites filled Me
morial Auditorium to hear him, and
anyone who wasn't a Templeton fan
at the beginning of the evening had
been converted by the time the house
lights finally cut short the applause.
Templeton began li is program
with an original interpretation of
a Bach prelude, and two composi
tions by William By I'd, well-suited
to bis excellent light touch, and
closed the first part of his program
by showing the audience how
Handel might have improvised on
his own composition, "Largo."
After an intermission encore of
Rachmaninoff's "Prelude in C Sharp
Minor," Templeton began inter
spersing the classics with modern
rhythms, exhibiting his superb show
manship as he brought the audience
right into the act.
They sang along with him a
riotous honky-tonk tune which
said "I Want The Name, Age,
Height, Size of You!" They called
out five musical notes at random
and he improvised around these
notes in the styles of Bach, Chopin,
Liszt, Prokofiev, and, of course,
Templeton. And they gave him the
titles of four songs and he played
them all at once.
He burlesqued the modern inter
pretative baritone's hack version of
"Old Man River." He showed what
a modern jazz band might do to
Irving Berlin's "Marie," singing as
well as playing.
It might have been Jose Iturbi at
the piano playing Mozart. It migh*
have been Frankie Carle improvis
ing on "Sweet Lorraine." It might
have been Victor Borge treating
themes from Mignon to a swing bass.
But it could have been, and it was,
only one man, Alec Templeton, a
genius in terms of both musicianship
and showmanship.

It might have been Jose Iturbi at

only one man, Alec Templeton, a
genius in terms of both musicianship
and showmanship.
