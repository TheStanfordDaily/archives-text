# The 						Sun Fails to Care Is Lake Lag Opens
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Old timers couldn't recall a wi
many consecutive days of sunshi
the Farm for 38 straight days.
Senior Excom, sponsoring the c
in expectation of the throngs of st

nter in which there had been so
ine. The heavens had smiled on
jpening of Lake Lag, had drooled
udent humanity that would flock
to the lake on opening clay. The ex
com ordered tons of frosted soft
drinks and ice cream to take care
of the parched throats that would
result from the piercing sun and the
water activity.
Yesterday Lake Lag opened.
And for the first time in 38 days
it rained.
A /{roup of assorted well-wish
ci'i, attired in sweat sliirts, fiver
coats, and leather jackets, stood
shivering around the Alpha Delt
hand. The band blew frigid Dix
ieland notes over the grey,
murky, swimmerless waters of
Lake Lag and everyone stood
around agreeing, "Yes, it is a cold
day."
In the meantime, Dick Wcismann
was hiding in his barricaded room
in the Delt house. Wcismann was
supposed to christen Lag officially
for swimming purposes by being
thrown into the lake. Wcismann,
setting the example for his 7,000
Farm constituents, reneged.
Lag openings have had an un
blemished record of unsucccsscs
for the past three years. Two
years ago there was four inches
of snow on the foothills facing
the lake, the second time tins has
happened since the Winds of
Freedom lirst blew at Stanford.
The ice was too thin for ice
skating, however.
"Oh, well," as one senior said,
pulling his overcoat over his neck
and blowing his nose, "everyone
! talks about the weather, but no one
ever does anything about it."


AND THE BAND PLAYED ON —Despite threatening clouds which later broke down and cried,
many hardy students turned out for the opening of Lake Lag yesterday afternoon. Here they
are shown crowded around the Alpha Delt band which provided a musical salute for the occa
sion. The senior class was in charge of the program. . -- Daily photo by Jay Becker
