### RON ROSEN 
'
| A good-sized crowd filled Cubberley yesterday afternoon at the
11 Chamber Music Concert, which featured compositions by Darius
jjjjMilhaud, to help the famous French master celebrate his 60th
| birthday. This program, prepared under the direction of Sandoi
HSalgo, turned out to bo a notable musical event in every respect.

g All the works on the program had*
I something different and unusual t.n J
I! offer. The "Suite for Winds'" trio!
* written after the 17th century com
|! poser, Corette, was a happy svn-|
| i thesis of the old and the new The
| tuneful little melodies sang out
| beautifully in this unusual set t in;

of throe wind instruments. and were
helped alone; by the excellent pei ■
formances of George Houle, Muriel
Bermel, and Bruce Allen.
Although bothered slight y bv
the terrific harmonic difficulties of
the "Cantique du Rlvmc." Harold
Schmidt's hand-picked churn man
aged to surmount the problems of
pitch, and turned in a stylistically
and tonally fine performance.
Milhaud has managed to portray
the almost endless flow and myster
ious brooding of the river through
the use of a very unusual harmonic
structure. It is the type of work that
will continue to grow under repeated
hearings.
The "String Quartet" (No. 7 in B

♦
flat) which followed could easily be
said lo epitomize the best, of French j
style that is in Milhaud's chamber!
I music. The Quartet, along with all i
the works programmed, was not only i
brief, but concise in every detail, j
| The instrumentation, line, and form
i aimo t reminded one of Baroque i
implicity, and in many ways these I
works are much more effective than
Mil baud's larger orchestral compo
i sit ions.
Willi hi wife Madeleine doing the j
narration, Milhaud conducted the
:"( antate de L'Enfant et fie la Merc."
After the concert we asked M
I Milhaud exactly what he was trying
to do ; n his music in reference to
harmonic innovation and other musi
cal "discoveries.''
His answer was, "Music, simply
j mu ic." And this was no more in
evidence than in this unusual and
beautiful Cantate. which was given
a superb performance.

Hecordings of the Milhaud con
cert will he broadcast tonight a
,X over KZSI'.
