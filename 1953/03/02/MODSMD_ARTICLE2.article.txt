### 
NKVV YORKâ€”Robert A. Vogeler,
former prisoner of the Hungarian
Communists, said today the United
States should offer to spare the lives
of condemned atomic spies Julius
and Ethel Rosenberg in return for
the freedom of captive American
correspondent William Oatis.
He urged that Britain accept
Hungary's offer of trading his for
mer business colleague, Edgar San
ders, for a Communist girl sen
tenced to death in Malaya, and that
the United States "proceed on the
same basis 1o free Oatis" from a
Czechoslovakian jail by swapping
the Rosenbergs' lives.
