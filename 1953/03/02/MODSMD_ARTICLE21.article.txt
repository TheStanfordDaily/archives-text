# Union Planning: Open Hearings
## 
### 
The Union Planning Committee goes into the
home stretch this week in its campaign to
determine student not ds in the new Tresidder
Memorial Union.
In the past four weeks, the committee, led by
Jack Fraser has collected almost 6,000 com
pleted questionnaires from students alter in
terviews with 60 living groups.
This week the committee will hold public
hearings in Bowman Alumni House every after
noon.
At the close ot the campaign, the committee
will prepare a report to be used by the Univer
sity Director of Planning, Eldridge Spencer, as
a basis for design of the Tresidder Union.
The purpose of the hearings is threefold:
One They Will serve as a forum where off
campus students, who have not had the time or
opportunity to attend living group meetings,
will have a chance to air their desires.
Two They will give additional time to stu

dents who did not have the space to express
themselves sufficiently on the questionnaires.
Threeâ€”They v/ill provide an opportunity for
representatives of important faculty groups
which have an interest in the new union to ex
press their viewpoints.
Each person who signs up in the ASSU office
will be able to present his views and discuss
them with members of the Planning Committee.
Although the open hearing is very customary
in governmental organization, this is the first
time an ASSU committee has ever attempted it.
A notable innovation!
We think the hearings will be most worth
while, both to attend and to speak at.
It will be up to the several members of the
student body as well as the members of the
Union Planning Committee, if the design of the
Tresidder Memorial is to profit from the meet
ings.
