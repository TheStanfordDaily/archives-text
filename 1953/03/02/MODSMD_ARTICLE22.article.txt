# It's a Great Feeling
## 
### 
We were talking to some friends the other
night about giving blood in the spring guarter
drive. We discussed some of the bother in
volved, and then one of then) said:
"But it's worth it for the psychological reac
tion afterwards. You feel great!"
It's this feeling that makes us think 5,000
pints is a possible quota for the spring quarter
drive.
It's the feeling that when you give, you know
you're helping to fill a viial need—that you're
supplying the blood to save someone's life.
. . . The feeling that one of those soldiers
whose life you're saving is a guy your own age
. . . a guy like the ones who lived down the
block in your hometown . . . like the ones
you went to high school with.
. . . The feeling of pride in helping prove

that college students can do more than build
homecoming floats and hold panty raids . . .
of pride in helping show other Universities
what Stanford can do when it puts its collective
mind to it.
If you're a minor you can get a parents' per
mission card now. Take it home to be signed
over spring vacation. The cards are available
in your living group or at a table in front of the
Cellar.
Giving blood is painless and harmless, the
blood is soon replaced by your own body pro
cesses.
So if you're a minor, get your permission
card now. Whatever your age plan to sign up
the second week of next quarter. And calendar
the third week of Ihe guarter to give blood.
What will you be doing then that's more
important than saving a life?— Dorothy Dodge
