my t ye. Although I have never
been a member of any organiza
tion supporting the following
ideas, I believe that they should
be printed in the interests of
academic freedom.
MAN IS JUST A WORM
"Men are what women marry.
They have two hands, two feet,
and ; ometimes two wives—but
never more than one dollar or
idea at a time. Like Turkish

cigaiettes, they are ail made of the same material.
l'h" only di't ronee i. onie are better disguised than
others.
. . If you flatter a man, you frighten him to
death. Ii you don't flatter him, you drive him to
drink. If you permit him to make love to you, he

gets tired of you in the end; and if you don't, he gets
tired of you in the beginning.
"If you believe him in everything, you cease to
interest him. If you argue witli him in everything,
you cease to charm him. But if you believe all he
tells you. he thinks you are a fool. And if you don't,
he think:; you are a cynic.
''If you wear gay colors, rough and startling hats,
he hesitates to take you out—but if you wear a little
brown beret and a tailor-made suit, he takes you out
and then stares all evening at women in gay colors,
rough and startling hats.
'It you join in the gaiety and approve of his
drinking, he swears up and down you are driving
him to the devil. If you don't approve of his drink
ing and urge him to give it up, he vows you arc s
snob.
"If you are the clinging vine type, he doubts
whether you have a brain. If you are a modern,
advanced, intelligent, he doubts whether you have
a heart. If you arc silly, he longs for a playmate.
"Man is just a worm in the dust. He comes along,
wigglc;s around for a while- and finally some chicken
gets him."
