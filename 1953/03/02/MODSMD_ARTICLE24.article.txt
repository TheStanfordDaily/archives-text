## More on the Rosenbergs 
### 
To the Editor:
We would like to comment on your article and
ueto.ial of Tuesday, February 24, on the Rosenberg
L'.ise.
We think the headline "Slick Talker . . ." was
1 it lily prejudicial and not at all in line with fair
journali m. One would think from that headline
th: the material and facts presented were not as
niif >rt nt as the matter of presentation.
Even though an editorial is the writer's opinion,
we think that that editorial was totally unfair to your
loader and to those others who believe that the
Rosenb( rgs should be granted clemency.
\'<ui iv that "For .!! the world he didn't seem
to be a Communist . . ." Does this mean that
t vcy<.!!'■ who asl's foi clemency is suspect? Would
v< ■ have us believe that the non-Communist who
intc venes on behalf of the Rosenbergs is a rarity?
Would you siv of Albert Einstein or Dr. Harold
Uiey or Pope Pius that "For all the world he didn't
seem to be a Communist . . .'"? Rev. Dr. Bernard M.
Loomer, Dean of Chicago University's School of
Theology, made public a letter of clemency to Eisen
hovvi r on behalf of over 2,000 clergymen representing
'.'b communion: in the United States and nossessions.
Do you question the sincerity of these men?
I'he Rosenberg Con;mittee has inhumation (hat
the Justice Dept., with Attorney-CJeneral BrownoH's
appro , al, recommended clemency to the President.
Should Mi Browne 11 be suspect?
It would .'em that the efforts to secure clemency
and a new trial have taken on world wide proportions.
Thous'iids of [ rominent and other people have ox
prt std tbemselve; to the US. Government. Con
servative anti-Communist newspapers such as the
Paris "Figaro." and "Combat" and the "New York
J wish Forward'' have expressed horror at the sen
tence. Do you think that these people are "ignorant
• opie who will follow any kind of cleverly handled
cursr.de"?
Yen yourself write of the representative uroun at
the meeting in Palo Alto, which group included
"Stanford students" who had come intent on argu
ing . . ". We do not believe, however, as you imply,
that all o! u Stanford students would come not to be

informed or investigate, but only to argue. We be
lli ve. rather, that open mindedness would more
accurately describe? Stanford students.
You describe the Committee as "financially sutTi
cient." If that is so. why must they appeal for funds
in this way?
Although you say that you are not equipped to
make an "adequate judgment," you conclude that the
Committee will "harass and delay" the courts. Delay
the courts in what way? Delay them from executing
the Rosenbergs? Isn't that exactly what this whole
tiling is about? Is it inconceivable that the Rosen
berg.-; are innocent as they claim? Would you want
to execute a couple before every doubt—and there
are millions of people who have grave doubts— before
every doubt is cleared up?
The U.S. Court of Appeals stated that in view of
the behavior of the prosecutor, if a new trial had been
demanded at the time, it should have been granted.
The defense hn ( - an affidavit by the government that
one of its witnesses, a passport photographer, had
perjured himself on the stand.
The Rosenberg defense is appealing for a new
review ' > the Supreme Court. The defense ha«- been
joined by Attorney John 11. Finerty, a member of
th<' Rorrd of American Civil Liberties Union, who
stated to press and radio that he was joining the
defense because be was convinced from reading the
the record that the conviction was procured on per
jured testimony.
Mr Fineity represented Sacco & Vanzetti, and also
reprc. en ted Tom Mooney before the Supreme Court.
His clients wre :<ll later vindicated although it was
too late foi Sacco it Vanzetti who were executed in
1927.
We think the Rosenberg Committee is doing a
service for America, for without their efforts and sup
port (vncit* lous and otherwise) of thousandsof people,
the possibility of a new trial, bared on new evidence
which they say they have, would never exist. The
Rosenbe'j would have been executed And if after
they wei" dead their innocence wore proven; what
then of America's conscience?
