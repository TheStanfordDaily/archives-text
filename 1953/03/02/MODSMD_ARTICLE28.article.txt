### 
In his sermon, "Victorious in
Temptation," in Memorial Church
I yesterday, the Rev. Charles F.
! W his ton from the Episcopalian
| Church Divinity School of the Pa-
I cific in Berkeley pointed out how
I often we are subject to temptation
i and how we can overcome it.
According to Whiston, there is a
j "lonely, interior warfare," and we
are "so often defeated that we have
a sense of guilt and shame." But,
he said, there "can come into our
lives victory in temptation, . . .
locked in the person of Jesus
Christ." We yee that "victory is
possible, because it has been done
by him."
One of the church's chief func
tions, he said, is to remind u.-; of
Christ, who lived a "godly life under
j earthly conditions."
