# Baseballers Look Great; Win Two Contests
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
Stanford's basebaiiers ex
tended their undefeated string
to six games in a row over the
weekend as they downed the
Alameda Naval Air Station 9 to
4, and USF 9 to 1. This gave the
Indians five wins this season
with one tie.
The hard-hitting Cards collected
12 hits in each contest, but used
different formulas to solve out a
victory.
Against the Hellcats, it was a big
seven-run last of the third, while
in Saturday's tilt with the Don:-,
the Indians spread out their scoring
to every inning but two.
Triples by Rich Scramaglia and
Ray Swarts gave the Cards single
runs in the first and second against
Alameda, but in the last of the
third, the roof fell in on Navy start
er Manny Carasco.
Six hits rattled off Stanford bats,
and with Alameda chipping in with
two errors, the Cards had seven
runs.
Big blows of the inning were
struck by left fielder Chuck Esse
gian and first baseman Hal Hen
nacy. Chuck blasted a 450 - foot
triple on the fly to right center,
while Hal collected a double.

Bob Murphy became the first In
dian hurler to go the distance on ;
Friday. Although rapped for 11 hits, ,
Bob bore down in the clutch and j
gave up but one earned run.
Rich Scramaglia and Murphy |
paced the Cards at the plate with !
two safeties apiece, while second j
sacker Bill Boyette and catcher Lee j
Browning had three singles each i
lor Alameda.
A name unfamiliar to Farm base
ball followers sparkled in Satur- |
day's conquest of the Dons.
'iom Dandurand, a JC transfer J
playing right field, gave the fans a
big thrill when he lofted the second j
Sunken Diamond home run of the |
season 380 feet over the left field j
fence with none on in the last of
the seventh. It was only the 25th
ball hit out of the Sunken Diamond
since its construction in l'J3l.
Left-hander Phil Page scintillated
on the mound for the Cards as he
turned in six shutout innings. Phil
scattered four singles and faced but
21 men in his tenure on the hill.
I Right-hander Mike Acker worked
! the lust three frames and coughed
I up the one run for the Dons.

OUT AT HOME—HaI Hennacy was nailed at home in this play,
but the Cards still managed to swamp USF 9 to 4. The white
spot on home plate is not the ball, unfortunately, but Hennacy's
sock. The baseball team has won live and tied one in six tries.

Stanford's basebaiiers ex
tended their undefeated string
to six games in a row over the
weekend as they downed the
Alameda Naval Air Station 9 to
4, and USF 9 to 1. This gave the
Indians five wins this season
with one tie.
The hard-hitting Cards collected
12 hits in each contest, but used
different formulas to solve out a
victory.
Against the Hellcats, it was a big
seven-run last of the third, while
in Saturday's tilt with the Don:-,
the Indians spread out their scoring
to every inning but two.
Triples by Rich Scramaglia and
Ray Swarts gave the Cards single
runs in the first and second against
Alameda, but in the last of the
third, the roof fell in on Navy start
er Manny Carasco.
Six hits rattled off Stanford bats,
and with Alameda chipping in with
two errors, the Cards had seven
runs.
Big blows of the inning were
struck by left fielder Chuck Esse
gian and first baseman Hal Hen
nacy. Chuck blasted a 450 - foot
triple on the fly to right center,
while Hal collected a double.

Bob Murphy became the first In
dian hurler to go the distance on ;
Friday. Although rapped for 11 hits, ,
Bob bore down in the clutch and j
gave up but one earned run.
Rich Scramaglia and Murphy |
paced the Cards at the plate with !
two safeties apiece, while second j
sacker Bill Boyette and catcher Lee j
Browning had three singles each i
lor Alameda.

OUT AT HOME—HaI Hennacy was nailed at home in this play,
but the Cards still managed to swamp USF 9 to 4. The white
spot on home plate is not the ball, unfortunately, but Hennacy's
sock. The baseball team has won live and tied one in six tries.
