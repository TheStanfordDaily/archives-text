is an amazing one. It goes like this:
When he was 21 he got a job as
pianist-arranger for Sammy Kaye.
After a seven year stretch in the
service. Flanagan returned to civilian
life to arrange music for such per
sonalities as Charlie Barnet, Tony

Martin, and Perry Como.
In 1949 RCA Victor began looking
for someone who could turn out in
strumental sides with a strong dance
beat and thus generate a new in
terest in dance music. Not since the
Benny Goodman-Glenn Miller hey
day had any new dance band been
able to build up a following.
Disc jockey response to Flanagan's
first release, "You're Breaking My
Heart," was overwhelming. This was
followed by such big sellers as "Pent
house Serenade," "Joshua" and "An
American in Paris."
In 1950 the new band made its
debut. Three days later an estimated
4,000 people were turned away and
cars were stacked bumper to bumper
for three miles from the ballroom
back into town.
When asked his secret for con
sistently drawing capacity crowds,
Flanagan says,"I have none. The
public wants music they can listen
to and dance to. I give it to them,
with no gimmicks attached."
