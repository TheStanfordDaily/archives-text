WASHINGTON â€” Embarrassed
Iron Curtain nations are using land
mines, flares* bells, and dogs in ef
forts to prevent refugees from flee
ing to the Western world, officials
said today.
They said nothing hurts Commu
nist propaganda so much as the
continuous flow of escapees to the
free world. As a result Red leaders
during the past have sharply in
creased efforts to seal their borders.
In addition, security police now
hide on camouflaged observation
platforms in trees overlooking the
border and on rooftops.
