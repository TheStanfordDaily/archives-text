# CAL CAGERS ROLL
## Matheny, McKeen Spell Doom for Beaten Cards 
### MIKE HUDSON Daily Sports Editor 
Cal's cagers rolled over Stanford last week-end in two games
that must rank with the USC football game last fall as low-points
in Stanford sports history.
Even the most ardent Card fans were forced to salute the hard
wood artistry of Cal's Mutt-and-Jeff combination of Bob McKeen

and Bob Matheny. They put on
zling exhibitions of shooting, defen
sive play, and backboard control as
they bombed the Cards to 82-63 and |
97-63 defeats.
Cal's McKeen edged out Stan- j
ford's Tomsic in PCC scoring hon- j
ors. McKeen scored 53 points to |
hoist his total to 234 for the season,
the third highest number of points
ever scored and the most ever
scored by a sophomore.
Tomsic tanked 36 to end up
with 226 points, the fifth highest
total ever scored. They will have !
two more seasons to determine
which one will he the greatest
scorer in PCC history.
Friday night's contest before a
packed Pavilion found Cal getting
off to a 9-8 lead in a torrid first few
minutes. Then McKeen hit a hook j
and Matheny hit a twisting lay-up
to set the pattern for the series.
Stanford stayed fairly close to Cal
through the first half mainly on the
soft set shots and jumps of Paul
Johnson, who dropped seven
straight buckets through in the sec
ond quarter.
A 25-point third quarter by the
Bears turned the game into a near
rout. At one time the Cal dead-eyes
hit nine straight shots.
Tomsic led the Card scorers
with 1!) points. Johnson had 17
and Olic SuzdalclT tanked 12
points and held the league's fifth
best scorer, John Ricksen. to no
field goals and one point.
Matheny led the Bears with 27
points. He scored on every con
ceivable type of lay-up and showed
why he was chosen Northern Cali
fornia's player of the year.
Saturday, the Bears' 97 - point
output broke the Cal Gym and PCC
scoring marks. The Bears scored 29
points in the first and last quarters.
In the last quarter, Cal played
its first string in order to hit 11M>,
hut couldn't quite make it.
Stanford attempted to set up
Tomsic so that he could stay ahead
of McKeen. but the stubby sopho
more was hampered by otT-night
shooting and three Bears on hi.'-
back. He still managed 17 markers
to tie Suzdaleff for high point hon

Cal's cagers rolled over Stanford last week-end in two games
that must rank with the USC football game last fall as low-points
in Stanford sports history.
Even the most ardent Card fans were forced to salute the hard
wood artistry of Cal's Mutt-and-Jeff combination of Bob McKeen

and Bob Matheny. They put on
zling exhibitions of shooting, defen
sive play, and backboard control as
they bombed the Cards to 82-63 and |
97-63 defeats.
Cal's McKeen edged out Stan- j
ford's Tomsic in PCC scoring hon- j
ors. McKeen scored 53 points to |
hoist his total to 234 for the season,
the third highest number of points
ever scored and the most ever
scored by a sophomore.
Tomsic tanked 36 to end up
with 226 points, the fifth highest
total ever scored. They will have !
two more seasons to determine
which one will he the greatest
scorer in PCC history.
Friday night's contest before a
packed Pavilion found Cal getting
off to a 9-8 lead in a torrid first few
minutes. Then McKeen hit a hook j
and Matheny hit a twisting lay-up
to set the pattern for the series.
Stanford stayed fairly close to Cal
through the first half mainly on the
soft set shots and jumps of Paul
Johnson, who dropped seven
straight buckets through in the sec
ond quarter.
A 25-point third quarter by the
Bears turned the game into a near
rout. At one time the Cal dead-eyes
hit nine straight shots.
Tomsic led the Card scorers
with 1!) points. Johnson had 17
and Olic SuzdalclT tanked 12
points and held the league's fifth
best scorer, John Ricksen. to no
field goals and one point.
Matheny led the Bears with 27
points. He scored on every con
ceivable type of lay-up and showed
why he was chosen Northern Cali
fornia's player of the year.
Saturday, the Bears' 97 - point
output broke the Cal Gym and PCC
scoring marks. The Bears scored 29
points in the first and last quarters.
In the last quarter, Cal played
its first string in order to hit 11M>,
hut couldn't quite make it.
Stanford attempted to set up
Tomsic so that he could stay ahead
of McKeen. but the stubby sopho
more was hampered by otT-night
shooting and three Bears on hi.'-
back. He still managed 17 markers
to tie Suzdaleff for high point hon
