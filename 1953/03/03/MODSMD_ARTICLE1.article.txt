## U.S. Rushes Production Of Hydrogen Bombs 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 3 (UP) —The United States is rushing ef
forts to produce hydrogen bombs—with an estimated destructive
capacity of more than 100 square miles each—for use in case of a
military emergency.
Two giant hydrogen explosions were set off last fall at Eniwe-

tok, at least one of them said to
have been some 150 times as pow
erful as the World War II atom
bomb.
But there are no deliverable H
bombs as yet in the nation's ready
to-use arsenal, according to author
itative sources. Atomic experts are
striving to produce several even be
fore the Savannah River H-bomb
plant goes into operation.
Quantity production of H-bomb.s
cannot get under way until the $1,-
500,000,000 plant near Aiken, S.C.,
starts up. This may not be until
some time in 1954.
Meanwhile the hurry-up project
has been launched to ready at
least two or three—possibly more
—of the big bombs for use in
event of a military crisis
The hydrogen devices exploded at
Eniwetok last fall were not what
the military calls "operational"
weapons which could be placed in
a bomber and carried to a target.
Bomb experts at the Atomic En
ergy Commission's Los Alamos and
Sandia laboratories in New Mexico
are working out the engineering
difliculties which stand in the way
of a true weapon.
