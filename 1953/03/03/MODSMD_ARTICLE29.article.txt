# Awake to the Publicity Probes
## 
### 
It's time that Stanford students and others
across the country wake up, wake up and listen
to some of their Senators and Representatives,
particularly to Senators joseph R. McCarthy
and William E. lenner and Representative Har
old Velde, the heads of Congress's three chief
investigating committees.
The three, along with other congressmen
(possibly the one from your district?), are cur
rently probing everything from the Voice of
America to education. And they're doing it in
the same headline hunting fashion of the old
Dies committee.
Traditionally, the purpose of congressional
investigations has been to find facts on which
to build legislation. But (he purpose of the
current invesigations, admittedly, is not to
frame legislation, but to "shine the spotlight
of publicity" on those who are not, to use
some of McCarthy's loose language, "100
peicent Americans."
The publicity angle—that's their pitch.
Nationally known figures, hailed before
the committees, are forced to define their loy
alty and prove the degree of their allegiance,
as if it could stand the yard rule test. They are
forced to submit to all the harangue and name
calling the committees wish to employ, and do
so without complaint, without an oportunity for
adequate self defense.
Acting in the powerful role of prosecutor,
jury, and judge, the committees have vio
lated, for the sake of publicity, many of the
freedoms and privileges traditionally ac
corded a witness.
To build their case, the comittees have
stacked hearings with witnesses friendly to
their narow viewpoints.
But the tricky and isidious aspect of all this is
that an accused individual has no chance to

cross examine these prosecutions witnesses.
Nor does the accused have an oportunity to call
witnesses on his own behail. Nor does he have
the right to consult with his counsel during a
session. Nor does he have the right to make a
statement at the conclusion of his testimony.
His only privilege is to answer the leading
guestions put him by committee members. If
he refuses to answer, then he faces a possible
contempt charge and jail.
Thus stripped of almost every right of self
defense, an acused witness must bear up under
the merciless glare of the "spotlight of publi
city."
He must bear up while education is defiled
and patriots like General George C. Marshall
are vilified. He must hear up while the fires
of national fear and suspicion are kindled.
And he must watch while the clever propa
gandists of the Communist party take advan
tage of the general distrust.
For one thing the high handed way in which
the committees conduct their hearings is a sting
ing propaganda point. Too, the busy, some
times unscrupulous manuevering of the House
and Senate investigators interferes with the
carefully plotted work of the FBI.
And too, the hearings, their findings often
vague and inconclusive, tend to confuse the
Communist issue, exaggerating it here, under
playing it there.
No one denies that Congress has the right to
investigate, to uncover facts on which to es
tablish sound legislation.
But we wonder if Congress has the right to
conduct reckless probes that endanger reputa
tions, hurt honest, high minded causes . . .
probes that unsettle American thinking and aid
the Reds in plucking at our ties of unity.

conduct reckless probes that endanger reputa
tions, hurt honest, high minded causes . . .
probes that unsettle American thinking and aid
the Reds in plucking at our ties of unity.
—Hadley Roff
It's time that Stanford students and others
across the country wake up, wake up and listen
to some of their Senators and Representatives,
particularly to Senators joseph R. McCarthy
and William E. lenner and Representative Har
old Velde, the heads of Congress's three chief
investigating committees.
The three, along with other congressmen
(possibly the one from your district?), are cur
rently probing everything from the Voice of
America to education. And they're doing it in
the same headline hunting fashion of the old
Dies committee.
Traditionally, the purpose of congressional
investigations has been to find facts on which
to build legislation. But (he purpose of the
current invesigations, admittedly, is not to
frame legislation, but to "shine the spotlight
of publicity" on those who are not, to use
some of McCarthy's loose language, "100
peicent Americans."
The publicity angle—that's their pitch.
Nationally known figures, hailed before
the committees, are forced to define their loy
alty and prove the degree of their allegiance,
as if it could stand the yard rule test. They are
forced to submit to all the harangue and name
calling the committees wish to employ, and do
so without complaint, without an oportunity for
adequate self defense.
Acting in the powerful role of prosecutor,
jury, and judge, the committees have vio
lated, for the sake of publicity, many of the
freedoms and privileges traditionally ac
corded a witness.
To build their case, the comittees have
stacked hearings with witnesses friendly to
their narow viewpoints.
But the tricky and isidious aspect of all this is
that an accused individual has no chance to

cross examine these prosecutions witnesses.
Nor does the accused have an oportunity to call
witnesses on his own behail. Nor does he have
the right to consult with his counsel during a
session. Nor does he have the right to make a
statement at the conclusion of his testimony.
His only privilege is to answer the leading
guestions put him by committee members. If
he refuses to answer, then he faces a possible
contempt charge and jail.
Thus stripped of almost every right of self
defense, an acused witness must bear up under
the merciless glare of the "spotlight of publi
city."
He must bear up while education is defiled
and patriots like General George C. Marshall
are vilified. He must hear up while the fires
of national fear and suspicion are kindled.
And he must watch while the clever propa
gandists of the Communist party take advan
tage of the general distrust.
For one thing the high handed way in which
the committees conduct their hearings is a sting
ing propaganda point. Too, the busy, some
times unscrupulous manuevering of the House
and Senate investigators interferes with the
carefully plotted work of the FBI.
And too, the hearings, their findings often
vague and inconclusive, tend to confuse the
Communist issue, exaggerating it here, under
playing it there.
No one denies that Congress has the right to
investigate, to uncover facts on which to es
tablish sound legislation.
But we wonder if Congress has the right to
conduct reckless probes that endanger reputa
tions, hurt honest, high minded causes . . .
probes that unsettle American thinking and aid
the Reds in plucking at our ties of unity.
