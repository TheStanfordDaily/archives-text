### DICK MANSFIELD 
The scene is a grotto deep beneath History corner
where one ol' the Western Civ professors has been
given ;.r\ office. He doesn't complain after teaching
about Stoics for twenty years, he has become one.
Tht re comes a scratching at the door, and ENTER

Maurice Hupp, a very young
Western Civ instruction. As a
matter of fact, Hupp just got in
from Lii Grande Normal and he's
worried.
HUPP: "Mr. Charlemagne, sir
. . . could I speak to you for a
moment?"
CHARLEMAGNE: "Certainly,
Hupp. Have a stalagtite."
HUPP: "Thank you. Mr. Char
lemagne ... it's about the lec-

ture, sir. They've asked me to give a Civ lecture on
Monday, sir,"
CHARLEMAGNE: (Aghast) "Net the chivalry
K'.ture, Hupp?"
HUPP: (Shamefaced) "Yes, sir . . . the chivalry
lecture. I have my noles light here, Mr. Charle
magne . . ."
CHARLEMAGNE: "Notes? Oh, no. Hupp. You've
got the wrong attitude. No Civ lecturer can use
notes."
HUPP: "But I've seen them reading as they go
along."
CHARLEMAGNE: "Oh. they have a copy of the
Daily up there. To keep them awake."
HUPP: "That's what I want, Sir! Hints for suc
cess." (Produces thick manuscript and tears it in
half).
CHARLEMAGNE: "Now, listen. Hupp. I want you

to get off to a good start bore. Keep a few things in
mind . . ."
HUPP: (Eagerly) "I'll take notes . . ."
CHARLEMAGNE: "First of all, speak in a low,
distinct voice. But not so distinct that you can he
heard. Just distinct enough so that they'll get the
feeling all this stuff will be on the exam. Every now
and then, pause and chuckle. That's what we Civ
lecturers call a witticism."
HUPP: "Chuckle? At what?"
CHARLEMAGNE: ' Well, you can try to see the
humor in the situation. Consider the number of dogs
in the balcony . . ."
HUPP: (Shudders) "I'll try. sir."
CHARLEMAGNE: "Excellent spirit, Hupp! Now,
talk things over in advance with the sound man. If
attention lags in the front row -that's when they start
talking in their sleepâ€”have him crank up the volume
to full. Then ask them is they can hear it in the back.
The dogs will probably howl, but so will the sound
system."
HUPP: "But without notes, what will I say?"
CHARLEMAGNE: "Anything, Hupp, anything.
Keep it historic, though. Throw in names and dates.
Start every other sentence with: 'Probably the most
important fact to be remembered from this period
is . . .'"
HUPP: "They have an outline, sir. Should I follow
it?"
CHARLEMAGNE: "Hupp, your incompetence as
tounds me. Of course not. Mention something from
the outline occasionally, but don't elaborate. Keep
them thinking! This course teaches them to think!"
HUPP: "Yes sir! I'll certainly keep it in mind, Mr.
Charlemagne. And thank you, sir! Well, almost 11
o'clock . . ." (EXIT Hupp)
