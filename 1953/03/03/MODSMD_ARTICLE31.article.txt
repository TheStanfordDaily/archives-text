(Editor's note: The following is (he second eol
in.in to appear in "Krom Another Viewpoint" by
Kev. Alexander Miller, lecturer in religion. Two
weeks apo Mr. Miller wrot« "On Piety and Fxuber
anee."

Meeting members of one of my classes the other
day.it came on me with a shock of realization that I
was old enough to be their father- or at least to be
the father of any one of them. This has induced in

ine a paternal, anecdotal sort of mr
mood, of which you might as wel!
have the benefit.
Now when I was young thing l
were different, as I remember
Wt breathed, for one thing, 112
different intellectual air. The
pious characters who think life if
difficult in Western Civ should
have lived through the late twon
ties and early thirties when noth
ing was sacred, not cv( 11 Western
Civilization.

The frail plant of piety breathe. ....
11 a chill wind of scepticism. The prevailing intellec
ual assumption was that piety was on its way out,
issi'-ted by a firm kick in the pants from a virile and
onfident science.
"Christianity," said a young representative of (he
popular mood, "is dead. The only (juration is how
to get rid of the body before it begins to smell too
in 11 eh."
The iconoclasts were on the rampage. 11. L. Men
ten ("Love is the illusion that one woman is different

from another.") the younger Huxley, the younger
Joad, and many a colleague did nubile work on the
sacred images and good work too, if a little in
discriminate, .since many of the images were due for
a fall.
Times indeed have changed.
Christianity, once considered as at best a soothing
syrup for low-biows, is in danger, as Dorothy Sayers
points out, of becoming a close preserve of the high
brows. Hardly a responsible scholar today but would
cock a quizzical eyebrow if asked about the "conflict"
between science and religion. Once we assumed that
a thing was not true if it could not. be proved. We
are now more inclined to asume that is a thing ran
be proved it is likely to he trivial.
The most influential of the moderns are preoccu
pied with the issues of faith. Fort faith. ;is Ralph
Barton Perry pointed out the other day. is not an
evasion of the quest for truth, ("Be'ieving what you
know isn't true."): it is a demand that life makes upon
every sonl that breathe;-. "Man believe* prematurely
in order that In* may net expeditiously." Graham
Greehe, Christopher Fry, Camus, Eliot and Auden in
literature; Niebuhr and Maritain, Berdyaev and
Tillieh in philosophy; the oldei Huxley and the older
Joad are all busy with the religious question.
To breathe the intellectual air of our time is to
breathe an air congenial to piety. This does not make
Christianity true, but it does mean that wo can bend
the mind to it without tepping.outside the skin of out
modernity.
And this, my young friends, doe: not mean that
life is easier for you than it was lor us. It does mean
that life is simpler, since living itself has shar|>eru d
the issues to a point of decision.

To breathe the intellectual air of our time is to
breathe an air congenial to piety. This does not make
Christianity true, but it does mean that wo can bend
the mind to it without tepping.outside the skin of out
modernity.
And this, my young friends, doe: not mean that
life is easier for you than it was lor us. It does mean
that life is simpler, since living itself has shar|>eru d
the issues to a point of decision.
