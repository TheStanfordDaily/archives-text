# THE 						DU PONT DIGEST
## THE 						ENGINEER'S PLACE IN Plant Development Another phase of Du Pont production activities offers challenging work for the technical man 
### 
In most Du Pont manufacturing
plants you'll find two groups of engi
neers working side by side to make
operations more efficient —to reduce
costs and improve quality. The so
cialized work of one group, the pro
duction supervisors, has been rather
fully discussed in the Digest.
Equally vital is the work of devel
opment men—the men responsible
for advising management when op
erational changes should be made for
economic or technical reasons.
Engineers from several fields of
tr.-iining are employed in develop
ment activities al Du Pont. Tt.seema

to hnve a special appeal for the man
who enn take on a big problem, ana
lyze its parts, and come up with a
thoughtful, reasoned solution.
Individual development studies
may begin in a number of different,
ways. Often they are sparked by the
imagination of the engineer himself,
who, of course, be familiar with
production costs, activities of com
petition, and recent or impending
technical improvements.
Studies also may be inspired by
suggestions of production supervi
sors or sales personnel, obsolescense
of equipment, advances in eompeti-

live products, or the presence of
unsatisfactory profit margins.
In a single study, the engineer may
draw data from laboratories, semi
works and plant-scale experiments,
prepare an estimate of profits and in
vestments and consult with numer
ous specialists on various phases of
the problem, both within the Com
pany and outside.
Having collected data from these
many sources and perhaps from an
independent study of his own, the
plant development engineer inns'
then assemble and evaluate* t he ma
terial and prepare a recommenda
tion that is based on sound engineer
ing judgment.
Whether a product or process im
proves from the standpoint of com
petition, profit and efficiency de
pends, in great degree, on the quality
of its plant development work. The
development engineer's job is a re
sponsible one at Du Pont, and the
work of a good man is soon noticed.
