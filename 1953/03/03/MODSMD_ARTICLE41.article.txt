# Frosh Five Wins Two
## 
### 
Two close wins over the Califor
nia Cubs last weekend climaxed a
successful season's campaign of 17
wins and one loss for Stanford's
frosh basketball team.
George Selleck, leading team
scorer with 271 points, put in 53
points while Denny Boren contrib
uted valuable work under the back
boards to lead in the Papoose vic
tories.
At the Pavilion Friday night the
Cal hoopinen, losers in two pre
vious contests to Coacli Dick
Clegg's team, jumped off to a 13-8
first-quarter lead. Boren, not a
starter because of torn ligaments
in his ankle, got into the game at
the start of the second quarter
and aided the frosh in gaining a
35 -33 half - time edge. Boren's
teammate on South Pasadena's
high - school five, Cal center Al
Polkinghorne, previously had a
monopoly on the hoards, but Bo
ren began grabbing the rebounds
and tipped in one score.

Meanwhile' Selleck began collect
ing charity tosses, and in his eve
ning's total of 24 points were 12 of
14 successful free throws attempted.
Final score ended up 74-66.
Saturday play shifted to the Ber
keley campus where the Cubs were
handed a 76-72 defeat in a contest
bogged down by 72 fouls. Fouls
hurt the Papooses to the point
where the team's first four forwards
fouled out, but Selleck cashed in
on the whistle-calling by sinking 15
of 19 free throw tosses to add to
his point total of 29 markers. Jerry
Gustafson, Ron Wagner, and John
Hendricks each contributed nine
points to Papoose scoring. Boren's
rebounding proved just as helpful
along with a tip-in in the late min
utes of the game which held off a
Cub rally.
Only black mark on the frosh
record was a 77-69 loss to Santa
Clara while the victories were
gained against nine high schools and
five college frosh teams.
