# Baldocchi Is Farm's Best Boxer
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Light - heavywe : ght Bob Bal
iocchi—"on his record one oi
he top boxers in Stanford his
ory," according to Coach Rav
Lunny — tasted defeat for the
•irst time in two years last Wed
lesaay against Cal.
Before last week's defeat he had
chalked up nine straight victories.
His string included four dual-meet
wins last season as a light-heavy
and five last season as a middle
weight.
In the next'PCl tourney, however,
Bob is rated "the man to beat in his
division" by Coach Lunny. Bal
docchi also figures to make a good
showing in the Northern California
championships that precede the
PCI matches.
Although he will graduate as a
psychology major this summer, Bal
docchi forgets his classroom tech
niques when he steps into the ring
and relies strictly on devastating
punches. The power of Bob's fists
told the tale in his first three fights
this year all were won via the
technical knockout route.
"Bob is no fancy Dan," comment
ed Lunny. "He's a rough, tough
guy with a good wallop. No picture
fighter, Bob's a slugger not a boxer,
featuring a variety of effective
punches."
Baldocchi can hit hard with either
hand, but he himself says,"The
left hook is my best punch. 1 don't
know just what I do inside the ring
(there are no movies taken of the
bouts); I just step up and hit the
other guy as hard and as often as
possible."
Baldocchi puts in about two and
a half hours of training a day. He
keeps his legs in shape with road
work in the morning and then
works out with the gloves in the
afternoon, usually going a couple of
rounds with heavyweight Norm
Manoogian.
His boxing plans include no
thoughts of professional competi
tion; that is definitely out as far
as Baldocchi is concerned. His im
mediate goal is a good showing in
the Northern California and PCI
tournaments, which he hopes will
springboard him into this year's
NCAA tourney.
