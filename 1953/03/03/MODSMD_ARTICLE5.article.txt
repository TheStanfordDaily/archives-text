SAN FRANCISCO, March 2
I (UP)—Adlai E. Stevenson, the
man who lost the election, today
urged California Democratic
leaders to forget campaign dif
ferences and throw their full sup
port behind President Eisen
hower, whom he described as "a
great American who has given,
our country a valuable service." i
In jaunty high spirits as he pre- !
j pared to embark on a four-month I
world tour, Stevenson quipped his
way through a 10-minute off-the
cuff talk to some 500 pei-sons at an
informal Democratic reception.
He turned serious only as he
| praised President Eisenhower as "a
great American" and called for
"genuine support" of the Republi
can administration as it faces the
weighty problems of the world.
"Only time will tell whether the
I public was right in their choice !
last Nov. 4," he said. "But it is
j not important who lost the elec
[ tion.
"What is important is the Unit
j ed States. And there is no ulti
mate victory in vindication. We
| owe the administration all the
! support and encouragement we
can possibly give it.
Stevenson was scheduled to de
part for Honolulu at 4 p.m. aboard I
the liner President Wilson, but was
delayed nearly three hours when
the ship's sailing was held up by a
labor dispute.
Accompanied by his executive
| secretary, William McCormick Blair
; Jr., he will visit Japan and Korea
before going on to the Middle East,
Germany, and Great Britain.
The former candidate said he was
making his trip as a private citizen
to find out what is going on in the
world, but said the number of re
ceptions and crowds he had met
since leaving the Middle West made
him again feel "like a trained don
key."
"But I'm a very happy donkey,"
I he added, "because so many people
j such as you supported me during
the campaign."
