# Weiskopf: 'Neo-Fascism Exaggerated'
## 
### JANE LINDEMUTH 
"NEO - FASCISM IN GER
MANY!"
"GERMANY RISJNG TO
NEW POWER!"

"DANGER!"
Those are the Western newspaper
headlines that Oskur Weiskopf, AS
SU foreign scholar from Germany,
views with alarm.
"Your Western papers write too
much about neo-fascism in Ger
many," Weiskopf believes. "There is
something true—some unreasonable
acts by French and English create

such nationalism —but it would be j
better if the Americans would write j
about our growing democracy.
American public opinion should i
give more support to German de
mocracy —and in that way contrib
ute to neo-fascism's doom," he said.
' One of our greatest problems," j
stated Weiskopf, "is the split of Ger- 1
many into two states. Each month
approximately 30,000 refugees filter
into West Berlin, an island in the
Eastern zone. Americans transport
those in danger to the West."
Without property, a job, a
house, or clothes, the refugee is '
another of Germany's problems, j
"Though one wants to help, it
is dillicult," Weiskopf explains. |
"Germany, herself, has so many
unemployed."
"The Russians made a Communist
republic out of East Germany," he
continues. "But West Germans
know that there is no free opinion,
no free thought or speech in East
Germany. I feel that East Germans
follow the Communist party be
cause they have to.
"Everything, all business, every
thing is run by the Communist gov
ernment. We cannot write to our
friends in the East — they cannot
listen to Western radio stations.
"West Germany's population in
creased approximately 20 per cent
after the last war due to the Yalta
agreement, giving all of East Ger
many to Poland. East Germans ex
pelled from their land brought West

Germany's population from 40,000,-
00U to 50,000.000."
To the question, "What do most
Germans think of Roosevelt?" Weis
kopf frowned, "Let us just say that
we think he made many mistakes."
As for the American Presiden
tial election, Weiskopf commented,
"I had never seen such a thing
before. It is funny. When I first
came here I could not realize
what all the rallies and shows had
to do with the election. There

would Ite a two-hour show and a
20-minute talk.
"In America it seems strange.
Your government runs along very
quietly between elections—then ev
ery four years there is an explo
sion. In Germany there are many
parties with special issues—a party
for the businessman, the worker,
and many more. In the United
States we find two parties with very
similar ideas."
According to Weiskopf, Euro
peans were not too much in favor
of Eisenhower before the elections.
"Even those who would have voted
Republican had they been in the
United States were afraid that Ei
senhower would be too rpuch of a
'strong man.' Germans had too
much bad experience with military
men. They were afraid Eisenhower
would begin a new era of 'power
polities'."
"Now we see the new adminis
tration continues economic co-op
eration with Germany, promoting
efforts for European unification.
Germans would like a united Eu
rope," he continued, "but this
unification is difficult because the
people cannot forget their resent
ments against each other. They
need strong backing to push them
to unite. Russia is a threat to all
countries. Separate, Europe could
fall. United, Europe can better
resist oppression."
To prevent future wars between
European peoples, Weiskopf sees
unification as the formation of one
European "community," having one
market, increased production, and a
higher standard of living.
A graduate student in political
science and international relations
at Stanford, Weiskopf came to the
United States last September. Upon
returning to Germany, he expects to
enter government administration
work. Born in Edenkoben, near
Heidelberg, Weiskopf finished high
school, attended the University of
Heidelberg for one year, studying
economics, then studied business
administration at the University of
Munich.
Before coming to America, Weis
kopf served as secretary for the
Academic Foreign Office in Munich
and, in that capacity, arranged to
exchange scholarships with Stan
ford students Jerry Drobny and
Larry Seering, who are now study
ing at the University of Munich.
In conclusion Weiskopf remarked,
"Exchange scholarships give stu
dents an opportunity to live and
study with foreign students —to
make friends in other lands, and to
promote international understand
ing."

would begin a new era of 'power
polities'."
"Now we see the new adminis
tration continues economic co-op
eration with Germany, promoting
efforts for European unification.
Germans would like a united Eu
rope," he continued, "but this
unification is difficult because the
people cannot forget their resent
ments against each other. They
need strong backing to push them
to unite. Russia is a threat to all
countries. Separate, Europe could
fall. United, Europe can better
resist oppression."
To prevent future wars between
European peoples, Weiskopf sees
unification as the formation of one
European "community," having one
market, increased production, and a
higher standard of living.
A graduate student in political
science and international relations
at Stanford, Weiskopf came to the
United States last September. Upon
returning to Germany, he expects to
enter government administration
work. Born in Edenkoben, near
Heidelberg, Weiskopf finished high
school, attended the University of
Heidelberg for one year, studying
economics, then studied business
administration at the University of
Munich.
Before coming to America, Weis
kopf served as secretary for the
Academic Foreign Office in Munich
and, in that capacity, arranged to
exchange scholarships with Stan
ford students Jerry Drobny and
Larry Seering, who are now study
ing at the University of Munich.
In conclusion Weiskopf remarked,
"Exchange scholarships give stu
dents an opportunity to live and
study with foreign students —to
make friends in other lands, and to
promote international understand
ing."

"NEO - FASCISM IN GER
MANY!"
"GERMANY RISJNG TO
NEW POWER!"

"DANGER!"
Those are the Western newspaper
headlines that Oskur Weiskopf, AS
SU foreign scholar from Germany,
views with alarm.
"Your Western papers write too
much about neo-fascism in Ger
many," Weiskopf believes. "There is
something true—some unreasonable
acts by French and English create

such nationalism —but it would be j
better if the Americans would write j
about our growing democracy.
American public opinion should i
give more support to German de
mocracy —and in that way contrib
ute to neo-fascism's doom," he said.
' One of our greatest problems," j
stated Weiskopf, "is the split of Ger- 1
many into two states. Each month
approximately 30,000 refugees filter
into West Berlin, an island in the
Eastern zone. Americans transport
those in danger to the West."
Without property, a job, a
house, or clothes, the refugee is '
another of Germany's problems, j
"Though one wants to help, it
is dillicult," Weiskopf explains. |
"Germany, herself, has so many
unemployed."
"The Russians made a Communist
republic out of East Germany," he
continues. "But West Germans
know that there is no free opinion,
no free thought or speech in East
Germany. I feel that East Germans
follow the Communist party be
cause they have to.
"Everything, all business, every
thing is run by the Communist gov
ernment. We cannot write to our
friends in the East — they cannot
listen to Western radio stations.
"West Germany's population in
creased approximately 20 per cent
after the last war due to the Yalta
agreement, giving all of East Ger
many to Poland. East Germans ex
pelled from their land brought West

Germany's population from 40,000,-
00U to 50,000.000."
To the question, "What do most
Germans think of Roosevelt?" Weis
kopf frowned, "Let us just say that
we think he made many mistakes."
As for the American Presiden
tial election, Weiskopf commented,
"I had never seen such a thing
before. It is funny. When I first
came here I could not realize
what all the rallies and shows had
to do with the election. There

would Ite a two-hour show and a
20-minute talk.
"In America it seems strange.
Your government runs along very
quietly between elections—then ev
ery four years there is an explo
sion. In Germany there are many
parties with special issues—a party
for the businessman, the worker,
and many more. In the United
States we find two parties with very
similar ideas."
According to Weiskopf, Euro
peans were not too much in favor
of Eisenhower before the elections.
"Even those who would have voted
Republican had they been in the
United States were afraid that Ei
senhower would be too rpuch of a
'strong man.' Germans had too
much bad experience with military
men. They were afraid Eisenhower
would begin a new era of 'power

"West Germany's population in
creased approximately 20 per cent
after the last war due to the Yalta
agreement, giving all of East Ger
many to Poland. East Germans ex
pelled from their land brought West

Germany's population from 40,000,-
00U to 50,000.000."
To the question, "What do most
Germans think of Roosevelt?" Weis
kopf frowned, "Let us just say that
we think he made many mistakes."
As for the American Presiden
tial election, Weiskopf commented,
"I had never seen such a thing
before. It is funny. When I first
came here I could not realize
what all the rallies and shows had
to do with the election. There

would Ite a two-hour show and a
20-minute talk.
"In America it seems strange.
Your government runs along very
quietly between elections—then ev
ery four years there is an explo
sion. In Germany there are many
parties with special issues—a party
for the businessman, the worker,
and many more. In the United
States we find two parties with very
similar ideas."
According to Weiskopf, Euro
peans were not too much in favor
of Eisenhower before the elections.
"Even those who would have voted
Republican had they been in the
United States were afraid that Ei
senhower would be too rpuch of a
'strong man.' Germans had too
much bad experience with military
men. They were afraid Eisenhower
would begin a new era of 'power
polities'."
"Now we see the new adminis
tration continues economic co-op
eration with Germany, promoting
efforts for European unification.
Germans would like a united Eu
rope," he continued, "but this
unification is difficult because the
people cannot forget their resent
ments against each other. They
need strong backing to push them
to unite. Russia is a threat to all
countries. Separate, Europe could
fall. United, Europe can better
resist oppression."
To prevent future wars between
European peoples, Weiskopf sees
unification as the formation of one
European "community," having one
market, increased production, and a
higher standard of living.
A graduate student in political
science and international relations
at Stanford, Weiskopf came to the
United States last September. Upon
returning to Germany, he expects to
enter government administration
work. Born in Edenkoben, near
Heidelberg, Weiskopf finished high
school, attended the University of
Heidelberg for one year, studying
economics, then studied business
administration at the University of
Munich.
Before coming to America, Weis
kopf served as secretary for the
Academic Foreign Office in Munich
and, in that capacity, arranged to
exchange scholarships with Stan
ford students Jerry Drobny and
Larry Seering, who are now study
ing at the University of Munich.
In conclusion Weiskopf remarked,
"Exchange scholarships give stu
dents an opportunity to live and
study with foreign students —to
make friends in other lands, and to
promote international understand
ing."

"NEO - FASCISM IN GER
MANY!"
"GERMANY RISJNG TO
NEW POWER!"

"DANGER!"
Those are the Western newspaper
headlines that Oskur Weiskopf, AS
SU foreign scholar from Germany,
views with alarm.
"Your Western papers write too
much about neo-fascism in Ger
many," Weiskopf believes. "There is
something true—some unreasonable
acts by French and English create

such nationalism —but it would be j
better if the Americans would write j
about our growing democracy.
American public opinion should i
give more support to German de
mocracy —and in that way contrib
ute to neo-fascism's doom," he said.
' One of our greatest problems," j
stated Weiskopf, "is the split of Ger- 1
many into two states. Each month
approximately 30,000 refugees filter
into West Berlin, an island in the
Eastern zone. Americans transport
those in danger to the West."
Without property, a job, a
house, or clothes, the refugee is '
another of Germany's problems, j
"Though one wants to help, it
is dillicult," Weiskopf explains. |
"Germany, herself, has so many
unemployed."
"The Russians made a Communist
republic out of East Germany," he
continues. "But West Germans
know that there is no free opinion,
no free thought or speech in East
Germany. I feel that East Germans
follow the Communist party be
cause they have to.
"Everything, all business, every
thing is run by the Communist gov
ernment. We cannot write to our
friends in the East — they cannot
listen to Western radio stations.
