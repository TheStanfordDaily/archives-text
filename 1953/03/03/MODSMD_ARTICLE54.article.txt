# KZSU's Sultry Sadie Bares Identity; She's Roble Frosh, Helene Fischer
## 
### JANE KRAVIG 
Deceptively sweet-looking, wist
fully sultry—Stanford Sadie!
This is Helene Fischer, Roble
freshman and KZSU's latest contri
bution to the inner conflicts of many
a Stanford man. For the last quar
ter, she has recounted weekly chap
ters from the as yet unpublished
story of her life among the tules at
Tulelake, Calif., to 5,000 avid and
3,000 jeaolus listeners of her Mon
day night program.
The five-foot six-inch, blue-eyed,
honey blonde temptress is the prod
uct of Tulelake High and a private
girls' school, but refused to compare
the two beyond saying, "Let's not
bring my preferences into it. I can
only say I try to benefit by all my
experiences."
Bored with her old way of life,
Helene auditioned for Sadie at the
beginning of the quarter after be
ing told she had a good voice for
"A sort of program we have."
"I didn't know any better then but
I'd do it over gladly—l'm beginning
to get the hang of it now," she com
mented. Despite this statement she
emphatically states that being Sadie
hasn't changed her at all; that she
still devotes her Saturday nights to
catching up on her studying and im
proving her mind. She still blushes
shyly as she says "Of course I didn't
come to Stanford because of the men.

I didn't even know there was a ratio I
until my sponsor told me."
Her advice to all future Sadies '
is a plea lhat they write their own
scripts, which are not written at |
present, but unearthed by three
KZSUers who coyly call them
selves Dirty Fred, Sneaky Pete, j
and Thumhy Bill, and who claim
that Sadie has doubled the per
centage of late leaves taken by
Roble girls this quarter.
After a brief period of recupera- j
tion, the present Sadie plans to do- j
vote her time and talents to a cam
paign to become the new subject of
Cap and Gown calendars, and to
collect her experiences into a book
—"All true, every word of it. Every
word." This we can believe.
