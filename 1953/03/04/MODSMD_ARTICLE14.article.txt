### R.G. MANSFIELD 
Rom Landau, expert on Morocco,
gave a vivid description of how an
"infamous" lobby in Paris, with less
than 20,000 members, is inhibiting
the legal independence of 9,000,000
Moroccans, as he spoke on "The Mo
roccan Crisis" in the last Tuesday
Evening Series lecture last night in
Memorial Auditorium.
The North African lobby, which
controls a bloc of .'JO votes in the
French Assembly, has kept Morocco
under the protectorate of France
until relations between the entire
Islamic empire of 700 million peo
ple has become antagonized, Lan
dau said.
"Whoever controls Morocco may
very well hold in his hand the
outcome of whatever war may
come," Landau said. Morocco's
geographical position, command
ing (lie entrance to the Mediter
ranean Sea, and its wealth of nat
ural resources make it valuable
l<» both Eastern and Western pow
ers.
Landau pointed out that Moroc
cans are "probably the most pious
ol Moslems.'' and are thus strongly
opposed to Communism.
Islamic nations, extending from
Morocco east through Africa and
India, are using the Moroccan cri
sis as a "test case for their relations
with the West," Laudau said.
Saying that the United States
lias Hie strength to case this situ
ation by intervening in favor of
Moroccan independence, Landau
urged such a move on the part of
the West.
"For once we find that the thing
which seems strategically correct at
this time is at the same time ethi
cally and morally correct," Landau
said in conclusion.
