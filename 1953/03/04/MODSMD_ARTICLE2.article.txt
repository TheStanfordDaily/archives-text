## Latin America Plan Rejected 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y.,
March 3 (UP) â€”The United States
tonight nipped in the bud a Latin
American campaign for new
United Nations action in the
deadlocked Korean crisis.
Brazil and Ecuador, undeterred
by Russia's refusal to budge on
Korea, had been considering a reso
lution urging the Chinese and Ko
rean Feds to reconsider their rejec
tion of the Indian truce plan.
But the U.S. privately made clear
its position to any such move, and
it was apparent, in view of the U.S.
stand, that the Latin campaign
would either be dropped outright
or fritter away for lack of sufficient
support.
At the same time the Nether
lands gave the West's first full
dress reply to Russia's bombastic
accusations yesterday that the
United States wants to extend the
war. "The Soviet bloc lias delib
erately closed the door on an ear
ly armistice," Dutch Foreign Min
ister J. II. Luns declared.
"In doing so," he said, "they (the
Russians) have deliberately chosen
to continue the war in Korea; de
liberately chosen to prolong the
sufferings of the Korean people; de
liberately chosen to proceed with
their aggression."
The Dutch delegate urged the
U.N. to stand firm behind India's
Korean peace plan. The Reds have
rejected the Indian proposal be
cause it prevents forcible return
home of prisoners who do not
want to return home.
Russia already has rejected the
Indian plan, which the United
States endorsed, and Soviet For
eign Minister Andrei Y. Vishinsky
declared yesterday that Russia docs
not intend to budge. American
Chief Delegate Henry Cabot Lodge,
Jr said last week the United States
still backs the Indian plan and sees
"liittlc point" in seeking a new one.
