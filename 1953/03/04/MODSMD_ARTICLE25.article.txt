# Cardinals—Recognize Its Function
## 
### 
With the current hub-bub over the varying
heed yell leader proposition changes, the ASSU
Cardinals organization has once again come to
the attention of the student body.
Cardinals is an organization which does
not receive a great deal of publicity in and
of itself, but the accomplishments of this
rjrcxup do not go unnoticed by the student
body— for Cardinals has the job of handling
all ASSU-sponsored, all-campus activities as
designated by the Executive Committee of
the ASSU.
This means that Back to the Farm Week,
Homecoming, and all the acompanying festivi
ties, Big Game Week, Con Home Week—these
activities are arranged and executed by the 14
member committee known as Cardinals.
We have had the oportunity to work on and
with Cardinals this year since the managing
editor of the Daily is ex-officio member of this
group. During our term of office, we learned
how a committee of selectively chosen students
can carry out these all-campus activities credit
ably and effectively.
Cardinals is not an elected organization—it
is a selected organization. Selected not with
prejudice, but with regard to a regular inter
viewing plan and by the use of activity cards
which are filled out by the prospective mem

bers. The selection is made during the Spring
guarter, and the quality of the aspirants is gen
erally tops.
This means that Cardinals as a group is one
of the best administrative groups in the ASSU
—and we feel that this year's membership
lives up to that maxim.
Because the members are interested not only
in Cardinals-sponsored activities, but in the
functions of the ASSU as a whole, Cardinals is
a "thinking organization" —an organization
designed to tackle touchy situations in the stu
dent body and work the problems out. Indica
tive of this the pre-registration committee, now
a separate functioning organization, was devel
oped from a Cardinals idea. And the activities
program scheduled for next quarter in coopera
tion with Alpha Phi Omega is the same type of
situation where Cardinals has seen a need and
is trying to find a solution to the problem.
So when you read of a recommendation or
an activity sponsored by Cardinals, we re
commend that you think twice on it. We have
learned fiom experience that it won't be an
ill-considered notion, but has been discussed
thoughtfully, and at length, by some compe
tent student administrators.- Walt Mennin
