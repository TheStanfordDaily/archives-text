I have a friend. A man among men. A leader of
leaders. The strongest of the strong. A steamshovel
among garden spades. The book among magazines.
Yes, I have a friend. A real friend.
Tie breaks noses at the drop of a pin. He kills at
tin' drop of a hat. He is a tiger. He is my friend.
Everybody thinks my Iriend is wonderful. You
can ;:<>e it in their blank, staring eye sockets. You can
tell it by the carriage of their broken bodies. You
can hear it from their torn and bleeding lips.
My friend is a great man. Most people know he
is a great man and he i.s popular.
My friend is a good man. At the mention of his
name, one's eyes cloud like DDT over a malarial pond.

— — I
My friend is kind and good and wonderful. My friend
is my friend.
Those who haven't met my friend are afraid of
him. he is so great and good. Suspicion seizes their
minds like a boa constrictor. These men are had.
Bad men ask good men (men who know my friend)
why my friend is wonderful.
Good men do not hesitate like men with a three
count hand answering a force bid in spades. They
reply at once like an A student in Civ. They say:
"He is a good man because he is a mysogynist.
He is a great man because he hates women."
Let me give you an example:
The Great Man: (lighting a cigarette with the
nonchalance of a man in a bar on his 21st birthday)
"Hell!"
A beautiful girl: (sidling up to the Great Man and
looking prepared to enact the italicized part of a
Mickey Spillane novel ) "O Great Man, please lower
your seductive eyes into mine."
Man: (speaking like a luger with a .silencer) "To
Hell with you."
Girl: "Please don't hurt, me, but kill me if you
like." (She speaks with the quiet determination of a
person who is minus twenty and in the first day of
exam week.)
Man: "You bore me, woman" (He hits her knee
with his walking stick. The knee cap splinters like
an unpainted floor.)
Girl: (in a voice shaking like a pneumatic ham
mer) "Great Man. ! love you. I love you. I love you."
(Her throat tightens like the muscle around a fresh
bullet wound.)
Man: "I almost care." (He speaks sarcastically,
like an English teacher on the first day of school.)
Girl: "O Great Man, I am dying." (Blood comes
in delicate spurts from her knee and her heart begins
to sound like the tense part of a roulette spin. She
dies, throwing him kisses like Dick Rozek in the first
inning, and then, finally, like Murry Dickson in the
bottom of the fourteenth.)
Man: (looking and speaking like a puppy who has
just bitten a porcupine) "Go to Hell!" (He lights
another cigarette.)
This is a great man. Kind and good and wonderful.

This is a great man. Kind and good and wonderful.

I have a friend. A man among men. A leader of
leaders. The strongest of the strong. A steamshovel
among garden spades. The book among magazines.
Yes, I have a friend. A real friend.
Tie breaks noses at the drop of a pin. He kills at
tin' drop of a hat. He is a tiger. He is my friend.
Everybody thinks my Iriend is wonderful. You
can ;:<>e it in their blank, staring eye sockets. You can
tell it by the carriage of their broken bodies. You
can hear it from their torn and bleeding lips.
My friend is a great man. Most people know he
is a great man and he i.s popular.
My friend is a good man. At the mention of his
name, one's eyes cloud like DDT over a malarial pond.

My friend is kind and good and wonderful. My friend

Those who haven't met my friend are afraid of
him. he is so great and good. Suspicion seizes their
minds like a boa constrictor. These men are had.
Bad men ask good men (men who know my friend)
why my friend is wonderful.
Good men do not hesitate like men with a three
count hand answering a force bid in spades. They
reply at once like an A student in Civ. They say:
"He is a good man because he is a mysogynist.
He is a great man because he hates women."
