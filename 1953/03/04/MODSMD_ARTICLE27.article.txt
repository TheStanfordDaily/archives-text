## A 						Case of Honor 
### 
To the Editor:
I have just been the recipient of a most distressing
piece of news. It was my understanding that last
weekend, at the Military Ball, a person was ejected
on the order of some colonel (I've forgotten his
name) for no other reason than the- fact that he at
tended the function in his Boy Seoul uniform.
As an old scout I must protest ; ivh hiyh-h inded
action! What effrontery! What in. u(Tttable gall! I
am sur. that if the colonel (his name i t : i! escapes rne)
chose to attend a Boy Scout function in his soldier

boy's uniform we would still show him a certain
amount of common decency. No 21-gun salute, mind
you, but at least no insult to his uniform.
In the name of the international brotherhood of
scout-: I demand a public apology from the colonel
(What IS his name?). If that is not forthcoming, then
I will be forced to uphold the honour of the scouting
movement by challenging him to chopsticks at six
paces. If he should accept my challenge, then let him
be assured that I will be the first one to contribute
towards a tomb for the unknown colonel.
