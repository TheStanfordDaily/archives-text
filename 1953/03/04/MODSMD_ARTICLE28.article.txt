# 'Knyght of the Burning Pestle' Re-creates Original Stage Sets
## 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
"Back to the days of Shake
speare" is the motto for the sets
of "The Knyght of the Burning
Postle," the Stanford Players'
production scheduled for tomor
row, Friday, and Saturday at
8:15 p.m. in Memorial Audito
i rium.
The setting for the play is a replica
: of the old Globe Theatre, with au-
I dience galleries, curtained recesses,
! and seats for the audience on the
| stage. Following the Elizabethan
| tradition, the stage has no curtains,
the set protruding beyond the pro
scenium arch.
Since the Globe Theatre perform
ances were solely in the daytime, Dr.
Cole, who is designing and directing
the play, has arranged that there will
be no dimming of lights during the
play, to re-create more fully the
proper atmosphere. As they did in
Shakespeare's time, some members
of the cast will walk into the audi
torium and mingle with the audience.
Costumes for the play, designed
by Miss Opsvig, carry out the gen
oral farcical mood. The characters
in the play proper have their parts
! enhanced by the fanciful creations
designed for them. The spectators
in the boxes and galleries have
costumes which arc faithfully re
created styles.
Commenting on the more colorful
costumes, Miss Opsvig said, "It was
loads of fun making these costumes.
It lets out all the ham in us—we can
use all the colors and materials we
want to and don't ordinarily get a
chance to use."
"The Knyght of the Burning

Pestle" was produced fifty years ago
at Stanford, under the direction of
Professor Lee Bassett, then an in
structor in the English Department.
Personal permission was granted
him by Mrs. Stanford to build
boxes 011 the stage to hold specta
tors for the play. The setting was
the second in America to duplicate
the Shakespearean stage, and at
tracted much attention from news
papers and magazines.
The play itself was received en
thusiastically by audiences through
out the Peninsula. A special per
formance was given at the University
of California, and invitations arrived
from San Francisco and Pasadena.
In reviewing the play, the San
Francisco Call Bulletin commented,
"There is, and should be, much gra
titude going Stanford's way for this
week's opportunities. Not least valu
able among them, of course, was the
chance to see the Elizabethan the
atre, with an Elizabethan drama in
all its pristine simplicity of produc
tion.
"Vastly interesting was the
glimpse of the theatre—with its
'pit' open to the heavens, its side
boxes, its roofed stage, its bugle
tower, its simple setting.''
Professor Bassett, under whose di
rection the original 1903 perform
ance was given, has said of the play,
"I like 'The Knyght of the Burning
Pestle" because it is a combination
of good verse, fine lyrics, lively com
ery, and witty satire. No knowledge
of literature, though, is needed to
enjoy it."
Professor Bassett, along with 14
out of the 52 cast members of the
original production, will attend a
dinner tomorrow commemorating the

50th anniversary of the production.
Tickets for "The Knyght of the
Burning Pestle" are available for $1
at Memorial Hall box office and the
Peninsula box office, DA 2-2122.

Costumes for the play, designed
by Miss Opsvig, carry out the gen
oral farcical mood. The characters
in the play proper have their parts
! enhanced by the fanciful creations
designed for them. The spectators
in the boxes and galleries have
costumes which arc faithfully re
created styles.
Commenting on the more colorful
costumes, Miss Opsvig said, "It was
loads of fun making these costumes.
It lets out all the ham in us—we can
use all the colors and materials we
want to and don't ordinarily get a
chance to use."
"The Knyght of the Burning

Pestle" was produced fifty years ago
at Stanford, under the direction of
Professor Lee Bassett, then an in
structor in the English Department.
Personal permission was granted
him by Mrs. Stanford to build
boxes 011 the stage to hold specta
tors for the play. The setting was
the second in America to duplicate
the Shakespearean stage, and at
tracted much attention from news
papers and magazines.
The play itself was received en
thusiastically by audiences through
out the Peninsula. A special per
formance was given at the University
of California, and invitations arrived
from San Francisco and Pasadena.
In reviewing the play, the San
Francisco Call Bulletin commented,
"There is, and should be, much gra
titude going Stanford's way for this
week's opportunities. Not least valu
able among them, of course, was the
chance to see the Elizabethan the
atre, with an Elizabethan drama in
all its pristine simplicity of produc
tion.
"Vastly interesting was the
glimpse of the theatre—with its
'pit' open to the heavens, its side
boxes, its roofed stage, its bugle
tower, its simple setting.''
Professor Bassett, under whose di
rection the original 1903 perform
ance was given, has said of the play,
"I like 'The Knyght of the Burning
Pestle" because it is a combination
of good verse, fine lyrics, lively com
ery, and witty satire. No knowledge
of literature, though, is needed to
enjoy it."
Professor Bassett, along with 14
out of the 52 cast members of the
original production, will attend a
dinner tomorrow commemorating the

50th anniversary of the production.
Tickets for "The Knyght of the
Burning Pestle" are available for $1
at Memorial Hall box office and the
Peninsula box office, DA 2-2122.
