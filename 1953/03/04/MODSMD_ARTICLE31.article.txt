# Indian Nine Rallies in Late innings To Slam San Jose 7-5 in Sixth Win
## 
### LOU PUJALET 
After spotting San Jose State
a four run lead in the first five
inning of play, Coach Everett
Dean's varsity baseballers had
to put toyether rallies in the sev
enth and eighth innings respec
tively to chalk up a 7-5 win, their
sixth of the season.
Ken Brown, who hurled the final
two frames, was credited with the
win. He allowed one infield single,
walking one, and striking out three.
With the Spartans holding a 5-2
lead going into the bottom of the
seventh, Stanford put together a
three-run rally to knot the score.
Johnny Oldham, starting pitcher
for San Jose, spelled his own doom
when he walked Roger Irviry? and
Dick Cole. Catcher Jack Shepard
waited out a pitch and then sent a
fastball whistling into the outer
depths of the right center, scoring
both runners. Shepard winged home
on an error as the ball was bobbled
by the Spartans' center fielder.
Chuck Essegian came up with
the best play of the game in the
top of the eighth when he cut
down a Spartan run at the plate.
Willi two away and men on lirst
and second, Oldham slashed a
single to left.
Essegian picked the ball up as
Bob Poole, SJS catcher, rounded
third, and let l!y a beautiful one
bounce peg to Shepard that caught

the Spartan runner by five feet.
Stanford scored the winning runs
in their half of the inning as the
Spartan defense fell apart. Two sin

gles, a pair of walks, and three San
Jose miscues pushed across the win
ning markers.
The Indians scored first with a
single taliy in the fir.it on four con
secutive walks by the wild Oldham.
Two unearned runs in the third
and another pair in the fifth along
with another one which was earned
bolted the Spartans into a 5-1 lead.
Dean's stalwarts turned in a
weak deefnsive game, hooting the
hall four times, allowing four un
earned runs to cross the plate.
The Cards were guilty of some
poor base running as well, as men
were caught off base on three oc
casions, costing them at least a
pair of tallies.
First baseman Don Visconti of the
Spartans was taken from the game
with a possible broken arm in the
eighth frame, the victim of a weird
play on which the Indians scored
their winning runs. The sharp-field
ing first sacker fell on his glove arm
while tagging Irvine attempting to
return to first.
San Jose State will play host to
the Indians in a return engagement
Friday afternoon at San Jose's Mu
nicipal Stadium.
