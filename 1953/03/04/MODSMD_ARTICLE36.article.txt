# Broncs, Cards Figure Best in CIBA
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
If the pre-season moans of the
coaches mean anything, and this
year it appears they are all sin
cere, the California Intercolle
giate Baseball Association
should be a hitters' league in
1953.
The wails from the coaches have
n't come from the lack of able and
sturdy batsmen, but from the dearth
of strong-armed hurlers to foil the
hitters.
We've looked at all the releases,
prospecti, and put our ear to the
ground and this is the way the
CIBA shapes up this year as Stan
ford drives for its first title since
1950.
CALIFORNIA
More growls are anticipated in
this edition of the Berkeley Bears
than in 1952, since Cal, although
leading the CIBA in runs scored,
finished in last place. Six of this
year's starting nine were regulars
last season.
Heading the lis) for Clint Evans
is left fielder Tom Keough, one
of the top batsmen in the CIBA
in '52 with .370. Tom is one of
the fastest men in the league and

was an All-America selection last
season.
Other holdovers in the outer gar
den include Caz Munoz in center
and Tommy Pollock in right. Back
in their familiar infield spots are
Pete Krichman at first, Jim Crew at
second, and flashy fielding Dick
Ament at short Third base is still
wide open.
Bob Albo, who hauled down re
bounds with the Cal PCC basketball
champs, is expected to be first
string catcher, with Ray Green han
dling the tools until Bob gets into
shape.
Around the mound is where
Evans is his biggest hunt
in,?. Ed Mayer, the ace of last
year's mound stall', is now in pro
ball, while the service grabbed off
three other top prospects.
Heading the staff at present is
control pitcher A 1 Mathews, who
had a 3-3 record last year. Behind
him are Joe Gaggero and lefty Nate
Short, both lacking experience. An
other possibility is ex-service man
Dave Ackerman.
Sum-up—The big question for
Cal is to see how long it takes
for another pitcher to develop.
They have plenty of hitting, hut
that mound stall" is pretty shaky
and thin.
SANTA CLARA
Bill Prentice's Broncos got the
best shake in the graduation deal
this year as they lost but three reg
ulars and retained their entire
pitching staff
Big noise for the Mission town
team are pitcher-center fielder Dick
Camilli, first baseman Gus Suhr Jr.,
second baseman Ron Moberg, and
shortstop A 1 Bretagna.
Camilli. who was the Broncs'
ace pitcher with a 6-5 mark last
season, was also the team's top
hitter with a .393 mark. He's the
son of the former major league
star Dolph Camilli.
Suhr is also the son of an ex
big league luminary, Gus Suhr.
Gus Jr. hit .290 in '52, while Moberg
swatted .305 last year, including
five homers.
Bretagna was a stickout until he
hurt his ankle early last spring. He
was hitting .583 before the injury.
Lou Lucas is the top man behind
the plate, while Mike Virga and
Kim Nardinelli lead the outfielders.
Rounding out the pitching staff
with Camilli are Don Seybold, Don
Cole, and Pete Zasso. This trio had
a combined 9-5 record last year.
Slim-up—Santa Clara gets the
dark horse nod for the '53 race.
With a little more strength in the
outfield and experience on the
mound they could win the flag.
They will he able to hit with
anyone.
UCLA
Ted Narleski will be somewhere;
that's the safest statement you can
make about Art Reichle's Bruins,
and to be sure it's on Narleski's
small frame that UCLA's hopes rest.
League-leading hitter with .393
in 1951 while playing shortstop,
Narleski slipped to .310 in 1952
when shifted to third base.
This year, tiny Ted has been
moved to second, in order to keep
the bats of shortstop Leo Alarid
and third sackcr I)ick Hansen in
the lineup. Al Bates makes up
the rest of the infield.
In the outer gardens, Reichle has

a top trio paced by Ron Gerst (.338
iri 1952 and 21 league RBl's) in left
and Hal Crow in center, with Frank
Ernaga in right. Jerry Thomas is
the Bruins' catcher.
On the mound, the best UCLA can
come up with is Verlyn Crook,
whoso main claim to fame last sea
son was that he hit a game-winning
homer out of the Sunken Diamond.
Behind Crook are Marty Stiles,
Dick Gilsen, and Ron Zabroski, all
of a pretty unknown quality.
Sum-up — How far the Bruins
go depends on Narleski and his
"comeback" and if they can get
some pitching to keep pace with
the hitting. The Bruins won't lack
for runs, but the hurlers may be
handing them out in bunches.
use
The story down at Troy is where,
oh where have the pitchers gone?
Coach Ron Dedeaux Is faced with
the almost insurmountable problem
of replacing five hurlers who had a
combined 31-11 mark last season.
Gone the way of graduation are
such aces as Tom Lovrich, Jack
Schlarb, Bill Sperling, and Dave
Cesca.
Dedeaux also has quite a hole
left in the infield with the de
parted C'harnofsky twins, short
stop Hal and second sacker Stan.
Catcher Johnny Garten, although
only a frosh, saw plenty of action on
last year's CIBA champs. A fair
hitter, he's a top defensive man.
So u t li p a w Ed Hookstrattcn
leads the large but inexperienced

mound corps. Ed compiled a 5-1
record la ( season with a 11.04
EH A. Dave Rankin, who spar
kled as a soph, Don Young, Ed
Allen, lefty Charlie Mena, Rod
Ristow, and Jack Lovrich, broth
er of Tom, round out the stall"
short on college experience, hut
long on potential.
Only man sure of his job in the
infield is shortstop Johnny Steven
son, who played left field last year.
John drew 39 walks while batting
.284 in 1952.
Lou Bishara, a catcher-outfielder,
and Bill WilLs are fighting it out for
the first-base spot. Bishara seems
to have the edge deefnsively, while
Wills is good hit-no field.
Sum-up—The Trojans seem to
be short on experience all the
way around and it may take them
some time to get started. They
should hit well, hut their chances
to extend their title string to
three in a row are not too prom
ising.
Now after giving you the run
down on the teams, we're going to
stick our neck out and pick the
final standing of the GIBA. Don't
shoot us in May.
