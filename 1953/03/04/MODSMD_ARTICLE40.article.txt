# HAZING THE ROOF
## 
### 
A crack, a scrape, and the tile
covering part of Physics corner
came tumbling down in a shower of
clay and tar paper. Operation re
tile began yesterday morning and
should be completed in about six
weeks, unless overdue rains inter
vene. The old roof had been stand
ing for over 50 years.
