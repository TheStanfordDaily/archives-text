# Mem Church Com Works To Build a Spiritual Hub
## 
### NAN CERINI 
To make Memorial Church the spiritual as well as the physical
center of the campus: this, according to President Herb Long, is
the goal of the Memorial Church Committee. To achieve this aim,
"Mem Church Com" carries on an extensive series of religious and
social activities.
The Sunday Afternoon Club is a public religious discussion

group, which meets Sundays at 4"
p.m. at Bowman Alumni House.
Often there is a well-known speak
er.
Interfaith Council, sponsored by
the committee, is composed of rep
resentatives from Catholic, Protes
tant, Jewish, and Baha'i faiths. At
each of its meetings (all open to
the public) a member presents an
introduction to his faith.
The candlelight service is in Me
morial Church every Wednesday
night at 9. It offers students a half
hour for prayer and meditation,
with a background of organ music
and a short scriptural reading.
In trying to co-ordinate inter
denominational activities, the
committee notifies student de
nominational groups of religious
meetings and discussions of gen
eraf interest. It has also published
Memorial Church News, which
tells of meetings of the Sunday
Afternoon Club and the separate
denominational groups.
To assist Chaplain Minto, the
committee helps inform him of stu
dent reactions, makes suggestions
of people to invite as preachers, and
aids in planning special services,
like the recent 50th anniversary
service.
All these jobs are part of their
promotion of campuswide religious
activity, as are the two problems
they are working on now — wider
campus representation on the com
mittee and sermons with more ap
peal for the student body as a
whole. Subcommittees have been

formed to investigate each of these
problems.
The first of these subcommittees
plans to send its members before
such groups as AWS, IFC, and In
terclub Council, in an attempt to
get fuller area representation on
the committee. Eventually the com
mittee hopes to have a representa
tive from every living group.
Another subcommittee thinks
that sermons will have more ap
peal if there is more continuity
among them. They are working
on a theme, for a quarter or a
year, an aspect of which the guest

preachers may speak on each
Sunday.
Another suggestion is to have the
guest ministers on campus for a
longer period of time, so that more
students can meet them. In line
with this proposal will be the stays
of three distinguished religious
leaders on campus next year: Rev.
George F. MacLeod from Glasgow
(Church of Scotland), Oct. 18 to
Oct. 25; Canon Bryan Green, rector
of Birmingham (Church of Eng- I
land), Feb. 14 to Feb. 18, 1954; and 1
Will Herberg, from New York |
(Jewish writer and lecturer), April j
29 to May 13, 1954.


LEADERS Ot MEM CHURCH COM—John Wennberg, chairman of the committee for sermon
continuity; Joanne Presley, Memorial Church Committee vice-president; Herb Long, president;
and Jim Bowditch, chairman of the Sunday Afternoon Club, look over plans for next year's ac
tivities.
