# Stanford Experts: 'Power Struggle Possible'
## 
### BOB REZAK, BARBARA TUERK HADLEY ROFF 
What would the death of Josef
Stalin mean?
That question was put to five
of Stanford's top Russian ex
perts yesterday by The Daily.
All felt the possible death of
Stalin, leader of an 800,000,000-
man empire, might precipitate a
struggle for power within the
Soviet Union.
Dr. Harold Henry Fisher, head
of the Hoover Library and one of
the country's foremost experts
on world Communism, said, "In
ternally, the Russian people will
have to adjust to the loss of a
man who is 'omniscient' and 'in
fallible.' That's quite a job of
public education."
"The effect will be much
greater on Russia's relations with
Communist countries than with
the Western powers," he said.
"Don't forget, Stalin was not
only the leader of Russia but of
the whole Communist world. . . .
His personal prestige helped to

keep the other Communist lead
ers in hand. . . . Mao Tse-tung
is a much more powerful man in
his own right than any of Sta
lin's possible successors. . . . The
older European Communists are
a whole generation older than
the younger Politburo men. . . .
Few leaders outside Russia are
going to take orders readily from
Malenkov, Molotov, or Beria."
"Whoever gets the prime min
istership (and it'll probably be
Molotov or Malenkov) might get
the job but not the power to go
with it," Fisher concluded. "And
whatever happens Beria will still
control the police."
Dr. Benjamin C. Lippincott of
the Political Science Department
declared that "we shouldn't ex
pect any basic change in policy
as a result of Stalin's incapacita
tion."
"There is too much at stake
for the Communist hierarchy in
general to permit two or three
members of the Politburo to en
gage in fratricidal conflict," he

added.
Dr. Lippincott said he felt it
essentially doesn't matter who
succeeds Stalin since "the Com
munist hierarchy dedicates itself
to world Communism."
Dr. Jack A. Posin, associate
professor of Russian, said he be
lieved Stalin's death would mean
a period of readjustment and a
struggle for power within the
Soviet Union.
"Whoever emerges on top will
try to put his personally loyal
men into power," Dr. Posin said.
And, he added, "there may be a
personal removal of some gen
erals from important posts."
Posin, who was born in Russia,
indicated a possible triumvirate
of power which would be com
posed of the three top-ranking
candidates to succeed Stalin —
Gcorgi Malenkov, Lavrenti Be
ria, and V. M. Molotov.
Should Stalin remain in a pe
riod of lingering illness, Dr. Po
sin said, "the situation would be
much less aggressive. In such a

ca.se, Stalin won't be in power,
and he won't be out of power."
The way in which the an
nouncement of Stalin's illness
as made to the world by Moscow
led Dr. Posin to believe that the
Soviet leader is already dead
and that this is a period of delay.
Dr. Posin said he doubts there
will be any all-out Russian civil
war since there wi |C none follow
ing the death of Lenin 30 years
ago.
Professor Philip W. Buck of
the Political Science Department,
emphasizing that his comments
were based on speculation, said
he felt "Russian leadership will
remain where it is—in the Pre
sidium of the Executive Council
which replaced the Russian Po
litburo last October."
Dr. Buck said he had the "in
clination to think that the popu
lar conception of Stalin as a dic
tator on the whole is a naive con
ception," since "actual decisions
are made by the top leadership
group of which Stalin may or

may not be an influential mem
ber."
Should Stalin's illness prevail
indefinitely, Dr. Buck said he
thought it was conceivable Stalin
might still "continue to exert in
fluence as a symbol with some
body else manipulating the sym
bol."
Commenting on a successor to
Stalin, Dr. Buck said the opinion
seemed to be that Molotov has
passed the power-holding stage
and that Malenkov and Beria,
both young men, would be likely
candidates,
L>r. Thomas A. Bailey, head of
the History Department and au
thor of "America Faces Russia,"
said he guessed that the succes
sor might be more "bellicose"
than Stalin.
He pointed out that most of
the men contending for Stalin's
authority are younger and "per
haps more provincial."
"They might well kick over the
applecart," lie said.
