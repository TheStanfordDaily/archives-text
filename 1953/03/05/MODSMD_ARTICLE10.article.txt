# STALIN'S SUCCESSORS BELIEVED PICKED
## Reports Say Molotov, Malenkov in Command 
### 
LONDON, March 4 (UP)—Official reins keying the control of Russia were reported tonight to
have fallen for the moment from the helpless hands of Josef Stalin into those of V. M. Molotov
and Georgi Malenkov.
Reliable sources reported that Molotov had assumed the functions of acting Premier, and Ma
lenkov had taken over control of the Russian Communist party. There were reports that Stalin

already was dead.
Molotov, Russia's senior vice
minister, was said to have stepped
temporarily into Stalin's govern
mental shoes in keeping with nor
mal procedure in filling a va
cancy in the chairmanship of the
cabinet.
As first secretary of the party's
Central Committee, informants
said, Malcnkov will undertake i<>
manage the party's secretariat and
the party itself.
Whatever the arrangement
brought about by Stalin's grave ill
ness, it was taken by responsible
quarters to be but a prelude to a
great power struggle.
The Central Committee of tl ■
Communist party made it plain that,
the Stalin era was ended, li said
the Soviet people would "realize the
full significance" of his withdrawal
from leadership.
The matter of permanent, succes
sion to the stricken Stalin would bo
decided at a special meeting of the
Central Committee. It would be
convoked if Stalin died or were
deemed permanently incapacitated.
Regarded as ranking candidates
for the permanent succession were
the dish-faced, anti-Western [Mo
lotov, whose participation chilled
many a Bi« Four meeting, and
Malcnkov, the pudgy lieutenant of
Stalin who rose to prominence
during the war as a memliei of
a committee directing the defense
of Russia.
Experts were agreed generally
that the replacement of Stalin couir
be expected to enhance the chance
for continued peace of sorts and eu
down the likelihood of another grea
war, at least for the time beiny
They felt that any permanent suc
cessor would have his hands ful
for a long time getting the interna
house in order, with little time 01
resources for foreign adventure.
Some quarters believed that the
disappearance of Stalin might af
fect. seriously the relations betwi r
Russia and Communist China. Ms-
Tze-tung was known to be sensitive
about his own ideological po.sitior
as head of Asian Communists.
Students of Soviet affairs sair
Stalin almost certainly had writter
a testament naming his successor u
carry out the policies set forth it
his "Economic Problems of the
U.5.5.R.," presented at the Com
munist Party Congress last October
