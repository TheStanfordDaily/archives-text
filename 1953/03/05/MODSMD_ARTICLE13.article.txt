WASHINGTON, March 4 (UP)—
President Eisenhower held a hastily
arranged meeting tonight with Brit
ish Foreign Minister Anthony Eden
and Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles, presumably dealing with
Soviet Premier Josef Stalin's critical
illness.
The White House announced the
urgent conference after Mr. Eisen
hower voiced a prayerful hope that
Russia will turn toward peace.
Some Senators, however, said the
Chief Executive fears Stalin's illness
may foreshadow new Communist
aggression.
Eden, who arrived here late to
day, was not slated to see the Presi
dent until later this week. However,
Stalin's illness and the turmoil it
may portend for the Western world
evidently caused the hurry - up

can leaders.
The President issued a formal
statement wishing "peace and com
rade ship" for the Russian people as
he held an almost continuous round
of conferences with top advisers on
what might happen in the cold war
