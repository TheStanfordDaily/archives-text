"No holds barred"—that's the way Chuck
Taylor wanted the question period in Tuesday
night's Athletic Symposium, but apparently the
student body is either so well acquainted with,
so uninterested in, or so satisfied with its athle
tic program that it has no questions to ask.
After considerable planning and publicity the
Debate society arranged for several members
of the Stanford Athletic Board to appear on the
Symposium in Cubberley Auditiorium, open to
the entire student body.
A 1 Masters, Director of Athletics, was going
to discuss finances where the athletic funds
come from, where they go to, and all the re
lated problems: why no funds for the crew,
why no coach lor wrestling, and so forth.
Chuck Taylor was going to speak from the
coaches' viewpoint and relate his duties and
problems.
fiichard Balch was going to explain the ad
ministration's overall policy on athletics.
Rixford K. Snyder, Stanford's PCC repre
sentative, was going to talk on the subject of
Stanford's membership in the PCC and its im
plications.
Dick Weismann was going to talk on Stan

ford athletics from the student body—the spec
tator —point of view.
Skip Crist was going to evaluate athletics in
the student's life from the athlete's point of
view.
Following this series of four-minute talks
there was to be an audience question period.
The panel had a grade-A membership, and as
far as we were concerned the material was of
grade-A interest.
Yet when the starting time arrived, there
were scarcely 15 persons in the audience,
scarcely a grade-A turnout.
The Symposium had to be canceled, much to
the embarrassment of the Debate Society and
everyone else concerned with it.
But the students who arranged the Sympo
sium have not given up hope. They are re
scheduling the panel for a date in the first two
weeks of next quarter.
Attendance at next quarter's discussion
should provide the final proof of the student
body's interest or apathy toward the athletic
program.
Does Stanford care about its athletics or
doesn't it?
