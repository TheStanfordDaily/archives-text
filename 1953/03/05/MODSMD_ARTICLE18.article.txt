### DICK MALTZMAN 
DATEMANSHIP
(Or 'Hie Art of Making Points without being an Ab
solute Clod )
(With apologies to Stephen Potter, author of
Gatneinanship or The Art of Winning Games Without
Actually Cheating," and Dr. Long, author of "A Sane
Sex Life."
Millions of people have formulated the wish, in
most cases unexpressed, that the philosophy of Test
manship. into which I delved a few short weeks past,

be extended to the more concrete
aspects of campus life. Ably as
si ted by some inebriated com
panions from Pay Station Road,
Yoakle, 1 shall proceed whence
last 1 left you.
Datemanship (or Woomanship
as the great master Stephen Pot
ter, was prone to call it), is a
basicism of the true dateman.
Knowing the modes of attire and
action for every occasion, the

experienced dateman is assured that the eyes of
those around are continually focused upon his per
•'"ii- This is requisite to his success. The Drobney-
Nobbs gamit for bookstore impressions is: rudimen
tary. D-N always carried a packet of y 4" light
pink sheets of paper to stuff into the SffiC) box upon
having. Women loved Drobney-Nobbs as a philan
thropic person.

One-upmanship on his dale is another requirement
ol the seasoned dateman. For the first three dates,
come half an hour late. On the fourth date, come 10
minutes early. Bring a typewriter and proceed to type
out something (anything) that looks like a short story.
When she comes down, ask her to wait until the
letter and story is addressed to the publisher. Insist
upon dropping it ofl' on the way. If the above tech
nique is impossible, the Gubbenheimer "Wait until
I'm done reading this book, dear, it's quite good,"
passes as an admirable substitute.
For the female desirious of being one-up, ask your
<1 te to carry your lipstick, comb, and solid gold com
bination cigarette lighter and holder with the engrav
ing lu Cynthia Irom Charles with all my love."

The datesman's answer, "Oh you won't need these,
I carry an assortment of all shades of lipstick and
my own cigarettes in the car."

Clothesmanship is an essential part of Dateman
ship. Prescribed wear lor all general occasions are
gray flannels arid a Cashmere sweater, worn through
at the arms and slightly torn for that "grad school
look."
For formal wear, a white dinner jacket with con
trasting shades of lipstick stains on the collar gives
that "man of the world" look.
If you are going to your girl's house for dinner,
wear your dress formal. When entering the house,
look quickly at the father in shirtsleeves, give your
best pained expression, and exclaim, "pardon me, 1
seem to be a bit overdressed but I just took it for
granted you dressed for dinner."

"Impress your women with your vvorldliness!" the
great dateman Leopold Funk once wrote. His favorite
cigarette was a Benson and Hodges Russian #5. They
are a half loot long.

Carmanship includes going to the Sunday night
flicks in your roomate's dirty Jag and going to Formals
in your own Model A (always referred in conversa
tion as "Mod. A.") Once in the car, of immediate
importance is Ihe space between yourself and the
party in question. Sanderson Smut and John Charles
Schlep's recent research paper on this subject re
vealed four equally effective approaches to the prob
lem:
1. A five minute dissertation on the danger of
silting in the "death seat."
2. The "You must like the newer cars—their seats
are even wider" ploy.
3. The "Marry me and I'll build a side-car just
for you" ploy.
4. The great approach developed by the famous
Etaoin Shrdul, "Careful of the door, it flies
open!"

And in conclusion, the Bullmanship Session ploy of
the week—wear a Klu-Klux-Klan outfit to your
American Minorities class.
