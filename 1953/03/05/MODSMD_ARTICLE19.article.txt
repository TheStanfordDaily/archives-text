# CAMPUS OPINION
## Confusion in the Ed School 
### 
To the Editor:
Today we went to see our advisor in the education
department and found another new list of require
ments. This list omitted courses we were taking this
quarter solely because they were required. It sub
stituted other courses we have not taken.
Now wc understand why the vast majority of
students in the department condemn it and its dis
organization so bitterly. The classic reply to any
complaint is "If you want to learn to teach go to San
Jose We do not want to leave Stanford, but we do
want to learn to teach and we want to know what is
expected of us.
How ver, the advisors are not kept informed as to
the momentary requirements. We find ourselves
< ither not having the requirement, or wasting time
on unrequired courses, or taking courses for which
we do not have the prerequisites.
Members of the department do not agree on the
answers to such important questions as whether at
tin end of four years a student may receive her B.A.

degree. They make it impossible for the student to
make any intelligent plans for the future.
We recognize good points in the five year program
and we are not condemning this part of the overall
program. However, the faculty refuses to listen to
the legitimate complaints of the students about the
constant changes. Either they leave on an emergency
(at the Cellar) or they laugh. This is why we have
taken the step of wriling the Daily.
