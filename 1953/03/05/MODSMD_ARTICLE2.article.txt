## 
### TED GIESE 
"Our greatest enemy in this coun
try is not Communism or any other
force. It is ignorance. How can
people be expected to make judg
ments unless they know what is
going on in their government?"
Ray Spangler, publisher of the
Redwood City Tribune and speak
er at last night's meeting of the
American Society for Public Ad
ministration on the aspects of se
curity and censorship in President
Truman's 1951 secrecy classifica
tion order, remarked also that
there was a "pretty good case for
the administration in this order."
Truman, according to Spangler,
drafted this comprehensive security
order to remedy a "complete hodge
podge of Army security regula
tions."
When members of the Associated ;
Press Managing Editors' Association '
opposed the order, Truman asked
for their own recommendations on

the problem. None of them wanted
the responsibility of drafting an or
der restricting the publication of
information.
"But the order actually carried
the seeds of its own destruction,"
Spangler continued. "It has had
the unexpected effect of unifying
press and serious students of gov
ernment who believe that the flow
of information to the people is es
sential to good government."
