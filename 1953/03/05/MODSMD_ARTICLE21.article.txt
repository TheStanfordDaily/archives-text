# 'Unique Approach to Criticism'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I bad hoped that Mr. Cubans' repent letter to you
concerning Mr. Ron Rosen's unique ap roath lo music
criticism, a letter well and concisely slated, would be
effective in stimulating a desire fo more intelligent
reviews of Stanford concerts. I read Mr. Rosen's
remarks on the Milhaud concert and my hopes, as
well as Mr. Gullans' letter, seem to hav • been n vain.
The first and most important requisM" of ;■ music
critic is :hat he have a considerable knowledge of
music. ( am sure you wouldn't allow a women's
h hion editor to do the story on an important RCC
basketball game; the result would perhaps approxi
mate Mr. Rosen's review. It is not enough to have a
command of the customary jargon and vapidities:
" l ippy synthesis of the old and the new." "not only
brief, but concise in every detail," "almost reminded
one of Baroque simplicity," "could easily be said to
epitomize the best French .style." This sort of begging
the question, and the chummy sybjective approach

that Mr. Rosen demonstrates has no place in a college
newspaper. What, Mr. Rosen, do you mean by "a very
unusual harmonic structure?"
Not only does Mr. Rosen fall on his face on these
counts, but he displays a lamentable ignorance of the
most rudimentary musical facts. I remember a re
mark in his review of a performance of Hindemith's
Mathis tier Mater suite concerning the "concluding
fugue : any Music 1 alumnus who has looked at
Mathis will be as puzzled as I concerning the location
of this mysterious "fugue."
The audience at the recent Julliard Quartet recital
were as bemused, from my conversations with many
of them, by Mr. Rosen's review of this concert, which
managed to arrive at the correct overall view through
a series of complete mi; understandings, as Mr. Gullans
and I.
Reviewing musical performances is, as I know
from considerable personal experience, no job for
the inexperienced.
