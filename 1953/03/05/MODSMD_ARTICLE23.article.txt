# Red Cross Sets $3,600 Goal For Stanford Community
## 
### WIN GRIFFITH 
With student solicitations completed in the Winter Quarter
Charity Drive, the Palo Alto Red Cross is contacting staff members
and residents of the Stanford community this week and next for
donations to its yearly fund-raising campaign.
Officials of the local chapter have announced a goal of $59,000

for an area which includes Pale*
Alto, Stanford, Los Altos, Mountain
View, and Moffett Field.
Stanford's share in that goal has
been set at $3,600, an amount which
chapter officials expect will be con
tributed by the members of the
"Stanford plant" and the commu
nity.
Where will the money go? What
work will it do?
As budgeted hy the Palo Alto
Chapter Board, headed by for
mer Stanford Registrar J. Pierce
Mitchell. $20,000 will be sent to
the national Red Cross fund for
its work in the United States and
overseas.
But the major portion of local
contributions, approximately two
thirds, will be kept by the local
board for its program in the Palo
Alto Chapter area.
That program, extended since the
end of the last world war to wide
"peacetime activities," is adminis
tered by a staff of over 1,500 work
ers, of which only six are paid and
the rest are volunteers.
This year's program includes not
only the provision of workers and
facilities for blood drives, but ad
vanced services which are available
to every citizen and service man in
the area.
In education, Red Cross con
ducts classes in nutrition and
health, life saving and swimming,
first aid. home nursing, and baby
care. Some of the classes are in
cluded as a part of the curriculum
at Stanford.
In veterans' assistance, the lo
cal chapter offers counseling and
financial aid. motor service, and
provides such equipment as sew
ing machines to veterans and
their families in Stanford Village.
Men in the Palo Alto Veterans'
Hospital are taught by handicraft
skills, entertained by Red Cross
parties and dances, aided in per
sonal problems hy Red Cross so
cial workers, and provided with
individually requested articles of
comfort.
In its work with service men, the
chapter concentrates its efforts on
Moffett Field Naval Air Base and
the service men who are stationed
there or, in "just passing through,"
need some financial or counseling

aid. If a service man has been
brought home from overseas by a
death in his family, a Red Cross
Held director at Moffett Field will
be ready to advance him a loan, help
arrange transportation, and in co
operation with military authorities,
arrange extended leaves of duty.
Such "field directors" are pres
ent in over 2.0(H) Veterans Ad
ministration offices and hospitals
in the United States. A part of
the national budget, the budget
which will include the $20,000
sent by local contributions, helps
to provide these field directors for
their work. In addition the na
tional Red Cross committee par
ticipates in any disaster work
within the United States and co
ordinates the activities of all the
local chapters in the country.
Such international disasters as the
recent Hoods in Europe and the
earthquake in Iran are handled by
the international Red Cross organi
zation operating from its central of
fice in Switzerland.
