# Dealing the Cards
## On Spoils and Things Monetary 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
A word of advice—don't start complaining around A1 Master's office
unless you can afford to make a rather substantial contribution to the
Stanford Athletic fund. It seems we ain't got money.
The sudden realization stems from the fact that we camplained about
the lack o( facilities available to the athlete in minor sports. Main count
on our list was wrestling, a sport rather close to our hearts. Several months
back, before the wrestling season opened, we put our worst foot forward
in our usual pessimistic way and predicted the moon for a promising group
ot grapplers. Coach of the wrestling team is a great guy named Don
Williams, an ex-grappler here himself two years back and at present en
rolled in Stanford's Graduate School of Business.
But Don is a student, and a student in Biz School has just so much
time. When you have a wrestling Phys Ed course of 40 men and a wrestling
team competing in the PCI conference against teams ofthe first water,
you at times lose track of the piles of paper work required for any sport.
And it came about that half an hour before the team left for Cal to
commence the season against the Bears, the Athletic Board declared three
men ineligible for the meet. They forfeited 15 points and still made the meet
close, but we lost to the Bears and what could have been a great season
got off to a shoddy start. And after they returned and hunted up the facts,
it came out that two of the boys had forgotten to fill out their eligibility
card on the back and the third, Phil Wilson, had taken some incompletes
instead of finals and was out for the season. A little paper work just might
have made all the difference in the world.
At first we went in screaming for a full time coach for both soccer and
wrestling, as it seems that both Williams and Leo Weinstein, French
Instructor and Soccer coach, might leave us at the ertd of this year.
Hut as we said, it seems we ain't got money.
Chuck Taylor, the in; n responsible for starting wrestling up again on
the farm after the war, came up with the compromise offer—letting an
assistant football coach handle the paper work on the team and control
the classes, even if the fundamentals and such were taught by grad students.
We think it is a good idea, arid would like to see it tried at least next year.
Football and the Freeloaders
The white hope for a fatter athletic budget is football (it is university
policy not to print the budget, but believe us, it is stretched about as far
as it will go). Football at present is carrying the entire athletic program of
the university, and it is only l>" increasing the take here that is seems
possible to increase facilities at all. "Ach du lieber!" you say, then
why are we playing COP, and San Jose when we could be knocking heads
with some teams that could draw in the big money.
The scream for more intersectionals has been strong around here for
quite a while. Little men keep hopping in and out shouting "UCLA has
three, why can't we until our stomachs turn. Well, for the chronic com
plainers (and we don't say they are wrong) the dawn seems to be finally
arriving. Next season we have the old single with Illinois (away), but come
1954 we meet both Illinois and Navy (both home) and in 1955 we really hit
stride with both Michigan State (away) and Ohio State (here).
O'f course, whether we draw oi not depends on whether we win ball
games or not, but I intend to leave that up to Charles Taylor and Co. In the
iuture, playing two intersectionals on a home and home basis seems the
answer. Any more than one trip East a season tends to cut into scholastic
time.
Crew—Washington's Broke Too
r
And then, while talking of money, we can always throw in a few choice
lines about crew. Jim Fifer, a grad student and one of Stanford's Olympic
entrants last year representing the U.S. in the Pair Oars and Coxswain,
is head coach of the orphans, a gratis position, while freshman coach is
Sam Stearns, but a Senior in the University.
The schedule looks good too, with races against Cal, UCLA, and USC
on tap before their trip east to the Poughkcepsie Regatta. The hoys have
been working on a race with Washington, at Washington, but athletic
director Harvey Cassill of the Huskies seems cold on the idea. Quote
he, "We are working on a shrinking athletic budget and can't aflord the
race." Since when does it cost money to race one's shell on one's own
lake?
Our own shell is filled with veterans from last year. Bill Finlcv. stroke,
Phil West, Jerry Thursby, Ted Cannis, Jerry Thayer. Morgan Sanborn,
Ken Lewis, Bill Allan, and Dixon Smith all went to the Nationals and
Olympic Trials.
