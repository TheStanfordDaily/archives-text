with a 6-2, 6-4 triumph over Ralph
Freund.
Ofiry Gray beat Ives Lametrie in
a thrilling, 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 tight one,
and George Stewart took Bill Lcd
ingham in straight sets, 6-1, 6-3.
This gave the Cards five wins with
only four to go, and the remainder of j
the match was called off.

losses to the Olympic Club and the
Palo Alto Tennis Club, and a victory
