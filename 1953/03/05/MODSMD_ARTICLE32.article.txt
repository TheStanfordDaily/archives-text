"The most beautiful backstroke I j
j have ever seen"â€”that's how Stan- !
i ford's varsity swimming coach, Tom j
i Haynie, describes the form of Larry
Heim, Stanford University swim
mer who holds the Pacific Coast
Conference 200 - yard backstroke
record and placed fourth, in the
National Intercollegiate Champion
ships at Princeton, New Jersey, last !
year, while only a freshman.
"Larry just flows through the wa
ter, even when it looks as though
he is exerting little apparent el- I
fort," says Coach Haynie. "It's un- j
believable."
Last weekend Larry set a new
record for the Encina pool in the
individual medley, lopping almost
a full second off the old record.
He was picked as athlete of the |
week in a poll of the Stanford
Daily sports stall yesterday.
Besides the PCC 200-yard back
stroke record and the interscholastic
record, Larry holds the freshman
National Intercollegiate record for
the same event. Last spring he won
firsts for himself and Stanford in
both the 100- and 200-yard back
stroke events at the PCC Cham
pionships.
When the Indians went East to
the National Intercollegiate Cham
pionships at Princeton last year he
swam the lead-off leg on Stanford's
medley relay that took third, in ad
dition to his fourth in the back- j
stroke.
Before coming to Stanford, :
Larry attended Kcdlands High
School in Southern California.
And before graduating there, he
had already cracked one national
record. In his senior year he
broke the National Interscholastic
100-yard backstroke record with !
a performance that still stands.
"My first serious competition was
in the seventh grade," Larry re
called when asked how long he had
been swimming, "but I started |
swimming long before that, before j
I had a pool to use."
"Larry should make the United
States 1956 Olympic team easily, and
barrng the unforeseen, should be
one of the top backstrokers in the
country in a couple of years," pre
dicts Coach Haynie.
Out of the water, Larry is easy
to meet and easy to talk to. He
is a member of Delta Tau Delta

According to Larry. Coach Haynie
decides what events he should enter.
"I usually don't know what I'll be
swimming much ahead of time," he
says. But this weekend Larry may
try to break the record for the
short-course 200-yard backstroke.


fraternity. As yet he has not
chosen his major field of study.
