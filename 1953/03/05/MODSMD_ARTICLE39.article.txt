# FIRST 'KNYGHT' DIRECTOR
## Dinner to Fete Bassett 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
Professor Lee Emerson Bassett,
who introduced "The Knyght of the
Burning Pestle" in its 1903 perform
ance at Stanford, will be honored
by thf Speech and Drama Depart
ment at a dinner tonight. Other
members of the original cast will
also attend.
In 1903, recalled Bassett in a re
cent interview, the University had
no Speech and Drama Department,
and it fell upon him, an instructor
in the English Department, to direct
the play. Much later, Stanford saw
the need for a Drama Department,
and Bassett became its head.
Bassett's teaching commission,
signed by Mrs. Stanford herself,
started a long career for him at
Stanford, terminating around 1938.
After retirement he worked at the
Max Reinhardt Workshop in Holly

| wood as director of activities. The
Workshop, whose main job was to
train young stars and starlets for
dramatic work, was supported
mainly by the big studios.
One of its pupils, who attained
no sina!! amount of fame in
years, was Jane Russell. "She
was an impossible student," said
Bassett. "We couldn't teach her
anything. Her success in later
years was due solely to herâ€”
physical attributes."
Bassett now lives in Palo Alto,
and occupies himself with his hob
bies of gardening and editing for
publishing 1,000 poems of a former
Stanford student.
He also acts as informal critic
for the Toastmasters' Club, a group
of Palo Alto businessmen who meet
for dinner every Wednesday night
and practice after-dinner speaking.
