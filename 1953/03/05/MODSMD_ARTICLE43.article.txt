# Dorms Await Spring Repairs
## 
### 
Extensive construction and repairs
costing more than $8,000 are in store
for Roble, Toyon, and Stern Halls
over Spring vacation.
At Roble, to alleviate a congested
parking situation at noon time caused
by hashers' cars, the University is
constructing an additional parking
area and a new one-way road. At
the present time the cars of the lunch
hashers block the delivery entrance
to Lagunita Hall, preventing the free
passage of police, fire, and delivery
vehicles.
Also in the spring improvement
plans for Roble is the painting of
corridor 2A.
In Toyon Hall, the biggest amount
of repairs are being done at a cost of
$7,398. The toilet and shower rooms
are being painted and patched up,
while the first floor study room and
game room are to have their floors
refinished and walls painted. New
linoleum is to be installed in thirty
student rooms, and twenty rooms
are to be entirely redone.
Fashionable Stern Hall's shower
door trouble is to be corrected dur
ing vacation. Six hundred sixty-two
dollars will be spent to water-proof
the seams of the glass and metal
baths.
Tentative plans for the painting of
the Physics Building (370-372) are
also scheduled for the spring vaca
tion.
