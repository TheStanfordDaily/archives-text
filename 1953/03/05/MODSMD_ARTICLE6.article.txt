# NSA Topic Of Excom Discussion
## 
### 
Excom in its weekly meeting last
night discussed whether Stanford
should rejoin the National Student
Association.
Present were three student body
presidents of schools belonging to
the Association: Dick Holler of Cal,
Marty Rosen of UCLA, and Lowell
Vye of Mills, who for three hours
answered questions on NSA pro
posed by Excom members and in
terested student spectators.
They said that NSA, working at
regional, national, and interna
tional levels, provides students a
common meeting ground, a central
ized channel of information, and an
instrument for voicing collective
student opinion.
In example, Rosen cited the NSA
National Congress of 1950 at which
college delegates went on the rec
ord as opposing McCarthyism, en
dorsing the principle of federal aid
to education, and favoring draft de
ferments for college students.
(Editor's note: A more complete
run-down on the pros and cons
of Stanford membership in NSA,
as aired at Excom's question ses
sion last night, will appear in to
morrow's Daily.)
