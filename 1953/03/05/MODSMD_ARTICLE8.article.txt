# 'Knyght' Opens Three-Day Run
## 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
The curtain will not go up tonight at 8:15 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium on "The Knyght of the Burning Pestle."
The reason? The set for the play, a replica of the Elizabethian
Globe Theatre, does not use a curtain. Wendell Cole, designer of
the set and director of the play, has done his best to re-create a

genuine Eli/.abethinan atmosphere, ♦
even to the extent of having some
of the east enter the auditorium with
the audience.
The play, a fareial satire, has two J
plots, which intermingle with hi
larious results. An important part
of the action is the audience, which
sits on and around the stage proper
and makes insulting remarks con
cerning the action of the play.
In fact, it is through the efforts of
two members of the audience (Lee |
Martin and Virgina Royce) that the I

name of the play is what it is. They
insist that the apprentice. Ralph (Hal
Burdick, Jr.) be taken into the cast
and be made to perform great deeds
in honor of grocers.
Ralph's adventures mingle with
those of Luce and Jasper (Helen
Davics and Roger Morris), the two
lovers of the play proper, who

finally arc united in spite of the
efforts of Luce's father (James
Rasmusscn) to marry her to a
clowish suitor, Humphrey (Jay
Hern).
Other important characters in the
play arc Master and Mistress Merry
thought (Ron Feinberg and Patricia
Merivale).
Remaining roles are portrayed
by James Barton. F. Ccland Wit
ham, Wallace Whipple. Kenneth
Hirsch, Ward Manning. Jack Frakes
Reinhold Lucke, Jr. Robert Len
ders, Roger Walters.
William Clark. Lynn Ferguson,
Albert Gibson, Nancy McDonald.
Reid Lowden, Anthony Nicholson.
Virginia Stone, and Astrid Wilsrud.

FALLEN HERO Ralph, The Knyght of the Burning Pestle, (Hal
Burdick, Jr.) sprawls ungracefully on the stage after an unsuc
cessful try at gallantry. Regarding him with mingled wonder
and dismay are Humphrey (Jay Hern), Luce (Helen Davies) and
Jasper (Roger Morris). —Daily photo by Glenn Erickson
The curtain will not go up tonight at 8:15 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium on "The Knyght of the Burning Pestle."
The reason? The set for the play, a replica of the Elizabethian
Globe Theatre, does not use a curtain. Wendell Cole, designer of
the set and director of the play, has done his best to re-create a

genuine Eli/.abethinan atmosphere, ♦
even to the extent of having some
of the east enter the auditorium with
the audience.
The play, a fareial satire, has two J
plots, which intermingle with hi
larious results. An important part
of the action is the audience, which
sits on and around the stage proper
and makes insulting remarks con
cerning the action of the play.
In fact, it is through the efforts of
two members of the audience (Lee |
Martin and Virgina Royce) that the I

name of the play is what it is. They
insist that the apprentice. Ralph (Hal
Burdick, Jr.) be taken into the cast
and be made to perform great deeds
in honor of grocers.
Ralph's adventures mingle with
those of Luce and Jasper (Helen
Davics and Roger Morris), the two
lovers of the play proper, who

finally arc united in spite of the
efforts of Luce's father (James
Rasmusscn) to marry her to a
clowish suitor, Humphrey (Jay
Hern).
Other important characters in the
play arc Master and Mistress Merry
thought (Ron Feinberg and Patricia
Merivale).
Remaining roles are portrayed
by James Barton. F. Ccland Wit
ham, Wallace Whipple. Kenneth
Hirsch, Ward Manning. Jack Frakes
Reinhold Lucke, Jr. Robert Len
ders, Roger Walters.
William Clark. Lynn Ferguson,
Albert Gibson, Nancy McDonald.
Reid Lowden, Anthony Nicholson.
Virginia Stone, and Astrid Wilsrud.
