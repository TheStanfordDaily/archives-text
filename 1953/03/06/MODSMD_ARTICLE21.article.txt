## From Another Viewpoint 
### ALFRED R. SUMNER 
(Editor's Note: In today's faculty guest column
Alfred R, Sumner, assistant professor of geography,
takes us behind the scenes of Stanford's current
television series.)

Americans know singularly little about that world
which lies outside of the United States. But for a con
; iderable portion of this world, the United States has
a: umed certain responsibilities, economic and mili
tary, which directly bear upon the security of this
country as well as upon the happiness of hundreds of
millions of other people. This remark will sound fa
miliar to a few people who have struggled through
courses with the writer; but it is his opinion that this
thesis hould be presented to a wide audience, par
ticularly from High School or College.
The idea for a second Stanford television series,
concerned with some of the present trouble spots of the
world upon which Americans as a whole were not in
formed, was submitted to the Ford Foundation and a
Muall sum of money was forthcoming to finance the
operation.
It might possibly be of interest to students to know
ol the extraordinarily fine co-operation which exists
h< ./eon those responsible for producing the series and
the academic people who present the material itself.
Jn particular, Professor Stanley Donner and Professor
fjeorge Willey of the Department ol Sp»'«ch and Drama
have ::hown a remarkable* gra.sp of the subject material
a suddenly presented to them and at the same time
brought the material to the public in what has been
described an interesting and sense-making manner.
J he men at television station KPIX have given this
■'■how far more of their attention and co-operation than
the average "educational" program receives or; a com
mercial station. It is their responsibility to attract the
attention of that fraction of the potential audience
which is interested in learning something. "The fights"
capture most of the people, but apparently at least
120,000 of them follow the Stanford show each Friday
night.
How the producers transform amateurs into reas
onable facsimiles of TV performances is, 1 think, an
interesting procedure.
Take a look at the scene in the studio at KPIX, San
!' rancisco. It is six o'clock Friday afternoon. A group
of three Stanford professors are on stage, but lacking,
perhaps, that assurance with which they face their
captive audiences in the classroom. They rehearse
directly before the cameras the procedure which will
be followed in the show to take place an hour later; they
ai subject to interruption and instruction from an
unseen voice which booms at them over a public ad

dress system. The owner of the voice is Mr. Jim
EaKins, KPIX director. Most tactfully, but firmly, he
directs the performers and guides them into at least
some semblance of desirable television behavior.
Here is a radically different medium for the trans
mission of knowledge and the professor, accustomed
to the classroom, the desk and lectern, the platform
and the blackboard, must learn to do his stuff in a
different manner. Here the wandering up and down,
the stal ing at a remote spot above the students' heads;
the mannerism oi speech and delivery which have
been in the popular fancy the hallmark of a college
professor, do not go.
The story is told not to a living audience nor even
to a quietly dozing one, as in the 1:15 post-pradial
session at Stanford, but rather to one lens of a camera,
that particular camera which presents two shining red
lights as an indication that its baleful gaze is the one
which must be faced by the speaker, since it is the
one at the moment on the air.
It requires a certain effort of the imagination to
envision an audience more than 75 times that which
would fill Mem Aud, at whom the speaker is looking
when he gazes at and through that small piece of
glass. A microphone suspended from a boom above
the speaker's head just out of camera range, picks up
all too faithfully every intonation of his voice.
* In addition the performer realizes that this same
performance is being picked up via kinescope on film,
complete with all (luffs, hesitations, stumblings, grop
ings for words, and other shortcomings which may
exist. The writer found it difficult, for example, to
believe that he had uttered a certain appalling gram
matical error until he saw and heard himself do so
on the film of the show. This is a rather tough
school, but useful one, 1 think, for the professor who,
lost in enchantment over the sound of his own voice
down the years, lias yet to observe himself as his
classes see him.
Friday afternoons offer a pleasant stimulation in
these weeks. There is the opportunity of coming to
know better one's colleagues on the ride to the studio;
there are the boners and apparent disorganization of
the rehearsal.
Then the whole business culminates perhaps in
that moment when the studio clock reads seconds
before 7 o'clock. The visitors have moved into the
control room, the floor director with his head-set and
transmitter holds up his hand for silence, the cameras
are in place, technicians set. The second hand moves
on to 7 o'clock, the floor-man sweeps down his arm
and points at the "voice" (Stu Hyde), and the lines
begin: "That's right; I have no face; I am a voice . . ."
The "show" is on the air.

ol the extraordinarily fine co-operation which exists
h< ./eon those responsible for producing the series and
the academic people who present the material itself.
Jn particular, Professor Stanley Donner and Professor
fjeorge Willey of the Department ol Sp»'«ch and Drama
have ::hown a remarkable* gra.sp of the subject material
a suddenly presented to them and at the same time
brought the material to the public in what has been
described an interesting and sense-making manner.
J he men at television station KPIX have given this
■'■how far more of their attention and co-operation than
the average "educational" program receives or; a com
mercial station. It is their responsibility to attract the
attention of that fraction of the potential audience
which is interested in learning something. "The fights"
capture most of the people, but apparently at least
120,000 of them follow the Stanford show each Friday
night.
How the producers transform amateurs into reas
onable facsimiles of TV performances is, 1 think, an
interesting procedure.
Take a look at the scene in the studio at KPIX, San
!' rancisco. It is six o'clock Friday afternoon. A group
of three Stanford professors are on stage, but lacking,
perhaps, that assurance with which they face their
captive audiences in the classroom. They rehearse
directly before the cameras the procedure which will
be followed in the show to take place an hour later; they
ai subject to interruption and instruction from an
unseen voice which booms at them over a public ad

dress system. The owner of the voice is Mr. Jim
EaKins, KPIX director. Most tactfully, but firmly, he
directs the performers and guides them into at least
some semblance of desirable television behavior.
Here is a radically different medium for the trans
mission of knowledge and the professor, accustomed
to the classroom, the desk and lectern, the platform
and the blackboard, must learn to do his stuff in a
different manner. Here the wandering up and down,
the stal ing at a remote spot above the students' heads;
the mannerism oi speech and delivery which have
been in the popular fancy the hallmark of a college
professor, do not go.
The story is told not to a living audience nor even
to a quietly dozing one, as in the 1:15 post-pradial
session at Stanford, but rather to one lens of a camera,
that particular camera which presents two shining red
lights as an indication that its baleful gaze is the one
which must be faced by the speaker, since it is the
one at the moment on the air.
It requires a certain effort of the imagination to
envision an audience more than 75 times that which
would fill Mem Aud, at whom the speaker is looking
when he gazes at and through that small piece of
glass. A microphone suspended from a boom above
the speaker's head just out of camera range, picks up
all too faithfully every intonation of his voice.
* In addition the performer realizes that this same
performance is being picked up via kinescope on film,
complete with all (luffs, hesitations, stumblings, grop
ings for words, and other shortcomings which may
exist. The writer found it difficult, for example, to
believe that he had uttered a certain appalling gram
matical error until he saw and heard himself do so
on the film of the show. This is a rather tough
school, but useful one, 1 think, for the professor who,
lost in enchantment over the sound of his own voice
down the years, lias yet to observe himself as his
classes see him.
Friday afternoons offer a pleasant stimulation in
these weeks. There is the opportunity of coming to
know better one's colleagues on the ride to the studio;
there are the boners and apparent disorganization of
the rehearsal.
Then the whole business culminates perhaps in
that moment when the studio clock reads seconds
before 7 o'clock. The visitors have moved into the
control room, the floor director with his head-set and
transmitter holds up his hand for silence, the cameras
are in place, technicians set. The second hand moves
on to 7 o'clock, the floor-man sweeps down his arm
and points at the "voice" (Stu Hyde), and the lines
begin: "That's right; I have no face; I am a voice . . ."
The "show" is on the air.

Americans know singularly little about that world

country as well as upon the happiness of hundreds of

courses with the writer; but it is his opinion that this
thesis hould be presented to a wide audience, par
ticularly from High School or College.
The idea for a second Stanford television series,

Take a look at the scene in the studio at KPIX, San
!' rancisco. It is six o'clock Friday afternoon. A group
of three Stanford professors are on stage, but lacking,
perhaps, that assurance with which they face their
captive audiences in the classroom. They rehearse
directly before the cameras the procedure which will
be followed in the show to take place an hour later; they
ai subject to interruption and instruction from an
unseen voice which booms at them over a public ad

dress system. The owner of the voice is Mr. Jim
EaKins, KPIX director. Most tactfully, but firmly, he
directs the performers and guides them into at least
some semblance of desirable television behavior.
Here is a radically different medium for the trans
mission of knowledge and the professor, accustomed
to the classroom, the desk and lectern, the platform
and the blackboard, must learn to do his stuff in a
different manner. Here the wandering up and down,
the stal ing at a remote spot above the students' heads;
the mannerism oi speech and delivery which have
been in the popular fancy the hallmark of a college
professor, do not go.
The story is told not to a living audience nor even
to a quietly dozing one, as in the 1:15 post-pradial
session at Stanford, but rather to one lens of a camera,
that particular camera which presents two shining red
lights as an indication that its baleful gaze is the one
which must be faced by the speaker, since it is the
one at the moment on the air.
It requires a certain effort of the imagination to
envision an audience more than 75 times that which
would fill Mem Aud, at whom the speaker is looking
when he gazes at and through that small piece of
glass. A microphone suspended from a boom above
the speaker's head just out of camera range, picks up
all too faithfully every intonation of his voice.
* In addition the performer realizes that this same
performance is being picked up via kinescope on film,
complete with all (luffs, hesitations, stumblings, grop
ings for words, and other shortcomings which may
exist. The writer found it difficult, for example, to
believe that he had uttered a certain appalling gram
matical error until he saw and heard himself do so
on the film of the show. This is a rather tough
school, but useful one, 1 think, for the professor who,
lost in enchantment over the sound of his own voice
down the years, lias yet to observe himself as his
classes see him.
Friday afternoons offer a pleasant stimulation in
these weeks. There is the opportunity of coming to
know better one's colleagues on the ride to the studio;
there are the boners and apparent disorganization of
the rehearsal.
Then the whole business culminates perhaps in
that moment when the studio clock reads seconds
before 7 o'clock. The visitors have moved into the
control room, the floor director with his head-set and
transmitter holds up his hand for silence, the cameras
are in place, technicians set. The second hand moves
on to 7 o'clock, the floor-man sweeps down his arm
and points at the "voice" (Stu Hyde), and the lines
begin: "That's right; I have no face; I am a voice . . ."
The "show" is on the air.

Alfred R, Sumner, assistant professor of geography,
takes us behind the scenes of Stanford's current
television series.)

Americans know singularly little about that world
which lies outside of the United States. But for a con
; iderable portion of this world, the United States has
a: umed certain responsibilities, economic and mili
tary, which directly bear upon the security of this
country as well as upon the happiness of hundreds of
millions of other people. This remark will sound fa
miliar to a few people who have struggled through
courses with the writer; but it is his opinion that this
thesis hould be presented to a wide audience, par
ticularly from High School or College.
The idea for a second Stanford television series,
concerned with some of the present trouble spots of the
world upon which Americans as a whole were not in
formed, was submitted to the Ford Foundation and a
Muall sum of money was forthcoming to finance the
operation.
It might possibly be of interest to students to know
ol the extraordinarily fine co-operation which exists
h< ./eon those responsible for producing the series and
the academic people who present the material itself.
Jn particular, Professor Stanley Donner and Professor
fjeorge Willey of the Department ol Sp»'«ch and Drama
have ::hown a remarkable* gra.sp of the subject material
a suddenly presented to them and at the same time
brought the material to the public in what has been
described an interesting and sense-making manner.
J he men at television station KPIX have given this
■'■how far more of their attention and co-operation than
the average "educational" program receives or; a com
mercial station. It is their responsibility to attract the
attention of that fraction of the potential audience
which is interested in learning something. "The fights"
capture most of the people, but apparently at least
120,000 of them follow the Stanford show each Friday
night.
How the producers transform amateurs into reas
