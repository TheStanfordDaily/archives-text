And time is growing short here too. This is the last
issue of winter quarter Dailies and there are .several
items to unload.
The first one concerns Mel Bethke, the junior class

< xeom representative who comes
iioiii DiuvJef, Illinois. Mel was
I ruling out in front of the main
libe talking to a girl. It was a
beautiful day and things were
going like things ought to be going
on beautiful days.
Suddenly, an ominous flutter
of wings was heard in the distance.
A distant speck was transformed
into a white seagull. It got closer
and closer and then swooped low

over Mel.
You don't think it's possible, eh?
Neither did Mel. IHt thought it was snowing at first.
