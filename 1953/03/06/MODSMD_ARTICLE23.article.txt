## Let the Africans Decide 
### 
To the Editor:
i' is time the African has benefited from western
civilization as Mr. Hall recently pointed out, but do
the British have to use colonialism as a vehicle for
their beneficiaries? Western civilization and British
Colonialism are not inseparable. Whereas the African
respects western civilization, he is opposed to colonial
ism. By colonialism, I mean an international relation
hip whereby one country being militarily and tech
nologic ally stronger than another, extends its political
and economic control over the weaker one ( without
consent of the inhabitants. Such is the case with the
British in East Africa.
Mr. Hail asks whether the African would have
medical and educational institutions if the British
were not in East Africa. In all the time they have
been in East Africa, the government has not produced
one African professional man among the Africans,
whose population is close to 20,000.000. The profes
sional people they have in East Africa made private
arrangements for their training.
Mr. Allan Root mentioned the East African Ten-
Year Plan which costs the English $43,000,000. He
fails to tell us how much the British take out of East
Africa. Neither does he tell us who are the bene
ficiaries of this fund.
Mr. Root claimed that the British experience in
that area puts them among the world's best author
ities to make decisions on the growth of that area.
I would like to remind him that the Africans have had
longer experience in the area. How about letting them
make the decisions then?
