# Thanks for Berlin Concert
## 
### 
'o the Editor:
As temporary Stanford students from the Free
Iniversity of Berlin we have had the chance to ob
erve and admire the work, thought and the time
/hich was devoted to the organization of the highly
ucce: vful Alec Tompleton concert last Saturday night.
But even more than the organization we appreciate
be spirit and the idea behind it: to help by the
roceeds of this performance young people who are
ur fellow students in Berlin, students who are in
o'ved in the situation .of hardship and difficulty, so
ften described.
It is very encouraging to see that students in more
>rtunate circumstances, enjoying the easier and more
?cure atmosphere which we have been so lucky to
bare for a half a year, do think of their fellow stu
cnts abroad, and do work for people, who study and

live in ;i place of struggle, unbalance, and insecurity
in one ol the danger spots between two contending
ideologies.
We should like wholeheartedly to thank all those
who contributed in the success of the concert and par
ticulrly Joan Marshall, chairman of the concert com
mittee and Keith Nelson, whose committee for the
affiliation between Stanford and Berlin aims con
stantly at keeping a close contact over a distance of
7,000 miles.
