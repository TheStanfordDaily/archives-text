# Corrections
## 
### 
To the Editor:
There were several mistakes in the article report
ing my talk at Stanford Feb. (sth, which I would like
to have corrected.
I said 3.000 East Africans were moved by force to
make room for 13 white settlers. (The article ssid
(8,000 East Africans.) The lands from which my
people were removed were 78.000 acres. The reporter
wrote "shot our people." This is not correct. Some
of my people died as a result of the forced move, but
ihey were not shot. Also my name was printed two
different ways- both incorrect. I hope that these cor
rections can be printed in the paper so that the
students will have a true picture.
I enjoyed very much the opportunity to see the
Stanford University campus and talk with the stu
dents.
