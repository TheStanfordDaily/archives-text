# Ceasefire
## 
### 
To the Editor:
It was a civilized move on the part of Mr. Hall to
suggest that we cease lire until we hear more on
the Wa-Meru case. I even want to go further and
suggest that we terminate the forensic battle alto
gether since the struggle for African liberation will
licit be won in the columns of the Stanford Daily but
rather on the African Veldts. What is more, I think
the world will l>e bettor off in those interested in the
political problems of international significanceâ€”such
as colonialism would cease searching for justifica
tions of their country's stand in the issues involved
and instead help to discover the much-needed solu
tions.
