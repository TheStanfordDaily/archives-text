# Critic Lauds Fine Comedy Of 'Knyght'
## 
### MARY FRAZER Feature Editor, the Daily 
Rarely docs a theatrical group i
present, an almost totally flawless
performance. Last night's opening
of "Knyght of the Burning Pestle,"
however, eminently merited this
distinction.
Hal Burdick Jr. in the title role
is extraordinarily funny as a sa
tirically conceived "protector of fair
damsels." Ronald Feinbcrg's "Mer
rythought," six-feet-seven of Fal
staffian humor, is excellent.
The play's fop, "Humphrey," is ;
most convincingly presented by Jay j
Hern. This part could be the play's j
most difficult, were it not for Hern's j
acute perception of and feeling for
the original conception.
The play's "audience," Virginia
Roycc and Lee Martin as the gro
cer and his wife, send thoroughly
convulsing humor into the
action of the plot.
Space prevents further mention of
individual roles, but the reviewer
found nothing badly done among
them. Major kudos for the produc
tion arc due Wendell Cole, director
and designer, both for his excellent
cast and the use of the original
Elizabethan stage.
"Knyght" might move a bit more
quickly in order to be even more
authentic; it is the reviewer's un
derstanding that the 17th century j
productions catered to contempo
rary taste for even more (and fast
er) slapstick than Cole's direction
allows.
The Beaumont and Fletcher
comedy will run again tonight
and tomorrow at 8:15 in Mem
And. (A special program of bal
ladry and introduction to the play
will take place under the auspices
of Theater Bond tonight.)
"Knyght" is yet another in a
scries of line performances by the
Stanford Players this year, thanks
specifically to Wendell Cole and one
of the year's most able casts.
