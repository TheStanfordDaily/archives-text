## Causes and Consequences of War Studied 
### TED GIESE 
(I'idiior's note: This is the second in a series of three articles 011 the Hoover Library and Institute.)
VVlieii you get to know a little more about the history and purpose of the Hoover Library, you
ilttrally ask whether it contains the largest collection of documents of its kind anywhere in the
orld.
The people who work there will tell you that while it probably does, comparison of such collec
)ii; by mere number is not too significant. It is the unique or irreplaceable quality of parts ol
( >1 lection, and its relation to requirements of the specific work being done, which makes it 1

lportant. They will point out
tit in each such library there
e documents which can be
und nowhere else.
The Library of Congress, and the
•r.Mrj<; ,it Columbia, Harvard, and
i » don, also have documentary
I lections in this country; and
ere ale war collections in the Ro
ns t e m Library near Stuttgart and
e Vineenncs Library near Paris.
The work of the European libra
's was interrupted during the last
w however. And in the other
the basic orientation was not
e same as that of the Hoover Li
ary: toward a specialized collec
m on the causes, course, and con
tinences of World War I.
Nor lias the expansion been
uile so inclusive. Though the
t« 4 vcr Library started by con
rntraiiiig 011 the lirst world war,
has continued to gather on ev
ry subsequent and, in fact, re
ullant movement.
War, revolution, and peace are
e main areas of Library strength,
it'lies in the first and second world
11.-, are concerned mainly with so
il and economic causes, especially
Ih propaganda effects on public
linion.
The field of revolution embraces
e movements of Nationalism, Dc
xraey, Socialism, Communism,
1 v*■ j sm, and Naziism. Studies in
ac.e include a wide range of diplo
-11i«-, cultural, economic, and ad
inistrative aspects of international
ace movements and organizations.
The .specific materials held in
ose 14-story stacks are of stag
ring number:
( 'veriunent documents: 30,000
•ms of debates, legislative acts,
inisterial, departmental, and local
iblicat ions.
Leaks and pamphlets: 100,000
holarly and critical works, mc
oirs, ;snrl works with propaganda
jnificance.
r u papers, magazines, and soci
y publications: 20.000 headings,
>m journals, political parties, un
n . businesses, and 5,000 societies

supporting every conceivable cause.
Posters: 32,000 recruiting, mili
tary, election, and revolutionary
items.
Film: 35-mm. films on activities
of the Commission for Relief in Bel
gium, and a growing microfilm col
lection of documents held else
where.
Currency and medal collection.
Archives: Herbert Hoover's whole
relief and public-office file, located
on the tenth floor; and files of other
relief organizations — one of the
unique collections found nowhere
else.
Special collections: 30U of them

on wartime activities, propaganda,
the Russian Revolution, peace
movements, and social health and
economic problems.
The library adds continually to
this material at a tremendous rate.
Curators of library collections es
tablish and keep up contacts with
government officials and civilians in
their areas who know what type of
materials are needed.
All Stanford students, graduate
or undergraduate, have the privi
lege of using library facilities. All
catalogued material, unless pre
cious and irreplaceable, is circu
lated outside the buildng. Seven

teen * thousand volumes passed
through the hands of students last
year.
"These records . . . embrace the
campaigns of armies, the negotia
tions of statesmen," said Hoover in
his dedication speech.
The records in the Hoover Li
brary are the irreplaceable primary
sources for information on war
propaganda, social movement, revo
lution, and efforts at peace. The
proofs of idealism and trickery
which can serve as examples of ac
tion in forming, in Hoover's words,
"a concept of new human relations
. . . that substitutes peace for war."
How this information is used here
is another story, the story of the
Hoover Institute.
