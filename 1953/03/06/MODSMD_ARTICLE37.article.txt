Memorial Church acquired a "new"
cross Tuesday—a sixteenth century
Byzantine-style crucifix from central
Italy, that has been loaned to the
Church from the Mortimer C. Leven
ritt Collection of Far Eastern and
European Art, which was given to I
the University in 15)41.
The cross is thirty -two inches high J
without a stand, and is made of wood |
covered by a thin sheet of metal,
decorated in flat relief. Red velvet is j
on the back. The central figure of I
the cross is Christ as King.
The arms of the cross have trefoil |
ends, and there is a figure on each:
on the top and the sides are three
gosplers (John, Luke, and Mark)
heads—the eagle, the ox, and the
lion. The bottom figure is the Lamb
of God, symbolic of Christ's suffer
ing.
The new cross, being in Byzantine
style, fits in better with the archi
techture and mozaic decoration of
Memorial Church than did the for
mer one. Since the new one is also
smaller, it does not obscure the ;
mozaic of "The Last Supper" de- j
picled above the altar.
