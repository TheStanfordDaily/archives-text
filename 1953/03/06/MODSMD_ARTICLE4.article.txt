# Malenkov Seems Heir Apparent But Beria, Molotov Still Strong
## 
### HADLEY ROFF Associate Editor, the Daily 
Who will come to power now
that Stalin is dead?
That is the question the world
is asking this morning.
The United Press, in attempts
to answer this dramatic question
has combed carefully every
news announcement from Mos
cow.
And here is how their staff writers
figure it.
G'eorgi Malenkov, first secretary of
the Communist Party, seems the
likely successor. But Viacheslav
Molotov and Lavrenti Bcria, other
long-time Soviet leaders arc not
ruled out.
The hint that Malenkov might be
heir apparent came in the Soviet
Party's first political statement on

Stalin's illness. It "Was published as (
a front page editorial in the oflieial
organ, Pravda, yesterday.
The statement mentioned only
three men by name—Lenin, Stalin,
and Malenkov.
The mention of Malenkov seemed
significant to those familiar with
soviet indirection and innuendo.
However, Molotov, long time for
eign minister of the Soviet Union,
and Bcria still hold prominent and
powerful positions. Molotov has been
named, reliable sources say, acting
premier. Bcria is commander of Rus
sia's Internal Police, the dread MVD.
Who' are these men?
W. A. Ryser of United Press says:
Malenkov—sl year old Communist
has exercised iron-fisted control over
the party. During the war he was a
member of the committee of five
which directed Russia's defense.
His policies—lf he wins a struggle
for power, American and British of
ficials feel he will continue the drive
for world domination laid out by

Stalin. Hul 11 icy believe he, like
Stalin, will :»voir I war if possible.
Molotov—Ho is the best known to
the Western World. He is vice-pre
mier and a member of the Com
munist, Presidium. Before the war
he w;is considered tbe almost certain
heir to Stalin's power.
His policies- Bitterly Anti-west
ern, ultra nationalistic. His accel
eration to power might worsen East-
West relations.
ISoia—The powerful 53-ycar-old
chief of the secret police, all the
Soviet security network, and Russia's
atomic projects. He has the potent
weapon of bis 250,000 agents in a
sort of private army, but there is no
present indication Beria is likely to
make a bid for power.
: His policies—Probably would fol-
I low much Ihn same line as Stalin.
| But little opportunity has arisen for
him to express himself on foreign
affairs since his job has been main
tenance of internal order and party
discipline.

Who will come to power now
that Stalin is dead?
That is the question the world
is asking this morning.
The United Press, in attempts
to answer this dramatic question
has combed carefully every
news announcement from Mos
cow.
And here is how their staff writers
figure it.
G'eorgi Malenkov, first secretary of
the Communist Party, seems the
likely successor. But Viacheslav
Molotov and Lavrenti Bcria, other
long-time Soviet leaders arc not
ruled out.
The hint that Malenkov might be
heir apparent came in the Soviet
Party's first political statement on

Stalin's illness. It "Was published as (
a front page editorial in the oflieial
organ, Pravda, yesterday.
The statement mentioned only
three men by name—Lenin, Stalin,
and Malenkov.
The mention of Malenkov seemed
significant to those familiar with
soviet indirection and innuendo.
However, Molotov, long time for
eign minister of the Soviet Union,
and Bcria still hold prominent and
powerful positions. Molotov has been
named, reliable sources say, acting
premier. Bcria is commander of Rus
sia's Internal Police, the dread MVD.
Who' are these men?
W. A. Ryser of United Press says:
Malenkov—sl year old Communist
has exercised iron-fisted control over
the party. During the war he was a
member of the committee of five
which directed Russia's defense.
His policies—lf he wins a struggle
for power, American and British of
ficials feel he will continue the drive
for world domination laid out by

Stalin. Hul 11 icy believe he, like
Stalin, will :»voir I war if possible.
Molotov—Ho is the best known to
the Western World. He is vice-pre
mier and a member of the Com
munist, Presidium. Before the war
he w;is considered tbe almost certain
heir to Stalin's power.
His policies- Bitterly Anti-west
ern, ultra nationalistic. His accel
eration to power might worsen East-
West relations.
ISoia—The powerful 53-ycar-old
chief of the secret police, all the
Soviet security network, and Russia's
atomic projects. He has the potent
weapon of bis 250,000 agents in a
sort of private army, but there is no
present indication Beria is likely to
make a bid for power.
: His policies—Probably would fol-
I low much Ihn same line as Stalin.
| But little opportunity has arisen for
him to express himself on foreign
affairs since his job has been main
tenance of internal order and party
discipline.
