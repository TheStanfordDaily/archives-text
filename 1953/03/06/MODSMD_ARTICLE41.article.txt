# Ruggers Vie With Bears On Satuday
## 
### JACK RANNELLS 
It's the week of the "Bicj Si urn."
And the big serum it has been all
week out on the Stanford practice
rugby field for Pete Kmetovic and
his forty rugby warriors. Still smart
ing from the 6-3 pawing hunded them
by the Bruins of UCLA, the Indians
have fallen hack to home ground,
which they hope to pretect from the
very-potent California Bears tomor
row. Starting time is 2:30.
Down in the southland it was not
enough accuracy on the penalty kicks
and an inept oflense that sent the
Indians scurrying away licking their
wounds. And so, such emphasis has
been put on both departments during
the past week.
Wingbaeks Fletcher Metten and
Dorsey Atkinson have been attempt
ing virtually all their penalty kicks
and points after try (touchdown)
from diflicult angles to get their eyes
zeroed in to eliminate any chance
of repetition of last Saturday's loss.
Both the varsity and JV backfields
have been running harder this past
j week also, as Billy Heilbron, Hon
Cook, Atkinson, Sam Morley, Bud
Carr, and Jack Lewis have been
grinding off long gainers. The ener
getic play of the past week has not
been without cost though, as break
away Derek Howard and scrum half
Bill Gary will both miss tomorrow's
game. Howard's shoes will be filled
by Paul Revak, guard of the foot
ball team, and Gordy Warnock will
play the halfback position.
The defense hasn't been slighted,
either by Kmetovic, for coach Miles
Hudson of the Bears has an offensive
that can't be neglected. Gone is Les
Richter, scoring machine of last year,
but bqck are his old mates Max
Howell and Bob Brooks and new
comer Gerald Perry.
Howell, by the way, is rated by
many a greater rugby player than
Big Les ever was. From Sydney,
Australia, he has grown up with the
game and seems to instinctively know
just when and where to run, punt,
or drop-kick. And he usually does it.
