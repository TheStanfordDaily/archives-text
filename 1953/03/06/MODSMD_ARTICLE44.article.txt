# TRACK DEBUT
## '53 Cinder Season Opens at Fresno 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
While 7,000 and some Stanfordites are basking in the Balboa,
etc., sun, 26 and some Stanford trackmen will be working out in
the familiar confines of Angell Field, waiting for March '28 and
the first meet of the season with Fresno State at Fresno.
Fresno is an unknown guantity as far as the track world is

concerned, and shouldn't be able to
field the first-rate competition in
every event that Stanford's later
opponents will.
Leading the Stanford attack will
be the ever-present name of Rob
ert Mathias (discus, shot, hur
dles), ably assisted by such excel
lent men as Bob Simon (880, mile,

two-mile), Bob Reed (mile, two
mile), Maury Parsons and Keith
Brownsberger (sprints), Leo Long
and Chuck Kimball (javelin),
Howie Hertz (shot and discus),
and more.
That old devil, the cold germ, has
held the team down in practice so
far this season, but Brownsberger
in the sprints and Simon, Reed, and
Russ Ferguson in the distances have
been looking good in time trials/
Simon has clocked a :5G quarter,
1:54.8 half. 4:21.9 mile, and 9:27.5
two-mile. , Ferguson made headlines
two weeks back by clocking oft a
9:36 to knock 35 seconds off his pre
vious best. Reed has been running
shorter distances because of a bad
toe, but is finally back in shape.
In the sprints, Bob Magee has
been nursing Tilmself back into
shape while Brownsberger and Par
sons have been fighting it out for
the top sprinter. Brownsberger's
finish has given him the inside track
so far, with time trial bests of 9.9
and 22.
In the javelin, both Long and
Kimball have been cracking the
190 mark. In the shot, Mathias,
now a solid 210 pounds, has been
topping 50 feet consistently, with
Hertz holding his own about 51
feet.
Neither Mathias nor Chuck Ren
fro seems to be hitting stride, as
both are flipping the platter about
150 feet.
Two sophomores, Walt Garrett
and Rich Black, seem to be moving
out veterans Fred George and Bill
Friedrichs in the quarter in early
season time trials.
