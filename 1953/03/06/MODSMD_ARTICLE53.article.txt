# NINE GAMES
## Baseballers Play Full Holiday Slate 
### DON WEBSTER 
Stanford's undefeated varsity baseball team plays nine games
over the spring vacation, ranging from triple-A clubs to junior
colleges. And yet their contest this Saturday may prove to be
the ioughest all season.
After a game this afternoon at San Jose State, the Cards face

Fort Ord tomorrow at 2:o0 p.m.
porting a hast of ex-major and
minor league stars, the service team
mi«ht well give the Indian nine
their first defeat of the season.
Using their ace hurler, John Old
ham, San Jose State lost to Stan
ford, 7-5, last Tuesday. Actually,
the game should not have been that
close, for a pair of errors gave the
Spartans four of their live tallies.
And without their ace on the hill
they shouldn't be too tough an op
ponent for the varsity, who play
j their first visting game of the year
|in that contest. Ron KaufTman is
presently scheduled to hurl against
Stanford'*, Mike Acker.
The Fort Ord team is headed by
Tommy Morgan, property of the
New York Yankees. Hie young
futvler was outstanding in a few
appearances before he was draft
ed. At first base is J. W. Porter,
a $(>(1,0(10 bonus baby, who is cur
rently the property of the Detroit
Tigers. Earlier this season Porter,
playing for the Berkovieh team,
hit the first Sunken Diamond
homer of the season. All in all, he
had three-for-three in the contest
that ended an 11-11 tie.
Next Monday the Cards face the
| Sacramento Solons. Though the
triple-A teams are strong, they usu-
I ally have an inexperienced hurler
or two trying out on the mound,
1 so the opponents often have a good
1 chance of victory.
The week after school is out, the
i varsity playd six games in eight
! dnys. The Saturday following finals
j see the Oakland Oaks at the Sunk
| en Diamond. On Monday, Tuesday,
! and Wednesday the San Francisco
j Seals, Alameda Coast Guard, and
i Cal Poly face the Indian nine, all
j games at Stanford.
The Cards open league play as
they travel to lx>s Angeles to face
USC in contests on Friday and
Saturday. For Stanford rooters
living in Southern California, the
games are set for Bovard Field at
2::i0 p.m.

Stanford's undefeated varsity baseball team plays nine games
over the spring vacation, ranging from triple-A clubs to junior
colleges. And yet their contest this Saturday may prove to be
the ioughest all season.
After a game this afternoon at San Jose State, the Cards face

Fort Ord tomorrow at 2:o0 p.m.
porting a hast of ex-major and
minor league stars, the service team
mi«ht well give the Indian nine
their first defeat of the season.
Using their ace hurler, John Old
ham, San Jose State lost to Stan
ford, 7-5, last Tuesday. Actually,
the game should not have been that
close, for a pair of errors gave the
Spartans four of their live tallies.
And without their ace on the hill
they shouldn't be too tough an op
ponent for the varsity, who play
j their first visting game of the year
|in that contest. Ron KaufTman is
presently scheduled to hurl against
Stanford'*, Mike Acker.
The Fort Ord team is headed by
Tommy Morgan, property of the
New York Yankees. Hie young
futvler was outstanding in a few
appearances before he was draft
ed. At first base is J. W. Porter,
a $(>(1,0(10 bonus baby, who is cur
rently the property of the Detroit
Tigers. Earlier this season Porter,
playing for the Berkovieh team,
hit the first Sunken Diamond
homer of the season. All in all, he
had three-for-three in the contest
that ended an 11-11 tie.
Next Monday the Cards face the
| Sacramento Solons. Though the
triple-A teams are strong, they usu-
I ally have an inexperienced hurler
or two trying out on the mound,
1 so the opponents often have a good
1 chance of victory.
The week after school is out, the
i varsity playd six games in eight
! dnys. The Saturday following finals
j see the Oakland Oaks at the Sunk
| en Diamond. On Monday, Tuesday,
! and Wednesday the San Francisco
j Seals, Alameda Coast Guard, and
i Cal Poly face the Indian nine, all
j games at Stanford.
The Cards open league play as
they travel to lx>s Angeles to face
USC in contests on Friday and
Saturday. For Stanford rooters
living in Southern California, the
games are set for Bovard Field at
2::i0 p.m.
