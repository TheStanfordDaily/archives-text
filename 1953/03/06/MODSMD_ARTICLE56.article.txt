One cylinder of the Stanford
wrestling machine will enplane for
the Southland, cither San ui
San Luis Obispo, for the Pacilic
Coast Intel scholastic Wrestling
Tournament next week, but chances
for league honors seems slight.
Bob Beatie, 177, was expected to
go, but he pulled some ligaments in
his leg in the Cal meet. Beatie was
injured in the lir.it period, but
wouldn't heed the advice ol doctors
to quit and went on to take a three
point decisionâ€”more than the win
ning margin.
George Russell, Stanford's un
beaten and once-tied 137-pound ter
ror, may be another injury. Rus
sell, wrestling over half the season
with a bad side, is having his rib
X-rayed to see if he will be in
shape to go.
Definitely going will be Ken
James at 157 and Jack Ogelsby at
1(17. Ogelsby, team captain, was
third at 177 last year, and hopes to
move up.
Plans originally called for the
meet to be held in S.m Diego by
San Diego State, but a tie-up on
plans might lead to a shift to San
Luis Obispo, where Cal Poly has
ottered to host the finals.
