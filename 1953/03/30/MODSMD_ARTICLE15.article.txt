# NEW DORMS TO BE CONSTRUCTED
## New Encina Included In $9,000,000 Project 
### 
«1
A new Encina which will house 680 men is being planned for
the vacant area across from Branner Hall as part ol the University's
$9,000,000 major dormitory building program. Construction should
be completed in 1954.
Site surveys are now being completed on the lot. Estimated

cost of the new building i.s $3,500,000,
which includes all furnishing, land- j
scaping, and equipping needs.
A low-cost remodeling job will
convert the present Eneina into an
administrative and research building.
University officials said that the cost
of turning Encina into a modern
dormitory would be much higher
than the results would justify.
A second major construction job
will be a new women's residence in
front of the Knoll, formerly the resi
dence of Dr. and Mrs. Ray Lyman
Wilbur. The proposed building will
accomodate 500 students at a cost of
nearly $15,000,000. When it i.s com
pleted, Brainier will be returned to
the men. Construction will be start-
I ed when funds become available.
A third plan involves a $1,750,000
| addition to Stern Hall which would
house 414 men. A final building
| plan is a graduate men's dormi
tory in the area between Crothers
llall and Toyon. Both of these
arc in the "indefinite future" cate
gory.
Aproximately 40 percent of the
building costs will come from en
dowments. The remaining 60 per
cent — or almost $6,000,000 must

come from gifts. University officials
are now working on a gift program
which will provide the necessary
funds.
At the present time 3,024 studen ,
are living on campus in University
residences and fraternities. The n\
of the 7,000 students currently en -
rolled at Stanford live in homes and
rooming houses ranging from San
Francisco to San Jose.
Encina first opened its doors in
the fall of 18! M, the first yuar tin-
University was open. The original
Roble, now Sequoia, is no longer
used as a student residence. The
present Roble was constructed
after World War I to hold .'OH
freshman girls. Brainier and Toy
yon were added a few years later.
To accomodate the post war flood,
of GI students, the University leased
Stanford Village from the govern
ment. Stern Hall was built in 1040
and Crothers was added in 1951 to
accomodatc 143 law students.
More information on the building
program will be given out this quar -
ter by ''Stanford—Today and To
morrow," the new student informa
tion program.
