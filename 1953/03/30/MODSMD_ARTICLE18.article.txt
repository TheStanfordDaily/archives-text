# The
						Spring Quarter Roller Coaster
## 
### 
As the rollercoaster creeps to the top of the
last long incline and heads for the finish of its
crazy dash up and down and around its twist
ing curves, so the 1952-53 year has reached
Spring Quarter.
For some, it will be the last lap of the last
ride. Maybe it will be just another guarter.
Maybe it will be a guarter of champing at the
bit, waiting to heave a tremendous sigh of re
lief when graduation day rolls around. Maybe
it will even be tinged v/ith a bit of sentimen
tality, especially at the end.
For others it will be the first spring quarter
at Stanford. Tt will be the first time for ex
periencing classes in Frost Amphitheater

(Some profesors are just as eager for the sun as
their students). It will be the first quarter of
sunny Friday afternoons at Rossotti's, of twi
light beach parties, of Eob Mathias track per
formances, of a championship baseball and
swimming team.
For the rest the balancing middle class,
by far the biggest proportion of our Stanford
Community it v/ill be the usual spring quarter,
perennially the best quarter on the Farm.
To all we say sit down, enjoy the ride, live
it up to the fullest, but live wisely; don't get
overly thrilled by the Big Time, so that you
stand up, and run the risk of getting tossed off
the fast-paced vehicle.
