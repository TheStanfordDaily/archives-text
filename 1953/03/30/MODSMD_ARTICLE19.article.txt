# CAMPUS OPINION
## Honor Code Violations 
### 
To the Editor:
I am a freshman, and, as all freshmen wore, I
was firmly indoctrinated with Stanford spirit, Stan
ford traditions, and the Fundamental Standard upon
my arrival at this university. I gave myself credit
for not being unreasonably idealistic. I must, I
suppose, accept the well-known violations of our
Fundamental Standard such as liquor in fraternity
houses. But I still expect the students of this school
to maintain a personal honesty in their academic
activities.
In (he past two quarters I have heard of at least
three instances of books stolen from the Western
Civilization library. These were books which had
been returned either in the appropriate chute or
through the slot in the door which is to be used before
the library opens. Their former borrowers were
astonished to receive a curt postcard stating: "You
are being charged at the rate of twenty-five cents
an hour for an overdue book." And they were even
more astonished to discover that they had to pay for
the missing books which they had conscientiously re
turned.
Accepting th< fact that the Western Civilization
library is not .structurally burglar-proof, we must, as
in most situations at Stanford, rely on the individual's
honor. On registration day we signed not only the
Honor Code but also a library card stating that we
would apply the Honor Code to the use and borrowing
of all books.

In the leaflet published by the Honor Code Stand
ing Committee I found this sentence: "Personal honor
plays a large part in the lives of Stanford men and
women; many ordinary precautions, restrictions,
and regulations are not necessary because of the ex
tent to which trustworthiness and self-discipline are
exhibited here.'' Can we prove this statement or
must we have more strongly built and more strictly
administered libraries? How much docs our Honor
Code mean to each one of us? Instances such as the
ones I have presented weaken our basic system and
our respect for that system. Let us do something
about it.
