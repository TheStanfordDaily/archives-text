To the Editor:
Some kind and thoughtful person sent me a copy
ol The Stanford J)ail\ for Monday, February 16,
19515. 1 was very much touched by your kind reference
to me :ii!<! by your reprinting of that little article I
wrote for the Stanford Review. May I take this
occasion to ay how pleased I am that Excom passed
a m olution «• ipporting the old traditions. They may
be. 1 , ;.nd pi'obably are, foolish, but it is amazing how
many very precious things are very foolish.
LAWRENCE A. KIMPTON
