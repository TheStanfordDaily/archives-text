# Indians Win 2'Game Trojan Series
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
The Stanford baseball team got off to a fast start in CIBA play
this weekend as they defeated six USC pitchers, two umpires,
and an outclassed Trojan nine 7-1 Friday and 5-2 Saturday.
Though the Indians won the pair of contests with apparent ease
they insisted on keeping fans tense by waiting until the later in-

rungs to score. Three big homers
helped the Indian cause as Chuck
Essegian hit a grand-slam homer
in the first game and Jack Shepard
and Ray Swarts each slammed a
four-master in the sixth inning of
the Saturday tilt.
Bob Murphy went the distance in
the initial contest, allowing only
four hits. He was hindered by a
lack of control, and the umpires did
not help this any either. Appar
ently the pair of arbiters are well
known to Southern California fans,
for they are called "Glass - Eye
Widner" and "Guide-Dog Blume."
After the Indians had scored on
a walk and a pair of singles in the
third inning, Shepard came to bat
with men on second and third and
two outs. He was called out on a
called third strike that seemed out
side and low to everyone in the
park but the umpire. It was only
the second time this season that
the big catcher has whiffed, the
other time being against Bill Boem
ler of the Seals.
The Trojans tied the game in the
last of the inning when Murphy
walked the bases full. With two
out and a full count on the batter,
the umpire let a seemingly perfect
pitch force in a run. With the de
cision, Shepard whirled around and
Murphy came charging oil the hill,
but fortunately cooler heads pre
vailed.
The game remained tied until the
seventh, when USC forced a run
across the plate themselves, fol
lowing two other walks and a sin
gle. Then Essegian lengthened the
Stanford lead with his 37(5 - foot
blast to left-center field. Still an
other insurance run was added in
the ninth on a pair of singles and
a double-play ball that was too
late reaching first.
Phil Page started the second game
but had to be relieved in the fourth
when he walked a run in. Ken
Brown finished the game for Stan
ford.
With the hosts ahead, 2-1, in the
sixth, Shepard came to bat and tied
the game with his home run. Esse
gian then batted and landed on
second when his scorching drive
almost took the left fielder's glove
off. Swarts then added his four
master and the game was settled
once and for all.
Another tally came in the eighth
on an erf or, a single, and a double
by Shepard.
Three USC hurlers were used in
each game, all having near-equal
effectiveness as far as Stanford
was concerned,
Here's how Stanford fared dur
ing the vacation.
SAN JOSE STATE
A! Talboy and Jack Shepard led
the Cards to their second victory
over the highly touted Spartans.
Talboy got four for four, as the
Cards blasted their way to an 11-6
win.
FORT ORD
The Stanford baseball team suf
fered their first defeat of the year
as they were 'edged by Fort Ord,
5-3. But it took a ninth-inning
homer and a major league pitcher
to do it.
Leading by a 3-2 count in the
top of the ninth, Phil Page gave
up a single to Gene Klinger.
property of the Seals, an infield
bunt hit to Lou Hannah, prop
erty of Seattle, and then faced
Tomy Morgan, property of the
New York Yankees.
Morgan, who had relieved for
Fort Ord in the eighth, hit a homer
over the left field wall, and then
proceeded to shut out the varsity
in the ninth to win the game for
the visitors almost single-handed.
SACRAMENTO
Perhaps both the most thrilling
and most impressive game of the
Indians during the past few weeks
was the game against the Solons.
Bob Murphy battled against three
Senator hurlers to a 1-1 tie. Stan
ford's tally came in fV ,the eighth on
a bunt by Rich Scrnmaglia, an ad
vance to second on ai£*error, and
a solid blow by catcher Jack Shep
ard.
The trio of visiting hurlers in
cluded Kog Osenbaugh, former
Stanford star; ex - big - leaguer
Marino Pieretti; and Charlie

Schanz. a former 20-gam*' winner
in the PCL and Boston Red Sox
hnrler.
OAKLAND
Climaxed by Chuck Essegian's
first home run of the year, the In
dians next downed Oakland, 4-3, in
ten innings. With Bob Murphy
again going the distance, the Stan
ford nine made the most of the nine
hits garnered off' Accrn hurler
! Charlie Beamon. Essegian's blow
| came in the eighth frame, and gave
Stanford a 3-2 lead. After the Oak
! landers tied the game in the ninth.
| they were defeated by a walk to

tne winning score when the left
fielder dropped Chuck Essegian's
I fly ball.
SAN FRANCISCO
The Seals provided Stanford
with their second loss of the sea
j son, downing them by a 5-3
count. Though the visiting PCL
i club was; outhit, they made the
most of ten bases on balls given
up by lefty Phil Page. Ken Brown
hurled the last two frames for
Stanford. A pair of singles by
first sacker Hal Ilennacy anil two
by third baseman Ray Swarts
helped Stanford in scoring their
trio of tallies.
ALAMEDA COAST GUARD
After the game with the Seals the
previous day, which they were
"high" for, the varsity suffered a
drop of spirit as they rolled over
and played dead to the Alameda
i Coast Guard, 7-1.
It looked as if the Indians
would suffer their first shutout
of the season until the eighth in
ning, when a walk, a single, and
another liner by Jack Shepard
gave them their lone tally. Mike
Acker hurled the first eight
frames and was relieved by Bob
Murphy in the ninth. A number
of the visiting players were for
mer CIBA stars.
CAL POLY
Bouncing back from the previous
day's trouncing, the varsity did
some trouncing themselves, as they
overpowered a hapless Cal Poly
nine, 10-3. Included in the 11 hits
for Stanford were a pair of triples
to Shepard, crediting him with two
more RBl's and giving a total of
I 23 for the season, as many runs bat
! Led in as hits.
Don DeLong started for the In
j dians and hurled -ix innings. Mean
-1 while, the hitters were busy scor
i ; ng eight runs in the first three
j frames. The team then stopped car-
I ing. Gil Duncan, Phil Page, and
| Ken Brown each threw one inning.
Counting Stanford's wins over
USC, the team's record is now
ten won. three lost, and two tied.
