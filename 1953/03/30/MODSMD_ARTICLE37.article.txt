Stanford's crew swept to a j
length victory over Oreeon State
I last Wednesday at the Palo Alto
Yacht Harbor.
The Indian boat, manned largely
by reserves, churned over the 2000
meter course in 7:41.5. The Beavers,
who took an early lead only to re
linquish it after 400 meters, were
clocked at 7:55.5.
