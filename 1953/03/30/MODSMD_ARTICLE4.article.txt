### 
WASHINGTON â€” Sen. Karl E.
Mundt (R., S.D.) said today Greek
ship owners agreed to halt trade
with Communist countries in return
for a promise by Senate investiga
tors not to "harass them" by "rak
ing off stull in their past."
Mundt referred to Sen. Joseph R.
McCarthy's announcement Satur
day that Greek owners of 242 mer
chant ships have agreed to cut off
trade with North Korea, Commu
nist China, and Soviet Far Eastern
ports. McCarthy said '"We've prom
ised them nothing."
The State Department and other
government agencies concerned
with problems of trade behind the
Iron Curtain were studiously silent
about McCarthy's venture into di
plomacy.
