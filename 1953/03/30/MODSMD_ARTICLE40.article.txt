# Free Berlin Student Visitors Give Final Impression of Stanford
## 
### BARBARA TUERK 
(Ho Rosenfeld, Inge Krauss, |
Rudy Geissler, Kurt lleilmaiiii,
and Kate Asmuss left Stanford
during spring vacation. Daily
Night ICditor Tuerk interviewed
them just before they left.)

There are five of them, and

i together they can dissect a
| school's government in less time
than it takes to say "Auf Wieder-
I sehen."
Ro Rosenfeld, Inge Krauss, Rudy
j Geissler, and Kurt Heilmann are
1 students at the Free University of

Berlin; and Kate Astnuss is associ
ate professor of Asiatic and Slavic
languages at their university. They
have been at Stanford for two
quarters on a State Department
grant to study student government
at one of the schools where it is
best developed.
"I can't believe we're leaving. It
seems we've been here all our
lives," brown - eyed Inge half
laughs, half moans.
Not that they mind living in the
strategic island of Berlin. "In fact,"
Inge laughs, "when we're home it
doesn't seem so dangerous. It's
when we're in California that
things seem bad in Berlin. Actu
ally living in Berlin is a wonderful
experience — people standing to
gether, and helping each other
out."
"As long as the Western powers
stay, we'll be all right," Kurt be
lieves. "We need them. Bcrlincrs
feel much more preoccupation
than the rest of Germany."
"Of course, we'd like to see the
Americans leave if there were no
Russians. It's been eight years,
and still we're not back to nor
mal. But that's just idealistic and
unrealistic," Inge adds.
One of the major jobs of the Free
University's student government is
to help out the 40 per cent of the
students who come from the East
Zone.
"Everyone from the Soviet zone
gets a scholarship £rom the city,
private individuals, or the Bonn

government," Ro points out.
The students come from the East
Zone knowing that they can never
go back.
"It's a crime to go to the uni
versity," Ko explains. "You lose
your identification cards and your
citizenship."
"Yes, we're a capitalistic, war
m on g e r in g institution," Inge
laughs again,
"The Communists don't even try
to make propaganda at the Free
University," Rudy breaks in. "They
spread their pamphlets at every
other university in Germany, but
here they don't even try. They
know it's hopeless."
Kate believes that you can't com
pare anything about Stanford and
Berlin except that they both have
students, professors, books, and
classrooms.
The others disagree. Both schools
have active student governments.
They are different, of course.
For one thing, Berlin students
participate in almost every ad
ministrative decision. "We even
have two students who help to
elect the president," Ro elabo
rates.
"Another obvious difference is
that our university has no campus,"
Kurt says.
"The whole residential system
breaks down," Inge continues.
"Yes, our legislative body has to
represent academic departments in
stead of living areas," Rudy addds.
"And we don't have all this stress

on committees and group work,"
Kate says. "Our students live and
study on their own. Personally, I
like this concentration around de
partments and common interest in
a subject, rather than the social
stress."
But the students like the social
stress. "You meet only on an aca
demic level iii Berlin," Kurt ex
plains. "The students there arc
more formal, more reserved,
harder to get to know."
"For instance, they call each oth
er 'Mr.'," Rudy chips in.
"But it makes friendship more
meaningful, when you wait before
using first names," Kate insists.
"The one thing I won't bring back
are the blind dates," Rudy declares
in his positive way. "Our girls
would kill me. Do you know my
first impression of Roble? — they
stand in line for dates. We walked
in and said we needed five; they
asked 'How tall?'"
There are lots of ideas they will
take back to Berlin from Stanford.
Kurt has worked with Encina .spon
sors and Pre-Reg, and is hoping
to initiate some kind of orientation
program for new students.
Kate has paid special attention

to guiding, counseling, and fac
ulty-student relations.
Other ideas especially adapted
to Berlin's "street - car campus"
are (lie OIT - Campus Men's and
Women's Clubs, the Graduate
Students' Association, and the
Co-Rec activities.

But the one thing they're going
to be certain to take back to Ber
lin with them is the nebulous
"Farm spirit." It was Kurt who
took one look at Cal's Campanile
and jeered, "Just an undernour
ished Hoover Tower!"

j Geissler, and Kurt Heilmann are
1 students at the Free University of

Berlin; and Kate Astnuss is associ
ate professor of Asiatic and Slavic
languages at their university. They
have been at Stanford for two
quarters on a State Department
grant to study student government
at one of the schools where it is
best developed.
"I can't believe we're leaving. It
seems we've been here all our
lives," brown - eyed Inge half
laughs, half moans.
Not that they mind living in the
strategic island of Berlin. "In fact,"
Inge laughs, "when we're home it
doesn't seem so dangerous. It's
when we're in California that
things seem bad in Berlin. Actu
ally living in Berlin is a wonderful
experience — people standing to
gether, and helping each other
out."
"As long as the Western powers
stay, we'll be all right," Kurt be
lieves. "We need them. Bcrlincrs
feel much more preoccupation
than the rest of Germany."
"Of course, we'd like to see the
Americans leave if there were no
Russians. It's been eight years,
and still we're not back to nor
mal. But that's just idealistic and
unrealistic," Inge adds.
One of the major jobs of the Free
University's student government is
to help out the 40 per cent of the
students who come from the East
Zone.
"Everyone from the Soviet zone
gets a scholarship £rom the city,
private individuals, or the Bonn

government," Ro points out.
The students come from the East
Zone knowing that they can never
go back.
"It's a crime to go to the uni
versity," Ko explains. "You lose
your identification cards and your
citizenship."
"Yes, we're a capitalistic, war
m on g e r in g institution," Inge
laughs again,
"The Communists don't even try
to make propaganda at the Free
University," Rudy breaks in. "They
spread their pamphlets at every
other university in Germany, but
here they don't even try. They
know it's hopeless."
Kate believes that you can't com
pare anything about Stanford and
Berlin except that they both have
students, professors, books, and
classrooms.
The others disagree. Both schools
have active student governments.
They are different, of course.
For one thing, Berlin students
participate in almost every ad
ministrative decision. "We even
have two students who help to
elect the president," Ro elabo
rates.
"Another obvious difference is
that our university has no campus,"
Kurt says.
"The whole residential system
breaks down," Inge continues.
"Yes, our legislative body has to
represent academic departments in
stead of living areas," Rudy addds.
"And we don't have all this stress

on committees and group work,"
Kate says. "Our students live and
study on their own. Personally, I
like this concentration around de
partments and common interest in
a subject, rather than the social
stress."
But the students like the social
stress. "You meet only on an aca
demic level iii Berlin," Kurt ex
plains. "The students there arc
more formal, more reserved,
harder to get to know."
"For instance, they call each oth
er 'Mr.'," Rudy chips in.
"But it makes friendship more
meaningful, when you wait before
using first names," Kate insists.
"The one thing I won't bring back
are the blind dates," Rudy declares
in his positive way. "Our girls
would kill me. Do you know my
first impression of Roble? — they
stand in line for dates. We walked
in and said we needed five; they
asked 'How tall?'"
There are lots of ideas they will
take back to Berlin from Stanford.
Kurt has worked with Encina .spon
sors and Pre-Reg, and is hoping
to initiate some kind of orientation
program for new students.
Kate has paid special attention

to guiding, counseling, and fac
ulty-student relations.
Other ideas especially adapted
to Berlin's "street - car campus"
are (lie OIT - Campus Men's and
Women's Clubs, the Graduate
Students' Association, and the
Co-Rec activities.

But the one thing they're going
to be certain to take back to Ber
lin with them is the nebulous
"Farm spirit." It was Kurt who
took one look at Cal's Campanile
and jeered, "Just an undernour
ished Hoover Tower!"

laughs, half moans.
Not that they mind living in the
strategic island of Berlin. "In fact,"
Inge laughs, "when we're home it
doesn't seem so dangerous. It's
when we're in California that
things seem bad in Berlin. Actu
ally living in Berlin is a wonderful
experience — people standing to
gether, and helping each other
out."
"As long as the Western powers
stay, we'll be all right," Kurt be
lieves. "We need them. Bcrlincrs
feel much more preoccupation
than the rest of Germany."
"Of course, we'd like to see the
Americans leave if there were no
Russians. It's been eight years,
and still we're not back to nor
mal. But that's just idealistic and
unrealistic," Inge adds.
One of the major jobs of the Free
University's student government is
to help out the 40 per cent of the
students who come from the East
Zone.
"Everyone from the Soviet zone
gets a scholarship £rom the city,
private individuals, or the Bonn

government," Ro points out.
The students come from the East
Zone knowing that they can never
go back.
"It's a crime to go to the uni
versity," Ko explains. "You lose
your identification cards and your
citizenship."
"Yes, we're a capitalistic, war
m on g e r in g institution," Inge
laughs again,
"The Communists don't even try
to make propaganda at the Free
University," Rudy breaks in. "They
spread their pamphlets at every
other university in Germany, but
here they don't even try. They
know it's hopeless."
Kate believes that you can't com
pare anything about Stanford and
Berlin except that they both have
students, professors, books, and
classrooms.
The others disagree. Both schools
have active student governments.
They are different, of course.
For one thing, Berlin students
participate in almost every ad
ministrative decision. "We even
have two students who help to
elect the president," Ro elabo
rates.
"Another obvious difference is
that our university has no campus,"
Kurt says.
"The whole residential system
breaks down," Inge continues.
"Yes, our legislative body has to
represent academic departments in
stead of living areas," Rudy addds.
"And we don't have all this stress

on committees and group work,"
Kate says. "Our students live and
study on their own. Personally, I
like this concentration around de
partments and common interest in
a subject, rather than the social
stress."
But the students like the social
stress. "You meet only on an aca
demic level iii Berlin," Kurt ex
plains. "The students there arc
more formal, more reserved,
harder to get to know."
"For instance, they call each oth
er 'Mr.'," Rudy chips in.
"But it makes friendship more
meaningful, when you wait before
using first names," Kate insists.
"The one thing I won't bring back
are the blind dates," Rudy declares
in his positive way. "Our girls
would kill me. Do you know my
first impression of Roble? — they
stand in line for dates. We walked
in and said we needed five; they
asked 'How tall?'"
There are lots of ideas they will
take back to Berlin from Stanford.
Kurt has worked with Encina .spon
sors and Pre-Reg, and is hoping
to initiate some kind of orientation
program for new students.
Kate has paid special attention

to guiding, counseling, and fac
ulty-student relations.
Other ideas especially adapted
to Berlin's "street - car campus"
are (lie OIT - Campus Men's and
Women's Clubs, the Graduate
Students' Association, and the
Co-Rec activities.

But the one thing they're going
to be certain to take back to Ber
lin with them is the nebulous
"Farm spirit." It was Kurt who
took one look at Cal's Campanile
and jeered, "Just an undernour
ished Hoover Tower!"


BACK TO BERLlN—Professor Kate Asmuss, Stanford student Phil Saeta, and Free University
of Berlin students Rudy Geissler, Inge Krauss, Ro Rosenfeld and Kurt Heilmann discuss the
two quarters the visitors spent studying Stanford and its student government.
(Ho Rosenfeld, Inge Krauss, |
Rudy Geissler, Kurt lleilmaiiii,
and Kate Asmuss left Stanford
during spring vacation. Daily
Night ICditor Tuerk interviewed
them just before they left.)

There are five of them, and

i together they can dissect a

than it takes to say "Auf Wieder-
I sehen."
Ro Rosenfeld, Inge Krauss, Rudy

1 students at the Free University of

Berlin; and Kate Astnuss is associ
ate professor of Asiatic and Slavic
languages at their university. They
have been at Stanford for two
quarters on a State Department
grant to study student government
at one of the schools where it is
best developed.
