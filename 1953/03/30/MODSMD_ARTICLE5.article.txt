WASHINGTON â€” American offi
cials today viewed Red China's of
fer to exchange sick and wounded
prisoners in Korea as an acid test
of whether the Communist world
really wants peace or has just been
talking.
Diplomatic circles here felt that if
the Communists go through with
the exchange on United Nations
terms it will be significant of a gen
eral lessening of East - West ten
sions. I * *
American sources in Korea said
they thought the Chinese Commu
nist proposal was made because of
fear of a United Nations spring of
fensive.
Aside from the issue of whether
the oiler was sincere, the big ques
tion was whether it was dictated
by the new rulers in the Kremlin
or whether it reflected Chinese
weariness with the long and costly
Korean conflict.
