Stanford's world affairs television
show—"'People, Places, and Politics"
I — was presented an award for
achievement in local television by
the San Francisco Television Acad
emy Saturday night.
The unusual merit award, one of
seven awards presented by the
Academy at its annual awards ban
quet at the Mark Hopkins Hotel,
went to Professor Stanley T. Donner,
director of radio and television at
Stanford, and producer of the 13-
week series.
The award was determined by a
12-man committee of the Academy.
The committee acted on nominations
rather than by ballotting in specific
categories as was the case in 1951.
