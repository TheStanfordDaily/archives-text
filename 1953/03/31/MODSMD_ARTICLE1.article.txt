## 
### BOB REZAK 
A University application to purchase the Stanford Village prop
city iioni the government may be reactivated il the government's
1!J50 military freeze order is lifted, University officials declared
yesterday.
The possibility that the 1950 freeze order may be lifted was i

reported last week by the Palo Alto
Times. The Times quoted Justin
Herman of the federal Housing and
Home Financing Agency in San
Francisco as saying he is attempting
to get a military hold on the prop
erty released, and is hoping for an
answer from Washington in about
two weeks.
Under an agreement reached in
1946, Stanford acquired temporary
title to the property for housing
veteran students.
Earlier this month Stanford and
the Public Housing Authority in
San Francisco sent a joint request
to the government that the 1950
freeze order be lifted.
Herman's statement, as reported.by
The Times, is the only indication
University officials have had of a
possible removal of the freeze order
in the immediate future.
Meantime, reports indicated that
Mcnlo Park officials and civic
groups were planning strong pro
tests against the possibility that
the University may renew its ap
plication to acquire the property.
But later indications were that they
would hold hack any protests until
Stanford made its position clear.
Herman, according to The Times,
declared that all groups or persons
interested in the Villfige property
would be called together if the freeze
older is removed. In such a case,
Herman said, the government will
decide what is best in the public
interest.
A Stanford spokesman yesterday
explained the University's position
regarding the property.
In 194(5, he pointed out, Stanford
took over the Village, which was
then the Dibble General Hospital
for war casualties. This was part of
a government policy put into effect
throughout the nation and was based
on the supposition that temporary
housing for veteran students be on
a thrce-ycar-duration basis.
Later it became evident that the
need for housing would exceed the
three-year duration.
In 1950 the government's housing
act was amended to allow transfer of
ownership of temporary housing to
universities on application by the
universities. Stanford complied with
this amendment and submitted its
application.
The amendment further provided
that the applicant must purchase
the land which underlies the proj
ect. Stanford then began negotia
tions under its application until
they were interrupted by the out
break of the Korean war.
in July. 1950, a Presidential order
declared the status of the property
as frozen to protect the possibility
of using it for defense purposes.
This is the freeze order still in
effect.
Under the terms of its application,
Stanford cannot transfer property
to private hands for housing pur
poses. Further, within six months
after the date of transfer, the Uni
versity must obtain approval of the
local government body (Menlo Park)
for whatever use is to be made of
the property.
The Village proper comprises 85.(54
acres of land and has been designated
for University use since 1946. That
same year Stanford agreed that 29.8
acres of the property was in excess
of University needs for the Village.
Menlo Park later purchased the
excess land for its civic center.
Similarly, Stanford agreed that
Irt.S acres of land along Middlefield
Road was in excess of its needs.
The Sequoia Union High School
District then acquired the land for
its use.
Under terms made in 1946 and
1950, Stanford is committed to tear
ing down Village buildings when
they are no longer needed. Estimated
cost of such an operation in 1947
amounted to $200,000.
But should the housing facilities
be requested by the military, Stan
ford is removed of its obligations.
(The Army recently decided it
did not want the Village for use as
a new hospital).
More than 1,000 students arc
currently living in Village housing
facilities.
Stanford officials, in summing up
their position, said they have always
wanted the property and still want
it.

Herman, according to The Times,

Under the terms of its application,
Stanford cannot transfer property
to private hands for housing pur
