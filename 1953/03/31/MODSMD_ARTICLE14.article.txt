# Red China Abandons Repatriation Demands
## UN 						Diplomats Are Cautious

UNITED NATIONS. N.Y.,
March 30 (UP)râ€”United Nations
diplomats greeted Communist
China's new Korean proposal
with optimism today although
they noted there may be traps
in it.
General Asjfemtyy President Les
ter B. Pearson of' Canada called it
"a very important development and
it should be obviously followed up."
Several observers pointed out
that the language of Chinese Red
Foreign Minister Chou En-lai was
not precise on a number of points
in proposing that prisoners who do
not want to go home be sent to a
neutral country until their future
is settled.
For instance, they pointed out,
he did not make clear whether
he was insisting that all prisoners
must eventually return to their
homelands, even though they
might temporarily go to a "neu
tral state."
Finally, there was concern lest
the whole plan might be torpedoed
by Chou's insistence that he was
sticking to the "principle" of full
repatriation of all prisoners.
The Chinese offer on the thorny
prisoner of war issue, which'
blocked an armistice when set
tlement seemed almost in sight
last October, touched off an un
dercurrent of cautious hope in the
capital.
The State Department noted in a
statement read to reporters, how
ever, that as of now this govern
ment has received no formal offer
from the Communists. As far as the
United States is concerned, it was
said, the Red proposal was merely
sent over the airwaves and not di
rected at anyone in particular.
But it added that "we of course
welcome any indications that the
Communists arc now interested in
resolving the POW question on a
humanitarian basis." It advised the
Communists to make a formal pro
posal through the U.N. liaison offi
cers at Panmunjom.
The Panmunjom truce talks col
lapsed last Oct. 8 when the U.N.
refused to force Red prisoners to
return behind the Iron Curtain
without their consent. That was the
sole issue blocking an armistice.
