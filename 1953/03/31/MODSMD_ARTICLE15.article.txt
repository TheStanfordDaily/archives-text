# Korea Quiet Hint Peace Bid Tieup

TOKYO, Tuesday, March 31 (UP)
â€”The Korean front quieted in day
light yesterday after U.S. Marines
and South Koreans beat back four
night attacks.
There was some speculation that
the sudden letup, after a week of
blazing action, might be tied in with
the Communists' latest peace bid.
Daylight fighting was lighter than
at any time since Chinese slammed
into the central front's Old Baldy a
week ago and followed with attacks
against Marines guarding the west
ern invasion route to Seoul.
Those assaults were the heaviest
in five months.
American Sabre jets probably de
stroyed one MIG-15 jet and flam
aged two in moderate air action.
Two more damage claims awaited
confirmation.
Marines on Vegas Hill, led by two
veterans of Guadalcanal fighting in
World War 11, stood by their guns
in newly dug trenches and were
alert for new attacks.
Col. Lewis W. Walt, commander
of the Fifth Marine Regiment,
thought the Chinese merely were
whipped temporarily but would
come back. He .said Vegas "seems
to have become an issue with
them."
