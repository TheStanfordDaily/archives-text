# Stassen Raps Joe McCarthy

### 
WASHINGTON, March 30 (UP)
The Eisenhower administration to
day accused Sen. Joseph R. McCar
thy (R., Wis.) of invading the field
of diplomacy and of "undermining"
its efforts to cut off shipping to
Communist countries.
Central figures in the new fight
were McCarthy, the State De
partment, and Mutual Security
Administrator Harold E. Stassen,
who testified before McCarthy's
permanent Senate Investigating
Committee as it opened hearings
on Allied trade with Iron Curtain
countries.
In a bitter public exchange, Stas
sen accused McCarthy of "not co
operating" with the administration
and of being "facetious." The GOP
Senator angrily charged that Stas
sen was treating lightly a matter of
"life and death" to men in the Ko
rean war.
In its second clash with the fiery
Wisconsin Senator in a week, the
new Republican administration also
charged that McCarthy tried to gain
credit for an agreement under which
Greek-flag vessels arc forbidden to
trade with Red China or North Ko
rea.
At one point, Stassen turned to
McCarthy and said:
"I plead with you for co-opera
tion between the (wo branches of
govcrnmtnt."
"You needn't plead with me,
Governor," McCarthy snapped.
McCarthy also told Stassen he
will "continue to remove every ship
I can from trade with Communist
China" whether the administration
likes it or not. He said lie hopes to
make an agreement with the own
ers of 150 more foreign-flag ships in
London soon.
As Stassen was testifying, the
State Department announced that
the Greek government agreed on
March 23 to forbid all Greek-flag
vessels to call at any Chinese or
North Korean port.
At the height of their wrangle,
Stassen demanded to know whether
McCarthy got the agreement from
the Greek ship owners by promis
ing to call off the committee's in
vestigation.
