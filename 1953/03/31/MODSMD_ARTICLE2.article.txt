# $10 MILLION
## Durkin Slices Labor Budget 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 30 (UP)—
The Labor Department slashed
$10,403,000 from ex-President Tru
man's budget request today and
Republican Congressional leaders
reported that the huge foreign aid
program definitely can be cut.
Secretary of Labor Martin P.
Durkin appeared before the Senate
Appropriations Committee to re
quest appropriations of $321,4 1 5,(500
for his department for the fiscal
year beginning July 1. This com
pared with $331,818,600 proposed by
Mr. Truman just before he left of
fice.
On the basis of Mr. Truman's
revenue estimates, federal spending
would have to be cut $10,000,000,000
to balance the budget. GOP fiscal
experts believe his estimate may
have been low, however, and that
such sharp cutbacks will not be
necessary to wipe out red - ink
spending.
The GOP Congressional chiefs,
headed by Senate Republican Lead
er Robert A. Taft, said after a con
ference with President Eisenhower
that there is "no question" but that
cuts can be made in the $7,500,000,-
000 foreign aid program proposed
by Mr. Truman.
