### 
TOKYO. Tuesday, March 31
(UP) —Red China offered today
to end the Korean war by giv
ing up its armistice - blocking
demand that unwilling war
prisoners be forced to return
home.
"The time m;iy bo considered 1 ipo
for settling the entire question >C
prisoners of war in order to in. uro
the end of hostilities in Korea and
to conclude the armistice," said a
dramatic broadcast from Peiping.
Just home from Moscow, Premier
Chou En-lai laid before the Allies
a peace plan which purported to
wipe out the last issue between tho
United Nations and the Communi: I
truce negotiators.
He said prisoners who do not
want to go home could lie hand* d
over to a "neutral state," not
named, until their future could
he "justly settled." The Iteds pre
viously had demanded that all
war prisoners, willing or not, he
sent home.
This apparent Red surrender on
voluntary repatriation, which broke
up the truce talks last, October, fol
lowed by 48 hours a Communist
agreement to an Allied proposal for
the exchange of sick and wounded
captives.
Chou said the offer, for both Red
China and North Korea, was being
made "only to put an end to the
bloody war in Korea."
The first unofficial reaction in
the Western world was a surge ot
hope, tempered with caution.
Spokesmen made it plain that «h<-
peace plan would be put under
tho Allied microscope to test its
sincerity and acceptability.
Diplomatic officials said privately
the proposal, if genuine, might
mean a turning point in the East-
West cold war.
ft. capped a steadily developing
"peace offensive" by Russia and the
Communist satellites which began
with the turnover in the Kremlin
caused by the death of Stalin.
Even before Chou spoke, Ameri
can officials in Washington said the
Allies would agree promptly to re
open the truce talks if the Commu
nists go through with their offer Pi
exchange sick and wounded pi I:,on
ers.
The U.S. statement said "lI.N.
Command liaison officers remain
available at Panmunjom to re
ceive any constructive proposal
or further communications with
regard to the armistice negotia
tions which the Communists wish
to bring to our attention."
The State Department was being
ultra cautious about the Chinese
proposal. Officials intimated pri
vately that they have been stun;;
before by Communist "peace" of
fers that turned out to be jokers.

TOKYO. Tuesday, March 31
(UP) —Red China offered today
to end the Korean war by giv
ing up its armistice - blocking
demand that unwilling war
prisoners be forced to return
home.

want to go home could lie hand* d

viously had demanded that all
war prisoners, willing or not, he
sent home.
This apparent Red surrender on
voluntary repatriation, which broke
up the truce talks last, October, fol
lowed by 48 hours a Communist
agreement to an Allied proposal for
the exchange of sick and wounded
captives.
Chou said the offer, for both Red
China and North Korea, was being
made "only to put an end to the
bloody war in Korea."
The first unofficial reaction in
the Western world was a surge ot
hope, tempered with caution.
Spokesmen made it plain that «h<-
peace plan would be put under
tho Allied microscope to test its
sincerity and acceptability.
Diplomatic officials said privately
the proposal, if genuine, might
mean a turning point in the East-
West cold war.

"peace offensive" by Russia and the
Communist satellites which began
with the turnover in the Kremlin
caused by the death of Stalin.

Allies would agree promptly to re
open the truce talks if the Commu
nists go through with their offer Pi
exchange sick and wounded pi I:,on
ers.
