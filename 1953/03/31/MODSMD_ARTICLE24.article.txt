# Puncturing the McCarthy Balloon
## 
### 
Senator Joseph McCarthy has again been
shown up as a demagogue and headline hunter.
His brazen claim that he, almost single
handedly, negotiated a special agreement with
Gieek shipping firms prohibiting future trade
with Red China, has been shown, by spokes
men of the administration, to be another try for
front page notoriety.
One government official commenting to
James Reston, diplomatic correspondent lor
the New York Times, even went so far as to
brand McCarthy's claims "phony."
McCarthy, in a self-praising mood, proudly
announced last Saturday that he had completed
negotiations with Greek shippers that would
stop trade between Greece and Red China.
That, he beamed, is a "major blow to Commu
nism."
But, it seems the "major blow" had been
dealt a week ago yesterday, not by the boast
lul McCarthy, but by th£ quiet, industrious
diplomats of the State Department. Working
without page-one fanfare, the diplomats con
cluded, on March 23, an agreement with the
Greek government that officially terminated
trade between that coountry and the Peiping
regime.
All McCarthy did, despite his cocky boasts,
was to get assurances from Greek shippers

that they would abide by their government's
edict, a foregone conclusion.
From this minor negotiation, McCarthy was
once again able to boom his name into front
page type. McCarthy caught the news agencies
ofi guard, making his announcement at a hastily
called press conference close to deadline time
for most eastern newspapers. This prevented 1
immediate invesligation of his claims. So the
Sunday papers recorded McCarthy's achieve
ment. It wasn't until yesterday, when the
government offices were open, that the report
ers could check McCarthy's statement.
This incident, an unsightly blot, points up
the extremes of the Wisconsin Senator's am
bition.
It also points up a dangerous precedent, that
of indifferently brushing aside the Constitu
tion. The Constitution charges the President
with the execution of foreign policy.
Yet McCarthy, alone, aloof, telling -the press
that "he didn't want any interference," under
took to dictate a portion of oyr foreign affairs.
He bypassed the State Department, the arm of
government specifically entrusted with foreign
affairs; he circumvented the Constitution; he !
tried to set himself up as the single oracle of
"Good Americanism," a bold, reckless affront
to this nation's democratic heritage.

Senator Joseph McCarthy has again been
shown up as a demagogue and headline hunter.
His brazen claim that he, almost single
handedly, negotiated a special agreement with
Gieek shipping firms prohibiting future trade
with Red China, has been shown, by spokes
men of the administration, to be another try for
front page notoriety.
One government official commenting to
James Reston, diplomatic correspondent lor
the New York Times, even went so far as to
brand McCarthy's claims "phony."
McCarthy, in a self-praising mood, proudly
announced last Saturday that he had completed
negotiations with Greek shippers that would
stop trade between Greece and Red China.
That, he beamed, is a "major blow to Commu
nism."
But, it seems the "major blow" had been
dealt a week ago yesterday, not by the boast
lul McCarthy, but by th£ quiet, industrious
diplomats of the State Department. Working
without page-one fanfare, the diplomats con
cluded, on March 23, an agreement with the
Greek government that officially terminated
trade between that coountry and the Peiping
regime.
All McCarthy did, despite his cocky boasts,
was to get assurances from Greek shippers

that they would abide by their government's
edict, a foregone conclusion.
From this minor negotiation, McCarthy was
once again able to boom his name into front
page type. McCarthy caught the news agencies
ofi guard, making his announcement at a hastily
