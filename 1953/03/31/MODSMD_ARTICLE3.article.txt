# Off-Shore Oil Debate Opens

### 
WASHINGTON. March 30 (UP) —
The House opened debate today on
legislation to grant coastal states
ownership of the oil-bearing tide
lands off their shores.
Rep. Chauncey W. Reed (R., 111.),
chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, called for passage of the
controversial measure to break a
legal "stalemate" that he said has
blocked development of "needed"
off-shore oil resources.
But Rep. Emanuel Celler (D.,
N.Y.), leading the opposition,
claimed the House was wasting its
time because the Supreme Court
would declare the bill, if passed,
unconstitutional.
None doubted that the House
would approve the bill.
It would give coastal states
clear title to submerged off-shore
lands out to their historic sea
boundaries. Under the measure,
Louisiana, Texas, and California
would get about a l!t per cent
share of the estimated $38,000.-
000,000 worth of "potential" oil
buried in the continental shelf.
The Library of Congress esti
mated that the continental shelf off
California, Texas, and Louisiana
contains $37,890,862,500 worth of oil
of which the three states would get
$7.375,000.000 —or 19 per cent—un
der the pending bill.
