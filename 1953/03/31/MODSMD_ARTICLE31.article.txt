# 180 Pints Per Hour Needed in Blood Drive
## 
### 
Five thousand four hundred
rolls.
Forty blankets.
Three hundred fifty chairs.
Eight typewriters.
And so on down the list. It's
all part of the preparations the
Red Cross is making for Stan
ford's big Blood Drive April 13-
17.
Five thousand pints in five days
—that's the goal, and if it's going
to be reached, there'll have to be
facilities for 45 donors every 15
minutes. And that means lots of
planning.
The Red Cross began making
arrangements more than four
months ago, when Ken Schechter,
ex-Navy flyer now a Stanford
junior, obtained the ASSU Ex
com's support for the mammoth
venture.
Planning is centered in the Red
Cross's Palo Alto chapter, which
is throwing its full resources be
hind the drive. Costs are ex
pected to total about $2,000 for
the week, so the chapter is bear
ing down«extra hard on its cur
rent fund campaign.
Blood collecting operations in
four counties will close down for
the week of the drive so that
enough equipment can be
brought to Stanford. The Santa
Clara Valley Regional Blood
Center in San Jose—which serves

the area— will send its two mo
bile units and reschedule dona
tion dates at places like Fort Ord
for later this year.
Taking care of a thousand
donors a day means that close
to 15(1 workers—students, lte<l
Cross volunteers, and profes
sional blood unit personnel—
must lie on duty at all times.
Some of their duties:
Checking appointments, minor
consent cards, and labelling bot
tles.
Taking medical histories to de
termine if the donors are physi
cally qualified (ten registered
nurses — five of them volunteers
—under a doctor's supervision
will do this work).
Serving coffee or milk and
doughnuts to the donors.
Everything from telephones to
paper clips has been accounted
for in the detailed plans that have
b&en drawn up for the week. The
Pavilion itself is the subject of a
huge chart that shows just where
every desk and table will In
placed and just how traffic will
move.
The enthusiasm of the Red
Cross workers themselves matches
that of Schechter and his 75-
student committee. They all hope
that the big drive will stimulate a
regular flow of donors in the fu
ture, and that a challenge to other
universities will mean larger
quotas all over the nation.

venture.
Planning is centered in the Red
Cross's Palo Alto chapter, which
is throwing its full resources be
hind the drive. Costs are ex
pected to total about $2,000 for
the week, so the chapter is bear
ing down«extra hard on its cur
rent fund campaign.
Blood collecting operations in
four counties will close down for
the week of the drive so that
enough equipment can be
brought to Stanford. The Santa
Clara Valley Regional Blood
Center in San Jose—which serves

the area— will send its two mo
bile units and reschedule dona
tion dates at places like Fort Ord
for later this year.
Taking care of a thousand
donors a day means that close
to 15(1 workers—students, lte<l
Cross volunteers, and profes
sional blood unit personnel—
must lie on duty at all times.
Some of their duties:
Checking appointments, minor
consent cards, and labelling bot
tles.
Taking medical histories to de
termine if the donors are physi
cally qualified (ten registered
nurses — five of them volunteers
—under a doctor's supervision
will do this work).
Serving coffee or milk and
doughnuts to the donors.
Everything from telephones to
paper clips has been accounted
for in the detailed plans that have
b&en drawn up for the week. The
Pavilion itself is the subject of a
huge chart that shows just where
every desk and table will In
placed and just how traffic will
move.
The enthusiasm of the Red
Cross workers themselves matches
that of Schechter and his 75-
student committee. They all hope
that the big drive will stimulate a
regular flow of donors in the fu
ture, and that a challenge to other
universities will mean larger
quotas all over the nation.


BLOOD DRIVE PLANNERS— Mrs. Irma F. Barrett, assistant aministrative director of the Red
Cross Regional Blood Center in San Jose, and Mrs. James A. Quimby, chairman of the blood
donor service of the Palo Alto Red Cross Chapter, discuss this quarter's Stanford Blood Drive
with student committee members Dan Wilbur, Ken Schechter, Rachael Oatman, and Jean Fox.
Five thousand four hundred
rolls.
Forty blankets.
Three hundred fifty chairs.
Eight typewriters.
And so on down the list. It's
all part of the preparations the
Red Cross is making for Stan
ford's big Blood Drive April 13-
17.
Five thousand pints in five days
—that's the goal, and if it's going
to be reached, there'll have to be
facilities for 45 donors every 15
minutes. And that means lots of
planning.
The Red Cross began making
arrangements more than four
months ago, when Ken Schechter,
ex-Navy flyer now a Stanford
junior, obtained the ASSU Ex
com's support for the mammoth
venture.
