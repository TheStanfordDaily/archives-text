## Dorsey Atkinson Is Hero As Ruggers Down Cal, UCLA 
### MIKE HUDSON Daily Sports Editor 
Stanford's ruggers won two
matches over tough foes during
the month. This Saturday they
will meet Cal at Berkeley.
Way back on March 7 the Indians
edged the Bears 17-16. The Bears
boasted an 11-point lead early in
the second half and apparently had
the game sewed up until Stanford
burst forth with a 17-point splurge.
Card hero was Dorsey Atkinson.
He kicked conversions and kick- j
offs for the frosh footballers last
fall and his educated toe accounted !

for eight Stanford points. Atkinson
| scored three more when he dashed
20 yards for a try.
Card Sam Morley contributed the
play of the game when he made
good a running dropkick from 30
yards out.
Two weeks later the Cards
avenged their lone setback of the
[ year by drubbing a previously un
beaten UCLA team 18 to 0.
Atkinson again led the scorers
with nine points. He scored three
| conversions, which in rugby are
worth two points, and scored a try.
The Cards grabbed a quick 5-0
lead when Cook scored on a 35-
yard pass-and-rush. Sam Morley
lateraled to Fletch Metten, who
j threw to Cook. Atkinson converted.
Bonetti fell on a Sam Morley
i punt in the end zone for three more
points. Atkinson missed his con
j version and the half ended with the
jscore 13-0.
Star for the Bruins was Bob Hey
| denfelt whose booming punts kept
' the score from reaching more as
i tronomical heights.
