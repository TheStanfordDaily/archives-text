# PCL to Open Season Today

### 
SAN FRANCISCO, March 30
(UP) — The Pacific Coast League
raises the curtain on the 1953 base
ball season tomorrow, firmly en
trenched against any deals with the
majors that call for optioned play
ers.
Approximately 40,000 fans are ex
pected to be on hand in the four
California parks as the league
moves into its second year under an
"open" classification which has left
the top players of the circuit free
from the major league draft.
Not only are the PCL stars now
draft-proof, but the league also
will function this season with a
no - option arrangement that is
supposed to lie free from all gim
micks.
The no-option clause prevents
players from coming down from
the majors on a recall basis. They
have to be sold outright to the
Coast League clubs. PCL teams
can't re-sell the player back to
that same team until he has been
waived out of the open circuit.
Here is a rundown on tomorrow's
opening games, with probable start
ing pitchers and last year's record
in parentheses.
Seattle, Al Widmar (20-12) at
Oakland, Allen Gettel (17-14).
