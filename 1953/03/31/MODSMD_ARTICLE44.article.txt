# SRI Develops a New Method For Detecting Air Pollution
## 
### 
A new method of identifying and
continuously measuring hydrogen
fluoride gas, a potentially injurious
air pollutant, has recently been de
veloped by Stanford Research In
stitute.
The new device, able to detect
and measure parts per million of
HF gas in the atmosphere, is essen
tially a roll of filter paper impreg
nated with a fluorescent metal salt.
Contact with the slightest trace of
HF gas diminishes the fluorescence.
As the paper tape unwinds from
one spool to another, a limited sec
tion of the moving surface is ex
posed to the atmosphere. Variations
in fluorescence arc measured pho-
and the results are
graphed on a continuous recorder.
SRl's instrument is designed to
record fluctuations over a period of

| several days and may be left un
attended in the field.
According to William E. Rand, di
rector of research in the physical
sciences at SRI, research has indi
cated that certain industrial facto
ries may raise the atmospheric flu
oride coneentation to a high level.
As an indication of the gas's po
tency, several parts of fluoride per
billion parts of air can cause vege
tation damage.
