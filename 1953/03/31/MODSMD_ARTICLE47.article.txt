### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
"Stanford Short Stories, 1953,"
the best of the annual crop of
short stories written in classes
at the Stanford Creative Writing
Center, is on sale now at the
Stanford Bookstore. The book is
the seventh annual collection of
stories published by Stanford.
The edition is edited by Wallace
Stegner, who heads the Center's
sfiiff, and Richard Scowcroft, associ
ate professor of English.
The common theme shared by the
eleven writers whose work appears
in "Stanford Short Stories, 1953,"
according to Wallace Stegner, is the j
following: "Every story in this col
lection deals in some way with a
theme of exile or dislocation, of
division between an individual and
his home, his country, his culture,
his tradition, the health of his own
soul."
The authors represented in the
collection have diverse hack
grounds, three coming from for
eign countries. Bernard Taper was
born in London, Edgar Rosenberg
in Bavaria, and Amador Daguio in
the Philippines.

Stegner commented further that
though some of these stories are sad,
the book is neither lugubrious nor
despairing.
"I take it as a sign of great health
among these young writers," said
Stegner," that even when looking
soberly at their life they arc—so
little inclined, as they might be, to
prove that this is the worst of all
i possible worlds — a group that
to grant their people a little laugh
j ter, a chance of success, a consist
i cut dignity."
At the end of the book is a section
J entitled "On the Writing of a Story."
; Each young author tells where he
or she received the idea for his or
her story, and how the problems of
! plot and characterization were
| worked out.
For instance, Leonard Casper
! transformed an ex-Marine friend
i into the girl heroine of "Deep Coun
try Part." Joseph Stockwell met a
bombed-out shoemaker in Alsace
who wouldn't speak French out of
principle and put him in "In the
Borderland," and Stanford Whit
more "saw Bontemps' death bubble
in the mouth of a woman who col
lapsed on a Palo Alto street two
winters ago."

short stories written in classes
at the Stanford Creative Writing
Center, is on sale now at the
Stanford Bookstore. The book is
the seventh annual collection of
stories published by Stanford.
The edition is edited by Wallace
Stegner, who heads the Center's
sfiiff, and Richard Scowcroft, associ
ate professor of English.
The common theme shared by the
eleven writers whose work appears
in "Stanford Short Stories, 1953,"
according to Wallace Stegner, is the j
following: "Every story in this col
lection deals in some way with a
theme of exile or dislocation, of
division between an individual and
his home, his country, his culture,
his tradition, the health of his own
soul."
The authors represented in the
collection have diverse hack
grounds, three coming from for
eign countries. Bernard Taper was
born in London, Edgar Rosenberg
in Bavaria, and Amador Daguio in
the Philippines.

Stegner commented further that
though some of these stories are sad,
the book is neither lugubrious nor
despairing.
"I take it as a sign of great health
among these young writers," said
Stegner," that even when looking
soberly at their life they arc—so
little inclined, as they might be, to
prove that this is the worst of all
i possible worlds — a group that
to grant their people a little laugh
j ter, a chance of success, a consist
