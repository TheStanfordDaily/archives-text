# Royal Family, Nobility Pay Homage to Queen

### 
LONDON, March 30 (UP)â€”Members of the Royal Family and
European nobility paid homage tonight to Queen Mary, lying in
state in ancient Westminster Hall before her funeral at Windsor
tomorrow.
The Duke of Windsor, the Princess Royal, the Duke and Duchess

of Gloucester and the Earl and
Countess of Harewood arrived at
about 6 p.m. and stood facing the
catafalque for half an hour.
Few of the long lines of mourners
filing past the coffin recognized the
royal party. A steady stream of
Britons and many foreigners passed
by at the rate of 5.000 an hour de
spite blustery rain.
The Duke of Windsor, the
Queen's favorite son, stood in the
centcr of the royal group. On ar
riving and departing the men bow
ed and the women curtsied in the
direction of the coffin.
Tomorrow the Royal Family will
claim Queen Mary from the nation
and bury her in simple "family"
ceremonies before an invited con
gregation that includes four queens,
two kings and other members of
Europe's dwindling royalty.
Today she still belonged to the
people and long lines of men and
women streamed past the purple
draped catafalque.
Among them were members of the
Russian embassy whose appearance
caused a ripple of comment. They
stood in respectful silcncc for a
moment before the bier and then
moved on.
