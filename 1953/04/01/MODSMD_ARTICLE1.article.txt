### 
Part of the type "O" blood col
lected in the 5,000-pint Blood
Drive April 13-17 will be
shipped directly by air from the
campus to Korea, Drive Chair
man Ken Schechter announced
yesterday.
Arrangements have just been com
pleted for a helicopter to pick up
blood at Stanford and take it to
MofTet Field. The Military Air
Transport Service will fly the ship
ment to Travis Air Force Base, dis
patch center for whole blood flown
to Korea for transfusions on the
battlefield.
The helicopter will take off from

the soccer field—probably on April
14. the second day of blood collecting.
The field is near the basketball pa
villion, where the Red Cross will set

A meeting for all Blood Drive
workers will be held tonight at
7:30.
All solicitors, living group rep
resentatives, faculty, and Blood
drive Committee workers arc asked

up a 72-bed donation center.
Arrangements have been made for
the use of a helicopter manufactured
by Hiller Helicopters of Palo Alto.

Only type "O" blood goes to Ko
rea as whole blood. That not ship
ped by helicopter will be trucked to
San Jose and taken from there to
Moffet Field.
Other types of blood will be shut
tled by truck to San Jose for typing
and from there will go to labora
tories for processing into plasma and
serum albumin. Both are used in
battle areas, and the recently-de
veloped serum albumin has been
found especially valuable for treat
ing shock in Korea, since, unlike
plasma, it doesn't freeze.
Signups for the drive start next
Monday and last through April 10.
Appointments for donating can be
made with living group representa-

lives and. at tables on Quad.
