TOKYO, Wednesday, April 1
(UP) —Allied troops on the strange
ly quiet Korean front found evi
dence yesterday that Communists
expected an Allied offensive this
week.
U.N. patrols found propaganda
leaflets telling Red troops to be
ready to "defend to the death"
during April.
The discovery strengthened be
lief among some observers that
the Reds' latest peace moves were
tithed to avert a possible U.N. at
tack.
High sources believed the Reds'
unusual reluctance to fight during
the last two days was connected di
rectly with the latest peace offer
broadcast by Red China's Premier
Chou En-lai.

war:
1. American fighter - bombers
struck at three important Red sup
ply centers without opposition from
Red fighters.
2. Allied F-Bf> Sabre jets swept
northwest Korea l»n>king for a

fight hut for the first time in six
flays found no Keel MIG-15's.
3. Across the 155-mile front the
Reds took the initiative only in the
east where three early - morning
Communist probing attacks were
repulsed easily.
Some high sources believed the
Reds' reluctance to fight was con
nected directly with their latest
peace moves.
Discovery of the leaflets, written
with red ink in Chinese for distri
bution among Communist troops,
was reported by Allied patrols.
They said:
"Defend to the death from
April 3 to 30 with machine-gun
fire."

er, U.N. fighter - bombers hit Red
supply and troop centers with
bombs, rockets, and machine-gun
bullets.
