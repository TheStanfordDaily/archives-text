the truce village of Panmunjom.
The Reds also must be the ones
to set a definite meeting for liaison
officers to arrange exchange of sick
and wounded.
Under the permanent liaison
setup a new meeting can be ar
ranged in a matter of minutes.
Observers here expected a Red
call momentarily.
Clark, who flew to Korea with
Army Secretary Robert Stevens,
said he was ready to resume fuil
negotiations with the Reds "any
time their offer appears sincere."
He made clear, however, that re
newal of negotiations must be i
"second order of business" after ex
change of sick and wounded.

cers met for only two minutes yes
terday as Clark's letter was deliv
ered. It was addressed to North
Korean Premier and military com
mander-in-chief Kim II Sung and.
Gen. Peng Ten-hua, commander of
Chinese troops in Korea.
The letter replied to the origi
nal suggestion by Kim and IN ng
that sick and wounded prisoners
he exchanged and truce negotia
tions be resumed.
Kim said in a broadcast last night
that North Korea is in "full agree
ment" with Chou's offer.

passed through censorship said Ru
sia is expected to give full support
at the United Nations to Chou':, of

Informed sources said the Redo
might issue an immediate call for
meetings to arrange exchange of
sick and wounded prisoners.
If arrangements are satisfactory
to the United Nations, the stage will
be set for renewal of full armistice
negotiations.
Red China's Premier Chou En
lai yesterday sent his latest proposal
for repatriation of all prisoners to
the U.N. General Assembly in New
York.
The proposal, apparently ac
cepting the U.N. principle of vol
untary repatriation, still has not
been presented to the U.N. Com
mand here. It was broadcast by
Peiping Radio Monday.
Gen. Mark W. Clark, U.N. su
preme commander, agreed yester
day in a letter to the Reds to re
sume truce talks as soon as ar
rangements for exchange of sick
and wounded have been complet
ed.
He told correspondents that when
he receives Chou's offer it will get
"careful and sympathetic study."
Before the U.N. can act on it tho
Communists must deliver Chou':,
proposal to U.N. liaison officers at
the truce village of Panmunjom.
The Reds also must be the ones
to set a definite meeting for liaison
officers to arrange exchange of sick
and wounded.
Under the permanent liaison
setup a new meeting can be ar
ranged in a matter of minutes.
Observers here expected a Red
call momentarily.
Clark, who flew to Korea with
Army Secretary Robert Stevens,
said he was ready to resume fuil
negotiations with the Reds "any
time their offer appears sincere."
He made clear, however, that re
newal of negotiations must be i
"second order of business" after ex
change of sick and wounded.
U.N. and Communist liaison offi
cers met for only two minutes yes
terday as Clark's letter was deliv
ered. It was addressed to North
Korean Premier and military com
mander-in-chief Kim II Sung and.
Gen. Peng Ten-hua, commander of
Chinese troops in Korea.
The letter replied to the origi
nal suggestion by Kim and IN ng
that sick and wounded prisoners
he exchanged and truce negotia
tions be resumed.
Kim said in a broadcast last night
that North Korea is in "full agree
ment" with Chou's offer.
