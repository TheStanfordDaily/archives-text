### 
First hand information about the
need for blood will be delivered in
campus living groups starting to
day, when veterans arrive from Mo
ffet Field to talk during lunchtime.
The Women's Row, Lagunita, and
Roble will have five sailors and six
Marines as lunch guests today. The
veterans will talk at Union, Branner,
Encina, and Stern tonight at dinner.
Next week a different group of
servicemen back from Korea will
talk to the Eating Clubs, the Village,
Men's Row, and the off-campus men
