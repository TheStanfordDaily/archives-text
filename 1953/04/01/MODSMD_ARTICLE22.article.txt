# Peace Proposal: Part of a Pattern
## 
### 
It is encouraging to note the go-slow flag that
has been hoisted by the United States and
other UN countries following the most recent
Communist peace proposal in Korea.
Premier Chou En-Lai's dramatic radio broad
cast, just following his return from Moscow and
a meeting with the Kremlin's new first string,
may be the real McCoy and then again it may
be just another in the long line of Communist
phonies.
Nevertheless, diplomatic representatives
have wisely set their course in line with a
"show-me" attitude, waiting for a more concrete
pronouncement or an official note, delivered
according to protocol.
Typical of their hedged statements delivered
to a peace-hungry, but appeasement-chary
public was that made by the Norwegian dele
gate to the United Nations in a televised news
cast Monday evening.
"If the Communist proposal," he said in part,
"may be taken at its face value, then it con
tains the basic principles which might lead to
a settlement of the fundamental issues standing
in the way of a peace."
It has been said that the new truce proposal
is the latest in a "steadily developing peace
offensive" conducted by the new administra
tion in the Kremlin.
We are hesitant to accept this label for
the actions of the Russian government since
Stalin's death.
In the first place the several border incidents
are inconsistent with any such peace offensive.

The continuing vitriolic hot air blown off by
the Russian delegate to the United Nations is
also inconsistent with a concerted peace drive.
The border incidents, the subsequent offers
for meetings to prevent future incidents, and
this latest proposal for peace in Korea seem
rather to fall into a pattern of "feelers."
No doubt the Cominform has a far-flung es
pionage system in the world. We have had suf
ficient evidence of it in the security system
surrounding the atomic secrets.
However, much more suitable to gauging
world attitude is public reactions to matters
that receive widespread play in the press.
What is better than a bomber incident to find
out if the world is willing to take on Russia in
a war right now?
What is better than a bit of hearty peace pro
paganda to find out how far the world will go in
appeasement in order to be able to crawl back
into the shell of normalcy?
We consider the recent moves by the new
regime of the USSR as nothing more than an
attempt to get its feet on the ground in the
"cold war," the war of nerves in international
politics.
.We only hope that United Nations diplomats
can maintain their patient cautiousness long
enough for the Communists to back themselves
into a corner with one of their "feelers," a
position where they have to offer something
specific in the way of a proposal, and a position
wherein they will have to stick by an agree
ment.
