### GOSH IT'S SPRING PETE GROTHE 
In Spring a young man's fancy turns a little fancier.
â€”Anonymous
Spring was looming up in all its bright, shiny new
ness us I finished off the last few bars of Mendels
sohn's Spring Song and walked up to a bunch of kids
I knew sitting in front of the Cellar.
"The swallows have returned to Capistrano, the
pigeons have returned to Hoover Tower. Balboa has

returned to normal, and I have
returned to Stanford," I announ
ced, summoning a blare of trum
pets from the wings.
Everyone was fighting to care.
"I have returned," I repeated
to a lad who was trying to figure
out what numbers on his IBM
card meant.
He screamed, ate the, card, and
ran off.
Another friend sporting a

Hawaiian shirt the color of a three-day-old bruise,
was hiding in the corner. He was the only person
on campus who didn't have a Balboa or a Sun Val
ley tan and his milk white arms looked like two
toothpicks protruding out of a colored Easter egg.
He was sobbing gently because of this.
Sitting in the midst of my friends was a first
quarter freshman. She had just matriculated from
Marlborough, and she was singing the fifth verse
of the Marlborough Violets song.
"What happens at Stanford in Spring quarter?"
she asked.
"What happens at Stanford in Spring quarter?

What happens at Stanford in Spring quarter? Why,
everyone goes ape!"
Three econ profs, drinking coffee at one of the
tables, stopd on top of the table, beat their chests,
and chorused "Arrrooooga!!" Then they returned to
their coffee.
"You see what I mean?" I said. "Men break out
with blue denim suits with built-in Bob Mathiases
and built-women break out with technicolor Spring
dresses; no one studies; profs hold classes at Ros
sotti's; and the fish get humpback from the low
waters at Lake Lag."
"Gosh," she enthused.
"And that's not all," I pushed on. "The reserved
hook room is deader than Josef Stalin: there are
more people lying on the main libe lawn than there
are teeth in a pom pom girl's smile; and the Friday
afternoon gang at Rossoiti's is more potted than
a Ron Tomsic basket."
"Wow," she wowed.
"But," as AI Jolson used to say, you ain't heard
nothing yet. Our baseball, track, golf, and swim
ming teams have more chance of success than Al
bert Einstein in a physics class; there are more
oiled, frying bodies on the sundecks than there are
con home hours in Encina; and the grade averages
are lower than the Stanford score in the USC
game."
The frosh girl fainted into a comfortable heap on
the ground from the sheer grandeur of it all.
And so tearing up my class syllabusses and mutter
ing something about bookstore lines be damned, I
set out for Lake Lag. where I could think sweet,
tender thoughts of Stanford in Springtime.
By gosh, it's Spring.
