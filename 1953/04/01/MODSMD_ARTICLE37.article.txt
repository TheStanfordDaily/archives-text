# PUNTS AND PITCHES

### Pete Grothe 
Stanford athletics have been slightly past the stage of rigor mortis the
past two quarters, what with the basketball team claiming exclusive rights
on the league cellar and the grid squad getting cuffed on its hip pads after
a good start.
But with the melodic emergence of Spring quarter, all of this athletic
misfortune should change.
We realize that the calendar lists this as April Fool's day, but this is
no foolin' . Honest.
Let's take a quick rundown of the Spring sports situation.
(Jut at the Sunken Diamond, venerable Everett Dean is sporting the
biggest smile since lie won the national basketball championship about
a decade ago. The Indian nine clobbered USC twice in (heir home
grounds, something which hasn't been done since
Dean won't admit he has the championship sewed up, Lut everyone
else does, and some people are bold enough in terms on national honors.
With Jack Shepard, Chuck Essegjan, Warren Goodrich, and other ball
belters providing the power and Bob Murphy, Phil Page, Ken Brown, and
company providing the pitching, the baseballers should take the CIBA

in a waltz.
An even safer bet is bronzed Tom Haynie's
swim team. The mermen took fourth in the
nationals over Spring vacation and should
flatten the PCC competition like a Saturday
night. Larry Heim, who broke a national
backstroke record while placing fourth,
should spearhead the splashers with strong
assistance from Dan Osborne, Jim Lee, Jim
Gaughran, John Weiser, John Miller, and
Ash Jones.
Don't go away. There's more. People
hardly dare mention it in a louder tone
than a whisper, but our tracksters have
the best chance of whipping bated Southern
Cal this year since Haley's Comet swept
through the skies.

Although the Indians will probably lose to the Trojans they have a
good chance of placing high in the nationals, maybe second to USC.
Jack Weiershauser expects javelinist Leo Long to take first in the na
tion, and a promising kid named Mathias can pick up a few points in
about a dozen different events. Shot putter Howie Hertz, who weighs
about as much as the rest of the track team put together, miler Bob
Simon, two-miler Bob Reed, dashman Maury Parsons, and quarter-miler
Walt Garrett will all be good point-getters.
The golf team should go undefeated with Fred Brown. Warren Dailey,
and Grant Spaeth leading the way. The divotmen don't seem to know
what defeat means, until they get to the nationals.
Things look good, and that's no April fools.

Four top football prospects have enrolled in Stanford. They are not
choosing between 15 schools. They are IN Stanford, signed, scaled,
delivered with $220 on the line.
The top prospect is left half Al Napoleon, who made all-league while
going wild for Pasadena JC. Two years ago he helped spark his team
to the Little Rose Bowl victory.
Another comer is quarterback Bob Pederson, who comes from Paly
High, via Menlo and San Mateo JC. According to frosh coach Bob Ghilotti,
he is "a good runner, smart, an excellent passer, and has a good chance
of pressing Bob Garrett.
Two frosh hopefuls are center Erl Mizrahi, an All-Los Angeles gridder
from Dorsey High, and fullback Tony Sena, who gained All-City recogni
tion in San Francisco.

Another comer is quarterback Bob Pederson, who comes from Paly
High, via Menlo and San Mateo JC. According to frosh coach Bob Ghilotti,
he is "a good runner, smart, an excellent passer, and has a good chance
of pressing Bob Garrett.
Two frosh hopefuls are center Erl Mizrahi, an All-Los Angeles gridder
from Dorsey High, and fullback Tony Sena, who gained All-City recogni
tion in San Francisco.

Stanford athletics have been slightly past the stage of rigor mortis the
past two quarters, what with the basketball team claiming exclusive rights
on the league cellar and the grid squad getting cuffed on its hip pads after
a good start.
But with the melodic emergence of Spring quarter, all of this athletic
misfortune should change.
We realize that the calendar lists this as April Fool's day, but this is
no foolin' . Honest.
Let's take a quick rundown of the Spring sports situation.
(Jut at the Sunken Diamond, venerable Everett Dean is sporting the
biggest smile since lie won the national basketball championship about
a decade ago. The Indian nine clobbered USC twice in (heir home
grounds, something which hasn't been done since
Dean won't admit he has the championship sewed up, Lut everyone
else does, and some people are bold enough in terms on national honors.
With Jack Shepard, Chuck Essegjan, Warren Goodrich, and other ball
belters providing the power and Bob Murphy, Phil Page, Ken Brown, and
company providing the pitching, the baseballers should take the CIBA

in a waltz.
An even safer bet is bronzed Tom Haynie's
swim team. The mermen took fourth in the
nationals over Spring vacation and should
flatten the PCC competition like a Saturday
night. Larry Heim, who broke a national
backstroke record while placing fourth,
should spearhead the splashers with strong
assistance from Dan Osborne, Jim Lee, Jim
Gaughran, John Weiser, John Miller, and
Ash Jones.
Don't go away. There's more. People
hardly dare mention it in a louder tone
than a whisper, but our tracksters have
the best chance of whipping bated Southern
Cal this year since Haley's Comet swept
through the skies.

Although the Indians will probably lose to the Trojans they have a
good chance of placing high in the nationals, maybe second to USC.
Jack Weiershauser expects javelinist Leo Long to take first in the na
tion, and a promising kid named Mathias can pick up a few points in
about a dozen different events. Shot putter Howie Hertz, who weighs
about as much as the rest of the track team put together, miler Bob
Simon, two-miler Bob Reed, dashman Maury Parsons, and quarter-miler
Walt Garrett will all be good point-getters.
The golf team should go undefeated with Fred Brown. Warren Dailey,
and Grant Spaeth leading the way. The divotmen don't seem to know
what defeat means, until they get to the nationals.
Things look good, and that's no April fools.

Four top football prospects have enrolled in Stanford. They are not
choosing between 15 schools. They are IN Stanford, signed, scaled,
delivered with $220 on the line.
The top prospect is left half Al Napoleon, who made all-league while
going wild for Pasadena JC. Two years ago he helped spark his team
to the Little Rose Bowl victory.
