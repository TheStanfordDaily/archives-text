The Stanford baseballers notched
their fourth straight win yesterday
afternoon, blasting Compton Col
lege 15 to 0 on the Sunken Dia
mond.
Although the issue was never
in doulit in the Inpdded affair,
there was plenty of excitement,
as four Indian hurlers held the
J Tartars hitless over the first eight
[ innings.
However, in the top of the ninth,
Ed Mickelson, lead-off batter for
| Compton, slapped a ground-ball
single over second base to shatter
the hopes of a no-hitter. Bob
Murphy, who was the victim of
J Mickelson's blow, al-o surren
dered another single before he
retired the side.
Previously, only six Tartars had
reached first safely off Don De-
Long, Mike Acker, and Phi! Page,
four through walks, the other two
on errors. The pitching quartet
fanned seven.
Offensively, catcher Jack Shep
ard was the big noise for the In
dians as they smashed out 17 hits
off Mickelson. Afield, Compton also
chipped in with seven errors.
Shepard collected three singles
J in fodr at-bats and knocked in
three runs, while center fielder
Dick Cole and right fielder Al
I Talboy each collected a pair of
| hits, Cole getting a triple and
| double and Talboy a triple.
Coach Everett Dean's nine
clinched the game in the bottom of
first when they tallied two runs
dn hits by Scramaglia, Talboy, and
Shepard. They added seven more
runs on eight hits in the home-half
of the third.
