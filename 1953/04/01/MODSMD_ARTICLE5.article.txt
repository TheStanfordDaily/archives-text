# Pranksters Cause Injuries to Seven

SALT LAKE CITY, March 31
(UP) An April Fool's prank went
off prematurely here today, causing
injuries to seven persons and tying
up downtown traffic for four hours.
According to officials, pranksters
climbed the 214-foot spire of the
Mormon Temple in the center of
the city and installed an air horn
in the trumpet of the statue of the
angel Moroni.
Mormons believe the sounding of
the trumpet signals the arrival of
the Day of Judgment, and they
must be near a temple to be saved.
At. 3:30, when the horn went off,
apparently due to a short circuit
caused by high winds, an estimated
10,000 Mormons ran to the Temple
Square, trampling the gardens and
causing $4,500 damage.
