# New Study of Dr. Jordan Describes Him as Prophet
## 
### 
A new study of David Starr Jordan, first president of Stanford
University, which examines his political and social ideas by 1953
standards, has been written by Edward M. Burns, chairman of
the political science department at Rutgers University, and is
being published by Stanford University Press.

Although Jordan has had a bio
logical law and a mountain peak
named for him, and although he
won $25,000 for the best plan of
education to promote international
peace, few biographies have been
written of him save as a scientist.
He is described in the book as
one of the major prophets of his
generation—a proponent of politi
cal reform, a man who drew up a
workable plan for a world federal
republic, a forerunner of the Good
Neighbor policy and of internation
al trusteeships, and one who advo
cated that education must be the
foundation of true democracy.
As early as 1924 Jordan set forth
the view that Communism and Fas
cism were alike in the long Yun.
As early as 1914 he urged that
America should join with her
great sister republics of Canada,
Mexico, and the South American
states in an agreement to hold the
Western Hemisphere "still free
from all extension of imperialism,
claiming no rights for our citizens
not granted to all others . .
in a statement which contained
nearly every important comj¥>-
mcnt of Franklin D. Roosevelt's
Good Neighbor policy. In 1!)1(> he
made a proposal which foreshad
owed the international trustee

ship principle as it lias been
adopted hy the United Nations.
As Dr. Burns sees it, Dr. Jordan
had one contribution even greater
than these: "Better than anyone else
in his time, he disclosed the true
causes of wars, revealing them as
not merely economic but as rooted
in the very existence of sovereign
nations acting on the theory that
each must play the role of a hyena
in the midst of a pack of wolves.
' In his own country he was almost
an isolated figure, before 1918. in
exposing the fallacies of the balance
of power, of armed alliances to pre
serve peace, and of preparedness as
a preventive of wars."
The Author
Edward McNall Burns received

his A.8., I\f.A., and Ph.D. degrees
from the University of Pittsburgh.
Now chairman of the Political Sci
ence Department at Rutgers, he has
taught at that university since 1928.
His published works include "James
Madison: Philosopher of the Consti
tution," and "Western Civilizations:
Their History and Culture."

—Jordan biographer
A new study of David Starr Jordan, first president of Stanford
University, which examines his political and social ideas by 1953
standards, has been written by Edward M. Burns, chairman of
the political science department at Rutgers University, and is
being published by Stanford University Press.

Although Jordan has had a bio
logical law and a mountain peak
named for him, and although he
won $25,000 for the best plan of
education to promote international
peace, few biographies have been
written of him save as a scientist.
He is described in the book as
one of the major prophets of his
generation—a proponent of politi
cal reform, a man who drew up a
workable plan for a world federal
republic, a forerunner of the Good
Neighbor policy and of internation
al trusteeships, and one who advo
cated that education must be the
foundation of true democracy.
As early as 1924 Jordan set forth
the view that Communism and Fas
cism were alike in the long Yun.
As early as 1914 he urged that
America should join with her
great sister republics of Canada,
Mexico, and the South American
states in an agreement to hold the
Western Hemisphere "still free
from all extension of imperialism,
claiming no rights for our citizens
not granted to all others . .
in a statement which contained
nearly every important comj¥>-
mcnt of Franklin D. Roosevelt's
Good Neighbor policy. In 1!)1(> he
made a proposal which foreshad
owed the international trustee

ship principle as it lias been
adopted hy the United Nations.
As Dr. Burns sees it, Dr. Jordan
had one contribution even greater
than these: "Better than anyone else
in his time, he disclosed the true
causes of wars, revealing them as
not merely economic but as rooted
in the very existence of sovereign
nations acting on the theory that
each must play the role of a hyena
in the midst of a pack of wolves.
' In his own country he was almost
an isolated figure, before 1918. in
exposing the fallacies of the balance
of power, of armed alliances to pre
serve peace, and of preparedness as
a preventive of wars."
