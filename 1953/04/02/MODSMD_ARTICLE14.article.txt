WASHINGTON, April 1 (UP) The
State Department togi.iy welcomed
Ru-sian support of Communist
I China's bid to end-the Korean war
I but flatly opposed any Red attempt
jto switch armistice talks to the
| United Nations in New York.
Department spokesman Lincoln
| White said the United States and
J the U.N. Command have made it
| clear that any "specific" armistice
proposals must be presented at
i Panmunjom in Korea. Officials
speculated the Reds might try to
divide the Allies during a prolonged
U.N. debate.
Official quarters here were con
vinced that Russia's long - range
objective continues to be world
| domination despite a number of
conciliatory gestures in the past
few days. They cautioned flu- free
world to be on the alert for Red
counter-moves.
While some officials did not agree,
White said he did not believe Rus
sia was demanding membership in
the U.N. for Red China as a condi
tion to renewal of Korean armistice
talks. He based his statement on
Soviet Foreign Minister V. M. Mo
lotov's statement as .aired by Radio
Moscow.
Mololov said Russia fully sup
ports moves to end the Korean
war, now nearing the end of i(s
third year. Rut he added crypti
cally that the issue of Chinese
Communist and North Korean
representation in the U.N. in
connection with the peace moves
is a "burning question."
Some officials thought this k might
be a backhanded bid by Russia to
have Red China seated in the Unit
ed Nations â€”or at least be repre
sented in any peace debate there.
At the same time, White sharply
rejected any idea that Russia has
seized the jSeace "offensive."
"If they finally come along and
accept what has been put up for
years," he told reporters, "I'll be
damned if I can see how that is
Russian initiative."
