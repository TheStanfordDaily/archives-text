# Reds Set Date For Prisoner Return Talks
## 
### 
TOKYO, Thursday, April 2 (UP)
The Communists set Monday,
April 6, for opening negotiations on
the exchange of sick and wounded
war prisoners, in a liaiso'n meeting
today.
The Reds also apparently pre
sented formally to United Nations
commander Gen. Mark W. Clark
Red China's proposal for settlement
of the armistice-blocking prisoner
of war issue.
Clark agreed to the Commu
nists' call for reopening of the
top-level truce talks, with the
double proviso that this would be
a "second order of business" after
working out the sick and wound
ed exchange and that formal
truce negotiations be based on the
principle of no forced repatriation
of prisoners.
It had been conjectured that the
I Communists called today's liaison
meeting to reply to the latter por
tion of Clark's proposal, or to sub
mit formally to the United Na
tions Command Red Chinas offer
to exchange all war prisoners on
the basis of voluntary repatriation.
Clark has stated that be cannot
act on this concession by China's
Premier Chou En-lai until lie re
ccives it through Panmunjom
truce machinery. It already has
been sent to the U.N. General As
! sembly.
The Reds also must reply to
Clark's proposal that the two teams
negotiating exchange of sick and
wounded POW's be made up of offi
cers of general or admiral rank.
Clark yesterday named Rcar.Adm.
John C. Daniel, Bryn Mawr, Pa., to
head the U.N. group.
