They've seen guys in Korea
receiving plasma on the battle
field, guys whose lives are being
saved in hospitals behind the
lines—and they've been telling
Stanford about it.
They're a bunch of Marines and
Navymcn who've served in the Far
East and are now stationed at Mof
fctt Field. Working with the Blood
Drive Committee, all of them ate
lunch and talked in women's living
groups yesterday. Ten others talked
in men's and women's dorms last
night.
Next week a different group of
servicemen will talk to the clubs,
the Village, Men's Row, and the
off-campus men and women.
The serviccnicn urged their au
diences to give Mood in Stanford's
5.000-pint drive week after next.
They told about the need for
blood in Korea and the ways
they've seen it used.
They were men like:
Hospitalman 3rd class Harold
Williams, who spent the fall of 1950
in Korea. He told one living group:
"I've heard people say they weren't
sure the blood got there. Well, it

docs in one form or another —and it
saves lives."
Capt. R. C. McCarthy, a member
of a rifle platoon, who is also back
from the Far East. He saw men re
ceiving plasma out in the field . . .
•the plasma that every medical
corpsman has to carry. '
.Master Sergeant Raymond (>'-
Day, a tall, red-headed Irishman
who took part in the Inclion land
• ings. 110 recalls how their imme
diately turned their landing craft
into hospital ships.
Hospitalman 3rd class Henry Bal
lard, who served in Korea from
March, 1951, until January, 1952. He
saw them carrying scrum albumin
to the front lines where it was used
to treat shock. PjvtJ of the blood
from the Stanford <lrivfc» will be
turned into this substance, espe
cially useful in Korea since, unlike
plasma, it doesn't freeze.
Signups for the drive start next
Monday. Donors can sign up in
their living groups on campus and
in the Village or at tables on Quad.
They should plan on taking about
jan hour to give. A local anaes
; thetic helps insure that the process
i will be painless.
Donors are asked not to eat any
thing but fruit juice, black cofTec,
and dry toast for four hours before
giving. *

Most ineligibilities will be deter
mined during the drive itself, in
the medical history section of- the
Pavilion. Everyone, Is asked to sign
up cxcept those who:
1. Weifth less than 110 pounds.
2. Don't meet the age qualifi
cations (IS to 60).
Have had infectious jaundice.
Have given blood within
three months.
Have an acute cold.
(5. Are pregnant.
Girls who arc menstruating can
give after the first three days of
their period.
