# Communists Make New Peace Overtures in UN
## Russia Yields on Arms Stand; Drastic Policy Change Seen 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., April 1 (UP)â€”Russia suddenly yielded
today on its stubborn stand that has deadlocked disarmament
talks and agreed to debate atomic control and arms reduction in
the manner demanded by the West.
The Sqviet U.N. delegation, in an unexpected switch, put for-

ward an amendment to a Western
power disarmament resolution, ap
parently dropping the long-stand
ing Soviet insistence that an uncon
ditional ban on atomic weapons
must be negotiated simultaneously
with a concrete system of atomic
control.
The West always has insisted that
the atom bomb cannot be outlawed
until an airtight system of atomic
control is in effect.
At the moment, it was mainly a
paper switch in procedure. Bui it
was considered highly significant
here in the light of the recent Com
munist campaign of soft talk in tho
place of words.
The unexpected rhove came as the
U.N., by tacit consent, sidestepped
any debate on Communist China':;
Korean prisoner compromise until
next week at the earliest.
Specifically, what the Russians
did on disarmament was this:
They produced a mild amend
ment to the Western disarmament
resolution and dropped all men
tion of their own proposal, which
had been defeated in the main
political committee.
It was (he firjst time in the
memory of U.N. observers that
the Kremlin had failed to re-in
troduce, in General Assembly de
bate, the atomic proposals it had
failed to push through the po
litical committee.
Russia always has put as the first
item of disarmament a proposal for
an unconditional ban on the atomic
bomb and other weapons of mass
destruction. It has called for simul
taneous institution of international
atomic control, but the catch is, it
never has explained how full con
trol could be set up overnight in the
same motion with which the atomic
ban was proclaimed. The West
wants control set up before the ban.
The Western powers have
viewed Russian emphasis 011 art
atomic ban as a maneuver to un
dermine the West's advantage in
atomic weapons, which it feels
has been a main deterrent to
Communist aggression.
The West proposed in Paris in the
fall of 1951 that disarmament talks
start with discussion of "regulation,
limitation, and balanced reduction"
of all armaments and proceed step
by step to atomic control. Atomic
and other mass-destruction weap
ons would be outlawed only when
an airtight control system had been
put into operation.
Now, Russia apparently has ac
cepted this procedural approach -
that is, it has agreed to start talk
ing about concrete reduction of
arms and armies and leave any ban
on atomic weapons till a later stage
of negotiations.
