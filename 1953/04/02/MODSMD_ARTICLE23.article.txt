# NSA: A Good Buy for ASSU
## 
### 
Ever since the ASSU dropped out of the
National Student Association in 1950, the As
sociation has repeatedly asked Stanford to re
join.
Stanford had been a member for two years.
Its excuse for quitting was the old familiar
story: it cost too much. With yearly expenses
totaling about $1,200 for dues and other items,
and with no tangible benefits pouring in from
the National Headquarters, the ASSU came to
the conclusion that it was putting more into
NSA than it was getting out. Membership was
a "poor investment."
But before giving the NSA the usual "No,"
shouldn't we consider just what we'd be in
vesting in? If we're looking for a one way deal
where it's all take and no give, if we're in
terested primarily in the mercenary benefits
(such as cuts in theater rates) which NSA has
won for some members, if we're expecting a
lift on a mythical NSA gravy train, then mem
bership is a poor investment and we'd better
stay out.
But the Stanford student, after all, does not
think only in terms of quick, monetary re
turns on his investments. He might even like
to consider some of the goals and achieve
ments of NSA:
Besides providing a central body for the ex
change of information between colleges, NSA
is the one recognized organization through
which the students of this country may assert
their collective opinion.
Can Stanford alone oppose the McCarrar
Act before a committee of the United States
Senate? Can Stanford alone protest McCar

thyism's threat to academic freedom? Can
Stanford alone tell General Hershey that his
draft laws are poorly framed? No. But the NSA
can. And it has. Congressmen aren't likely
to pass over lightly the opinions, suggestions,
and recommendations of the NSA represent
ing the voices' of some 800,000 students.
Consider Stanford's failure to obtain the
backing of west coast colleges in bringing its
liquor resolution before the state legislature.
With concerted college action, it might have
been a different story. And had we belonged
to NSA, we might have rallied that concerted
effort.
On the international level, the NSA fosters
mutual benefit programs, especially with areas
receiving smaller shares of U.S. aid. NSA farms
out its international projects to its members,
raising funds on a short-term basis as each need
arises. Eastern schools have concentrated on
European relations; Cal plans to associate with
students in Indonesia, Ceylon, and Pakistan.
Stanford, incidentally, is being eyed by NSA
as the logical spot for a Southeast Asia institute.
Admittedly, membership in the NSA is not
going to be a money-making venture for Stan
ford. And this is a tangible loss.
But consider again the intangible profit:
1) A share in this country in the formula
tion of student opinion which is making itself
heard more strongly than ever before.
2) A share in peace-building through pro
motion of understanding with students abroad.
At $1,200, it looks like a bargain.
