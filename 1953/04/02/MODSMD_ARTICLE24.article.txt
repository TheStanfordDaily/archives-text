# STANFORD—TODAY AND TOMORROW
## Living Groups to Kick Off New Student Information Program Monday Might 
### 
With eight living group meet
ings to be held next Monday
evening, the Stanford adminis
tration and faculty will satisfy
what many students consider a
long-felt need of the student
body.
University leaders will come to
the students to talk on an informal
b;r is and answer questions on the
who, what, why, and wherefores of
Stanford's plans and policies.
Covering the general subjects of
academics, buildings and land de
velopment, and finances, 17 members
of the faculty and administration
will participate over a six week
period in the new student informa
tion program, "Stanford—Today and
Tomorrow,'' a program which was
developed from the idea of Steve
Horn, current ASSU student man
ager.
Horn observed that in recent years,
the administration and faculty mem
bers have traveled over 50.000 miles
to alumni conferences to. answer
questions on the plans and poli< i<|
of the University. During the same
period, only a few such opportunities
.•/ere offered to students on campus.
Horn, noticing this incongruity of
administrative action, went to a
roup of active alumni, the Stanford
Associates, and presented the idea
for a student information program to
the Know Your Stanford Committee
of the Associates.
Horn (lets Green Light
That committee, soaking up some
of Horn's enthusiasm, gave him a
i;ieen light to investigate further the
possibility for such a program—and
Horn did so, calling together a group
of students to act as a consultation
g rou p.
Last fall, Horn used the services of
Cardinals President Roy Alexander,
KZSU Manager Joan Coldren. De

bate Manager Dave Jacobsen, Daily
Managing Editor Walt Menninger,
Public t Relations Director Nancy
Clark, Axe Society President Sam
Freshman, and several other students
in developing ideas for such a pro
gram.
Meeting with the University Di
rectoi of Information Pete Allen,
also a member of the Associates
Know Your Stanford Committee
this group worked out ideas for the
program and submitted a report to
the Stanford Associates and to Presi
dent Wallace Sterling.
Sterling Backs Plan
Dr. Sterling gave whole-hearted
support to the program, and the

Know Your Stanford Committee of
fered financial assistance. With this
backing, at the end of fall quarter,
the consultation group of students
established a steering committee
i composed of students, faculty, and
| administration, to develop concrete
! plans and execute the student infor
mation program.
This committee, with Menninger
as student director, included Micki
Beller, of the Axe Society; Nancy
Clark; Bob James, then chairman of
I the Pre-Registration Committee; Ron
Lemcke, member of Cardinals; Alex
ander; and Horn. The faculty rep
resentatives, named by Dr. Sterling,
were John L. Mothershead, Jr.. as
sociate professor of philosophy; and
O.G. Villard, Jr., associate professor
of electrical engineering.
Along with Pete Allen, James Tri
olo, assistant to the General Secre
tary, served as a for
the administration.
Trial Program
This steering committee met week
ly during winter quarter to work
out the program for "Stanford—To
day and Tomorrow." With ideas for
a long-range, continuous program to
be started next fall, the committee
decided that a trial program would
be most suitable for this quarter.
Thirty meetings were scheduled
on the living group level for the pur
pose of evaluating the idea for this
program and of sampling student
interest in the program. The gen
eral University administration was
broken down into three major sub
jects: academics, buildings and land
development, and finances.
Experts in each of the fields of the
University administration are going
to participate in the program, visit
ing various living group sessions. At
the same time. The Daily will feature
a series of informative articles on
the University program of "Stan

WALT MENNINGER
—A need siltisfi#*<l
With eight living group meet
ings to be held next Monday
evening, the Stanford adminis
tration and faculty will satisfy
what many students consider a
long-felt need of the student
body.
University leaders will come to
the students to talk on an informal
b;r is and answer questions on the
who, what, why, and wherefores of
Stanford's plans and policies.
Covering the general subjects of
academics, buildings and land de
velopment, and finances, 17 members
of the faculty and administration
will participate over a six week
period in the new student informa
tion program, "Stanford—Today and
Tomorrow,'' a program which was
developed from the idea of Steve
Horn, current ASSU student man
ager.
Horn observed that in recent years,
the administration and faculty mem
bers have traveled over 50.000 miles
to alumni conferences to. answer
questions on the plans and poli< i<|
of the University. During the same
period, only a few such opportunities
.•/ere offered to students on campus.
Horn, noticing this incongruity of
administrative action, went to a
roup of active alumni, the Stanford
Associates, and presented the idea
for a student information program to
the Know Your Stanford Committee
of the Associates.
Horn (lets Green Light
That committee, soaking up some
of Horn's enthusiasm, gave him a
i;ieen light to investigate further the
possibility for such a program—and
Horn did so, calling together a group
of students to act as a consultation
g rou p.
Last fall, Horn used the services of
Cardinals President Roy Alexander,
KZSU Manager Joan Coldren. De

bate Manager Dave Jacobsen, Daily
Managing Editor Walt Menninger,
Public t Relations Director Nancy
Clark, Axe Society President Sam
Freshman, and several other students
in developing ideas for such a pro
gram.
Meeting with the University Di
rectoi of Information Pete Allen,
also a member of the Associates
Know Your Stanford Committee
this group worked out ideas for the
program and submitted a report to
the Stanford Associates and to Presi
dent Wallace Sterling.
Sterling Backs Plan
Dr. Sterling gave whole-hearted
support to the program, and the

Know Your Stanford Committee of
fered financial assistance. With this
backing, at the end of fall quarter,
the consultation group of students
established a steering committee
i composed of students, faculty, and
| administration, to develop concrete
! plans and execute the student infor
mation program.
This committee, with Menninger
as student director, included Micki
Beller, of the Axe Society; Nancy
Clark; Bob James, then chairman of
I the Pre-Registration Committee; Ron
Lemcke, member of Cardinals; Alex
ander; and Horn. The faculty rep
resentatives, named by Dr. Sterling,
were John L. Mothershead, Jr.. as
sociate professor of philosophy; and
O.G. Villard, Jr., associate professor
of electrical engineering.
Along with Pete Allen, James Tri
olo, assistant to the General Secre
tary, served as a for
the administration.
Trial Program
This steering committee met week
ly during winter quarter to work
out the program for "Stanford—To
day and Tomorrow." With ideas for
a long-range, continuous program to
be started next fall, the committee
decided that a trial program would
be most suitable for this quarter.
Thirty meetings were scheduled
on the living group level for the pur
pose of evaluating the idea for this
program and of sampling student
interest in the program. The gen
eral University administration was
broken down into three major sub
jects: academics, buildings and land
