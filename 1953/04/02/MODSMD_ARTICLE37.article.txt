# Shepard Can't Stop Hitting in the Clutch
## 
### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
Off his performance ol the past
weekend against USC. and because
of his consistent slugging during
the .spring recess, Jack Shepard,
backstop and holler-guy of Ever
ett Dean's baseball team, rates the
call as the Daily's "Athlete of the
Week."
Down in the Southland last week'
end, Big Jack collected four hits in
eight trips to the plate, including a
home run, as he led the Indians to
a paii - of very satisfying victories
over the perennial champs, USC.

Shepard now roosts atop the
CIBA batting race with a .500 bat
ting average. Moreover, he also
tops the Stanford team with a .448
average, having gathered 150 hits in
07 at-bats. With these 30 hits, he
has driven across an identical num
ber of runs
Ever since he arrived at the Farm
four years ago, Jack has been slap
ping the ball all over the Sunken
Diamond. His fine hitting made it
imperative that he b<* placed some
where in the lineup from the first
game of his freshman year. He has
played catcher, first base, and out
field, and is considered by Coach
Dean the best catcher and one of
the best all-around players in Stan
ford history. He is a splendid re
ceiver with a fine throwing arm,
and he handles his pitchers beau
tifully. He is at his best in the
clutch.
His .sophomore year, his finest to
date, Shepard really went to town.
While playing the outfield, he led
the team with a .368 average, led
in extra base hits, and was named

the most valuable player on the
squad.
Shepard has never known a
poor season in college iiasehall.
I.ast year he "hit the depths" with
a .339 average, while leading the
team in the KBI column with 37.
Jack hit with power as well as
with consistency. He has hit three
home runs out of the spacious Stan
lord Diamond, more than any other
player with the exception of team
mate Chuck Essegian, who has
belted nine.
Shepard, now a senior, lias had
several offers from major and minor
league teams alike. He would like
to play professional ball during the
summer, and attend business school
at Stanford during the off season.
Prohahiy the most satisfactory
moment in Shep's baseball ca
reer was a 12-11 victory over
1(1 A last year. After losing
three straight to the Bruins, the
Indians were trailing once again
by two runs in the last of the
ninth. Shepard triplvd home one
run and moments later scored the
tying run to send the affair into
extra innings. In the 11th, with
the Indians trailing again, he sin
gled home two runs, stole second,
and came home with the winning
run.
