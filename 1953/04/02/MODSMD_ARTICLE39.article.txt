# TRACK PROSPECTUS:
## Nothing to Fear But Fear Itself' 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
An eager bunch of dust-eaters
who spend their spare time
romping around Angell Field in
their BVD's just might be Stan
ford's great, all-time track team
—all they have to do is beat SC.
To do this, a major miracle and
a few 21 -flat furlong men, sprin
kled with a health jag on the
part of all, will be needed.
"Optimist!!!" you call; nothing
of the sort. AH any track team
has to do to become the "all
time greatest" is to beat SC.
Stanford has been putting out
good track teams for 20 years
which have been trying to per
petrate this small feat, and all
have failed. SC is great in track.
Meanwhile, across the Bay,
the lair of the Golden Bear is
ahiMle with eager youngsters
with the same idea in mind,
and Bay Area sportsmen seem
to feel they have a better
chance. In fact, they have us
losing to both the Trojans and
Bears in the pre-season pros
pectus. Terrifying, isn't it?
Fortunately for the Stanfords,
the Bay Area experts have been
wrong in the past. The situation
sets up .something like this:
In the sprints, Stanford has a
potent duo in Keith Brownsber
ger and Maury Parsons, 9.7 and
( J.B respectively in the hundred
and 21.4 and 21.5 in the 220.
Cal and the Bears have men that
can equal this performance on
any given day, but none as con
sistent. Blackburn of Cal is
probably the top sprinter in the
nation if he can ever return to
form. Bob McGee will try to du
plicate his 9.7 of last year if he
can ever get back in shape.
In the 440, Stanford is fair but
SC and Cal are strong. Fred
George, Bill Friedrichs, and Walt
Garrett are all capable of crack
ing 49. SC's Lea and Hendrix
adn Cal's Spurrier, Timmerman,
and Stewart ali post better times.
In the half-mile, Cal's Spurrier
(1:51.4) and Nelson (1:54.4) are
capable of taking first and sec
ond against Stanford, while

Stanford's Bob Simon (1:54.8),
Frosty Phillips, and Dave Fletch
er are capable of sweeping
through SC. This and the jave
lin are probably the Trojans'
weakest events.
The mile is another story.
Simon, with 4:12. S last year
and 4:21!) so far this year,
should waltz away from every
one. If Bob Reed can take on
both the mile and two-mile,
hi, 4:18.6 as a frosh last year
might be enough to take sec
ond across the board.
In the two-mile, Reed's best
last year, 9:24.4 should go all
the way in the PCC and pretty
far in the nationals. Further
more, Simon is capable of hitting
in the 9:2o's if he should take, on
the two-mile grind.
In the hurdles, Stanford's
"white hope," Bob Mathias, may
just be the man to lead the
Cards on to greatness. Mathias,
double decathlon winner fund
world record holder in this most
grueling of tests of physical
stamina, has season bests of 14.5
and 23.7 in the highs and lows
respectively, which are almost
equal to Jack Davis of SC.
Davis has hit 13.7 and 23 fiat.
Mathias has a 13.8 knocked off
at Zurich, Switzerland, after the
Olympic Games and while in the
best condition of his life. Davis's
speed should make it easy in the
lows, but MathiaS's form could
make the highs uncomfortable.
After Mathias, both Cal and
SC could run wild.
In the field events, Howie
Hertz should take first in the
shot against Cal and second be
hind SC's Parry O'Brien. Amer
ica's Olympic champ, and ten of
SC's 28 Olympic points (O'Brien
and Inncs took firsts and Davis
took a second).
Mathias (again) should be able
to take a second against Cal and
a third against Troy.
In the discus, Big Bob's 173-4
should beat Cal and take second
behind Sim Iness in the PCC's.
Mathias took first two years ago.
Iness took first last year, and

Parry O'Brien (again) should
L-op third or possibly second if
Mathias is off top form.
In (he javelin, (he Cards'
team of Leo Long, Bob Kim
ball, and (.buck Harlow should
sweep SC and have nothing to
wi.'.ry alxjut except Sam Ad
ams of Cal. All three are ca
pable of topping 2(10 feet on
(lie same day.
In the broad jump, Pete Mc-
Kay's best of 23-7 puts him
but four short inches behind
SC's Sorgen and Cal's Steve
Turner. He should be good for
at least second in both meets.
In the pole vault, both SC and
Stanford will be lucky to get
anyone over 13 feet. Cal has
Seeds and Anderson, both over
13-0. The high jump looks good
against UC, but SC has three
men over f> -3. They could
sweep.
