##

Associate Editor, The Daily
Excom is once again consider
ing the question of whether Stan
ford should belong to the Na
tional Studetit Association. A
member for two years, Stanford
dropped out in 1950 on the
grounds that membership ex
penses were too costly.
There was also a fear that Com
munists had infiltrated the ranks of
NSA.
At the end of last quarter, stu
dent body presidents of three
schools belonging to NSA appeared
before Excom to answer questions
on the pros and cons of membership
in NSA. They were Marty Rosen of
UCLA, Dick Holler of Cal, and
Lowell Vye of Mills.
Here are some of the questions

posed lo them by Excom members
and the answers they gave:
Q: How did NSA start?
A: NSA was started in 1947 by
a group of veterans who had ob
served student unions in other
countries during the war.
Q: What docs it do?
A: NSA's main functions are
centralizing the exchange of infor
mation between colleges and pro
viding a nationally recognized
voice by which the students of this
country may assert their collective
opinion.
Q: What about work oil the in
ternational level?
A: The NSA carries on exchange
programs with students abroad,
sponsors mutual benelit programs
with areas which receive little aid
from the State Department.
There are NSA members on U.N.
educational committees right now.
In the foreign benefit program,
NSA farms out projects to member

schools. For instance, schools in the
Eastern U.S. work with European
universities, while Cal is associated
with students in fndonesia, Ceylon,
and Pakistan.
Q: Who pays fui*> programs like
these?
A: The school that takes on the
project accepts the bulk of the re
sponsibility. But the NSA chips in
with what it can, raising money on
a short - term basis as each new
need arises. On occasions, the Ford
Foundation has helped NSA finan
cially.
Q: What about the talk of Com
munists in NSA?
A: It is completely unfounded.
In fact, NSA presents a non-Com
munist front which has been criti
cized for being too conservative.
NSA was originally a member of
the International Union of Students,
but severed relations with it after
attempts to co-operate with the
Communists within lUS did not

work out.
Q: Has NSA ever been investi
gated?
A: Yes. In 1952 NSA was re
viewed and cleared oy a Congres
sional committee. It has never been
blacklisted or cited.
Q: What is the National Student
Congress?
A: The Congress is composed of
the representatives of the member
schools of NSA who meet annually
for more than a week. They hold
practical training sessions for stu
dent government and decide NSA
policy and program for the coming
year. The Congress elects NSA's
national officers.
Q: Who determines NSA policy?
A: National policy is determined
by the National Student Congress.
Emergency decisions during the
year are made at meetings of the
National Executive Committee.
Q: How does the NSA stand po
litically?
A: The NSA steers clear ol" party
politics. But it takes stands on na
tional issues of concern to students.
For example at the National Con
gress in 1950, student delegations
passed resolutions condemning Mc-
Carthyism, endorsing the principle
of federal aid to education, and rec
ommending draft deferments for
college students.
Q: What happens after NSA
takes a stand?
A: NSA doesn't have a lobby in
Washington. But we let our posi
tion be known. We send official
communications to members of

Congress and the papers usually j
give our views u pretty good air
ing?
Q: Ilnw does the XSA fit into
local school government?
A: Each member of the student
body automatically becomes an
NSA member. The student body I
then elects, or the Executive Com
mittee appoints, one student as NSA
co-ordinator. In most cases he is
given a vote on the school's Excom.
Q: What would it cost Stanford
to join?
A: Dues are proportionate to en
rollment. Stanford's national dues
—$125, plus regional dues of $85 —
would total about $210. Sending
delegates to the National Congresses
held in the Midwest or East is the
main expense.
Q: Where do our national dues
go?
A: The bulk of the national funds
go for publications and pamphlets.
These dues also pay the salaries of
the three persons on the national
staff. Two of them are full time
and receive $1,200 a year.
Q: What arc the obligations of
member schools to carry out NSA
programs on their campuses?
A: Each individual school exer- |
cises local autonomy. Any NSA- 1
sponsored program would become
effective on your campus only if J
approved and instituted by your j
Excom or student body.
