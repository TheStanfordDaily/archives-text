# NATIONAL STUDENT ASSOCIATION
## Excom Refers Membership Question to Committee 
### HADLEY ROFF 
Associate Editor, The Daily
Judging by the opinions expressed at last nignt's Lrxcom meet
ing, campus opinion seems to be fairly well divided on the ques
tion: Should Stanford join the National Student Association.
Much of the discussion, which lasted for more than two hours,
pointed up the fact that few of the Excom members are really

"informed about the precise nature
of the organization.
Student Body President Dick
Weismann, in an unusual move,
called on each Excom representa
tive to express his views on the
controversial group. The views ex
pressed were as varied as the col
ors in this morning's sunrise.
The lengthy discussion resolved
itself, at least temporarily, when
Excom acted on a motion by Fran
Kirk, Village representative, and
referred the question to the NSA
committee of Excom for further
study and recommendation.
Steve Horn, Student Manager
and cx-officio member of Excom,
energetically stressed that Ex
com must act slowly in consider
ing membership in the organiza
tion and find out in detail about
(he group. Horn emphasized that
the ultimate question on NSA
should be submitted to referen
dum.
He also said, "To me the internal
structure of the organization reeks."
Others joining the sometimes
heated discussion were not so caus
tic in their criticism.
Toni Tribble, Women's Row rep
resentative, for one advocated that
Stanford join the group, saying that
the abstract value involved in the
exchange of ideas between cam
puses is of "extreme importance."
Hal Hollister, senior representa
tive, said, "I'm afraid of such a
powerful organization," and urged
that the student body not join.
One of the chief questions dis
cussed was the financial require
ments involved. But like much else
in the discussion there was little
concrete information. Horn opined
that total costs for the year would
be over $1,000. Weismann, however,
said he thought the cost would be
less.
