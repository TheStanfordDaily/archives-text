# SC, UCLA Test Card Nine Title Hopes
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Old-timers are saying that
this may be Stanford's best
all-time baseball team.
The league-leading Indians
will be given full opportunity
to prove or disprove this the
ory when they face the venge
ful onslaught of USC and
UCLA bats in a trio of tussles

this weekend.
Everett Dean's nine host the
hated Trojans at 3:15 p.m. today
and then lock horns with the
hustling Bruins in a 1:150 double
* header tomorrow.
The Cards bopped Southern Cal
twice last weekend, 7 to 1 and
5 to 2, the first time this has been
done since 1939. The USCers
shouldn't be too much of a nui
sance today, since they h#/e lost
most of last year's stars.

Everett Dean said today's start
er will be either Bob Murphy,
Ken Brown, or Don DeLong. Don
Young will pitch for USC. Phil
Page will toe the mound tomor
row, with one of the above-named
starting the other end of the
double-header.
The big question mark of this
year's squad was the hurling.
This question mark, to a good
extent, has been erased. Bob
Murphy, erratic last year, has
been superb this season. He

held the Sacramento Solons to
one run for nine innings and he
decisioned the Oakland Acorns,
4 to 3. This is better than good
for a college chucker, and the
scouts are readying their check
books for Murph.
The hitting, as expected, has
come through in grand style.
Catcher Jack Shepard has been
pounding *" the ball something
fierce, and is in a tie for the
league batting lead with UCLA's
Ted Narleski with a .500 average.

Shep has .448 for the season
with first baseman Hal Ilennacy,
he of the fancy glove, averaging
.333. Short Warren Goodrich is
pounding the apple at a .329 clip,
and Al Talboy has a .324 mark.
Left fielder Chuck Essegian is still
muscling homers out of the park
with frightening regularity, but
his all-over average is very dis
appointing . . . .230.
The team's batting average is
.285 as compared to the oppo
nents' .195.

Coach Art Reichle's Bruins will
provide 'Stanford with a stiffer
test than the Trojans. UCLA has
a onc-and-one record in CIBA
play, having split with Santa
Clara.
Verlyn Crook and Dick Gilson
will throw against the Indians.
UCLA's top pitcher, Bob Decker,
will expend himself against Cal
today. The Bruin batting attack
will be spearheaded by Narleski,
left fielder Ron Gerst, and center
fielder Hal Crow.
