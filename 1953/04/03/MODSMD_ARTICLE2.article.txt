## 4-Power Berlin Meeting Hints German Unification 
### 
BERLIN, April 2 (UP) â€”An Anglo-Soviet meeting on air safety
today blossomed suddenly into a Big Four conference shaping
up as the first move in a Russian drive for an overall agreement.
Gen. Vassily I. Chiukov, Soviet Commander in Germany, asked
the United States and France to join the air conference. Both

promptly accepted. It will be the
first four-power meeting lictc sincc
May, 1951.
Allied officials said it seemed
Jikely the Russians planned to use
the air conference as a wedge to
introduce a new proposal on Ger
many and widen the talks to cover
the whole German problem.
A few hours after the move by
Chiukov, UP correspondent Hen
ry Shapiro reported from Moscow
through the Russian censorship:
"The Soviet government is ex
pected to renew proposals for the
unification of Germany on the
basis of the organization of an
all-German government and free
elections under the supervision of
the occupying powers, diplomatic
circles said today.
"Should the Korean problem he
solved, the Kremlin will make an
all-out effort to work out a global
settlement, these quarters be
lieve."
Earlier Soviet overtures on Ger
man unity have been rebuffed by
the West because the terms were
unacceptable. But now officials here
cxpected any new Soviet offers to
make concessions in line with those
on Koxea and disarmament.
The main stumbling block has
been Soviet refusal to guarantee
free German elections to establish
an all-German unified government.
