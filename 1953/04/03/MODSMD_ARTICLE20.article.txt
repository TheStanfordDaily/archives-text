TOKYO, Friday, April 3 (UP) â€”
Chinese Communists hit South Ko
reans on the central front yesterday
with the biggest attack since start of
their "peace offensive" and were
driven back with heavy losses.
The .Communists, apparently co
ordinating battle action with truce
moves, concentrated almost entirely
on South Korean positions, and
made only tentative jabs at Ameri
can and other Allied outposts.
