# 'On Your Word...'
## 
### 
"On your word as a Stanford gentleman"
—that's how you pledge your testimony before
the Council for Student Control. You do not
"swear to tell the whole truth, etc."—your word
as a Stanford gentleman is sufficient.
In essence, this is the foundation for the
Honor Code itself. Signatures beneath "no un
permitted aid given or received" and "Honor
Code Observed," are made by Stanford men
and women and are trusted as such.
In spite of the majority of Standfordites who
justify the University's faith in them, we recog
nize that there are a few Honor Code violators.
For this reason, the Council for Student Control,
composed of the members of Men's Wom
en's Councils, is empowered to hear Honor
Code cases, render verdicts, and hand down
sentences on offenders.
Now, however, we must recognize some
thing more: the Council for Student Control is
not performing its functions fully, ft is charged
with hearing all honor code violations, but,
through no fault of its own, it is only hearing
some of them.
A freshman's letter to-the-editor appeared
in The Daily this week, deploring the fact that
books were stolen from the Western Civ Libe
last quarter, while innocent people paid the
fines for them when they became overdue.
But book thievery was not only confined to

the Western Civ Libe last quarter, for at least
one book on reserve for a poly sci class was
stolen when theTe were only a few for a class
of 50.
Added to these book thefts are persisting
rumors about students who take their tests
home and then abuse this privilege by cheat
ing with the aid of textbook or class notes.
Is the Honor Code breaking down? We think
not. But we do feel that one aspect of the Code
is losing its significance for a lot of people:
Third Person Responsibility.
This responsibility cannot be shrugged off
-—to ignore it is to violate the Honor Code as
seriously as does a student who cheats during a
lest. Anyone who fails to report a violation may
be tried by the Council for Student Control
for violating the Honor Code.
Closing your eyes to violations and making
disparaging remarks about how the Honor
Code is functioning is easy. Turning in some
one you know is hard.
But letting violations continue unchecked, en
couraging new violators by such examples,
undermining one of Stanford's most treasured
possessions, should be even harder for any
student worthy of belonging to the Stanford
family.
It should b* 3 impossible for a Stanford gentle
man. —Mary Massey

disparaging remarks about how the Honor
Code is functioning is easy. Turning in some
one you know is hard.
But letting violations continue unchecked, en
couraging new violators by such examples,
undermining one of Stanford's most treasured
possessions, should be even harder for any
student worthy of belonging to the Stanford
family.
It should b* 3 impossible for a Stanford gentle
man. —Mary Massey
"On your word as a Stanford gentleman"
—that's how you pledge your testimony before
the Council for Student Control. You do not
"swear to tell the whole truth, etc."—your word
as a Stanford gentleman is sufficient.
In essence, this is the foundation for the
Honor Code itself. Signatures beneath "no un
permitted aid given or received" and "Honor
Code Observed," are made by Stanford men
and women and are trusted as such.
In spite of the majority of Standfordites who
justify the University's faith in them, we recog
nize that there are a few Honor Code violators.
For this reason, the Council for Student Control,
composed of the members of Men's Wom
en's Councils, is empowered to hear Honor
Code cases, render verdicts, and hand down
sentences on offenders.
Now, however, we must recognize some
thing more: the Council for Student Control is
not performing its functions fully, ft is charged
with hearing all honor code violations, but,
through no fault of its own, it is only hearing
some of them.
A freshman's letter to-the-editor appeared
in The Daily this week, deploring the fact that
books were stolen from the Western Civ Libe
last quarter, while innocent people paid the
fines for them when they became overdue.
But book thievery was not only confined to

the Western Civ Libe last quarter, for at least
one book on reserve for a poly sci class was
stolen when theTe were only a few for a class
of 50.
Added to these book thefts are persisting
rumors about students who take their tests
home and then abuse this privilege by cheat
ing with the aid of textbook or class notes.
Is the Honor Code breaking down? We think
not. But we do feel that one aspect of the Code
is losing its significance for a lot of people:
Third Person Responsibility.
This responsibility cannot be shrugged off
-—to ignore it is to violate the Honor Code as
seriously as does a student who cheats during a
lest. Anyone who fails to report a violation may
be tried by the Council for Student Control
for violating the Honor Code.
Closing your eyes to violations and making
disparaging remarks about how the Honor
Code is functioning is easy. Turning in some
one you know is hard.
