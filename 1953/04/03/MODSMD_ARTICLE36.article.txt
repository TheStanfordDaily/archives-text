# Afternoons in the Bleachers

Stanford has had its nose rubbed in the dirt
of The Palo Alto Times sports page just about
long enough.
In several columns during the past while,
Larry Cahn, former sports editor of The Daily,
has bemoaned the fact that the student body
doesn't seem to give a hang about what the
athletic teams are doing.
We cannot take offense at what Larry has
been saying, because, with the exception of
football and to a degree basketball, what he
has been saying is true.
The average student doesn't care two bits
worth if tho crew practices 24 hours a day, and
he really doesn't give a hoot how the guys on
the swimming team or tennis team come out,
providing, that is, they win everything in sight.
However, we are not sitting at the editor's
desk to take the cat 'o nine tails to the back of
everyone who doesn't follow the flailing of the
golf team, stroke by stroke.
As in every worthwhile subject, there are
two sides to the question. While we naturally,
as a fan and player from way back, hold to the
proposition that (here is no better way to soak
up the sun than to play or watch some sport,
it seems only fair to explore the viewpoint of
the lovers of the great indoors.
After all, sports teams in a university that
doesn't profess to promote commercial athletics
are mainly for the benefit of the men that par
ticipate. They enjoy playing or they wouldn't
be doing it. They are the people, if any, who
stand to gain something tangible.
But there are two chief arguments for follow
ing a team, for going to watch it play.
The first of course is entertainment. It's fun
to watch a ball game or a tennis match. If it
were not fun, then there's no reason at all to

spend the time.
Stanford athletes are not hairy monsters who
are lodged in separate pens and gain their
class units by serving as lab specimens in
psych classes. Each athlete is just another
Joe Student.
Hearing, "Hey, Mulligan, you corned thai
one!" or "Good blow, Joe" is definitely cheer
ing when you hear it from a buddy. It is
something entirely different from a lot of noise
that goes up in smoke from an impersonal
"rooting" section.
All of which seems to be plenty of reason
for packing the Sunken Diamond stands while
the baseball team clobbers its way to the PCC
pennant, for taking up some of the storage
space in Stanford Stadium while the track team
takes its ups and downs, and for dropping off
along the way to watch a little swimming, ten
nis, golf, or even spring football.

everyone who doesn't follow the flailing of the
golf team, stroke by stroke.
As in every worthwhile subject, there are
two sides to the question. While we naturally,
as a fan and player from way back, hold to the
proposition that (here is no better way to soak
up the sun than to play or watch some sport,
it seems only fair to explore the viewpoint of
the lovers of the great indoors.
After all, sports teams in a university that
doesn't profess to promote commercial athletics
are mainly for the benefit of the men that par
ticipate. They enjoy playing or they wouldn't
be doing it. They are the people, if any, who
stand to gain something tangible.
But there are two chief arguments for follow
ing a team, for going to watch it play.
The first of course is entertainment. It's fun
to watch a ball game or a tennis match. If it
were not fun, then there's no reason at all to

spend the time.
Stanford athletes are not hairy monsters who
are lodged in separate pens and gain their
class units by serving as lab specimens in
psych classes. Each athlete is just another
Joe Student.
Hearing, "Hey, Mulligan, you corned thai
one!" or "Good blow, Joe" is definitely cheer
ing when you hear it from a buddy. It is
something entirely different from a lot of noise
that goes up in smoke from an impersonal
"rooting" section.
All of which seems to be plenty of reason
for packing the Sunken Diamond stands while
the baseball team clobbers its way to the PCC
pennant, for taking up some of the storage
space in Stanford Stadium while the track team
takes its ups and downs, and for dropping off
along the way to watch a little swimming, ten
nis, golf, or even spring football.
Stanford has had its nose rubbed in the dirt
of The Palo Alto Times sports page just about
long enough.
In several columns during the past while,
Larry Cahn, former sports editor of The Daily,
has bemoaned the fact that the student body
doesn't seem to give a hang about what the
athletic teams are doing.
We cannot take offense at what Larry has
been saying, because, with the exception of
football and to a degree basketball, what he
has been saying is true.
The average student doesn't care two bits
worth if tho crew practices 24 hours a day, and
he really doesn't give a hoot how the guys on
the swimming team or tennis team come out,
providing, that is, they win everything in sight.
However, we are not sitting at the editor's
desk to take the cat 'o nine tails to the back of
everyone who doesn't follow the flailing of the
golf team, stroke by stroke.
