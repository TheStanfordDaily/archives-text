# Missing Coke Bottles

### 
The Coca-Cola bottling company represent
ative has reported to us, as well as to the campus
police, one of the most ingenious and certainly
one of the cheapest types of crimes a petty hood
can dream up.
It seems that a person or persons, unknown
but suspected, have been pilfering empty bot
tles from the coke machine racks and taking
them to Palo Alto stores to redeem the deposits.
The Coke man said that in a recent week he
lost four cases of bottles this way, which at
$2.50 a case came to a $10 loss.
The Coke man has his suspicions, the police
have thejrs, but neither one desires to get any
body in grief because of such a nuisance crime.
Their advice and ours is simply to cut it out.
