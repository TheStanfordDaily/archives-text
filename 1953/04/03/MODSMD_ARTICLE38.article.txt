# CAMPUS OPINION
## Editorial Responsibility 
### 
To the Editor:
It would seem that any editorial written in a student
newspaper may function it; three ways. It could
either be representative of overall student opinion,
or it could characterize the opinions of the editor,
or it might combine the two functions already men
tioned.
Since the editorial in Wednesday's Daily offers
no evidence of being representative of overall student
opinion. I presume that it is a document for which
the editor is solely responsible.
But is there then any editorial responsibility of a
student editor on a student paper? I feel there is.
It is not the responsibility of an editor to the owners
or advertisers of a private newspaper, or to some po
litical party or trade union. It is simply a responsi
bility to the ideal of consistent thought which values
truth and the methods by which truth is discovered.
Although this can be clearly grasped, it may be
difficult to carry out since the results may run counter
to public opinion. But it is a responsibility which
a good student editor must maintain, notwithstand
ing results I feel that this responsibility has been
violated in the editorial in question.
The first half of the editorial seems to take it as a
foregone conclusion that the newest communist peace
proposal is a propaganda move wiih hostile motives.
Otherwise, why is it felt (as the editor remarks) that,
"It is encouraging to note the go-slow flag that has
been hoisted by the United States and other UN
countries following the most recent communist peace
proposal in Korea," or that, "diplomatic representa
tives have wisely set their course in line with a
'show-me' attitude."
My point here is not to question whether it is
true that this recent peace proposal is a propaganda

move, but rather to question the reasons offered in
the editorial to show that this is so.
Two basic reasons are offered. The first mentions
the constant criticism of the communist delegates in
the UN. This criticism has been directed mainly
against policies proposed by the U.S. If this is to be
taken as evidence against the possibility of a genu
ine peace move, then the U.S. must be presumed
to be against peace as well. Our delegates in the past
few years have been as belligerent toward Russia
as the Russians have been toward us. Either this
belligerence is not evidence of bad faith in respect
to the present international situation, or we have to
be considered political hypocrites too.
The second reason offered is the recent air clash
es. The "bomber incident" which the editor notes
is interesting, since the official about the
plane being on a routine weather fltjrfit is inconsist
ent with the report of Congressman Flanders, who
pointed out that no routine weather flights are made
in the vicinity of the clash, and routine weather
planes do not carry guns*.
The official version of the incident over the Czech-
West German border is also in doubt, since the state
ments made by the pilots of our planes seem to
indicate that they were inside the Czech border two
or three minutes before the interception took place.
The judgments therefore, made in the first half
of the editorial, carry no weight, except to evoke !
approval on irrational grounds, or to appeal to in
dividuals who enjoy reading what they like to hear
with no questions asked.
Whatever may be said about official reports, it is
fairly clear that editorial comments made on April 1 !
were without support. If the editor want> to sus
tain the present inflammatory situation, let him do
so with good arguments.
