clearing the bar at 0 ft. 5 in. He
is backed by Larry Keftey, who
hails from Lincoln High of San

despite the loss of Jtvry Angove
for tomorrow's meet. John Wha
len and Bill Flint have both
looked good topping 12 feet. An
gove, out because of a tonsil op
eration, cleared 12 ft. (i in. in

Three frosh gridders will pro
vide the strength in the shot put.
Jim Truher, who will be compet
ing in four events, is the Papooses'
top man, having hit 47 ft. 2 in. He
is followed by Tom Polich and Bob
Pirke, both capable of heaving in
