Stanford's powerful golf team will
face two foes this weekend.

off against Cal at the Mira Vista

crew should beat them handily.

meets the Cards on Saturday,
should be a tougher foe. They play
the Stanford course week in and
week out and form a rough crew.

holder of the course record of 63.
The two teams will tee off at 9.
Stanford's line-up will probably
consist of Fred Brown, Warren Dai
ley, Grant Spaeth, Art Schroeder,
