## Cindermen in Home Debut With Triangular Meet 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
Stanford's 1953 track team makes
its home debut in Stanford Stadium
tomorrow vs. the Olympic Club,
San Jose State, and the newly
formed Santa Clara Youth Center.
Field events for the varsity start
at 1:30, running events at 2. Fresh
man races will be run alternately
with the varsity.
A total of eight track teams will
be present on the field as the fresh
men also have a quadrangular meet
with East Contra Costa. The quad
rangular meet should feature top
men three deep in almost every
event.
For Stanford," this is the big test
before the big meet with SC the
following weekend. Last weekend,
the Youth Center and San Jose
clashed with Cal and COP in a
quadrangular meet at Berkeley. Cal
won with a total of 75V2 points, SJS
was second with 40V2, and the
i Youth Center was close behind with
j 38.
Track enthusiasts will be able to
see some of the top track and iield
performers in the West compete in
the meet. Olympic pole vaulter
George Mattos of the Youth Cen
ter and formerly of San Jose State
has a 14-8 to his credit and won his
specialty at 14-4 last weekend.
Wyatt, another ex - Spartan,
should take another first in the
high jump for the Santa boys. In
the sprints, the Youth Center has
John George, winner of both
dashes in the 11)52 Big Meet for
! Cal, and George Roseme, also ex-
Cal. with a 213-foot best in the
javelin.
The Olympic Club has Sherm
Miller and Ted Rupprecht, both ex
j Oxy, in the 220 and either hundred
| or quarter, depending on their con
dition. Ex-Stanfordites Bud Held in
! the javelin and Otis Chandler in the
i shot should be easy favorites to
romp home first in their specialties.
San Jose State will be sparked by
j Lang Stanley, prep half-mile rec
! ord holder at 1:53.6. Stanley
j shocked the experts by topping
Cal's Ron Spurrier last weekend,
after being in bed all week with the
j flu.
j Stanford's Bob Simon will
probably go in the half and mile
while Bob Reed will handle two
mile chores. Bob Mathias will
romp over both hurdles, the dis
cus, and shot put. If all goes well v
he should take three firsts and a
third in the shot.
Stanford's tremendous trio of jav
elin throwers, Leo Long, Bob Kim
ball, and Chuck Harlow, may be
completely shut out by Held and Cy
Young of the Olympic Club and Ro
seme of the Youth Center.

formed Santa Clara Youth Center.
Field events for the varsity start
at 1:30, running events at 2. Fresh
man races will be run alternately
with the varsity.
A total of eight track teams will
be present on the field as the fresh
men also have a quadrangular meet
with East Contra Costa. The quad
rangular meet should feature top
men three deep in almost every
event.
For Stanford," this is the big test
before the big meet with SC the
following weekend. Last weekend,
the Youth Center and San Jose
clashed with Cal and COP in a
quadrangular meet at Berkeley. Cal
won with a total of 75V2 points, SJS
was second with 40V2, and the
i Youth Center was close behind with
j 38.
Track enthusiasts will be able to
see some of the top track and iield
performers in the West compete in
the meet. Olympic pole vaulter
George Mattos of the Youth Cen
ter and formerly of San Jose State
has a 14-8 to his credit and won his
specialty at 14-4 last weekend.
Wyatt, another ex - Spartan,
should take another first in the
high jump for the Santa boys. In
the sprints, the Youth Center has
John George, winner of both
dashes in the 11)52 Big Meet for
! Cal, and George Roseme, also ex-
Cal. with a 213-foot best in the
javelin.
The Olympic Club has Sherm
Miller and Ted Rupprecht, both ex
j Oxy, in the 220 and either hundred
| or quarter, depending on their con
dition. Ex-Stanfordites Bud Held in
! the javelin and Otis Chandler in the
i shot should be easy favorites to
romp home first in their specialties.
San Jose State will be sparked by
j Lang Stanley, prep half-mile rec
! ord holder at 1:53.6. Stanley
j shocked the experts by topping
Cal's Ron Spurrier last weekend,
after being in bed all week with the
j flu.
j Stanford's Bob Simon will
probably go in the half and mile
while Bob Reed will handle two
mile chores. Bob Mathias will
romp over both hurdles, the dis
cus, and shot put. If all goes well v
he should take three firsts and a
third in the shot.
Stanford's tremendous trio of jav
elin throwers, Leo Long, Bob Kim
ball, and Chuck Harlow, may be
completely shut out by Held and Cy
Young of the Olympic Club and Ro
seme of the Youth Center.
