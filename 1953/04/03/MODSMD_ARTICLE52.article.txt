## Indians to Face Cal 
### JACK RANNELS 
Tomorrow afternoon at Berkeley
the Stanford Indian rugby team
will go into cdhibat with their Cali
fornia counterparts as underdogs
despite the fact that the Indians
won the last outing with the Bears j
earlier this year.
Coach Fete Kmetovic's forces J
have had a two-week layoff which
is hound to slow down their play
somewhat, despite the four work
outs which Kmetovic put the In
dians through during the past
week.
When last these two teams met i
the Bears were coasting along with j
an 11 to 0 lead when the Stanford j
scrum and backs Dorsey Atkinson
and Sam Morley started rolling.
Before the ponderous Bear knew
what had happened the Indians had
given them a 17 to 16 scalping.
Since then, the Indians made up j
for their sole defeat, a (5 to 3 lacing
by the UCLA ruggers, by skinning
the Bruin 18 to 0 in a game played
on the last day of finals. The Bears
in the meantime have beaten the
Uclans 22-9 and 115-6.
Uclan Coach Norm Padgett
classes the Cal hackfiehl of Don
Harris, A1 Talley, Kay Willsey,
and darting Mob Brooks and team
leader Max Howell as the best
Kughy hackfiehl he has seen in
the West since Pete Kmetovic,
Hugh Gallerneau, Norm Standlce,
and Frank Albert were playing
for Stanford.
Stanford's task lies in stopping
the Cal backs and in maintaining
control of the ball in the scrum. If
this can be done and if the Indian I
backs can come with clutch play:-; j
like Morley's running drop kick and !
Atkinson's penalty kicking, as well I
as running, the Stanfords have a
good chance for their first double
win over the Bears in many moons. !
The varsity game, to be played
I in Memorial Stadium, is scheduled
to start at 2:30 with the JV's meet
ing at the end of the varsity strug
gle. In a previous JV clash, the
Cards and Bears struggled to a 3-3
tie.
