### RUBY BERNSTEIN Staff Editor, The Daily 
Two years ago he said goodbye
to Stanford and academic life. To
day he's back on campus.
That man is Davud B. Jacobson,
the first resident of Stanford Vil
lage to be drafted for the Korean
campaign.
On Jan. 24, 1951, Jacobson board
ed a train at Menlo Park which
took him to Fort Ord and then to
Camp Roberts for his indoctrina
tion and basic training. But Jacob
son never left California.
When he was called into the
service, Jacobson was attending
Stanford as a graduate student of
creative writing, working toward an
M.A. and writing a book of short
stories under the supervision of
Wallace Stegner, head of Stanford's
Creative Writing Center.
While at the University Jacob
son also taught creative writing
at the Department of Adult Edu
cation in Palo Alto. Because of
this experience, he was trans
ferred, at the request of Lt. Col.
John F. Fitzgerald of the Medi
cal Corps, to Camp Roberts Hos
pital, where he served for two
months as supervisor of educa
tional activities for psychiatric
patients.
His next job in the Army was a
promotion to Chief Neuropsychiat
ry Technician for Camp Roberts,
and he headed the Neuropsychiatric
Section where he remained until his
separation from active-duty.
Jacobson, who returned to
Stanford March 17, enrolled for
spring quarter and is resuming
his studies and writing. He will
also return to his teaching duties,
with a class in Short Story Writ
ing beginning Wednesday at
p.m. at the Department of Adult

Education.
Jacobson, who is originally from
New York City, received his A.B.
from Queens College, Flushing,
N.Y., and at present lives at 1325
Parkinson Avenue.
