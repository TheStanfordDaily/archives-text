A certain Senior,
who shall be
* Nameless, was all
tangled up in an Unfortunate Situation. The
Bin Spring Weekend as just three days
away; his Number One Girl whs lined up;
the blueprint tailed for Substantial Re
sources—and he was, lo put it bluntly,
Busted, furthermore, his Credit Rating waj
Strictly Slow Music.
Namel ess. however, being a man of Consid
erable Ingenuity, even though Insolvent, was
nothing daunted. Hi- strategy was simple; a
quick rcronnoiler in Im hook of Family Sta
tistics, two minute* of inspired composition,
and a fast call to Western I nion.
The Big Weekend went like a Breeze. Our
Boy cut a Super-Swath and paid for it. Cold
Cash. Sunday night he oeorted his Dream
Girl down lo the 10:12. then headed for his
Cubicle, tired but lwppy- pausing only long
enough to throw i Heartfelt ki - toward thi
windows of the local Western linion offiee,
and to gaze fondly once again at a crumpled
telegram. It bore this wallet-warming mes
sage: '"Thank you for your Telegram and
for your sweet thought. Even an old lady
likes to have her birthday remembered. Hopo
the money order will prove useful." Signed
"Aunt Jane."
As we said, a man "112 t onsiderable Ingenuity,
One of the Nicest 1 hitiK* iboiil i 'I elegram
is tluit it does Mnrf lliin you Expel of it.
