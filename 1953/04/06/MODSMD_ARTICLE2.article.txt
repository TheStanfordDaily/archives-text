TOKYO, Monday, April 6 (UP) —United Nations and Communis!
negotiators held their first meeting today on exchange of sick and
wounded Korean war prisoners and agreed to continue the dis
cussions tomorrow.
There was cautious hope the new talks would lead to resump
tion of full scale armistice talks and an end to the Korean war.

Liaison officers of both sides met
at 10 a.m. (5 p.m. PST) over the
green baize conference table in the
Communist-built conference house
at Panmunjom.
After 35 minutes the Allied group
called u recess until 11 a.m., then j
met again and adjourned at 11:28!
a.m.
There was no immediate expla
nation for the break but observ
ers believed the Reds may have
conic up with some unexpected
proposal that the Allied team was
not prepared to receive without
consultation.
It. was the first major conference
at Panmunjom since Oct. 8, 1952,
and the first big chance for the
Reds to prove sincerity of their
"peace offensive."
The United Nations team, headed
by Rear Adm. John C. Daniel of
Bryn Mawr, Pa., flew to Panmun
jom by helicopter from the base
camp at Munsan.
Responsible quarters indicated,
before the talks opened, that the
Allies would insist on the imme
diate exchange of the sick and
wounded. Furthermore, they were
expected to leave no room for
Ited doubt that the exchange
would be taken as a demonstra
tion of good faith—or lack of it—
in the entire Communist program
for ending the war.
The Reds had coupled the pris
oner exchange with resumption of
the armistice talks in their prelimi
nary notes. Premier Chou En-lai of
Communist China, in bowing to the
Allied demand for voluntary repa
triation of war prisoners, had said
the renewal of negotiations could
lead to an armistice and finally to
a peace settlement.
The new regime of Premier
Gcorgi Malenkov in Moscow threw
its full support behind the Pciping
proposition, and offered to do what
ever it could to help work out a
settlement.
