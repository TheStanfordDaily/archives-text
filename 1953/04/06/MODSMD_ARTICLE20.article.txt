# Stanford—Today and Tomorrow
## 
### 
A bold and potentially noble experiment—
"Stanford—Today and Tomorrow"—exhales its
initial breath of life tonight with the first of
four sets of meetings between prominent ad
ministration members and students.
In these Monday night living group gather
ings, University officials, including President
Sterling, will attempt to acguaint students with
the background, functioning, and future plans
of three major phases of Stanford's operation:
Academics, Finances, and Buildings.
We say the experiment is bold because the
Administration has consented to go out and
talk matters over frankly with the students en
masse, speaking with them as equal compo
nents in a great endeavor fostering the spread
of knowledge.
For not only are the students one of the two
principal reasons of Stanford's existence to
day (the other being research), but also as alum
ni they will be the University's means of sup
port tomorrow.
Today they have a right to be acquainted
with the University's operation, and only if
they are included in the planning will they fur
nish enthusiastic support tomorrow.
We say the experiment is potentially noble
because if it succeeds, it will greatly strengthen
Stanford Family relations, thus strengthening
the basis upon which the University flourishes.
Thoughtful and wholehearted discussion will

be required for the program to succeed.
If the administration officials pull any
punches or if the students engage in rash or
witless questioning, the evils of ignorance, of
lack of mutual purpose will persist on the
campus.
The committee arranging the program has
suggested to the speakers a long list of ques
tions which students may ask to stimulate dis
cussion. We add a couple more:
What are the alternatives urfder considera
tion in planning the future of the Medical
School? What investigations are being made
into them? Has the Administration come to
any conclusions? If so, what?
How much awareness does the Administra
tion have of the conflict between emphasis
on gaining an academic reputation through re
search and emphasis on serving the student
with superior teaching? What efforts are being
made to resolve this conflict?
With these questions, others presented by
the program committee, and those students
may have on their mind, there exists ample
material for discusion.
By virtue of their positions, the administra
tion officials should be adequately equipped
with answers.
A successful reaction between the two will
bring real success to "Stanford—Today and
Tomorrow," both figuratively and literally.
