# Rules for Investigators
## 
### 
Within the past few years the role of the
investigating committee has balooned into a
major Congressional function. And that role
apparently will swell even further with 125
investigations currently under way or pending.
It is estimated that by the close of the 83rd Con
gress' term that more than $6,000,000 will have
been spent for probes into causes and items
ranging from Communists in colleges to the
prices of beef.
Though most of these investigations go un
noticed by the press, some continually hit and
flare in the headlines, particularly the activi
ties of Congress' three committees investi
gating Communism.
The three are the House Un-American Ac
tivities Committee, Harold Velde (R. 111.), Chair
man; Senate Internal Affairs Committee, Wil
liam E. Jenner (R. Ind.), Chairman; and the Sen
ate Subcommittee on Government Expendi
tures, bossed by Joe McCarthy (R. Wis.).
Stories involving the three have all been
dramatic; some have been tragic, particularly
the reports of unfair and abusive guestioning
by some committees, notably the one headed
by McCarthy.
But from San Jose last week caine a fresh
and clean report about the doings of one of
the committees, the House Un-American Ac
tivities group.
Dr. Richard B. Lewis, one of the most re
spected educators in California and director
of the audio-visual service center at San Jose

State, appeared before the group.
According to him its conduct is above re
proach. It is fair and considerate even of the
most difficult witness.
That leading questions are taboo, that a
witness has ample opportunity to confer with
his counsel, that a witness is free from the
pressures of third degree methods in at least
one committee is welcome word, welcome
word indeed.
But that these freedoms are preserved, even
in one committee, is a matter of some wonder,
for these freedoms do not find their basis in
any legal or even traditional guarantee but are
solely predicated on the individual beliefs and
conceptions of the committee chairmen, the
men who, almost without question, determine
the conduct of the committees.
If, as in the case of Velde, the chairman is
marked with a spirit of high conscientious
ness, then the witness is safe from undue pres
sure. But if the chairman is not governed by
such spirit, then the witness is unshielded and
alone. This makes for a dangerous lack of
sure-direction and positive protection for the
rights of v/itnesses.
Congress must take immediate steps to re
duce this shadowy ill-definition and institute
instead a comprehensive rule that governs the
duties of the committees and defines the par
ticular and unbreachable rights of the wit
nesses.

marked with a spirit of high conscientious
ness, then the witness is safe from undue pres
sure. But if the chairman is not governed by
such spirit, then the witness is unshielded and
alone. This makes for a dangerous lack of
sure-direction and positive protection for the
rights of v/itnesses.
Congress must take immediate steps to re
duce this shadowy ill-definition and institute
instead a comprehensive rule that governs the
duties of the committees and defines the par
ticular and unbreachable rights of the wit
nesses.

Within the past few years the role of the
investigating committee has balooned into a
major Congressional function. And that role
apparently will swell even further with 125
investigations currently under way or pending.
It is estimated that by the close of the 83rd Con
gress' term that more than $6,000,000 will have
been spent for probes into causes and items
ranging from Communists in colleges to the
prices of beef.
Though most of these investigations go un
noticed by the press, some continually hit and
flare in the headlines, particularly the activi
ties of Congress' three committees investi
gating Communism.
The three are the House Un-American Ac
tivities Committee, Harold Velde (R. 111.), Chair
man; Senate Internal Affairs Committee, Wil
liam E. Jenner (R. Ind.), Chairman; and the Sen
ate Subcommittee on Government Expendi
tures, bossed by Joe McCarthy (R. Wis.).
Stories involving the three have all been
dramatic; some have been tragic, particularly
the reports of unfair and abusive guestioning
by some committees, notably the one headed
by McCarthy.
But from San Jose last week caine a fresh
and clean report about the doings of one of
the committees, the House Un-American Ac
tivities group.
Dr. Richard B. Lewis, one of the most re
spected educators in California and director
of the audio-visual service center at San Jose

State, appeared before the group.
According to him its conduct is above re
proach. It is fair and considerate even of the
most difficult witness.
That leading questions are taboo, that a
witness has ample opportunity to confer with
his counsel, that a witness is free from the
pressures of third degree methods in at least
one committee is welcome word, welcome
word indeed.
But that these freedoms are preserved, even
in one committee, is a matter of some wonder,
for these freedoms do not find their basis in
any legal or even traditional guarantee but are
solely predicated on the individual beliefs and
conceptions of the committee chairmen, the
men who, almost without question, determine
the conduct of the committees.
If, as in the case of Velde, the chairman is
marked with a spirit of high conscientious
ness, then the witness is safe from undue pres
sure. But if the chairman is not governed by
such spirit, then the witness is unshielded and
alone. This makes for a dangerous lack of
sure-direction and positive protection for the
rights of v/itnesses.
Congress must take immediate steps to re
duce this shadowy ill-definition and institute
instead a comprehensive rule that governs the
duties of the committees and defines the par
ticular and unbreachable rights of the wit
nesses.
