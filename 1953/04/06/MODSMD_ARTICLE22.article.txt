### DICK MANSFIELD 
ON LIBRARY PAGES
There are those who say that library pages are
born and not made. The page is the little man who
carries your card away into the stacks at the Main
Library. If he returns, it is usually to tell you that
the book isn't in the library.
Sometimes they have to send another page into the

stacks after awhile to look for'
the first one. There must be nat
ural talent in there somewhere.
But pages ran be trained.
Two veteran pages were idling
in a corner of the stacks when a
new page went by, order slip in
hand.
"He doesn't look much like a
human being," said the first vet
eran.
"He don't even walk like a
linnm " cnirl tho cofnnfl

noom Dear, sain the second.
"Mayb** he's running."
"Funning? Naa!"
Half an hour later the new page passed again,
retui ning.
"Back so soon?" said the first veteran.
"Yep, said the youth, "Bui I didn't find the book."
"You're learning, kid!" said the second vet. "Did
you find a new place to sleep down there?

"Sleep in the bottom of the stacks? It's damp down
there!" said the youth with a shiver. He held up a
tome covered with moss.
"Thought you said you didn't find the book," said
the first veteran.
"I didn't!" said the neophyte proudly. "He wanted
a book on Syro-Phoenecian philosophy, and I'm
bringing him a French major's master's thesis. If
he doesn't take French, he'll be happy. Somebody
said the Syro-Phoenecinn philosophy is over at the
Civ libe. I'll say so on the card. . ."
"Don't do that!" said the second veteran. "Let him
find out for himself! Time he learned that here at
Stanford we have all sorts of different libraries."
"Exactly," said the first veteran.
"But there's some geology books down there in the
basement," said the youth. v Shouldn't they be over in
the geology library?"
"Yes." said the first veteran, rubbing his hands to
gether and chuckling.
The youth's eyes grew wide. "You mean . . .?" hp
said.
"Yaa," said the second veteran. "But run along,
kid. You'll get to Tactics later on . .

"Naa, he wasn't running," said the second veteran.
"More like sort of ambling."
"He'll learn," said the first veteran.

"Funning? Naa!"
Half an hour later the new page passed again,
retui ning.
"Back so soon?" said the first veteran.
"Yep, said the youth, "Bui I didn't find the book."
"You're learning, kid!" said the second vet. "Did
you find a new place to sleep down there?

"Sleep in the bottom of the stacks? It's damp down
there!" said the youth with a shiver. He held up a
tome covered with moss.
"Thought you said you didn't find the book," said
the first veteran.
"I didn't!" said the neophyte proudly. "He wanted
a book on Syro-Phoenecian philosophy, and I'm
bringing him a French major's master's thesis. If
he doesn't take French, he'll be happy. Somebody
said the Syro-Phoenecinn philosophy is over at the
Civ libe. I'll say so on the card. . ."
"Don't do that!" said the second veteran. "Let him
find out for himself! Time he learned that here at
Stanford we have all sorts of different libraries."
"Exactly," said the first veteran.
"But there's some geology books down there in the
basement," said the youth. v Shouldn't they be over in
the geology library?"
"Yes." said the first veteran, rubbing his hands to
gether and chuckling.
The youth's eyes grew wide. "You mean . . .?" hp
said.
"Yaa," said the second veteran. "But run along,
kid. You'll get to Tactics later on . .

"Naa, he wasn't running," said the second veteran.
"More like sort of ambling."
"He'll learn," said the first veteran.

ON LIBRARY PAGES
There are those who say that library pages are
born and not made. The page is the little man who
carries your card away into the stacks at the Main
Library. If he returns, it is usually to tell you that
the book isn't in the library.
Sometimes they have to send another page into the

stacks after awhile to look for'
the first one. There must be nat
ural talent in there somewhere.
But pages ran be trained.
Two veteran pages were idling
in a corner of the stacks when a
new page went by, order slip in
