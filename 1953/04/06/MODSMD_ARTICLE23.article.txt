# Ex-Red Lauds Investigations

### HADLEY ROFF 
Associate Editor, The Daily
What is it like to appear be
fore the House Un-American Ac
tivities Committee, the group
presently investigating alleged
Communist and other subver
sive influences in the nation's
colleges?
The Daily put. that question to Dr.
Richard B. Lev/is, confessedly a for
mer Communist, now director of the
audio-visual service center at San
Jose State, who recently appeared
before the committee as a "friendly"
witness.
Enthusiastically he said, "It was
wonderful. The committee is doing
everything it can td be completely
faiV to witnesses and the public. It
did everything to protect the legal
rights of every witness, whether
friendly or unfriendly."
Dr. Lewis, who received the
Doctor of Education degree from
Stanford in 1951 and who taught
here" one quarter in 1952, was
before the Committee to testify
about Communist participation in
a teachers' union during the 19,'105.
The stocky, fast-talking professor
makes no bones about his having
been a Communist. He was quick to
point out, however, that his involve
ment with the Reds was short-lived,
for "I dropped out after I learned the
true nature of the organization."

Since his break-off with tfae Com
munist party, Dr. Lewis has assisted
from time to time the Federal Bu
reau of Investigation and other in
vestigatory agencies in spotting pos
sible Communist influences.
During World War 11, he served
in the Navy as a lieutenant com
mander after a full loyalty check.
His appearance before the inves
tigating committee, he hopes, will
terminate hi.s service as an infor
mation source for the committee
and other agencies. "I have done
my bit and served my usefulness."
He recounted that during the
opening minutes of his part in the
committee hearings, which were
in Los Angeles, he was nervous.
"But as the hearing continued,
my nervousness faded and I be
came relaxed."
He emphasized that the manner
in which the committee men and
their counsel approached their task
was fair and considerate. There was
no pressure applied, nor were the
questions tricky or leading, the
State professor recalled.
Even with unfriendly witnesses,
and there were many, Dr. Lewis
said, thee ommittee members
"leaned over backward until they
were falling out of their seats" to be
fair. He asserted, however, that
Congressmen were driven to the
limits of their patience at times by
obstreperous witnesses and that
ugly and heated verbal exchanges
ensued. But that was the excep

tion and not the rule, Dr. Lewis j
| advised.
A iked what he thought the goal
of the committee to be. Dr. Lewis
replied that he sincerely believes
the committee to be searching for
the facts relevant to the subver
sive situation in colleges and is
"not just sniping at education."
Time and again during his inter- j
view with The Daily, the professor
.stressed his conviction that the
committee is trying to uncover
facts and not undermine the peo
ple's faith in education or the edu
j cated as has been charged.
In his mind, he said, the group |
seems to be probing lor specific in —
j formation—details, sure facts—and
| not general vague accusation. He
went on to say that much of today's
fear toward Communism is an ill
defined Sensation similar to the fear
one has going into a dark cellar at
night.
The committee, he asserted, is j
doing everything possible to pre
vent this dark - cellar - like fear
! from becoming an emotional, i
senseless apprehension. Dr. Lewis
reported thai the co m mitt e e
promised to send one of their in- j
vestigators to San Jose if he
found the public to be misin
formed or ill - informed on the
purpose of his appearance before
the committee.
Recalling the steps leading up to
his summons, Dr. Lewis said that
the investigator assigned to hi.s file
was most considerate, and during
his preliminary checks in the San
Jose region was careful to point out

to people contacted that Dr. Lewis j
was not under suspicion of being a j
Communist or a fellow traveler.
One particularly good thing about
the committee hearings, according
to Dr. Lewis, is the television which
beams its electric eye on the pro- '
ceedings provided a witness does j
not object. TV, he said, builds in
terest and allows thousands to see |
an important activity of their gov- j
ernment.

colleges?
The Daily put. that question to Dr.
Richard B. Lev/is, confessedly a for
mer Communist, now director of the
audio-visual service center at San
Jose State, who recently appeared
before the committee as a "friendly"
witness.
Enthusiastically he said, "It was
wonderful. The committee is doing
everything it can td be completely
faiV to witnesses and the public. It
did everything to protect the legal
rights of every witness, whether
friendly or unfriendly."
Dr. Lewis, who received the
Doctor of Education degree from
Stanford in 1951 and who taught
here" one quarter in 1952, was
before the Committee to testify
about Communist participation in
a teachers' union during the 19,'105.
The stocky, fast-talking professor
makes no bones about his having
been a Communist. He was quick to
point out, however, that his involve
ment with the Reds was short-lived,
for "I dropped out after I learned the
true nature of the organization."

Since his break-off with tfae Com
munist party, Dr. Lewis has assisted
from time to time the Federal Bu
reau of Investigation and other in
vestigatory agencies in spotting pos
sible Communist influences.
During World War 11, he served
in the Navy as a lieutenant com
mander after a full loyalty check.
His appearance before the inves
tigating committee, he hopes, will
terminate hi.s service as an infor
mation source for the committee
and other agencies. "I have done
my bit and served my usefulness."
He recounted that during the
opening minutes of his part in the
committee hearings, which were
in Los Angeles, he was nervous.
"But as the hearing continued,
my nervousness faded and I be
came relaxed."
He emphasized that the manner
in which the committee men and
their counsel approached their task
was fair and considerate. There was
no pressure applied, nor were the
questions tricky or leading, the
State professor recalled.
Even with unfriendly witnesses,
and there were many, Dr. Lewis
said, thee ommittee members
"leaned over backward until they
were falling out of their seats" to be
fair. He asserted, however, that
Congressmen were driven to the
limits of their patience at times by
obstreperous witnesses and that
ugly and heated verbal exchanges
ensued. But that was the excep

tion and not the rule, Dr. Lewis j
| advised.
A iked what he thought the goal
of the committee to be. Dr. Lewis
replied that he sincerely believes
the committee to be searching for
the facts relevant to the subver
sive situation in colleges and is
"not just sniping at education."
Time and again during his inter- j
view with The Daily, the professor
.stressed his conviction that the
committee is trying to uncover
facts and not undermine the peo
ple's faith in education or the edu
j cated as has been charged.
In his mind, he said, the group |
seems to be probing lor specific in —
j formation—details, sure facts—and
| not general vague accusation. He
went on to say that much of today's
fear toward Communism is an ill
defined Sensation similar to the fear
one has going into a dark cellar at
night.
The committee, he asserted, is j
doing everything possible to pre
vent this dark - cellar - like fear
! from becoming an emotional, i
senseless apprehension. Dr. Lewis
reported thai the co m mitt e e
promised to send one of their in- j
vestigators to San Jose if he
found the public to be misin
formed or ill - informed on the
purpose of his appearance before
the committee.
Recalling the steps leading up to
his summons, Dr. Lewis said that
the investigator assigned to hi.s file
was most considerate, and during
his preliminary checks in the San
Jose region was careful to point out

to people contacted that Dr. Lewis j
was not under suspicion of being a j
Communist or a fellow traveler.
One particularly good thing about
the committee hearings, according
to Dr. Lewis, is the television which
beams its electric eye on the pro- '
ceedings provided a witness does j
not object. TV, he said, builds in
terest and allows thousands to see |
an important activity of their gov- j
ernment.

before the committee as a "friendly"
witness.
Enthusiastically he said, "It was
wonderful. The committee is doing
everything it can td be completely
faiV to witnesses and the public. It
did everything to protect the legal
rights of every witness, whether
friendly or unfriendly."
Dr. Lewis, who received the
Doctor of Education degree from
Stanford in 1951 and who taught
here" one quarter in 1952, was
before the Committee to testify
about Communist participation in
a teachers' union during the 19,'105.
The stocky, fast-talking professor
makes no bones about his having
been a Communist. He was quick to
point out, however, that his involve
ment with the Reds was short-lived,
for "I dropped out after I learned the
true nature of the organization."

Since his break-off with tfae Com
munist party, Dr. Lewis has assisted
from time to time the Federal Bu
reau of Investigation and other in
vestigatory agencies in spotting pos
sible Communist influences.
During World War 11, he served
in the Navy as a lieutenant com
mander after a full loyalty check.
His appearance before the inves
tigating committee, he hopes, will
terminate hi.s service as an infor
mation source for the committee
and other agencies. "I have done
my bit and served my usefulness."
He recounted that during the
opening minutes of his part in the
committee hearings, which were
in Los Angeles, he was nervous.
"But as the hearing continued,
my nervousness faded and I be
came relaxed."
He emphasized that the manner
in which the committee men and
their counsel approached their task
was fair and considerate. There was
no pressure applied, nor were the
questions tricky or leading, the
State professor recalled.
Even with unfriendly witnesses,
and there were many, Dr. Lewis
said, thee ommittee members
"leaned over backward until they
were falling out of their seats" to be
fair. He asserted, however, that
Congressmen were driven to the
limits of their patience at times by
obstreperous witnesses and that
ugly and heated verbal exchanges
ensued. But that was the excep

tion and not the rule, Dr. Lewis j
| advised.
A iked what he thought the goal
of the committee to be. Dr. Lewis
replied that he sincerely believes
the committee to be searching for
the facts relevant to the subver
sive situation in colleges and is
"not just sniping at education."
Time and again during his inter- j
view with The Daily, the professor
.stressed his conviction that the
committee is trying to uncover
facts and not undermine the peo
ple's faith in education or the edu
j cated as has been charged.
In his mind, he said, the group |
seems to be probing lor specific in —
j formation—details, sure facts—and
| not general vague accusation. He
went on to say that much of today's
fear toward Communism is an ill
defined Sensation similar to the fear
one has going into a dark cellar at
night.
The committee, he asserted, is j
doing everything possible to pre
vent this dark - cellar - like fear
! from becoming an emotional, i
senseless apprehension. Dr. Lewis
reported thai the co m mitt e e
promised to send one of their in- j
vestigators to San Jose if he
found the public to be misin
formed or ill - informed on the
purpose of his appearance before
the committee.
Recalling the steps leading up to
his summons, Dr. Lewis said that
the investigator assigned to hi.s file
was most considerate, and during
his preliminary checks in the San
Jose region was careful to point out

to people contacted that Dr. Lewis j
was not under suspicion of being a j
Communist or a fellow traveler.
One particularly good thing about
the committee hearings, according
to Dr. Lewis, is the television which
beams its electric eye on the pro- '
ceedings provided a witness does j
not object. TV, he said, builds in
terest and allows thousands to see |
an important activity of their gov- j
ernment.
