# Minto's Theme 'Resurrection'
## 
### 
"As we gather on this day of tri
umph we should look behind the
familiar story and facts to the prin
ciple that underlies our victory,"
said the Rev. R. M. Minto, chaplain
of the University, speaking on "The
Resurrection Principle" in his Eas
ter sermon at Memorial Church
yesterday.
Chaplain Minto pointed out that
this resurrection principle is only
intelligible with the "close connec
tion between the faith ahead, real
ized in the resurrection of Christ,
and faith in that power at present
working in the resurrection prin
ciple."
He then said that "God gives us
the victory, but we are called
upon to live responsively because
we know our labor is not in vain,
and this power, as Paul said, shall
also quicken our bodies by the
power that is in us." According
to Chaplain Minto, this is the
power that we are living hy to
day.
He pointed out that the aim of
Christian faith is another world al
together, but this is a world that is
here now. Christians are not taken
out of this world, as to an "ivory
tower," but are left in this world
with its sorrow and death, trans
formed because they see the prin
ciple running through life that
nothing good is lost and that God
is victorious.
