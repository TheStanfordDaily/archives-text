Too much, • too often was the
Older of the clay and the 1953 edi
tion of Stanford track and field
opened the home season with an
impressive four-way win over the
Olympic Club, Santa Clara Youth
Center, and San Jose State Satur
day.
The Cards, deep in every event,
rolled up 73Vb points to 40 for the
Winged 1 '0," 29 for the Youth Cen
ter, and for the Spartans. The
Cards rolled up eight first places
in their romp, placed at least one
man in every event, and placed
more than one man in eight events.
Outstanding single performance
of the day by the Indians came
from crack distance ace Bob Si
mon, who pulled away from the
field in the last lap to finish in
4:115.5)—the fourth best mile ever
run by a Stanford man. Simon
did 4:12.8 at the end of last sea
son.
As usual, Bob Mathias copped 17
points for the Stanford ledger, tak
ing three firsts in the hurdles and
discus, and a third in the shot put.
The easy-gaited giant lopped off
the high sticks in an easy 14.5,
beating out teammate Gerry Wood,
a real comer, by half an inch in the
closest finish of the day. (Down
south, Jack Davis of SC! won his
high-hurdle event in 14.4 over the
weekend.)
Two other outstanding per
formances were by Herman Wy

George Mattos, also of the Youth

Center, who pole vaulted 14 ft.

The javelin saw the American
record holder, Bud Held of the
Olympic Club and ex of Stanford,
and Cy Young, the Olympic cham
pion, fight it out for first. Held won
by four feet with 224-ft 8 :! 4 in. Leo
Long, Stanford's best, threw for the
first time this season and took a
third at 210 ft. lIV 4 in.
The Stanford sprint team of
IVI au r y Pa r sons and Keith
Brownsberger traded first- and
second - place honors as Parsons
took the hundred at 10 flat and
Brownsberger took the furlon,** at
21.8. The favorite, John George
of Santa Clara, was left behind by
the pair of speedster.s
Elsewhere around the track
world, the very Golden Bears of
California romped over their little
brethren from UCLA, to 47V2,
posting good marks in the middle
distances and pole vault and show
ing depth in every event.
And to the South came omi
nous sounds of thundering feet
and strong muscles coming from
the Coliseum. Of note, the Tro
jans swept the furlong from Oxy
at 21.1, Incss took first in the
discus with 181 ft. 3'/k in. while
O'Brien took second with a mere

Older of the clay and the 1953 edi
tion of Stanford track and field
opened the home season with an
impressive four-way win over the
Olympic Club, Santa Clara Youth
Center, and San Jose State Satur
day.
The Cards, deep in every event,
rolled up 73Vb points to 40 for the
Winged 1 '0," 29 for the Youth Cen
ter, and for the Spartans. The
Cards rolled up eight first places
in their romp, placed at least one
man in every event, and placed
more than one man in eight events.
Outstanding single performance
of the day by the Indians came
from crack distance ace Bob Si
mon, who pulled away from the
field in the last lap to finish in
4:115.5)—the fourth best mile ever
run by a Stanford man. Simon
did 4:12.8 at the end of last sea
son.
As usual, Bob Mathias copped 17
points for the Stanford ledger, tak
ing three firsts in the hurdles and
discus, and a third in the shot put.
The easy-gaited giant lopped off
the high sticks in an easy 14.5,
beating out teammate Gerry Wood,
a real comer, by half an inch in the
closest finish of the day. (Down
south, Jack Davis of SC! won his
high-hurdle event in 14.4 over the

The Stanford sprint team of

second - place honors as Parsons
took the hundred at 10 flat and
Brownsberger took the furlon,** at
21.8. The favorite, John George

Elsewhere around the track

posting good marks in the middle
distances and pole vault and show

And to the South came omi
