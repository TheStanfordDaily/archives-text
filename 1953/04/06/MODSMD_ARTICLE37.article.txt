Stanford's ruggers were squashed
18-G by a rough Cal team Saturday
in the Berkeley Bowl. The loss
evened up the Card - Bear series
since Stanford won a 17-16 thriller
three weeks ago.
j Speedster Bob Brooks was the
thorn in the Card ;' : ide as he tal
lied two quick scores to get the
Bears off to a fa?t start;
Stanford's only score was tallied
by pint - sized Gene Katnik who
scored from two yards out. The
Cards' other three points were tal
lied by Dorsey Atkinson, whose ac
curate foot has accounted for most
lof the team's points this year. At
kinson hit a 135-yard penalty kick. t
Sam Morley, Marty Feldman, and
Ron Cook also starred.
