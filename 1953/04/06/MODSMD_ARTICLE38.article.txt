Making the most of only four hits,
the Stanford freshman baseballers
whitewashed El Cerrito Hitfh, 3-0,
on the frosh diamond Saturday be
hind the combined two-hit pitch
ing of Bob Grey and A 1 Dunn.
Grey, who received credit for the
Papoo es' third win of the 'season,
worked the first five frames, giving
up only a single to right. Dunn
fanned seven of the 1G batters he
faced in the final four innings.
Bob Evans' towering double to

blow in the Stanford attack. The
timely smash chased home Micky
Holzm m, who had singled, and Ray
Young* who had reached first on an
error, with the last two runs.
Pete Dahl dumped a single to
right with two out in the first to
score Holzman from second with
the initial Papoose tally.
