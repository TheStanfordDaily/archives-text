# Baseballers Edge Southern Cal, Split With Bruins; Shepard Goes on Spree
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Thundering Indian bats pounded
out wins number three and four in
CIBA play and then took the pause
that doesn't refresh in the nightcap
of Saturday's UCLA double-header
as the Bruins handed Stanford it's
first league loss, 1 to 0.
Southern Cal, which is at the bot
tom of the league, showed everyone
how it got there by committing six
errors to lose to Everett Dean's
boys, 6 to 5, on Friday.
In the first half of Saturday's
UCLA double hill. Stanford hats
men gave forth with their most
devastating performance of the
season to blast the Bruins out of
the park, 12 to 4. Unfortunately,
the gateman forgot to keep them
out and they crept hack for a
long enough duration to besmirch

the ( ards' record in the second
game.
Don DeLong, the whip - armed
southpaw, showed real promise as
he gained credit for the Southern
Cal victory. He was wild, giving up
eight walks, but he only allowed
three hits and no earned runs in a
six - inning tenure on the mound.
Mike Acker relieved in the seventh
and received credit for the victory.
The Indians broke a 4 to 4 tie
in the seventh by pushing across
two runs on no hits ... an error,
a sacrifice, a walk, interference on
the part of the catcher, and another
walk. Third baseman Ray Swarts
led the Stanfords at bat with two
for four.
Jack Shepard. Chuck Essegian,
and Hal Hennaey spearheaded the
Deanmen at the plate. Shf< trip
led and singled for four runs hat
ted in and poker-faced Essegian
muscled out three singles in live

trips for four KBl's. Herniary,
(he most-improved player on the
stjuad, blasted out two for four
in the first game, and two for
three in the second.
Bob Murphy, top dog on the
Card mound staif, received credit
for the triumph and only was in se
rious trouble in the third.
A 1 Talboy, who played the best
ball of his career this weekend, also
collected two hits, as did center
fielder Dick Cole, second sacker
Rich Scramaglia, and Swarts.
Phil Page choked olf the Bruins
with only one run and seven hits
in the second game, but silent In
dian hats betrayed him. UCLA
bunched three hits in the fifth in
ning to push across the winning
run.
The weekend melee left the In
dians on top of the heap with a
four and one record. UCIIA is sec
ond with three and two.
