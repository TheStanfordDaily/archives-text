# ASSU FOREIGN SCHOLAR
## 'Study in US Is Nice Time,’Says Eva 
### JANE LINDEMUTH 
Genevieve (Eva) Ginglinger,
ASSU Foreign Scholar, comes
from Mulhouse, a "town of three
countries," in France's Alsace-
Lorraine. Mulhouse is a town
situated twenty miles from the
borders of Switzerland and Ger
many. Eva's laughing grey
green eyes give her face the
charm of a French coquette while
the German and Swiss influen
ces may account for her love of
hard work and study—and for
her exuberant outlook on life.
Living at Durand House, Eva is
studying for a Stanford Master's
Degree in journalism.
For her thesis, Eva is working on
a content analysis of the Reader's
Digest as compared with similar
French magazines. Using a new
method in which she employs fifty
value symbols claimed to be uni
versal, Eva is scoring and tabulating
values expressed in each sentence of
six representative Digest magazines,
comparing American values with
those in French magazines.
Although the analysis is not com
plete, Eva believes that the Reader's
Digest emphasizes economic security,
independence of the individual, de
mocracy, generosity and kindness in
social relations. French magazines
place more emphasis on family life
and individual relations. The analy
sis is done mathematically with sym
bols such as IA for independence
achievement; ES, economic security;
S, political security; F, friendship.
American student-professor re
lations intrigue Eva. "It is amazing
to sec how informal, how kind arc
the professors. They invite us to
cAffec, and to dine in their homes.
We have informal discussions,
making of study a nice time. "
In France, Eva reports, the pres
tige of the professor keeps him high
above student levels in both social
and intellectual orbits of activity. In
France, study is not a social "nice
time." "It is purely an intellectual
experience—we have less practical,

fewer modern studies—more empha
sis on Latin and Greek. Economic
difficulties make the student more
mature, more inclined toward serious
intellectual work. There are fewer
clubs and less social life."
"Individualist" is the word that
would best describe the student of
France, Eva believes. In France it
is a privilege to study—not a "matter
of course." Examinations are much
more difficult — designed to cover
thx-ee years of study rather than three
months—thus testing the student's
ability to retain knowledge over a
period of time rather than his ability
to cram a quarter-year's work into
one night's study.
In high school, Eva studied Greek,
Latin, and music—concentrating on
the piano. During World War 11, Al
sace-Lorraine was claimed by Ger
many as being a German province.
"For five years we were forced to
forget our own language and to speak
only German—we had only German
schools and German teachers."
"One good point during that time
—the Germans allowed us to at
tend wonderful piano schools."
Having to choose between a mu

sical career and university (raining
was "the greatest decision of my
life." Enrolling in the Institute of
Political Science in Paris, Eva maj
ored in diplomatic history, study
ing Russian and Spanish, then add
ing an English course at the Sor
honne.
"America is so friendly," Eva
smiles. "All of the families accept us
immediately—they want to know
about France, and to hear about
Europe, its peoples, and its prob
lems."
"You cannot know how much I
have changed since I came to Ameri
ca," Eva smiled. "In France I was
reserved. Here I am so very social.
I ask people's names at once. It is so
easy, so frank, so simple. I like it
this way."
To Eva, San Francisco is a "combi
nation of the cosmopolitan and the
traditional." Best of all, she likes the
Thursday evening concerts, but Ls
amazed at the outlook of those who
attend. "In America yoi/ like con
certs, all concerts. The audience does
not differentiate does not develop
the critic technique. In France we
like to 'dissect' the program, the art
ist, and the interpretation—piece by
piece."
As for the Stanford campus—
"the Cellar is the nicest place.
Every day I am tempted to stay

there one hour or iiioic."
Fond of travel, Eva attempts to
visit a different country each yvar
—amontf them Spain, England, Ger
many. Her "most thrilling experi
ence" was an extended trip to
Greece, Turkey, and Italy where
she studied ancient civilizations "at
first hand."
Upon completion of her work at
Stanford, Eva plans a tour of Mexico
and the East. She especially looks
forward to a taste of the French in
fluence on America—as exemplified
by New Orleans. She hopes to con
tinue her studies in New York, del
ving into the subjects of communi
cation and opinion. Then? Back to
France with "always a love for this
America, where all people make of
everything—even of study and work
—a 'nice time'—a happy joke."
