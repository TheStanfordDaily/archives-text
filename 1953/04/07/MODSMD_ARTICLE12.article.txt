# Activities Lauded By Miss Strogen

### 
Miss Adcle Strogen, Assistant
Counselor for Women, gave the
Daily the following statement on
activities yesterday:
"In my opinion activities on a
university campus are an integral
part of the total- education of its
student body. In reality, they are
nothing more than a sound means
of meeting personal and community
needs. . . .
"It seems reasonable to me to as
sume that if all the potential of each
individual's efforts, thoughts, and
energies were directed toward bet
tering our Stanford community by
applying the'critical thinking that
is taught in a university curricu
lum, there could be no better guar
j ant.ee for future world and national
I citizenship."
