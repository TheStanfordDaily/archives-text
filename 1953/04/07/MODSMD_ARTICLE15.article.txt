### 
WASHINGTON, April 6 (UP) â€”
The administration today opposed a
suggested curb on the President's
treaty-making powers, but promised
to consult Congress on the handling
of major international agreements.
This stand was disclosed by Secre
tary of State John Foster Dulles.
Dulles told a senate judiciary sub
i committee that the proposed treaty
making curb might stifle conduct of
| foreign affairs at a critical time and
permit an opposition Congress to
"completely hamstring" presidential
handling of international issues.
He read the subcommittee a mes
sage from President Eisenhower
; promising that the administration
will consult with "appropriate con
gressional leaders and committees''
when a serious question comes up
on handling of international agree
ments.
