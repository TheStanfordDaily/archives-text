LAS VEGAS, Nev., April 6 (UP)
—One of the most powerful atomic
devices ever tested in the United
States exploded today almost a mile
above the Nevada desert, jolting
gambling tables in this resort 65
miles from the blast.
An Air Force B-50 bomber drop
ped the nuclear device which was
detonated at a record height more
than 5.000 feet above the Yucca
Flat atomic proving grounds at
about 7:30 a.m. (PST).
Seconds after the blast i— seen
more than 1.000 miles to the south
in Mexico, the first of two radio
controlled jet fighters flew through
the deadly radioactive cloud with
"crews" of mice and monkeys.
In addition to the B-50 which
dropped the device and jet drone
planes, the Air Force sent a forma
tion of its latest Strato-jets near the
mushroom cloud shortly after the
blast.
