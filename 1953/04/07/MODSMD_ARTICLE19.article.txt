# UN 						Accepts Red Plan For Prisoner Exchange
## Sick, Wounded to Be Traded Under Rules of Geneva Treaty 
### 
TOKYO, Tuesday, April 7 (UP)—The United Nations today ac
cepted a Communist proposal for exchange of all sick and wound
ed prisoners, including those less seriously disabled, on condition
that none be returned against his will.
Under the Communist plan introduced at yesterday's first meet-

ing on the proposed trade, seriously
sick and wounded men would be
returned to their own countries.
Those with minor disabilities which
might improve under neutral cus
tody would be transferred to a neu
tral nation.
Rear Adm. John C. Daniel, head
of the U.N. liaison officers' team,
told the Communists at the opening
of today's second session that the
U.N. accepted the offqr on one con
dition.
That was that rio prisoner be re
turned against his will. This has
been firm UN. policy since the start
of the truce talks.
Geneva Rules
The talks appeared to be moving
toward agreement on terms laid
down by the Geneva Convention.
Its Article 109, calling for ex
change of seriously sick and
wounded, also provides that no
prisoner may be delivered to hi:;
own side against his will while hos
tilities continue.
The following article, 110, deai ;
with less seriously disabled prison
ers who may be sent to temporary

neutral custody. Article 110 dors
not specifically provide that a pris
oner may reject repatriation.
Thus Daniel moved to make cer
tain there would be no misunder
standing on this point.
If the Communists agree to his
condition, it will be a major con
cession. Until their recent series of
peace moves, they were steadfast
in insisting that all prisoners be re
turned regardless of individual
wishes.
Maj. Gen. Lee San Cho, chief Red
delegate, particularly mentioned
Article 110 of the convention.
500 a Day
Daniel notified the Communists
that the Allies were ready to ex
change 500 sick and wounded pris
oners a day, starting within a week
after an agreement.
Lee said the Communists were
prepared to repatriate ali sick and
wounded prisoners. He added th 't
the exchange should include many
thousands not coming up to the*
rigid standards of "seriously si'.k
and wounded" under the Geneva
Convention.
"That is to say, our side i.s pre
pared to repatriate all the sick and
wounded prisoners of war entitled
to be directly repatriated or ac
commodated in a neutral country
according to the provisions in Ai -
] tides 100 and 110 of the Geneva
Convention," Lee said.
