Activities Day will malce its debut this after
noon when sixteen campus organizations set
up shop in Union Court for the trial run of
the Cardinals-sponsored and A Phi O - financed
project. We think it's a good project.
When Activities Day was scheduled, careful
consideration of a proper time was made. First,
Freshmen sponsors and administrators thought
that in the fall newcomers to the University
were too swamped with pre-reg activities and
Honor Code talks.
Hearing three minute activities talks which
gave little information was a punishment or a
bore and not of any important value. So last
fall the activities talks were cancelled and an
activities book took their place.
Still, many persons felt that the book was
not as satisfactory as having an opportunity
to talk personally to leaders of organizations.
So at the YWCA student workshop last quar
ter plans were set for Activities Day.
Whether or not the project is a success at
least two things will be discovered:
1. Are Stanford students interested in find
ing out about activities when the information
is made available to them?
2. Must the program itself be better publi
cized and packaged more attractively before

it is presented again next winter quarter?
For freshmen v/ho have been at Stanford for
two quarters Activities Day offers four hours
to meet officers of various campus clubs and
inquire into their operations.
But the freshmen are not the only students
who should be interested by Activities pay.
Sophomores and upperclassmen who transfer
red from other schools or upperclassmen v/ho
hesitated to join activities until they were set
academically might still be interested in extra
curricular activities. Student leaders believe
that there is enough campus talent to man every
activity twice over, if the right people are en
couraged to participate.
At Stanford students enjoy a unique privi
lege: we control and supervise our own clubs
and publications. We work with faculty mem
bers, not under their control, on everything
from politics to student health.
A good turnout thrs afternoon from people
who'have a sincere interest in activities will be
indicative of a desire to maintain this privilege.
Nobody will be twisting arms to join a particu
lar organzation. If you want, just come out and
mull around and enjoy a bull session or two.
The welcome mat is out—it's your task to
take the first steps. —Ruby Bernstein

were too swamped with pre-reg activities and
Honor Code talks.
Hearing three minute activities talks which
gave little information was a punishment or a
bore and not of any important value. So last
fall the activities talks were cancelled and an
activities book took their place.
Still, many persons felt that the book was
not as satisfactory as having an opportunity
to talk personally to leaders of organizations.
So at the YWCA student workshop last quar
ter plans were set for Activities Day.
Whether or not the project is a success at
least two things will be discovered:
1. Are Stanford students interested in find
ing out about activities when the information
is made available to them?
2. Must the program itself be better publi
cized and packaged more attractively before

it is presented again next winter quarter?
For freshmen v/ho have been at Stanford for
two quarters Activities Day offers four hours
to meet officers of various campus clubs and
inquire into their operations.
But the freshmen are not the only students
who should be interested by Activities pay.
Sophomores and upperclassmen who transfer
red from other schools or upperclassmen v/ho
hesitated to join activities until they were set
academically might still be interested in extra
curricular activities. Student leaders believe
that there is enough campus talent to man every
activity twice over, if the right people are en
couraged to participate.
At Stanford students enjoy a unique privi
lege: we control and supervise our own clubs
and publications. We work with faculty mem
bers, not under their control, on everything
from politics to student health.
A good turnout thrs afternoon from people
who'have a sincere interest in activities will be
indicative of a desire to maintain this privilege.
Nobody will be twisting arms to join a particu
lar organzation. If you want, just come out and
mull around and enjoy a bull session or two.
The welcome mat is out—it's your task to
take the first steps. —Ruby Bernstein
