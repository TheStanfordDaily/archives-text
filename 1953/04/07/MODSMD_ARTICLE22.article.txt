### PETE GROTHE 
TIIK OVERT AND TIIE COVERT
Ed. walking down Quad one morning, bumped into
Dr. F. Hanford Sherman, his poly sci professor last
quarter.
Ed: Well, hello. Dr. Sherman, how are you? (To
himself: I really don't care how the old geezer is,
but I can't think what else to say to him.)
Dr. Sherman: Just fine, Ed, thank you. (To himself:
Actually, I had the gout and arthritis over Spring va-

cation but I wouldn't give the
young whippersnapper the satis
faction of knowing it).
Ed: That's fine. Say, I really en
joyed your course last quarter.
(Actually, it was one of the most
miserable courses I ever had to
take. I had to fortify myself with
10 cups of Cellar coffee to stay
awake.)
Dr. Sherman: Well, I'm glad
you got something out of it. I

think that the type of material I gave is of paramount
importance to an understanding of present day po
litical affairs. (The scoundrel slept through all my
classes. I wouldn't doubt it if he thought that Taft
and Kefauver ran against each other in the last
election.)
Dr. Sherman: Say, incidentally, Ed, I'm sorry that
I-â€”er had to give you a failing grade in that
course. (Like hell, I'm sorry. If the head of the de
partment would have let me, I would have given him
an F- and doubled the number of units.)
Ed: Oh, that's .perfectly all right, ha, ha. As I
always say, grades are of little concern to me. It's
how much T get out of a course that counts. (Gad,
what a liar 1 am. He doesn't know that the guy who

let the air out of his tires and pulled all the pe
tunias out of his garden was me when I got my F.)
Dr. Sherman: That's a very good attitude, and
with a philosophy of life like that, you should be
a success. (He'll probably squander all his family's
money and end up in the alcoholic ward.)
Ed: Well, Dr. Sherman, it certainly has been nice
to talk to yoM outside of class, but I must be off. I
have to buy my books now so that I can do all my
assignments early. I'll come by your office sometime
to see you. Goodbye. (Like hell. I'll avoid him like
a plague. In fact, I hope he drops dead in his tracks.)
Dr. Sherman: Yes, this chat has been pleasant.
Goodbye, Ed. (Hmmm. He must be at least minus 11.
I'll have to tell my colleagues to flunk him out of
school this quarter.)

Joe St. Geme, senior class president, is worrying.
Ann Alabaster, senior vice president, is worrying.
Charlotte Mesick, senior secretary, is worrying. The
reason that they are worrying is that few seniors
have gone to the Bookstore to buy their senior an
nouncements and that the deadlineiiks k approaching
soon. The call is for seniors to relieve their class of
ficers' worrying and to get their announcements
quick.

Stanford will he trying for a national record in
the Idood drive next week, and there is no reason
why every aide student can't contribute.
One student has a bet with his professor that
Stanford will contribute at least 1,000 pints. The
prof will contribute a dime for every pint over
1.000 and the student has to pay a dime for every
pint under 1.000. If the goal of 5.000 pints is reached,
the prof will be out $400.
And so if you want to break a prof, contribute,
