## 
### DOROTHY DODGE Editorial Assistant, The Daily 
"The only reason they're alive
today is because of the blood
they received," Stanford's Rob
ert Phelps sayg of some of the
men he fought with in Korea.
Phelps, who has received the Dis
tinguished Flying Cross and the
Purple Heart among other award-,
left the Marine Corps last summer.
Besides doing graduate work in
civil engineering, he teaches three
CE classes in the Stanford Engi
neering Department.
The blond, good-looking ex-Ma
rine went to 'Korea in November,
iflSl -the winter of the war.
He spent four months as an infan
try platoon leader, then was rotated
to tactical air observer before he
himself was wounded.
The blood was needed, the blood
was received and used, Phelps
testifies. He recalls how the one
squadron he worked with used
helicopters to evacuate the
wounded from the front lines to
the hospitals.

A helicopter would move in and
pick up a wounded man. Then, with
whole blood kept in bottles in
brackets on the outside of the plane,
the crew would give him the trans

fusions he* needed (o keep him alive.
One of Phelps' Murine riflemen
was hit by an 82-moKar shell dur
ing the fighting on the east coast of
Korea. He eventually lost a leg and
at the time suffered severe shrapnel
wounds in his chest (this was be
fore they started using flak jackets,
Phelps explains).
"The blood was running out of
him like a siave," Phelph recalls.
"He wouldn't have lived if it hadn't
been for the transfusions they gave
him. I never expected him to live."
Ari evacuation helicopter picked
up the wounded man. He received
eight pints of blood before he got
to the hospital.
Phelps himself spent nine days
in a casualty .vard and there saw
blood bring • administered—2ft to
30 pints of whole blood during
the time he was there. Earlier he
saw the use of sernin albumin,
the blood material so useful for
shock treatment in the winter,
since it downs'! freeze.
Phelps is enthusiastic about Stan
ford's current 5,000-pint drive and
hopes to give blood himself if the
vifus disease he picked up in Korea
will allow.

"The only reason they're alive
today is because of the blood
they received," Stanford's Rob
ert Phelps sayg of some of the
men he fought with in Korea.
Phelps, who has received the Dis
tinguished Flying Cross and the
Purple Heart among other award-,
left the Marine Corps last summer.
Besides doing graduate work in
civil engineering, he teaches three
CE classes in the Stanford Engi

The blond, good-looking ex-Ma
rine went to 'Korea in November,
iflSl -the winter of the war.
He spent four months as an infan
try platoon leader, then was rotated
to tactical air observer before he
himself was wounded.
The blood was needed, the blood
was received and used, Phelps
testifies. He recalls how the one
squadron he worked with used
helicopters to evacuate the
wounded from the front lines to
the hospitals.

A helicopter would move in and
pick up a wounded man. Then, with
whole blood kept in bottles in
brackets on the outside of the plane,
the crew would give him the trans

fusions he* needed (o keep him alive.
One of Phelps' Murine riflemen
was hit by an 82-moKar shell dur
ing the fighting on the east coast of
Korea. He eventually lost a leg and
at the time suffered severe shrapnel
wounds in his chest (this was be
fore they started using flak jackets,
Phelps explains).
"The blood was running out of
him like a siave," Phelph recalls.
"He wouldn't have lived if it hadn't
been for the transfusions they gave
him. I never expected him to live."
Ari evacuation helicopter picked
up the wounded man. He received
eight pints of blood before he got
to the hospital.
Phelps himself spent nine days
in a casualty .vard and there saw
blood bring • administered—2ft to
30 pints of whole blood during
the time he was there. Earlier he
saw the use of sernin albumin,
the blood material so useful for
shock treatment in the winter,
