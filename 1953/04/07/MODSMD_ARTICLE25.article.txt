### PAT KING 
"Hello, Mary. My name is Su
i sie Smith and I'jn your sponsor.!
I'll show you where your room
is and introduce you to your
roommates."
Every September Mary and 400
freshmen like her are similarly
welcomed as they enter Roble or
Branner. In their sponsor they have
someone who will explain pre-reg
and. bonus slips, the ratio and the
lone w oman principal, class lists
J and BOE. Their sponsor is one who
can unlock a jammed trunk or sup
ply a blind date for the first reg
dance.
The AWS Sponsor Choosing
Committee will start receiving ap
plications for next year's sponsors
next week. Almost 40 junior and
senior sponsors are needed for the
freshman halls, off - campus and
summer-quarter women, and soph
omore and junior transfers.
i The purpose of the sponsor sys
tem is to help new students ad
; just to Stanford as quickly arid
! easily as possible. The program
emphasizes the importance of in
tangibles, of setting an example
of personal integrity, ftood citi
zens hip, and self - sufficiency
which will aid incoming students
in their personal development.
A good sponsor is not necessarily
an activities girl. The most impor
tant assets are an ability to get
along with and understand others
and a willingness to serve.
The sponsor program will he
discussed in the following resi
dences tomorrow night: Martha
( happell and Barbara Downs will
speak at Eucatypto; Carol Folsom
j and Allene Johns will talk to all
! Union Units and Ventura at Un
! ion Residence; and Betty Peirce
and Paula Hynes will speak to
' Upper Row women at Guthrie
House.
Since Stanford is a residence
campus, living groups are the cen
ter of sponsoring activities. The
sponsor is a member of the resi
dence staff within the dormitory
and works closely with the direc
tor and assistant director. As a stu
dent and staff member she Aas
triple responsibilities to her corri
dor, to student government, and to
the. University administration.
It's a big job, and to acquaint
the sponsors with their duties, a I

sponsor - training weekend was
begun. This year (he conference
will be held May 15-17 at the
Oakland YMCA camp in La llon
da. Sponsors will have a change
to become acquainted with each
other, with an over-all view of
campus and student activities, and
with the sponsor program from
the faculty and administration
viewpoints.
The weekend program will in
clude talks by residence heads,
faculty advisers, and administration
officials, plus numerous informal
discussions among the sponsors
themselves.
Junior or senior women who are
interested in next year's sponsor
program may fill out application
blanks in the ASSU office next
week and make appointments to be
interviewed.
The 13 - woman AWS Sponsor
Choosing Committee consists of the
