# PUNTS AND PITCHES

### Pete Grothe 
A spectacular bill oi fare will be served this Saturday for those who en
joy seeing men in technicolor underwear run in circles and jump over things.
This is the week that Jess Mortensen's Southern Cal tracksters come to
town, and not since the world was edging out of the depression in 1933 have
the Stanford cindermen stopped USC.
Stanford adherents have been saying, "Wait 'til next year" for 20 years.
We've interviewed four of the men closest to the Stanford track picture
and here is what they think:
Dink Templeton, former Stanford track coach who won scads of national
championships IoT the Indians and who is recognized as one of the top
five track experts in the country, is usually an optimist where Stanford is
concerned. But concerning Stanford's chances against the burly Trojans,
Dink turns Gloomy Gus. Says Dink, "I think we only have a slight chance
against the Trojans."
On the other hand, Coach Jack Weiershauser, never considered an opti-

mist, says, "In 1948 we scored (50 points against
Southern Cal (you need G6 to win). We hove
an even better chance this year than in 1948.
"Why do I make this prediction? Well. I
think we'll sweep the javelin and either the
SHtl or the two-mile, depending on where I
put Hob Simon. We have a good chance of
one-two in the 100 with Maury Parsons and
Keith Brownberger. and similarly the 220.
We should take one-two in the mile with
Simon and Bob Heed."
Weiershauser lists his second reason for con
fidence as being: "Jos teams usu
ally don't do well up north. Two years ago
they turned in an under par performance

against us, and last year they lolded against Cal. although they beat them."
Connie Jarvis, who knows a lot about an athlete's physical capabilities
in his position as trainer, says "My dope sheet has Stanford with 71 points
going into the relay, which Southern Cal will probably win."
Frosh Coach Ray Dean, however, thinks that the relay will decide the
meet.
II we may be permitted to interject an opinion, we think that the meet
outcome will in good measure rest on the capable shoulders of Bob Ma-
Ihias. Bob, however, is faced with a herculean problem. In the events
that Bob specializes in . . . the discus, shot, and hurdles, FSC brings to
town two Olympic champions and one Olympic second-placer. This, we
submit, is somewhat impressive competition.
Sim Iness won the Olympic discus. Parry O'Brien the shot put, and Jack
Davis was second in the hurdles by a whisker. Mathias's unequaled
"come-through" talents will be tested to the hilt. In .addition, Bob will
also enter the high jump to try to prevent a USC sweep in that event.
As they say in the Class B movies, "This is it. - '
* * *
Contrary to rumors, Stanford won't abandon track when Bob Mathias
graduates. As a matter of fact, this year's frosh track team may be Stan
lord's all-time best, and Coach Ray Dean is not the last to admit this.
In last week's meet, the frosh topped four of the varsity's winning marks
and tied one of them. â€¢
Footballer John Stewart has high-jumped six-live in practice and
Weiershauser could use him very well, thank you, in this Saturday's
meet.
Jim Truher could make a great decathloner. He copped the 100 and
220 on one hand and won the shot put and placed second in the discus in
last Saturday's meet. Truher, who did the 100 in 9.7 in high school,
muscled the shot 45 feet, one-and-one-half inches in the last meet. This
is especially good when one considers that Truher hardly ever works out
for the shot. The coaches think that Truher will be able to get the shot well
over 50 feet if he ever decides to work on it.
One of the top prospects is clean-limbed Jim Lutrell. who was one of
the top high school hurdlers in the nation last year and should be one of
the best college hurdlers in the nation in a few years. O'nly a few steps
behind him is Bill Rupp.
Ralph Love, who ran a 4:24.8 mile last week will be a great addition
to the varsity as well as pole vaulter John Whalen.
The future looks good.
