Stanford has long been known
athletically as one of the most pro
gressive schools in America. It was
here that Hank Luisetti first at
tempted the one - hand basketball
shot. This University was the first
in America to own its own football
stadium. And it was in that stadium
that Clark Shaughnessy first used a
new offensive lineup that later
came to be known as the "T."
This Saturday history may
again lie made here. For Coach
Jim Fifer's crew is going to meet
USC in an event never before at
tempted—a crew relay race.
The Indian varsity, JV, and
freshman crew teams will meet the
similar teams of the Trojans. The
two varsity crews will start and
race 1,000 meters, where the JV
teams will take over and return to
the original spot. There the frosh
team will go back to where the var
sity is waiting, etc.
All in all, the varsity will race
five times, with the other teams
competing four times each. Though
the affair sounds like a marathon
event, it actually is expected to last
only 52 minutes.
Fifer, a student here, originated
the idea, and USC agreed to test
the event against Stanford. Un
like the normal crew race, this is
definitely an attempt at making
crew more of a spectator sport.
In the first place, fans watching
the start of the race do not have to
jump in their cars and race across
the country in order to see the fin
ish. The 13,000 - meter race only
covers 1,000 of the meters.
Another advantage of this race is
that one of the most interesting
things to the fans will be watching

the teams at work while not racing.
If there is a broken oar, or a lea):
in the shell, the team will pitch in
furiously to repair the damage. The
end of each individual race should
be more exciting also, for the crews
will not be as exhausted as" they
normally are, and will put on a
good race for the finish line. The
moment a shell crosses a designated
line, the next shell may start.
Dink Templeton is scheduled to
be one of the referees, and that
should assure everyone that the
race will start on time. For short
ly after the race ends the USC-
Stanford track meet will begin,
and the former Indian coach
would as soon walk out on the
race as miss even the first cinder
event.
And speaking of track, the time
has come, as it must for all teams
on the USC track schedule, for the
Indians to receive their annual
trouncing from the mighty Trojans.
The pattern of many sports writ
ers and colunmists is the same year
after year: at first they say the Tro
jans cannot be defeated; then, as
USC slips a little and wins a meet
by only 50 points, they claim, "Well,

, Stanford has a slim chance IF —
finally, as the Big Red Machine runs
out of gas for the umteenth con
secutive time against the Southern
Caiifornians, the cry changes—not
i to how good a team USC has, but to
! the fact that the Trojans give out
thousands of scholarships to track
athletes while the Innocent Inc'ians
i studiously follow the straight and
! narrow.
Several coaches, trainers, etc.,
have been asked by Pete Grothe
| how they think the meet will end.
Naturally, none of them are going
to say that we haven't a chance,
1 even if this were the case. The only
I people who give us any serious
I chance at all compare our best
i times and distances against the Tro
j jans' average marks, while in fact
j USC has almost always been at its
best against us.
Let's face the facts: (1) USC is
known not only throughout the
nation but over the world for its
track prowess; it's a privilege and
an honor for an athlete to even
make the team; (2) many of the
scholarships they give are purely
offered in self - defense against
schools like. Occidental and Cal.
Nothing the Trojan track teai>
needs is lacking — the finest in
i equipment, coaching, and pub
licity.
Take, for example, Bob Mathias.
! He attended the same high school as
| Sim Iness, and all during that pe
riod Mathias consistently defeated
his classmate. Mathias came to
Stanford, and, while participating
in practically every event possible,
has not become really outstanding
in any one. Had he gone to USC
and concentrated on just the discus,
and if he had stayed ahead of Iness
at the same rate he did in high
school, he would today hold the
world's record for the discus! And,
were it not for Mathias' fame as a
decathlon star, he would have died
the death of Gay Bryan—a great
athlete who had to enter so many
events he was never the world's
best in any one, and was soon for
gotten by fans (there are many
students in today's freshman class
who have never heard of Bryan).
If all this is true, it might be
asked how Stanford gets the
number of athletes it does. Again,
the answer is obvious: Stanford
appeals to athletes who want

more from a college than an ath
letic machine. If Mathias had
wanted nothing from college hut
track, chances are he would have
gone to some other school.
Thus, the scholarships USC gives
are not to lure athletes to that
school; lower grade requirements
and an international track reputa
tion do that for them. The Trojans
were a track power long before
modern proselyting methods were
even dreamed of. Instead, they do
it only to protect themselves against
other schools luring away Southern
California athletes.
We hope this will clarify the j
complaints that will soon be arising
about USC stealing potential Stan
ford athletes. Instead, the fact is
that the Trojans and Stanford offer
different things to athletes, and if
a student is going to school only for
athletics, then we don't want him!

Boh Mathias reported yesterday
that he injured his left leg while
competing in the low hurdles
Saturday. The extent of the in
jury was not determined.

All in all, the varsity will race
five times, with the other teams
competing four times each. Though
the affair sounds like a marathon
event, it actually is expected to last
only 52 minutes.
Fifer, a student here, originated
the idea, and USC agreed to test
the event against Stanford. Un
like the normal crew race, this is
definitely an attempt at making
crew more of a spectator sport.
In the first place, fans watching
the start of the race do not have to
jump in their cars and race across
the country in order to see the fin
ish. The 13,000 - meter race only
covers 1,000 of the meters.
Another advantage of this race is
that one of the most interesting
things to the fans will be watching

the teams at work while not racing.
If there is a broken oar, or a lea):
in the shell, the team will pitch in
furiously to repair the damage. The
end of each individual race should
be more exciting also, for the crews
will not be as exhausted as" they
normally are, and will put on a
good race for the finish line. The
moment a shell crosses a designated
line, the next shell may start.
Dink Templeton is scheduled to
be one of the referees, and that
should assure everyone that the
race will start on time. For short
ly after the race ends the USC-
Stanford track meet will begin,
and the former Indian coach
would as soon walk out on the
race as miss even the first cinder
event.
And speaking of track, the time
has come, as it must for all teams
on the USC track schedule, for the
Indians to receive their annual
trouncing from the mighty Trojans.
The pattern of many sports writ
ers and colunmists is the same year
after year: at first they say the Tro
jans cannot be defeated; then, as
USC slips a little and wins a meet
by only 50 points, they claim, "Well,

, Stanford has a slim chance IF —
finally, as the Big Red Machine runs
out of gas for the umteenth con
secutive time against the Southern
Caiifornians, the cry changes—not
i to how good a team USC has, but to
! the fact that the Trojans give out
thousands of scholarships to track
athletes while the Innocent Inc'ians
i studiously follow the straight and

Several coaches, trainers, etc.,
have been asked by Pete Grothe
| how they think the meet will end.
Naturally, none of them are going
to say that we haven't a chance,
1 even if this were the case. The only
I people who give us any serious
I chance at all compare our best
i times and distances against the Tro
j jans' average marks, while in fact
j USC has almost always been at its
best against us.
Let's face the facts: (1) USC is
known not only throughout the
nation but over the world for its
track prowess; it's a privilege and
an honor for an athlete to even
make the team; (2) many of the
scholarships they give are purely
offered in self - defense against
schools like. Occidental and Cal.
Nothing the Trojan track teai>
needs is lacking — the finest in
i equipment, coaching, and pub
licity.
Take, for example, Bob Mathias.
! He attended the same high school as
| Sim Iness, and all during that pe
riod Mathias consistently defeated
his classmate. Mathias came to
Stanford, and, while participating
in practically every event possible,
has not become really outstanding
in any one. Had he gone to USC
and concentrated on just the discus,
and if he had stayed ahead of Iness
at the same rate he did in high
school, he would today hold the
world's record for the discus! And,
were it not for Mathias' fame as a
decathlon star, he would have died
the death of Gay Bryan—a great
athlete who had to enter so many
events he was never the world's
best in any one, and was soon for
gotten by fans (there are many
students in today's freshman class
who have never heard of Bryan).
If all this is true, it might be
asked how Stanford gets the
number of athletes it does. Again,
the answer is obvious: Stanford
appeals to athletes who want

more from a college than an ath
letic machine. If Mathias had
wanted nothing from college hut
track, chances are he would have
gone to some other school.
Thus, the scholarships USC gives
are not to lure athletes to that
school; lower grade requirements
and an international track reputa
tion do that for them. The Trojans
were a track power long before
modern proselyting methods were
even dreamed of. Instead, they do
it only to protect themselves against
other schools luring away Southern
California athletes.
We hope this will clarify the j
complaints that will soon be arising
about USC stealing potential Stan
ford athletes. Instead, the fact is
that the Trojans and Stanford offer
different things to athletes, and if
a student is going to school only for
athletics, then we don't want him!

be more exciting also, for the crews
will not be as exhausted as" they
normally are, and will put on a
good race for the finish line. The
moment a shell crosses a designated
line, the next shell may start.
Dink Templeton is scheduled to
be one of the referees, and that
should assure everyone that the
race will start on time. For short
ly after the race ends the USC-
Stanford track meet will begin,
and the former Indian coach
would as soon walk out on the
race as miss even the first cinder
event.
And speaking of track, the time
has come, as it must for all teams
on the USC track schedule, for the
Indians to receive their annual
trouncing from the mighty Trojans.
The pattern of many sports writ
ers and colunmists is the same year
after year: at first they say the Tro
jans cannot be defeated; then, as
USC slips a little and wins a meet
by only 50 points, they claim, "Well,

, Stanford has a slim chance IF —
finally, as the Big Red Machine runs
out of gas for the umteenth con
secutive time against the Southern
Caiifornians, the cry changes—not
i to how good a team USC has, but to
! the fact that the Trojans give out
thousands of scholarships to track
athletes while the Innocent Inc'ians
i studiously follow the straight and

Several coaches, trainers, etc.,
have been asked by Pete Grothe

Naturally, none of them are going
to say that we haven't a chance,
1 even if this were the case. The only
I people who give us any serious
I chance at all compare our best
i times and distances against the Tro
j jans' average marks, while in fact
j USC has almost always been at its
best against us.
Let's face the facts: (1) USC is
known not only throughout the
nation but over the world for its
track prowess; it's a privilege and
an honor for an athlete to even
make the team; (2) many of the
scholarships they give are purely
offered in self - defense against
schools like. Occidental and Cal.
Nothing the Trojan track teai>
needs is lacking — the finest in
i equipment, coaching, and pub
licity.
Take, for example, Bob Mathias.
! He attended the same high school as
| Sim Iness, and all during that pe
riod Mathias consistently defeated
his classmate. Mathias came to
Stanford, and, while participating
in practically every event possible,
has not become really outstanding
in any one. Had he gone to USC
and concentrated on just the discus,
and if he had stayed ahead of Iness
at the same rate he did in high
school, he would today hold the
world's record for the discus! And,
were it not for Mathias' fame as a
decathlon star, he would have died
the death of Gay Bryan—a great
athlete who had to enter so many
events he was never the world's
best in any one, and was soon for
gotten by fans (there are many
students in today's freshman class
who have never heard of Bryan).
If all this is true, it might be
asked how Stanford gets the
number of athletes it does. Again,
the answer is obvious: Stanford
appeals to athletes who want

more from a college than an ath
letic machine. If Mathias had
wanted nothing from college hut
track, chances are he would have
gone to some other school.
Thus, the scholarships USC gives
are not to lure athletes to that
school; lower grade requirements
and an international track reputa
tion do that for them. The Trojans
were a track power long before
modern proselyting methods were
even dreamed of. Instead, they do
it only to protect themselves against
other schools luring away Southern
California athletes.
We hope this will clarify the j
complaints that will soon be arising
about USC stealing potential Stan
ford athletes. Instead, the fact is
that the Trojans and Stanford offer
different things to athletes, and if
a student is going to school only for
athletics, then we don't want him!

Boh Mathias reported yesterday
that he injured his left leg while
competing in the low hurdles
Saturday. The extent of the in
jury was not determined.


JIM FIFER
—A new idea
Stanford has long been known
athletically as one of the most pro
gressive schools in America. It was
here that Hank Luisetti first at
tempted the one - hand basketball
shot. This University was the first
in America to own its own football
stadium. And it was in that stadium
that Clark Shaughnessy first used a
new offensive lineup that later
came to be known as the "T."
This Saturday history may
again lie made here. For Coach
Jim Fifer's crew is going to meet
USC in an event never before at
tempted—a crew relay race.
The Indian varsity, JV, and
freshman crew teams will meet the
similar teams of the Trojans. The
two varsity crews will start and
race 1,000 meters, where the JV
teams will take over and return to
the original spot. There the frosh
team will go back to where the var
sity is waiting, etc.
All in all, the varsity will race
five times, with the other teams
competing four times each. Though
the affair sounds like a marathon
event, it actually is expected to last
only 52 minutes.
Fifer, a student here, originated
the idea, and USC agreed to test
the event against Stanford. Un
like the normal crew race, this is
definitely an attempt at making
crew more of a spectator sport.
In the first place, fans watching
the start of the race do not have to
jump in their cars and race across
the country in order to see the fin
ish. The 13,000 - meter race only
covers 1,000 of the meters.
Another advantage of this race is
that one of the most interesting
things to the fans will be watching

the teams at work while not racing.
If there is a broken oar, or a lea):
