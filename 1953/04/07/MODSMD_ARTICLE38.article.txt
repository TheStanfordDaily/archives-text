# French Photog on Campus
## 
### MARY FRAZER Daily Feature Editor 
Edouard Boubat, roving pho
tographic correspondent for the
Paris magazine "Realite," is vis
iting the Stanford campus as part
of a five months' reporting as
signment in the United States.
Boubat plans an exhibition of his
work at the Museum of Modern
Art, New York, later in the spring.
His photographic essays are being
presented in a series on "American
Life" in the Paris .magazine as well.

According to Boubat, "Realite" is
a combination of the "Fortune" and
"Holiday" type of publication.
"My assignment," says the young
Frenchman, "is to photograph all
aspects life—to capture
the human side. A picture of peo
ple's feet, for example, may not be
an extraordinarily eloquent presen
tation of American humanity," he
says smiling, "but it's true."
Boubat began his American tout
in the Southern states, and spent
considerable time, in Natchez, Miss.,
to capture this "human side" of
Southern racial problems.
Liberty, Texas, impressed him
greatly—"ln every garage . . . live
automobiles!"
Easterners and Southerners arc
not as open and friendly as Cali
fornians, Boubat linds. ''Every
body here is so relaxed. It must
be the climate," he says.
Boubat is attempting to record

this aspect of California living, plus
the great business and industrial
expansion which he sees taking
place.
An art student in Paris before be
coming a professional journalist,
Boubat has been a photographic
correspondent in almost every
country in the world, "and most of
them twice," he says.
He hopes that his work in pre
senting the actual United States
will counteract, to some degree,
the prevailing French opinion of
Americans, the product of Holly
wood movies in France.
Boubat has a government grant
under the Educational Exchange
program. In return, an American
student is doing similar work in
France under government auspices
for five months.
Boubat will go to Salt Lake City
after leaving California next week.
