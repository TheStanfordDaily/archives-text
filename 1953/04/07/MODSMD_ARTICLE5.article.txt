# STANFORD—TODAY AND TOMORROW
## Sterling Tackles UG, Research Problem 
### Barbara Tuerk 
(Ivcl. note: The following story is the first of a scries during Ihr current
"Stanford—Today and Tomorrow" program in which The Daily will
covcr one speaker each week).

"Today Stanford is rated as one of the top four to ten under
graduate schools in the nation," University President Dr. Wallace
Sterling told students from Delta Tau Delta and Jordan House last
night at the Delt house.
"But unless we do more to hold to our laurels, we may lose

that rating," the president warned
in the first of his "Stanford—Today
and Tomorrow" talks.
Our curriculum, lecture system,
and fund-raising are among the areas
in which Dr. Sterling believes we ■
need real improvement.
"Real education comes from going
more deeply into one subject than
we can here with our great rainbow
of courses and all our electives," he
said, after suggesting that we might
offer fewer courses, but ones which
carried through two or three quar
ters.
Dr. Sterling condemned our
lecture system for its inadequa
cies. "Your memorable lectures
are usually the big ones," he ad
mitted. "But much of your real
education comes from smaller—
and very costly—tutorial groups.
It is my hope some day we will
be able to complement our lec
ture system with sections, like
we have now in the Western Civ
ilization courses."
Stanford's original position as one
of the most richly endowed schools
in the nation has slipped drastically,
the president admitted, because
"Stanford has never put its shoulder
"It's easier, too," he went on, "to
Dr. Sterling concluded, "There's
nothing wrong with Stanford that
$100,000,000 wouldn't cure."
Students threw question after
question at the president, as he sat
with them until long after the meet
ing was scheduled to end. The first
question was the controversial: Is
research or teaching ability more
important in judging a px'ofessor?
"Both," the president answered.
"The two are inseparable. The man
we seek is at least a good teacher,
hopefully an excellent one, and al-so
a fine scholar."
"It's difficult for us to appraise a
faculty member," he admitted. "But
it's much more difficult for a stu
dent. Any young man of 28 or 29,
with a Ph.D. and some native in
telligence, if he's articulate and has
a flair for presentation, can put
himself across and convince a class
that he's really good. But it's a lot
harder for him to convince the col
leagues who know as much as he
docs about his subject."
The criterion for people who

really know the subject has to
be research, I)r. Sterling said.
And, he added, the national repu
tation of a school depends upon
how well its faculty can hold up
their own with their colleagues.
"It's easier, oo," he went on, "tto
know who's a good teacher now in
April, 1953, than to say who will
still be good in April, 1973. There's
the problem of what we in our of
fice call early bloomers and later
bloomers. One young man comes
in—the prize rookie of the year.
But we have to take him under
tenure for the next 45 years. And
we have the other problem of the
young man we dismiss now who
wins the Nobel Prize 15 years
later."
A second question that popped up
quickly was: Will the University
place more emphasis in the future
on the graduate or on the under
graduate level?
Dr. Sterling answered that there
will be increased emphasis on our
lower divisions. According to re
cent recommendations, Berkeley and
Westwood will be increasingly up
per division and graduate schools,
and Stanford will have greater op
portunities than ever to be the
outstanding four-year undergradu
ate school on the Coast.
As a university, he added, our
rating is less high than as an
undergraduate school. It's not be
cause our graduate schools arc
not tops, but because they lack
range.
"In those areas in which we do
compete, we compete most success
fully," the president said. Our
graduate schools of Physics, Min
eral Science, Engineering, Mcdi
cinc, Law, and Business, arc among
the tops in their fields, but in many
fields we have no departments at
all."

and Tomorrow" talks.
Our curriculum, lecture system,
and fund-raising are among the areas
in which Dr. Sterling believes we ■
need real improvement.
"Real education comes from going
more deeply into one subject than
we can here with our great rainbow
of courses and all our electives," he
said, after suggesting that we might
offer fewer courses, but ones which
carried through two or three quar
ters.
Dr. Sterling condemned our
lecture system for its inadequa
cies. "Your memorable lectures
are usually the big ones," he ad
mitted. "But much of your real
education comes from smaller—
and very costly—tutorial groups.
It is my hope some day we will
be able to complement our lec
ture system with sections, like
we have now in the Western Civ
ilization courses."
Stanford's original position as one
of the most richly endowed schools
in the nation has slipped drastically,
the president admitted, because
"Stanford has never put its shoulder
"It's easier, too," he went on, "to
Dr. Sterling concluded, "There's
nothing wrong with Stanford that
$100,000,000 wouldn't cure."
Students threw question after
question at the president, as he sat
with them until long after the meet
ing was scheduled to end. The first
question was the controversial: Is
research or teaching ability more
important in judging a px'ofessor?
"Both," the president answered.
"The two are inseparable. The man
we seek is at least a good teacher,
hopefully an excellent one, and al-so
a fine scholar."
"It's difficult for us to appraise a
faculty member," he admitted. "But
it's much more difficult for a stu
dent. Any young man of 28 or 29,
with a Ph.D. and some native in
telligence, if he's articulate and has
a flair for presentation, can put
himself across and convince a class
that he's really good. But it's a lot
harder for him to convince the col
leagues who know as much as he
docs about his subject."
The criterion for people who

really know the subject has to
be research, I)r. Sterling said.
And, he added, the national repu
tation of a school depends upon
how well its faculty can hold up
their own with their colleagues.
"It's easier, oo," he went on, "tto
know who's a good teacher now in
April, 1953, than to say who will
still be good in April, 1973. There's
the problem of what we in our of
fice call early bloomers and later
bloomers. One young man comes
in—the prize rookie of the year.
But we have to take him under
tenure for the next 45 years. And
we have the other problem of the
young man we dismiss now who
wins the Nobel Prize 15 years
later."
A second question that popped up
quickly was: Will the University
place more emphasis in the future
on the graduate or on the under
graduate level?
Dr. Sterling answered that there
will be increased emphasis on our
lower divisions. According to re
cent recommendations, Berkeley and
Westwood will be increasingly up
per division and graduate schools,
and Stanford will have greater op
portunities than ever to be the
outstanding four-year undergradu
ate school on the Coast.
As a university, he added, our
rating is less high than as an
undergraduate school. It's not be
cause our graduate schools arc
not tops, but because they lack
range.
"In those areas in which we do
compete, we compete most success
fully," the president said. Our
graduate schools of Physics, Min
eral Science, Engineering, Mcdi
cinc, Law, and Business, arc among
the tops in their fields, but in many
fields we have no departments at
all."

mitted. "But much of your real
education comes from smaller—
and very costly—tutorial groups.
It is my hope some day we will
be able to complement our lec
ture system with sections, like
we have now in the Western Civ
ilization courses."
Stanford's original position as one
of the most richly endowed schools
in the nation has slipped drastically,
the president admitted, because
"Stanford has never put its shoulder

Dr. Sterling concluded, "There's
nothing wrong with Stanford that
$100,000,000 wouldn't cure."
Students threw question after
question at the president, as he sat
with them until long after the meet
ing was scheduled to end. The first
question was the controversial: Is
research or teaching ability more
important in judging a px'ofessor?
"Both," the president answered.
"The two are inseparable. The man
we seek is at least a good teacher,
hopefully an excellent one, and al-so
a fine scholar."
"It's difficult for us to appraise a
faculty member," he admitted. "But
it's much more difficult for a stu
dent. Any young man of 28 or 29,
with a Ph.D. and some native in
telligence, if he's articulate and has
a flair for presentation, can put
himself across and convince a class
that he's really good. But it's a lot
harder for him to convince the col
leagues who know as much as he
docs about his subject."
The criterion for people who

really know the subject has to
be research, I)r. Sterling said.
And, he added, the national repu
tation of a school depends upon
how well its faculty can hold up
their own with their colleagues.
"It's easier, oo," he went on, "tto
know who's a good teacher now in
April, 1953, than to say who will
still be good in April, 1973. There's
the problem of what we in our of
fice call early bloomers and later
bloomers. One young man comes
in—the prize rookie of the year.
But we have to take him under
tenure for the next 45 years. And
we have the other problem of the
young man we dismiss now who
wins the Nobel Prize 15 years
later."
A second question that popped up
quickly was: Will the University
place more emphasis in the future
on the graduate or on the under
graduate level?
Dr. Sterling answered that there
will be increased emphasis on our
lower divisions. According to re
cent recommendations, Berkeley and
Westwood will be increasingly up
per division and graduate schools,
and Stanford will have greater op
portunities than ever to be the
outstanding four-year undergradu
ate school on the Coast.
As a university, he added, our
rating is less high than as an
undergraduate school. It's not be
cause our graduate schools arc
not tops, but because they lack
range.
"In those areas in which we do
compete, we compete most success
fully," the president said. Our
graduate schools of Physics, Min
eral Science, Engineering, Mcdi
cinc, Law, and Business, arc among
the tops in their fields, but in many
fields we have no departments at
all."
