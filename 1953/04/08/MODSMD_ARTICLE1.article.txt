Citing five possible causes
of dissension within the gov
ernment of the Soviet Union,
Dr. Raymond H. Fisher of the
UCLA history faculty predict
ed a struggle among Commu
nist chieftains for Josef Stalin's
position but warned Ameri
cans not to "sit back and wait"
for it, as he gave this week's
Tuesday Evening Series lec
ture last night in Memorial Au
ditorium.

Speaking on "After Stalin,
What?" Dr. Fisher named as is
sues the following:
1. Peasant collectivism. .Rus
sian leaders at present are trying
to band the peasants into larger,
more easily managed groups, and
such pressure, if increased, may
"lead to a struggle" which would
contribute to the battle for indi
vidual party leadership.
2. Foreign affairs. A contro
versy has arisen among the party
leaders who are vying for Stalin's
position of party leadership over
Soviet policy toward capitalistic
powers.
Dr. Fisher likened the two sides

of this issue to the plucking of
green or ripe fruit. Certain Rus
sians feel that the capitalistic
countries will eventually grow
soft and fall under Communist
domination. Others favor moving
now to seize the capitalistic coun
tries while they are still "green."
3. Nationalities in the Soviet
Union. Unrest among such na
tionalities as the Ukrainians may
contribute to a struggle
the leaders.
4. People's rights. Dr. Fisher
said that Western people tend to
overemphasize the likelihood of a
revolt of discontented peoples in
Russia, although gestures of dis

content could contribute to a
leadership struggle.
Dr. Fisher named as a fifth
issue the emergence of two pow
erful branches in the government,
the posing of the party against
the secret police. He pointed out
that this issue might serve rather
to de-emphasize a leadership
struggle than add to its severity.
Dr. Fisher drew a parallel be
tween the death of Lenin and that
of Stalin. He pointed out that a
fierce struggle for leadership de
veloped after Lenin's death, and
named the issues which contrib
uted to that fight: rivalry among
leaders, relegation of govern

mental powers, and unsettled is
sues of policy and internal affairs.
He then indicated that these
issues have been either modified
or eliminated in Stalin's case, to
be replaced by the issues men
tioned above.
But in view of the "homoge
neity" and "party feeling" which
marks the present leaders, Dr.
Fisher, although he foresees a
struggle, does not expect it to bo
as fierce as that which followed
Lenin's death in 1924. And he
warns Americans not to expect
Russian collapse as a result of in
ternal strife. That, he said, would
be merely "wishful thinking."

1. Peasant collectivism. .Rus
sian leaders at present are trying
to band the peasants into larger,
more easily managed groups, and
such pressure, if increased, may
"lead to a struggle" which would
contribute to the battle for indi
vidual party leadership.
2. Foreign affairs. A contro
versy has arisen among the party
leaders who are vying for Stalin's
position of party leadership over
Soviet policy toward capitalistic
powers.
Dr. Fisher likened the two sides

of this issue to the plucking of
green or ripe fruit. Certain Rus
sians feel that the capitalistic
countries will eventually grow
soft and fall under Communist
domination. Others favor moving
now to seize the capitalistic coun
tries while they are still "green."
3. Nationalities in the Soviet
Union. Unrest among such na
tionalities as the Ukrainians may
contribute to a struggle
the leaders.
4. People's rights. Dr. Fisher
said that Western people tend to
overemphasize the likelihood of a
revolt of discontented peoples in
Russia, although gestures of dis

content could contribute to a
leadership struggle.
Dr. Fisher named as a fifth
issue the emergence of two pow
erful branches in the government,
the posing of the party against
the secret police. He pointed out
that this issue might serve rather
to de-emphasize a leadership
struggle than add to its severity.
Dr. Fisher drew a parallel be
tween the death of Lenin and that
of Stalin. He pointed out that a
fierce struggle for leadership de
veloped after Lenin's death, and
named the issues which contrib
uted to that fight: rivalry among
leaders, relegation of govern

mental powers, and unsettled is
sues of policy and internal affairs.
He then indicated that these
issues have been either modified
or eliminated in Stalin's case, to
be replaced by the issues men
tioned above.
But in view of the "homoge
neity" and "party feeling" which
marks the present leaders, Dr.
Fisher, although he foresees a
struggle, does not expect it to bo
as fierce as that which followed
Lenin's death in 1924. And he
warns Americans not to expect
Russian collapse as a result of in
ternal strife. That, he said, would
be merely "wishful thinking."
Citing five possible causes
