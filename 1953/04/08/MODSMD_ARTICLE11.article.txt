# Winds Whip Activities Day Exhibits
## 
### 
Campus wheels, shivering as
they huddled behind their wind
blown exhibits, estimated that
somewhere from "six" to "may
be a hundred" students showed
up for Activities Day yesterday
afternoon.
Poor attendance and the coldest
weather of the quarter made the
day a bleak one, before on-again
ofT-again showers, beginning about
3, closed first one and then all the
booths. By 3:45 only KZSU and the
lIR were left, and they too were
preparing to pack up their tables
and posters, and leave Union Court
for any Eskimos who were inter
ested.
Organizations seemed to have re
cruited about three to ten members
each.
Most popular exhibits before the
rains came were KZSU's broadcast
of the baseball game, the YWCA's
"Food for Thought' cookies, and
Chaparral's peep show (which was
censored).
The ofliccrs and members of Ifi
campus organizations turned out for
the activities day, which had been
organized to give students a better
idea of Stanford's extra-curricular
activities.
