# REDS TO FREE 600 POW'S
## Number Disappoints UN Officials 
### 
TOKYO, Wednesday, April 8
(UP)—The Communists said to
day they would return 600 sick
and wounded war prisonesr in'
eluding only 150 non-Koreans.
Disappointed United Nations ne
gotiators at Panmunjom said it
seemed a "small number" as com
pared with the thousands of men
the Reds are holding.
At a 42-minute meeting of liai
son officers today the U.N. offered
to return to the Communists 5,100
Koreans and 700 Chinese.
However, by some coincidence
the ratio of prisoners to be re
leased by the Communists is ap
proximately the same, in relation
to the total number held, as the
proportion to be released by the
Allies.
It was not immediately clear what
effect the Red offer might have on
negotiations for the swap of sick
and wounded, which had pro
gressed smoothly during the first
two days.
Allied officials had hoped the re
turned captives would be numbered
in thousands rather than hundreds.
Read Adm. John C. Daniel, head
of the U.N. liaison team, obviously
was disappointed at the small num
ber. Other sources said the figure
was shocking.
The Communists arc believed
to bold about 12,00 ft prisoners in
eluding some 3,000 Americans. On
Dec. 18, 1951, the Communists
furnished names of 11,559 Allied
I prisoners.
That list included 3,198 Ameri
! cans, 919 British, 234 Turks, 40 Fili
pinos, six Australians, four South
Africans, one each from Canada,
Greece, and Holland, and 7,142
| South Koreans.
At that time the U.N. turned over
names of 132,474 Communist pris
oners in all categories. The figure
later was reduced to 116,000 as ci
vilian internees were released.
Yesterday's agreement that the
exchange would cover even pris
oners with minor disabilities raised
hopes that a large number would
be Returned.
Liaison teams met at 11 a.m. to
day (6 p.m. PST Tuesday), and re
cessed after 42 minutes. They were
to meet again today at 1:30 p.m.

ators iron out final details in the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war.
