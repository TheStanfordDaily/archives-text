# Christian in China Described to YW
## 
### 
The problems of the Christian
and student in Communist China
were described at a YWCA meeting
yesterday by Frank Cooley, field
program director of the Student
Volunteer Movement, who was re
cently deported from China on
charges of espionage and subver
sion.
Cooley described the severe regi
mentation of the Communist regime
and told how students and others
arc assigned jobs by the govern
ment without choice or appeal.
Another problem faced by stu
dents, particularly those who are
Christian, is the constant, withering
barrage of propaganda. This propa
ganda, Cooley asserted, has prompt
ed "most intellectuals to cnthuasi
astically accept" Communism.
Cooley and Billie Blakely, West
ern representatives of the SVM, will
be on campus today until 3 p.m. to
talk to students interested in mis
sionary and other similar work.
They can be contacted through the
YWCA or Memorial Church.
