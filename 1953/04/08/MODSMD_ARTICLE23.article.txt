# The 						Biggest Blood Drive
## 
### 
The biggest, most intensive drive for blood
ever conducted along the Peninsula, now being
held on campus, is obviously booming toward
a successful climax, and the students involved
in its planning - Ken Schechter and crew— and
the students in general should be highly pleas
ed.
So often Stanford is accused of an ivory
tower' unawareness of current world happen
ings. But the blood drive, so dramatically spir
aling toward its 5,000-pint goal, disproves such
a charge. For it demonstrates vividly the stu
dent's concern with the deadly affairs of Korea
ind other war areas, areas desperate for blood
supplies to care for wounded.
The eager determination of some students—
the girls of Durand House and Manzanita and
the fellows of Los Arcos and Theta Xi, groups
whose membership almost as a single voice
pledged blood -show clearly Stanford's pul
sating drive to help, to participate in the vital
duties stemming from the cold war.
And giving blood is a vital duty. Ask the
veterans who are now at Stanford. Ask Ken
Schechter, drive chairman, who flew blind and
wounded over Korea.

They can and will tell you. For they have
seen what the blood posters depict. They have
seen the wounded lying, white with near death,
needing blood.
The Red Cross posters which hang around j
campus with their bloody Scenes might not;
mean much to most students who haven't seen
war in the first hand. But the sincere, straight- j
on look, the ring in the voice of any veteran
talking of the need for blood will convince you
in seconds that blood is needed—desperately
needed — and that it saves lives — countless
lives.
Of this, apparently, many Stanford students
are aware, judging by the immediate and re
markable response to the reguest for sign-ups.
The first day's registration topped 1,000. Yes
terday's added almost another 1,000 persons,
further evidence of the student body's good
will.
But Stanford shouldn't rest, shouldn't lessen
the drive until the 5,000 pint goal is reached.
In fact, it shouldn't rest until that goal is topped
and every person physically able has contrib
uted blood.
