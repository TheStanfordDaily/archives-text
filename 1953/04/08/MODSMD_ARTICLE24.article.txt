### DICK MANSFIELD 
INSPECTOR FAUGH AND THE MAMMOTH
CONTROVERSY
Episode First
Ahnost-no one- remembers it, and of course there is
no record of it in The Daily, but that famous criminol
ogist, Inspector Wadleigh Faugh, met his most baf
fling enigma right here on the Stanford campus. Almost
everyone on the faculty or staff who was implicated

was sent immediately on an ex
change professorship to Central
Tanganyika Poly, and others were
last seen getting into the Hoover
Tower elevator.
Two Geology graduates, pros
pecting for a thesis, had found in
tead a prehistoric mammoth im
bedded in the northern ice cap.
The mammoth was If) feet high
and weighed three tons, .so they
dubbed him Ralph to differentiate

him from USC football players and sent him on to
Stanford. The Geology department threw up its
hands in glee and put Ralph in the front room where
everyone could see. They even hoped that the trustees
would grant them a Ralph for digging up more
mammoths. They had high hopes for Ralph.
That night, Ralph vanished. Frantic geologists wired
to Balboa for intrepid Wadleigh Faugh, who arrived
immediately. He deduced at once, from the lack of
footprints and the fact that Ralph was a cool 1,000,000
years old (until he thawed), that Ralph had not gone
but had rather been taken. Foul play was suspected.

Inspector Faugh spent several sleepless nights. He
shadowed everyone in the Geology department. He
searched Frost Amphitheatre for fresh graves. He
dragged Lake Lagunita, finding a car and SAE's mis
sing lion but no mammoth.
As the days and weeks went by, Inspector Faugh
was at last allowed to transfer his gear from a table in
the Geology library to a room in Encina Hall, and
they gave him a meal ticket and let him eat there. He
employed a horde of freshmen to probe affairs at
Paly High and set up his office in the Encina lounge,
facing the Television. He left no stone unturned, even
looking around the Knoll. No mammoth.
Then, to complicate Inspector Faugh's life, another
puzzle was put up to him. One night, a committee of
outraged Encina men called on him. "See here, Faugh,"
they said. "This is the twenty-third consecutive day
we've had meal bails. Meat balls, Faugh!"
"Tnue," said Faugh, his keen analytical mind in
stantly at work. "Meat balls." And when he had pond
ered, he realized that they had had meat bails for as
long as he could remember. Frightful! Was the dieti
cian balmy? Was the grinder stuck? How about the
cook?
So Inspector Faugh was faced with not one, but
two apparently uncrackable cases on one campus. A
mammoth had disappeared at Geology corner, and
meat balls refused to do likewise at Encina. One puz
zle of the sort would be enough for any man and most
detectives, but Faugh forged ahead.
