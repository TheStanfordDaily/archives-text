# Film Classic Moulin Rouge Finds Beauty In Life of Dwarfed Artist, Says Critic
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
The artist Henri de Toulouse-
Lautrec sought and found beauty
in a place where the world as a
whole saw only ugliness, the
gutters of Paris.
Now another great artist, John Hu
ston, has sought and found beauty in
life of the artist himself. And Huston
has produced one of the classics of
film land, "Moulin Houge."
Toulouse-Lautrec was a deformed
gnome. Yet his ugliness was dwarfed
by the beauty of his art, for in his
painting, he captured the joy and
strength of life, which he himself
never attained.
The movie would be worth seeing
if for no other reason than that it
shows many of his paintings, but
more than this, the movie itself is
a work of art.
Each scene has been constructed
for beauty. The dialogues are con
ducted with the speakers in portrait
like poses.
The movie's unusual colors and
near-sighted camera tchnique, with
the foreground clear, and the back
ground hazy, rightfully won it many

special awards.
Even a scene where the artist con
templates suicide is shot with a bi
zarre, yet beautiful, green predomi
nating.
The plot of the picture runs a dis
tant second to the setting. It is like
a visitor to an art gallery, wandering
slowly from scene to scene.
Sometimes the plot gives up alto
gether, but it is at these places that
the movie often reaches its greatest
heights.
At tremendous expense, a replica
of Moulin Rouge, a rip-roaring Paris
bistro of the 1890's, has been construc
ed in full.

Here we see an
incredible repli
ca of the Paris of
old after dark,
and as we see
this gay kaleido
scope and watch
the artist's hand
furiously attempt
to recapture the
action before him

on a tablecloth, we begin to see it
all as he did. bawdy, but beautiful.
Buried under this avalanche of
color is some sparkling repartee

written by Anthony Wilier ami the
versatile Mr. Huston.
We particularly recall the scene
where the artist defends his drinking
to his punctilious father, and another
t when he silences a lady who berates
him for choosing such "shocking"
' subject matter to paint.
But the slow-motion plot and bub
bling dialogue are the supporting
players to thi* real stars of the pic
ture, the paintings and the settings
of Paris.
Actor Jose Ferrer enjoys his usual
field day in the leading role, but it's
difficult to discern whether his abil- ;
ity or his flawless make-up job brings
about the success of his portrayal.
Among the ladies he chases, or vice
versa are Collette Marchand, Suzan
ne Flon, and Zsa-Zsa Gabor. These j
three are excellent, mediocre, and
lousy-lousy, respectively.
It is not often one sees a movia
where the scenery steals the scene! i
from the actors, but .it happens in
.Moulin Koiikc.
The movie, which was taken from
; Pierre Mure's book of the same
name is currently playing at the
] United Artists theater in San Fran
