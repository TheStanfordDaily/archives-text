# Signups Approaching Hallway Mark Toward 5,000-Pint Goal in Blood Drive
## 
### DOROTHY DODGE 
Signups for the blood drive
climbed near the half way mark
for the campus' giant goal of
5,000 pints yesterday, with about
2,400 signups estimated by drive
officials late last night.
Two houses, Guthrie and Phi Psi,
reported that 100 per cent of their
residents had signed to give blood.
Other houses and groups with high
registration are: Delts, 98 per cent;
Los Arcos, 96 per cent; Durand, 97
per cent; Alpha Sigs, 94 per cent;
and the Oaks, 92 per cent.
The red and white tags reading
"I've Signed Up—Have You?" are
sprouting everywhere on Quad as
signups increase. The Excom room
has been turned into an appoint
ment - recording center, bustling
with charts, Alpha Phi Omegas, and
other Blood Drive workers.
Charts outside the Cellar record
the comparative living group rec
ords and one big poster shows how
the campus as a whole is doing.
Records are by percentage of those

who can give signed up to donate
and those who cannot, signed up to
work. In other words, in order to
count for a house, a person who is
physically ineligible must be signed
up to work in the Pavilion during
the drive.
Personnel Chairman Lorraine
Wilbur reports that workers are
especially needed for noon hours.
All persons interested are asked
to contact their living group rep
resentatives.
Students who live on campus and
in the Village can make appoint
ments to donate with their living
group representatives. The repre
sentatives then turn the names in
to the appointment center in the
Union between noon and 2 p.m. and
from 5:15 to 8:15 p.m. Appoint
ments can also be phoned in to DA
3-809G or DA 3-7712.
OfT-campus students, faculty, and
other University employees, and
wives of both groups have been in
dividually contacted. Signup tables
are also set up at the Cellar, on En
gineering corner, and in Memorial
Court.
Giving blood takes about an

hour. Donors should plan not to
eat anything except fruit juice,
black coffee, and dry toast for
four hours before giving.
Everyone is asked to make an ap
pointment, even if he thinks he may
not be able to give. The Red Cross
will disqualify all ineligible donors
in the medical history section of the
Pavilion donation center during the
drive itself. The only exceptions
are the persons who:
1. Cannot meet the IS to (>0 age
requirement.
2. Weigh less than 110 pounds.
!]. Have had infectious jaundice.
4. Have given blood within
three months.
5. Have an acute cold.
0. Are pregnant or have had a
baby in the past year.
The Red Cross will turn the Pa
vilion into a giant 72-bed collection
center for donation week starting
Monday. Blood collecting opera
tions in the entire four-county area
served by the San Jose center have
been closed down for the week to
make the necessary equipment
available.

Signups for the blood drive
climbed near the half way mark
for the campus' giant goal of
5,000 pints yesterday, with about
2,400 signups estimated by drive
officials late last night.
Two houses, Guthrie and Phi Psi,
reported that 100 per cent of their
residents had signed to give blood.
Other houses and groups with high
registration are: Delts, 98 per cent;
Los Arcos, 96 per cent; Durand, 97
per cent; Alpha Sigs, 94 per cent;
and the Oaks, 92 per cent.
The red and white tags reading
"I've Signed Up—Have You?" are
sprouting everywhere on Quad as
signups increase. The Excom room
has been turned into an appoint
ment - recording center, bustling
with charts, Alpha Phi Omegas, and
other Blood Drive workers.
Charts outside the Cellar record
the comparative living group rec
ords and one big poster shows how
the campus as a whole is doing.
Records are by percentage of those

who can give signed up to donate
and those who cannot, signed up to
work. In other words, in order to
count for a house, a person who is
physically ineligible must be signed
up to work in the Pavilion during
the drive.
Personnel Chairman Lorraine
Wilbur reports that workers are
especially needed for noon hours.
All persons interested are asked
to contact their living group rep
resentatives.
Students who live on campus and
in the Village can make appoint
ments to donate with their living
group representatives. The repre
sentatives then turn the names in
to the appointment center in the
Union between noon and 2 p.m. and
from 5:15 to 8:15 p.m. Appoint
ments can also be phoned in to DA
3-809G or DA 3-7712.
OfT-campus students, faculty, and
other University employees, and
wives of both groups have been in
dividually contacted. Signup tables
are also set up at the Cellar, on En
gineering corner, and in Memorial
Court.
Giving blood takes about an

hour. Donors should plan not to
eat anything except fruit juice,
black coffee, and dry toast for
four hours before giving.
Everyone is asked to make an ap
pointment, even if he thinks he may
not be able to give. The Red Cross
will disqualify all ineligible donors
in the medical history section of the
Pavilion donation center during the
drive itself. The only exceptions
are the persons who:
1. Cannot meet the IS to (>0 age
requirement.
2. Weigh less than 110 pounds.
!]. Have had infectious jaundice.
4. Have given blood within
three months.
5. Have an acute cold.
0. Are pregnant or have had a
baby in the past year.
The Red Cross will turn the Pa
vilion into a giant 72-bed collection
center for donation week starting
Monday. Blood collecting opera
tions in the entire four-county area
served by the San Jose center have
been closed down for the week to
