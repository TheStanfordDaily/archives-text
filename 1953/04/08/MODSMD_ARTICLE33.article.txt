I have often been at track meets where those around me tense up before
the starter's gun. I do the same myself. But what does the runner think
about before the race?
I went out to Angell Field last week and asked Fred George, one of
Stanford's top 140 men, what he thinks about before a race and during
a race.
"I'm plenty scared. I have trouble talking to people before a race, but
I dont get sick to my stomach like of the fellows do. For one thing.
1 try to forget about it, but that is impossible and before any race I have
already run it about 30 times in my mind.
"During a race there isn't much to think about but running. I usually
have a fair idea if I am going to win or not. When I hear short, choppy
footsteps, I keep thinking that any moment someone will zip by me and
that's just about what usually happens.
"There's a lot of strategy during a race, especially a 440. It's important
to have the right position on the turns. As a frosh it doesn't make much
difference what you don't know because no one else knows much either.
But last year as a sophomore I really learned a lot, but in the,process it cost
me a few races."
Fred tells me that a great deal of track is mind over matter. In fact,
Coach Jack Weiershauser often says that half the running of a good race is
thinking that you can do it. And George concurs that confidence plays
an important part.
George's favorite race is the 220. though he doesn't run it. because it
is over quickly, requires speed, not endurance, and it is not too longt
nor is it too short.
"I also like the 440, but I don't have a good enough start to really cut down
my time. That's why I don't run the 220, as a good start is half the battle."
George's best ever in the 440 was a 48:8 mark posted last year. In
the mile relay he has done a 47:2 and says the difference is from the run
ning start. He's working on his start a lot this year.
I asked George if he thought speed was something that could be de
veloped.
"Speed can f>e built up to a certain point. A fast man can be made
faster, but a slow man cannot be made speedy. And the improvement
in speed is small at any rate. Wind and endurance can be built but speed
to the greater extent is innate."
George spends about three-quarters of the year in training but eases up
following the June meets and then starts up again in October.
For his greatest track thrill George recalls a spring day in 1950 when he j
Was stiil in Lowell High. It was a meet against powerful Washington and '
George won his own race, the 440, plus a surprise first in the 220, which he |
didn't enter for the points but for the exercise. Then he wound up the day I
as anchor man on the winning relay team which decided the meet.
And his biggest disappointment was last May whtn he finished third in
the California meet behind two Bears whom he feels he should have done
better against and whom he did beat in later encounters at various meets.

I asked George why he went out for track?
"Primarily I like it. I like the athletic competition, and I like to run. '
I get a kick tint of it. But I would never do it if I had to run the distances
... When I get out of school I could run for one of the local clubs, but I
hope I shall be in medical school and if so won't have the time."
1 asked George a bit more about those distance runners.
"They are in a class by themselves. They are men among men. Why, when
you run a sprint or even a middle distance run the race is over before
you really get tired. But when you're in a mile or two mile distance race
you are tired way before the race is over; sometimes this happens even
in an 880. And from that point of initial tiring, the rest is endurance and
guts.
"Distance runners are all marked by that quality of endurance. With
other track men there is no factor which characterizes them from any
one else with tiie exception of (he weight men who are usually pretty
hefty."
I had to let Fred go as Weiershauser was calling him to take a couple
of practice passes of the relay baton. The USC meet is only four days
away.
