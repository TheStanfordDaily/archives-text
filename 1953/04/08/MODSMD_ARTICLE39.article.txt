# Ruggers Face C.O.P.
## 
### JACK RANNELLS 
Pupil meets teacher this after
noon at 3:30 on the Stanford rugby
field when Coach Pete Kmetovic's
Indian rugby meets the "just
learning" College of Pacific Tigers.
Late in February, the Stanford
varsity played the Olympic Club of
San Francisco at Stockton in a game
which introduced the granddaddy
of football to the COP campus.
Since that time the Tigers have
themselves organized a team which
is led by Tom McCormick, voted
most valuable back of the year in
Northern California while playing
lor the Pacific football team last fall.
Because the Stocktonites have
just taken up the sport there is
little basis for comparison be
t ween today's foes.
Today's contest will be even
more equalized by the fact that
the Indians will be without the
services of Vince Jones, Bill Mc-
Mahon. and probably Al Kirk
land and Ron Bush, both injured
in the game aganst Cal this past
weekend, all of whom figured
prominently in the Cards' early
season victories.
