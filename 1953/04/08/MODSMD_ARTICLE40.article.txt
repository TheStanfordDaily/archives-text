# Indian Baseballers Conquer Rain, Gators, 7 to 2
## 
### DOROTHY DODGE 
Stanford ploughed through
nine cold innings against San
Francisco State yesterday after
noon and ended up on top 7 to 2.
Only a few fans sprinkled the
stands, and fewer still outlasted the
five-minute break caused by rain
in the eighth inning. About the
only time they stopped shivering
long enough to stand up and show
some excitement was when Indian

leftfielder Chuck Essegian bounced
another one over the wall to bring
in himself and catcher Jack Shep
ard.
It was Essegian's tenth and the
2Gth collegiate homer tagged in the
Sunken Diamond since it was built
in 1961.
The two squads finished the first
inning tied 1 to 1, but San Fran
cisco only succeeded in completing
one more in the fifth, while Stan
ford continued to pile them up
steadily.
Second baseman Kich Scrama
glia arrived back at the plate
alter a single to account for the
first run. In the second inning,

center fielder Dick Cole got credit
for the second after some inter
esting; byplay which saw:
1. S.F. pitcher Joe Heekman
chasing Cole around the plate.
2. Ileckman and plate umpire
Koxie Silvera in heated discus
sion.
3 Silvera motion Heekman to
the dugout.
4. Heekman return t6 the
mound as Silvera apparently re
lented.
A San Francisco third base error
brought Shepard in after a walk in
the fourth. Essegian's homer sent
him across the plate a. second time
in the sixth. And he scored his

third time for the afternoon in the
eighth, on a single by third baseman
Ray Swarfs.
Essegian's round-tripper was the
only break in a line of straight sin
gles. Swarts managed two for four,
and Shepard one for two.
Everett Dean's -baseballers play
their next games this weekend,
when they meet COP Friday and
the Stanford alumni Saturday.
