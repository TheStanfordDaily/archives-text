# Blood—From Cot to Korea

### DOROTHY DODGE 
Where will it go—that pint of
blood you'll give during next week's
drive?
The last you'll see of it is when a
cart bears it away from your bed
side in the Stanford Pavilion. It's
carted out to the loading room, and
there it's put into refrigerated
boxes. ,
The boxes, marked "HUMAN
BLOOD —RUSH," are loaded on
the Red Cross's Santa Clara
County Regional Blood Center
trucks and sent to San Jose.
Trucks will shuttle back and forth
between San Jose and Stanford
constantly during the drive.
In San Jose the types are checked
Vind type "O" blood, which be
given to anyone, is set aside. This
blood goes overseas as whole blood,
for which there is no substitute. It's
rushed to Travis Air Force Base,
where military planes take over to
handle the shipment to Korea.
Other types of blood go from San
Jose to the Cutter Laboratory in
Berkeley or to laboratories in
Southern Caliofrnia. These types
are made into either plasma or se
rum albumin—both for overseas
use. The portion of blood that is not
made into serum albumin is used
in the new gamma globulin to help
fight polio.
Scrum albumin has found valu
able use in Korea for shock treat
ment. A white, flaky substance, it
is carried by medical corpsmen
who have found it especially good
during winter lighting, since, un
like plasma, it doesn't freeze,
"None of the blood from the
Stamford Drive will go into the
commcyxial market," assures Mrs.
Irma F. Barrett, the assistant ad
ministrative director df the Red
Cross Regional Blood Center.


BLOOD SAVED THEIR LlVES—These veterans of Korean fighting owe their lives to blood col
lected by the Red Cross in drives like that currently being held on the Stanford campus. They
were on campus yesterday to tell first-hand of the desperate need for blood along the fighting
front. —Daily photo by Don Cheu
