## Yell Leader Plan Passed Unanimously 
### SUE WHEAT 
Associate Editor, The Daily
Excom last night ended a
week-long controversy as it vot
ed unanimous approval of a new
plan for electing the ASSU head
yell leader.
Because the plan involves a change
in the ASSU Constitution, its final
acceptance will depend on a referen
dum vote of the student body to be
held April 29.
The plan provides that the four
assistant yell leaders shall qualify
as nominees for the post of head yell
leader and shall be elected by the
student body in the ASSU spring
elections. This year the head yell
leader candidates will be nominated
in the usual way—by petition.
The approved plan is essentially
the one proposed by Daily Editor
Jini Madison at Excom on Feb.
2(i. The provision outlining the
nomination procedure of head yell
leader, however, was supplied 1 by
Roy Alexander, president of Car
dinals. Cardinals originally
sparked the movement to change
the method of electing the head
yell leader.
It was believed that the contro
versy had ended on Feb. 26 when
Excom voted eight to seven to adopt
Madison's plan. But it was later
found that a three-fourths approval
by Excom is necessary before a con
stitutional changc may be made.
This invalidated Excom's closc
vote and set the controversy rolling
all over again. '
Excom also approved the Fun
damental Standard - Honor Code
booklet drawn up and presented by
Jan Jacobs and Dick Andrews. It
appropriated $140 to the committee
for the publication of 10,000 copies
of the booklet. According to An
drews, the booklet will be sent to
incoming freshmen, used for the
education of students already at
Stanford, be distributed to faculty
members, and be available for dis
tribution to other schools.
The Student Public Relations
Board bccamc the eleventh ad
ministrative board of the ASSU,
as Excom approved an -amend
ment to the ASSU constitution
which made Pub Rel a permanent
board. Nancy Clark, director of
the board, presented the amend
ment and reported on the status
of the student public relations.
Debate Manager Dave Jacobson
presented further amendments to
the ASSU by-laws which reconsti
tute the Debate Board as the Speech
Activities Board. Excom approved
Jacobson's proposals.

Associate Editor, The Daily
Excom last night ended a
week-long controversy as it vot
ed unanimous approval of a new
plan for electing the ASSU head
yell leader.
Because the plan involves a change
in the ASSU Constitution, its final
acceptance will depend on a referen
dum vote of the student body to be
held April 29.
The plan provides that the four
assistant yell leaders shall qualify
as nominees for the post of head yell
leader and shall be elected by the
student body in the ASSU spring
elections. This year the head yell
leader candidates will be nominated
in the usual way—by petition.
The approved plan is essentially
the one proposed by Daily Editor
Jini Madison at Excom on Feb.
2(i. The provision outlining the
nomination procedure of head yell
leader, however, was supplied 1 by
Roy Alexander, president of Car
dinals. Cardinals originally
sparked the movement to change
the method of electing the head
yell leader.
It was believed that the contro
versy had ended on Feb. 26 when
Excom voted eight to seven to adopt
Madison's plan. But it was later
found that a three-fourths approval
by Excom is necessary before a con
stitutional changc may be made.
This invalidated Excom's closc
vote and set the controversy rolling
all over again. '
Excom also approved the Fun
damental Standard - Honor Code
booklet drawn up and presented by
Jan Jacobs and Dick Andrews. It
appropriated $140 to the committee
for the publication of 10,000 copies
of the booklet. According to An
drews, the booklet will be sent to
incoming freshmen, used for the
education of students already at
Stanford, be distributed to faculty
members, and be available for dis
tribution to other schools.
