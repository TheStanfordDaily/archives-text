# Flans Conflict Over Center
## 
### 
Preliminary plans for a multi- j
million-dollar shopping center to be j
built by Palo Alto merchants a mere
block from the site of Stanford's
proposed center were unveiled j
Tuesday night at a citizens' meeting ,
in Palo Alto. .
But with the announcement of
plans came, a stern warning: that .
two centers competing within the
same commercial area would meet
with financial disaster.
The warning was sounded by
one of the nation's leading center
developers, David D. Bohannon,
who advi&ed that if both Stanford >
and Palo Alto go ahead with
present plans for centers both will
be "financial fiascos."
Stanford has long discussed the
possibility of developing a shop
ping center, and serious planning
for such a project got under way
this year.
The Stanford center would be
constructed in a triangular area
between the Palo Alto Hospital,
San Francisquita Creek, and El Ca
in ino Real. It is planned that the
center will include a large depart
ment store as well as a number of
smaller shops.
The proposed Palo Alto center
would be luil a stone's throw
away, bordering on Alma Street,
Cowper, and San Francisquito
Creek.
In discussing the possibility of a
shopping center in Palo Alto, Bo
hannon insisted the city is a natural
for a center and would draw cus
tomers from areas as distant as Los
Gatos, 22 miles south of Palo Alto.
But, he said, "There will have to
be one such center in the Palo Alto
Mrea."
"You'll have to rjfride whether
it will he in the C|ty or at Stan
fordâ€”one or the other, not both."
Stanford's Alf Brandin was ab
sent from campus yesterday and
was not available for comment.
However, in a recent conversation
with the Daily, he indicated that
the University will not curtail its
planning activities for a center be
cause of the Palo Alto project.
