### 
KAPENGURIA, Kenya, April 8
(UP) —Jomo "Burning Spear" Ken
yatta, Moscow-trained leader of the
Mau Mau murder ring, and five of
his chief lieutenants were sentenced
to prison for 10 years today.
In an eight-hour summation of
the case, Judge Ransley S. Thacker
said Kenyatta organized the Mau
Mau to drive white men out of this
British African colony and, "if nec
essary, to kill them."
The bearded African agitator ve
hemently denied the charge, saying
that his trial was a scheme to
"strangle the Kenya African Union"
—a political organization to which
all six defendants belong.
Security precautions through
out Kenya were redoubled today
in anticipation of retaliatory at
tacks by members of the secret
society of African assassins.
The 10-year sentences imposed by
Thacker were the maximum pos
sible under the law, but he told an
audience composed largely of white
women that they are "inadequate."
