# Apathy or Poor Planning?
## 
### 
"Student apathy"* is getting to be an old
stand-by term that professors and student
leaders fall back on to explain the failure of
some project designed by them to benefit the
student.
Sometimes the term expresses a valid ex
planation. But more often it merely furnishes
an excuse to overlook the real causes of its
failure.
One such project—a dismal failure--was Ac
tivities Day. Under the sponsorship of Cardi
nals, campus organizations set up booths and
tables in Union Court Tuesday afternoon hop
ing to explain their purposes and functions to
interested students and to recruit new members
to swell their staffs.
Well, the "interested" students didn't show.
And here's why:
1..C01d, drizzly weather. (This we'll con
cede as being beyond the control of the best
of planners.)
2. Poor publicity. Here again, Cardinals
ran into hard luck. Two other campus events
requiring extensive, long-range publicity, the

Stanford—Today and Tomorrow program'
and the blood drive, were monopolizing
space on campus bulletin boards, the Book
store windows, and the Daily, and Activities
Day was relegated to meager, last-minute
publicity.
3. Lack of enthusiasm on the part of the plan
ners. No one is going to knock himself out to
push a project he isn't particularly interested in
—and a sincere belief in the value of the project
was not evident on the part of the Cardinals
members responsible for the project.
Cardinals, don't try to blame the failure of
Activities Day on an apathetic student body.
Rather, evaluate the project itself. If you decide
there is a need for an Activities Day, let these
rules guide your next attempt to stage one:
1. Pick a week during which other events
will not be engaging student interest and you
will be as-sured adequate publicity.
2. Hand the responsibility of the project to
Cardinals members convinced of its value and
willing to sacrifice hard work to make it a suc
cess. — Sue Wheat
