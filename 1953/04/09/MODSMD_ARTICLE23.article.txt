# Our Changing Definitions

### 
A short item in the San Francisco Chronicle
the other day carried the news that Walter
Gieseking, a German pianist and alleged pro-
Nazi, will be allowed to enter the United States
again.
A Mr. Esperdy of the U.S. Immigration De
partment, in explaining the event, was guoted
as saying that under the McCarran Act which
aims to exclude members of any totalitarian
party, Gieseking was "not excludable."
Members of a totalitarian party, he added,
"means Communists."
Come, come, Mr. Esperdy. Does this mean
that Nazis are not also members of a totalitarian
party?
Or does it mean that the United States'
definition of totalitarianism, at least as ex
pressed in our immigration laws, depends on
who we happen to be lighting at the moment?
Whether or not it is a wise policy to exclude
members of totalitarian parties from the United
States is debatable. But like it or not, the Mc-
Carran Act sets forth such a policy, and as law

•
commands a certain respect and obedience.
To the immigration authorities striving tor
a logical interpretation and execution of the
Act, this much should be clear: if the United
States is going to keep Communists out of the
country, then it must also exclude Nazis and
members of all totalitarian parties.
To fail to do so indicates an of an
expedient definition of totalitarianism
Of course a differentiation must be made be
tween the different purposes for which aliens
seek admission. A fifth-column agent owing
allegiance to a foreign dictatorship, for ex
ample, certainly cannot be eguated to a musi
cian or artist who happens to be a Nazi, but is
seeking sentry in a non-political capacity.
Mr. Gieseking wants to come to the United
States to give piano recitals. His presence in
that capacity can hardly be construed as a
threat to the preservation of our democracy.
While endorsing Mr. Esperdy's decision to
admit Gieseking, we can hardly approve the
childish reasoning by which he arrived at it.
