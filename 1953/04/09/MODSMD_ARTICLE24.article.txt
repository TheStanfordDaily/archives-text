## Velde: 'Of Dubious Character' 
### 
To the Editor:
Dr. Richard B. Lewis awoke on the morning of
Murch 31, the day following his appearance before
the House Un-American Activities Committee, se
cure in the knowledge that he was still employed as
a professor at San Jose State. Dr. Lewis was a
"friendly witness" ... a "useful source of informa
tion" to the committee. He voluntarily testified against
himself and former friends. Dr. Lewis says that the
committee "leafted over backwards" to be fair to him.
Abraham Minkus awoke on the morning of March
31, the day following his appearance before the House
Un-American Activities Committee, to discover that
he was of that day suspended as a teacher in the
City School System of Los Angeles. Mr. Minkus
was an "unfriendly witness"—he neither testified
against himself or friends. Mr. Minkus does not
think the committee was either fair or considerate.
Here are two educators whose statements about
their treatment by this committee differ sharply.
And Mr. RofT, unequivocally, chose to accept,as gos
pel the words of a confessed informer who was
economically rewarded for his testimony by being
allowed to keep his job. On the basis of Lewis'
statements, Mr. KolT tells us that Mr. Velde. chair
man of the Committee, is "marked with a spirit of
high consciensiousness."
Has he forgotten that this is the same Mr. Velde
who last month admittedly falsely accused Mrs. Agnes
Myers, wife of the chairman of the Washington Post,
of having written an article favorable to the Soviet
Union that she did not write (Christian Century, Mar.
4) . . . the same Mr. Velde, of whom the Chicago
Sun-Times, which supported Eisenhower, referred to
as "of dubious character and outright Ignorance" . . .
the same Mr Velde who last year unsuccessfully at
tempted to order the Library of Congress to mark
all subversive material in its 9 million volumes . . .
the same Mr. Velde who opposed appropriations to
education because he suspected that some educators
might be Communists . . . the same Mr. Velde who
"aghast even his committee members" when he pro

posed investigating churches. (Time, Mar. 23) . . .
the same Mr. Velde who by his proposal caused
the National Council of Churches of Christ by a
vote of G9 to 2 to criticize "certain methods" of Con
gressional Committees (Nation, Mar. 21) . . . the same
Mr. Velde whose actions led Franklin Roosevelt Jr.
to introduce a resolution condemning him and recom
mending that he be fired.
Yes, Mr. Rolf, we agree that Mr. Velde is consci
entious—conscientious in his determination to in
stigate thought control in America, regardless of
the costs in life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness.
No witness before Mr. Velde's committee is free
from the pressure of "third degree methods" tin
less you consider I hi' fear of losing one's job a
minor threat.
Mr. RofT says that the freedoms witness are
solely predicated on the individual bi nefs of the com
mittee chairman. Is he saying that the freedoms
guaranteed by the Constitution, the supreme law of
the land, can not legally be invoked by witnesses
before this committee? We do not need a new rule
by Congress to protect these witnesses; we only need
an adherence to some very old rules guaranteed in
our Constitution, ft was when these witnesses in
voked the freedoms guaranteed in the Constitution
that D. Lewis called them "obstreperous." Perhaps
Mr. RofT should reexamine Dr. Ix>wis' comments in
the light ol his own plea—and we plead with him—
for the unbreachable rights of the witnesses.
As Jes.se Carter, Justice of the Supreme Court of
California, commented recently (The Recorder, Mar
30):
"Never has the security of our nation as well as
our personal security been more severly threatened
than at the present time—this threat to our se
< nrily is the growing tendency toward limitation of
the principles guaranteed by the first 10 amend
ments."
Perhaps Mr. RofT can practice what he preaches,
and ask of one of the "unfriendly witnesses" the
same questions he asked pf Dr. Lewis, and print the
reply. JAN HOWARD
