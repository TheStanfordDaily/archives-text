# Junior Weekend Plans Formed
## 
### 
An old tradition —Junior Week
end—will be revived by the junior
class May 1-3, Stan Chapman, class
president, announced yesterday.
The weekend will consist of a
Sunday water carnival and a Fri
day class reunion at Hossotti's.
Activities for the Saturday date,
Chapman said, are still in the plan
ning stages.
Theme for the wate r carnival,
traditionally a part of the Junior
Weekend activities, will be a "South
Seas Regatta."
F.uch living group planning to
enter a float must register it in
the ASSU office before Wednes
day, April 29. Similarly, each liv
ing group is asked to appoint a

member, preferably a junior, to be
chairman of his group for the
carnival.
Living group representatives,
once they are appointed, should
contact Pete Sabin, water carnival
chairman, at Theta Xi, Chapman
aid.
Sabin is assisting Jack Crossfield,
who was named by Chapman as
chairman for the weekend. Bob Mc-
Cune is class day chairman.
Information sheets announcing the
Junior Weekend have been distrib
uted to living groups. Additional
copies are available from Sabin.
Originally, Junior Wcek e u d
consisted of the Junior Prom,
water erunival, and class reunion.
