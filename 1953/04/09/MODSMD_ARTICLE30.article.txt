## Korean Armistice Would Create Knotty Problems 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 8 (UP) —The Eisenhower administration
was girding itself today for a host of domestic and Far Eastern
problems that would inevitably follow any Korean armistice.
Anxious to end the war if possible on honorable terms, the ad
ministration already has begun to sound warnings against de-

mands for swift return of U.S."
troops t from Korea and for deep
cuts in defense spending.
Such knotty problems as South
Korea's attitude on a settlement
that fails to unite all Korea, ex
pected Red Chinese demands for
Formosa, and other Far East is
sues are certain to complicate ef
forts to achieve permanent set
tlements in the Far East.
There is no major drive as yet
for a big defense fund slash at
home.
One touchy question is South
Korea's insistence that all Korea
he "unified" before a final settle
ment is reached. There is a pos
sibility the South Koreans may
refuse to stop fighting even if
there is an armistice.
Some thought is being given a
plan that would move the North-
South Korean boundary some 80
miles north of the 38th parallel, the
pre-war dividing line. This would
give the South Koreans a more bal
anced economy with industrial and
power resources.
