### DICK MALTZMAN 
Round and round the big wheel goes and where it stops everyone
knows, damnit, but few are prone to admit—on the big maroon and gold
SC number. No matter how you figure it. Stanford only comes out on top
il you give the Cards every available variable. The Indians, no matter how
hard they try, just can't be figured on for every possible variable.
hi every event, every Stanford man is a crucial cog in the Big Red
M- chine. A slip by one can mean the slip for the whole of "Operation
Trojan." Unfortunately, unlike the Greeks, we don't have the "big
.'lorse" that can do the job. The pressure is on each trackman to win or
(he entire team loses.
We feel that Stanford has the material to win and the skill to win— |
but the number of come through performances required are too many j
to ask for. After all, Southern C'al does have better material in most
events. If we at-e strong this year (and we are), the criterion of our j
strength does not rest with the defeat of SC, it rests with how well our
team can do overall and what times we can post. SC has more track men
tei itering their school than we do and have more material to develop or
material that is already developed. To compete in the top echelons in a
lew events with SC is possible, but once you get past that thin line of top
flight performers, you find SC has what it takes to beat Stanford for 20
straight years and only lose two dual meets in 25 years. "SC is great in
track" sums it up nicely.
But back to this year. In order to win, the way we have it doped out, I
Stanford will need:
1. A sweep in the 880-yard run. A distinct possibility if Bob Simon runs |
the half , but tight if they run him in the two-mile for the one-two there.
We need the one-two in the two-mile.
2. Someone has to come through with some secondary points in the
mile after Simon, Bob Reed or Russ Ferguson will try to break in for a I
point or three.
!5. The above mentioned "Bi}> Horse" in the Trojan War just might be
a rather noteworthy young man named Bob Mathias. The points that are
needed are Mathias' seconds and thirds. To give us a chance, he has to
take a second in the highs and a second in the discus. Parry O'Brien
has a four-foot longer heave and Bill Wright has cleared the high sticks
seconds faster than Mathias has this season. Leave us all pray. And
more, we have the Trojans blanking us in the high jump—Bob is about
the only man possible who can break through the Trojan trio of 6' 3"
plus jumpers.
4. That old Stanford weakness, the pole vault, is also an SC weakness
v, is year. Only SC's Dick Hecht has cleared 13 feet or better for either
team. Jim Mclndoe has the potential to get up there, and the team of
he and Dick Jaqua will have to come through with at least four points
in the event. If the rumor that Hecht has hurt his ankle is true, things
could look up.
£>. And the big crucial—the sprints. In order to even have a chance of
winning, we must take first and second in the hundred and place in the
The team of Jack Davis, Jim Lea, and Verle Sorgen will try and sweep
v.ie furlong.
Iri what we say above, there is one factor that may make or break
Stanford's chances—the wind that has been blowing us to pieces all
week. If the wind is strong, Davis can't possibly win the 220 and then
the lows less than 15-minutes later. And the wind is always a head
wind on the sprinters, which will aid runners like Maury Parsons and
Mathias. In the discus, the wind is a tail wind which forces down the
discus, hurting a moose like O'Brien and helping a form man like Bob.
i >r the Stanfords, we had better be praying that "Die Luft der Freiheit
Weht" this Saturday—and in the right direction.
