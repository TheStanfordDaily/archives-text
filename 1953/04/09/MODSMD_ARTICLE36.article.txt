# Trackman Bob Simon Qualities as 'Daily' Athlete
## 
### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
(Simon edged out frosh speedsters Jim Lutrell and Jim Truher in
the Athlete of the Week polling).
When Bob Simon came from behind in the last lap of the mile
race of last Saturday's quadrangular track meet, reassumed the
lead he had momentarily lost, and went on to win in the time of
4:13.9, it marked the fourth fastest time in which this distance

h;is been traversed by a Stanford
athlete. For his fine performance,
Hob has been named The Daily's
\thlete of the Week."
Outstanding as his performance
of last Saturday was, it was not
Simon's best recorded time for the
distance in his three years as a
varsity cinderman. Last year, at the
Modesto Relays, he reeled off a
4:12.8 mile, third best time in the
'hool's history. Considerihg that
the season is still in its early stages,
however, Simon's effort puts him far
ahead of his pace of last year, and
Coach Jack Weiershauser is certain
that Bob will easily crack the Uni
versity record of 4:11.5 set by Paul
Moore in 1940. Moreover, Weiers
v iu.ter believes that the lanky miler
will be cruising under 4:10 before the
season draws to a close. Simon only
says,"I certainly hope so."
Bob's specialty is the mile, and he
admits to liking it best. So far this
spring, only two milers in the coun
try have posted better outdoor times:
. "nice Drummond at Oklahoma with
4:12.3 and Ted Lundquist at Okla
homa A&M with 4:12.8.
In addition to the mile, Simon is
equally profficient at the other dis
tance events. When asked where he
will run Simon against USC in ad
dition to the mile, Coach Weiershau

ser responded, "You tell me. His
time for the 880 is tops for the team
this season. Also, he holds the
school record in the two mile at 9:19.
I'm really not sure yet. but what
ever he runs in. you can be sure he
will be mighty tough to beat."
Bob, now a senior, lives at the
AKL house, and in addition is a
member of the Men's Council.

In addition to the mile, Simon is
equally profficient at the other dis
tance events. When asked where he
will run Simon against USC in ad
dition to the mile, Coach Weiershau

ser responded, "You tell me. His
time for the 880 is tops for the team
this season. Also, he holds the
school record in the two mile at 9:19.
I'm really not sure yet. but what
ever he runs in. you can be sure he
will be mighty tough to beat."

(Simon edged out frosh speedsters Jim Lutrell and Jim Truher in
the Athlete of the Week polling).
When Bob Simon came from behind in the last lap of the mile
race of last Saturday's quadrangular track meet, reassumed the
lead he had momentarily lost, and went on to win in the time of
4:13.9, it marked the fourth fastest time in which this distance

h;is been traversed by a Stanford
athlete. For his fine performance,
Hob has been named The Daily's
\thlete of the Week."
Outstanding as his performance
of last Saturday was, it was not
Simon's best recorded time for the
distance in his three years as a
varsity cinderman. Last year, at the
Modesto Relays, he reeled off a
4:12.8 mile, third best time in the
'hool's history. Considerihg that
the season is still in its early stages,
however, Simon's effort puts him far
ahead of his pace of last year, and
Coach Jack Weiershauser is certain
that Bob will easily crack the Uni
versity record of 4:11.5 set by Paul
Moore in 1940. Moreover, Weiers
v iu.ter believes that the lanky miler
will be cruising under 4:10 before the
season draws to a close. Simon only
says,"I certainly hope so."
Bob's specialty is the mile, and he
admits to liking it best. So far this
spring, only two milers in the coun
try have posted better outdoor times:
. "nice Drummond at Oklahoma with
4:12.3 and Ted Lundquist at Okla
homa A&M with 4:12.8.
