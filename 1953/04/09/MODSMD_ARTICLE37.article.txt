# Frosh Baseballers Top Sequoia Hi, 9-5
## 
### 
With two consecutive victories under their belts, including
yesterday's 9-5 triumph over Sequoia High, Stanford's freshmen
baseballers appear ready to jell into a tough, well-rounded ball
club.
The frosh scored their runs in batches yesterday, tallying six in

the second and three more in the
sixth behind three-hit pitching by
Jack Heffelfinger, Dan Feltham, atfd
Ray Young.
Five walks, a single by Bob Evans,
and a bases-loaded double by Marc
Sandstrorn featured the second-in
ning uprising. Singles by Rocky Furst
and Mickey Holzman, a two-base
overthrow, and a balk produced the
"bonus" runs in the sixth.
The squad has been going through
hard, regular workouts since the
spring vacation and, according to
Coach Dick Clegg, the quality of
play has begun to pick up. Pitching
is becoming effective and the hit
ting more solid and consistent.
4 Wins, 3 Losses
As of now the club sports a four
win, three-loss record. The frosh
split four games last quarter when
Dutch Fehring and Clegg were shar
ing the coaching duties. Last week
they bowed narrowly to San Lorenzo
High, 5-4. but bounced back to look
good in blanking El Cerrito, 3-0,
and then Sequoia yesterday.
Fehring stated that the team lacked
good over-all speed, but said that
the well-balanced pitching was prob
ably the strong point.
The Papooses boast two crafty
southpaws, A 1 Dunn and Jack Hef
felfinger, who were high school
rivals in Minnesota, and a quartet
of right - handers including Ray
Young, Bob Grey, Dan Feltham,
and Dick Woodward.
The Personnel
Ron Witort has been rapidly im
proving as a catcher and is a steady
ing influence on the pitchers.
Smooth-swinging Jim McDowell,
an expert at digging low throws out
of the dirt, is holding firmly to the
first-base position.

Second baseman Mickey Holzman,
is the key man in the Stanford in
field. A top hitter and a recipient
of many walks, he has easily scored
more runs than any other player on
the club.
Bob Fisher and basketball star
George Selleck are battling for the
shortstop slot. Both are fine fielders.
Fursl at Third
Rocky Furst, another hoopster,
showed promise in his first game
Saturday.
Although nothing Ls set in the out
field, Young, when he isnt pitching,
appears to have the nod in right
with Bob Evans in center. Pete Dahl
was well established in left until
Tuesday when he went on the in
jury list with a sprained ankle.
Marc Sandstrom, Ron Wagner, and
Bill Wright are fighting for the left
field berth while Dahl is out of
action.


BATTING POWER — Marc Sandstrom and Mickey Holzman,
frosh ball players, gave a good account of themselves yesterday
as the frosh defeated Sequoia High 9-5. Sandstrom banged out
a bases-loaded double in the six run second, while Holzman con
tributed a single and double to the cause.

good in blanking El Cerrito, 3-0,
and then Sequoia yesterday.
Fehring stated that the team lacked
good over-all speed, but said that
the well-balanced pitching was prob
ably the strong point.
The Papooses boast two crafty
southpaws, A 1 Dunn and Jack Hef
felfinger, who were high school
rivals in Minnesota, and a quartet
of right - handers including Ray
Young, Bob Grey, Dan Feltham,
and Dick Woodward.
The Personnel
Ron Witort has been rapidly im
proving as a catcher and is a steady
ing influence on the pitchers.
Smooth-swinging Jim McDowell,
an expert at digging low throws out
of the dirt, is holding firmly to the
first-base position.

Second baseman Mickey Holzman,
is the key man in the Stanford in
field. A top hitter and a recipient
of many walks, he has easily scored
more runs than any other player on
the club.
Bob Fisher and basketball star
George Selleck are battling for the
shortstop slot. Both are fine fielders.
Fursl at Third
Rocky Furst, another hoopster,
showed promise in his first game
Saturday.
Although nothing Ls set in the out
field, Young, when he isnt pitching,
appears to have the nod in right
with Bob Evans in center. Pete Dahl
was well established in left until
Tuesday when he went on the in
jury list with a sprained ankle.
Marc Sandstrom, Ron Wagner, and
Bill Wright are fighting for the left
field berth while Dahl is out of
action.


BATTING POWER — Marc Sandstrom and Mickey Holzman,
frosh ball players, gave a good account of themselves yesterday
as the frosh defeated Sequoia High 9-5. Sandstrom banged out
a bases-loaded double in the six run second, while Holzman con
tributed a single and double to the cause.
With two consecutive victories under their belts, including
yesterday's 9-5 triumph over Sequoia High, Stanford's freshmen
baseballers appear ready to jell into a tough, well-rounded ball
club.
The frosh scored their runs in batches yesterday, tallying six in

the second and three more in the
sixth behind three-hit pitching by
Jack Heffelfinger, Dan Feltham, atfd
Ray Young.
Five walks, a single by Bob Evans,
and a bases-loaded double by Marc
Sandstrorn featured the second-in
ning uprising. Singles by Rocky Furst
and Mickey Holzman, a two-base
overthrow, and a balk produced the
"bonus" runs in the sixth.
The squad has been going through
hard, regular workouts since the
spring vacation and, according to
Coach Dick Clegg, the quality of
play has begun to pick up. Pitching
is becoming effective and the hit
ting more solid and consistent.
4 Wins, 3 Losses
As of now the club sports a four
win, three-loss record. The frosh
split four games last quarter when
Dutch Fehring and Clegg were shar
ing the coaching duties. Last week
they bowed narrowly to San Lorenzo
High, 5-4. but bounced back to look
good in blanking El Cerrito, 3-0,
and then Sequoia yesterday.
