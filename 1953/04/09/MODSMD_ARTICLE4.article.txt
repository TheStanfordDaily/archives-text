# Blood Signups Rise To 2,950 Pledges
## 
### 
Signups for the g'ant spring quarter blood drive spiraled higher
yesterday as drive officials reported that 2,950 persons had
pledged either to give blood or to help in the Pavilion during
actual collection next week.
Kappa Alpha, Phi Sig, Theta Chi, and Durand houses reported

yesterday that 100 per cent of their - *
residents had signed to participate
in some phase of the drive, thus
joining Guthrie and Phi Psi, which
attained the 100 per cent figure
Tuesday.
Signups continue today and to
morrow and donations start Mon-

day. Next week the Red Cross will
turn the Pavilion into a mammoth
72-bed collection center. Close to
140 workers will be on duty at all
times—and 25 of them will be stu
dents.
The Blood Drive Committee has
asked persons who are physically

unable to give blood to work on the
drive. Personnel Chairman Lor
raine Wilbur explains that work
ers are badly needed in the Pavil
ion during the noon hour. Workers
can sign up with their living group
representative or call the Blood
Drive office —DA 3-8096 or DA
3-7712.
The results of living group
signups are being recorded on
posters outside the Cellar. A per
son who is physically disqualified
counts for the house only if he is
signed up to work.
All workers will be notified of
their hours by card.
Living group representatives are
continuing to sign up donors. Each
representative is also asked to turn
in parents' permission cards with
the donors' names.
Giving blood will take about an
hour. Signups can be taken every
15 minutes from 8:30 to 5, Mon
day through Friday, next week—
except for Wednesday when the
Pavilion will be open from II to
7 for the benefit of persons who
work during the day.
The Health Service has called off
•vaccinations for this week, and Dr.
Houck explains that anyone who
takes one next week should do it
after he has given blood.
Blood drive officials reported that
the following hours arc closed to
donations:
Monday — 8:30, 9, 10, 11, 11:15,
11:30, 12, 2:15, 12:30, 1, 4.

turn the Pavilion into a mammoth
72-bed collection center. Close to
140 workers will be on duty at all
times—and 25 of them will be stu
dents.
The Blood Drive Committee has
asked persons who are physically

unable to give blood to work on the
drive. Personnel Chairman Lor
raine Wilbur explains that work
ers are badly needed in the Pavil
ion during the noon hour. Workers
can sign up with their living group
representative or call the Blood
Drive office —DA 3-8096 or DA
3-7712.
The results of living group
signups are being recorded on
posters outside the Cellar. A per
son who is physically disqualified
counts for the house only if he is
signed up to work.
All workers will be notified of
their hours by card.
Living group representatives are
continuing to sign up donors. Each
representative is also asked to turn
in parents' permission cards with
the donors' names.
Giving blood will take about an
hour. Signups can be taken every
15 minutes from 8:30 to 5, Mon
day through Friday, next week—
except for Wednesday when the
Pavilion will be open from II to

The Health Service has called off
•vaccinations for this week, and Dr.

takes one next week should do it
after he has given blood.
