# Bob to Jump; Troy Injured
## 
### 
Announcement that Bob Mathias
will compete in a fifth event—the
high jump—and injuries to two top
USC trackmen highlighted the mid
week preparations for Saturday's
Stanford-Trojan meet.
Coach Jack Weiershauser said
that Mathias will go in the high
jump in an effort to capture a first
place from a top USC trio, adding
that "many Trojan jumpers, good
ones, fail in the Stanford pit." Ma
thias has a 6-2% best over the hiyh
bar, but has not competed in the
event this season.
Meanwhile, from the Southland,
injuries to two Trojans and possible
loss of a third faced Troy Coach
Jess Mortensen yesterday.
Pole vaulter Dick Hecht, a 13-4
man, sprained his ankle and will be
kept from practice the rest of the
week. Sprinter Joe Graffio, who
has done a 9.8 100, spiked his hand
in a practice javelin throw and
ripped a gash requiring three or
four stitches. He will compete Sat
urday with a heavy bandage.
