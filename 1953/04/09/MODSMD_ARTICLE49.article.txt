# Con Home Tours Bring Friendship
## 
### JACK FRASER RUBY BERNSTEIN 
It's not the amount of money we give, but the friendships we
make. •
With this idea in mind a pilot crew of thirty students who will
run the May 4 to 8 Con Home Drive visited the home yesterday
and came away with the picture of a well-cared-for and happy

throng of kids.
We saw a barber's chair where
moppets can have their hair trim
med, and another chair which the
kids don't like as well—a dentist's
chair.
Wc saw bean bags, model air
planes, liny tables and chairs,
and art more modern than Picasso
would ever dare to create.
We saw a sunny room filled with
happy animals—monkeys that re
sembled in exuberance the Alpha
Delt band, and a contented penguin
that knew that it should wait its
turn at the table, a reminder to
impatient kids. This was the sunny
homelike room where the "run
abouts," the kids who are able to be
up, eat their meals.
We saw the broad terraces where
beds can be rolled out so that sickly
kids can get their share of sunshine
and well-trimmed lawns to frolic on
trimmed by freshmen paying their
debts to Men's Council.
We saw all this and we saw the
kids for whom these things were
created. And wc heard their
voices — 80 strong — filling the
rooms with youthful enthusiasm.
Other students may share this ex
perience as the Con Home Commit

tee — for the first time since the
drive was started—this spring will
sponsor semi-weekly tours to the
Home. The tours will begin this
Tuesday and will continue every
Tuesday and Friday until the drive.
At least two persons from every
living group will be encouraged to
attend, so that students at large will
understand the purposes and oper
ations of Stanford's first charity.
"We stress the personal touch—
birthdays, toys, many things
found in any normal happy home
—and that's why we want Stan
ford students to come out and go
through the Home," said Nurse
June Bengtson, supervisor, who
led the tour.
A pause in a busy spring after
noon by a Stanford student may
start a friendship which will last
into the years. And friendships are
what the Con Home is built on.

rough and Cardinals co-chairman for Con Home Week, gives an

would ever dare to create.
We saw a sunny room filled with
happy animals—monkeys that re
sembled in exuberance the Alpha
Delt band, and a contented penguin
that knew that it should wait its
turn at the table, a reminder to
impatient kids. This was the sunny
homelike room where the "run
abouts," the kids who are able to be
up, eat their meals.
We saw the broad terraces where
beds can be rolled out so that sickly
kids can get their share of sunshine
and well-trimmed lawns to frolic on
trimmed by freshmen paying their
debts to Men's Council.
We saw all this and we saw the
kids for whom these things were
created. And wc heard their
voices — 80 strong — filling the
rooms with youthful enthusiasm.

tee — for the first time since the
drive was started—this spring will
sponsor semi-weekly tours to the
Home. The tours will begin this
Tuesday and will continue every
Tuesday and Friday until the drive.
At least two persons from every
living group will be encouraged to
attend, so that students at large will
understand the purposes and oper
ations of Stanford's first charity.
"We stress the personal touch—
birthdays, toys, many things
found in any normal happy home
—and that's why we want Stan
ford students to come out and go
through the Home," said Nurse
June Bengtson, supervisor, who
led the tour.
A pause in a busy spring after
noon by a Stanford student may
start a friendship which will last
into the years. And friendships are
what the Con Home is built on.

It's not the amount of money we give, but the friendships we
make. •
With this idea in mind a pilot crew of thirty students who will
run the May 4 to 8 Con Home Drive visited the home yesterday
and came away with the picture of a well-cared-for and happy

throng of kids.
We saw a barber's chair where
moppets can have their hair trim
med, and another chair which the
kids don't like as well—a dentist's
chair.
Wc saw bean bags, model air
planes, liny tables and chairs,
and art more modern than Picasso
would ever dare to create.
