I however, lie realized that while Being En
gaged, before graduation, was one tiling,
| Being Engaged (A.1).) (after ili|Joma) in
volved such complications as Getting Married
and Supporting Dependents. In a "word, Work.
So he began sending job letters to Per
sonnel Directors of I.arge Corporations, out
lining his qualifications. Some answered,
sending him Application Forms to lilt out.
.Siune didn't. Kventually he wound up with
a grim Common Denominator: they would let
him know If Anything Came up.
Disenchanted but Willing, he outlined the
problem to his Betrothed, a girl of Superior
Intelligence. She regarded him sternly. "No
wonder," sho said, "letters, yet! Listen," and
she unfurled a Stratagem.
First thing next morning, he jetted down
to the Westeri^ Union office, in one hand a
j list of tin 10 companies he'd most like to work
I for. and in the other a compelling message
making clear that here was The Man. await
ing only the opportunity to Prove It. Sent it
as a Telegram to all 10 companies.
Results? Within a week he had 6 Inter
views, 4 Job Offers. Today, when he brags
about being a Self-Made Man, his wife just
Smiles Indulgently.
When you're jockeying for a job, use
Telegrams to Get the Jump on the Competi
tion. Telegrams get In, get Read, get the
Reaction you want. Wonder-workers in other
ventures, too . . . whether you're Dickering
for a Date, a Hotel Reservation, or Pesos
from Pop. Just call Western Union.
