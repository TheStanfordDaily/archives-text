# Truckmen Out to Break 20-Year Troy Whitewash
## Four Olympic Champions to Compete In Top Dual Meet Attraction in Nation 
### MIKE HUDSON Sports Editor, The Daily 
Beat Troy! Stanford's trackmen have been trying to do it since 1933, and tomorrow they'll try
again in Stanford Stadium. Field events start at 1:30, and the track events at 2 p.m. Admission
is 50 cents.
USC is as powerful as ever. They have two Olympic champs, the world's greatest hurdler, and
the fastest college quarter-miler in America.
Is there then any difference between this USC meet and those of recent years when a good
Card team was slaughtered by a brilliant Trojan squad?
Card Coach Jack Weiershauser says there is. For this year it is the Indians who have the depth

while the Trojans' hopes rest on
the shoulders of a few track greats.
At long last the pressure is on
the USC men, not the Indians, to
come through.
Consider the broad jump. Cards
Pete McKay and Jim Seebold have
to jump only their normal 22 feet
plus to take two-three, but Verl
Sorgen has to match his season's
best to take first. He'll have to be
way up to take the first that the
dopesters have all conceded him.
USC's highly touted crew of high
jumpers have all hit 6 ft. 3 in. and
6 ft. 4 in., but they have all dropped
out at 5 ft. 11 in. on occasions, and
they usually fold at Stanford. With
Bob Mathias good for about 6 ft. 2
in., Stanford could very well grab
a few of USC's "sure eight or nine"
in the high jump.
Similarly, Jack Davis would
normally be .favored to take Ma
thias by three yards in the low
hurdles, but Weiershauser ques
tions whether Davis will he able
to run the 220 into the Stadium
wind and then come hack 15 min
utes later and heat big Bob.
Furthermore, USC's ace pole
vaulter, Dick Hecht, is rumored to
have sprained his ankle.
With Hecht out, the pole vault
would become a come-through bat
tle between four mediocre pole
vau Iters.
Bob Simon should open the
running events by winning the
mile in slow time. Simon will be
saving all he can to run the two
mile later on. The real battle
here will he for second between
Troy's George Root and Stanford's
Bob Reed and/or Russ Ferguson.
Next USC's Jim Lea should win
the 440, with again a dog-fight for
second between five 49 - second
quarter-milers.
The next event, the 100, will bo
one of the day's crucials. Weiers
hauser feels that Maury Parsons
and Keith Brownsberger can edge
USC's Sorgen, an injured Joe Graf
fio, and Ron Childs.
Weiershauser feels that the 10 flat
that the Card sprinters have run
on a dead track into the wind is
worth more than the Trojan speed
sters' 9.8 or 9.9 centuries on the
fast Coliseum track.
The high hurdles shapes up as
the premier race of the day. En
tered will he the men who took
first, second, and fifth in last
year's nationalsr, plus Stanford's
Jerry Wood, injured last year
but considered by his coach as a
"coming star."
It is probably the greatest field
ever entered in a dual meet high
hurdle competition.
No one has satisfactorily explained
how a 205-pound shot-putter even
has enough nerve to get on the
same track with the world's best
high-hurdler, but when the shot
putter's name is Mathias, miracles
can happen.
Weiershauser again points out
that Mathias' :14.5 into the wind
is as fast as Davis' :14 0 and
Willard Wright's :14.2 on the fast
Coliseum track.
In the 880, the pressure will again
be on the Trojans to produce a man
who can score against Stanford's
1:58 half-milers. So far Troy has
shown nothing in the 880, and they
will probably field a miscellaneous
group of 440 men and milers to
morrow.
The 220 will be another crucial
race. The puffing Parsons and the
fast-finishing Brownsberger will be
racing a tired but great Lea and
Davis.
In the two-mile, Stanford fig
ures to take six or eight points,
hut about everyone in the race
will have competed in the mile
