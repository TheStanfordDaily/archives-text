# Orchesis Dance Presentation Rated 'Well Worth Seeing'
## 
### MARY FRAZER Daily Feature Editor 
One of the year's most varied and scintillating concert programs
was given last night and will be presented again tonight at 8:15
in Mem Aud — the Orchesis Spring Dance Program.
The members and apprentices of Stanford's modern dance
club have combined rare expressive talent, some outstanding

dancing ability, and simple, but ef
fective costuming to present an eve
ning of rare interest.
The program is not evenly excel
lent; several numbers arc over-long,
others miss the point. Yet on th'e
whole the concert is excellent and
well worth seeing.
Judy Dickinson's "Jumping Bean"
is marked by quickness, humor, and
sustained excellence. And her "Por
trait of a Lady," sprightly and pre
cise, appeared to be the show's best
offering. Sharing equal honors is
Margaret Duggar's "Morning Song,"
according to audience reaction.
"Road to Olepanti," a dance drama
based on a California Indian death
legend, began with unusual lighting
and drum effects, but became fairly

confusing as it progressed.
"A La Vogue," another quick and
sprightly number, by Pat Fortine,
was well done. The vivacity and hu
mor of this number were outstand
ing.
The precision work of Orchesis is
a trifle imprecise at times, but the
excellence of individual dancers, the
presence of at least two outstanding
numbers for each not-so-good one,
are the ingredients of a successful
theater evening.
Orchesis president Sally Halbert,.
Faculty Advisor Margaret Duggar,
and the dance club as a whole, are to
be congratulated for the outstanding
variety and general excellence of the
concert.
