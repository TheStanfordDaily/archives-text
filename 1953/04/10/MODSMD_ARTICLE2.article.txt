# BLOOD DRIVE HITS SLUMP
## Fourth Day of Sign-ups Nets Only 300 Donors 
### DOROTHY DODGE Editorial Assistant, The Daily 
The once-exuberant blood drive took a dismal drop yesterday
as only 300 more donors were solicited in the fourth day of sign
ups. The total sign-ups now number 3,286 —only half the number
needed to insure Stanford its 5,000-pint goal.
"The drive is dying," chairman Ken Schechter commented sadly

last night when the day's sign-ups
had been totaled.
Monday, Wednesday, Thursday,
and Friday are days having the most
vacancies for donation appointments.
The timing of the drive may
turn out to be unusually good if
the exchange of sick and wounded
prisoners being negotiated in Kor
ea goes through next week. The
Red Cross has already been calling
for the type "O" that is shipped
overseas as whole blood, and if the
prisoners are exchanged the need
will be extra great.
Sign-ups to give blood will con
tinue over the weekend and until
the drive is over. Donations start
Monday and end Friday.
At a cost of more than $2,000, the
Palo Alto Red Cross chapter is
throwing its full resources behind
the drive. The Pavilion will be trans
formed into a mammouth 72-bed do
nation center for the duration of the
drive.
Activities in the whole four-county
area served by the Blood Collection
Center in San Jose will be closed
down for the week to make the nec
essary equipment available. Close to
140 workers—students, professional
Red Cross workers, and Palo Alto
Red Cross volunteers—will be on
duty in the Pavilion.
Next Tuesday one shipment of
type "O" whole blood will be flown
by u °licoptcr from Stanford to
IVlofTctt Field for transfer to a
military transport plane headed
for Korea. The helicopter will leave
the soccer field near the Pavilion
at 11 Tuesday morning.
Donors will still be able to sign up
with living group representatives for
the coursc of the drive. Results can
be brought in to the Blood Drive to
day between noon and 2 p.m., to
morrow between 11 a.m., and Sun
day from 4 p.m. on. Next week the
office wil be open to report sign-ups
from 5:15 to 8 p.m. Representatives
can also phone DA 3-7712 or DA 3-
8006.
Charts outside the Cellar indi
cate how the living group sign-ups
compare percentage-wise. A house
can get 100 per cent if Ml the per
sons who arc physically disqualified
from giving arc sipped up to work.
Workers are especu ly needed in the
Pavilion during noon hours.
Starting Monday, the white re
cords of persons signed up will
be painted over in red to show how
many people have actually given.
Giving blood takes about an hour.
The collection center will be open
from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day
except Wednesday, when the hours
are 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Donors shoulfl plan not to eat any
thing but dry toast, fruit juice, and
coffee for four hours before giving.
This is because fat in the blood
stream makes the blood unusable
and giving after eating means a
total waste from both the point ot
view of the donor and the Red Cross.

day between noon and 2 p.m., to
morrow between 11 a.m., and Sun
day from 4 p.m. on. Next week the
office wil be open to report sign-ups
from 5:15 to 8 p.m. Representatives
can also phone DA 3-7712 or DA 3-
8006.
Charts outside the Cellar indi
cate how the living group sign-ups
compare percentage-wise. A house
can get 100 per cent if Ml the per
sons who arc physically disqualified
from giving arc sipped up to work.
Workers are especu ly needed in the
Pavilion during noon hours.
Starting Monday, the white re
cords of persons signed up will
be painted over in red to show how
many people have actually given.
Giving blood takes about an hour.
The collection center will be open
from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day
except Wednesday, when the hours
are 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Donors shoulfl plan not to eat any
thing but dry toast, fruit juice, and
coffee for four hours before giving.
This is because fat in the blood
stream makes the blood unusable
and giving after eating means a
total waste from both the point ot
view of the donor and the Red Cross.
The once-exuberant blood drive took a dismal drop yesterday
as only 300 more donors were solicited in the fourth day of sign
ups. The total sign-ups now number 3,286 —only half the number
needed to insure Stanford its 5,000-pint goal.
"The drive is dying," chairman Ken Schechter commented sadly

last night when the day's sign-ups
had been totaled.
Monday, Wednesday, Thursday,
and Friday are days having the most
vacancies for donation appointments.
The timing of the drive may
turn out to be unusually good if
the exchange of sick and wounded
prisoners being negotiated in Kor
ea goes through next week. The
Red Cross has already been calling
for the type "O" that is shipped
overseas as whole blood, and if the
prisoners are exchanged the need
will be extra great.
Sign-ups to give blood will con
tinue over the weekend and until
the drive is over. Donations start
Monday and end Friday.
At a cost of more than $2,000, the
Palo Alto Red Cross chapter is
throwing its full resources behind
the drive. The Pavilion will be trans
formed into a mammouth 72-bed do
nation center for the duration of the
drive.
Activities in the whole four-county
area served by the Blood Collection
Center in San Jose will be closed
down for the week to make the nec
essary equipment available. Close to
140 workers—students, professional
Red Cross workers, and Palo Alto
Red Cross volunteers—will be on
duty in the Pavilion.
Next Tuesday one shipment of
type "O" whole blood will be flown
by u °licoptcr from Stanford to
IVlofTctt Field for transfer to a
military transport plane headed
for Korea. The helicopter will leave
the soccer field near the Pavilion
at 11 Tuesday morning.
Donors will still be able to sign up
with living group representatives for
the coursc of the drive. Results can
be brought in to the Blood Drive to
day between noon and 2 p.m., to
morrow between 11 a.m., and Sun
day from 4 p.m. on. Next week the
