# Remodeling Speech Activities
## 
### 
The second in a sprinkling of seemingly radi
cal reorganizations that are hitting ASSU
groups this year was accomplished Wednes
day night, when Excom approved the paper
structure changing the Debate Board into the
Speech Activities Board.
The move follows on the heels of Activities
Board, which last quarter dissolved itself and
moved for the establishment of. Social Coordi
nating Board.
Debate Board had degenerated over the past
few years until its functions consisted of little
more than trying to pump life into Stanford's
atrophied interest in intercollegiate debating
and forensic competition.
Starting last September, however, Dave
Jacobson took over as Debate Manager, and
things began to perk up.
Debate Board has attempted to broaden the
scope of its activities by reintroducing intra
mural speaking, promoting discussion meet
ings and radio programs.
But Jacobsen and Anthony Hillbruner, in

structor in speech and drama and faculty ad
visor for the Board, realized that the former
structure of the Debate Board was inadequate
to handle its attempts to increase its activities.
Ergo, they sat down to rewrite the By-Laws of
ASSU pertaining to speech activities and also
to establish a set of by-laws for a Speech As
sociation.
As Excom approved the new by-laws, they
provide for a Speech Activities Board to have
general control over all forensic matters.
Under the Board, there will be three major
committees, those for debate, discusion, and
intra-mural and other subordinate groups, all
of which will be components of the overall
student group, the Speech Association.
We think the new structure is adequate, and
we applaud the efforts of Jacobsen, Hillbruner,
and others connected with the reorganization.
Their task now is to translate the paper struc
ture into tangible accomplishments in promot
ing a general interest in speaking activities on
the campus.
