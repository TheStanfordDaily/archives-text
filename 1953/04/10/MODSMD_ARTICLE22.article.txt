# CAMPUS OPINION
## Are We Going to Take a Stand? 
### 
To the Editor:
What's the matter with us? Students on this campus
seem to be doing little talking and thinking about
the problem of congressional investigations and our
professors. Are we ill-informed or are we cowards?
Have we no opinions or are we afraid to express the
ones we have?
There are a thousand and one questions we should
be asking ourselves.
Who do we think Is qualified to say whether or not
a professor is competent to teach? The'state or na
tional legislatures or one of their committees? Or the
university's faculty and administration?
On what grounds should this judgment be made?
The professor's past or present political affiliations and
associations? Or his grasp of his subject and his
ability to impart it to his students? Do we agree with
Taft that Communists should be allowed to teach sub
jects like math and astronomy, where there is no
party line? Should they teach economics and political
science? Or are they unqualified to teach any subject?
When should the legislature move in and investi
gate professors? Never? Or when there is a 'clear
and present danger' that the university is being mis
run? Does such a danger exist now?
Are the men who are conducting these particular
investigations qualified to judge our professors? Are
their methods fair, or are the charges of 'smear tactics,'

'guilt by association,' and 'trial by committee' justi
fied? Are the investigators ferreting out Communists,
or are the Communists going free while non-conform
ing liberals are being persecuted? Should we leave
the problem of unearthing subversives to the FBI?
Are the universities themselves responsible for the
current public feelings of unease? Do we need a long
term program of public education before we can regain j
the public's trust?
Maybe we can't know the answers to all of these i
questions. But certainly we should be thinking about
them and discussing them. Perhaps we really favor
these investigations. Perhaps we suspect that Com
munists have infiltrated our universities and that we
need the legislature to ferret them out for us.
Or maybe since the bloodhounds aren't at Stanford's
heels, we don't want to bother thinking about it. Is
this the kind of citizens we are going to be after we
graduate?
The investigations were announced four months ago.
Is it time for us to take some stand on the issues in
volved?

What's the matter with us? Students on this campus
seem to be doing little talking and thinking about
the problem of congressional investigations and our
professors. Are we ill-informed or are we cowards?
Have we no opinions or are we afraid to express the
ones we have?
There are a thousand and one questions we should
be asking ourselves.
Who do we think Is qualified to say whether or not
a professor is competent to teach? The'state or na
tional legislatures or one of their committees? Or the
university's faculty and administration?
On what grounds should this judgment be made?
The professor's past or present political affiliations and
associations? Or his grasp of his subject and his
ability to impart it to his students? Do we agree with
Taft that Communists should be allowed to teach sub
jects like math and astronomy, where there is no
party line? Should they teach economics and political
science? Or are they unqualified to teach any subject?
When should the legislature move in and investi
gate professors? Never? Or when there is a 'clear
and present danger' that the university is being mis
run? Does such a danger exist now?
Are the men who are conducting these particular
investigations qualified to judge our professors? Are
their methods fair, or are the charges of 'smear tactics,'

'guilt by association,' and 'trial by committee' justi
fied? Are the investigators ferreting out Communists,
or are the Communists going free while non-conform
ing liberals are being persecuted? Should we leave
the problem of unearthing subversives to the FBI?
Are the universities themselves responsible for the
current public feelings of unease? Do we need a long
term program of public education before we can regain j
the public's trust?
Maybe we can't know the answers to all of these i
questions. But certainly we should be thinking about
them and discussing them. Perhaps we really favor
these investigations. Perhaps we suspect that Com
munists have infiltrated our universities and that we
need the legislature to ferret them out for us.
Or maybe since the bloodhounds aren't at Stanford's
heels, we don't want to bother thinking about it. Is
this the kind of citizens we are going to be after we
graduate?
The investigations were announced four months ago.
Is it time for us to take some stand on the issues in
volved?
