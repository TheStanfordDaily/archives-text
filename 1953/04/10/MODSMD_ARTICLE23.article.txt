# Ex-Nurse Cites Hospital Ship Cases To Emphasize Need for Whole Blood

### DOROTHY DODGE Editorial Assistant, The Daily 
nothing more dis
tressing to a nurse or a doctor
than to know that a patient needs
blood and not to have any," re
calls former Navy Nurse Grayce
Leidig, now a Stanford graduate
student in education.
Miss Leidig was an operating
room supervisor on the hospital ship
Emily HM Wicder during World
War 11. The ship took part in most
of the major invasions in both the
European and Pacific theaters.
A hospital ship's job was to fol
low convoys and put hospital units
ashore. The wounded from the in
vasion would then be loaded back
on the ship.
Booms would lift the wounded

aboard and doctors would check
them immediately. Men suffering
from shock would be sent to the
shock room before surgery — at
tached to their blankets would be
tags indicating thefr need for blood
or plasma.
"And when you needed blood,
you needed blood." Miss Leidig
remembers. She explains I bat
plasma would not replace a severe
loss of blood—that in many cases
there was no replacement for
whole blood.
Many times the hospital ship's
crew gave blood themselves when
the need was desperate and the
stock ran out. "They gave willing
ly," the nurse recalls, "though they
were working long and hard them
selves."
Miss Leidig saw hundreds of lives
saved by blood. She tells of one
cayj' —a 24-vear-old second lieu

tenant who had just received his
field commission. He was severely
injured in a land mine explosion in
the landings at Leyte.
The lieutenant was brought
aboard the ship bleeding to death,
suffering from severe shock. He
was in such bad shape they
couldn't operate. They could only
give him transfusions—four pints
of blood and two units of plasma
in the first eight hours.
The next morning he needed sur
gery desperately. They gave him
more blood—a U)ta*l of 12 pints of
whole blood in 72 hours. Eventu-*
ally he recovered. A week later
they evacuated him and his condi
tion was considered good.
Miss Leidig is enthusiastic about
the current 5,000-pint drive. She is
physically unable to give blood
herself, but she plans to work at
the Pavilion next week.
