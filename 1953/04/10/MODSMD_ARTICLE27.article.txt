# Viewpoint Plans Financial Appeal
## 
### 
Viewpoint will make a financial
appeal to Stanford alumni to keep
the publication going, Editor Tom
Johnson announced at a staff meet
ing last night.
Johnson admitted that student
response to the literary magazine
was discouraging. "However," he
affirmed, "we still feel that such a
magazine is needed on campus."
The next issue of Viewpoint may
come out either late in May or next
September, depending on the suc
cess of the financial appeal.
