## 
### 
Stanford's frosh track team, po
tentially the best in the school's
history, meets City College of San
Francisco and Contra Costa West
tomorrow at 10 a.m. on the Angell
Field oval in quest of their second
win of the season.
Coach Kay Dean announced two
changes for tomorrow. Jim Tru
her may not be entered in the
discus, leaving him the 100, 220,
and the shot put—the three events
he won last weekend.
Bill Rupp will run the 440 and
the relay, his best high school
events, instead of the 100 and 220.

frosh more depth in the event.

his mark of 23.8 in the lows which
gave him a new school record last
weekend. It was the first time he
