Stanford's rugby team came from
behind to edge a visiting College of
Pacific squad Wednesday afternoon
on the local field, 11 to 10.
Behind 10 to 6 with only a few
minutes left to play, Stanford was
awarded a penalty kick close to the
Tiger goal. Sam Morley lined up
for the kick, but booted the ball
onsides instead.
From out of the subsequent me
lee, Dorsey Atkinson emerged with
the ball across the line, good for a
try. Atkinson kicked the conver
sion from a difficult angle to score
the deciding two points.
The rest of the Stanford scoring
was done by breakaway Jack Bo
netti, who scored a try on a short
dash, and Atkinson, on a penalty.
COP scorers were wing Don Cor
nell and Tom McCormick. Both
scored on tries.
