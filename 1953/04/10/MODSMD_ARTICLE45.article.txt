# Alpine Club Plans Spring Climbs, Yosemite Weekend
## 
### JANE LINDEMUTH 
Pitons, karobiners, slings, and ropes mean spring fun to the
Stanford Alpine Club's 50 members. Those for whom such terms
spell "confusion" are invited to participate in this Sunday's prac
tice climb at Hunter's Hill. Members will meet at 10:30 a.m. at
History corner. Beginners are welcome. Instructors will be mem
bers who "know the ropes." ♦

Two Yosemite Valley weekend
climbs for qualified members dur
ing spring quarter are being plan
ned. Officers of the Alpiners are
Rowland Tabor, president; Jack
Maling, vice - president; Nancy
Bickford, secretary; Jane Noble,
treasurer; and George Mowat,
equipment chairman.
There are three classes of mem
bers in the club — non - qualified,
qualified, and leader. To qualify,
members must attend three prac
tice climbs and demonstrate, at the
end of that time, an ability to climb
and to handle ropes.
Sunday practice climbs enable
beginners to obtain training for

the Yosemite climbs. Less expe
rienced members are instructed
by the veterans.
Here's how the seven-year-old
club started. In the summer of 1946,
Larry Taylor and Fritz Lippman
met in the Sierra Club Rock Climb
ing Section. They discussed the
idea of forming at Stanford a group
similar to the Sierra Club RCS. One
day that fall, in front of the Stan
ford Bookstore, Taylor met A 1 Bax
ter carrying a pair of climbing
boots. It was love at first sight;
Taylor and Baxter decided to form
a climbing club. An enthusiastic
membership was enlisted from the
Ski Club and the moribund Hiking
Club. Baxter suggested the name
"Stanford Alpine Club"and Tay
lor designed a club pin. The club
soon obtained a charter from ASSU.
Baxter later climbed the Alps
and is now chairman of the Cali
fornia Himalayan Expedition. He
joined member Jon Lindbergh
and graduate Bud Gates in the
summer of 1!)52 to climb in Alas
ka—naming one mountain peak
for Stanford's first president, Da
vid Starr Jordan.
Other club members going "on to
greater heights" include Dave Har
rah, '51, who scaled Ycrupaja in the
Peruvian Andes. While in Alaska
with a geological survey party,
president Tabor and Karl Stauffer
made a first ascent or Mt. La Pe
ruse.
Fall and winter quarter activi
ties, 1952-53, included climbs in
Yosemite Valley, Tuolumne
Meadows, Castle Crags, the Pin
nacles, and ski-touring trips to
OstrandcT Lake, Tuolumne Mead
ows, - and Mt. Shasta. Practice
climb sites are Miraloma Park,
Cragmont, Indian, Skyline, Hun
ter's Hill, and Lovers' Leap.
Ranging from easy, half - day
hikes to difficult rock-climbing in
volving use of ropes and pitons,
club activities are planned for all

members, from non - qualified
through leader classes. Summer
climbs include group trips in the
Tetons and the Canadian Rockies.
Alpiners meet every weekday in
the Union Court (or, if it's raining,
in the Nitery) from 12:30 to 1:15
p.m. for discussion of climbing,
business meetings, and for planing
of such events as the Bergsteigers'
Ball.

members must attend three prac
tice climbs and demonstrate, at the
end of that time, an ability to climb
and to handle ropes.
Sunday practice climbs enable
beginners to obtain training for

the Yosemite climbs. Less expe
rienced members are instructed
by the veterans.
Here's how the seven-year-old
club started. In the summer of 1946,
Larry Taylor and Fritz Lippman
met in the Sierra Club Rock Climb
ing Section. They discussed the
idea of forming at Stanford a group
similar to the Sierra Club RCS. One
day that fall, in front of the Stan
ford Bookstore, Taylor met A 1 Bax
ter carrying a pair of climbing
boots. It was love at first sight;
Taylor and Baxter decided to form
a climbing club. An enthusiastic
membership was enlisted from the
Ski Club and the moribund Hiking
Club. Baxter suggested the name
"Stanford Alpine Club"and Tay
lor designed a club pin. The club
soon obtained a charter from ASSU.
Baxter later climbed the Alps
and is now chairman of the Cali
fornia Himalayan Expedition. He
joined member Jon Lindbergh
and graduate Bud Gates in the
summer of 1!)52 to climb in Alas
ka—naming one mountain peak
for Stanford's first president, Da
vid Starr Jordan.
Other club members going "on to
greater heights" include Dave Har
rah, '51, who scaled Ycrupaja in the
Peruvian Andes. While in Alaska
with a geological survey party,
president Tabor and Karl Stauffer
made a first ascent or Mt. La Pe
ruse.
Fall and winter quarter activi
ties, 1952-53, included climbs in
Yosemite Valley, Tuolumne
Meadows, Castle Crags, the Pin
nacles, and ski-touring trips to
OstrandcT Lake, Tuolumne Mead
ows, - and Mt. Shasta. Practice
climb sites are Miraloma Park,
Cragmont, Indian, Skyline, Hun
ter's Hill, and Lovers' Leap.
Ranging from easy, half - day
hikes to difficult rock-climbing in
volving use of ropes and pitons,
club activities are planned for all

members, from non - qualified
through leader classes. Summer
climbs include group trips in the
Tetons and the Canadian Rockies.
Alpiners meet every weekday in
the Union Court (or, if it's raining,
in the Nitery) from 12:30 to 1:15
p.m. for discussion of climbing,
business meetings, and for planing
of such events as the Bergsteigers'
Ball.
