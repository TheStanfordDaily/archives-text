# STANFORD—TODAY AND TOMORROW
## Next Two Years 'Tightest' For University Finances 
### WIN GRIFFITH 
(Ed. Note—This is the first in
a scries of "Stanford — Today
and Tomorrow" articles which
will appear in The Daily dur
ing the next five weeks of the
current student information
program. The articles will dis
cuss University finances, build
ings and land development, and
academics).
The Stanford of today faces
a tomorrow of improvement,
expansion, and development.
It also faces the prospect of
a tomorrow in which the fi
nancial statements of the Uni
versity may be written in red,
a tomorrow which administa
tion leaders say wjll be the
"financially tightest two years
in the history of the Univer
sity."
It is this "tight situation" which
in one way or another affects
every aspect of the University's
plans for the future. Every per
son associated with the adminis
tration, from President Sterling
to the temporary instructor in
English A, has been made aware
of what the General Secretary's
office describes as a "dangerous
pattern," a pattern of deficit budg
eting.
This patern which is of such
great concern to University lead
ers includes:
1. A budget for the year 1051
to 1952 which designated a defi
cit later made up by reserve
funds.
2. A budget for the current
year, Sept. 1052 to Sept. 1953,
which includes a deficit of close

to $600,000. Most of the deficit
will be made up by unexpect
ed Rifts to the University and
"budget savings," but at best the
University will "go even" at
the end of the year.
3. A budget for the year 1953
to 1954 (approved by the Board of
Trustees last month) with a defi
cit of $782,000, the highest defi
cit under which the University
has ever operated. Much of that
amount will again be made up by
unexpected gifts and further
budget savings, but the General
Secretary's office says that indi
cations are that "the high deficit
will not be erased during the year,
that the University will be, in
September of 1954, in the red."
4. The situation in the year
1954 to 1955 will be equally diffi
cult, with further indications that
the University will still be in the
red at the end of that year.
Why the pattern of deficit budg
eting in a school which .stands
14th in the nation for its total en
dowment?
Primarily, the tendency has
been a problem of enrollment.
Administration leaders place
emphasis on the combination of
the draft, a "low college age
population," and the competi
tion of eastern colleges. An in
creased enrollment, the admin
istration believes, will reducc
the overall financial stress that
Stanford faces today.
During the next few years, the
"college age population" will be
lower than it has been in many
years, the result of a low birth
rate during the depression. With
an expected high number of col
lege age students by 1960, the re
sult of the first crop of "war
babies," the problem of enrolling
enough students to meet the ex
penses of the University will be

removed.
Stanford also faces the same
problem that has been present
ever since the University began
to expand after the last world
war—the problem of housing. The
enrollment cannot be increased
until Stanford has enough facili
ties to house its students. The
recently announced plans for con
struction of several large - size
living residences designated suf
ficient housing for an increased
enrollment by 1955.
It is thus in reference to the
building program and the expect
ed increase of college age popu
lation that administration leaders
say that after the next two years,
the dangerous financial pattern
will end. At that time Stanford
will be able to climb out of the
red and back into its former se
cure position.
For the present, the Univer
sity is willing to wait. It does
not intend to take any of the
several easy ways out of finan
cial stress. Its announced policy
is that it will NOT reducc the
high academic standards for
admission, that it will NOT dis
continue its extensive and ex
pensive scholarship program
and admit only those students
who can pay their own way,
and that it will not cut down
a faculty which is greater in
number than is actually needed.
Administration leaders say that
a temporary secure financial po
sition is not worth lowering those
academic standards for admission,
creating an unbalanced social sit
uation at Stanford by admitting
only those who can sustain them
selves financially, or bi'eaking a
"moral obligation" to retain the
teachers which it added to its
staff at the end of the last war.

dowment?
Primarily, the tendency has
been a problem of enrollment.
Administration leaders place
emphasis on the combination of
the draft, a "low college age
population," and the competi
tion of eastern colleges. An in
creased enrollment, the admin
istration believes, will reducc
the overall financial stress that
Stanford faces today.
During the next few years, the
"college age population" will be
lower than it has been in many
years, the result of a low birth
rate during the depression. With
an expected high number of col
lege age students by 1960, the re
sult of the first crop of "war
babies," the problem of enrolling
enough students to meet the ex
penses of the University will be

removed.
Stanford also faces the same
problem that has been present
ever since the University began
to expand after the last world
war—the problem of housing. The
enrollment cannot be increased
until Stanford has enough facili
ties to house its students. The
recently announced plans for con
struction of several large - size
living residences designated suf
ficient housing for an increased
enrollment by 1955.
It is thus in reference to the
building program and the expect
ed increase of college age popu
lation that administration leaders
say that after the next two years,
the dangerous financial pattern
will end. At that time Stanford
will be able to climb out of the
red and back into its former se
cure position.
For the present, the Univer
sity is willing to wait. It does
not intend to take any of the
several easy ways out of finan
cial stress. Its announced policy
is that it will NOT reducc the
high academic standards for
admission, that it will NOT dis
continue its extensive and ex
pensive scholarship program
and admit only those students
who can pay their own way,
and that it will not cut down
a faculty which is greater in
number than is actually needed.
Administration leaders say that
a temporary secure financial po
sition is not worth lowering those
academic standards for admission,
creating an unbalanced social sit
uation at Stanford by admitting
only those who can sustain them
selves financially, or bi'eaking a
"moral obligation" to retain the
teachers which it added to its
staff at the end of the last war.

The Stanford of today faces
a tomorrow of improvement,
expansion, and development.
It also faces the prospect of
a tomorrow in which the fi
nancial statements of the Uni
versity may be written in red,
a tomorrow which administa
tion leaders say wjll be the
"financially tightest two years
in the history of the Univer
sity."
It is this "tight situation" which
in one way or another affects
every aspect of the University's
plans for the future. Every per
son associated with the adminis
tration, from President Sterling
to the temporary instructor in
English A, has been made aware
of what the General Secretary's
office describes as a "dangerous
pattern," a pattern of deficit budg
eting.
This patern which is of such
great concern to University lead
ers includes:
1. A budget for the year 1051
to 1952 which designated a defi
cit later made up by reserve
funds.
2. A budget for the current
year, Sept. 1052 to Sept. 1953,
which includes a deficit of close

to $600,000. Most of the deficit
will be made up by unexpect
ed Rifts to the University and
"budget savings," but at best the
University will "go even" at
the end of the year.
3. A budget for the year 1953
to 1954 (approved by the Board of
Trustees last month) with a defi
cit of $782,000, the highest defi
cit under which the University
has ever operated. Much of that
amount will again be made up by
unexpected gifts and further
budget savings, but the General
Secretary's office says that indi
cations are that "the high deficit
will not be erased during the year,
that the University will be, in
September of 1954, in the red."
4. The situation in the year
1954 to 1955 will be equally diffi
cult, with further indications that
the University will still be in the
red at the end of that year.

a tomorrow of improvement,
expansion, and development.
It also faces the prospect of
a tomorrow in which the fi
nancial statements of the Uni
versity may be written in red,
a tomorrow which administa
tion leaders say wjll be the
"financially tightest two years
in the history of the Univer
sity."
It is this "tight situation" which
in one way or another affects
every aspect of the University's
plans for the future. Every per
son associated with the adminis
tration, from President Sterling
to the temporary instructor in
English A, has been made aware
of what the General Secretary's
office describes as a "dangerous
pattern," a pattern of deficit budg
eting.
This patern which is of such
great concern to University lead
ers includes:
1. A budget for the year 1051
to 1952 which designated a defi
cit later made up by reserve
funds.
2. A budget for the current
year, Sept. 1052 to Sept. 1953,
which includes a deficit of close

to $600,000. Most of the deficit
will be made up by unexpect
ed Rifts to the University and
"budget savings," but at best the
University will "go even" at
the end of the year.
3. A budget for the year 1953
to 1954 (approved by the Board of
Trustees last month) with a defi
cit of $782,000, the highest defi
cit under which the University
has ever operated. Much of that
amount will again be made up by
unexpected gifts and further
budget savings, but the General
Secretary's office says that indi
cations are that "the high deficit
will not be erased during the year,
that the University will be, in
September of 1954, in the red."
4. The situation in the year
1954 to 1955 will be equally diffi
cult, with further indications that
the University will still be in the
red at the end of that year.
Why the pattern of deficit budg
eting in a school which .stands
14th in the nation for its total en
dowment?
Primarily, the tendency has
been a problem of enrollment.
Administration leaders place
emphasis on the combination of
the draft, a "low college age
population," and the competi
tion of eastern colleges. An in
creased enrollment, the admin
istration believes, will reducc
the overall financial stress that
Stanford faces today.
During the next few years, the
"college age population" will be
lower than it has been in many
years, the result of a low birth
rate during the depression. With
an expected high number of col
lege age students by 1960, the re
sult of the first crop of "war
babies," the problem of enrolling
enough students to meet the ex
penses of the University will be

removed.
Stanford also faces the same
problem that has been present
ever since the University began
to expand after the last world
war—the problem of housing. The
enrollment cannot be increased
until Stanford has enough facili
ties to house its students. The
recently announced plans for con
struction of several large - size
living residences designated suf
ficient housing for an increased
enrollment by 1955.
It is thus in reference to the
building program and the expect
ed increase of college age popu
lation that administration leaders
say that after the next two years,
the dangerous financial pattern
will end. At that time Stanford
will be able to climb out of the
red and back into its former se
cure position.
For the present, the Univer
sity is willing to wait. It does
not intend to take any of the
several easy ways out of finan
cial stress. Its announced policy
is that it will NOT reducc the
high academic standards for
admission, that it will NOT dis
continue its extensive and ex
pensive scholarship program
and admit only those students
who can pay their own way,
and that it will not cut down
a faculty which is greater in
number than is actually needed.
Administration leaders say that
a temporary secure financial po
sition is not worth lowering those
academic standards for admission,
creating an unbalanced social sit
uation at Stanford by admitting
only those who can sustain them
selves financially, or bi'eaking a
"moral obligation" to retain the
teachers which it added to its
staff at the end of the last war.
