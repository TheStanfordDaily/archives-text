# A
						Process: Six Steps
## 
### DOROTHY DODGE Editorial Assistant, The Daily 
When you go to the Pavilion to
give blood this week, here's the
process you'll go through:
As you enter the Pavilion, a guide
will show you to the proper alpha
betical registering table. A regis
trar will make out your donor card
and, if you're a minor, will check to
see if your parent's release slip is
in their file.
Next one of five nurses' aides
from the Palo Alto Red Cross chap
ter will take your temperature.
Your medical history and weight
come after that. Ten registered
nurses are in charge here, with a
supervising doctor constantly on
duty. It's here that you'll be dis
qualified if you're physically un
able to give—if, for example, you
weigh less than 110 pounds or if
you've had some disease that elimi
nates you.
Orange juice is the next step—
to increase the liquid in your sys
tem.
Your blood is then typed. If you
have the precious type "O," that can
be given to anyone, you'll be sent
to a special table, for type "O" goes
overseas as whole blood. Other
types are made into plasma or the
serum albumin so often used in Ko
rea to treat shock. Serum albumin
is especially valuable because, un
like plasma, it doesn't freeze.
After that you take a bottle and
go to the donor room. There you'll
find Red Cross registered nurses,
especially trained in blood collect
ing. You'll be given novocain to in
sure that the process doesn't hurt,
and additional nurse's aides will bo
on duty to make sure all goes well.
After your blood and you have
parted company, it is put on a
cart and taken to the loading
room. You are given water to
help increase the liquid in your
system, then assigned to a rest
cot for 10 minutes. A nurse's aide
will write the time on the sole#
of your shoe in white chalk.
That's it. From there you go to
the canteen, where you'll be served
milk or coffee, doughnuts or cinna
mon rolls. On the way out you re
ceive your donor pin — the little
emblem, shaped like a drop of
blood, that means you've helped
save the life of some soldier in Ko
rea.
