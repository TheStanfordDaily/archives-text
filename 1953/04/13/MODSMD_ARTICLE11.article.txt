## Sign Up and Give Blood 
### 
Almost 6,000 people in the Stanford community have not yet
pledged in the drive.
Only 4,191 people have signed up to give blood on I o( at least
6,000 that are needed to insure the goal of 5,000 pnts.
Who are you, the slackers?
Many of you are off-campus students. Only 377 out of approxi
mately 2,000 off-campus students have signed up. This record
of 18 per cent is one of the lowest on record. You haven't been con
tacted? We're contacting you.
The most indifferent single group is the University faculty, staff,
and assistants. Only 211 have signed out of more than 2,250. Even
though you people are mature adults and you fought in the last
two wars, don't you care about your sons who are fighting this
one?
Approximately two-thirds of the on-campus students have
pledged.
"I don't like being pressured," is the answer often received
from you who haven't signed up.
Who do you think you're hurtingâ€”the people who are working
cn the drive, your fellow students who are urging you to give?
No, the only people your refusal hurts are the guys wounded in
Korea and in need of blood.
"Unfortunately, there's some pressure being put on some guys
to be shot at on Bunker Hill," is the way it's put by the chairman of
the drive, an ex-Navy flier himself wounded in Korea.
Talk to some of the veterans of the Korean fighting. Hear them
tell how blood saved their's or their buddies' lives ... or more
impressive yet, hear them tell about the men who died because
there wasn't enough blood.
Do this, then tell us what you could possibly be doing this week
more important than saving a life.
Sign up and give blood.
