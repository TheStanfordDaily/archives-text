# Ho-hum—Troy Tracksters Triumph
## 
### MIKE HUDSON Sports Editor, The Daily 
Stanford look its annual drubbing from USC's track team Sat
urday in the Stadium. The final score was 79 3 /4 to 51'/».
The Cards won all the events they were supposed to, and the
Trojans won all their sure firsts, generally setting a meet record
while they were at it. When the event was considered a toss-up,

then USC always seemed to prevail.
In the 100, probably the crucial
race of the day, all predicted that
the field would hit the tape to
gether with anybody first. But an
unheralded Joe GrafTio, running
with an injured hand, ground out a
beautiful 9.7 century.
Similarly, Jim Lea won the 440
a;> cxpcclcd, but (lie predicted
battle for second failed to mate
rialize as something called Darcl
Griffin easily placed.
The Cards' versatile ace Bob Ma
thias pulled his back on his second
broad jYimp, and was held to two
points for the afternoon.
There were numerous bright
spots in I lie picture for Card ad
herents. Ifowie llertz hit 54 ft.
I'h in. in the shot to beat his pre
vious best by almost a foot, and
rate him among the nation's best.
Nase Fishback cleared 6 ft. 3Vfe in.
in the high jump, which was all that
the highly touted Trojan trio could
Ho, and the resulting four-way tic
i broke the expected Trojan sweep.
Loren Sorenson went over 22
feet in the broad jump. Leo Long
and Bob Kimball bit 299 feet in
the javelin. Bob Heed grabbed a
lirst in the two-mile and a third
in the mile, and Jerry Wood
edged out IJSC's Willard Wright,

fifth in the naton last year, for
second in the high hurdles. All
were coinc-throughs for a losing
cause.
The real show, however, was
watching the Trojan greats in ac
tion.
Parry O'Brien pushed the iron
ball 57 ft. lOV2 in. or about one foot
short of the world mark. Every one
of his efforts surpassed the .55-foot
"mark. O'Brien starts his throw by
facing directly away from where he
is putting. His 180 - degree pivot,
speed across the circle, and strength
provide awe-inspiring results.
Sim Iness, fighting off a queasy
stomach, broke the American rec
ord with a gargantuan 185-ft. 51/4-
in. discus toss. Minnesota's fortune
Gordien set the world mark of 18G
ft. 11 in. in Finland, and Iness ought
to break it before the year is over.
Jack Davis ran a .14.0 high hur
dles. Stanford's is a slow track and
this rates as the best flight of high
hurdles run in the nation this year.
O'Brien. Davis, Jim Lea, and Verl
Sorgen accounted for 39Vfe points
between them and it's tough to beat
a team with men like that. Stan
ford couldn't and the rest of the
nation won't either.

urday in the Stadium. The final score was 79 3 /4 to 51'/».
The Cards won all the events they were supposed to, and the
Trojans won all their sure firsts, generally setting a meet record
while they were at it. When the event was considered a toss-up,

then USC always seemed to prevail.
In the 100, probably the crucial
race of the day, all predicted that
the field would hit the tape to
gether with anybody first. But an
unheralded Joe GrafTio, running
with an injured hand, ground out a
beautiful 9.7 century.

The Cards' versatile ace Bob Ma

broad jYimp, and was held to two
points for the afternoon.
There were numerous bright
spots in I lie picture for Card ad

Loren Sorenson went over 22

the javelin. Bob Heed grabbed a

Parry O'Brien pushed the iron
ball 57 ft. lOV2 in. or about one foot
short of the world mark. Every one
of his efforts surpassed the .55-foot
"mark. O'Brien starts his throw by
facing directly away from where he
is putting. His 180 - degree pivot,
speed across the circle, and strength
provide awe-inspiring results.
Sim Iness, fighting off a queasy
stomach, broke the American rec
ord with a gargantuan 185-ft. 51/4-
in. discus toss. Minnesota's fortune
Gordien set the world mark of 18G
ft. 11 in. in Finland, and Iness ought
to break it before the year is over.
Jack Davis ran a .14.0 high hur

this rates as the best flight of high
