# The 						Sumner Matter
## 
### 
It is only after careful thought that we con
sider a guestion which is, speaking in the strict
est terms, not within our jurisdiction. We are
somewhat in the position of preferred or non
voting stockholders attempting to influence the
management of a corporation.
Nevertheless, an issue has arisen. And an
issue tends to aggravate a problem by forcing
men to choose sides and lose their objectivity.
Therefore, we consider the guestion, not with
an aim toward demanding a decision contrary
to that already made, but toward resolving
opinion.
It is reported below that the contract of Dr.
Alfred R. Sumner, Assistant Professor of
Geography, will not be renewed after its ex
piration at the close of spring guarter.
According to President Sterling, the matter
is "closed."
What has happened and how has the matter
become "closed?"
A university academician is somewhat in the
position of a motion picture player. The man
starts out with a modest title and at a modest
salary just as the movie player starts out at a
relatively low salary and the designation bit
player.
If the contract is periodically renewed with
promotions, the academician eventually be
comes a full professor with a corresponding
salary just as a starlet becomes a star if all her
options are picked up.
In the case of Stanford, the recommenda
tions for promotion or release aretnade by
the department heads to the president of the
University. The recommendations are then
referred to the president's Academic Advis
ory Board for its review.
If a recommendation is positive, the president
takes it to the Board of Trustees for approval.
In the case of Dr. Sumner, the recommenda
tion ct Dr. C. Langdon White, head of the
Geography Department, was negative. The

Academic Board reviewed the recommenda
tion and by a large majority, though not
unanimously, we understand, voted to ap
prove its content: i.e., not to rehire Dr. Sum
ner.
Since there exists at Stanford a great degree
of departmental autonomy and a highly devel
oped faculty government, the hands of the
president are, so to speak, tied. If he attempted
to override directly the decision of his advisory
system, he would seriously jeopardize the posi
tion it is trying to fulfill.
There is only one way the decision might
possibly be altered. That is, for the depart
ment head to reconsider his recommendation.
But we hesitate to advise that this would
solve the problem, since there are personal dif
ferences involved. To that all sides
would kiss and make up if Dr. Sumner re
mained within the department is highly ideal
istic.
It is almost axiomatic that if any man and
his superiors cannot get along, that man, not
his superiors, is released. The fact may be
sad, in view of the loss to students. Never
theless, it is true.
But we are idealistic, so we imagine the Stan
ford community to be composed of men with
larger personalities than the average univer
sity. We imagine that Stanford men can correct
their errors and resolve their differences.
If this be true, we ask the head of the Geog
raphy Department to reconsider his recommen
dation.
If this be untrue, and if the students really
believe Dr. Sumner to be as outstanding a
man as they say, we ask them not to make
such an issue as to attach a stigma to the
man's reputation.
We ask them to allow the Stanford commu
nity to take the loss rather than to run the risk
of hurting Sumner's chances for a successful
career in the future.

comes a full professor with a corresponding
salary just as a starlet becomes a star if all her
options are picked up.
In the case of Stanford, the recommenda
tions for promotion or release aretnade by
the department heads to the president of the
University. The recommendations are then
referred to the president's Academic Advis
ory Board for its review.
If a recommendation is positive, the president
takes it to the Board of Trustees for approval.
In the case of Dr. Sumner, the recommenda
tion ct Dr. C. Langdon White, head of the
Geography Department, was negative. The

Academic Board reviewed the recommenda
tion and by a large majority, though not
unanimously, we understand, voted to ap
prove its content: i.e., not to rehire Dr. Sum
ner.
Since there exists at Stanford a great degree
of departmental autonomy and a highly devel
oped faculty government, the hands of the
president are, so to speak, tied. If he attempted
to override directly the decision of his advisory
system, he would seriously jeopardize the posi
tion it is trying to fulfill.
There is only one way the decision might
possibly be altered. That is, for the depart
ment head to reconsider his recommendation.
But we hesitate to advise that this would
solve the problem, since there are personal dif
ferences involved. To that all sides
would kiss and make up if Dr. Sumner re
mained within the department is highly ideal
istic.
It is almost axiomatic that if any man and
his superiors cannot get along, that man, not
his superiors, is released. The fact may be
sad, in view of the loss to students. Never
theless, it is true.
But we are idealistic, so we imagine the Stan
ford community to be composed of men with
larger personalities than the average univer
sity. We imagine that Stanford men can correct
their errors and resolve their differences.
If this be true, we ask the head of the Geog
raphy Department to reconsider his recommen
dation.
If this be untrue, and if the students really
believe Dr. Sumner to be as outstanding a
man as they say, we ask them not to make
such an issue as to attach a stigma to the
man's reputation.
We ask them to allow the Stanford commu
nity to take the loss rather than to run the risk
of hurting Sumner's chances for a successful
career in the future.
It is only after careful thought that we con
sider a guestion which is, speaking in the strict
est terms, not within our jurisdiction. We are
somewhat in the position of preferred or non
voting stockholders attempting to influence the
management of a corporation.
Nevertheless, an issue has arisen. And an
issue tends to aggravate a problem by forcing
men to choose sides and lose their objectivity.
Therefore, we consider the guestion, not with
an aim toward demanding a decision contrary
to that already made, but toward resolving
opinion.
It is reported below that the contract of Dr.
Alfred R. Sumner, Assistant Professor of
Geography, will not be renewed after its ex
piration at the close of spring guarter.
According to President Sterling, the matter
is "closed."
What has happened and how has the matter
become "closed?"
A university academician is somewhat in the
position of a motion picture player. The man
starts out with a modest title and at a modest
salary just as the movie player starts out at a
relatively low salary and the designation bit
player.
If the contract is periodically renewed with
promotions, the academician eventually be
comes a full professor with a corresponding
salary just as a starlet becomes a star if all her
options are picked up.
