### PETE GROTHE 
Dr. Alfred Sumner of the Geography Department
is leaving Stanford at the end of Spring quarter.
The departure of Dr. Sumner means that Stanford
is losing one of its most valuable assets. As one pro
fessor said recently. "I can think of few professors in
this school, such as Nobel Prize winner Felix Bloch,
who have done more for Stanford public relations
than Dr. Sumner."
Why is the tanned, deep-voiced geography profes-

sor of such uncommon worth to ,
Stanford? Let's consider some of
the factors:
1. His superior teaching ability, j
Witness some cold statistics: The j
last time Economic Geography I
was given, it was taught by a j
very able professor, and 58 signeil j
to take it. Dr. Sumner is teaching j
the same course this quarter at !
8 a.m., usually an unpopular time, (
and close to 170 have enrolled. *

A course of apparently limited interest called "Geog
raphy of the Pacific Coast" is also being taught by
Sumner this quarter and 100 are in it.
Listed in the Spring quarter Time Schedule is a
course called "Seminar in Geopolitics." Seminar . . .
that means about 15 usually. Well over 100 signed
to take Dr. Sumner's evening "seminar."
Witness another rarity: Approximately 225 students
signed a petition last quarter to have Sumner give
a regular geopolitics course during Spring quarter.
The head of the geography department turned it
down, however.
As one student said about l)r. Sumner's lectur
ing abilities, "When I walk out of most of my clas
ses, I talk about next week's dance or last Saturday's
ball game. When I finish an hour in Dr. Sumner's
class, I start discussing with other students some
of the ideas that he put forth and do research on
them. In short, what he says and the way he says
it inspires students to pursue the subject outside of
class."
In short, it's a truism that Dr. Sumner is considered
by the students to be one of the outstanding lecturers
in this school. He is in a class with Dr. Bailey, Dr.
Speigleberg, Dr. Fagan, and others.
2. His great devotion to his students. He gives
much time to meeting with them.
One day. for example, he taught his classes, then
spoke to a youth group in San Jose, was asked to
talk at a fraternity at dinnertime, and then later in
the evening met with a group of students who wanted
to discuss geopolitics with him.
3. His television work. "People. Places, and Poli
tics," the Stanford TV show, was entirely Sumner's
idea. This weekly program on current world prob
lems received a high honor from the Northern Cali
fornia Television Academy. It was one of two shows
to receive awards, the other being the "Standard
Hour."
According to Dr. Stanley Donner of the Speech and
Drama Department, who supervised the series, Dr.
Sumner, who appeared on the show each week, was
.11 ....... »t •

"People, Places, and Politics," which received a
large grant from the Ford Foundation, was estimated
to have a weekly audience of 100.000 listeners, pretty
good for competing with the prize fights. There is a
good chance that CBS will take this kinescoped pro
gram and use is as a summer replacement. In this
case, the show will appear in 30 cities with an esti
mated two million persons listening to the Stanford
program.
In short, Dr. Sumner's idea has materialized into
something that is of mass educational benefit, and
the hundreds of letters and telegrams that have
poured in testify to the program's popularity.
4. Dr. Sumner's public relations value. Sumner,
an ex-Yale trackman and a Navy officer in the last
war, has been a highly-positive influence in Stanford
public relations. He devised an original, almost-revo
lutionary type of field trip ... a geographical air trip.
It met with instant success and was widely oeclaimod
in the San Francisco Chronicle, the Alumni Review,
and other publications. There is even talk of Life
magazine devoting an article to it this Spring.
Three articles in the Chronicle have appeared on
Dr. Sumner. Further, he is a frequent guest speaker
at Bay Area clubs, and, as such, he is, of course,
introduced as "Dr. Alfred Sumner of Stanford Uni
versity," another boost for Farm public relations.
As we said at the beginning of this article. Dr.
Sumner is leaving Stanford University. He is not
leaving because he wants to. He is leaving be
cause bis three-year contract has not been renewed.
Students learned of this, and the reaction was im
mediate and overwhelming. A petition urging that
Sumner be retained on the faculty was passed around,
and GOl students signed it . . . approximately one
seventh of the undergraduate student body.
However, the administration, some of whose men
are among the most able in the country, didn't change
the decision. The reason they gave is that Dr. Sum
ner's research accomplishments have been too modest,
and that a Stanford professor must do research.
Although Dr. Sumner has offered to help the head
of the Geography Department in his research and
wrote an article last month for the leading geographi
cal publication of its type, his research has been ad
mittedly modest.
Rut students. 601 of them at least, are wondering
if his electrifying teaching abilities, which inspire
students to mental activity beyond the call of class
room duty isn't enough reason to keep him at Stan
ford.
They are wondering if his devotion to the students
and the uncommonly large amount of time he spends
with them isn't an important factor.
They are wondering if his staggering public rela
tions value isn't worth having him at Stanford.
They are wondering if his television accomplish
ments aren't far more valuable than any reserch he
could turn out.
They are wondering, 601 of them particularly, to
what extent the students' voice counts around here.
Yes. they are wondering all these things as Dr.
Allied Sumner, a teacher, not a research man, teaches
lu.s last quarter at Stanford.

them. In short, what he says and the way he says
it inspires students to pursue the subject outside of
class."
In short, it's a truism that Dr. Sumner is considered
by the students to be one of the outstanding lecturers
in this school. He is in a class with Dr. Bailey, Dr.
Speigleberg, Dr. Fagan, and others.
2. His great devotion to his students. He gives
much time to meeting with them.
One day. for example, he taught his classes, then
spoke to a youth group in San Jose, was asked to
talk at a fraternity at dinnertime, and then later in
the evening met with a group of students who wanted
to discuss geopolitics with him.
3. His television work. "People. Places, and Poli
tics," the Stanford TV show, was entirely Sumner's
idea. This weekly program on current world prob
lems received a high honor from the Northern Cali
fornia Television Academy. It was one of two shows
to receive awards, the other being the "Standard
Hour."
According to Dr. Stanley Donner of the Speech and
Drama Department, who supervised the series, Dr.
Sumner, who appeared on the show each week, was
.11 ....... »t •

"People, Places, and Politics," which received a
large grant from the Ford Foundation, was estimated
to have a weekly audience of 100.000 listeners, pretty
good for competing with the prize fights. There is a
good chance that CBS will take this kinescoped pro
gram and use is as a summer replacement. In this
case, the show will appear in 30 cities with an esti
mated two million persons listening to the Stanford
program.
In short, Dr. Sumner's idea has materialized into
something that is of mass educational benefit, and
the hundreds of letters and telegrams that have
poured in testify to the program's popularity.
4. Dr. Sumner's public relations value. Sumner,
an ex-Yale trackman and a Navy officer in the last
war, has been a highly-positive influence in Stanford
public relations. He devised an original, almost-revo
lutionary type of field trip ... a geographical air trip.
It met with instant success and was widely oeclaimod
in the San Francisco Chronicle, the Alumni Review,
and other publications. There is even talk of Life
magazine devoting an article to it this Spring.
Three articles in the Chronicle have appeared on
Dr. Sumner. Further, he is a frequent guest speaker
at Bay Area clubs, and, as such, he is, of course,
introduced as "Dr. Alfred Sumner of Stanford Uni
versity," another boost for Farm public relations.
As we said at the beginning of this article. Dr.
Sumner is leaving Stanford University. He is not
leaving because he wants to. He is leaving be
cause bis three-year contract has not been renewed.
Students learned of this, and the reaction was im
mediate and overwhelming. A petition urging that
Sumner be retained on the faculty was passed around,
and GOl students signed it . . . approximately one
seventh of the undergraduate student body.
However, the administration, some of whose men
are among the most able in the country, didn't change
the decision. The reason they gave is that Dr. Sum
ner's research accomplishments have been too modest,
and that a Stanford professor must do research.
Although Dr. Sumner has offered to help the head
of the Geography Department in his research and
wrote an article last month for the leading geographi
cal publication of its type, his research has been ad
mittedly modest.
Rut students. 601 of them at least, are wondering
if his electrifying teaching abilities, which inspire
students to mental activity beyond the call of class
room duty isn't enough reason to keep him at Stan
ford.
They are wondering if his devotion to the students
and the uncommonly large amount of time he spends
with them isn't an important factor.
They are wondering if his staggering public rela
tions value isn't worth having him at Stanford.
They are wondering if his television accomplish
ments aren't far more valuable than any reserch he
could turn out.
They are wondering, 601 of them particularly, to
what extent the students' voice counts around here.
Yes. they are wondering all these things as Dr.
Allied Sumner, a teacher, not a research man, teaches
lu.s last quarter at Stanford.

Dr. Alfred Sumner of the Geography Department
is leaving Stanford at the end of Spring quarter.
The departure of Dr. Sumner means that Stanford
is losing one of its most valuable assets. As one pro
fessor said recently. "I can think of few professors in
this school, such as Nobel Prize winner Felix Bloch,
who have done more for Stanford public relations
than Dr. Sumner."
Why is the tanned, deep-voiced geography profes-

sor of such uncommon worth to ,
Stanford? Let's consider some of
the factors:
1. His superior teaching ability, j
Witness some cold statistics: The j
last time Economic Geography I
was given, it was taught by a j
very able professor, and 58 signeil j
to take it. Dr. Sumner is teaching j
the same course this quarter at !
8 a.m., usually an unpopular time, (
and close to 170 have enrolled. *

A course of apparently limited interest called "Geog
raphy of the Pacific Coast" is also being taught by
Sumner this quarter and 100 are in it.
Listed in the Spring quarter Time Schedule is a
course called "Seminar in Geopolitics." Seminar . . .
that means about 15 usually. Well over 100 signed
to take Dr. Sumner's evening "seminar."
Witness another rarity: Approximately 225 students
signed a petition last quarter to have Sumner give
a regular geopolitics course during Spring quarter.
The head of the geography department turned it
down, however.
As one student said about l)r. Sumner's lectur
ing abilities, "When I walk out of most of my clas
ses, I talk about next week's dance or last Saturday's
ball game. When I finish an hour in Dr. Sumner's
class, I start discussing with other students some
of the ideas that he put forth and do research on
them. In short, what he says and the way he says
it inspires students to pursue the subject outside of

poured in testify to the program's popularity.
4. Dr. Sumner's public relations value. Sumner,
an ex-Yale trackman and a Navy officer in the last
war, has been a highly-positive influence in Stanford
public relations. He devised an original, almost-revo
lutionary type of field trip ... a geographical air trip.
It met with instant success and was widely oeclaimod
in the San Francisco Chronicle, the Alumni Review,
and other publications. There is even talk of Life
magazine devoting an article to it this Spring.
Three articles in the Chronicle have appeared on
Dr. Sumner. Further, he is a frequent guest speaker
at Bay Area clubs, and, as such, he is, of course,
introduced as "Dr. Alfred Sumner of Stanford Uni
versity," another boost for Farm public relations.
As we said at the beginning of this article. Dr.
Sumner is leaving Stanford University. He is not
leaving because he wants to. He is leaving be
cause bis three-year contract has not been renewed.
Students learned of this, and the reaction was im
mediate and overwhelming. A petition urging that
Sumner be retained on the faculty was passed around,
and GOl students signed it . . . approximately one
seventh of the undergraduate student body.
However, the administration, some of whose men
are among the most able in the country, didn't change
the decision. The reason they gave is that Dr. Sum
ner's research accomplishments have been too modest,
and that a Stanford professor must do research.
Although Dr. Sumner has offered to help the head
of the Geography Department in his research and
wrote an article last month for the leading geographi
cal publication of its type, his research has been ad
mittedly modest.
Rut students. 601 of them at least, are wondering
if his electrifying teaching abilities, which inspire
students to mental activity beyond the call of class
room duty isn't enough reason to keep him at Stan
ford.
They are wondering if his devotion to the students
and the uncommonly large amount of time he spends
with them isn't an important factor.
They are wondering if his staggering public rela
tions value isn't worth having him at Stanford.
They are wondering if his television accomplish
ments aren't far more valuable than any reserch he
could turn out.
They are wondering, 601 of them particularly, to
what extent the students' voice counts around here.
Yes. they are wondering all these things as Dr.
Allied Sumner, a teacher, not a research man, teaches
lu.s last quarter at Stanford.

Dr. Alfred Sumner of the Geography Department
is leaving Stanford at the end of Spring quarter.
The departure of Dr. Sumner means that Stanford
is losing one of its most valuable assets. As one pro
fessor said recently. "I can think of few professors in
this school, such as Nobel Prize winner Felix Bloch,
who have done more for Stanford public relations
than Dr. Sumner."
Why is the tanned, deep-voiced geography profes-

sor of such uncommon worth to ,
Stanford? Let's consider some of
the factors:
1. His superior teaching ability, j
Witness some cold statistics: The j
last time Economic Geography I
was given, it was taught by a j
very able professor, and 58 signeil j
to take it. Dr. Sumner is teaching j
the same course this quarter at !
8 a.m., usually an unpopular time, (
and close to 170 have enrolled. *

A course of apparently limited interest called "Geog
raphy of the Pacific Coast" is also being taught by
Sumner this quarter and 100 are in it.
Listed in the Spring quarter Time Schedule is a
course called "Seminar in Geopolitics." Seminar . . .
that means about 15 usually. Well over 100 signed
to take Dr. Sumner's evening "seminar."
Witness another rarity: Approximately 225 students
signed a petition last quarter to have Sumner give
a regular geopolitics course during Spring quarter.
The head of the geography department turned it
down, however.
As one student said about l)r. Sumner's lectur
ing abilities, "When I walk out of most of my clas
ses, I talk about next week's dance or last Saturday's
ball game. When I finish an hour in Dr. Sumner's
class, I start discussing with other students some
of the ideas that he put forth and do research on
them. In short, what he says and the way he says
it inspires students to pursue the subject outside of
class."
In short, it's a truism that Dr. Sumner is considered
by the students to be one of the outstanding lecturers
in this school. He is in a class with Dr. Bailey, Dr.
Speigleberg, Dr. Fagan, and others.
2. His great devotion to his students. He gives
much time to meeting with them.
One day. for example, he taught his classes, then
spoke to a youth group in San Jose, was asked to
talk at a fraternity at dinnertime, and then later in
the evening met with a group of students who wanted
to discuss geopolitics with him.
3. His television work. "People. Places, and Poli
tics," the Stanford TV show, was entirely Sumner's
idea. This weekly program on current world prob
lems received a high honor from the Northern Cali
fornia Television Academy. It was one of two shows
to receive awards, the other being the "Standard
Hour."
According to Dr. Stanley Donner of the Speech and
Drama Department, who supervised the series, Dr.
Sumner, who appeared on the show each week, was
.11 ....... »t •

"People, Places, and Politics," which received a
large grant from the Ford Foundation, was estimated
to have a weekly audience of 100.000 listeners, pretty
good for competing with the prize fights. There is a
good chance that CBS will take this kinescoped pro
gram and use is as a summer replacement. In this
case, the show will appear in 30 cities with an esti
mated two million persons listening to the Stanford
program.
In short, Dr. Sumner's idea has materialized into
something that is of mass educational benefit, and
the hundreds of letters and telegrams that have
poured in testify to the program's popularity.
