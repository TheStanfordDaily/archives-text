Facing COP and the Alumni over
the weekend, Sti/nford baseball
hurlers allowed nine runs, 16 hits,
and 10 bases on balls.
This ineffectiveness didn't bother
them much, though, for at the same
time Indian batters were pounding
the opposition for 37 runs, as Ever
ett Dean's horsehiders took a pair
of easy victories, submerging the
Tigers 23-4 and the Alums 14-5.
Dean used the platoon system in
both contests. Midway through the
games he substituted entirely new
teams, exactly 18 men participating.
The fifth inning seems to be the
lucky frame for Indian batsmen.
Friday they scored 10 runs, led by
Warren Goodrich, who boomed two
triples in the same inning. Added
to two other singles, this gave him
four hits in five trips, to lead the
Indian team. Catcher Jack Shepard
was close behind with three for five,
a trio of doubles in the third, fourth,
and fifth frames.
Phil Page and Don DeLong saw
action in the first contest, while
Mike Acker and Ken Brown par

ticipated in the platoon act on Sat
urday. Chuck Essegiun and Dick
Cole led the Card batsmen, both
with a single and a double in three
trips.

Alameda Coast Guard, one of
the four teams to defeat the Stan
ford Itasehall team this season,
will play the Card nine in a re
turn engagement this afternoon at
3:15 in the Sunken Diamond. This
tilt replaces the Fresno State
game originally scheduled for to
day which was canceled because
of travel difficulties incurred by
Fresno.

The weekend was a very helpful
one in CIBA play for the Indians.
Cal downed Santa Clara twice and
USC likewise subdued UCLA. This
left the league standings as follows:
Stanford 4 1 ...
Cal 3 3 li/ 2
UCLA 3 4 2
USC 3 4 2
Santa Clara 2 3 2
