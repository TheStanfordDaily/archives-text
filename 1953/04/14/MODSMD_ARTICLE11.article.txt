# Public Administrators Hear Talk on Use of Case Reports
## 
### 
A new technique—"The Use of
Cases in Teaching Public Adminis
tration" — was described yesterday
afternoon in the Political Science
to 40 members of the Stan
ford chapter of the American So
ciety for Public Administration by
Dr. Harold Stein, chairman of the
Inter-University Case Program.
Public relations case reports, pio
neered by Harvard University and
later introduced to other schools
through the activities of the Case
Program, arc accounts of the solu
tions to decision situations in public
administration.
They are similar to law cases, ex
cept that their purpose is primarily
their use in teaching. The original
reason for drawing up law cases is
simply the instruction of the parties
involved in legal action.

The complexity of public admin
istration cases compared to business
administration or law cases is per
haps of greatest value, according to
Dr. Stein, since it gives the student
a feeling for the activities and in
terrelationships involved in public
administration.
Dr. Stein said that the emotional
reactions of students of these cases,
especially when they are called
upon to act the parts of the people
involved, is sometimes so violent
tji;»t "they will not speak to
other for days."
He noted, however, that exclusive
use of cases is not effective in teach
ing the general rules of public ad
ministration. They arc useful only
as supplementary material, illus
trating many specific facets of ad
-1 ministration problems.
