## 'Force, Education' Needed To End Mau Man Terror 
### HADLEY ROFF Associate Editor, The Daily 
It will take force, re-education, and the development of native
industry and agriculture to counter the present savage victories
of the Mau Mau terroristic group in Kenya, Africa, Dr. Edgar Barton
Worthington, secretary general of the Scientific Council of Africa,
stressed here yesterday.
Speaking to an intent group of about 100 in Cubberley Audito-

rium, the slight Britisher outlined
the main objectives facing Kenyan
Officials today: the re-establishment
of order and the restoration of con
fidence among the natives.
But to do this, "'some degree of
force will be required," Dr. Worth
ington advised.
Law and order must be the first
objective, he said, particularly in
view of (he recent intensification
of Man Mail activity.
Dr. Worthington stressed, how
ever, that the Mau Mau crisis, al
though serious, docs not involve a
majority of (he native population
in the Crown Colony. In fact, he
pointed out, (he Mau Mau repre
sent only about half the popula
tion of one of the 110 native tribes
in Kenya, namely (he Kikuyu.
He said (lie present population of
(he tribe is estimated at one and
a half million persons.
But most of these members, he
advised, were enlisted under threat
and are really not willing members.
He said that the Mau Mau puts
strong emphasis on witchcraft and
voodoo, superstitions still alive in
the Kikuyu tradition.
Chief objective of the terrorist
group is to drive the white man
from Kenya. The group's attitude is
anti-white and anti-Christian.
The Mau Mau agitation has led
to a number of growingly infectious
problems. One of these is the open
intimidation of the native popula
tion, forcing it into non-co-opera
tion with officials. Another nascent
problem raised is lite re-stirring of
age-old rivalries between tribes,
I particularly the Massi and the Ki
[ kuyu.
Though forceful re-establishment
I of order is the first call of business
ijin Kenya, the second and perhaps
1 most challenging is the job of rc

viving the confidence of the natives.
This can be done primarily by de
velopment of native industry and
agriculture, he said.
lie pointed out (hat many steps
for aiding (he technological ad
vance of (ho Macks have been
taken in recent years by (he Ken
ya government and by Great Brit
ain. Dr. Worthington cited the
opening of a college in Uganda
and the encouragement of pri
mary and secondary eduaction
through all (he East African col
onics.
At present, he said, heavy stress
is being laid on the further growth
of primary education.
Through this build-up of primary
education, it is hoped, he said, that
a more serviceable discipline can
be widely inculcated among the na
tives. One of the reasons for the
present troubles, he said, is the lack
of a solid, well-based rule of con
duct. The old conventions of tribal
conduct, washed away under the
influence of the white man, have as
yet not been replaced.
Perhaps one of the greatest spurs
to the Mau Mau uprisings, in Dr.
Worthington's opinion, is the popu
lation pressure within the Kikuyu
territory. He reported that in some
areas more than 200 persons arc ex
pected to extract a living from an
j acre.
This pressure is primarily due to
the sharp increase in native popu
lation since the coming of the white
man.
Dr. Worthington's picture was not
altogether gloomy, for in the future,
perhaps two generations away, he
t sees a time when the inter-racial
difficulties will be ended and "Af
-1 lieu can live in peace and progress.''

It will take force, re-education, and the development of native
industry and agriculture to counter the present savage victories
of the Mau Mau terroristic group in Kenya, Africa, Dr. Edgar Barton
Worthington, secretary general of the Scientific Council of Africa,
stressed here yesterday.
Speaking to an intent group of about 100 in Cubberley Audito-

rium, the slight Britisher outlined
the main objectives facing Kenyan
Officials today: the re-establishment
of order and the restoration of con
fidence among the natives.
But to do this, "'some degree of
force will be required," Dr. Worth
ington advised.
Law and order must be the first
objective, he said, particularly in
view of (he recent intensification
of Man Mail activity.
Dr. Worthington stressed, how
ever, that the Mau Mau crisis, al
though serious, docs not involve a
majority of (he native population
in the Crown Colony. In fact, he
pointed out, (he Mau Mau repre
sent only about half the popula
tion of one of the 110 native tribes
in Kenya, namely (he Kikuyu.
He said (lie present population of
(he tribe is estimated at one and
a half million persons.
But most of these members, he
advised, were enlisted under threat
and are really not willing members.
He said that the Mau Mau puts
strong emphasis on witchcraft and
voodoo, superstitions still alive in
the Kikuyu tradition.
Chief objective of the terrorist
group is to drive the white man
from Kenya. The group's attitude is
anti-white and anti-Christian.
The Mau Mau agitation has led
to a number of growingly infectious
problems. One of these is the open
intimidation of the native popula
tion, forcing it into non-co-opera
tion with officials. Another nascent
problem raised is lite re-stirring of
age-old rivalries between tribes,
I particularly the Massi and the Ki
[ kuyu.
Though forceful re-establishment
I of order is the first call of business
ijin Kenya, the second and perhaps
1 most challenging is the job of rc

viving the confidence of the natives.
This can be done primarily by de
velopment of native industry and
agriculture, he said.
lie pointed out (hat many steps
for aiding (he technological ad
vance of (ho Macks have been
taken in recent years by (he Ken
ya government and by Great Brit
ain. Dr. Worthington cited the
opening of a college in Uganda
and the encouragement of pri
mary and secondary eduaction
through all (he East African col
onics.
At present, he said, heavy stress
is being laid on the further growth
of primary education.
Through this build-up of primary
education, it is hoped, he said, that
a more serviceable discipline can
be widely inculcated among the na
tives. One of the reasons for the
present troubles, he said, is the lack
of a solid, well-based rule of con
duct. The old conventions of tribal
conduct, washed away under the
influence of the white man, have as
yet not been replaced.
Perhaps one of the greatest spurs
to the Mau Mau uprisings, in Dr.
Worthington's opinion, is the popu
lation pressure within the Kikuyu
territory. He reported that in some
areas more than 200 persons arc ex
pected to extract a living from an
j acre.
This pressure is primarily due to
the sharp increase in native popu
lation since the coming of the white
man.
Dr. Worthington's picture was not
altogether gloomy, for in the future,
perhaps two generations away, he
t sees a time when the inter-racial
difficulties will be ended and "Af
-1 lieu can live in peace and progress.''
