# 'Copter to Lift Blood Today
## 
### 
From Stanford to Korea!
A shipment of type "O" whole
blood will leave Stanford this morn
ing by helicopter headed for use on
the Korean battlefields. At 11 a.m.,
a Hiller helicopter will land at the
soccer field near the Pavilion dona
tion center.
A load of type "O" blood collect
ed in the current mammoth drive
will be loaded on the plane. From
there it will go to Moflfett Field,
where a Military Air Transport
will take over.
The blood then goes to Travis Air
Force Base, a main dispatch center
for shipment of blood overseas. The
next stop: Korea.
A crowd of spectators, as well as
newsreel, TV, and newspapermen, is
expected to watch the loading of the
helicopter.
Other type "O" blood collected in
the current drive is sent to San Jose
by truck and goes from there to
Moffett Field. Type "O," usable by
anyone, is the only type sent as
whole blood.
Other types of blood arc sent to
special laboratories for processing
into plasma and serum albumin
especially useful for treatment of
shock during winter fighting since
it doesn't freeze.
The portion of the blood not used
for serum albumin is made into
gamma globulin, now being used for
treatment of polio.
