# Determined Coed's Efforts Pay Off

### PETE GROTHE 
The story of a pint of blood took I
a new twist yesterday.
Sydney Wafton, a diminutive sen
ior poli sci major from San Fran
cisco, had wanted to contribute to
the blood drive in the worst pos
sible way. Several weeks ago, when
she first heard about the drive, she
was determined to give.
There was one hitch. A blood
donor has to weigh at least 110
pounds. Sydney hardly tipped the
scales at 100 after a fife-course tur
key dinner.
But Sydney was a determined
girl. She stuffed herself at regular
Union meals, frequented the Cellar
food counter, and consumed every
available morsel in her campaign of
"reach 110 pounds or bust."
Finally, the day of reckoning
came. Sydney woke up yesterday
morning and raced to the scale. The
marker inched up to 107 pounds and
then stopped.
"There must be soinc mistake,"
cried Sydney.
She whipped to another scale, but
it registered the same count. /
There was only one solution. Syd
ney put two heavy ashtrays in each
of her coat pockets, barnacled her
self with jewelry, grabbed a mas
sive stack of books, and set off for
the Pavilion.
At the Pavilion, the nurse ordered
Sydney to get on the scale. Sydney
did, insisting that she hold her vol
umes of books in her arms. Strange
ly enough the scale indicated 113
pounds.
Sydney gave her pint of blood.
