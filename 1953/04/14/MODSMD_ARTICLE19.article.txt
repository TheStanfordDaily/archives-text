"Man and Superman," George
Bernard Shaw's comedy, will be
presented by the Stanford Players
on April 30, May 1, and May 2 in
the Memorial Theater. This is the
first offering of the regular sub
scription series.
In writing this play, Shaw, under
the influence of Nietzsche's philos
ophy, expounds his theory of the
superman. The plan was written in
1003 and hailed by various critics as
"the original battle of the sexes of
the twentieth century." Shaw pulls
no punches in his revelation of the
powers of the feminine sex in their
pursuit of the male,

"Man and Superman" was onr of
the most poprlar plays in the dra
matic program of the Festival of
Britain. The "Don Juan in Hell"
sequence, omitted in this production

in New York, San Francisco, and
Chicago.

scenery by Wendell Cole. The en
tire production will be directed by
A. Nicholas Vardac.
