## Reed Asks House to Vote On Measure to Cut Taxes 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 13 (UP) —Rep. Daniel A. Reed appealed
to the House today to by-pass its Republican leaders and force an
immediate vote on his bill to cut individual income taxes about 10
per cent on July 1.
The New York Republican, chairman of the, tax-writing House

Ways and Means Committee which
already has approved the bill, urged
all members of the House to "show
the people you really meant it
when you said they would get a tax
cut."
Simultaneously, Tax Commission
er T. Coleman Andrews reported
that the number of refunds to tax
payers this year will top last year's
29,000,000 by 250,000- He also an
nounced a plan to cut red tape in
filing some business tax returns.
Reed filed a petition to dis
charge the House Rules Commit
tee from further consideration of
his hill. The measure has been
bottled up in the rules group,
which channels legislation to the
door. President Eisenhower and
(iOP Congressional leaders want
a balanced budget in sight before
cutting taxes.
Under Reed's petition, which re
quires Ihe signatures of 218 House
members, the bill would be brought
to the floor under a so-called
"closed rule" barring any amend
ments. Reed took that precaution to
make certain his measure was not
riddled with crippling riders.
