# First-day Blood Drive Donations Total 736
## Today’s Signups Increase; Chairman Aims at Record 
### 
Donations totaled 736 pints last night at the end of the first day
of Stanford's record-breaking Blood Drive.
The total puts Stanford behind in the 1,000 pints a day needed
to meet the 5,000-pint quota. By last night, signups totaled about
4,300 —but approximately 6,000 are needed to allow for disquali-

fications.
Disqualifications yesterday ran
around 27 per cent. Persons who
came in to give totaled 864.
Signups for today have reached
1,239. The record up to now has
been 1,167 pints, donated in one day
by Soledad Prison, and Blood Drive
Chairman Ken Schechter hopes to
set a new one today.
The Pavilion has been trans
formed into a busy, hospital-like
collection center for the duration
of the drive. Close to 140 pro
fessional Red Cross Viorkers, Red
Cross volunteers, and students are
on duty all the time. Mass pro
duction methods have speeded up
the process. Few students report
ed any waiting.
Signups are still being sought—
both from Palo Alto and the Stan
ford area. Students who live in the
Village or on campus can still sign
up with their living group repre
sentatives. Faculty members and
other University employees can
turn their appointment cards in to
their departments or at the box in
front of the Cellar.
Appointments can also be made at
tables at the Cellar, on Engineering
corner, and in front of the Law and
Biz Schools — or by phoning the
BJood Drive office, DA 3-8096 or
DA 3-7712.
Donors may go to the Pavilion
without an appointment if they
are willing to wait, but to avoid
delay they are asked to sign up
in advance.
The 72-bed donation center in the
Pavilion will be open today, Thurs
day, and Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5
p.m. Tomorrow hours will be 11
a.m. to 7 p.m.
Giving blood takes about an hour.
Donors are asked not to eat any
thing but fruit juice, coffee, and dry
toast for four hours before giving
This is because' if there is any fat
in the system, the blood is useless.
Minors' consent cards will be on
file in the Pavilion. Anyone be
tween 18 and 21 who hasn't turned
in his card is asked to bring it with
him when he gives blood.

Donations totaled 736 pints last night at the end of the first day
of Stanford's record-breaking Blood Drive.
The total puts Stanford behind in the 1,000 pints a day needed

4,300 —but approximately 6,000 are needed to allow for disquali-

fications.
Disqualifications yesterday ran
around 27 per cent. Persons who
came in to give totaled 864.
Signups for today have reached
1,239. The record up to now has
been 1,167 pints, donated in one day
by Soledad Prison, and Blood Drive

duction methods have speeded up

Village or on campus can still sign

sentatives. Faculty members and
other University employees can
turn their appointment cards in to
their departments or at the box in
