NO BASKETBALL THIS WEEK--Stanford's Pavilion
has been the scene of basketball games, dances,
registration, and rallies. But never before has it held
72 cots, a host of Red Cross and student Blood Drive

workers, and 732 students and Palo Altans who
turned out yesterday to donate blood toward Stan
ford's 5,000-pint goal. Workers started setting up
the well-organized equipment as early as last Sat-

urday in preparation for donors. Today the Drive
Committee hopes to break the one-day donation
record of 1,167 set by Soledad Prison. With 1,239
persons signed up, Stanford has a chance of doing it.


1. "I arrived at the Pavilion at 8:30 a.m. Naturally I was a little worried, for although the blood
collecting process was described to me as simple and painless, I had my doubts. The reception
ist was very nice. She checked my parental permission slip and then verified my campus ad
dress. Then I was sent on my way like the 900 students who came to give blood yesterday."


2. "The next step was the nurses' station inside the Pavilion
where my temperature was checked and pulse beat taken.
Best of all, I got a large glass of orange juice from one of the
student canteen Nvorkers. Here I am having my blood tested
for hemoglobin. I wasn't anaemic (no surprise). And fortunate
ly I'm one of those universal donors —the type 'O' variety. Kind
of thrilling to think my blood will be in Korea by Friday."


3. "At last I got one of the precious pint bottles that a few min
utes later would be holding my blood. Nurse's Aide Jean War
field of Los Altos was very reassuring. She said that nothing
would hurt and that blood giving was a cinch."


!j. "Here I am leaving. After a
10-mimite rest I had a eup <»f
coffee and a doughnut in the fled
Cross and student canteen. Gee,
they treat you nice here and it
sure was simple,' a man from
Palo Alto commented. I agreed
with him. Giving blood makes
you feel useful. In fact, it's a
great feeling."


4. "Don't ho alarmed. It's my arm
and my hlood. hut the rest of the
picture was so horrible that we
cut it off. The hlood - giving
process itself took about 15 min
utes. The area around my fore
arm joint was anaesthetized with
< m
novocain and (hen the minute
needle inserted. No strain, no
pain. I didn't fill up a whole pint
bottle, but the nurse told me that
it was a 'successful pint' because
it was filled over half-way."
