## A
						GROWING FIELD— Instrumentation Modern manufacturing trends at Du Pont bring ever-increasing opportunities for technical men 
### 
Do you think of instrumentation as
applying only to work in electricity
and electronics?
Or would you also include prob
lems in chemical processing, mate
rials of construction and materials
handling, as well as application of
equipment — both mechanical and
hydraulic—for measurement and
control systems?
At Du Pont, instrumentation is
applied to widely diverse areas of
manufacturing operations. Itcalls for
many different technical back
grounds. In a typical instrument
group there may be men whose formal
training has been in mechanical,
chemical, electrical or metallurgical
engineering, or in physics, etc.

Instrumentation is becoming more
and more important in the chemical
industry. In fact, many of today's
processes and products would not be
possible without modern measure
ment and control systems. The trend
toward continuous processes means
challenging and constantly increas
ing opportunities for instrumenta
tion men.
Du Pont's instrument program in
cludes research, development, design,
and supervising installation of proc
ess control equipment. Some of the
work is done in the central Engineer
ing Department at Wilmington.
However, most of the major plants
across the country now have their
own organized instrument groups.

So you may visualize the scope and
diversity of the work, here are ex
amples of instrumentation recently
developed and designed by Du Pont
technical men:
1. A device to measure flow of approxi
mately .'30,000 lbs. pt i r hour of gas at
more than 10,000 p.H.i. To give 1.2',
accuracy and he responsive to flow
changes of five cycles per second.
2. A device to monitor continuously
1200 similar temperatures. Equipment
to record temperature and sound alarm
ata deviation of 1 U C. from desired point.
3. An automatic control system to main
tain a predetermined pressure-tempera
ture relation in a large-batch autoclave
during spontaneous reaction between
two chemicals.
Thus it can be seen that Du Pont
instrumentation is limited to no single
avenue of engineering. Men with an
aptitude for the work get experience
in many phases of the Company's
technical activities—and an excellent
background for positions in manage
ment and administration.
