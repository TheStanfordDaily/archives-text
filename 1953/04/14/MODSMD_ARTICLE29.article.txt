### 
Although Stanford's (rack team lost to Troy, Stanford athletes managed
to win eleven of fourteen events on the Farm last weekend. In fact, a look
at Varsity spring sports to date shows an impressive .'IX won, l.'llost record.
*
Boh Mathias was held to a mere two points in last Saturday's Trojan track
meet not by the Trojan aces, but by a bad back. The two-time Olympic
champ pulled a muscle in his first broad-jump. It didn't affect him much
in the field events, but the up and down motion of the hurdles was too much
for him. He ran a "slow" : 14.7 flight of hit»hs which was only food for fourth
in the star-studded event, and he was unable to enter the lowa.
As for action Saturday against UCLA. Bob thinks he'll be able to enter
the field events, but will probably stay out of the hurdles. He once received
the identical in jury in football and reports that it took about a week to heal.
While we're on the subject of track, here's a belated bow to Stanford's
Bob Simon. The blood drive forced nows of Simon's twin triumnh against
Troy to be cut out, but the willowy distance ace showed real nerve in win
ning an easy 4:19.5 mile (with a 60-second last lap), a 1:55.2 half mile and
then attempting an unheard of triple distance win by entering the grueling
two mile grind.
* * *
Ex-Stanford pitcher Rog Osenhaugh showed his best form of his pro
career as he shut out Portland Sunday on* two hits. Osenhaugh had a
rough year with the Solons last year, hut the red-haired fire-haller looked
like a real big leaguer yesterday. lie pitched hitless hall from the third
inning on.
The other half of the Cards' fine pitching duo of last year, Joe Chez, has
been finding the going a little rougher this year. His record is none won,
three lost for Oakland, but he has been pitching far better ball than his
record would indicate and should hit the win trail soon.
* * *
Stanford's baseballers gained the easy way in the CIBA race last week
as Cal and USC, the league's two cellar teams handed double drubbings
to Santa Clara and UCLA, the two teams figured to give the Cards most
trouble this year. •
Its obvious that the Cards will be able to lose four or five and still win the
flag, and with Bob Murphy finding top form after three years of hot and cold
pitching, the Cards look like a shoo-in for the flag.
This may make May 29 and 30 a great sports weekend for sports fans.
The PCC track finals will be held May 30 in the Stadium and the CIBA
pennant winner is going to host the Northern Division champ for the right
to go to the NCAA tournament on the 29th, 30th. and 31st.
* * *
Anything can happen in baseball, however. Consider the case of UCLA's
Dick Gilson. Gilson looked like Rddie Lopat as he nothing-balled his
way to a three-hitter and handed Stanford their lone CIBA setback two
weeks ago.
Last weekend he relieved in both the games between UCLA and the
cellar-dwelling USC Troians. He was unable to last the inning cither
game and he got tagged for six runs in an inning and one-third of pitching.

Stanford's official football schedule, released this week, shows six home
games. They will also attempt to avenge last year's Rose Bowl when they
meet Illinois at Champaign October 3.

Ex-Stanford pitcher Rog Osenhaugh showed his best form of his pro
career as he shut out Portland Sunday on* two hits. Osenhaugh had a
rough year with the Solons last year, hut the red-haired fire-haller looked
like a real big leaguer yesterday. lie pitched hitless hall from the third
inning on.
The other half of the Cards' fine pitching duo of last year, Joe Chez, has
been finding the going a little rougher this year. His record is none won,
three lost for Oakland, but he has been pitching far better ball than his
record would indicate and should hit the win trail soon.

Stanford's baseballers gained the easy way in the CIBA race last week
as Cal and USC, the league's two cellar teams handed double drubbings
to Santa Clara and UCLA, the two teams figured to give the Cards most
trouble this year. •
Its obvious that the Cards will be able to lose four or five and still win the
flag, and with Bob Murphy finding top form after three years of hot and cold
pitching, the Cards look like a shoo-in for the flag.
This may make May 29 and 30 a great sports weekend for sports fans.
The PCC track finals will be held May 30 in the Stadium and the CIBA
pennant winner is going to host the Northern Division champ for the right
to go to the NCAA tournament on the 29th, 30th. and 31st.

Anything can happen in baseball, however. Consider the case of UCLA's
Dick Gilson. Gilson looked like Rddie Lopat as he nothing-balled his
way to a three-hitter and handed Stanford their lone CIBA setback two
weeks ago.
Last weekend he relieved in both the games between UCLA and the
cellar-dwelling USC Troians. He was unable to last the inning cither
game and he got tagged for six runs in an inning and one-third of pitching.

Stanford's official football schedule, released this week, shows six home
games. They will also attempt to avenge last year's Rose Bowl when they
meet Illinois at Champaign October 3.
The schedule:

Sept. 26- Oregon Oct. 31—WSC
Oct. 3—lllinois at Champaign Nov. 7—USC at Los Angeles
Oct. 10—OSC at Portland Nov. 14—San Jose State

Although Stanford's (rack team lost to Troy, Stanford athletes managed
to win eleven of fourteen events on the Farm last weekend. In fact, a look
at Varsity spring sports to date shows an impressive .'IX won, l.'llost record.

Boh Mathias was held to a mere two points in last Saturday's Trojan track
meet not by the Trojan aces, but by a bad back. The two-time Olympic
champ pulled a muscle in his first broad-jump. It didn't affect him much
in the field events, but the up and down motion of the hurdles was too much
for him. He ran a "slow" : 14.7 flight of hit»hs which was only food for fourth
in the star-studded event, and he was unable to enter the lowa.
As for action Saturday against UCLA. Bob thinks he'll be able to enter
the field events, but will probably stay out of the hurdles. He once received
the identical in jury in football and reports that it took about a week to heal.
While we're on the subject of track, here's a belated bow to Stanford's
Bob Simon. The blood drive forced nows of Simon's twin triumnh against
Troy to be cut out, but the willowy distance ace showed real nerve in win
ning an easy 4:19.5 mile (with a 60-second last lap), a 1:55.2 half mile and
then attempting an unheard of triple distance win by entering the grueling
two mile grind.
