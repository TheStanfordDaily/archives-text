### 
WASHINGTON Sen. Joseph R.
McCarthy disclosed today that his
Permanent" Senate Investigating
subcommittee is looking into all
payments to newspapers, magazines,
and other "information media" by
government agencies during the
past live years.
The Wisconsin Republican said he
is interested primarily in any "sub
sidy" that might have been paid to
any Individual or organization for
favorable treatment of the Truman
administration.
McCarthy told reporters the in
quiry is an outgrowth of his inves
tigation of the State Department's
overseas information program. He
has asked the information ageney
for records on what it paid to news
papers, magazines, radio networks,
and writers for material used in its
programs.
McCarthy said he wanted to get a
"rough picture" of such government

expenditures over the past five
years but does not expeet to demand
detailed records for that far back.
McCarthy denied that the inquiry
was an "investigation of the press."
