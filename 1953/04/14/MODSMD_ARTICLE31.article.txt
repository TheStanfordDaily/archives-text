# Tight Battle Slated in NL
## 
### 
The curtain rose on the 76th ma
! jor league baseball season yester
day as Milwaukee, wiih ex-Sacra
i mento Solon Max Surkont pitching,
shut out Cincinnati, 2 to 0.
In the American League, the Yan
i kees are trying for an unprecedent
-1 filth pennant in a row. Neither
i tha Indian pitching nor the White
| Sox speed appears capable of keep
; ing the Bomber;, from the flag. The
Yanks' Mickey Mantle may blossom
into one of baseball's all-time best
this year.
The National League race shapes

,up as a great four-team race. Much
S depends on the performance of
rookies Junior Gilliam of Brooklyn
and Daryl Spencer of the Giants,
but more depends on how such vet
i erans as Jackie Robinson, Preacher
; Roe, Larry Jan en, Sal Maglie. and
Country Slaughter hold up. Keep
an eye on the Phillies, who played
; the best ball in the league during
the last half of 1952 and who are
the only team without any tired oid
| veterans to worry about.â€”M. H.
