# Shocked Daily Shack Gets Spring Cleaning
## 
### 
'"There must be an easier way to
be promoted," mused five Daily
neophytes who Saturday gave the
Daily Shack Its first spring clean

The five disproved an old theory
when they discovered the Daily
floor beneath the layers of cigarette
butts, dust, and old wire editors.
Daily contributors and tryoutees
are invited to inspect the newly

paper.
