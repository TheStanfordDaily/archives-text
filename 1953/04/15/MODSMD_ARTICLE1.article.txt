BOUND FOR KOREA—Airmen load Stanford blood on a Mili
tary Air Transport, which will take it to Travis Air Force Base
for pre-Korean processing. Only the type "O" blood goes to
Korea whole; the other types are made into plasma and serum

albumin, also used in the Korean fighting. The need for blood
is expected to be acute in Korea this week due to the release
by the Communists of sick and wounded prisoners of war.
