# Model UN Opens Today
## 
### 
Thirteen delegates and nine ob
servers will represent the United
Kingdom in the Model U.N. to be
held on the Berkeley campus today
through Sunday.
The Stanford students expect to
have several key issues thrown at
them during the conference. The
Kenya problem will undoubtedly
come up for discussion, in the opin
ion of Ted Lamb, delegation chair
man. Other problems facing the
world now which arc expected to
turn up at the conference arc those
involved in the peace talks now in
session in Korea.
The admission of new members
to the United Nalrions will probably
provoke many arguments and tem
per. as the United Kingdom (Stan
ford) and the United States (USC)
oppose the measures favored by
Russia (Cal).
Stanford's nine observers will be:
Art Alexander, Beglan Birand, Don
Crow, Rosemary Duggin, Bobbie
Trattner, Melba Mamija, Bill Moore,
Barbara Nelson, and Mary Vaughn.
