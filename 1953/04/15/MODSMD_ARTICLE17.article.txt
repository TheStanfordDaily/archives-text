3,230 pints still needed to reach its 5,000-pint goal.

ment" by J. Pearce Mitchell, mayor
of Palo Alto and chairman of the
local Red Cross chapter.
And some of the blood collected

there it will be sped to Travis Air
base for processing and quick ship
ment to the war area.
Unlike Monday, some students

Stanford's mammoth blood drive enters its third day today with
3,230 pints still needed to reach its 5,000-pint goal.
Though Stanford missed breaking the 1,167-pint one-day record

set by Soledad Prison, yesterday's
total was deemed "a great, achieve--
ment" by J. Pearce Mitchell, mayor
of Palo Alto and chairman of the
local Red Cross chapter.
And some of the blood collected
yesterday was rushed, in a special,
life-6aving airlift, to the Korean
front. The blood, particularly "O"
type, was picked up by helicopter
and flown to Moffett Field. From
there it will be sped to Travis Air
base for processing and quick ship
ment to the war area.
Unlike Monday, some students
had to waty 1° give. The slow
down in the process was due to
an unexpected number of drop
ins and the Red Cross's policy of
putting the donors' safety first.

close of yesterday's donations to
discuss cutting down donor waiting.
