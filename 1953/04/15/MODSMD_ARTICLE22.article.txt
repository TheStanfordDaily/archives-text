# Wauled: Student Leaders
## 
### 
"There is a potential student body president
under every bush at Stanford," stated a promi
nent administration official at the 'Y' Leadership
Conference last quarter.
But from the looks of the nomination list for
the student body's top job as well as the other
offices up for election the bushes must be
crowded; certainly the nominations are not.
Since it admits students with outstanding
leadership and activity records, Stanford can
justifiably expect a good return in student lead
ers. But student government is far from a one
way operation—the officers themselves benefit
from their experience in organization, money
handling, and plain getting along with people,
not to mention valuable recommendations to
employers later on.

Obviously, it takes a particularly gifted stu
dent to be student body president. He must be
able to think quickly, make reasoned decisions
and stick by them, and hold together contro
versial Excom meetings, besides representing
Stanford to the outside world. >
The other offices now open also demand
above-average personnel—the ASSU vice-pres
ident who co-ordinates campus activities, the
class offices, Men's and Women's Councils,
and other key representatives.
Why have only a few students considered
their school and themselves? We urge our po
tential student leaders to come out from the
bushes —nominations close today.
