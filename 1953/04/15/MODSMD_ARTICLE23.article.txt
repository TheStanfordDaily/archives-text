# BULL SESSION
## 
### DICK McLEAN 
(Ed. Nolo: The following Hull Session was written
by Dick McClean, '52, just alter he had given blood
in the spring of 1952).
"There's nothing to it," you .say as you sign the
blank for an appointment time to give blood. "Nothing
to it. i-t all."
The slight-looking girl standing behind you in line
nods in silent agreement. She signs for an appoint
ment and then asks you, "Have you given before?"

"Yes, yes, several times," you
lie with the greatest bravado. "Al
most every week."
"Every week!" she exclaims.
"But you're only supposed to give
every three months."
"Well . . . (Come on mind.
Work.) . . . Yes, the first week
of every third month. Just like
I said. Every first week." But
the prickly redness creeps up
around your ears.

"What type of blood do you have?" she asks
You nearly say "red" but instead you stammer,
"Oh . . . oh . . ."
"That's nice," she says,"I have type 'O' too. I see
that we have appointments at about the same time.
I'll see you there." While the little coed jaunts off, you
eye her frame. (It's an old habit). But this time you
calculate that you own about twice as much blood us
she.
"Wednesday at 4 o'clock," the appointment slip says.
Time like death, midterms, finals, graduation, and
the army creeps ever onward toward you. Forgetting
that marvelous process which has kept you from
giving blood and remembering dentist appointments
on other occasions doesn't seem to function.
"Wednesday at 4 o'clock."
On The Morning you wake up disgustingly healthy.
Not a sign of a cold. Not even a sniffle.
"Nothing to it," you whisper reassuringly to your
s< 11 in the mirror as you shave. But you nick yourself
and the drop of blood on your chin turns your face as
white as the shaving lather.
Toward afternoon voy begin to seek company for
the ordeal. You find one fellow who'll come along.
(Even if you haven't made an appointment they can
<ift«'ii slij> you in). "Will you promise me something,

Art, old friend?" you ask. "If I should faint or any
thing, you won't let them carry me out the front
door."
"Don't worry, lad. Your old dad will take care of
you," Art says.
At 4 o'clock you go down to the Pavilion. There's
room for both you and your portly friend. For a while
you sit in one chair and then move alohg to another.
It's like musil-al chairs only no one is left out.
You kid the nurse, intimating that you're an old
hand at this giving blood business. She takes the
ribbing only so long and then slaps a thermometer
in your mouth.
"Humgt . . . Glur . . you quip to your buddy
who doesn't understand you. You roll the glass stick
around in your mouth like the last piece of ice in a
drink. But you mustn't bite.
From the temperature line you move to the table for
hemoglobin and blood pressure tests. "Are you ner
vous?" the pretty lady in gray asks.
"No, not at all," you say cracking your knuckles.
She pricks the end of your finger and takes a drop
of blood. It's red all right. Then she wraps your arm
and takes your blood pressure. She takes it twice.
"Oh no, you're not nervous," she cracks as the gauge
bounces up to 200. "You should get a cigar for ring
ing the bell."
"Will you follow me?" another lady says. You wave
a sad "goodbye" to your blond buddy who's trying to
get a date with the blood pressure nurse. (He likes
older women).
You lie down on one of the beds and take tight
hold of yourself to await the surge of pain. But it
doesn't come. The nurse touches your arm with a
novocain needle. It barely pierces the skin and yet
deadens the whole area. If you don't watch, you
never know when the plasma needle is inserted. No
fuss, no muss, no pain. You're almost disappointed.
In about X minutes you're all through. You're one
pint of blood lighter and never feel it.
Over coffee and doughnuts with the other "veterans"
you laugh at the frightened people who haven't "given"
yet. You haven't eaten for four hours so the stufl tastes
especially good.
"How was it?" someone asks on the way out.
"Nothing to it. Nothing to it at all." And you feel
glad that it's over and also something else. Almost
as if you'd done something important.

"No, not at all," you say cracking your knuckles.
She pricks the end of your finger and takes a drop
of blood. It's red all right. Then she wraps your arm
and takes your blood pressure. She takes it twice.
"Oh no, you're not nervous," she cracks as the gauge
bounces up to 200. "You should get a cigar for ring
ing the bell."
"Will you follow me?" another lady says. You wave
a sad "goodbye" to your blond buddy who's trying to
get a date with the blood pressure nurse. (He likes
older women).
You lie down on one of the beds and take tight
hold of yourself to await the surge of pain. But it
doesn't come. The nurse touches your arm with a
novocain needle. It barely pierces the skin and yet
deadens the whole area. If you don't watch, you
never know when the plasma needle is inserted. No
fuss, no muss, no pain. You're almost disappointed.
In about X minutes you're all through. You're one
pint of blood lighter and never feel it.
Over coffee and doughnuts with the other "veterans"
you laugh at the frightened people who haven't "given"
yet. You haven't eaten for four hours so the stufl tastes
especially good.
"How was it?" someone asks on the way out.
"Nothing to it. Nothing to it at all." And you feel
glad that it's over and also something else. Almost
as if you'd done something important.

(Ed. Nolo: The following Hull Session was written
by Dick McClean, '52, just alter he had given blood
in the spring of 1952).
"There's nothing to it," you .say as you sign the
blank for an appointment time to give blood. "Nothing
to it. i-t all."
The slight-looking girl standing behind you in line
nods in silent agreement. She signs for an appoint
ment and then asks you, "Have you given before?"

"Yes, yes, several times," you
lie with the greatest bravado. "Al
most every week."
"Every week!" she exclaims.
"But you're only supposed to give
every three months."
"Well . . . (Come on mind.
Work.) . . . Yes, the first week
of every third month. Just like
I said. Every first week." But
the prickly redness creeps up
around your ears.

"What type of blood do you have?" she asks
You nearly say "red" but instead you stammer,
"Oh . . . oh . . ."
"That's nice," she says,"I have type 'O' too. I see
that we have appointments at about the same time.
I'll see you there." While the little coed jaunts off, you
eye her frame. (It's an old habit). But this time you
calculate that you own about twice as much blood us
she.
"Wednesday at 4 o'clock," the appointment slip says.
Time like death, midterms, finals, graduation, and
the army creeps ever onward toward you. Forgetting
that marvelous process which has kept you from
giving blood and remembering dentist appointments
on other occasions doesn't seem to function.
"Wednesday at 4 o'clock."
On The Morning you wake up disgustingly healthy.
Not a sign of a cold. Not even a sniffle.
"Nothing to it," you whisper reassuringly to your
s< 11 in the mirror as you shave. But you nick yourself
and the drop of blood on your chin turns your face as
white as the shaving lather.
Toward afternoon voy begin to seek company for
the ordeal. You find one fellow who'll come along.
(Even if you haven't made an appointment they can
<ift«'ii slij> you in). "Will you promise me something,

Art, old friend?" you ask. "If I should faint or any
thing, you won't let them carry me out the front
door."
"Don't worry, lad. Your old dad will take care of
you," Art says.
At 4 o'clock you go down to the Pavilion. There's
room for both you and your portly friend. For a while
you sit in one chair and then move alohg to another.
It's like musil-al chairs only no one is left out.
You kid the nurse, intimating that you're an old
hand at this giving blood business. She takes the
ribbing only so long and then slaps a thermometer
in your mouth.
"Humgt . . . Glur . . you quip to your buddy
who doesn't understand you. You roll the glass stick
around in your mouth like the last piece of ice in a
drink. But you mustn't bite.
From the temperature line you move to the table for
hemoglobin and blood pressure tests. "Are you ner

Not a sign of a cold. Not even a sniffle.
"Nothing to it," you whisper reassuringly to your
s< 11 in the mirror as you shave. But you nick yourself
and the drop of blood on your chin turns your face as
white as the shaving lather.
Toward afternoon voy begin to seek company for
the ordeal. You find one fellow who'll come along.
(Even if you haven't made an appointment they can
<ift«'ii slij> you in). "Will you promise me something,

Art, old friend?" you ask. "If I should faint or any
thing, you won't let them carry me out the front
door."
"Don't worry, lad. Your old dad will take care of
you," Art says.
At 4 o'clock you go down to the Pavilion. There's
room for both you and your portly friend. For a while
you sit in one chair and then move alohg to another.
It's like musil-al chairs only no one is left out.
You kid the nurse, intimating that you're an old
hand at this giving blood business. She takes the
ribbing only so long and then slaps a thermometer
in your mouth.
"Humgt . . . Glur . . you quip to your buddy
who doesn't understand you. You roll the glass stick
around in your mouth like the last piece of ice in a
drink. But you mustn't bite.
From the temperature line you move to the table for
hemoglobin and blood pressure tests. "Are you ner
vous?" the pretty lady in gray asks.
"No, not at all," you say cracking your knuckles.
She pricks the end of your finger and takes a drop
of blood. It's red all right. Then she wraps your arm
and takes your blood pressure. She takes it twice.
"Oh no, you're not nervous," she cracks as the gauge
bounces up to 200. "You should get a cigar for ring
ing the bell."
"Will you follow me?" another lady says. You wave
a sad "goodbye" to your blond buddy who's trying to
get a date with the blood pressure nurse. (He likes
older women).
You lie down on one of the beds and take tight
hold of yourself to await the surge of pain. But it
doesn't come. The nurse touches your arm with a
novocain needle. It barely pierces the skin and yet
deadens the whole area. If you don't watch, you
never know when the plasma needle is inserted. No
fuss, no muss, no pain. You're almost disappointed.
In about X minutes you're all through. You're one
pint of blood lighter and never feel it.
Over coffee and doughnuts with the other "veterans"
you laugh at the frightened people who haven't "given"
yet. You haven't eaten for four hours so the stufl tastes
especially good.
"How was it?" someone asks on the way out.
"Nothing to it. Nothing to it at all." And you feel
glad that it's over and also something else. Almost
as if you'd done something important.

(Ed. Nolo: The following Hull Session was written
by Dick McClean, '52, just alter he had given blood
in the spring of 1952).
"There's nothing to it," you .say as you sign the
blank for an appointment time to give blood. "Nothing
to it. i-t all."
The slight-looking girl standing behind you in line
nods in silent agreement. She signs for an appoint
ment and then asks you, "Have you given before?"

"Yes, yes, several times," you
lie with the greatest bravado. "Al
most every week."
"Every week!" she exclaims.
"But you're only supposed to give
every three months."
"Well . . . (Come on mind.
Work.) . . . Yes, the first week
of every third month. Just like
I said. Every first week." But
the prickly redness creeps up
around your ears.

"What type of blood do you have?" she asks
You nearly say "red" but instead you stammer,
"Oh . . . oh . . ."
"That's nice," she says,"I have type 'O' too. I see
that we have appointments at about the same time.
I'll see you there." While the little coed jaunts off, you
eye her frame. (It's an old habit). But this time you
calculate that you own about twice as much blood us
she.
"Wednesday at 4 o'clock," the appointment slip says.
Time like death, midterms, finals, graduation, and
the army creeps ever onward toward you. Forgetting
that marvelous process which has kept you from
giving blood and remembering dentist appointments
on other occasions doesn't seem to function.
