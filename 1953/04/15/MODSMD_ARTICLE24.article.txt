# CAMPUS OPINION
## 'Irrational and Cowardly Caliber'? 
### 
To the Editor:
I'm a member of the Freshman class — the one
which in 1956 will provide the leadership in social
and scholastic activities which will keep Stanford's
high standing among all American universities. That
is, my class will give this leadership providing that
it i' first filled with the spirit to do so. feels a need to
continue a tradition of outstanding activity.
I am afraid, however, that I must admit to a great
doubt that this class of TiG will be able to provide the
soil of leadership which is demanded.
And now you ask, "Why?" Il is because of the
EXAMPLE set heforfc us by the entire University
of the LACK of spirit for anything of apparent im
portance on the part not only of the masses of
students but their selected leaders and faculty.
What spirit do I think necessary? I think it is fairly
obvious that the need consists a spirit of intel
b dual broadmindedness, a show of some moral
bravery, and a mental capacity to act rationally.
And you say, "Why am I so sure that this spirit is
\o la< king'' I have become aware of this lack sud
denly and really shockingly -because of one set of
<in 1 To put it bluntly, the Blood Drive.
Tht reason? which over 3,000 students hold lot not
donating blood arc what fill me with antipathy about
o.' l»:id' r'hip of thi I'ioup of Indents Consider a
moment the three main re.Mons held by those who
refill to contribute;

1 Fear. at it! The incongruity of fear on the
part of the donor when considered in the light of
the experiences endured by those for whom theyjire'
donating is too apparent to be iurther explored.
2. Disapproval of the Korean War. Do you also
hold a disapproval of human life?
11. Intolerance based on racial and ideological dif
ferences. 1 believe you us a rational person will find
your vocabulary will fall short of expressing the full
contempt ol which such prejudice is worthy.
Now is il clear why I doubt the spirit in us which
can make us lead? Fifteen per cent of the faculty
have signed up to donate. As big as we are as col
lege students I do not feel that we are beyond the
point where we respect actions of those who
instruct us. and yet they do this.
Over half the Stanford boys have decided not to
give their blood. (And we are requested at this
point to remember that the reason they are Stan
ford boys and not fighting men is their superior in
telligence).
Well, I have stated my case. When I find that out
of 7.000 highly selected individuals there are still
almost 4,000 of an irrational, prejudiced and cowardly
caliber, I am inclined to sit back, pen in hand, and re
mark verbally on the futility of my class or any
class trying in any way to lead these people toward
any sort of higher goal.

continue a tradition of outstanding activity.
I am afraid, however, that I must admit to a great
doubt that this class of TiG will be able to provide the
soil of leadership which is demanded.
And now you ask, "Why?" Il is because of the
EXAMPLE set heforfc us by the entire University
of the LACK of spirit for anything of apparent im
portance on the part not only of the masses of
students but their selected leaders and faculty.
What spirit do I think necessary? I think it is fairly
obvious that the need consists a spirit of intel
b dual broadmindedness, a show of some moral
bravery, and a mental capacity to act rationally.
And you say, "Why am I so sure that this spirit is
\o la< king'' I have become aware of this lack sud
denly and really shockingly -because of one set of
<in 1 To put it bluntly, the Blood Drive.
Tht reason? which over 3,000 students hold lot not
donating blood arc what fill me with antipathy about
o.' l»:id' r'hip of thi I'ioup of Indents Consider a
moment the three main re.Mons held by those who
refill to contribute;

1 Fear. at it! The incongruity of fear on the
part of the donor when considered in the light of
the experiences endured by those for whom theyjire'
donating is too apparent to be iurther explored.
2. Disapproval of the Korean War. Do you also
hold a disapproval of human life?
11. Intolerance based on racial and ideological dif
ferences. 1 believe you us a rational person will find
your vocabulary will fall short of expressing the full
contempt ol which such prejudice is worthy.
Now is il clear why I doubt the spirit in us which
can make us lead? Fifteen per cent of the faculty
have signed up to donate. As big as we are as col
lege students I do not feel that we are beyond the
point where we respect actions of those who
instruct us. and yet they do this.
Over half the Stanford boys have decided not to
give their blood. (And we are requested at this
point to remember that the reason they are Stan
ford boys and not fighting men is their superior in
telligence).
Well, I have stated my case. When I find that out
of 7.000 highly selected individuals there are still
almost 4,000 of an irrational, prejudiced and cowardly
caliber, I am inclined to sit back, pen in hand, and re
mark verbally on the futility of my class or any
class trying in any way to lead these people toward
any sort of higher goal.
