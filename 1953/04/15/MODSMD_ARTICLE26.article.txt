income which Stanford uses to
pay its bills, and one which it has
come to rely on more heavily in
recent years, is the annual total

the University by both private
individuals and organizations.
Last year the University received
over $1,890,000 in gifts and bequests
for current use, and for the first six
months of this school year $1,039,000
has been received. Such high fig

the second World War there existed
no conscious, well - organized at
