Tomorrow" articles which the

Stanford University is not just
a well-shaded, rambling campus
housing 7,000 students, exten
sive intellectual activity, and a
happy-go-lucky social program.
It is a business.
It is an institution with a yearly
operating budget of $11,500,000.
It is an organization with prob
lems of financing approaching those
of a major industrial corporation.
How is this University of build
ings and budgets and facilities and
fiscal reports financed?
The yearly financial statements
of the University list three major
sources of income: tuition and
fees, endowment income, and ex
pendable gifts and bequests.
A freshman entering Stanford will
learn from the Frosh Bible and re
ports by welcoming committees that
each student's tuition pays only
half the cost of his education. This
"education" is in reality tlpe yearly
cost of operating the University, a
cost which in the school year 1951
to 1952 amounted to $11,433,000.
The payment of tuition and fees
for that year came to $4,792,000, or
approximately 41 per cent of the
total expenditures. Subtracting the
$3,000,000 extended to the Univer
sity for government research proj
ects, tuition payments come closer
to that "50 per cent of cost" fresh
men hear about.
The yield on Stanford's endow
ment, the University's permanently
invested capital, and gifts and be
quests for the University's opera
tion from alumni and friends pro
vide the .major portion of the "other
half" of the income needed to meet
expenditures.
Stanford's present endowment
is $43,616,000. Since the Univer
sity's founding when Senator
Stanford contributed the original
$21,000,000 endowment, the figure
has been doubled primarily as a
result of gifts, mostly from Stan
ford gra«ls. Last year, for exam
ple, Stanford received $1,409,000
in ftifts to the endowment. In the
first six months of this school
year, such gifts have totaled
$666,000.
Additional increases have been
accumulated from endowment in
come that has been reinvested.
The endowment income, $1,843,000
last year, is the result of extensive
investment handled both by the
University officials and by banks
under contract to Stanford. The av
erage return on investment of en
dowment funds last year was. 4.54
per cent.
Each dollar of the endowment
is invested with the intention of
the greatest possible financial re
turn to the University, with the
exception of University buildings
and dorms, which are run on a
non-profit basis.
Until 1936 when the government
excercised a "prudent man rule"
permitting private schools to invest
funds in whatever way they choose,
most of Stanford's funds were in
vested in railroad bonds. Since then,
the endowment has been reinvested
until today almost 40 per cent is
held in government, bonds. Tens of
thousands of dollars are also held in
common stocks of public utilities,
fire insurance, banks, oil, chemicals,
and (a small amount) railroads.
The endowment, the '4estate" of
the University, is never "dipped
into," University officials will stress.
