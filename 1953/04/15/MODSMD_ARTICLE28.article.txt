### BARBARA TUERK 
TIIE MACHINE AGE The Uni
versity of California, already re
nowned for a fruit-juice vending
machine in the ASUC store and a
coffee dispenser in the men's club
rooms, is now rumored dickering
for a pure oxygen machine. Accord
ing to the Daily Californian the
mechanical miracle, already used in
other places to pep up tired athletes
and cure hangovers, might be just
what the students need for finals.

EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVI
TIES—RED FASHION All stu
dents of the Law Faculty of Leip
zig University in the East German
Zone are now compulsory members
of the "Society for Sports and Tech
nics." They are detailed into bodies

CALL A SPADE A SPADE—Din
ers at the University of Washing
ton's student union, the Hub, sur
prised cafeteria workers recently by
their guffaws at the menu listed on
the wall of their cafeteria recently.
"Finally got around to serving
horse meat, did you?" one student
finally observed ty a befuddled
worker.
The mystery was solved when the
worker walked in front of the coun
ter to discover an extra "s" in front
of the "table steak."
PARLEZ-VGUS VVINO?—SC lec
turer Hartley Batey did his home

work too well last week. He was so
busy preparing to give a "Discourse
on Wine" before the French group's
Parlez - vous Rendezvous meeting
that he never got there. Later he
agreed to try to give the talk again
— after some "additional experi
mentation" with his topic.

ADDITION —The USF Chronicle
announced recently that because so
many bids had been sold in ad
vance, "several additional" mem
bers would be added to the band
for the Barristers' Ball. The next
week they announced that the new
members had been added. Present
total: lour.

END OF DISCRIMINATION BY
1960?—The student council at Rut
gers University last week began
publicizing a recommendation that
all universities collaborate to ban
from their campuses any organiza
tions with written forms of discrim
ination in' their constitutions. They
proposed 1960 as a date for the
elimination.
Rutgers hoped that a nation-wide
attack on discrimination would les
sen the pressure against local
groups now forced to choose be
tween bre'aking national constitu
tions or being expelled from cam
puses which have passed local anti
discrimination laws.

THE PLUTOCRATS —A unique
rainstorm of orchids fell on the
University of Oregon campus re
cently. It wasn't manna from heav
en, just publicity for a Phi Kap
dance that weekend.
