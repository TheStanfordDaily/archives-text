## 
### PHIL HERMAN 
Coach Everett Dean's baseballers
Hot a bad one out ol their system
yesterday as they dropped a loosely
played 10 to 7 decision to the San
Jose Red Sox of the California
I league.
The setback, the second in two
days for the Indians, featured seven
hin lers of varying degrees oi effec
tiveness trudging to the mound, 22
hits, and nine errors.
Only left-hander Phil.Page. .the
first of a quartet of Cardinal
pitchers, escaped the wrath of the
JoSox hatters and the Stanford
fielders.
Ken Brown, Don DeLong, and
Mike Acker followed Page to the
hill and surrendered all the S :n
Jose runs.
Bo Palica, late of the Sacramento
Solons, ClilT Allman, and Jack Os
born all hurled for the Red Sox,
with Palica and Osborn turnin.' in
good performances.
Stanford led only briefly in the
ncar-three-hour allair. Singles by
Mai Hennacy, llog Irvine, War
ren Goodrich, Al Talboy, and a
throwing error gave them a
lead in the bottom of the third.
In the top of the fourth, how
ever, the roof fell in on Brown.
Four hits, including triples by
Marty Keough, $100,000 bonus play
er, and Eel Sobczak, plus a throw-

W
in • error by Brown himself, gave
San Jose five runs.
After the Red Sox had garnered
single runs in the sixth and seventh,
the Cards rallied to almost pull the
game out.
'Singles by Goodrich and Essegian
around Shepard's triple gave them
two markers n the last half of the
seventh.
Shen, in the bottom of the
eighth, Colo walked and Ilennacy
was safe on Allman's wild throw
to second. An infield hit by Good
rich brought in one run, and a
walk to Talboy loaded the bases.
Shepard knocked down third
baseman Nino Spatafore with a ter
rific line drive to bring in another
run.
Essegian, however, popped out to
end the rally and Stanford was
through for the afternoon.
Shepard, with a single and two
tremendous triples, hit consecutive
ly in the sixth and seventh innings,
led the Indians at the plate.
Keough, with a triple and two
ingles in four at-bats, and second
acker Harv Toso, who batted in
three runs, paced the JoSox.
