# Maloney Leads Card Shooters Over Cal Aggies
## 
### 
In a match that was not decided
until the last shot, the Stanford rifle
team Friday edged the California
Aggie shooters, 1.389 to 1,386, at
Davis. The win gave the Indian
marksmen undisputed possession of
third place in the Northern Califor
nia Intercollegiate Rifle Associa
tion.
The two teams were so close
throughout the match that it was
necessary for both captains to
check the targets before the final
score could be determined.
Captain Gerry Maloney, now
the second high scorer in the
Northern California League, de
feated the Aggies' Robert Hall in
the feature match. 292 to 279.
Other high point-makers lor the
Cards were Tom Murray with 285,
Monte Killingsworth with 273, John
Stahr with 271, and Ron Crawford
with 268.
The Indian shooters, who have
an 18 and 7 record for the year,
will conclude their season a week
from Friday in a match with
Santa Clara.
