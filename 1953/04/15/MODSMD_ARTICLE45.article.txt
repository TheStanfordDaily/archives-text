Stanford's Zeta chapter of Alpha
Phi Omega, national service frater
nity, initiated eight new members
—one of them, contrary to most
fraternity custom, a woman—at its
installation initiation banquet last
night at Bertrand's Oakwood Inn.
Elected to honorary membership
was Constance Libbey, who, in her
capacity as business manager of the
Daily, has often helped the frater
nity with its service projects. The
move to bring a woman into the
fraternal ranks is "unprecedented,"
a spokesman said.
Also initiated were Richard An
drews, Joe Van de Water, Don
Yates, Richard Mansfield, Allan
Hastings, and Lester Carlson. All

these are former Scouts, in accord
ance with the national fraternity's
constitution.
