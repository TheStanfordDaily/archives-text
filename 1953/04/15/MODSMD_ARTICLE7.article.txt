A final report to Excom on the
National Student Association will
be delayed another week, Student
Body President Dick Wcismann re
ported yesterday, but Excom will
consider other major topics at its
meeting tonight.
Among the key agenda topics
will be: (1) evaluation of the
Student - Faculty Political Com
mittee; (2) defunct organizations;
and (.'{) the possibility of organ
izing a House of Representatives
to sit as a lower house to Excom.
Though the meeting was origi
nally scheduled to be held in the
Branncr lobby, it will be held in

sion to one of the more populous
; dormitories.
Discussion of the controversial
NSA issue was postponed at the
request of Fran Kirk, chairman of
Excom's special committee investi
gating the student organization.
The House of Representatives
scheme, suggested at the last Ex
corn meeting by Student. Manager
