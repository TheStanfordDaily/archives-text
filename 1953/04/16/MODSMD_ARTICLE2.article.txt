TOKYO. Thursday, April 16 —
Communists poured battlefront sup
plies down the northwest Korea
"freedom route" yesterday under
the eyes of Allied airmen who dared
not shoot for fear of hitting convoys
carrying their own sick and wound
ed prisoners.
Communist anti-aircraft guns fired
at Allied planes that located two
prisoner convoys. There was no re
port that any were hit.
Pilots said the roads were jammed
with trucks and trailers. There was
even heavier than usual movement
of ox carts, bicycles, and people on
foot.
