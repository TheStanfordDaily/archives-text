### DICK MALTZMAN 
BLOODMANSHIP

All things being as they are, we full-fledged, life
men, game-iifemen, and game-lifemasters feel it our
duty to bring to the light of public attention a branch
organization to go under the name of Bloodmanship,
or the art of giving blood without actually letting.
The origins of bloodmanship can be traced back as

far as the eighth century. A vis
iting English professor at the
University of Paris, J. Barfing -
ton Forthright, was leading a
university summer tour to south
ern Spain (then held by the Mos
lems) when a student, Christian
E. Schrdlu, was taken ill with a
slight cold. Forthright, a blood
man from way back, attempted to
cure Christian by blood letting.
The blood was placed by Forth-

right in a jug to be taken back to France with the
body, but the blood was accidentally .spilled.
Forthright culled home to Paris, anil informed (he
officials that "Some imbecile has spilled Christian's
blood in Spain." The connection was had; they
thought he said, "The fufidels are spilling Christian
blood in Spain." This started the Crusades, which
were only ended when the French tour, heading
north, clashed with the Spanish tour, from the U.
of Madrid, heading south, in the famous Battle of
Tours in
I/i the present generation, .such large-scale gambits
are completely out of the question, but the experi
enced lifeman has many plotys at his disposal. He
has always given before and always looks assured..
When handed a cup of orange juice, he declines po
litely, pulls out his own clear glass, and pours him
self a shot of tomato juice from his hip flask.
The L. Pierre Screwdriver ploy of accepting the
orange juice and then adding a swig from a vodka
bottle or water (or vice versa) has its points (espe
cially the vice versa).
Be sure to tell all around you that you just got
out of bed with a 105-degree temperature to give

this blood, "but I remember how the Hell it was
over there when we were short of the stuff!" Don't
let on that the closest you have ever been to "over
there" is Catalina Island.
After they give you your bottle, go over to the
head nurse and ask her where the men's room is.
You can always say later that you thought this was
like your Army physical.
Across the doughnut table, calmly exclaim, "How
can you people drink milk through a straw after just
giving blood?"
Another popular ploy is pretending to he stuck
when she pins your pin on you and fainting dead
away. One person, who will be referred to only by
the fictitious name "Dan Wilbur," stopped by the
Pavilion to see how the drive was going, saw a
bottle being filled up, fainted, was mistaken for
dead, and before anyone could correct the error
they had eight pints out of him.
Once out, wear three pins, tape on both arms, and
walk with a limp to signify where the third pint
came from. Drink at least a fifth a day to give you that
"staggered look." Laugh at people who are afraid to
give, but faint whenever anyone mentions blood. You
might even carry an empty bottle around with you,
"in case I cut myself."
But all kidding aside— answer the questions of
(fit- form properly, and don't give if you have had
jaundice or the like. There was the case of the lady
in Cinncinatti who had a craving for yellow. She
painted her bedroom yellow, her ceiling yellow,
used yellow lights, had yellow tinted windows, yel
low carpets, yellow sheets, yellow blankets, and
a yellow nightgown. She got sick, was given blood
from someone who had yellow jaundice, got it
herself, and was never seen again.
Guts Bloodman of the Week Award again goes to
Ihe fictitious Mr. Wilbur. Dan, one of the chairmen of
the drive, cut himself slightly in the Cellar, dropped
his coffee, ran up three flights to the drive office,
wrote the word B-L-O-O-D with his own on a
poster, and rushed down to resume his c'Offee.
Sellsmanship ploy sell your pin for $2.00 to a
fellow bloodman.

BLOODMANSHIP

All things being as they are, we full-fledged, life
men, game-iifemen, and game-lifemasters feel it our
duty to bring to the light of public attention a branch
organization to go under the name of Bloodmanship,
or the art of giving blood without actually letting.
The origins of bloodmanship can be traced back as

far as the eighth century. A vis
iting English professor at the
University of Paris, J. Barfing -
ton Forthright, was leading a
university summer tour to south
ern Spain (then held by the Mos
lems) when a student, Christian
E. Schrdlu, was taken ill with a
slight cold. Forthright, a blood
man from way back, attempted to
cure Christian by blood letting.
The blood was placed by Forth-

right in a jug to be taken back to France with the
body, but the blood was accidentally .spilled.
Forthright culled home to Paris, anil informed (he
officials that "Some imbecile has spilled Christian's
blood in Spain." The connection was had; they
thought he said, "The fufidels are spilling Christian
blood in Spain." This started the Crusades, which
were only ended when the French tour, heading
north, clashed with the Spanish tour, from the U.
of Madrid, heading south, in the famous Battle of
Tours in
I/i the present generation, .such large-scale gambits
are completely out of the question, but the experi
enced lifeman has many plotys at his disposal. He
has always given before and always looks assured..
When handed a cup of orange juice, he declines po
litely, pulls out his own clear glass, and pours him
self a shot of tomato juice from his hip flask.
The L. Pierre Screwdriver ploy of accepting the
orange juice and then adding a swig from a vodka
bottle or water (or vice versa) has its points (espe
cially the vice versa).
Be sure to tell all around you that you just got
out of bed with a 105-degree temperature to give

this blood, "but I remember how the Hell it was
over there when we were short of the stuff!" Don't
let on that the closest you have ever been to "over
there" is Catalina Island.
After they give you your bottle, go over to the
head nurse and ask her where the men's room is.
You can always say later that you thought this was
like your Army physical.
Across the doughnut table, calmly exclaim, "How
can you people drink milk through a straw after just
giving blood?"
Another popular ploy is pretending to he stuck
when she pins your pin on you and fainting dead
away. One person, who will be referred to only by
the fictitious name "Dan Wilbur," stopped by the
Pavilion to see how the drive was going, saw a
bottle being filled up, fainted, was mistaken for
