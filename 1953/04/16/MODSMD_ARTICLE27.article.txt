# CAMPUS OPINION
## Reaction to the Sumner Case 'Basis Incompatible' 
### 
To the Editor:
The worth of Dr. Alfred R. Sumner is something
that can be measured, contrary to the opinion of the
administration. His worth is so great that it is
surprising, to this writer, that he was not retained
as a member of the Stanford faculty. A few facts
about the Geography Department will serve to il
lustrate what 1 mean. ,
Dr. White, head of the department, worked long
and well to earn for geographers at Stanford the
right to their own separate autonomy, fie has zeal
ously worked for the improvement of the quality of
the department's work.
However, knowing these to be his expressed am
bitions, it is perplexing indeed that he should allow
Dr. Sumner to leave. It must be generally agreed,
I think, that geography as a major department has
a very limited appeal to the average student. Since
Dr. Sumner has been in the department the enrol
lment has more than doubled. This quarter the en
rollment in geography classes has hit a new high,
and this with one of the members of the staff not
here. A man who can take important but dull facts
and make of them a vital, entrancing drama is cer
tainly a teacher among teachers, and, I venture to
say, the greatest reason for the genuine popularity
of geography courses.
Further, I might predict that next year, with
Sumner and White both gone, the enrollment in the
geography department will be less than half of what
it is now. »
Next, I would like to take what I assume was the
technical basis for failing to retain Dr. Sumner and
show how it is incompatible, at least with the name
Stanford has earned throughout the world. We are
called progressive—the leading school of the West—
and yet, when the consideration in question was to be
decided, we demonstrated a most irrational attitude.
If the law says that a man's option may be picked up
only if he has done sufficient research or publication,
then either we need clarification of the word research
(to include such things as TV programs!!) or we
need a new law which evaluates things in a more
dynamic, more progressive fashion.
