# Boards of Review
## 
### 
To the Editor:
We would like to agree with the Daily of April 13
that the failure to renew Dr. Sumner's contract is, to
say the least, regrettable. The situation has too

long been crippled by rumor and misunderstanding.
The Daily's report of the facts was clear and com
mendable. But we would like to question one aspect
of the Daily's editorial describing the situation.
Though we are very sorry that Dr. Sumner will
no longer be at Stanford, we are very glad that he
is the subject of this controversy because no mem
ber of the faculty has aroused more enthusiastic
student interest.
The Daily's description was concerned almost wholly
with the personal aspects of the situation. However,
we feel that these personal aspects are but a symptom
of a much larger problem, that of autocracy within
each department. To be constructive the question
should be related to the problem of policy within the
hierarchy of' every department.
As the president of a corporation is responsible to
the board of directors, so the head of a department
at Stanford should be responsible to a group of his
peers within related fields. To be more specific, we
suggest that boards of review be organized within
each school to which the heads of the departments
within the school would be responsible. These boards
would be a source of appeal, thus balancing the now
final power of the department head.
But whatever the ideas aroused by this controversy,
we feel that they should be evaluated on a basis of
mature idealism, that is, idealism governed by reason
able, non-personal criteria. Idealism without a real
istic coefficient is wasted.
Sincerely,
AUDREY WILLIAMS
