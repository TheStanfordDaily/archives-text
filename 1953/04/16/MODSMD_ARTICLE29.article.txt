To the Editor:
Stanford University has, notably, refrained from
hiring professional football players, in order to obtain
prestige and financial returns. Yet here is a case
of a University department "dropping" a professor
because he does not do enough research.
What is research, if not partially a measure of pres
tige ami financial return? What is the "end"of re
search? Human betterment? If so, is not the utili
zation of television as a medium of education a con
tributor to "human betterment?"
There is, I fear, little that can be done about the
present "injustice." But could not a faculty review
board be formed to prevent future "injustices?"
