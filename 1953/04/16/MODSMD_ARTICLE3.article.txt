# Bombs Scare Rally
## 
### 
BUENOS AIRES, April 15â€”Two
bombs were exploded today within
400 feet of President Juan D. Peron
as he addressed a rally of 100,000
persons from a balcony of Govern
ment House. Angered demonstra
tors put the torch to a Socialist
newspaper building, apparently in
retaliation.
The bomb blasts spread panic
through the cfowd in the Plaza dc
Mayo and there was a wild stam
pede for safety. There was no offi
cial report on casualties. However,
unofficial sources said four were
killed, 150 injured.
