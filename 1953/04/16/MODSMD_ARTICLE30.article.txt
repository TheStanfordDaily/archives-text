Stanford was unique among American universities because ft
didn't open its doors until its student residences were completed.
Roble Hall, now called Sequoia, housed the first entering women
students.
As enrollment increased, more residences were built. Women's

housing accommodations included a
new Roble, Union and Lagunita.
Then, during the war, Branner be
came a women's dormitory.
In 1944, sororities were disbanded
and the University took over the
houses on the Row. A student
tiousing committer was formed to
decide how women students would
be placed in Campus residences,
since a University rule states that
all single undergraduate women
under 23 must live on campus or
with their families.
