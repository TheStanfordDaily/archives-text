For several years now fans have been talking about having the Olympic
Games at Stanford . Usually these talks have been as much wishful thinking
as anything.
But the time has come to do some serious considering, for in the next few
weeks the site of the 195(> games will he decided. San Francisco is defi
nitely not out of the running yet. %
Over this next weekend, the Olympic Committee is meeting in Mexico
City to decide whether or not Australia will be able to handle the games.
Several well-informed officials doubt that this country will be able to pre
pare in time, so the site will be transferred.
It is then up to the United States to ban together and support a single
city for the games. At present sevbral cities, including Los Angeles,
Minneapolis, Detroit, Philadelphia, and San Francisco would like to have
the games. However, the committee is sure to give the games to Rome,
Buenos Aires, or some other foreign city if the United States officials
cannot agree among themselves which city they want. So the first step
lor San Francisco is to win approval among U.S. representatives.
One thing is certain: at this late date, the citv that takes the games
must have the FACILITIES to handle them. It is imposihle with only
three years notice to do what Helsinki did and construct almost an en
tire city.
Exactly where would the different events be held if San Francisco
did get the bid? Well, according to the present plans Stanford Stadium
would host the track events, which to most people is the meat of the
games. The basketball would be held in the Cow Palace, the equestrian
acts at Golden Gate Park. Rugby could be held in Kezar Stadium, and
of course the crew races on the bay. Other events such as archery, riflery
and weight lifting could be held just about anywhere, but San Francisco
would most likely like to keep as many of the events as possible within
the city limits. (Civic Auditorium, Golden Gate Park, Funston Field,
etc.).
However, one thing is certain: if San Francisco does get the bid, they
will have no choice as to where to hold the track events. Kezar would not
work, for it only lias 05,000 capacity, and because the gate receipts from
the track events support all of the other sports, the extra revenue would
be necessary. Besides, the Kezar running track is riot wide enough to
supply the necessary lanes. California's stadium, of course, has no run
ning track.
What changes would need to he made in Stanford's track to hold the
games? Two things: (1) the cuive at the north (closed) end of the
stadium would have to he widened slightly, (2) a new running surface
would need to he laid.
However, these changes are minor when it is remembered that Hel
sinki had to build an entire new stadium for the two-week event. Cities
competing for the games such as Philadelphia have one big handicap:
besides a regular stadium, a practice track (such as Angel! Field) is
needed. Los Angeles, though it has the equipment, is a doubtful win
ner because of the 19.'J2 games field there.
What is in it for Stanford ii San Francisco gets the games? Well, of
course prestige and publicity are the primary things. The only «lirect
profit the University would make are from two sources: Having improve
ments made on the stadium and parking lot free of charge, and renting
the dormitory space to either participants or fans.
Present plans have an Olympic Village to he constructed in San Bruno,
hut perhaps the track athletes would prefer staying here close to the
stadium. And, if they would not, certainly there are people from all
over the world who would prefer staying in Stern or Crothers than in
the city, .'lO miles away. The University would make Mime profit from
renting these otherwise-empty dormitories.

Santa Clara's baseball team, who faces Stanford in a CIBA game here
tomorrow, have presented quite a puzzle. How can a team have so much
potential, spectators ask, and be in the league cellar?
One experienced observer called the Bronco pitchers "the finest po
tential staff I've ever seen on a college tam." Apparently they have five
or six hurlers who are over 6-feet-2, and they should pose quite a problem
to opposing batsmen. The hitters, too, are quite a threat. Stars like Gus
Suhr, Dick Camilli, John McClellan, and Ron Moberg are among the
best in the league. Why the cellar position, then?
According to one CIBA coach who has seen the Broncos in action,
the answer is in the catching department. Santa Clara constantly uses
more than one receiver in a game trying to find a satisfactory catcher.
UCLA in one game, for instance, stole seven bases off the Broncos, and
consequently defeated them.
Coach Everett Dean's Indians, having heard about and read about
the Achille's heel of the Santa Clarans, are well aware of the weakness.
So you can expect to see lots of action on the base-paths come tomorrow.

Athletic Director A 1 Masters received a subpoena the other day to
testify in San Francisco. It seems that Oleg Suzdaleff injured his back
last summer in an accident, and is trying to collect damages.
The defense, however, is using Stanford's basketball records, which
show Suzdaleff played in every Indian game this season, as evidence
that Suzdaleff was not injured.
Apparently the officials do not recall that Joe DiMaggio played three
full seasons with the Yankees having a back which was so bad it needed
to be taped before every game. They also forget that Ben Hogan won a
golf championship in a condition so bad that he had to have the aid of
crutches when not on the course. There are untold other examples of
athletes playing under terrific physical handicaps and succeeding.

last summer in an accident, and is trying to collect damages.
The defense, however, is using Stanford's basketball records, which
show Suzdaleff played in every Indian game this season, as evidence
that Suzdaleff was not injured.
Apparently the officials do not recall that Joe DiMaggio played three
full seasons with the Yankees having a back which was so bad it needed
to be taped before every game. They also forget that Ben Hogan won a
golf championship in a condition so bad that he had to have the aid of
crutches when not on the course. There are untold other examples of
athletes playing under terrific physical handicaps and succeeding.
For several years now fans have been talking about having the Olympic
Games at Stanford . Usually these talks have been as much wishful thinking
as anything.
But the time has come to do some serious considering, for in the next few
weeks the site of the 195(> games will he decided. San Francisco is defi
nitely not out of the running yet. %
Over this next weekend, the Olympic Committee is meeting in Mexico
City to decide whether or not Australia will be able to handle the games.
Several well-informed officials doubt that this country will be able to pre
pare in time, so the site will be transferred.
It is then up to the United States to ban together and support a single
city for the games. At present sevbral cities, including Los Angeles,
Minneapolis, Detroit, Philadelphia, and San Francisco would like to have
the games. However, the committee is sure to give the games to Rome,
Buenos Aires, or some other foreign city if the United States officials
cannot agree among themselves which city they want. So the first step
lor San Francisco is to win approval among U.S. representatives.
One thing is certain: at this late date, the citv that takes the games
must have the FACILITIES to handle them. It is imposihle with only
three years notice to do what Helsinki did and construct almost an en
tire city.
Exactly where would the different events be held if San Francisco
did get the bid? Well, according to the present plans Stanford Stadium
would host the track events, which to most people is the meat of the
games. The basketball would be held in the Cow Palace, the equestrian
acts at Golden Gate Park. Rugby could be held in Kezar Stadium, and
of course the crew races on the bay. Other events such as archery, riflery
and weight lifting could be held just about anywhere, but San Francisco
would most likely like to keep as many of the events as possible within
the city limits. (Civic Auditorium, Golden Gate Park, Funston Field,
etc.).
However, one thing is certain: if San Francisco does get the bid, they
will have no choice as to where to hold the track events. Kezar would not
work, for it only lias 05,000 capacity, and because the gate receipts from
the track events support all of the other sports, the extra revenue would
be necessary. Besides, the Kezar running track is riot wide enough to
supply the necessary lanes. California's stadium, of course, has no run
ning track.
What changes would need to he made in Stanford's track to hold the
games? Two things: (1) the cuive at the north (closed) end of the
stadium would have to he widened slightly, (2) a new running surface
would need to he laid.
However, these changes are minor when it is remembered that Hel
sinki had to build an entire new stadium for the two-week event. Cities
competing for the games such as Philadelphia have one big handicap:
besides a regular stadium, a practice track (such as Angel! Field) is
needed. Los Angeles, though it has the equipment, is a doubtful win
ner because of the 19.'J2 games field there.
What is in it for Stanford ii San Francisco gets the games? Well, of
course prestige and publicity are the primary things. The only «lirect
profit the University would make are from two sources: Having improve
ments made on the stadium and parking lot free of charge, and renting
the dormitory space to either participants or fans.
Present plans have an Olympic Village to he constructed in San Bruno,
hut perhaps the track athletes would prefer staying here close to the
stadium. And, if they would not, certainly there are people from all
over the world who would prefer staying in Stern or Crothers than in
the city, .'lO miles away. The University would make Mime profit from
renting these otherwise-empty dormitories.

Santa Clara's baseball team, who faces Stanford in a CIBA game here
tomorrow, have presented quite a puzzle. How can a team have so much
potential, spectators ask, and be in the league cellar?
One experienced observer called the Bronco pitchers "the finest po
tential staff I've ever seen on a college tam." Apparently they have five
or six hurlers who are over 6-feet-2, and they should pose quite a problem
to opposing batsmen. The hitters, too, are quite a threat. Stars like Gus
Suhr, Dick Camilli, John McClellan, and Ron Moberg are among the
best in the league. Why the cellar position, then?
According to one CIBA coach who has seen the Broncos in action,
the answer is in the catching department. Santa Clara constantly uses
more than one receiver in a game trying to find a satisfactory catcher.
UCLA in one game, for instance, stole seven bases off the Broncos, and
consequently defeated them.
Coach Everett Dean's Indians, having heard about and read about
the Achille's heel of the Santa Clarans, are well aware of the weakness.
So you can expect to see lots of action on the base-paths come tomorrow.

According to one CIBA coach who has seen the Broncos in action,
the answer is in the catching department. Santa Clara constantly uses
more than one receiver in a game trying to find a satisfactory catcher.
UCLA in one game, for instance, stole seven bases off the Broncos, and
consequently defeated them.
Coach Everett Dean's Indians, having heard about and read about
the Achille's heel of the Santa Clarans, are well aware of the weakness.
So you can expect to see lots of action on the base-paths come tomorrow.

Athletic Director A 1 Masters received a subpoena the other day to
testify in San Francisco. It seems that Oleg Suzdaleff injured his back
last summer in an accident, and is trying to collect damages.
The defense, however, is using Stanford's basketball records, which
show Suzdaleff played in every Indian game this season, as evidence
that Suzdaleff was not injured.
Apparently the officials do not recall that Joe DiMaggio played three
full seasons with the Yankees having a back which was so bad it needed
to be taped before every game. They also forget that Ben Hogan won a
golf championship in a condition so bad that he had to have the aid of
crutches when not on the course. There are untold other examples of
athletes playing under terrific physical handicaps and succeeding.
For several years now fans have been talking about having the Olympic
Games at Stanford . Usually these talks have been as much wishful thinking
as anything.
But the time has come to do some serious considering, for in the next few
weeks the site of the 195(> games will he decided. San Francisco is defi
nitely not out of the running yet. %
Over this next weekend, the Olympic Committee is meeting in Mexico
City to decide whether or not Australia will be able to handle the games.
Several well-informed officials doubt that this country will be able to pre
pare in time, so the site will be transferred.
It is then up to the United States to ban together and support a single
city for the games. At present sevbral cities, including Los Angeles,
Minneapolis, Detroit, Philadelphia, and San Francisco would like to have
the games. However, the committee is sure to give the games to Rome,
Buenos Aires, or some other foreign city if the United States officials
cannot agree among themselves which city they want. So the first step
lor San Francisco is to win approval among U.S. representatives.
One thing is certain: at this late date, the citv that takes the games
must have the FACILITIES to handle them. It is imposihle with only
three years notice to do what Helsinki did and construct almost an en
tire city.
Exactly where would the different events be held if San Francisco
did get the bid? Well, according to the present plans Stanford Stadium
would host the track events, which to most people is the meat of the
games. The basketball would be held in the Cow Palace, the equestrian
acts at Golden Gate Park. Rugby could be held in Kezar Stadium, and
of course the crew races on the bay. Other events such as archery, riflery
and weight lifting could be held just about anywhere, but San Francisco
would most likely like to keep as many of the events as possible within
the city limits. (Civic Auditorium, Golden Gate Park, Funston Field,
etc.).
However, one thing is certain: if San Francisco does get the bid, they
will have no choice as to where to hold the track events. Kezar would not
work, for it only lias 05,000 capacity, and because the gate receipts from
the track events support all of the other sports, the extra revenue would
be necessary. Besides, the Kezar running track is riot wide enough to
supply the necessary lanes. California's stadium, of course, has no run
ning track.
What changes would need to he made in Stanford's track to hold the
games? Two things: (1) the cuive at the north (closed) end of the
stadium would have to he widened slightly, (2) a new running surface
would need to he laid.
However, these changes are minor when it is remembered that Hel
sinki had to build an entire new stadium for the two-week event. Cities
competing for the games such as Philadelphia have one big handicap:
besides a regular stadium, a practice track (such as Angel! Field) is
needed. Los Angeles, though it has the equipment, is a doubtful win
ner because of the 19.'J2 games field there.
What is in it for Stanford ii San Francisco gets the games? Well, of
course prestige and publicity are the primary things. The only «lirect
profit the University would make are from two sources: Having improve
ments made on the stadium and parking lot free of charge, and renting
the dormitory space to either participants or fans.
Present plans have an Olympic Village to he constructed in San Bruno,
hut perhaps the track athletes would prefer staying here close to the
stadium. And, if they would not, certainly there are people from all
over the world who would prefer staying in Stern or Crothers than in
the city, .'lO miles away. The University would make Mime profit from
renting these otherwise-empty dormitories.

Santa Clara's baseball team, who faces Stanford in a CIBA game here
tomorrow, have presented quite a puzzle. How can a team have so much
potential, spectators ask, and be in the league cellar?
One experienced observer called the Bronco pitchers "the finest po
tential staff I've ever seen on a college tam." Apparently they have five
or six hurlers who are over 6-feet-2, and they should pose quite a problem
to opposing batsmen. The hitters, too, are quite a threat. Stars like Gus
Suhr, Dick Camilli, John McClellan, and Ron Moberg are among the
best in the league. Why the cellar position, then?
