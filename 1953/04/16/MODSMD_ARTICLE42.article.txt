# ATHLETE OF THE WEEK
## jumping John Stewart Headed Toward Stardom 
### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
In last Saturday's Stanford-USC track meet, four men jumped to
a tie for first place in the high jump with a leap of six feet three
inches.
The same day, over at Angell Field, John Stewart won the same
event for the freshmen in their triangular meet with the City Col-

lege of San Francisco and West
Contra Costa JC. His winning
height was six feet five inches. This
height, in addition to being two
inches higher than the varsity mark.

also broke the old freshman record
of 6 ft. 4% in. set by Norm Jiles in
1950. For his achievement, Stewart
gets the nod as the Daily's "Ath
lete of the Week."
Stewart came to Stanford last
fall with quite an athletic repu
tation. While in high school,
across the road at Palo Alto, he

starred in football, basketball,
and track. The sports writers of
the area picked him as the North
ern California Athlete of the Year
for 1952.
John has more than lived up to
expectations since arriving on the
Farm, although he has dropped the
hardwood game from his list of en
deavors.
In the fall, he played end for the
football Papooses, scoring 18 points
for the season.
Now, of course, he is concentrat
ing on track. His record-breaking
mark of 6 ft. 5 in. tops his best high
school mark by an inch.
When asked if he had a prefer
ence for either track or football,
John came up with the answer
that should keep Messrs. Weiers
hauser and Taylor both content,
"I like them equally well." Con
sequently he is now confronted
with a problem. With football
spring practice coming up right in
the middle of track season, John
is wondering how to keep in top
shape for the cinder sport, and at
the same time get in conteqten
tion for one of those 11 starting
berths.
In answer to our standard ques
tion, "What gave you your biggest
thrill so far in athletics?" Stewart
remembered the two touchdowns he
scored against UCLA to help drub
the Baby* Bruins 42-7.

tion, "What gave you your biggest

remembered the two touchdowns he
scored against UCLA to help drub
