# 1,341 PINTS STILL NEEDED
## Final Try for Giant Blood Goal Todayâ€”'Can WE Make It?' 
### DOROTHY DODGE Editorial Assistant, The Daily 
There are 1,341 pints left to go to make the 5,000-pint goal in
Stanford's record-shattering Blood Drive.
"Can we do it?" Chairman Ken Schechter asked the student
body last night as the drive ended its fourth day with a total of
3,659 pints donated. One last big push is being made to bring in
donors for today. Schechter hopes to beat the 1,167-pint one-day
record set by Soledad Prison.
All Will Be Cared For
"We need every single unsigned donor today," Schechter em
phasized, promising that all donors would be taken care of.
Nine hundred seventy people donated blood yesterday. Ono
thousand forty-nine came in and only sixty-nine were rejected.
Three hundred eighteen missed their appointments.
The big Red Cross collection center in the Pavilion will remain
open today from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. but the committee promises
that no donors will be turned away. Donors may drop in at the
Pavilion at any time, or phone DA 3-8096 for appointments.
The Red Cross flew in additional personnel and added extra
equipment Wednesday night to speed up the efficiency process;
and an hour and a half was the longest wait reported yesterday.
The drive has already broken most available collegiate records.
The 2,810 pints collected in one University of Texas drive in 1951
has held the top mark for sheer size up to now. Percentagewise,
Cal Poly still leads with 67 per cent of the student body donating
1,317 pints in three days last month.

of us."

in search of donors. An extra drive has been arranged to try to
raise the faculty percentage today.
