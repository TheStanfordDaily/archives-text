The Campus Blood Drive has been snowball
ing through the week, until now it has reached
the point where a tremendous one-day effort
can carry it over the top.
Ken Schechter has been wrangling the Bed
Cross into staying open tonight until the last
donor has been handled, so how about a "big
ten" as they say in crew.
One hindrance has been an overabundance
of student "no-shows," those persons lailing to
keep their appointments.
There were 241 such cases on Monday. 310
Tuesday, and over 200 each Wednesday and
yesterday.
With an influx of these students making up
their appointments today, Stanford can hard
ly tail to make its goal of 5,000 pints and at the
same time set a new national one day record
for number of pints given.
The University faculty and staff and the off

campus and graduate groups of students are
still the main segments of the campus commu
nity that are falling down.
We urge the students to do a bit of enthus
iastic badgering today to get their instructors
and professors to take time off from their Cel
lar cups of coffee or research cubbyholes to
give a pint of blood.
The one notable exception to the weak off
campus and graduate turnout has been the Biz
School from which reports yesterday stated that
over 80 per cent of the Biz students had donated.
Law, ed, physics, engineering grads, or
whatever you are, it's not a matter of losing
your well-preened dignity by stooping to en
gage in a student drive, it's simply a case of
lifting a helping hand to save a man's life.
From our corner, it's worth a rousing display
of selflessness on this last day of the Blood
Drive.
