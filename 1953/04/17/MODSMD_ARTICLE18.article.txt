The Sumner issue has pinpointed attention on
one basic problem the one of teaching versus re
search.
This problem is not one that the administration
has a priority on. The students are as much involved
because the caliber of teaching we students receive
depends upon emphasis that the administration put*;
on teaching.
The administration, however, is in a prickly situa
tion. Stanford, like most privately , .

endowed universities, has a tight
financial problem.
Securing grants and gifts de
pends, in large, upon maintain
ing u high national standing. A
university is given a high na
tional ranking 011 the basis of
its research accomplishments
und its publications.
A national ranking rarely is
correlated with teaching. A

great teacher is seldom heard of beyond the next
county.
Thus, Stanford, whether it admits it or not, has
put emphasis on research. It has done this to main
tain it.s high national reputation, which, in turn,
brings in cold cash.
We admit that research is indispensable to a uni
versity and that teaching anil research are not in
compatible. But as Dr. Sterling has remarked, there

are unfortunately too few men like Dr. Thomas
Bailey, who can combine great research with great
teaching. Usually, it's one or the other. Unhappily,
good teaching has been woefully neglected in ap
pointments and promotions.
If you don't believe this, think back over your years
at Stanford and determine what per cent of your
teachers have really been inspiring. What per cent
of your teachers here have made you look forward
to going to class and to pursue the course of study
beyond the requirements?
Many brilliant scholars have earned Stanford the
reputation tha( the administration seeks. But the
tragic thing is that few undergraduates ever benefit
from the reputation. As Bull Sessioner Vic Pahnieri
once said:
"We pay $220 a quarter for the Stanford reputation,
not for the Stanford education."
In short, the average undergraduate stands in the
glimmering light that these greut intellects shed, but
seldom profit from their accomplishments.
Some day, the administration may shift its em
phasis.
Some day, the students may be able to say that
the majority of their professors are inspiring teachers.
Some day, men like Dr. Sumner won't be released
because their research accomplishments are modest.
But until that day comes, the Stanford student will
continue to pay $220 a quarter for the Stanford
reputation and not for the Stanford education.

Thus, Stanford, whether it admits it or not, has
put emphasis on research. It has done this to main
tain it.s high national reputation, which, in turn,
brings in cold cash.
We admit that research is indispensable to a uni
versity and that teaching anil research are not in
compatible. But as Dr. Sterling has remarked, there

are unfortunately too few men like Dr. Thomas
Bailey, who can combine great research with great
teaching. Usually, it's one or the other. Unhappily,
good teaching has been woefully neglected in ap
pointments and promotions.
If you don't believe this, think back over your years
at Stanford and determine what per cent of your
teachers have really been inspiring. What per cent
of your teachers here have made you look forward
to going to class and to pursue the course of study
beyond the requirements?
Many brilliant scholars have earned Stanford the
reputation tha( the administration seeks. But the
tragic thing is that few undergraduates ever benefit
from the reputation. As Bull Sessioner Vic Pahnieri
once said:
"We pay $220 a quarter for the Stanford reputation,
not for the Stanford education."
In short, the average undergraduate stands in the
glimmering light that these greut intellects shed, but
seldom profit from their accomplishments.
Some day, the administration may shift its em
phasis.
Some day, the students may be able to say that
the majority of their professors are inspiring teachers.
Some day, men like Dr. Sumner won't be released
because their research accomplishments are modest.
But until that day comes, the Stanford student will
continue to pay $220 a quarter for the Stanford
reputation and not for the Stanford education.

The Sumner issue has pinpointed attention on
one basic problem the one of teaching versus re
search.
This problem is not one that the administration
has a priority on. The students are as much involved
because the caliber of teaching we students receive
depends upon emphasis that the administration put*;
on teaching.
The administration, however, is in a prickly situa
tion. Stanford, like most privately , .

endowed universities, has a tight
financial problem.
Securing grants and gifts de
pends, in large, upon maintain
ing u high national standing. A
university is given a high na
tional ranking 011 the basis of
its research accomplishments
und its publications.
A national ranking rarely is
correlated with teaching. A

great teacher is seldom heard of beyond the next
county.
