## 'Instruction of Students' 
### 
To the Editor:
They say the Sumner case is closed. I hope not,
for Dr. Sumner symbolizes the conflict within an in
stitution of higher learning as to emphasis on research
as opposed to instruction of students.
In the Foilmting Grant, Senator and Mrs. Stanford
joined in declaring that the ob'ect of Stanford Uni
versity was to "qualify its students for personal
success, and direct usefulness in.life." In outlining
the duties of the trustees, the emphasis was again
on the student.
Mr. and Mrs. Stanford were interested in making
successful and useful citizens. In this development,
they stressed thy securing of the best teachers. They
realized the need for research "to advance learning,"
but the chief object remained "the instruction of stu
dents with a view to producing leaders and educators
in every field of science and industry." This object

should be the chief goal of Stanford University today.
Dr. Sumner is acknowledged by all as an excel
lent teacher, one who has both the love and respect of
his students. He has awakened many from an aca
demic lethargy. His one deficiency seems to be his
research output. The research ability of an institu
tion's professors—not output necessarily but qual
ity of work—somewhat corresponds to the reputa
tion of a university in professional circles.
But when a university overemphasizes the. func
tion of research, doesn't it risk losing sight of its
original end—that is, the preparation of successful
and useful citizens?
Today at Stanford, an excellent teacher stands as
a martyr to what appears to be a forgotten end of
the University an end which is being sacrificed in
the quest for reputation at the expense of student
education!
