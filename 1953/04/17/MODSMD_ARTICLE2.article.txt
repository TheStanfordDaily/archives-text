# Ike Challenges Russians To Prove Peace Overtures

### 
WASHINGTON, April 16 (UP)
— President Eisenhower chal
lenged Russia's new leaders to
day to prove they want peace by
ending the Korean war and join
ing the Allies in a bold new at
tempt to wipe out world "pov
erty and need."
He served notice, however, that
the United States will insist on a
"unified" Korea as a condition to
any armistice, to be followed by
"free" Korean cleetions.
Mr. Eisenhower also called on the
Soviets to lift the Iron Curtain from
Communist satellite states, to end
the fighting in Indo-China, and to
enter into a five-point disarmament
pact that would outlaw atomic
weapons.
His disarmament plan railed
for a "practical" system of inspec
tion under the United Nations.
Russia heretofore has refused to
agree to such a system, There also
has been no siffn the Reds would
accept free elections in a unified
Korea. •
In a major foreign policy address
before the American Society of
Newspaper Editors, the President
solemnly warned that the present
atomic arms race threatens all sys
tems of government — capitalist or
Communist — and has "humanity
hanging from a cross of iron."
"Every gun that is made," he de
clared, "every warship launched,
every rocket fired signifies—in the
final sense—a theft from those who
hunger and are not fed, those who
arc cold and are not clothed."
Mr. Eisenhower said the free
world does "not yet know"
whether the Russians really want
peace. Hut he added that Stalin's
death gave the new Soviet lead
ers "a precious chancc to turn the
black tide of events" away from
the destruction of atomic war.
If they seize this opportunity, he
said, his administration stands ready
to join hands with them in "a new
kind of war . . . not upon any
human enemy, but upon the brute
forces of poverty and need." This
global program would be financed
out of the savings achieved by dis
armament.
The Chief Executive drew per
haps his greatest applause when he
asserted that an "honorable armi
stice" in Korea must provide for
"free elections in a united Korea."
In laying down a broad U.S. for
eign policy, Mr. Eisenhower also:
I. Advised the Kremlin it can
demonstrate good faith in Europe
by freeing satellite nations to
choose their own form of govern
ment, releasing "thousands" of
prisoners from World War II, and
agreeing to an Austrian peace
treaty.
2. Declared that a free Germany
and the "full independence" of the
East European nations "could mean
the end of the present unnatural
division of Europe."
