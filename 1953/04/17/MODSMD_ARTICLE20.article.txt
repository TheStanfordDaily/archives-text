# Excom Hears Problems Of Political Committee
## 
### HADLEY ROFF Associate Editor, The Daily 
Bill Fundenberg, chairman of the
student faculty political committee,
pointed out in his report to the Ex
ecutive Committee Wednesday night
that his group is seriously handi
capped by several prohibitions im
posed by the Board of Trustees.
Chief among the prohibitions is
tlu ban against partisan political
groups organizing on campus. It was
suggested by several Excom mem
bers, and particularly Village Rep
resentee Fran Kirk, that a politi
cal committee can hardly be ex
pected to act when partisan groups
are banned.
Fundenberg also said his group
encountered difficulty during the
post election year in bringing key
political figures to campus. Though
many of the leading national poli
ticians said they would like to come
to the campus, usder the regulation',
set down by the Board such was im
possible.
The Board ruling specifies that
during an election year partisan
viewpoints can only bo presented
if both sides are represented on the
same platform. Such' arrangements
are hard to make in as much as the
schedules of the different politicians
seldom coincide.
After hearing Fundenberg's re
marks and those of the committee's
former chairman. Arnold Gold, Ex
com adopted a list of recommenda
tions, including a suggestion that
the chairman of the political com
mittee contact the administration and
set forth the problems which have
reportedly beset the group

112 Also it was suggested that the
! committee check the possibility of
, organizing a political union or club
similar to those active an the Yale
and Oxford campuses.
Such a club, according to Funden
berg, could serve as a discussion
center.
Excom, in moving to extend the
i life of the one-year-old committee,
made this one provision, that if the
| committee shows no further progress
! within a year that it be disbanded.
Excom, at its Wednesday meet
ing, also set up a committee of five
students, three from Excom and two
from Cardinals, to investigate the
possibility of establishing a House
of Representatives on campus. This
body, according to Business Manager
j Steve Horn, who originated the pro
posal, will sit as a lower house to
Excom.
