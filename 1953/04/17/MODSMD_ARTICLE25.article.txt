In 1934, Stanford University
faced a financial problem
brought about by the depres
sion, and 14 alumni met to dis
cuss the University's needs and
ways of meeting them.
Today, Stanford University faces
"the tightest financial situation in
its history," and the Stanford Asso
ciates, a volunteer organization
which grew out of the original 14
alumni, raises an average of $347,-
000 in its annual appeal for gifts to
the University.
Tomorrow, the Stanford Asso
ciates and other alumni groups,
pledged (o working for the wel
fare of Stanford, will continue
their efforts to raise what now
amounts to over $3,000,001) a year
in gilts and bequests to the Uni
versity.
The work of the Stanford Asso
ciates is representative of all the
work being done on behalf of the
University to help ease the financial
stress which it faces during the next
few years. The problems it faces in
making "alumni and friends aware
of the need for gifts" are universal
to all private universities in the
United States.
The work of the Associates is the
responsibility of 320 men, Stanford
alumni who pay yearly dues for
membership which entitles them to
work in fund - raising projects.
Those projects are the result of an
awareness by members of the pat
tern of deficit financing in which
the University finds itself.
To extend that awareness to the
large body of "alumni and friends
of the University," the members of
the Stanford Associates and or
ganizations like it make use of
publications and personal contact.

The General Secretary's office of
the University provides the facili
ties for the publicity; the mem
bers of the Associates provide the
"facilities" for the personal con
tact.
Through such means, the Univer
sity received gifts totaling $3,300,-
000 during the school year 1951 to
1952. Of these gifts, $1,890,000 was
designated for "current use," and
$1,409,000 was forwarded to the
University's endowment. Most of
the gifts are in the form of bequests,
the largest of which during that
year came to $250,000.
Of the money set aside for "cur
rent use," only $305,000 was "un
restricted." Most of the gifts are
designated for specific schools at
Stanford, and a major portion of all
the gilts are designated for specific
activities. Such a high proportion
of restricted gifts creates a problem
of budgeting for University officials.
Each year, for example, the Uni
versity receives amounts of money
for a "Fund to Rebuild the Spire on
Memorial Church." The Univer
sity does not intend to rebuild the
spire on Memorial Church, and is
thus faced with the problem of
holding money which could easily
be used for current operating ex
penses.
In the overall total of gifts to
the University, only 4i 5 per cent
is unrestricted. The rest is speci
fied for a particular school or ac
tivity.
But whatever the amount of re
stricted gifts, the University needi;
every dollar of the gifts that arc
forwarded. In its efforts to raise
such dollars, the Stanford Associ
ates attempts to avoid "flamboyant
fund-raising campaigns." In its an
nual appeal to alumni and friends
for the Stanford Family Fund, the
members of the Associates stress
the publication of the factual needs
of the University, in a "quiet and
dignified manner."
Ideally, its officers look forward
to the day when every Stanford
graduate is a "salesman'" for the
University, a day when every Stan
ford graduate participates in finan
cial assistance to Stanford.

In 1934, Stanford University
faced a financial problem
brought about by the depres
sion, and 14 alumni met to dis
cuss the University's needs and
ways of meeting them.
Today, Stanford University faces
"the tightest financial situation in
its history," and the Stanford Asso
ciates, a volunteer organization
which grew out of the original 14
alumni, raises an average of $347,-
000 in its annual appeal for gifts to
the University.
Tomorrow, the Stanford Asso
ciates and other alumni groups,
pledged (o working for the wel
fare of Stanford, will continue
their efforts to raise what now
amounts to over $3,000,001) a year
in gilts and bequests to the Uni
versity.
The work of the Stanford Asso
ciates is representative of all the
work being done on behalf of the
University to help ease the financial
stress which it faces during the next
few years. The problems it faces in
making "alumni and friends aware
of the need for gifts" are universal
to all private universities in the
United States.
The work of the Associates is the
responsibility of 320 men, Stanford
alumni who pay yearly dues for
membership which entitles them to
work in fund - raising projects.
Those projects are the result of an
awareness by members of the pat
tern of deficit financing in which
the University finds itself.
To extend that awareness to the
large body of "alumni and friends
of the University," the members of
the Stanford Associates and or
ganizations like it make use of
publications and personal contact.

The General Secretary's office of
the University provides the facili
ties for the publicity; the mem
bers of the Associates provide the
"facilities" for the personal con
tact.
Through such means, the Univer
sity received gifts totaling $3,300,-
000 during the school year 1951 to
1952. Of these gifts, $1,890,000 was
designated for "current use," and
$1,409,000 was forwarded to the
University's endowment. Most of
the gifts are in the form of bequests,
the largest of which during that
year came to $250,000.
Of the money set aside for "cur
rent use," only $305,000 was "un
restricted." Most of the gifts are
designated for specific schools at
Stanford, and a major portion of all
the gilts are designated for specific
activities. Such a high proportion
of restricted gifts creates a problem
of budgeting for University officials.
Each year, for example, the Uni
versity receives amounts of money
for a "Fund to Rebuild the Spire on
Memorial Church." The Univer
sity does not intend to rebuild the
spire on Memorial Church, and is
thus faced with the problem of
holding money which could easily
be used for current operating ex
penses.
In the overall total of gifts to
the University, only 4i 5 per cent
is unrestricted. The rest is speci
fied for a particular school or ac
tivity.
