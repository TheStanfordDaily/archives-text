# Cards Host Broncs Today; Hope to Widen CIBA Lead
## 
### 
Stanford's baseballers, rested from a week's layoff in CIBA play,
return to action this afternoon as they host Santa Clara on the
Sunken Diamond at 3:15.
Tomorrow the Indians travel to Washington Park in Santa Clara I
to face the Broncos in a 2 o'clock contest. Phil Page is slated to

'hurl today, with Bob Murphy see
ing action tomorrow.
While Stanford leads the league
by 1H> games, Santa Clara, doped
to be a pennant contender this sea
son, rests in the CIBA cellar. Last
week was beneficial to the Indians
as California dropped the Broncos
twice and USC did the same to the
Bruins.
Coach Bill Prentice of the visi
tors has a great wealth of material.
He has a big, deep hurling stall'
(Seybold, Zasso, Sherwood, Camilli,
Cole, and Simoni) and what should
be a heavy-hitting offense (Suhr,
Camilli, Moberg, Welp, McClellan,
Nardinelli). The plate power seems
to have been stifled so far this year,
though, as Santa Clara has a team
average of .198.
Don Seybold, erratic right
hander, will take the mound to
day, and either Dick Simoni or
fireballer Pete Zasso will hurl to
morrow.
On the other hand, the Stanford
story has been one of success. Al
though they have lost their last two
games to professional or service
U*ims, Everett Dean's men have
looked good doing so. Catcher Jack
Shepard continues his terrific bat
ting pace with a .457 mark.
Despite the fact that the Broncos
are in the cellar, the weekend is an
important one for the Indians. Foi
should they sweep the series while
the Cal - UCLA games are eithei
.split or taken by UCLA, it would
take little short of tragedy to take
the pennant away from Stanford.
One of the big worries of Prentice
this season has been the catching
department. Though he has an oth
erwise well-balanced squad, a gooe
receiver has thus far been lacking
So no little action can be looked foi
by the Indians on the basepaths to
day. â€”D. W.
