### DON STEPHENS 
It may be irony but Cal is the
only stumbling block left between
Stanford and another undefeated
season The two vie toelay at 3:30
p.m. in the Encina pool.
Cal too has gone through the sea
son unbeaten, but the Bear's op
ponents can hardly fequal the cali
ber of the Indians' foes.
Stanforel in this 36 year olel series,
has run up a record of 37 victories
to live defeats. The schools have met
twice each season since 1947.
According to Haynie, Stanford
should win by about 36 points,
against an undermanned squad that
boasts only three men of top-flight
caliber.
Cal is counting heavily on Alan
Lauderbaek to come back to his PCC
meter freestyle.

In the 200 yard backstroke, Jim
Ross, who placed fifth in the na
tionals last yew, is expected to re*-
cover sufficiently to give John Weis
er a run for his money.
However, the Bear's big hope is
Jerry Hayes who placed second in
the 200 yard breaststroke champion
ships. Hayes will enter the 200 yard
breast and will be ready to go again
in the 150 yard individual medley
against Jim Gaughran.
Sfcinford will be ready to go with
its 300 yard medley relay team of
Heim, Ashley Jones and Boh Koll.
Two thirds of this trio, Heim and
Jones helped cop a second place in
the 300 medley in the NCAA meet
last month.
Dan Osborne and Jim Lee will
be out for a first and second in the

220 freestyle, while Lee Gunnerson
and Burt Holiday will try to dupli
cate in the 50 freestyle. Gunerson
and Lee are favored in the 100 free
style.
Only one man from Stanford will
be entered in the 200 yard backstroke
â€”Weiser, who is favored.
The final event of the clay, the
400 yard relay, should be another
win with Gaughran, Bob Thomp
son, Heim and Bob Morris out to
complete a white-wash job on the
Californians.
The Papoose swim team will meet
the Cubs in their annual meet which
runs concurrently with the varsity.
Admission for the meet will be
80 cents for adults, 60 cents for high
schol and junior college students,
50 cents for Stanford students, and
30 cents for all children.
