# Varsity Tracksters Fly South To Meet Upset-Minded Bruins
## 
### 
A Stanford track team determined not To lose another dual meet
this year takes to the wing this afternoon to meet an upset-minded
Bruin in his Coliseum lair Saturday.
The Bruins, a nebulous quantity so far this year, could just pull
the meet out of the fire with a few come-through performances.

Two years ago a highly favored
Indian team flew south on a Satur
day morn, spent an hour and a hali
flying around the Rockies looking
for a lost plane, and was deposited,
air-sick, into the hands of the wait
ing Bruin. UCLA pulled the upset
strings, 69-61.
This year the Bruins, though
lacking depth in the field, may
just have enough good perform
ers to walk off with all the.mar-
It les.
From the lips of Track Coach
Jack Weiershauser, Bob Mathias
"will be a doubtful starter in either
hurdle, and definitely won't go in
' the highs." This will give UCLA's
Dave Rosellini a shoo-in in the lows
and make it a real bind for first
between Rosellini and Stanford's
fast-coming Jerry Wood in the
highs. Of note, Rosellini fell in both
hurdles last week.
Rod Richard, sprinter deluxe,
should romp home a double winner
as he did last year. Maury Parsons
and Keith Biownsberger won't be
more than a whisker behind.
Stanford's number one javelin
man, Leo Low*, became a proud
poppa this week to an 8 Va-pound
hoy, and won't be making the
trip. In his stead, Dick Holmes
will fight it out with UCLA's Jan
Tayiz for the third spot behind
Stanford's Hob Kimball and
Chucg Harlow.

big star, 14-foot pole vaulter Len
Eilers.

hurdle, and definitely won't go in
' the highs." This will give UCLA's
Dave Rosellini a shoo-in in the lows
and make it a real bind for first
between Rosellini and Stanford's
fast-coming Jerry Wood in the
highs. Of note, Rosellini fell in both
hurdles last week.
Rod Richard, sprinter deluxe,
should romp home a double winner
as he did last year. Maury Parsons
and Keith Biownsberger won't be
more than a whisker behind.
Stanford's number one javelin
man, Leo Low*, became a proud
poppa this week to an 8 Va-pound
hoy, and won't be making the
trip. In his stead, Dick Holmes
will fight it out with UCLA's Jan
Tayiz for the third spot behind
Stanford's Hob Kimball and
Chucg Harlow.
