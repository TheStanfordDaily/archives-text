TOKYO, Friday, April 17 (UP) —The United Nations agreed to
day to resume Korean truce talks under a formula that would in

stalling at the conference table.
The U.N. note, delivered at Panmunjom this morning, called for

liaison group meetings Saturday to

24 truckloads of sick and wound
ed Allied prisoners waited six

convoys were approaching the
city.
Allied pilots sighted 34 trucks
about 65 miles north of Kaesong at
10:30 a.m. (5:30 p.m. PST Thursday)
and for the first time since the con
voy movements began, saw no oth
er enemy traffic.
"Not a thing is moving except the
convoy trucks," a pilot reported.
The new U.N. note accepted as
a working basis the compromise
plan announced March 31 by Chi
nese Communist Premier Cbou
Kn-lai. lie proposed to break the
final Korean truce deadlock over
prisoner repatriation by turning
over to a neutral nation those
captives who refuse to go home
now.
The U.N. proposed that a neutral
nation "such as Switzerland" take
control of prisoners who refuse re
patriation.

neutral nation should make "peace
able disposition" of those prisoners
remaining in its custody after each
side has been given days to try
to persuade its men to come home.
