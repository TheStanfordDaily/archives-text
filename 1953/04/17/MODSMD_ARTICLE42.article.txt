# PUBLIC RELATIONS BOARD
## Director Clark Sees and Does 
### BOB REZAK 
When auburn - haired Nancy
Jane Clark took over her job as
ASSU Public Relations Board di
rector last spring it was, she ad
mitted yesterday, "like plunging
into Lake Lagunita and finding
no water there."
The Public Relations Board, then
a little more than a year old, had
come under fire for not living up
to its original function, that of co
ordinating and regulating ASSU
publicity and public relations.
On top of that it had become the
target for popular criticism inter
mingled with personality conflicts.
To the keen observer and the cas
ual onlooker alike it seemed as |
though the board would soon defeat j
its own purpose and finally disin
tegrate.
Miss Clark, sensing the need for
such an organization on the cam
pus, viewed the Public Relations
Hoard as a "vital and necessary
service" for the ASSU, and ac
cepted the challenge.
"I decided I was going to put on
my Joan of Arc armor and crusade
ahead," she remarked.
How well the senior from San
Gabriel, Calif., has led her "crusade"
and also her 15-member team of

zealots, was indicated in part re
cently in the board's semi - annual
report.
Under Miss Clark's vibrant leader
ship, the report shows, Public Re
lations Board has broadened the
scope of its work to include some
clear-cut objectives including finding
areas and suggestions for improv
ing ASSU public relations and the
progress of the student body in gen
eral.
The biggest job, according to
Miss Clark, has been to pull the
board out of the doldrums and
"set the operation in motion"
whereby it could operate smoothly
and efficiently.
Public Relations Board believes in
the philosophy that in a good public
relations program the details and
calculated effect must be planned
far in advance. Hence, the process
was necessarily slow.
Three departments — public rela
tions, the campaigns, general office
—were created within the Board,
with the latter ranking as the top de
cision-making group.
Although the ASSU by-laws do
not specify limitation of member
ship on the board, Miss Clark feels
a staff of 15 is adequate to provide
maximum efficiency of operation
in as specialized a field as public
relations.
Since Gordon Addison, former
Daily edkor, first organized the
board in 1951, what progress has
been made in ASSU public relations?
Miss Clark cited the research pro
gram, a year-long effort to find out
the needs of the ASSU and its or
ganizations, as the board's chief ac
complishment during the past year.
A dozen minds and energies were
turned loose upon the job of in
vestigating and learning how the
board may more effectively improve
ASSU relations in the University
community with merchants, high
schools, and citizens. Similarly the
need for improving student-faculty
and inter-college relations was real
ized.

The study showed relations be
tween Palo Alto High School fresh
men and Stanford freshmen could be
improved. And it showed that so
liciting Palo Alto merchants by some
campus organizations often involved
a harmful, wrong approach that
needed correction.
These problems are currently
under more intensive study by the
board.
A prospective orientation pro
grain for new faculty members,
currently under study also, has
won the approval of some Uni
versity officials.
Under this program. Miss Clark
said, a welcoming letter would be
sent to new faculty members inform
ing them, for example, of Stanford
activities, the honor code, and the
informal situation that exists here.
"We believe this is puDlic rela
tions of the first order," the director
said.
Noting that practically nothing has
been done to improve inter-college
relations, Miss Clark sees the dire
need for stimulating participation in
joint activities with other colleges
like USC and UCLA.
The upcoming Cal-Stanford Frosh
Picnic might very well be a test of
how inter-college relations can be
improved, Miss Clark indicated.
Much of the board's research
project has involved the collection
of information that can be of prac
tical use to campus organizations.
A list of interviewing procedures
for organizations who gain mem
bers through interviews, for ex

ample, has been compiled.
Now that such a storehouse of in
formation has been compiled, Miss
Clark believes the Public Relations
Board stands ready to further help
organizations by informing them of
such matters as sources of publicity
and media of communication on and
off the campus.
Her fondest hope is to carry public
relations research conductcd during
the past year into actual programs.
That means first seeing that some
kind of workable standards for ef
fective public relations are devised
and that all campus organizations
get a fair chance to use communica
tion facilities available.

community with merchants, high
schools, and citizens. Similarly the
need for improving student-faculty
and inter-college relations was real
ized.

The study showed relations be
tween Palo Alto High School fresh
men and Stanford freshmen could be
improved. And it showed that so
liciting Palo Alto merchants by some
campus organizations often involved
a harmful, wrong approach that
needed correction.
These problems are currently
under more intensive study by the
board.
A prospective orientation pro
grain for new faculty members,
currently under study also, has
won the approval of some Uni
versity officials.
Under this program. Miss Clark
said, a welcoming letter would be
sent to new faculty members inform
ing them, for example, of Stanford
activities, the honor code, and the
informal situation that exists here.
"We believe this is puDlic rela
tions of the first order," the director
said.
Noting that practically nothing has
been done to improve inter-college
relations, Miss Clark sees the dire
need for stimulating participation in
joint activities with other colleges
like USC and UCLA.
The upcoming Cal-Stanford Frosh
Picnic might very well be a test of
how inter-college relations can be
improved, Miss Clark indicated.
Much of the board's research
project has involved the collection
of information that can be of prac
tical use to campus organizations.
A list of interviewing procedures
for organizations who gain mem
bers through interviews, for ex

ample, has been compiled.
Now that such a storehouse of in
formation has been compiled, Miss
Clark believes the Public Relations
Board stands ready to further help
organizations by informing them of
such matters as sources of publicity
and media of communication on and
off the campus.
Her fondest hope is to carry public
relations research conductcd during
the past year into actual programs.
That means first seeing that some
kind of workable standards for ef
fective public relations are devised
and that all campus organizations
get a fair chance to use communica
tion facilities available.


NANCY CLARK
—Public Relations Board
When auburn - haired Nancy
Jane Clark took over her job as
ASSU Public Relations Board di
rector last spring it was, she ad
mitted yesterday, "like plunging
into Lake Lagunita and finding
no water there."
The Public Relations Board, then
a little more than a year old, had
come under fire for not living up
to its original function, that of co
ordinating and regulating ASSU
publicity and public relations.
On top of that it had become the
target for popular criticism inter
mingled with personality conflicts.
To the keen observer and the cas
ual onlooker alike it seemed as |
though the board would soon defeat j
its own purpose and finally disin
tegrate.
Miss Clark, sensing the need for
such an organization on the cam
pus, viewed the Public Relations
Hoard as a "vital and necessary
service" for the ASSU, and ac
cepted the challenge.
"I decided I was going to put on
my Joan of Arc armor and crusade
ahead," she remarked.
How well the senior from San
Gabriel, Calif., has led her "crusade"
and also her 15-member team of

zealots, was indicated in part re
cently in the board's semi - annual
report.
Under Miss Clark's vibrant leader
ship, the report shows, Public Re
lations Board has broadened the
scope of its work to include some
clear-cut objectives including finding
areas and suggestions for improv
ing ASSU public relations and the
progress of the student body in gen
eral.
The biggest job, according to
Miss Clark, has been to pull the
board out of the doldrums and
"set the operation in motion"
whereby it could operate smoothly
and efficiently.
Public Relations Board believes in
the philosophy that in a good public
relations program the details and
calculated effect must be planned
far in advance. Hence, the process
was necessarily slow.
Three departments — public rela
tions, the campaigns, general office
—were created within the Board,
with the latter ranking as the top de
cision-making group.
Although the ASSU by-laws do
not specify limitation of member
ship on the board, Miss Clark feels
a staff of 15 is adequate to provide
maximum efficiency of operation
in as specialized a field as public
relations.
Since Gordon Addison, former
Daily edkor, first organized the
board in 1951, what progress has
been made in ASSU public relations?
Miss Clark cited the research pro
gram, a year-long effort to find out
the needs of the ASSU and its or
ganizations, as the board's chief ac
complishment during the past year.
A dozen minds and energies were
turned loose upon the job of in
vestigating and learning how the
board may more effectively improve
ASSU relations in the University
community with merchants, high
schools, and citizens. Similarly the
need for improving student-faculty

Hoard as a "vital and necessary
service" for the ASSU, and ac
cepted the challenge.
"I decided I was going to put on
my Joan of Arc armor and crusade
ahead," she remarked.
How well the senior from San
Gabriel, Calif., has led her "crusade"
and also her 15-member team of

zealots, was indicated in part re
cently in the board's semi - annual
report.
Under Miss Clark's vibrant leader
ship, the report shows, Public Re
lations Board has broadened the
scope of its work to include some
clear-cut objectives including finding
areas and suggestions for improv
ing ASSU public relations and the
progress of the student body in gen
eral.
The biggest job, according to
Miss Clark, has been to pull the
board out of the doldrums and
"set the operation in motion"
whereby it could operate smoothly
and efficiently.
Public Relations Board believes in
the philosophy that in a good public
relations program the details and
calculated effect must be planned
far in advance. Hence, the process
was necessarily slow.
Three departments — public rela
tions, the campaigns, general office
—were created within the Board,
with the latter ranking as the top de
cision-making group.
Although the ASSU by-laws do
not specify limitation of member
ship on the board, Miss Clark feels
a staff of 15 is adequate to provide
maximum efficiency of operation
in as specialized a field as public
relations.
Since Gordon Addison, former
Daily edkor, first organized the
board in 1951, what progress has
been made in ASSU public relations?
Miss Clark cited the research pro
gram, a year-long effort to find out
the needs of the ASSU and its or
ganizations, as the board's chief ac
complishment during the past year.
A dozen minds and energies were
turned loose upon the job of in
vestigating and learning how the
board may more effectively improve
ASSU relations in the University
community with merchants, high
schools, and citizens. Similarly the
need for improving student-faculty
and inter-college relations was real
ized.

The study showed relations be
tween Palo Alto High School fresh
men and Stanford freshmen could be
improved. And it showed that so
liciting Palo Alto merchants by some
campus organizations often involved
a harmful, wrong approach that
needed correction.
These problems are currently
under more intensive study by the
board.
A prospective orientation pro
grain for new faculty members,
currently under study also, has
won the approval of some Uni
versity officials.
Under this program. Miss Clark
said, a welcoming letter would be
sent to new faculty members inform
ing them, for example, of Stanford
activities, the honor code, and the
informal situation that exists here.
"We believe this is puDlic rela
tions of the first order," the director
said.
Noting that practically nothing has
been done to improve inter-college
relations, Miss Clark sees the dire
need for stimulating participation in
joint activities with other colleges
like USC and UCLA.
The upcoming Cal-Stanford Frosh
Picnic might very well be a test of
how inter-college relations can be
improved, Miss Clark indicated.
Much of the board's research
project has involved the collection
of information that can be of prac
tical use to campus organizations.
A list of interviewing procedures
for organizations who gain mem
bers through interviews, for ex

ample, has been compiled.
Now that such a storehouse of in
formation has been compiled, Miss
Clark believes the Public Relations
Board stands ready to further help
organizations by informing them of
such matters as sources of publicity
and media of communication on and
off the campus.
Her fondest hope is to carry public
relations research conductcd during
the past year into actual programs.
That means first seeing that some
kind of workable standards for ef
fective public relations are devised
and that all campus organizations
get a fair chance to use communica
tion facilities available.


NANCY CLARK
—Public Relations Board
When auburn - haired Nancy
Jane Clark took over her job as
ASSU Public Relations Board di
rector last spring it was, she ad
mitted yesterday, "like plunging
into Lake Lagunita and finding
no water there."
The Public Relations Board, then
a little more than a year old, had
come under fire for not living up
to its original function, that of co
ordinating and regulating ASSU
publicity and public relations.
On top of that it had become the
target for popular criticism inter
mingled with personality conflicts.
To the keen observer and the cas
ual onlooker alike it seemed as |
though the board would soon defeat j
its own purpose and finally disin
tegrate.
Miss Clark, sensing the need for
such an organization on the cam
pus, viewed the Public Relations
Hoard as a "vital and necessary
service" for the ASSU, and ac
cepted the challenge.
"I decided I was going to put on
my Joan of Arc armor and crusade
