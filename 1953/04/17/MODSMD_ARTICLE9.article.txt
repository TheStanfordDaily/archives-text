# IN THE PAVILION
## Slight Girl, Aging Man Set Dramatic Example in Drive 
### LAURI HALE 
It's the little things that make up a Blood Drive; the humorous,
dramatic incidents that have taken place in the Pavilion during
the last four days. Scenes like the following:
"Say, fellow, did they take blood out of you or it in?" in
quired one rather pale Stanford rough to His rosy-cheeked corn-

pan ion eating heartily in the canteen.
A student, seating himself next, to
the rosy-cheeked one, remarked en
thusiastically, "Say, this is just like
a party, and I feel much better than
before I came in."
Jean Gordon, Branner freshman,
looking up sadly from her cot in
the donating room, complained,
"First they stuck one arm and could
n't get enough out of it, so they stuck
the other one. This time there was a
vacuum in the bottle, so I wasn't
even able to fill up one pint. I'll just
j have to give again in three months
to make up for it."
Even Stanford parents arc hack
ing (he Blood Drive. Among the
more than 900 donors who passed
through the Pavilion yesterday
was Mrs. Marjorie Kovncr, the
mother of Ken Schechter.
Mrs. Kovncr has had low blood
pressure; therefore Km had no
idea that she was planning to give
hlood.
Age is no limit to blood donors. A
j Palo Alto man phoned for an ap
; pointment Tuesday, and was re
quested to come on Friday when
they weren't so busy. "But I'll be (50
j on Friday," said the voice on the
other end of the wire.
A 92-pound Roble resident,
realizing that being underweight
is of no advantage during a Blood
Drive, pleaded for two hours with
doctors that she he allowed to
give. Her half-pint is now being
' processed to send to Korea.
For action "above and beyond the
call of duty" a Branner girl was
awarded one of the hlood pins by
an attending doctor. He had defi
nitely refused to allow her to give
blood because of her low blood pros
! sure. For seven hours she begged
him for permission, but he was firm.
Finally, he told her to wear the pin
I descrvingly, as she had earned it,


ON PARADE—As a special reminder of the need of blood for
the armed forces, Stanford's 700-man Air ROTC unit staged a
dress parade in Palo Alto yesterday. All members of the unit
have pledged to serve in the Air Force following graduation.
