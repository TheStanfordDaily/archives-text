# Over and Successful
## 
### 
The "biggest concerted blood drive ever held
in the United States" is over.
From the standpoint of breaking records it
was a whopping success.
From the standpoint of providing a tremen
dous supply of blood for the military it was a
success.
From the standpoint of meeting a goal it was
a small disappointment to many of us, includ
ing Chairman Ken Schechter.
Perhaps most important of all, the drive laid a
good foundation for large campus drives to be
held regularly on campus in the future. It
stands to reason that Stanford can contribute
this tremendous outpouring of blood consist
ently once, or even tv/ice a year.
Deeply felt thanks go to Ken Schechter and
his blood drive committee members for their
tireless work. We don't know the names of
them all, but Dan Wilbur, Dorothy Dodge, and
Leon Perry, at least, put out all kinds of effort.
Thanks also go to the throng of volunteer

Red Cross workers, who put in what must have
been the most strenuous week in their history.
Among those who strove to sign up donors,
we think the 100 per cent living groups, and
also the Biz School were outstanding.
Despite the fact that it is largely composed
of off-campus residents and wholly made up of
graduate men, the biz students' organization,
led by Bill Burke, subscribed 95.2 per cent of
its membership to donate blood: A noteworthy
example of participation in community activi
ties for other graduate organizations to shoot
at in the future.
Notes of praise to each and every one of you
who struggled in varying degrees, either fig
uratively or literally, to donate your blood.
At the risk of being bitter, however, we offer
a thought to those who failed to give, not be
cause they couldn't, but because they wouldn't:
May you never find yourself in a position
where you need a helping hand, a pint of blood,
from someone else.
