### DICK MANSFIELD 
OEDIPUS ZILCH
A Modern Greek Tragedy
Up at Stanford's Psi of lota Psi, the Brothers used
to gather at the feet of Oedipus Zilch and hark to
Ids tales of his way with women.
Oedipus Zilch was the pride of lota Psi because
of his way with women; the brothers loved to boast
of Zilch's mighty deeds. Zilch was (I) masterful:
"Just call me Zilch," he would growl to each adoring
coed; (2) romantic: He played a mighty dexterous

guitar and sang "Juanita" in a
way which utterly incapacitated
Casa Espanol; (3) offhand: "Get
your grubby hook oft' my pin,"
he was known to murmur to
coeds. He had a glib line and
used a quart of Wildroot Cream
Oil a week. Attract 'em? He
knocked 'em dead.
But in the women's row houses,
they finally got edgy. "This
Zilch," they said, "is too glib.

Too confident. Too offhand. He breaks our adoring
girlish hearts. He worries our housemothers. This
Zilch will have to go."
And so, at great expense and unknown lo lota
Psi and Oedipus Zilch, they imported one of those
calm, intellectual Eastern vvomens' college women,
primed her, and sent her on an lota Psi exchange.
Oedipus Zilch, working on a Winning streak, in
troduced himself early in the evening. "Chommed,"
she said. He produced his guitar. Brothers exchanged
knowing winks. Zilch emoted a flatted fifth and sang
"A Woman Is Only a Woman But a Good Cigar Is
a Smoke."

"Say, honey," said the ringer, "Want me to show
you how the chords to (hat go?" Then she lit up
a cigar. The brothers gasped. "The name," said
Zilch with a shudder, "is Oedipus Zilch!" "Hi, Ed
dy," she replied. "Just call me Zilch," he growled.
"Now Eddy," she said, "don't be petulant."
Zilch regrouped. "Let's dance," he said. The lota
Psi Rhythm Boys tore into some up-tempo. "Auu,
them mouldy figs," she said. "But that's the Charles
ton," he said. "Let's hoof." "Your patter's grim,"
she said. "Wait until I finish my cigar." Zilch broke
for the door.
Out in the hall, the Brothers gathered around to
give Zilch the old tong pep talk. "Gotta die for
old Psi!" said someone. "Think they'd ship me to
Korea if I enlisted tonight?" said Zilch. "Get out
there, Zilch." said the rushing chairman, "17 rush
ees' eyes are observing #our technique." "Once more,
then, fellows," he said, squaring his shoulders, "and
if I fail, you can donate me to the blood drive."
Hack into the fray went Oedipus Zilch. He tried
the innocent touch. "Say, you're keen!" he said.
"Well, dig rosy-cheeks!" she said. He tried lowering
his voice and assuming a Bulgarian accent. "Yoo
attragt me," he thundered. "Cute talk, big hoy,"
she said.
Oedipus Zilch made the grand attempt. "Enough;"
he cried. "Give me your hand!" A hush fell over
the assembled Psis.
She stubbed her cigar oyt in his outstretched
palm. •
And the next day. Oedipus Zilch took the guitar to
a pawnshop and turned to his books. The event just
totally cracked him up.

Ids tales of his way with women.
Oedipus Zilch was the pride of lota Psi because
of his way with women; the brothers loved to boast
of Zilch's mighty deeds. Zilch was (I) masterful:
"Just call me Zilch," he would growl to each adoring
coed; (2) romantic: He played a mighty dexterous

guitar and sang "Juanita" in a
way which utterly incapacitated
Casa Espanol; (3) offhand: "Get
your grubby hook oft' my pin,"
he was known to murmur to
coeds. He had a glib line and
used a quart of Wildroot Cream
Oil a week. Attract 'em? He
knocked 'em dead.
But in the women's row houses,
they finally got edgy. "This
Zilch," they said, "is too glib.

Too confident. Too offhand. He breaks our adoring
girlish hearts. He worries our housemothers. This
Zilch will have to go."
And so, at great expense and unknown lo lota
Psi and Oedipus Zilch, they imported one of those
calm, intellectual Eastern vvomens' college women,
primed her, and sent her on an lota Psi exchange.
Oedipus Zilch, working on a Winning streak, in
troduced himself early in the evening. "Chommed,"
she said. He produced his guitar. Brothers exchanged
knowing winks. Zilch emoted a flatted fifth and sang
"A Woman Is Only a Woman But a Good Cigar Is
a Smoke."

"Say, honey," said the ringer, "Want me to show
you how the chords to (hat go?" Then she lit up
a cigar. The brothers gasped. "The name," said
Zilch with a shudder, "is Oedipus Zilch!" "Hi, Ed
dy," she replied. "Just call me Zilch," he growled.
"Now Eddy," she said, "don't be petulant."
Zilch regrouped. "Let's dance," he said. The lota
Psi Rhythm Boys tore into some up-tempo. "Auu,
them mouldy figs," she said. "But that's the Charles
ton," he said. "Let's hoof." "Your patter's grim,"
she said. "Wait until I finish my cigar." Zilch broke
for the door.
Out in the hall, the Brothers gathered around to
give Zilch the old tong pep talk. "Gotta die for
old Psi!" said someone. "Think they'd ship me to
Korea if I enlisted tonight?" said Zilch. "Get out
there, Zilch." said the rushing chairman, "17 rush
ees' eyes are observing #our technique." "Once more,
then, fellows," he said, squaring his shoulders, "and
if I fail, you can donate me to the blood drive."
Hack into the fray went Oedipus Zilch. He tried
the innocent touch. "Say, you're keen!" he said.
"Well, dig rosy-cheeks!" she said. He tried lowering
his voice and assuming a Bulgarian accent. "Yoo
attragt me," he thundered. "Cute talk, big hoy,"
she said.
Oedipus Zilch made the grand attempt. "Enough;"
he cried. "Give me your hand!" A hush fell over
the assembled Psis.
She stubbed her cigar oyt in his outstretched
palm. •
And the next day. Oedipus Zilch took the guitar to
a pawnshop and turned to his books. The event just
totally cracked him up.
