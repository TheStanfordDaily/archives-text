## No Care for Time or Weather 
### 
To the Editor:
I wish to comment about a situation that iflust
have baffled students since the days when Herbert
Hoover was an undergrad.
It seems that irrespective of temperature and wind
conditions, and irrespective of the time of the year
the steam heat is turned on at the same time, and is
turned off at the same time, Pacific Standard, or
Daylight Saving.

The fact that there are times when there is no
need for it, or other times when the need for it is
very great does not seem to concern" one bit the
little men whose duties include the operation of
of the heating facilities. Perhaps they aren't even
aware of the fact that there are days that are warm,
and that there are other days that are cold.
