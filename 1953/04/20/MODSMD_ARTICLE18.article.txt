# STANFORD EXCHANGE STUDENT
## An American in Grenoble 
### JANE LINDEMUTH 
What does the American stu
dent in a foreign country learn
of that country's people and cus
toms? Here, to tell us, are ex
cerpts from letters written to the
ASSU Foreign Scholarship Com
mittee by Ynez Viole, Stanford's
own American in Grenoble.
Ynez is studying modern Euro
pean history at „ the University of
Grenoble in the French Alps.
Says Ynez, "I requested Grenoble
for two reasons: first, because I felt
that if I stayed in Paris 1 should
only improve my American accent
. . . in a small city I should be
forced to use French, and, second,
because I knew that the University
of Grenoble has an excellent Fa
culte des Lettres. . . . Although
Grenoble is the center of French
skiing, this decision was not tinged
by any "snovanism"; having roomed
with the secretary of the Ski Club
(at Stanford) for an entire year. 1
became very tired of the ski rack
I had to carry around all winter.
". . . Grenoble is a wonderful city
for students. Last night the choir
of the University of Copenhagen
was here on concert tour. They
performed in the new municipal
theater, and afterward all students
were invited to a reception in their
honor. ... In France, a student's
card allows him into any museum
at half price and into many thea
ters at special rates . . . railroads
also give a student rate.
"I am living in a French family
(five children ranging from 7 lo
18). They speak no Euglhh . . .
this Is * very beneficial for my
French. I was surprised to dis
cover how little geography they
know. The 15-year-old asked me

if I had ever seen a lemon before,
as he thought California was in
(lie general region of Alaska.
". . . my collection of pet peeves
...(1)1 am very frustrated at not
being able to do the French cross
word puzzles; (2) the French irons
are nothing but hot pointed bricks;
(3) lunch over here is a rite and
this former Unionite accustomed to
"I'll bet I can get home from my
eleven o'clock, have lunch, and get
a hand dealt out before the fire sta
tion horn sounds" finds herself
barely a catechumen in this in
volved ceremony.
"There are no accommodations at
the university for students. All live
either with their family, in a board
ing house, with another family, or
in a rented room. . . . f The student
club ... is a government-spon
sored affair, run entirely by stu
dents, for students, on a national
level and through national subsi
dies. ... It is in these clubs that
one meets other students, and
lunches, if, as most students, one
eats only breakfast and dinner with
the family.
"All student life revolves
around (his club, which is rough
ly equal to the ASSU. To an
American, (he centralization of
(he e clubs, in fact the centraliza
tion of all French education, is
astonishing. One may transfer
from one part of France to another
and lind (he same sort of student
organization as well 'as the same
textbooks in the classes.
". . . the system has its drawbacks,
too. The first I noticed was on
Thanksgiving. The head of the stu
dent clubs, . . . the governing body
in Paris, decided that the social se
curity protection of the A.G.E. (As
sociation Generale des Etudiants)
was not enough ... it railed a
student strike. (Each member of

the A.G.E. has a health protection
plan.) . . . this strike was called
weeks in advance. At the eleventh
hour, it was called off, but the Gre
noble branch was not notified, thus
only Grenoble went through on this
strike. No one was permitted into
the buildings of the university, not
even faculty members . . . the whole
thing became a rather messy farce.
The Americans here can't under
stand, if the conditions of the stu
dents are sc bad, why the individual
student doesn't get a job. All the
service in the A.G.E. restaurant is
paid non-student help. The fact is
that the French student is regarded
a.s a member of a social class which
DOES NOT WORK. This, I will ad
mit, is slowly breaking down, but
it is a startling remnant of the 191 li
century system of education.
"Some of the American students
here, and especially those in Paris,
are . . . giving a wrong impression
of the United States. . . .
"Had an interesting discussion
last week with a French student
on the comparative French and
American systems of education.
This is a country where the intel
lect has been kin# for at least a
century and is now slowly being
dethroned. This, the intellectuals
lament, is the influx of Anicrican
ideas and even American ideals.
"Stalin's death caused various re
actions here. The Communist news
paper sponsored an "homage to Sta
lin" night and the demonstration
turned into a sort of "wake" and
drunken brawl until all hours of the
night. Flags were et half-mast on
all the government buildings, al
though the conservative reaction to
this administrative order was excit
ed. It will be interesting to observe
the reaction in the Communist
newspapers to the death of the
Dowager Queen."

American systems of education.
This is a country where the intel
lect has been kin# for at least a
century and is now slowly being
dethroned. This, the intellectuals
lament, is the influx of Anicrican
ideas and even American ideals.
"Stalin's death caused various re
actions here. The Communist news
paper sponsored an "homage to Sta
lin" night and the demonstration
turned into a sort of "wake" and
drunken brawl until all hours of the
night. Flags were et half-mast on
all the government buildings, al
though the conservative reaction to
this administrative order was excit
ed. It will be interesting to observe
the reaction in the Communist
newspapers to the death of the
Dowager Queen."
What does the American stu
dent in a foreign country learn
of that country's people and cus
toms? Here, to tell us, are ex
cerpts from letters written to the
ASSU Foreign Scholarship Com
mittee by Ynez Viole, Stanford's
own American in Grenoble.
Ynez is studying modern Euro
pean history at „ the University of
Grenoble in the French Alps.
Says Ynez, "I requested Grenoble
for two reasons: first, because I felt
that if I stayed in Paris 1 should
only improve my American accent
. . . in a small city I should be
forced to use French, and, second,
because I knew that the University
of Grenoble has an excellent Fa
culte des Lettres. . . . Although
Grenoble is the center of French
skiing, this decision was not tinged
by any "snovanism"; having roomed
with the secretary of the Ski Club
(at Stanford) for an entire year. 1
became very tired of the ski rack
I had to carry around all winter.
". . . Grenoble is a wonderful city
for students. Last night the choir
of the University of Copenhagen
was here on concert tour. They
performed in the new municipal
theater, and afterward all students
were invited to a reception in their
honor. ... In France, a student's
card allows him into any museum
at half price and into many thea
ters at special rates . . . railroads
also give a student rate.
"I am living in a French family
(five children ranging from 7 lo
18). They speak no Euglhh . . .
this Is * very beneficial for my
French. I was surprised to dis
cover how little geography they
know. The 15-year-old asked me

if I had ever seen a lemon before,
as he thought California was in
(lie general region of Alaska.
". . . my collection of pet peeves
...(1)1 am very frustrated at not
being able to do the French cross
word puzzles; (2) the French irons
are nothing but hot pointed bricks;
(3) lunch over here is a rite and
this former Unionite accustomed to
"I'll bet I can get home from my
eleven o'clock, have lunch, and get
a hand dealt out before the fire sta
tion horn sounds" finds herself
barely a catechumen in this in
volved ceremony.
"There are no accommodations at
the university for students. All live
either with their family, in a board
ing house, with another family, or
in a rented room. . . . f The student
club ... is a government-spon
sored affair, run entirely by stu
dents, for students, on a national
level and through national subsi
dies. ... It is in these clubs that
one meets other students, and
lunches, if, as most students, one
eats only breakfast and dinner with
the family.
"All student life revolves
around (his club, which is rough
ly equal to the ASSU. To an
American, (he centralization of
(he e clubs, in fact the centraliza
tion of all French education, is
astonishing. One may transfer
from one part of France to another
and lind (he same sort of student
organization as well 'as the same
textbooks in the classes.
". . . the system has its drawbacks,
too. The first I noticed was on
Thanksgiving. The head of the stu
dent clubs, . . . the governing body
in Paris, decided that the social se
curity protection of the A.G.E. (As
sociation Generale des Etudiants)
was not enough ... it railed a
student strike. (Each member of

the A.G.E. has a health protection
plan.) . . . this strike was called
weeks in advance. At the eleventh
hour, it was called off, but the Gre
noble branch was not notified, thus
only Grenoble went through on this
strike. No one was permitted into
the buildings of the university, not
even faculty members . . . the whole
thing became a rather messy farce.
The Americans here can't under
stand, if the conditions of the stu
dents are sc bad, why the individual
student doesn't get a job. All the
service in the A.G.E. restaurant is
paid non-student help. The fact is
that the French student is regarded
a.s a member of a social class which
DOES NOT WORK. This, I will ad
mit, is slowly breaking down, but
it is a startling remnant of the 191 li
century system of education.
"Some of the American students
here, and especially those in Paris,
are . . . giving a wrong impression
of the United States. . . .

stand, if the conditions of the stu
dents are sc bad, why the individual
student doesn't get a job. All the
service in the A.G.E. restaurant is
paid non-student help. The fact is
that the French student is regarded
a.s a member of a social class which
DOES NOT WORK. This, I will ad
mit, is slowly breaking down, but
it is a startling remnant of the 191 li
century system of education.
"Some of the American students
here, and especially those in Paris,
are . . . giving a wrong impression
of the United States. . . .
"Had an interesting discussion
last week with a French student
on the comparative French and
American systems of education.
This is a country where the intel
lect has been kin# for at least a
century and is now slowly being
dethroned. This, the intellectuals
lament, is the influx of Anicrican
ideas and even American ideals.
"Stalin's death caused various re
actions here. The Communist news
paper sponsored an "homage to Sta
lin" night and the demonstration
turned into a sort of "wake" and
drunken brawl until all hours of the
night. Flags were et half-mast on
all the government buildings, al
though the conservative reaction to
this administrative order was excit
ed. It will be interesting to observe
the reaction in the Communist
newspapers to the death of the
Dowager Queen."
What does the American stu
dent in a foreign country learn
of that country's people and cus
toms? Here, to tell us, are ex
cerpts from letters written to the
ASSU Foreign Scholarship Com
mittee by Ynez Viole, Stanford's
own American in Grenoble.
Ynez is studying modern Euro
pean history at „ the University of
Grenoble in the French Alps.
Says Ynez, "I requested Grenoble
for two reasons: first, because I felt
that if I stayed in Paris 1 should
only improve my American accent
. . . in a small city I should be
forced to use French, and, second,
because I knew that the University
of Grenoble has an excellent Fa
culte des Lettres. . . . Although
Grenoble is the center of French
skiing, this decision was not tinged
by any "snovanism"; having roomed
with the secretary of the Ski Club
(at Stanford) for an entire year. 1
became very tired of the ski rack
I had to carry around all winter.
". . . Grenoble is a wonderful city
for students. Last night the choir
of the University of Copenhagen
was here on concert tour. They
performed in the new municipal
theater, and afterward all students
were invited to a reception in their
honor. ... In France, a student's
card allows him into any museum
at half price and into many thea
ters at special rates . . . railroads
also give a student rate.
"I am living in a French family
(five children ranging from 7 lo
18). They speak no Euglhh . . .
this Is * very beneficial for my
French. I was surprised to dis
cover how little geography they
know. The 15-year-old asked me

if I had ever seen a lemon before,
as he thought California was in
(lie general region of Alaska.
". . . my collection of pet peeves
...(1)1 am very frustrated at not
being able to do the French cross
word puzzles; (2) the French irons
are nothing but hot pointed bricks;
(3) lunch over here is a rite and
this former Unionite accustomed to
"I'll bet I can get home from my
eleven o'clock, have lunch, and get
a hand dealt out before the fire sta
tion horn sounds" finds herself
barely a catechumen in this in
volved ceremony.
"There are no accommodations at
the university for students. All live
either with their family, in a board
ing house, with another family, or
in a rented room. . . . f The student
club ... is a government-spon
sored affair, run entirely by stu
dents, for students, on a national
level and through national subsi
dies. ... It is in these clubs that
one meets other students, and
lunches, if, as most students, one
eats only breakfast and dinner with
the family.
"All student life revolves
around (his club, which is rough
ly equal to the ASSU. To an
American, (he centralization of
(he e clubs, in fact the centraliza
tion of all French education, is
astonishing. One may transfer
from one part of France to another
and lind (he same sort of student
organization as well 'as the same
textbooks in the classes.
". . . the system has its drawbacks,
too. The first I noticed was on
Thanksgiving. The head of the stu
dent clubs, . . . the governing body
in Paris, decided that the social se
curity protection of the A.G.E. (As
sociation Generale des Etudiants)
was not enough ... it railed a
student strike. (Each member of

the A.G.E. has a health protection
plan.) . . . this strike was called
weeks in advance. At the eleventh
hour, it was called off, but the Gre
noble branch was not notified, thus
only Grenoble went through on this
strike. No one was permitted into
the buildings of the university, not
even faculty members . . . the whole
thing became a rather messy farce.
