# Delegates Weary After Model U.N.
## 
### 
Stanford's Model United Nation,
delegation returned to campus v
terday, feeling tired, triumphant,
and oh so British after spending
three days at Berkeley upholding
the interests of the United King
dom.
Delegates from over 50 VJr i.
Coast schools caucused and haggled
from morning to night trying to
compromise their countries' intei •
ests so that workable resolutions
could be passed.
With its 22 vetoes, one walk out,
and dozens of procedural floor
fights, the conference was a do: -
approximation of the real thing.
Yet within this confining frame
work of realism delegates managed
to pass such controversial resolu -
tions as the submission of the Tu
nisian-Moroccan dispute to the In
ternational Court of Justice; the ap
plication of economic sanction:?
against South Africa within a ./ear
unless she permits an investiga'ion
of race relations; and the formation
of a world police force.
The Russian delegate brought the
house down when he announced
that Russia and her satellite;
wished to join NATO, during an
Assembly debate on regional or
ganizations.
The only motions adopted without
battle were a Swedish resolution
calling for a World Children , 7">.» /,
and a concluding resolution by M -
USSR reaffirming faith in the Unit
ed Nations.
