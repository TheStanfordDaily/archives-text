# UCLA Cindermen Look Good Losing
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
UCLA's high-flying track team did everything but win the meet
over the weekend as the Card depth came through to take the
day, 72-59.
The rambunctious Bruins, practically to the man, gave forth
their top efforts of the season in every event. Top individual per-

formances came from the Bruins' *
Len Eilers, whose 14 ft. 1/16 in.
pole vault broke the meet record of
13 It. 7% in. set by Stanford's Bill
Larson in 1948 and Rod Richard,
double winner in the sprints with
season bests of 9.7 and 21.3.
Richard passed up Stanford's Keith
Brownsberger in the last 20 yards of i
each event to nose out the sopho
more flash twice by no more than
a yard. Maury Parsons came in j
third in the century, three yards !
back, but pulled up lame after 180
yards of the furlong.
Big surprise of the day came in
th»' 880. where UCLA's Jack Sage
came up with the best performance
of his life to run away with the
race at 1:56. Stanford's Dave Flet
cher, one of the hardest workers
on the team, was favored and kept
it close to the finish.
The "Bobbsey Twins," Bob Simon
and Bob Reed, walked home easily
in their mile and two-mile special
ties. Simon, the man that won the
mile and 880 and then came back
for s'/a laps in the two-mile last
week against SC warmed up wrong
for the faster 880 and had to drop
out after the first lap.
Clyde Wetter gave his lifetime
best 51 ft.-!) in. heave in the shot
which was good enough for a sur
prise second between Howie Hertz j
at 53 ft. 11% in. and Boh Mathias .
with !)<) ft. 11 in. Mathias didn't
enter either hurdle event, and took
first in the discus with a 161 ft.-
10% in. effort.
Stanford's big Jerry Wood held
up the high hurdle chores for the [
wounded Mathias by pulling away
from UCLA's Dave Rosellini after I
Rosellini nicked the ninth and tenth j
hurdle. Rosellini came back to nose i
out Stanford's Marty Johnson in the i
low hurdles.
The Stanford quarter mile team
of Fred George and Walt Garrett
came in one-two in the winning
time of 19 Hat while the javelin
team of Chuck Harlow, Bob Kim
ball. and Dick Holmes didn't need
the services of papa Leo Long to
take one-two-three in Stanford's
specialty event.

And to make the day complete,
the UCLA relay team won in a walk
after Stanford conveniently dropped
the baton.

UCLA's high-flying track team did everything but win the meet
over the weekend as the Card depth came through to take the
day, 72-59.
The rambunctious Bruins, practically to the man, gave forth
their top efforts of the season in every event. Top individual per-

formances came from the Bruins' *
Len Eilers, whose 14 ft. 1/16 in.
pole vault broke the meet record of
13 It. 7% in. set by Stanford's Bill
Larson in 1948 and Rod Richard,
double winner in the sprints with
season bests of 9.7 and 21.3.
Richard passed up Stanford's Keith
Brownsberger in the last 20 yards of i
each event to nose out the sopho
more flash twice by no more than
a yard. Maury Parsons came in j
third in the century, three yards !
back, but pulled up lame after 180
yards of the furlong.
Big surprise of the day came in
th»' 880. where UCLA's Jack Sage
came up with the best performance
of his life to run away with the
race at 1:56. Stanford's Dave Flet
cher, one of the hardest workers
on the team, was favored and kept
it close to the finish.
The "Bobbsey Twins," Bob Simon
and Bob Reed, walked home easily
in their mile and two-mile special
ties. Simon, the man that won the
mile and 880 and then came back
for s'/a laps in the two-mile last
week against SC warmed up wrong
for the faster 880 and had to drop
out after the first lap.
Clyde Wetter gave his lifetime
best 51 ft.-!) in. heave in the shot
which was good enough for a sur
prise second between Howie Hertz j
at 53 ft. 11% in. and Boh Mathias .
with !)<) ft. 11 in. Mathias didn't
enter either hurdle event, and took
first in the discus with a 161 ft.-

Stanford's big Jerry Wood held
up the high hurdle chores for the [
wounded Mathias by pulling away
from UCLA's Dave Rosellini after I
Rosellini nicked the ninth and tenth j
hurdle. Rosellini came back to nose i
out Stanford's Marty Johnson in the i
low hurdles.
The Stanford quarter mile team
of Fred George and Walt Garrett
came in one-two in the winning
time of 19 Hat while the javelin
team of Chuck Harlow, Bob Kim
ball. and Dick Holmes didn't need
the services of papa Leo Long to
take one-two-three in Stanford's
specialty event.

And to make the day complete,
the UCLA relay team won in a walk
after Stanford conveniently dropped
the baton.

UCLA's high-flying track team did everything but win the meet
over the weekend as the Card depth came through to take the
day, 72-59.
The rambunctious Bruins, practically to the man, gave forth
their top efforts of the season in every event. Top individual per-

formances came from the Bruins' *
Len Eilers, whose 14 ft. 1/16 in.
pole vault broke the meet record of
13 It. 7% in. set by Stanford's Bill
Larson in 1948 and Rod Richard,
double winner in the sprints with
season bests of 9.7 and 21.3.
Richard passed up Stanford's Keith
Brownsberger in the last 20 yards of i
each event to nose out the sopho
more flash twice by no more than
a yard. Maury Parsons came in j
third in the century, three yards !
back, but pulled up lame after 180
yards of the furlong.
Big surprise of the day came in
th»' 880. where UCLA's Jack Sage
came up with the best performance
of his life to run away with the
race at 1:56. Stanford's Dave Flet
cher, one of the hardest workers
on the team, was favored and kept
it close to the finish.
The "Bobbsey Twins," Bob Simon
and Bob Reed, walked home easily
in their mile and two-mile special
ties. Simon, the man that won the
mile and 880 and then came back
for s'/a laps in the two-mile last
week against SC warmed up wrong
for the faster 880 and had to drop
out after the first lap.
Clyde Wetter gave his lifetime
best 51 ft.-!) in. heave in the shot
which was good enough for a sur
prise second between Howie Hertz j
at 53 ft. 11% in. and Boh Mathias .
with !)<) ft. 11 in. Mathias didn't
enter either hurdle event, and took
first in the discus with a 161 ft.-
10% in. effort.
Stanford's big Jerry Wood held
up the high hurdle chores for the [
wounded Mathias by pulling away
from UCLA's Dave Rosellini after I
Rosellini nicked the ninth and tenth j
hurdle. Rosellini came back to nose i
out Stanford's Marty Johnson in the i
low hurdles.
The Stanford quarter mile team
of Fred George and Walt Garrett
came in one-two in the winning
time of 19 Hat while the javelin
team of Chuck Harlow, Bob Kim
ball. and Dick Holmes didn't need
the services of papa Leo Long to
take one-two-three in Stanford's
specialty event.

And to make the day complete,
the UCLA relay team won in a walk
after Stanford conveniently dropped
the baton.
