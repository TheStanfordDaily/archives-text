the season, Stanford's varsity and
freshman golf teams romped over
two opponents each in matches
played at the Stanford golf course
this weekend.
Paced by Warren Dailey's sensa
tional five-under-par 66, the Card
varsity trounced UCLA, 25 l /2-lVfe.

Stanford's varsity golfers are
scheduled to face a star-studded
San Diego Navy team today on
the Stanford links at 1 p.m.
No one knows exactly who the
Sailors have this year, hut last
year the Navy team was probably
the strongest team in the country
and if any or all of Gene Littler,
Al Mari. Jerry Witt, or Bud llol

the roughest the Cards face all
