## Frosh Have Initial Loss 
### LOU PUJALET 
John Stewart cracked his one- j
week-old record of 6 feet 5 inches
by high jumping 6 feet 6% inches
Saturday afternoon for the out
standing performance of a triangu
lar meet involving the Stanford
frosh against Modesto and Santa
Rosa Junior Colleges.
Coach Ray Dean's cindermen
went down to their first defeat of
the season in one of the closest
freshman meets of the past few rea
sons. Modesto edged past by a slim
65Mj to 63Vi margin. Santa Rosa
finished third with 21 markers.
In the final analysis the Pirates'
superior depth spelled the differ
ence. Coach Ray Dean's thinclads
took seven first places to six for
Modesto and one for Santa Rosa.
The Pirates edged Stanford 6-5 for |
second places and 5-3 for show
money with both teams scoring five
fourth places.
Jim Luttrell and Ralph Love were
double winners for the freshmen.
Luttrell skimmed to an easy win
in both hurdle events and ran a lap
of the relay. Love picked up his
victories in the mile and two-mile
events.
Jim Truher, "iron man" of the
Stanford squad, competed in five
events, personally accounting for
nine points. He finished second in
the *220 and the shot put, ran third
in the 100, and heaved the discus for
a fourth spot. He also anchored the
relay team to victory in the closest
race of the day.
Stanford was five yards behind
going into the last lap of the relay,
at which point Truher jumped into
the lead at the half-way mark and
fought off his Modesto opponent to
win at the finish by two inches.
