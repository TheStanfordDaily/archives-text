Onck thrre was a Biology Professor named Charlie Edwards.
Charlie was a likeable chap, lnit the strain of marking
exams was a little 100 much lor him. Finally, one clay, he
completely flipped his lid. Crawling on his belly, lie informed
startled students and faculty members alike that he was,
indeed, a silkworm!
He hurried to his room, grabbed a spool of silk thread, and
built a huge cocoon around him. Day after day he stayed in
his cocoon, repeating over and over,
"I am a silkworm! 1 am a silkworm! I am a silkworm!"
The other members of the faculty held a meeting to decide
what was to be done with poor Charlie. "I've got it!", cried
Hob Sutton, a physics instructor, leaping to his feet. He
explained his plan . . . and the other professors agreed. They
hurried down to the Van Heusen dealer and bought a few
Vanispun Sport Shirts.
•'Look, Charlie," they said to Professor Edwards. "These
smart new Van 1 leusen Vanispun Sport Shirts look exactly
like silk. They feel like silk. They're handsomely tailored in
the season's smartest new colors. Yet they cost only &4.')5
apiece . . . far less than silk sport shirts. So you see, you're
wasting your time being a silkworm!"
Charlie Edwards peered over the top of his cocoon and
examined the good-looking Van I leusen Vanispun Sport Shirt.
" Egad, you're i iyht!". lie honied, leaping out of his cocoon
and flapping his arms v\iklly. ".Now 1 can turn into a moth
and Hy away!"
