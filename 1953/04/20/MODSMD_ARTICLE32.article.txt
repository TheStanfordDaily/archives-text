## Cards Down Bears, 52-24 
### DON STEVENS 
Winning 10 out of 11 events, the
Stanford swimmers smashed an up
set-minded University of California
squad, 55-29, Saturday in the Indian
pool to run their dual meet win
streak to 21 straight.
The Cards won every event ex
cept the 400-yard relay, in which
they were disqualified for faulty
starts.
Dan Osborne, with 220 and 440
freestyle victories, led the team to
their 38th victory over Cal in the
36-year-old series. The teams have
met twice each season since 1947.
Osborne won the 220 in 2:12.8 and
the furlong in 4:50.
One of the most thrilling races of
the day, witnessed by the 400 spec
tators, was the 200 - yard breast
stroke, in which Cal almost scored
its only legitimate win. The Bears'
Jerry Hays, a (5-3, 210-pounder,
had a clear - cut three - yard lead
over 5-ft.-9, 176—lb. Ashley Jones,
going into the final lap. However,
Hays couldn't match Jones' phe
nomenal closing drive, and had to
relegate himself to a limping, ex
hausted second place.
Displaying the form of an Olym
pic Games gymnast, John Miller
overwhelmingly defeated a quar
tette of Cal divers to capture the
10-meter diving event.
Swimming a different style for
each 50 yards, Jim Gaughran, Stan
ford's most versatile swimmer, cap
tured the 150 medley in the out
standing time of 1:36.4 to beat out
teammate George Mowat and Cal's
Don Smalian.
Jim Lee and Lee Gunnerson
placed one-two in the 100 freestyle,
while Burt Holiday garnered a first
in the 50 freestyle. Gunnerson
placed third, behind Dave Kennell
of California.
Churning the water in the time of
2:16.4, John Weiser windmilled
himself into a first place in the 220-
yard backstroke over the Bears'
Jim Ross and Walt Becker.
Stanford's best, Larry Heim, in
his only race Saturday, paced Jones
and Bob Koll to a 2:58.5 victory in
the 300-yard medley.
Making it a complete California
rout, the Stanford Papooses over
carv«? an early Cub lead to win, 48Vi
to 34*2, in their division, which was
run concurrently with the varsity.
