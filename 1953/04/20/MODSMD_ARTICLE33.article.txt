# Stanford Nine, Broncos Divide
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
The league-leading Stanford baseball team faced the last-place
Santa Clara nine this weekend, and could do no better than an
unimpressive split, dropping the opener, 7-4, and slipping by in
the finale, 8-6.
Meanwhile, the Cal varsity downed UCLA twice, thus drawing

a full game closer. Stanford has
5-and-2 record and the Bears are !
only a half-game behind with a 5- j
and-3 mark.
The good, hut not sensational, i
Bronco team was allowed one
victory and one near-win for two
reasons: lack of heads-up play by
the Indians, and the failure of the
middle part of the hatting order
to come through. The middle
batsmen, Al Talboy, Jack Shep
ard. Chuck IÂ£ssegian, Ray Swarts,
and Dick Cole, registered a total
of three hits in !{5 appearances at
the plate.
The initial game included just
about every play imaginable, all in
favor of the visitors. The contest
included dropped infield pops,
throws to the wrong base, a dropped
ball on a triple steal, and an attempt
to score from second on a wild pitch
that failed completely.
Phil Page started on the hill, and
was relieved by Ken Brown in the
eighth. Page, though he showed his
best control of the year by walking
only two men, was the losing hurl
er.
Don Seybold went the distance
for the visitors and was hit hard
and often, usually for an out. A
number of 400 - foot drives were
hauled in deep in the corners of the
Sunken Diamond, and attempts to
stretch hits also helped the Bronco
cause.
The strangest play of the day,
however, was at home plate. As
an Indian runner slid in and sent
the catcher sprawling, fans saw
the baseball roll out and away
from the cloud of dust.
Suddenly the catcher jumped to
his feet clutching another baseball!
It turned out that in the action the
umpire had dropped one ball, add

ing to the confusion and giving
Stanford fans the momentary im
pression they had scored a run.
Saturday, Bob Murphy went the
distance at Washington Park in
Santa Clara, and, though he weak
ened in the late innings, pulled the
contest out of the fire.
Indian 'jaserunners showed the
Broncos' desperate need for a
catcher in stealing eight base* in
ten attempts. Four of these thefts
wore by Warren Goodrich, setting
a new CIBA record for stolen
bases by one player.
Goodrich was also the "leading
batter for the series, getting five
singles in ten times at bat. Only
two extra-base hits were gathered
by the Indians, a triple by Rich
Scramaglia Friday and a double
by first sacker Hal Hennacy Sat
urday.
The big blow for Santa Clara was
a homer by outfielder Dick Camilli
off Murphy. The Indians had taken
a first-inning 2-0 lead when the son
of ex-major leaguer Dolph Camilli
made it 2-1. The Indians increased
their margin to 8-1 over the next
few frames, and then the Broncos
came to life.
They scored two in the seventh,
three in the eighth, and had the
bases loaded, one out, and Camilli
at the plate in the ninth. Murphy
settled down and retired the side
to give Stanford their victory.
Next weekend, the Indians face
USC for the last time this season
Friday, and play their first contest
against California on Saturday.
Both games are scheduled for the
Sunken Diamond.
