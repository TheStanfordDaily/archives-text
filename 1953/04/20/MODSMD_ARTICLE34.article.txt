# Rev. E.G. Hangen Preaches In Mem Church on Witnesses
## 
### 
In his sermon, "You Are Also a Witness," in Memorial Church
yesterday morning, Rev. Emerson G. Hangen of the First Congre
gational Church of Long Beach, pointed out with reference to
Whitaker Chambers' book, "Witness," how "we are all witnesses
to something" whether we accept it or not, and described some of

the things we should do if we wish
to be Christian witnesses.
First, according to Hangen, "in
order to be an effective witness, we
must have a deep conviction of the
importance of the thing we believe
in and to which we are witnessing."
Next, we should consider the "moti
vation" of our faith—why we hold
it. To be powerful it should be a
"potitive good," and not just a "de
fense - measure against something
else."
Hangen pointed out that one dif
ference in the faith of a Communist
and a Christian is that the first is
to Communism by "despair
at the crisis of history through
which we are passing," but the sec

ond comes to Christianity with
"hope, since he knows he is on the
winning side"—eventually, even if
not right now.
Finally, Hangen said that "an ef
fective witness is thoroughly com
mitted to his faith no matter what
it costs him." Here Christianity
should learn from Communism and
recover the readiness "to dare all
for our faith"—and give to it "un
hesitating loyalty, devotion, and
sacrifice."
