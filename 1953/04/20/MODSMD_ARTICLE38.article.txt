# '06 'Quake: Story of Heroism
## 
### BOB REZAK 
The dramatic story of how the
fast action and quick thinking of
a Stanford fireman saved the
lives of Stanford students and
residents in the 1906 earthquake
unfolded here last weekend.
It was a little-known story told
by a retired Stanford librarian—
Miss Alice Hays—who vividly re
members the havoc and destruction
wrought by the giant temblor 47
years ago.
Last Saturday, on the anniversary
of the April 18, lf)0(>, earthquake
disaster in the Bay Area, Miss Hays
pieced the story together.
After the first shocks of the quake
were felt at 5 a.m., April 18, Otto
Gerdis, a fireman in the Stanford
boiler house, remembered that the
master switch, which controlled
electricity on the campus, was still
open. He ran into the crumbling
building amid the falling debris and
pulled the switch shut.
A few seconds later the boiler
loom came tumbling down on Ger
dis.
Gerdis' heroic act cost him his
life, but saved the lives of Uni
versity students and residents, *
Miss Hays said. The danger of
falling live wires and the threat
of widespread lire was reduced.
At that time, Miss Hays ex
plained, the campus had no gas fa
cilities and used electricity exclu
sively.
Mrs. David Starr Jordan, wife of
Stanford's firat president, later eol

lectcd a fund lor Gerdis' widow.
But in the passage of time, the story
of Otto Gerdis was virtually for
gotten.
"The tragic thing," the retired
librarian added, "was that there
were no communication facilities
left undamaged and Gerdis' fam

ily could not lie notified about his
death."
It was his mother who found his
body in the rubble of the old boiler
house when she came io the campus
'to check on his safety.
A student who lived in Encina,
Miss Hays recalled, was the only
other Stanford earthquake victim.
Miss Hays, who "remembers the
disaster as a "reign of terror," said
the earthquake "shook everybody
together and gave them the cour
age to face difficulty . . . they all
stood together. It was a wonderful
feeling."
Prior to the earthquake, she
said, people were apt to he "peev
ish" or complaining about low
salaries.

Following the carlhqunkc, Miss
Ilaycs said, (lie campus was in a
"state of siege." There were vir
tually no communication facilities.
There were only two automobiles
on the whole campus and one was
being used by its owners, who went
to see the opera in San Francisco.
The other belonged to a Stanford
professor. It was used to carry
messages from Stanford to Sacra
mento for dispatching to students'
parents and relatives. Communica
tion facilities in the earthquake
area were out of commission, said
the former librarian.
Miss Hays also remembered that
Dr. Jordan issued a statement the
morning of the earthquake an
nouncing University work would
resume the next day.
After everybody had surveyed
the damage, however, they knew
that was impossible, Miss Hays
said. In fact, the University closed
down and did not reopen until the
following autumn quarter.
"There was no spring commence
ment that year," Miss Hays added.
"The class of '00 graduated in the
autumn."
