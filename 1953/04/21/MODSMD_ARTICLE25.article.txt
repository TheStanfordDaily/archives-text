# International Friendship
## 
### 
That international athletics create interna
tional friendships has been demonstrated twice
in the past week on the Farm.
First there was the Waseda University,
Tokyo, volleyball team that competed against
the Stanford team last Thursday.
Following the game, the Waseda men were
hosted at the Theta Chi house for dinner. Al
though communication was confined to talking
through interpreters, via sign language or in the
most broken English, the Stanford roughs and
Waseda guests hit it off in fine fashion.
There were formal greetings, eager questions
about the two schools, exchange of songs by
the two groups, and large amounts of folderol
that resulted in the international language,
laughter.
Then came the rugby team from Queens Uni
versity, Belfast, Men fiom this team were
housed over the weekend in the various fra
ternity houses, two to a house.
In this instance, friendships were even easier

because there was no language barrier. And
the cheerful Irish brogue mingled merrily in
dinner table conversations.
One learned, moreover, that these Irish lads
were the very best of party goers, but were
still "plenty fit," as they put it, to completely
outdo the Bay Area's best in the game of rugby.
By the way, there's plenty to be said for sub
stituting English rugby, or its international an
tecedent, soccer, for our American football.
Rugby is a heck of a lot less expensive, more
thrilling when it's played properly, more de
manding physically, and yet more enjoyable
(the Irish lads are thriving on their year-long
round of play, party, study).
But this is getting away from our main point,
which is to suggest to Pub Rel Com or the For
eign Scholar Com that it spend a bit of effort
to see that more athletic teams from countries
abroad come to Stanford while they're barn
storming the U.S.
It's fun to get to know them.
