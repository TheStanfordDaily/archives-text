# Note to the SAB

### 
The student manager has called legitimate
attention to the fact that SAB financial state
ments are no longer published in the Student
Organizations Financial Report.
The practice of including this financial state
ment in the Student Organizations report was
dropped when the intercollegiate athletic pro
gram was reorganized following World War 11.
While the athletic program at Stanford is not
under the direct jurisdiction of the students, as
it is at California for example, the ASSU still
has a very definite interest in the financial situ
ation of the SAB.

The ASSU contributes to the SAB one buck
per quarter from men students and 50 cents
per quarter from women students.
While this amounts to only about $16,000 a
year out of a total SAB budqet of approximately
$450,000, it must be remembered that students
buy a lot of admissions and that the whole pro
gram is run for the benefit of the students.
We firmly believe that the SAB financial
statement and income and expense report
should be included in the Student Organiza
tions Report, and we urge the SAB to have it
included.
