### PETE GROTHE 
SHAKESPEARE BROUGHT TO STANFORD
This morning we depict a scene two waysâ€”the way
it would ordinarily happen, and the way William
Shakespeare would describe it. First, as it would
ordinarily happen:
Student (entering his professor's office): How did
I do on my last midterm?
Professor: I'm afraid you flunked it.
Student: Gosh, did I?

Professor: Yes, you did poorly
on the second essay question.
Student: Well, I'll try to do bet
ter in the next test.
Professor: Yes, I'm sure you
can.
Student: Well, goodbye.
Professor: Goodbye.

If Shakespeare were to come to
Stanford, he would describe the
same scene like this:

(Brutus, the student, knocks on Professor Learo's
door.)
Learo: Pray, enter thou.
Brutus: I extend my thanks to thee, Professor.
Ah, but does not the splendor of this spring day
resemble the sweetness of a maiden of Rally Coin
in white raiments.
Learo: Well said, Brutus.
First Reader: Yea and forsooth.
Second Reader: Verily.
Brutus: Professor, was not the faculty picnic last
weekend? How many sandwiches eatest thou at the
picnic?
Learo: Et tu, Brute.
Brutus: The cause of my appearance here is to
inquire about the state of the grade on my last ex
amination. Were I to fail it I would have to eat the
bitter bread of banishment.
Learo: Oh, gods in heaven, why lie it my duty to

tell him! In the last test, it was as hard for me to
givet'h thee anything above aji F as it is for a
camel to thread the postern of a small needle's eye.
First Reader: Yea and forsooth.
Second Reader: Verily.
Brutus: Oh, a thousand curses! How could thee,
beloved Professor Learo, do thfc to me?
Learo: The quality of grades are not strained. They
droppeth from the reader's pen above upon the grade
sheet beneath. They are twice blessed. It blesseth
him that gives and him that takes. 'Tis the mightiest
in the mightiest. But grades above this sceptred sway;
it is enthroned in the Dean's office forever.
Brutus: To drop the course or not to drop the
course, that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler in
the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous
grades. Or to take arms against a sea of professors.
And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep.
Oh, "A," oh "A,'' wherefore art thou, oh "A."
How far a little candle throws its beams in dark
ness. So shines an "A" in a sea of "F"s.
Learo: Dost thou accuse me, Brutus? I would my
Chevrolet had the speed of your tongue, and so
good a continuer.
Brutus: Oh, tiger's heart wrapped in a professor's
hide. Beware the Ides of midterm periods.
Learo: No, thou wouldn't harm me!
Brutus: Thou hast named it. Rather I he smitten
by a beast than let thee live. (Brutus pulls out a
knife and stabs Professor Learo.)
Learo: Life is as tedious as the lecture of a Bio I
professor vexing the dull ears of a drowsy fresh
man. Just death, kind umpire of man's miseries.
Death, where is thy sting? (He dieth.)
Brutus: It is not that I love Learo less. It is that
I love my grades more. For Learo was an honorable
man.
First Reader: Yea and forsooth.
Second Reader: Verily.
(The curtain droppeth from exhaustion.)
