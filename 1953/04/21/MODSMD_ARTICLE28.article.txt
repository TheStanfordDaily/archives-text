OPEN NOTE OF THANKS TO THE
STANFORD COMMUNITY
First, thanks to the 5,238 people who came in to
donate blood. Each of you has the satisfaction of
knowing that you have helped to provide the gift
of life for an anonymous soldier who was wounded
fighting for you. I'm sure that I speak for each re
cipient of a pint of blood in this.
Secondly, my sincere appreciation to all of the
people who worked so hard and long to make the
drive a success. It is impossible for me to mention
each of the persons individually who contributed
endless hours of work. Without them success of
any kind would have been impossible.
My thanks, too, to the members of the faculty
and staff whose encouragement and cooperation was
invaluable.

One note of collective thanks is due the student
body as a whole, whose spirit and devotion carried
our blood drive to a world's record.
This spirit can be exemplified by the stories of the
girl who had to be lifted from a wheel chair to the
table to donate; the blind student being led into the
pavilion by his seeing eye dog; a co-ed putting ash
trays in her pockets to pass the weight limit; Norm
Standlee coming in to donate even though struck
by polio a short time ago; the people who spent 16
hours a day working in the blood drive office; and
many more glories too numerous to mention. These
people typify the spirit which encompassed every
one in the Stanford Community.
To all of you my sincere appreciation.

To the Editor:
The record breaking blood drive was finished last
week with a remarkable record, and on behalf of
the Palo Alto Chapter American Red Cross I want
to express its appreciation for all that was done to

make it possible. The cooperation of the donors,
students, faculty, and their friends led to a success
that is being recognized nationally as well as locally,
and for which all concerned deserve unlimited credit.
