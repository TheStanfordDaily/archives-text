Stanford graduate student Marty Feldman lias just finished his fourth
year of rugby. In his early Stanford days Marty played football lor the
Indians.
1 asked Marty the other evening what the differences between the two
sports were?
"The biggest difference between football and rugby is the lack of
formality. Rugby is a lot looser all the way around. There isn't as much
pressure put on winning. And the other big difference is that in rugby

everyone gets a chance at carrying the ball.
In football only a handful get to run with the
ball.
"It's really a kick to carry the hall. When
I was playing football here I was a lineman
and never touched the ball. In rugby I have
gotten off on several jaunts. You should see
some of the k ii >'s go. Ted Tanner is really
the terror. There's a footballer whose been
a rock on defense for Stanford and never
carried the ball. Now that he gets the
chance he really loves it."
112 asked Marty if there is any tendency
upon the part of former football players,
when carrying the ball, to slow down when
contact is about to be made because they

are not wearing padding. Actua-lly among the men who double as fflotball
hacks there is such a tendency. ,But linemen who have never been tackled
at all in football run at full speed never thinking that to be hit without
pads might be more punishing than with pads.
And what about the injuries?
Marty, who assisted Chuck Tayloi in coaching the 1948 irosh gridders,
is positive that no padding prevents injuries.
"I agree with our coach, Pete Kmetovic, when he says that it's hard
fiher helmets and shoulder pads that cause injury, not unpadded bodies
colliding. I can say, though, that when there is an injury in rugby, it iÂ£
usually a good one; no sprains or twists, it is usually a clean break.
Stanford has only had two this year, hoth against Cal."
If you ask Marty, he would tell you that he has enjoyed playing rugby
over football mostly because there is no pressure. There is no worrying
about mistakes after they are made. Ruggers orfly practice three times
a week and when they do its scrimmage and not just (drill.
Rugby is a fine conditioner for football. Not only does it have the same
principles of rough, hard play and general tactics but it builds stamina
and endurance.
I asked Marty what type of fellow goes out for rugby?
"There isn't any specific tvpe. Many of them are football players
who are seeking similar exercise in olT season. Most of them are fairly
strong and tall though that isn't always necessary. There was a hoy
out there, (iene Katnik, an outstanding player and he only weighed 1110
pounds. Stamina, if not initially present, will soon he built up for rugby
is a tiring game when played at full speed."
What about the quality of rugby played around here?
"It's about the best there is. Northern California rugby teams are on
the whole the best there are in the United States. The East doesn't have
good teams mostly because they try and discourage football players from
taking part. That is especially true of the Ivy League. Outside of the
U. S. there are teams that are better than anything we can produce but
that is because they grow up with rugby while over here we don't play
rugby until we are grown up."
