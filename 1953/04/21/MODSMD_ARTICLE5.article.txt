# Pianist 'Great' But 'Detached'

### RON ROSEN 
The renowned British pianist,
Cutnar Solomon, gave a recital last
night before an enthusiastic ca
pacity audience in Memorial Audi
torium. The enthusiasm, however,
did not seem to be shared by Mr.
Solomon. For some reason he was
not pleased with the situation he
was in for a good part of the pro
gram.
It could have been the noisy
audience, the piano, the audito
rium, or any number of annoy
ances. Whatever the reason, the
fact remains that Solomon did
not have his heart in his work.
Even this did not prevent some
of the greatness which is his from
breaking through at times.
In the Bach - Liszt Prelude and
Fugue in A Minor, it appeared that
the pianist was either striving too
hard for an organ - like effect or
else was disturbed over something.
The beautiful and deep Sonata in
A Minor by Schubert was charac
terized by perfect balance and a
singing melody line, something
which Solomon never failed to im
part to all the music on his pro
gram.
But the fidgety uneasiness nev
er seemed to leave Solomon in
this or in the following Beetho
ven "Lcs Adieux" Sonata, one of
Beethoven's least inspired crea
tions.
Solomon played it well, if with a
certain detachment which served
neither Beethoven nor Solomon
well.
The high point of the program
was the performance of the Chopin
Ballades, which were given a treat
ment which is not typical, but which
should be copied. The hands were
together at all times, and the senti
mentality was never overdone.
