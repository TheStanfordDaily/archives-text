FREEDOM VILLAGE, Korea,
Wednesday, April 22 (UP)â€”Re
patriated American soldiers said
today 552 sick, wounded, and
starving United Nations prison
ers died on three "death march
es" in North Korea.
Today's exchange of the third
group of sick and wounded Korean
war prisoners began at 9 a.m. (4
p.m. PST) today, but no Americans
were repatriated.
The Communists released 100
Soutli Koreans, iti exchange for 350
North Koreans and J5O Chinese.
Pvt. William Moreland, Atlanta,
Ch., said 411 Allied prisoners died
while being herded on a 300-mile
march in 1951.
Pfc. Roger Herndon, Jacksonville,
Fla., said 40 of the 100 men with
whom he marched perished.
Sgt. Orville R. Mullins, Coving
ton, Ky., said 101 men in his group
died of starvation, dysentery, and
exhaustion during a 45-day march
through snowstorms.
These stories were among many
related by sick and wounded re
leased prisoners. They reported
comrades also had died in starva
tion camps, and said that many
seriously ill soldiers still were be
ing held by the Iteds.
Some of the freed Americans
told of mass atrocities in (be Are
tic winters of 1951 and 1952, and
said they rivaled the Bataan death
march of Americans captured by
the Japanese and the IVlalmedy
massacre in' the Battle of Ihe
Bulge in World War 11.
The stories told by Moreland and
other released men indicated the
Communists do not plan to free all
their sick and wounded prisoners,
as they had agreed to do at. nego
tiations with United Nations com
manders that paved the way for
the exchange that began on Monday.
