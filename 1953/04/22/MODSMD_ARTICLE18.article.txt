# What's Ahead for Grads?

He calls us boys, not men.
He is Maynard K. Boring, who summarized
the goods, bads, and prospects of current col
lege and high school graduates pretty neatly
in the last U.S. News and World Report.'
Boring, manager of General Electric's tech
nical personnel divisions, was interviewed
concerning technical men chiefly, but much of
what he has said has more general application.
First off, how do our elders view our tools for
a career after college? Boring says that "bas
ically they (youngsters of today) are better"
than those of a decade or two ago.
He states that he is "all for the young fellow
of today," as being "two-fisted, willing to fight
for hie rights."
We apparently lack certain of the rudiment
ary principles of living, for Boring states "most
of the things they have trouble with are the
things they should have learned at their moth
ers' knees when they were 5 or 6 years old."
Boring becomes another of the growing
chorus to criticize the failing of the universi
ties to include enough humanities courses in
technical programs, when he declares that fail
ures among the 12,000 men he has brought into
the scientific field since 1922 have all been in
human relations problems, in one form or an
other.
Other cogent points that he makes are as
follows:

1. Starting salaries in technical fields have
apparently stabilized at the highest rates they
have ever reached.
2. The future of technical men seems well
established, because even though greater num
bers of college freshmen are embarking on
technical courses, the percentage of attrition is
growing because of* lack of background and
preparation.
3. Since there is a very pressing need for the
services of technical men on the home front at
the present, graduates may very well be better
off to go to work for six months or a year before
being drafted.
4. General Electric, and presumably other
big companies, since they are "all in the same
boat," pays more to a returning veteran than a
man fresh out of college, even though neither
of them may have had any actual experience.
5. Companies are having a tough time locat
ing returning veterans, since they "bolt to their
homes," once they are separated from the
"mess."
6. Boys graduating from high school would
be better off going directly into the service in
stead of trying to get a year or two of college
before being drafted. These boys would be
more mature college students after their serv
ice.
