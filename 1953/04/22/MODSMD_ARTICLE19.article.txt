# CAMPUS OPINION
## The 						V-Ball Team Is Good 
### 
EXCERPTS FROM LETTER TO AL MASTERS,
DIRECTOR OF ATHLETICS
Dear Mr. Masters:
I have just recently returned from the Far Western
States volleyball championship played at the Uni
versity of California and I wish to compliment you
on the very excellent volleyball team which Stanford
University had in competition there.
1 thought I should express the hope and wish that
somehow your team could make the trip to Omaha,
Nebraska and Boystown, to play in the National Inter
collegiate Championships which will be held there

May G. UCLA, Florida State, Earlham College, Spring
field College, University of Mexico, University of Min
nesota, Tennessee, Dartmouth, and many other well
known universities are usually represented, and I am
convinced that your boys would make a very fine
showing. As coach of the team that has won the Na
tional O'pen Championship for the last two years, I
think I can recognize good volleyball players when I
.see them and your school is fortunate in having them.
