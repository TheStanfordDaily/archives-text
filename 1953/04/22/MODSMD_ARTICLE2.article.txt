analysis, and related studios.
The new program will begin
with extensive surveys of popu
lation and economic trends in Ihc
Ray Area. Then the planners will
define Ihe size and location of
residential, commercial, indus
trial, recreational, civic, school,
and other areas in the Stanford
development.
Preparation of the master plan
is expected to require about a year,
according to Alf E. Brandin, execu
tive officer at Stanford for land de
velopment.
Priority will be given to certain
sections, however, and it. is hoped
the necessary data on these areas
will bo available in four months.
One of the priority areas in
cludes the proposed $ I.>.000,000
shopping center on El Camino <
Real north of Palo Alto Hospital,
an adjoining site for office build
ings, and a thin strip of land be
tween El Camino Real and the
Southern Pacific tracks immedi
ately north of San Francisquito
Creek.
The other areas being giyen
precedence arc near the southern
boundary of Stanford land.
They include an apartment, site
along California Avenue adjacent to
College Terrace; a light industry
area fronting on El Camino Real,
roughly split in two by the tracks
of the Southern Pacific line to Los
Gatos; and a residential area along
both sides of Junipcro Serra Bou
levard between Arastradero Road
and Matadero Creek.
With the exception of the shop
ping center, the boundaries of
Ihc priority areas arc to be rec
ommended by the master plan
ners. Sixty acres have been des
ignated at this time for the shop
ping center.
One year from now is the tar
ed date for breaking ground on
the shopping ccnter, Brandin de

Within the area being studied for
light industry arc the million-dollar
Varian Associates electronic labora
tory, now nearing completion, and
the site on Page Mill Road of the
