# Shaw Comedy to Feature Authentic Costumes, Sets
## 
### 
Authentic period settings and costumes will highlight the Stan
ford Players' production of "Man and Superman," to be presented
April 30, May 1, and May 2 in Memorial Auditorium.
A 1902 Rambler will play a prominent part in the play's action,
and the ladies in the cast will wear the Gibson Girl outfits popular
in the late 1800's and early 20th *

century.
The play proper deals with a
"superman" theme first advanced by
Nietzsche. However, the action is
on a far from philosophical plane,
being concerned mainly with the
efforts of Jack Tanner (Ross Dur
fee) to escape the matrimonial in
tents of Ann Whitefield (Virginia
Royce).
Tanner expounds some of his
revolutionary theories to a highly
scandalized Roebuck R a ms d c n
(Jay Hern), who is a hide T bound
reactionary of the first water.
Also taking important parts in the
action are Octavius Robinson (Mau
rice Warner), a good-hearted young
man in love with Ann, and his spir
ited sister Violet (Astrid Willsrud).
Other members of the cast are
Richard Learman, James Barton,
Ron Fineberg, Doris Church, Ann
Farrefl, and Judith Doty.
The play is being directed by
I)r. A. Nicholas Vardac, and the
costumes are being designed by
Hugo Melchione. Wendell Cole is
designing the scenery.

Tickets are on sale for $1 at the
Memorial Auditorium box office, DA
3-0G65, or the Peninsula Box Office
