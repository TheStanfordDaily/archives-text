A jeep is a handy vehicle to
have around when you are
charged by an angry rhinoceros.
At least Encina freshman Da
vid Duff thought so when he
irked one of the massive beasts
while taking pictures of African
wildlife last December.
At one moment the rhino was a
placid model; in the next his stump
legs were churning toward Dave
with all the speed his six-foot-tall
body could muster — and rhinos
have been clocked at 35 m.p.h.
Flanked by his father, an older
brother, and a white hunter, Dave
leaped into their jeep and roared
away, a scant 10 yards in front of
the outraged animal. The group
escaped unharmed, and the beast
returned to his jungle home, un
photographed.
All this happened at the Ngoro
ngoro Crater, 200 miles from Nai
robi, Africa. Dave had joined his
brother Arthur, a 20-year-old pre
med student at the University of
New Zealand, and his father for a
.six - week tour of Africa. Their
purpose? To shoot as many animals
as possible—with a camera. During
the trip Art shot over 5,000 feet of
16-mm. color film. '
The Ngoro - ngoro Crater is
home to 15,000 elephants, lions,
buffalo, antelope, gazelles, leop
ards and smaller animals. The
government has declared the 40-
inile-wide area a game preserve
to protect several near-extinct or
unusual species.
A common sight were herds of
"wildebeests," animals described by
Dave as "looking like a whole lot of
animals put together." He said they
have the mane and* size of a small
horse, with a cow's body, horns,
tail, and legs.
January found the trio hiking up
the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro,
which rises 19.565 feet above the
tangled green of the jungles. They
spent 10 days exploring the moun
tainside and peering down through
the ever-present clouds.
A second excursion took Dave
and his father to Zanzibar, a flat,
rocky island off the coast of East
Africa.
"Arabs and cloves" describe the
small island, which is governed
by a sultan. Arabs swarm into
(he former slave port to sell iv
ory, while natives toil to produce
80 per cent of the world's supply
of cloves.
From December to February Af
rica enjoys its warm, dry season.
Safaris usually are made during this
period, since the March rain.s trans
form the twisting dirt roads into an

impenetrable morass.
Both neophytes and veterans of j
many African skirmishes are out- j
fitted with everything from mos
quito netting to native guides by
the Safari Equipping Company in
Nairobi. All safaris must be organ- I
iz.ed under the direction of this
company.
Throughout his stay Dave was

pleasantly surprised to find that
Africa isn't as inhospitable as most
Americans believe it to be. Unless
they were far inland, there was al
ways a hotel to sleep in at night.
And the food was both good and
inexpensive.
"I guess my main complaint, be
sides the heat, was the lack of
good drinking water," he re
called. "Many times we hail to do
without water because we couldn't
find any we knew was pure."
Though the trip was worth the
effort—and the 15 pounds he lost,
Dave considers coming home the
best part of all. "I have never been
as glad as I was to get back to
Stanford spring quarter. Compared
to Africa, Encina is heaven!"

A jeep is a handy vehicle to
have around when you are
charged by an angry rhinoceros.
At least Encina freshman Da
vid Duff thought so when he
irked one of the massive beasts
while taking pictures of African
wildlife last December.
At one moment the rhino was a
placid model; in the next his stump
legs were churning toward Dave
with all the speed his six-foot-tall
body could muster — and rhinos
have been clocked at 35 m.p.h.
Flanked by his father, an older
brother, and a white hunter, Dave
leaped into their jeep and roared
away, a scant 10 yards in front of
the outraged animal. The group
escaped unharmed, and the beast
returned to his jungle home, un
photographed.
All this happened at the Ngoro
ngoro Crater, 200 miles from Nai
robi, Africa. Dave had joined his
brother Arthur, a 20-year-old pre
med student at the University of
New Zealand, and his father for a
.six - week tour of Africa. Their
purpose? To shoot as many animals
as possible—with a camera. During
the trip Art shot over 5,000 feet of
16-mm. color film. '
The Ngoro - ngoro Crater is
home to 15,000 elephants, lions,
buffalo, antelope, gazelles, leop
ards and smaller animals. The
government has declared the 40-
inile-wide area a game preserve
to protect several near-extinct or
unusual species.
A common sight were herds of
"wildebeests," animals described by
Dave as "looking like a whole lot of
animals put together." He said they
have the mane and* size of a small
horse, with a cow's body, horns,
tail, and legs.
January found the trio hiking up
the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro,
which rises 19.565 feet above the
tangled green of the jungles. They
spent 10 days exploring the moun
tainside and peering down through
the ever-present clouds.
A second excursion took Dave
and his father to Zanzibar, a flat,
rocky island off the coast of East
Africa.
