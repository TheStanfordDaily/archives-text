night. ,
Hick Carver and Eric Wittenberg, j
both Zetes, tied for scoring honors I
for the evening with 14 points each, j
Leo Schwaiger and Sterling Clay- i
ton paced the losers, both garner- I
ing 12. Half-time favored the win
ners, 21-19.

intervals and his teammate lan [
Hall swiped most of the loose balls
taken from the hustling Zetes.
The Zetes moved into a quick j
first-huarter lead on the shooting
eyes of Kick Carver and John
Sinie and a liberal sprinl' CI g of

a slow, deliberate style of play,
contrasting with the Zetes' fre
huent use of the fast break.
The final period was the big one
for the Zetes, as they ran the count
up to 38-29 before Schwaiger finally
cracked the Kappa Sig scoring
drought with just three minutes re
maining in the ball game. Hick Car
ver and Wittenberg led the fast
break attack for the Zetes.
