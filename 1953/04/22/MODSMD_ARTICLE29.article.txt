# Pitchers, Hitters Fail, Cards Nine Loses, 11-2
## 
### RUSS WILKS 
Stanford's seemingly lack-lustre,
spiritless baseball team, dropped its
fourth game out of the last five,
yesterday bowing to a mediocre San
Jose State nine 11-2, at the Sunken
Diamond.
Everett Dean attempted to get by
the Spartans with his second line
hurlers, and had to use his top gun
ners in the end. In all, five pitchers
were paraded to the hill. Don Delong
headed the brigade and 'hurled three
impressive innings of one-hit ball.
Ken Brown took over for the
next three, gave up three runs,
one an inside-the-park home run
by thirty-two year old Ralph Cle
land, and was the eventual loser.
Mike Acker was next and lasted
one-third of an inning shedding
three runs, three hits and three
walks. Phil Page relieved and in
his brief tenure retired the five
batters be faced, fanning two.
Bob Murphy toiled the ninth and
was bombed for five runs and four
hits in addition to errors by Ray
Swarts and Warren Goodrich.
The Spartan stickmen pounded out
eleven hits making them all count
for runs. State also made good use
of seven walks, three Indian errors of
commission and several errors of
omission.

Although Stanford appeared as if
they no more belonged on top of the
CIBA heap than Mudville, all was
not black. In the very first inning
the Indians threatened to chase
southpaw John Oldham off the
mound. With two dead, Tom Dan
durand unloaded a 440-ft. triple to
center field. Jack Shepard and
Chuck Essegian then drew free pas
ses from Oldham to load the sacks,
but the lanky junior weathered the
pending storm and struck ofH.Swarts.
However, the Cards weren't to
be denied in the third. Goodrich
walked, stole second with one out
and beat the Spartan's third sack
er to the base on Shepard's infield
grounder as Shep reached first
safely on the fielder's choice. After
Shepard stole second, Essegian
spiked a sharp single to left bring
ing both runners home.
At this point Oldham locked the
barndoor, faced 22 men in the next
six innings, fanned six, gave up
three walks and allowed two hits.
In all, Oldham fanned ten, walked

eight and gave up five hits. Essegian
garnered two of these hits (both
singles) and collected two of the
walks for a perfect day at the bat.
In addition to Dandurand's potent
blow, Hal Hennacy and Rioh Scra
maglia banged out singles.
For the visitors, who batted
around in two different innings,
Dick Brady, Dud Boehner and Cle
land were the big guns. Brady
while knocking in two runs ac
quired three singles, while Boeh
ner, who started his first game as
an outfielder but who usually pit
ches, rammed home four runs with
a single and double. Cleland. aside
from his circuit swat, contributed
J a single to the cause.
It was San Jose's first win of the
i year over Stanford. They had pre
viously dropped two tilts.

his brief tenure retired the five
batters be faced, fanning two.
Bob Murphy toiled the ninth and
was bombed for five runs and four
hits in addition to errors by Ray
Swarts and Warren Goodrich.
The Spartan stickmen pounded out
eleven hits making them all count
for runs. State also made good use
of seven walks, three Indian errors of
commission and several errors of
omission.

Although Stanford appeared as if
they no more belonged on top of the
CIBA heap than Mudville, all was
not black. In the very first inning
the Indians threatened to chase
southpaw John Oldham off the
mound. With two dead, Tom Dan
durand unloaded a 440-ft. triple to
center field. Jack Shepard and
Chuck Essegian then drew free pas
ses from Oldham to load the sacks,
but the lanky junior weathered the
pending storm and struck ofH.Swarts.
However, the Cards weren't to
be denied in the third. Goodrich
walked, stole second with one out
and beat the Spartan's third sack
er to the base on Shepard's infield
grounder as Shep reached first
safely on the fielder's choice. After
Shepard stole second, Essegian
spiked a sharp single to left bring
ing both runners home.
At this point Oldham locked the
barndoor, faced 22 men in the next
six innings, fanned six, gave up
three walks and allowed two hits.
In all, Oldham fanned ten, walked

eight and gave up five hits. Essegian
garnered two of these hits (both
singles) and collected two of the
walks for a perfect day at the bat.
In addition to Dandurand's potent
blow, Hal Hennacy and Rioh Scra
maglia banged out singles.
For the visitors, who batted
around in two different innings,
Dick Brady, Dud Boehner and Cle
land were the big guns. Brady
while knocking in two runs ac
quired three singles, while Boeh
ner, who started his first game as
an outfielder but who usually pit
ches, rammed home four runs with
a single and double. Cleland. aside
from his circuit swat, contributed
J a single to the cause.
It was San Jose's first win of the
i year over Stanford. They had pre
viously dropped two tilts.

Stanford's seemingly lack-lustre,

fourth game out of the last five,
yesterday bowing to a mediocre San
Jose State nine 11-2, at the Sunken
Diamond.
Everett Dean attempted to get by
the Spartans with his second line
hurlers, and had to use his top gun
ners in the end. In all, five pitchers
were paraded to the hill. Don Delong
headed the brigade and 'hurled three
impressive innings of one-hit ball.
Ken Brown took over for the
next three, gave up three runs,
one an inside-the-park home run
by thirty-two year old Ralph Cle
land, and was the eventual loser.
Mike Acker was next and lasted
one-third of an inning shedding
three runs, three hits and three
