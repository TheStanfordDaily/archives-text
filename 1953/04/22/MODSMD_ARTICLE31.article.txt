# Frosh Baseballers Down S.I.
## 
### 
Stanford's frosh baseballers paused
to take a deep breath with a 7-1 lead
in the fifth yesterday and the de
fense promptly fell apart. But the
Papooses hung on to salvage their
seventh straight win, 8-5, from St.
Ignatius High.
The Wildcats from San Francis
co took advantage of seven hits
and nine Stanford hobbles to keep
Papoose hurler Al Dunn constantly
on the ropes in the last three
112 rames.
But an early - inning display of
batting power, featured by Rocky
Furst's home run in the first, stood
up in the end.
Furst's four-base swat, a towering
drive to deep center, followed George
Selleck's lead-off single and sent the

| frosh off to a flying start.
Furst started a four-run rally in
the third as he opened the inning
by reaching first when hit by a
pitch. A St. Ignatius defensive
lapse allowed Furst to take second
when the catcher's return toss to
the pitcher rolled into center field.
Ron Witort then singled in Furst,
! Pete Dahl doubled in Witort, Marc
Sandstrom singled in Dahl, Selleck
singled in Sandstrom, and the frosh
I were on top 6-0.
Dahl's infield hit scored Furst with
another marker in the fourth. —B.W.
