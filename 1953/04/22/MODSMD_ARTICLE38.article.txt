awaxe of the duties and responsi
bilities I would be assuming in of
fice and am prepared to work con
scientiously for you.—Don Lozab
nick, candidate for ASSU president

The ASSU president is your per
sonal representative to the Excom,
to the administration, and to the
alumni and friends of Stanford. I

groups because it is so essential in
maintaining the high level of pres
tige and respect that Stanford now
enjoys. — Larry Keating, candidate

To serve and guide are the
pledges I make as ASSU presiden

and cars of the campus, the presi

sive to the students' wishes. Con
fident in my ability to make this of
fice work for you, I welcome your

The office of vice-president of the
ASSU means a great deal of work.
I don't believe—l know that I can
fill the post well. Girls have had
this office for as long as I can re

it's time for a change.—Larrie Min

The best way to create more "so

among social chairmen and more
efficient planning of social func

student body demands a more uni

going to have successful activities.
I want very much to accomplish
this next year as ASSU vice-presi
