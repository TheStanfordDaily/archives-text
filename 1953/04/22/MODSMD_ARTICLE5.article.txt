# Palm Fire Suspects To Be Quizzed
## 
### 
Two Lower Row men, suspectcd
of incinerating a towering palm
tree in front of the Beta house on
Lasuen and Arguello early yester
day morning, will be questioned by
Chief Gordon Davis today for pos
sible charges of arson.
The two men were noticed near
the scenc of the fire as Stanford's
fire department fought for 2ft
minutes to control the second and
more serious palm tree blaze
within a week. Last Thursday two
other palm trees in front of the
Beta house were nearly destroyed
in what Chief Davis described as
"just a prank."
Yesterday's fire was reported
shortly after 2 a.m. by a police
patrolman. Fire Chief John Marston
said the high flaming palm easily
could have ignited the roofs of sur
rounding residences if "the wind
had been a little stronger."
Marston reported that one stu
dent fireman narrowly escaped in
jury as a burning palm frond fell
to the ground in front of him.
Chief Davis said I here were
strong indications that the tree
was set ablaze as the result of a
senseless impulse, probably after
"some late-hour drinking."
Both Davis and Marston have
recommended that the houses on
the Row trim the bases of their
palm trees to avoid future fires.
