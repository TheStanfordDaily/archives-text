## 
### 
"You've been asking for lots of iokes and now you've got 'em," is the
smug retort of the Old Boy regarding today's exchange issue of the
Chappie.
Underneath the livid green and "simply weird" cover of (he issue
lies the best stories, art features, and cartoons gleaned from 3(1 leading
collcge humor magazines. The outstanding feature will be the large
center spread on the sensational and infamous trial of Mickey Jclkc,
showing vice in full spring-time bloom.
The Chappie will also contain four yuk pages, and a story of the
California Pelican entitled "Stamp Out TV," an art feature from the
Yale Record, not to mention an additional generous sprinkling of ex
change cartoons and jokes.
The Chappie will be sold at the four corners of Quad, the Cellar, and
the Library for 30 cents.
