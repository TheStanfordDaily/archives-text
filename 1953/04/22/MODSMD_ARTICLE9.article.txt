# TUESDAY SERIES
## Hilton: Censorship Shrouds Spain's Cultural, Political Life 
### GLORIA BRECKENRIDGE 
"The academic and political life of present-day Spain is shroud
ed in a nebulous cloud," Ronald Hilton, professor of Hispanic-
American studies at Stanford, told the audience of the Tuesday
Evening Series last night.
As an example of this view he related a story told him by Ortega

y Gassett, whom he saw recently in
Spain. Ortega told of a beautifully
constructed and ornate bridge in a
certain area of Spain. The only
thing wrong is that there is no
longer a river running underneath.
It is the same with the Spanish uni
versities. Just as the river has
changed its course, so have the in
tellectual needs of Spain changed,
but the universities remain the
same.
Professor Hilton cited the many
facets of censorship that cover
Spain today. Newspapers and books
remain under careful scrutiny of
the church and Franco's govern
ment.
A number of pressure groups—
the fascists, the army, the monar
chists, and the clericals—all exert
a specific influence over the po
litical life of Spain, be said.
Consequently, he continued, Spain
has no culture but its own.
In foreign relations, Spain is per
haps more antagonistic toward
France than any other country.
These two countries differ particu
larly in their view toward religion,
France taking the more liberal and

intellectual outlook on Catholicism.
Spain, however, is very friendly to
ward the Moslem nations.
The political feelings of the Span
ish population seem to be divided
into three groups, he continued:
those who support Franco's govern
ment, those who avoid all connec
tion with politics, and the liberal
element, from the upper middle and
professional class who oppose Fran
co.
Communism is a phenomenon
which takes a sharp eye to discover,
lie concluded, and, at present, i:> not
an organized force.
