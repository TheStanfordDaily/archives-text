In a tangle of confusion aacl
clarifications Excom last niqht
invalidated yesterday's elec
tions for Men's and Women':)
Councils and graduate Excorri,
These elections will bo hold again
in Wednesday's final elections, when
other primary results will be run
off.
Excom also passed a clarification
of voting rules last night, :*ayin£;
that in Wednesday's election all sen
iors will be allowed to vote for
graduate and living group represen •
tatives to Excom and for Men's and
Women's Councils.
Jim Madison, Daily editor,
brought the question of senior
voting before Excom, after Daily
reporters received reports that
some seniors had not been al
lowed to vote for any officers ex -
cept ASSU president and vm-c
-president and head cheer leadei
Election Board officials admitted
that they were confused over th<?
regulations. According to the re
port on last year's election, senior;
were allowed to vote on "ASSU of
fices."
But no one knew which office,
were "ASSU" and which were not.
Students manning the polls had
originally been told that senior,
could not vote for the Councils and
Excom offices unless they were re •
turning to graduate school next
year.
Tbc Village Excom race be
came confused, too, when Fran
Kirk, graduate representative l<»
Excom, asked why John Brooke's
name had not been read with (ha(
of the other defeated write in
candidates. Kirk said he knew of
a( least 40 write-in votes for
Brooke.
After shuffling through their
papers, Election Board officials
found that Brooke had received
54 write-in votes, and agreed Ihal
his name should be included on
next week's ballot.
Thornton Garrett, Election Board
chairman, pointed out that morn
students voted in the Council elec
tions, from which seniors were pre -
sumably banned, than in cither the
vice-presidential or the cheer le;id
er elections, in which all senior
who wanted to were allowed to
vote.
Madison said that he was not call«
ing for the invalidation of living
group elections to Excom because,
he did not believe that the number
of seniors deprived of their vof<-
was large enough to change the re
sults of those elections.


CASTING THE "SHORT" BALLOT—Ed Hagen, German foreign
scholar, cast his vote in yesterday's ASSU primary. Hagen was
one of the 3,111 students who voted. Both the ASSU president
and vice-president were elected in the primary.
