"On the sunny side of the street."
Actually in this case it will be "stadium," as
Director of Athletics A 1 Masters told us yester
day that ticket arrangements will provide for
the student body sitting on the sunny side of
Stanford Stadium during this fall's football
schedule.
We hasten to applaud the action for several
reasons. Chief among these is the fact that in
the past Stanford has been subjected to a fair
amount of criticism among its gridiron rivals
because the ASSU has been sitting in the shade
both at home games and at games away.
Heretofore, only with California have we
practiced the almost universal custom of "vis
iting schools sit in the shade."

UCLA and USC come to town and sit in the
sun, and when Stanford goes south the south
ern schools still sit in the sun.
Stanford is the only school in the Pacific
Coast Conference which has maintained the
practice of sitting in the shade at home games.
The various alumni, Block S, Buck Club, and
other ticket holders associated with Stanford
will continue to sit in the shade, so for the first
time in Stanford history these groups will be
able to hear the cheers and see our card stunts.
Of course, the student body will be consid
erably warmer sitting in the sun.
So, more tanned and better hosts, we'll see
you on the sunny side next fall.
