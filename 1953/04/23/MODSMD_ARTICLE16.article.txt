# Summer Fun
## 
### 
Bill Wassman, in charge of the lIR Travel
Bureau, dropped in to the office yesterday to
let us know there are still 11 places open on
"The Grand Stanford Tour."
Nineteen persons have already made firm
reservations for this tour, which will travel
through 12 European countries in 75 days.
The cost of the ASSU-sponsored tour is
$1,185, including round trip by air from New
York, or $1,435 from San Francisco.
John H. Trueman, instructor in Western Civ,
will serve as guide of the tour, while Dr. Wayne
Vucinich will pick up the group in its travel
through Yugoslavia.
We think the tour, the first travel tour ever to

be sponsored by the ASSU, provides a grand
opportunity to spend a summer in company
with friends from the Farm, and recommend
that interested persons contact Mr. Trueman
in his office, Room 200, before the sign-up dead
line of May 1.
Anther opportunity fox vacationing with
Stanfordiles this summer exists with the first
season of the Stanford Summer Camp.
The camp, organized by the Alumni Associa
tion for Stanford alumni, staff, and students, is
located by Fallen Leaf Lake in the Sierra,
It promises to be a darn nice place, have darn
good people, and be darn good fun.
More information can be had at the Bowman
Alumni House.
