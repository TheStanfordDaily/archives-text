## Criticism of Critic "We. Ask Mr. Rosen ...‚Äù 
### 
To the Editor:
We, the undersigned, desire to raise the following
questions. We should like to know the authority for
Mr. Ron Rosen's statement that the Les Adieux Sonata
is "one of Beethoven's least inspired creations." If
the authority is merely the strength of Mr. Rosen's
own impressions, we should like to suggest that per
haps the student body has already been subjected to
more than it can decently abide of Mr. Rosen's im
pressions.
We should like to know what Mr. Rosen means
when he says that "the hands were together at all
times" in the performance of the Chopin
furthermore, we should like to know who told Mr.
Rosen that the Ballades are sentimental. In short, we
desire to know all these things, but we ask for no
answer, lest Mr. Rosen merely compound his errors
in replying; for we believe that music, as much as
the other arts, is a matter of professional concern,
and that points of interpretation and judgment,
whether of the music itself or of the performance
given to it; belong properly to the man who has the
professional competence from which to speak.
The arts are not for amateurs; they belong to those
who know enough to grant the respect due to them,
a respect which first of all manifests itself in critical
humility. The air of injured professionalism so notice
able in the review might have been proper to Olin
Downes, to Claudia Cassidy, or to Alfred Franken
stein, although even that may be doubted, but it
was certainly not proper to Mr. Rosen's condition of
knowledge. '
What we look for in those less adequately prepared
to speak is a becoming humility toward that which
requires deference and regard because it is the
product of a mind greater than any of ours, but we
find that we are asked to content ourselves with

pride and arrogance. Wp do not believe that more
need Ije said.
