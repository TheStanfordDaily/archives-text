# Didn't Hear Faults

### 
To the Editor:
The capacity audience which cheered Solomon,
the British pianist, Monday night in Mem. Aud. left
for home woefully unaware of his pianistic inade
quacies.
Your critic states that the artist had "fidgeted un
easily through a program which included the sonata,
opus 81a ("Les Adieux"), "one of Beethoven's least
inspired creations." He had played w.ith a "certain
detachment" and might have been "disturbed over
something." Only a most sensitive and acutely geared
pair of ears could have detected these faults, in our
opinion. We didn t hear them, nor did other members
of the large audience.
Others seemed to listen, for example, as if literally
spellbound by one of Beethoven's greatest sonatas,
composed during the period of the "Kreutzer" sonata
(Opus 47) and the "Waldstein" sonata (Opus 53),
and played by an expert musician and technician.
Such playing of Beethoven is heard once in a life
time. A past generation can recall Anton Rubinstein,
Busoni, d Albert. Paderewski, Rachmaninoff, and other
pianistic giants, but ours can't.
We consider ourselves fortunate to have heard
Solomon in Mem. Aud. Monday night. This was
musicianship and pianism in the much - heralded
grand manner. We regret that your cri,tic was unfor
tunate enough to have missed most of this.
