# ‘Lucky or Unfair?’
## 
### 

HAPPY ANNIVERSARY—Yesterday was the year-and-half an
niversary of the picketing of the Electric Kitchen in Palo Alto
and manager Mrs. Allean Dacus hung out a dummy to celebrate
the date. The sign near the dummy attracted the attention of
three union agents from San Francisco, as well as daily passers
by, according to Mrs. Dacus. The sign reads: . They call
rne 'unfair' . . . when I entered I discovered the man with the
sign had been running in so much business they needed help
and they paid me more than what the union offered and now
folks have changed my name from 'unfair' to 'lucky'." The man
agement plans to keep the dummy up for about a week.
