# ATHLETE OF THE WEEK
## Goiter Dailey Shoots a 66 To Pace Pair of Victories 
### 
Warren Dailey, number one Stanford golfer, gets the Daily's
Athlete of the Week award.
Dailey fired a brilliant 66 Saturday over the difficult Stanford
course to pace his teammates to a 25V2-IV2 slaughter of UCLA.
Dailey fired a pair of 33's in compiling his five under par round.

Then Monday, he sagged to a 39
front nine, but roared back with a
near record 31 back nine to lead
the Cards to an identical trouncing
of San Diego Navy.
The 18-year-old sophomore has
gone undefeated in eight matches
played so far this year. Last year,
he went to the quarter finals of the
National Intercollegiates. His coach,
Bud Finger, thinks that "Warren
should really be something to watch
by the time he is 25."
Dailey is a Sigma Chi. He is also
a character—"a poor man's Jimmy
Demaret" was how one team member
summed him up.
He is liable to bring his golf
clubs to class, to show up on the
course wearing red and white
striped pants, or to lecture classes
on the intricacies of uphill putting.
His game adds to his color. He is
one of the longest hitters in golf to
day, and a very good putter. His

v
problem is how to hit the green from
the fairway, and his real fear "is
traps."
escaping from down - hill lies in
When he can keep his game to
gether, he is a sensational player.
Last summer he fired a 64-67 to win
the Southern Michigan Amateur. He
also did well in the Ail-American
Amateur j tournament in Chicago.
His home town is Mantitowoc , Wis
consin.
Coach Finger is hoping Dailey and
his other soph star Fred Brown can
lead the Cards to a national cham
pionship. If not this year, then in
1954 and 1955. In the more immedi
ate future, Finger hopes that Dailey
can lead the Cards to a revenge win
against San Jose State when the two
teams meet again May 2. Highlight
of this match will find Dailey facing
one of America's great amateurs,
Ken Venturi. —D.K. & M.H.
