# Simon Out For Record
## 
### 
Track enthusiasts *this weekend
will get to see Bob Simon, lanky
Stanford distance ace, go in the 2-
mile against Occidental to try and
break his own 2-mile record of 9:19
set two seasons ago.
Simon has been specializing in
the mile and 880 so far this season,
but ran a 9:24 eight kipper in
practice way back in February.
This will probably be his last
chance to l>fcak the record, as his
services will be needed in both
half and mile against California
and in the Finals.
Included in the crowd of enthusi
asts will probably be Governor War
ren. The Governor will be in Palo
Alto Saturday to dedicate the new
city hall.


SOPHOMORE SENSATION—PhiI Presber is the top Occidental
sprinter and is hailed down south as a "really rapid guy." Al
though bothered by muscle injuries the Tiger dashman will
carry the Oxy laurels in the 100 and 220 Saturday against the
Indians in the Stadium at 1:30.
