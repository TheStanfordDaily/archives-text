### 
Stanford hurler Bob Murphy leads
the pitching department in CIBA
play this week with a three won,
none lost record.
Indian batters suffered a sharp
drop in the contests against Santa
Clara. First saeker Hal Hennacy is
the only player on Everett Dean's
nine to keep over the .300 mark. He
is followed by Jack Shepard, who
failed to get a hit in nine trips to the
plate against the Broncos.
Shepard is hitting .292. Warren
Goodrich is slugging .281 and Chuck
Essegian .280.
After setting a new league record
of four stolen bases in a game, short
stop Warren Goodrich leads the cir
cuit with six successful thefts.
