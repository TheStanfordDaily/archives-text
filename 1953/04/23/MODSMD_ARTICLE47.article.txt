# Women's Rest Home—Sleep and Relaxation
## 
### PAT KING 
Two pillows on every bed
and a box of kleenex on every
table. Music and flowers, but no
visitors. And lots of sleep.
This is the formula which for 28
years has rejuvenated wilted Stan
ford coeds. It has fought flu and
conquered colds. It is part of the
basic philosophy of the Women's
Rest Home.
For the past 15 years the brown
shingled house on Lower Row across
from the AKL house has been an
island of rest and quiet in a sea of
intellectual, athletic, and social ac
tivity. The original rest home, es
tablished around 1925, had room
for only three girls. The present
one accommodates 10 patients in
cither single or double rooms.
Guiding spirit behind the pres
ent establishment is genial Mrs.

Murray. She hands out medicine
and magazines, carries (rays and
flowers to the girls upstairs, takes
telephone messages from well
wishcrs, changes beds, and per
forms countless little tasks to
make students "visits" more en
joyable.
At her disposal Mrs. Murray has
everything from empirin compound
to an "elephant," a son of hot plate
which sends clouds of tinctuxe of
benzene up through a large metal
tube by the side of the bed. This
"steam treatment" does wonders for
relieving clogged heads and loosen
ing stubborn coughs.
A pleasant surprise to many is a
glass of hot lemonade or a dish of
ice cream, served just before bed
time.
Most patients are victims of flu
or had colds, and usually stay
about two and a half days. No

girls are admitted unless sent by
the Health Service or a doctor.
The "no visitors" rule is the only
rule in the Rest Home, and eyen
that is broken occasionally for spon
sors and RA's. Patients are free to
read, listen to their radio, study,
knit, write letters, or just' plain
doze. They may even use the tele
phone.
Mrs. Murray has a took and a
cleaning woman to help her with
her chores. But her day is a long
' one. She wakpns her charges a
little before seven with a cheery
"goofl morning" and a thermome
ter. At night she waits until ev
eryone is asleep or nearly so, usu
ally around 10, before she retires.
Departing girls are usually glad
to be getting back into circulation,
but sorry to be leaving such restful
surroundings. As one student re
cently released from the Rest Home
said, "It's* too bad you have to be
sick in order to get in."

RESTING COMFORTABLY—Margaret Dalgliesh, Ventura soph
omore, is one of tlie current "visitors" in the Women's Rest
Home. Under the direction of Mrs. Murray, the Rest Home pro
vides comfort, quiet, and medical care for girls suffering from
colds, flu, and minor illnesses. —Daily photo by Vern Dunn
Two pillows on every bed
and a box of kleenex on every
table. Music and flowers, but no
visitors. And lots of sleep.
This is the formula which for 28
years has rejuvenated wilted Stan
ford coeds. It has fought flu and
conquered colds. It is part of the
basic philosophy of the Women's
Rest Home.
For the past 15 years the brown
shingled house on Lower Row across
from the AKL house has been an
island of rest and quiet in a sea of
intellectual, athletic, and social ac
tivity. The original rest home, es
tablished around 1925, had room
for only three girls. The present
one accommodates 10 patients in
cither single or double rooms.
Guiding spirit behind the pres
ent establishment is genial Mrs.

Murray. She hands out medicine
and magazines, carries (rays and
flowers to the girls upstairs, takes
telephone messages from well
wishcrs, changes beds, and per
forms countless little tasks to
make students "visits" more en
joyable.
At her disposal Mrs. Murray has
everything from empirin compound
to an "elephant," a son of hot plate
which sends clouds of tinctuxe of
benzene up through a large metal
tube by the side of the bed. This
"steam treatment" does wonders for
relieving clogged heads and loosen
ing stubborn coughs.
A pleasant surprise to many is a
glass of hot lemonade or a dish of
ice cream, served just before bed
time.
Most patients are victims of flu
or had colds, and usually stay
about two and a half days. No

girls are admitted unless sent by
the Health Service or a doctor.
The "no visitors" rule is the only
rule in the Rest Home, and eyen
that is broken occasionally for spon
sors and RA's. Patients are free to
read, listen to their radio, study,
knit, write letters, or just' plain
doze. They may even use the tele
phone.
Mrs. Murray has a took and a
cleaning woman to help her with
her chores. But her day is a long
' one. She wakpns her charges a
little before seven with a cheery
"goofl morning" and a thermome
ter. At night she waits until ev
eryone is asleep or nearly so, usu
ally around 10, before she retires.
Departing girls are usually glad
to be getting back into circulation,
but sorry to be leaving such restful
surroundings. As one student re
cently released from the Rest Home
said, "It's* too bad you have to be
sick in order to get in."
