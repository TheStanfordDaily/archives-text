## The 						Election Mess 
### 
According to evidence gathered by Daily reporters late in the
afternoon, yesterday's ASSU election voting procedure was foully
messed up.
The snafu concerned in particular seniors voting /or three
classes of officers: graduate nnd living group representatives
to Exccm, and Men's and Women's Council officers.
Some seniors were allowed to vote for one of these officers,
some for none, and some for nil.
The regulation war; set down vaguely in a mimeographed
pamphlet entitled "ASSU Voting Booth Instructions." Inconsist
ent application of the voters' eligibility reguirements resulted in
random distribution of ballots.
Excom ruled last night the election invalid as far as some of
these offices are concerned.
Rightly so, because it is im/>ossihle to tell what seniors voted
for what offices, and how lost votes would have affected the
results.
There has also been* conflicting opinion as to whether or not
seniors should vote for these offices. *
We say:
1. Seniors should be qualified to vote for these offices, feince the
principle has been laid down clearly in determining the eligi
bility of other classes of voters.
.A person votes for the offices that his residence and class
standing qualify him to at the time of the election; that is, a dorm
resident votes for a dorm representative, regardless of whether
he may or may not be a dorm resident the following year.
2. In order to avoid future conflict and confusion, the elig'h
bility of voters should be defined and written into the ASSU by
laws. Such is not the case at present.
