# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
They can say what they want about Cecil B. De-
Miile producing the greatest show on earth, hut it
ain't true. Excom presented the greatest show on
earth on Wednesday night in three-dimensional, and
1 haven't been so confused since I took my Western
Civ final three years ago.
I've been having trouble finding straight men

lately, bill I finally found them
in the Hi embattled members of
Excom who see to if every
Wednesday night thai the
Winds of Freedom keep blow
ing around here.
Excom had just finished weary
ing itself in a lengthy NSA de
bate when Thornton Garrett,
head of election board came in
and lead the election results.
"No, no, I protest there-

suit* iii men's and women's councils anil grad rep
resentative," shouted one member and put the
protest into a form of a motion.
"Why, why?" cried a voice from the background.
"Because some seniors weren't allowed to vote for
grad representative and for men's and women's coun
cil."
Gad, here was real, stark drama. People had been
dis-enfranchised. The Wind: ot Freedom had been
snuffed out. Poly Sci profs would hear about tiiis!
The Supreme Court would ht ur about this! Everyone
would hear about this! What to do.
The members of Ex com and other assorted well
wishers that were in the room started fhtinihhiK
through their constitutions and rattling mimeo
graphed papers.
Someone suggested that all living group elections
be protested too, because some seniors had been de
nied voting there.
"No, no," shouted Jim Madison, chief rooster of the

Daily. "Not enough seniors were deprived of their
votes to make a difference there."
"That's fallacious," boomed Jack Eraser, a blonde
crusader for the Sigma Chi house. "It's the princi
pal that counts, not the difference in the votes."
"Wait, wait." sandwiched in Dick Weismann, the
people's cherce, and one of the few who was keeping
calm.
Kut no one waited. Instead, Fran Kirk, whose con
stituency is the Village, said, "I protest the Village
election. Why hasn't John Brooke's name been
read?"
"Because he was a write-in and only got two votes,"
answered someone on Election Board.
"That can't be," shouted Kirk. "I personally
marched 40 people from my wing to the polls!"
Honors, the 40 people, where were they? The meet
ing broke up while everyone looked under chairs
and tables for the 40 missing voters.
"My mistake, my mistake," broke in Garrett.
"I just found 54 votes for Brooke."
"I call off (lie protest," snapped Kirk.
Jean Leonard from Union offered, "Another election.
Another election."
"No, no," shouted Bob Mishell, a self-appointed
guardian of the people from Toy on. "Not another
election. I'm a candidate, and I'm tired of eandi
dating. In another election, interest would drop
off and people would voluntarily dis-enfranehise
themselves."
"No. no," cried someone else. "Voluntarily dis
enfranchising themselves. Never! That couldn't hap
pen!"
Apparehtly this was something worse than the
seven-year itch, Cellar coffee, and Senator McCarthy,
all rolled into one.
And so, ori and on it went. At any rate. I finally
found myself some straight men.

protest into a form of a motion.
"Why, why?" cried a voice from the background.
"Because some seniors weren't allowed to vote for
grad representative and for men's and women's coun
cil."
Gad, here was real, stark drama. People had been
dis-enfranchised. The Wind: ot Freedom had been
snuffed out. Poly Sci profs would hear about tiiis!
The Supreme Court would ht ur about this! Everyone
would hear about this! What to do.
The members of Ex com and other assorted well
wishers that were in the room started fhtinihhiK
through their constitutions and rattling mimeo
graphed papers.
Someone suggested that all living group elections
be protested too, because some seniors had been de
nied voting there.
"No, no," shouted Jim Madison, chief rooster of the

Daily. "Not enough seniors were deprived of their
votes to make a difference there."
"That's fallacious," boomed Jack Eraser, a blonde
crusader for the Sigma Chi house. "It's the princi
pal that counts, not the difference in the votes."
"Wait, wait." sandwiched in Dick Weismann, the
people's cherce, and one of the few who was keeping
calm.
Kut no one waited. Instead, Fran Kirk, whose con
stituency is the Village, said, "I protest the Village
election. Why hasn't John Brooke's name been
read?"
"Because he was a write-in and only got two votes,"
answered someone on Election Board.
"That can't be," shouted Kirk. "I personally
marched 40 people from my wing to the polls!"
Honors, the 40 people, where were they? The meet
ing broke up while everyone looked under chairs
and tables for the 40 missing voters.
"My mistake, my mistake," broke in Garrett.
"I just found 54 votes for Brooke."
"I call off (lie protest," snapped Kirk.
Jean Leonard from Union offered, "Another election.
Another election."
"No, no," shouted Bob Mishell, a self-appointed
guardian of the people from Toy on. "Not another
election. I'm a candidate, and I'm tired of eandi
dating. In another election, interest would drop
off and people would voluntarily dis-enfranehise
themselves."
"No. no," cried someone else. "Voluntarily dis
enfranchising themselves. Never! That couldn't hap
pen!"
Apparehtly this was something worse than the
seven-year itch, Cellar coffee, and Senator McCarthy,
all rolled into one.
And so, ori and on it went. At any rate. I finally
found myself some straight men.

They can say what they want about Cecil B. De-
Miile producing the greatest show on earth, hut it
ain't true. Excom presented the greatest show on
earth on Wednesday night in three-dimensional, and
1 haven't been so confused since I took my Western
