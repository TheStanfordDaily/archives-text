# CAMPUS OPINION
## On Academic Freedom 
### 
of Decree"
(Ed. note: The long-term question of academic
freedom aAd responsibility, together with its short
term implications in congressional investigations,
is presently being studied locally by a faculty
committee. The problem is also worthy of dis
cussion and thought bv students. We print the
following leters in the hopes they will stimulate
further letters. The Daily also plans t«» discuss
the question editorially.)
To the Editor:
The intrusion of the current Communist scare into
education, with witch-hunters, anti-witch-hunters,
Comunists, and innocent suspects chasing one another
around and around like Little Black Sambo's tigers,
is not a very admirable spectacle. The greater part
of the uproar seems to spring from the fact that Com
munist.'. are thought of as a species apart, a group
that lias.seceded from the human race. Thus we may
find the same educator who refuses to consider per
mitting Communists on the faculty also arguing ve
hemently against investigations which turn the slight
est unfavorable publicity on non-Communists.
"Communism 1 ' seems to be so black a label that
nothing is too bad for anyone proved to be a Com
munist, but to acuse anyone of Communism falsely
is a diabolical slander. Such an insistence on see
ing the matter in clear black and white is no credit
to the logical processes of those who hold these
views, especially those who rank as educational
leaders.
It is quite possibly true that those who adhere to
the Party line cannot also be independent scholars.
But this is a matter of degree. Has there ever been
a prdfessor who was a pure intellectual machine,
completely devoid of prejudices and uninfluenced
by the pressures of his colleagues or the possible ap
plications of his subject matter? We cannot exclude
such factors from scholarship; we can only balance
one bias against another.
Comunism is so important in the world today
that students are entitled to hear it advocated by
those who believe in it, not merely mentioned and
refuted by its opponents. Similarly, while research
performed by Communists may possibly be t<*»
biased to have real value, it would be a sad way
of promoting free investigation to exclude before
hand all research conducted with any given bias.
However, if we are to permit those with whom we
disagree to speak from our lecture platforms, it is
essential that we have some protection against their
excesses. For students to assume that the Commu
nistic views of a given professor were the orthodox
views of the college would be even worse than for
them never to hear these views. Hence it is de
sirable that Communists, though not being excluded
from college teaching, sholud have their political
affiliations known by their students, so that their
statements may be viewed in context. Thus those in
vestigating committees which concern themselves
with these matters can perform a public service.
A Congressional committee has no power to dis
cipline anyone for his political position; it is public
opinion which does that. 11 a college administrator
fires a faculty member because a Congressional in
vestigation has suggested that he may be a Com
munist, does the fault lie with the investigator who
was seeking information or with the educator who
acted on insufficient evidence so as to stitlle academic
freedom and deprive a professoi ol his livelihood?

It will be observed that I have named no names and
have kept this discussion at a semi-hypothetical
level Whom the shoe fits, let him put it on.

To the Editor:
It certainly is time for us to start examining and
evaluating the issues in ''the problem of Congressional
investigations and our professors," whether or not
this leads to our "taking a stand" individually or
collectively. Presenting our varying opinions in this
column seems like a good way to start.
"First, if any opinion is compelled to silence, (hat
opinion may. lot- aught we can certainly know, be
true. To deny this is to assume our own infallibility.
"Secondly, though the silenced opinion be an
error, it may, and very commonly does, contain a
portion of truth; and since the general or pre
vailing opinion on any subject is rarely or never
the whole truth, it is only hy the collision of ad
verse opinions that the .remainder of the truth has
any chance of being supplied . .
John Stuart IVIill, 1859
We believe that the free dimension of "controversial"
ideas (arid any idea could be considered contro
versial, since the word is currently defined as it
suits the most articulate group) is indispensable to
the sort of education a university should be trying
to give us. We also believe with Mill that, no matter
how "true" the prevailing .political and economic
theories may be, "unless (they are 1 ) . . . contested"
and weighed against other theories by each indi
vidual, whoever "believes in" such a theory will
necessarily believe it "in the manner of a prejudice,
with little comprehension ... of its rational grounds
. . . the meaning of the doctrine itself will be in
danger of being lost, enfeebled, and deprived of its
vital effect on the character and conduct."
Some people, McCarthy among them, would say
that this philosophy is a good thing in general, but
a dangerous one when our liberal democracy seems
to be threatened by a conflicting ideology. But an
important and basic part of this liberal democracy
that the investigators say they want to protect is
respect for the "controversial" ideas of the minority.
Either the investigators do not include this in their
definition ol American democracy or they are de
liberately trying to destroy what they say they are
trying to protect. In either case, the most enthusi
asic thing we can say about them is that they are not
fit judges of who should teach what in any university.
Respecting the r ight of the minority to agree with
Marx's economic doctrines, for instance, need not be
the same thing as respecting the right of the minority
to overthrow our government by force. The Smith
Act makes this distinction, and the FBI presumably
enforces the Smith Act as well as it can without
violating the Bill of Rights. We favor leaving criminal
investigation in the hands of the FBI, which, al
though not so hot for publicity as McCarthy, seems
better qualified to investigate criminals. We favor
leaving criminal trials in the hands of our courts,
which, although not so well publicized as McCarthy
esque committees, seem better qualified to try crimi
nals.

To the Editor:
The intrusion of the current Communist scare into
education, with witch-hunters, anti-witch-hunters,
Comunists, and innocent suspects chasing one another
around and around like Little Black Sambo's tigers,
is not a very admirable spectacle. The greater part
of the uproar seems to spring from the fact that Com
munist.'. are thought of as a species apart, a group
that lias.seceded from the human race. Thus we may
find the same educator who refuses to consider per
mitting Communists on the faculty also arguing ve
hemently against investigations which turn the slight
est unfavorable publicity on non-Communists.
"Communism 1 ' seems to be so black a label that
nothing is too bad for anyone proved to be a Com
munist, but to acuse anyone of Communism falsely
is a diabolical slander. Such an insistence on see
ing the matter in clear black and white is no credit
to the logical processes of those who hold these
views, especially those who rank as educational
leaders.
It is quite possibly true that those who adhere to
the Party line cannot also be independent scholars.
But this is a matter of degree. Has there ever been
a prdfessor who was a pure intellectual machine,
completely devoid of prejudices and uninfluenced
by the pressures of his colleagues or the possible ap
plications of his subject matter? We cannot exclude
such factors from scholarship; we can only balance
one bias against another.
Comunism is so important in the world today
that students are entitled to hear it advocated by
those who believe in it, not merely mentioned and
refuted by its opponents. Similarly, while research
performed by Communists may possibly be t<*»
biased to have real value, it would be a sad way
of promoting free investigation to exclude before
hand all research conducted with any given bias.
However, if we are to permit those with whom we
disagree to speak from our lecture platforms, it is
essential that we have some protection against their
excesses. For students to assume that the Commu
nistic views of a given professor were the orthodox
views of the college would be even worse than for
them never to hear these views. Hence it is de
sirable that Communists, though not being excluded
from college teaching, sholud have their political
affiliations known by their students, so that their
statements may be viewed in context. Thus those in
vestigating committees which concern themselves
with these matters can perform a public service.
A Congressional committee has no power to dis
cipline anyone for his political position; it is public
opinion which does that. 11 a college administrator
fires a faculty member because a Congressional in
vestigation has suggested that he may be a Com
munist, does the fault lie with the investigator who
was seeking information or with the educator who
acted on insufficient evidence so as to stitlle academic
freedom and deprive a professoi ol his livelihood?

It certainly is time for us to start examining and

investigations and our professors," whether or not
this leads to our "taking a stand" individually or

column seems like a good way to start.
"First, if any opinion is compelled to silence, (hat
opinion may. lot- aught we can certainly know, be

"Secondly, though the silenced opinion be an
error, it may, and very commonly does, contain a
portion of truth; and since the general or pre
vailing opinion on any subject is rarely or never
the whole truth, it is only hy the collision of ad

any chance of being supplied . .

We believe that the free dimension of "controversial"
ideas (arid any idea could be considered contro
versial, since the word is currently defined as it
suits the most articulate group) is indispensable to
the sort of education a university should be trying
to give us. We also believe with Mill that, no matter
how "true" the prevailing .political and economic
theories may be, "unless (they are 1 ) . . . contested"
and weighed against other theories by each indi
vidual, whoever "believes in" such a theory will
necessarily believe it "in the manner of a prejudice,
with little comprehension ... of its rational grounds
. . . the meaning of the doctrine itself will be in
danger of being lost, enfeebled, and deprived of its
vital effect on the character and conduct."
Some people, McCarthy among them, would say
that this philosophy is a good thing in general, but
a dangerous one when our liberal democracy seems
to be threatened by a conflicting ideology. But an
important and basic part of this liberal democracy
that the investigators say they want to protect is
respect for the "controversial" ideas of the minority.
Either the investigators do not include this in their
definition ol American democracy or they are de
liberately trying to destroy what they say they are
trying to protect. In either case, the most enthusi
asic thing we can say about them is that they are not
fit judges of who should teach what in any university.
Respecting the r ight of the minority to agree with
Marx's economic doctrines, for instance, need not be
the same thing as respecting the right of the minority
to overthrow our government by force. The Smith
Act makes this distinction, and the FBI presumably
enforces the Smith Act as well as it can without
violating the Bill of Rights. We favor leaving criminal
investigation in the hands of the FBI, which, al
though not so hot for publicity as McCarthy, seems
better qualified to investigate criminals. We favor
leaving criminal trials in the hands of our courts,
which, although not so well publicized as McCarthy

It certainly is time for us to start examining and
evaluating the issues in ''the problem of Congressional
investigations and our professors," whether or not
this leads to our "taking a stand" individually or
collectively. Presenting our varying opinions in this
column seems like a good way to start.
"First, if any opinion is compelled to silence, (hat
opinion may. lot- aught we can certainly know, be
true. To deny this is to assume our own infallibility.
"Secondly, though the silenced opinion be an
error, it may, and very commonly does, contain a
portion of truth; and since the general or pre
vailing opinion on any subject is rarely or never
the whole truth, it is only hy the collision of ad
verse opinions that the .remainder of the truth has
any chance of being supplied . .
John Stuart IVIill, 1859
We believe that the free dimension of "controversial"
ideas (arid any idea could be considered contro
versial, since the word is currently defined as it
suits the most articulate group) is indispensable to
the sort of education a university should be trying
to give us. We also believe with Mill that, no matter
how "true" the prevailing .political and economic
theories may be, "unless (they are 1 ) . . . contested"
and weighed against other theories by each indi
vidual, whoever "believes in" such a theory will
necessarily believe it "in the manner of a prejudice,
with little comprehension ... of its rational grounds
. . . the meaning of the doctrine itself will be in
danger of being lost, enfeebled, and deprived of its
vital effect on the character and conduct."
Some people, McCarthy among them, would say
that this philosophy is a good thing in general, but
a dangerous one when our liberal democracy seems
to be threatened by a conflicting ideology. But an
important and basic part of this liberal democracy
that the investigators say they want to protect is
respect for the "controversial" ideas of the minority.
Either the investigators do not include this in their
definition ol American democracy or they are de
liberately trying to destroy what they say they are
trying to protect. In either case, the most enthusi
asic thing we can say about them is that they are not
fit judges of who should teach what in any university.
Respecting the r ight of the minority to agree with
Marx's economic doctrines, for instance, need not be
the same thing as respecting the right of the minority
to overthrow our government by force. The Smith
Act makes this distinction, and the FBI presumably
enforces the Smith Act as well as it can without
violating the Bill of Rights. We favor leaving criminal
investigation in the hands of the FBI, which, al
though not so hot for publicity as McCarthy, seems
better qualified to investigate criminals. We favor
leaving criminal trials in the hands of our courts,
