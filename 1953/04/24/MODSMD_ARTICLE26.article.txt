# On Civ Libe Book Thefts
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Earlier this quarter a letter to (he Daily slated
that books had been taken from the Western Civ
library before they were checked in. As a result
persons had to pay for books they had returned. The
letter noted that this was a violation of the Funda
mental Standard and that violations of this nature
can and should be prevented.
This committee investigated the particular situation
and discussed possible methods of stopping library
book thefts in general. The investigation revealed:
(1) Volume of book thefts is not considered unusu
ally great by the assistant director o! the library: (2)
The return chute at the Western Civ library has been
lengthened to prevent theft of books returned but
not checked in; (3) Measures have been taken to pre
vent entry into the Western Civ library at other
lluiu icgulai hours.

The possibility of taking police measures to pre
vent book thefts was considered and rejected because
it would imply that a system of personal honor cannot
work at Stanford. It would defeat one of the most
significant aspects of our University life, one in
which we take justifiable pride.
The libe situation brings to light a truth we should
consider the system of personal honor stated in the
Fundamental Standard applies not only to a few de
fined areas of activity, but to "all our actions in
and out of school. Whatever we do, Stanford is af
fected for better or worse as well as ourselves. Our
University's society is only as good as we make it
It is therefore a duty to" ourselves and our fellow
students to make this society a good one by practicing
personal integrity in ;i 11 phases of activity.
