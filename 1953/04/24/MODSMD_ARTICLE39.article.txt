## Freshmen Host Pair 
### 
Coach Ray Dean's frosh track
sters should have little trouble get- '
ting back into the win column to
morrow morning when they meet j
Menlo and Hartnell Junior Colleges
at 10 in a triangular meet at Angell
Field.
Neither of the two JC squads is '
expected to offer much competition. *
Menlo has a few outstanding per
formers, but is sorely lacking in 1
depth.
Stockton College was slated to
take part to make it a quadrangular j
affair, but the Mustangs bowed out j
during the week.
Dean announced only two
changes for the meet. JRalph Love
will only run the mile event, while
"iron man" Jim Truher will con- '
cent rate his efforts on the sprints.
Love will be out to tour the mile j
in less than 4:24.4, histseason's best, j
He will not run the two-mile, leav- j
ing Bob Maddock as the Cards' only
entry in the event. Maddock fin- |
ished fifth last weekend.
Truher will leave the field events |
in the hope of bettering his marks
in the 100 and the 220.
High jumper John Stewart, who
has been improving his own record
each week, will seek to eclipse his j
present mark of G feet 6 :1 1 inches.
