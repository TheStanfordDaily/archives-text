# Oxy Tracksters Invade Stanford Oval Tomorrow
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
An amazingly impotent Pay ton
Jordan Occidental track team will
! face a rather battered Jack Weiers-
I hauser Stanford track team in the
| Stanford Stadium tomorrow, and it
j still looks like the Indians all the
| way.
The Cards, though missing Maury
| Parson (pulled muscle) in the
I sprints and with Bob Mathias in
the hurdles and Dave Fletcher in
i the 880 only probable starters, still
j should have enough depth to romp
j home the winners by over 30 points.
Occidental's big chance to pull an
i upset (and it would be an upset of
| proportions unheard - of in this
neighborhood) will come in the first 1
race. Bob Reed, the two-mile spe
cialist, who ran a 4:18.6 as a fresh
man last year and hasn't given it
his all yet this year, will face
Claude Fiddler (4:21.5), Jim Ter
rill (4:22.3), and Paul Southgate
| (4:22.6). We doped Reed in for a
' second. He could take first, he could
I come in out of the money.
Walt Garrett probably won't go
in the quarter and Fred George
| and Jon Spear will have a real
; fight for fi'rst.
In the sprints, the Keith Browns
berger half of the Parsons-Browns
berger sprint combo will try to do
it alone. He should be a shoo-in in

the century but might have a bind
in the furlong against Bravton Nor- ;
ton and Chuck Gerry.
Another variable comes in the ;
two-mile. Simon will be out for !
his own two - mile record, and j
should win easily. If Fidler runs |
the mile and two-mile, Reed could
take him in the eight-lapper. If he
suves himself for the longer race, he j
should take Reed.
In the hurdles, Marty Johnson '
and Gerry Wood should take firsts j
in the lows and highs respectively. !
If Mathias runs, move them down j
one and give us a pair of one-two's.
In the field events Stanford
should really roll. We dope them
for three sweeps and possibly four.
Chuck Harlow and Brayton Nor- I
ton will fight it out for the third j
spot. The records say Norton is ;
seven inches better and that's the ;
way we call it, but don't give odds, j
Our broad jumping team of Pete |
McKay, l.oren Sorensen, and Jim |
Seebold are all over a foot better i
i than anything (he Tigers have, s
but they all have minor injuries
of one sort or another.
For those interested, this will be j
the next to the last time that a cer
tain athlete named Bob Mathias
participates on the Stanford Sta
dium turf in the school colors. Bob !
is by far the world's greatest track ;
man—yet how many Stanford stu
detns have' seen the affable fellow I
actually run the hurdles and flip j
the discus and shot. He's not good, :
he's great—the greatest.
You only have two more times to j
see him and his great leather- j
lunged teammate, Bob Simon, give
their all for the Cardinal don't
miss this opportunity.
Field events start at 1:30 p'.m., the
first track event at 2 —see you there, j
