# ASSU GERMAN SCHOLAR
## Modern Marco Polo Mixes Business With Pleasure

"Money? Yes. I like money,"
laughs Ewald (Ed) Hagen, ASSU
Foreign Scholar from Germany.
; "When I was not traveling for
fun, I was traveling for business
and sold whatever promised to
leave a good margin."
At Stanford, Ed is currently liv
ing at the Alpha Sig house, will re
ceive his M.B.A. in June. In Ger
many, he is one-half year short of
obtaining his doctorate in econom
ics. President of the Stanford
Sports Car Club, Ed is salesman of
foreign - made automobiles for a
Palo Alto company and, in his
"spare time," teaches German pro
nunciation and enunciation in the
studio of music teacher Robert Ev
erhart. Ed recently won a merit
award for the best sales in a fort
night for an Ail-American hosiery
sales contest.
"Employment with American and
British military governments in
Germany helped improve my Eng
lish," Ed says. "Later, at the Joint
Export - Import Agency, I became
my own employer.
''One of I)r. Strong's tenets, not
to underestimate yourself, bad
sneaked into my head already
then. I wanted to be on my own.
I sold dclikatesscn in northern
Germany, with six local sales
men in my territory. This job is
very respectable and paid well.
Then I went in for bubble gum
| and assorted gimmicks, buying
i and selling on my own. This was
not at ;dI respectable l»ut excecd
| ingly remunerative."

Withdrawing from local "get rich
quick" woVk, Ed entered foreign
trade, exporting German cars, mo
torcycles, office supplies, typewrit
ers, and musical instruments to
Haiti in exchange for Dominican
tobacco. This enabled him to use
foreign languages and involved a
lot of traveling. Profits were high-

ly satisfactory, too. "In Germany,"
according to Ed, "my working days
had 15 to 17 hours, so I had some
time to teach German to Americans.
At times I had 20 students in the
classes."
Ed feels that his stay in the U.S.
will help him in his future business
in foreign trade. He would also like
either to do some teaching on the
side or retire early and teach full
time on the university level. He
says his best professors in Germany
were "those who either were in
business or had rich practical expe
rience."
A basic difference between
America and Germany, according
to Ed, rests on the economic sys
tems. In Germany there is not

as extensive a time-payment sys
tem. "We Germans work first—
then buy. There is no need for
'keeping up with the Jones.' But
the modern American seems to
wear last year's suit while buy
ing this year's automobile with
next year's pay—sort of a cham
pagne taste on a beer salary."
Recalling his speaking engage
ment before junior high school chil
dren during United Nations Day in
Richmond, Ed remarked, "German
children of the same age would not
have been able to ask such intelli
gent questions or to act as inde
pendent, aggressive, grown-up, and
free as do the Americans."
.Ed attends meetings of the Com
monwealth Club, an organization of
business and professional men in
San Francisco. "At first, I sensed a
rather negative, or at least negli
gent, attitude of the Americans to
ward Germans and Germany, How
ever, during a recent meeting of
the club, 112 noticed that Germany's
Chancellor Adenauer received a
very warm welcome. It warmed my
heart as well as his, I am sure."

Ed feels that his stay in the U.S.
will help him in his future business
in foreign trade. He would also like
either to do some teaching on the
side or retire early and teach full
time on the university level. He
says his best professors in Germany
were "those who either were in
business or had rich practical expe
rience."
A basic difference between
America and Germany, according
to Ed, rests on the economic sys
tems. In Germany there is not

as extensive a time-payment sys
tem. "We Germans work first—
then buy. There is no need for
'keeping up with the Jones.' But
the modern American seems to
wear last year's suit while buy
ing this year's automobile with
next year's pay—sort of a cham
pagne taste on a beer salary."
Recalling his speaking engage
ment before junior high school chil
dren during United Nations Day in
Richmond, Ed remarked, "German
children of the same age would not
have been able to ask such intelli
gent questions or to act as inde
pendent, aggressive, grown-up, and
free as do the Americans."
.Ed attends meetings of the Com
monwealth Club, an organization of
business and professional men in
San Francisco. "At first, I sensed a
rather negative, or at least negli
gent, attitude of the Americans to
ward Germans and Germany, How
ever, during a recent meeting of
the club, 112 noticed that Germany's
Chancellor Adenauer received a
very warm welcome. It warmed my
heart as well as his, I am sure."


ED HAGEN
—Foreign Scholar from Germany
"Money? Yes. I like money,"
laughs Ewald (Ed) Hagen, ASSU
Foreign Scholar from Germany.
; "When I was not traveling for
fun, I was traveling for business
and sold whatever promised to
leave a good margin."
At Stanford, Ed is currently liv
ing at the Alpha Sig house, will re
ceive his M.B.A. in June. In Ger
many, he is one-half year short of
obtaining his doctorate in econom
ics. President of the Stanford
Sports Car Club, Ed is salesman of
foreign - made automobiles for a
Palo Alto company and, in his
"spare time," teaches German pro
nunciation and enunciation in the
studio of music teacher Robert Ev
erhart. Ed recently won a merit
award for the best sales in a fort
night for an Ail-American hosiery
sales contest.
"Employment with American and
British military governments in
Germany helped improve my Eng
lish," Ed says. "Later, at the Joint
Export - Import Agency, I became
my own employer.
''One of I)r. Strong's tenets, not
to underestimate yourself, bad
sneaked into my head already
then. I wanted to be on my own.
I sold dclikatesscn in northern
Germany, with six local sales
men in my territory. This job is
very respectable and paid well.
Then I went in for bubble gum
| and assorted gimmicks, buying
i and selling on my own. This was
not at ;dI respectable l»ut excecd
| ingly remunerative."

Withdrawing from local "get rich
quick" woVk, Ed entered foreign
trade, exporting German cars, mo
torcycles, office supplies, typewrit
ers, and musical instruments to
Haiti in exchange for Dominican
tobacco. This enabled him to use
foreign languages and involved a
lot of traveling. Profits were high-

ly satisfactory, too. "In Germany,"
according to Ed, "my working days
had 15 to 17 hours, so I had some
time to teach German to Americans.
At times I had 20 students in the
classes."
