### BOB REZAK 
(Editor's nolo: The following
story was compiled from reports
of students and of Daily report
ers.)

While victorious candidates
basked in post • election glory
yesterday, voters made now re
ports on the confusion that sur
rounded Wednesday's ASSU
primary elections.
From Encina, the How, the Vil
lage, and other campus points, the
same question was raised: What
caused the confusion and general
snafu in the primaries—and is there
the possibility of a similar occur
rence in next Wednesday's final
elect ions?
For the most part there were no
easy answers. Bui generally most,
agreed that somebody the Flec
tion Board, the polling - station

workers, <>i the voters themselves
had fallen down on the job of eon- j
ducting an organized and efficiently j
run election.
One student, a junior who lives ,
al the Village, said he was told he
could not vote for Village repre- j
sentatives to Lxeom because he
"thought" lie might live on the
campus next quarter. Instead, he
was given a ballot to vote for
campus living group represents- j
lives.
Another student, a .sophomore,
reported he was given a ballot to
vote for senior, class officers, be
cause the election staff worker at
the polls failed to make a careful
check of his student body card and
class identification.
A senior at Stern says he was
given a choice of ballots for either
graduate class representative to
Fxcom or living group represen
tative to Kxrom.

One senior was allowed to vote
for Men's Council members, but
was not allowed to vote for living

ner of the election for Village
