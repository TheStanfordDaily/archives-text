## Card Nine Puts CIBA Lead on Line 
### PETE GROTHE 
It's a crooocial weekend for
Everett Dean's baseballers.
Our nine hosts the Southern
Cal men of the diamond this af
ternoon at 3:15 and then tangles
with "Cinderella team" Califor
nia here tomorrow at 3:30.
The Dcanmcn will be making a
desperate altcmpl to remain aristo
cratic and stay in the CIBA pent
house while keeping the peons from
Bcarville out of it.
The Cards have a five ami two
record, while Berkeley is one-hall
Came behind with five and three.
The Bears lost their first three
CIBA tilts and then won their
next live in a row.
Cal's top huner, A1 Mathews, will
be saved to pitch against the Indian
top doc, Bob Murphy, on Saturday.
Mathews has a 3-1 record and Mur
phy a 3-0. This will be the first
meeting between the two teams
this year.
Third baseman Don Walker leads
the Cal stickers with a .407 average,
and outfielder Tom Kcough i.s right
behind w/th a .1185.
The Bear lineup will he com
posed of Walker, third base;
Kcough, left field; Dick Anient,
shortstop; Tom Pollock, right
field; Pete Krichman, first base;
Cas Munoz, center field; Jack
M a c K a .v, second base; Itay
Greene, catcher; and Mathews,
pitcher.
Today's melee will be the third
meeting between Southern Cal and
the Cards. The Trojans have a
three - won, four - lost mark, and
three of those losses have been at
the hands of the Cards.
Troy is a young and developing
team, and the Indians were fortu-

nate to meet them early in the .sea
son. USC is stronger now and is
very revenge-minded.
Warren Goodrich now leads the
league in stolen bases, thanks to a
league record he set last week by
pilfering four bases against Santa
C lara in one game. The Indians
stole more bases than they ot
base bits last weekend.
The Stanford lineup for the game
will he: Rich Scramaglia, second
base; Goodrich, shortstop: A 1 Tal
boy, right field; Jack Shepard,
catcher; Chuck Essegian, left field;
Ray Swarts, third base; Dick Cole,
