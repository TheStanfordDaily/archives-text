# Frosh Edit Daily Today
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily today is the
annual frosh edition. It has been
put out entirely under the super
vision of the freshman staff mem
bers, and, for the first time in many
years, in the Daily Shaek.
A.s usual there was much upper
class opposition to the production of
the paper, but this was almost com
pletely nullified when freshman
Managing Editor Dave Brownwood,
Nigh* Editor Tony Hodge, and Fea
ture Editor Tom Pcirce staged a
surprise raid on the Shack on Fri
day. The copy paper, typewriters,
and light bulbs which were con
fiscated proved sufficient for the
production of a Monday paper.
Included in the list of freshmen
who are aiming for high positions
on future Dailies are Dick Mans
field and Eda Mendcls, now already
wire editors; Dave Brownwood,
Chuck Chestnut, Tacy Smith, Jayne
Kravig, John McFee, Ellen Mann,
Tom Peircc, and Bill Wright, copy
readers; and Pete Bcrtino, Margaret
Hobson, Audrey Prendergast, and
Hart Spragcr, reporters.
