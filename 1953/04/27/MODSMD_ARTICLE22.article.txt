# What Fundamental Standard?
## 
### 
A fraternity has been ruled off the campus
for a violation of the Fundamental Standard.
You'll find the details in the lead story in to
day's Daily. The name of the fraternity and
even the fact that it was a fraternity are really
unimportant details. What is important is this:
The student body now has concrete proof
of what it hats actually known lor a long time:
The liquor clause of the Fundamental Stand
aid is not taken seriously at Stanford.
It might have been in any living group of
any sort, or in an eating club, that liguor was
found. It is generally known but seldom ad
mitted that there is liguor in almost every or
ganization hall on the campus at one time or
another, and in the dormitories as well. This
in absolute violation of the Fundamental Stand
ard.
Usually, nothing is done. Now, Inter fra
ternity Council has moved, but only after a
complaint was registered by a student. An
example has been made of a fraternity. It
didn't have to be a fraternity.
This is the Frosh Edition of the Daily, and this

is a Freshman viewpoint. The Frosh come into
Stanford with a pretty clear picture of what the
Fundamental Standard is. We got letters and
booklets about the Fundamental Standard, and
we had to write a paper about it in Freshman
English. When we arrived on campus, we
found people who said, "So what? They won't
catch you if you pull down the shades and turn
down the lights . . And now it is in the
news: Someone has been caught in the act.
As usual, that which sounds like a mass scan
dal is actually the work of a small minority. In
tach living group there are a few, but very
few, people who will actually violate the liguor
clause of the Fundamental Standard. But at the
Sctme time there is a large group the majority
— which, though it knows of specific violations,
does nothing in the way of reporting or at
tempting to stop them.
These people are just as guilty of Funda
mental Standard violations as those who actu
ally uncork the bottles. Don't Stanford stu
dents want the Fundamental Standard to wojk?
The Freshmen wonder.
