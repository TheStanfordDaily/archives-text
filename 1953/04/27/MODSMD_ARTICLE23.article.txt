# CAMPUS OPINION
## Hilton's Lecture 
### 
To the Editor:
Our reference: Mr. Hilton's talk about his three
months trip to Spain given in the Memorial Audi
torium.
One misfortune after another. First we have the
Communist party; second the civil war; afterwards
the economic blockade of the U.N.O to force Spain
to be "free." And now Mr. Hilton doesn't even like us.
Mr. Hilton's talk began about medicine. At the
beginning it seemed t«> be a doctor defending his
interest against socialized medicine. Afterwards he
was a spy struggling at great personal risks for the
world's liberties, trying to grasp the real opinion
of the Spanish population whose freedom of ex
pression is very restricted by fear of the secret
police. However he later describes traveling on a
train in an apartment with seven persons all of
whom are speaking angrily against Franco. Con
clusion: Spanish secret police don't travel on trains.
He said: "Spanish political life is shrouded in a
nebulous cloud." That is what happens when you
try to explain something that you have not been able
to understand. You only see a "nebulous cloud."
Mr. Hilton does not like cathedrals. He thinks it
would be better that the Spanish government would
give the money to the poor instead ol building cathe

drals. Sorry, it is a little late; they were built before
Franco, centuries ago.
Mr. Hilton does not like Spain because it is Catho
lic; that is one clear fact in the middle of the "nebu
lous cloud."
He continues: "At present Communism is not an
organized force in Fresh news. Sure, it is
not. It was a very weil organized force, but it was
defeated by Franco, much before Communism was
officially considered to be bad, much before Yalta
and Potsdam.
It is very sad that Mr. Hilton, Professor of His
panic-American studies at Stanford thinks so poorly
about Spain. He said In- didn't acknowledge him
self responsible for the ideas he presented. He was
assembling other people's ideas. We think he has
not been very successful, as he has presented only
a biased caricatural description of Spain, "dirty
clothes" as Zola would call it. Of course it is much
easier to attract and entertain an audience in this
way.
But, it is unfair to address an audience that knows
very little about an old and noble country and speak
only of selected facts lha{ can create misunderstand
ing and animosity on the part of American people.

He said: "Spanish political life is shrouded in a
nebulous cloud." That is what happens when you
try to explain something that you have not been able
to understand. You only see a "nebulous cloud."
Mr. Hilton does not like cathedrals. He thinks it
would be better that the Spanish government would
give the money to the poor instead ol building cathe

drals. Sorry, it is a little late; they were built before
Franco, centuries ago.
Mr. Hilton does not like Spain because it is Catho
lic; that is one clear fact in the middle of the "nebu
lous cloud."
He continues: "At present Communism is not an
organized force in Fresh news. Sure, it is
not. It was a very weil organized force, but it was
defeated by Franco, much before Communism was
officially considered to be bad, much before Yalta
and Potsdam.
It is very sad that Mr. Hilton, Professor of His
panic-American studies at Stanford thinks so poorly
about Spain. He said In- didn't acknowledge him
self responsible for the ideas he presented. He was
assembling other people's ideas. We think he has
not been very successful, as he has presented only
a biased caricatural description of Spain, "dirty
clothes" as Zola would call it. Of course it is much
easier to attract and entertain an audience in this
way.
But, it is unfair to address an audience that knows
very little about an old and noble country and speak
only of selected facts lha{ can create misunderstand
ing and animosity on the part of American people.

To the Editor:
Our reference: Mr. Hilton's talk about his three
months trip to Spain given in the Memorial Audi
torium.
One misfortune after another. First we have the
Communist party; second the civil war; afterwards
the economic blockade of the U.N.O to force Spain
to be "free." And now Mr. Hilton doesn't even like us.
Mr. Hilton's talk began about medicine. At the
beginning it seemed t«> be a doctor defending his
interest against socialized medicine. Afterwards he
was a spy struggling at great personal risks for the
world's liberties, trying to grasp the real opinion
of the Spanish population whose freedom of ex
pression is very restricted by fear of the secret
police. However he later describes traveling on a
train in an apartment with seven persons all of
whom are speaking angrily against Franco. Con
clusion: Spanish secret police don't travel on trains.
He said: "Spanish political life is shrouded in a
nebulous cloud." That is what happens when you
try to explain something that you have not been able
to understand. You only see a "nebulous cloud."
