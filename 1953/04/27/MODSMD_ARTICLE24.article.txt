To the Editor:
With reference to the letter to the editor in Thurs
day's Daily on the subject of Mr. Rosen's review of
Solomon's concert and signed by Messrs. Gullans,
Fiush, Hunt, Childs, and Miss Wilson:
Mr. Rosen's review of the Solomon concert may
have had its .shortcomings, antl far be it from this
leader to question the right of anyone to take issue
with his statements. However, the above mentioned
letter contained certain dogmatic assertions which
are incompatible with sound artistic judgment or
criticism.
This seems particularly unfortunate in view of
the fact that the letter is endorsed by three music
students and two students of graduate Fnglish,
people who obviously criticize with considerable
authority. With their authority, however, comes
responsibility which should not be abused, lest it
reflect on those who would enjoy its benefits.
Alter barraging the Daily critic with questions
and refusing in advance to respect his answers, our
fi ieiids go on to say that . . wt believe that music,
as much as the other arts, is a matter of professional
concern, and that points of interpretation and judg

ment, whether of the music itself or of the perform
ance given to it, belong properly to the man who has
the professional competence from which to speak."
l)o these five students actually think they can
arrogate to themselves the God-given privilege of
experiencing, interpreting, and judging all that
music, literature, and the rest of the fine arts have
to offer?
But the piece de resistance is yet to come. "The
arts are not for amateurs . . . What we look for in
those less adequately prepared to speak is a be
coming humility toward that which requires def
erence and regard because it is the product of a
mind greater than any of ours . . ."
Gentlemen and Madam, this is dangerous think
ing! There would never have been a Beethoven or
a Chopin as we know them, had they adopted this
attitude. On the contrary, it is precisely this type
ol thinking that leads to a situation where Shosta
kovich is told what to compose and Heifitz is attacked
foi playing works some of his listeners don't want to
hear.
Thank you for your consideration.
