# ASSU Election
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Last Wednesday Stanford men and women went
to the polls with an almost uniform anil predeter
mined opinion on whom to elect for the ASSU offices.
Tliis is good in my mind considering the majority
of votes cast for the winners, and the apparent trust
of the students in the qualities of the candidates.
However, now that two out of the three ASSU offices
have been filled, I fear that the voters may relax
and let the issues of the election slide.
F say tliis because many people have considered
the post of Yell Leader, Che one unfilled ASSI'
office remaining, to be an almost honorary job,
wherein the man to be elected is "a jolly g«w>d fellow
well met." In my mind this is not the case, for in
(lie foil quarter every week the llead Yell Leader
displays to between ten and ninety thousand peo
ple his capabilities in keeping the rooters' spirits
on h high level, in displaying the Stanford Spirit, in
conducting a well-led and varied selection of yells,
and also in controlling the wrought up emotions of
Ihe rooting section at critical moments. His actions
reflect upon Stanford's reputation in the e>es of
Ihe universities and colleges that we play in foot

ball. as well as (he paying public who come to
watch the games. Therefore, his job is as important
as the president's in that be makes as many outside
contacts, if not more, and is also the students' leader
during the games. It is also as important as the
vice-president's job in that he controls a major
part of the Saturday social life of Stanford.
This letter, then, is an appeal to all students to
think twice before making up their minds as to who
would be the best yell leader out of the remaining
candidates. It is also an appeal to those who are not
cognizant of the candidates' qualifications to learn
them, and, above all, to demand to see the men in
action.
In all likelihood, this year will be the last year the
Head Yell Leader will be chosen by means of popu- ,
lar nomination ant) the assistants chosen at the dis
cretion of the Head Yell Leader. Tliis system has
brought forth very capable men each year and there
is no reason why it cannot do so this year It will only
require thoughtful decisions on the part of all of the
student body and their expression of these decisions
by voting next Wednesday.

part of the Saturday social life of Stanford.
This letter, then, is an appeal to all students to
think twice before making up their minds as to who
would be the best yell leader out of the remaining
candidates. It is also an appeal to those who are not
cognizant of the candidates' qualifications to learn
them, and, above all, to demand to see the men in
action.
In all likelihood, this year will be the last year the
Head Yell Leader will be chosen by means of popu- ,
lar nomination ant) the assistants chosen at the dis
cretion of the Head Yell Leader. Tliis system has
brought forth very capable men each year and there
is no reason why it cannot do so this year It will only
require thoughtful decisions on the part of all of the
student body and their expression of these decisions
by voting next Wednesday.

To the Editor:
Last Wednesday Stanford men and women went
to the polls with an almost uniform anil predeter
mined opinion on whom to elect for the ASSU offices.
Tliis is good in my mind considering the majority
of votes cast for the winners, and the apparent trust
of the students in the qualities of the candidates.
However, now that two out of the three ASSU offices
have been filled, I fear that the voters may relax
and let the issues of the election slide.
F say tliis because many people have considered
the post of Yell Leader, Che one unfilled ASSI'
office remaining, to be an almost honorary job,
wherein the man to be elected is "a jolly g«w>d fellow
well met." In my mind this is not the case, for in
(lie foil quarter every week the llead Yell Leader
displays to between ten and ninety thousand peo
ple his capabilities in keeping the rooters' spirits
on h high level, in displaying the Stanford Spirit, in
conducting a well-led and varied selection of yells,
and also in controlling the wrought up emotions of
Ihe rooting section at critical moments. His actions
reflect upon Stanford's reputation in the e>es of
Ihe universities and colleges that we play in foot

ball. as well as (he paying public who come to
watch the games. Therefore, his job is as important
as the president's in that be makes as many outside
contacts, if not more, and is also the students' leader
during the games. It is also as important as the
vice-president's job in that he controls a major
part of the Saturday social life of Stanford.
This letter, then, is an appeal to all students to
think twice before making up their minds as to who
would be the best yell leader out of the remaining
candidates. It is also an appeal to those who are not
cognizant of the candidates' qualifications to learn
them, and, above all, to demand to see the men in
action.
In all likelihood, this year will be the last year the
Head Yell Leader will be chosen by means of popu- ,
lar nomination ant) the assistants chosen at the dis
cretion of the Head Yell Leader. Tliis system has
brought forth very capable men each year and there
is no reason why it cannot do so this year It will only
require thoughtful decisions on the part of all of the
student body and their expression of these decisions
by voting next Wednesday.
