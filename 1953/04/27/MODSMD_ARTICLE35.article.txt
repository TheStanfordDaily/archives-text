The Stanford varsity swimming
team placed first in nine of ten
events while dumping Southern
California, Gl-23, last Saturday in
the Encina pool to notch their 23rd
straight dual-meet win.
The Cards also broke two Pacific
Coast Conference records.
Stanford's soph sensation Dan

when he won the 220 freestyle in
2:09.9, and Larry Heim smashed
the individual 150 - yard medley
standard with a 1:33.5 clocking.
Osborne came back after his
record - shattering effort to win
the grueling 440-yard freestyle in
the near - record time of 4:48.1.
USC's Alan Gilchrist, 1952 Cana

pushed Osborne to his sterling
performances with two second
places.
Aside from Osborne, Jim Gaugh
ran also had a day for himself, win
ning the 50-yard freestyle in :23.4
and repeating in the 100 - yarder
with a :52.3 effort.
In the 200-yard backstroke and
breaststroke, two of the Indians'
most consistent swimmers, John
Weiser and Ashley Jones, walked
off with the honors. Heim's second
place finish pushed Weiser to a
near-record time of 2:18.1 in the
backstroke.
Coach Tom Haynie's 300 - yard
medley and 400-yard relay teams
nearly posted new PCC records.
In the 300 - yarder, Weiser, Bill
Clemans, and Lee Gunnerson
splashed to a 3:04.1 mark, and
Gunnerson, Larry Kill. Jim Lee,
and Gaughran came through with
