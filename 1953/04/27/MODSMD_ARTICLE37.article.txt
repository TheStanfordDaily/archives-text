## 
### 
WASHINGTON. April 26 (UP)—
Sen. Edwin C. Johnson announced
today his Interstate Commerce sub
committee will begin hearings May
G on his bill to let baseball ban
radio and TV broadcasts by one
club in the "home territory" of an
other.
The Colorado Democrat said
when he introduced the bill March
20 that such a provision is needed
to save minor leagues from extinc
tion and halt the "mad path of de
struction" by what he called "the
big city monopoly of baseball."
Organized baseball abolished the
broadcast ban in 1949 after the Jus
tice Department complained it vio
lated anti-trust laws.
