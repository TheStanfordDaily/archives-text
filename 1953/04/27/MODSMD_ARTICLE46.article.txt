# Braves Felled By Bears, 6-3
## 
### 
Too much hitting on the part of
Cal and not enough on the part of
the Stanford Braves was the story
of Saturday morning's game on the
Sunken Diamond as the Cinnamon
Bears gained a (i-3 triumph.
Don Tronstein paced the 14—hit
Cal attack with a single, double, and
triple, blasting two balls against the
left field bank. It was one of these
drives that put Brave Terry Evans
out of commission in the fifth in
ning.
Evans crashed into the bank and
had to be carried from the field.
However, it was later revealed that
the injury wasn't serious. ,
Gil Duncan suffered his first de
feat of the season as he was con
stantly in trouble in the five and
one-third innings he pitched, giv
ing up 11 hits and four runs. Dave
Freeman, who has been turning in
good relief work, came to the res
cue and was touched for only two
runs and three hits.
The Braves collected only five
hits off the offerings of Jack Waltz
and relief hurler Doug Stowell.
Waltz ran into trouble in the eighth
after limiting the Braves to three
hits in seven innings. He gave up
a lone tally in the first when Sid
Hall walked, stole second, and came
around on 01 lie Suzdaleff's single.
For the Braves it was their third
loss in 11 games.
