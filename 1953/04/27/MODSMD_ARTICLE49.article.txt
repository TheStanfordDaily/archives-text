# '56 Excom Is Active and Able
## 
### TOM PEIRCE 
The members of the class of '56 this year have had an unusually
efficient and energetic group representing them on their class
excom. Headed by Ritchie Taylor, Eileen Conaghan, and Dick
Miller, the Excom has flawlessly guided its class through a num
ber of drives, activities, and money-raising campaigns.
As a result of the number of frosh activities which were taking

place in the autumn quarter, the
excom did not become elected and
have its first meeting until the end
of November, ft soon made up for
lost time, however, as under the
leadership ol Spike Lynch a mam
moth class cards drive was
launched. With able planning be
hind it, this drive netted the class
$3,500, which is 15 per cent more
than any other class has ever taken
in at one time.
With this accomplishment un
der its belt, (he excom moved on
confidently to (he planning of (he
Frosh - Soph Jamboree and the
freshman dance. George Koeni«
and Lois I'adclford managed (o

gather together enough talent (o
thoroughly trounce the outclassed
sophomores in the Jamboree,
while Ed Schnicdcrs and Joan
Irving made a stag dance, usually
taboo as a social event at Stan
ford, a great success.
Next on the list was a talent
show, an activity never before
planned by a freshman class. Or
ganizer and director of this was Liz
McCollister. From the outset she
was beset by many difficulties: acts
dropped out, scenery was not to be
had, and Memorial Auditorium was
unavailable. The show was post
poned until April, but when the
curtain finally went up <u seemed
certain that its next showing would
be-on Broadway.
In spring quarter the superior
qualities of the frosh excom have
been in evidence again as Spike
Lynch managed to enlist 75 per cent
of the class in the blood drive.
Looking toward the future, Chuck
Louden, Don Crowell, and Barbara
Yazdi have been organizing the
Cal - Stanford frosh exchange, to
take place on May 1(5, and Dick
Lawson and Thyra Tegner have
been put in charge of the Con Home
parade, a campus activity organized
by the freshmen.
Other valuable members of the

cxcom arc Wes Marx, editor of
the class newspaper, "'56 Fit
tings,'" and Hen Harris and Mar
gie Cathcart, who act as social
chairmen co-ordinators for the
living groups.
In spite of these numerous ac
complishments, however, the slogan
most widely heard in the campaigns
which have been waged recently

has been "Our class, wants more
representation." Candidates for Ex
com, for class secretary, and for
class president all seem to have
that one idea welded as a keystone
into their platform. Their methods
for obtaining this desired represen
tation are without exception vague
and unfeasible, but they still de
clare that it is desperately needed.
