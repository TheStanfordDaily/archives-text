# 'STANFORD—TODAY AND TOMORROW'
## University Building, Land Development Outlined by President's Assistant Wert 
### WALT WILLIAMS 
University building and land
development plans were out
lined last night by Robert Weit,
assistant to the president, in one
of the third discussions in the
current "Stanford — Today and
Tomorrow" series.
Wert spoke before the licta Thcta
Pi and Chi Psi fraternities at the
Beta house.
Discussing first plans for the de
velopment of the present campus,
he explained the proposed dormi
tory building program including a
700-man dorm to replace Encina, a
new womon'.s residence, and pro- i
posed additions to Stern and Croth- i
crs.
Wert predicted a gradual in
crease in enrollment, to reach a
peak in 1%0, and pointed out that
dormitory development has there- ;
fore been given "highest priority" 1
in University planning.
Plans for the new Tresiddcr Un- i
ion were also outlined by the
speaker. He said that $(500,000 is
now available for this project, but
added that results of the recent stu
dent poll on the needs of a new
Union are still being studied.
Described as still in the planning
stage were proposed additions to
the Bookstore and the building of a '

new post ofTicc. He said that both
of these groups have signified a
desire to expand present facilities.
Wert then explained develop
ment proposals for (>,OOO acres of
Stanford property outside the
present campus area. Included in
these plans are the building of a
15- to 20-million-dollar shopping
center and the development of
several light industries.

Concluding his address, the
speakey gave a two-fold reason be
hind Stanford's going into land de
velopment. First, he said, several
agencies are coming in with pro
posals for power lines and roads,
and University officials feel that by
long-range planning they will have
a voice in locating them.
The second reason, he said, is the
fact that now that surrounding
lands in the area have been bought
and developed, Stanford's lands
have become more attractive, even
though they are available only for
lease and not for sale.
Following Wert'.s talk a question
and-answer period was held. Ron
Lemkc acted as moderator and in
troduced the speaker.

and University officials feel that by
long-range planning they will have
a voice in locating them.
The second reason, he said, is the
fact that now that surrounding
lands in the area have been bought
and developed, Stanford's lands
have become more attractive, even
though they are available only for
lease and not for sale.

ROBERT WERT
—Outlines building plans
University building and land
development plans were out
lined last night by Robert Weit,
assistant to the president, in one
of the third discussions in the
current "Stanford — Today and
Tomorrow" series.
Wert spoke before the licta Thcta
Pi and Chi Psi fraternities at the
Beta house.
Discussing first plans for the de
velopment of the present campus,
he explained the proposed dormi
tory building program including a
700-man dorm to replace Encina, a
new womon'.s residence, and pro- i
posed additions to Stern and Croth- i
crs.
Wert predicted a gradual in
crease in enrollment, to reach a
peak in 1%0, and pointed out that
dormitory development has there- ;
fore been given "highest priority" 1
in University planning.
Plans for the new Tresiddcr Un- i
ion were also outlined by the
speaker. He said that $(500,000 is
now available for this project, but
added that results of the recent stu
dent poll on the needs of a new
Union are still being studied.
Described as still in the planning
stage were proposed additions to
the Bookstore and the building of a '

new post ofTicc. He said that both
of these groups have signified a
desire to expand present facilities.
Wert then explained develop
ment proposals for (>,OOO acres of
Stanford property outside the
present campus area. Included in
these plans are the building of a
15- to 20-million-dollar shopping
center and the development of
several light industries.

Concluding his address, the
speakey gave a two-fold reason be
hind Stanford's going into land de
velopment. First, he said, several
agencies are coming in with pro
posals for power lines and roads,
and University officials feel that by
long-range planning they will have
a voice in locating them.
The second reason, he said, is the
fact that now that surrounding
lands in the area have been bought
and developed, Stanford's lands
have become more attractive, even
though they are available only for
lease and not for sale.
Following Wert'.s talk a question
and-answer period was held. Ron
Lemkc acted as moderator and in
troduced the speaker.
