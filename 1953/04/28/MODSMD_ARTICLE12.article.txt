# Con Home Film to Be Shown at Sunday Evening Flicks

It all started in a Cardinals meeting.
"If only we could all see the kids!" someone said.
Everyone knew that was impossible. The children at the Stan
ford Convalescent Home are recovering from serious illnesses,
and the cxcitemenl. of a visit, to*
campus would be far too much for I iu~i« .~i ii i
K " liv tics, in heir mor r sr on mnin.

tlicm.
Then came the next idea. Why
no( fakr a movie of thr ki<ls and
show thai to the stuHrnts?
Mrs. Ruth Atwood, director of the
Con Home, agreed to help in every
way she could, and the student
movie-makers were off.
Dick Castle, a junior in Stern
Hall, took over the project. E. P.
Hunt, associate professor of educa
tion and physical education, and an
experienced photographer who lias
shown his films at several Tuesday
j Evening Series lectures, promised
j to take the actual pictures.
Time \yas short. It was aheady
spring quarter, and Cardinals
wanted the movie for the Sunday
Kvening IVlovics the night before
the Drive started, and for a spe
cial showing during Con Home
Week.
But Castle and Dr. Hunt went to
i work right away, and now, after
several weeks of effort., they have
finished their 15-minute documen
tary film. The pictures arc in Ko
dachromc color. The film itself is
silent, but narration has been pre
pared to go with it.
The movie will show the chil
dren in the wards, at scouting ac

iiviuta, in i.neir morjei scnooiroon],
out on the porch taking stinbaths,
and at their big Easter Sunday Eas
ter egg hunt-
Shots of the University campus,
of our recent Blood Drive, and of
students helping out at the Home
on Labor Day, emphasize Stan
ford's close ties with Ibe lloinc it
helps to support.
The children loved having their
pictures taken. "The only people
who didn't wan* to be in the pie
lure were the adults," Castle ex
plains.
Cardinals have promised <«»
turn the film over to Mrs. Atwood
after this Drive so she can expand
it into a complete record of the
Con Home th roue bout the year,
and can use it for publicity pur
poses.
One San Francisco television
show is already arranging a show
ing. But the most enthusiastic au
dience may well be the children
themselves. "They can hardly wait
to see it," Castle laughs.
The kids still can't come to cam
pus themselves but their movie can
—and will—be here next Sunday
night at the Sunday Evening Mov
ies.
