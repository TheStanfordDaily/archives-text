# 'Man and Superman' --Authenticity Is Key
## 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
"Authenticity" is the watchword for the Stanford Players' pro
duction of G. B. Shaw's "Man and Superman," to be presented
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights in Memorial Auditorium.
The scenery, designed by Wendell Cole, will feature settings
of London, the English countryside, and Spanish locales. Photo-

graphs of the period (the early 4
nineteen hundreds), and of actual
scenes in Portland Place, London,
the English countryside at Rich
mond, and villas in the Moorish
hills of Granada overlooking the
Spanish Alhambra have been used
to get authentic and colorful pe
riod effects.
Costumes, designed by Ilu&o
Mclchione, use the designs of
Charles Dana Gibson, famous cre
ator of the Gibson Girl. Recent
acquisitions of actual clothing and
accessories of Ibis particular pe
riod have been added to the
wardrobe of the Players.
Authentic muffs and boas, high
button shoes, lacc parasols, plumed
fans, and gorgeous gowns will be
used throughout the production.
One prop being used in the play
is a 1902 model Rambler automo
bile obtained from Nash Motors in
Palo Alto.
This horseless carriage, more
than half a century old, not only
provides scenic background and
authentic property trim, but ac
tually takes part in the action of
the play. II is started and oper
ated on stage by members of the
company.

Tickets for this philosophical
comedy may be bought for $1 at the
Memorial Hall box office, DA 3-0665,
or the Peninsula Box Office, DA
2-2122.
