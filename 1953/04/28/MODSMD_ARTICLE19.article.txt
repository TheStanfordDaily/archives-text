## 
### 
BUIXETIN
In a special meeting late last night,
Excom voted to invalidate yester
day's men's Row representative
election on the grounds that "the
Daily did not publish sufficient de
tails on the election."
After long debate, Excom also ap
proved a motion to allow seniors
to vote for graduate representative
in tomorrow's final election.
The invalidation of yesterday's
election followed notification of
Excom members that the ASSU
by-laws specify the publication of
election information by the Daily.
Only 205 students voted in the
men's Row representative election,
and three of the four "winners"
had not placed in last Wednesday's
voting.
To offset this election tangle, Ex
com approved an extra-legal system
to cover tomorrow's general elec
tion. T'ha.t system calls for the in
clusion of the seven men who placed
tops in both last Wednesday's and
yesterday's men's Row Excom race
on tomorrow's ballot.
Though Excom members read
ily admitted that the system was
not strictly according to the con
stitution, they said it was the best
practicable system that could be
worked out at their meeting last
night.
Excom promised a thorough study
of voting procedures.
In moving to allow seniors to vote
for graduate Excom representative,
it was carefully specified that the
provisions of the motion would ap
ply only to tomprrow's voting.
It further specified that a study
of possible future procedures in
the graduate Excom race should
be studied.
