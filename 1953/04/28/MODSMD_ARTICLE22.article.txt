# New Polling Places Set
## 
### 
New voting procedures in tomor
row's ASSU elections were dis
closed by Election Board yesterday.
Two main voting booths will be
located on the campusâ€”one in front,
of the Main Library, and the other
on the lawn near the Women's
Clubhouse, across from the Post
Office.
The area around the voting booths
will be roped off, the board said, so
that voters can enter through one
side and leave by the other.
The booths will be staffed by sev
eral election workers to facilitate
voting. Extra ballot boxes will be
available should the voting get too
heavy.
