Although the president and vice-president of
the student body were elected in last week's
primaries, there's still some mighty important
Ihinking to do before marking that final ballot
tomorrow.
Many of us are nol acquainted with the can
didates for yell leader, for men's and women's
councils—and we bet that not every junior and
sophomore knows the candidates for their class
officers. Nor are we sharp on the yell leader
proposal which will be on tomorrow's ballot.
But it's not too late to get some additional
information if you're interested in ASSU elec

tions. Today al 11 there's an election rally in
Mem Aud.
Classes will not be dismissed for the rally.
Why? Objections — valid objections — have
come from the University's administration and
Committee on Public Exercises. First, this a
short quarter and secondly, only about one
tenth of the student body turned out for the
rally when classes were let out last year.
We fe&l such rallies are informative and even
spirit-building. Perhaps a strong and overflow
ing attendance at today's rally will soften the
heart of the Committee on Public Exercises in
the future. -Ruby Bernstein
