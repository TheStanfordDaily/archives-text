# CAMPUS OPINION
## 'Sit Back Smugly' 
### 
To the Editor:
I can't refrain any longer from replying to such
criticism of criticism as appeared in last Thursday's
Campus Opinion column. I must rush, at least half
heartedly, to the rescue of Ron Rosen, much maligned
Daily music critic.
Certain music majors (or reasonable facsimiles
thereof) are unhappy with Mr. Rosen's reviews. They
say that Rosen is inadequately equipped to criticize
the performance of classical music.
Of the aforesaid musical inagnificos, I can testify
that at least three are more than adequately equip
ped to present intelligent and enlightening reviews
of such events as the Solomon concert. 1 don't know
the other two gentlemen.
From conversation with Miss Wilson and Mr. Frush,
1 know that, they possess two of the most important
qualifications of the good music critic—a wide back
ground of listening experience coupled with the tech
nical knowledge of a musician. Mr. Childs is a very
competent composer, besides having had actual ex
perience in the field of musical criticism.
But do these talented people offer any more than
gripes about the efforts of the less gifted, hut more
conscientious Mr Rosen?

No!
They sit back smugly and wait until Rosen speaks,
then they jump clown his throat for expressing his
sincere feelings. They could perform a valuable ser
vice tor the entire campus community, but instead
they choose only to serve themselves.
Since Rosen has the guts to stick out his neck as
Daily music critic, then he has the right to express
how he (eels about what he hears. If he thinks Bee
thoven's "Farewell" Sonata is uninspired, then he
would be dishonest to say otherwise in his review.
It he is, like myself, only a lay listener, then his
criticisms, ol course, hold less value than those of a
skilled musician. But if no such skilled person steps
lorth to claim responsibility for Stanford musical
criticism, then Mr. Rosen's efforts must stand as
final wold lor most Daily readers.
Instead of spending their time tearing down Ron
Rosen, wliv don't those five musician-authors from
the Knoll help build up knowledge and apprecia
tion of good music at Stanford by offering THEIK
critical services to the Daily?

that at least three are more than adequately equip
ped to present intelligent and enlightening reviews
of such events as the Solomon concert. 1 don't know
the other two gentlemen.
From conversation with Miss Wilson and Mr. Frush,
1 know that, they possess two of the most important
qualifications of the good music critic—a wide back
ground of listening experience coupled with the tech
nical knowledge of a musician. Mr. Childs is a very
competent composer, besides having had actual ex
perience in the field of musical criticism.
But do these talented people offer any more than
gripes about the efforts of the less gifted, hut more
conscientious Mr Rosen?

No!
They sit back smugly and wait until Rosen speaks,
then they jump clown his throat for expressing his
sincere feelings. They could perform a valuable ser
vice tor the entire campus community, but instead
they choose only to serve themselves.
Since Rosen has the guts to stick out his neck as
Daily music critic, then he has the right to express
how he (eels about what he hears. If he thinks Bee
thoven's "Farewell" Sonata is uninspired, then he
would be dishonest to say otherwise in his review.
It he is, like myself, only a lay listener, then his
criticisms, ol course, hold less value than those of a
skilled musician. But if no such skilled person steps
lorth to claim responsibility for Stanford musical
criticism, then Mr. Rosen's efforts must stand as
final wold lor most Daily readers.
Instead of spending their time tearing down Ron
Rosen, wliv don't those five musician-authors from
the Knoll help build up knowledge and apprecia
tion of good music at Stanford by offering THEIK
critical services to the Daily?

Daily's next review.)
