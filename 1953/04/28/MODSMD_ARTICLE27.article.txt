# Orphan Crew 'Starving'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Some sports have training tables; the crew doesn't
even get breakfast.
At the time in the morning when most of Stanford
is just getting up eighteen freshmen—beat, bedrag
gled, soaked hop out of their cars. They are really
a pitiful sight as they make their way to.the Encina
Dining Hall hoping for a good solid breakfast after an
hour and a half of hard rowing. But the Dining Hall
i:> closed. There is no breakfast for the freshmen
crew.
Here at Stanford we have many traditions. One
of them is that the Encina breakfast line closes
promptly at 7(well, sometimes a little earlier,
because the Encina clock tends to he fast). We
cannot break this tradition. The frosli must be
turned away. Of course, they usually make it by
7:30, hut those few seconds count. Encina has a
schedule to stick to.
Once in a while they go in one of the exits to see

if they can't, have their meal. Then the hashers and
tlu- ticket-punchers and everybody else have a great
time carrying out the law. "Sorry. You're late, you
know. Can't make an exception. You'll have to
leave." And the faces at the tables watch as the
eighteen in their wet, torn clothing file sadly back
through the dining hall toward the door.
There are two freshman shells now, pulling hard
to win their races—pulling hard to gel in good
work-out every day. And (hen they return home
(o locked doors. It's really too bad, lull we can't
lei them in and have them sel a bad example for
those who sleep late and try lo make it to break
fas! at (he last minute.
The crew has been trying to earn the sponsorship
of Stanford's athletic department; they have been
unsuccessful. It looks as though they'll never learn
when to quit. So we'll try a new way to discourage
them starvation.
