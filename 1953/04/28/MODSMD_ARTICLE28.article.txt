Mr. Harry E Wilson, Editor
International Volleyball Review
Thank you very much for your letter of April ICth
regarding the quality of our volleyball team. I would
like nothing better than to help our team get to the
Intercollegiate Championships to be held in Omaha,
but unfortunately I have no authority to spend money
for intercollegiate volleyball because it is not part
of our program. We do of course have an intermural
volleyball program but that is as far as I can go.
There are a number of sports such as volleyball,
crew, skiing, sailing, and the like that we would like
very much to take care of financially and control
tlu ough tlu« depai tnjuit, but wt don't huv< the fund*;

available for the sports in which we would like to
participate. There is probably no other private school
in the country having a bigger and more diversified
intercollegiate and intermural program than we have
at Stanford, but with the terrific increase in the cost
ol maintaining these various activities, Stanford will
be lucky to hold to its present program, let alone add
to it. That is the basic reason we have not taken on
crew and attempted to handle it in addition to the
several other sports which are not being covered by
this department I am sure you understand our prob
lem
Again, many thanks for giving me youi reaction to
our team
