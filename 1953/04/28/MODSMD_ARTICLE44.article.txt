# What? Gridders Go to Theater
## 
### 
Stanford's first spring football
session was a mental one as Chuck
Taylor welcomed 104 football as
pirants in the Little Theater anil
toTd them what was ahead this
spring.
l ie said that six of the scrim
mages would be filmed so that the
coaching staff would have an ade
quate chance to determine the
abilities of all the players.
Taylor emphasized that the
spring practice would be devoted
more to sizing up personnel than
consolidating the offense and de
fense.
He handed out offense plays,
which he expected the players to
know in several weeks.
Among those at the meeting
were A 1 Napoleon, highly touted
transfer halfback from Compton,
and Bob Pederson, a terrific quar
terback from Menlo JC.
