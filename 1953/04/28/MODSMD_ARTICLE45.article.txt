# Famed Ski Entrepreneur Tells Sugar Bowl Plans
## 
### BARBIE TUERK 
One of the world's greatest skiers,
and the man who owns the Sugar
Bowl Lodge, lives just a mile or so
behind Stanford.
Winner of over 00 of Europe's '
most difficult races, and holder of !
the world's record for three miles
down lull, Ilanncs Schroll is now
doing his racing with ideas.
His voice, with its slight touch
I of Austrian accent, quickens when he
describes his plans for a chain of
cabins extending all the way across j
Donner Summit, beginning at the
top of Sugar Bowl.
Right now several tons of steel are j
j lying under the snow, which were |
intended to be a cable-car lift capa- j
ble of carrying (>OO people an hour !
into Sugar Bowl. Twelve gondolas |
carrying eight people each will make I
the one mile trip in three minutes, i
Once the new cable-car lift is j
built, he believes that another lift
up to the top of 8,200-foot Mt. Lin- |
coin, along with the cross-country j
arrangements, will accomodate
three times the number of skiers
who now use Sugar Bowl.
"Tell them Hannes Schroll is not
stopping yet," he says. Other plans
include a $1.50 a night college dorm
to accomodate 200 women and men.
Next to Sugar Bowl, the famous 1

down-hiller's favorite subject is
"How to run a ski school."
"What counts is not what you
teach, but how you put it over," he
I claims with a wry wink. "Get good
j looking, friendly boys, very sun
i burned, maybe even with an accent,
j Then teach them singing and yodel -
1 ing. how to make jokes, how to flat
! ter. The skier learns best from some-
J one he likes."
"We Austrians are happy people,"
he added. "It's easy for us to sell
fun."
With Dr. Donald Tressider, past
| president of Stanford, Schroll started
! the first ski lift in California at
! Badger Pass in Yosemite. ,
When Tressider and Schroll started
| Badger, there was no other ski tow
in California. "Our first tow was
just a primitive sled hooked to a
i cable," he reminisces. "People skied
! in riding boots and saddle shoes."
Schroll stayed at Badger three
years, until the first ski-school
j in this country was a success. Then
he moved on again, this time to
Sugar Bowl, iust a valley between
three mountains when he first
found it.
When asked to compare California
snow conditions with those in the
Alps, Schroll commented that Cali
fornia has too mucn snow.
"You don't feel secure," he said.

One of the world's greatest skiers,
and the man who owns the Sugar
Bowl Lodge, lives just a mile or so
behind Stanford.
Winner of over 00 of Europe's '
most difficult races, and holder of !
the world's record for three miles
down lull, Ilanncs Schroll is now
doing his racing with ideas.
His voice, with its slight touch
I of Austrian accent, quickens when he
describes his plans for a chain of
cabins extending all the way across j
Donner Summit, beginning at the
top of Sugar Bowl.
Right now several tons of steel are j
j lying under the snow, which were |
intended to be a cable-car lift capa- j
ble of carrying (>OO people an hour !
into Sugar Bowl. Twelve gondolas |
carrying eight people each will make I
the one mile trip in three minutes, i
Once the new cable-car lift is j
built, he believes that another lift
up to the top of 8,200-foot Mt. Lin- |
coin, along with the cross-country j
arrangements, will accomodate
three times the number of skiers
who now use Sugar Bowl.
"Tell them Hannes Schroll is not
stopping yet," he says. Other plans
include a $1.50 a night college dorm
to accomodate 200 women and men.
Next to Sugar Bowl, the famous 1

down-hiller's favorite subject is
"How to run a ski school."
"What counts is not what you
teach, but how you put it over," he
I claims with a wry wink. "Get good
j looking, friendly boys, very sun
i burned, maybe even with an accent,
j Then teach them singing and yodel -
1 ing. how to make jokes, how to flat
! ter. The skier learns best from some-
J one he likes."
"We Austrians are happy people,"
he added. "It's easy for us to sell
fun."
With Dr. Donald Tressider, past
| president of Stanford, Schroll started
! the first ski lift in California at
! Badger Pass in Yosemite. ,
When Tressider and Schroll started
| Badger, there was no other ski tow
in California. "Our first tow was
just a primitive sled hooked to a
i cable," he reminisces. "People skied
! in riding boots and saddle shoes."
Schroll stayed at Badger three
years, until the first ski-school
j in this country was a success. Then
he moved on again, this time to
Sugar Bowl, iust a valley between
three mountains when he first
found it.
When asked to compare California
snow conditions with those in the
Alps, Schroll commented that Cali
fornia has too mucn snow.
