# Resurging Indians Tackle Unknown El Toro Marines
## 
### 
Weather permitting, the Stanford baseball team, which snapped
out of a two-week-long lethargy over the last weekend, will sguare
off against the Marines from El Toro this afternoon at 3:15 on the
Sunken Diamond.
El Toro is one of the top nines in the I.lth Naval District and has

an 8-7 record this season. /
Everett Dean's men are once
again displaying the form they
showed earlier this season. The
big guns seem to have come hack
to life. Jack Shepard, the big
catcher, has broken out of his
slump as he slammed a tremen
dous homer and a single against
Cal.
Chuck Essegian collected four
hits on Friday and would have "hit
for the cycle" had he not been
halfway to second when the win
ning marker crossed the plate. Ray
Swarts also went four for five.
Pitcher Bob Murphy tossed his best
game of the season.
The base - running and fielding
were also "heads up." Except for
one small incidenhin the Cal game,
the Cards were taking advantage of
the breaks which came their way,
and giving the opposition as few
opportunities as possible.
Coach Dean plans to go today
with at least a trio of
with Don DeLong probably get
ting the starting nod.
