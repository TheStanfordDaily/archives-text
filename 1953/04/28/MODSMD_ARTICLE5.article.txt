## Allies, Reds May Choose India to Handle Prisoners 
### 
TOKYO, Tuesday, Apjril 28 (UP) â€”An Allied-Communist com
promise on India as the neutral nation to handle Korean war pris
oners resisting repatriation was believed possible today.
The Allies nominated Switzerland for the role. The Reds re
jected the nomination. But observers saw the possibility that the

Communists would propose a neutral
nation of their choice to take cus
tody of prisoners unwilling to go
home.
Many quarters expected the Reds
to name India. And they believed
it possible that the Allies would ac
cept India, perhaps in return for
Red acceptance of an Allied proposal
to keep the prisoners in Korea under
supervision of the neutral nation,
rather than transporting them bodily
to the neutral country.
