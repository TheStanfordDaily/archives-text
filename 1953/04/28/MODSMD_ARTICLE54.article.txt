# RESIDENCE OPEN HOUSES
## Freshman Women View Housing 
### TACY SMITH 
Sleeping porches, closet
space, and house traditions will
get careful attention this week
by freshman women who attend
the women's residences' open
houses.
The annual event began yester
day and will continue all week to
acquaint freshmen with the differ
ent types of housing in preparation
for the house drawing, May 7.
House members will be on hand to
show visitors around.
Branner hostessed the first open
house yesterday. Today, Upper Row
houses will be open for inspection;
tomorrow, Lagunita and Ventura
will receive visitors; Thursday,
Lower Row houses will be open.
The last tour of inspection will be
Friday at the Union Units.
B r a n n e r, converted from a
men's dormitory during the war,
houses about 20(1 lower division
women, and is situated near Toy
on and Encina. Two sunporches,
a spacious lobby, and the well
known group spirit are Branner
features.
Lagunita is the largest women's
dormitory, housing nearly 300 wom
en in its six connecting casas. White
stucco walls, tiled roofs, and a patio
make it one of the most attractive
places on the campus. Accommo
dations are mostly single rooms.
Lag has a darkroom, two small
stoics, automatic washers, and a

sewing machine.
"Country club" living has made
Ventura famous. Its 60 residents
living in the converted faculty
apartment house boast about the
rooms with fireplaces, a volleyball

court, a barbecue pit, and mail de
livery. Ventura girls eat in the
Union dining room.
The nine Row houses—Lathrop,
Storey, Russell, Stillman, and
Ilurlhurt on Lower Row, and Gu
thrie, Roth, Jordan, and Durand
on Upper |{ow—house from 34 to
38 girls and a housemother or RA.
The key system, house duties, and
breakfasting in bathrobes arc fea
tures of Row living. Each house
has difTei-cnt traditions and duties,
and some girls prefer the small
group living on the Row to dor
mitory life.
Union Residence houses about 76
girls, and the Union dining room
serves the six Union Units and Ven
tura as well as residents of Union
itself. Union women like living
close to Quad in the center of cam
pus activities.
The Union Units—Elm, The Oaks,
Manzanita, Mariposa, Madrono, and
Casa Espanola—have from 12 to 37
residents. The Units also use the
key system and have house duties
similar to Row houses.
Behind the SAE house is Elm,

the smallest unit, with 12 girls.
The Oaks, formerly Maison Fran
caise, is across the street from the
Firchouse. 'Manzanita and Mari
posa, backdoor neighbors, house
17 and 25 girls and share laundry
facilities at Manzanita. Thirty
seven women live at Madrono, the
largest unit, located near the
Shack and convenient to Quad.
Casa Espanola is occupied by
girls interested in Spanish. Depart
mental approval is required before
a girl may draw into this house.
With so many traditions and liv
ing arrangements to choose from,
housing planners hope the open
houses will help freshman girls
choose their next year's "home
away from home."
