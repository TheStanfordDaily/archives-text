PARIS, April 27—The western
Big Three have agreed to reject any
Soviet proposal to exchange free
elections in East Germany for an
Allied promise to scrap the European
army, it was learned today.
The agreement among the United
States, Britain, and France was
reached in high level talks here
after the North Atlantic Council
meeting which ended Saturday.
They decided that nothing— not even
the unification of Germany — was
worth stopping the strengthening of
western unity through the European
defense community.
