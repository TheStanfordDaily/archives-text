Stanford Graduate
Explains Job
M rs. Judith Dailey
Former Stanford co-ed
Mrs. Judith Fisher Dailey
who now has a position
with Pacific Telephone as
a Service Representative
says:
"A Service Representatives job
is all they say it is! Dealing with
the public as a "Service Rep" is
a true challenge and everyday
brings one a new problem to
solve or a different request. It's
a stimulating job, all right, as
well as an entertaining one.
The people I work with here
in the business Office help make
my job as much tun as it is.
We're all great friends both in
the office and after working
hours. We often have informal
get-togethers or parties. Of
course, we all have one very im
portant thing in common giv
ing the public the best tele
phone service we possibly can."
