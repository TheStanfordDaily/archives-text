# 'MAN AND SUPERMAN'
## Play Reverses Don Juan Theme 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
"Man and Superman" was
written in answer to a challenge.
The play, which will be pre
sented by the Stanford Players
tomorrow, Friday, and Saturday
in Memorial Auditorium, was
the direct result of a challenge
; by a drama critic that George
; Bernard Shaw write a Don Juan
play.
Shaw answered his challengcr by
writing ;i Don Juan piny (first, pro
duced in this country in Nrw York
in 1005) but reversing the tradi
tional roles in Hie battle of the
sexes. By doing this, he .claims to
have created ;m accurate picture of
sexual attraction "in a society in
which the serious business of sex is
' left by men to women."
In this satire on the struggle be
tween the sexes, Shaw is less Niet/.-
schean than comic, fly reversing the
! roles of the sexes the woman be
comes the Dona Juana, while the
J poor male, now in the passive role,
! can only proclaim against the "hor
rible procession of wretched girls,
i cach in the claws of a cynical, cun
ning. avaricious, disillusioned, igno
i rantly experienced, foul-minded old
woman, who calls herself mother,
| and whose fluty it. is to corrupt her
daughter's mind and sell her to the
; highest bidder."
These are the words of Jack
Tanner (Ross Durfec), who serves
as the springboard for Shaw's sa
tirical and comic treatment. In
the end. Tanner succumbs only too
willingly to one of the delightful
creatures (Virginia Royec) that
he pokes lun at throughout the
1 pln.v.

Ross Durfcc, who plays Jack Tan- ,
ncr, is a graduate student of spccch i
atid drama. He has played with '
Eastern companies, and was last j
seen on the stage of Memorial An- !
ditorium in the hole of Claggart in
"Billy Budd." Virginia Roycc, who
plays the huntress Ann Whitefield,
[ was last, seen in "The Knyght of the
j Burning Pestle" as the grocer's wife,

reactionary, Roebuck Ramsden,
who opposes the advanced think -
I cr. John Tanner, is Jay Hern, who
lias appeared in the Players' pro

Pestle," "Murder in the Cathe

sented by the Stanford Players
tomorrow, Friday, and Saturday
in Memorial Auditorium, was
the direct result of a challenge
; by a drama critic that George
; Bernard Shaw write a Don Juan
play.
Shaw answered his challengcr by
writing ;i Don Juan piny (first, pro
duced in this country in Nrw York
in 1005) but reversing the tradi
tional roles in Hie battle of the
sexes. By doing this, he .claims to
have created ;m accurate picture of
sexual attraction "in a society in
which the serious business of sex is
' left by men to women."
In this satire on the struggle be
tween the sexes, Shaw is less Niet/.-
schean than comic, fly reversing the
! roles of the sexes the woman be
comes the Dona Juana, while the
J poor male, now in the passive role,
! can only proclaim against the "hor
rible procession of wretched girls,
i cach in the claws of a cynical, cun
ning. avaricious, disillusioned, igno
i rantly experienced, foul-minded old
woman, who calls herself mother,
| and whose fluty it. is to corrupt her
daughter's mind and sell her to the
; highest bidder."
These are the words of Jack
Tanner (Ross Durfec), who serves
as the springboard for Shaw's sa
tirical and comic treatment. In
the end. Tanner succumbs only too
willingly to one of the delightful
creatures (Virginia Royec) that
he pokes lun at throughout the
1 pln.v.
