# Voting Booths
## 
### 
The Election Board yesterday
reminded voters that only two
voting booths will be placed on
the campus in today's ASSU elec
tion.
An extra booth will be open at
the Village from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30
p.m.
One campus booth will be lo
cated in front of the Main Li
brary, and the other on the lawn
in front of the Women's Club
bouse, across from the Post Of
fice.
The area around the booths will
be roped off, the board explained,
so that voters can enter through
one side and have their ASSU
cards punched, and leave by the
other side.
The booths will be staffed by
several election workers to facili
tate voting, and extra ballot boxes
will be available, the Election
Board said.
