# CZECH STUDENT ON IFB DECISION
## Closing Shocks Foreigner 
### JANE LINDEMUTH 
Closing ol the Sigma Nu
house due to liguor violation is
reverberating over the Stanford
campus today. "Shocked" by the
stand of the IFB, Frank Vorlicek,
ASSU Foreign Scholar from
Czechoslovakia, explains his
views on the guestion.
"I do not. claim to question the
authority of IFB, nor can I claim to
know all the facts of the case. What
1 consider unfair is that one fra
ternity should suffer so heavy a
punishment for what most students
at Stanford, as well as the admini
tration, know to be a regular vio
lation of the Fundamental Standard's
liquor clause.
"Any other fraternity, according
to what I have heard, could have
been caught in the same act. The
clause should be withdrawn alti>-
gether, or something done about
its being regularly enforced.
Somebody could be appointed to
carry out regular inspections. Fines
I'Oukl he imposed if liquor were
found on the premises of the fra
ternity or residence. Closing the
house goes a little too far. You
cannot close all the houses. Stu
dents have to live somewhere.
"I am personally opposed to the
liquor clause," Frank continues.
"Students, the future leaders of so
ciety, should be able to show that
they know how to treat a bottle of
bourbon. Now, one gets the Impres
sion that the average American stu
dent does not know how to drink.
Only justification for the clause can
be found, perhaps, in the desirability
of not associating an institution of
higher learning with alcohol. Hut,
after all, we must admit that, even

Stanford is composed of individuals
who do not find it difficult to go to
j Kossotti's and drink there."
As for fraternities in general,
Frank says,"I have had the privilege
to live in two fraternity houses, ATO
mid Delta Chi. It is a unique experi
ence lor students from Europe, where
such institutions are unknown. I
was especially pleased to discover
how democratic they are. Yet, a
great deal more could be done. With
students living together all the time,
there are tremendous opportunities
in every line of activity.
"Students do not avail them
selves of all the possibilities of
life in common for rulluriti better
ment. They should realize that
proltahly never again will they lind
themselves in so constant a com
pany of people whose primary aim
is the acquisition of knowledge and
development of mental faculties,"
As for America, Frank believes
"Americans are practical individuals,
good-natured, generous, but impa
j tient. Friction and misunderstand -
j ing between this country and West
ern European allies is a result of
this impatience. American diplo
matic personnel in Europe should
| understand that formation of h
| United States of Europe is not a
I matter of a few months. Such a task
! will require a complete re-educa
j tion program covering perhaps sev
eral generations of European peoples,
"By urging European politicians

( to move ahead at a faster rate,
Americans create resentment and
provide raw material for anti-Ameri
can propaganda in Western Europe.
No wonder one occasionally hears
in Europe that the United States of
America dominates the political and
[economic life of Western European
! countries.
''Though quite unintentionally,
most Americans tend to he a little
boastful," Frank remarks laughing.
"When 1 was coming from New York
to Stanford, in whatever state I vis
ited people were always trying to
convince me that theirs was the most
perfect state. California, though ad
mitted to have a nice climate, was
reported to be a little 'wild'. Now I
am sceptical about such reports. I
will have to see for myself."
Born in Czechoslovakia, Frank
studied in France and England after
the last war. Through his travels in
Germany, Switzerland, Belgium,
Holland, and other European coun
tries, Frank has gained an enthusi
j asm for "meeting new people anil
j seeing new places." He will obtain
his Master's degree in economics
at Stanford in June. Following com
pletion of his studies here, Frank
; plans to work with the Anglo-Amer
ican Bank in San Francisco.
Before coming to Stanford from
Europe, Frank was told that nothing
"was easier than to get a degree from
an American university. "After
having completed two quarters here
at Stanford, I must say this view is
not justified," Frank said. "Stanford
scholars must cover a field about
equal to that of a similar institution
in Europe, Studies at Stanford are
facilitated, however, by the use of
basic textbooks. In an average Euro
pean university, the student is ex
| pec ted to do research on his own and
thus to complete the lecture notes.
| With lecture notes alone, he will not
J net through his examinations un
| less hi- 1 has a good imagination."

Closing ol the Sigma Nu
house due to liguor violation is
reverberating over the Stanford
campus today. "Shocked" by the
stand of the IFB, Frank Vorlicek,
ASSU Foreign Scholar from
Czechoslovakia, explains his
views on the guestion.
"I do not. claim to question the
authority of IFB, nor can I claim to
know all the facts of the case. What
1 consider unfair is that one fra
ternity should suffer so heavy a
punishment for what most students
at Stanford, as well as the admini
tration, know to be a regular vio
lation of the Fundamental Standard's
liquor clause.
"Any other fraternity, according
to what I have heard, could have
been caught in the same act. The
clause should be withdrawn alti>-
gether, or something done about
its being regularly enforced.
Somebody could be appointed to
carry out regular inspections. Fines
I'Oukl he imposed if liquor were
found on the premises of the fra
ternity or residence. Closing the
house goes a little too far. You
cannot close all the houses. Stu
dents have to live somewhere.
"I am personally opposed to the
liquor clause," Frank continues.
"Students, the future leaders of so
ciety, should be able to show that
they know how to treat a bottle of
bourbon. Now, one gets the Impres
sion that the average American stu
dent does not know how to drink.
Only justification for the clause can
be found, perhaps, in the desirability
of not associating an institution of
higher learning with alcohol. Hut,
after all, we must admit that, even

Stanford is composed of individuals
who do not find it difficult to go to
j Kossotti's and drink there."
As for fraternities in general,
Frank says,"I have had the privilege
to live in two fraternity houses, ATO
mid Delta Chi. It is a unique experi
ence lor students from Europe, where
such institutions are unknown. I
was especially pleased to discover
how democratic they are. Yet, a
great deal more could be done. With
students living together all the time,
there are tremendous opportunities
in every line of activity.
"Students do not avail them
selves of all the possibilities of
life in common for rulluriti better
ment. They should realize that
proltahly never again will they lind
themselves in so constant a com
pany of people whose primary aim
is the acquisition of knowledge and
development of mental faculties,"
As for America, Frank believes
"Americans are practical individuals,
good-natured, generous, but impa
j tient. Friction and misunderstand -
j ing between this country and West
ern European allies is a result of
this impatience. American diplo

ternity should suffer so heavy a
punishment for what most students
at Stanford, as well as the admini

liquor clause.

As for fraternities in general,
Frank says,"I have had the privilege

As for America, Frank believes
"Americans are practical individuals,

''Though quite unintentionally,

"When 1 was coming from New York
to Stanford, in whatever state I vis

am sceptical about such reports. I

Born in Czechoslovakia, Frank

Closing ol the Sigma Nu
house due to liguor violation is
reverberating over the Stanford
campus today. "Shocked" by the
stand of the IFB, Frank Vorlicek,
ASSU Foreign Scholar from
Czechoslovakia, explains his
views on the guestion.
"I do not. claim to question the
authority of IFB, nor can I claim to
know all the facts of the case. What
1 consider unfair is that one fra
