## Stanford a 'Rich Man's School' Proven Misnomer by Poor Men

(Editor's note: This is another

and Tomorrow" series being pre

program. The articles follow the
subjects being discussed by the
Monday evening talks of Univer
sity officials.)

Some think of Stanford as
"the rich man's school," a school
inhabited by cashmere - clad,
convertible - propelled youths
who spend a good proportion of
papa's bank account raising hell
in a beer saturated social pro
gram.
Such a notion is held primarily
by Lho.se outside the orbit of Stan
ford's community and academic life,
those who glance at the University
tuition charge and assume that each
Stanford student is riding passively
on a well - lubricated escalator to
success.
But those who are more closely a
part of Stanford University, par
ticularly those who are aware ol the
scope of the University's scholarship
program, realize that Stanford i.s
not the "rich man's school."
They realize that:
There are over GOO students
who receive scholarship support
each year.
There are over 1,100 students
who hold outside jobs each year.
There are over 400 students who
wo'rk in University dining halls
for their meals each year.
Such facts represent the results
of an attempt by the University to
create at Stanford what the Gen
eral Secretary's office refers to as a
"balanced social situation," an at
tempt to avoid admitting a tight
nucleus of students from the upper
economic levels.
To insure this "balanced social
situation," University leaders stress
the importance of scholarship aid to
students who would not be at Stan
ford without such aid. That aid
takes the shape of $205,000 awarded

jo students in grants and scholar
ships each year.
Most of the money in the Uni
versity's scholarship program is in
the form of specific scholarships
sel up by private individuals and
corporations. The University it
self appropriates $50,000 a year fru
its own scholarships, a sum which
the Scholarship office considers
inadequate to meet the demands
of applicants.
All of the money is administered
by two group a presidential ap
pointed Scholarship Committee and
the Commission for Student Aid
(for grants-in-aid).
Both groups lace one' common
and sometimes overwhelming prob
lem: screening the huge number of
deserving applicants down to the
few students who actually receive
scholarships and grants.
During the past application pe
riod, 536 men who have been ad
mitted to freshman standing next
year- applied for scholarships. Sev
enty-five of them will be awarded
scholarships. The Scholarship Com
mittee estimates that from year to
year only one out of 10 freshman
applicants for scholarships receive
awards and, according to Mrs. Olivia
Byler, secretary of the committee,
at least half of the applicants are in
keen enough financial need and
high enough academic standing to
merit awards.
"We could easily have picked an
other- 75- who would be equally de
serving," Mrs. Byler said.
Among graduates, the competi
tion for scholarships and grants is
even keener. Sometimes only one
out of 20 applicants receives an
award. For matriculating under
graduates the competition is less
strict. Usually one of every two
or three applicants receives schol
arship aid.
In its selection of students, the
Scholarship Committee sometimes
sees competition forced up to the
straight "A" group of students.
Among those high school students
who have been admitted to Stan
ford for next year, over 300 had
straight "A" averages or straight
"A" except for one or two "B's" in

high school.
The Scholarship Committee is
thus aware that its financial re
sources limit scholarship recipients
to a small part of the actual num
ber of deserving and needy .stu
dents.
To extend those resources and
thus permit more "top-notch" stu
dents to attend Stanford, the Schol
arship Committee has plans to set
up an additional scholarship pro
gram designed primarily for poten
tial student leaders who do not
reach the academic heights of schol
arship competitors.
An additional hope is that alumni
groups which act as fund-raising
corps for the University will con
tinue to increase their efforts to ob
tain gifts for student scholarships.
