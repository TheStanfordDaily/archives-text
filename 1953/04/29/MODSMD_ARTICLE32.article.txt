### 
An eight - game winning streak
goes on the line this afternoon
when Stanford's freshman baseball
nine hosts James Lick High of San
Jose on the frosh field at 3:15.
Slim Jack Heffelfinger is slated to
get the mound assignment from
Coach Dick Clegg. Heffelfinger will
be seeking to add a fourth triumph
to his perfect 3-0 record.
