The heavy hitting of Chuck
Essegian and the brilliant pitch
ing of Don DeLong lifted the
Stanford baseball team to a 6-2
victory over the Marines from El
Toro Air Base on the muddy
Stanford diamond yesterday.
Essegian picked up exactly where
he left off last weekend. A.s>a matter
of fact, he almost "hit for the cycle"
again, collecting two singles, a
double, and a triple in four trips to
the plate. He drove in three runs.
DeLong, though troubled by his
control in the first frame, allowed
but one hit while striking out eight
in the five innings he went.
The Indians opened the scoring
in the fust inning on walks to Tal
boy and Jack Shepard and a single
by Essegian. They added another in
the third when Shepard was hit by a
pitched ball, and was pushed around
on singles by Essegian and Swarts
and an error by Toro right fielder
Byrkett.
In the fourth Essegian's triple,
with Scramagliu and Goodrich on

base, provided two more, and in the i
sixth he pushed home Shepard with j
a double to right after the latter had
singled in Scramaglia from third.
The Marines got their first run in
the fifth tiff DeLong. as Bob Van
deriindin hanged a saftey to right,
and was helped home by a couple
â€¢if errors on the part of Ray Swarts. 1
They scored their last off Phil Page
in the eighth when Al Sigman
trotted home on Tom Preston's
two bagger.
Shepard's beaning in the third J
had no serious consequences. An I
errant knuckle ball by Marine I
pitcher Gene Podge sent him down j
for a few seconds, but he was able I
to get up and run for himself. He |
later blooped a single to center.
Rich Scramaglia got three hits in j
his five trips to the plate.
