# CON HOME
## Animals Convalesce Too 
### BARBARA TUERK 
On one wall a diabolical angel
stuffs green apples into an aw
fully hungry giraffe.
Down near the floor a mischie
vous mouse, ordered to leave
the room, peeps from t>ehind a
laughing cactus.
Near by a pompous squadron of
penguins look on haughtily at a
reindeer "escapcd from Santa Claus"
who is perched atop a mountain
peak.
In the midst of all these merry and
impish animals 130 just as merry and
impish children gather every morn
ing, noon, and night.
It's the dining room where the Con
Home's runabouts eat all their meals.
The pink cows and polka dot
horses are the signature of the
famous Swiss artist, "YVolo," who
started his meteoric career by
doing Con Home murals.
"Wolo" was a Chronicle carica
turist in 1937 when he received the
Con Home assignment. He spent
many weeks out at the home paint
ing the dining room and playroom,
living and eating with the children.
Later he became famous as a teller
and illustrator of- children's stories.
Today's Con Home children, 16
years later, still point out his picture
of himself in the ' Barnyard panel,"
where he is seated sketching his
beloved Alps.
Because it's a dining room all the
animals—from the tiny ant nibbling
at a lettuce leaf to the groggy kitten
floating in milk—are shown eating.
The children's favorite animals
are "Spot" and "Susie," who guard
the light switch in the dining room.
When the light goes on the animals
know it is time to cat, so "Susie"

raises her eyes and "Spot" opens
his mouth.
The children aren't the only con
valescents in the room. The gaudily
striped zebra wears a big bandage
to show that he's been sick, too.
And high on one wall shines what
looks at first glance like a bright
constellation of stars. The children
know better. They know the stai's
are their nurses because the twink
ling Cardinal Block "S" 's on eacfy
star look just like the ones on the
nurses' caps.
When you look into the room you

see children laughing at animals
and animals laughing right hack,
and you wonder who's laughing
harder.
Then you decide that maybe the
great "Wolo" is laughing hardest of
all.

the room, peeps from t>ehind a
laughing cactus.
Near by a pompous squadron of
penguins look on haughtily at a
reindeer "escapcd from Santa Claus"
who is perched atop a mountain
peak.
In the midst of all these merry and
impish animals 130 just as merry and
impish children gather every morn
ing, noon, and night.
It's the dining room where the Con
Home's runabouts eat all their meals.
The pink cows and polka dot
horses are the signature of the
famous Swiss artist, "YVolo," who
started his meteoric career by
doing Con Home murals.
"Wolo" was a Chronicle carica
turist in 1937 when he received the
Con Home assignment. He spent
many weeks out at the home paint
ing the dining room and playroom,
living and eating with the children.
Later he became famous as a teller
and illustrator of- children's stories.
Today's Con Home children, 16
years later, still point out his picture
of himself in the ' Barnyard panel,"
where he is seated sketching his
beloved Alps.
Because it's a dining room all the
animals—from the tiny ant nibbling
at a lettuce leaf to the groggy kitten
floating in milk—are shown eating.
The children's favorite animals
are "Spot" and "Susie," who guard
the light switch in the dining room.
When the light goes on the animals
know it is time to cat, so "Susie"

raises her eyes and "Spot" opens
his mouth.
The children aren't the only con
valescents in the room. The gaudily
striped zebra wears a big bandage
to show that he's been sick, too.
And high on one wall shines what
looks at first glance like a bright
constellation of stars. The children
know better. They know the stai's
are their nurses because the twink
ling Cardinal Block "S" 's on eacfy
star look just like the ones on the
nurses' caps.
When you look into the room you

see children laughing at animals
and animals laughing right hack,
and you wonder who's laughing
harder.
Then you decide that maybe the
great "Wolo" is laughing hardest of
all.
