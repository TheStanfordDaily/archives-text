# Italian Reds Losing Out' States Visiting Diplomat

### WIN GRIFFITH 
I'ilippo Falconi, Consul General of Italy to San Francisco, came
to Stanford yesterday, inspected a collection of photographs of
contemporary Italian architecture at the Stanford Art Gallery,
and talked afterwards about Italian architecture and politics.
The collection he saw has been sent on tour in the United
States by the Italian government and â™¦

includes the most recent examples
of Italian architecture, an architec
ture described by Associate Profes
sor Victor Thompson as "the expres
sion of an insistancc on structure
and framework and a creative tur
moil for something new."
The Consul General, his expres
sion alternating between one of jovi
ality and one of desp conoprn, talked
briefly of Italian political life after
seeing the examples of recent Italian
architecture. He likened Italian poli
tics to the architecture he had just
inspected:
"Sometimes Italian art seems like
a mess. Sometimes Italian poli
tics seems like a mess. But there is
a quest for a new framework and
structure in both."
Falconi sees that "something new"
in the form of the Christian Socialist
party of Alcide De Gaspcri and the
democratic movement that it repre
sents.
Of the "struggle" between democ
racy, communism, and fascism in
Italy, Falconi expressed optimism for
the Christian Socialist government
he represents.
"The fascists are weak and dis
organized. The communists, for
whom we have the greatest fear,
arc losing ground. In the next
general election (next June (>) 1
think they will be pushed even
farther into the background of
Italian politics," the Consul Gen
eral stated.
''And I wouldn't be surprised if
legal measures were taken after the

election to outlaw the communists
in Italy," he added with a wary tone.
Falconi says that the fear of war
is still keen among the Italians, "as
it is among all European peoples."
But. the Italian diplomat expres
sed the belief that the war threat
is not. as great as is supposed by
many Europeans, that, "the commu
nists have more to lose than we do
in an all-out hot war."
Instead of a hot war, the Consul
General believes the Soviet Union
wants to weaken and eonfusj capi
talism and the West.
"Their strategy is one of shock
treatments," he said. "The recent
Malenkov peace moves were not
the result of a new Soviet policy.
They were only the well-planned
lirst step in another shock treat
ment.
"It's like the Finnish Sauna bath
in which a bather jumps from a hot
room full of steam into ice-cold
water. The Russians expect that the
West is not prepared for such violent,
changes in policy and thus hope to
confuse us," he said.
Consul General Falconi left the
campus yesterday with this remark:
"The quest for a framework and
stability in Italian politics has been
helped by the generosity of America
through such moves as Marshall plan
aid. My people are sometimes skep
tical of gifts, but after three years in
this country I am aware not of ul
terior motives but of the inherent
generosity of the United States."
