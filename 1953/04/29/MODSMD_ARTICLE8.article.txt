# Drive For Con Home

### 
Con Home Drive chairmen are
beginning the drive for straight do
nations to the Home this week.
On-campus solicitations chairman
Hank Baumgartner pointed out yes
terday that last year 43 per cent of

to pay for two of the five beds

take their Con Home donations out
of the house or wing funds, hold
special auctions, or undertake
such projects as last year's "Op
eration Baby-Sitter" to get money
for the drive.
