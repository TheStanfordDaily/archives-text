## Buss Sees 'Long, Slow Pull in Asia' 
### R.G. MANSFIELD 
Professor Claude A. Buss of the
Stanford History Department aid
that the United' States can expect
only gradual progress by political
means in combatting the Commu
nist crisis in Asia as he gave the
Tuesday Evening Series lecture last
night in Memorial Auditorium.
Professor Ijo- s -s stressed the un
likelihood of success in Asia if mili
taristic measures are used. Preser
vation of the status quo in Korea
with sharp pursual of truce nego
tiations, plus diplomatic negotia
tions with Red China and in French
Indo-China, seem to bo the surest
ways out of the present difficulties,
be said.
The lecture subject was "The His
torical Background of U.S. Policies
in the Far East.," and Professor Buss
gave brief historical sketches of
politics and economics in Japan, Ko
rea, China, and Southeastern Asia
as substantiation for his conclusion.
In Korea, be pointed out, fur
ther large-scale offensives might
win the war, but they would also
cost many American lives which
could be saved if armistice nego
tiations prove successful. If an
attack of the type used at Inchon
is to be attempted again, lie said,
South Koreans should be trained
and Chinese Nationalists brought
up to go into the line, in the place
of Americans.
"The (diplomatic) path will be a
long one and a stoney one, but we
will have the power to traverse it,"
Professor Buss said in closing.
