# Red Forces Lay Seige To Indo-China Capital

### 
HANOI, Indo-China, April 29 (UP)— Red columns invading Laos
began a seige of the royal capital of Luang Prabang today and
kidnaped 350 Viet-Narn recruits from a training center near here.
The native recruits in the fledgling Viet-Nam army were ab
ducted during the night from an army camp on the outskirts of
Namdinh, 37 miles oi' here. ♦

The daring raid was a
Communist taunt to the hard
pressed French. It served warning
that Ho Chi Minh's Red forces have j
not given up their conquest of j
northern Indo-China despite their j
stab into the state oi Laos.
In Laos, Viet - Minh forces ma- I
lieuvered into a semi-perimeter 25
miles north and east of Luang Pra
bang. Fresh enemy contingents
raced southward to join them after
knocking out the last Franco-Lao
tian resistance pocket blocking the
rebel advance along the valley of
the Namhou River.
Ahead of the encircling force of
six Communist battalions, enemy
patrols equipped with barbed-wire
cutters probed to within 12 miles of
menaced Luang Prabang where the
French and native defenders waited
an attack.
A French headquarters briefing i
officer said preliminary attacks on
the Laos capital are expected within
48 hours.
The French command also dis
closed the fall of Nambac, a French
outpost 50 miles north of Luang
Prabang, to a strong enemy column
after savage hand-to-hand fighting.
Elements of the four to five Com
munist divisions now swarming
over Laotian territory also menaced j
the French Union stronghold on the j
Plaine des Jarres, 90 miles southeast i
of Luang Prabang.

miles of the historic city. . —NEA Telephoto
