# 'MAN AND SUPERMAN'
## Original 'Battle of Sexes' Opens Tonight 
### 
"Man and Superman,''
George Bernard Shaw's philo
sophical comedy, will be pre
sented tonight, tomorrow night,
and Saturday night at 8:15 in
Memorial Auditorium.
The play, written in 1903 and
called by some "the original battle
of the sexes," is concerned with the
pursuit and capture of Jack Tanner
(Ross Durfce) by Ann Whiteficld
(Virginia Royce).
Tanner, the author of a Revolu
tionist's Handbook expounding rad
ical views on love, society, and life
in general, is fully aware of Arm's
designs on him, but is powerless to
escape her fatal charms.
Shaw has no qualms in his glar
ing revelation of the powers of the
feminine sex in their pursuit of the
male, who now takes the passive
role in the battle between the sexes.
Playing the role of the reaction
ary Roebuck Ramsdcn is Jay
' Hern. Ramsdcn is shocked and
angered by Tanner's realistic ap
proach to matters, and tries his
best to remove Ann from Tan
ner's evil influence, with no suc
cess whatcvcAfe
An unfortUn' ; Ae suitor of Ann's,
Octavius Robtnson (Maurice War
ner), expounds the traditional views
on women and love, holding up the

female of l.hc species on an unap
proachable pedestal.
Ociavius 1 sister, Violet (Astrid
Willsrud) is another type of the
"new woman" who dares defy her
family and marry the man of her
choice, Hector Malone Jr. (Richard
Learman), defying also the warn
ing's of Hector's irascible father
(Hon Finebcrg).
Other members of the cast are
Mrs. Whitefield (l)oris Church),
Henry St raker (James Barton),
Susan Kamsden (Ann I'aircll),
and the parlor maid (Judith
Doty).
The production of the play fea
lures an atmosphere of the early
nineteen hundreds, enhanced by
settings taken from actual photo
graphs of Portland Place, London,
the English countryside, and of vil
las near Granada. The scenery is
designed by Wendell. Cole.

chione, make extensive use ol the

ctious illustrator of the "Gibson Girl
era.

perman" is being directed by l)r.
