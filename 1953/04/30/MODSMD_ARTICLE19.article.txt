# The 						Sigma Nu Case
## 
### 
Since the war, the campus drinking problem
has been handled according to more or less of a
de facto agreement, an agreement we believti
is most equitable despite its overtones of hy
pocrisy.
Officially theie has been no liquor on cam
pus.
Unofficially, the University has made no
over2ealous attempt to ferret out persons who
drink by means of a police-spy system.
In other words, the University has not acted
against drinking unless a complaint has been
iegistered or unless evidence has been pre
sented through official channels.
Last weekend Interfraternity Board of Con
trol suspended the Sigma Nu fraternity from
campus until Winter Quarter, 1954.
Admittedly there had been drinking at the
fraternity's party.

The drinking came to official attention when
a woman student testified about it in answer to
a direct question from Women's Council.
The fraternity, on the whole a very worth
while asset to Stanford, was aware of the risk
it was running in serving liquor at its chapter
house.
By the same token, theve was nothing else
IFB could do consistent with the facts except
hand out a stiff penalty.
We don't believe that the stiff sentence will
serve as an awesome example to deter others
from drinking on campus.
We do believe it will make them more dis
creet as to how, when, and with whom they
drink.
And probably, from the standpoint of pre
serving the status quo, this renewed discretion
will be the most profitable result of the sus
pension.
