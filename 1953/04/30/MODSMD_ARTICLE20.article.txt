## Echo: Professor Milton on Spain 
### 
To the Editor:
Your "students from Spain" regret that Professor
Hilton's lecture might serve to "create misunderstand
ing and animosity (toward Spain) on the part ot the
American people." They boast that "Communism, at
one time a very well organized force in Spain' was
defeated by Franco, much before Yalta and Potsdam."
And they accuse Professor Hilton (without justifica
tion) of not liking Spain "because it is Catholic."
Comment: Animosity toward Fascism and social in
justice is a sentiment which no American has felt
it necessary to be ashamed of recently.
Comment: Franco cannot take all the credit for
defeating Communism in Spain. He had plenty of
help from a couple of other heroes. And among the
three of them they succeeded in defeating a good
deal more than Communism. Missing in action: civil
liberties, trade unions.
Comment: Criticism of conditions in Fascist Spain
comes not only from Professor Hilton but also from
Catholic France, Catholic Italy, and Catholic Ameri
ca. For criticism from Catholic Rome, compare the
Church's position on conditions for workingmen as
set forth in Leo XIII's Encyclical of 1891 (De Rerum
Novarum) with conditions as they actually exist in
Spain today.
Franco is again bidding for friendship with the
West and using his anti-Communist record as a docu
ment of respectability. We may have to accept him,
as we had to accept an alliance with Fascist Russia
against Fascist Germany, Italy, and Japan. But we
don't have to pretend that anything but our very
great military peril could bring about even a tempo
rary military cooperation between two governments
so justifiably opposed to oiie another on basic politi
cal and humanitarian issues.
