# Lost Books

### 
To the Editor:
I have heard about students not respecting other
students' property. Many such examples can be at
tributed to "growing up" and "horseplay." But here's
one that can't.
Two books (my own), a partially completed manu
script, a ball point pen, and a folder of notes repre
senting four months' labor were removed from a desk
in the Main Library stacks within the last twenty
four hours. My name was clearly visible on the
folder of notes; I checked out the table in the proper
manner.
Hitherto, 1 had assumed that Stanford students re
spected the Fundamental Standard and the emphasis
It placed on personal integrity. The Library is not
responsible for my loss. But some student who,
either carelessly or deliberately, removed these arti
cles is responsible. Of little value to him. these arti
cles are extremely important to me.
It was clearly my mistake to avoid using a padlock
instead of trusting in the Fundamental Standard.
