# Sigma Nu Thanks
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of
our house, to sincerely thank everyone who has of

ferecl us help in the past week. We have received
many expressions of sympathy and aid from students
and faculty. They have included advice, offers of
places to stay or eat, as well as numerous invitations
to parties. Because of the restrictions placed upon us
we have been unable to accept many of these, but
the feeling of gratitude still remains.
The one bright spot in our whole situation has
been the realization that we have many friends both
old and new who are willing to offer us help at a
time when we are faced with the problem of trans
planting ourselves. Until such a time when we are
once again operating as an organized campus group,
about all we can say is thanks very much.
We would also like to thank the various people of
Palo Alto, unknown to us previously, for their
generous offers of assistance.
