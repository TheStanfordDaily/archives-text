# Hashers Are Ogres?
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Are the members of the crew really martyrs? In
addition to the pleasure which they derive from their
frequent paranoiac outbursts, it is assumed they enjoy
rowing. Having exhausted the student body with
their attacks on the BA.C. for not giving them non
existent money, they now paint the Encina breakfast
hashers black as ogres.
Should these hashers be forced to miss their eight
and nine o'clock classes because these "wet and torn"
crewmen can't leave their salty haunts five minutes
earlier?
