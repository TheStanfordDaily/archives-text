To the Editor:
He the article on the Class of '5G by Guest Feature
Editor, Tom Peirce in Monday's "Frosh Edition."
I realize that a modest amount of egotistical back
slapping and a certain extravagant distortion of facts
in the name of "class spirit" are quite essential to
the survival of the Frosh Psyche—adrift as it is—
in this fiercely competitive sea of battle-tried cam
paigners and seasoned blow-hards.
But before Editor Peirce trips over his swashbuck
ling superlatives and falls Hat on his monstrous
exaggerations, lie would do well to check a few facts.
1 quote from his ecstatic account of the world
shattering coups pulled oft by this extraordinary
group of youngsters:
"Next on the list was a talent show, an activity
never before planned by a freshman class."
'Never' is a long time, Mr. Peirce. And while I'm
prepared to admit that from your vantage point, nine
years might as well be 'never'—there ire some of us
old telies still kicking around who take offense at
the flippant manner in which we are dismissed as
il we had never existed!
I refer to the Frosh Talent Show put on by my
das;; in the Spring of 1944, which, (though prior to
the Dawn of Recorded History), was nevertheless a
darn/i fine show!
