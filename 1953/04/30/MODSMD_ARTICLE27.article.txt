# Stanford's Con Home Program Brings Kids Candy, Excitement
## 
### BARBARA TUERK 
About 15 little girls sat on the
beds. They were wearing white (
pluysuits with red stripes, and each
one had a big red how perched in
her curls or her braids. Some were
holding huge yellow and green bal
loons, some mothered dolls, and
some were cuddling each other. All
were excited.
The five Stanford students walked
in with a banjo and an accordion
and two big baskets full,of bright
red and white candy sticks, and the
little girls iell .silent. They were u
little nervous.
Then l)** boy who walked in first
said, "Now we're going to sing a
song, you remember that song we
all learned last time."
The little girls all remembered,
and everyone started singing,
softly at first, then louder, 'One j
finger, one thumb, one hand, one !
arm, all moving." As they sang
they moved — one finger, one
thumb, one hand, one arm — all
moving.
ft looked pretty silly, and the lit
tle girls laughed. The ice was bro
ken.
For the next 20 minutes the little
girls sang and laughed and clapped.
They went on a Lion Hunt, divided
into parts to sing "How, Row, How
Your Boat," played "O'Grady Says,"
and ended up with a rousing "Come
Join the Band."
■•When the Stanford students
turned to leave the little girls
weren't shy any more.
"When are you coming back?"
they asked. And the older ones
wondered, "Are you coming when
all the Stanford kids come nijxt !
wt»ek?"
The Stanford students agreed
that they certainly would be tun
ing back next week when all the
Stanford kids came, and then they
left. They had to give another
show for the little hoys' ward and
the older "run-abouts."
Once a month Toyon junior Bill
Zidbeck takes a group of Stanford j
students out to the Stanford Con
valescent Home to entertain the
children with candy donated by
William Gunther from the Cellar,
fairy tales, novelty games, and j
group singing.
The whole project was started
three years ago by Fred Chez, and

later taken up by the ASSIJ. Beth
Sieroty and Steve Blumberg
headed the Con Home Entertain
ment Committee lasl year, and
Zidbeek has been in charge (his
year.
"We try to find special kinds of
entertainment, besides Ihe regular
monthly visits," he explains.
At Christmas 40 Lagunita girls
went out to the Home to sing
Christmas carols.
Another day Pete Frausetta from
the Firehouse showed up with a real
live cowboy outfit and a lassoo. The
children pretended to be "dogies"
and the "cowboy" lassooed them,
and all concerned had a whale of a
time.
Zidbeek is planning to take hula
dancers, Spanish dancers, and In
dian dancers out with him eventu
ally. "And you know what we want
most of all," he laughs, "an athlete!
So the little boys can brag when
they go home that they met a real

Stanford star."
Besides bringing Stanford to tlie j
('on Home, Zidheck's committee
tries to bring the Con Home back
to Stanford. They arranged an
art display in Cubberley last j
montb to sbow some of the handi
work the children made in their
Occupational Therapy shop. They
showed sailboats and trains the
boys made, and hot plates, purses
from burlap sacks, and little
wooden note-pad bases the girls !
made.
"We want everyone who wants to
to come out to the Home with us,"
Zidbeek says again and again.
And the children certainly second
that invitation. "When are you
coming again? Are you coming
when all the Stanford kids come?"
What can you say except "Sure
we are!"


AND IN HER HAlR—These ribbon-bedecked little girls at the
Con Home were entranced by songs and entertainment led by
Bill Zidbeck last Saturday morning. Zidbeck and four other
Stanford entertainers visited the boys' ward also, brightening
the day for many of the children in the Convalescent Home.
