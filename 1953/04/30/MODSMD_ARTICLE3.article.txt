## U.N.-Red Talks Evidence Signs Of Compromise 
### 
TOKYO, Thursday, April 30 (UP)
â€”The Communists showed signs to
day of readiness to compromise on
issues blocking a Korean armistice,
sidetracking an Allied threat to
break off the lagging truce talks.
The Peipiiig radio urged the Al
lied negotiators last night to "study
Communist proposals and seek a
compromise." A few hours earlier
the Reds unbent slightly at the con
ference table, producing the first
report of progress.
The possibilities opened up by the
new Communist tack were to be
explored further at Panmunjom to
day.
Lt. Gen. William K. Harrison,
chief Allied negotiator,, shelved his
warning to the Reds about another
indefinite recess after a 64-minute
session Wednesday which he said
brought "some progress."
But it was light, and barely dent
ed the deadlocking issue of what
to do with war prisoners who do
not want to be sent back to their
homelands. The three key problems
were:
1. What neutral country will
take charge of those prisoners?
2. How long shall each side
have to try to talk them into go
ing home?
3. What shall he done finally
with those still reluctant after the
intermediate period?
Lt. Gen. Nam 11, Red truce leader,
told Harrison Wednesday that the
six-month period demanded by the
Communists for reindoctrination
could be "a subject of discussion."
The Allies wanted only two months.
