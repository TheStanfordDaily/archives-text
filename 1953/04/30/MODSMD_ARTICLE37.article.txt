# Frosh Nine Downs Lick

### 
Stanford's frosh baseball nine con
verted 11 hits into a 9 to 2 triumph
over James Lick High of San Jose
yesterday on the freshman diamond
to capture its ninth consecutive vic
tory.
Sout hpa w Jack Heffelfiinger
worked the first live innings on the
hill for the Papooses to ring up his
fourth win of the season without a
loss. Heffelfinger weakened in the
fifth, allowing Lick's only runs, and
Neil Papiano pinch hit for him in the
bottom of the frame.
Another lefty, A! Dunn, finished
the last four innings of the game and
faced the minimum of 12 batters.
Dunn was hit for one single, but he
picked the runner off first.
The Papooses jumped quickly
into the scoring column in the first
frame with a single tally, George
Sclleck collected the first of his
three singles and advanced to third
when the left fielder permitted the
hall to roll through his legs to the
fence. Sclleck scored with one out
on Kay Young's single.
Although they left the bases loaded
in the second, the Papooses didn't
score again until the fourth. Singles
by Heffelfinger, Selleck, and Young
were the pay-off blows in the four
run canto.
Hon Wagner started things off
again in the fifth with a hinglc to
left and advanced to second when
Hob Fisher's grounder sailed into
left field between the third base
man's legs. Selleck promptly
squeezed Wagner home and Fisher
to third.
Fisher scored a moment later on
a double steal with Selleck going
on around to third when the short
stop threw the ball away. Jim Mc-
Dowell then squeezed in Selleck.
Marc Sandstrom knocked home
Young with the last marker in the
sixth.
