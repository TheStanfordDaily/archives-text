# Essegian's Hitting Leads Card Nine
## 
### 
Charley Essegian, Stanford left
.lel .er, has battered nine hits in his
!a-.t 14 trips to the plate. His hit
ting led the Cards to three straight
./ins. Included in this barrage were
i double, two triples, and a homer.
His seasonal batting average has
oared to .337; h"is CIBA mark to
.371. Last, and certainly least, the
Daily has designated him Athlete
of the Week.
When his towering drive was
pushed over the fence by left
fielder Ed Simpson of USC, it
marked the 2tfth homer hit out of
the Sunken Diamond in 20 years
of play. Of thee 28. Essegian has
accounted for 11 of them.
"Of course he is the greatest dis
tance hitter in Stanford history,"
says his coach, Everett Dean. "Fur
thermore, off his general improve
ment both in the field and at the
plate, he rates as all-star CIBA left
fielder and the logical choice for
Athlete of the Week."
The poker - faced Essegian is
unable to foresee his future past
a long stint in the service. He is
considering both pro baseball and
pro football, but the service is
first.
Looking ahead to the more dis
cernable future, Essegian looks for
the Cards to take the CIBA crown.
