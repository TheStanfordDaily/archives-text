# New Equipment Elates KZSU Remote Crew
## 
### 
Surface noises, scratches, and ,
squeaks are a thing of the past as
far as members of the Remote
crew of KZSU are concerned.
Spring quarter saw the purchase
of a new $700 recording ma
chine which is now a permanent
part of the broadcasting equip- ;
me-nt at the station.
The purchase marks the end of |
several years' effort on the part of j
the staff to obtain suitable equip- j
ment. Previously used home-made j
equipment was given a "parting is
such sweet sorrow" send-off by jubi
lant members of the staff, glad to
see the end of the home-made era.
One of the advantages of the ma
chine is that it will provide for
a better quality of recording. Re
corded concerts and other musical
events will no longer be plagued
by recording noises caused by i
faulty machines. Public speakers
will be able to know that their
speech will not be lost in a jumble
of noises.
The main job of the Remotes is
to record special and on-the-spot
events for later presentation on
KZSU. Baseball games, ASSU elec
tion returns, and the Stanford To- j
day and Tomorrow series are some

of the events that have been cover
ed.
Persons operating the equipment
have been chosen from the regular
all-student staff of the station. The
Remote stall, along with those pic
tured, includes Glen Garrett, Pete
Ferry, Larrie MinkofT, John Roche,
Richie Meyer, and Don Lawrence.
Future plans of the group in
clude a complete coverage of (he
coming Spring Sing. The haschalf
games and other sports events will
also be continued.
Any event that may be of student
interest will be considered for re
cording says John Donovan, special
events chairman for the group. He
adds that any suggestions for on-the
spot recordings are welcomed by the
group and may be turned in at
KZSU. "With tikis new equipment,
anything's possible."

The main job of the Remotes is
to record special and on-the-spot
events for later presentation on
KZSU. Baseball games, ASSU elec
tion returns, and the Stanford To- j
day and Tomorrow series are some

of the events that have been cover
ed.
Persons operating the equipment
have been chosen from the regular
all-student staff of the station. The
Remote stall, along with those pic
tured, includes Glen Garrett, Pete
Ferry, Larrie MinkofT, John Roche,
Richie Meyer, and Don Lawrence.
Future plans of the group in
clude a complete coverage of (he
coming Spring Sing. The haschalf
games and other sports events will
also be continued.
Any event that may be of student
interest will be considered for re
cording says John Donovan, special
events chairman for the group. He
adds that any suggestions for on-the
spot recordings are welcomed by the
group and may be turned in at
KZSU. "With tikis new equipment,
anything's possible."

Surface noises, scratches, and ,
squeaks are a thing of the past as
far as members of the Remote
crew of KZSU are concerned.
Spring quarter saw the purchase
of a new $700 recording ma
chine which is now a permanent
part of the broadcasting equip- ;
me-nt at the station.
The purchase marks the end of |
several years' effort on the part of j
the staff to obtain suitable equip- j
ment. Previously used home-made j
equipment was given a "parting is
such sweet sorrow" send-off by jubi
lant members of the staff, glad to
see the end of the home-made era.
One of the advantages of the ma
chine is that it will provide for
a better quality of recording. Re
corded concerts and other musical
events will no longer be plagued
by recording noises caused by i
faulty machines. Public speakers
will be able to know that their
speech will not be lost in a jumble
of noises.
