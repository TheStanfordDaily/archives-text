In perhaps the smoothest run !
ASSU budget hearing since the in- '
fan) days of the University, Excom |
Wednesday night approved next j
year's $29,715 ASSU budget.
The prepared text of the budget
was carefully checked and adopted

within two hours. Last year the
budget session dragged almost .six
hours.
One reason for the efficient, budg
et session was the feround work laid
by special Excom subcommittees
which scoured the various depart
ment. budgets during the last two
weeks. Another was the careful
framing of the budget by Student,
Manager Steve Horn.
In drawing up the 150-page budg
et, Horn based estimates on past, ex
penditures. It. was the first time
that an ASSU budget had been
framed on such a basis.
Rudee! for the fiscal year l!) 54,
beginning next autumn quarter,
represents a considerable reduc
tion over this year's total of $33,-
000.
The reduction was made possible
by a drop of almost $2,000 in thy
expected expenditures of the ASSU
office.
Major source of income for the
year will come from student body
fees, ft is expected that $26,990
will be collected from this source
during the four quarters of next
year.
Another $2,725 in income will be
gleaned from such sources as the
sale of Dividcx, feathers and pom
pons, and rooters' caps.
Expenditures are divided chiefly
between the ASSU Account, which
claims $12,158, and ASSU Adminis
trative Boards which take $12,605.
Another $2,595 is slated for special
programs/
