EVEN THE FROG IS HUNGRY
—The older "runabouts" eat
hearty meals in a big airy din
ing room, surrounded by mu
rals drawn by the famous chil
dren's artist "Wolo." The chil
dren need only to look on the
walls to see that all the bright
colored animals are just as hun
gry as they are.



"VISIONS OF SUGARPLUMS
DANCED THROUGH THEIR
HEADS" —Kenny is more than
ready for his after-lunch nap
after a morning of school and
< m
play. On sunny spring days |
the children's beds are moved
outside, and they sleep on the
long porches outside each of
the wards. The younger chil
dren and the "bed rest" pa- 1
tients eat their lunches outside
on the porches, too.

WEAVER OF DREAMS—Michael is the star weaver in the little girls' ward. She's making a
bright blue and yellow place mat to take home with her when she's all well again. The chil
dren say they love the part of their day they spend in the O.T. Room (occupational therapy to
those who aren't in the know). The reading, writing, and arithmetic they learn in their midget
schoolroom is all organized around their current projects. With their weaving they will learn
about the history of cloth making, and practice adding and subtracting the costs of materials.
Right now they are busy learning about communications, writing songs about Edison and Alex
ander Graham Bell, and playing with a real miniature switchboard the telephone company
moved in for them. Teachers come around to the wa»ds to teach children who are not well
enough to get up for class. Almost all the children are up with regular school classes.


! "ABE YOU COMING BACK
i NEXT WEEK?" —Orley, Ken,'
Paul, Carl, Raymie, and Joe
(he's in the back almost hidden
behind Orley and Ken) wave
goodbye to the Stanford stu
dents who visited them last
week. The questions they and
all the Con Home children al
ways ask: "When are you com
ing back? Will you come when
i all the Stanford kids come next
i week?"


TEA FOR THREE—Carolyn, Jean, and Rosemary are setting the
miniature table in the playhouse for the children's tea-party.
Once a month there's a birthday party in the tiny cottage for
all the children with birthdays that month. From the fresh vio
lets in the vases to the baby kitten on the hearth everything in
the playhouse is child-sized.
