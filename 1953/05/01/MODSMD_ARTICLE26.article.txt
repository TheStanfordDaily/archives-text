# Crown-Minded Card Baseballers Meet UCLA
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
Apparently out of the slump which shackled their run-produc
ing efforts for nearly three weeks, the Stanford baseballers will
attempt to extend their CIBA lead this weekend with a pair of
games against UCLA in Los Angeles.
The two teams will clash at Joe E. Brown Field in Westwood

at 3 o'clock this afternoon and then
again tomorrow at 2 p.m.
Boh Murphy and Phil Page will
probably share the pitching ciutie.-i
for the Indians in the two-game set,
with Murph, the league's leading
hurler with a 5-0 record, most like
ly to get the call this afternoon.
Although the Bruins are bring
ing up the rear in the CIBA pen
nant chase with a mediocre 3-(>
mark, they have probably caused
Everett Dean's nine move woe
than any other college team.
In their first meeting with the
Cards earlier this month, they fell
meekly before Stanford 12 to 4 in
the first game of a double headers.
But in the nightcap they blanked
the Indians 1 to 0 in a game which
sent the Cards reeling for the next
three weeks.
Dick Gilson, a slight right-hand
er, was responsible for the white
washing as he limited Stanford to
three measly singles. He and Ver
lyn Crook will probably pitch for
IJCLA this weekend.
Oddly enough, Gilson has just
been another guy«named Joe to the

re.'.t of the league since he shut out
the Indians, failing to last an inning
in all his efforts since that time.
However, Gilson may revive
when lie sees a Stanford uniform,
while the Indian hatters may have
a psychological block about that
earlier game when they troop up
to the plate to face him today.
Off their most recent efforts, |
though, especially with Chuck Es- ;
segian and Jack Shepard out of
their batting slumps, Stanford seems i
ready to blast the Bruins right out
of the race.
Here are the probable starting j
lineups for this weekend's games:
