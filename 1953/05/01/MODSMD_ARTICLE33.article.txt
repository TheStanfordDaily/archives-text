# Card-Spartan Golfers Clash in Big Match
## 
### 
Stanford's golfers will face their
big match of the year when they
face a powerful San Jose State
squad tomorrow morning at 9 on
the local links.
San Jose drubbed the Cards 18-
9 in their last outing to give Stan
ford their sole defeat of the year,
but Finger is confident Stanford
can win on their home course.
San Jose boasts five good men
and a great number one man, Ken
Venturi. The poker-faced Venturi
rates among the top handful of
amateurs in the nation. He is two
time city champ, holder of the
Harding Park course record, ex
state champ. Northern California
champ, and undefeated in dual
meet play since Stanford's Fred
Brown defeated him last year. In
the United States-Canada-Mexico
matches last summer "the Kid," as
the other amateur greats called
Venturi, starred as America won
the matches. He could earn big
money on the pro circuit, but
chooses to remain amateur.
The Man to Beat
Stanford Coach Bud Finger has
not named the man who will at
tempt to beat the machine - like
Venturi. It might be Fred Brown,
who always is at his best against
Venturi, and it might be Grant

Spaeth, who battled Venturi even
ly through 32 holes of the North
ern California Tournament.
Finger has stated that Dailey ai
his best beat Venturi at his
best; in fact, Finger believes that
Dailey at his best can beat any
body. Someday Dailey will shoot
the round he is capable of, and
the course record of 615 will be
smashed," he prophecies.
Brown May Be Out
A bigger headache than Venturi
is the fact that Fred Brown, on *
of the steadiest golfers in Farm
history, may be forced to miss the
big match in order to take a mili
tary intelligence test.
Definite starters for Stanford
include Dailey. Spaeth, and Art
Schroeder. Other starters will be
chosen from Brown, Stu Ledbet
ter, Bob Sims, Bob Blackburn, and
a "surprise starter" that Finger
may throw in to replace Brown.
And here's a hint to loafers
who want to watch a little good
golf but shudder at the 9 a.m.
starting time. The golfers pass by
the tenth hole, next to the park
ing lot, at 11 a.m.
Stanford's good and deep fresh
men will meet the Spartan frosh
tomorrow too. They'll tee olf after
the varsity match.—M. H.

The Man to Beat
Stanford Coach Bud Finger has
not named the man who will at
tempt to beat the machine - like
Venturi. It might be Fred Brown,
who always is at his best against
Venturi, and it might be Grant

Spaeth, who battled Venturi even
ly through 32 holes of the North
ern California Tournament.
Finger has stated that Dailey ai
his best beat Venturi at his
best; in fact, Finger believes that
Dailey at his best can beat any
body. Someday Dailey will shoot
the round he is capable of, and
the course record of 615 will be
smashed," he prophecies.
Brown May Be Out
A bigger headache than Venturi
is the fact that Fred Brown, on *
of the steadiest golfers in Farm
history, may be forced to miss the
big match in order to take a mili
tary intelligence test.
Definite starters for Stanford
include Dailey. Spaeth, and Art
Schroeder. Other starters will be
chosen from Brown, Stu Ledbet
ter, Bob Sims, Bob Blackburn, and
a "surprise starter" that Finger
may throw in to replace Brown.
And here's a hint to loafers
who want to watch a little good
golf but shudder at the 9 a.m.
starting time. The golfers pass by
the tenth hole, next to the park
ing lot, at 11 a.m.
Stanford's good and deep fresh
men will meet the Spartan frosh
tomorrow too. They'll tee olf after
the varsity match.—M. H.

Stanford's golfers will face their
big match of the year when they
face a powerful San Jose State
squad tomorrow morning at 9 on
the local links.
San Jose drubbed the Cards 18-
9 in their last outing to give Stan
ford their sole defeat of the year,
but Finger is confident Stanford
can win on their home course.
San Jose boasts five good men
and a great number one man, Ken
Venturi. The poker-faced Venturi
rates among the top handful of
amateurs in the nation. He is two
time city champ, holder of the
Harding Park course record, ex
state champ. Northern California
champ, and undefeated in dual
meet play since Stanford's Fred
Brown defeated him last year. In
the United States-Canada-Mexico
matches last summer "the Kid," as
the other amateur greats called
Venturi, starred as America won
the matches. He could earn big
money on the pro circuit, but
chooses to remain amateur.
