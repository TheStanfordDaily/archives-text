The Stanford Players last
night showed their ability to
handle a tough G. B. Shaw satire
with competence.
Technical and directing staffs,
joined with a well-chosen cast, re
sulted in a successful production of
"Man and Superman."
The show started slowly, got its
biggest push in Act II with the
acceleration of 'Enry Stakcr
(James Rarton) and his motor car,
and elided through Act 111 to a
smooth finish. The curtain fell on
the applause of a well - pleased
audience.
Ross Durfee, in the leading and
exacting role of the revolutionary
John Tanner (exponent of Shaw's
philosophy throughout the play),
managed to keep the audience in
the palm of his hand. Though em
ploying stock gestures, his charac
terization, stage bearing and read
ing of Shaw's often difficult lines,
were convincing.
Maurice Warner as Tavy Rob
inson, "the man who always gets
the girl," by being a little too
"milquetoasty," failed to win the
sympathy of the audience. His
makeup only added to his meek
ness.
The heroine, Ann Whitefield
(Virginia Royce), did a competent
job. From remoter parts of the the
ater, she looked and sounded more
sophisticated than one likes to pic
ture an ingenue. Her vitality came
through better at close range.
The leads were skillfully support
ed. Roebuck Ramsden (Jay Hern)
and Mrs. Whitefield (Doris Church)
were outstanding. An exception
was Hector Malonc Sr. (Ron Fein
burg), whose lines were indistin
guishable. This resulted in the loss
of Malone's characterization and
sonic of Shaw's wittiest lines.
Special praise goes to the sets,
enclosed within the proscenium,
which favorably limited the stage to
a small area suitable for Shaw com
edy.
