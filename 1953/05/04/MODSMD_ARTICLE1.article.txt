Chapparal artist Tom Johnson. Jerry
Fitzgerald is in charge of Tag Day.
She is being helped by Lois Padrl
ford, Liz McCollister, Sue Hirst, and
Carol Strauss.
Tag Day will launch Stanford on h
whole week of events for the benefit
of the Con Home children.
Strawberry shortcake will he on
tap tomorrow in Union Court from
10 to 3 at the YWCA Freshman
Women's "Strawberry Brunch."
Campus residences will not serve
desserts, and will donate the money
they do not spend to the drive.
Students will travel to the Con
Home itself for Wednesday's big
Labor Day and Sam McDonald Bar
becue. With the Alpha Delts' jazz
band providing entertainment, stu
dents will garden, clean up, and paint
toys in the afternoons, and eat
steaks cooked by Sam McDonald,
the Con Home's oldest benefactor,
in the evening. Campus residences
will not serve dinner Wednesday
night, so that all students can go
to the barbeque.
Women's Row coeds will donate
elbow grease to the drive on
Thursday, when they'll be washing
cars for the campus at $1 a car.
Cars may be delivered to Lathrop,
Stillman, Guthrie, Hurlburt, or

Marching bands, clowns, circus
stunts, and an old car procession

Paraders will march through Palo
Alto and campus streets to advertise
the drive and to drum up business
for the Soph Carnival Friday night
in the Pavilion.
Beginning tonight 50 couples will
spend the next five nights traveling
from door to door in the Stanford
area in search of donations from
near-by residents. This year for the
first time Menlo Park and Atherton

the eoyplcs getting the most dona

On campus students will all be
asked to make individual contribu

two weeks, will conclude this week.
