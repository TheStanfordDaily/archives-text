(Editor's note: This is the first
of two articles on the Stanford
Convalescent Home's history. The
story of Stanford's work for the
Home will be told tomorrow.)

"The children of California
shall be my children."
Senator Leland Stanford's of
ten-repeated words are the mot
to for the Stanford Convalescent
Home, which is located on the
site of his former home.
Here, in a sccludcd spot nestled
between El Camino Real, San Fran
cisquito Creek, and the campus, 80
children rest, play, and even go to
school in the sunshine and fresh air
they cannot find in the crowded
cities they come from.
The children may be any age from
four to 12, from any race or creed,
and from any sort of financial back
ground. But they all have one thing
in common; all are recovering from
serious illnesses such as rheumatic
fever or polio which require months
of healthy living to be cured.
The only illnesses not treated at
the Home are epilpsy, diabetes,
mental deficiency, or communicable
diseases such as tuberculosis.
Most of the children come from
the Bay Area or California, but
some come from as far away as
Reno. They stay as long as they
need to be well again (eight
months on the average) and their
parents pay as much as they can
afford of the $2,000 a year the
llome spends on each child.
Children arc admitted into the
Home on their doctors' recommen
dations, according to need and the
waiting list. In the home they re
ceive medical care from Dr. Harold
K. Fabcr, the Home's staff doctor,
and a staff of Palo Alto pediatri
cians.
About 40 nurses, nurses' aides,
housemothers, teachers, and one oc
cupational therapist live at the
Home with the children to give them
the kind of special carc they could
not get at home.
Each of the big sunny wards opens
Besides the original Stanford res
idence, the Home has three new
units or wards, and is now building
an administration building.

Each of the big sunny wards
opens on a garden terrace, where
the children eat. and take their naps
in warm weather.
The "runabouts" (children well
enough to be out of bed) play in
a big garden with swings and tee
ter-totters, climbing trees, a tree
bouse, a miniature playhouse, and
huts for the Brownie and Cub
Scout troops.
Jhe $8.75 a day it costs to keep a
child at the Con Home guarantees
hearty meals, special physical ther
apy equipment, and playthings —
trains, dolls, paint sets, and games.
The Home started in 1917 as a
summer camp for convalescing chil
dren. It was organized and run at
first by Dr. D. Charles Gardner,
Stanford's first chaplain, with the
help of a lew University students.
The camp was a success, and two
years later was put on an all-year
round basis. The Stanford Univer
sity Board of Trustees gave the new
institution 27 acres of University
land and the old Stanford residence
on a $1 a year lease. Dr. Gardner
was the first president of the Board
of Directors.
The home was financed at first
by the generosity of Bay Area
people and by the work of several
auxiliaries formed in nearby
towns.
Today it relics on the interest
from its endowment fund, sums
from parents who arc able to pay
for their children's care, and con
tributions from the San Fran
cisco Community Chest, the Stan
, ford Convalescent Home Senior
j and Junior Auxiliaries, and the
J Stanford Spring Con Home Drive.
Stanford's drive raises enough
funds to support five*of the eighty
beds in the home.
The nurses at the Home say the
children depend on the students for
far more than financial aid. The
ASSU entertainment programs once
a month and occasional .spontaneous
visits arc wonderful morale boosters
for the children.
Students urc urged to wine out
and see the home and meet the
children whenever they can. A few
hours on a busy spring afternoon
may start a friendship which will
last into the years. And friendships
arc what the Con Home is built
upon.


TAG DAY— Some 4,500 tags like this will be sold to students
today to mark the opening of Con Home Week. Freshman coeds
—170 of them—will be posted around campus peddling them.
Price is 10 cents. Chappie artist Tom Johnson designed the tags.
