## IFB Action

To the Editor:
A common misunderstanding has arisen as a re
sult of last week's decision by the Interfraternity
Board. As President of Board at the time of the
incident, I am fully aware of all the facts in the case.
Although a Stanford coed may have admitted being
present at the Sigma Nu house on the night of the
party, her testimony before Women's Council had no
bearing on the case whatsoever. The coed had no in
tention of involving the fraternity in her quandry,
and in fact, did not.
Many people are now inclined to believe that the
Sigma Nu's would not have been brought before the
Board but for the testimony in the Women's Council
hearing. This is definitely not the case.
Students at Stanford University have the responsi
bility of policing the problem of drinking. The Inter
fraternity Board of Control and other authorized

groups will assume jurisdiction over any indiscreet
judgments made by Stanford students regarding the
drinking question.
Under the power granted to the Interfraternity
Board of Control by President Sterling, penalties
will be imposed on fraternity groups as will be the
case with Men's and Women's Council, in meting out
penalties lor violations under their jurisdictions.
The fraternity presidents have been warned peri
odically against drinking, and the penalties assessed
thereto. In holding a full Hedged costume party on
campus, with guests in attendance, the Sigma Nu's
brought themselves into vivid focus, and necessitated
a hearing. The testimony by the Sigma Nu house
officers, in the IFB hearing and not that in Women's
Council, produced the resulting suspension.
