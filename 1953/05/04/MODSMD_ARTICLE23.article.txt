# Rosen: A Personal Explanation
## 
### 
To the Editor:
In answer to all the conjecture as to my background
in music, I shall begin this letter with a statement
of my musical training and experience.
I studied piano for 10 years, and at one time the
Superintendent of Music in Los Angeles schools
(and later Publicity Manager for the L.A. Philhar
monic) said that I might become a concert pianist,
after hearing me play. Realistically though, I did not
have the talent to become a concert pianist. I have
not played the piano very much since giving up my
study when I was 17. However, I have studied har
mony and solfege, and I have also composed some
music in the past.
Thus, while my accomplishments are not of the
quality of Mr. Childs, et.al, I have had training which
gives me some advantage over the average lay listener.
My views, in many cases, are conditioned by the
training I received earlier. And as is the case with
most human beings, I Can't avoid comparisons when
I listen to a concert. Considering all these things, 1
have tried at all times to be objective, but subjective
opinions can never be avoided in music criticism.
1 think that Solomon is a great artist, but one must
never be awed by clippings, nor neglect the fact
that the greatest have off nights. When I wrote the
Solomon reviejv, I couldn't help but feel that his
performance was not up to par in regard to musical
content and expression. If Mr. Childs and his friends
feel otherwise, they certainly have a right to their
opinions. However, they must not forget that many
people look for different things in musical perform
ances. In anything so highly complex, it is very dif
ficult to say that a man is all good or all bad unless
his performance is unquestionably outstanding. I
didn't feel that Solomon reached sua!) perfection.

As to statements about the "Les Adieux" being
written between two of Beethoven's greatest works,
this certainly doesn't make it good or bad. Bee
thoven's Battle Symphony was written at the height
of his powers, and yet there are few musicologists
who would say that it is worthy of Beethoven. My
subjective (it you will) opinion is that the "Les
Adieux" is not the best Beethoven.
J am not trying to apologize for anything. This
letter is merely to show that I have had some back
ground in music. I don't feel that being a music
major is a be-all or end-all of anything. There are
many people on campus whose tastes are just as
refined as those of music majors and who arrive at
different conclusions regarding performances.
I am sincerely happy that criticisms of my views
have come in, because active interest in music is
something close to my heart. However, this musical
interest should never assume the haughty attitude
it did. It belied a certain intolerance toward the
opinions of a "layman."

most human beings, I Can't avoid comparisons when
I listen to a concert. Considering all these things, 1
have tried at all times to be objective, but subjective
opinions can never be avoided in music criticism.
1 think that Solomon is a great artist, but one must
never be awed by clippings, nor neglect the fact
that the greatest have off nights. When I wrote the
Solomon reviejv, I couldn't help but feel that his
performance was not up to par in regard to musical
content and expression. If Mr. Childs and his friends
feel otherwise, they certainly have a right to their
opinions. However, they must not forget that many
people look for different things in musical perform
ances. In anything so highly complex, it is very dif
ficult to say that a man is all good or all bad unless
his performance is unquestionably outstanding. I
didn't feel that Solomon reached sua!) perfection.

As to statements about the "Les Adieux" being
written between two of Beethoven's greatest works,
this certainly doesn't make it good or bad. Bee
thoven's Battle Symphony was written at the height
of his powers, and yet there are few musicologists
who would say that it is worthy of Beethoven. My
subjective (it you will) opinion is that the "Les
Adieux" is not the best Beethoven.
J am not trying to apologize for anything. This
letter is merely to show that I have had some back
ground in music. I don't feel that being a music
major is a be-all or end-all of anything. There are
many people on campus whose tastes are just as
refined as those of music majors and who arrive at
different conclusions regarding performances.
I am sincerely happy that criticisms of my views
have come in, because active interest in music is
something close to my heart. However, this musical
interest should never assume the haughty attitude
it did. It belied a certain intolerance toward the
opinions of a "layman."

To the Editor:
In answer to all the conjecture as to my background
in music, I shall begin this letter with a statement
of my musical training and experience.
I studied piano for 10 years, and at one time the
Superintendent of Music in Los Angeles schools
(and later Publicity Manager for the L.A. Philhar
monic) said that I might become a concert pianist,
after hearing me play. Realistically though, I did not
have the talent to become a concert pianist. I have
not played the piano very much since giving up my
study when I was 17. However, I have studied har
mony and solfege, and I have also composed some
music in the past.
Thus, while my accomplishments are not of the
quality of Mr. Childs, et.al, I have had training which
gives me some advantage over the average lay listener.
My views, in many cases, are conditioned by the
training I received earlier. And as is the case with
most human beings, I Can't avoid comparisons when
I listen to a concert. Considering all these things, 1
have tried at all times to be objective, but subjective
opinions can never be avoided in music criticism.
