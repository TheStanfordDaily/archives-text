To the Editor:
The election is over; the ballots have been counted;
the winner has been selected. The vigorous enthusi
asm with which we candidates competed for the
position of Head must now be employed
to unify the entire student body for the creation of
a stronger Stanford spirit. I ask all those who voted
for me, as well as for the other candidates to get
behind the new Head Yell Leader and help him lead
us on to greater victory in the coming year.
