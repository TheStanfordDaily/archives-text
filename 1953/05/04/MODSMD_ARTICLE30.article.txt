# 'Preaching the Word' Is Theme Of Chaplain Minto's Sunday Sermon
## 
### 
In his sermon on "The Preaching
of the Word" at Memorial Church's
11 a.m. service of worship yesterday
morning, the Rev. R. M. Minto de
scribed "the place and function of j
preaching in the Christian church"
as the proclamation of the great
truth of the Christian faith, Jesus
Christ's resurrection.
Chaplain Minto pointed out that I
preaching is not the main section of
the service, hut a "part of worship"
in that it "sets forth Jesus Christ
himself and proclaims the good j

news about God," that God "acts in
human life and has acted in Jesus
Christ."
According to Minto, preaching is
not just an exposition of Christian
faith. It also concerns people fol
lowing the challenge of their faith,
and "deciding between faith and
unbelief, between acceptance and
rejection." He said preaching after
the service of worship should help
people to leave the church with a
"spirit of faith, commitment, and
obedience."
