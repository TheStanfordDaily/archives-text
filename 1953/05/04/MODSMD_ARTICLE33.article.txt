# Indian Batmen Split with Bruins Crown Tie
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
JOE E. BROWN FIELD. Westwood, May 2—We're almost in. •
Stanford lost a ball game to UCLA here this afternoon 10 to 6, but even so clinched a tie for
the Pacific Coast Conference baseball championship. The loss today gave the Cards a split in the
weekend series with the Bruins as Bob Murphy blanked UCLA 2 to G yesterday.
Thus, the Indians are almost in in qualifying for the PCC playoffs which will be held in the
Southern Division on May 29-30.
USC, which knocked off Cal twice this weekend, and the Bears each have a chance to tie
Stanford for the title in the PCC if either one of them wins all their remaining games and the

Cards lose all of theirs.
In this "league within the
< lUA" only games against PCC
Schools are counted, and all ac
tion with Santa Clara is discount
ed in determining the PCC rep
resentative for the playoffs.
Incidentally, the winner of tho
division playoffs will probably be
tlit* District Eight representative in
tlie NCAA tournament at Omaha
beginning June 11. Selection of the
team will be later this season.
Getting back to this weekend's
games, it can be simply said that
they were a study in contrasts.
Yesterday, the Cards played
tfreat hall to hlanlc the Bruins he
hind Murphy, and then were

thumped by UCLA today in as
sloppy a ball game as you could
imagine.
Murphy, who has a 6-0 record in
CIBA play, wits as right as a pitcher
could ever be, and he had to be as
the Bruins' Marty Stiles was also in
rare form.
In complete control all the way,
I Bob scattered four singles, two of
j the scratchy variety, surrendered
j but one base on balls, that coming
I with two out in the ninth, and al
; lowed only one man to reach sec
: ond, and that came on an over
! throw.
A true indication of Murphy's
effectiveness can be illustrated as
he retired Hi men in a row from
the second through seventh in
nings. He set down the side on
only five pitches in the fifth in
ning and fanned the side on 12
pitches in the sixth.
The Indians' runs came hard yes-
I terday as it took them five innings

to solve the fastballing Stiles.
With one down in the top of the
sixth, Warren Goodrich lined a sin
gle to center and then with the hit
and run on scored as Al Talboy
lined a long double to left field
corner.
The Cards gave Murphy an in
: uranee run in the top of the eighth.
Rich Scramaglia got a life when
UCLA catcher Don Foster dropped
his foul pop. Scrag then beat out a
hit to short and stole second. He
moved to third on Talboy's infield
hit and then tallied on Jack Shep
ard's line single to right.
This afternoon, Everett Dean tried
to gamble but. lost.
He selected left-hander Don De-
Long oas his starting pitcher, and
although the speedballer was staked
to a three-run lead in the first in
ning. he just didn't have it.
Don gave up two runs in the bot
tom of the first and was batted out
in second when the Bruins scored
a big live run.s. Ken Brown came to
his relief, but couldn't put out the
fire.
The crusher in the big frame
for the Bruins came when right
fielder Frank Ernaga lined a sin
gle to left with the bases loaded
to score two runs. Then he and
everyone else came home when
Essegian let the ball roll through
his legs for an error.
Ernaga was the big noise for the
Bruins all afternoon as he hatted
in a total of six runs and had three
for three, including a two-run
homer.
Dick Gilson, Bruin pitcher, though
pounded hard the first three innings,
settled down when once he had the
lead and held off Stanford for his
second win over the Indians this
year. He is the only collegiate
pitcher to hold that distinction.
Essegian was the only Card to do
anything at the plate as he hit an
inside the park home run with no
one on in the third and also
knocked out two singles.
