# Card Golfers Trounce San Jose
## 
### ELMORE SEEDS 
—A pair of great golfers had a great day against the great Ken Venturi

Led by sophomore Warren Dailey's conquest of the renowned
Kenny Venturi, Stanford's varsity golf team smashed San Jose
State in surprisingly easy fashion, 26-1, Saturday in a match played
on the local course.
The victory gave Coach Bud Finger's Cards undisputed claim

to the dual match championship of k
the Southern Division area. They I
had already defeated the three con
ference foes, SC, UCLA, and Cal.
and a win over the Spartans, the j
only other major golf power in the
area, set them up as king of the
roost. It was also sweet revenge for
the only defeat the Cards have suf
fered this season, administered by j
San Jose several weeks ago on the ;
Spartan course.
Dailey, a_ happy -go - lucky 175-
pounder who hits the ball a country
mile, pulled the upset of the day
in downing Venturi, but it was no
fluke the way Warren was canning
birdie putts. Venturi, who has won
so many honors it would take the
rest of the column to mention them, j
had trouble staying on the course i
(hitting two balls out of bounds)
and that was more than enough to
put him out of it against Dailey's
six birdies and one-under-par 70.
Venturi had a 74.
The scoring in golf matches goes
like this: one point for the first
nine, one for the second nine, and
one for the eighteen. Thus each
individual match is worth three
points. There is also three points
lor a best - hall match in each
foursome.
Dailey took 2 1 •> points while Ven
turi rolled in a 30-footer on the 18th
green for a birdy and a half for the
back nine worth Vz point.
Fred Brown, playing number two '
lor the Cards, carded 1(5 pars while
firing a steady 71 to sweep all three 1
points in his match. Dailey and !
Brown's best-ball score, a sensa
tional seven - under - par 64. gave
Stanford three more points.
Art Schroeder had a 72. and Stu
Lcdbettcr a 7(i. as the duo swept
all nine points in their foursome.
Grant Spaeth and Boh Blackburn
shot 74 and 77 respectively as
Stanford dropped only '2 point
in the final foursome.
It was quite a day for Stanford
golfers, whose next competition will
be the annual Southern Division
championships in Los Angeles this !
week.
The freshmen also romped at the \
expense of the Spartan freshmen, |
24 l fj-2''j. Bob Barneson and Ray
Silliman led the way with 76's.
