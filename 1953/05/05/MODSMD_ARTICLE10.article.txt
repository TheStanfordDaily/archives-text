# Olvis Displays Pleasant Voice
## 
### BARNEY CHILDS 
William Olvis, tenor, in the
last ASSU recital of the year last i
night, was impressive not sol
much for his voice but for what I
he could do with it.
He tends to cover up a lack of [
resonance in fortissimo passages |
with vibrato, especially in the ex- i
treme registers, but between pin- I
nissimo and forte he has a pleasant:
and clean tone.
His program presented the cus- >
i tomary problems the recital tenor !
J is expected to negotiate, and he met I
i them with confidence, clear diction, j
and good command of dynamic.
The programming of the recital j
was on the familiar side, but. the |
high point was Hugo Wolf's rela
tively unfamiliar "Herr, was traegl
| der Boden hier."
Brahms' "Die Mainacht" was,
for me, (lie standout of the first
half of the program.
I should wish, perhaps, for Mr.
Olvis to include on future pro
! grams some of the songs of the |
j contemporary Britons Gerald |
Fin/.i and Peter Warlock, which
I he could handle admirably, cspc- ■
cially the latter'* sinister "The j
Fox" and bucolic "Mr. Belloc's
i Fancy"; works in this vein would
; have saved the concert from a ta- !
pering oil in quality imposed by
th cprogramming of the Hageman
works.
The accompaniment of Norma
Louise Brown was adequate, but
accompanied with a certain amouijt
j of gratuitous mannerisms: writhing
of wrists, raising of elbows, and the
1 "dying swan" gesture that I had
■ hoped went out with John Thomp
son's Piano Method.
