# BULL SESSION

### DICK MALTZMAN 
Boonwhip Q. Clod could have been (ho greatest
hurdler in Stanford history. He hud form and he had
.speed. The coaches drooled at the sight of the tanned
adonis in his BVD's. mailing over leetle hurdles and
beeg sticks.
"What grac•>■!!!" exclaimed Jack Weiershauser as he
cracked his first. smile in ten years.
"What a tride!!: exclaimed Kay Dean as he calmly

walked in front of a flying shot
put and disappeared from sight.
N "SOOPER -DOOPER," cried the
Dippy Sports Page.
"WOW! DOUBLE WOW" cried
Pete Grothe.
This boy has it, they all said;
hut little did they know/ Boon
wliip Q. Clod hurdled 1 i inch too
low. Me hurdled too low for the
lows and too low for the highs.
"He needs* work" said Coach

Weiershauser.
"Yes. said Coach Dean.
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!" said the Daily.
So Caosa> - worked. He took a string in traditional
fashion and he taped it in the doorway of his Toyon
room at the exact height of a high hurdle. When
ever he went in, whenever he went out, he hurdled
the string. He couldn't see a string without hurdling.
And he broke his habit of hurdling 1 i inch too low.
"i.'iok at him now!!!! said Coach Weiershauser.
"Great!! said Coach Dean.
FIRST WE'LL BEAT SC. THEN CAE, THEN OXY
—TODAY VVE RULE STANFORD. TOMORROW
THE WOULD!!!! said the Daily in a pessimistic
mood.
And I hen came the day of the big meet. It was Clod
against all the greatest hurdlers of the period.
When he walked over to th blocks with that con
fident air, the SC hurdlers shook with fear.

"He's our white hope for a victory," said Coach
Weiershauser.
"We stand a chance," said Coach Dean as a javelin
pierced his foot.
"WE'LE WIN IN A WALK!!!!" said the Daily.
Then a shot pierced the air. Ninety thousand spec
tators arose as one to see the much-heralded race.
Clod was the first one over the first hurdle. By the
second hurdle he was one hurdle in the lead. He
had a six hurdle edge on the rest of the field by the
seventh hurdle. He was nine hurdles ahead coming
over the last hurdle.
His time'll be good," said Coach Weiershauser.
"Might be a meet record," said Coach Dean.
"IT'LL BE A WORLD'S RECORD!!!!" burped the
Daily sports editor.
He was over the last hurdle . . .he was running for
the finish line . . .he was going to win — and then he
.saw it!!!! There in front of him was a string. In
stinctively his right leg went up. He was over the
finish line, but he hadn't broken the tape.
"Ulp!" said Coach Weiershauser. »
"Umphhh!" said Coach Dean as he impaled himself
on a pole vault.
"ETAOIN SHRDLU!!!!" groaned the Daily.
"You ain't allowed to win unless you break the
tape," said the SC graduate field judge.
And so the exploits of Boon whip Q. Clod can't >be
found in the record books. He was a failure. When he
heard the deoision of the field judge (whom the root
ing section accused of having a dubious ancestry), he
just kept on running—out of the stadium, out of the
University, out of the track world. And out of it
all, SC won the meet.
"Sigh!" said Coach Weiershauser.
"Sob," went Coach Dean.
"A MORAL VICTORY—WAIT UNTIL NEXT
YEAR!!!!!" said the Daily.
And so we wait.
