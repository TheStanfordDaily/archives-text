## Choosing Allies 
### 
To the Editor:
Mi - . James Ransom makes the following state
ments:
"Franco cannot take all credit for defeating Com
munism in Spain. He had plenty of help from a couple
of oth( r heroes. And among the three of them they
'succeeded in defeating a good deal more than Com
munism. Missing in action: Civil liberties, trade
unions . .We may have to accept him as we had
to accept an alliance with Fascist Russia against
Fascist Germany, Italy, and Japan."
Parallelism: We accepted some help from Fascist
Germany and Fascist Italy against Communism sup
ported by Fascist Russia and other democratic coun
tries. Or, does Mr. J. R. pretend that choosing allies
is America's privilege?
Democratic America had plenty of help from Fascist
Km -i,i and succeeded in defeating a great deal more
than . . .what'.' Fascism? Missing in action: Freedom

of Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithu
ania, Czechoslovakia, and so on.
As far as conditions for workingmen are concerned,
Mr. Ransom ignores that Franco's government is
doing more in their favor than any preceding demo
cratic government in Spain did before. Mr. Ransom
does no.t have to worry so much about the Spanish
people. They feel rather good under Franco's govern
ment as was proved by the voting in his favor of
83% of Spanish population on the referendum that
took place in the summer of 1947, following the pres
sure applied by the UNO.
As for basic humanitarian issues, in this atomic
age. we think this is a subject well left alone in
order not to make the controversy unpleasant.
