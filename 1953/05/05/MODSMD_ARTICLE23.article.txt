From the first Labor Day in
1920 to high pressure sales ol i
taqs marked "Tie One On lor
the Kiddies," Stanford's aclivi :
ties for (he benefit of its own
charity, the Convalescent
Home, have been varied and
colorful.
It wasn't until 1925 that Labor j
Day first coincided with the drive J
for funds. In 192 P. and '29 there first
appeared the activities by which
Con Home Week has been known
ever since the Masque Ball as a
Con Home benefit, the tags, the
posters, the benefit shows.
Sirens sounded to announce the
end of classes for the day and the
bej l inning of work at the Con Home.
The I!>2I Daily announced that
one tree, several stumps, 1.000,047
weeds, IX dicep. and 50 gallons
of ice cream awaited the Labor
Dny laborers. The day with its
attendant barbecue hasn't changed
much over the years.
Stanford student must have felt
the df pre: ion. according to the plea
that the chairman of the 1932 drive |
made. "Students absolutely
to contribute will not be driven in
any way. he said, but he urged ev- j
eryone who was able to give up
some little luxury and give the

money to the drive.
The jolly-up after Labor Day had
a "Below Depression" theme. In
: pite of the depression, however, the
financial results of the drive were
good.
It was that same year that the
Daily reported that some of the "la
boring" students climbed trees and
played Tarzan all day at the Home.
"Only a war correspondent could
describe it," they concluded.
The Soph Carnival became part
of Con Home Week in 1936, the
' Y" Strawberry Brunch in 19:54.
Both had been held previously,
but for other purposes than rais
ing money for the convalescent
kiddies.
Perhaps the height of Strawberry
Brunch publicity was reached in
1939 when the Main Libe fountain
was converted into a papier-mache
shortcake. Corp Yard employees
tore it down by mistake, but it was
repaired in time.
The captain of the baseball team
started the idea of Bean Day in 1933.
All the residences, as well as the
Union dining room, served beans
instead of the regular meals, and
contributed the difference in cost to
the Home. "Beans for Babies, Base
ball Players for Beans" was his slo
gan.
The next year Bean Day was
combined with the Strawberry
Brunch, everyone figuring that the
two activities would boost each oth
er. Merchants contributed the lima,
kidney, and navy beans, releasing a
little more money for the Home.
During Labor Day in 1935, stu
dents were particularly requested
to stay out of the llome huilditifrs

! The authorities were fearful of a
measles epidemic then raging on
campus.
Blank checks, made out to -the
Con Home lor 1 the sum of $2.56, slo
ganed "Give a Day of Happiness,"
and needing only the student's sig
nature, were handed out in 1940. A
day in the Con Home cost $2.56
that year, but the price rose with
inflationary rapidity: $2.61 in 1941,
$2.73 in 1944.
The war meant little change in
I Con Home Week activity. To be
i sure, the barbecues were called off,
j and apparently beans were hard to
get; the chairman for Bean Day
promised "something equally hor
rible" for the hungry students,
however. Strawberry Brunch be
came Strawberry Punch when it
became more difficult to obtain
j shortcake materials.
The Masque Ball King and
j Queen contests were, of course,
called off after the 1936 campaign,
but the next year a kin/? and
queen were cliosen by the lucky
number on a Ball ticket. In 1911
there was a different kind of con
test. Each house sponsored a Con
home lH»y or girl for king or
queen, and tried to elect their
candidate with their pennies.
And then the Chappie put out a
special issue for Con Home Week
in 1940, putting it on the stands a
week early for that purpose. One
might question their seriousness of
purpose, however, on learning that
one of the articles therein was en
titled "Gee, I Hate Little Children."
Every drive has proved, however,
that no Stanford student hates little
children

Both had been held previously,
but for other purposes than rais
ing money for the convalescent
kiddies.
Perhaps the height of Strawberry
Brunch publicity was reached in
1939 when the Main Libe fountain
was converted into a papier-mache
shortcake. Corp Yard employees
tore it down by mistake, but it was
repaired in time.
The captain of the baseball team
started the idea of Bean Day in 1933.
All the residences, as well as the
Union dining room, served beans
instead of the regular meals, and
contributed the difference in cost to
the Home. "Beans for Babies, Base
ball Players for Beans" was his slo
gan.
The next year Bean Day was
combined with the Strawberry
Brunch, everyone figuring that the
two activities would boost each oth
er. Merchants contributed the lima,
kidney, and navy beans, releasing a
little more money for the Home.
During Labor Day in 1935, stu
dents were particularly requested
to stay out of the llome huilditifrs

! The authorities were fearful of a
measles epidemic then raging on
campus.
Blank checks, made out to -the
Con Home lor 1 the sum of $2.56, slo
ganed "Give a Day of Happiness,"
and needing only the student's sig
nature, were handed out in 1940. A
day in the Con Home cost $2.56
that year, but the price rose with
inflationary rapidity: $2.61 in 1941,
$2.73 in 1944.
The war meant little change in
I Con Home Week activity. To be
i sure, the barbecues were called off,
j and apparently beans were hard to
get; the chairman for Bean Day
promised "something equally hor
rible" for the hungry students,
however. Strawberry Brunch be
came Strawberry Punch when it
became more difficult to obtain
j shortcake materials.
The Masque Ball King and
j Queen contests were, of course,
called off after the 1936 campaign,
but the next year a kin/? and
queen were cliosen by the lucky
number on a Ball ticket. In 1911
there was a different kind of con
test. Each house sponsored a Con
home lH»y or girl for king or
queen, and tried to elect their
candidate with their pennies.
And then the Chappie put out a
special issue for Con Home Week
in 1940, putting it on the stands a

might question their seriousness of
purpose, however, on learning that

titled "Gee, I Hate Little Children."
Every drive has proved, however,
that no Stanford student hates little

It wasn't until 1925 that Labor j

for funds. In 192 P. and '29 there first
appeared the activities by which
Con Home Week has been known
ever since the Masque Ball as a
Con Home benefit, the tags, the
posters, the benefit shows.
Sirens sounded to announce the
end of classes for the day and the
bej l inning of work at the Con Home.
The I!>2I Daily announced that
one tree, several stumps, 1.000,047
weeds, IX dicep. and 50 gallons
of ice cream awaited the Labor
Dny laborers. The day with its
attendant barbecue hasn't changed
much over the years.
Stanford student must have felt

made. "Students absolutely
to contribute will not be driven in
any way. he said, but he urged ev- j
eryone who was able to give up
some little luxury and give the

money to the drive.
The jolly-up after Labor Day had
a "Below Depression" theme. In
: pite of the depression, however, the
financial results of the drive were

It was that same year that the
