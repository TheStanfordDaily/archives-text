# Stanford Janitor Turns Song Writer

### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
A jack-of-all-trades in the lit
erary world is Charles McNa
ven, a 56-year-old Stanford jani
tor.
McNaven's latest effort has
been an orchestral work entitled
"The Mother Lode," which is
scheduled to be performed May
22 at Lincoln, Calif., by the Ap
plegate Symphony Orchestra,
at the Applegate Bowl summer
concerts, and at Nevada City
summer concerts.
"Having never written a song be
fore," reminisced McNaven, "I was
rather startled when Henry van der
Graf, conductor of the Applegate
orchestra, asked me to compose
one. As I recall, the conversation
went somewhat like this:
" 'Write me a song.'
" 'But I've never written one.'
"'Write one anyway.'"
The actual writing of the song
was a snap, McNaven recalls, taking
only about 10 minutes. In trying to
sell it, he followed the policy of
contacting local groups, like the
Native Daughters of the Golden
West.
Other fields of literary endeavor
have also been followed by McNa
ven. He has written for News-Let
ter and Wasp Magazine, and several
articles for Motion Pictures Maga
zine. Interviews with Andy Devine,
Nelson Eddy, Boris Karloff, and
James Cagney have been published
by the latter publication.
McNaven has also worked as a
Reporter on the Bakersfield Califor
nian, handling the oil column news.
"The theater is my real love,"
said McNaven enthusiastically.
"I've never missed a performance
of a Stanford production."
His big ambition in life, he con
fided, is to write stage plays. "Two
of our most talented playwrights
(Tennessee Williams and Arthur

Miller) write of the frustrations and
miseries in life. I don't feel that
life is quite that hopeless and will
try to bring out in my future writ
ing of plays the fact that there can
be a brighter side of our lives if we
look deep enough within ourselves."
Part of McNaven's optimism
about life comes, he says, from
working with Stanford students,
whom he characterizes as being
courteous and friendly.
"I always like to remember this
incident," he recalls. "Two young
men students had their bags packed
and were leaving for the Christmas
holidays. I wished them merry
Christmas and asked them how long
it would be before they would know
if they passed their examinations.
"One of them said. 'Come, come,
my good man. You don't mean
when will we know if we passed,
you mean when will we know if
we got all A's.'"
"With a youthful attitude like
that, we can afford to be optimistic
about the future of our country,"
McNaven said.
