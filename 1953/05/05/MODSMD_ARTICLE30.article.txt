## Nick, Phil, and Jake 
### 
Nick, Phil, and Jake are a trio on the Farm who have played a tremendous
part in every individual athlete, and yet their deeds, which often take on
heroic proportions, are seldom acknowledged unless of course they
should err.
This team of Jake Irwin,' Nick Shulgin, and Phil Phillips is in charge
of iust about everything that goes on in the Stanford gym. lhcir most
important task being to keep the athletes in uniform, both practice gear
and game suits. They also run the gym store, issue lockers and in general
are the men directly behind the athletes and the men who use the Stan
ford gym.
II you ask them they will reply in unison that the toughest part of
the year for them is fall, followed closely by the spring.
"In the fall we care for some 400 athletes, most of them football players,
varsity, JV, and frosh. Then there is basketball, soccer, and a few other
sports. The laundry problem is real tough as heavy football gear requires
more changes per week th;in the lighter practice togs that are used in
spring sports. We care for as many men in the spring, but the laundry
problem is not so severe. That is, with the exception of the three weeks ol
spring football."
Phil has been catering to the students since 1926, Jake since '27. Nick's
the newcomer, being in service only five years.
They are a team themselves. They have seen the stars comg and go.
they have fitted uniforms to the big men and the small, they have sifted
jerseys and equipment from their vast stores to meet every need.
And their stories are many. Nick will tell you how. on game days, you
can tell the athletes who are nervous, by their actions in getting their
uniform issue. And it's Phil, who like a mother hovering about her kids,
checks each player, and ties loose straps and helps the boys who are
inexperienced with strange equipment.
Jake will recall how Frankie Albert came to Stanford back in '38 and
was hesitant to wear any other jersey than number 13 which was not
in stock, as manufacturers left it out <il orders intentionally because of
the superstition attached. So Frankie sat out the first two weeks awaiting
the arrival of special >crscy 13. Today 1.1 is regularly carried in the sets
of new ierseys which Stanford gets each year. Jerseys which numhei
sometimes around 180 in a single season.
And Jake will go on to add that on the Farm number 12 seems to be
the jinx number and the one to which injuries are attracted.
The trio agrees that the athletes who are the real stars are the ones
who cause the least trouble. They are not the prima donnas. Some of
the men who don't play regularly go as far as putting the blame on their
their equipment. Of course, on game days hardly anything seems to fit
anyone.
Football is the sport that requires the most work as far as correctly
lilting pads and suits. And it's in football that the players are the most
finicky and justifiably so, because a misfitting pad can lead to easy in
jury.
Basketballers are the men with the biggest leet, or at least on the
average, though, "all feet seem to be growing bigger." Phil adds, recalling
the size 14 shoes some footballer once needed.
There are other problems besides just handling equipment. Stanford
has a gym store, owned by the Board ot Athletic Control, which carries
all types of men's basic clothing items. And the store does a total business
of about $40,000 a year. Jake is in charge of that. When he took it over in
1931), it was making about $1,300. But Jake was smart enough to put in
Stanford jackets, which almost every freshman buys his first week in
school.
Another problem is the lockers. Each Stanford male student has a locker.
Nick is in charge of this department. Forgotten combinations and lockers
that won't open are an every day occurrence.
But the biggest concern is leaving the lockers open and having wallets
and valuable articles stolen. This is particularly most prevalent on game
days when excitement replaces caution.
Of course there is the "removing" among the athletes themselves of
inexpensive athletic gear just to have an article stamped SU. The mor
tality rate among football T shirts and sweatshirts is extremely high and
such garments marked with a large SU are seen on Quad anywhere, any
time.
Another beef which really has Jake in a turmoil these days is the one
between the cleaning establishments and the uniform manufacturers. And
Jake gets caught right in the middle with shrunken, frayed uniforms.
The cleaning houses claim that the manufacturers' new material, nylon,
rayon, etc., is poor and any damage clone is not the fault of the cleaner.
On the other hand, the manufacturers say the cleaners and their new
detergents are the cause.
Jake believes it's the detergents, as lie will send out the same old sweat
shirts to the cleaners, ones that have not changed in material in years
and they come back suitable for a size 38. not 44. while a year ago the
same sweatshirt that went out a 44 came hack a 44.
That's briefly the story of Jake, Nick, and Phil who are the men behind
every male that uses the Stanford gym. This is the trio which quickly
-voices admiration of each other and all but shouts praise <<112 the boys they
serve, exclaiming, "What a bunch of great kids they are to work with."

Phil has been catering to the students since 1926, Jake since '27. Nick's
the newcomer, being in service only five years.
They are a team themselves. They have seen the stars comg and go.
they have fitted uniforms to the big men and the small, they have sifted
jerseys and equipment from their vast stores to meet every need.
And their stories are many. Nick will tell you how. on game days, you
can tell the athletes who are nervous, by their actions in getting their
uniform issue. And it's Phil, who like a mother hovering about her kids,
checks each player, and ties loose straps and helps the boys who are
inexperienced with strange equipment.
Jake will recall how Frankie Albert came to Stanford back in '38 and
was hesitant to wear any other jersey than number 13 which was not
in stock, as manufacturers left it out <il orders intentionally because of
the superstition attached. So Frankie sat out the first two weeks awaiting
the arrival of special >crscy 13. Today 1.1 is regularly carried in the sets
of new ierseys which Stanford gets each year. Jerseys which numhei
sometimes around 180 in a single season.
And Jake will go on to add that on the Farm number 12 seems to be
the jinx number and the one to which injuries are attracted.
The trio agrees that the athletes who are the real stars are the ones
who cause the least trouble. They are not the prima donnas. Some of
the men who don't play regularly go as far as putting the blame on their
their equipment. Of course, on game days hardly anything seems to fit
anyone.
Football is the sport that requires the most work as far as correctly
lilting pads and suits. And it's in football that the players are the most
finicky and justifiably so, because a misfitting pad can lead to easy in
jury.
Basketballers are the men with the biggest leet, or at least on the
average, though, "all feet seem to be growing bigger." Phil adds, recalling
the size 14 shoes some footballer once needed.
There are other problems besides just handling equipment. Stanford
has a gym store, owned by the Board ot Athletic Control, which carries
all types of men's basic clothing items. And the store does a total business
of about $40,000 a year. Jake is in charge of that. When he took it over in
1931), it was making about $1,300. But Jake was smart enough to put in
Stanford jackets, which almost every freshman buys his first week in
school.
Another problem is the lockers. Each Stanford male student has a locker.
Nick is in charge of this department. Forgotten combinations and lockers
that won't open are an every day occurrence.
But the biggest concern is leaving the lockers open and having wallets
and valuable articles stolen. This is particularly most prevalent on game
days when excitement replaces caution.
Of course there is the "removing" among the athletes themselves of
inexpensive athletic gear just to have an article stamped SU. The mor
tality rate among football T shirts and sweatshirts is extremely high and
such garments marked with a large SU are seen on Quad anywhere, any
time.
Another beef which really has Jake in a turmoil these days is the one
between the cleaning establishments and the uniform manufacturers. And
Jake gets caught right in the middle with shrunken, frayed uniforms.
The cleaning houses claim that the manufacturers' new material, nylon,
rayon, etc., is poor and any damage clone is not the fault of the cleaner.
On the other hand, the manufacturers say the cleaners and their new
detergents are the cause.
Jake believes it's the detergents, as lie will send out the same old sweat
shirts to the cleaners, ones that have not changed in material in years
and they come back suitable for a size 38. not 44. while a year ago the
same sweatshirt that went out a 44 came hack a 44.
That's briefly the story of Jake, Nick, and Phil who are the men behind
every male that uses the Stanford gym. This is the trio which quickly
-voices admiration of each other and all but shouts praise <<112 the boys they
serve, exclaiming, "What a bunch of great kids they are to work with."
Nick, Phil, and Jake are a trio on the Farm who have played a tremendous
part in every individual athlete, and yet their deeds, which often take on
heroic proportions, are seldom acknowledged unless of course they
should err.
This team of Jake Irwin,' Nick Shulgin, and Phil Phillips is in charge
of iust about everything that goes on in the Stanford gym. lhcir most
important task being to keep the athletes in uniform, both practice gear
and game suits. They also run the gym store, issue lockers and in general
are the men directly behind the athletes and the men who use the Stan
ford gym.
II you ask them they will reply in unison that the toughest part of
the year for them is fall, followed closely by the spring.
"In the fall we care for some 400 athletes, most of them football players,
varsity, JV, and frosh. Then there is basketball, soccer, and a few other
sports. The laundry problem is real tough as heavy football gear requires
more changes per week th;in the lighter practice togs that are used in
spring sports. We care for as many men in the spring, but the laundry
problem is not so severe. That is, with the exception of the three weeks ol
spring football."

And Jake will go on to add that on the Farm number 12 seems to be
the jinx number and the one to which injuries are attracted.
The trio agrees that the athletes who are the real stars are the ones
who cause the least trouble. They are not the prima donnas. Some of
the men who don't play regularly go as far as putting the blame on their
their equipment. Of course, on game days hardly anything seems to fit
anyone.
Football is the sport that requires the most work as far as correctly
lilting pads and suits. And it's in football that the players are the most
finicky and justifiably so, because a misfitting pad can lead to easy in
jury.
Basketballers are the men with the biggest leet, or at least on the
average, though, "all feet seem to be growing bigger." Phil adds, recalling
the size 14 shoes some footballer once needed.
There are other problems besides just handling equipment. Stanford
has a gym store, owned by the Board ot Athletic Control, which carries
all types of men's basic clothing items. And the store does a total business
of about $40,000 a year. Jake is in charge of that. When he took it over in
1931), it was making about $1,300. But Jake was smart enough to put in
Stanford jackets, which almost every freshman buys his first week in
school.
Another problem is the lockers. Each Stanford male student has a locker.
Nick is in charge of this department. Forgotten combinations and lockers
that won't open are an every day occurrence.
But the biggest concern is leaving the lockers open and having wallets
and valuable articles stolen. This is particularly most prevalent on game
days when excitement replaces caution.
Of course there is the "removing" among the athletes themselves of
inexpensive athletic gear just to have an article stamped SU. The mor
tality rate among football T shirts and sweatshirts is extremely high and
such garments marked with a large SU are seen on Quad anywhere, any
time.
Another beef which really has Jake in a turmoil these days is the one
between the cleaning establishments and the uniform manufacturers. And
Jake gets caught right in the middle with shrunken, frayed uniforms.
The cleaning houses claim that the manufacturers' new material, nylon,
rayon, etc., is poor and any damage clone is not the fault of the cleaner.
On the other hand, the manufacturers say the cleaners and their new
detergents are the cause.
Jake believes it's the detergents, as lie will send out the same old sweat
shirts to the cleaners, ones that have not changed in material in years
and they come back suitable for a size 38. not 44. while a year ago the
same sweatshirt that went out a 44 came hack a 44.
That's briefly the story of Jake, Nick, and Phil who are the men behind
every male that uses the Stanford gym. This is the trio which quickly
-voices admiration of each other and all but shouts praise <<112 the boys they
serve, exclaiming, "What a bunch of great kids they are to work with."
