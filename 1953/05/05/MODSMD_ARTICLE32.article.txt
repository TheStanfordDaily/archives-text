# Hamilton Field Going to Yield?
## 
### 
Stanford's baseballers will
meet an unknown Hamilton
Field club today at 3:15 on the
Sunken Diamond.
Coach Everett Dean nomi
nated hot-and-cold Don DeLong
io face the fliers. Ken Brown
and Mike Acker will spell him.
The usual batting order of Scra
maglia, Goodrich, Talboy, Shepard,
Essegian, Swarts, Cole, Hennacy,
and the pitchers will open the game,
but if the expected rout develops,
Dean may clear the bench.
Coach Everett Dean, ever the
pe :itnist, in Evaluating Stanford's
weekend split with UCLA, pointed
out that Cal still had a minute
chance against the Cards. Stanford
meets the Bears three more times
and will probably have to win one
to clinch the Hag.
Two of the games are at Berkeley,
which might make it rough on the
Cards, but with Bob Murphy wow
ing everyone from Governor War
fen down to Mike Hudson with his
spectacular pitching, the Cards ap
pear to be a cinch for their second
CIBA title in four years.
This weekend the Cards will face
Santa Clara on Friday and then Cal
at Berkeley on Saturday.


BEST IN THE WEST—Jack Shepard continues powering the ball
at a sensational clip. He is hitting at a .393 pace and his 48 hits
this season include six doubles, nine triples and four homers.
Shepard is optimistic about the team's chances to garner the
CIBA crown and a few national honors. "If we take it a step at
a time, and play up to our potential, we should go all the way."
