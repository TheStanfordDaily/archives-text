TOO LATE—Despite a speedy five and a half mile dash, two crews from the Stanford fire de
partment arrived too late last night to save this vacant two room shed on the Webb Ranch off
Alpine Road. Three Stanford firemen are shown spraying water on the blazing embers. Two
trucks from the San Mateo County fire station at Belmont also responded to the alarm which
was first sounded at about 7:15. —Daily photo by Glenn Erickson
