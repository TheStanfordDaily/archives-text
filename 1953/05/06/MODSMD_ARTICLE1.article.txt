Associate Editor, The Daily
Stanford senior Charles Leon
ard Meyer died yesterday be
neath the surface of Lake Lag
unita, the apparent victim of
asphyxiation.
Meyer had been swimming under
water with an aqualung, an oxygen
supplying device, when his oxygen
supply failed.
Cause of the tragic failure has
not yet been determined. Police say

| that when Meyer's body was brought
tto tlie surface the oxygen flow lever
was turned off.
Campus Police Chief Gordon
Davis offered this explanation of
' the bizarre accident:
That Meyer became confused
| under water and, in an attempt to
| increase thr amount of oxygen
Mowing into his mask, accidentally
turned off the vital gas.
It is estimated that Meyer had
lain at the bottom of the lake at
least 15 minutes before he was found
by his roommate, Stirling H. Pierce,
and life gyard John Flynri.

Meyer was. found and dragged
ashore at 2:55 and was pronounced
dead at 4:16 p.m.
During the hour and 20 min
ute rescue attempt, firemen and
doctors tried to stir a response in
the prostrate swimmer.
Six cylinders of oxygen plus
adrenalin, a powerful stimulant,
were administered.
Dr. Robert North of the Stanford
Health Service, who attended Meyer,
said death was apparently caused
by asphyxiation, a lack of air, and
not by drowning as was first sup
posed. No water was found in his
lungs, the doctor said.
An autopsy will be held within
the week by the Santa Clara Coun
ty coroner to determine officially
the cause of death.
The death sccnc was enacted in
part on the landing at the Boat
House as grim faced students gath
ered around.
After twenty minutes or so of
futile effort at the Boat House, Meyer
was taken to the Palo Alto Hospital
by ambulance.
Meyer's absence along the lake
was first noticed by Pierce who had
swum to the middle of the lake,
leaving his roommate near the land
ing testing the aqualung.
Picrcc gives this account of the
unusual tragedy:
"When I returned from the mid
dle of the lake I noticed that Len
nic was gone. I checked the plat
form and when I didn't see him I
dove under the surface. I found
him on the bottom a little under
the landing. I then called the life
guards to help me."
Yesterday was the first time that
Meyer had tried underwater swim
ming with the diving apparatus.
The aqualung belonged to Pierce
who said that he had used the de
vice several times and had always
found it in good working order.
A preliminary check by police
at the sccnc revealed that it con
tained sufficient oxygen for a nor
mal underwater swim.
The aqualung is being forwarded
to the Santa Clara sheriff's labora
tory for a more thorough check.
Picrcc said he thought Meyer was
well" acquainted with the use of the
aqualung.
Meyer lived with Pierce at 955 Fre
mont Avenue in Mcnlo Park. Meyer
was 21 years old, a political science
major and a member of the Stanford
ski club.
He is survived by his parents, Mr.
and Mrs. Roland Meyer, a brother
Fred, all of i) 8 Austin Avenue, Athcr
ton.
