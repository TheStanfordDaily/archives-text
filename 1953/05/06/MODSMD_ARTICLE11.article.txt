# Stanford's Sam McDonald Says He's 'Richest Man in the World'
## THIS MORNING'S HEADLINES 
### Barbara Tuerk 
Sam McDonald thinks he's the
"richest person in the country."
"Why?
"Because other people lose
their children when they grow
up, but my children come in an
inexhaustible series. I have new
children every year. And their
children and grandchildren are
my children, too."
He's riglit, too.
Since 100'i Sam lias been father
and friend to every member of the
Stanford family — from the presi
dents, David Starr Jordan, .John
Casper Branner, and Ray Lyman
Wilbur, down to the littlest children
at the Con Home.
Officially Sam is University Su
perintendent of Athletic Buildings
and Grounds.
[Jut unofficially lie's far more,
lie's favorite story-teller at Ihe
Con Home, most popular barbe
cue chef on campus (he'll be bar
becuing at the Con Home to
night), and family friend to the
hundreds of students and alumni
who visit him at bis office or his
La llonda home each year.
Sam has no favorites among his

| huge family, but lie admits to a
i mighty soft spot for the Con Home
kids. "Going over there all the
time, seeing how they come in in
such bad shape and gradually how
| they get well, after a while it gets
I you," he says. "How wonderful it
is!"
Sam gets out to Ihe Con Home
to see the children a couple of
times a week, helps ou( with their
scouting activities, and goes In all
i (heir holiday parties.
He loves to tell how the children
I goggled at the prize-winning Vic-
I tory Garden he started out there
' during the war. "The children did
n't know how seeds were planted
before wo .started," lie laughs. "We
let them plant corn and watermel
on, and every day they'd ask, 'Are
the watermelons up yet?' "
Sam barbecued for the first Labor
Day back in 1922 just as he has bar
becued for every Labor Day since
and will be barbecuing tonight. The
menu will feature steaks tonight,
but in 1922 it was lamb—sheep that
lived right on the campus and kept
the grass cropped.
""Sam's animated lawnmower,'
they used to call them," he re
members.
As a matter of fact, Sam remem
bers lots of incidents from the Stan

ford past. His careful handwriting
now covers 1,306 pages of the worn
notebook which contains "Sam
McDonald's Stanford Story," the
memoirs friends persuaded him to
start a few years ago.
His book will cover 50 years of
Stanford life, from the time he lirst
came here as a teamster in 1.903 up
until the end of this spring. He
hopes to have it ready for publica
tion within the year.
"I feci like an author now," he
laughs. "It just sort of grows on
you. Lois of nights I don't even
go to bed, just work all night with
m,y legs propped up on my desk."
"You know,"he says again and
again. "I'm just so happy. And T
never felt, better in my life. I think
maybe it's doing the book that
keeps me busy and happy."
Maybe, Sam.
But isn't it maybe because of
the smiling faces of Con Home
children waving al you, "Hi,
Sain!"?
And isn't it maybe because of the
hundreds of friends coming back to
visit you again each year?
And isn't it maybe because year
after year you've been a real in
spiration to the people you love
most?
We think maybe it is.

Day back in 1922 just as he has bar
becued for every Labor Day since
and will be barbecuing tonight. The
menu will feature steaks tonight,
but in 1922 it was lamb—sheep that
lived right on the campus and kept
the grass cropped.
""Sam's animated lawnmower,'
they used to call them," he re
members.
As a matter of fact, Sam remem
bers lots of incidents from the Stan

ford past. His careful handwriting
now covers 1,306 pages of the worn
notebook which contains "Sam
McDonald's Stanford Story," the
memoirs friends persuaded him to
start a few years ago.
His book will cover 50 years of
Stanford life, from the time he lirst
came here as a teamster in 1.903 up
until the end of this spring. He
hopes to have it ready for publica
tion within the year.
"I feci like an author now," he
laughs. "It just sort of grows on
you. Lois of nights I don't even
go to bed, just work all night with
m,y legs propped up on my desk."
"You know,"he says again and
again. "I'm just so happy. And T
never felt, better in my life. I think
maybe it's doing the book that
keeps me busy and happy."
Maybe, Sam.
But isn't it maybe because of
the smiling faces of Con Home
children waving al you, "Hi,
Sain!"?
And isn't it maybe because of the
hundreds of friends coming back to
visit you again each year?
And isn't it maybe because year
after year you've been a real in
spiration to the people you love
most?
We think maybe it is.
Sam McDonald thinks he's the
"richest person in the country."
"Why?
"Because other people lose
their children when they grow
up, but my children come in an
inexhaustible series. I have new
children every year. And their
children and grandchildren are
my children, too."
He's riglit, too.
Since 100'i Sam lias been father
and friend to every member of the
Stanford family — from the presi
dents, David Starr Jordan, .John
Casper Branner, and Ray Lyman
Wilbur, down to the littlest children
at the Con Home.
Officially Sam is University Su
perintendent of Athletic Buildings
and Grounds.
[Jut unofficially lie's far more,
lie's favorite story-teller at Ihe
Con Home, most popular barbe
cue chef on campus (he'll be bar
becuing at the Con Home to
night), and family friend to the
hundreds of students and alumni
who visit him at bis office or his
La llonda home each year.
Sam has no favorites among his

| huge family, but lie admits to a
i mighty soft spot for the Con Home
kids. "Going over there all the
time, seeing how they come in in
such bad shape and gradually how
| they get well, after a while it gets
I you," he says. "How wonderful it
is!"
Sam gets out to Ihe Con Home
to see the children a couple of
times a week, helps ou( with their
scouting activities, and goes In all
i (heir holiday parties.
He loves to tell how the children
I goggled at the prize-winning Vic-
I tory Garden he started out there
' during the war. "The children did
n't know how seeds were planted
before wo .started," lie laughs. "We
let them plant corn and watermel
on, and every day they'd ask, 'Are
the watermelons up yet?' "
