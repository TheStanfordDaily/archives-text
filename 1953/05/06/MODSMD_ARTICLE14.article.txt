# Clean-up Day Set for May 9
## 
### 
Saturday has been chosen as
Clean-up Day for fraternities and
living groups.
All trash collected may be put in
the garbage areas behind the vari
ous houses, and will be collected by
a free truck service provided by the
Corp Yard.
The drive has two aimsâ€”to elim
inate fire hazards that exist in clos
ets and attics, and to destroy breed
ing places for mice and mosquitoes.
It has been suggested that the
bouse managers organize the day
in their houses.
