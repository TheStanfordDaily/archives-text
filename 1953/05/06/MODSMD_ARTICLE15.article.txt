# Tidelands Oil Bill Is Passed by U.S. Senate
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 5 (UP) -
The Senate finally passed the
hotly-disputed "Tidelands" bill
today after one of the longest
and loudest legislative battles
in congressional history.
Finfil approval came by voice vote
after the bill had tentatively passed
on a 5G to .'55 roll call ballot. The
tentative vote line-up was 35 Re
publicans and 21 Democrats for the
bill; 25 Democrats. 9 Republicans,
and independent Wayne Morse of
Oregon opposed.
The bill, similar to one already
passed by the House, overturns re
cent Supreme Court rulings and
gives coastal states clear title to the
ocean floor out to their historic sea
ward boundaries. This is lOV2 miles
ofT Texas and West Florida and
three miles elsewhere.
The bill now goes to a conference
committee to reconcile differences

with the House version. The House
measure provided for federal devel
opment of resources on the conti
nental shelf past the state bound
aries. The Senate elected to deal
with that provision in a separate bill
expcctcd in about two weeks.
Congress has passed tidelands
bills twice before but former Presi
dent Truman vetoed both. Presi
dent Eisenhower promised in last
year's political campaign that he
would sign this one.
