TOKYO. Wednesday, May fi-Thc
Allies accused the Communists to
day of hiding, behind a "negotiating
smokescreen," an unbending intent
to drive unwilling war prisoners
home at bayonet point.
Lt. Gen. William K. Harrison said
he saw no sign that the Reds really
wanted an armistice or were nego

liatint,' in good faith.
The talks still were deadlocked
on the questions of what neutral
nation will handle Red prisoners
who refuse to co home and whether
the prisoners will be sent to the
neutral nation or remain in Korea
under neutral custody.
The Communists requested a 40-
minute recess after 14 minutes of
today's truce meeting, and the Unit
ed Nations agreed.
