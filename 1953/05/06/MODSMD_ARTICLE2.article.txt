## Nashashibi Voices Plea For Israel Arabs' Rights 
### 
A strong plea for Arab rights was sounded here last night at
the Tuesday Evening lecture by Anwar Nashashibi, a spokes
man for the Arabs of Israel.
He flatly charged that America enjoys little but ill-feeling in
the Middle East.
Reason for this, he said, is America's past support of Zionist

interests in the area.
He spoke passionately of the
Arabs' hope of independence.
And he complained that follow
ing World War I, the United States
brushed aside its promises of self
determination and favored Jewish
claims.
lie said that Arab hopes for in
dependence wore particularly
raised at the end of World War I
when the Ottoman Empire was
crushed.
But, he said, the Arabs found a
new tyrant in Great Britain, which
claimed the Arab region as a sphere
of influence.
The British, he claimed, were
particularly conccrned with the es
tablishment of a Zionist state. And
when the British faltered, lie added,
the Americans exerted pressure.
Culmination of Zionist effort
came, he said, following World
War II when an Anglo-American
commission recommended the en
try of 100,000 Jews into Palestine.
Other recommendations were that
a permanent Zionist state be set up
and that land regulations be abro
gated.
Following the approval of these
recommendations by President Tru
man, they were put before the
United Nations, Nashashibi claimed.
In the United Nations, he charged
further, the United Nations domi
nated the discussion on the partition
of Palestine, constantly on the side
of the Zionists.
These discussions eventually led
to a partition which was grossly un
fair to Arab interests, lie claimed.
Nashashibi pointed out that mil
lions of Arabs were made homeless
and that acres of property were
confiscated.
The Point Four program and cap
ital arc not. sufficient, he said.
