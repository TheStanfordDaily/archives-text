# Dress Up the Place
## 
### 
It's high time that Stanford woke up to the
fact that the campus is a top-notch attraction.
The Hoover Tower is one of the outstanding
landmarks in the Bay Area.
The beautiful Memorial Church is also wide
ly known.
There are numerous other spots on the cam
pus which either are or could be thoroughly in
viting to visitors.
The Stanford campus is featured on commer
cial tours of the Peninsula. It is visited by alum
ni who want to see "how the old school looks."
Jt is visited by parents, thinking of sending
their offspring here as students.
In short, the Farm is a veritable Mecca to
tourists who are all prospective donors or pros
pective students.
The University has staked a claim on this
mine for good public relations, but blithely ig
nores the rich vein latent in it.
There is a poorly-paid, understaffed guide

and information service. This second-class
service only emphasizes the take-it-or-leave-it
impression given visitors.
Let's dress up the show a bit.
Brush the cobwebs from the Stanford Mu
seum and open it to the public. Plant a bit of
year-around greenery along Palm Drive, so that
cars arriving in summer don't get the appear
ance of driving through the Oklahoma dust
bowl.
Spruce up the guide service so that visitors'
curiosity for poking into interesting places and
finding out interesting information will be sa
tiated and not merely pigued.
As long as Stanford is getting off the ground
in its drive for new funds, for outstanding stu
dents and faculty, it might as well explore
every logical avenue.
It costs only a little more to go first class.
The dividends would be well worth the in l
vestment.
