# PERMANENT FILES STARTED
## Placement Service Will Help Seniors With Post-Graduate Employment Blues 
### 
By MARGARET DALGLIESH
Nothing worries a graduating
senior more than the prospect of
tramping the streets, diploma in
hand, looking for a job. Inter
views and applications, indeci
sion and frustration await him—
a dismal prospect after four care
free years in college.
For Stanford students, worry and
doubt are unnecessary. The Place
ment Service on Inner Quad is
ready to file job applications, ar
range interviews, and seek employ
ment for any student or graduate.
At the present time the Place
ment Service is urging seniors to
register with them even if they
a'en'l looking for a job, so that
their records will he on file for
future reference.
To register at the Placement
Service, a student should make an
appointment with Richard O'Brien.
After the interview, it is up to the
indent to till his file with letters of
recommendation from past employ
ers and professors. Seven photo
graphs should also be submitted, to
use in placements conducted by
mail.
All this information is compiled
into a portfolio which can be sent

to employers upon request.
Many students have the idea
that employers aren't interested in
men who will be drafted within
the next few months. They are
wrong. Employers are always in
terested in interviewing prospec
tive employees. Outstanding pros

pects will often he given a job for
a month or two, and can enter the
Army with the assurance of a po
sition when they return.
While a man is in the service his
file is placed on an inactive list at
the Placement Service. More infor
mation may be added at any time.
The Army offers a good oppor
tunity to collect letters of recom
mendation. It i.s usually easy to get
a letter from a commanding officer
j when you are stationed with him,
although difficult after leaving the
j service.
Six months before his release a
j man may write the Placement
Service and his file will be reacti
vated. lie will be notified of jobs
available while he is in the serv
| ice.
The Placement Service may be
used any time after graduation and
may be used as many times as is
necessary.
This year 250 graduating seniors
have found positions through the
J Placement Service, Jobs await many
| others for the asking.
For those who plan to loaf or who
have jobs waiting for them after
graduation, a file at £he Placement
Service is still a good idea. It might
mean the difference between work
|or unemployment 10 years from
1 now.
