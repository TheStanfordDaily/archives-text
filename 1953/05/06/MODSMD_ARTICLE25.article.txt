# Sky's the Limit for Members Of Stanford's 'Flying Indians'
## 
### PAT KING 
The sky's the limit for a group of energetic Stanford students
who prefer not to have their feet on the ground.
As members of the newly-organized "Indian Flyers," they fore
go sunny afternoons at Lake Lag in favor of weather charts, trans
mitters, and landing gears.

j j
Twenty-three out of the 33 mem
bers are fall-fledged pilots and are
eligible to fly planes from the Palo
Alto Airport at reduced rates. The
other It) are associate members and
engage in related activities other
than Hying.
The Indian Flyers, organized
at the beginning of the quarter,
have launched a student aero
nautical program which includes
lectures, trips to nearby airports,
and flying instruction.
They have arranged with the Palo
Alto Airport for use of three Cess
rut 140's and one Aeronca Champ
for $5 an hour. This is a saving of
$4 an hour over the regular rates.
The group meets every Thursday
night ! i o!M 7:30 to 0:30 in Room 47
of the BAC. A lecture on meteo
rology by Dr. Alfred Sumner of the
Geography Department and Air
Force movies have highlighted past
meetings.
Lari(e monthly meetings are
held the first week of every m*nth
in Bowman Alumni House. They
will meet at Bowman tomorrow
night for yearly elections.
There's just one small hitch in
the club's program. They can't join
die ASSU or be recognized by the
University. The reason? They're a
dangerous" outfit. And nobody
wants to be liable for accidents.
Even the club itself isn't liable for
any damage done to pilots, planes,
oi property. But most members

| carry their own insurance.
Dues in the Flying Indians are $20
a quarter. The club constitution
limits membership to 45â€”30 "fly
ing" members and 15 "associates."
Associate members pay $5 per quar
ter.
Students in the may earn
their pilot's license in one quarter
| for a minimum cost of $272. JUn-
I der normal rates the cost would
i he $405. To get a private pilot's
j license, a student must put in |t
least 40 flying hours, 15 of them
under dual control and 25 solo.
Although they aren't recognized
| by the University, the Flying In-
I dians are given much "unofficial"
I support by the Navy and Air Force.
I One member of the Air Force pro
vides instruction on his own time.
Both branches of the armed forces
j supply films, maps, training aids,
and technical books to the group.
Driving force behind the organi
j zation is president Jack Knoblock.
Other officers are: Bob Chesley,
vice-president; Pat Gillies, secre
tary; and Chuck Sill, treasurer.
Dr. David Webster of the Physics
Department is their faculty adviser.
Any Stanford students who feel
at home G.OOO feet off the ground are
: invited to their meeting tomorrow
I night. The group is new, but it's
going to go places in a hurry. And
j there are nothing but happy land-
I ings in sight.
