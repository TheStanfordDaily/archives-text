A great deal of confusion has arisen as to the baseball playoffs this
; :!son. Fans generally are not clear as to the difference between the PCC
and the CIBA.
As in basketball, the PCC is divided in baseball into a Northern and a
Southern Division. The Southern Division consists of Cal, Stanford, UCLA,
and USC.
Besides this regular league, there is a special league made up of various
independent California schools and those "Big Four." At one time St.
Mary's, USF. COP. and Santa Clara all belonged to the CIBA. All but the
Broncos have presently dropped out of the league, however, leaving a
five-team CIBA.
Thus, it is possible for a team to win ihe Southern Division and yet not
hold the CIBA title. In determining who should represent the West
Coast in the NCAA playoffs, it is the Southern Division winner who plays
the Northern champ for the privilege of traveling to Omaha.
In 1950, the Trojans won the PCC title but were only third in theCIBA.
It war. rather obvious at the time that Stanford had a better team than USC,
so the Trojans waived their right to the playoffs in favor of the Indians.
This season, the CIBA winner is still undertermined, but the Cards have
ill hut cinched the PCC title. There are only two possible ways that any
one could tie Stanford for the right to play the Northern Division winner:
(1) USC could draw even with us if they win all of their remaining
,i ames while the Cards lose all of theirs. In this case, USC would probably
yield once again to Stanford, .seeing as we defeated them in all four of our
contests against them.
(2) In the thrree remaining games against the Indians, if Cal took them
all and in addition defeated UCLA this Friday they could also tie. While
the Bears must win against the Bruins Friday, Stanford faces Santa Clara
in a game that counts only in CIBA play. No doubt Card ace Bob Murphy
will be saved for the latter contest. The Berkeley nine will probably use
A 1 Mathews, who was soundly trounced in his last two outings.
So as you can see, the pressure is all on the Bears, who must win both
games this weekend.
If Stanford should win the conference, the playoff would be held at
the Sunken Diamond the weekend of May 150, the same days the PCC
track meet is scheduled for the Stadium. So Indian fjjns will not he able
(o complain of a lack of sports activities on campus that weekend!
Meanwhile, the teams in the Northern Division are having their troubles.
Because of the wide distances separating the clubs, each team must make
a week-long road trip. Oregon, currently leading the league, has traveled
north to play six games (against Idaho, WSC, and Washington) in seven
days!
One big handicap of their system is that any rained-out games (and
there are plenty this time of year up north) are cancelled. Thus OSC,
who was favored to win the Conference, has suffered by losing to the
weather a pair of contests against push-over Washington.
During years where there is an outstanding independent club, the NCAA
selection committee, headed by Clint Evans of Cal, may require that the
PCC winner face the independent to determine which will represent the
West Coast. Last season Fresno State faced OSC under such an arrange
ment. The only teams up for such consideration this season are the Staters
and Seattle. Both teams are weaker than Fresno was last season when she
lost two straight to the Beavers, and whether or not that game will need
to be played is still open to question.

will be saved for the latter contest. The Berkeley nine will probably use
A 1 Mathews, who was soundly trounced in his last two outings.
So as you can see, the pressure is all on the Bears, who must win both
games this weekend.
If Stanford should win the conference, the playoff would be held at
the Sunken Diamond the weekend of May 150, the same days the PCC
track meet is scheduled for the Stadium. So Indian fjjns will not he able
(o complain of a lack of sports activities on campus that weekend!
Meanwhile, the teams in the Northern Division are having their troubles.
Because of the wide distances separating the clubs, each team must make
a week-long road trip. Oregon, currently leading the league, has traveled
north to play six games (against Idaho, WSC, and Washington) in seven
days!
One big handicap of their system is that any rained-out games (and
there are plenty this time of year up north) are cancelled. Thus OSC,
who was favored to win the Conference, has suffered by losing to the
weather a pair of contests against push-over Washington.
During years where there is an outstanding independent club, the NCAA
selection committee, headed by Clint Evans of Cal, may require that the
PCC winner face the independent to determine which will represent the
West Coast. Last season Fresno State faced OSC under such an arrange
ment. The only teams up for such consideration this season are the Staters
and Seattle. Both teams are weaker than Fresno was last season when she
lost two straight to the Beavers, and whether or not that game will need
to be played is still open to question.
A great deal of confusion has arisen as to the baseball playoffs this
; :!son. Fans generally are not clear as to the difference between the PCC
and the CIBA.
As in basketball, the PCC is divided in baseball into a Northern and a
Southern Division. The Southern Division consists of Cal, Stanford, UCLA,
and USC.
Besides this regular league, there is a special league made up of various
independent California schools and those "Big Four." At one time St.
Mary's, USF. COP. and Santa Clara all belonged to the CIBA. All but the
Broncos have presently dropped out of the league, however, leaving a
five-team CIBA.
Thus, it is possible for a team to win ihe Southern Division and yet not
hold the CIBA title. In determining who should represent the West
Coast in the NCAA playoffs, it is the Southern Division winner who plays
the Northern champ for the privilege of traveling to Omaha.
In 1950, the Trojans won the PCC title but were only third in theCIBA.
It war. rather obvious at the time that Stanford had a better team than USC,
so the Trojans waived their right to the playoffs in favor of the Indians.
This season, the CIBA winner is still undertermined, but the Cards have
ill hut cinched the PCC title. There are only two possible ways that any
one could tie Stanford for the right to play the Northern Division winner:
(1) USC could draw even with us if they win all of their remaining
,i ames while the Cards lose all of theirs. In this case, USC would probably
yield once again to Stanford, .seeing as we defeated them in all four of our
contests against them.
(2) In the thrree remaining games against the Indians, if Cal took them
all and in addition defeated UCLA this Friday they could also tie. While
the Bears must win against the Bruins Friday, Stanford faces Santa Clara
in a game that counts only in CIBA play. No doubt Card ace Bob Murphy
will be saved for the latter contest. The Berkeley nine will probably use
A 1 Mathews, who was soundly trounced in his last two outings.
