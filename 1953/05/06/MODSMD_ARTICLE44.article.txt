# Village to Remain In Present Status
## 
### 
Contrary to recent rumors that
the 80-odd acres which make up
the Stanford Village will be re
leased from "military hold" and j
sold, it was indicated Monday that
there will be no change in the sta
tus of the Village for some time.
Justin Herman, regional director |
ol the Federal Housing and Home
Finance Agency, reported that the j
Defense Department is not ready to j
release the property for sale at this ;
time.
Stanford has leased the land from j
the federal government since 1946.
