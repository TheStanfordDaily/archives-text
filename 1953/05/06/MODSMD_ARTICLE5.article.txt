Stanford firemen answered two
fire alarms yesterday, one by acci
dent.
When the Stanford firemen pulled
up in front of the boathouse to par
ticipate in the* rescue operations for
Charles Meyer, they found a car on
fire nearby. The car belonged to
William Purnell. The front seat up
holstery of the car was damaged.
Firemen extinguished a small
grass fire at the Con Home about 5
p.m. The fire was started by a
workman who was welding one of
the large iron cats that stand at the
entry of the Home.
