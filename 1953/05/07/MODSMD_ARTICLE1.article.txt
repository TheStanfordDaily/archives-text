## Beauty and Profit Are the Twin Goals Of Stanford's Ambitious Land Program

Stanford is currently launch
ing the most ambitious land de
velopment program ever under
taken by a private school or uni
versity.
The program promises to make
Stanford one of the nio.st prosperous
areas in an already "Golden" Cali
fornia.
It's the plan of University officials
to develop the 9,000 acre Stanford
farm into an educational, industrial
arid business community—a modern
community that is well planned and
well integrated.
"An aesthetic as well as profitable
area," is the way Alf Brandin, Uni
versity business manager and exec
utive officer for land development,
put it.
At the moment a comprehensive !

master plan is being drawn up by
(lie internationally known firm of
Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, a
plan that will detail the next ma- I
jor moves in the development pro- j
gram.
Already, in some areas, the pro- ]
gram is hitting on all cylinders.
Construction has begun on the two
million dollar Eastman Kod;ik plant, j
Work is already complete on. the one |
million dollar Varum Associates lab
oratory.
Prospective tenants are already j
applying for space in Stanford's pro
posed $ J 5 million, shopping center.
And a residential tract is being de
veloped on a northern portion of the
land.
University planners have listed
two reasons for the long-range de
velopment program. They arc:
1. The University needs addition- j
al sources of income lo continue
successful operation.
2. Stanford property is the last i

large bloc of undeveloped land
along the already over-crowded
Peninsula and is needed to satis
fy the prospective growth of the
area.
Robert Wert, Assistant to the
President, has said that the develop
ment. program will not detract from
the beauty of the Stanford area.
"University planners are doing a
first class job of development. Com
mercially, aesthetically, and socially,
Stanford will be top-flight."
According to Brandin, steps for
land development -have not been
taken until recent years "because
until a few years ago land around
the University's property was still
available for development."
"Today," says Brandin, "the value
of our lnnfl and the nocd for its de
velopment is greater than ever be
fore."
(A summary of the latest develop
ments of the program appear on
p;iges 2 and .'5 of today's Daily.)
