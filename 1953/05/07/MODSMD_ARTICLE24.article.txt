# A 						Modern Community with the Campus as Hub
## MUFTI MILLION-DOLLAR PROJECT 60 Acres—A Shopping Haven 
### 
The commercial center is no
longer merely a pretty picture
hanging in the office of Stanford
Business Manager Alf Brandin.
Now it is a series of tacit
agreements with three of the
West's laiger retail firms the

Emporium, Roos Brothers, and
I. Magnin.
It is a set of detailed plans that
are now being completed by the
internationally known architect,
We I ton Becket.
It is a list of recommendations
being put in final frame by master

planners.
And within two years it should
be reality ... a $15 inilllion real
ity.
That is the present cost esti
mate for the rambling, multi-unit
building. According to present
tentative plans (be total enclosed
floor space will he 780,01)0 square
feet.
Aside from the* commercial giants
listed, the center will house smaller
businesses, shops and grocery stores
and pharmacies. In short, a galaxy
ol all the necessary components of
an up-to-date retail district.
And this center will be laid out
for the shopper's convenience, par
ticularly lor the shoppers who drive
to town along the car - crowded
highways. For il is planned that
surrounding the center will be
parking area sufficient, for between
{i,OOO and 0,000 cars.
According to present plans, the
giant center will be built in an
ultra-modern style—with sweep
ing glass and cool, wide shopping
lanes—and witb all units linked
by large archways.
Present sketches outline the cen
ter as a soi't ol mammoth "T" in
de. with Koos Brothers and I.
Magnin located at either end of the
cross bar and the Emporium located
at the base.
However, as Brandin is careful to
point out, the plans are not yet final.
The Emporium has tentatively
agreed to lease 250,000 square feet
of the center's space. And I. Mag
nin has similarly agreed to lease
50.000 square feet and Roos Brothers
25,000.
A( the moment it is hoped that
round - .breaking for Ihe center
can be engineered sometime next
spring. At least that's the target
date, though it is possible, if cur
rent negotiations are quickly
completed, that actual work can
begin within six months.
Area picked for the center is a
(50-acre plot located between the
Palo Alio Hospital and San Francis
quito Creek and El Camino Peal.
The center will have a 1,500-foot
frontage along the busy thorough
fare.
University officials say that a for
mal go - ahead Order will not be
given until there is assurance that
a majority of the shopping center
space will be leased.
And at present the prospects look
good, according to Brandin.
Brandin reported that most of the
negotiations concerning the center
are being handled by Coldwell
Bunker and Co., official real-estate
advisers to the University.—H.R.
Though the center, when com
plete, will be the largest along the
Peninsula, it will be so built that it
can grow even larger. Brandin
points out that the possibilities' for
growth along the Peninsula are
great and that the University will
make every effort to keep pace.

spring. At least that's the target
date, though it is possible, if cur
rent negotiations are quickly
completed, that actual work can
begin within six months.
Area picked for the center is a
(50-acre plot located between the
Palo Alio Hospital and San Francis
quito Creek and El Camino Peal.
The center will have a 1,500-foot
frontage along the busy thorough
fare.
University officials say that a for
mal go - ahead Order will not be
given until there is assurance that
a majority of the shopping center
space will be leased.
And at present the prospects look
good, according to Brandin.
Brandin reported that most of the
negotiations concerning the center
are being handled by Coldwell
Bunker and Co., official real-estate
advisers to the University.—H.R.
Though the center, when com
plete, will be the largest along the
Peninsula, it will be so built that it
can grow even larger. Brandin
points out that the possibilities' for
growth along the Peninsula are
great and that the University will
make every effort to keep pace.
The commercial center is no
longer merely a pretty picture
hanging in the office of Stanford
Business Manager Alf Brandin.
Now it is a series of tacit
agreements with three of the
West's laiger retail firms the

Emporium, Roos Brothers, and
I. Magnin.
It is a set of detailed plans that
are now being completed by the
internationally known architect,
We I ton Becket.
It is a list of recommendations
being put in final frame by master

planners.
And within two years it should
be reality ... a $15 inilllion real
ity.
That is the present cost esti
mate for the rambling, multi-unit
building. According to present
tentative plans (be total enclosed
floor space will he 780,01)0 square
feet.
Aside from the* commercial giants
listed, the center will house smaller
businesses, shops and grocery stores
and pharmacies. In short, a galaxy
ol all the necessary components of
an up-to-date retail district.
And this center will be laid out
for the shopper's convenience, par
ticularly lor the shoppers who drive
to town along the car - crowded
highways. For il is planned that
surrounding the center will be
parking area sufficient, for between
{i,OOO and 0,000 cars.
According to present plans, the
giant center will be built in an
ultra-modern style—with sweep
ing glass and cool, wide shopping
lanes—and witb all units linked
by large archways.
Present sketches outline the cen
ter as a soi't ol mammoth "T" in
de. with Koos Brothers and I.
Magnin located at either end of the
cross bar and the Emporium located
at the base.
However, as Brandin is careful to
point out, the plans are not yet final.
The Emporium has tentatively
agreed to lease 250,000 square feet
of the center's space. And I. Mag
nin has similarly agreed to lease
50.000 square feet and Roos Brothers
25,000.
A( the moment it is hoped that
round - .breaking for Ihe center
can be engineered sometime next
spring. At least that's the target
