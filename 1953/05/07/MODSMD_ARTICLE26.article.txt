## Big Dreams and Careful Planning 
### 
Leland Stanford, the founder of the University, was one of the
financial giants ol the West, one of the men who helped develop
California and win for it the name "Golden" State. Stanford was
a capitalist, a money maker, shrewd, sometimes hard and relent
less
But also he was a man of dreams, dreams for California, dreams
foi his vast Palo Alto farm.
And over the years his dreams have largely come true.
California has become rich, affluent, almost the mecca for the
j whole United States.
And his farm has become one of the leading educational insti
tutions, Stanford University.
But today there are new dreams, as large and magnificent as
those of Stanford's current among the officials of the University.
These dreams rest with the further development of California
and Stanford's cherished farm.
They rest with the development of the Stanford lands into an
educational, commercial, business and residential whole.
They call for the development of the 9,000 acre farm into a
"well integrated" modern comunity that will include 3,000 acres
for campus use.
This marks the first time that a private school or university
has attempted such a mammoth task.
And this is the kind of far-sighted dreaming and planning that
the old Senator would have liked. It's his kind of thinking, care
j ful, thorough, based on sweeping imagination and good sense.
There is nothing hasty in the planning, as the maps and charts
and reports in the office of the president and the business manager
show. x

Now that most of the general plans are complete, a iinal ex
haustive check is being made. One of the foremost land planning
firms in the nation, Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, is drawing up
<'i master plan that will detail all possibilities and recommend the
! :final course.
But some aspects of land development are not necessarily wait
ing on the completion of the master plan. Already two large in
dustrial firms have leased Stanford land, one having completed its
million dollar project Monday.
A large developer of residential lands also has leased lands.
And it is understood that three of the West's top merchants will
sign foimal leases for shopping center space upon the completion
of more detailed plans.
Reasons given for pressing the development of Stanford lands,
lor converting Stanford's quiet foothills into a busy community,
are two-fold.
1. The financial needs of the University. These have increased
greatly in lecent years under the pressure of inflation
2. The land needs of California. New housing and industrial
areas are in desperate demand in the state to accommodate ever in
creasing population.
It is hoped that within 25 years the whole of Stanford lands will
have been developed, with about 60,000 people living in the
pleasant, rolling area behind the campus, with thousands working
in the industrial area toward Barron Park, with thousands more
employed in the commercial center toward Menlo Park, and with
thousands of eager students attending Stanford University a
university built by a progressive and maintained by progressives.

foi his vast Palo Alto farm.
And over the years his dreams have largely come true.
California has become rich, affluent, almost the mecca for the
j whole United States.
And his farm has become one of the leading educational insti
tutions, Stanford University.
But today there are new dreams, as large and magnificent as
those of Stanford's current among the officials of the University.
These dreams rest with the further development of California
and Stanford's cherished farm.
They rest with the development of the Stanford lands into an
educational, commercial, business and residential whole.
They call for the development of the 9,000 acre farm into a
"well integrated" modern comunity that will include 3,000 acres
for campus use.
This marks the first time that a private school or university
has attempted such a mammoth task.
And this is the kind of far-sighted dreaming and planning that
the old Senator would have liked. It's his kind of thinking, care
j ful, thorough, based on sweeping imagination and good sense.
There is nothing hasty in the planning, as the maps and charts
and reports in the office of the president and the business manager
show. x

Now that most of the general plans are complete, a iinal ex
haustive check is being made. One of the foremost land planning
firms in the nation, Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, is drawing up
<'i master plan that will detail all possibilities and recommend the
! :final course.
But some aspects of land development are not necessarily wait
ing on the completion of the master plan. Already two large in
dustrial firms have leased Stanford land, one having completed its
million dollar project Monday.
A large developer of residential lands also has leased lands.
And it is understood that three of the West's top merchants will
sign foimal leases for shopping center space upon the completion
of more detailed plans.
Reasons given for pressing the development of Stanford lands,
lor converting Stanford's quiet foothills into a busy community,
are two-fold.
1. The financial needs of the University. These have increased
greatly in lecent years under the pressure of inflation
2. The land needs of California. New housing and industrial
areas are in desperate demand in the state to accommodate ever in
creasing population.
It is hoped that within 25 years the whole of Stanford lands will
have been developed, with about 60,000 people living in the
pleasant, rolling area behind the campus, with thousands working
in the industrial area toward Barron Park, with thousands more
employed in the commercial center toward Menlo Park, and with
thousands of eager students attending Stanford University a
university built by a progressive and maintained by progressives.

Leland Stanford, the founder of the University, was one of the
financial giants ol the West, one of the men who helped develop
California and win for it the name "Golden" State. Stanford was
a capitalist, a money maker, shrewd, sometimes hard and relent
less
But also he was a man of dreams, dreams for California, dreams
foi his vast Palo Alto farm.
And over the years his dreams have largely come true.
California has become rich, affluent, almost the mecca for the
j whole United States.
And his farm has become one of the leading educational insti
