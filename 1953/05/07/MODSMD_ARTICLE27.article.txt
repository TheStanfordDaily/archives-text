# KODAK, VARIAN ASSOCIATES
## Industries Come to Stanford Land 
### 
One hundred and thirty-eight
acres of choice Stanford lands
are currently being held aside
"or industrial development.
And though the land was des
ignated for that purpose only a
ew short years ago, already two
.'arge, nationally known firms |
have located in the area.
One, Varian Associates, has near- I
: lv completed its over $1 million plant
laboratory. The firm expects to j
j move in by the first of July.
The other, Eastman Kodak, began |
construction Monday of its $2 mil- j

plant. Its completion is expected by j
next January.
Varian Associates are the sole
manufacturers of the klystron j
lube, an essential electronic part
of radar instruments. The firm's
chief plant is in San Carlos.
The Kodak company intends to !
make its Stanford plant one of the
largest film-processing stations in
the West.
Stanford negotiated its first lease
in its land - development program

with the Varian Associates, a firm
that, had had long contact with the
University.
The two Varian brothers and
founders of the firm, Russell and
Sigurd, did their initial experi
ments on the klystron tube here.
Three members of tne company's
board of directors are also members

of the Stanford faculty,
The three are: Leonard SchifT,
head or ;ne Physics Department;
Edward L. Ginzton, professor of ap
plied physics and electrical engi
neering; and Frederick Terman,
dean ol the School of Engineering.
Varian's initial lease was for 10
acres Of the so-called industrial re

gion located south of the campus,
bordered roughly by El Camino
Heal and P«<*p Mill Road.
However, soon alter the first lease
was contracted, Varian secured an
option on an additional acres ol'
land, which they leased formally
last year.
It is the hope of the firm to add a
$500,000 wing lo their present struc
ture.
The Kodak lease was negotiated
last year.
Both I lie Varian and the Kodak
leases are lor 90 years.
Judging from current real estate
values. i( is estimated (hat the
Stanford industrial lands are val
ued somewhere in the neighbor
hood of $15,000 an acre. Hack in
1951, when the first Varian lease
was let, it is understood the value
was set at about $5,000 an acre.
The industrial region has been in
corporated into the city of Palo
Alto.—H. R.
