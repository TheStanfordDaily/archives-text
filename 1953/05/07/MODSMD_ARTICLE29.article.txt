# ... That's the Plan
## LAND USE CHART PLANNING FOR TOMORROW No 'Tight Little Unit' far Campus 
### 
Today a little more than 1,000
of the 9,000 acres of University
property is used for campus
buildings and grouwds.
Tomorrow (that term used by
planners to express the indefi
nite future) 3,000 acres of land
will be restricted to campus use.
In Stanford's overall land devel
opment program, the Planning Of
fice and the Board of Trustees have
agreed on that approximate acreage
figure as "space enough for any
eventuality."
The Planning Office has voiced
assurance that the commercial, in
dustrial, and residential develop
ment of Stanford land will not force
the campus into a tight little unit
under the shadows of shopping cen
ters and housing tracts. Extensive
and necessary as the development
of Stanford property may be, prime
consideration has been given to the
development of the Stanford
"plant."
Most of the development ideas
for the campus itself are "on the
horizon" and await the results of
studies being made by the Plan
ning Office and its subsidiaries.
The heed for some campus de
velopment, particularly housing, has
been so pressing, however, that
some definite plans have material
ized. They are:
1. A $9 million dorm program
designed to house 1.838 additional
students and thus bring Stanford
closer to being a "residential"

University.
2. The proposed Tresidder Me
morial Union which the Univer
sity hopes will "strengthen the
social bonds existing between the
student body."
o. A new post office building
and an extension to the Book
store.
4. A new geophysics building
and an extension to the Electrical
Engineering Building.
The $9 million dorm program is
still in the planning stage. So far
the Board of Trustees has appro
priated enough money only for ar
chitect's drawings for the four dor
mitories proposed by the program
—an undergraduate men's dorm, a
graduate men's dorm, a women's
dorm, and an addition to Stern
Hall.
The "hope" of the Planning Office
is that construction on the first of
these dorms, the one lor undergrad
uate men, will begin within a year,
and that the building will be ready
for occupancy in September of 1954.
The need for an extension to Uni
versity housing facilities has been
evident since the end of the last
war. The present enrollment has
been so far above University hous
ing capacity that less than 35 per
cent of the students are living in
what the administration leaders
consider "adequate" housing. (Stan
ford Village, Encina, and a number
of the Row houses are not consid
ered adequate.)
The general long-range policy of
the University is to establish Stan
ford as a residential community, or

one in which at least 65 per cent of |
the students are housed on the j
campus. At present onlv 35 per cent |
ol' the students are housed in Uni- j
versity residences, anc\ the $9 mil- I
lion dorm program will bring the
campus residence percentage to
nearly 50 per cent.
The desire to establish Stanford
as a residence university, according
to the Planning Office, is based on
two goals: further integration of
student life into the activities of
the University and housing capacity
great enough to permit an increased
enrollment.
The proposed Tresidder Memorial
Student Union is probably closer to
actual construction than any other
proposed campus building. Last
week, a Student Union Committee
headed by Jack Frazer submitted
the results of the student survey to
the Planning Office. The Planning
Office is now tabulating the results
of that survey into specific plans

for the architecture and layout of
the building.
Construction of the Union should
begin "within a few years," the
Planning Office says. With $600,000
available from the Tresidder Me
morial Union Fund, the biggest ob
j stacle to the construction of the
building has been hurdled.
The plans for the new post office
building and additional science
buildings are less definite than the
dorm program and the student un
ion. They are, however, the next
steps in campus development.
In that development, Eldridge T.
Spencer, Director of the Planning
Office, has expressed the "philo
sophical ideal" of campus develop
ment:
"In planning the future of the
Stanford campus, we want to leave
the next generation free of any
great restrictions. We want a flex
ible campus in® which ihere is no
'Chinese wall' or 'iron curtain'."

9,000 ACRES—The above map shows the extent of University
property and the major areas of development. The white area
represents the present campus grounds, and the grey area is
the territory which will be restricted in the future to campus

use. The rest of the area within the University boundary (dark
area on map) will be developed into residential, commercial, and
industrial areas.
