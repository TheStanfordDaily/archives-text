# 5,500 RESIDENTIAL ACRES
## Huge Residential Area Planned 
### 
Almost 5,500 acres of residen
tial area on Stanford land.
With hundreds of individually
styled homes.
And apartment houses, parks,
schools, and shopping centers.
These are the ideas currently un
der study by the University for the
residential development of more
than half of Stanford's land.
According to Alf Brandin, Execu- I
tive Officer for Land Development,
such ideas are only ideas, but
"sometime between 25 and 50 years
from now, all of the property des
ignated for residential use will be
developed."
Such residential development is
a large part of the overall land de
velopment of University property, a
development designed to increase
financial revenue to the University.
The first phase of Stanford's
residential development has al
ready materialized in what the
Land Development Olfice refers
to as "a pilot model"—Lot 71) in
Mcnlo Park.
That pilot model is the "Stanford
| Acres" tract which has been leased
to the Pacific Construction Com
pany to build 43 homes. Fourteen
of the homes have been completed
and are now occupied, and the rest
are still under construction.
According to Brandin, the "pilot
model" has proven successful.
! Some of the first homes to he sold
in the area were purchased by
attorneys and real estate brokers,
"sufficient testament to the va
lidity of the lease arrangements"
according to Brandin.
Those leases work this way:
The University leases the land it
self to the Pacific Construction
Company and is paid $5,000 an acre
for the 16 acres on the property.
The Pacific Construction Company
in turn leases the land to individual
home owners. The land itself re
mains technically the property of
the University, and the houses and
improvements belong to individual
residents.
Those residents are currently
paying anywhere from $2(>,00(l to
$40,000 for homes that have been
styled according to the wishes of

Stanford. Each of them displays
an individual architecture, a re
sult of a University demand that
the housing tracts on its property
do not become "cracker-hox ar
rangements."
Although the land has been leased
to the Pacific Construction Com
pany, the University *still maintains
an active interest in the develop
ment of the homes on its property.
Each contract between the con
struction company and Stanford

calls for co-ordination between the
two in the land's development. One
of the stipulations in that contract
is that each lot on the land is at
least 10.000 square feet, with 1,400
square feet of "livable space" in
the building itself.
When and how the rest of the
land designated for residential areas
will be developed is not much more
than crystal-ball gazing. The Land
Development Office must consider
such factors as population changes,

economic conditions, and possible
real estate slumps.
But with the Stanford property
the only large single real estate
block left on the Peninsula, the
University is making rapid prog
ress in its plans to develop the
whole area.
Other areas for development are
now awaiting the results of the
master plan being prepared by the
firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Mer
i rill.—W.G.
