# ATHLETE OF THE WEEK
## Murphy's Hurling Paces Curds 
### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
Two weeks ago, he allowed
California five hits to beat the
Bears 7-1 before Governor War
ren and a few thousand friends.
Last weekend he allowed but
four hits, and got his shutout, as
Stanford squeezed by UCLA 2-0.
Now, anticlimactically enough,
the Daily has named pitcher Bob
Murphy its "Athlete of the
Week."
Flinger Murphy lias been having
quite a season this year. Last sea
son, Murphy was Stanford's third
pitcher behind Joe Chez and Roger
Qsenbaugh, although he did hurl
more innings than the aforemen
tioned twosome. The figure was 79
innings. His season's record: three
wins, five losses, and one tie.
So far this season, Mr. Murphy
lias an overall 9-1 record, with an
almost amazing 6-0 mark in the
CIBA. Amazing, in that he has
credit for two-thirds of the Indians'
nine victories in league play. He
has struck out 78 batters, and he
lias earned-run averages of 1.98
and 1.76 in overall and league play
respectively.
Murphy, a medium-sized, bespec
tacled right-hander from San Ma
tea, relics mostly on a fast ball. Hp
also throws a curve, a slider, and a
very effective change-up. His main
trouble, and it has been cropping
up more infrequently as the season
moves along, is a momentary loss of
control in which he may pass two
or three batters at one time. That
"Irish temper" doesn't help him, as
he hates to lose. However, when he
,is "right," and his fastball has a hop
on it, Murphy is extremely hard to
beat.
Like his battery mate, Jack Shep
ards, Murph says he would like to
play professional ball and attend
Stanford Business School in the off
season.
Strangely enough, the ball game

which gave Murph his "biggest i
charge" was an early-season affair !
in which he almost blew an 8-1 [
lead to Santa Clara in the last two
innings. The Broncs, having picked j
up five runs in the eighth and ninth j
innings, were threatening in the j

ninth with bases loaded and only
one out. Murph rose to the occasion
and whiffed the last two batters for
an 8-6 Stanford triumph. At that
moment, he was relying on "guts"
rather than on stuff.

season.
Strangely enough, the ball game

which gave Murph his "biggest i
charge" was an early-season affair !
in which he almost blew an 8-1 [
lead to Santa Clara in the last two
innings. The Broncs, having picked j
up five runs in the eighth and ninth j
innings, were threatening in the j

ninth with bases loaded and only
one out. Murph rose to the occasion
and whiffed the last two batters for
an 8-6 Stanford triumph. At that
moment, he was relying on "guts"
rather than on stuff.


808 MURPHY
