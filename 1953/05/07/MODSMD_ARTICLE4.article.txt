day. < % '
These officials said the outlook
for a successful conclusion of the
Panmunjom negotiations at this
stage was "pessimistic" and "dis
turbing." They said the patience of
the United Nations command was
near the breaking point — barring
quick progress.
Authorities said the big question
was how much longer the U.N.
would keep trying to reach an
agreement. The clear indication was
tliat it would not be much longer if
the current stalemate continued.
The truce talks were revived on
April 2d in the hope that the North
Korean and Chinese Communists
would follow up their agreement to
exchange sick and wounded prison
ers with definite steps toward an
armistice.
