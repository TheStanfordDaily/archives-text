# Change Recommended for 'Lone Woman Rule
## 
### DOROTHY DODGE Editorial Assistant, The Daily 
AWS Board yesterday unanimously approved a recommendation that
the "lone woman" rule be stated in the Women's Social Regulation not as
a definite rule, but as a standard of conduct.
The recommendation was made by a special committee of senior women
whom AWS appointed last fall to study the rule. Before the change be
come* effective, it must be approved by Excom and be voted on by the
women students.
It will be discussed in bouse meetings next Monday, voted on by
the women in house meetings May 18. It has already been approved by
President J. K. Wallace Sterling, Dean of Students 11. Donald Winbigler,
and Chief Counselor for Women Elva F. Brown.
The recommended change will also be explained to men's groups at
their regular meetings next week.
The present "lone woman" rule is worded:

It is not considered acceptable for a woman to be in a man's residence,
fraternity, or apartment, on or off campus, except in the company of at
least one other woman."
The new wording would be:
"Each Stanford woman is expccted to assume individual responsibility
to uphold and to help maintain both within and without the University
the high standards of conduct which reflect favorably upon her, as a Stan
ford woman, and upon the University. These standards are particularly
applicable to a woman's conduct in a man's residence. Within these stan
dards, a woman may enter the downstairs social area of a man's residence.
The act of entering is in itself neither acceptable nor unacceptable; it be
comes unacceptable when a woman's conduct is inconsistent with the
Fundamental Standard."
In its report, tbe committee recommended that orientation on the
subject put new stress on the Fundamental Standard. They explained
that under the change, a woman would have tbe added responsibility of
judging each "lone woman" situation as it arose and determining how

hrr conduct would reflect on her own and the University's reputation.
The committee also recommended that the orientation stress the fact
that "individual responsibility doesn't mean individual license," and that
the Fundamental Standard specifically mentions the "respect for order,
morality, and personal honor, and the rights of others as is demanded of
good citizens."
The points recommended for orientation also included:
1. "The symbol factor of a lone woman entering a man's residence cannot
be completely dismissed, particularly in an off-campus situation. . . . More
careful consideration must be given in regard to. the 'appearance factor'
in such . . . situations."
2. "In spite of however honorable the individual's intentions are, the
fact remains that judgment of a woman entering a mpn's residence late
at night and particularly off-campus may incur reproach. Careful dis
cretion must be exercised, since actions reflect not only on the woman, hut
on the University."
3. "Inasmuch as cases of unacceptable conduct will be dealt with as

similar violations of the spirit of Fundamental Standard would bp, thir 112
person responsibility should be stressed to help increase the respect for
the, standard."
4 "It is desirable to stimulate discussion in order to define and se< up
standards of conduct appropriate for a Stanford woman."
Today's recommendation represents the climax of more than two pjtrs
of study on changing the ride. Fundamental Standard Committee sug
gested altering it, and <\WS last fall appointed a committee made up >112
Joyce Ballantinc (chairman), Joanne Hixson. Kilbce Cormack, Dorothy
Dodge, Carol Roselyn, and Joan Coldren to discuss the rule.
Original objections to the rule included inconvenience, lack of current
enforcement, and the fact that the area of conduct it deals with in covered by
the Fundamental Standard.
Proponents of retaining the rule argued that it did represent a generally
accepted standard of morality, it helped give women a guide post 1o conduct,
and it. provided the University Administration with something concrete,
to point to when called on to defend student standards of morality.

Today's recommendation represents the climax of more than two pjtrs
of study on changing the ride. Fundamental Standard Committee sug
gested altering it, and <\WS last fall appointed a committee made up >112
Joyce Ballantinc (chairman), Joanne Hixson. Kilbce Cormack, Dorothy
Dodge, Carol Roselyn, and Joan Coldren to discuss the rule.
Original objections to the rule included inconvenience, lack of current
enforcement, and the fact that the area of conduct it deals with in covered by
the Fundamental Standard.
Proponents of retaining the rule argued that it did represent a generally
accepted standard of morality, it helped give women a guide post 1o conduct,
and it. provided the University Administration with something concrete,
to point to when called on to defend student standards of morality.
AWS Board yesterday unanimously approved a recommendation that
the "lone woman" rule be stated in the Women's Social Regulation not as
a definite rule, but as a standard of conduct.
The recommendation was made by a special committee of senior women
whom AWS appointed last fall to study the rule. Before the change be
come* effective, it must be approved by Excom and be voted on by the
women students.
It will be discussed in bouse meetings next Monday, voted on by
the women in house meetings May 18. It has already been approved by
President J. K. Wallace Sterling, Dean of Students 11. Donald Winbigler,
and Chief Counselor for Women Elva F. Brown.
The recommended change will also be explained to men's groups at
their regular meetings next week.
The present "lone woman" rule is worded:

It is not considered acceptable for a woman to be in a man's residence,
fraternity, or apartment, on or off campus, except in the company of at
least one other woman."
The new wording would be:
"Each Stanford woman is expccted to assume individual responsibility
to uphold and to help maintain both within and without the University
the high standards of conduct which reflect favorably upon her, as a Stan
ford woman, and upon the University. These standards are particularly
applicable to a woman's conduct in a man's residence. Within these stan
dards, a woman may enter the downstairs social area of a man's residence.
The act of entering is in itself neither acceptable nor unacceptable; it be
comes unacceptable when a woman's conduct is inconsistent with the
Fundamental Standard."
In its report, tbe committee recommended that orientation on the
subject put new stress on the Fundamental Standard. They explained
that under the change, a woman would have tbe added responsibility of
judging each "lone woman" situation as it arose and determining how

hrr conduct would reflect on her own and the University's reputation.
The committee also recommended that the orientation stress the fact
that "individual responsibility doesn't mean individual license," and that
the Fundamental Standard specifically mentions the "respect for order,
morality, and personal honor, and the rights of others as is demanded of
good citizens."
The points recommended for orientation also included:
1. "The symbol factor of a lone woman entering a man's residence cannot
be completely dismissed, particularly in an off-campus situation. . . . More
careful consideration must be given in regard to. the 'appearance factor'
in such . . . situations."
2. "In spite of however honorable the individual's intentions are, the
fact remains that judgment of a woman entering a mpn's residence late
at night and particularly off-campus may incur reproach. Careful dis
cretion must be exercised, since actions reflect not only on the woman, hut
on the University."
3. "Inasmuch as cases of unacceptable conduct will be dealt with as

similar violations of the spirit of Fundamental Standard would bp, thir 112
person responsibility should be stressed to help increase the respect for
the, standard."
