TOKYO, Friday, May 8 (UP) —
The U.S. government today studied
a Communi s t compromise plan
bringing the Korean truce negotia
tors closer to agreement than they
j have ever been.
Ijt. Gen. William K. Harrison
checked the Red scheme to Wash
ington and other United Nations
capitals for the decision that was
too big to make in the Panmunjom
conference hut.
A Communist Peiping radio
broadcast said today (hat a Ko
rean armistice "is completely
within reach" if tho U.N. accepts
either the new Red plan or the
earlier proposal to move reluctant
Kc<| prisoners to a neutral coun
| try.
On the 11th day of the renewed
conference Lt. Gen. Nam fl :;udden
ly gave in on basic parts of the
deadlock over what to do with war
prisoners resisting return to their
homelands.
He handed over an eight - point,
program which in effect accepted
the so-called "Indian plan" for
working out the prisoner problem.
The plan was approved by the U.N.
last December, but was rejected by
Russia and the satellites.
'flic Communist truce leader
complied with the Allied demand
that the Reds name their choice
for a neutral custodian of unwill
ing prisoner, lie also agreed that
the prisoners should l»e left in
Korea until their fate is deter
mined.
The negotiators still had to find a
common ground on insuring against
thi- return of unwilling prisoners
while they are being told about the
desirability of repatriation, anil set
ting a time limit for final disposition
of the last-ditch holdouts by a po
litical confcrcncc.
