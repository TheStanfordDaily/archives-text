# International Issues: Both Sides
## 
### 
Isn't the Public Exercises Committee bound
by the same code that requires students spon
soring speakers to present representatives of
all sides to an issue?
Or is next week's Tuesday Evening Series
speaker to be an ardent supporter of the Zion
ist movement?
We are prompted to ask these questions
by the appearance on last Tuesday's Mem
Aud lecture platform of Anwar. Nashashibi,
who presented the Arab viewpoint on the
Middle East in no uncertain terms. Mr. Nasha
shibi, by tlie way. was scheduled in a hurry
to leplace a veiy prominent speaker who
couldn't come.
Tu pro vide an environment where ideas
cjl oil kinds may be /reeiy espoused and
considered is one of the functions of a true
University.
For this reason we were greatly encouraged
when the Board of Trustees relaxed their ban
on partisan political speakers on campus.
However, the Board made a very wise res
ervation in its relaxation.
It requited that a balance be maintained
between representatives ol various partisan
issues.
This balance is healthy because it preserves
the wholesome clash of thought that nourishes
scholarship.

Now the appearance of an Arab speaker
at Stanford is all very good, because the
Arab viewpoint has been sadly ignored in
this country lor the past several years.
But when the Arab viewpoint is presented
at Stanford out of its relationship to the Zion
ist viewpoint, it ceases to be the expression
of an idea and becomes a propaganda ha
rangue.
Inherent in the presentation ol only one
side ol international issues is an even great
er danger, we believe, than in one sided
speeches on matters o! American partisan
issues.
On the less familiar international issues, the
student is less equipped to soil truth from
untruth on the basis of previous knowledge.
We conclude, therefore:
I. That the spirit of tha Board of Trustees'
ruling includes partisan or controversial is
sues on an international level, as well as on
a national plane. •
2. That the Public Exercises Committee has
erred in its planning of the Tuesday Evening
Series program.
3. That to correct this error, the Public Ex
ercises Committee should exert every effort
to schedule a Zionist speaker this quarter.
