RICHARD 1,. BAI.CII
Chief Counselor for Men
During the coming months of June anil July many
Stanford men will be reclassified by their draft
boards. Those who are now 1.-S or 11-S are subject
to reclassification to I-A.
Their deferments for the academic year 1953-54 will
be reviewed in the light of standing in class and
Selective Service Test score.
It is the obligation of each student to keep his
draft board informed of his intent and to request
that the University, through the Counselor for
Men's Office, forward a Selective Service Form 109
to his draft hoard.
Recently Stanford men who have been classified
I-A or 11-S have received a form in the mail which,
when filled out and returned to the Counselor for
Men's Office, constitutes a request that a IU9 form
be sent during the latter part of June or the first
part of July. II there are any students classified 1-A.
I-S oi 11-S who have not received this form, they
should call at Building IUO, Inner Quad and obtain it
from Miss Martens at the draft desk
Due to a per cent change in Air Force ROTC policy,
there are a number of qualified men who will lose
their 1-D classifications because of lack of quota under
categories 2 and 3 in the Air Force ROTC program.
Men currently enrolled in the Air Force ROTC pro
gram should take the May 21 Selective Service Quali
fication Test and call at the Counselor for Men's Of
fice to fill out a request for a 109 form to be sent to
their draft board.

Applications for the May 21 test must lie post
marked not later than May 11. This procedure is
suggested because of the limited quotas and as a
precautionary measure for those who are desirous of
continuing their education.
Men receiving a change from ff-S or I-S to a 1-A
classification who are in the upper hall oi the fresh -
man class, upper two third;, ol the sophomore class,
upper three-fourths ol the junior class and upper
hall ol the senior class and at the same time have
successfully passed the Selective Service Qualifi
cation Test should inform their draft hoards that
they are desirous of continuing their education and
appeal their I-A classification.
Do not let HI days elapse before appealing re
classification to l-A. Inform your hoard that a Hl!»
