## Re Nashashibi 
### 
To the Editor:
Ori his great quest for "Justice," Me. Nashashihi
lias swept through the campus. It was a true inspira
tion to listen to his oratory. It is nothing short of
magic what Mr. N. can do to - and with—Justice!
The Tuesday evening lecture was billed us a dis
cussion Of the Arabs of Jordan and Palestine, and
their attitude towards the U.S. It became evident,
however, in the course of Mr. N's address, that this
relationship is somewhat indirect; indeed, the Arabs,
it appears, have no self-determined attitude at all
If the U S will strangle the young state of Israel,
Ruod and tine; should it, however, continue only to
tolerate it then these true pillars of democracy in the
Middle East Jordan and its neighbors* will just have
to become Communists.
Prom here, the speaker proceeded to read the
Israelis the riot act. They were accused, first of
all, of dispossessing the poor Arab landowners by •
—believe it or not—purchase. They were further
accused of hogging all the most fertile plains of
Palestine—having cheated the Arab landholder who
thought it a great stroke of businp&s when he sold
those satne plains to the Zionists when they were
swamps.
Prom here, we are directed in this great quest lor
Justice to the United Nations. It is made cleai to us
that after the Arabs invaded Israel with the brazen
declaration that never would they abide by the UN.
decision to partition Palestine, it is now up to Israel
to fulfill to the letter U.N resolutions concerning
Arab refugees from this war.
These unfortunate refugees are made the pawns
in the tragic Middle Eastern picture. Illiterate peas
ants in the majority, they were told by their leaders
to leave Palestine for a "two weeks' vacation," after
which they could take their pick of Tel Aviv real es

tate. They left. The Arab war machine couldn't quite
make it. Zionist atrocity stories were conveniently
discovered to explain the exodus; and now, of course,
the :.ole responsibility is laid at Israel's doorstep. The
Arab governments, who rushed in to grab whatever
could be grabbed, are entirely free of any moral or
financial responsibility for these refugees. If lbn Saud
wishes to have another Constellation plant* (cosl
$2,000,000), that is his own prerogative.
Kiit .Vlr. Nashashihi is a reasonable man: for a
slight consideration of $1(1 billion he would let by
gones be bygones. This sum would amount to
$11,(100 per refugee—woman, baby o' beggar. When
asked to explain how lie arrived at this figure, (for
which one could build three complete Palestines,
side by side), he mused that real estate values in
formerly IOn.OOO-people-strong Jaffa alone were
worth over a billion. Dear reader, sit hack and think
how priceless (he much better developed Anaheim,
A/usa and Cucanionga would lie at that valuation
rate. Ye (»ods!
Israel is willing lo do its utmost to help these refu
fee.>;. The Middle East will not he settled until these
people are resettled, but il cannot pay lor what it
is not guilty ul with what it ha:; not got. We wonder
it it would not be fair to pay the Arat)S the value
then property had in IH2O (plus allowance for in
flation) before Zionist development and land pur
chases skyrocketed swamp prices not to mention
Jaffa real estate.
We find it surprising that in a seminar on the
Middle East a speaker to present the Israeli position
was not invited.
We sincerely thank the leader for his indulgence.
