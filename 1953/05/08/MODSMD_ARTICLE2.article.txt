# Baseballers Play Broncos, Bears in Important Games
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
So close to the championship
that they can smell nectar and
ambrosia, Stanford's baseball
ers will try to wrap up the
whole gaudy mess this week
end by whipping Santa Clara
and Cal.
The Broncs challenge Everett
Dean's team here at 3:30 today, and
then the Cards tick to Berkeley to
morrow to lock horns with Cal at
2:15.
If the Indians can trounce Cal, the
PCC Southern Division champion
ship is theirs. Right now, the Farm
team has cinched a tic with second
place Cal and USC. In the final four
league games, a combination of one
Stanford win or a loss by Cal and
Southern Cal would be sufficient to
give the league gonfalon to the
Dcanmcn.
Just to complicate in attc r s ,
Stanford is playing in two leagues
at the same time . . . (he PCC
Southern Division and the CIBA.
The CIBA has the same four
teams that the Southern Division
has, plus Santa Clara. A double
sweep this weekend would also
give Stanford the CIBA title.
But it's the Southern Division
championship which is most impor
tant to Dean's men in baseball
knickerbockers. Because the win
ner of the S.D. meets the Northern
Division champion (probably Ore
gon State) for the PCC champion
ship. The PCC victor goes back to
Omaha, Nebraska, for the nationals.
The Cards put their eight-and
three record oti the block today, and
a revenge - minded Santa Clara
comes to town with a four-and-six
mark. The Broncs were the ones
who handed Stanford its first league
