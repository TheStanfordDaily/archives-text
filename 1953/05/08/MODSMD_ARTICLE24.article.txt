freshman tracksters play host to the
Till frosh this afternoon at 3 on the

Stanford will Ite without the
services of "iron man" Jim Tru

were rated heavy favorites, hut
the loss of manpower will make
the meet close, according to Dean.

teams in recent years, is strongest in
the field events, with weightma»
Erick Murray leading the 1 Bear
Cubs.
Bill Hupp and Dave Marriner will
each go in three events in hopes of

heading a Stanford win. Rupp will
do the sprints and the relay, with |
Marriner in the hurdles and broad
jump.
Only record in jeopardy today is 1
the high jump mark of G ft. 4 in. ;
which John Stewart should smash
on the strength of his season's per
formances.
