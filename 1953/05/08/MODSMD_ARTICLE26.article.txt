# Trackmen Travel To Fresno Relays
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
Twenty-four varsity trackmen, one freshman high jumper, two
managers, two coaches, one trainer, and a small contingent of
diehard track addicts venture south and east this Saturday to
ward the desert city of Fresno and the annual Fresno Relays.
There, beneath the lights of Fresno Stadium, the greatest col-

lection of track athletes to invade a
California oval since last year's
Olympic trials will square off in a
combination prep, JC, college, and
independent meet.
Stanford's big chance for the
gold watches should be in the
medley (440, 880, 1.320. mile),
where Fred George, Dave Fetch -
er, Bob Heed, and Bolt Simon will
try and put their best efforts to
gether to beat the fied. Top com
petition will probably come from
California, which is extremely
strong in the middle distances and
adequate in the longer jaunts.
Iron man for the Stanfords will
once more be Robert Bruce Mathias,
boosted by a host of tome-town
travelers from Tulare, who will
make his presence felt in the open
highs, the four-man 440 and 880, the
shot put, and the discus.
Big Bob might find it a bind
breaking the tape in any of these
events, with SC's Davis in the
hurdles, SC's sprint relay team of
Sorgen, Graffio, Wilcox, and Da
vis, SC's Parry O'Brien in the
shot, and SC's Sim Iness and
Parry O'Brien in the discus. In
short, there are gointf to be an
awful lot of gold watches down at
SC come Monday morning.
In the high jump, a well-muscled
freshman who has jumped 6 ft. 6V2
in. name of John Stewart will enter
his specialty unattached (he can't
enter for Stanford, being only a
frosh. Stewart, stiff from two weeks
of spring football practice, will face
the world's toughest high jump com
petition in the form of Olympic
champion Walt Davis (G ft. 10'/2 in.),
Santa Clara Youth Center ace Herm
Wyatt (G ft. 9 7 /« in.), Ken Weisner,
holder of the indoor record at 6 ft.
10%, and Emery Barnes of Oregon
(only 6 ft. 9 in.).
Of interest to Stanford fans, Stan
ford footballer Jim Vick's brother,
Don, will be putting the 12-pound
shot in the prep class. Viek is the
second prep in history to put the
12-pound pill over GO feet, and he
does it consistently. He added a
foot and a half to the prep world
record with a toss of G2 ft. 4 in. He
is G ft. 2 in., 235 pounds, an ex
tremely fine tackle with a B plus
average, and he probably won't go
to Stanford.

Twenty-four varsity trackmen, one freshman high jumper, two
managers, two coaches, one trainer, and a small contingent of
diehard track addicts venture south and east this Saturday to
ward the desert city of Fresno and the annual Fresno Relays.
There, beneath the lights of Fresno Stadium, the greatest col-

lection of track athletes to invade a
California oval since last year's
Olympic trials will square off in a
combination prep, JC, college, and
independent meet.
Stanford's big chance for the
gold watches should be in the
medley (440, 880, 1.320. mile),
where Fred George, Dave Fetch -
er, Bob Heed, and Bolt Simon will
try and put their best efforts to
gether to beat the fied. Top com
petition will probably come from
California, which is extremely
strong in the middle distances and
adequate in the longer jaunts.
Iron man for the Stanfords will
once more be Robert Bruce Mathias,
boosted by a host of tome-town
travelers from Tulare, who will
make his presence felt in the open
highs, the four-man 440 and 880, the
shot put, and the discus.
Big Bob might find it a bind
breaking the tape in any of these
events, with SC's Davis in the
hurdles, SC's sprint relay team of
Sorgen, Graffio, Wilcox, and Da
vis, SC's Parry O'Brien in the
shot, and SC's Sim Iness and
Parry O'Brien in the discus. In
short, there are gointf to be an
awful lot of gold watches down at
SC come Monday morning.
In the high jump, a well-muscled
freshman who has jumped 6 ft. 6V2
in. name of John Stewart will enter
his specialty unattached (he can't
enter for Stanford, being only a
frosh. Stewart, stiff from two weeks
of spring football practice, will face
the world's toughest high jump com
petition in the form of Olympic
champion Walt Davis (G ft. 10'/2 in.),
Santa Clara Youth Center ace Herm
Wyatt (G ft. 9 7 /« in.), Ken Weisner,
holder of the indoor record at 6 ft.
10%, and Emery Barnes of Oregon
(only 6 ft. 9 in.).
Of interest to Stanford fans, Stan
ford footballer Jim Vick's brother,
Don, will be putting the 12-pound
shot in the prep class. Viek is the
second prep in history to put the
12-pound pill over GO feet, and he
does it consistently. He added a
foot and a half to the prep world
record with a toss of G2 ft. 4 in. He
is G ft. 2 in., 235 pounds, an ex
tremely fine tackle with a B plus
average, and he probably won't go
to Stanford.
4x440 — Parsons to Johnson to
Brownsberger to Mathias.
4xBBo — Parsons to Johnson to
Brownsberger to Mathias.
4 x mile—Friedrichs to Ilollister
to Garrett to George.
Medley—George to Fletcher to
Heed to Simon.
Two-mile relay—Simon to Reed
