## 
### 
The mighty Bruin might as well
lie down and play teddy bear to
morrow when he takes on the pow
erful Stanford varsity swimming
team today in the Encina pool at
3:30. The Indians will be out for
their 24th straight dual meet win.

end by 15 points, could produce an
outstanding upset if they can dump
the Indians, who walloped the Tro
jans, 61 -23, two weeks ago.
But after Comparing the talent
of the two clubs,« it seems, if
Coach Tom Ilaynic wanted to, he
could place one - two in every
event with a squad that has scored
380 points in six meets ((>3.3 per
meet) as against 124 (20.K) points
for the opponents.—l). S.
