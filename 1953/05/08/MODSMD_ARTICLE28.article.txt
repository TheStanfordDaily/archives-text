# Frosh Lose, 5-0, Face Cal Tomorrow
## 
### 
After yesterday's scheduled game
with Jefferson High was canceled,
Stanford's freshman team played an
intraschool game against the JV's,
losing by a score of 5-0.
Two Brave hurlers shut out the
freshmen with five hits. The
game was ended after seven in
nings of play. Since the game was
not official, it did not count*as
breaking the frosh II - straight
winning $treak.
Tomorrow the freshmen travel to
Berkeley to attempt to extend their
streak. Kay Young, who will be
trying for his fourth straight vic
tory, is scheduled to go on the
mound for the visitors. Game time
is 10 o'clock.
