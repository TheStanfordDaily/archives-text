## CREW Varsity, JV's, Frosh Face Cal Tomorrow 
### 
Stanford's orphan crew will at
tempt to dethrone mighty Cal when
the two boats splash it out over a
i three-mile grind tomorrow morn-
I ing at 11 in the Yacht Harbor.
Cal's crew is good, but green,

with only one 1952 varsity boater i
returning. Stanford, on the other
hand, can field a more-experienced |
crew and its given its best chance i
in recent years to defeat Cal. A
win would mean the culmination of |
years of building by the self-sup- :
porting crew, for out-rowing Cal is
like toppling Notre Dame in foot
ball.
At 10:30 the second boats will row
three miles, and at 10 the two frosh
bopts will battle it out over a two
mile course.
The freshman boat is especially j

strong for Stanford and is favored
to defeat Cal.
The Yacht Harbor is located at
the end of Embarcadero Road about
three miles northeast of Stanford.
Loudspeaker facilities will keep
spectators informed on the early
parts of the race.
Probable starting lineup for Stan
ford:
Varsity â€” Coxswain, Pete Paup;
stroke, Bill Findlay; 7, Dixon Smith;
6, Ken Lewis; 5. Jerry Thursby; 4,
Phil West; 3, Jerry Thayer; 2, Mor
gan Sanborn; bow, Stan Ijewis.
