# Alumni House One Year Old
## 
### 
The Bowman Alumni House cele- |
brated its first anniversary this j
week.
After one year, in which 125 dif- j
ferent groups and 3,500 people have 1
met within its walls, there has been j
but a single casualtyâ€”a broken ash j
tray.
No rental is asked of official club
groups desiring to meet at the
Alumni House, but they are asked
to clean up any debris after their
meetings. All groups are afforded
the use of furniture, a fully equip
ped modern kitchen, and a fire
place.
Many different groups meet at the
Alumni House; they vary from the
Stanford Club of Palo Alto and the
Federation of American Scientists
to Scabbard and Blade and lIP. !
The largest group to meet at the ,
Alumni House will be a party of
1,000 to be accommodated at the ;
Campus Conference on May 30.
