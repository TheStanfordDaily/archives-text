## 
### 
The fate of Emile Gcrvais will be
dccidcd tonight in the semi-finals
of the Marion Ricc Kirkwood Moot
Court competition.
Eight sccond - year law students
will present their cases to a panel
of local attorneys acting as judges
in the Moot Court, room of the Law
School at 7:30 and 9:15, in an effort
to win a place in the finals of the
annual competition, to be held next
autumn quarter.
The question of Gcrvais' entry
into the U.S. will be debated by the
students, with Oliver Norville, Ros
coe Wilkey, Leonard Ormscth, and
Rolf Westgard representing Gcrvais
and Richard Graham, Louis Saekin,
Robert White, and Richard Konig
representing the District Director
of Immigration and Naturalization.
The government will try to keep
Gcrvais, now being held on Ellis
Island, from entering the U.S. as a
poor security risk.
The competition is held in honor
of Dr. M. R. Kirkwood, who retired
as Dean of the Law School last year.
Students arc judged on the basis
of their briefs, direct testimony, and
ability to think on their feet.
The public is invited to attend.
