# 'Red-Headed Kitten' Wins Con Home Royalty Race

Ho doesn't growl and he
doesn't bite.
But he's the people's choice. ,
"Tiger Dick'' Colbert — the
135-pound red - headed kitten
from the Village—was crowned
Con Home King Friday night
with a record - breaking total
vote of 26,500—5265, in other
words.
Con Home Week profits had j
soared to a record-breaking $8,000
by yesterday afternoon, at least $600
more than last year's record $7,400. j
The new total included over $200 j
net profit from the Sophomore Car- |
nival.
Dick and his Queen, Carol Laz- |
zareschi, Roble brunette, were
crowned by Dean H. Donald Win- j
bigler at the Sophomore Carnival, j
and will serve as Stanford's only j
royalty for the next year.
Where did the $265 come from? j
"Tiger's" campaign managers, an I
energetic group of kids from the j
Village, say they honestly don't |
know. Only $20 came from wing j
funds in Village 308 where he lives.
Only $20 compared with the hun
dreds of dollars other living groups
were assessing for their candidates.
The other $245? Some of it
came from other Village dorms,
some from pcrson-to-person so- j
limitations by the "campaign man- !
agers," but most just from pass
ers-by who were buttonholed and
told about "Tiger Dick."
The catch is—"Tiger Dick" is the
shyest guy in the Village.
He couldn't even make a state
ment for the press. "Aw, shucks,"
he said, and he turned to one of
his campaign managers. "Tell mc
what I should say, Bill."
The most upsetting part of the
whole business for him was the
Con Home Circus Parade in which
candidates had to ride. Bill Ruch,
one of his supporters, swears it
was the only afternoon all quarter
when "Tiger" missed his daily
nap.
Tiger's $265 was over double that
of his nearest competitor, Kappa Sig
Reno Ryan, who garnered 13,000
votes.
Miss Lazzarcschi won her racc
with 19,765 votes. Runner-up was
Nancy Fihe with 14,71f).
Trophies at the Carnival went to
Breakers' roulette table for the most
profitable booth, and the Kappa
Sigs' "frog roulette" for the most
humorous booth.
Complete totals for this year's
Con Home Drive profits will be*
available the end of this week, when
on- and off-campus solicitations arc
completed.
