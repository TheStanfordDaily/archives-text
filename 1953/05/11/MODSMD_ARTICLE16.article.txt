# Springtime Hits Chappie
## 
### 
"Sensual Spring" is the theme of
the Old Hoy's May offering of bud
jokes and pornographic pictures to
the .student body.
Included in thi.s issue, which goes
on sale Wednesday, are the usual
cartoons, art and photo features, and
exchange jokes.
Springtime activities are empha
sized in a special two-page spread
of tlie "Old Hoy's Guide to Beach
Behavior," and ;Â« story of the in nle
view of the mind <>112 a co-ed on .i
"Blind D;*te."
All this, plus parodies on "High
Noon" and Mickey Spillanc, and a
couple of rip-roaring editorials, can
be bought for the ridiculous price of
.'5O cents on Quad, at the Cellar, and
Post OfTice.
