TOKYO, Monday, May ] 1
(UP)â€”The Allies were reported
leaning today toward a compro
mise which would allow a post
armistice political conference
to decide the fate of Korea war
prisoners who refuse to go
home.
The compromise would remove
one of the biggest obstacles to final
agreement on an eight-point Com
munist plan for handling the pris
oners and so bring about, a quick
truce. The Red plan itself wa. a
compromise proposal bowing to
some Allied demands.
The negotiators were scheduled Id
tacklc questions raised by the Corn
munist scheme again today at li
a.m.
Dispatches from the Munsan
trucc .camp said observers be
lieved the Allies would give in
and agree to a final decision 011
unwilling prisoners by the politi
cal conference.
The dispatches said the Alllie.
were expected to demand in return
that a time limit, be placed on how
long the prisoners could bo hold ]
fore a decision is reached at. the
conference. Allied opposition to al
lowing the conference to decide the
POWs' fate was based on the ai
gument that it meant indefinite de
tention of the prisoners and thu .
amounted to a form of forced re
patriation.
LI. Gen. William K. Harrison
unbent slightly from that stand
Sunday. He took a different ap
proaeh to the problem, giving rise
to fhc speculation about a com
promise.
While Harrison .still wa:; arguing
against, the political conference'? dc
cision on the prisoners, his word',
marked an casing of the Allied atti
tude from the previous stand that
such procedure would He unaccept -
able.
He definitely rejejeted that prop
osition soon after the talk:, wee
resumed two weeks ago.
"It is logical," he said, "that we
could readily reach some agreement
here which would provide for a
definite final decision in tho case of
each prisoner without further nego
tiations in a political conference.
