# bookstore vs. Gitl Shop

### 
Outside of his professors, a student has one
main source of information and ideas. That
source is his books.
Jt seems to us, then, that the vital elements
in the plant of any well-equipped university
are two: a well-stocked library and a well
stocked bookstore. In analyzing the situation
at Stanford, it is the adequacy of the second
of these elements which we question.
The Stanford Bookstore is well stocked, all
right. But not with books. Instead, it offers us
teddy bears, earrings, and monogrammed T
shirts. Upon entering the store, one walks by

I
a vast outlay of gifts and knickknacks before
even entering the general book department.
The book department, incidentally, uses fewer
display tables and occupies less floor space
than the gift department.
We don't object to the existence of a gift
shop on campus. It is a popular feature and
evidently fulfills a student need. But we do
object when a gift shop exists at the expense
of a book supply center. For then it prohibits
the quality and quantity of a main source of
a student's education. â€”Sue Wheat
