## The
						Nashashibi Lecture 
### 
'Reasoned I)is<*ussioir
To the Editor:
Mr. Anwar Nashashibi's Tuesday Evening address,
as reported in the Daily ol May (5, 1953, was full of
complete misinterpretation of historical fact. Inas
much as the Daily reported on this speech (which
concerns a very controversial subject) without edi
torial comment, I feel that an effolt should be made
to present a more factual recital of recent affairs in
the Middle East.
Although I was unable to attend Mr. Nashashibi's
talk, I write willi some knowledge of the situation.
My father is president of the American Jewish
Committee which for many years has been working
with the State Department and the United Nations
toward settlements of outstanding Middle East
problems which will be fair to both the Arab
States and to Israel. I have visited the Middle East
—in after the creation of the State of Israel
—and am familiar with some of these matters from
first-hand knowledge.*
It is true that Great Britain, during the term of its
mandate over Palestine, acted as though the region
were part of its "sphere of influence." It is not true
that the British were "particularly concerned with
the establishment of a Zionish state." Quite the con
trary—Britain did everything that it could to pre
vent the establishment of Israel (which is a demo
cratic state, not a Zionist state), and the new country
was established on the day that England withdrew
its political anil fhilitary control over Palestine, which
it diil voluntarily after being unable to work out any
other solution for the area.
Partition of Palestine into two states was decided
upon by the United Nations. The Arabs refused to
accept this decision. Israel took it upon itself to en
force the U.N. decision by setting up its own govern
ment in the area which the United Nations had de
cided should be Jewish-controlled. Whereupon the
.seven Arab nations of the area banded together and
invaded Israel starting the now-famous Arab-Israeli
war which Israel conclusively won despite having
less than one-tenth the manpower of her combined
enemies. Since that time, both sides have wrongly
refused to obey certain U.N. recommendations and
although an armistice exists, there is no assurance
of permanent peace in the area.
it is not true that, during the war, "millions of
Arabs were made homeless and that acres of prop
erty were confiscated." The latter part of this state
ment is sheer nonsense. It is true that there are
Arab refugees resulting from the war, and were
the Arab nations now willing to negotiate a real
peace with Israel, Israel has indicated its willingness
to do its part to repatriate such of these people as
want to return to their original homes. Many do not.
The thousands of Arabs now living in Israel are
happier than they ever were under Arab, Turkish,
or British rule. They enjoy full citizenship as do
all non-Jewish citizens of the community.
Real problems exist in the Middle East and it is
to be hoped that solutions can be found which will
be fair to all parties. As Americans, of course, our
principal interest is to make certain that this vital
area of the world continues its friendship to the
Western allies. Td this end, the creation of Israel
as a democracy—the only real democracy in the
area has had a most salutary effect.
Reasoned discussion of the problems is a necessity.
It is to be regretted that Mr. Nashashibi took an ex
tremist position. I have tiied not to do so in this
letter and hope that I have succeeded.

Crocs vs. (wilors
To the Editor:
I wish to report a most disturbing error in one of
the Daily's advertisements.
1 refer to the Wildroot Cream-Oil ad in la«t Wed
nesday's paper. The ad displayed an extremely ad
mirable portrait of a member of the genus alligator,
but the caption was quite misleading. It is true that
a few references were made to 'gators, but the over
all article seemed to imply that the individual pic
tured was a crocodile. For example, an alligator
does not shed "crocodile tears" (for that matter,
neither does a crocodile).
I feel that such untruths can cause much ill will
and that misconceptions of this sort are detrimental
to a university's goal of teaching its students to seek
the truth.
I hope that in the future the Daily will be more
careful in its selection of material, be it in the adver
tising columns or elsewhere.

Why the Fuss?
To the Editor:
It seems to us that Mr. Nashashibi's talk in the
Tuesday Evening Series was really a "cinch." It
disturbed both the editor and the Israelites on the
campus. We felt quite elated when we read the Fri
day editorial entitled, "International Issues: Both
Sides" and the letter to the editor entitled, "Re Nash
ashibi." To us, both the editorial and the letter are
good indicators of the success that Nashashibi has
had in presenting the Arab viewpoint. Yet we would
like to make the following comments:
First. Mr. Nashashibi was not here to express
ideas which are propaganda harangue. He was in
vited, thanks to the people who invited him, to
describe the condition of the Arab refugees and ex
press the current feelings of the 45 million Arabs in
the Near East towards the U.S.A. He did not Hat
ter. He did not beg. There was nothing new to the
Americans in what he said. A million Arabs were
chased from their homeland after being robbed of
their properties, not by purchase, but by hook,
crook, and force. They are living in misery, and
Russia is utilizing them as a weapon against the
West to propagate communism in the Middle East.
Second, the Americans who fought in Europe and
Asia know that one of the biggest problems to an
army is the rushing of refugees to its lines. Whom,
then, are the Israelites deceiving by writing that
the refugees were told by their leaders to leave Pal
estine for a two weeks vacation? It is the atrocities of
the Zionists, for sure, that explain the exodus. "Be
ware of the oppressed, once he is armed." The Jews
had been oppressed and persecuted everywhere. When
some of them were given the chance, they avenged
themsefves savagely of humanity and the Arabs were
the scapegoats.
Third, when Nashashibi estimated the Arabs' prop
erty loss for $10 billion, he was very modest. It is
fascinating to watch Zionists count and divide this
amount in dimes, nickles and cents and then report
sarcastically that the sum will amftunt to $11,000
per refugee woman, baby, or beggar. Take it easy,
people, and set your hearts at peace. Palestine has
never been homeland- for the Zionists to value its
preciousness. A whole country was lost. Don't you
think that it is worth $10 billion? Well, if this is
the case, thank you. We realize now that you will
not feel too bad when the great Exodus comes to
pass. It is a country that is not worth $10 billion to
you.
Fourth, the people who listened to Nashashibi ap
preciated his honesty and really sympathized with
him. This has stirred up the deep rooted anxiety
of the Zionist students. One day, many people
thought that the establishment of a state for the
Jens would help them gain security. They have
got a state, lias this wiped out the prejudice against
them?
Has this given them the security and self-assurance
they need? No. They were threatened by one speech
given by one man. After he finished his speech, they
followed him to the green room supposedly to ask
questions. They did not. They attempted to ridicule,
abuse, and attack-him in public. They had to be re
minded that Stanford's prestige was at stake and the
speaker should be respected. The next day at the
seminar the same thing happened again. Mr. Nas
hashibi was a gentleman and the moderator was
very permissive. It is very surprising that they write
that no speaker to present the Israeli position was
invited.
It is more surprising that the editor echoed their
complaint and this exposed him. We couldn't help
but feel, as many others did, that he was biased and
unjustly siding with them. They were given the
chance to argue with the speaker. That they didn't
utilize it adequately is nobody's fault. They want an
outside Zionist to be invited. Do you think that he
would do a better job?
Furthermore, haven't the Zionists got a better
chance in the U.S.A. through the press, the broad
cast, the government, and the lobbies? The editor
himself recognizes the fact that the Arab viewpoint
has ben sadly ignored in this country for the past
several years. Why the fuss? It was only one man
and one speech.
Finally, we do not intend to start a political bout
about a problem we believe that its solution is in
our hands. It is not the U.S.A. that will solve the
problem for us. She has disappointed us. It is not
the U.N.O. because we have lost faith in it. The
Zionists have won the first round. Good for them.
Anyway, the winner in the first round is not always
the winner in the last one. History is repeating it
self. Once upon a time, the Crusaders went to Pales
tine to establish a state.
