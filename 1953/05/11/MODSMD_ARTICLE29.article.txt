# Humanities Degrees Offered Graduates
## 
### 
A new kind of doctoral degree in humanities designed to
broaden the training of college and university instructors in
certain liberal arts fields will be offered to Stanford University
graduate students this fall, according to an announcement last
week by President Wallace Sterling. •
The program is a pioneer venture in postgraduate education.

It has been set up for an eight-year ♦
period under a grant of $250,1)00 |
from The Fund for the Advance
ment oi Education, an independent j
corporation established in 1951 by
the Ford Foundation.
The giant will permit at least five
honors fellowships in humanities of
$2,000 each to be awarded annually.
A distinguished visiting professor
will also be appointed for each of
the first five years to lead special
seminar courses of the program.
Dr. Henry Alonzo Myers, profes
sor of English at Cornell University,
has been appointed as visiting pro
fessor in humanities for the first
year. He has been a leader in post
war curriculum revisions at Cor
nell, and has a wide background in
philosophy, literature, and drama as
well as in English.
The program will he adminis
tered by a committee in charge of
the Graduate Honors Program in
Humanities, headed by Professor
John W. Dodds of the English De
partment. Professor F. W. Stroth
mann has been appointed director
of the program, which has been in
preparation for three years.
Committee members are Profes
sors Hubert C. Heffner of speech
and drama, John L. Mothershead Jr.
oi philosophy, F. W. Strothmann of
Germanic and Romanic languages,
Virgil K. Whitaker of English, Phil
ip W. Harsh of classics, and George
H. Knoles of history.
The committee members repre- !
sent the six departments which will
participate in the program. Doctor
al degrees will be awarded jointly
with one of the departments by con
ferring a degree of "Ph.D. in His
tory and Humanities," or "Ph.D. in
English and Humanities," etc.
Specialized study in one of the
six fields will remain almost as 1
intensive as ever. Pai t of the aim
is to train college instructors who ;
will be fully qualified to do teach
ing and research in a depart
mental field.
But in addition the student will
enter specially planned courses in
tended to familiarize him with the j
stream of Western thought as a i
whole.
Implementing this aim will be a
special series of "Western Tradi- ,
tion" courses devoted to reading and
interpretation of the world's signifi
cant thinkers, from Plato to the I
moderns. A seminar series will ex
plore current intellectual trends
and their relation to liberal educa
tion and the university.
One year of graduate work in
the student's chosen field is a pre
requisite for acceptance, and he

will continue studies in this spe
cialty during the following two
years of academic work.
