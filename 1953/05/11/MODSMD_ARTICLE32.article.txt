# Cal, Bronc Baseballers Slug Sagging Stanfords
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford's baseballers took it on
the lug twice this weekend, and yet
moved through the back door a
notch closer to the PCC Southern
Division championship.
The nine suffered its most disas
trous weekend, dropping the duke
to Santa Clara, 5 to 2, in ten innings
and then playing dead before Cal
on Saturday, (i to 3.
However, Stanford surreptitiously
sneaked through the servants' en
trance closer to the title as UCLA
humbled Cal on Friday, thus extin
guishing the Bears' mathematical
chances of tying Stanford.
Southern Cal is now the only
team that has a chance to tie the
Indians. If the Trojans beat UCLA
in their one remaining PCC game
and if the Indians lose twice to Cal
next weekend, Southern Cal will be
tied with Everett Dean's team and
will probably demand a play-off.
Stanford, behind for eight and a
half innings on Friday, scored twice

in the ninth to draw out their exe
cution. With the bases loaded, third
baseeman Ray Swarts smacked a
screaming double into left, chasing
in Warren Goodrich and Jack Shep
ard.
Chuck Essegian barreled home,
trying to beat two perfectly exe
cuted throws from left fielder Dick
Camilli and shortstop A 1 Bertagna.
Santa Clara's overweight catcher,
Ray Modena, received tha ball and
awaited Essegian's attack at the
plate.
Essegian cracked into Modena
with the full force of his well
muscled 200 pounds, but Modena
retained the ball for the out. That
ended Stanford's chance to win, as
in the next inning the Broncos ex
ploded for three runs to sew up the
affair.
On Saturday, it was again a story
of too little and too late. Behind
6 to 0, the Indians came up to 6 to 3
in the eighth and ninth.
