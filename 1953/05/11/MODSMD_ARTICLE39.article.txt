### DICK MALTZMAN 
That old devil Trojan fought his
way through the wind and cold of
ne Fresno Relays to nose out Stan
ford in the last event of the day,
the mile relay, by a scant 'iVz points.
Jp to that point, Stanford was lead
ing by a point and a half. Final
count was USC 66 : !4, Stanford 63V4
in the open class, and USC 55, Stan
ford 45 in the college class.
But the track fans crowded into
Rateliffe Stadium weren't watching
the point count; their eyes were on
the individual performances going
on below them.
Outstanding of these was the
effort of one Mr. Parry O'Brien,
shot putter extraordinaire, who
shattered the previous world rec
ord of 58 ft. 10 1 in. set by Jim
Fuchs three years ago by two
inches, 55) ft. :| 4 in.
For Stanford, it was a case of tak
ing the seconds and thirds. The
Stanfords scored points in every
event except the 5,000-meter, the
broad jump, pole vault, and the high
jump. In the high jump, Stanford
'freshman John Stewart kept the
Stanford colors present by clearing
6 ft. 41/2 in. — good for a tie for
fourth. ; .
Stanford sprin'tdr Browns
be rger ran a sizzling 9.7 century
which was good for a fourth and
enough to beat Graffio of SC and
Blackburn of Cal.
Jack Davis ran a best-ever race,
with the wind behind him, to take
the 120 highs in 13.6 —a tenth of a
second off the world's record. In
second place was Bob Mathias,

clocked in 14.1. Jerry Wood clob
bered a hurdle and finished out of
the money.
The Farm team collected four
gold watches in the medley relay
(440, BSO, 1,320, mile) as the team
of Fred George, Dave Fletcher,
Boh Keed. and Bob Simon took a
second behind the L.A. Athletic
Club in the open class and a first
in the collegiate class (under the
screwball system of dual scoring
used).
In the sprint relays, Stanford's
anchor Man, Bob Mathias, lost sec
ond - place spot twice by scarce
inches. In the 440, it was Laing of
Fresno State, winner of the hun
dred, who pulled down the big man
to nip him at the wire.
Stanford's only other gold watch
came in the javelin, where Leo
Long's 211 ft. 5 in. was only good
enough for fourth in the open class,
but took first in the collegiate class.
Howie Hertz placed second be
hind O'Brien's record performance
with a best of 53 ft. 4 in. In the
discus, Chuck Renfro took a third
behind Fortune Gordien and Leon
Patterson (SC frosh) and ahead of
Sim Iness (sore leg) and Bob Ma
thias (three fouls) in that order.
