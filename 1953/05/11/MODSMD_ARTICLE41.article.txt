Did you kill the lion.' the Dean asked incredulously.
Sine did! , said C.liarlie. l> I here 1 was, walking to class. It
was pretty hot, but 1 didn't mind because 1 was wearing a
cool, comfortable Van Heusen Van Dual Shirt with short
es. I hat smart collar looked swell with my school tie.
And imagine, 1 only paid $3.95 for this swell shirt!"
"But what about the lion?", asked the Dean.
"Well, all of a sudden." continued Charlie; "this fugitive
from a circus leaps out from behind a tree and growls at me.
'1 his was no spot to be wearing a dress shirt, 1 decided, so I
whipped off my tie, opened my collar, and presto!- rny
Van Dual became the best-looking, most comfortable sport
shirt on campus. Now 1 was ready for action."
"Yes," said the Dean.
"So 1 shoved my trusty right arm down his throat, grabbed
his tail . . . and pulled him inside out!"
"My word!", said the Dean.
"Lefty" Jones graduated Cum Laude last term.

his tail . . . and pulled him inside out!"
"My word!", said the Dean.
