"Girls are violating it right
and left!"
"Why shouldn't a girl go into
a fraternity house alone to
hang up an election poster?"
"What's a girl supposed to
do when her date goes inside
lo get a coat stand outside in
the rain?"
Tlic.se arc the kind of comments j
which have been hurtling back and
forth for years every time anyone
mentioned the "lone woman rule."
They're the kind of arguments—vio
lations, inconvenience, doubtful va
lidity—that resulted in the pressure
for changing the rule.
The pressure for change eulmi

nated last week when AWS Board
approved a "lone woman rule" com

mittec recommendation that the
regulation be made into a standard
of conduct. A vote by the women
.students plus Excom's approval is
required before the change can go
into effect.
The recent drive for change !«• -
gait more than two years ago,
when the Fundamental Standard
Committee started mulling over
the problem of the rule's viola
tion.
Junk the rule entirely was their
first thought. Then they began to
talk to both student and adminis
tration proponents of the "lone
woman" principle.
The administration asked what
they'd do when someone phoned in
and inquired, "I've noticed a girl
from Stanford entering a man's
apartment late at night. Do you con
done that kind of conduct?" They
maintained a rule was necessary to
show the kind of conduct expected
of Stanford women—and especially
to act as a guidepost for the girls
themselves.
This was the problem AWS's
special committee faced when it
took over the problem last fall. A
living group survey' last spring in

dicated Stanford women wanteil
the rule changed —or done away
with. A suggestion was to set up
hours of permissible entrance —
perhaps comparable to the closing
hours in women's residences.
Last fall tlio whole problem be
came the responsibility of six center
women: Joyce Ballantine (chair
man), Joan Coldren, Joanne Hixson,
Kilbee Cormack, Dorothy Dodge,
and Carol Roselyn.
They faced the pros and eons and
realized that the rule could not be
omitted entirely from the Women's
Social Regulations. They also be
lieved that special hours would be
unenforceable.
Their solution: to put new em
phasis on the Fundamental Stand
ard in the "lone woman" situation—
and to deal with the subject in a
standard of conduct included in the
Social Regulations.
They decided the "standard"
would serve as the best compro
mise. It would provide the guide
post and the reference for the ad
ministration. At the same time* it
would permit a girl to use her
own judgment about entering a
man's residence in reasonable sit
uations.
With their report, the committee
suggested that the followipj^jpints

be stressed in orientation:
1. That this new individual re
sponsibility "would not mean indi
vidual license"—that the girl would
have the added duty of making a
thoughtful choice instead of just
following a rule.
2. That "the symbol factor of a
lone woman entering a man's resi
dence cannot be ignored"—especial
ly in oil-campus and after-dark sit
uations.
!5. That "third-person responsibil
ity should be stressed to help in
crease respect for the standard."
4. "It is desirable to stimulate
discussion in order to define and set
up standards of conduct appropriate
for Stanford women."
