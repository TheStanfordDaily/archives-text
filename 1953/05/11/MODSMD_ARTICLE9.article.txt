## 
### JERRY SIMPSON 
Gin flows freely, gorgeous
fandango girls snuggle closer
to tipsy miners, and gold nug
gets are tossed onto the stage

land), tent show actress, takes
her bow before the audience in
Ram's Head's annual Spring
Show, "Frisco '49."

Thursday, Friday, and Saturday in
Memorial Auditorium at 8:15.
Flora Malone's tent, show was a
center of night life in San Francisco
in the days when everyone was
ready, willing, and able; when a man
j was a real he-man and a woman was
a woman. In those gay, wicked, and
j far-off day, a gal didn't have to do
; much chasing to catch her man if
she took advantage of the 75 t«» 1
ratio of gents to ladies. For some
I strange reason the miners of the
town don't seem to go for this set
j up and they enter into some des
perate planning of how to entice
women to come from the States to
j help them spend their dough and
j to spire up the daily life in a drab
| mining town.
Jim Fenway (Raymond llam
mrl), a wandering sailor, proves
to be quite attraetivc to Flora Ma
lone ami she la>s her plans to
trap him intH%iiatrimony. By build
ing a dream house that Jim has
described in one of his weaker
and dreamier moods. Flora hopes
to persuade him to settle down to
living on Signal Hill.

tions. and in a heart-tugging melody
tells her that her plan has failed
