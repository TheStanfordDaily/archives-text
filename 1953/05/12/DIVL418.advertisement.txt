Hear Bill Powell Tonight!
Here is your chance to hear Bill Powell, star halfback of the Cali
fornia football team for the last two years, who will be here tonight
in order to explain what Christianity has meant to him as a campus
leader. Though many people would claim that Christianity has no
place in the life of any thinking, reasonable student, Bill Powell is
among the first to explain that this belief is not true when put to
the test and he himself beieves that Christianity is just as practical
and applicable to every student on campus as it is for him, a football
player and campus leader. He will be speaking and answering ques
tions tonight in the main lounge o* the Women's Clubhouse at
7:30 p.m. and would like to see and speak to as many of you as
possible. (This meeting is sponsored by the Stanford Christian
Fellowship.)
