# 'FRISCO '49' NOTES
## Is Show Broadway-Bound? 
### JERRY SIMPSON 
An air of quiet determination
and a feeling that "this show is
i headed for the top" pervades
the atmosphere on the stage
and drifts into the wings of
Mem Aud as Director Hal Bur
; dick Ir. and the cast of "Frisco
'49" put the finishing touches
on the annual Spring Show, to
be produced on Thursday, Fri
day, and Saturday at 8:15.
Co-author Ted Marcu.se revealerl
yesterday that Hollywood has labeled
"Frisco 49" as definitely having
Broadway possibilities and that tal
ent scouts and producers are keep
ing a hawk eye on activities in Mem
Aud on opening night of the show.
The Ram's Head office is buzzing
with rumors and one of the most in
teresting of these is that the glamour
i city of the world is to be represented
in the persons of representatives of
MGM. Paramount, and Columbia
studios. Hollywood wants to see at
I first hand the merits of the show.
' Several local big-wigu aibo have

wind of (he big things down Stan
ford way. The manager of the
fJeary and Curran theaters in the
City is to join the audience at Mem
Aud this weekend to sec what he
thinks of the show.
Terrence O'Flaherty of the Chron
icle in his Radio and TV Column has
this to say after seeing a rehearsal
of the show. "This is a musical show
we II be hearing a lot of. Hollywood
has wind of it already and so have
several local backers, ft has more hot
hit tunes than anything since 'Okla
homa.' "
When Marcusc was asked ]soint
blank why he thought the show was
Broadway-bound he said: "The show
was originally written for the Broad
way stage and the time is now ripe
to offer my work to Holywood anrl
New York producers." The music
for the show was written by David
Hughes. At the time of the writing,
Hughes lacked a usable dialogue to
accompany the music and tic the
show together.
Here is where Marcusc enters
the picture. In the words of Mar
cusc, "I was practically duty-hound
to write the story." When a group
of piuduccr* in New York saw the

srripl they announced a heart
warming verdict to Marc-use. "This
is the best and only script we have
seen for seven years which is suit
able for this or any similar story."
Unfortunately, when the show was
completed, another show, "Paint.
Your Wagon" had just openr<l on
Broadway concerning the .same .sub
ject but written in a different mood
and manner. So Marcu.se and Hughes
sat back to watch the results. The
outcome of the show was far beyond
their wildest dreams. When the show
played in Chicago, it folded in live
nights, the cue for Ma reuse and
Mud >es to shift into Ifigh gear.
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday
nights will determine the fate of this
anxious wait.
Having appeared with such stars
as Tallulah Bankhcad. Kathcrinc
Cornell, and Judith Anderson,
Marcusc seems to he well qualified
to view the posibilities of the show
objectively.
Tickets for the production may be
purchased at Engineering corner,
the Peninsula Box Office, Stanford
Players' Box Office, or at Ram's
Head Office. Prices are $1.20, 90
ccnts and 60 ccnts.
