# Lindbergh Finds Cave
## 
### 
Jon Lindbergh, 20-year-old marine
biology major here at Stanford, last
Saturday swam 150 feet tinder wa
ter to discover what is believed
might be one of the largest under
water chambers in the west.
The discovery was made when
Lindbergh and two other members
of the Western Speleological Insti
tute were exploring Bower Cave, in
Mariposa County near Yosemitc.
Attached to the swimmer, who
wore swim fins and an aqualung,
was a thin nylon line paid out by
Dick Irvine, student at San Fran
cisco State College.
According to a copyrighted Oak
land Tribune story, Lindbergh made
two dives into the caves, the first
time carrying a small rubber boat,
and the second time carrying a flash
camera wrapped in a waterproof
bag.
Irvine held the line for over an
hour on Lindbergh's second dive.
Most of this time the young explorer
was in the boat groping his way
around the cave.
Within the cave, Lindbergh dove
to a depth of 125. feet.
