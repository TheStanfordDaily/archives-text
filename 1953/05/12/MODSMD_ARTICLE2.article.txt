# STANFORD—TODAY AND TOMORROW
## Faulkner Tackles Queries About Faculty Problems 
### BARBARA TUERK 
Fewer than a dozen students showed up for last night's "Stan
ford Today and Tomorrow" talk at Stern Hall, but they kept
Ray Faulkner, Acting Dean of the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, busy a full' two hours answering a wide range of gues
tions concerning all aspects of his subject, "Academics."

The talk was the second to be |
scheduled in Stern Hall within the
past four weeks.
One of the first questions to come
up was: "How are faculty salaries
determined?"
"There is no linn measure of
salaries," answered Or. Faulkner,
who lias spent the past few months
trying to budget expenses for the
many departments in his school.
'"Men who are leaders, creative re
searchers. good teachers, good citi
zens (and I must admit., sought by
other institutions) get higher sal
aries, of course," he explained.
"Within a given department all the
full professors do not receive the
same amount."
Dr. Faulkner pointed out that emi
nent people in certain fields are in
greater demand than those in other
fields. "For instance," he said,
"teachers in physics, math, and
chemistry can step out any day into
industrial jobs with fancy pay."
The dean agreed that Stanford's
search for the best men may be
hindered by its low salary scale.
"But nevertheless," he said, "I
think the caliber of our teachers
is as high as that of any univer
sity in the country."
Administratively, Stanford has al
most complete departmental autono
my, he pointed out.
He said that faculty salaries and
promotions are decided by the Dean
and the President, after recommen
dations are received from the head
of each department, working with j
the senior men in the department.
"In curriculum, too," the dean |
added, "there's no committee to tell
a department what it can do. This
may lead to excesses and extremes
sometimes, but on the other hand, it
gives great flexibility."
Appointing new teachers is the
third major responsibility of each
department. "There is no orderly
central clearinghouse where we
we can look for new teachers,"
Dr. Faulkner explained. "It's just
a search. VVe somctimbs have to
cifllert records of 20 men before |
>ve can appoint someone to one
job."
"The easiest way to fjnd new men,"
he said, "is to get them from an
other school."
He admitted in answer to a ques

tion that that would bring rivalries.
"With Cal, for instance," he elab
orated. "we have a long-standing
agreement that after a man has ten
ure we won't offer him another job
without consulting the president."
"That often brings a raise in his
salary," he smiled.
Dr. Faulkner felt very strongly
that many faculty members would
like to rcplacc the quarter system
with the semester system, and to
institute some whole year courses.
"It'd be a lot less expensive, of
course," he said. "The paper we use
under this system is enormous, to
say nothing of time. It seems we
just, get finished with pre-registering
when we're registering all over again
for the next quarter."
The dean questioned whether stu
dents would like to decide in the
fall what they would be taking next
May. The problem of having exams
falling after vacations was also men
tioned in the discussion.

'"Men who are leaders, creative re
searchers. good teachers, good citi
zens (and I must admit., sought by
other institutions) get higher sal
aries, of course," he explained.
"Within a given department all the
full professors do not receive the
same amount."
Dr. Faulkner pointed out that emi
nent people in certain fields are in
greater demand than those in other
fields. "For instance," he said,
"teachers in physics, math, and
chemistry can step out any day into
industrial jobs with fancy pay."
The dean agreed that Stanford's
search for the best men may be
hindered by its low salary scale.
"But nevertheless," he said, "I
think the caliber of our teachers
is as high as that of any univer
sity in the country."
Administratively, Stanford has al
most complete departmental autono
my, he pointed out.
He said that faculty salaries and
promotions are decided by the Dean
and the President, after recommen
dations are received from the head
of each department, working with j
the senior men in the department.
"In curriculum, too," the dean |
added, "there's no committee to tell
a department what it can do. This
may lead to excesses and extremes
sometimes, but on the other hand, it
gives great flexibility."
Appointing new teachers is the
third major responsibility of each
department. "There is no orderly
central clearinghouse where we
we can look for new teachers,"
Dr. Faulkner explained. "It's just
a search. VVe somctimbs have to
cifllert records of 20 men before |
>ve can appoint someone to one
job."
"The easiest way to fjnd new men,"
he said, "is to get them from an
other school."
He admitted in answer to a ques

tion that that would bring rivalries.
"With Cal, for instance," he elab
orated. "we have a long-standing
agreement that after a man has ten
ure we won't offer him another job
without consulting the president."
"That often brings a raise in his
salary," he smiled.
Dr. Faulkner felt very strongly
that many faculty members would
like to rcplacc the quarter system
with the semester system, and to
institute some whole year courses.
"It'd be a lot less expensive, of
course," he said. "The paper we use
under this system is enormous, to
say nothing of time. It seems we
just, get finished with pre-registering
when we're registering all over again
for the next quarter."
The dean questioned whether stu
dents would like to decide in the
fall what they would be taking next
May. The problem of having exams
falling after vacations was also men
tioned in the discussion.

Fewer than a dozen students showed up for last night's "Stan
ford Today and Tomorrow" talk at Stern Hall, but they kept
Ray Faulkner, Acting Dean of the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, busy a full' two hours answering a wide range of gues
tions concerning all aspects of his subject, "Academics."

The talk was the second to be |
scheduled in Stern Hall within the
past four weeks.
One of the first questions to come
up was: "How are faculty salaries
determined?"
"There is no linn measure of
salaries," answered Or. Faulkner,
who lias spent the past few months
trying to budget expenses for the
many departments in his school.
