Wilson diseased plans today
to slash monthly draft calls by
50 per cent and to cut the pro
jected strength of the armed
forces by at least 291,000 men.
Wilson saic) draft calls in the next
fiscal year will be cut in half. Based
on recent calls of about 50.000 men
a month, this would mean future
calls will average about 25,000 men
a month.
He said the overall uniformed
strength of the military service:;
will be reduced to 3,356,000 by Juno
30, 1954, if the Korean war contin
ues. An additional 56,000 will be cut
off if hostilities cease, he said.
Wilson's figure compares with a
military manpower, goal of 3,647,000
proposed in the Truman budget and
a current actual strength of 3,515,000
men and women.
He said that a review by the
Defense Department made it "per
fectly clear" that the Truman ad
ministration goals could not be at
tained "within the concept of a rea
sonable balance between federal ex
penditures and revenues." '
