# Allies Turn Down Red Truce Plan
## 
### 
TOKYO, Tuesday, May 12 (UPJ
Allied negotiators shied away from
a Communist truce plan today on
grounds that it. only put. off the
problem of voluntary repatriation
without providing a final solution.
A new deadlock was developing
over the eventual fate of war pris
oners unwilling to go home. The
eight - point Red scheme merely
postponed the final decision until a
post-armistice political conference.
Lit. Gen. William K. Harrison was
expected to ask the Reds more ques
tions starting at 11 a.m. today (7
p.m. PDT Monday). He was trying
to pin them down on the end prod -
uct of their peace plan.
Lt. Gen. Nam II stood on his cov
er-all answer that the basic pnn
ciplos of throwing the prisoner
problem to a political conference
must be reached before any specific
details could lie settled.
The Allies wanted to know what
would become of the prisoners op
posed to repatriation after their fate
had gone to the political confer
ence. Harrison told Nam:
"Being realistic, we have recog
nized the fact that there can be no
guarantee that the political confei
etice, will hp able to settle this prob
lem."
