In the change*ol the "lone woman" rule, we
see a real step forward in women's social reg
ulations at Stanford.
On a campus noted for its liberal, sensible
social regulations the rule that it is "not ac
ceptable for a woman to be in a man's resi
dence, except in the company of at least one
other woman," seemed to us and hundreds
of other coeds familiar with its inconveniences
a singularly Victorian one.
Under the proposed change, the act of en
tering a man's residence becomes "in itself
neither acceptable nor unacceptable." The
woman faced with the. situation is on her
own to judge the acceptability of the act.
We commend the work of the Fundamental
Standard Committee and the group of women

students who formulated the proposal, first, for
their thoughtful, thorough study of the prob
lem, and second, for coming up with a sen
sible, realistic recommendation.
We especially applaud a basic assumption
of the proposed change â€” the assumption
that a Stanford woman has the judgment
and integrity to make her own decision
when a guestionable social situation con
fronts her.
But the proposed change is not law yet. To
become effective, "it needs the approval of
Excom this Wednesday night and the affirma
tive vote of women students in house meet
ings Monday night. .
