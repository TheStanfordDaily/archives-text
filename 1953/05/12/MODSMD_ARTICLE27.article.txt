A Bull K" iont-r likes to get a new slant, a new
angle from which to write about Stanford. That's why
I gut up at the crack of dawn yesterday. 1 wanted to

see what kind of a story the early
mornin Stanford could tell the
Stanford that was just beginning
to throw off it;; bed covers.
First, I drove out to the foot
ball stadium and climbed to the
top bench. The flaming ball of
sun was just beginning to peek
through the opening in the south
east tnd. 1 remember times when
S'U.OOO posteriors had edged into
the IK!..";00 seats, when the bellows

i.tii , avcua, witru mc ucuuwa
of the hawkers could be heard above the din of the
crowd, and when the whole crowd had risen as one
person to watch a spectacular play. But now the
ghostly stadium was dead silent, and only little drop
lets of dew covered the benches.
SI the Stadium could break the great muteness,
what a story il could tell! It could boast about the
great footballers who had dug their cleats into its
so t, clean turf — the Nevers, the Ciraysons, the
Standlecs, the Alberts, the McColls.
Next, I went to Lake Lag. This was an entirely
different lake than the afternoon Lake Lag. This
wasn t the caricature ol a lake that everyone kidded
about the lake of choppy waves, murky waters,
and many insects.
No, this was a lake of majestic beauty. The gentle,
vivid green loothills in • the background and the
bushy trees tljat lined the shore were mirrored ex
quisitely in its motionless waters. Two ducks cast
their reflection in the giant looking glass as they
w< pt over the water and then out of sight.
I lelt Lake Lag and walked up and down the

Row. It was the same How you see at any other
time of the day—only without tl\e volleyball frames,
the front-lawn games of catch, the kids exchanging
"hello's" as they pass friends on the sidewalk, and
the rattletraps puttering down the street.
Five or six robins, all in good voice, were sitting
on the top of a massive black car in front of Stillman.
One of them Hew over to the Alpha Delt lawn,
plucked out a fat, wriggly worm, and then winged
off before any of his friends could come to share
the spoils.
112 walked past the Union and the Cellar, where the
aroma of frying bacon tingled my nostrils, and on
through the inner Quad. The bright early morning
sun gave a new glory to the Biblical figures on the
Mem Church mosaic.
I passed the many empty classrooms. By the time
the sun had set, students would have absorbed
24,000 hours of knowledge in those rooms.
1 walked to the Main Libe lawn and eased myself
down on the grass. Possibly this was the best van
tage point to see the early morning Stanford. Rising
above the massive oak tree was Hoover Tower, a
poem of symmetry and strength in its early morning
brilliance. Only the incessant chattel' of the birds as
they flitted to and from their nests under the Cub
berley roof disturbed the As I sat there
watching the sun climb higher, everything smelled
fresh and clean and good.
It was getting late now. The 10-minutes-to-8 bell
sounded. In the distance I heard the whistle of a
commuter train. Any minute now, a swarm of stu
dentts would come down from the Row—girls in
crisp cotton dresses, boys in blue denims and Ha
waiian shirts. And for a moment, a fleeting moment,
I wished that I was a great poet or artist so that I
could capture the whole picture in immortal rhyme
or a never-to-he-forgotten painting.
Soon the sleeping giant would be a vibrant, pul
sating Stanford, and the tranquility would be lost.
I looked once more at the peaceful picture, then
turned, and slowly walked to class.

the rattletraps puttering down the street.
Five or six robins, all in good voice, were sitting
on the top of a massive black car in front of Stillman.
One of them Hew over to the Alpha Delt lawn,
plucked out a fat, wriggly worm, and then winged
off before any of his friends could come to share
the spoils.
112 walked past the Union and the Cellar, where the
aroma of frying bacon tingled my nostrils, and on
through the inner Quad. The bright early morning
sun gave a new glory to the Biblical figures on the
Mem Church mosaic.
I passed the many empty classrooms. By the time
the sun had set, students would have absorbed
24,000 hours of knowledge in those rooms.
1 walked to the Main Libe lawn and eased myself
down on the grass. Possibly this was the best van
tage point to see the early morning Stanford. Rising
above the massive oak tree was Hoover Tower, a
poem of symmetry and strength in its early morning
brilliance. Only the incessant chattel' of the birds as
they flitted to and from their nests under the Cub
berley roof disturbed the As I sat there
watching the sun climb higher, everything smelled
fresh and clean and good.
It was getting late now. The 10-minutes-to-8 bell
sounded. In the distance I heard the whistle of a
commuter train. Any minute now, a swarm of stu
dentts would come down from the Row—girls in
crisp cotton dresses, boys in blue denims and Ha
waiian shirts. And for a moment, a fleeting moment,
I wished that I was a great poet or artist so that I
could capture the whole picture in immortal rhyme
or a never-to-he-forgotten painting.
Soon the sleeping giant would be a vibrant, pul
sating Stanford, and the tranquility would be lost.
I looked once more at the peaceful picture, then
turned, and slowly walked to class.

A Bull K" iont-r likes to get a new slant, a new
angle from which to write about Stanford. That's why
I gut up at the crack of dawn yesterday. 1 wanted to

see what kind of a story the early
mornin Stanford could tell the
Stanford that was just beginning
to throw off it;; bed covers.
First, I drove out to the foot
ball stadium and climbed to the
top bench. The flaming ball of
sun was just beginning to peek
through the opening in the south
east tnd. 1 remember times when
S'U.OOO posteriors had edged into
the IK!..";00 seats, when the bellows

i.tii , avcua, witru mc ucuuwa
of the hawkers could be heard above the din of the
crowd, and when the whole crowd had risen as one
person to watch a spectacular play. But now the
ghostly stadium was dead silent, and only little drop
lets of dew covered the benches.
SI the Stadium could break the great muteness,
what a story il could tell! It could boast about the
great footballers who had dug their cleats into its
so t, clean turf — the Nevers, the Ciraysons, the
Standlecs, the Alberts, the McColls.
Next, I went to Lake Lag. This was an entirely
different lake than the afternoon Lake Lag. This
wasn t the caricature ol a lake that everyone kidded
about the lake of choppy waves, murky waters,
and many insects.
No, this was a lake of majestic beauty. The gentle,
vivid green loothills in • the background and the
bushy trees tljat lined the shore were mirrored ex
quisitely in its motionless waters. Two ducks cast
their reflection in the giant looking glass as they
w< pt over the water and then out of sight.
I lelt Lake Lag and walked up and down the

Row. It was the same How you see at any other
time of the day—only without tl\e volleyball frames,
the front-lawn games of catch, the kids exchanging
"hello's" as they pass friends on the sidewalk, and
the rattletraps puttering down the street.
Five or six robins, all in good voice, were sitting
