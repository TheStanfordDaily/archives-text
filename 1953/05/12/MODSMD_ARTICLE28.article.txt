# CAMPUS OPINION
## 'Form Without Substance' 
### 
To the Editor:
! .t: t Wednesday I attended one of the great old
Stanford traditions the Con Home Barbecue—de
pite the prote> ts of friends, less loyal to Stanford
and more ravenous than I, to retire to one of the
peninsula's better known wining and dining spots.
1 was rewarded by a traffic jam approximating the
one that annually follows the Rose Bowl, a stroll
down :i country lane occasionally livened by Stan
lord roughs in speeding cars who seemed intent on
driving the pedestrians up onto the barbed-wire
!< rices, and finally the barbecue itself.
This great treat consisted of two dry hamburger
buns ("Sorry, we've been out of meat for a long
tmi(V said the sweet serving girl), a spot of green
salad, some cold beans, and some cold water in which
a lemon had once been placed. We later discovered
that while we had been told that the ice cream had
lo.iK since been gone, a serving line other than that
which we had passed through still was passing out
ice cream. Our unsuccessful attempts to obtain some
ice exam from this line enlivened wh;it was other
wise ,i very dull evening. On my way out the thoughts
occurred to me:
Has all this done any good for the children in the
home?
Is Sam Mar Donald realty happier now?
Is <1 is what Mrs. Stanford would have wanted?
Or, are the restaurant owners on El Camino
Ore real winners? ,
As we wandered buck down the country lane,
tired but unhappy, I wondered what a picture this
would make to the casual observei from outside Stan
ford. I pictured Dr. Sterling perched on top of a
barbed-wire fence, where the gentle breezes reminded
one of the proximity of the'breeding farm, with a dis
tinguished visitor from Harvard, Oxford, or perhaps .
the Free University of Berlin.
I appreciated Dr. Sterling's dilemma in trying to
explain to the visitor what this procession of students
on foot and ip overheated cars into the woods two or
more mi Vs from their residences in order to consume
a meal of cold beans and dry buns had to do with
thi objectives of a great university, the interests of
charity, or the purposes of the Stanford trust.
We have jus,t elected a group of enthusiastic (in
thoii campaigning anyway) new student body of-
Ic< i and I hope they may give some thought to
this affair.
Pcrhap the barbecue could be limited to those
who actually do work, and a real feast provided (i.e.,
unlimited meat), while the dining halls remain open
and -crve some sort of "cconomy" meal in the in
terests of charity.
Thai the students should do their part in contrib-

uting to the Con Home work is unquestionable, tint
for the great majority "of Stanford students Con
Home Day has become mere form without sub
stance.
I hope a way can be found to use the energy (and
gasoline!) expended in the trek to the barbecue for
a useful purpose.

To the Editor:
The rides situation between campus and Village
is getting steadily worse. Often, especially in the
later evening, one has to wait up to fifteen minutes I
for a lift.
We know drivers late for class are in a hurry; but
it only takes a few seconds to extend common cour
tesy to your neighbor. If you as a driver were
seeking a ride to campus, just how would you feel
it you saw strings of cars passing you by, all of them
obviously going to campus?
But those with cars are not all at fault. Drivers
complain of passengers who slam doors unneces
sarily hard, throw cigarette butts on the floor, and
then get out without a word of thanks.
The onlv way to solve this rides problem is with
co-operation between drivers and hitch - hikers.
Let's have more courtesy from everyone concerned.
Drivers take those few seconds and give a lift I
Hitch-hikers show your appreciation.

To the Editor:
The Senior Class Excom*would like to offer apolo
yirs and explanations to those students who ventured
to Lake Lag Sunday and failed to find the jazz band,
quartets, etc. that had been planned as a part of a
Senior-sponsored day of entertainment.
Our jazz band which was to supply the majority of
the show came tip with a sick leader at the last mo
ment. The time element was such that we were un
able to substitute another band so we had to cancel -
the festivities.
Last quarter when we sponsored the opening of
Lake Lag we had the entertainment but not the j
weather. This quarter we failed again with a re
verse situation.

The Senior Class Excom*would like to offer apolo
yirs and explanations to those students who ventured
to Lake Lag Sunday and failed to find the jazz band,
quartets, etc. that had been planned as a part of a
Senior-sponsored day of entertainment.
Our jazz band which was to supply the majority of
the show came tip with a sick leader at the last mo
ment. The time element was such that we were un
able to substitute another band so we had to cancel -
the festivities.
Last quarter when we sponsored the opening of
Lake Lag we had the entertainment but not the j
weather. This quarter we failed again with a re
verse situation.

! .t: t Wednesday I attended one of the great old
Stanford traditions the Con Home Barbecue—de
pite the prote> ts of friends, less loyal to Stanford
and more ravenous than I, to retire to one of the
peninsula's better known wining and dining spots.
1 was rewarded by a traffic jam approximating the
one that annually follows the Rose Bowl, a stroll
down :i country lane occasionally livened by Stan
lord roughs in speeding cars who seemed intent on
driving the pedestrians up onto the barbed-wire
!< rices, and finally the barbecue itself.
This great treat consisted of two dry hamburger
buns ("Sorry, we've been out of meat for a long
tmi(V said the sweet serving girl), a spot of green
salad, some cold beans, and some cold water in which
a lemon had once been placed. We later discovered
that while we had been told that the ice cream had
lo.iK since been gone, a serving line other than that
which we had passed through still was passing out
ice cream. Our unsuccessful attempts to obtain some
ice exam from this line enlivened wh;it was other
wise ,i very dull evening. On my way out the thoughts
occurred to me:
Has all this done any good for the children in the
home?
Is Sam Mar Donald realty happier now?
Is <1 is what Mrs. Stanford would have wanted?
Or, are the restaurant owners on El Camino
Ore real winners? ,
As we wandered buck down the country lane,
tired but unhappy, I wondered what a picture this
would make to the casual observei from outside Stan
ford. I pictured Dr. Sterling perched on top of a
barbed-wire fence, where the gentle breezes reminded
one of the proximity of the'breeding farm, with a dis
tinguished visitor from Harvard, Oxford, or perhaps .
the Free University of Berlin.
I appreciated Dr. Sterling's dilemma in trying to
explain to the visitor what this procession of students
on foot and ip overheated cars into the woods two or
more mi Vs from their residences in order to consume
a meal of cold beans and dry buns had to do with
thi objectives of a great university, the interests of
charity, or the purposes of the Stanford trust.
We have jus,t elected a group of enthusiastic (in
thoii campaigning anyway) new student body of-
Ic< i and I hope they may give some thought to
this affair.
Pcrhap the barbecue could be limited to those
who actually do work, and a real feast provided (i.e.,
unlimited meat), while the dining halls remain open
and -crve some sort of "cconomy" meal in the in
terests of charity.
Thai the students should do their part in contrib-

uting to the Con Home work is unquestionable, tint
for the great majority "of Stanford students Con
Home Day has become mere form without sub
stance.
I hope a way can be found to use the energy (and
gasoline!) expended in the trek to the barbecue for
a useful purpose.

To the Editor:
The rides situation between campus and Village
is getting steadily worse. Often, especially in the
later evening, one has to wait up to fifteen minutes I
for a lift.
We know drivers late for class are in a hurry; but
it only takes a few seconds to extend common cour
tesy to your neighbor. If you as a driver were
seeking a ride to campus, just how would you feel
it you saw strings of cars passing you by, all of them
obviously going to campus?
But those with cars are not all at fault. Drivers
complain of passengers who slam doors unneces
sarily hard, throw cigarette butts on the floor, and
then get out without a word of thanks.
The onlv way to solve this rides problem is with
co-operation between drivers and hitch - hikers.
Let's have more courtesy from everyone concerned.
Drivers take those few seconds and give a lift I
Hitch-hikers show your appreciation.

To the Editor:
The Senior Class Excom*would like to offer apolo
yirs and explanations to those students who ventured
to Lake Lag Sunday and failed to find the jazz band,
quartets, etc. that had been planned as a part of a
Senior-sponsored day of entertainment.
Our jazz band which was to supply the majority of
the show came tip with a sick leader at the last mo
ment. The time element was such that we were un
able to substitute another band so we had to cancel -
the festivities.
Last quarter when we sponsored the opening of
Lake Lag we had the entertainment but not the j
weather. This quarter we failed again with a re
verse situation.

! .t: t Wednesday I attended one of the great old
Stanford traditions the Con Home Barbecue—de
pite the prote> ts of friends, less loyal to Stanford
and more ravenous than I, to retire to one of the
peninsula's better known wining and dining spots.
1 was rewarded by a traffic jam approximating the
one that annually follows the Rose Bowl, a stroll
down :i country lane occasionally livened by Stan
lord roughs in speeding cars who seemed intent on
driving the pedestrians up onto the barbed-wire
!< rices, and finally the barbecue itself.
This great treat consisted of two dry hamburger
buns ("Sorry, we've been out of meat for a long
tmi(V said the sweet serving girl), a spot of green
salad, some cold beans, and some cold water in which
a lemon had once been placed. We later discovered
that while we had been told that the ice cream had
lo.iK since been gone, a serving line other than that
which we had passed through still was passing out
ice cream. Our unsuccessful attempts to obtain some
ice exam from this line enlivened wh;it was other
wise ,i very dull evening. On my way out the thoughts
occurred to me:
Has all this done any good for the children in the
home?
Is Sam Mar Donald realty happier now?
Is <1 is what Mrs. Stanford would have wanted?
Or, are the restaurant owners on El Camino
Ore real winners? ,
As we wandered buck down the country lane,
tired but unhappy, I wondered what a picture this
would make to the casual observei from outside Stan
ford. I pictured Dr. Sterling perched on top of a
barbed-wire fence, where the gentle breezes reminded
one of the proximity of the'breeding farm, with a dis
tinguished visitor from Harvard, Oxford, or perhaps .
the Free University of Berlin.
I appreciated Dr. Sterling's dilemma in trying to
explain to the visitor what this procession of students
on foot and ip overheated cars into the woods two or
more mi Vs from their residences in order to consume
a meal of cold beans and dry buns had to do with
thi objectives of a great university, the interests of
charity, or the purposes of the Stanford trust.
We have jus,t elected a group of enthusiastic (in
thoii campaigning anyway) new student body of-
Ic< i and I hope they may give some thought to
this affair.
Pcrhap the barbecue could be limited to those
who actually do work, and a real feast provided (i.e.,
unlimited meat), while the dining halls remain open
and -crve some sort of "cconomy" meal in the in
terests of charity.
Thai the students should do their part in contrib-

uting to the Con Home work is unquestionable, tint
for the great majority "of Stanford students Con
Home Day has become mere form without sub
stance.
I hope a way can be found to use the energy (and
gasoline!) expended in the trek to the barbecue for
a useful purpose.

To the Editor:
The rides situation between campus and Village
is getting steadily worse. Often, especially in the
later evening, one has to wait up to fifteen minutes I
for a lift.
We know drivers late for class are in a hurry; but
it only takes a few seconds to extend common cour
tesy to your neighbor. If you as a driver were
seeking a ride to campus, just how would you feel
it you saw strings of cars passing you by, all of them
obviously going to campus?
But those with cars are not all at fault. Drivers
complain of passengers who slam doors unneces
sarily hard, throw cigarette butts on the floor, and
then get out without a word of thanks.
