## 
### PAT KING

and provide a means of expression for local young Democrats."
Education is the primary purpose of the- new organization.

of gagging Republican or independ
ent students with reams of pro-
Democratic propaganda.

controversial issues such as the
McCurran Act, FEPC, tidelands
oil, and Communist investigations
will be conducted in small ■study
groups.
Large meetings featuring promi
nent guest speakers will be held at

are welcome at any of the meetings
and are invited to participate in dis
cussions, regardless of party affili
ation.
