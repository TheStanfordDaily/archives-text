"Why are so many world's records broken at the Fresno Relays?"
This was the question we asked track coach Jack Weiershouser yesterday,
and we received some very interesting answers:
1. The track — kept in excellent condition; worth a tenth of a second,
in the 100 alone.
2. The high calibre of competition, plus the fact the meet occurs at the
right time of year. The athletes are in their best shape.-
3. The fact that $55 gold watches are given as prizes; this has a great
psychological effect on the track men.
4. The fact that certain events, such as the 880 relay, are performed so
seldom in the United States.
5. The pressure exerted on the officials. Propaganda before the relays
advertises that such-and-such a person may break =» record. The sub
conscious thought to the timers is, "I'm not going to have Patton's time at
it.s while everybody else has 5.4."
(i. The troubles the starters have. Attempting to watch nine men in a
.single race is impossible. For instance, Weiershauser says Jack Davis
of (JSC had a two-yard jump on everybody else in his heat of the hurdles.
N<» official can watch such a large number of men for jump starts.

Yesterday a fight took place between Boston Red Sox pitcher Maury
McDeiinott and a Boston spoils writer. It seems that the writer, printing
an account of a game in which McDermott started and was knocked out
of the box in the first frame, twisted his account to imply that the left
hander should be pitching for the Louisville farm team instead of the
Bosox.
This is just one of a series of incidents that seem to indicate that Boston
sports writers are the world's worst.
The flight occurred in the Boston dresing room where only last week
sportswliters were allowed for the first time. For several years before
this Boston was known as the only city that barred writers from quizzing
ball players alter the games. Apparently the fatigued athletes were so
pestered before this that they voted not to allow the writers in the dressing
room. Now it looks as if the old rule will soon be reinstated.
About a month ago after the Tommy Collins fight Boston papers so
criticized Collins that his manager stater that "Collins will never fight
in Boston again." This will probably hold true, even though Collins himself
resides in New England. The papers criticized Collins for not giving up
when he was brutally beaten, rather than criticize the lax Massachusetts
rules that allowed him to continue in the first place.
When Lou Perini left Boston and took his Braves to Milwaukee, he said
that the reason that he was changing cities was not because he was losing
money. Perini enterprises are worth over $100 million, so losing a few
hundred thousand dollars meant nothing. Instead, the reason he left was
the failure of Boston to support the team. "I just hated to see the team
play before an empty house," he declared.
It was later acknowledged that the reason the fans were absent was
the fact that the papers refused to give any decent publicity to the second
division Braves. Then, when the change was announced, loud cries of
"crook" were made by those same newspapers.
Only a few years before, George Preston Marshall was driven from
Boston to Washington with his professional football team. Again, a lack of
publicity was blamed.
When Boston U. was severely trounced in a football game by Maryland
last season, sportswriters pinned the entire blame for the loss on one
player, quarterback liarry Agganis when a leaky line was actually at
fault.
Besides these examples, two successful Boston teams, the basketball
Celtics and the ice hockey Bruins, suffer from lack of journalistic support
after losing a few close games. Those teams are not doing too well
financially either.
When the Braves were leaving Boston, someone remarked, "Boston is
not a two-team town." If the sports writers there don't watch out, Boston
may end being a no-team town in every major sport.
