# Braves Dump Bears in Finale
## 
### RUSS WILKS 
Things weren't at all sweet for the Cal Cinnamon Bears Sat
urday morning as the Braves walloped four pitchers for 10 runs
and 16 hits in their most impressive victory of the year, a 10-1
eight-inning beauty, at Edwards Field.
It was the final game of the season for the Braves, who gained

revenge over the Bears for an ear
lier 6-3 loss and enabled the JV's
to compile an impressive 10 and 3
record.
(iil Duncan, who went the dis
tance, had plenty of hatting sup
port from the likes of Terry
Evans, Leu Swart/, Hog Irvine,
and Sid Hall. Evans was the big
gun of the day as he pounded out
a three-run homer in the sixth
and a two-run circuit swat in the
seventh to personally account fin
live runs. In addition to the old
stogie blasts, Evans collected a
single and two walks for a per
fect day at the dish.
Len Swartz also found the home
run range as he followed Evans'
blast in the seventh with, a shot over
the left fielder's head.
Hall collected three singles and
stole two bases, while Irvine, Ralph
Cassady, Duncan, and Clarke Nel
son all picked up two hits. Nelson
â– was involved in the oddest play of
the day. He broke his bat swinging
at a pitch and grounded the ball
toward short. The top end of the
bat sailed toward the shortstop and
beat the ball. The ball hit the bat

and deflected away. Nelson went
safe and was credited with a single.
Duncan had the Rears well
tamed throughout the contest as
he allowed only four hits, strik
ing out five, walking two. and hit
ting one batter. Cal got its run in
the seventh when Arthur singled
and moved to second on a wild
pitch, lie scored when Dandu
rand fell attempting to (ield Per
ry's lly ball which went for* a
double.
The Braves broke the scoring ice
in the second. Nelson rifled a double
to lelt and stayed put as Cassady
walked. Then after fouling a pitch
off the 3GO-l'oot fence in right field
Duncan singled to load the bases.
Sid Hall singled to score one and
Oleg Suzdaleff sent Cassady home
with a fly ball to center. Irvine de
livered a single, but Duncan was
thrown out at the plate. Evans
drew a walk loading the bases again
and Hall tallied when Dandurand
walked. The rally ended at three
runs as Swartz grounded out.
In the sixth the Braves collected a
quick trio on a walk to Irvine, a

fielder's choice in which both Ir
vine and Dandurand went safe, and
Evans' titanic four-master to left.
Four runs were manufactured
in the seventh when llall singled

and after Su/dalefT popped out
went to second on a wild pitch
and scored on Irvine's hingle.
Then with two out Evans homered
and Swart/, hit for another.
