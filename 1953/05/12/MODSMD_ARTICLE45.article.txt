# FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD DEFINED
## Individual Responsibility Stressed 
### BARBARA TUERK 
Sure, Stanford students know
that the University has a "Fun
damental Standard."
Their sponsors explain it to
them when they first get here.
They promise to follow it when
they fill out their reg books ev
ery quarter.
They brag about it to friends
from schools with complicated
"rulcbooks" when they go home on
vacation.
It's so much p. part of their lives
that they keep forgetting exactly
what it's all about.
That's why Excom has a special
"Fundamental Standard Committee"
to make certain that:
1. New students learn right
away what the Standard really
means.
2. Old students don't forget the
many ways in which it applies to
their conduct.
Tryouts will begin today for five
new members for this committee.
The committee's members like to
quote David Starr Jordan when
they arc explaining what the Stand
ard means. He said:
"Students are expected to show
hoth within and without the Uni
versity such respect for order,
morality, personal honor, and the
rights of others as is demanded (if
good citizens; failure to do this
will he sutTicicnt cause for remov

al from the University."
At Stanford there are no other
rules of conduct, because actually
no others are needed.
Because for a long time students
thought the Fundamental Standard
should be made more specific, the !
committee defined special areas in
which it applies.
They came up with six:
1. Academic work.
The Honor Code is the applica
tion of the Fundamental Standard
to academic work. This year the

Honor Code Committee was merged
with the Fundamental Standard
Committee. *
The joint committee has formu
lated a new Honor Code statement
for next year's Reg Book. Begin
ning next fall students will pledge
to report possible violations of oth
ers to Men's or Women's Council or
to the professor in the course.
• The new pledge will enforce the
"third-person responsibility clause"
which has always been an important
part of the Fundamental Standard
and the Honor Code.
2. Women in men's residences.
Women are voting in house meet
ings next week on a new statement
of conduct to replace the "lone
woman rule." The new statement
relics completely on the Fundamen
tal Standard to judge a woman's ac
tions.
Liquor.
The committee says that "liquor is
a personal problem," but that drink
ing on campus or objectionable be
havior resulting from intoxication
is in violation of the Standard.
I. Student productions.
5. Student publications.
(». Student alTairs and dances.
In all three of these areas the
committee suggests discretion and
common sense as the best criteria
for judging whether or not the
Standard is being broken.
This spring, after over a year of
work, the committee is publishing a
booklet which explains the Stand
ard—its history, its meaning, and

its application. Tlic booklet will lie
mailed to new students and fresh
men this summer, and given to all
students next fall.
Next year's committee will be
particularly busy with a big fall
the new and more specific- formu
oricntation program. explaining
lations of the Standard to the stu
dent ln>dy.
For, as their booklet concludes,
"The Fundamental Standard de
pends upon us, individually and
collectively, for its strength; and it
will function only with the deep un
derstanding, whole - hearted inter
est, and active participation of us
all."
