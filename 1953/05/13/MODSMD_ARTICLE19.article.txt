# Colorful Sets Capture Spirit of '49ers

### JERRY SIMPSON 
A riot of color combinations
coupled with a touch of wick
edness and roughness marks
the efforts of the costume and
set desigrrers of Ram's Head's
Spring Show, "Frisco '49,"
which will be produced on
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday
at 8:15 in Memorial Auditorium.
According to Judith Neilson, cos
tume designer for the production,
an attempt has been made to catch
the spirit of the days of '49 in the
costumes by using brilliant, and
solid colors to signify the boldness
and staunch character of the era.
The miners, who appear in sev
oral scenes, have costumes made
with a touch of roughness and
patches. Heavy beards and clipped
moustaches along with the striped
vest and checked trousers are com
bined to portray the dapper youtv;
men of the town.
In the one scene of the entire pro
duction where the miners dress in
their Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes,
the costumes which Miss NciLson
has created are especially colorful
and outstanding.
I'ndoubtedly. the fandango girls
presented Che biggest problem in
• lie designing and making of the
costumes. The girls bad to appear
slightly wicked and yet maintain
a certain air of respectability. OIT-
I he-shoulder blouses, slim bug
ging skirts, and dark hose with
flashy garters create the proper
note.
High kicking is the cause of many
last-minute alterations. It seems the
fandango girls tend to lose pounds
at their regular rehearsals, and
consequently skirts have to be taken

in every few days.
Perhaps the most outstanding cos
tumes of the entire show arc those
made for Flora Malonc (Edi*'n
Strickland), who is the feminine
lead in the production. In a scene
where Flora is hoping anxiously
that her would - he true love is
aboard a ship that has just entered
the bay, she appears in a brilliant
yellow ofT-thc-shoulder qown.
The dark hair of the actress
and the yellow gown combine to
give an illusion of brightness and
gaiety. As one observer poetically
vemnrked, "like a sunflower in a
bright sea of green." Several
costume changes have been made
for the feminine lead and each
one is designed to make her the
center of attraction.
A careful and wary cheek of pe
riodicals of the period is the basis
of ideas for the scenery. Scenery
designer is Roger Morris.
I.ike the costumes, the scenery is
marked by a skillful combination ol
brilliant and pleasing colors. The
show calls for many special effects
in the painting and for many
changes of scenery. Everything from
trre:. on a hill to the doors on the
town saloon is marked by eye
catching combinations of co!oi.
The buildings of the town and
other wooden structures which
arc seen on stage have been me
ticulously constructed. They are
complete lo the last split hoard
and bent nail in a hastily con
structed community.
Dance director Joan Hunt has
done an outstanding job in re-cre
ating the rip-roaring air of 100 years
ago. The fandango girls have been
carefully schooled in the ways the
show must go and turn in a spright
ly, syncopated rhythm. Miss Hunt
herself turns in a pleasing perlorm-

I ance as one of the fandango girls. A
I combination of harem and back
| room styles gives just the right bit
: of naughtiness that the show de
j mands. Comedy is provided in

j dance steps in the person of the sa
! loon owner (Ron Finebcrg), who
I does a witty song and dance num-
I bcr.
Tickets for the production are

| $1.20, 5)0 cents, and HO cents, and
may be purchased at the special
booth at Engineering corner, the
Peninsula Box Oce, Stanford Play
j ers' box office, or Rain's Head office.
