## 
### 
TOKYO, Wednesday, May 13
(UP) —A United Nations package
plan to break the' Korean truca
deadlock and wind up the war in
short order was ready for presen
tation to the Communists today.
Gen. Mark W. Clark personally
carried the Washington - approved
armistice proposal from Tokyo to
Korea. The Supremo Commander
said at Seoul he believed it might
finally bring peace after 22 months
of truce talk.s.
Allied negotiators were cxpected
to hand the counter-proposal across
the green baize conference table at
Panmunjom when today's meeting
opens at 11 a.m. (7 p.m. Tuesday
PDT), or possibly tomorrow.
Clark said the plan preserved the
principle of voluntary repatriation
of war prisoners, for which the Al
lies have fought more than a year.
An eight-point Communist plan
proposed to pass that problem along
to a post-armistice political confer
ence.
It. "gathers up several points,"
Clark said on his six-hour flying
trip to Korea, indicating it was a
package proposal on the pattern of
several the Allies have offered in
the past.
Skimpy clues to the contents of
the plan prompted speculation that
the Allies would accept the Red
scheme for handing on the fate of
unwilling prisoners to a political
conference, but demand a time limit
for the release of the captives.
While in Korea, the Supreme
Commander spent an hour with
President Syngman Rhee to discuss
"certain aspects of the armistice ne
gotiations." Rhee has opposed out
spokenly any settlement leaving
Korea divided, and has threatened
to ignore an armistice.
