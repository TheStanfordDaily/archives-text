### 
WASHINGTON, May 12 (UP)—President Eisenhower named
Adm. Arthur W. Radford new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff today in a shakeup of the nation's top military command.
Radford, currently commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet and
a World War II aircraft carrier commander, will succeed General

►of the Army Omar N. Bradley. H<:
I will become the first Navy man to
head the Joint Chiefs.
Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway, com
mander of the North Atlantic Treaty
forces, was named to succeed Gen.
J. Lawton Collins as Army Chief <,i
Staff. Gen. Alfred M. Gruenther,
now Ridgway's deputy, will succeed
him as Supreme Allied Commander
in Europe.
The President also announced
that Adm. Robert B. Carney, com
mander-in-chief of NATO forces in
Southern Europe, will replace Adm.
William M. Fechteler as Chief of
Naval Operations at an undesignat
ed future date.
The nomination of Gen. Nathan
Twining as Air Force Chief of Si -iff
last week, followed by today's <ir>-
nouncement, mans a complete
change of the uniformed heads of
the defense establishment.
(Government spokesmen indie I-•
ed that all new appointees would
have actually assumed their posts
by the end of the summer.)
The shakeup answered demand:,
by Senate Republican Leader Rob
ert A. Taft and other GOP Con
gressmen for a complete new slate
of military chiefs who could tnke
a "new look" at. overall military
strategy and spending plans.
Taft, who called the new appoinl
ments "excellent," has contended
the present chiefs were too close to
the former Democratic administra
tion to put into effect plans the Re
publicans feel are necessary to bal
ance the budget and cut taxes.
