# Spring Nonsense
## 
### 
Here we go again! Or do we?
Last spring a wave of "panty raids" rolled
across the country, not a little encouraged by
gleeful press association copy.
Nationally the reaction v/as a flow of critical
thought, guestioning the basis on which silly,
immature boys were deferred from the draft
for college, study, only to spend their time
in vandalistic endeavors.
Locally the result was an abortive raid on
Roble which slipped in just at the end of the
spree.
At that time there was a certain amount of
criiicism leveled at the administration, the
ASSU, and the Daily for ignoring the raids
until they spread to the local campus.

These units received criticism for going on
the obviously unsound assumption that Stan
ford ,s<udents knew how to have fun without
causing harm; that Stanford students made a
habit of conducting themselves in a manner
just a cut above the senseless.
The rash of spring raids or riots or what
have you seems to be breaking out once more
on the nation's college campi. USC blackened
its name in Los Angeles. Yale, Michigan State,
and Ohio State students have also contributed
to the nonsense.
This time let no one say we didn't advise
against such antics.
We don't mean to preach. It's simply that
there are other more important, more sensible,
and more entertaining things to do.
