### DICK MALTZMAN 
SIIRDLUMANSIIIP
Regardless of what anyone says, Etaoin Shrdlu is
Stanford's most famous non-graduate. Here is a per
son who's name has appeared in more papers than
any man living, including Herbert Hoover. Here is
a person whose exploits as founder of the C.S.F.M.-
T.M 0.0.L.W.A.T. (The Caliiorna Soc'Ptv For Mpkiny

The Most Out Of Life Without
Actually Trying) have gone down
in the records as among the most
notable lifemanship ploys and
gambits ever perpetrated against
society.
For it is this same Etaoin Shrdlu
who drove a brand new Cadillac
convertible around the state with
the gold plate on the door that said
simply, "TO E.S. FROM YOUR
OLD PAL, EARL WARREN,

GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA." He is the same
Etaoin Shrdlu who, after being clocked at 93 going
through Morgan Hill, slowed to 55, flagged the inevi
table cop to come alongside of him. and said simply,
"Don't ask any questions, just follow me!" And pro
ceeded on at 93.
The policeman pulled in front of him and gave him
full siren until Shrdlu reached the first service sta
tion. At this point he slammed on his brakes, pulled
up with a screech of burned rubber next to the Men's
Room, and disappeared into the head. When he ie
turned a half hour later the oop was gone.
Ah, but his exploits don't end here. While at Stan
ford he wowed the females with his many exploits.
When delivering a girl to her respective Row House,
he would pull out a ring with approximately 20 keys
on it, thumb through them, and state simply "I know
I have the key to your house here someplace."
He was finally forced to leave school when a ploy
actually backfired on him. When he asked a girl he
had been pinned to for a-week and a half for his pin
back (this, by the way. was one of the four pins he
had in circulation at all times), she ran upstairs,
brought down a gross of assorted pins, and asked him
to pick out his own—"She wasn't sure which one it
was!!!"
The shocjt was too much for him.

Ah, but his greatest ploy came when but a fresh
man in college. His father, a miserly ojcl man who
lived a simple life in their thirty room cottage on the
Sunset Strip, gave his son a scarce thousand a quar
ter for spending money. After furnishing his room
comfortably (for pictures of the furnishings see
House and Garden, Nov. 1938; pp.l2-276), refitting his
car to clock 185 (then considered fast), and living
lustily for almost a quarter, the incomparable Etaoin
found that he had spent almost three thousand, his
entire year's allowance. »
It began to look like a long, dry winter.
But never at a loss for ideas, he came up with the
perfect out—his father's dog. Oh, how his father
loved that dog. He would lie at the old patriarch's
feet at night, before the fire. He was the perfect com
panion. In truth, there was some question about
who he loved more, Caesar»(the dog) or Mrs. Shrdlu.
And then Etaoin hit upon it he wrote and told
his father about the great Viennese professor at Stan
ford who could make a dog talk for only $1,000.
"Think of it, Dad—you'll be able to talk about poli
tics, world affairs, even the market with him.
And so it came to pass that Etaoin lived well for
a quarter. *
But. you know how money goes at college. His
thousand didn't last long, and soon it became neces
sary to find more money.
"Dad," wrote Etaoin, "he talks fine now, but all he
knows is the latest female dogs in the neighborhood
and his dog food—he's an utter bore. But we have a
new professor who claims he can teach a dog to
read. For only another thousand ..."
And so it went until summer vacation. Father
Shrdlu was getting rather impatient for the return of
his son and the dog whose value had jumped $2,000.
And then young E.S. returned home without the dog.
' Dad," he said, "brace yourself for a shock. Caesar
(the dog) and I were riding home on the train to
gether and Caes (he preferred us to call him that) put
down the paper he was reading, took off his glasses
and said, 'Do you think dad's still having that affair
with the maid?' Well, no dog is going to talk about
my father like that—l pulled out my gun and shot
him!"
But pappa** Shrdlu one-upped him in the end—
"Are you sure he's dead?" said he.

It began to look like a long, dry winter.
But never at a loss for ideas, he came up with the
perfect out—his father's dog. Oh, how his father
loved that dog. He would lie at the old patriarch's
feet at night, before the fire. He was the perfect com
panion. In truth, there was some question about
who he loved more, Caesar»(the dog) or Mrs. Shrdlu.
And then Etaoin hit upon it he wrote and told
his father about the great Viennese professor at Stan
ford who could make a dog talk for only $1,000.
"Think of it, Dad—you'll be able to talk about poli
tics, world affairs, even the market with him.
And so it came to pass that Etaoin lived well for
a quarter. *
But. you know how money goes at college. His
thousand didn't last long, and soon it became neces
sary to find more money.
"Dad," wrote Etaoin, "he talks fine now, but all he
knows is the latest female dogs in the neighborhood
and his dog food—he's an utter bore. But we have a
new professor who claims he can teach a dog to
read. For only another thousand ..."
And so it went until summer vacation. Father
Shrdlu was getting rather impatient for the return of
his son and the dog whose value had jumped $2,000.
And then young E.S. returned home without the dog.
' Dad," he said, "brace yourself for a shock. Caesar
(the dog) and I were riding home on the train to
gether and Caes (he preferred us to call him that) put
down the paper he was reading, took off his glasses
and said, 'Do you think dad's still having that affair
with the maid?' Well, no dog is going to talk about
my father like that—l pulled out my gun and shot
him!"
But pappa** Shrdlu one-upped him in the end—
"Are you sure he's dead?" said he.

SIIRDLUMANSIIIP
Regardless of what anyone says, Etaoin Shrdlu is
Stanford's most famous non-graduate. Here is a per
son who's name has appeared in more papers than
any man living, including Herbert Hoover. Here is
a person whose exploits as founder of the C.S.F.M.-
T.M 0.0.L.W.A.T. (The Caliiorna Soc'Ptv For Mpkiny

The Most Out Of Life Without
Actually Trying) have gone down
in the records as among the most
notable lifemanship ploys and
gambits ever perpetrated against
society.
For it is this same Etaoin Shrdlu
who drove a brand new Cadillac
convertible around the state with
the gold plate on the door that said
simply, "TO E.S. FROM YOUR
OLD PAL, EARL WARREN,

GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA." He is the same
Etaoin Shrdlu who, after being clocked at 93 going
through Morgan Hill, slowed to 55, flagged the inevi
table cop to come alongside of him. and said simply,
"Don't ask any questions, just follow me!" And pro
ceeded on at 93.
The policeman pulled in front of him and gave him
full siren until Shrdlu reached the first service sta
tion. At this point he slammed on his brakes, pulled
up with a screech of burned rubber next to the Men's
Room, and disappeared into the head. When he ie
turned a half hour later the oop was gone.
Ah, but his exploits don't end here. While at Stan
ford he wowed the females with his many exploits.
When delivering a girl to her respective Row House,
he would pull out a ring with approximately 20 keys
on it, thumb through them, and state simply "I know
I have the key to your house here someplace."
He was finally forced to leave school when a ploy
actually backfired on him. When he asked a girl he
had been pinned to for a-week and a half for his pin
back (this, by the way. was one of the four pins he
had in circulation at all times), she ran upstairs,
brought down a gross of assorted pins, and asked him
to pick out his own—"She wasn't sure which one it
was!!!"
The shocjt was too much for him.

Ah, but his greatest ploy came when but a fresh
man in college. His father, a miserly ojcl man who
lived a simple life in their thirty room cottage on the
Sunset Strip, gave his son a scarce thousand a quar
ter for spending money. After furnishing his room
comfortably (for pictures of the furnishings see
House and Garden, Nov. 1938; pp.l2-276), refitting his
car to clock 185 (then considered fast), and living
lustily for almost a quarter, the incomparable Etaoin

Etaoin Shrdlu who, after being clocked at 93 going
through Morgan Hill, slowed to 55, flagged the inevi
table cop to come alongside of him. and said simply,
"Don't ask any questions, just follow me!" And pro
ceeded on at 93.
The policeman pulled in front of him and gave him
full siren until Shrdlu reached the first service sta
tion. At this point he slammed on his brakes, pulled
up with a screech of burned rubber next to the Men's
Room, and disappeared into the head. When he ie
turned a half hour later the oop was gone.
Ah, but his exploits don't end here. While at Stan
ford he wowed the females with his many exploits.
When delivering a girl to her respective Row House,
he would pull out a ring with approximately 20 keys
on it, thumb through them, and state simply "I know
I have the key to your house here someplace."
He was finally forced to leave school when a ploy
actually backfired on him. When he asked a girl he
had been pinned to for a-week and a half for his pin
back (this, by the way. was one of the four pins he
had in circulation at all times), she ran upstairs,
brought down a gross of assorted pins, and asked him
to pick out his own—"She wasn't sure which one it
was!!!"
The shocjt was too much for him.

Ah, but his greatest ploy came when but a fresh
man in college. His father, a miserly ojcl man who
lived a simple life in their thirty room cottage on the
Sunset Strip, gave his son a scarce thousand a quar
ter for spending money. After furnishing his room
comfortably (for pictures of the furnishings see
House and Garden, Nov. 1938; pp.l2-276), refitting his
car to clock 185 (then considered fast), and living
lustily for almost a quarter, the incomparable Etaoin
found that he had spent almost three thousand, his
entire year's allowance. »
It began to look like a long, dry winter.
But never at a loss for ideas, he came up with the
perfect out—his father's dog. Oh, how his father
loved that dog. He would lie at the old patriarch's
feet at night, before the fire. He was the perfect com
panion. In truth, there was some question about
who he loved more, Caesar»(the dog) or Mrs. Shrdlu.
And then Etaoin hit upon it he wrote and told
his father about the great Viennese professor at Stan
ford who could make a dog talk for only $1,000.
"Think of it, Dad—you'll be able to talk about poli
tics, world affairs, even the market with him.
And so it came to pass that Etaoin lived well for
a quarter. *
But. you know how money goes at college. His
thousand didn't last long, and soon it became neces
sary to find more money.
"Dad," wrote Etaoin, "he talks fine now, but all he
knows is the latest female dogs in the neighborhood
and his dog food—he's an utter bore. But we have a
new professor who claims he can teach a dog to
read. For only another thousand ..."
And so it went until summer vacation. Father
Shrdlu was getting rather impatient for the return of
his son and the dog whose value had jumped $2,000.
And then young E.S. returned home without the dog.
' Dad," he said, "brace yourself for a shock. Caesar
(the dog) and I were riding home on the train to
gether and Caes (he preferred us to call him that) put
down the paper he was reading, took off his glasses
and said, 'Do you think dad's still having that affair
with the maid?' Well, no dog is going to talk about
my father like that—l pulled out my gun and shot
him!"
But pappa** Shrdlu one-upped him in the end—
"Are you sure he's dead?" said he.

SIIRDLUMANSIIIP
Regardless of what anyone says, Etaoin Shrdlu is
Stanford's most famous non-graduate. Here is a per
son who's name has appeared in more papers than
any man living, including Herbert Hoover. Here is
a person whose exploits as founder of the C.S.F.M.-
T.M 0.0.L.W.A.T. (The Caliiorna Soc'Ptv For Mpkiny

The Most Out Of Life Without
Actually Trying) have gone down
in the records as among the most
notable lifemanship ploys and
gambits ever perpetrated against
society.
For it is this same Etaoin Shrdlu
who drove a brand new Cadillac
convertible around the state with
the gold plate on the door that said
simply, "TO E.S. FROM YOUR
OLD PAL, EARL WARREN,

GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA." He is the same
Etaoin Shrdlu who, after being clocked at 93 going
through Morgan Hill, slowed to 55, flagged the inevi
table cop to come alongside of him. and said simply,
