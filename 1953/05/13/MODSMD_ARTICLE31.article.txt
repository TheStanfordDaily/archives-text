To the Editor:
Getting the Con Home cleaned up last Wednesday
was a most gratifying task. It is only fitting and ap
propriate that the persons who so thoughtfully lent
their services should be thanked by the entire student
body.
Three trucks were loaned to vis by:
1. Perry Feed Company
2. Peninsula Feed and Fuel Conipan.v
H. The Stanford AROTC Unit (Driven by Sgt.
Schweitzer).
Fifty gallons of gasoline were donated by Mr.
Walt Heinecke, proprietor of Heinecke's Shell Ser
vice on campus.
All of the paint was donated through the Corp Yard
Paint Shop.
For those who haven't noticed, the winged lions
on each side of the El Camino entrance to the Con
Home are now a brilliant bronze. This was accomp
lished through Mr. Blacker, superintendent of
grounds, by Mr. Webb of the Paint Shop.

To the Editor:
As an art student I agree with Sue Wheat about
the gilt department taking over the Bookstore!
However, one can still find the books if one looks

hard The art students are not that fortunate! The
Bookstore is continuously out of basic art materials
because of a lack of storage space (they have just
run out of the regular water-color paper thereby
stranding thirty students in the middle of the quar
ter).
No art materials are carried except those pre
scribed for classes. Why not stock and dispay some
of the fine art materials that students would like to
purchase and use irrespective of their class require
ments instead of covering the counters and tables
with department store quality gift items! Isn't the
Sookstoro an adjunct of an educational institution?

To the Editor:
We of Phi Kiippa Sigma wish to thank you for the
great service you have rendered us. We were faced
with the almost insurmountable task of disposing of
our gallant and beloved white elephant after her
untimely end on Sunday.
Our only regret is that the "Big Mo," after being
referred to in the past in the Daily as a battleship,
a privateer, and a viking ship, closed its career under
the inglorious title of "barge," In closing, we would
like to bequeath the charred remains of this battle
scarred veteran to the Class of '57's bonfire.
Until next year's Water Carnival, we remain,

To the Editor:
As an art student I agree with Sue Wheat about
the gilt department taking over the Bookstore!
However, one can still find the books if one looks

hard The art students are not that fortunate! The
Bookstore is continuously out of basic art materials
because of a lack of storage space (they have just
run out of the regular water-color paper thereby
stranding thirty students in the middle of the quar
ter).
No art materials are carried except those pre
scribed for classes. Why not stock and dispay some
of the fine art materials that students would like to
purchase and use irrespective of their class require
ments instead of covering the counters and tables
with department store quality gift items! Isn't the
Sookstoro an adjunct of an educational institution?

To the Editor:
We of Phi Kiippa Sigma wish to thank you for the
great service you have rendered us. We were faced
with the almost insurmountable task of disposing of
our gallant and beloved white elephant after her
untimely end on Sunday.
Our only regret is that the "Big Mo," after being
referred to in the past in the Daily as a battleship,
a privateer, and a viking ship, closed its career under
the inglorious title of "barge," In closing, we would
like to bequeath the charred remains of this battle
scarred veteran to the Class of '57's bonfire.
Until next year's Water Carnival, we remain,

Thanks
To the Editor:
Getting the Con Home cleaned up last Wednesday
was a most gratifying task. It is only fitting and ap
propriate that the persons who so thoughtfully lent
their services should be thanked by the entire student
body.
Three trucks were loaned to vis by:
1. Perry Feed Company
2. Peninsula Feed and Fuel Conipan.v
H. The Stanford AROTC Unit (Driven by Sgt.
Schweitzer).
Fifty gallons of gasoline were donated by Mr.
Walt Heinecke, proprietor of Heinecke's Shell Ser
vice on campus.
All of the paint was donated through the Corp Yard
Paint Shop.
For those who haven't noticed, the winged lions
on each side of the El Camino entrance to the Con
Home are now a brilliant bronze. This was accomp
lished through Mr. Blacker, superintendent of
grounds, by Mr. Webb of the Paint Shop.
