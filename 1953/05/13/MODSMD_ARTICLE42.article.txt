Why doesn't Stanford support crew?
Why don't we build a new field house?
Why doesn't Stanford lower its entrance requirements for good athletes
so that we can have superior athletic teams?
Who determines athletic policy?
What is our athletic budget?
These and other vital questions will be answered by members of the
Stanlord Athletic Board at 7:30 tonight at a symposium in Cubberley

Auditorium This is the time for stu
dents to air their gripes and ask I
questions about aspects oi the ath- !
letic situation.

What with the haseballers eye
ing the championship .the track
men going wild, and the swimmers
and golfers winning PCC titles for
themselves, some Stanford women
stars have been shoved out of the
headlines they deserve.
The first is Mickey Wright, chris- •
tened Mary Katerine Wright. Mick
ey, a freshman inmate at Branner,- j
is the National Junior Golf Cham
pion. having won that title at„Peb
ble Beach last year. She meddled
7G at that match. She also won in .
the Thunderbird Invitational at
Palm Springs and the Indio Invita- j
tional, also at Palm Springs. Three \
weeks ago, she copped the amateur j
crown at the San Diego Open. I
Mickey, a blond psych major, plans
to enter the pro ranks upon her
graduation.

Sally Phillips, a soph from Piedmont, recently garnered gobs of honors
at the National Indoor Synchronized Swimming meet at Des Moines.
Sully (with three other girls) placed first in the quartet ballet swimming,
third in the duet, and fourth in the solo.
Sharon Geary, another lemme splasher just cracked the world's record
for the 75 yard free style last Saturday. She recently came close to a
record while taking second in the AAU 100 free style. The girl who won
broke the record.
The fourth woman star of note is Brynhild Grasmoen, the streamlined
master of the skis from Merced. The girl with the Scandinavian monicker
placed first among American skiers in the '48 Olympics. Then she was in
active for a while because of a bangecl-up knee. returned to
the wars of the waxed boards again this last winter while working 'at
Sun Valley, and distinguished herself.
She won the highly-coveted Alta Cup while breezing home first in
the Giant Slalom at Alta, Utah. Then Brynhild tied for second in the
slalom at the Sun Valley championships, competing against the best in
the business. The senior philosophy major then traveled to Vermont to
compete, and while traversing an icy slope, managed to break her ankle.
That finished her competition for the year.

One of the items that will come up for discussion at the PCC presidents
conference this spring will be the abolishing of freshman sports. This step,
which would be a radical change, is being seriously considered. It would
be an unexcusable mistake, in our opinion, to ban frosh competition.

Bob Mathias will not ummpete for Stanford in the Nationals. Why? He's
getting married about that time.

Stanford has already landed several top high school basketball pros
pects for next year, among them Bill Bond, an AII-CIF sharpshooter.
There's a 50-50 chance that Jim KauiVman will come to Stanford. Kauf
man, six-foot four and All-City in Los Angeles, is rated one of the finest
basketball prospects in many years.

The Stanford sports fans will have a field day on the weekend of May
30th. That is the weekend of the baseball play-off between the northern and
southern division winners of the PCC. It will be held at Stanford, if
Stanford wins the southern division which it is highly likely to do. Also
slated for the same weekend is the PCC track finals, to be held in the
Stadium.
