# Varsity's Booming Bats Conquer Hornets 13 to 4
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
Relaxing from league play, Stanford's baseballers eased to a
13-4 victory over the Sacramento State Hornets yesterday on the
Sunken Diamond.
Three Indian hurlers, Mike Acker, Don DeLong, and Ken
Brown, held the visitors to four hits. Coach Everett Dean used 16

players in the contest.
The Card batters rattled the
fences all day. The big blow of
the game was Tom Dandurand's
second homer of the year over the
left field wall. Dandurand has been
on the bench most of the season
being substituted late in the game
when the score became one-sided.
The big inning for the Stanford
batters was the third, when they
scored eight runs on seven hits and
two walks. First sacker Hal Hen
nacy and Acker both collected a
pair of hits in the frame, Hennacy
scoring two runs.
Another big hit was a towering
triple over the center fielder's head
by Chuck Essegian. The drive,
which traveled 480 feet in the air,
was one of three blows for the left
fielder. Second sacker Rich Scra
niaglia also collected a trio of base
knocks before he left the game.
The best news of the day for
the Card nine was not the vic
tory, however. The doctor's ex
amination of Bob Murphy's in
jured back revealed him to be re
covering from a mild case of pleur
esy. He is almost fully recovered
now and should be in good enough
condition to hurl this weekend.
If Murphy, who suffered his only
league defeat of the year Saturday
when he went one frame, is com
pletely recovered by Friday, Dean
will undoubtedly have him pitch
then, in order to have him ready for
Tuesday's game against Santa Clara.
This weekend the Indians play a
pair of tilts against Cal, followed by
the last regularly scheduled game
with the Broncos. Stanford needs
to split with Cal for the Southern
Division crown, and take two out
of three to tie for CIBA champion
ship.
Thus, a double victory this week
end would give the Cards a PCC win
and a CIBA tie, which should be

good enough to gain an NCAA in
vitation for Stanford.
