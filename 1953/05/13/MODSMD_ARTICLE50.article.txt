# Bronco Nine Routs Frosh
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman baseballers
fell apart in the sixth inning yes
terday and their 12-game winning
streak fell with them. Santa Clfira's
Broncos were the villains, exploding
for an 11-4 victory.
Today the frosh host Modesto High
on the freshman diamond with Ray
Young on the mound.
The winners shattered a 2-2 tie
with a six-run sixth and a three
run seventh as the Papoose pitchers
and infielders had control and field
ing troubles.
Starter Jack Heffelfinger was re
moved in favor of A 1 Dunn with the
bases loaded, one out, and no runs
scored in the sixth. But the next
four men reached bases via three
walks and an error, and Santa Clara
was long gone.
Ron Wagner started a futile
comeback, providing the lone Stan
ford bright spot with a line-drive
home run over the left field fence
in the bottom of the sixth. Neil Pa
piano, who had singled, trotted
home on Wagner's blast.
Bronco hurler Joe Wedow kept
Stanford's six hits well scattered,
but nevertheless was in a tight
pitchers' battle until the sixth.—
