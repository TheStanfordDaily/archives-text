# ATHLETIC SYMPOSIUM
## Crew Asks for Support‘Stanford Can't Afford It’ 
### MIKE HUDSON Daily Sports Editor 
Tho ciew risked for more money last night, and was again told
that there was nothing to spare.
Crew members made up a good part of the audience of a
hundred who fired questions at six men representing various
phases of Stanford athletics last night in Cubberley Auditorium.

As Athletic Director Al Masters <
reeled off the tremendous costs of j
keeping up the Stanford athletic !
plant, it became apparent that un- \
dor the present tct-up there is not ,
the slightest hope for any financing i
the crew. However, it was sug
gested that perhaps by charging ad- !
mission to students at contests with
UCLA-or by selling athletic student
body cards, the students might pay j
the way for th<y crew and the other j
minor sports which are now sup- |
porting themselves.
Student crew coach Jim Fifer,
speaking from (lie floor, said that
the crcw could get by on $17,250
a year. Masters and Richard
Balch. representing the Stanford
Athletic Board, doubted that they
could <;ct by that cheaply, but in
sistcd that, regardless, there was
no money for them.
Pete Grothe, speaking for the stu
dents, suggested that perhaps the '
crew could lie given a token allot- j
inent so that the crew men could j
be given blocks, but Masters and I
Balch made it clear that any support
would be on an all or nothing basis.
The panel made it clear that the
only way that sports such as wres
tling, crcw, polo, and gymnastics
could be supported would be to turn
football, which carries practically
the entire financial load for athlet
ics, into big business.
Coach Chuck Taylor, Skip Crist,
who spoke for Stanford athletes,
and Director of Admissions Rix
ford Snyder made it clear that
this was out of the question. At
Stanford, it is a ease of students
competing hi sports, not athletes J
going to classes.
Crist recalled how Taylor had
briefed him his first day out for
football on the overall part the game
plays in the Stanford scene. "Foot
hall must be, and is, part of the
student s overall education. When
it becomes more than that, it has
no place at Stanford." Balch pointed
out that the percentage of the foot
ball team which is minus scholasti
eally is less than the over-all men's
average.
Other questions found supporters
of wrestling and gymnastics asking
for better coaching, better begin
ning classes, and better safety facil
ities.
Masters pointed out that there
was a full-time gymnastics coach
and that wrestling had been
coached voluntarily by Chuck
Taylor when he was frosh foot
hall coach and was now stagger
ing along without a regular coach.
Masters revealed that the athletic
department had originally estimated
a $515,000 income and ,$561,000 ex
penditures this year, but managed
to show a profit for the year. How
ever, he explained that this profit
could not be given to minor sports.
The swimming pool bleachers have
been condemned and the Stadium
seats soon will be, and a reserve
fund has become a necessity.
