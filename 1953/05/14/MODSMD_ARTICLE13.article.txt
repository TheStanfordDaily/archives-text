# Complete Text Of Academic Freedom Note

### 
The academic freedom statement
being circulated at Stanford reads
as follows:
"We believe that the primary pur
pose of a university is the educa
tion of its students. We do not mean
education in the one religious, politi
cal or moral view most favored by
our society, but the explanation, dis
cussion. and criticism of all views,
the decision resting finally with the
individual student.
"We object to any action by the
national or state governments which
will limit academic freedom and im
poverish our education. Although
we do not challenge the legal right
of congress to investigate in the uni
versities, we protest the current in
vestigations because they can result
only in harm to our educational
system.
"The investigators may expose a
few individual communists, it is true,
but the Federal Bureau of Investiga
tion can find subversives with less
harm to innocent individuals and to
the nation
"The investigations are dangerous
because:
"a) Teachers are condemned for
their political beliefs, whereas they
should he judged on their teaching
ability. This can he done best by
their colleagues.
"b) The committee investigations
defame individuals, greatly dam
aging the reputation and earning
power of those named who are
innocent, and acting as a deterrent
to those who would otherwise
enter education.
"c) The questioning of teachers
by a government agency, and the
disqualification of a few whose po
litical views are considered dan
gerous does much more than re
move the particular views from
the university. When a few "dan
gerous" voices are removed, many
more critical thinkers are afraid
to speak, and the university ceases
to generate the questioning atti
tude which is essential to democ
racy.
"Destruction of the freedom of
the university is a threat to the
democracy we wish to preserve,
while the open expression of all
views by university teachers is es
sential to its preservation."
