## Statement Writers Voted Special Committee Posts 
### HADLEY ROFF ssociate Editor, The Daily 
Excom last night moved to evtend the membership of its special
committee on academic freedom to include members of the stu
dent group circulating a statement condemning current Con
gressional investigations into supposed subversion in colleges.
Chairman of the Excom committee, Charlotte Trego, indicated

the group will work closely with
President Sterling and other Uni
versity administrators in framing a
statement concerning academic free
dom.
Miss Trego read a letter from Dr.
Sterling to Student Body President
Dick Weismann offering his help.
Membership of the committee wa ,
left open to any students interested
in the subject.
Appointed to the committee were
Barbara Tuerk. Sid Field, and Donna
Gould, all 'representing the group
currently circulating a petition r.u
academic freedom and congres
sional investigations.
Several Excom members, partial •
larly Miss Trego and Student Man
ager Steve Horn, voiced fear that

the statement currently being cir
culated might be twisted by the
press and made to seem pro-Corn •
munist.
Miss Tuerk answered that such
fear shouldn't militate stu •
dent action.
"We can't always be afraid to
speak on such controversial mat -
ters, because in whatever we say
we stand the chance of misinterpre
tation," she said.
She and Field strongly indicated
their group will not withdraw i* .
statement from circulation or with
hold sending it to Dr. Sterling.
They agreed, however, that fur -
ther study of the issue would he
valuable and that any statement
reflecting the official attitude of
the student body would be mere
forceful than their document
They pledged they would ro-op
crate wholeheartedly with the cf
forts of the newly formed Excom
committee.
The special committee was formed
four days ago.
It. includes Weismann, Student,
Body Vice-President Ellin Myci,
Vice-President-elect Jeannie Bobi' ,
and Student Body President-elect
Don Lozabnick.
