# Investigations vs. Academic Freedom
## 
### 
The recent McCarthy and Velde investiga
tions have aroused a large part of the academic
world to the need for redefining the concept:
academic heedom and responsibility.
Since the Wisconsin senator has declared
that those who oppose his investigations are
Communists, people like the group of Stanford
.students who have simply drawn up a state
ment and passed it around for signatures are
painted in a dim light.
Kxcorn and the Administration have dis
cussed means of discouraging this statement.
Considering the case on a theoretical plane
we frankly cannot see how or why Excom or
the Administration should be opposed to d
statement explaining the Stanford students'
thought on the subject of academic freedom
and its relation to the congressional investi
gations.
Other segments of the academic world —the
American Association of University Professors,
the American Association of Universities, even
the Stanford University faculty have or will
expioss their definition.
President Sterling was a member of the AAU
committee which drafted that group's state
ment, and he appointed the faculty committee
which is preparing Stanford's policy to present
to the entire faculty for its consideration.
Jf academic freedom and responsibility
could be conceived as a partisan issue, then
Stanford's name is already well attached to it.
Other student groups have also expressed
themselves.
We believe this issuance of thought on aca
demic freedom is both healthy and vital.
However, to be mote pragmatic, it is hard
to conceive how the many Stanford students
who have signed the statement opposing the

congressional investigations know as much
about the nature of academic freedom as
their signatures indicate.
We commend to these students' reading the
AAU pamphlet on academic freedom and re
sponsibihty.
To present a few of our own thoughts-
Academic freedom implies an environment
in which conscientious and unfettered scholar
ship may be carried on. It further implies an
environment wherein ideas of all kinds may
clash fieely with an end toward finding those
most worthwhile and nearest the truth, if there
be a universal truth.
Since virtually all thought will have <a bias
of one sort or another, there is a responsibility
to present that bias honestly so as to prevent
academic freedom from destroying itself.
Professors and students are not entities
above and apart from the law. They are citizens
in their community like anyone else. Accord
ingly, they are bound to co-operate with the
legitimate functioning of their government.
Accordingly also they are bound to help
determine the legitimate functioning of their
government, by study and by thought.
We believe that the mass of students should
take the time to think through the nature of aca
demic freedom and responsibility and of the
investigations as the Stanford faculty is doing.
We believe they will then be able to offer
members of the academic profession con
structive assistance in selling the concept of
academic freedom arid responsibility to the
nation.
We hope they will then derive methods more
effective than a mass of signatures affixed to a
flat statement which will convince the nation
that McCarthy's and Velde's investigations are
doing little good and possibly great harm.

take the time to think through the nature of aca
demic freedom and responsibility and of the
investigations as the Stanford faculty is doing.
We believe they will then be able to offer
members of the academic profession con
structive assistance in selling the concept of
academic freedom arid responsibility to the
nation.
We hope they will then derive methods more
effective than a mass of signatures affixed to a
flat statement which will convince the nation
that McCarthy's and Velde's investigations are
doing little good and possibly great harm.
The recent McCarthy and Velde investiga
tions have aroused a large part of the academic
world to the need for redefining the concept:
academic heedom and responsibility.
Since the Wisconsin senator has declared
that those who oppose his investigations are
Communists, people like the group of Stanford
.students who have simply drawn up a state
ment and passed it around for signatures are
painted in a dim light.
Kxcorn and the Administration have dis
cussed means of discouraging this statement.
Considering the case on a theoretical plane
we frankly cannot see how or why Excom or
the Administration should be opposed to d
statement explaining the Stanford students'
thought on the subject of academic freedom
and its relation to the congressional investi
gations.
Other segments of the academic world —the
American Association of University Professors,
the American Association of Universities, even
the Stanford University faculty have or will
expioss their definition.
President Sterling was a member of the AAU
committee which drafted that group's state
ment, and he appointed the faculty committee
which is preparing Stanford's policy to present
to the entire faculty for its consideration.
Jf academic freedom and responsibility
could be conceived as a partisan issue, then
Stanford's name is already well attached to it.
Other student groups have also expressed
themselves.
We believe this issuance of thought on aca
demic freedom is both healthy and vital.
However, to be mote pragmatic, it is hard
to conceive how the many Stanford students
who have signed the statement opposing the

congressional investigations know as much
about the nature of academic freedom as
their signatures indicate.
We commend to these students' reading the
AAU pamphlet on academic freedom and re
sponsibihty.
To present a few of our own thoughts-
Academic freedom implies an environment
in which conscientious and unfettered scholar
ship may be carried on. It further implies an
environment wherein ideas of all kinds may
clash fieely with an end toward finding those
most worthwhile and nearest the truth, if there
be a universal truth.
Since virtually all thought will have <a bias
of one sort or another, there is a responsibility
to present that bias honestly so as to prevent
academic freedom from destroying itself.
Professors and students are not entities
above and apart from the law. They are citizens
in their community like anyone else. Accord
ingly, they are bound to co-operate with the
legitimate functioning of their government.
Accordingly also they are bound to help
determine the legitimate functioning of their
government, by study and by thought.
We believe that the mass of students should
take the time to think through the nature of aca
demic freedom and responsibility and of the
investigations as the Stanford faculty is doing.

structive assistance in selling the concept of
