# CAMPUS OPINION
## Constructive Ideas 
### 
To the Editor; -
Messrs. Galal and Ali having chosen a rather un
constructive approach to the Palestine refugee prob
lem, we would like to try and suggest a few hope
fully constructive ideas.
As pointed out before, no settlement of the Israel-
Arab situation could be affected before a solution
has been worked out for the refugees' plight. In
recognition of this situation, Israel has, to date, under
taken the lollowing steps: It has admitted into Israel
members of Arab families who were separated by the
war -part of the family having remained in what
later came to be Israel.
It has given complete religious and political free
dom (o its Arab citi/ens, as is set forth in the Israeli
Constitution; and it has indicated to the I'.N. that
it is willing (o release to their Arab owners in the
refugee camps in Jordan, etc., bank balances in Is
raeli banks which they had to their credit in 1048.
Israel has kept careful track of property left be
hind by the refugees, and the government, through a
special department the Custodian of Abandoned
Property—has administered these assets to date.
Israel has not, nor does it intend to disregard the
property lights of the Arab owners of these assets.
Concerning the future, we have stated again and
again thai we are willing to help substantially and
materially in the resettlement of the Arab refugees.
Ibis means that we will help build new homes for
these refugees and might possibly permit some of
them to return to the territory of Israel, the safety of
the state permitting.
So much for Israel. What have the Arab states done
in this direction to date? Precious little the refu
gees are used a.s a lever in political maneuvering and
as ammunition for so-called "harangues." The Arab
governments themselves are putting obstacles in
the way of the restitution of bank balances to their
refugee owners. This restitution would obviously put
the Israelis in a light in which these governments
would not wish to have them seen by the refugees.
It must also be noted that there are in Israel 250,-
000 Jewish refugees from Arab persecution in Arab
countries. They have been successfully resettled
there. However, the Arab countries are quite deaf
when it comes to settling their property claims.
It must be emphasized to the Arabs again and again,
that it is impossible to eat one's cake and have it
too It can l>e easily verified through newspaper files

that the Arab refugees left their homes before the
war huil actually started, and no number of denials
could change this fact.
It is further surprising that none of the so vol
uble Aral) spokesmen cared to mention the fact
that five months later, the whole Arab population of
Western Galilee—l2o.oo(l people—elected to stay put
and accept Israeli citizenship when this section
came under Israeli rule. Could it he these Arabs
had heaid the "good word" on the warm reception
their brethren had in the neighboring lands of ref
uge; or was it that they accidentally found out that
the Israelis did not eat Arabs for breakfast! Be that
as it may, they now have their representatives
(elected by (hem!) in the Israeli parliament, and
some of them are in New York right now on Israeli
government scholarships.
We are only too human too, and therefore cannot
resist the temptation to say a few things about that
great article, "Why the Fuss."
As far a.s we are concerned, there is no monetary
valuation on Israel for us- our homeland is not
something we leave, to visit our neighbors, when
bullets fly through the air. We, therefore, don't
have to toil in the counting house to assign dollars
and cents values to the labor and sacrifices of drain
ing marshes and building roads and power stations;
and, incidentally, neither do the Arabs of Western
Galilee feel that need.
What is much more serious is your sabre rattling.
How do you expect us to take eVen a suggestion
such as Mr. Nashashihi's seriously if you inform
us smugly (hat, regardless of rehabilitation, you
wish to engage in further battles in the near or
far future.
Gentlemen, war is one hell of a mess, and just as
this latest one of your own doing shows, doesn't solve
a thing! However, we wish also happily to inform you
that we feel quite secure in ourselves- thank you!—
even though you've had your second speaker on
campus in two quarters
This exchange of information by letter could go
on indefinitely. We would be happy to meet the Arab
students in a personal discussion of ffee issues in
order to exchange constructive ideas.

It has given complete religious and political free
dom (o its Arab citi/ens, as is set forth in the Israeli
Constitution; and it has indicated to the I'.N. that
it is willing (o release to their Arab owners in the
refugee camps in Jordan, etc., bank balances in Is
raeli banks which they had to their credit in 1048.
Israel has kept careful track of property left be
hind by the refugees, and the government, through a
special department the Custodian of Abandoned
Property—has administered these assets to date.
Israel has not, nor does it intend to disregard the
property lights of the Arab owners of these assets.
Concerning the future, we have stated again and
again thai we are willing to help substantially and
materially in the resettlement of the Arab refugees.
Ibis means that we will help build new homes for
these refugees and might possibly permit some of
them to return to the territory of Israel, the safety of
the state permitting.
So much for Israel. What have the Arab states done
in this direction to date? Precious little the refu
gees are used a.s a lever in political maneuvering and
as ammunition for so-called "harangues." The Arab
governments themselves are putting obstacles in
the way of the restitution of bank balances to their
refugee owners. This restitution would obviously put
the Israelis in a light in which these governments
would not wish to have them seen by the refugees.
It must also be noted that there are in Israel 250,-
000 Jewish refugees from Arab persecution in Arab
countries. They have been successfully resettled
there. However, the Arab countries are quite deaf
when it comes to settling their property claims.
It must be emphasized to the Arabs again and again,
that it is impossible to eat one's cake and have it
too It can l>e easily verified through newspaper files

that the Arab refugees left their homes before the
war huil actually started, and no number of denials
could change this fact.
It is further surprising that none of the so vol
uble Aral) spokesmen cared to mention the fact
that five months later, the whole Arab population of
Western Galilee—l2o.oo(l people—elected to stay put
and accept Israeli citizenship when this section
came under Israeli rule. Could it he these Arabs
had heaid the "good word" on the warm reception
their brethren had in the neighboring lands of ref
uge; or was it that they accidentally found out that
the Israelis did not eat Arabs for breakfast! Be that
as it may, they now have their representatives
(elected by (hem!) in the Israeli parliament, and
some of them are in New York right now on Israeli
government scholarships.
We are only too human too, and therefore cannot
resist the temptation to say a few things about that
great article, "Why the Fuss."
As far a.s we are concerned, there is no monetary
valuation on Israel for us- our homeland is not
something we leave, to visit our neighbors, when
bullets fly through the air. We, therefore, don't
have to toil in the counting house to assign dollars
and cents values to the labor and sacrifices of drain
ing marshes and building roads and power stations;
and, incidentally, neither do the Arabs of Western
Galilee feel that need.
What is much more serious is your sabre rattling.
How do you expect us to take eVen a suggestion

Messrs. Galal and Ali having chosen a rather un

fully constructive ideas.
As pointed out before, no settlement of the Israel-
Arab situation could be affected before a solution
has been worked out for the refugees' plight. In
recognition of this situation, Israel has, to date, under
taken the lollowing steps: It has admitted into Israel
members of Arab families who were separated by the
war -part of the family having remained in what
later came to be Israel.
It has given complete religious and political free
