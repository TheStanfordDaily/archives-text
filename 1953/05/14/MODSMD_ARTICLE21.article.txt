I too have stood upon the shores of Lugunita,
The lolling waves catching the fire of the flaming sun.
My heart wafc touched with joy I must repeata,
To see the ducks drift past me one bv one
0
The liltim* heauty of a duck in motion
Brings to my memory those sweet days of yore,
When gallant men in helmets pledged devotion
By sweating dew from every faithful pore.
Yea, many a battle fought upon the oval,
Where good, clean, sweet, green grass was wont to sprout,
As on the How, where feathered friends' bethrothal
Proclaimed through delicate pipes Ti ue Love ring out!
Sound bells! Of that tall towc-ring tuwei <>1 heauty,
Majeslic as the scene it bioods upon;
Fair couples, young in heart and hope and duty,
tJo hand in hand across the emerald lawn.
Oil lithe and graceful evei -moving motion.
My heart pulsates in tune with friend Grothe's.
The earth is covered with three-fourths of ocean,
And one Bull Session brimming with cliches.
