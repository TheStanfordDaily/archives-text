## POT SHOTS 
### 
i Want a good preview of next year's football team? Next Saturday at 2
(lie gridders will hold a scrimmage. Although the team is no longer
allowed to scrimmage under full game conditions, the Block Sand Buck
id the Month Club will lie there, and Chuck Taylor will undoubtedly put
on a good show for the men who line up much of Stanford's gridiron
| talent.

Coach Everett Dean, when asked to compare the 1950 CIBA champions
with this year's crew stated, "I believe the 1053 team is as good or perhaps
better. I have confidence that this team; under the fine leadership of co
captains Shepard and Essegiun, will duplicate the performance of the
15)50 team. This team has made all of its breaks this year, and is due i'or
some good breaks in the immediate future."
It's interesting to note that in 1950, Stanford won the CIBA, but USC
win the PCC which means the CIBA minus Santa Clara. USC happily sur
prised the Cards by stepping aside, and letting the Cards go t<» the NCAA.
Since then a rule was passed lorbidding the FCC winner from stepping
aside. This is lucky for Stanford for they may lie or even lose the CIBA
to the Trojans, but are almost certain to win the PCC and hence the
NCAA bid.

Stanford's golf team mopped up the rest of the league in winning the
PCCs but their score of (>l2 wasn't too sharp. They will have to shoot
: under 590 to place one-two-three in the nationals. However, according
to coach Bud Finger, last weekend's (il2 was worth a 590. "With the lees
back where they were, a wind so high that it knocked two planes out of
the sky. and the rough up to five feet high, that course played tougher
than any other in California including Pebble Beach!

Boxing coach Ray Lunny, who a couple months ago perfectly predicted
j the Gavillan-Davey fight for us, looks for Rocky Marciano to have an
easier time with Joe Wolcott than last time when the two men clash to
morrow night> in a nationally televised fight.
In fact, of the current crop of heavyweights, Lunny gives only Ezzard
Charles a small chance oved the hard-punching Marciano. He predicts
that Charles and Roland La Starza will never fight since they are lining
them both up for title shots. "They're getting awfully short of challengers."
Grant Butcher, who is now up for allegedly strong-arming gambler
Walter Burkett under the orders of Paul "Bouquet" Cohn (no relation
to the Bouquet Cahn who was Daily sports editor last semester), looks
for an upset.
Butcher, who fought in these parts foi many years, says, "Wolcott is too
crafty a fighter to be suckered again." Butcher suggests that with the three
knock-down rule in effect, Wolcott might floor Marciano three times in
one round and the referee would have to stop the fight even though the
tough Marciano might be in good shape. The interview was cut short when
I the judge walked in.

What makes -,\ great pitcher? It's becoming obvious that Robin Roberts
of the Phillies is on his way to joining such National League immortals
as Grover Alexander, Christy Matliewson, Kid Nichols, Carl llubbell. and
|)iz/y Dean. He has won 95 games and he is 27 years old. He may become
the seventh modern pitcher to win .'5OO games.
Looking at an average Roberts victory, control and the ability to get
the batters out <|iiickly seem to be his secret. In a recent trouncing ol
the Cubs, Roberts toiled for 48 minutes in winning (! to 1. Me threw 11(»
pitches, 36 of which were halls. Fifty-three were strikes and the other
27 were hit; 211 for outs, one for an error, and six for hits. He struck out
I six, walked two.
In six of his innings, Roberts slid by on nine pitches or less. In other
words, he attempts to get every hatter out as quickly as possible. Only
when men get on base does he start working the corners and going /or
the strikeout. Control and the realization that there are eight good men
behind him seem to be what makes this pitcher great.

I do that, although Ruth had over 700 homers and Cobb over 4,000 hits.

Coach Everett Dean, when asked to compare the 1950 CIBA champions
with this year's crew stated, "I believe the 1053 team is as good or perhaps
better. I have confidence that this team; under the fine leadership of co
captains Shepard and Essegiun, will duplicate the performance of the
15)50 team. This team has made all of its breaks this year, and is due i'or
some good breaks in the immediate future."
It's interesting to note that in 1950, Stanford won the CIBA, but USC
win the PCC which means the CIBA minus Santa Clara. USC happily sur
prised the Cards by stepping aside, and letting the Cards go t<» the NCAA.
Since then a rule was passed lorbidding the FCC winner from stepping
aside. This is lucky for Stanford for they may lie or even lose the CIBA
to the Trojans, but are almost certain to win the PCC and hence the
NCAA bid.

Stanford's golf team mopped up the rest of the league in winning the
PCCs but their score of (>l2 wasn't too sharp. They will have to shoot
: under 590 to place one-two-three in the nationals. However, according
to coach Bud Finger, last weekend's (il2 was worth a 590. "With the lees
back where they were, a wind so high that it knocked two planes out of
the sky. and the rough up to five feet high, that course played tougher
than any other in California including Pebble Beach!

Boxing coach Ray Lunny, who a couple months ago perfectly predicted
j the Gavillan-Davey fight for us, looks for Rocky Marciano to have an
easier time with Joe Wolcott than last time when the two men clash to
morrow night> in a nationally televised fight.
In fact, of the current crop of heavyweights, Lunny gives only Ezzard
Charles a small chance oved the hard-punching Marciano. He predicts
that Charles and Roland La Starza will never fight since they are lining
them both up for title shots. "They're getting awfully short of challengers."
Grant Butcher, who is now up for allegedly strong-arming gambler
Walter Burkett under the orders of Paul "Bouquet" Cohn (no relation
to the Bouquet Cahn who was Daily sports editor last semester), looks
for an upset.
Butcher, who fought in these parts foi many years, says, "Wolcott is too
crafty a fighter to be suckered again." Butcher suggests that with the three
knock-down rule in effect, Wolcott might floor Marciano three times in
one round and the referee would have to stop the fight even though the
tough Marciano might be in good shape. The interview was cut short when
I the judge walked in.

What makes -,\ great pitcher? It's becoming obvious that Robin Roberts
of the Phillies is on his way to joining such National League immortals
as Grover Alexander, Christy Matliewson, Kid Nichols, Carl llubbell. and

the seventh modern pitcher to win .'5OO games.
Looking at an average Roberts victory, control and the ability to get
the batters out <|iiickly seem to be his secret. In a recent trouncing ol
the Cubs, Roberts toiled for 48 minutes in winning (! to 1. Me threw 11(»
pitches, 36 of which were halls. Fifty-three were strikes and the other
27 were hit; 211 for outs, one for an error, and six for hits. He struck out
I six, walked two.
In six of his innings, Roberts slid by on nine pitches or less. In other
words, he attempts to get every hatter out as quickly as possible. Only
when men get on base does he start working the corners and going /or
the strikeout. Control and the realization that there are eight good men
behind him seem to be what makes this pitcher great.
