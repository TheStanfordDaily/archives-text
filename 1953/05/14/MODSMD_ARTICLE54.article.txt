# THE 						DU PONT
## DU PONT SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING GRADUATES MEET THE PUBLIC IN Technical Sales 
### 
Morn and more, industry is on the
lookout for technically trained men
and science majors who have an in
terest in and aptitude for selling. A
number of departments at Du Pont
prefer men with such training for
sales positions. A technical under
standing of the properties of a sub
stance helps a man do a better selling
job—and offers the customer better
service.
Because of thediverse applications
of Du Font's many products, there
is a need for sales representatives
with widely varying technical back
grounds. There are problems involv
ing chemistry and many types of en
gineering in such fields as plastics,
ceramics, textiles and many others.
Technical men may work in direct
sales, sales service, or sales develop
ment groups, depending on depart

mental organization. In some ea.ips
technical men handle all phases v of
selling. In others they deal mainly
with customer problems. Some de
partments also maintain a sales de
velopment section that workspn tech
nical problems connected with the
introduction of a new product or a
new application for an established
one.
Hc*re are examples of the kind of
problems attacked by technical men
in Du Pont sales groups:
1. Find a more economical way to
apply sodium silicate used in making
corrugated paperboard. Du Pont
men, as in many other instances,
were able to make substantial sav
ings for the customer.
2. Introduce fabrics of "Orlon"aeryl
ic fiber for use in dust filtration. This

in volved evaluation and modifica
tion of filter fabrics in cooperation
with makers of dust-control equip
ment, and with plant personnel hav
ing serious dust-recovery problems.
3. Reduce the time needed for proc
essing motion-picture film used by
race tracks. Technical service men
carried the problem to a research
group which developed an emulsion
that could be processed in about one
third the former time.
Technical men interested in sales
work at Du Pont usually acquire
needed background in a laboratory
or manufacturing plant. Depending
on their interest and abilities, they
may then move into technical sales
service, sales development, or direct
sales.
In any of these fields, the man with

prefer men with such training for
sales positions. A technical under
standing of the properties of a sub
stance helps a man do a better selling
job—and offers the customer better
service.
Because of thediverse applications
of Du Font's many products, there
is a need for sales representatives
with widely varying technical back
grounds. There are problems involv
ing chemistry and many types of en
gineering in such fields as plastics,
ceramics, textiles and many others.
Technical men may work in direct
sales, sales service, or sales develop
ment groups, depending on depart

mental organization. In some ea.ips
technical men handle all phases v of
selling. In others they deal mainly
with customer problems. Some de
partments also maintain a sales de
velopment section that workspn tech
nical problems connected with the
introduction of a new product or a
new application for an established
one.
Hc*re are examples of the kind of
problems attacked by technical men
in Du Pont sales groups:
1. Find a more economical way to
apply sodium silicate used in making
corrugated paperboard. Du Pont
men, as in many other instances,
were able to make substantial sav
ings for the customer.
2. Introduce fabrics of "Orlon"aeryl
ic fiber for use in dust filtration. This

with makers of dust-control equip

3. Reduce the time needed for proc
essing motion-picture film used by
race tracks. Technical service men
carried the problem to a research
group which developed an emulsion
that could be processed in about one

Technical men interested in sales
work at Du Pont usually acquire
needed background in a laboratory
or manufacturing plant. Depending
on their interest and abilities, they
may then move into technical sales
service, sales development, or direct
sales.
