### 
Ry JERRY SIMPSON
A quiet hush has fallen over
activities in Mom Aud as the
cast and stage crcw bring to a
halt their preparations
for tonight's presentation of the
annual Spring Show, "Frisco
'49."
Everything is in readiness. From
the moment, the curtain is raised
until 11 io closing scene, the thought
foremost in each person's mind will
he the determination that the clos
ing curtain on Saturday evening will
not mark the end of this story.
Tickets to the production may bo
purchased for $1.20, 90 cents, and
60 cents at the Peninsula Box Office,
Stanford Players' box office, or from
the Ram's Head office. Curtain time
is 8:15.
Will this musical be given the
greatest of honors and find its place
on Broadway? Will the songs catch
on and become national favorites?

till'. ' lory powerful enough and
compelling enough to capture thn
heart of mu::ir.il America? Holly
wood and local backers think per
haps it is.
Ram':; Ih-ad officials revealed
yesterday that Hollywood has eon
j firmed the rumor that, represents -
| f.ives from Columbia, MGM, and
Paramount studios will be in tho
I audience on opening night. Uncon
; firmed rumors have it that several
i well-known Hollywood personalities
j who may be interested in the show
j as a vehicle for their own personal
fame will also be present.
Regardless of the fate of the
show, the audience is promised a
delightful evening of entertain
ment by way of orchestrations,
dance numbers, and many heart
tugffing and gay melodies. David
Hughes, musical composer, has
employed many popular musical
devices in an attempt to capture
the wicked and free-as-the-wind
spirit of the days of '49.

Mi;":- Hannah':; tent show ju the
i up-and-coming little community of
San Franei.ro was a night, i-pot
where a tired miner after a fruitless
j day of .searching for nuggets could
I go for a little wine, cards, and fan
dango. Miss Hannah (Margaret
Christensen) is a local belle who
j has been around for several years
| and in her pokings about the town
I she has learned how to earn a fast,
| buck and to keep out of trouble.
She finally drifts into show busi
ness and nabs Flora Malone (Edith
, Strickland), a sweet, young thing
from the states, to be her star sing
| ing attraction.
Not to be outdone by the scintil
' lating performance of the cast, the
costume and set designers, Judith
Neilson and Roger Morris, have
joined forces to recreate an atmos
phere of 100 years ago. Both the
sets and the costumes arc notable
lor their brilliant color and an au
. thentic representation of the clothes
and hastily constructed buildings in

j a rough and ready mining town
Topping the entire production
and adding sparkle to all its parts
is tho music of the show. Duets
by Flora and Jim (Raymond Ham
med), harmonic choruses from
the miners which are highlighted
by a sparkling tenor solo, and the
final chorus are only samples of
the outstanding numbers of the
show.
The musical drama is being pro
i dueed by a student east headed by
] Edith Strickland as Flora, Raymond
Hammett as Jim Fenway, Margaret,
j Christensen as Hannah, and co-au
thor Ted Marcuse as Sidney.
Other members of the cast include
! Bill Burke as Tom, Jerry Fortis,
I Dick Winter, Mike Wogan, Dick
| Davis, Ron Fineberg, Helen Davies,
Joan Mouritzen, Nancy Simms, Joan
Hunt, Joy Olsen, Buzzy Damrosch,
l Marilyn Early, Susy Marion, Pat
Currier, Bill Zidbeck, Diek Maltz
i man, Jack Fine, Don Riley, and
i Roger Morris.


WILL SHE CATCH HlM?—Flora Malone (Edith Strickland) holds
the hand of her would-be true love Jim Fenway (Raymond Ham
mett) and hopes desperately that she can snare him into matri
mony. Hollywood representatives of MGM, Paramount, and
Columbia studios will be in the audience tonight to see if she
is successful. —Daily photo by Glenn Erickson

A quiet hush has fallen over
activities in Mom Aud as the
cast and stage crcw bring to a
halt their preparations
for tonight's presentation of the
annual Spring Show, "Frisco
'49."
Everything is in readiness. From
the moment, the curtain is raised
until 11 io closing scene, the thought
foremost in each person's mind will
he the determination that the clos
ing curtain on Saturday evening will
not mark the end of this story.
Tickets to the production may bo
purchased for $1.20, 90 cents, and
60 cents at the Peninsula Box Office,
Stanford Players' box office, or from
the Ram's Head office. Curtain time
is 8:15.
Will this musical be given the
greatest of honors and find its place
on Broadway? Will the songs catch
on and become national favorites?

till'. ' lory powerful enough and
compelling enough to capture thn
heart of mu::ir.il America? Holly
wood and local backers think per
haps it is.
Ram':; Ih-ad officials revealed
yesterday that Hollywood has eon
j firmed the rumor that, represents -
| f.ives from Columbia, MGM, and
Paramount studios will be in tho
I audience on opening night. Uncon
; firmed rumors have it that several
i well-known Hollywood personalities
j who may be interested in the show
j as a vehicle for their own personal
fame will also be present.
Regardless of the fate of the
show, the audience is promised a
delightful evening of entertain
ment by way of orchestrations,
dance numbers, and many heart
tugffing and gay melodies. David
Hughes, musical composer, has
employed many popular musical
devices in an attempt to capture
the wicked and free-as-the-wind
spirit of the days of '49.

Mi;":- Hannah':; tent show ju the
i up-and-coming little community of
San Franei.ro was a night, i-pot
where a tired miner after a fruitless
j day of .searching for nuggets could
I go for a little wine, cards, and fan
dango. Miss Hannah (Margaret
Christensen) is a local belle who
j has been around for several years
| and in her pokings about the town
I she has learned how to earn a fast,
| buck and to keep out of trouble.
She finally drifts into show busi
ness and nabs Flora Malone (Edith
, Strickland), a sweet, young thing
from the states, to be her star sing
| ing attraction.
Not to be outdone by the scintil
' lating performance of the cast, the
costume and set designers, Judith
Neilson and Roger Morris, have
joined forces to recreate an atmos
phere of 100 years ago. Both the
sets and the costumes arc notable
lor their brilliant color and an au
. thentic representation of the clothes
and hastily constructed buildings in

j a rough and ready mining town
Topping the entire production
and adding sparkle to all its parts
is tho music of the show. Duets
by Flora and Jim (Raymond Ham
med), harmonic choruses from
the miners which are highlighted
by a sparkling tenor solo, and the
final chorus are only samples of
the outstanding numbers of the
show.
The musical drama is being pro
i dueed by a student east headed by
] Edith Strickland as Flora, Raymond
Hammett as Jim Fenway, Margaret,
j Christensen as Hannah, and co-au
thor Ted Marcuse as Sidney.

WILL SHE CATCH HlM?—Flora Malone (Edith Strickland) holds
the hand of her would-be true love Jim Fenway (Raymond Ham

mony. Hollywood representatives of MGM, Paramount, and
Columbia studios will be in the audience tonight to see if she
is successful. —Daily photo by Glenn Erickson
