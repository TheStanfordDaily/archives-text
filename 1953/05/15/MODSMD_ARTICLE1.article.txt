# 'FRISCO '49'
## Spry Music, Lively Cast Please Opening fighters 
### BOB REZAK 
"Frisco '49," Ram's Head's 1953 Spring Show, opened its three
night world premiere engagement last night' to an enthusiastic
audience in Memorial Auditorium. It was an audience that
laughed, applauded, and went away humming an essentially rich
score of sprightly tunes.
It was a show possessed of a generally talented cast, but an

essentially weak and hackneyed
story. Co-author Ted Marcusc, to
be sure, has come up with a show |
that ranks ;«s a high-caliber college
production.
Whether it can actually make
the Broadway grade as the ad
vance publicity indicated it might
- on the merits of its present story,
which often lags but is saved by the
music, remains to be seen.
A little more originality, a little
re-writing, with a few extra
laughs tossed in for good measure,
might have taken the show out of
the category of a dozen other mu
sical comedies where girl meets
hoy, girl loses boy, and finally girl
gets hoy.
But "Frisco "49" is an ambitious
undertaking for any group profes
sional or otherwise—and the Stan
ford group docs an admirable and
and capable job.
The music and lyrics by David
Hughes arc lively and pleasing to j
hear, particularly the lilting "Bright
New Day"and the bouncy "Friend I
of a Friend."
The show's feminine lead, Edith
Strickland, as the beautiful Flora
Malonc (and she is beautiful),
turns in a high-grade acting per
formance, but unfortunately her
singing voice is not cxccptioilil.
It docs not seem to carry too well
and she seems to strain on the
high notes.
Male lead Ray flammett, who :
plays Jim, has a dear deep voice
that undoubtedly helped set the j
pace for the show in such solo num- j
bers as "Trouble for a Sailor" and
Bright Blue Sky."
However, it was Bill Burke as I
Tom who turned in the evening's
stellar performance. His acting and
his warm tenor voice drew some of
the evening's heaviest applause. His i
"When She Comes to Live with Mc" ;
solo, and "Friend of a Friend," j
which he sings with the male cho
rus, were more than outstanding.
Marcusc himself acted the part
of Sid with professional brilliance.
And Ronald Fein berg as Trigger,
the saloon keeper, brought chuck
les from the audience in his ren
dition of "Show Mc."
Though the script apparently
called for her to be the hard-boiled
manager of a vaudeville show, Buck
ets Christensen as Hannah seemed
to be over-acting and her voice was
too manufactured and at times raspy
and irritating.
Scenery by Roger Morris and
costumes by Judith Nielsen were
cleverly executed and captured
the show's gold rush theme.
In the song "Hard to Please," the
cast of "Frisco '49" claims: "If you
don't like San Francisco, you're just
hard to please."
If tonight's and tomorrow night's
ticket-holders do not find "Frisco
19" an entertaining evening of the
ater, then they're just hard to
please.
