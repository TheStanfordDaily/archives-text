WASHINGTON, May M (UP)
President Eisenhawer said today
that hi:; shakeup of the Joint. Chiefs
of StafT docs not mean a change it)
the nation's basic defense strategy
although there may be occasional
tactical shifts.
The world is round and has no
ends, Mr. Eisenhower told his nnw.s
conference, and there is no merit in
weighing thp strategic importance
of Europe against, that of the Far
East.
Some quarters had interpreted the
stafT changes as foreshadowing a re
orientation of defense planning from
Europe to Asia. Mr. Eisenhower
sairl the strategy remains global
with only a possibility of shifts in
tactics as various situations warrant.
Tactics apply to limited military
deployment while strategy involves
an overall defense concept.
Adm. Pad ford, chief of (lie U.S.
Pacific Fleet, is known to favor
.stronger cfTorts auainst Far Eastern
Comunism.
Sen. Robert A. 'Iaft (R., O.) and
o I h c r Republican Congressional
leaders had urged the stafT switches.
They have said for years that the |
United States has not been paying j
enough attention to the Far East.
