The ASSU yesterday re-empha -
sized its policy regarding the rules
and regulations governing l.hr usn
of Lake Lagunita and specifically
its use by non-Stanford student-,
through H. Donald Winbigler, dean
of students.
Winbigler said that the added
problem of the violation of regul < -
tions by non-Stanford students ha ,
added a heavy burden to the duties
of the life guards.
"The vigilance that is necessary i<i
protect Stanford students alone can .
not be interrupted by the j>oli':r.
function of life guards in keeping
the lake clear of non-Stanford .stu
dents," he added.
"No one except Stanford student
shall be allowed on the boathou.v;
deck or in Lake Lagunita. This i ;
rule number one and it must bo
observed to facilitate the
of the lake," Winbigler asserted.
