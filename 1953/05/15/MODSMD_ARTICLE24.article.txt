# Like Lag Open To Stanfordites Only
## 
### 
The ASSU yesterday re-empha-
sized its policy regarding the rules
and regulations governing the use
of Lake Lagunita and specifically
its use by non-Stanford students,
through H. Donald Winbigler, dean
of students.
Winbigler said that the added
problem of the violation of regula-
tions by non-Stanford students has
added a heavy burden to the duties
of the life guards.
"The vigilance that is necessary to
protect Stanford students alone can-
not be interrupted by the police
function of life guards in keeping
the lake clear of non-Stanford .stu
dents," he added.
"No one except Stanford students
shall be allowed on the boathouse
deck or in Lake Lagunita. This is
rule number one and it must be
observed to facilitate the governing
of the lake," Winbigler asserted.
