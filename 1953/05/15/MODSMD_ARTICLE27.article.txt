# Face the World
## 
### 
Stanford, by slow, almost imperceptible
steps, is climbing from its traditional ivory
tower and is beginning to face the world.
Excom look a significant step in this direction
Wednesday night when it voiced serious de
termination to frame a statement regarding aca
demic freedom.
In our opinion it is high time that Stanford
took action in defense of academic freedom
and against the largely irresponsible and
reckless attacks stemming from some con
gressional committees.
Stanford has so far stood silent as professors
and administrators of other colleges have been
harangued and smeared by congressional com
mittees purportedly checking subversion in
education.
However, the University and its student body
apparently intend to abandon this passive
role.
A faculty committee has been working on
the academic guestion for several months and
is expected to come up soon with a significant
statement.
And Excom, at its last meeting—perhaps
the sharpest and most profitable held this
year - showed willingness to take up the
problem from the student's view.
Excom acted when it became manifest that

many students are deeply concerned with the
problem.
Interest in academic freedom has been point
ed up by a group of students who have drawn
up and circulated a statement on the subject.
By yesterday more than 600 students had
signed the statement.
In Excom's opinion, however, this state
ment does not reflect the general student
opinion in as much as most students are not
prepared to take as negative a stand on the
investigations as proposed by the document.
It is to frame a statement fitting general stu
dent opinion that Excom appointed its special
committee on academic freedom, headed by
Charlotte Trego.
The group, according to Miss Trego, will
work closely with the Administration in draft
ing an appropriate statement. President Ster
ling has promised he will assist the group in
every way possible.
One particularly fine thing about the com
mittee is the attitude of its members. Appar
ently all are interested in framing a sound,
sensible, reflective document.
With such an attitude, the Excom statement
combined with the faculty declaration should,
when published, add new strength in the fight
for academic freedom. —Hadley Roff
