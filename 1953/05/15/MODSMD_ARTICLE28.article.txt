### PETE GROTHE 
FRIDAY MORNING ROUNDUP
I wa:: on my way home from a closing-out bargain
basement sale at the Sigma Nu house recently when
three guys pushed me into the bushes.
"Lissen," they chorused, "we're getting sick of it,
see!"
I stepped aside while they got sick.
"We're getting sick of opening the Daily on a
nice spring morning and seeing yo" v a,mu</

staling up at us. Why couldn't
you b» j a beautiful girl?"
"The name's Grotay," I allowed.
"All right," I shot back, "I'll
pul a picture of a beautiful girl
in next time."
"That's n hot idea," they said
coldly.
And so I hat': why Joyce Eng
blom's picture is in Bull Ses
sion this morning.

SPRING SHOW STUFF. This yea. „ Ul ,,^
"Frisco '49" is guilty of gross misrepresentation of
history. Things were tough for the men during the
gold rush days. What with a stern director of ad
missions and tough entrance requirements and all,
the ratio in San Francisco in 1849 was 75 men to one
woman. Author Ted Marcuse has bloated the ratio
in his play to 2 to 1, presumably so the audience can
savor the sight of a sextet of leggy chorus girls.
Despite the infringement on historical accuracy, this
year's Spring Slum is an enjoyable one. Ray Ham
mett, who used to quarterback it up for the varsity in
1942. has a strong, pleasing voice, as does newcomer
Bill Burke. Dick Davis and Suzy Marion stand out
in the chorus, and Hal Burdick plumbs every ounce
ol goodness out of the show with his perceptive
direction.
CALL TO ARMS. Pierre van den Berghe, graduate
student in sociology, is a marked man.

Pierre was born in Belgium. The Belgian army is
after him. His lather was born in France, so he holds
a dual citizenship. The French army is after him.
Pierre studies at Stanford University, which is in the
United States. The United States army is after him.
All of which makes Pierre van den Brughe just
about the most popular man in the NATO.
RUDE AWAKENING. One of the brothers at the
Theta Delt house, boating on a northern Jake recently,
notioed an empty jeep roll down a hill and into the
lake, sympathized with the owner, discovered it was
his jeep.
:*t :}s $
BLESSED EVENT DEPT. Melba Wiser, like any
other girl who had just been engaged, was looking
forward to seeing her engagement announced in the
society section. Daily staff editor Ruby Bernstein,
just to help things along, phoned the engagement to
the Chronicle.
The next morning, Melba thumbed through the
society section, didn't find a notice on the engagement,
finally was told that it had been printed in the Sport
ing Green.
Moaned Melba, "I'm probably the only girl ever
to have an engagement announced on the Sporting
Green."
Responded sports editor Bill Leiser, "That's the
price for being engaged to Bob Mathias."
!» « *
ORCHIDS DEPT. A big six and a locomotive for
the decoration crew of the Toyon Formal. It's best
we've ever seen . . . more Parisian than Paris itself.
if * *
INSINCERE. Amber Spinning, who recently won
a prize in a national contest for lauding the merits
of a particular cigarette brand, doesn't smoke. The
prize was based on "Originality and SINCERITY."

FRIDAY MORNING ROUNDUP
I wa:: on my way home from a closing-out bargain
basement sale at the Sigma Nu house recently when
three guys pushed me into the bushes.
"Lissen," they chorused, "we're getting sick of it,
see!"
I stepped aside while they got sick.
"We're getting sick of opening the Daily on a
nice spring morning and seeing yo" v a,mu</

staling up at us. Why couldn't
you b» j a beautiful girl?"
"The name's Grotay," I allowed.
"All right," I shot back, "I'll
pul a picture of a beautiful girl
in next time."
"That's n hot idea," they said
coldly.
And so I hat': why Joyce Eng
blom's picture is in Bull Ses
sion this morning.

SPRING SHOW STUFF. This yea. „ Ul ,,^
"Frisco '49" is guilty of gross misrepresentation of
history. Things were tough for the men during the
gold rush days. What with a stern director of ad
missions and tough entrance requirements and all,
the ratio in San Francisco in 1849 was 75 men to one
woman. Author Ted Marcuse has bloated the ratio
in his play to 2 to 1, presumably so the audience can
savor the sight of a sextet of leggy chorus girls.
Despite the infringement on historical accuracy, this
year's Spring Slum is an enjoyable one. Ray Ham
mett, who used to quarterback it up for the varsity in
1942. has a strong, pleasing voice, as does newcomer
Bill Burke. Dick Davis and Suzy Marion stand out
in the chorus, and Hal Burdick plumbs every ounce
ol goodness out of the show with his perceptive
direction.
CALL TO ARMS. Pierre van den Berghe, graduate
student in sociology, is a marked man.

Pierre was born in Belgium. The Belgian army is
after him. His lather was born in France, so he holds
a dual citizenship. The French army is after him.
Pierre studies at Stanford University, which is in the
United States. The United States army is after him.
All of which makes Pierre van den Brughe just
about the most popular man in the NATO.
RUDE AWAKENING. One of the brothers at the
Theta Delt house, boating on a northern Jake recently,
notioed an empty jeep roll down a hill and into the
lake, sympathized with the owner, discovered it was
his jeep.

BLESSED EVENT DEPT. Melba Wiser, like any
other girl who had just been engaged, was looking
forward to seeing her engagement announced in the
society section. Daily staff editor Ruby Bernstein,
just to help things along, phoned the engagement to
the Chronicle.
The next morning, Melba thumbed through the
society section, didn't find a notice on the engagement,
finally was told that it had been printed in the Sport
ing Green.
Moaned Melba, "I'm probably the only girl ever
to have an engagement announced on the Sporting
Green."
Responded sports editor Bill Leiser, "That's the
price for being engaged to Bob Mathias."

ORCHIDS DEPT. A big six and a locomotive for
the decoration crew of the Toyon Formal. It's best
we've ever seen . . . more Parisian than Paris itself.

INSINCERE. Amber Spinning, who recently won
a prize in a national contest for lauding the merits
of a particular cigarette brand, doesn't smoke. The
prize was based on "Originality and SINCERITY."
