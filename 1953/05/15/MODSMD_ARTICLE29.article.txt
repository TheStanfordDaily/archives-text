# CAMPUS OPINION
## Apology and Statement of Purpose 
### 
To the Editor:
Wo on (lie Con Home Drive wish to apologize for
the luck of food for those who arrived late at the Con
Home Barbecue last Wednesday. This deficiency was
not intentional hut due to a number of factors, not
the least of which was finances. The Barbecue is the
non-profit activity of the week; all the money we
received from the dining halls was spent on food. The
amount was insufficient. The dining halls, for example,
allow only fifty cents per person for an average
number of persons for a Wednesday dinner; this
makes it extremely difficult to serve a barbecued beef
dinner lot everyone. Around 5:40, with rain clouds
threatening and with dwindling lines, it seemed that
we would have too much food and so seconds were
pivrn to those who purchased a second ticket. At (i
another wave arrived and the food was gone. Ac
» ntding to our estimates there were 4,500 attending,
far above any previous record. Next year we plan a
correspondingly greater food allowance and hope for
greater financial assistance from the dining halls.
As for the puipose of the Barbecue, it is not a
charity dinner but is designed to have the campus see
the Con Home and meet the children who are re
ceiving the students' help. We feel that anyone who
saw the Con Home kids and the Stanford students
eating together at the Barbecue and heard the chil
dren ask. "When are you coming back to see us?"
could hardly doubt the purpose of the event. In this
activity we are trying to make friends for the home,
not money. There are a number of ways in which
the students can and do help give the children a well
rounded life such as Sunday School teaching and
monthly entertainment s'hows, and a Boy Scout
troop. The enthusiasm for Stanford among thr chil
dren is evident in their red and white bows and
.shirts, their singing of Stanford songs and yells, and
theii following of Stanford games

Mrs. Sterling is a prominent member of the Senior
Auxiliary which constantly works to support the
Home. Dr. and Mrs. Sterling made a special effort
to attend the Barbecue and I am sure would have no
difficulty in explaining to any "distinguished visitors"
the purpose of this unique activity designed to give
children Stanford friendships as well as material aid.

Driver (louii<\sy
To the Editor:
Courteous drivers are the exception rather than
the rule on the Stanford campus. Everyone is in a
hurry to get somewhere and evidently is unconcerned
as to how he does so.
On Wednesday, someone backed out of a parking
space behind Mem Aud and wrought havoc with the
rear fender on my little '40 Chev coupe. It's a person
able, friendly little car, and was naturally hurt and
upset, as my waliet will be. I have cooled off some
what by now and am not seeking ihe culprit any
longer with blood in my eve and vengeance in my
heart. But, please, on behalf of my littie car, bloody
but unbowed, and my empty wallet, couldn't we all
start to drive more courteously and carefully?
A little sympathy from all those with little cars
and empty wallets will be greatly appreciated Thank
you. JOEL ROGOSIN

able, friendly little car, and was naturally hurt and
upset, as my waliet will be. I have cooled off some
what by now and am not seeking ihe culprit any
longer with blood in my eve and vengeance in my
heart. But, please, on behalf of my littie car, bloody
but unbowed, and my empty wallet, couldn't we all
start to drive more courteously and carefully?
A little sympathy from all those with little cars
and empty wallets will be greatly appreciated Thank
you. JOEL ROGOSIN
To the Editor:
Wo on (lie Con Home Drive wish to apologize for
the luck of food for those who arrived late at the Con
Home Barbecue last Wednesday. This deficiency was
not intentional hut due to a number of factors, not
the least of which was finances. The Barbecue is the
non-profit activity of the week; all the money we
received from the dining halls was spent on food. The
amount was insufficient. The dining halls, for example,
allow only fifty cents per person for an average
number of persons for a Wednesday dinner; this
makes it extremely difficult to serve a barbecued beef
dinner lot everyone. Around 5:40, with rain clouds
threatening and with dwindling lines, it seemed that
we would have too much food and so seconds were
pivrn to those who purchased a second ticket. At (i
another wave arrived and the food was gone. Ac
» ntding to our estimates there were 4,500 attending,
far above any previous record. Next year we plan a
correspondingly greater food allowance and hope for
greater financial assistance from the dining halls.
As for the puipose of the Barbecue, it is not a
charity dinner but is designed to have the campus see
the Con Home and meet the children who are re
ceiving the students' help. We feel that anyone who
saw the Con Home kids and the Stanford students
eating together at the Barbecue and heard the chil
dren ask. "When are you coming back to see us?"
could hardly doubt the purpose of the event. In this
activity we are trying to make friends for the home,
not money. There are a number of ways in which
the students can and do help give the children a well
rounded life such as Sunday School teaching and
monthly entertainment s'hows, and a Boy Scout
troop. The enthusiasm for Stanford among thr chil
dren is evident in their red and white bows and
.shirts, their singing of Stanford songs and yells, and
theii following of Stanford games

Mrs. Sterling is a prominent member of the Senior
Auxiliary which constantly works to support the
Home. Dr. and Mrs. Sterling made a special effort
to attend the Barbecue and I am sure would have no
difficulty in explaining to any "distinguished visitors"
the purpose of this unique activity designed to give
children Stanford friendships as well as material aid.

To the Editor:
Courteous drivers are the exception rather than
the rule on the Stanford campus. Everyone is in a
hurry to get somewhere and evidently is unconcerned
as to how he does so.
On Wednesday, someone backed out of a parking
space behind Mem Aud and wrought havoc with the
rear fender on my little '40 Chev coupe. It's a person
able, friendly little car, and was naturally hurt and
upset, as my waliet will be. I have cooled off some
what by now and am not seeking ihe culprit any
longer with blood in my eve and vengeance in my
heart. But, please, on behalf of my littie car, bloody
