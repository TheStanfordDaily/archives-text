# Swimmers Fare Cal
## 
### DON STEPHENS 
The Indian swimmers, whfb
have trounced every opponent
in their path to the PCC crown,
will have to overcome an ad
versary much stronger than
their opponent tomorrow — the
Golden Bears they'll have to
overcome the stigma oI over
confidence.
Conquerors of the Bears three
weeks ago ; 55-29, in a meet in the
local pool which saw the Cards vie-,
torious in 10 out of eleven events,
most experts look for a letdown
against an improved Cal squad to
morrow morning at 10 a.m. in the
Hearst pool. The Bears won the
400 yard relay because of a faulty
start by Stanford.
More fuel to the pyre of optimism
can be found in the team's composite
statistics.
Currently riding along with 24
straight dual meet wins, the In
have amassed a total of 452 points
((>.'! point average) to 147 for their
opponents (21 point average).
Stanford in this 3(> year old se-
J lies has fun up a record of 38 vic
tories to live defeats. The schools
have met twice each season since
1947.
Last weekend the Indians and
j Bears teamed up on consecutive days
I to whip a depth-less Bruin squad
j6l to 23. The Cards, however, took
j out their top men to make room for ;
the men who place and show consist
ently.
To take advantage of this optimism, i
Cal is counting heavily on Alan I
Lauderback to come back to his '
PCC 200- meter freestyle victory I
j form.
Stanford's Don Oshorn, with
victories in the 22(1 and 440 free
styles in the last Cal meet, is ex
pected to better 2:12.Sand 4:40.
respectively in his specialties.
Spectators at tomorrow's meet may
see a repetition of the Jerry Hayes-
Ashlev Jones dual in the 200-yard
breast stroke in which Cal almost
scored its only legitimate win. Hays I
! had a clear - cut three - yard lead
ovei Jones going into the final lap.
However, Hays couldn't match Jones' i
; phenomenal closing drive, and had i
t6 relegate himself to a limping, ex
hausted second place.
Jim Gaughran, Stanford's most '
[ versatile swimmer, swimming a j
different style for each 50 yards, is ■
; favored to win the 150 yard medley, j
| He won in 1:36.4 last time out against
I Cal.
In the 100 yard freestyle, Jim Lee i
and Lee Gunnerson are expected to {
repeat their previous one-two per- 1
| formance, while Burt Holiday should
: garner a win in the 50 yard sprint.
Churning the water in 2:16.4, John j
; Weiser windmilled himself into a
i first place in the 220-yard back
stroke over the Bear's Jim Ross and
j Walt Becker in the Cal debacle and
j should repeat.
Larry Heim will probably go in
! the anchor lap of the 300-yard med- '
ley.
The Card freshmen should make
repeating their 4S ,^-., J4 1 - shellack
ing of the Cuhs.
The lineup:
30(1 medley—Weiser, Clenians,
Koll.
200 free—Osborne, Lee.
