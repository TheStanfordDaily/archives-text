# Card Nine Faces Cal In Two Crucial Games
## Pennant at Stake in Sunken Diamond Today at 3:15; Teams at Berkeley Tomorrow 
### DON WEBSTER 
With the pennant riding on every pitch, Stanford's varsity base
ballers round the final turn of the 1953 baseball s&ason and head
into the home stretch with a pair of games against California. Start
ing time this afternoon in the Sunken Diamond is 3:15, with the
final game of the PCC race at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon in Berkeley.

With the dual-Jeague setup that
currently exi .l , Stan-lord has
cinched a tie in Southern Division
play, and a victory in either contest
this weekend will give the Indians
the flag, in the CIBA race, Everett
Dean's nine needs to take both tilts
to cinch a tie.
The object of it all is an invita
tion to torn pete against the North
ern Division champion for the
Western Division NCAA berth.
Winning that would mean a trip
to Omaha for the national cham
pionship competition.
Bob Murphy has been nominated
to start on the hill today to face A 1
Mathews of the Bears. The pair
have met two times this season. The
first meeting saw a 7-1 victory for
Murphy. In the second contest,
staged last Saturday, Murphy was
not yet recovered from an attack of
pleurisy, and left the tilt after the
first; inning.
Phil Page will hurl Saturday at
Edwards Field. Starting for the
Bears will lie Joe Gaggcro.
At one time not too long ago
the Indians were regarded as a
cinch lor the pennant. A slump
which has seen Stanford lose
three of their last four league
games lias tightened the race. It
now takes any combination of two
Card wins or Trojan defeats to
gain the flag.
USC faces Santa Clara this weeki-
end, so there is little they can do
about influencing the Southern Di
vision race. Their only PCC gamt
left is next Tuesday against UCLA
Though Stanford had been in a
battin" slump the 1 t few weeks, it
seemed as if it was rroken Tues
day when the Cards scored eight
run in one inning agaihst Sacra
mento State.
Dean has been especially im
pressed with the hitting and fielding
of third sacker Hay Swarts. ''Ray
has been coming up with some
beautiful pi ( y , at third base. H
Ins also shown real ability as a
clutch hitter, too." Swart drove in
both Stanford runs against Santa
Clara la t week with a boom in ;
double witii in the ninth.
The be.-t improvement at the plate
ricently has been Warren Good
rich. "Warren looks like the cl?.s
of the CIBA short tops. His hitting
has been important in Stanford vic
tories. He lead , the ieague in stolen
bases and tops the team in total
hits, Dean said.
Tomorrow's contest is the last
regularly scheduled game at the
Sunken Diamond. Should Stanford
win the invitation, they would face
the Northern Division winner
(probably Oregon State) here on
May 29 and 30.

Though Stanford had been in a
battin" slump the 1 t few weeks, it
seemed as if it was rroken Tues
day when the Cards scored eight
run in one inning agaihst Sacra
mento State.
Dean has been especially im
pressed with the hitting and fielding
of third sacker Hay Swarts. ''Ray
has been coming up with some
beautiful pi ( y , at third base. H
Ins also shown real ability as a
clutch hitter, too." Swart drove in
both Stanford runs against Santa
Clara la t week with a boom in ;
double witii in the ninth.
The be.-t improvement at the plate
ricently has been Warren Good
rich. "Warren looks like the cl?.s
of the CIBA short tops. His hitting
has been important in Stanford vic
tories. He lead , the ieague in stolen
bases and tops the team in total
hits, Dean said.
Tomorrow's contest is the last
regularly scheduled game at the
Sunken Diamond. Should Stanford
win the invitation, they would face
the Northern Division winner
(probably Oregon State) here on
May 29 and 30.

With the pennant riding on every pitch, Stanford's varsity base
ballers round the final turn of the 1953 baseball s&ason and head
into the home stretch with a pair of games against California. Start
ing time this afternoon in the Sunken Diamond is 3:15, with the
final game of the PCC race at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon in Berkeley.

With the dual-Jeague setup that
currently exi .l , Stan-lord has
cinched a tie in Southern Division
play, and a victory in either contest
this weekend will give the Indians
the flag, in the CIBA race, Everett
Dean's nine needs to take both tilts
to cinch a tie.
The object of it all is an invita
tion to torn pete against the North
ern Division champion for the
Western Division NCAA berth.
Winning that would mean a trip
to Omaha for the national cham
pionship competition.
Bob Murphy has been nominated
to start on the hill today to face A 1
Mathews of the Bears. The pair
have met two times this season. The
first meeting saw a 7-1 victory for
Murphy. In the second contest,
staged last Saturday, Murphy was
not yet recovered from an attack of
pleurisy, and left the tilt after the
first; inning.
Phil Page will hurl Saturday at
Edwards Field. Starting for the
Bears will lie Joe Gaggcro.
At one time not too long ago
the Indians were regarded as a
cinch lor the pennant. A slump
which has seen Stanford lose
three of their last four league
games lias tightened the race. It
now takes any combination of two
Card wins or Trojan defeats to
gain the flag.
USC faces Santa Clara this weeki-
end, so there is little they can do
about influencing the Southern Di
vision race. Their only PCC gamt
left is next Tuesday against UCLA
