# Card Nine Faces Cal In Two Crucial Games
## Pennant at Stake in Sunken Diamond Today at 3:15; Teams at Berkeley Tomorrow 
### DON WEBSTER 
With the pennant riding on every pitch, Stanford's varsity base
ballers round the final turn of the 1953 baseball s&ason and head
into the home stretch with a pair of games against California. Start
ing time this afternoon in the Sunken Diamond is 3:15, with the
final game of the PCC race at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon in Berkeley.

With the dual-Jeague setup that
currently exi .l , Stan-lord has
cinched a tie in Southern Division
play, and a victory in either contest
this weekend will give the Indians
the flag, in the CIBA race, Everett
Dean's nine needs to take both tilts
to cinch a tie.
The object of it all is an invita
tion to torn pete against the North
ern Division champion for the
Western Division NCAA berth.
Winning that would mean a trip
to Omaha for the national cham
pionship competition.
Bob Murphy has been nominated
to start on the hill today to face A 1
Mathews of the Bears. The pair
have met two times this season. The
first meeting saw a 7-1 victory for
Murphy. In the second contest,
staged last Saturday, Murphy was
not yet recovered from an attack of
pleurisy, and left the tilt after the
first; inning.
Phil Page will hurl Saturday at
Edwards Field. Starting for the
Bears will lie Joe Gaggcro.
At one time not too long ago
the Indians were regarded as a
cinch lor the pennant. A slump
which has seen Stanford lose
three of their last four league
games lias tightened the race. It
now takes any combination of two
Card wins or Trojan defeats to
gain the flag.
