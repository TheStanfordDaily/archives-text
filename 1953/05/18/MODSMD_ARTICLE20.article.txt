# Clouds Mar '56 Exchange
## 
### 
1 The C'al-Stanford frosh exchange
took place Saturday despite threat
ening skies, a cold wind, and a gen
eral confusion on the part of all in
volved in the event.
From the time that the sun first
didn't appear above the horizon it
seemed that all hopes for a success
ful exchange between the two cam
puses was futile, and class officers
spent the morning trying to formu
late plans for a "singing in the rain"
theme to the affair.
By 2 the ground was still dry,
however, and some 70 California
representatives in garb ranging from
bathing suits to sweaters and scarfs
joined the Stanford class at Lake
Lag. Cal seemefl to be the more at
home in the aquatic element, as the
visitors took all of the contests ex
cept for a women's gunneling race
between Eileen Conaghan and Cal
frosh proxy Barbara Hamilton.
By 5:'50 the clouds had broken and
a picnic dinner was served on the
women's athletic field by the Roble
girls.
A softball game was played con
currently with the meal.
Barbara Hamilton led the classes
in a song-fest of such California fa
forites as the "Cal Drinking Song''
and "Johnny O."
Wind-up of the day's activities
was a dance held in the Women's
Gym.
