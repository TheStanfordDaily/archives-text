### DON WEBSTER 
Looking like the team of old, Stanford's baseball nine defeated
j California Friday, 9-6, to win the PCC Southern Division titlo
and a chance to compete for the NCAA District 8 title. On Satur
day, the Indians lost to the Bears, 4-3, at Berkeley.
Whether the Cards win tomorrow against Santa Clara will do

cidc whether they will have to face
USC for the privilege of represent,
ing California against Oregon Stat".
USC, which defeated the Bron
cos twice this weekend, is now
tied with the Cards in CIBA play.
The Trojans face UCLA tomor
row, and if they are still tied
with Stanford after that game
Everett Dean's nine will no doubt
get the selection.
If USC is ahead, then the NCAA,
selection comittee will decide
whether the four league wins the
Cards had over the Trojans are suf
ficient to decide the representative,
or whether a playoff is neces:-;iry
next weekend.
Stanford can decide it all, of
course, by winning tomorrow.
Pitcher Bob Murphy appeared
fully recovered from his pleuri y
attack in winning the first contest.
Especially pleasing to the fans
was Jack Shepard, who broke hi.
batting slump. He registered a trio
of hits in both games. His biggest
blow came in the first inning Fri -
day after Rich Scramaglia h d
walked and Warren Goodrich sin •
gled. A booming tripfe to right •
center scored two. and Shepurd also
scored on a hit. by Chuck Essegian.
Three walks, a single by Al
boy, and Shepard's second base
blow netted the thrci tallies in tlv
second frame. A trio of walks, a fly
out, a sacrifice, and Goodrich's sec
ond single scored the final thro
runs in the fifth inning.
Murphy was actually more cf
fective than tho final score ind»
rated. Only two of the Bear runs
were earned. Four Stanford errors
were offset by Murphy's hurling
Friday, but three more miscucs
cost Phil Page the game the fol
lowing day, along with a bit of
faulty umpiring.
The Cards opened up in Mic first
with a run on another walk to Sci . •
maglia, a stolen base, and the first
of three solid singles by Shepard.
In running to first, though, the bu;
catcher turned his ankle, for he
limped badly the rest of the gami-.
A walk and an error put Ctil run
ners on second and third with non ■
out. in their half of the first. With
a three - and - one count on Dick
Ament, a high pitch by Page wa .
called a strike. The break turned
out to be a good one for Cal, though,
for on the next pitch Ament. douh
led to score two runs. Had he only
