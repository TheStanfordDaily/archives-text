# STANFORD — TODAY AND TOMORROW
## Officials Answer Queries On Research vs. Teaching 
### WIN GRIFFITH 
(Ed. note—This is another arti
cle in the "Stanford—Today anjl
tomorrow *■ cries being offered by
the Daily as a part of the current
student information program. The
articles have discussed University
finances and (he buildings and land
development program and continue
now with the general subject of
academics.)

"Why.rnust a part of my $G6O
tuition payment pay for a pro
fessor whose antiquated lec
tures do nothing but satisfy aca
demic requirements?"
"Why does the University
emphasise stafl research to the
extent that the "teaching" of
many professors fails to satisfy
or even interest many students?"
These are questions which students
have been administration
leaders in the discussion periods of
tin "Stanford Today and Tomor
row' talks and in private confer
ences between students and Uni
versity officials.
They are questions which have
b< i'm prompted by the recent issue
on the dismissal of Dr. Alfred Sum
net o! the Geography Department,
an i: sue which has focused atten
tion on the University's policy in the
biond and general realm of educa

' lion.
, Thai policy, as expressed by var
ious university officials, is based
on the premise thai a university
i has more than one function, thai
it owes a "moral obligation" to the
J society of which it is a part.
Says Dr. Ray Faulkner, acting
| dean of Humanities and Sciences:
"The high school has one specific
function teaching. The university
must go beyond a rigid line of in
struction. It must advance the whole
realm of know/ledge. It owes a moral
obligation to society to improve so
ciety."
And that improvement, Stanford's
officers say, in the result of research,
or what the University prefers to
call "creative endeavors."
In addition to the '"moral obliga
tion," the University lists the fol
lowing reasons for its stress on re
search:
1. A correlation between research
and teaching effectiveness. Stan
ford leaders believe that the pro
fessor who is engaged in individual
research will also be able to pre
sent his subject to students with
j greater effectiveness.
2. The desire to train students' to
I think independently and by their
i own research and investigation to
j act independently. The fac u 1 I y
J should exemplify those traits.
The "happiness" of the Universi
j ly staff. The University operates on
i the assumption that each faculty

member is happier and more satis
lied with his profession if he is en
gaged in independent work. To gain
the respect of the rest of the staff
members and the students, the lacu
ty member should "keep up with the
staff research induced by a univer
sity atmosphere."
4. The reputation of the Univer
sity in the nation. To attract the
best men to its staff and the best stu
dents to its classrooms, Sanford must
make a name for itelf in research.
If a' lecturer in music composes a
symphony, if a professor of English
publishes a novel, if a doctor in the
medical school develops a treatment
for cancer, the reputation of the uni
versity will improve. In the end, the
student himself will benefit.
President Sterling and all other
University officials involved in the
hiring of the University's faculty
will stress the intention of hiring
men who are both potential teach
ers and researchers. There is no
particular edge given to research
potential in the selection of the
faculty, University leaders say.
"We want men who can offer the
most to Stanford," Dean Faulkner
says."And to get those men, we
must offer security of position anil
freedom to express individual
ideas."
"Unlike industrial and commercial
concerns," Faulkner adds, "we will
not release a man for ineffective
teaching."

realm of know/ledge. It owes a moral
obligation to society to improve so
ciety."
And that improvement, Stanford's
officers say, in the result of research,
or what the University prefers to
call "creative endeavors."
In addition to the '"moral obliga
tion," the University lists the fol
lowing reasons for its stress on re
search:
1. A correlation between research
and teaching effectiveness. Stan
ford leaders believe that the pro
fessor who is engaged in individual
research will also be able to pre
sent his subject to students with
j greater effectiveness.
2. The desire to train students' to
I think independently and by their
i own research and investigation to
j act independently. The fac u 1 I y
J should exemplify those traits.
The "happiness" of the Universi
j ly staff. The University operates on
i the assumption that each faculty

member is happier and more satis
lied with his profession if he is en
gaged in independent work. To gain
the respect of the rest of the staff
members and the students, the lacu
ty member should "keep up with the
staff research induced by a univer
sity atmosphere."
4. The reputation of the Univer
sity in the nation. To attract the
best men to its staff and the best stu
dents to its classrooms, Sanford must
make a name for itelf in research.
If a' lecturer in music composes a
symphony, if a professor of English
publishes a novel, if a doctor in the
medical school develops a treatment
for cancer, the reputation of the uni
versity will improve. In the end, the
student himself will benefit.
President Sterling and all other
University officials involved in the
hiring of the University's faculty
will stress the intention of hiring
men who are both potential teach
ers and researchers. There is no
particular edge given to research
potential in the selection of the
faculty, University leaders say.
"We want men who can offer the
most to Stanford," Dean Faulkner
says."And to get those men, we
must offer security of position anil
freedom to express individual
ideas."
"Unlike industrial and commercial
concerns," Faulkner adds, "we will
not release a man for ineffective
teaching."
