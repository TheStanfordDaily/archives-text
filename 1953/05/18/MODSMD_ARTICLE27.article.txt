### BARBIE TUERK 
\ »• WITH APATITY California's
"Pelican" is all for the Student
Apathy Committee they say has
been formed on the Berkeley cam
pus.
"The idea that one should always
be tunning around going to classes,
attending rallies and meetings, and
organizing committees is a subver
sive one planted at the beginning of
the Industrial Revolution by the
IBM trust which is seeking to wear
human beings out entirely and re
place them with machines," the Cal
humor magazine claims.
"The Pelican" would like to see
committee rooms and schoolrooms
replaced with apathy rooms where
students could all go just to sit.

bird recently at the University of
Michigan They began lining up at

2:30 a.m. to file their applications
for rooms at Hobbs House, the only
university women's residence that
serves meals three times a day.
Michigan has no number-draw
ing system like Stanford's; instead. !
it places women on a first-come
first-served basis. Only nine places
were available in Hobbs House, so
anyone arriving after 3:30 a.m. was
too late.
