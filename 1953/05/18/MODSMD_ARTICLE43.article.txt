j thrown out on a disputed play at

s:iw a see-saw, wide-open, scoring
struggle, but from that point on
Young and Slack held complete con
trol.
Young took over for starter A 1
Dunn with one out in the third and
faced only 26 batters the rest of the
way as he got 23 outs. Slack held
Stanford hitless after Jim McDow
ell's pinch-hit single in the fifth.
The Papooses got their start in
the first frame on George Selleck's
walk, Ron Wagner's sacrifice, and
Rocky Furst's soft single to cen
ter. But Cal took over the lc:yl
with a pair of tallies in the bot
tom half, Dunn contributed a
walk and a throwing error, and

Dick Musser clubbed a double.
Stanford surged to the front again
\ in the third. Dunn walked, Selleck
I singled on a bunt, and Wagner sac
! rificed once more to set up the
j scoring. One run counted on Micky
Holzman's single and another when
Neil Papiano walked with the bases
loaded.
The rally died when Holzman was
j thrown out on a disputed play at
(he plate as he attempted to score
1 on a short passed ball.
Cal knocked Dunn from the
j mound in the third, tallying four
! runs before Young could come in
I from left field to get the side out.
i Two singles, a walk, and two errors
S caused the trouble.
Stanford completed the scoring
with three tying markers in the
fifth. Wagner singled, Furst doub
i led over the left fielder's head, and
Papiano walked to fill the bases.
Young strolled to push Wagner
home, McDowell rapped the first
pitch for his pinch - hit single to
score Furst, and Papiano raced in
on a passed ball.—B. W.
