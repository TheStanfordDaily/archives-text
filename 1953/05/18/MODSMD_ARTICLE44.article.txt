# Gridders in Hard Scrum
## 
### 
Don Sanders and Bob Garrett
starred in a scrimmage last Satur
day in the ScanTord Stadium. A
good crowd watched 74 players
participate in what Coach Taylor
labeled a "hard - driving, bruising
scrimmage."
Sanders, star safety man on
the 15151 Rose Bowl team and in
eligible last year, showed plenty
of power in toting the ball and
seems destined to see a lot of
duty in next year's one-platoon
play.
Garrett won the first round in the
battle of the quarterbacks with hi.s
steady signal-calling and passing.
The longest run of the day was an
85-yard punt return by Dave Cas
tellucci. Halfback Bill Rogers tal
lied on a 40-yard interception. Oth
er touchdowns were tallied by Jack
Gebert, iullback Bill Wentworlh,
who has been a surprise star of the
spring drills, and halfback Ernie
Dorn.
Up front, Win Wedge. Sam
Motley, Jerry Goldberg, Roy
Krikeherg, and John Stanton
stood out.
Stanford will conclude their
spring workouts next Saturday.
