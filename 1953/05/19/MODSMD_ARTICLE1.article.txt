# CIBA DECISION TODAY
## Baseball Crown Rides on Today's Card-Bronco Tilt 
### PHIL HERMAN 
Tho official end to Iho Stan
ford baseball season comes thin
afternoon at Washington Park
in Santa Clara with Coach Ever
ett Dean's nine playing Santa
Clara in its most important game
of the year.
Game time is 2, Stanford stu
dents will be admitted free upon
presentation of student body cards.
It is hoped that this afternoon's
tilt will .settle the championship of
the California Intercollegiate Base
hall Association. Stanford and USC
are currently tied for the top spot
in the league with !• and (i records.
But there arc so many ifs in- ,
volvcd that no one for sure kno\v<>
if anything will lie decided today,
especially the NCAA District
Eight bid for the NCAA cham
pionship baseball tournament. The
only thin,* certain is that the
Cards i.ve the PCC champions,
having clinched that title against
Cal I .iday.
This afternoon USC is playing
UCLA in Los Angeles in their final
league game, and should they and
Stanford both win, or both lose, the
CIBA will end up in a tie and the
Indians will be awarded
the title. T ™
However, if the Trojans win and
the Cards lose, thus giving USC the
CIBA crown, then the NCAA Dis
trict Eight selection committee will
have to decide whether the four
league wins the Indians chalked up
against USC are sufficient to de
termine whether playoff should
be held between the two.
Stanford of course can end all
this speculation l>.v winning today
while CSC loses. Thus the NCAA
District Eight representative will
prohahly he the winner of (he
I'CC North-South playoff.
Coach Everett, Dean has an
nounced that he will go with his ace
Bob Murphy against the Broncs to
day.
Murphy, the big winner in the
CIBA with a 7-1 mark, showed that
he was fully recovered from his
muscle pull and a pleurisy attack
suffered 10 days ago, when he
pitched the Indians to their 112) to fi
PCC clinching win over Cal last
Friday.
Murphy has won 10 and lost two
and held batters to a .217 mark
against him. He has fanned 82 bat
ters. It's no wonder that Dean has
decided to go with the bespectacled
right-hander.
Coach Dean announced the se
lection of Murphy by saying:
"Wc think Boh, on his fine per
formance this year, can heat San-


LONC ON SHORT—Warren Goodrich, hustling little shortstop
for the championship (?) Indians, will be an important gun in
Stanford's fight for the title today against Santa Clara. A demon
on the base paths as well as at bat and on the field, Goodrich
will be out to repeat his record-shaltering performance of steal
nig four bases against the Broncos as he did earlier this season.

ta Clara. We know lit* can do it.
"All the boys on the team know
ihat they will have to be playing
top baseball to win. And I'm sure
that every one will be playing top
ba.-eball today."
Dean also announced that he will
use his regular starting lineup tliis
afternoon.
Don Seybold, a tall curve-ball
ing right-hander, will probably be
on Ihe bill for Santa Clara today.
Don already holds two decisions
over the Cards this season, beat
ing them 7 to A and !> to 2 in ten
innings.
Although the Broncs are tied for
Inst in the CIBA with UCLA, they
have a hard-hitting club.
Dick Camilli, left fielder, and Gus
Suhr, Jr., at first base, are two of
the top men in the loop.
However, their catching ranks as
the league's worst, and their pitch
ing after Seybold is pretty spotty.
A good thing to remember
about Washington Park is that
Stanford bus never lost a CIBA
game there, while last season
Murphy pitched one of his finest
games as he one-bitted the Broncs
.'} to 0. Earlier this season Bob
won by an 8 to (i score there.

FANCY FIELDER—First baseman Hal Hennacy, has been one
of the bulwarks of the Stanford infield this season. Hal, a senior,
has saved many an infielder from errors with his fine catches
around the initial sack. He has also been one of the most consist
ent hitters on the Card nine, far better than his . 269 season aver
age indicates. —Daily photo by Vern Dunn
