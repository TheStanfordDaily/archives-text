# A 						Forthright Statement
## 
### 
The Stanford chapter of the American Asso
ciation of University Professors, made up of
'/j(J of the top members of the Stanford faculty,
issued a forthright statement yesterday that
strikes fiurd at the heart of the current congres
sional investigations into education.
We heartily applaud the statement, for it is
the first time in our memory that Stanford pro
fessors have taken a stand on such a contro
versial issue in an off-election year.
Unlike some statements on the problem is
sued of late, it diaws the issue in uncompromis
ing blacks and whites.
"We strongly deplore the current investi
gations into the political opinions and asso
ciations ot university professors, and the use
o/ congressional and legislative authority for
such investigations," the statement reads.
We feel that it is time that Stanford adds its
voice to the other colleges to that of Columbia
and Princeton and others in the fight against
the current, reckless brand of investigations.
In our opinion, the nation's educational lead
ers have held back too long in making a force
ful declaration about the investigations.
Educators have sat by retiringly while the

congressional investigators have extended
their power of smear and demagoguery.
but apparently a large segment of Stanford
professors are willing to sit by no longer.
Their statement is definitive and hard-hitting.
It minces no words.
It charges that the investigations are stunting
free inguiry and promoting a degeneration of
the guality of teaching, both sad indictments.
The emphatic language of the statement is
a welcome relief the statement issued in
March by the American Association of Uni
versities.
That statement concerned itself with aca
demic freedom and responsibility. It dealt with
abstractions, with fine words and polished
phrases. It did not strike at the heart of the
problem—the ever-widening power of the con
gressional investigating committees.
The Stanford AA U P statement boldly
chaiges that the investigations are dangerous
and harmful and should be ended.
That is the kind of concrete statement that
stirs action. And action on this problem of in
vestigations is long, long overdue.
