# McCarthy—The Crux
## 
### 
Many of the educators considering the prob
lem oi academic freedom and the current con
gressional investigation in education seeni to
us to be missing the essential crux of the prob
lem Senator Joe McCarthy.
For the Wisconsinite is not only the origin
ator, but the leading protagonist of the current
investigation into alleged subversion.
Though he is not immediately involved in
the investigation of education, he has said he
would conduct such an inguiry if other con
gressional bloodhounds refused io do so.
He is the guiding spirit behind the current
swing to the supra-American right.
And though many of the protesting state
ments issued by educators will be directed to
him, he will take little note of them, if his past
conduct is any key. For he has consistently
snubbed all authority that has stood contrary
to his unflagging ambition.
McCarthy is not interested in statements on
academic freedom as such. He is not a theorist,
he i:j a politician interested in one thing, ap
parently, and that is the Presidency.
His attempt "to flush out the Commies" is
merely d facade for his ambition. It is hot a
::oul-felt ideal open to challenge or question.
He has indicated his ambitious intent time
and again this year:
1. He has deliberately interfered with foreign
policy negotiations the Greek shipping con
troversy.
2. He has openly challenged his party lead
ers the Bohlen affair.

■
3. He blatantly attacked our propaganda
warfare effort Voice of America investiga-!
tions.
4. He has recklessly endangered relations
with our Allies —the recent verbal exchange
with Clement Atlee of Great Britain.
5. He has tried to silence criticism from the
press — the investigation of Editor James*
Wechsles of the New York Post.
It's this ambition that the educators and ;
others interested in a democratic America must
combat. ,
There will be no convincing McCarthy by
the force of reason or logic or appeal to Amer
ica's democratic tradition. Instead, the Ameri
can people must see that McCarthy is not re
tained in office, that he is either impeached
and ousted or not re-elected when he runs in
1958.
The only appeal a man of McCarthy's ilk
understands is political, direct and hard.
Theiefore, the appeal must be directed to
ward his J constituents, at the people who put
him in office. And it must be a sensible appeal,
backed with cold, indisputable facts.
And who can better offer the facts than the
educators? Who better can study the issue and
understand its ramifications than they?
It's up to them to transmit their findings and
ideas to their students and to the public through
statements similar to the one issued yesterday
by the Stanford chapter of the American Asso
ciation of University Professors.
