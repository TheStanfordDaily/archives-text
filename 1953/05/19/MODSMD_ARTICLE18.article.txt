The following is the statement adopted Ijisl week
l>y t!»«• Stanford chapter of the American Associ
ation of University Professors.
"Teaching and research require an atmosphere of
intellectual freedom. Truth is not confined to popular
ideas, nor can its pursuit lx' circumscribed by cur
rently fashionable methods of inquiry Students must
not be deprived of the opportunity to exercise
their judgment on the competing views that are
important in many fields.
"It fullows that a university cannot fulfill its func
tion if freedom of inquiry and freedom of discussion
an. l inhibited by the possibility that unpopular opin
ions and findings may be penalized.
"The necessary qualifications of a university pro
fessor are diligence, competence, honesty and integ
nty in research and teaching. Mis colleagues are best
fitted to judge the* e qualifications. This principle has
long btcn recognized in the teaching profession.
The Present Danger
T 1 c current concern over communism has be
' oiik the occasion for numerous investigations by
ii on out ide the universities into the political
opinions and associations of university professors.
"Whatever the motives for such investigations, there
< n be no question as to their principal effect. Aware
i.t • of the investigator, the Informer, and the in

quisitor is spreading on the nation's campuses. State
ments and findings are examined and reexamined in
the light ol their possible use by outside investigators.
In such an atmosphere freedom of discussion and
freedom of inquiry are stunted, the quality of teach
ing degenerates, and the pursuit of truth is inhibited.
"These effects are not conjectural or potential, but
can already be observed on many campuses and have
been reported in the press. Nor is the evil confined
to the universities. In a democracy, limitations on
free discussion and the pursuit of truth, particularly
in the social sciences, must inevitably affect the health
of the b'.dv politic. The use of governmental authority
for the investigation of opinions represents a. danger
ous departure from traditional American principles.
"The investigations that have these damaging effects
cannot b<- defended on the grounds that unfit or un
desirable teachers abound in the universities. Uni
versity faculties are maintaining the highest level of
competence and integrity among their members, and
their record can only be impaired by the intervention
of outside investigators.
Conclusion
"We strongly deplore the current investigations into
the political opinions and associations of university
professors, and the use of congressional and legis
lative authority for such investigations."
