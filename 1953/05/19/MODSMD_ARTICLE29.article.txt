Simon, the VliJe, ihe f>ii» Meet
O
Roll out the velvet carpet. The Big Meet, granddaddy of California
track, is just around the corner. Next Saturday, thousands of track fans
will roll over the Bay Bridge to Berltelsy land and Edwards Track Stadiun>
t<< see what will probably be one ol the closest, hair-raising dual meets
ever hc.-l<l between the two schools.
The Bears, out to avenge last year's <!I -70 defeat, have almost a com
pletely veteran team with to challenge Stanford's Northern Cali
fornia supremacy. It will be close, down to the wire, and the eventual
verdict will depend on whether or not Stanford can return to her mid*
season form.
And herein lies the story. It is ;i known fact that Stanford's team, with
th exceptions of Howie Hertz and a few others, just didn't show up over !

the weekeniX Stanford's much
li< raided rnednW relay team folded
in the stretch Vis Bob Heed ran a
fail 11l 1.'52f) and Bob Simon ran
a worse than lair 4:27.8. In the Col
i; > urn Relays the night before. Simon
held down the tail end of the open
mile with a 4:28. Earlier in the sea
son Bob clocked ;i 4:l!i.y and has a
4 12.8 on the record books from last
year.
Meanwhile, Cal has two distance
ares by the name of Lon Spurrier
and Len Simpson consistent around
4 IV il they try. In the long race, Bob
Reed will be expected to hold down
the two-mile against Jim Maddox
and Roland Lar.gley, Both are capa
ble of clocking in the 9:3o's il they

have luck. Reed is 10 seconds off his 1052 mean of 9:24. and has been
coasting in in the 9:3o's all season.
And yet. we feel confident that Stanford w ill take a first, place in each
of these events. Our reasoning — Heed hasn't been pressed this season
to anywhere near his potential. Simon, on the other hand, has been pressed
right out of the picture in his last four outings. He ran a beautiful mile |
and SXO against SC. and then tried (and failed) to come hack in the two
mile—a near impossible feat. The next weekend, against Oxy, he tried
fit break his own two-mile mark of 9:1!) and folded completely, running
the race closer to 10: than to anything. Then came the medley relay |
at Fresno—the team came in second and first in the college class, but
Simon squeaked through with approximately a 4:23. Then his two per
formances last week.
Has Bob Simon lost the touch? Are we doomed to take a third or worse !
in this crucial event in the Cal meet? We think not. Night relays are
cold, windy affairs where everything is for the spectator and nothing for
the athlete. In the Fresno fracas, it was again a case of Stanford vs. SC,
the team gave their all. Simon was well in front for the place'money in the
medley and got the baton some 50 yards behind the leader. There was no
need to hurry. In the Coliseum Relays the field was too good. In Modesto
the prevalent spirit was that with only half a team (the other half of the
t< ;itn, namely Bob Mathias, was in the Islands competing in the
Rainbow Relays) what was the use in trying. We weren't going to scare
anyone. Keith Brownsberger, Jerry Wood, and Chuck Renlro stayed home
and studied.
As track coach Jack Weiershauscr said, '"I don't like night track meets
and I believe (he feeling is passed <111 from the coaching staff to the
team. We're not going to make the boys get keyed up over something that
wo don't believe in." Bob Simon agreed in point, but also felt that when- j
eve r an Indian team has a chance to make a dent in a Trojan scoring
column, you can he sure that they're all trying. Thus the Stanford's didn't
look 100 red hot last week—wait 'till next week. lads.

Sportsman of liie Week

The sportsmanship (extremely close relationship to lifemanship) award
of the week goes to swimmer John Weisor. Weiser. a lite man in and out
of the pool, has a pet expression that he uses when engaged in games of
mental and physical skill (i.e. pool, bridge, et al). When it is obvious that
he is going to win he exclaims, "And ah ha, the game is mine." In a recent
race, he found himself approximately 40 yards in the lead in the 200-yard
backstroke. As he made his last turn, he stopped dead in the water, turned
to the rooting section full of his fraternity brothers and, with a wave of his
M'm, exclaimed, "And ah ha. the race is mine." He continued on to victory.
