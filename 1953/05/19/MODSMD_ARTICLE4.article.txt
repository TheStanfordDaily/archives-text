# Lone Woman Rule Changed
## 
### 
Stanford women last night gave
their stamp of approval to the new
"standard of conduct" to replace the
former "lone woman rule."
The vote, taken last night in
house meetings, was 1,17!) in favor
of the change, 59 opposed. .
These totals do not include bal
lots of approximately fiO off-campus
women who will have a chance to
vote on the issue Thursday. The
margin of victory is so great, how
ever, that HO votes will not swing
the results.
The new standard goes into effect
today. It reads:
"Each Stanford woman is ex
pected to assume individual re
sponsibility to uphold and to help
maintain hoth within and without
the University the high standards
<>112 conduct which reflect favor- !
ably upon her, as a Stanford
woman, and upon the UniveKity.
These standards arc particularly
applicable to a woman's conduct
in a man's residence.
"Within these standards, a
woman may enter the downstairs
social area of a man's residence. (
The act of entering is in itself
neither acceptable nor unacccpt
table; it becomes unacceptable
when a woman's conduct is incon- j
sistent with the Fundamental
Standard."
The special AWS committee which !
recommended the change intended
the new standard to put added re
sponsibility on the girl's discretion. ■
The report emphasized thai from !
now on a girl will be expected to i
stop before entering a man's resi
dence and think about how her at-. L
lion.s will reflect on herself and the
University—instead of just follow- I
illy a rule.
Last night's approval of the
change climaxed more than three
years of work, begun in 1950 by
the 112 undamental Standard Com
mittee. A special AWS committee
was formed last spring and their
recommendation was approved by
the administration and ASSU Kx
enni before being put to a vote of
the women students.
A special orientation program is
planned to acquaint the women with
the ideas behind the standard and
to stimulate discussion on the kind
of conduct considered appropriate
for a Stanford woman.
