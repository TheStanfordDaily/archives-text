# 40-YEAR PROJECT
## Cubberley---Gift of Determined Man 
### LAURIE HALE 
Across from Engineering Corner on the Stanford campus stands
a familial building, a gift to Stanford from a couple who had only
35 cents between them on the day they were married.
The building is Cubberley Hall, and the couple Dr. and Mrs.
Elwood Patterson Cubberley. ♦

Dr. Cubberley joined the Stan
ford faculty in 18!)8. When he first
suggested the idea of a Department
of Education in that year, he was
ridiculed by members of the other
academic departments.
"What indeed was there to ed
ucation? A teacher either knew
his subject and was a good teach
er, or he did not know it and was
not ;« good teacher." was the gen
eral attitude.
But this attitude didn't discour
age Dr. Cubberley. For 20 years he
pressed his point and finally, in 1!)17.
University officials assented to the
idea of having a School of Educa
tion. Dr. Cubberley wa,s made dean
of the school. The four-quarter plan
still in use today was introduced in
that same year.
Almost immediately after his pro
motion, Dean Cubberley asked for
permission to begin plans for an
Education Building. His request
was granted, and in 192!) he wrote
in his calendar book: "Began work
on education building plans. Tried
library in the center. Abandoned
central library plan. Began on new
plan with library on second floor.
Found this plan to be workable."
During his administration at
Stanford. Dean Cubberley con
tinued his building plans. After
his retirement in 1 !)*>.*» at age 65,
lie began final plans, which were
finished in llt.'lX. No detail of the
planning escaped him. No deci
sions or revisions were made
without his personal approval.

When the architect changed one
I plan because lie thought it intcr-
I fried with the architectural beauty
| of the building, Dr. Cubberley had
the plans changed back, saying that
i the important thing was not how
the building looked, but what went
on inside of it.
Construction of the building be
! gan in Mftrch. 1!)37. In that year,
Dr. Cubberley was li!t years of age,
and his health was so poor that he
had to be carried upstairs.
The library was Dr. C'ubberley's
favorite interest, and he referred
to it as his playhouse." lie spent
hours each day setting up a new
card catalog system, and trans
ferred all the books in the main
library belonging to the School of
Education to the Cubberley Li
brary. This task took him two
and one-half years.
i Early in Dr. Cubberley's Stanford
career some of his students nick
named him "Dad," and the name
stuck. He was offered positions at
other colleges, many of them better
than the one he held at Stanford.
He always refused, saying, "Come
tometime and sec the house I have
built on the hillside, and you will
understand why I cannot consider
an invitation lo go anywhere else."


HE GAVE LfS CUBBERLEY—Dr. Elwood Patterson Cubberley,
the first dean of the Stanford School of Education, worked 40
years to found a School of Education at Stanford and to raise
money for a building for his school.
