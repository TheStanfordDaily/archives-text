# RIDGWAY SAYS:
## U.S. Cannot 'Go It Alone' 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 19 (UP)
-Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway
testified today the United States
would "invite inevitable national
disaster" if it broke up the free
world defense network to follow
a "go it alone" policy.
The North Atlantic Treaty com
mander appeared before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee to
support the administration's request
for $5,900,000,000 in foreign aid
funds for the coming fiscal year.
He told the Senators, as lie had
told the House Foreign Relations
Committee Monday, thai Allied
forces in Europe presently are "in
adequate" to meet the Soviet threat.
Ridgway, who will heroine
Army Chief of StalT in August,
was then questioned about the
recent U.S.-British dispute over
Korea, particularly the statements
that this country should "go it
alone" if Britain doesn't want to
follow U.S. policy.
The general, who formerly com
manded United Nations troops in
Korea, replied:
"Adoption of this concept would
be to invite inevitable national dis
aster."
The "go it alone" expression first
cropped up in Congressional hear
ings over the recall of Gen. Douglas
McArthur as Far Eastern command
er. It was used again recently by
Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy (R., Wis.)
in a Senate speech denouncing Brit
ish proposals for Korea.
Ridgway, under questioning by
Sen. William J. Fulbright. (D., Ark.),
said, "It. is absolutely essential t.o
our security that, we have allies."
At this point, Sen. William F.
Knowland (It.. Cal.), another re
cent critic of Britain, broke in to
ask if it is "not just as important
that they support lis as that wc
support them."
"Absolutely, yes sir," Ridgway
answered.
He said later there is "no ques
tion but that the Communists in
Europe have seized upon the
"growing exasperation" among the
Allies "to increase the influence of
decisive factors."
Ridgway also said the Russian
peace offensive has had "important
effects" on public opinion in Europe
and created "adverse reaction" to
the Western defense program.
He was the first high U.S. official
to appraise Soviet peace moves in
this manner although many have
warned that it, might happen.
