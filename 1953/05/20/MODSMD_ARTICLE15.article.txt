Dramatic cases of delayed speech,
stuttering, juvenile voice and
speech defects caused by cerebral
palsy, cancer of the larynx, and
hearing problems were illustrated
with records and discussed by Dr.
Virgil Anderson, head of Stanford's
Speech and Hearing Clinic, in Inst
night's Tuesday Evening Scries lec
ture.
Dr. Anderson emphasized that
eases of defective speech and hear
ing are far more complicated than
most people realize. "They consti
tute the largest group of handicap
ped children that we have," lie as
serted. One per cent of the popu
lation stutters, and four to five per
cent, of the school population have
hearing problems, he said.
Esophageal speech was de
scribed by Dr. Anderson as a rc
crnl solution to the total loss of
normal speech due to removal of
a cancerous larynx. A small hole
is made through the wall of the
throat for breathing purposes, and
the person learns to talk by swal
lowing air and bringing it back
up in the form of speech.
"Less hearing is required to un
derstand speech than is required to
produce speech," stated Dr. Ander
son in describing the difficulties of
rehabilitating persons whose speech
difficulties are caused by defective
hearing . He continued, "The deaf
and dumb person can't, talk merely
because he can't hear himself talk."
Dr. Anderson defined defective
speech as deviations from the
norm that call attention to them
selves and interfere with commu
nication. Only the most serious
of these cases arc able to get help
at present, as existing facilities are
still inadequate to the need.
