# PLAIN CRITICIZED
## U.N. Delays Truce Talks 
### 
TOKYO, Wednesday, May 20
!UP)â€”Authoritative sources said
today that last-minute British ob- -
jections to an Allied compromise
plan for breaking the Korean
I truce deadlock might have de
layed its presentation to the
Communists.
Renewal of the armistice talks af
ter a three-day recess had been set
for today. But the Allies suddenly
j extended the recess by five days to
next Monday.
The extension was announced an
hour before Lt. Gen. William K.
Harrison was to have left Tokyo for
j Korea with the compromise propo
sal worked out in consultations with
Gen. Mark W, Clark and with i
| Washington.
High sources believed that Brit
ain, and possibly France and Can
ada as well, had made objections,
I either to contents of the revamped
proposal or to the attitude Harri
son's team would take in present
ing it.
Prime Minister Winston Churchill
had given qualified endorsement, to
an earlier eight - point Communist
truce plan. Thn Allies rejected it.
They presented a counter-proposal
which the Reds promptly turned
down.
Responsible quarters here said
it seemed rcTtain that the United
States would not go ahead with
out some assurances from other
Allies, notably Britain, of full
support for the revised plan.
Clark's headquarters had the fol
lowing brief statement on the ex
tension of the recess:
"The United Nations command
desires more time to review past
efforts to settle the prisoner of war
questions and to consider carefully
j the present positions of both sides
with regard to this important issue."
