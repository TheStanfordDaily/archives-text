# An Activity? Think It Over First
## 
### 
It looks like spring again. For already Stan
ford's clubs, committees, and boards are hold
ing tryouts in the annual attempt to recruit new
members and officers.
A word to prospective joiners: Think it over
first.
The tact that some people didn't think first,
explains the inefficiency and vague purposes
of some campus organizations in existence to
day.
"Thinking first" means considering:
1. Is this organization doing anything? If so,
what, and do I agree with its goals?
2. Can this organization offer me anything?
Do 1 want to learn to paint a poster, dim foot
lights, conduct personnel relations, or wouJd I

be putting my time to better use in the Library?
3. Can I give anything to this organiza
lion? Do I have the time to do the job well
without ignoring my studies, or v/i 11 I end up
slipping by with a half way ellort?
4. Am I really interested in the work in
volved or am I mainly concerned with adding
another item to my list of accomplishments?
Jf you can go down this lis! and answer "yes"
to each question, why not turn out for inter
views?
Otherwise, stick to pursuing the lole of a stu
dent that's a big enough job in itself and
here's-to a more meaningful activities program
at Stanford.
