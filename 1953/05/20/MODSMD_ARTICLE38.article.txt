## 
### 
II alumni reaction can be used
as a criterion, the Stanford Sum
mer Camp is going to be a success.
All of the family accommodations
with baths for July and August
were sold out by April 1.
In a little over a month from the
time alumni first received details of
camp arrangements, more than 1,000
reservations had been received.
Except for a few singles without
baths, all reservations for the mid
summer sessions are filled, and
names are now being put on wait
ing lists for the period starting July
11 and ending Aug. 29.
The early and late, months- June
and September till have a few
vacancies, but they are rapidly be
ing filled.
