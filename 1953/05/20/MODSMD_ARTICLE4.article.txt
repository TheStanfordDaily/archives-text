# ROW BURGLARIES
## 'Looter' Is Suspected 
### 
Chief Gordon Davis has warned
all campus fraternity houses to he
on the lookout for a man he believes
might be the burglar who has oper
ated in the row area in recent
months.
A description of the man was for
warded to Davis by Berkeley police
after a member of a University of
California fraternity house spotted
the man just before a recent morning
burglary at the house.
The man was described as a
white American, about 40 years
old, live feet nine or ten inches
tall, and of a stocky build, lie was
of fair complexion, with a round
face and large nose. At the time
of the Cal burglary, he was wear
ing a tight-fitting brown pin-stripe
suit.
Davis, working with Berkeley po
lice, has said thai there is a "strong
chance" that recent burglaries at
Cal fraternity houses and the row
burglaries at Stanford have been
committed by the same man.
Both Davis and Berkeley police
have cited the similarities in the
circumstances of burglaries at the
two campusces. Davis has added
that when the row burglaries stop
at Stanford, the Cal campus is
usually hit by a string of thefts
at fraternity houses.
"It looks like the same man is
working at both schools," Davis
said.
During the past school year, al
most a dozen fraternity houses have
lost cameras, watches, clothing, and
hundreds of dollars in the burglar
ies. The houses have usually been
looted in early morning hours while
residents were sleeping.
