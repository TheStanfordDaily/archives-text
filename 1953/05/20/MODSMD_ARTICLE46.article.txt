## BEARING DOWN 
### 
Joe Chez, former Stanford pitcher i
who hurled for the Oakland Oaks
(his spring and then was optioned J
to Beaumont of the Texas League j
has retired for the year, his brother [
Fred reported the other day.
Joe, who had an 0-3 record in
(he Coast League and then no
decisions for Beaumont in four
innings of pitching, has decided to
rest up until he enters the Marine
Corps in July, Fred said.
Joe had several knots in his arm
and the Beaumont trainer said it
was a wonder that he could throw
at all.
The popular Chez, who won 31
games while losing but four in his
career on the Farm, drew his out
right release from both Oakland and
Beaumont and he hopes to return
to pro ball after his two-year tour
of duty. Last year he signed with
the Detroit Tigers for a bonus and
played with Williamsport in v the
Eastern League.
Three other former Indian dia- !
mond stars are still performing in
the PCI/. Kog OsenhaUgh and Dave
Dahle, both pitchers, and with Sac- !
ranieiHo and San Diego, respec- |
lively, while Dave Melton was 1
doing some shortstopping for the j
San Francisco Seals until a sore
arm caught up with him.

younger brother of Jim, recently re
ceived an All-America rating by the
lnterscholastic Swimming Coaches
Association for the second straight
year. Bob, who performs for Sequoia
High in Kedwood City, also set two
new Peninsula Athletic League rec- I
ord.s in the finals held last week.
Bob splashed to a new individual J
150-yard medley record ol 1:40.2 and
also shattered the 100-yard back- j
stroke mark (which he had ;;et but i

i a week earlier) in 1:03 ,2.
Jack Scramaglia, younger broth
er of Rich, is also one of the top
! high school haschallers in the San
Francisco area. Jack, who re
sembles his brother physically, led
St. Ignatius High to second place
i in the city league, and was also
second in the league In runs
scored. He was a standout fielder,
and several big league scouts are
reportedly very interested in him
One of the topics that has kept
major league circles buzzing this
spring is what was the longest hit
ball of all time? Mickey Mantle's
565-foot diive at Washington and
Joe Ad cock's smash ( into the center
field bleachers at the Polo Grounds
in New York have helped to renew
this old controversy.

Last week's issue of the Sport
ing News, the baseball bible, dis

1 have topped them all. A 618-foot
hit by Ray Carlyle of the Oakland
Oaks oil of Ernie Ncvjers, Stan
ford's all-time Ail-American foot
i ball star.
Carlyle hit this mighty blow July
4, 192!) when Nevers, who also
pitched for the St. Louis Browns,
was toiling on the hill for the old
San Francisco Missions.
This is the way Carlyle recounts
the blast:
'it went over the center field
fence, and at, Oakland the cluh
l house is in center field, like the
| Polo Grounds,
"Well, the ball went over the
! fence at the deepest part, crossed
the street and hit on lop of a house
j mi the other side. They went out
| and measured it the next morn
ing. and they told me it was (lIS
feet."

younger brother of Jim, recently re

Association for the second straight
year. Bob, who performs for Sequoia
High in Kedwood City, also set two
new Peninsula Athletic League rec- I
ord.s in the finals held last week.
Bob splashed to a new individual J
150-yard medley record ol 1:40.2 and
also shattered the 100-yard back- j
stroke mark (which he had ;;et but i

i a week earlier) in 1:03 ,2.
Jack Scramaglia, younger broth
er of Rich, is also one of the top
! high school haschallers in the San
Francisco area. Jack, who re
sembles his brother physically, led
St. Ignatius High to second place
i in the city league, and was also
second in the league In runs
scored. He was a standout fielder,
and several big league scouts are
reportedly very interested in him
One of the topics that has kept
major league circles buzzing this
spring is what was the longest hit
ball of all time? Mickey Mantle's
565-foot diive at Washington and
Joe Ad cock's smash ( into the center
field bleachers at the Polo Grounds
in New York have helped to renew
this old controversy.

hit by Ray Carlyle of the Oakland
Oaks oil of Ernie Ncvjers, Stan
ford's all-time Ail-American foot
i ball star.
Carlyle hit this mighty blow July
4, 192!) when Nevers, who also
pitched for the St. Louis Browns,
was toiling on the hill for the old
San Francisco Missions.
This is the way Carlyle recounts
the blast:
'it went over the center field
fence, and at, Oakland the cluh
l house is in center field, like the
| Polo Grounds,
"Well, the ball went over the
! fence at the deepest part, crossed
the street and hit on lop of a house

ing. and they told me it was (lIS
feet."

Jack Scramaglia, younger broth
er of Rich, is also one of the top
! high school haschallers in the San
Francisco area. Jack, who re
sembles his brother physically, led
St. Ignatius High to second place
i in the city league, and was also
second in the league In runs
scored. He was a standout fielder,
and several big league scouts are
reportedly very interested in him
One of the topics that has kept
major league circles buzzing this
spring is what was the longest hit
ball of all time? Mickey Mantle's
565-foot diive at Washington and
Joe Ad cock's smash ( into the center
field bleachers at the Polo Grounds
in New York have helped to renew
this old controversy.
* *1* *
One authority has it that Babe
Ruth once hit a ball <>110 feet and
another 580 feet, while there is
j plenty of support for unmeasured
! blasts by Jimmie Foxx. Joe Jack
son, and Roger Connor.
Last week's issue of the Sport
ing News, the baseball bible, dis
| closes the story of a clout that may
1 have topped them all. A 618-foot
hit by Ray Carlyle of the Oakland
Oaks oil of Ernie Ncvjers, Stan
ford's all-time Ail-American foot
i ball star.
Carlyle hit this mighty blow July
4, 192!) when Nevers, who also
pitched for the St. Louis Browns,
was toiling on the hill for the old
San Francisco Missions.
This is the way Carlyle recounts
the blast:
'it went over the center field
fence, and at, Oakland the cluh
l house is in center field, like the
| Polo Grounds,
"Well, the ball went over the
! fence at the deepest part, crossed
the street and hit on lop of a house
j mi the other side. They went out
| and measured it the next morn
ing. and they told me it was (lIS
feet."
