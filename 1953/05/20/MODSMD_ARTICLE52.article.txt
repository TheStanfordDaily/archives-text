# PRO AND CAHN

Bob Baldocchi. Stanford's champion 178-pound boxer will not turn pro
fessional.
When I asked him the other afternoon what his plans were. Bob replied
that professional boxing was out.
"When I graduate this June 1 shall go to business school, if I get in, and
if I don't get drafted. Boxing has never been anything more to me than a
Fine form of relaxation.
"If I do get in graduate school I hope to help Ray Lunny coach a bit next
year.
"Lunny is one of the finest coaches in the country. If lie had the ma
terial that some of these schools have, Stanford would have no trouble
whipping everyone."
Baldocchi had just returned from winning the 178-pound Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate title. Earlier this year he copped the Northern California
crown for the same division. Bob, when 1 last saw him, out at sunken
diamond watching a ball game, was still nursing a badly bruised lip.
But Bob doesn't show the usual marks of the fighting trade. No flattened
nose or cauliflower ears.
In fact, he's the first to admit that boxing is just about the least dangerous
of all college sports.
"Boxing is very well supervised. We wear headgears and there is
very little chance for injury. Even pro boxing is so well supervised that
a hoy doesn' often get hurt. Following a knockout, the victim is given
a mandatory ryst of about two weeks. This comes after x-rays regard
less whether the pictures show any injury or not. This isn't true in
football where a player can be knocked goofy in one quarter and be
right hack in the game the next."
Bob, whose home i>j in Lodi. has one of the finest collegiate records
around this area.
When he came to Stanford four years ago, Bob weighed in at 155 and
fought at that weight, taking the intramural championship. There was
no frosh competition.
As a sophomore and junior Bob won eight and lost three. His three
losses were in his sophomore season and lie had five wins in a row in his
junior year but a damaged thumb kept him from further tournament
competition.
And in the season just completed he piled up eight wins and one loss.
As the 21-year-old battler puts it."I have been 'l'KOd only twice since
i first took up boxing at the age of 13. I boxed four years at Lodi High
which is one of the few high schools which have boxing teams.
You can't take a bad beating in amateur boxing because on the school
level they stop the fight as soon as one man is being badly outclassed, which
probably accounts for my two TKOs being just that and not KOs."
I asked Bob how he has benefited from boxing.
"Primarily boxing has made me a better rounded individual and (bat
I am grateful for. You can gain recognition by boxing, though that
is not a primary goal. Most of all. boxing is tun '
I have shared with many the viewthat boxers are often a stereotype,
men pretty rough and quicker with their hands than their heads. But
Robert corrects me, or at least does so on the college level.
"The boy that goes out for college boxing is just like anyone else. He is
looking for athletic competition. It is an excellent opportunity for the
smaller man who can compete with men in his own weight size and is
not battering an awesome football line or attempting to play basketball with
menjjut of his height range.
"The basic requisite for a boxer is to have a burning desire to win. II
he really wants to win a fellow can do it, even with little ability, because
Lunny can teach a man an awful lot. More men should actually try col
lege boxing."
But the fellow who has made such a niche for Stanford and himself willi
his boxing finesse is about,to hang up the gloves.
"I am not as good as Michigan State's Chuck Davey. I know when to
stop."
