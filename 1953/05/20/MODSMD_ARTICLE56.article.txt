# Speech Clinic: From One Room to Research
## 
### RUTH WOLPE 
Tommy, who had developed breathing and feeding difficulty
soon after birth, was classified as spastic and uneducable, with
completely unintelligible speech. His mother expected to place
him in some state institution.
A home-teacher, noticing the boy's interest in learning to read,

I sent him to the Stanford Speech and*
j Hearing Clinic. Various clinical cx-
I crcises relaxed his body and speech
j organs. Controlled breathing was
; taught with pinwheel and soapbub
blc "games," and muscular co-ordi
nation by swallowing and chewing
exercises. Sound by sound, he
learned to speak.
This is an example of the work
done by the Clinic, which began
in a very modest way in the au
tumn of 1932 when Dr. Virgil A.
Anderson, of Stanford's Speech
and Drama Department, started
the clinic primarily for Stanford
students who had speech prob
lems.
The clinic was an extra-curricular
activity in addition to Dr. Ander
son's teaching load. He had no
equipment and only one small room
I in which he did all the work. Yet

The Stanford Speech and Hear
ing Clinic has received a $2,1500
grant from the United Cerebral
Palsy Association of Peninsula
Cities, Inc., to establish an inten
sive program of speech therapy
for cerebral palsied children in
this part of the Bay Area, it was
announced yesterday.

during that year, for 30 minutes
once each week, 28 students re
ceived treatment for their speech
deficiencies.
In the spring of 1933, two students
enrofled lor independent study in
speech correction; in 1935 the first
formal courses in voice science were
offered.
At present the Speech and
Hearing Clinic is housed in lim
ited but pleasant quarters on the

tliiril Honor of the Knoll. Any ma
terial expamron of the Clinic's !
activities will require larger quar
ters and a certain amount of ad
ditional equipment.
The Clinic operates 'with three I
main purposes in mind:
1. To provide a greater number of
competent teachers in speech and j
hearing therapy.
2. To provide therapeutic treat
ment for more patients with dis
orders of speech and hearing.
3. To improve existing techniques
in speech and hearing therapy by |
clinical studies and research, and to
make these techniques generally
available.
Stanford now provides the only
year-round out-patient clinical
services available on the West
Coast between the University of
Oregon to the north and the Uni
versity of Southern California to 1
the south. Some teaching courses
and sporadic clinical services arc
available at other institutions.
"Any student who has any speech
problem should contact the Clinic,
for its first responsibility is to Stan
ford'students," emphasizes Dr. An
derson.
At the beginning of the fall quar
ter the Clinic began a special pro
gram of speech therapy for adult j
stutterers. The training consists of j
one group meeting each week sup
plemented by individual therapy
where needed or desired by the in
dividual.
In addition to Dr. Anderson, who
is the Clinic director, Dr. Hayes A.
Newby, a specialist in audiology,
serves as assistant director and pro
vides courses and clinical training J
in the field of hearing and deaf- j
ness:
This includes instruction in the j
teaching of lip-reading and other
phases of work with the deaf and j
hard of hearing.
In 1950-51 the Clinic treated 12(1 \
individuals for periods varying
from three months to a year.
Since 11K52, a total of 1,.'!9!J speech
defective individuals have re
ceived aid, some for periods as
long as two years. Each clinical
case has been worked with sepa
rately, usually in 30-minutc pe
riods twice a week.
For every student graduated as a
speech and hearing specialist, there
arc requests for about five to fill
existing available positions; the j
number of these positions is in- j
creasing as the great importance j

and value of this work becomes
more generally understood.
On the clinical side, the pres
sure for admissions is tragic; only
the most urgent eases can be ac
cepted. A high school counselor

brings in a boy, 13, whose speech
is very hard to understand and
who lias distressing facial con
tortions. The counselor asks for
an hour a day. The very most
that can be squeezed in is half

an hour twice a week.
What the Clinic now has is vir
tually a pilot plant that has demon
stratcd and developed effective
techniques for treating speech de
fectives and for educating teachers

Tommy, who had developed breathing and feeding difficulty

him in some state institution.
A home-teacher, noticing the boy's interest in learning to read,

learned to speak.

students who had speech prob
