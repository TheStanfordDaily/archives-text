# CAMPUS OPINION
## For More Men Like McCarthy 
### 
To the Editor:
A: a Stanford senior who will have his last say about
Stanford politics and policies, I would most like to
an: wer blatantly Mr. Hadley Koff
Monseigneur Joseph McCarthy has been one of the
so-called sore spots ol American politics, diplomacy,
imperialism, etc., ad infinitum, ail nauseum. Most
of these attacks have been by Democrats and Commu
nists (not to mention a few Republicans). One of my
professors here at the University lias gone as far as
calling him a Caudillo! (Caudillo is the South Ameri
can and Spanish term for petty dictator!)
I consider it a grave misfortune for the United States
not to have more McCarthys! It is unfortunate that
there are not more men in Washington who by the
strength of their convictions are unafraid to stand up
in front of us and declare what they believe to be true,
right, and just.
McCarthy is just such a man who, not being one of
the elected mush-legged fog horns (lo wit Moi'se)
that soften their policies come election time, is un
afraid to say what he thinks is true from (sometimes
limited, for what can you do when you can't prove a
peison something and you know he is?) data and sta
tistics. And strange though it may seem in relation

to Kofi's debatable logic (be lie one of the elite holding
a paper declaring himself to be an educator) ami ap
peal for the defeat of Sen. McCarthy in the next elec
tions, he was reelected (by his un-Koff educated con
stituents perhaps!)
II the only appeal that can be made to a man of
McCarthy's ilk is one hard and political, why did the
President during his first month in office (because Mc-
Carthy said nothing about our propaganda Voice of
America) stale our psychological warfare against the
"enemy would be strengthened? Maybe perhaps he
saw (after McCarthy's screaming) that the situation
was deplorable.
If lie is doing our political affairs with Kngland
wrong by a verbal exchange with Attlee (who was
ousted, remember?) what is England doing to us and
the U.N. with her roaring at our blockade of Red
China?
Finally, since when is it the prime purpose of edu
cators (who supposedly believe in academic freedom,
see editorial section Daily, May 18) lo import upon
students their ideas and beliefs? I thought it was the
prime purpose of education to teach the students
some facts and then permit the students to arrive at
their own conclusions and ideas!
