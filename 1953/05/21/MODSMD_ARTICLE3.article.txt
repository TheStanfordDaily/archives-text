## Thousands Watch Firemen Battle Spreading Flames

ll,y lIADLKY KOI I
The rambling wood-frame stable
and water tower on the Sharon Es- j
tatc ofT Sand Hill Road, long a
landmark in the area, mysteriously
caught fire and burned to the
ground last night.
The fire, which lighted the Penin
sula like a Roman candle and at
tracted spectators from a radius of
12 miles, was difficult to quell be- j
cause of a stiff wind.
The structure, abandoned since |
1038, was a part of a group of |
stables and barns located on top of
a knoll overlooking the Bay Area
about five miles from the campus.
One of the smaller barns was also
destroyed in the spectacular blaze
and a third building was severely
damaged.
These out-buildings were set afire
by waves of sparks that swirled
from the blazing stable.
The fire was reported about !) p.tn.
by an unidentified man who walked :
into the Stanford fire department.
Five fire departments, including
the Stanford unit, responded to the

j alarm and wore still combating the j
stubborn flames at midnight.
Firemen wcjrc handicapped in I
their efforts by' a stiff wind that \
spewed sparks over a wide area and |
by a snarl of traffic leading to the j
buildings.
San Mateo County sheriff's dep-! j
utics estimated that more than 1,000 i
j cars swarmed to the scene.
Fire Chief John Marston of Stan- ;
j ford estimated the wind on the |
knoll at 3. r ) miles an hour. The wind j
was so hard, he said, that it blew 1
water back in the faces of the fire- I
men when they tried to direct hoses I
at the fire.
I
Tentative investigations indicated
that the fire began on the second
floor of the abandoned stable. Cause
of the blaze is not. known.
* • ' c
Firemen made little attempt, to I
save the giant stable. Flames had
already climbed to the peak of its '
t 75-loot water tower when the first
trucks arrived. Climax of the wild
blaze came when the tower col- 5
lapsed with a thunderclap and an I
| explosion of flames. c
However, Stanford firemen did j
I try to save the small barn immedi-
ately behind the stable but were ,

juitc sure that I will derive a groat,
ioal of benefit from the experience,
md I hope that the students will
dso benefit."

Units from Menlo Park and Los
Altos and from the Woodside and
Belmont stations of the San Mateo
County fire department joined the
Stanford fire department.

Caretaker John Rathbun wa.s un
available for comment last night.

I "slowly unci in their own way," unci
thatithe U.S. would be morally un
justified in using economic coercion
; to speed the process.
One of his primary arguments
arose from a statement made l»y
Mi-Williams, the California rep
-1 resentative and one of the de
fenders «»l the affirmative. i\li-Wil
liams had said thai "tin- war is
lost in Indo-China."
; Jucobson's rebuttal ended with a
J denial that the French war against
Viet-Minh (roops in Indo-China was
lost.
"If this resolution is adopted, then
the war will be lost," he asserted.
