## 
### DON STEPHENS 
The Stanford varsity swimming squad will enplane to Los An
geles today to compete in the Pacific Coast Conference champion
ship meet—a meet that finds the Indians an overwhelming favor
ite to notch their third straight PCC crown.
Stanford is favored to win 12 out of 14 events in winning their

14th PCC crown in 24 years. The
Cards have placed second six times.
(JSC's third-place Olympic diver,
John McCormack, should notch a
dual win in the low and high board
diving events.
With the first event, the 1,500 me
ters, slated for 4 p.m. in the USC

pool, the entourage of 15 swimmers,
two managers, and the coach will
leave the Sati Mateo airport at 11
.i.iii.
And, in this initial event, Stan
lord'.s Dan Osborne is favored to
walk oil with the winner's laurels;
however, USC's Olympic star, Alan
Gilchrist, is expected to push the
Card sophomore to his utmo t per
formance. Osborne will be out to
retain last year's PCC crown.
AI Lauderback, Cal, who holds
the PCC record established in 195J,
should rate as the dark-horse; how
ever, so far this season he has had
trouble in returning to his sopho
more peak.
A draftee from the Card water

polo team, Bill Mclvor, who has just
started competitive swimming, could
pull an upset and land in third
place. He has the physical equip
| ment and the desire.
Osborne is also favored to win
I his other specialties, the 220- and
440-yard freestyle, while Gilchrist
has an outside cha/ice of an upset
in both events with his best per
formance. USC's Jerry McNamee is
expected to take third in the 220
and Lauderback in the 440.
Stanford may have two triple
winners if Larry Heim can stave oil
! McNamee's threat in the 150-yard
individual medley. Heim has posted
I a .season's be t of 1:33.7 while Me-
Nrmes is do. e behind with a 1:34.1
effort. But in the 100- and 200-yard
backstroke it should be all Heim—
having a clear-cut three- and a six
econ I edge re peclively in both
events. However, Stanford's John
'Wei-er has steadily improved with
each outing and may possibly puii
an upset victory.
Jim Gaughran is favored to cap
lure the 50- and 100-yard freestyle
George Mowat, Stanford sophomore,
should notch a second in the sprint,
! whfle McNamee has a chance to
i place in the 100. John Morris is
j favored to repeat for third place in
j both events.
The 100 and 200 breaststroke
i events find the Indians' Ashley
Jones in the driver's seat, but team
i mate Bill Clemans has an outside
j chance to rack up a win.
Stanford's four - man relay team
of Lee Gunnerson, Mowat, Jim Lee,
| and Morris should win the 400-yard
relay, while John Weiser, Jones,
| and Jim Koll will go for the Cards
i in the 300-yard medley relay.
