Howie Hertz flipped the shotput 54 ft. 9 I A in. Friday night in
the Los Angeles Coliseum Relays, and it landed him the Daily's
Athlete of the Week award.
Massive, muscular Hertz—a six-foot three-inch, 250-pound speci
man—established his own personal record with his toss in the

Coliseum event won by world rec
ord holder Parry O'Brien and ele
vated himself to fourth place in the
all-time list of Stanford shotputters.
Both Hertz and Coach Jack Weier
shauser expect even better perform
ances before the season closes. Said
Weiershauser, "Howie will certainly
continue to improve and should
break 55 feet very soon."
Hertz also mentioned the 55-foot
goal. "I've been pointing for this
season since I transferred to Stan
ford from Mt. San Antonio College.
And the PCC and National meets in
the next two months are the only
opportunities I'll have to improve
my record. Next season I won't be
eligible for AAU competition be
cause I'm going to be an assistant
coach at the University of Kansas."
Speaking of his lengthy toss of last
weekend, Hertz was all smiles. "That
one really felt good," he said. "The
perfect condition of the Coliseum
circle helped me a lot. So did the
presence of O'Brien. I always seem

to do better with that guy around.
My previous best, 54 ft. 1 1 s in., was
a second place to O'Brien."
O'Brien will be around again in
the PCC meet in the Stanford Sta
dium next week; Hertz hopes to up
his mark a little higher that day.
