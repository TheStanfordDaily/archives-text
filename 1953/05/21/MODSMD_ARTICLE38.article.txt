Educators are faced with ever
increasing demands for preparation
o! TV shows and student training in
television, according to Institute Di
rector Stanley T. Dormer.
The enormous number of new
television stations anticipated in
the next few years will magnify
these demands at least tenfold, he
added.
Enrollment in the full eight-week
Institute is limited to 75 students,
chosen on the basis of active inter
est and probable value of the train
ing to them. Two years of college,
or the equivalent, are required.
Set up in co-operation with the

course will last two weeks. The ed
ucators will take special work and
seminars in which they will study
in detail the multiple problems of
educational telecasting.
Closing date for applications is
June 14. Full details and applica
tion forms may be obtained from
Professor Stanley Donner, Speech
and Drama Department.
