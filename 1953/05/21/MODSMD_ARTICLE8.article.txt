## 
### 
"As far as I am concerned,
Stanford has won the right to
play in the PCC finals," Athletic
Director A 1 Masters said last
night when asked how the Stan
ford-USC tie for first in the CIBA
would affect the PCC north
south baseball playoffs.
"They can't challenge us for that
title," Masters continued.
"They could challenge us, hut that
would only he for the NCAA. The
school that wins the .series in the
PCC wins the right to play in the
playoff. Play in the CIBA does not
affect the PCC."
Willis (). Hunter, Southern Cal
ifornia's Director Athletics, was
unavailable for comment last
night, but there is a possibility that
the Trojans will ask to meet the
PCC winner (either Stanford,
Oregon, or Oregon State) in a
special playoff to represent Dis
trict Eight in the NCAA cham
pionships at Omaha nc\t month.
Decision on this playoff, which
might even include Fresno State
and Seattle, two leading West. Coast
independents, rests with Ihc NCAA
District selection committee
consisting of Clint Evans' of Califor
nia, Rod Dedeaux of USC, and
Ralph Coleman of Oregon State.
They have complete jurisdiction
without regard for conference rules.
