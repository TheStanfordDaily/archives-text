# Stanford, Cal Trackmen Clash in 58th ‘Big Meet’
## Card Finale Al Berkeley Is ‘Toss-up' 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
A lot of worried-looking men
'ire spending their working
hours out at Angell Field, and
this Saturday's 58th Big Meet at
Edwards Field, Berkeley, is the
focal point of their worries.
This year, the experts arc giving
tin- norl to Stanford by the slim
mest of margins, while the Stanford
coaching staff, for the first time this
year, have broken out the black
hands and are wearing the look of
doom.
Quotli Jack Wciei shauscr. Stan
ford head man, "If we score 5.i
points, we'll he doing well."
The reason for tiic depression
psychosis is the rapidly growing list
of Stanford injuries. Dave Fletcher,
the white hope in the half mile, has
a bad leg and can't even work out.
Maury Parsons has a bad leg which
could cost us points in the sprints.
Ditto for low hurdler Marty John
son, "the grand old man of the
Stanford track team."
Chuck Rcnfro, a surc-in for at
least a second in the discus, is car
rying around a sore wrist. All three
Stanford broad jumpers, Pete Mc-
Kay, Loren Sorensen, and Jim See
bold, still have carry-overs from
early-season ills.
In the javelin, Stanford's un
beaten (in college competition)
trio, Leo Long, Bob Kimball, and
Chuck Harlow, all with bests over
20(1 feet, put their mark on the
block and probably will see it fall.
The nemesis to their records will
be Sam Adams, "best weight man
for his size in Cal history," ac
cording to Cal press releases.
Adams could just be the man to
turn the tide in favor of Br'cr Bear.
Adams .set. the pace in the nation


BEARS BEWARE—Stanford's Bob Mathias displays the form in
the discus that Stanford fans hope will give him one of several
first places in tomorrow's meet at California. Farm hopes for a
victory hinge to a great extent on the performance of the decath
lon champion, for the meet is doped as a close one.
