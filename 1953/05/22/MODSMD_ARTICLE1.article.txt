# Stanford, Cal Trackmen Clash in 58th ‘Big Meet’
## Card Finale Al Berkeley Is ‘Toss-up' 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
A lot of worried-looking men
'ire spending their working
hours out at Angell Field, and
this Saturday's 58th Big Meet at
Edwards Field, Berkeley, is the
focal point of their worries.
This year, the experts arc giving
tin- norl to Stanford by the slim
mest of margins, while the Stanford
coaching staff, for the first time this
year, have broken out the black
hands and are wearing the look of
doom.
Quotli Jack Wciei shauscr. Stan
ford head man, "If we score 5.i
points, we'll he doing well."
The reason for tiic depression
psychosis is the rapidly growing list
of Stanford injuries. Dave Fletcher,
the white hope in the half mile, has
a bad leg and can't even work out.
Maury Parsons has a bad leg which
could cost us points in the sprints.
Ditto for low hurdler Marty John
son, "the grand old man of the
Stanford track team."
Chuck Rcnfro, a surc-in for at
least a second in the discus, is car
rying around a sore wrist. All three
Stanford broad jumpers, Pete Mc-
Kay, Loren Sorensen, and Jim See
bold, still have carry-overs from
early-season ills.
In the javelin, Stanford's un
beaten (in college competition)
trio, Leo Long, Bob Kimball, and
Chuck Harlow, all with bests over
20(1 feet, put their mark on the
block and probably will see it fall.
The nemesis to their records will
be Sam Adams, "best weight man
for his size in Cal history," ac
cording to Cal press releases.
Adams could just be the man to
turn the tide in favor of Br'cr Bear.

BEARS BEWARE—Stanford's Bob Mathias displays the form in
the discus that Stanford fans hope will give him one of several
first places in tomorrow's meet at California. Farm hopes for a
victory hinge to a great extent on the performance of the decath
lon champion, for the meet is doped as a close one.
with a heave over 2J3 feet earlier
in the season, bu: -.injuries kept him
from competing for the last few
weeks. Leo has consistently beaten
him each previous time they have
met, including last year's Big Meet,
h will be tight.
And if he should move up from
his figured third in the discus, the
meet could just move up with him.
Iron man for the Stanford team
will again he lloli Mathias. run
ning his last dual meet for the
Cardinals. The dope sheet has him
taking three firsts and a third
(second?), with the blue ribbons
coining in the two hurdles and (he
discus.
In the record deparment, Big Bob
stands a better than even chance of
breaking two Big Meet standards.
His own mark of 14.15 set last year
in the highs could fall without
strain, as could the old mark oi HJ4
feet 5'/k inches set by Stanford's
Pete Zagar back in 1939. Bob shares
the high stick marker with Card
Downing McKee, who ran his rec
ord setting race in 1919.
The opening race of the day could
be the deciding one lor either team.
Stanford's Bob Simon is favored oil
early-season efforts (4:13.9), but he
hasn't shown too much in bis last
four outings. If he is off his form,
Len Simpson with a season's best
4:17.1 could take first and a rnuch
needed five points.
The XSO looks like the strongest
event of the day, and it all goes
on the Cal ledger. Their team of
John Nelson, Jim Hutchinson, and
I'M llersh, all under 1:55.2. should
sweep with Fletcher only limping.
Hutchinson will probably be shift
ed to the quarter with the hope that
Krans Doleman with a 1:56.2 can
take show money.
All in all, it looks too close for
comfort, and could wind up a tie.
Off earlier season records, Stanford
has to play the favorite roll. Off
present condition, Cal looks awfully
good, even with the loss of Larry
Anderson, a 13-9 pole vaulter early
this week. The relay should de
cide it, and that'll be closer than
a stop watch's second. The only
thing we can say for sure is that it'll
be a ereat race.
