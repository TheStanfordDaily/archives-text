# House of Representatives
## 
### 
Excom came to grips with a proposal for a
student House of Representatives Wednesday
night, a proposal that can effect a radical re
vision of Stanford's student government.
The idea behind the proposal is to erect a
broader structural base for student legislation
"to give the ASSU back to the students," as
Student Manager Steve Horn remarked in
Wednesday's lively discussion.
The body would meet every two weeks to
consider any or all kinds of legislation with the
exception of budgetary matters, which would
still be under tl»e jurisdiction of Excom.
On paper the design for the new House of
Representatives is at least very handsome a-nd
probably quite sound.
A house of 87 or 88 members is called for,
giving proportional representation to on and
off campus groups.
Decisions of the House would be carried to
Excom by a Speaker, the Speaker, ejected from
the members of the House, would serve as an
ex-officio member of Excom. Excom would
fetain a veto power over decisions of the
House, but only if it acted within 30 days after
the House actions were taken.
The House would also be in an excellent
postion to advise various ASSU standing com
mittees, boards, and commissions. Here, the
House would be a much more widespread

"voice of the students" than Excom can pos
sibly be.
This year's Excom OK'd the idea or principle
of the;. House of Representatives Wednesday
night and passed the ball to next year's body
for fufther consideration.
We think the action was prudent, especially
since about half of the present Excom members
will still be members next fall to see that the
ball actually gets to the new Excom.
While the idea of a Hoijse of Representatives
is sound to our mind, it is also radical enough
to require a thorough and detailed develop
ment and a complete acceptance by the stu
dent body as a whole before it can become an
effective unit of student government.
Two phases in particular warrant further
consideration. One is the relationship between
the House and Excom and how the two of thern
will fit into the organizational pattern of the
ASSU.
The other is a means of ensuring a conscien
tious and able membership. There seems to be
enough difficulty in finding adequate repre
sentatives for the presently constituted Excom,
without seeking 08 from the living groups.
By working out these problems and bringing
the idea of a House of Representatives to re
ality, we believe that next year's Excom can
score a spectacular touchdown on ,i play
started Wednesday night.

ment and a complete acceptance by the stu
dent body as a whole before it can become an
effective unit of student government.
Two phases in particular warrant further
consideration. One is the relationship between
the House and Excom and how the two of thern
will fit into the organizational pattern of the
ASSU.
The other is a means of ensuring a conscien
tious and able membership. There seems to be
enough difficulty in finding adequate repre
sentatives for the presently constituted Excom,
without seeking 08 from the living groups.
By working out these problems and bringing
the idea of a House of Representatives to re
ality, we believe that next year's Excom can
score a spectacular touchdown on ,i play
started Wednesday night.
