## Farm Grad's Paper Banned 
### BOB REZAK 
A woman publisher, a former
night editor on the Stanford Daily,
who had her newspaper banned
from American troops in Frankfurt,
Germany, by the United States
Army, yesterday accused the Army
of violating the freedom of the
press and appealed to Vice-Presi
dent Nixon for support.
According to the Army the paper
was banned because its stories of
"sex and prostitution" had "raised a
.storm of protest."
Mrs, Marion von Itospach, 27
years old, who was the former
Marion Constance Morrow at the
lime she worked on the Daily at
Stanford in l!)1(J, said the Army's
European headquarters had or
dered her to stop printing and
distributing her "Overseas Week
ly" to the (il's because of its sto
ries about Christine Jorgensen,
Pat Ward, and others.
The Army, in a letter to Mrs. Von
Rospach, said the protest came
"from commanders in the field and
others concerned with the moral
welfare <>112 military and dependent
personnel."
Mrs. Von Hospach, who married
another former Stanford student,
Cecil von Rospach, said she had
never had "one single dime" of help
from the Army and had paid Stars
and Stripes, the unofficial Army
newspaper, $100,000 for the use of
its printing presses.
"Perhaps the Army is really ob
jecting to some other features of
our paper—such as columns by
Drew Pearson, Walter Winehell,
and Westbrook Pegler, which we
alone are offering American
troops," she was quoted as saying
in Frankfurt.
In San Francisco, Mrs. W. S. Mor
row, mother of Mrs. von Rospach,
■-■lid she believed her daughter would
fight the ban on the paper.
"I know she will give them a bad
time," Mrs. Morrow declared. "Shc'.s
a fighter."
