## Academic Freedom: 'Participation Open 
### 
To the Editor:
The ASSU Acadcmio Freedom Committee was cre
ated by the Executive Committee at a regular meeting
Wednesday, May 13, L9SH. The purpose of the Com
mittee as stated at that time is "to explore various
methods and approaches that might be used in pre
senting the problem and ramifications of the subject
of academic freedom to Stanford students and fac
ulty."
Participation in the Committee is open to all
students sincerely interested in carryihg on its basic
purposes. it should be clarified that this committee is
to serve as a research and policy forming group, and
that it is responsible to the Executive Committee for
its entire program.
Il is not the intention of this committee to direct
its efforts toward a documented protest against
United States Congressional investigations, it is,
rather, to center i(s Study around a comprehensive
analysis of academic freedom, related rights and
responsibilities, and effects of Congressional investi
gations on free inquiry and intellectual integrity.
The committee intends also to formulate the most
effective and constructive statement feasible to lie
submitted to the Executive Committee for possible
approval and promulgation on behalf of the As
sociated Students.
Because the committee is sponsored by the A.y.oei

a ted Students of Stanford University, the chairman
believes that an extensive variety of opinions and
viewpoints of Stanford students must In* considered
before final conclusions are reached. To aid the
realization of this aim, a program of discussions,
symposiums, and debates will be conducted over
the campus.
However, opinions are not enough. The commit
tee must also carry on extensive research to seek
facts on which to base the final recommendatims
to the Executive Committee. The President of the
University has shown his interest in the committee
by offering to work with the students, and by pro
viding an excellent collection of documents ni<i
clippings for evaluation. Research will not be
limited to this material, however. The chairman
stresses that careful study and del if eration are of
primary importance in the committee program.
The purposes of the commitU e catj be effectively
realized only if the members approach the problems
with critical minds, and a sincere desire to delve into
as many of the aspects of the problems as possible.
Preconceived conclusions are a hindrance to the ra
tional, clear thinking necessary to tacjjje such a com
plicated subject as academic freedom and its vari
ous related issues.
