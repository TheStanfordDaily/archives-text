Sell in;/ i.s a reverse action to buying. Yet, ii what
yijU are considering is selling us a career, then I>ny—
jug other people's buying -can have a thumping big
ellce! ori your progress.
io •X'll successfully, it is necessary first to sell your
self to a buyer- someone who will hire you and
iioxind answers to these six important questions will
help you to do ju.st that:
Why do I want to sell; what do I know abort sel-

ling; what kind of people do I
want to rail on; what do 112 want
to sell; where do I want to sell;
and what is my choice of com
panies?
Why Me in Selling?
Your desire to .sell should be
backed by a very definite liking
for people in general.
Anything that you've done per
sonally to build and expand your
relationships with people will ex-

■ ■■ m
plain your attraction to soiling.
Make your reach for a sales position reflect from
past experience how you already have employed suc
cessful salesmanship, along with evidence of your
inherent liking for it.
Naturally, any professional selling experience can
add a lot of weight to*just. exactly why it is you want
to sell.
Tiy honestly to answer this question in the affirma
tive--"Do 1 like to work without supervision?"
Your Sales Know-How
"What have you done lo prepare your <11 f<,i .sel
ling?" Is one the sal"s manager will U>> your way
Will you be able to name atfd comment he? I
seller books about salesmanship'.'
Can you name the steps to a proper sale?
Have you practiced thinking lik< a huyei , are you
aware ot these buying motives gain or economy,
comfort or convenience, safety or protection, and satis
faction or pride?
Have you succeeded in courses in salesmanship,
public speaking, arithmetic, and logic?
What to Sell and to Whom?
As a salesman, do you want to sell to the people in
grocery stores, industrial firms, distributing houses,
homes, or what? To women or men?
What do you really want to sell? Tangibles or in
tangibles?
For your own sake, you should want to sell a prod
uct which has a atabhj market in time- both good and
bad

Sell in What Location?
Are yoi| free to move or travel anywhere?
To succeed ifi a widespread company which prob
ably offers more opportunity because it is nol con
fined to one < ity or one stal.', yon mu:;l he willing to
accept opportunity wherever it occurs in Montana
or Massachusetts.
Married? r llien don't forget to ; k your wife how
she leels about your moving anywhere or your being
on the roar! five weeks out of six.
Which Company?
Say you want to si II drug' supplie because people
always have a need for them and they are sold to pro
pie in your chosen class of trade semi-professional
people
In this case, your best bet woul l'be to select four
or five of the largest national manufacturers of drug
supplies.
Purchase a lew of each firm's most popular items,
try them, test them, and find out lairly and honestly
which brand is the best.
Next, you might run an impart ial survey on each one
of the companies using this check list:
1. Consult the Better Business Bureau and Dun A
Brad.sti eet.
2. Review history of stock.
3. Interview company's advertising agency.
4. Call on customers a few each of your most
prominent local hospitals and drug stores, and get con
sumer opinion.
5. Visit wholesale distribution nutlets and ask sales
men about reputation in trade.
(i. Find out personnel policies,
7. Gather employee opinion.
Choose logically whidi manufacturer is best for
you and make an appointment witli the sales manager
of that company.
Arm yourself with the surveys and the products of
all five firms. Even if you have to hire a helicopter to
get into the sales manager's 10th floor office, don't
give up until you get to see him.
He will be buying and you're selling. He will be
quick and to the jxiint. He must extract from you
everything relating to those .six important questions.
Time here is an expense, and so is a series of test
that you may be asked to take. The sales managi i
must be careful, because every "salesman" who lasts
only long enough to break in his first new company car
is playing a losing hand against a return of productive
oiling which must be gained by the company to pay
for its Cost to sell.
It will have paid you to be just as careful, because il
it takes you three years to fail as a ale man, you will
have lost an investment of time which you may never
regain in any other field.
Don't w.nt to be asked for answers to the six ques
tions. Offer them spontaneously, in your most sincere,
straightforward manner. Tell and how the sales man
ager why his company is your first choice over hi*
major competitors.
The sales manager will be sure to hire you. For
you ve proved to him that you not only know his com
pany and its products, but what's even more im
pot taut you know youi <• 11 a- well'

help you to do ju.st that:
Why do I want to sell; what do I know abort sel-

ling; what kind of people do I
want to rail on; what do 112 want
to sell; where do I want to sell;
and what is my choice of com
panies?
Why Me in Selling?
Your desire to .sell should be
backed by a very definite liking
for people in general.
Anything that you've done per
sonally to build and expand your
relationships with people will ex-

■ ■■ m
plain your attraction to soiling.
Make your reach for a sales position reflect from
past experience how you already have employed suc
cessful salesmanship, along with evidence of your
inherent liking for it.
Naturally, any professional selling experience can
add a lot of weight to*just. exactly why it is you want
to sell.
Tiy honestly to answer this question in the affirma
tive--"Do 1 like to work without supervision?"
Your Sales Know-How
"What have you done lo prepare your <11 f<,i .sel
ling?" Is one the sal"s manager will U>> your way
Will you be able to name atfd comment he? I
seller books about salesmanship'.'
Can you name the steps to a proper sale?
Have you practiced thinking lik< a huyei , are you
aware ot these buying motives gain or economy,
comfort or convenience, safety or protection, and satis
faction or pride?
Have you succeeded in courses in salesmanship,
public speaking, arithmetic, and logic?
What to Sell and to Whom?
As a salesman, do you want to sell to the people in
grocery stores, industrial firms, distributing houses,
homes, or what? To women or men?
What do you really want to sell? Tangibles or in
tangibles?
For your own sake, you should want to sell a prod
uct which has a atabhj market in time- both good and
bad

Sell in What Location?
Are yoi| free to move or travel anywhere?
To succeed ifi a widespread company which prob
ably offers more opportunity because it is nol con
fined to one < ity or one stal.', yon mu:;l he willing to
accept opportunity wherever it occurs in Montana
or Massachusetts.
Married? r llien don't forget to ; k your wife how
she leels about your moving anywhere or your being
on the roar! five weeks out of six.
Which Company?
Say you want to si II drug' supplie because people
always have a need for them and they are sold to pro
pie in your chosen class of trade semi-professional
people
In this case, your best bet woul l'be to select four
or five of the largest national manufacturers of drug
supplies.
Purchase a lew of each firm's most popular items,
try them, test them, and find out lairly and honestly
which brand is the best.
Next, you might run an impart ial survey on each one
of the companies using this check list:
1. Consult the Better Business Bureau and Dun A
Brad.sti eet.
2. Review history of stock.
3. Interview company's advertising agency.
4. Call on customers a few each of your most
prominent local hospitals and drug stores, and get con
sumer opinion.
5. Visit wholesale distribution nutlets and ask sales
men about reputation in trade.
(i. Find out personnel policies,
7. Gather employee opinion.
Choose logically whidi manufacturer is best for
you and make an appointment witli the sales manager
of that company.
Arm yourself with the surveys and the products of
all five firms. Even if you have to hire a helicopter to
get into the sales manager's 10th floor office, don't
give up until you get to see him.
He will be buying and you're selling. He will be
quick and to the jxiint. He must extract from you
everything relating to those .six important questions.
Time here is an expense, and so is a series of test
that you may be asked to take. The sales managi i
must be careful, because every "salesman" who lasts
only long enough to break in his first new company car
is playing a losing hand against a return of productive
oiling which must be gained by the company to pay
for its Cost to sell.
It will have paid you to be just as careful, because il
it takes you three years to fail as a ale man, you will
have lost an investment of time which you may never
regain in any other field.
Don't w.nt to be asked for answers to the six ques
tions. Offer them spontaneously, in your most sincere,
straightforward manner. Tell and how the sales man
ager why his company is your first choice over hi*
major competitors.
The sales manager will be sure to hire you. For
you ve proved to him that you not only know his com
pany and its products, but what's even more im
pot taut you know youi <• 11 a- well'
