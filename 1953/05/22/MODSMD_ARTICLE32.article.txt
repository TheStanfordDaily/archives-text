# Spring Practice Concludes Today
## 
### 
Football, spring style, does its
bow-out this afternoon in the Sta
! dium.
Chuck Taylor's gridders will en
gage in a final intra-squad scrim
mage at 3:45 with the public wel
come. The intra-squad duel will be
| filmed.
This scrimmage will be the most
important in determining (1) who
will be invited back next year, (2)
which players excel in both ofTense
and defense, and (3) what the JC
transfers and frosh can do.
