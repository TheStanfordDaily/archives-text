Arson might well have caused the
fire that, swept through the large,
brown, shingled stable and water
tower on the Sharon estate Wed
nesday night, according to nn in
spector at the San Mateo County
sheriff's office.
Inspector Milton Minehan, inves
tigating the bla/.c, told the Daily
yesterday that arson was "definite
ly" being considered.
He pointed out thai the build
ing had long stood abandoned and
that there was nothing stored in
it that could have caused ignition.
A particularly strange aspect of
the fire, he said, is the fact that the
entire building was enveloped in
flame when firemen arrived. The
quick spread of the fire is unusual,
he intimated.
The large stable was built in 1910
by Fredrick Sharon as part of his
sweeping 600-acre estate. It. was
estimated to have cost $50,000. The
building had been abandoned since
19.'58.
Present owner of the property is
the Mcnlo Investment Co. It is un
derstood that the company plans to
subdivide the estate soon.
The (ire, perhaps the most spec
tacular in the vicinity for several
years, could have been far worse,
firemen say. They point out that
if the grass and trees mirroundiog
the stable had been drier the fire
could have flared down a nearj-by
ravine and into Mcnlo Park. â€¢
