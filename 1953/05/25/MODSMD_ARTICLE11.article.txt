## Planned Political Union To Hold Meeting Tonight 
### BARBARA TUERK 
A Political Union, where student members are organized into
opposing parties to debate current issues—that's what's in the
wind for Stanford.
The Student Faculty Political Committee has called an open
meeting for 7:30 tonight in Room 53, Gubberley, so that students

interested in the new organization
can help plan it.
A .student, committee will be ap
pointed tonight to draw up tempo
rary by-laws for the new union and
to organize its firstpmecting next fall.
A live man sub-committee of the
Student Faculty Political Committee
has been working on plans for the
new Union for several weeks. Exeom
recommended in April that .such a
Union be considered.
The report of (his committee
recommends the formation of a
Union like Yale's and Oxford's
with members divided into at least
two parties for debating. Under its
plan there would be a third 'in
dependent'' bench for members
who didn't want to join either
party.
Under the University's present po
litical regulations parties in the Un
ion could caucus separately to study
debate topics. However, they could
meet only for study and debate, and
could take no part in political action.
The Union's parties would not
be affiliated in jftiy way with the
off-campus Youn,<? Democrats and
Young Republicans.
Some members of the sub-com
mittee suggested that other parties
such as Socialist Labor and Chris
tian Nationalist could have official
standing in the Union if they en
rolled at least 10 per ccnt of the ac
tive membership.
Members of the sub-committee in
cluded students from the Young Re
publicans, the Young Democrats, the
Debate Board, and the Political
Committee. They were: Tim Sharpe,
Dave Jacobsen, Geoff England, Jack
Fraser, and Bill Fundenberg.
