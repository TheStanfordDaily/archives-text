# 'U.S. Is Not Informed'
## 'Sell Ourselves, Says Newsman 
### DOROTHY DODGE Editorial Assistant, The Daily 
"Wo pride ourselves on being the j
, best-informed people in the world—
| that is a gross exaggeration," News
| Commentator William Winter told a I
Stanford geopolitics class yester- '
I day.
We need to know more about the
peoples of the world and to do a
hotter job of selling ourselves to!

turned two weeks ago from an
Asian tour. He spoke to the Geog
raphy 200 class of Dr. Alfred Sum
ner, who replaced Winter during his
absence on one of the newsman's
KPIX TV shows.
Winter gave a none-too-optimis
tic rundown on people, places, and
politics in the Aijian trouble areas:
FORMOSA: The two million Chi
j jie.se there arc "eager and deter- |
mined to return to Ihe mainland."
But their chances of returning are
nil. Winter suggested that if they
should accomplish a landing across
the 100-mile channel between them
and China, the mainlandcrs would
either follow a scorched-earth policy
or they would fight . . . and if the
former, the Nationalists would be
| lost.
i KOREA: Synghman Rlicc "insists

I on a unified Korea and he will be
I satisfied with nothing short of a
drive to the Yalu River." Asked if
the United States' stand on prison
ers of war was Retting across to the
Asians, Winter said that the people
generally were more interested in
where the next bowl of rice was
cominß from. The intellectuals he
talked to were for the most part
sympathetic with the U.S. stand,
though they all want desperately
for the war to end.

Winter whs in Pantnunjom when
the exchanges of prisoners went
through. He reported that, many of
the men were "shabbily—in fact,
brutally" treated at times, but that
the treatment had improved since
the truce talks.
JAPAN: Japanese big business
men are the only group which real
ly hopes the Korean war will con
tinue. They are currently driving
to succeed the British and Ameri
cans as the main industrial provider
to East Asia. They reason they have
the advantage of low production
costs, geographical closeness, and
racial affinity.
"Japanese democracy is not the
American variety," he declared.
But reforms like woman suffrage
and freedom of the press have taken
a strong hold. The Japanese gener
ally show a much stronger feeling
of regret and responsibility toward
| World War II than the Germans, for
i example.

politics in the Aijian trouble areas:
FORMOSA: The two million Chi
j jie.se there arc "eager and deter- |
mined to return to Ihe mainland."
But their chances of returning are
nil. Winter suggested that if they
should accomplish a landing across
the 100-mile channel between them
and China, the mainlandcrs would
either follow a scorched-earth policy
or they would fight . . . and if the
former, the Nationalists would be
| lost.
i KOREA: Synghman Rlicc "insists

I on a unified Korea and he will be
I satisfied with nothing short of a
drive to the Yalu River." Asked if
the United States' stand on prison
ers of war was Retting across to the
Asians, Winter said that the people
generally were more interested in
where the next bowl of rice was
cominß from. The intellectuals he
talked to were for the most part
sympathetic with the U.S. stand,
though they all want desperately
for the war to end.

Winter whs in Pantnunjom when
the exchanges of prisoners went
through. He reported that, many of
the men were "shabbily—in fact,
brutally" treated at times, but that
the treatment had improved since
the truce talks.
JAPAN: Japanese big business
men are the only group which real
ly hopes the Korean war will con
tinue. They are currently driving
to succeed the British and Ameri
cans as the main industrial provider
to East Asia. They reason they have
the advantage of low production
costs, geographical closeness, and
racial affinity.
"Japanese democracy is not the
American variety," he declared.
But reforms like woman suffrage
and freedom of the press have taken
a strong hold. The Japanese gener
ally show a much stronger feeling
of regret and responsibility toward
| World War II than the Germans, for
i example.
