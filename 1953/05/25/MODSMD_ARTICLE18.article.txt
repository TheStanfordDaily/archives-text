# CAMPUS OPINION
## Answer to Payson 
### 
To the Editor:
I am writing this letter in order to answer some of
the questions and to challenge some of the state
ments Ken Payson made in his letter to the editor
of May 21, 1953.
He asks in a parenthesis . . For what can you do
when vou can't prove a person something you know
he is: I answer that, in all fairness, one should
make known the bases of one's knowledge about the
character and habits of a person whom one ac
cuses. It is not right to assume omniscence when one
accuses a person of embracing such an evil philos
ophy as Communism, especially since such accusa
tions become almost immediately proof positive of
guilt for the popular mind. But McCarthy, unable
to find bases for his accusations in fact, resorts
to the Big Lie policy used so successfully by Hitler,
Mussolini, and Stalin.
Indeed we do need "more men in Washington
who by the strength of their convictions are unafraid
to stand up in front of us and declare what they be
lieve to be true, right, and just." But we need men
who are also circumspect, who are careful that they
accuse only when they possess all the neccessary in
formation about those whom they accuse. Selfless,
disinterested men are concerned with their contribu
tions toward the betterment of the nation, not with
self-aggrandizement and self-identification with all
things noble and good.
McCarthy has been trying, and, I am ashamed to
admit, has been succeeding, in identifying McCarthy
ism with patriotism. I fear that we may not realize
the full implication of this self-contradictory slogan
before its mind-dwarfing tendencies have been ef
fected.
Payson states in his letter: "Finally, since when is
it the prime purpose ol educators (who supposedly
believe in academic freedom, see editorial section
the Daily, May 18) to import upon students their
ideas and beliefs? I thought it was the prime purpose
oi education to teach the students some facts and

then permit the students to arrive at their own con
clusions and ideas!"
The prime purpose of education is not "to teach
the students some facts, etc." Educators exist in
order to teach students to think for themselves. One
can learn the facts of mathematics; but if'he ends
up with a demonstrably wrong arjswer, then he has
not employed these facts correctly. It is one of the
educator's jobs to see that the students get the
facts, certainly; but the primary job of the teacher
is to try to indicate to the student how the facts may
be variously interpreted, and to indicate the methods
which one employs in attempting to interpret them.
The facts are presented, not taught. 7 What is taught
is the understanding, interpreting, balancing of facts,
one set against another, in order that the student
may arrive at the intelligent, reasoned, and defensible
conclusion.

The Fundamental Standard Committee wishes to
express its appreciation for the interest shown by
the student body in the work of our committee dur
ing our recent interviews for new members. Some
55 students were interviewed for the five openings on
the committee and our selection was made very dif
ficult by both the number and the high quality of the
applicants.
In choosing our new members we looked for quali
fications as regards class year, time available for
committee work next year, and expressed interest
in the work and the function of the committee.
We wish to thank all those who tried out and for
whom we could not find a place on the committee.
We appreciate their interest and hope it will con
tinue in active expression next year.

THE FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD
COMMITTEE
To the Editor:
I am writing this letter in order to answer some of
the questions and to challenge some of the state
ments Ken Payson made in his letter to the editor
of May 21, 1953.
He asks in a parenthesis . . For what can you do
when vou can't prove a person something you know
he is: I answer that, in all fairness, one should
make known the bases of one's knowledge about the
character and habits of a person whom one ac
cuses. It is not right to assume omniscence when one
accuses a person of embracing such an evil philos
ophy as Communism, especially since such accusa
tions become almost immediately proof positive of
guilt for the popular mind. But McCarthy, unable
to find bases for his accusations in fact, resorts
to the Big Lie policy used so successfully by Hitler,
Mussolini, and Stalin.
Indeed we do need "more men in Washington
who by the strength of their convictions are unafraid
to stand up in front of us and declare what they be
lieve to be true, right, and just." But we need men
who are also circumspect, who are careful that they
accuse only when they possess all the neccessary in
formation about those whom they accuse. Selfless,
disinterested men are concerned with their contribu
tions toward the betterment of the nation, not with
self-aggrandizement and self-identification with all
things noble and good.
McCarthy has been trying, and, I am ashamed to
admit, has been succeeding, in identifying McCarthy
ism with patriotism. I fear that we may not realize
the full implication of this self-contradictory slogan
before its mind-dwarfing tendencies have been ef
fected.
Payson states in his letter: "Finally, since when is
it the prime purpose ol educators (who supposedly
believe in academic freedom, see editorial section
the Daily, May 18) to import upon students their
ideas and beliefs? I thought it was the prime purpose
oi education to teach the students some facts and

then permit the students to arrive at their own con
clusions and ideas!"
The prime purpose of education is not "to teach
the students some facts, etc." Educators exist in
order to teach students to think for themselves. One
can learn the facts of mathematics; but if'he ends
up with a demonstrably wrong arjswer, then he has
not employed these facts correctly. It is one of the
educator's jobs to see that the students get the
facts, certainly; but the primary job of the teacher
is to try to indicate to the student how the facts may
be variously interpreted, and to indicate the methods
which one employs in attempting to interpret them.
The facts are presented, not taught. 7 What is taught
is the understanding, interpreting, balancing of facts,
one set against another, in order that the student
may arrive at the intelligent, reasoned, and defensible
conclusion.

To the Editor:
The Fundamental Standard Committee wishes to
express its appreciation for the interest shown by
the student body in the work of our committee dur
ing our recent interviews for new members. Some
55 students were interviewed for the five openings on
the committee and our selection was made very dif
ficult by both the number and the high quality of the
applicants.
In choosing our new members we looked for quali
fications as regards class year, time available for
committee work next year, and expressed interest
in the work and the function of the committee.
We wish to thank all those who tried out and for
whom we could not find a place on the committee.
We appreciate their interest and hope it will con
tinue in active expression next year.
