# COMING THURSDAY
## Wives Laugh, Falstaff Quaffs in Comic Opera 
### JERRY SIMPSON 
Chairs are overturned, wine cellars are ransacked, and clothes
closets are rifled as an irate husband searches for his wife's would
be lover in the annual opera production by the Stanford Players
and the Music Department of Giuseppe Verdi's immortal comic,
"Falstaff."
Sir John Falstaff (Francis Barnes) was one of the more colorful,

freo-ch'inking men about town in
merry old England in the days when
night life wasn't limited to a lively
party in one of the local pubs. With
two of his erstwhile friends, Bar
dofT (William Bond) and Pistol
(William Windcn), FalstafT makes
the rounds from tavern to tavern
with the redness of Bardoff's nose
lighting the way through the murky
darkness.
It is on one of these midnight
escapades that FalstafT falls into
evil ways and the situations that
result provide many of the comic
scenes for which the opera is
noted.
The plot thickcns and intrigue
enters the lively story as FalstafT
dispatches some glowing love letters
to a pair of local beauties. He means
to test their virtue by means of
these notes. The ladies (Ruth Roehr
and Joan Stensen), however, arc
happily married and burst into gales
of laughter when they compare the
letters and discover they are both
from "that fat old fool FalstafT."
To lead FalstafT on a merry
chase and to teach him a lesson
Mistress Ford arranges to have
him call at her house when her
husband will not he at home. Full
of pride and boasting, FalstafT
clips his moustacTie, shines his
hoots, and makes a hasty advance
to Mistress Ford's door."
Secure in the belief that his art
ful wiles in the art of lovemaking
will not bear bitter fruit, FalstafT
is enjoying himself immensely when
the muffled steps of the returning
husband arc heard in the court
yard.
The succss of FalstafT's attempt
to hide and the fate of the erring
wife will be determined when the
curtain goes up on opening night.

The Stanford Players and the
Music Department have assembled
a cast of young professional sing
ers, four of them students at Stan
ford. two of them former students,
and the others especially invited
guests.

Chairs are overturned, wine cellars are ransacked, and clothes
closets are rifled as an irate husband searches for his wife's would
be lover in the annual opera production by the Stanford Players
and the Music Department of Giuseppe Verdi's immortal comic,
"Falstaff."
Sir John Falstaff (Francis Barnes) was one of the more colorful,

freo-ch'inking men about town in
merry old England in the days when
night life wasn't limited to a lively
party in one of the local pubs. With
two of his erstwhile friends, Bar
dofT (William Bond) and Pistol
(William Windcn), FalstafT makes
the rounds from tavern to tavern
with the redness of Bardoff's nose
lighting the way through the murky
darkness.
It is on one of these midnight
escapades that FalstafT falls into
evil ways and the situations that
result provide many of the comic
scenes for which the opera is
noted.
The plot thickcns and intrigue
enters the lively story as FalstafT
dispatches some glowing love letters
to a pair of local beauties. He means
to test their virtue by means of
these notes. The ladies (Ruth Roehr
and Joan Stensen), however, arc
happily married and burst into gales
of laughter when they compare the
letters and discover they are both
from "that fat old fool FalstafT."
To lead FalstafT on a merry
chase and to teach him a lesson
Mistress Ford arranges to have
him call at her house when her
husband will not he at home. Full
of pride and boasting, FalstafT
clips his moustacTie, shines his
hoots, and makes a hasty advance
to Mistress Ford's door."
Secure in the belief that his art
ful wiles in the art of lovemaking
will not bear bitter fruit, FalstafT
is enjoying himself immensely when
the muffled steps of the returning
husband arc heard in the court
yard.
The succss of FalstafT's attempt
to hide and the fate of the erring
wife will be determined when the
curtain goes up on opening night.

The Stanford Players and the
Music Department have assembled
a cast of young professional sing
ers, four of them students at Stan
ford. two of them former students,
and the others especially invited
guests.
