# Dealing the Cards
## A Great Week and Bob Mathias
### DICK MALTZMAN 
The Daily picked a nice week to close. This weekend we will have prob
ably the greatest field athletic events ever to be run off on the Stanford
campus. On the one hand we have the PCC Track and Field Champion
ships this Friday and Saturday in Stanford Stadium. Also on Friday
and Saturday (a doubleheader if the series is still undecided), the Stanford
Indians will fight it out with the Ducks of Oregon for the PCC baseball
championship—the winner to go to the NCAA playoffs.
On track, we would like to take this space to mention to the 7,000 and
some students attending Stanford that one Robert Bruce Mathias will
participate for the last time on the Stanford campus and for the last time
in his school colors, most likely, in this week's PCC's.
Jack Weiershauser. Bob's coach for the last four years, brought out the
point several weeks back that, "Almost everyone in the school at one time
or another has seen Bob on the football field—not more than 10 per cent
have seen him in a track suit Would you consider Mathias a better track
man or football player? Well we tend to think that Mr. Weiershauser was
talking a lot of sense when he made that statement. This weekend will
be the last time for the other 90 per cent to see the world record holder
and two time winner of the OlympirDecathlon in action—and for nothin'
on Friday and only 75 cents on Saturday.
On the baseball championships, there is still talk of USC demanding a
berth in the NCAA championships. The grounds—a tie with Stanford in
the CIBA. The score as we see it: Stanford has a championship (the PCC,
southern division) and a half and SC has a half. Add tb this four convinc
ing victories ovei' the Trojans by Stanford and the grounds seem to get
a little muddy. Thus you will see Stanford play a series this weekend
with Oregon and the winner will go to the playoffs, if invited by the NCAA
commissioners.

For the last three years, Stanford has been beaten for the basketball
championships in the first few weeks of the season.
League play starts at the beginning of winter quarter, and so does rush
ing. Now the great majority of Stanford basketball players are in fraterni
ties or eating clubs, and fraternity and eating clubs hold parties and such
for the benefit of prospective pledges. And in most cases, these parties
are compulsory even for the basketball player with a crucial series coming
up on the weekend. And these parties seldom follow the training require
ments of the winning athlete.
Now let us take a brief look at the record: In 1950-51. the Indians started
with a great pace, wiping everyone in the pie-season play. They even
went to Madison Square Garden, where they were forthwith handled by
NYU. And then they entered season play, and got completely wiped by
everyone for three weeks before they could find their composure and start
winning again. We finished the season far out of the money.
In th 1951-52 season, we were heavy favorites to take the conference. We
again looked great in the beginning of the yar, startd the season, and pro
ceeded to let USC sweep a crucial seiies from us. Later on in the season
when we began to look like a basketball team again, we trounced the Tro
jans twice to even the score and wind up the season with a .500 record in
league play and a tie for second.
And then this year. From January 2 to 24 the Indians lost 8 of their
nine games, and wound up the first half of league play squarely in the cel
lar. We stayed there.
And how does this lack ol punch in the beginning of the season reflect on
rushing? Well, in words of basketball coach Bob Burnett, "If an athlete is
going to stay up all hours of the night, partying it up during rushing, he
isn't going to be in shape to give out with a good game. I realize that a lot
of these parties are compulsory, but it is up to the athletes to stand up
for themselves. When I was in school, this same problem arose. The house
wants the athletes to appear to impress the pledges, but the athlete needs
his conditioning. His presence is fine as long as he doesn't break training.
We always backed out and went to bed when the time came, and the house,
interested in our performance, always backed us up. There is strictly
nothing that can be done to pressure the boys or the houses, it is up to
them to appreciate what is best for themselves and do it." On the other
hand, Coach Burnett didn't want to use this an "an excuse for losing basket
ball games"—but if we are losing and the boys are partying . . . We tend
to go along with the coach—there really isn't too much anyone can do to
pressure the individuals or the houses—it is up to them. An athlete has
physical capabilities that are a gift worth keeping, and we feel it is his
responsibility to keep himself from drinking and partying it away.
