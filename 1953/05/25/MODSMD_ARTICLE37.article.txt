his hit into a double, was thrown
out. With Essegian at hat Stanick
uncorked a wild pitch which
brought Goodrich home.
Murphy, meanwhile, had the Sea
Hawk nihe eating out of his hand,
as he allowed a single to Ken Rose
in the first and then proceeded to
issue two walks and no hits the next
five innings.
Stanick had also settled down and
aside from an infield single by Dick

role in the fifth \va.s never in trou
ble.
In the Alameda eighth, however,
part of the storm broke. After
getting the first two batters. Page
proceeded to hit Rose and then
loaded the bases by walking Ron
nie Ertola and Rich Burt.
Page then came in with a 3 and 2
pitch to Joe Kirrene and the latter
lofted a foul to left Essegian made
a gallant try, but stumbled on the
batting practice pitcher's mound
and dropped the ball. Page then
walked Kirrene forcing in Rose.
He retired Reno Deßenedetti on a
fly ball.
The Cards retaliated in their
half of the eighth and grabbed a
2-1 lead when Len Swartz walked
and was sacrificed to second by Page.
Rich Scramaglia drew a walk and
Goodrich grounded to the pitcher
who threw to second to nip Scra
maglia, but the throw to first for the
double play was into the dirt en
abling Goodrich to go safe. Swartz
who never stopped running, scored
on the play.
Alameda wasn't to be denied, how
ever, as they came back with two
runs in the ninth although they did
not get a ball out of the infield.
Jack Haley sent a chopper to
third which Ray Swarts couldn't
make a play on. Then after Jim
Atkinson fanned, Don lyionroe
bunted for a basehit. and Haley
who had pilfered second, moved
to third. Monroe then stole second.
Page, pitching to pinch swinger
Tito Barheri, wild pitched. Haley
scored and Monroe went to third.
Barberi then grounded to Good
rich, who hobbled the ball giving
him a life, while Monroe held
third.
Rose then bounced back to Page,
who hesitated about throwing to the
plate and finally fired to first too late
enabling the winning run to score.

STANICK, Becker (9) and Burt:
Murphy. PAGE (6) and Swartz.
They failed to defeat Alameda
Ccast Guard nine for the third
time this season as the Sea
Hawks eked out a 3-2 victory
yesterday afternoon on the Sun
ken Diamond. And for the sec
ond time Alameda came from
behind to win.
There were no booming bats as
visiting pitcher Joe Stanick and Card
ace Bob Murphy hooked-up in % a
pitching duel. Murphy, after five
innings gave way to Phil Page, who
carried on successfully until the
eighth and ninth when he lost con
trol and the ball game.
The Cards, who scheduled the
contest in order to tune up for the
weekend tilts with Oregon to de
cide the PCC championship, start
ed off the right note in the first
inning.
Warren Goodrich laced a single
to center with one out and moved
to third when Al Talhoy hlooped
a base-hit to left on a hit and run
play. Talhoy attempting to stretch
his hit into a double, was thrown
out. With Essegian at hat Stanick
uncorked a wild pitch which
brought Goodrich home.
Murphy, meanwhile, had the Sea
Hawk nihe eating out of his hand,
as he allowed a single to Ken Rose
in the first and then proceeded to
issue two walks and no hits the next
five innings.
Stanick had also settled down and
aside from an infield single by Dick

role in the fifth \va.s never in trou
ble.
In the Alameda eighth, however,
part of the storm broke. After
getting the first two batters. Page
proceeded to hit Rose and then
loaded the bases by walking Ron
nie Ertola and Rich Burt.
Page then came in with a 3 and 2
pitch to Joe Kirrene and the latter
lofted a foul to left Essegian made
a gallant try, but stumbled on the
batting practice pitcher's mound
and dropped the ball. Page then
walked Kirrene forcing in Rose.
He retired Reno Deßenedetti on a
fly ball.
The Cards retaliated in their
half of the eighth and grabbed a
2-1 lead when Len Swartz walked
and was sacrificed to second by Page.
Rich Scramaglia drew a walk and
Goodrich grounded to the pitcher
who threw to second to nip Scra
maglia, but the throw to first for the
double play was into the dirt en
abling Goodrich to go safe. Swartz
who never stopped running, scored
on the play.
Alameda wasn't to be denied, how
ever, as they came back with two
runs in the ninth although they did
not get a ball out of the infield.
Jack Haley sent a chopper to
third which Ray Swarts couldn't
make a play on. Then after Jim
Atkinson fanned, Don lyionroe
bunted for a basehit. and Haley
who had pilfered second, moved
to third. Monroe then stole second.
Page, pitching to pinch swinger
Tito Barheri, wild pitched. Haley
scored and Monroe went to third.
Barberi then grounded to Good
rich, who hobbled the ball giving
him a life, while Monroe held
third.
Rose then bounced back to Page,
who hesitated about throwing to the
plate and finally fired to first too late
enabling the winning run to score.
