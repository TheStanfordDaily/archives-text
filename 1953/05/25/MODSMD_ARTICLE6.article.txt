### Erickson Mansfield 
A red devil's head leered down
from the cross atop Memorial
Church onto the Sermon on the
Mount mural on the Inner Quad
facade last night, a result apparently
of the work of pranksters.
"We've been trying to chase the
devil off the Stanford campus," said

Chaplain Robert Minto, "and this
one's going to go fast!"
The devil's head, which was fas
tened to the fagadc just beneath the
cross, was spotted by Daily photog
rapher Glenn Erickson at approxi
mately 7:30 p.m. yesterday. A sub
sequent attempt by Daily staffers
to remove the' object proved futile.
At last report, the Stanford police
were taking the matter in hand.
Chaplain Minto considered the
prank in "very poor taste."
