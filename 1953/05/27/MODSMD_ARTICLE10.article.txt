The devil's sojourn alop Memo
rial Church was .a short one.
At 8:30 a.m. yesterday Corp Yard
men, intent upon removing the
grinning Lucifer from the Mem
Church cross, found that someone
had mysteriously beaten them to it.
Neither they nor the Rev. Robert
Minto, University chaplain, could
offer any explanation of how the
devil was removed.
There is an entrance to the church
roof from the attic, hut ;it 9:30 p.m.,
before Minto locked all entrances to
the church, campus police made a
thorough check and found no one
inside.
The other possibility was that
someone scaled the church walls
from the outside. According to Corp
Yard official George Green, it would
be easy to get to the top of the
roof with two 20-foot ladders.
But Police Chief Gordon Davis
said the police officer on duty in
Inner Quad until 2 a.m. saw no
one near the church. Police cars
patrol Inner Quad all night.
And Corp Yard workmen and po
lice say that there are no ladders
of that size available to students.
Other theories floating around
campus include ropes, helicopters,

human flics, and the Alpine Club.
And, of course, divine intervention.
Chief Davis suggested that maybe
someone hid in the church before
it was locked and was not found.
Chaplain Minto hinted that a win
dow might have been opened.
The devil was first sighted at
7:15 p.m. Monday by Daily pho
tographer Glenn Erickson. No
one knows when it first appeared
on the cross.
The church was open all day and
from 7 to fl p,jn. ivfonday. Students
entering at that time could have
climbed onto the roof from the attic.
But how was it removed?
"I don't know," said Chaplain
Minto.
"I don't know," said Police Chief
Davis.
"I don't know," said George
Green from the Corporation Yard.
"We don't know," said the Alpine
Club.
"We don't know," said the Fire
Department.
Only God knows.

"Do you think there's only one
devil in Memorial Church?" the
Rev. Robert Minto asked Daily
reporters who had tried unsuc
cessfully to evict Satan from his
perch.
When they said they weren't
sure, the chaplain showed them a
second devil perched on the neck
of Judas Iscariot in the mosaic of
the "Last Supper" directly behind
the altar.
The mosaic is a copy of the
original by Cosimo Rossclli in the
Sistinc Chapel in the Vatican at
Rome. Special permission for the
copy was given to Mrs. Stanford
by the Vatican. It has the small
est tiles of any mosaic in the
church.
