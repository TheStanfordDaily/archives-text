# Baseball Team Must Play USC, Seattle, Or San Diego, NCAA Committee Rules
## 'Confused' Decision Met With Protests by Stanford Officials 
### DON WEBSTER 
In an unexpected and confusing move, the NCAA District 8
selection committee has called for a three-way playoff this week
i end between USC, Seattle, and San Diego State, the winning team
to face Stanford next week. However, the selection committee's
decision may force Stanford to withdraw from NCAA competitiorl.

The committee, headed b> Cali
fornia Baseball Coach Clint Evans,
called for two double-headers at
Bovard Field. Two teams will play
the first contest Friday, the winner
to play the remaining clug in the
second game. Saturday morning,
the two losing teams play. Finally,
Saturday afternoon, the Friday
winner and the Saturday winner
meet.
Secondly, the committee said that
the winner of the Oregon-Stanford
series would play the winner of the
USC games the following weekend,
June 5 and 6, which are the first
two days of finals at Stanford.
It is still uncertain whether or
not the faculty will allow games to
be played on these two days, but it
is doubtful, especially since the

winner would have to be in Omaha
on June 11, the day after finals. This
means that players missing finals
due to a series would have no
chance to make them up later.
The alternative plan is to play
the winner of that series Monday,
Tuesday, and Wednesday, but it i%
doubtful that the other school
would agree to such a plan for
two reasons: (1) having played
up to four games the previous
weekend, their pitchers would be
at a disadvantage; and (2) finals
at USC (if they win) start on that
Monday.
The decisions of the committee
were particularly disturbing to
