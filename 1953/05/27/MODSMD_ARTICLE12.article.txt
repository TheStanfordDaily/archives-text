# Baseball Team Must Play USC, Seattle, Or San Diego, NCAA Committee Rules
## 'Confused' Decision Met With Protests by Stanford Officials 
### DON WEBSTER 
In an unexpected and confusing move, the NCAA District 8
selection committee has called for a three-way playoff this week
i end between USC, Seattle, and San Diego State, the winning team
to face Stanford next week. However, the selection committee's
decision may force Stanford to withdraw from NCAA competitiorl.

The committee, headed b> Cali
fornia Baseball Coach Clint Evans,
called for two double-headers at
Bovard Field. Two teams will play
the first contest Friday, the winner
to play the remaining clug in the
second game. Saturday morning,
the two losing teams play. Finally,
Saturday afternoon, the Friday
winner and the Saturday winner
meet.
Secondly, the committee said that
the winner of the Oregon-Stanford
series would play the winner of the
USC games the following weekend,
June 5 and 6, which are the first
two days of finals at Stanford.
It is still uncertain whether or
not the faculty will allow games to
be played on these two days, but it
is doubtful, especially since the

winner would have to be in Omaha
on June 11, the day after finals. This
means that players missing finals
due to a series would have no
chance to make them up later.
The alternative plan is to play
the winner of that series Monday,
Tuesday, and Wednesday, but it i%
doubtful that the other school
would agree to such a plan for
two reasons: (1) having played
up to four games the previous
weekend, their pitchers would be
at a disadvantage; and (2) finals
at USC (if they win) start on that
Monday.
The decisions of the committee
were particularly disturbing to
Stanford oHicials on two counts: the j
selection of USC and the date of ■
the final playoffs.
It was thought by many people
that Oregon State had more right
to u playoff invitation than the Tro
jans. USC lost the league because !
of four losses to the Indians, while j
OSC lost because of a rained-out I
pair of games to last-place Wash
ington.
(Ed. note: Oregon won the j
league by a half - game when,
after defeating OSC by one run j
in the first of four games, they
had the next three contests rained j
out, thus "backing in" to the
championship.)
When asked about his decision. \
Evans said that teams could not be
chosen on the assumption that they i
would have won rained-out games
he had to select only according to ■
the record.
This statement infuriated Athletic (
Director AI Masters, Coach Everett
Dean, and the players of the team, j
One player said, "If he is picking !
according only to the record, what :
do our four wins over USC mean
to him?"
Masters, in a phone conversation

with Evans, termed the selection
"ridiculous." "What," he asked Ev
ans, "would Oregon say if they de
feated us two straight, and then had
to play USC, a team Stanford de
feated four times?"
Site of the final series will he
announced today, Evans said.
However, if the site chosen is !
USC, San Diego, or Seattle, it is
almost a certainty Stanford would
he forced to withdraw because of
final exams.
Teams to play this weekend in the
| first Los Angeles game will be de
. termined by the Hip of a coin. When
; the finals week of Seattle and San
Diego occurs is not yet known to
| Stanford officials, and it is hoped
1 that, if one of them should win the \
series, they would agree to playing '
early next week.
Director of Admissions Rixford
' Snyder, Masters, and several other
officials met yesterday afternoon to
j try and determine how Stanford
{ should act on the various issues. It I
i was agreed that the dead-week rule i
j could be broken in this case and j
' have the games during the early ;
| week, but no decision could be
reached on the finals - weekend
I issue.
