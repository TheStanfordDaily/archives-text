# Thomson Advises Critics 'Learn to Describe Music'
## 
### R.G. MANSFIELD 
"A muse critic should learn to ;
describe music. In reviewing .
a concert, opinion is the least
important thing. After all, music I
criticism is merely a form of re-!
porting."
Virgil Thomson, for thirteen years j
music critic for the New York Her- j
aid Tribune, has that advice to of- |
fer to students of music criticism.
And according to Thomson, there ;
arc many young critics coming |
"I have dozens of boys working
for me," ftc said. "I give them small
reviews to write, and none of them
arc very good at first, no matter how
much music they know. But they i
catch on after a while. They get, !
into the tone."
Thomson lias written three
hooks on music and has been mu
sic critic for the Boston Transcript,
Vanity Fair, and Modern Music.
He lias been with the Herald Trib
une since 15140. He is currently
visiting Stanford to give a scries j
of lectures and appearances.
Giving more of his views on mu
sic criticism, Thomson says: "A critic
ought to pay an artist the compli
ment of writing carefully and well.
The artist has worked hard to pro
duce his best performance; the crit
ic should do the same."
"You can be as 'mean' as you like
in a review as long as yfu arc cour
teous and can cite definite exam
ples."
Thomson is as well-known for his
work as a composer of various mu
sical forms as for his music riticism. |
He composed the music for "Four
Saints in Three Acts" and "Mother of
Us All," operas with text by Ger
trude Stein, and"The Plough that
Broke the Plains" and"The River,"
films by Pare Lorentz.
Speaking from the composer's
viewpoint, Thomson did not want
to he pinned down for comments
•mi his contemporaries. However,
he seemed quite pleased by what
he heard n( the Monday Stanford
student composers' workshop held j
at the Knoll under his supervis
ion.
"It was just lovely," he said. "I j
had the time of my life. The com- J
positions were well written and
quite well played."
Speaking of his own music critic |
activities in New York, Thomson
says:"I like to spread myself around
outside the regular categories. I'll
drop in on a church service, a mu- i
sical show, a jam session . . ."
Thomson will remain on campus
until tomorrow night to hear the |
first performance of "FalstafT" in
cmorial Auditorium. His last ap
pearance will be this afternoon at
4:15 in the Women's Clubhouse,
when he will deliver a lecture on |
"The Music Critic and His Respon
sibility.-'
