## 
### RUTH JAHNKE 
"You always get cither comedy
or nonsense when you change ac
cents in the English language," stated
Virgil Thomson in last night's Tues
day Evening Series lecture on
"Words and Music."
Thomson, noted music critic, and
composer, added that stress, or ac
ent, Ls far more rigid in English
than other European languages.
Thomson said that stresses are the
strongest elements in the English
language. Syncopation, he contin
ued, is the result of conflict between
the short sounds and the stresses.
"Cadence in modern English is
free and often quite fanciful," Thom
son stated. (Carfcnce is the up and
down design of a melody of phrase).
He suggested that Chaucerian Eng
lish had certain set cadences, hut
commented that such strict cadence
patterns are now peculiar to dialec
tual speech only and arc not con
sidered desirable.
Thomson said, "Music and poetry
grew up together . . . now they live
apart." In discussing the properties
of a good song, lie said "The elements
are mated, not merely living together
and getting in each other's way."
Later, while discussing the prob
lem of producing in English versus
operas in other languages, Thomson
stated that, "The problem of opera
in English is one of repertory. When
we have fifteen really good operas,
then opera in English will be recog
nized along with German, French,

and Italian."
Last night's lecture was the last
in the spring quarter Tuesday Eve
ning Series. They will resume .sum
mer quarter.
