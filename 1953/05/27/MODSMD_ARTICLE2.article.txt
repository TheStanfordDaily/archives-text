### 
TOKYO, Wednesday, May 27 (UP) —South Korea's foreign min
ister hinted broadly Tuesday night that his government had boy
cotted the Korean truce talks in protest against a new Allied
peace plan.
The indication of a South Korean walkout followed an emer-

jjency meeting of President Syngman
Rhee and his cabinet. Later Rhec
met with the chiefs of his army,
navy and air force.
Foreign Ministecr Pyun Yung Tai
said the South Korean delegate to
the Panmunjom conference "might
persist in the actions he has just
taken if what made him refrain
from attendance remains." •
Maj. Gecn. Choi Duk Son, the del
egate, did not attend the meeting
Monday at which the Allies handed
the Communists a compromise pro
posal for breaking an armistice
deadlock over war prisoners.
South Korean sources said Gen.
Mark W. Clark told Rhec at a Mon
day meeting that he should sup
port. the Allied plan even if he did
not agree with it. Rhee was de
scribed as disturbed because he was
not consulted when the proposal was
drafted.
