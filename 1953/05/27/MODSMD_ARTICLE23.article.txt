# Medieval Costumes, Sets Featured in 'Falstaff' Opera
## 
### JERRY SIMPSON 
A subtle blend of medieval
patterns coupled with a large
array of modern colors marks
the efforts of the costume and
set designers for the Stanford
Playeis' and the Music Depart
ment's production of "Falstaff,"
which will be produced tomor
row, Friday, and Saturday in
Memorial Auditorium at 8:15.
Tickets for the production may bo
purchased for $1 at Memorial Au
ditorium Or the Peninsula Box Of
fice.
According to Virginia Opsvig,
costume designer for the produc
tion, there has been an attempt to
capture the spirit of medieval days
by tiding basic diess designs of that
eia flavored with a great deal of
modern coloring.
The production calls tor a large
variety of costumes to depict many
different moods and personalities.
PagL boy ~ scullery maids, and local
barflies are only a lew of the va
riety of costumes demanded for a
successful production. Special at
tention has been paid to .see that
the costumes are in keeping with
the spirit the music imposes.
The l! "me followed in the de
signing ol the costumes was not
chosen in the traditional means.
There has been no attepint to cre
ate an exact replica of the late
11th century nor has there been
any effort toward authenticity.
The inspiration for a theme comes
not from any art hooks or peri
odicals concerning the era, hut
from the inspired pen of Oiuseppe
Verdi. The underlying basis for
the costume designs in this pro
duction comes from the music.
The opera is unique in its cos

tuming demands. The majority of
opera lovers do not come primarily
to see the efforts of the costume and
set designer, nor are they solely in
terested in the exactness ol a sing
er's portrayal of a character. They
come to hear the music. Any cos
tume, prop, or bit of stage make-up
which detracts from the ••pint ema
nated by the music serves no useful
purpose. In reality, it has no mean
ing or reason for having been cre
ated.
When asked just exactly how
the music suggests the type of
costumes to he used, Mrs. Opsvig
said that "1 just sit down with a
recording of the opera, and as the
music is played the spirit of the
music reveals what kind of cos
tumes are needed to catch that
spirit. It's a method any designer
has to learn." The success of this
attempt will be revealed when the
curtain goes up on opening night.
When a certain figure comes onto
the stage during the course of the
opera, few out;ide of the costuming
department will know the intimate
secret possessed by one of the mas
culine singers. It is doubtful if this
dastardly .secret wiil ever escape the
confines of the dressing room. It
seems that a recent extended vaca
tion combined with a huge supply
ol steaks has produced that middly
age spread which was not uncom
mon in the medieval days but which
unfortunately cannot bo used in this
production. To smooth things out,
the services of a large pink girdle
are required. Rumors are Hitting
all around Mem Aud as to who this
person might be.
The closing scene of the opera
provides the setting for the greatest
and perhaps the rhost exquisite dis
play of costume techniques used in
the production. This is the scene in
which all the members of the cast
are joined by a chorus of 58 to wit

ness the Devil and his disciples
wreak judgment, on the evils of Fal
staff. Naturally the Devil is one of
the centers of attraction and the
costume on this demon is extremely
realistic and helps to shame the fat
and wayward old knight.
Scenery designer Wendell Cole
has allowed a hit of fantasy to
rule in liis portrayal of the build
ings and other props. The house,
garden, and tavern scenes are
characterized by a strange and
i yet delightful sense of the days
of King Arthur and his Knights
of the Kound Table. As in the
I case of the costuming, the forest
| scenes provide the setting for the
best display of scenery design of
the production.
The curtain opens on a dark and
I misty forest with dim shadows mov
; ing in the background. This is the
spot where a madman had been
i hanged years before and whose
| j.',host was reported to revisit the
| scone of his death. The moss hang
ing from the trees and the vino
covered rocks are executed perfect
ly to create an atmosphere which
i at times truly spine-tingling. The
combination of the ominous music
and the forbidding forest would
serve to frighten any stranger in
that land, much less the timid Fal
i staff who is to meet the object of
his affections here on the stroke of
midnight.

Scenery designer Wendell Cole
has allowed a hit of fantasy to
rule in liis portrayal of the build

garden, and tavern scenes are
characterized by a strange and
i yet delightful sense of the days
of King Arthur and his Knights
of the Kound Table. As in the

the production.
The curtain opens on a dark and

covered rocks are executed perfect

i at times truly spine-tingling. The
combination of the ominous music
and the forbidding forest would

A subtle blend of medieval
patterns coupled with a large
array of modern colors marks
the efforts of the costume and
set designers for the Stanford
Playeis' and the Music Depart

row, Friday, and Saturday in
Memorial Auditorium at 8:15.
Tickets for the production may bo

According to Virginia Opsvig,
costume designer for the produc
tion, there has been an attempt to
capture the spirit of medieval days
by tiding basic diess designs of that
eia flavored with a great deal of
modern coloring.
The production calls tor a large
variety of costumes to depict many
different moods and personalities.
PagL boy ~ scullery maids, and local
barflies are only a lew of the va
riety of costumes demanded for a
successful production. Special at
tention has been paid to .see that
the costumes are in keeping with
the spirit the music imposes.
The l! "me followed in the de
signing ol the costumes was not
chosen in the traditional means.
There has been no attepint to cre
ate an exact replica of the late
11th century nor has there been
any effort toward authenticity.
The inspiration for a theme comes
not from any art hooks or peri
odicals concerning the era, hut
from the inspired pen of Oiuseppe
Verdi. The underlying basis for
the costume designs in this pro
duction comes from the music.
The opera is unique in its cos

tuming demands. The majority of
opera lovers do not come primarily
to see the efforts of the costume and
set designer, nor are they solely in
terested in the exactness ol a sing
er's portrayal of a character. They
come to hear the music. Any cos
tume, prop, or bit of stage make-up
which detracts from the ••pint ema
nated by the music serves no useful
purpose. In reality, it has no mean
ing or reason for having been cre
ated.
When asked just exactly how
the music suggests the type of
costumes to he used, Mrs. Opsvig
said that "1 just sit down with a
recording of the opera, and as the
music is played the spirit of the
music reveals what kind of cos
tumes are needed to catch that
spirit. It's a method any designer
has to learn." The success of this
attempt will be revealed when the
curtain goes up on opening night.
When a certain figure comes onto
the stage during the course of the
opera, few out;ide of the costuming
department will know the intimate
secret possessed by one of the mas
culine singers. It is doubtful if this
dastardly .secret wiil ever escape the
confines of the dressing room. It
seems that a recent extended vaca
tion combined with a huge supply
ol steaks has produced that middly
age spread which was not uncom
mon in the medieval days but which
unfortunately cannot bo used in this
production. To smooth things out,
the services of a large pink girdle
are required. Rumors are Hitting
all around Mem Aud as to who this
person might be.
The closing scene of the opera
provides the setting for the greatest
and perhaps the rhost exquisite dis
play of costume techniques used in
the production. This is the scene in
which all the members of the cast
are joined by a chorus of 58 to wit

ness the Devil and his disciples
wreak judgment, on the evils of Fal
staff. Naturally the Devil is one of
the centers of attraction and the
