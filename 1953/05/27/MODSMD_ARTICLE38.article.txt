# PUNTS AND PITCHES

### Pete Grothe 
They'U be playing football, basketball, and baseball around here next
year, just like they always have, but doggone if it's not going to be a
little hard to get used to seeing those teams without the services of some
boys who on June 14th receive their diplomas.
When it comes to football, we'll always remember Skip Crist, the husky
plunger from Palo Alto. Skip, the character of this year's team, was also
the spirit of it. He was a football player's football player who would bear
down a little harder when the going got tougher. If he hadn't intercepted
a pass in the USC game two years ago, Stanford wouldn't have gone to the
Rose Bowl.
We'll remember Ron Eadie. the most "guts-ball"' defensive end we've
over seen; Jim Vick, the gargantuan tackle; guard Len Mayrhofer, who,
when he wasn't hurt, gave line coach Joe Ruetz some of his happiest mo
ments; co-captain Al Kirkland, tackles John (Hippo) Brodcrick and Carter
Pyle; guard I tick Borda. ends Hob Ilocgh and Bill Storum, halvesßilly
Hcilltron, Dave Eld ridge, and Chuck Brazel. And those two hard-tackling
defensive backs, Joe St. (kmc and

Bobby Thompson.
In basketball, it'll be hard to for
get George Zanovich, the man who
put Delano on the map. It didn't par
ticularly matter whether George had
a good night or a mediocre night. It
was just a kind of joy watching a
basketballer who had the rare com
bination ol catlike agility and brute
strength. George's broad jump lay
ins were things of poetic beauty.
Dead-eye Paul Johnson was one of
the most Under-rated basketballers
in the conference and came to the
fore at the season's end.
Continuing the review of gradu
ating\ senior athletes, there's long
striding Bol) Simon, the tall, slat
like running machine, one of the five
best milers in the country; Howard
Hertz, the rnasive, low - headed
weightman, would have been break
ing world records in the shot if he

hud been throwing about ;i decade ago when 50-foot shot putters were
jare. Hertz, who has been edging 55 feet, can take second or third in the
nationals. <
Then there's Nason Fishback, who had difficultly making six feet in the
high jump until recently. In the Big Meet he cleared six-five. And don t
forget Marty Johnson, the smiling, all-purpose trackman, who would
have won a lot of hurdle races if a certain Bob Mathias hadn t been around.
Others who have seen their last services are broad jumper Fete McKay,
quarter miler Bill Friedrichs, discus man Chuck Renfro, sprinter Maury
Parsons, pole vaulter Dick Jacqua, high jumper Wes Frye, javelinist and
decathaloner Dick Holmes, and spearman Chuck Ilarlow. And finally, we'll
remember the Horatio Alger story of a senior high jumper who won the

intra mural track meet, was pressed
into varsity service, and tied for
third in the Big Meet, enough to get
his block. His name, John McCurdy.
Then there was boxer Bob Bal- !
docchi, tennisman Charlie Hfckox
and Bob Sibert, soccer player Harry i
Havilio, wrestlers Bob James and
Jack Ogelsby, swimmers Bert Holi- !
day and Ash Jones, diver John Mil
ler. and crewmen Ken Lewis and Joe
Sanborn. And a crew coach named j
Jim Fifer, who did such a magnifi
cent job of guiding the orphan oars
men this year.
Then there's a sport that is a par
ticular favoritee of ours that is going
to lose some men who are close to
indispensable. Jack Shepard, the best
college baseballer we've ever seen,
is a good bet to be playing in the
majors. Jack never stopped hustling
and usually could be depended on
to get a hit when the hit was needed,
intonation was as much a part of the

Ilis booming "Haaaa, shake it up!"
Sunken Diamond as the bleachers.

Then there was Chuck Essegian, the line-backer-outfielder who has j
more muscles in the right places than any other athlete on campus. We'll |
continually recall the time when poker-faced Charlie made history by
blasting two homers out of the Sunken Diamond and didn't even crack a j
Mona Lisa smile.
Dick Cole, who ranks as Stanford's best defensive outfielder since his |
brother Charlie; Bob Murphy, the confident right-hander from San Ma- j
teo with the deceptive curve and the blinding fast ball; and Hal Hennacy, !
about as fancy a fielding first baseman as you'll find in college ranks.

But there's one athlete whom we'll
particularly remember, and it doesn't
take too much guessing to know that
it's Bob Mathias. For Mathias is not '
only Stanford University's best ath
lete; he is also the world's best ath- !
lete. As long as athletics continue to j
exist and men continue to talk about
them, they'll bt» mentioning the name
of Bob Mathias in the same hushed '
tones visually reserved for Jim
Thorpe. Babe Ruth, and Red Grange.
Vhere are many Mathias feats that .
stand out indelibly in our mind, bu'i
the one most unforgettable was his j
victory in the '52 Olympics and the
method in which he achieved that
victory. He broke the Olympic and
world's record at Helsinki by regis- j
tering his three all-time best marks
in the last three events. He did this
despite the fact that he was dead j
tired and had a painful muscle pull !
in his leg.

day and Ash Jones, diver John Mil
ler. and crewmen Ken Lewis and Joe
Sanborn. And a crew coach named j
Jim Fifer, who did such a magnifi
cent job of guiding the orphan oars
men this year.
Then there's a sport that is a par
ticular favoritee of ours that is going
to lose some men who are close to
indispensable. Jack Shepard, the best
college baseballer we've ever seen,
is a good bet to be playing in the
majors. Jack never stopped hustling
and usually could be depended on
to get a hit when the hit was needed,
intonation was as much a part of the

Ilis booming "Haaaa, shake it up!"
Sunken Diamond as the bleachers.

Then there was Chuck Essegian, the line-backer-outfielder who has j
more muscles in the right places than any other athlete on campus. We'll |
continually recall the time when poker-faced Charlie made history by
blasting two homers out of the Sunken Diamond and didn't even crack a j
Mona Lisa smile.
Dick Cole, who ranks as Stanford's best defensive outfielder since his |
brother Charlie; Bob Murphy, the confident right-hander from San Ma- j
teo with the deceptive curve and the blinding fast ball; and Hal Hennacy, !
about as fancy a fielding first baseman as you'll find in college ranks.

But there's one athlete whom we'll
particularly remember, and it doesn't
take too much guessing to know that
it's Bob Mathias. For Mathias is not '
only Stanford University's best ath
lete; he is also the world's best ath- !
lete. As long as athletics continue to j
exist and men continue to talk about
them, they'll bt» mentioning the name
of Bob Mathias in the same hushed '
tones visually reserved for Jim
Thorpe. Babe Ruth, and Red Grange.
Vhere are many Mathias feats that .
stand out indelibly in our mind, bu'i
the one most unforgettable was his j
victory in the '52 Olympics and the
method in which he achieved that
victory. He broke the Olympic and
world's record at Helsinki by regis- j
tering his three all-time best marks
in the last three events. He did this
despite the fact that he was dead j
tired and had a painful muscle pull !
in his leg.

They'U be playing football, basketball, and baseball around here next
year, just like they always have, but doggone if it's not going to be a
little hard to get used to seeing those teams without the services of some
boys who on June 14th receive their diplomas.
When it comes to football, we'll always remember Skip Crist, the husky
plunger from Palo Alto. Skip, the character of this year's team, was also
the spirit of it. He was a football player's football player who would bear
down a little harder when the going got tougher. If he hadn't intercepted
a pass in the USC game two years ago, Stanford wouldn't have gone to the
Rose Bowl.
We'll remember Ron Eadie. the most "guts-ball"' defensive end we've
over seen; Jim Vick, the gargantuan tackle; guard Len Mayrhofer, who,
when he wasn't hurt, gave line coach Joe Ruetz some of his happiest mo
ments; co-captain Al Kirkland, tackles John (Hippo) Brodcrick and Carter
Pyle; guard I tick Borda. ends Hob Ilocgh and Bill Storum, halvesßilly
Hcilltron, Dave Eld ridge, and Chuck Brazel. And those two hard-tackling
defensive backs, Joe St. (kmc and

Bobby Thompson.
In basketball, it'll be hard to for
get George Zanovich, the man who
put Delano on the map. It didn't par
ticularly matter whether George had
a good night or a mediocre night. It
was just a kind of joy watching a
basketballer who had the rare com
bination ol catlike agility and brute
strength. George's broad jump lay
ins were things of poetic beauty.
Dead-eye Paul Johnson was one of
the most Under-rated basketballers
in the conference and came to the
fore at the season's end.
Continuing the review of gradu
ating\ senior athletes, there's long
striding Bol) Simon, the tall, slat
like running machine, one of the five
best milers in the country; Howard
Hertz, the rnasive, low - headed
weightman, would have been break
ing world records in the shot if he

hud been throwing about ;i decade ago when 50-foot shot putters were
jare. Hertz, who has been edging 55 feet, can take second or third in the
nationals. <
Then there's Nason Fishback, who had difficultly making six feet in the
high jump until recently. In the Big Meet he cleared six-five. And don t
forget Marty Johnson, the smiling, all-purpose trackman, who would
have won a lot of hurdle races if a certain Bob Mathias hadn t been around.
Others who have seen their last services are broad jumper Fete McKay,
quarter miler Bill Friedrichs, discus man Chuck Renfro, sprinter Maury
Parsons, pole vaulter Dick Jacqua, high jumper Wes Frye, javelinist and
decathaloner Dick Holmes, and spearman Chuck Ilarlow. And finally, we'll
remember the Horatio Alger story of a senior high jumper who won the

intra mural track meet, was pressed
into varsity service, and tied for
third in the Big Meet, enough to get
his block. His name, John McCurdy.
Then there was boxer Bob Bal- !
docchi, tennisman Charlie Hfckox
and Bob Sibert, soccer player Harry i
Havilio, wrestlers Bob James and
Jack Ogelsby, swimmers Bert Holi- !
day and Ash Jones, diver John Mil

over seen; Jim Vick, the gargantuan tackle; guard Len Mayrhofer, who,
when he wasn't hurt, gave line coach Joe Ruetz some of his happiest mo
ments; co-captain Al Kirkland, tackles John (Hippo) Brodcrick and Carter
Pyle; guard I tick Borda. ends Hob Ilocgh and Bill Storum, halvesßilly
Hcilltron, Dave Eld ridge, and Chuck Brazel. And those two hard-tackling
defensive backs, Joe St. (kmc and

Bobby Thompson.
In basketball, it'll be hard to for
get George Zanovich, the man who
put Delano on the map. It didn't par
ticularly matter whether George had
a good night or a mediocre night. It
was just a kind of joy watching a
basketballer who had the rare com
bination ol catlike agility and brute
strength. George's broad jump lay
ins were things of poetic beauty.
Dead-eye Paul Johnson was one of
the most Under-rated basketballers
in the conference and came to the
fore at the season's end.
Continuing the review of gradu
ating\ senior athletes, there's long
striding Bol) Simon, the tall, slat
like running machine, one of the five
best milers in the country; Howard
Hertz, the rnasive, low - headed
weightman, would have been break
ing world records in the shot if he

hud been throwing about ;i decade ago when 50-foot shot putters were
jare. Hertz, who has been edging 55 feet, can take second or third in the
nationals. <
Then there's Nason Fishback, who had difficultly making six feet in the
high jump until recently. In the Big Meet he cleared six-five. And don t
forget Marty Johnson, the smiling, all-purpose trackman, who would
have won a lot of hurdle races if a certain Bob Mathias hadn t been around.
Others who have seen their last services are broad jumper Fete McKay,
quarter miler Bill Friedrichs, discus man Chuck Renfro, sprinter Maury
Parsons, pole vaulter Dick Jacqua, high jumper Wes Frye, javelinist and
decathaloner Dick Holmes, and spearman Chuck Ilarlow. And finally, we'll
remember the Horatio Alger story of a senior high jumper who won the

intra mural track meet, was pressed
into varsity service, and tied for
third in the Big Meet, enough to get
his block. His name, John McCurdy.
Then there was boxer Bob Bal- !
docchi, tennisman Charlie Hfckox
and Bob Sibert, soccer player Harry i
Havilio, wrestlers Bob James and
Jack Ogelsby, swimmers Bert Holi- !
day and Ash Jones, diver John Mil
ler. and crewmen Ken Lewis and Joe
Sanborn. And a crew coach named j
Jim Fifer, who did such a magnifi
cent job of guiding the orphan oars
men this year.
Then there's a sport that is a par
ticular favoritee of ours that is going
to lose some men who are close to
indispensable. Jack Shepard, the best
college baseballer we've ever seen,
is a good bet to be playing in the
majors. Jack never stopped hustling
and usually could be depended on
to get a hit when the hit was needed,
intonation was as much a part of the

Ilis booming "Haaaa, shake it up!"
Sunken Diamond as the bleachers.

Then there was Chuck Essegian, the line-backer-outfielder who has j
more muscles in the right places than any other athlete on campus. We'll |
continually recall the time when poker-faced Charlie made history by
blasting two homers out of the Sunken Diamond and didn't even crack a j
Mona Lisa smile.
Dick Cole, who ranks as Stanford's best defensive outfielder since his |
brother Charlie; Bob Murphy, the confident right-hander from San Ma- j
teo with the deceptive curve and the blinding fast ball; and Hal Hennacy, !
about as fancy a fielding first baseman as you'll find in college ranks.

But there's one athlete whom we'll
particularly remember, and it doesn't
take too much guessing to know that
it's Bob Mathias. For Mathias is not '
only Stanford University's best ath
lete; he is also the world's best ath- !
lete. As long as athletics continue to j
exist and men continue to talk about
them, they'll bt» mentioning the name
of Bob Mathias in the same hushed '
tones visually reserved for Jim
Thorpe. Babe Ruth, and Red Grange.
Vhere are many Mathias feats that .
stand out indelibly in our mind, bu'i
the one most unforgettable was his j
victory in the '52 Olympics and the
method in which he achieved that
victory. He broke the Olympic and
world's record at Helsinki by regis- j
tering his three all-time best marks
in the last three events. He did this
despite the fact that he was dead j
tired and had a painful muscle pull !
in his leg.

They'U be playing football, basketball, and baseball around here next
year, just like they always have, but doggone if it's not going to be a
little hard to get used to seeing those teams without the services of some
boys who on June 14th receive their diplomas.
When it comes to football, we'll always remember Skip Crist, the husky
plunger from Palo Alto. Skip, the character of this year's team, was also
the spirit of it. He was a football player's football player who would bear
down a little harder when the going got tougher. If he hadn't intercepted
a pass in the USC game two years ago, Stanford wouldn't have gone to the
Rose Bowl.
We'll remember Ron Eadie. the most "guts-ball"' defensive end we've
