# Comic Capers Fill Chappie
## 
### 
It's here today ready to expose the
students of. Stanford to the sordid
side of life.
The Chaparral's annual comic
book issue is on the stands, featuring
the renouncd funnies: "Dick Racy,"
, "The Jackass Twins," "Don a 1 d
| Goose," "Mickey Spleen," Flush
Gordo," and "Racy Struggles."
The Old Boy can now lean back
and relax, as all efforts to suppress
j the forthcoming "shocking" edition
have been thwarted. He is rather
doubtful as to his future though,
jas he believes that the Dean will
j not fully approve of his shocking cx
jpose.
The Chaparral is selling subscrip
j lions for next year's issues at the
Cellar tomorrow and Friday from 8-
j 2:30. The yearly subscription rate
is $2.50. This is a special sale for
| graduates who will not return to
! Stanford in the fall.
