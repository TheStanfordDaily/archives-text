## Paul Reynaud's Appeal Fails 
### 
PARIS, Thursday, May 28
(UP) Paul Reynaud, veteran
right-wing independent, failed
today to win confirmation as
France's 19th post-war premier.
Rcynaud had appealed to the Na
tional Assembly to name him prc
micr on a program of constitutioanl
reform which would have adopted
British governmental procedure in
an attempt to end France's long se
ries of unstable governments.
His chances of confirmation were
doomed shortly before the voting
when the Popular Republicans
failed to hind their members to sup
port him, and the former followers
of Cien. Charles de Gaulle decided
to split 75 votes.
The 74-year-old former premier's
speech was so hard-hitting that even
his sternest critics—the Socialists
and the Communists—described it
as "sensational."
