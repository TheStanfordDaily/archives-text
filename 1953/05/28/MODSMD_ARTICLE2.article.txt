# Reorganization
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 27 â€” The
Senate today approved President
Eisenhower's Agriculture Depart
ment reorganization plan over Dem
ocratic protests that it. would give
Secretary Ezra T. Benson "blank
cheek" powers to change farm poli
cies.
The roll call was 10 to 2D in favor
of the plan.
Technically, the Senate voted to
reject a resolution by Sen. Richard
B. Russell (D., Ga.) to reject the
proposal. The reorganization plan
will go into effect. at midnight June
unless vetoed by 218 House mem
bers. Democrats concede they have
little hope of defeating it in the
lower chamber.
The plan would give Benson
sweeping authority to reorganize
about half of the agencies in his
sprawling department. He* already
holds such powers over the rest. The
plan would not affect the Farm
Credit Corporation or the Commod
ity Credit Corporation.
