# Curtain Rises Tonight on 'Falstaff'
## 
### JERRY SIMPSON 
The curtain will rise in Mem
Aud tonight at 8:15 on one of the
rare performances of Verdi's
"Falstaff," a work most compa
nies avoid because of the com
plexity of the score and the
large number of ensembles.
'J ho Stanford Players say that. they
have designed the costumes for tJio
production in accordance with the
spirit of the music.
They haven't made any at
tempt at authenticity, hilt jusl the
slightest hints of the medieval
have heen incorporated.
I lie setting of the final scene
merits mention shrouds of mist, will
slither through moss-hung trees in
a murky forest as eerie strains of
music chill the marrow of the bones.
"Falstaff" was Guiseppi Verdi's
last opera and is considered one of
his greatest operas as well as one of
the greatest of all comic operas. It
was com poser I in thr> modern manner
with a continuous flow of melodies,
not separated arias and duets.
A ten-voice fugue with chorus,
one of the most difficult numbers in
the work, climaxes the opera. The
large number of ensembles of six or
more voices contribute to the com
plexity of the source.
For this reason the work is
finely performed, even though it
is generally considered to he one
of the finest comedy works in the
entire operatic repertory.
