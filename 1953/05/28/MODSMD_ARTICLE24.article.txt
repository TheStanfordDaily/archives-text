### 
By HADLEY ROFF, Associate Editor, The Daily
I he Stanford Daily's ailing finances received significant moral
support last night when Excom, in its final meeting of the yea/,
wont on record as favoring about a $5,000 increase in funds paid,
the paper out of student fees each year.
The increase, accoiding to the Excom recommendation, wjll bo

tfy a reduction in the
amount paid from fees to the Stan -
ford Athletic Board.
Rx.com recommended the change
after after hearing a report on the
, Daily's financial situation given by
Walt Menninger, a former manag
ing editor and a current editorial
assistant.
Menninger reported that the Daily
stands to conic out between $3,000
and $5,000 in the hole this year.
He blamed the delicit on vi
raling production cost;, which
have almost doubled within th<-
past five years.
He pointed out that the Daily r.
currently working under i
arrangement that was first ap ■
proved during the depression year
of J932. That arrangement callcd
for the payment of 75 cents to the
Daily from each student'., tuition
each quarter.
In the past few years, he said,
<he paper has received some extra
help from funds diverted from *h<
SAB. These funds were not made
j available this year, he advised
Menninger, harked bv Student
j Manager Steve Horn, asked <no<
an extra 25 cents be added to the
75 cents already paid by students
each quarter, thus adding about
$5,000 to the Daily funds annually
Both Menninger and Horn
claimed that the extra subsidy wns
the only solution to the financial
difficulty.
Exc o *m unanimously approved
Menninger's recommendation. ir,
will now be forwarded to the Presi •
dent's office for further study and
final action.
In other business, a few die-hard::
revived the faSA issue, moving that.
Stanford should further study th>*
possibility of joining the association.
After almost an hour and a half of
debate, Excom members hit on .»
compromise: that Stahford will end
an observer to the NSA Congress to
be held this summer. Student Body
President-elect Don Lozabnick w <3
I named as the observer.
