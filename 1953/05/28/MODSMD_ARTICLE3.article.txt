HANOI, Indochina — The French
blow up eight, of their own forts to
withdraw today to new lines south
of here, and military officials said
other withdrawals may follow.
A French high command spokes
man said the destruction and evac
uation of eight, steel-and-concrete
bastions at Yen Vi, 30 miles south
of here, was completed early today
"without enemy pressure."
High French officials said it was
quite possible other withdrawals
might be undertaken shortly to
smooth out jutting salients and
"tighten" Hanoi delta defenses
against an expected mass onslaught
by Communist Victminh armies.
