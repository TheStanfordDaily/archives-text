## On Choosing ASSU Scholars 
### 
According to last* Tuesday's Daily the ASSU For
eign Scholarship Committee has announced the names
of the exchange students from abroad who will
attend Stanford during the next academic year.
For the student who is not versed in the art of
"rational and suitable selection," the decision of the
F. S. Committee to bring eight students from Europe
(one Swiss, one Greek, one Italian, one Danish, one
Austrian, and three Germans) and one from the
Philippines seems perplexing. It is nut a coincidence
that this committee- j »-assumedly representing the
student body of this University—should have invited
for the past few years a high proportion of students
from northern European countries and especially
from Germany. 'Why are students from Latin Ameri
ca and Africa excluded from this program?
I have confined myself before only to "viva-voce"

criticisms of this policy and have invariably received i
palliatives for answers. May I inform the committee
in charge of the selection that this letter does not
reflect merely an isolated opinion; in fact, I have
found that many students ignore the reasons de
termining this apparently discriminatory attitude and
often attribute to duplicity the committee's criteria
of preferred foreign students. In order that the
notion of the committee's bias could be dispelled,
it is necessary that an illuminating explanation be
given.
The F. S. Committee should be aware that a legion
of deserving students from the other half of this |
continent as well as from Africa and Asia are eager
to study in the U.S. I suggest that in the future these !
students be seriously considered in the committee's j
choice.
