### BARBIE TUERK 
UNFAIR COMPETITION—A stu
dent at the University of Utah, com
plaining because Utah's football
teams haven't been winning, cited
the example of a friend of his who
he said was now going to Stanford
instead of Utah, because Stanford's
football scholarship offered him
more security.
"Stanford knew he had possibili
ties and offered him a four-year
contract, which paid his tuition re
gardless of injury or failure to
make the team," he said, add : .ng
hopefully, "Qui- school could have
done the same thing and probably
got the student."

EX-RED REPRIMANDED — Pro
fessor Wendell H. Furry, one of the
three Harvard professors who re
fused to discuss Communist affilia
tions before Congressional investi
gating committees, was charged
with "grave misconduct" by the
Harvard Corporation, the school's
administrative body, last .week.
Furry, who left the Communist
party in 1950, was placed on three
years' probation for participating in
"activities that,were secret or de
ceptive," but was not discharged.
Two other Harvard teachers who
refused to answer the investigators
were found "not guilty of grave
misconduct ... on the information
we now have."

AFTER THE IBM—Cal's got still
another machine in mind. This time
they want to get voting machines
from San Francisco for next year's
student - body elections. Students
were up until 4:45 a.m. counting
ballots for last week's elections, and
more than a few thought that was

DISCRIMINATION TO BE BAN
NED— Pennsylvania and Columbia
Universities have started campaigns
to rid their campuses of fraternities
with discriminatory clauses.
Columbia students voted 2 to 1
at a recent referendum to force any

houses which still have discrimina
tory clauses by 1960 off the campus.
Pennsylvania set up a subcommit
| tee to investigate discriminatory
| clauses. Its purpose, said "The
Pennsylvanian," is to "help the fra
i ternities at Penn who want to move
| for the change at their national
| conventions this summer."

EX-RED REPRIMANDED — Pro
fessor Wendell H. Furry, one of the
three Harvard professors who re
fused to discuss Communist affilia
tions before Congressional investi
gating committees, was charged
with "grave misconduct" by the
Harvard Corporation, the school's
administrative body, last .week.
Furry, who left the Communist
party in 1950, was placed on three
years' probation for participating in
"activities that,were secret or de
ceptive," but was not discharged.
Two other Harvard teachers who
refused to answer the investigators
were found "not guilty of grave
misconduct ... on the information
we now have."

DISCRIMINATION TO BE BAN
NED— Pennsylvania and Columbia
Universities have started campaigns
to rid their campuses of fraternities
with discriminatory clauses.
Columbia students voted 2 to 1
at a recent referendum to force any

houses which still have discrimina
tory clauses by 1960 off the campus.
Pennsylvania set up a subcommit
| tee to investigate discriminatory
| clauses. Its purpose, said "The
Pennsylvanian," is to "help the fra
i ternities at Penn who want to move
| for the change at their national
| conventions this summer."
