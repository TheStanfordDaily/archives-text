# ATHLETE OF WEEK
## Who Else but Bob? 
### 
For the final athlete of the week
selection of the year, who could be
more fitting than Bob Mathias, who
closes out a fabulous Stanford ath
letic career Saturday in the PCC
finals.
Technically* Mathias wins for
scoring 12 points in last Saturday's
Big Meet. He grabbed off a fir-t in
the discus and low hurdles, a third
in the shot, and a disappointing
third in the high hurdles. Actually,
the Daily realized that the athlete
ol the week award would be worth
less if it didn't salute Stanford's
greatest athlete.
Looking back over his athletic ca
reer which stretches over the past
eight years, Mathias says it's been
well worth it. "I've had a lot of
fun, seen a lot of places, and met
a lot of nice people. 1 wouldn't
trade a minute of it."
He names his two decathlon vic
tories at the Olympics as far and
away his most memorable experi
ences. "Football is a lot of fun, but
I've never seen anything in it that
could compare to the thrill of the
Olympic Games."
On June 17, Mathias will marry
Melba Wiser. After school, he will
serve a hitch in the Marine Corps.
He may do a little running in the
Corps and might even compete in
the 19. r )() Olympics, but he is definite
in his plans to give up football.
Coach Jack Weiershauser in sum

ming up Mathias's chances next
Saturday said, "He'll run the hur
dles in : 14.2 or : 14.3; he'll throw
the di-cus over 160 feet; he'll put
the shot over 50 feet; and he'll run
the lows in under :24. Now face it.

he will probably lose in all these
events, but what other athlete in
the world could do that well in
these events?"
The soft-spoken coach had plenty
of praise lor Mathias. "It's incred
ible that n man who has won the
Sullivan Award, two Olympic med
als, and every honor that can be
fall an athlete can siill be as unas
suming and modest as Bob.â€”M. H.
