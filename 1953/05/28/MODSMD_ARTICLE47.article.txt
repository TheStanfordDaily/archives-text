# Golfers Seek NCAA Title
## 
### ELMORE SEEDS 
Stanford's varsity golfers, South
ern Division champs, are busy pre
paring for the NCAA finals, June 16
to 21, on the Broadmoor course,
Coolrado Springs, Colorado.
"Stanford will definitely be in
contention. Our first four men are
as good as any in the country," said
Couch Bud Finger, himself a mem
ber of two Stanford NCAA winners.
However Finger, who has coached
Stanford to three Southern Division
crowns in lour years, cautioned,
"North Texas State and Louisiana
State will be heavy favorites again
this year. Both teams have six out
standing men."
In NCAA play, team totals con
sist of the four best scores out of
.six entrants front each school.
Therefore, both North Texas and
I-SU, with such stars as Joe Con
rad, ex-Texas Open champ; Eddie
Mevrins, 1951 National JC Jun
ior winner; Tommy Morrow, Lou
isiana State Amateur champ; and
(Jay Brewer, will lie shoo-ins un
less Stanford's fearsome foursome
all come through together.
The top four for the Cards, Fred
Brown, Art Schroeder, Grant
Spaeth, and Warren Dailey, are all
veterans of last year's NCAA play

at Purdue, Indiana. They have been
steady peformers for the Indians all
year, with Schroeder the PCC
champion, and the entire bunch
PCC semi-finalists. Although they
don't boast the reputation or the
titles of some of the Southern pow
erhouse agghegations, they are ea
sily capable of upsetting the apple
cart.
There is also a chance that the
Card five and six men will get hot.
Slu ledbetter, although inexpe
rienced at the season's outset, has
improved steadily and will defi
nitely he a possible come-through
performer (a necessity in case one
of the first four fades) at the
number five positions.

Three golfers are fighting it out
I for the number six berth, Bob Sims,
Bob Blackburn, and Ken Schoen
feld. Sims and Blackburn have al-

ternated at the number .six spot this
year while Schoenfeld has never
participated in varsity competition.
The Broadmoor course, at the
foot of Pike's Peak. i~ not excep
tionally long or difficult. The
greens, however, are considered
by most to Ie as trick> as tliey
come.
