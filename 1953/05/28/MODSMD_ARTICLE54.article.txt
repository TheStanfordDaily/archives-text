# Crew Preps for Syracuse
## 
### JIM MADISON 
Jim Fifer's indomitable crew,
alive and kicking despite , two suc
cessive losses to Cal, have drawn
lane number six, between the Bears
and favored Navy, in the June 20
Intercollegiate Rowing champion
ships.
Washington, which will probably
be ranked as number two choice
behind the defending champion
Sailors, will row in lane 10 on Syra
cuse's Lake Onondaga.
Filer yesterday, a bit fazed at his
men being assigned to row next to
their big competition, was visibly
relieved by the fact that Syracuse
University was in lane eight, be
yond Navy.
''At least we will l>e near some
body we ought to he ahead of,"
he said.
Fifer also spoke optimistically of
the crew's chances in the nationals,
even after two defeats by the Bears.
"We ought* to finish io the first
half of what should he a really
good race," he said.

| The Card boating is in a state of
| flux at the present, and Filer will
not announce until Sunday the men
who will (ly east June 9 in time to
race at Wisconsin before the Syra
j cuse regatta.
The recently announced Budget*
rucc vvili he held June 13 at a dis
tance of 1 1 1 miles. Wisconsin is
sharing the extra expense of the
Stanford side-trip.
The extra race, which will be the
I fir.it in a projected annual series,
will round out the fullest racing
schedule the Cards have attempted
!-ince their independent organization
| was started.
Before the big race at Syracuse,
the Cards will take delivery on a
brand-new single-skin Pocock shell.
The single - skin shell is lighter
and faster than the d&uble - skin
boats now in the Indian fleet, and
is used for racing by all the other
j big-time crew schools.
Filer is not certain yet on his
replacement as next year's crew

coach. The husky engineering
senior will go on active duty
with the Navy in June.
"Don Griffin, a former Cornell
varsity oar, is a graduate student in
engineering mechanics here, and
he'll probably be able to help. We're
aslo looking for a couple of good
Berkeley oarsmen to come to Biz
School here," Filer said.


ROW, ROW, ROW YOUR BOAT -The Card crew is stepping up their practice in preparation
for the Nationals June 22 at Syracuse. The first boat has not been officially named but it might
line up something like this: Pete Paup, coxswain, kneeling, (1. to r.) Stan Lewis, Morgan San
born, Jerry Thayer, Phil West, Ken Lewis, Jerry Thursby, Dixon Smith, and Bill Finlay.

senior will go on active duty
with the Navy in June.
"Don Griffin, a former Cornell
varsity oar, is a graduate student in
engineering mechanics here, and
he'll probably be able to help. We're
aslo looking for a couple of good
Berkeley oarsmen to come to Biz
School here," Filer said.


ROW, ROW, ROW YOUR BOAT -The Card crew is stepping up their practice in preparation
for the Nationals June 22 at Syracuse. The first boat has not been officially named but it might
line up something like this: Pete Paup, coxswain, kneeling, (1. to r.) Stan Lewis, Morgan San
born, Jerry Thayer, Phil West, Ken Lewis, Jerry Thursby, Dixon Smith, and Bill Finlay.
Jim Fifer's indomitable crew,
alive and kicking despite , two suc
cessive losses to Cal, have drawn
lane number six, between the Bears
and favored Navy, in the June 20
Intercollegiate Rowing champion
ships.
Washington, which will probably
be ranked as number two choice
behind the defending champion
Sailors, will row in lane 10 on Syra
cuse's Lake Onondaga.
Filer yesterday, a bit fazed at his
men being assigned to row next to
their big competition, was visibly
relieved by the fact that Syracuse
University was in lane eight, be
yond Navy.
''At least we will l>e near some
body we ought to he ahead of,"
he said.
Fifer also spoke optimistically of
the crew's chances in the nationals,
even after two defeats by the Bears.
"We ought* to finish io the first
half of what should he a really
good race," he said.

| The Card boating is in a state of
| flux at the present, and Filer will
not announce until Sunday the men
who will (ly east June 9 in time to
race at Wisconsin before the Syra
j cuse regatta.
The recently announced Budget*
rucc vvili he held June 13 at a dis
tance of 1 1 1 miles. Wisconsin is
sharing the extra expense of the
Stanford side-trip.
The extra race, which will be the
I fir.it in a projected annual series,
will round out the fullest racing
schedule the Cards have attempted
!-ince their independent organization
| was started.
Before the big race at Syracuse,
the Cards will take delivery on a
brand-new single-skin Pocock shell.
The single - skin shell is lighter
and faster than the d&uble - skin
boats now in the Indian fleet, and
is used for racing by all the other
j big-time crew schools.
Filer is not certain yet on his
replacement as next year's crew

coach. The husky engineering
senior will go on active duty
with the Navy in June.

varsity oar, is a graduate student in
