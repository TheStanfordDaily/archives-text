Tho body of a San Jose State assistant professor who apparently

quarter was found in a carbon monoxide filled car on Coast High
way near Pescadero early yesterday afternoon.

♦•that the victim, Carleton J. Smythe,
44, apparently killed himself Sun
day night by piping gas fumes into
his parked car.
Smythe, who was last, seen at a
, party in San Jose Saturday nigh),
| left three suicide notes.
One of the notes, addressed to Dr.
Dwight Bental, head of the jour
j nalism department at San Jose State,
j referred to Smythe's violation of
! the Stanford honor code during
finals week last winter quarter. The
note read, in part:
"I disgraced you and San Jose
State by being charged with an
honor code violation in a final ex
amination in statistics at Stan
ford and then made matters worse
I by asking for a hearing.
"I disbarred myself from teach
ing. I lost the power to make right
decisions long ago. I should never
have been born. . . . My life is a
complete fraud. I probably am
| criminally insane."
The hearing mentioned by Smythe
j was a trial by the Council for Stu
! dent Control, held on May 12.
Smythe was found guilty by the
Council after admitting lie had
copied from other students' papers
during a final in Statistics (>0.
The Council suspended Smythe
from school for spring and summer
quarters and ordered a "no record"
notation to be placed on his of
ficial transcript.
Council members reported last
night that Smythe had asked for
j the trial because be wanted to re
turn to Stanford for summer work.
At the trial he admitted his guilt
and blamed his cheating on the
lack of a math background nec
essary for the course.
He said at the trial that lie had
"lost all confidence and foil too old
to compete with college students."
He also had said at the trial that
he was teaching a heavy load at
San Jose in addition to his nine
units of courses at Stanford, and
that he went "beserk' when he was
cheating.
Jack Butler, head of Men's Coun
cil atid chairman of the group that
tried Smythe, said last night that
Smythe had phoned him on the
Wednesday night following the trial.
Butler reported that Smythe was
worried that word of the action
might get to San Jose State.
"I assured him that everything
bad been kept secret," Butler
said, "lie admitted over the phone
that be bad bad a fair trial, and
after a half hour conversation
; seemed satisfied that no one would
hear about the violation."
Smythe, a resident of San Jose,
had taught at San Jose State since
1951 as a temporary assistant pro
fessor of journalism. He had re
ceived his B.A. in journalism at Co
lumbia University in 1931, and his
M.S. in journalism at the Universi
ty of Illinois in 1951.
At the time of his admission to
Stanford in winter quarter, he listed
his next of kin as his mother, Mrs.
H. Smythe, 325 Hamilton, Palo Alto.
