# Cards May Drop Out Of NCAA Play-Off
## WSC, Cal to Fight Cards for Second 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford will play the proud
hosts to eight other PCC track
teams, which will bring some of
the top trackmen in the world to
Stanford's Big Brown Bowl.
The trials begin at 4 p.m. today
and the finals at 1:30 tomorrow.
Stanford students will have a
chance to .see USC's Parry O'Brien,
the greatest shot putter the world
has ever known; discus thrower Sim
Iness, who, like team-mate O'Brien,
was an Olympic champion; long
Jack Davis, another Trojan who
missed by a hair in taking first in the
hurdles in the Olympics.
Sam Adams, the best weightman
in California history, who lias thrown
the javelin farther than any col
legian in the country this year; Bob
Gary, a 0.7 sprinter from Washing
ton State; Denny Meyer, a 0:17.7
two-milcr from Washington; Ernie
Shelton of USC and Howard Mc-
Cants of Washington State, two six
seven high jumpers; UCLA'S Len
Eilcrs, who has vaulted 14 feet, one
and seven-eighths inches; and USC's
Verle Sorgen who has leapt through
24 feet Wa inches of air before hit- i
ting the ground.
Rut for Stanford track fans,
there'll be something more im
portant tomorrow than seeing these
great athletes compete.
For tomorrow marks the last, day
that Bob Mathias will compete.
He'll closc out a career that has
been the real meaning of that over
worked word "great." For Mathias
has been great in every way. He
has been a great competitor, a great
winner, a great, team man, and a
great sportsman.
Daily crystal ball gazer Dick
Maltzman has picked the meet the
following way: USC, 62Va points;
Stanford, 43%; Cal, 36; WSC, 28;
UCLA, 24; OSC, 10%; Washington,
8 1 /2\ Idaho, 7; Oregon, 5.
The closest events should be the
100 yard dash, the two mile, and the
javelin. The 100 will feature Gary,
Rod Richards (UCLA), Guy Black
burn (Cal), Joe Graffio (USC), and
Keith Brownsberger (Stanford), any

one of whom could win.
The two mile will pit Meyer, WSC's
A 1 Fisher, and the Farm's Bob Reed
against each other.
Adams and Stanford's Leo Long,
the two best spear-heavers in the
country, will give a preview of the
nationals. And hot on their tails
will he Stanford's Boh Kimball
and Cal's Dick Righter.
But the attention still will be fo
cused on a doctor's son from Tulare,
whose Stanford 49 track jersey will
be seen tomoiTOw for the last time.


UNDERRATED —Jerry Wood has been finishing second in the
hurdles to Bob Mathias so much this year, fans forget he is one
of the five or six best timber-toppers in the nation. Jerry and
his mates will attempt to outpoint a star-studded USC and rough
Cal crew this afternoon and tomorrow in the annual PCC track
meet in Stanford Stadium. —Daily photo by Don Cheu

UNDERRATED —Jerry Wood has been finishing second in the
hurdles to Bob Mathias so much this year, fans forget he is one
of the five or six best timber-toppers in the nation. Jerry and
his mates will attempt to outpoint a star-studded USC and rough
Cal crew this afternoon and tomorrow in the annual PCC track
meet in Stanford Stadium. —Daily photo by Don Cheu
Stanford will play the proud
hosts to eight other PCC track
teams, which will bring some of
the top trackmen in the world to
Stanford's Big Brown Bowl.
The trials begin at 4 p.m. today
and the finals at 1:30 tomorrow.
Stanford students will have a
chance to .see USC's Parry O'Brien,
the greatest shot putter the world
has ever known; discus thrower Sim
Iness, who, like team-mate O'Brien,
was an Olympic champion; long
Jack Davis, another Trojan who
missed by a hair in taking first in the
hurdles in the Olympics.
Sam Adams, the best weightman
in California history, who lias thrown
the javelin farther than any col
legian in the country this year; Bob
Gary, a 0.7 sprinter from Washing
ton State; Denny Meyer, a 0:17.7
two-milcr from Washington; Ernie
Shelton of USC and Howard Mc-
Cants of Washington State, two six
seven high jumpers; UCLA'S Len
Eilcrs, who has vaulted 14 feet, one
and seven-eighths inches; and USC's
Verle Sorgen who has leapt through
24 feet Wa inches of air before hit- i
ting the ground.
Rut for Stanford track fans,
there'll be something more im
portant tomorrow than seeing these
great athletes compete.
For tomorrow marks the last, day
that Bob Mathias will compete.
He'll closc out a career that has
been the real meaning of that over
worked word "great." For Mathias
has been great in every way. He
has been a great competitor, a great
winner, a great, team man, and a
great sportsman.
Daily crystal ball gazer Dick
Maltzman has picked the meet the
following way: USC, 62Va points;
Stanford, 43%; Cal, 36; WSC, 28;
UCLA, 24; OSC, 10%; Washington,
8 1 /2\ Idaho, 7; Oregon, 5.
The closest events should be the
100 yard dash, the two mile, and the
javelin. The 100 will feature Gary,
Rod Richards (UCLA), Guy Black
burn (Cal), Joe Graffio (USC), and
Keith Brownsberger (Stanford), any

one of whom could win.
The two mile will pit Meyer, WSC's
A 1 Fisher, and the Farm's Bob Reed
against each other.
Adams and Stanford's Leo Long,
the two best spear-heavers in the
country, will give a preview of the
nationals. And hot on their tails
will he Stanford's Boh Kimball
and Cal's Dick Righter.
But the attention still will be fo
cused on a doctor's son from Tulare,
whose Stanford 49 track jersey will
be seen tomoiTOw for the last time.
