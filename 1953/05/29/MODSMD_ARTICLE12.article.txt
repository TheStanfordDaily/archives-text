### MIKE HUDSON Daily Sports Editor 
Stanford's baseball team,
I still uncertain as to â€¢ whether
J they will be able to represent
the West in the NCAA play-off,
will meet Oregon today at 3:15
and tomorrow at 1 to decide the
PCC champion.
If the teams split the first two
games, they will turn Saturday's
tilt, into a double-header.
The NCAA committee, in a de
pressing move, has established an
! other concurrent play-off between
I San Diego State, USC, and Seattle,
j They have further scheduled the
' PCC champ vs. this champ to be
I played June 5 and (5, during finals
J week.
A! Masters and chairman of the
| finals schedule committee William
i Bark have announced that Stanford
j will have to withdraw if they are
forced to play ofT on these days, al
though they could play next Mon
day and Tuesday.
Bark has written a letter lodging
an official protest against the short
sighted action of the NCAA com
mittee of three.
Regardless of what happens next
week, the Cards must still beat
Oregon this weekend. Oregon has
been corning from behind to win
low - scoring ball games all year.
Fortunately for the Cards, they are
much worse on the road than at
home.
Heart of the Oregon team is a
sophomore quartet of steady hurlers
led by Norm Forbes and Stan Dmo
chowski. They are backed by a near
professional-fielding infield. Lead
ing the Ducks' somewhat anemic
hitting attack are Earl Averill Jr.,
son of a truly great major leaguer,
and George Shaw, of the Stanford
Shaws, at catcher and shortstop re
spectively.

To no one's surprise, Coach Everett

Dean has nominated Bob Murphy
to hurl today's opener with hard
luck Phil Page ready for tomorrow's
conteest.
The best news of all for Card fans
is that Jack Shepard's ankle has
almost completely healed and the big
catcher should be at his best this
weekend.
In fact the Cards appear ready to
beat Oregon and the team feels that
the only thing that can keep them
from Omaha on June 11 is the NCAA
ruling committee.
