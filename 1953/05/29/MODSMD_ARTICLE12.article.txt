Stanford's baseball team,
I still uncertain as to • whether
J they will be able to represent
the West in the NCAA play-off,
will meet Oregon today at 3:15
and tomorrow at 1 to decide the
PCC champion.
If the teams split the first two
games, they will turn Saturday's
tilt, into a double-header.
The NCAA committee, in a de
pressing move, has established an
! other concurrent play-off between
I San Diego State, USC, and Seattle,

' PCC champ vs. this champ to be
I played June 5 and (5, during finals
J week.
A! Masters and chairman of the
| finals schedule committee William
i Bark have announced that Stanford
j will have to withdraw if they are
forced to play ofT on these days, al
though they could play next Mon

Fortunately for the Cards, they are
much worse on the road than at
home.
