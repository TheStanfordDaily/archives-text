# Rising Costs, Fixed Income Force Daily into Deficit
## 
### WALT MENNINGER Editorial Assistant, The Daily 
(Editor's note: At Wednesday's Kxcom meeting, The Stanford Daily
revealed that the paper is heading for a considerable deficit this year.
To explain this situation to the student body, Daily Business Manager
Connie Lib hey and ASSU Student Manager Steve Horn have authorized
the following report.)

The Stanford Daily is currently in dire financial straits. Work
ing on a total budget of approximately $50,000 a year, the paper
is faced now with the prospect of a $3,000 to $5,000 deficit, nearly
ten per cent of the operating costs.
It its debts continue at present expectations, with no increase in

revenue, the Stanford Daily will not/*
last more than four years. (There is
sufficient reserve to maintain the
paper that long.) In other words,
with no change, Stanford would be
without, a student newspaper five
years from now.
Hising prices, especially printing
costs, since World War II have far
outdistanced the Daily income which
comes primarily from display ad

vcrtising and student fees.
The income from display ad
vertising is now al a peak since
the advertising rates were in
creased just two years ago and
are now at the optimum rate for
the paper. Another increase can
not be made since (1) circulation,
upon which advertising is based,
is decreasing with decreasing en
rollment; and (2) a further in
crease in rates would price the
Daily out of the advertising mar
ket.
The income from student fees is
set. at a fixed figure by the ASSU
constitution at 7. r » cents per student
per quarter. This rate was set in
in 1932 and has not been increased
since. With the post-war enroll
ment doubling, this income was ac
cordingly doubled; however, the
costs of putting out the paper have
overtaken this increase and gone
beyond it. Meanwhile, as the en
rollment declines, this fixed income
declines.
The financial squeeze was first
felt by the Daily in 1 !).">(), and at
that time ASSU Kxcom foresaw
the consequences. Therefore, they
recommended a subsidy to the
paper of 2.1 cents per student per
niiarter to be taken from the
Women's Clubhouse and the Un
ion Board of (Governors, which
receive a dollar per student per
quarter from women and men
students respectively.
This, in essence, meant that the
Daily would receive one dollar per
student per quarter, and this sub
sidy added approximately $5,000 to
the paper's income from student
fees. (That is, averaging about 6,800
