# Rising Costs, Fixed Income Force Daily into Deficit
## 
### WALT MENNINGER Editorial Assistant, The Daily 
(Editor's note: At Wednesday's Kxcom meeting, The Stanford Daily
revealed that the paper is heading for a considerable deficit this year.
To explain this situation to the student body, Daily Business Manager
Connie Lib hey and ASSU Student Manager Steve Horn have authorized
the following report.)

The Stanford Daily is currently in dire financial straits. Work
ing on a total budget of approximately $50,000 a year, the paper
is faced now with the prospect of a $3,000 to $5,000 deficit, nearly
ten per cent of the operating costs.
It its debts continue at present expectations, with no increase in

revenue, the Stanford Daily will not/*
last more than four years. (There is
sufficient reserve to maintain the
paper that long.) In other words,
with no change, Stanford would be
without, a student newspaper five
years from now.
Hising prices, especially printing
costs, since World War II have far
outdistanced the Daily income which
comes primarily from display ad

vcrtising and student fees.
The income from display ad
vertising is now al a peak since
the advertising rates were in
creased just two years ago and
are now at the optimum rate for
the paper. Another increase can
not be made since (1) circulation,
upon which advertising is based,
is decreasing with decreasing en
rollment; and (2) a further in
crease in rates would price the
Daily out of the advertising mar
ket.
The income from student fees is
set. at a fixed figure by the ASSU
constitution at 7. r » cents per student
per quarter. This rate was set in
in 1932 and has not been increased
since. With the post-war enroll
ment doubling, this income was ac
cordingly doubled; however, the
costs of putting out the paper have
overtaken this increase and gone
beyond it. Meanwhile, as the en
rollment declines, this fixed income
declines.
The financial squeeze was first
felt by the Daily in 1 !).">(), and at
that time ASSU Kxcom foresaw
the consequences. Therefore, they
recommended a subsidy to the
paper of 2.1 cents per student per
niiarter to be taken from the
Women's Clubhouse and the Un
ion Board of (Governors, which
receive a dollar per student per
quarter from women and men
students respectively.
This, in essence, meant that the
Daily would receive one dollar per
student per quarter, and this sub
sidy added approximately $5,000 to
the paper's income from student
fees. (That is, averaging about 6,800
students a quarter, totaling some
20,000 students in three quarters,
with the Daily receiving 25 cents
from each student, the Daily re
ceive:! an additional $5,000.)
Willi (his subsidy the Daily was
able to come out in the black in
1950-51, and was able to almost
break even in 1951-52 (actually
(be 11)51-52 Daily was $17 18 in
the red). '
Last June, however, it appeared
that the Daily was going to come
out with a profit, *and furthermore
the Women's Clubhouse and the
Union Board of Governors both de
cided that they needed their 25
cents per student per quarter back,
so they retracted the subsidy. Thus,
the Daily was left in the lurch.
This fact was not recognized by
any of (ho parties concerned ex
cept the Daily business manager,
who was powerless lo change
matters.
Last fall, however, the Student
Manager realized (be predica
ment; and, with the deficit now
very apparent, action was taken
to increase the paper's income by
an actual increase in student fees
in.stead of by a revocable subsidy.
Actually, without the subsidy in
1950-51 the paper would have gone

almost $3,000 in debt, and wthout
the subsidy last year the debtvould
have totaled over $5,000. Wi|i the
prospect this year for a $3,000 debt,
it i|i obviofts that the Daily
last long at this rate.
Recognizing the Daily as a nec
essary student and Univtfsily
publication, the ASSU Excoi on
Wednesday night voted to retomi
mend an increase in Daily -<ul>
scription fees which are take*
from the ASSU tuition fees.
Since the only thing the \SS j
could do was to re-allocate it| own
three dollars per student per Quar
ter fees, and since the paper needed
the increase to survive, 25 cents
per student per quarter was taken
from the SAB fees (from the ASSU
funds) and given to the Daily. This
is only for autumn, winter, av...l
spring quarter—the summer flut
ter SAB fees will remain the same
since the Summer Daily is separate
from the regular Daily, and djes
not need any increase in reverue.
ASSU Excom made only a rec
ommendation, since that is at f*r
as its power goes. The final deci
sion must now be made by the pres
ident of the University, and linally
it must be approved by the Uni
versity Board of Trustees.
