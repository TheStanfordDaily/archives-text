# Edwards Is Optimistic About Farm's future
## 
### 
"While the future of the University looks difficult financially, I
have the utmost confidence that Stanford will come out all right—
it always has in the past."
That's the prediction of Paul C. Edwards, president of the Stan
ford University Board of Trustees and associate editor of the San

j Francisco News, who is retiring
[ from active public affairs next
j month after a lifetime devoted to
his profession, his city, and his Uni
versity.
This year's Stanford Quad is
dedicated to Edwards for giving
"generously on all fronts — in
hours, even days taken from the
already busy life of a new#>aper
excctuivc, and in wisdom for
which President Sterling is pro
foundly grateful."
Edwards has been a member of
the Board of Trustees since 1043 and
became president in 1948 — serving
during a particularly important
Stanford era.
Two of Stanford's four presidents
were chosen in these years — Dr.
Donald B. Tresidder and Dr. Wal
| lace Sterling. It was also the pe
riod when the Board of Trustees
began Stanford's land development
program.
Edwards counts his presidential
term on the hoard as "the most
satisfying and greatest thing in
| my life."
"The office was a continual in
, spiration and challenge." he says.
Edwards has been with the San
I Francisco News since 1932, and
I prior to that edited the Dallas Dis
patch, the Houston Press, the San
Diego Sun, and was editor-in-chief
jof the Southwestern chain of
I Scripps-Howard newspapers.
A graduate of the class of 1906,
j Edwards edited the campus "Lit,"
"Sequoia," as an undergraduate, and
[ was a member of both the Quad
| rangle and English clubs. His fra-
I trinity was Delta Upsilon.
The Edwards family is unani
| mously Stanford: Mrs. Edwards, the
| former Georgia Lyman, received
i her A.B.' degree with the class of
j 1907. A son, Paul C. Edwards, was
graduated in engineering in 1937,
and a daughter, Carol Edwards
Ammen, in 1942.
