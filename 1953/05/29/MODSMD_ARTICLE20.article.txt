# The 						Editor's Will
## 
### 
Before we take leave of the editors' pen,
there arc a couple of matters of present and
future thought we will to campus.
We haven't seen a copy of the agenda for
the spring meeting of the PCC faculty repre
sentatives—such information is "off the rec
ord" to the mass of university students inti
mately concerned with it.
Nevertheless, the fact has leaked that the
representatives will probably act to abandon
freshman intercollegiate competition.
The idea is undoubtedly to help "aeempha
size" college athletics—meaning football, and
to some extent the other major sports.
One difficulty is that schools will continue
to hold organized practice for freshman sports.
As a result, the freshmen will still devote much
time and effort to athletics without getting any
of the fun.
If the practice sessions are also abandoned,
we shudder at the resulting poor quality of
college athleiics.
This brings us to the nub of the whole ques
tion of deemphasis. If the faculty representa
tives really want to subordinate athletics to
academics, they should grapple with the prob
lem of finding another way lo finance physical
education programs.
Until the biggest incentive—box office pro
fits for proselyting athletes is removed, any
skirting th© edge of the problem—like aban
doning frosh athletics will result in no real
gain.
Our other bequest is a large and very sharp

needle to poke into student political activity.
Not national political activity, though, for the
campus is finally becoming conscious of na
tional politics.
We mean a needle to jab the campus awake
to a simple day-to-day interest in student gov
ernment.
Time and time again we have sat through an
Excom meeting in which half the members
barely mumbled an automatic "aye" when a
vote was called for, and did nothing else.
When Excom moved out of its cramped
meeting place into the hinterland of campus
living groups—rarely did a single observer,
critical or otherwise—appear.
Every once in a while we or a couple of other
members put a question or motion deliber
ately and devilishly "out of line" simply to
instill a bit of life into the proceedings.
A few minutes of frantic debate generally
ensued, then a relapse into the customary
lethargy.
Consequently, if there is one thing v/e look
for in next year's Excom—one thing that will
inspire a renewed interest in student govern
ment—it is a tendency among the members to
rant and rave — thoughtfully — but lively
enough to kick up a fuss just the same.
And now that we've heard our last staffer
(even ourselves) say, "my precious prose is
uncuttable"; and now that we've mercilessly
slashed that precious prose, including our own,
in half for the last time. . . . Good luck, Had
lay, Sue, and the ASSU in general.

ernment.
Time and time again we have sat through an
Excom meeting in which half the members
barely mumbled an automatic "aye" when a
vote was called for, and did nothing else.
When Excom moved out of its cramped
meeting place into the hinterland of campus
living groups—rarely did a single observer,
critical or otherwise—appear.
Every once in a while we or a couple of other
members put a question or motion deliber
ately and devilishly "out of line" simply to
instill a bit of life into the proceedings.
A few minutes of frantic debate generally
ensued, then a relapse into the customary
lethargy.
Consequently, if there is one thing v/e look
for in next year's Excom—one thing that will
inspire a renewed interest in student govern
ment—it is a tendency among the members to
rant and rave — thoughtfully — but lively
enough to kick up a fuss just the same.
And now that we've heard our last staffer
(even ourselves) say, "my precious prose is
uncuttable"; and now that we've mercilessly
slashed that precious prose, including our own,
in half for the last time. . . . Good luck, Had
lay, Sue, and the ASSU in general.
Before we take leave of the editors' pen,
there arc a couple of matters of present and
future thought we will to campus.
We haven't seen a copy of the agenda for
the spring meeting of the PCC faculty repre
sentatives—such information is "off the rec
ord" to the mass of university students inti
mately concerned with it.
Nevertheless, the fact has leaked that the
representatives will probably act to abandon
freshman intercollegiate competition.
The idea is undoubtedly to help "aeempha
size" college athletics—meaning football, and
to some extent the other major sports.
One difficulty is that schools will continue
to hold organized practice for freshman sports.
As a result, the freshmen will still devote much
time and effort to athletics without getting any
of the fun.
If the practice sessions are also abandoned,
we shudder at the resulting poor quality of
college athleiics.
This brings us to the nub of the whole ques
tion of deemphasis. If the faculty representa
tives really want to subordinate athletics to
academics, they should grapple with the prob
lem of finding another way lo finance physical
education programs.
Until the biggest incentive—box office pro
fits for proselyting athletes is removed, any
skirting th© edge of the problem—like aban
doning frosh athletics will result in no real
gain.
Our other bequest is a large and very sharp

needle to poke into student political activity.
Not national political activity, though, for the
campus is finally becoming conscious of na
tional politics.
We mean a needle to jab the campus awake
to a simple day-to-day interest in student gov
ernment.
