# Meeting the People
## 
### 
Four years at Stanford and at the Daily—
what stands out above everything? It's the
people who stand out.
It's the frantic individual who requests a col
or.3d banner headline to boom his activity, the
dance chairman who wants a picture every
day, the committee head who demands "top
right, front page" play for his project, and the
inevitable salesman who wants little fillers say
ing "Buy Yours Today" sprinkled through the
pap®r.
But it's also the chairman who brings in a
day-by-day schedule for his event, the commit
y tee head who has information organized and
„ ready f"v 'he reporter, the mastermind who
ft gets his committee there on time when a pic
■ ture is rchedtiled, not to mention the harrassed
'jt president who realizes that we have our trou
£ bles, too.
112 Above all are the stand-outs who realize we
112 are trying to give Stanford a newspaper, not

just a bulletin board, that we are trying for a
balance of &1I the news at school plus the high
lights of the news outside within a readable
frame of makeup.
The Daily is for all of these people—promot
ers, publicists, and just plain readers alike. So
it is that listening to the other side of a story
is part of our job as well as explaining the
Daily's side of it, policy-wise. As this two-way
understanding grows, Daily coverage grows.
We urge Stanford's program planners to let
the managing editor know when something's
going to happen; to come in and talk it over;
to make suggestions for pictures; in short, to
exchange problems.
It's the people who did this who stand out
now. Wrangling with them added much to our
own personal experience as well as bettering
the Daily itself. Meeting the people is one of
the high points of the job. Sue—have fun with
it. —Mary Massey
