# Now It's Up to Us
## 
### 
Our four-year learning period at Stanford is
almost over. But college graduation is cer
tainly not the end of our education process-—
learning and investigation doesn't stop when
we clasp that diploma.
College, ot course, is only a stimulant—a
taste. It has taught many of us how to seek
only the drop of knowledge that man can
hope to acquire in his lifetime.
It has made many of us intellectually curi
ous in the humanities, the sciences.
And we hope it ha 3 made us more tolerant—
tolerant of other attitudes, beliefs, and opin
ions. For tolerance is the basis of any demo
cratic society — or at least any society that
hopes to remain democratic.
Neither this University nor any other
school would be proud of a graduate who
would say, Well, now I know all I want to
knew," or 'Whew, 1 can relax, I'm through
with learning."
We may be through with school, but we're

just beginning to learn. For learning continues
no matter what role we play in society.
Only now it will be tougher. Nobody will
be saying: "read this book," or "the boss won't
like it if you hand that report in late." Nobody
will be giving the orcfters, nobody will be warn
ing us that we are falling down in our obliga
tions.
The success we make of our lives and our
jobs, just as the success we made or didn't
make in college, is up to us.
Let's not kid ourselves— many ot us took
our college years just a little too lightly. But
we can't take our role in the somewhat dis
sheveled world with the same attitude.
Whether we're graduating as a Phi Bete or
as a C student, June 15 will bring us the same
basic problems.
We're confident that Stanford men and wom
en—the senior men and women of '53 will meet
and accept these problems.
