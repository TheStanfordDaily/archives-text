# Next Year Looks Good
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
What's in store for Stanford ath
letic teams next year?
With a 3-D technicolor crystal
ball in one hand and a slide rule
in the other, we try to predict what
Farm teams will do next year.
Briefly, the football, basketball,
swimming, tennis, and golf teams
should be stronger, while the track
and baseball squads will probably
suffer a drop in quality.
FOOTBALL
Next year, more than ever, the
PCC race will he between the
four California schools, Stanford,
Cal, UCLA, and USC. UCLA will
he favored if Paul Cameron stays
healthy.
Chuck Taylor's men should be
stronger next year for two reasons:
(1) the dropping of the platoon
system will be of advantage to the

Indians; and (2) Stanford is less
hard hit by graduation than the
other schools.
It's true that Skip Crist, Len
Mayrhofer, Chuck Essegiqn, Bob
Mathias, Ron Eadic, A 1 Kirkland,
and Jim Vick are lost from the
football wars, but all the above have
strong replacements except Mathias.
The success or failure of the '51!
team will depend in good meas
ure upon how successful Taylor is
in producing an outstanding full
hack. Mathias has another year
eligibility and will be at school
next fall, but doesn't enjoy foot
ball enough to turn out for it
again.
The answer might well be found
in freshman Jim Truher, who has
the ideal qualifications for full
back. lie is big (about 205) and
fast (he has done the 100 in 7).
Truher has been injured a good
part of the football year, and so
hasn't had an opportunity to dis
play all his wares.
But he could well prove to be a
sensational answer to the problem.
One of the main causes for opti
mism is the return of Norm Manoo
gian, who should be a cinch All-
American next year. Said Taylor,
"Norm would have meant the dif
ference in about two games this

Another particularly blight spot
has hcen the spring performances
of tackle Matt Armitagc. Again
drooled Taylor, "That hoy has got
it!"
Sam Morlcy and John Steinberg
are back at ends, with high jumper
John Stewart a definite contender.
Eight top men are fighting it out
for tackle, with Armitage and Ted
Tanner probably the top men. The
guards should be Manoogian and
Phil Wilson, and Joe Long and Jer
ry Goldberg will battle the center
slot.
Bob Garrett has quarterback
cinched. Ron Cook, running better
than ever, seems to be the left half,
and defensive sensation Don San
ders has the inside track on right
half, if he wins the battle with the
books.
BASKETBALL
The PCC Southern Division in
ifcasketball should be ferociously
close next year. Just every
one returns for Stanford, but, un
happily, such is the case with the
other schools.
Gone are jumping George Zanin
ovich and deadly Paul Johnson, but
back for another fling are Ron (the
Cat) Russ Lawler, Don
DeLong, Olie Suzdaleff, Dave Ep
person and sensational George Sel
leek up from the frosh. Don Carl
son, the great rebounder, also has
another year if he can convince his

draft board that he should continue
higher learning.
Cal has its two aces, center Bob
McKeen and gu&rd Bob Matheny
back, and USC and UCLA, both
with young teams this year, should
be murder next season. Stanford's
main problem will be getting
enough height into the lineup.
BASEBALL
Chuck Essegian, Bob Murphy, and
Jack Shepard may not be indispens
able, but if they aren't, they come
about as close to being indispens
able as ball players can be.
Everett Dean will still probably
have the best infield in the CIBA.

Warren Goodrich, Ray Swarts, and
Rich ScramagKa all return as do
pitchers Phil Page, Ken Brown, and
Don DeLong and outfielder A 1 Tal
boy.
But the three big guns are gone,
and IJSC and Cal will probably
be favored.
TRACK
There are some monsters coming
up from the frosh team, but the fact
remains that shot putter Howie
Hertz, miler Bob Simon, and hur
dler - discus man - shot putter - high
jumper Bob Mathias will be gone.
And when you lose Mathias, you
lose a lot of points.
It should be the same old story
of Stanford playing second liddle
to USC. Again, they'll have one
of the best teams in the country,
but not enough to take the Tro
jans.
Spearheading Jack Weiershauser's
cindermen will be high jumper John
Stewart, javelin men Leo Long and
Bob Kimball, sprinter Keith
Brownsberger, hurdlers Jerry Wood
and Jim Luttrell, two-miler Bob
Reed, and quarter - miler Fred
George.
SWIMMING
Tom Haynie, considered by his
fellow coaches as the best swim
coach in America, will again have
the best swim team west of the
Mississippi. Nationally, the Stan
ford splashers should be about third
or fourth.
The Farm mermen should be
even stronger next year because
Larry Ilcim, Dan Osborne, and
Jim Gaughran, the big guns, all
return. Add to this a host of other
seasoned veterans and a powerful
frosh team, and you have another
great swim squad.
TENNIS
They're confident out on the
courts. Everyone from Coach Bob
Renker down to the junior mana
ger expects Stanford's first tennis
championship in cons.
Nationally seeded Jack Frost will
be eligible for varsity competition
next year, and with raquetmcn Jim
Cornish and Art Fish also around,
the squad should be loaded.
GOLF
Rounding out a bevy of strong
spring sports athletic teams, the
Card divotmen will again be vying
for the national championship. War
j rcn Dailey, Fred Brown, and Grant
| Spaeth are expected to have a bril
j liant year.
