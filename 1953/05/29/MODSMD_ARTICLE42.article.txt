# POT SHOTS — Mike Hudson
## One More Time Around 
### 
Four years at Stanford can provide a lot of great sports memories. As
long as men like Pomeroy, Manoogian, Kerkorian, McColl, Yardley,
Tucker, Tomsic, Chez, Essegian, Shepard, Murphy, Mathias, and Bryan
were out there, the Cards always had a chance. And win or lose, they
always put on a good show.
These men received their full share of praise from the Daily, however,
so how about a tribute to the bad guys—the opposition, who also put
on some good shows of their own.
In football, we recall Don Heinrich bombing the Cards out of the 1950
Rose Bowl race, and Les Richter's herculean performance in the 1951
Big Game. In basketball, Bill Sharman of USC comes to mind. He always
got his 20 points, yet he was one of the finest team players and defensive
men we ever saw.
How about a tribute to USC's track team. They arc always good.
Against Stanford, they become superhuman (and do the times they did in
high school).
Last, how about a cheer for men like USF's Gene Sweeters in football
and Marv Bowerman in basketball; Cal's three stellar quarterbacks Jim
Marinos, Bill Mais, and Boots Erb, and Santa Clara's .050 hitting and field
ing catcher Lou Lucas, USC's Bob Morton and UCLA's Karl Kraushaar in
basketball. With athletes like this around, Stanford will always have a
chaqce.
Three weeks ago a widely publicized athletic round-table was held.
A group of men representing the top level of athletics at Stanford gathered
to hear all the gripes of the students about sports. About fifty people
showed up. About thirty had anything to complain about. About five
had anything to complain about except the lack of crew support.
It is too bad that the athletic department can't support the oarsmen, yet
they would do well to remember that only five private schools in the na
tion do support crew, and Stanford is no longer as wealthy as these other
schools.
But the lack of attendance at the round-table went to prove something
else that students too often forget. Stanford has probably the finest ath
letic plant and program in the nation.
Certainly no other school which demands the rigorous scholastic
average of their athletes that Stanford does can put such consistently good
teams on the field.
And what other school can boast of the facilities for non-athletes who
still like to get a little exercise now and then—the many tennis cpurts,
the basketball games in the Encina Gymn, one of the nation's best golf
courses, men's and women's swimming pools, beginning instruction in
any sport, and last, and most important, a complete mural program. No
other college can match all this.

Finally a salute to the sports staff, who will all be with you next year
again. The new editor is four-year Icttcrman Pete Grothe (accent
acute s'il vous plait), author, world traveler, and undoubtedly Stanford's
most loyal fan. Next we have the second platoon of Phil Berman, Dick
Maltzman, and Don Webster, who between them combine the attributes
of a perfect sports reporter.
JC flashes Lou Pujalet and Don Stephens return, and Irwin Johnson
returns after two years overseas (in Oakland) and Elmore Seeds, torn be
tween a future in medicine, sports writing, or professional golf, comes
back too.
Then come the boys who will be writing the whole Daily year after next,
Russ Wilks, Bill Wright, Dick Koenigsberger, and Yic Casebolt.
Six athletes of various sorts are now members of the sports staff. This
is a dangerous trend, and should be curbed.
Another new trend found Misses Dorothy Dodge and Barbara Tuerk
taking the desk once this volume. Miss Tuerk's classic head, "Is Hamilton
Field Going to Yield" drew varied reaction from the school in general and
edit board in particular.
Last, and certainly least, a salute to the photography staff who made up
in inertia what they lacked in sobriety. They were still pretty good guys,
however.

high school).
Last, how about a cheer for men like USF's Gene Sweeters in football
and Marv Bowerman in basketball; Cal's three stellar quarterbacks Jim
Marinos, Bill Mais, and Boots Erb, and Santa Clara's .050 hitting and field
ing catcher Lou Lucas, USC's Bob Morton and UCLA's Karl Kraushaar in
basketball. With athletes like this around, Stanford will always have a
chaqce.
Three weeks ago a widely publicized athletic round-table was held.
A group of men representing the top level of athletics at Stanford gathered
to hear all the gripes of the students about sports. About fifty people
showed up. About thirty had anything to complain about. About five
had anything to complain about except the lack of crew support.
It is too bad that the athletic department can't support the oarsmen, yet
they would do well to remember that only five private schools in the na
tion do support crew, and Stanford is no longer as wealthy as these other
schools.
But the lack of attendance at the round-table went to prove something
else that students too often forget. Stanford has probably the finest ath
letic plant and program in the nation.
Certainly no other school which demands the rigorous scholastic
average of their athletes that Stanford does can put such consistently good
teams on the field.
And what other school can boast of the facilities for non-athletes who
still like to get a little exercise now and then—the many tennis cpurts,
the basketball games in the Encina Gymn, one of the nation's best golf
courses, men's and women's swimming pools, beginning instruction in
any sport, and last, and most important, a complete mural program. No
other college can match all this.

Finally a salute to the sports staff, who will all be with you next year
again. The new editor is four-year Icttcrman Pete Grothe (accent
acute s'il vous plait), author, world traveler, and undoubtedly Stanford's
most loyal fan. Next we have the second platoon of Phil Berman, Dick
Maltzman, and Don Webster, who between them combine the attributes
of a perfect sports reporter.
JC flashes Lou Pujalet and Don Stephens return, and Irwin Johnson
returns after two years overseas (in Oakland) and Elmore Seeds, torn be
tween a future in medicine, sports writing, or professional golf, comes
back too.
Then come the boys who will be writing the whole Daily year after next,
Russ Wilks, Bill Wright, Dick Koenigsberger, and Yic Casebolt.
Six athletes of various sorts are now members of the sports staff. This
is a dangerous trend, and should be curbed.
Another new trend found Misses Dorothy Dodge and Barbara Tuerk
taking the desk once this volume. Miss Tuerk's classic head, "Is Hamilton
Field Going to Yield" drew varied reaction from the school in general and
edit board in particular.
Last, and certainly least, a salute to the photography staff who made up
in inertia what they lacked in sobriety. They were still pretty good guys,
however.
Four years at Stanford can provide a lot of great sports memories. As
long as men like Pomeroy, Manoogian, Kerkorian, McColl, Yardley,
Tucker, Tomsic, Chez, Essegian, Shepard, Murphy, Mathias, and Bryan
were out there, the Cards always had a chance. And win or lose, they
always put on a good show.
These men received their full share of praise from the Daily, however,
so how about a tribute to the bad guys—the opposition, who also put
on some good shows of their own.
In football, we recall Don Heinrich bombing the Cards out of the 1950
Rose Bowl race, and Les Richter's herculean performance in the 1951
Big Game. In basketball, Bill Sharman of USC comes to mind. He always
got his 20 points, yet he was one of the finest team players and defensive
men we ever saw.
How about a tribute to USC's track team. They arc always good.
Against Stanford, they become superhuman (and do the times they did in
high school).
