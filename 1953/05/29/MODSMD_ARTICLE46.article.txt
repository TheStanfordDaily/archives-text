# '52-'53 Pretty Good Year
## 
### 
FOOTBALL: Stanford's football
team split five-five. They beat the
weak teams, they lost to the good
ones. Bob Mathias gained over 600
yards and Bob Garrett was outstand
ing at quarterback until injured. K
Bill Rogers galloped 96 yards
against Oregon State and Sam Mor
ley was among the nation's leaders
in passing-catching. Other star line
men included Jim Vick, Phil Wilson,
John Stanton, and Matt Armitage.
Line backers Chuck' Essegian and
Ted Tanner were rough, but the pass
defense proved to be the team's
downfall. The JV's had an unsuc
cessful season.
FROSII FOOTBALL: After a re
sounding 42-0 victory over UCLA
to start their season; Stanford's
freshman footballers wound up their
year with a two-two record. Many
Papooses showed potential, however,
to win spots on the varsity and they
include ends John Stewart and Steve
Doctor, backs Jim Truher and Bill
Tarr.
WATER POLO: Stanford's water
polo team failed to repeat at PCC
champions, but finished in second
place behind Cal with a 3 and 3
record. In non-league competition
the Cards downed all four opponents.
SOCCER: Stanford soccer varsity
had a fine season compiling its best
record since 1930 with a 6 won, 2 lost,
2 tied record. It loses only three of
its starters next year.
BASKETBALL: It was long,
hard season for Bob Burnett's bas
ketballers as they won but seven
of their twenty-seven contests and
finished a dismal last in the PCC
Southern Division.
Still there were plenty of high
lights during the year, including a
sharpshooting sophomore guard
named Ron Tomsic who broke the
school record held by the immortal
Hank Luisetti with 519 points.
Ron also set a new scoring record
for the Cow Palace and tied the PCC
record for points in a game. He'll be
around for two more seasons to fire
away at the basket.
JV BASKETBALL: Under the di
rection of two coaches, Ed Tucker
and George Lynn the Braves took
10 out of 12 contests this year, in
cluding a sweep of four games
against Cal. High scorers were
Howie Schwartz, Wayne Culberson,
Wayne Lockhart, Bob G'gorek, and
A1 Talboy.
FRGSH BASKETBALL: George
Selleck scored 270 points for a 15-
point average per game to pace the
frosh basketballers to a 17-1 seasonal
record, including four victories over
California.
The 17 victories tied the freshman
record for a single season.
TRACK: Coach Jack Weiershauser
had an almost completely veteran
track team left over from last year,
and had an extremely successful
season, with the exception of the
usual loss to SC and the upset loss

to Cal in the Big Meet by five points,
63-68. Top men were Bob Mathias,
Howie Hertz, and Bob Simon.
The Cards were deep and fast this
year, and scared the scivies off the
Trojans at the Fresno Relays. Oxy,
the Olympic Club, San Jose State,
Santa Clara Youth Centerâ€”all fell
victim to the powerful Indians.
FROSII TRACK: The Papoose
cindermen won all their meets in
cluding Cal, but one this spring. High
jumper John Stewars set a new frosh
mark, while Jim Truher, Jim Lutrell,
and Ralph Love also stood out.
BASEBALL: The baseball team
had an outstanding season, compiling
a 28-and-13 record thus far this
season. The club was considered by
many to be the finest nine in Stan
ford history.
Sparking the club were three
players: catcher Jack Shepard, pit
cher Bob Murphy, and leftfielder
Chuck Essegian.
JV BASEBALL: The Bi'ave nine
had a successful season as they won
10 out of 13 games winding up the
year by drubbing the Cal JV's 10-1.
Gil Duncan headed the pitching
department as he copped four out
of five decisions. Terry Evans, Sid
Hall, and Clarke Nelson led the hit
ters.
FROSH BASEBALL: Stanford's
freshman baseball nine, relying
heavily on the consistent pitching
of Ray Young and the hard hitting
15 wins, four losses, and one tie
of George Selleck, Ron Wagner, and
Mickey Holzman, finished up the
season under Coach Dick Clegg with
15 wins, four losses, and one tie.
SWIMMING: If you thought a
third straight PCC swimming crown
plus 24 straight dual meet victories
and a fifth in the NCAA finals were
more than enough for a team to
produce, wait until next season when
the same feats will be out done by
virtualy the same squad, including
Dan Osborne, Larry Helm, and Jim
Gaughran.
A strong freshman team that went
through the season also undefeated
is expected to supplement the strong
sophomore and junior laden varsity
team.
BOXING: Spectacular individual
performances enliveneed a non-win
ning year for Coach Ray Lunny.
Heavyweight Norm Manoogian
scored and received knockouts in his
first two bouts, while light-heavy
weight Bob Baldocchi continued to
win over every opponent before
losing his final bout of the year.
GYMNASTICS: Scoring wins over
San Jose State, among others, Stan
ford's gymnastics also had a suc
cessful year. Participating and scor
ing in practically every event was
Jerry Nesslerod, the captain and part
time coach.
RUGBY: Winning five of their
eight games, Stanford's rugby team
enjoyed a highly successful season
this spring. High point of the year

was the 17-16 win over Cal. Out
standing individuals were frosh Dor
sey Atkinson, Derek Howard, Ron
Cook, Dick Borda, and the ageless
Marty Feldman.
SKIING: The slopes were pretty
bare this year for the schussers, but
prospects look good for next season.
Top individuals were Dave Taylor,
Mike Adams, Macky Wirth, and
Doug Collins.
WRESTLING: The grunt and
groaners had a great season beat
ing Cal in their final match, for only
the third time in 37 years. Top in
dividuals were Jack Oglesby, Pat
Madden, and Ken James.
FENCING: Climaxing their year
with a win over Cal, the fencers also
won the West Coast College cham
pionship. Top performers were Ralph
Amado and Thorny Garrett.
TENNIS: Hampered by injuries,
Coach Bob Renker's squad came in
a winless last in the PCC. Outstand
ing individuals were Charlie Hickox,
Captain Bob Sibert, Art Fish, and
Jim Cornish. Jack Frost led the frosh
to an undefeated year.
GOLF: Stanford's golfers lost only
three dual meets and rate as one of
the best teams in the country. The
team consists of Warren Dailey, Fred
Brown, Grant Spaeth, Art Ledbet
ter, Stu Ledbetter, Bob Sims.
The frosh, led by Phil Getchell
and John Forbusch, were unde
feated in dual match play.
CREW: Stanford's crew tied USC
in a disputed race, beat UCLA, Ore
gon State, and was defeated several
times by Cal. Their bid for official
recognition and support seemed per
manently doomed. The frosh had a
very strong boaat.
POLO: Led by Allen Scherer,
Stanford's polo team had a good year
with wins over New Mexico Military,
Colorado Aggies, and Arizona. They
also played in the National Collegiate
championships in New York.
