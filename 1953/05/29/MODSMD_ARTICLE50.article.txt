# THE
						YEAR IN REVIEW
## Politics, Petitions Prevail 
### BARBARA TUERK 
From a fall devoted to impas
sioned political debate, through
a winter full of academic free
dom discussions, to a spring
Blood Drive that shattered world
records, this year's Stanford
students served notice that
they've drawn back the Ivory
Curtain once and for all.
And at the same time, lest any
one forget that they're still students,
they established "Grass on Inner
Quad Com," gave their Spring Sing
sweepstakes to an Alpha Delt ren
dition of "Wildroot Cream Oil Char
ley," and threw a graveyard party.
It all started hack in Septem
ber, when the 1952-1953 student
body first showed up on the Farm,
7.32(> of them, including more
frosh men than ever before.
Eisenhower and Stevenson visited
San Francisco, where both were
greeted by cheering car caravans of
Stanford enthusiasts.
Even the faculty broke into the
political news. Two hundred
twenty - six of them started a
campus furor by publishing a pe
tition backing Stevenson.
The students were quick to an
swer in a Daily poll that, notwith
standing their professors, they were
for Eisenhower, two to one.
The Stanford student body wel
comed five students from the Free
University of Berlin, sent here by
the United States government to
study student government in a
school where it was "unusually

strong."
Excom started out the fall by vot
ing $2,000 to repair the crumbling
boathouse on Lake Lag and estab
lishing "Grass on Inner Quad Com."
Later they asked—but did not get
—student approval on two resolu
tions to ask the State Legislature to
lower the legal drinking age to 18.
The football team started o!l'
like a house afive, and students,
with memories of last year's Rose
Bowl jaunt, envisioned another
PCC crown.
But after victories over WSC,
OSC, Santa Clara, and Michigan,
the team ran into UCLA and things
changed. The low point came when
USC racked up 54 points against the
Cards, the worst score ever.
The Big Game loss that followed
was almost an anti - climax. "No
cards, no mike, no banner, no foot
ball team," Cal fans jeered as winds
demolished Stanford's half - time
plans.
Farm studpnts retaliated with a
smokeboinb in the Cal rooting sec
tion, and by the time everyone was
headed back down the Peninsula for
Big Game parties the loss was for
gotten.
A Stanford name made interna
tional news when Dr. Felix Bloch
of the Physics Department was
awarded a Nobel Prize for his
work in nuclear induction.
Stanford students returned from
Christmas vacation to find that, the
machine age had arrived. The men
and women marked "one" (for
males) or "two" (for females) on
the IBM cards didn't mind, but a
few transfers marked "three" were

disturbed.
Administration officials pitched in
with the students to get the "Stan
ford— Today and Tomorrow" pro
gram off to a booming start. For the
next three years University officials
will be discussing academics, build
ing and land developments, and
finances regularly with the students.
Stanford came back from Balboa
beeches and Sun Valley slopes to
the greatest blood-letting in college
history. Under the leadership of
Navy hero Ken Schechter, Stanford
donated 4,G40 pints of blood in five
days, a world record for five-day
blood drives.
The Con Home Drive set new rec
ords by collecting $8,300. "Tiger"
Dick Colbert, the shyest guy in the
Village, was elected King with a
record $205 worth of votes, and Ro
ble frosli Carol Lazza resell i was
crowned his Queen.
Schroeder, a friendly German
Sheph e r d , and "someone up
above"' enlivened a Spring Sing
which for the first time in many

years was NOT won by thtiVfed
School. Guthrie and the )elts
took their division with "Sjging
in the Rain," and it did—lin—
right in the middle of th< song
for the first time in Sprin; Sing
history.
The campus buzzed withargu
ments on "Research vs. Tephint
as Dr. Alfred Sumner of theQeog
raphy Department was dismissed.
The Sigma Nu's went off camtis for
two quarters because of a Ituor
law violation, and a
house with 16 addresses.
And Excom appointed an Aca
demic Freedom Committee.
As exams neared, frosh larted
worrying about becoming |>pho
mores; sophs suddenly realize) they
were going to be upper diision;
juniors thought about senic re
sponsibilities; and seniors iound
themselves almost "out ii the
world."
But all concerned could 100 l back
on '52-'53 and sigh, "It's been t good
year!"
