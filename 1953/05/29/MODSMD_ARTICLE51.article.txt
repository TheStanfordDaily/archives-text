# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
FAREWELL CLASS OF '5.i
This is no sob-stuff last Bull Session. With the con
sent of the heavens and Draft Board 57, we'll be back
for graduate study. This is just kind of a tribute to
1,130 graduating seniors, and particularly to those who
have meant the class of *53 to me. It's a tribute to
1,130 seniors who lour years ago were saying, "To hell
with '52" and who right now are finding it a little
hard to believe that someone will be yelling "To hell
with '57" next year. And who are maybe wishing

deep down inside that they'll be
missed a little on Quad next fall.
To the person who reads about
the graduating class in the papers,
it will be an inanimate body ol
812(1 young citizens. To those of us
in the class, or to those who know
the Class of '53, it is one huge
personality, seething with indi
viduality.
Personally, we'll always re
member:

Red-thatehed Dick Weismann, the ASSLT prexy
with the shy smile, who has been about as qualified
and effective a president as any student body could
want; highly likeable Joe St. Genie, who, in fall
quarter amazed everyone by taking the most stag
gering burden imaginable: football, senior class presi
dent, and med school.
Ellie Myers, the very able ASSU veep; Garner
Becket, one o' the infamous 5E gang in Enema, who
despite his early Farm environment mads Phi BL j te.
Ann Alabaster, the third in the dynasty of four
Stanford Alabaster girls, as sweet a coed as the
Farm ever turned out; Brynhild Grasmocn, the Mer
ced beauty with the Scandanavian monicker, who can
blaze down a slope of snow so fast.
Three crazy characters up at Hurlburt, Mary Mas
sey, Kay Kleinpel), and Jill Bingham. Mike Hudson,
the number one character in the class. Mike's proud
est achievement —-running out of gas nine times on
Palm Drive; Ruby Bernstein, the chaplain, mother,
and throaty song leader of the Daily staff; > Susan -
ville's gilt to civilization, Dorothy Dodge, who in my
mind is about the finest editor the Daily ever had.
Skip Crist, Ken Downey, and Bob Murphy, a trio
of athletes who rate as three of the most refreshing
individuals on campus; gag-man Bob Blackburn, an
old ski buddy of mine who ranks with the best of
them when it comes to lapping up the suds at Rosots.

Courageous Chris Field, the oidy Democrat up at the
Phi Sig house.
liaehel Caiman, the personality girl from the town 1
that no one ever heard of—Dundae, Illinois. Raeh's
favorite pastime is running her toes through the wet
grass on a night in which there is thunder and light- !
ning; Nini Moore, Rachel's mannerism twin, who is j
always saying, "Ilow nice"; Mary Gwt-n For an, the |
Corpus Christi immigrant with the lilting Southern I
accent.
Waltanlibby, better known as Walt Mciuiinger and i
Connie ! ibl'ey, who will pause long enough in their j
hurried lives to get married next month; two former !
good-guy room-mates ol mine whom I've always had \
a strong fi iendship for, Jack Butler and Al Thomp
son; Joyce Engbloiu, my favorite [tersort from Hay
ward.
Steve Horn, the student manager whose affability
is only exceeded by his brilliance; Ann Livingston
who can imitate Dr. Spiegelberg better than anyone
on tampus; New York's Jack Pouting, my debating
partner and Stanford's number one individualist'
Fulbright scholar Lola Sullivan, who despite the fact
she went Phi Bete and only received one "B" at Stan
lord, is really a very nice girl.
Geography major Elaine Spratt, the Jordan head
dragon who ranks aif Stanford's top fisherman;
Nason Fishliack, the shy-guy high jumper from the
plains of South Dakota; basketballer George Zanin
ovich, he of the furrowed brow. DelanfeZeno is presi
dent of the "Lie on the Lawn in Club."
Popular Hoy Alexander, one of Stanford's most capa
ble student leaders.
Jean Fox. the smiling extrovert from Hawaii; Maizie
May, the fussing, fuming half-pint personality kid
from Boston; sky-scraper Dan Wilbur, the talented
student leader-basketballer-psych major.
Theater-wise Ilal Burdick, who should go far in
show business; bubbling Melba Wiser; basketballer
Fritz Fenster, as high-character an individual as the
Farm turns out; Larry Calm, the strong, silent sports
man; likeable Laude Netf, whom everyone kefcps cal
ling "Digger"; Charlotte Mesick, the gifted senior
secretary; IFB prexy Chuck Deuny.
Then there's Fred Backer, Barbara Bird, John
Houser, Joyce Ballantine, Sue Hey, and Dick Cole.

ater-mural footballer Jim Zarifes, and so many, many
more.
To hell with '57! !

FAREWELL CLASS OF '5.i
This is no sob-stuff last Bull Session. With the con
sent of the heavens and Draft Board 57, we'll be back
for graduate study. This is just kind of a tribute to
1,130 graduating seniors, and particularly to those who
have meant the class of *53 to me. It's a tribute to
1,130 seniors who lour years ago were saying, "To hell
with '52" and who right now are finding it a little
hard to believe that someone will be yelling "To hell
with '57" next year. And who are maybe wishing

deep down inside that they'll be
missed a little on Quad next fall.
To the person who reads about
the graduating class in the papers,
it will be an inanimate body ol
812(1 young citizens. To those of us
in the class, or to those who know
the Class of '53, it is one huge
personality, seething with indi
viduality.
