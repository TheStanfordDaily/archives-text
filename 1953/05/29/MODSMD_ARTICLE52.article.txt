To the Editor:
The criticism of Mr. Harry Havilio of the excessive
representation of Europeans on the ASSU Foreign
Scholarship Program is entirely justified.
Their selection, however, was not the result of dis
crimination or bias on the part of the Committee. It
has been and will continue to be the Committee's
desire to broaden the regional distribution of the AS
SU awards beyond the confines of Europe. Â»
Through the UNESCO Bulletin, "Study Abroad,"
and by means of over forty announcements, publicity
was sent to non-European areas. The response from
non-Europeans was very small.
In addition, the ASSU cannot afford to provide
travel funds for award winners. In order to insure
travel funds for non-Europeans, they are requested to
apply though us indirectly through the Institute of
International Education. Europeans must give us as
surance that they are applying for Fulbright travel
funds. Space for further essential details about this
travel problem is lacking; however, we will be very
glad to give additional information if personally con
tacted.
One hundred twenty completed applications were
received for consideration this year. The Committee
read each of these and submitted the 25 most quali
fied applicants to the representatives of the living
groups who make the final choice. Among the 17 men
submitted, two were Orientals and two were Arabs.
They were not among the 5 men selected.
Almost a third of all applicants are Germans, more
than from all of Latin Europe. We do not feel that the
selection of two Germans was unfair. The third,
Wolfgang Hartenstein, is receiving no funds from the
ASSU. His scholarship is being administered only,

by the ASSU tor the Berlin Affiliation Committee ol'
the IIR.
We hope this bare outline of problems answers the
misunderstanding apparent among the student body.
