# On Academic Freedom
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Undoubtedly many people are thoroughly con
fused about the ASSU position on the current aca
demic freedom is.sue.
The official ASSU Academic Freedom Committee
was created Wednesday, May 13, when the Execu
tive Committee realized that student opinion de
manded consideration of the matter. At that meeting
a group of interested students presented a state
ment they were currently circulating for student
signatures. Essentially, the statement is a stand pro
testing congressional investigations in colleges and
universities.
Aware of its responsibility to the entire student
body, the Executive Committee officially declared that
it was not in a position to act on the statement at
that time. It also pointed out that the statement rep
resented only a few students, and recommended
further study under the sponsorship of the ASSU
on the subject of academic freedom and its various
related issues.
Since the President of the University had been a
leader in formulating a statement issued by the
American Association of Universities entitled. "The
Rights and Responsibilities of Universities and their
Facultes," he has shown sincere interest in cooper
ating with the committee program.
