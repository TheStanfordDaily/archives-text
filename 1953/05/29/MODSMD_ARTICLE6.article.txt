# Vigorous "Falstaff' Plays To Near Capacity House
## 
### RON ROSEN 
The Stanford Players and Music Departmenl once again col
laborated successfully in presenting Verdi's comic opera, "Fal
staff" before a near capacity house in Memorial Auditorium last
night. ,
The performance was vigorous and filled with enthusiasm, al-

though one found it necessary to ad-'
just his or her cars to a performance
which was not professional sound
ing as is sometimes the case with
very carefully wrought amateur,per
formances.
This reviewer found a great deal
of the clowning, especially in the
first act. overdone to a degree that
proved damaging to the inherent
and wry humor in this master
piece.
Sandor Salgo's astute musical di
rection proved, as usual, to be the
guiding force in t this performance
as in the opera presentations of the
past on the Stanford campus. He did
an outstanding job of training the
orchestra, which did have a smooth,
professional polish in playing Verdi's
sparkling melodies.
Francis Barnes' Falstaff was well
acted and well sung, a combination
which is seldom achieved in per
forming this role. He gave his
Falstaff all the life, vigor, and hu
mor that that character is associ
ated with on the Shakespearean
stage.
Barnes' performance was matched
by those of Ruth Rochr and James
Schwabacher, who portrayed Mis
tress Ford and Fenton, respectively.
Miss Rochr's voice should continue
to improve in the next few years
when more will be heard from her.
Equally outstanding among the
female performers were Joan Stcn
sen as Mistress Page, Lcona Odd
stad as Nanetta, and June VVilkens
as the busy Dame Quickly.
The sets and costumes (as usual
in Stanford productions) were very
fine. The opera continues its run
tonight and tomorrow night.


HER FATHER SAID NO—But Fenton (James Schwabacher) marries
Nanetta (Leona Oddstad) in Verdi's comic opera "Falstaff"
which opened last night in Mem Aud for a three day run. The
duo carry the sub-plot in the opera.
