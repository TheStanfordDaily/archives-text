# Dekes Get the Bounce
## 
### 
The Dekes received the heave-ho
off campus last week because of a
drinking party.
The Dekes will be suspended for
five quarters, beginning right after
Commencement exercises..
Announcement was made by Dr.
J. E. Wallace Sterling, who said that
the penalty was severe because of
"the house's long-standing record of
failure to contribute constructively to
the welfare of the University." Sterl
ing added that relapse after the chap
ter is reinstated could result in per
manent termination of the chapter.
The Dekes follow the Sigma Nus,
who were suspended last April.
