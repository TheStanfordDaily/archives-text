# A 						Final Message

### 
Joe St. Geme
Amazing is the realization that four
years could pass by so swiftly. That
hectic day of moving into Roble,
Branner, Encina, and Toyon for the
first time seems to have occurred an
unbelievably short time ago. The
years have been rich in experience,
knowledge, and a lot of down-right
good times.
What the future holds for us all,
no one knows; yet, it will be inter
esting to see just what our reunions
of the following years can tell us
about this game of life and how we
bore with it.
I would like to take this opportu
nity to thank Ann, Char, and the
rest of the class excom for the won
derful job they did this year and for
the pleasure of being able to work
with them.
The very best of luck to you all
and may every possible success and
happiness be yours from the day you
walk out of Frost Amphitheater for
the last time.

With help and enthusiasm of Sen
ior excom and members of the Class
of '53, the office of vice-president
has been an enjoyable one; the riot
ous election reunion, the rainy Lake
Lag opening, and class day exercises
are activities which many of us will
remember in the years to come. But
mainly, I think I'll remember the
people—the boys and girls who make
up this our unforgetable Class of
'53.

I should like to add my thanks to
all members of Senior Excom and
those others who have helped us
with our Senior activities.
John McCurdy, who broke all rec
ords on the sale of graduation pro
grams and announcements, deserves
special thanks—as well as everyone
who helped us on the Ice Cream
Sales. Their help has enabled our
class to leave a gift of about $1,000
to the Tresidder Memorial Union.
It's been a pleasure working with
all of you—let's hope our future class
reunions bring us together again.
See you in 2003!
