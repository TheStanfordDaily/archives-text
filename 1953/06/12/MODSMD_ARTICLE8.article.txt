We are on the verge of being
collegiate "has-beens."
If we had the four years to
live over again, many would do
it the same and many would do
it differently. Many of us have
looked at our today at Stanford
with the eyes of tomorrow. And
many of us have just considered
college as a four-year prolonga
tion of high school social ac
tivities.
But all that doesn't matter
now. The four years are behind.
Ahead, the future. Most of the
1,133 graduates will be success
ful. Many won't. A few will be
come millionaire bank presi
dents. A few will become pau
pers.
But whatever the future will
do to our individual lives, let us
make a vow to try to regather at
each year's reunion. Despite
that fact that the Class of '53 was
the only one ever to lose two
Frosh-Soph Jamborees, we have
a strong class spirit that should
n't be fettered too much by the
years.
And so as Class Secretary
Char Mesick says, "See you in
2,003." But not only in 2,003.
In 1954, 1955, 1956, 1980, 1990,
and in all the reunions that are
held. Because this will be our
only opportunity to regroup as
one, to share memories, and to
see how the years have shaped
our lives.
The greatest of luck to you.
