# Your Daily
## 
### 
Daring.the summer the Stanford Daily will be on a relaxed
schedule, publishing only twice a week—on Tuesdays and Fri
days, and publishing as a tabloid.
That means that the space available for news is extremely lim
ited and that many items submitted for publication will be se
verely cut.
But, and this we promise faithfully, we will try to get every
newsworthy campus item in the paper somewhere, even if it's
just a whispered mention.
In attempting to cover the news during the summer, the Daily
will try diligently to cover all significant items, both on campus
and off. We'll continue to use United Press dispatches describ
ing the dramatic in national and world news.
It's our belief that the Daily should offer as much national and
international news as possible without slighting local coverage.
It's our opinion too that the Daily should offer as much sound
editorial comment on world happenings as is possible, consider
ing the editor's limited experience and understanding.
If you have any gripes or suggestions please feel free to drop
by the "Shack" (located next to the Press Building) or to write a
"Letter to the Editor." After all, the Daily is supposed to be the
campus newspaper, your newspaper. And you have as much
right to express an opinion as the editor sitting at his rather bat
tered desk pecking at a typewriter at which even the junk man
would sneer.—Hadley Rott
