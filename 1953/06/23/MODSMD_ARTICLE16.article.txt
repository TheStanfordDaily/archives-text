# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Sunday, June 14 . . . I'm sitting here in Frost Amphitheater, properly
capped and gowned, and it's hot as hell.
And as I sit here I'm thinking about a lot of things. I'm thinking about
this diploma I'm holding in my hand. It's real and all that, but, damn,
(if I don't feel stupid. It seems that not until you hold one of these parch
ments do you realize how much there still is to learn. #
And I am thinking about the members of the dying Class of '53 who
ore on the brink of being collegiate has-beens. For 1(5 years of their lives

they've been going to school. And for 16 years of
their lives they've been used to three months of vaca- .
tion. That's all over now. Within a few hours, they !
will go their several ways. Some will be going to Los '
Angeles, some to New York, San Francisco, London,
Davenport, lowa, Seattle, Hong Kong, Chicago. Some '
will shortly be in the middle of basic training, some ;
will be housewives, and some will be sitting in a (
stuffy office, getting two weeks* vacation a year, j
A short time ago they were exchanging friendly \
hello's on Quad, but in a few hours they'll be scat
tered by the four winds. They'll return for reunions

in the years to come, but it will never be quite the same.
And I am thinking about some of my individual classmates. There's
Barbara over there. She was my first date at Stanford. She's married and
has a baby now. Bob's just getting his diploma from Dr. Sterling. He's
got his future all cut out. He went Phi Bete. He'll go to biz school,
eventually take over his father's business, and probably become a mil
lionaire, or close to it.
Bdl is sitting up there in the front row. Don't see how he ever made
st. I think he went plus one for his four years. He'll probably sponge off
his father's money and die a pauper.
And there's Chris, one of my best friends, just getting his diploma.
Good man. He wants to go into Point Four work in South America. Right
now, he's army-bound. Wonder if I'll ever see him again.
Ann's a couple rows behind me there. Great gal. Wonder what will
become of her.
Pretty soon, we'll sing "Hail, Stanford, Hail." Rev. Minto will give the
benediction, and then we'll be whisked off by an attack of congratulating
relatives. And it'll be all over.
But I just can't h速lp wondering what's going to happen to my friends
in the Class of '53. For it's not the place, but the people who have meant
Stanford to me.
Damn, but it's hot out here.

Davenport, lowa, Seattle, Hong Kong, Chicago. Some '
will shortly be in the middle of basic training, some ;
will be housewives, and some will be sitting in a (
stuffy office, getting two weeks* vacation a year, j
A short time ago they were exchanging friendly \
hello's on Quad, but in a few hours they'll be scat
tered by the four winds. They'll return for reunions

in the years to come, but it will never be quite the same.
And I am thinking about some of my individual classmates. There's
Barbara over there. She was my first date at Stanford. She's married and
has a baby now. Bob's just getting his diploma from Dr. Sterling. He's
got his future all cut out. He went Phi Bete. He'll go to biz school,
eventually take over his father's business, and probably become a mil
lionaire, or close to it.
Bdl is sitting up there in the front row. Don't see how he ever made
st. I think he went plus one for his four years. He'll probably sponge off
his father's money and die a pauper.
And there's Chris, one of my best friends, just getting his diploma.
Good man. He wants to go into Point Four work in South America. Right
now, he's army-bound. Wonder if I'll ever see him again.
Ann's a couple rows behind me there. Great gal. Wonder what will
become of her.
Pretty soon, we'll sing "Hail, Stanford, Hail." Rev. Minto will give the
benediction, and then we'll be whisked off by an attack of congratulating
relatives. And it'll be all over.
But I just can't h速lp wondering what's going to happen to my friends
in the Class of '53. For it's not the place, but the people who have meant
Stanford to me.
Damn, but it's hot out here.

Sunday, June 14 . . . I'm sitting here in Frost Amphitheater, properly
capped and gowned, and it's hot as hell.
And as I sit here I'm thinking about a lot of things. I'm thinking about
this diploma I'm holding in my hand. It's real and all that, but, damn,
(if I don't feel stupid. It seems that not until you hold one of these parch
ments do you realize how much there still is to learn. #
And I am thinking about the members of the dying Class of '53 who
ore on the brink of being collegiate has-beens. For 1(5 years of their lives

they've been going to school. And for 16 years of
their lives they've been used to three months of vaca- .
tion. That's all over now. Within a few hours, they !
will go their several ways. Some will be going to Los '
Angeles, some to New York, San Francisco, London,
Davenport, lowa, Seattle, Hong Kong, Chicago. Some '
will shortly be in the middle of basic training, some ;
will be housewives, and some will be sitting in a (
