# Dekes Suspended Until Fall '54
## 
### 
The Dekes, Delta Kappa Epsilon
fraternity, began their five-quarter
suspension from the campus last
week because of violations of Uni
versity liquor regulations last
month.
University officials said the Dekes
would be reinstated Sept. 15, 1954,
shortly before the opening of the
1954 autumn quarter.
Dr. Wallace Sterling, Stanford
president, cited the fraternity's
"long-standing record of failure to
contribute constructively to the
welfare of the University," and
warned that a relapse after the
chapter is reinstated could result in
termination of the group's charter.
The Dekes are the second frater
nity to be suspended this year. Last
April the Sigma Nu chapter was
suspended until Dec. 18. also on
charges of a liquor regulation vio
lation.
