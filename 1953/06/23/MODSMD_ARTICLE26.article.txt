Bob Murphy, stellar Stanford
pitcher last year, made his debut
with Oakland Acorns last Sunday
afternoon a successful one. He
hurled the Oaks to a 3-2 decision
over the Portland Beavers.
Murphy, who signed with the
Oakland organization for $3,999, had
an 11-2 and two overall record with
the Cards last season. In CIBA
play, he established an amazing 8-1
mark.
