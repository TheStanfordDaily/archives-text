# Excom Holds First Meet of Quarter
## 
### 
Three new activities — a na
tional horse show, a summer
quarter outdoor concert, and
discussions on academic free
dom—were suggested and dis
cussed at the first meeting of the
summer quarter Executive Com
mittee of the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University
Wednesday night. t
A special three-man subcommit
tee of Excom was appointed by
President Fran. Kirk to study the
possibility of holding a full-scale
national horse show on campus in
the fall. Those appointed to the
committee were: Martin Perlber
ger, representing graduate students,
who will serve as chairman; Martin
Armbruster, men's halls; and Jane
Woods, Associated Women Stu
dents.
The horse show question, which
)ia!> apparently received strenuous
consideration by the University
administration, was raised by
Fran Kirk who had discussed the
matter with Dean Donald Win
bigler that afternoon.
Kirk reported that the project
was first mentioned toward the close
of spring quarter by freshman Mar
garet Shank and that she had car
ried the idea to several members of
the administration and had received
favorable reaction.
M iss Shank's plan, according to
Kirk, calls for a national profes
sional horseshow to be held on cam
pus Oct. 2*,} to 24. Miss Shank, the
president quoted Dean Winbigler as
saying, has contacted professional
equestrians willing to participate in
the show.
Kirk said he has gained the im
pression after talking with several
members of the administration that
these officials are generally in favor
of such a project. The only draw
backs they see. he said, are finding
a substantial financial underwriter
dn case the project fails and build
ling a proper show ring.
Miss Woods, one of the mem
bers of the study committee,
voiced some reluctance about the
project. She cited the difTiculty
encountered by other groups in
the Bay Area which had attempt
ed to put on a show of national
scope. #
Academic freedom, a hot subject
on campus toward the close of last
quarter, was fjut forward by Kirk
who sought the opinion of represen
tatives on the possibility of organiz
ing discussions on the question. It
was suggested that Excom try to
sample student opinion cm the mat
ter during the week.
Though no official vote was ta
ken, it seemed the general consen
sus of the group that some action
toward promoting discussion on the
tissue be taken by Excom.
The idea of having an outdoor
concert sometime during the sum

mcr was suggested to the group
by Vice - President Lucie Wells.
She said she had discussed the
proposal with a number of sum
mer students and had found most
of them enthusiastic.
She reported she had advanced
the idea to Professor Sandor Salgo
of the Music Department. The pro
fessor, she said, had offered to form
a symphonic group.
Excom approved the whole
heartedly, though they withheld ap
proval of any particular date for the
event. Miss Wells was asked by
Kirk to look further into the matter.
In other action, Excom appropri
ated a sum "not to exceed $50" for
the Watermelon Feed scheduled for
Sunday afternoon at the Women's
Pool.
Also, the group gave approval to
a request by Mrs. Luell Guthrie, co
ordinator of -recreation for summer
quarter, to bank funds with the
ASSU.
The next meeting of Excom will
be Wednesday night in the ASSU
committee room on the second floor
of the Nitery.
