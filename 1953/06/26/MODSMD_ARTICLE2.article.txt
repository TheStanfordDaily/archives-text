TOKYO. Friday, June 2(i (UP)—
Chinese Communists hurled 10.000
to 15,000 troops against South Ko
rean positions on both the eastern
and western fronts last night, but
at dawn today Ihe tough ROK de
fenders were holding fast.
I
South Korean infantrymen, fight
ing back against the Reds' third an
niversary attack, had trapped and
surrounded a regiment of some 3,- J
000 Chinese.
Some 10.000 Reds hit UOK j;«»-
sitions on the western front ami a
regiment or more—3,ooo to 5,000—
slammed into South Koreans near
Capitol Hill in the east.
ROKs at Capitol Hill were re
ported to have let the Reds pene- ;
trate their front-line positions and
then surrounded them. "We shut
the gate behind them," a spokesman
said.
Again the Chinese picked South
Korean units as targets for their
punishing drives. All Red attacks
since South Korea rebelled against
an armistice agreement have hit
ROK positions.
