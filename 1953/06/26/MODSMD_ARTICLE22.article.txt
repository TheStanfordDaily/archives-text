# 'FRENCH POLICY IN NORTH AFRICA'
## Sub-Prefect From Algeria Speaks at Hoover 
### BOB REZAK 
Henri Mourer, sub-prefect of the
Constantino District of Algeria,
spoke both informally and frankly
yesterday on problems in Algeria—
problems in which he considered
the French open to criticism.
In a talk on "French Policy in
North Africa," Mourer told a group
of nearly 30 persons in Hoover Li
brary that "big landowners are
stopping any actual social progress

in Algeria."
This group, Mourer said, is pow
erful politically and maintains in- j
fluential pressure groups in Paris
and in the French Civil Service.
"Another problem where the
French might he criticized, he
said, was the "undue pressure on
some elections to secure favorable
results." Such results, he said,
tend to give a "feeling of mis
trust" between the French Euro-

peans and the Moslems in North
Africa.
He noted that in the area of poli
tics, Algeria has been "quiet" and
"calm" and is marked by co-opera
tion between the French and Mos
lems.
Peacefulness on the political
scene, Mourer indicated, was due
largely to a new Statute of Algeria
which was put into effect in 1946.
The statute provides for an Algerian

Assembly — actually an Algerian
parliament, Mourer said—composed
of t>o Europeans and (»0 Moslems.
And, Mourer noted, "more and
more branches of the local civil
service are being occupied by
French Moslems.
Economic, conditions are a key
problem facing Algeria today,
Mourer observed.
