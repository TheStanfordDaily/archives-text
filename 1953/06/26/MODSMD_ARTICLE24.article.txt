# We Salute You, Ike
## 
### 
President Eisenhower, we congratulate you. You have finally
stood up and answered, in some measure, the irresponsible, dan
gerous and powerful contentions of the junior Senator from Wis-
Joseph McCarthy.
In your now famous Dartmouth speech, you slammed the "book
burners," that league of suspicious "super-patriots" headed by
McCarthy. You punched them hard.
You said:
"Don't join the book burners. Don't think you are going to con
ceal faults by concealing evidence that they [the Communists]
ever existed. Don't be afraid to go in your library and read every
book as long as any document does not offend your own ideas of
decency. That should be the only censorship.
"How will we defeat communism unless we know what it is?
»"Vhat it teaches—why does it have such an appeal for men?
Why are so many people swearing allegiance to it? It's almost
a religion, albeit of the nether regions.
"New we have got to fight it with something better. Not try
io conceal the thinking of our own people. They are part, of
A nerica and even if they think ideas that are contrary to ours
ihey have a right to have them, a right to record them and a right
to have them in places where they are accessible to others. It
is unquestioned cr it is not America."
r j hough you didn't mention the Senator by name; your reference
wa:; obvious. For it has been the Senator from Wisconsin and his
•investigating committee who have been loudest in demanding a
purge of controversial (note not necessarily communist) books
irom U. S. overseas libraries.
And, like you, Mr. President, we feel that such a purge is wrong.
Foi we believe, as you stated, that we can only learn of commu-
Dism, its tricks and tactics, by a study of its literature.
We further contend that only by allowing the free inter-flow of
ideas can we keep our own democratic faith fresh and healthy.
Democracy derives its living strength, after all, through the syn
thesis of many ideas.
Senator McCarthy and his camp have tried determinedly to
choke off many ideas, some of which, on examination, reveal no
communist content but rather are expressions of a liberal view
point. And McCarthy had proceeded largely unreprimanded un
til your strong speech, M,r. Eisenhower.
Many books have been removed from library shelves. Among
ihe books purged were those critical of McCarthy. To criticize
McCarthy, or "Low Blow loe," to use a phrase coined by Stanford's
professor Thomas A. Bailey, certainly does not mean one is a
Communist.
It seems apparent that McCarthy, by his insistence on book burn
ing and* censorship, reveals a fundamental lack of faith in the
people and their ability to sort ideas discriminatingly, which, of
course, is the basis of the democratic process. /
We salute you, President Eisenhower, for your courageous
stand. Your words at Dartmouth should be marked and hailed
by e\ery American who believes, as Thomas Jefferson did, that
" error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to
combat it."

We salute you, President Eisenhower, for your courageous
stand. Your words at Dartmouth should be marked and hailed
by e\ery American who believes, as Thomas Jefferson did, that
" error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to
combat it."
President Eisenhower, we congratulate you. You have finally
stood up and answered, in some measure, the irresponsible, dan
gerous and powerful contentions of the junior Senator from Wis-
Joseph McCarthy.
In your now famous Dartmouth speech, you slammed the "book
burners," that league of suspicious "super-patriots" headed by
McCarthy. You punched them hard.
You said:
"Don't join the book burners. Don't think you are going to con
ceal faults by concealing evidence that they [the Communists]
ever existed. Don't be afraid to go in your library and read every
book as long as any document does not offend your own ideas of
decency. That should be the only censorship.
"How will we defeat communism unless we know what it is?
»"Vhat it teaches—why does it have such an appeal for men?
Why are so many people swearing allegiance to it? It's almost
a religion, albeit of the nether regions.
"New we have got to fight it with something better. Not try
io conceal the thinking of our own people. They are part, of
A nerica and even if they think ideas that are contrary to ours
ihey have a right to have them, a right to record them and a right
to have them in places where they are accessible to others. It
is unquestioned cr it is not America."
r j hough you didn't mention the Senator by name; your reference
wa:; obvious. For it has been the Senator from Wisconsin and his
•investigating committee who have been loudest in demanding a
purge of controversial (note not necessarily communist) books
irom U. S. overseas libraries.
And, like you, Mr. President, we feel that such a purge is wrong.
Foi we believe, as you stated, that we can only learn of commu-
Dism, its tricks and tactics, by a study of its literature.
We further contend that only by allowing the free inter-flow of
ideas can we keep our own democratic faith fresh and healthy.
Democracy derives its living strength, after all, through the syn
thesis of many ideas.
Senator McCarthy and his camp have tried determinedly to
choke off many ideas, some of which, on examination, reveal no
communist content but rather are expressions of a liberal view
point. And McCarthy had proceeded largely unreprimanded un
til your strong speech, M,r. Eisenhower.
Many books have been removed from library shelves. Among
ihe books purged were those critical of McCarthy. To criticize
McCarthy, or "Low Blow loe," to use a phrase coined by Stanford's
professor Thomas A. Bailey, certainly does not mean one is a
Communist.
It seems apparent that McCarthy, by his insistence on book burn
ing and* censorship, reveals a fundamental lack of faith in the
people and their ability to sort ideas discriminatingly, which, of
course, is the basis of the democratic process. /
