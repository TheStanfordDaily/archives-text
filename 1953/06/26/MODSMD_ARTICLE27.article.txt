# ALUMNI CONFAB TALK
## Stanford History Prof Says McCarthy 'Harms Democracy More Than Commies' 
### 
Professor Thomas A. Bailey, at
the 21st Annual Stanford Alumni
Conference held on campus Ma\
31, delivered what we feel was a
very significant speech. He dis
cussed the current Republican
administration and Senator Mc-
Carthy and McCarthyism. His re
marks stirred much reaction, most
of which has been favorable. At
the conclusion of his talk he re
ceived a standing ovation.
We feci that particular portions
of his speech are of special im
portance. They are reprinted be
low.
THE EDITOR

"There are many sinister paral
| lels between the rise of Senator Mc
i Carthy and the rise of Adolph Hit
ler.
"McCarthy's irresponsible attacks
on the public service have brought
1 demoralization at home and disre
nute abroad. It is my considered
judgment that McCarthy has done
far more harm to the democratic
cause than all the so-called Coiru
munists he has run out of govern
j ment.
"What shall it profit a nation if,
to preserve its democracy, it
adopts tactics that destroy democ
racy?
"The stock reply is that McCarthy
has done some good. So did the
man who burned down his barn to
'.;ct rid of the rats."
"Thus far President Eisenhower
has not shown the aggressive lead
ership of which he is capable and
which the American people are ex
pecting of him.
"Eisenhower's chief difliculty is
in getting the isolationist and in
ternationalist wings of the Re
publican party to flap together.
Thus far he has secured, in a
number of instances, more effec
tive support from the Democrats
than from his own party.
"The rearmament of Western
Europe under NATO is hogging
down badly, and the Soviets are

evidently widening the gap of
their military superiority. History
may yet record that Eisenhower
could have served both his coun

1 try and the Western world better
by staying on as NATO coin
inander.
"A go-it-alone policy in either
Europe or Asia is fraught with dan
ger. We need allies, if for no other
reason than we need their bases and
, raw materials."
* Hi i|l
"The stalemate in Korea can be
broken, short of a complete Ameri
can withdrawal, only by surrender
ing to Communist demands or wid
ening the theater of combat activ
ity. The most hopeful way of im
proving our position without risk is
to train as large a South Korean
army as is feasible. But even this
will cost much money.
"Enlarging the Korean war is
fraught with danger, bloodshed, and
uncertainty. Assuming that we can
drive through present Communist
i lines with bloody success, we can
j easily develop a stalemate 011 the
Yalu, under conditions less favor-
I able than those at present. In this
J case we would have long and vul
| nerable lines and face large Chi
-1 nese armies on their own soil."'
