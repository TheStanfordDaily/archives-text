Stanford's varsity golf team,
ivith pressure - playing Grant
Spaeth showing the way, swept
:o a long-awaited and much-cov
eted national team champion
ship last Tuesday at the Broad
more Country Club in Colorado
Springs.
The goiters ended a four - year
reign of North Texas State as team
golf champion of the Natioanl Col
:egiate Athletic Association. Stan
ford's winning score, the total of its
four lowest - scoring players, was
578, two strokes better than run
ner-up North Carolina.
Spaeth, at his best in post-season
tournaments, fired rounds of 71 and
68 for a one-under-pat* 139 over a
rugged (i.622 - yard par - 70 course.
Warren Dailey, who specializes in
hitting a long ball, shot a 71-70—
141 over the 36 - hole route. The
two other members of the winning
team were Fred Brown and Stu
Ledbetter with scores of 147 and 151
respectively.
Merle Backlund, husky slugger
from Colorado U., took medalist
honors with a record-breaking 137.
The first round of match play
in the 56th NCAA golf tourna
ment, played Wednesday, turned
out to he a sad one for the newly
crowned champs. Only Fred
Brown managed to survive the
round, as he upset tournament
favorite Kddic Mcrrins of Loui
siana state, three and two.
Grant Spaeth, whose qualifying
round was second only to Back
lund's, was upended by Benny
Castloo ol North Texas State one up
on the 20th hole. Dailey, rated by
many the Pacific Coast's top colle
giate match player, was upset by
Tom Matey of Notre Dame, 3 and 2.
Ledbetter was eliminated by Graham
Mackey of Texas by an identical
scorefl Medalist Backlund also was
ousted in a first round character
ized by numerous upsets.
Art Schroeder shot 152 and Bob
Blackburn 155 to round out the
Card attack.
The team victory marked the
sixth time the Cards have gath
ered an NCAA championship.
They v won in 1938, 1939, 1941 and
1942 (when they tied with LSL')
and 194(». This marked the first
time that a team coached by Bud
Finger lias won the title, although
Finger played for the 1939 and
1941 champs.
Stanford can look forward to a
Jong period of domination of the na
tional golf scene. Spaeth will re
turn next year and Brown and Dai
ley are only sophomores. In addi
tion, the frosh team was very pow
erful.


STEADY FREDDY—Fred Brown, as of Wednesday, the only
Card golfer still in the battle for the National Collegiate individ
ual golf title. Brown and his mates won the team title Tuesday.
