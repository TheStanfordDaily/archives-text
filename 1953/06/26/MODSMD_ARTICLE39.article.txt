# WHITE SOX 'HOCUS POCUS'
## 
### 
NEW YORK, June 25 (UP)â€”The
whizzing White Sox used a catcher,
a third baseman, a pitcher, and an
outfielder at first base today and
added a little more hocus-pocus at
bat to hand the Yankees their fourth
straight defeat, 4-2, behind the five
hit hurling of Billy Pierce.
