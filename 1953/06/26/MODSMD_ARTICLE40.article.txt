## Summer Mural Program 
### 
(Editor's note: Larry Cahn, former sports editor of the Daily, is cur
rently acting sports editor of the Palo Alto Times.)
Thi.s one isn't for you women.
Men, how would you like to organize an intramural league this sum
mer? Never before at summer sessions has the University felt that inter
est warranted having such a program.
We feel that a limited mural program would attract enough males to
make such activity worth while, a good form of relaxation and enjoyable.
The program would necessarily be limited by the number of males
enrolled and those that showed sufficient interest. But it is plausible that
we could swing a softball and volleyball league with a track meet or swim
meet or both to wind up the festivities sometime in early August.
It is up to individual units to band together and form their own teams.
The University cannot be expected to loot the biU for,such activity as not
only is it a full-time, salaried job to organize intramurals but the cost of
officiating and equipment is such that the University cannot undertake the
program.
It interest is sufficient, and we'll know if it is only through formed
teams letting us hear about it, then the Daily will take upon itself the
task of organizing a mural program for the summer months.
We can make out of it what you men want. II you would rather just
have faculty-student exhibitions in various sports, or other special con
tests, let us know, but whatever you want in the form of mural activity
let us in on it, and we'll arrange schedules and do our best to get equip
ment and supplies.
All University athletic facilities will be available for student use. The
golf course is one of the most beautiful in the country, also one of the
most difficult. Reasonable rates prevail for Stanford students. University
tennis courts are open, as are pools during certain hours. The Men's Gym
will provide an outlet for boxing, gymnastics, or basketball workouts.
Angell Field is an excellent running track. Horses can be rented from
the stables, volleyball courts are located at men's dorms and a set of
three are located behind the Men's Gym. There are horseshoe pits outside
o!' the gym. And there are numerous grass fields for just throwing foot
balls or playing anything.
You'll find Stanford to have a complete athletic setup, one of the
finest in the country.
In areas off campus, there are bowling alleys, ice skating and roller
skating palaces, miniature golf ranges, golf driving ranges, and a baseball
batting range.
Your summer doesn't have to be athletically inept. There are countless
facilities at your disposal. And if you want an intramural program, let
us know about it real quick like.
