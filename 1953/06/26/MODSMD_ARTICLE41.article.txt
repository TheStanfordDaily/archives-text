# Crew Beaten At Syracuse
## 
### 
It was a sorry Saturday, the 20th
of June, for the orphaned darlings
ot Stanford, the varsity crew, who
went back east to Lake Onandoga
at Syracuse, New York, with high
hopes of a strong finish in the annual
Intercollegiate Rowing Regatta. The
varsity eight never got started and
trailed home last, far behind the
winning shell of last year's Olym
pic champions, Navy. Cornell fin
ished a surprising second, with
Washington's Huskies a half length
behind in third place.
