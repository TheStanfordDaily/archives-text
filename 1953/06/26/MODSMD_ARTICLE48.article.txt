# Stanford Names Atom-Smasher Lab In Honor of Its Founder, Dr. Hansen
## 
### 
The Stanford laboratory that
houses the world's biggest elec
tron linear accelerator and most
powerful radio tubes has been
reorganized and renamed the W.
W. Hansen Laboratories of Phys
ics in honor of the man who
smarted it all.
The late William Webster Hansen,
professor of physics, was respon
sible for the founding of the Stan
lord Microwave Laboratory in 1945.
He gathered about him a group of
scientists and with them developed
a leading center of microwave elec
tronic research. He died in 1949 at
the age of 39.
Announcement of the reorganiza
tion came from Stanford President
Wallace Sterling, who said the Han
sen Laboratories will consist of two
divisions.
One is the Microwave Laboratory
under its present director, Dr. Ed
ward L. Ginzton. The other is the
High Energy Physics Laboratory,
■with Dr. W. K. H. Panofsky as di
rector.
Tlu* new High Energy Physics
Laboratory has the responsibility
for operation of the billion-volt
linear accelerator, and ultimately
will take over the present Micro
wave Laboratory building.
Meantime, however, the Micro
wave Laboratory will continue to
occupy space in its present building.
Plans for construction of additional
space to house the Microwave Lab
oratory in new quarters are being
drawn up.
The reorganization was initiated
by Dr. Ginzton. lie pointed out
thai microwave development work
on the accelerator is complete and.
although some construction work
remains to be done, it is already
being used by the high energy
physicists in nuclear experiments.
The Stanford team which discov
ered the klystron was headed by
Professor David L. Webster. Mem
bers were Dr. Hansen and the Var
ian brothers, Sigurd and Russell.
They were aided by Dr. Ginzton and
Dr. J. R. Woodyard in development
work.
The accelerator is one of the most
powerful atom - smashers in the
world. Its eventual strength of one
billion electron volts can be equaled
by only one other smasher in the
world, the giant cosmotron -at
Brookhaven National Laboratory in
New York.
At peak operation the 21 electron
tubes powering the accelerator use
enough electricity to light the city
of San Francisco.


THE BIG GUN—W. A. Grimshaw, research engineer, changes
the wiring of a klystron package unit. Klystrons, powerful radio
tubes, furnish the "kick" needed to shoot electrons through the
giant atom smasher located in Stanford's newly renamed Han
sen Laboratory.

ered the klystron was headed by
Professor David L. Webster. Mem
bers were Dr. Hansen and the Var
ian brothers, Sigurd and Russell.
They were aided by Dr. Ginzton and
Dr. J. R. Woodyard in development
work.
The accelerator is one of the most
powerful atom - smashers in the
world. Its eventual strength of one
billion electron volts can be equaled
by only one other smasher in the
world, the giant cosmotron -at
Brookhaven National Laboratory in
New York.
At peak operation the 21 electron
tubes powering the accelerator use
enough electricity to light the city
of San Francisco.


THE BIG GUN—W. A. Grimshaw, research engineer, changes
the wiring of a klystron package unit. Klystrons, powerful radio
tubes, furnish the "kick" needed to shoot electrons through the
giant atom smasher located in Stanford's newly renamed Han
sen Laboratory.
