WASHINGTON, June 25 (IP)â€”
The State Department announced
today it is preparing a new direc
tive to replace Secretary John
Foster Dulles' much-criticized or
der banning certain books from
U.S. overseas libraries,
Robert L. Johnson, head of the
International Information Pro
gram. told a news conference ex
isting instructions barring l>ooks
by Communists or fellow travel
ers "have led to confusion."
Johnson said the American
principle that an individual is in
nocent until proven guilty has
made it almost impossible for the
department to provide its field
staff with a complete list of au
thors whose works should be ex
cluded from the foreign informa
tion libraries.
