# Reds Nix U.N. Truce Plea: Clark Labeled ‘Insincere’

### 
TOKYO, Tuesday, June 30 (UP)—A United Nations offer to sign
a Korean armistice and use force if necessary to keep South Korea
in line was rejected today by the official North Korean radio.
Radio Pyongyang said Gen. Mark W. Clark's letter to the Com
munist high command "shows no sincere desire for an armistice

in Korea and proves that the
present situation has been creat
ed through a conspiracy of the
United States and the Syrigman
Rhee government."
The Pyongyang broadcast, first
Red reaction to Clark's offer, came
as President Eisenhower's personal
truce envoy met for the fifth time
with Rhee at the presidential man
sion in Seoul. Assistant Secretary
o! State Walter Robertson arrived
at the presidential mansion at 9:30
a.m. (5:30 p.m. Monday PDT).
Rhee and Robertson were re
ported deadlocked in their "little
truce talks" over some important
final details of a formula that
could end Rhee's opposition to an
armistice.
Radio Pyongyang said Clark's let
ter showed that Rhee's action in re
leasing 27,000 anti-Communist North
Korean prisoners "was an intrigue
carried out to wreck the prisoner
agreement and block the achieve
ment of an armistice."
