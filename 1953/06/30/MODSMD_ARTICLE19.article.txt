# Summer Sports Chatter

### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
It's summertime. College athletics are at a practical standstill. The
lads who wear the red and white for nine months of the year are doing
their sweating elsewhere, on a construction job, perhaps, or in an ROTC
summer camp
Occasionally one hears of some individual endeavor by an Injun ath
lete. Someone may finish well in a prominent golf tournament or some
body else may win a yachting race. The point is, however, there is very
little going on in the Stanford athletic scene during the summer and there
is even less to write about.
STANFORD SPORT BIiIEFS
Demotion: Jack Shepparrl, recently demoted by Pittsburgh to Denver
ol the Class A Pioneer League, will be back in the majors, we hope. Stan
lord Baseball Coach Everett Dean thinks Jack is probably the best pros
pect ever to hit the Farm. Hard to believe: Grant Spaeth in the recent
NCAA golf tournament used but one drive and one seven iron to reach
the green on the 58(>-yard seventeenth hole at the Broadmore course.
A brilliant start: Bob Murphy has looked very good on the mound in
his first two assignments for the Oakland Acorns,
Minor miracle: The Chronicle's Will Connolly had a whole column's
worth of quotes on Chuck Essegian, strong and silent recent addition to
the Sacramento Solons. Don Liebendorfer, Stanford's Athletic Publicity
Director, says, "Getting a word out of Chuck is like getting a word out
of a wall."
