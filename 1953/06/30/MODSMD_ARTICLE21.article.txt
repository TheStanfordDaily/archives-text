# Stanford Enjoys Fun-Full Weekend
## 
### 
Anything more fun than a water
melon feed? Summer quarter stu
dents who joined in Sunday's "Wa
termelon Feast and Splash Party"
apparently don't think so.
Mountains ol watermelon were
consumed and students participated
in energetic games of volleyball and
baseball as well as "splashing" in
tlie Women's Pool.
