Never in our memory has a quarter gotten off to such a bang-up
social start as this one. Lucie Welles, vice-president of the Asso
ciated Students for the summer, who is specifically charged with
Stanford's social calendar, and her committees and helpers de
serve a great big "thank you."
Three huge social events within a week, that is a full week in
anyone's language. And they all went off wonderfully, the recep
tion last Wednesday, the dance Saturday, and the Watermelon
feast and splash party Sunday.
Planning for summer quarter is a tenuous business. It must be
started during the early part of spring quarter, if not before, when
summer enrollment is still a cloudy guess in the Registrar's mind.
And it must consider the tastes of the many graduate students
here for the quarter. j
Miss Welles' planning, however, has demonstrated foresight
and good sense.
