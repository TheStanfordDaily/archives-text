# The 						Daily's Been Duped
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I was extremely shocked and disappointed to read that our own
Stanford Daily has been sucked in by those egghead-leftwingers as
witnessed by your editorial of Friday, June 26, "We Salute You,
Ike." This editorial disseminates the base canard that our beloved
Leader, General Eisenhower, is against the book-burners, and that
he is especially opposed to that master of anti-Communist propa
ganda, Senator Joseph McCarthy.
It's inconceivable that our Leader would be so brash as to try
to combat Senator McCarthy, for the Senator gives every sign of
becoming our Leader in the future if he can just deport all of those
egghead-leftwingers.
If the editor of The Daily had just read the newspapers between
quarters, he would not have been fooled by this left-wing propa
ganda. On June 17 the Palo Alto Times printed an AP dispatch
irom Washington which clearly showed that our Leader's speech
at Dartmouth College was ghostwritten by some egghead who
had infiltrated our great Businessman's Administration, for at his
press conference on June 17 our Leader unequivocally repudiated
his unwitting speech at Dartmouth. I quote from AP.
"President Eisenhower said today it is all right with him if the
State Department burns books which openly appeal for the Com
munist way of life.
"Eisenhower declined to say whether his attack on book burn
ing in a speech at Dartmouth College Sunday was aimed at Sena
tor McCarthy (R. Wis.).
"The President said he was against the government stocking
books abroad which would contribute to the destruction of the
United States."
This should be a lesson to the editor, and make him think twice
before he takes anything that our Leader says at face value, for
there's a great chance that our Leader may have been duped by
leftwingers. This, of course, isn't our Leader's fault, for his job is
a dreadfully trying one as evidenced by the number of times he
has to get away from it by playing goif.

(EDITORS NOTE: Though President Eisenhower did say in his
press conference of June 17 that he didn't care if hooks advocating the
overthrow of the American government were purged, he did not back
down on the essential points of his Dartmouth College addressâ€”that
hooks on Communist theory should be available for study and that hooks
of merely controversial nature should remain on library shelves whether
at home or overseas.)
