# NOTES MANY ANCIENT MOSSES
## Farm Prof Studies Arctic Plant Life 
### 
A long - standing question
among botanists — whether the
Arctic Circle has any distinct
lower plant life—can now be
answered. It has.
A Stanford University botanist,
Professor William C. Steere, collect
ed the proof during two exploration
trips around the northernmost tip
of Alaska, Point Barrow.
Moreover, a considerable number

| of the plants are of extremely an
| cient origin, he believes. And al
i though they survive the fierce cold
| and nine or ten months of each year
| in solidly frozen ground, they are
I related to tropical and subtropical
plants of Asia rather than to those
of slightly warmer regions nearby
to the south.
I)r. Steere and his associate at
Stanford, I)r. Howard A. Crum,
| have just left on another trip to
Alaska in search of more mosses,
lie has confined his study to this
lower class of plants because their
distribution — if weedy varieties

are excepted—is typical of most
! plants.
The previous summer studies in
j Alaska have been supported by
| contracts with the Office of Naval
Research. This summer's expedition
will be sponsored by the National
Science Foundation and the Arctic
Institute of North America.
The scientists' base is the Arctic
Research Laboratory, whose direc
tor is another noted Stanford bota
nist, Professor Ira L. Wiggins. The
laboratory is located at Barrow, on
the Arctic Ocean.
The "arctic wastes" are really not
wastelands at all, says Dr. Steere,
but more like a prairie with grasses
a foot high. Occasional willows, ten
feet tall, are the only trees. Herds
of caribou, moose, and mountain
goats manage to subsist throughout
the year on the vegetation.
Dr. Steere's investigations fill a
considerable gap in the botanical
I knowledge of mosses of the Arctic,
| which was previously based on
j scattered explorations in Spitzber
j gen, Siberia, and northern Canada.
