# We Salute You, Ike—II

### 
The zealots who prize ignorance over understanding and hys
teria over reason were scored again last week, and again by,
perhaps, the most powerful single political voice in America,
President Eisenhower.
In a significant and powerfully phrased letter to the annual
conference of the American Library Association meeting last
week in Los Angeles, the President reaffirmed his now much
hailed Dartmouth speech. He defended the people's right to
know, to read and speak as they please. And he warned tellingly
against the "zealots" who act in the name of freedom with the
tools of tyranny.
Of democracy, he said, .. . Freedom of inquiry, freedom of
the spoken and written word, freedom of the exchange of ideas—
upon these clear principles, democracy depends for its very life,
for they are the great sources of knowledge and enlightenment.
And knowledge—full unfettered knowledge of its own heritage,
of freedom's enemies, of the whole world of men and ideas—this
knowledge is a free people's surest strength."
Of those who stand against the full exercise of such freedoms,
he said, . . there are some zealots who—with more wrath than
wisdom — would adopt a strangely unintelligent course. They
would try to defend freedom by denying freedom's friends the
opportunity of studying Communism in its entirety—its plausi
bilities, its falsities, its weaknesses."
Such "zealots" have of late gained wide influence, particularly
through the adroit leadership of Senator Joseph McCarthy (R.,
Wis.). The Senator and his worshipful clan have been particularly
strident in their demands that books "not representing the Ameri
can view" be purged from the shelves of U.S. overseas libraries.
And so far the State Department, acting with supple spine in
stead of determined intelligence, has complied with McCarthy's
wishes and has ordered the removal of reportedly more than 300
books from the shelves of the libraries.
President Eisenhower, in his Dartmouth speech, in his press
conferences, in his letter to the libraries, has indicated that he
little sympathizes with the State Department's policy regarding
the book purge.
"As it is an ancient truth that freedom cannot be legislated into
existence," he told the librarians, "so it is no less obvious that
freedom cannot be censored into existence, and any who act as
if freedom's defenses are to be found in suppression and suspi
cion and fear confess a doctrine that is alien to America."
(In an even more forthright criticism of the State Department's
book policy, the President, in a press conference Wednesday,
said mistakes have been made in the governmnt's book purge
because someone got frightened. He said that he would confer
with Secretary of State Dulles on the issue.)
President Eisenhower, within the past month, has defined the
basic tenets of democracy, the essential freedoms, and he has
defined them with vigor and intelligence. It's time now that the
nation, its people and its government, note the words and mold
them into a policy that speaks for democracy and not suppression
. . . a policy that represents the people and not the demagogues.

In a significant and powerfully phrased letter to the annual
conference of the American Library Association meeting last
week in Los Angeles, the President reaffirmed his now much
hailed Dartmouth speech. He defended the people's right to
know, to read and speak as they please. And he warned tellingly
against the "zealots" who act in the name of freedom with the
tools of tyranny.
Of democracy, he said, .. . Freedom of inquiry, freedom of
the spoken and written word, freedom of the exchange of ideas—
upon these clear principles, democracy depends for its very life,
for they are the great sources of knowledge and enlightenment.
And knowledge—full unfettered knowledge of its own heritage,
of freedom's enemies, of the whole world of men and ideas—this
knowledge is a free people's surest strength."
Of those who stand against the full exercise of such freedoms,
he said, . . there are some zealots who—with more wrath than
wisdom — would adopt a strangely unintelligent course. They
would try to defend freedom by denying freedom's friends the
opportunity of studying Communism in its entirety—its plausi
bilities, its falsities, its weaknesses."
Such "zealots" have of late gained wide influence, particularly
through the adroit leadership of Senator Joseph McCarthy (R.,
Wis.). The Senator and his worshipful clan have been particularly
strident in their demands that books "not representing the Ameri
can view" be purged from the shelves of U.S. overseas libraries.
And so far the State Department, acting with supple spine in
stead of determined intelligence, has complied with McCarthy's
wishes and has ordered the removal of reportedly more than 300
books from the shelves of the libraries.
President Eisenhower, in his Dartmouth speech, in his press
conferences, in his letter to the libraries, has indicated that he
little sympathizes with the State Department's policy regarding
the book purge.
"As it is an ancient truth that freedom cannot be legislated into
existence," he told the librarians, "so it is no less obvious that
freedom cannot be censored into existence, and any who act as
if freedom's defenses are to be found in suppression and suspi
cion and fear confess a doctrine that is alien to America."
(In an even more forthright criticism of the State Department's
book policy, the President, in a press conference Wednesday,
said mistakes have been made in the governmnt's book purge
because someone got frightened. He said that he would confer
with Secretary of State Dulles on the issue.)
President Eisenhower, within the past month, has defined the
basic tenets of democracy, the essential freedoms, and he has
defined them with vigor and intelligence. It's time now that the
nation, its people and its government, note the words and mold
them into a policy that speaks for democracy and not suppression
. . . a policy that represents the people and not the demagogues.
The zealots who prize ignorance over understanding and hys
teria over reason were scored again last week, and again by,
perhaps, the most powerful single political voice in America,
President Eisenhower.
