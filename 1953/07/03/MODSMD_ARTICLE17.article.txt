# Code of Ethics Governs Farm

### ROSCOE WILKEY Chairman, Men's Council 
In that personal honor plays
such a large part in the lives of
Stanford men and women, many
ordinary precautions, restric
tions, and regulations, such as
proctoring, are not necessary.
Trustworthiness and self - disci
pline have been traditional hall- ;
marks of our conduct.
The Honor Code is the basic ap- |
plication of the Fundamental Stand
ard to academic work, which was
phrased as follows by Dr. David
Starr Jordan, the first president of !
the University:
"Students are expected to show
both within and without the Uni- |
versity such respect for order, mor- [
ality, personal honor, and the rights
of others, as is demanded of good ,
citizens. Failure to do this will be
sufficient cause for removal from j
the University.''
The Honor Code is an under
taking of the students both indi
vidually and collectively, pledg
ing:
1. That they will not give or re- ;
ceive aid in examinations; that they !
will not give or receive unpermit- |
ted aid in class work, in the prepa
ration of reports, or in any other
work that may be used as the basis
of grading.
2. That they will do their share !
and take an active part, in seeing
that others as well as themselves
obey the spirit and the letter of
the Honor Code.
All infractions of the Honor Code,
reported either by faculty members
or by students, are adjudicated by
Men's Council and Women's Coun
cil, appointed by the student body
for the summer quarter. At the
time of hearing, anyone alleged to
have cheated Is given ample oppor
tunity to clear himself. There is.
however, no confrontation between
plaintiff and defendant, this being ;
in order to encourage the third
party responsibility custom.
The importance of the Honor
Code and the Fundamental Stand
ard, of which it is a part, is vital to !
the continued scholastic and moral 1
reputation of Stanford. The stu
dents have the sole responsibility of
maintaining it.
