We didn't get much action on an intramural league with only one soft- ;
1 ball team contacting us, but we took part in one of the darndest "exhibi
| tions" of softball finesse that you've ever seen..
We were over at lhe watermelon feed Sunday watching mixed vol
leyball games going through their crowded paces, when some active
individuals got to organizing a coed softball game.
Baseball is something dear to our hearts and off we went to the "dia
mond" which one girl from Boston insisted was Fenway Park.
The sides were chosen with a minimum of confusion and play was
about to start when the captains met for a discussion of ground rules.
Well, ground rules turned to eligibility and in order to equalize play
the men were ordered to bat left-handed and to throw the same way.
This made it definitely "ladies' day"and if the women had all been
on one side and the men on the other, the score would have been astro
nomical, but fortunately the sides were equally divided, or so we
thought.
But our side had a pitcher, Margie by name, who is wasting her time
in the minors. It was soon evident who would be the winner. When she
hurled they couldn't hit, and her hits they couldn't catch. When
she swung, the ball sailed to the deepest confines of the field, and even
if the fielders caught up with the rolling ball, no one had the strength.
! throwing with a left arm, or a girl's arm, to possibly get the ball back
before Margie got home.
And so it went until an ambidextrous feliow broke up the game.
Ex-Stanford ace Jack Shepard, who signed with Pittsburgh two
weeks ago and was farmed out to Denver, hit his first home run in
pro ball Tuesday and it was a good one. The blow gave Denver a win
over Pueblo of the Western League.

The PALO Club's Hole in One tourney is a good chance for any golfers
to go down and try their luck and whatever skill may be involved in
Jiitting the magic pin which is some 125 yards distant. There have been
three aces since the tourney began last Saturday. It runs until July 12.
J Six shots for a dollar, and tremendous prizes. That's down at the Penin
i sula Fairways, a bit south on El Camino.
The Stanford National championship goli team will be back intact next
year with no graduation loss.
