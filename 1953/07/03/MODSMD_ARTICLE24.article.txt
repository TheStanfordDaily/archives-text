# Hand Pumps to Engines: A Fire Department Evolves
## 
### HARRY MARTIN 
Stanford has come a long way from the old hand pumps to those '
four shiny red fire engines that now sit in the fire house.
It has been 70 years since Leland Stanford first brought a hand
pump to this area for his stock farm. Now Stanford has its own
fire department, owned and maintained by the Universityr with

a well - trained and equipped" 4
crew of students and regulars.
The fire house "'gang" is composed <
primarily of students who live there !
plus six full-time firemen.
It is the fire department's job to
handle Stanford-owned property —
which covers 9,000 acres.
The man in charge, Chief John i
M. Marston, has been leading stu
dents in the manly art of fire dous
ing for 12 years now.
Every Saturday the student
firemen drill in front of the fire

house—putting up ladders, prac
ticing dry line, wet line, driving
trucks, or running the pumps.
Recently the fire house acquired
new radio equipment that connects
the Stanford branch with the entire
Santa Clara County.
In the summer the student staff
of the fire department is not filled,
as many of the regular student
firemen are not in summer school.*
Chief Marston says that there are
a few vacancies and that any in
terested students should see him.


FIRE! —The newest of Stanford's shiny red fire engines with
the latest equipment is seen here. This truck goes out on all
calls and is equipped with a three-way radio that connects it
with the entire county.
