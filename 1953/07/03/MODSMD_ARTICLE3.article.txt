# Firemen Fight Grass Fires
## 
### 
Stanford firemen battled two rag
ing grass fires during the past week,
one yesterday and the other on
Tuesday.
Yesterday's blaze burned over
more than three acres before con
trolled by firemen from the Stan
ford and Los Altos fire departments.
The fire swept over a small hill off
Page Mill Road near Arastradero
Road.
About one acre of grass land ad
joining the dump off Pine Avenue
was blackened by fire Tuesday af
ternoon. Firemen fought for more
than 20 minutes to subdue the
flames.
Fire Chief John Marston said that
the fire apparently spread from the
dump.
