### 
Dr. Russel V. A. Leo. well-known
Palo Alto physician and president
01 the Stanford Alumni Association,
cited two paramount national health
needs in a Tuesday Evening Series
address Tuesday.
He said the nation is in need,
desperate need, of more trained
medical personnel, particularly
medical researchers, and more fa
cilities. Also, he said, there is a
need for a means to medical
services to thos<? who need them.
A way must be found, he said, to
encourage doctors to carry on medi
cal research.
"We need to develop a race of re
searcher*," he said. "We should

make careers possible for promising
medical researchers and assure them
security while they carry on a life
time of research."
He claimed that most of those
currently engaged in medical re
search are chemists or physicists
who do not have adequate medical
training.
As t'ar as facilities are con
cerned. the doctor cited the finan
cial worries of medical schools
across the country. He estimated
that American medical schools
will run a $40 million deficit this
year, and need $.'J00 million U»
bring them up to standards they
should maintain.
He mentioned state aid ?s a

source of possible relief to these
institutions but pointed to the bitter
opposition to the idea.
One of the great handicaps to
medical progress, he said, is confu
sion over the use of the term "so
cialized medicine."
''There is such a thing as social
ized medicine," he said, "and I don't
like it, but to use the term to com
bat advances in medical care is a
dangerous thing, and I think we
had better take a second look at it."
Talking of general health plans,
he said that at the moment 84 mil
lion Americans belong to some kind
of pre-paid medical plan, but added
that most of the=e plans are inade
quate.
