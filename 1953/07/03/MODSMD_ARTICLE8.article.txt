# RHEE HANDED FIRM NOTE
## Told 'Now or Never' By U.S. Special Emissary 
### 
TOKYO, Friday, July 3 (UP) â€”President Eisenhower's special
truce envoy, armed with instructions to take a "firmer" attitude,
met with South Korean President Syngman Rhee today and de
livered a written reply to Rhee's unyielding stand against a Korean
armistice.
Assistant Secretary of State Walter Robertson arrived at Rhee'3

mansion in Seoul at 10:30
(6:30 p.m. PDT Thursday). He
was accompanied by Ellis O.
Briggs, U.S. ambassador to Korea,
[ and Robert D. Murphy, Gen. Mark
W. Clark's political adviser.
Robertson delivered a written re
ply to Rhee's letter of Wednesday
in which the 78-year-old South Ko
rean president said his position on
a Korean armistice had not changed
I since his talks with the Presidential
envoy began a week ago.
Content of the letter was not
disclosed, but reliable sources said
Robertson would make it clear to
Rhee that the current talks are a
"now or never" proposition, ami
that there will he no other special
emissaries to Korea, at least not
until after a truce is signed.
It was understood that Robert
| son's new "firmer" attitude would
not be of the table-pounding vari
j ety, but that he would lay the
United States position on the line
I lor Rhee in "plain words."
Robertson was expected to make
jit clear once and for all to Rhee that
the United States and the United
] Nations are going ahead with plans
1 for a truce with or without South
Korean co-operation, as Clark stat
ed in his letter to the Communist
military leaders.
Rhee was said to be adamant in
his demands for a 90-day limit on
the political conference which is
to follow an armistice and a mu
tual security pact with the United
States.
Robertson, it was understood, was
! ready to inform Rhee that his de
mands, as stated, are unacceptable.
The United States was reported
willing to accept a time limit on the
political conference, but is firmly
opposed to Rhee's insistence that
U.N. forces start fighting the Com
munists again if the conference
shows no sign of achieving Korean
unification within the 90-day pe
riod.
