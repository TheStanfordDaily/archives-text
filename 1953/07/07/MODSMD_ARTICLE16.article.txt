# The 						Loyalty Program
## 
### 
The bungling inefficiency of the current administration's loyalty
program was revealed in its ugly nakedness with the news yester
day that a California congressman was barred as a "security risk"
from the Yucca Flats atomic testing grounds.
The congressman. Robert L. Condon, representing the Sixth
District, made up of Contra Costa and Solano counties, was ruled a
risk in May by the Atomic Energy Commission, acting on a "field
check" by the FBI.
Though the AEC as yet has issued no statement on the matter,
the recently retired chairman of the agency, Gordon Dean, has re
portedly said, sorry, "it was some sort of mistake."
That some sort of mistake could have occurred in this case, or in
any such case for that matter, seems to us, to be inexcusable. For
negligence and guess work has no place in a loyalty program
where one is dealing with a man's reputation, a fragile thing that
can be kicked down easily like sand castles, never to be rebuilt.
The dangers inherent in such a program are obvious. For in
unscrupulous hands, the loyalty machinery could be turned
against any group, any person.
It's fortunate in this case that the accused was well known and
commanded the same front-page priority for his rebuttal as his
accusers had for their charge.
But a tragic point about the loyalty program is that so many wlio
stand accused are not well enough known to secure newspaper
space for their rebuttal.
They must stand unshielded against the unchallenged whispers
oi the gossip-mongers and the blind super-patriots.
The government, in both its administrative and legislative
branches, should ponder well the present case where an elected
lepresentative of the people found himself accused, and resolve
to tighten its program, eliminating the guess work and making
clear its operating definition of "security risk."
