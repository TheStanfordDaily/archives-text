# 'I LIKE THE KIDS'
## 'Blackie' Recalls His 25 Years With Encina Basement Store 
### HARRY MARTIN 
"It's lots of work, but I have a lot of fun. I like the kids." That's !
how G. E. Black, "Blackie," of the Encina basement store, evaluates
his work.
This Thursday, Blackie will celebrate his 25th anniversary with
the Stanford Union at the Encina store.

Blackie chuckles when lie re
calls the Vow Hoys ami their
craving for chewing tobacco—the
only time when the store sold
chewing tobacco. He also remem
bers Hank Luisetti, Stanford bas
ketball immortal, who averaged
five bags of peanuts a day.
Along about the end of the quav
er Blackie receives many requests
for "No Doze" — requests that he
can't fill. But other than this, the
store can meet almost any student
request.
The store carries everything from
apple juice to soap powder. Blackk'
even sells stationery, pastry, and
peanut butter and crackers.
The freshmen haven't changed
much iti the past quarter of a
century, claims Blackie, "only
nowadays women are allowed in
the basement store." The war
brought this innovation. Before
that the frosh could wander into
the store clad in an;, attire. Other
than this, the store and itN cus
tomers haven't changed.
During the regular school year
the store does as big a business a
the Encina Commons dining hall or
breakfasts. After the first weeks oJ
the quarter the freshmen stari
sleeping in later and grabbing then
breakfast on the run.
About seven students are em
ployed during the school year for
part-time work. The store is owned
and operated by the Stanford Un
ion and Blackie is the manager—
and has been for 25 year?.


WHAT'LL YOU HAVE?—Smilingly, G. E. Black, "Blackie" to all
who know him, waits to fill your order at the Encina basement
store where he will have worked 25 years this Thursday.
