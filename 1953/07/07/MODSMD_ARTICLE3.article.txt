Former President Herbert Hoover
set aside plans for a fishing trip to
visit Stanford's Hoover Institute and
Library last week.
The ex - President spent several
hours Saturday morning in his of
fice in the famed library.
In a press conference in San
Francisco Saturday, Hoover said he
feels uprisings behind the Iron Cur
tain have "somewhat tempered" So
viet Russia's international ambi
tions.
However, Hoover is dubious about
the long-run effect of the uprisings
in Russia's satellites.
"I have never been optimistic,"
he said of the Iron Curtain coun
tries. "I don't know that this will
last.
''They will go on with infiltra
tion and conspiracy even if there
is no military aggression. But I
think they have been somewhat
tempered by recent events."
"Too few people understand the
nature of Communist intent," he
said. "If the American public had
been familiar with Communist writ
ings on their intentions, I don't think
we would have recognized Russia
in 1933. That's where we started to
go wrong."
