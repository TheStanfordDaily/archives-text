Let's look at football. At the real football—at soccer, the most popular !
sport in every country of the world, with the exception of the United ■
States and a few Caribbean islands.
This morning, we were down at the Encina pool, and we happened to
run into Leo Weinstein, instructor in both French and German, counselor
to women in the Maison Francaise, and coach of the Stanford soccer team.
We asked him about soccer.
' When people ask me in which way soccer resembles football, it makes
me very angry. They don't resemble each other in the least. Perhaps
football is distantly related to soccer, but the only similarity I can see
now, is that occasionally some guy picks up that elongated sphere and
kicks it a mile into the air. As soon as the ball comes down, any resem
blance comes to an end.
"Soccer is a fast-moving game in which there is no stopping and no
substituting. In football, though action may be furious for an instant,
it comes to a halt after the completion of each play. Even with the elimi- !
nation of the two-platoon system, there is still too much substitution in
football.
"Soccer is a gamg played exclusively with the feet and head, and speed j
and agility are all-important. Brawn and muscle constitute a good part
of the game of football, and it doesn't matter what part of the body one
uses to send somebody flying through the air.
" In soccer the ball is always out in the open, and it is easy for the
spectator to follow it. Today, the object in football is to hide the ball as
much as possible.
"Today soccer is making a comeback throughout the United States, j

Bolstered by the thousands of im- I
migrants who bring the game with
them from 'the old country.' it has
taken a strong hold in the East and
Middle West and is spreading on the I
Pacific Coast. In many Eastern col- j
leges and high schools it is a major j
.-port.
So spoke Leo Weinstein.
