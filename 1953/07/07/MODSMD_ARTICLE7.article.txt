TOKYO, Tuesday, July 7 (UP) —South Korean sources reported
today that the United States has handed Syngman Rhee a less se
vere—but still unacceptable —compromise offer on the stalemated
Korean truce.
The reports—which were greeted with open skepticism in U.S.

quarters—led to speculation that the"
South Korean president might be
conditioning his people for accept
ance of the U.N. truce terms.
Responsible sources in Seoul said
the Koreans might be planting re
ports of U.S. concessions to ease the
shock of an about-face agreement
by Rhee, who had threatened to go
it alone rather than accept the U.N.
terms.
The Koreans said President Ei
senhower's envoy, Walter S. Rob
ertson, handed Rhee a compromise
proposal Monday. They said its
terms were less severe than previ
ous plans outlined by the Assistant
Secretary of State but that Rhee
still considered it unacceptable.
