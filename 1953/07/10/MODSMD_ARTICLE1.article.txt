# Open Discussion Is Set On Academic Freedom
## 
### 
An open discussion on the
academic freedom question, a
much debated question in uni
versity circles, will be held
Tuesday, sponsored by the Ex
ecutive Committee of the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford Uni
versity.
The Executive Committee, after
considering the work of last year's
Executive Committee on the issue,
decided to take action when it was
reported that there are many stu
dents on campus interested in dis
csusing the matter.
Jane Woods, Associated Women
Students representative, and Kay
Watson, women's halls representa
tive, both reported that they knew
many interested students.
The open meeting has been ten
tatively set for the Women's Club
house for 4 p.m.
In spring quarter, the Executive
Committee voiced concern over
academic freedom and appointed
a special committee to study the
matter.
That committee held several
sessions, some of them heated, and
drew up live questions for gen
eral discussion. They were:
1. Whether or not the universities
are carrying out their community
responsibilities?
2. Should a person not be allowed
to teach because he is a Commu
nist?
Do we favor the investiga
tion of the political beliefs and af
filiations of university professors
by legislative investigating com
mittees?
4. What are the rights of stu
dents? What are the rights of pro
fessors and what arc their respon
sibilities?
5. Is there a danger—an essential
danger—to academic freedom?
These questions and others per
taining to the issue will be submit
ted at the open meeting Tuesday.
Fran Kirk will be chairman of the
session.


"SHALL WE DANCE?"—Ken Lewis and Beth Leonori enact
what, most likely, will become a familiar scene at tonight's all
campus dance at Mangini's Barn on Alpine Road. The dance,
originally scheduled for Saturday, will get underway at 8:30
and will last until 12. Admission is 50 cents and dress is casual.
The dance will be "stag," with trucks picking up women at La
gunita Court at 8:15 and again at 8:30. The Rhythm Vendors
will provide the music, and cider and doughnuts will be free.

It was the professed intent of last
year's Executive Committee to
frame some kind of statement that
would reflect student opinion on the
question.
Other business handled by the
Executive Committee at its Wed
nesday night session included the
approval of several expenditures.

ness, see page 2.

"SHALL WE DANCE?"—Ken Lewis and Beth Leonori enact
what, most likely, will become a familiar scene at tonight's all
campus dance at Mangini's Barn on Alpine Road. The dance,
originally scheduled for Saturday, will get underway at 8:30
and will last until 12. Admission is 50 cents and dress is casual.
The dance will be "stag," with trucks picking up women at La
gunita Court at 8:15 and again at 8:30. The Rhythm Vendors
will provide the music, and cider and doughnuts will be free.
