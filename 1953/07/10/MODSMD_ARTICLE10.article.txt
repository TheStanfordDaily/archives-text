Stanford students, we think, should be proud of the University's
decision to participate in the program of helping the University
erf the Philippines erect a sound and progressive educational in
stitution.
This sign of international friendship cannot help but make a
favorable impression on the people of Southeast Asia, who, at the
moment, are but tragic pawns in the Cold War contest.
Perhaps, there is not an area in the world where the desire for
education and for self and national improvement is expressed so
fervidly and with such determination as in Southeast Asia. For
here, in this area, are people desperately desirous to catch up
with the West and to assert with eguality their nationalism and
their cultures.
Provost Whitaker, in announcing the University's action, said,
"Our first hope is that our efforts may eventually bring to all these
people a full share of peaceful prosperity and contentment. But
our most reverent wish is that it may give rise to a lasting new
era of mutual understanding, sympathy, and co-operation between
Asia and America."
To this we add a very fervent "A-men."
