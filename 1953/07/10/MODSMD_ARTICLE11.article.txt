# Strayer Outlines Education Needs
## 
### W. W. ARMENTROUT 
Many superintendents in Califor
nia's public school system hesitate
to make recommendations about re
organization of local school districts
for fear of losing their jobs.
This charge was made by Dr.
George D. Strayer, authority on ed
ucational administrative research
and professor emeritus at Columbia
University, in an address to a lunch
eon meeting of Phi Delta Kappa,
men's educational fraternity, Tues
day in Encina Commons.
Dr. Strayer outlined four areas
of needed self-criticism within the
field of public education. They
wore: (1) administration of pub
lic education, particularly on the
county level within the state: (2)
profcssionalization among school
administrators; (3) methods of in
ducting teachers into the profes
sion: (4) more consideration of
the bright pupil in the public
schools.
Next Tuesday Dr. L. D. Haskey,
Dean of the School of Education at
Texas and visiting professor of edu
cation at Stanford, will address the
group.
Luncheon tickets can be obtained
in advance at the Phi Delta Kappa
cubicle on the third floor of the
School of Education building daily
for Si.
