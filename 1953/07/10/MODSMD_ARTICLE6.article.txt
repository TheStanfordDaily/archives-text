tivities.

"In view of the fact that the criminal activities of Beria directed
at undermining the Soviet state in the interests of foreign capital
have recently been reviewed," the Tass broadmast said, "the
Presidium of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet, after examining the
report of the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers, has decided:
"1. To remove L. P. Beria from the post of first deputy chair
man of the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers and from the post oi
U.S.S.R. Minister for Home Affairs.
"2. The case on the criminal activities of L. P. Beria is to be
handed over for examination to the Supreme Court of the U.S.S.R.'
Tass said Sergei Nikiforovich Kruglov had been appointed to
