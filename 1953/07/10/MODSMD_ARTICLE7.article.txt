# Hazard Cites Apparent Russ Social Change
## 
### 
A propertied class is appar-.
j ently being revived by the gov
: ernment of the Soviet Union, Dr.
John N. Hazard, visiting profes
: sor of political science from Co
lumbia University, told a Tues
: day Evening Series audience in
Memorial Auditorium Tuesday.
The professor said that the Rus
sian regime, interested in increas- |
ing production, has relaxed proper- |
I ty laws, allowing Russian citizens
; to own their own homes and per
! sonal effects.
He pointed out, however, that de
! spite the apparent easing of prop- j
i erty laws, the government still j
I maintains a stiff ban on speculation
(buying to sell at a profit) and on
j the hiring of workers for industrial
use.
He said that a careful study of
Soviet law indicates that the Rus
i sians are currently putting heavy
stress oil the profit incentive to
bolster lagging production.
He recited a number of cases that
have come before the Soviet Su
j preme Court in which the court act- ;
ed for the property owner. Ho said
that under court rulings and by new
legislation, the inheritance laws i
i have been considerably liberalized ,
i and that the right to protect prop- j
erty from theft or seizure has been
I carefully defined, all in favor of the
I property owner.
In all this, however, the professor 1
said, the government is maintaining
j a careful check lest the new class
grow too strong and challenge the j
! present Communist regime
He described the new class as !
i being the most favoredâ€”"pampered \
if you will" class in Russia. This is
a far cry from the strict Marxist
dictum that "Communism is the ab
sence of property," he pointed out.
Dr. Anatole Mazour, professor of
Russian history, introduced Hazard.
