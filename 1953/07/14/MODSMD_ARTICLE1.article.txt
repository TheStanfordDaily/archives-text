# Fine Weather Expected For Concert Friday Night
## 
### 
If the weatherman's prediction holds true, then Friday should
be a balmy, clear day, perfect for Stanford's first summer outdoor
concert.
To be held in the sweeping garden of the Knoll, located on Lo
mita Drive, the concert will feature Mozart selections, including

a piano concerto and two arias.
Richard Cummings will be solo
pianist and Natalie Bodanya will be
soloist soprano.
The concert, which is sponsored
by the Associated Students of Stan
ford University, will be held as a
benefit for the Summer Quarter
Scholarship Fund.
Tickets for the concert are SI and
are on sale at a booth at the Cellar,
at the ASSU office in the Nitery,
and at the Knoll.
The concert will begin at 7:30.
The huge shell from Memorial
Auditorium will be fitted between
the two wings of the Knoll to form
a music backdrop. Professor Sandor
Salgo, who will conduct the 33-
piece orchestra, feels that the Knoll,
with its spacious lawn, is a perfect
setting for an outdoor concert.
The evening program will include
the following works by Mozart:
G Minor Symphony, Number 40;
Overture to "The Marriage of Fi
garo"; Piano Concerto. Number 23
in A Major: and Iwo arias. "De
Vieni Non Tardar" from"The Mar
riage of Figaro' and "Ach. Ich
Liebe."

one of its regular practice sessions, preparing for Friday's all-Mozart concert at. the Knoll. Pro
cessor Sandor Salgo is conducting the orchestra, and the pianist is soloist Richard Cummings.
