# Academic Freedom

### 
Academic freedom appears in danger.
At least that seems to be the revealing implication of the Na
tional Education Association released last month.
The report tells how teachers in 522 representative American
school districts are reluctant to mention controversial subjects in
the classroom.
Thus, at least in these representative districts, the student is
denied a view of the full spectrum of learning and understanding.
And this, to us, seems wrong, dead wrong.
However, this sad fact obviously is not the fault of the teachers:,
ior they merely represent the communities in which they serve.
Rather, it is a bleak commentary on the communities.
Many communities . . . through school boards and such vocal
groups as the American Legion and the VFW . . . have become,
in many instances, suspicious and guarded toward education. In
some areas, even in the supposedly progressive West, a definite
feeling of anti-intellectualism has developed.
These sentiments have been nurtured, in part, by the reckless
activities of some of the congressional investigating committees,
particularly the Jenner Committee in the Senate and the Velde
Committee in the House.
To allay these fears and to make clear the rights and responsi
bilities of the academician and the student, universities and col
leges across the nation, including Stanford University, have tried
to frame cogent statements on academic freedom . . . the free
dom that supposedly protects the right to question and challenge
and seek after truth.
Yet, there is more to be done. Many of the statements issued
so far have been very high brow, incomprehensible, in fact, to
many readers.
What is needed is a down-to-earth statement that will reach and
touch everyone's understanding.
And the student's view, well expressed, is also wanted, for the
student has just as much at stake as the professor in this matter.
That is why we are encouraged that the summer Executive Com
mittee has decided to carry on the study of the problem begun last
school year.
We feel that the academic world can do much to ease current
fears. They can do so by declaring, clearly and concretely, their
responsibilities to the community, and by citing possible dangers
to academic freedom.
