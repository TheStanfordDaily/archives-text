JASPER, Alberta, Canada â€”I like bears. In zoos and in pictures. I do
not like bears any other way.
I used to like bears face to face. But a few years ago I submitted
a piece of Langendorf bread to a grizzly in Yellowstone, and he had some
trouble distinguishing between my hand and the Langendorf. He almost
had a hand sandwich.
Ever since then, I have liked bears in zoos and pictures.
Today, I rented a horse and did a solo flight through the magnifi
cently unpopulated reaches of Jasper National Park. Jasper has dozens

of little jewel-like lakes which compare favorably
with those of Switzerland, heroic mountains, abun
dant lush green forestry, and animal habitation, com
plete with massive untamed bears. Bears that are
net in zoos or in pictures.
I had been on horseback for about two hours.
The horse (Tarzan was his name) and I were on a
narrow, tree-lined trail in the middle of the Canadian
wilds. Suddenly, around a corner loped the most
enormous black bear I have ever seen.
One thing was sure. There was only room for one
on that narrow trail. Someone would have to give.

I don't know how Tarzan and the bear felt about the whole matter, but
I know how I felt. I was shaking. Because I am a coward when a bear
lopes toward me who is not in the zoo or in a picture.
The situation resolved itself. The bear, who would have been too big
to fit on the screen in Walt Disney's "Bear Country." lurched sideways
into the forest. Tarzan. not one to take the right-of-way, also lurched
linto the forest, crashing into some sapling trees in the process. Thereby
throwing me to the gVound.
I looked up and saw that not five yards away, the monstrous bear
was staring me in the face. Not waiting around to see what the bear's
intentions were, I leaped on Tarzan faster than a Chappie man can get
off a poor joke and galloped oft.
As I say. I like bears.
