Eddie Mathews, the second-year sensation of the equally surprising
Milwaukee Braves, slammed his 27th homer Sunday.
Twenty-seven at this date causes speculation as to how close he is
to the 1927 pace of Babe Ruth when the immortal poked (it).
A check of the record books shows that the Bambino had 30 at the
same date, .but the Yanks had played one more game. It all means that
Mr. Mathews is three homers behind and one game ahead of the Babe's
record. He's got a long way to go.

Have you noticed how of late the National League has surpassed the
American when it comes to slugging. If you average the top five home
run leaders of each loop you find the National is about at 23 plus while
the American is around 17. Actually it's not all slugging either, 'cause
the top National League batting averages, which indicate consistent hit
ting, also top those of the American League.

They have finally gotten around to tearing down the decayed bleach

Bob Murphy was knocked from the Oakland mound yesterday after
giving up seven runs in fewer innings. He wasn't around when the Oaks
pulled it out, 12-9, but he didn't get credit for any loss and his record
is still two wins and one defeat. He was awarded, between games, a
watch for being Stanford's most valuable player this past year.

Roger Osenbaugh, also of Stanford, won another game for Sacramento
the other evening, and got two hits which meant more to him than the
pitching win. Rog goes into the Marines this month.
