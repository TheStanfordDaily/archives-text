# Academic Freedom Session Set
## Excom Hopes Meeting Will Be First of Series 
### 
The first in a series of open discussions on academic freedora
will be held this afternoon at 4 o'clock in the lower lounge of the
Women's Clubhouse.
The meeting, to which all students and faculty members are in
vited, will be sponsored by the Executive Committee of the Asso-

ciated Students of Stanford Univer
sity and will be presided over by
President Fran Kirk.
Executive Committee members
have expressed the hope that other
meetings on the subject can be held
during the quarter and that some
manner of formal organization, with
a chairman and secretary, can be
devised.
The Executive Committee voted
to hold today's meeting at its regu
lar session last Wednesday when
several members of the committee
reported they had found consider
able interest in the subject
their constituents.
The academic freedom question
first stirred campus-wide inter
est during spring quarter when a
group of students, acting inde
pendently, framed a statement
and circulated it.
The statement roundly condemned
the Congressional investigating
committees then probing the na
tion's colleges and universities.
Last year's Executive Committee,
considering the statement, issued a
declaration saying the statement did
not represent the opinions of the
Exectuive Committee or the student
body in general, but promised that
a committee would be appointed t<>
study the problem of academic free
dom on behalf of the student body.
Such a committee was appointed
under the chairmanship of Char
lotte Trego. The committee had to
suspend work because of the end
of the quarter.
It is the hope of the summer
Executive Committee, according
to Kirk, that the discussion held
under its sponsorship will lighter
the load of Miss Trego's commit
tee when it meets again in the
fall.
Among the questions outlined fu?
study and discussion by the com
mittee last spring were;
1. Are universities carrying out
their community responsibilities?
2. Should a Communist be al-
I lowed to teach?
3. Do we favor the investigation
of the political beliefs and affilia
tions of university professors t\y
legislative investigating committees?
4. What are the rights of stu
dents? What are the rights of pro«
fessors and what are their respoosi
! biilties?
i
5. Is there a danger—an essential
j danger—to aacdemic freedom?
