# AAUP Statement On Academic Freedom
## 
### 
v (Editor's Note: In our opinion, one of the more striking state
ments on academic freedom published so far in the United
States was prepared last May by members of the Stanford Uni
versity chapter of the American Association of University Pro
fessors. The statement, to be used as a reference by the group
studying academic freedom this summer, appears below.)
"Teaching and research require an atmosphere of intellectual
freedom. Truth is not confined to popular ideas, nor can its pur
suit be circumscribed by currently fashionable methods of in
quiry. Students must not be deprived of the opportunity to
exercise their judgment on the competing views that are impor
tant in many fields.
"It follows that a university cannot fulfill its function if freedom
of inquiry and freedom of discussion are inhibited by the possi
bility that unpopular opinions and findings may be penalized.
"The necessary qualifications of a university professor are dili
gence, competence, honesty and integrity in research and teach- i
ing. His colleagues are best fitted to judge these qualifications.
This principle has long been recognized in the teaching profes-!
sion.
THE PRESENT DANGER
"The current concern over communism has become the oc
casion for numerous investigations by persons outside the uni-!
versities into the political opinions and associations of university
professors.
"Whatever the motives for such investigations, there can be no
question as to their principal effect. Awareness of the investiga '
tor, the informer, and the inquisitor is spreading on the nation's
campuses. Statements and findings are examined and re-exam
ined in the light of their possible use by outside investigators. In
such an atmosphere freedom of discussion and freedom of in
quiry are stunted, the quality of teaching degenerates, and the
pursuit of truth is inhibited.
"These effects are not conjectural or potential, but can already '
be observed on many campuses and have been reported in the
press. Nor is the evil confined to the universities. In a democ
racy, limitations on free discussion and the pursuit of truth, par
ticularly in the social sciences, must inevitably affect the health
of the body politic. The use of governmental authority for the
investigation of opinions represents a dangerous departure from
traditional American principles.
"The investigations that have these damaging effects cannot be
defended on the grounds that unfit or undesirable teachers
abound in the universities. University faculties are maintaining
the highest level of competence and integrity among their mem
bers, and their record can only be impaired by the intervention
of outside investigators.
CONCLUSION
"We strongly deplore the current investigations into the polit
ical opinions and associations of university professors, and the
use of congressional and legislative authority for such investiga
tions."
