A new camera for photographing J
microscopic particles floating iree
in the atmosphere has been an- |
nounced by Stanford Researsh In
stitute.
The current issue of the Insti- !
tute's news bulletin, "Research for |
Industry," describes the experimen
tal camera as being able to photo
graph aerosols, airborne particles as |
small as one two-thousands of an |
inch.
Paul L. Magill, technical director
of SRl's air research laboratories, j
says,"The aerosol camera will give j
air researchers an opportunity to !
study aerosols in their natural state, j
Previous microscopic techniques !
have required collection of the par- '
tides on slides.
