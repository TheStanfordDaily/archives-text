## 
### 
Members of the International
Club have a big decision to make.
Whether they'll head their boat
to Alcatraz Island or to the East
Bay on their "Day on San Francisco
Bay" Saturday.
There are two trips being offered
the"I" Club, and members have to

decide which one they'll take as a
group.
The one to Alcatraz, a one-hour
and-15-minute sea jaunt, will cost
$1.25. The East Bay trip, a two-and
a-half-hour ride, will cost $2.88.
