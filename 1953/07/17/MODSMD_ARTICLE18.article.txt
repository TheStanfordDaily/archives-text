# INSIDE RUSSIA
## Editor Reviews Struggle For Main Power Positions 
### HADLEY ROFF Editor, The Stanford Daily 
The power struggle inside Russia finally blew into the open
with the announcement last week that Lavrenty Beria, minister of
the interior and head of the dreaded secret police, was headed for
trial and most likely death.
And apparently Georgi Malenkov, the puffy-looking premier,

was winner of round one.
Whether it was a "knock-out"
round, eliminating all opposi
tion within the Soviet Union, re-

I mains to be seen.
Certainly Beria was Malenkov's
keenest rival for the power posi
tion left vacant by Josef Stalin.
Most experts on the Soviet Un
ion. judging from press associa
tion dispatches and newspaper
and magazine accounts, apparent
ly were caught oil guard by the
sudden announcement that Beria
had been ousted.
Most, so they indicate, were of the
opinion that Beria was the rising
power in Russia, the man destined
ultimately to claim Stalin's old
I mantle.
There were many indications that
| such was the case. For one thing,
I in the four months between Stalin's
I death and Beria's arrest, there was
i a remarkable relaxation in the rules
governing the minority peoples
within the USSR. Russian leaders
in three Soviet republics, Latvia,
Lithuania, and the Ukraine, were
removed from office on charges they
; pushed "Russification" too far.
Beria, himself a member of a
minority people, the Georgians,
was believed behind the move.
Experts have become even more
convinced of this within the past
week when it was revealed that
many of the officials presumably
purged by Beria have been rein
stated by Malenkov.

Another indication of Beria's ap
parent ascendancy was the fact that
several men known to favor Malen
kov were purged.
However, Beria was knocked
down deftly and quickly by Malen
kov, who personally announced the
damning charges against the power
ful policeman.
Apparently Malenkov used the
recent riots in Berlin and other lo
calities behind the "Iron Curtain"
as an excuse to nail Beria and tag
him "traitor."
Most experts are reluctant to
comment so early on the possible
significance of Beria's firing.
If editorials in Russian news
papers. as reprinted in the New
York Times, are any indication,
then Russia plans, at least for the
present, to stick lÂ»y its so-called
"peace offensive."
Inside Russia, there is little 'sign
of any popular unrest over the dis
missal. Harrison F. Salisbury, the
Times' Moscow correspondent, re
ported that the Russian people took
the news about Beria quietly and
without disorder.
