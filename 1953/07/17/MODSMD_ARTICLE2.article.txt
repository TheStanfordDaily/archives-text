A swarthy young man about 25
years of age was chased from Lagu
nita Court Wednesday night after
he had gained entry through a back
window.
He was hiding in a shower when
discovered by two coeds. When the
girls screamed he dived out a win
dow. dropping an estimated 15 feet.
Police, called to Lagunita, thought
the intruder might have injured
himself in his fall, but a search of
the lake bed and other nearby pos
sible hiding places revealed no
trace.
This was the second time within
two weeks that a prowler had
sneaked inside the girls' dormitory.
Police Chief Gordon Davis told
the Daily that the two women who
discovered the prowler were able to
give. police a detailed descrip
t' t' ..n.
