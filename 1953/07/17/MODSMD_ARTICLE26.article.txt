Blind faith in the magic words
"democracy" and "education" is
wearing out. Dr. L. D. Haskew, Dean,
of the College of Education, Univer
sity of Texas, asserted Tuesday at 3.
luncheon meeting of Phi Delta Kap
pa, men's educational fraternity, in,
Encina Commons.
The visiting educator referred
what he termed a "conservative
counter - revolution" in the social
order of the United States. He said
it began in 1944 and is marked by
two striking features: (1) a revolu
tion against income-type taxes, anc
(2) a spasmodic revolution against
the democratic ideal of equalitarian
ism. The revolution against equal
ity thrives on the indirect approach
and under many guises. Dean Has
kew said.
"Our schools have an offensive
as well as a defensive role," he
declared, and stressed that school
public relations functions must n<>
longer lie "commercial advertis
ing" for a blind faith in education
The new phase in school public
relations must build an intelligent
faith in education, he said.
Next Tuesday Dr. G. E. Dotson,
of the summer School of Educatic"
faculty, will speak to the group on
"What Is a Community College?"
Luncheon tickets can be obtainai
in advance at the Phi Delta Kappi
cubicle on the third floor of the
School of Education building for
51.
