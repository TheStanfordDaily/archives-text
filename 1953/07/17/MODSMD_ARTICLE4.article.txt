# '2nd Threshold' Is Pleasant Surprise to First Nighter
## 
### FIRST NIGHTER 
I was surprised, totally and pleasantly.
For some reason I had prematurely underestimated the talents
of the Stanford Players . . . talents which proved themselves
bountiful and exciting at the opening performance Wednesday
night of "Second Threshhold," a sobering, penetrating play on

modern life by Philip Barry and<
Robert E. Sherwood.
For some reason I had ex
pected something amateurish when
I took my seat in the Little Thea
ter and awaited the curtain.
Maybe it was because of the j
smallness of the theater. Maybe!

it was because of a nagging, but
erroneous, impression that during
summer quarter activities only half
function.
But whatever hesitancy or doubt
I felt before the play is now washed
away, and there remain only the
pleasurable memory of having at
tended a very mature play, very
maturely acted.
There were a few flaws, to be
sure. But most of them can be
chalked gff, I feel sure, to opening
night jitters. For one thing, the
lead, Webster Smalley, seemed too
abrupt, too hasty at times, both in
action and in words. Sometimes, in
fact, his words seemed to run to
gether. making listening difficult.
But these were minor, almost mi
croscopic faults, detracting only
slightly from the gripping drama.
The pla\ dealt with a successful,
perhaps too successful, government
official who had, in his climb to 1
power and prestige, severed himself
emotionally from his family, his
friends, from what Barry consid
ered the enjoyable basis of life it
self.
He had placed himself on a lofty,
detached, intellectual pinnacle, and!
there, alone and in growing misery, j
he began to evaluate his life, and he j
found it contemptible.
It was in such a state, totally dis- '
illusioned, convinced that suicide
would provide the only escape, that
he was re-discovered by his daugh
ter.
It is this re-discovery, this re
kindling of neglected love, that pro
vider the essential drama of the
play.
Smalley, except for the several
Haws already noted, as the former
government official, on the sur- !
face very urbane and very cyini- j
cal, turns in a first-rate perform
ance.
But the star performance of the
evening, in my mind, was provided
by Joan Humphreys, who plays the ;
daughter. Hers was an extremely j
competent and convincing perform- '
ance.
No less entertaining was Suzanne
Marion as a 'teen-ager. Pert and ■
spry, she added a note of well-re- I
ceived humor in an otherwise som- i
ber plot.
Frank Kinsolla, as a young doc
tor. also did quite well.
Fred Bernstein and Dick Yeo
rounded out the cast. Both had but
minor roles.
A. Nicholas Vardac directed the
production.
As I said earlier. I hadn't expected
much when I first entered the Lit
tle Theater Wednesday night. But
now I am looking forward expec
tantly to the next Players' produc
tion. "Henry IV." which will open
in the Little Theater Aug. 6.

it was because of a nagging, but
erroneous, impression that during
summer quarter activities only half
function.
But whatever hesitancy or doubt
I felt before the play is now washed
away, and there remain only the
pleasurable memory of having at
tended a very mature play, very
maturely acted.
There were a few flaws, to be
sure. But most of them can be
chalked gff, I feel sure, to opening
night jitters. For one thing, the
lead, Webster Smalley, seemed too
abrupt, too hasty at times, both in
action and in words. Sometimes, in
fact, his words seemed to run to
gether. making listening difficult.
But these were minor, almost mi
croscopic faults, detracting only
slightly from the gripping drama.
The pla\ dealt with a successful,
perhaps too successful, government
official who had, in his climb to 1
power and prestige, severed himself
emotionally from his family, his
friends, from what Barry consid
ered the enjoyable basis of life it
self.
He had placed himself on a lofty,
detached, intellectual pinnacle, and!
there, alone and in growing misery, j
he began to evaluate his life, and he j
found it contemptible.
It was in such a state, totally dis- '
illusioned, convinced that suicide
would provide the only escape, that
he was re-discovered by his daugh
ter.
It is this re-discovery, this re
kindling of neglected love, that pro
vider the essential drama of the
play.
Smalley, except for the several
Haws already noted, as the former
government official, on the sur- !
face very urbane and very cyini- j
cal, turns in a first-rate perform
ance.
But the star performance of the
evening, in my mind, was provided
by Joan Humphreys, who plays the ;
daughter. Hers was an extremely j
competent and convincing perform- '
ance.
No less entertaining was Suzanne
Marion as a 'teen-ager. Pert and ■
spry, she added a note of well-re- I
ceived humor in an otherwise som- i
ber plot.
Frank Kinsolla, as a young doc
tor. also did quite well.
Fred Bernstein and Dick Yeo
rounded out the cast. Both had but
minor roles.
A. Nicholas Vardac directed the
production.
As I said earlier. I hadn't expected
much when I first entered the Lit
tle Theater Wednesday night. But
now I am looking forward expec
tantly to the next Players' produc
tion. "Henry IV." which will open
in the Little Theater Aug. 6.
I was surprised, totally and pleasantly.
For some reason I had prematurely underestimated the talents
of the Stanford Players . . . talents which proved themselves
bountiful and exciting at the opening performance Wednesday
night of "Second Threshhold," a sobering, penetrating play on

modern life by Philip Barry and<
Robert E. Sherwood.
For some reason I had ex
pected something amateurish when
I took my seat in the Little Thea
ter and awaited the curtain.
Maybe it was because of the j
smallness of the theater. Maybe!
