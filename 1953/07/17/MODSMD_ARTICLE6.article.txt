# More Freedom Talks Planned
## 
### 
More than 40 students, represent
ing almost every department, both
graduate and undergraduate, at
tended Tuesday the first open dis
cussion held this quarter on aca
demic freedom and decided unani
mously to continue holding sessions
throughout the quarter.
A second meeting is planned for
next Tuesday to be held in the
j lower lounge of the Women's
J Clubhouse at 4 p.m.
The meetings will be sponsored
j by the Executive Committee of
the Associated Students of Stan
| ford University.
Student Body President Fran
Kirk and others who attended the
meeting expressed surprise at the
large and enthusiastic turnout.
Most students attending said they
came because they sensed a grow
ing threat against academic free
dom, particularly arising from what
some termed the reckless activities
of the Congressional investigating
committees.
Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy (R..
Wis.), chairman of the Senate's
Permanent Subcommittee on In
vestigations was cited in this
connection by many in attend
ance.
Most of the meeting, however,
was devoted to a discussion on pos
sible definitions for academic free
dom.
Some held that academic freedom
! is without any limit and that the
only criterion for judging the wor
thiness of a teacher is his compe
tence in his field.
But others insisted that there
were legal and as they said ethical
limitations that would limit some
what the full exercise of academic
freedom.
At the end of the quarter the
group hopes to be able to compile
a report that can be submitted to
next school year's Executive Com
mittee for study and action.
