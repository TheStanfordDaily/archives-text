# MED SCHOOL TO CAMPUS
## Move From SF Ordered By Trustees 
### 
Stanford's Board of Trustees
yesterday announced plans to
consolidate the University's
Medical School activities on tha
main University campus.
The move is to be made in
an estimated three to five years
at a cost as yet to be deter
mined.
New buildings are to be con
structed on campus, where the first
year of the medical course has bee:t
conducted since Stanford acquired
the School in 1908 and where four
of the Medical School's laboratories
are located.
Endowment for operating ex
penses will be sought in addition to
an amount for buildings.
Provost Douglas M. Whitaker,
acting for President Sterling, who
is in England as a representative of
the American Association of Uni
versities, reported the Trustees' de
cision followed a year-long study of
the Stanford Medical School and of
medical education nationally.
President Sterling, in a written
report to the Trustees, declared
the decision was based on the
conviction that the future of med
ical education is dependent 011 the
course of medical science, which
has become increasingly depend
ent on the basic physical sciences
and the social sciences.
"This key relationship of medical
education and science to other sci
entific fields can best be strength
ened and advanced by bringing the
Medical School into the closest pos
sible physical and intellectual rela
tionship to the whole University,"
the president stated.
The new Medical School build
ings will probably be located some
where in the general area between
the Palo Alto Hospital and the pres
ent anatomy and bacteriology labo
ratories, which are directly behind
the Stanford Museum.
