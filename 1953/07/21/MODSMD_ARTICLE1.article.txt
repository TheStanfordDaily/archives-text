# AT THE STANFORD BUSINESS CONFERENCE
## Posin Cites Weakness in USSR 
### 
There are definite signs of
growing weakness and unrest
within the Soviet Union and her
satellites, Professor Jack A. Po
sin of the Department of Asiatic
and Slavic Studies told delegates
to the 12th Annual Stanford Bus
iness Conference Tuesday eve
ning in Cubberley Auditorium.
The well-known Russian ex
pert said, "Regardless of the ap
parent strength of the Russian
regime today, there are signs of
weak spots in the Iron Curtain
and in the satellite countries."
He said he felt sure that a
break-up of the sweeping Com

munist empire is bound to occur.
When, he didn't know.
The recent riots in East Berlin
and other behind-the-Iron-Cur
tain locales might not indicate an
immediate break-up, Posin as
serted, "but they do show what
can be done."
He said that Americans can do
two things "to speed this histori
cal abnormality which we call
the Soviet dictatorship on its
way into long-overdue oblivion."
First, he said, the nation must
make itself physically and mili
tarily strong.
Second, he continued, "we

must preserve and strengthen
our own democracy."
In detailing the reasons why he
considers the Iron Curtain to be
threatening to crumble, the pro
fessor said, "There are strong in
dications that there is something
definitely rotten in the Commu
nist hierarchy itself."
"There is no unity among the
Bolsheviks," he declared.
Another factor, he said, "is
that the people are not cowed,
they are utterly confused."
He said that Russian and sat
ellite leaders have no standards
to judge their activities.

He pointed out that what
might be favored one day by the
Kremlin might be condemned
without warning the next.
"I cannot believe that the Rus
sian people are going to stand
this type of intellectual rape for
ever," he declared.
Weaknesses are also showing
up within the satellites, the au
thority on Soviet affairs claimed.
Taking the satellite nations one
by one, Posin pointed out what
he considers to be the main ele
ments of weakness.
In Poland, it is a history filled
with bloody antagonism for Rus

sia.
In East Germany, it is the
feeling among Germans that they
are culturally superior to their
Eastern rulers.
In Czechoslovakia, it is a his
tory of democratic advance.
In Hungary, it is religion.
In China, it is traditional na
tionalism, the desire of Chinese
to run their own country.
Other reasons were cited by
the Russian-born professor, all
pointing, in his mind, to the
eventual disintegration of the
Iron Curtain . . . and "its odious
dictatorship," to use his term.
