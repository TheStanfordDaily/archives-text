# CAMPUS OPINION
## In Praise of McCarthy 
### 
To the Editor:
The United States faces a deadly enemy—the influence of Communism
on today's generation. Certain men have taken it upon themselves to rid
our nation of this dangerous parasite. I have long been an admirer of
Senator Joseph McCarthy and his action against the subversive elements
in the United States. Everyone is entitled to his or her opinions and ideals
(this freedom is guaranteed in the Constitution, you will remember), but
a person who holds Communistic ideals above American ideals is a threat
to our nation.
Whether this is generally known or not, the majority of Communists
in the United States are professors and, though I am ashamed to admit it,
clergymen. It is just as easy to have a Communistic-minded professor
here at Stanford as it is at any other university or college in the United
States.
You stated in your editorial Tuesday that many professors left investi
gations with ruined reputations. Out of curiosity I looked through a few
Un-American reports and found, not to my amazement, that these very
SJ ine professors had stood on the Fifth Amendment when asked if they
•were or had been Communists. Any person may stand on this amendment
[for this is one of our American freedoms however, it seems strange to me,
a to the majority of Americans, that a man, when asked this now famous
question, would not answer with a simple yes or no. If a man is not a
Communist, he should not be afraid to say no: however, if a man is a
Communist and believes in its ideals, he should be proud to say yes.
An I if I still have not convinced you, Mr. Editor, that Senator McCar
thy is doing what is best, I suggest that you look into every man that the
S nator has ever accused or questioned. You will find that the Honorable
Si-nator from Wisconsin has always been right.
It is up to Stanford to make sure that our slate is clean. If we do
have a clean slate, we will not have to be bothered by an Un-American
Committee investigation. It is up to the students and the faculty to keep
o irselves and our campus above reproach. We can do this when people
stop all of their complaining and sob acts and start working against the
growing menace of Communism.

(Editor's note: I'm as anxious as anyone to wipe out the threat of
Communism, but 1 seriously doubt whether McCarthy lias found the
proper weapon. I agree heartily with Dr. Posin's statement, quoted
elsewhere in this paper, that "Our democratic way of life is our strong
e t weapon."
