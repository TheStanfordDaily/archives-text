BANFF. Alberta, Canada—The heroic landscape of this Jasper-Lake
Louise-Banff territory is the closest thing North America has to Switzer
land. And yet I can't help feeling that the enjoyment of the brilliance
of this territory is somewhat dimmed (as, indeed, it is in Switzerland,
Paris, and every worth-while spot this side of the Iron Curtain) by that
most horrible of all species . . . the typical American tourist. That omni
present person who believes in going to only those places at which other

tourists are so thick that they keep getting into each
other's snapshots. 112
The girls at the information desks at Lake Louise r
and Banff have more contact with the American tour- j
ists than anyone else in this region, and they conclude
that answering questions for the tourists compares
favorably to running to the top of Mount Everest •<
barefoot on a trail of broken beer bottles.
One of the information girls at Lake Louise, an
a ttractive Scotch girl, was asked by a Hollywooder.
"Say, you know that lovely glacier in the mountains
behind Lake Louise? What time at night do they "

floodlight it?"
The girl, horrified that anyone would want to encroach on the already
perfect job that nature had done, fought off nausea as she politely lied,
' They haven't been able to get electricity up there yet."'
The same girl was seriously asked by another American who was
Max Factor-conscious, "'Just what do you put in the lake to give it that
jnice color?"
Another Lake Louise information girl, a blonde Canadian, describes
the typical American lady as "a woman who wears plaid, stripes, and
polkadots, all at once; who wears a straw hat with a veil: who inquires
about all the sport activities "available and who ends up spending her live
diys sitting inside looking out at the scenery."
The comely, dark-haired information girl at the plush Banff Hotel
lists the most frequent questions she receives:
1. "Ahem, where is the womens' room?"
2. "Where is the elevator?" (The elevator is only a few yards away
from the information desk and very visible.)
Standing near the breath-taking Banff Falls. I overheard a well-up
holstered lady in a wild print dress remark in a Mid-Western accent. "My,
my, Henry, doesn't that waterfall there look just like a backdrop in a
movie?"
And somehow or other I wished at that moment that Henry and his
wife with the wild print dress and the Mid-Western accent would go
away .so that I could enjoy the falls. And that someday Einstein or some
one would invent a scientific formula that would do away with American
tot ists who ask stupid questions.
