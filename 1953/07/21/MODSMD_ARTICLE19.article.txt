## Ehrmann Eyes Importance Of U.S. in World Affairs 
### HARRY MARTIN 
In defining the United States foreign policy position in 1939
and 1953, Howard M. Ehrmann, visiting professor of history from
the University of Michigan, recalled, in his Tuesday Evening
Series speech, the remaik made by Winston Churchill that "the
price of greatness is responsibility."

Ehrmann contrasted present
day foreign policy with the pol
icy pursued between 1919 and
1939.
During the 20-year inter-war pe
riod. he pointed out, the U.S. was
unwilling to enter into entangling
alliances; unwilling to accept col
lective security; unwilling to com
pel states to mediation and judg
ment before the World Court; and
unwilling to choose between states
when a dispute arose that ques
tioned the status quo.
"Today, no combination in Europe
is strong enough to stop Russia,"
.surmised Ehrmann. "Help must
come from the outside and we
realize that. United States inter
vention in European affairs is the
only answer that will maintain
peace."
America learned its lesson from
the iuter-war years, lie continued,
and now has built up a network
of mutual security treaties with
Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
Besides these treaties the United
States is promoting the European

Defense Community as an answer
to Russian advances in Europe.
This Defense Community needs
only ratification by France to j;o
into effect. But in France, the coun
try is plagued with the old Franco-
German antagonisms and still fears
a strong Germany, the visiting pro
fessor advised. The EDC is strongly
supported by both the English and
American governments.
In the NATO we have strength
ened the peace of Western Europe
and have given security to the 14
signers ol that pact, Ehrmann said.
This organization will balk any in
tentions the Russians have in the
Western world, he asserted.
Ehrmann pointed out one of the
major problems that the Western
world faces today is in Austria,
where the Soviet Union refuses to
consider a peace treaty.
