# Fisher Says Political Power, Not Military, Best Weapon
## 
### 
The United States and its allies must find new political means
for bridging the gap between West and East if the cold war is to
be ended peacefully, Dr. Harold H. Fisher, chairman of the Hoover
Institute and Library, stressed last night in a speech before the
12th Annual Business Conference in Cubberley Auditorium.

♦ Political power, not military pow
| er, is the ultimate weapon in inter
i national affairs, he declared.
Though military preparedness is
I important, he said, it is not enough
j to secure peace.
"We must go farther than pre
j paredness," the professor said, "and
i perfect the other means of inter
! course between peoples that bear
upon the hopes and fears and the
: well-being of men everywhere."
These means, he said, "must reach
j the minds and hearts not only of
our own citizens and the citizens of
i friendly countries but also of the
subjects of hostile regimes."
In his view, peace can be secure
only when "peoples of other coun
tries. friendly or neutral, free or
| enslaved," join us "in the high
purpose of making the world a
better place to live for every
j body."
This can be accomplished, he said,
| through the development of politi
j eal warfare, with its stress on "the
; progressive elimination of national
1 discrepancies through the free asso
ciation of free minds in free enter-
I prise to promote the general wel
fare and secure the blessings of lib
erty for all men."
Yesterday morning Erwin D.
Canham, editor of the Christian
Science Monitor, delivering the
fourth in a series of five lectures
entitled "New Dimensions of Bus
iness Leadership," called upon
business men to enter into poli
tics.
"Business needs government and
government needs business," he
said.
He urged the business executives
attending the conference to partici
pate or allow employees to partici
pate in government, "even on the
ward level."
He claimed that such participa
tion would be one way "to avoid the
evils of big government ... or so
cialism."
He cited four other steps business
might take to stop the "spread of
government."
3. '"It can contyiue to do its own
job better in productivity, and
progress in development and
service."
2. "It can continue the great
revolutionary progress of the past
decade."
3. "Business can do a better job
for the community in recognition
and fulfilment of its social obliga
tions."
4. ' Business can be sure that ev
ery possible task is performed by
voluntary private organization
which otherwise government might
do."
"I? we don't accept these respon
sibilities," he warned, "government
will move in."
The conference, said to be the
largest ever hosted by the Stanford
Graduate School of Business, will
adjourn at noon tod»7.
