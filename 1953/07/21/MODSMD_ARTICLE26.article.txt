If you want good laughs come oh over to the Women's Athletic Field
tomorrow afternoon at 1 when the students meet the faculty in a baseball '
titanic. If you want good baseball stay home and watch the majors go 1
at it on TV.

Some of (lie top divers in the nation work out each Sunday afternoon
in the men's pool in preparation for national competition which gets
going in August.
It's quite something to watch one after another soar from great
heights, each doinyg his assortment of point-winning maneuvers, and
then cutting the water cleanly only to he followed by a seemingly more
artistic performer.
Don Harper and Johnny Murphy, both from Seqouia, are working out.
Morley Shapiro and Jerry Harrison, from Ohio State, are practicing their j
stuff. And two of the best in the business, Dr. Sammy Lee and Bruce
Harlan, are giving tips where needed.

Things are looking up for the Stanford soccer team. Charles Ander- i
son. an All-American player from San Francisco State, has been accepted !
fall quarter.
The business of All-American selection of soccer players is unique, j
Following each game, the coaches and referee each turn in a card with j
the name of the player they thought most outstanding, regardless of what!
team he played for. These are submitted to a national committee and i
the men with the most mentions at the Ylose of a season are named to
an All-America.

As for the rest of the Stanford
team there's no telling, as so many
of its members are foreign students.
« * *
Athletic action on the campus is
non - existent' this quarter. Only
sun - bathers and an occasional
couple or, even more seldom, a
book - burdened student, dot- the
fields which three quarters of the
year are overrun with athletes.
There isn't even a hamburger
decathlon on tap this summer.
Last year, Don Sanders, a foot
baller now in the service, won
this student edition of the real
thing, amassing 5,59!) points. Hob
Mathias on the same point sys
tem would have totaled S.:»SS. But
the difference was not considered
severe, especially when Sanders
did no training and several of the
ten events were completely new
to him.
