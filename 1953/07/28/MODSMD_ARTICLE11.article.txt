Freedom and Senator MeCarthy

n\. the Editor:
Maureen Jameson (whose letter appeared in the Stanford Daily July
24) owes it to herself to analyze her own words. Communism doesn't
deserve her kindness, She has granted the party a majority membership
jo! our country's most learned men, inside and outside theology. Her rea
.sonirig indicates that either (1) the party has a very small following, or
(2) the party has a wealth of greater minds than hers.
Miss Jameson is confused about American freedom of opinion. Cer
tainly she realizes a freedom doesn't exist where the exercise of that
lltvedom is fraught with personal danger. It was not meant to be that our
01 ly ale freedom should be agreement with McCarthy.
Miss Jameson's curiosity led her to examine "a few Un-American
{reports," and on that basis she urges tlie editor to look into "every man
tthat thf Senator has ever accused or questioned," and the editor will find
(McCarthy has always been right. Now I can't say how often McCarthy
has been wrong, but 1 recall no case where he has proven himself right.
His victims have suffered though, just as if he were proven right, and
there lies the tragedy.
Wake up, Miss Jameson! Your churches are under attack; your schools
are being bombarded; your books are being burned; your mind is being
destroyed. You have embraced the arch-subvert in America, the man
Kvho has infested our society with fear and suspicion, the demon from
Wisconsin.

To the Editor:
This is another of the many letters which you have undoubtedly re
jtM.-ived protesting Miss Jameson's rather naive letter printed in the July 24
c. ition of the Stanford Daily. I have written to challenge some of her
M tements and to clarify some of the issues which her letter raised.
In her letter she states, "Certain men have taken it upon themselves
<t<> rid our nation of this dangerous parasite (Communism)." No one denies
Ili.il Communism is dangerous. What thinking Americans deplore, how
ever, is the tendency to combat Communism with totalitarian tactics. We
have in (ho United States excellent weapons of defense against Commu
nism, and they have been successfully used. We need not resort to Senator
'iM Carthy's techniques of equating accusations with facts, and charges
SA/ith proof.
"You will find that the honorable Senator from Wisconsin has always
(been right," says Miss Jameson. This indeed would be a triumph for
McCarthy's methods were it true. But I challenge Miss Jameson to name
one man whom McCarthy has had before his committee who has proved
to be a Communist. McCarthy refuses to account for his actions; let his
accomplishments, then, speak for him.
Miss Jameson is "amazed" to find that some professors whom McCar
thy had before his inquisitional board "stood on the Fifth Amendment."
"If a man is not a Communist," she says,"he would not be afraid to say
110; however, if a man is a Communist and believes in its ideals, he
should be proud to say yes." Ah! Were it as simple as all that. Miss
Jameson, I take it, has never heard of the "waiver clause." The "waiver
clause" in essence states that by voluntarily disclosing an incriminating
fact —that is, a fact which could lawfully have been withheld—the wit
ness is deemed to have waived his privilege with respect to any fact
related to the one disclosed. (He has, in effect, rejected the protection
•which his Constitution affords him.) If a witness elects to talk freely
about himself and then refuses to name others, he can be sent to jail for
ccntempt.
What right, morally speaking, has one witness to disclose information
about another person, when, for the most part, the information requested
by the committee deals with happenings of many years ago, and when
the witness was just barely acquainted with the accused? How can this
witness be morally sure of his fellow's thoughts and tendencies then or
fifteen 01 twenty years ago? Furthermore, if one considers McCarthy's
committee as an assault on the freedom of thought, how can he justify
lus supplying that committee with more ammunition with which to con
tinue its attacks on this precious freedom?
To identify McCarthyism with patriotism Ls to equate self-contradic
tory terms, for freedom of thought and inquiry are the cornerstone of
America. When sterile conformity is the measure of patriotism, when
democracy is betrayed by self-anointed demagogues who claim to defend
it, when all opposition is crushed ouf by charges of racial and religious
bias, then McCarthybsm will have triumphed and the freedoms of Amer
ica shall have been.

"Palm Drive, A Deadly Menace*

fTo the Editor:
A bumpy ride down Palm Drive is an exciting experience to the new
comer who, for the first time, admires the Stanford hills through the long
lows of palms and eucalypti. To the commuting student, bouncing daily
along to make a nine o'clock, its washboard surface presents perhaps
bnly a tolerable annoyance. But to the night rider—as car after car conies
charging at him at incredible speed, too often manned by sleepy, date
happy students—the charming thoroughfare becomes a deadly menace.
Its badly sloping sides invite care to the center of the dimly lit roadway,
Regardless of the direct cause of the fatal accident of a week a«o Satur
day, one may speculate as to the part played by this archaic road.

Deplores McCarthy's Tactics

To the Editor:
This is another of the many letters which you have undoubtedly re
jtM.-ived protesting Miss Jameson's rather naive letter printed in the July 24
c. ition of the Stanford Daily. I have written to challenge some of her
M tements and to clarify some of the issues which her letter raised.
In her letter she states, "Certain men have taken it upon themselves
<t<> rid our nation of this dangerous parasite (Communism)." No one denies
Ili.il Communism is dangerous. What thinking Americans deplore, how
ever, is the tendency to combat Communism with totalitarian tactics. We
have in (ho United States excellent weapons of defense against Commu
nism, and they have been successfully used. We need not resort to Senator
'iM Carthy's techniques of equating accusations with facts, and charges
SA/ith proof.
"You will find that the honorable Senator from Wisconsin has always
(been right," says Miss Jameson. This indeed would be a triumph for
McCarthy's methods were it true. But I challenge Miss Jameson to name
one man whom McCarthy has had before his committee who has proved
to be a Communist. McCarthy refuses to account for his actions; let his
accomplishments, then, speak for him.
Miss Jameson is "amazed" to find that some professors whom McCar
thy had before his inquisitional board "stood on the Fifth Amendment."
"If a man is not a Communist," she says,"he would not be afraid to say
110; however, if a man is a Communist and believes in its ideals, he
should be proud to say yes." Ah! Were it as simple as all that. Miss
Jameson, I take it, has never heard of the "waiver clause." The "waiver
clause" in essence states that by voluntarily disclosing an incriminating
fact —that is, a fact which could lawfully have been withheld—the wit
ness is deemed to have waived his privilege with respect to any fact
related to the one disclosed. (He has, in effect, rejected the protection
•which his Constitution affords him.) If a witness elects to talk freely
about himself and then refuses to name others, he can be sent to jail for
ccntempt.
What right, morally speaking, has one witness to disclose information
about another person, when, for the most part, the information requested
by the committee deals with happenings of many years ago, and when
the witness was just barely acquainted with the accused? How can this
witness be morally sure of his fellow's thoughts and tendencies then or
fifteen 01 twenty years ago? Furthermore, if one considers McCarthy's
committee as an assault on the freedom of thought, how can he justify
lus supplying that committee with more ammunition with which to con
tinue its attacks on this precious freedom?
To identify McCarthyism with patriotism Ls to equate self-contradic
tory terms, for freedom of thought and inquiry are the cornerstone of
America. When sterile conformity is the measure of patriotism, when
democracy is betrayed by self-anointed demagogues who claim to defend
it, when all opposition is crushed ouf by charges of racial and religious
bias, then McCarthybsm will have triumphed and the freedoms of Amer
ica shall have been.

"Palm Drive, A Deadly Menace*

fTo the Editor:
A bumpy ride down Palm Drive is an exciting experience to the new
comer who, for the first time, admires the Stanford hills through the long
lows of palms and eucalypti. To the commuting student, bouncing daily
along to make a nine o'clock, its washboard surface presents perhaps
bnly a tolerable annoyance. But to the night rider—as car after car conies
charging at him at incredible speed, too often manned by sleepy, date
happy students—the charming thoroughfare becomes a deadly menace.
Its badly sloping sides invite care to the center of the dimly lit roadway,
Regardless of the direct cause of the fatal accident of a week a«o Satur
day, one may speculate as to the part played by this archaic road.

destroyed. You have embraced the arch-subvert in America, the man
Kvho has infested our society with fear and suspicion, the demon from
Wisconsin.

Deplores McCarthy's Tactics

1 J
To the Editor:
This is another of the many letters which you have undoubtedly re
jtM.-ived protesting Miss Jameson's rather naive letter printed in the July 24
c. ition of the Stanford Daily. I have written to challenge some of her
M tements and to clarify some of the issues which her letter raised.
In her letter she states, "Certain men have taken it upon themselves
<t<> rid our nation of this dangerous parasite (Communism)." No one denies
Ili.il Communism is dangerous. What thinking Americans deplore, how
ever, is the tendency to combat Communism with totalitarian tactics. We
have in (ho United States excellent weapons of defense against Commu
nism, and they have been successfully used. We need not resort to Senator
'iM Carthy's techniques of equating accusations with facts, and charges
SA/ith proof.
"You will find that the honorable Senator from Wisconsin has always
(been right," says Miss Jameson. This indeed would be a triumph for
McCarthy's methods were it true. But I challenge Miss Jameson to name
one man whom McCarthy has had before his committee who has proved
to be a Communist. McCarthy refuses to account for his actions; let his
accomplishments, then, speak for him.
Miss Jameson is "amazed" to find that some professors whom McCar
thy had before his inquisitional board "stood on the Fifth Amendment."
"If a man is not a Communist," she says,"he would not be afraid to say
110; however, if a man is a Communist and believes in its ideals, he
should be proud to say yes." Ah! Were it as simple as all that. Miss
Jameson, I take it, has never heard of the "waiver clause." The "waiver
clause" in essence states that by voluntarily disclosing an incriminating
fact —that is, a fact which could lawfully have been withheld—the wit
ness is deemed to have waived his privilege with respect to any fact
related to the one disclosed. (He has, in effect, rejected the protection
•which his Constitution affords him.) If a witness elects to talk freely
about himself and then refuses to name others, he can be sent to jail for
ccntempt.
What right, morally speaking, has one witness to disclose information
about another person, when, for the most part, the information requested
by the committee deals with happenings of many years ago, and when
the witness was just barely acquainted with the accused? How can this
witness be morally sure of his fellow's thoughts and tendencies then or
fifteen 01 twenty years ago? Furthermore, if one considers McCarthy's
committee as an assault on the freedom of thought, how can he justify
lus supplying that committee with more ammunition with which to con
tinue its attacks on this precious freedom?
To identify McCarthyism with patriotism Ls to equate self-contradic
tory terms, for freedom of thought and inquiry are the cornerstone of
America. When sterile conformity is the measure of patriotism, when
democracy is betrayed by self-anointed demagogues who claim to defend
it, when all opposition is crushed ouf by charges of racial and religious
bias, then McCarthybsm will have triumphed and the freedoms of Amer
ica shall have been.

"Palm Drive, A Deadly Menace*

fTo the Editor:
A bumpy ride down Palm Drive is an exciting experience to the new
comer who, for the first time, admires the Stanford hills through the long
lows of palms and eucalypti. To the commuting student, bouncing daily
along to make a nine o'clock, its washboard surface presents perhaps
bnly a tolerable annoyance. But to the night rider—as car after car conies
charging at him at incredible speed, too often manned by sleepy, date
happy students—the charming thoroughfare becomes a deadly menace.
Its badly sloping sides invite care to the center of the dimly lit roadway,
Regardless of the direct cause of the fatal accident of a week a«o Satur
day, one may speculate as to the part played by this archaic road.
