# Summer Sports Chatter

### DICK KKOENIGSBERGER 
The other day, we went down Middlefield Road to the ball-park. No
ordinary ball-park was this, however. Yes, there was a grandstand, and
a diamond, and a left field fence, and there were two dugouts. But every
thing was on a diminutive scale. The bases were some GO feet apart, the
fences some 180 feet from home plate, and the backstop some 15 feet high.
Except for the apparent shrinkage, the place resembled a major league
ball-park. And the players, in full uniform, resembled major leaguers.
Only difference was that these players were only 7 to .12. This was Little
League Stadium, home of the Palo Alto Little League.
On the mound, a 12-year-old was making ready to come down with
the first pitch. At the plate, two smaller lads, ages 8 and 9, one with
complete small-scale catching paraphernalia and the other with a slightly
oversized bat, were also preparing for action. Behind the pair, on his
knees, was a full-grown umpire, who growled, "Play ball!"
Down came the first pitch, a sizzling fastball. "Strike one!" rumbled
the uinp. "Boo!*' cried the spectators, who were, for the most part,
parents of the contestants. In came the next pitch, a sharp breaking
curve. The batter swung and drilled the ball on the ground. Far to his
right went the shortstop, backhanded the pellet like a professional, and
burled the ball some 50 feet to first base. "You're out." bellowed umpire
Dick Clcgg. of Stanford.
Alter the game, in which the Am-Vets took a 3-0 decision from the
20-30 Club, we went down to the field to chat with umpire Clegg, who
during the school year coaches both the Stanford freshman baseball and
basketball teams. We asked Dick how he liked his summer work.
"I like it very much," he answered. "It's a great experience working
with and helping these kids. And it's a lot harder work than it would
seein on first sight. Much tougher on the ump than a regular ball game.
"You see, an umpire carries a lot more responsibility in this type of
ball game than in one in which older people participate. The ump not
only has to call the plays, but he must try to take care of the kids both
physically and mentally.
"In this last respect, the umping can get rough, for the ump must tune
his ear on the comments of the spectators. At their age, the kids are very
sensitive, and a careless comment on the part of an over-zealous parent
can be very injurious to a boy."
The Palo Alto Little League, like the thousand other leagues of its
kind, is a great thing. It provides thousands of kids with the cleanest and
best of entertainment. Parents are solidly behind the organization, and
they all go to the ball park to watch the young, and with but a few ex
ceptions, few get carried away.
If you have nothing to do between 4 aqd 7:30 some afternoon, why
don't you go out to the Little League Stadium and watch our future
major leaguers?
