# Taylor Paces Fatuity Win
## 
### 
A faculty team paced by the fine
pitching and hitting of Professor
Donald Taylor of the Psychology
Department outlasted a student
nine, 8-7, in the athletic highlight of
Sports Day last Saturday on the
women's athletic field.
Contributing to the faculty cause
was the hitting of Education Pro
fessors John Nixon and Arthur Co
ladarci. Nate Allen of the admis
sions office added his bit.
Starting student hurler Lyle Peck
was hard hit through the entire
nine innings and it was only good
defensive play by infielders Dick
Koenigsberger at second, Larry
j Cahn at short, and Dick Monteith at
i third, coupled with the outfield play
of Blair Pascoe, which kept the fac
| ulty in check until they came from
j behind to score two runs in the
ninth to win.
Pascoe, Koenigsberger, Phil Hicks,
i and Walt Wonderlick led the stu
dents at bat.
Following the classic, which was
well handled on the public address
system by Jim Banks, the players
and close to a hundred spectators
were refreshed by watermelon and
a swim in the women's pool.
Through the course of the after
! noon volleyball games, swimming
and more watermelon occupied the
several hundred students, faculty,
I and guests at the annual ASSU
j sponsored Sports Day.
