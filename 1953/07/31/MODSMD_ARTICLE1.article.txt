stage of Memorial Auditorium signals the last stage of rehearsals
for Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part I. The play, the second produc
tion of the Stanford Players' summer season, will be presented on
August 6, 7, and 8.
Sword fighting is only one of the special g 1 :,,c - in

most popular his
torical play. An expert in Welsh
language and music has been
called in to drill one of the players
in a rapid-fire Welsh conversation
and a Celtic love song required in
a major scene.
Processional music for the court
scenes has been selected to give
an authentic background to the re
creation of the medieval times of
King Henry IV, The splendor of
the period will be further reflected
in the rich and colorful costumes
designed by Hugo Melchione, and
in the lighting by Delford Brum
mer,
The netting, by Wendell Cole, is
a permanent unit modeled on the
Elizabethan public playhouse, de
signed to briivj the audience into

lower playing levels of the setting
allow for maximum variety and
flexibility in Ihe lightning shifts of
scene demanded by Shakespeare.
