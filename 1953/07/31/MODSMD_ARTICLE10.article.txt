# More Letters on the McCarthy Issue
## 'Face Facts' 
### 
To (he Editor:
I have followed with great inter
est your editorial policy of con
demning Senator Joseph McCar
thy. I was on the point of writing
•when Miss Jameson caused the re
cent debate in the Daily to break
forth . I cannot say that I agree with
everything Miss Jameson says, but
I think she has hit on something of
value. In Her last paragraph she
says:
"It is up to Stanford to make sure
that our slate is clean. If we do
have a clean slate, we will not have
to be bothered by an Un-American
Committee investigation."
It is high time that we face facts.
Miss Goldman in her letter, pub
lished in The Daily Juno 28. calls
McCarthy the "arch - subvert." I
suppose she is one of those who
deify Dean Acheson. It. was Ache
son, you will recall, who uttered
the now fnmous words: ''I will not
turn my back on Alger Hiss." It
•was Acheson who protected all
those from whom McCarthy tried
to protect his country. And the
State Department's Security Board
has since agreed with McCarthy in
a number of cases, as shown by
their labeling them as minimum se
curity risks.
I do not approve of all McCar
thy's tactics. He is melodramatic.
And if there is anything I hate it is
m» lodratnatics. Further, I feel sure
that he has made mistakes—as have
all men everywhere. George Wash
ington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham
Lincoln, Wooclrow Wilson, all these
men made mistakes. It is unfortu
nate that mankind cannot bo infal
lible. What we must realize is that
Senator McCarthy has, even with
his mistakes, made a contribution
to his country. We must be grateful
to him lor his contribution.
We must at the same time, as we
must with all men, weigh carefully
what he says. Mr. Quinn, while he
may know his law, shocks mo with
his statement: ''To identify McCar
thyism with patriotism is to equate
self-contradictory terms, for free
dom ol thought and inquiry are the
cornerstone of America."
Mr. Quinn, I take it, would deny
to Joseph McCarthy, citizen, the
freedom of thought and inquiry
which he at the same time labels
"the cornerstone of America." He
would also deny him freedom of

speech. He would also deny that
McCarthy is acting in accordance
with his patriotic fervor.
Let us not deceive ourselves, sir.
By trying to combat "McCarthy
ism," we are only serving as press
agents for it. But by shutting Mc-
Carthy up, we would not only be
violating the Constitution, we would
be depriving the country of the
views of one who, despite his faults
and errors, has rendered a service
to his country.
If we are to combat "McCarthy
ism," the most effective way is the
"silent treatment." Why is it that
editors the country over must spout
forth about "McCarthyism" at times
when the Senator has made no
widely publicized statements in the
recent past? I suspect that it is to
show forth their erudition to the
public, and to spice up their other
wise dull editorials with something
smacking of sensation. Again I say,
let us not deceive ourselves. By re
sorting to the sensationalism which
editors and columnists usually em
ploy in writing and speaking of Mc-
Carthy, they are usiny the same
tactics against which they and we
all are fighting.

value. In Her last paragraph she
says:
"It is up to Stanford to make sure
that our slate is clean. If we do
have a clean slate, we will not have
to be bothered by an Un-American
Committee investigation."
It is high time that we face facts.
Miss Goldman in her letter, pub
lished in The Daily Juno 28. calls
McCarthy the "arch - subvert." I
suppose she is one of those who
deify Dean Acheson. It. was Ache
son, you will recall, who uttered
the now fnmous words: ''I will not
turn my back on Alger Hiss." It
•was Acheson who protected all
those from whom McCarthy tried
to protect his country. And the
State Department's Security Board
has since agreed with McCarthy in
a number of cases, as shown by
their labeling them as minimum se
curity risks.
I do not approve of all McCar
thy's tactics. He is melodramatic.
And if there is anything I hate it is
m» lodratnatics. Further, I feel sure
that he has made mistakes—as have
all men everywhere. George Wash
ington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham
Lincoln, Wooclrow Wilson, all these
men made mistakes. It is unfortu
nate that mankind cannot bo infal
lible. What we must realize is that
Senator McCarthy has, even with
his mistakes, made a contribution
to his country. We must be grateful
to him lor his contribution.
We must at the same time, as we
must with all men, weigh carefully
what he says. Mr. Quinn, while he
may know his law, shocks mo with
his statement: ''To identify McCar
thyism with patriotism is to equate
self-contradictory terms, for free
dom ol thought and inquiry are the
cornerstone of America."
Mr. Quinn, I take it, would deny
to Joseph McCarthy, citizen, the
freedom of thought and inquiry
which he at the same time labels
"the cornerstone of America." He
would also deny him freedom of

speech. He would also deny that
McCarthy is acting in accordance
with his patriotic fervor.
Let us not deceive ourselves, sir.
By trying to combat "McCarthy
ism," we are only serving as press
agents for it. But by shutting Mc-
Carthy up, we would not only be
violating the Constitution, we would
be depriving the country of the
views of one who, despite his faults
and errors, has rendered a service
to his country.
If we are to combat "McCarthy
ism," the most effective way is the
"silent treatment." Why is it that
editors the country over must spout
forth about "McCarthyism" at times
when the Senator has made no
widely publicized statements in the
recent past? I suspect that it is to
show forth their erudition to the
public, and to spice up their other
wise dull editorials with something
smacking of sensation. Again I say,
let us not deceive ourselves. By re
sorting to the sensationalism which
editors and columnists usually em
ploy in writing and speaking of Mc-
Carthy, they are usiny the same
tactics against which they and we
all are fighting.
