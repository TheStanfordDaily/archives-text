# Clarifies Stand

To the Editor:
I feel obligated to clarify a few
points I made in my letter oi' July
24, 1953, which have been misinter
preted.
First of all, many people misun
derstood my statement concerning
the Communistic influence in our
clergy. 1 did not say our churches
were Communistic; I said that some
of our clergymen were Communists.
According to the "American Mer
cury oi July 1953, there are approx.
7,000 clergymen who are at present
affiliated with the Communist party.
Religion is an excellent immunity
for the Communist party because of
the sanctuary given to clergymen.
Once a clergyman is discovered to
be a Communist, it is very difficult
to remove him partly because of
complicated church regulations, and
partly because of the traditional re
spect accorded a "man of the cloth."
The Rev. Claude C. Williams, a
known Communist, said, in the July
27, 195J, issue oi "The Freeman,"
"Denominationally ! am a Presby
terian; religiously, a Unitarian; and
politically, I'm a Communist. I'm
not preaching to make people good
or anything of the sort. I'm in the
church because I can reach people
easier that way and get them
organized for Communism." This
statement is by one man; yet it
clearly shows the sentiment of
Communist clergymen. How can
we, the people of the United States,
protect ourselves against these so
caled disciples of Christ? There is
not much we can do if we start

I tearing our churches apart to find
Communism; we will have chaos,
and that i.s just what the Commu
nists want. The only thing we can
do is to follow Saint John's words,
"Beloved, believ# not every spirit,
but try the spirits which they are
i oi God: because many false proph
; cts are gone out into the world."
The next point I would like to
i clarify is the topic of Communist
' professors. According to J. B. Mat
thews, former research director of
the Un-American Activities Com
mittee, who said, in the "American
I Mercury" of April 22, 1953,
approx. 28 per cent of all top col
laborators with the deceitful Com
munist front - movement in recent
years have been college and univer
sity proiessors. Exhaustive research
into personnel ol the Communist
i front organization reveals that some
3,000 professors from approx. (>OO in
stitutions ot higher learning have
been affiliated more than 2G.000 times
with this instrument of the Com
munist party." This is not "guilt by
association" but "guilt by collabora
tion." There is only one term for
these professors—deadly agents of a
loreign state—and we, the students,
should recognize this fact.
The last major point I want to
bring up is the fact that many peo
ple believe that Senator McCarthy
has never proved any man a Com
munist. May I remind these people
of the infamous trials of Alger Hiss
and Owen Lattimore. Of course,
many people still consider these
! men as "red herrings." Ho. hum!
The Fifth Amendment, which was
written to protect a man from in
criminating himself, is slowly be

coining the "Fifth Column" Amend
ment. The"The Freeman" of June
29, 1953, states, "For this amend
ment with its provision that 'no per
son shall be compelled in any crim
inal case to be a witness against
himself,' is becoming the standard
refuge of witnesses who are unwill
ing to tell Congressional investigat
ing committees anything more than
their names and the time of day, if
that."
In closing I would like to say that
it seems that many people hate Sen
ator McCarthy more than they do
Communism. These people's minds
have already been warped by the
naive idea that the only way to rid
our country of the Communist men
ce is by protecting the Communists
behind the smoke screen of aca
demic freedom and "democratic lib
erties."
