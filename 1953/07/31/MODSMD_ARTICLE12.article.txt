# Strange Parallel

To the Editor:
It is a singular parallel that the
two particular and traditional ene
mies of Communism, namely, the
clergy and the teaching profession,
should become a special target for
Mr. McCarthy and a McCarthy fan,
Maureen Jameson, who spoke so
glowingly about the Senator, in a
recent letter to the editor.
Years ago, Karl Marx launched
the attack: "Religion is the opiate of
the masses." Lenin and Stalin fol
followed with brutal assaults upon
the clergy and the mass extermina

tion of the intelligentsia. Now Mc-
Carthy takes up the attack.
There are other strange similari
ties between the rantings of Senator
Joseph McCarthy anil the official
line of the Communist party.
Among the many cases that can
be cited to illustrate the point are:
(1) In 1945, McCarthy said, as he
was running for the Senate, "Sta
lin's proposal for world disarma
ment is a great thing and he must
be given credit for being sincere."
(2) He was elected by a scant
5,396 votes with the Communist
dominated unions in Milwaukee
providing the extra push to put him
over the top. Ordinarily, these un
ions voted heavily for LaFollette.
But in 1945, following LaFollette's
castigation of Soviet foreign policy,
they turned and voted for McCarthy,
(3) Earl Browder, you may re
member, was president of the Com
munist party in America. At one
time the government put the finger
on Browder and threatened to put
the man in jail on grounds of con
tempt of Congress. The case got
into the Federal District Court.
Dismissal denied. But Earl Browder
had a friend, a Senator, Joe Mc-
Carthy. Under a new judge, on
March 14, 1951, with McCarthy tes
tifying for Browder, the case was
dropped!
(4) McCarthy—at the very mo
ment that the Communists in East
Germany were beginning to heavily
recruit ex-Nazis into the new East
German Volkspartei—on the Senate
floor, gave a strirring speech, plead
