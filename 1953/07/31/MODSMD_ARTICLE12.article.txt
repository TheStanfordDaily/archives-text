# Strange Parallel
## 
### 
To the Editor:
It is a singular parallel that the
two particular and traditional ene
mies of Communism, namely, the
clergy and the teaching profession,
should become a special target for
Mr. McCarthy and a McCarthy fan,
Maureen Jameson, who spoke so
glowingly about the Senator, in a
recent letter to the editor.
Years ago, Karl Marx launched
the attack: "Religion is the opiate of
the masses." Lenin and Stalin fol
followed with brutal assaults upon
the clergy and the mass extermina

tion of the intelligentsia. Now Mc-
Carthy takes up the attack.
There are other strange similari
ties between the rantings of Senator
Joseph McCarthy anil the official
line of the Communist party.
Among the many cases that can
be cited to illustrate the point are:
(1) In 1945, McCarthy said, as he
was running for the Senate, "Sta
lin's proposal for world disarma
ment is a great thing and he must
be given credit for being sincere."
(2) He was elected by a scant
5,396 votes with the Communist
dominated unions in Milwaukee
providing the extra push to put him
over the top. Ordinarily, these un
ions voted heavily for LaFollette.
But in 1945, following LaFollette's
castigation of Soviet foreign policy,
they turned and voted for McCarthy,
(3) Earl Browder, you may re
member, was president of the Com
munist party in America. At one
time the government put the finger
on Browder and threatened to put
the man in jail on grounds of con
tempt of Congress. The case got
into the Federal District Court.
Dismissal denied. But Earl Browder
had a friend, a Senator, Joe Mc-
Carthy. Under a new judge, on
March 14, 1951, with McCarthy tes
tifying for Browder, the case was
dropped!
(4) McCarthy—at the very mo
ment that the Communists in East
Germany were beginning to heavily
recruit ex-Nazis into the new East
German Volkspartei—on the Senate
floor, gave a strirring speech, plead
ing for the relaxation of punish
ment against those Nazis respon
sible for the infamous Malmedv
murders.
(5) Immediately after the Soviets
had despaired of attempting to jam
the Voice of America with radio
transmitters, McCarthy finishes the
job very nicely.
((i) —The overseas libraries — and
particularly Amerika Haus, in Ger
many—were for a lorn; time a spe
cial target of Soviet propaganda.
Now we hear McCarthy attacking
the same target.
(7) McCarthy's anti - Semitism,
also, has a familiar and sinister ring.
Recently, at the same time when
Soviet anti-Semitism was at a high
peak, McCarthy ordered Gerald L.
K. Smith ' to get the proof" on "the
Zionist Jew, Anna M. Rosenberg."
(8) To continue the parallel, it is
well to cite McCarthy's voting rec
ord. In all but two cases he has
voted the line advocated by the
Kremlin. He has voted against the
North Atlantic Pact, aid to Euro
pean and Asian allies, most meas
ures sought by the administration to
fight Communism overseas.
(9) Now we find the churches and
schools—always a prime target of
Communism — a target for McCar
thy.
Is the coincidence amusing?
"What if it were alarming? We are
all aware of his odious financial
dealings, his lengthy debts to the
Lustron Corporation and to the U.S.
government. What is the signifi
cance of this strange pattern of ac
tion and questionable moral ethics?
From all these dramatic issues, I
can draw some rather nasty con
clusions. You, Miss Jameson, ad
mire the man. For what incredible
reason ' KENNETH PAULI

member, was president of the Com

time the government put the finger
on Browder and threatened to put
the man in jail on grounds of con

into the Federal District Court.
Dismissal denied. But Earl Browder
had a friend, a Senator, Joe Mc-
Carthy. Under a new judge, on
March 14, 1951, with McCarthy tes

dropped!
(4) McCarthy—at the very mo

Germany were beginning to heavily
recruit ex-Nazis into the new East
German Volkspartei—on the Senate
floor, gave a strirring speech, plead

ment against those Nazis respon
sible for the infamous Malmedv
murders.

also, has a familiar and sinister ring.
Recently, at the same time when
Soviet anti-Semitism was at a high
peak, McCarthy ordered Gerald L.

Zionist Jew, Anna M. Rosenberg."

well to cite McCarthy's voting rec

voted the line advocated by the
Kremlin. He has voted against the
North Atlantic Pact, aid to Euro

ures sought by the administration to
fight Communism overseas.

Communism — a target for McCar

Is the coincidence amusing?

It is a singular parallel that the

clergy and the teaching profession,

glowingly about the Senator, in a
recent letter to the editor.
Years ago, Karl Marx launched
the attack: "Religion is the opiate of
the masses." Lenin and Stalin fol
followed with brutal assaults upon
the clergy and the mass extermina

There are other strange similari
ties between the rantings of Senator
Joseph McCarthy anil the official
line of the Communist party.
Among the many cases that can
be cited to illustrate the point are:
(1) In 1945, McCarthy said, as he
was running for the Senate, "Sta
lin's proposal for world disarma
ment is a great thing and he must
be given credit for being sincere."
(2) He was elected by a scant
5,396 votes with the Communist
dominated unions in Milwaukee
providing the extra push to put him
over the top. Ordinarily, these un
ions voted heavily for LaFollette.
