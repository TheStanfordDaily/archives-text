There's another angle to this Little League baseball madness besides
jhe vast interest and number of kids and parents who are actively taking
part.
As materialistic as it may sound, someone is making money out of
the deal. And you know who it is? No one else but the retailers, whole
salers. and manufacturers of hasehall equipment.
G. Marvin Shutt, secretary o! the National Sporting Goods Association,
has estimated that this year there will be an equipment sale increase of
almost one-half from last year. That would bring sales from 20 million
dollars to 30 million. And last year's figure of 20 million was more than
triple the sales figure recorded in pre-war 1939. And he lays the cause
directly to the boom in kids' baseball.

We are always hearing of that "good old college spirit." They say spirit
.is what makes the boys play harder. It's that rah-rah.
But you don't often expect to find it in the pro ranks where the boys
play for pay and each day go to work just like anyone else.
But the pros have spirit. Only recently ex-Stanford baseballers Jack
Shcpard, Chuck Essegian, and Boh Murphy commented with surprise
on the fine spirit of their respective pro teams. They called it as good as
if not better than the spirit they knew in college.
And in football Visco Grgieh, who just retired from the San Francisco
Forty-Niners because of an injury, has this to say, "We had the old do-or
die fight. I never was on a team in high school, college, or in the Army
that had as much of it as the Forty-Niners. And it helped a lot. We
won plenty of games we had no right to win because we were loaded with
spirit and hustle."

There should he some degree of conflict this fall when visiting root
ing sections find themselves surrounded by Stanford season-ticket hold
ers on the Stadium's shady side. The rest of the Stanford support has
been moved to the sunny side for reasons of hospitality. But as an in
ducement to season-ticket buyers, they remain in the cooler and better
located seats. And perhaps those who pledge themselves to a season's
support are the most loyal and staunchest rooters. No telling what will
happen when they mix with the visitors. United we stand, divided we
fall.

While on the subject of football we picked up some quotes, all by
Chuck Taylor, when he addressed Phi Delta Kappa, men's honorary edu
cation fraternity, earlier this week. We shall pass them on.
"We are feeling very happy about our team and the no-platoon
ruling. We believe we have a greater opportunity to field a better team."

'Bobby Garrett has bad bis j
shoulder operated upon, and the
quarterback who can throw bet
ter than Gary Kerkorian wired us
the other day that lie is just fine
and all ready for fall."
"Stanford will have cycles of
winning and losing. However, our
win cycles will be shorter and our
losing cycles longer than most
schools."
"Football today is simplified :
over 10-15 years ago. There are
less plays by any single !
team."

Shcpard, Chuck Essegian, and Boh Murphy commented with surprise
on the fine spirit of their respective pro teams. They called it as good as
if not better than the spirit they knew in college.
And in football Visco Grgieh, who just retired from the San Francisco
Forty-Niners because of an injury, has this to say, "We had the old do-or
die fight. I never was on a team in high school, college, or in the Army
that had as much of it as the Forty-Niners. And it helped a lot. We
won plenty of games we had no right to win because we were loaded with
spirit and hustle."

There should he some degree of conflict this fall when visiting root
ing sections find themselves surrounded by Stanford season-ticket hold
ers on the Stadium's shady side. The rest of the Stanford support has
been moved to the sunny side for reasons of hospitality. But as an in
ducement to season-ticket buyers, they remain in the cooler and better
located seats. And perhaps those who pledge themselves to a season's
support are the most loyal and staunchest rooters. No telling what will
happen when they mix with the visitors. United we stand, divided we
fall.

While on the subject of football we picked up some quotes, all by
Chuck Taylor, when he addressed Phi Delta Kappa, men's honorary edu
cation fraternity, earlier this week. We shall pass them on.
"We are feeling very happy about our team and the no-platoon
ruling. We believe we have a greater opportunity to field a better team."

'Bobby Garrett has bad bis j
shoulder operated upon, and the
quarterback who can throw bet
ter than Gary Kerkorian wired us
the other day that lie is just fine
and all ready for fall."
"Stanford will have cycles of
winning and losing. However, our
win cycles will be shorter and our
losing cycles longer than most
schools."
"Football today is simplified :
over 10-15 years ago. There are
less plays by any single !
team."
There's another angle to this Little League baseball madness besides
jhe vast interest and number of kids and parents who are actively taking
part.
As materialistic as it may sound, someone is making money out of
the deal. And you know who it is? No one else but the retailers, whole
salers. and manufacturers of hasehall equipment.
G. Marvin Shutt, secretary o! the National Sporting Goods Association,
has estimated that this year there will be an equipment sale increase of
almost one-half from last year. That would bring sales from 20 million
dollars to 30 million. And last year's figure of 20 million was more than
triple the sales figure recorded in pre-war 1939. And he lays the cause
directly to the boom in kids' baseball.

We are always hearing of that "good old college spirit." They say spirit
.is what makes the boys play harder. It's that rah-rah.
But you don't often expect to find it in the pro ranks where the boys
play for pay and each day go to work just like anyone else.
But the pros have spirit. Only recently ex-Stanford baseballers Jack
Shcpard, Chuck Essegian, and Boh Murphy commented with surprise
on the fine spirit of their respective pro teams. They called it as good as
if not better than the spirit they knew in college.
And in football Visco Grgieh, who just retired from the San Francisco
