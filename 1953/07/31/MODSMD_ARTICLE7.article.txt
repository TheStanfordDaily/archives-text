# FACULTY ATTEND EXCOM
## Honor Code issue Debated 
### 
Should students have the right to take examination papers from
classrooms?
This was the key and exciting guestion that kept the summer
Executive Committee, a dozen interested students, Dean of Stu
dents H. Donald Winbigler, and Professor Raymond Harriman of

the Classics Department
in debate for three hours Wed
nesday night.
The issue was put before the
Executive Committee by Dean
Winbigler and others who pointed
out that the present Honor Code
contains no specific regulation
governing the taking of examina
tions from the classroom. The
dean reported that many mem
bers of the administration and
faculty are anxious for a clear
cut rule.
Three possible solutions to the
problem were advanced during the
lengthy session.
1. Dean Winbigler suggested that
the practice of leaving classrooms
be curtailed and that faculty mem
bers giving examinations be made
the final judge of who can leave
class with test papers.
2. Chuck Cioff, who will head
the Honor Code Committee next
school year, recommended that
the Honor Code be amended to
give students the unquestioned
right to leave class during tests.
He further suggested that the is
sue be submitted to the student
body by referendum in the fall.
3. Kay Watson, women's hall rep
resentative on the Executive Com
mittee, oflered a compromise plan,
suggesting that the faculty establish
auxiliary rooms away from assigned
rooms where students could take
their tests.
Executive Committee members,
after hearing the pros and cons of
these various proposals, put off until
next week the making of a decision
on the matter. Any decision made
by the summer legislative group
will be merely advisory and will be
submitted to the regularly elected
Executive Committee when it con
venes in the fall.
Dean Winbigler kickcd off the
debate with a stern warning that
unless something is done, and
quickly, to stem what he called
the "inas.s exodus" from class
rooms during examinations, "we
are headed for catastrophe."
Reviewing the history of the
Honor Code, the dean pointed out
that the students, through their
elected councils, have the undis
puted right to settle to the issue.
He advised that the faculty,
through the Academic Council,
which is the legislative body of the
faculty, in 1921 turned over the full
administration of conduct in exami
nations to the students.
He warned, however, that unless
student action is forthcoming in the
fall, the Academic Council might
feel compelled to take action on its
own.
Professor Harriman, head of the
Classics Department and a faculty
member here for 25 years, ap
pealed to the student legislators
to find a solution for the problem
before the faculty "is forced to
step in."
"It's your responsibility," he em
phasized.
Next Goff presented his proposal,
arguing that the trust and honor
imposed on a student leaving the
classroom, in most cases, provides a
lessen that will never be forgotten.
In her compromise plan, Miss
Watson rtvommended that auxiliary
testing rooms be made available
where ludents could smoke or type.

He further suggested that the is
sue be submitted to the student
body by referendum in the fall.
3. Kay Watson, women's hall rep
resentative on the Executive Com
mittee, oflered a compromise plan,
suggesting that the faculty establish
auxiliary rooms away from assigned
rooms where students could take
their tests.
Executive Committee members,
after hearing the pros and cons of
these various proposals, put off until
next week the making of a decision
on the matter. Any decision made
by the summer legislative group
will be merely advisory and will be
submitted to the regularly elected
Executive Committee when it con
venes in the fall.
Dean Winbigler kickcd off the
debate with a stern warning that
unless something is done, and
quickly, to stem what he called
the "inas.s exodus" from class
rooms during examinations, "we
are headed for catastrophe."
Reviewing the history of the
Honor Code, the dean pointed out
that the students, through their
elected councils, have the undis
puted right to settle to the issue.
He advised that the faculty,
through the Academic Council,
which is the legislative body of the
faculty, in 1921 turned over the full
administration of conduct in exami
nations to the students.
He warned, however, that unless
student action is forthcoming in the
fall, the Academic Council might
feel compelled to take action on its
own.
Professor Harriman, head of the
Classics Department and a faculty
member here for 25 years, ap
pealed to the student legislators
to find a solution for the problem
before the faculty "is forced to
step in."
"It's your responsibility," he em
phasized.
Next Goff presented his proposal,
arguing that the trust and honor
imposed on a student leaving the
classroom, in most cases, provides a
lessen that will never be forgotten.
In her compromise plan, Miss
Watson rtvommended that auxiliary
testing rooms be made available
where ludents could smoke or type.
Should students have the right to take examination papers from
classrooms?
This was the key and exciting guestion that kept the summer
Executive Committee, a dozen interested students, Dean of Stu
dents H. Donald Winbigler, and Professor Raymond Harriman of

the Classics Department
in debate for three hours Wed
nesday night.
The issue was put before the
Executive Committee by Dean
Winbigler and others who pointed
out that the present Honor Code
contains no specific regulation
governing the taking of examina
tions from the classroom. The
dean reported that many mem
bers of the administration and
faculty are anxious for a clear
cut rule.
Three possible solutions to the
problem were advanced during the
lengthy session.
1. Dean Winbigler suggested that
the practice of leaving classrooms
be curtailed and that faculty mem
bers giving examinations be made
the final judge of who can leave
class with test papers.
2. Chuck Cioff, who will head
the Honor Code Committee next
school year, recommended that
the Honor Code be amended to
give students the unquestioned
right to leave class during tests.
He further suggested that the is
sue be submitted to the student
body by referendum in the fall.
