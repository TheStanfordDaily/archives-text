# Excom Seeks Solution to Code Rift
## 
### 
The summer Executive Com
mittee will again tackle the stub
born question whether or not
students should have the right
to leave the classroom during an
examination when it meets to
morrow night in its last sched
uled session of the quarter in the
SSU committee room in the Ni
ry. Meeting time is 7:30.
""hen, it is expected, the commit
members wil frame an advisory
to be submitted to the regu
larly elected Executive Committee
vhich convenes in the full.
The summer Executive Commit
tee is without power to make any
permanent legislation.
Judging by conversations with
va r i ous Executive Committee
members, it would seem that
opinion in the committee is sharp
ly divided on the issue, with some
representatives backing the ad
ministration position as expressed
by Dean of Students 11. Donald
Winbigler, and others standing
with Chuck Goft', who will head
the Honor Code Committee during
the next school year.
Dean Winbigler and Goff present
ed their opposing views to the sum
mer Excom at its meeting last Wed
nesday.
The dean told the student legis
lators that unless something Ls done
j curb students from leaving the
classroom during an examination a
"catastrophe" will result. He sug
gested that individual faculty mem-
Sers giving examinations be made
„he final judge of who can leave a
classroom with test papers.
Goflr. on the other hand, held
firmly that students should have
the unrestricted and undisputed
right to leave a classroom. Such
a right, he said, is part of the
spirit of the Honor Code.
A. third and compromise plan was
advanced by Kay Watson, women's
halls representative, who recom
mended that auxiliary smoking and
typing rooms be made available
