# Honor Code Controversy
## 
### 
The full seriousness of the controversy over whether students
should have the right to leave classrooms during examinations
was driven home to summer Executive Committee members and
other students for the first time last Wednesday night when Dean
of Students H. Donald Winbigler and Professor Raymond D. Har
riman of the Classics Department revealed faculty thinking on
the subject.
According to the two faculty men, many on the teaching staff
ate disturbed by the increasing number of students who take their
test papers from assigned classrooms.
Some faculty members, according to Dr. Harriman, have brand
ed the situation "scandalous."
Dean Winbigler told the Executive Committee that, in his opin
ion, the number of students leaving class with test papers has
become a "mass exodus."
"Something must be done," he insisted. Otherwise, he said,
"the University is headed for catastrophe."
The Dean pointed out that there is no stipulation within the
Honor Code granting such a privilege. He asserted that students
have "usurped" the right since the close of World War 11.
Chuck Goff, chairman-designate of the Honor Code Committee
next year, on the other hand insists that the right to leave a class
room is in perfect keeping with the spirit and meaning of the
Honor Code.
It is his contention that the Honor Code should be amended to
grant specifically and without question the right to take exam
papers from class.
The Dean holds that the Honor Code should be amended to give
faculty members the clear right to judge for themselves which stu
dents should be granted the privilege.
Goff and Winbigler represent two extremes of the controversy,
perhaps the sharpest to be raised this quarter.
Tomorrow evening the Executive Committee should declare its
stand.
What its answer will be is hard to tell now. It is known that
opinion on the issue differs considerably within the membership.
However, this problem is not for the Executive Committee to
ponder alone. This is also your problem. We urge you, therefore,
to study the matter and then express your opinion, either at to
morrow's Executive Committee meeting or to your Excom repre
sentative or through the Campus Opinion column in The Daily.
