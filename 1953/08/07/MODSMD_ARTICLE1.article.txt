# Ex-Army Man, 2 Educators Debate College Red Probes
## 
### 
A doughty ex-lieutenant colo
nel of the Army vigorously de
fended the right of legislative
committees, both state and na
tional, to investigate "Commu
nist influences" in universities
in a hard - hitting debate in
crowded Cubberley Auditorium
yesterday afternoon.
But two educators, one an in
structor from the University of Cal
ifornia in Berkeley, the other a vis
iting professor here, disclaimed that
committees had such a right.
The ex - Army officer, Wheaton
Brewer, currently executive adver
tising director for the California
Farmer's Magazine, quoting fre
quently from the published reports
of California's Un-American Activ
ities Committee and the U.S. Sen
ate's Committee on Internal Secu

ritv, claimed there are Communists
1 active in universities and schools of
1 the nation and that they must lx?
j exposed. In 1948,. he said, there
were 1.500 cited Communists or
dupes in American schools.
And.he said, the American peo
ple should co-operate with the
committees in their investigations.
He admitted, however that
there is room for improvement in
the procedural operation of the
committees. But until such
changes are made, he said, we
should bear with them.
'"The public must know,"he said,
j about Communist influence. An
j aroused public opinion, he asserted,
l is, perhaps, the most effective weap
: on against subversion. He insisted
that "subversives" be dismissed
| from teaching jobs.
Quiet-spoken John 11. Edwards,
instructor in English in UC, de
clared that the best criterion for
determining whether an instruc
tor should be dismissed is profes
sional competence. Such compe
tence, he said, is measured by the
quality of an instructor's teach
ing and his moral behavior.
He questioned whether a legisla
tive investigating committee was
! able to judge professional compe
tence.
The young instructor claimed that
1 the academic community is nur
tured on the "free enterprise of
! ideas" and cannot exist if external
1 control is imposed .
Also speaking against the investi
| gating committees was visiting Pro
fessor Monrad Paulson of the law
school. He cited three reasons why
an open investigation of universities
would be harmful.
First, he said, such an invest -
i igation would invite "the disrup
j tion of the faculty." It would
, cause, he declared, a dissipation
| of energy and a waste of time that
; could be bettev spent in study and
i research. t
Secondly, he went on, an investi
| gation would tend "to create mis
trust and suspicion within a body

of scholars." This in turn would
mean less freedom, he said.
In an atmosphere of suspicion and
fear academicians would "become
afraid to talk," he asserted.
'"They would become cautious.
And this would mean a decline in
the interchange of ideas."
Thirdly, he concluded, a probe is
dangerous because there is little
way "to hold it within reasonable
bounds."
Following the formal presenta
tion of arguments by the three
speakers, the debate was thrown
open to questions from the floor.
Of the several questions asked,
most were directed at Brewer.
Brewer was asked by several in
the audience exactly what he meant
by "Communist" and by "Commu
nist influence."
The ramrod-stiff ex-cavalryman
declared "a Communist is a man
who has been or who is a card
carrying member or who is secretly
pledged to the Communist cause."
Brewer, however, tried to hedge
on the second question, that about
"Communist influence."
But Paulson jumped him, asking
if John Dewey were alive would he
be considered subversive and a sub
ject for dismissal from a university
faculty. Brewer had mentioned
Dewey in his formal presentation,
saying that he spread ideas foreign
to traditional American republican
ism.
The ex-cavalryman shifted un
comfortably.
But before he could answer Ed
wards asked if he thought Henry
James, if he were living and was on
a faculty, should be dismissed.
"Both of them are instrumental
ists," Brewer declared.
"I don't think James ever had an
idea of instrumentalism in his whole
life," Edwards said quietly.
"Would you fire them?" insisted
Paulson.
Yes, was the answer.
Several members of the audience
rose, claiming that Deweyism is far
