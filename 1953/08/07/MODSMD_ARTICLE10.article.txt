ASSU by-laws covering the tak
ing of examinations from class
rooms, the summer Executive
Committee also went on record
as favoring a change in its vot
ing membership.

According to Kirk the Village
representatives have shown little
interest during this and past sum

are graduate students, and most
are married.

tempts to interest Villagers in stu
dent government but has failed.

of the busier organizations during
the summer.
