The Army calls us and answer we must in a few days. But before we

The arrival of an unusually ornate Stanford football prospectus put out
; by the Athletic Publicity Department could well be heralding a successful
J Stanford year. If the team is as good as the brochure prepared by brand

Besides the usual biographies and statistics, an entire section in the
pocket-size book is devoted to the booming ofjineman Norm Manoogian.
Many think, and justifiably so, that Manoogian is All-America material.
And the drive is on to see that he gets what is due him. Publicity is

If you want to see football at its roughest, dirtiest, and most com
petitive, drop up to Menlo College any afternoon but Sunday about 3 and
watch the professional Forty-Niners cut each others' throats. There has

brutal. And no one gets paid, beyond expenses, for the training period.
Those that get cut receive nothing.

them more hustle and fight than school boys. lie is well on his way to
being voted Minor League Manager of the Year by his contemporaries.

And on baseball, the most crucial
series in American League play
could be the one on tap this week
end when the White Sox meet the
Yankees in four games. A Yankee
series win would just about kill all
Chicago hopes, while a Sox major
ity will continue to keep things in
teresting.
