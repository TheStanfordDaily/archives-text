# CODE AMENDMENT URGED
## Excom Says Students Should Have Right to Leave Classes 
### 
The summer Executive Committee, in its last meeting of the
Quarter Wednesday, decided by a three-to-two vote to recommend
to next term's Executive Committee that the by-laws of the ASSU
constitution be amended to give students the undoubted right to
leave examination rooms with their test papers.
The close decision came after more than two hours of heated
discussion.
And there was indication that if Student Body President Fran
Kirk had been able to exercise his vote he would have cast agains:

the decision, thus tying the mat
ter up. However, the president,
under ASSU rules, can vote only
in the case of deadlock.
In a second recommendation on
the issue, the Executive Committee,
again by a three-to-two vote, sug
gested that a thorough public rela
tions campaign be initiated in the

fall directed at educating instruc
tors and students alike in the tenets
of the Honor Code.
This second recommendation
further stressed that if the pro
posed amendment were adopted
faculty members, though they
could not order students to re
main in classrooms, could, if they
wished, request them to do so.
If a student rudely refused to
abide with such a request, commit
tee members indicated, he could be
charged with violating the Funda
mental Standard.
The second recommendation was
made because some members of the
committee felt the "positive nature"
of the first amendment might cause
premature controversy.
A full education program, some
members indicated, must be estab
lished before any concrete action is
taken next year.
The motion to amend the by
laws was made by Jim Banks,
summer student manager, and
seconded by Martin Perlberger,
graduate representative. It pro
vides for the following addition to
Article One of the bv-laws:
"The students shall have the priv
ilege of taking examinations from
examination rooms."
That addition, if adopted, will be
attached to the existing section on
the Honor Code, reading:
"The University on its part mani
fests its confidence in the honor of
the students by refraining from
proctoring examinations or taking
special steps to prevent" giving or
receiving aid in examinations and
other school work.
Voting for the recommendation
were Kay Watson, women's rep
resentative; Chuck Kashima, men's
representative; and Perlberger.
Voting against were Martin Arm
brust, men's hall representative,
and Lucie Welles, summer vice
president.
Kirk, after the vote was taken,
said he would have voted against
the measure.
The second recommendation, the
one dealing with the public rela
tions campaign and the teacher's
privilege to ask but not tell a stu
dent to stay in a classroom, was ad
vanced by Chuck Kashima.
Kashima, Miss Watson, and Miss
Welles voted armatively, and Arm
brust and Perlberger negatively.
The second recommendation
reads:
"In view of the positive nature of
the recommendation (as above), the
summer Executive Committee
stresses also the public relations
part which should consist of clarify
ing to the Academic Council that a
faculty member can request that
students not leave the room."
Several times during the lengthy
session, Executive Committee mem
bers clashed sharply over contro
versial points.
