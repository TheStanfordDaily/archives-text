# CAMPUS OPINION
## ‘An Excellent Example’ 
### 
To the Editor:
Miss Maureen Jameson's letter, published in the July 31 issue of your
paper, is an excellent example of the manner in which American ideals
of justice are perverted or ignored under the guise of fighting Communism.
Miss Jameson writes: "... I would like to clarify . . . the topic of
Communist professors. According to J. B. Matthews .. . etc., etc. She
states Mr. Matthews' indictment and uses it as a fact! This is Mr. Mat
thews' opinion. It does not constitute proof of guilt. The pre-McCarthy
American way was to consider a man innocent until proven guilty at a
trial by a jury of his peers. Evidently this is not Miss Jameson's way.
She considers that 3,000 professors are proven guilty ..by Mr. Matthews'
accusations and uses his accusations (which caused the U.S. Government
to accept his resignation) to document her argument.
In the following paragraph Mi.ss Jameson cites the men Senator Mc-
Carthy has "proven" to be Communists: "May I remind these people of
the infamous trials of Alger Hiss and Owen Lattimore?" May I, in turn,
;remind Miss Jameson of the fact that Alger Hiss was exposed by the House
Committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. Nixon? Senator McCarthy had
nothing to do with it.
And as for the infamous trial of Owen Lattimore, the latest published
information available to the writer stated that he was under indictment
01 seven counts of perjury, four of which were subsequently rejected by
Judge Youngdahl. Mr. Lattimore is to stand trial for the remaining three
in October of this year. Is this the "infamous trial" Miss Jameson refers
to. or is she calling Senator McCarthy's truly infamous hearings a trial?
3 call these hearings infamous because Senator McCarthy is a member of
the legislative branch of the government and the judicial power of the
government is vested in the judicial branch (Constitution of the United
States, Article 3. Sections 1 and 2).
The Communist form of government, for Miss Jameson's information,
fuses the legislative, executive and judicial powers in one authoritative
body. I should also like to call her attention to the Communist principle
of assuming that if a man is accused, he is guilty.
