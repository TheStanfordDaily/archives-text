# Lag 'Farm Fairâ€™ Plans Being Made
## 
### 
Plans are currently being laid for
the Lagunita Court "Farm Fair" to
be held at the Court Oct. 3.
Proceeds from the fair are used
to purchase CARE packages for an
Austrian village. St. Johann. The
village was "adopted" by Lagunita
several years ago. Since then, the
fair has become an annual event.
The fair will feature dancing, door
prizes, and various booths, includ
ing a foreign bazaar.
