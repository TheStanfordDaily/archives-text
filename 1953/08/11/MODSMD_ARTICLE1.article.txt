## 
### 
Every opportunity" will be;
jaded by the Board of Trus
es to a group of Stanford Med
:al School faculty members to |
.eep the Stanford Hospital in J
ian Francisco open, it was an
ounced Friday by Lloyd Din
lspiel, president of the Board.
Dinkelspiol's announcement fol
wed close on the heels of a deci
>n by 82 members of the school's [
acuity to organize as tin- Stanford j
linical Group and attempt to main- ]
un not only tin* Stanford Hospi-|
• I's private wards hut its charity
urds and its charity out - patient
j r vice.
Also, the group hopes to organize
the hospital, perhaps with the |
Ip of the University, a post-grad
ate school of medicine, which
ould be the first such organized in i
the West.
The action of the Stanford Clin
ical Group was taken after the
Board, in a meeting July 1(>, de
nied to move the Stanford Medi
cal School from its headquarters
in the hospital to (lie main Palo
Alto campus. With such a move,
the Hoard planned to abandon the j
hospital.
The move, it is expected, will be
>mpleted within three to live years.
The action taken by the Clinical
iroup apparently won immediate
•jproval of Board members.
In ;i statement issued Friday,
Inkelspiel said:
"The University's trustees view
with sympathy and open minds the !
ntontions of these Stanford doc- I
:ors. We have assured the faculty
:hat there will be no hasty disposal I
v the trustees of the hospital prop
erties. Every opportunity will be
jiven to them to work out with the j
University, or independently, as
may develop, a program for the use
>1 the facilities, if that proves to be j
at all feasible.
"Last Monday I appointed Dean 1
Loren R. Chandler chairman of a j
study committee to examine the fu- |
are disposition of the Medical |
'ehool's physical plant in San Fran
i-00, including the suggested possi
llity of its use for postgraduate ]
v.u.i ical instruction."
li the Hoard decides to allow
the Clinical Group to maintain j
the hospital, it is virtually certain
that it will insist that it he oper- j
ated on a self - sustaining basis. I
There would be no question of
charging any rent or other assess
ments.
The San Francisco Chronicle, in!
reporting the hospital story, quoted |
Pinkelspiel as saying:
"If a program is developed for
;i postgraduate school of medicine
..older Stanford auspices, main
tained on a self-supporting basis,
1 feel confident that the trustees
v\ould make the facilities avail- j
able for that purpose."
Such a school, if organized, would \
•e run as a special department un- |
der University jurisdiction.
According to Dr. Robert A. Scar
-1 borough, clinical professor of sur
gery and chairman of the Clinical
j Group, the postgraduate school
would grant, through the University,
| degrees of Master of Science in sur
gery, radiology, internal medicine,
pediatrics, and other phases of med
! icine.
The school would also provide
j "refresher" courses.
Revenue from the hospital, which
over the past lew years has shown
a modest profit, would finance the
j school.
