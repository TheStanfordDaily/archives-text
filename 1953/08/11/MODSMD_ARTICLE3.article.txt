## 
### 
The suggestion that there are subversives on the Stanford fac
ulty made during a debate here Thursday on legislative investigat
ing committees drew sharp retorts from several members of the
faculty over the weekend.
Wheaton Brewer, an ex-Army officer and currently executive

advertising director for Califor-'*
ilia Farmer's Magazine, in de-!
[ending the right of legislative j
.'ommittees to probe "Communist
influences" in universities, said:
"I could quote from the faculty
of this University the names of
many members whose motives are
open to question."
When approached by reporters
ifter the Cubberley Auditorium de
bate and asked to elaborate, he said
the names were contained in a just
published report of the Dilworth in
vestigative committee of the State
Legislature.
He diil not mention the name of
my professor allegedly cited.
Commenting on the suggestion,
Dr. Virnil K. Whitaker of the Eng
lish Department said:
"If by 'question' he means Com
munist influence, his statement is
outrageous and the kind of loose
talking that constitutes the most
serious menace to the American
way of life at this time. As
phrased, the statement is so vague
it is impossible to comment on it
intelligently."
Philip YV. Harsh, professor of
classics, stated:
"This seems to me a very rash
statement he made. Of course, it's
a very vague statement."
Dr. Thomas A. Bailey, head of
the History Department, declared:
"I know of no card-carrying Com
munist, or anyone on the faculty
who comes close to being one."
A spokesman for the University
said he was "unaware of any com
mittee called the Dilworth commit
tee. If the speaker was referring to

the Burns committee, of which Dil
worth is a member, the recent
Burns report makes no such refer
ence to Stanford faculty members.
The only reference is a compliment
to Stanford and all universities of
the state for their co-operation with
the committee.
