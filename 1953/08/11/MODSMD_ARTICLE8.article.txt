# Interesting and Pleasant
## 
### 
Another few days and summer quarter will be a memory. And,
looking back over the eventful two months, it would seem that the
quarter will stand out for most of us as a pleasant and interesting
period.
Not only were we treated to outstanding instruction from both
regular and visiting members of the faculty, but also we were
offered an astounding range of extra-curricular activities.
Never before has so much been offered, claim veterans of past
summers here. Never, they say, has the level of student activity
during a summer been of such high caliber.
They point with pride to the weekly discussions on academic
freedom and the debate on investigating committees.
They further cite the fine reception given the outdoor concert
here last month.
Truly it can be said that the summer activities have been well
planned to appeal to all students.
The success of these various events was due to the hard work
of many people. Some of them, like Vice-President Lucie Welles
and Student Manager Jim Banks and President Fran Kirk, can be
particularly cited for the many hours of hard work they put in
planning and overseeing ASSU affairs.
President Kirk has done, in our estimation, a notable job in
sparking what usually is the dullest quarter at Stanford, activity
wise, into an exciting, entertaining, and informative session.
He was the spark-plug behind the discussions on academic free
dom and the debate. Too, he was an impartial, clear-thinking mod
erator over the aftair3 of the Executive Committee, a hard job,
especially considering the problems raised this summer.
Usually a summer Executive Committee makes a few minor de
cisions that are quickly forgotten. But this summer, the Executive
Committee went on record as favoring a revision of the Honor
Code to give students the undisputed right to take their examina
tions out of an examination room.
The final decision on the matter will come sometime in the fall,
most likely after much discussion.
Yes, the summer has been an eventful one. Far more so than
we expected.
Well, good-bye for now. And best of luck with the exams.
