## Honor Code Issue Reviewed 
### 
To the Editor:
The Academic Council instituted the Honor Code in 1921 in these
words:
"Responsibility for honesty in examinations is hereby placed upon the
students of the University."
The concept that this Honor Code entails the right of a student to write
his exam wherever he pleases has been assumed by students. There is no
positive rule in existence which states whether or not this right exists.
The need for a positive rule to cover this situation was made obvious
last spring when certain faculty members noted with alarm the increasing ;
tendency for students to write exams outside the classroom. They ques- j
tinned the right to do so.
It is the interest of the Fundamental Standard Committee that the
students of the University formulate a governing rule, either through
their elected representatives or by themselves at a referendum.
Three alternative solutions have been suggested:
a) To allow students the undeniable right to write their exams wher- j
lever they please. This was the recommendation passed by Summer Ex- <
ccm by a 3 to 2 vote last Wednesday. This is consistent with the concept
that the true aim of an Honor Code is to instill in the student the habit
of honesty and responsibility. It is done by letting him face situations in
which he must choose whether to be honest or dishonest. This point of
view places a greater value upon the educational potential of the Honor
Code than upon the protection of academic standards.
b) Not to allow students to leave a given exam room. This would
the sanctions of social pressure and "third person responsi
bility" to report observed violations. This device is consistent with the
conception that an Honor CocU) exists primarily to minimize cheating and !
only secondarily to educate.
c) To give the instructor of a class the task of deciding whether or not
his class may Write their exams where they please or must do so only
in an assigned room. This solution would return this part of the Honor
Code to faculty control. But it would serve to alleviate the qualms ot
â€¢acuity members' who feel that the unrestricted right to leave exam rooms
imposes a marked academic disadvantage upon students ot integrity. In
this way it would protect the Honor Code from possible alteration or abo
lition by the Academic Council.
To recognize the conceptual differences which underlie each of these
alternatives is a necessity in understanding the current discussion. Is
the Honor Code an educational vehicle for the ethical aspect of our college
training? Or is its primary job the maintenance of optimum academic fair
ness? Or should this problem be tossed back at the faculty in order to
remove a situation which may open the Honor Code to surgery by the
body which established it? The decision lies with the students of this j
University
