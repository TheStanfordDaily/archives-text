# Frosh, We Envy You
## 
### 
Frosh, we envy you.
You have four years, maybe more, of Stan
ford University, with its exciting life and study,
to look forward to, while some of us are wind
ing up our scholastic careers.
We would like to be in your shoes, we think,
aagerly pacing the Quad for the first time, see
ing the golden fagade of Memorial Church, the
expansive view from Hoover Tower, the won
drous green of Frost Memorial Amphitheater.
We would like to retrace some of our steps
at Stanford and start, in some cases, anew; for
the opportunities of learning—for tasting the
thoughts of a .thousand intellectual currents —
are many and varied, and looking back we real
ize that we have missed much.
For you, however, the way is clear. The fu
ture at Stanford lies open invitingly before you.
And included in that future are items that
will remain fixed always in mind.
Among them are the sometimes maddening,
but always exhilarating, debates about religion
and politics and economics that spring con
stantly from discussion in Western Civilization
classes; the discovery of old and new authors;
the challenge of Tuesday Evening Series.
What advantage you take of these and other
distinctive features of the University, of course,
is entirely up to you.
This you most likely understand. And, no
doubt, some of you, anxious to be on your own
at last, find this excitingly satisfying.
For, from here on out at Stanford, you will

be looked upon as mature, as being capable
of knowing and expressing your own mind.
It is a marvelous trust, one that Stanford ex
tends with unflinching faith, marking its atti
tude with such an expressive program as the
Honor Code.
As you most likely realize, there are few col
leges and almost no high schools in which you
can find such a genuine expression of trust. For
most of you it will be a new and, we dare say,
personally meaningful experience to take un
proctored examinations.
Stanford, in exchange for its trust, however,
expects much of you, representing, as you do,
the largest first-year class in the history of the
institution.
It expects, above all, high, clear, purposeful
thinking.
It expects also that you approach your stud
ies with tolerance and objectivity, not with the
narrow prejudice characteristic of some high
school studies.
As we have said, in our opinion, you have
much to look forward to. Daily, you will make
exciting discoveries about the guality and cali
ber of Stanford life.
Some discoveries will be of intangibles like
the friendliness inherent in the "Stanford
Spirit."
Others will be tangibles like the annual
Bookstore rebate.
All in all, it should be a great period in your
life.

Spirit."
Others will be tangibles like the annual
Bookstore rebate.
All in all, it should be a great period in your
life.
Frosh, we envy you.
You have four years, maybe more, of Stan
ford University, with its exciting life and study,
to look forward to, while some of us are wind
ing up our scholastic careers.
We would like to be in your shoes, we think,
aagerly pacing the Quad for the first time, see
ing the golden fagade of Memorial Church, the
expansive view from Hoover Tower, the won
drous green of Frost Memorial Amphitheater.
We would like to retrace some of our steps
at Stanford and start, in some cases, anew; for
the opportunities of learning—for tasting the
thoughts of a .thousand intellectual currents —
are many and varied, and looking back we real
ize that we have missed much.
For you, however, the way is clear. The fu
ture at Stanford lies open invitingly before you.
And included in that future are items that
will remain fixed always in mind.
Among them are the sometimes maddening,
but always exhilarating, debates about religion
and politics and economics that spring con
stantly from discussion in Western Civilization
classes; the discovery of old and new authors;
the challenge of Tuesday Evening Series.
What advantage you take of these and other
distinctive features of the University, of course,
is entirely up to you.
This you most likely understand. And, no
doubt, some of you, anxious to be on your own
at last, find this excitingly satisfying.
For, from here on out at Stanford, you will

be looked upon as mature, as being capable
of knowing and expressing your own mind.
It is a marvelous trust, one that Stanford ex
tends with unflinching faith, marking its atti
tude with such an expressive program as the
Honor Code.
As you most likely realize, there are few col
leges and almost no high schools in which you
can find such a genuine expression of trust. For
most of you it will be a new and, we dare say,
personally meaningful experience to take un
proctored examinations.
Stanford, in exchange for its trust, however,
expects much of you, representing, as you do,
the largest first-year class in the history of the
institution.
It expects, above all, high, clear, purposeful
thinking.
It expects also that you approach your stud
ies with tolerance and objectivity, not with the
narrow prejudice characteristic of some high
school studies.
As we have said, in our opinion, you have
much to look forward to. Daily, you will make
exciting discoveries about the guality and cali
ber of Stanford life.
Some discoveries will be of intangibles like
the friendliness inherent in the "Stanford
Spirit."
Others will be tangibles like the annual
Bookstore rebate.
All in all, it should be a great period in your
life.
