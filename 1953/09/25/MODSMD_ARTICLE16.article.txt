# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
FOR FROSH ONLY
Your records have been duly scrutinized, and you
have been born into the Stanford family. Welcome
to it.
By now you are as tired as a high school senior
on the morning after grad night of hearing welcom
ing speeches about the glories of the Farm. And

ko this is an appropriate time to
examine .some of the unfavorable
things said about Stanford. You
may have heard:
1. There is only one thing
worse than a cup of Cellar coffee
and that Is two cups of Cellar
coffee.
2. A Stanford woman is a two
face and both of them are ugly.
3. The Farm costs like hell.
4. Our language requirements

are medieval.
5. And that registration lines are so long that if
you want to buy an ice cream cone, you have to do
it through CARE.
Now, in defense of my alma, I must assert that
this is not altogether true. You don't have to buy
your ice cream cones through CARE at all.

A few suggestions:
1. Men, instead of signing up for ROTC, take the
course, Humanities 196 C (Methods and Principles of
Draft Evasion). Instructor is Pfc. Dick Contino.
2. At Stanford you have to stand in line for books,
tickets, registration, meals, games, and everything
else worth while and And so whenever
you see a line, get in it, and ask questions later.
3. Don't feel badly if you flunk the English A test.
Herbert Hoover flunked it twice, and look what
became of him.
# # *
Also, a word of advice. May it always be your
fortune to see your today at Stanford with the eyes
of tomorrow. In other words, don't consider the
Farm as a four-year prolongation of high school
social activities, but rather as a momentous stepping
stone to the future.
This doesn't mean bookwork and nothing else. It
means a comfortable mixture of work, social activ
ities, sports, and activities. By all means, do take
advantage of the abundance of activities that exist
here.
And so may you see your today at Stanford with
the eyes of tomorrow.
See ya on Quad.
