"Welcome, Class of 1957! In popular terminology you are freshmen,
but I hesitate to use the term because here on the Farm you, as much
as seniors, 'are full-edged members of the Stanford Family.
"There are privileges accessory to this equality, and there are respon
sibilities as well. The primary reason for your being here,'and for the
University's existence, is to provide you with knowledge and an approach
to life that will stand you in good stead always. We shall do our level best
to make the challenge a great and exciting one. Your answer to the
challenge to learn is your primary responsibility.
"The Class of 1957 is the largest first-year-class ever to enter Stanford,
but this does not dampen my eagerness to know every one of you person
ally during your years on the campus. Mrs. Sterling and I hope you will
take full advantage of the hospitality we can extend at our home, and
please remember that when I am in my office the door will always be
open to you.
"You will find your years at Stanford full but brief. Together, let's
make the most of them."
J. E. WALLACE STERLING

The students of Stanford take
great pride in welcoming you, the
class of '57. We are here to live with

you feel the significance of your
part at Stanfoi'd.

Spirit in the richness of your edu
cational experience and in the
memories of living in this, the Stan
ford Community.
