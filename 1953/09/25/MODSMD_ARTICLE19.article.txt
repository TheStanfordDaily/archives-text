# Auto Registration Set for Students
## 
### 
A special booth for registering
student automobiles will be set up
in the Pavilion by Alpha Phi Ome
ga, Police Chief Gordon Davis an
nounced yesterday.
All student-owned cars must be
registered with a special parking
sticker, Davis said. This sticker, the
rules for driving on campus, and a

map of student parking areas will
be distributed by A Phi O.
Besides the advantage to the po
lice of being able readily to identify
student - owned automobiles, the
stickers are also advantageous to
the drivers. Having a sticker means
that fines for traffic violations on
campus cost a dollar less.
