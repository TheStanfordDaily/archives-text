# Largest Freshman Class In History on Campus
## Class Ratio Is Lowest Ever As 1,250 Freshmen Invade Campus 
### 
The largest freshman class ever to enter Stanford arrived on
campus yesterday to begin the annual orientation program. Ori
entation activities for the new class, which includes a record
breaking number of new coeds, will continue through the week
_ fend.

Registrar Harvey Hall and Ad
missions Director Rixford K. Sny
der estimate that 1.250 frosh will
register Monday and Tuesday. This
figure includes 820 men and 430
women.
The total enrollment will ex
ceed last year's previous high by
50. The 430 new coeds represent
a larger feminine freshman influx
than the University has ever seen.
The ratio is 1.9 men to each wom
an as compared to 2.4 to 1 last
year.
Two-thirds of the entering fresh
men arc Californians, 800 of them
being from the state, while 450 are
from other states and foreign coun
tries.
Two hundred forty of the enter
ing men are prospective engineers,
according to data compiled from
entrance blanks. Ninety-five are
pre-meds, and 61 plan a pre-legal
curriculum, while the remainder
aim for humanities and sciences
majors.
Of the women, 40 or 50 plan to
seek a teaching credential in the
School of Education, and the rest
will be in departments of hu
manities and sciences.
Two innovations in freshman reg
istration procedure will be tried in
the new class. These, as announced
by Dr. Hall, arc as follows:
1. Language placement tests
will be given before registration
this year: Tests in Spanish,
French, and German will be given
this afternoon at 2 in Memorial
Auditorium, Cubberley Audito
rium, and Room 214, History Cor
ner, respectively.
2. There will be no section sign
ups for Western Civ; working on
the basis of students' application
blanks, the Registrar's office has as
signed Civ sections to all frosh who
would normally expect to take it
this year. Changes can be made at
the Civ signup area at the Pavilion.
Dr. Hall said that sophomores
planning to take Civ who have not
pre-registered for it must go to the
Pavilion signup area.
Dr. Hall emphasized that anyone
wishing to drop Civ should do so
at the Pavilion, to facilitate re
alignment of sections.
