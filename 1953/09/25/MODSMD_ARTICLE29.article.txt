Nearly 300 Stanford freshman
! men students received a red
: carpet welcome at Stanford Vil
| lage yesterday.
Enthusiastic and slightly awe
struck by the nearly 105-acre
' community within a community
] that is to be their home for the next
' academic year, the group, largest
j number of freshmen to he assigned
to Village dormitories, was shown
to its newly painted and renovated i
quarters.
Five dormitories Buildings 20t>.
208, 210, 2! 2, anil 214 have been
designated specifically lor occupancy
I by freshmen.
Once they met their new room
j mates, unpacked, artd relaxed mo
j mentai ily in their spacious rooms,
i the frosh met their respective resi- |
uent assistants, headed by Gene
1 Rypka, who will be ready *to help j
j them with any educational, perso- 1
nal, or vocational problems.
| They learned about the care- I
fully planned prog rain tlial has
been arranged for their pleasure
and entertainment during their
stay at the Village—an ambitious
activity - crammed program that
includes everything from intra
mural sports and recreational ac
tivities to campus activities as
well.
They heard:
That the entire freshman class
will be welcomed at a Jolly-up
Dance right in their own Village
auditorium tomorrow night at 8:15.
That the l'rosh Village residents
will have access to the Village's
own library, which has stepped up
its service to include a double sup
ply of books for Western Civiliza
tion classes.
That soap and towels will bt- pro
vided for the first time in Village
dormitory rest rooms.
The frosh also observed:
That the Village Council, coin
posed of presidents elected from
each of the l(i men's dormitories
j and two women's dormitories,
represents the Village in all stu
dent affairs, and that students
participate freely in campus ac
tivities as well.
That the student house organi/.a
ions govern each group and plan
social and athletic programs.
That freshmen living at the Vil
lage will mingle with upper divi-
I sion, graduate, and foreign students
who also live in Village dorms.
That residents of the Village may
use the facilities of the adjacent
1 Menlo Park recreation area includ
ing a swimming pool, tennis courts,
athletic field, and little theater.
Finally, the frosh had an oppor
tunity to tour the Village and
"discover" the places they've
heard about such as the post of
fice, barber shop, soda fountain,
laundry and dry-cleaning service,
self-service laundry, bowling al
ley, clubhouse, library, audito
rium, tenuis courts, and game
room.
A few inquisitive freshmen even
discovered that radar equipment
and model airplanes nested on Vil
lage dorm rooftops are used in con
nection with studies conducted by
the • Stanford Research Institute

which makes its home in the Vil
lage.
Lights in the five freshman dorms
burned late last night while the
slightly winded frosh talked and

compared notes about their first
day experiences on the Farm. Mos"
it appeared, agreed that their ne\
Village quarters were, indeed, a
ideal home away from home.
