# PUNTS AND PITCHES
## A 						Great Athletic History 
### Pete Grothe 
Attention, Mr. and Miss Class of '57: You may be abundantly certain
of one thing .... that you have entered a school that has one of the
most glorious athletic histories of them all.
Consider some of the athletes who have served four-year stretches ;it
the Farm: Hob Mathias is pegged by most experts as the best all-around
athlete in the world today. He won the most grueling of all athletic events,

xne uiympic uecatnion, at tne pmK-cneeKeu
age of 17; and at 21 he set the world and
Olympic record in the same event, despite the
fact that he had a painful muscle pull in his
left leg. Besides this, he made honorable
mention Ail-American in football. Tulare
Bob, now 22, is being mentioned in the same
hushed tones usually reserved for Babe Ruth,
Red Grange, and Jim Thorpe.
Then there was Hank Luisetti, the greatest
basketball player of them all. He led his
team to three successive PCC championships,
and shattered every hoop record in sight.
No one who saw him can ever forget Bill
McColl, the modest, two-time AU-Aiwerican

end. It ever mattered that two or three defenders always hawked him
He would throw his 225-pound frame into the skies and always putmaneu
ver his forest of defenders to catch the ball.
