# Albert Made 'T' Formation
## 
### 
Frankie Albert and the 1941 Rose Bowl team made football history.
The "T" formation was scoffed at when the Indians first broke out with
it with quarterback Albert at the helm. It's pretty difficult to go into any
stadium in the country now without seeing at least one of the teams
employing the "T."
The list continues endlessly . . . basketballers George Yardley, F.d
Tucker, .Vim Pollard, footballers Ernie Nevers (selected by a poll of sports
writers all over the country as the fourth greatest football player in the
last 50 years), Bobby Grayson, Norm Standlee, Bones Hamilton, Chuck
Taylor, trackmen Otis Chandler, Bud Held (who last year broke the
world's record in the javelin), world's record breaker Ben Eastman, Dink
Templeton, Gay Bryan, tennis star Ted Schroeder, golfer Lawson Little,
and twice Olympic diving champion Pete Desjardins.
And, parenthetically, Stanford had a football manager in 1892 who used
to run across the field with buckets of water. I doubt if he could throw
a football 20 yards, but he did okay for himself in another field of en
deavor. His name was Herbert Hoover.
Want more? Okay, witness the fact that in 1951,* Chuck Taylor was
named by the nation s sports scribes as "Coach of the Year," and that
Pop Warner, a former Stanford coach, was dubbed by the same group as
"Coach of All the Years."
