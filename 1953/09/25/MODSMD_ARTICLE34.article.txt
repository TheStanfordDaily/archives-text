Only last year, Stanford's baseball team won the Pacific Coast Con
ference, the swimmers placed fourth in the nation, the trackmen also
fourth, and the Indian golfers copped the national championship.
A few more notes of more than passing interest. Through 1952, Stan
ford football teams had decisioned their opponents 335 times while col
lecting only 135 losses. In the process, they scored 9,192 points to the op
position's 4,229. Stanford basketball teams have cuffed conference ene
mies 442 times while losing 305 tiffs. Throw in the additional statistic
that Card track and field men have set 17 world records and that eight
Stanfordites competed in the last Olympic games (more than any other
University in the world except USC, which had nine) and one is forced to
conclude that Stanford has made a considerable name for itself since guys
with handlebar mustaches first started throwing things and running back
in 1892.
And what makes this record doubly amazing is that LSJU has had
high entrance requirements for athletes and has never offered any "deals,"
such as those made at USC.
Make no mistake about it. You may feel smugly proud of Stanford's
athletic history.
