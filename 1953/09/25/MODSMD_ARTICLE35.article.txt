# 'Overrated' Indian Eleven Loses Opener to COP
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
On the bulletin board of the
Stanford football team, a cartoon
appeared this week. It showed a
prizefighter who had just suf
fered a horrible beating being
carried out by two trainers. He
was saying to them, "Boy, was /
overrated!"
This seemed to be the general im
i prcssion conveyed by the Cards in
! their first outing ;jg;iinst COP. Af
j ter a strong start, they quickly
I faded, losing by a score of 25-20.
After viewing films of the game.
Coach Chuck Taylor's only com
ment was "We were terrfble." The
! only player he would acknowledge
as having done a good job was re
! serve halfback Ernie Dorn.
The Cards looked for the first
i ten minutes of p!a\ like (lie Hose
j [Jowl team of two seasons a,?o.
' Winning the toss, Stanford cap
tain Norm Manongian chose to
kick oft". It was a wise decision,
for two plays later the visiting
| Tigers fumbled on their own 33.
On the first play of the season for
ttie Cards halfback Ron Cook cut
through left tackle for 21 yards.
Four plays later the Indians scored,
i Cook crossing the goal.
The hosts handed the Tigers their
first tally. Quarterback Bob Gar
rett fumbled on the 16. Five more
plays, a missed conversion, and the
score stood 7-(5.
The Cards increased their lead
with a drive covering from their
own 37. Hill Wentworth scored
i the TD on a two-yard plunge.

Garrett missed the conversion,
and Stanford held a comfortable
13-6 lead.
The new substitution rule helped
the visitors score their next tally.
With just two minutes to go in the
half, the four-minute rule was in
effect. Second-stringers had played
a good part of the second quarter,
so COP Coach Jack "Moose" Myers
put in his fresh regulars.
Art Leibscher, who played an
outstanding game for the Tigers,
scored their second tally following
a 75-yard drive. Again the point
after-touchdown was missed, and
the Cards held a 13-12 half-time
lead.
COP was never headed after the
third period, when they scored
their third tally. Quarterback
Skip Ottoson passed to Willie
Kichardson, who scampered into
the end zone. A final score was
made when pass interference was

ruled on Don Kafka on the Stan
ford .'{4. A deceptive pass play
from Ottosun to Leihscher soon
put the visitors on the four. A
quartet I;: ck sucak by Otto on
made it 25
At thi point Stanford trii-d .i fu
tile attempt to come back in the
yanit . After two un. uceei-.sful at
teinpts t.) !iom the Stanford
lour, a pass to Tennefoss brought
the vcortf t<j 25-2U, and there it
stayed.
