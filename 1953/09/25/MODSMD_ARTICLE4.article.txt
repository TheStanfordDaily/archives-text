Stanford's 1953 football ma
chine, upset last week by Col
lege of Pacific 25 to 20, will host
a strong University of Oregon
team tomorrow in the Stadium
at 2 p.m.
The Indians, who disappointed
10,000 sun - lovers in the Stadium
Saturday by their sloppy, unin
spired play, must improve about 100
per cent if they are to avoid an 0
and 2 won-lost record after two
weeks of play.
Coach Chuck Taylor was able to
cite only two players, guard Phil
Wilson and tackle Barry Smith, for
outstanding play after the COP
game.
Taylor has indicated that lie
may start sophomore Don Kafka
at quarterback.
As for Saturday's opposition, Ore
gon warmed up last week with a
20 to 12 win over Nebraska, always
a strong member of the Midwest
ern Big 7 Conference.
The Cards can attribute most
of their mistakes against Pacific
to first - game jitters and the
change-over from platoon-system
football, which forced heretofore
offensive stalwarts to play defen
sive ball. Taylor has been work-
ing the team all week <111 block
ing and tackling and has stated
that he expects the Cards to show
a lot more of their potential to
morrow.
The opener hist week was not j
without its bright spots, however,
as soph halfback Ernie Dorn showed :
enough running ability to move up J
to a starting role tomorrow, and re- ;
serve ends Marv Tennefoss and
John Stewart proved that Stanford
has lour strong flankmen.
Manoogian, regarded as an All-
American guard prospect, suffered

I with upset stomach for three days
j before Saturday's game, and was
removed in the third quarter and
treated for heat prostration.
