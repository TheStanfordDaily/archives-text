It was a big day—yes, a very big day, indeed—for freshman
Bob Still yesterday.
Like some other 1,250 of his fellow classmates who had been
anxiously awaiting and dreaming of their first day on the Farm,
Bob arrived on the campus early in the morning with his parents
tabegin a whirlwind round-the-clock orientation program mapped
out by the pre-registration committee.
Bob's first concern was getting into his room in Encina. He
checked in at Encina Director Ellene Sumner's office, picked up
his room key and towels, and headed for his room in the basement
of Encina.
A six-foot six-inch former student body president from Olympia,
Wash., Bob wanted to make sure he'd get a bed that would ac
commodate him comfortably.
"I see they have got new beds this year," he sighed with a note
of relief. "I was told that you should have seen the old ones."
Bob and his parents looked about the room. Bob's mother
seemed pleased with his room assignment, particularly the regu
lar closet and wardrobe facilities.
"See," she observed, "there's plenty of room for Bob to hang
up his trousers."
The only trace of Bob's roommates so far was a note. "Pick a
bed—Roy Dils," it said.
(Bob eventually met Dils, who lives in Palo Alto, and his other
roommate, Dick Wasteney, who hails from Mexico City.)
Next came the chore of unpacking the family automobile. Bob
managed to carry a trunk, typewriter, and three suitcases to his
room in one trip, thanks to the help of pre-registration committee
members and his father.
And when the moving-in chore had been completed and the
Still family had a chance to catch their breath and talk to Bob alone
for a few moments. Bob bade them farewell.
Next, Bob checked his orientation program, glanced at his
watch, met his roommates and neighbors, and was off to lunch.
The food? "Well, it's a good start," Bob smiled. "I'm quite an
eater, you know, and the food really 'showed me' at first."
After lunch Bob was anxious to join a tour of the campus which
he saw yesterday for the first time.
"I love everything about Stanford," he said. "Hoover Tower,
the Frost Amphitheater ... I just can't put it into words. Every
thing was inspiring . . . this is a pleasant environment."
After the tour, Bob, his friends, and fellow classmates of the
Class of '57 assembled in Frost Amphitheater for welcome ad
dresses by University dignitaries.
"I was really impressed with the two presidents (ASSU Pres
ident Don Lozabnick and University President J. E. Wallace Ster
ling)," Bob said.
"Their speeches had a lot o«f humor in them and they seemed
to hit me just in the right place and at the right time. I liked Presi
dent Sterling's closing statement, the part where he said, 'How
ever beautifully a nightingale may sing, it has never been known
to win a prize in a poultry show.' That was a touching note,"
Bob added, "and it really give 6 you something to think about."
Dinner, house meetings with sponsors and meeting more friends
rounded out Bob's busy first day.
