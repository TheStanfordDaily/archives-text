# Garrett Bootlegs for TD
## 
### 

OPPOSITION FOOLED-- Bob Garrett, Stanford quarterback,
takes a handoff to his right, runs to his left, and scores the only
tally of the game against Oregon. Here he nears the goal lino,
eluding a would-be tackier. A few moments later he converted
to scor all the points of the 7-0 game. For details, sec Irwin
Johnson's story on page 3, and the locker room comments on
page 6. â€”Daily photo by Roy Broun
