### 
Tables were turned it Stanford yesterday when the 63-year-old
father of a faculty member registered as an undergraduate stu
dent.
Thomas A. Ryan is continuing studies he began in 1951 fol
lowing his retirement after 40 years with the U.S. Postal Transpor
tation Service.

He transferred to Stanford from*
thr College of St. Thomas in St Paul,
Minnesota, his former home. He and
Mrs. Ryan have bought a home at
474 Todd street, Mountain View.
A history major, Ryan will not
have any classes this fall with his
son, Lawrence V. Ryan, an instruc- j
tor in the Department of English. I
"I would like to have him in a
class sometime before he gradu- !
ates," says the son. "He's a good
student. ! know because â€¢ was his 1
faculty adviser his freshman year
;it St. Thomas." The younger Ryan
was an English instructor there i
before coining to Stanford two
years ago.
Thomas Ryan plans to complete j
work required for his A.B. in an- j
other year and a half. He is minor
ing in philosophy and religion. Two i
subjects he will study this fall, \
United States history and the his
tory of the Latin American Colonial
period, tie in with his plans for a j
post-career hareer.
He intends to become an explorer !
and historian of old Spanish mis
sions in the Southwest. His first in
terest in this field resulted from his
chance finding of an old abandoned
mission in the Jemez Mountains in
New Mexico.
"When I couldn't, find out anything j
about its history," Ryan says,"I de
cided something should be done, be
fore many missions pass into obliv
ion."
Ryan finds student life enjoyable.
"! was married right after I fin
ished high school," he says,"and
that was before the day of married
men in college. After putting my
children through college, 1 thought
it was my turn."
Ryan had served as a major in the
Army in World War II in the Alas
kan-Aleutian area and is going to
college just like any other veteran
on the GI bill.
He decided to transfer to Stanford
after visiting here with his son Law
rcnec and his wife, Patricia.
