# Time for Re-evaluation
## 
### 
Thursday, as members of the largest fresh
man class in the history of Stanford University
streamed into their dormitories, The Daily
asked many of thorn what they hoped to gain
during their four years here.
We wondered, however, as we talked with
the frosh, their eyes alight with excitement and
interest, what answers upperclassmen would
give to a similar guestion.
We know, when we put the guestion to our
selves, it was difficult to give a definite answer.
Like many upperclass students, we feel, in
our progress through the University, that we
have lost sight of some of the marvelously ex
citing and inviting opportunities offered—the
many lectures, the Revival Series, the debates,
the conferences.
ft would seem that too many upperclass stu
dents have overlooked these and the many
other activities available and have become too
bogged in the routine of their major subject or
the limited circle of their favorite extra-curricu
lar activities.
They no longer see the campus, it would
seem, with the freshman's eye for new adven

ture and challenging experience.
Now, with a fresh school term ahead, this
would seem an ideal time to re-evaluate our
collegiate goals, to ask ourselves what we hope
to gain from Stanford.
Such a guestion, if honestly and thoughtfully
answered, would, perhaps, open our eyes to
the wide rangS of campus activity and stir us
from the lethargy—called variously the sopho
more slump, the junior drag, the senior stag
ger—that so often sweeps over students after
their freshman year.
With a new round of activity being planned
by the various campus organizations and de
partments, it would be wqll that all of us ac
guaint ourselves with their programs, with an
eye to find:
1) Where we might personally participate
and broaden our interests and outlook.
2) How we can better integrate the programs
and study in which we are interested into the
over-all scheme of campus endeavor.
This we should do, it would seem, if we are
to take full and complete advantage of Stanford,
its academics, its traditions, its social life.
