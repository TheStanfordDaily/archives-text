# BULL SESSION
## 
### DICK MANSFIELD 
Again, the Daily has sent out its hoarse cry for
volunteers for the new volume. Uncle Hadley needs
men! And women! Absolutely no experience is re
quired—just interest, to the extent of three hours'
labor on the do: k each wuek. Last year an orang
aitan ma do his way into the Daily shack and started
tearing the wire machine apart. That orang-utan,

inarne of Floyd, whs really eager!
Floyd was the only member of
the Daily stuff lust year who
hadn't been editor of his high
su hool newspaper, but they start
ed him out typing up "Once
Around the Quad" and phoning
the Palo Alto Hospital for "Un
der the Weather," and by the '
end of the year Floyd was wait
ing Bull Sessions.
It just goes to show.

Here are some of the positions you may fill if you
join the Daily:
REPORTER: A Daily reporter is a campus wheel.
He is the one who lurks with pencil poised outside
the Main Library conference room. He's got to be
fast and shifty deft to his left—and ready to collar
anyone for a quote. He must speak and write Eng
lish. know how to answer the Daily telephone ("Hel
lo? No!"), and have at least one friend among the
photographers to take pictures of committee chair

men for him. Incidentally, he must know where the
Information Office is and the Isolation Hospital's
telephone number.
PHOTOGRAPHER: Here is the man who has
found that it is easier to sleep in a darkroom than
on the copy desk. Drinking hypo has given him a
strong stomach for accident pctures. He must be
used to being summoned at midnight to go take a
picture of a speeding fire engine while Roff holds the
presses. Since the average photographer is barely
literate, he should have at least one friend among
the reporters to write cutlines for his pictures.
AD SALESMAN: The Daily ad salesman knows
every merchant in town, and what he's worth in
column inches. Selling the Laundromat half the
back page for a week is no mean feat, but even worse
is getting all the local movie houses to keep their
ads up to date. For selling ads. the worker receives
a modest sum, which covers his carfare to and from
University Avenue. It's wonderful experience.
BULL SESSIONER: The height of ambition. Ev
eryone wants to be a Bull Sessioner, or thinks he
is one. Since the average Bull Sessioner is barely
literate, he should have at least one friend.
Quite seriously, experience isn't really important
to success on the Daily. Surprisingly enough, it is
quite true that you can get ahead on the Daily just
as rapidly as you wish, dependent on the interest
shown. Give it a look; come over to the tryout meet
ing! You'll get your laughs, if nothing else.

presses. Since the average photographer is barely
literate, he should have at least one friend among
the reporters to write cutlines for his pictures.
AD SALESMAN: The Daily ad salesman knows
every merchant in town, and what he's worth in
column inches. Selling the Laundromat half the
back page for a week is no mean feat, but even worse
is getting all the local movie houses to keep their
ads up to date. For selling ads. the worker receives
a modest sum, which covers his carfare to and from
University Avenue. It's wonderful experience.
BULL SESSIONER: The height of ambition. Ev
eryone wants to be a Bull Sessioner, or thinks he
is one. Since the average Bull Sessioner is barely
literate, he should have at least one friend.
Quite seriously, experience isn't really important
to success on the Daily. Surprisingly enough, it is
quite true that you can get ahead on the Daily just
as rapidly as you wish, dependent on the interest
shown. Give it a look; come over to the tryout meet
ing! You'll get your laughs, if nothing else.

Again, the Daily has sent out its hoarse cry for
volunteers for the new volume. Uncle Hadley needs
men! And women! Absolutely no experience is re
quired—just interest, to the extent of three hours'
labor on the do: k each wuek. Last year an orang
aitan ma do his way into the Daily shack and started
tearing the wire machine apart. That orang-utan,

inarne of Floyd, whs really eager!
Floyd was the only member of
the Daily stuff lust year who
hadn't been editor of his high
su hool newspaper, but they start
ed him out typing up "Once
Around the Quad" and phoning
the Palo Alto Hospital for "Un
der the Weather," and by the '
end of the year Floyd was wait
ing Bull Sessions.
It just goes to show.

Here are some of the positions you may fill if you
join the Daily:
REPORTER: A Daily reporter is a campus wheel.
He is the one who lurks with pencil poised outside
the Main Library conference room. He's got to be
fast and shifty deft to his left—and ready to collar
anyone for a quote. He must speak and write Eng
lish. know how to answer the Daily telephone ("Hel
lo? No!"), and have at least one friend among the
photographers to take pictures of committee chair

men for him. Incidentally, he must know where the
Information Office is and the Isolation Hospital's
telephone number.
PHOTOGRAPHER: Here is the man who has
found that it is easier to sleep in a darkroom than
on the copy desk. Drinking hypo has given him a
strong stomach for accident pctures. He must be
used to being summoned at midnight to go take a
picture of a speeding fire engine while Roff holds the
presses. Since the average photographer is barely
literate, he should have at least one friend among
the reporters to write cutlines for his pictures.
AD SALESMAN: The Daily ad salesman knows
every merchant in town, and what he's worth in
column inches. Selling the Laundromat half the
