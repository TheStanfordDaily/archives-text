# New Discoveries About Atom Are Made With Stanford's Electron Microscope
## 
### 
An apparatus that peers 10
times deeper into the atom than
ever before enough to distin
guish particles within the nu
cleus only two one-hundredths
of a trillionth of an inch apart —
has been perfected by Stanford
physicists.
The device—the most powerful
microscope equipment ever built—
is ;i combination of the world's most
powerful electron linear accelerator
with u high-eneugy electron scatter
ing apparatus.
The accelerator "shoots" electrons
which penetrate the nucleus of the
atom, and the scattering apparatus
measures their number and the an
gles at which they are deflected.
This combination has told the
Stanford scientists astounding facts
about the composition of the nu
cleus, for example:
(1) (hat it is not a solid little
ball of uniformly-packed particles,
ms widely believed, but more of a
"cottony" sphere composed of par
ticles;
(2) that these particles are so
densely crowded at the corcv that
it appears solid, but they gradually
(bin out almost into nothingness
toward the limits of the sphere; and
(:i) that although the average
density is about what was previ
ously predicted, the core is Ave to
"*!< r n*TTrhes denser. It is about l.'JO
trillion times denser than water. i\
mere drop of water of such densi
ty would weigh about two million
twns.
Credit for these discoveries be
lt* ays to i Stanford rasearch group
directed by Robort Hofstadter, Stan
ford nuclei# physicist who designed
■catering equipment.

Associated with Dr. Hofstadter
were Harry R. Fechter, a graduate
student, and John A. Mclntyre of
Stanford's W. W. Hansen Labora
tories, where the experiments were j
carried out. Eva Wiener, a graduate
student who recently lost her life in
an auto accident, was an assistant
in the project.
Hofstadter presented a report of
their work last April at a meeting
of the American Physical Society in
Washington, D.C. A few weeks later, j
results of related experiments con
ducted independently were an
nounced by a Columbia University
scientist. The original Hofstadter
report is published in the current
issue of the Society's official journal,
The Physical Review.
The Stanford discoveries reveal
such basic chaages in the concept
of matter that Hofstadter was re
luctant to estimate their signifi
cance.
"We now find considerable space
between particles in the nucleus
where we once thought a uniform
ly dense solid existed," he said.
"That suggests it may be possible
to compress it.
"But this is pure speculation," he
added hastily. "We will first have
to develop new hypotheses to ex
plain these new phenomena. Such
explanations may reveal utterly un
suspected new paths for investiga
tion. It is clearly impossible to guess
what discoveries may result."
The "eye-piece" of Hofstadter'?
high-energy electron scattering ap
paratus is a two-and-a-half-ton
magnet. With counters and photo
multipliers attached, it analyzes the
angles of deflection and numbers of
the electrons shot by the accelerator
through nuclei of the target mater
ial. The data obtained enable the
physicists—after complicated mathe

matical calculations—to construct an
entirely new picture of the atomic
nucleus.
Target materials so far have been
gold. lead, and tantalum — heavy
i metals with very dense nuclei—and
the light metal, beryllium. They are
j used in the form of metal foils as
thin as one-thousandth of an inch.
This is about 100,000 atoms in
thickness, however. And the nucleus
is estimated to be less than one-trill
| ionth of the volume of its atom.
Exploring the inside of this in
finitesimal target, the nucleus, he
comes possible with the high
energy electrons developed by the
linear accelerator. The particles
fired by most other atom-smashers
are protons and neutrons — the
same particles as those in the nu
cleus. The bombardment by like
particles sets up "mesonic" forces
which make analysis hopelessly
complicated.
The electrons do not actually
| strike the particles of the nucleus,
! but pass freely through them and are
| deflected by the particles' electrical
fields. Electrons give so much infor
mation only at high energies like the
125 to 150 million volts used by Hof
stadter.
And while his present apparatus
; can see 10 times deeper into the nu
cleus than anything ever built pre
viously, Hofstadter is already con
structing equipment which will use
a 25-ton magnet and will have triple
the strength of the device he is now
using. This new apparatus, he said,
will accomodate 500 - million - volt
electrons whose wavelengths will be
one-sixth of the average diameter of
i the gold nucleus.

The "eye-piece" of Hofstadter'?
high-energy electron scattering ap
paratus is a two-and-a-half-ton
magnet. With counters and photo
multipliers attached, it analyzes the
angles of deflection and numbers of
the electrons shot by the accelerator
through nuclei of the target mater
ial. The data obtained enable the
physicists—after complicated mathe

matical calculations—to construct an
entirely new picture of the atomic
nucleus.
Target materials so far have been
gold. lead, and tantalum — heavy
i metals with very dense nuclei—and
the light metal, beryllium. They are
j used in the form of metal foils as
thin as one-thousandth of an inch.
This is about 100,000 atoms in
thickness, however. And the nucleus
is estimated to be less than one-trill
| ionth of the volume of its atom.
Exploring the inside of this in
finitesimal target, the nucleus, he
comes possible with the high
energy electrons developed by the
linear accelerator. The particles
fired by most other atom-smashers
are protons and neutrons — the
same particles as those in the nu
cleus. The bombardment by like
particles sets up "mesonic" forces
which make analysis hopelessly
complicated.
The electrons do not actually
| strike the particles of the nucleus,
! but pass freely through them and are
| deflected by the particles' electrical
fields. Electrons give so much infor
mation only at high energies like the
125 to 150 million volts used by Hof
stadter.
And while his present apparatus
; can see 10 times deeper into the nu
cleus than anything ever built pre
viously, Hofstadter is already con
structing equipment which will use
a 25-ton magnet and will have triple
the strength of the device he is now
using. This new apparatus, he said,
will accomodate 500 - million - volt
electrons whose wavelengths will be
one-sixth of the average diameter of
i the gold nucleus.
An apparatus that peers 10
times deeper into the atom than
ever before enough to distin
guish particles within the nu

has been perfected by Stanford
physicists.
The device—the most powerful
microscope equipment ever built—
is ;i combination of the world's most
powerful electron linear accelerator
with u high-eneugy electron scatter
ing apparatus.
The accelerator "shoots" electrons
which penetrate the nucleus of the
atom, and the scattering apparatus
measures their number and the an
gles at which they are deflected.
This combination has told the
Stanford scientists astounding facts
about the composition of the nu
cleus, for example:
(1) (hat it is not a solid little
ball of uniformly-packed particles,
ms widely believed, but more of a
"cottony" sphere composed of par
ticles;
(2) that these particles are so
densely crowded at the corcv that
it appears solid, but they gradually
(bin out almost into nothingness
toward the limits of the sphere; and
(:i) that although the average
density is about what was previ
