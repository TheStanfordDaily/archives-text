GRAD ORIENTATION GETS UNDERWAY—Dean H. Donald
Winbigler explained the American University system to a
group of foreign grad students in the Village Auditorium Friday
at 3 p.m. as a part of the Graduate Orientation program. This
program, new to Stanford this year, assisted over 300 graduate
students in becoming oriented with Stanford. Student response
to this program was such that Dean Winbigler declared that it
would be continued in future years.
