# Stanford's Footballers Squeak By Oregon, 7-0
## Garrett's Bootleg Wins Dull Game 
### IRWIN JOHNSON 
Striking for the game's only
touchdown in the first six min
utes, Chuck Taylor's footballers
won their Pacific Coast Confer
ence opener Saturday, beating
the University of Oregon Ducks
7 to 0 before 14,500 bored spec
tators ki the Stadium.
The Indians took the opening
kickoff and drove 61 yards to the
Oregon four the running oi Ron
Cook, Bill Rogers, and Jarvis Wat
son, where quarterback Bobby Gar
rett pulled the sweetest play of the
day. F-acing a nine-man line, Gar
rett faked to Watson, who plowed
through the middle, then bootlegged
wide around his own left end.
Duck safety man George Shaw
tripped him up on the one - yard
line, but Bobby fell into the end
zone for six points that looked big
ger and bigger as the game pro
gressed.
Garrett converted to make it 7
to 0, and the game resolved itself
into a punting duel until late in
the second quarter.
With Dick James and Parrel I
Allnight running the Stanford
ends, and with the aid of a rough
ness penalty on the Cards, Oregon
drove to the Indian 10-yard line.
James, an outstanding sophomore,
started wide around his own right
end, eluded two tacklers, and ran
smack into guard Len Doster.
Doster, who played a fine game
as Norm Manoogian's substitute,
jolted the hall loose from James'
grasp and Jerry Goldberg picked
it up to end that threat.
After the Ducks heard a few
words from their coach, Len Casa
nova, at half-time, they took the
second-half kickoff and looked very
good as they drove from their own
21 to the Indian five, where they
had four downs to' push it across.
This was the occasion for one of
Stanford's brightest moments, as
the Redshirts showed some real
good defensive play. Garrett, who
made the fans forget his part in the
COP debacle with his work this
Saturday, stopped Albright after a
yard gain and fullback Watson halt
ed James on the one.
With third and one for a touch
down, James headed wide to his
right where the uneasy Stanford
rooters got a glimpse of Marv
Tennefoss 'standing alone while
James and two blockers roared
toward him. Then the crowd
went wild as Tennefoss slipped by
both blockers and dumped James
back to the four.
Quarterback Shaw as a fourth
down resort then tossed a looping
pass to the NCAA high-jumping co
champion, (J-foot 5-inch end Emery
Barnes. Barnes, very good on of
fense but the worst defensive play
er we've ever seen, got a hand on
the ball, but so did Tennefoss, de
fending on the play, and the ball
fell to the ground for an incom
plete pass.
The rest of the game provided
little excitement as the Stanfords
were running well in their own ter
ritory but were slowed up once they
passed midfield.
As for Oregon, George Shaw
suffered a concussion in the first
quarter and its effects were seen
in the fourth period. The Ducks
rolled down to the Card 2(1. with
the Webfoot halfbacks running
wild around both ends. Then
Shaw, whose brother Tom quar
terbacked the Stanford team a
few years ago, tied up and ran
four straight plays into the middle
of the line. This was real folly,
as Phil Wilson, Goldberg, and
Doster, who were tough all day
long, stopped the Ducks with sev-
en yards gained on four plays.
A mystery to the 14,500 onlookers
was the fact that the usually pass
happy Indians tried only three aer
ials during the game. Coach Taylor
explained the situation by saying
that Oregon used a wide five-man
line with six men back to stop the
passing game, which made it easy
to gain by running with the ball.
Taylor, as were most of the fans,
was much impressed with the run
ning of Ernie Dorn, the sophomore

from Minnesota, who runs much
like John Strzykalski, an All-League
halfback for the San Francisco
Forty-Niners.
The Indians play their next two
games away from home, starting
with Illinois next Saturday at
Champaign.

COP debacle with his work this
Saturday, stopped Albright after a
yard gain and fullback Watson halt
ed James on the one.
With third and one for a touch
down, James headed wide to his
right where the uneasy Stanford
rooters got a glimpse of Marv
Tennefoss 'standing alone while
James and two blockers roared
toward him. Then the crowd
went wild as Tennefoss slipped by
both blockers and dumped James
back to the four.
Quarterback Shaw as a fourth
down resort then tossed a looping
pass to the NCAA high-jumping co
champion, (J-foot 5-inch end Emery
Barnes. Barnes, very good on of
fense but the worst defensive play
er we've ever seen, got a hand on
the ball, but so did Tennefoss, de
fending on the play, and the ball
fell to the ground for an incom
plete pass.
The rest of the game provided
little excitement as the Stanfords
were running well in their own ter
ritory but were slowed up once they
passed midfield.
As for Oregon, George Shaw
suffered a concussion in the first
quarter and its effects were seen
in the fourth period. The Ducks
rolled down to the Card 2(1. with
the Webfoot halfbacks running
wild around both ends. Then
Shaw, whose brother Tom quar
terbacked the Stanford team a
few years ago, tied up and ran
four straight plays into the middle
of the line. This was real folly,
as Phil Wilson, Goldberg, and
Doster, who were tough all day
long, stopped the Ducks with sev-
en yards gained on four plays.
A mystery to the 14,500 onlookers
was the fact that the usually pass
happy Indians tried only three aer
ials during the game. Coach Taylor
explained the situation by saying
that Oregon used a wide five-man
line with six men back to stop the
passing game, which made it easy
to gain by running with the ball.
Taylor, as were most of the fans,
was much impressed with the run
ning of Ernie Dorn, the sophomore

from Minnesota, who runs much
like John Strzykalski, an All-League
halfback for the San Francisco
Forty-Niners.
The Indians play their next two
games away from home, starting
with Illinois next Saturday at
Champaign.
Striking for the game's only
touchdown in the first six min
utes, Chuck Taylor's footballers
won their Pacific Coast Confer
ence opener Saturday, beating
the University of Oregon Ducks
7 to 0 before 14,500 bored spec
tators ki the Stadium.
The Indians took the opening
kickoff and drove 61 yards to the
Oregon four the running oi Ron
Cook, Bill Rogers, and Jarvis Wat
son, where quarterback Bobby Gar
rett pulled the sweetest play of the
day. F-acing a nine-man line, Gar
rett faked to Watson, who plowed
through the middle, then bootlegged
wide around his own left end.
Duck safety man George Shaw
tripped him up on the one - yard
line, but Bobby fell into the end
zone for six points that looked big
ger and bigger as the game pro
gressed.
Garrett converted to make it 7
to 0, and the game resolved itself
into a punting duel until late in
the second quarter.
With Dick James and Parrel I
Allnight running the Stanford
ends, and with the aid of a rough
ness penalty on the Cards, Oregon
drove to the Indian 10-yard line.
James, an outstanding sophomore,
started wide around his own right
end, eluded two tacklers, and ran
smack into guard Len Doster.
Doster, who played a fine game
as Norm Manoogian's substitute,
jolted the hall loose from James'
grasp and Jerry Goldberg picked
it up to end that threat.
After the Ducks heard a few
words from their coach, Len Casa
nova, at half-time, they took the
second-half kickoff and looked very
good as they drove from their own
21 to the Indian five, where they
had four downs to' push it across.
This was the occasion for one of
Stanford's brightest moments, as
the Redshirts showed some real
good defensive play. Garrett, who
made the fans forget his part in the
COP debacle with his work this
Saturday, stopped Albright after a
yard gain and fullback Watson halt
ed James on the one.
With third and one for a touch

right where the uneasy Stanford
