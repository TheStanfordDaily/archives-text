# Diploma Buried in Foxhole Is Replaced
## 
### 
A lot of "spade work" goes into
getting any college diploma. How
ever, for Lt. Charles M. Hunter,
Stanford alumnus of the Class of
15)50, the actual, not figurative,
spade work would be prohibitive.
Hunter received his diploma in
August, 1950, in a foxhole near the
Naktong River on the Korean bat
tlefront. It had been forwarded by
the Army when the University
mailed it to him after graduation
exercises in June. The Sacramento
officer had completed his history
course in January.
When the First Cavalry Divi
sion regiment platoon he com

manded moved on, Hunter found
limit t<» what he could carry. He
buried the leather-hound diploma
at the bottom of the foxhole.
Six months later, returning along
the Naktong River, he located the
spot where he had left the docu
ment. His sheepskin was consider
ably deeper in the earVh than the
two - foot level at which he had
cached it. In the intervening months
the local farmers had filled in all
the foxholes and crops were grow
ing in the former battlefield.
Harvey Hall. Stanford registrar,
found the solution to the lieuten

ant's dilemma. He turned up a
dupli rate diploma of the proper
year in his office and mailed it to
Hunter.
Now a first lieutenant with an ar
tillery. division attached to the
headquarters of the Coiftmanding
General, U.S. Army Caribbean
Command, Hunter is stationed at
Fort Amador, Canal Zone.
His commanding officer, Maj. Gen.
Lester J. Whitlock, U.S.A., will pre
sent the diploma to him in a formal
ceremony. And Hunter won't hide
it in the Panama Canal the next
time he moves.
