# 'Quiet' Summer Features Large Enrollment, Administrative Changes, Full Social Program
## 
### HADLEY ROFF Editor, The Daily 
Things might look quiet and
riull on tho Stanford campus
during suninx i, but don't let
appearances fool you.
There might be lower cars
and some of the bigger dorms
might be closed, but I his in no
way indicates a curtailment of
activities.
This summer, particularly, was

a Inisy one, socially and adminis
tratively, for both faculty mem
bers and students.
In fact, some students wlio have
attended summer sessions in ilie
past said this year's was by far the
isnost active.
The quarter got under way June
24, 11) days after 2,270 seniors and
graduate students paraded into
Frost Memorial Amphitheater in
the sixty - second Commencement
exercise.
And it pot. off to a fast start: 2,173
students registered, most of them

for graduate study, making for one
of the largest summer enrollments
in the University's history.
The summer social calendar
was ollicially inaugurated on June
»I a( a reception in the spacious
v inner square of Lagunita Court.
The event, which was aimed at
new students, was sponsored by
the Associated Students of Stan
ford University. Five hundred
students attended.
The reception was followed up by
another welcoming event, a water
melon feed and swimming party at
the Women's Pool on June 28.
Arranging these and other activi
ties were the three top ASSU offi
cers. for the summer, Student Body
President Fran Kirk, Vice - Presi
dent Lucie Welles, and Student
Manager Jim Banks.
Heading the University admin
istration for the summer was Pro
vost Douglas Whitaker who pre
sided in the absence of President
J. E. Wallace Sterling. Dr. Ster
ling left early in the summer for a
three months' tour of Europe. He
arrived back on campus and re
sumed bis duties late last week.
In a permanent administrative
change, it was announced early in
the summer that I. James Quillen,
professor of education, would suc
ceed Dean A. John llartky as head
of the School of Education. Dr.
Bartky submitted his resignation
late in' May, giving as his reason a
desire to spend more time writing.
He will continue as professor of ed
ucation. (For details of this shift,
see elsewhere on this page.)
The summer Executive Commit
tee, acting on a suggestion by Kirk,
voted on July 8 to sponsor open
discussions on academic freedom,
long a topic of agitated debate on
this and other campuses.
The first academic freedom dis
cussion, held July 14, attracted

about 50 students. Many views were
represented, and the discussions
were continued on a weekly basis
through the quarter. Kirk presided
at the meetings, which drew stu
dents from almost every depart
ment.
The group topped off their sum
mer activity with a debate on
whether legislative eom m i 1.1. ee s
should investigate Communist influ
ences in colleges, winch was held
before an almost capacity audience
in Cubberley Auditorium Aug. 7.
The ASSU invited an ex-cavalry
colonel, Wheaton Brewer, currently
an advertising executive for Cali
fornia Farmer's Magazine, and John
H. Edwards, a University of Califor
nia English instructor, and Monrad
Paulson, of the law school here, to
debate the issue. Brewer held that
committees have the right and the
duty to probe suspected subversion
in colleges. The other two main
tained, however, that current com
mittee practices made such inqui
ries decidedly harmful.
Another big ASSU project this
summer was the sponsorship of
an outdoor concert, the first ever
to be held here. The concert, an
all-Mozart presentation, was held
July 17 on the expansive lawns of
the Knoll and attracted 1,000 mu
sic lovers from campus and near
by communities.
Natalie Bodanya, Metropolitan
Opera soprano, and Richard Cum
ming, pianist, were soloists, and
Professor Sandor Salgo of the Music
Department led the 30-piece en
semble. Profits from the concert
went into a summer scholarship
fund for women.
A benefit program of internation
al scope went into effect this sum
mer when the University initiated
a scheme to aid in the rehabilita
tion of the University of .the Phil
ippines in Manila. The project,

which was announced July 10 by
Provost Whitaker, will lie financed
by the U.S. Mutual Security Agency
and provides that Stanford send an
nually eight faculty specialists to
the war-wrecked institution. Paul
H. Hanna of the School of Educa
tion will act as co-ordinator of the
program.
In announcing the University's
action, Provost Whitaker said, "Our
first hope is that our efforts may
eventually bring to all these people
a full share of peaceful prosperity
and contentment. But our most rev
erent wish is that it may give rise
to a lasting new era of mutual un
derstanding, sympathy, and co-op
eration between Asia and America."
On July Hi came the startling
word that the Board of Trustees,
meeting in San Francisco, had de
cided to move the Stanford Medical
School from its long-time home in
San Francisco to quarters which
will be constructed on campus.
Lloyd Dinkelspicl, president of the
board, in telling of the decision, said
such a shift most likely would take
from three to five years. (For f'ur
. ther details see elsewhere on this
page.)
A sad note was inserted in the
summer festivities with the death,
July 28, of Dr. Oliver Martin
| Johnston, emeritus professor of
| Romanic languages. Dr. Johnston,
who was 8(i, died at his campus
home on Alvarado Row.
Of the many conferences and spe
cial meetings held on campus dur
ing the summer quarter, perhaps
the largest and most noted was the
Twelfth Annual Business Confer
ence, held here July 20 to 25 arid
sponsored by the School of Busi
ness. More than 450 businessmen
enrolled.
Erwin D. Canham, editor of the
Christian Science Monitor, was fea
tured speaker, delivering a series of

five lectures entitled "The New Di
mensions of Business Leadership,"
m which he discussed business mor
ality.
Two Stanford professors, Jack
Posin and Harold Fisher, also ad
dressed the businessmen. Posin dis
cussed current conditions within
the Soviet Union and her satellites
and Fisher talked about the United
States' present role in international
politics.
Other conferences held this sum
mer included a workshop on Amer
ican history, held July 28 to Aug. 2;
a workshop on physical therapy,
Aug. 4; a seminar on education in
California, July 28 and 29.
The Executive Committee,
which during the summer is an
appointive body without any per
manent legislative powers, fin
ished its session by voting three
to two in favor of a resolution
giving students the undisputed
light to leave a classroom with
their examination papers. The
recommendation will be submit
ted to (his term's committee for
final action.
The question of whether a stu
dent had the right to take an exam
from a classroom was brought offi
cially before the summer committee
by Dean H. Donald Winbigler who
explained there was no clear rule
in the Honor Code defining the
practice. He reported that some
members of the faculty are con
cerned over the number of students
who take tests from examination
rooms.
The Drama Department presented
two well - l'eceived productions,
"Second Threshold" during July and
"Henry IV, Part I," in August.
The eight - week session closed
Aug. 18. Some departments—engi
eering and the Business School
among them — had a few courses
that covered a 10-week period.

activities.
This summer, particularly, was

a Inisy one, socially and adminis
tratively, for both faculty mem
bers and students.
In fact, some students wlio have
attended summer sessions in ilie
past said this year's was by far the
isnost active.
The quarter got under way June
24, 11) days after 2,270 seniors and
graduate students paraded into
Frost Memorial Amphitheater in
the sixty - second Commencement
exercise.
And it pot. off to a fast start: 2,173
students registered, most of them

for graduate study, making for one
of the largest summer enrollments
in the University's history.
The summer social calendar
was ollicially inaugurated on June
»I a( a reception in the spacious
v inner square of Lagunita Court.
The event, which was aimed at
new students, was sponsored by
the Associated Students of Stan
ford University. Five hundred
students attended.
The reception was followed up by
another welcoming event, a water
melon feed and swimming party at
the Women's Pool on June 28.
Arranging these and other activi
ties were the three top ASSU offi
cers. for the summer, Student Body
President Fran Kirk, Vice - Presi
dent Lucie Welles, and Student
Manager Jim Banks.
Heading the University admin
istration for the summer was Pro
vost Douglas Whitaker who pre
sided in the absence of President
J. E. Wallace Sterling. Dr. Ster
ling left early in the summer for a
three months' tour of Europe. He
arrived back on campus and re
sumed bis duties late last week.
In a permanent administrative
change, it was announced early in
the summer that I. James Quillen,
professor of education, would suc
ceed Dean A. John llartky as head
of the School of Education. Dr.
Bartky submitted his resignation
late in' May, giving as his reason a
desire to spend more time writing.
He will continue as professor of ed
ucation. (For details of this shift,
see elsewhere on this page.)
The summer Executive Commit
tee, acting on a suggestion by Kirk,
voted on July 8 to sponsor open
discussions on academic freedom,
long a topic of agitated debate on
this and other campuses.
The first academic freedom dis
cussion, held July 14, attracted

about 50 students. Many views were
represented, and the discussions
were continued on a weekly basis
through the quarter. Kirk presided
at the meetings, which drew stu
dents from almost every depart
ment.
The group topped off their sum
mer activity with a debate on
whether legislative eom m i 1.1. ee s
should investigate Communist influ
ences in colleges, winch was held
before an almost capacity audience
in Cubberley Auditorium Aug. 7.
The ASSU invited an ex-cavalry
colonel, Wheaton Brewer, currently
an advertising executive for Cali
fornia Farmer's Magazine, and John
H. Edwards, a University of Califor
nia English instructor, and Monrad
Paulson, of the law school here, to
debate the issue. Brewer held that
committees have the right and the
duty to probe suspected subversion
in colleges. The other two main
tained, however, that current com
mittee practices made such inqui
ries decidedly harmful.
Another big ASSU project this
summer was the sponsorship of
an outdoor concert, the first ever
to be held here. The concert, an
all-Mozart presentation, was held
July 17 on the expansive lawns of
the Knoll and attracted 1,000 mu
sic lovers from campus and near
by communities.
Natalie Bodanya, Metropolitan
Opera soprano, and Richard Cum
ming, pianist, were soloists, and
Professor Sandor Salgo of the Music
Department led the 30-piece en
semble. Profits from the concert
went into a summer scholarship
fund for women.
A benefit program of internation
al scope went into effect this sum
mer when the University initiated
a scheme to aid in the rehabilita
tion of the University of .the Phil
ippines in Manila. The project,

which was announced July 10 by
Provost Whitaker, will lie financed
by the U.S. Mutual Security Agency
and provides that Stanford send an
nually eight faculty specialists to
the war-wrecked institution. Paul
H. Hanna of the School of Educa
tion will act as co-ordinator of the
program.
In announcing the University's
action, Provost Whitaker said, "Our
first hope is that our efforts may
eventually bring to all these people
a full share of peaceful prosperity
and contentment. But our most rev
erent wish is that it may give rise
to a lasting new era of mutual un
derstanding, sympathy, and co-op
eration between Asia and America."
On July Hi came the startling
word that the Board of Trustees,
meeting in San Francisco, had de
cided to move the Stanford Medical
School from its long-time home in
San Francisco to quarters which
will be constructed on campus.
Lloyd Dinkelspicl, president of the
board, in telling of the decision, said
such a shift most likely would take
from three to five years. (For f'ur
. ther details see elsewhere on this
page.)
A sad note was inserted in the
summer festivities with the death,
July 28, of Dr. Oliver Martin
| Johnston, emeritus professor of
| Romanic languages. Dr. Johnston,
who was 8(i, died at his campus
home on Alvarado Row.
Of the many conferences and spe
cial meetings held on campus dur
ing the summer quarter, perhaps
the largest and most noted was the
Twelfth Annual Business Confer
ence, held here July 20 to 25 arid
sponsored by the School of Busi
ness. More than 450 businessmen
enrolled.
Erwin D. Canham, editor of the
Christian Science Monitor, was fea
tured speaker, delivering a series of

five lectures entitled "The New Di
mensions of Business Leadership,"
m which he discussed business mor
ality.
Two Stanford professors, Jack
Posin and Harold Fisher, also ad
dressed the businessmen. Posin dis
cussed current conditions within
the Soviet Union and her satellites
and Fisher talked about the United
States' present role in international
politics.
Other conferences held this sum
mer included a workshop on Amer
ican history, held July 28 to Aug. 2;
a workshop on physical therapy,
Aug. 4; a seminar on education in
California, July 28 and 29.
The Executive Committee,
which during the summer is an
appointive body without any per
manent legislative powers, fin
ished its session by voting three
to two in favor of a resolution
giving students the undisputed
light to leave a classroom with
their examination papers. The
recommendation will be submit
ted to (his term's committee for
final action.
The question of whether a stu
dent had the right to take an exam
from a classroom was brought offi
cially before the summer committee
by Dean H. Donald Winbigler who
explained there was no clear rule
in the Honor Code defining the
practice. He reported that some
members of the faculty are con
cerned over the number of students
who take tests from examination
rooms.
The Drama Department presented
two well - l'eceived productions,
"Second Threshold" during July and
"Henry IV, Part I," in August.
The eight - week session closed
Aug. 18. Some departments—engi
eering and the Business School
among them — had a few courses
that covered a 10-week period.
Things might look quiet and

24, 11) days after 2,270 seniors and
graduate students paraded into
Frost Memorial Amphitheater in
the sixty - second Commencement
exercise.
And it pot. off to a fast start: 2,173
students registered, most of them

for graduate study, making for one
of the largest summer enrollments
in the University's history.
The summer social calendar
was ollicially inaugurated on June
»I a( a reception in the spacious
v inner square of Lagunita Court.
The event, which was aimed at
new students, was sponsored by
the Associated Students of Stan
ford University. Five hundred
students attended.
The reception was followed up by
another welcoming event, a water
melon feed and swimming party at
the Women's Pool on June 28.
Arranging these and other activi
ties were the three top ASSU offi
cers. for the summer, Student Body
President Fran Kirk, Vice - Presi
dent Lucie Welles, and Student
Manager Jim Banks.
Heading the University admin
istration for the summer was Pro
vost Douglas Whitaker who pre
sided in the absence of President
J. E. Wallace Sterling. Dr. Ster
ling left early in the summer for a
three months' tour of Europe. He
arrived back on campus and re
sumed bis duties late last week.
In a permanent administrative
change, it was announced early in
the summer that I. James Quillen,
professor of education, would suc
ceed Dean A. John llartky as head
of the School of Education. Dr.
Bartky submitted his resignation
late in' May, giving as his reason a
desire to spend more time writing.
He will continue as professor of ed
ucation. (For details of this shift,
see elsewhere on this page.)
The summer Executive Commit
tee, acting on a suggestion by Kirk,
voted on July 8 to sponsor open
discussions on academic freedom,
long a topic of agitated debate on
this and other campuses.
The first academic freedom dis
cussion, held July 14, attracted

about 50 students. Many views were
represented, and the discussions
were continued on a weekly basis
through the quarter. Kirk presided
at the meetings, which drew stu
dents from almost every depart
ment.
The group topped off their sum
mer activity with a debate on
whether legislative eom m i 1.1. ee s
should investigate Communist influ
ences in colleges, winch was held
before an almost capacity audience
in Cubberley Auditorium Aug. 7.
The ASSU invited an ex-cavalry
colonel, Wheaton Brewer, currently
an advertising executive for Cali
fornia Farmer's Magazine, and John
H. Edwards, a University of Califor
nia English instructor, and Monrad
Paulson, of the law school here, to
debate the issue. Brewer held that
committees have the right and the
duty to probe suspected subversion
in colleges. The other two main
tained, however, that current com
mittee practices made such inqui
ries decidedly harmful.
Another big ASSU project this
summer was the sponsorship of
an outdoor concert, the first ever
to be held here. The concert, an
all-Mozart presentation, was held
July 17 on the expansive lawns of
the Knoll and attracted 1,000 mu
sic lovers from campus and near
by communities.
Natalie Bodanya, Metropolitan
Opera soprano, and Richard Cum
ming, pianist, were soloists, and
Professor Sandor Salgo of the Music
Department led the 30-piece en
semble. Profits from the concert
went into a summer scholarship
fund for women.
A benefit program of internation
al scope went into effect this sum
mer when the University initiated
a scheme to aid in the rehabilita
tion of the University of .the Phil
ippines in Manila. The project,

which was announced July 10 by
Provost Whitaker, will lie financed
by the U.S. Mutual Security Agency
and provides that Stanford send an
nually eight faculty specialists to
the war-wrecked institution. Paul
H. Hanna of the School of Educa
tion will act as co-ordinator of the
program.
In announcing the University's
action, Provost Whitaker said, "Our
first hope is that our efforts may
eventually bring to all these people
a full share of peaceful prosperity
and contentment. But our most rev
erent wish is that it may give rise
to a lasting new era of mutual un
derstanding, sympathy, and co-op
eration between Asia and America."
On July Hi came the startling
word that the Board of Trustees,
meeting in San Francisco, had de
cided to move the Stanford Medical
School from its long-time home in
San Francisco to quarters which
will be constructed on campus.
Lloyd Dinkelspicl, president of the
board, in telling of the decision, said
such a shift most likely would take
from three to five years. (For f'ur
. ther details see elsewhere on this
page.)
A sad note was inserted in the
summer festivities with the death,
July 28, of Dr. Oliver Martin
| Johnston, emeritus professor of
| Romanic languages. Dr. Johnston,
who was 8(i, died at his campus
home on Alvarado Row.
Of the many conferences and spe
cial meetings held on campus dur
ing the summer quarter, perhaps
the largest and most noted was the
Twelfth Annual Business Confer
ence, held here July 20 to 25 arid
sponsored by the School of Busi
ness. More than 450 businessmen
enrolled.
Erwin D. Canham, editor of the
Christian Science Monitor, was fea
tured speaker, delivering a series of

five lectures entitled "The New Di
mensions of Business Leadership,"
m which he discussed business mor
ality.
Two Stanford professors, Jack
Posin and Harold Fisher, also ad
dressed the businessmen. Posin dis
cussed current conditions within
the Soviet Union and her satellites
and Fisher talked about the United
States' present role in international
politics.
Other conferences held this sum
mer included a workshop on Amer
ican history, held July 28 to Aug. 2;
a workshop on physical therapy,
Aug. 4; a seminar on education in
California, July 28 and 29.
The Executive Committee,
which during the summer is an
appointive body without any per
manent legislative powers, fin
ished its session by voting three
to two in favor of a resolution
giving students the undisputed
light to leave a classroom with
their examination papers. The
recommendation will be submit
ted to (his term's committee for
final action.
The question of whether a stu
dent had the right to take an exam
from a classroom was brought offi
cially before the summer committee
by Dean H. Donald Winbigler who
explained there was no clear rule
in the Honor Code defining the
practice. He reported that some
members of the faculty are con
cerned over the number of students
who take tests from examination
rooms.
The Drama Department presented
two well - l'eceived productions,
"Second Threshold" during July and
"Henry IV, Part I," in August.
The eight - week session closed
Aug. 18. Some departments—engi
eering and the Business School
among them — had a few courses
that covered a 10-week period.
Things might look quiet and
riull on tho Stanford campus

There might be lower cars

This summer, particularly, was

in the University's history.
The summer social calendar
was ollicially inaugurated on June
»I a( a reception in the spacious
v inner square of Lagunita Court.
The event, which was aimed at
new students, was sponsored by
the Associated Students of Stan
ford University. Five hundred
students attended.
The reception was followed up by
another welcoming event, a water
melon feed and swimming party at
the Women's Pool on June 28.
Arranging these and other activi
ties were the three top ASSU offi
cers. for the summer, Student Body
President Fran Kirk, Vice - Presi
dent Lucie Welles, and Student
Manager Jim Banks.
Heading the University admin
istration for the summer was Pro
vost Douglas Whitaker who pre
sided in the absence of President
J. E. Wallace Sterling. Dr. Ster
ling left early in the summer for a
three months' tour of Europe. He
arrived back on campus and re
sumed bis duties late last week.
In a permanent administrative
change, it was announced early in
the summer that I. James Quillen,
professor of education, would suc
ceed Dean A. John llartky as head
of the School of Education. Dr.
Bartky submitted his resignation
late in' May, giving as his reason a
desire to spend more time writing.
He will continue as professor of ed
ucation. (For details of this shift,
see elsewhere on this page.)
The summer Executive Commit
tee, acting on a suggestion by Kirk,
voted on July 8 to sponsor open
discussions on academic freedom,
long a topic of agitated debate on
this and other campuses.
The first academic freedom dis
cussion, held July 14, attracted

about 50 students. Many views were
represented, and the discussions
were continued on a weekly basis
through the quarter. Kirk presided
at the meetings, which drew stu
dents from almost every depart
ment.
The group topped off their sum
mer activity with a debate on
whether legislative eom m i 1.1. ee s
should investigate Communist influ
ences in colleges, winch was held
before an almost capacity audience
in Cubberley Auditorium Aug. 7.
The ASSU invited an ex-cavalry
colonel, Wheaton Brewer, currently
an advertising executive for Cali
fornia Farmer's Magazine, and John
H. Edwards, a University of Califor
nia English instructor, and Monrad
Paulson, of the law school here, to
debate the issue. Brewer held that
committees have the right and the
duty to probe suspected subversion
in colleges. The other two main
tained, however, that current com
mittee practices made such inqui
ries decidedly harmful.
Another big ASSU project this
summer was the sponsorship of
an outdoor concert, the first ever
to be held here. The concert, an
all-Mozart presentation, was held
July 17 on the expansive lawns of
the Knoll and attracted 1,000 mu
sic lovers from campus and near
by communities.
Natalie Bodanya, Metropolitan
Opera soprano, and Richard Cum
ming, pianist, were soloists, and
Professor Sandor Salgo of the Music
Department led the 30-piece en
semble. Profits from the concert
went into a summer scholarship
fund for women.
A benefit program of internation
al scope went into effect this sum
mer when the University initiated
a scheme to aid in the rehabilita
tion of the University of .the Phil
ippines in Manila. The project,

which was announced July 10 by
Provost Whitaker, will lie financed
by the U.S. Mutual Security Agency
and provides that Stanford send an
nually eight faculty specialists to
the war-wrecked institution. Paul
H. Hanna of the School of Educa
tion will act as co-ordinator of the
program.
In announcing the University's
action, Provost Whitaker said, "Our
first hope is that our efforts may
eventually bring to all these people
a full share of peaceful prosperity
and contentment. But our most rev
erent wish is that it may give rise
to a lasting new era of mutual un
derstanding, sympathy, and co-op
eration between Asia and America."
On July Hi came the startling
word that the Board of Trustees,
meeting in San Francisco, had de
cided to move the Stanford Medical
School from its long-time home in
San Francisco to quarters which
will be constructed on campus.
Lloyd Dinkelspicl, president of the
board, in telling of the decision, said
such a shift most likely would take
from three to five years. (For f'ur
. ther details see elsewhere on this
page.)
A sad note was inserted in the
summer festivities with the death,
July 28, of Dr. Oliver Martin
| Johnston, emeritus professor of
| Romanic languages. Dr. Johnston,
who was 8(i, died at his campus
home on Alvarado Row.
Of the many conferences and spe
cial meetings held on campus dur
ing the summer quarter, perhaps
the largest and most noted was the
Twelfth Annual Business Confer
ence, held here July 20 to 25 arid
sponsored by the School of Busi
ness. More than 450 businessmen
enrolled.
Erwin D. Canham, editor of the
Christian Science Monitor, was fea
tured speaker, delivering a series of

five lectures entitled "The New Di
mensions of Business Leadership,"
m which he discussed business mor
ality.
Two Stanford professors, Jack
Posin and Harold Fisher, also ad
dressed the businessmen. Posin dis
cussed current conditions within
the Soviet Union and her satellites
and Fisher talked about the United
States' present role in international
politics.
Other conferences held this sum
mer included a workshop on Amer
ican history, held July 28 to Aug. 2;
a workshop on physical therapy,
Aug. 4; a seminar on education in
California, July 28 and 29.
The Executive Committee,
which during the summer is an
appointive body without any per
manent legislative powers, fin
ished its session by voting three
to two in favor of a resolution
giving students the undisputed
light to leave a classroom with
their examination papers. The
recommendation will be submit
ted to (his term's committee for
final action.
The question of whether a stu
dent had the right to take an exam
from a classroom was brought offi
cially before the summer committee
by Dean H. Donald Winbigler who
explained there was no clear rule
in the Honor Code defining the
practice. He reported that some
members of the faculty are con
cerned over the number of students
who take tests from examination
rooms.
The Drama Department presented
two well - l'eceived productions,
"Second Threshold" during July and
"Henry IV, Part I," in August.
The eight - week session closed
Aug. 18. Some departments—engi
eering and the Business School
among them — had a few courses
that covered a 10-week period.
