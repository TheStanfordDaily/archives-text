# Stanford Med School To Move to Campus
## 
### BOB REZAK Associate Editor, The Daily 
The University's Medical School will be shifted from San Fran
cisco to the main campus in a move that is expected to take an
estimated three to five years at a cost yet to be determined.
The announcement, made by the Stanford Board of Trustees at
its July meeting, followed a year-long study of the Stanford

Medical School and of medical cd-"
ucation nationally, and squashed
rumors in past years that Stanford
would abandon its hospital, Medi
cal School, or both.
And the announcement empha
sized the belief that a hospital is an
inherent and indispensable part of
a school of medicine, and that Stan
ford will have a hospital.
One of the trustees' resolutions
stated that ". . . The continuance
of a medical school of high standard
is an important and integral part of
Stanford's status as a university."
University President Wallacc
Sterling, in a written report to
(he trustees, said that "the key
relationship of medical education
and science to other scientific
fields can best be strengthened
and advanced by bringing the
Mcdical School into the closest
possible physical and intellectual
relationship to the whole Univer
sity."
It is hoped that the money to
finance construction of the new
Medical School buildings can be ob
tained by private gifts rather than
by a subscription campaign.
The buildings will probably be lo
rn led somewhere in the general
area between the Palo Alto Hospi
tal and the present anatomy and
bacteriology laboratories which are
directly behind the Stanford Mu
seum.
The first year of the medical
course is now conducted on the
campus in these buildings.
I.loyd VV. Dinkclspicl, president
of the University's Board of Trus
tees, said that it was hoped that
a way of adequately using the
hospital facilities in San Fran
cisco will he found "so that they
loo may serve Stanford and the

community."
Stanford currently appears on its
way to possessing two medical
schools—one for undergraduates on
the campus and one for graduates
in San Francisco.
Eighty-two doctors on the medi
cal faculty, establishing themselves
as the Stanford Clinical Group, or
ganized early last month in an ef
fort to keep Stanford Hospital in
San Francisco in operation when
the move is made.
The group hopes to maintain the
hospital's private and charity wards.
The plan of the doctors to
maintain a self-supporting hos
pital and graduate school in San
Francisco — which would be the
first postgraduate medical center
in (he West—drew this comment
from Dinkclspiel:
"If the program is developed for
a postgraduate school of medi
cine under Stanford auspices, i
maintained on a self - supporting
basis, I feci confident that the |
trustees would make the facilities
j available for that purpose."
Dinkclspiel said the trustees j
"view with sympathy and open
minds the intentions of these doe
tors.
"We have assured the faculty," be
said, "that there will be no hasty
disposal by the trustees of the hos
pital properties. Every opportunity
will be given to them to work out
with the University, or independ
ently, as may develop, a program
for the use of the facilities, if that
| proves to be feasible."
A committee of nine Stanford
Medical School faculty tnembei
was appointed late last month to
study use and disposition of the
Stanford-Lane Hospitals and othei
facilities in San Francisco after the
Medical School is consolidated on
the campus.
The Medical School buildings in
San Francisco include Lane Hos
pital, a teaching hospital with l!) 2
beds; the 214-bcd Stanford Uni
versity Hospital for private pa
tients; the Clinical and Labora
tory Building; Ruth Lucie Stern
Research Laboratory; Lane IMed
ical Laboratory; and the Stanford
School of Nursing.
Dinkclspiel said that the problems
involved in the removal of the Med
ical School arc "challenging."
"More than that," he said, "they
. are downright difficult. The study
i of location and functions of the
. school was carefully made and the
i conclusions readied are, the ti n te< ,
Ii believe, fundamentally sound."
