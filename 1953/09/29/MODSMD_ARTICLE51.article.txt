### BOB REZAK Associate Editor, The Daily 
The University's Medical School will be shifted from San Fran
cisco to the main campus in a move that is expected to take an
estimated three to five years at a cost yet to be determined.
The announcement, made by the Stanford Board of Trustees at
its July meeting, followed a year-long study of the Stanford

Medical School and of medical cd-"
ucation nationally, and squashed
rumors in past years that Stanford
would abandon its hospital, Medi
cal School, or both.
And the announcement empha
sized the belief that a hospital is an
inherent and indispensable part of
a school of medicine, and that Stan
ford will have a hospital.
One of the trustees' resolutions
stated that ". . . The continuance
of a medical school of high standard
is an important and integral part of
Stanford's status as a university."
University President Wallacc
Sterling, in a written report to

relationship of medical education
and science to other scientific
fields can best be strengthened
and advanced by bringing the
Mcdical School into the closest
possible physical and intellectual
relationship to the whole Univer
sity."
It is hoped that the money to
finance construction of the new
Medical School buildings can be ob

by a subscription campaign.
The buildings will probably be lo

area between the Palo Alto Hospi

bacteriology laboratories which are
directly behind the Stanford Mu
seum.
The first year of the medical
course is now conducted on the
campus in these buildings.
I.loyd VV. Dinkclspicl, president
of the University's Board of Trus
tees, said that it was hoped that
a way of adequately using the
hospital facilities in San Fran
cisco will he found "so that they
loo may serve Stanford and the

community."
Stanford currently appears on its
way to possessing two medical
schools—one for undergraduates on
the campus and one for graduates
in San Francisco.
Eighty-two doctors on the medi
cal faculty, establishing themselves
as the Stanford Clinical Group, or
ganized early last month in an ef
fort to keep Stanford Hospital in
San Francisco in operation when
the move is made.
The group hopes to maintain the
hospital's private and charity wards.
The plan of the doctors to
maintain a self-supporting hos
pital and graduate school in San
Francisco — which would be the
first postgraduate medical center
in (he West—drew this comment
from Dinkclspiel:
"If the program is developed for
