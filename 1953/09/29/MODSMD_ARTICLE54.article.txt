# Yanks, Dodgers Stampede Loops
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
The major leagues closed their seasons Sunday, and it was a
race right down to the wire in both leagues. The only thing is,
the close race was not in the team standings.
For, as everyone has known they would since the first of July,
the New York Yankees and the Brooklyn Dodgers waltzed to

their fifth and second straight pen
nants, respectively. The Yankees
rolled over the Indians by B'l
games, warning just one game less
than the magic 100 and dropping 52.
Brooklyn won 105 games, "nosing
out" Milwaukee by 13 contests.
The close races were for the bat
ting titles. In the American League,
Cleveland's Al Rosen trailed Wash
ington's Mickey Vernon with just
one day to play, .333 to .330. On
Sunday Rosen, intentionally moved
to the lead-off spot, pounded ot
three hits in five times at bat, to
raise his average to .3364, but Ver
non garnered two-for-four to end
with .3371, so the Indian slugger,
who won both the home run and
RBI titles, lost the triple crown by
.seven ten-thousandths of a percen
tage point.
In the National, Carl Furillo end
ed his regular season batting with
a .344 mark. An injury incurred in
a brawl with Leo Durocher side
lined him. Thus Red Schoendienst,
two points below Furillo's mark,
needed two for four or three for
five to overtake him. His two for
five left him just a fraction short.
One unusual feature oi the season
was the fact that only one manager
lost his job, despite runaway races.
Rogers Hoinsby, released two weeks
ago by Cincinnati, has yet to be re
placed.
For a while in the pitching de
partment it looked as if the majors
were going to have their first 30-
ga/ne winner in two, decades with
the Phils' Robin Roberts. At one
time he had a 19-and-7 record. For
some reason, perhaps latigue, he

slumped terribly the last ten weeks,
finishing with a mark of 23-10. Tht
senior circuit had three other 20-
game winners, Carl Erskine of the
Dodgers (20-0), Harvy lladdix ol
the Cardinals (20-9), and Warren
Spahn of the Braves (22-7).
The American League also had
four hurlers to reach the 20 mark
Mel Parnell of Boston (21-8), 80l
Porterfield of Washington (22-10)
Virgil Trucks of Chicago (20-10)
and the workhorse of the league.
Bob Lemon of Cleveland (22-15).
The biggest surprise of the year
| was the showing of the new Mil
waukee Braves, both physically
and financially. Picked for sev
enth place, they finished in sec
ond. Most gratifying was the at
tendance, which broke the old
NL record for customers in a sea
son.
Abo surprising was the showing
of exMarine Ted Williams, who re
turned from Korea to hit a blister
ing .411. Although he is in the
latter part of bis baseball career,
| the Red Sox look for him to
strengthen their club next year.
The outlook for next season?
Not 100 ,*;Ood for most of the
clubs. For the Yankees are rely
ing less and less on their veter
ans, and the youngsters such as
Mantle, Ford, Martin, McDon-
Kahl. and (next season) Coleman
1 are taking over. The Dodgers
figure to be helped considerably
ill lttfi-J by the return of
Don Newconibe, who is due for a
military discharge.

were going to have their first 30-
ga/ne winner in two, decades with
the Phils' Robin Roberts. At one
time he had a 19-and-7 record. For
some reason, perhaps latigue, he

slumped terribly the last ten weeks,
finishing with a mark of 23-10. Tht
senior circuit had three other 20-
game winners, Carl Erskine of the
Dodgers (20-0), Harvy lladdix ol
the Cardinals (20-9), and Warren
Spahn of the Braves (22-7).
The American League also had
four hurlers to reach the 20 mark
Mel Parnell of Boston (21-8), 80l
Porterfield of Washington (22-10)
Virgil Trucks of Chicago (20-10)
and the workhorse of the league.
Bob Lemon of Cleveland (22-15).
The biggest surprise of the year
| was the showing of the new Mil
waukee Braves, both physically
and financially. Picked for sev
enth place, they finished in sec
ond. Most gratifying was the at
tendance, which broke the old
NL record for customers in a sea
son.
Abo surprising was the showing
of exMarine Ted Williams, who re
turned from Korea to hit a blister
ing .411. Although he is in the
latter part of bis baseball career,
| the Red Sox look for him to
strengthen their club next year.
The outlook for next season?
Not 100 ,*;Ood for most of the
clubs. For the Yankees are rely
ing less and less on their veter
ans, and the youngsters such as
Mantle, Ford, Martin, McDon-
Kahl. and (next season) Coleman
1 are taking over. The Dodgers
figure to be helped considerably
ill lttfi-J by the return of
Don Newconibe, who is due for a
military discharge.
The major leagues closed their seasons Sunday, and it was a
race right down to the wire in both leagues. The only thing is,
the close race was not in the team standings.
For, as everyone has known they would since the first of July,
the New York Yankees and the Brooklyn Dodgers waltzed to

their fifth and second straight pen
nants, respectively. The Yankees
rolled over the Indians by B'l
games, warning just one game less
than the magic 100 and dropping 52.
Brooklyn won 105 games, "nosing
out" Milwaukee by 13 contests.
The close races were for the bat
ting titles. In the American League,
Cleveland's Al Rosen trailed Wash
ington's Mickey Vernon with just
one day to play, .333 to .330. On
Sunday Rosen, intentionally moved
to the lead-off spot, pounded ot
three hits in five times at bat, to
raise his average to .3364, but Ver
non garnered two-for-four to end
with .3371, so the Indian slugger,
who won both the home run and
RBI titles, lost the triple crown by
.seven ten-thousandths of a percen
tage point.
In the National, Carl Furillo end
ed his regular season batting with
a .344 mark. An injury incurred in
a brawl with Leo Durocher side
lined him. Thus Red Schoendienst,
two points below Furillo's mark,
needed two for four or three for
five to overtake him. His two for
five left him just a fraction short.
One unusual feature oi the season
was the fact that only one manager
lost his job, despite runaway races.
Rogers Hoinsby, released two weeks
ago by Cincinnati, has yet to be re
placed.

partment it looked as if the majors
