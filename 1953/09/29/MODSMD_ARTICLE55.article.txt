miu now to the basic question of ''How good (or bad) Ts Stanford
this year?" This is never.an easy question to answer in early season,
and even more dillicult Ibis year, because of the multifarious aspects
that have arisen with the disappearance of platoon football.
For example, it is difficult to compare this year's team w'tli last year's,
because last season there were two teams of specialists who worked on
nothing their forte. And this fall several heretofore strictly offense
men, such as Bob Garrett, Jar vis Wat.on, and Sam • Morley, are bavin
trouble making the switch. But then so are players oif every team in
the FCC. We think that Chuck Taylor has a slightly strorigci line tin
year, with the great Norm Manoogiari back, and a slightly weakei back
field, sans Bob Mathias and Skip Crist.
But to pursue this further, it is or opinion that, every team in the
PCC except UCLA and possibly Oregon is not the same ealibei thai
it was last year. Here are our ratings:
1. UCLA 5. Oregon
2. DSC (i. Washington State
.'I. Stanford 7. Washington
4. Cal X. OSC
UCLA, as long as devastating Haul Cameron stays healthy, should be
torrid. And the rojans, although considerably weaker defensively than
last year, should still be brutishly good.
Ked-thatched Chuck Taylor's underlings could surprise a lot of people
if three "ifs" materialize.
I. (112 Stanford takes advantage of its most potent weapon, the sharp
passing combo of (iarrett to Morley and Steinberg. So far, the Indians
have been guilty of woefully neglecting the forward pass.
2. If a trio of really promising soph backs develop . . . namely Ernie
Dorn, Bill Tarr, and Jim Truher. When these three have some game
experience under their belts by the end ul the sea on, they could spark
the Indians to unexpected heights.
3. If Stanford's middle defense stays uninjured. For my money, there's
no middle defense in the league as strong as guard:, Phil Wilson and All-
American candidate Norm Manoogian, tackle Malt Armitage, and center
linebacker Ted Tanner.
A happy concluding note: This may well be (be year that the Cards
beat Cal. Yeah, 1 know, there's a chorus of voices from the gallery
saying, "We heard that last year, and the year before that, and, as a
matter of fact, for six straight years." True, the Indians have had an
unblemished record of unsuccess against the Bears for ;ix years, but
Cal is at low ebb this year, and the Card > could develop to be a very
strong team. Yes sir, cynics be damned, this is the year we beat Cal.
And 1 haven't waved my pom-pom in some time.

miu now to the basic question of ''How good (or bad) Ts Stanford
this year?" This is never.an easy question to answer in early season,
and even more dillicult Ibis year, because of the multifarious aspects
that have arisen with the disappearance of platoon football.
For example, it is difficult to compare this year's team w'tli last year's,
because last season there were two teams of specialists who worked on
nothing their forte. And this fall several heretofore strictly offense
men, such as Bob Garrett, Jar vis Wat.on, and Sam • Morley, are bavin
trouble making the switch. But then so are players oif every team in
the FCC. We think that Chuck Taylor has a slightly strorigci line tin
year, with the great Norm Manoogiari back, and a slightly weakei back
field, sans Bob Mathias and Skip Crist.
But to pursue this further, it is or opinion that, every team in the
PCC except UCLA and possibly Oregon is not the same ealibei thai
it was last year. Here are our ratings:
1. UCLA 5. Oregon
2. DSC (i. Washington State
.'I. Stanford 7. Washington
4. Cal X. OSC
UCLA, as long as devastating Haul Cameron stays healthy, should be
torrid. And the rojans, although considerably weaker defensively than
last year, should still be brutishly good.
Ked-thatched Chuck Taylor's underlings could surprise a lot of people
if three "ifs" materialize.
I. (112 Stanford takes advantage of its most potent weapon, the sharp
passing combo of (iarrett to Morley and Steinberg. So far, the Indians
have been guilty of woefully neglecting the forward pass.
2. If a trio of really promising soph backs develop . . . namely Ernie
Dorn, Bill Tarr, and Jim Truher. When these three have some game
experience under their belts by the end ul the sea on, they could spark
the Indians to unexpected heights.
3. If Stanford's middle defense stays uninjured. For my money, there's
no middle defense in the league as strong as guard:, Phil Wilson and All-
American candidate Norm Manoogian, tackle Malt Armitage, and center
linebacker Ted Tanner.
A happy concluding note: This may well be (be year that the Cards
beat Cal. Yeah, 1 know, there's a chorus of voices from the gallery
saying, "We heard that last year, and the year before that, and, as a
matter of fact, for six straight years." True, the Indians have had an
unblemished record of unsuccess against the Bears for ;ix years, but
Cal is at low ebb this year, and the Card > could develop to be a very
strong team. Yes sir, cynics be damned, this is the year we beat Cal.
And 1 haven't waved my pom-pom in some time.
