Chuck Taylor summed up the af
ternoon "We made a lot of mis
! takes."
Hut none the less, lie was pleased
1 with the Big Hed eleven alter it
j held oH Oregon, 7-0, Saturday.
"The kids played more inspired
! hall today; they were working and
j fighting harder. 1 was pleased with
i tiie zip and determination, and we
, had line pursuit, particularly early
I in the game.
"All those offsides were very
disgusting and discouraging. They
showed an eagerness, however,
J which I liked."
But when fundamentals were
mentioned, Tavlov put his hands
\ to his head. "From a technical
j standpoint," he said bluntly, "we
We re terrible." And nobody ar
gued with that.
Then somebody brought up .strat
egy, particularly the plan to shuttle
quarterbacks in order to take ad
; vantage of possible Oregon weak
! nesses. "We decided against that at
j the last minute," the headman an
j swered.
"Why didn't we pass moie?" he
I repeated another query. "Well,
that was our original plan, but their
defense a wide six was strong
I against passes, and I thought we
! could run against it with more suc
cess. *
The Indian mentor was reluctant
| to comment on individual perform

anees, begging' oil until lie could
bet the lilm.s. but alter much prod
ding, he named a tew names.
"IM say Marv Tennefoss did a
pretty good job. Ol' course, yon
must remember that In's played
defense beftn'e while some of our
other ends haven't." Tennefoss
distinguished himself hy stopping
two successive plays inside the
live-yard line to hall what ap
peared to he a certain Webfoot
touchdown drive."
Words of praise were also in order
for quarterback Bob Garrett, who
intercepted two passes and cainc up
from his safety slot to stop an Ore
gon runner near the goal. "lie was
our only 00 - minute man,' Taylor
said. "I thought he did a fine job on
his calls, and he looked particularly
good on pass ileeln.se."
"Oregon is a line team, though,
isn't it?" he continued. "They
were sure picking us apart. Yes, I
would say they overpowered us.
However, we were using a slant
ing, containing type of line play.

trying to prevent a long break
away run."
Taylor wasn't worried about his
injuries; all the bruises were minor.
"Manoogian just has a bad charley
horse. Lcn Doster played the rest
of the game for Norm and did a
good job."
tint over in the other side ot the
gym Oregon's Len Casanova was
still muttering to hunsell about one
of his injuries, CJeorge Sbaw, the
Webfoots' top - flight quarterback,
was knot'ked on the head in the
first period and played the rest ol
the,half in a haze.
Casanova told the story: "Shaw
got konked on the head and
couldn't remember his patterns.
So we didn't pass much at all in
the half. I didn't find out he'd
been hurt until the four-minute
warning near the end of the sec
ond quarter. There was some
doubt about sending him bark
after the intermission, but he and
the trainer said the fu/./inness
i had cleared up."
Casanova didn't blame his quar
terback for the defeat. "We had
I plenty of opportunities, but we
t couldn't take advantage of them.''
How does Stanford compare with
j Nebraska, which tied the Cards'
[next opponent, Illinois, 21-all over
the weekend. "Stanford may have
been a little better than Nebraska,
j or wi* might not have been as sharp,
i Wait until I see the pictures."
