"THE HELL WITH '56" —That's the message that was found
smeared on the cement at the Cellar Sunday morning. Above,
Tom Peterson, chairman of the Public Relations Committee,
goes at it with a broom and paint thinner to try to remove it.
(Acording to Peterson, Cellar coffee worked better.) Identity
of the painters is unknown, although unconfirmed rumor has
