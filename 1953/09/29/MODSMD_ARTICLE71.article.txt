# MOST POWERFUL VACUUM TUBE
## Farm Scientists Double Klystron Tube Strength 
### 
The strength of the klystron—already the most powerful vac
uum lube in the world has been doubled by Stanford physicists,
it was reported at the western legional meeting of the Institute of
Radio Engineers in San Francisco this summer.
The newest model of the tube, which was invented at Stanford

high-energy physics laboratories at
the University have been named.
A group of Stanford scientists de
vised the klystron, which made pos
sible the wartime use of radar. The
tube, in addition to its use in the
Stanford accelerator, is the corner
stone of a new communications in
| dustry, including ultra-high frc-
I quency television.

30 million watts at peak power.
The klystrons now in use to power
the linear accelerator, the atom split —
! ting "grin" located in the W. W. Han
sen Laboratories at Stanford, gen
erate a maximum of 15 million watts.
The HM) per rent increase was j
attained largely by more efficient
j design, plus some increase in the |
j power input, according to John II. j
: Jasherg. A research associate at i
| Stanford, Jasberg reported at the ;
IRE meeting on the project, which
has been sponsored by the Office i
of Naval Research.
"Essentially we have put to work
some of the electrons within the tube
which have been loafing," Jasberg
explains.
The copper klystron —about the
size and shape of a lite plug—con
tains at its base a nickel cathode
finished with a special oxide coat
ing to emit, electrons.
About 400.000 volts from a bank of
condensers are applied to this cath
ode and it shoots a beam of electrons
about an inch in diameter up through
the tube. Three cavity resonators in
series convert the energy of a por
tion of the electrons to ultra-high
frequency radio waves.
In the new tube, the energy of a
vastly larger portion of the electrons
is utilized, leading to the doubled
power output.
The Stanford linear accelerator
is using 21 of the 15-niiUton watt
klystrons to speed electrons down
its 220-foot barrel to bo in hard
atomic targets. When end-station
equipment is completed, the ac
celerator will produce one billion
electron volts of energy.
The billion-volt mark might be
exceeded if the new 30-million watt;
klystrons were installed, although it
is possible that the present accelera
tor equipment could not handle the
added power, Jasberg declared.
Two of the more powerful tubes
have been built and tested at the
Hansen Laboratories by a team of
i physicists and technicians. The
work was carried on under the di
! rection of Edward L. Ginzton, di
i rector of microwave activities in
the Laboratories.
The klystron stemmed from the
invention of the cavity resonator in
the ISKSO's by the late William Web
ster Hansen, Stanford physicist in
whose honor the microwave and
