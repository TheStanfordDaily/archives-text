# Individual POW's Face Questioning
## 
### 
MUNSAN, Sept. 30 (UP)â€”The
Neutral Nations Repatriation Com
mission announced formally today
that all Korean war prisoners who
have rejected repatriation will be
subject to individual interviews as
frequently as "explainers" desire.
Thousands of anti - Communist
North Korean and Chinese prisoners
have sworn to die rather than sub
mit to explanations from Commu
nist officers.
United Nations command spokes
man immediately announced that
the U.N. would protest the rules
governing attempts to persuade re
calcitrant prisoners to return to their
homelands. The protest may come
at a commission meeting called for
4 p.m. (It p.m. PST Tuesday).
The U.N. saw its suggested rules
virtually ignored by the NNRC,
while the commission adopted al
most all the rules proposed by the
Communists.
