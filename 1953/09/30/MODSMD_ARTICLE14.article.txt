# EXCOM NOTES
## ASSU Group To Study Honor Code 
### 
The Executive Committee most
likely will appoint a special sub
committee to study possible Honor
Code revisions when it meets to
night in the committee room of the
Nitery at 7:30.
That such a committee might be
formed was revealed yesterday by
Chuck Goff, chairman of the Fun
damental Standard Committee, at a
meeting of his group in the Wom
en's Clubhouse.
Goff told his 10 - man committee
that ASSU President Don Lozab
nick had told him that he was con
sidering the appointment of a spe
cial body to investigate various as
pects of the Code, including the
question whether students should
have the right to take examination
papers from an examination room.
Members of the Fundamental
Standard Committee, after meet
ing for an hour and a half, de
clined to frame any formal rec
ommendation to Excom, pointing
out that differences of opinion on
the matter within the group arc
such that agreement at this point
is impossible.
It was explained by Goff that at
present the Honor Code, as included
in the By-Laws of the ASSU Con
stitution, contains no specific rule
covering the practice of taking tests
from a classroom.
