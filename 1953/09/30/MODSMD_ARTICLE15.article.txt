HANOI, Indochina, Sept. 29 (UP)
â€”Four Communist Viet Minh rebel
infantry divisions and a heavy ar
tillery division equipped by Com
munist China were poised today for
an attack in the Hanoi delta.
It will be the first full attack on
the rice-rich delta area in two years
| and the first time the Communists
in Indochina have teamed four di-
I visions together and backed them up
with an artillery division.
) The French command headquar
! ters said that an all-out tUck on
| the delta fortress was "definitely an
j ticipated."
In an effort to counteract the ex
-1 pected Hanoi delta assault, the
j French have launched a psychologi
cal warfare campaign against the
50,000 to 70,000 Communists massed
for the campaign.
The headquarters said 7,000,000
leaflets and 150,000 newspapers were
dropped over the rebel-held terri
tory north and west of Hanoi urging
sincere Nationalists to turn on the
Communists.
