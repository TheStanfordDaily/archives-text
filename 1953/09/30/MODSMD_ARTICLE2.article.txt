# New AFROTC Policy Explained
## 
### ROY BROUN 
Fifty men, assured' of draft de
ferments last spring quarter by
the Stanford Air Force ROTC,
have been dropped from the pro
gram and been made eligible for
induction.
These men are but a small part
of the 15,000 men anticipating
entrance into advanced AFROTC
who were denied admission in
cdlleges all over the country in
the wake of the defense cutbacks
recently announced in Washing
ton.
The Air Force took the heav
iest loss from the cutbacks, hav
ing its total projected force cut
'from 143 wings to 120 wings, and
losing approximately $5 billion
from its budget, according to Lt.
Col. Ralph W. Keller, professor
of air science and tactics at Stan
ford.
Since the ROTC's furnish the
Air Force approximately 80 per
cent of its reserve officers, the
biggest reduction in prospective
officer personnel must take place
within their ranks, he said. And

since Congressional action has
provided for an Air Force of only
120 wings, the ROTC units have
had to cut their junior contracts
from 25,000 to 10,000.
Four Categories
The revision of defense plans
has caused an extensive reor
ganization of the AFROTC pro
gram, which is now set up to
yield a much higher number of
flying personnel. The new pro
gram puts all prospective ad
vanced course students — begin
ning with the junior year—into
four categories:
I. Cadets physically qualified
to fly and who agree to apply
for flight training within 75 days
before graduation and commis
sioning.
11. Cadets pursuing degrees in
engineering and technical spe
cialties who could fill technical
jobs with the Air Force.
111. All remaining cadets.
IV. Veterans back in school
and enrolled in AFROTC. At
present Stanford is not affected
by this category.

Men dropped from the program
fell into categories II and 111,
technical specialties and admin
istrative personnel. All but five
cadets in category 111 at Stanford
now have been dropped, and 16
remain in 11. The flying category
quota remains unlimited.
Senior Cadets
Senior cadets in categories II
and 111 are being allowed to com
plete the program, but most in
111 will not receive commissions
upon graduation. Instead, they
will receive certificates of com
pletion, and must spend two
years on active duty as enlisted
men or airmen. At the comple
tion of the two years, either in
the Air Force or under the Se
lective Service laws, the men
will receive reserve commissions
in the Air Force.
This plan for non-flight senior
cadets was announced recently
at a press conference by John A.
Hannah, Assistant Secretary for
Defense. He unfolded the plan
as the long-sought solution to
the problem of the oversupply of

college seniors in the AFROTC
created by the budget cutbacks
and lowered personnel ceilings.
Hannah also confirmed the
previous announcement that all
seniors who have signed for
flight training will receive their
commissions with their diplomas.
Some Exceptions
Exceptions will be made for
about 1,000 men from all the
ROTC's in categories II and 111
who have special skills. These
men will be commissioned upon
graduation, but the rest will
have to go into the ranks or take
their chances with the draft.
There are between 13,000 and
14,000 seniors now in the AF
ROTC, and under the new man
power ceiling revisions, the serv
ice expects to have a little less
than 9,600 active officer vacan
cies.
This plan does not apply to
junior cadets who have been se
lected to continue in the pro
gram. Juniors who complete the
four-year program at Stanford
will probably be commissioned

upon graduation and called to
active duty soon after, aceorauv
to Col. Keller. However, a cer
tificate of completion may be
given to some men in categoric
II and 111, and they win Lave + o
serve in the ranks.
Freshman AFROTC
Although the AFROTC at
Stanford is continuing it.; policy
of taking unlimited freshman en
rollments, the deferment quel:,
has not yet been released. Last
year's quota was 85 per cent.
Freshman cadets will take
physical examinations and flight
aptitude tests early autumn
quarter to determine their pil.>
capabilities. Col. Keller has
warned that the chances of con
tinuing through four years ol
air ROTC are slim for men who
cannot pass the flying require
ments.
However, due to the posibility
of greatly increased draft calh
in the fiscal year beginning July
1, 1954, Keller believes "The best
chance for a man to complete
his college program is in an
ROTC program."
