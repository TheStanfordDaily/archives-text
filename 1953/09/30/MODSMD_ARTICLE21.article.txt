# Help, Don't Harm Your Excom
## 
### 
Tonight when the gavel falls on the big oval
table in the Excom room of the Union, the legis
lative body of the Associated Students will be
gin its first meeting of the year.
Wielding the gavel will be Don Lozabnick,
elected last spring by you, the student body, to
serve as ASSU president this year. Seated
around Lozabnick will be eighteen other stu
dents-men and women, sophomores and grad
uates —also popularly elected, who represent
both classes and living areas. (The freshmen,
who will elect their class representative later,
will be temporarily represented by three cur
rent Excom members.)
There is usually a segment of a university
population (and we do not claim that writers
of this newspaper have always been exclud
ed from this category) that takes a certain
pleasure in ridiculing the student legislator—
especially when that official leaves himself
open to accusations of ignorance, preten
tiousness, or verbosity.
There will be times, of course, when such
labels will be deserved. But here are some

facts to consider: for every minute that an Ex
com representative delivers an opinion, there
are seventeen during which he must sit back
and listen. And for every hour that he spends
at the actual weekly meeting of Excom there
are two that find him contacting members of
his constituency, compiling reports, or serving
on a fact-finding committee.
The role of a student legislator is a thank
less one. Your representatives need yo.ur
9 advice, your complaints, your opinions. With
out ascertaining them they cannot serve you,
and the term "representative" becomes a
misnomer.
What your Excom representative does not
need is your idle criticism of his work, ad
dressed to everyone but himself.
If you have a problem, by all means, air it.
But tell it to your representative whose power
and duty it is to alleviate it.
To generally ridicule the person you elected
to handle your problems does no good, and it
does the harm of degrading the very power
established to help you. —Sue Wheat
