### PETE GROTHE 
I think that I shall never see
An advertisement lovely as a tree.
Indeed, unless the billboards fall,
I'll never see a tree at all.
. â€”Ogden Nash
I am not thoroughly convinced that Duz is doing
everything, that there is necessarily "something about
a Muntz TV," that all dogs are speaking for Gaines,
nor that that cow up on the hill

who chews chlorophyll all day
long is free of smells.
About the only thing that I ,
am convinced if is that advertisers
are waging a frantic battle to see
who can nauseate the consumers
most with the most superlative
superlatives. In fact, the other
day I overheard one advertiser
ask another, '"How are things
going?"

The answer was, ''Colossal, but
they're improving.''
The ad that; throws me for the greatest loss is the
one of a large milk company. A magazine has a full
page color picture showing an attractive hostess
entertaining a guest in her dining room. There is
only one trouble. Her guest is a cow. Now, just what
does one say when he has a cow for a guest. Does
lie say, "A little more in the coffee, please," or "No
thanks, I take mine black?" This is a situation call
ing for striped pants diplomacy.
in another magazine I notice a picture of star Phila
delphia Athletics' pitcher Bobby Shantz. He is pitch

ing a ball, and the ball has writing on it: "Here's how
to shutout perspiration odor!" And then Shantz is
quoted as saying, "Take this straight pitch from me,
fans: There's no substitute for Mennen Spray Deo
dorant to keep a man nice-smelling in any league."
I trust that Mr. Shantz sprays a lot on before each
game. After all, what player wants to slide into
second half-safe?
The sponsor of Sergeant's Dog Care products has
a picture of a sad, watery-eyed Boxer dog lying on
the floor and looking off into space. Next to him is a
dilapidated-looking rubber cat. Under the picture,
we read, "He just doesn't feel like playing. That's his
toy, and usually he's begging you to help him play
with it. What's happened to him? Listlessness, watery
eyes, loss of appetite, may mean this dog has worms."
Worms, hell. If I were a dog and the only plaything
I had was that stinkin'-looking cat, I'd have sad,
watery eyes too.
Then there's the strip that shows Mr. Jones working
in the garden. Suddenly, a little green man with a
fiendish leer sticks him in the back with a pitchfork.
"Oh," screams Mr. Jones, "I've been struck with
the pains of neuritis and neuralgia."
Neuritis and neuralgia, hell! Anyone with two eyes
can see that there's a little green man with a pitch
fork in his back.
Maybe some day Einstein or someone will invent a
pill that does away with advertisements. And then
we'll be able to go to a store and buy whatever we
want without being prodded on by a sad, watery-eyed
dog. a little green man with a pitchfork, or a dining
room cow.
