"Stanford University gives the
student every facility for a well
rounded education: academics,
extra-curricular activities, and
sports," declared Ludger Schip
penkoetti, who visited campus
for two days, leaving yesterday.
The tall, btond German, who
spent last year at Harvard Uni
versity studying' law and political
science, is a' representative of the
National Union of Students, a Ger
man organization started after the
war, which is composed of all West
German universities.
Ludger came to Harvard two
years ago as a guest of the State De
partment and the National Student
Association.
Commenting on his stay at
Harvard. Ludger mentioned how
much the extra - currieular life
was stressed, much more so than
in a German university, where
students live at home or in apart
ments instead of in dorms.
"In America there is a much more
highly organized community life;
however, there is the danger that
the student merely rushes from one
activity to another and neglects to
contemplate," he declared.
Ludger came to Stanford mainly
to see how the ASSU program of
foreign scholars is administered,
but also, he confesses, "from a high
ly personal interest to see the Uni
versity."
' I was impressed by the unique
picture of Stanford," he declared.
"The campus seems so well organ
ized, in contrast to Harvard, where

one sees architecture from every
period. I may safely say that I have
never seen a university in the Unit
ed States like Stanford, architec
turally speaking."
Asked to compare the students
of American and German univer
sities, Ludger said that the Ger
man student is more of an indi
vidualist, while the American

scholar is more integrated with
the life of the university.
One of the more exciting inci
dents he witnessed during his stay
in the United States, he said, was
the 1!)52 election.
"It was typically American—the
personal appeals of the candidates,

the speeches, the tours."
In Germany, he continued, the
election is mostly for the party,
which then elects the chancellor.
Here, though, the candidates are
j elected to a great extent on their
: personal appeal to the voter.
Asked which candidate he per
sonally favored in the American
election, Ludger indicated a pref
erence for Adlai Stevenson, a
preference which, he said, was
shared by most Europeans on the
grounds that Dwight Eisenhower
made many promises which
seemed rather impossible to ful
fill.
After staying ovetnight at the !
Kappa Sigma house Monday night,
Ludger left campus yesterday af
ternoon on his way back to Ger- (
many, where he will continue his j
i law studies at the University of j
| Bonn.
