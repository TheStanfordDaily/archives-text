# FOR AUSTRIAN CHARITY
## Lag's Annual Farm Fair Scheduled for Saturday 
### JOANNE WALKER 
Lagunita's annual Farm Fair
will be held Saturday night from
8 to 12 p.m. The purpose of the
fair is to raise money for the
needy people of the world, es
pecially those in Lagunita's Aus
trian vilage, St. Johann.
According to Lagunita files, it all j
began when "A 'primitive Orthodox' j
missionary bishop in charge of scat
tered Christians, many of them dis
placed persons, in a district of Salz
burg in Austria, managed to get to
England in June of 1947, in hope of
obtaining help—especially food and
clothes—for his people.
"He arrived ill and three parts ;
starved after a terrible existence j
since the Nazi occupation. After some
weeks he was sufficiently restored to
speak in public and ask the chari- !
table for help."
This was Bishop Timotheus of
St. Johann. While he was in Eng
land, he contacted an English
girl living at Lagunita, who became
interested in the Bishop and his
people. She arranged for Lagunita
to send them a few Care packages, j
These packages were received by
Bishop Timotheus and Sister Lore
Dutz with such gratitude, that
help was continued, expanded, and
finally culminated in the Farm
Fair.
Help is still badly needed. In Sep- i
tember 1951, when Bishop Timotheus
died, Sister Lore asked Stanford :
girls to send money to help pay for
his funeral. She did not even have
enough money for postage to send
letters to his friends informing them
of his death.
In a more recent letter, Sister
Lore wrote, "Although the shops
here are stocked with things, the
prices everywhere in Austria are
so exorbitant that even now—seven
years after the war—to buy more
than the barest necessities is next
to impossible for very many. This
is owing to the ridiculously low
wages paid for so many kinds of
work—most especially brain work.
Also high taxes sometimes force
tradesmen to dismiss hundreds of
workers at a time."
St. Johann receives most of the
money raised by the fair, but it has
been Lagunita's habit to send some
to disaster areas as it did two years
ago to the flood areas of Italy. This
year the committee wishes to send
gifts to the Korean people.
The Lagunita Farm Fair features

dancing refreshments and a number
of interesting booths. It is an all
campus affair and as Miss Crandall,
director of Lagunita, said, "We put
on the fair and do the work, but it
is still a family party. It is Stanford's
name rather than Lagunita's which
is known to the people of St. Johann,
and we hope to see both faculty and
students well represented."

help was continued, expanded, and
finally culminated in the Farm
Fair.
Help is still badly needed. In Sep- i
tember 1951, when Bishop Timotheus
died, Sister Lore asked Stanford :
girls to send money to help pay for
his funeral. She did not even have
enough money for postage to send
letters to his friends informing them
of his death.
In a more recent letter, Sister
Lore wrote, "Although the shops
here are stocked with things, the
prices everywhere in Austria are
so exorbitant that even now—seven
years after the war—to buy more
than the barest necessities is next
to impossible for very many. This
is owing to the ridiculously low
wages paid for so many kinds of
work—most especially brain work.
Also high taxes sometimes force
tradesmen to dismiss hundreds of
workers at a time."
St. Johann receives most of the
money raised by the fair, but it has
been Lagunita's habit to send some
to disaster areas as it did two years
ago to the flood areas of Italy. This
year the committee wishes to send
gifts to the Korean people.
The Lagunita Farm Fair features

dancing refreshments and a number
of interesting booths. It is an all
campus affair and as Miss Crandall,
director of Lagunita, said, "We put
on the fair and do the work, but it
is still a family party. It is Stanford's
name rather than Lagunita's which
is known to the people of St. Johann,
and we hope to see both faculty and
students well represented."
Lagunita's annual Farm Fair
will be held Saturday night from
8 to 12 p.m. The purpose of the
fair is to raise money for the
needy people of the world, es
pecially those in Lagunita's Aus
trian vilage, St. Johann.
According to Lagunita files, it all j
began when "A 'primitive Orthodox' j
missionary bishop in charge of scat
tered Christians, many of them dis
placed persons, in a district of Salz
burg in Austria, managed to get to
England in June of 1947, in hope of
obtaining help—especially food and
clothes—for his people.
"He arrived ill and three parts ;
starved after a terrible existence j
since the Nazi occupation. After some
weeks he was sufficiently restored to
speak in public and ask the chari- !
table for help."
This was Bishop Timotheus of
St. Johann. While he was in Eng
land, he contacted an English
girl living at Lagunita, who became
interested in the Bishop and his
people. She arranged for Lagunita
to send them a few Care packages, j
These packages were received by
Bishop Timotheus and Sister Lore
Dutz with such gratitude, that
help was continued, expanded, and
finally culminated in the Farm
Fair.
