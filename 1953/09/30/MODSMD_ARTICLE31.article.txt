# Stanford Slugger Displays Ability in Big League Start
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
Think you had a hard summer?
It probably doesn't compare with the activities of Jack Shepard,
ex-Stanford catcher, who played with the Denver Bears last sum
mer and caught 84 consecutive games without missing an inning.
The big receiver, named to the NCAA All-American Team, led

the Cards to a PCC championship
and a trip to Omaha for the na
tional championships. His batting
average for the season just missed
the .400 mark with a .3993 total.
His battery mate on the All-Ameri
can team was Minnesota's Paul Giel.
Shepard did not come west
after the Omaha contests, but
signed a contract with the Pitts
burgh Piratess. He joined Pitts
burgh immediately and stayed
with the club about two weeks
before he was farmed out to the
Bears in the Western League.
During his stay with the Pirates,
lie participated in two games. Now
a Biz School gradate student and
an R.A. in Encina, he tells of his
major league stay thus:
""Pittsburgh was on the road
when I joined the club. My first
game was in St. Louis against the
Cardinals, with "Vinegar Bend"
Mi/.ell pitching. I grounded out
to third base my first time up,
and singled over second the next.
The game was marred for me by
two errors I made defensively.
On the first, I hit a runner on the
thigh when I tried to pick him i
ofT second. The next, I threw so
hard trying to stop from stealing
the ball reached second before the
shortstop did."
The two throws can probably be
chalked up to nervousness, and un
der the circumstances, they were
certainly excusable.
"I was given a little mental
support in that game by Bill
Englen, who was umpiring behind
the plate that day."
"The second game I played in
was in Milwaukee's County Sta
dium. I entered the game in the
seventh, and we finally won out
in the thirteenth. Though I went
0-for-2, it was my best game, de
fensively."
A clause in Shepard's contract said
he could not be farmed out without
his permission, and after a talk with
Pirate boss Branch Rickey, he gave
his consent to be sent to Denver.
Though he was offered a number of
contract by other clubs for over the
bonus limit, he explains his signing
by saying, "If a player needs to be
farmed out, he needs to be farmed i
out. and that's all there is to it."
He arrived in Denver on the '
morning of a double-header. He
caught the first game, and let John
Albini, owned by the San Francisco
Seals, catch the second. That was
the last action Albini saw, for Shep
ard backstopped the next 84 games
withot a rest. The stint included 14 :
double-headers in which he caught 1
both ends. ,
How did he do? Well, he started
hitting in the eighth position, and

slowly moved up until he reached
the cleaiy-up spot. His final bat
ting average was .326, third high
est in the league.
He hit nine home runs and had
69 RBl's to his credit. This, even
though he joined the club in mid
season.
Shepard was also the object of
much controversy in Denver. The
first time his name appeared in
headlines was when, with two
weeks left to play in the Denver
season, he received a recall no
tice to Pittsburgh. The Bears,
only one game out of first place
and fighting for a pennant, nat
rally did not want to lose their
clean-up hitter, so Shepard de
cided to stay. He was then billed
in the newspapers as "the boy
who doesn't want to play in the
majors."
Denver finished second in league

standings, and won the first round
of the playoff series. With the sec
ond and final round about to start,
Shepard had to leave the club in
order to take his R.A. job. Need
less to say, the team was not too
happy about losing him, especially
since he had been the only receiver
they had used in close to three
months. (Denver lost their linal
playoff series game Saturday night.)
What does he plan to do now?
"Rest, sleep, and rest." No more
baseball until spring, when he re
ports to the Pittsburgh camp in
Florida. According to reports from
Rickey, he did well enough last
season that he won't be farmed out
this year, and has set as his goal
catching 70 Pirate games next sea
son.
But don't anyone show him a
baseball. He's seen enough of them
for a while.


THE BRANCHES HOPE!â€”Jack Shepard is being touted as one
of the best catching prospects now being developed in the
minor leagues. After two weeks with the Pirates where he played
inconsistently, he farmed himself out to the Denver Bears and
played in 84 consecutive games, hit .324, nine home runs and
had 69 RBl's
