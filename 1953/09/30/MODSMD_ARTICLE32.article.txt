# At Last! Browns Move to Baltimore
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Sept. 29 (UP) —The American League club owners
tonight voted to approve the transfer of the St. Louis Browns' fran
chise to Baltimore.
The vote was unanimous.
The decision reversed the stand the American League club

owners took Sunday night when
after a 10 - hour conference they
voted 4-4 against the shift. Six af
firmative votes were necessary to
transfer the franchise.
The Am er ican League also
amended its constitution to pro
vide for a 10-team league in the
event that it may want to ex
pand to the West Coast in the near
future.
Will Harridge, president of the
league, said that the Baltimore
group headed by attorney Clarence
Miles would take over 80 per cent
of the stock now held by the St.
Louis Browns' present owners.
It marked only the second time
in 50 years that a major league
franchise has been transferred to a
different city. The other one was
last spring when the Boston Braves
shifted their National League fran
chise to Milwaukee. The Braves,
who finished second to the pennant
winning Brooklyn Dodgers, set a
new all-time National League at
tendance record in their first sea
son in the Wisconsin city.
The Baltimore interests take over
all the St. Louis Browns' players,
the contract of Manager Marty Mar
ion, which runs through 1954, and
the contract of Farm Supervisor
Bill DeWitt, which has two more
years to run-.
"This is a great day for Balti
more," Del Webb said. "If the
people in California had worked •

as hard as the people in Balti
more, they -would have had the
club there. This is a great dem
onstration of what can be done.
I'm going to put the people out
there to work in the same way."
