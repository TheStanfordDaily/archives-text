# Varsity Scrimmages Taper Off In Preparation for Illini Tilt
## 
### 
With the Rose Bowl defeat vivid
in their minds, Chuck Taylor put
his fired-up gridders through a light
contact practice yesterday. Taylor
announced that he wouldn't scrim
mage the squad this week, in order
to keep everyone healthy for Illi
nois.
Norm Manoogian is all padded up
and i?eady to go as is the rest of the
squad with the exception of the
pre-season injured Dick Monteith,
who was running laps yesterday.
The Indians concentrated on per
fecting their pass patterns, while tht?

linemen worked on plays. Bob Gar
rett didn't participate in the passing
drill because ol a blister on his right
thumb, but he'll be set for Satur
day.
Fight of the week, position-wise,
is between Sam Morley and Marv
Tennefoss lor the right end spot.
Tennefoss, with his sterling defen
sive play in the Oregon game, may
get the starting assignment against
the Illini.
