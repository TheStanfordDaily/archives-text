# New Lights In Main Libe
## 
### 
New fluorescent lights have been !
installed in the main reading room |
of the library at a cost of close to j
$26,000.
For several years there have been
complaints of poor visibility at table j
level in the room. A thorough study
of the situation revealed the type
of lighting fixtures that should be |
used.
The problem of installing new
lights was a difficult one for several
reasons. An extremely high ceiling
in the room made it necessary to
have extra-strong lights. However, 1
University oflieials did not want the j
kind of fluorescent lights that hum,
for it would disturb the study of
the .students. Also, they didn't want,
the reading room to look, as Assist
ant Business Manager S. F. Post
put it, "like a factory."
Though the lighting problem is \
now solved, several others still ex
ist. The primary one is a glare
which comes from a reflection off
the Hoover Tower. Special draping
will soon be installed to solve this
problem.
