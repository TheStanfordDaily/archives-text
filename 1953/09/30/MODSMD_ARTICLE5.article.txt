## 
### 
WASHINGTON —Defense Secre
tary Charles E. Wilson said today
there is "every reason to believe"
the United States leads Russia in
all military fields and reported the
U.S. Air Force may reach 120 wings
12 months ahead of schedule.
Wilson gave this optimistic pic
ture at a news conference at which
he cautioned against "becoming
panicky" over Russian military
might.
But he also cautioned against
"complacency." He said there al
ways is danger some spark could
set off a war, but that "I doubt very
much that the Russians have any
policy of starting a war at the pres
ent time."
Wilson also said defense spending
may be cut about five per cent next
fiscal year but that he does not know
whether this will permit a balanced
budget.
The Defense Secretary also tended
to discount rumors the government
plans to give the public more infor
mation on American atomic weap
ons.
He said publicizing the number of
A-bombs the United States has
would "not help our country." Such
a figure would be meaningless, he
added, without giving the size of
the weapons, the planes that can
drop them, and the targets on which
they would be dropped.
