Alpha Phi Omega's Book Ex
change, which got off to a fast start
during registration, v/ill remain
open today and tomorrow from 9
a.m. to noon and from 1 to 4 p.m.
to help students sell their old text
books.
In the first two days of the sale,
the service fraternity has sold al
most 200 books for their owners,
and about 120 books remain on the
shelves this morning.
A Phi O took in $314.07 in sales
today. Almost all this money will
be returned to students when their
books are exchanged.
Books especially in demand are
texts for Western Civ, freshman
English, chemistry, and physics. A
Phi O spokesmen suggest that stu
dents wishing to sell books being
used in these courses this quarter
bring them to the exchange prompt
ly-
The Exchange will reopen on Oct.
22, 23, and 24 to return money or
unsold books. In past, years, many
students have neglected to collect
their money or' books, which then
revert to A Phi O's service fund.
This year, each student placing
books with the exchange fills out a
postcard to be mailed to him when
the exchange reopens.
The Exchange is located in Main
Libe Room 106, at the rear of the
first floor. Students who place their
books with the Exchange set their
own prices for the books, and pay
a small service charge.
