# Political Union Plans Program
## 
### 
A student-faculty meeting will be
held at 4:30 this afternoon in the
Bowman Alumni Clubhouse for
those interested in helping to draw
up plans for the establishment of a
Stanford Political Union proposed
last year.
Students from all classes are in
vited to attend. Temporary party
chairmen and other officers of the
Executive Board of the Union are
still needed.
The purpose of the Union is to
present a program of education on
political issues, since partisan politi
cal activity is barred from campus.
Program plans for this fall include
an organizational meeting at Cub
berley on Oct,. 15 and three regular
meetings where prominent political
figures will speak.
