# Browns Return To Major League
## 
### 
BALTIMORE, Sept. 29 (UP) —
Baltimore jubilantly welcomed the
news tonight that it is back in the
major leagues.
"It's about time," was the general
reaction of the fans, many of whom
had threatened "never to see an
other baseball game" after the
American League owners rejected
the transfer of the St. Louis Browns
Sunday.
That was all forgotten tonight in a
wave of wild enthusiasm as news
papers and radio stations blared the
news that the Browns—to be re
named the Orioles—will play here
next season.
There was immediately talk of a
pennant, something the lowly
Browns haven't been in hailing dis
tance of for years, and a new at
tendance mark surpassing that set
this season by the surprising Mil
waukee Braves of the National
League.
