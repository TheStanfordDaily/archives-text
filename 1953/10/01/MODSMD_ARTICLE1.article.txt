# PALO ALTO TO ANNEX 266 FARM ACRES?
## Stanford Requests Move; Traffic Plans Disclosed 
### 
Stanford has asked the City of Palo Alto to annex 266 acres of
University land, including the site where Stanford intends to
build a $15,000,000 shopping center.
The announcement by President Wallace Sterling made known
for the first time the University's plans for professional and

multiple housing tracts along or near
San Francisquito Creek in back of
the shopping center.
A proposed route for the extension
of Willow Road through the campus
and other traffic plans were also dis
closed.
A petition requesting annexation
and zoning was filed with Ihe Palo
Alto city clerk yesterday afternoon
by Alf E. Brandin, Stanford's execu
tive officer for land development.
Time needed for zoning commis
sion hearings, for publication of legal
notices, and for other requirements
means that the proposal probably
will not be ready for discussion at a
city council meeting for six to eight
weeks, according to Jerry Keithley,
Palo Alto city manager.
The six areas under considera
tion are:
1. Eighty-three acres between
Palo Alto Hospital and San Fran
cisquito Creek where construction
of the regional shopping center is
scheduled to begin about April 1,
1954.
2. A professional and adminis
trate ollice site, 42 acres directly
behind the shopping center.
3. A residential apartment area, 83
acres in a long strip beginning be
hind the Stanford Convalescent
Home and running between the pro
posed extension of Willow Road and
the creek bank.
4. The Palo Alto Hospital grounds,
10 acres.
5. The Convalescent Home area
of about 2(» acres, which the Home
leases from Stanford.
(5. A strip of about 22 acres be
hind the already-annexed piece of
University land in South Palo Alto
in which Varian Associates and
Eastman Kodak hold leases.
The University is also requesting
final zoning for parts of this South
Palo Alto section. With the proposed
22 additional acres, the area covers
about 200 acres, bounded by El Ca
mino Real, Barron Park, California
Avenue and an extension of Dart
mouth Avenue.
A strip along California Avenue
is now zoned PC, a holding desig
nation for land on which the city has

ford is requesting light industrial
classification for this area, the same
as the zoning of the University's
adjoining land.
Landscaped ''green belts" are to
be maintained on University prop
erty along California Avenue and
along the Barron Park boundary,
according to Brandin. As in the
case of the Varian and Eastman
leases, Stanford would maintain

strict requirements for clean, light
manufacturing, landscaped prem
ises and off-street parking, Bran
din stated.
Stanford is also requesting com
mercial zoning for a 300-foot-deep
strip along El Camino Real between
Hansen Way and California Avenue,
excepting for one parcel not owned
by Stanford and for the Mayfield
elementary school grounds, which
Stanford leases to the Palo Alto
school district.

The El Camino frontage from Han
sen Way to Barron Park is already
zoned commercial to n depth of 200
feet, where the Varian lease takes
up.
The proposed route for the ex
tension of Willow Road through i
the campus begins on El Camino
Ileal near the Sail Francisquito
Creek bridge, veers southward
around the edge of the Convales
cent Home grounds and then fol
lows a straight line to connect with
Sand llill Itoad.
A new road would branch at right
angles from Willow through Stan
ford property approximately at the
rear of the shopping center site. It
would intersect Palm Drive and join
Galvez Street near the stadium.
"The Willow Road development
will be vitally important in three
ways," Brandin declared. "It will
service the shopping center, it will
handle the gTeatly increased flow
of traffic from Alpine and Sand Hill
roads that is now going through the
heart of the campus, and it will be
a link in the cross-Peninsula de
velopment of Willow."
It is also proposed to extend Han
sen Way into the center of the light
manufacturing area, where it would
turn to the right and connect with
Page Mill Road.

strip along El Camino Real between
Hansen Way and California Avenue,
excepting for one parcel not owned
by Stanford and for the Mayfield
elementary school grounds, which
Stanford leases to the Palo Alto
school district.

The El Camino frontage from Han

zoned commercial to n depth of 200
feet, where the Varian lease takes
up.
The proposed route for the ex
tension of Willow Road through i
the campus begins on El Camino
Ileal near the Sail Francisquito
Creek bridge, veers southward
around the edge of the Convales
cent Home grounds and then fol
lows a straight line to connect with
Sand llill Itoad.
A new road would branch at right
angles from Willow through Stan
ford property approximately at the
rear of the shopping center site. It
would intersect Palm Drive and join
Galvez Street near the stadium.
"The Willow Road development
will be vitally important in three
ways," Brandin declared. "It will
service the shopping center, it will
handle the gTeatly increased flow
of traffic from Alpine and Sand Hill
roads that is now going through the
heart of the campus, and it will be
a link in the cross-Peninsula de
velopment of Willow."
It is also proposed to extend Han

Stanford has asked the City of Palo Alto to annex 266 acres of
University land, including the site where Stanford intends to
build a $15,000,000 shopping center.
The announcement by President Wallace Sterling made known
for the first time the University's plans for professional and

multiple housing tracts along or near
San Francisquito Creek in back of
the shopping center.
A proposed route for the extension
of Willow Road through the campus
and other traffic plans were also dis
closed.
A petition requesting annexation
and zoning was filed with Ihe Palo
Alto city clerk yesterday afternoon
by Alf E. Brandin, Stanford's execu
tive officer for land development.
Time needed for zoning commis
sion hearings, for publication of legal
notices, and for other requirements
means that the proposal probably
will not be ready for discussion at a
city council meeting for six to eight
weeks, according to Jerry Keithley,
Palo Alto city manager.
The six areas under considera
tion are:
1. Eighty-three acres between
Palo Alto Hospital and San Fran
cisquito Creek where construction
of the regional shopping center is
scheduled to begin about April 1,
1954.
2. A professional and adminis
trate ollice site, 42 acres directly
behind the shopping center.
3. A residential apartment area, 83
acres in a long strip beginning be

the back 22 acres of the limited industrial area shown at the left. The remainder of the limited
industrial area and its commercial frontage along El Camino Real have already been annexed

not yet made a zone decision. Stan
ford is requesting light industrial
classification for this area, the same
as the zoning of the University's
adjoining land.
Landscaped ''green belts" are to
be maintained on University prop
erty along California Avenue and
along the Barron Park boundary,
according to Brandin. As in the
case of the Varian and Eastman
leases, Stanford would maintain

strict requirements for clean, light
manufacturing, landscaped prem
ises and off-street parking, Bran
din stated.
Stanford is also requesting com
mercial zoning for a 300-foot-deep
strip along El Camino Real between
Hansen Way and California Avenue,
excepting for one parcel not owned
by Stanford and for the Mayfield
elementary school grounds, which
Stanford leases to the Palo Alto
school district.

The El Camino frontage from Han
sen Way to Barron Park is already
zoned commercial to n depth of 200
feet, where the Varian lease takes
up.
The proposed route for the ex
tension of Willow Road through i
the campus begins on El Camino
Ileal near the Sail Francisquito
Creek bridge, veers southward
around the edge of the Convales
cent Home grounds and then fol
lows a straight line to connect with
Sand llill Itoad.
A new road would branch at right
angles from Willow through Stan
ford property approximately at the
rear of the shopping center site. It
would intersect Palm Drive and join
Galvez Street near the stadium.
"The Willow Road development
will be vitally important in three
ways," Brandin declared. "It will
service the shopping center, it will
handle the gTeatly increased flow
of traffic from Alpine and Sand Hill
roads that is now going through the
heart of the campus, and it will be
a link in the cross-Peninsula de
velopment of Willow."
It is also proposed to extend Han
sen Way into the center of the light
manufacturing area, where it would
turn to the right and connect with
Page Mill Road.
Stanford has asked the City of Palo Alto to annex 266 acres of
University land, including the site where Stanford intends to
build a $15,000,000 shopping center.
The announcement by President Wallace Sterling made known
for the first time the University's plans for professional and

multiple housing tracts along or near
San Francisquito Creek in back of
the shopping center.
A proposed route for the extension
of Willow Road through the campus
and other traffic plans were also dis
closed.
A petition requesting annexation
and zoning was filed with Ihe Palo
Alto city clerk yesterday afternoon
by Alf E. Brandin, Stanford's execu
tive officer for land development.
Time needed for zoning commis
sion hearings, for publication of legal
notices, and for other requirements
means that the proposal probably
will not be ready for discussion at a
city council meeting for six to eight
weeks, according to Jerry Keithley,
Palo Alto city manager.
The six areas under considera
tion are:
1. Eighty-three acres between
Palo Alto Hospital and San Fran
cisquito Creek where construction
of the regional shopping center is
scheduled to begin about April 1,
1954.
2. A professional and adminis
trate ollice site, 42 acres directly
behind the shopping center.
3. A residential apartment area, 83
acres in a long strip beginning be
hind the Stanford Convalescent
Home and running between the pro
posed extension of Willow Road and
the creek bank.
4. The Palo Alto Hospital grounds,
10 acres.
5. The Convalescent Home area
of about 2(» acres, which the Home
leases from Stanford.
