# PALO ALTO TO ANNEX 266 FARM ACRES?
## Stanford Requests Move; Traffic Plans Disclosed 
### 
Stanford has asked the City of Palo Alto to annex 266 acres of
University land, including the site where Stanford intends to
build a $15,000,000 shopping center.
The announcement by President Wallace Sterling made known
for the first time the University's plans for professional and

multiple housing tracts along or near
San Francisquito Creek in back of
the shopping center.
A proposed route for the extension
of Willow Road through the campus
and other traffic plans were also dis
closed.
A petition requesting annexation
and zoning was filed with Ihe Palo
Alto city clerk yesterday afternoon
by Alf E. Brandin, Stanford's execu
tive officer for land development.
Time needed for zoning commis
sion hearings, for publication of legal
notices, and for other requirements
means that the proposal probably
will not be ready for discussion at a
city council meeting for six to eight
weeks, according to Jerry Keithley,
Palo Alto city manager.
The six areas under considera
tion are:
1. Eighty-three acres between
Palo Alto Hospital and San Fran
cisquito Creek where construction
of the regional shopping center is
scheduled to begin about April 1,
1954.
2. A professional and adminis
trate ollice site, 42 acres directly
behind the shopping center.
3. A residential apartment area, 83
acres in a long strip beginning be
hind the Stanford Convalescent
Home and running between the pro
posed extension of Willow Road and
the creek bank.
4. The Palo Alto Hospital grounds,
10 acres.
5. The Convalescent Home area
of about 2(» acres, which the Home
leases from Stanford.
(5. A strip of about 22 acres be
hind the already-annexed piece of
University land in South Palo Alto
in which Varian Associates and
Eastman Kodak hold leases.
The University is also requesting
final zoning for parts of this South
Palo Alto section. With the proposed
22 additional acres, the area covers
about 200 acres, bounded by El Ca
mino Real, Barron Park, California
Avenue and an extension of Dart
mouth Avenue.
A strip along California Avenue
is now zoned PC, a holding desig
nation for land on which the city has


STANFORD UNIVERSITY—Map of the areas, totalling 266 acres, which Stanford has asked
the City of Palo Alto to annex. The proposal includes the three (3) shaded areas near San Fran
cisquito Creek, grounds of the Palo Alto Hospital and of the Stanford Convalescent Home, and
the back 22 acres of the limited industrial area shown at the left. The remainder of the limited
industrial area and its commercial frontage along El Camino Real have already been annexed
to Palo Alto. The commercial area near San Francisquito Creek is where the University plans
to build a $15,000,000 shopping center.
