NEW YORK. Sept. :;o—Lewis L.
Strauss, chairman of the Atomic
Energy Commission, said tonight
I that U.S. atomic information was
given recently to a technician of an
allied nation who was later found
"to have been working for the So
viets."
Strauss cited the case as "one of

the troublesome aspects" involved
in fuller co-operation on atomic
matters "with some friendly nations
whose security checks on their
technicians may not be as thorough
as our own."
Strauss did not name the techni
cian, the country by whom he was
employed, or the "material" he was
given.
Presumably the information was
not secret weapons information,
however, since under this country's
atomic law such data cannot be
given even to U.S. allies.
