# The
						Daily—Your Paper
## 
### 
The Daily, this coming year, will strive to be
YOUR paper, reflecting your opinions, your
inquiries, your actions.
It hopes to cover all significant campus ac
tivities as well as report all that is important
nationally and internationally.
That, it might seem, is a big order, but one
wo feel confident we can meet, providing, of
» ourse, we have your help.
As we have said, the paper is YOUR paper,
written particularly for you.
Consequently, we must be constantly ap
prised of your thoughts and ideas. That is why
Thje Daily each year—and particularly this
year extends an invitation to you to partici
pate in the writing of the paper by voicing
opinions in the Letters to the Editor column.
Perhaps one of the better read features of
.111 y newspaper, the Letters are an avenue by
which opinion, regardless of shade or charac
teristic, can be expressed.
There are some restrictions, however. Chief
one is that of space. Ke&p your letters short
rilid to the point.
Also, to protect yourself, guard against care
less statement.
The in reporting each day's news,
sincerely will attempt to be fair and impartial.
We will try to give all sides to issues re
ported. However, we will not be reluctant to
take an editorial stand when we think the
need demands.
In reporting the current news, we will try
to meet the many requests for special stories
and pictures and page one boxes that inevita
bly flow into the Shack.

And though we fully appreciate the publicity
problems of the various clubs and activities,
we must reserve the strict right to use the
black pencil and the scissors.
The Daily — with its usual four, much too
easily-filled pages— must attempt to select
those stories that comand the widest campus
interest. That is why many stories from the
United Press wires on national and interna
tional affairs will most likely merit favored
page one play as opposed to the report of a
meeting with a membership of 25.
It's a difficult problem to decide, on news
coverage and newsplay, but, and this we can
assure you, we will try to be as fair as is pos
sible on a small paper.
As far as editorial policy is concerned, we
envisage no startling change over past years,
with moderation in editorial temperament the
*joal.
We will not try to change the world or lead
the students on a crusade. (Not that we could,
anyway.) We will, however, try to keep them
posted on what happens on campus and else
where.
The Daily, we pledge, will try to hold the
interests of the students in mind each day when
it sets about its routine of copy reading and
headline writing.
If we ever falter in properly interpreting that
interest, then let us know, for the columns of
The Daily, YOUR newspaper, are always open
to you. So is the red door of the Shack.
The Shack is located on Lomita Drive next to
the Press Building. Mailing address is simply
"Stanford Daily."
