# Douglas' 'Robe'—A Pagan Treatment Of a Christian Theme—Opens in S.F.
## 
### SUE WHEAT Managing Editor, The Daily 
The Robe," in all its cinemascopic, stereophonic
glory, opened in San Francisco's Fox Theater Tuesday
night, bringing to the expectant premiere audience
a film little different from any of Hollywood's other
$4.5 million extravaganzas.
Technically, the first experiment in cinemascope—a
process requiring a giant screen three times the size
of a normal one—was a success. The extra width

permits expansive color panoramas
and adds to the realistic appear
ance of the actors. Add to this,
vtereoscopic sound which seems to
emanate directly from the mouth
of the character speaking, throw
in a three-dimensional effect be-J
ides, and you have an audience

fas the billboards claim) literally "engulfed." Like
television, it has a hypnotic appeal. Whether it's
worth watching or not is a different matter.
While the screen adaptation from Lloyd C. Doug
las' novel. 'The Kobe," was fairly accurate and
well edited. Henry Koster's directing did little to
enhance the production.
Victor Mature cut a convincing figure of a proud
Crer.k slave. But his gross overacting labeled him
the most Hollywoodish touch of all. He seemed to be
constantly xonscious of his bronzed physique as he
posed, leaped, and even twisted on the proverbial
torture tack.
Richard Burton, a newcomer to filmland, turned

in a good job as the hero Marcellus. Jean Simmons
as his lover supplied the necessary female role—and
not much else'.
The most disturbing element of the movie is a
basic one. And it is this. The novel "The Robe,"
while it does not pretend to be any accurate popu
larization of the New Testament, does have a thor
oughly religious theme in which the divinity of
Christ is assumed, though illustrated through hu
man treatment. The film's directors, while never
for a moment questioning the assumption of the
book, choose to give its theme their usual pagan
treatment.
Perhaps our feeling at seeing a dramatization of
the crucifixion in technicolor could be compared to
a staid Britisher who, remembering the days of
Queen Victoria, balks at watching the coronation
of Elizabeth on a 12-inch TV screen. The over
popularized treatment of the Christian theme is
epitomized when Christ is made to utter his dying
words from the cross. This was poor from a dramatic
viewpoint, if from no other, since the thin, erudite
voice shattered one's personal illusion as to what
Christ's voice would really have sounded like.
The movie, as a novelty, is probably worth seeing.
Its inferior content is magnificently presented.
Perhaps when portions of the million-dollar movie
budgets are allotted to the securing of good actors
and directors we will be able to praise both content
and presentation.

The Robe," in all its cinemascopic, stereophonic
glory, opened in San Francisco's Fox Theater Tuesday
night, bringing to the expectant premiere audience
a film little different from any of Hollywood's other
$4.5 million extravaganzas.
Technically, the first experiment in cinemascope—a
process requiring a giant screen three times the size
of a normal one—was a success. The extra width

permits expansive color panoramas
and adds to the realistic appear
ance of the actors. Add to this,
vtereoscopic sound which seems to
emanate directly from the mouth
of the character speaking, throw
in a three-dimensional effect be-J
ides, and you have an audience

fas the billboards claim) literally "engulfed." Like
television, it has a hypnotic appeal. Whether it's
worth watching or not is a different matter.
While the screen adaptation from Lloyd C. Doug
las' novel. 'The Kobe," was fairly accurate and
well edited. Henry Koster's directing did little to
enhance the production.
Victor Mature cut a convincing figure of a proud
Crer.k slave. But his gross overacting labeled him
the most Hollywoodish touch of all. He seemed to be
constantly xonscious of his bronzed physique as he
posed, leaped, and even twisted on the proverbial
torture tack.
Richard Burton, a newcomer to filmland, turned

in a good job as the hero Marcellus. Jean Simmons
as his lover supplied the necessary female role—and
not much else'.
The most disturbing element of the movie is a
basic one. And it is this. The novel "The Robe,"
while it does not pretend to be any accurate popu
larization of the New Testament, does have a thor
oughly religious theme in which the divinity of
Christ is assumed, though illustrated through hu
man treatment. The film's directors, while never
for a moment questioning the assumption of the
book, choose to give its theme their usual pagan
treatment.
Perhaps our feeling at seeing a dramatization of
the crucifixion in technicolor could be compared to
a staid Britisher who, remembering the days of
Queen Victoria, balks at watching the coronation
of Elizabeth on a 12-inch TV screen. The over
popularized treatment of the Christian theme is
epitomized when Christ is made to utter his dying
words from the cross. This was poor from a dramatic
viewpoint, if from no other, since the thin, erudite
voice shattered one's personal illusion as to what
Christ's voice would really have sounded like.
The movie, as a novelty, is probably worth seeing.
Its inferior content is magnificently presented.
