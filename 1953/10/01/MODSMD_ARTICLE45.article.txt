# Illinois Hopes to Duplicate ’52 Rose Bowl Massacre
## 
### RUSS WILKS 
Illinois football coach Ray Eliot puts a seven game unbeaten
streak on the line this Saturday when his Fighting Illini enter
tdin Stanford at Memorial Stadium in Champaign Urbana.
Eliot's club has never lost a game to a Pacific Coast team. Thrice 1
his gridders have taken the measure of UCLA and Washington,

and then there was the Rose Bowl
tussle with Stanford in 1952 in
which Johnny Karris, Tommy
O'Cormell, Bill Tate, and crew rolled
up a 40-7 score.
This year, however, only ten
men are left from the Bowl squad
and all the big guns are gone.
Flint is therefore worried that the
lirsl defeat may he coming up
shortly.
Illinois finished in a three-way
tic for sixth last year and is picked
lor the fifth spot this year in the
Hit l Ten. The team could surprise

I lie experts, however, as Eliot has
W> lettermen back.
Stanford line coach Dutch Fehr- j
iiij l scouted the Ulini in their 21-21 I
game against Nebraska lust Satur
day and reported that Illinois was
a green ball club, but was full of
potential.
Most of this potential rests with
die hackfield. Eliot has a dozen fast
backs and the cream of the crop
seems to be J. C. Caroline, a half
back fiom Columbia, S.C. Against
Nebraska, Caroline made two se
i ions errors, but turned from goat
to hero with a dazzling fourth-quar
ter 73-yard touchdown run which
parked the Illinois comeback.
At the other half is sophomore
Mickey Bates, who plunged for
die lying tougchdown last week.
Ken Miller, who added all three
extra points against the Corn
lui.skers, will work at fullback
and will also handle the punt
ing chores.
Calling the.plays from the T-for
mation will be Ed Lindbeck, who
had to beat out veterans Bob Gon
gola and Elry Falkenstein for the
job. Lindbeck last week completed
eight out of 15 passes. He con
nected with end Cliff Waldbesser
for a touchdown. Rocky Ryan, the
other end, has filled the shoes of the
graduated sensational pass-catching
Hex Smith. Last season Ryan snag
ged 45 passes for 714 yards.
Captain Bob Lenzini, who was
All-Big Ten, will be at one tackle
and either Rog Wolf or Dick Miller,
defensive platooners a year ago, will
hold down the other tackle spot.
The middle of the Illini line seems
lo be the weak spot despite the fact
that lettermen Don Tate and Jan
Sinid arc at guards. Letterman Herb
Bornman or West Point transfer
Jack Chamblin will start at center.
Neither Stan Wallace, whose
third-quarter pass interception in
the Rose Bowl game turned the j
tide of battle, nor Hud DeMoss, j
who streaked 45 yards in the '

Howl game, will l>»- in the open
ing lineup.
Against Nebraska Illinois relied
on its ground game as it registered
19 first downs, grounding out 290
yards, while passing for 72 yards.
Eliot put his team through a full
scrimmage yesterday and Tuesday.
His squad came out of Saturday's
game without an injury. It's not
the same Rose Bowl team, but it
will be tough.
Meanwhile, Chuck Taylor con
tinued late, but no contact work
outs. He ran his gridders against
Illinois plays, and for the first time
this season the lights were turned
on. Bill Wentworth has been in
stalled at fullback and sophomore
Ernie Dorn has been injected in the
right halfback slot replacing Jarvis
Watson and Bill Rogers, respec
tively.
The team was scheduled to
work out this morning anil will
fly to Chicago via United Air
lines. They will arrive at dinner
time and later fly to Champaign-
Urbana. Game time Saturday is
2 p.m. CST (12 noon PST).
Following are the 37 players and
staff making the trip to Illinois:
Ends: John Steinberg, Sam Mor
ley, Marv Tennel'oss, John Stewart,
Ron Bush, Bill Scheidecker; tackles:
Matt Armitage, Barry Smith, John

—Illini captain
Illinois football coach Ray Eliot puts a seven game unbeaten
streak on the line this Saturday when his Fighting Illini enter
tdin Stanford at Memorial Stadium in Champaign Urbana.
Eliot's club has never lost a game to a Pacific Coast team. Thrice 1
his gridders have taken the measure of UCLA and Washington,

and then there was the Rose Bowl
tussle with Stanford in 1952 in
which Johnny Karris, Tommy
O'Cormell, Bill Tate, and crew rolled
up a 40-7 score.
This year, however, only ten
men are left from the Bowl squad
and all the big guns are gone.
Flint is therefore worried that the
lirsl defeat may he coming up
shortly.
Illinois finished in a three-way
tic for sixth last year and is picked
lor the fifth spot this year in the
Hit l Ten. The team could surprise

I lie experts, however, as Eliot has
W> lettermen back.
Stanford line coach Dutch Fehr- j
iiij l scouted the Ulini in their 21-21 I
game against Nebraska lust Satur
day and reported that Illinois was
a green ball club, but was full of
potential.
Most of this potential rests with
die hackfield. Eliot has a dozen fast
backs and the cream of the crop
seems to be J. C. Caroline, a half
back fiom Columbia, S.C. Against
Nebraska, Caroline made two se
i ions errors, but turned from goat
to hero with a dazzling fourth-quar
ter 73-yard touchdown run which
parked the Illinois comeback.
At the other half is sophomore
Mickey Bates, who plunged for
die lying tougchdown last week.
Ken Miller, who added all three
extra points against the Corn
lui.skers, will work at fullback
and will also handle the punt
ing chores.
Calling the.plays from the T-for
mation will be Ed Lindbeck, who
had to beat out veterans Bob Gon
gola and Elry Falkenstein for the
job. Lindbeck last week completed
eight out of 15 passes. He con
nected with end Cliff Waldbesser
for a touchdown. Rocky Ryan, the
other end, has filled the shoes of the
graduated sensational pass-catching
Hex Smith. Last season Ryan snag
ged 45 passes for 714 yards.
Captain Bob Lenzini, who was
All-Big Ten, will be at one tackle
and either Rog Wolf or Dick Miller,
defensive platooners a year ago, will
hold down the other tackle spot.
The middle of the Illini line seems
lo be the weak spot despite the fact
that lettermen Don Tate and Jan
Sinid arc at guards. Letterman Herb
Bornman or West Point transfer
Jack Chamblin will start at center.
Neither Stan Wallace, whose
third-quarter pass interception in
the Rose Bowl game turned the j
tide of battle, nor Hud DeMoss, j
who streaked 45 yards in the '

Howl game, will l>»- in the open
ing lineup.

seems to be J. C. Caroline, a half
back fiom Columbia, S.C. Against
Nebraska, Caroline made two se
i ions errors, but turned from goat
to hero with a dazzling fourth-quar
ter 73-yard touchdown run which
parked the Illinois comeback.
At the other half is sophomore
Mickey Bates, who plunged for
die lying tougchdown last week.
Ken Miller, who added all three
extra points against the Corn
lui.skers, will work at fullback
and will also handle the punt
ing chores.
Calling the.plays from the T-for
mation will be Ed Lindbeck, who
had to beat out veterans Bob Gon
gola and Elry Falkenstein for the
job. Lindbeck last week completed
eight out of 15 passes. He con
nected with end Cliff Waldbesser
for a touchdown. Rocky Ryan, the
other end, has filled the shoes of the
graduated sensational pass-catching
Hex Smith. Last season Ryan snag
ged 45 passes for 714 yards.
Captain Bob Lenzini, who was
All-Big Ten, will be at one tackle
and either Rog Wolf or Dick Miller,
defensive platooners a year ago, will
hold down the other tackle spot.
The middle of the Illini line seems
lo be the weak spot despite the fact
that lettermen Don Tate and Jan
Sinid arc at guards. Letterman Herb
Bornman or West Point transfer
Jack Chamblin will start at center.
Neither Stan Wallace, whose
third-quarter pass interception in
the Rose Bowl game turned the j
tide of battle, nor Hud DeMoss, j
who streaked 45 yards in the '

Howl game, will l>»- in the open
ing lineup.
Against Nebraska Illinois relied
on its ground game as it registered
19 first downs, grounding out 290
yards, while passing for 72 yards.
Eliot put his team through a full
scrimmage yesterday and Tuesday.
His squad came out of Saturday's
game without an injury. It's not
the same Rose Bowl team, but it
will be tough.
Meanwhile, Chuck Taylor con
tinued late, but no contact work
outs. He ran his gridders against
Illinois plays, and for the first time
this season the lights were turned
on. Bill Wentworth has been in
stalled at fullback and sophomore
Ernie Dorn has been injected in the
right halfback slot replacing Jarvis
Watson and Bill Rogers, respec
tively.
The team was scheduled to
work out this morning anil will
fly to Chicago via United Air
lines. They will arrive at dinner
time and later fly to Champaign-
Urbana. Game time Saturday is
2 p.m. CST (12 noon PST).

Illinois football coach Ray Eliot puts a seven game unbeaten
streak on the line this Saturday when his Fighting Illini enter
tdin Stanford at Memorial Stadium in Champaign Urbana.
Eliot's club has never lost a game to a Pacific Coast team. Thrice 1
his gridders have taken the measure of UCLA and Washington,

and then there was the Rose Bowl
tussle with Stanford in 1952 in
which Johnny Karris, Tommy
O'Cormell, Bill Tate, and crew rolled
up a 40-7 score.
This year, however, only ten
men are left from the Bowl squad
and all the big guns are gone.
Flint is therefore worried that the
lirsl defeat may he coming up
shortly.
Illinois finished in a three-way
tic for sixth last year and is picked
lor the fifth spot this year in the
Hit l Ten. The team could surprise

I lie experts, however, as Eliot has
W> lettermen back.
Stanford line coach Dutch Fehr- j
iiij l scouted the Ulini in their 21-21 I
game against Nebraska lust Satur
day and reported that Illinois was
a green ball club, but was full of
potential.
