### 
Fifty-six hopeful frosh, including
j some of last year's highly touted
j preps, signed up with Coach Bob
Ghilotti for the five-week freshman
football season.
Under a new PCC ruling, only
j two games may be scheduled for
freshman teams during those five
weeks. The Papooses will see their
only action in a home-and-home
set with California.
Featured among the Hay Area
gridders who have reported to
Ghilotti is svvifty Gordon Young
from San Francisco Poly. Young
broke Ollie Matson's city scoring
record last year, but his small
stature (5-9, 1(J5) may hamper
him in college ranks.
Paul Camera of St. Ignatius, sec
ond string on the All-City team,
may turn out to be the frosh's top
quarterback. Other promising backs
include Jim Noe of University High
in Los Angeles, Monrovia's Jack
Groat, who was one of the top three
prep sprinters in Southern Califor
nia last spring, and Mike Raftery
of Ingle wood.
From Hill School, Potsdam, Pa.,
come a pair of fleet halfbacks, Ray
Miller and Duff Bigger, and guard
Tony Williams.
Leading candidates for starting
line berths are All-Nevada guard
Don Manoukian from Reno; All-
City center Ed Mi/.rahi of Horsey
in l.os Angeles; and Fscondido's
