pat, will match slow stuff as the
Dodgers attempt to square the Se
ries. Game time is 10 a.m. Pacific
time, with KRON televising the
contest.
In yesterday's opener, Yanks
Joe Collins and John Sain led a
late-inning surge as the Bombers
scored an impressive !) to 5 win.
The Yanks opened right up on
j 20-game winner Carl Erskine. Er
[ skine's fast b;jll was taking otf and
| the resulting carnage included three
walks and triples by Hank Bauer
and Billy Martin as the Yanks
knocked Erskine out with a four
run barrage in the first. They added
another in the fifth as Yogi Berra
homered.
Meanwhile, Dodgers Junior Gil
liam, George Shuba, and Gil Hodges
homered off Allie Reynolds, who
failed in his attempt for a record
tying seventh Series win. Hodges'

came with one man on.
The Dodgers pushed over a run
in the seventh, but two brilliant
plays by Berra kept the Bums
j from taking the lead.

Collins homered in the seventh
and Sain bombed ;i long double in
the eighth to spai k a three - run
