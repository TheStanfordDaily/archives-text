## Committee To Study Honor Code 
### BOB REZAK Associate Editor, The Daily 
The Executive Comittee in its
first meeting of the quarter last
night approved a motion to ap
point a special subcommittee to
work with the faculty in finding
a solution to questions concern
ing a possible revision in the
Honor Code.
The motion, unanimously ap
proved by Excom members, speci
fied that the special committee be
composed of members of the Funda
mental Standard Committee, the
Academic Council, Council for Stu
dent Control, and Excom.
John Stahr, student manager,
amended the motion, With the ap
proval of Excom, calling for the ap
pointment of a preliminary com
mittee of meet with the Student
Affairs Committee of the Academic
Council to decide on the questions
to be discussed by the special sub
committee.
Members of both the special
subcommittee and the preliminary
committee arc expected to be ap
pointed at a future Excom meet
ing.
Stahr said the current problem
over the Honor Code—whether or
not students should be allowed to
take examinations out of the class
room—was presented at a meeting
of the Summer Excom by Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler and
Professor Raymond Harriman of the
Department of Classics.
At that meeting, and in subse
quent talks with Dean Winbigler,
Stahr said the Dean reported that
within the past year some profes
sors expressed concern to the
Dean that increasing numbers of
students were taking examina
tions out of class.
The current Honor Code issue
stemmed from these reports, Stahr
said.
As yet, there is no eomon agree
ment among the faculty on the ques
tion.
In a meeting last week with
ASSU President Don Lo/.abnick,
ASSU Vice President Jeannie
Bobis, Daily Editor Hadlcy Roff,
and Stahr, Dean Winbigler agreed
with the student leaders that stu
dents and faculty members should
work together to gather informa
tion on reaction to the question of
taking examinations outside the
classroom.
This, Stahr said, would be the
function of the special subcommit
tee approved by Excom last night.
Stahr said the subcommittee
would work closely with the Stu
dent Affairs—a subcommittee of
the Academic Council headed by
Professor George Knowles.
(The Academic Council is com
posed of some 400 professors, as
sistant and associate professors, and
is headed by President Wallace
Sterling. Dean Winbigler is secre
tary.)
The Student Manager said he
believed it would take "at least
this quarter" for the student sub
committee to obtain the neces
sary information to present to the
Council for Student Affairs.
Excom was also presented a re
port on the Honor Code, containing
background and history of the Code
and a resume of the current prob
lem. The report was written by
Chuck GofT, chairman of the Fun
damental Standard Committee.

John Stahr, student manager,
amended the motion, With the ap
proval of Excom, calling for the ap
pointment of a preliminary com
mittee of meet with the Student
Affairs Committee of the Academic
Council to decide on the questions
to be discussed by the special sub
committee.
Members of both the special
subcommittee and the preliminary
committee arc expected to be ap

ing.
Stahr said the current problem
over the Honor Code—whether or
not students should be allowed to
take examinations out of the class
room—was presented at a meeting
of the Summer Excom by Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler and
Professor Raymond Harriman of the
Department of Classics.
At that meeting, and in subse
quent talks with Dean Winbigler,
Stahr said the Dean reported that
within the past year some profes
sors expressed concern to the
Dean that increasing numbers of
students were taking examina
tions out of class.
The current Honor Code issue
stemmed from these reports, Stahr
said.
As yet, there is no eomon agree
ment among the faculty on the ques
tion.
In a meeting last week with
ASSU President Don Lo/.abnick,
ASSU Vice President Jeannie
Bobis, Daily Editor Hadlcy Roff,
and Stahr, Dean Winbigler agreed
with the student leaders that stu
dents and faculty members should
work together to gather informa
tion on reaction to the question of
taking examinations outside the
classroom.
This, Stahr said, would be the
function of the special subcommit
tee approved by Excom last night.
Stahr said the subcommittee
would work closely with the Stu
dent Affairs—a subcommittee of
the Academic Council headed by
Professor George Knowles.
(The Academic Council is com
posed of some 400 professors, as
sistant and associate professors, and
is headed by President Wallace
Sterling. Dean Winbigler is secre
tary.)
The Student Manager said he
believed it would take "at least
this quarter" for the student sub
committee to obtain the neces
sary information to present to the
Council for Student Affairs.
Excom was also presented a re
port on the Honor Code, containing
background and history of the Code
and a resume of the current prob
lem. The report was written by
Chuck GofT, chairman of the Fun
damental Standard Committee.
The Executive Comittee in its
first meeting of the quarter last
night approved a motion to ap
point a special subcommittee to
work with the faculty in finding
a solution to questions concern
ing a possible revision in the
Honor Code.
The motion, unanimously ap
proved by Excom members, speci
fied that the special committee be
composed of members of the Funda
mental Standard Committee, the
Academic Council, Council for Stu
dent Control, and Excom.
