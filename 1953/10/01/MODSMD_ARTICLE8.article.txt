### 
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 30 (UP)â€”
Gov. Earl Warren's successor as
California's chief executive, Lt. Gov.
Goodwin J. Knight, heard the news
that will make him Governor of the
state on an airliner's radio today.
Knight's elevation to the gover
norship on Warren's appointment as
Chief Justice of the United States
climaxed years of intensive effort
to gain the state's highest office.
As early as last spring the 56-
ycar - old Knight admitted to the
United Press that he would be a
candidate for Governor in 1954,
even if he had to run against War
ren.
Knight himself says he is a con
servative Republican and his ac
tions and utterances as Lieutenant
Governor indicate he will not follow
in full the progressive Republican
platform Warren advocated.
Knight was reared in Los Ange
les and attended Stanford Univer
sity, getting his law degree at Cor
nell. \
