## Ike Seeks Probe Of Russian Policy 
### 
W AHIIINI ii OX, Oct. 1 (fP;
President Ki mhower and his top
diplomatic rifles were urgently
seeking ome new diplomatic test
today to nail down once and for all
whether Russia really wants peace
Ot still is bent on world conquest.
Officials -aid the answer largely
will decide whether the adminis
tration can press ahead with plans
to balance the budget and cut t.ixcs
or whether these goals must be put
aside in favor of a drastic step-up
in arm- spending.
Mr. Eisenhower summed up the
issue yesterday when he told his
new. conference that Russia's pos
es, ion of the dread hydrogen bomb
had reopened the entire question of
defense planning and made it all
important to determine Russia's
true aims.
Adlai I'". Stevenson, the 1952 Dem
ocratic Presidential standard bearer,
propo ed to Mr. Eisenhower today
that the United States offer Russia
a non-aggression pact. He said the
Preisdent "seemed very much in
terested' 1 and did not label the plan
"appeasement" as have some Re
p Ã¼blicans.
Stevenson said that if the Soviet
Union spurned the proposal it
would "deprive Russia of the peace
propaganda it now has" and show
where the Commuists really stand
on the issue of peace.
Diplomatic officials raised the
prospect, however, that there may
never be any single dramatic epi
sode that would expose Russia's
true aims. Rather, they said, the
United States merely may continue
lo try to pin down the Krqjnli# on
such issues as Germany, Austria,
and Korea.
