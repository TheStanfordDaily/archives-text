# Cards Will Sparkle at Grid Games

### DAVE BROWNWOOD 
The Red will shine this year!
As Indian rooters raise their
cards to form the big "S" at the
UCLA game Oct. 17 something
new will appear the cards will
have a mirror like surface that
reflects the sun, and Bruin root
ers will see an "S" that looks al
most on fire in the sunlight.
Four of the eight colors used in
card stunts are now of the metallic
type In addition to red, there will
be bine, silver, and gold glittering
in the Stanford rooting section.
When I'SC used metallic cards
last yenr on the suun.v side of
Memorial Stadium their stunts
were eon-idcred \o effective that
similar cards for the Stanford
section were suggested. Through
the efforts of itally Coin member
.Fim Roberts, the ASSC purchased
new cards this summer.
With Stanford'.- rooters now on
the sunny .ide of the Stadium, the
shining colors are expected to be
fully effective in this season's card
stunts.
Having the rooting section on the
east side of the stadium is another
of the innovations for thi. year's
home games. Previously, Stanford
students always sat on the shady
• ide ,it football game — at home or
away.
For several yours it has been
the policy of every other Coast
school to gi\e the visiting team
and rooters the shad} side, and
this season the Farm has followed
that sportsmanlike tradition.
But although there have been a
■ few changes, most of the familiar

traditions connectcd with Cardinal
football names arc still present.
