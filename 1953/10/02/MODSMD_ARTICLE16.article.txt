### RUSS WILKS 
Stanford gets another crack at Illinois tomorrow tn Memory
Stadium, Champaign-Urbana, bill the Illini once again figure t
master the Indians of Chuck Taylor just as they did in tho 196
Rose Bowl encounter.
The Cards, however, would like nothing better than to avonr

"♦"that painful 40-7 licking with i
decisive victory over Ray EMct'n
crew in one of the week's top
grid intersectionals.
This week Taylor has emphasized
the ' blocking" which was definite
missing from the COP and Oreg n
encounters. Taylor has also s> ( .
the passing attack which indie; t'.
that Bob Garrett will be throwing
i more than three passes tomorrow
| afternoon.
Taylor has made two big
. changes in the backficld for <•
morrow's game. Ernie
hard-running, hustling halfback,
will replace Bill Rogers at righ!
halfback. Doni will be the only
sophomore in the starting liner o
The other change will llnd Bil'
Wentworth at fullbacks Wc
worth, who did nothing more tin i
fill out Taylor's kick-olT plato »■
last year, has proved he has hoth
way ability. Offensively h-> and
• Jarvis Watson shape up equally
with Wentworth gaining tlir* stint
ing nod beci vse of his defensi , <
play.
Ron Cook is established ni !ei"
1 half and Garrett, who looked a
' ; hundred per cent better on defen:-
1 last week, may go CO minutes ag. .
at quarterback.
Another development this week
! saw the advancement of Jim Tru
1 her from the Braves to the vat ; it
! Truher was instrumental in the JV .-
14-7 victory over the Alameda N;
j val Air Station a week ago.
With the possibility oi a Stanford
aerial circus, Sam Morley will get
| the starting end assignment. Rumor
| had it that Marv TennefOss would
replace Morley, but Taylor killed
i the rumor when he stated that the
Oregon movies showed that Mor
i ley played a better game than most
; people thought.
John Steinberg will start at the
other end. Matt Armitage and
Barry Smith continue to be stal
warts at tackle. Norm Manooftian
has been padded and bandaged
again and will be ready to go at
guard as will Phil Wilson, with
j Len Doster also Expected to see
plenty of action.
Center and linebacker Ted Tan
ner rounds out the starting team.
As if hearing about the Rose Bowl
defeat wasn't enough of an incen
tive, seven of the Cards probably
will be a little more bitter, because
they played in the game. These
players include Morley, Manoogian,
Garrett, Cook, Steinberg, Tanner,
and Tennefoss.
Word comes from Illinois that
Coach Ray Eliot has given his team
| a lot of pass defense work and
I scrimmaged his squad Tuesday and
Wednesday.
Illinois is expected to reiy on

Illini can go through the air, «le

nell lias gradauted to the pro
j ranks. Kindheck will quarter

Scouting reports state that the
Illini are not big, but that they are
rough and fast. Illinois was picked
as the thirty-firth team in the
j nation while Stanford was selected
| as the forty-fifth by the Sporting
News. Most experts see the game
going to the team that gets the
breaks. Chuck Taylor wants them.

This week Taylor has emphasized
the ' blocking" which was definite
missing from the COP and Oreg n
encounters. Taylor has also s> ( .
the passing attack which indie; t'.
that Bob Garrett will be throwing
i more than three passes tomorrow
| afternoon.
Taylor has made two big
. changes in the backficld for <•
morrow's game. Ernie
hard-running, hustling halfback,
will replace Bill Rogers at righ!
halfback. Doni will be the only
sophomore in the starting liner o
The other change will llnd Bil'
Wentworth at fullbacks Wc
worth, who did nothing more tin i
fill out Taylor's kick-olT plato »■
last year, has proved he has hoth
way ability. Offensively h-> and
• Jarvis Watson shape up equally
with Wentworth gaining tlir* stint
ing nod beci vse of his defensi , <
play.
Ron Cook is established ni !ei"
1 half and Garrett, who looked a
' ; hundred per cent better on defen:-
1 last week, may go CO minutes ag. .
at quarterback.
Another development this week
! saw the advancement of Jim Tru
1 her from the Braves to the vat ; it
! Truher was instrumental in the JV .-
14-7 victory over the Alameda N;
j val Air Station a week ago.
With the possibility oi a Stanford
aerial circus, Sam Morley will get
| the starting end assignment. Rumor
| had it that Marv TennefOss would
replace Morley, but Taylor killed
i the rumor when he stated that the
Oregon movies showed that Mor
i ley played a better game than most
; people thought.
John Steinberg will start at the
other end. Matt Armitage and
Barry Smith continue to be stal
warts at tackle. Norm Manooftian
has been padded and bandaged
again and will be ready to go at
guard as will Phil Wilson, with
j Len Doster also Expected to see
plenty of action.
Center and linebacker Ted Tan
ner rounds out the starting team.
As if hearing about the Rose Bowl
defeat wasn't enough of an incen
tive, seven of the Cards probably
will be a little more bitter, because
they played in the game. These
players include Morley, Manoogian,
Garrett, Cook, Steinberg, Tanner,
and Tennefoss.
Word comes from Illinois that
Coach Ray Eliot has given his team
| a lot of pass defense work and
I scrimmaged his squad Tuesday and
Wednesday.
Illinois is expected to reiy on
l its ground game, but Ed Kind
j beck has served notice that the

Illini can go through the air, «le
| spite the fact that Tommy O'Con
nell lias gradauted to the pro
j ranks. Kindheck will quarter
| hack the team from the T-foi:-
I mation.
Scouting reports state that the
Illini are not big, but that they are
rough and fast. Illinois was picked
as the thirty-firth team in the
j nation while Stanford was selected
| as the forty-fifth by the Sporting
News. Most experts see the game
going to the team that gets the
breaks. Chuck Taylor wants them.
