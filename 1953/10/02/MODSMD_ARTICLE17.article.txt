## 
### 
The Executive Committee ap- !
proved a motion Wednesday night :
calling for the formation of a men's !
halls council to help improve the
living in Toyon, Crothers, Encina,
communication between students
and Stern Halls, and the men's halls
representative to Excom.
The proposed council, which Ex- j
com accepted for one quarter on a J
trial basis, will bo re-evaluated at
the end of the quarter when Excom
will decide if the council shall be
continued as a permanent body.
Bob Mishell, men's halls repre
sentative to Excom, said it was
hoped this council will ''help the
representative to represent his con
stituency more effectively and more
democratically.''
The proposed council would be
composed of representatives from
each wing in the men's halls and
one representative from each of the
seven eating clubs.
The men's haiJ representative to
Excom would preside over the
council.
In other action, Excom;
1. Named Pat Dougherty to suc
ceed Jim Banks as chief of the
student police. Dougherty is a mem
ber of Theta Chi fraternity.
2. Approved the appointment tof
Glen Smith, chairman of the Grad
uate Student Association, as gradu
ate student repreentative to Ex
com. The appointment gives the
graduate students two Excom rep
resentatives. Excom felt the pres
ent size of the graduate class called
i for the extra representation.
3. Approved a motion to make the
ASSU president or his designee an
ox-ofTicio member of the board of
j management of the Palo Alto chap
iter of the American Red Cross for
one year, at the end of which the
