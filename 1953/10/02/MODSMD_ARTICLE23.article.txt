### DICK MANSFIELD 
YOl CAN'T LOOK IT UP
TIm'p il is World Series time, and that reminds us
ol various baseball storir: . There was James Thur
b«*i •; groat story about a midget baseball player,
You Could Look II Up," and then Bill Veeck's
literary allusion at Si. Louis a couple of years ago,
and then Fred Hutchinson's literary illusion at De
li oit (his year, having to do with one Ted Gray,
a pitcher and generally referred to as Gray's Al-

lergy. Gray's Allergy this year
: < emed to be anyone with a bat
in his hands, but the same goes
lor a lot of other Detroit pitchers,
and Cray, given a team to pitch
for, would probably win. Inciden
tally, since that Gray's Allergy
j« I. first crept out into the world,
Sports Editor Pete Grothe has
twice threatened to send me to
the St. Louis I J ost-Dispatch for an
undisclosed sum, probably pay-

able to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
Which brings, us to a tale of Paul Fagan before
his parting with the San Francisco Seals, given to
me as absolutely true by a shady-looking character
in an alley in Snn Jose. Seems that on this occasion,
Kagan called a quick press conference.
"Boys," he said, "I guess I won't sell the club for
n while. Bill Veeck just sold me a real crowd-pleaser!"
"Can he hit a curve ball?" someone asked.
' He pitches! I just acquired a southpaw chimpanzee,
named Maurice, and Veeck claims that he would have

heen twice as good as Paige only he spent most of his
brilliant career in the Bronx Zoo. This is sure-fire!"
The scribes departed to spread the word. That night,
7.'!1 fans crowded into Seals Stadium. It was a tense
game, and whoever was in seventh place didn't even
score until the second inning, but by the eighth the
score was 17 lo !! and San Francisco was losing. The
Seals' fifth pitcher walked three men in a row in the
top of the eighth, and the Seals' manager wig-wagged
into the bullpen.
Up to the mound strode Maurice, the southpaw
chimpanzee. He looked cool. "Know the signals?"
said the catcher. Maurice waved him away without
a word. The visitors' cleanup hitter was due, but their
manager, employing strategy, inserted his own son,
Biffy, age five, to pinch-hit. The crowd was going
wild.
"Yeadeol' pepper, Maurice!" yapped somebody out
of that infield, and Maurice flung in a fork ball. Biffy
belted it 520 feet, clear out of the park in dead center
for a grand-slam homerun. "Confounded rabbit ball,"
muttered Maurice, and stalked off the hill.
Later, Fagan tried to entice Maurice to stay with
the Seals, even offering to sell him the team, but
Maurice was disgusted. "You'll have to get yourself
another crowd-pleaser," he said. When it developed
that the game was ruled out because neither Maurice
nor Biffy was signed to a contract, they both jumped
to the Mexican League, arriving just after the season
ended, and at last report from my San Jose source,
they were great buddies and were partying it up in
Tijuana together.
