# CAMPUS OPINION
## Rebukes the Daily for 'Sensationalism' 
### 
To the Editor:
Blood and gore all over the floor and the Daily
without its spoon. Can't our campus paper find
anything bettor to print than morbid
I do not say that the five by six front page picture
in Thursday's paper was disgusting, but I am sup
prised and a little disappointed at seeing "Yellow
Dog" tactics displayed with such gusto. (I am refer
ring to the picture of Tuesday's collision on Alpine
Drive.)
The Daily is not trying to sell papers and the
boxes are not going to empty any faster because
sanguinary photography accompanies front page fea
tures. The Daily is usually both entertaining |nd con
structively informative. This particular feature is
neither of these and I hotly object to having human
catastrophe so forcefully injected into my morning
coffee.
The Daily photographer should be commended for
being so "on-the-spot,' and the journalism of the
article itself is not objectionable. However, I hope
yesterday's "front page splash" is not indicative of
future policies of the Stanford Daily.

EDITOR'S NOTE—The picture was printed not for
the sake of simple sensationalism, but for a very
specific and. we think, justified purpose. That is
lo illustrate forcefully the need for extra driving
care along Alpine Road, the scene of a number of

tragic crashes. The roadway, itself adequately paved
and well maintained, according to officials, has be
come a speedway, particularly for Stanford stu
dents. Such highway antics must be eliminated,
and quickly, if the death and injury toll is to be
kept down. The Daily does not like to print grisly
pictures. We do not like to report bloody accidents.
We do not like to upset our readers' morning cof
fee. However —and this most of all—we do not
want to see any other Stanford students lying un
conscious on the pavement of Alpine Koad.
