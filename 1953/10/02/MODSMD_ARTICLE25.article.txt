# Shocked But Not Surprised

To the Editor:
I was shocked, but not too surprised when I read
of the fatal accident on Alpine Road.
One trip through the Stanford campus at 8:00 a.m.
is sufficient to convince one he had better increase
his life insurance or find a long way home. Just this
morning someone decided to pass me on Galvey
street approaching Encina. He chickened out though
when somebody else from the opposite direction did
the s.-irfe thing—ah, for the carefree traffic before
autumn registration. Perhaps some of the older stu
dents ought to point out that the place for "smartness"
is in the classroom!
