"It was inspiring, exciting, there just isn't an adjective strong
enough to express my enthusiasm."
This is how Don Lozabnick, ASSU president, described his trip
to Berlin this summer which he took in conjunction with the Berlin
affiliation commiftee and to Istanbul as a participant from the

United States to the World Uni- H
versity Service Assembly.
Stanford is a contributor to the
World University Service and Lo
zabnick was chairman of the drive
which was conducted for this or
ganization last year.
WUS is a non-political organiza
tion orecognized by UNESCO. It
deals with the needs of universities
throughout the world. It was the
United States office of this group
which invited Lozabnick to make
the trip.
From July 9 to 22 Lozabnick
was in Istanbul along with repre
sentatives from 20 nations.
Throughout his trip, he says, he
found the people friendly and dis
covered a feeling of mutual un
derstanding among students just
because they were students and
political and national barriers
were deleted.
Living, thinking, working to
gether with no political bounds
proved to be the essence of the
conference, according to the ASSU
president.
The World University Service As
sembly, held in the conference, room
at Istanbul where NATO meets. !
consisted of discusions of
sity problems. The Assembly laid
plans for this year. Two day dis
cussion, "The University and Soci
ety," highlighted the conference.
Though Don was not there in the
capacity of a tourist he was pro
vided with the opportunity to see
some places of historical interest.
Among these were St. Sophia and
the sultan's palace in Istanbul. Not
ed people he met were the mayor
governor of Istanbul and General
Timberman, general of the U.S.
forces in Berlin.
Knowing little foreign language,
and traveling alone, he foufid it
possible to get along. Concerning
his language handicap. Don found
he could make other people un
derstand by using his hands. "And
you can always draw pictures,"
he smiled.
Jeanie Bobis, ASSU vice-presi
dent, and John Stahr, ASSU busi

ness manager, now each have a fez
from Turkey, courtesy of Don.
(Fezes, he reports, are no longer
worn in Turkey.)
Two weeks before going to Tur
key, Don was in Berlin, conferring
with student leaders of the Free
University and State Department
scholars who were here last year.
In Berlin he stayed with Ro Rosen
feld, an ex-exchange scholar, and
her family.
With Berlin students acting as
interpreters, lie attended meet
ings of student government at the
Free University of Berlin; visited
General Timberman and refugee
camps.
Lozabnick reports that the basic
i problem at the Free University is
1 rehabilitation of East Berlin stu
dents who cross the border into
! free Berlin. Over 40 per cent of the
students come from the Eastern
Zone. Don arrived in Berlin as the
! riots were subsiding.
Lozabnick was fortunate enough
i to be in a refugee camp where some
J of the original rioters were housed.
I According to the workers, work had
| been increased by 10 per cent with
' no pay increase. Three foremen in
cited their men to demonstration
and led them through the treet, 750
and led them through the street, 750
feeling to Lozabnick: "We work but
j they stand at our back with guns."
The West Berliners Don met felt
inspired by their fellow German
j across the border.
From his casual observations Lo
zabnick felt that "there may be uni
fication sooner than many expect."
Don's itinerary took him to
Paris, Berlin, Istanbul, Israel,
j Florence, and Geneva. It was in
Florence that he met the Stanford
tour. "It was wonderful to run
into Americans and especially
people from Stanford," he said.
Lozabnick's tour finished up back
in the U.S. when he went to the Na
tional Student Association eonfer
: ence at Ohio State. Here he was an
I observer representing Stanford.

"It was inspiring, exciting, there just isn't an adjective strong
enough to express my enthusiasm."
This is how Don Lozabnick, ASSU president, described his trip
to Berlin this summer which he took in conjunction with the Berlin
affiliation commiftee and to Istanbul as a participant from the

United States to the World Uni- H
versity Service Assembly.
Stanford is a contributor to the
World University Service and Lo
zabnick was chairman of the drive
which was conducted for this or
ganization last year.
WUS is a non-political organiza
tion orecognized by UNESCO. It
deals with the needs of universities
throughout the world. It was the
United States office of this group
which invited Lozabnick to make
the trip.
From July 9 to 22 Lozabnick
was in Istanbul along with repre
sentatives from 20 nations.
Throughout his trip, he says, he
found the people friendly and dis
covered a feeling of mutual un
derstanding among students just
because they were students and
political and national barriers
were deleted.
Living, thinking, working to
gether with no political bounds
proved to be the essence of the
conference, according to the ASSU
president.
The World University Service As
sembly, held in the conference, room
at Istanbul where NATO meets. !
consisted of discusions of
sity problems. The Assembly laid
plans for this year. Two day dis
cussion, "The University and Soci
ety," highlighted the conference.
Though Don was not there in the
capacity of a tourist he was pro
vided with the opportunity to see
some places of historical interest.
Among these were St. Sophia and
the sultan's palace in Istanbul. Not
ed people he met were the mayor
governor of Istanbul and General
Timberman, general of the U.S.
forces in Berlin.
Knowing little foreign language,
and traveling alone, he foufid it
possible to get along. Concerning
his language handicap. Don found
he could make other people un
derstand by using his hands. "And
you can always draw pictures,"
he smiled.
Jeanie Bobis, ASSU vice-presi
dent, and John Stahr, ASSU busi

ness manager, now each have a fez
from Turkey, courtesy of Don.
(Fezes, he reports, are no longer
worn in Turkey.)
Two weeks before going to Tur
key, Don was in Berlin, conferring
with student leaders of the Free
University and State Department
scholars who were here last year.
In Berlin he stayed with Ro Rosen
feld, an ex-exchange scholar, and
her family.
With Berlin students acting as
interpreters, lie attended meet
ings of student government at the
Free University of Berlin; visited
General Timberman and refugee
camps.
Lozabnick reports that the basic
i problem at the Free University is
1 rehabilitation of East Berlin stu
dents who cross the border into
! free Berlin. Over 40 per cent of the
students come from the Eastern
Zone. Don arrived in Berlin as the
! riots were subsiding.
Lozabnick was fortunate enough
i to be in a refugee camp where some
J of the original rioters were housed.
I According to the workers, work had
| been increased by 10 per cent with
' no pay increase. Three foremen in
cited their men to demonstration
and led them through the treet, 750
and led them through the street, 750
feeling to Lozabnick: "We work but
j they stand at our back with guns."
The West Berliners Don met felt
inspired by their fellow German
j across the border.
From his casual observations Lo
zabnick felt that "there may be uni
fication sooner than many expect."
Don's itinerary took him to
Paris, Berlin, Istanbul, Israel,
j Florence, and Geneva. It was in
Florence that he met the Stanford
tour. "It was wonderful to run
into Americans and especially
people from Stanford," he said.
Lozabnick's tour finished up back
in the U.S. when he went to the Na
tional Student Association eonfer
: ence at Ohio State. Here he was an
I observer representing Stanford.

"It was inspiring, exciting, there just isn't an adjective strong
enough to express my enthusiasm."
This is how Don Lozabnick, ASSU president, described his trip
to Berlin this summer which he took in conjunction with the Berlin
affiliation commiftee and to Istanbul as a participant from the

United States to the World Uni- H
versity Service Assembly.
Stanford is a contributor to the
World University Service and Lo
zabnick was chairman of the drive
which was conducted for this or
ganization last year.
WUS is a non-political organiza
tion orecognized by UNESCO. It
deals with the needs of universities
throughout the world. It was the
United States office of this group
which invited Lozabnick to make
the trip.
From July 9 to 22 Lozabnick
was in Istanbul along with repre
sentatives from 20 nations.
Throughout his trip, he says, he
found the people friendly and dis
covered a feeling of mutual un
derstanding among students just
because they were students and
political and national barriers
were deleted.
Living, thinking, working to
gether with no political bounds
proved to be the essence of the
conference, according to the ASSU
president.
The World University Service As
sembly, held in the conference, room
at Istanbul where NATO meets. !
consisted of discusions of
sity problems. The Assembly laid
plans for this year. Two day dis
cussion, "The University and Soci
ety," highlighted the conference.
Though Don was not there in the
capacity of a tourist he was pro
vided with the opportunity to see
some places of historical interest.
Among these were St. Sophia and
the sultan's palace in Istanbul. Not
ed people he met were the mayor
governor of Istanbul and General
Timberman, general of the U.S.
forces in Berlin.
Knowing little foreign language,
and traveling alone, he foufid it
possible to get along. Concerning
his language handicap. Don found
he could make other people un
derstand by using his hands. "And
you can always draw pictures,"
he smiled.
Jeanie Bobis, ASSU vice-presi
dent, and John Stahr, ASSU busi

ness manager, now each have a fez
from Turkey, courtesy of Don.
(Fezes, he reports, are no longer
worn in Turkey.)
Two weeks before going to Tur
key, Don was in Berlin, conferring
with student leaders of the Free
University and State Department
scholars who were here last year.
In Berlin he stayed with Ro Rosen
feld, an ex-exchange scholar, and
her family.
With Berlin students acting as
interpreters, lie attended meet
ings of student government at the
Free University of Berlin; visited
General Timberman and refugee
camps.
Lozabnick reports that the basic
i problem at the Free University is
1 rehabilitation of East Berlin stu
dents who cross the border into
! free Berlin. Over 40 per cent of the
students come from the Eastern
Zone. Don arrived in Berlin as the
! riots were subsiding.
Lozabnick was fortunate enough
i to be in a refugee camp where some
J of the original rioters were housed.
I According to the workers, work had
| been increased by 10 per cent with
' no pay increase. Three foremen in
cited their men to demonstration
and led them through the treet, 750
and led them through the street, 750
feeling to Lozabnick: "We work but
j they stand at our back with guns."
The West Berliners Don met felt
inspired by their fellow German
j across the border.
From his casual observations Lo
zabnick felt that "there may be uni
fication sooner than many expect."
Don's itinerary took him to
Paris, Berlin, Istanbul, Israel,
j Florence, and Geneva. It was in
Florence that he met the Stanford
tour. "It was wonderful to run
into Americans and especially
people from Stanford," he said.
Lozabnick's tour finished up back
in the U.S. when he went to the Na
tional Student Association eonfer
: ence at Ohio State. Here he was an
I observer representing Stanford.
