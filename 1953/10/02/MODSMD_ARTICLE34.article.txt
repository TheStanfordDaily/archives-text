ON THEIR SHOULDERSâ€”Stanford's traveling footballers will
be counting heavily on Coach Dutch Fehring (above) and End
Sam Morley (above right) tomorrow when they tackle Illinois.
Fehring's scout report on the Illini-Nebraska game last week
will be the basis for Stanford strategy. Morley is expected to
be on the receiving end of many Indian aerials when Bob Gar
rett opens up the passing attack.
