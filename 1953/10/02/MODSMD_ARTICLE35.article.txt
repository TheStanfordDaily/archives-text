### MIKE HUDSON Daily Correspondent 
NEW YORK, Oct. 2 —Preacher
Roe's old nemesis, the home-run
ball, cost him a ball game today as
the Yanks just about iced the Se
ries with a 4 to 2 win.
Tomorrow Brooklyn retreats to
the more friendly confines of Eb
betts Field in their last-gasp at
tempt to halt the Yanks from an
other world crown. Casey Stengel
has a real money pitcher, Vic Ras
chi, ready to go while Chuck Dres
sen will send out Carl Erkine, who
lasted one inning in the opener.
Today's thriller saw Mickey
Mantle's towering eighth - inning
homer with Hank Bauer aboard
break up a pitching duel between
Ed Lopat and Preacher Roe.
The Yanks reached Iloe for a
run in the first as Gene Wood
ling walked, went to second on j
another walk, and scored on two
successive long flies.
The Dodgers scored a pair of more
legitimate tallies in the fourth as
Carl Furillo and Gil Hodges, who
has been the Bums' series star so
far, singled and Billy Cox doubled.
The Yanks tied it up when Billy
Martin homered off Jack Robinson's
glove. This ended the scoring until
the eighth.
Yank pitcher Ed Lopat put on his \
usual show as he nothing-balled his j
way to a seven-hit victory. Neither
he nor Roe throws fast enough to ;
dent a window, and the millions of !
viewers were treated to the ludi- j
crous sight of the greatest hitters |
in the game vainly attempting to |
get a bat on the offerings of Mes- '
sieurs Roe and Lopat. In general, j
thev couldn't do it.
