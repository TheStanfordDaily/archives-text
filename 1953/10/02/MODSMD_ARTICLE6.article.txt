"Do students of this University
have the legal right under the
Honor Code to take their exam
inations from the appointed ex
amination roorn and write them,
in whole or in part, outside that
room?"
This was the "question in point"
in a written report presented to
members of the Executive Commit
tee Wednesday night by Chuck GofT,
chairman of the Fundamental Stand
ard Committee.
GofT's report, which contained a
history and resume of the Honor
Code, said that the question has
arisen frequently since the inception
of the Honor Code in 1921, and, as
far as his committee could ascertain,
no constitutionally valid rule exists
which .states students' rights in the
matter.
The report explained that the
question was a topic of "serious de
bate" at a meeting of tht Student-
Faculty • Education Committee last
spring "at which time the faculty
members present agreed the stu-

dents, acting under the rights be
stowed upon them by legislation of
the Academic Council in 1021,
should decide the controversy so as
to present a uniform rule to which
students and faculty might refer in
the matter of examinations."
(The legislation of tlie Academic
Council—composed of some 400 pro
fessors, assistant and associate pro
fessors— stated that responsibility
for honesty in examination., is placed
upon students.
It further stipulated that instruc
tors shall provide a room where

(he examination may he held with
out crowding and after the ques
tions have boon presented the in
structor shall leave the room.)
The faculty present at the spring
meeting, the report continued, in
dicated that their desire for an of
ficial ruling was "typical of the feel
ing of the entire faculty."
The report also pointed out that
Dean of' Students H. Donald Win
bigler became interested in the ques
tion last, spring and that lie too .sug
gested that students draft a rule on
the Code.
"Students are unaware of their
rights on the matter,'' the report
said. "They are told they have the
privilege of writing an exam any
place they desire. But occasionally
an instructor will refuse them this
right, and they do not know by
what authority he is able to do
this."
Goff's report indicated that the
Fundamental Standard Committee
feels this "weakens the Honor Code
by making it appear inconsistent to
the student body,"
The report declared that the stu
dents' right to write exams out of
the classroom has been attacked on
several occasions on he grounds that
no rule exists which "positively gives
the students this right."

no constitutionally valid rule exists

(The legislation of tlie Academic

"Students are unaware of their
rights on the matter,'' the report
said. "They are told they have the
privilege of writing an exam any
place they desire. But occasionally
an instructor will refuse them this
right, and they do not know by
what authority he is able to do
this."
Goff's report indicated that the
Fundamental Standard Committee
feels this "weakens the Honor Code
by making it appear inconsistent to
the student body,"
The report declared that the stu

the classroom has been attacked on
several occasions on he grounds that
no rule exists which "positively gives
the students this right."
"Do students of this University

Honor Code to take their exam
