# STANFORD AXE
## UC to Name Axe-Finding Committee 
### BOB REZAK Associate Editor, The Daily 
The University of California's
senior class will take the first
step toward recovering the
stolen Stanford Axe Wednesday
when it is scheduled to appoint
a special Axe-finding committee.
The .renowned Stanford Axe was
snatched from the men's clubroom
of Stephens Union on the Berkeley
campus last June. The olcl blade had
been in UC custody since Novem
ber of 1947. The last year Stanford
won a Big Game was in 194(5.
The Executive Committee of the
Associated Students of the Univer
sity of California has given the sen
ior class council until Nov. 27 to
lincl the Axe. The committee hopes
the Axe will be recovered by Big
Game Rally time on the UC cam
pus.
ASUC President Ralph Vettcr
lein. in a hopeful note, said, "If
anybody can get the Axe, the sen
ior class can."
A UC custodian discovered the
blade was missing from the trophy
case in Stephens Union on June 10.
A window had been broken and
forced open and the hasp had been
' filed from the back of the trophy
I case.
) Lying on a lounge was a polished
plaque—minus the Axe—on which
| the blade had been mounted. A $5
bill was lying on a radiator near the j
i broken window, apparently as pay
! ment for the damage.
No further clues have been re- I
; ported since then.
Some earlier reports indicated the
Axe was still in Berkeley and will
j turn up in due course.
Suspicion was directed for a
j time to Stanford, where, accord
ing to rumors, the Farm's cham
pionship baseball team had bor
rowed the Axe and had taken it to
the Nationals in Omaha for dis
play there.
A team spokesman, questioned
about the theft, replied, ''What
Axe?" It didn't turn up in Oma
ha, he said, and there the matter
rested as far as Stanford was con
cerned.
The Axe is traditionally presented
to the winner of the annual Big
Game.
