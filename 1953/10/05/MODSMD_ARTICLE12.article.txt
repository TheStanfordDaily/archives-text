### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 4 (UP)â€”The
United States still is cool to the idea
of a top-level Big Four meeting to
consider cold war issues but has
not slammed the door completely on
such a proposal, diplomatic sources
reported today.
The difficulty involved in easing
cold war tensions was underscored
last week when the Soviet Union
practically ignored a Big Three bid
to meet at Lugano. Switzerland, Oct.
15 to settle the future of Germany
and Austria.
