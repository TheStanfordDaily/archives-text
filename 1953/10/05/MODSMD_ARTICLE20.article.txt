up team for Illinois' game with Oh in
State this Saturday, shocked a gath
ering of Illini students, alumni and
friends as it rode to two touchdowns
the first two times it had possession
of the ball.
However, once Illinois coach Hay
Eliot derricked some of his startei
the Illini began to move due mainly
to the passing of reserve quarter -
back Elry Falkenstein, the catch in /
of Rocky Ryan and Stan Wallace,
and the dazzling running of J. < ,
Caroline.
On the hasis of their first period
showing the Cards looked as if they

off to their 2X the Indians moved
72 yards in 14 plays. The pay-oil
featured a Boh Garrett l(i-yard
aerial to Sam Morley. Garrett

points.
Illinois then moved to the Indian
30. but wex - e stymied there and again
the Cards rolled to paydirt on tin
pitching arm of Garrett and the fine
running of Ernie Dorn, Jarvis Wat
son and Ron Cook. The big play:
of the drive were a ten-yard pass t<
Cook, an 18-yard gallop by Watson
and a spectacular reception by Mm
ley of a 12-yard toss from Carre 1.1
as he took it away from three de
fenders.
Then after several bucks at lln
line, Garrett hit Dorn who was stop
ped on the one and then Cook drove
over for the score.

offensive thrust of any significance.
Dorn returned the kick-off 27
yards to the Stanford 31. Garrett
passed to Cook who rambled down
the sidelines and was nailed on the
Illini 34. Garrett found Stcinlici
on lhe lfi and from there Bill Tarr,
Dorn. and Watson pounded the line
with Watson finally scoring from
the four to put the Cards into a
short-lived 21-14 lead.
The roof fell in the fourth quar
ter a.s Illinois took advantage of a
fumble, two intercepted passes and
a deflected pass.
The quarter opened with Caroline,
easily the outstanding runner on
the field as he gained 129 yards
l ushing for an average of 0.8 yards
per carry, swivel-hipping 44 yards
to the Cards' 18 where Steinberg
caught him from behind. Two plays
later Falkenstein passed to Ryan

went to the air for Stanford and his
first heave was picked off by Falk
enstein on the Illinois 48. After four
running plays Bates broke over
guard for 27 yards and the final
points of the game.
The Indians were expected to
pass and pass they did. Garrett
in completing 12 out of 23 was
threading a needle in the first
quarter. In total Stanford picked
tip 178 yards passing, good for 1(1
first downs. Cook with 4.4 yards
per carry and Watson with 4.G
were the leading runners for the
Cards.

Defensively Norm Manoogian, |
Barry Smith, and Tanner were the
bulwarks of the squad.
For Stanford it was the second
loss in three games, but with the
passing attack supplemented with a
pretty good running game, a trip to
Portland Saturday for an engage
ment with Oregon State should re
sult in the second scalp of the sea
son.
For the Illini it was ' the eighth |
straight triumph without a defeat j
over a Pacific Coast foe and it also |
indicated to Eliot that he would I
have to do something about his pass j
defense in order to cope with Ohio [
State.

rallied for twenty-six points in the second half to triumph 33 2!
before 32, 793 shirt-sleeved fans in Memorial Stadium, Champaign,
Illinois, Saturday.
Stanford, which was pre-advertised by Illinois papers as a tune

up team for Illinois' game with Oh in
State this Saturday, shocked a gath
ering of Illini students, alumni and
friends as it rode to two touchdowns
the first two times it had possession
of the ball.
However, once Illinois coach Hay
Eliot derricked some of his startei
the Illini began to move due mainly
to the passing of reserve quarter -
back Elry Falkenstein, the catch in /
of Rocky Ryan and Stan Wallace,
and the dazzling running of J. < ,
Caroline.
On the hasis of their first period
showing the Cards looked as if they
were going to more than atone
for the 1 i) 52 40-7 Rose Bowl defeat.
After returning the opening kick
off to their 2X the Indians moved
72 yards in 14 plays. The pay-oil
featured a Boh Garrett l(i-yard
aerial to Sam Morley. Garrett
added the first of his three extra
points.
Illinois then moved to the Indian
30. but wex - e stymied there and again
the Cards rolled to paydirt on tin
pitching arm of Garrett and the fine
running of Ernie Dorn, Jarvis Wat
son and Ron Cook. The big play:
of the drive were a ten-yard pass t<
Cook, an 18-yard gallop by Watson
and a spectacular reception by Mm
ley of a 12-yard toss from Carre 1.1
as he took it away from three de
fenders.
Then after several bucks at lln
line, Garrett hit Dorn who was stop
ped on the one and then Cook drove
over for the score.
Illinois broke the ice with foui
minutes left in the half when Falk

quarterback sneak after sophs Mick

Stanford then engineered its lasl
offensive thrust of any significance.
Dorn returned the kick-off 27
yards to the Stanford 31. Garrett
passed to Cook who rambled down
the sidelines and was nailed on the
Illini 34. Garrett found Stcinlici
on lhe lfi and from there Bill Tarr,
Dorn. and Watson pounded the line
with Watson finally scoring from
the four to put the Cards into a
short-lived 21-14 lead.
The roof fell in the fourth quar
ter a.s Illinois took advantage of a
fumble, two intercepted passes and
a deflected pass.
The quarter opened with Caroline,
easily the outstanding runner on
the field as he gained 129 yards
l ushing for an average of 0.8 yards
per carry, swivel-hipping 44 yards
to the Cards' 18 where Steinberg
caught him from behind. Two plays
later Falkenstein passed to Ryan
who caught the ball after Card Ted
Tanner deflected it into his waiting
arms, for a tally to tie the score at
21 all.
Several minutes later Illinois
punted to the Card 27. On the first
play Garrett's pass was intercepted
by Wally Varnasco who rambled to
the 5. From there Caroline got three
and Miller went the final two to
Illinois a 27-21 advantage.
With time fleeting Jack Gebert
went to the air for Stanford and his
first heave was picked off by Falk
enstein on the Illinois 48. After four
running plays Bates broke over
guard for 27 yards and the final
points of the game.
The Indians were expected to
pass and pass they did. Garrett
in completing 12 out of 23 was
threading a needle in the first
quarter. In total Stanford picked
tip 178 yards passing, good for 1(1
first downs. Cook with 4.4 yards
per carry and Watson with 4.G
were the leading runners for the
Cards.

Defensively Norm Manoogian, |
Barry Smith, and Tanner were the
bulwarks of the squad.
For Stanford it was the second
loss in three games, but with the
passing attack supplemented with a
pretty good running game, a trip to
Portland Saturday for an engage
ment with Oregon State should re
sult in the second scalp of the sea
son.
For the Illini it was ' the eighth |
straight triumph without a defeat j
over a Pacific Coast foe and it also |
indicated to Eliot that he would I
have to do something about his pass j
defense in order to cope with Ohio [
State.

before 32, 793 shirt-sleeved fans in Memorial Stadium, Champaign,
Illinois, Saturday.
Stanford, which was pre-advertised by Illinois papers as a tune

up team for Illinois' game with Oh in
State this Saturday, shocked a gath
ering of Illini students, alumni and
friends as it rode to two touchdowns
the first two times it had possession
of the ball.
However, once Illinois coach Hay
Eliot derricked some of his startei
the Illini began to move due mainly
to the passing of reserve quarter -
back Elry Falkenstein, the catch in /
of Rocky Ryan and Stan Wallace,
and the dazzling running of J. < ,
Caroline.
On the hasis of their first period
showing the Cards looked as if they
were going to more than atone
for the 1 i) 52 40-7 Rose Bowl defeat.
After returning the opening kick
off to their 2X the Indians moved
72 yards in 14 plays. The pay-oil
featured a Boh Garrett l(i-yard
aerial to Sam Morley. Garrett
added the first of his three extra
points.
Illinois then moved to the Indian
30. but wex - e stymied there and again
the Cards rolled to paydirt on tin
pitching arm of Garrett and the fine
running of Ernie Dorn, Jarvis Wat
son and Ron Cook. The big play:
of the drive were a ten-yard pass t<
Cook, an 18-yard gallop by Watson
and a spectacular reception by Mm
ley of a 12-yard toss from Carre 1.1
as he took it away from three de
fenders.
Then after several bucks at lln
line, Garrett hit Dorn who was stop
ped on the one and then Cook drove
over for the score.
Illinois broke the ice with foui
minutes left in the half when Falk

Dorn returned the kick-off 27
yards to the Stanford 31. Garrett
passed to Cook who rambled down
the sidelines and was nailed on the
Illini 34. Garrett found Stcinlici
on lhe lfi and from there Bill Tarr,
Dorn. and Watson pounded the line
with Watson finally scoring from
the four to put the Cards into a
short-lived 21-14 lead.
The roof fell in the fourth quar
ter a.s Illinois took advantage of a
fumble, two intercepted passes and
a deflected pass.
The quarter opened with Caroline,
easily the outstanding runner on
the field as he gained 129 yards
l ushing for an average of 0.8 yards
per carry, swivel-hipping 44 yards
to the Cards' 18 where Steinberg
caught him from behind. Two plays
later Falkenstein passed to Ryan
who caught the ball after Card Ted
Tanner deflected it into his waiting
arms, for a tally to tie the score at
21 all.
Several minutes later Illinois
punted to the Card 27. On the first
play Garrett's pass was intercepted
by Wally Varnasco who rambled to
the 5. From there Caroline got three
and Miller went the final two to
Illinois a 27-21 advantage.
With time fleeting Jack Gebert
went to the air for Stanford and his
first heave was picked off by Falk
enstein on the Illinois 48. After four
running plays Bates broke over
guard for 27 yards and the final
points of the game.
The Indians were expected to
pass and pass they did. Garrett
in completing 12 out of 23 was
threading a needle in the first
quarter. In total Stanford picked
tip 178 yards passing, good for 1(1
first downs. Cook with 4.4 yards
per carry and Watson with 4.G
were the leading runners for the
Cards.

Defensively Norm Manoogian, |
Barry Smith, and Tanner were the
bulwarks of the squad.
For Stanford it was the second
loss in three games, but with the
passing attack supplemented with a
pretty good running game, a trip to
Portland Saturday for an engage
ment with Oregon State should re
sult in the second scalp of the sea
son.
For the Illini it was ' the eighth |
straight triumph without a defeat j
over a Pacific Coast foe and it also |
indicated to Eliot that he would I
have to do something about his pass j
defense in order to cope with Ohio [
State.
It was quite a "tune-up" for Illi
