# CAMPUS OPINION
## 'Something Must Be Done' 
### 
To the Editor:
The fatal automobile accident on Alpine Road last
Wednesday morning added another tragedy to the
great many that have occurred on that lethal road.
I laving b6en the victim of one of these accidents last
year, I wonder if the University and the San Mateo
County officials are at all impressed by this terrible
i(.nation. Has there been any serious attempt to
iope with the problem?
i cannot help feeling that the irreparable damage
done last Wednesday might have been averted.
Since the terrible accidents of last spring, the
Administration might have taken one or a combina
tion of steps that have so often been suggested to
ward reducing the number of accidents. For ex
ample, the University might try to remove certain
places of particular attraction on that road or at
least declare them out of bounds to the students.
Alter all, the same materials are obtainable along
I'll Camino which is more crowded and better pa
(i nl led, therefore safer, according to traffic reports.

Another old suggestion is that the University ought
to abandon its superficial and backward attitude
toward alcoholic drinks, and like many other respec
table institutions—such as Reed College, University
of Wisconsin, Oxford University allow their con
sumption within limits of proper self-conduct on the
campus. Experience has shown that such a policy
is not only realistic, but would perpetuate an atmos
phere of moderation and help develop a mature atti
tude toward alcoholic beverages. Finally, the Ad
ministration could demand that the County of San
Mateo provide more safety signs, lower speed limits,
and above all better law enforcement along the road.
The importance of this problem cannot be exag
gerated and I think it is high time the Administration
and the Student Council were concerned with these
more vital aspects of student life than dormitory
regulations and petty politics. The situation is very
pressing, and before we have another death some
tiling has to be done.
