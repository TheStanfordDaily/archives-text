# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
I would like you to meet Cheeta Grothe. Cheeta
is a girl, one year old, and related to me by adoption,
not by blood. Cheeta Grothe is a monkey.
She is a Spider Monkey, the most acrobatic of all
the simians, and is long and loose like football end
John Steinberg. Only, Steinberg doesn't have a pre
hensile tail.
I bought Cheeta for $10 while trekking through

the steaming tropical jungles of
Southern Mexico this summer
with two good-guy fellow trav
» lers, Dick Weismann and Herm
Christensen. My introduction to
her was a rude one ... a bloody
imprint of monkey teeth on my
hand. Herm Christensen's meet
ing was even more disagreeable.
Herm was holding Cheeta on his
lap, when he discovered that
someone had forgotten to house-

break the monkey. It was one of life's darker mo
ments.
But since then, we've forgotten our differences, and
Cheeta has become a devoted pet.
But she hasn't learned how to be popular at a
party yet. A few weeks ago I was invited to a party,
but my host informed me, "You can't come unless
you bring Cheeta with you."
It was an enjoyable party and things were going
like things should be going at a party, when all of
a sudden Cheeta spotted a guy over in the corner
with two friends, both named Haig. She made a dash
lor him, with a lightning thrust grabbed his cock
tail, and then scurried under the couch with the loot.
At which place she got properly potted. A sober
Cheeta is mischievous enough, but a plastered Cheeta
!<oes ape, as the saying goes.
Cheeta's introduction to members of my family
was an inauspicious one, to say the least. I proudly
announced to my parents that I had purchased a
monkey. Whereupon, Cheeta ran to my mother's
bed. and wet on it.

Nor was my sister any more favorably impressed.
It seemed to disturb her when Cheeta grabbed her
four bottles of perfume and southpawed them around
the room.
Further, it disconcerted my collie to have a mon
key sit on his back, meticulously picking out fleas.
And my cat was chagrined to have her tail pulled
by a newcomer to the household.
But Cheeta was more warmly accepted into the
Stanford community. The establishment where 45
other gentlemen and I join in goodly fellowship
pledged her immediately. This, I was told, set a
precedent. It's the first time a woman has become
a member.
Cheeta has also endeared herself to the football
team, although Chuck Taylor said. "She wouldn't do
as a mascot; we want something more ferocious, like
a lion. However, she would make a good end. She's
got that long reach, plus a tail."
Cheeta has been given a clean bill of health by
the vet, but I had heard that monkeys were sus
ceptible to 13. So during reg-ing, I went up to the
booth which handled the chest X,rays.
*'Er . . . ah . . . pardon me, but I have an unusual
question to ask," I said, stuttering worse than a de
fensive halfback, about to be hit by Norm Manoo
gian.
"Well, what is it?" snapped the man.
"Can my monkey get a chest X-ray?"
"Listen, bud, don't take my time."
''But I'm serious."
"I don't think you see clearly," he said, throwing
some dirt in my face. "We don't give chest X-rays
to monkeys who aren't registered in school."
I fought off a compulsion to stuff my reg book down
his throat and walked off to find out from Harvey
Hall /low the ratio was going.
And how does Cheeta regard mankind, with all his
H-bombs, divorces, and ulcers? She just wraps her
tail around the branch of a tree and lazily swings.
And after all, what more does life have to offer?



MONKEY BUSINESS—(I) "That's enough typing for today. (2)1 think I'll try tcf find something
to eat. (3) Maybe if I hang from the ceiling someone will feed me. (4) This stuff is terrible
, . . tastes like Encina food. (5) No coke left in this bottle. (6) Well, it's back to the books. Why
in hell doesn't this Burns shape up?"

Cheeta's introduction to members of my family
was an inauspicious one, to say the least. I proudly
announced to my parents that I had purchased a
monkey. Whereupon, Cheeta ran to my mother's
bed. and wet on it.

Nor was my sister any more favorably impressed.
It seemed to disturb her when Cheeta grabbed her
four bottles of perfume and southpawed them around
the room.
Further, it disconcerted my collie to have a mon
key sit on his back, meticulously picking out fleas.
And my cat was chagrined to have her tail pulled
by a newcomer to the household.
But Cheeta was more warmly accepted into the
Stanford community. The establishment where 45
other gentlemen and I join in goodly fellowship
pledged her immediately. This, I was told, set a
precedent. It's the first time a woman has become
a member.
Cheeta has also endeared herself to the football
team, although Chuck Taylor said. "She wouldn't do
as a mascot; we want something more ferocious, like
a lion. However, she would make a good end. She's
got that long reach, plus a tail."
Cheeta has been given a clean bill of health by
the vet, but I had heard that monkeys were sus
ceptible to 13. So during reg-ing, I went up to the
booth which handled the chest X,rays.
*'Er . . . ah . . . pardon me, but I have an unusual
question to ask," I said, stuttering worse than a de
fensive halfback, about to be hit by Norm Manoo
gian.
"Well, what is it?" snapped the man.
"Can my monkey get a chest X-ray?"
"Listen, bud, don't take my time."
''But I'm serious."
"I don't think you see clearly," he said, throwing
some dirt in my face. "We don't give chest X-rays
to monkeys who aren't registered in school."
I fought off a compulsion to stuff my reg book down
his throat and walked off to find out from Harvey
Hall /low the ratio was going.
And how does Cheeta regard mankind, with all his
H-bombs, divorces, and ulcers? She just wraps her
tail around the branch of a tree and lazily swings.
And after all, what more does life have to offer?



MONKEY BUSINESS—(I) "That's enough typing for today. (2)1 think I'll try tcf find something

I would like you to meet Cheeta Grothe. Cheeta
is a girl, one year old, and related to me by adoption,
not by blood. Cheeta Grothe is a monkey.
She is a Spider Monkey, the most acrobatic of all
the simians, and is long and loose like football end
John Steinberg. Only, Steinberg doesn't have a pre
hensile tail.
I bought Cheeta for $10 while trekking through

the steaming tropical jungles of
Southern Mexico this summer
with two good-guy fellow trav
» lers, Dick Weismann and Herm
Christensen. My introduction to
her was a rude one ... a bloody
imprint of monkey teeth on my
hand. Herm Christensen's meet
ing was even more disagreeable.
Herm was holding Cheeta on his
lap, when he discovered that
someone had forgotten to house-

break the monkey. It was one of life's darker mo
ments.
But since then, we've forgotten our differences, and
Cheeta has become a devoted pet.
But she hasn't learned how to be popular at a
party yet. A few weeks ago I was invited to a party,
but my host informed me, "You can't come unless
you bring Cheeta with you."
It was an enjoyable party and things were going
like things should be going at a party, when all of
a sudden Cheeta spotted a guy over in the corner
with two friends, both named Haig. She made a dash
lor him, with a lightning thrust grabbed his cock
tail, and then scurried under the couch with the loot.
At which place she got properly potted. A sober
Cheeta is mischievous enough, but a plastered Cheeta

"Listen, bud, don't take my time."
''But I'm serious."
"I don't think you see clearly," he said, throwing
some dirt in my face. "We don't give chest X-rays
to monkeys who aren't registered in school."
I fought off a compulsion to stuff my reg book down
his throat and walked off to find out from Harvey
Hall /low the ratio was going.
And how does Cheeta regard mankind, with all his
H-bombs, divorces, and ulcers? She just wraps her
tail around the branch of a tree and lazily swings.
And after all, what more does life have to offer?



MONKEY BUSINESS—(I) "That's enough typing for today. (2)1 think I'll try tcf find something
to eat. (3) Maybe if I hang from the ceiling someone will feed me. (4) This stuff is terrible

in hell doesn't this Burns shape up?"
I would like you to meet Cheeta Grothe. Cheeta
is a girl, one year old, and related to me by adoption,
not by blood. Cheeta Grothe is a monkey.
She is a Spider Monkey, the most acrobatic of all
the simians, and is long and loose like football end
John Steinberg. Only, Steinberg doesn't have a pre
hensile tail.
I bought Cheeta for $10 while trekking through

the steaming tropical jungles of
Southern Mexico this summer
with two good-guy fellow trav
» lers, Dick Weismann and Herm
Christensen. My introduction to
her was a rude one ... a bloody
imprint of monkey teeth on my
hand. Herm Christensen's meet
ing was even more disagreeable.
Herm was holding Cheeta on his
lap, when he discovered that
someone had forgotten to house-

break the monkey. It was one of life's darker mo
ments.
But since then, we've forgotten our differences, and
Cheeta has become a devoted pet.
But she hasn't learned how to be popular at a
party yet. A few weeks ago I was invited to a party,
but my host informed me, "You can't come unless
you bring Cheeta with you."
It was an enjoyable party and things were going
like things should be going at a party, when all of
a sudden Cheeta spotted a guy over in the corner
with two friends, both named Haig. She made a dash
lor him, with a lightning thrust grabbed his cock
tail, and then scurried under the couch with the loot.
At which place she got properly potted. A sober
Cheeta is mischievous enough, but a plastered Cheeta
!<oes ape, as the saying goes.
Cheeta's introduction to members of my family
was an inauspicious one, to say the least. I proudly
announced to my parents that I had purchased a
monkey. Whereupon, Cheeta ran to my mother's
bed. and wet on it.

Nor was my sister any more favorably impressed.
It seemed to disturb her when Cheeta grabbed her
four bottles of perfume and southpawed them around
the room.
Further, it disconcerted my collie to have a mon
key sit on his back, meticulously picking out fleas.
And my cat was chagrined to have her tail pulled
by a newcomer to the household.
But Cheeta was more warmly accepted into the
Stanford community. The establishment where 45
other gentlemen and I join in goodly fellowship
pledged her immediately. This, I was told, set a
precedent. It's the first time a woman has become
a member.
Cheeta has also endeared herself to the football
team, although Chuck Taylor said. "She wouldn't do
as a mascot; we want something more ferocious, like
a lion. However, she would make a good end. She's
got that long reach, plus a tail."
Cheeta has been given a clean bill of health by
the vet, but I had heard that monkeys were sus
ceptible to 13. So during reg-ing, I went up to the
booth which handled the chest X,rays.
*'Er . . . ah . . . pardon me, but I have an unusual
question to ask," I said, stuttering worse than a de
fensive halfback, about to be hit by Norm Manoo
gian.
"Well, what is it?" snapped the man.
"Can my monkey get a chest X-ray?"
"Listen, bud, don't take my time."
''But I'm serious."
