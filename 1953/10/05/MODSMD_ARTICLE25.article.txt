ELEVATOR GOING DOWN—A dumbwaiter planned for the Stanford Natural History Museum
required a certain amount of groundwork, and here, chiseling away the cement foundations to
make room for dumbwaiter mechanism, are Corp. Yard employees Joseph Garcia (nearer cam
era) and Ed Hadden. The Natural History Museum, one of the oldest buildings on campus, is
currently undergoing renovation. The new dumbwaiter will carry specimens from storage
shelves to laboratories and study areas in the building (see pictures this page).


NICE DOGGlE—Biology graduate
student Jay Savage poses with the
mortal remains of Jock. Dr. David
Starr Jordan's favorite German,
Shepherd. Dr. Jordan, who was
the first president of Stanford and
who started the University's col
lection of natural history speci
mens, had the dog's skeleton
mounted, and it is now stored in
the Stanford Museum of Natural
History. Savage is laughing at
photog's query: "How much is
that fossil in the window?"


AN "AQUARIUM" WITH SHELVES — That's the story at the
Stanford Museum of Natural History, where building renova
tions are being carried on with almost all labor being supplied
by graduate students in the Biology Department. These
ricated shelves, being installed by Biology graduates Ben Banta
(nearer camera) and Paul Araud, will expand shelf space for the
museum's fish collection threefold. Financial support for the
project was collected by the students themselves, who collected
a total of $32,000 from alumni and interested persons over a two
month period last summer.
