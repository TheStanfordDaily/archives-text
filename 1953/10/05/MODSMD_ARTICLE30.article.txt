after dropping twd straight contests
to the Bums by 3-2 and 7-3 counts.

day in an effort to sew up the i
great fall classic. Expected to take

Howard Ehmke of the Athletics. I

eighth-inning homer into the deep
left field stands.

Duke Snider led a Brooklyn attack
which knocked three Yankee pitch
ers, including Whitey Ford, out of \
the box. Meanwhile. Billy Loes was I
handcuffing the Yankee bats, run- !
ning into trouble only in the fifth |

when Billy Martin tripled and Gil
MacDougald homered.
Martin's seventh-inning blast with
a man on base proved to be the
winning margin in yesterday's clas
sic, as a grand slam homer by
Mickey Mantle and round-trippers
by Gene Woodling and McDougald
also were instrumental in the
Bombers' win, Three Dodger pitch
ers were sent to the showers before
