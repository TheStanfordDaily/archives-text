### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 4 (UP)—
Gordon Soltau kicked a field «oal
from the l.'l-yard line with six sec
onds to go today to give the San
Francisco Forty-Niners a 31 -30 vic
tory over the Los Angeles Rams in
one of the most thrill-packed games
ever played in Kezar Stadium.
The Forty - Niners spotted the
Rams 20 points in the first 18 min
utes of play and then came roaring
back to fchalk up their second
straight National Football League
victory and send 4!!,1)22 lans home
deliriously happy.
For the second week in a row the |
hysterical fans tried to tear down
the goal posts.
The Rams, just like the Philadel
phia Eagles of a week ago, started
out as though they would push the
Forty-Niners clear out of the sta
dium.
They got a touchdown and a field
goal in the first period and another
touchdown and another field in !
the second period before San Fran- j
cisco even threatened.
Then Agajanian kicked his third
field goal of the day from the 17-
yard line to put the Rams ahead
30-28 with three minutes to }*o.
On the first play after the kickoll

quarterback Y. A. Tittle passed to
Hugh McElhenny on the 20 and Mr-
Elhenny wormed his way on a great
broken field run 71 yards before he
was caught and knocked out of
bounds on the Rams' nine-yard line
The Forty-Niners then tried three
line plays and itlade only a couple
of .yards. That set the state foe
Soltyu's game - winning kiek that
cause the pro-Forty-Niner fans to
leap in the air and then run o4i the
field.
