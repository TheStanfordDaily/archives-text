## Dean Kates Emphasizes Spiritualism 
### 
In his sermon, Alive
Spiritually," at yesterday's 11 a.m.
service in Memorial Church, the
Very Rev. Frederick Ward Kates,
Dean of the Episcopal Cathedral at
Spokaae, Washington, said, "I covet
for you the experience of coming
alive spiritually in the days ahead."
According to Dean Kates, a "com
plete man" has three birthdays—a
purely biological birthday, an in
tellectual birthday when he "sud
denly comes alive to the whole
world—books, ideas, thought," and a
spiritual birthday when he "comes
alive unto God."
If was this last experience
which Dean Kates emphasized.
He considered it important be
cause through it one may gain
that "cosmic security" which so
many want, may be equipped "to
win the battle of life in the tense
years ahead," may become the
type of leader that . . . our times
call for," may be "a completely
developed person" in "mind, body,
and spirit," and may be "fully
alive while living."
Dean Kates described the experi
ence of coming alive spiritually in
these steps: *
1. "Entering into an understand
ing of the world in which we dwell
and the universe in which wc have
a significant part," a universe which
is both "physical and spiritual" and
has a definite "moral structure."
2. "Acquiring a view of life"
that will answer the questions,
"Where did I come from; who am
I; why am I here; where am I
going?"
3. "Growing into an appreciation
of real Christianity," and of its
"wonder and grandeur."
