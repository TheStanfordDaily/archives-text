### BARBARA TUERK Associate Editor, The Daily 
A group that began as a radio program and grow until it spear
headed last spring's student protest against McCarthyism will
cpen its third year today. Dulles' speech to the American Legion
will be the topic for discussion when the YWCA Public Ailairs
lunch group holds its first meeting ol the year at noon today in

the YWCA lounge, second floor ol
the Women's Clubhouse.
The "Y" lunches provide one of
the few opportunities students have
to sound oiT on current controver
sies.
Out of a heated debate on aca
demic freedom last January came a
sub - group, which spent several
months studying the issues involved
in the controversy and drew up a
petition protesting the activities of
the Congressional committees in
vestigating in the universities.
The petition, signed by 400
students, was presented to Dr.
Sterling and was partially respon
sible for the formation of a joint
Exeom-student committee which
will work this fall to lind possible
ways to express student opinion
on the issues.
Another sub-group spent several
months last year studying the im
plications of the rise of nationalism
in Africa and Asia.
Other popular topics included the
Presidential campaign, religion in
the schools, FEPC, capital punish
ment, and tidelands.
The group started as a radio pro
gram on KZSU the winter before
last. "Y" members who wanted to
give a public affairs forum began
meeting once a month to talk over
current issues as an informal re
hearsal for the broadcast.
The "Y" abandoned its radio
program that spring. "It was too
much trouble," explains Bjorg
Hansen, director of the "Y. M
Hut with the help of the local
YWCA Board, which provides

weekly hot lunches for 25 cents,
(lie group kept going and began
to expand.
From its original live to ten mem
bers, the group's attendance grew to
an average of 25 members last year.
The lunches had to be limited to
the first 30 students signing up, so
that everyone could have a chance
to get his say in.
Carl Stover of the Political Sci
ence Department will be moderat
ing the discussions again this fall.
Brlggie Wallerstein is chairman of
the discussion group.
New students and transfers arc
especially invited to be on hand to
day.
