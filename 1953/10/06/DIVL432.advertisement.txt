WI LLI NC ~^ e P ur P ose Inter-Varsity is to provide fellowship in Christian living through
prayer, Bible study, and social activities —and to bring before university stu
dents the question of Cod's will and the call to serve Him in every area of life.
ABLE Believing that both spiritual and intellectual growth are important to every-
Stanford student, Inter-Varsity believes it can be of service to you in dealing
with life's problems and experiences. Every Tuesday evening at 7:30 p.m. in
the main loung of the Women's Clubhouse, qualified speakers bring us mes-'
sages and lead discussions woven around the general theme of Christian living
and its importance to life—and campus life in particular. This together with
study groups and other interesting and helpful meetings, conferences and'i
doings in connection with other Bay Area colleges and universities rounds out
the program of Inter-Varsity.
WE'VE INTRODUCED YOU to this world-wide fellowship of students and particu
larly to Stanford's Inter-Varsity. Welcoming all students to join in our in
formal doings, Interi-Varsity awaits opportunity to be of service to you. We
would enjoy meeting and having you with us. If possible, maybe we will be
seeing you at our meeting tonight.
