## Warren Takes Office As 14th Chief Justice 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. s—Cali
fornia's Earl Warren gravely j
took office today as the nation's
14th chief justice and immedi- j
ately began the task of steering
the high court through what |
promised to be one of its most
important sessions.
Mr. Warren, who resigned as
Governor oi' California yesterday,
swore to "do equal right to the poor
and to the rich" in a brief but color
ful ceremony witnessed by Presi
dent and Mrs. Eisenhower, Mrs.
Warren, Attorney General Herbert
Brownell Jr., and other dignitaries.
He then was escorted to the high,!
black leather chair—vacated when j
Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson died
of a heart attack Sept. B—and im- |
mediately began his new role.
Mr. Warren, a prosecuting attor
ney during a good part of his career
but never a jurist, was solemn as he
read his oath.
Knight Takes Over
Also today, Goodwin J. Knight,
J)(5, who served for seven years as
Lieutenant Governor of California I
under Earl Warren, took the oath j
as 31st Governor of the state and i
said he was free from any obliga
tions except those he owed to the
voters.
The oath vCas administered to the
former superior court judge by I
State Supreme Court Chief Justice
Phil S. Gibson before more than j
400 persons in the Assembly hall of j
the State Building here.
Knight, considered slightly more
conservative a Republican than
Warren, said he intended to con- i
tinue his predecessor's programs '
and pledged no '"general house- j
cleaning" in the state's administra- I
tion.
