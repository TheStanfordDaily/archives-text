# A 						Star Representative
## 
### 
Yesterday the highest tribunal in the United
States had a new chief—California's Earl War
ren.
Yesterday, too, the highest executive seat
in California had a new occupant —Goodwin
J. Knight.
Both men possess splendid administrative
<-ind political records.
Warren—broad shouldered and big-smiling
is particularly liked and respected by the
citizenry of this state.
Apparently most Californians agree whole
heartedly that President Eisenhower made a
wise selection when he nominated Warren to
be Chief Justice.
There seems to be some trepidation, how
over, over the inevitable promotion of Knight
to the governorship.
It has been known for a long time that Knight
is the star representative in Sacramento of con
servative elements in the state, elements that
have long aimed at unseating Warren and his
liberal administration.
Knight, earlier this year, declared openly
that he would be a candidate for governor even
if Warren decided to run again.
Knight outlined frankly the general pattern
of his political philosophy Sept. 17 when he
announced his intention to campaign for gov
ernor in 1954.
He said:
"Briefly, it shall be my aim to conduct a
business-like administration with emphasis on
reduced spending. My years of experience in
Sacramento convince me that the cost of gov
ernment can be cut without jeopardizing serv
ices essential to the people."
He elaborated his views even further last
week in Berkeley, saying:
"ft is my aim to reduce bureaucracy in Cali
fornia as much as possible. Special interests
have saddled us with boards and commissions
of doubtful value."

These not-too-subtle slams at Warren and his
administration are candidly indicative of the
thinking of the new governor, and stand, if we
are any judge, quite contrary to the thinking
of the majority of voters in the state.
As yet, Knight has been mum as to exact po
litical plans. He has been quoted as saying
that he contemplates no immediate change in
administrative personnel or policy.
But, significantly, he has not committed him
self publicly to any long-range program, par
ticularly to one" as liberal and as broad as that
of Warren's.
Warren, throughout the United States, is rec
ognized and hailed as a liberal Republican, a
member of that wing of the GOP that fights to
keep up with the times.
Knight—if we have properly evaluated his
recent statements—is part of the "Old Guard."
And that means he most likely believes in cur
tailment of Warren's expansive social welfare
program.
Considering these differences between
Knight and his distinguished predecessor, it
would seem that —before Knight has an oppor
tunity to orient the administration to his view
point — the voters should re-emphasize what
they so eloquently expressed at the polls, their
apparent suport of Warren's magnificent pro
gram.
The voters should make emphatically clear
their stands on various important state issues—
taxes, social security, school development, and
the many others—through the many avenues
of expression open to them, the newspapers,
the various service clubs, state representatives
who are usually easy to contact.
We hope that the new governor—a Stanford
graduate, by the way—will listen to the voters,
and will review the amazing voting record
piled up in favor of Warren's bi-partisanism,
and then will act on what he discovers.

program.
Considering these differences between
Knight and his distinguished predecessor, it
would seem that —before Knight has an oppor
tunity to orient the administration to his view
point — the voters should re-emphasize what
they so eloquently expressed at the polls, their
apparent suport of Warren's magnificent pro
gram.
The voters should make emphatically clear
their stands on various important state issues—
taxes, social security, school development, and
the many others—through the many avenues
of expression open to them, the newspapers,
the various service clubs, state representatives
who are usually easy to contact.
We hope that the new governor—a Stanford
graduate, by the way—will listen to the voters,
and will review the amazing voting record
piled up in favor of Warren's bi-partisanism,
and then will act on what he discovers.
Yesterday the highest tribunal in the United
States had a new chief—California's Earl War
ren.
Yesterday, too, the highest executive seat
in California had a new occupant —Goodwin
J. Knight.
Both men possess splendid administrative
<-ind political records.
Warren—broad shouldered and big-smiling
is particularly liked and respected by the
citizenry of this state.
Apparently most Californians agree whole
heartedly that President Eisenhower made a
wise selection when he nominated Warren to
be Chief Justice.
There seems to be some trepidation, how
over, over the inevitable promotion of Knight
to the governorship.
It has been known for a long time that Knight
is the star representative in Sacramento of con
servative elements in the state, elements that
have long aimed at unseating Warren and his
liberal administration.
Knight, earlier this year, declared openly
that he would be a candidate for governor even
if Warren decided to run again.
Knight outlined frankly the general pattern
of his political philosophy Sept. 17 when he
announced his intention to campaign for gov
ernor in 1954.
He said:
"Briefly, it shall be my aim to conduct a
business-like administration with emphasis on
reduced spending. My years of experience in
Sacramento convince me that the cost of gov
ernment can be cut without jeopardizing serv
ices essential to the people."
He elaborated his views even further last
week in Berkeley, saying:
"ft is my aim to reduce bureaucracy in Cali
fornia as much as possible. Special interests
have saddled us with boards and commissions
of doubtful value."

These not-too-subtle slams at Warren and his
administration are candidly indicative of the
thinking of the new governor, and stand, if we
are any judge, quite contrary to the thinking
of the majority of voters in the state.
As yet, Knight has been mum as to exact po
litical plans. He has been quoted as saying
that he contemplates no immediate change in
administrative personnel or policy.
But, significantly, he has not committed him
self publicly to any long-range program, par
ticularly to one" as liberal and as broad as that
of Warren's.
Warren, throughout the United States, is rec
ognized and hailed as a liberal Republican, a
member of that wing of the GOP that fights to
keep up with the times.
Knight—if we have properly evaluated his
recent statements—is part of the "Old Guard."
And that means he most likely believes in cur
tailment of Warren's expansive social welfare
program.
