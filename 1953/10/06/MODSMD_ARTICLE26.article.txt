# For a Constructive Outlet

### 
For the past seventeen years, according to
tradition, the Stanford Axe has been a trophy
which goes to the winner of the annual Big
Game between Stanford and the University of
California. As the historic symbol of the long
standing rivalry between the two schools (since
March 19, 1892, the date of the first Big Game)
the old blade is carefully preserved and guard
ed by the winning school.
At UC the Axe is displayed in a showcase
in the Stephens Union. At Stanford it rests in
the Cellar in a specially designed steel cabinet
under shatter-proof glass. The cabinet is se
cured to the floor.
The reason for the extra precaution, as every
Stanfordite who is up on his Farm history
knows, lies in the fact that the Axe has been
stolen from Stanford four times since 1930.
Last June a person, or persons, purloined the
Axe from its temporary UC home, and currently
the whereabouts of the trophy is unknown, ex
cept, of course, by the person or persons who
took it.
Immediate suspicion was cast on the Farm,
for a time, it was believed that the Stanford
baseball team took the Axe to the Nationals
in Omaha. These reports have been denied
and the mystery of the Axe continues.
Frankly, we freely expected Stanford to be

placed under suspicion. Stanford hasn't had
the Axe in its possession since 1946 and there
would be good reason to believe that some
Stanford roughs simply grew tired of seeing
the Cellar showcase empty and dusty.
We noted with interest the plan of UC's sen
ior class to appoint a special Axe-finding com
mittee to try to find the Axe. Ralph Vetterlein,
president of the Associated Students of Uni
versity of California, declared that if "anyone
can find the Axe, the seniors can."
We strongTy suspect some energetic Stan
ford roughs will challenge that statement and
recover the Axe before Cal even gets a chance
to beat them to the punch. We say "energetic"
Stanford roughs because, apparently, energy
has been abounding around these parts lately.
For example, the fountain in front of the Main
Library has been turned into a teaming bub
ble bath; sidewalks in front of the Cellar and
campus dormitories have been emblazoned
with immature slogans; and a house on the
Row was attacked with watermelons and po
tatoes.
Recovering the stolen Axe, we think, offers
a splendid opportunity to channel this energy
and campus frivolity into a more constructive
outlet, namely that of bringing the Axe—and
honor—to Stanford. Bob R&zsk

ford roughs will challenge that statement and
recover the Axe before Cal even gets a chance
to beat them to the punch. We say "energetic"
Stanford roughs because, apparently, energy
has been abounding around these parts lately.
For example, the fountain in front of the Main
Library has been turned into a teaming bub
ble bath; sidewalks in front of the Cellar and
campus dormitories have been emblazoned
with immature slogans; and a house on the
Row was attacked with watermelons and po
tatoes.
Recovering the stolen Axe, we think, offers
a splendid opportunity to channel this energy
and campus frivolity into a more constructive
outlet, namely that of bringing the Axe—and
honor—to Stanford. Bob R&zsk
For the past seventeen years, according to
tradition, the Stanford Axe has been a trophy
which goes to the winner of the annual Big
Game between Stanford and the University of
California. As the historic symbol of the long
standing rivalry between the two schools (since
March 19, 1892, the date of the first Big Game)
the old blade is carefully preserved and guard
ed by the winning school.
At UC the Axe is displayed in a showcase
in the Stephens Union. At Stanford it rests in
the Cellar in a specially designed steel cabinet
under shatter-proof glass. The cabinet is se
cured to the floor.
The reason for the extra precaution, as every
Stanfordite who is up on his Farm history
knows, lies in the fact that the Axe has been
stolen from Stanford four times since 1930.
Last June a person, or persons, purloined the
Axe from its temporary UC home, and currently
the whereabouts of the trophy is unknown, ex
cept, of course, by the person or persons who
took it.
Immediate suspicion was cast on the Farm,
for a time, it was believed that the Stanford
baseball team took the Axe to the Nationals
in Omaha. These reports have been denied
and the mystery of the Axe continues.
Frankly, we freely expected Stanford to be

placed under suspicion. Stanford hasn't had
the Axe in its possession since 1946 and there
would be good reason to believe that some
Stanford roughs simply grew tired of seeing
the Cellar showcase empty and dusty.
We noted with interest the plan of UC's sen
ior class to appoint a special Axe-finding com
mittee to try to find the Axe. Ralph Vetterlein,
president of the Associated Students of Uni
versity of California, declared that if "anyone
can find the Axe, the seniors can."
We strongTy suspect some energetic Stan
ford roughs will challenge that statement and
recover the Axe before Cal even gets a chance
to beat them to the punch. We say "energetic"
