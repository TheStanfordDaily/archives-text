# BULL SESSION

### DICK MANSFIELD 
Two maggots were talking it over in the Encina
kitchen.
"I've had my fill," said one.
"Right!" said the other. "The food's okay but the
service is lousy!"
Which brings us to Encina hashers. There are hash
ers here and hashers there all over this campus. At
Encina they are different. All no doubt are otherwise
normal, but when they get into hashers' garb, they
break down into distinct classifications. For the edu-

cational value it affords to the
freshmen, here is a handy guide
1o the most common types of En
cina hasher,
1 ORDINARY HASHER—Can
and does serve mashed potatoes
in his sleep.
2. EAGER HASHER — Pork
( hop in either hand, snarls at the
shuffling frosh. to move faster,
"get the show on the road, look
alive."

3. GRASPING HASHER—Snatches your tray away
while you are still spooning your succotash.
4. SURLY HASHER—"No! You can't have your
beets and your mashed potatoes separately!"
• r > KINDLY HASHER "You don't like your lieets

mixed with your mashed potatoes? I'll put your cut
let on top so you won't have to look at them while
you're eating."
C. CO-ORDINATED HASHER—One who can al
ways come pretty close to the fried egg you want at
the first stab.
7. UNCO-ORDINATED HASHER — One who has
uncommon difficulty handing a plate of cold cuts
across the counter. Generally appointed head hasher
so he can stand and supervise, and won't be tempted
to try to work.
8. LUCKY HASHER — One who has just been
transferred to (a) Rohle or (b) punching meal tick
ets.
9. COOLIE—One who carries heavy burdens, no
tably trays of meat loaf or buckets of soup, from
dawn to dusk in response to cries from hungry frosh.
Also so-called because he receives for this labor ten
yen a day and all the mashed potatoes he can stand.
10. ESKIMO—The boy who ventures into the ice
box for more butter or milk; also he who chips away
at the ice cream with a blunt scoop. Often frostbitten.
11. ALUMNUS — Ex-hasher who carried enough
hods last summer to become independently wealthy
and retire. Among the alumni are some of the world's
happiest souls
