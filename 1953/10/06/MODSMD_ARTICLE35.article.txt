# PUNTS AND PITCHES
## Connie — The Indispensable Man 
### Pete Grothe 
One of Stanford sportsdom's most indispensable men is D. Conrad Jarvis,
•tter known as Connie. Connie is Stanford's mender of muscles, tender
ape, soother of sores. In short, he is the athletic trainer.
The amiable, well-spoken graduate of Washington State estimated that
vo years ago, he used enough tape to stretch from Stanford
i Gilroy. Last year, he figured that the white line of Johnson and Johnson
ould reach from Stanford to Salinas, about 80 miles. In the eight seasons

that Spokane-bred Connie has been here, he has used
about enough to wiggle right into the Los Angeles
Coliseum.
But Jarvis does more than just wind adhesive tape
around limbs. Ilis domain, the four rooms of the
training quarters, looks like the combination of a
hospital, the microwave lab, and the pool room be
hind Joe's Bar. The latter reference applys to the
congenial atmosphere of the quarters, as the athletes
soc-it-up while getting treatment.
At Connie's command are four whirlpool baths, one
deep circulating bath (the only one like it in the

juntry), four infra-red lamps, and one short-wave diathermy deep-heat
mp. Plus this, there is a vicious-looking double-hose which shoots a
erce blast of hot and cold water at the victim, who stands at the end of a
arrow passage. We got the treatment from Connie one clay for a ski
ijuiy and we nearly wilted on the spot. But it does wonders.
Part of Connie's job is conjuring special protective pads and harnesses
lat will prevent joints from extending to a position that would reinjure
u .n.
Several years ago, Jarvis saved a woman's life. He was eating break
ast in a Los Angeles hotel when he noticed a woman gagging. She
>vas just recovering from pneumonia and this was her first meal after
jetting up. A soup cracker was caught in her throat and she was turning
jluer and bluer. Connie rushed over and started to massage her neck.
Then, he reached down into her throat and disintegrated the cracker.
One of Connie's greatest accomplishments was putting the great George
. st into working order each week. As Connie described it,"He was
hat you would call a 'Johnson and Johnson' athlete. He had bad ankles,
vo legs which at previous times had been broken, and couldn't practice
II week. Then, on Saturdays, we would have to tightly secure him in yards
tape at just the right places, and hope for the best."
Quist made All-Coast that year, and they should have made Connie All
oast with him.
Jarvis, who was an army hospital detachment officer during the war,
. *isiders Bob Mathias the greatest athlete that he has seen at Stanford.
Bob, unlike a lot of great athletes, didn't hit his peak as a frosh or sopho
lore and then level off. He kept right on developing. As far as a pei*son
concerned, I'd like my two sons to be just as "high calibre as Bob is. I
Duldn't hope for anything more."
Jarvis was elected director of the West Coast division of trainers. Ac
cording to the coaches, the honor was indicative of Connie's ability.
Stanford team physician Fritz Roth said after the Illinois trip, "There's
c loubt about it. Connie is one of the best in the nation."
And Athletic Director A 1 Masters added, "We'd have a hard time re
lacing Connie."
A testimony to Connie's mending abilities is that not one member of
ie first two strings missed a game this fall due to injuries.

Several years ago, Jarvis saved a woman's life. He was eating break
ast in a Los Angeles hotel when he noticed a woman gagging. She
>vas just recovering from pneumonia and this was her first meal after
jetting up. A soup cracker was caught in her throat and she was turning
jluer and bluer. Connie rushed over and started to massage her neck.
Then, he reached down into her throat and disintegrated the cracker.
One of Connie's greatest accomplishments was putting the great George
. st into working order each week. As Connie described it,"He was
hat you would call a 'Johnson and Johnson' athlete. He had bad ankles,
vo legs which at previous times had been broken, and couldn't practice
II week. Then, on Saturdays, we would have to tightly secure him in yards
tape at just the right places, and hope for the best."
Quist made All-Coast that year, and they should have made Connie All
oast with him.
Jarvis, who was an army hospital detachment officer during the war,
. *isiders Bob Mathias the greatest athlete that he has seen at Stanford.
Bob, unlike a lot of great athletes, didn't hit his peak as a frosh or sopho
lore and then level off. He kept right on developing. As far as a pei*son
concerned, I'd like my two sons to be just as "high calibre as Bob is. I
Duldn't hope for anything more."
Jarvis was elected director of the West Coast division of trainers. Ac
cording to the coaches, the honor was indicative of Connie's ability.
Stanford team physician Fritz Roth said after the Illinois trip, "There's
c loubt about it. Connie is one of the best in the nation."
And Athletic Director A 1 Masters added, "We'd have a hard time re
lacing Connie."
A testimony to Connie's mending abilities is that not one member of
ie first two strings missed a game this fall due to injuries.

One of Stanford sportsdom's most indispensable men is D. Conrad Jarvis,
•tter known as Connie. Connie is Stanford's mender of muscles, tender
ape, soother of sores. In short, he is the athletic trainer.
The amiable, well-spoken graduate of Washington State estimated that
vo years ago, he used enough tape to stretch from Stanford
i Gilroy. Last year, he figured that the white line of Johnson and Johnson
ould reach from Stanford to Salinas, about 80 miles. In the eight seasons

that Spokane-bred Connie has been here, he has used
about enough to wiggle right into the Los Angeles
Coliseum.
But Jarvis does more than just wind adhesive tape
around limbs. Ilis domain, the four rooms of the
training quarters, looks like the combination of a
hospital, the microwave lab, and the pool room be
hind Joe's Bar. The latter reference applys to the
congenial atmosphere of the quarters, as the athletes
soc-it-up while getting treatment.
At Connie's command are four whirlpool baths, one
deep circulating bath (the only one like it in the

juntry), four infra-red lamps, and one short-wave diathermy deep-heat
mp. Plus this, there is a vicious-looking double-hose which shoots a
erce blast of hot and cold water at the victim, who stands at the end of a
arrow passage. We got the treatment from Connie one clay for a ski
ijuiy and we nearly wilted on the spot. But it does wonders.
Part of Connie's job is conjuring special protective pads and harnesses
lat will prevent joints from extending to a position that would reinjure
u .n.
