# Footballers Stress Conditioning In Drills for Beaver Game
## 
### 
Chuck Taylor ran his gridders
irough their most grueling Monday
'orkout since practice began,
xle punctuated practice by having
is first team run through 12 50-
ard wind sprints in quick succes
lon. Sideline observers commented
lat the tongues were hanging low-

r than they had been for a long
ime. «
The second and third strings ran
hrough a hard scrimmage, with
everal players distinguishing them

selves.
Particularly drawing the notice of
Taylor and Dutch Fehring was Tex
as Joe Long, who had just been
shifted from center to guard. Long
refused to be budged by blocking,
and stopped a lot of plays as well
as blocking, a Don Kafka pass.
Jim Truher, the fastest man on
the team, sparkled in defensive
backfield play, although Taylor
wasn't satisfied with his blocking.
Marsh Howe, who last year
played linebacker, made some dev
astating runs from his fullback po
sition, and half Bill Tarr impressed
on end sweeps.
After practice, the team retired to
the BAC to hear Mai Elwards'
scouting report on Oregon State.
The coaching staff will have a hard
time keying the team for the Bea
vers, because OSC hasn't scored a
point in three games. The OSC
game will be played in Portland,
with UCLA coming to the Farm the
following week.
The Indians suffered no serious
injuries at Illinois. However, Norm
Manoogian still isn't at peak effec
tiveness because of several leg in
juries.

—Still hobbling
