# Yankees Sweep Fifth Straight World Series
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
The Yanks took their fifth straight
World Series yesterday with a
heart-pounding 4-3 win. Billy Mar
tin, who tied numerous records with
his 12-hit Series barrage, singled in
the ninth to break up a 3-3 tie.
The Dodgers' Carl Furillo and
two mental lapses by Yankee start
er Whitey Ford almost sent the se
ries into a seventh game. Furillo
homered in the ninth with one on
off Allie Reynolds. Ford, who mod
estly admits to being one of the
greatest pitchers in the history of
the game, forgot to tag up on a long
fly to center field, enabling Dodger
starter Carl Erskine to stagger out
of a bases - loaded situation with
only one run. In the sixth Jackie
Robinson doubled and stole third
while Ford was daydreaming on the
mound. He scored on an infield out.
The Yanks opened right up on
Erskine, who was pitching with two
days' rest. Gene Woodling walked,
Hank Bauer singled, Yogi Berra
bounced a ground rule double into
the right field bleachers, and Billy
Martin lined a shot off Junior Gil
liam's glove. The scorers called it
an error, thus robbing Martin of a
new Series record. Two runs scored
in the frame.
In the second inning the Yanks
continued to pepper the shaky Er
skine. Phil Rizzuto and Whitey
Ford singled and Gene Woodling
brought in Rizzuto with a long fly.
The unnerved Erskine threw wild to
first on a routine grounder and the
bases were loaded. Berra flied deep
to left, but Ford left the base too
soon, came back, and then tried to
score. He didn't make it.
The Dodgers threatened often off
Ford, but didn't push a marker
across until Robinson scored in the
sixth. In the eighth, Stengel insert
ed his home pro, Allie Reynolds.
Reynolds sailed through the eighth,
but in the ninth. Furillo brought

cheers from Yankee Stadium to
Stern Hall as he bombed his homer.
The Dodgers' dreams died quickly,
however, as Bauer walked, Mickey
Mantle singled infield, and Martin
ripped his single into short center.
The win brought the Yanks an
unprecedented fifth straight flag,
and with all the young talent the
Bombers have, they may easily win
five more. It's difficult to see how
the present crew of Yanks could
succeed where the old powerhouses
of the late 20's and late 30\s failed.
The teams of Ruth. Gehrig, etc.,
were halted by probably the
strongest team ever assembled, the
1929-31 A's. The team of DiMaggio,
Keller, etc., only won four straight,
but don't forget they also won sev
en pennants and six series in eight
years, and they probably would
have kept winning had not the draft
pushed the ancient St. Louis
Browns and the Tigers, sparked by
a pair of 4-F's, Hal Newhouser and
Dizzy Trout, into the fore.
Those teams had their great slug
gers, but neither of those squads
had the overall balance of the pres
ent crew. Furthermore, the old
timers sing the praises of ex-Yan
kee hurlers such as Herb Pennock,
Red Ruffing, and Lefty Gomfcz. but
it's doubtful they were any better
than the present unbeatable trio of
Reynolds, Raschi, and Lopat.
Now with giants such as Ford,
Steve Kraly, and Tommy Morgan
joining the pitching staff, Mickey
Mantle due for a big year, and Ger
ry Coleman or Billy Martin ready
to spell Phil Rizzuto at shortstop,
the Yankees of about 1955 might be
the greatest team of them all.
