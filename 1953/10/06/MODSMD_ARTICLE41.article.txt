"We used to heat somebody when
we scored 21 points," said Chuck
Taylor to the weekly Northern
California football writers' lunch
eon yesterday. "Now it seems that
nobody can win with 21."
"I'm just informed that this is the
first time in California gridiron his
tory that a Bear team has scored
21 points and lost the game," said
Coach Pappy Waldorf.
Taylor said that the Illinois club
he met didn't compare with the
team that whipped Stanford in the
Rose Bowl at the end of the 1951
season.
"This Illinois team is good, but it
is not the team we met in the Rose
Bowl," said Taylor. "It doesn't
charge nearly as hard—and it is not
nearly as fast."
Taylor pointed out, however, that
the Illin* had a vjery fine back in

/
w
J. C. Caroline.
"That boy just made our tacklers
look bad," said Taylor. "We aren't
a great tackling team, but we aren't
bad either. Caroline is just hard to
hang onto . I would say our teams
were equal except for Caroline "
