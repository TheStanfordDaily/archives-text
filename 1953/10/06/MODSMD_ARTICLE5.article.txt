# Turkey Gets Seat

UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. —Tur-
key defeated Communist Poland to
day in a sizzling contest for election
to the United Nations Security
Council in which Soviet delegate
Andrei Y. Vishinsky shouted on
after being cut off the loudspeaker
system.
The decision came on the eighth
ballot with American-backed Tur
key mustering exactly the two
thirds majority—4o votes—needed
for election. Poland received 19
votes.
Vishinsky Out of Turn
The balloting came after Vishin
sky, the day's only speaker, ignored
the verbal and gaveled protests of
General Assembly President Mrs.
Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit that he was
out of order and completed a speech
electioneering for Poland.
Though off the loudspeaker sys
tem, the one-time purge trials pros
ecutor argued that rejection of Po
land would be a violation of the
U.N. charter, the rules of procedure,
and the so - called "gentleman's
agreement" of 1946 allocating scats
on the 11-nation Council by blocs.
The U.S. has maintained for some
time that the agreement held only
for the first year.
Bloc System Followed
Still, in the elections to fill the
other two Council scats slated to be
vacated Jan. 1, the bloc system was
followed. On the very first ballot,
Brazil was elected to replacc Chile
for a two-year term in a South
American seat with 56 votes. And
New Zealand succeeded Pakistan
in a seat customarily reserved for
the British Commonwealth with 48
votes.
Actually, there was a three-way
race for the third seat, now held by
Greece, with the Philippines also a
candidate. (The Big Five veto-hold
ing powers hold seats on the 11-na

tion Council permanently; the other
six are rotated among the other 55
U.N. members in two-year install
ments.)
