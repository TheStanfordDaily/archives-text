# Knowland vs. Pact
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct." 5 â€” Senate
Republican Leader William F.
Knowland said today it would be
a "mistake" to join with Russia in
any non-aggression pact until free
elections have been held behind the
Iron Curtain.
Knowland, who just returned
from a world tour, said signing such
a pact without free elections in
Communist - controlled countries
would "permanently condemn the
people of those nations to Soviet
tyranny."
The administration is considering
offering Russia a non - aggression
pact in an effort to find out if Rus
sia really wants peace and to end
Soviet stalling on the German and
Austrian peace treaties.
Officials have stressed, however,
that the matter is only under con
sideration and that no decisions
have been reached.
