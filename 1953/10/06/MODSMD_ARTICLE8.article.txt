# ROK Calls Riots
## 
### 
MUNSAN, Tuesday, Oct. 6â€”Mass
demonstrations were called through
out South Korea today to demand
the release of 22,500 anti-Commu
nist war prisoners, underlining a
bold ROK government threat to free
them by force.
Should the ROK cuup materialize,
Allied officers feared fighting would
break out between ROK troops and
United Nations forces, including
Americans, bound by the armistice
agreement to protect the neutral In
dian soldiers.
Peiping radio warned that a mass
escape would "blow the truce to
pieces." It accused the United States
of scheming to "abduct" the pris
oners and said plots to free the pris
oners were being hatched by "spe
cial agents" smuggled into the POW
camps.
The Indian camp was reported
tense, with ROK marines stationed
only a few miles away.
