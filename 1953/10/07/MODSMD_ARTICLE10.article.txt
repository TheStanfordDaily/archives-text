## Journalist Stresses Need For 'Government of Unity' 
### DON WEBSTER 
"If Russia has the hydrogen bomb, and I see no reason to believe
she has not, then we ought to have a government of national unity
at once, composed of the ablest men of both political parties."
Thus Bruce Bliven, famed author and chairman of the editorial
board of New Republic, expressed his feelings toward the cur-

rent political situation. He was on
campus to speak last night at the
Tuesday "Evening Series.
"It is absurd for our leaders to
bicker over political partisanship if
the international peril is as serious
as it seems to be."
Bliven likened the situation to a
sinking ship with the crew arguing
among themselves instead of helping
repair the damage. The time for bi
partisanship is now, he said.
A Stanford graduate, Bliven has
visited many college campuses in the
east and midwest. Besides New Re
public, he has written for many
other magazines including Saturday
Evening Post and Harpers.
"In my last Post editorial (Sept. 5
issue), I urged that the many anti-
American charges that have ap
peared in foreign magazines be an
swered. There has never been an
organized drive by the State Depart
ment to make retaliatory information
available. Since the editorial I have
had a gratifying number of letters

agreeing that something should be
done."
Some of Bliven's activities when at
Stanford are unusual. He arrived in
1907, the year after the earthquake,
graduate work at Cornell.

said. "Students made money in their
spare time by scraping brick. I lived
both in College Terrace and Encina.
Encina was a four-year dormitory at
the time, so there was always a
struggle to get into Encina."
He majored in English (there was
no journalism) and was editor of
the Chaparral for half a year. Dur
ing the summers he worked for the
old San Francisco Bulletin.

Thus Bruce Bliven, famed author and chairman of the editorial
board of New Republic, expressed his feelings toward the cur-

rent political situation. He was on
campus to speak last night at the
Tuesday "Evening Series.
"It is absurd for our leaders to
bicker over political partisanship if
the international peril is as serious
as it seems to be."
Bliven likened the situation to a
sinking ship with the crew arguing
among themselves instead of helping
repair the damage. The time for bi
partisanship is now, he said.
A Stanford graduate, Bliven has
visited many college campuses in the
east and midwest. Besides New Re

said. "Students made money in their

both in College Terrace and Encina.
Encina was a four-year dormitory at
the time, so there was always a
struggle to get into Encina."
He majored in English (there was
no journalism) and was editor of
the Chaparral for half a year. Dur
ing the summers he worked for the
old San Francisco Bulletin.
