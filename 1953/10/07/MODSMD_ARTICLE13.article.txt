### BILL WRIGHT 
Surveying broadly the strong
points and the shortcomings of the
media of mass communication,
Bruce Bliven, author and journal- I
ism expert, opened the Tuesday
Evening Series lectures last night
in Memorial Hall.
Under the topic "Is Our Press
Doing Its Job?" Bliven, Stanford
alumnus and now an editorial di
rector for the New Republic, en
tertainingly considered the prob
lems of reporting by newspapers,
magazines, radio, television, and J
movies.
Bliven discussed the popular crit
icisms of the American press, see
ing both the good and bad sides of
the questions of control by big busi
ness, syndicates, and ownership
chains.
He reproved the current press for
failing to be sufficiently critical of
the Republican administration, say
ing, "It is dangerous for the Presi
dent and for the country as a whole
for the press to glide over the faults
and stress only the good points."
Bliven called the press the "eyes
and the ears of the citizens" and
regretted that two - thirds of the
press did not have any freedom of
the press. "It's a gloomy picture,"
he said.
"Comparing the good American
papers with the good foreign pa
pers and the bad American papers
with their foreign counterparts," he
stated, "it seems to me the Ameri
can press is now the best in the
world."
He commended the press because
"It's enormously better than it was
40 or 50 years ago."
