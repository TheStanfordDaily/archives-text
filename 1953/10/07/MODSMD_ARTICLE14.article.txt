# "Back to Farm' Exhibits Show Sports Relics
## 
### 
i The red jersey is faded, and the
white numeral one doesn't look
very terrifying through the show
case glass. But just ask anyone who
was around in 192(5, and they'll tell
you all about the greatest Stanford
football player of them all and the
number one jersey he immortalized.
J Ernie Ncvers.
This is Back to the Farm Week
at Stanford, a week lor traditions,
| a pause to remember. And in the
main lobby of the library Ernie
Nevers jet*sey, the only one ever
| retired at Stanford, is on display.
In the showcase opposite it is the
I announcement of the first Big
i Game, March 19, 18?)2.
Hilled as "The Harvard and
Yale of the Pacific Coast," Stan- I
ford and Cal met in the Haight
I Street Baseball Grounds in San !
Francisco. This was the game
when nobody remembered to I
bring n football.
Pictures on exhibit include shots
j ol a grim-faced physical education
! coed modeling a long, black, baggy,
bloomer - type gym suit. Another
! scene shows the first varsity foot
j ball team back in 1894, with Her-
I bert Hoover, treasurer of the stu
| dent body, in the back row.
At Hoover Library other pictures
j and books tell the history of the
] people who have been a part of
i Stanford. Writings and photographs,
from Herbert Hoover's personal col
| lection have been arranged by his
! secretary, Mrs. McMullin.
Pictures of the Stanford family
and early scenes of the University
I are posted on History and Engi
i neering Corners.
