# Governor Gives Outline of Policy
## 
### HADLEY ROFF Editor, The Daily 
"I will not tolerate in my ad
ministration the St. Vitus Dance
of crack-pot theories and danger
ous radicalism, but at the same
time I reject the rigor mortis of
reaction and of the people who
believe social betterment must
not be embraced by govern
ment."
In these words California's new
governor—broad shouldered, silver
haired Goodwin J. Knight—described
his political views when asked by
The Daily yesterday in San Fran
cisco.
In a private, off-the-cuff interview,
the Stanford graduate (class of '19)
and former Lieutenant Governor,
said it will be his policy to try to
avoid playing '"two sides or three
sides" or favoring any one partisan
group when considering govern
mental action.
"I have a profound conviction,"
he said, "that the doctrine of in
dividual liberty and personal free
dom shall prevail. This doctrine—
or policy—is the one which says
that the most obscure boy or girl in
our state or the most poverty
stricken man or woman shall not
be handicapped by any artificial
barrier such as politics, race, re
ligion, or conviction."
Knight, who while at Stanford was
a joke writer for Chapparal and a
member of the Alpha Delta Phi fra
ternity, was sworn in Monday as
the .'slst Governor of the State. His
term will hold until the next general
election, which is next year. At that
lime he will formally campaign for
the office,

He was elevated to the chief ex
ecutive's position upon the resigna
tion of Earl Warren who has been
appointed Chief Justice by President
Eisenhower. Knight had served as
lieutenant governor since 194(>.
In recalling his days tin the Farm
yesterday, the easy smiling official
told of his work on Chappie and 011
the Illustrated Review, then the
alumni publication. While here he !
was enrolled in Sigma Delta Chi.
' the professional journalism soc
i iety.
Upon graduation, he entered Col- j
| umbia University where he did
graduate work. During World War 11
I he saw service aboard submarines. 1
He was admitted to the bar in I
| 1921, and in 1935 he was appointed
a superior judge of j-ios Angeles
J County by then Governor Frank F.
I Merriam.
Knight's promotion marks him as
! the first Stanford grad ever to serve
1 as governor of the Golden State.
In discussing this fact, he pointed
j out that three Stanfordites had
| served as lieutenant governor, him
! self. George Juan Hatfield (a Repub
! lie an. who served in that office from
1935 to 1938), and Ellis E. Patterson
I (a Democrat, who served from 1939
I to 1943).
He pointed out too that Stanford
can count among its alumni a pies- J
ident of the United States. Herbert j
Hoover.
While in San Francisco, Knight
conferred with Vice President Rich
ard Nixon, who stopped off in the
I city before enplaning on an exten-
I sive tour of the Far and Middle
East, and Senate Majority Leader
William F. Knowland—both native
j sons.
Both Nixon and Knowland re
j vealed that they intend to support
Knight in the coming election. There
was a rumor earlier this week that
there was a deep split between the
Knight and Knowland political fac
j lions, but this was discounted b> the
governor ami the senator yesterday.

ment."
In these words California's new
governor—broad shouldered, silver
haired Goodwin J. Knight—described
his political views when asked by
The Daily yesterday in San Fran
cisco.
In a private, off-the-cuff interview,
the Stanford graduate (class of '19)
and former Lieutenant Governor,
said it will be his policy to try to
avoid playing '"two sides or three
sides" or favoring any one partisan
group when considering govern
mental action.
"I have a profound conviction,"
he said, "that the doctrine of in
dividual liberty and personal free
dom shall prevail. This doctrine—
or policy—is the one which says
that the most obscure boy or girl in
our state or the most poverty
stricken man or woman shall not
be handicapped by any artificial
barrier such as politics, race, re
ligion, or conviction."
Knight, who while at Stanford was
a joke writer for Chapparal and a
member of the Alpha Delta Phi fra
ternity, was sworn in Monday as
the .'slst Governor of the State. His
term will hold until the next general
election, which is next year. At that
lime he will formally campaign for
the office,

He was elevated to the chief ex
ecutive's position upon the resigna
tion of Earl Warren who has been
appointed Chief Justice by President
Eisenhower. Knight had served as
lieutenant governor since 194(>.
In recalling his days tin the Farm
yesterday, the easy smiling official
told of his work on Chappie and 011
the Illustrated Review, then the
alumni publication. While here he !
was enrolled in Sigma Delta Chi.
' the professional journalism soc
i iety.
Upon graduation, he entered Col- j
| umbia University where he did
graduate work. During World War 11
I he saw service aboard submarines. 1
He was admitted to the bar in I
| 1921, and in 1935 he was appointed
a superior judge of j-ios Angeles
J County by then Governor Frank F.
I Merriam.
Knight's promotion marks him as
! the first Stanford grad ever to serve
1 as governor of the Golden State.
In discussing this fact, he pointed
j out that three Stanfordites had
| served as lieutenant governor, him
! self. George Juan Hatfield (a Repub
! lie an. who served in that office from
1935 to 1938), and Ellis E. Patterson
I (a Democrat, who served from 1939
I to 1943).
He pointed out too that Stanford
can count among its alumni a pies- J
ident of the United States. Herbert j
Hoover.
While in San Francisco, Knight
conferred with Vice President Rich
ard Nixon, who stopped off in the
I city before enplaning on an exten-
I sive tour of the Far and Middle
East, and Senate Majority Leader
William F. Knowland—both native
j sons.
Both Nixon and Knowland re
j vealed that they intend to support
Knight in the coming election. There
was a rumor earlier this week that
there was a deep split between the
Knight and Knowland political fac
j lions, but this was discounted b> the
governor ami the senator yesterday.
"I will not tolerate in my ad
ministration the St. Vitus Dance
of crack-pot theories and danger
ous radicalism, but at the same

reaction and of the people who
believe social betterment must
not be embraced by govern
