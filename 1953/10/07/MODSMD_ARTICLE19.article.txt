# Non-Aggression Treaty Seen Possible by Dulles
## U.S.-Russian Agreement Sought to Ease Tensions 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. (I flJl'i
Secretary of State John Fo !..-f
Dulles said today the United St..•,
might be willing to sign some . •»i i.
of non-aggression pact with Ru m
to calm any Soviet fears over \V< L
German rearmament.
Dulles emphasized at a news cOl •
ference, however, that no detail
have been worked out and that such
a step is only one of a variety of
ways being considered to ease world
tensions.
From his remarks it seemed ap
parent that any U.S. move toward >
pact would be made in concert wii
other Western powers, and tint
any such agreement might apply to
Korea and Austria as well as Get -
many.
Dulles' guarded comment was the
first from a high administration offi
cial on the possibility of a new non
aggression pact.
Speculation over the plan ha
been brisk since Democratic leader
Adlai E. Stevenson said after a con
ference with President Eisenhower
last week that the idea was be in-,
studied. Later, Senate Republican
Leader William F. Knowland said
he had discussed it with Mr. Eisen
hower.
Knowland also put the admini -
tration on notice that it might run
into trouble from Congress if it
tried to negotiate such a pact before
free elections are held in Iron Cur
tain countries.
Dulles made it clear he believe .
he is not in any fundamental di •
agreement with Knowland on th"
need for self-determination by Hv
satellite nations. But he did not "/>
so far as to agree with the Califor •
nia Senator's declaration that free
elections in Eastern Europe should
precede any non - aggression pa< t.
with Russia.
In his discussion with reporter
Dulles explained the situation llii ,
way:
The United Nations charter call .
on all member nations to refrain
from the threat or use of force
against each other. Dulles said it
would seem difficult to go beyond
that.
Furthermore, the proposed Euro
pean defense community which en
visions West German rearmament i
by its nature non-aggressive.
However, Russia might requin
further reassurances and this might
make non - aggression guarant' <
desirable. But Dulles stressed thai
the United States would not mal*<
any concrete concessions in return
for mere Russian promises unles; it
receives firm assurances that the
promises will be honored.
The Secretary seemed to thin!
there is less chance of the Soviet
fearing any aggression from Korea
or Austria, the other two place
where Communist and non-Corn
munist forces rub shoulders. Ho
ever, he said the United State ,
would "be glad" to erase any su •
picions.
