# Open Book Stacks: Use Them Correctly
## 
### 
The opening of the library stacks in the Main
Library this quarter marks a welcome change
in policy. Gone, for the undergrad, are the
days of waiting al the desk for books and
fighting the red tape in order to enter the prec
ious sanctuary.
Thanks to the Faculty Library Committee —
a committee representing the very people
most liable to suffer under the n£w liberal
policy —students of all class standing may
now browse and study in the stacks without
having to obtain special permission.
To freely enter the stacks and have access
to the main bulk of the University's books is
a trust and a privilege which will last only
until it is abused.
If students start to borrow books without

signing for them, if they misplace the books
they use while in the stacks, if they use the
stacks as a setting for bull sessions or other
noise-making, then the privilege will be re
voked
And this is only fair. For the library as
well as having the job of supplying books to
students, also has (he duty of answering to
the University for the financial loss incurred
when books are lost, stolen, or defaced.
The responsibility of maintaining order in
the stacks is up to you. Learn the few simple
rules of handling books in the stacks and obey
them. It only takes a few uncooperative stu
dents to put everyone back on the red tape
system.
