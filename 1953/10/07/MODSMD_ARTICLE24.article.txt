# CAMPUS OPINION
## Thanks to All Concerned 
### 
To the Editor:
We would like to thank all concerned for their
fine work and co-operation which resulted in one
of Stanford's best-attended Keg dances. In particular
we would like to express thanks to Barbara Green,
dance chairman; the patrons, Dr. and Mrs. Wert and
Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Coulombe; and the Ram's Head
entertainers. We are also grateful to Miss Adele
Strogen and Mr. Brad Blaine, our advisers, for their
much-needed help and encouragement over the in
evitable rough spots.
Our clubs are proud to have had the responsibility
of opening this year's campus social calendar with a
bang. The profits have been more than financial. The

fact that we had the job of pooling the ideas and
efforts of two separate organizations into a complete
social function resulted in a heck of a lot of fun and
a spirit of cohesiveness which is going to mean a
lot in the year to come. We strongly encourage any
organization which is looking for fun and activity as
well as a good way to make money, to put on such an
affair.
Thank you all for coming.
