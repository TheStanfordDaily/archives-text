# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Things weren't quite the same on campi* yester
day.
It started a few nights ago when a grad student
walked out of the main libe. He had been studying
upstairs and had been blinded by all the new lights
they'd put in up there. Thus, when he passed the

111 V* piH <11 Vp W.WIV.. YW»*.
fountain in front of the libe and ,
and thought he saw soap suds
there, he wrote it off to the bright
lights.
The next morning at 7 a.m. a
grounds keeper passed the same
fountain. He had been drunk
the night before and was feeling
like most people feel who are
drunk the night before. lie too
passed the fountain. He thought
he saw huge, billowy soap suds

in the fountain with Lake Louise-blue water under
neath.
"It's those D.T.'s again," he screamed, as he ran off
for inner-Quad to throw himself in the IBM ma
chine and end it all.
Then, the ten minutes to eight bell rang. Others
passed the fountain. A Roble girl tittered. A Delt
guffawed. An engineering prof snickered. A speech
and drama major started to sing, "I'm Forever Blow
ing Bubbles."
Pretty soon the whole campus knew about it.
Crowds gathered around the fountain in front of

the main libe to gawk at the billowy soap suds and
the Lake Louise-blue water underneath. The cam
pus had a new topic of conversation. "Did you have
a nice summer?" and "How much plus did you go?"
were getting stale. Now. a student could query in
dramatic tones, "Say. didia see the bubbles and the
blue water in the fountain?"
Roff, the chief rooster at the Daily, dispatched four
fumbling photogs to get a.shot. The Chappie gagmen
planned photo features around the display. And grad
students even emerged from the stacks long enough
to observe the phenomenon.
The day passed, and darkness obscured the campus.
Chief Gordy Davis called for his top five investigators
to find out who done it. Five black police cars
Fordomaticed to five different houses. A knock on
the door, a dark figure sliding in the entrance, a light
flicking on, a shade snapped down, five minutes later
a dark figure slipping out again—Gordy's men were
on the trail.
Meanwhile, the chem department was called in.
Ten teaching assistants analyzed the soap suds.
Was it I)uz, Dreft. or Rinso? The answer would soon
be known. Don Lo/.abnick. the people's cherce,
organized a committee to investigate.
The subject was under thorough scrutiny. But
still the crowds continue to gawk at the billowy suds
and the Lake Louise-blue water.

blue water in the fountain?"
Roff, the chief rooster at the Daily, dispatched four
fumbling photogs to get a.shot. The Chappie gagmen
planned photo features around the display. And grad
students even emerged from the stacks long enough
to observe the phenomenon.
The day passed, and darkness obscured the campus.
Chief Gordy Davis called for his top five investigators
to find out who done it. Five black police cars
Fordomaticed to five different houses. A knock on
the door, a dark figure sliding in the entrance, a light
flicking on, a shade snapped down, five minutes later
a dark figure slipping out again—Gordy's men were
on the trail.
Meanwhile, the chem department was called in.
Ten teaching assistants analyzed the soap suds.
Was it I)uz, Dreft. or Rinso? The answer would soon
be known. Don Lo/.abnick. the people's cherce,
organized a committee to investigate.
The subject was under thorough scrutiny. But
still the crowds continue to gawk at the billowy suds
and the Lake Louise-blue water.

Things weren't quite the same on campi* yester
day.
It started a few nights ago when a grad student
walked out of the main libe. He had been studying
upstairs and had been blinded by all the new lights
they'd put in up there. Thus, when he passed the

fountain in front of the libe and ,
and thought he saw soap suds
there, he wrote it off to the bright
lights.
The next morning at 7 a.m. a
grounds keeper passed the same
fountain. He had been drunk
the night before and was feeling
like most people feel who are
drunk the night before. lie too
passed the fountain. He thought
he saw huge, billowy soap suds

in the fountain with Lake Louise-blue water under
neath.
"It's those D.T.'s again," he screamed, as he ran off
for inner-Quad to throw himself in the IBM ma
chine and end it all.
Then, the ten minutes to eight bell rang. Others
passed the fountain. A Roble girl tittered. A Delt
guffawed. An engineering prof snickered. A speech
and drama major started to sing, "I'm Forever Blow
ing Bubbles."
Pretty soon the whole campus knew about it.
Crowds gathered around the fountain in front of

the main libe to gawk at the billowy soap suds and
the Lake Louise-blue water underneath. The cam
pus had a new topic of conversation. "Did you have
a nice summer?" and "How much plus did you go?"
were getting stale. Now. a student could query in
dramatic tones, "Say. didia see the bubbles and the
