# Soccer Outlook Bright; Squad Opens Season Here Saturday Against CCSF
## 
### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
With just a little more than a week of practice under their belts, the Stanford varsity soccer
team opens the season next Saturday morning against City College of San Francisco on the Stan
ford soccer field. lust how do the red and whitebooters, who rolled up a six won, two lost, one
tied record last year best in the school's historyâ€” shape up for this year?
Coach Leo Weinstein is optimistic. He is confident that his team will equal or better the mark

t.iade by last year's team, which *
managed t.o tic the perennial champ,
USF. 1-1, thus snapping the city,
hooters 42-game winning streak.
Weinstein has good reason to be j
confident. He had an unusually |
large turnout of approximately 30
men for tin- first day's practice last
Thursday. Included in the turnout
were eight lettermcn, a large and
very essential group of foreign stu- 1
dents, several jayvee players from '
last year, a few promising freshmen,
and a trio of transfer students from !
San Francisco State.
Coach Weinstein had hoped to :
have Ken Woods of last year's club I
back at goalie; however, Ken in
jured a knee in track last spring. '
Fred Frye, ;i good, hustling ball
player up from the jayvee squad,
will probably be between the posts
next Saturday.
At fullback Weinstein seems to be I
well stocked. He has a couple of
two-year veterans operating there, i
namely John Sentous and John
Hannah. Behind them is Ted Wil
son. from Pomona, who has several
seasons of college ball behind him. !
1)< rek Liecty. who should be the j
best center halfback in the league,
will be back at the all-important I
central post on two healthy legs. 1
Sam IJegistar, another two - year \
n An will be at right half, while Don
Yati 11)> from the jayvees, and Pe

ter Mack, captain at Midland Prep
last year, are battling for the left
half post.
It is in the line where losses from
last year are the heaviest. Fortu
nately, several of the outstanding
newcomers are forwards. Sam Sua
rez, last year's outstanding play
maker and second high scorer, is
back at left inside. Neil Vinding,
from Denmark, gives the team un

usual strength at the difficult left
wing position. The trio from San
Fr a ncis c o State, Bob Couture,
Chuck Andrews, and Tom Hansen,
will probably comprise the center
and right side of the line. Andrews,
incidentally, was the Ail-American
right inside last year.
The afore-mentioned players in
addition to several others comprise
what should be a very strong team.
