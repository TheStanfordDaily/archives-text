There are seven men to a squad—
three forwards, three guards, and
one goalie—who are trying to score
with a ball into a screen 10 feet wide
and three feet high guarded by the
opposing goalie. If a player com
mits lour personal fouls he is out
for the remainder of the game. If
a player swims within the four
yard restraining line with the ball
and scores, the point is not allowed.
The player must receive the ball
while in the four-yard limit, or
stop, drop it across the line, and re
cover it to rack up a point. A vio
lation like this is considered a tech
nical foul and does not count to
ward personal fouls. The game is
divided into four quarters of seven
minutes each.
