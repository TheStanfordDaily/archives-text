# History, Why's of Campus Architecture Revealed in Leland Stanford's Reports

"The University's architecture
is as timely and as timeless as
the weather," commented Fred
erick Glover, assistant to Presi
dent Sterling, in a Stanford
Alumni Review article on the
campus architecture.
For a more detailed look at the
"why's" of the buildings students
are spending years in—why sand
stone? why no turf ori Inner Quad?
why red - tiled roofs? — Glover
looked to early reports to Senator
Leland Stanford about his plans for
building a university.
The first plans were drawn up by
Boston architects, Shelpley, Rutan,
and Coolidge, in 1880, incorporating
suggestions made to Stanford at his
request by General Francis A.
Walker. Initial construction of 13
highly uniform one-story buildings
was recommended by Walker.
. Wi|h proper architec
tural treatment, buildings of this
character, made of massive rough
stone, connected by an arcade,
may be made singularly effective
and picturesque . . . was the
opinion expressed by the general.
Walker's recommendation that the
buildings be fitted to the topography
and climate peculiar to California
was also stressed by Frederick Law
Olmstead, who in 1888 contributed
his suggestions to Stanford and par
tially revised Walker's plan.
"If we are to look for types of
buildings and arrangements suit
able to the climate of California it
will rather be in those founded by
the wiser men of Syria, Greece,
Italy, and Spain," stated Olmstead.
As a result of the years of
building and rebuilding, eight
distinct styles of architecture may
he identified on this campus.
The original architectural style,
Richardsonian Romanesque, is ex
emplified in the Inner Quadrangle
and the Art Gallery. Twenty-six
buildings follow this style of short
columns with decoratcd capitals and
half - circle arches, developed by
Henry Hobbs Richardson.
Outer Quad, the Post Office, En
cina. Chemistry Building, and the
original Roble (now Sequoia) arc

among the 1" examples of Victorian
Romanesque architecture.

Classical Revival is the archi
tect's term for the style of the
Museum, Anatomy, and Bacteri
ology buildings. Reinforced con
crete surfaced with stucco was
used in their construction, and
added motifs were derived from
the Victorian concept of Greek,
Egyptian, and Roman styles.
The campus total of 104 buildings
includes only one of Victorian ar
chitecture and one Colonial. Wood
pecker Lodge, the gray frame and
shingle building in back of the
Quad offices, was built in the Vic
torian style in 1895 to serve as the
Women's Gymnasium. The Colonial
building is of course the Firehouse,
built in 15)02.
Seven more of the buildings were
designed along the lines of Califor
nia Spanish, including the Men's
and Women's Clubhouses and the
Cellar.
In the group of six Contemporary
buildings Stern Hall, the Microwave
Lab, and the Electronics Research
Lab are easily identified.
The Pavilion, Main Library,
Toyon, Branncr, Lagunita Court,
and Education Building all fall
under the classification of Trans
itional architecture. Twenty-four
of the campus buildings belong in
this category.
The Unclassified division claims
the remaining 22 structures, their
common trait being a lack of dis
tinct architectural style.
As the decades have passed since

the nucleus of the University was
planned by Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford, University architects have met
the problem of planning Contempo- j
rary structures that will blend with |
those of 1891 by formulating six
premises in place of a master plan. ,
One of these six, as stated in 1947 j
by Eldridge Spencer, Director of
Planning, is:
"Architectural unity will be!
achieved by form, not by recreat- j
ing former styles."
Hoover Tower, Education Build
ing, and Stern Hall are but a few
illustrations of these premises in op
eration.


IN THE BEGlNNlNG—Standstone quarried near San lose and
the picturesque red tiles were combined to build Stanford Uni
versity back in 1888-91. The picture above shows the manner of
building the arches and walls of Inner Quad and sections of the
tiled roofs. This first portion of the University follows the

Richardsonian Romanesque architectural style, typified by short
columns with decorated capitals, half-circle arches, the use of
a veneer of rough sandstone over the brick walls, and pitched
roofs. The University now numbers 104 buildings and includes
illustrations of eight different architectural styles.

"The University's architecture
is as timely and as timeless as
the weather," commented Fred
erick Glover, assistant to Presi
dent Sterling, in a Stanford
Alumni Review article on the
campus architecture.

looked to early reports to Senator
Leland Stanford about his plans for
building a university.
The first plans were drawn up by
Boston architects, Shelpley, Rutan,
and Coolidge, in 1880, incorporating
suggestions made to Stanford at his
request by General Francis A.
Walker. Initial construction of 13
highly uniform one-story buildings
was recommended by Walker.
. Wi|h proper architec
tural treatment, buildings of this
character, made of massive rough
stone, connected by an arcade,
may be made singularly effective
and picturesque . . . was the
opinion expressed by the general.
Walker's recommendation that the
buildings be fitted to the topography
and climate peculiar to California
was also stressed by Frederick Law
Olmstead, who in 1888 contributed
his suggestions to Stanford and par
tially revised Walker's plan.
"If we are to look for types of
buildings and arrangements suit
able to the climate of California it
will rather be in those founded by
the wiser men of Syria, Greece,
Italy, and Spain," stated Olmstead.
As a result of the years of
building and rebuilding, eight
distinct styles of architecture may
he identified on this campus.
The original architectural style,
Richardsonian Romanesque, is ex
emplified in the Inner Quadrangle
and the Art Gallery. Twenty-six
buildings follow this style of short
columns with decoratcd capitals and
half - circle arches, developed by
Henry Hobbs Richardson.
Outer Quad, the Post Office, En
cina. Chemistry Building, and the
original Roble (now Sequoia) arc

among the 1" examples of Victorian
Romanesque architecture.

Classical Revival is the archi
tect's term for the style of the
Museum, Anatomy, and Bacteri
ology buildings. Reinforced con
crete surfaced with stucco was
used in their construction, and
added motifs were derived from
the Victorian concept of Greek,
Egyptian, and Roman styles.
The campus total of 104 buildings
includes only one of Victorian ar
chitecture and one Colonial. Wood
pecker Lodge, the gray frame and
shingle building in back of the
Quad offices, was built in the Vic
torian style in 1895 to serve as the
Women's Gymnasium. The Colonial
building is of course the Firehouse,
built in 15)02.
Seven more of the buildings were
designed along the lines of Califor
nia Spanish, including the Men's
and Women's Clubhouses and the
Cellar.
In the group of six Contemporary
buildings Stern Hall, the Microwave
Lab, and the Electronics Research
Lab are easily identified.
The Pavilion, Main Library,
Toyon, Branncr, Lagunita Court,
and Education Building all fall
under the classification of Trans
itional architecture. Twenty-four
of the campus buildings belong in
this category.
The Unclassified division claims
the remaining 22 structures, their
common trait being a lack of dis
tinct architectural style.
As the decades have passed since

the nucleus of the University was
planned by Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford, University architects have met
the problem of planning Contempo- j
rary structures that will blend with |
those of 1891 by formulating six
premises in place of a master plan. ,
One of these six, as stated in 1947 j
by Eldridge Spencer, Director of
Planning, is:
"Architectural unity will be!
achieved by form, not by recreat- j
ing former styles."
Hoover Tower, Education Build
ing, and Stern Hall are but a few
illustrations of these premises in op
eration.

roofs. The University now numbers 104 buildings and includes
illustrations of eight different architectural styles.
"The University's architecture
is as timely and as timeless as
the weather," commented Fred
erick Glover, assistant to Presi
dent Sterling, in a Stanford
Alumni Review article on the
campus architecture.
For a more detailed look at the
"why's" of the buildings students
are spending years in—why sand

why red - tiled roofs? — Glover
looked to early reports to Senator
Leland Stanford about his plans for
building a university.
The first plans were drawn up by
Boston architects, Shelpley, Rutan,
and Coolidge, in 1880, incorporating
suggestions made to Stanford at his
request by General Francis A.
Walker. Initial construction of 13
highly uniform one-story buildings
was recommended by Walker.
. Wi|h proper architec
tural treatment, buildings of this
character, made of massive rough
stone, connected by an arcade,
may be made singularly effective
and picturesque . . . was the
opinion expressed by the general.
Walker's recommendation that the
buildings be fitted to the topography
and climate peculiar to California
was also stressed by Frederick Law
Olmstead, who in 1888 contributed
his suggestions to Stanford and par
tially revised Walker's plan.
"If we are to look for types of
buildings and arrangements suit
able to the climate of California it
will rather be in those founded by
the wiser men of Syria, Greece,
Italy, and Spain," stated Olmstead.
As a result of the years of
building and rebuilding, eight
distinct styles of architecture may
he identified on this campus.
The original architectural style,
Richardsonian Romanesque, is ex
emplified in the Inner Quadrangle
and the Art Gallery. Twenty-six
buildings follow this style of short
columns with decoratcd capitals and
half - circle arches, developed by
Henry Hobbs Richardson.
Outer Quad, the Post Office, En
cina. Chemistry Building, and the
original Roble (now Sequoia) arc

among the 1" examples of Victorian
Romanesque architecture.

Classical Revival is the archi
tect's term for the style of the
Museum, Anatomy, and Bacteri
ology buildings. Reinforced con
crete surfaced with stucco was
used in their construction, and
added motifs were derived from
the Victorian concept of Greek,
Egyptian, and Roman styles.
The campus total of 104 buildings
includes only one of Victorian ar
chitecture and one Colonial. Wood
pecker Lodge, the gray frame and
shingle building in back of the
Quad offices, was built in the Vic
torian style in 1895 to serve as the
Women's Gymnasium. The Colonial
building is of course the Firehouse,
built in 15)02.
Seven more of the buildings were
designed along the lines of Califor
nia Spanish, including the Men's
and Women's Clubhouses and the
Cellar.
In the group of six Contemporary
buildings Stern Hall, the Microwave
Lab, and the Electronics Research
Lab are easily identified.
The Pavilion, Main Library,
Toyon, Branncr, Lagunita Court,
and Education Building all fall
under the classification of Trans
itional architecture. Twenty-four
of the campus buildings belong in
this category.
The Unclassified division claims
the remaining 22 structures, their
common trait being a lack of dis
tinct architectural style.
As the decades have passed since

the nucleus of the University was
planned by Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford, University architects have met
the problem of planning Contempo- j
rary structures that will blend with |
those of 1891 by formulating six
premises in place of a master plan. ,
One of these six, as stated in 1947 j
by Eldridge Spencer, Director of
Planning, is:
"Architectural unity will be!
achieved by form, not by recreat- j
ing former styles."
Hoover Tower, Education Build
ing, and Stern Hall are but a few
illustrations of these premises in op
eration.

the picturesque red tiles were combined to build Stanford Uni
versity back in 1888-91. The picture above shows the manner of
building the arches and walls of Inner Quad and sections of the
tiled roofs. This first portion of the University follows the

Richardsonian Romanesque architectural style, typified by short
