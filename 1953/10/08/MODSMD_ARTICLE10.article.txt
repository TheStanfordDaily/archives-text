"The 83rd Congress is noteworthy
for its economy-mindcdness," de
clared Charles W. Gubser, U.S.
Congressman from the 10th District,
in a speech delivered last night for
about 100 Palo Alto and Stanford
Young Republicans.
Gubser conceded that the record
of the Republican-controlled Con
gress was not, except for its econ
omy measures, particularly spectac
ular. But, he said, with a Demo
cratic budget and Democratic prob
lems to work with for the first few
months, a program of lar-reaching
change would have been foolish and
perhaps disastrous.
Commenting on the reduction
in the defense budget, the young
Congressman claimed national se
curity has not been endangered
by one iota.
"Eisenhower has revised the con
cept of the instant of danger, advo
cated by Truman, to that of the age
of peril," declared Gubser. "We
now have more combat aircraft
than Truman had contemplated, at
the sacrifice of the more unneces
sary kinds of aircraft."
Plugging the GOP's foreign pol
icy, Gubser lauded the "aggressive"
attitude of the Eisenhower adminis
tration, saying that the United
States now takes the initiative, and
acts, rather than reacts. The effects
of this policy, he stated, may be
seen in the German food riots and
the victory of Konrad Adenauer in
the recent presidential election in
Western Germany.
"Europe," he said, "is now saved
to the cause of freedom and democ
racy."
When asked by The Daily to
take a stand on the matter of uni
versity investigations and loyalty
probes, Gubser stated categori
cally, "I approve of any investi
gation which is conducted by men
who are sincere of purpose."
Gubser also defended the Repub
lican stand on the Tidelands Oil Bill
and the Veterans Aid Bill, and ad
vocated statehood for Alaska.
