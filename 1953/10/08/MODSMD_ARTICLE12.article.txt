# ASSU Excom to Study Campus Hazards; Gives Approval to Political Union Constitution
## 
### BARBARA TUERK Associate Editor, The Daily 
After hearing quotes from an
official Health Service report
that three-fourths of the deaths
at Stanford in the past years
have resulted from bodily in
juries and accidents, the Execu
tive Committee last night ap
proved a proposal for the forma
tion of a new standing committee
to study and deal with campus
hazards.
In other key action at last night's
meeting, Excom gave unanimous
approval to the constitution for the
new Stanford Political Union.
Tom Hodges, president of the Axe
Society, and Jack Valpe, chairman
of the Student-Faculty Health Com
mittee, presented a joint proposal
for the new campus hazards com
mittee, and said that members of
their committees would work on the j
new project.
They said that their action was
partially prompted by the recent

fatal traffic crash on Alpine Road.
Quoting from a report on cam
pus health in the past seven
years made by Health Service
Director Dr. George C. Houck,
llodges said that alcohol has been
a factor in one-half of the acci
dents in that time.
"However," he said, "we believe
that as a cause of accidents alcohol
is probably secondary to the fact
that there is not enough attention
paid to traffic hazards."
Hodges and liis committee plan to
work with local and state traffic of
fices, the Corporation Yard, The
Daily, and interested students to in
vestigate and eliminate unnecessary
dangers.
"We don't like the word acci
dent," he explained. "An accident
sounds like an act of God. perhaps
unavoidable. VVe believe that there
is a cause for every accident. In
the past there has been no program
to prevent these causes. That is
what we are here to do."
His committee will initiate two
specific programs to deal with the
problem:
1. A survey made with the help

of police (Â»112 possible danger spots,
to be followed by an extensive
program aimed at traffic controls
and warnings wherever such traps
exist.
2. Publicity and posters to em
phasize the dangers to each indi
vidual student from hazardous
conditions.
Excom voted down the only im
portant objection raised to the Po
litical Union's constitution. Men's
halls representative Bob Mishell
questioned the provision that recog
nized parties must include 25 per
cent of the Union's membership.
Mishell said he believed it would be
too difficult for groups to find
enough members to start a party to
represent their opinions.
Wayne Fuller, chairman of the
I nion's steering committee, ex
plained that the 25 per cent pro
vision was included because "If
you have small cliques trying to
promote a viewpoint which might
be very narrow, you don't get the
compromises upon issues that you
are forced to make within a larger
and more realistic group."
Excom also announced appoint
ments to the committee set up last
week to study clarification of the
Honor Code. Committee members
will be David Carr, Nancy Nichol
son, and Jim Mitchell from Excom;
Bill Dickenson, Men's Council; Car
ol Folsom, Womens' Council; Norm
Lenzer. F un d a m en t a I Standard
Committee; Skip Smith, Student-
Faculty Education Committee; and
Dr. George H. Knoles and Dr. Clif
ford F. Weigle from the faculty.
O I h e r appointments announced
last night included those of Paul
Bissinger and Dick Mansfield as
chairmen of the Con Home Enter
tainment Committee, and of Rose
mary Rood, Union Residence presi
dent, to the Union Board of Gover
nors.
