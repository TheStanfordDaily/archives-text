# And Now, the Test
## 
### 
Last night Excom approved the constitution
of the new Stanford Politic. 1 Union. And next
week, a year and a half after the Board of Trus
tees first voted to relax the University's tradi
tional ban against partisan politics on campus,
students will be able to meet right in the middle
of the campus— in Cubberley Hall to organize
student parties to debate political controver
sies.
Behind the long-awaited appearance of stu
dent political parties 0:1 campus lies a full year
and a half of careful thought and planning. A
Student-Faculty Political Committee, appointed
by Excom immediately after the Board's new
ruling, experimented for a full year with sev
eral methods of arousing student political in
terest before it finally recommended that a "Po
litical Union" with student parlies would give
students the best chance to talk over politics.
The phrase "Political Union" sounded just
great to all concerned. "Just like Yale's and
Oxford's"—that sounded great, too. Every
one knew how successful ihose Unions were.
But saying we wanted a "Political Union like
Yale's and Oxford s" was one thing. Adapt
ing such a-Union to Stanford's special needs
was much harder.
There were thousands of decisions to be
made. Should the new Union's programs em
phasize outside speakers? student speakers?
or the casual student who jus' dropped by the
meeting? Should parties be organized along
strict Republican-Democrat lines? What about
"independents"? ' What about splinter parties?
The constitution Excom passed last night is
long, and it seems complex. But it had to be,

because the students who drew it up were
drawing a middle course, trying to provide an
organizational framework flexible enough so
that the students themselves will be able to
make the critical choices as problems come up.
Drawing up a middle of *he road constitu
tion wasn't easy. Finding the right compro
mises took two guarters of time and effort.
But the ease with which the constitution was
passed last night proved how succcssful the
students who drew it up were in their deter
mination to find those compromises.
Now Stanford has its Political Union. But the
hardest part is still ahead—making it work.
One week from today, next Thursday night,
the Political Union will hold its first organiza
tional meeting in Cubberley. Several students
have already said that they want to help form
parties. A prominent California Democrat has
already promised to lead off the first debate
on Oct. 28 by presenting his party's point of
view on repeal of the Taft-Hartley Law.
For years we've been wanting this Political
Union, and now it's almost within our grasp.
We have a constitution that seems to have
solved the pesky organizational problems,
baby parties that we'll be able to do what we
want to with, and a challenging subject to
debate at the first meeting.
It's all there. All there, that is, except the
one essential—members. We've got the con
stitution, the parties, and the chance to debate.
When the members show up next Thursday
night, Stanford should be well ori its way to
ward a Political Union that v/ill prove that Stan
ford has abandoned its ivy tower at long last
and for once and for all.- Barbara Tuerk

When the members show up next Thursday
night, Stanford should be well ori its way to
ward a Political Union that v/ill prove that Stan
ford has abandoned its ivy tower at long last
and for once and for all.- Barbara Tuerk
Last night Excom approved the constitution
of the new Stanford Politic. 1 Union. And next
week, a year and a half after the Board of Trus
tees first voted to relax the University's tradi
tional ban against partisan politics on campus,
students will be able to meet right in the middle
of the campus— in Cubberley Hall to organize
student parties to debate political controver
sies.
Behind the long-awaited appearance of stu
dent political parties 0:1 campus lies a full year
and a half of careful thought and planning. A
Student-Faculty Political Committee, appointed
by Excom immediately after the Board's new
ruling, experimented for a full year with sev
eral methods of arousing student political in
terest before it finally recommended that a "Po
litical Union" with student parlies would give
students the best chance to talk over politics.
The phrase "Political Union" sounded just
great to all concerned. "Just like Yale's and
Oxford's"—that sounded great, too. Every
one knew how successful ihose Unions were.
But saying we wanted a "Political Union like
Yale's and Oxford s" was one thing. Adapt
ing such a-Union to Stanford's special needs
was much harder.
There were thousands of decisions to be
made. Should the new Union's programs em
phasize outside speakers? student speakers?
or the casual student who jus' dropped by the
meeting? Should parties be organized along
strict Republican-Democrat lines? What about
"independents"? ' What about splinter parties?
The constitution Excom passed last night is
long, and it seems complex. But it had to be,

because the students who drew it up were
drawing a middle course, trying to provide an
organizational framework flexible enough so
that the students themselves will be able to
make the critical choices as problems come up.
Drawing up a middle of *he road constitu
tion wasn't easy. Finding the right compro
mises took two guarters of time and effort.
But the ease with which the constitution was
passed last night proved how succcssful the
students who drew it up were in their deter
mination to find those compromises.
Now Stanford has its Political Union. But the
hardest part is still ahead—making it work.
One week from today, next Thursday night,
the Political Union will hold its first organiza
tional meeting in Cubberley. Several students
have already said that they want to help form
parties. A prominent California Democrat has
already promised to lead off the first debate
on Oct. 28 by presenting his party's point of
view on repeal of the Taft-Hartley Law.
For years we've been wanting this Political
Union, and now it's almost within our grasp.
We have a constitution that seems to have
solved the pesky organizational problems,
baby parties that we'll be able to do what we
want to with, and a challenging subject to
debate at the first meeting.
It's all there. All there, that is, except the
one essential—members. We've got the con
stitution, the parties, and the chance to debate.
