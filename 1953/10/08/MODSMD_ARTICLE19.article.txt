### DICK MANSFIELD 
There is a school in New England which prints
occasionally a riotously funny dictionary of all the
terminology currently in use amon;.' the students, in
cluding, alas, popular nickname* for most of the fac-

ulty members. Such a custom
should be instituted at Stanford,
lor surely, the lingo around here
must stump some freshmen. The
words may be familiar, but the
meanings aren't.
This year's Frosh Bible gave
you a list of terms which are
generally used. Of course, what
the editor actually did was copy
the list from last year's Frosh
Bible, which was in turn copied

from another list, with the line of direct descent lead
ing back to the original list of Stanford expressions,
which was drawn up by Leland Stanford and his
lawyer. Certain of these expressions are becoming
obsolete. Here, gathered with as little pain and care
as possible, are a few modern Stanfordisms which
ought to keep you in the Know at Engineering
Corner for maybe five minutes.
JOLLY-UP—A solemn L-atbering of freshmen and
certain sophomores whose cheeks are still rosy
enough to let them sneak in. Designed to get the
frosh in a serious mood for studies

REG DANCE — A solemn gathering of freshmen ]
and certain sophomores, held quarterly. (Exception: i
This year's! Wait till next quarter.)
QUAD —Short for quadrangle, which means a fig
ure having lour corners, which adequately describes \
the center of Stanford academic life, almost any text- j
book, and a Publication, full of pictures and other
entertaining features, which breaks your budget in
the fall and then doesn't come out until spring.
CAR — A long, sleek, bright red, souped - up,
chromed convertible.
WRECK—Anything else which passes for transpor
tation.
HOOV ElRE—Hoover Tower's raison-d'etre. Here
congregate Minds, to Ponder, and Students, to Study, !
because it is the only quiet spot on campus, though
rather exclusive.
FROST—Obviously not meant to indicate a local
weather condition. Stands for the pit where fresh- I
men hear their first words and seniors their last. In |
between, there is sinking in the spring. (One fresh- !
man reputedly asked his R.A.: "Uncle John, did !
Paul Bunyan dig Frost?")
TOE ClTY—Tijuana.
CIV—As a matter of fact, we did recruit a youth
to tell us what Civ is, but lit? got to gibbering and
we had to put him away.

rather exclusive.
FROST—Obviously not meant to indicate a local
weather condition. Stands for the pit where fresh- I
men hear their first words and seniors their last. In |
between, there is sinking in the spring. (One fresh- !
man reputedly asked his R.A.: "Uncle John, did !
Paul Bunyan dig Frost?")
TOE ClTY—Tijuana.
CIV—As a matter of fact, we did recruit a youth
to tell us what Civ is, but lit? got to gibbering and
we had to put him away.

There is a school in New England which prints
occasionally a riotously funny dictionary of all the
terminology currently in use amon;.' the students, in
cluding, alas, popular nickname* for most of the fac-

ulty members. Such a custom
should be instituted at Stanford,
lor surely, the lingo around here
must stump some freshmen. The
words may be familiar, but the
meanings aren't.
This year's Frosh Bible gave
you a list of terms which are
generally used. Of course, what
the editor actually did was copy
the list from last year's Frosh
Bible, which was in turn copied

from another list, with the line of direct descent lead
ing back to the original list of Stanford expressions,
which was drawn up by Leland Stanford and his
lawyer. Certain of these expressions are becoming
obsolete. Here, gathered with as little pain and care
as possible, are a few modern Stanfordisms which
ought to keep you in the Know at Engineering
Corner for maybe five minutes.
JOLLY-UP—A solemn L-atbering of freshmen and
certain sophomores whose cheeks are still rosy
enough to let them sneak in. Designed to get the
frosh in a serious mood for studies

REG DANCE — A solemn gathering of freshmen ]
and certain sophomores, held quarterly. (Exception: i
This year's! Wait till next quarter.)
QUAD —Short for quadrangle, which means a fig
ure having lour corners, which adequately describes \
the center of Stanford academic life, almost any text- j
book, and a Publication, full of pictures and other
entertaining features, which breaks your budget in
the fall and then doesn't come out until spring.
CAR — A long, sleek, bright red, souped - up,
chromed convertible.
WRECK—Anything else which passes for transpor
tation.
HOOV ElRE—Hoover Tower's raison-d'etre. Here
congregate Minds, to Ponder, and Students, to Study, !
because it is the only quiet spot on campus, though
rather exclusive.
