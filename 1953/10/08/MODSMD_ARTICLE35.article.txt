# Week: A History of Stanford
## IT ALL BEGAN IN 1891 'Stanford Family' Tradition Started by First Students 
### PAT KING 
Sixty-two years ago there was no Back to the Farm Week. N !
>eniors were puffing their way out to Rudy's for Olympic Dav
S T o yellowed photographs were on display in the library.
Sixty-two years ago Stanford University was first opened tc 1
00 eager students. Ahead lay all the heartaches of near financia !

uin in the panic of '9'i and near
'hysical destruction in the 190t! fire
nd earthquake. Ahead lay all the
idvances in science and the tem
porary sidetracking of human rela
.ion . Ahead lay the establishing of
patterns of thought and action
/vhich have since* become traditions.
The first Stanford tn.dilion en
i t d witli that fie hmun class in
fit l fall of lN9i. The tradition ol the
'Stanford Family."
Senator and Mrs. Stanford,
heart broken over the loss of their
only child, Leland Jr., adopted
t1?0.,e first 500 students as their
own. They spent hours visiting
with student*- on (}uad, and their
home, now the site of the Con
valescent Home, was the scene of
many open house;.
As years pa sed and the student
body grew in : ize, it was no longer
possible foi' Mr . Stanford to know
everyone l y name. But the tra*. i
tion ol friendship has remained.
In his weleopiing note to the
members of this year's freshman
ela'-s, Dr. J. E. Wallace Sterling,
speaking for him.'elf and Mr . Ster
ling, emphasized this with the hope
that students "will take full advan
tage ol the hospitality we can ex
tend at our home, and please re
member that when 1 am in my of
fice, the door will always be open
to you."
Mutual respect, loyalty, and
friendship—a tradition as old as
Stanford itself.
Growing from this attitude came
one of Stanford's most cherished
traditions, the Honor Code. Al
though not established until 11)23,
the idea behind the Honor Code was
i/i Stanford's mind when lie wrote:
"And the purposes (of the Uni
versity), to promote the public wel
fare by exercising an influence in
behalf of humanity and civilization,
teaching the blessings of liberty
regulated by law. . . ."
' The blessings of liberty regulated
by law—that phrase describes the
principle behind the Honor Code of
today, behind the wide freedom and
accompanying responsibility which
is a part of Stanford life. And each
year a new group of student leaders
sees that the spirit of the Honor
Code is upheld so that the open
classroom door will never be locked.
Still another tradition was ini

tiated that f.'r t year, one which
relied, the mature and intelligent
altitude ol Stanford students. I
There i-, no hazing of freshmen.
Not long alter the University wa !
lounded, tradition found anothei
bL'-'innni", i;i the rivalry between ,
the University of California and the i
Farm in Halo Alto. The lirst Bit- j
(lame, which w.is bin oniy in name i
took place March 19, 1b92, at the i
llaight Street Baseball Grounds in
j San Francisco.
Although the contest got off to a |
! poor .start when il was discovered
that nobody had thou 1 lit to provide
I a football, the day was a happy one
for the Cardinal rooters. Stanford
dumped the mighty Golden Bear
14 to 12.
Seven years later, iu 1899, the
Stanford Axe became another
tradition as the Big Game tro
phy. Il was introduced by yell
leader Bill Erb to boost spirit, and
was immediately stolen by Cal
students.
The battle for possession raged on
! for several years, with the mo t
j daring raid engineered by the "Im
mortal 21" of Stanford in 1932. Af
ter that, a han-ls-off policy was es
tablished between the schools, and
it was agreed that the Axe would
go to the winner of the annual Big
Game.
The latest disappearing act took
place last spring, when the trophy ,
| wai again stolen from Cal. So once
again Cal students are peeking be
neath the Stanford tepee in hopes !
j of uncovering the prize.
Some traditions have failed to
j withstand the test of time and are
I gradually disappearing from the
j scene. Mrs. Stanford requested i
through Dr. Jordan, the Univer- !
sity's first president, that there be j
no smoking on Quad.
Her Request was respected
through the days of the corn-cob '
pipe and the brown roll-your
owii cigarette, but today nicotine
! addicts no longer refrain from en
joying a lew pulls on tjuad be
tween classes.
Traditions. Just another word for j
that which has become a habit, a |
| way of life. And at Stanford it j
means, above all, freedom anil re- !
sponsibility.

i t d witli that fie hmun class in

'Stanford Family."
Senator and Mrs. Stanford,
heart broken over the loss of their
only child, Leland Jr., adopted
t1?0.,e first 500 students as their
own. They spent hours visiting
with student*- on (}uad, and their
home, now the site of the Con
valescent Home, was the scene of
many open house;.
As years pa sed and the student
body grew in : ize, it was no longer
possible foi' Mr . Stanford to know
everyone l y name. But the tra*. i
tion ol friendship has remained.
In his weleopiing note to the
members of this year's freshman
ela'-s, Dr. J. E. Wallace Sterling,
speaking for him.'elf and Mr . Ster
ling, emphasized this with the hope
that students "will take full advan
tage ol the hospitality we can ex
tend at our home, and please re
member that when 1 am in my of
fice, the door will always be open
to you."
Mutual respect, loyalty, and
friendship—a tradition as old as
Stanford itself.
Growing from this attitude came
one of Stanford's most cherished
traditions, the Honor Code. Al
though not established until 11)23,
the idea behind the Honor Code was
i/i Stanford's mind when lie wrote:
"And the purposes (of the Uni
versity), to promote the public wel
fare by exercising an influence in
behalf of humanity and civilization,
teaching the blessings of liberty
regulated by law. . . ."
' The blessings of liberty regulated
by law—that phrase describes the
principle behind the Honor Code of
today, behind the wide freedom and
accompanying responsibility which
is a part of Stanford life. And each
year a new group of student leaders
sees that the spirit of the Honor
Code is upheld so that the open
classroom door will never be locked.
Still another tradition was ini

tiated that f.'r t year, one which
relied, the mature and intelligent
altitude ol Stanford students. I
There i-, no hazing of freshmen.

that nobody had thou 1 lit to provide
I a football, the day was a happy one
for the Cardinal rooters. Stanford
dumped the mighty Golden Bear
14 to 12.
Seven years later, iu 1899, the
Stanford Axe became another
tradition as the Big Game tro
phy. Il was introduced by yell
leader Bill Erb to boost spirit, and
was immediately stolen by Cal
students.
The battle for possession raged on
! for several years, with the mo t
j daring raid engineered by the "Im

ter that, a han-ls-off policy was es
tablished between the schools, and
it was agreed that the Axe would
go to the winner of the annual Big
Game.
The latest disappearing act took
place last spring, when the trophy ,

Some traditions have failed to
j withstand the test of time and are
I gradually disappearing from the

through Dr. Jordan, the Univer- !

no smoking on Quad.
Her Request was respected

As years pa sed and the student
body grew in : ize, it was no longer
possible foi' Mr . Stanford to know
everyone l y name. But the tra*. i
tion ol friendship has remained.
In his weleopiing note to the
members of this year's freshman
ela'-s, Dr. J. E. Wallace Sterling,
speaking for him.'elf and Mr . Ster
ling, emphasized this with the hope
that students "will take full advan
tage ol the hospitality we can ex
tend at our home, and please re
member that when 1 am in my of
fice, the door will always be open
to you."
Mutual respect, loyalty, and
friendship—a tradition as old as
Stanford itself.
Growing from this attitude came
one of Stanford's most cherished
traditions, the Honor Code. Al
though not established until 11)23,
the idea behind the Honor Code was
i/i Stanford's mind when lie wrote:
"And the purposes (of the Uni
versity), to promote the public wel
fare by exercising an influence in
behalf of humanity and civilization,
teaching the blessings of liberty
regulated by law. . . ."
' The blessings of liberty regulated
by law—that phrase describes the
principle behind the Honor Code of
today, behind the wide freedom and
accompanying responsibility which
is a part of Stanford life. And each
year a new group of student leaders
sees that the spirit of the Honor
Code is upheld so that the open
classroom door will never be locked.
Still another tradition was ini

tiated that f.'r t year, one which
relied, the mature and intelligent
altitude ol Stanford students. I

Seven years later, iu 1899, the
Stanford Axe became another
tradition as the Big Game tro
phy. Il was introduced by yell
leader Bill Erb to boost spirit, and
was immediately stolen by Cal
students.
The battle for possession raged on

j daring raid engineered by the "Im
mortal 21" of Stanford in 1932. Af
ter that, a han-ls-off policy was es
tablished between the schools, and
it was agreed that the Axe would
go to the winner of the annual Big
Game.
The latest disappearing act took

Some traditions have failed to
j withstand the test of time and are
