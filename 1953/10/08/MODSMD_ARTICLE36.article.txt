## 
### 
II you had been a student at Stan
ford in 1897 the newspaper you
! scanned over your morning's coffee !
| would have been a far cry from to- ;
day's Stanford Daily.
; Tabloid size, the Daily Palo Alto,
I as it was called then, featured four
| wide columns to a page, no pictures,
| and an over-all appearance com
parable to that of the London Times.
Lead story for the issue of Sept. 3,
i 1897, was a fascinating 900-word ac
j count of President Jordan's trip to
Alaska to "see what could be done
to prevent the extermination of the
j fur seal herds."
In the same issue it was adver
| ti;;ed that copies of Quad were still
selling foi $1.50. Other items: a
I shave 15 cents; a haircut 25 cents.
