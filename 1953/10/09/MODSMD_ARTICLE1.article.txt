						Word to the Wise

A word to the wise should bo sufficient and this word is
official.
State law enforcement agencies the Board of Equalization
and the Highway Patrol, acting chiefly at the request of student
leaders are planning a crackdown, one that is hard and relent
less, designed to eliminate speeding along Alpine Road, which
has become the scene of a number of tragic auto crashes.
Tomorrow at least 1,000 Stanford students, maybe more, plan
to attend the Olympic Day festivities at Hudy's Alpine Inn, which
is located on Alpine Road. And tomorrow the eyes of the law are
going to be extra sharp.
The officers apparently are not fooling when they say "crack
down." . \
They mean citations and possibly sterner action.
The Daily, the administration, and leaders of the student body
do not want o see fellow Stanfordites in the grips of the law.
Nor do they want to see another grim sight like that enacted
on Alpine Road more than a week ago when sophomore Alec
Gerbode was killed in a head-on collision.
We think the highway patrolmen should take swift action, if
necessary.
But we hope and this sincerely —that students, acting intel
ligently and considerately, will make such action unnecessary
by policing themselves.
We hope that they will remain within the bounds of temperate
conduct, that they will drive with proper caution.
As we said, a word to the wise should be sufficient.
