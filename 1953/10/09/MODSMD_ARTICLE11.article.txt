# UC Axe Committee Reports Plans for Recovering Blade
## 
### BOH REZAK Associate Editor, The Daily 
The University of California's |
special Axe-finding committee has j
reportedly devised a plan to recover i
the stolen Stanford Axe but is keep
ing necessarily mum on specific dei
tails of the plan, The Daily learned
last night.
Nancy Martin, UC senior class
vice-president, described the plans
as "secretive" and declined further
comment.
At the same time, Ralph Vet
tcrlcin. president of the Associ
ated Students of .the University
of California, confided that he and
members of his fraternity. Alpha
Kappa Lambda, had visited Stan
ford recently in hopes of uncover
ing clues that would indicate the
possibility that the Axe is being
hidden on the Farm.
The committee, appointed Wed
nesday, is composed of the senior
class executive council anefcthe Sen
ior Peace Council, a student group
entrusted with upholding Cal tra
ditions and guarding the big "C.
The committee has been given
until Big Game time to recover the

old blade, which was stolen from j
the Berkeley campus last June.
In trying to determine whether
or not the Axe is now on the
Stanford campus, Vetterlein said
he was working in conjunction
with former Cal students now en
rolled at Stanford.
There is a '"ten to one chance"
the Axe is at Stanford, Vetterlein
said.
He said that the Cal students now
at Stanford were only "questioned"
about the Axe's disappearance and
that no investigation of the Stanford
campus was made.
The ASUC president also pooh- j
poohed the rumor that the Stanford
baseball team had stolen the Axe
to take to the Nationals in Omaha
last June.
"That was just a gag on our
part," lie revealed. "Our basket
ball coach. Nibs Price, was in
Omaha at the same time and we
sent him a gag telegram telling
him that 'Stanford's got the Axe!
Find it!' "
Vetterlein, who will visit Stan
ford within the next two weeks to
sign a Big Game non-aggression
pact between the two schools, said
that UC campus police and Berke
ley police would not make an in
vestigation of the theft unless
charges were filed against possible
suspects police might be able to un
cover.
He said that he had no intention
of filing any such charges.
The newly appointed Axe-find
ing committee, meanwhile, "has
accepted the job," Vetterlein said.
He declared that as of yesterday
the committee was *"150 strong"
and had "spirit" and determina
tion.
So far the only clue in the theft
has been a $5 bill found near the
showcase in which the Axe is dis
played at Cal.
A UC student spokesman, speak
ing unofficially, told The Daily last
night he thought the Axe might
have been stolen by Cal students
in a move to direct suspicion on
Stanford.
He thought it was possible the
Axe might turn up on the Stanford
campus prior to the Bin Game, but
lie emphasized that this wa.s purely
conjecture on his part.
