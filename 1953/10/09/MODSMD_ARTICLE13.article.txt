Up in the Oregon land,
it's always green because it nl

are scheduled to beat Oregon
State in Portland's Multnomah
Stadium tomorrow. The gamo
will be broadcast.
Insiders are saying that Oregon
State (1) has no offense; (2) has mi

95 points in three games; (2) Ore-

(3) made one (1) yard rushing
against Washington last week.

America.
are making hoy coach Chuck Tay
lor lose sleep. He's afraid that his
underlings are looking past this
game to UCLA, and reports from
the Northland indicate that Ore
gon State has been a new team in
practice this week. The Beavers
are frenzied.
The Beavers, who employ the "T,"
the Michigan spinner attack, and
two other formations, Yiave regained
the services of four formerly injured
players, among tehm hard-driving
halfback Jack Pinion. This should
help them considerably.
Their top threats are half Ralph
Carr and sharp-passing signal-call
er Jim Withrow. However, Withrow
loses his head when he is rushed,
and it's a certain thing that Manoo
gian, Wilson, Armitage, and com
pany are going to be rushing the
feet of! Withrow.
Although the defense, particu
larly tackling, left something to
he desired in the Illinois game,
the offense was at its shattering
best. Blond Bohhy Garrett, who
had neglected in the first two
games the instrument that won
him league honors last year, the
forward pass, unloosened his arm
against the Illini. The result was
12 completions in 2.'1 attempts for
17K yards. He not only threw to
ends John Steinberg and piano
playing Sam Morley, two of the
best receivers in the country, but
also picked out halfs Hon Cook
and Ernie Dorn as targets.
Cook, who has been a starter for
three years, had one of his best of
fensive days against the Illini, and
Dorn, the squat Minneapolis soph
with the piston legs, definitely
grabbed the first-string right half
spot.
The coaches have also been sing
ing the praises of Phil Wilson, the
wrestler turned guard. Wilson, who
packs 200 well-muscled pounds on
a five - foot eight - inch frame, has
been positively ferocious this sea
son. He and All-American candi
date Norm Manoogian make a for
midable guard duo.
Thirty-three players will make
the trip, all of whom should see ac
tion. The travel squad consists of:
Ends: John Steinberg, Sam Mor-

halfback Jack Pinion. This should
help them considerably.
Their top threats are half Ralph
Carr and sharp-passing signal-call
er Jim Withrow. However, Withrow
loses his head when he is rushed,
and it's a certain thing that Manoo
gian, Wilson, Armitage, and com
pany are going to be rushing the
feet of! Withrow.
Although the defense, particu
larly tackling, left something to
he desired in the Illinois game,
the offense was at its shattering
best. Blond Bohhy Garrett, who
had neglected in the first two
games the instrument that won
him league honors last year, the
forward pass, unloosened his arm
against the Illini. The result was
12 completions in 2.'1 attempts for
17K yards. He not only threw to
ends John Steinberg and piano
playing Sam Morley, two of the
best receivers in the country, but
also picked out halfs Hon Cook
and Ernie Dorn as targets.
Cook, who has been a starter for
three years, had one of his best of
fensive days against the Illini, and
Dorn, the squat Minneapolis soph
with the piston legs, definitely
grabbed the first-string right half
spot.
The coaches have also been sing
ing the praises of Phil Wilson, the
wrestler turned guard. Wilson, who
packs 200 well-muscled pounds on
a five - foot eight - inch frame, has
been positively ferocious this sea
son. He and All-American candi
date Norm Manoogian make a for
midable guard duo.

tion. The travel squad consists of:
