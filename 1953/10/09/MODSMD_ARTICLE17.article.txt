That some students have organized to study
the causes of campus accidents is, we think,
a fine project—one, perhaps, that is long over
due.
For, we feel, that any effort to eliminate the
number of hazards must come initially from the
.students, being—as they are—the prime vic
tims of the many roadway and other accidents
that occur on or near campus.
They, by sheer number alone, comp more
frequently into contact with the sources of acci
dents that often maim and sometimes kill.
And. perhaps, of all groups, they are the
ones that need most to be impressed with
the need for careful conduct, not only on the
highways but also in the laboratory and the
dormitoiy.

It would seem that the project undertaken by
the Axe Society, with the sanction of the Execu
tive Committee, will not only perform the much
needed function of locating and identifying
definite danger points but also will help ac
quaint students with what common sense
should have taught them —the need for caution
and care.
It is hoped that the group founded by Tom
Hodges, president of the Axe Society, and Jack
Valpe of the Student Faculty Health Committee,
will continue their work with the same fervor
and determination with which they undertook
it.
For the possible benefit to the campus to
each student —is immense.
