# A 						Chance to Learn

Stanford is lucky.
In a world where most communities are iso
lated by political, geographic, or social bound
aries or limitations; the students of Stanford
have the peculiar advantage of being able to
acquire some understanding of the "outside"
world merely by looking around them.
These are the parts of that advantage:
The students who have come to Stanford
from foreign countries, students who are an
xious to develop not only their technical skills
in the classroom but their understanding of the
American society and its people.
The Institute of International Relations (11R),
the Stanford organization which is most re
sponsible for channeling the efforts of those
foreign students to communicate with their
fellow students at Stanford.
The ASSU Foreign Scholarship Committee,
an enthusiastic, imaginative group which ar
ranges for scholarships for eight foreign stu
dents each year and effects a program by which
those eight students meet as many members
of the Stanford community as possible.
Through the determination of Stanford's for
eign students to know and understand the peo

pie of their host country and through the ef
forts of the ASSU and the lIR, Stanford has
acquired a reputation of being one of the most
internationally conscious universities in the
country. Dr. Milton Eisenhower, recent chair
man of the U.S. National Commission for
UNESCO and President of the University of
Pennsylvania, has this to say of Stanford:
"I know of no student body which is doing
more to educate itself for world citizenship
than the student body of Stanford Univer
sity. . . . Stanford students are doing a job
which might well be imitated by other
schools throughout the land."
The reputation is set. The opportunities are
there. But learning is constant and continuous,
and the students of Stanford must take their
share of the responsibility in a successful pro
gram of international understanding. They
must realize that there is a world which lies
beyond the ski slopes of the Sierras and the
beaches of the California coast, and that a part
of that world, the foreign student, has become
a part of the Stanford community.
