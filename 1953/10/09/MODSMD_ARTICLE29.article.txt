# Stanford Water Polo Team Will Meet Cal in Berkeley
## 
### DON STEPHENS 
y/hen the local water polo team tangles with their counterparts
lrom Cal at Berkeley tomorrow morning, it may be for the Pacific
Coast title.
The experts predict that the two squads will sweep conference
and independent competition, and that one will have to whip the

other twice to notch the crown.
It will be a tough battle, with
both rosters boasting All-Confer
ence returnees. Stanford's Jim
Gaughran, who scored five goals
in the 11-7 defeat of San Jose
State last Wednesday, led the
conference scoring parade, while
( id's Boh Kahl was All-Confer
ence goalie. So fai this year Kahl
has limited opponents to goals
in two matches.
The San Jose victory proved that
Stanford has a good offense and a
weak defense. Against the zone de
fense employed effectively by "the
Spartans, the Cards scored 11 goals
a high number against such a de
fense. But the mediocre San Jose
aps retaliated with seven scores.
And. after comparing Cal's de
fensive positions, the guards, it
seems the Indians will have a
tough time scoring in double
numbers; however, considering" the
offensive-forward spots, the locals
have the edge because of speed
sters like Gaughraip, Jim Lee,
and levin Johnson. Cal's Kahl
rates the edge in the goal position
over Stanford's Dave Murton.
Last year Stanford was rated a
favorite to win the crown, but two
California upsets led to a conference
crown for the Bears—their second
vorisecutive.
Cal's coach, George Schroth,
announced the following lineup:
Forwards: Becker, Gordon Gill,
Bill Armstrong; guards: Don
Kamler, Don Smalian, Jim Ross;
golie: Kahl.
Stanford's starting lineup: For
wards: Irvin Johnson, Jim Lee,
Gaughran; guards: John Schmidt,
Fritz Kunsel, Wally Parks; goalie:
Dave Murton.
Tom Haynie announced the ineli
nii-blity of Dan Osborne, because of
scholastic difficulties.
The Bear frosh will meet the Stan
ford yearlings immediately follow
ing the varsity encounter.
