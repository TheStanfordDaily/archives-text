# Manoukian May Fill Norm's Place
## 
### 
Another Norm Mnnoogian? That
is the question Stanford football
coaches have been asking them
selves as they watch freshman Don
Manoukian rip the opposing line in
scrimmage.
Manoukian, a burly 202-lb., 5-ft.
8-in. lineman, is rated as one of
the top frosh prospects to reach the
"Farm" in recent years. Coinciden
tally, his favorite position is guard,
the same position at which captain
Norm Manoogian "gained his fame.
Don is a native Californian, but
played his last two years of high
school ball at Reno, Nevada, where
he was twice named All - State
guard. In his senior year at Reno,
he was voted captain of the All-
State team, and was awarded a first
string berth on the high school "All-
American" team.
In addition to his football ability,
Manoukian is a track man of con
siderable stature. For two years
running, he was Nevada's top man
in the shot put. Last year he set a
new Nevada record for the shot In
the high school class, and also broke
the shot record in a meet comprised
of the best high school track men
from five states. In addition to this
he received considerable local ac
claim for his wrestling prowess.
A quiet, likeable fellow, Don was
very active in student affairs, and
served as president of his high
school class.
Manoukian received offers of ath
letic scholarships from several West
Coast colleges, including Oregon,
but elected to attend Stanford.
