## Soccer Team Plays CCSF 
### 
City College of San Francisco,
their heads swollen by a 1-1 tie with
the perenially powerful USF, come
bursting in here tomorrow morning
to give Coach Leo Weinstein's soc
cer varsity its baptism of fire at 10
a.m. on the Stanford soccer field.
Perhaps old USF isn't quite what
it used to be, but Weinstein seems
to think so, and consequently the
CCSF will provide the red and
! white hooters with an extremely
rugged opening test. They have a
center-forward by the name of
Martinez, one of the highest scor
ers in an extremely fast San Fran
cisco city league.
Soccer is an extremely fast game
played on a field a little larger than
a football field, the main idea being,
as in hockey and water polo, to put
the spherical through a large wood
en frame defended by a goalie.
One hitchâ€”the 11 players per
team, with the exception of the
goalie, cannot use their hands,
only their feet and heads.
Here is the lineup Coach Leo
Weinstein has tentatively selected to
oppose Martinez & Co.:
Goalie Ken Woods
Left fullback lolm Sentous
Right fullback John Hanna
Left halfback Sam Register
Center halfback Derek Liecty
Right halfback Pete Mack
Right king Boh Couture
Right inside Chuck Andrews
Center forward Tom Hansen
Right inside Sam Suarez
Left wing Neils Vinding
