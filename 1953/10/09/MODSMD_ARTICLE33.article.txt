# Lunny Faces Rebuild Job
## 
### 
Boxing Coach Ray Lunny is faced
with the problem of building Stan
ford's boxing team for the ap
proaching ,'53-'54 .season. The ma
terial is available for a fine late
season showing at least. A hard
core of returning fighters, a few
other less experienced but poten
tially good, and the largest turnout
of men in the novice class in thÂ»
past four years are the foundation
of this season's riny team.
i The hard core will consist of Gary
Viievert at 132 pounds, Fred Diltmer
at 139, Jack Owens at 147, Eric
Hansen at 15(5, and Dick Kylberg
at IGS.
Lunny stated that welterweight
Owens should be a considerably im
proved fighter this season. Another
middleweight to battle with Kyl
berg for the number one spot will j
be Tony Wynn. He will return after
an absence of two years.
Others who are expected to lend
their weight to the team are Phil
Kimbell at 147 and Don Tognazzini

at 156. Both are to be classified as
those "with the potential." From
the football team will come light
heavyweight Len Doster and heavy
weight Bob Birkie. Birkie weighs
220 and, again according to Coach
Lunny, has the makings of a very
fine fighter.
At present the schedule of team
matches is in the process of being
arranged and the only matches that
aren't in the tentative stage are a
Jan. 13-Feb. 17 exchange with tne
Berkeley Bears. The first meeting
will be held at Berkeley.
Assisting Lunny with the teach- i
ing duties will be last season's PCC '
light - heavy champion, Bob Bal-i
docchi.
