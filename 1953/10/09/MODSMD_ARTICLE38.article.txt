# It took a lot of engineering to make a better "grasshopper"

Engineers at Western Eledtric's SI. Paul
Shops are well pleased with their new-style
"grasshopper" fuse—a small fuse used in
Bell telephone central office equipment.
The former model —in production for
years—had been gradually refined 'til it
seemed almost beyond further improve
ment. It was simple, inexpensive, efficient,
came off the line fast. But...
It's an old Western Electric engineering
custom to keep trying to make Bell tele
phone equipment still better, at still lower
cost. The "grasshopper" was studied by
a young engineer out of the University of
Minnesota, Class of '40. who joined the
Company in 1946. His studies indicated
the most effective way to improve effi
ciency and cut costs further was to change
the design.
Pursuing this lead the engineer and his
group saw their opportunity to make an
important contribution. They investiga
ted the latest tooling techniques, new
metals, finishing materials and methods,
all of which are constantly under study
by engineers at Western Electric plants. A
simplified design, which permitted the use
of the most modern tooling methods, re
sulted in a better fuse at lower cost that
is saving thousands of dollars a year for
Bell telephone companies.
There's an endless stream of such challeng
ing assignments at Western Electric.
Engineers of varied skills — mechanical,
electrical, civil, chemical, metallurgical
find real satisfaction in working togot heron
the important job of providing equipment
for the best telephone service on earth.
