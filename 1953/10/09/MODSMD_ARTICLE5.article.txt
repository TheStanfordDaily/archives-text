# Rescheduled Chimes Peaceful Study Times
## 
### 
After two years of "letters to j
the editor," student complaints,
and general griping, students will
now get the peace for studying 1
which they have been requesting. I
Hoover Tower carillon is on a |
new schedule.
The new policy is that the ca
rillon will be played for one-half
hour after church lets out. No
chimes will be played at 1 p.m.
The Rev. R. M. Minto. chaplain
of the University, was contacted
by A 1 Ivey, board member of Pub- j
lie Relations Committee. Minto in
turn notified Oscar Burdick of
Cal, who plays the carillon, of j
the request for a change.
Now no chimes at one. Result:
peaceful study time.
