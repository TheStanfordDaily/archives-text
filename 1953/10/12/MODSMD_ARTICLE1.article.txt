# Seven Fraternities Climax Initiations
## Pledges Now Full Members 
### JOCK McGREGOR 
Suddenly the word "pledge"
rang out.
"Pledge, paint that fence . . .
stand at attention . . . recite a
}>oem . . . take a swat . .
These were familiar orders that
echoed throughout seven campus
fraternity houses last week as they
completed initiation rites.
Many of the 22 fraternities active
on campus are scheduled to initiate
their new members toward the mid
dle of the quarter, with about three
or four holding off until the end of
the quarter.
Activities of the seven houses
which held initiation programs con
sisted of pledges doing constructive
work on fraternity houses in the
day, with the darkened hours re
served for stunts, contests, and gen
eral "merry-making."
Following a practice in recent
years, several houses patterned
their initiation programs along the
lines of a "help week" in which
pledges perform services for the
campus.
Alpha Kappa Lambda pledges, for
example, gathered together some
spray equipment, paint, and linseed
oil, and took a • stroll over to the
boathouse at Lake Lagunita.
Result: Stanford bathers will now
lind freshly oiled docks and pilings,
and brightly colored railings, thanks
to the AKL pledges.
Gene Dills, president of Inter
fraternity Council, said he be
lieved the true purpose of pre-in
itiation activities was to obtain
class unity within a fraternity
house and to develop an active
class interest in the fraternity.
Dills said he thought the initia
tions so far have been characterized
by good organization and planning
with the average class consisting of
between 15 and 20 members.
The initiation, which usually
lasts from three to five days, is
the time when pledges go through
their last, especially hectic days
as pledges, and then arc officially
admitted the fraternity as active
members.
As initiation rites drew to a close
last. weekend, one veteran pledge
was heard offering this advice to a
pledge who still anticipates going
through the rigors of initiation
week: "Get plenty of sleep before
hand."
