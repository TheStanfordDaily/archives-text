# Indians Shut Out Weak OSC, 21-0
## 
### PETE GROTHE Sports Editor, The Daily 
PORTLAND, Oct. 10 As one player enthused in the noisy,
steaming dressing room alter today's 21 to 0 squelching of Oregon
State, "Just think, we're unbeaten and unscored on in conference
play." .
The scoreboard said 21 to 0. But it just as easily could have

been 42 to 0. One touchdown wa
called back (a 24 yard aerial from
quarterback Bob Garrett to end Sam
Morley), and the first team played
less than half of the game.
The tiff neatly set the stage for
this week's UCLA titanic. The Brw •
ins and the Indians are now tied for
the PCC lead with two wins and no
losses, and UCLA, like Stanford,
hasn't allowed conference opposition
to score.
For the fourth game in a row, no
first stringers were injured. Second
string tackle John Stanton suffered
a muscle pull in his shoulder, and
the extent of the injury won't' be
known until Dr. Fritz Roth examine
the shoulder today.
It was obvious in the first quar
ter that OSC's unblemished record
of unsuccess would remain intact
The game was not five minutes old
when clean-limbed half Ron Cook
took a hand-off from Garrett on
the Stanford 24 and shot the en
tire distance to paydirt.
Shortly before the end of the
quarter the Indians rambled 54 yard,,
in seven plays. The biggest chunk .
were a 10 yarder from Garrett to In ..
high school teammate Morley and a
15 yard Cook scamper, aided by a
crunching Ernie Dorn block.
The drive seemed to falter on
the Beaver 20. With fourth and six,
Garrett, a very good passer indeed
today, wheeled back and fired a
bullet pass to John (Mantis) Stein -
berg.
The play was called by Chuck
Taylor (via tackle Win Wedge) from
the bench. Steinberg had been gone
out and cutting right all day. Thi .
time he went out, cut right, and thru
darted back to the left. Garrett con
verted from Cook's hold.
Early in the third quarter, the In
dians put together their most work
manlike drive of the game, a 75-
yard, nine-play effort. With full
back Bill Wentworth and Dorn
carrying the load, the Cards drove to
the five. There Dorn scooted right
past right guard, met quarterback
Ron Siegrist on the one, and spun
off him into the end zone. Scon .
21 to 0 after Garrett's conversion
A lot of players distinguished
themselves today. Garrett, coin
plcting eight of 11 passes for 101
yards (three others should have
been caught) inspired Beavei
Coach Kip Taylor to say, "Garrett
is a much better passer than eithei
Cal's Paul Larson or UCLA's Paul
Cameron. lie is a more natural
thrower."
Cook had his best day of the yeat,
and regulars Manoogian, Smith,

gon State's Ralph Carr on the OSC 13 yard line during secoruJ
quarter in game at Portland. Number 47 is Peter Scott, OSC
left half. —NEA Wirephoto
Steinberg, and Morley looked very
sharp. Linebacker Ted Tanner was
a demon on defense and also inter
cepted a pass. Parenthetically, the
Indians caught as many OSC passes
as OSC did—two.
Several reserves were also im
pressive. Jim Truher showed why
the coaches hold so much hope for
him as he was strong on defense and
made two 10 yard bursts up the cen
ter from his left half post. Center
Tom McKenna also looked good, as

clid guards Joel Sappenfield and Joe
Long, end Marv Tennefoss, fullback
Jarvis Watson, and tackle Chris
Marshall.
Bring on the Bruins!

the PCC lead with two wins and no
losses, and UCLA, like Stanford,
hasn't allowed conference opposition
to score.
For the fourth game in a row, no
first stringers were injured. Second
string tackle John Stanton suffered
a muscle pull in his shoulder, and
the extent of the injury won't' be
known until Dr. Fritz Roth examine
the shoulder today.
It was obvious in the first quar
ter that OSC's unblemished record
of unsuccess would remain intact
The game was not five minutes old
when clean-limbed half Ron Cook
took a hand-off from Garrett on
the Stanford 24 and shot the en
tire distance to paydirt.
Shortly before the end of the
quarter the Indians rambled 54 yard,,
in seven plays. The biggest chunk .
were a 10 yarder from Garrett to In ..
high school teammate Morley and a
15 yard Cook scamper, aided by a
crunching Ernie Dorn block.
The drive seemed to falter on
the Beaver 20. With fourth and six,
Garrett, a very good passer indeed
today, wheeled back and fired a
bullet pass to John (Mantis) Stein -
berg.
The play was called by Chuck
Taylor (via tackle Win Wedge) from
the bench. Steinberg had been gone
out and cutting right all day. Thi .
time he went out, cut right, and thru
darted back to the left. Garrett con
verted from Cook's hold.
Early in the third quarter, the In
dians put together their most work
manlike drive of the game, a 75-
yard, nine-play effort. With full
back Bill Wentworth and Dorn
carrying the load, the Cards drove to
the five. There Dorn scooted right
past right guard, met quarterback
Ron Siegrist on the one, and spun
off him into the end zone. Scon .
21 to 0 after Garrett's conversion
A lot of players distinguished
themselves today. Garrett, coin
plcting eight of 11 passes for 101
yards (three others should have
been caught) inspired Beavei
Coach Kip Taylor to say, "Garrett
is a much better passer than eithei
Cal's Paul Larson or UCLA's Paul
Cameron. lie is a more natural
thrower."

Steinberg, and Morley looked very
sharp. Linebacker Ted Tanner was
a demon on defense and also inter
cepted a pass. Parenthetically, the
Indians caught as many OSC passes
as OSC did—two.
Several reserves were also im
pressive. Jim Truher showed why
the coaches hold so much hope for
him as he was strong on defense and
made two 10 yard bursts up the cen
ter from his left half post. Center
Tom McKenna also looked good, as

PORTLAND, Oct. 10 As one player enthused in the noisy,

quarter the Indians rambled 54 yard,,
in seven plays. The biggest chunk .
were a 10 yarder from Garrett to In ..
high school teammate Morley and a
15 yard Cook scamper, aided by a
crunching Ernie Dorn block.
The drive seemed to falter on
the Beaver 20. With fourth and six,
Garrett, a very good passer indeed
today, wheeled back and fired a
bullet pass to John (Mantis) Stein -
berg.
The play was called by Chuck
Taylor (via tackle Win Wedge) from
the bench. Steinberg had been gone
out and cutting right all day. Thi .
time he went out, cut right, and thru
darted back to the left. Garrett con
verted from Cook's hold.
Early in the third quarter, the In
dians put together their most work
manlike drive of the game, a 75-
yard, nine-play effort. With full
back Bill Wentworth and Dorn
carrying the load, the Cards drove to
the five. There Dorn scooted right
past right guard, met quarterback
Ron Siegrist on the one, and spun
off him into the end zone. Scon .
21 to 0 after Garrett's conversion
A lot of players distinguished
themselves today. Garrett, coin
plcting eight of 11 passes for 101
yards (three others should have
been caught) inspired Beavei
Coach Kip Taylor to say, "Garrett
is a much better passer than eithei
Cal's Paul Larson or UCLA's Paul
Cameron. lie is a more natural
thrower."

Steinberg, and Morley looked very
sharp. Linebacker Ted Tanner was
a demon on defense and also inter
cepted a pass. Parenthetically, the
Indians caught as many OSC passes
as OSC did—two.
Several reserves were also im
pressive. Jim Truher showed why
the coaches hold so much hope for
him as he was strong on defense and
made two 10 yard bursts up the cen
ter from his left half post. Center
Tom McKenna also looked good, as

clid guards Joel Sappenfield and Joe

PORTLAND, Oct. 10 As one player enthused in the noisy,
steaming dressing room alter today's 21 to 0 squelching of Oregon
State, "Just think, we're unbeaten and unscored on in conference
play." .
The scoreboard said 21 to 0. But it just as easily could have

been 42 to 0. One touchdown wa
called back (a 24 yard aerial from
quarterback Bob Garrett to end Sam
Morley), and the first team played
less than half of the game.
The tiff neatly set the stage for
this week's UCLA titanic. The Brw •
ins and the Indians are now tied for
the PCC lead with two wins and no
losses, and UCLA, like Stanford,
hasn't allowed conference opposition
to score.
For the fourth game in a row, no
first stringers were injured. Second
string tackle John Stanton suffered
a muscle pull in his shoulder, and
the extent of the injury won't' be
known until Dr. Fritz Roth examine
the shoulder today.
It was obvious in the first quar
ter that OSC's unblemished record
of unsuccess would remain intact
The game was not five minutes old
when clean-limbed half Ron Cook
took a hand-off from Garrett on
the Stanford 24 and shot the en
tire distance to paydirt.
