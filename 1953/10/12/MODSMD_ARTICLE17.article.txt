WATERTOWN, N.Y.. Oct. 11 (UP)
—Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles said today this country will
never bow to a "small minority" who
believe that "uniformity of thought"
and expression should be imposed to
meet the Communist threat.
He also declared that freedom and
religious faith are greater weapons
than the atomic bomb in the cold
war. He pledged that the administra
tion never will turn this nation into
a "material fortress" where freedom
of thought is suppressed.
In a speech prepared for deliv
ery at the Watertown First Pres
byterian Church which is celebrat
ing its 150 th anniversary, Dulles'
decried those in this country who
would give "an absolute priority
to material efforts."
"There arc others who honestly
feel that the danger is so imminent
that we should impose uniformity of
thought, or at least of expression,
abolishing diversity and tolerance
within our nation and within our
alliances," he said.
"Such points of view, while often
heard, represent a small minority,"
he asserted. "Certainly, there is some
confusion of thinking, which needs
to be dispelled. But I believe that
the great majority of the American
peoples and of their representatives
in government still accept the words
of the prophet:
"'Not by might nor by power,
but by my spirit, saith tlx- Lord of
Hosts. "
Dules warned that the United
States should not "assume the like
ness" of Communism in fighting the
Red menace. The "greatest weak
ness" of Russia's leaders, he said, is
that they are "professed material
ists."
