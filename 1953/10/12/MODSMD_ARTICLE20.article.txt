# Churchill's Familiar Appeal
## 
### 
Winston Churchill—British prime minister
and world statesman—last week, when ad
dressing a convention of his Conservative
Party, again voiced his familiar appeal for a
meeting of the major powers for a discussion of
world tensions.
i
His appeal—it seems to us—is a wise one
nnd deserves the careful appraisal of the men
charged with the conduct of our foreign affairs.
For, as he said so pointedly, such a meeting
certainly can do no harm and might possibly
do great good.
The diplomatic advantages that might pos
sibly be wrung from such a meeting by either
side in the Cold War conflict admittedly might
be slim.
But, as Churchill said, such a meeting might
calm present exaggerated fears and lead to at
least a five or ten year respite in Cold War
tensions, during which time more deliberate
efforts at achieving permanent peace can be
attempted.
The world needs patience, he said. "It needs
a period of calm rather than vehement attempts
to produce clear-cut solutions. . .
Churchill's plan calls for a meeting of the
Big Four—United States, Great Britain, France,
and Russia—that will be conducted«-on as in
formal basis as is possible.

And such a meeting, he claimed, his char
acteristic optimism evident, might not only
calm fears but also "might lead to something
still better."
That such a wise and practiced diplomat as
Churchill should see hope in a world dismal
with fear and suspicion should be ample invi
tation in itself to beckon our policy makene to a
conference table.
Critics of such a course will, no doubt, find
many excuses for our not participating. They'll
most likely use the thread-worn arguments that
a meeting of the kind suggested will only pro
vide the Russians with another international
megaphone for their propaganda; or that, if
the meeting is a failure, tempers throughout
the world would harden, preventing any fur
ther attempts at agreement.
Such ostrich-like conduct of hiding our head
from world problems as recommended by
these critics seems entirely out of place today,
particularly now that active international co
operation seems to be the only available ave
nue to peace.
We hope that our diplomatic leaders—Presi
dent Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dul
les—will consider Churchill's proposal open
mindedly and will see the possible, though
certainly not promised, good that might stem
from such a get together.
