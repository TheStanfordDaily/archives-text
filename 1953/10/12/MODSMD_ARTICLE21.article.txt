### DICK MANSFIELD 
INSPECTOR FAUGH AND THE MOVING FINGER
The Committee for Maintenance and Beautification
ol (he Flora and Culture of Stanford —in short, Palm
(!om—mot in the darkest corner of tfre Nitery one day
to discuss the problem of pranksters. The matter of

devil's head once placed on Me
morial Church was pondered. The
11it'll schoolers who annually paint
f'AL in big blue letters somewhere
on Quad were mentioned in dark
terms. "To Hell With '56" stirred
ejaculation. Finally a member
arose with a motion. In fact, how
el.se could he rise?
Fellow Beautifiers," he said.
"This ease is too big for mortal
man! Let's demand an investiga-

tion by that hawk-eyed hawkshaw, Wadleigh Faugh!"
The assenting clamor was overwhelming.
Within a few hours intrepid Wadleigh Faugh ar
rived and took up a position behind a palm in Inner
Quad. The night was dark; the moon was down.
Somewhere a daschund bayed. Faugh shivered in his
cloak. There came a furtive footstep, and the sound
ot someone whistling a little allegro con brio, pianis
simo. From behind his palm leaped Wadleigh Faugh,
1 tuncheon in hand. The prowler was a thin youth
wearing thick glasses. "What are you doing, and who
are you?" snarled Faugh.
I am a Phy Sci major, studying the wonders of as
tronomy," returned the youth. "Beyond that, sirrah, I
am a gentleman and a scholar!"
Schizophrenia," growled Faugh, who had seen the

word in a racy novel. He gave the youth a ticket to [
Men's Council's next night game,.and proceeded to
another palm tree.
Within moments, his clammy grip had fallen on
another interloper. They scuffled in the dark, Faugh
eventually gaining the lower hand and sinking into
the muck. His quarry dragged him forth; "I say," he j
said, "Are you chipper? Hope I didn't bruise you, old
thing!" This time it was an English exchange student, '
going to a meeting of lIP. Faugh collected himself and [
melted into the night.
In a leafy bower sat a lonely maid, a Ventura -girl
and prim, humming sadly to herself. An occasional
tear fell on the wilted daisy she clutched in her hand.
"Ah, Whispering Hope!" she cried, "Come and find this
lovelorn child!"
A shape loomed up.
"Are you Whispering Hope?" she sighed, tearing
a petal from the daisy.
"I'm Wadleigh Faugh," snapped the shape, "and I'll
say what I please."
At the crack of dawn, Wadleigh Faugh reported to
the chairman of Palm Com. "Montmorency," he said,
"this thing is bigger than both of us. All night long I '
stalked the quagmire of Inner Quad, putting the pinch
on anyone who came in sight. They all pleaded in
nocent. Not a sign of pranksterism! Were it conceiv- j
able, I'd say I'm baffled!"
"But Faugh!" said Montmorency, "There's some- |
thing painted on the back of your cloak! The paint is
still wet!"
Faugh winced. "What does it say?"
"It says," said Montmorency, " 'Wadleigh Faugh's
a horse's neck!'"

word in a racy novel. He gave the youth a ticket to [
Men's Council's next night game,.and proceeded to
another palm tree.
Within moments, his clammy grip had fallen on
another interloper. They scuffled in the dark, Faugh
eventually gaining the lower hand and sinking into
the muck. His quarry dragged him forth; "I say," he j
said, "Are you chipper? Hope I didn't bruise you, old
thing!" This time it was an English exchange student, '
going to a meeting of lIP. Faugh collected himself and [
melted into the night.
In a leafy bower sat a lonely maid, a Ventura -girl
and prim, humming sadly to herself. An occasional
tear fell on the wilted daisy she clutched in her hand.
"Ah, Whispering Hope!" she cried, "Come and find this
lovelorn child!"
A shape loomed up.
"Are you Whispering Hope?" she sighed, tearing
a petal from the daisy.
"I'm Wadleigh Faugh," snapped the shape, "and I'll
say what I please."
At the crack of dawn, Wadleigh Faugh reported to
the chairman of Palm Com. "Montmorency," he said,
"this thing is bigger than both of us. All night long I '
stalked the quagmire of Inner Quad, putting the pinch
on anyone who came in sight. They all pleaded in
nocent. Not a sign of pranksterism! Were it conceiv- j
able, I'd say I'm baffled!"
"But Faugh!" said Montmorency, "There's some- |
thing painted on the back of your cloak! The paint is
still wet!"
Faugh winced. "What does it say?"
"It says," said Montmorency, " 'Wadleigh Faugh's
a horse's neck!'"

to discuss the problem of pranksters. The matter of

devil's head once placed on Me
morial Church was pondered. The

f'AL in big blue letters somewhere
on Quad were mentioned in dark
terms. "To Hell With '56" stirred
ejaculation. Finally a member

el.se could he rise?
Fellow Beautifiers," he said.
"This ease is too big for mortal
man! Let's demand an investiga-

tion by that hawk-eyed hawkshaw, Wadleigh Faugh!"
The assenting clamor was overwhelming.
Within a few hours intrepid Wadleigh Faugh ar
rived and took up a position behind a palm in Inner
Quad. The night was dark; the moon was down.
Somewhere a daschund bayed. Faugh shivered in his
cloak. There came a furtive footstep, and the sound
ot someone whistling a little allegro con brio, pianis
simo. From behind his palm leaped Wadleigh Faugh,
1 tuncheon in hand. The prowler was a thin youth
wearing thick glasses. "What are you doing, and who
are you?" snarled Faugh.
I am a Phy Sci major, studying the wonders of as
tronomy," returned the youth. "Beyond that, sirrah, I
am a gentleman and a scholar!"
