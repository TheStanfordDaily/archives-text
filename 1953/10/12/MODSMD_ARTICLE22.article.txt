## Gubser and His Homework 
### 
To the Editor:
A lew days ago, I attended a joint meeting of the
.lanford and Palo Alto Young Republican Clubs.
Their speaker was Congressman Charles S. Gubser.
Glibber stated that he was in favor of the Status of
Forces Treaty.
The Status of Forces Treaty gives foreign countries
the right to try American servicemen in foreign courts,
before foreign juries (if there are juries), under for
eign law, and risk foreign punishments. The treaty
takes away the protection of the American Constitu
tion and American law and gives jurisdiction of the
American servicemen to foreign courts.
While favoring the Status of Forces Treaty, Gub
nei's remarks indicated that he misread the treaty or

did not road it at all. Either way, Congressman Gub
ser did not know what ho was talking about.
Gubser had stated that if we believe a soldier's rights
will he abrogated we "may yank him out" and try him
under American law. I have read the treaty several
times and the above mentioned provision is not con
tained in the treaty. Contrary to wfyit Gubser had
stated, there are no adequate safeguards for our serv
icemen. Mr. Gubser: you can fool some of the people
some of the time, but you can't fool all of the people
all of the time.
I would suggest that Gubser read the documents he
so freely discusses and that he report them correctly.
Gubser had better catch up on his homework!
