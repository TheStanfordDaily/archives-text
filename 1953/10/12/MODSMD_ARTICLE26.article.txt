Buried among innumerable
pages of the Stanford registra
tion book is the Honor Code
pledge.
The blank line appearing on this
page is often so hurriedly filled in
by the registrant that often the
printed material is not even read.

The student hasn't even realized
that by the simple action of signing
his name in that space, he is taking
advantage of one of the greatest
privileges Stanford offers.
The Council lor Student Control
is the judicial body that handles
violations of the Honor Code.
There are two divisions in the
Council for Student Control: Men's
Council, composed of five men, of
which Tom El lick is the chairman,
and Women's Council, consisting of
five women, whose chairman is
Carol Folsom.
These two Councils sit as one, and
tny all cases involving violations of
the Honor Code. Cases involving
violations by women students of the
Fundamental Standard and social
regulations are heard by Women's
Council alone, and Men's Council
alone handles violations of the Fun
damental Standard by men stu
dents.
The Council is a judiciary body
and does not establish changes, nor
participate in education regarding
the Honor Code. These functions
are handled by the Fundamental
Standard Committee.
No faculty or administration
members are present at these hear
ings. The identity of the defendant
and the witness and the record of

the hearing is kept in strict confi
dence.
The witness does not face the de
fendant, but each meets separately
with the Council. The decision of
the Council may be appealed to the
administration.
The Council members also meet
to discuss their approach to ques
tioning witnesses and defendants,
and the importance of precedent in
making decisions.
The Council feels that the most
important part of the Honor Code
system is the third person respon
sibility, since without it there prob
ably would be little the Council or
anyone else could do in enforcing
the Code.
Also, it is all too easy just to sign
one's name after the statement, "I
have not given nor received any un
permitted aid," which is printed on
all mid-terms and finals given at
Stanford.
The Council thinks that if, at the
end of an examination, students
were required to write this state
ment, and then sign it, the meaning
would penetrate more effectively.
