# Campus Parking Remains Problem
## 
### 
Campus parking is still a major
problem, Campus Police Chief Gor
don Davis has reported.
Biggest point of congestion, Davis
said, is behind the library between
9 a.m. and noon. A number of cita
tions have been given to drivers
who double-park or park illegally
in that lot. Students finding the lot
full should park in the triangular
lot adjacent to Stern, Davis said.
Students who have not yet regis
tered their cars may get stickers in
the Police Department office, lo
cated in the Corporation Yard.
