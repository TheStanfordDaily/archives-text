# Italy Believes Tito 'Bluffing'

ROME, Oct. 11 (UP)â€”The Italian
defense ministry said today it was
withholding plans to move Italian
troops into the Allied held zone of
Trieste until the Americans and Brit
ish set a date for the withdrawal of
their forces.
The Allies in Thursday night's an
nouncement said they were turning
over zone A of the Trieste territory
at the "earliest practicable date."
This was the only "catch" in
their promise to Italy, hut today it
appeared it would give the Ameri
can and British time to determine
how much truth there is in Mar
shal Tito's threat to move troops
into the Allied-held zone of Tri
este if it is turned over to Italy,
diplomatic sources in Rome said.
Also they were waiting to see what
the American and British reaction
would be to Tito's virtual ultimatum
in presenting a new plan for the par
titioning of Trieste and then warning
there would "be no peace in this
part of the world" unless the Allies
accepted the proposal.
Italy remains unanimous in favor
of accepting the Allied Trieste de
cision, but the Communists and their
allies think the Anglo-American de
cision "dangerous."
