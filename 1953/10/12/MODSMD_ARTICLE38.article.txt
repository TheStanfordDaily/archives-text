## 
### 
DETROIT, Oct. 11 (UP)â€”The De
troit Lions gained sole possession of
j first place in their division of the
j National Football League today by
I squeezing past the San Francisco
\ '49ers, 24 to 21, before a record
crowd of 58,079 at Briggs Stadium.
The '49ers were badly hurt by the
loss of quarterback Y. A. Tittle, who
j may have suffered a broken jaw
when he rounded right end in the
third period for the losers' third and
last touchdown. After Tittle was
removed from the game the '49ers'
defense failed to click and wasted
several last-quarter scoring oppor
tunities.
Detroit took a quick 10-0 lead in
: the opening minutes, but the '49ers
! came roaring on a Y. A. Tittle to
J Gordie Soltau pass to make the
score 10-7 at the end of the first
1 quarter.
Early in the second quarter they
went ahead on Joe Arenas' 10-yard
dash, but the Lions came back with
touchdowns by Bob Hoei nschemey
er and Leon Hart to make it 24-12.
Then Tittle scored his touchdown,
and the '49eis were through for the
day.
