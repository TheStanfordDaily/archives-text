# Booters Best CCSF by 2-0
## 
### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
In spite of Saturday morning's
sudden downpour, and in spite of
the stiff opposition put up by City
College of San Francisco, the
Stanford soccer varsity, looking
extremely sharp after only a
week's practice, swept to a deci
sive 2-0 victory over the mud
spattered city lads.
A beautiful long shot by freshman
Peter Mack, when the game was
only five minutes old, gave the red
and white rooters a mathematical
and mental edge they never gave
up. even when the muddy field
seemed more environmental to the
boys from S.F. Midway in the third
quarter, left inside Sam Suarez
banged through a second goal, and
the Indians breathed easy.
It was the defense, however,
which stole the show last Satur
day, as they kept the CCSF for
ward line, led by the dangerous
Al Martinez, completely at bay.
The goal, defended by Ken
Woods, was seldom â€¢in danger.
Only once or twice did Ken have
to extend himself.
Co - captain John Sentous and
center halfback Derek Liecty led
the de efnsive effort. Fullback Sen
tous was booting everything in sight
a country mile, while Liecty wasn't
even giving Martinez room to
breathe in.
Credit also must go to the rest of
the defensive players, John Hanna,
Sam Register, Peter Mack, and Don
Yates, all of whom performed well.
Offensively, the Card attack,
sparked by Suarez and Chuck An
drews, formerly from S.F. State,
kept the pressure on all game long,
and with a few breaks would have
gathered several more goals.
Coach Leo Weinstein was very
well pleased with the opening
day's effort, and he is looking for
ward to next week's encounter
with S.F. State, which will be the
first soccer game ever played in
Stanford Stadium.
