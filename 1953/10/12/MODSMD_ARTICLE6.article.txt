BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Oct. 11 (UP)—Marshall Tito warned to
day that Yugoslav troops will march into zone A of Trieste "the
moment an Italian enters."
It was his second speech in two days bitterly protesting the
Anglo-American decision to turn over zone A of the disputed

territory to Italy.
Yesterday Tito announced he had
sent troops into Yugoslav-controlled
Zone Band that any Italian move
into Zone A would be considered
"an act of aggression."
"Yugoslavia will keep a sharp eye
on every Italian movement and the
moment the Italians enter Zone A
Yugoslavia will enter the zone, too,"
he told a wildly cheering crowd of
250.000 at Skoplje today.
Yugoslavs demonstrated through
(lie country in the fourth day of
protests against the U.S.-British
decision. Police reinforcements
kept the crowds in check and
there were no more attacks on the
Western embassies which were
stoned Thursday.
Tito warned the West it would
lose Yugoslavia's friendship and en
danger "peace in this part of the
world" if the decision is not with
drawn.

He noted that "some responsible
people in the West" had proposed
cutting off aid to Yugoslavia if it did
not agree to Italian entry into Zone
A. He said Yugoslavia was willing
to undergo greater sacrifices than
that.
He asked the Western powers
to reverse their decision and
"realize their delusion," and re
peated that Yugoslavia would
bring the matter up in the United
Nations if necessary.
Tito declared the West should not
"sacrifice such an important thing
as devotion and love of the Yugo
slav people for peace" to induce
Italy to ratify the European army
agreement.
"Italy has signed various agree
ments, various alliances countless
times and broken them," he said.
"The European defense community
will neither gain nor lose by the
Italian signatures.
"I consider that the Western Al
lies should realize that the Italian
actions are plain blackmail."

LONDON, Oct. 11 (UP) —The \
British Foreign Ollice said today j
it would consult "immediately" j
with the United States and France
on Yugoslavia's threat to send
troops into the Allied zone of
Trieste if Italian forces move in.
The British Foreign Ollice I
spokesman emphasized, however, I
that the three-power considcra- ;
tion of Marshal Tito's threat ,
would he through "normal chan- i
ncls."
