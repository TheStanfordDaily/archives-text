## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Oct. 11 (UP)—The United Nations
probably will agree to Red proposals for talks at Panmunjom to
make arangements for a Korean peace conference, highly-quali
fied United Nations sources said today.
These sources said, however, that American acceptance would

♦not in any way commit the U.S.
to dropping its opposition to Ihe j
Red demand that the conference
i be expanded into a round table af- |
fair by inviting India* and other i
Asian neutrals to attend.
On the other hand, they said, the
opening of direct talks would at |
least remove the issue from the U.N. j
forum and get the .two sides one j
step closer to the peace conference J
| itself. Under the Panmunjom truce
pact, the parley is supposed to get
under way by Oct. 28.
A formal American reply was not
expected before late tomorrow, after I
return of Secretary of State John
Foster Dulles from Watertown,
N.Y., where he was speaking to- j
night. J
