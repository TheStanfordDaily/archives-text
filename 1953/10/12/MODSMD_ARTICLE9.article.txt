MUNSAN, Monday. Oct. 12 (UP)
—The United Nations announced
today that it would complete its ex
planation site for prisoners of war
and be ready to start interviews
with balky captives by Oct. 21 "at
the latest."
The U.N. command made the
statement after the Neutral Nations
Repatriations Commission called a
meeting in hopes of getting the
long - delayed explanations to the
prisoners started by Wednesday.
The Communists were expected to
make new demands that the period
be extended as long as the delay.
However, that proposal has been
rejected by the United Nations ea<#i
time it has been offered.
The possibility was growing that
the whole subject might have to be
worked out in the post-armistice
political conference, a procedure
which could add months to the cur
rent delay. The explanations al
ready have been delayed 17 days.
