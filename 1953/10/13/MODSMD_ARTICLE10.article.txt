WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 (UP) â€”
Assistant Defense Secretary John A.
Hannah said today American forces
in Korea are rushing work on a
powerful new defense line "because
there is the possibility of renewing
the shooting."
He added the United States will
not reduce its forces in Korea until
it is "certain" the Communists ac
tually want peace.
Hannah also said it has been de
cided to maintain U.S. combat forces
at about present strength "for an
indefinite period." He said cuts in
strength plannted before the Korean
truce would leave a total force of
about 3,360.000 men at the end of
this year, compared to about 3,560,-
000 at the year's start.
