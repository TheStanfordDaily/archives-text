## North Analyzes Red China Tactics 
### BARBARA TUERK 
"The Communists will not expect ]
a negotiated peace to succeed, but |
they will bend every effort toward j
making it serve their purposes, j
Talking peace, they will try to block
the United States at every possible
juncture, giving way for tactical
purposes only."
So concludes Robert C. North, re
search associate at the Hoover In
stitute now studying in India, whose
book, "Moscow and Chinese Com
munists." has recently been released
by the Stanford Press and is now on
sale at the Stanford Bookstore.
Basing his analysis of past,
present, and future relations be
tween Russia and China on a
thorough study of basic Commu
nist strategy as outlined both in
traditional Communist theory and
in the speeches of Mao Tsc-tung
and other leading Chinese Com
munists, North offers little hope
that the Chinese may be content
to stop midway on their march to
total dominance over Asia.
Under North's scrutiny, the un
wavering purpose behind the devi
ous twistings of Mao and his Agra
rian reformers" becomes painfully
clear.
What many Westerners and most
Asians do not understand, he ex
plains, is that "within its rigid dog
matic framework, Communist the
ory and practice allow considerable,
sometimes almost paradoxical, flu
idity of action."
So. he believes, excent for tern

porary tactical and propaganda pur
poses, it will not make a great dif
ference to the. Chinese Communists
whether the United States will, or
will not, decide to recognize their
regime. Their plans are set far too
definitely to be affected by minor
strategical decisions, be explains.
Yet while handing a strong warn- I
ing. to those who have fallen for |
Mao's protestations of peaceful in
tent, North, an editorialist for the I
Pacific Spectator, is quick to rebuke
those Americans who believe that |
an atom bomb or an embargo on j
China's mainland will solve our Far j
Eastern problems.
"Asia today is grinding through
one of those changes in cycle, one j
of those stupendous, nearly un
controllable upheavals that some- j
times bury the mighty and raise
the lowly to high places . . . ," |
he says."The problem of free
peoples in both Asia and the West,
then, is to adjust to the funda
mental upheaval and live with it
and guide it without allowing
themselves to he destroyed."
North does not share the popular
American hope that Mao may turn
"Titoist." Although he discusses at
length the very real differences be
tween China and Russia which
might eventually lead to dissension,
he believes that for now Russia and
China will remain closely united by
their common determination to
drive the West out of Asia.
Therefore, he believes, "We must
expect th>' Communists to continue

their policy of 'fight and talk, talk
and fight.' Concurrently, the Com
munists may be expected to con
tinue their promotion of revolution
in the various colonial and semi-co
lonial areas, implanting Communist
ideas, building united fronts with
non-Comrhunist groups, and seek
ing to crystallize their forces.
"Wherever possible, they are
likely to offer camouflaged sup
port (amis, supplies, 'advisers'),
rather than commit their forces to
overt participation. The Russians,
and perhaps also the Chinese, will
be inclined to hold Soviet forces
strictly in reserve . . . ." he con
tinues.
And finally North believes that
efforts will be made to open trade
channels and to sow dissension
among the Allies, "especially be
tween the United States and Great
Britain and the United States and
the various Asian nations, particu
larly Japan and India."
What can the West do to halt the
powerful drive of the Communist
Chinese into Southeast Asia?
North offers no clear-cut easy
formula solution to the Far East
ern dilemma. Indeed, he believes
that "the West, being free and dem
ocratic, cannot offer a total system
with a 'solution' for every problem,
and even if it could, the people of
Asia would be in no mood for ac
ceptance."
But he does offer hope that the
peoples of Western and Asi'in na
tions might work together in a

"joint program of liberation from
ignorance, poverty, and fear to un
dercut the Communist appeal in
Asia . .
More specifically, he recommends:
1. That private institutions en
courage international understand
ing by trading ideas and tech
niques and individuals with Asian
nations.
2. That Western governments
offer a "carefully worked out and
fully integrated program of po
litical and technical and econom
ic co-operation" to rival the clear
cut program of action offered by
the Communists.
Thai Western nations set def
inite dates for turning remaining
colonial areas into independent
republics.
4. That these new lands be pro
tected by international military
force.
North, a novelist as well as a his
torian, concludes his study with a
ringing appeal to the people of the
United States not to "deny our own
freedoms in a frenzy of masochism
and introspective fear."
Referring to this summer's East
Berlin rebels who fought Russian
tanks with stones, he says, "We can
lend sympathy and aid and inspira
tion to the stone throwers of tomor
row (East or West, wherever they
may rise up against the totalitarian
master) â€”but only if we love free
flnm *"* e Hnnplv ro'iv f f T*
