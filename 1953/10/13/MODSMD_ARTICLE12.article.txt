# Yugoslavia Demands Talks To Settle Trieste Dispute
## 
### 
BELGRADE, Oct.* 12 (UP)â€”Yugoslavia today demanded a four
power conference on the Trieste crisis and appealed to the United
Nations to step in if the meeting fails to stamp out the "danger to
peace."
Marshal Tito moved with dramatic abruptness an hour after a
Yugoslav mob broke into the U.S>

It said failure of both the con
ference and the appeal would mean
that Yugoslavia would "have re
course to self - defense with all
available means."
Both the note and the appeal re
jected the decision announced by
the United States and Great Britain
to withdraw their troops from Zone
A of the Trieste territory and turn
it over to Italy.
An hour after handing the note
to the Anglo - American envoys,
Bebler called in the Italian min
ister, Duke Paolo Vanni d'Arehi
rafi, to inform him of its contents.
Still half an hour later. Soviet
Ambassador Vassily Valkov called
at the Yugoslav foreign oilice at his
own request.
Tito uncorked his swift diplomatic
offensive as Yugoslav warships were
ported standing off Zone B of
Trieste, and both Yugoslavia and
Italy were reported reinforcing their
troops in the area.
The U.S. destroyer New rode at
anchor in Trieste Harbor. Capt.
Leonard F. Friburghouse. com
mander of the U.S. Sixth Fleet
destroyer squadron, visited offi
cials ashore. The New arrived
last night.
The beating of King was the grav
est incident involving Anglo-Amer
icans since the Western decision on
Trieste touched off clamorous pro
tests, non-stop demonstrations, and
flurries of violence against Ameri
can and British officers here.

Information Service offices and beat
an American diplomat, William B. |
King. The U.S. embassy promptly ,
lodged a stern protest. (
Chanting demonstrators marched | ;
in bands of 100 to 200 through the
streets of Belgrade for the fifth j j
straight day, ignoring chill rain t
squalls and lashing wind. I
A formal note proposing thp con- j '
ference of Yugoslavia, the United i 1
States, Britain, and Italy was deliv- i
ered at noon by Deputy Foreign j
Secretary Ales Bebler to Woodruff '
Wallner, U.S. charge d'affaires, and 1
Sir Ivo Mallet, Britiish ambassador. 1
At the same time Tito's gov
ernment telegraphed an appeal
direct to Dag Hammarskjold. Sec- ,
retary-General of the U.N.
