### PETE GROTHE 
TUESDAY MORNING JOTTINGS

FLY IN THE OINTMENT. Phil Wilson, the Indians'
hard-hitting guard, has an idiosyncracy. When he
runs down the field on a kick-off, he has his mouth
wide open. This habit never got Phil into any trouble

until the Illinois game.
Against the Illini, Wilson was
chugging down the field on the
kick-off, showing his tonsils to
everyone, as usual. This wouldn't
have been so bad, except that
there was a fly buzzing around on
llie 50 yard line. Open gullet and
fly met, and Phil gagged.
Phil implored the referees to
112 all a time out, because he could
not catch his breath. None of the

zebra shirts would sympathize with him, except one,
v/ho it turns out, also once gagged on a fly.
And so time was called out and 40,000 people waited
while Phil disentangled the bewildered fly from his
esophagus.
As poet Ogden Nash once philosophized:
"God, in hLs wisdom, made the fly,
And then forgot to tell us why."

C'EST LA GIIERRE. Richie Meyers, joker, man
about-campus, and good guy, is a man unique in
Stanford draftdom. Last spring, Richie was ushered
off the campus to his native Brooklyn by the draft
board. It appeared' to be the end of Richie.
But Richie protested the draft notice. He protested
so long and so loud that he was given a direct appeal
to the President.
Says Richie, "O'h, I know that Eisenhower will
never accept the appeal, but by the time he gets to
it, I'll already have graduated from Stanford.
HISTORICAL ACCURACY. A 1 Napoleon, nifty
Ail-American JC halfback from Compton College,
scored a touchdown for the Stanford Braves against
the Cal Ramblers last Saturday. A sportswriter for
one of the City papers effected a juxtaposition of a
historical name and credited the score to a Joe Bona
parte.
STANFORD SPORTS TOME ON SALE. Because of
numerous requests, "Great Moments in Stanford
Sports" will go on sale mainly for frosh and transfer
students this Thursday. Only 300 copies remain and
will be sold on a first come, first serve basis. Many
of the copies will be autographed by Coach Chuck
Taylor arid Jack Shepard, who will be the Pittsburg
Pirates' first string catcher next year.
