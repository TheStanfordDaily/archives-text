# CAMPUS OPINION
## Following the Party Line 
### 
To the Editor:
The Daily politicos are following the party line
again. The time-honored theory that political criti
rism must be optimistic in inverse proportions to the
pessimism, that is indicated in the news columns, was
boosted as The Daily looked for clouds of glory
breaking a new dawn in international relations. The
editors evidently feel secure in following the ancient
.sage who knew enough to wait writing his memoirs
until the only person who could contradict him was
dead. Because he sees hope in a dismal world, ergo,
there must be some there was the point made by an
editorial in the paper Monday.
Ah, but did not the editors read about "The war
we do not want" two years back, and didn't they sigh
with three million other Amrcieans, "Whew! I'm
glad we won that one." If not that, has not the grow
ing numbers of ROTC uniforms on campus introduced
spasmodic thoughts about militarism in higher edu
cation; or is that too esoteric a consideration to be
wasting time on when there are dances to be planned
and beer to drink? If it is, perhaps the buzzing jets
or the atomic stockpile talk, or the CD program, or
(lie expansion of radar defenses, has prompted stray
thoughts thai the U.S. is preparing for all-out war;

that Russia is preparing for all out war; that only at
the present are both of them willing that stool pigeons
like North and South Korea, either of the factions in
Indo China, India, Italy, Yugoslavia do the fighting.
But when we light the fuse, can we prevent an ex
plosion. Please note Mr. Rhee.
It is the politicians' job to be optimistic; for they
must gain popular support if they are to remain in
office; optimism is popular. But it is the newspaper
editors' task to be realistic, and, yes, hypercritical.
Editor Pollyanna never stimulated a thought in her
life, and she never did much for the politics of the
world, either. She has written Kellogg Pacts, granted
Munich sell-outs and wiped out thousands of unac
counted prisoners of war, but she'has never made
peace.
If we go to meet the Ivans and the Igors, let us go
with our best diplomatic weapon, a realistic mind,
and come back, if not with a sound non-aggression
pact, then with the solid awareness that Russia would
not have one except on her terms. Let us not take a
pact just so the "in's" can stay in next November, or
so newspaper editors can continue to hoodwink their
readers with glib talk of peace and hope.
