# The 						Dog Detail
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Concerning your reference to the Phi Sig watchdog
as being "unable to help," let me point it out as only
another example of our modern civilization which has
lost the sense of the romantic. If by '"helping" you
mean only building bridges or painting barns, he was
not (though his brethern were probably inside paint
ing the dining room), but if you will consider "help
ing" in the broader sense of contributing to life and to
civilization, taken not only as enduring monuments of
pij-' iron and Portland cement but as also evidenced in
lln- moving stream of history acting on human per
• onality, I believe his actions to be most significant.
To put it simply, he was painting smiles on faces—
in my mind an occupation of great worth, for it is
not our engineering accomplishments which dis
tinguish us from the beasts, hut rather our ability
(o laugh.
II The Daily reporter had chosen to sit for a bit
and watch the stream of life passing by these cross
roads, he would have seen the laughter, smiles, and
ometimes horseplay of students on their way from
class, of professors and truckdrivers returning from
their day's labors, of housewives going about their
marketing chores, and lastly but by no means leastly,
ill the children—who sat and watched, who waved.and
laughed, delighted that at last some grown-ups were
seeing things with their eyes. It would be presump
tuous to follow this line further.

The dog detail then brought a moment of gladness
and relief to all who went by—except to passing
dogs, to a few youngsters" who threw rocks until
"Fido" was sicked on them, and to a few "stone
faces." It is only in their hearts that we can meas
ure what "help" this beastie was to them, but oc
casionally their hearts were in their eyes, and we
know.
You notice that the list of exceptions does not in
clude the ex-pledges, for the dog detail was a popular
one. Their anonymity allowed them to thoroughly
enter their roles with heart-warming results.
In these dark days of human civilization, let me
stand up for the things which cannot be measured,
for - the moment when all can be measured in material
terms will he the moment of doom for our race.

To the Editor:
Concerning your reference to the Phi Sig watchdog
as being "unable to help," let me point it out as only
another example of our modern civilization which has
lost the sense of the romantic. If by '"helping" you
mean only building bridges or painting barns, he was
not (though his brethern were probably inside paint
ing the dining room), but if you will consider "help
ing" in the broader sense of contributing to life and to
civilization, taken not only as enduring monuments of
pij-' iron and Portland cement but as also evidenced in
lln- moving stream of history acting on human per
• onality, I believe his actions to be most significant.
To put it simply, he was painting smiles on faces—
in my mind an occupation of great worth, for it is
not our engineering accomplishments which dis
tinguish us from the beasts, hut rather our ability
(o laugh.
II The Daily reporter had chosen to sit for a bit
and watch the stream of life passing by these cross
roads, he would have seen the laughter, smiles, and
ometimes horseplay of students on their way from
class, of professors and truckdrivers returning from
their day's labors, of housewives going about their
marketing chores, and lastly but by no means leastly,
ill the children—who sat and watched, who waved.and
laughed, delighted that at last some grown-ups were
seeing things with their eyes. It would be presump
tuous to follow this line further.

The dog detail then brought a moment of gladness
and relief to all who went by—except to passing
dogs, to a few youngsters" who threw rocks until
"Fido" was sicked on them, and to a few "stone
faces." It is only in their hearts that we can meas
ure what "help" this beastie was to them, but oc
casionally their hearts were in their eyes, and we
know.
You notice that the list of exceptions does not in
clude the ex-pledges, for the dog detail was a popular
one. Their anonymity allowed them to thoroughly
enter their roles with heart-warming results.
In these dark days of human civilization, let me
stand up for the things which cannot be measured,
for - the moment when all can be measured in material
terms will he the moment of doom for our race.
