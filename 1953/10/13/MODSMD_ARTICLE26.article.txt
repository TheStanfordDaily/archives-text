## 
### NAN CERINI 
Dr. Frank Charles Laubach, literacy specialist for World Liter
acy, Inc., will speak on his methods of teaching illiterates to read
at 4:15 p.m. today in the Women's Clubhouse. The talk will be
open to the public.
According to Dr. Laubach, "The most bruised people on this

planet, the naked, the fallen-among
thieves, the sick, the imprisoned in
mind and soul, are the 1.2 billion
illiterates. More than half the hu
man race is hungry, driven, dis
eased, afraid of educated men in
this world and of demons in the
next."
It is these people for whom Dr.
Laubach has devoted his»life. World
Literacy, Inc., estimates that at least
GO million people have learned to
read by the Laubach method or
adaptations of it.
Frank Laubach was born in Ben
ton, Penn., in 1884. He was edu
cated at Perkiomen Seminary,
Princeton University, Union Theo
logical Seminary, and Columbia
University.
In 1915 he and his wife went to
the Philippines as missionaries for
the American Board of Commis
sioners for Foreign Missions.
Fourteen years later he went, at
his own request, to Mindanao Is
land where the Moros, a fanatical
Moslem people, live in the moun
tains near Lake Lanao.
He learned to speak the Moros'
Maranaw language and helped put
it in writing. Then, with the help
of a Filipino educator, Donato Galia,
he worked out the first edition of
his picture - syllable - word literacy
charts. Since then Dr. Laubach has
been responsible for producing
charts in 239 languages and dialects,
for 68 countries.
Literacy teachers at first were
paid workers, but a shortage of
funds started the literacy campaign
slogan, "Each One Teach One." The
work on Mindanao became a mod
el for other parts of the Philippines
and then for the rest of the world,
as missionaries in India, Malaya,
Africa, and the Middle East learned
to construct the new literacy charts.
With Dr. Laubach's new methods
people could learn to read simple
sentences in less than two weeks,
whereas most of the old systems
took months.
In 1911!) he went to East Africa
at the request of the League of
Nations for a 50-day tour; during
World War II he visited nearly
every Latin American country.
He just returned from India
where he helped the Village De
velopment Program of the Indian
government by teaching modern
literacy methods and training
teachers of illiterates.
Dr. Laubach is known in Brazil
as "The Apostle to the Illiterates,"
in Cuba as "The Man with the
Flaming Heart, and in the Belgian
Congo as "Okombekombe" or
"Mender of Baskets." This last title
was given him because the illiter
ates there said they felt lik,e old
wornout baskets until Dr, Laubach

arrived among them and by teach
ing them to read transformed them
into useful citizens—more valuable

than their most prized possessions:
their homes and their finely woven
baskets.
World Literacy, Inc., was organ
ized in 1951 to aid the Committee
on World Literacy and Christian
Literature in its promotion and ex
pansion of literacy and literature
production.
Dr. Laubach's appearance on cam
pus is -being sponsored by the Palo
Alto First Methodist Church and
the Special Visitors' Committee of
Memorial Church Committee.

DR. FRANK LAUBACH
—Literacy specialist
Dr. Frank Charles Laubach, literacy specialist for World Liter
acy, Inc., will speak on his methods of teaching illiterates to read
at 4:15 p.m. today in the Women's Clubhouse. The talk will be
open to the public.
According to Dr. Laubach, "The most bruised people on this

planet, the naked, the fallen-among
thieves, the sick, the imprisoned in
mind and soul, are the 1.2 billion
illiterates. More than half the hu
man race is hungry, driven, dis
eased, afraid of educated men in
this world and of demons in the
next."
It is these people for whom Dr.
Laubach has devoted his»life. World
Literacy, Inc., estimates that at least
GO million people have learned to
read by the Laubach method or
adaptations of it.
Frank Laubach was born in Ben
ton, Penn., in 1884. He was edu
cated at Perkiomen Seminary,
Princeton University, Union Theo
logical Seminary, and Columbia
University.
In 1915 he and his wife went to
the Philippines as missionaries for
the American Board of Commis
sioners for Foreign Missions.
Fourteen years later he went, at
his own request, to Mindanao Is
land where the Moros, a fanatical
Moslem people, live in the moun
tains near Lake Lanao.
He learned to speak the Moros'
Maranaw language and helped put
it in writing. Then, with the help
of a Filipino educator, Donato Galia,
he worked out the first edition of
his picture - syllable - word literacy
charts. Since then Dr. Laubach has
been responsible for producing
charts in 239 languages and dialects,
for 68 countries.
Literacy teachers at first were
paid workers, but a shortage of
funds started the literacy campaign
slogan, "Each One Teach One." The
work on Mindanao became a mod
el for other parts of the Philippines
and then for the rest of the world,
as missionaries in India, Malaya,
Africa, and the Middle East learned
to construct the new literacy charts.
With Dr. Laubach's new methods
people could learn to read simple
sentences in less than two weeks,
whereas most of the old systems
took months.
In 1911!) he went to East Africa
at the request of the League of
Nations for a 50-day tour; during
World War II he visited nearly
every Latin American country.
He just returned from India
where he helped the Village De
velopment Program of the Indian
government by teaching modern
literacy methods and training
teachers of illiterates.
Dr. Laubach is known in Brazil
as "The Apostle to the Illiterates,"
in Cuba as "The Man with the
Flaming Heart, and in the Belgian
Congo as "Okombekombe" or
"Mender of Baskets." This last title
was given him because the illiter
ates there said they felt lik,e old
wornout baskets until Dr, Laubach

arrived among them and by teach
ing them to read transformed them
into useful citizens—more valuable

than their most prized possessions:
their homes and their finely woven
baskets.
World Literacy, Inc., was organ
ized in 1951 to aid the Committee
on World Literacy and Christian
Literature in its promotion and ex
pansion of literacy and literature
production.
