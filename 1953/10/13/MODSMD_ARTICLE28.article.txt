(Editor's note: This is the sec-
Ond of a series of stories dealing
with the functions of leading stu
dent organizations.)

Every woman at Stanford is a
member of the vast organization
known as the Associated Wom
en Students.
AWS is an administrative body,
whose main purpose is to formulate
policy and act as a unifying agency
for women on campus. The govern
ing body of AWS is organized for
legislative and executive action, but
the real strength of the organization
lies in the active interest and par
ticipation of all women students.
Taking an active part in campus
affairs, AWS sponsors an annual
Leadership Conference, at which
administration officials speak to
leaders of all women's groups at
Stanford. Discussions on the re
sponsibilities of student government
and the operating of student organ
izations is included.
Perhaps the most important
j AWS function is the selecting of
| sponsors for freshmen and trans
fer students. Aspiring sponsors
are interviewed by a special hoard
in the spring. Those selected
spend one weekend off campus at
a sponsor conference.
AWS also presents a scholarship
cup each quarter to the residence
with the highest grade average. A
Nurses' Tea is traditionally given
for students of Stanford-Lane Hos
pital to meet and talk with campus
women interested in nursing.
The statewide AWS Conference,
representing 13 colleges, will be held
at Stanford this year.
Four standing committees are part
of AWS. Housing Committee is re
sponsible for the house drawing
process every quarter and for fresh
man orientation on women's hous
ing. The Social Regulations Com
mittee handles problems dealing
with women's social regulations.
The Scholarship Committee, which
presents the scholarship cup, and the
Sponsor Choosing Committee com
j plete the quartette.
Also included under the juris
diction of AWS is Cap and Gown,
the women's honorary society.
Officers for AWS this year are:
Jeannie King, president; Anne Ir
vine, vice-president; Sally Alabas
ter, secretary; Betty Barnes, social,
co - ordinator; and Betty Pierce,
treasurer.
