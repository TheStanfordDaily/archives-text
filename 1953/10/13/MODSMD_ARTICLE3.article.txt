COLUMBUS, 0., Oct. 12 (UP) —
Thomas A. Burke, outgoing mayor
of Cleveland, 0., tonight was named
to the U.S. Senate vacancy created
by the death of Sen. Robert A. Taft
to give the Democrats a plurality in
i the upper house of Congress.
Democratic Governor Frank J.
Lausche of Ohio named the 55-
year-old mayor of the nation's
seventh largest city to the seat
held by Taft, long known as "Mr.
Republican." Taft died of cancer
in New York July 31. He was 63.
The announcement was not made
personally by the Governor, but
came from his secretary here.
Lausche was in Cleveland for a
speaking engagement.
Appointment of a Democrat
made no change in control of
J Senate committees. It gave the
Democrats 48 members in the
Senate and the Republicans 47.
The 9(>th member is Sen. Wayne
Morse of Oregon, an independent.
But Morse has said he would join |
with the GOP on any organizational
vote at this session. This would
produce a tie which Vice-President
Richard M. Nixon would break isi
( favor of continued Republican or
ganization of the Senate.
Burke and Lausche are old politi- j
cal friends and co-workers. Burke 1
I was Lausche's law director in 1941 i
j when Lausche was mayor of Cleve- !
land. When Lausche ran success- |
fully for Governor in 1944, Burke
was elected mayor of Cleveland, a
job he has held for 12 years—longer
than any oilier Cleveland mayor.
Just a week ago Tuesday, Lausche
i and Burke found themselves on op
! posite sides of the fence in the
J Cleveland mayoralty race.
Burke had announced he would
| not seek re-election. He threw his
j support to William Porter, Cuya
hoga County engineer.
