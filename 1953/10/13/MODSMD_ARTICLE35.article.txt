LOS ANGELES, Oct. 12 (UP)â€”
Coach Henry (Red) Sanders can
didly claimed today that his current
UCLA football team is better than
the 1952 squad which came within
two points of a perfect season.
"We've got more power this
year," Sanders told the Southern
California Football Writers' Asso
ciation. "Don't forget that last
year Paul Cameron played only
!)0 minutes all season because of
injuries. lie's played that much
in four games this season."
With UCLA the only undefeated
team in Pacific Coast Conference
ranks and favored to go to the Rose
Bowl, Sanders refused to deprecate
either his team or players.
"We've got a much more versa
tile team this year. Last season,
with Cameron hurt, we fielded a
backfield that averaged about 180
pounds. This year, with Cameron
playing more and with Bob Daven
port at fullback, we have more de
ception and at the same time we get
more power," he said.
Sanders said that the Wieconsin
team his squad beat Friday night,
13 to 0, was the best team UCLA
had met this year.
"Wisconsin was just about as
tough this year as last. We had
an easier time beating them be
cause we've got a better offense
this year." he added.
Sanders said, however, that UC
LA was "concerned" over its game
with Stanford next Saturday and he
brought along scout George Dick
erson, who had been following the
Indians, to explain why. The UCLA
assistant coach pointed out that
Stanford should be judged off its
game against Illinois in which the
Palo Alto team outplayed the 111ini
for nearly three periods and then
wilted in the Midwestern heat.
