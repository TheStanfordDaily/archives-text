# Taylor: 'I Can't Pick Cards To Beat UCLA Saturday'

SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 12 (UP) |
—Coach Chuck Taylor of Stanford,
generally regarded as the world's j
most optimistic football coach, went J
into reverse gear today.
"At this time of the week I can
not pick Stanford to defeat UC
LA," Taylor said.
• Off the 1953 record, Taylor ad
mitted, his Stanford club should not j
be on the same field with the un
defeated Bruins.
"However, anything can happen
between now and Saturday," said |
Taylor. "We'll be 'up' for this game. 1
We always play well against UC- '
LA." *
Thus the stage was set for the |
titanic battle against the Bruins— !
the first main test of the year in j
the Pacific Coast Conference ranks
among top contenders for the Rose
Bowl bid.
Stanford, in pre - season dope
strictly a second division club, has
improved with every game—and
right now the UCLA coaches have
built up quite a fear for the In
dians.
"Coach Red Sanders," said Vic
Kelley, UCLA publicist, "before the
season started predicted that Stan
lord would have one of the best
lines on the Coast. He has seen
nothing to change mind since
that time."
Both the Bruins and the Indians
are unscored upon in conference
play — both having knocked over
Oregon and Oregon State. UCLA
won 12-0 and 41-0; Stanford won
7-0 and 21-0.
"Our passing department has
not been good this year," said
Kelly—and this is the one place
where Taylor agreed with him.
"It is the belief of our scouts,"
! said the Stanford coach, "that your
Paul Cameron throws a ball that is
rhard to hang onto."
Taylor admitted, however, that
1 Cameron was a great all-around
I ball-player.
The records show that Cameron
| leads the Bruins in six departments
—in yardage gained packing the
ball; in passing, punt returns, kick
off returns, pass interceptions, and
punting. It takes quite an all
around ball player to do that on
any squad.
The records also show that
UCLA has lost only one out of its
last IS /{ami's, It was held to a
! tie in 1951, 20-20, by Washington;
and last year lost the final game
of the season to USC, 14-12. Dur
j ing that time, the Bruins shut out
! the opposition in eight of the 18
| games; and in seven more the op

position got only one touchdown.
Taylor's qualified statement that
he "would not pick Stanford" leaves
room for a reversal of opinion if
his boys practice well this week.
