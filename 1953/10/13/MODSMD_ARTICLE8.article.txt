# Committee to Visit Farm In Quest of Stolen Axe
## 
### BOB REZAK Associate Editor, The Daily 
A group of students composing
the University of California's
newly appointed Axe - finding
committee is expected to descend
upon the Stanford campus this
weekend with hopes of recover
ing the stolen Stanford Axe,
which the committee believes is
being hidden here, The Daily
learned last night.
Mlrv Huff, president of the Cal
senior class and a member of the
committee, said there was a
strong possibility that a "con
voy'' of Axe committee members
will arrive "sometime in the af
ternoon" Friday.
He said the committee is meet
ing later this week to map out
further plans.
Hull' commented that he was
"pretty-sure" Stanford students
had taken the Axe, which was
reported stolen from the UC
Berkeley campus last June.
He said he believed the Stan
ford baseball team has the Axe
in its possession although that
story was revealed as a hoax last
week by Ralph Vetterlein, presi
dent of the Associated Students
of University of California.
Vetterlein said that Cal stu
dents themselves started the ru
mor that the Axe had been taken
to the Nationals in Omaha by
the Farm baseball team. Vetter
lein emphasized the rumor was
started as a gag.
Meanwhile there were indi
cations that the whole mys
tery of the disappearance of
the old blade was being cooked
up as a publicity stunt to high
light the forthcoming annual
Big Game.

Huff said last night that the
Axe - finding committee had a
number of leads on the Axe, but
declined to disclose them "right
now."
However, he told The Daily
that Stanford definitely was in
cluded among the leads.
He said the Axe-finding com
mittee was anxious to re-create
the old-time "rivalry spirit" be
tween Stanford and Cal and that
the Axe would help develop that
spirit since it is the traditional
symbol of rivalry between Stan
ford and Cal.
The senior class president said
that plans were in the offing at
UC for several publicity stunts
involving the Axe.
Huff corrected a previous
statement issued by Cal that
the Axe-finding committee is
composed of 150 members. Ac
tually, he said, there are about
1(> members representing the
freshmad. sophomore, junior,
and senior classes at UC.
Huff reported the committee
was "quite a spirited group" and
that it has met five times since
it was appointed last Wednesday
to draw plans for recovering the
old blade.
The only clue so far in the
theft of the Axe, according to
HulT, has been a $5 bill which
was left near the showcase in
which the Axe was displayed
in Stephens Union at UC.
"That was hardly enough to
pay for the damages," Huff said.
He estimated cost of the damage
to be about $25.
Huff declared that the Axe it
self was removed but the plaque
on which it was mounted was
left intact.
