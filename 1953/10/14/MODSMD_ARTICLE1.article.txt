## EAR EASTERN POLICY Oxford, Stanford Debate U.S. Policy; No Decision in Tuesday Series Feature 
### BILL WRIGHT 
The wisdom of American for
eign policy in the Far East took;
a verbal beating last night from
two Oxford University debaters
in the Tuesday Evening Series
before a large, appreciative au
dience in Memorial Hall.
R. Chandler Myers and David Ja- j
cobson of Stanford opposed the j
cleverly presented British position
on the question: "Resolved, that this
house regrets the Far Eastern pol
icy of the present American admin
istration."
Patrick Mayhew and John Peters,!
the Oxford pair who are launching j
a series of 50 debates in the United
States, particularly attacked the ad- i
ministration's stand on Red China j
and the Korean peace settlement.
Mayhew strongly advocated that ;
(lie United States recognize the
Mao T.se-tung regime, saying, I

"We have got to make some con- |
cessions because the Chinese and
Russians are in too strong a posi
tion to make concessions lo us ,|
without return."
He likened the Communists in
China to the transitory governments I
in South America which the United
States makes a practice of recogniz- j
ing as soon as those governments
are in effective power. "This would
not be appeasement," he declared. }
"We would demand concessions in
return."
The British felt that we would not :
have too much to lose by admitting
the Reds to the United Nations be- i

cause "One Communist veto is just
as powerful as two."
Peters contested, "The chair oc
cupied by Nationalist China is just
too big a seat at the moment for
the people who are in it."
Hut Jacobson countered with
the opinion that we had nothing
at all to Kain and that we would
he in grave danger of losing For
mosa. a major sector in the Amer
ican line of defense in the Pacific,
if we forego the cause of the Na
tionalists.
Myers claimed that it would be a
contradiction to give diplomatic
blessing to the Chinese Communists
while we are still technically fight
ing them as aggressors in Korea.
The British criticized the cold
shoulder the United States has
turned to India, one of the major
powers in Asia, in regard to our
stand on the Korean peace settle
ment.
Responding that the United
States was only trying to carry
out terms of the agreement signed
with the Red officers, the Stan
ford students upheld the Ameri
can demand that only those who
had enough interest to fight in
Korea should be at the peace con
ference.
Professor Claude A. Buss of the
Stanford History Department pre
sided at the debate.
