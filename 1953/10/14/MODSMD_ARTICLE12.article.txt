# Work Starts On New Lab
## 
### 
A new Geophysics Laboratory for
the Stanford School of Mineral Sci
ences is under construction, it was
announced yesterday by President
Wallace Sterling.
The $55,000 structure is being
built nearby and west of the Elec
tronics Research Laboratory. It is
the fourth building in the area
which is to become the Science
Quadrangle of Stanford.
Applied Mathematics and Re
search, Electronics Research, and
the W. W. Hansen Laboratories
were the first buildings located on
the Science Quad site.
Architecture of the new labora
tory will be similarly styled in a
single - s'ory, reinforced concrete
block construction. It will be fin
ished in a sandstone color to har
monize with other campus struc
tures.
