WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 (UP) —Defense Secretary Charles E. |
Wilson said today espionage may have been uncovered at the I
Army's P'ort Monmouth, N.J., radar laboratories.
At the same time, a Senate subcommittee in New York heard
testimony that a "sizeable number" of Army documents, believed

to concern radar, have been mis-"*
sing for two years. Committee
Chairman Sen. Joseph McCarthy
said the documents could be "t\x
tremely dangerous" to national se
■curity it they fell into enemy hands. '
Wilson told a news conference
here that the facts about Fort Mon
mouth will not be known until the
Army completes its investigation.
His announcement was the first
word that his department, as well
as McCarthy's subcommittee, was
investigating Fort Monmouth.
Wilson was asked whether es
pionage or security was involved.
'"It looks like it might be more
than a security leak," he replied.
Army Secretary Robert T. Ste
vens sat in on the hearings of Mc-
Carthy's committee today and said
afterward he was "intensely inter
ested" in testimony that a staff
member of the Army radar labora
tory was a close associate of exe
cuted atomic spy Julius Rosenberg.
After the closed hearing, McCar
thy said the Army had been hunt
ing for two years for the missing
documents and said one witness
said they concerned radar.
McCarthy said the Army claimed
it had certificates of destruction for
ail the documents but recent inves
tigation indicated that a "sizeable
number" of certificates were miss
ing. He said Stevens had agreed to
bring an Army officer back from
Europe and to help locate another
officer for questioning about the
missing documents.
McCarthy said he would recall the
radar worker tomorrow.
