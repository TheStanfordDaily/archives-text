WASHINGTON. Oct. 13 (UP) â€”
Defense Secretary Charles E. Wil
son today stood solidly behind his
estimate that it will be perhaps
three years before Russia is able to
launch an effective H-bomb at
tack on the United States.
Wilson was asked at the news
conference if he wanted to change
his statement last week on the Rus
sian H-bomb threat. It appeared to
be in conflict with numerous other
statements by high officials and
contributed to President Eisenhow
er's decision to order all officials to
clear such statements with the
Atomic Energy Commission.
