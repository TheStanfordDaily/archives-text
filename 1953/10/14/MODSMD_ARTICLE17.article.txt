# Flick Sneaks To Be Stopped
## 
### 
Extra student police will be hired
! to guard the entrance ways into
Memorial Auditorium during the
j showing of Sunday Evening Movies
j to stop an increasing number of
| persons from sneaking in, it was an
nounced yesterday.
It was estimated by Mike Zeiler,
| manager of the Sunday Hicks, that
upwards to 100 persons have ille
gally entered the large auditorium
' during each of the two Sunday
i shows held this quarter. â€¢
In the past, he said, the number
of persons sneaking in never topped
15.
Those found entering without
having paid the required 20 cents
admission price will be turned over
to Mens' or Women's Council, Zei
ler said.
Reason for the action, according
to Zeiler, is that the sneak-ins have
led to overcrowding, forcing many '
j movie-goers to stand in the aisles !
j in violation of fire regulations.

situation see his letter, published
