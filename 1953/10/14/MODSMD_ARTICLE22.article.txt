Independent Sen. Wayne Morse aid
today he will give the voter., a
chance to review their "great mis
take" of 1952 before he votes to up
set Republican control of the Sen
ate.
If the GOP fails to increase ifri
Senate membership in the 1954 elec
tions, Morse said he will then vol/:
with the Democrats to organize the
Senate. But he said it would be "un -
ethical" for him to do so before the
voters render their verdict.

question mark In Senate procedui'-
Monday when Democratic Mayor
Thomas A. Burke of Cleveland w--i i
appointed to the Senate vacancy'
created by the death of the late Ohio
Sen. Robert A. Taft. (That gav< a
Senate line-up of 48 Democrats, M
Republicans, and Morse.)
Morse, who bolted the Republic-'!'
party during the 1952 presidential
race, said the GOP leaders need have
no fear that he will vote to turn
them out in the forthcoming second
session of the 83rd Congress.
