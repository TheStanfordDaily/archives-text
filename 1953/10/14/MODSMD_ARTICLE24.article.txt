# Trieste, A Fuse to the Keg?
## 
### 
Unexpectedly, the world is trembling anew
with another convulsion of near war, this time
from the traditional powder-keg of the modern
world, the Balkans.
Again grim legions are either on the march
or ready to march in that mountainous region.
And -—as in 1914 and 1939 — the world
watches the area, apprehensively.
The present day possible Sarajevo is a sea
port city, Trieste, which has been under inter
national control since the end of World War If.
The immediate contestants are Yugoslavia
and Italy.
Possible combatants, all nations.
Italy and Yugoslavia, both prideful na
tions, desirous of elevating their position
among the rank of world powers, appear to
be at uncompromising sv/ords point, par
ticularly now that Marshall Tito is deter
minedly pressing his ultimatum:
That if Italy marches into the to-be-evacu
ated Zone A of Trieste so will the troops of
Yugoslavia.
The consequences of such a move seem
frighteningly apparent.
It seems sharply clear that Tito is not bluff
ing, for unhesitatingly he has ordered extra
troops into Yugoslav territory bordering the
contested zone.
Already an enflamed Yugoslav mob has
stoned an American information official in
Yugoslavia.
And already, the always politically astute
Russians have attempted to "cash in" on the
controversy by accusing American and British
officials of committing "a grave violation" of
the Italian peace treaty by turning Zone A over
to the Italians.
The elements of a world wide up-set are in
evidence, and America, Britain, and Russia
are already tied elementally into the problem.

The ugly Trieste situation, which has been
in and out of the newspapers since the end
of the war but never quite so conspicuously,
flared to its present irritating proportions with
the announcement last week that Britain and
America intend to pull out of Zone A—which
they have occupied since the end of World
War ll—and turn control over to Italians.
Tito immediately protested. On Monday of
this week he asked for a Four Power conference
on the issue. (By four power, he meant the
United States, Britain, Yugoslavia, and Italy.)
As yet there has been no official American
reply to the request, but an emergency meeting
of the foreign ministers of the Big Three, pre
sumably the U. S., Britain, and Russia, has been
called to discuss the Trieste affair and other
international problems in London on Friday.
We hope that the foreign ministers meeting
will be productive and will open the way to
a solution of the Trieste crisis.
Obviously, a war—even a mild border clash
—must be prevented.
Tempers are too touchy these days to permit
the slightest unnecessary provocation.
When our delegates approach the confer
ence table, we hope they will do so with high
minded determination not to bow to the in
timidation of the Russians or of Tito's tough
talk.
We hope they will act firmly and intelligently
and squash immediately the vicious propa
ganda wedge the Russians are trying to insert
in the United Nations by demanding Security
Council consideration of the problem.
What course the Eisenhower administration
will take for the solution of this crisis has not
as yet been made known.
But what ever it is, we hope that it measures
to the full stature of the United States as leader
of the free world.

What course the Eisenhower administration
will take for the solution of this crisis has not
as yet been made known.
But what ever it is, we hope that it measures
to the full stature of the United States as leader
of the free world.
Unexpectedly, the world is trembling anew
with another convulsion of near war, this time
from the traditional powder-keg of the modern
world, the Balkans.
Again grim legions are either on the march
or ready to march in that mountainous region.
And -—as in 1914 and 1939 — the world
watches the area, apprehensively.
The present day possible Sarajevo is a sea
port city, Trieste, which has been under inter
national control since the end of World War If.
The immediate contestants are Yugoslavia
and Italy.
Possible combatants, all nations.
Italy and Yugoslavia, both prideful na
tions, desirous of elevating their position
among the rank of world powers, appear to
be at uncompromising sv/ords point, par
ticularly now that Marshall Tito is deter
minedly pressing his ultimatum:
That if Italy marches into the to-be-evacu
ated Zone A of Trieste so will the troops of
Yugoslavia.
The consequences of such a move seem
frighteningly apparent.
It seems sharply clear that Tito is not bluff
ing, for unhesitatingly he has ordered extra
troops into Yugoslav territory bordering the
contested zone.
Already an enflamed Yugoslav mob has
stoned an American information official in
Yugoslavia.
And already, the always politically astute
Russians have attempted to "cash in" on the
controversy by accusing American and British
officials of committing "a grave violation" of
the Italian peace treaty by turning Zone A over
to the Italians.
The elements of a world wide up-set are in
evidence, and America, Britain, and Russia
are already tied elementally into the problem.

The ugly Trieste situation, which has been
in and out of the newspapers since the end
of the war but never quite so conspicuously,
flared to its present irritating proportions with
the announcement last week that Britain and
America intend to pull out of Zone A—which
they have occupied since the end of World
War ll—and turn control over to Italians.
Tito immediately protested. On Monday of
this week he asked for a Four Power conference
on the issue. (By four power, he meant the
United States, Britain, Yugoslavia, and Italy.)
As yet there has been no official American
reply to the request, but an emergency meeting
of the foreign ministers of the Big Three, pre
sumably the U. S., Britain, and Russia, has been
called to discuss the Trieste affair and other
international problems in London on Friday.
We hope that the foreign ministers meeting
will be productive and will open the way to
a solution of the Trieste crisis.
Obviously, a war—even a mild border clash
—must be prevented.
Tempers are too touchy these days to permit
the slightest unnecessary provocation.
When our delegates approach the confer
ence table, we hope they will do so with high
minded determination not to bow to the in
timidation of the Russians or of Tito's tough
talk.
We hope they will act firmly and intelligently
and squash immediately the vicious propa
ganda wedge the Russians are trying to insert
in the United Nations by demanding Security
Council consideration of the problem.
