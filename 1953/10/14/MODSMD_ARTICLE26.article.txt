# CAMPUS OPINION
## Sneak-ins at the Flicks 
### 
To the* Editor:
Evont;? which have happened at the last two Sun
day Evening Movies have made it necessary for nie
to tail the attention of the student body to certain
facts:
1 Memorial Auditorium is capable of holding 1,719
people. The .student police stop selling tickets when
they reach 1,(598, because they expect between ten and
fifteen people to sneak in every week. Since, for the
last two Sundays, the crowd has overflowed into the
aisles, it has become obvious that we can no longer
pass over the situation lightly. Every person who pur
chases a ticket is entitled to and must occupy a seat,
or else we are violating the fire laws. For this reason,
extra cops will be put on duty for the sole purpose of
watching for people sneaking in, and those who are
caught will have their names turned in to Men's or
Women's Council. Here is a hint to those who find
that the fits—think if twenty cents is too high a
price to pay in order to avoid coming up on a funda
mental Standard violation.
2 The time has come officially to let those who at
tend know the policy of Sunday Evening Movies.
It is no longei intended to be a place for students to

let off steam. That purpose ended when we stopped
showing serials. There was a good reason for this,
it was not just an arbitrary decision on the part of
a movie manager. We were on the verge of not being
allowed to use the auditorium because of the con
dition that it was being left in. There has been an
attempt to show better pictures—this has led to an
increasing crowd of people who come to enjoy the
film. For this reason, anybody who brings a noise
maker and is spotted will not be admitted. If at any
time the crowd gets as far out of hand as it did last
Sunday, the picture will be stopped and a slide in
dicating the reason for the halt will be put on the
screen, then the film will be started again, and if
there is no improvement in the situation, the auditori
um will be cleared and no money will be refunded.
It is unfortunate that circumstances have made an
announcement like this necessary. But, for the sake
of those who find the flicks a cheap, enjoyable way to
spend a Sunday evening, it had to be done. It will be
effective if it will just make the thoughtless ones
aware of the fact that they may be Contributing to
the end of the flicks.

let off steam. That purpose ended when we stopped
showing serials. There was a good reason for this,
it was not just an arbitrary decision on the part of
a movie manager. We were on the verge of not being
allowed to use the auditorium because of the con
dition that it was being left in. There has been an
attempt to show better pictures—this has led to an
increasing crowd of people who come to enjoy the
film. For this reason, anybody who brings a noise
maker and is spotted will not be admitted. If at any
time the crowd gets as far out of hand as it did last
Sunday, the picture will be stopped and a slide in
dicating the reason for the halt will be put on the
screen, then the film will be started again, and if
there is no improvement in the situation, the auditori
um will be cleared and no money will be refunded.
It is unfortunate that circumstances have made an
announcement like this necessary. But, for the sake
of those who find the flicks a cheap, enjoyable way to
spend a Sunday evening, it had to be done. It will be
effective if it will just make the thoughtless ones
aware of the fact that they may be Contributing to
the end of the flicks.

To the* Editor:
Evont;? which have happened at the last two Sun
day Evening Movies have made it necessary for nie
to tail the attention of the student body to certain
facts:
1 Memorial Auditorium is capable of holding 1,719
people. The .student police stop selling tickets when
they reach 1,(598, because they expect between ten and
fifteen people to sneak in every week. Since, for the
last two Sundays, the crowd has overflowed into the
aisles, it has become obvious that we can no longer
pass over the situation lightly. Every person who pur
chases a ticket is entitled to and must occupy a seat,
or else we are violating the fire laws. For this reason,
extra cops will be put on duty for the sole purpose of
watching for people sneaking in, and those who are
caught will have their names turned in to Men's or
Women's Council. Here is a hint to those who find
that the fits—think if twenty cents is too high a
price to pay in order to avoid coming up on a funda
mental Standard violation.
2 The time has come officially to let those who at
tend know the policy of Sunday Evening Movies.
It is no longei intended to be a place for students to

let off steam. That purpose ended when we stopped
