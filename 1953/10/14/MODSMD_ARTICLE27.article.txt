Thr com ?rns a parking situation on campus.
The other ti. v 1 parked my car behind the main
ibrary and returned to find a little red ticket: "out
if lint The lines are made of lime, and my car
m.i parked at the end of one, the first in line. Frankly,
nost of the lines get pretty fuzzed, and at their ends
.vhere cut; have mauled them over they aren't there
;it all' It seem 1 ; to me "no lime, no crime."

This is written after seeing three other "end of the
line" parkers get the same ticket. While I see the
inconvenience this puts others in, I can also see how
easy it was for them to miss the line, but it's not so
easy to miss that $2.
How about some permanent lines—a little cement
poured in a ditch perhaps? What can lie done? I
leave it with you.
