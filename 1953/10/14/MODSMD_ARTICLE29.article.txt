(Editor's note: This is the third in a series of articles dealing with
top student organizations.)

The Executive Committee of the Associated Students of Stanford
Universityâ€”that's the formal name for Excom, the student-elected
group which formulates policy and makes the rules for all or
ganized student extra-curricular activities.
Excom, which is given in the ASSU constitution "the legislative
and executive power of this As- +

sociation," is specifically charged
with supervision of student body
finances, organizations, elections, and
athletic awards.
The 16 members of Excom who
meet in the ASSU room in the Stu
dent Union building are, in fact,
given a general control over every
thing pertaining to student affairs,
since in controlling ASSU they by
definition control the student body.
An example is the current drive
by Excom to correct traffic condi
tions on and around the Stanford
campus, in the interest of protect
ing students from serious acci
dents such as the recent Alpine
Road collision which took the life
of Alec Gerbode and seriously in
jured Don Hanson.
Another important recent move
was the approval of a constitution
for the new Stanford Political Un
ion, which went through Excom a
week ago.
Student organizations controlled
by Excom include the publications:
Quad, Chaparral, Dividcx, and The
Daily; also lIR. AWS, and WAA. In
conjunction with the faculty, it de
termines policy for the Athletic
Board and the Stanford Bookstore.
Excom standing committees
control drives. Honor Code, Fun
damental Standard, and athletic
events. Clubs, living groups,
classes, and honorary societies all
come under Excom's jurisdiction.
The only campus organization
which does not come under Ex
com is KZSU, the campus radio
station, which is affiliated with
the Speech and Drama Depart
ment.
Members of Excom are defined in
the ASSU constitution. The student
body positions which are repre
sented on Excom from year to year,
and this year's members, follow:
Don Lozabnick and Jeannie Bobis
are chairman and vice-chairman of

Excom respectively, by virtue of
their student body positions as pres
ident and vice-president of the As
sociated Students. The classes are
represented by Dick Miller, sopho
mores; Guy Shoup, juniors; Mel
Bethke, seniors; and Jim Mitchell
and Glen Smith, graduates. A rep
resentative for the freshmen will be
selected later, increasing the size of
Excom to 17.
Women's residence representa
tives are Nancy Nicholson, Wom
en's Row; Jackie Begien, Union
Units; Barbara Myer, Women's
Halls. Representing the men are
David Carr, fraternities; Bob Mi
shell. Men's Halls.
Village residents are represented
by Ai Ivey, and Alice Jo Kwong
represents off-campus students.
Ex-oflicio, non-voting members of
Excom are the student manager,
this year John Stahr, and the edi
tor of The Daily, Hadley Roff.
Meetings of Excom, on Wednes
day night at 7:30, are open to all
students.
