# PUNTS AND PITCHES
## Spirit May Beat the Bruins 
### PETE GROTHE 
We walked out of football practice Monday night abundantly enthused.
It was the sharpest, most spirited workout we had seen in two years.
Backlield Coach George Lynn concurred, "It was the best workout of the
year."
Before Monday, we wouldn't have bet a Western Civ syllabus on Stan
lord's chances. But that snlendid workout did somethintr to us. It wasn't

only that a newcomer named Joe Moreau was looking
devastating as a fullback and linebacker. Or that
Bob Garrett was completing passes all over the field,
including an 80-yard pass play to Sam Morley. Or
that the backs seemed to be hitting the line harder
than ever, especially Bill Rogers, A 1 Napoleon, and
Jarvis the Watson (the latter got off a 44-yard run).
Or that Win Wedge and Norm Manoogian were rocks
on defense. Or that the first string was stopping UCLA
plays cold. Or even that the hour scrimmage was run
off without an injury of consequence.
It was: more the spirit of the affair. The Stanford

Spirit, if you will. Even the most cynical sideline observers, who don't
recognize spirit as a factor, admitted that there was something special
about that afternoon session. It made them think that maybe Stanford
has a good chance after all to beat the baby-blue Bruins from UCLA.
Ami so. what about the Uclans? Stanford, unbeaten and unscored upon
in league play, but knocked around in non-conference tiffs, meets UCLA,
also unbeaten and unscored upon in league play—but, unlike Stanford,
unblemished in other outings. UCLA is rated the top squad in the PCC,
and so a Card triumph would automatically make the Indians the team to
beat.
What will it take to beat the kids with powder-puff blue jerseys? Listen
to Stanford's great line coach, Joe Ruetz, who scouted the Westwboders:
"To take UCLA, we'll have to play better than we have in any of our four
previous games, even better than the first half against Illinois."
Bruin mentor Red Sanders, an excellent coach who has the personality
of a dead fish, claims that this year's squad is even better than last year's.
The 1952 aggregation, you may ren\ember, came within two points of a
perfect season. This season's outfit has rolled up 85 points to the opposi
tion's 7. Further, the Uclan running attack is stronger this season, with
the Coast's best back, Paul Cameron, spearheading a flock of strong backs.
Also, there is not a single weakness that Stanford can pick on. UCLA
is not a team of supermen, but its strength is that there isn't a really poor
blocker or weak defensive player on the team.
However, the Bruins don't have as an effective pass attack this season.
Cameron throws a hard ball to hang onto and with glue-fingered ends Ike
Jones and Ernie Stockert graduated, the emphasis is more on running this
year.
Against the Bruins, whose prestige is undeniably formidable, the Indians
have a few weapons of their own. They have the end combination of John
' Steinberg and Sambo Morley, who according to the latest PCC statistics,
rate one-two in conference pass reception. They have Bob Garrett, whom
OSC Coach Kip Taylor described as a better thrower than either Cameron
or Cal's Paul Larson. They have Ron Cook, the third leading runner in the
conference with 245 yards gained for a 6.8 average. They have the best j
guard on the Coast, Norm Manoogian, anchoring a line that is defensively j
solid from tackle to tackle.
But if the Indians intend to win this Saturday. there!s one weapon that
can do it—the forward pass. Garrett's accuracy has been near-perfect j
this season, and with receivers like Steinberg, Morley, Cook, and Dorn
around, the Cards could shock the experts.
This prediction may be as rare as a speech and drama major in an en- j
gineering course, but we're picking Chuck Taylor's crew to win. Like we
say, that Monday practice did something to us.
As the police inspector in the Class B movie says as he's about to raid
the killer's hideout, "Men, this is it."

It was the sharpest, most spirited workout we had seen in two years.
Backlield Coach George Lynn concurred, "It was the best workout of the
year."
Before Monday, we wouldn't have bet a Western Civ syllabus on Stan
lord's chances. But that snlendid workout did somethintr to us. It wasn't

only that a newcomer named Joe Moreau was looking
devastating as a fullback and linebacker. Or that
Bob Garrett was completing passes all over the field,
including an 80-yard pass play to Sam Morley. Or
that the backs seemed to be hitting the line harder
than ever, especially Bill Rogers, A 1 Napoleon, and
Jarvis the Watson (the latter got off a 44-yard run).
Or that Win Wedge and Norm Manoogian were rocks
on defense. Or that the first string was stopping UCLA
plays cold. Or even that the hour scrimmage was run
off without an injury of consequence.
It was: more the spirit of the affair. The Stanford

Spirit, if you will. Even the most cynical sideline observers, who don't
recognize spirit as a factor, admitted that there was something special
about that afternoon session. It made them think that maybe Stanford
has a good chance after all to beat the baby-blue Bruins from UCLA.
Ami so. what about the Uclans? Stanford, unbeaten and unscored upon
in league play, but knocked around in non-conference tiffs, meets UCLA,
also unbeaten and unscored upon in league play—but, unlike Stanford,
unblemished in other outings. UCLA is rated the top squad in the PCC,
and so a Card triumph would automatically make the Indians the team to
beat.
What will it take to beat the kids with powder-puff blue jerseys? Listen
to Stanford's great line coach, Joe Ruetz, who scouted the Westwboders:
"To take UCLA, we'll have to play better than we have in any of our four
previous games, even better than the first half against Illinois."
Bruin mentor Red Sanders, an excellent coach who has the personality
of a dead fish, claims that this year's squad is even better than last year's.
The 1952 aggregation, you may ren\ember, came within two points of a
perfect season. This season's outfit has rolled up 85 points to the opposi
tion's 7. Further, the Uclan running attack is stronger this season, with
the Coast's best back, Paul Cameron, spearheading a flock of strong backs.
Also, there is not a single weakness that Stanford can pick on. UCLA
is not a team of supermen, but its strength is that there isn't a really poor
blocker or weak defensive player on the team.
However, the Bruins don't have as an effective pass attack this season.
Cameron throws a hard ball to hang onto and with glue-fingered ends Ike
Jones and Ernie Stockert graduated, the emphasis is more on running this
year.
Against the Bruins, whose prestige is undeniably formidable, the Indians
have a few weapons of their own. They have the end combination of John
' Steinberg and Sambo Morley, who according to the latest PCC statistics,
rate one-two in conference pass reception. They have Bob Garrett, whom
OSC Coach Kip Taylor described as a better thrower than either Cameron
or Cal's Paul Larson. They have Ron Cook, the third leading runner in the
conference with 245 yards gained for a 6.8 average. They have the best j
guard on the Coast, Norm Manoogian, anchoring a line that is defensively j
solid from tackle to tackle.
But if the Indians intend to win this Saturday. there!s one weapon that
can do it—the forward pass. Garrett's accuracy has been near-perfect j
this season, and with receivers like Steinberg, Morley, Cook, and Dorn
around, the Cards could shock the experts.
This prediction may be as rare as a speech and drama major in an en- j
gineering course, but we're picking Chuck Taylor's crew to win. Like we
say, that Monday practice did something to us.

It was the sharpest, most spirited workout we had seen in two years.
Backlield Coach George Lynn concurred, "It was the best workout of the
year."
Before Monday, we wouldn't have bet a Western Civ syllabus on Stan
lord's chances. But that snlendid workout did somethintr to us. It wasn't

only that a newcomer named Joe Moreau was looking
devastating as a fullback and linebacker. Or that
Bob Garrett was completing passes all over the field,
including an 80-yard pass play to Sam Morley. Or
that the backs seemed to be hitting the line harder
than ever, especially Bill Rogers, A 1 Napoleon, and
Jarvis the Watson (the latter got off a 44-yard run).
Or that Win Wedge and Norm Manoogian were rocks
on defense. Or that the first string was stopping UCLA
plays cold. Or even that the hour scrimmage was run
off without an injury of consequence.
It was: more the spirit of the affair. The Stanford

Spirit, if you will. Even the most cynical sideline observers, who don't
recognize spirit as a factor, admitted that there was something special
about that afternoon session. It made them think that maybe Stanford
has a good chance after all to beat the baby-blue Bruins from UCLA.
Ami so. what about the Uclans? Stanford, unbeaten and unscored upon
in league play, but knocked around in non-conference tiffs, meets UCLA,
also unbeaten and unscored upon in league play—but, unlike Stanford,
unblemished in other outings. UCLA is rated the top squad in the PCC,
and so a Card triumph would automatically make the Indians the team to
beat.
What will it take to beat the kids with powder-puff blue jerseys? Listen
to Stanford's great line coach, Joe Ruetz, who scouted the Westwboders:
"To take UCLA, we'll have to play better than we have in any of our four
previous games, even better than the first half against Illinois."
Bruin mentor Red Sanders, an excellent coach who has the personality
of a dead fish, claims that this year's squad is even better than last year's.
The 1952 aggregation, you may ren\ember, came within two points of a
perfect season. This season's outfit has rolled up 85 points to the opposi
tion's 7. Further, the Uclan running attack is stronger this season, with
the Coast's best back, Paul Cameron, spearheading a flock of strong backs.
Also, there is not a single weakness that Stanford can pick on. UCLA
is not a team of supermen, but its strength is that there isn't a really poor
blocker or weak defensive player on the team.
However, the Bruins don't have as an effective pass attack this season.
Cameron throws a hard ball to hang onto and with glue-fingered ends Ike
Jones and Ernie Stockert graduated, the emphasis is more on running this
year.
Against the Bruins, whose prestige is undeniably formidable, the Indians
have a few weapons of their own. They have the end combination of John
' Steinberg and Sambo Morley, who according to the latest PCC statistics,
rate one-two in conference pass reception. They have Bob Garrett, whom
OSC Coach Kip Taylor described as a better thrower than either Cameron
or Cal's Paul Larson. They have Ron Cook, the third leading runner in the
conference with 245 yards gained for a 6.8 average. They have the best j
guard on the Coast, Norm Manoogian, anchoring a line that is defensively j
solid from tackle to tackle.
But if the Indians intend to win this Saturday. there!s one weapon that
can do it—the forward pass. Garrett's accuracy has been near-perfect j
this season, and with receivers like Steinberg, Morley, Cook, and Dorn
around, the Cards could shock the experts.
This prediction may be as rare as a speech and drama major in an en- j
gineering course, but we're picking Chuck Taylor's crew to win. Like we
say, that Monday practice did something to us.
As the police inspector in the Class B movie says as he's about to raid
the killer's hideout, "Men, this is it."
