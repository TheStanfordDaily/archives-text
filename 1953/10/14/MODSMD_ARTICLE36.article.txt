## Card Gridders Stage Light Pass Workout 
### 
The Stanford football team went
through a light but intensive pass
offense and pass defense workout
yesterday, as the Indians continued
their "Beat UCLA - ' campaign.
Coach Chuck Taylor spent a good
portion of the practice defensing

against aerials from the single wing,
the formation used by UCLA.
In the offensive drills, Taylor had
sophomore Don Kafka doing most
of the throwing, and he was on
target a majority of the time, with
John Steinberg, Sam Morley, and
John Stewart gathering in the
passes.
