# Biz School II Wins, 8-0
## 
### STEVE HILL 
Accepting a gift safety in the
first half and racking up a touch
down of their own in the last, the
Biz School II intramural football
squad outpassed Theta Chi II, 8-0,
yesterday.
After most of the opening half
was spent around midfield, Biz
School rolled to its opponents' one
yard line, where Theta Chi tpok
over on downs. Three passes fell in
complete, and on the fourth the pass
from center sailed over fullback
Paul Norgard and out of the end
zone, giving Biz School II a 2-0 lead
and all the points it needed to win.
The eventual winners added to
that margin early in the second half,
with tailback Jack Smith shoveling
a toss to center Frankie Flora from
one yard out, to count the game's
only TD. The extra point attempt,
a pass, was no good.
With four minutes to go Fred Mo
ney, right end for Biz School, in
tercepted a pass, and his teammates
used up three minutes running off
as many plays. However, on fourth
down, Norgard raced in to block a
punt, which Theta Chi II recovered
just short of the goal. But time ran
out before they could punch it over.
