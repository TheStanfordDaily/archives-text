# EXCOM AGENDA
## New NSA Debate Set For Tonight 
### 
Excom will renew its discussion
tonight on a possible membership
for Stanford in the National Stu
dents Association, an organization of
the student bodies of American uni
versities.
The regular Wednesday meeting of
the committee has been switched
from the Excom Room in the Union
to Roble in an attempt to acquaint
freshman women with the work of
the ASSU legislative group.
Three students will offer indi
vidual reports on their studies of
NSA and the advisability of Stan
ford's membership.
Chairman Don Lozabnick and Al
ice Kwong, a member of last year's
Excom, will report on the NSA na
tional convention they attended dur
ing the summer. Both made studies
of the association as unofficial rep
resentatives of Stanford.
Steve Voykovick, presently a
graduate student at Stanford, will
extend the discussion with additional
details on the work and organization
of NSA. Voykovick, a past student
Isody president at Fordham Univer
sity, was national vice-president of
NSA last year.
The members of last year's Excom
voted to table discussion on NSA be
cause of insufficient information on
the subject.
Lozabnick said last night that
Excom might take official action on
proposed membership for Stanford,
but that he would make no specific
recommendation to committee
members.
"I want to find out if we have the
money to pay for such a membership
and if the Executive Committee
thinks it would be worth it," he
said.
The group will also consider ap
proval of the proposed constitution
of the Graduate Students Associa
tion. The constitution will have to
be accepted by Excom before the
Association is officially recognized
by ASSU.
