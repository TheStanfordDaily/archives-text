WASHINGTON. Oct. 13 (UP) â€”
The Defense Department ordered
Selective Service today to provide
23,000 new draftees for the Army
in December.
The Navy. Air Force, and Marine
Corps will continue to depend on
volunteers and re-enlistments at
least for the time being although
there have been reports they may
have to resort to the draft later.
The 23,000-man Army call was
the same as those issued since last
July. Inductions are scheduled to
continue at this rate until next
July. *
