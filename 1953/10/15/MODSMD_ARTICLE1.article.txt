## Brawls Rock Trieste; Dulles Flies to London 
### 
(Compiled from dispatches of the United Prese) â€”Street brawling broke out in Trieste last
night and American-made tanks of the Yugoslav army pounded toward the crisis-ridden free
territory between Italy and Yugoslavia.
Meantime, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles was enroute to London for urgent Big Three
talks with a pledge to seek the basis "for a lasting peace."
Dulles, who conferred with President Eisenhower before his departure, will meet tomorrow
and Saturday with British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and French Foreign Minister Geor
ges Bidault to discuss violence-torn Trieste and other critical world problems.

The brawling in the port city j
began when 800 Italian demonstra
tors massed to break up a rally
called in defiance of Allied military j
orders by the pro-Yugoslav "Inde
pendenec Front."
"Italian youths chanting "Death to i
Tito" wrecked the offices of the j
Yugoslav commercial mission.
Scores of persons suffered bruises j
and minor wounds in the first vio
len'ce in Trieste since the Anglo-
American decision to turn Zone A .
of the territory over to Italy. Fly
ing squads of police arrested a num
ber in breaking up the disorders, j
Some hope for a peaceful solu- j
tion of the Trieste dispute was
offered in dispatches from Bel- j
tirade even before Dulles took oil"
from Washington National Airport
in a Military Air Transport Serv
ice plane.
An authoritative source told the
United Press in Belgrade that Rus
sia's proposal to lay the Trieste
problem before the United Nations
was unwelcome to Yugoslav leaders
and might result in a solution out
side the world organization.
This source said Marshal Tito
wants to co-operate with the West
and docs not want Russia in the
controversy.
Tito, in a speech last Sunday
denouncing the Anglo-American
decision, told cheering Yugoslavs
he would send his armed forces
into Zone A of the Trieste terri
tory "the moment" Italian troops
entered it.
The flarcup in Trieste and the
concrete evidence of Tito's backing
tor his announced intentions came
as the focal point of the crisis swung
away from Belgrade.
After nearly a week of violent
demonstrations there, relative peace
was reported, together with the be
lief in some quarters that the worst
was over.
