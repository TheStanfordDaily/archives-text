(Ed. note: tlie following history
of partisan politics on Stanford's
campus was compiled by ASSU
President Don Lozabnick for his I
"Welcoming Address" tonight.)
No partisan politics on cam-;
pus. An old Stanford tradition?
Not at all.
In fact, partisan politics at Stan
ford have had a long and checkered
career, on-again, off-again, ever
since the school was founded.
In the beginning, Leland Stanford,
an astute politician himself, stated
in his founding grant that the Uni
versity should "influence a love and
reverence for the great principles of
government."
The original Board of Trustees'
ruling that "the University shall
forever be kept out of politics and
that no professor shall seek to
dominate other professors or stu
dents for the success of any politi
cal party or candidate," was pass
ed in 189(>. eleven years after the
University's founding.
That ruling, Mrs. Stanford's idea,
was prompted by the campaign of
1896, in which Stanford found that
the public was associating the whole
school with the ideas of one of its
professors who was unusually active
in that campaign.
Ruling or no ruling, Stanford stu
dents never really stayed completely
out of national politics. In 1922
Stanford and Cal students ushered
tor the Democratic convention in
San Francisco, Stanford yell lead
ers organized demonstrations for the
| leading candidates ' for nomination,
| and the campus itself was the scene
| of political rallies.
Possibly because of all this
activity, the Trustees in 1924
strengthened their original ruling
by adding. "None of the assembly
bails, buildings, or grounds shall
be used for political or partisan
addresses or gatherings."
In 1933 that ruling was relaxed,
i and three political clubs, Rcpubli
| can, Democrat, and Socialist, be
l came very active for a short time.
The next political organization to
j appear on campus was the non
partisan Political Union of 1939.
The 1953 Union, has a funda
mental advantage over earlier
projects, because the Board of
Trustees voted a year and a half
ago to relax its restrictions against
partisan political speakers on cam
pus.
That's the history up until tonight.
From 8 p.m.. Oct. 15, 1953, on,

The original Board of Trustees'
ruling that "the University shall
forever be kept out of politics and
that no professor shall seek to
dominate other professors or stu
dents for the success of any politi
cal party or candidate," was pass
ed in 189(>. eleven years after the
University's founding.
That ruling, Mrs. Stanford's idea,
was prompted by the campaign of
1896, in which Stanford found that
the public was associating the whole
school with the ideas of one of its
professors who was unusually active
in that campaign.
Ruling or no ruling, Stanford stu
dents never really stayed completely
out of national politics. In 1922
Stanford and Cal students ushered
tor the Democratic convention in
San Francisco, Stanford yell lead
ers organized demonstrations for the
| leading candidates ' for nomination,
| and the campus itself was the scene
| of political rallies.
Possibly because of all this
activity, the Trustees in 1924
strengthened their original ruling
by adding. "None of the assembly
bails, buildings, or grounds shall
be used for political or partisan
addresses or gatherings."
In 1933 that ruling was relaxed,
i and three political clubs, Rcpubli
| can, Democrat, and Socialist, be
l came very active for a short time.
The next political organization to
j appear on campus was the non
partisan Political Union of 1939.
The 1953 Union, has a funda
mental advantage over earlier
projects, because the Board of
Trustees voted a year and a half
ago to relax its restrictions against
partisan political speakers on cam
pus.
That's the history up until tonight.

No partisan politics on cam-;
pus. An old Stanford tradition?
Not at all.
In fact, partisan politics at Stan
ford have had a long and checkered
career, on-again, off-again, ever
since the school was founded.
In the beginning, Leland Stanford,
an astute politician himself, stated
in his founding grant that the Uni
