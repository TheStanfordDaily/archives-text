# Out From Our Ivy
## 
### 
Tonight Stanford's new Political Union will
hold its first meeting.
Tonight for the first time in recent years
we'll be able to meet on campus to form an
organization devoted to political self educa
tion—on an adult and realistic basis.
Tonight we'll be able to form student po
litical parties right here on campus.
The Union is planned to give students who
would rather not join a partisan group every
chance to participate in its discussions and de
bate on an equal footing with party members.
But, beyond a doubt, much of its strength will
come from the organized enthusiasm and extra
activities of the new student parties.
Within the realistic framework of a partisan
system, we'll be able to study the basic ideol
ogy of the various national parties, and to de
cide whether or not, and to what degree, we
agree with these doctrines.
In our party caucusses and study-groups
we'll get some much-needed practice in deal
ing with vital issues, in precisely the same way
we'll have to be dealing with them in years to
come. ,
In debate on specific issues, we'll get still
more practical experience in the essence of

politics—finding the best possible solution to
a problem from the exchange of possibly con
flicting viewpoints.
Anyone with a Stanford education has heard
a hundred times, perhaps a thousand, that there
is usually more than one side to a question.
We've learned the need for an unbiased view
point in politics, the importance of an ability
to view political issues rationally and clearly,
not through a fog of party campaign oratory.
But we tend to forget that eventually every
one has to pick a side, form an opinion on an
issue, climb off that fence.
The Board of Trustees' 1952 ruling bans po
litical action on campus. For the time being
we'll have to go off-campus when we want to
campaign actively for our political viewpoints.
But tonight for the first time we'll be able to
start forming those viewpoints right here on
campus.
So tonight is the time when everyone on
campus should show up at Cubberley Audi
torium. Party member or independent, Re
publican or Democrat, we just can't be "not
interested" in politics. No ivy is thick enough
to protect an ostrich in today's world.
