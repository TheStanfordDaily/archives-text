# BULL SESSION
## A 						PRIVATE REPORTS 
### LARRY CAHN 
If an Army Induction notice does nothing else, it
at least clarifies an individual's position in the world
about him.
When I received mine Oct. 5, the deferments, the
anxiety, and the uncertainty were at an end. The
notice to report for'induction on Monday, Oct. 19,
meant one thing: my worries were over; the Army
would handle all the thinking there was to be done
for the next two years.
And it was a relief. For close to three years,
through my junior, senior, and graduate year,
there was always the inevitable draft, the doubt as
to whether [ would be allowed to finish school,
the Selective Service test and the increased pres
sure to obtain good grades.
When* I finished up this last August, there was the

feeling that uny job I might take
would be only temporary and any
hope of getting settled would only
£nd with the draft.
I went to my local board in San
Francisco and asked for a volun
tary induction. It's not enlisting,
but rather facing the inevitable
and telling the board that you
are ready to go as soon as pos-
Li ~ \r ..a. _ j. a _ ja i

sible. Your status doesn't change, you're still a draf
tee, and you still have two years to serve.
But the way I figured it was that the sooner I

went in the sooner I would he out, and with the
truce, it seems as good a time as any to face the
music.
Taking a voluntary induction necessitates the
signing of several papers waiving your right to
appeal. But once having made up your mind to
take a "voluntary," you have no reason to appeal
anyway.
The secretary at the board told me that it seems
that all the quotas these days were made up of men
wanting to volunteer and get their service time be
hind them. Therefore the calling of those who were
still in school or otherwise constructively occupied
was at a minimum.
The wait between signing the papers and receiv
ing your notice is not pleasant, but one morning that
long white envelope marked Selective Service is in
the mailbox, and inside are those familiar "greet
ings."
Enclosed with my notice is an information sheet
that tells you to bring only toilet articles, an extra
pair of glasses if you wear glasses, a pair of low-cut
brown shoes for off-duty hours, one change of under
wear and socks to carry you over until uniforms are
issued and little money. No cars are permitted during
basic training.
And it doesn't look like I am going to get much
free time; they warn against bringing athletic equip
ment or a surplus of civilian clothes to the training
station.

feeling that uny job I might take
would be only temporary and any
hope of getting settled would only
£nd with the draft.
I went to my local board in San
Francisco and asked for a volun
tary induction. It's not enlisting,
but rather facing the inevitable
and telling the board that you
are ready to go as soon as pos-
Li ~ \r ..a. _ j. a _ ja i

sible. Your status doesn't change, you're still a draf
tee, and you still have two years to serve.
But the way I figured it was that the sooner I

went in the sooner I would he out, and with the
truce, it seems as good a time as any to face the
music.
Taking a voluntary induction necessitates the
signing of several papers waiving your right to
appeal. But once having made up your mind to
take a "voluntary," you have no reason to appeal
anyway.
The secretary at the board told me that it seems
that all the quotas these days were made up of men
wanting to volunteer and get their service time be
hind them. Therefore the calling of those who were
still in school or otherwise constructively occupied
was at a minimum.
The wait between signing the papers and receiv
ing your notice is not pleasant, but one morning that
long white envelope marked Selective Service is in
the mailbox, and inside are those familiar "greet
ings."
Enclosed with my notice is an information sheet
that tells you to bring only toilet articles, an extra
pair of glasses if you wear glasses, a pair of low-cut
brown shoes for off-duty hours, one change of under
wear and socks to carry you over until uniforms are
issued and little money. No cars are permitted during
basic training.
And it doesn't look like I am going to get much
free time; they warn against bringing athletic equip
ment or a surplus of civilian clothes to the training
station.

If an Army Induction notice does nothing else, it
at least clarifies an individual's position in the world
about him.
When I received mine Oct. 5, the deferments, the
anxiety, and the uncertainty were at an end. The
notice to report for'induction on Monday, Oct. 19,
meant one thing: my worries were over; the Army
would handle all the thinking there was to be done
for the next two years.
And it was a relief. For close to three years,
through my junior, senior, and graduate year,
there was always the inevitable draft, the doubt as
to whether [ would be allowed to finish school,
the Selective Service test and the increased pres
sure to obtain good grades.
