## On the Political Union 
### 
To the Editor:
Tonight will mark the beginning of the Political
Union at Stanford University. Basically, .the Union
is organized as it is at Harvard and Yale and gives
to all students a chance to express their ideas on cur
rent issues, BUT will it work at Stanford?
Unfortunately, apathy has become the password
for most Stanford students. A political union cannot

be successful unless it becomes truly representative
of the student body. Much time, hard work, and
energy have gone into setting up the Stanford Po
litical Union, so why don't we give it some help by
attending this first meeting?
