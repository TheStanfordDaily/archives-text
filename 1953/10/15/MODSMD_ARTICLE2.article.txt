I'ANMUNJOM, Thursday, Oct. 15
— Anti-Red Chinese prisoners de
layed the start of Communist ex
plaining sessions today as they
hurled defiance at their Indian
guards and jeered Lt. Gen. K. S.
Thimayya when he rejected their
demands.
Thirty-five Chinese, representing
the 1,000 scheduled for talks with
the Reds, demanded that Thimayya
grant assurances they would not be
forced back to Communism.
When Thimayya, chairman of the
Neutral Nations Repatriation Com
mission, rejected the demands, 'the
prisoners refused to leave the en
closures.
As the Indian general conferred
with the POW's, other Chinese and
North Korean captives chanted and
sang songs while the Indian guards
remained outside the enclosures
armed with rifles and clubs.
The guards were scheduled to en
ter the compounds at 8 a.m., but two
hours later they were still outside
and did not march in the face of
possible violence.
