# Cardinals: Driving Force Behind Campus Activities
## 
### SALLY YATES 
(Editor's note: This is the final article in a series dealing with lead
ing student organizations.)

A beehive of activity, especially during fall quarter, is an Bxlo
- cubicle located on the top floor of the Stanford Union. Here
are housed the offices of Cardinals and its right-hand organization,
Rally Com.
Cardinals is the student organization which acts as an operating

nucleus for any activity which in-'*
volves all members of the ASSU.
Every member of Cardinals heads
one or more all - campus projects
during the year and is responsible
to the other Cardinals and to Ex
com for the entire handling of the
event.
Chairman of Cardinals this year
is junior Fred Aurel. Ruth De
lanis is secretary. The organiza
tion also includes two women and
three men from both the junior
and senior classes.
Ex - officio members are ASSU
President Don Lozabnick, ASSU
Vice - President Jeanie Bobis, Stu
dent Manager John Stahr, Daily
Managing Editor Sue Wheat, and
Liz Lavadary.
During the football season, the
functions of Rally Com are appar
ent. But many students are not
aware of the fact that Cardinals is
the driving force behind many of
the events that spark the gridiron
season.
Saturday Stanford will play
UCLA in one of the biggest games
of the year, and members of Car
dinals, headed by Pete Bing, laid
plans weeks ago for the float pa
rade Friday night.
The feverish enthusiasm which
accompanies Big Game week is a
springboard from which Cardinals
leaps to make the annual battle
with Cal the climax of the football
season. Chairmen for this year's ac
tivities, scheduled for Nov. 21, are
Chuck Kashima and Dick Kelley.
But the activities of Cardinals are
not confined to the football season,
and while many of the events are
traditional from year to year, there
is no static schedule from which
Cardinals must operate. Members
of the organization are constantly
in search of activities which need
an added boost.
This year, for instance, the
group will sponsor the Blood
Drive, something it has never un
dertaken before.
Later this quarter, Cardinals will
sponsor High School Day. Prospec
tive Stanford students from many
parts of California will travel to the
Farm, and it is the job of Cardinals,
under the direction of Jackie White
man, to provide speakers, conduct
tours of the campus, and feed an
estimated 400 visitors.
Next spring the Con Home Drive,
piloted by Bob Wilson, will be put
on under their direction,
New and transfer students will
learn that the projects delegated by
Cardinals to different campus or
ganizations and classes make the
raising of funds for the local charity
a week of fun.
Besides taking care of specific
functions, Cardinals acts as a hos
pitality committee for the Univer

sity at all times. Whenever a
conference is scheduled to take
place on the campus, Cardinals
welcomes the delegates and shows
them about the school.
The origin of Cardinals is rather
obscure. In an account of an ASSU
Excom meeting in October, 1934,
mention is made of approval of five
members of Cardinals. However, no
specific functions of the group are
given.
In May, 193(5, Cardinals was or
ganized as part of an Activities
Council.
Other subsidiaries of the Activi
ties Council were designated as
Women's Committee and Tryoutee
Committee, and these groups are no
longer in existence. With them,
Cardinals was to take charge of hos
pitality, ASSU dances, high school
programs, and Red Cross activities.

Cardinals is the student organization which acts as an operating

Every member of Cardinals heads
one or more all - campus projects
during the year and is responsible

Chairman of Cardinals this year
is junior Fred Aurel. Ruth De

three men from both the junior

Ex - officio members are ASSU
President Don Lozabnick, ASSU

During the football season, the

the driving force behind many of

season.
Saturday Stanford will play
UCLA in one of the biggest games
of the year, and members of Car
dinals, headed by Pete Bing, laid
plans weeks ago for the float pa
rade Friday night.
The feverish enthusiasm which
accompanies Big Game week is a
springboard from which Cardinals
leaps to make the annual battle
with Cal the climax of the football
season. Chairmen for this year's ac
tivities, scheduled for Nov. 21, are
Chuck Kashima and Dick Kelley.
But the activities of Cardinals are
not confined to the football season,
and while many of the events are
traditional from year to year, there
is no static schedule from which
Cardinals must operate. Members
of the organization are constantly
in search of activities which need
an added boost.
This year, for instance, the
group will sponsor the Blood
Drive, something it has never un
dertaken before.
Later this quarter, Cardinals will
sponsor High School Day. Prospec
tive Stanford students from many
parts of California will travel to the
Farm, and it is the job of Cardinals,
under the direction of Jackie White
man, to provide speakers, conduct
tours of the campus, and feed an
estimated 400 visitors.
Next spring the Con Home Drive,
piloted by Bob Wilson, will be put
on under their direction,
New and transfer students will
learn that the projects delegated by
Cardinals to different campus or
ganizations and classes make the
raising of funds for the local charity
a week of fun.
Besides taking care of specific
functions, Cardinals acts as a hos
pitality committee for the Univer

conference is scheduled to take
place on the campus, Cardinals
welcomes the delegates and shows
them about the school.
