# IRWIN JOHNSON
## Shootin’ the Breeze 
### 
There's been a lot of loose talk going around campus, helped on b.\
stirring editorials in The Daily and in the Palo Alto Times, to the effect
that Stanford has its best football in years and that Saturday's game
will result in a clearcut Indian victory.
Now we'd like nothing better than to climb on the Templeton-Grothe
bandwagon and pick Stanford to go undefeated the rest of the season
and wind up in the Rose ISowl. In fact we think the Indians have an
excellent chance of beating Washington. Washington State. USC, San
Jose State, and Cal. in the last five games of the season
But we're not foolish enough to think that Chuck Taylor's boys can
beat UCLA Saturday. Through the years the old sports maxim that "the
best team always wins" has been almost invariably true, and the Bruins
have a better team than Stanford this year.
This can be pointed out three different ways. Qne, UCLA is rated sec
ond in the nation in the INS poll ;ind filth in the AP listings, while Stanford
is not listed in the top twenty. Two, the Bruins have posted double the
number of touchdowns against PCC teams this year that the Indians have
run up. They beat Oregon 12 to 0 (Stanford 7-0) and Oregon State
41 to 0 (Stanford 21-0).
And three, UCLA is better man for man than the Cards. Paul Cameron
is almost a cinch to get the Heismann Award for the best football player
in the United States, while Coach Red Sanders has Bill Stits, Pete Dailey,
Terry Debay, Primo Villanueva, Bob Davenport, and Sam Brown, all first
rate men, to help out in the backfield.
Stanford's backfield trio of Bob Garrett, Bon Cook, and Ernie Dorn,
plus John Steinberg and Sain Morley. two good ends, and the middle of
the line, Norm Manoogian, Ted Tanner, and IMiil Wilson, will be enough
to give UCI A a close game—in fact, a better game than Cal or USC will
be able to put together.
But besides the overall backfield strength, Red Sanders has the out
standing line of the coast, with seven big boys who play defense as well
us they play offense. Kansas scored a touchdown but the Bruins held their
other three opponents scoreless, while 58 points have been scored against
Stanford in four games.
In Stanford's favor is their improvement in the last three games, phis
a tremendous spirit that has infused the first two teams. But spirit is a
nebulous thing, and despite it we're still looking for a Big Game victory
after six years.
We're not intending in any way to run our team down; we think Chuck

Taylor has at least as good a ball
club as he did if 1951, the Rose
Bowl team. But let's face it; there's
a real football powerhouse down at
Westwood this year, and San Fran
cisco sportswriters to the contrary,
the Big Game won't be played to
determine the PCC Rose Bowl rep
resentative this year.
