### DAVE BROWNWOOD 
"How would you feel if tomorrow Russia moved into San Fran
cisco?

In these words the Italian consul to San Francisco, Lionello
Cozzi, expressed the feelings of Italians toward the threatened
Yugoslav entry into the city of Trieste.

He spoke at an informal discussion*
yesterday afternoon sponsored by
the Institute of International Rela
tions at the lIR Shack.
The immediate trouble in the area
stems from a recent Anglo-Ameri
can decision to withdraw and per
mit Italian troops to occupy Zone A
of the Trieste Free Territory. Mar
shal Tito of Yugoslavia has stated
that any movement of Italian troops
into Trieste will be considered an
act of aggression against Yugoslavia.
"We arc in favor of the with
drawal," stated the Italian consul.
(Mr. Cozzi emphasized that any
opinions he expressed were not
necessarily the olTicial views of ,
the Italian government.) "But, of
course, we do not want to start a
war."
Mr. Cozzi began the discussion of!
Trieste by explaining the actual facts |
regarding the area so that his po-i
sition "could be made clear." He j
stated that the population of both (
Zones A and B of Trieste is 90 per
cent Italian and only ten per cent j
Slavic.
In regard to Yugoslavia's argu
ment that Trieste is a part of Yugo
slavia, the visitor pointed out that
there is no historical connection at I
all between Yugoslavia and the neu
tral zone.
"All territory that could con
ceivably be given to Yugoslavia

for any reason was given after j
World War 11. Trieste was not
given because it is obviously not ;
a part of Yugoslavia."
Continuing, fhe consul argued that
the southern zone of Trieste is al
ready almost annexed to Yugoslavia,
in violation of the peace treaty.
"Tito has given the Italians in
Zone B his government, his news
papers, and his religion. He has not
cooperated in trying to find a solu
tion to the problem.
We have suggested a withdrawal
of all troops and a plebiscite to find j
what the people want, but Tito has :
refused to consider the proposal. He
knows he will lose.
"Trieste is considered by Italians
to be a part of Italy, as much as
you consider San Francisco a part
of the United States. There are
many personal ties that bind us
together. If Yugoslavia should
march into Trieste it would be like
somebody coming into our front
door. Tito will have to start a war
if there is one, but we will not
run away from it."
Mr. Cozzi emphasized that Trieste
holds little strategic value for either
Italy or Yugoslavia. "Port facilities
cannot be a reason for wanting con
trol of the area, since it is a free
port anyway.
"Trieste has mainly sentimental
value to us." he stated. "Trieste is
a piece of Italy. Its main value to
Tito, I think, is that any dictator
needs outside successes to keep up
his prestige. Taking over Trieste
would be a prominent outside suc
cess for Tito."
Mr. Cozzi concluded by saying
that if a choice had to be made by
America about what to it seemed
logical to favor Italy. "If I were an
American, I would help the friend
who gave promise of being the
staunchest ally."

cannot be a reason for wanting con
trol of the area, since it is a free
port anyway.
"Trieste has mainly sentimental
value to us." he stated. "Trieste is
a piece of Italy. Its main value to
Tito, I think, is that any dictator
needs outside successes to keep up
his prestige. Taking over Trieste
would be a prominent outside suc
cess for Tito."
Mr. Cozzi concluded by saying
that if a choice had to be made by
America about what to it seemed
logical to favor Italy. "If I were an
American, I would help the friend
who gave promise of being the
staunchest ally."
"How would you feel if tomorrow Russia moved into San Fran
cisco?

In these words the Italian consul to San Francisco, Lionello
Cozzi, expressed the feelings of Italians toward the threatened
Yugoslav entry into the city of Trieste.

He spoke at an informal discussion*
yesterday afternoon sponsored by
the Institute of International Rela
tions at the lIR Shack.
The immediate trouble in the area
stems from a recent Anglo-Ameri
can decision to withdraw and per
mit Italian troops to occupy Zone A
of the Trieste Free Territory. Mar
shal Tito of Yugoslavia has stated
that any movement of Italian troops
into Trieste will be considered an
act of aggression against Yugoslavia.
"We arc in favor of the with
drawal," stated the Italian consul.
(Mr. Cozzi emphasized that any
opinions he expressed were not
necessarily the olTicial views of ,
the Italian government.) "But, of
course, we do not want to start a
war."
Mr. Cozzi began the discussion of!
Trieste by explaining the actual facts |
regarding the area so that his po-i
sition "could be made clear." He j
stated that the population of both (
Zones A and B of Trieste is 90 per
cent Italian and only ten per cent j
Slavic.
In regard to Yugoslavia's argu
ment that Trieste is a part of Yugo
slavia, the visitor pointed out that
there is no historical connection at I
all between Yugoslavia and the neu
tral zone.
"All territory that could con
ceivably be given to Yugoslavia

for any reason was given after j
World War 11. Trieste was not
given because it is obviously not ;
a part of Yugoslavia."
Continuing, fhe consul argued that
the southern zone of Trieste is al
ready almost annexed to Yugoslavia,
in violation of the peace treaty.
"Tito has given the Italians in
Zone B his government, his news
papers, and his religion. He has not
cooperated in trying to find a solu
tion to the problem.
We have suggested a withdrawal
of all troops and a plebiscite to find j
what the people want, but Tito has :
refused to consider the proposal. He
knows he will lose.
"Trieste is considered by Italians
to be a part of Italy, as much as
you consider San Francisco a part
of the United States. There are
many personal ties that bind us
together. If Yugoslavia should
march into Trieste it would be like
somebody coming into our front
door. Tito will have to start a war
if there is one, but we will not
run away from it."
Mr. Cozzi emphasized that Trieste
holds little strategic value for either
Italy or Yugoslavia. "Port facilities
cannot be a reason for wanting con
trol of the area, since it is a free
port anyway.
