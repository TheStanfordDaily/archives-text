Cameron stumbles around in the midfield, but as he neaps the goal, he
shows his true Ail-American nature. He has personally accounted for 42 of
the Bruins' 85 points. He reminds us of Stanford's Kerkorian in that he
always seems to have the game in his hip pocket.
Garrett is rough and smart, but too .slow on defense. On offense he is a
single threat back. His one asset is the ability to throw beautiful accurate
and soft spirals. His passes are almost impossible to drop. EDGE TO UCLA

Ron Cook has moved into third spot among PCC rushers after a good
day against Oregon State. He is fast, a good pass-catcher and a smart
