# Cal Silent On the Axe
## 
### 
It seemed as though the Univer
sity oi' California would have to ap
point a special finding committee to
find the Axe-finding committee yes
terday.
The committee, whose job it is to
recover the stolen Stanford Axe be
fore the annual Big Game, was
scheduled to meet yesterday to map
out plans for descending upon the
Stanford campus tomorrow in hopes
of finding the Axe here.
But word from C'al last nitfht
indicated that the committee did
not meet as planned. Cal loaders
who have been active on the Axe
recovering project were not avail
able for comment.
And, according to a UC spokes
man, the campus was virtually quiet
yesterday on the status of the Axe.
UC campus Police Chief Frank
Woodward, meanwhile, told The
Daily he has "feelers" out on the
case.
"I am more interested in getting
the Axe back than I am in gettisg
the person responsible," Woodward
said.
He said he hoped the person who
has the Axe will call him find tell
him where it is.
Woodward said it the Axe was
returned, to him anonymously he
would drop investigations and the
person who took the Axe would
not be faced with a charge of
burglary.
The police chief declared he per
sonally doubts the Axe is on the
Stanford campus but he was quick
: to add that it is "possible."
Earlier this week Marv Huff, sen
ior class president at UC, disclosed
that the Axe-finding committee had
drawn tentative plans for arriving
it Stanford tomorrow afternoon to
tour the campus in a car caravan
j and to create inter-school spirit.
Huff said the plans were to l>e
