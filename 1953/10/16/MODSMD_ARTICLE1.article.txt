## 
### 
Wayne Fuller, who for two quarters has directed the steering
committee of the Political Union, was named president of the
newly founded Union last night at a long and sometimes heated
meeting in which various political groups—Republican, Demo
crat, and independent —flaunted their colors.
As vice-president, the assemblage of about 150 students elected

Tom Maxwell, a freshman from*
Ireland, who declared himself an j
independent.
Fuller, who is a first-year law
student, said, when speaking for his
candidacy last night, although he !
had once been a Young Democrat, !
he dropped all partisan activity to j
work on the Union.
Of his candidacy, Maxwell said, j
'in the making of the Political
Union, I feel that it should be con
ceived as a forum from which we
will all gain information and skill
which will pertain to our duties
as citizens of the University and
of the world."
Fuller, who helped frame the Po
litical Union constitution, presented j
the document for Executive Com
mittee approval one week ago.
The vice-president, who is en
rolled as a freshman history stu- i
dent, already holds a degree from
Ihe Institute of Technology in
Belfast. He has held engineering
jobs in London, the Middle East,
and in Texas.
After the meeting, which was held
in Cubberley Auditorium, leaders of
both the off-campus Young Repub
licans and Young Democrats said |
they believed their membership
would co-operate whole - heartedly
with the new Union.
Keynote speaker at the first meet
ing of the Union was Dr. Graham
Stuart, professor emeritus of politi- j
cal science, who said:
"The basis of any political union
is to appeal to ropson to get the
facts, to discuss them intelligently, j
and to draw logical conclusions.
Following Stuart's speech, Chuck !
Goff, representing the independents,
.John Blom. for the Republicans, and
Hal Rogers, for the Democrats, out
lined their political beliefs.
Bill Fundenberg, a past chairman j
of the student-faculty policial com
mittee and a member of the Union
steering committee, acted as chair
man.
After the presentation of party
policies and the election of Union
officers, the group broke down into
caucuses to form Union parties.
