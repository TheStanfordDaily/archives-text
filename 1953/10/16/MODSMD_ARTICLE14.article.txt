# San Jose Plans Semester System
## 
### 
San Jose State College was ex
pected to replacc its current quar
ter system with the semester pro
gram in the fall of 1955 on a recom
mendation by college president
John T. Wahlquist.
Although education and journal
ism faculty members oppose the
plan, pointing out that it will spoil
their teaching and field training
programs, the plan probably will be
adopted, according to Joe H. West,
dean of students and chairman of a
faculty committee which is consid
ering the proposal.
Wahlquist said that the semester
system would cure certain admin
istrative ills in procedure.
