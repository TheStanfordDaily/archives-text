STOCKHOLM. Sweden, Oct. 15
(UP) â€” Winston Churchill today
won the Nobel' Prize for Literature
not only for his writings but for
his wartime speeches that rallied
the free world against a "monstrous
tyranny never surpassed in the
dark, lamentable catalogue of hu
man crimes."
The Swedish Academy of Litera
ture, in voting the $33,600 prize to
the 78-year-old British Prime Min

the enduring quality of the spoken
word. All of the past 47 Nobel
Prizes have been awarded for writ
ings only.
The Swedish Academy said that
Churchill had been chosen "for his
mastery of historical and biographi
cal description as well as for the
brilliant art of oration with which
he has defended high human val
ues."
