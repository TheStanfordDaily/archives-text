# CARDS TO BATTLE BOWL-BOUND BRUINS
## Indian Eleven Seeks Upset Over Cameron & Company 
### PHIL BERMAN 
The Stanford footballers will be "shooting the works" tomorrow
when they host the favored UCLA Bruins in the Stadium. KickoU
is 2 p.m.
A win for Coach Chuck Taylor's red-shirted Indians would
move them up among the nation's football elite, as the visitor:;

'from Westwood are undefeated in
four starts this season, dnd arc rated
well up in all the press association
polls. The Bruins are also the cm •
rent favorite to wind up in the Ro.>>:
Bowl New Year's Day.
However, the Cards, who will
place a two won and two Inst re<
ord on the line tomorrow, have
been looking forward all week in
upending UCLA and maybe even
slipping into a trip to I'asadcna
themselves since both clubs are
presently tied for the lead in the
Pacilc Coast Conference with 12-0
records.
Defeating Red Sanders' eleven in. •
seem nice on paper, but on the field
it will be a rugged job for the In
dians.
To do this, the Stanfords will have
to do something no other team ha',
done this year—halt the Bruins' tail
back, Paul Cameron.
Cameron, who was rated a pn •
season All-American by practically
everyone, and is an old-fashioned

"triple-threat" back in every sen ,t
of the word, has, thus far this season,
more than lived up to his press clip
pings.
Besides leading the Pacific Coa.\
Conference in rushing with 238 net
yards, the Burbank Bomber person
ally leads the UCLA squad in six
different offensive departments
rushing, passing, punting, pass inter ■
ceptions, and kiekoff and punt re
turns.
Cameron, of course, gets in on
practically every play for the Bruin
when he in in the lineup since tin
use the single wing type of offense,
with Paul, as mentioned before, op
erating as the tailback.
Succinctly, this means that in
the single wing formation the
quarterback becomes the blocking
back rather than the ball handler,
while the tailback receives a di
rect pass from center and has the
option of either running or pass
ing with the ball.
However, don't get the idea that
the Bruins are just a one-man gang.
Two other excellent men are in the
UCLA starting backfield. Bill Stit ,
a fine defensive halfback last season,
has come into his own on offense tin
year and has averaged over nin<
yards per carry this year, while Pete
Dailey is a light, but hustling full
back. Soph Bob Davenport also .sec ,
plenty of action at fullback.
That is the backfield that llic
Cardinals will have to contend wilii
and try and halt, but even if they
can hold Cameron and Co. in check,
they are going to be running into
one of the nations top defensive
lines when they have the ball.
There is no one spectacular line
man for the Bruins, hut they are a
group of veteran players all with
pretty much the same ability. They
also run plenty deep.
For instance, at the left guard spot.
Co-Captain Rudy Feldman and Sam
Bogohasian, were supposed to have
the first call, when along came 6 ft.
2 in., 220 pound soph transfer Hardi
man Cureton to move both of them
back a notch. Feldman is getting the
starting call tomorrow, but the two
others should see plenty of action.
At the other guard Jim Salsbury
is a defensive giant, while Chuck
Doud and Jack Ellena at the tackles
are another fine pair.
The center pair of Ira Pauly and
John Petersen is another fine duo,
while diminutive Myron Berliner,
although not much on offense is still
another defensive standout as is Bob
Heydenfeldt.
In fact, the UCLA team has been
so tough to move against this sea
son, they have surrendered but sev
en points in their four previous wins,
that was to their second opponent,
Kansas, who bowed 19 to 7.
Blanked were Oregon State, Ore
gon, and Wisconsin, 41-0, 12-0, and
13-0, respectively.
On the Stanford side of the ledg
er. the Indians have looked good in
practice all week and have been
improving in every game this year
since the disastrous opener against
COP.
Quarterback Bobby Garrett has
shown plenty in his last two games
and his arm just may do the job,
and ends Sam Morley and John
Steinberg are the two top pass
catchers in the conference, while
soph Ernie Dorn and veteran Ron
Cook just seem to be coming into
their own at the halfback spots.
Probable starting lineups:
STANFORD UCLA
Morley LER Berliner
Armitage LTR Doud
Manoogian LOR Salsbury
Tanner C Peterson
Wilson RGL Feldman
Smith RTL Ellena

Defeating Red Sanders' eleven in. •
seem nice on paper, but on the field
it will be a rugged job for the In
dians.
To do this, the Stanfords will have
to do something no other team ha',
done this year—halt the Bruins' tail
back, Paul Cameron.
Cameron, who was rated a pn •
season All-American by practically
everyone, and is an old-fashioned

"triple-threat" back in every sen ,t
of the word, has, thus far this season,
more than lived up to his press clip
pings.
Besides leading the Pacific Coa.\
Conference in rushing with 238 net
yards, the Burbank Bomber person
ally leads the UCLA squad in six
different offensive departments
rushing, passing, punting, pass inter ■
ceptions, and kiekoff and punt re
turns.
Cameron, of course, gets in on
practically every play for the Bruin
when he in in the lineup since tin
use the single wing type of offense,
with Paul, as mentioned before, op
erating as the tailback.
Succinctly, this means that in
the single wing formation the
quarterback becomes the blocking
back rather than the ball handler,
while the tailback receives a di
rect pass from center and has the
option of either running or pass
ing with the ball.
However, don't get the idea that
the Bruins are just a one-man gang.
Two other excellent men are in the
UCLA starting backfield. Bill Stit ,
a fine defensive halfback last season,
has come into his own on offense tin
year and has averaged over nin<
yards per carry this year, while Pete
Dailey is a light, but hustling full
back. Soph Bob Davenport also .sec ,
plenty of action at fullback.
That is the backfield that llic
Cardinals will have to contend wilii
and try and halt, but even if they
can hold Cameron and Co. in check,
they are going to be running into
one of the nations top defensive
lines when they have the ball.
There is no one spectacular line
man for the Bruins, hut they are a
group of veteran players all with
pretty much the same ability. They
also run plenty deep.
For instance, at the left guard spot.
Co-Captain Rudy Feldman and Sam
Bogohasian, were supposed to have
the first call, when along came 6 ft.
2 in., 220 pound soph transfer Hardi
man Cureton to move both of them
back a notch. Feldman is getting the
starting call tomorrow, but the two
others should see plenty of action.
At the other guard Jim Salsbury
is a defensive giant, while Chuck
Doud and Jack Ellena at the tackles
are another fine pair.
The center pair of Ira Pauly and
John Petersen is another fine duo,
while diminutive Myron Berliner,
although not much on offense is still
another defensive standout as is Bob
Heydenfeldt.
In fact, the UCLA team has been
so tough to move against this sea
son, they have surrendered but sev
en points in their four previous wins,
that was to their second opponent,
Kansas, who bowed 19 to 7.
Blanked were Oregon State, Ore
gon, and Wisconsin, 41-0, 12-0, and
13-0, respectively.
On the Stanford side of the ledg
er. the Indians have looked good in
practice all week and have been
improving in every game this year
since the disastrous opener against
COP.
Quarterback Bobby Garrett has
shown plenty in his last two games
and his arm just may do the job,
and ends Sam Morley and John
Steinberg are the two top pass
catchers in the conference, while
soph Ernie Dorn and veteran Ron
Cook just seem to be coming into
their own at the halfback spots.

LOOK OUT CARDS —UCLA's two tough tackles, Jack Ellena

when he in in the lineup since tin
use the single wing type of offense,
with Paul, as mentioned before, op
erating as the tailback.
Succinctly, this means that in
the single wing formation the
quarterback becomes the blocking
back rather than the ball handler,
while the tailback receives a di
rect pass from center and has the
option of either running or pass
ing with the ball.
However, don't get the idea that
the Bruins are just a one-man gang.
Two other excellent men are in the
UCLA starting backfield. Bill Stit ,
a fine defensive halfback last season,
has come into his own on offense tin
year and has averaged over nin<
yards per carry this year, while Pete
Dailey is a light, but hustling full
back. Soph Bob Davenport also .sec ,
plenty of action at fullback.
That is the backfield that llic
Cardinals will have to contend wilii
and try and halt, but even if they
can hold Cameron and Co. in check,
they are going to be running into
one of the nations top defensive
lines when they have the ball.
There is no one spectacular line
man for the Bruins, hut they are a
group of veteran players all with
pretty much the same ability. They
also run plenty deep.
For instance, at the left guard spot.
Co-Captain Rudy Feldman and Sam
Bogohasian, were supposed to have
the first call, when along came 6 ft.
2 in., 220 pound soph transfer Hardi
man Cureton to move both of them
back a notch. Feldman is getting the
starting call tomorrow, but the two
others should see plenty of action.
At the other guard Jim Salsbury
is a defensive giant, while Chuck
Doud and Jack Ellena at the tackles
are another fine pair.
The center pair of Ira Pauly and
John Petersen is another fine duo,
while diminutive Myron Berliner,
although not much on offense is still
another defensive standout as is Bob
Heydenfeldt.
In fact, the UCLA team has been
so tough to move against this sea
son, they have surrendered but sev
en points in their four previous wins,
that was to their second opponent,
Kansas, who bowed 19 to 7.
Blanked were Oregon State, Ore
gon, and Wisconsin, 41-0, 12-0, and
13-0, respectively.
On the Stanford side of the ledg
er. the Indians have looked good in
practice all week and have been
improving in every game this year
since the disastrous opener against
COP.
Quarterback Bobby Garrett has
shown plenty in his last two games
and his arm just may do the job,
and ends Sam Morley and John
Steinberg are the two top pass
catchers in the conference, while
soph Ernie Dorn and veteran Ron
Cook just seem to be coming into
their own at the halfback spots.
Probable starting lineups:
STANFORD UCLA
Morley LER Berliner
Armitage LTR Doud

LOOK OUT CARDS —UCLA's two tough tackles, Jack Ellena
(top) and Co-Captain Chuck Doud, are expected to hand out
more of their bone-jarring tackles against Stanford tomorrow.
The Stanford footballers will be "shooting the works" tomorrow
when they host the favored UCLA Bruins in the Stadium. KickoU
is 2 p.m.
A win for Coach Chuck Taylor's red-shirted Indians would
move them up among the nation's football elite, as the visitor:;

'from Westwood are undefeated in
four starts this season, dnd arc rated
well up in all the press association
polls. The Bruins are also the cm •
rent favorite to wind up in the Ro.>>:
Bowl New Year's Day.
However, the Cards, who will
place a two won and two Inst re<
ord on the line tomorrow, have
been looking forward all week in
upending UCLA and maybe even
slipping into a trip to I'asadcna
themselves since both clubs are
presently tied for the lead in the
Pacilc Coast Conference with 12-0
records.
Defeating Red Sanders' eleven in. •
seem nice on paper, but on the field
it will be a rugged job for the In
dians.
To do this, the Stanfords will have
to do something no other team ha',
done this year—halt the Bruins' tail
back, Paul Cameron.
Cameron, who was rated a pn •
season All-American by practically
everyone, and is an old-fashioned

"triple-threat" back in every sen ,t
of the word, has, thus far this season,
more than lived up to his press clip
pings.
Besides leading the Pacific Coa.\
Conference in rushing with 238 net
yards, the Burbank Bomber person
ally leads the UCLA squad in six
different offensive departments
rushing, passing, punting, pass inter ■
ceptions, and kiekoff and punt re
