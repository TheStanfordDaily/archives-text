# CARDS TO BATTLE BOWL-BOUND BRUINS
## Indian Eleven Seeks Upset Over Cameron & Company 
### PHIL BERMAN 
The Stanford footballers will be "shooting the works" tomorrow
when they host the favored UCLA Bruins in the Stadium. KickoU
is 2 p.m.
A win for Coach Chuck Taylor's red-shirted Indians would
move them up among the nation's football elite, as the visitor:;

'from Westwood are undefeated in
four starts this season, dnd arc rated
well up in all the press association
polls. The Bruins are also the cm •
rent favorite to wind up in the Ro.>>:
Bowl New Year's Day.
However, the Cards, who will
place a two won and two Inst re<
ord on the line tomorrow, have
been looking forward all week in
upending UCLA and maybe even
slipping into a trip to I'asadcna
themselves since both clubs are
presently tied for the lead in the
Pacilc Coast Conference with 12-0
records.
Defeating Red Sanders' eleven in. •
seem nice on paper, but on the field
it will be a rugged job for the In
dians.
To do this, the Stanfords will have
to do something no other team ha',
done this year—halt the Bruins' tail
back, Paul Cameron.
Cameron, who was rated a pn •
season All-American by practically
everyone, and is an old-fashioned

"triple-threat" back in every sen ,t
of the word, has, thus far this season,
more than lived up to his press clip
pings.
Besides leading the Pacific Coa.\
Conference in rushing with 238 net
yards, the Burbank Bomber person
ally leads the UCLA squad in six
different offensive departments
rushing, passing, punting, pass inter ■
ceptions, and kiekoff and punt re
turns.
Cameron, of course, gets in on
practically every play for the Bruin
when he in in the lineup since tin
use the single wing type of offense,
with Paul, as mentioned before, op
erating as the tailback.
Succinctly, this means that in
the single wing formation the
quarterback becomes the blocking
back rather than the ball handler,
while the tailback receives a di
rect pass from center and has the
option of either running or pass
ing with the ball.
However, don't get the idea that
the Bruins are just a one-man gang.
Two other excellent men are in the
UCLA starting backfield. Bill Stit ,
a fine defensive halfback last season,
has come into his own on offense tin
year and has averaged over nin<
yards per carry this year, while Pete
Dailey is a light, but hustling full
back. Soph Bob Davenport also .sec ,
plenty of action at fullback.
That is the backfield that llic
Cardinals will have to contend wilii
and try and halt, but even if they
