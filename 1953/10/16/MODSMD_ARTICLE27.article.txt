# For a Decisive Decision
## 
### 
We hope that within the next week, members
of the Executive Committee will study seriously
the opinions of their constituents on the seem
ingly perennial issue: Should Stanford join the
National Students Association.
And when Excom convenes at its appointed
time next Wednesday, we hope its members
can decide conclusively on this issue that has
faced Stanford almost annually since the in
ception of the national group in 1947.
Through most of last year, Excom puzzled
over the problem, finally deciding that the Uni
versity should not join the organization.
But even with a vote taken, Excom found
itself still plagued with a number of 'disturbing
guestions that unsettled any conviction that
the matter was closed.
Recognizing its indecision, Excom, at its last
meeting Spring Quarter, authorized ASSU Pres
ident Don Lozabnick to act as an observer for
Stanford at the NSA Congress (which was held
during the summer at Ohio State) and to report
his conclusions.
Lozabnick presented his report, a neutral,
well weighed and objective document that ex
presses no bias pro or con—at the Excom meet
ing Wednesday evening. Alice Kwong, off cam

pus women's representative, who also attended
the summer confab and who is violently pro
NSA, also expressed her views at the meeting,
as did Steve Voykovich, a former vice presi
dent of the association who is now a graduate
student here.
With this personal, first hand commentary on
the record and with reams of other testimony
taken during the six years since Stanford was
first approached for membership in NSA, pres
ent student legislators should have ample ref
erence to make a decisive decision, one that
will mark the finale of a tough and controver
sial issue.
To that verbal testimony they ; can add the
reports from that two year period late in 1947
to 1949, when this University participated
somewhat half heartedly in the then nascent
NSA program.
Evidence and opinion on the issue are avail
able in large guantity. The only essential thing
lacking at this point is an expression of senti
ment on the part of the student body.
To round up and evaluate this opinion is now
the crucial duty of Excom members —as they
no doubt fully realize—and one which, we
hope and urge, they will pursue with full de
termination and diligence.
