# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
As one who is really not overly concerned about
how much that doggie in the window costs or just
what the identity of the person is who was crude
enough to toss a pair of overalls in Mrs. Murphy's
chowder, I would like to throw out a few observa
tions on songs. Or to be more accurate, song lyrics.
Now, I have nothing against lyricists personally. I
am sure that most of them love their wives, help

old ladies across the street, and
contribute to the Red Cross every
year. It's just that I think most
of them forget to read their lyrics
after they write them. Otherwise
they would change them pronto.
For example, have you noticed
that men always get racked up in
songs? Not women. They are al
ways glamorous, amorous, en
chanting, and sweet - smelling.
But no, not men. Joe is told.

"Don't cry, Joe." Jim is a heel of the first order.
"Jim never sends me pretty flowers." And poor Bill,
he really gets chopped. "Along came Bill, an ordi
nary guy. He hasn't got a thing that I can brag about.
I can't explain. It's surely not his brain."
No wonder with lyrics like this that there are
people sitting around, crying in the chapel.
Have you ever listened carefully to the words in

the old standby, "Home on the Range"? It starts out,
"Oh, give me a home where the buffalo roam."
Now, as one observer pointed out, thus is a helluva
home. How would you like to have a herd of wild
buffalo knocking around in your living room. But
that's not all. The song continues: "where the deer
and the antelope play." It's bad enough that you've
got the patter of buffalo feet in your house, but on
top of that you've got deer and antelope playing.
Why, the house would be a shambles.
It's small wonder that with a house like that, there's
someone "walking behind you." It's all those damn
buffalo, deer, and antelope.
Then there's the ditty about some poor guy who
is "always chasing rainbows." Further, he is "watch
ing clouds drifting by." Oh, this fellow has it bad.
And why is this guy chasing rainbows and watching
drifting clouds? Is he an artist after a colorful pic
ture? No, the reason he's doing all this is because he
is "waiting for a little blue bird, in vain." That's
what the song says.
Well, that's only a few samples. We won't go into
the pros and cons of whether diamonds really are a
girl's best friend, or whether the best things in life
are free, or about the guy who intones the absurdity,
"Drink to me only with thine eyes."
Yep, with lyrics like the above being ground out,
it's small wonder that my mother was crying, my
father was crying, and I was crying too.
