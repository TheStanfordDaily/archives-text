# CAMPUS OPINION
## 'An Imminent Sanctuary' 
### 
To the Editor:
This morning's Daily carried some shocking news
for the newcomer to Stanford. It is little short of ap
palling that in 1953 one should be able to find so
eminent a sanctuary of unreality, where the role of
the citizen in a democracy is carefully shielded from
the student, ll is a shocking revelation of Stanford's
unstated philosophy of education, a philosophy which
obviously says that the student shall be safeguarded
from a knowledge of the world reality, his surround
ings, until he attains a degree from the ideal world of
the academy.
If Stanford were located in a distant province, far
from the reaches of the active political world, the
lack of political concern on its campus would be in
significant; but that it is in the state that currently
boasts a vice-president and a chief justice, the lack
of political facility should be cause for real concern on
the part of students, faculty, administration, and
alumni. When; is the iron hand that must have quell
ed the active political interest in the last national
election?
Thomas Jefferson maintained that education was
the foundation stone upon which a successful de
mocracy would luiild. Was he speaking of the ivory
tower variety of hooks and scholarship only, or did
he have in mind the possibility that students of a
mature democracy would l»e able to use their aca
demic advantage to acquire insight into the prac
tical problems of citizenship?
Certainly in 1953. it does not appear that a univer
sity of the size and caliber of Stanford can ignore
the reality that political literacy is necessary for the
survival of democracy. A university that does ignore
this fact is violating one of its most important trusts
as the educator of America's citizenrv. For the

doctor, engineer, lawyer, psychologist, teacher, any
one, the role of the citizen"in a modern democracy is
preeminently important in today's university cur
riculum, yes, in its extra-curriculum, too.
It appears that perhaps Stanford is coming of age,
that at long last it is getting its first pair of long po
litical pants. Hut does the appearance of a political
union on a campus which prohibits active political
campaigning signify anything more than the first
steps of an infant?
That tonight's organizational meeting is our first
baby step is further indicated by the careful forma
tive clauses in the union charter. For instance, why
deny organization to a political party which can claim
only 10 per cent of the union's membership? Is the
25 per cent minimum designed to prevent the citi
zenry and officialdom of Sacramento from seeing a
rial, live socialist party function? Or can it be that in
the state which produced Sen. Nixon, fear still per
sists that Communists will prove embarrassingly nu
merous among our student bodies?
Apparently Stanford is gun-shy of someone; appar
ently the ruling hand has not committed itself to un
reserved faith in the product of free discussion and
public contention; apparently the conservatism that
is at the helm of Stanford is of the sort that believes
students to be unduly gullible and susceptible to
propaganda; finding the facts and reasoning from
them should not be the students' domain. Even though
paternalism is not justifiable from the democratic
standpoint, it is safer than lctfing students think and
opiniate for themselves.
I shall be interested to watch the development of
the political union, but I would almost predict that
it will suffer a premature death, having been planted
in too sterile a plot to mature.

one, the role of the citizen"in a modern democracy is
preeminently important in today's university cur
riculum, yes, in its extra-curriculum, too.
It appears that perhaps Stanford is coming of age,
that at long last it is getting its first pair of long po
litical pants. Hut does the appearance of a political
union on a campus which prohibits active political
campaigning signify anything more than the first
steps of an infant?
That tonight's organizational meeting is our first
baby step is further indicated by the careful forma
tive clauses in the union charter. For instance, why
deny organization to a political party which can claim
only 10 per cent of the union's membership? Is the
25 per cent minimum designed to prevent the citi
zenry and officialdom of Sacramento from seeing a
rial, live socialist party function? Or can it be that in
the state which produced Sen. Nixon, fear still per
sists that Communists will prove embarrassingly nu
merous among our student bodies?
Apparently Stanford is gun-shy of someone; appar
ently the ruling hand has not committed itself to un
reserved faith in the product of free discussion and
public contention; apparently the conservatism that
is at the helm of Stanford is of the sort that believes
students to be unduly gullible and susceptible to
propaganda; finding the facts and reasoning from
them should not be the students' domain. Even though
paternalism is not justifiable from the democratic
standpoint, it is safer than lctfing students think and
opiniate for themselves.
I shall be interested to watch the development of
the political union, but I would almost predict that
it will suffer a premature death, having been planted
in too sterile a plot to mature.

This morning's Daily carried some shocking news
for the newcomer to Stanford. It is little short of ap
palling that in 1953 one should be able to find so
eminent a sanctuary of unreality, where the role of
the citizen in a democracy is carefully shielded from
the student, ll is a shocking revelation of Stanford's
unstated philosophy of education, a philosophy which
obviously says that the student shall be safeguarded
from a knowledge of the world reality, his surround
ings, until he attains a degree from the ideal world of
the academy.
If Stanford were located in a distant province, far
from the reaches of the active political world, the
lack of political concern on its campus would be in
significant; but that it is in the state that currently
boasts a vice-president and a chief justice, the lack
of political facility should be cause for real concern on
the part of students, faculty, administration, and
alumni. When; is the iron hand that must have quell
ed the active political interest in the last national
election?
Thomas Jefferson maintained that education was
the foundation stone upon which a successful de
mocracy would luiild. Was he speaking of the ivory
tower variety of hooks and scholarship only, or did
he have in mind the possibility that students of a
mature democracy would l»e able to use their aca
demic advantage to acquire insight into the prac
tical problems of citizenship?
Certainly in 1953. it does not appear that a univer
sity of the size and caliber of Stanford can ignore
the reality that political literacy is necessary for the
survival of democracy. A university that does ignore
this fact is violating one of its most important trusts
as the educator of America's citizenrv. For the

doctor, engineer, lawyer, psychologist, teacher, any
one, the role of the citizen"in a modern democracy is
preeminently important in today's university cur
riculum, yes, in its extra-curriculum, too.
