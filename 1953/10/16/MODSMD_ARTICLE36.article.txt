# Varsity Soccermen to Battle S.F. State in Stadium Prelim
## 
### 
Stanford Stadium will be the site
ol a soccer game for the first time
tomorrow when Stanford's varsity
hooters host San Francisco State at
11:30 a.m. as a preliminary to the
Stanford-UCLA football clash.
The Northern California intercol
legiate soccer match will be the
second for the Indians, following
their 2-0 win over City College of

San Francisco last week.
Coach Leo Weinstein may be
forced to shuffle his regular lineup
because four first-stringers are on
the injury list. The doubtful start
ers are Neils Vinding, left wing;
Sam Suarez, left inside; Swaroop
Bhandjeo, center forward; and Dick
Koenigsberger, right wing.
Chuck Andrews, however, an Ail-
American transfer from San Fran
cisco State, will be ready to go
against his old teammates at his
right inside position.
The remainder of Weinstein's
starting lineup includes Ken Woods
at goal, John Sentous and John
Hanna at fullback slots, and Sam
Register, Derek Liecty, and Peter
Mack at the halfbacks.
