,Two All-American guards, Chuck
Taylor and Norm Manoogian, Dean
of Students Donald Winbigler. and
four Daily sports scribes crawl out
on a limb together as The Daily in
augurates its 1953 edition of the
Peerless Prognostications.
Winbigler, Manoogian, Taylor,
and Don Stephens look for Stan
ford to upset the Bruins in tomor
row's titanic, while Daily scribes
Phil Berman, Mike Hudson, and Ir
win Johnson predict a UCLA
Slaughter. They would like nothing
better than to miss this one.

Taylor, who through the years has
shown a fondness for picking the
long shots, was impressed enough
with Oregon to pick them over
Washington, despite the Huskies'
13-13 tie with USC last week. He
goes along with the rest of the pick
ers. however, in agreeing that Cal
will murder Joe Ulmless San Jose
State on Saturday.
Biggest split among the pickers
finds four out of seven experts (?)
picking Georgia's aerial circus to
down LSU's stubborn eleven in the
Southland's game of the week.
