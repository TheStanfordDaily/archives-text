### BILL JONES 
Twenty-eight years ago, Stanford
and UCLA met on the gridiron for
the first time.
UCLA, then known as the Uni
versity of California, Southern
Branch, came to Stanford with a
good seasonal record behind them.
Stanford likewise had a good rec
ord, but a series of serious injuries
had dimmed the Cards' hopes.
Ernie Nevers, Stanford's great
All-American, was unable to play
because of an injury sustained in
the Washington game the previ
ous week. Many other first-string
ers were out of action, and the
second string was in charge.
The first time Stanford got the
ball they scored. Don Hill ran 25.
Dick Hyland 35, and then Hill went
over. The Indians had gone 70 yards
in three plays.
The next time Stanford got the
ball, Hyland, at present a sports-

writer with the Los Angeles Times,
returned a punt 35 yards to score
At this point the game was only
four minutes old.
The final score was 82-0. Stan
ford. with the benefit of only two
first-stringers, had run up one of
the largest scores in its history.
