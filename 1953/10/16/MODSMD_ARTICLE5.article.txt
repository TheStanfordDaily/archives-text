SEOUL, Korea, Friday, Oct. 16
(UP) â€”President and Mrs. Syngman
Rhee narrowly escaped serious in
jury today when they were mobbed
by hysterical war widows and moth
ers during a memorial service for
Korean war dead.
The screaming women and old
Korean men swarmed around the
77-year-old chief executive and his
wife as they left Seoul Stadium for
the return trip to the presidential
mansion.
The president and his wife were
jostled and pushed by the hysterical
women as they attempted to reach
their automobile. National police
and the presidential bodyguard fi
nally cleared a path through the
crowd. The women attempted to
halt the vehicle after Rhee and his
wife got into the car.
