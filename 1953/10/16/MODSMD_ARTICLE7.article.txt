# UC Axe Group Visit to Farm Questionable
## 
### 
Ralph Vetterlein, president of,
the Associated Students of Uni
versity of California, yesterday
denied knowing anything about
the UC Axe-finding committee's
reported plans for visiting the
Stanford campus today.
"As far as I know," Vetterlein
said, "we were never planning to I
come down to Stanford on Friday. 1
Maybe one or two persons, but i
never en masse."
Vctterlein's comment contra
dicted a statement issued earlier
this week by Marv HulT, UC sen
ior class president and a member |
of the committee, that a "convoy"
of Axe-finding committee mem- j
Iters planned to tour the Stanford j
campus today in an attempt to ;
bolster interest in the Axe, which
was stolen from the Berkeley
campus last June.
Huff was not available for fur
ther comment last night.
Vetterlein also disclosed he will \
meet with ASSU President Don
Lozabnick and Dean of Students H.
Donald Winbigler Wednesday to
work out the Big Game non-aggres- J
sion pact between Stanford and Cal. j
"We'll possibly sign it then," he
added.
The ASUC president said the Axe
finding committee at UC met this
week to discuss how to get the Axe
back "from the people who have it."
Vetterlein was asked if the people
who have it are students.
"Yes, it could be," he replied.
"It's a question of the person
alities involved," he explained.
"We don't want to get the law in
on it. You see, there are compli
cations there. It's an offense on
the record, like breaking into a
bank or something.
"We've had lots of leads that |
we've been following," he added. |
"And all the leads are leading to j
the same parties."
Asked how Cal students were i
taking the news about the Axe, Vet
terlein commented:
"Well, it's just that it's our Axe
and we're going to- get it. We're
pretty sure we'll have the Axe with- i
in two weeks."
