# Big Three Powers Reach Tentative Trieste Accord
## 
### UNITED PRESS 
Secretary of State John Foster Dulles left London for home
yesterday by plane after his talks with Foreign Secretary Anthony
Eden of Britain and Foreign Minister Georges Bidault of France.
Dulles said the meeting was "extremely satisfactory—one of
the best of its kind."
On the Trieste question the foreign ministers said they would

persevere in joint efforts to bring*
about a lasting settlement" of the I
tug-of-war between Italy and Yu- |
goslavia over the Adriatic territory.
They reached no final decisions,
other than to stand by previous de
cisions. Authoritative sources said
no date was set for the withdrawal i
of Anulo - American troops from
Zone A, and that the three powers
had asked Italy and Yugoslavia to
meet with them to seek an amicable \
settlement of the Trieste crisis, pre
cipitated by an Anglo-American de
cision to hand over Zone A to Italy.
I'n Belgrade, President Tito said
yesterday a clash is inevitable if
Italian troops enter Zone A of
Trieste under Anglo - American
protection, hut appeared to he
backing down from previous stern
statements.
But Yugoslavs will not fight
against their American and British
allies, Tito sairl as Yugoslav officials
put eleventh-hour pressure on the
Big Three foreign ministers' meet
ing in London.
Tito's suggestion that the Trieste
decision he "modified, at least so
we can talk about it." appeared to
indicate he would accept eventu
ally the basic idea of dividing the
Trieste territory with Italy, if it
could be arranged through con
sultations.
However, said Tito, "if the Italian ;
troops were to enter under the pro
tection of the Anglo - American ■
troops—in other words, under the j
protection of the Atlantic Treaty— .
that would cause a catastrophic re
action."
