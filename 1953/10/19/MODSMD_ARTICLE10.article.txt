### PETE OROTHE Sports Editor, The Daily 
WOW. no. double WOW, and Mr.
Printer, please put those WOW's in
capital letters.
In an electrifying 21 to 20 Frank
Merriwell triumph, Stanford's men
of the gridiron provided fans with i
one of the five most exciting con- j
tests in Card football history. :
They've been playing football ;
around here since 1892.
Different persons reacted to the j
contest in different ways. The Uc- {
lans, who had trekked 500 miles lo ;
see their "nation's best team" get
beat, were morose and unconsolablc.
Cameron refused to talk lit re
porters and Sanders mumbled,
"Don't reckon I feel like talking
to reporters, but I will."
In startling contrast to the Bruin
grief was the Stanford rooting con
tingent's screaming enthusiasm.
Among the most vocal fans were:
1. Bob Mathias, new to the sport
of spcctatoring, who gasped, "The
greatest I've ever seen."
2. Daily reporter Phil Berman, up
in the press box, who got so excited
that he spilled a bottle of coke over
Chronicle Sports Editor Bill Leiser's
head and back.
Leiscr. who was so excited
that he didn't notice it.
Among the least vocal were:
1. Stanford criticizer and L.A.
Times sports scribe Dick Hyland.
who probably wrote that the Bruins
had too many milkshakes.
2. L.A. Exa in i ne r columnist
Vincent X. Flaherty, Stanford
hater, who after the great USC
game two years ago wrote that all
Los Angeles athletes should stay
j south and not go to Stanford.
But the Indian rooters were all
bubblingly happy as they went
home to swab their throats and
think happy thoughts about the
Rose Bowl.
