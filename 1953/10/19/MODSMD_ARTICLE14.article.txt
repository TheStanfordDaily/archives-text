# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
BRUIN AT THE BAT
II looked extremely rocky for the Stanford squad
that day;
The score stood 13 to 7 with but one half left to play.
All day long the Indian had acted very tame.
A fact which wreathed the features of Card patrons

of the game.
"That's right," cried Red Sanders,
his voice extremely hoarse.
"There is no mistake—of course.
Obviously there can be no con
liiction.
It's us by two touchdowns in
Leiser's prediction."
So Wcntworth took the Pigskin to
■ the Bruin forty-four.

The Uclan rooters cried, "For the Indians, no more!"
The plea came true as the Red Injun fumbled.
And later, Cam'ron for the goal rumbled.
When Dailey kicked the extra point out of Stits'
hand,
Sanders shouted, "Hey, we're best in the land.
We'll win every game for a hundred years.
A big six, locomotive, and 15 cheers."
liv.it Stanford came roaring back as Garrett passed
left, then light.
And let the ball whiz away in its long trajectory
flight.
Morley easily took the ball for an Indian score,
And Rubin and his rooters were alive once more.
Across the way, Lilians let up a moaning cry,
And Red. drawling Red. dabbed a hankie to his eye.
"No, no . . . no, no," cried the Baby Blue headman.
"We have got to stop that upstart Redman."
From the benches, black with people, there went up
a muffled roar.

Like the beating of the storm waves on the stern and
distant shore.
A straggling few got up to go, leaving there the rest,
With that hope which springs eternal within the
human breast.
Chuck Taylor was really getting mad.
And he shouted to Garrett, "The Bruin must be had."
So Garrett, mighty Garrett, threw a bullet to Sam.
And Morley jumped and took it in the midst of a
player jam.
A time out ended with a Stanford band refrain,
And no one could doubt that Stanford would cross
that goal again.
So when Garrett, mighty Garrett, put his hand upon
the bladder,
Red, drawling Red, knew that something was the
matter.
Garrett cocked his arm and let the porker fly.
And it made its historic course across the sunny
Stanford sky.
Napoleon neatly took it and crossed the Bruin goal
As 50,000 persons shook the massive Stanford Bowl.
Then Red, drawling Bed, let out a sobbing yell.
That resounded through the Stadium and echoed in
the dell.
It bent the grass on that embattled, sodden arena,
And knocked a piece of plaster off crumbling, archaic
Encina.
Oh, everywhere on this favored Farm, the sun is
shining bright.
The Cellar "roughs" are happy, and Quad hearts are
light.
And at Rickey's and at L'Ommies, Stanford fratmen
sin.
But there is no joy in Westwood, mighty Bruin
didn't win.
