By ROY BROUN
The United States National
Student Association is an or
ganization of college student
bodies, represented through
their student governments.
II began in 15)40. when 25 Ameri
can students attended the World
Student Congress in Prague, Czech
oslovakia, and became aware that
the United States was almost the
only country without a representa
tive student organization.
Jn September, 1947, the constitu
tional convention of NSA was held
at the University of Wisconsin, and
at that time students from more
than 350 colleges established the
constitution of NSA and mapped its
program.
NSA's aims and purposes, as stat
ed in the preamble to its constitu
tion, are to:
"Maintain academic freedom;
stimulate and improve democratic
student governments; develop bet
ter educational standards; im
prove student welfare; promote
in t e r n a t i on a I understanding;
guarantee to all people equal
rights and possibilities for educa
tion and foster the recognition of
!!><• rights and responsibilities of
students to the school, the com
munity, humanity and God; and
l<i preserve the interests and in
tegrity of the government and
constitution of the United States
of America."
Practicallv, these aims and pur

poses reduce to the fulfillment of
three functions by NSA:
1. It is a student service organiza
tion.
2. It is the national voice of the
! student in the American educational
[ community.
3. It is the voice of the American
! student community in the interna
[ tional student community.
But the most essential function of
NSA is that each representative can
l stand up and speak for his own
I school, giving each school a voice,
and helping to formulate national
student opinion.
So says Steve Voykovich, national
vice-president of NSA last year and
j graduate of Fordham University.
1 Voykovich is now enrolled in the
I Graduate School of Business at
Stanford.
"Service benefits are second
ary," he avers. "The important
thing is that students in the Unit
ed States have no common meet
ing ground except NSA," and that
it furnishes a place where each
school can have a voice in na
tional student affairs.
Voykovich contrasts the situation
in America with that in Europe,
| where almost every country has a
; ministry of education and the stu
[ dents are bound together strongly
by national organization.
"Students in the U.S. tend to take
| student government for granted and
fail to realize that they have little
i or no voice in matters which con
cern them," he says. "NSA is the
only intercollegiate organization
that can speak for the American
student and fight to safeguard his
' rights."
But how does NSA fulfill these
functions for the American student,
and what good would Stanford get
out of joining NSA?
NSA provides a training ground
for student leaders. It has a stu
dent government information
"i service that would give program
and organizational information to

ASSU committees and clubs.
It provides survey information
gathered from all member colleges
that would be used in revamping
the freshman orientation program
or creating a faculty evaluation
program.
Through ties with European stu
dent organizations, it provides stu
dent tours at reduced rates.
Nationally, NSA policies are often
considered by the U.S. Congress,
the National Education Association,
and the World University Service.
NSA is regarded by such groups as
the American Council on Education
and the U.S. National Commission
for UNESCO as the representative
organ of American students.
Internationally, NSA represents
American students at internation
al student conferences, and "is a
member of the Co-ordinating Sec
retariat of National Unions of
Students, Inter-American Student
Bureau, and the World University
Service.
Stanford should join NSA, Voy
kovich believes, "to provide a voice
for its students and to make that
voice stronger."
"NSA is strong now," he says,
"but not as strong as it could be if
every college in the country were
member."
Of approximately 850 accredited
colleges in the U.S., more than 400
are members of NSA, including
more than one million students out
of the approximate total of 2.5 mil
lion in America.
