# TRIESTE ISSUE
## Yugoslav Consul: We Will Fight 
### HADLEY ROFF Editor, The Daily 
"We sincerely desire to de
velop friendly relations with oth
er countries," Yugoslav Consul
Sinisa Kosutic and Vice-Consul
Miodrag Vitorovic declared in
private conversations with The
Daily in their San Francisco con
sulate Friday.
"But, they added, their faces
growing grim, "we are not going to
give away thousands and thousands
ol our people who live in the Trieste
territory to live under Italian rule."
"That territory is nily

ours," they insisted. "Ethnically,
politically, morally, and commer
cially we have a right to the re
gion."
And, they intimated, they and
their countrymen would be willing
to fight to keep it out of Italian
hands.
"The minute Italian troops enter
the territory, the troops of Yugo
slavia will also enter," the vice-con
sul declared. > •
The consul interrupted to empha
size, "That is our government's of
ficial and last stand."
The two diplomats, tracing the
history of Trieste, said their gov
ernment had, over the years, of
fered a number of compromise
proposals to Italy for settlement
of the issue*
The last, Kosutic said, provided
that, upon the abandonment of Tri
este's international administration,
the Adriatic coastal city should be
turned over to Italian authority
while the surrounding countryside
should be given to Yugoslavia.

Under the proposal, the consul
continued, both governments would
merely supervise their respective
regions, which would, by democratic
balloting, choose their own form
of government.
He said believed his country
was entitled to the hinterland of
the 293-square-mile Trieste ter
ritory because most of the people
living in that region are Slavs or
Croats, ethnically Yugoslav peo
ples.
The city of Trieste itself, he said,
is predominantly Italian and as such
belongs under Italian rule; and
pointed out that the population of
the city considerably tops that of
the rest of the territory.
Aside from ethnical considera
tions, the two officials said there
were other reasons prompting Yu
goslavia's protest to the American-
British decision to abandon Zone A.
1. Fear that the Italians have
not abandoned their "expansion
ists appetite encouraged by the
Fascists."
2. Displeasure that they were
left out of recent international,
conferences which met to decide
the fate of the tiny but trouble
some area.
"Italian imperialism didn't die
with Mussolini," the consul charged.
"Some circles in Rome, including
Premier Pella," he claimed, have
said that occupation of Zone A is
the first step in securing the so
called right to the rest of the terri
tory,, which has been Yugoslav ter
ritory for centuries."
During the last World War, Kosu
tic said, his people "had as one of
their aims the liberation of Trieste
and surrounding territory and the
Yugoslav people living there."
A peaceful settlement, they
hoped, could come from a four
power conference, to include the
United States. Great Britain, Italy,
and Yugoslavia.
As yet neither America nor Brit
ain has made a move toward accept
ing or rejecting the bid for a con
ference, which was first made last
week by Marshal Tito.

said that occupation of Zone A is
the first step in securing the so
called right to the rest of the terri
tory,, which has been Yugoslav ter
ritory for centuries."
During the last World War, Kosu
tic said, his people "had as one of
their aims the liberation of Trieste
and surrounding territory and the
Yugoslav people living there."
A peaceful settlement, they
hoped, could come from a four
power conference, to include the
United States. Great Britain, Italy,
and Yugoslavia.
As yet neither America nor Brit
ain has made a move toward accept
ing or rejecting the bid for a con
ference, which was first made last
week by Marshal Tito.
"We sincerely desire to de
velop friendly relations with oth
er countries," Yugoslav Consul
Sinisa Kosutic and Vice-Consul
Miodrag Vitorovic declared in
private conversations with The
Daily in their San Francisco con
sulate Friday.
"But, they added, their faces
growing grim, "we are not going to
give away thousands and thousands
ol our people who live in the Trieste
territory to live under Italian rule."
"That territory is nily

ours," they insisted. "Ethnically,
politically, morally, and commer
cially we have a right to the re
gion."
And, they intimated, they and
their countrymen would be willing
to fight to keep it out of Italian
hands.
"The minute Italian troops enter
the territory, the troops of Yugo
slavia will also enter," the vice-con
sul declared. > •
The consul interrupted to empha
size, "That is our government's of
ficial and last stand."
The two diplomats, tracing the
history of Trieste, said their gov
ernment had, over the years, of
fered a number of compromise
proposals to Italy for settlement
of the issue*
The last, Kosutic said, provided
that, upon the abandonment of Tri
este's international administration,
the Adriatic coastal city should be
turned over to Italian authority
while the surrounding countryside
should be given to Yugoslavia.

Under the proposal, the consul
continued, both governments would
merely supervise their respective
regions, which would, by democratic
balloting, choose their own form
of government.
He said believed his country
was entitled to the hinterland of
the 293-square-mile Trieste ter
ritory because most of the people
living in that region are Slavs or
Croats, ethnically Yugoslav peo
ples.
The city of Trieste itself, he said,
is predominantly Italian and as such
belongs under Italian rule; and
pointed out that the population of
the city considerably tops that of
the rest of the territory.
Aside from ethnical considera
tions, the two officials said there
were other reasons prompting Yu
goslavia's protest to the American-
British decision to abandon Zone A.
1. Fear that the Italians have
not abandoned their "expansion
ists appetite encouraged by the
Fascists."
2. Displeasure that they were
left out of recent international,
conferences which met to decide
the fate of the tiny but trouble
some area.
"Italian imperialism didn't die
with Mussolini," the consul charged.
"Some circles in Rome, including
Premier Pella," he claimed, have
said that occupation of Zone A is
the first step in securing the so
called right to the rest of the terri
tory,, which has been Yugoslav ter
ritory for centuries."
