### 
BERLIN. Oct. 18 (UP)â€”East Ger
man Communists imposed tiqht
new controls today on railroad traf
fic between East Germany and West
Berlin in an efTort to halt refugees
and anti-Communists fleeing arrest.
Western officials said the checks
were designed to halt the flight of
refugees to the West and catch anti-
Communists fleeing arrest. Some 400
East Germans daily are granted po
litical asylum in West Berlin.
The Communist rail control came
with the publication of "time table
changes (which) go into effect to
day." The announcement did not
say what the changes were but
travelers found that Communist po
lice and soldiers were halting trains
from East Germain at border sta
tions on the outskirts of West Ber
lin and carrying out thorough
checks of passengers' identity pa
pers and baggage.
