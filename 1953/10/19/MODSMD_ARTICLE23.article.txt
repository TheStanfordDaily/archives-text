# 'We Were Lucky,' Says Taylor; Sanders—'They Were Better'
## Stanford 
### RUSS WILKS 
"It's unbelievable that we won," exclaimed a grinning Bill
cheidecker, reserve end, upon entering the rose-scented Stan
3rd locker room, which was a scene of jubilance as all pandemo
ium had broken loose.
Sam Morley, seated on a training table, said that "Garrett was
ie guy that kept us cool. We were awfully excited before and
uring the game, but he calmed us down."
Garrett, who king in the locker room just as he had been

n the field, shrugged off the praise,*
1 guess I was pretty lucky. The
uy.s gave me plenty of protection.
Masters came into the locker
Aim wiping the perspiration from
is brow, stating that "The last four
linutes were the longest four min- I
tes I've ever seen."
"Sanders' team was the best we
ave met. It was fortunate our pass
im game went so well. Had a lot
s luck. We were lucky," remarked j
'buck Taylor, who appeared as if j
e had played 60 minutes.
He added that "We had fine pass- |
lg. Our patterns were run right, j
at rett, Morley, Steinberg played
til. We played a lousy first half.
"We had no reason to be on the
old in the first half. I told them (at
all-time) to pass every time. It 1
as our only hope to pass and pass j
rid pass."
"Cameron looked good. UCLA
as as tough as I expected," said
uylor.
\s far as UCLA's pass defense
v.s concerned, Taylor heralded
larrett and the receivers when he
■marked that "No defensive man
m stop perfectly thrown passes
nd perfectly executed pass pat
;rns." i
There were no serious injuries,
though many of the players
were nursing welts and bruises.
Ernie Horn appeared to be the
worse for wear with a possible
dented rib injury. Ron Cook suf
fered a slightly strained knee,
Harry Smith received a lump on
I he noggin, but outside of a head- j
/lie was in good shape. Jim Tru
lier, John Stewart, and Bill Went- |
worth were also shaken up, hut
were expected to he ready for
Saturday's" tussle with Washing
ton.
Just before appearing before the
Indent body which was clamoring
him, Taylor in a reply to the
uostion, "How would you feel

about playing UCLA next week?"
' jokingly said, "We wouldn't show
! up."
