### BILL WRIGHT 
Hardiman Cureton, UCLA's dynamic sophomore guard, led the
slow parade of beaten Bruins into the dressing room Saturday.
He was dry-eyed—because he'd wiped away the tears.
"It's life," he said. "You either win or lose. And when you
get beat, you get beat by a better team."
Coach Red Sanders didn't have much to say either: "I'm not in
a talking mood."
He continued slowly: "We were just defeated by a team which

richly deserved to win, a team
which did practically everything
better than we did.
"To my mind this was no upset.
The game looked dead even to me,
and I said so in Los Angeles. I
wasn't far off.
"I don't want to take anything
away from Stanford, but I will say
that you didn't see us at our best.
If we don't play better than that,
we'll get beat more often. I think
we've fumbled more per game this
year than we did all last season."
Everybody wanted to know what
he thought of Bob Garrett's pass
ing. Sanders almost winced at the
mention of the Stanford quarter
back. "I've never seen one man
dominate a game as much as Gar
rett did today."
He elaborated: "His performance
beat us. I didn't see him throw one
poor pass; he didn't throw a single
interception.
"They hpve good patterns, good
receivers, and a great passer. I don't
think they showed us anything new,
but we've had trouble with passes
before.
"No, I don't think our defense
was any worse. We think we have'
a fairly good secondary. We used
the same defense as we have had for
four years. And I think we rushed
him pretty well considering that we
dropped our ends back to protect.
Sanders didn't think Paul Cam
eron's absence from the offensive

lineup in the middle of the foiu th
quarter made any difference.
"They were completing passes all
around him, so I decided to use
Milt Davis at safety. After all, we
had to try to keep Stanford from
scoring at any cost.
"And he didn't do much when he
got back in, did he?
"We have no alibis, we have no
excuses, we have no explanations,

we have no rationalizations, we just
got beat."
And Sanders walked out of the
press conference, and the Bruins
went back home.

"They were completing passes all
around him, so I decided to use
Milt Davis at safety. After all, we
had to try to keep Stanford from
scoring at any cost.
"And he didn't do much when he
got back in, did he?
"We have no alibis, we have no
excuses, we have no explanations,

we have no rationalizations, we just
got beat."
And Sanders walked out of the
press conference, and the Bruins
went back home.
Hardiman Cureton, UCLA's dynamic sophomore guard, led the
slow parade of beaten Bruins into the dressing room Saturday.
He was dry-eyed—because he'd wiped away the tears.
"It's life," he said. "You either win or lose. And when you
get beat, you get beat by a better team."
Coach Red Sanders didn't have much to say either: "I'm not in
a talking mood."
He continued slowly: "We were just defeated by a team which

richly deserved to win, a team
which did practically everything
better than we did.
"To my mind this was no upset.
The game looked dead even to me,
and I said so in Los Angeles. I
wasn't far off.
"I don't want to take anything
away from Stanford, but I will say
that you didn't see us at our best.
If we don't play better than that,
we'll get beat more often. I think
we've fumbled more per game this
year than we did all last season."
Everybody wanted to know what
he thought of Bob Garrett's pass
ing. Sanders almost winced at the
mention of the Stanford quarter
back. "I've never seen one man
dominate a game as much as Gar
rett did today."
He elaborated: "His performance
beat us. I didn't see him throw one
poor pass; he didn't throw a single
interception.
"They hpve good patterns, good
receivers, and a great passer. I don't
think they showed us anything new,
but we've had trouble with passes
before.
"No, I don't think our defense
was any worse. We think we have'
a fairly good secondary. We used
the same defense as we have had for
four years. And I think we rushed
him pretty well considering that we
dropped our ends back to protect.
Sanders didn't think Paul Cam
eron's absence from the offensive

lineup in the middle of the foiu th
quarter made any difference.
