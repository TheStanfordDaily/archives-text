Stanford's Braves added a third
win to their impressive perfect rec
ord last, Friday afternoon by down
ing MofTett Field, 13-0. The game
was played at MofTett Field.
The Braves' first touchdown came
in the second quarter when quar
terback Jerry Gustafson faded back,
spotted end Jim McCamant far
down the field, and hit him with a
long pass. The play covered 35
yards. Don Day, who played an out
standing game at fullback all af
ternoon both in rushing and on de
fense, hit the center of the MofTett
Field line to score the other TD in
the second half.
Dave Castellucci was largely re
sponsible for keeping play deep in
MofTett Field's territory throughout
much of the game with his spark
ling ptinting, when the Braves' de
fense faltered. Guard Tony Mosich
and center A! Robertson also turned
in good games in the forward wall.
