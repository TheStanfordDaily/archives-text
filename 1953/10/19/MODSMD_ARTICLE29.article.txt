# Card Water Polo Team Overpowers UCLA 13-6
## 
### 
Leading all the way, the Stanford
water polo team continued its un
beaten path to the Pacific Coast
championships last Saturday morn
ing by defeating the UCLA Bruins,
13-6, here in the men's pool, before
25U spectators.
Flush from their comeback 4-3
victory over Cal two weeks ago, the
locals were expected to be "down"
for this one, while the Uclans were
due to put up their best game so
far this season after beating their
cross-town neighbors, the Trojans,
10-7.
Two minutes into the match, Irvin
Johnson rammed in his first of five
goals on a backhand shot six feet
out. Then the Bruins' offense, Bob
Zirkie, retaliated v/Hli another back
hand.
That was the end of the Bruin
point'making for the next four min
utes, which saw the Indians ram
through four more goals, two each
by Johnson and Jim Gaughran, be
fore Zirkie added two mote jump !
shots for a 5-3 quarter score.
In the second stanza, the Cards i
continued their pin - point passing 1

and scoring by racking up five more
goals, two each by Jim Lee and
Gaughran, one by Johnson.
The Bruins always threatened,
but were continually thwarted by
goalie Dave Merton's seemingly un
canny screening of the goal net.
After a 10-3 intermission, Coach
Tom Haynie inserted reserves into
the forward positions in place of the
starting three.
The Bruins held the new scoring
trio scoreless and went on to score
a goal on layout shot.
Three minutes into the fourth
quarter, after scoring one more
point, Johnson fouled out along with
Johnny Schmidt.
