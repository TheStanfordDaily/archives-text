### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 18 (UP)â€”Jolting
Joe Perry, the Natoinal Football
League's leading ground gainer,
crashed to three touchdowns today
as the San Francisco 49ers overcame
a 21-point deficit and beat the Chi
cago Bears, 35 to 28, before 40,740
fans who booed the home team
roundly.
It was the 49ers' third victory in
four games and tied them with Los
Angeles and Detroit for first place
in the Western Division.
Perry, in his fifth year in the
league, carried the ball 20 times and
gained 117 yards to increase his
rushing total for the year to 343
yards, in 61 carries. He crashed 51
yards through the center of the Bear
line for one tally and scored the
others on plunges of three and two
yards.
Perry's second touchdown was set
up when Jim Powers ran a blocked
field goal attempt from the 31-yard
line to the Bears' 14 while the third
tally followed a fumble by Billy
Stone recovered by Clay Matthewy
on the Bears' 13.
The 49ers might have won by a
bigger margin but for two misplays
by Perry.
