JERUSALEM, Oct. 18 (UP)â€”An
aroused Jordan rushed Arab Le
gionnaires to the Israeli frontier to
day and asked Iraq for additional
military aid as both Jordan and Is
rael prepared to argue the explosive
border situation before the United
Nations Security Council.
The Israeli cabinet met in emer
gency session and prepared to coun
ter Jordan's charges of aggression
with complaints of its own over
Jordan's "lawless acts" which it said
have been going on since the ar
mistice was reached in 1950.
Meanwhile, the United States, in
one of the sharpest rebuffs ever
handed the new Jewish state of Is
ral, today demanded stern punish
ment for Israeli forces which at
tacked an Arab village in Jordan.
It also urged that measures be
taken to prevent a repetition of the
Jewish raid Wednesday in which 66
persons were reported killed and
nine wounded.
The. statement was issued on the
eve of an emergency meeting of the
United Nations Security Council to
day to deal with rising tensions be
tween Israel and her Arab neigh
bors.
