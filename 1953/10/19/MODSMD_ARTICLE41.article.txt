WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 (UP) â€”
Chairman W. Sterling Cole of the
Congressional Atomic Energy Com
mittee said today any idea that
atomic weapons won't be used in
the next war probably is "wishful
thinking."
He called for creation of an atom
ic stockpile big enough to destroy
completely any aggressor and a fur
ther build-up of this country's con
tinental air defenses. He said four

out of five enemy bombers now
would reach their targets.
