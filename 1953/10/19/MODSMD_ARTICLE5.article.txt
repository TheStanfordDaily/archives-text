MUNSAN. Monday, Oct. 19 (UP)
â€”The Neutral Nations Repatriation
Commission yesterday called off ef
forts of Red agents to persuade
anti-Communist prisoners to return
home, apparently because of a dis
agreement with the Reds.
The NNRC suspended today's
talks when the Communists de
manded interviews with the North
Koreans instead of the Chinese pris
oners the commission was prepared
to deliver.
