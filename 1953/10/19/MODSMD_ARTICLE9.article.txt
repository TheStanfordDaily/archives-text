# ROSE BOWL EXPRESS CHANGES ENGINES
## Garrett Scalps Bruins, 21-20 
### PHIL BERMAN 
The UCLA Rose Bowl express was derailed emphatically in the
Stadium Saturday as a spectacular bunch of Stanford Indian*;
came from behind to defeat the Bruins 21 to 20.
The stunning victory, which certainly must be ranked as one
of the great moments in Stanford sports history, put the Cards
into the lead on the Rose Bowl track, as they now have recorded
three wins in three starts in conference play.
Providing the impetus that upended the supposedly "unbeat
able" Bruins, who seemed to be tripping over their press clippings
most of the afternoon, was Stanford guarterback Bob Garrett, who
engineered one of the mosi outstanding offensive games it has
ever been this reporter's privilege to witness.
It was Garrett who completed 18 of 27 passes, everyone a
beauty, for 196 yards; it was Garrett who passed for the three
touchdowns the Indians scored; it was Garrett who recovered
Cameron's fumble on the opening kickoff to set up the first
Stanford touchdown; it was Garrett who intercepted the pass to
thwart another UCLA drive in the second period; it was Garrett
who kicked the three extra points that gave the Cards their
margin of victory.
Definitely it was a great individual triumph for Bob, who now
ranks well up statistically among the nation's leading collegiate
passers, but it was also a glorious win for Coach Chuck Taylo;
and the rest of the Indians, who have come a long way from thai
disastrous opener against COP.
For example, Sam Morley and John Steinberg proved to be two
of the finest offensive ends that could possibly be found on any
football field.
Truly outstanding in the line were Matt Armitage, Phil Wilson,
Jerry Goldberg, Norm Manoogian, Ray Krickeberg, Barry Smith,
while Bill Wentworth, Jarvis Watson, and Bill Tarr among the
backfield men helped to provide Garrett with the protective cone
he needed to get his aerials off.
And let's not forget little A 1 Napoleon from Hawaii, who cam<■
to the Farm via Pasadena City College, and had, up to last week,
been relegated to the junior Varsity because he couldn't play
defense.
It's old stuff now. but for the record this is how the touchdown *
were recorded Saturday.
1. Giving an indication of what was lo come, the Indian:;
scored the game's first touchdown after three minutes of piny
when they drove 35 yards after Garrett recovered Cameron':,
fumble on the opening kickoff. Garrett passed six yards to finn
Cook for the TD and Bob converted.
2. UCLA got on the scoreboard late in the period when Cameron
tossed a 47-yard pass to Bill Stits. Pete Dailey missed the con
version.
3. The Bruins went ahead early in the second quarter whotk
Cameron went over from four yards out and Dailey converted.
4. UCLA opened it up to 20 to 7 early in the third quarter when
they recovered a Stanford fumble, and drove to paydirt with Cam
eron scoring from the two-yard line.
5. The Indians closed the gap to 20 to 14 late in the third period
when Garrett passed nine yards to Morley.
6. The winning touchdown came early in the fourth quarter
when Garrett threw a six-yard pass to A 1 Napoleon and Bob
kicked the vital extra point.
Let's see now, great Stanford football games: Cal in '24, Cal in
'47, Cal in '50, USC in '51, and now UCLA in '53.
Yes, it fits.

football field.
Truly outstanding in the line were Matt Armitage, Phil Wilson,
Jerry Goldberg, Norm Manoogian, Ray Krickeberg, Barry Smith,
while Bill Wentworth, Jarvis Watson, and Bill Tarr among the
backfield men helped to provide Garrett with the protective cone
he needed to get his aerials off.
And let's not forget little A 1 Napoleon from Hawaii, who cam<■
to the Farm via Pasadena City College, and had, up to last week,
been relegated to the junior Varsity because he couldn't play
defense.
It's old stuff now. but for the record this is how the touchdown *
were recorded Saturday.
1. Giving an indication of what was lo come, the Indian:;
scored the game's first touchdown after three minutes of piny
when they drove 35 yards after Garrett recovered Cameron':,
fumble on the opening kickoff. Garrett passed six yards to finn
Cook for the TD and Bob converted.
2. UCLA got on the scoreboard late in the period when Cameron
tossed a 47-yard pass to Bill Stits. Pete Dailey missed the con
version.
3. The Bruins went ahead early in the second quarter whotk
Cameron went over from four yards out and Dailey converted.
4. UCLA opened it up to 20 to 7 early in the third quarter when
they recovered a Stanford fumble, and drove to paydirt with Cam
eron scoring from the two-yard line.
5. The Indians closed the gap to 20 to 14 late in the third period
when Garrett passed nine yards to Morley.
6. The winning touchdown came early in the fourth quarter
when Garrett threw a six-yard pass to A 1 Napoleon and Bob
kicked the vital extra point.
Let's see now, great Stanford football games: Cal in '24, Cal in
'47, Cal in '50, USC in '51, and now UCLA in '53.
Yes, it fits.

The UCLA Rose Bowl express was derailed emphatically in the
Stadium Saturday as a spectacular bunch of Stanford Indian*;
came from behind to defeat the Bruins 21 to 20.
The stunning victory, which certainly must be ranked as one
of the great moments in Stanford sports history, put the Cards
into the lead on the Rose Bowl track, as they now have recorded
three wins in three starts in conference play.
Providing the impetus that upended the supposedly "unbeat
able" Bruins, who seemed to be tripping over their press clippings
most of the afternoon, was Stanford guarterback Bob Garrett, who
engineered one of the mosi outstanding offensive games it has
ever been this reporter's privilege to witness.
It was Garrett who completed 18 of 27 passes, everyone a
beauty, for 196 yards; it was Garrett who passed for the three
touchdowns the Indians scored; it was Garrett who recovered
Cameron's fumble on the opening kickoff to set up the first
Stanford touchdown; it was Garrett who intercepted the pass to
thwart another UCLA drive in the second period; it was Garrett
who kicked the three extra points that gave the Cards their
margin of victory.
Definitely it was a great individual triumph for Bob, who now
ranks well up statistically among the nation's leading collegiate
passers, but it was also a glorious win for Coach Chuck Taylo;
and the rest of the Indians, who have come a long way from thai
disastrous opener against COP.
For example, Sam Morley and John Steinberg proved to be two
of the finest offensive ends that could possibly be found on any
football field.
Truly outstanding in the line were Matt Armitage, Phil Wilson,
Jerry Goldberg, Norm Manoogian, Ray Krickeberg, Barry Smith,
while Bill Wentworth, Jarvis Watson, and Bill Tarr among the

top picture Tarr is trying to evade a Uclan defender on a jaunt
around end in the third quarter.
