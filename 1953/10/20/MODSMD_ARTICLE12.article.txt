WASHINGTON, Oct. 19 (UP)
Defense Secretary Charles E. Wil
son said today the nation's growing
arsenal of atomic and other ir w
weapons eventually should permit
a "substantial reduction in the
number ol U.S. troops in Europe.
Wilson also ruled out .-ending an
other armored division to Europe
next year. He said he doivs not think
it is needed and that "otlu r things"
will be done to bolster European
defenses, such as the recent ship
ment of atomic cannon.
He hinted that the Unite ! State s
might rely more on air power than
on ground forces in Europe. He said
it remains to be "worked out wheth
er we take our load in air power or
ground troops."
Wilson told a news conference
that any reduction in U.S. forces in
Europe would be carried out over
"a reasonable period of time" and
emphasized that no men will be
brought home "tomorrow morning."
The United States now has the
equivalent of six divisions in Eu
rope.
