# The 						Skepticism Fades
## 
### 
Many of us were skeptical last Wednesday.
We remembered the stories of the last attempt
at a Political Union at C-tdnford and how it had
We were aware of the extreme impor
tance of a successful Union to the Stanford
community, and we were hopeful. We were
aware also of the cliches about "student apa
thy' and "Ivory Tower," and we were fearful.
The skepticism and the fear didn't last. As
the first meeting of the new Stanford Political
Union progressed, we saw indications that the
fundamental ideals and purposes of the Union
would be fulfilled.
A basic attitude was set at that meeting.
Throughout the discussion and debate, we
were aware that the membership was affirm
ing one ol the premises expressed by the
students who had prepared the Union's con
stitution. It was the expression of the ideal
that the Union would remain primarily an
educational group, that its party groups
would present their speakers and views for
the purpose of informing, not for practice in
political manipulation.
The election of the Union's officers expres

sed the high level of fair leadership which the
members demanded. The officers were chosen
with a faith and a confidence that a large inde
pendent group would be encouraged to par
ticipate in the Union's meetings. The party
groups would be strong, but they would not be
the controlling influence.
And the attendance was good. Not only was
the group large in number, but it was also high
in spirit. The discussion was vigorous and
strong, and a mood of sincerity and enthusiasm
prevailed as subjects were presented, debated,
and resolved.
We think the first meeting of Stanford's new
Political Union was a success. For the first
time in many years, students were able to
hear the expression of conflicting political at
titudes. The ideals previously expressed only
in the words of the Union's planners have be
gun to crystalize. The fulfillment of those ideals
has not yet been reached, but many of us are
now hopeful and confident that it won't be long
before Stanford has a strong and permanent
political union.

Many of us were skeptical last Wednesday.
We remembered the stories of the last attempt
at a Political Union at C-tdnford and how it had
We were aware of the extreme impor
tance of a successful Union to the Stanford
community, and we were hopeful. We were
aware also of the cliches about "student apa
thy' and "Ivory Tower," and we were fearful.
The skepticism and the fear didn't last. As
the first meeting of the new Stanford Political
Union progressed, we saw indications that the
fundamental ideals and purposes of the Union
would be fulfilled.
A basic attitude was set at that meeting.
Throughout the discussion and debate, we
were aware that the membership was affirm
ing one ol the premises expressed by the
students who had prepared the Union's con
stitution. It was the expression of the ideal
that the Union would remain primarily an
educational group, that its party groups
would present their speakers and views for
the purpose of informing, not for practice in
political manipulation.
The election of the Union's officers expres

sed the high level of fair leadership which the
members demanded. The officers were chosen
with a faith and a confidence that a large inde
pendent group would be encouraged to par
ticipate in the Union's meetings. The party
groups would be strong, but they would not be
the controlling influence.
And the attendance was good. Not only was
the group large in number, but it was also high
in spirit. The discussion was vigorous and
strong, and a mood of sincerity and enthusiasm
prevailed as subjects were presented, debated,
and resolved.
We think the first meeting of Stanford's new
Political Union was a success. For the first
time in many years, students were able to
hear the expression of conflicting political at
titudes. The ideals previously expressed only
in the words of the Union's planners have be
gun to crystalize. The fulfillment of those ideals
has not yet been reached, but many of us are
now hopeful and confident that it won't be long
before Stanford has a strong and permanent
political union.
