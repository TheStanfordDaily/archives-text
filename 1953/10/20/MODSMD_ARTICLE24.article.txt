### DICK MANSFIELD 
Today's lecture will devote itself to the identifica
tion and classification of lecturers. Not jUst Civ lec
turers, either, kiddies. All sorts of lecturers, in
cluding Tuesday Evening Sewes lecturers and your
K.A., deserve recognition of one sort or another.
Therefore, let us consider that, first of all, we can
not call the Story-teller type of lecturer a class

apart. For all lecturers tell sto
ries. We can arrive at some dif
ferentiation by observing what
kind of stories they tell. There
are three types of Story-tellers
for Lecturers, if you wish), and
they tell, fascinatingly enough,
three types of stories:
1. "Well, it seems there were
these two Irishmen . . ."
This category includes gym
teachers (male), middle-aged

professors of the self-satisfied type, and neo
phyte English teachers.
2. "Which reminds me of a droll anecdote, which
may not strike you as humorous, but . . ."
This type of lecturer has heard that it pays to
start ofl a lecture with a light comment or two.
Brace yourselves.
3. "When I was a boy on the farm . . ."
One who righteously decries the new generation
as mental midgets all, and unfit to eat nails as
their fathers did. This kind of story goes on and
on, and consumes half the period.
Separate categories deal with the orator's style:
1. The gymnast: Bounces from one foot to the other,
pounds the rostrum, gesticulates wildly at peril to

those in the front row, mops brow repeatedly,
gets all frazzled.
2. The golden-longued droner: Not a bird, but rath
er a bloviator. "In these, the golden days of that
far-famed citadel, Marcus Gaius Migoonus betook
him to the banks of that stately Tiber, to . .
and so on.
3.•The foghorn: Speaking to a small group of drag
onfly fanciers in the Little Room (12 It. by 12 ft.),
he brings his Mem Aud adenoids and bellows the
whole address at the top of his lungs. This is
why the public address system sometimes wails
like a melancholy hound. Perhaps the Foghorn
doesn't believe in electronics. Favorite line: "Can
you hear me back there?"
4. The reverse: Murmurs very, very softly. Coinci
• dence: This type seldom uses a prepared script.
or notes. Hypothesis: Perhaps he is not mur
muring at all. Perhaps he is snoring.
5. Punster: Can't, lecture on ancient peoples without
pun-ishing the madding crowd thus: "What was
the chief export of ancient Phoenicia? Phoenician
blinds!" Paiise to glance modestly down. Shy
glance at balcony. Little cough. Utter silence
from the assembled scholars. Proving that the
modern generation (cf. I—3 above) isn't as dumb
as it looks.
fi. Frank Buck (Bring 'em back alive): "Now, this
is a dull subject, but I'm going to try to make it
so interesting that no one, I said no one, will go
to sleep!"
And that's how it is. The Intercollegiate Chowder-
Swilling Lecturer-Watchers' Association will appre
ciate field notes.
