# CAMPUS OPINION
## Thanks, Stanford 
### 
To the Editor:
After a wonderful 10,000-mile trip across the con
tinent and an equally nice sea voyage to Italy I am
home again in Germany. Things are different here
from California: our houses are old and narrow, our
cars are small, and people are ? till somewhat con
servative in their ideas and their actions.
It is hard to get used to such a change. But my
country is still beautiful and a lot of reconstruction
was done while I was away. Besides that I still can
think bock -and I often do- of Stanford and the
paradisiac time which I enjoyed there.
During the year I was in the States I could of
course not get a complete picture of America; but
while I lived with you 1 got at least familiar with

some aspects of American life (don't laugh, I do not
only think of Rossotti's). I found out that the young
Americans have basically the same desires as the j
young people in Old Europe: the longing for peace j
among the nations, a harmonic family life, and a
bettej, and freer living for the individual.
My year at Stanford was the most interesting of
my life. Thinks to my teachers, to the administra
tion, to the three houses I had the pleasure to live in,
and thanks to everybody who helped through his
hospitality to make my time at Stanford so wonder
ful.
