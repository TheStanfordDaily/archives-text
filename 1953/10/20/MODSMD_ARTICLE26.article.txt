To the Editor:
Let's ask our professors to help us cut down on
some of the paper work for our courses. In other
words, let's ask our professors to consider the fol
lowing suggestions:
1. "New" textbooks (not now printed):
a) At the beginning of every chapter have a mul
tiple-choice vocabulary test covering all new
technical words to be used in the chapter. An
swers on same page.
IÂ») A.s these specific words come up in the text,
italicize them and underline their definitions.
4
i ) Al the end of the chapter have a write-in vo
cabulary test. Answers there.
d) At the end of several chapters have a review

multiple-choice and write-in vocabulary test.
Answers there.
e) In addition, incorporate into the book a flash
card printing ( t on both sides of the paper) of
.-ill the important principles and especially diffi
cult. words in the book. (Main principles of
basket weaving, on one stele; (1) Get straw. (2)
Cut straw. (3) Etc., on other side.) The stu
dent may clip out the cards (sections, 2 in. by
4 in. or so, of sheet of paper) a.s they are
needed. The first sheet will cover the First five
pages or so, etc.
"Old textbooks (printed now): Mimeograph sheets
of pre-chapter and post-chapter and review word
tests, and sheets of flash cards for 1 sale to students.
