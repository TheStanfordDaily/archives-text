# NSA Gives Students National Voice
##

(Ed. note: Tomorrow night Ex- |
com will discuss and possibly act
upon a suggestion that Stanford
become a member of the National
Student Association. This is the
second in a series of three informa
tive articles which attempt to an
swer such questions as "What is
NSA?" and "What good can NSA
do for Stanford?" The last article
will appear tomorrow.)

As an independent organiza
tion, the National Student As
sociation is not strong. But a
strong membership, and thus a
strong voice, would provide a
strength by -which students
could participate effectively in
public affairs.
Because of the nature of the as
sociation, a loose federation of in
dependent student bodies, it does
not participate directly in public af
fairs, and NSA officers will empha
size that it is not a lobbying organi
zation.
Rather, it has an indirect power
through making' its stands and
resolutions known to actual legis
lative bodies.
For example, NSA's National Con
gress this year passed a resolution
that students working their way
through college should have all tui
tion expenses tax-exempt.
The congress further directed that
the resolution be brought to the
attention of a commission that might
take action on it.
Thus the resolution was handed to
Representative Daniel Reed, chair
man of the House Ways and Means
Committee, and a Congressional bill
containing this resolution was form
ulated. The bill is now in committee
waiting Congressional action in Jan
uary.
In this way, through NSA, Stan

ford could make its ideas and opin
ions heard and participate actively
in public affairs.
Bui. since NSA is an aggregate
of student governments, member
student bodies must insure that af
filiation with NSA will be active
and meaningful. At Stanford it
would work this way:
ASSU Excom would assume re
sponsibility for the satisfactory func
tioning of affiliation, and an active
participation in the conferences, pro- j
grams, and projects offered by NSA. ]
The bulk of the responsibility
would fall on the ASSU president,
who would head the Stanford dele
gations to "all NSA meetings, both
national and regional. He Xvould in
sure that Excom:
1. Approved NSA recommended
programs for implementation on
the campus.
2. Accredited representatives of
Stanford to NSA regional and na
tional meetings.
Selected the personnel to di
rect liaison with NSA regional and
national offices, preferably from
among the members of the student
government.
The ASSU president would ap
point an NSA coordinator who would
see that NSA programs were imple
mented, and serve as a resource and
information assistant in all activi
ties of student government and stu
dent activities.
At Stanford NSA could give clubs
information and help with programs
and organization; supplement such
functions as the Foreign Scholar pro
gram; give Excom assistance in ad
ministrative problems; arrange stu
dent tours at reduced rates; gather
survey information for use in fac
ulty evaluation programs and im
proving student-faculty relations.
NSA officials point out that the
association is flexible, adapting it
self to the needs of each individual
.school. Also, member schools are not

bound by NSA policies and resolu
tions, and student I'overnments may
approve them or not as they see fit.
ine NSA stall also publishes minor
ity stands taken by dissenting
schools.
They also stress that NSA is a
non-sectarian organi
zation and is careful not to get in
volved in partisan politics; that it is
a student government on a national
scale.
