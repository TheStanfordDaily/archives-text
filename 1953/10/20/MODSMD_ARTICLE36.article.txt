# PUNTS AND PITCHES
## A 						Dispassionate Discussion 
### Pete Grothe 
Now that some of the nectar and ambrosia of last Saturday's triumph
has worn off, this would be an appropriate time to try to discuss the game
and football things to come dispassionately. If this can oe done. It's a
tough chore to be cool and dispassionate about Saturday's sizzler.
One of the main reasons why I can't be dispassionate is that Major

Hoople and I were the only sportswriters in the country
to pick a Stanford win. Parenthetically, I was the only
sports writer in the country last year to predict Stan
ford over USC. Stanford lost that one, 54 to 7.
Joe Ruetz said last week, "It will take Stanford's best
game to beat UCLA. We'll even have to play better
than in the first half against Illinois." The Indians
played their best game last Saturday, in the second
half, at any rate, and topped the strongest team in the
conference.
But the Indians will have to keep improving if they
want to go to the Rose Bowl. Three giant-killers,

VVCtJtI IW gvy IU UIC iiuot iJUYYi. 11I1CC I I |\ Hlt I
Washington, USC. and Cal. all undefeated in PCC play, stand in the way.
To vanquish those three, the Indians will have to improve the quality of
their blocking and tackling.
Make no mistake about it, Stanford CAN go to the Rose Bowl, although
I'd rather beat Cal this year than go to a hundred Rose Bowls, And Stan
word WILL go to the Rose Bowl if it continues its current rate of im
provement—a rate of improvement that found a team that couldn't beat
C.O.P. in the first game topping one of the nation's five best squads four
weeks later.

Hul Tackling Musi Improve
But the tackling and blocking must improve. The tackling in the first
hall oi the Bruin game was frankly weak. Cameron and Davenport were ;
slithering off arm tackles one after another for extra yardage. Tackling j
became inspired in the second half, and boys like Tanner. Manoogian, and
(iant were' throwing their shoulders into UCLA runners like tacklers '
should. Also, the momentum precipitated by Garrett's uncanny accuracy,
prodded the blockers to be sharp on pass protection in the second half
They had it easy, because the Bruins were sending in only four men
against the passer, but nevertheless boys like Bill Tarr were blocking hard
and well.
But rather than think in terms of the Rose Bowl, let's think in terms of
each game as it comes up and let the Rose Bowl take care of itself. And
this week it's Washington in Seattle, and Washington in Seattle is about
10 percent tougher than it is in opposition territory. The skies have a
habit of crying up in the great Northwest during football segson, and Wash
ington is much more used to the muddy going than Stanford. Also, a
strong downpour could do fearful things to Stanford's passing attack, of
which there is no better.
Huskies Resemble Indians
The Huskies have a team similar to Stanford's. Washington, like Stan
lord. has a great passing quarterback in Sandy Lederman, the Santa Monica
.soph. Washington, like Stanford, has improved vastly since the beginning of
the season (They tied USC, 13 to 13. two weeks ago and emphaticaUy out
played them.) And Washington, like Stanford, lacks depth.
We conclude this column with hearty congratulations to (1) Bobby Gar
rett who turned in the most electrifying passing performance we've ever '
seen; (2) Sam Morley and Mantis Steinberg who grabbed balls out of the
ether in the midst of forests of defenders; (3) Joe Ruetz who brilliantly
scouted the Bruins and discovered their one weakness—an inability to
defend against ends who go out and then cut in or buttonhook—so Stan
ford spread its ends and set a flanker out; (4) to a team whose offense !
clicked for three touchdowns in one game against an opponent who had
only allowed one score in four games against strong competition; (5) and
to a team which pulled itself up by the bootstraps and scored 14 climactic
points to overcome a 13-point lead.
Also, a special orchid to Ernie Dorn, the scrappy scooter from the Mid
west. who incurred (1) a swollen jaw. (2) a bruised cheek, (3) a sprained
ankle, (4) a charley horse, and (5) a dented rib.
He will start in the Washington game.

They had it easy, because the Bruins were sending in only four men
against the passer, but nevertheless boys like Bill Tarr were blocking hard
and well.
But rather than think in terms of the Rose Bowl, let's think in terms of
each game as it comes up and let the Rose Bowl take care of itself. And
this week it's Washington in Seattle, and Washington in Seattle is about
10 percent tougher than it is in opposition territory. The skies have a
habit of crying up in the great Northwest during football segson, and Wash
ington is much more used to the muddy going than Stanford. Also, a
strong downpour could do fearful things to Stanford's passing attack, of
which there is no better.
Huskies Resemble Indians
The Huskies have a team similar to Stanford's. Washington, like Stan
lord. has a great passing quarterback in Sandy Lederman, the Santa Monica
.soph. Washington, like Stanford, has improved vastly since the beginning of
the season (They tied USC, 13 to 13. two weeks ago and emphaticaUy out
played them.) And Washington, like Stanford, lacks depth.
We conclude this column with hearty congratulations to (1) Bobby Gar
rett who turned in the most electrifying passing performance we've ever '
seen; (2) Sam Morley and Mantis Steinberg who grabbed balls out of the
ether in the midst of forests of defenders; (3) Joe Ruetz who brilliantly
scouted the Bruins and discovered their one weakness—an inability to
defend against ends who go out and then cut in or buttonhook—so Stan
ford spread its ends and set a flanker out; (4) to a team whose offense !
clicked for three touchdowns in one game against an opponent who had
only allowed one score in four games against strong competition; (5) and
to a team which pulled itself up by the bootstraps and scored 14 climactic
points to overcome a 13-point lead.
Also, a special orchid to Ernie Dorn, the scrappy scooter from the Mid
west. who incurred (1) a swollen jaw. (2) a bruised cheek, (3) a sprained
ankle, (4) a charley horse, and (5) a dented rib.
He will start in the Washington game.

Now that some of the nectar and ambrosia of last Saturday's triumph
has worn off, this would be an appropriate time to try to discuss the game
and football things to come dispassionately. If this can oe done. It's a
tough chore to be cool and dispassionate about Saturday's sizzler.
One of the main reasons why I can't be dispassionate is that Major

Hoople and I were the only sportswriters in the country
to pick a Stanford win. Parenthetically, I was the only
sports writer in the country last year to predict Stan
ford over USC. Stanford lost that one, 54 to 7.
Joe Ruetz said last week, "It will take Stanford's best
game to beat UCLA. We'll even have to play better
than in the first half against Illinois." The Indians
played their best game last Saturday, in the second
half, at any rate, and topped the strongest team in the
conference.
But the Indians will have to keep improving if they
want to go to the Rose Bowl. Three giant-killers,

VVCtJtI IW gvy IU UIC iiuot iJUYYi. 11I1CC I I |\ Hlt I
Washington, USC. and Cal. all undefeated in PCC play, stand in the way.
To vanquish those three, the Indians will have to improve the quality of
their blocking and tackling.
Make no mistake about it, Stanford CAN go to the Rose Bowl, although
I'd rather beat Cal this year than go to a hundred Rose Bowls, And Stan
word WILL go to the Rose Bowl if it continues its current rate of im
provement—a rate of improvement that found a team that couldn't beat
C.O.P. in the first game topping one of the nation's five best squads four
weeks later.

Hul Tackling Musi Improve
But the tackling and blocking must improve. The tackling in the first
hall oi the Bruin game was frankly weak. Cameron and Davenport were ;
slithering off arm tackles one after another for extra yardage. Tackling j
became inspired in the second half, and boys like Tanner. Manoogian, and
(iant were' throwing their shoulders into UCLA runners like tacklers '
should. Also, the momentum precipitated by Garrett's uncanny accuracy,
prodded the blockers to be sharp on pass protection in the second half
They had it easy, because the Bruins were sending in only four men

has worn off, this would be an appropriate time to try to discuss the game
and football things to come dispassionately. If this can oe done. It's a
tough chore to be cool and dispassionate about Saturday's sizzler.
One of the main reasons why I can't be dispassionate is that Major

Hoople and I were the only sportswriters in the country
to pick a Stanford win. Parenthetically, I was the only
sports writer in the country last year to predict Stan
ford over USC. Stanford lost that one, 54 to 7.
Joe Ruetz said last week, "It will take Stanford's best
game to beat UCLA. We'll even have to play better
than in the first half against Illinois." The Indians
played their best game last Saturday, in the second
half, at any rate, and topped the strongest team in the
conference.
But the Indians will have to keep improving if they
want to go to the Rose Bowl. Three giant-killers,

VVCtJtI IW gvy IU UIC iiuot iJUYYi. 11I1CC I I |\ Hlt I
Washington, USC. and Cal. all undefeated in PCC play, stand in the way.
To vanquish those three, the Indians will have to improve the quality of
their blocking and tackling.
Make no mistake about it, Stanford CAN go to the Rose Bowl, although
I'd rather beat Cal this year than go to a hundred Rose Bowls, And Stan
word WILL go to the Rose Bowl if it continues its current rate of im
provement—a rate of improvement that found a team that couldn't beat
C.O.P. in the first game topping one of the nation's five best squads four
weeks later.

Hul Tackling Musi Improve
But the tackling and blocking must improve. The tackling in the first
hall oi the Bruin game was frankly weak. Cameron and Davenport were ;
slithering off arm tackles one after another for extra yardage. Tackling j
became inspired in the second half, and boys like Tanner. Manoogian, and
(iant were' throwing their shoulders into UCLA runners like tacklers '
should. Also, the momentum precipitated by Garrett's uncanny accuracy,
prodded the blockers to be sharp on pass protection in the second half
They had it easy, because the Bruins were sending in only four men
against the passer, but nevertheless boys like Bill Tarr were blocking hard
and well.
But rather than think in terms of the Rose Bowl, let's think in terms of
each game as it comes up and let the Rose Bowl take care of itself. And
this week it's Washington in Seattle, and Washington in Seattle is about
10 percent tougher than it is in opposition territory. The skies have a
habit of crying up in the great Northwest during football segson, and Wash
ington is much more used to the muddy going than Stanford. Also, a
strong downpour could do fearful things to Stanford's passing attack, of
which there is no better.
Huskies Resemble Indians
The Huskies have a team similar to Stanford's. Washington, like Stan
lord. has a great passing quarterback in Sandy Lederman, the Santa Monica
.soph. Washington, like Stanford, has improved vastly since the beginning of
the season (They tied USC, 13 to 13. two weeks ago and emphaticaUy out
played them.) And Washington, like Stanford, lacks depth.
We conclude this column with hearty congratulations to (1) Bobby Gar
rett who turned in the most electrifying passing performance we've ever '
seen; (2) Sam Morley and Mantis Steinberg who grabbed balls out of the
ether in the midst of forests of defenders; (3) Joe Ruetz who brilliantly
scouted the Bruins and discovered their one weakness—an inability to
defend against ends who go out and then cut in or buttonhook—so Stan
ford spread its ends and set a flanker out; (4) to a team whose offense !
clicked for three touchdowns in one game against an opponent who had
only allowed one score in four games against strong competition; (5) and
to a team which pulled itself up by the bootstraps and scored 14 climactic
points to overcome a 13-point lead.
Also, a special orchid to Ernie Dorn, the scrappy scooter from the Mid
west. who incurred (1) a swollen jaw. (2) a bruised cheek, (3) a sprained
ankle, (4) a charley horse, and (5) a dented rib.
He will start in the Washington game.
