# Taylor Fails to Predict Victory Over Washington
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 19 (UP)—The Stanford University foot
ball team that knocked UCLA from the ranks of the unbeaten on
Saturday still doesn't belong on the same field with the Bruins,
Coach Chuck Taylor of the Indians said today.
"I not only Wouldn't want to play UCLA again," said Taylor,

"but I don't even want to go near*
them."
The next foe for the new "Cin- j
derella team" of the Pacific Coast
Conference is University of Wash- j
ington. But Taylor doesn't know [
what to expect from the Huskies, j
He won't even predict a victory for |
his team—which is unusual for this

ever-optimistic coach.
But getting back to the UCLA I
game, he said:
"Our Bob Garrett just got uncon
scious in his passing and his receivers |
got brilliant all of a sudden. That
was the difference." .
"We looked very bad in that first
half," said Taylor. "And we had
only the passing attack in the
second. I thought we could run at
least a few yards against them— j
but any time we made more than
two yards we were lucky."
"There just isn't much a team can
do when a passer gets as hot as Gar- •
rett was Saturday, i don't ever ex
| pect to see him as hot as that again
—and I may never see as hot a
passer again."
In view of the fact that his team
making yardage from scrimmage, the
33-year-old coach expected that his
team would nass, even if it rained,
against Washington at Seattle.
"I've see some of the best pass
ing done in the rain." he said.
"With the way they keep (he hall
j dry for every play now, the rain
! doesn't make too much difference."
He admitted that he expected
plenty of trouble from the Husky
split-T—which is wider than any he
has ever seen. Washington, beaten
twice outside the conference, has
whipped Oregon and Oregon State
J and tied with Southern California
| inside the conference.
