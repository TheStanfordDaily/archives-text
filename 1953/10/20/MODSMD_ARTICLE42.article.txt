# Halfback Truher Lost for Season
## 
### 
Trainer Connie Jarvis declared
that Jim Truher, the wing-footed
soph left half, is through with foot
ball for the season.
Truher, who has been clocked at
9.8 in the 100. received a shoulder
separation when he returned the
second-half kick-off. The loss of
Truher was a blow, as the coaching
staff regarded him as a player with
a great deal of potential. They had
planned to give him a lot of work
in the San Jose State and WSC
games.
Tackle Barry Smith ran around in
sweat clothes, and Jarvis said that
chances were "better than 50-50"
that he would make the trip to
Washington this week.
The second and third teams ran
through a full-dress scrimmage,
• with end John Stewart, half Bill
i Rogers, quarterback Jack Gebert,
and half Phil Backer standing out.
