# Stanford Players 'Delightfully Act Thurber-Nugent's 'The Male Animal'
## 
### JAYNE KRAVIG 
From the first insistent ring
ing of the telephone to the final
"kiss and make up" scene, the
Stanford Players last night gave
a delightful production of the
Thurber-Nugent three-act com
edy, "The Male Animal."
Throughout the play the action
was kept at a high pitch, achieving
the rare point of being able to hold
the attention of the audience even
when all the action took place off
stage. The dialogue was rapid and
.sure-fire, carrying the capacity au
dience through the woes of a col
lege English prolessor who because
of a simple assignment in English
composition finds himself respon
sible for his own di.- missal, a threat
ened divorce from his wife, and the
confusion of the lives of a number
of people.
Don Sonic, as Tommy Turner,
the professor, was excellent. Par
ticularly good was his interpreta
tion of the aggrieved male feeling
the distinct need for defending the
sanctity of the home but has very
little idea of how to go about it.
Unfortunately, he was somewhat
weak on the major issues, the prob
lem of academic freedom, Commu
nism in American colleges, and the
domination of the intellectual side
of learning by the pseudo-impor
tance of football players and new
stadiums.
Virginia Kovce, as IJIcn, his
wife, was uncertain and to a cer
tain degree false in the first few
scenes, hut improved momenta

i rily until she was <I<»i11 ;i con
vincing and competent jol) of por
traying a wife w ho doesn't know
whether she has been discarded
or not.
Rossiter Durfee was superb as
: Ellen's ex-beau and ;ilso ex-foot-
I bit 11 player who points up both
1 Tommy's difficulties with Ellen and
the emphasis on athletics. Particu
larly striking was his acting during
discussions on the intellectual side.
; of which, as a football player who
"hasn't read a book in years," he
can comprehend nothing.
The supporting roles were also
well played. Most outstanding were
Melba Mathias who epitomized
American college girls, Clare Babb
; as the cheerful but slightly incom
petent maid, Philip Angeloff as Mi
chael Barnes whose editorial on
faculty submission to "Fascist"
trustees set off the whole situation,
| and Hugo Melchione as one of the
trustees most rapid on the subject
of football and the good name of
Midwestern U.
Among the most outstanding
scenes were the group scenes. One
of the best was the party scene
in the first act which gave a brutal
ly frank picture of the typical
party small talk and ice-breaking;
especially good was the acting of
Beulah Baylcss and Inge Schmidt
as the wife of the dean and tin
wife of the trustee, who immcdi
atch leapt into a heated discussion
of people's operations.
Also notable was the scene in
which Joe, the greatest football
player Midwestern has ever known,
I explains the Statue of Liberty play

by means of cups, glasses, and jam
pots.
There were few rough spots; the
most noticable being a tendency to
overplay the humorous scenes. At
times the subtlety of Thurber's hu
mor was practically beaten into the
audience which, however, showed
a thorough appreciation of the-play.
Some of the characterizations also
varied between losing themselves
and dominating the whole Little
Theater. This will probably be im
proved in later performances.
"The Male Animal ' was presented
under the direction of Robert Lopcr,
who is to be complimented on his
work.
The play will continue its Stanford
run through Saturday.

Rossiter Durfee, Melba Maihias, Don Soule, and Virginia Royce.
From the first insistent ring
ing of the telephone to the final
"kiss and make up" scene, the
Stanford Players last night gave
a delightful production of the
Thurber-Nugent three-act com
edy, "The Male Animal."
Throughout the play the action
was kept at a high pitch, achieving
the rare point of being able to hold
the attention of the audience even
when all the action took place off
stage. The dialogue was rapid and
.sure-fire, carrying the capacity au
dience through the woes of a col
lege English prolessor who because
of a simple assignment in English
composition finds himself respon
sible for his own di.- missal, a threat
ened divorce from his wife, and the
confusion of the lives of a number
of people.
Don Sonic, as Tommy Turner,
the professor, was excellent. Par
ticularly good was his interpreta
tion of the aggrieved male feeling
the distinct need for defending the
sanctity of the home but has very
little idea of how to go about it.
Unfortunately, he was somewhat
weak on the major issues, the prob
lem of academic freedom, Commu
nism in American colleges, and the
domination of the intellectual side
of learning by the pseudo-impor
tance of football players and new
stadiums.
Virginia Kovce, as IJIcn, his
wife, was uncertain and to a cer
tain degree false in the first few
scenes, hut improved momenta

i rily until she was <I<»i11 ;i con
vincing and competent jol) of por
traying a wife w ho doesn't know
whether she has been discarded
or not.
Rossiter Durfee was superb as

I bit 11 player who points up both
1 Tommy's difficulties with Ellen and
the emphasis on athletics. Particu
larly striking was his acting during
discussions on the intellectual side.
; of which, as a football player who
"hasn't read a book in years," he
can comprehend nothing.
The supporting roles were also
well played. Most outstanding were
Melba Mathias who epitomized
American college girls, Clare Babb
; as the cheerful but slightly incom
petent maid, Philip Angeloff as Mi
chael Barnes whose editorial on
faculty submission to "Fascist"
trustees set off the whole situation,
| and Hugo Melchione as one of the
trustees most rapid on the subject
of football and the good name of
Midwestern U.
Among the most outstanding
scenes were the group scenes. One
of the best was the party scene
in the first act which gave a brutal
ly frank picture of the typical
party small talk and ice-breaking;
especially good was the acting of
Beulah Baylcss and Inge Schmidt
as the wife of the dean and tin
wife of the trustee, who immcdi
atch leapt into a heated discussion
of people's operations.
Also notable was the scene in
which Joe, the greatest football
player Midwestern has ever known,
I explains the Statue of Liberty play

by means of cups, glasses, and jam
pots.
There were few rough spots; the
most noticable being a tendency to
overplay the humorous scenes. At
times the subtlety of Thurber's hu
mor was practically beaten into the
audience which, however, showed
a thorough appreciation of the-play.
Some of the characterizations also
varied between losing themselves
and dominating the whole Little
Theater. This will probably be im
proved in later performances.
"The Male Animal ' was presented
under the direction of Robert Lopcr,
who is to be complimented on his
work.
The play will continue its Stanford
run through Saturday.

From the first insistent ring
ing of the telephone to the final
"kiss and make up" scene, the
Stanford Players last night gave
a delightful production of the
Thurber-Nugent three-act com
edy, "The Male Animal."
Throughout the play the action
was kept at a high pitch, achieving
the rare point of being able to hold
the attention of the audience even
when all the action took place off
stage. The dialogue was rapid and
.sure-fire, carrying the capacity au
dience through the woes of a col
lege English prolessor who because
of a simple assignment in English
composition finds himself respon
sible for his own di.- missal, a threat
ened divorce from his wife, and the
confusion of the lives of a number
of people.
Don Sonic, as Tommy Turner,
the professor, was excellent. Par
ticularly good was his interpreta
tion of the aggrieved male feeling
the distinct need for defending the
sanctity of the home but has very
little idea of how to go about it.
Unfortunately, he was somewhat
weak on the major issues, the prob
lem of academic freedom, Commu
nism in American colleges, and the
domination of the intellectual side
of learning by the pseudo-impor
tance of football players and new
stadiums.
Virginia Kovce, as IJIcn, his
wife, was uncertain and to a cer
tain degree false in the first few
scenes, hut improved momenta

i rily until she was <I<»i11 ;i con
vincing and competent jol) of por
traying a wife w ho doesn't know
whether she has been discarded
or not.
Rossiter Durfee was superb as
: Ellen's ex-beau and ;ilso ex-foot-
I bit 11 player who points up both
1 Tommy's difficulties with Ellen and
the emphasis on athletics. Particu
larly striking was his acting during
discussions on the intellectual side.
; of which, as a football player who
"hasn't read a book in years," he
can comprehend nothing.
The supporting roles were also
well played. Most outstanding were
Melba Mathias who epitomized
American college girls, Clare Babb
; as the cheerful but slightly incom
petent maid, Philip Angeloff as Mi
chael Barnes whose editorial on
faculty submission to "Fascist"
trustees set off the whole situation,
| and Hugo Melchione as one of the
trustees most rapid on the subject
of football and the good name of
Midwestern U.
Among the most outstanding
scenes were the group scenes. One
of the best was the party scene
in the first act which gave a brutal
ly frank picture of the typical
party small talk and ice-breaking;
especially good was the acting of
Beulah Baylcss and Inge Schmidt
as the wife of the dean and tin
wife of the trustee, who immcdi
atch leapt into a heated discussion
of people's operations.
Also notable was the scene in
which Joe, the greatest football
player Midwestern has ever known,
I explains the Statue of Liberty play

by means of cups, glasses, and jam
pots.
There were few rough spots; the
most noticable being a tendency to
overplay the humorous scenes. At
times the subtlety of Thurber's hu
mor was practically beaten into the
audience which, however, showed
a thorough appreciation of the-play.
Some of the characterizations also
varied between losing themselves
and dominating the whole Little
Theater. This will probably be im
proved in later performances.
