### WIN GRIFFITH 
Stanford University received
more money in gifts from more
persons during the year 1552-
53 than ever before in its history,
President Wallace Sterling has
announced.
A report issued by the General
Secretary's office said that 12,009
gilts—a new record—totaled $3,985,-
471. This amount outstripped by
nearly half a million dollars the
previous record set in 1944-45.
The number of individual gifts
exceeded the 11,107 gifts amounting
to $3,895,093 during the fiscal year
1951-52.
Gifts came from individuals in
all 48 states and from residents of
foreign countries in all parts of

the world. California donors con
tributed 8,823 gifts amounting to
$2,576,017.
Most of the gifts, the General
Secretary's office said, were re
stricted to specific uses. Unrestrict- '
ed gifts added up to $356,458, a fig
ure higher than originally antici
pated by the office.
The largest single gift was in the
form of securities valued at more
than $300,000, donated by Mrs. Silas
H. Palmer of Menlo Park to estab
lish an unrestricted endowment
fund.
A $250,000 grant was the second
largest gift of the year. Sent by the
Fund for the Advancement of Edu
cation, an independent corporation
set up by the Ford Foundation, it
will be used to start a graduate
study program in the humanities.
Approximately 18 per cent of
the gifts, or $715,204, was desig

nated for student aid in scholar
ships, fellowships, loan funds, and
grants-in-aid. Of that sum, $307,-
642 was specified for scholarships
and fellowships in particular
schools and departments.
About 33 per cent, or $1,315,205,
has been set aside for use in re
search.
The General Secretary's office
said that gifts for student aid were
down slightly from last year and
that research donations had in
creased.
Exclusive of gifts designated for
buildings, the various schools and
departments received the following
portions of the total gifts:
Med School, 23 per cent; Human
ities and Sciences, 23 per cent; Bus
iness School, 7 per cent; Engineer
ing, 2.7 per cent; Education, 2.5 per
cent; Mineral Sciences, 2.2 per cent;
Law School, 1.2 per cent.

Part of the balance of the gifts
was distributed among the Univer
sity libraries.
The number of the various
types of donors and the amounts
they contributed were as follows:
A total of 11,333 living individuals
$1,260,640; 53 bequests, $504,647; 161
foundations, $1,180,073 (new high);
274 industries and businesses, $534,-
147 (new high); 122 associations,
$144,660; 66 other sources, $361,302.
A substantial portion of the in
dustry and business gifts will go to
establish the C. O. G. Miller distin
guished professorship in the Stan
ford Graduate School of Business.
Alumni giving also rose to a
new record, with 10,828 gifts to
taling $361,709. The previous rec
ord was last year, when 9,905
alumni contributed $1149,974.
Gene K. Walker, chairman of the
Stanford Fund, attributed the rec

ords in part to the large number of
volunteers working on the fund
raising program.
"This is a heterogeneous group,"
Walker said in a recent report t<j
alumni. "It is widely dispersed ge
ographically, but united by a com
mon belief in independent higher
education as we have known it at
Stanford."
Such fund - raising programs as
the Stanford Fund have been ini
tiated at Stanford in past years iri
an attempt to offset the financial
burdens of the University. In re
cent years, the financial outlook for
Stanford has become what Univer
sity leaders describe as a "tight sit
uation."
Gifts and bequests are one of the
three sources of the University's in
come. The two other primary
sources are the income on the en
dowment and student tuition fee:..

alumni. "It is widely dispersed ge
ographically, but united by a com
mon belief in independent higher
education as we have known it at
Stanford."
Such fund - raising programs as
the Stanford Fund have been ini
tiated at Stanford in past years iri
an attempt to offset the financial
burdens of the University. In re

Stanford has become what Univer

Stanford University received
more money in gifts from more
persons during the year 1552-
53 than ever before in its history,
President Wallace Sterling has
announced.
A report issued by the General
Secretary's office said that 12,009
gilts—a new record—totaled $3,985,-
471. This amount outstripped by
nearly half a million dollars the
previous record set in 1944-45.
The number of individual gifts
exceeded the 11,107 gifts amounting
to $3,895,093 during the fiscal year
1951-52.
Gifts came from individuals in
all 48 states and from residents of
foreign countries in all parts of

the world. California donors con
tributed 8,823 gifts amounting to
$2,576,017.
Most of the gifts, the General
Secretary's office said, were re
stricted to specific uses. Unrestrict- '
ed gifts added up to $356,458, a fig
ure higher than originally antici
pated by the office.
The largest single gift was in the
form of securities valued at more
than $300,000, donated by Mrs. Silas
H. Palmer of Menlo Park to estab
lish an unrestricted endowment
fund.
A $250,000 grant was the second
largest gift of the year. Sent by the
Fund for the Advancement of Edu
cation, an independent corporation
set up by the Ford Foundation, it
will be used to start a graduate
study program in the humanities.
Approximately 18 per cent of
the gifts, or $715,204, was desig

nated for student aid in scholar
ships, fellowships, loan funds, and
grants-in-aid. Of that sum, $307,-
642 was specified for scholarships
and fellowships in particular
schools and departments.
About 33 per cent, or $1,315,205,
has been set aside for use in re
search.
The General Secretary's office
said that gifts for student aid were
down slightly from last year and
that research donations had in
creased.
Exclusive of gifts designated for
buildings, the various schools and
departments received the following
portions of the total gifts:
Med School, 23 per cent; Human
ities and Sciences, 23 per cent; Bus
iness School, 7 per cent; Engineer
ing, 2.7 per cent; Education, 2.5 per
cent; Mineral Sciences, 2.2 per cent;
Law School, 1.2 per cent.

Part of the balance of the gifts
was distributed among the Univer
sity libraries.
The number of the various
types of donors and the amounts
they contributed were as follows:
A total of 11,333 living individuals
$1,260,640; 53 bequests, $504,647; 161
foundations, $1,180,073 (new high);
274 industries and businesses, $534,-
147 (new high); 122 associations,
$144,660; 66 other sources, $361,302.
A substantial portion of the in
dustry and business gifts will go to
establish the C. O. G. Miller distin
guished professorship in the Stan
ford Graduate School of Business.
Alumni giving also rose to a
new record, with 10,828 gifts to
taling $361,709. The previous rec
ord was last year, when 9,905
alumni contributed $1149,974.
Gene K. Walker, chairman of the
Stanford Fund, attributed the rec

ords in part to the large number of
volunteers working on the fund
raising program.

establish the C. O. G. Miller distin
guished professorship in the Stan
ford Graduate School of Business.
Alumni giving also rose to a
new record, with 10,828 gifts to
taling $361,709. The previous rec
ord was last year, when 9,905
alumni contributed $1149,974.
Gene K. Walker, chairman of the
Stanford Fund, attributed the rec

ords in part to the large number of
volunteers working on the fund
raising program.
"This is a heterogeneous group,"
Walker said in a recent report t<j
alumni. "It is widely dispersed ge
ographically, but united by a com
mon belief in independent higher
education as we have known it at
Stanford."
Such fund - raising programs as
the Stanford Fund have been ini
tiated at Stanford in past years iri
an attempt to offset the financial
burdens of the University. In re
cent years, the financial outlook for
Stanford has become what Univer
sity leaders describe as a "tight sit
uation."
Gifts and bequests are one of the
three sources of the University's in
come. The two other primary
sources are the income on the en
dowment and student tuition fee:..
Stanford University received
more money in gifts from more
persons during the year 1552-
53 than ever before in its history,
President Wallace Sterling has
announced.
A report issued by the General
Secretary's office said that 12,009
gilts—a new record—totaled $3,985,-
471. This amount outstripped by
nearly half a million dollars the
previous record set in 1944-45.
The number of individual gifts
exceeded the 11,107 gifts amounting
to $3,895,093 during the fiscal year
1951-52.
Gifts came from individuals in
all 48 states and from residents of
foreign countries in all parts of

the world. California donors con
tributed 8,823 gifts amounting to
$2,576,017.
Most of the gifts, the General
Secretary's office said, were re
stricted to specific uses. Unrestrict- '
ed gifts added up to $356,458, a fig
ure higher than originally antici
pated by the office.
The largest single gift was in the
form of securities valued at more
than $300,000, donated by Mrs. Silas
H. Palmer of Menlo Park to estab
lish an unrestricted endowment
fund.
A $250,000 grant was the second
largest gift of the year. Sent by the
Fund for the Advancement of Edu
cation, an independent corporation
set up by the Ford Foundation, it
will be used to start a graduate
study program in the humanities.
Approximately 18 per cent of
the gifts, or $715,204, was desig

nated for student aid in scholar
ships, fellowships, loan funds, and
grants-in-aid. Of that sum, $307,-
642 was specified for scholarships
and fellowships in particular
schools and departments.
About 33 per cent, or $1,315,205,
has been set aside for use in re
search.
The General Secretary's office
said that gifts for student aid were
down slightly from last year and
that research donations had in
creased.
Exclusive of gifts designated for
buildings, the various schools and
departments received the following
portions of the total gifts:
Med School, 23 per cent; Human
ities and Sciences, 23 per cent; Bus
iness School, 7 per cent; Engineer
ing, 2.7 per cent; Education, 2.5 per
cent; Mineral Sciences, 2.2 per cent;
Law School, 1.2 per cent.

Part of the balance of the gifts
was distributed among the Univer
sity libraries.
The number of the various
types of donors and the amounts
they contributed were as follows:
A total of 11,333 living individuals
$1,260,640; 53 bequests, $504,647; 161
foundations, $1,180,073 (new high);
274 industries and businesses, $534,-
147 (new high); 122 associations,
$144,660; 66 other sources, $361,302.
