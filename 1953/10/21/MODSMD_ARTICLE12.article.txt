### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Oct. 20
(UP) —The United Nations Security
Council put of! its Trieste debate
tonight until Nov. 2 despite a Soviet
warning that the quarrel contained
the seeds of a world war and should
be taken up at once.
The postponement proposal,
adopted 9 to 1 (Russia) was made
by Colombia to give the Western
powers time to work out a direct
settlement in negotiations with the
two countries struggling for the
area, Italy and Yugoslavia. Lebanon
abstained.
It was Soviet Delegate Andrei Y.
VMiinsky who told the Council,
during the almost-four-hour debate
that preceded the vote, that the sit
uation was dangerous and that a
war might erupt unless the U.N.
stepped in.
Such a conflict, he said, would
spread through Europe and "once
Europe is on fire, so will be the
world."
American Delegate- James J.
Wadsworth countered by telling the
11-nation Council that no govern
ment was more interested than the
United States in "obtaining peace
for this troubled area of Trieste."
(In New York, Secretary of State
John Foster Dulles urged Italy and
Yugoslavia tonight to settle the ex
plosive Trieste dispute and join
other free nations in a Southern
European defense system against
Soviet Communism.)
