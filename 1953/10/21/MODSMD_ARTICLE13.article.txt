Today i.s the last day for Roble
residents and off-campus freshman
women to have their pictures taken
for the Frosh Book.
Tomorrow, devoted to pictures of
all Branner Hall freshmen, will
wind up the two-week-long process
of photographing.
The Frosh Book will be out by
Thanksgiving and will cost $1.25.
