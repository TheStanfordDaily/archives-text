# TUESDAY SERIES
## Dr. Stebbins Discusses 'Stars in Their Spaces' 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Astronomer Joel Stebbins, who was recently honored with an
LL.D. degree from the University of California, took over the
Tuesday Evening Series lecture in Memorial Auditorium last night
with a discussion of "Stars in Their Spaces."
Dr. Stebbins, a research associate at Lick Observatory, Mt.

Hamilton, wove his talk around a
variety of slides. He displayed pic
tures of astronomical instruments,
photographs of galaxies, and dia
grams of interspatial relationships
and light intensity.
The first slide showed the photo
electric cell discovered by Dr. Steb
bins with which he was able to
take precise readings of the light
and color of stars. He was able to
measure the light magnitude of a
candle seven miles distant with the
instrument.
Tlie scale of the universe, the
distance between spatial bodies,
and the quantities of light pro-,
duccd by stars were the main
points covered in the speech.
To demonstrate the tremendous
distances in space, Dr. Stebbins told
that the stars in the Little Dipper,
which move as a unit, travel as far
as the diameter of the Dipper every
300,000 years.
Dr. Stebbins said, "One hundred
million stars make a galaxy; 100
million galaxies make one uni
verse."
"Space is filled with gas, dust, and
chunks," he continued. "Anything
from the size of a pinhead to the
size of the earth we will call a
chunk. The chunks are invisible as
far as our pictures are concerned,
but you can see the gas and dust."
He showed how the dust be
tween the telescope and a star
could lie measured by contrasting
the spectroscopic color of a star
with what is known to be the
true color.
While discussing specks on a pic
ture of a star cluster, Dr. Stebbins
declared, "Sometimes it takes a
doctor's degree to distinguish be
tween a photographic defect and a
globular mass."
Dr. Stebbins was introduced by
Mathematics Professor Harold M
Bacon, the chairman of the Com
mittee oiv Public Exercises which
sponsors the Tuesday Evening Se
ries.

with a discussion of "Stars in Their Spaces."
Dr. Stebbins, a research associate at Lick Observatory, Mt.

Hamilton, wove his talk around a
variety of slides. He displayed pic
tures of astronomical instruments,
photographs of galaxies, and dia
grams of interspatial relationships
and light intensity.
The first slide showed the photo
electric cell discovered by Dr. Steb
bins with which he was able to
take precise readings of the light
and color of stars. He was able to
measure the light magnitude of a
candle seven miles distant with the
instrument.
Tlie scale of the universe, the
distance between spatial bodies,
and the quantities of light pro-,
duccd by stars were the main
points covered in the speech.
To demonstrate the tremendous
distances in space, Dr. Stebbins told
that the stars in the Little Dipper,
which move as a unit, travel as far
as the diameter of the Dipper every
300,000 years.
Dr. Stebbins said, "One hundred
million stars make a galaxy; 100
million galaxies make one uni
verse."
"Space is filled with gas, dust, and
chunks," he continued. "Anything
from the size of a pinhead to the
size of the earth we will call a
chunk. The chunks are invisible as
far as our pictures are concerned,
but you can see the gas and dust."
He showed how the dust be
tween the telescope and a star
could lie measured by contrasting
the spectroscopic color of a star
with what is known to be the
true color.
While discussing specks on a pic
ture of a star cluster, Dr. Stebbins
declared, "Sometimes it takes a
doctor's degree to distinguish be
tween a photographic defect and a
globular mass."
Dr. Stebbins was introduced by
Mathematics Professor Harold M
Bacon, the chairman of the Com
mittee oiv Public Exercises which
sponsors the Tuesday Evening Se
ries.
Astronomer Joel Stebbins, who was recently honored with an
LL.D. degree from the University of California, took over the
Tuesday Evening Series lecture in Memorial Auditorium last night
