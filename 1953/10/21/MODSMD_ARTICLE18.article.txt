# French Officials, Ed School Faculty To Confer Today
## 
### 
A team of 11 top-ranking officials
of the French Ministry of Educa
tion, who are studying American
educational methods as part of a
program of reorganization of the
French school system, will confer
today with members of the Stanford
School of Education faculty.
Working under the direct super
vision of the French Minister of Ed
ucation, Andre Marie, the group is
making a month's intensive survey
in the United States under the aus
pices of the Foreign Operations Ad
ministration.
F renc h officials believe that
French education now channels too
many young people into the already
overcrowded liberal professions to
the detriment of industry, agricul
ture, and commerce, where there is
a shortage of trained personnel for
middle management and supervi
sory jobs.
The present survey is concerned
with teaching techniques, especially
in economics and the social sciences.
