Chances are the Executive Committee will
reject membership in the National Students
Association tonight.
Such action would be valid, we think, if the
members of Excom had sufficiently studied the
organization and implications of NSA. And
such action would be valid if the student body
had been properly orientated on the subject of
a possible membership for Stanford in NSA.
But we are not sure that the Executive Com
mittee has studied all the details ol the Na
tional Students Association. We are sure,
hov/ever, that the student body had not been
fully orientated on NSA.
We don't think Stanford students are aware
of both the potential and definite values of NSA
to Stanford. We question the apparently over
whelming demand of students for "concrete"
values and the apparent disregard of any con
sideration ol the deeper and more subtle mean
ings of NSA.
The "concrete" values are there. We wonder
if students have heard about the information
service which NSA provides for its members,
a service which compiles, publishes, and dis
tributes reports prepared by special NSA com
mittees. An example of such a report is a plan
for a college faculty evaluation program, some
thing which Stanford has needed and wanted
for many years. The study and the work has
already been done by NSA. Stanford could
easily adjust the suggested plan to its own cir
cumstances.
t
The deeper values of NSA are more diffi
cult to understand without extensive study
and much thought; we wonder if students
have given those values such study and
thought. There is strong evidence that an
organization such as NSA, an organization
which in time could act as the voice for
American college students, would be of im
mense value to Stanford students as mem
bers of the larger national and international
communities.
NSA officers have emphasized that America
is one of the few countries in the world where
students do not have a voice by which they
can effectively participate in public affairs. But
that voice must be strong if that effective par
ticipation is to be achieved. And to be strong
it must represent the greatest number of col
leges possible, especially those with high aca
demic and social reputations, especially those
like Stanford.
The success of the "concrete" values and the
higher ideals of NSA is not guaranteed. The
leaders of NSA are aware of the possibility
that the college students of this country might
not want to participate in the public affairs o"f
their country. But if that desire is there, it
should have a medium through which it could
be effectively channeled. NSA would act as
that medium.
And NSA supporters are aware that its
programs could fail if they are not adminis
tered by adeguate personnel.
Whatever the chances for success, an at
tempt should be made. The ultimate benefits,
if achieved, would justify the cost and energy
expended by Stanford in NSA membership.
And they unquestionably would justify the
small amount of time necessary for a fair and
detailed study of NSA by the members of the
Executive Committee and the Stanford student
body. —Win Griffith

When considering the question of whether
Stanford should join the National Students As
sociation, it would seem that students, above
all, must be coldly realistic.
They must weigh the advantages and disad
vantages, and they must judge accurately stu
dent opinion as it exists, not as it should be.
At the moment student opinion — despite
more than a year of serious discussion before
the Executive Committee and frequent articles
in The Daily—apparently continues markedly
apathetic and disinterested.
It is obvious that there is no demand on the
part of the student body as a whole for par
ticipation in NSA's many programs.
And, indeed, it would seem a precarious
gamble that student opinion would ever be en
flamed by membership.
Such apathy—as reflected in the obvious
shrug-the-shoulders attitude of most students
toward NSA—has long been a serious prob
lem at Stanford, but we can see in no way
how bringing the organization to campus
will improve this lamentable situation.
Certainly, general apathy was not even
slightly dispelled during the period of 1947—
1950 when this University was a member of the
association. Reports detailing our membership |
indicate strongly that student opinion was
never much aroused in NSA and that because
of this our association was dropped.
If student interest is at such a low ebb—as it
apparently is— it would seem that membership
in an organization such as NSA that poses as
the "voice" of students, nationally and inter
nationally, would be decidedly impracticable.
For, in the face of such indifference, it would
seem extremely doubtful that a representative
from Stanford could ever accurately record the
sentiments of the majority of his fellow stu
dents.
Yet, a surely measured opinion is vitally
essential, particularly considering that NSA
freely discussess and acts on such heated
controversies as McCarthyism, the recogni
tion of Red China and FEPC.
Stanford, if it intends to be a conscientious
member of the organization, must be prepared
to take stands on these and other issues, some
thing the University, almost traditionally, has
not been prepared to do. As regrettable as
this might be, it still is fact and must be seri
ously coped with by student leaders. Some
strides have been made of late by students in
reducing this University's seemingly ivory
tower attitude.
Further strides are possible and most de
sirable, but considering the attitudes of most
students and the inherent conservatism of
the administration, it would seem doubtful
whether the NSA would be any more help
ful in generating student interest today than
it was three years ago.
And, reciprocally, because of our unfortun
ate but nonetheless iron-clad traditionalism
toward practical political partisanship, it would
seem that we could be of little significant as
sistance to the association.
Aside from some slight material aids—such
as condensed manuals and parliamentary pro
cedure we can see no value in membership
that would justify tho, possible $800 annual
cost.

reject membership in the National Students
Association tonight.

vantages, and they must judge accurately stu
dent opinion as it exists, not as it should be.
At the moment student opinion — despite
more than a year of serious discussion before
the Executive Committee and frequent articles
in The Daily—apparently continues markedly
apathetic and disinterested.
It is obvious that there is no demand on the
part of the student body as a whole for par
ticipation in NSA's many programs.
And, indeed, it would seem a precarious
gamble that student opinion would ever be en
flamed by membership.
Such apathy—as reflected in the obvious
shrug-the-shoulders attitude of most students
toward NSA—has long been a serious prob
lem at Stanford, but we can see in no way
how bringing the organization to campus
will improve this lamentable situation.
Certainly, general apathy was not even
slightly dispelled during the period of 1947—
1950 when this University was a member of the
association. Reports detailing our membership |
indicate strongly that student opinion was
never much aroused in NSA and that because
of this our association was dropped.
If student interest is at such a low ebb—as it
apparently is— it would seem that membership
in an organization such as NSA that poses as
the "voice" of students, nationally and inter
nationally, would be decidedly impracticable.
For, in the face of such indifference, it would
seem extremely doubtful that a representative
from Stanford could ever accurately record the
sentiments of the majority of his fellow stu
dents.
Yet, a surely measured opinion is vitally
essential, particularly considering that NSA
freely discussess and acts on such heated
controversies as McCarthyism, the recogni
tion of Red China and FEPC.
Stanford, if it intends to be a conscientious
member of the organization, must be prepared
to take stands on these and other issues, some
thing the University, almost traditionally, has
not been prepared to do. As regrettable as
this might be, it still is fact and must be seri
ously coped with by student leaders. Some
strides have been made of late by students in
reducing this University's seemingly ivory
tower attitude.
Further strides are possible and most de
sirable, but considering the attitudes of most
students and the inherent conservatism of
the administration, it would seem doubtful
whether the NSA would be any more help
ful in generating student interest today than
it was three years ago.
And, reciprocally, because of our unfortun
ate but nonetheless iron-clad traditionalism
toward practical political partisanship, it would
seem that we could be of little significant as
sistance to the association.
Aside from some slight material aids—such
as condensed manuals and parliamentary pro
cedure we can see no value in membership
that would justify tho, possible $800 annual
cost.
Chances are the Executive Committee will
reject membership in the National Students
Association tonight.
Such action would be valid, we think, if the
members of Excom had sufficiently studied the
organization and implications of NSA. And
such action would be valid if the student body
had been properly orientated on the subject of
a possible membership for Stanford in NSA.
But we are not sure that the Executive Com
mittee has studied all the details ol the Na
tional Students Association. We are sure,
hov/ever, that the student body had not been
fully orientated on NSA.
We don't think Stanford students are aware
of both the potential and definite values of NSA
to Stanford. We question the apparently over
whelming demand of students for "concrete"
values and the apparent disregard of any con
sideration ol the deeper and more subtle mean
ings of NSA.
The "concrete" values are there. We wonder
if students have heard about the information
service which NSA provides for its members,
a service which compiles, publishes, and dis
tributes reports prepared by special NSA com
mittees. An example of such a report is a plan
for a college faculty evaluation program, some
thing which Stanford has needed and wanted
for many years. The study and the work has
already been done by NSA. Stanford could
easily adjust the suggested plan to its own cir
cumstances.
t
The deeper values of NSA are more diffi
cult to understand without extensive study
and much thought; we wonder if students
have given those values such study and
thought. There is strong evidence that an
organization such as NSA, an organization
which in time could act as the voice for
American college students, would be of im
mense value to Stanford students as mem
bers of the larger national and international
communities.
NSA officers have emphasized that America
is one of the few countries in the world where
students do not have a voice by which they
can effectively participate in public affairs. But
that voice must be strong if that effective par
ticipation is to be achieved. And to be strong
it must represent the greatest number of col
leges possible, especially those with high aca
demic and social reputations, especially those
like Stanford.
The success of the "concrete" values and the
higher ideals of NSA is not guaranteed. The
leaders of NSA are aware of the possibility
that the college students of this country might
not want to participate in the public affairs o"f
their country. But if that desire is there, it
should have a medium through which it could
be effectively channeled. NSA would act as
that medium.
And NSA supporters are aware that its
programs could fail if they are not adminis
tered by adeguate personnel.
Whatever the chances for success, an at
tempt should be made. The ultimate benefits,
if achieved, would justify the cost and energy
expended by Stanford in NSA membership.
And they unquestionably would justify the
small amount of time necessary for a fair and
detailed study of NSA by the members of the
Executive Committee and the Stanford student
body. —Win Griffith

tional Students Association. We are sure,
hov/ever, that the student body had not been
fully orientated on NSA.
We don't think Stanford students are aware
of both the potential and definite values of NSA
to Stanford. We question the apparently over
whelming demand of students for "concrete"
values and the apparent disregard of any con
sideration ol the deeper and more subtle mean
ings of NSA.
The "concrete" values are there. We wonder
if students have heard about the information
service which NSA provides for its members,
a service which compiles, publishes, and dis
tributes reports prepared by special NSA com
mittees. An example of such a report is a plan
for a college faculty evaluation program, some
thing which Stanford has needed and wanted
for many years. The study and the work has
already been done by NSA. Stanford could
easily adjust the suggested plan to its own cir
cumstances.
t
The deeper values of NSA are more diffi
cult to understand without extensive study
and much thought; we wonder if students
have given those values such study and
thought. There is strong evidence that an
organization such as NSA, an organization
which in time could act as the voice for
American college students, would be of im
mense value to Stanford students as mem
bers of the larger national and international
communities.
NSA officers have emphasized that America
is one of the few countries in the world where
students do not have a voice by which they
can effectively participate in public affairs. But
that voice must be strong if that effective par
ticipation is to be achieved. And to be strong
it must represent the greatest number of col
leges possible, especially those with high aca
demic and social reputations, especially those
like Stanford.
The success of the "concrete" values and the
higher ideals of NSA is not guaranteed. The
leaders of NSA are aware of the possibility
that the college students of this country might
not want to participate in the public affairs o"f
their country. But if that desire is there, it
should have a medium through which it could
be effectively channeled. NSA would act as
that medium.
And NSA supporters are aware that its
programs could fail if they are not adminis
tered by adeguate personnel.
Whatever the chances for success, an at
tempt should be made. The ultimate benefits,
if achieved, would justify the cost and energy
expended by Stanford in NSA membership.
And they unquestionably would justify the
small amount of time necessary for a fair and
detailed study of NSA by the members of the
Executive Committee and the Stanford student
body. —Win Griffith

When considering the question of whether
Stanford should join the National Students As
sociation, it would seem that students, above
all, must be coldly realistic.
They must weigh the advantages and disad
vantages, and they must judge accurately stu
dent opinion as it exists, not as it should be.
At the moment student opinion — despite
more than a year of serious discussion before
the Executive Committee and frequent articles
in The Daily—apparently continues markedly
apathetic and disinterested.
It is obvious that there is no demand on the
part of the student body as a whole for par
ticipation in NSA's many programs.
And, indeed, it would seem a precarious
gamble that student opinion would ever be en
flamed by membership.
Such apathy—as reflected in the obvious
shrug-the-shoulders attitude of most students
toward NSA—has long been a serious prob
lem at Stanford, but we can see in no way
how bringing the organization to campus
will improve this lamentable situation.
Certainly, general apathy was not even
slightly dispelled during the period of 1947—
1950 when this University was a member of the
association. Reports detailing our membership |
indicate strongly that student opinion was
never much aroused in NSA and that because
of this our association was dropped.
If student interest is at such a low ebb—as it
apparently is— it would seem that membership
in an organization such as NSA that poses as
the "voice" of students, nationally and inter
nationally, would be decidedly impracticable.
For, in the face of such indifference, it would
seem extremely doubtful that a representative
from Stanford could ever accurately record the
sentiments of the majority of his fellow stu
dents.
Yet, a surely measured opinion is vitally
essential, particularly considering that NSA
freely discussess and acts on such heated
controversies as McCarthyism, the recogni
tion of Red China and FEPC.
Stanford, if it intends to be a conscientious
member of the organization, must be prepared
to take stands on these and other issues, some
thing the University, almost traditionally, has
not been prepared to do. As regrettable as
this might be, it still is fact and must be seri
ously coped with by student leaders. Some
strides have been made of late by students in
reducing this University's seemingly ivory
tower attitude.
Further strides are possible and most de
sirable, but considering the attitudes of most
students and the inherent conservatism of
the administration, it would seem doubtful
whether the NSA would be any more help
ful in generating student interest today than
it was three years ago.
And, reciprocally, because of our unfortun
ate but nonetheless iron-clad traditionalism
toward practical political partisanship, it would
seem that we could be of little significant as
sistance to the association.
Aside from some slight material aids—such
as condensed manuals and parliamentary pro
cedure we can see no value in membership
that would justify tho, possible $800 annual
cost.
Chances are the Executive Committee will
reject membership in the National Students
Association tonight.
Such action would be valid, we think, if the
members of Excom had sufficiently studied the
organization and implications of NSA. And
such action would be valid if the student body
had been properly orientated on the subject of
a possible membership for Stanford in NSA.

ticipation in NSA's many programs.
And, indeed, it would seem a precarious
gamble that student opinion would ever be en
flamed by membership.
Such apathy—as reflected in the obvious
shrug-the-shoulders attitude of most students
toward NSA—has long been a serious prob
lem at Stanford, but we can see in no way
how bringing the organization to campus
will improve this lamentable situation.
Certainly, general apathy was not even
slightly dispelled during the period of 1947—
1950 when this University was a member of the
association. Reports detailing our membership |
indicate strongly that student opinion was
never much aroused in NSA and that because
of this our association was dropped.
If student interest is at such a low ebb—as it
apparently is— it would seem that membership
in an organization such as NSA that poses as
the "voice" of students, nationally and inter
nationally, would be decidedly impracticable.
For, in the face of such indifference, it would
seem extremely doubtful that a representative
from Stanford could ever accurately record the
sentiments of the majority of his fellow stu
dents.
Yet, a surely measured opinion is vitally
essential, particularly considering that NSA
freely discussess and acts on such heated
controversies as McCarthyism, the recogni
tion of Red China and FEPC.
Stanford, if it intends to be a conscientious
member of the organization, must be prepared
to take stands on these and other issues, some
thing the University, almost traditionally, has
not been prepared to do. As regrettable as
this might be, it still is fact and must be seri
ously coped with by student leaders. Some
strides have been made of late by students in
reducing this University's seemingly ivory
tower attitude.
Further strides are possible and most de
sirable, but considering the attitudes of most
students and the inherent conservatism of
the administration, it would seem doubtful
whether the NSA would be any more help
ful in generating student interest today than
it was three years ago.
And, reciprocally, because of our unfortun
ate but nonetheless iron-clad traditionalism
toward practical political partisanship, it would
seem that we could be of little significant as
sistance to the association.
Aside from some slight material aids—such
as condensed manuals and parliamentary pro
cedure we can see no value in membership
that would justify tho, possible $800 annual
cost.
