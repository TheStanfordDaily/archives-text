## 'Where Was Stanford?' 
### 
To the Editor:
From the efficient way things were being run at
the National Student Congress held this summer at
Ohio State University which Don Lozabniok and I
attended, NSA had come a long way from its meager
beginnings in 194G when 25 students returning from
the World Student Congress in Prague, Czechoslo
vakia awoke to the startling fact that the United
States was one of the few countries without a national
student organization. Over 350 schools were repre
sented by GOO delegates — the best their schools
could possibly send.
But, where was Stanford? Stanford was in the
role of the observer, there to see if NSA was worthy
of her rejoining. Stanford had pulled out of NSA in
I!>50 when the organization was experiencing many
growing pains as all organizations newly founded,
do. Stanford had pulled out when the going was
tough.
Why wasn't Stanford there in the role of n voting
delegate so that she could say she had a hand in the
implementation of its policy stands opposing the
recent cuts in the Air Force KOTC program which
affected many of our students adversely, or so that
she covdd say that she had a hand in presenting the
bill to Congress which is to exempt tuition from the
income tax of self-supporting students.
Yet, NSA is a confederacy and member schools
Tieed only take back to their campuses those views
which they feel represent their student body. Stan
ford need not take back what is not representative,
so what does she have to fear?
What other national organization can really claim
to be representative of over one million college and
university students?

What other national organization can represent the I
needs and opinions of college students to the pub
lic, state, and federal agencies—and to professional
educational organizations, whose acts directly affect
student welfare?
What other national organization acts as a clearing
house for information, services, and research directed
toward the establishment, strengthening, and im
provement of student government?
I realize that Stanford's student government is
among the top ones in the nation. But, I feel more
deeply that no school has a monopoly on wisdom,
thai no school can help hut learn more about the
strengthening and improving of its student govern
ment. Stanford certainly does not have all the
answers.
Stanford can also contribute much to help other
schools develop superior student government set
ups. It is not only our duty but moral obligation to
help students nationally and internationally to better
their conditions. It seems that $800 is a small sum to
pay to get Stanford's voice represented nationally and i
internationally, to share in the many services and
benefits offered by NSA, and to be able to take part
in the building of a tremendous organization con
cerned with the material and educational welfare of
students.
I feel strongly that Stanford will be missing out on
a great thing if she misses out on NSA! It is a won
der that Stanford is not already one of its most ac
tive members!
