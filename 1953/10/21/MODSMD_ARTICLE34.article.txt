# IN 1950
## Stanford Quit NSA For Budget Reasons

(E<l. Note: This is the last of three articles about the National Students
Association before Exconi discusses and possibly i'ntes on membership
in its meeting tonight.)

On Jan. 29, 1947, Stanford joined the National Students Asso
ciation.
On April 26, 1950, the ASSU Excom voted 3 to 3 against accept
ing NSA affiliation for the next year.
The views of then Student Manager John Lilienthal spotlighted

the opposition to NSA on budget
matters. lie objected to affiliation j
on the grounds that the students did |
not receive the maximum benefit of j
their dollar by belonging to NSA.
Lilienthal stated in his Student (
Manager's Report (1949-50) that:
"While very definitely we have got
ten a few worthwhile ideas (from I
NSA) and successfully put them j
into effect, I contend that in this |
field we are so much more advanced j
than others that we pay much and j
gain little."
While the financial picture had
much to do with disaffiliation from j
NSA, opposition was also evident '
from the students. Of this, Lilien- |
thai said, "I think a fair indication
of their (NSA's) popularity rested i
with the student body. As far as I
could see, it was not happy."
And speaking of the personnel of
NSA, he said, . . but in this case
we had some queer ones."
So with these arguments against
.

NSA, Stanford dropped its memlwr
ship.
but Excom was not able to drop
the concepts and aims of NSA. Even
Lilienthal said: "A more intelligent
approach to the problem was sug
gested immediately following the
formal disaffiliation: that a commit
tee of Excom should be empowered
to carry on the same funetion.s as
NSA on u purely local basis. ... II
the purpose is to better student gov
ernment, 1 feel that by concentra
tion on this subject, we will be able
to accomplish as much at no cost to
us."
Whether by inertia on the part of
Excom, or from opposition by other
quarters is not known, but such a
committee was never formed.
Financial opposition to NSA
stemmed from the fact that it cost
the ASSU $1,200 that year for mem
bership. This year's Student Man
ager, John Stahr, has estimated that
affiliation with NSA will cost Stan
ford a maximum of $800.
On a per capita basis, this $800
cost breaks down to a little more
than 10 cents per student per year.
Arguments in favor of NSA at the
time of Stanford's disaffiliation out
lined its work on the international,
national, and regional levels. Many
instances were also pointed out
j where Stanford groups had bene
l fited from NSA-pooled information
i and help.
