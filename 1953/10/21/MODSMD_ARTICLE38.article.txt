## POT SHOTS 
### 
The war of the Roses has burst into full bloom as Stanford, California, |
and Washington have become national powers after three of the most j
disastrous starts' in the history of the schools. UCLA is still tough and USC
is the spoiler.
Paralleling the rise of the Cards, Hears, and Huskies has been the rise
of quarterbacks Hob Garrett, Paul Larson, and Sandy Lederman.
It's been a rough year on quarterbacks. Zeke Bratkowski has been i
throwing often, connecting seldom as Georgia goes nowhere in the power- j
ful Southern Conference. Mississippi State's Jackie Parker has started
.slowly too.
John Horton of Ohio State looked only pretty g'ood against Cal. lie
threw the Illinois game away and showed nothing against Penn. Highly
touted Buddy Leake of Oklahoma and Tom Y'ewcic of Michigan State are
lighting for first-string berths on their own teams. Only Cotton David
son of Baylor and the three West Coast boys have held up.
The versatile Larson has passed to (>2O yards and run for 92 more to lead j
the coast in passing and total offense. Garrett's 19G yard barrage boosted J
his total uj> to t5()2 yards passing and Lederman has accounted for 529 yards j
it could well be that the team in the Rose Bowl will find itself piloted !
by an All-American quarterback and it might be Garrett in 1953, Larson
in '54, and Lederman in '55. Keep throwing, Bob.

Kay Luntiy, popular Stanford boxing coach, looks for Carl Olson to j
decision Itaiuly Turpin in tonight's televised middleweight championship
bout. Lunny, who predicted the Gavilan-Davey and Mareiano-Wolcott
lights perfectly for us last year, admits that he knows little about Turpin's
lighting ability. "IN- must have been good to beat Kay Robinson, but he j
has had trouble making the weight and that will tell over the fifteen
round distance."

Dink Templeton, ex-Stanford track coach and great punter of another I
era, writes a weekly column in the Palo Alto Times. Last Thursday he j
wiote a column in which he roasted the Daily for picking UCLA to beat
Stanford.
lie accuses Daily sports writers of showing a lack of spirit in picking
the Bruins, yet we cannot understand this equation of spirit and the belief
that Stanford will win.
In 1047 both the team and the rooting section went into almost every
game knowing that they would probably lose, yet neither ever lost their
spirit or will to win.
We cannot believe that the Stanford team actually cares' who a group
ol lads whose football experience is limited to the mural fields pick to win
Saturday's game.
They must know that (a) the game is decided on the field alone and
not in the newspapers, and (b) that every Stanford student, which in
cludes the Dippy writers, is solidly behind them regardless of what team
they think will win.
Templeton also blasts the Grid-O-Scope for listing Bob Garrett as "rough
but too slow on defense" and having little offensively but a magnificent
throwing arm."
"And here I thought Garrett was an outstanding pro prospect," moans
Dink.
Yet he must realize that pro teams still play two platoon football and j
the "slow on defense, but a great passer" description would fit such
high-priced pro stars as Norm Van Brocklin and Y. A. Tittle.
Saturday's win showed that the team was not perturbed by the Daily's
dire predictions, and we think Dink, who has not predicted a winner in
a Stanford game in the five years we have been reading his column, has
overrated the power of the press.

Kay Luntiy, popular Stanford boxing coach, looks for Carl Olson to j
decision Itaiuly Turpin in tonight's televised middleweight championship
bout. Lunny, who predicted the Gavilan-Davey and Mareiano-Wolcott

lighting ability. "IN- must have been good to beat Kay Robinson, but he j
has had trouble making the weight and that will tell over the fifteen

Dink Templeton, ex-Stanford track coach and great punter of another I
era, writes a weekly column in the Palo Alto Times. Last Thursday he j
wiote a column in which he roasted the Daily for picking UCLA to beat
Stanford.
lie accuses Daily sports writers of showing a lack of spirit in picking
the Bruins, yet we cannot understand this equation of spirit and the belief
that Stanford will win.
In 1047 both the team and the rooting section went into almost every
game knowing that they would probably lose, yet neither ever lost their
spirit or will to win.
We cannot believe that the Stanford team actually cares' who a group
ol lads whose football experience is limited to the mural fields pick to win
Saturday's game.
They must know that (a) the game is decided on the field alone and
not in the newspapers, and (b) that every Stanford student, which in
cludes the Dippy writers, is solidly behind them regardless of what team
they think will win.
Templeton also blasts the Grid-O-Scope for listing Bob Garrett as "rough
but too slow on defense" and having little offensively but a magnificent
throwing arm."
"And here I thought Garrett was an outstanding pro prospect," moans
Dink.
Yet he must realize that pro teams still play two platoon football and j
the "slow on defense, but a great passer" description would fit such
high-priced pro stars as Norm Van Brocklin and Y. A. Tittle.
Saturday's win showed that the team was not perturbed by the Daily's
dire predictions, and we think Dink, who has not predicted a winner in
a Stanford game in the five years we have been reading his column, has
overrated the power of the press.
The war of the Roses has burst into full bloom as Stanford, California, |
and Washington have become national powers after three of the most j
disastrous starts' in the history of the schools. UCLA is still tough and USC
is the spoiler.
Paralleling the rise of the Cards, Hears, and Huskies has been the rise
of quarterbacks Hob Garrett, Paul Larson, and Sandy Lederman.
It's been a rough year on quarterbacks. Zeke Bratkowski has been i
throwing often, connecting seldom as Georgia goes nowhere in the power- j
ful Southern Conference. Mississippi State's Jackie Parker has started
.slowly too.
John Horton of Ohio State looked only pretty g'ood against Cal. lie
threw the Illinois game away and showed nothing against Penn. Highly
touted Buddy Leake of Oklahoma and Tom Y'ewcic of Michigan State are
lighting for first-string berths on their own teams. Only Cotton David
