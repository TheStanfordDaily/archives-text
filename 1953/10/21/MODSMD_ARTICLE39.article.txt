# Card Rooters Seek Win

### 
Trying to regain winning ways, the Stanford soccer team, po
tentially one of the strongest in the school's history, travels down
the road a piece this afternoon to take on a vastly improved Santa
Clara club.
Santa Clara is on the way back this year, after being the league's

.salt touch last season. The Broncos
have given up American football
and have turned to the no-hands
variety of the game as their major
fall sport. In their debut last week,
they gave California an extremely
bad time before bowing 1-0.
Coach Leo Weinstein is really
worried about the encounter. His
line failed to score a single goal
from the field in last Saturday's
Stadium loss to S.F. State. They
failed to take advantage of count
less scoring opportunities. Stan
ford's only goal was scored on a
penalty kick,
Weinstein hope: that today's
stalling line of Bob Couture, left
wing; Sam Snare/., left inside; 'Tom
Hansen or Swaroop Bhandjeo, cen
ter forward; Chuck Andrews, right
inside; and Dick Koenigsberger,
right winy, will be able to end the
scoring drought.
Leo has his problems at the de
fensive positions too. Co-captain
and center halfback Derek Liectv

♦
received a knee injury last Sat
urday and cannot play today.
KiglU half Peter Mack will move
over to take his place.
The rest of the back positions will
be occupied by Sam Register at left
half; Don Yates at right; John Sen
tous and John Hanna at the full
backs; and Ken Woods in the goal.
