# THE
						DU PONT DIGEST
## Research 
### 
provides broad opportunities
for chemists, physicists
and engineers cooperating
on many problems.

lor one thing, much Du Pont re
search is fundamental, aimed at ad
vancing scientific knowledge regard
less of specific commercial objectives.
However, such research often sug
gests new products ... each with its
own challenging technical problems
which must be solved before com
mercial production can begin. Solv
ing these problems offers another
great field of work for teams of en
pincers and scientists.
"Teflon" tetrafluoroethylene resin
is an example of this well integrated
teamwork.

During research on refrigerants,
the polymer was discovered and work
was begun to make it useful. The new
plastic had a remarkable combina
tion of properties; temperature re
sistance beyond the range of any
previous plastic, excellent electrical
characteristics, and the highest de
gree of chemical inertness of any
commercial plastic.
In fact, "Teflon" was almost too
unusual. Although it melts, it is too
viscous to flow like other plastics. It
docs not dissolve—even inaquaregia.
There was no method for molding it
or for making it into thin coatings.
The problem of molding was solved
with the help of techniques used in
j>owder metallurgy. ' Teflon" is now
molded by cold pressing followed by
sintering or "fusing" at lbmit ru»o°(\

For coatings, previous research
suggested dispersions—minute par
ticles suspended in a liquid. After
much study, a team of technical men
learned how to suspend particles of
"Teflon" about 1 125,000 of an inch
in diameter. Then a commercial scale
process was devised. This develop
ment made possible thin coatings of
"Teflon" and also a process for ex
truding the material.
Meanwhile, another group discov
ered how to successfully formulate
the new plastic into "Teflon" tetra
fluoroethylene resin finishes and wire
enamels.
The development, of "Teflon" illus
trates the close teamwork that is the
basis of research at Du Pont. Hut
this teamwork doesn't end with re
search. Bringing the product to com
mercial reality requires development
and design work by chemistsand both
chemical and mechanical engineers.
Next month's Digest will feature in
formation on the opportunities Du
Pont offers men interested in this
phase of making "better things for
better living ... through chemistry."
