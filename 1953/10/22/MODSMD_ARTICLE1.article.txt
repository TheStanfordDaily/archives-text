## Excom Votes to Return To NSA by 10-3 Count 
### BOB REZAK Associate Editor, The Daily 
The ASSU Executive Committee last night—in a lengthy session that lasted into the late eve
ning hours—accepted a motion made by Student Manager John Stahr, calling for Stanford to join
the National Student Association.
At the end of a year, the motion read, the whole question of membership in NSA will be re
viewed by the chairmen of the various ASSU boards and ASSU officials, and then be voted upon
by the Executive Committee.
The motion was passed by a vote of 10 for, three against, and one abstention.
Stahr's motion read: "I move we join the NSA and that our membership be reviewed at the end

one year by ASSU officers,
; chairmen of ASSU boards, and
j the Executive Committee."
In an earlier vote, the Excom re
jected a motion for a one-year trial
membership that stipulated mem
bership in NSA would be reviewed
by student referendum. This mo
tion was killed by a vote of 11 to 3.
Arguments for membership in the
association were presented at the
meeting by Nancy Le Blanc, presi
dent of the California-Nevada-Ha
waii region of NSA, who is a Mills
College student; Sally Zook. presi
dent of the Associated Students of
Mills College, which is an NSA
member; and Steve Voykovich, for
mer vice-president of NSA, now at
tending Stanford.
The three, ardent proponents of
NSA, said they were heartily in
favor of Stanford joining the or
ganization of student bodies which
is represented through their stu
dent governments.
Miss Zook said that membership
in NSA offers a "broader perspec
tive" on student government, and
that it provides the "opportunity to
learn what the other colleges are
j doing."
She said that Mills College, as a
result of joining NSA, has "substan
tially improved"' its student govern
ment.
Miss Le Blanc said that only
two colleges in the Bay Area—
University of California and Mills
—were members of the NSA, and
that five colleges in Southern Cal
: ifornia were members.
''We feel that Stanford—as large
as it is and with the influence it
has—should belong to NSA." Miss
Zook declared.
Voykovich said he believed that
NSA was the "voice of the Ameri
| can student speaking."
In addition to reports by Excom
] members, and questions from the
I floor, three campus organizations—
j the Foreign Scholar Committee, the
Institute of International Relations,
and the Public Relations Committee
—presented their views on the pos
sibility of Stanford joining the
! group.
