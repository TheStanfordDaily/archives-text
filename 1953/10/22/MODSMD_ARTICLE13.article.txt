### 
"Can the United Nations pro
tect the peace?"
According to the results of an
informal poll conducted by The
Daily on campus this week, few
Stanford students think that any
world organization can offer a
positive guarantee of peace, but
almost all of them do think that
the U.N. performs a valuable
function.
The class and home state of the
students quoted are included to indi
cate the portion of the student body
represented in the poll.
The following people had this to
say:
Jean Gotschall, Tokyo, '57—"Fun
damentally the U.N. can only protect
the peace if all its members earnestly
try."
Shannon Ileath, California, 's(s—"lf
it is possible to protect the peace, the
U.N.-type organization can do as
well as any other."
Richard Henderson, California, '55
—"I don't think the U.N. is strong
enough. Until there is a world police
force nothing can be accomplished."
Jack Iloagland, California, '57—
"No, because as long as each nation
is hesitant to equally participate in
the U.N. with an unselfish attitude
toward further world peace, the or

Jim Howat, California, '55—"1 don't

Joyce Hupp, California, '54—"The ,
U.N. has done enough worthwhile !
things in other fields so that it's
worth keeping on trying. You can't
expect perfect peace."
Ray Looney, Idaho, '57—"No, be- j
cause I don't believe that the CortS
munistic countries will abide by j
written or oral agreements set up by i
the U.N. when it comes to a show- ;
down."
Briggitte Maldidier, France, Grad
—"I think that the U.N. is not able to
change the relations between the
states which are based upon a bal
ance of power. The U.N. is mainly a

world rostrum which disunited na
tions use to express their disagree
ments."
Ed IMunn, California, '57—"Yes, if
Russia stays in. If Russia were not;
in the U.N., the organization would
lose its value."
Chole Owens, California, '55—"1
don't think so. Peace is to be. found
in the individual. The world will lie
only as healthy or as sick as the in
dividuals who make it up, and all
the superimpositions of the states
men and engineers cannot penetrate
the matter. The remedy is that of
