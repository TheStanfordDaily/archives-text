# Daily's Poll of Students Reveals Doubt of UN Peace Guarantee
## 
### 
"Can the United Nations pro
tect the peace?"
According to the results of an
informal poll conducted by The
Daily on campus this week, few
Stanford students think that any
world organization can offer a
positive guarantee of peace, but
almost all of them do think that
the U.N. performs a valuable
function.
The class and home state of the
students quoted are included to indi
cate the portion of the student body
represented in the poll.
The following people had this to
say:
Jean Gotschall, Tokyo, '57—"Fun
damentally the U.N. can only protect
the peace if all its members earnestly
try."
Shannon Ileath, California, 's(s—"lf
it is possible to protect the peace, the
U.N.-type organization can do as
well as any other."
Richard Henderson, California, '55
—"I don't think the U.N. is strong
enough. Until there is a world police
force nothing can be accomplished."
Jack Iloagland, California, '57—
"No, because as long as each nation
is hesitant to equally participate in
the U.N. with an unselfish attitude
toward further world peace, the or
ganization cannot succeed."
Jim Howat, California, '55—"1 don't
feel that we have peace now. How

can we protect something that we I
don't have?"
Joyce Hupp, California, '54—"The ,
U.N. has done enough worthwhile !
things in other fields so that it's
worth keeping on trying. You can't
expect perfect peace."
Ray Looney, Idaho, '57—"No, be- j
cause I don't believe that the CortS
munistic countries will abide by j
written or oral agreements set up by i
the U.N. when it comes to a show- ;
down."
Briggitte Maldidier, France, Grad
—"I think that the U.N. is not able to
change the relations between the
states which are based upon a bal
ance of power. The U.N. is mainly a

world rostrum which disunited na
tions use to express their disagree
ments."
Ed IMunn, California, '57—"Yes, if
Russia stays in. If Russia were not;
in the U.N., the organization would
lose its value."
Chole Owens, California, '55—"1
don't think so. Peace is to be. found
in the individual. The world will lie
only as healthy or as sick as the in
dividuals who make it up, and all
the superimpositions of the states
men and engineers cannot penetrate
the matter. The remedy is that of
Peter Alcantara: 'If you reform your
self and I reform myself and if
everybody else reforms himself, then i
the world will be reformed.'"
Mary Sherman, Maryland, 'sfi—"l
don't think that the U.N. is strong
enough to protect the peace. Some
thing should be done about the veto."
John Sill, California, '55 — "I
frankly think that another war is
inevitable. The U.N. doesn't seem to
have the power to stop Russian ag- i
gression."
Kd Sing, California, '54—"1 don't
think so. Their word doesn't seem to
mean anything to anyone who is
serious about waging a war."
Mary Lou Smith, California, '54—
"There is need for an organization
which permits nations to work to
gether; perhaps the U.N. is this or- j
ganization; perhaps it isn't.
Katherine Thalberg, California. '56
"The U.N. is a fine tiling and should J

be able to protect the peace."
Neil Walker, Hawaii, '56—"No,
they haven't yet. They aren't strong
enough. I suggest that the U.N. let
Communist China in as a separate
nation in the assembly where they
have no voting or veto power. Keep
Formosa in the Security Council."
Marion Winn, Texas, '57—"If the
member nations abide by the rules
of the U.N., then it ought to be able
to protect the peace."
Jim Woodhead, Minnesota, '56—
"Yes, through proper co-operation
of each of the members, specifically
the Big Three, the U.N. can func
tion."
Ginny Burns, California, '54—"A
strong U.N. can, but not in its pres

| ent state. It't hard for countries to
I give up their selfish interests, which
actually seems like the only way."
Mike Criley. California, 2nd-year
Med.—"No, not until the United
States will get out of the driver's
seat and realize that it is 'a' United
Nation and not 'the' United Nations."
Don Ginter, California, '54—"The
U.N. is efFective for peace only so
long as member nations intend it to
be an instrument for that end. The
question is, 'What are the intentions
of the member nations?' I'm pessi
[ mistic."
Joyce Wylie, California, '56—"As
long as the United States continues
| to support it.the U.N. can maintain
peace. If Russia ever withdraws, the
United States probably will too, and
| the organization will become de
; funct."

"Can the United Nations pro
tect the peace?"
According to the results of an
informal poll conducted by The
Daily on campus this week, few
Stanford students think that any
world organization can offer a
positive guarantee of peace, but
almost all of them do think that
the U.N. performs a valuable
function.
The class and home state of the
students quoted are included to indi
cate the portion of the student body
represented in the poll.
The following people had this to
say:
Jean Gotschall, Tokyo, '57—"Fun
damentally the U.N. can only protect
the peace if all its members earnestly
try."
Shannon Ileath, California, 's(s—"lf
it is possible to protect the peace, the
U.N.-type organization can do as
well as any other."
Richard Henderson, California, '55
—"I don't think the U.N. is strong
enough. Until there is a world police
force nothing can be accomplished."
Jack Iloagland, California, '57—
"No, because as long as each nation
is hesitant to equally participate in
the U.N. with an unselfish attitude
toward further world peace, the or
ganization cannot succeed."
Jim Howat, California, '55—"1 don't
feel that we have peace now. How

can we protect something that we I
don't have?"
Joyce Hupp, California, '54—"The ,
U.N. has done enough worthwhile !
things in other fields so that it's
worth keeping on trying. You can't
expect perfect peace."
Ray Looney, Idaho, '57—"No, be- j
cause I don't believe that the CortS
munistic countries will abide by j
written or oral agreements set up by i
the U.N. when it comes to a show- ;
down."
Briggitte Maldidier, France, Grad
—"I think that the U.N. is not able to
change the relations between the
states which are based upon a bal
ance of power. The U.N. is mainly a

world rostrum which disunited na
tions use to express their disagree
ments."
Ed IMunn, California, '57—"Yes, if
Russia stays in. If Russia were not;
in the U.N., the organization would
lose its value."

only as healthy or as sick as the in
dividuals who make it up, and all

the matter. The remedy is that of

the world will be reformed.'"
Mary Sherman, Maryland, 'sfi—"l
don't think that the U.N. is strong

thing should be done about the veto."

gression."

Katherine Thalberg, California. '56
"The U.N. is a fine tiling and should J

be able to protect the peace."
Neil Walker, Hawaii, '56—"No,
they haven't yet. They aren't strong
enough. I suggest that the U.N. let
Communist China in as a separate
nation in the assembly where they
have no voting or veto power. Keep
Formosa in the Security Council."
Marion Winn, Texas, '57—"If the

of the U.N., then it ought to be able
to protect the peace."
Jim Woodhead, Minnesota, '56—

"Can the United Nations pro
tect the peace?"
According to the results of an
informal poll conducted by The
Daily on campus this week, few
Stanford students think that any
world organization can offer a
positive guarantee of peace, but
almost all of them do think that
the U.N. performs a valuable
function.
The class and home state of the
students quoted are included to indi
cate the portion of the student body
represented in the poll.
The following people had this to
say:
Jean Gotschall, Tokyo, '57—"Fun
damentally the U.N. can only protect
the peace if all its members earnestly
try."
Shannon Ileath, California, 's(s—"lf
it is possible to protect the peace, the
U.N.-type organization can do as
well as any other."
Richard Henderson, California, '55
—"I don't think the U.N. is strong
enough. Until there is a world police
force nothing can be accomplished."
Jack Iloagland, California, '57—
"No, because as long as each nation
is hesitant to equally participate in
the U.N. with an unselfish attitude
toward further world peace, the or
ganization cannot succeed."
Jim Howat, California, '55—"1 don't
feel that we have peace now. How

can we protect something that we I
don't have?"
Joyce Hupp, California, '54—"The ,
U.N. has done enough worthwhile !
things in other fields so that it's
worth keeping on trying. You can't
expect perfect peace."
Ray Looney, Idaho, '57—"No, be- j
cause I don't believe that the CortS
munistic countries will abide by j
written or oral agreements set up by i
the U.N. when it comes to a show- ;
down."
Briggitte Maldidier, France, Grad
—"I think that the U.N. is not able to
change the relations between the
states which are based upon a bal
ance of power. The U.N. is mainly a

world rostrum which disunited na
tions use to express their disagree
ments."
Ed IMunn, California, '57—"Yes, if
Russia stays in. If Russia were not;
in the U.N., the organization would
lose its value."
Chole Owens, California, '55—"1

Mary Sherman, Maryland, 'sfi—"l
don't think that the U.N. is strong

thing should be done about the veto."
John Sill, California, '55 — "I
frankly think that another war is
inevitable. The U.N. doesn't seem to
have the power to stop Russian ag- i
gression."
Kd Sing, California, '54—"1 don't
think so. Their word doesn't seem to
mean anything to anyone who is
serious about waging a war."
Mary Lou Smith, California, '54—
"There is need for an organization
which permits nations to work to
gether; perhaps the U.N. is this or- j
ganization; perhaps it isn't.
Katherine Thalberg, California. '56
"The U.N. is a fine tiling and should J

be able to protect the peace."
Neil Walker, Hawaii, '56—"No,
they haven't yet. They aren't strong
enough. I suggest that the U.N. let
Communist China in as a separate
nation in the assembly where they
have no voting or veto power. Keep
Formosa in the Security Council."
Marion Winn, Texas, '57—"If the
member nations abide by the rules
of the U.N., then it ought to be able
to protect the peace."
Jim Woodhead, Minnesota, '56—
"Yes, through proper co-operation
of each of the members, specifically
