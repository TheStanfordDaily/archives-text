# Student Police Crack Down On Sunday Movie Sneak-ins
## 
### 
Mike Zeiler, manager of Sunday
Night Movies, declared Tuesday that
two more police were on duty la I.
Sunday in an attempt to crack down
on "sneak-ins."
Zeiler felt that the situation was
improving despite the fact that a
few students were caught attempt
ing to sneak into Sunday's movie,
"Gentlemen's Agreement."
Since plenty of seats were available
last Sunday, it was difficult to esti
mate the number of sneak-ins who
in the past have forced people to sit
in the aisles.
The expanded police force will be
continued this Sunday when the
show will be "People Will Talk. '
starring Jeanne Crain and Cary
Grant.
