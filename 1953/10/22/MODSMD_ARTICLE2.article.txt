## Israel Bucks U.N. Orders, Continues Jordan Project 
### 
TEL AVIV, Oct. 21 (UP) â€”The Israeli Government has ignored a
United States economic setback and a United Nations cease work
order and voted to continue developing a controversial Jordan
River water power and irrigation project, informed sources said
today.
The cabinet voted, 8 to 3, with one abstention, to support Prime

Minister David Ben-Gurion's refus-"
al to halt work on the project to
channel ofT waters of the Jordan
River, the sources said.
The United Nations truce super
visor for Palestine, Maj. Gen. Vaugn
Bennike, had ordered Israel to stop
work on the project because of
strong Syrian objections to the pro-
Thc government voted with full
prior knowledge that the United
States had announced it would
withhold further American aid to
Israel unless the United Nations
order was obeyed.
Stoppage of American aid could
cause serious disruption of Israel's
economy and result in severe
shortages of food and consumer
goods.
Israel last year received $65,000,-
000 in American aid and officials in
Washington had estimated a similar
amount would be advanced this
year.
Israel's plan to build a hydro
electric plant on the Jordan has re
newed friction between the Jewish
national state and her Arab neigh
bors. It also has caused the United
States to withhold dollar aid to Is
rael under the foreign aid program.
The Israeli embassy, in a policy
statement, denied that Israel is
defying the United Nations. It
said the entire aaflir lias been
placed before the U.N. Security
Council and added that no water
is now actually being diverted
from the Jordan Iliver.
U.S. diplomatic officials said they
welcomed the embassy statement.
They intimated that this country
might renew economic aid payments
1o Israel if that country proves be
fore the U.N. that it has done no
harm.
