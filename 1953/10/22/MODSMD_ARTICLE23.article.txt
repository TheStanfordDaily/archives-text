# Building Today for Tomorrow
## 
### 
Eight years ago the United Nations organi
zation came into being.
And still today the future of that organiza
tion is a guestion-mark in the minds of most
of the world's peoples.
In the United States critics are noisily de
manding that:
1. The U.S. drop out of the U.N.
2. The U.S. force Russia and her satellites
out of the U.N.
3. The U.N. charter be drastically revised.
And some people seem to be recommending
all three courses at one and the same time.
According to the informal poll published in
today's Daily, Stanford students by and large
are skeptical of any such cure-all solutions for
the world's ills. Almost everyone guestioned
seemed to believe that the present U.N. sys
tem of compromise after discussion is the best
—although by no means a sure-fire—method
to secure peace in the world. Few students
were tempted to blame the present break-down
in the world's collective security system on
the U.N.; most realized that we have war in the
world today because the world's nations refuse
to make proper use of the U.N.'s facilities.
It's encouraging that students know so well

that today's U.N. is only, as one interviewee
phrased it, "a means to a better U.N." Egually
encouraging is the stress that almost everyone
placed on the sometimes hard-to-see values in
the U.N.—its long-range social and economic
programs, its function as a world public opin
ion forum, its progress "toward building up a
habit of co-operation among the world's peo
ple.
The U.N. is essentially today's way to build
leaders may be for that tomorrow, however
leaders may be for that tomorrow, however
guick they may be to jump at any guick and
easy solution suggested, what counts is that
we, the students who will have to live in that
tomorrow, know how to wait for it and work
for it.
If today's poll is a fair sample, Stanford stu
dents know that the world of peace promised
to us in 1945 is still a long way off. But we're
more than willing to go along with the or
ganization that offers us our only chance to
realize it in 1955 or 1965 or some day. In a
hurry? Sure, we are. But we know that a slow
step now may save us years of tragedy in
the future. And we're willing, to wait.—Bar

placed on the sometimes hard-to-see values in
the U.N.—its long-range social and economic
programs, its function as a world public opin

leaders may be for that tomorrow, however
guick they may be to jump at any guick and
easy solution suggested, what counts is that
we, the students who will have to live in that
tomorrow, know how to wait for it and work
for it.
If today's poll is a fair sample, Stanford stu
dents know that the world of peace promised
to us in 1945 is still a long way off. But we're
more than willing to go along with the or
ganization that offers us our only chance to
realize it in 1955 or 1965 or some day. In a
hurry? Sure, we are. But we know that a slow
step now may save us years of tragedy in
the future. And we're willing, to wait.—Bar

Eight years ago the United Nations organi
zation came into being.
And still today the future of that organiza
tion is a guestion-mark in the minds of most
of the world's peoples.
In the United States critics are noisily de
manding that:
1. The U.S. drop out of the U.N.
2. The U.S. force Russia and her satellites
out of the U.N.
3. The U.N. charter be drastically revised.
And some people seem to be recommending
all three courses at one and the same time.
According to the informal poll published in
today's Daily, Stanford students by and large
are skeptical of any such cure-all solutions for
the world's ills. Almost everyone guestioned
seemed to believe that the present U.N. sys
tem of compromise after discussion is the best
—although by no means a sure-fire—method
to secure peace in the world. Few students
were tempted to blame the present break-down
in the world's collective security system on
the U.N.; most realized that we have war in the
world today because the world's nations refuse
to make proper use of the U.N.'s facilities.
It's encouraging that students know so well

that today's U.N. is only, as one interviewee
phrased it, "a means to a better U.N." Egually
encouraging is the stress that almost everyone
placed on the sometimes hard-to-see values in

ion forum, its progress "toward building up a
