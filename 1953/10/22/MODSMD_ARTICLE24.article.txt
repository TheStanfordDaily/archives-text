JOINT STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE CHAIRMEN
OF THE STANFORD YOUNG REPUBLICANS
AND THE YOUNG DEMOCRATS IN THE
STANFORD AREA
To the Editor:
We take pride in joining with thoughtful Americans
everywhere who are this week reaffirming their
support for the principles and program of the United
Nations.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower has said:
"What we need most—and first—to give the UN
needed strength is to believe in it. I happen to be
lieve in it with my whole heart. I cannot overstate
my desire to see (he United Nations made stronger,

to see it win more people to its support and to a
greater determination for the practice of the prin
ciples it lays down."
We join the President in an expression of faith that
the great lessons of the past fifty years have shown
the American people the vital need of supporting and
building the United Nations which is rightly called
"our last best hope for peace."
