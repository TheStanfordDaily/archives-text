# ASSU Blood Bank Marks Progress of Health Com
## 
### RUTH WOLPE DARRELL BURNS 
An ASSU blood bank. Whole
blood available to Stanford stu
dents in case of emergency.
This is one of the major accom
plishments of the Stanford Stu
dent Health Committee.
The Student Health Committee
was instituted five years ago on
the suggestion of the director of
the Health Service, Dr. George
i H. Houek. Since then the commit
tee has served as an intermediary
: between the students and the Health
j Service.

Interviews for membership on
the Student Health Committee
will be held downstairs in the
Women's Clubhouse from 4:.'{0 to
5:30 p.m. today and from to
4:.'{0 p.m. toomrrow.

The members of the committee
bring to the attention of the Health
Service doctors the students' sug
gestions and complaints.
Dr. Houck, though not an official
member of the health committee,
serves as a source of information
and inspiration.
A c c or d in g to Jack Valpey,
chairman of the committee, the
group's most important achieve
ment has been the elimination of
the signed certificate of illness
previously required as an excuse
for absence.
Excuses now come under the

Hopor Code and the student's word
is accepted by the faculty.
Stanford students traveling
abroad last summer found the es
tablishment of a series of immuni
zation shots both necessary and

convenient. The committee was re
sponsible for making this service
possible.
During the recent flu epidemic,
the committee was instrumental in
publicizing the availability of vac
cine and helped to reduce the num
ber of students hit by the virus.
The committee is still trying to
solve the problem of inadequate
medical offices and the absence

, of an infirmary on campus. At
' present a letter is being written
to J. E. Wallace Sterling. Univer
sity president, outlining the situ
ation and its possible solution.
The committee's major concern
this quarter is with the number one
J health problem on campus: injury.
The health committee suggested
the creation ol a standing committee
i for the investigation and prevention
of injury on campus. This was
brought before the ASSU Executive
Committee and a standing commit
i tee has since been established.
One of the purposes of this
standing committee is to make
students aware of the existing
problem and to acquaint them
with the dangers of negligence.
The creation of this committee,
the establishment of the bloqd bank,
and the elimination of signed ill
ness certificates are concrete exam
ples of student initiative and the
work that the Student Health Com
mittee has done.
