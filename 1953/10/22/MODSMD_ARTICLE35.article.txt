# Bobby Garrett Is Nation's Top 'Back of the Week'
## 
### 
Bobby Garrett's sterling performance against UCLA Saturday
earned him the nation's "Back of the Week" award by both the
AP and UP news services.
Other big news from the gridiron yesterday was the announce
ment that fullback Bill Wentworth would be ready to go Saturday.

The hard - running senior worked'*
out in pads, despite the pinched
nerve injury he suffered.
Taylor sent the squad through a '
brisk two - hour workout, turning
on the. lights for the last half-hour.
The emphasis was on blocking, al
though there was no contact. Bob
by Garrett loosened up his pitching
arm in a passing drill as he expect
ed to throw often Saturday at Se
attle.
The Cards also worked on defen
sive signals and finished practice
with wind sprints. Tackle Dick
Gant, who came in for much praise
off his UCLA performance, has been
moved into Barry Smith's first
string tackle slot.
Smith was working out in sweat
clothes and said he felt fine while
he was active, but that inactivity
gave him headaches.
Chuck Taylor came out with the
statement yesterday that he was in
favor of the elimination of the extra
point. He thought it put too much
pressure on one boy.
Report from Washington was that
it has been raining lightly this week,
but the new Washington Stadium
has been covered with a tarpaulin.
