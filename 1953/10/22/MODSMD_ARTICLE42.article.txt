# Daily Sports Predictions

Although three of Tlie Daily's
seemingly rational but eventually
surprised forecasters tabbed UCLA
to win last week, the sports scrib
blers out-picked opponents Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler,
Chuck Taylor, and Norm Manoogian
in the first weekly prognostications.
Led by the courageous eenie
meenie-minie-moe methods of Don
Stephens, who called all the games
correctly, the Dippy deskmen rank
up an .850 accuracy average while
their foes had a combined average
of .733.
This week the head Dope-ster,
Mike Hudson, is again going out on
the limb by predicting a Georgia
Tech win over the Irish of Notre
Dame.
