# President's UA Message
## 
### 
Stanford and other educational
institutions have a special oppor
tunity to put into practice the
ideals of United Nations Day.
We have the opportunity in
classroom and campus life to be
come thoroughly acquainted with
the countries of the world and
their peoples. Only with this
knowledge can we obtain the un
derstanding on which peaceful
existence must be based.
Available to all are the numer
ous and effective organized activi
ties, coming largely under the
head of your Institute of Interna
tional Relations. In addition we
can learn much from informal
contacts with the. many students
here from foreign countries.
I urge each of you to take the
fullest possible advantage of these
opportunities. This is an individ
ual responsibility, for the United
Nations is not a vague obligation
of universities or nations or any
groups of people, but an instru
ment of the will and knowledge
of each o*' us.
J. E. WALLACE STERLING
