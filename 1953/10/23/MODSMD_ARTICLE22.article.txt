# Indians to Clash with Huskies in Northwest
## Garrett to Lead Gridders In Crucial Tilt Tomorrow 
### RUSS WILKS 
The Greatest Show on Earth, Stanford's aerial circus under tlio
direction of ringmaster Bob Garrett, will set up tent in Seatllo
tomorrow afternoon at 2 wheij the Cards attempt to tame the
Washington Huskies.
Master showman Chuck Taylor earlier this week guaranteed

that the vaunted Indian passing
attack would be on display
come rain or shine.
Garrett, whose national stock
soared sky high as a result of his
brilliant performance against UC
LA, has his work cut out for him.

t' less about his number
one ranking in the Pacific Coast
Conference and his number two
ranking in the national passing de
partment.
All that Washington knows is that
it has the top pass defense in the
league, having 13 pass inter
ceptions. Guard Jim Noe ranks sec
ond in the loop with three inter
ceptions.
The conference game is crucial
for both teams. Stanford with ;»
3-0 mark must win to keep on the
Rose Bowl track, and Washington
with a two win and one tie rec
ord would loom as a strong con
tender with a victory.
Coach Johnny Cher berg thinks
that his Huskies are strong con
tenders as a result of a fast pick-up
after a very poor start. Washington
opened the season by losing to me
diocre Colorado, 21-20, and in the
process lost the services for the sea
son of star backs Mike Monroe and
Bill Albrccht. Monroe scored two
touchdowns before suffering a bro
ken wrist.
Last week Oregon provided a stiff
test, but with backs Jack Kyllinu
stad and Bob McNamee running in
high gear the Huskies once again
prevailed, winning 14-6.
Potentially Washington has a
team of Rose Bowl caliber, and
that potential is being realized.
The strong point has been in
their defensive play since the
Michigan game. In their last three
tilts the Huskies' opponents have
averaged less than 140 yards in
passing and rushing.
The hard - charging line of ends
Jim Houston and Jim Warsinske,
tackles Duane Wardiow and Dean
Chambers, and guards Milt Bohart
and Jim Noe held the mighty Troy
to four first downs. The vicious
tackling by this group caused nine
Trojan fumbles. Bohart was select
ed lineman of the week after play
ing 60 minutes' rugged football
against SC.
The Huskies also think they have
the answer to Garrett in sophomore
quarterback Sandy Ledcrman. Le
derman has shaken off early-season
jitters and is right on Garrett's tail
for conference passing laurels. The
185-pound signal caller has com
pleted 42 passes in 95 attempts for a
percentage of .442 and has thrown

I wo scoring tosses while packing Uie
ball for one tally himself. He is
fourth in the nation.
Lederman's favorite receivers are
ends Warsinske and Doug "Stork"
McClary. Warsinske has grabbed
nine passes for 91 yards, while the
(i-l't. 8-in. basketball-playing Mc-
Clary has accepted six aerials for 73
yards.

The Greatest Show on Earth, Stanford's aerial circus under tlio
direction of ringmaster Bob Garrett, will set up tent in Seatllo
tomorrow afternoon at 2 wheij the Cards attempt to tame the
Washington Huskies.
Master showman Chuck Taylor earlier this week guaranteed

that the vaunted Indian passing
attack would be on display
come rain or shine.
Garrett, whose national stock
soared sky high as a result of his
brilliant performance against UC
LA, has his work cut out for him.
The Huskies aren't interested in the
fact that he was £ho nation's out-

standing "Back of the Week" and
t' less about his number
one ranking in the Pacific Coast
Conference and his number two
ranking in the national passing de
partment.
All that Washington knows is that
it has the top pass defense in the
league, having 13 pass inter
ceptions. Guard Jim Noe ranks sec
ond in the loop with three inter
ceptions.
The conference game is crucial
for both teams. Stanford with ;»
3-0 mark must win to keep on the
Rose Bowl track, and Washington
with a two win and one tie rec
ord would loom as a strong con
tender with a victory.
Coach Johnny Cher berg thinks
that his Huskies are strong con
tenders as a result of a fast pick-up
after a very poor start. Washington
opened the season by losing to me
diocre Colorado, 21-20, and in the
process lost the services for the sea
son of star backs Mike Monroe and
Bill Albrccht. Monroe scored two
touchdowns before suffering a bro
ken wrist.
Last week Oregon provided a stiff
test, but with backs Jack Kyllinu
stad and Bob McNamee running in
high gear the Huskies once again
prevailed, winning 14-6.
Potentially Washington has a
team of Rose Bowl caliber, and
that potential is being realized.
The strong point has been in
their defensive play since the
Michigan game. In their last three
tilts the Huskies' opponents have
averaged less than 140 yards in
passing and rushing.
The hard - charging line of ends
Jim Houston and Jim Warsinske,
tackles Duane Wardiow and Dean
Chambers, and guards Milt Bohart
and Jim Noe held the mighty Troy
to four first downs. The vicious
tackling by this group caused nine
Trojan fumbles. Bohart was select
ed lineman of the week after play
ing 60 minutes' rugged football
against SC.
The Huskies also think they have
the answer to Garrett in sophomore
quarterback Sandy Ledcrman. Le
derman has shaken off early-season
jitters and is right on Garrett's tail
for conference passing laurels. The
185-pound signal caller has com
pleted 42 passes in 95 attempts for a
percentage of .442 and has thrown
