# With a Cautious Hope

Though realizing points of possible weak
ness, Executive Committee members Wednes
day night, after a week of conscientious study
and contact with constituents, moved to enroll
this University for a second time in the ranks
of the National Students Association.
They realized that past experience with the
organization was not satisfactory or rewarding.
And they realized that, particularly along
the West Coast, the association is still a young
organization and conseguently somewhat
weak.
But looking beyond these points? they saw
promise in the organization promise that
Stanford, along with the other member schools
of the association, through concerted action,
could conceivably make manifest.
They saw the challenge that a new organiza
tion offers.
They saw significance in the three primary
aims of the organization: (1) service to students;
(2) a voice for students nationally; (3) a voice
for students internationally.
They saw the benefits that this campus might
receive from membership; and perhaps more
importantly, they saw information and help
that Stanford could possibly offer other schools
through NSA channels.
And the promise they envisaged gave new
weight to their deliberations.
Their resultant decision for re-entry, a sur
prise to many, including this paper, seemed
honestly and conscientiously arrived at.
It was not a hasty decision. Nor were the
members of Excom carried away on a rosy
cloud.
They merely put the aims of NSA into a
hopeful perspective.
Each voting member of the committee re
ported how—in an attempt to frame his own

decision —he had tried to evaluate the senti
ment of his constituency, either by polling as
large a group of students as possible or by
talking with various class and dormitory ex
ecutive committees.
Some Excom members said their conversa
tions "with constituents were unsatisfactory,
that those students with whom they talked
were most apathetic and disinterested in NSA.
But this, surprisingly, at least to us, was by
no means the general case. Most of the repre
sentatives reported that discussions held in
living groups and elsewhere were, on the
whole, intelligent and sober, and that most stu
dents seemed interested though cautious about
membership in the national organization.
If an average opinion can be deduced from
the reports given Excom, it woirld seem that
most students favor trial membership in the
association subject to critical review at the
end of a year. This was the view adopted by
Excom Wednesday night.
Of course, in taking the step, Excom was
sorely aware of many difficulties attached to
NSA, the foremost being that of selecting en
thusiastic and co-operative students to run the
local program. Apparently one of the more
pressing handicaps when the University be
longed to NSA three years ago v/as the guality
of the organization's leadership on campus.
The students in general and the Excom and
the ASSU boards and committees in particular,
having seen the promise of NSA, are cautious
ly expectant and watchful.
They feel, as apparently a week ago they did
not, that membership is worth a try.
We think that Excom members acted in good
faith with their constituents and that, therefore,
NSA should be given a complete and fair trial
on this campus.
