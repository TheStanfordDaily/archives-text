This is why wo voted lor joining the NSA. Wo wore faced with the prob
lem ol deciding whether or not Stanford should affiliate with the NSA.
Many of us are not sure that the affiliation is desirable; indeed some of us
tend to feel that the affiliation will not be satisfactory. However, after
listening to many opinions on the value of .such affiliation, after reading
much, about the association, and after gathering as much student opinion
(in the question, we felt that in order for Stanford to make as honest a de
< i ion us possible we should give ourselves the opportunity of seeing how
our affiliation would work.
The decision that we made Wednesday night was not an endorsement of |
NSA; rather an endorsement of the policy of trying to fairly and j
honestly evaluate NSA.
We' should like to add that we feel, in order to make this evaluation
valid, that the student body and the members of the student government !
should support the NSA program on our campus as best we can during j
the next year.
