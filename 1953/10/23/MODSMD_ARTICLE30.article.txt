# Unbeaten Brave Gridders Play TI Here Tomorrow
## 
### 
The Stanford Braves, unbeaten in
three starts, will attempt to extend
their perfect record at the expense
of a strong Treasure Island Navy
team in Stanford Stadium Saturday
afternoon. Game time is set for 2
p.m., and admission is free.
Coach Mai Elward reports that the
Braves will enter the stadium with
their roster at its lowest ebb of the
season, with the annexation of two
more of their starters by the varsity
tackle John Ludekp and halfback
Dick Crepeau. Both boys will make
the varsity trip to Seattle.
Although the Braves have relied
mainly on their ground game to
maintain their spotless record, Coach
Elward hinted that .they may "mix
it up" with some aerial plays on Sat
urday. It could be that a pitch off the
arm of quarterback Jerry Gustafson
that hit end Jim McCamant on the
button for a scoring play covering
!5. r > yards in last week's Moffett Field
liamu had something to do with the
decision.
Jack Rannells will team with Mc-

Camant at the end spots, with Bob
Birkie and John Sevier at the tack
les. Sevier is a guard, converted to
take the promoted John Ludeke's
spot. Walt Eagle and Tony Mosich
will hold down the guard positions
and center Don Geddes will com
plete the forward wall for Stanford.
Jerry Gustafson and Jack Lewis
will call the signals and do the pitch
ing for the Braves. Phil Backer at
left half, Dorsey Atkinson at right, j
and Don Day at fullback round out
the backfield.
Treasure Island will come to the
Farm fresh from a 7-G triumph over
the Cal Ramblers. But if comparative
scores indicate anything, the Braves
should assume the favorite role.
They earlier topped the Cal J.V.
club by a 12-6 count.
The Treasure Island club this year
is minus the services of two of their
last year's stars, a quarterback-end j
passing combination. But bolstering
up their line from a guard spot is
Jim McKenna, a brother of Tom,
the Card's varsity center.

season, with the annexation of two
more of their starters by the varsity
tackle John Ludekp and halfback
Dick Crepeau. Both boys will make
the varsity trip to Seattle.
Although the Braves have relied
mainly on their ground game to
maintain their spotless record, Coach
Elward hinted that .they may "mix
it up" with some aerial plays on Sat
urday. It could be that a pitch off the
arm of quarterback Jerry Gustafson
that hit end Jim McCamant on the
button for a scoring play covering
!5. r > yards in last week's Moffett Field
liamu had something to do with the
decision.
Jack Rannells will team with Mc-

Camant at the end spots, with Bob
Birkie and John Sevier at the tack
les. Sevier is a guard, converted to
take the promoted John Ludeke's
spot. Walt Eagle and Tony Mosich
will hold down the guard positions
and center Don Geddes will com
plete the forward wall for Stanford.
Jerry Gustafson and Jack Lewis
will call the signals and do the pitch
ing for the Braves. Phil Backer at
left half, Dorsey Atkinson at right, j
and Don Day at fullback round out
the backfield.
Treasure Island will come to the
Farm fresh from a 7-G triumph over
the Cal Ramblers. But if comparative
scores indicate anything, the Braves
should assume the favorite role.
They earlier topped the Cal J.V.
club by a 12-6 count.
The Treasure Island club this year
is minus the services of two of their
last year's stars, a quarterback-end j
passing combination. But bolstering
up their line from a guard spot is
Jim McKenna, a brother of Tom,
the Card's varsity center.
The Stanford Braves, unbeaten in
three starts, will attempt to extend
their perfect record at the expense
of a strong Treasure Island Navy
team in Stanford Stadium Saturday
afternoon. Game time is set for 2
p.m., and admission is free.
Coach Mai Elward reports that the
Braves will enter the stadium with
their roster at its lowest ebb of the
season, with the annexation of two
more of their starters by the varsity
tackle John Ludekp and halfback
Dick Crepeau. Both boys will make
the varsity trip to Seattle.
