## 
### CLAUDE LAVAL 
Bob Garrett, outstanding Stan- i
ford quarterback, whose strong arm j
and heady play - calling upset the j
highly vaunted UCLA grid machine
last Saturday, was unanimously se- j
lected as Daily Athlete of the Week
yesterday.
Simultaneously, the Associated I
and United Press Associations j
named the six-loot one-inch senior
from San Marino as national back
of the week.
It was Garrett's "unconscious"
passing attack that brought the
Indians from a 20-1 third-quarter
deficit to eventual victory over
the Bruins, who last week were

rated fourth nationally. During
his second - half TD - hound
marches, he completed 11 of I I
attempted passes for llfj yards.
His performance against the
Bruins, which football authorities
j ranked as one of the greatest ever
turned in. by a Stanford gridder,
put him out in front in PCC pass
ing statistics and also made him the
second leading passer in the nation.
He completed 18 out of 27 passes
against UCLA for 19(i yards.
Garrett's two receivers, Sam Mor
ley and John Steinberg, by virtue
of their outstanding performance
1 against the southlanders, jumped
into first and second places, respec-

I tively, in PCC pass receptions,
During their hi,<jh school career
at South Pasadena High, Morley
i was Garrett's favorite target, as
he was Saturday when the blond
econ major hit him for nine com
pletions, just one short of the con
ference record for •receptions in/
one game.
Possibly the biggest compliment
to Garrett's performance came from
UCLA Coach "Red" Sanders after
the game. "1 have never seen,'' he
was quoted as saying, "a game so
dominated by one man. I have nev
er even heard of one man in a sin
gle half doing what Garrett con
trived to do to us today."

one game.
Possibly the biggest compliment
to Garrett's performance came from
UCLA Coach "Red" Sanders after
the game. "1 have never seen,'' he
was quoted as saying, "a game so
dominated by one man. I have nev
er even heard of one man in a sin
gle half doing what Garrett con
trived to do to us today."
