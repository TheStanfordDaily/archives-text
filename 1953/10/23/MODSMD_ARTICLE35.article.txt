A safety midway through the sec
ond half gave El Capitan a 2-0 vic
tory over El Toro in intramural

End Jim Larson broke through
the line to catch an El Toro back
behind the goal and break a score

line.
El Toro dorrfinated first-half play,
driving to the Capitan 12- and then
live-yard line before being stopped.
On the drive to the live-yard line
El Toro scored on an aerial, but they
were penalized lor backfield in mo
tion and the play was nullified. Only
once in the initial half did the Capi

the period they had El Toro with
their backs to the goal on a fourth
down and 54 yards to go for a first
down. Three pass interceptions by
the Toro backfield stopped any Ca
pitan offensive march in the opening
half.
The Capitan offense began to roll
in the second half. One drive was
halted on the 10-yard line before
El Capitan scored the safety. The*
