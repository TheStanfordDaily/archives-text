"Safari as I'm concerned" said Sheedy's gal, "your hair looks like some
tiling the cat dragged in. Purrhaps you better spring for some Wildroot
Cream-Oil, America's favorite hair tonic. Keeps hair combed without
greasiness. Removes loose, ugly dandruff". Relieves an- /njn
noying dryness. Contains Lanolin. Non-alcoholic." So /v
Sheedy roared down to his druggist for Wildroot
Cream-Oil, and now lie's feline mighty fine. All the girls
paws and stare when he passes. So yon better leopard on
the bandwagon and try Wildroot Cream-Oil right meow.
