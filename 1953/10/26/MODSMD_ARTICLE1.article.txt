## ASSU Drives Committee Starts WUS Collection 
### 
ASSU Drives Committee will begin its efforts this morning to solicit contributions to World
University Service and a fund for an additional ASSU foreign scholarship.
The first SBOO collected in the Fall Drive will be used to establish an additional scholarship to
be administered by the Foreign Scholarship Committee. All other collections will be forwarded
to World University Service, the agency through which universities in all parts of the world ex
change aid and information.
All students will be contacted by solicitors through their campus living groups or off-campus

homes. Members of the staff
and faculty will be contacted
by mail.
Bob Gable, chairman of the
drive, has emphasized that the
committee will attempt to reach
as many potential donors as pos
sible. He has announced that so
liciting teams will cover residen
tial areas in communities border
ing Stanford as well as the cam
pus itself.
Ed Ardzrooni, treasurer of the
drive, has requested that solicitors
turn in contributions at the end of
each day's collection. The drive's
office, in the YWCA oflice on the
third floor of the Women's Club -
house, will be open from 4 to 5:ii0
each afternoon from today until
Friday.
Chairman Gable, commenting on
the primary purpose of the drive,
has said this of World University
Service:
"The main theme of WUS is to
help students to help themselves.
This can be accomplished if the
students in one country help sup
ply the equipment and suppljes
desperately needed by the stu
dents in a less fortunate country.
"The hope of World University
Service is that through its work
young men and women in all coun
tries will have a chance to become
educated leaders of their communi
ties. With these leaders, leaders
who have been helped by World
University Service, the chances for
a world of peace and understanding
will be raised."
