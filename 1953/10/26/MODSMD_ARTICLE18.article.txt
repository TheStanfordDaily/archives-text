SEATTLE, Oct. 24—Stanford punched hard and fast to score two quick touchdowns, then hung
on to grab a 13-7 win over Washington here today. "We were extremely lucky," was the first
thing Coach Chuck Taylor said to reporters after the game.
He could have added that the country's best pass-and-catch combo, Bob Garrett to Sam Morley
or John Steinberg, was extremely skillful. Garrett scared the beejeebers out of 40,000 Washing
ton partisans every time he attempted a pass, which was 23 times. He completed 12 passes, 10
of them in the first half.
While Garrett gunned passes to his ends, Ron Cook also did a little gunning. The Redondo

ceacn speedster returned a punt
52 yards for a TD in the first pe
riod and rambled 35 yards for
six more points on a pass from Gar
rett in the second quarter.
The second half was unpleasant
to the few hundred scattered Card
supporters. Suffice it to say thai
the Injuns gave up one score,
fumbled badly, were "living right"
several times, and battled in t in
best Indian tradition in a game
saving goal-line stand.
Johnny Cherberg, the new Husky
coach, who has the Washington
alumni applauding, said after thn
game that "Stanford, as far as the
first 11 men go, is as good aSi USC."
He said Card reserves were not ,
strong. He should know, since the
Huskies have played both SC and
Stanford.
was strictly schizophre
nic, a.I i.cm the first 30 minutes, all
Purple and Gold the last half.
It was Garrett's air arm that
carried Stanford ahead in spec
tacular bursts. Washington man
aged to stop two early drives, but
Cook returned a Hob Dunn punt
51 yards for the Injuns' first score.
Not a Husky touched him as key
blocks by anonymous but efficient
Stanford linemen cleared his path.
Garrett converted, 7-0.
Garrett continued his passing as
sault first to Morley, then Steinberv,
but Washington held. Then Garrett,
a defensive whiz, intercepted on the
Washington 42. He completed three
in a row, the last to Cook for 15
yards and a score. Arne Bergli
blocked the conversion try.
Came the second half and Wash
ington's rooting section made a;»
much racket as they ever have in
recent history as the Huskies bat
tled Stanford off their feet.
Sandy Lederman, Washington's
soph quarterback from Santa
Monica, started to hit with Gar
rctt-like accuracy. He switched
to short, sharp passes in the sec
ond half, instead of long and wild
! heaves.
Midway through the third period
a terrific drive saw Sandy complet
ing four for five and a first down on
Stanford's 10-yard line. Qn the next
play fullback Jack Nugent scam
pered over Stanford's left side for
;i touchdown. Wendell Niles con
verted.
Meanwhile Garrett was rushed
very badly, and the runners could
n't move for fumbling. The crowd
was roaring as the teams exchanged
punts and then Washington, with
Lederman pitching and Ed Sage
running, took advantage of a fum
ble? and moved down to the Stan
ford eight. Brothers Manoogian,
Wilson, Tanner, and Co. stopped
three plays cold, a pass went^wild,

I and Stanford took over.
After a punt. Lederman failed
I hack at inidfield and hit George
Black, the 15)52 villain at Stanford.
The speedy guy went all the way
for the score that would have
made it But a backfield in
motion penalty nullified it.
The game ended in a bizarre ex
change of Stanford fumbles recov
ered by Washington and Washing
ton passes intercepted by Stanford,
j Stanford intercepted six of Leder
man's 29 passes.
Final statistics show how close it
was. Stanford gained 218 yards
rushing and passing, all but 56 via
passing, while Washington gained
201.

SEATTLE, Oct. 24—Stanford punched hard and fast to score two quick touchdowns, then hung
on to grab a 13-7 win over Washington here today. "We were extremely lucky," was the first
thing Coach Chuck Taylor said to reporters after the game.
He could have added that the country's best pass-and-catch combo, Bob Garrett to Sam Morley
or John Steinberg, was extremely skillful. Garrett scared the beejeebers out of 40,000 Washing
ton partisans every time he attempted a pass, which was 23 times. He completed 12 passes, 10
of them in the first half.
While Garrett gunned passes to his ends, Ron Cook also did a little gunning. The Redondo

ceacn speedster returned a punt
52 yards for a TD in the first pe
riod and rambled 35 yards for
six more points on a pass from Gar
rett in the second quarter.
The second half was unpleasant
to the few hundred scattered Card

the Injuns gave up one score,
fumbled badly, were "living right"
several times, and battled in t in

SEATTLE, Oct. 24—Stanford punched hard and fast to score two quick touchdowns, then hung
on to grab a 13-7 win over Washington here today. "We were extremely lucky," was the first
thing Coach Chuck Taylor said to reporters after the game.
He could have added that the country's best pass-and-catch combo, Bob Garrett to Sam Morley
or John Steinberg, was extremely skillful. Garrett scared the beejeebers out of 40,000 Washing
ton partisans every time he attempted a pass, which was 23 times. He completed 12 passes, 10
of them in the first half.
While Garrett gunned passes to his ends, Ron Cook also did a little gunning. The Redondo

ceacn speedster returned a punt
52 yards for a TD in the first pe
riod and rambled 35 yards for
six more points on a pass from Gar
rett in the second quarter.
The second half was unpleasant
to the few hundred scattered Card
supporters. Suffice it to say thai
the Injuns gave up one score,
fumbled badly, were "living right"
several times, and battled in t in
best Indian tradition in a game
saving goal-line stand.
Johnny Cherberg, the new Husky
coach, who has the Washington
alumni applauding, said after thn
game that "Stanford, as far as the
first 11 men go, is as good aSi USC."
He said Card reserves were not ,
strong. He should know, since the
Huskies have played both SC and
Stanford.

It was Garrett's air arm that
carried Stanford ahead in spec
tacular bursts. Washington man
aged to stop two early drives, but
Cook returned a Hob Dunn punt
51 yards for the Injuns' first score.
Not a Husky touched him as key

Stanford linemen cleared his path.
Garrett converted, 7-0.
Garrett continued his passing as
sault first to Morley, then Steinberv,
but Washington held. Then Garrett,
a defensive whiz, intercepted on the
Washington 42. He completed three
in a row, the last to Cook for 15
yards and a score. Arne Bergli
blocked the conversion try.
Came the second half and Wash
ington's rooting section made a;»
much racket as they ever have in
recent history as the Huskies bat
tled Stanford off their feet.
Sandy Lederman, Washington's
soph quarterback from Santa
Monica, started to hit with Gar
rctt-like accuracy. He switched
to short, sharp passes in the sec
ond half, instead of long and wild

Meanwhile Garrett was rushed
very badly, and the runners could

punts and then Washington, with
