# WUS—You Can't Just Pass It Off
## 
### 
Starting today and continuing through the
week, every member of this student body is
going to find himself under a little pressure.
It will be pressure of a financial kind, as solici
tors pass among you in your rooms, your din
ing halls, and even on Quad asking you to
give to the World University Service.
We believe the average Stanford student
accepts democracy as the most desirable
form ot government—a form which must be
fostered throughout the wSrld if man is to
enjoy both peace and liberty. We think he
realizes that the basis of any true decocracy
is an educated electorate. And we think he
would agree that an educated electorate is
the product of schools and universities.
And we ask you—the Stanford student—to

consider these things before you pass off the
WUS drive as just another pocket-draining
"cause."
A combination Marshall Plan and Point
Four program conducted at a student level,
WUS is an international organization which
supplies aid to needy students in Asia, Eu
rope, and the Middle East. "Aid" means food,
clothing, housing, books, lab equipment, and
funds. It also means an immeasurable ele
ment called security—a quantity vital to the
growth and independence of any educational
endeavor.
We think the World University Service is
worth the consideration—and the contribution
—of every Stanford student.
