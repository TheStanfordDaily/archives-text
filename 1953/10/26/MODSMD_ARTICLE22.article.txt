# Wilson and Dulles and Confusion
## 
### 
Another example of confusion on the part
of the higher echelons of the Eisenhower ad
ministration came glaringly to light last week
when two key men of the cabinet, Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles and Secretary of De
fense Charles E. Wilson, spoke in complete
contradiction on the point of our plans of main
taining American troops in Europe.
"Wilson Sees Troop Cut" read front-page
headlines in papers across the nation Tuesday.
But on Wednesday morning the nation was
greeted with headlines stating "No Cut in
Troops, Says Dulles."
Such obvious discordance in the top levels
of the administration is an extremely danger
ous and unsettling situation, one that the Presi
dent should take immediate steps to remedy.
Wilson, speaking before a news conference
Monday, said he thought a "substantial reduc
tion" in the number of troops in Europe would
be possible because of the development of new
air and atomic weapons.
Dulles, in his press conference Tuesday,
however, struck another note. He said he was
certain there was no plan for withdrawing any
of the six U.S. divisions now in Europe under
the NATO.
Surely such conflicting statements—which
die flashed hurriedly around the world by the
various press associations—must be cause of
some confusion among our European allies and

must add emphasis to the view reportedly
prevalent among many foreign officials that
the guality of American diplomatic leadership
has diminished sharply during the past year.
A report on European attitudes toward the
present Washington diplomatic staff was given
The Daily this summer by one of the nation's
most astute journalists, Erwin D. Canham, edi-*
tor of the Christian Science Monitor. In an in
terview, he said he found, while on a lengthy
European tour earlier this year, that "since
March the administration has pretty much dis
mantled our body of technicians in the field of
foreign affairs."
"There is definite need," he stressed, "to re
habilitate U.S. leadership overseas."
The apparent authority with which the two
top administrators announced their views
toward the possibility of a troops cut speaks
poorly of the guality of co-ordination and co-!
operation between the various departments of
government.
It would seem obvious that Mr. Eisenhower
has much work ahead of him in strengthening
his chain of command and drilling his "team"
into more perfect marching ste^.
We have been waiting since January for the
institution of that magic new policy of "clean
and careful administration" promised by the
Republican office seekers during last year's
heated campaign. We hope that we don't have
much longer to wait.

his chain of command and drilling his "team"
into more perfect marching ste^.
We have been waiting since January for the
institution of that magic new policy of "clean
and careful administration" promised by the
Republican office seekers during last year's
heated campaign. We hope that we don't have
much longer to wait.
Another example of confusion on the part
of the higher echelons of the Eisenhower ad
ministration came glaringly to light last week
when two key men of the cabinet, Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles and Secretary of De
fense Charles E. Wilson, spoke in complete
contradiction on the point of our plans of main
taining American troops in Europe.
"Wilson Sees Troop Cut" read front-page
headlines in papers across the nation Tuesday.
But on Wednesday morning the nation was
greeted with headlines stating "No Cut in
Troops, Says Dulles."
Such obvious discordance in the top levels
of the administration is an extremely danger
ous and unsettling situation, one that the Presi
dent should take immediate steps to remedy.
Wilson, speaking before a news conference
Monday, said he thought a "substantial reduc
tion" in the number of troops in Europe would
be possible because of the development of new
air and atomic weapons.
Dulles, in his press conference Tuesday,
however, struck another note. He said he was
certain there was no plan for withdrawing any
of the six U.S. divisions now in Europe under
the NATO.
Surely such conflicting statements—which
die flashed hurriedly around the world by the
various press associations—must be cause of
some confusion among our European allies and

must add emphasis to the view reportedly
prevalent among many foreign officials that
the guality of American diplomatic leadership
has diminished sharply during the past year.
A report on European attitudes toward the
present Washington diplomatic staff was given
The Daily this summer by one of the nation's
most astute journalists, Erwin D. Canham, edi-*
tor of the Christian Science Monitor. In an in
terview, he said he found, while on a lengthy
European tour earlier this year, that "since
March the administration has pretty much dis
mantled our body of technicians in the field of
foreign affairs."
"There is definite need," he stressed, "to re
habilitate U.S. leadership overseas."
The apparent authority with which the two
top administrators announced their views
toward the possibility of a troops cut speaks
poorly of the guality of co-ordination and co-!
operation between the various departments of
government.
It would seem obvious that Mr. Eisenhower
has much work ahead of him in strengthening
his chain of command and drilling his "team"
into more perfect marching ste^.
