# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
MONDAY MORNING JOTTINGS

Through the years there have been more chops at
Excom than there are bees at the Cellar. Excom
â– deserved some of them. It didn't dqserve others.
Excom, like every institution this side of heaven,

is not perfect. And like most
representative forms of govern
ment, it is the butt of joking. And
so 1 went to the Excom NSA dis
cussion the other night, never
expecting to discover what I did.
J found an uplifting mature dis
cussion on both sides, and a de
cision smoothly arrived at. I
found a student body president
conducting the meeting with dis
patch and clarity, and members
. r v i' ii._ .-i

oi Excom carefully considering the opinions of in
terested outsiders. And for the first time, I became
convinced that that gang of 17 students who gather
every Wednesday in the stuffy Excom room
were doing a pretty damn good job and deserve our
cheers instead of our barbs.
Just thought you might like to know.
A ROUND DOZEN. Mike Hudson, former Daily
sports editor, now a grad student in journalism, is
a proud man. He is proud, because he set a record

that stands about as much chance of being equaled
as FDR's four terms as president, as the Yankees'
five straight World Series crowns, or Connie Warrn
erdam' pole vault mark.
What record did Mike just set? The other day he
ran out of gas on Palm Drive for the twelfth time.
QUOTE OF THE WKKK. Owen Powell, guard on
the '52 Rose Bowl team, ranked as one of the hap
piest rooters at last week's UCLA wing-dinger.
Powell, student policing the roof of the press box
with Jin? Castagnoli, ex-Stanford All-Coast line
backer, said, "Did you know that I smoked three
packs of cigarettes during that game (an average of
one cigarette a football minute)? During the last
quarter, Castagnoli and I hugged and pounded each
other so much that I was sorer and more bruised
than I ever was playing football."
CHEETA POST-SCRIPT. Cheeta, the monkey who
serves as copy girl on the Daily, won a singular
honor last week. Appearing on the "Parker Animal
Television Show" on KPIX, she was chosen "animal
of the week." She competed against a hawk, two
chinchillas, an unusual variety of lizard, and a white
rat.
PAN-HELLENIC MISCUE. A Daily femme re
porter, not familiar with the Greek letter organiza
tions on campus, referred to the Phi Psi house in a
story as the Phy Sci house.
