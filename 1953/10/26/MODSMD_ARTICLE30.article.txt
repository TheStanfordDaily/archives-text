# Chamber Concert Shows 'Polish and Craftsmanship'

The Music Department presented its first concert of chamber
music at Cubberley Auditorium yesterday afternoon at 4, and
those few students who attended, along with a large and enthusi
astic audience of townspeople, heard a balanced program set
forth with a polish and craftsmanship not often achieved in uni-

versity chamber presentations.
Mozart's oboe quartet, K.,370, was
the high point of the afternoon. Tur
ner Bledsoe played the demanding
oboe part with precision and warmth,
and the entire ensemble showed a
maturity of conception in tempo,
balance, and dynamics that made the
work, to me one of the composer's
most attractive, come alive as I have
rarely heard it.
Herbert Nanney conducted the
University Singers in three madri
gals and a "fa-la" by Italian com
posers of the late sixteenth and
early seventeenth centuries. The
Arcadeh composition, "S'infinita
belle/,a," came off most success
fully; the intimate texture of
counterpoint so vital to the madri
gal style was preserved by the
singers and the dynamics and bal
ance were convincing.
The other three works were not
as deftly done, either in composi
tion or performance. Fourteen voices
are far too many for Gesualdo's
highly chromatic "Tu m'uccidi, o
crudele," and the difficulties of in
tonation seemed to vary for almost
every individual singer. The Vecchi
piece, "So ben mi ch'a bon tempo,"
is a pleasant bit of frippery hardly
worth the time .spent on it.
In general, the 'sound' of the group
of singers was what one would ex
pect locally from a number of tal
ented people insufficiently rehearsed
due to time â€”occasionally one part
would overbalance the general en
semble. Marilyn Feller's soprano
voice stood out to me as a true mad
rigal singer's voice.
After hearing Bralim's clarinet
quintet, op. 115, I always feel as
though I had eaten too much fruit
cake. This is no reflection on the
performance, which was crafts
manly and at times immensely
fluent, and the audience, in the
mass, seemed to like the work.
Mentioning individual performers
would take more space than I have,
since practically everyone deserves
commendation: Kathryn Vaught
played the 'cello part of the Brahms
with the skill and understanding de
manded by the part, Muriel Bermel's
aproach to the clarinet part was mu
sicianly and her technique more than
adequate for the virtuoso passages,
and Raymond Vaught held the quin

tet together well and played with a
sure control of violin tone in all reg
isters.
The real credit of the day, how
ever, perhaps belongs to violinist
Chalmers Smith, who played in both
instrumental compositions. A violist,
like a blocking back, rarely gets the
attention he deserves, even if he is
good; Mr. Smith, playing on a new
instrument, was all that good and
more.
