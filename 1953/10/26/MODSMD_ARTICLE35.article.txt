## 
### VIC CASEBOLT 
The Stanford Braves, after being blanked in the first half, over
came a 14-point deficit after the rest period to defeat the Treasure
Island Pirates by a 24 to 14 count at Stanford Stadium Saturday
afternoon.
Paced by hard-running Dorsey Atkinson, who seemingly car
lied the ball for Stanford ;it leasts

every other play, and Jerry Gustaf
son, who pitched strikes for long
gainers to both Atkinson and end
Jim McCamant, the Braves scored
once in the third quarter and ex
ploded for three more TD's in the !
linal period.
Treasure Island was the first to
yet a real offensive drive started
when they invaded deep into Stan
ford territory just before the end
of the first period. The Braves final
ly halted them on the 12, when a
fourth-down screen pass fell a yard
short.
After sending Atkinson around
end for several plays, Gustafson
caled on the halfback workhorse to
attempt a field goal with three min
utes gone in the second period. At
kinson kicked from 25 yards out, j
but the attempt was partially |
and fell short.
Treasure Island immediately gave
Stanford another chance when Tony j
Mosich recovered a TI fumble on
the TI 35. But after one series of
downs, the Navy boys took over
and didn't stop marching downfield
until five plays later. Bond .pitched I
a long pass to Young, who ran down
the right side line to score. The â– 
play covered 35 yards. Blanton's
conversion was good.
Treasure Island got their second
store only one minute later, when |
tackle Lou Sewell roared through |
Stanford's line and blocked Atkin
son's fourth-down pur\t from deep
in Stanford territory. Sewell grab- j
bed the ball in the corner of the j
end zone to score. Blanton's kick \
was good.
Atkinson led his team in a drive |
that reached the one-foot line after ,
Stanford received the second - half ,
kickoff, but they relinquished the
ball on a goal - line fumble. TI
couldn't move against the tough
Brave wall, and taking their punt,

the Braves moved down to the TI
H). On fourth down, Gustafson
threw a short running pass to Mc-
Cammant, who took it on the five
and romped over. Atkinson's kick
was wide to the left.
The Braves' next scoring play
came on the opening play of the
fourth quarter. Faced with third
down-one on his own 45, Gustafson
took the pass from center, ran to
his right, and threw a short pass to
Atkinson, who scampered all the
way down the sideline to score. The
latter's kick was again wide to the
left, leaving TI ahead, 14-12.
Fine defensive play by Bob Birkie
and Wes Wedge kept TI backs from
gaining at the line in the fourth
quarter. Fumbles cost Stanford the
ball twice before Walt Eagle finally
recovered one of the Pirates' bob
bles to set up the third Stanford
score.
Six plays later Gustafson hit Mc-
Cammant, who went into the end
zone alone to put Stanford ahead.
The score remained 18-14. however,
as Atkinson's third conversion at
tempt was blocked.
Stanford set up their last score
when they recovered another TI
tumble on the TI lfl. A delayed play
at right guard was good enough to
get A 1 Cheney into the end zone.
Gustafson's attempted pass for con
version went into the dirt.
