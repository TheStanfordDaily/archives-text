### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
The Stanford soccer team ab
sorbed one of its worst beatings in
several years last Saturday morn
ing. They were beaten 7-1, and the
team which administered the lash
ing was none other than California.
The Golden Bears, led by Ail-
American insidft Dennis Trayson,
who scored two goals himself, broke
loose in the second half with a tre
mendous five-goal spree. Half-time
score was 2-1, Cal.
Oddly enough, it was the Indians
who scored the first goal of the
game when Fred Tuerk followed up
on his own shot. The Bears knotted
the score in the same first quarter
and did not assume the lead till the
last minute of the second period.
Halfbacks Sam Register and Peter
Mack were doing their utmost to
contain the surging Bears, but the
Stanford line simply could not make
good on several early scoring op
portunities.
