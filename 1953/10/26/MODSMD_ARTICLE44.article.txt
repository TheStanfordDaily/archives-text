If a German student seems a
bit more serious minded and
preoccupied than the average
student—particularly the Amer
ican—there may be good rea
son. Chances are he's wonder
ing how the game's coming
along in Europe,
(The Allies and the Russians are
warming up the hell-bombs for the
main event, and he's afraid the fa
therland may go up in a mush
rooming cloud.)
This view is gaining in popularity
(or unpopularity) among Europeans
wedged between the A-bomb-pack
ing East and West, says Hans Wolf
gang Hartenstein from Berlin.
But not all Germans are as pessi
mistic as this. Hans certainly is not.
He recognizes the world's condition,
but believes sincerely there will be
no war.
"Neither side wants war. The
trouble is each side thinks the
other does. But war has been

averted for eight years. I think it
will never come."
