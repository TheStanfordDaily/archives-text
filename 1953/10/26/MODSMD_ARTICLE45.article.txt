# ASSU Foreign Scholars See American Life
## 
### 
Stanford's nine ASSU foreign
scholars, brought to the United
States and Stanford by the Foreign
Scholarship Committee, have begun
their jobs as students of life in the
United States and as interpreters of
life in their own countries.
Last week the nine scholars got
their first detailed look at an Ameri
can city during a tour of San Fran
cisco. Although not certain how typ
ically American San Francisco is,
they will be able to write their
friends at home about cable cars,
Chinese restaurants where patrons
can starve trying to manage chop
sticks, and other San Francisco at
tractions.
Throughout "the year, the foreign
scholars • will be given other op
portunities to find out more about
their "host country. And in keep
ing with the theme of the exchange
program, they will he called on to
speak to campus groups about
their own countries.
The nine students owe their pres
ence at Stanford to a program be
gun in 1948 when the ASSU voted to
finance and administer a number of
scholarships for foreign students.
The cost is divided between the stu
dent body and the living groups
which house and board the students.
The University pays half the tuition
and cooperates in the program.
The unique aspcct of the pro
gram is that Stanford students
manage the whole affair. Directors
(this year's arc Grant Spaeth and
Mike Brand) and their committee
pick the foreign students and ar
range all details.
The committee then counsels them,
helps them to adjust to Stanford's
academic and social life, and aids
them in the development of insights
into the American mind and manner.
The nine scholars arc Peter Ap
penzeller, Germany; Ismini Babbi,
Greece; Gianfranco Berardi, Italy;
Hans Hartenstein, Germany; Erich
Hochleitner, Austria; Lise - Lotte
Langbein, Germany; Luisita Sando
val, Philippines; Kurt Seidel. Ger
many; and Niels Vinding, Denmark.
