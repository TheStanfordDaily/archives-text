# WINS POETRY PRIZE
## 
### 
The $50 Clarence Urmy Poetry
Prize was won by Will C. Jumper,
a Stanford graduate student, for his
poem "A Sonnet, of Sorts."

Hans, 25 years old. is the Free
University of Berlin's ASSU ex
change scholar at Stanford. A his
tory major, he is living at the Vil
lage this quarter. Hans is interested
in political science and hopes to
teach and someday enter politics in
Germany.
Raised in Nazi Germany, at the
age of 15 Hans was receiving anti
aircraft instruction. In 1945, age 16,
he served with the infantry on the
Russian front and spent four months
in a Red POW camp.
Unification of their country,
Hans believes, is the German peo
ples' principal concern, and the
politics of the two major parties
revolve around it.
The Christian Democrats, headed
by Adenauer, advocate a military,
economic, and political union of
Western Europe (a confederation
rather than a U.S. of Europe) as the
first step.
On the other hand, the Social
Democrats, led by Ollenhauer, claim
that Western Germany's integration
into a European Defense Commu
nity would make unification impos
sible forever. They therefore pro
pose German unity first, Hans ex
plains, even if that means neutral
ization.
"But," he adds, "I don't think it
is possible to have a 'neutral' Ger
many—not in times like these."
Ilans doesn't illscount tin; possi
bility that the East Zoncrs might
successfully oust the Communists
by revolution. "But they'll have
to do it themselves. If the West
helps them with arms, it will
mean war for certain."
Except in Berlin, where the U.S.
was the hero of the blockade, the
Yank is a heavy burden—"but one
that vvc would not like to do with
out in these troubled times," Hans
says. He noted that there is often

greater resentment of the American
soldier in France and England, where
people feel as though their home
land were being occupied.
Is the Nazi party on the rise
again? No, says Hans. "There is
no fertile ground politically or eco
nomically for Nazi propaganda."
"Basically, our political parties
are democratic," he says.
Germany has made a remarkable
recovery since the war, according to
Hans. "In fact, surprising. Even di
vided as we are, we are the most
stable nation on the continent and
for that reason (plus historical en
mities) it will be difficult to draw
France into any alliance with the
Federal Republic. Odd as it may
seem, Germany, which lost the war,
came out stronger than some nations
which won."
The symbol of German pros
perity is Chancellor Adenauer,
who is a strong leader in his own
litfht and no puppet of the U.S.,
Hans believes.
Although Hans hasn't had time to
form any permanent impressions of
the U.S., he believes school life here
social, student - professor relations
more intimate, and courses more
closely supervised than in Europe.
Baseball to Hans is an American
enigma. "During the World Series
I saw some man running around the
bases and another swinging at a
ball, but that's about all I can un
derstand. Maybe I'll catch on be
fore I leave."

successfully oust the Communists
by revolution. "But they'll have
to do it themselves. If the West

mean war for certain."
Except in Berlin, where the U.S.
was the hero of the blockade, the
Yank is a heavy burden—"but one
that vvc would not like to do with
out in these troubled times," Hans
says. He noted that there is often

greater resentment of the American
soldier in France and England, where
people feel as though their home
land were being occupied.
Is the Nazi party on the rise
again? No, says Hans. "There is
no fertile ground politically or eco
nomically for Nazi propaganda."
"Basically, our political parties
are democratic," he says.
Germany has made a remarkable
recovery since the war, according to
Hans. "In fact, surprising. Even di
vided as we are, we are the most
stable nation on the continent and
for that reason (plus historical en
mities) it will be difficult to draw
France into any alliance with the
Federal Republic. Odd as it may
seem, Germany, which lost the war,
came out stronger than some nations
which won."
The symbol of German pros
perity is Chancellor Adenauer,
who is a strong leader in his own
litfht and no puppet of the U.S.,
Hans believes.
Although Hans hasn't had time to
form any permanent impressions of
the U.S., he believes school life here
social, student - professor relations
more intimate, and courses more
closely supervised than in Europe.
Baseball to Hans is an American
enigma. "During the World Series
I saw some man running around the
bases and another swinging at a
ball, but that's about all I can un
derstand. Maybe I'll catch on be
fore I leave."

Hans, 25 years old. is the Free

Germany.
Raised in Nazi Germany, at the

he served with the infantry on the

Unification of their country,
Hans believes, is the German peo
ples' principal concern, and the
politics of the two major parties
revolve around it.
The Christian Democrats, headed
by Adenauer, advocate a military,
economic, and political union of
Western Europe (a confederation
rather than a U.S. of Europe) as the
first step.
On the other hand, the Social
Democrats, led by Ollenhauer, claim
that Western Germany's integration
into a European Defense Commu
nity would make unification impos
sible forever. They therefore pro
pose German unity first, Hans ex
plains, even if that means neutral
ization.
"But," he adds, "I don't think it
is possible to have a 'neutral' Ger
many—not in times like these."
