# Living Group Contribution Chart Sparks WUS Donations; Auction Also Planned
## 
### 
A large illustrated chart hunt?
above the Cellar this morning will
dramatize competition between liv
ing groups for the highest per capita
contribution to the World Univer
sity Service Drive, chairman Bob
Gable announced last night.
Tonight a Dutch auction will be
held immediately following dinner
in the Roble main lobby with all
proceeds going to WUS. In Dutch
auctions, each bidder pays only the
difference between his bid and the
previous bid. This way no one pays
a huge sum, but everyone who par
ticipates vocally also participates
financially.
The chart above the Cellar shows
the contributions by living group,
with the figures symbolizing WUS
which are seen on posters marking

progress up the columns as contri
butions are received and recorded.
Displays were put up in the win
dows of the Bookstore yesterday,
the banner reminds everyone head
ing to or from Quad that the Drive
needs his support, and posters have
been put up all over campus. The
purpose of these displays and pub
licity are to create an awareness of
the needs of students in less fortu
nate countries and a corresponding
desire to do something about it—
financially, of course.
Solicitors may turn in daily con
tributions to Ed Ardzrooni, WUS
treasurer, from 4 to 5 p.m. in the
YWCA office on the third floor of
the Women's Clubhouse.
