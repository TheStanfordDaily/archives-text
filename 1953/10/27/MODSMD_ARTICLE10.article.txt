# Row House Thief Jobs ATO Chow
## 
### 
Hungry robbers were at work at
the ATO house Saturday night.
While the fraternity brothers
were at the Hog Wallow, more than
$200 worth of food and kitchen sup
plies were lifted by the thieves.
Stolen were the following items:
43 T-bone steaks, valued at $1.20
each; two roast turkeys; a roaster,
valued at $20; five cans of frozen
orange juice; five pounds of frozen
peas; one crate of eggs, worth $90.
The theft may have been a prank,
but no indications have yet been
given as to who the practical jokers
might be.
