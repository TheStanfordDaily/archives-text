### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Oct. 2(5
(UP)—The United States charged
today that many American prison
ers in Korea were tortured to death
in Russian-directed attempts to ob
tain false germ-war confessions.
Dr. Charles Mayo, a member of
the famous Minnesota medical fam
ily and a member of the American
delegation to the United Nations,"
made the charge before the U.N.
Mayo said the teams that worked
on American POW's in Korea were ,
"past masters at the business of Ret- !
ting the kind of confessions they
want." He told the (50-nation main
political committee that Andrei Y.
Vishinsky, chief Soviet delegate to
the U.N., "is an authority on this
subject." Vishinsky was not present
to hear Mayo describe his talents.
. Eight of the 10 confessed after be
ing subjected to methods Mayo
likened to the experiments per
formed on dogs and rats 1/ the
Soviet biologist Pavlov in producing
conditioned reflexes.
"This is the very technique which

the Communists appear to have
used on their intended 'germ war
fare' victims," Mayo said. "Resist
ance was punished . . . signs of co
operation, on the other hand, were
rewarded."
"No wonder that sonic of our
prisoners, miserably weakened
with weeks and months of mis
treatment, were brought down to
that animal level of response
where survival on any terms
seemed more important than the
moral principles that distinguish
men from beasts.
"If anything is surprising to me,
it is that so many of our soldiers—
both those who confessed and those
who did not — somehow continued
throughout to act like men," Mayo
said.
Soviet Delegate Jacob A. Malik
replied immediately to the United
States charges in a 45 - minute
speech charging the Americans re
pudiated their germ-war "confes
sions'' to save themselves from pun
ishment for trPMson or other crimes.
