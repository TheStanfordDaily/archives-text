# Excom and Academic Freedom
## 
### 
We hope that the Executive Committee,
when it meets tomorrow evening, will find its
agenda sufficiently clear to permit renewal
of consideration of academic freedom, a sin
gularly vital issue that was first officially acted
upon by last year's Excom and furthered dur
ing the summer by a special ASSU-sponsored
discussion group.
During spring and summer quarters particu
larly, students of this University made remark
able strides toward stimulating campus-wide
consideration of academic freedom, its inher
ent rights and its responsibilities.
But, because of the priority of other issues—
the question of membership in the National
Students Association being the foremost—dis
cussion of the issue has been delayed so far
this term.
However, with the NSA guestion finally
settled and a legislative lull apparently in
the offing, we urge Excom to take up the
guestion of academic freedom as soon as
possible—even at tomorrow's meeting.
We urge that action be undertaken at this
point to insure that whatever group or commit
tee that might be established to consider aca
demic freedom will have ample time to cover
the many aspects of the issue before the end
of the school year, at which time we would
like to see the endorsement -of some statement
on the freedom that would be representative
of the Stanford student body.
It is our belief that students should take a
hand in crystallizing public opinion on aca
demic freedom. We feel that at the moment
there are few questions of more import to
students than that of academic freedom; for
that freedom, at present apparently only
vaguely appreciated by the general public,
guarantees the right of free inquiry and unin

hibited research, both essential prerequisites
to true scholarship.
Campus interest in the crucial subject was
initially aroused last spring when a group of
students, acting independently of any for
mal ASSU body, drew up a statement on
academic freedom that was sharply critical
of various legislative committees then prob
ing supposed subversion in colleges.
Prompted by this group, Excom followed up
with the appointment of a special study com
mittee to sample and weigh campus opinion
on the issue.
The work begun by this committee was con
tinued with diligence by the summer Excom,
which was headed by Fran Kirk, who is now
studying at Princeton.
At the outset of its term, the summer legis
lative group organized open discussions which
were held weekly and which attracted about
50 students from all departments, including a
number of graduate students. The atmosphere
of these discussion sessions, on the whole, was
spirited, impartial, and very high toned.
To conclude summer activities on the issue,
the ASSU sponsored a debate on whether leg
islative committees had the right to investigate
subversion in colleges.
However, neither during spring nor summer
quarter did the committees have sufficient time
to draw up a statement on academic freedom
that could speak for the Stanford student body.
That is a job that remains to be done, and
one that we think is properly fitting for this
year's Excom which already has proved itself
an able group.
A statement, openly and considerately ar
rived at, would, it would seem, help clear our
thinking on academic freedom, and perhaps
aid others in discussing and debating the
issue.

However, with the NSA guestion finally
settled and a legislative lull apparently in
the offing, we urge Excom to take up the
guestion of academic freedom as soon as
possible—even at tomorrow's meeting.
We urge that action be undertaken at this
point to insure that whatever group or commit
tee that might be established to consider aca
demic freedom will have ample time to cover
the many aspects of the issue before the end
of the school year, at which time we would
like to see the endorsement -of some statement
on the freedom that would be representative
of the Stanford student body.
It is our belief that students should take a
hand in crystallizing public opinion on aca
demic freedom. We feel that at the moment
there are few questions of more import to
students than that of academic freedom; for
that freedom, at present apparently only
vaguely appreciated by the general public,
guarantees the right of free inquiry and unin

hibited research, both essential prerequisites
to true scholarship.
Campus interest in the crucial subject was
initially aroused last spring when a group of
students, acting independently of any for
mal ASSU body, drew up a statement on
academic freedom that was sharply critical
of various legislative committees then prob
ing supposed subversion in colleges.
Prompted by this group, Excom followed up
with the appointment of a special study com
mittee to sample and weigh campus opinion
on the issue.
The work begun by this committee was con
tinued with diligence by the summer Excom,
which was headed by Fran Kirk, who is now
studying at Princeton.
At the outset of its term, the summer legis
lative group organized open discussions which
were held weekly and which attracted about
50 students from all departments, including a
number of graduate students. The atmosphere
of these discussion sessions, on the whole, was
spirited, impartial, and very high toned.
To conclude summer activities on the issue,
the ASSU sponsored a debate on whether leg
islative committees had the right to investigate
subversion in colleges.
However, neither during spring nor summer
quarter did the committees have sufficient time
to draw up a statement on academic freedom
that could speak for the Stanford student body.
That is a job that remains to be done, and
one that we think is properly fitting for this
year's Excom which already has proved itself
an able group.
A statement, openly and considerately ar
rived at, would, it would seem, help clear our
thinking on academic freedom, and perhaps
aid others in discussing and debating the
issue.
We hope that the Executive Committee,
when it meets tomorrow evening, will find its
agenda sufficiently clear to permit renewal
of consideration of academic freedom, a sin
gularly vital issue that was first officially acted
upon by last year's Excom and furthered dur
ing the summer by a special ASSU-sponsored
discussion group.
During spring and summer quarters particu
larly, students of this University made remark
able strides toward stimulating campus-wide
consideration of academic freedom, its inher
ent rights and its responsibilities.
But, because of the priority of other issues—
the question of membership in the National
Students Association being the foremost—dis
cussion of the issue has been delayed so far
this term.
