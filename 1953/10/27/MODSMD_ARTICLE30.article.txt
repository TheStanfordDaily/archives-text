### DICK MANSFIELD 
Yesterday the Daily printed a compilation of last
year's grade - point averages, arranged by living
groups. Of course, a compilation by living groups
tends to hide the fact that individual effort—three
long quarters of individual effort—went into the com-

posite result. For instance, rumor
has it that one club finished high
among men's groups mainly be
cause a certain member strove
mightily and went plus for the
first time in his career. So as
each student studies the statistics
he will naturally call to mind his
personal contribution.
And here are some handy facts
ori grade-point averages: How to
build up low ones, live down high

ones, and find out whether they're high or low, with
out a slide rule.
Step One: COMPUTING THE
GRADE-POINT AVERAGE
To compute one's grade-point average, one must
lake into consideration certain factors. First, if you
live in a fraternity house, take ten points ofl'. That's
what they do when they figure the University aver
ages; you can do it too.
Subtract hours you expect to spend at football
games, dances, parties, sleeping, eating, resting, think
ing from the total number of hours in the day (ac
cording to the Poly Sci department, a student's day
is composed of 25 hours). Then divide this figure by
the number of pages in your Industrial Psych book

times the number of roommates you have. Not only
does this give you your grade-point, it gives it to
you in advance. From it, you can compute your
grades. You, too, can say, "I've got a four point!" or
"I've got a point four," as the case may be.
Step Two: ADJUSTING ONESELF TO
THE GRADE-POINT AVERAGE
Naturally, a low grade-point average indicates to
the struggling scholar that he must lay off activities
and hit the books. A middling average is best—leads
to peace of mind.
Above all, keep your wits about you. Say, for ex
ample, you pulled a big 2.11 grade-point average for
a given period of time. For different situations, your
attitude toward this achievement should be different:
For Mother: "Nearly a B average!"
For the Brothers: "Went plus!"
For Yourself: "Lucky! Lucky!"
There isn't much you can do about a 4.00 average.
Your bloodshot eyes and stack of books will convey
the necessary impression. Keep calm and do nothing
rash, and perhaps ere long your grade-point average
will go down and you will be able to face your
friends.
Step Three: DISREGARDING THE
GRADE POINT AVERAGE
It is said (and sagely, too) that one who doesn't
want his grade-point average will find soon that
Uncle wants him. But chin up! It is also said that
the lower the grade-point average, the farther you
get in the Infantry. See you there!

ori grade-point averages: How to
build up low ones, live down high

ones, and find out whether they're high or low, with
out a slide rule.
Step One: COMPUTING THE
GRADE-POINT AVERAGE
To compute one's grade-point average, one must
lake into consideration certain factors. First, if you
live in a fraternity house, take ten points ofl'. That's
what they do when they figure the University aver
ages; you can do it too.
Subtract hours you expect to spend at football
games, dances, parties, sleeping, eating, resting, think
ing from the total number of hours in the day (ac
cording to the Poly Sci department, a student's day
is composed of 25 hours). Then divide this figure by
the number of pages in your Industrial Psych book

times the number of roommates you have. Not only
does this give you your grade-point, it gives it to
you in advance. From it, you can compute your
grades. You, too, can say, "I've got a four point!" or
"I've got a point four," as the case may be.
Step Two: ADJUSTING ONESELF TO
THE GRADE-POINT AVERAGE
Naturally, a low grade-point average indicates to
the struggling scholar that he must lay off activities
and hit the books. A middling average is best—leads
to peace of mind.
Above all, keep your wits about you. Say, for ex
ample, you pulled a big 2.11 grade-point average for
a given period of time. For different situations, your
attitude toward this achievement should be different:
For Mother: "Nearly a B average!"
For the Brothers: "Went plus!"
For Yourself: "Lucky! Lucky!"
There isn't much you can do about a 4.00 average.
Your bloodshot eyes and stack of books will convey
the necessary impression. Keep calm and do nothing
rash, and perhaps ere long your grade-point average
will go down and you will be able to face your
friends.
Step Three: DISREGARDING THE
GRADE POINT AVERAGE
It is said (and sagely, too) that one who doesn't
want his grade-point average will find soon that
Uncle wants him. But chin up! It is also said that
the lower the grade-point average, the farther you
get in the Infantry. See you there!

Yesterday the Daily printed a compilation of last
year's grade - point averages, arranged by living
groups. Of course, a compilation by living groups
tends to hide the fact that individual effort—three
long quarters of individual effort—went into the com-

posite result. For instance, rumor
has it that one club finished high
among men's groups mainly be
cause a certain member strove
mightily and went plus for the
first time in his career. So as
each student studies the statistics
he will naturally call to mind his
personal contribution.
And here are some handy facts
