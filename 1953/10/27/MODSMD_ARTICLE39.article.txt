## The 						Inside Pitch 
### 
Now that Casey Stengel and his Yankees are safely in the counting
house gloating over their record-breaking World Series receipts, Stanford
baseball coach Everett Dean has assembled his aspirants on the Sunken
Diamond for a two-practice-a-week workout in order to mold a team for
the '54 campaign.
One of the first things that Mr. Dean told his players was that they

would have to fill two roles, that of
a ballplayer and that of a grounds
keeper. He reported that the attend
ance receipts from Stanford's grid
games were way below what the
athletic department had anticipated.
This shortage in money would mean
that the school probably couldn't
afford to have the ground crew
groom the baseball diamond in ad
dition to their other chores this
quarter.
This problem of low attendance at
football games isn't just Stanford's
worry as colleges across the nation
are observing that the turnstiles are
becoming woefully ignored. Of
course, the big rivalries: Army-
Navy, USC-UCLA, Cal-Stanford,
Duke-North Carolina, Pennsylvania-
Cornell, etc., will always fill the
parks, but the lesser contests aren't.
Thus we have a dilemna.
> In Stanford's case the first two
games weren't what you'd call the

top attractions of the season. A handful of College of the Pacific rooters
came up for the opener, but many of the fans around the arfea didn't fig
ure the game to he much of a contest. How wrong can you get? Another
factor was, of course, that school wasn't in session, which kept practically
the entire student body from the opener, while the freshmen and early
returning upperclassmen did fill up the rooting section for the Oregon
game. No attendance records were broken, however.
The Illinois contest figured to be one of the better inter-sectional meet
ings of the year, and yet the Illini's 70,000 plus Memorial Stadium was only
half full.
As far as the nationwide picture is concerned some observers believe
that many fans prefer to watch the game in 2-D rather than with glasses
(field, that is). They would rather enjoy the luxury of their living room
and big-screen TV, while avoiding traffic jams and (in many parts of the
country) raw fall weather.
While there is some validity to this statement, it does have its drawbacks
in that the TV viewer can only view General Motors' "Game of the Week,"
whereas three years ago he could pick up four or five top contests.
Other critics are saying the change to one-platoon football has caused
many fans to forego the game because of the sloppy play that has re
sulted. And yet, there are iust as many, if not more fans, that have re
turned to (he game in order to see the real Ail-Americans, the boys
who give and take both ways, in action again.
There is a problem, but is there a solution? From the results of one ex
periment, officials of Villanova College say there is. Villanova has been
trying to climb into the football spotlight for the past several seasons. In
order to do this Villanova has realized that it needs not only a team, but
a good following also.
There's nothing that peps up a team more and gives it that little some
thing extra, which makes it do the impossible, than for every seat in the
park to be occupied. For example, ta"ke the Boston Braves of 1952. They
finished in the second division. In 1953 they were the Milwaukee Braves.
They finished second. It was the same team under the same management.
The difference was that it had backing. So much of it that the total Na
tional League attendance record for one season was shattered.
Villanova's fondest expectations were for a crowd of 35,000 for the sea
son's opener against Georgia. The pre-season ticket sale went fairly well,
but the ticket department wasn't satisfied. Heads were put together,
schemes were analyzed and then the masterminds came out with the idea
of selling 40,000 tickets at a reduced price to supermarkets in and around
Philadelphia.
For every $10 order of food, two tickets were given away to the cus
tomers. The tickets went like hot cakes on a wintry morning, and 20,000
more were distributed.
The result was that 97,000 fans jammed every nook and cranny of Phila
delphia's Municipal Stadium, an unprecedented number for an Eastern
opener. In fact, with the exception of the 100,000 total that turns out for
every Army-Navy clash, there hadn't been a crowd to compare with that
figure since the curtailment of the Army-Notre Dame series several years
ago.
Nov/, the question is: Why doesn't Stanford try the Eastern experiment?
There's no doubt but what the "Big Game" will have them hanging from
the rafters, but what about this week's contest with Washington State,
which isn't going anywhere, and San Jose State which can't go there any
way?
Surely you can't fill the stadium with the high school throng, nor is it
profitable. Stanford can't lose much by experimenting, and it might foster
relations between Stanford and Palo Alto, not to mention the effect on
other Peninsula communities. Clark Shaugnessy experimented with the
T-formation in 1940 and Stanford went to the Rose Bowl to defeat Nebraska
21-13. If we experiment again we might not go to the Rose Bowl, but at
least Everett Dean's gang won't have to sweep pebbles from the infield.
