# Indians Prep For WSC Tilt
## 
### 
Chuck Taylor gave his first team
a rest from contact work yesterday
and sent his second and third
squads through a rough scrimmage.
A 1 Napoleon, quick left half, ac
counted for 25-yard and 55-yard
bursts and halfs Bill Tarr and Bill
Rogers also were impressive. Line
Coach Dutch Fehring singled out
tackle Chris Marshall and guard Joe
Long for their aggressive line play.
The Indians fortunately only suf
fered one injury in the Washington
game. That was a recurring injury
to fullback Bill Wentworth, who in
curred a nerve pinch in his shoul
der. He'll be kept out until the USC
>>ame and maybe longer. Barry
Smith, the six - four tackle, ran
around in sweat clothes, but won't
suit up for Washington State this
Saturday.
He "should be ready for USC the
week after.
After the workout the team heard
Bob Ghilotti's scout report on WSC
and then reviewed the*game movies.
Taylor made it clear that he
wasn't at all satisfied with the tack
ling and blocking in the Husky tiff.
