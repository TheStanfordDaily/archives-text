GOAL LINE BOUND—Ron Cook slices through the Washington secondary on his first-quarter
punt run-back that went all the way. The touchdown jaunt covered 52 yards and gave Stanford
an early lead in the contest at Seattle last Saturday. An unidentified Card takes out the Huskies'
Earl Monlux and Milt Bohart 5 (66) while Northerners Ed Sage (46) and Jim Warsinske fall in Cook's
wake. Stanford won, 13-7. —Courtesy Palo Alto Times
