SAN"FRANCISCO~Oct. 26 (UP)—
Coach Chuck Taylor of the Stanford
Indians, riding a beautiful crest of
winning ways and with a loop-lead
ing 4-0 record in the Pacific Coast
Conference, practically guarantees
that his club will never make it to
the Rose Bowl.
"All I can say is that it is better
to be lucky than good," Taylor told
newsmen attending the weekly
Northern California Football Writ
ers' Association meeting.
"We played our worst game of
the season against Washington
and still were lucky enough to
win," said Taylor. "We'll have to
improve 300 to 400 per cent to
beat Washington State on Satur
day. The Cougars have the best
back in the conference in Wayne
Berry. I'm told."

Taylor said that he was going to
work on the Indian ground game,
which has been noticeable by its ab
sence so far this season. Most of the
Stanford drives have been accom
plished via the airlanes.
"We have a weak defense, too," he
admitted, "and it is possible that
Washington State will score on us
all day."
He said he thought the Cougars
should be "rated over Stanford" off
the games the two clubs played last
week. (Washington State was
thumped by UCLA, 44-7.)
