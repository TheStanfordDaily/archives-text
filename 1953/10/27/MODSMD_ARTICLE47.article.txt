SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 26 (UP)
—The Golden Bears of University of
California, whipped by Southern
California, 32-21), have a "good
chance" of beating UCLA in Los
Angeles Saturday, Coach Lynn
(Pappy) Waldorf said today.
Looking ahead to the crucial game
that will eliminate either the Bruins
or the Bears from further considera
tion for the Rose Bowl, Waldorf
said:
"We have a good chance to beat
UCLA if we can hold onto the ball
and stop that fumbling. We must
score at least three touchdowns,
though; and at the same time we
will have to hold them to one or two
touchdowns."
Waldorf had no excuses or alibis
for the fumbling his boys did
against USC Saturday.
"In all the years I've been in foot
ball," said Waldorf, "I never have
been able to explain fumbles. We
must have set some kind of a record
in the first half, though, when we
lost the ball on fumbles four times
to USC on the four-, five-, six-, and
seven-yard lines."
Waldorf said that earlier in the

season his scouts had warned that
USC would be tougher than UCLA.
However, he said that the most re
cent reports indicated that the Bru
ins were the better ball club.
The portly coach indicated that he
might have thought USC got a ma- j
jority of the breaks.
"I'll have to admit that they had
pretty good control of their quick
kicks," he grinned. The Trojans
quick-kicked 57 yards dead on the
,Cal four once; and G7 yards dead on
the Cal one-foot line another time.
