# Shelter to Be Built For Student Rides
## 
### 
A pedestrian shelter will be built
on Palm Drive for students waiting
for rides to Stanford Village or Palo
Alto.
Alpha Phi Omega, service frater
nity, proposed the shelter and is
helping to defray the cost.
The structure will be slightly
nearer Palo Alto than the area tra
ditionally used by students, to avoid
converging traffic at the intersection.
The low-pitched tile roof will be
supported by heavy redwood posts.
Raised portions of the concrete foun
dation will form benches at the ends.
