# Union Group Will Debate Labor Policy
## 
### 
"Are the present administration's
policies anti - labor?" â€” that's the
topic up for discussion and debate
at the Political Union's first meeting
tomorrow night at 8 in Cubberley.
An address by Democratic Con
gressman John R. Shelley from San
Francisco will open the meeting,
Stanford's first on-campus venture
into partisan debate in recent years.
At the Union meeting Con
gressman Shelley's address on the
administration's labor policies will
be followed by a rebuttal from
Stanford Young Republican John
Begg, chairman of the College
Service Committee of the Young
Republican National Federation
and National Youth Adviser to
the Republican National Commit
tee.
After the two opening speeches
the meeting will be thrown open to
debate from the floor.
The two parties now in the Union,
the Republicans and the Democrats,
have each appointed three privi
leged speakers to open the evening's
debate. When these six and three
"independents" have spoken, Union
chairman Wayne Fuller will recog
nize speakers on both sides of the
issue until everyone who wishes to
speak has had a chance.
The meeting will conclude with a
hand-vote on the question.
