# Nine Booths to Highlight Women's Row Carnival
## 
### 
Plans are well under way for Fri
day night's Women's Row Carnival,
according to co-chairmen Mary Sa
rah DeWitt and Nancy Schmidt.
The annual Row scholarship ben
efit affair is scheduled to begin at
7:30 and last until 12, and will be
held entirely on Lower Row.
Each of the nine women's houses
has planned several concessions for
the entertainment of Carnival-go
ers. The individual contributions of
the houses are as follows:
Durand will have a "gizmo" and
white elephant booth, a beer bottle
hitting booth with a bottle of beer
for a prize, and a "Loop the Ankle"
booth, which will provide feminine
ankles as targets for embroidery
hoops. The prizes to be awarded at
this booth are the garters worn by
the anonymous legs.
A Hawaiian booth selling Hawai
ian foods and furnishing entertain
ment in the form of guitar playing
and Hawaiian songs will be pro
vided by Jordan House. A similar
booth was part of last year's Row
Carnival and was found to be very
popular. A balloon shaving booth
and a penny pitching booth will
complete Jordan's contribution.
Guthrie's booths will feature
blowing out candles with water
guns, hammering nails, and lishim;

for goldfish with an embroidery
hoop which has been covered with
Kleenex.
A darts and balloons booth, a
strength testing machine, and a
booth featuring girls as targets of
wet. sponges will be set up by Roth
House.

The girls of Russell House plan I
to sell coffee, cider, doughnuts, and |
cookies in a booth on their lawn.
Stillman also will sell food and in j
addition will be showing movies.
Storey House hopes to be able to
sell cotton candy to the crowd, and
is also planning to have pogo stick

races in the driveway, a fortune
telling booth, horse racing, and ping
pong games which will be set up on
a challenge basis with the girls of
the house challenging anyone who
wants to play.
A Moulin Rouge theme will pace
the talent show to be put on by La
throp House. Card tables will be
spread around at the house among
which singers, carnation venders,
and hot cider and peanut venders
will wander.
The gambling casino, which has
always been a popular feature at
Row Carnivals, will again bo offered
by Hurlburt House. Several differ
ent games of chance will be pro
vided to entice the gamblers in the
crowd.
All booths will be set up tfn the
lawns of Lower Row houses.
There will be a rally featuring
Bob Smith's Dixieland Band on the
Beta house lawn shortly before 8
p.m., when an auction will be held.
Objects to be auctioned will be pro
vided by Palo Alto merchants and
will go to the hgihest bidders.
Last year's Row Carnival netted
enough to give two scholarships of
two quarters' tuition each to de
serving Row residents. The co
chairmen ol this year's Carnival
hope to match or better that record.
