## Hughes Proposes Public Support of Cultural Centers 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Professor Glenn Hughes, internationally known drama author
ity, vigorously proposed public support for opera, theater, art
galleries, and other cultural centers, in the Tuesday Evening
Series lecture last night in Memorial Auditorium.
"America and the Arts" was the title of the talk.

Hughes, a Stanford graduate in'
1916 and now head of the University
of Washington School of Drama, de
cried the prevalent American atti
tude toward most forms of art.
He said that a majority of the
people consider "artists eccentrics
and art something to be indulged
in."
He called this attitude and the
resulting American emphasis on
physical rather than mental de
velopment a threat to the coun
try's well-being.
Hughes said, "There must be in
tellectual and spiritual creativeness
in the complete life."
Instead, he said, we think there
"is nothing too good for the kiddies,
but nobody cares what happens to
them after they grow up. We are
raising a generation of healthy little
morons who when they grow up will
be capable of nothing more than
golf."
Hughes then cited the number
of adults in mental hospitals—
equal to the number in all other
types of hospitals—as a possible
result of our lack of incentive for
mental creativeness.
He told of the apathy of the pub
lic; toward public education and
city-supported libraries before they
became accepted American institu
tions. He said a similar problem is
being faced today in efforts to get
tax-subsidized cultural centers.
"Today the problem is selling the
people on supporting the arts,"
Hughes said. "The cultural needs
of the people are not restricted to
books."
But Hughes fears that it will
take 25 years to break down the

stigma the public has placed orj
art.
"It is our God-given privilege to
participate in creative art," said
'the speaker. "Appreciation is not
enough; man must not merely be a
receiver."
He said the colleges are "over- |
flowing with talent, but most of it I
wastes away in futility" because of |
the "climate of the country against j
creativeness."
Hughes said that today the aver- !
age man "makes money, makes
more money, burns himself out. ■
dies, and his widow moves to Pasa- j
dena."
Hughes read selections from "No- j
tions Counter," a collection of his j
prose-type poems to be published I
soon.
