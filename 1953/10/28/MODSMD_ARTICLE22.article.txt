# KOREAN SITUATION
## Conference Deadline Passes; Talks Stymied 
### United Press 
PANMUNJOM, Wednesday,
Oct. 28—The deadline for start
of a Korean political conference
passed today with the Allies and
Communists so hopelessly dead
locked over details the session
may be delayed indefinitely.
The armistice agreement called for
start of a political conference 90 days
after signing of the truce —today
but negotiators in a pre-conferenc <•
meeting here have not even decided
on the time and place of the meeting.
U.S. Ambassador Arthur H. Dean
warned the Communists the peace
conference may not be held at all
unless they abandon thcif- stubborn
fight to invite neutral nations to the
talks, a position he described as
"utterly unreasonable and unac
ceptable."
Dean was on the alert for an.\
softening in the Communist at
titude at today's meeting when the
Communists said they would make
"detailed commentaries" on his
statements. But he feared another
propaganda blast instead.
In the first two days of pre-con
ference talks the Reds argued that
Asian neutrals must sit with the bel
ligerents to solve such problems a:;
the unification of Korea. For two
days Dean told them he will listen
to their arguments if they first settle
the time and place of the conference.
The Communists radio has denied
statements by Dean that Lt. Gen.
Nam 11, the chief Communist dele
gate at the armistice negotiations,
originally favored limiting the con
ference to nations that fought in
Korea, and that insistence now
ly repudiates" the armistice agree
ment.
Also deadlocked in Patimunjom
today, was the Neutral Nations
Repatriation Commission. It re
turned to the conference table, hui
a Swedish spokesman said the
"outlook is glum" for resuming cx
pl;,j(> re l U ctant prisoners.
The Commission, which has ad
i mitted failure in carrying out the
i most controversial aspect oi the
armistice agreement, had put a sub
j committee to work on an official ex
planation of the stalemate. It was
i due to report soon.
The situation was clouded further
j by official Communist charges that
I Allied agents are torturing and mur
dering war prisoners who say they
! want to go home, a charge described
i by Indian officials as "highly exag
| gerated."
The Communist charge was
countered by an escaped South
1 Korean, Sgt. Hwang Sc Woo, who
told the U.N. command the Com
munists were holding at least <>00
ROK prisoners who want to rc
| turn home.
He said the GOO were detained
| forcibly after they staged a demon
stration demanding they be repatri
ated. He said 20 were put in special
: confinement and the others were
i threatened with torture if they tried
| to return to South Korea.
The sergeant said the Communists
| told the demonstrators they were
now "citizens of the People's Demo
cratic Republic of Korea" and that
1 they "might as well forget about
j going home."
