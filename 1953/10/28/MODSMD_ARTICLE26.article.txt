(Editor's note: Larry Cahn, '53, who was volun
tarily drafted into the Army earlier (his month and
who is stationed at Fort Ord near Monterey, Cali
fornia, was sports editor of The Daily, Volume 122,
last fall. He will write periodically of his experience
in the Army for The Daily.)
FORT OHD, Oct. 26 —Processing is to the Army
what registration is to Stanford, only the Army lines
are longer and the total Processing Period is four days,
not one. Then you move into your actual eight or
sixteen weeks of Basic Training.
Processing is the procedure which every new Army
man must go through. Included in Processing are

.such things as Identification
Cards, shots, ''dog tags," orienta
tion talks and movies, insurance
and allotment discussions, inter
views to determine your back
ground, intelligence tests, and
uniform issue.
The reflections looking back on
the first week of Army life are
many, but the most lasting are as
follows.
Those who are drafted seem

more serious, more mature, older, and have a better
outlook than those who enlist, most of whom seem to

be seeking an escape from something.
There is an optional loyalty oath which all are asked

to sign.
The newsboys who hawk San Francisco and Los
Angeles papers to the long mess lines at 5 a.m., and
then return with the evening papers at 4:30 mess.
The shots: two to begin with, which hurt afterward
as does a pitcher's arm after throwing nine innings.
Two medics line up on each side of you and you get
a needle in each shoulder simultaneously.
The Blood Donor Card, showing your blood type,
which will get you out of another needle prick, if you
have it.
The care given to k the fitting and alteration of your
|'A" uniform, or the one worn off the post, compared
to the almost potluck drawing of fatigue issue.
The close-cut GI haircut, which takes away all in
dividuality and proves to be the great equalizer.
The old Army adage, "Never Volunteer," still holds.
Two volunteered for a typist and artist detail, and
were later seen shoveling dirt from a truck.
And finally the feeling of homecoming with such
fellow former Stanfordites as Jim Vick, Phil Saeta,
Doug Heller, Hank Rosin, Bill Fredricks. Ted Strom
berg. Bob Wade, Herb Osborne, Kent Clark, Dave
Cramer, Dale Van Dalsem, Wayne Culbertson. Paul
Johnson. Tom Eagle, and Eric Brazel, all here.

FORT OHD, Oct. 26 —Processing is to the Army
what registration is to Stanford, only the Army lines
are longer and the total Processing Period is four days,
not one. Then you move into your actual eight or
sixteen weeks of Basic Training.
Processing is the procedure which every new Army
man must go through. Included in Processing are

.such things as Identification
Cards, shots, ''dog tags," orienta
tion talks and movies, insurance
and allotment discussions, inter
views to determine your back
ground, intelligence tests, and
uniform issue.
The reflections looking back on
the first week of Army life are
many, but the most lasting are as
follows.
Those who are drafted seem

more serious, more mature, older, and have a better
outlook than those who enlist, most of whom seem to

be seeking an escape from something.
There is an optional loyalty oath which all are asked

to sign.
The newsboys who hawk San Francisco and Los
Angeles papers to the long mess lines at 5 a.m., and
then return with the evening papers at 4:30 mess.
The shots: two to begin with, which hurt afterward
as does a pitcher's arm after throwing nine innings.
Two medics line up on each side of you and you get
a needle in each shoulder simultaneously.
The Blood Donor Card, showing your blood type,
which will get you out of another needle prick, if you
have it.
The care given to k the fitting and alteration of your
|'A" uniform, or the one worn off the post, compared
to the almost potluck drawing of fatigue issue.
The close-cut GI haircut, which takes away all in
dividuality and proves to be the great equalizer.
The old Army adage, "Never Volunteer," still holds.
Two volunteered for a typist and artist detail, and
were later seen shoveling dirt from a truck.
And finally the feeling of homecoming with such
fellow former Stanfordites as Jim Vick, Phil Saeta,
Doug Heller, Hank Rosin, Bill Fredricks. Ted Strom
berg. Bob Wade, Herb Osborne, Kent Clark, Dave
Cramer, Dale Van Dalsem, Wayne Culbertson. Paul
Johnson. Tom Eagle, and Eric Brazel, all here.
