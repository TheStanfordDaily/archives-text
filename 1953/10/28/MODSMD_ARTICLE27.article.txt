# BULL SESSION
## 
### DICK MANSFIELD 
Longshot Lewis learned, toward the end of his
third quarter of freshmanbiology, that in terms of
the laws 01 probability he had one chance in 649,739
of holding a royal flush, unless he was using his own
deck. Had Longshot Lewis known this when he
came to Stanford, he would probably have gone the

way he did anyway, for Lewis
loved the slim chance and the
sporting odds.
Lewis started off innocently
enough, playing a little blackjack
and draw with the boys in his
room in Encina. From this he
went to holding pools on how
often the Civ lecturer would
pause to chuckle appreciatively at
his own dry wit. Then it was
betting on how long it would take
4U., 1 I\/T I ' T"1 1

the Stanford Marching Band, on any given Saturday,
to get from the 10-yard line to midfield, with a fly
ing start. Longshot Levis never missed a bet.
Ilis skill with the pasteboards was often rewarded
momentarily, and Lewis set himself up with a tall
black hat, a long black car, and a pocketful! of thick
black cigars. Needless to say, he was the nearest
thing possible to the Man Who Broke the Bank at
Monte Carlo, and he had fan clubs in all the wom
en's Row houses. It looked like he was riding
highâ€”he could even pay his tuition without winc
ing.
The decline of Longshot Lewis adds up, naturally,
to the moral of this fable. One night in the small
hours, as Lewis was playing a little hearts with the
boys, his luck changed. Before he knew it, his pockets
were empty and he was down to his last cigar. En-

cina no longer rang with his merry peals of laughter,
and the inmates could even get some sleep.
"No matter," said Lewis at length. "What I need
is a change of scene. I'll take my remaining wealth
and get me to Bay Meadows and wager on the ponies.
A tout acquaintance claims that Clopalong Placidly
can't miss in tomorrow's fifth; all he has to do is to
find his way to the starting gateâ€”from there it's a
cinch!" And off he went, humming "How Much Is
That Doggie at the Two-Dollar Window?" and chuck
ling to himself.
Lewis was gone three. He returned in a sweat
shirt and levis, walking. His tall black hat, long
black car, and one remaining long black cigar were
gone. Lewis was washed up, they said. He might as
well bet on the track , bugler's horse. His luck was
gone! Kaput! ,
"I'll start from scratch," said Lewis, and the next
time the entertainers went out to the Con Home,
Longshot Lewis went along. He picked out a very
small child.
"Look here, sonny," he said winningly. "You'd
like to learn a nice new game, wouldn't you!"
"Goo," said the
"Fine," said Lewis, and, producing a deck of cards
with his own initials on every card, he taught the
child the intricacies of whist.
When the child grew old enough to comprehend,
they told him what had happened. He then swore off
gambling forever and put himself through college
with his winnings.
And Longshot Lewis? Garfinkle of the P-TA, who
wrote the tract, says merely that Lewis vanished :
into a five-year biology course and, as soon as he >
graduated, faded quietly away.
