# CAMPUS OPINION
## On Intramural Football 
### 
To the Editor:
What is the sense of intramural football as now
played? Touch football, when played hard, requires
certain protective equipment, for the blocks thrown
in touch are just as hard as those in tackle. The
number oi' injured players per week points out the
results.
The majority of players have no intention of injur
ing anyone—they just get carried away with the play.
However, the injuries incurred are often permanent.
Already, there have been several cass of mild con
cussion.
One fellow, in particular, because of an illegal
block thrown after a play was over, may have to drop
out of school for the quarter, postpone graduation and
marriage, and be declared ineligible for the Newport
program.
I ask, is a game that results in so many injuries worth
continuftig? Football is a fine game when played with
the proper equipment and spirit. As things stand now,
however, it is impossible to get the equipment.
But how about improving the spirit?
Further, it would seem that there is need for more
careful supervision of the games. Many of the referees
pay little or no attention to infractions of the rules.
Granted that it is more of a job than one man can
reasonably do. But, perhaps, with more officials on
the field some reduction in the number of injuries
could be made.
(Name withheld by request)
(Editor's note: Though no exact figures are avail
able, it is believed by officials of the Department of

Athletics and the Health Service that more injuries
have resulted from intramural football this year
than last.
(According to Elwyn Bugge, assistant professor
of physical education and director of the intramural
program, most of these injuries have resulted from
"over-zealous play" on the part of the various teams.
Dr. George Houek, head of the Health Service, ad
vised that, aside from the routine scratches and
bruises, intramural competition and games at the
various dormitories and houses account for more
injuries than any other source.
(The doctor pointed out that most intramural
players are prone to injury because of the lack of
conditioning and because they are not equipped with
the proper protective gear. About supervision at the
games, Bugge said it is better this year than it ever
lias been.)

of physical education and director of the intramural
program, most of these injuries have resulted from
"over-zealous play" on the part of the various teams.
Dr. George Houek, head of the Health Service, ad
vised that, aside from the routine scratches and
bruises, intramural competition and games at the
various dormitories and houses account for more
injuries than any other source.
(The doctor pointed out that most intramural
players are prone to injury because of the lack of
conditioning and because they are not equipped with
the proper protective gear. About supervision at the
games, Bugge said it is better this year than it ever
lias been.)
To the Editor:
What is the sense of intramural football as now
played? Touch football, when played hard, requires
certain protective equipment, for the blocks thrown
in touch are just as hard as those in tackle. The
number oi' injured players per week points out the
results.
The majority of players have no intention of injur
ing anyone—they just get carried away with the play.
However, the injuries incurred are often permanent.
Already, there have been several cass of mild con
cussion.
One fellow, in particular, because of an illegal
block thrown after a play was over, may have to drop
out of school for the quarter, postpone graduation and
marriage, and be declared ineligible for the Newport
program.
I ask, is a game that results in so many injuries worth
continuftig? Football is a fine game when played with
the proper equipment and spirit. As things stand now,
however, it is impossible to get the equipment.
But how about improving the spirit?
Further, it would seem that there is need for more
careful supervision of the games. Many of the referees
pay little or no attention to infractions of the rules.
Granted that it is more of a job than one man can
reasonably do. But, perhaps, with more officials on
the field some reduction in the number of injuries
could be made.

(Editor's note: Though no exact figures are avail
able, it is believed by officials of the Department of

Athletics and the Health Service that more injuries
have resulted from intramural football this year
than last.
