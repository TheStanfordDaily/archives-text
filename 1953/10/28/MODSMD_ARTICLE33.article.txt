# Chappie Launches 55th Volume Today
## 
### TONY HODGE 
Stanford's humor magazine,
Chaparral, known to its close
friends as the "Chappie," is be
ginning its 55th year of publica
tion today.
Founded in 1899, the "Chappie" is
rated as one of the top three humor
publications in American colleges.
It has a record of fidelity to its
readers, having produced 54 vol
umes without a miss. The only ex
ception was in 1951, when Univer
sity officials felt that the humor was
waxing a little too "liberal" for de
cency. Regardless, only one issue
was missed and the "Old Boy" and

his crew bounced back onto -the
path of good taste without the
slightest loss of zeal.
As one enters the portals of the
Chaparral offices, located in the
weather-worn buildings across the
street from the School of Journal
ism, he is confronted by four walls
plastered solid with old ''Chappie''
covers, lewd cartoons, and cleverly
moustached photographs of former
"Chappie Queens of the Month."
Behind desks piled high with
other college humor magazines
and wads of crumpled paper, con
taining much of the "Old Boy's"
superfluous humor, sit the staff
members, continuously chuckling.
The only serious aspect of the of
fice is the photograph of a serenely
waving American flag, which was
dutifully hung on the "old cover
wall" in the place of the outlawed
1951 June edition.
The humor of Chaparral is per
sonified in the "Old Boy," who per
petuates himself each year in the
new editor. This year's "Old Boy"
is A 1 Ambler, who must dedicate

himself to find the humorous side
of everything.
This task may seem almost im
possible until one picks .up a
"Chappie" and. thumbing through
its pages, finds articles mercilessly
lampooning every form of campus
life.
The issues include from 30 to 48
pages of photo and art features,
jokes, fake advertisements, and par
odies on American collide life.
The "Chappie" is famous for its
theme issues, which include mimics
of national magazines and the übiq
uitously popular comic books.
"Fawchun," "Ladies' Prone Jour
nal," "Lite," and "Maudlin Screen"
are a few of its more recent efforts
at mimicry. "Crash Comics" is the
annual parody on popular comic
characters.
Although the Chappie is a prod
uct of the 19th century, its legal
owner and publisher—the Ham
mer and Coffin Society—was not
born until April 17. 1906—a few
hours before the great San Fran
cisco earthquake. Avid "Chap
pie staff members believe that
this "act of God" was more the
initial act of the "Old Boy" as he
made his first earthly appearance
on the Farm.
Admitting grudgingly that there
were traces of sadism in this prank,
the staffers retort triumphantly,
"But wasn't it the best practical
joke anyone could pull off?"

ginning its 55th year of publica
tion today.
Founded in 1899, the "Chappie" is
rated as one of the top three humor
publications in American colleges.
It has a record of fidelity to its
readers, having produced 54 vol
umes without a miss. The only ex
ception was in 1951, when Univer
sity officials felt that the humor was
waxing a little too "liberal" for de
cency. Regardless, only one issue
was missed and the "Old Boy" and

his crew bounced back onto -the
path of good taste without the
slightest loss of zeal.
As one enters the portals of the
Chaparral offices, located in the
weather-worn buildings across the
street from the School of Journal
ism, he is confronted by four walls
plastered solid with old ''Chappie''
covers, lewd cartoons, and cleverly
moustached photographs of former
"Chappie Queens of the Month."
Behind desks piled high with
other college humor magazines
and wads of crumpled paper, con
taining much of the "Old Boy's"
superfluous humor, sit the staff
members, continuously chuckling.
The only serious aspect of the of
fice is the photograph of a serenely
waving American flag, which was
dutifully hung on the "old cover
wall" in the place of the outlawed
1951 June edition.
The humor of Chaparral is per
sonified in the "Old Boy," who per
petuates himself each year in the
new editor. This year's "Old Boy"
is A 1 Ambler, who must dedicate

himself to find the humorous side
of everything.
This task may seem almost im
possible until one picks .up a
"Chappie" and. thumbing through
its pages, finds articles mercilessly
lampooning every form of campus
life.
The issues include from 30 to 48
pages of photo and art features,
jokes, fake advertisements, and par
odies on American collide life.
The "Chappie" is famous for its
theme issues, which include mimics
of national magazines and the übiq
uitously popular comic books.
"Fawchun," "Ladies' Prone Jour
nal," "Lite," and "Maudlin Screen"
are a few of its more recent efforts
at mimicry. "Crash Comics" is the
annual parody on popular comic
characters.
Although the Chappie is a prod
uct of the 19th century, its legal
owner and publisher—the Ham
mer and Coffin Society—was not
born until April 17. 1906—a few
hours before the great San Fran
cisco earthquake. Avid "Chap
pie staff members believe that
this "act of God" was more the
initial act of the "Old Boy" as he
made his first earthly appearance
on the Farm.
Admitting grudgingly that there
were traces of sadism in this prank,
the staffers retort triumphantly,
"But wasn't it the best practical
joke anyone could pull off?"
