# Xmas Post Office Jobs Open to Vets
## 
### 
Veterans interested in working in
the San Francisco post office during
Christmas vacation may apply from
now until Nov. 0. Non-veterans can
apply Nov. 9.
Positions are also open in the
Long Beach, Modesto, Oakland, Sa
linas, and Portland (Oregon) post
offices. Employees for the Pasaclena
office must be available by Dec. 14,
and for Sacramento by Dec. 16.
Application forms can be found
at the Student Employment Office
and should be filled out soon, since
the Post Office Department has or
dered an approximate 50 per cent
curtailment in Christmas temporary
employees. This is due to the De
partment ruling that more overtime
will be allowed regular employees.
