# PUNTS AND PITCHES
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Sshhh. Close the doors. Make sure no one is around. Search the room
for a hidden microphone. Because I am going to .say it. Just in a whisper,
mind you, but still I'm going to say it. Here it is: Rose Bowl, spelled R-o-s-e
B-o-w-1.
There, I've said it.
As they say in Hollywood, the plot is thickening. And right now Stan
ford is playing Mickey Rooney . . . the punk kid who wasn't supposed to

grab the heroine, but who nevertheless looks like he
might do just that.
In regard to the Rose Bowl race there is one unde
niable fact. It is just that ... a fact ... no amount of
opinions can alter it: At the present moment, Stanford
has a statistical inside track to Pasadena.
Chuck Taylor's squad has won four, dropped none.
The other main contenders have blemishes on their
records. UCLA has lost one (a memorable loss); Cal
was outsnookered by USC. And Washington has tied
one, lost another, and figures to do some more losing
with Cal and UCLA coming up. USC, which has a tie

with Washington on its record, is ineligible to go to Pasadena, since they
were the PCC representative last year.
How llie Rose Bowl Race Slacks Up
All of which leaves the race between Cal, UCLA, and that amazing group
oi athletes who romp around in red-and-white football knickerbockers.
Assuming that the Cards get by Washington State this weekend (more about
that later), the scramble for the roses will be between two teams. UCLA
and Cal engage in a cousinly civil war in Los Angeles this Saturday, and
the loser will have to say, "Wait till next year."
In the event that UCLA takes Cal, Washington, and USC (their next
three games), Stanford could lose to either Cal or USC (not both) and still
go to the Rose Bowl. This is because Stanford has beaten UCLA, and if two
teams are tied in the league standings, the PCC committee automatically
selects the squad which has beaten the other.
If Cal drubs UCLA and Washington, the Big Game would decide the Rose
Bowl representative, no matter if Stanford loses to the Trojans or not.
Sound complicated? It is. but no matter how you look at it, Stanford's
chances of winding up in the Rose Bowl are not inconsiderable.
I he Cougars Are Looming Up
But one of the greatest obstacles to Rose Bowl aspirations can be over
looking a team that is considered a weak sister in favor of teams like SC
and Cal. We refer to Washington State, which looms up on the immediate
horizon.
Frosh Coach Bob Ghilotti (who scouted WSC). not known for shocking
statements, said, "I would say that Washington State has a better chance
of beating Stanford than either Cal or UCLA. Why? We may be over
confident. and the Cougars are really pointing for us. Their scout reports
show our weaknesses, and they sincerely know they can take us. They
have a great tailback in Wayne Berry and the hardest-running pair of full
backs on the Coast."
The Indians have never had an easy time with the Cougars, and this
should be no exception. Naturally, it is of prime consideration that the
Indians squelch the Cougars . . . otherwise, Rose Bowl, good-bye.
Oop, sorry, I said those two words again. But, doggone, they say Pasa
dena is such a nice place to spend New Year's Day.

of beating Stanford than either Cal or UCLA. Why? We may be over
confident. and the Cougars are really pointing for us. Their scout reports
show our weaknesses, and they sincerely know they can take us. They
have a great tailback in Wayne Berry and the hardest-running pair of full
backs on the Coast."
The Indians have never had an easy time with the Cougars, and this
should be no exception. Naturally, it is of prime consideration that the
Indians squelch the Cougars . . . otherwise, Rose Bowl, good-bye.
Oop, sorry, I said those two words again. But, doggone, they say Pasa
dena is such a nice place to spend New Year's Day.

Sshhh. Close the doors. Make sure no one is around. Search the room
for a hidden microphone. Because I am going to .say it. Just in a whisper,
mind you, but still I'm going to say it. Here it is: Rose Bowl, spelled R-o-s-e
B-o-w-1.
There, I've said it.
As they say in Hollywood, the plot is thickening. And right now Stan
ford is playing Mickey Rooney . . . the punk kid who wasn't supposed to

grab the heroine, but who nevertheless looks like he
might do just that.
In regard to the Rose Bowl race there is one unde
niable fact. It is just that ... a fact ... no amount of
opinions can alter it: At the present moment, Stanford
has a statistical inside track to Pasadena.
Chuck Taylor's squad has won four, dropped none.
The other main contenders have blemishes on their
records. UCLA has lost one (a memorable loss); Cal
was outsnookered by USC. And Washington has tied
one, lost another, and figures to do some more losing
with Cal and UCLA coming up. USC, which has a tie

with Washington on its record, is ineligible to go to Pasadena, since they
were the PCC representative last year.
How llie Rose Bowl Race Slacks Up
All of which leaves the race between Cal, UCLA, and that amazing group
oi athletes who romp around in red-and-white football knickerbockers.
Assuming that the Cards get by Washington State this weekend (more about
that later), the scramble for the roses will be between two teams. UCLA
and Cal engage in a cousinly civil war in Los Angeles this Saturday, and
the loser will have to say, "Wait till next year."
In the event that UCLA takes Cal, Washington, and USC (their next
three games), Stanford could lose to either Cal or USC (not both) and still
go to the Rose Bowl. This is because Stanford has beaten UCLA, and if two
teams are tied in the league standings, the PCC committee automatically
selects the squad which has beaten the other.
If Cal drubs UCLA and Washington, the Big Game would decide the Rose
Bowl representative, no matter if Stanford loses to the Trojans or not.
Sound complicated? It is. but no matter how you look at it, Stanford's
chances of winding up in the Rose Bowl are not inconsiderable.
I he Cougars Are Looming Up
But one of the greatest obstacles to Rose Bowl aspirations can be over
looking a team that is considered a weak sister in favor of teams like SC
and Cal. We refer to Washington State, which looms up on the immediate
horizon.
