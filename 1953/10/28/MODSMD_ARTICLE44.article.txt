# Business Slump Predicted By Economics Professor
## 
### 
Predicting that "Business is not
' likely to be as good for some time

to come as it has been recently," |
Professor Lone Tarshis, Stanford
professor of economies, addressed a I
meeting of San Francisco cost ac
countants last night in San Fran
cisco.
Professor Tarshis said that a
"downswing in business" apparently
has started. He said, "The long
anticipated readjustment, disinfla
tion, recession, or depression seems
finally to have made its appear
ance."
Business has taken several
downswings since 1!)W>, Professor
Tarshis pointed out. Usually, these
have amounted to nothing. "But
it would be dangerous to dismiss
Ihe present danger signals," he
said.
Causes which Professor Tarshis
cited for the apparent downswing in
business include the decrease in
buying power among consumers,
who arc well stocked with the
products of industry and who might
not buy even if they had maintained
their buying power. Meanwhile,
business has increased its capacity
at least 100 per cent, Tarshis said.
He noted that there is a bright
er side to the picture. "A grow
ing consumer market seems as
sured; business evidently plans
still further expansion; the gov
ernment has tremendous power to
offset deflation. But it will he a
fight."
The meeting was ol' the San Fran
cisco chapter of the Natioanl Asso
ciation of Cost Accountants.
