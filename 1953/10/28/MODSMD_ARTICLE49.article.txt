# 'Whistlers' From Space Get Scientific Attention
## 
### MERLE BECHTHOLD 
Out from the cold and dark depths of outer space come the
weird "screaming meemie" sounds of the "whistlers." These
sounds, more attuned to the science fiction story than an elec
tronics laboratory, are being studied by a group of Stanford elec
trical engineers.
They have been systematically eavesdropping on the so-called

"whistlers" with amplifiers hooked *
to tape recorders in the belief that j
these short swishing noises, some
thing like a whip lashing through |
the air, may be put to some useful {
purpose.
Some whistlers, the Stanford re
search indicates, methodically arc
back and forth between two distant
points on the earth, passing cn route
through the outer ionosphere.
Thus, they have definite possi
bilities as a tool for exploring the
outer ionosphereâ€”the sire a some
700 miles beyond the surface of
the earth about which man must
know much more before he sets
ofT on a rocket for a trip into
space.
Another possible use is in corn- '
inunications. The volume of the
whistle diminishes very gradually
1 as the sound makes its repeated
i round trips through outer space,
i This gives promise that long-range
| telegraphic conversations could be
: carried on over the same loops
without the need for excessively
! powerful transmitters.
However, as strange as it may
| seem, the phenomenon which may
| be used to improve telegraphy has
always been a minor nuisance as a
cause of static. The Stanford re
searchers have traced written re
ports of this interference as far back
as 1894.
During the first World War,
[ both the enemy and the Allies
listened in on each other's tele
graph systems by sticking rods in
the ground to intercept the earth
currents set up by the electrical
pulses of telegraphy. A scientist
reported on this activity in a Ger
man journal in 1919, and described
the whistlers which interfered
with reception.
The whistlers are believed to be
caused by bundles of electromag
netic energy released by lightning
flashes. At least, English studies

have shown a definite correlation
between electrical storms and oc
currence of whistlers.
The Stanford researchers have
found that what sounds like the
same whistler will be picked up on
their tape recorder over and over
again at regular intervals of approx
imately three seconds.
This has given weight to the
theory that a whistler, originating
within range of the Stanford re
ceiver, will arc upward into the
ionosphere, return to the earth
some (i,00() miles away, and he
reflected hack to the Stanford
| listening post. This journey is ap
j parcntl.v repeated many times
i along the same path.
The Stanford engineers plan to
explore this theory further by set
ting up co-ordinate listening periods
with foreign researchers. They hope
to be able to gather data at both
ends of the whistler's arc.
