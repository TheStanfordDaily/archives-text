# ASUC Promises Refund To the Axe Purloiners
## 
### 
The party (or parties) who "removed" the famed Stanford Axe
from a display showcase on the University of California's Berkeley
campus last June received some relatively good news yesterday.
It came from Ralph Vetterlein, president of the Associated Stu
dents of UC, who explained that the $5 bill apparently left by the

purloiners to cover the cost of a+
broken window in Stephens Union in I
! which the Axe was displayed—was
J "more than sufficient."
In fact, he said, the damage
j amounted to only $3.64.
"The party (or parties) that stole
| the Axe should see me for the $1.36
I reimbursement," Vetterlein announ- !
ced.
Meanwhile, the search for the his
j toric old blade, traditional symbol of j
j rivalry between Stanford and UC,
| continues.
j Captain Frank Woodward of the
UC campus police said he had a
"feeling" the Axe was around the
UC campus, but had no information
as to exactly where it might be.
Stanford's radio station KZSU re
ported earlier this week that it
learned from an "authoritative
source" at UC that the Axe had
been found in a UC fraternity
house.
UC student leaders and members ;
of the specially appointed Axe-coni- j
mittee, investigating the disappear- j
ancc of the Axe. vigorously denied
the reports and said they were still
working on other leads that may j
eventually turn up the Axe.
