### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 28 (UP) â€”
President Eisenhower said emphati
cally today that the United States
has no plans to cut back its combat
forces overseas and added that in
some cases such troops are being
reinforced.
Simultaneously, it was learned the
Army is preparing to challenge De
fense Secretary Charles E. Wilson's
order, issued last spring, to make a
100,000-man slash in manpower. It
will argue it cannot absorb the cut
by the June deadline and still meet
overseas commitments.
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles said later that "there is
no contemplated withdrawal" and
Wilson stressed at a news confer
ence yesterday that he was talk
ing about the "long run."
Mr. Eisenhower told his news
confcrcncc today he would he
foolish to assume that develop
ment of new weapons would not
affect the makeup of military
forces. Rut he said three times
that no plan exists for withdraw
ing U.S. combat forces anywhere
in the world.
Actually, lie said. overseas
manpower is on the increase be
cause the Air Force is occupying
new bases which increase person
nel needs.
The Army now faces the problem
of concentrating its cut on support
troop.s within the United States. Of
ficials fear this would impair the
Army's ability to support its troops
overseas.
