It looks like open season on col
lege trophies.
First Stanford's historic Axe was
! stolen from the University of Cali
! fornia.
Now, San Jose State College re
ports that the 700-pound bell given
annually to the winner of the COP
! San Jose State football game, is miss
ing.
The bell has been missing since
last week, but most SJS student
leaders thought it had been removed
; for houseeleaning.
John Aitken, SJS student body
president, said he received a letter
signed "The Tigers" telling him to
| come to Stockton to get the bell.
"We figure to get it back Nov. 7
when the Tigers come here," Aitken
said. "We'll win it back for keeps,
j After all, we won it last year, didn't
| we?"
