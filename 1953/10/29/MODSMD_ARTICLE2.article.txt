# California May 'Mix' Rooters
## 
### 
The University of California's tra
ditional men's rooting section, which
has often been criticized for its ob
streperous behavior at Berkeley
football games, may become a
"mixed" section if its conduct does
not improve in the future.
The announcement was made this
week by the Associated Students of
the University of California, who
.said they considered making the
section a coeducational one because
of complaints received about the
section after last Saturday's encoun
ter with the USC Trojans.
The ASUC said it had received a
$45 bill for glasses broken by a
thrown rooter's card. Another card,
it said, cut a girl's face near the
eye.
And.it further reported, three
liquor bottles were among the other
items thrown about in the rooters'
section.
Ralph Vetterlein, ASUC presi
dent, said he is meeting with rally
committees at UC to work out some
better methods of control in the
section.
Me added that a "mixed" section
may be necessary if there is no im
provement shown.
