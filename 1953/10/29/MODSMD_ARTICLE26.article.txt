# DAILY INTERVIEW
## West Assured Faith Of Japanese Leaders 
### HADLEY ROFF Editor, The Daily 
Assurance that most of the
leading political parties in Japan
are loyally pro-Western was
given on campus yesterday by
Hitoshi Ashida, leader of Japan's
Progressive Party and former
prime minister of that country.
The small and distinguished look
ing official told The Daily in an ex
elusive interview that his party par
ticularly was anxious to co-operate
in the American - led program of
collective security.
He said he definitely favored re
armament for his country, an aim
bitterly contested by leftist groups
in Japan.
But in rearming, he insisted, Ja
pan must make clear to its Asian
neighbors that its purpose is solely
defensive.
Prime Minister through most of
1948, Ashida is leader of what he
calls the "middle of the road" party
in Japan.
The most difficult domestic prob
lem now facing Japan, according to
Ashida, is the nation's economy. He
discounted, however, that an armi
stice in Korea might adversely af
fect the Japanese economy.
The gray-haired, thin-mustachcd
former prime minister visited Stan
ford as part of a tour of American
colleges made during the month. He
came to the United States at the
outset of this month to attend an
Inter-Parliamenary Union held in
Washington.
He leaves for Tokyo by air this
afternoon.
Many of the remarks made dur
ing the interview were amplified
when ho addressed a gathering of
political science instructors and
students in West Memorial Li
brary yesterday at 2 p.m.
During his lecturc, he reiterated
his belief that the majority of po
litical leaders in his homeland arc
pro-American and arc willing to
co-operate in a collective security

Though out that Japan
. . ~i.Â» . close relations with
America,"he said that, at the same
time, it must be judicious in its re
lations with the countries of Asia.
Of Communist China, he said that
though the Yoshida government
yet has made no overture toward
recognition, such a move might In
come necessary because of growing
economic pressures.
He maintained, however, that
recognition would have to lie
''prefaced with a statement <>l
good intentions" on the part of the
Reds.
He concluded by saying that many
Japanese are somewhat fearful that
Americans intend to abandon Ihrir
faith in the principle of collective
security and in the United Nation-..
This, he indicated, has given rise to
the supposition that there is a stron:;
anti-American sentiment preval< oL
among the Japanese.
