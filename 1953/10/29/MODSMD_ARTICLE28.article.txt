# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHG 
FROM HERE TO INFIRMITY
I didn't mind it when two bees ambushed me at the
Cellar and scored direct hits. I didn't, mind it when
I got a $2 ticket for "parking crooked." I didn't mind
it when the Chappie took a crack at me.
I didn't mind it when I had to pay a $2.40 library

fine for a pamphlet that was worth
15 cents. I didn't even mind it
when two profs pronounced my
name Growth instead of Grotay.
But I did mind a letter that I
received yesterday. I minded it,
because it was marked "Selective
Service." And for a number of
.years, I have suspected that the
j.'entlemen down at Draft Board
r>7 don't have my best interests at

heart.
I particularly minded i( when I read, "The above
registrant has been found physically lit for induction
into the armed services of the United States."
I submit that the above is a somewhat disconcerting
: entence. Although I was assured that I would be
able to finish the school year, I keep thinking about
those scenes in "From Here to Eternity," and 1 don't
mean the part where Burt Lancaster and Deborah
Kerr are smooching it up in the Waikiki waves.
Unfortunately, I come from a very physically-fit
family tree. Not since my great-grandfather died at the
age of 95 from sliding into third base has there been
any ill health in the family.
But if I were unfit, I don't know how the draft board
could have told, because the physical examination was
a bigger joke than a psych major in an advanced en
gineering course.
At 7:40 on a recent chilly morn, a herd of fellow
Draft Board 57 inmates and 112 were pushed into a
hus and driven to the City for the physical. At the

induction center, a bull-necked sergeant in a dog
brown uniform ordered us into line.
The first test was the blood test. "Hold out your
arm," mumbled the tester, looking at a conversation
pal to his right.
"Oops, so sorry, I missed your vein," he said, pulling
oi4 the needle and trying all over again.
"Until two days ago I was an automobile mechanic,
and I'm kind of new at this racket," he explained as he
missed the vein again. He hit it the third time, though.
Feeling like a refugee from Stalag 17, I stumbled
into the next room where the eye tests were being
administered. The poor guy ahead of me had glasses
thick as coke bottles; and couldn't even find (he
chart when he was told to remove his glasses. When
he was ordered to put his glasses back on, he had to
grope around to find them. 4F? No, his sight was
marked okay.
The hearing tester asked me, "Can you hear me?"
"Yes."
"Okoy, your hearing is all right; go to the next
room."
"But Mr., er, I mean Sir, I have two punctured ear
drums and . .
"You heard me, go to the next room!"
"Urp," I allowed, giving up my end of the conver
sation.
Six hours and 22 tests later I met the same bull
necked sergeant in the same dog-food brown uni
form.
"And what branch of the service would you pre
fer?" he queried.
"Well, really, Sir," I said, "I've been thinking the
whole thing over, and it strikes me that my particular
interests lie in endeavors not connected with the
armed forces."
"Infantry," he wrote down.
Damn Russians and their damn cold war.
