# ACADEMIC FREEDOM IN DANCER?
## Investigations, Loyalty Oaths, Censors Are Viewed by Stanford, AAU, AAUP

(Editor's note: This is the first
of a series of two articles out
lining the history of the academic
freedom issue at Stanford.)

Associate Editor, The Daily
Again last night the Execu
tive Committee took measures
to continue study of a problem
that this campus and the nation
have been facing for the past
several years—the possibility
that the university's traditional
academic freedom is in danger.
Many Stanford faculty members
and students have noted with grow
ii g alarm such recent events as the
University of California loyalty
oaths, the Velde committees' inves
tigation into professors' opinions,
the Los Angeles attack on UNESCO,
and the many attempts on the part
of school boards at textbook censor
ship.
Stanford voices have not been
quiet in the controversy over the
extent to which popular opinion
should dictate a professor's opinions.
Stanford President J. E. Wal
lace Sterling was one of five uni
versity presidents who worked
six months last year preparing
and writing a policy statement on
"The Rights and Responsibilities
of Universities and Their Facul
ties" for the American Associa
tion of Universities.
The AAU statement, published
t. March, was followed in May by
a ;ccond policy statement on aca
demic freedom, this one from the
Stanford chapter of the American
A ociation of University Professors
the AAUP — a national group
v. hieh represents university profes
sors just as the AAU represents
university presidents.
Both the AAU and the AAUP
latements stressed the need for

freedom of expression on university
faculties.
"A university must be hospitable
to an infinite variety of skills and
viewpoints relying upon open com
petition among them as the surest
safeguard of truth,"the AAU re
port stated. "Its whole spirit re
quires criticism, and
presentation of ideas in an atmos
phere of freedom and mutual con
fidence."
Although the AAU and the
AAUP resolutions agreed in sub
stance on almost every issue in
volved in the questions of aca
demic freedom and responsibility,
the two resolutions did differ in
the relative stress they placed on
different means of preserving aca
demic freedom.
The AAU report emphasized
strongly that no Communist has a
right to a university position.
"Above all, a scholar must have in
tegrity and independence," the re
port baid. "This renders impossible
adherence to such a regime as that
of Russia and its satellites."
The AAUP, although not main
taining the right of Communists to
university positions, placed stress on
the principle that "the tests of the
fitness of a college teacher should
be his integrity and his professional
competence as demonstrated in in
struction and research."
The AAU felt strongly that the
professor who invokes the Fifth
Amendment against self-incrimina
tion in refusing to answer questions
should bear a heavy burden of proof
of his fitness to continue teaching.
The AAUP, although never rec
ommending invocation of the Fifth
Amendment, placed more stress
on the principle that invocation of
the amendment is not in itself au
tomatic grounds for dismissal.
The AAU emphasized the respon
sibility of universities to the public
and urged universities to co-oper
ate with legislative inquiries.

Abuses in procedure should be dealt
with, the AAU believed, by appeal
ing to public opinion rather than by
non-co-operation or defiance.
The report insisted, however, that
"Unless a faculty member violates a
law, however, his discipline or dis
charge is a university responsibility
and should not be assumed by po
litical authority."
The AAUP's protest against such
legislative inquiries was more out
spoken. "We strongly deplore cur
rent investigations into the political
opinions and associations of univer
sity professors, and the use of Con
gressional and legislative authority
for such investigations," their reso
lution read.
Dr. Sterling himself in a speech
made in Los Angeles on March 22
said, "In so far as people say that
the university is resisting investi
gation to shield Communists, such
resistance is to be condemned. In
so far as such resistance is direct
ed to protection of the responsible
freedom which the university
must have to preserve its func
tions that resistance should be ap
plauded and upheld."
Stanford became directly involved
in the controversy over legislative
loyalty investigations last May. At
that time it was learned that Piich
ard E. Combs, chief counsel for the
California State Senate Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee, had testi
fied before a U.S. Senate internal
subcommittee in March that every
major California university em
ployed an experienced counter-
Communist agent on its faculty.
Dr. Sterling immediately issued a
strong denial of the truth of Combs'
testimony. "Stanford does not have
any undercover agents in its employ
to investigate the faculty," he de
clared, adding that the University
had never co-operated with Combs'
committee in the way that his tes
timony had indicated.

stance on almost every issue in
volved in the questions of aca
demic freedom and responsibility,
the two resolutions did differ in
the relative stress they placed on
different means of preserving aca
demic freedom.
The AAU report emphasized
strongly that no Communist has a
right to a university position.
"Above all, a scholar must have in
tegrity and independence," the re
port baid. "This renders impossible
adherence to such a regime as that
of Russia and its satellites."
The AAUP, although not main
taining the right of Communists to
university positions, placed stress on
the principle that "the tests of the
fitness of a college teacher should
be his integrity and his professional
competence as demonstrated in in
struction and research."
The AAU felt strongly that the
professor who invokes the Fifth
Amendment against self-incrimina
tion in refusing to answer questions
should bear a heavy burden of proof
of his fitness to continue teaching.
The AAUP, although never rec
ommending invocation of the Fifth
Amendment, placed more stress
on the principle that invocation of
the amendment is not in itself au
tomatic grounds for dismissal.
The AAU emphasized the respon
sibility of universities to the public
and urged universities to co-oper
ate with legislative inquiries.

Abuses in procedure should be dealt
with, the AAU believed, by appeal
ing to public opinion rather than by
non-co-operation or defiance.
The report insisted, however, that
"Unless a faculty member violates a
law, however, his discipline or dis
charge is a university responsibility
and should not be assumed by po
litical authority."
The AAUP's protest against such
legislative inquiries was more out
spoken. "We strongly deplore cur
rent investigations into the political
opinions and associations of univer
sity professors, and the use of Con
gressional and legislative authority
for such investigations," their reso
lution read.
Dr. Sterling himself in a speech
made in Los Angeles on March 22
said, "In so far as people say that
the university is resisting investi
gation to shield Communists, such
resistance is to be condemned. In
so far as such resistance is direct
ed to protection of the responsible
freedom which the university
must have to preserve its func
tions that resistance should be ap
plauded and upheld."
Stanford became directly involved
in the controversy over legislative
loyalty investigations last May. At
that time it was learned that Piich
ard E. Combs, chief counsel for the
California State Senate Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee, had testi
fied before a U.S. Senate internal
subcommittee in March that every
major California university em
ployed an experienced counter-
Communist agent on its faculty.
Dr. Sterling immediately issued a
strong denial of the truth of Combs'
testimony. "Stanford does not have
any undercover agents in its employ
to investigate the faculty," he de
clared, adding that the University
had never co-operated with Combs'
committee in the way that his tes
timony had indicated.

Again last night the Execu
tive Committee took measures
to continue study of a problem
that this campus and the nation
have been facing for the past
several years—the possibility
that the university's traditional
academic freedom is in danger.
Many Stanford faculty members
and students have noted with grow
ii g alarm such recent events as the
University of California loyalty
oaths, the Velde committees' inves
tigation into professors' opinions,
the Los Angeles attack on UNESCO,
and the many attempts on the part
of school boards at textbook censor
ship.
Stanford voices have not been
quiet in the controversy over the
extent to which popular opinion
should dictate a professor's opinions.
Stanford President J. E. Wal
lace Sterling was one of five uni
versity presidents who worked
six months last year preparing
and writing a policy statement on
"The Rights and Responsibilities
of Universities and Their Facul
ties" for the American Associa
tion of Universities.
The AAU statement, published
t. March, was followed in May by
a ;ccond policy statement on aca
demic freedom, this one from the
Stanford chapter of the American
A ociation of University Professors
the AAUP — a national group
v. hieh represents university profes
sors just as the AAU represents
university presidents.
Both the AAU and the AAUP
latements stressed the need for

freedom of expression on university
faculties.
"A university must be hospitable
to an infinite variety of skills and
viewpoints relying upon open com
petition among them as the surest
safeguard of truth,"the AAU re

quires criticism, and
presentation of ideas in an atmos

Stanford became directly involved
in the controversy over legislative
loyalty investigations last May. At
that time it was learned that Piich
ard E. Combs, chief counsel for the
California State Senate Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee, had testi
fied before a U.S. Senate internal
subcommittee in March that every
major California university em
ployed an experienced counter-
Communist agent on its faculty.
Dr. Sterling immediately issued a
strong denial of the truth of Combs'
testimony. "Stanford does not have
any undercover agents in its employ
to investigate the faculty," he de
clared, adding that the University
had never co-operated with Combs'
committee in the way that his tes
timony had indicated.

Again last night the Execu
tive Committee took measures
to continue study of a problem
that this campus and the nation
have been facing for the past
several years—the possibility
that the university's traditional
academic freedom is in danger.
Many Stanford faculty members
and students have noted with grow
ii g alarm such recent events as the
University of California loyalty
oaths, the Velde committees' inves
tigation into professors' opinions,
the Los Angeles attack on UNESCO,
and the many attempts on the part
of school boards at textbook censor
ship.
Stanford voices have not been
quiet in the controversy over the
extent to which popular opinion
should dictate a professor's opinions.
Stanford President J. E. Wal
lace Sterling was one of five uni
versity presidents who worked
six months last year preparing
and writing a policy statement on
"The Rights and Responsibilities
of Universities and Their Facul
ties" for the American Associa
tion of Universities.
The AAU statement, published
t. March, was followed in May by
a ;ccond policy statement on aca
demic freedom, this one from the
Stanford chapter of the American
A ociation of University Professors
the AAUP — a national group
v. hieh represents university profes
sors just as the AAU represents
university presidents.
Both the AAU and the AAUP
latements stressed the need for

freedom of expression on university
faculties.
"A university must be hospitable
to an infinite variety of skills and
viewpoints relying upon open com
petition among them as the surest
safeguard of truth,"the AAU re
port stated. "Its whole spirit re
quires criticism, and
presentation of ideas in an atmos
phere of freedom and mutual con
fidence."
Although the AAU and the
AAUP resolutions agreed in sub
stance on almost every issue in
volved in the questions of aca
demic freedom and responsibility,
the two resolutions did differ in
the relative stress they placed on
different means of preserving aca
demic freedom.
The AAU report emphasized
strongly that no Communist has a
right to a university position.
"Above all, a scholar must have in
tegrity and independence," the re
port baid. "This renders impossible
adherence to such a regime as that
of Russia and its satellites."
The AAUP, although not main
taining the right of Communists to
university positions, placed stress on
the principle that "the tests of the
fitness of a college teacher should
be his integrity and his professional
competence as demonstrated in in
struction and research."
The AAU felt strongly that the
professor who invokes the Fifth
Amendment against self-incrimina
tion in refusing to answer questions
should bear a heavy burden of proof
of his fitness to continue teaching.
The AAUP, although never rec
ommending invocation of the Fifth
Amendment, placed more stress
on the principle that invocation of
the amendment is not in itself au
tomatic grounds for dismissal.
The AAU emphasized the respon
sibility of universities to the public
and urged universities to co-oper
ate with legislative inquiries.

Abuses in procedure should be dealt
with, the AAU believed, by appeal
ing to public opinion rather than by
non-co-operation or defiance.
The report insisted, however, that
"Unless a faculty member violates a
law, however, his discipline or dis
charge is a university responsibility
and should not be assumed by po
litical authority."
The AAUP's protest against such
legislative inquiries was more out
spoken. "We strongly deplore cur
rent investigations into the political
opinions and associations of univer
sity professors, and the use of Con
gressional and legislative authority
for such investigations," their reso
lution read.
Dr. Sterling himself in a speech
made in Los Angeles on March 22
said, "In so far as people say that
the university is resisting investi
gation to shield Communists, such
resistance is to be condemned. In
