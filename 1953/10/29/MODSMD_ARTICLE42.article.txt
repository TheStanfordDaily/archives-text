The December issue of Sport Magazine has an article titled "Is Stanford
Through A.s a College Grid Power?" The story is written by Jim Scott,
sports editor of the Berkeley Gazette. "The one-time football stronghold is
crumbling," it headlines, "and nobody seems to care."
According to Athletic Department officials, this is only one of a series of
unfortunate relationships between Stanford and Scott. The most recent
incident before this article was a story ghost-written in Parade, "Why I
Quit College Football," by Bob Mathias.
Athletic Director A 1 Masters brands many of the accusations ridiculous.
"The best answer is to look where we are in the standings right now," he
said.
The main argument of Scott, that Stanford has not won the Big Game
since 1940, ignores the fact that two of the last six games were extremely
close. Masters also pointed out that in a good many of those years, nobody
else was defeating the Bears either.
"If he must complain about something, why doesn't he talk about the
California track situation?" The Bears haven't defeated USC in close to 25
years.
As to the comment that former Stanford star Jim Reynolds was "miffed
at . . . Masters' refusal to step up the football" pace," the athletic director
said, "That's the first I've ever heard of it."
"Stanford is trying to adhere to the PCC Conference rules, and it is my
opinion that we do so to a much fuller degree than most schools," he said.

Now that the cry "Why doesn't Stanford get better athletes than they
do" has been silenced for a while (at least until we lose our next football
game), it might be a good time to answer that question. Card fans who get
tired of watching the California football team, the UCLA basketball team,
and the USC track team consistently defeat the Indians must wonder what
charm these schools hold that our school, with its outstanding campus and
curriculum, does not.
The Athletic Department has some Statistics that were compiled recently
from a PCC survey of football and basketball players.
They show:
1. Stanford athletes, as a group, are only 0.07 of a grade point below the
all-University grade-point average for men. This is the best record in the
conference.
2. Only 19.1 per cent of Stanford football and basketball players have
grade-point averages below 2.0, while the Conference average is 30 per
cent. Stanford easily has the best record in the Conference.
3. The all-university average at Stanford for students who graduate is
approximately 70 per cent. This is the second highest percentage in the
nation, the highest being held by an Ivy League school.
4. But in recent years 70.3 per cent of those football and basketball
players who have enrolled at Stanford long enough to graduate have done
so. This is the highest percentage of any PCC school in California, and second
highest in the Conference.
5. Only 10.6 per cent of players eligible to graduate have dropped out,
which is the lowest, in the Conference.
(J. The apparent discrepancy in these last two figures is due to the fact
that 7.1 per cent of Stanford football and basketball players are attending
extra quarters in order to obtain degrees requiring extra time, such as
Engineering and Law. Thus, 83.4 per cent eventually graduate, which is
the highest in the Conference. â–º
7. Thus, while 70 per cent of all enrolled students eventually graduate,
athletes graduate at an 83.4 percentage. Our athletes do better than our
other students and they are studying in an environment where th primary
purpose is to study and graduate.
These facts demonstrate the following:
(1) Students at Stanford who participate in athletics do as well aca
demically as students who do not.
(2) Stanford is conducting an athletic program which does not demand
ail excessive amount of the student's time (otherwise it would show up
academically).
(3) Students who participate in athletics at Stanford not only graduate
in greater numbers than students who do not, but they are not handicapped
in their studies, despite the high academic standards maintained.
With so many unofficial rumors circulating about Card athletes, these
figures certainly are encouraging. All of these statistics could be explained
il athletes were allowed to take so-called "cinch" courses, as they are at
many other schools.
But, as students who have been here for some time can tell you, there
are no "cinch" courses in our curriculum. Or else, if there are, we know a
lot of people who would appreciate being told about them.
So, the next time a Stanford team is beaten, 54-7, fans will be able to look
at these statistics and rationalize the defeat.
