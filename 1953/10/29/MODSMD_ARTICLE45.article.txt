Jim Gaugh'ran, co-captain of the
Stanford water polo team, was se
lected Daily Athlete of the Week in
a poll of the sports writers.
Gaughran, a senior pre-law ma
jor, was chosen as a result of his
superlative play from the sprint po
sition in the USC and Fullerton JC j
games last Friday and Saturday.
He scored seven goals Friday as
the Indians wrecked SC. 17-5, and
countered with three more in the
11-8 victory over Fullerton.
Coach Tom Haynie heartily en
dorsed the choice, naming Gaugh- I

ran as "one of the three or four
best water polo players we've
ever had at Stanford."
"Besides his tremendous scoring
ability, he has a quiet way of run
ning the team that makes my job
easier," said Haynie.
Gaughran, who played high school
ball at Sequoia High in Redwood
City, has scored 26 goals in six
games this season, including 15 in
the three conference games to lead
the PCC in scoring.
Named to the All - Conference
water polo team last year, Gaugh
ran is also the top sprinter on the
swimming team. He won both the
50- and 100-yard freestyle races
in last spring's PCC champion
ships.
Jim narrowly missed an even
greater honor in 1952 when the
Whittier Swim Club, for which he
was playing forward, lost by one
point to the El Segundo Club in the
finals of the United States Olympic
water polo trials.
