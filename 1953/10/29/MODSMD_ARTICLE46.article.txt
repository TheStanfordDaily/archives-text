# Papooses to Tackle Cal Frosh Saturday
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman footballers will
roll into combat for the first time this
season Saturday morning at 11 in the
Stadium against the California frosh.
Coach Bob Ghilotti's gridders are
restricted to five weeks of practice
and two games by a new Pacific Coast
Conference ruling. The Papooses will
face Cal in the other game in two
weeks at Berkeley.
The Indian frosh expect a tough
afternoon from Cal quarterback Ron
nie Knox, a high school All-Ameri
can from Santa Monica.
