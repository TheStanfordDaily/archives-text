# Indian Water Polo Team Rips San Jose State, 16-4
## 
### 
Tom Haynie's varsity water polo
team rolled on to its sixth straight
victory yesterday, swamping an out
manned San Jose State squad, 16-4.
With the Cards leading 3-1 at the
end of the first quarter, Jim Lee
paced a seven-goal second quarter
, uprising. The burly senior from San
I Francisco fired in four goals from
I all parts of the pool to thoroughly
j bewilder the Spartan goalie.
Haynie inserted a team of reserves
! to start the second half, with sur
prising success. Bob Berglund and
Tad Devine each fired in two goals,
while defensive specialists Dick Flut
ter and Karl Brenner held the San
Joseans to two goals, one of those
a penalty shot.
Also enjoying the plaudits of the
crowd was reserve goalie Ed Barr,
who settled down after a bit of
uarly nervousness, to play an out
standing game. Off his play in the
last three games, Barr looks to be
one of the top assets of next year's
ball club.
Lee and Jim Gaughran, team co
captains, topped the scoring with
five goals apiece, while Devine,
Berglund, and Irwin Johnson each
had two to round out the scoring.
In a wild preliminary to the var
sity contest, the San Jose and In
dian freshman teams battled to an
eight-all tie, with the Spartans
coming from behind a 5-1 deficit.

Denny Stimson had five tallies for
the yearlings.
