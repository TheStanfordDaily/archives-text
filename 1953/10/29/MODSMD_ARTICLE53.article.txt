stacks under the direction of Edwin Leiser, principal library
assistant. He is reminding her to be sure to check out when
she is finished.

LAST STEP —Melissa is shown checking her book out from
Mrs. Smith at the circulation desk. She will be allowed to keep
it until two weeks from the Friday following the day she
checked it out.

the directory which is the
guide to the correct floor.
There are six floors in the
stacks, three below and two
