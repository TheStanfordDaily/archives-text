# 'While Slavery'
## 
### 
White slavery? Sure, but all in a
good cause.
Six Stillman House sophomores
were sold in bondage to members of
the Delta Tau Delta fraternity yes
terday to raise money for the World
University Service fund drive.
The sextette was bound and
gagged and stood on a dining room
table as the Delts bid $4.75 for one
hour of their services. The white
slaves were engaged to dry dishes,
sweep floors, and clear dishes
