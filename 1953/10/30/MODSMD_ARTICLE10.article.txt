# ACADEMIC FREEDOM HISTORY
## Excom Study of Investigations Prompted By Student Petition 
### 
By BARBARA TUERK
Associate Editor, The Daily
Neither the Stanford student
body nor the faculty has yet
published a statement uphold
ing the principle of academic
freedom.
But the question of whether to
frame such a declaration has been
popping up on campus often since
last January, when the Velde Com
mittee announced its intention to in
vestigate for subversives in the uni
versities.
When the question first arose last
January, the Executive Committee
voted not to take any action on aca
demic freedom. At that time Excom
believed that no statement could
represent the views of all, the stu
df nts, and that any action would be
uncalled for.
Excom reconsidered that decision
in May, and appointed a special
Academic Freedom Committee to
•tudy the related principles of aca
demic freedom and academic re
sponsibility, and to frame a state
ment of student policy on these
issues.
Excom's action was prompted by
the circulation on campus of a peti
tion which strongly protested legis
lative investigations of universities.
That petition, framed by a group
of students who studied the ques
tion independently all during winter
quarter, was signed by 453 students
before being mailed to President J.
E Wallace Sterling with a letter ask
ing that he consider it in formula
ting an official University stand on j
academic freedom.
That statement read in part:
"We object to any action by the
national or stale governments
which will limit academic freedom
and impoverish our education. Al-

| though we do not challenge the
| legal right of Congress to investi
gate in the universities, we protest
the current investigations because
they can result only in harm to our
' educational system."
Excom first passed a resolution
that the anti-investigations petition
did not represent the official opinion

at Stanford.

of the Stanford student body, then I
appointed its own Academic Free- '
! dom Committee.
Excom's committee included mem- j
bers from Excom and from the group j
' which framed the first petition. That
! committee held several open dis
cussion meetings before the end of
the quarter, and suggested that five
questions be answered before an of
ficial statement of student opinion
was framed.
Those questions are:
1. Are the universities carrying
out their community responsibili
ties?
2. Should a person not be allow
ed to teach because he is a Com- j
! munist?
3. Do we favor the investiga
tions of the political beliefs and
affiliations of university professors
by legislative investigating com
! Mit tees?
4. What are««the rights and re
sponsibilities of students? What !
| are the rights and responsibilities i
| of professors?
5. Is there an essential danger
| now to academic freedom?
An active program of study and
discussion on academic freedom
sponsored by summer quarter Ex

com was climaxed by a well-attended
debate in Cubberley Auditorium.
Students filled the hall to hear
four well-known Bay Area speakers
in a free-wheeling exchange on,
I "Resolved: That Legislative Com
: mittees Should Investigate Commu
j nist Influence in Universities."
Wheaton Brewer, executive adver
j tising director for the California
I Farmer and an ex-lieutenant colonel
I of the Army, started a mild campus
j uproar when he claimed, '"I could
quote from the faculty of this Uni- I
! versity the names of many members '
whose motives are open to question." !
That statement, which he de
i clared was backed by a just-pub
| lished report of the "Dilworth" in
vestigative committee of the Cali
fornia State Legislature was sharply
denied by members of the faculty
and the administration.
A spokesman for the University
said he was "unaware of any com
mittee called the Dilworth com
mittee. If the speaker was refer-# I
ring to the Burns committee, of
which Dilworth is a member, the
recent Burns report makes no such
reference to Stanford faculty mem
, hers. The only reference is a com- j
pliment to Stanford and all uni
! versities of the state for their co
! operation with the committee."
Summer Excom concluded its ac
! tivities by recommending that the
task of framing an academic free
j dom statement be left for the regular
Excom this fall.
i
j Meantime faculty study of the ac
j ademic freedom situation was being
! carried on simultaneously with the
j student discussions.
A special 15-man,faculty academic
freedom committee appointed by Dr.
Sterling last January finished its
I work this summer, and has formu
lated a faculty policy statement for !
the guidance of the president.

Neither the Stanford student
body nor the faculty has yet
published a statement uphold
ing the principle of academic
freedom.
But the question of whether to
frame such a declaration has been
popping up on campus often since
last January, when the Velde Com
mittee announced its intention to in
vestigate for subversives in the uni
versities.
When the question first arose last
January, the Executive Committee
voted not to take any action on aca
demic freedom. At that time Excom
believed that no statement could
represent the views of all, the stu
df nts, and that any action would be
uncalled for.
Excom reconsidered that decision
in May, and appointed a special
Academic Freedom Committee to
•tudy the related principles of aca
demic freedom and academic re
sponsibility, and to frame a state
ment of student policy on these
issues.
Excom's action was prompted by
the circulation on campus of a peti
tion which strongly protested legis
lative investigations of universities.
That petition, framed by a group
of students who studied the ques
tion independently all during winter
quarter, was signed by 453 students
before being mailed to President J.
E Wallace Sterling with a letter ask
ing that he consider it in formula
ting an official University stand on j
academic freedom.
That statement read in part:
"We object to any action by the
national or stale governments
which will limit academic freedom
and impoverish our education. Al-

| though we do not challenge the
| legal right of Congress to investi
gate in the universities, we protest
the current investigations because
they can result only in harm to our
' educational system."
Excom first passed a resolution
that the anti-investigations petition
did not represent the official opinion

of the Stanford student body, then I
appointed its own Academic Free- '
! dom Committee.
Excom's committee included mem- j
bers from Excom and from the group j
' which framed the first petition. That
! committee held several open dis
cussion meetings before the end of
the quarter, and suggested that five
questions be answered before an of
ficial statement of student opinion
was framed.
Those questions are:
1. Are the universities carrying
out their community responsibili
ties?
2. Should a person not be allow
ed to teach because he is a Com- j
! munist?
3. Do we favor the investiga
tions of the political beliefs and
affiliations of university professors
by legislative investigating com
! Mit tees?
4. What are««the rights and re
sponsibilities of students? What !
| are the rights and responsibilities i
| of professors?

Neither the Stanford student
body nor the faculty has yet
published a statement uphold
ing the principle of academic
freedom.
But the question of whether to
frame such a declaration has been
popping up on campus often since
last January, when the Velde Com
mittee announced its intention to in
vestigate for subversives in the uni
versities.
When the question first arose last
January, the Executive Committee
voted not to take any action on aca
demic freedom. At that time Excom
believed that no statement could
represent the views of all, the stu
df nts, and that any action would be
uncalled for.
Excom reconsidered that decision
in May, and appointed a special
Academic Freedom Committee to
•tudy the related principles of aca
demic freedom and academic re
sponsibility, and to frame a state
ment of student policy on these
issues.
Excom's action was prompted by
the circulation on campus of a peti
tion which strongly protested legis
lative investigations of universities.
That petition, framed by a group
of students who studied the ques
tion independently all during winter
quarter, was signed by 453 students
before being mailed to President J.
