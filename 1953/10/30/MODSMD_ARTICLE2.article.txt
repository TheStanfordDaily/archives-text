## 
### BARBARA TUERK Associate Editor, The Daily 
After two hours of spirited and
highly partisan debate that ram
bled all the way from civil rights to
the Air Force cuts, the students at
tending last night's Political Union
meeting decided by one vote that
the present administration's policies
are not anti-labor.
About 100 students met in Cub
berley Auditorium to hear San
Francisco s Democratic Congress
man John B. Shelley emphasize, "If
you believe strongly that acts and
not speeches tell the story, then the
acts of this administration lead one
to believe that the administration is
either anti-labor or is drifting to
ward an anti-labor program."
Shelley cited as proof of the ad
ministration's anti-labor policy its
failure to amend the Taft-Hartley
Law, the resignation of Secretary
of Labor Martin Durkin, its ap
pointments to the Federal Housing
Authority and the Bureau of Mine
Safety, and its failure to add to so
cial security.
Begg said that the Republicans
were the first to recognize the need
for change in the Taft-Hartley law,
and were stymied by the Democrats'
insistence on repeal or nothing.
He pointed out that the Democrats
had five"years in which to amend
the act, and said that they should
not criticize the Republicans for
"not rushing amendments through
in ten months."
He commended the White House
for its announced policy of staying
out of labor disputes.
