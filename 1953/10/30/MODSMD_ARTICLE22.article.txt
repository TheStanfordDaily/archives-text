# League-Leading Indians Tackle WSC
## Cougars, Led by Berry, Point for Upset Victory 
### PETE GROTHE Sports Editor, The Daily 
Like the maid who tries to
cover up a poorly made bed by
putting the bedspread on neat
ly, the Washington State Cou
gars will try to eradicate the
marks of a shabby record by
trouncing Pasadena - minded
Stanford.
The two teams lock horns tomor
row at 2 p.m. in Stanford's Big
Brown Bowl, and as an hors d'oeu
vre the Cal and Stanford frosh go at
11 a.m.
Cougar Coach A 1 Kircher's boys
have been romping around the
Northwest evergreens something
fierce this last week and practice,
and this is one reason why Frosh
Coach Bob Ghilotti remarked, "I
think that WSC has a better chance
of beating Stanford than USC or
Cal."
Ghilotti, who scouted the Cougars
in two games, is not one given to
making shocking statements, so his
words must be listened to. Why do
the intruders from the Northwest
pose such a serious threat to Stan

ford's Rose Bowl plans? Here are
some of the reasons:
1. Stanford can't be expected to
he as high for the Cougars as they
would he for teams, like UCLA or
USC. And at the same time, WSC
spirit will be at a fever pitch. If
you can't win the title yourself, the
next best thing is to kno<»k off the
guy who is supponsed to, and that's
what Kircher's men are aiming at.
The Cougars' confidence is ex
traordinary. They KNOW they
can take Stanford. They are a
team known for their ability to
find the enemy's weak spots and
then pick them apart. And.the
Indians have vulnerable points
that can be exploited.
2. Washington State has Wayne
Berry. Berry, a mercury - footed
half, is the man who makes the
Cougar attack go. He completed
eight out of ten passes against UC
LA. and he's the elusive-type tail
back who can go all the way at any
given distance.
3. The Cougars include in their
grid enrollment Duke Washington
and Vaughan Hitchcock, whom Ghi
lotti describes as "the two hardest-

White shirts will be required of
j all students planning to sit in the
, rooting section at the Washington
! State game tomorroow, Rally Com
I has announced.

I hitting fullbacks in the Pacific Coast
| Conference." This duo, who put
; three rugged UCLA linemen out of
! commission, gives WSC great down
j the-middle strength.
4. The Cougars have been tra
ditionally tough for Stanford. Last
; season the Cards won by the mar-
I gin -of a blocked conversion, 14 to
13, and have lost two WSC five
times while triumphing seven.
The visitors will be without the
services of their six-foot-eight end,
! Howie McCants, who has been play
i ing hookey. McCants disappeared
j after the UCLA game, and Kircher
won't reinstate him on the team
j until he gets the facts, ma'am.
The visitors have switched to the
I single wing, although 10 per cent of
their plays are still run from the
I "T." Here are WSC's scores: WSC
[ 7. Oregon 0; WSC 26, COP 20 (the
| same team that beat Stanford); WSC
30, Idaho 13; WSC 13, Southern Cal
29; WSC 12. lowa State 52; WSC 7,
i UCLA 44.
Naturally, the Indians are not
without motives to win this one.
They must, to stay in the Rose
Bowl race. They can talk about
de-emphasis all they want, and
desirable as it is, there are very
few players who don't want to
participate in the Rose Bowl.
A 1 so, the Indians would like to
take this one, if for no other rea-
I son than to answer Berkeley Jim
i Scott's ridiculous article, "Is Stan
ford Through as a Grid I'ower?"
Although the Cougars defensive
i halfs are known to be weak on pass
; defense, Chuck Taylor may elect to
stick to the ground. The emphasis
in practice this week has been run
ning offense, with stress on block
ing. Taylor would like to develop a
two - pronged attack to throw as
USC next week, and this is as good
a time as any to work on the run
j ning game.
There is a possibility that Jarvis
j Watson may *not start at fullback.
[ Watson has been resting a charley
i horse for the past three days, but he
! will definitely play. Marsh Howe,
the best defensive fullback on the
j team, will probably get the call.
Promising gridders like Joe Mo
reau, A 1 Napoleoij, Bill Tarr, John
Stewart, Chris Marshall, Joe Long,
Joel Sappenfield, and Tom McKen
; na should see considerable action.
Also. Taylor hopes that he'll be in a
position to put Jack Gebert and Don
I Kafka in at quarterback.

Cougar Coach A 1 Kircher's boys
have been romping around the
Northwest evergreens something
fierce this last week and practice,
and this is one reason why Frosh
Coach Bob Ghilotti remarked, "I
think that WSC has a better chance
of beating Stanford than USC or
Cal."
Ghilotti, who scouted the Cougars
in two games, is not one given to
making shocking statements, so his
words must be listened to. Why do
the intruders from the Northwest
pose such a serious threat to Stan

ford's Rose Bowl plans? Here are
some of the reasons:
1. Stanford can't be expected to
he as high for the Cougars as they
would he for teams, like UCLA or
USC. And at the same time, WSC
spirit will be at a fever pitch. If
you can't win the title yourself, the
next best thing is to kno<»k off the
guy who is supponsed to, and that's
what Kircher's men are aiming at.
The Cougars' confidence is ex
traordinary. They KNOW they
can take Stanford. They are a
team known for their ability to
find the enemy's weak spots and
then pick them apart. And.the
Indians have vulnerable points
that can be exploited.
2. Washington State has Wayne
Berry. Berry, a mercury - footed
half, is the man who makes the
Cougar attack go. He completed
eight out of ten passes against UC
LA. and he's the elusive-type tail
back who can go all the way at any
given distance.
3. The Cougars include in their
grid enrollment Duke Washington
and Vaughan Hitchcock, whom Ghi
lotti describes as "the two hardest-

White shirts will be required of
j all students planning to sit in the
, rooting section at the Washington
! State game tomorroow, Rally Com
I has announced.

I hitting fullbacks in the Pacific Coast
| Conference." This duo, who put
; three rugged UCLA linemen out of
! commission, gives WSC great down
j the-middle strength.
4. The Cougars have been tra
ditionally tough for Stanford. Last
; season the Cards won by the mar-
I gin -of a blocked conversion, 14 to
13, and have lost two WSC five
times while triumphing seven.
The visitors will be without the
services of their six-foot-eight end,
! Howie McCants, who has been play
i ing hookey. McCants disappeared
j after the UCLA game, and Kircher
won't reinstate him on the team
j until he gets the facts, ma'am.
The visitors have switched to the
I single wing, although 10 per cent of
their plays are still run from the
I "T." Here are WSC's scores: WSC
[ 7. Oregon 0; WSC 26, COP 20 (the
| same team that beat Stanford); WSC
30, Idaho 13; WSC 13, Southern Cal
29; WSC 12. lowa State 52; WSC 7,
i UCLA 44.
Naturally, the Indians are not
without motives to win this one.
They must, to stay in the Rose
Bowl race. They can talk about
de-emphasis all they want, and
desirable as it is, there are very
few players who don't want to
participate in the Rose Bowl.
A 1 so, the Indians would like to
take this one, if for no other rea-
I son than to answer Berkeley Jim
i Scott's ridiculous article, "Is Stan
ford Through as a Grid I'ower?"
Although the Cougars defensive
i halfs are known to be weak on pass
; defense, Chuck Taylor may elect to
stick to the ground. The emphasis
in practice this week has been run
ning offense, with stress on block
ing. Taylor would like to develop a
two - pronged attack to throw as
USC next week, and this is as good
a time as any to work on the run
j ning game.
There is a possibility that Jarvis
j Watson may *not start at fullback.
[ Watson has been resting a charley
i horse for the past three days, but he
! will definitely play. Marsh Howe,
the best defensive fullback on the
j team, will probably get the call.
Promising gridders like Joe Mo
reau, A 1 Napoleoij, Bill Tarr, John
Stewart, Chris Marshall, Joe Long,
Joel Sappenfield, and Tom McKen
; na should see considerable action.
Also. Taylor hopes that he'll be in a
position to put Jack Gebert and Don
I Kafka in at quarterback.

ford's Rose Bowl plans? Here are
some of the reasons:
1. Stanford can't be expected to
he as high for the Cougars as they
would he for teams, like UCLA or
USC. And at the same time, WSC
spirit will be at a fever pitch. If
you can't win the title yourself, the
next best thing is to kno<»k off the
guy who is supponsed to, and that's
what Kircher's men are aiming at.
The Cougars' confidence is ex
traordinary. They KNOW they
can take Stanford. They are a
team known for their ability to
find the enemy's weak spots and
then pick them apart. And.the
Indians have vulnerable points
that can be exploited.
2. Washington State has Wayne
Berry. Berry, a mercury - footed
half, is the man who makes the
Cougar attack go. He completed
eight out of ten passes against UC
LA. and he's the elusive-type tail
back who can go all the way at any
given distance.
3. The Cougars include in their
grid enrollment Duke Washington
and Vaughan Hitchcock, whom Ghi
lotti describes as "the two hardest-

White shirts will be required of
j all students planning to sit in the
, rooting section at the Washington
! State game tomorroow, Rally Com
I has announced.

I hitting fullbacks in the Pacific Coast
| Conference." This duo, who put
; three rugged UCLA linemen out of
! commission, gives WSC great down
j the-middle strength.
4. The Cougars have been tra
ditionally tough for Stanford. Last
; season the Cards won by the mar-
I gin -of a blocked conversion, 14 to
13, and have lost two WSC five
times while triumphing seven.
The visitors will be without the
services of their six-foot-eight end,
! Howie McCants, who has been play
i ing hookey. McCants disappeared
j after the UCLA game, and Kircher
won't reinstate him on the team
j until he gets the facts, ma'am.
The visitors have switched to the
I single wing, although 10 per cent of
their plays are still run from the
I "T." Here are WSC's scores: WSC
[ 7. Oregon 0; WSC 26, COP 20 (the
| same team that beat Stanford); WSC
30, Idaho 13; WSC 13, Southern Cal
29; WSC 12. lowa State 52; WSC 7,
i UCLA 44.
Naturally, the Indians are not
without motives to win this one.
They must, to stay in the Rose
Bowl race. They can talk about
de-emphasis all they want, and
desirable as it is, there are very
few players who don't want to
participate in the Rose Bowl.
A 1 so, the Indians would like to
take this one, if for no other rea-
I son than to answer Berkeley Jim
i Scott's ridiculous article, "Is Stan
ford Through as a Grid I'ower?"
Although the Cougars defensive
i halfs are known to be weak on pass
; defense, Chuck Taylor may elect to
stick to the ground. The emphasis
in practice this week has been run
ning offense, with stress on block
ing. Taylor would like to develop a
two - pronged attack to throw as
USC next week, and this is as good
a time as any to work on the run
j ning game.
There is a possibility that Jarvis
j Watson may *not start at fullback.
[ Watson has been resting a charley
i horse for the past three days, but he
! will definitely play. Marsh Howe,
the best defensive fullback on the
j team, will probably get the call.
Promising gridders like Joe Mo
reau, A 1 Napoleoij, Bill Tarr, John
Stewart, Chris Marshall, Joe Long,
Joel Sappenfield, and Tom McKen
; na should see considerable action.
Also. Taylor hopes that he'll be in a
position to put Jack Gebert and Don
I Kafka in at quarterback.
