# Frosh Gridders to Clash With Cal Cubs Tomorrow
## 
### VIC CASEBOLT 
A squad of about 60 Stanford
freshman footballers will make #
their debut in Stanford athletics
tomorrow morning when the
Farm's Papooses entertain the
Cal frosh in the first game of a
home-and-home series
I
Kickoff for the preliminary to the
varsity encounter is set for 11 in |
the Stadium. Two games with Cal :
are the only ones scheduled for the I
frosh this year.
According to Coach Bob Ghilotti,
the yearlings will field a "good rep- !
resentative freshman ball club." He
adds that the squad's spirit is at
a high pitch for the opener, but they
have > very little depth.
Papoose defenses, although con- i
structed along basic lines, will be \
aimed at stopping the passing arm j
of Ronnie Knox, the highly touted j
Cal frosh quarterback from Santa
Monica. Knox was picked on the
high school All - American first
string last year.
The rest of Cal's backfield has
both size and speed and will be
tough to stop, both on the ground
and in the air, according to reports
from Berkeley.
But Stanford's entrant in the
clash is not devoid of igood pros
pects either. The Papooses' back
field, although not extremely fast,
has plenty of speed, and the boys
seem to have a "good running
sense," according to Coach Ghi-

lotti.
Right halfhack Jim Noe, prob
ably the strongest all-around back
on the squad, stars at both Tun
ning and blocking assignments.
The left halfbacks can generally
be described as fast little backs,
with good deception. Hank Rol
dan, the probable starter, fits this
description, as does Mike Raftery,
a replacement who is slated to see
lots of action.
Tony Serra will be the Papooses J
fullback. At 185 pounds, he is the
heaviest man in the backfield, and
the frosh will be relying on him to
duck his head and drive up the
middle for consistent gains, a role
in which he has demonstrated con
siderable prowess in practice scrim
mages.
Quarterback Paul Camera, besides
possessing a strong passing arm, is a
running threat too.
Judging from practice, the left
side of the Papoose line may be the
stronger. Left tackle Donn Cars
well and left guard Don Manoukian
have turned in the outstanding line
performances in intra-squad scrim
mages. Both are good blockers and
tacklers.
Dale Smith and Charley Savio
will be called on to uphold the
right side of the line, at tackle
and guard respectively, and Tom
Kemp will handle the starting
center chores.
At the ends, Bob Gergen and
Ed McCellen show good pass
snagging ability and are both out
standing blockers.
