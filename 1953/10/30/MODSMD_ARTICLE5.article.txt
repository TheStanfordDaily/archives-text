# AIRLINER CRASHES ON PENINSULA MOUNTAIN
## Rescuers Remove 17 Bodies From Charred DC-6 Wreckage 
### DON WEBSTER 
Nineteen persons were killed yesterday morning when a DC-6 Brit
ish Commonwealth Pacific Airliner crashed and exploded on a fog-cov
ered hillside ten miles west of campus. When rescue operations were
halted last night, 17 bodies had been recoverd from the scattered wreck
age. Search for the remains of the other two victims will be resumed
this morning.
Among the dead was William Kapeil, internationally known American
pianist. Kapeil was the only American listed aboard.
Other passengers included six Australians, two Englishmen, one Ca
nadian, and one Scandinavian. All eight crew members were believed
to be Australians.
Cause of the crash is as yet undetermined. No distress message was
received from the plane before it plowed into the side of the almost in
accessible slope three miles west of Skyline near King's Mountain.
The plane, which look off from Sydney, Australia, last Tuesday and

stopped at Suva, Canton Island, and Honolulu, last contacted the CAA
tower at San Francisco International Airport at S:2!) a.m. and asked for
instrument landing instructions. A wristwatch found at the charred scene
had stopped at N:4B a.m.
All passengers were believed to have been killed instantly.
Because of the dense brush. Coast Guard and civilian rescue parties
were unable to reach the smoldering ruins until about 10 a.m.â€”an hour
after the crash was reported.
When bulldozers were unable to penetrate the forest growth, a party
of about 50 men climbed, crawled, and hacked its way to the wreckage.
On arriving they found nothing more than blackened, charred bodies
and sections of metal. Several persons were injured attempting to reach
the plane.
Officials of the BCPA were at a loss to explain the accident. The plane
was behind schedule due to heavy head winds over the Pacific, but no
trouble had been reported by the pilot.

Kapell, 31, was generally rated as one of the world's ten top pianists.
Having finished a Pacific tour, lie was Hying East to start a nationwide
tour which was to begin in Chicago in December and bring him to San
Francisco next March. Kapell appeared at Stanford on April 2(i, 11)50,
as a Concert Series artist.
BCPA is co-owned by the British, New Zealand, and Australian gov
ernments. The crash is reportedly the first in its five-year Pacific flight
history. The craft was a luxury, all-sleeper plane.
A rescue operations base was set up on a forest service road which
terminated about a mile from the crash area. Five helicopters, three
from the South San Francisco Coast Guard base and one each from local
Air Force and Navy bases, landed here, being unable to get any closer
to the wreckage. From this area ropes were lowered to help rescuers
in their climb up with the remains of the bodies.
Spreading flames from the wreckage offered a short-lived threat of
becoming a full-scale forest fire, but San Mateo County fire engines
aided Navy, Coast Guard, and sheriff's office workers in bringing the
flames under control.
Red Cross workers from local communities assisted operations by
supplying rescuers with coffee and sandwiches.
