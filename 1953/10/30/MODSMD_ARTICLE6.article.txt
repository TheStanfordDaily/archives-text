# On-the-Spot Accounts Tell Story of Air Disaster Scene
## Up Above—Just Smoke and Dust 
### PAT KING 
It wasn't a pleasant afternoon.
For over two hours I paced back :
and forth on a plot of land about the
size of Inner Quad, mingling with
all the people who had come to an
swer the call of disaster.
They were all there—the report
ers and photographers, airport res
cue workers and airline officials,
Red Cross ladies And curiosity
seekers. They had all trudged in
two dusty mil.es from Skyline Bou
levard to a small clearing in the ;
forest. They were all waiting—and j
looking down.
Two miles below smoke purled
up through the trees and blended
with the haze above. No scorched
patch of earth, no bits of metal, j
no covered litters. Nothing but ;
smoke to mark the spot where 19
people met violent death just a
few hours earlier.
At the center of operations all was
calm and efficient. San Mateo
County sheriffs deputies kept out
most of the "non-official" onlookers.
Coast Guard officers directed the
movements of two yellow helicop
ters which circled over the smolder
ing ruins. -
Rescue workers from United Air
Lines craVHed up and down the
rugged "trail" from the crash to
the clearing, bringing back empty
stretchers and the news "we'll have
to wait."
They had to wait for the bull
dozers to clear a road through the
underbrush, since trucks, not men,
were needed for the salvage opera
tion. There wasn't much a man
could salvage, except a handful of
ashes or a few silver splinters.
So they waited. K eportcrs
swapped information, photogra
phers took shots of the wavering
column «>f smoke, and everyone
in unc h e d on sandwiches and
gulped coffee provided by the Red
Cross.
Everywhere there was dust.
Whenever the helicopter took oft* or
landed with a migiity whir, clouds
of dust smothered the whole area.
There was dust in your eyes and
lungs and throat. There was dust in
the expensive flash - bulb cameras
and in the ham sandwiches and cof
fee. Once the landing area was
hosed off. But the dust remained.
Then there were the quick, sharp
impressions which will remain long
after all the dust has been washed
off. The local man in levis and cow
boy hat who had been the first to
pinpoint the scene of the crash for
the San Mateo sheriff's office.
Five high school boys leaning
against an ambulance, smoking and
laughing. The hardboiled reporter
who had gone "down below" and
come back too numb for words. The
white plastic zipper bags waiting to
be filled with ashes.
The swish of a helicopter's propel
lor. The fistful of charred letters
brought up by a rescue worker. The
neatly folded blankets piled on
carefully stacked stretchers.
The quiet of death.

smoke to mark the spot where 19
people met violent death just a
few hours earlier.
At the center of operations all was
calm and efficient. San Mateo
County sheriffs deputies kept out
most of the "non-official" onlookers.
Coast Guard officers directed the
movements of two yellow helicop
ters which circled over the smolder
ing ruins. -
Rescue workers from United Air
Lines craVHed up and down the
rugged "trail" from the crash to
the clearing, bringing back empty
stretchers and the news "we'll have
to wait."
They had to wait for the bull
dozers to clear a road through the
underbrush, since trucks, not men,
were needed for the salvage opera
tion. There wasn't much a man
could salvage, except a handful of
ashes or a few silver splinters.
So they waited. K eportcrs
swapped information, photogra
phers took shots of the wavering
column «>f smoke, and everyone
in unc h e d on sandwiches and
gulped coffee provided by the Red
Cross.
Everywhere there was dust.
Whenever the helicopter took oft* or
landed with a migiity whir, clouds
of dust smothered the whole area.
There was dust in your eyes and
lungs and throat. There was dust in
the expensive flash - bulb cameras
and in the ham sandwiches and cof
fee. Once the landing area was
hosed off. But the dust remained.
Then there were the quick, sharp
impressions which will remain long
after all the dust has been washed
off. The local man in levis and cow
boy hat who had been the first to
pinpoint the scene of the crash for
the San Mateo sheriff's office.
Five high school boys leaning
against an ambulance, smoking and
laughing. The hardboiled reporter
who had gone "down below" and
come back too numb for words. The
white plastic zipper bags waiting to
be filled with ashes.
The swish of a helicopter's propel
lor. The fistful of charred letters
brought up by a rescue worker. The
neatly folded blankets piled on
carefully stacked stretchers.
The quiet of death.
It wasn't a pleasant afternoon.
For over two hours I paced back :
and forth on a plot of land about the
size of Inner Quad, mingling with
all the people who had come to an
swer the call of disaster.
They were all there—the report
ers and photographers, airport res
cue workers and airline officials,
Red Cross ladies And curiosity
seekers. They had all trudged in
two dusty mil.es from Skyline Bou
levard to a small clearing in the ;
forest. They were all waiting—and j
looking down.
Two miles below smoke purled
up through the trees and blended
with the haze above. No scorched
patch of earth, no bits of metal, j
no covered litters. Nothing but ;
smoke to mark the spot where 19
people met violent death just a
few hours earlier.
