# Down Below— Charred Remains
## 
### WIN GRIFFITH 
I pushed through the brush and
stepped into the area of the crash
at about 2 p.m.
About 30 men were standing by
the sides of the wreckage. Their
faces and lips were quiet with dis
belief. They had no leader yet. They
could only stand silently and stare
at the smoking, ashen slope in front
of them.
They could see but it was hard
for them to believe. They could see
the twisted steel and the smoul
dering, charred bodies of the dead.
But it was hard for them to believe
that the steel had been an airplane
and the bodies had been living hu
man beings.
The leaders arrived, and the mer
began their work. Some of them
could not bear the sights and the
smells and had to leave. The resl
started poking through the steel and
rubble and ashes to find the remains
of 19 people.
Most of them cussed quietly a.'
they touched the rigid, black forms
of the dead. Their faces tightened as
they found a monogrammed hand
kerchief, a bracelet, or an identi
fication tag. And their hands trem
bled as they lifted the forms onto
stretchers —or placed them in bur
lap bags.
The talk was strained. A few
tried to joke. A few tried to be
casual. Most just bit their lips,
preferring silence.
Even the leaders, men used to dis
aster and tragedy, were depressed
by the dull yellow smoke and
thought of death. One man stopped
short in the middle ot a verbal order
and stood unmoving for five minutes
as he gazed at the body of a child.
Another suddenly dropped what
he was doing to move away from the
scene to be alone. He returned 15
minutes later, his eyes red and the
dust on his face streaked with tears.
Gradually, the job was being com
pleted. By 5 p.m. the wisps of smoke
■rising from the wreckage were dy
ing. Darkness aproached as the trail
back to the rescue landing was worn
by the feet of the last stretcher
bearers. The bodies of 17 persons had
been removed. Most of the men had
left the area. Only half a dozen re
mained behind to search the rubble
for the last of the dead.
One of the men paused in his work
to watch a helicopter hover' over
the area.
•It's great that we've got those

machines to help in the rescue," he
said. *
"Yeah." another answered cyni
cally, "it's jrreat that we've gut
those machines."

The talk was strained. A few
tried to joke. A few tried to be
casual. Most just bit their lips,
preferring silence.
Even the leaders, men used to dis
aster and tragedy, were depressed
by the dull yellow smoke and
thought of death. One man stopped
short in the middle ot a verbal order
and stood unmoving for five minutes
as he gazed at the body of a child.
Another suddenly dropped what
he was doing to move away from the
scene to be alone. He returned 15
minutes later, his eyes red and the
dust on his face streaked with tears.
Gradually, the job was being com
pleted. By 5 p.m. the wisps of smoke
■rising from the wreckage were dy
ing. Darkness aproached as the trail
back to the rescue landing was worn
by the feet of the last stretcher
bearers. The bodies of 17 persons had
been removed. Most of the men had
left the area. Only half a dozen re
mained behind to search the rubble
for the last of the dead.
One of the men paused in his work
to watch a helicopter hover' over
the area.
•It's great that we've got those

machines to help in the rescue," he
said. *
"Yeah." another answered cyni
cally, "it's jrreat that we've gut
those machines."
I pushed through the brush and
stepped into the area of the crash
at about 2 p.m.
About 30 men were standing by
the sides of the wreckage. Their
faces and lips were quiet with dis
belief. They had no leader yet. They
could only stand silently and stare
at the smoking, ashen slope in front
of them.
They could see but it was hard
for them to believe. They could see
the twisted steel and the smoul
dering, charred bodies of the dead.
But it was hard for them to believe
that the steel had been an airplane
and the bodies had been living hu
man beings.
The leaders arrived, and the mer
began their work. Some of them
could not bear the sights and the
smells and had to leave. The resl
started poking through the steel and
rubble and ashes to find the remains
of 19 people.
Most of them cussed quietly a.'
they touched the rigid, black forms
of the dead. Their faces tightened as
they found a monogrammed hand
kerchief, a bracelet, or an identi
fication tag. And their hands trem
bled as they lifted the forms onto
stretchers —or placed them in bur
lap bags.
