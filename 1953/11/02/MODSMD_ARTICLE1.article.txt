# Joint Chiefs Reportedly Seeking Troop Reductions
## 
### 
PARIS, Nov. 1 (UP) —The United States Joint Chiefs of Staff (all
official denials to the contrary notwithstanding) are considering
a 25 per cent reduction in the American armed forces and a sharp
cutback in the number of divisions stationed overseas, authori
tative U. S. sources said today.
The informants emphasized that no action is planned immedi-

ately, and that whatever the Joint
Chiefs recommend after surveying
atomic weapons development and
budgetary requiremeents would not
be applicable before fiscal 1955—and
then only after Presidential ap
proval.
Two members of the Joint Chiefs
are in Europe: the chairman, Ad
miral Arthur W. Radford, and the
Air Force Chief of StafT, Gen. Na
than Twining. Gen. Matthew B.
Ricigway, Army Chief of Staff, has
been in the Far East.
Differences among the Joint
Chiefs are reported. Ridgway,
former Supreme Allied Com
mander in Europe, is described as
conscious of the psychological ef
fects of current talk about pos
sible troop cutbacks of U.S.
ground forces in Europe.
He has the support of Gen. Alfred
M. Gruenther, his former Chief of
Staff and present SHAPE com
mander, who told Radford and
Twining early last week that the
present speculation about reduc
tions was havin an adverse effect in
Europe.
Gruenther recalled that the pro
fessional Cassandras and the Soviet
serving neutralists have been pre
dicting for years the United .States
would be unwilling to risk its fu
ture with that of Western Europe.
There is good reason to believe
Radford and Twining were sent to
Paris by President Eisenhower,
(lie first SHAPE commander, to
get "educated" about the Euro
pean viewpoints so that when a
final decision is taken in Washing
lon, ;<ll possible factors will have
been considered.
Radford and Twining, who have
been in Western Europe one week,
feel that Congress will not wait
much beyond Feb. 1 for France to
ratify the European Army Treaty
which will permit German rearma
ment.
If the French refuse the ratifica
tion, on which the United States has
based its foreign policy, then an
other method of getting German re
armament will be sought. The Unit
ed States will reconsider its entire
concept of world strategy.
