It is a lamentable fact that the
I world-famous cello-piano duo, Niko
j lai and Joanna Graudan, had to per
i form before a pitifully small audi
j ence in Cubberley Auditorium yes
-1 terday afternoon. In our estimation,
j the auditorium was about one-quar
| ter full.
In spite of the empty house, the
J Graudans nevertheless turned in as
j fine an afternoon of music as anyone
] could hope for. They are known as a
duo, and their perfect collaboration
attests to the fact that they do full
| justice to the term.
The sense of balance is so fine
that one could almost compare
them to one perfectly integrated
instrument with two different
voices. The piano was never sub
ordinated to (be cello as so often
i occurs when the cellist is the fea
tured soloist and (h<- pianist merely
the accompanist.
Opening with the Bach Sonata in
D, the Graudans immediately dis
played their mastery over this ma
ture and difficult work. Not only
; were the technical problems hand
led with ease, but the deep and
thought provoking musical qualities
were essayed with the sweep and
eloquence of masters.
The versatility and virtuosity of
the (iiaii'laii:s w;«s further demon
strated in their performance of the
Brahms Sonata in F. The Sonata
is a work of sustained power all
through its four movements. The
monumental structure of the first
movement alone offers enough dif
ficulties to make it the exclusive
possession of only a handful of
virtuosi. The Graudans are such
musicians.
The same virtuosity kept the De
bussy Sonata in D minor alive and
interesting. The Sonata has a tend
ency to fall apart at times in the
| hands of average musicians, but the
j Graudans made this minor Debussy
a very nice experience, since it is
not played very often.
The Beethoven Sonata in A was
I scheduled to conclude the program.
