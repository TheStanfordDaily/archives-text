# GARRETT DEALS CARDS ANOTHER WIN
## Tribe Smashes Records; Whips Cougars 48 to 19 
### PETE GROTHE Sports Editor, The Daily 
And Stanford came of age last Saturday.
Washington State had a Halloween party in the Stadium, and
with Bob Garrett, John Steinberg, and Sam Morley playing head
witches, Stanford frightened the Cougars right out of the lot, 48 to
19. It was a case of tricks and treats, with Stanford providing both.

Not among the least of the treat
was the Indian passing game, which
in the hazy Brown Bowl clicked
like it had never clicked before. A
Stanford record for passing yardngc.
was shattered as Garrett and hi:

chief lieutenant, Jack Gebert, went
via the ether for 341 yards.
This broke the record set by Gel<-
ert last year against Oregon 1121
yards.
But what was even more amaz
ing was the fantastic completion
rccord of 16 for 20. Garrett com
pleted 11 for 14 and Gebert live
for six. Most teams don't do that
well in warm-up practice.
And the manner in which those
passes were completed was just nr.
electrifying. At one point in the
game, Garrett was thrown for a 22-
yard loss on the 35. A penalty
moved the porker to the 40. Did
Garrett elect to kick on fourth ind
37 yards to go? No, he just wheeled
back, spotted Fresno's Bill Rogers
on the three, and hit him with pin
point accuracy.
At another time, he threw a pi , ,
that went 51 yards in the air to John
Steinberg.

a big day too as he connected on 5 out of 6 tosses. Another star dimmed by Garrett's brilliance
was A 1 Napoleon who flashed some of the stuff that made him an all-American junior college
ace last year. In the last quarter Gebert hit Napoleon on a flare-out pass and Napoleon galloped
into the end zone for the score. —Daily photo by Jack Tracy

Stadium turf last Saturday.
And just as (Jarrett was distin
guishing himself. John Steinberg,
the loose-jointed wingman from.
Short Hills. New Jersey, had his
greatest day. Steinberg, with his
tfreat hands, was snagging passes
all over the lot. And when he got
them, he knew what to do with
the ball, gobbling np ten yards
with each giant sride.
But at the beginning, we said that
Stanford came of age. And it did.
Not only did the Indians roll up the
highest point total since beating
USF, 55 to 7, in 1950. They also
showed their best blocking and
tackling of the season. The pass
protection, in particular, was almost
flawless.
Stanford came of age, because
for the first time this season, the
Indians fully established them
selves as favorites for the Rose
Bowl. Before, the experts had re
garded the Cards as just punk in
truders who had eked by UCLA by

I one point and lucked by Wash
ington. Now, the Indians had
grown muscles and were a her
culean threat.
The game, incidentally, was the
100 th football win in the PCC for a
Stanford team.
Many boys displayed brawny tal
ents last Saturday. The whole cen- :
ter of the line, Ted Tanner, Norm j
Manoogian, Phil Wilson, Matt Ar
mitage, and Win Wedge, were good.
A 1 Napoleon showed that he may be 1
Stanford's best breakaway threat, j
Rogers and newcomers Joe Moreau
and Dick Crepeau were impressive
in the backfield, and John Stewart
and Marv Tennefoss were impres- !
sive at ends.
Also, a pat on the back lor stand
bys Ron Cook and Ernie Dorn;
quarterback Don Kafka, who rolled
off a sweet bootleg scoring play; and
Len Doster, John Stanton, Dick
Gant, and Marsh Howe.
And so next week, it's down to
| the Coliseum to meet USC, of which
there is none more hated. One of

the most mammoth southern migra
tions in Farm history should take
place to see the game that could
decide the Rose Bowl.
The Indians will be favored. For
they came of age last Saturday.

100 th football win in the PCC for a
Stanford team.
Many boys displayed brawny tal
ents last Saturday. The whole cen- :
ter of the line, Ted Tanner, Norm j
Manoogian, Phil Wilson, Matt Ar
mitage, and Win Wedge, were good.
A 1 Napoleon showed that he may be 1
Stanford's best breakaway threat, j
Rogers and newcomers Joe Moreau
and Dick Crepeau were impressive
in the backfield, and John Stewart
and Marv Tennefoss were impres- !
sive at ends.
Also, a pat on the back lor stand
bys Ron Cook and Ernie Dorn;
quarterback Don Kafka, who rolled
off a sweet bootleg scoring play; and
Len Doster, John Stanton, Dick
Gant, and Marsh Howe.
And so next week, it's down to
| the Coliseum to meet USC, of which
there is none more hated. One of

the most mammoth southern migra
tions in Farm history should take
place to see the game that could
decide the Rose Bowl.
The Indians will be favored. For
they came of age last Saturday.
And Stanford came of age last Saturday.
Washington State had a Halloween party in the Stadium, and
with Bob Garrett, John Steinberg, and Sam Morley playing head
witches, Stanford frightened the Cougars right out of the lot, 48 to
19. It was a case of tricks and treats, with Stanford providing both.

Not among the least of the treat
was the Indian passing game, which
in the hazy Brown Bowl clicked
like it had never clicked before. A
Stanford record for passing yardngc.
was shattered as Garrett and hi:

chief lieutenant, Jack Gebert, went
via the ether for 341 yards.
This broke the record set by Gel<-
ert last year against Oregon 1121
yards.
But what was even more amaz
ing was the fantastic completion
rccord of 16 for 20. Garrett com
pleted 11 for 14 and Gebert live
for six. Most teams don't do that
well in warm-up practice.
And the manner in which those
passes were completed was just nr.
electrifying. At one point in the
game, Garrett was thrown for a 22-
yard loss on the 35. A penalty
moved the porker to the 40. Did
Garrett elect to kick on fourth ind
37 yards to go? No, he just wheeled
back, spotted Fresno's Bill Rogers
on the three, and hit him with pin
point accuracy.
At another time, he threw a pi , ,
that went 51 yards in the air to John
Steinberg.

19. It was a case of tricks and treats, with Stanford providing both.

Not among the least of the treat
was the Indian passing game, which
in the hazy Brown Bowl clicked
like it had never clicked before. A
Stanford record for passing yardngc.
was shattered as Garrett and hi:

chief lieutenant, Jack Gebert, went
via the ether for 341 yards.
This broke the record set by Gel<-
ert last year against Oregon 1121
yards.
But what was even more amaz
ing was the fantastic completion
rccord of 16 for 20. Garrett com
pleted 11 for 14 and Gebert live
for six. Most teams don't do that
well in warm-up practice.
And the manner in which those
passes were completed was just nr.
electrifying. At one point in the
game, Garrett was thrown for a 22-
yard loss on the 35. A penalty
moved the porker to the 40. Did
Garrett elect to kick on fourth ind
37 yards to go? No, he just wheeled
back, spotted Fresno's Bill Rogers
on the three, and hit him with pin
point accuracy.
At another time, he threw a pi , ,
that went 51 yards in the air to John
Steinberg.
Robert Garrett, the 190 - pound
senior from San Marino, firmly < -
tablished himself as the best throw
er in America on the floor of the


AERIAL CIRCUS —While Bob Garrett grabbed off the headlines, his replacement Jack Gebert had
a big day too as he connected on 5 out of 6 tosses. Another star dimmed by Garrett's brilliance
was A 1 Napoleon who flashed some of the stuff that made him an all-American junior college
ace last year. In the last quarter Gebert hit Napoleon on a flare-out pass and Napoleon galloped
into the end zone for the score. —Daily photo by Jack Tracy


COME TO PAPA—Sophomore end John Stewart gathers in a
Bob Garrett aerial and rambles to the Washington State 15. The
play covered 60 yards and was one of many long aerials Mr.
Garrett connected with as the Cards took one giant step toward
Pasadena by drubbing Washington state 48-19.

Stadium turf last Saturday.
And just as (Jarrett was distin
guishing himself. John Steinberg,
the loose-jointed wingman from.
Short Hills. New Jersey, had his
greatest day. Steinberg, with his
tfreat hands, was snagging passes
all over the lot. And when he got
them, he knew what to do with
the ball, gobbling np ten yards
with each giant sride.
But at the beginning, we said that
Stanford came of age. And it did.
Not only did the Indians roll up the
highest point total since beating
USF, 55 to 7, in 1950. They also
showed their best blocking and
tackling of the season. The pass
protection, in particular, was almost
flawless.
Stanford came of age, because
for the first time this season, the
Indians fully established them
selves as favorites for the Rose
Bowl. Before, the experts had re
garded the Cards as just punk in
truders who had eked by UCLA by

I one point and lucked by Wash
ington. Now, the Indians had
grown muscles and were a her
culean threat.
The game, incidentally, was the
100 th football win in the PCC for a
Stanford team.
Many boys displayed brawny tal
ents last Saturday. The whole cen- :
ter of the line, Ted Tanner, Norm j
Manoogian, Phil Wilson, Matt Ar
mitage, and Win Wedge, were good.
A 1 Napoleon showed that he may be 1
Stanford's best breakaway threat, j
Rogers and newcomers Joe Moreau
and Dick Crepeau were impressive
in the backfield, and John Stewart
and Marv Tennefoss were impres- !
sive at ends.
Also, a pat on the back lor stand
bys Ron Cook and Ernie Dorn;
quarterback Don Kafka, who rolled
off a sweet bootleg scoring play; and
Len Doster, John Stanton, Dick
Gant, and Marsh Howe.
And so next week, it's down to
| the Coliseum to meet USC, of which
there is none more hated. One of

the most mammoth southern migra
tions in Farm history should take
place to see the game that could
decide the Rose Bowl.
The Indians will be favored. For
they came of age last Saturday.
