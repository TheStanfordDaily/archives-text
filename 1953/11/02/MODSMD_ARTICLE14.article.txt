# DRAFT TEST
## Applications Due Tonight 
### 
Deadline for submitting applica
tions for the Nov. 19 Selective
Service College Qualification Test is
midnight tonight, Selective Service
officials have announced.
Applications postmarked after
that time cannot be considered. Lo-
boards have a supply of test ap
plication blanks for draft - eligible
students.
Completed applications may be
mailed to Educational Testing Serv
ice, Princeton, New Jersey.
To be eligible to apply for the
college qualification test, a student
must:
1. Intend to request deferment as
a student.
2. Be satisfactorily pursuing a
full-time course of instruction.
3. Not have previously taken the
test.
Criterion for deferment as an un
dergraduate is based on either a
satisfactory score of 70 on the test
or specified rank in class. The stu
dent must be in the upper half of
the men in the freshman class, the
upper two-thirds in the sophomore
class, and the upper three-fourths
in the junior class for deferment.
Another test will be held April
22, 1954, but students whose aca
demic year ends in January are
urged by the Selective Service to
take the Nov. 19 test so they will
have a test score before the end of
their academic year.
