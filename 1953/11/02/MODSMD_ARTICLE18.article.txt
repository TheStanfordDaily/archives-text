UNCLE REMISS SPINS A YAKN (Shaggy
Dogs Beware!)
A Bedtime Story for that Light O'clock Lecture
Seems like once there lived a rabbit, see, and let's
not have this Br'er Rabbit stuff, either, because this
rabbit's name was Oliver Cromwell Hare, and with

;i name like that, to what could
lie aspire but to go to college.
Well sir, Mamma and Papa Hare
didn't take a shine to that, because
they figured that the boy should
get into baseball, like his brothers.
But Oliver Cromwell was all set to
go, and he aspired further to at
tend Wabash Tech.
But, alas, Oliver Cromwell
couldn't make a go of it ;it Wa
bash Tech because the English

courses were too tough, so he transferred to Stanford
University (a local prep for the University of Korea)
and fell right into his element. Or so he thought. "Man,
■this is great!" said Oliver Cromwell Hare to himself.
"I'll live it to the hilt! I'll be one of the boys (ridicu
lous, of course, since Oliver Cromwell Hare was a
rabbit, but he planned to pass himself off as a sopho
more)! I'll slide through school—l'll take journalism.
This is for me!"
And by gosh, Oliver Cromwell Hare made a fine
• tart, boys and girls. Yep, he registered just fine, even
baffling the tuition clerk by playing dumb and saying
nothing. He got into all the accepted classes and filled
out all his blue cards incorrectly, just like anyone. He
never worried about room and board, because he

lived in the Biology greenhouse and ate whatever
appealed to his eye. Yes, sir, Oliver Cromwell Hare
was all set.
But then he tried to mingle. At first he was accepted,
mainly by Creative Writing majors and other sopho
mores, but then! They found out about Oliver Crom
well Hare's shortcomings.
"C'mon, Ears, leave us take your car and go down
to the Spa for a glass of milk!" said someone one night.
"But I don't have a. car," .said Oliver Cromwell.
"No car? Ridiculous!"
"But I don't!"
One by one, the assembled few got up with
mumbled excuses and left. Presently Oliver Crom
well was alone.
Later: "Look, Ears, you're a good guy and we all
like your moderate habits and quiet good nature, but
don't you have any other clothes? That white suit
is too much! How about some faded blues? A polo
shirt? White bucks? Loud sox?"
"I don't have any," said Oliver Cromwell Hare.
"So much for you," said they.
And still later: "Say, Oliver Cromwell, which House
are you in?"
"I'm not in a House."
"Eating Club?"
"No."
"Well, so long then, Ears."
But don't shed tears, children, because ol' Oliver
Cromwell Hare was learning his lesson. He couldn't
make do at Stanford, but when he went back to being
a plain old rabbit, he was a success. After all, a rabbit
has his compensations. He doesn't have to attend labs.
