## On the WUS Drive 
### 
An Klcuiail ol (Complacency

To the Editor:
The autumn quarter relief drive was a disappoint
ment to many of those who strove to make it suc
cessful. During the drive, less than two thousand
dollars was raisedâ€”less than forty cents per capita was
donated by the members of the Stanford student body.
These results are indicative of much more than the
mere failure to raise a reputable amount of money.
Even a superficial analysis of this incident leads to
some unpleasant conclusions.
Our attention is drawn to the fact that there is an
element of complacency among us college students.
We are prone to disregard those events and institu
tions which do not affect us directly, and we are
unwilling to espouse a world-wide quest for freedom
and security as long as we ourselves possess these
assets.

With this altitude, we American students stand to
lose a great deal. We, who would invest more time and
money in a "conspicuously wasteful" array of parade
floats than we give to those millions of human beings
who are in need of books, shelter, and medical care,
certainly have not actively substantiated the lip-serv
ice which we have been paying to the war against
communism.
The circumstances demand action, action in the fu
ture which will assure us that a disgrace such as the
results of this drive never occurs again; for people in
want are looking to us for help, anil if we do not
awaken to the realization that "we are our brothers'
keepers," then these people may soon cease to look
upon us as brothers.

Tlianks In ! hose Who Helped

To the Editor:
I would like to take this opportunity to thank every
one who expended so much of his time and energy to
help make this fall's World University Service Drive
a success. Their enthusiasm and follow-through were
wonderful, as evidenced by the contributions of such
groups as Lathrop House, AKL, and Roth, who turned
in $2.39, $1.75, and $1.40, respectively, per capita. La-

gunita led the big dorms in spirit and in donations
a total of 95 cents per girl.
I would particularly like to thank all those who so
licited for WUS, both on and off campus; and, of course,
all those on the Fall Drive Committee, without whose
constant efforts we could never have gotten as far as
we did. 808 GABLE
