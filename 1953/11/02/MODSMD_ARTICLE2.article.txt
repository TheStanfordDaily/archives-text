PANMUNJOM, Monday, Nov. 2
(UP) —Deadlocked United Nations
and Communist diplomats opened
the second week of negotiations to
set up the Korean peace confcrcnee
today under a South Korean warn
ing that time is running out on
President Syngman Rhee's promise
to observe the armistice.
Allied sources said shortly before
today's meeting that Rhee was
standing firm in his decision to take
action to unite Korea—by force if
necessary—if the peace conference
has not made obvious progress to
ward that goal 90 days after its
scheduled Oct. 28 start.
The talks resumed at 11 a.m. (Ko
rean time) with no sign that cither
side was prepared to change its
stand on the question of inviting
neutral nations to participate in the
peace conference.
Qualified observers believed that
even under ideal negotiations the
peace conference could not get
started within four weeks.
