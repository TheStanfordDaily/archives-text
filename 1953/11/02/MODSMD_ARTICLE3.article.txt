# Lathrop Tops WUS Drive; More Coming

As the World University Service
Drive officially closed Friday, the
preliminary total reached $1,959.52.
Of this amount, about $200 will go
to pay overhead expenses of the
drive. That brings the total nearer
the total received in last fall's Com
munity Chest Drive, which was
$1,739.19.
The first $800 wiir be given to
the ASSU Foreign Scholarship Com
mittee to administer. Two per cent
of the total will constitute the Fall
Quarter Drive's portion of the drives
committee floating fund, which is
divided among three or four chari
ties that apply during the year. The
balance of the total will go directly
to WUS.

faculty, and ofT-campus return-mail
contributions haven't come in yet, as
well as contributions from fraterni

turned in to Gable at the AKL house,
or to Bette Dann at Lagunita Court
