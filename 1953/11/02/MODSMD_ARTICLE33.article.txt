three ol Cal's touchdowns. His three
punts averaged 44 yards, and he re
turned three kickoff's for 93 yards

second quarter. The young Cal
(la.sh starred on defense too.
The Stanford squad dominated
play throughout the game, even in
defeat. They gathered 20 (irst
downs, while the best the little
Hears could do was seven.
Tackle Dale Smith set the scene
for the Papooses' first score when
he recovered a fumble by Cal's Herb
Jackson on the Cal 23. Paul Camera
passed• to Hank Roldan down to the
eight, and then Tony Serra crashed
through the middle to the two,
where Cal's Knox and Jim Cherry
dropped him. Holdan then hit left
tackle on a cross buck to score.
Noes attempted conversion was
wide to the left, so the score re
mained (i-0.
After failing to gain at the line,
Cal kicked out to their 45, and
Stanford returned the ball to the
25. Brodie threw to Kaftery for
15. and then kept the ball himself
on a bootleg lo score. This time
Kaftery's conversion was wide to
the left. Score 12-0.
Knox carried ( his team in their
first touchdown chive with his pass
ing, after running the Stanford
kickofi' back to the Stanford 49.
Terry Prindiville was his principal
target, and made a nice catch in the
corner of the end zone for Cal's first
score. Jackson's conversion attempt

was blocked by Gene Manzer.
In the second half Prindiville's
fingertips fell just short of a long
Knox heave to the goal when Cal
took over after a Card drive bog
ged down, hut he and teammates
.Vlike While and Delton Morris
caught enough aerials ti» carry
them to the Stanford 12. Camera
and Chuck Savin held Bill Vallot
ton at left guard, but Morris
snagged a Knox toss in the end
zone. Trutncr's kick was wide to
the left, and the game was tied,
12-12.
Knox took advantage of a Card
fumble, and threw long to Mor
ris, who went all the way. The play
covered 30 yards. Trutner finally
kicked the game's only etxra point,
and the scoring was completed—l -
12.
Jim Noe was the most effective
runner in the Stanford backtield,
gaining (>2 yards in nine attempts
for a (».9-yards-per-carry avra,ge.
Camera also carried nine times,
many of them on a very effective
quarterback sneak, and gained I!)
yards for a 5.2 average.
Hank Roldan gained 4(5 yards in
11 attempts for 4.1 yards per try.
and Jim Serra toted the pigskin the
most- 12 plays gaining 159 yards and
compiling a 3.4 average. Serra ran
very well as a hard-crashing lull
back through the line.

Stanford, John Brodie hit seven
times in 12 tries for 75 yards, and
Camera completed two for three,
totaling 15 yards.

was blocked by Gene Manzer.
In the second half Prindiville's
fingertips fell just short of a long
