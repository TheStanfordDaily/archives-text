# Taylor, Kircher Sing Garrett's Praises
## 
### RUSS WILKS MIKE HUDSON 
There 'was backslapping and
handshaking all around, but no
raucous outbursts in the Stan
ford locker room Sautrday as it
is becoming evident that the
Indians are getting used to win
ning.
Their latest victory, the fourth in
a low, was taken in stride, and all
that the players could think about
was a trip to Los Angeles next week
end. A win there would promise to
•et off quite an after-game din.
Chuck Taylor, seated on a train
ing table surrounded by newspa
per men, could look around Stan
ford's line passing attack and pick
out weaknesses. "We didn't get
our running game going as well ;is
I wanted from what I saw, but I'll
know better when I take a look
al the pictures."
Taylor stated that "our blocking
in general is still weak and our tack
ling was weak in some spots today."
However, the Card mentor did see
some improvement when he added,
"We have improved with every
name in all phases."
Taylor then started in on indi
vidual performances, singly \ out
the airborne threesome, (Jarrett,
Morley, and Steinberg, and in ad
dition he was pleased with Don
Kafka, Jack (.chert. Tony Mosich.
and Dorsey Atkinson.
Finally the conversation got
around to Stanford's next game

when a reporter asked, "llow about
the Rose Bowl?"
To this Taylor came through with
a typical Taylor answer. "SC is
next week." However, he did give a
hint that he could visualize Stan
lord in the Bowl when he said, "SC
can be beaten. Michigan State can
be beaten. We could do it, but Gar
rett has to be sharp."
Taylor conjectured that SC's
loss (o Oregon would make the
Trojans "hotter than a firtrcracker
for us. Don't think we'll be let
down though. Our boys have been
looking toward this game all sea
son. We'll have to play our top
game. You know it. I know it.and
they know it. We'll work harder
this week than we've ever worked
and that means contact."
Then in a moment of remorse
Taylor sent out his condolences to
Al Kircher, Washington State coach.
"I know Kircher feels bad. I sure
feel sorry for him. I know what it
is to be beaten badly. Gee, they
play Texas Christian next week;
there's another tough one."
"I was surprised that we beat
them that bad. I thought this was
going to be a real tough game. I
would have liked to give my regu
lars a little more work, but at least
there aren't any injuries," Taylor
added.

"I see no reason why Stanford
won't go to the Rose Bowl. They
should beat either Cal or USC."
The man talking was Wash
ington State coach Al Kircher,
who seemed surprisingly calm
after Stanfords' aerial circus had
disintegrated the Cougar de
fense.
"As long as Garrett is in there,
Stanford can beat anyone. He was
the whole show as far as I'm con
cerned. No, change that—lie had
two great ends to throw to. They
are as fine a pass combination as
I have ever seen. They made a
couple of plays would have scored
against any team in the country."
"Our halfbacks looked bad, but
our line was equally at fault. We
couldn't get at their passers. The
Stanford-USC game will depend on
how well the Stanford line can hold
out that rough USC line. If Garrett
has time to pass, Stanford should
win."
Kircher said that he wasn't par
ticularly impressed with the Stan
ford running attack or tin- Stan
ford line. ' Hut oh, that Garrett!"'
He gained soma solace from the
fact that no one was hurt and from
the play of Doug Riggs. a reserve
end who anchored the side of the
line during the second hall.
"We have no excuses. We were
beaten by a better team. Garrett
looked like an All-American today."

"Our halfbacks looked bad, but
our line was equally at fault. We

Stanford-USC game will depend on
how well the Stanford line can hold
out that rough USC line. If Garrett
has time to pass, Stanford should
win."
Kircher said that he wasn't par
ticularly impressed with the Stan
ford running attack or tin- Stan
ford line. ' Hut oh, that Garrett!"'
He gained soma solace from the
fact that no one was hurt and from
the play of Doug Riggs. a reserve
end who anchored the side of the
line during the second hall.
"We have no excuses. We were
beaten by a better team. Garrett
looked like an All-American today."
There 'was backslapping and
handshaking all around, but no
raucous outbursts in the Stan
ford locker room Sautrday as it
is becoming evident that the
Indians are getting used to win
ning.
Their latest victory, the fourth in
a low, was taken in stride, and all
that the players could think about
was a trip to Los Angeles next week
end. A win there would promise to
•et off quite an after-game din.
Chuck Taylor, seated on a train
ing table surrounded by newspa
per men, could look around Stan
ford's line passing attack and pick
out weaknesses. "We didn't get
our running game going as well ;is
I wanted from what I saw, but I'll
know better when I take a look
al the pictures."
Taylor stated that "our blocking
in general is still weak and our tack
ling was weak in some spots today."
However, the Card mentor did see
some improvement when he added,
"We have improved with every
name in all phases."
Taylor then started in on indi
vidual performances, singly \ out
the airborne threesome, (Jarrett,
Morley, and Steinberg, and in ad
dition he was pleased with Don
Kafka, Jack (.chert. Tony Mosich.
and Dorsey Atkinson.
Finally the conversation got
around to Stanford's next game

when a reporter asked, "llow about
the Rose Bowl?"
To this Taylor came through with
a typical Taylor answer. "SC is
next week." However, he did give a
hint that he could visualize Stan
lord in the Bowl when he said, "SC
can be beaten. Michigan State can
be beaten. We could do it, but Gar
rett has to be sharp."
Taylor conjectured that SC's
loss (o Oregon would make the
Trojans "hotter than a firtrcracker
for us. Don't think we'll be let
down though. Our boys have been
looking toward this game all sea
son. We'll have to play our top
game. You know it. I know it.and
they know it. We'll work harder
this week than we've ever worked
and that means contact."
Then in a moment of remorse
Taylor sent out his condolences to
Al Kircher, Washington State coach.
"I know Kircher feels bad. I sure
feel sorry for him. I know what it
is to be beaten badly. Gee, they
play Texas Christian next week;
there's another tough one."
"I was surprised that we beat
them that bad. I thought this was
going to be a real tough game. I
would have liked to give my regu
lars a little more work, but at least
there aren't any injuries," Taylor
added.

"I see no reason why Stanford
won't go to the Rose Bowl. They
should beat either Cal or USC."
The man talking was Wash
ington State coach Al Kircher,
who seemed surprisingly calm
after Stanfords' aerial circus had
disintegrated the Cougar de
fense.
"As long as Garrett is in there,
Stanford can beat anyone. He was
the whole show as far as I'm con
cerned. No, change that—lie had
two great ends to throw to. They
are as fine a pass combination as
I have ever seen. They made a
couple of plays would have scored
against any team in the country."
"Our halfbacks looked bad, but
