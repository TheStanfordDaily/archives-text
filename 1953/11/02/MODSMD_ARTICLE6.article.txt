Profits from this year's Row Car
nival will probably amount to about
$560 when taxes and expenses have
been cleared, co - chairmen Nancy
Schmidt and Mary Sarah DcWitt
announced yesterday.
The «ames, food, and entertain- j
mcnt. booths set up by the nine
women's* Row houses Friday night
actually grossed $837.37.
Lathrop House's "Moulin Rouge," I
featuring can - can dancers and
French music in a cabaret setting,
made the largest profits for the
Row's scholarship funds—over $180.
Next most profitable attractions j
were the auction, which grossed
and Russell House's food j
l»ooth, whydi made $Hl.BO.
This year's carnival was more
sparsely attended than last year's,
which cleared about $7. r >o.


YAA—HOO!—The real live can-can line helped make Lathrop House's "Moulin Rouge" the
most profitable event at Friday night's Row Carnival. Ann Kleerup, Becky Gruver, and Mag
gie Chantry are proof of why the overflow audience got such a big kick out of the floorshow.
