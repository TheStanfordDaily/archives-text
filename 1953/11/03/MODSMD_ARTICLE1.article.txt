# Newsweek Reports on U.S. Students: Security, Conformity Keynote 1953
## 
### WIN GRIFFITH 
What are the college students of 1953 like as people?
What do they worry about and what do they want?
How do they differ from their predecessors?
Newsweek Magazine, on the stands this week, has attempted
to answer those questions after an "extensive study" of seven

essentially different student
bodies.
Reporters of the magazine
watched and heard students in the
following institutions:
UCLA (public, coeducational);
Northwestern (Methodist - related,
coeducational); Georgia Institute of
Technology (public, engineering,
men); Georgetown (Roman Catholic,
men); Howard (private, Negro, co
educational); Princeton (private,
men); Vassar (private, women).
The article which came out of the
study emphasizes an apparent drive
among the students of those colleges
for security and conformity.
A Vassar coed was quoted as
saying: "We're a cautious genera
tion. We aren't buying any ideas
we're not sure of."
A Princeton senior told report
ers: "The world doesn't owe me a
living—but it does owe me a job."
And a Northwestern student told
Newsweek: "You want to be popu
lar, so naturally you don't express
any screwy ideas. To be popular, you
have to conform."
Newsweek sees in these and other
comments a difference between the
student of today and the student of
recent decades.
"Shrewder, more mature than
their grandfathers, more cautious
than their fathers, they work
harder and arc more likely to
think things through. Socially,
economically, politically, emotion
ally, and philosophically, they
want to conform and to have se
curity."
The magazine implies that this
maturity and thoughtfulness is a
holdover from the years when the
great mass of World War II veterans
stepped into the college population.
The veterans, older and tougher than
the average freshman, brought a so
ber tone to the campus—and scoffed
at the stereotyped "antics" of the
pre-war student.
Newsweek cites the temper of the
times as another reason for a sober
perspective and a drive for security
by today's students.
"They grew up with wars and
rumors of wars," the magazine
says. "Their fathers and brothers
served in the second world war;
their brothers, friends, and sweet
hearts fought in the Korean con
flict. And for both boys and girls
on campuses now, the shadow of
the draft hangs darkly over their
future."
The editors note that today's stu
dents have revived some of the 'rah
rah spirit" of the goldfish swallow
ing age, but that "it's nothing like it
used to be."
Students who were interviewed
indicated that they arc still inter
ested in the more exuberant aspects
of college life—the fads, drinking,
and sex—but that they arc more re
strained in those activities.
"You can't drink and keep up your
studies," a Princeton junior re
marked.
The stress on study and the
toning down of collegc "fun" is
(lie result of the basic desire for
security, Newsweek indicates.
Ultimately, the magazine says,
students of today want "to be con
tented, to have a home and a fam
ily, and to make a success of their
chosen field." The collegc degree
is one of the big steps toward the
fulfillment of these wants.
"With so many veterans with col
lege educations," Newsweek reports,
"students know they must have
A.B.'s to ccxnpctc in the job market."
In quest of that degree and in the
search for security, the students of
the seven "representative" institu
tions have shown in Newswcek's
study that their attention is switch
ing from beer busts and politics to
books and religion.
