# Football Round-up
## 4 DAYS TILL USC Scout Issues Warning to Cards 
### PETE GROTHE Sports Editor, The Daily 
Coach George Lynn, the man who
scouted USC in its last three games,
mouthed a stern warning yesterday.
"If the Trojans had beaten Oregon,
they would have really been mean
in the Coliseum this Saturday," said
Lynn. "But now that they were up
set by the Ducks, they'll be posi
tively mutinous."
But the dapper backfield coach
with the toothpaste ad smile also
threw in a word of encouragement.
"USC can be passed against and
USC can be run against, and our
boys have a few scores to settle. The
team members have been pointing
for this game all year, and the task
of the coaching staff will be an un
usual one. We'll have to tone the
boys down this week, instead of pep
ping them up."
"Oregon's win over USC was a
legitimate one. The Oregon line
men handled the Southern Cal
forwards on even terms, and wc
can do the same thing."
Scout Lynn admitted that one of
Stanford's main worries will be pro
tecting for Garrett's passes from the
onslaught of USC's line. Sometimes
Troy rushes four men on a pass and
floats the ends. At other times they
send the ends in or shoot in a line
backer, usually guard George Tim
berlakc.
Stanford's pass protection has been
one of its strongest points this year,
but if anyone is to get through to
Garrett, it'll be Southern Cal's be
hemoth linemen.
Lynn reports that the Trojans

should be in fairly good health this
Saturday. Fullback Harold Han, who
didn't play against Oregon, because
of a sprained ankle, is expected to
be ready for the Cards. Second string
tailback A 1 Decker will be sidelined
with a twisted knee. But first line
tailback Aramis Dandoy, who was
knocked out in the Oregon affair,
will definitely start for Troy.
The scout reports show that
L'SC's tackles Ed Foucli and Mario
Da Re are big and aggressive, but
: can be handled, and that Ed Pucci
is probably the strongest lineman.
Timberlakc is also very dangerous
when he's backing the line, but is
less effective when he's in the line.
The Trojans' best ground-gainers
arc off-tackle plays and down-the
middle spinner plays with trap
blocking.

should be in fairly good health this
Saturday. Fullback Harold Han, who
didn't play against Oregon, because
of a sprained ankle, is expected to
be ready for the Cards. Second string
tailback A 1 Decker will be sidelined
with a twisted knee. But first line
tailback Aramis Dandoy, who was
knocked out in the Oregon affair,
will definitely start for Troy.
The scout reports show that
L'SC's tackles Ed Foucli and Mario
Da Re are big and aggressive, but
: can be handled, and that Ed Pucci
is probably the strongest lineman.
Timberlakc is also very dangerous
when he's backing the line, but is
less effective when he's in the line.
The Trojans' best ground-gainers
arc off-tackle plays and down-the
middle spinner plays with trap
blocking.
Coach George Lynn, the man who
scouted USC in its last three games,
mouthed a stern warning yesterday.
"If the Trojans had beaten Oregon,
they would have really been mean
in the Coliseum this Saturday," said
Lynn. "But now that they were up
set by the Ducks, they'll be posi
tively mutinous."
But the dapper backfield coach
with the toothpaste ad smile also
threw in a word of encouragement.
"USC can be passed against and
USC can be run against, and our
boys have a few scores to settle. The
team members have been pointing
for this game all year, and the task
of the coaching staff will be an un
usual one. We'll have to tone the
boys down this week, instead of pep
ping them up."
"Oregon's win over USC was a
legitimate one. The Oregon line
men handled the Southern Cal
forwards on even terms, and wc
can do the same thing."
Scout Lynn admitted that one of
Stanford's main worries will be pro
tecting for Garrett's passes from the
onslaught of USC's line. Sometimes
Troy rushes four men on a pass and
floats the ends. At other times they
send the ends in or shoot in a line
backer, usually guard George Tim
berlakc.
Stanford's pass protection has been
one of its strongest points this year,
but if anyone is to get through to
Garrett, it'll be Southern Cal's be
hemoth linemen.
