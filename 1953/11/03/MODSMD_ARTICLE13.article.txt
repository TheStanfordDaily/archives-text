# Indians Scrimmage
## 
### 
Last night the Indians ran through
one of their best and most spirited
scrimmages of the year. As a mat
ter of fact, Coach Chuck Taylor said,
"They looked good. There was some
strong blocking."
It was the first time this season
that Taylor had praised a week-day
scrimmage.
The 45-minutc scrimmage was
devoted exclusively to running.
Not a pass was thrown. Ron Cook
broke away for a 51-yard touch
down run and fullback Jarvis Wat
son rolled off a 55-yard tally. Full
back Marsh Howe also was run
ning very hard. Norm Manoogian
and Win Wedge particularly im

pressed in blocking.
Fullback Bill Wentworth still re
mained a question mark. But with
Howe, Watson, fast-developing Joe
Moreau, and Dick Monteith, the
latter just off injury shelf, around,
the Indians shouldn't be short of
fullbacks.
Tackle Barry Smith put pads on
last night, but didn't participate in
the rough stuff. The results of an
electroencephalograph test, deter
mining whether Smith can start
this week, will be known today.
Jerry Goldberg, center, and John
Stewart, end. had minor leg hurts,
but they participated in the scrim
mage. Bill Tarr, the Bellingham,
Washington chargcr, did take part
in the live tackling session because
of a back ailment, but he should be
ready for USC.
The spirit was the highest that it
has been since the UCLA contest,
and when the practice ended, some
of the players were still straining
at the bit for more action.
