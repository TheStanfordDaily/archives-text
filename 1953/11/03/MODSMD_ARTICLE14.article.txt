# Air Crash Fire Under Control
## 
### 
The forest fire touched of! by the
crash of an Australian luxury air
liner near Kings Mountain last
Thursday has finally been brought
under control.
Firemen completed cutting trails
around the fire area Sunday. How
ever, a seven-man crew from the
San Mateo County Forest Service
was patrolling the area yesterday to
prevent a further outbreak. Fire
men were hampered by the inacces
sibility of the area, according to Fire
Warden Ernest H. Werder.
Sixty acres of second-growth red
wood, manzanita, and brush were
destroyed, Werder said.
At one time, six separate fires, ig
nited when the plane crashed and
exploded, were burning. Several
other spot fires were started when
burning logs rolled down hillsides
into areas not on fire.
Meanwhile, government officials
continued their investigation into
causes of the crash.
Five American officials from the
Civil Aeronautics Board and the
Civil Aeronautics Administration
were joined in their investigation
yesterday by three Australians.
Location of a public inquiry into
the accident has not been decided
on. James S. Bcaslcy, chicf adviser
of the international district office of
the CA'A, said that it probably will
be held in the Bay Area, although it
may be conducted in Australia.
