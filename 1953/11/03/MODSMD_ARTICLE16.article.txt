UNITED NATIONS. N.Y.. Nov.
2 (UP) — The United Nations'
powerful steering committee
recommended today full U.N.
debate on Communist atrocities
in Korea despite Russia's angry
denial of the charges.
The vote was 12 to 2 (Russia and
Poland) and was certain to be rati
fied by the 60-nation General As
sembly, slated to take up the mat
ter tomorrow morning.
Soviet Delegate Andrei Y. Vi
shinsky urged the committee to
fhrow out the American indictment
because it was aimed to "fan the
embers of war, prevent a relaxation
of international tension, and frus
trate a peaceful settlement of the
Korean question."
American Delegate Henry Cabot
Lodge, Jr.. quickly denied that the
United States move in bringing
the charges to the U.N. would
complicate pcacc efforts in general
or the I'anmnnjom negotiations on
the Korean pcacc confcrcncc in
particular.
"We do not believe," Lodge said,
"that human affairs can be con
ducted on the basis of suppressing
the truth, or on the basis of ignor
ig evil, or that anything sound or
good or lasting can be built on the
basis of sweeping things under the
rug as though they hadn't happened.
"We believe that something is
owed to the memory of the tragic
victims of these atrocities and that

simply to allow their suffering to
pass into oblivion is not right. In
the larger sense, therefore, what we
arc doing is in the interests of peace
and in the interests of better human
relations in the future."
The American case is based on a
U.S. Army report issued last week
charging that thousands of Red
held prisoners in Korea were
"killed by heatings, deliberately
planned starvation, cold - blooded
murder, /mutilation, and torture."
It listed 6,113 "probable" Ameri
can victims and an overall total of
29,815 "probable" victims among the
civilian population of Korea and all
Allied armies taking part in the
campaign against Red aggression.
Vishinsky insisted the chargcs
were "nothing but an invention, a
fabrication, and a gross falsifica
tion." He said Lodge was "playing
into the hands of the most reaction
ary circles who were trying to frus
trate pcacc in Korea and the Far
East."


MURDERED BY REDS—The U.S. Army, in a documented report on Communist "torture and
murder" in the Korean War, charged the Reds committed atrocities against 29,815 persons,
including 6,113 Americans. Caption under this picture, released with the report, says "many"
oi the Taejon execution trenches were merely open ditches excavated by bulldozers.
