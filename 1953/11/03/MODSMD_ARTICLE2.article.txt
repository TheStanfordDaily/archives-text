# Students Give Their Opinions On Conformity
## 
### 
According to the Nov. 2 edi
tion of Newsweek, the following
statement describes one attitude
prevalent among American col
lege students of 1953:
"You want to be popular, so nat
urally you don't express any screwy
ideas. To be popular, you have to
conform."
In an effort to determine whether
or not the statement is an adequate
description of an attitude at Stan
ford, The Daily sampled student
opinion yesterday in front of the
Cellar, in residences, on Quad, and
in classes.
Tlie questions asked were:
1. Do you think the statement is
true?
2. Do you think most people think
it is true?
Some of the comments were as
follows:
Jerry Crow, sophomore: "That all
depends. If you are a big-shot, you
don't have to conform. And I think
that most people believe it is true.
We have fraternities, for example,
and it is believed that if you do not
belong to them you are out."
Bill Taylor, freshman: "No, I don't
think that it is true. The only way
some people gain popularity is by
expressing screwy ideas."
Heather Alexander, freshman:
"No, I think that if you do have an
idea that does not conform to those
of other kids, you can still be pop
ular as long as your ideas arc not
too radical, and you yourself arc
not a radical fanatic."
Jan Lockwood, sophomore: "Yes, I
think it's necessary to conform. When
a person goes into a group he is
very likely to agree with the decis
ion the group makes whether or not
he really thinks that way."
Ruth Brostoff, senior: "Within
smaller groups conformity is neces
sary and is complied with, whether
people realize why they're conform
ing or not."
Bill Raff, sophomore: "College
students conform because during
their childhood they were forccd
by their parents to conform, and
very few people ever break away
from the habit. Most kids arc too
lazy to do anything but what the
crowd wants, anyway."
Dot Bowman, junior: "Unless taken
to great extremes, nonconformity
does not mean unpopularity. You
don't have to do exactly what the
crowd is doing to be popular. Often
those who dare to be different are
tht most respected."
L>ave Egan, freshman: "You don't
have to stick up for anything you
don't want to. As long as you aren't
against any set principle like
the Honor Code, there is no pres
miit: to conform here."
Ali liamdani, graduate student:
"I think the statement does de
scribe most American students. In

social and political life there is
little difference of ideas. 'Let some
body else do it' seems to be the
attitude."
IVf arc i a Mayer, sophomore: "I
don't think so at Stanford. People
dress differently at parties, different
organizations show varied interests.
You have to conform in very basic
social and moral ideas, but other
than that you don't."

Jon Cosovich, freshman: "No I
don't think it's true. I usually feel
free to express any ideas I have. A
person's popularity is dependent on
what they are. If they don't express
themselves they'll never be popu
lar. Only insecure people are con
formists. Nobody likes a conformist."
Al Gulick, sophomore: "I agree
with the statement and I think it's
a popular belief. Most people are in
secure. They need popularity, so
they conform to the most popular
ideas."
Jeanie Bobis, senior: "It's some
what true, but not as much as it
was in high school with the cliques
and the gangs. But I don't think
(hat way myself. That's why I like
New York where nobody cares
what you do."
I>ick Theilan, junior: "Sure, we
want to be popular. And I guess we
have to conform and restrain some
of our screwy ideas. But .we are
doing this so we can be part of a
group. It's in this group that we
find security and popularity. Most
people forget that school is our home
for nine months of the year, and
that we expect security and popu
larity at home."
Nan Gordon, sophomore: "I think
it's one of the biggest crimes on the
face of the earth that so many peo
ple have lost their individuality. 1
do not think this statement to be
true, and I don't think they're gain
ing any popularity by conforming."
Elizabeth W'iley, senior: "If you're
conventionally unconventional, then
a screwy idea can add to your popu
larity. But a really unorthodox idea
is regarded with suspicion."
Laura Ketchum. sophomore: "That
depends on whom you want to be
popular with. Most people respect
your ideas, unless you're too obnox
ious about it, and if you will listen to
other people."
Lynn Mitchell, sophomore: "By
conforming to everything you lose
your personality. You have to be
unique in something."

and it is believed that if you do not
belong to them you are out."
Bill Taylor, freshman: "No, I don't
think that it is true. The only way
some people gain popularity is by
expressing screwy ideas."
Heather Alexander, freshman:
"No, I think that if you do have an
idea that does not conform to those
of other kids, you can still be pop
ular as long as your ideas arc not
too radical, and you yourself arc
not a radical fanatic."
Jan Lockwood, sophomore: "Yes, I
think it's necessary to conform. When
a person goes into a group he is
very likely to agree with the decis
ion the group makes whether or not
he really thinks that way."
Ruth Brostoff, senior: "Within
smaller groups conformity is neces
sary and is complied with, whether
people realize why they're conform
ing or not."
Bill Raff, sophomore: "College
students conform because during
their childhood they were forccd
by their parents to conform, and
very few people ever break away
from the habit. Most kids arc too
lazy to do anything but what the
crowd wants, anyway."
Dot Bowman, junior: "Unless taken
to great extremes, nonconformity
does not mean unpopularity. You
don't have to do exactly what the
crowd is doing to be popular. Often
those who dare to be different are
tht most respected."
L>ave Egan, freshman: "You don't
have to stick up for anything you
don't want to. As long as you aren't
against any set principle like
the Honor Code, there is no pres
miit: to conform here."
Ali liamdani, graduate student:
"I think the statement does de
scribe most American students. In

social and political life there is
little difference of ideas. 'Let some
body else do it' seems to be the
attitude."
IVf arc i a Mayer, sophomore: "I
don't think so at Stanford. People
dress differently at parties, different
organizations show varied interests.
You have to conform in very basic
social and moral ideas, but other
than that you don't."

Jon Cosovich, freshman: "No I
don't think it's true. I usually feel
free to express any ideas I have. A
person's popularity is dependent on
what they are. If they don't express
themselves they'll never be popu
lar. Only insecure people are con
formists. Nobody likes a conformist."
Al Gulick, sophomore: "I agree
with the statement and I think it's
a popular belief. Most people are in
secure. They need popularity, so
they conform to the most popular
ideas."
Jeanie Bobis, senior: "It's some
what true, but not as much as it
was in high school with the cliques
and the gangs. But I don't think
(hat way myself. That's why I like
New York where nobody cares
what you do."
I>ick Theilan, junior: "Sure, we
want to be popular. And I guess we
have to conform and restrain some
of our screwy ideas. But .we are
doing this so we can be part of a
group. It's in this group that we
find security and popularity. Most
people forget that school is our home
for nine months of the year, and
that we expect security and popu
larity at home."
Nan Gordon, sophomore: "I think
it's one of the biggest crimes on the
face of the earth that so many peo
ple have lost their individuality. 1
do not think this statement to be
true, and I don't think they're gain
ing any popularity by conforming."
Elizabeth W'iley, senior: "If you're
conventionally unconventional, then
a screwy idea can add to your popu
larity. But a really unorthodox idea
is regarded with suspicion."
Laura Ketchum. sophomore: "That
depends on whom you want to be
popular with. Most people respect
your ideas, unless you're too obnox
ious about it, and if you will listen to
other people."
Lynn Mitchell, sophomore: "By
conforming to everything you lose
your personality. You have to be
unique in something."
According to the Nov. 2 edi
tion of Newsweek, the following
statement describes one attitude
prevalent among American col
lege students of 1953:
"You want to be popular, so nat

ideas. To be popular, you have to
conform."

Some of the comments were as

their childhood they were forccd
by their parents to conform, and
very few people ever break away
from the habit. Most kids arc too
lazy to do anything but what the
crowd wants, anyway."
Dot Bowman, junior: "Unless taken
to great extremes, nonconformity
does not mean unpopularity. You
don't have to do exactly what the
crowd is doing to be popular. Often
those who dare to be different are
tht most respected."
L>ave Egan, freshman: "You don't
have to stick up for anything you
don't want to. As long as you aren't
against any set principle like
the Honor Code, there is no pres
miit: to conform here."
Ali liamdani, graduate student:
"I think the statement does de
scribe most American students. In

social and political life there is
little difference of ideas. 'Let some
body else do it' seems to be the
attitude."
IVf arc i a Mayer, sophomore: "I
don't think so at Stanford. People
dress differently at parties, different
organizations show varied interests.
You have to conform in very basic
social and moral ideas, but other
than that you don't."

Jon Cosovich, freshman: "No I
don't think it's true. I usually feel
free to express any ideas I have. A
person's popularity is dependent on
what they are. If they don't express
themselves they'll never be popu
lar. Only insecure people are con
formists. Nobody likes a conformist."
Al Gulick, sophomore: "I agree
with the statement and I think it's
a popular belief. Most people are in
secure. They need popularity, so
they conform to the most popular
ideas."
Jeanie Bobis, senior: "It's some
what true, but not as much as it
was in high school with the cliques
and the gangs. But I don't think
(hat way myself. That's why I like
New York where nobody cares
what you do."
I>ick Theilan, junior: "Sure, we
want to be popular. And I guess we
have to conform and restrain some
of our screwy ideas. But .we are
doing this so we can be part of a
group. It's in this group that we
find security and popularity. Most
people forget that school is our home
for nine months of the year, and
that we expect security and popu
larity at home."
Nan Gordon, sophomore: "I think
it's one of the biggest crimes on the
face of the earth that so many peo
ple have lost their individuality. 1
do not think this statement to be
true, and I don't think they're gain
ing any popularity by conforming."
Elizabeth W'iley, senior: "If you're
conventionally unconventional, then
a screwy idea can add to your popu
larity. But a really unorthodox idea
is regarded with suspicion."
Laura Ketchum. sophomore: "That
depends on whom you want to be
popular with. Most people respect
your ideas, unless you're too obnox
ious about it, and if you will listen to
other people."
Lynn Mitchell, sophomore: "By
conforming to everything you lose
your personality. You have to be
unique in something."
According to the Nov. 2 edi
tion of Newsweek, the following
statement describes one attitude
prevalent among American col
lege students of 1953:
"You want to be popular, so nat
urally you don't express any screwy
ideas. To be popular, you have to
conform."
In an effort to determine whether
or not the statement is an adequate
description of an attitude at Stan
ford, The Daily sampled student
opinion yesterday in front of the
Cellar, in residences, on Quad, and
in classes.
Tlie questions asked were:
1. Do you think the statement is
true?
2. Do you think most people think
it is true?
Some of the comments were as
follows:
Jerry Crow, sophomore: "That all
depends. If you are a big-shot, you
don't have to conform. And I think
that most people believe it is true.
We have fraternities, for example,
and it is believed that if you do not
belong to them you are out."
Bill Taylor, freshman: "No, I don't
think that it is true. The only way
some people gain popularity is by
expressing screwy ideas."
Heather Alexander, freshman:
"No, I think that if you do have an
idea that does not conform to those
of other kids, you can still be pop
ular as long as your ideas arc not
too radical, and you yourself arc
not a radical fanatic."
Jan Lockwood, sophomore: "Yes, I
think it's necessary to conform. When
a person goes into a group he is
very likely to agree with the decis
ion the group makes whether or not
he really thinks that way."
Ruth Brostoff, senior: "Within
smaller groups conformity is neces
sary and is complied with, whether
people realize why they're conform
ing or not."
