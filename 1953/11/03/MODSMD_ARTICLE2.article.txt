# Students Give Their Opinions On Conformity
## 
### 
According to the Nov. 2 edi
tion of Newsweek, the following
statement describes one attitude
prevalent among American col
lege students of 1953:
"You want to be popular, so nat
urally you don't express any screwy
ideas. To be popular, you have to
conform."
In an effort to determine whether
or not the statement is an adequate
description of an attitude at Stan
ford, The Daily sampled student
opinion yesterday in front of the
Cellar, in residences, on Quad, and

a person goes into a group he is
very likely to agree with the decis

he really thinks that way."
Ruth Brostoff, senior: "Within
smaller groups conformity is neces
sary and is complied with, whether
people realize why they're conform
ing or not."
Bill Raff, sophomore: "College
students conform because during
their childhood they were forccd
by their parents to conform, and
very few people ever break away
from the habit. Most kids arc too
lazy to do anything but what the
crowd wants, anyway."
Dot Bowman, junior: "Unless taken
to great extremes, nonconformity
does not mean unpopularity. You
don't have to do exactly what the
crowd is doing to be popular. Often
those who dare to be different are
