# College and Conformity
## 
### 
livery once in a while the college population
of this country is placed under the patronizing
nye of a national magazine.
In the past, that population has been vari
ously described as dull, esthetic, sober, wild,
mature, insecure, and childish.
This week college students have been an
alyzed again, this time by Newsweek Maga
zine. And once again we are irritated not only
by the contradictions and inadequacies of such
"extensive studies" but by the embarrassing
feeling that some of the generalizations about
students are true.
Some of Newsweek's generalizations indi
cate that the present college student is con
sumed by a drive for security and that he is
willing to compromise, conform, and evade
to achieve a happy and permanent position
in life.
Most students, including those questioned
at Stanford yesterday, deny that they are will
ing to conform to become popular or secure.
But most students also maintain that it is not
really a bad thing to conform, that individual
ism and conformity can go hand in hand along
the path to security.
But we think that there is not enough room
for individualism and conformity on the same
path. We think that in reality it will be a path
that excludes individualism.
And we wonder about the possibility that
such a path might be so narrow that life would
become nothing more than a dull and unin

spired process of bringing home the proverbial
bacon.
We wonder if this narrow path has already
been the responsible factor ior the disinterest
students show toward politics and interna
tional troubles.
We wonder if this narrow path to security ex
cludes a consideration of some of the less ob
jective but sometimes more important ideals
of life.
We wonder about these possibilities all
the more when we see indications of "Ivory
Tower" attitudes on campuses or hear stu
dents voice scepticism toward the efforts ol
"wide eyed idealists."
For we think that there is no better place
than the college or university for the expres
sion of new ideas and a consideration of world
affairs. And we think there is no better age
than youth to develop a practical idealism for
the world and life.
Our feelings are best summarized by a state
ment made by Dr. Nathan M. Pusey, president
of Harvard University, to an incoming freshman
class this year:
"The millennium will not seem quite so close
to you perhaps as to some generations of col
lege students. You are perhaps too wise, too
close to those recently burned, to give your
selves quickly to easy enthusiasms. And yet,
it will be a tragic lack, and a very unwise kind
of 'wisdom,' if your generation feels no com
pelling urge to make the world over after its
own heart's desire." â€”Win Griffith
