### PETE GROTHE 
pr(m;ressive education
Educators are constantly trying to find new ways
of making learning more palatable to students. In 20
years from now, progressive education may have de
veloped to the point where the classroom will re
semble a TV give-away show, just to give incentive

to the students. Here is how a
Stanford poly sci class in 1973
might be run:
Prof: Well, well, welcome to
c lass, students. It's so nice that
you could all show up for the
midterm today. Now, let me see,
who will be the first contestant?
How about you, Finley?
Finley: Okay.
Prof: You know the game. It's
called "Tuition or Nothing." If

you win, you get your tuition of $480 paid for a quar
ter. And, remember, students, the honor code says
no coaching from the audience. All right, Finley, who
was elected the vice-president of the United States
in 1952?
Finley: Gosh, that's tough.
Prof: NIX ON you if you miss this.
Finley: I dunno.
Prof: Oh, I'm so sorry, Finley, the answer is Rich
ard Nixon. But for being such a good sport, here is
a certificate for five free cups of coffee at the Cellar.
Finley: I prefer death. "

Prof: On to our next question. Mary, you answer
this, Ff you win, you get an expense-paid two
weeks vacation at the romantic, charming Deke
house, located on the shores of Lake Louise-blue
Lake Lagunita.
* Mary: I'm ready.
Prof: What United States president was Hoover
Tower named after?
Mary: I forget.
Prof: Oh. that's too bad, but for being so good a
sport, you get a consolation prize of an autographed
copy of "Burns."
Mary: Gee, thanks.
Prof: Time for the commercial. Tell me, stu
dents, do you feel logy, listless, out of sorts?
Hhhhhmmmmmm? If you do, what you need is
"Books," spelled "B-o-o-k-s." You can pick them
up at the bookstore.
A rally com girl I know says, "I'm lovely, I'm en
gaged, I use books."
And Mrs. G. L.. a lady out at the Village, writes,
"My husband used to toss and turn at night. Then,
one night, I used a book. Now, he just lays there."
And so, students, get a book. You'll like it.
Well, that's all for today. But come back tomorrow.
Was the Taft-Hartley Act successful? Did McCarthy
catch any Communists? Was Alger Hiss a bad man?
For the answers to these and other biting questions,
come to class tomorrow, same time, same place.
Class dismissed.
