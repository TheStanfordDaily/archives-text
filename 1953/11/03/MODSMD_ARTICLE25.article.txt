# Candles and Cold Water— Encina's 'Good Old Days'
## 
### JIM PALMER 
If you'think thafr Encina is a
fun house now, a look at the rec
ords of 50 years ago would re
veal that the old-timers had a
pretty crazy time of it too.
Those were the days when En- j
cina housed almost all the Stanford j
men. Encina, fashioned after a ho
tel in Austria that Leland Stanford
once saw, opened in 1891.
A letter written home in 1891 re
veals the crude facilities available j
at Encina: "We stand in line for our
mail and candles. There are no
electric lights yet. It's pretty hard
on the eyes, studying by candle
light. There is no hot water yet and j

the cold water in the tubs is not
very clean."
One letter written in "the good
old days" illustrates the condition
of the food: "Things don't come
hot and we have beans every
where, boiled and baked, and
three times a day. We have cold
beef and mutton and mutton and
j more mutton. Two kinds of pud
ding, alternating."
The students organized against
! the food and adopted a yell:
"Rub, Rub, Rub,
We Want Grub!"
The "good old days" were rough
| and riotous too.
Take, for instance, the time
back in 1905 when Encina hired
a watchman. The students staged
a grand-scale demonstration that
puts any present-day pranks to
shame.
They turned out the lights in the
j club room, overturned tables, and
1 made a big commotion to attract the
| attention of the watchman. When
he came to ;;ee what was happening,
everyone gathered on the third and
fourth floor landings and bombed
him with bottles and cuspidors filled
with water, and boards and boxes.
[ The bombardment lasted two hours.
During the candle-light days, ex-
President Benjamin Harrison was a
: guest at Encina, while at Stanford
| to give a series of lectures on con
! stitutional law. Mrs. Leland Stan

lord filled the Encina pantry with ■
liquor and cigars for the former j
chief executive's pleasure. A week
after he left, a couple of students I
broke into the pantry and made off
with the goodies and proceeded to
have a $150 celebration.
There wasn't anything that the
authorities could do, because to- j
bacco and liquor were contraband
in the first place. Nobody was ever
apprehended.
The 1930's brought a new pe
riod of pranks at Encina. One of !
the more famous ones was the j
disassembling of an old out-down
Model T Ford and the reassem
bling of it on the fourth floor cor
ridor. Students ran il back and
forth along the hall.
Then there "was the horse prank.
Eight freshman football players, in
cluding Alf Brandin (now business j
manager of the University), Monk
Moserip and "Bones" Hamilton — i
later become the famous "Vow
Boys," found time hanging heavy, j
and went for a ride in a convertible. '
Spotting some horses in a pas- [
ture, they haltered one and led it
back to Encina. They took it into
the first floor room of Bob Rey
nolds. another "Vow Boy," and sup
plied some hay.
Brandin* still recalls the incident:
"You could smell that horse way up
on the fourth floor as soon as you i
stepped into the corridor." Rey- '
nolds was forever branded with the
nickname "Horse," following the in
cident.
Another immortal, Bobby Gray
son. figured in a prank when he
was a freshman. In those days,
Men's Council worked directly
under the Dean of Men.
He failed to appear when sum- !
moned by the Council, sending J
word that he was busy and would .
be there in a few minutes. Twenty
minutes later there was a knock on i
the door and in walked Bobby |
Grayson—stark naked.
Yep, those were the good old days \
all right. Good, that is, if you sur- J
vived them.


HOME SWEET HOME—Enema Hall hasn't changed much outwardly since its first residents
moved in many years ago. Its mute walls, if they could speak, could tell fascinating tales of
student escapades including horses in the rooms and Model-T Fords in the halls.

| and riotous too.
Take, for instance, the time
back in 1905 when Encina hired
a watchman. The students staged
a grand-scale demonstration that
puts any present-day pranks to
shame.
They turned out the lights in the
j club room, overturned tables, and
1 made a big commotion to attract the
| attention of the watchman. When
he came to ;;ee what was happening,
everyone gathered on the third and
fourth floor landings and bombed
him with bottles and cuspidors filled
with water, and boards and boxes.
[ The bombardment lasted two hours.
During the candle-light days, ex-
President Benjamin Harrison was a
: guest at Encina, while at Stanford
| to give a series of lectures on con
! stitutional law. Mrs. Leland Stan

lord filled the Encina pantry with ■
liquor and cigars for the former j
chief executive's pleasure. A week
after he left, a couple of students I
broke into the pantry and made off
with the goodies and proceeded to
have a $150 celebration.
There wasn't anything that the
authorities could do, because to- j
bacco and liquor were contraband
in the first place. Nobody was ever
apprehended.
The 1930's brought a new pe
riod of pranks at Encina. One of !
the more famous ones was the j
disassembling of an old out-down
Model T Ford and the reassem
bling of it on the fourth floor cor
ridor. Students ran il back and
forth along the hall.
Then there "was the horse prank.
Eight freshman football players, in
cluding Alf Brandin (now business j
manager of the University), Monk
Moserip and "Bones" Hamilton — i
later become the famous "Vow
Boys," found time hanging heavy, j
and went for a ride in a convertible. '
Spotting some horses in a pas- [
ture, they haltered one and led it
back to Encina. They took it into
the first floor room of Bob Rey
nolds. another "Vow Boy," and sup
plied some hay.
Brandin* still recalls the incident:
"You could smell that horse way up
on the fourth floor as soon as you i
stepped into the corridor." Rey- '
nolds was forever branded with the
nickname "Horse," following the in
cident.
Another immortal, Bobby Gray
son. figured in a prank when he
was a freshman. In those days,
Men's Council worked directly
under the Dean of Men.
He failed to appear when sum- !
moned by the Council, sending J
word that he was busy and would .
be there in a few minutes. Twenty
minutes later there was a knock on i
the door and in walked Bobby |
Grayson—stark naked.
Yep, those were the good old days \
all right. Good, that is, if you sur- J
vived them.


HOME SWEET HOME—Enema Hall hasn't changed much outwardly since its first residents
moved in many years ago. Its mute walls, if they could speak, could tell fascinating tales of
student escapades including horses in the rooms and Model-T Fords in the halls.
If you'think thafr Encina is a
fun house now, a look at the rec
ords of 50 years ago would re
veal that the old-timers had a
pretty crazy time of it too.
Those were the days when En- j
cina housed almost all the Stanford j
men. Encina, fashioned after a ho
tel in Austria that Leland Stanford
once saw, opened in 1891.
A letter written home in 1891 re
veals the crude facilities available j
at Encina: "We stand in line for our
mail and candles. There are no
electric lights yet. It's pretty hard
on the eyes, studying by candle
light. There is no hot water yet and j

the cold water in the tubs is not
very clean."
One letter written in "the good
old days" illustrates the condition
of the food: "Things don't come
hot and we have beans every
where, boiled and baked, and
three times a day. We have cold
beef and mutton and mutton and
j more mutton. Two kinds of pud
ding, alternating."

! the food and adopted a yell:

riod of pranks at Encina. One of !
the more famous ones was the j
disassembling of an old out-down
Model T Ford and the reassem
bling of it on the fourth floor cor
ridor. Students ran il back and
forth along the hall.
Then there "was the horse prank.
Eight freshman football players, in
cluding Alf Brandin (now business j
manager of the University), Monk
Moserip and "Bones" Hamilton — i
later become the famous "Vow
Boys," found time hanging heavy, j
and went for a ride in a convertible. '
Spotting some horses in a pas- [
ture, they haltered one and led it
back to Encina. They took it into
the first floor room of Bob Rey
nolds. another "Vow Boy," and sup
plied some hay.
Brandin* still recalls the incident:
"You could smell that horse way up
on the fourth floor as soon as you i
stepped into the corridor." Rey- '
nolds was forever branded with the
nickname "Horse," following the in
cident.
Another immortal, Bobby Gray
son. figured in a prank when he
was a freshman. In those days,
Men's Council worked directly
under the Dean of Men.
He failed to appear when sum- !
moned by the Council, sending J
word that he was busy and would .
be there in a few minutes. Twenty
minutes later there was a knock on i
the door and in walked Bobby |
Grayson—stark naked.
Yep, those were the good old days \
all right. Good, that is, if you sur- J
vived them.


HOME SWEET HOME—Enema Hall hasn't changed much outwardly since its first residents
moved in many years ago. Its mute walls, if they could speak, could tell fascinating tales of
student escapades including horses in the rooms and Model-T Fords in the halls.
