# ATOM STORAGE IN SPAIN PLANNED BY U.S.

### 
MADRID, Nov. 2 (UP)â€”U.S. Air
Force Secretary Harold E Talbott
said today the United States plans to
store atomic weapons in Spain, less
than two hours' jet Hying time from
the nearest Soviet satellite.
He made it plain that when the
United States signed its military
economic agreement with Spain last
month it took a giant step toward
acquiring atom bases only half as

far from Western Europe as the
present U.S. bases in North Africa.
Asked whether forthcoming con
duction of U.S. bases here would
cancel plans for construction of two
additional strategic air bases in Mo
rocco, Talbott said Spain and Mo
rocco were two different problems
"and what we do in Spain has
nothing to do with Morocco or vice
versa."
