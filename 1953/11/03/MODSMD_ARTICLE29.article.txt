# Taylor—Trojans Weaker, Can Be Run, Passed On

### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 2 (UP) —Coach Chuck Taylor of Stanford, sporting the Pacific Coast
Conference's only perfect loop record, opined today that the Southern California Trojans "can
be run against and they can be passed against."
However, Taylor amended the statement:
"Of course. I don't know if we have the club to do it."
Anyway, the optimistic one-time boy wonder of the coaching ranks appeared fully confident
that his Indians could chalk up their sixth consecutive PCC win against USC on Saturday, using

only the skimpy running drive
and the powerful passing at
tack.
l 'Tlu? loss to Oregon has taken
some of the invincibility myth off ;
the Trojans," said Taylor. "It is my
personal opinion that USC is not as
strong as last year. It does not have
as good a defense and its offense is [
not much better.
Taylor, preparing for the game
that Indian followers believe will
.settle the PCC race, said he would
have no difficulty getting his boys
"up" for this cotnest.
"In fact, I'm just hoping they
don't get too high," he said. "They
remember the 54-7 shellacking USC
gave us last year."
The coach let a few secrets out of
the bag on his passing attack—
something the USC coaches prob
ably already know, but it was news 1
to the sports writers—and probably
to fans.
"We figure every pass that Bob
Garrett throws will be on its way
in :{.2 seconds or less," said Taylor.
"And we figure that our defense
will keep the offensive linemen
away from (Barrett for at least five
seconds. Of course, the defense
doesn't always do that good a job.
But only twice has the opposition
gotten to him this year—and that
was against UCLA."
Coach Lynn Waldorf of Califor
nia, beaten by both USC and UCLA,
said he rated the Bruins as "slight
ly" the better team.
"UCLA has a better all-around
club than the Trojans. The Bruins
possibly have as good a West Coast
team as we've played in seven
vear.s," said Waldorf.
