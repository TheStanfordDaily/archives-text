LOS ANGELES, Nov. 2 (UP)—
Coach Jess Hill did not give his
Southern California Trojans much
rest today, sending the squad
through a brisk scrimmage and a
lengthy drill on pass defense in
preparation for Stanford.
Hill refused to credit anything ex- i
cept better football for Oregon's
upset 13 to 7 victory over his team
last Saturday.
"We met a good, inspired team,"
he told Southern California football
writers. "Oregon played the win
ning kind of football. We played •
good football but not that good.
"You can't take it away from

Oregon that it played hard, aggres
sive ball and we didn't come up to
tnem."
Turning to this Saturday's game
with Stanford, Hill said that he
expected his team would "have its
hands full. I just hope Stanford
has its hands full, too."
"End Coach Bill Fisk, who
scouted Stanford, tells me that
Bob Garrett is the finest college
passer he's ever seen," Hill com
mented.
Backs Aramis Dandoy, George
• »Bozanic, and Harold Han missed to
day's drills, but all three will be
back working out tomorrow.
