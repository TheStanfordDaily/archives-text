"There's a real football powerhouse clown at Westwood this year, and San
Francisco sportswriters to the contrary, the Big Game won't be played to
determine the PCC Rose Bowl representative this year." Irwin Johnson in
The Stanford Daily, Oct. 15.
"The Trojans are the Coast's toughest and best team ... if Cal has
bounced back, Larson and Co. will have a swell chance to . . . wallop the
Bruins . . Dink Templeton in the Palo Alto Times. Oct. 30.
Well, there are two gems from local sports columns of (he last several
weeks. It makes us stop and wonder why the hell anyone even tries to
write a column. You sit down and figure out a logical, coherent explanation
of this business of football, and it turns out to he 100 per cent wrong.
Pasadena on New Year's Day
After Saturday's grid action it looks like (1) the Big Game will have a
direct bearing on the Rose Bowl picture, and (2) USC is definitely not the
Coast's toughest and best team.
Stanford will go into the Coliseum clearly favored to whip the Trojans.
Oregon and Washington, the only mutual opponents so far this year, both
<li<l much better against SC than the Indians.
Of course, the home field is an advantage, but we've no complaint with
the play of Stanford against USC the last two times the two teams met in
the Coliseum. In both 1949 and 1951 the Cards upset favored SC teams,
playing what many considered their best games tn the big Figueroa Street
landmark.
After the Husky victory there was a slight odor of roses, but the trounc
ing of Washington State, coupled with SC's loss, has intensified the scent,
and the time has come to make plans for a glorious week in Southern
California during the holiday season.
Possible Replay?
A brief look at the Big Ten situation reveals an alarming possibility. Illinois
is leading the league with a 3-0 conference record. That's right, we already
played Illinois. Ever since the Big Ten and the PCC joined together to
pick the Rose Bowl contenders we've been waiting for this situation.
It's long been our contention that a replay of any game between two top
teams after an interval of more than three weeks would result in a very
different outcome. It could happen here.

Coast's toughest and best team.
Stanford will go into the Coliseum clearly favored to whip the Trojans.
Oregon and Washington, the only mutual opponents so far this year, both
<li<l much better against SC than the Indians.
Of course, the home field is an advantage, but we've no complaint with
the play of Stanford against USC the last two times the two teams met in
the Coliseum. In both 1949 and 1951 the Cards upset favored SC teams,
playing what many considered their best games tn the big Figueroa Street
landmark.
After the Husky victory there was a slight odor of roses, but the trounc
ing of Washington State, coupled with SC's loss, has intensified the scent,
and the time has come to make plans for a glorious week in Southern
California during the holiday season.
Possible Replay?
A brief look at the Big Ten situation reveals an alarming possibility. Illinois
is leading the league with a 3-0 conference record. That's right, we already
played Illinois. Ever since the Big Ten and the PCC joined together to
pick the Rose Bowl contenders we've been waiting for this situation.
It's long been our contention that a replay of any game between two top
teams after an interval of more than three weeks would result in a very
different outcome. It could happen here.
