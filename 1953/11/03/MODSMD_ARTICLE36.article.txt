BACK TO THE ATTACK—End Bill Scheidecker grabs the kickoff after Washington State's
third touchdown in the fourth quarter Saturday and returns the ball 10 yards to the Card 37-
yard line. Jerry Gustafson escorts Scheidecker upfield while John Ludeke helps clear the
way. Onrushing Cougars are Mel Thompson (64), who kicked off, and Duke Washington (22).
