## BEARING DOWN 
### 
The Stanford Athletic Department
would probably be the first to ad
mit that this year's home football
schedule is no great shakes, espe
cially with two of the games bein«
pitted before school had officially
opened. However, next season a
real treat is in store for Farm foot
ball fans as they will have the
chance to view two of the nation's
top intersectional contests. Per
forming in Stanford Stadium in 1954
will be Illinois, with its sensational
backfield duo of J. C. Caroline and
Mickey Bates, and Navy, one of the
ranking powers in the East this
year. Bay Areans will also be able
to see the always potent Oklahoma
Sooners next year, a.s they are
scheduled to pay a visit to Califor
nia at Berkeley.

Here it is supposedly the middle
of the football season, when all of
a sudden the first basketball pub
lication of the season reaches us.
It is "Basketball 1954," published
by Dell. For those who are inter
ested in the hoop game at this
time of year, "Basketball 1954"
rates Stanford to finish third in
the FCC Southern Division this
winter, with California first,
something we can't see from this
corner. It also rates the Indians'
Ron Tomsic on its All-Coast team
and lists the following Card bas
kethallers besides Tomsic among
the 50 best players on the Pacific
Coast: Don DeLong, Russ Lawler,
and Oleg Suxdaleff. I don't know
where Dell got its information,
but Lawler shows up on the list
as '"Dick Lawler."' Incidentally,
California is rated as the top
quintet on the Coast and 10th in
the nation.

It didn't get into The Daily be
cause of space limitations, but In
dian grid coach Chuck Taylor was
named United Press of the
Week" last week following the
Cards' win over UCLA. Belated
congratulations, Chuck.

Stanford will again be the
training site for the West team
for the East-West Shrine foot
ball game in San Francisco on
Jan. 3, 1954. Chuck Taylor is sup

posed to be the head coach of the
West squad, but a little ganv in
the Rose Bowl might interfere in
his plans. Personally we hope it
does.

Former Stanford football star Bob
Meyers, who played on the 1951
Rose Bowl team, is now one ol the
top players for the Quantico Marine
eleven. A few weeks ago Bob, who
also played with the San Francisco
49ers before going into the service,
booted a 22-yard field goal as the
Marines whipped Holy Cross 17 to 0.
A couple of other ex-Farm gridders
are playing service ball this fall.

Here it is supposedly the middle
of the football season, when all of
a sudden the first basketball pub
lication of the season reaches us.
It is "Basketball 1954," published
by Dell. For those who are inter
ested in the hoop game at this
time of year, "Basketball 1954"
rates Stanford to finish third in
the FCC Southern Division this
winter, with California first,
something we can't see from this
corner. It also rates the Indians'
Ron Tomsic on its All-Coast team
and lists the following Card bas
kethallers besides Tomsic among
the 50 best players on the Pacific
Coast: Don DeLong, Russ Lawler,
and Oleg Suxdaleff. I don't know
where Dell got its information,
but Lawler shows up on the list
as '"Dick Lawler."' Incidentally,
California is rated as the top
quintet on the Coast and 10th in
the nation.

Stanford will again be the

Jan. 3, 1954. Chuck Taylor is sup

posed to be the head coach of the

his plans. Personally we hope it
does.

Bullets recently. . . . Another ex-

The Stanford Athletic Department
would probably be the first to ad

schedule is no great shakes, espe

pitted before school had officially
opened. However, next season a
real treat is in store for Farm foot
ball fans as they will have the
chance to view two of the nation's
top intersectional contests. Per
forming in Stanford Stadium in 1954
will be Illinois, with its sensational
backfield duo of J. C. Caroline and
