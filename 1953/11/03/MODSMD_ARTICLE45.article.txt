# Behind the Scenes at Gaieties
## 
### JERRY SIMPSON 
The actors aren't the only
people working on Gaieties.
Backstage, in the basement, and
in the wings, various crews are
working on the necessary
props, costumes, and technical
details. Crew heads have been
chosen and work is progressing
on this year's production of Big
Game Gaieties.
This year's production calls for a
number of intricate set designs and
costumes. One of the outstanding
features of this show is to be the
varied number of unusual special
effects. The special effects commit
tee. has been asked to supply among
other things a smouldering haystack

and running water on the stage.
These are typical of the problems
faced by the crew.
The costume committee, like the
special effects crew, is faced with a
number of bizarre situations. Un
usual materials are used widely in
the production. Color, originality,
and unusualness of design are the
aims of the costume committee.
Lighting techniques will bfc used in
connection with special costuming
materials to produce unusual color
combinations.
As in all productions akin to
variety shows, each division of the
technical crew is asked to pro
vide a large and varied number of
costumes, lighting effects, sounds,
and properties. The large number
of people working oil the crews
indicates that this year's (iaieties
should not suffer from a lack of
fresh ideas of unusualness in de
sign.
