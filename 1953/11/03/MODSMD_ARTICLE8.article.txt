# Reds Make Fourth Try For POW's
## 
### 
PANMUNJOM, Tuesday, Nov.
2 (UP) â€” Kicking, screaming
North Korean prisoners were
dragged into interview tents to
face Communist "come home"
persuaders today in the fourth
Red attempt to win back Allied
captives.
A Communist effort to "soften up"
the Koreans with a 50 - minute
propaganda broadcast from both
male and female political officers
before the interviews failed when
singing, yelling prisoners drowned
out their words.
The broadcast originally was
scheduled to last only 10 minutes,
but on-the-spot officials of the
Neutral Nations Repatriation
Commission gave the Reds per
mission to stretch out their ap
peals.
In three previous sessions with
Chinese and North Korean prison
ers the Reds suffered stinging
propaganda set - backs when more
than 96 per cent of the total vio
lently rejected Communism.
The prisoners, who only two
weeks ago threatened a mass es
cape, walked peaceably along a
300-yard path lined by guards
from the holding compounds to
the explaining tents. Most of
them began violent struggles at
the tent entrances.
The Communists had forced post
ponement of yesterday's explaining
sessions by demands that they be
allowed to broadacst to prisoners in
the compounds all day during indi
vidual interviews.
Up to today they have won back
20 out of 921 Chinese in two sessions
and 21 out of 459 North Koreans in
Saturday's session.
But officials freely predicted more
of the trouble that has beset the re
patriation program sincc the start of
the explanations provided by the
armistice.
