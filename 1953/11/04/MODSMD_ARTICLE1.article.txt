# Over Emphasis on Political Problems Cited as British Colonial Weakness
## 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
"The main problem that Britain faces in its colonial policy is
the unfortunate overconcentration on political development and
the resulting underconcentration on social and economic develop
ment."
Archibald Campbell, colonial attache of the British embassy in

Washington, brought out this point
strongly in his informal talk yester
day afternoon in the Women's Club
house.
The talk, aimed mostly at stu
dents from Brilain and the British
Commonwealth, concentrated on
the British ideal of "self-govern
ment" and how it can best be
achieved.
"Political progress should have
firm foundations of social and eco
nomic development on which it can
rest. That is why colonialism has a
much better chance of succeeding
in a relatively rich country like Ni
geria."
Campbell emphasized that Britain
dislikes to throw out upon the world
a territory that cannot support itself
and does not have an adequate self
government .
Expressing hope that the colo

nies would remain loyal to Brit
ain, Campbell listed several strong
ties. |
"In the first place," he said, the
rule of law binds us together. All
lawyers in any of the colonies must
pass a bar examination in England,
and the principles that they learn
there carry over in their future
dealings."
Loyalty to the crown is another
strong factor, Campbell affirmed.
"Britain can give many advan
tages to her colonies," he affirmed.
"Both economical and, maybe even
more important, the advantage of
world prestige, which is of prime
importance in this day and age."
Carl Brand, professor of history,
introduced Campbell to the audi
ence of about 20 people.
