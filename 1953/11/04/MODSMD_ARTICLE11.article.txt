# Cosmopolitan Club Is Host To Internationally Minded
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
The crowds seen entering
Bowman Alumni House every
Friday afternoon between 4 and
6 are headed for the meeting of
the Cosmopolitan Club or, as
it is more commonly called, the
Cosmo Club.
The Cosmo Club functions as the
social organization of the Interna
tional or "I" Club, which is com
posed of GOO students—3oo of whom
arc from foreign countries. The"I"
Club serves as a social, intellectual,
and cultural liaison among its many
members.
The president of the Interna
tiona! Club and the Cosmo Club is
| Dlavvar Barakat, a senior chem
istry major from Egypt. The pur
pose of the Cosmo Club is purely
social—to provide an opportunity
for the foreign and American
Stanfordites to get together, make
friends, and talk.
The topics of conversation range
anywhere from the probability of a
third World War to tennis, from
universities in different countries to
dates.
Three years ago Ronald Hayes, an
American student, conceived the
idea of such an international get-to
gcther here on the Stanford cam
pus.
The club, which was organized
by the foreign students, held its
first meetings at his home. Since
then, either on campus or in pri
vate homes, the foreign students
at these meetings have been play*
I ing host to interested Americans.

It is a very informal gathering;
students drop in at any time be
tween 4 and 6 p.m. to talk and
have their refreshments.
The Cosmo Club is mutually
profitable to all its members. A
foreign student can, by meeting and
talking with American students,

| gain, a better picture of the Ameri
j can way of life.
The Cosmo Club will welcome any
students who are interested in sit
sitting and talking over a cup of
j coffee and getting to know in a
purely social atmosphere these stu
j dents from all over the world.
