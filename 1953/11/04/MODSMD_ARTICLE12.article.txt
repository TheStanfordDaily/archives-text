# TUESDAY SERIES
## Joyce Cary Discusses The Novel 
### SUE WHEAT 
Joyce Cary, modern British
novelist said to "have less
trouble with his ego than any
other living author," bore out
his reputation last night in Me
morial Auditorium as he quip
ped his way through one of the
most interesting Tuesday Series
of the year.
In explaining the birth of a novel,
Cary said that he first writes the
scene in which the meaning of the
story is most concentrated. "Then,"
he concluded, "if the meaning
comes through in that scene, the
book is possible."
Cary started writing at an early
age—seven, to be exact, when he
used to contribute to a family mag
azine which circulated among his
relatives. For a while he studied art
in Edinburgh and Paris; then his
tory and law at Trinity College, Ox
ford. In 1912 he enlisted with Mon
tenegrin troops in the Balkans and
followed this with government serv
ice in Africa.
"Then," he said, "I started to
write. I had lots of characters, but
just couldn't finish a book. What I
needed, and didn't have, was an idea
of the meaning of life.
"You cannot write without an
idea of life," the author of Sara
Monday and Gully Jimson ex
plained. "Life is chaotic nonsense—
unless we make it have meaning for
us."
"We see profound life all around
us," Cary said. "Fundamental situ
ations and passions of life are the
stuff of great art."
"What did Shakespeare know of
great queens or dictators from his
life in Stratford? Yet his flash into
Pompcy's mind is terrific. He
(Shakespeare) met his dictators,"
Cary said, "most probably in the
village pub."
Cary said that characters "com
posed in their backgrounds, are in
a sence more realistic than actual
people." (He cited as an example
Sherlock Holmes, of pure fiction,
whose "relics" were recently on ex
hibit in London.) Because Holmes
is built in with a static background
and society, he is, in many people's
minds, "more realistic than quite
important historic personages."
Summarizing, Cary suggested that
the author's first need is an appre
ciation of the permanent elements
of life, such as "inequality . . . the
price of a world condemned to be
I free."

(Shakespeare) met his dictators,"
Cary said, "most probably in the
village pub."
Cary said that characters "com
posed in their backgrounds, are in
a sence more realistic than actual
people." (He cited as an example
Sherlock Holmes, of pure fiction,
whose "relics" were recently on ex
hibit in London.) Because Holmes
is built in with a static background
and society, he is, in many people's
minds, "more realistic than quite
important historic personages."
Summarizing, Cary suggested that
the author's first need is an appre
ciation of the permanent elements
of life, such as "inequality . . . the
price of a world condemned to be
I free."
Joyce Cary, modern British
novelist said to "have less
trouble with his ego than any
other living author," bore out
his reputation last night in Me
morial Auditorium as he quip
ped his way through one of the
most interesting Tuesday Series
of the year.
In explaining the birth of a novel,
Cary said that he first writes the
scene in which the meaning of the
story is most concentrated. "Then,"
he concluded, "if the meaning
comes through in that scene, the
book is possible."
Cary started writing at an early
age—seven, to be exact, when he
used to contribute to a family mag
azine which circulated among his
relatives. For a while he studied art
in Edinburgh and Paris; then his
tory and law at Trinity College, Ox
ford. In 1912 he enlisted with Mon
tenegrin troops in the Balkans and
followed this with government serv
ice in Africa.
"Then," he said, "I started to
write. I had lots of characters, but
just couldn't finish a book. What I
needed, and didn't have, was an idea
of the meaning of life.
"You cannot write without an
idea of life," the author of Sara
Monday and Gully Jimson ex
plained. "Life is chaotic nonsense—
unless we make it have meaning for
us."
"We see profound life all around
us," Cary said. "Fundamental situ
ations and passions of life are the
stuff of great art."
"What did Shakespeare know of
great queens or dictators from his
life in Stratford? Yet his flash into
Pompcy's mind is terrific. He
(Shakespeare) met his dictators,"
Cary said, "most probably in the
village pub."
