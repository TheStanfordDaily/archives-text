# 'Facts' and Finances

### 
Sometimes the presentation of facts, no mat
ter how fair and detailed, gives an inadeguate
picture of a situation or trend.
The picture drawn from the facts of Stan
ford's financial situation is one of those times.
Superficially, it can be a pessimistic picture
drawn in somber tones of grey and black. The
facts are:
Stanford is in the red.
Stanford is operating under a deficit budget.
Stanford's tuition has been increased.
But the "facts" are incomplete. By them
selves, they do not indicate the true picture of
Stanford's financial picture now and its pros
pects for the future.
They do not indicate the confidence of Uni
versity leaders that Stanford's future is good.
They do not indicate the optimism of Univer
sity administrators that Stanford is adding to
its greatness by development and expansion.

They do not indicate the potential of the Uni
versity's long-range plans and the strength of
its leaders to carry out those plans.
And they do not indicate a basic philosophy
of Stanford University, a philosophy of confi
dence and foresight.
These are not "facts." They are rather atti
tudes and moods and ideals. But a great uni
versity is not built with bricks and mortar
alone—it is also built on a practical idealism
and a faith in the value and success of its ob
jectives.
Those objectives will be achieved. The ad«
ministration understands its present financial
situation and it understands the financial trends
for the future. Slowly but surely the financial
problems are being worked out, and slowly and
surely the picture of Stanford and its future is
crystallizing.
The picture is good. - Win Griffith
