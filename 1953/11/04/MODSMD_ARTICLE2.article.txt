# TUITION INCREASE
## 'Battle of the Budget' Hits Financial Problems 
### WIN GRIFFITH 
(Editor's note: This is the first Of two articles which will discuss the
University's financial situation and the reasons for the recent raise in
tuition. The second article will appear in tomorrow's Daily.)

Stanford University is currently waging what some administra
tion leaders call the "Battle of the Budget."
It is a battle which is being fought by dozens of University
planners and an army of alumni working for the various fund
raising programs.
It is a battle against a pattern of deficit financing. This pattern,

if carricd over too long a period,
would place the University in a
"precarious and dangerous" finan
cial position.
It is a battle which has been made
all the more vivid to students and
alumni by last week's announce
ment of a raise in the University's
tuition charge.
What is the nature of that battle
and what are the reasons for that
tuition increase?
The answers are difficult to as
certain and difficult to express.
The financing of such a complex
organization as a university is
long range and flexible and ex
planations of decisions and actions
of administrators are necessarily
general.
But some facts are evident. They
are:
1. The University is in the "red."
For the first time since the war,
yearly expenses have not been bal
anced by income. At the end of the
year 1952 to 1953, a financial state
ment. for that fiscal year listed a fig
ure of $303,000 of excess of expendi- |

•
tures over income.
2. The budget for the current year
(1953 to 1954) carricd the highest
deficit item in Stanford's history
when approved by the Board of
Trustees last x March. Since then,
that deficit has been lowered by ad
ditional bequests and gifts to the
University and by a higher enroll
ment than had been anticipated.
The president's office has indicated
that the figure will be brought down
even farther, but that Stanford will
still be in the red at the end of the
year.
Generally, (he "tight financial
situation" which Stanford faces
for the next few years has been a
result of a problem of skyrocket
ing costs thrown against a fixed
income. The income of the Uni
versity, drawn from tuition, en
dowment interest, and gifts, is ris
ing, hut it has not risen fast
enough to keGp pace with costs.
In comparison with other major
universities in the United States,
the percentage of alumni who con
tribute to the University is 22 per
cent; many of the Eastern schools
are well above the 50 per cent mark.
Stanford's endowment, oncc the
highest of any university in the
country, is now behind Harvard,
Yale, Columbia, Chicago, and the
University of California. The en
dowment here is now approximately
$45 million, compared to about $60
million for Cal, $140 million for
Yale, and over $200 million for Har
vard.
And Stanford's tuition rate, even
including the increase which will
he in effect next fall, ranks be
hind current tuition of most of the
other major private universities.
Some figures:
Stanford, $750; Princeton, $850;
Cornell, $820; Yale, $800; Columbia,
$796.
Gradually, the endowment of the
University is being increased. Last
year, Stanford received the highest
amount of money from gifts for any
year in its history. And with the
increase in tuition, University offi
cials hope that Stanford may climb
back into a more secure financial
position.

income. The income of the Uni
versity, drawn from tuition, en
dowment interest, and gifts, is ris
ing, hut it has not risen fast
enough to keGp pace with costs.
In comparison with other major
universities in the United States,
the percentage of alumni who con
tribute to the University is 22 per
cent; many of the Eastern schools
are well above the 50 per cent mark.
Stanford's endowment, oncc the
highest of any university in the
country, is now behind Harvard,
Yale, Columbia, Chicago, and the
University of California. The en
dowment here is now approximately
$45 million, compared to about $60
million for Cal, $140 million for
Yale, and over $200 million for Har
vard.
And Stanford's tuition rate, even
including the increase which will
he in effect next fall, ranks be
hind current tuition of most of the
other major private universities.
Some figures:
Stanford, $750; Princeton, $850;
Cornell, $820; Yale, $800; Columbia,
$796.
Gradually, the endowment of the
University is being increased. Last
year, Stanford received the highest
amount of money from gifts for any
year in its history. And with the
increase in tuition, University offi
cials hope that Stanford may climb
back into a more secure financial
position.

Stanford University is currently waging what some administra
tion leaders call the "Battle of the Budget."
It is a battle which is being fought by dozens of University
planners and an army of alumni working for the various fund
raising programs.
It is a battle against a pattern of deficit financing. This pattern,

if carricd over too long a period,
would place the University in a
"precarious and dangerous" finan
cial position.
It is a battle which has been made
all the more vivid to students and
alumni by last week's announce
ment of a raise in the University's
tuition charge.
What is the nature of that battle
and what are the reasons for that
tuition increase?
The answers are difficult to as
certain and difficult to express.
The financing of such a complex
organization as a university is
long range and flexible and ex
planations of decisions and actions
of administrators are necessarily
general.
But some facts are evident. They
are:
1. The University is in the "red."
For the first time since the war,
yearly expenses have not been bal
anced by income. At the end of the
year 1952 to 1953, a financial state
ment. for that fiscal year listed a fig
ure of $303,000 of excess of expendi- |

•
tures over income.
2. The budget for the current year
(1953 to 1954) carricd the highest
deficit item in Stanford's history
when approved by the Board of
Trustees last x March. Since then,
that deficit has been lowered by ad
ditional bequests and gifts to the
University and by a higher enroll
ment than had been anticipated.
The president's office has indicated
that the figure will be brought down
even farther, but that Stanford will
still be in the red at the end of the
year.
Generally, (he "tight financial
situation" which Stanford faces
for the next few years has been a
result of a problem of skyrocket
ing costs thrown against a fixed
income. The income of the Uni
versity, drawn from tuition, en
dowment interest, and gifts, is ris
ing, hut it has not risen fast
enough to keGp pace with costs.
