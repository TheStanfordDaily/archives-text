# It Depends on You—The Voter

Associated Student voters will march to the
polls today to vote in the ASSU primary elec
tions in which some sixty-six candidates are
vying for key campus posts. The large num
ber of candidates entered in the race—which
includes freshman, sophomore, junior, senior,
and graduate representatives to the Executive
Committee and two members each to Men's
and Women's Councils—is encouraging in that
it seems to wipe out the assertion often made
by critics of student government that interest
in student activities is waning and that it is
wrought by apathy and inertia.
Likewise it is encouraging to note the sin
cere desire on the part ot these candidates to
contribute to and serve student government

and to keep it alive with new ideas and new
blood.
The Election Board has checked qualifica
tions of nominees. It has organized a staff to
operate the voting centers and to insure a suc
cessful primary. The nominees themselves
have made an all-out pitch for support.
The rest depends upon the individual voter.
He should carefully appraise the candidates on
the ballot and make his choice carefully and
discriminatingly. He should have in mind the
candidates who will serve him most effectively
and efficiently.
' With that in mind The Daily urges its read
ers to get out and vote.
