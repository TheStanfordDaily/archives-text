### DICK MANSFIELD 
SHORING UP THE BANDHOUSE
A Tale of the High Cs
On a bleak day just after Halloween, two shapes
stole stealthily into the subterranean headquarters
of Inspector Wadleigh Faugh, upholder of justice and
prober of scandal on the Stanford camous since his

outright release by Chicago.
"Faugh," said one of the shapes,
"We represent the Stanford
Marching Band, widely hailed as
one of the best marching bands
on the Pacific Coast!"
"Indeed?" said Faugh, his keen
intellect grasping the import of
these words.
"Yes!" said the other shape,
"and there is rumor afoot that
here, after a successful year and

unbeaten season, the Stanford Marching Band is
going to be deprived of its bandhouse!"
"So!" said Faugh. "Are they going to convert it
into a new men's dormitory?"
"Worse!" said the first shape. "Some dark being
some fiend!—some dastard!—name unknown—plans
to fling our NOBLE bandhouse on the Big Game
bonfire!"

"I'll probe the rtbitter!" said intrepid Wadleigh
Faugh, and donning his cloak, he plunged out into
the log.
Later, the shapes again stole into Fqugh's grotto.
"Well, Faugh! What have you decided?"
"I have investigated the bandhouse thoroughly,"
said Faugh.
"And? What of the foul plot to put it to the torch?"
"My advice to you," said Faugh, "is to let them get
away with it."
The shapes were aghast. "But why? Why?"
"That bandhouse," said Faugh, "is a disgrace of
the first order. In all my days of probipg scandals,
I've never seen anything quite as scandalous! Bees
in the walls! Lights which blink on and off! Mice in
the manuscripts! Within the hour I saw a tuba
player go- through the floor! Last year they GAVE
the porch to the bonfire. Who would have to steal
the bandhouse? The band should gladly give it
away!"
"But we have nowhere else to go! That bandhouse,
mice and all, is our only practice space!"
"Aye," said Wadleigh Faugh, "that is the real puz
zle."
TO BE CONTINUED, UNFORTUNATELY, UNTIL
SOMEONE DOES SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

prober of scandal on the Stanford camous since his

outright release by Chicago.
"Faugh," said one of the shapes,
"We represent the Stanford
Marching Band, widely hailed as
one of the best marching bands
on the Pacific Coast!"
"Indeed?" said Faugh, his keen
intellect grasping the import of
these words.
"Yes!" said the other shape,
"and there is rumor afoot that
here, after a successful year and

unbeaten season, the Stanford Marching Band is
going to be deprived of its bandhouse!"
"So!" said Faugh. "Are they going to convert it
into a new men's dormitory?"
"Worse!" said the first shape. "Some dark being
some fiend!—some dastard!—name unknown—plans
to fling our NOBLE bandhouse on the Big Game
bonfire!"

"I'll probe the rtbitter!" said intrepid Wadleigh
Faugh, and donning his cloak, he plunged out into
the log.
Later, the shapes again stole into Fqugh's grotto.
"Well, Faugh! What have you decided?"
"I have investigated the bandhouse thoroughly,"
said Faugh.
"And? What of the foul plot to put it to the torch?"
"My advice to you," said Faugh, "is to let them get
away with it."
The shapes were aghast. "But why? Why?"
"That bandhouse," said Faugh, "is a disgrace of
the first order. In all my days of probipg scandals,
I've never seen anything quite as scandalous! Bees
in the walls! Lights which blink on and off! Mice in
the manuscripts! Within the hour I saw a tuba
player go- through the floor! Last year they GAVE
the porch to the bonfire. Who would have to steal
the bandhouse? The band should gladly give it
away!"
"But we have nowhere else to go! That bandhouse,
mice and all, is our only practice space!"
"Aye," said Wadleigh Faugh, "that is the real puz
zle."
TO BE CONTINUED, UNFORTUNATELY, UNTIL
SOMEONE DOES SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
