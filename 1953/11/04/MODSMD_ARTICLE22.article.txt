# Academic Freedom Is Subject Of USNSA Policy Statement
## 
### 
At the Executive Committee
meeting last week junior class
representative Guy Shoup read
the following policy statement
on academic freedom issued by
the National Students Associa
tion. Stanford, which joined
NSA two weeks ago, is free to
choose whether or not it will
ratify the NSA statement.
"The USNSA is in accord with the
principles of academic freedom as
expressed by the American Associa
tion of University Professors in Vol.
32, No. 4 AAUP Bui. Concerning
academic freedom, we believe that:
"1. The teacher is entitled to free
dom of research, and in the publica
tion of the results is subject only to
the limitations imposed by the per
formance of his other academic du
ties; but research for pecuniary re
turn should be based upon an under
standing with the institution.
"2. The teacher is entitled to
freedom in the classroom in dis
cussing his subject, but he should
not introduce into his teaching

controversial matter which has no
relation to his subject.
"3. The teacher has the right to
join organizations, whether religious,
political, or social, provided that
these organizations are not illegal
under the civil statutes, without
being discriminated against through
economic, social, or political pres
sures because of such activity.
"4. When the teacher speaks or
writes as a citizen outside the cam
pus, he should be free from institu
tional censorship or discipline.
"3. The basis for employment of
faculty shall be only their ability
to fulfill the requirement of the
position.
"Limitation of academic freedom
because of the avowed purposes of
the institution should be clearly
stated in writing at the time of the
appointment. Since the teacher is
a man of learning and an educational
officer, his profession and institution
may be judged by his utterances. At
all times he should be accurate, ex
ercise appropriate restraint, and
make every effort to indicate that he
is not an institutional spokesman."
