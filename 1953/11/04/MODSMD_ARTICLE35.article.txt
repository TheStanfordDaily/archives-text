# PUNTS AND PITCHES

### PETE GROTHE 
If Dr. Toynbee won't mind, we'd like to draw from his theory of history
repeating itself.
Go back to the year 1951. That was when they were scrapping it up
in Korea, when Dugout Doug Mac-Arthur was given the boot by Truman,
and when a lot of people started to talk about Ike for President. That i
was also the year in which the "experts" put Stanford fifth in the PCC in
the preseason ratings.
The "experts" didn't change their mind much when Stanford won their
first few unimpressively. Sure, a new boy-coach named Chuck Taylor
had a few great players in All-American end Bill McColl, quarterback
(iary Kerkorian, safety Hick Horn, half Ilarry Hugasian, and guard Jesse
Cone. But this was the day of two platoons, and man-for-man, there '
were two or three teams that were better than Stanford.
But the Indians kept winning games. No one knew quite how. Key
player after key player got injured. The opponents usually always scored
a touchdown or two before the Cards counter-attacked. But there was
a great ability for "come-through" performance on that team. The '51
team seldom ever won by more than a touchdown or two, but what was j
important, they kept winning. Manoogian would throw the block that
counted; Horn would make the last-ditch tackle that saved; Kerkorian j
would throw that pass that gained; and the net result was always victory.
The Tribe was an underdog against the Bruins. But a big fullback starting
his first game, named Bob Mathia.s, scored twice to beat the Uclans. Then, ,
the Indians went north to meet Washington and won a tight one, 14 to 7.
Stanford rang up seven wins, causing head scratching among the
experts. Then Southern Cal's ugly form loomed on the horizon. The
Trojans were also unbeaten, and no one except a few Daily sports
writers gave the Indians the slightest chance.
Even the most acid old grads can't help but get a lump in their throats
when they think of that game. With nine minutes to go, USC led, 20 to 13.
Then Mathias took a kick-off on the four and breathed in the yard markers
like they were hors d'oeuvers until he had scored. With three minutes to
go, Christ intercepted a pass and a few plays later Hugasian boomed over.
Final score: Stanford 27, USC 20. Rooters were so happy that they were
kissing people they didn't even know. There never was or never will be
another like that.
We now turn briefly to the year 1953. This season, like in '51, Stanford
was rated behind UCLA. USC, Cal, and Washington. The Indians lost to
COP and Illinois, and the Rose Bowl was as much a possibility as the
administration lowering the tuition to $5 a year.
But the Farm kids eked by Oregon and trounced Oregon State, a very
trounceable team. Then came the Pershing Square-blue Bruins, and every
body knows what happened then. It ranks second only to the 1951 USC
game.
And so. like in 1951, Stanford kept winning and no one really knew
how. Man for man, there are better teams in the league. But like two
years ago. the Cards rely on an electrifying passing attack and on
come-through efforts by Manoogian, Cook, and Wilson.
This week Stanford locks horns with Southern California, of which
there is none more despised. And like two years ago, the Rose Bowl is
in view. The IntHans must get by the obstacle that Coach Jess Hill's team
represents, to go to Pasadena. Of course, Cal is after that, and taking the
Bears is more important than 100 Rose Bowls. Also, like two years ago,
Troy has a down-the-middle power attack with big, aggressive linemen
ready to stop all thrusts, and a dangerous tailback in Aramis Dandoy.
Will history repeat itself? Will the Indians trounce Southern Cal on
the floor of the Los Angeles Coliseum?
Yes, they will. They will beat SC because never before have they had
so much incentive. They remember last year when the score was 54 to 7 and
when Hill kept his first stringers in to "pour it on." And some of them
know of a statement Hill made at a party this summer in which he said
that the score would be even bigger this season. And down deep in their
hearts they have a hankering to go to the Rose Bowl and settle a score with
Illinois.
They will win because Bob Garrett is going to pass like he never has
before, and the blockers are going to give him good protection. In the Cal
game, USC displayed serious vulnerability on pass protection. They can
definitely be passed against.
They will win because tackles like Ed Fouch and Mario Da Re can be
handled. And linemen like Manoogian. Tanner, Wilson, Wedge, and Armi
tage are going to play inspired ball.
They are going to win because runners like Ron Cook. Ernie Dorn. Jarvis
Watson. Bill Rogers, A 1 Napoleon, and Bill Tarr are going to prove that
Stanford is more than just a one-threat team.
History WILL repeat itself. The hated Trojan will succumb to Stanford
on the embattled Coliseum turf this Saturday.

writers gave the Indians the slightest chance.
Even the most acid old grads can't help but get a lump in their throats
when they think of that game. With nine minutes to go, USC led, 20 to 13.
Then Mathias took a kick-off on the four and breathed in the yard markers
like they were hors d'oeuvers until he had scored. With three minutes to
go, Christ intercepted a pass and a few plays later Hugasian boomed over.
Final score: Stanford 27, USC 20. Rooters were so happy that they were
kissing people they didn't even know. There never was or never will be
another like that.
We now turn briefly to the year 1953. This season, like in '51, Stanford
was rated behind UCLA. USC, Cal, and Washington. The Indians lost to
COP and Illinois, and the Rose Bowl was as much a possibility as the
administration lowering the tuition to $5 a year.
But the Farm kids eked by Oregon and trounced Oregon State, a very
trounceable team. Then came the Pershing Square-blue Bruins, and every
body knows what happened then. It ranks second only to the 1951 USC
game.
And so. like in 1951, Stanford kept winning and no one really knew
how. Man for man, there are better teams in the league. But like two
years ago. the Cards rely on an electrifying passing attack and on
come-through efforts by Manoogian, Cook, and Wilson.
This week Stanford locks horns with Southern California, of which
there is none more despised. And like two years ago, the Rose Bowl is
in view. The IntHans must get by the obstacle that Coach Jess Hill's team
represents, to go to Pasadena. Of course, Cal is after that, and taking the
Bears is more important than 100 Rose Bowls. Also, like two years ago,
Troy has a down-the-middle power attack with big, aggressive linemen
ready to stop all thrusts, and a dangerous tailback in Aramis Dandoy.
Will history repeat itself? Will the Indians trounce Southern Cal on
the floor of the Los Angeles Coliseum?
Yes, they will. They will beat SC because never before have they had
so much incentive. They remember last year when the score was 54 to 7 and
when Hill kept his first stringers in to "pour it on." And some of them
know of a statement Hill made at a party this summer in which he said
that the score would be even bigger this season. And down deep in their
hearts they have a hankering to go to the Rose Bowl and settle a score with
Illinois.
They will win because Bob Garrett is going to pass like he never has
before, and the blockers are going to give him good protection. In the Cal
game, USC displayed serious vulnerability on pass protection. They can
definitely be passed against.
They will win because tackles like Ed Fouch and Mario Da Re can be
handled. And linemen like Manoogian. Tanner, Wilson, Wedge, and Armi
tage are going to play inspired ball.
They are going to win because runners like Ron Cook. Ernie Dorn. Jarvis
Watson. Bill Rogers, A 1 Napoleon, and Bill Tarr are going to prove that
Stanford is more than just a one-threat team.
History WILL repeat itself. The hated Trojan will succumb to Stanford
on the embattled Coliseum turf this Saturday.
If Dr. Toynbee won't mind, we'd like to draw from his theory of history
repeating itself.
Go back to the year 1951. That was when they were scrapping it up
in Korea, when Dugout Doug Mac-Arthur was given the boot by Truman,
and when a lot of people started to talk about Ike for President. That i
was also the year in which the "experts" put Stanford fifth in the PCC in
the preseason ratings.
The "experts" didn't change their mind much when Stanford won their
first few unimpressively. Sure, a new boy-coach named Chuck Taylor
had a few great players in All-American end Bill McColl, quarterback
(iary Kerkorian, safety Hick Horn, half Ilarry Hugasian, and guard Jesse
Cone. But this was the day of two platoons, and man-for-man, there '
were two or three teams that were better than Stanford.
But the Indians kept winning games. No one knew quite how. Key
player after key player got injured. The opponents usually always scored
a touchdown or two before the Cards counter-attacked. But there was
a great ability for "come-through" performance on that team. The '51
team seldom ever won by more than a touchdown or two, but what was j
important, they kept winning. Manoogian would throw the block that
counted; Horn would make the last-ditch tackle that saved; Kerkorian j
would throw that pass that gained; and the net result was always victory.
The Tribe was an underdog against the Bruins. But a big fullback starting
his first game, named Bob Mathia.s, scored twice to beat the Uclans. Then, ,
the Indians went north to meet Washington and won a tight one, 14 to 7.
Stanford rang up seven wins, causing head scratching among the
experts. Then Southern Cal's ugly form loomed on the horizon. The
Trojans were also unbeaten, and no one except a few Daily sports
writers gave the Indians the slightest chance.

Troy has a down-the-middle power attack with big, aggressive linemen
ready to stop all thrusts, and a dangerous tailback in Aramis Dandoy.
Will history repeat itself? Will the Indians trounce Southern Cal on
the floor of the Los Angeles Coliseum?
Yes, they will. They will beat SC because never before have they had
so much incentive. They remember last year when the score was 54 to 7 and
when Hill kept his first stringers in to "pour it on." And some of them
know of a statement Hill made at a party this summer in which he said
that the score would be even bigger this season. And down deep in their
hearts they have a hankering to go to the Rose Bowl and settle a score with
Illinois.
They will win because Bob Garrett is going to pass like he never has
before, and the blockers are going to give him good protection. In the Cal
game, USC displayed serious vulnerability on pass protection. They can
definitely be passed against.
They will win because tackles like Ed Fouch and Mario Da Re can be
handled. And linemen like Manoogian. Tanner, Wilson, Wedge, and Armi
tage are going to play inspired ball.
They are going to win because runners like Ron Cook. Ernie Dorn. Jarvis
Watson. Bill Rogers, A 1 Napoleon, and Bill Tarr are going to prove that
Stanford is more than just a one-threat team.
History WILL repeat itself. The hated Trojan will succumb to Stanford
on the embattled Coliseum turf this Saturday.
If Dr. Toynbee won't mind, we'd like to draw from his theory of history
repeating itself.
Go back to the year 1951. That was when they were scrapping it up
in Korea, when Dugout Doug Mac-Arthur was given the boot by Truman,
and when a lot of people started to talk about Ike for President. That i
was also the year in which the "experts" put Stanford fifth in the PCC in
the preseason ratings.
The "experts" didn't change their mind much when Stanford won their
first few unimpressively. Sure, a new boy-coach named Chuck Taylor
had a few great players in All-American end Bill McColl, quarterback
(iary Kerkorian, safety Hick Horn, half Ilarry Hugasian, and guard Jesse
Cone. But this was the day of two platoons, and man-for-man, there '
were two or three teams that were better than Stanford.
But the Indians kept winning games. No one knew quite how. Key
player after key player got injured. The opponents usually always scored
a touchdown or two before the Cards counter-attacked. But there was
a great ability for "come-through" performance on that team. The '51
team seldom ever won by more than a touchdown or two, but what was j
important, they kept winning. Manoogian would throw the block that
counted; Horn would make the last-ditch tackle that saved; Kerkorian j
would throw that pass that gained; and the net result was always victory.
The Tribe was an underdog against the Bruins. But a big fullback starting
his first game, named Bob Mathia.s, scored twice to beat the Uclans. Then, ,
the Indians went north to meet Washington and won a tight one, 14 to 7.
Stanford rang up seven wins, causing head scratching among the
experts. Then Southern Cal's ugly form loomed on the horizon. The
Trojans were also unbeaten, and no one except a few Daily sports
writers gave the Indians the slightest chance.
Even the most acid old grads can't help but get a lump in their throats
when they think of that game. With nine minutes to go, USC led, 20 to 13.
Then Mathias took a kick-off on the four and breathed in the yard markers
like they were hors d'oeuvers until he had scored. With three minutes to
go, Christ intercepted a pass and a few plays later Hugasian boomed over.
Final score: Stanford 27, USC 20. Rooters were so happy that they were
kissing people they didn't even know. There never was or never will be
another like that.
We now turn briefly to the year 1953. This season, like in '51, Stanford
was rated behind UCLA. USC, Cal, and Washington. The Indians lost to
COP and Illinois, and the Rose Bowl was as much a possibility as the
administration lowering the tuition to $5 a year.
But the Farm kids eked by Oregon and trounced Oregon State, a very
trounceable team. Then came the Pershing Square-blue Bruins, and every
body knows what happened then. It ranks second only to the 1951 USC
game.
And so. like in 1951, Stanford kept winning and no one really knew
how. Man for man, there are better teams in the league. But like two
years ago. the Cards rely on an electrifying passing attack and on
come-through efforts by Manoogian, Cook, and Wilson.
This week Stanford locks horns with Southern California, of which
there is none more despised. And like two years ago, the Rose Bowl is
in view. The IntHans must get by the obstacle that Coach Jess Hill's team
represents, to go to Pasadena. Of course, Cal is after that, and taking the
Bears is more important than 100 Rose Bowls. Also, like two years ago,
Troy has a down-the-middle power attack with big, aggressive linemen
ready to stop all thrusts, and a dangerous tailback in Aramis Dandoy.
