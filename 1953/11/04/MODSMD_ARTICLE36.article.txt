## Ken LaCrosse Passes Sigma Chi's to 64-0 Win 
### HOMER SMITH 
In one of the biggest mural football scoring sprees in Stanford
history, the Sigma Chi footballers trounced, bounced, and walked
on the Frosh Medics to the tune of 64-0 yesterday afternoon on the
Indian intramural gridiron. The score was 33-0 at half time.
Indications of the impending disaster were given early in the

contest when Sigma Chi's Bob"*
Brown stole a bobbled pass on the !
Medic 10-yard line and went across
unmolested. The roof caved in
shortly after, and the deluge of
touchdowns continued uninterrupt
ed until the final whistle.
Ken LaCrosse, throwing to Scott
Jones, Fred Steinkamp, and Joe
Cox, kept the ball in the air and
kept it crossing the Medic goal line.
A majority of the scoring plays cov
ered more than 30 yards, and all
were either passes or returned in
terceptions.
LaCrosse threw a total of seven

touchdown passes; one was a two
yarder thrown underhanded to
Steinkamp for the fourth touch
down.
In one of the other three contests
played yesterday, the Phi Delt I
team made short work of Delta Chi,
19-0.
Other mural results were: SAE
won on a forfeit from Theta Delt
I, Sigma Nu dumped AKL 28-0,
and Chemistry edffed past Croth
ers I by the score of (5-0 in the
playoff of a game that had pre
viously been postponed.
