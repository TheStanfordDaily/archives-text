# PAST HISTORY
## Troy Holds Series Edge 
### BOB DURAND 
Four years ago at the Los Angeles
Coliseum, a strong Stanford foot
ball team squelched a supposedly
stronger USC eleven by a 34-13
score.
Two years ago at the same place,
a Rose Bowl - bound Indian team
came from behind to again down
the mighty Trojans, 27-20.
This coming Saturday, Coach
Chuck Taylor and his aggregation
return to the great oval-shaped bat
tlefield hoping once again to send
the Maroon and Gold down to de
feat.
As the two teams line up on the
gridiron for the opening kick-off,
many people will look hack over
the years on the 32 games between
the two schools that have made
up one of the most colorful series
on the Pacific Coast. USC pres
ently holds an edge in the series,
having Avon 17 games, while Stan
ford has 12 victories and two have
ended in deadlocks.
Freshest in the minds of many
will be that fateful day, Nov. 8, 1952,
when El Trojan visited the Farm
and handed the Cards their worst
defeat in history, 54-7.
Just as easy to remember, how
ever, will be Nov. 10, 1951, when
96,000 fans squinted through the
; thick .smog to watch All-American
Bill McColl, Gary Kerkorian, Bob
Mathias, Harry Hugasian, and com
pany record one of the great mo
! ments in Stanford sports as they
downed an eleven that had been
rated as one of USC's all - time
greats.
Some of the most vivid memories
of the series are those of the im
mortal Stanford "Vow Boys." It
all came about following the Stan
j lord-USC contest of 1932 in which
the Trojans, who were at the height
! of a long winning streak, won by a
13-0 count. That year Stanford's
! frosh team got together and
; "vowed" that SC would never beat
them.
The '33 Card team, with nine
sophomores on the first string, came
from behind to beat Troy, 13-7, and
end their winning streak. The fol
lowing year the Indians won easily
1 by a 16-0 margin, and in 1935, after
minutes of scoreless football,
Stanford's "Monk" Moscrip kicked
a 13-yard field goal to beat USC,
3-0, and to complete the "vow."
Some of the old-timers might
recall the first gridiron meeting
between Stanford and USC on
Nov. 4. 1905. A powerful Indian
team bullied their way to a 17-0
' victory over a weak but stubborn
Trojan eleven. . . . Coach Chuek
Taylor should remember the 1942
tilt when he stole the hall from
Mickey McCardle, one of Troy's
all - time greats, and dashed 40
yards for what proved to be the
' game's winning touchdown.
