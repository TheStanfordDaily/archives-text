# Indians Plan Rally in L.A.
## 
### 
The Indian Spirit will invade
S.C.'s domain Friday night in the
form of songs, yells, and Prince
Lightfoot.
Stanford rooters will gather at
Lafayette Park in Los Angeles at
9 p.m. for a pep rally, followed at
9:30 by an all - University party
across the street at Ed Crowley's
Town House. The exact location is
Wilshire Boulevard and Common
wealth Street, about a 20-minute
drive out from the Statler.
Pom-pom girls and Howie Ru
bin's yell leaders will be the main
attractions of the rally, since the
program consists largely of cheers
and songs. Prince Lightfoot will
provide entertainment as he
dances the traditional steps of his
tribe, designed to guarantee vic
tory.
Three rooms at the Town House
will be availableâ€”the Cape Cod,
the Garden, and the Zebra Rooms.
A special Stanford alumni reunion
will be held in the Cape Cod Room
after the rally, sponsored by Crow
ley, of the class of '29.
According to the S.P. ticket oflice
in Palo Alto, ticket sales for the
special rooters' cars on the "Star
light" Friday night are going "very
well." The two cars originally
scheduled are completely sold out,
and the company is contemplating
adding additional cars especially for
rooters.
Since the "Starlight" docs not
leave Palo Alto for Los Angeles
until 8:27 p.m. Friday, students
riding it will be unable to attend
the rally. The train is due in Los
Angeles at 6:45 a.m. Saturday.
Round-trip fare is $19.90. Reser
vations can be made at either the
S.P. office in Palo Alto or at the AS
