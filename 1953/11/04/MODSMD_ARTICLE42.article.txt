# Freshman Coed Tells Of Communist Perils
## 
### GERRY SMITH 
"Completely ruthless, not cor
ruptible, and fanatically dedi
cated to their cause" is fresh
man Ellen West's opinion of the
Chinese Communists, and she
has good reason to believe it.
Ellen was born in China and lived
there eight years. When her father,
the Rev. Donald K. West, a. Presby
terian missionary, first came to
China, the Communist guerrillas in
formed him that anyone who listened
to him preach would have his ears
cut of! and nailed to the church door.
They carried out their threat.
At the time, the West family was
living in Tsingtao, the last large
city to fall before the advancing
Chinese Rwls in 1949. During the
last few months before Tsingtao's
capture, the population of the city
doubled. Refugees came streaming
in, mostly seeking political asy
lum — Jewish Germans, White
Russians, and thousands of Chi
nese.
They lived in hovels, cardboard
boxes, any place they could find.
Often as many as twelve would be
living in a space too small for two,
Ellen commented.
The United Nations shipped in
food, and the missionaries distrib
uted it. One American dollar was
worth 30 million Chinese dollars.
The country was in a general state
of upheaval. There was little bank
ing or legitimate business. The Com
munists had infiltrated everywhere,
and all former non-Communists
were joining the group for protec
tion.
Some time before the Commu
nist threat had become so great,
Rev. West had journeyed into
Communist territory to ask for
the release of several captive
Americans. He and the rest of his
party were made prisoners them
selves, but were given the best
of care and were released after
two weeks. Then as the Commu
nists began closing in, every known
Christian was horribly persecuted.
"The Communists thought the
missionaries naive, gentle, and use
less," Ellen explained. "They brag
ged that they would conquer China
within the next few years while
the missionaries had been there for
100 years and had done nothing."
Tsinan, an inland farming town
on the fertile plains of North China,

was Ellen's first home. When her
family moved to Tsingtao, they lived
in the mission compound with six
other families for two years.
Tsingtao was a former German
resort town often called "Jewel
in the Kaiser's Crown," completely
international in atmosphere, and
located on the beaches of North
China. The % school children
represented IS different nationali
ties and nearly all spoke at least
three languages.
Nearly a year before Pearl Harbor
the Wests moved to the Philippines.
Everyone thought it would be years
before the Japanese would come, but
the Wests stayed only six months.
They were among the last to leave
before the Japanese captured the
islands.
When they arrived in the U.S.,
Ellen could speak Chinese better
than she could English.
Ellen'? own experience with the
Chinese Reds includes one incident
which she particularly remembers.
She was in a group who, by acci
dent, happened to be out after
curfew in Peking, riding in peddy
cabs or rickshaws drawn by coolies
on bicycles.
Suddenly they were in the midst
of a Communist demonstration. The
stx-eet down which they were riding

happened to be a legation street and
the Communists were protesting
"foreign exploitation" in front of the
legations.
A group of students appeared at
the end of the street and set up a
machine gun. By sheer luck Ellen's
party was able to escape before the
students started firing.
Despite some of her experiences
thei'e, Ellen likes China and is ma
joring in political science with the
idea of returning in the diplomatic
scrvice if it is at all possible.
