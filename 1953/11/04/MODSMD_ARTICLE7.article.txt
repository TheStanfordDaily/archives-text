# NEW JERSEY WIN
## Key Eastern Elections Go Democratic 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 (UP) j
—Democrats scored impressive |
victories tonight in a series of
off-year elections billed as an
anniversary test of the Eisen
hower administration.
I
They won the New Jersey gover- 1
norship in an upset, took the Vir
ginia governorship and New York
mayoralty by a landslide, and edged
into New Jersey's traditionally Re
publican Sixth Congressional seat.
The picture at a glance:
New Jersey—Democrat Robert B.
Meyner rolled over Republican Paul
L. Troast for Governor in a GOP
stronghold. Democrat Harrison A.
Williams defeated George L. Het
field in the Sixth Congressional Dis
trict.
(Williams' victory cut the Repub
licans' margin in the House to three
seats over tiie Democrats. The GOP
now has 218 members, the Demo
crats have 215, and there is one in
dependent, and one vacancy.)
Virginia — Democrat Thomas B.
Stanley snowed under Republican
TeH Dalton to turn back the GOP's
strongest gubernatorial bid in the
Old Dominion state in 30 years.
New York—Democrat Robert F.
Wagner, Jr., ran two to one ahead
of Repnblican Harold L. Riegel
man and independent Rudolph
Ilallcy to win election as mayor of
New York City.
The Democrats also held the may
oralties of Cleveland and Pitts
burgh. They also captured from the
Republicans the mayor's chair in
New Haven and Hartford, Conn.
In general, the returns were a bit
ter anniversary gift for President
Eisenhower, who swept to office a
year ago as the first Republican
President in 20 years.
Even though the races were lo
cal in character, Mr. Eisenhower
served notice last week he wanted
a Republican victory all down the
line.
Republican National Headquar
ters declined comment until the
New Jersey results were firmly con-,
elusive.
