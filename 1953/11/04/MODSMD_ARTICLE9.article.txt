# Football Round-up
## 3 DAYS TILL USC Bob Garrett Leads Nation's Passers 
### PETE GROTHE Sports Editor, The Daily 
Blond Bob Garrett, on whom so much depends this weekend,
ranks as the nation's top passer, according to the NC2A statistics
just released.
On Monday, the Northern California Football Writers' Associa
tion nominated Garrett, along with guard Matt Hazeltine of Cali-

fornia and COP end Ken Buck, as"
the Ail-American candidates from
this region.
The chant for Garrett for Ail-
American is gaining strength, and
the San Marino senior displayed in
practice last night why he is the
nation's leading candidate for Ail-
American quarterback.
Chuck Tay 1 or ran his team
through a long passing drill and
Garrett looked exceptionally good
on both the long and short flips.
John Steinberg was brilliant in re
ceiving. And Sam Morley, Ron

Bush, Ernie Dorn, and Marv Ten
nefoss were also on the receiving
end of many passes.
Bui the best piccc of news to
come out of last night's spirited
practice came from Trainer Con
nie Jarvis. He declared that tacklc
Barry Smith, out since the UCLA
game, has been pronounced fully
recovered from his head injury
and will he ready for Troy.
Smith participated in the scrim
mage last night, a scrimmage that
was devoted to defense against USC
plays. The Braves emulated the
Trojans and made little against the
defense. Impressive in the scrim
mage were Win Wedge, Matt Armi
tage, Ted Tanner, and Morley.
To ofT-balance the news of Smith's
recovery, fullback Bill Wcntvvorth
was declared out of the Southern
Cal tilt.
The statistics just released show
that Garrett has passed for 10
touchdowns and 1,036 yards. Gar
rett has connected 72 times in 127

attempts for a .507 averaged.
Garrett's two favorite receivers,
Morlcy and Steinberg, arc one
two in the PCC, and Ron Cook is
fourth. Morlcy has accepted 27
aerials for 314 yards and three
touchdowns; Steinberg, 21 for 31!)
yards and two scores; and Cook
12 for 1(»!) yards and two tallies.
Stanford leads the league in pac
ing offense and is second in total
offense.
Garrett, besides his passing
marks, leads the conference in inter
ceptions with seven and is fifth in
the PCC in punting with a 30.1 av
erage.
