five-power pact. It said, "The pie:.-
ent time particularly as the result
ot the conclusion of an armistice in
Korea is especially favorable."

very important international ques
tions mentioned should not be post
poned, then the objections in regard
to urgent examination of measures
to decrease international tension
disappear," the note said.
