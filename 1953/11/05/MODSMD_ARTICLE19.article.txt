# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
THURSDAY GRABBAG
The Utah University Chronicle has a sports writer
rimed Dick Bailey who is pushing Dick Hyland and
h ■ Examiner's Boh Brachmari for my affections.
Writes scribe Bailey in a pre-write for the Washing
i,n- Utah tilt, "The Huskies, who have been coming

up low, tromped Stanford Jast
week to prove they are up to the
Ijij.-, league strength."
And here we, in our ignorance,
had always thought that Stanford
won, 13 to 7.
FACE THAT BROKE THE
< AMERA DEPT. Dolores Morelli,
J Jura/id president, is an embar
tm.ed girl these days. A Quad
Ihotog asked her to pose, snapped
the picture, announced that the

- itinera had iust broken.
NOW IT CAN BE TOLD DEPT. The physics dept.
ha:; been keeping this a solemn secret for a year, but
finally the truth can |je "oared.
You've probably seen the clown in the circus who
throws a bucket of confetti at the audience who
thinks it is really water. Well, Dr. David Webster of
the physics dept., swinging a bucket of water in a
circle to demonstrate the law of centrifugal force,
• lipped. The class thought that it was water that
hot out of the bucket at them.
It was.

I SC FEVER DEPT. The greatest migration since
the ::wa!lows returned to Capistrano will take place
this weekend when Stanford students move by air,
m;i, arid land to the smoggy Southland.

Typical of the prevalent studies-be-damned atti
tude is Bob Murphy, star pitcher on last year's base
ball team, now a member of the professional Oakland
Oaks and in first year biz school.
Murphy is not a sophomore, mind you. He is a grad
student, and a pro to boot. But is he staying home
to study? No. Murph has a midterm Friday, a paper
due Saturday, and two more midterms Monday, and
he's going South.
Then, on the other hand, there's Barbara Tuerk,
associate editor of The Daily.
Barbara discourages me.
She is a nice girl and all that, but Barbara doesn't
git to football games. Where was she during the WSC
thriller? Studying. Where was she during the UCLA
sizzler? Exploring a creek (that's the truth). And
so when Barbara came up to me yesterday and said
she was flying South this weekend, I was more
shocked than a Roble girl who gets back at 1:30 and
finds she forgot to sign out.
"Barbara," 1 gasped, falling in a heap from the
sheer grandeur of it all. "You mean that you're flying
South to . . ."
'"Yes," she retorted, "to cover the NSA convention,
not to see the football game."
Barbara discourages me.
But at any rate, the trip will be great, the rally
will be great, and the game will be great, because
Stanford is going to win. And so, with my Rose Bowl
tie flying high, my white saddle shoes glistening, a
rally com girl tucked under each arm, and a saying
of studies-be-damned on my lips, I'm off for Los An
geles.
See ya at the Coliseum.
