# CAMPUS OPINION
## Conformity: A Vicious Circle 
### 
Td thn Editor:
I thought that perhaps you may bo interested in
knowing that the article printed in last Tuesday's
(Nov. edition of The Stanford Daily concerning
Stanford students' opinions regarding conformity as
a prerequisite to popularity gave a better picture of
conformity on the Stanford campus than was perhaps
intended. At least it gave indications of how con
formity runs its course.
All lour ol the four freshmen interviewed gave an
unequivocal "No!" to the question of the necessity of
conlormity. Here we see the naive freshman standing
on his heels and yelling "Individuality!"
Five out of the eight, sophomores interviewed con
ceded that, conformity was necessary "sometimes."

The other three gave a flat "Yes!" Now we see the
sophomores showing signs of weakening before the
pressure of conformity.
The two juniors interviewed both gave a hearty
should be necessary. Here the juniors show complete
surrender to conformity and glad of it.
Two out oJ the three seniors interviewed admitted
that conformity was necessary, but that it was not
necessary to themselves. The third senior was more
cautious and preferred nonconformity within bounds.
The seniors start the trek Ixick to individuality.
Conclusion: Is conformity necessary to popularity?
For freshmen, "No!"; for sophomores, "Sometimes";
for juniors, "Yes!"; for seniors, "No!" Vicious circle
isn't it? ASCANIO M. ROSSI
