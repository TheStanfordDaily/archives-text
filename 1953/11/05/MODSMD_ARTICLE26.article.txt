# Peerce to Sing Monday In Initial ASSU Concert
## 
### 
Jan Peerce, Metropolitan Opera tenor, will present the first
concert in this year's ASSU Concert Series next Monday night at
8:15 in Memorial Auditorium.
Peerce is in the course of his fourteenth consecutive coast-to
coast tour, including performances with the San Francisco Op-

era Company as Alfredo in "La Tra
viata," Cavaradossi in "La Tosca,"
and Turiddu in "Cavalleria Rusti
eana." He will .sing these roles this
year in his twelfth season with the
Metropolitan, where he will also ap
pear in "Rigoletto," "La Boheme,"
and "Lucia di Lammermoor."
Jan Peerce was born in New
York and was entirely American
trained, but has been praised by
Virgil Thomson, music critic of
the New York Herald Tribune,
and by Arthuro Toscanini for his
Italian bel canto style. Peerce has
been called one of his favorite
singers by Toscanini, with whom
he has appeared as soloist more
than a dozen times.
Peerce lives in a suburban home
outside New York City, but does
not spend much time at home. Last
summer, for example, he appeared
on a series of weekly radio pro
grams on a New York station and
fulfilled operatic and concert .en
gagements in the Hollywood Bowl,
Philadelphia's Robin Hood Dell, the
Cincinnati Summer Opera, Lewi
sohn Stadium, Evansville, Milwau
kee, and elsewhere.
Some time last season Peerce sang
before his thousandth audience;
these audiences have been located
in North and South America, Eu

rope, .and Israel, where he has given
tours.
Peerce sings French anil Italian
opera, oratorio, German lieder,
and popular ballads. According (o
him, "music is neither 'classical'
nor 'popular'; it's just good or
bad. And if I think a song is good,
I'll sing it no matter who com
posed it!"
He received an honorary degree
from the New York College of Mu
sic, as did Fritz Kreisler and Jascha
Heil'etz. Peerce was the first singer
in the 75-year history of the school
