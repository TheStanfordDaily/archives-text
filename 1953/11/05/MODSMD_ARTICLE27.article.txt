# KZSU to Air New Program
## 
### 
For the first time in history, Sta
tion Manager Jim Eaves announced
Tuesday, Stanford radio station KZ
SU will broadcast during the after
noon hours.
The broadcasts will be heard from
3 to 6 on Tuesday and Thursday
afternoons.
The new programs have been es
tablished to offer opportunities for
more people to exhibit their talents
on KZSU, while providing the Stan
ford listening audience with some
easy - to - listen - to popular music,
Eaves said.
The initial program on both af
ternoons is the hour-long Melody
Merry -Go - Hound, with Gorge
SchaelTer. This program is also a
milestone for KZSU, Eaves ex
plained, as il marks the first time
that a program has been rehroad
ca.st from another station.
Melody Merry-Go-Round origi
nates from KXKX-FM in San Fran
cisco, which broadcasts at 97.3 on
the FM dial. KXKX is the FM af
filiate of KEAR, San Mateo, which
broadcasts classical and popular
music, and is generally recognized
as the culture station of the Bay
Area.
Schaeffer's program is one of pop
ular music, specializing in late pre
releases.
The rest of the afternoon is
filled with various disc jockey
programs, which are yet to be
named or completely developed,
and these will be preceded by a
five-minute interlude of news at 4.
The program on both afternoons
at 5:30 will feature modern jazz, and
another five - minute newscast at
5:55 will end the afternoon broad
cast. The station will then return
to the air at 7 after an hour's silence
to resume ' its regular evening
schedule.
Eaves said he would welcome any
ideas, opinions, or suggestions con
cering this new innovation, or the
possibility of adding still more re
broadcast programs or broadcast
hours to the KZSU agenda.
