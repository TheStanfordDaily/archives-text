# RUSS WILKS
## The 						Inside Pitch 
### 
Chuck Taylor, who week after week looks through the silver lining and
sees the rust of his team's performance, stated last Saturday after the Cards
had pulverized Washington State that "SC can be beaten."
He added that "We'll have to play our best game."
Now, many people are going to say that Stanford can't possibly play a
better game than it did against UCLA. In reality, however, and in the words
of Mr. Taylor, "We had no business to be on the same field with them
>'UCLA) in the first half."
What Taylor means by "our best game" is that not only will the pass
ing have to continue to he great, hut the running game will have to
finally hiooin like a late season rose. The tackling will have to be better
than ever, and it goes without saying that the blocking must he there
for the running game to succeed.
This week Taylor has emphasized the running, and nothing would make
him happier than to see it finally go against Troy. The passing game is
the Cards most potent weapon, and if supplemented with a good running
attack, not USC, Cal, nor Illinois could stop the Indians.
