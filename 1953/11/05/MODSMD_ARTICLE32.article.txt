# From SC's Viewpoint
## 
### 
SC looks at the game from this aspect. They've read for the past seven
weeks what a lousy running attack Stanford has, and they've also read for
the past three weeks what a superlative passing attack it has.
So El Trojan, which has linemen as big as redwoods, has taken for
granted the fact that it will stop our ground game. Therefore, the big em
phasis is on combatting the aerial attack. There are two ways to do this,
both of which you can look for Saturday.
First of all, SC will hold up our ends. This is no easy job, as elusive
ends (especially Morley and Steinberg, who are more elusive than any
body in the conference) can employ several tricks (stagger step, shoulder
fake) which can fake an opposing lineman so far out of the park that he
will need a ticket to get back in.
However, if this tactic does meet with success for SC it will mean that
(Jarre tt will have to rely on short passes to the ends, who will eventually
get free, and fire the long ones to his hacks, namely Cook and Dorn. This,
however, is no handicap since the short passing game is usually Garrett's
best weapon, although, after last Saturday's long range bombing, we're
not so sure.
