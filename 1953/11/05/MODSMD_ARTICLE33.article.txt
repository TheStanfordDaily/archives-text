# Tactic No. 2â€”Rush
## 
### 
The second tactic SC will employ will bo to rush Garrett off his feet.
Again, this is no easy task, especially with the likes of rugged Bill Tarr
blocking. UCLA, which has a line similar to SC's and maybe a shade
better, was only able to get to Garrett twice in 29 tries. Washington did
a little better job of rushing, while Washington State did nothing. On the
other side of the ledger, SC hasn't been rushing anybody too hard. Sandy
Lederman, Washington's great find, was never touched by the Trojan line.
It lias been publicized this week that the maximum time it takes Garrett
to get r j ( | 0 f the hall is U. 2 seconds, and he usually lets the pigskin fly in
the two second area. Taylor, (his season, has counted on the defensive
cup to hold for five seconds which it has been doing most of the time.
So the Trojans have laid plans of checking the ends and rushing Garrett
unmercifully. But the old saying comes to mind, "The best laid plans of
mice and men gang aft a-gley," or in contemporary terms, often go astray.
The fact is that SC can and has been passed against. They rank fourth in
the league in pass defense.
