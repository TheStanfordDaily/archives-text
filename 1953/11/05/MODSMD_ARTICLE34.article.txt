And even if SC had the best pass defense in the nation, we would say
Stanford would still pass successfully all day long because it has the na
tion's top passer. Garrett throws high strikes to Steinberg and when that
6 ft. .'5 in. frame goes into the air it's almost impossible to prevent the com
pletion. Garrett pinpoints low bullets to Morley so that if Morley doesn't
catch the ball, nobody else will either.
Chuck Taylor admitted the other day that he knows where the ends are
going, but he doesn't know how they will get there. Taylor said, "We use
what we call a 'free lance' method to get our ends downfield. The end is
supposed to be at a certain spot at a certain time. But we never tell them
how to get there—just so they arrive."
Unlike a certain hypocritical sports writer on one of the Bay Area papers
(who said, in effect, that he would pick Stanford to win in order not to
spoil the Stanford rooters' trip to Los Angeles, although he knew SC would
win), yours truly envisions Stanford winning by AT LEAST two touch
downs. If the running game clicks, fine. But even if it doesn't, I can't see
the Trojans stopping our passing game. There's just too much Garrett.
