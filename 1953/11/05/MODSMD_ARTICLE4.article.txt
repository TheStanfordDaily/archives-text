# Football Round-up
## 2 DAYS TILL USC The 						Gathering Storm 
### PETE GROTHE Sports Editor, The Daily 
A dark cloud appeared on the horizon last night literally.
Tentative weather reports indicate that the heavens might be
crying this weekend when Jess Hill's brutes from Southern Cal
host Stanford's Rose Bowl-minded gridders.
A low pressure area was moving south and was expected to

bring nothing but dampness to Los
Angeles and to Stanford's passing
attack. The San Francisco Weather
Bureau predicted rain in Los An
geles today and maybe tomorrow.
It is possible that the storm may
have blown itself out by game time.
And it is also possible that the
weather man may be wrong, as he
often is. At any rate, the Coliseum
turf is well protected with a cover,
and so only rain on the day of the
game would have any effect.
Dripping skies would benefit
USC, which relies on superior
weight in the line and a strong
running attack. Strangely enough,
however, the Trojans have fared
the worst in the slippery going,
that is, against Oregon and Wash
ington. But, nevertheless, John
Steinberg, Sam Morley, Ron Cook,
and the other receivers will be
praying for a dry ball.
Stanford ran through a practice
session last night that stressed pass
protection, which was about as un
expected as Einstein getting an "A"
in a physics class.
The comparative weights of the
two teams just released shows that

the Trojans have a seven-pound per
man bulge. The SC line averages
212 to Stanford's 204; and the baek
field, 191 to the Indians' 187. USC's
team average is 204 to Stanford's
197.
Reports from the Southland in
dicate that ail the Trojans aren't
in top health. Aramis Dandoy has
a leg injury which prevents him
from cutting as sharply as he'd
like to. He's just as strong as he
ever was on straight-ahead plays,
but a Dandoy who can't cut fancily
might weaken SC's running attack
a hit.
The league statistics show that the
Indians have a better offensive rec
ord but a weaker defensive showing
than the Trojans.
Stanford is second behind Cal
in total offense with an average of
317.3 yards a game. Southern Cal
is fourth with a 27!). (i average.
In defense, the Trojans arc second
behind UCLA, having allowed the
opponents an average of 220.4 per
outing. The Indians have relin
quished 263.6 yards.

like to. He's just as strong as he
ever was on straight-ahead plays,

might weaken SC's running attack
a hit.
The league statistics show that the
Indians have a better offensive rec
ord but a weaker defensive showing
than the Trojans.
Stanford is second behind Cal
in total offense with an average of
317.3 yards a game. Southern Cal
is fourth with a 27!). (i average.
In defense, the Trojans arc second
behind UCLA, having allowed the
opponents an average of 220.4 per
outing. The Indians have relin
quished 263.6 yards.
A dark cloud appeared on the horizon last night literally.
Tentative weather reports indicate that the heavens might be
crying this weekend when Jess Hill's brutes from Southern Cal
host Stanford's Rose Bowl-minded gridders.
A low pressure area was moving south and was expected to

bring nothing but dampness to Los
Angeles and to Stanford's passing
attack. The San Francisco Weather
Bureau predicted rain in Los An
geles today and maybe tomorrow.
It is possible that the storm may
have blown itself out by game time.
And it is also possible that the
weather man may be wrong, as he
often is. At any rate, the Coliseum
turf is well protected with a cover,
and so only rain on the day of the
game would have any effect.
Dripping skies would benefit
USC, which relies on superior
weight in the line and a strong
running attack. Strangely enough,
however, the Trojans have fared
the worst in the slippery going,
that is, against Oregon and Wash
ington. But, nevertheless, John
Steinberg, Sam Morley, Ron Cook,
and the other receivers will be
praying for a dry ball.
Stanford ran through a practice
session last night that stressed pass
protection, which was about as un
expected as Einstein getting an "A"
in a physics class.
The comparative weights of the
two teams just released shows that

the Trojans have a seven-pound per
man bulge. The SC line averages
212 to Stanford's 204; and the baek
field, 191 to the Indians' 187. USC's
team average is 204 to Stanford's
197.
Reports from the Southland in
dicate that ail the Trojans aren't
in top health. Aramis Dandoy has
a leg injury which prevents him
from cutting as sharply as he'd
like to. He's just as strong as he
ever was on straight-ahead plays,
but a Dandoy who can't cut fancily
might weaken SC's running attack
a hit.
