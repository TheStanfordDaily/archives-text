The Stanford "Y" sponsors the
Sherman Tiny Tot Playground,
which opened last Saturday in a
district of South Palo Alto where
there were no play facilities for
children under eight years old.
During the summer, some of the
working mothers of the area started
the project; then it was taken over
by the Stanford "Y" as part of the
Community Service Program. About
20 girls, under the leadership of
Marlee Turner, are now working on
it.
The playground opened with a
picnic and Halloween party attend
ed by about 40 children.
The "Y" hopes to cotinue the pro
gram in a church basement in the
district during rainy weather.
