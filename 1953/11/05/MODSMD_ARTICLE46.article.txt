# ‘Walls of Troy' to Fall As Farm Unveils Card Magic
## 
### DAVE BROWNWOOD 
Troy's temple will crumble
Saturday through the efforts of
the Stanford rooting section.
For it will be only a temple of
cards — part of one of the 15
stunts planned for half-time en
tertainment. Rooters, via a card
Indian, will demolish the build
ing in about two minutes. But
those two minutes represent
many hours of work.
Rally Com members, for over a
week now, have been planning the
stunts, stamping the cards, and
painting pictures of the - stunts so
the rooting section can see what the
card section looks like.
Basically, the rules for doing
the stunts well are as follows:
1. Sit directly over the cards
under the seats so that every
group of cards is covered.
2. Before the stunts begin, put
the instruction card where it can
be seen.
Follow the instructions of the
card stunt leader carefully.
The instruction card has numbers
in the left-hand column, with cer
tain colors stamped in the blanks.
The number represents the number
of the stunt, the stamped color, the
card which is supposed to come up
in that spot in the section.
There are six cards, making a
total of 12 colors. Four colors have
a metallic finish—gold, silver, and
blue and red metallic (stamped m.
red or m. blue on the instructions).
Three types of stunts will be
used Saturday: still picture, flip,
and counting stunts.
For the still picture stunt the
cards are simply raised and lowered
on the signal.
The flip stunt is marked on the
instructions as if it were several
separate stunts. For example, Sat
urday numbers 3, 4, 5, and 6 will be
the crumbling temple stunt.
The rooter should put the next
color he is to turn up on the back
of his stack of cards, so that as the
leader calls the next number the
cards can be flipped over to make
the new picture.
The counting stunt is marked on
j only one line of the instruction card.
! When two colors are listed, the sec
j ond color will be followed by a
number. Rooters will flip to the
second color as the leader reads
their number. Those with only one
color listed for a counting stunt
simply hold it up throughout the
stunt.
Following the last stunt, cards
should be passed immediately to the
ushers in the aisles.

Follow the instructions of the
card stunt leader carefully.
The instruction card has numbers
in the left-hand column, with cer
tain colors stamped in the blanks.
The number represents the number
of the stunt, the stamped color, the
card which is supposed to come up
in that spot in the section.
There are six cards, making a
total of 12 colors. Four colors have
a metallic finish—gold, silver, and
blue and red metallic (stamped m.
red or m. blue on the instructions).
Three types of stunts will be
used Saturday: still picture, flip,
and counting stunts.
For the still picture stunt the
cards are simply raised and lowered
on the signal.
The flip stunt is marked on the
instructions as if it were several
separate stunts. For example, Sat
urday numbers 3, 4, 5, and 6 will be
the crumbling temple stunt.
The rooter should put the next
color he is to turn up on the back
of his stack of cards, so that as the
leader calls the next number the
cards can be flipped over to make
the new picture.
The counting stunt is marked on
j only one line of the instruction card.
! When two colors are listed, the sec
j ond color will be followed by a
number. Rooters will flip to the
second color as the leader reads
their number. Those with only one
color listed for a counting stunt
simply hold it up throughout the
stunt.
Following the last stunt, cards
should be passed immediately to the
ushers in the aisles.

Troy's temple will crumble
Saturday through the efforts of
the Stanford rooting section.
For it will be only a temple of
cards — part of one of the 15
stunts planned for half-time en
tertainment. Rooters, via a card
Indian, will demolish the build
ing in about two minutes. But
those two minutes represent
many hours of work.
Rally Com members, for over a
week now, have been planning the
stunts, stamping the cards, and
painting pictures of the - stunts so
the rooting section can see what the
card section looks like.
Basically, the rules for doing
the stunts well are as follows:
1. Sit directly over the cards
under the seats so that every
group of cards is covered.
2. Before the stunts begin, put
the instruction card where it can
be seen.
