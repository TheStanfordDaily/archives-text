# Farm Finance Plans Keyed to the Future

### WIN GRIFFITH 
(Editor's note: This is the second of two articles which explain the gen
eral financial situation of the University as related to the recent increase
in tuition charge. Yesterday's article discussed the present financial con
ditions and the background for the tuition raise.)

And what about the future?
Stanford's leaders are aware that the University is operating
under a deficit budget and that many of its reserve funds have
been depleted.
They are aware of the seriousness of this situation, but they
arc planning for the future accord-*

ingly.
Those plans are designed to in
crease the income of the University
to the point where it will keep pace
with costs, to the point where deficit
budgeting will be unnecessary.
Some of those plans have already
gone beyond the paper stage and
have materialized into specific ac
tion. They are:
1. The announcement to increase
the annual tuition rate for students.
Next fall undergraduates will be
paying $750 a year, an increase of
$90 over the present $660 charge for
three quarters. With a hypothetical
enrollment of 7,000 students, the
University would receive close to
$600,000 a year in additional tuition
income.
2. The increasing effectiveness of
(lie various University fund-raising
programs. Last year Stanford re
ceived a greater amount of money,
$3,985,471, from a higher number of
gifts, 12,009, than ever before in its
history. The University thinks that
the income source from gifts offers
the greatest promise for expansion,
and volunteer alumni groups have
increased and will continue to in
crease their efforts in the fund-rais
ing programs.
3. The initial development of
Stanford lands for industrial, com
mercial, and residential use. Al
ready 16 acres of University prop
erty has been developed into the
| "Stanford Acres" residential tract,
which will eventually have 43
homes. One industrial corporation,
Varian Associates, has completed its
$1 million plant on the southern
fringe of Stanford property, and an
other, Eastman Kodak, is construct
ing a $2 million plant.
Several commercial concerns
(Roos Bros., the Emporium, I. Mag
nin) have announced plans to lease
property in the proposed shopping
center near El Camino Real.
Within two or three years, ad
! ministration leaders say. the in
come nf the University will he in
creased by revenue from these
I and other phases of the land-de

velopment program.
And eventually, the income from
such land development, from gift
programs, from tuition, and from a
slowly increasing endowment will
enable Stanford University to keep
pace with the costs of its operations
and expansion.
