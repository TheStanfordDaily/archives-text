# Lozabnick to Head Stanford Delegation To MSA Regional Conference at UCLA
## 
### BARBARA TUERK Associate Editor, The Daily 
Members of Stanford's dele
gation to the regional conven
tion of the National Students
Association at UCLA this week
end will meet tonight to hear a
description of the workings of a
typical NSA convention from
Steve Voykovich.
Voykovich, now a graduate stu
dent in the School of Business, was
a national vice president of NSA
while an undergraduate at Fordham
University.
Stanford's delegation will be
headed by ASSU President Don
Lozahnick, Vice President Jeanie
Bohis, and Student Manager John
Stahr, and will include other stu
dent government officers and rep
resentatives from as many ASSU
administrative boards as possible.

Stahr estimates that transporta
tion and registration fees for Stan
ford's delegation will cost about $165.
Funds for NSA membership will
come from the ASSU contingency
fund—a special fund set up each
spring to provide for unforeseen stu
dent needs which come up during
the next budget year.
The total expenses now estimated
for a year's membership in NSA—
somewhere around $800—should not
amount lo over half of this year's
contingency fund.
Besides the regional confcrencc
this weekend, Stanford's NSA ex
penses will include $250 for na
tional and regional dues, and
transportation and registration fees
for delegations to two other con
ventions—a second regional one
next spring and a national meeting
next summer.
Exactly what NSA will cost can
not be foreseen, because the final
amount will depend on such un

known factors as how many NSA
projects Stanford decides to finance
and how many NSA publications
Stanford decides to use.
NSA stresses the need of defray
ing at least part of delegates' con
vention expenses so that convention
attendance will not be limited to
those students able to pay their own
transportation.
National NSA conventions arc
usually held in the Middle West, to
keep travel expenses as low as
possible for as many delegates as
possible.
Lozabnick announced at last
night's Excom meeting that an NSA
coordinator for Stanford will prob
ably be appointed for one year, some
time this quarter.
According to present plans, the
coordinator will have an ex-officio
seat on Excom, and will be respon
sible for serving as a liaison between
NSA headquarters and the various
Stanford groups which will carry out
NSA projects on campus.

transportation and registration fees
for delegations to two other con
ventions—a second regional one
next spring and a national meeting
next summer.
Exactly what NSA will cost can
not be foreseen, because the final
amount will depend on such un

known factors as how many NSA
projects Stanford decides to finance
and how many NSA publications
Stanford decides to use.
NSA stresses the need of defray
ing at least part of delegates' con
vention expenses so that convention
attendance will not be limited to
those students able to pay their own
transportation.
National NSA conventions arc
usually held in the Middle West, to
keep travel expenses as low as
possible for as many delegates as
possible.
Lozabnick announced at last
night's Excom meeting that an NSA
coordinator for Stanford will prob
ably be appointed for one year, some
time this quarter.
According to present plans, the
coordinator will have an ex-officio
seat on Excom, and will be respon
sible for serving as a liaison between
NSA headquarters and the various
Stanford groups which will carry out
NSA projects on campus.
Members of Stanford's dele
gation to the regional conven
tion of the National Students
Association at UCLA this week
end will meet tonight to hear a
description of the workings of a
typical NSA convention from
Steve Voykovich.
Voykovich, now a graduate stu
dent in the School of Business, was
a national vice president of NSA
while an undergraduate at Fordham
University.
Stanford's delegation will be
headed by ASSU President Don
Lozahnick, Vice President Jeanie
Bohis, and Student Manager John
Stahr, and will include other stu
dent government officers and rep
resentatives from as many ASSU
administrative boards as possible.

Stahr estimates that transporta
tion and registration fees for Stan
ford's delegation will cost about $165.
Funds for NSA membership will
come from the ASSU contingency
fund—a special fund set up each
spring to provide for unforeseen stu
dent needs which come up during
the next budget year.
The total expenses now estimated
for a year's membership in NSA—
somewhere around $800—should not
amount lo over half of this year's
contingency fund.
Besides the regional confcrencc
this weekend, Stanford's NSA ex
penses will include $250 for na
tional and regional dues, and
transportation and registration fees
for delegations to two other con
ventions—a second regional one
next spring and a national meeting
next summer.
