# Buss Gives Talk On Foreign Policy
## 
### 
Professor Claude Buss of the His
tory Department said last night that
he observes "little difference" in
American Far Eastern foreign pol
icy under the Democrat Dcnn Ache
son and the Republican John Fos
ter Dulles.
Buss was addressing a crowd of
about 75 Stanford students, profes
sors, and Palo Altans at a meeting
of the Stanford Area Young Demo
crats in the Little Theater of Palo
Alto High School.
He went on to point out how "far
removed" from partisan politics arc
the issues involved in U.S. Far
Eastern policy. "The issues in the
Far East," he said, "arc not fodder
for partisan cannons."
In discussing Red China, Buss said
he felt that China "is too big and
has much too much of its own cul
ture" to be run by Russia. He
doubted whether Mao Tse-tung is
jumping to Malenkov's whip-crack
ing and added, "The Russians know
little more about getting along with
the Chinese than the Americans do."
Buss feels that "the power is just
not there" for the Chinese Nation
alists to attempt a landing on the
mainland. "Formosa," he said, "is to
China what Catalina Island is to the
i United States."
