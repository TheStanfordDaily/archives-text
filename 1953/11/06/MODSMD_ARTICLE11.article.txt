# INDIAN ROOTERS TREK TO TROYLAND
## Cards Are 6-Point Underdogs for Coliseum Classic RAIN PREDICTED Garrett and Co. Seek Revenge, Then Roses 
### PETE GROTHE Sports Editor, The Daily 
An amazing group of Indians who just seven weeks ago dis
mally lost to COP and now are on the inside track to the Rose
Bowl will battle for their football lives when they meet fearsome
Southern California in the Los Angeles Coliseum tomorrow.
Kick-off is 2 p.m.
With delicious revenge the motive and the Rose Bowl the ulti
mate objective, 190-pound Bobby Garrett, the number one passer
in America today, will carry the burden of leveling the hated
Trojans.
There v/ill be no complacency among the Trojans tomorrow.
They realize that Garrett has completed 72 passes in 127 attempts
for a .567 average. They realize that every time the blond San
Marino senior wheels back and cocks his arm there's danger. And
they realize that in Sambo Morley, John Steinberg, and Ron Cook
the Indians have three of the best receivers in the nation.
They also realize that if they can get to Garrett before he gets
the ball off they will have Stanford licked. And this is one reason
why Taylor has been drilling his team on pass protection and
more pass protection.
INDIANS' RUNNING ATTACK
But don't be surprised if the Stanford runners roll off a lew
sizeable gains tomorrow. A Troy defense that is set up for passes
might be a setup for a Ron Cook or Ernie Dorn thrust.
Monday's scrimmage, which was a humdinger, was devoted
exclusively to running and even the hard-to-impress Taylor was
impressed.
But the Indians figure to make much less use of the ground
game than the Figueroans, who have in left half Aramis Dandoy
one of the best runners in the Pacific Coast Conference. The tail
back with the musical-sounding name is second in the PCC in
rushing with 411 yards in 75 cracks for a 5.5 average. He leads
in punt returns with a 17.4 average in 12 runbacks.
But Dandoy, like the other three starting Troy backs, won'l
at full effectiveness. The Trojans will field a backfield that might
go all the way or might fold in the first half. Dandoy has a multi
plicity of injuries and more often than not doesn't finish a gatnr;.
Quarterback George Bozanic has a bad knee, fullback Harold
Han has a sprained ankle, and right half Lindon Crow, SC's best
all-around back, an ankle bruise. The Hawaiian Han, a terrific;
driver, didn't even make the trip to Oregon and won't be at full
speed tomorrow. Addison Hawthorne, probably SC's niftiest
runner, will see considerable action at the fullback slot.
TROJANS FAVORED
The professional bettors think highly of the Troy ground attar V.,
so much so that they are making Jess Hill's mob a six point fa
vorite. But this is all right v/ith Taylor and his Indians. Stanford
does best when it's an underdog.
The latest report from the man who talks about the weather
but who never does anything about it indicates that there will bo
scattered showers Saturday. The Coliseum turf will be protected
with a cover; the field is fast-drying; and if the ball is wet it will
be dried every play, therefore assuring Stanford patrons of the
game that the Tribe will present a passing attack.
TEAM SPIRIT HIGH
The spirit has been higher this week in practice than any other
time since the UCLA game. As backfield coach George Lynn
said, "Our job this week will be to tone the team down, not to pep
them up."
The team wants to win this one in the worst possible way. They
remember the humiliating 54 to 7 defeat last year, and there arc
a few scores to settle.
The team is thinking only about USC this week, not the Rose
Bowl. Of course, if the Rose Bowl comes as a by-product of the
victory, the Indians will accept it.
A win against the Southlands would assure Stanford a tie for
the PCC title, since the Cards are the only team unblemished in
league skirmishes.
Victory over Southern Cal might give the Rose Bowl bid to the
Indians, even if they lose to Cal, which they certainly don't intend
to do. If UCLA wins its remaining games against Washington and
USC, the Bruins and Cards will be tied. In a case like this, the
Conference has always voted to give the bid to the team that beat
the other, Stanford in this case.
But it's Southern California, and only Southern California, that
Garrett, Manoogian, Cook, Morley, Tanner, Steinberg and mates
are interested in tomorrow.

Ends—Sam Morley, John Steinberg, Ron Rush, Marv Tennefoss, John
Stewart, Bill Scheidecker.

Monday's scrimmage, which was a humdinger, was devoted
exclusively to running and even the hard-to-impress Taylor was
impressed.
But the Indians figure to make much less use of the ground
game than the Figueroans, who have in left half Aramis Dandoy
one of the best runners in the Pacific Coast Conference. The tail
back with the musical-sounding name is second in the PCC in
rushing with 411 yards in 75 cracks for a 5.5 average. He leads
in punt returns with a 17.4 average in 12 runbacks.
But Dandoy, like the other three starting Troy backs, won'l
at full effectiveness. The Trojans will field a backfield that might
go all the way or might fold in the first half. Dandoy has a multi
plicity of injuries and more often than not doesn't finish a gatnr;.
Quarterback George Bozanic has a bad knee, fullback Harold
Han has a sprained ankle, and right half Lindon Crow, SC's best
all-around back, an ankle bruise. The Hawaiian Han, a terrific;
driver, didn't even make the trip to Oregon and won't be at full
speed tomorrow. Addison Hawthorne, probably SC's niftiest
runner, will see considerable action at the fullback slot.
TROJANS FAVORED
The professional bettors think highly of the Troy ground attar V.,
so much so that they are making Jess Hill's mob a six point fa
vorite. But this is all right v/ith Taylor and his Indians. Stanford
does best when it's an underdog.
The latest report from the man who talks about the weather
but who never does anything about it indicates that there will bo
scattered showers Saturday. The Coliseum turf will be protected
with a cover; the field is fast-drying; and if the ball is wet it will
be dried every play, therefore assuring Stanford patrons of the
game that the Tribe will present a passing attack.
TEAM SPIRIT HIGH
The spirit has been higher this week in practice than any other
time since the UCLA game. As backfield coach George Lynn
said, "Our job this week will be to tone the team down, not to pep
them up."
The team wants to win this one in the worst possible way. They
remember the humiliating 54 to 7 defeat last year, and there arc
a few scores to settle.
The team is thinking only about USC this week, not the Rose
Bowl. Of course, if the Rose Bowl comes as a by-product of the
victory, the Indians will accept it.
A win against the Southlands would assure Stanford a tie for
the PCC title, since the Cards are the only team unblemished in
league skirmishes.
Victory over Southern Cal might give the Rose Bowl bid to the
Indians, even if they lose to Cal, which they certainly don't intend
to do. If UCLA wins its remaining games against Washington and
USC, the Bruins and Cards will be tied. In a case like this, the
Conference has always voted to give the bid to the team that beat
the other, Stanford in this case.
But it's Southern California, and only Southern California, that
Garrett, Manoogian, Cook, Morley, Tanner, Steinberg and mates
are interested in tomorrow.
The traveling squad:
Ends—Sam Morley, John Steinberg, Ron Rush, Marv Tennefoss, John
Stewart, Bill Scheidecker.
Tackles—Win Wedge, Matt Armitage, John Stanton, Chris Marshall,
Barry Smith, Dick Gant.
Guards—Norm Manoogian, Phil W T ilson, Len Doster. Roy -Krickeberg,
Paul Revak, Joe Long, Joel Sappenfield, Tony Mosich.
Centers—Ted Tanner, Jerry Goldberg, Tom McKenna.
Quarterbacks —Bob Garrett, Jack Gebert, Don Kafka.
Halfbacks—Ron Cook, Al Napoleon, Loren Sorenson. Ernie Dorn. Bill
Rogers, Bill Tarr, Dick Crepeau.
Fullbacks—Marsh Howe, Joe Moreau, Dick Monteith, Jarvis Watson.
Head Coach Chuck Taylor, Assistant Coaches Pete Kmetovic, George
Lynn, Joe Rent/..
An amazing group of Indians who just seven weeks ago dis
mally lost to COP and now are on the inside track to the Rose
Bowl will battle for their football lives when they meet fearsome
Southern California in the Los Angeles Coliseum tomorrow.
Kick-off is 2 p.m.
With delicious revenge the motive and the Rose Bowl the ulti
mate objective, 190-pound Bobby Garrett, the number one passer
in America today, will carry the burden of leveling the hated
Trojans.
There v/ill be no complacency among the Trojans tomorrow.
They realize that Garrett has completed 72 passes in 127 attempts
for a .567 average. They realize that every time the blond San
Marino senior wheels back and cocks his arm there's danger. And
they realize that in Sambo Morley, John Steinberg, and Ron Cook
the Indians have three of the best receivers in the nation.
They also realize that if they can get to Garrett before he gets
the ball off they will have Stanford licked. And this is one reason
why Taylor has been drilling his team on pass protection and
more pass protection.

so much so that they are making Jess Hill's mob a six point fa
vorite. But this is all right v/ith Taylor and his Indians. Stanford
does best when it's an underdog.
The latest report from the man who talks about the weather
but who never does anything about it indicates that there will bo
scattered showers Saturday. The Coliseum turf will be protected
with a cover; the field is fast-drying; and if the ball is wet it will
be dried every play, therefore assuring Stanford patrons of the
game that the Tribe will present a passing attack.
TEAM SPIRIT HIGH
The spirit has been higher this week in practice than any other
time since the UCLA game. As backfield coach George Lynn
said, "Our job this week will be to tone the team down, not to pep
them up."
The team wants to win this one in the worst possible way. They
remember the humiliating 54 to 7 defeat last year, and there arc
a few scores to settle.
The team is thinking only about USC this week, not the Rose
Bowl. Of course, if the Rose Bowl comes as a by-product of the
victory, the Indians will accept it.
A win against the Southlands would assure Stanford a tie for
the PCC title, since the Cards are the only team unblemished in
league skirmishes.
Victory over Southern Cal might give the Rose Bowl bid to the
Indians, even if they lose to Cal, which they certainly don't intend
to do. If UCLA wins its remaining games against Washington and
USC, the Bruins and Cards will be tied. In a case like this, the
Conference has always voted to give the bid to the team that beat
the other, Stanford in this case.
But it's Southern California, and only Southern California, that
Garrett, Manoogian, Cook, Morley, Tanner, Steinberg and mates
are interested in tomorrow.
The traveling squad:
Ends—Sam Morley, John Steinberg, Ron Rush, Marv Tennefoss, John
Stewart, Bill Scheidecker.
Tackles—Win Wedge, Matt Armitage, John Stanton, Chris Marshall,
Barry Smith, Dick Gant.
Guards—Norm Manoogian, Phil W T ilson, Len Doster. Roy -Krickeberg,
Paul Revak, Joe Long, Joel Sappenfield, Tony Mosich.
Centers—Ted Tanner, Jerry Goldberg, Tom McKenna.
Quarterbacks —Bob Garrett, Jack Gebert, Don Kafka.
Halfbacks—Ron Cook, Al Napoleon, Loren Sorenson. Ernie Dorn. Bill
Rogers, Bill Tarr, Dick Crepeau.
Fullbacks—Marsh Howe, Joe Moreau, Dick Monteith, Jarvis Watson.
Head Coach Chuck Taylor, Assistant Coaches Pete Kmetovic, George
Lynn, Joe Rent/..
An amazing group of Indians who just seven weeks ago dis
mally lost to COP and now are on the inside track to the Rose
Bowl will battle for their football lives when they meet fearsome
Southern California in the Los Angeles Coliseum tomorrow.
Kick-off is 2 p.m.
With delicious revenge the motive and the Rose Bowl the ulti
mate objective, 190-pound Bobby Garrett, the number one passer
in America today, will carry the burden of leveling the hated
Trojans.
There v/ill be no complacency among the Trojans tomorrow.
They realize that Garrett has completed 72 passes in 127 attempts
for a .567 average. They realize that every time the blond San
Marino senior wheels back and cocks his arm there's danger. And
they realize that in Sambo Morley, John Steinberg, and Ron Cook
the Indians have three of the best receivers in the nation.
They also realize that if they can get to Garrett before he gets
the ball off they will have Stanford licked. And this is one reason
why Taylor has been drilling his team on pass protection and
more pass protection.
INDIANS' RUNNING ATTACK
But don't be surprised if the Stanford runners roll off a lew
sizeable gains tomorrow. A Troy defense that is set up for passes
might be a setup for a Ron Cook or Ernie Dorn thrust.
Monday's scrimmage, which was a humdinger, was devoted
exclusively to running and even the hard-to-impress Taylor was
impressed.
But the Indians figure to make much less use of the ground
game than the Figueroans, who have in left half Aramis Dandoy
one of the best runners in the Pacific Coast Conference. The tail
back with the musical-sounding name is second in the PCC in
rushing with 411 yards in 75 cracks for a 5.5 average. He leads
in punt returns with a 17.4 average in 12 runbacks.
But Dandoy, like the other three starting Troy backs, won'l
at full effectiveness. The Trojans will field a backfield that might
go all the way or might fold in the first half. Dandoy has a multi
plicity of injuries and more often than not doesn't finish a gatnr;.
Quarterback George Bozanic has a bad knee, fullback Harold
Han has a sprained ankle, and right half Lindon Crow, SC's best
all-around back, an ankle bruise. The Hawaiian Han, a terrific;
driver, didn't even make the trip to Oregon and won't be at full
speed tomorrow. Addison Hawthorne, probably SC's niftiest
runner, will see considerable action at the fullback slot.
