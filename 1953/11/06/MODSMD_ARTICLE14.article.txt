# What Went Wrong This Time?
## 
### 
Once again the validity of the results of
student government elections has been ques
tioned.
Wednesday night the Executive Committee
okayed by only one vote the election for the
Senior representative to Excom.
Arid yesterday students protested the valid
ity of the Women's Council election.
Long hours of work went into Wednesday's
primaries. Election Board had worked since
the beginning of the quarter planning for those
elections. Candidates devoted the past week
.md u half to introducing themselves to the
voters. Candidates' friends spent their after
noons and evenings drawing posters. Voters
11 ii d honestly to decide how to cast their votes.
Arid now people are questioning the re
sults of that work. Some people are even
c tiling lor new elections. % Why? What went
wrong this time? Why can't we ever just
have an election and forget it?
Some of the confusion in Wednesday's pri
maries resulted from sheer carelessness. The
last name of a candidate running for Women's
Council was misspelled and she lost by six
votes. Her supporters now wonder if all the
voters recognized the misspelled name.
Either Election Board neglected to check the
spelling of candidates' names on the ballot, a
negligence hard to understand, or they decided
that the misspelling didn't matter, a decision
still harder to understand.
We don't know how much time it would
iiave taken to have checked those names, nor
how much it would have cost to reprint the
Women's Council ballot. But surely, however
long the time, whatever the cost, it would have
been worth it so that now we could be 100 per
cent certain that the election was as fair as is
humanly possible.
The objections are even more complex in
the election for the senior representative to

Excom, the results of which were approved by
a margin of only one vote. Briefly, that officer
was elected on a preferential ballot, a system
not provided for under the constitution.
The constitution lequiies that in a primary
"each voter shall vote lor only one candi
date per office."
Despite this specific constitutional rule—
paragraph D of Section Three of Article Two
of the by-laws, to be exact — a loophole was
found and the constitution was by-passed. Em
ploying a legal technicality, Excom decided by
a seven to six vote that the students had waived
their right to a regularly constituted primary
by not having protested prior to the balloting.
Technically, the election is legal. And abso
lutely, Excom felt, justice was done.
But, and the fact still remains, we do have
a constitution, and one of Wednesday's elec- I
lions was not conducted according to the pro- I
visions of that constitution.
We know that there will probably be a new
constitution soon. And we hope that once we
have clear and logical election laws, there will
be a lot less election confusion.
We hope, too, that Election Boards from now
on will realize that one small careless error
can invalidate the results of a whole election.
We hope that Wednesday's example will show,
for once and for all, the need for the greatest
care possible, tire need to consider every tech
nical detail as being of the utmost importance.
Time and again we've all been put to great
inconvenience over these electoral details.
Last spring four elections had to be invalidated.
But we can't say it doesn't matter or it's too
much trouble. Student government is based
on a lev/ absolutes. And among the most es-;
sential of these are fair elections and a strictly !
observed constitution. About elections and
constitutions no carelessness can be con
doned. Barbara Tuerk
