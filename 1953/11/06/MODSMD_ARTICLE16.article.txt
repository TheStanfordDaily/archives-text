## Protest About the Election 
### 
0 the Editor:
Did Excom enforce the Election By-Laws of the
SSU Constitution or did they stretch them beyond
ny reasonableness in approving by a vote of 7 to (i
ie Senior Excom representative election Wednesday?
the students read the applicable by-laws (which
1 <• printed below) they can decide for themselves
hether Excom enforced the constitution or took the
ie easy way out.
The applicable by-laws of the constitution now read
billows, as published in the 1952-53 booklet
\ i tide II Flections
Section 3: Elections.
a. The preferential voting system shall be used
in filial elections . . .
I». In all cases where only one candidate is to be
elected, he must receive a majority of the votes
cast.
•I. There shall be primary elections for all of
fices regardless of the number of candidates
nominated. In the primary each voter shall
vote for only one candidate per office. If no
one candidate receives a majority of the votes
cast in the primary, those four candidates, or
three candidates if only three bona Hide can
didates should receive votes in the primary,
who receive the highest number of votes shall

he placed on the final ballot where preferen
tial voting shall apply."
In the Senior Class Excom representative primary
race, the preferential system was used. The winner did
not receive a majority of the first place votes—and ac
cording to the above printed by-laws, these first place
votes were the only votes that counted in the primary.
Though she had no majority, according to the con
stitution, Excom approved her as the duly elected
Senior Class representative. Is she?
Some of tho » members of Excom who approved the
election, apparently based their reasoning as follows:
Members ol Election Board, the ASSU President, and
other persons, trie! with the candidates and decided
that the preferential system would be used in the pri
mary. Since the candidates reportedly offered no pro
tests they felt, therefore, that the Election Board could
overlook the written ASSU By-Laws.
Haven't the voters the right to have Excom enforce
the election by-laws as they are written? Some mem
bers of the senior class are protesting this unconsti
tutional act of Excom and wish to have the senior
class Excom representative chosen in the final election
next Wednesday as the ASSU Election By-laws
tale it should be done. Either have by-laws that we
enforce or repeal thern. Be realistic—do it legally!
I write this letter as an individual.
