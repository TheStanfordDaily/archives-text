# 'Lady Windermere's Fan' Over-Staged, Under-Acted
## 
### JOHN JAMIESON 
The current Stanford Players' production of "Lady Winder
mere's Fan" fails on two major counts. First, because the acting
is not strong enough to make credible the wildly improbable plot
or overcome the structural weaknesses of the play. And secondly,
because stage movement is overstressed throughout the play.

Fundamentally this play stands or
falls by the emotional third act
around which the remainder of the
play is precariously balanced. As
trid Willsrud, playing Lady Winder
mere, handles this with restraint
and delicacy.
It is most unfortunate that Mrs.
Erlynn (Mary Elizabeth Reid) is not
convincing. The second half of this
act, which for all Wilde's virtuosity
is a little contrived, is well handled.
Cigars are smoked and epigrams

bandied with uniform eloquence.
Patrick Wymark, as Lord Winder
mere, gave a good performance and
was eventually the only actor with a
sense of period.
The first two acts arc overload
ed with plot, and consequently
both Lady Windermere and Lord
Darlington (Douglas Cook) hover
between woodenncss and melo
drama.
The character part of Lord Au
gustus Laughton is rather over
played by Charles Lyons, except in
the final speech which goes over
really well.
Rosemary Hays' the Duchess of
Berwick is deliciously affected.
Lady Agatha (Judith Doty)
moves beautifully but is made bla
tant in balancing the scene. She
should not close drawing room
doors—after all, my dear, we have
an excellent butler (George Ralph).
Overemphasis on stage move
ment continually detracts from
Ihe performance.
Mis. Erlynn in the final act is
given much unnecessary and repeti
tive movement.
The sets and costumes are truly
excellent.
