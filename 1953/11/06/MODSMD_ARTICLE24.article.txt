### MIKE HUDSON 
HO TOM NICKOLOFF 21!) REL 188 SAM MORLEY 11
Nickoloff and Carlton Massey of Texas were considered pre-season All-
America choices. Nickoloff has shagged 11 passes and is a top-notch de
fensive wingman.
Morley, with 27 catches, is third in the nation. He needs five more catches
to bring his career total to 100. Bill McColl is the only top college player
to previously hit the century mark. Morley has also improved his defensive
play about 100 per cent by playing a more cautious game. EVEN.
78 KEN THOMPSON 21(i RTL 215 MATT ARMITAGE 5
The mammouth Ed Fouch, who got the early season glory by recovering a
few fumbles after his team-mates had jarred the ball loose, has* been re
placed by last year's offensive starter Kon Thompson. Thompson was one
reason why USC's running game went nowhere last year.
Armitage has almost fulfilled line coach Joe Ruetz' prediction of future
greatness. He is especially sharp on defense, which is fortunate since most
of Troy's power plays will be directed at him. SLIGHT EDGE TO STAN.
5G GEORGE TIMBERLAGE 212 RGL 204 NORM MANOOGIAN CO
Timberlake is the latest in a string of All-American caliber PCC line
backers. He is the middle linebacker in the 5-3 defense, but jumps into the
line in the 0-2 where his effectiveness allegedly diminishes. He's a good
blocker, too.
Manoogian will be the sharpest blocker on the field although he will not
be without equals in defensive ability. He also excels in protecting Garrett
in the roll-out pass patterns. EVEN.
54 I>ICK PETTY 1% C 213 TED TANNER 51
Tlie battle of the unsung heroes. Petty, like Lou Welsh last year, is play
ing great ball. He backs up the line, blocks like a demon and is ignored by
the fans and writers. EVEN.
Tanner has backed up Stanford's crumbling defensive wall for two years,
and this year anchors a much improved line. He loves to submarine plays.
On offense he excells at the center's tough task of protecting the passer.
li 4 ED PUCCI 2Mi LGR 201 PHIL WILSON 66
Pucci is listed by George Lynn as USC's best lineman. On offense he is sur
prisingly fast as he moves from his weak side-guard position.
The lough Wilson has the unfortunate habit of running up against the na
tion's best in these Grid-o-Scopes. He has been Stanford's best two-way
lineman. Four of America's twenty best guards will be in action Saturday.
SLIGHT EDGE TO USC.
74 MARIO DA RE 215 LTR 211 WIN WEDGE 8
Da He was moved against by Washington and Oregon, and looked like
Leo Nomellinf against Cal. Since we saw the Cal game, we have to be shown
lliat he is not a top-flight tackle.
Wedge, who will be spelled by a healthy Barry Smith and an improving
Dick Gant, has held his first string berth because of his sterling defensive
play. He is only a junior, apd he and Armitage should be a top tackle tandem
next year. SLIGHT EDGE TO USC.
79 KON MILLER 205 LER 198 JOHN STEINBERG 12
Miller is an outstanding pass-catcher who is wasted in USC's passerless
attack. Al Baldock sees plenty of action here, too.
Steinberg, like Morley, is one of America's top ten pass snaggers with
21 catches. He rates as probably Stanford's best open field runner, and is
good enough on defease. EDGE TO STANFORD.
27 ARAMIS DANDOY 177 TBQ 190 808 GARRETT 17
The euphonious Dandoy is a pretty good runner and fish-armed passer
who is still among the PCC leaders in statistics (411 yds. rushing, 105 passing)
because of a great day against Washington State. USC still hasn't had a
tailback since Frank Gilford.
Garrett throws the Grid-o-Scope out of whack. He is so much better
than Dandoy, and so much the key to the Stanford attack that this position
is worth any two others. Garrett'is leading the nation in yards gained
passing and number of interceptions. What a ball player! EDGE TO STAN.
.18 GEORGE BOZANIC 208 BBF 192 MARSH HOWE 37
Bozanic gets our vote for one of America's most underrated players. Like
Steve Meilenger of Kentucky, he can play anywhere, he can do anything. His
parsing and interceptions single-handedly defeated <tough Indiana. It's tough
to beat a team with players like this.
Howe's booming blocking sprung several good run's last week. He hasn't
shown much carrying the ball, probably since he has only carried the ball
a few times this year. On defense he backs up the line. Jarvis Waston is in
shape again to spell Howe. EDGE TO' USC.
:i<; LINDON CROW 184 HBH 181 RON COOK 57
Crow was a great defensive back last year. He is a good runner, but his
defensive ability keeps a better one. Bob Buckley, on the bench.
Cook's 303 yards gained leads the Card ground attack. He has gone all
the way twice this year and might do it again Saturday. EVEN.
40 HAROLD lIAN 18(5 FBI I 175 ERNIE DORN 24
The poker-faced Han has moved out Leon Sellers who has run amok
against Stanford for the last two years, and stayed ahead of Addison Haw
thorne, a great all-around back who can't seem to blast into the first string.
Han and center Petty back up the line.
Dorn eoines from the midwest, which might account for his tremendous
drive and will to win. He's a sharp tackier on defense. USC SLIGHT EDGE.
USC average: 203; Stanford 197. Grid-o-Scope: USC 4, Stanford 3. 4 even.
Stanford has been working on their running attack all week, but, except
for an occasional trap play, we doubt that they will be able to move very
far against USC's fine defen.se. Once again we look for the whole offensive
load to be carried by Stanford's Garrett, who should move into the All-
American spotlight with another great day. USC will rush Garrett much
harder than UCLA, who for some strange reason chose to rush but four
men. Garrett may not have time to throw long, but, as in 1951, the short
pass will kill Troy.
As for USC. George Ceithaml has been added to the coaching staff to add
a little chicanery to the attack, but USC still can't put together a sustained
drive. However, they will capitalize on any break that comes their way, and a
crew of hard tacklers, good punt runbackers and the nation's top punter.
Des Koch, tend to make their own breaks.
The entire first string USC backfield is ailing, but second stringers Riddle,
Koch, Hawthorne, and Buckley are as good, if not better, than the starters.
We feel that Garrett can not be defensed. To beat Stanford, they must be
outscored, and Troy lacks the offense to do it. Stanford to win

USC average: 203; Stanford 197. Grid-o-Scope: USC 4, Stanford 3. 4 even.
Stanford has been working on their running attack all week, but, except
for an occasional trap play, we doubt that they will be able to move very
far against USC's fine defen.se. Once again we look for the whole offensive
load to be carried by Stanford's Garrett, who should move into the All-
American spotlight with another great day. USC will rush Garrett much
harder than UCLA, who for some strange reason chose to rush but four
men. Garrett may not have time to throw long, but, as in 1951, the short
pass will kill Troy.
As for USC. George Ceithaml has been added to the coaching staff to add
a little chicanery to the attack, but USC still can't put together a sustained
drive. However, they will capitalize on any break that comes their way, and a
crew of hard tacklers, good punt runbackers and the nation's top punter.

The entire first string USC backfield is ailing, but second stringers Riddle,
Koch, Hawthorne, and Buckley are as good, if not better, than the starters.

outscored, and Troy lacks the offense to do it. Stanford to win

Stanford has been working on their running attack all week, but, except

far against USC's fine defen.se. Once again we look for the whole offensive
load to be carried by Stanford's Garrett, who should move into the All-
American spotlight with another great day. USC will rush Garrett much
harder than UCLA, who for some strange reason chose to rush but four
men. Garrett may not have time to throw long, but, as in 1951, the short
pass will kill Troy.
As for USC. George Ceithaml has been added to the coaching staff to add
a little chicanery to the attack, but USC still can't put together a sustained
drive. However, they will capitalize on any break that comes their way, and a
crew of hard tacklers, good punt runbackers and the nation's top punter.

Steinberg, like Morley, is one of America's top ten pass snaggers with
21 catches. He rates as probably Stanford's best open field runner, and is
good enough on defease. EDGE TO STANFORD.
27 ARAMIS DANDOY 177 TBQ 190 808 GARRETT 17
The euphonious Dandoy is a pretty good runner and fish-armed passer
who is still among the PCC leaders in statistics (411 yds. rushing, 105 passing)
because of a great day against Washington State. USC still hasn't had a
tailback since Frank Gilford.
Garrett throws the Grid-o-Scope out of whack. He is so much better
than Dandoy, and so much the key to the Stanford attack that this position
is worth any two others. Garrett'is leading the nation in yards gained
passing and number of interceptions. What a ball player! EDGE TO STAN.
.18 GEORGE BOZANIC 208 BBF 192 MARSH HOWE 37
Bozanic gets our vote for one of America's most underrated players. Like
Steve Meilenger of Kentucky, he can play anywhere, he can do anything. His
parsing and interceptions single-handedly defeated <tough Indiana. It's tough
to beat a team with players like this.
Howe's booming blocking sprung several good run's last week. He hasn't
shown much carrying the ball, probably since he has only carried the ball
a few times this year. On defense he backs up the line. Jarvis Waston is in
shape again to spell Howe. EDGE TO' USC.
:i<; LINDON CROW 184 HBH 181 RON COOK 57
Crow was a great defensive back last year. He is a good runner, but his
defensive ability keeps a better one. Bob Buckley, on the bench.
Cook's 303 yards gained leads the Card ground attack. He has gone all
the way twice this year and might do it again Saturday. EVEN.
40 HAROLD lIAN 18(5 FBI I 175 ERNIE DORN 24
The poker-faced Han has moved out Leon Sellers who has run amok
against Stanford for the last two years, and stayed ahead of Addison Haw
thorne, a great all-around back who can't seem to blast into the first string.
Han and center Petty back up the line.
Dorn eoines from the midwest, which might account for his tremendous
drive and will to win. He's a sharp tackier on defense. USC SLIGHT EDGE.
USC average: 203; Stanford 197. Grid-o-Scope: USC 4, Stanford 3. 4 even.
Stanford has been working on their running attack all week, but, except
for an occasional trap play, we doubt that they will be able to move very
far against USC's fine defen.se. Once again we look for the whole offensive
load to be carried by Stanford's Garrett, who should move into the All-
American spotlight with another great day. USC will rush Garrett much
harder than UCLA, who for some strange reason chose to rush but four
men. Garrett may not have time to throw long, but, as in 1951, the short
pass will kill Troy.
As for USC. George Ceithaml has been added to the coaching staff to add
a little chicanery to the attack, but USC still can't put together a sustained
drive. However, they will capitalize on any break that comes their way, and a
crew of hard tacklers, good punt runbackers and the nation's top punter.
Des Koch, tend to make their own breaks.
The entire first string USC backfield is ailing, but second stringers Riddle,
Koch, Hawthorne, and Buckley are as good, if not better, than the starters.
We feel that Garrett can not be defensed. To beat Stanford, they must be
outscored, and Troy lacks the offense to do it. Stanford to win
HO TOM NICKOLOFF 21!) REL 188 SAM MORLEY 11
Nickoloff and Carlton Massey of Texas were considered pre-season All-
America choices. Nickoloff has shagged 11 passes and is a top-notch de
fensive wingman.
Morley, with 27 catches, is third in the nation. He needs five more catches
to bring his career total to 100. Bill McColl is the only top college player
to previously hit the century mark. Morley has also improved his defensive
play about 100 per cent by playing a more cautious game. EVEN.
78 KEN THOMPSON 21(i RTL 215 MATT ARMITAGE 5
The mammouth Ed Fouch, who got the early season glory by recovering a
few fumbles after his team-mates had jarred the ball loose, has* been re
placed by last year's offensive starter Kon Thompson. Thompson was one
reason why USC's running game went nowhere last year.
Armitage has almost fulfilled line coach Joe Ruetz' prediction of future
greatness. He is especially sharp on defense, which is fortunate since most
of Troy's power plays will be directed at him. SLIGHT EDGE TO STAN.
5G GEORGE TIMBERLAGE 212 RGL 204 NORM MANOOGIAN CO
Timberlake is the latest in a string of All-American caliber PCC line
backers. He is the middle linebacker in the 5-3 defense, but jumps into the
line in the 0-2 where his effectiveness allegedly diminishes. He's a good
blocker, too.
Manoogian will be the sharpest blocker on the field although he will not
be without equals in defensive ability. He also excels in protecting Garrett
in the roll-out pass patterns. EVEN.
54 I>ICK PETTY 1% C 213 TED TANNER 51
Tlie battle of the unsung heroes. Petty, like Lou Welsh last year, is play
ing great ball. He backs up the line, blocks like a demon and is ignored by
the fans and writers. EVEN.
Tanner has backed up Stanford's crumbling defensive wall for two years,
and this year anchors a much improved line. He loves to submarine plays.
On offense he excells at the center's tough task of protecting the passer.
li 4 ED PUCCI 2Mi LGR 201 PHIL WILSON 66
Pucci is listed by George Lynn as USC's best lineman. On offense he is sur
prisingly fast as he moves from his weak side-guard position.
The lough Wilson has the unfortunate habit of running up against the na
tion's best in these Grid-o-Scopes. He has been Stanford's best two-way
lineman. Four of America's twenty best guards will be in action Saturday.
SLIGHT EDGE TO USC.
74 MARIO DA RE 215 LTR 211 WIN WEDGE 8
Da He was moved against by Washington and Oregon, and looked like
Leo Nomellinf against Cal. Since we saw the Cal game, we have to be shown
lliat he is not a top-flight tackle.
Wedge, who will be spelled by a healthy Barry Smith and an improving
Dick Gant, has held his first string berth because of his sterling defensive
play. He is only a junior, apd he and Armitage should be a top tackle tandem
next year. SLIGHT EDGE TO USC.
79 KON MILLER 205 LER 198 JOHN STEINBERG 12
Miller is an outstanding pass-catcher who is wasted in USC's passerless
attack. Al Baldock sees plenty of action here, too.
