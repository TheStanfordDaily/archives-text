# Tough Picks Face Staff
## 
### 
With a bevy of toughies to con- j
front our prognosticators, this week- j
end should separate the men from 112
the boys or the administration from
the sports scribes.
After three weeks of superiority,
head prognosticator Don Stephens
has given up his top spot to Irwin
Johnson on a sharing basis, while |
the only man who gets paid for be- !
ing an expert on football, Chuck |
Taylor, is at the bottom of the list. I
Coach Chuck is putting his hot- !
tom-of-the-barrel record on the
line by selecting the Indians to j
whip Troy Saturday. If Taylor's
past record as a picker is any in- '
dication, the team then has slight- !
ly better than a 50-50 chance of
doinft the job. None of the pick- j
ers has either the nerve or the de
sire to pick (he Trojans, however.
Other unanimous selections were I
Baylor over Texas, Notre Dame
over Penn, and Texas Christian over |
the recently lacerated Cougars of
Washington State.
