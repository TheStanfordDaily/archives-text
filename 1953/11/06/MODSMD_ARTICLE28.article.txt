# UPSET DOPESTERS?
## Experts Say Troy by Six 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. 5 (UP)—
I The two most explosive football
teams on the West Coast—Stanford
and Southern California—tangle be
fore 80,000 fans in the Loc= Angeles
Coliseum tomorrow and if the In
dians win they will be headed for
i the Rose Bowl.
The Trojans can't go, no matter
what happens, because they were
there last year. But the amazing
Stanford club could duplicate its
1951 "rags to riches" story with a
victory.
On USC should win with
ease. They have the most roek
-1 ribbed defense ii. the West; and
they have a great individual per
former in Aramis Dandoy, the
| great hack. They are regarded as
{ "real rugged."
"But I don't think they are that

good—or that rugged," says Taylor,
'i can't see where USC would be
any tougher than UCLA. And we
beat UCLA."
The experts rate it this way:
1. Stanford's line never will he
able to stand up against the hard
charging forward wall built by
Coach Jess Ilill.
2. The USC line will charge
through so fast that it will upset
the bomb-sight passing accuracy
of Stanford's Bobby Garrett.
If Garrett is unable to pass,
the Indians don't have a ghost
of a chance to win because they
have absolutely no running attack.
On the other hand, USC has had a
noticeable weakness in its pass de
fense. Cal, beaten 32-20 by the Tro
jans, set up its three touchdowns via
the aerial route; Oregon, which up
set USC two weeks ago, made both
its marches for counters through the
air. Neither of these clubs has a
passer to compare with Garrett.
Coach Chuck Taylor of the In
dians, who formerly played and
coached in the professional ranks,
has adopted the pro theory of two
passes for every running play—
just the opposite of that used
mostly by college coaches. So far
it has paid big dividends.
