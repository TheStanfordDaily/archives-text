# Election Board Nullifies Women's Council Election
## 
### 
The election for Women's Council, held Wednesday and ap
proved by the Executive Committee that evening, has been in
validated and will be held again next Wednesday at the general
election, ASSU President Don Lozabnick reported last night.
Nullification of the election was ordered by the Election Board

and the president after students
protested that the name of one of
the losing candidates was misspelled
on the primary ballot.
The name of Jean McClure^ re
portedly appeared as Jean "Mc-
Clune" on the ballot.
M iss McClurc was said nffiically
to have missed winning one of the
two posts open on the Council by
six votes. Those who protested
the election contended that some
voters might have been misled as
to the identity of the candidate by
the inaccurate spelling.
In Wednesday's primary, Jan
Cline and Lynn Ferguson received
the most votes, and their election
was approved by Excom after no
immediate protests were recorded.
Complaints over the election were
first presented to Larry Tarlow,
chairman of the Election Board, and
other election officials early yester
day afternoon.
The full slate of five candidates,
including Sara Packard and Jo Ci
nevra, will be placed on the general
election ballot.
