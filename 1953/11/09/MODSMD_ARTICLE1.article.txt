# Cal Student Group Foiled in Bonfire Plot
## 
### 
Stanford officials plan to notify University of California au
thorities today about the fantastic attempt by a group of UC stu
dents to "burn up" the Stanford Big Game bonfire woodpile in
Lake Lagunita early Saturday morning.
The students were thwarted in their attempt to set the woodpile

ablaze by Stanford police who*
spotted them laying some 300
feet of wire under the dry lake
bed of the lake leading to the wood
pile site. The students had planned

the scheduled date when Stanford
holds its Big Game rally and bon
fire, to attach an incendiary ex
plosive to the end of the wire
under the woodpile.
He vehemently denied that the
group was planning to use dynamite.
He said they .were planning to use

to return later to attach an incendi
ary explosive to the end of the wire.
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler said yesterday that UC au
thorities will be notified about the
plot under terms of the Big Game
non-aggression pact signed by rep
resentatives of both Stanford and
UC last weekend.
"We have no alternative under
the pact," Winbigler pointed out,
"but to report any violations or al
leged violations of the pact."
The plan—one of the most unusual
schemes ever conceived over the
years that UC students have at
tempted to upset the bonfire wood
pile—was described by police in this
manner:
Officer Robert Truesdell, patroling
along Foothill Road near the lake,
saw a parked car and the four stu
dents working in the center of the
lake.
The students fled when they spot
ted the officer approaching them and
left their car behind. Police im
pounded the car, and yesterday it
had reportedly been returned to the
student-owner.
However, Wesley Stuper, 23, sen
ior at UC, was apprehended on the
Stanford campus later.
Another student, who identified
himself as Kenneth L. Heikinen, 20,
was picked up by Palo Alto police
officer Anthony Poso on El Camino
Real when trying to hitch a ride to
Berkeley.
The two other students disap
peared.
Police found no explosives at the
scene of the woodpile, but Stuper,
who lives in Barrington Hail on
the UC Berkeley campus, told The
Daily yesterday that the group
planned to return before Nov. I!),


SAD SAM'S BIG MOMENT — Little Sam Tsagalakis has his
greatest moment as he boots Southern California to a 23-20 vic
tory over Stanford in the last 14 seconds of the game played in

Los Angeles Coliseum Saturday. Tsagalakis, a 157-lb. senior,
was kept on the Trojan sguad by Coach Jess Hill for the sole
purpose of kicking extra points and placements from the field.

He performed his job well. Too well, thougnt the scores of Stan
ford partisans who made up part of the huge throng of white
shirted viewers sweltering in the 90-degree heat. Quarterback

George Bozanic is holding the ball for Tsagalak j, as Indian line
men try futilely to block the dramatic placement.

in fine grains with some metallic
oxide, which- would touch off an in
cendiary detonation instead of a vio
lent explosion by dynamite which
would obviously blast the woodpile
, i ky high into smithereens.
Stuper said that about one-third
of the wiring hail been completed
before the students fled.
lie added that the plan was
worked out as a "retaliatory"
measure against a group of Stan
ford students who, he said, re
portedly stole the Stanford Axe
from LIC last June.
Stuper reported that so far he lias
not been questioned further about
the incident by either Stanford or
UC authorities and, he added, "I'm
not worried."
Dick Mansfield, chairman of the
bonfire committee here, said that
no damage was done. "We'll huild
the bonfire as planned," he said.
"The freshmen start guarding the
bonfire area Monday, and after
that Cal won't have another chance
to foul us up."
The campus was the scene of other

pranks Saturday morning.
Officer Truesdell said he saw a car
parked without lights at the Palo
Alto end of Palm Drive at 2:30 a.m.
The car disappeared before Trues
dell could get to it, but he found 18-
inch letter "C's" in black paint on
both pillars leading to the campus.
Truesdell and officer Ben Hickey
later found an additional "C" in
front of Cubberley Hall, and "CAL"
painted on the sidewalk in front of
the Bookstore.
Stuper denied that his group was
responsible for painting the "C's"
about the Stanford campus.
Ralph Vctterlein, president of the
Associated Students of IJC, said yes
terday he thought the paint job
might have been done by the same
group of students who have been
slapping black paint on UC land
marks such as the senior bench and
the big "C."

SAD SAM'S BIG MOMENT — Little Sam Tsagalakis has his
greatest moment as he boots Southern California to a 23-20 vic
tory over Stanford in the last 14 seconds of the game played in

Los Angeles Coliseum Saturday. Tsagalakis, a 157-lb. senior,
was kept on the Trojan sguad by Coach Jess Hill for the sole
purpose of kicking extra points and placements from the field.

He performed his job well. Too well, thougnt the scores of Stan
ford partisans who made up part of the huge throng of white
shirted viewers sweltering in the 90-degree heat. Quarterback

George Bozanic is holding the ball for Tsagalak j, as Indian line
men try futilely to block the dramatic placement.

in fine grains with some metallic
oxide, which- would touch off an in
cendiary detonation instead of a vio
lent explosion by dynamite which
would obviously blast the woodpile
, i ky high into smithereens.
Stuper said that about one-third
of the wiring hail been completed
before the students fled.
lie added that the plan was
worked out as a "retaliatory"
measure against a group of Stan
ford students who, he said, re
portedly stole the Stanford Axe
from LIC last June.
Stuper reported that so far he lias
not been questioned further about
the incident by either Stanford or
UC authorities and, he added, "I'm
not worried."
Dick Mansfield, chairman of the
bonfire committee here, said that
no damage was done. "We'll huild
the bonfire as planned," he said.
"The freshmen start guarding the
bonfire area Monday, and after
that Cal won't have another chance
to foul us up."
The campus was the scene of other

pranks Saturday morning.
Officer Truesdell said he saw a car
parked without lights at the Palo
Alto end of Palm Drive at 2:30 a.m.
The car disappeared before Trues
dell could get to it, but he found 18-
inch letter "C's" in black paint on
both pillars leading to the campus.
Truesdell and officer Ben Hickey
later found an additional "C" in
front of Cubberley Hall, and "CAL"
painted on the sidewalk in front of
the Bookstore.
Stuper denied that his group was
responsible for painting the "C's"
about the Stanford campus.
Ralph Vctterlein, president of the
Associated Students of IJC, said yes
terday he thought the paint job
might have been done by the same
group of students who have been
slapping black paint on UC land
marks such as the senior bench and
the big "C."
Stanford officials plan to notify University of California au
thorities today about the fantastic attempt by a group of UC stu
dents to "burn up" the Stanford Big Game bonfire woodpile in
Lake Lagunita early Saturday morning.
The students were thwarted in their attempt to set the woodpile

ablaze by Stanford police who*
spotted them laying some 300
feet of wire under the dry lake
bed of the lake leading to the wood
pile site. The students had planned

the scheduled date when Stanford
holds its Big Game rally and bon
fire, to attach an incendiary ex
plosive to the end of the wire
under the woodpile.
He vehemently denied that the
group was planning to use dynamite.
He said they .were planning to use

to return later to attach an incendi
ary explosive to the end of the wire.
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler said yesterday that UC au
thorities will be notified about the
plot under terms of the Big Game
non-aggression pact signed by rep
resentatives of both Stanford and
UC last weekend.
"We have no alternative under
the pact," Winbigler pointed out,
"but to report any violations or al
leged violations of the pact."
The plan—one of the most unusual
schemes ever conceived over the
years that UC students have at
tempted to upset the bonfire wood
pile—was described by police in this
manner:
Officer Robert Truesdell, patroling
along Foothill Road near the lake,
saw a parked car and the four stu
dents working in the center of the
lake.
The students fled when they spot
ted the officer approaching them and
left their car behind. Police im
pounded the car, and yesterday it
had reportedly been returned to the
student-owner.
However, Wesley Stuper, 23, sen
ior at UC, was apprehended on the
Stanford campus later.
Another student, who identified
himself as Kenneth L. Heikinen, 20,

The campus was the scene of other

pranks Saturday morning.
Officer Truesdell said he saw a car
parked without lights at the Palo
Alto end of Palm Drive at 2:30 a.m.
The car disappeared before Trues
dell could get to it, but he found 18-
inch letter "C's" in black paint on

Truesdell and officer Ben Hickey
later found an additional "C" in
front of Cubberley Hall, and "CAL"
painted on the sidewalk in front of
the Bookstore.
Stuper denied that his group was
responsible for painting the "C's"
about the Stanford campus.
Ralph Vctterlein, president of the
Associated Students of IJC, said yes
terday he thought the paint job
might have been done by the same
group of students who have been
slapping black paint on UC land
marks such as the senior bench and
the big "C."
Stanford officials plan to notify University of California au
thorities today about the fantastic attempt by a group of UC stu
dents to "burn up" the Stanford Big Game bonfire woodpile in
Lake Lagunita early Saturday morning.
The students were thwarted in their attempt to set the woodpile

ablaze by Stanford police who*
spotted them laying some 300
feet of wire under the dry lake
bed of the lake leading to the wood
pile site. The students had planned

the scheduled date when Stanford
holds its Big Game rally and bon
fire, to attach an incendiary ex
plosive to the end of the wire
under the woodpile.
He vehemently denied that the
group was planning to use dynamite.
He said they .were planning to use

to return later to attach an incendi
ary explosive to the end of the wire.
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler said yesterday that UC au
thorities will be notified about the
plot under terms of the Big Game
non-aggression pact signed by rep
resentatives of both Stanford and
UC last weekend.
"We have no alternative under
the pact," Winbigler pointed out,
"but to report any violations or al
leged violations of the pact."
The plan—one of the most unusual
schemes ever conceived over the
years that UC students have at
tempted to upset the bonfire wood
pile—was described by police in this
manner:
Officer Robert Truesdell, patroling
along Foothill Road near the lake,
saw a parked car and the four stu
dents working in the center of the
lake.
The students fled when they spot
ted the officer approaching them and
left their car behind. Police im
pounded the car, and yesterday it
had reportedly been returned to the
student-owner.
However, Wesley Stuper, 23, sen
ior at UC, was apprehended on the
Stanford campus later.
Another student, who identified
himself as Kenneth L. Heikinen, 20,
was picked up by Palo Alto police
officer Anthony Poso on El Camino
Real when trying to hitch a ride to
Berkeley.
The two other students disap
peared.
Police found no explosives at the
scene of the woodpile, but Stuper,
who lives in Barrington Hail on
the UC Berkeley campus, told The
Daily yesterday that the group
planned to return before Nov. I!),


SAD SAM'S BIG MOMENT — Little Sam Tsagalakis has his
greatest moment as he boots Southern California to a 23-20 vic
tory over Stanford in the last 14 seconds of the game played in

Los Angeles Coliseum Saturday. Tsagalakis, a 157-lb. senior,
was kept on the Trojan sguad by Coach Jess Hill for the sole
purpose of kicking extra points and placements from the field.

He performed his job well. Too well, thougnt the scores of Stan
ford partisans who made up part of the huge throng of white
shirted viewers sweltering in the 90-degree heat. Quarterback

George Bozanic is holding the ball for Tsagalak j, as Indian line
men try futilely to block the dramatic placement.
