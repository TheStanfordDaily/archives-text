# Noisy Rally Keeps USC Team Awake
## 
### 
Stanford and USC football root
ers, bursting with excitement and
enthusiasm, staged a noisy, spirited
pre-game celebration in downtown
Los Angeles Friday night. It was a
celebration that ended up with:
1. A USC player conking a Stan
ford rooter on the head with an
apple.
2. A noisy parade of Stanford
rooters through the Town House
Hotel corridors which kept the USC
football team, which was quartered
there, awake.
3. And someone trying to throw
a "body" out of a second-floor room
of the hotel.
The story was pieced together by
witnesses who said the melee took
place when Stanford rooters staged
a rally in Lafayette Park across the
street from the Town House at 9
p.m.—the time when the USC team
was supposed to retire.
A Stanford student said some
members of the USC team started
throwing fruit out of the hotel win
dows and one Stanford man was hit
on the head with an apple.
An ambulance was called, al
though the victim required no
treatment.
Ed Crowley, manager of the Town
House, said he called police when
he heard "someone was trying to
throw someone out of a second-floor
window."
"Maybe it was a gag," Crowley
said. "They (the police) didn't find
anything."
