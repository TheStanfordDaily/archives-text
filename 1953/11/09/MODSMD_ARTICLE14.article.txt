### PETE GROTHE Sports Editor, The Daily 
LOS ANGELES COLISEUM, Nov. 7 — Defeat—defeat of llio
most torturous, dramatic, pain-wracking variety was the fate of the
game, fighting Stanfords on the floor of this embattled arena today.
USC's Tsagalakis, a hang-over from the two platoon system -
Sam Tsagalakis; a player who can't block, tackle, run, or pass,

but who CAN kick a ball through - *
two uprights, did just that today.
He did it with 13 seconds remain- I
ing in a game so exciting that 79,015 ;
I limp spectators were spraying I
chewed fingernails all over the Col- !
iseum. He did it from 38 yards out |
with the score tied 20 to 20.
And what he did stung the Indians
for a 23 to 20 defeat, the first they
have suffered in PCC play.
Not one of the 7f),015 could say
i that USC didn't deserve to win.
| And yet, it is just as true that no
j one could say that Stanford de
| served to lose.
Chuck Taylor's gang outgained the 1
j Trojans, 383 yards to 356. Also, the
j Trojans got by far the better breaks:
i (1) two Stanford fumbles recovered
by Troy; (2) a usually flawless Stan
j ford receiver dropping a touchdown ;
pass; (3) USC's Ron Miller inter
cepting a flat pass that set up the |
field goal. But the breaks were legit- j
imate, and no one could deny them j
to Jess Hill's team.
Stanford, besides having the sta- !
tistical edge, also had the player who |
dominated the game so completely j
that he cinched a spot on the All-
American team —Bob Garrett.
Garrett, whom Jess Hill described
I after the games as '"the best college
passer I have ever seen," shattered
the PCC passing yardage record, and ;
four other records. He threw 20 !
strikes in 31 attempts for 324 yards, i
breaking Jack Gebert's PCC mark
against Oregon last year. It's a be
lieve-it-or-not twist that Gebert
plays second string to the man who
broke his record.
Hut it didn't matter much that
Stanford outgained USC, that Troy
got the breaks, or that Garrett .was
the individual star. USC had the
t right figures where they count the
j most —on the scoreboard. Today's
.victory for hated Southern Cali
fornia was as great a moment for
I them as Stanford's 27 to 2ft tri-
I umph was for the '51 Indians.
And no one could deny it to them '
Bob Garrett's father, Mr. Joseph
Garrett, watched his son play for
the first time this year. He has a
cast for a broken hip that extends
from his hip to his foot, so he hasn't
been able to travel to see the Stan
ford games.
Mr. Garrett couldn't have picked a
| better day to see his son play. San
Marino Bobby, besides his PCC
mark, broke two USC all-opponent
records (most passes completed and
most yardage gained) and tied an
other (three touchdown passes |
against the Trojans). He also sur
passed the Stanford passing yardage
mark.
At one time, he completed 10 1
straight.
i But tficrc were others great in
defeat. Sam Morley played his
greatest pass-catching game. His
diving, grasping shoestring catch

in the end zone was the most
amazing reception we've ever seen.
And Steinberg was second only t«>
Morley.
The eenter of the Stanford line had
its best day. The Troy runners
could do comparatively little at thu
center of the line. The great Norm
Manoogian, the team leader, and
chunky Phil Wilson were tops, a,
were Ted Tanner and Jerry Gold
berg.
Marsh Howe was good in bloc-kin-•
and tackling, and Redondo Beach .
Ronnie Cook turned in one of the
sweetest runs of the year after a
Garrett screen pass.
Cook took the ball on the left side
lines, tight-rope walked the side -
lines, took precision advantage of
crunching blocks by Norm Manoog
ian and Ernie Dorn, cut to his light,
and went the entire 84 yards un
touched.
It was because of electrifying
performances like these that Stan
ford didn't deserve to lose. And
yet they did. They did utterly and
with devastating finality, as :i
player who only comes out foi
practice once or twice a week and
practices only place-kicking boot
ed the porker 38 yards between
the uprights with 1,1 seconds re
maining.
ft was not one of the least trag
edies of the game that Tsagalakis's
kick should get the headlines over
Garrett's brilliant performance.
A good thing came to a sad ending
on the? floor of this Coliseum today.
HOW THE SCORING WENT

in nine plays late in the first
quarter with Steinberg scoring on
a 15-yard pass play from Garrett.

LOS ANGELES COLISEUM, Nov. 7 — Defeat—defeat of llio
most torturous, dramatic, pain-wracking variety was the fate of the
game, fighting Stanfords on the floor of this embattled arena today.
USC's Tsagalakis, a hang-over from the two platoon system -
Sam Tsagalakis; a player who can't block, tackle, run, or pass,

but who CAN kick a ball through - *
two uprights, did just that today.
He did it with 13 seconds remain- I
ing in a game so exciting that 79,015 ;
I limp spectators were spraying I
chewed fingernails all over the Col- !
iseum. He did it from 38 yards out |
with the score tied 20 to 20.
And what he did stung the Indians
for a 23 to 20 defeat, the first they
have suffered in PCC play.
Not one of the 7f),015 could say
i that USC didn't deserve to win.
| And yet, it is just as true that no
j one could say that Stanford de
| served to lose.
Chuck Taylor's gang outgained the 1
j Trojans, 383 yards to 356. Also, the
j Trojans got by far the better breaks:
i (1) two Stanford fumbles recovered
by Troy; (2) a usually flawless Stan
j ford receiver dropping a touchdown ;
pass; (3) USC's Ron Miller inter
cepting a flat pass that set up the |
field goal. But the breaks were legit- j
imate, and no one could deny them j
to Jess Hill's team.
Stanford, besides having the sta- !
tistical edge, also had the player who |
dominated the game so completely j
that he cinched a spot on the All-
American team —Bob Garrett.
Garrett, whom Jess Hill described
I after the games as '"the best college
passer I have ever seen," shattered
the PCC passing yardage record, and ;
four other records. He threw 20 !
strikes in 31 attempts for 324 yards, i
breaking Jack Gebert's PCC mark
against Oregon last year. It's a be
lieve-it-or-not twist that Gebert
plays second string to the man who
broke his record.
Hut it didn't matter much that
Stanford outgained USC, that Troy
got the breaks, or that Garrett .was
the individual star. USC had the
t right figures where they count the
j most —on the scoreboard. Today's
.victory for hated Southern Cali
fornia was as great a moment for
I them as Stanford's 27 to 2ft tri-
I umph was for the '51 Indians.
And no one could deny it to them '
Bob Garrett's father, Mr. Joseph
Garrett, watched his son play for
the first time this year. He has a
cast for a broken hip that extends
from his hip to his foot, so he hasn't
been able to travel to see the Stan
ford games.
Mr. Garrett couldn't have picked a
| better day to see his son play. San
Marino Bobby, besides his PCC
mark, broke two USC all-opponent
records (most passes completed and
most yardage gained) and tied an
other (three touchdown passes |
against the Trojans). He also sur
passed the Stanford passing yardage
mark.
At one time, he completed 10 1
straight.
i But tficrc were others great in
defeat. Sam Morley played his
greatest pass-catching game. His
diving, grasping shoestring catch

in the end zone was the most
amazing reception we've ever seen.
And Steinberg was second only t«>
Morley.
The eenter of the Stanford line had
its best day. The Troy runners
could do comparatively little at thu
center of the line. The great Norm
Manoogian, the team leader, and
chunky Phil Wilson were tops, a,
were Ted Tanner and Jerry Gold
berg.
Marsh Howe was good in bloc-kin-•
and tackling, and Redondo Beach .
Ronnie Cook turned in one of the
sweetest runs of the year after a
Garrett screen pass.
Cook took the ball on the left side
lines, tight-rope walked the side -
lines, took precision advantage of
crunching blocks by Norm Manoog
ian and Ernie Dorn, cut to his light,
and went the entire 84 yards un
touched.
It was because of electrifying
performances like these that Stan
ford didn't deserve to lose. And
yet they did. They did utterly and
with devastating finality, as :i
player who only comes out foi
practice once or twice a week and
practices only place-kicking boot
ed the porker 38 yards between
the uprights with 1,1 seconds re
maining.
ft was not one of the least trag
edies of the game that Tsagalakis's
kick should get the headlines over

LOS ANGELES COLISEUM, Nov. 7 — Defeat—defeat of llio
most torturous, dramatic, pain-wracking variety was the fate of the
game, fighting Stanfords on the floor of this embattled arena today.
USC's Tsagalakis, a hang-over from the two platoon system -
Sam Tsagalakis; a player who can't block, tackle, run, or pass,

but who CAN kick a ball through - *
two uprights, did just that today.
He did it with 13 seconds remain- I
ing in a game so exciting that 79,015 ;
I limp spectators were spraying I
chewed fingernails all over the Col- !
iseum. He did it from 38 yards out |
with the score tied 20 to 20.
And what he did stung the Indians
for a 23 to 20 defeat, the first they
have suffered in PCC play.
Not one of the 7f),015 could say
i that USC didn't deserve to win.
| And yet, it is just as true that no
j one could say that Stanford de
| served to lose.
Chuck Taylor's gang outgained the 1
j Trojans, 383 yards to 356. Also, the
j Trojans got by far the better breaks:
i (1) two Stanford fumbles recovered
by Troy; (2) a usually flawless Stan
j ford receiver dropping a touchdown ;
pass; (3) USC's Ron Miller inter
cepting a flat pass that set up the |
field goal. But the breaks were legit- j
imate, and no one could deny them j
to Jess Hill's team.
Stanford, besides having the sta- !
tistical edge, also had the player who |
dominated the game so completely j
that he cinched a spot on the All-
American team —Bob Garrett.
Garrett, whom Jess Hill described
I after the games as '"the best college
passer I have ever seen," shattered
the PCC passing yardage record, and ;
four other records. He threw 20 !
strikes in 31 attempts for 324 yards, i
breaking Jack Gebert's PCC mark
against Oregon last year. It's a be
lieve-it-or-not twist that Gebert
plays second string to the man who
broke his record.
Hut it didn't matter much that
Stanford outgained USC, that Troy
got the breaks, or that Garrett .was
the individual star. USC had the
t right figures where they count the
j most —on the scoreboard. Today's
.victory for hated Southern Cali
fornia was as great a moment for
I them as Stanford's 27 to 2ft tri-
I umph was for the '51 Indians.

Bob Garrett's father, Mr. Joseph

| better day to see his son play. San
Marino Bobby, besides his PCC
mark, broke two USC all-opponent
records (most passes completed and
most yardage gained) and tied an
other (three touchdown passes |
against the Trojans). He also sur
passed the Stanford passing yardage
mark.
At one time, he completed 10 1
straight.
i But tficrc were others great in
defeat. Sam Morley played his
greatest pass-catching game. His
diving, grasping shoestring catch

in the end zone was the most
amazing reception we've ever seen.
And Steinberg was second only t«>
Morley.
The eenter of the Stanford line had
its best day. The Troy runners
could do comparatively little at thu
center of the line. The great Norm
Manoogian, the team leader, and
chunky Phil Wilson were tops, a,
were Ted Tanner and Jerry Gold
berg.
Marsh Howe was good in bloc-kin-•
and tackling, and Redondo Beach .
Ronnie Cook turned in one of the
sweetest runs of the year after a
Garrett screen pass.
Cook took the ball on the left side
lines, tight-rope walked the side -
lines, took precision advantage of
crunching blocks by Norm Manoog
