## For 'Constructive and Explicit' Criticism 
### 
To the Editor:
Mr. John Jumieson's criticism of "Lady Winder
mere's fan" was applauded by readers who object
to mellifluous reviews of student productions. I do
not believe that unmerited praise should be given a
play merely because it is a student production. I do
believe, however, that Mr. Jamieson should have
been more constructive and explicit in his Criticism
of the play. I feel a very definite lack of any criteria
in Mr. Jamieson's review. The reader is not told
whether the performance is being judged by profes
sional theatrical standards or by previous productions
of the Stanford Players. If the latter criterion is used,
much of what Mr. Jamieson says seems unwarranted.
Setting this aside, it still remains that a great portion
of liis criticism lacks precision and clarity.
What is meant when Mr. Jamieson writes that
(he final speech of Lord Augustus Lorton "goes over
well?" The meaning of the incongruous words
"deliriously affected" in describing the Duchess of

Berwick is doubtful. To say that "the sets and cos
tumes are truly excellent" without verification con
veys absolutely nothing to the reader. The flat
statement that the entire production is a failure
was unfortunate in the light of such poor evidence
and vague meaning.
It is regrettable that lucid criticism was not offered.
Perhaps the more intelligible portion of Mr. Jamie
son's review was deleted. Be that as it may, the play
deserved a more expressive and meaningful criticism
than it received.

(Editor's note: Miss Neff is correct in her guess
that explanatory portions of John Jamieson's re
view were edited. Due to lack of space and a press
ing deadline, about four inches of qualifying state
ments were deleted from the story. In fairness to
our reviewer, (he Daily points out that the review
did not appear as written in its entirety.)
