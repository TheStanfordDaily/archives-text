(This month the Free University of Berlin cele
brates its fifth anniversary. Hans Ilartenstein, who
studied for four years at the Free University and
was active in student government there, is now at

the students or each school elect representatives (one
for every 100 students, 00 all told) to the Konvent,
which is the legislature of the student body. This
Konvent then selects from its ranks an executive
committee, called the "ASTA," consisting of about ten
members. Besides the president, who is the official
representative of the student body as a whole, and
the vice president, there are so-called "Referenten"
in the ASTA, each of whom is in charge of a special
department. The most important are threo:
The Social Affairs Department. It administers
the distribution of scholarships and other means of
support for the students, most of whom are not
very well off.
The Foreign Affairs Department. It is in charge of
the foreign students at the Free University. It ar
ranges travels, publicizes job opportunities in coun
tries abroad, and engages in other activities similar
to those your lIR is doing.

During the last few weeks I have greatly enjoyed
witnessing the student life here at Stanford. Especi
ally impressing to me has been the fact that almost
every student takes part or shows interest in extra
curricular activities.
German universities do not stress this side of edu
cation. The main aim of our colleges is to train young
people in the methods of the scholar. Yet, this fact
does not mean that we have weak student govern
ments in Germany. It means that these governments
play a different role than they do in America.
The Free University "student self-government"
illustrates my point. In reality it is much more
than "self-government," for there is no question
concerning the university in which the students
do not have some voice.
This is due to the fact that in 1948 students
rather than professors took the initiative in establish
ing a new school which they called the "Free Uni
versity." They had found that academic freedom
could not survive under the Communist rule in the
old Berlin University which was located in the East
ern Sector. The new Free University was almost en-

tirely run by students during the
first months of its life. This has
changed now, but Berlin students
still have more influence upon
the whole university than stu
dents do at other German col
leges.
The Free University is divided
into five "Fakultaeten" or schools
(for Philosophy, Sciences, Law,
Economics, and Medicine). At
the end of the summer semester

Stanford on a scholarship sponsored by the Berlin
Affiliation Committee of the Institute of Interna
tional Relations. Below, he traces the short history
of the Free University, comparing its student gov
ernment with Stanford's.)

The All-German Affairs Department. It tackles
what is perhaps the most difficult and important prob
lem at the Free Universityâ€”that of helping the refu
gee students. More than a third of the student body
comes from the Soviet Zone without any chance of
getting support from their parents whom they left
behind, and they are hardly ever allowed to re-enter
the Eastern Zone.
There are also "Referenten" for cultural affairs,
publicity, athletics, and finances.
The work of the "ASTA" is controlled and di
rected by the "Konvent" which appropriates the
student budget, voices the opinion of the student
body towards important political and educational
questions, and establishes standing and temporary
committees for specific problems.
From its ranks the Konvent selects one repre
sentative of each school to be a member of the Fac
ulty Council of the scho<?l. It also appoints two stu
dents to membership in the "University Senate,"
which is the academic governing council of the Free
University, made up of the deans and a professor
from each school. The chairman of the Senate is the
rector, who would be the closest equivalent to an
American university president.
Thus, one can see that the students have a direct
say in deciding such questions as the appointment of
new faculty members, requirements for the various
degrees, changes in the constitution of the university,
what the relationship of the university to the city of
Berlin is to be (the city provides most of our money
and claims some influence, too).
These things arc not easy to solve satisfactorily.
Furthermore, there is the basic question whether
such strong student influence is beneficial in the
university administration. Opponents are to bp
found among tradition-conscious faculty members
as well as among apathetic students. The number
of uninterested students is very high even among
the 7!) per cent who usually vote in elections. It
is said that students are not qualified and never
should be allowed to take part in solving such com
plicated academic matters.
But in my opinion, the question is not whether stu
dents are as skilled in these things as the profes
sionals. for they certainly are not. The main point is
that German students must get over the feeling that
government is something separate from the people.
They need the experience of responsibility, which a
democracy demands.
In this respect, I am sure, our students could learn
quite a lot from the activity and the skill with which
American students run their affairs.
