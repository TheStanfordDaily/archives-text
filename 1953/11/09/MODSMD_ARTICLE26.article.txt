# Taylor: Cards Still in Bowl Race; Garrett, Receivers Praised by USC Mentor
## 
### PHIL BERMAN DON WEBSTER 
LOS ANGELES MEMORIAL
COLISEUM, Nov. 7 — USC
Coach Jess Hill, obviously re
lieved that his team had just
pulled out a three-point win in
the final seconds of play, put his
foot up on the trainers' table in
the shiny chromium and glass
dressing room here today and
said in revered tones:
"Bob Garrett is the greatest parser
I've ever seen."
"And his receivers Sain Morley
and John Steinberg," he continued
ii! awe, "why they're just terrific."
"'Stanford is a line foot hall team,
though," he stated. "And they're
the finest passing football team
I've seen in a long time." "Hut I
don't believe they hurt us run
ning." lie continued.
"You know," Ilill said, "when
Stanford had McColl. you only
had to defend against one man—
but TWO! And we had our best
pass defenders in there, but their
puss patterns were just too tough."
The Southland scribes were seem
ingly bored by all this tribute to

Stanford, however, and they pressed
Hill for comments about his Tro
jans.
"Why did you send Contratto into
the game along with Tsagalakis just
before the field goal and take a
five - yard penalty?" one of them
asked.
"I had to stop the clock, and had
to get our kicking unit into the
came," Hill replied, "but Sam (Tsa
galakis) just lold me that George
Bozanic did the holding. I figured
Bozanic was tired and might be a
little too nervous, so that's why I
.sent Contratto in too."
"Well, all I can say is that the
right fellow kicked," said Hill af
fably.
"You know,"he continued, "Sam
was the happiest boy on earth after
that field goal. He was crying at
half - time because he had missed
that second extra-point attempt."
Hill declined to comment on the
relative strength of Stanford and the
other PCC teams.
"1 don't think it's necessary to
compare Stanford and Oregon," he
stated. "After all. Oregon beat us.
I'll say Ibis, though. I've never
seen a passing exhibition like
Stanford showed today."'
Hill then put his loot down on the
floor and started out of the dressing
room when a short balding man
called after him saying:
"As a representative of the UCLA
Alumni Association, we thank you."
Jess turned around and a smile
crossed his usual taciturn counte
nance.
"Thanks," he said. "But don't
<-onnt on us (wo weeks from today."

LOS ANGELES MEMORIAL
COLISEUM, Nov. 7 — "We're
still in the Rose Bowl race."
Stanford Coacii Unuck Taylor,
after the 23-20 defeat of the Card
gridders in the Los Angeles Col
iseum Saturday, refused to ad
mit the Indians were eliminated
from the Pasadena competition.
"We have two games left," he
pointed out, "and we will do our
best to win them both. Next Satur
day we play San Jose State, and
then we face Cal in the Big One."
Taylor discussed trie phenomenal
rise of his club this season, calling
them "the most amazing bunch of
boys I have ever coached. And that
includes the Hose Bowl team of
1951."
"When \ve opened the season
against College of Pacific, we were
an altogether different team than
the one you saw today. Then our
defense was spotty and our offense
erratic. The club has come a very
long way since. We have seen a
consistent improvement, and 1 look
for two more great games this sea
son by our club."
The Stanford mentor had little
pessimism after the tilt. He said
the team had played a fine game
against an outstanding opponent.
When the football ,game reaches a
certain few crucial points, the
team cither comes through or it
doesn't.
"We didn't," he said.
The coach was asked to comment
on the passing ol quarterback Bob
Garrett. Did he think he passed too
much?
"I almost believe we didn't pass
enough," Taylor answered. Every
thing I have ever said about Gar
rett is true, lie gave us a line
performance on the field today,
and if it were not for him we
wouldn't have been in the game
at all."
When asked about the intercepted
pass the candidate for Ail-American
threw near the game's end, the
coach said he had no criticism to
make of Garrett. "Bob was rushed
hard all day, and he did an out
standing job. The Trojans have an
exceptional pass defense, but there is
no way to defend against Garrett's
type of passing."

then we face Cal in the Big One."
Taylor discussed trie phenomenal
rise of his club this season, calling
them "the most amazing bunch of
boys I have ever coached. And that
includes the Hose Bowl team of
1951."
"When \ve opened the season
against College of Pacific, we were
an altogether different team than
the one you saw today. Then our
defense was spotty and our offense
erratic. The club has come a very
long way since. We have seen a
consistent improvement, and 1 look
for two more great games this sea
son by our club."
The Stanford mentor had little
pessimism after the tilt. He said
the team had played a fine game
against an outstanding opponent.
When the football ,game reaches a
certain few crucial points, the
team cither comes through or it
doesn't.
"We didn't," he said.
The coach was asked to comment
on the passing ol quarterback Bob
Garrett. Did he think he passed too
much?
"I almost believe we didn't pass
enough," Taylor answered. Every
thing I have ever said about Gar
rett is true, lie gave us a line
performance on the field today,
and if it were not for him we
wouldn't have been in the game
at all."
When asked about the intercepted
pass the candidate for Ail-American
threw near the game's end, the
coach said he had no criticism to
make of Garrett. "Bob was rushed
hard all day, and he did an out
standing job. The Trojans have an
exceptional pass defense, but there is
no way to defend against Garrett's
type of passing."
LOS ANGELES MEMORIAL
COLISEUM, Nov. 7 — USC
Coach Jess Hill, obviously re
lieved that his team had just
pulled out a three-point win in
the final seconds of play, put his
foot up on the trainers' table in
the shiny chromium and glass
dressing room here today and
said in revered tones:
"Bob Garrett is the greatest parser
I've ever seen."
"And his receivers Sain Morley
and John Steinberg," he continued
ii! awe, "why they're just terrific."
"'Stanford is a line foot hall team,
though," he stated. "And they're
the finest passing football team
I've seen in a long time." "Hut I
don't believe they hurt us run
ning." lie continued.
"You know," Ilill said, "when
Stanford had McColl. you only
had to defend against one man—
but TWO! And we had our best
pass defenders in there, but their
puss patterns were just too tough."
The Southland scribes were seem
ingly bored by all this tribute to

Stanford, however, and they pressed
Hill for comments about his Tro
jans.
"Why did you send Contratto into
the game along with Tsagalakis just
before the field goal and take a
five - yard penalty?" one of them
asked.
"I had to stop the clock, and had
to get our kicking unit into the
came," Hill replied, "but Sam (Tsa
galakis) just lold me that George
Bozanic did the holding. I figured
Bozanic was tired and might be a
little too nervous, so that's why I
.sent Contratto in too."
"Well, all I can say is that the
right fellow kicked," said Hill af
fably.
"You know,"he continued, "Sam
was the happiest boy on earth after
that field goal. He was crying at
half - time because he had missed
that second extra-point attempt."
Hill declined to comment on the
relative strength of Stanford and the
other PCC teams.
"1 don't think it's necessary to
compare Stanford and Oregon," he
stated. "After all. Oregon beat us.
I'll say Ibis, though. I've never
seen a passing exhibition like
Stanford showed today."'
Hill then put his loot down on the
floor and started out of the dressing
room when a short balding man
called after him saying:
"As a representative of the UCLA
Alumni Association, we thank you."
Jess turned around and a smile
crossed his usual taciturn counte
nance.
"Thanks," he said. "But don't
<-onnt on us (wo weeks from today."

little too nervous, so that's why I
.sent Contratto in too."
"Well, all I can say is that the
right fellow kicked," said Hill af
fably.
"You know,"he continued, "Sam
was the happiest boy on earth after
that field goal. He was crying at
half - time because he had missed
that second extra-point attempt."
Hill declined to comment on the
relative strength of Stanford and the
other PCC teams.
"1 don't think it's necessary to
compare Stanford and Oregon," he
stated. "After all. Oregon beat us.
I'll say Ibis, though. I've never
seen a passing exhibition like
Stanford showed today."'
Hill then put his loot down on the
floor and started out of the dressing
room when a short balding man
called after him saying:
"As a representative of the UCLA
Alumni Association, we thank you."
Jess turned around and a smile
crossed his usual taciturn counte
nance.
"Thanks," he said. "But don't
<-onnt on us (wo weeks from today."

LOS ANGELES MEMORIAL
COLISEUM, Nov. 7 — "We're
still in the Rose Bowl race."
Stanford Coacii Unuck Taylor,
after the 23-20 defeat of the Card
gridders in the Los Angeles Col
iseum Saturday, refused to ad
mit the Indians were eliminated
from the Pasadena competition.
"We have two games left," he
pointed out, "and we will do our
best to win them both. Next Satur
day we play San Jose State, and
then we face Cal in the Big One."
Taylor discussed trie phenomenal
rise of his club this season, calling
them "the most amazing bunch of
boys I have ever coached. And that
includes the Hose Bowl team of
1951."
"When \ve opened the season
against College of Pacific, we were
an altogether different team than
the one you saw today. Then our
defense was spotty and our offense
erratic. The club has come a very
long way since. We have seen a
consistent improvement, and 1 look
for two more great games this sea
son by our club."
The Stanford mentor had little
pessimism after the tilt. He said
the team had played a fine game
against an outstanding opponent.
When the football ,game reaches a
certain few crucial points, the
team cither comes through or it
doesn't.
"We didn't," he said.
The coach was asked to comment
on the passing ol quarterback Bob
Garrett. Did he think he passed too
much?
"I almost believe we didn't pass
enough," Taylor answered. Every
thing I have ever said about Gar
rett is true, lie gave us a line
performance on the field today,
and if it were not for him we
wouldn't have been in the game
at all."
When asked about the intercepted
pass the candidate for Ail-American
threw near the game's end, the
coach said he had no criticism to
make of Garrett. "Bob was rushed
hard all day, and he did an out
standing job. The Trojans have an
exceptional pass defense, but there is
no way to defend against Garrett's
type of passing."
LOS ANGELES MEMORIAL
COLISEUM, Nov. 7 — USC
Coach Jess Hill, obviously re
lieved that his team had just
pulled out a three-point win in
the final seconds of play, put his
foot up on the trainers' table in
the shiny chromium and glass
dressing room here today and
said in revered tones:
"Bob Garrett is the greatest parser
I've ever seen."
"And his receivers Sain Morley
and John Steinberg," he continued
ii! awe, "why they're just terrific."
"'Stanford is a line foot hall team,
though," he stated. "And they're
the finest passing football team
I've seen in a long time." "Hut I
don't believe they hurt us run
ning." lie continued.
"You know," Ilill said, "when
Stanford had McColl. you only
had to defend against one man—
but TWO! And we had our best
pass defenders in there, but their
puss patterns were just too tough."
The Southland scribes were seem
ingly bored by all this tribute to

Stanford, however, and they pressed
Hill for comments about his Tro
jans.
"Why did you send Contratto into
the game along with Tsagalakis just
before the field goal and take a
five - yard penalty?" one of them
asked.
"I had to stop the clock, and had
to get our kicking unit into the
came," Hill replied, "but Sam (Tsa
galakis) just lold me that George
Bozanic did the holding. I figured
Bozanic was tired and might be a
little too nervous, so that's why I
.sent Contratto in too."
"Well, all I can say is that the
right fellow kicked," said Hill af
fably.
