# High School Students Learn Card Tricks for Experiment
## 
### 
Sixty Palo Alto and Redwood City
high school students have been go
ing to Stanford University to learn
card tricks in the interests of better
education.
The idea, explained Stanford psy
chologists who taught the card
tricks, was to find out whether a
student is as well off if he merely
memorizes his lessons instead of
learning by understanding them.
The answer, published in the lat
est issue of the Journal of Experi

mental Psychology, is yes—and no.
To begin with, it is harder and
takes longer to learn by under
standing. And no matter which
method of learning is employed—
understanding or rote memorization
—the students remembered equally
well on the next day.
On the other hand, the experi
ment indicated there is an advan
tage in understanding if the student
has to face new but similar prob
lems. Far more of the students who
understood the method could solve
subsequent card - trick problems
than students who only memorized
solutions to the first ones.
These results ai'e significant in
view of the fact that educational
methods today still rely too heavily
upon rote memorization, says Pro
fessor Ernest R. Hiigard, who di
rected the experiment under spon
sorship of the Office of Naval Re
search.
Dr. Hiigard, who is dean of the
Stanford graduate division and for
mer head of the Psychology Depart
ment, is co-author of the published
paper describing the experiment.
