## Shrieks, Smiles, Songs, Yells; Then Groans of Disbelief In Coliseum 
### RAY LOYND 
MEMORIAL COLISEUM, Nov. 7
— "If you lose your voice —
SCREAM!"
R was yell leader Howie Rubin
shrieking at the tense Stanford
rooters late in the fourth quarter.
And over 3,000 frantic Cardinals
roared themselves hoarse as wildly
swinging arms, pom - poms, and
megaphones followed the Big Red's
final try at the kill.
Then the pass, the interception,
the field goal . . . silence, bedlam.
And termination to the most color
ful spectacle in Los Angeles this
year.
Fans called the game a classic
and as Stanford warbled its post
game "Alma Mater" a few out
siders cried, "The goal posts!" but
the instrument of defeat held no
attraction for the stunned Indians.
While Stanford students filed out
of the Coliseum, one ashen-blonde
stopped and uncontrollably allowed
her disappointment to break out. A
police officer came to her aid and
reassuringly calmed down the In
dian die-hard.
After Garrett hit Steinberg for the
Cards' 'first touchdown, a pair of
Trojan gladiators, trimmed in war
rior helmets, breast plates, and shin
guards, marched immediately over
to the Stanford rooting section and
defiantly shook their swords in the
Cards' faces, then hurriedly turned
around and scuttled into the west
end tunnel.
The two outstanding Card hijinks
were the' "Flush the Troylets" pre
game rooting section sign and a
sharp directive to the Trojan legend,
an ingenious half-time card stunt
flashing "To Helen with Troy."
The red and white rooters un
der the press box seemed to be
ringed by boosters of the red and
gold and each time SC had cause
to cheer the body of white shirts
groaned while its borders leaped
with joy.
One of these border outposts was
so anti-SC, hqwevcr, that he con
tinually bombarded the Stanfordites
with loud, coarse bursts of "Twist
his leg! Twist it more! Oregon did
it, you can do it!" in regard to doc
toring up the dangerous, euphoni
ous - ringing Frenchman, Aramis
Dandoy.
