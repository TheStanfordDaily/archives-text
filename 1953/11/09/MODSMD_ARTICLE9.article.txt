"Sad Sam Tsagalakis."
They muttered it as an oath or
merely stated it as a fact. But the
result was the same. Here on cam
pus they couldn't believe it. Only
two minutes earlier the announcer
had said Stanford had the ball on
the SC 20-yard line, and now . . .
It just couldn't be true.
Out at Rossotti's the large crowd
was quiet. Throughout the game
they had yelled and stomped when
ever Stanford made a touchdown or
Garrett clicked with another pass,
but everyone had been too intent on
hearing the game to make too much
noise.
Then came those last 20 seconds.
And there was nothing left to do but
order another round. And wait for
Cal.
Toyon was deep in gloom. At
one point during the game one
group had started the chant
"We're going to the Rose Bowl,

Boys in another wing picked it up,
and for a few minutes all was
cheerful and noisy.
Then came those last 20 seconds.

were blaring, Rose Bowl hopes soar

Then came those Tast 20 seconds.
"I just can't believe it." '"Damn,
but Garrett played f a great game."
And, "This will really make the
Big Game big."
We'd just better beat Cal. That
seemed to sum it all up. It was the
only comeback thay had just then.
