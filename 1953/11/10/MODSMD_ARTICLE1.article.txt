### 
The raids on the campus early Saturday morning that saw blue
"Cal's" and "C's" painted on several prominent structures and
walkways were definitely made by University of California stu
dents, Police Chief Gordon Davis reported yesterday.
A report of this raid and of an attempt to sabotage the bonfire

the same morning was forwarded
yesterday to Dean of Students Ilur
ford E. Stone at Cal by Dean H.
Donald Winbigler. The eomplaint
was made in accordance with the
terms of the non - aggression pact ;
signed this weekend by student of- j
ficials of the rival institutions.
Stanford Police Oflicer George
Lester, on duty at Encina, was the
lirst on campus to spot the paint
raiders when he saw a car quick
ly pulling away from the front of
the dormitory where paint had
been smeared. The license num
ber of the car was traced, and the
vehicle was said to belong to
Gregg J. Figgins, a Cal student.
According to Davis, it is up to
Berkeley authorities to find out
who was in the car and to take
steps to reprimand those involved.
According to Davis, the raids were
staged by two groups of students
acting independently. "They both
came early in the year to avoid de
tection by the freshman guard. The
students involved apparently ig
nored the fact that the campus is
patrolled all year long by the Po
lice Department," he said.
Cases reported to California are
referred to the Student Judicial
Committee, a group similar to the
Stanford Men's and Women's
Councils, According to the pact,
punishment may range from sim
ple payment of damages to sus
suspension from school.
The sabotage-try on the bonfire
was foiled by Stanford Police Ofli
cer Robert Truesdell, who noticed a
ear parked at Lake Lagunita early
Saturday morning and came upon
some students laying an electric
wire across the lake bed.
According to the chief, the raid
ers were apparently not sure of
where the fire was to be laid. They
were planning to return later where
the fire foundations had been fixed
and send a charge through the wire,
starting a small fire. The possibility
of dynamite being used was ruled
out by Davis.
The painting was done on the
sandstone towers in front of the
Quad, the corner of the Education
Building, the sidewalk in front of
the Bookstore, and the walkway at
Encina.
