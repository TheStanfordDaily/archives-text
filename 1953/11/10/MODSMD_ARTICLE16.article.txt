LOS ANGELES, Nov. 9 (UP)
The political attention of the na
tion tonight was focused on Califor
nia's 24th Congressional District
where tomorrow two Republicans
and two Democrats will contest for
the seat vacated by Mayor Norris
Poulson.
The "sudden death" election had
the Republican party worried over
the possibility that it may result in
cutting the GOP's margin in the
House of Representatives to two,
218 to 216.
While there arc two candidates
from each party, the lesser of the
Democratic candidates was given
little chance. But in the Republican
ranks both candidates were strongly
backed, making it possible for the
leading Democratic candidate,
George L. Arnold, to "divide and
conquer."
The Republican rivals arc Glenard
P. Lipscomb, 38, and John L. E. Col
lier. Both arc State Assemblymen
and both are prominent in the dis
trict. Lipscomb was the "official"
party candidate.
Efforts of administration and par
ty stalwarts to get Collier either to
withdraw or throw his support to
Lipscomb were unsuccessful.
Arnold, 32-year-old attorney, is
the son of former trust - buster
Thurman Arnold. He is the son-in
law of columnist Drew Pearson.
The fourth candidate is Irving
Markhcim, 45, a Veterans' Service
official and defeated candidate sev
eral times before agaiast Poulson,
who resigned last May following his
election as mayor.
