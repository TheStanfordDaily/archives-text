# Let's Live Up to the Pact
## 
### 
No sooner had the signatures been affixed to
the 1953 version of the Big Game non-aggres
sion pact between the University of California
and Stanford than an alleged violation of the
pact took place here on the campus over the
weekend.
The alleged violation involved an ingenious
attempt by Cal students to upset the Big Game
bonfire pyre on Lake Lagunita. The Daily does
not condone this type of prank as an example
of lively school spirit, if that was what it was
intended to exemplify. The whole plot seemed
to us to be potentially dangerous, since it ulti
mately involved the use of an incendiary ex
plosive.
Furthermore, The Daily believes that this is
cleaily a violation of the non-aggression pact,
a view apparently shared by Stanford officials
who have reported the incident.
Whether or not the Cal students who partici
pated in the alleged violation will be subject to
"severe discipline," as specified in the pact, is

a matter for the Cal authorities to decide, how
ever. It is our contention that the Cal authori
ties have no alternative but to subject the stu
dents to some disciplinary measures because
to let this matter slip by this time could set a
precedent that will be hard to reverse should
there be any similar violations.
The non-aggression pact clearly states that
each student body will undertake to educate
its members in the weeks preceding the Big
Game to "observe the spirit of this resolution
and to exercise every possible measure to pre
vent any incident that may lead to its violation.
We hope Stanford students have carefully
read the complete text of the pact as published
in yesterday's Daily and that, furthermore, they
will abandon any prospective plans for retalia
tion at Cal.
There is, it seems to us, enough work to be
done to foster spirit for the Big Game right here
without wasting energies on pranks. '
