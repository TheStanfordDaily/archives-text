# CAMPUS OPINION
## Defends Excom's Decision on Elections 
### 
To the Editor:
The Executive Committee did not, by its action
in approving Senior Class Representative election
last Wednesday, and does not now condone irregular
or careless conduct of student elections. Neither did
it, nor will it violate the Constitution, which may be
adopted or altered only by student referendum and
may be interpreted only by the Dean of the Law
School.
The constitution and, more particularly, the by
laws are badly in need of revision since they are
ambiguous, incomplete, and are ill calculated, be
cause of confusing language, to guide student leaders
or candidates in the proper execution of their duties.
As a result of this confusion last spring, and because
no decisions or interpretations were rendered prior
to that election, several elections had to be voided
and many candidates were adversely affected.
The b> -laws, wherein the procedural rules for
conduct of elections are found, may be amended by
the executive committee and interpreted by the
ASSU president in order to prevent confusion. It
was thought best to make all decisions and in
terpretations on the election procedural rules be
fore the primary election hist week, rather than
afterwards, as had besn done in the past. Interpre
tation was rendered in accordance with the by-laws
on the Thursday prior to the election, and notice
thereof was printed in The Daily on Friday, but
only after consultation with the candidates, who
unanimously approved.
Procedural rules for the conduct of elections are

not so hallowed as to be unalterable except by going
through the time consuming channels, especially
when a more expeditious method is available. Pro
cedural rules are not an end in and of themselves,
but a means to an end, which, in this instance, is a
fair provision of equal opportunity for each candi
date and reasonable notice to each elector. .
On the facts set out above, the majority of the
executive committee believed that both provisions
had been fairly satisfied.
No one has contended, either before or since the
election, that any elector or candidate was prejudiced
by the procedural rule interpretation. Those who
opposed approval of the results, purported to do so
only on the ground that there had been a failure of
literal compliance with one of the procedural rules for
the conduct of elections as set out in the by-laws.
If timely objection is raised, it must and would be
recognized, but since there was proper notification
of procedure and no objection was voiced, a late
objection is untenable as prejudicial to the winning
candidate.
The executive committee will present to the stu
dents in a special election during winter quarter an
opportunity to adopt a revised constitution, and a new
set of by-laws will be adopted. Particular attention
will be given to rules governing the conduct of elec
tions in an effort to alleviate the problems which
have arisen altogether too frequently in recent elec
tions.
