# Posinâ€”Soviet Power Waning

"If the Soviet Empire is not crum
bling, it certainly shows definite
signs of tottering," declared Pro
fessor Jack A. Posin yesterday in j
his talk to the Faculty Women's
Club.
Speaking to an audience of about j
150 women in Bowman Alumni
House, Posin cited recent purge
trials in the Soviet Empire as evi
dence of signs of insecurity and un
certainty.
Because of this insecurity, the
Russians would in all probability
not take any drastic steps toward a
third World War.
The two most important elements
of worry in Russia are comparison
with the democratic states and the
resentment of their satellites, the
Russian expert said.
Posin indicated that since most
of the satellites, particularly .
Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hun
gary, feel that they are culturally I
and intellectually superior to the ;
Russians, they bitterly resent be
ing ruled by them.
Also, he said, the constant com- |
parison being made by satellite peo- ;
[iles with the Western democracies,
which shows up most clearly in East 1
Germany, is definitely harmful to
Communist prestige.
In conclusion, Posin said that the
two things that America must do if
it intends to win the Cold War are
to keep our state strong and keep
our democracy intact.
"One thought that we must keep
in mind," he said, "is the old saying
'Only the strong are free, but also
only free are strong'."
