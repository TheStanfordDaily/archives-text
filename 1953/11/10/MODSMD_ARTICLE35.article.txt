# Indians Cinch PCC Water Polo Crown
## 
### DON STEPHENS 
Stanford's 1953 water polo team, regarded by Coach Tom Hay
nie as the best in the school's modern history, won the Southern
Division Pacific Coast Conference championship last weekend,
as they rolled to a double win over UCLA and USC in the south.
With one game remaining for each of the four conference

schools, Stanford has a live win, no'
loss record, followed by California
with three and two, and UCLA and
USC each with one win, four loss
records.
The Indians close out their nine
game season Saturday in the Encina
Pools, when they will host a very
good Cal team. The Bears' two
losses this season have been by
slender one-goal margins to USC
and the Cards.
Haynie's ball club beat the Bru
ins 12 to 4 Friday afternoon and
outslugged USC (> to 2 Saturday
morning.
The UCLA game was an easy
victory for the Cards, as they led
7 to 0 at half-time thanks to the
tremendous defensive play of
guards John Sell mitt, l'ritz Kun
y.el. Wall\ Parks, and Carver Nix
on and goalie Dave Murlon.
The Bruins' Bob Zerkie broke
through the defensive wall in the
third and fourth quarters for three
goals, but by then the damage was
done.
The scoring was almost equally
divided between Stanford's three
forwards, with Jim Gaughran and
Irwin Johnson accounting for four
goals each and Jim Lee tanking
three. Boh Kerglund put in one
of his sweeping scoop -.hots in the
third quarter for the other Indian
score.
Stanford was not to have an easy
time of it for two days in a row,
however, for the game with the Tro
jans was the roughest that a Hay
nie-coached team has been involved
in in the last few years.
While the rest of the teams in the
league generally abide by the rules
against excessive contact in water
polo, USC has its own "house rules"
permitting anything short of may
hem. The Trojans didn't figure that
rough play could go both ways,
though, and Coach Dick Kolhase's
starting seven were a bruised lot
when they climbed out of the pool
after the final gun.
Once a#ain it was Johnny
Schmitt, playing the game of his
life, who anchored the defense.
Schmitt, a senior from Whittier,
not only held his man scoreless,,
but with his all-around play and
heads - up switching greatly
strengthened his claim to an All-
Conference guard post.
The scoring was evenly distrib
uted between Haynie's three offen
sive gunners, with Gaughran, Lee,
and Johnson each getting two goals.
Also coming in for a share of the

►
praise was senior goalie Dave Mur
ton. Murton was a demon in the
cage, stopping both of the southern
teams cold in the first halves of the

two games. And it was luck and a
bit of sloppy defensive play, rather
than any failing of Dave's, that en-

ablecl the Bruins and Trojans to
score at all.
This Saturday's game with Cal
will start at 11, with the freshmen
of the two schools playing a pre
liminary at 10.

Once a#ain it was Johnny
Schmitt, playing the game of his

Schmitt, a senior from Whittier,
not only held his man scoreless,,

strengthened his claim to an All-
Conference guard post.
The scoring was evenly distrib
uted between Haynie's three offen
sive gunners, with Gaughran, Lee,
and Johnson each getting two goals.
Also coming in for a share of the

praise was senior goalie Dave Mur
ton. Murton was a demon in the
cage, stopping both of the southern
teams cold in the first halves of the

two games. And it was luck and a
bit of sloppy defensive play, rather
than any failing of Dave's, that en-

ablecl the Bruins and Trojans to
score at all.

this 32 yarder from Bob Garrett. Morley caught eight passes

Stanford's 1953 water polo team, regarded by Coach Tom Hay
nie as the best in the school's modern history, won the Southern
Division Pacific Coast Conference championship last weekend,
as they rolled to a double win over UCLA and USC in the south.
With one game remaining for each of the four conference

schools, Stanford has a live win, no'
loss record, followed by California
with three and two, and UCLA and
USC each with one win, four loss
records.
The Indians close out their nine
game season Saturday in the Encina
Pools, when they will host a very
good Cal team. The Bears' two
losses this season have been by
slender one-goal margins to USC
and the Cards.
Haynie's ball club beat the Bru
ins 12 to 4 Friday afternoon and
outslugged USC (> to 2 Saturday
morning.
The UCLA game was an easy
victory for the Cards, as they led
7 to 0 at half-time thanks to the
tremendous defensive play of
guards John Sell mitt, l'ritz Kun
y.el. Wall\ Parks, and Carver Nix
on and goalie Dave Murlon.
The Bruins' Bob Zerkie broke
through the defensive wall in the
third and fourth quarters for three
goals, but by then the damage was
done.
The scoring was almost equally
divided between Stanford's three
forwards, with Jim Gaughran and
Irwin Johnson accounting for four
goals each and Jim Lee tanking
three. Boh Kerglund put in one
of his sweeping scoop -.hots in the
third quarter for the other Indian
score.
Stanford was not to have an easy
time of it for two days in a row,
however, for the game with the Tro
jans was the roughest that a Hay
nie-coached team has been involved
in in the last few years.
While the rest of the teams in the
league generally abide by the rules
against excessive contact in water
polo, USC has its own "house rules"
permitting anything short of may
hem. The Trojans didn't figure that
rough play could go both ways,
though, and Coach Dick Kolhase's
starting seven were a bruised lot
when they climbed out of the pool
after the final gun.
