# Jan Peerce Wins Praise Of Reviewer
## 
### BARNEY CHILDS 
Jan Peerce sang a program
last night that the South Milpi
ias Women's Fortnightly Musi
cale would have gone for like |
crazy. Unfortunately the capaci- j
ly house at Memorial Auditori
um, made up for the most part
of citizens of greater Palo Alto,
wont for it like crazy too.
Mr. Peerce's voiec deserves better
music than last night's fare. He has j
an case of delivery and a surcncss of j
control that is the sign of the ma- j
ture artist; his voiec is not an heroic j
tenor, but possess a clarity and
strength that obviates shouting in
upper register fortissimos.
lie is a line operatic tenor, per- j
haps the best on the Coast, and
his nmst successful selections last
night were arias from operas, par
ticularly the familiar "La flcur
que (u m'avais jetce," from Car
men. He manages the problems ;
of an aria with precision, never j
seeming to be in anything but j
complete control of volume, inton- j
ation, and delivery, and he sings !
easily, without the writhing and
liistronics alTcctcd by. lesser artists j
to cover up vocal deficiencies.
Somehow Italian opera creeps into I
everything Mr. Peerce sings; I found ;
his two Schubert lipder a trifle too
musclehound, but some of this may
have been due to an uncertain rap
port between piano and vocalist.
In the customary virtuoso display
provided by not one but two Handel j
arias, Mr. Peerce was convincing, j
Above practically all else he man- !
ages to sound like a singer, even in i
the Rossini and "Gypsf Baron" en
cores. where the tobacco auctioneer j
is apt to prevail with smaller talents. J
The programming, aside from the I
arias, was bad, and grew worse. Sev- i
eral songs by Osma and Palndilhe
proved a string of Hispanic cliches j
as passionless as a pool table, Samuel I
' Barber turned out to be the poor j
man's Carrie Jacobs Bond as a song !
writer, and even Roger Quilter's
threadbare "Blow, blow, thou winter '
! wind," stood out of the mishmash. !
No matter how shoddy the mu
si", however, iMr. Peerce still sang
well, doing everything he could
with what the music provided.
Accompanist Alexander Alexay
presented three piano solos after the
; intermission, managing to prove (a)
transcriptions of Bach with every
voice doubled in octaves sound
really nasty; (b) discreet and fran
tic pedaling and the customary
squirming at the piano arc almost
I sufficient to cover up technical blun
ders; and (c) the more forcibly one
depresses the keys of a piano, the
jollier a noise is apt to result. Mr.
Alexay played an encore by one
K rede I ie Chopin, a composer known,
according lo a sot to voce whisper
near me in the balcony, as the Poet
of the Piano.
A .m accompanist Mr. Alexay
fared somewhat better, although
theic were occasional jugglings of
tempo between singer and piano.
Tin best accompanists are heard
and not seen: the audience is, or
should he. undistractcd by movings
about at the piano.
I hope the ASSU will be able to
obtain Mr. Peerce again; I am will
inu to listen to him sing anything
any time, even if the programming
committee selects excerpts from
"Bohemian Girl" and maybe even
I Malottc's "The Lord's Prayer."
