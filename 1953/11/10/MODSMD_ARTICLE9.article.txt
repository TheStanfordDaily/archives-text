### BARBARA TUERK 
Bearing resolutions approving
everything from campus anti
racial discrimination campaigns
to an alumni "Friends od the
Association" organization, Stan
ford's National Students Associ
ation delegation returned to
campus Sunday night from a
two-day regional NSA conven
tion held at UCLA last weekend.
Bccau.sc of what delegation head
Don Lozabniek called "prior com
mittments" the majority of the Stan
ford delegation had to skip Satur
day afternoon's discussion work
shops and base their impression of
the convention on the Saturday and
Sunday morning plenary sessions.
Lozabniek expressed disappoint
ment yesterday that the Stanford
delegation had had to miss the work
shops which he felt were the most

valuable part of the conference, but
said, "We recognize the potential
value of working with other schools,
and realize the great possibilities of
improvement for future efforts in
this region."
The conference defeated, 11 to
11, after lengthy debate the only
resolution proposed by Stanford's
delegation—a resolution by Execu
tive Committee delegate Bob Mi
shell that the California-Nevada-
Hawaii Region of NSA sponsor a
' change in the national constitution
; so that schools might join the re
gional organization of NSA with
; out joining the national.
Delegates who voted against Stan
ford's resolution felt that the real
| value in NSA comes from its na
, tional character.
In speaking against Stanford's res
olution, Jim Edwards, University of
Illinois, national president of NSA,
suggested that schools who could
not afford to go back to national con
i ventions would not need to do so.

He .said that national duob arc so
low that any school can easily afford
them.
Mishell and Lozabniek stressed the
need to build up strong regional or
ganizations first, before the national
organization could hope for strength. :
Resolutions concerning racial dis
crimination occupied a considerable
part of the plenary session's time
Sunday morning.
A recommendation that the NSA
national policy stand against ra
cial discrimination be brought be
fore each student government for
action and possible implementation
was passed by a narrow margin,
Stanford's delegation splitting
three to two against it.
Public Relations Committee dele
gate A1 Ivey and Mishell voted
"Yes." Lozabniek, ASSU Vice Presi
dent Jean Bobis, and Student Man
ager John Stahr voted "No," on
grounds that the motion could do
j no practical good at the present
time.

The conference approved, 20 to 2,
a resolution which came from the
Editors Workshop which said, "We
resolve that editorial board positions
on student newspapers should be
open to any student, the only cri
teria being journalistic experience
and competence."
Opposition to the resolution was
based on a belief that a student who j
insisted on a viewpoint directly con- j
trary to that of the student body :
should not be eligible for editorial ,
posts.
Students defending the motion 1
stressed the fact that a competent
journalist would realize his respon
sibility to the students in his uni- j
versity.
The resolution also states: "In
accord with the responsibility del
egated to the student newspaper
by the student body, we resolve
that student newspapers have the
obligation and the right to exer
cise freedom of editorial expres
sion and decision."

The conference passed easily i
second resolution growing out of
workshop discussions — a resolution
from the student government v/oik
shop that "student government,
should do its utmost to provide th<-
means for student discussion upon
any issue of interest to students "
Sunday morning's plenary session
opened with a summary of the tli -
cussions held in Saturday afternoon
workshops.
The reports:
1. The Student Government Work •
shop. This group centered i'
attention on the functions of studwnt.
government and the problem of stu
dent apathy.
Its most heated debate centered
around the function of providing
voice for student opinion. Students
were split on whether the elected
; student government does or does
not have the right to express student
j opinion on political issues.
2. The Editors Workshop. The edi-
tors discussed typography and lay
out, and the do's and don'ts of good
journalistic writing. They named as
criteria for selecting and placing
stories the editor's personal judg
ment, the ethics of journalism, and
student interest.
The International AlTairs Work
shop. Students at this discussion
enumerated the goals ol a success
ful campus international program,
and suggested ways to work toward
implementing these goals.
4. Regional Business. In this work
shop campus coordinators from NSA
member schools dj* :ussed the re
gional projects now under way.

Bearing resolutions approving
everything from campus anti
racial discrimination campaigns
to an alumni "Friends od the
Association" organization, Stan
ford's National Students Associ
ation delegation returned to
campus Sunday night from a
two-day regional NSA conven
tion held at UCLA last weekend.
Bccau.sc of what delegation head
Don Lozabniek called "prior com
mittments" the majority of the Stan
ford delegation had to skip Satur
day afternoon's discussion work
shops and base their impression of
the convention on the Saturday and
Sunday morning plenary sessions.
Lozabniek expressed disappoint
ment yesterday that the Stanford
delegation had had to miss the work
shops which he felt were the most

valuable part of the conference, but
said, "We recognize the potential
value of working with other schools,
and realize the great possibilities of
improvement for future efforts in
this region."
The conference defeated, 11 to
11, after lengthy debate the only
resolution proposed by Stanford's
delegation—a resolution by Execu
tive Committee delegate Bob Mi
shell that the California-Nevada-
Hawaii Region of NSA sponsor a
' change in the national constitution
; so that schools might join the re
gional organization of NSA with
; out joining the national.
Delegates who voted against Stan
ford's resolution felt that the real
| value in NSA comes from its na
, tional character.
In speaking against Stanford's res
olution, Jim Edwards, University of
Illinois, national president of NSA,
suggested that schools who could
not afford to go back to national con
i ventions would not need to do so.

He .said that national duob arc so
low that any school can easily afford
them.
Mishell and Lozabniek stressed the
need to build up strong regional or
ganizations first, before the national
organization could hope for strength. :
Resolutions concerning racial dis
crimination occupied a considerable
part of the plenary session's time
Sunday morning.
A recommendation that the NSA
national policy stand against ra
cial discrimination be brought be
fore each student government for
action and possible implementation
was passed by a narrow margin,
Stanford's delegation splitting
three to two against it.
Public Relations Committee dele
gate A1 Ivey and Mishell voted
"Yes." Lozabniek, ASSU Vice Presi
dent Jean Bobis, and Student Man
ager John Stahr voted "No," on
grounds that the motion could do
j no practical good at the present
time.

The conference approved, 20 to 2,
a resolution which came from the
Editors Workshop which said, "We
resolve that editorial board positions
on student newspapers should be
open to any student, the only cri
teria being journalistic experience
and competence."
Opposition to the resolution was
based on a belief that a student who j
insisted on a viewpoint directly con- j
trary to that of the student body :
should not be eligible for editorial ,
posts.
Students defending the motion 1
stressed the fact that a competent
journalist would realize his respon
sibility to the students in his uni- j
versity.
The resolution also states: "In
accord with the responsibility del
egated to the student newspaper
by the student body, we resolve
that student newspapers have the
obligation and the right to exer
cise freedom of editorial expres
sion and decision."

should not be eligible for editorial ,
posts.
Students defending the motion 1
stressed the fact that a competent
journalist would realize his respon
sibility to the students in his uni- j
versity.
The resolution also states: "In
accord with the responsibility del
egated to the student newspaper
by the student body, we resolve
that student newspapers have the
obligation and the right to exer

sion and decision."

The conference passed easily i
second resolution growing out of
workshop discussions — a resolution
from the student government v/oik

should do its utmost to provide th<-
means for student discussion upon
any issue of interest to students "
Sunday morning's plenary session
opened with a summary of the tli -
cussions held in Saturday afternoon
workshops.
The reports:
1. The Student Government Work •
shop. This group centered i'
attention on the functions of studwnt.
government and the problem of stu
dent apathy.
Its most heated debate centered
around the function of providing
voice for student opinion. Students
were split on whether the elected
; student government does or does
not have the right to express student
j opinion on political issues.
2. The Editors Workshop. The edi-
tors discussed typography and lay
out, and the do's and don'ts of good
journalistic writing. They named as
criteria for selecting and placing
stories the editor's personal judg
ment, the ethics of journalism, and
student interest.
The International AlTairs Work
shop. Students at this discussion
enumerated the goals ol a success
ful campus international program,
and suggested ways to work toward
implementing these goals.
4. Regional Business. In this work
shop campus coordinators from NSA
member schools dj* :ussed the re
gional projects now under way.
Bearing resolutions approving
everything from campus anti
racial discrimination campaigns
to an alumni "Friends od the
Association" organization, Stan
ford's National Students Associ
ation delegation returned to
campus Sunday night from a
two-day regional NSA conven
tion held at UCLA last weekend.
Bccau.sc of what delegation head
Don Lozabniek called "prior com
mittments" the majority of the Stan
ford delegation had to skip Satur
day afternoon's discussion work
shops and base their impression of
the convention on the Saturday and
Sunday morning plenary sessions.
Lozabniek expressed disappoint
ment yesterday that the Stanford
delegation had had to miss the work
shops which he felt were the most

valuable part of the conference, but
said, "We recognize the potential
value of working with other schools,
and realize the great possibilities of
improvement for future efforts in
this region."
The conference defeated, 11 to
11, after lengthy debate the only
resolution proposed by Stanford's
delegation—a resolution by Execu
tive Committee delegate Bob Mi
shell that the California-Nevada-
Hawaii Region of NSA sponsor a
' change in the national constitution
; so that schools might join the re
gional organization of NSA with
; out joining the national.
Delegates who voted against Stan
ford's resolution felt that the real
| value in NSA comes from its na
, tional character.
In speaking against Stanford's res
olution, Jim Edwards, University of
Illinois, national president of NSA,
suggested that schools who could
not afford to go back to national con
i ventions would not need to do so.

He .said that national duob arc so
low that any school can easily afford
them.
Mishell and Lozabniek stressed the
need to build up strong regional or
ganizations first, before the national
organization could hope for strength. :
Resolutions concerning racial dis
crimination occupied a considerable
part of the plenary session's time
Sunday morning.
A recommendation that the NSA
national policy stand against ra
cial discrimination be brought be
fore each student government for
action and possible implementation
was passed by a narrow margin,
Stanford's delegation splitting
three to two against it.
Public Relations Committee dele
gate A1 Ivey and Mishell voted
"Yes." Lozabniek, ASSU Vice Presi
dent Jean Bobis, and Student Man
ager John Stahr voted "No," on
grounds that the motion could do
j no practical good at the present
time.

The conference approved, 20 to 2,
a resolution which came from the
Editors Workshop which said, "We
resolve that editorial board positions
on student newspapers should be
open to any student, the only cri
teria being journalistic experience
and competence."
Opposition to the resolution was
based on a belief that a student who j
insisted on a viewpoint directly con- j
trary to that of the student body :
should not be eligible for editorial ,
posts.
