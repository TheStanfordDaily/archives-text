## Big Three Arrange December Meeting 
### 
WASHINGTON, rtovr. 10 (UP) —
President Eisenhower will meet
British Prime Minister Winston
Churchill and French Premier Jo
seph Laniel in Bermuda Dec. 4-8
to map Western strategy toward
Russia's new "get tough" attitude.
Formal announcement of the top
level meeting was made today by
the White House here and by
Churchill in London.
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles, British Foreign Secretary
Anthony Eden, and French For
eign Minister Georges Bidauit
will accompany the "Big Three"
to the four-day confcrcncc at the
sunny British vacation isle in the
Atlantic.
Mr. Eisenhower and Churchill
are expectcd to fly to Bermuda.
Plans to hold the postponed meet
ing now resulted directly from Rus
sia's recent note completely evad
ing a Western proposal for a con
ference to settle the future of Ger
many and Austria.
High on the agenda is expected
to he a plea by Churchill for a
"last chance" meeting with Soviet
Premier Gcorgi Malenkov in an
effort to ease East-West tension.
Mr. Eisenhower and the State
Department still are opposed to
such a meeting without concrete
evidence that Russia really wants to
settle differences with the West—
evidence they feel is totally lacking
thus far.
