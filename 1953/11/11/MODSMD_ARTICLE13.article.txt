## 
### 
The big hunt for the missing
Stanford Axe moved into its sixth
month this week with less than two
weeks to go before it is needed for
; presentation at the annual Bits
| Game Nov. 21 between the Univer
| sity of California and Stanford.
The Axe was stolen from a show
case on the UC Berkeley campus
j last June. An investigation has
I been in progress since then.
John Kirbey-Miller, head of UC's
senior Axe-finding committee, said
yesterday that no new clues have
been directed his way.
"Our committcc is no detectivc
agency," he added. "We can't do
much until we get more clues."
Meanwhile, there have been
abounding rumors on the campus
here that the Axe is in the posses
sion of a Stanford fraternity.
Gene Dils, president of the Inter
fraternity Council, said he made an
investigation of several fraternity
houses and that the investigations
showed there was no truth to the
rumors.
Representatives of Stanford and
UC reported they believed that if
the Axe docs not show up prior to
the Big Game it could show up in
one of the rooting sections during
j the game.
Ralph Vetterlein, president of the
Associated Students of UC, said that
if the Axe was not found by Big
Game time, a facsimile of it may be
made for presentation to the win
ner of the Big Game.
''But," he added, "that would be a
poor substitute and we'd hate to
I have to do it."
