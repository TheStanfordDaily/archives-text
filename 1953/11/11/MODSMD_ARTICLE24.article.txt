# Brownell, Truman, and Spy Case
## 
### 
It wiould seem that Attorney General Herbert
Brownell and former President Harry S. Tru
man, the two key iigures in the current debate
over the Harry Dexter White spy case, owe the
American people a far more detailed explana
tion of the case than they have so far offered.
Though leveling charges that cast grave re
flections on the former president, his party, and
his administration, the attorney general has
failed as yet to specify the exact source of his
information.
Mr. Truman, on the other hand, has said he
will wait "until the time is right" to answer
the charge, whenever that may be.
We feel that the nation deserves an im
mediate explanation from both officials, so
that the people themselves can properly evalu
ate and understand the charge which is fast be
coming swelled into a partisan issue.
The case itsell revolves around a former
executive director of the International Mone
tary Fund, Mr. White, who was appointed to
the post in 1945 by Mr. Truman. Mr. Brown
ell asserts that Mr. Truman, betore making
the appointment, had been informed by the
Federal Bureau ol Investigation that Mr.
White was suspected cl belonging to a Com
munist group.
It is the attorney general's contention that
Mr. Truman deliberately disregarded an official
report of the FBI when he elevated Mr. White
from a post in the Treasury Department to the
directorship of IMF.
Mr. Truman, on the other hand, has said he
never saw an FBI report on Mr. White at the
time he was considering the appointment.

The extreme gravity of the charge made (
against the former Chief Executive lays open
to suspicion not only his personal integrity and
ability but also the character and intent of the
policies and programs adopted during his 9ev
€»n-year administration a cancerous condition
that Mr. Brownell, as chief tactician for the
GOP, has avidly been attempting to advance.
Another serious ramification of the charge
is that it lends credence to the mouthings of
such persons as Senators McCarthy and Jen
ner who apparently draw their political sus- I
tenance largely from scandal and sensation.
If the charge that Mr. Truman blatantly by
passed this nation's chief security organization,
as alleged by Mr. Brownell, is true, then the na- |
tion has the right to know.
Qn the other hand, the nation has just as com
pelling a right to know if, as many people sus- '
pect, the charge was made by Mr. Brownell for
primarily political advantage.
In either instance, the people should know
the lacts, so that they can protect themselves !
either against the possibility that Commu- I
nists have been allowed to seep into the gov
ernment or against the possibility that the
present Administration might be employing
demagogic practices to retain its popularity.
There are details galore that need explain- j
ing. Did Mr. Trurnan receive the report? !
From what sources did the FBI get its informa
tion on Mr. White? How did Mr. Brownell come
by it?
We ask that answers to these and all gues
tions laised by the charge be given immedi
ately.
