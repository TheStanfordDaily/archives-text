# BULL SESSION

### DICK MANSFIELD 
A large sign in eight colors announced that what
had once been a dingy den in the Toyon cellar was now
Emerald City, California; Home of
THE WIZARD ()I< OZ
Audience with or without appointment. Spells
cast, card tricks taught, cars repaired.
Occult vision a specialty.
The Wizard Is Entranced. Fray Be Seated.
Please! No Loud Laughter!
One of the Boys, in pin-stripe suit with larue shoul-

der pads, edged into the Wizard's
den.
"Say, Wiz," said he, "Is all that
stuff there on the sign true? Are
you on the level?"
"Just like a carpenter," said
the Wizard brightly, polishing his
nails on his checkered vest. "I
also hex Civ lecturers and breathe
new life into old ponies — for a
fee, naturally."
"Naeherly," said the goon, dig-

ging out a roll of bills. "Here's a G—we got a little
job for you." •
"Enchanted," said the Wizard. "What did you
hnve in mind?"
"Well, see, we got us a little interest in the forth
coming touch football titanic for the glory of the
Intra Murals, pitting lota Psi against Encina Center.
Wo wanna see them Psi boys win, get me, only they
is all out of shape, not having kept in very good
training, while these Encina boys got rosy cheeks
and gel. milk with their meals, see, and so they is
last on their feet and quick-like, only it is up to
you to fix this up, on account of we got a lot of
pins tied up in Psi, catch on?"

"I'll see what can he clone," said the Wizard. "Fees
are payable in advance."
Then the Wizard sat up all night, brewing potions
and making passes in the«ftir, and when dawn broke,
Slingshot Flynn, Encina's ace quarterback, had van
ished. Then the Wizard donned his Buster Brown,
got on his tricycle, and went c>v/t to Encina. Encina
Center gladly accepted his services as a substitute
quarterback, and practices continued for the intra
murals' Big Game.
Came that fateful Saturday morning, and the intra
mural field was shrouded in fog. The big, brawny
lota Psis ran through signals slowly, and eventually j
lay down under their cars to rest. The Wizard, mean- j
while, ran Encina Center up and down the field. The
v#histle blew, the Iot;i Psis kicked off, and the game ;
was under way.
The Wizard of Oz was an uncanny ball-handler. He
could fake five times, keep the ball himself, and still I
reel off twenty. The rock-ribbed lota P.si defense
barely held on the one inch line, time and time again. j
But the lota Psi offense was also sluggish. One back
after another was carried away, exhausted, to the
house, and the game went into the final five sec- !
onds, still scoreless.
"Look," said the Wizard in the huddle, "this is my
greatest play! It's sure to score. I call it my Abra
carabra Flip, and it will spring a man loose for a
sure TD. Everybody sprint out for a pass on count J
one hundred and seven!"
They crouched. The Wizard tolled off the count. |
Everybody went out for a pass. The Wizard faked
seven times and handed off to the lota Psi leit guard,
who, lo as the Wizard had said, shook loose for a j
touchdown.
Then the Wizard made a few passes in the air, mut
tered a calculus formula, and vanished, just in time.
