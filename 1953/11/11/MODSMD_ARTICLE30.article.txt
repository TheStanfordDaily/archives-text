# Roble Girls No Problem To New Dorm Director
## 
### SHIRLEY ELDER 
Although she is almost as
new to the Stanford campus as
her 279 freshman girls, Miss
Katherine Riley is readily ad
justing to her job as Roble di
rector and looking forward to
! her first California winter.
i
"I've always wanted to come to
j California," Miss Riley said as she
| explained how she quickly applied
for the Roble job last summer when
j a friend told her about the opening.
Her experience as head counselor
j of Comstock Hall, an undergraduate
! women's dormitory at the Univer-

sity of Minnesota, has equipped her i
for counseling Roble girls as well
as her long residence in Minnesota |
has prepared her to appreciate the
local weather.
So far, she says, the Roble girls
have not presented any greater
problems than how to shine flood- (
lights on the float they worked on j
with the Village frosh, and whether j
or not their television set should be !
moved from the recreation room in j
Roble's basement to the living room, j
The immediate lighting problem \
was solved by connecting them to a !
room on the second floor, and the |
float went on to win sweepstakes |
honors in the parade. The TV set j
was moved upstairs.
Early in the quarter, a Roble girl j
came up to Miss Riley and an- j
nounced she was lonesome. Miss !
Riley protested the girl was too
cheerful about it to be really upset,
but they sat down for a long chat
and the freshman left to continue
her new collegiate life.
The new director later explained

sale thinks it is difficult for the col
lege newcomers to settle down to
class work after the rush of moving
in and Pre-Reg week activities.
Miss Riley received her A.B. and
A.M. degrees from Minnesota and
has been most currently teaching
business management in their
School of Business Administration.
During the war, she worked with
the Justice Department in Washing
ton, D.C.
Working with Miss Riley as as
sistant director of Roble i.s Theano
"Thee" Pappas. Miss Pappas served
as resident assistant at Durand
House last year and at Lagunita this
past summer.
Another assistant already well
known to Roble girls is Mrs. Bar
nett, who is starting her third year
as night assistant.
