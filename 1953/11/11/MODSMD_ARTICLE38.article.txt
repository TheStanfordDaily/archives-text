And so where does Stanford stand in the Rose Bowl race? Unless you've
just blown in from the Arctic wastelands, you've probably heard that a
guy named Tsagalakis rooted his toe into a football and that Stanford, alas,
is no longer undefeated in Pacific Coast Conference play.
Thf Imlinnc nrp now tied with the Bruins in PCC play with five wins

and one loss. A triumph for the Trojans over UCLA
two weeks hence, coupled with a Stanford Big Game
win. would nicely resolve the situation. So would a
Stanford loss and a UCLA win. In case of a tie in league
standings, there are three factors which would deter
mine the Rose Bowl representative:
(1) Most important in the case of a tie is the team
that beats the other, Stanford in this case. It has al
ways been the case when two teams have tied in the
final standings that the team which has beaten the
other has been selected to go to the Rose Bowl.
(2) When the teams are tied and have not met each

tHiier, me non-conference record is considered. In this case. UCLA is
definitely superior. A fat score over rugged San Jose Stale this weekend,
not to mention a win, wouldn't do any harm. >
(3) In the case of a tie vote among the PCC bigwigs (not to be confused
with a tie in conference standings), the bid would go to UCLA, since Stan- |
ford has been a more recent Rose Bowl participator than the Bruins.
But, as we mentioned, the first item carries by far the most weight, and j
so if the Indians take Cal, they will probably be selected.
It's an interesting note that Chuck Taylor, who previous to the USC loss
even refused to mention the Rose Bowl, said Monday, "I've heard some talk !
that UCLA would be a better representative in the Rose Bowl. I don't think
that's exactly true. Sure, we travel by the air, but we get touchdowns, don't j
we? It doesn't make any difference how you get them. I think our kids j
will try their best to beat California and get the Rose Bowl bid."

Here it is—the most shocking news since the administration raised the
tuition! Game movies reveal that on Sam Tsagalakis' field goal play,
USC's Linden Crow was definitely guilty of holding Stanford's Ted
Tanner, who had momentarily broken through.
If the zebra shirts had seen it.it would have been a 15 yard penalty
against Troy, thus almost certainly preventing a Trojan victory.
Death, where is thy sting?

There's considerable dissatisfaction with USC Coach Jess Hill in the I
Southland. Many observers feel that Hill gets by far the best material in j
the conference (money speaks) and does the least with it.
Hill got off one of the most laughable statements of the year when he j
said, "We deserved to win. We planned that interception."
He didn't mention if he also planned the 10 straight passes that Garrett j
completed prior to the interception.

The coaches agree that Stanford played its best game of the year last
Saturday. The blocking and tackling was sharper than it had ever been be
fore. George Lynn, who has seen the Trojans in four games, said, "Southern
Cal also got off by far their best game last Saturday. They were much
better against us than they were against Cal."

Bob Garrett was chosen in the United Press "Backfield of the Week"
again. Two Stanford linemen also were selected: Norm Manoogian and
Sam Morley. The chant is growing for Garrett for All-American. Chron
icle Sports Editor Bill Leiser, who is very influential in national All-Ameri
can selections, calls Garrett "the best college passer I've seen in 3 years."
Jack McDonald, sports editor of the Call-Bulletin, names the Garrett-
Morley combo the "best passing team I've seen in 35 years."

Orchids to the most under-rated player on the Coast—guard Phil Wilson.
According to Taylor, the game movies show that Wilson made more tackles
than any other man on the field.
More orchids to Sam Morley who made two of the greatest catches last
weekend we've ever seen. Morley now has caught 103 in his career (35 this
year) and may end the season having a record for more catches than any
other major collegian. You can count on the fingers of one hand ends of a
major college who have caught mor<*than 100 passes.
