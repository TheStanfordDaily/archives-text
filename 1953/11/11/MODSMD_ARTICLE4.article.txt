# TUESDAY SERIES
## Arctic Scenes Are Described 
### BILL WRIGHT 
The Arctic wilderness was de
scribed to the Tuesday Evening Se
ries audience last night in glowing
words and vivid color slides by
George L. Collins and Lowell Sum
ner of the National Park Service.
Collins, chief of the State and
Territorial Co - operation of the
Park Service, made a short intro
ductory talk on "Arctic Wilderness
Values."
Sumner — photographer, biolo
gist, and aviator for the Park
Service — described a scrips of
slides made the past two sum
mers while exploring northeast
ern Alaska.
The area traveled by the explo
ration party, which extends from
the Arctic Ocean to the Brooks
Range mountains and from Alaska
into northwestern Canada, known
officially as "The Arctic Northwest
ern Wilderness," was called by Col
lins "practically the only undis
turbed wilderness area left on the
continent."
The purpose of the expedition
was to trace the trails of huge
herds of caribou and to travel
the length of one of the previous
ly unexplored rivers.
The river travel was so difficult
that on their best day the party
progressed only seven miles in 14
hours.
The party also found meager evi
dence of the inhabitance of prehis
toric man, evidence which is now
being analyzed by the University of
Pennsylvania.
The slides substantiated Collins'
statement that the territory is "no
vague frost, ice, and mist en
shrouded land of frigid tempera
tures with little to highlight it in
scenic beauty."
Instead, during the summer it is
green and wooded. Many birds
from Central America and coastal
California make it their summer
home. The area is the breeding
ground for the Mississippi Valley
Songbird, swans, and other species
which arc now close lo extinction.
And the winters arc not as
bleak as generally assumed, Col
lins stated. Although the area is
covered with snow for lon# pe
riods, the total precipitation is
only seven or eight inches, and
the caribou have litllc trouble
finding food.
Slides showed that the snow is
blown from the mountain sides, al
lowing sheep to prosper on the
slopes.
Collins said, "The difficulty in the
Arctic will not be in making use of
the country, but in learning enough
about it to use sense in caring for
it."
The photographs included a series
of pictures of a sunrise (at 1 a.m.)
and scenes of lakes which boast fish
more than a yard long, of the 80-
mile Arctic plain, and of a herd of
2G,500 caribou.
