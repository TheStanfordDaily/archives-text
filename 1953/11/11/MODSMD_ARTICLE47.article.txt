# Japanese Professor Says His Country Won't Go Red

"I don't think that Japan will
ever become a Communist na
tion," declared Dr. Hideo Kashi
moto, visiting professor from the
University of Tokyo.
Kashimoto, who is teaching a
course in contemporary Asian reli
gion at Stanford this quarter, gave
two reasons to support his state
ment:
"In the first place, the majority
of Japanese don't believe in revo
lution by force. In the second
placc, the control of the minority
over the majority which is advo
cated by the Communists is not
acceptable to the Japanese."
The fact that Communism is a
living subject in Japan was empha
sized by Kashimoto.
"In America, discussion of Com
munism can still be on a philosophi
cal level. In Japan one has to live
with it. We are on the frontier of
the American sphere. Next door is
Communism. With us it's a matter
of life or death."
Kashimoto, who has been on the
staff of the University of Tokyo
since 1926 (except for 1931-34 when
he was instructing at Harvard Uni
versity for his Master's degree), is
chairman of the Japanese committee
for arranging seminars in American
studies held in Tokyo during the
summers.
This committee had its start four
years ago, when the cx-prcsidcnt
of Tokyo University, Dr. Nambara,

met Dr. Sterling and drew up an
agreement to send exchange profes
sors to Japan to teach young Japa
nese the truth about America.
Every summer, five professors,
from every part of the United
States, go to Tokyo to teach in their
fields of philosophy, history, politi
cal science, and economics. These
seminars arc made possible by
Rockefeller Foundation grants.
"They are a huge success," com
mented Hashimoto, ''mainly be
cause they are not conducted on a
pro-America basis. Scholars come
from all over Japan to learn the
truth about America. When they
know, they cannot hate urrrcason
ingly."
Asked about the notoriety of Sen
ator Joseph McCarthy in Japan,
Kashimoto said that the Wisconson
ian was as well kncJwn as President
Eisenhower to the average Japanese.
"We get the impression from your
journalists that McCarthyism is tak
ing over the United States, and we
are very apprehensive about the sit
uation."
The thing that confuses the Japa
nese the most, he claimed, is that
such a man as McCarthy could be
electcd and re-elected.
"McCarthy has definitely hurt
American prestige in Japan, lie
is a had symbol of your democ
racy."
On the subject of a possible third
World War, Kashimoto was definite
in his reply.
"We in Japan have no time to
philosophize about a third World
War. But we can say that we de
cidedly don't want one. We're sure,
located as we are on the frontier of
democracy and Communism, that
our country would be used for the
battlefield and would-be destroyed
completely."
