### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 (UP) —The House Un-American Activi
ties committee today subpoenaed former President Truman, Gov.
James F. Byrnes, and Supreme Court Justice Tom C. Clark to tell
what they know about the Harry Dexter White "spy" case.
It was the first time in American history, according to the Library

of Congress, that a former President' 1
had been subpoenaed by Congress.
Mr. Truman indicated he will
comply with the unprecedented
summons and appear for questioning
at 10:30 a.m. Friday. The former
President accepted his subpoena in
New York at 4:40 p.m. Byrnes, who
is scheduled to testify Thursday, was
served at Columbia, S.C., at 7:40 p.m.
Committee chairman Harold H.
Velde (R—111.) bypassed committee
Democrats and even some Republi
cans in issuing the subpoenas for
Mr. Truman and the South Carolina
Governor.
Asked if he would comply with (
the order, the former President
said: "Well, I accepted the sub
poenae. Draw your own conclu
sions."
Democratic congressional sour
ces said Mr. Truman's statement
"indicates he'll he here all right."
There was no immediate indication
whether the hearings will he pub
lic or secret.
Byrnes refused to say whether or
not he would appear before the com
mittee as ordered. He presumably
could decline on the ground that
it would interfere with his duties as
governor.
Rep. Kit Clardy (R-Mich.), a com
mittee member, told the United
Press that Clark also has been sub
poenaed for questioning Friday.
Clark, who was Attorney General
at the time White was promoted, was
not immediately available for com
ment.
Former Assistant Attorney Gen
eral T. Lamar Caudle said at his
home in Wadesboro, N.C., that he
also has received a subpoena to ap
pear before the House committee
Thursday. Caudle, who was assist
ant to Clark at the time of the White
affair, said he will appear on sched
ule.
In a prepared speech delivered at
a dinner of the Alumni Association
of City College of New York tonight,
Truman made a defense of his rec
ord in office in checking communism
and trying to preserve the rights of
the individual.
He warned the Eisenhower admin
istration that if it does not distin
guish between "the real dangers of
communism and the hysterical fear
of it" this country is in for some
"bad times."
"In all I did, When I was Presi
dent, to combat communism," Tru
man said, "I always sought to pre
serve the* rights of the individual.
I always tried to hold in chcck
those ugly passions of intolerance
and hate which can he so easily
manipulated by unscrupulous
demagogues.
"For this I was sometimes ac
cuscd of being soft. This, of course,
is ridiculous. I think the record
will prove it."
Meanwhile, the Democratic rta
tional chairman accused Attorney
General Herbert Brownell, Jr., of
going "so far as to impugn the loy
alty" of former President Truman
"just to bail out his party."
The Democratic chairman,
Stephen A. Mitchell, charged spe
cifically that the Republicans
raised an uproar over the Harry
Dexter White case to cover up "a

mess in New York and New Jer
! sey."
Brownell made the original charge
that Mr. Truman appointed White
to a sensitive post in the face of an
FBI report White was a Russian
spy.
"The Republicans lost the govern
i orship of New Jersey largely be
| cause of association between Repub
| licans and racketeering," Mitchell
I told a statewide Democratic party
meeting in Little Rock.
Brownell, he said, had to "bail
out his party."
% "Obviously it had to be some
thing sensational," Mitchell said,
"so Mr. Brownell obtained Presi
dent Eisenhower's approval to
{ bring up once again the case of
Harry Dexter White."

Stephen A. Mitchell, charged spe
cifically that the Republicans
raised an uproar over the Harry
Dexter White case to cover up "a

mess in New York and New Jer
! sey."
Brownell made the original charge
that Mr. Truman appointed White
to a sensitive post in the face of an
FBI report White was a Russian
spy.
"The Republicans lost the govern
i orship of New Jersey largely be
| cause of association between Repub
| licans and racketeering," Mitchell
I told a statewide Democratic party
meeting in Little Rock.
Brownell, he said, had to "bail
out his party."
% "Obviously it had to be some
thing sensational," Mitchell said,
"so Mr. Brownell obtained Presi
dent Eisenhower's approval to
{ bring up once again the case of
Harry Dexter White."
