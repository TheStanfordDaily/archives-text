## Members Hear Reports On NSA Meeting 
### BOB REZAK Associate Editor, The Daily 
The Executive Committee last
night heard reports on Stan
ford's participation in the re
gional conference of the Na
tional Students Association held
in Los Angeles last weekend,
then went into a lengthy dis
cussion of what Stanford's role
in the organization should be in
the future.
The reports were made by ASSU
President Don Lozabnick, Vice Pres
ident Jeannie Bobis, Student Man
ager John Stahr, and Men's Hall
Representative Bob Mishell, who
were among Stanford's delegates to
the meeting.
Mishell said he was "sadly disap
pointed" in the meeting. "It lacked
proper organization and tried to con
sider problems beyond the scope of
the group and I believe it accom
plished almost nothing," he de
clared.
"It must be borne in mind," Mi
shell emphasized, "that I was un
able to attend the workshops and
therefore 1 cannot evaluate the
assembly as a whole."
Mishell said Stanford must first
decide what it thinks is the purpose
of the regional organization and if
that purpose is being fulfilled now.
He added that Stanford should
also dccide that "if by our leader
ship and participation wc can help
the region fulfill its purpose, and
finally, if not, let us disaffiliate
from the organization."
Lozabnick declared that Stanford
must now "fully realize that NSA in
this region is just taking its first
moves around in its cradle and is
nowhere near adolescence as other
regions, and recognize the picture
of NSA which is still constantly de
veloping towards maturity."
Stahr said that Stanford "should
not judge NSA on two mornings'
work." If Stanford is going to dccide
if NSA is "good," he added, it will
take more active participation and
"real work on our part."
Present at last night's Excom
meeting was Jim Edwards, president
of NSA.
Edwards told Excom members that
Stanford must "bear in mind" that
NSA is "now your association. It
doesn't do any more, any less than
its members direct it to do. It's up
to you and other schools in the re
gion to carry the ball," he declared.

regions, and recognize the picture
of NSA which is still constantly de
veloping towards maturity."
Stahr said that Stanford "should
not judge NSA on two mornings'
work." If Stanford is going to dccide
if NSA is "good," he added, it will
take more active participation and
"real work on our part."
Present at last night's Excom
meeting was Jim Edwards, president
of NSA.
Edwards told Excom members that
Stanford must "bear in mind" that
NSA is "now your association. It
doesn't do any more, any less than
its members direct it to do. It's up
to you and other schools in the re
gion to carry the ball," he declared.
The Executive Committee last
night heard reports on Stan
ford's participation in the re
gional conference of the Na
tional Students Association held
in Los Angeles last weekend,
then went into a lengthy dis
cussion of what Stanford's role
in the organization should be in
the future.
The reports were made by ASSU
President Don Lozabnick, Vice Pres
ident Jeannie Bobis, Student Man
ager John Stahr, and Men's Hall
Representative Bob Mishell, who
were among Stanford's delegates to
the meeting.
Mishell said he was "sadly disap
pointed" in the meeting. "It lacked
proper organization and tried to con
sider problems beyond the scope of
the group and I believe it accom
plished almost nothing," he de
clared.
"It must be borne in mind," Mi
shell emphasized, "that I was un
able to attend the workshops and
therefore 1 cannot evaluate the
assembly as a whole."
Mishell said Stanford must first
decide what it thinks is the purpose
of the regional organization and if
that purpose is being fulfilled now.
He added that Stanford should
also dccide that "if by our leader
ship and participation wc can help
the region fulfill its purpose, and
finally, if not, let us disaffiliate
from the organization."
Lozabnick declared that Stanford
must now "fully realize that NSA in
this region is just taking its first
moves around in its cradle and is
nowhere near adolescence as other
regions, and recognize the picture
of NSA which is still constantly de
veloping towards maturity."
Stahr said that Stanford "should
not judge NSA on two mornings'
work." If Stanford is going to dccide
if NSA is "good," he added, it will
take more active participation and
"real work on our part."
