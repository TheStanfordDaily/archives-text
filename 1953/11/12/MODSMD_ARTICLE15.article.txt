# Annual Big Game Gaieties Will Open Tuesday Night
## 
### Jerry Simpsoon 
Ram's Head members are putting the last bit of polish on this
year's production of Big Game Gaieties.
Gaieties is traditionally the big effort by the student body to
back the team for the Big Game. The musical prelude to the
annual tussle with Cal opens Tuesday night at 9:15 for a four-day

run. One of the outstanding features
of the show is the unusually large
number of costume changes and the
unusualness of the design and exe
cution of the sets and costume ma
terials.
Director of this year's show is
Warner Leßoy, who says that the
quality of this year's Gaieties is
"outstanding'' and is boosted by
one of the most talented casts
Gaieties has ever seen. Several
members of the cast arc members
of previous shows and have taken
part in various other campus and
local productions.
Costumes for the variety show
have been designed by Bucket
Christensen and Lynn Atterbury.
Departing from the general theme
of the show, Miss Christensen has
designed a number of costumes
which seem absolutely unusable for
a successful variety show. Several
of the costumes have unmatching
material and hems are conspicuously
missing and at other times uneven.
This ridiculous garb is to be used
in a number of the show which
shows what a cast might look like
appearing in the 4000 th production
of a show, dressed in the original
costumes.
Original music for the show has
been written by Dick Bares, who
has also written for other Gaieties
productions. Judy Schaefer and
Iluth Binns have collaborated with
Bares to enhance this original mu
sic with sparkling lyrics of their
own. Directors of the show feel
fortunate to have as dance director
and choreographer Judy Dicken
son who is a danccr for the Stock
ton Symphony italic!. Miss Dick
enson has also worked on past
Gaieties.

Featured in the cast are Bill
Burke, tenor, who will be remem
bered by many for his excellent
performance in last year's spring
show. Steve Stevenson, Merritt
Johnson, Richie Meyer, Ron Fein
berg, and Virginia Royce head the
large cast.

Ram's Head members are putting the last bit of polish on this
year's production of Big Game Gaieties.
Gaieties is traditionally the big effort by the student body to
back the team for the Big Game. The musical prelude to the
annual tussle with Cal opens Tuesday night at 9:15 for a four-day

run. One of the outstanding features
of the show is the unusually large
number of costume changes and the
unusualness of the design and exe
cution of the sets and costume ma
terials.
Director of this year's show is
Warner Leßoy, who says that the
quality of this year's Gaieties is
"outstanding'' and is boosted by
one of the most talented casts
Gaieties has ever seen. Several
members of the cast arc members
of previous shows and have taken
part in various other campus and
local productions.
Costumes for the variety show
have been designed by Bucket
Christensen and Lynn Atterbury.
Departing from the general theme
of the show, Miss Christensen has
designed a number of costumes
which seem absolutely unusable for
a successful variety show. Several
of the costumes have unmatching
material and hems are conspicuously
missing and at other times uneven.
This ridiculous garb is to be used
in a number of the show which
shows what a cast might look like
appearing in the 4000 th production
of a show, dressed in the original
costumes.
Original music for the show has
been written by Dick Bares, who
has also written for other Gaieties
productions. Judy Schaefer and
Iluth Binns have collaborated with
Bares to enhance this original mu
sic with sparkling lyrics of their
own. Directors of the show feel
fortunate to have as dance director
and choreographer Judy Dicken
son who is a danccr for the Stock
ton Symphony italic!. Miss Dick
enson has also worked on past
Gaieties.

Featured in the cast are Bill
Burke, tenor, who will be remem
bered by many for his excellent
performance in last year's spring
show. Steve Stevenson, Merritt
Johnson, Richie Meyer, Ron Fein
berg, and Virginia Royce head the
large cast.
