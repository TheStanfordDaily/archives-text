WASHINGTON, Nov. 11 (UP) â€”
President Eisenhower told his news
conference today he found it in
conceivable that Mr. Truman or any
man in the presidency would know
ingly injure the United States by ap
pointing to public office a man ident
ified as a spy.
In response to rapid-fire questions,
the President went on to say that it
was his personal belief that neither
Mr. Truman nor Clark should have
been subpoenaed by the House com
mittee.
However, Mr. Eisenhower defend
' ed Attorney General Herbert Brow
nell for bringing details of the White
case to public attention again and
said his information is that high
Truman administration officials
knew of subversion in the govern
ment.
He also defended the right of Con
gress to conduct investigations and
said it is a fact that Russia has been
stealing U.S. secrets even though
the United States offered in 1946 to
share its atomic knowledge as a
contribution to world pcace.
Mr. Eisenhower took the attitude
that former high administration of
ficials should tell what they know
