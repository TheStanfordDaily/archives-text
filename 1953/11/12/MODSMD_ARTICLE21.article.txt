WASHINGTON, Nov. 11 (UP) â€”
Adlai E. Stevenson has lashed "im
petuous politicians" for what he
called their "disrespect and reckless
procedure" in subpoenaing Mr. Tru
man. Supreme Court Justice Tom C.
Clark, and Gov. James F. Byrnes
of South Carolina.
The 1952 Democratic presidential
nominee said such .action "for par
tisan purposes" could "dangerously
discredit" congressional investiga
tions and hurt the "high office of the
presidency and the world we must
lead."
