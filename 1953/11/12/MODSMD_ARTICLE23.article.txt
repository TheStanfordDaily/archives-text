WASHINGTON, Nov. 11 (UP)—Former President Truman's ap
pearance before House investigators in the Harry Dexter White
"spy" case was thrown into confusion tonight when Demoocrats
said his appearance had been postponed and Republicans said
it had not.

ference he would not have subpoe
naed Mr. Truman or Supreme
Court Justice Tom C. Clark.
The House Un-American Activi
ties Committee had ordered both to
appear Friday.
Mr. Eisennower also said he could
not conceive of Mr. Truman know
ingly harboring a Russian spy in the
U.S. government. But the President
strongly defended the action of At
torney General Herbert Brownell,
Jr., in laying the case. before the
public.
The Senate Internal Security sub
committee announced that its inves
tigation will get under way at 2:30
p.m., EST (11:30 a.m., PST), tomor-

former military aide, and Vaughan's
ex-secretary, Ruth Anderson. Se
cret sessions will be held at 10:30
a.m. and 2 p.m.

pany (immediately announced it
would ;televise the afternoon hear
ing. Columbia Broadcasting System
planned to broadcast portions of il,
later. Dumont had not yet made up
its mind. The National Broadcast
ing Company said it would not car
ry the hearings "live."
As the furor over the explosive
White case spread to nearly ;ill
quarters, there were these major
developments:
1. Democrats on the House Com
mittee said Rep. Clyde Doyle (D,,
Calif.) had been notified in Califoi
nia that Mr. Truman would not be
heard this week. But Robert Mi
chel, administrative assistant to
committee chairman Harold H.
Velde (R., 111.), said Mr. Truman
would be questioned on schedule:.
2. Rep. Kit Clardy (R„ Mich.),
a committee member, said there is
"no doubt hearings will be held
in this matter but nobody knows
whether they will be held this
week.'' Clardy wanted to ques
tion Gov. James F. Byrnes of
South Carolina before hearing Mr.
Truman. They have given vary
ing accounts of how Mr. Truman
handled the White case.
3. Byrnes notified the committee;
that as head of a sovereign state ho
could not comply with a subpena
to appear here. But he offered to
answer promptly any questions the
committee cared to submit.
4. Rep. Francis E. Walter (Pa.),
ranking Democrat on the House
committee, charged that Mr. Tru
man had "no greater access" to
FBI reports on White than did Mr.
