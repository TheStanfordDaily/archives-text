### DICK MANSFIELD 
Over on the Sports Desk sit a great many journalists
who confine their journalistic talents mainly to ath
letic doings and who, for the duration of the football
season, ar<j all entitled Peerless Pigskin Prognostica-

tors. These are the same Peerless
Pigs k in Prognosticates who,
clear back last summer, were
giving everyone who would listen
a hot tip that UCLA had a fair
chance to edge Oregon State in
the season opener. And this be
fore they even threw out the first
football! Imagine.
But these days, Peerless Pig
skin Prognosticators are not the
only mortals who habitually peer

jnto crystal balls and pronounce psychic pronounce
ments. Clairvoyants are getting to be as thick as USC
linemen around here. See here:
First, we have the Quiz Master. His buddies slip
him u few bob to oil up Ihe wheels and gears in his
forecasting mechanism, and then, without apparent
effort, he says, "Aw, the old boy will probably ask us
for the significant impact of the economic customs
under Louis XV upon common practice in Wall Street
today . . ." The buddies are then pacified and the
seer's pockets jingle. The Quiz Master is, theoreti
cally, a handy man to have around before mid-terms.
Then, of course, there is the perennial weather man,
who is by far the most common specie. In the morn-

ing, the Mystical Meteorologist arises and gazes out
at the fog. He sniffs the air and he wiggles his bunion.
"It's going to snow!" he says. Skeptics guffaw. But
there are always those who listen. However, weather
men are so common that everyone besides the skeptic
or the dupe has his own opinion.
The Matinee Mystic (Cinematic Soothsayer) is the
man who predicts what kind of a cartoon there will
be, what kind of a story Bill Stern is going to tell,
or what the Pete Smith Specialty will concern. "Yair,
I told ya!" he will scream gleefully: "Donald Duck!"
Some suspect that the Matinee Mystic works hand in
glove with M.G.M. He also foresees studio previews
and the price of popcorn.
A small-scale Peerless Pigskin Prognosticator will
tell Almost anyone what kind of a play the quarter
back will call next: "Watch! Third and seven ori the
42 â€”he'll call for a triple spinner with pitchout to the
wingback . . ."He can also tell you when the officials
are measuring a first down, what the decision will be.
Notice that he seldom wagers on his own forecasts,
however.
Best known, of course, is the original crystal-ball
gazer, the Gypsy. Seen at Stanford mostly in booths
at the Row Carnival, the Gypsy eyes tea leaves,
paws palms, shuffles cards, looks you right in the eye,
and says in a heavy (possibly assumed) Bohemian ac
cent: "You are laboring under the weight of a great,
surpassing shame." And you totter away, wondering
how in the world she knew you were a freshman.
