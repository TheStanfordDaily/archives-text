## Complains About Seats at SC Game 
### 
To the Editor:
i have two questions to ask as a rooter at the SC
game. Why wasn't the rooters' section on the fifty
yard line as SC's was instead of between the twenty
and the for ty yard lines? Why was our fifty yard line
occupied by SC rooters? It doesn't seem fair for SC

to get both fifty yard lines. The spirit was great but
no thanks to the seats. Next year it might be smart
for Stanford students to buy SC alums' tickets and
thereby get good seats.
