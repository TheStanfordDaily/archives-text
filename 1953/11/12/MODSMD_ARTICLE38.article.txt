Professor Felix M. Keesing,
executive head of the Depart
ment of Sociology and Anthro
pology at Stanford,* returned re
cently from Noumea, French
New Caledonia, where he
served as chairman of the
twelfth session of the South
Pacific Commission.
The commission has a mandate to
develop advisory and consultative
functions throughout the South Pa
cific area. It has seats for six na
tions, and has two representatives
from each nation.
The nations of the commission
are Australia, France, the Nether
lands, New Zealand, the United
Kingdom, and the United States.
Dr. Keesing was appointed by
President Eisenhower to be senior
commissioner for the United States
on the six-nation commission. He
will continue to serve for two years
in this post, which he has held since
it was established in 1948.
Chairmanship of the committee is
a rotating office. This year it was
the United States' turn.
Dr. Keesing, as chairman, in his
opening speech to die commission
representatives said that the com
mission's record was a very good
one.
"It has been most fortunate, of
course, in having a highly favor
able climate of opinion and condi
tions of support from the, govern
ments and peoples in the South
Pacific, to enable its program to
take root and grow/ lie said.
Speaking of the commission's
achievements to date, Dr. Keesing
said he considered most important
the quiet inter-consultation and co
operation fostered among the gov
ernments and between the special
ists in the territories.
In a report on the South Pacific
Commission it is reported that "the

commission is providing for the Is
lands peoples, . . . highly qualified
advice on copra and cocoa produc
tion, human, plant, and animal
quarantine, certain diseases, diet,
and the provision of good reading
material."
Other lields of aid are in voca
tional training, industrial devel
opment, and research on infant
mortality.
At the nine-day meeting which
Dr. Keesing attended the commis
sion authorized next year's budget
and work program in the fields of
health, economic development, and
social welfare. This program is car
ried out by a full-time international
technical staff.
