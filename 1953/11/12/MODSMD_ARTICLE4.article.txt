# Stufflebeem: Quad May Cut Photos Short
## 
### 
The possibility that The Quad
might have to abandon taking
individual pictures was revealed
yesterday by Quad co-editor
Jon Stufflebeem.
He said the publication might have
to take the drastic step because of
the lack of response on the part of
students to the schedules set up for
the taking of group and individual â– 
photographs.
Up to yesterday, he said, few stu
dents have kept appointments made
earlier this quarter at the various
living groups.
He said by now lie had iioped
that residents of all groups except
the fraternities and a few women's
row houses could have been pho
tographed.
If this situation continues, he
said, The Quad will not be able to
afford keeping a portrait photogra
pher in its office on Lomita Drive.
Stufflebeem urged, therefore, that
students who might have missed
their appointments to report as soon
as possible to the Quad office to
have their pictures taken.
The office is open Monday
through Friday from 9 to 12 and
from 1 to 5:30. The only excep
tion will be Friday of Big Game
week and Wednesday through
Friday of the Thanksgiving holi
day, when the office will be closed.
He said students need not bother
about making new appointments but
should come when able, preferably
in the morning or during the early
afternoon.
It was the intent of The Quad,
StufTlebeem said, to complete taking
all individual pictures by the end of
this month.
According to the time schedule set
up by The Quad, the pictures of all
coeds should be taken by Nov. 20,
and of all men by Nov. 30.
These deadlines, he indicated,
might have to be moved up to an
earlier date if the number of stu
dents showing up to be photographed ;
continues at its present rate.
