# Taylor May Be 'Coach of Year' Again
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
Stanford's head football coach
Chuck Taylor may become the first
coach in modern history to win the
"Coach of the Year" award twice
in a span of three years.
Two seasons ago, the Card eleven
was picked as a fourth-place club.
Sparked by a Kerkorian to McColl
combination, the Indians went un
defeated for nine straight games,
won the PCC championship, and
went to the Rose Bowl.
In recognition of an outstanding
coaching job, the nation's sports
writers selected Taylor, then in his
first year as head mentor, the
"Coach of the Year."
This season, the Stanford situa
tion in very similar in some re
spects, only the ability of Taylor
and his staff is even more obvious.
Again the Cards were picked lor
lower depths of the league. A pre
season survey of sportswliters along
the coast found only one journalist
picking the Indian eleven for high
er than fourth place. Most writers

saw Stanford between the fourth
and seven spots.
Chuck Taylor does not have
truly outstanding material to
work with. The Cards did not
look impressive as they lost to
COP and edged Oregon, 7-0.
Then, as the effects of Taylor's
coaching began to take effect, the
whole team improved. Morley and
Steinberg are outstanding receivers,
the line and backs are playing well,
and Garrett is up for All-American
honors.
Garrett, incidentally, was little
mentioned for All-Coast honors at
the beginning of the season. Now
he leads the nation in passing.
Taylor lias said that Stanford,
in terms of manpower, doesn't he
long on the same field with UCLA
or USC. Yet (he Cards edged the
Bruins and barely lost (he Trojan
game. The effect of outstanding
coaching is obvious.
Though last year's award went to
Michigan State's Biggie Munn, the
award often does not go to an Unde-

feated team's coach, but to the men
tor considered to have done the best
job.
If any coach in the nation has
done more with the material he has
than Taylor, his name has not come
into public prominence.
So, when the polls for the "Coach
of the Year" award are taken a
little over a week from now, look
for Chuck Taylor's name to be close
to the top.

coaching is obvious.
Though last year's award went to
Michigan State's Biggie Munn, the
award often does not go to an Unde-

feated team's coach, but to the men
tor considered to have done the best
job.
If any coach in the nation has
done more with the material he has
than Taylor, his name has not come
into public prominence.
So, when the polls for the "Coach
of the Year" award are taken a
little over a week from now, look
for Chuck Taylor's name to be close
to the top.

Stanford's head football coach
Chuck Taylor may become the first
coach in modern history to win the
"Coach of the Year" award twice
in a span of three years.
Two seasons ago, the Card eleven
was picked as a fourth-place club.
Sparked by a Kerkorian to McColl
combination, the Indians went un
defeated for nine straight games,
won the PCC championship, and
went to the Rose Bowl.
In recognition of an outstanding
coaching job, the nation's sports
writers selected Taylor, then in his
first year as head mentor, the
"Coach of the Year."
This season, the Stanford situa
tion in very similar in some re
spects, only the ability of Taylor
and his staff is even more obvious.
Again the Cards were picked lor
lower depths of the league. A pre
season survey of sportswliters along
the coast found only one journalist
picking the Indian eleven for high
er than fourth place. Most writers

saw Stanford between the fourth
and seven spots.
Chuck Taylor does not have
truly outstanding material to
work with. The Cards did not
look impressive as they lost to
COP and edged Oregon, 7-0.
Then, as the effects of Taylor's
coaching began to take effect, the
whole team improved. Morley and
Steinberg are outstanding receivers,
the line and backs are playing well,
and Garrett is up for All-American
honors.
Garrett, incidentally, was little
mentioned for All-Coast honors at
the beginning of the season. Now
he leads the nation in passing.
Taylor lias said that Stanford,
in terms of manpower, doesn't he
long on the same field with UCLA
or USC. Yet (he Cards edged the
Bruins and barely lost (he Trojan
game. The effect of outstanding
coaching is obvious.
