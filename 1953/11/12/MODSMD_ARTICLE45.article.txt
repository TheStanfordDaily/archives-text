# SJS Fears Injuns; Coaches Are Wary

### DON STEPHENS 
The rival coaches in Saturday's back-yard squabble —San Jose
State's Bob Bronzan and Stanford's Chuck Taylor - have been ex
uding "alligator tears" in hopes of undermining each other's ef
fort toward attaining a better psychological advantage.
Bronzan's latest attempt was how seemingly helpless his for
ward wall will be in cracking Garrett's pass protection cup.

"If you load up the line with
seven or eight men, Stanford
throws the hook passes and the
flat passes. And if you lie hack to
wait, that Garrett takes his own
sweet time, the ends go into their
snake maneuvers and wind up
getting far out and behind the
secondary.*' Bronzan doesn't have
to resort to such measures to make
his team ready to go Saturday.
His team has a natural. mental
edge.
The Indians have been up for al
most the last month for the Brftin,
Husky, and Trojan crueials and
should face a natural let-down be
tween last week's titanic and the
Big Game on the 21st.
But Taylor, quick to notice this,
has retorted: "We'll not be looking
over the heads of the Spartiyis. We
can't afford to, with fellows like
halfback Larry Matthews and quar
terbacks Benny Pierce and Larry
Rice hitting their season's peak.
To add to Chuck's troubles, Bron
zan reported the steady improve
ment on offense of 245 - pound
tackle Jon Peterson. He has starred
on defense all season.
Pierce excelled early in the sea
son only to succumb to a quarter
back's nemesis—a broken thumb.
With talk like this floating
around, it looks like Taylor will
have no trouble in getting his troops
aroused to win their sixth contest.
Taylor has to win this to have
one non-conference victory to his
credit when the Rose Howl de
cision is made.
True, the pressure is on the In
dians; but the pressure is on win
ning a clear-cut victory, not a Spar
tan victory or a Cardinal moral win.
Spartan passers emulating Bob
Garrett had considerable success
in penetrating the Spartan de
fense, Bronzan said. He also said
that contact work is finished for
the week and only light signal
drills will he held between now
and Saturday.
The Stanford Indians worked out
on offense yesterday, using a mix
ture of running and passing plays
in preparation for their game with
San Jose.
Taylor announced that third
string halfback Dick Crepeau was
out with a severely strained ankle
suffered yesterday and would be
lost to the team for the rest of the
season.

throws the hook passes and the
flat passes. And if you lie hack to
wait, that Garrett takes his own
sweet time, the ends go into their
snake maneuvers and wind up
getting far out and behind the
secondary.*' Bronzan doesn't have
to resort to such measures to make
his team ready to go Saturday.
His team has a natural. mental
edge.
The Indians have been up for al
most the last month for the Brftin,
Husky, and Trojan crueials and
should face a natural let-down be
tween last week's titanic and the
Big Game on the 21st.
But Taylor, quick to notice this,
has retorted: "We'll not be looking
over the heads of the Spartiyis. We
can't afford to, with fellows like
halfback Larry Matthews and quar
terbacks Benny Pierce and Larry
Rice hitting their season's peak.
To add to Chuck's troubles, Bron
zan reported the steady improve
ment on offense of 245 - pound
tackle Jon Peterson. He has starred
on defense all season.
Pierce excelled early in the sea
son only to succumb to a quarter
back's nemesis—a broken thumb.
With talk like this floating
around, it looks like Taylor will
have no trouble in getting his troops
aroused to win their sixth contest.
Taylor has to win this to have
one non-conference victory to his
credit when the Rose Howl de
cision is made.
True, the pressure is on the In
dians; but the pressure is on win
ning a clear-cut victory, not a Spar
tan victory or a Cardinal moral win.
Spartan passers emulating Bob
Garrett had considerable success
in penetrating the Spartan de
fense, Bronzan said. He also said
that contact work is finished for
the week and only light signal
drills will he held between now
and Saturday.
The Stanford Indians worked out
on offense yesterday, using a mix
ture of running and passing plays
in preparation for their game with
San Jose.
Taylor announced that third
string halfback Dick Crepeau was
out with a severely strained ankle
suffered yesterday and would be
lost to the team for the rest of the
season.
The rival coaches in Saturday's back-yard squabble —San Jose
State's Bob Bronzan and Stanford's Chuck Taylor - have been ex
uding "alligator tears" in hopes of undermining each other's ef
fort toward attaining a better psychological advantage.
Bronzan's latest attempt was how seemingly helpless his for
ward wall will be in cracking Garrett's pass protection cup.

"If you load up the line with
seven or eight men, Stanford
throws the hook passes and the
flat passes. And if you lie hack to
wait, that Garrett takes his own
sweet time, the ends go into their
snake maneuvers and wind up
getting far out and behind the
secondary.*' Bronzan doesn't have
