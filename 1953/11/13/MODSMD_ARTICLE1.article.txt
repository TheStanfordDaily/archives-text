## Truman Defies Subpoena To Appear in 'Spy' Case 
### United Press 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 12â€”Former President Truman today de
fied a subpoena issued to him Tuesday by the House Un-American
Activities Committee. He had been asked to appear before the
committee to testify in the Harry Dexter White "spy" case.
The committee has decided not to force Mr. Truman to appear.

Meanwhile, Attorney General
Herbert Brownell, Jr., accepted the
committee's invitation to testify in
support of his charges that Mr. Tru
man promoted White to a high gov
ernment job in the face of two FBI
reports indicating White was a spy
for Russia.
No date has been set for Brown
ell's appearance.
Mr. Truman refused to comply
with the House committee sub
poena on grounds that the com
mittee lacked constitutional au
thority to issue it. He cited prec
edents to back his stand that the
committee action violated the
doctrine of separation of the leg
islative, executive, and judicial
branches.
White, who attended Stanford in
the early 'twenties, served in the
Treasury Department until 1945
when he was appointed by then
President Truman to be U.S. Di
rector of the International Monetary
Fund.
Brownell has charged that, after
receiving FBI reports alleging
White to be a Communist, Tru
man appointed him to this latter
post.
Also subpoenaed to appear were
Supreme Court Justice Tom C.
Clark and Jerome S. Blumauer, the
foreman of a New York federal
grand jury that investigated but
failed to indict White in 1947. Blu
mauer will be questioned tomorrow
in a closed-door session of the com
mittee, but officials doubt that
Clark will make an appearance.
