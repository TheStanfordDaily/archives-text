## 
### 
A plan for the revision of current fraternity rushing policy was
put before the 22 members of Interfraternity Council Wednesday
night by IFC president Gene Dils.
The plan, which most likely will be put to a final IFC vote next
Wednesday evening, calls for the putting off of rushing until
spring quarter. It has been traditional here that rushing be held

at the outset of winter quarter.
In presenting the plan, nils,
who with other leaders of IFC has
studied the proposal, said he
thought that a postponement of
rushing for one quarter would
allow the freshmen to become
more acclimated to University life.
He urged the members of the
council to promote a thorough dis
cussion of the proposal within their
houses.
Besides the postponement, the
IFC also considered the possibil
ity of shortening the actual rush
ing period. This proposal calls
for a rushing period of about one
and a half weeks, the greater part
of which would be devoted to
open houses.
Also, it was proposed that IFC
consider the possibility of eliminat
ing vacation rushing.
