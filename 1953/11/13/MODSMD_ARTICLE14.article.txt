## Costumes Give Big Game Air 
### JERRY SIMPSON 
Mem Aud will echo war-cries
>{ scalp-happy Indians and re
lect the disapproving glances
>{ a pious Queen Victoria next
ruesday night, when Ram's
-lead will open a four-night run
)f the annual Big Game Gaie
ies.
Victoria will make her appcar
\hcc in a scene in the variety show
>112 the Gaieties when she spots a
ocvy of bathing beauties at the sea
shore. No one around Mem Aud is
telling what happens when the
meets the beauties.
The finale of the Gaieties is tra
ditionally the most extravagant
number, and, according to Ram's
Head members, this year's pro
duction will be no exception. The
entire cast—in a red and white
color scheme—is on the sta,?c for
this number to voice the show's
theme: "Win the Big Game."
According to the show's costum
ers, Bucket Christcnsen and Lynn
Attcrbury, this costuming for the
finale represents the hardest part of
the costume crew.
Another costuming problem was
a number of the show done entirely
in blue. The costumes had to dis
play different varieties of the same
color, yet each had to draw atten
tion to itself.
One number, "The 4.000 th Cos
tume Change," is a comedy show
ing what a costume wardrobe
would look like when a cast ap
pears for the four thousandth per
formance.
Those who have been helping on
the costume design and construc
tion are Jackic Wolf, Belinda Rick
lcfs, Judy Doty, Ann Hcrrick, Judy
Dearing, Ellic Kronfeld, Jody Ste
vens, Cynthia Noland. Nancy Os
mcrs, Sharon Davin, Marilyn San
chez-Corca. Dorothy Kookcn, and
Margy Cathcart.
