# Walker Talks On Farm Policy
## 
### HARRY ROBERTS 
"Secretary Benson and the Poli
tics of Reorganization" was the topic
discussed by Dr. Robert A. Walker,
professor of political science, at a
gathering of students and faculty of
the department at 4:15 p.m. yester
day in the Women's Clubhouse.
Dr. Walker explained the reasons
for Secretary Benson's recent re
organization of the Department of
Agriculture, tracing the underlying
elements back to the passage of the
Smith-Lever Act in 1914, which led
to the establishment of the Farm
Bureau Federation.
The reorganization of the depart
ment, according to Dr. Walker, is
an attempt to limit the influence of
the groups opposed to the Farm Bu
reau Federation and allied organi
zations.
He closed by pointing out that the
controversy and confusion stirred up
by this reorganization is merely an
indication of the complex political
picture extant today and does not
; reflect upon the working efficiency
of the department.
Dr. Walker has been teaching
courses in public administration at
Stanford since 1949, and has had
extensive experience in the Depart
ment of Agriculture.
The meeting was sponsored by Pi
Sigma Alpha, national political sci
ence honorary society.
