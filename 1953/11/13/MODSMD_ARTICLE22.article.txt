# Cards Need Decisive Win Tomorrow
## San Jose Seeks 'Backyard' Upset 
### DON STEPHENS 
The San Jose State Spartans,
from down the road a piece, and
the resurgent forces of Garrett
and Co. will settle down to their
annual "Backyard Champion
ship" battle tomorrow at 2 p.m.
in the Stanford Bowl.
So far, the big bullies from Palo
Alto have won all ten of their neigh
borhood scraps.
The San Joseans are expected to
be "up" for their bid for national
prominence and a chance to upset u
potential Rose Bowl entry.
However, contrary to popular
opinion, the Indians will not be
unaware of San Jose and looking
forward to the big one against the
Bears; a decisive victory over the
junior Trojans is a necessity for
four reasons:
1. The Indians want to perpetuate
their undefeated record against the
Spartans. They want no part of an
upset to ruin their 1.000 record.
2. So far this season the Card:,
have dropped two tilts to outside op
ponents, COP and Illinois. They
need a win over a non-conference
team to enhance their position when
the Rose Bowl bid is being decided
between the Bruins and the Indians.
15. Passing wizard Bobby Gar
rett, who is currently leading the.
nation's passers, needs a good day
against the undermanned San Jose
secondary to solidify his position.
4. To the coach, this would be an
excellent opportunity to develop
some reserves to offset Pappy Wal
dorf's "deep freeze," which has been,
one of the reasons for Stanford's in
adequacy in the Big Game.
Coach Chuck Taylor should have
little trouble making these reason .
apparent to his band of gridder.s,
who have had to rise to the threi:
consecutive crucials in a matter o£
four weekends.
Physically, the Indians are at
their full complement with only
Win Wedge with a knee injury as
a doubtful starter. Sam Morlev
may join Wedge if his injured
hand doesn't respond to treatment.
They will be ready for the Big
Game.
The Spartans, coached by affable
Bob Bronzan have improved in their
last two efforts. They played a rut.y
gcd North Texas State squad to
tic and beat the unpredictable COP
Tigers.
Bronzan has a sharp running full
back in Jerry Taylor, plus break
away speed in Larry Matthews and
a cagey field general in quarterha< k
Larry Rice. The defensively minded
coach has molded a rugged line that,
played on more than equal term .
for three quarters with the burly
Bear forwards.
Unlike last season when the
Spartans were awed to a 35-111 de
feat in the 90,000 capacity Stanford
stadium, they have played two
good battles in the California and
Portland bowls. They'll have llieii
mouths closed tomorrow.
Most experts arc hoping to ;<
battle between teams who ulili/"
two extreme phases of offensive
football as their means to gain the
enemy end zone. They will each
feature the pass against the run.
A look at the statistics shows both
squads have almost similar overafl
season marks (SJS 4-3-1; Stanford
5-3).
In the passing department the
Indians have an obvious advantage
with phenomenal Bob Garrett's
radar arm hitting for 100 passes in
17(» attempts for 1448 yards and 11
six-pointers. San Jose State, in
this department, rates puny in
comparison, having only 41 recep
tions in 07 tries for 624 yards and
one touchdown. Stanford's per
| centage is .568, San Jose's .42.'?.
Paradoxically, San Jose is as
strong in the ground game as Stan
ford is in the air. The Spartans have
charged in 393 blasts for 1814 yards,
• while the Indians have run the ball
353 times for only 1155 yards. The
San Joseans have done this amazing
feat despite the loss of Joe Ulm who
was leading the nation in running
after four games, before he was de
clared ineligible along with three
other starters.
The Spartans and the Cardinals
are similar on pass defense having
given up 756 and 764 yards respect-
I ively.
In the stop department, the In
dians are way in front of their
; Santa Clara Valley neighbors. The
locals have yielded only 1437 yards
while the Spartans have been run
through for 1774 yards.
For obvious reasons, the Santa
I Clarans have been working on pass
j defense to stop the passing trium
j viate of Garrett, Morley, and Stein
berg who are also currently tops in
! the PCC.
It looks like an easy Cardinal vic
tory, but the mental situation finds
I the Spartans in the most advantag
i eons position. "We're going nowhere.
I Why not knock off a possible bowl
I entry to make our season a suc
cess?"

They will be ready for the Big
Game.
The Spartans, coached by affable
Bob Bronzan have improved in their
last two efforts. They played a rut.y
gcd North Texas State squad to
tic and beat the unpredictable COP
Tigers.
Bronzan has a sharp running full
back in Jerry Taylor, plus break
away speed in Larry Matthews and
a cagey field general in quarterha< k
Larry Rice. The defensively minded
coach has molded a rugged line that,
played on more than equal term .
for three quarters with the burly
Bear forwards.
Unlike last season when the
Spartans were awed to a 35-111 de
feat in the 90,000 capacity Stanford
stadium, they have played two
good battles in the California and
Portland bowls. They'll have llieii
mouths closed tomorrow.
Most experts arc hoping to ;<
battle between teams who ulili/"
two extreme phases of offensive
football as their means to gain the
enemy end zone. They will each
feature the pass against the run.
A look at the statistics shows both
squads have almost similar overafl
season marks (SJS 4-3-1; Stanford
5-3).
In the passing department the
Indians have an obvious advantage
with phenomenal Bob Garrett's
radar arm hitting for 100 passes in
17(» attempts for 1448 yards and 11
six-pointers. San Jose State, in
this department, rates puny in
comparison, having only 41 recep
tions in 07 tries for 624 yards and
one touchdown. Stanford's per
| centage is .568, San Jose's .42.'?.
Paradoxically, San Jose is as
strong in the ground game as Stan
ford is in the air. The Spartans have
charged in 393 blasts for 1814 yards,
• while the Indians have run the ball
353 times for only 1155 yards. The
San Joseans have done this amazing
feat despite the loss of Joe Ulm who
was leading the nation in running
after four games, before he was de
clared ineligible along with three
other starters.
The Spartans and the Cardinals
are similar on pass defense having
given up 756 and 764 yards respect-
I ively.
In the stop department, the In
dians are way in front of their
; Santa Clara Valley neighbors. The
locals have yielded only 1437 yards
while the Spartans have been run
through for 1774 yards.
For obvious reasons, the Santa
I Clarans have been working on pass
j defense to stop the passing trium
j viate of Garrett, Morley, and Stein
berg who are also currently tops in
! the PCC.
It looks like an easy Cardinal vic
tory, but the mental situation finds
I the Spartans in the most advantag
i eons position. "We're going nowhere.
I Why not knock off a possible bowl
I entry to make our season a suc
cess?"
The San Jose State Spartans,
from down the road a piece, and
the resurgent forces of Garrett
and Co. will settle down to their
annual "Backyard Champion
ship" battle tomorrow at 2 p.m.
in the Stanford Bowl.
So far, the big bullies from Palo
Alto have won all ten of their neigh
borhood scraps.
The San Joseans are expected to
be "up" for their bid for national
prominence and a chance to upset u
potential Rose Bowl entry.
However, contrary to popular
opinion, the Indians will not be
unaware of San Jose and looking
forward to the big one against the
Bears; a decisive victory over the
junior Trojans is a necessity for
four reasons:
1. The Indians want to perpetuate
their undefeated record against the
Spartans. They want no part of an
upset to ruin their 1.000 record.
2. So far this season the Card:,
have dropped two tilts to outside op
ponents, COP and Illinois. They
need a win over a non-conference
team to enhance their position when
the Rose Bowl bid is being decided
between the Bruins and the Indians.
15. Passing wizard Bobby Gar
rett, who is currently leading the.
nation's passers, needs a good day
against the undermanned San Jose
secondary to solidify his position.
4. To the coach, this would be an
excellent opportunity to develop
some reserves to offset Pappy Wal
dorf's "deep freeze," which has been,
one of the reasons for Stanford's in
adequacy in the Big Game.
Coach Chuck Taylor should have
little trouble making these reason .

who have had to rise to the threi:
consecutive crucials in a matter o£

their full complement with only

feat despite the loss of Joe Ulm who
was leading the nation in running
after four games, before he was de
clared ineligible along with three
other starters.
The Spartans and the Cardinals
are similar on pass defense having
given up 756 and 764 yards respect-
I ively.
In the stop department, the In
dians are way in front of their
; Santa Clara Valley neighbors. The
locals have yielded only 1437 yards
while the Spartans have been run
through for 1774 yards.
For obvious reasons, the Santa
I Clarans have been working on pass
j defense to stop the passing trium
j viate of Garrett, Morley, and Stein
berg who are also currently tops in
! the PCC.
It looks like an easy Cardinal vic
tory, but the mental situation finds
I the Spartans in the most advantag
i eons position. "We're going nowhere.
I Why not knock off a possible bowl
I entry to make our season a suc
cess?"
The San Jose State Spartans,
from down the road a piece, and
the resurgent forces of Garrett
and Co. will settle down to their
annual "Backyard Champion
ship" battle tomorrow at 2 p.m.
in the Stanford Bowl.
So far, the big bullies from Palo
Alto have won all ten of their neigh
borhood scraps.
The San Joseans are expected to
be "up" for their bid for national
prominence and a chance to upset u
potential Rose Bowl entry.
However, contrary to popular
opinion, the Indians will not be
unaware of San Jose and looking
forward to the big one against the
Bears; a decisive victory over the
junior Trojans is a necessity for
four reasons:
1. The Indians want to perpetuate
their undefeated record against the
Spartans. They want no part of an
upset to ruin their 1.000 record.
2. So far this season the Card:,
have dropped two tilts to outside op
ponents, COP and Illinois. They
need a win over a non-conference
team to enhance their position when
the Rose Bowl bid is being decided
between the Bruins and the Indians.
15. Passing wizard Bobby Gar
rett, who is currently leading the.
nation's passers, needs a good day
against the undermanned San Jose
secondary to solidify his position.
4. To the coach, this would be an
excellent opportunity to develop
some reserves to offset Pappy Wal
dorf's "deep freeze," which has been,
one of the reasons for Stanford's in
adequacy in the Big Game.
Coach Chuck Taylor should have
little trouble making these reason .
apparent to his band of gridder.s,
who have had to rise to the threi:
consecutive crucials in a matter o£
four weekends.
Physically, the Indians are at
their full complement with only
Win Wedge with a knee injury as
a doubtful starter. Sam Morlev
may join Wedge if his injured
hand doesn't respond to treatment.
They will be ready for the Big
Game.
The Spartans, coached by affable
Bob Bronzan have improved in their
last two efforts. They played a rut.y
gcd North Texas State squad to
tic and beat the unpredictable COP
Tigers.
Bronzan has a sharp running full
back in Jerry Taylor, plus break
away speed in Larry Matthews and
a cagey field general in quarterha< k
Larry Rice. The defensively minded
coach has molded a rugged line that,
played on more than equal term .
for three quarters with the burly
Bear forwards.
Unlike last season when the
Spartans were awed to a 35-111 de
feat in the 90,000 capacity Stanford
stadium, they have played two
good battles in the California and
Portland bowls. They'll have llieii
mouths closed tomorrow.
Most experts arc hoping to ;<
battle between teams who ulili/"
two extreme phases of offensive
football as their means to gain the
enemy end zone. They will each
feature the pass against the run.
A look at the statistics shows both
squads have almost similar overafl
season marks (SJS 4-3-1; Stanford
5-3).
In the passing department the
Indians have an obvious advantage
with phenomenal Bob Garrett's
radar arm hitting for 100 passes in
17(» attempts for 1448 yards and 11
six-pointers. San Jose State, in
this department, rates puny in
comparison, having only 41 recep
tions in 07 tries for 624 yards and
one touchdown. Stanford's per
| centage is .568, San Jose's .42.'?.
Paradoxically, San Jose is as
strong in the ground game as Stan
ford is in the air. The Spartans have
charged in 393 blasts for 1814 yards,
• while the Indians have run the ball
353 times for only 1155 yards. The
