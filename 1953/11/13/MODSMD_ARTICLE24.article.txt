FORT ORD, Nov. 12—The most common of all basic
trainm;*; mishaps pneumonia — caught up with me
just :ts USC was catching up with Stanford.
To get into the hospital is a task in itself. First
you must turn in all your equipment, then report
for sick call at 7 a.m. Then if you have sufficient

temperature you are taken to
the dispensary where a doctor
makes a hurried diagnosis and
you are taken to the hospital
where receiving lines are long
and slow. After starting out at
0700, I was in bed at 11:15 a.m.
it's ai long wait with 102 tem
perature. Never complain
about the Health Service again.

Earlier this week we attended

»-U:..se:;, covering all types of subjects, intelligence,
hist aid, military courtesy, the use of the rifle, and
many, many more.
An entire company, !500 men, attend a class together,
and some <>£ the instructors are excellent, while oth
er:. seem more like circus barkers.
The one remark which has stuck with me more
than any other was the one, "We are teaching you

to be professional killers."

I was on KP the other day and it is just as hard I
and tough as all the stories about it.
At Thursday evening I reported 1 o the
kitchen to he taught the ropes by the KP's who
were on that day—got off at 10 that night, then
when you go to bed you tie a towel to the foot of
your bed and at :» a.m. a messenger comes to awa- !
ken you and from 7 a.m. to 10 that night you're
working in the kitchen—and it's a long day espe- !
cially for the 11 Mi cents you're making an hour, as
your pay figures out to be.

There's a term in the Army—"Gung Ho," and it's
an adjective. When they say he's Gung Ho, it's the
same as saying he's rah-rah or full of college spirit.
Few draftees are so described. The draftees for the
most part are here with one thought in mind—to get |
those two years out of the way—nothing more and !
if possible something less.
A word of advice: i! you have the Army in front,
of you, get your teeth attended to before coming in.
If you have bad cavities which require much work
the Army doesn't bother with them. They just pull
the tooth.

I was on KP the other day and it is just as hard I
and tough as all the stories about it.
At Thursday evening I reported 1 o the
kitchen to he taught the ropes by the KP's who
were on that day—got off at 10 that night, then
when you go to bed you tie a towel to the foot of
your bed and at :» a.m. a messenger comes to awa- !
ken you and from 7 a.m. to 10 that night you're
working in the kitchen—and it's a long day espe- !
cially for the 11 Mi cents you're making an hour, as
your pay figures out to be.

There's a term in the Army—"Gung Ho," and it's
an adjective. When they say he's Gung Ho, it's the
same as saying he's rah-rah or full of college spirit.
Few draftees are so described. The draftees for the
most part are here with one thought in mind—to get |
those two years out of the way—nothing more and !
if possible something less.
A word of advice: i! you have the Army in front,
of you, get your teeth attended to before coming in.
If you have bad cavities which require much work
the Army doesn't bother with them. They just pull
the tooth.

FORT ORD, Nov. 12—The most common of all basic
trainm;*; mishaps pneumonia — caught up with me
just :ts USC was catching up with Stanford.
To get into the hospital is a task in itself. First
you must turn in all your equipment, then report
for sick call at 7 a.m. Then if you have sufficient

temperature you are taken to
the dispensary where a doctor
makes a hurried diagnosis and
you are taken to the hospital
where receiving lines are long
and slow. After starting out at
0700, I was in bed at 11:15 a.m.
it's ai long wait with 102 tem
perature. Never complain
about the Health Service again.

The one remark which has stuck with me more
than any other was the one, "We are teaching you

to be professional killers."
