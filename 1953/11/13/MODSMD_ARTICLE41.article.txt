We've been keeping our ear to the ground all week to try and get the
campus opinion on the upcoming grid titanic with San Jose State. Aside
from finding a few usable cigarette butts, nothing was accomplished by
this action.
Everybody's looking over the Spartans to Cal. And that could he the
hip' mistake of the rear. Of course, comparative point scores mean next

to nothing, but look at this one: Oregon heat San Jose
by the same number of points that they beat CSC.
At this point in the season the Spartans have won four
games—over Idaho. Brigham Young, Fresno State, and
COP; tied one, with North Texas State; and lost three,
to Arizona State. California, and Oregon.
After four weeks ot the season, when they were sport
ing a three and one record, San Jose lost four men on
an ineligibility ruling, including the NCAA rushing and
scoring leader, Joe Ulm. '
The Spartans, ably coached by Bob Bronzan, have re
bounded from what could have been a crippling blow.

however; in tneir last two games they've tied with a good North Texas State
ball club and beaten College of Pacific (COP beat us, remember).
Bronzan's got a big fullback, Jerry Taylor, a sharp running halfback
in Larry Matthews, a smart quarterback. Larry Ilice, and a line that was
good enough to play even with Cal's forwards for three quarters.
And the Spartans' "big stadium jinx" should be all worn oIT by now
after playing at Portland and at Berkeley.
So don't get complacent and forget to show up for the ball game Saturday;
it could be a good one.
