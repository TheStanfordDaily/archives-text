# Champion Card Tankmen Host Cal Tomorrow
## 
### DON STEPHENS 
The Stanford water polo team will
be out to prove itself a worthy
conference champion when the
Cards meet the pre-season favorites,
Cal's Golden Bears, tomorrow at 10
a.m. in the Encina pool.
The Papoose and Cub squads will
clash following the varsity en
counter.
Dumped by the Indians, 4-3, in
the opener, the Bears were upset by
the Trojans two weeks ago in the
Southland to fall out of title con
tention. Figuring both teams to go
undefeated following their opener,
the dopesters called tomorrow's con
test the crucial. But the contest will
be a replay of their exciting opener
in which the Indians overcame a
three goal deficit at the beginning
of the fourth quartet' to win.
However, reports from Berkeley
indicate that the Bears will be out
to show that they would be as wor
thy of the crown as the Cardinals.
Cal has the best three guards in the
conference in Dick Kamler, Don
Smalian, and Jim Ross. The trio
should make all-conference honors.
The Indians also have a potential
all-conference trio in forwards Ir
win Johnson, Jim Gaughran, and
Jim Lee.
Dave Murton, who has developed
into a top-notch goalie, if not an
all-conference nominee, is the key
to an Indian victory.
If he can hold the mediocre Cal
ifornia forwards to a few goals, the
high-scoring Indians should dump
through their usual six goals to gar
ner the victory despite the rugged
Bruin guards.
