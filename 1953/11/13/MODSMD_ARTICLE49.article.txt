# Morley's Spectacular SC Play Earns Daily Award
## 
### VIC CASEBOLT 
I "Two of the greatest catches I've ever seen"—that is what foot
ball experts who witnessed the Stanford-SC tussle last weekend
are saying about Sam Morley's sterling performance in the Los
Angeles Coliseum, which earned him The Daily's "Athlete of the !
Week" award.
Morley, half of the renowned Stanford duo from near-by San j

Marino, turned in a superb pass
catching performance and clearly
demonstrated that he is a leading
candidate tor All - American end
honors.
"When they start picking All—
i Americans," says Stanford Coach
I Chuck Taylor, "they should consid
er Morley. He ranks with Bill Mc-
Coll and John Steinberg as one of
Stanford's three greatest receivers."
' Morley was also chosen on this
week's "Line of the Week - ' by the
United Press.
Last Saturday's performance
boosted Morley's reception total to
35 this season, and his career total
' to 103, with two games yet to go.

The 103 mark already ranks as one
of the best records of major college
ends, and the next two games might
well boost him over the top as all
time leader.
Also a basketball star at South
Pasadena High School, Sam has
certainly proved his prep coach
right, who said at graduation time
that it would be football where Sam
would really make a name for him
self in college.
One of his outstanding catches in
Saturday's game came in the third
quarter, when Sam grabbed an ae
rial out of the stratosphere that
fans were sure wouldn't touch his
finger-tips. The play went for 39
yards. The other eye-opener was,
in the words of the Daily Trojan,
"an unbelievable diving catch,"
inches from the ground, which put
Stanford ahead, 20-l'3.
On the campus, Sam is an out
standing student, and plans to go to
law school following graduation. He
is a member of Zeta Psi fraternity.
