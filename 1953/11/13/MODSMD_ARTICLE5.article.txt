# Mrs. FDR Urges Study Of Language
## 
### JERRY SIMPSON 
Speaking before the represen
tatives of the Collegiate Council
for the United Nations in San
Francisco last night, Mrs. Frank
lin D. Roosevelt declared that
the best way for students to fur
ther the cause of world peace
and the promotion of interna
tional good will was for students
to learn other languages.
Mrs. Roosevelt is a member of the
executive board of the American As
sociation for the United Nations. Her
address last night was one of several
which she is giving in San Francisco
this week.
Symbol of Friendship
"When we visit other countries,"
she said, "it is much nicer to be able
to speak a few words in the native
language and to know something of
the nation's problems and its inter
ests. Any attempt to learn the lan
guage is a symbol of friendship; it
shows we are interested."
Wearing a colorful cloak woven
with golden threads, Mrs. Roosevelt
entered the dining room amid a
standing ovation. The cloak was a
gift of the Women's Club of Paki
stan to Mrs. Roosevelt when she vis
ited that country recently.
She continued her explanation of
the language barrier by saying that
if our students before traveling
would take stock of the problems of
our nation on the international scene
and have some answer to questions
about our foreign policies, our pres
tige would be greatly increased.
Moreover, the peoples of Europe and
Asia would gain a little better insight
into the puzzling affairs of our gov
ernment. This insight, she said,
would be of inestimable value in
creating good will.
Korean Situation
Following her main speech, Mrs.
Roosevelt threw the meeting open to
questions from the audience. In
reply to a query concerning the ou
comc of the Korean situation, she
said, "I don't think we can really
predict what the outcome will be."
She said she believed the U.S. will
win peace, but added, "I'm afraid it
will not be a permanent one."
"We must discuss all of the prob
lems confronting Asia and do some
thing constructive in settling them.
We cannot expect a permanent basis
for peace when we have settled only
one part of the over-all problem.
The Korean situation is only one part
of the many problems confronting
the Asian peoples."
Mrs. Roosevelt concluded by say
ing she was indeed proud to be
working with the young people of
this nation who arc doing their bit
for a better world in which to live.
As she left the room, the students
again stood, clapping until she had
disappeared through the exit.

Following her main speech, Mrs.
Roosevelt threw the meeting open to
questions from the audience. In
reply to a query concerning the ou
comc of the Korean situation, she
said, "I don't think we can really
predict what the outcome will be."
She said she believed the U.S. will
win peace, but added, "I'm afraid it
will not be a permanent one."
"We must discuss all of the prob
lems confronting Asia and do some
thing constructive in settling them.
We cannot expect a permanent basis
for peace when we have settled only
one part of the over-all problem.
The Korean situation is only one part
of the many problems confronting
the Asian peoples."
Mrs. Roosevelt concluded by say
ing she was indeed proud to be
working with the young people of
this nation who arc doing their bit
for a better world in which to live.
As she left the room, the students
again stood, clapping until she had
disappeared through the exit.
Speaking before the represen
tatives of the Collegiate Council
for the United Nations in San
Francisco last night, Mrs. Frank
lin D. Roosevelt declared that
the best way for students to fur
ther the cause of world peace
and the promotion of interna
tional good will was for students
to learn other languages.
Mrs. Roosevelt is a member of the
executive board of the American As
sociation for the United Nations. Her
address last night was one of several
which she is giving in San Francisco
this week.
Symbol of Friendship
"When we visit other countries,"
she said, "it is much nicer to be able
to speak a few words in the native
language and to know something of
the nation's problems and its inter
ests. Any attempt to learn the lan
guage is a symbol of friendship; it
shows we are interested."
Wearing a colorful cloak woven
with golden threads, Mrs. Roosevelt
entered the dining room amid a
standing ovation. The cloak was a
gift of the Women's Club of Paki
stan to Mrs. Roosevelt when she vis
ited that country recently.
She continued her explanation of
the language barrier by saying that
if our students before traveling
would take stock of the problems of
our nation on the international scene
and have some answer to questions
about our foreign policies, our pres
tige would be greatly increased.
Moreover, the peoples of Europe and
Asia would gain a little better insight
into the puzzling affairs of our gov
ernment. This insight, she said,
would be of inestimable value in
creating good will.
