Stanford's freshman footballers
swing into combat tomorrow in
Berkeley at 11 a.m. to even the
score with the California Cubs and
Ronnie Knox, their aerial-minded j
quarterback.
Cal came from behind to trip the
Papooses on three touchdown passes !
by Knox, 19-12, in Stanford's only
start of the season two weeks ago. 1
Tomorrow the Papoose defense:
will attempt to put more pressure :
on the highly touted Cal thrower }
than it did previously, Coach Bob
Ghilotti said, with constant rush- 1
ing tactics and by tightening up the !
defensive secondary.
Ghilotti expects an even better j
| game from the frosh than two
j weeks ago when they outplayed Cal j
| in the first half before succumbing
I to Knox's passes after the intermis
| sion.
"We're certainly ready for them," j
| Ghilotti said. "Everyone is in good
health, condition has improved al
though we really don't have much 1
i time to get in top shape, and we j
have better teamwork now.
"I hope it doesn't rain though it
might help us. We've been working
| on our passing a little, too.
"However, we will stress our run
ning game."
Ghilotti announced a few changes
in the starting lineup, but indicated
I that the top 22 men will see a lot of
| action.

Jim Noe, who led Stanford backs i
with a 6.9 average in the Cal game,
will be the chief running threat I
from his right halfback slot.
Mike Raftery, small speedster
from Inglewood, will open at the
other half. Hank Rolden, Jack
Groat, and Gordon Young are also
expected to break into the Papoose
backfield.
Paul Camera from St. Ignatius
High in San Francisco gets the
starting quarterback call, but he'll
alternate with John Brodie, who
bootlegged for the second TD
against Cal.
Ron Pataky will replace Tony
Serra at fullback on the starting
eleven.
The Papooses' fast, hard-charging
line is bolstered by Don Manoukian,
Donn Carswell, Bob Gergen, and
Tom Kemp.

Ronnie Knox, their aerial-minded j
quarterback.
Cal came from behind to trip the
Papooses on three touchdown passes !
by Knox, 19-12, in Stanford's only
start of the season two weeks ago. 1
Tomorrow the Papoose defense:
will attempt to put more pressure :
on the highly touted Cal thrower }
than it did previously, Coach Bob
Ghilotti said, with constant rush- 1
ing tactics and by tightening up the !
defensive secondary.
Ghilotti expects an even better j
| game from the frosh than two
j weeks ago when they outplayed Cal j
| in the first half before succumbing
I to Knox's passes after the intermis
| sion.
"We're certainly ready for them," j
| Ghilotti said. "Everyone is in good
health, condition has improved al
though we really don't have much 1
i time to get in top shape, and we j
have better teamwork now.
"I hope it doesn't rain though it
might help us. We've been working
| on our passing a little, too.
"However, we will stress our run
ning game."
Ghilotti announced a few changes
in the starting lineup, but indicated
I that the top 22 men will see a lot of
| action.

Jim Noe, who led Stanford backs i
with a 6.9 average in the Cal game,
will be the chief running threat I
from his right halfback slot.
Mike Raftery, small speedster
from Inglewood, will open at the
other half. Hank Rolden, Jack
Groat, and Gordon Young are also
expected to break into the Papoose
backfield.
Paul Camera from St. Ignatius
High in San Francisco gets the
starting quarterback call, but he'll
alternate with John Brodie, who
bootlegged for the second TD
against Cal.
Ron Pataky will replace Tony
Serra at fullback on the starting
eleven.
The Papooses' fast, hard-charging
line is bolstered by Don Manoukian,
Donn Carswell, Bob Gergen, and
Tom Kemp.
