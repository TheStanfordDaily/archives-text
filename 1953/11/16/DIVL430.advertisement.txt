"Your hair'* no yoko" bellowed Sheedy's gal. "Those cowlicks look awful.
Why not take the bull by the horns and get yourself some Wildroot
Cream-Oil, America's favorite hair tonic? Keeps hair combed without
greasiness. Makes you look cud-dly. Removes loose, ugly
dandruff. Relieves annoying dryness. Contains Lanolin. H
Non-alcoholic. I won't cow-tow 'til you start using it \x x /
heifery day." Paul was udderly stunned, so he bought
some Wildroot Cream-Oil for just 29f. He told his girl
the good moos and now they're hitched for life. So just
steer yourself down to any toilet goods counter for a 1
bottle or handy tube. And remember to ox your barber momTwhuiil'" *j
for Wildroot Cream-Oil too. You'll be the cream of »iiumw«m M
the campus—and that's no bull.
