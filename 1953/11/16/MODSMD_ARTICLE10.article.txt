A trio of accidents involving Stan- |

weekend, two on E! Camino and the
third on Palm Drive.
Senior Don Stephens and law stu
dent Martin Cohan were slightly in
jured early Saturday morning on
Palm Drive. Stevens swerved his
car into a lamppost, while blinded
because the driver of a car passing
in the opposite direction failed to
dim his lights.
Ventura senior Alice Pink was
shaken up Saturday afternoon after
the football game in a two-car col
lision at El Camino and Alma Street.
Her car was struck as it was cross
ing the highway by a car driven by
Thomas Spencer, 1050 Susan Way,
Sunnyvale. Spencer suffered a slight
cut.
A car driven by Donald Brewer,
Stanford senior, crashed into a
stalled car on Bayshore early Sun
day morning, and moved it 140 feet.
Neither Brewer and his passenger,
Stanford student Joyce Macconel.
nor the two' women in the stalled
car, Sonya Hoisath of Redwood City
and Dorothy Ericson of Menlo Park,
were hurt.
