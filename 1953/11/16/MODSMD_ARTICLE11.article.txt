## Truman Preparing Broadcast Tonight To Tell Public His Side of White Case 
### United Press 
Former President Harry S.
Truman returned home yester
day to prepare a speech for
broadcast tonight which close
associates have said will tell
how Harry Dexter White was
kept under close watch while
in the government for any spy
activity.
Mr. Truman's radio - television
speech at 9 p.m., PST, over all
major networks will be to answer
charges by Attorney General Her
bert Brownell, Jr., that Mr. Truman
"promoted" White from the Treas
ury Department to the Internation
al Monetary Fund in the face of FBI
reports that White was a Commu
nist spy.
"We've got a lot of things to
do," he told newsmen when he
got off his train. "I can't answer
your questions now. I will an
swer them tomorrow nightâ€”those
that can be answered."
Mr. Truman dismissed all ques
tions pertaining to the political con
troversy after stating he wouldn't
consider his spcech a "political"
one.
Meanwhile, it was disclosed that
the Senate Internal Security sub
committee will seek the advice of
Attorney General Brownell before
dciding whether to call FBI Direc
tor J. Edgar Hoover to testify in the
White "spy" case.
Subcommittee Counsel Robert
Morris said Chairman William E.
Jenner will leave it to a full sub
committee vote whether to "in
vite" Mr. Truman to testify after
the former chief executive gives
his "all-out" report on the case
tonight.
Leaders of both parties will be |

watching closely because of future
political implications of Truman's
speech.
GOP National Chairman Leonard
W. Hall said Communism will be
"one of the main issues" of the
1954 Congressional campaign. He
said the Republican administration
"will sec to it that all those security
risks . . . who came in under the
old administration are going to be
put out." Hall also said that Brown
ell "has supporting evidence for
everything he has said" about the
White case.
Democratic National Chairman
Stephen A. Mitchell said he believes
Brownell "exaggerated, distorted or
wrongly evaluated" FBI reports on
White. He said if Browncll's ver
sion is correct, Hoover "would have
resigned instead of letting a flock of
Communists run loose."
