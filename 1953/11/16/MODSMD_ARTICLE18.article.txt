# Garrett Breaks Passing Record As Cards Win Big Game Prep
## Spartans Collapse In Stadium, 54-0 
### DON STEPHENS 
The Stanford footballer:,
served an ominous notice to
their Big Game rivals, the Gold
en Bears, as they swamped a
jinxed San Jose State team,
54-0 Saturday before 12,000 ram
defying fans.
It was San Jose's eleventh con
secutive defeat at the hands of the
Indians in Stanford Stadium, when
the Spartans have always been awed.
The game, the season finale for the
Spartans, looked like the beginning
of a means to ending the seven-year
Big Game win drought for the In
dians. Stanford turned a heretofore
nebulous ground game into such a
formidable offensive weapon that
most experts feel the Bears will
have a difficult time in stacking
their defense against Bob Garrett'j
aerial thrusts.
The Indians' 349 yards and three
TDs gained rushing, prompted Cal
scout Zeb Chancy to say:
"Stanford's running was 60 per
cent better than last week—and I
make that comparison while ad
mitting USC naturally had more
defense than Sarr Jose. And Stan
ford is playing it right—just the
opposite from most college teams,
more like the pros. They open you
up the easy way with passes and
then they run."
With Bob Garrett at the helm, the
Indians hit 14 out of 20 pass attempt.;
for 146 yards gained and three
touchdowns. Garrett was credited
with his 14th, 15th, and 16th touch
down passes, breaking WSC's Bob
Burkhart's PCC record of 15 set in
in 1951. His season total rose to 106
pass completions in 178 attempts for
1,506 yards.
When asked about Stanford's
aerial display Chaney declared,
"Stanford's passing was at least
the equal of the passing it threw at
USC."
"Garrett is the best passer 1 havo
seen in a long time," Chaney con
tinued. "He's as good as Sammy
Baugh or Dixie Howell. Garrett is
more consistent with Morley, Stein
berg, and Cook than Howell was
with Hutson. Garrett's throws arc
hard to cover. He'll complete theru
against any opponent. He throw. 1 ;
them fast or slow, short or long, and
fakes them short and throws them
long."
"Furthermore, add this kid Marv
Tennefoss to the picture as a great
Stanford receiver. Those two recep
tions from Garrett and Gebcrl
showed aggressive, hcads-up ball,"
Chaney concluded.
After the Indians notched their
ninth consccutivc 7-ft first-quar
ter lead on an cight-yarder from
Garrett to Morley early in (In
game, an omnipotent scoring dis
play prevailed. And not even Hie
likes of merciful Churk Taylor
could stem the tide which saw
even reserves and junior varsity
members scoring touchdowns.
The scoring:
1. An eight-yard pass from Gai -
rett to Morley early in the first
quarter climaxed a 47-yard drive.
2. To culminate an 86 - yard
March, Jarvis Watson crashed
through right guard for one yard
and the score.
Garrett threw a 10-yardcr to
Tennefoss, who caught the pass
among three San Jose defenders
on the one-yard line and fell inlo
the end zone. End John Stewart's
interception of a screen pass on
the San Jose 12 set up the Tl).
4. A 30-yarder from Garrett to
Ron Cook in the end zone gave
Garrett the new PCC mark.
5. Joe Moreau ran an intercepted
Spartan pass 21 yards.
6. Gcbcrt pitched .*{(» yards

for the tally.
8. Finally, Dick Monteith took a
one-yard dive across the middle of
the Spartan line after a 54-yard ad
! vance.
In between Stanford's touch
downs, the Spartans couldn't do
anything right, and when they did
start to move, an interception, a
fumble, or a defesnive stand frus
trated the drive.
San Jose's deepest penetration
came in the first period when it
I drove from its own 20 to the Car-
I dinal eight - yard line only to be

The Stanford footballer:,
served an ominous notice to
their Big Game rivals, the Gold

jinxed San Jose State team,
54-0 Saturday before 12,000 ram
defying fans.
It was San Jose's eleventh con
secutive defeat at the hands of the
Indians in Stanford Stadium, when
the Spartans have always been awed.
The game, the season finale for the
Spartans, looked like the beginning
of a means to ending the seven-year
Big Game win drought for the In
dians. Stanford turned a heretofore
nebulous ground game into such a
formidable offensive weapon that
most experts feel the Bears will
have a difficult time in stacking
their defense against Bob Garrett'j
aerial thrusts.
The Indians' 349 yards and three
TDs gained rushing, prompted Cal
scout Zeb Chancy to say:
"Stanford's running was 60 per
cent better than last week—and I
make that comparison while ad
mitting USC naturally had more
defense than Sarr Jose. And Stan
ford is playing it right—just the
opposite from most college teams,
more like the pros. They open you
up the easy way with passes and
then they run."
With Bob Garrett at the helm, the
Indians hit 14 out of 20 pass attempt.;
for 146 yards gained and three
touchdowns. Garrett was credited
with his 14th, 15th, and 16th touch
down passes, breaking WSC's Bob
Burkhart's PCC record of 15 set in
in 1951. His season total rose to 106
pass completions in 178 attempts for
1,506 yards.
When asked about Stanford's
aerial display Chaney declared,
"Stanford's passing was at least
the equal of the passing it threw at
USC."
"Garrett is the best passer 1 havo
seen in a long time," Chaney con
tinued. "He's as good as Sammy
Baugh or Dixie Howell. Garrett is
more consistent with Morley, Stein
berg, and Cook than Howell was
with Hutson. Garrett's throws arc
hard to cover. He'll complete theru
against any opponent. He throw. 1 ;
them fast or slow, short or long, and
fakes them short and throws them
long."
"Furthermore, add this kid Marv
Tennefoss to the picture as a great
Stanford receiver. Those two recep
tions from Garrett and Gebcrl
showed aggressive, hcads-up ball,"
Chaney concluded.

defying fans.
It was San Jose's eleventh con
secutive defeat at the hands of the
Indians in Stanford Stadium, when
the Spartans have always been awed.
The game, the season finale for the
Spartans, looked like the beginning
of a means to ending the seven-year
Big Game win drought for the In
dians. Stanford turned a heretofore
nebulous ground game into such a
formidable offensive weapon that
most experts feel the Bears will
have a difficult time in stacking
their defense against Bob Garrett'j
aerial thrusts.
The Indians' 349 yards and three
TDs gained rushing, prompted Cal
scout Zeb Chancy to say:
"Stanford's running was 60 per
cent better than last week—and I
make that comparison while ad
mitting USC naturally had more
defense than Sarr Jose. And Stan
ford is playing it right—just the
opposite from most college teams,
more like the pros. They open you
up the easy way with passes and
then they run."
With Bob Garrett at the helm, the
Indians hit 14 out of 20 pass attempt.;
for 146 yards gained and three
touchdowns. Garrett was credited
with his 14th, 15th, and 16th touch
down passes, breaking WSC's Bob
Burkhart's PCC record of 15 set in
in 1951. His season total rose to 106
pass completions in 178 attempts for
1,506 yards.
When asked about Stanford's
aerial display Chaney declared,
"Stanford's passing was at least
the equal of the passing it threw at
USC."
"Garrett is the best passer 1 havo
seen in a long time," Chaney con
tinued. "He's as good as Sammy
Baugh or Dixie Howell. Garrett is
more consistent with Morley, Stein
berg, and Cook than Howell was
with Hutson. Garrett's throws arc
hard to cover. He'll complete theru
against any opponent. He throw. 1 ;
them fast or slow, short or long, and
fakes them short and throws them
long."
"Furthermore, add this kid Marv
Tennefoss to the picture as a great
Stanford receiver. Those two recep
tions from Garrett and Gebcrl
showed aggressive, hcads-up ball,"
Chaney concluded.
After the Indians notched their
ninth consccutivc 7-ft first-quar
ter lead on an cight-yarder from
Garrett to Morley early in (In
game, an omnipotent scoring dis
play prevailed. And not even Hie
likes of merciful Churk Taylor
could stem the tide which saw
even reserves and junior varsity
members scoring touchdowns.
The scoring:
1. An eight-yard pass from Gai -
rett to Morley early in the first
quarter climaxed a 47-yard drive.
2. To culminate an 86 - yard
March, Jarvis Watson crashed
through right guard for one yard
and the score.
Garrett threw a 10-yardcr to
Tennefoss, who caught the pass
among three San Jose defenders
on the one-yard line and fell inlo
the end zone. End John Stewart's
interception of a screen pass on
the San Jose 12 set up the Tl).
4. A 30-yarder from Garrett to
Ron Cook in the end zone gave
Garrett the new PCC mark.

Spartan pass 21 yards.

8. Finally, Dick Monteith took a

In between Stanford's touch
downs, the Spartans couldn't do
anything right, and when they did
start to move, an interception, a
