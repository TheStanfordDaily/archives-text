# BULL SESSION
## 
### DICK MANSFIELD 
Up at the lota Psi house the boys were having some
high jinkies. The lights were flashing on and off, the
house was rocking slowly back and forth on its foun
dations, and all over the campus there was a rumble

as of thunder. Down in Palo Alto
mothers called their children in
off the streets and fathers began
putting on the storm windows.
Jt looked like a long night.
Up to the front door of the lota
Pi house strode a stranger clad
all in black, wearing a tall hat
and gloves. Presently a brother
opened the door. "Yair," he said.
"I," said the stranger, "am Gar
finkle, of- the P-TA!" And he

drew back his cloak to disclose a large badge and a
bunch of flowers thrust into a shoulder holster. "I
understand that you are having a party here."
"Na," said the brother. "We're just having a chapter
meeting. TÂ°P secret stuff, you know. Real hush-hush!"
"Nevertheless," said Garfinkle, squaring his shoul
der.;, "my mission of purity and cleanliness demands
that I find out what kind of a conclave you are spon
: oring." And he marched past the doorkeeper.
"Are you a brother?" said the doorkeeper, and
tried applying th" fraternity grip, but Garfinkle knew
a little jiu-jitsu himself, and soon burst into the chap
ter room,
A scene of darkest sin met his eye. The brothers
sat in a circle on the floor, and in the circle was the
tong president. He was rolling loaded dice for the

amusement and edification of his fellaws. Some were
taking notes. Others slept. But all occasionally.paused
to sing raucous songs or tell vile jokes.
"A clandestine gathering!" cried Garfinkle, and
stepped into the circle. Opening his Special Handbook
for Special Agents of the P-TA, he read certain in
spirational selections.
"Look here, Garfinkle," said the president. "To
show you that we fraternity men are on the level,
we'll give you a square deal. Did you ever play a
game with these before?" He held up the dice.
"Never," said Garfinkle, looking pious.
"I'll teach you," said the president with a crafty
snicker, "and you can make a pile of money."
Hours later Garfinkle of the P-TA, dejected,
bent, emerged from the lota Psi house. Jovial
brothers wished him bon voyage. They had taken
% every cent on Garfinkle's person, by the use of foul
methods and loaded dice. Garfinkle had sworn that
his only alternative was to hand in his badge. Greek
Row would never again be horrified by the sudden
appearance of Garfinkle of the P-TA, defender of
high ideals and lily-white mores.
But there is a moral! Garfinkle of the P-TA won
out in the end, for when the brothers gathered to
divide their loot, they found that the roll of bills
which Garfinkle had used to redeem himself was
actually a selection of tracts. Black disgrace shrouded
lota Psi for years. And wily Garfinkle, of the P-TA,
had scored another victory in his everlasting battle
for blue laws and the nine o'clock curfew at Stanford.
