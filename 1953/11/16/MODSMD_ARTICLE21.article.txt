# Axe Society—to Correlate Alumni-Student Relations
## 
### EDA MENDELS 
The Stanford Axe is missing,
and Axe Society is not looking
for it. Fifteen years ago that
would have been its main con
cern, but today's reorganized
Axe Society stresses alumni re
lations.
Organized in 1936 to channel con
tructively the student enthusiasm
for the Axe and other Stanford tra
dition.-, the present Axe Society has
a wider scope as iiaison between
I).'' Alumni Association and the stu
dent's.
Through its committees Axe So
ciety carries on such activities as
orgupizing regional clubs, guiding
c.'mpus tours, interesting high
eho'ol students in Stanford, and
helping professional societies on
campus contact alumni in the same
field.
Membership in Axe Society is
limited. The charter states that
the society shall be an "organiza
tion of students who have a sin
cere interest in the welfare of
Stanford." An applicant is easily
admitted to the auxiliary, Axe
Committee, but not given full So
icety status until he has earned
10 points through work on Axe
Society projects.
Occasionally a student is granted
membership without the Committee
apprenticeship in recognition of out
standing service to the University.
Ken Schechter, chairman of the
record - shattering blood drive last
pring, joined the ranks that way.
The real forerunner of Axe Soci
ety was Quad Club, organized in
1906. This was a group of select
senior men which discussed cam
pus issues and was official adviser
to the administration. It was dis
continued in the '30's when it was
lelt to be no longer representative.
In 19.% the Axe Society was or
ganised. Juniors were admitted, and
membership was divided between 15
1) iternity men and 15 eating club
members.
Working together on pre-regis
-Iration, student-faculty field days,
frosh bible, and campaigning for
better janitorial service in men's
dormitories, Axe Society fostered
good relations between the clubs
;ind fraternities. In 1941 the small
number of men students on cam
pus caused dissolution of the club.
It was reorganized in 1952 and a
new charter granted. Both men and
women who have completed two
quarters at Stanford were declared
e igible. The position of link be
tween alumni and students was then
established. Sam Freshman was a
leading force in the reactivation of
t he Axe Society and served as pres
ident for the first two yer s.
This year Tom Hodges holds the
presidency and Joyce Martin is sec
retary. There are ten committees
under them that arrange the Axe
Society functions.
The Regional Clubs program is
headed by Ivan Strauss. He is

president of the Stanford Students
of Illinois, a group organized by
Axe Society last year, and he
hopes to arrange similar clubs for
other states.
Rudy Reich with his Special Proj
ects Committee will plan campus
tours for high school students, an
activity to be arranged in conjunc
tion with the Student Guide Serv
ice. The real work of encouraging
high school students to attend Stan-

ford will be done by Ron Louis and
Pat O'Neill, co-chairmen of the Pre-
Stan ford program.
The all-campus dance, "Supersti
tion Stomp," which Axe Society pre
sented Friday, Nov. 13, after the
rally for the San Jose State game,
was under direction of the Social
Committee, particularly co - chair
men Fred Lane and Andrea Haug.
The Alumni Activity Committee
will hold a reception for alumni
soon. John Woehler is in charge of
it.
The Committee for Investiga
tion and Prevention of Campus
Hazards is working with the Cor
poration Yard, Stanford Police
Department, and University ad
ministration to solve traffic and
health problems. Co - chairmen

Bill Jones and Anne Evans will
investigate student opinion before
taking concrete action.
Other Axe Society committees are
Alumni Tours, Steve Klee; Drives
Co-ordinator, Nancy Stone* Profes
sional Council Co-ordinator, Jim
Sammet; and ASSU Co-ordinators,
Phyllis Birnbaum and Waddy Gar
rett.
These are the committees that or
ganize the Axe Society projects.
They, the third group of leaders
since the Axe Society's reorganiza
tion, carry on the proud tradition
started by Quad Club in 1906.
