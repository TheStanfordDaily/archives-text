# Employment Possibilities For Spring Grads Smaller
## 
### GERRY SMITH 
Stanford seniors may have more trouble than usual trying to
land a job after graduation next spring. According to Placement
Service officials, employment opportunities for college graduates
in many fields may show a considerable drop this year. Some
companies are cutting their demands as much as 30 per cent in
accordance with the slight general

recession.
However, the demand for techni
cal personnel — all types of engi
neers, chemists, physicists, mathe
maticians—is as large as ever, as
are employment opportunities for
non-technical workers such as ac
countants and sales trainees.
The teaching field for both men
and women is still wide open, and
there are unlimited positions for
women as secretaries, retail mer
chants, nurses, and physical ther
apists.
Most companies are still inter
viewing for many types of positions,
but they are hiring fewer new em
ployees and picking these more se
lectively. For instance, General
Electric Company is hiring only 800
men this year, as compared with
1,200 last year.
Students graduating this year, es
pecially in December and March,
who are interested in finding.em
ployment after graduation may reg
ister now at the Placement Service.
Those who register early have a
better chance of getting the jobs
they want.
Students who will enter the
armed services in the near future
may also register, since inter
viewing companies hope to need
men in two or three years and
want to keep in touch with stu
dents as they come out of the
service.
Last year, students about to enter
the service accepted offers of em
ployment for a short while and then
were given a leave of absence, dur
ing which they still received bene
fits from company programs. Oth
ers were aided in vocational orien
tation by talking to prospective em
ployers.
Students may use the Placement
Service both before and after grad
uation.
