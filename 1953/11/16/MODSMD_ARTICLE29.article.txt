# Selections Of Mozart Presented

### BARNEY CHILDS 
Yesterday afternoon's cham
ber music concert presented
several of the lesser works of
Mozaft to a packed house; those
few students who managed to
overcome Sunday afternoon
slothfulness found their time
well spent.
The performance of the Serenade
lor Eight Wind Instruments, K. 388,
suffered principally from ensemble
difficulties. A wind group must have
a "fine edge" ol attack and execu
tion to bring off compositions like
the Serenade.
Turner Bledsoe, first oboe, turned
in the performance that Stanford
audiences are coming to look for
ward to from him. He manages to
approach each particular passage
with maturity and a conception of
I that unity of line that, coupled with
competent technique, presents the
! most the music has to offer.
Stephen Fox brought off the de
! manding tongued bassoon passages
I in the variation - form last move
ment, and Irving Crawford is, for
! tunately for the cause of chamber
music, still able to come down from
; the medical life in San Francisco
and play French horn with gusto
' and precision.
Marilyn Feller, soprano, was ac-
I companied by Newman Powell at
the harpsichord in three songs.
They are unpretentious and charm
ing works, and Miss Feller brought
to them a pure and unforced so
| prano that sometimes convinces
musically by understatement rather
than vibrato-ing the listener into
] submission. The accompaniment
. was sensitive if at times a trifle
studied.
The closing work was the "Sere
nata notturn" for quartet of strings,
| string orchestra, and timpani, K.
| 239. Sandor Salgo led a small string
| orchestra with tact and warmth,
and the resulting sound was im
pressively wholehearted and full.
The soloists are called upon to per
form almost as a "concertino" in a
concerto grosso, and Raymond
Vaugt led them well, playing with
a purity and maturity that set the
pace for the others.
Everett O'Bannon was second
' violin among the soloists; he dem
onstrated a fine ear and more than
adequate technique, and deserves to
:be heard more. Chalmers Smith
| was called upon again as violist,
and George Woodall, although oc
; casionally slightly unsure in intona
tion, was convincing as the bassist.

studied.
The closing work was the "Sere
nata notturn" for quartet of strings,
| string orchestra, and timpani, K.
| 239. Sandor Salgo led a small string
| orchestra with tact and warmth,
and the resulting sound was im
pressively wholehearted and full.
The soloists are called upon to per
form almost as a "concertino" in a
concerto grosso, and Raymond
Vaugt led them well, playing with
a purity and maturity that set the
pace for the others.
Everett O'Bannon was second
' violin among the soloists; he dem
onstrated a fine ear and more than
adequate technique, and deserves to
:be heard more. Chalmers Smith
| was called upon again as violist,
and George Woodall, although oc
; casionally slightly unsure in intona
tion, was convincing as the bassist.
Yesterday afternoon's cham
ber music concert presented
several of the lesser works of
Mozaft to a packed house; those
few students who managed to
overcome Sunday afternoon
slothfulness found their time
well spent.
The performance of the Serenade
lor Eight Wind Instruments, K. 388,
suffered principally from ensemble
difficulties. A wind group must have
a "fine edge" ol attack and execu
tion to bring off compositions like
the Serenade.
Turner Bledsoe, first oboe, turned
in the performance that Stanford
audiences are coming to look for
ward to from him. He manages to
approach each particular passage
with maturity and a conception of
I that unity of line that, coupled with
competent technique, presents the
! most the music has to offer.
Stephen Fox brought off the de
! manding tongued bassoon passages
I in the variation - form last move
ment, and Irving Crawford is, for
! tunately for the cause of chamber
music, still able to come down from
; the medical life in San Francisco
and play French horn with gusto
' and precision.
Marilyn Feller, soprano, was ac-
I companied by Newman Powell at
the harpsichord in three songs.
They are unpretentious and charm
ing works, and Miss Feller brought
to them a pure and unforced so
| prano that sometimes convinces
musically by understatement rather
than vibrato-ing the listener into
] submission. The accompaniment
. was sensitive if at times a trifle
studied.
