# Frosh Follow Roldan To Revenge Over Cal
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Papoose halfback Hank Roldan stole the glory from the fabulously-heralded Ronnie Knox with
a pair of touchdown runs as the Stanford freshmen posted a revenge 19-14 triumph over the
Cal Cubs in the lain and mud at Edwards Field, Berkeley, Saturday.
Roldan ripped eight yards through left tackle with only five minutes remaining, to notch
the winning tally. His other TD was a 38-â€žyard dash on a trap play in the second quarter.
Fleet Jack Groat rambled 48 yards on a double reverse for the Papoose's second score to boost

Stanford to a 13-8 halftime lead. <
The victory for Coach Bob Ghi
lotti's yearling gridders squared ac
counts with the Cal crew which
knocked off Stanford with a .second
half rally two weeks ago, 19-12.
Stanford's Tony Williams set tip
the game-deciding marker by re
covering Jim Cherry's fumble of a
Roldan punt on the Cal 10-yard
line.
Roldan picked up two yards on
first down before cracking over
for the six-pointer on the next
play.
Wet turf and occasional showers
hampered Knox's greatly-feared
passing, but nonetheless the Cal
quarterback completed six of 15
passes for 7.'! yards and one touch
down. Knox also ran for 14 yards
in nine carries, and averaged
4.'i.0 yards punting.
Knox threw Cal to a first period
0-0 lead with a five-yard toss to
Mike White, but Stanford bounced
in front early in the second stanza
on Roldan's first six-pointer.
The lead se-sawed when Cal trap
ped Indian Mike Raftery in the end
zone later in the period for a safety.
Then came Groat's run with
Donn Carswell laying in the key
block, and after the intermission

llt'i-h Jackson put Cal on top again, |
14-13, with a 27-yard tally on a
deep reverse.
But Roldan clinched matters for I
Stanford in the final canto.
Roldan led Papoose ball carriers ;
by gaining 07 yards in 10 cracks at ,
the line. Jackson was Cal's top j
threat with 121 yards on five carries j
including a 64-yard romp which set
up Knox's first period TD pass.
