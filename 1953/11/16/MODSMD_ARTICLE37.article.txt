# Coaches Predict Close Big Game
## 
### VIC CASEBOLT DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
"It should be a whing-ding,
wham-bang Big Game next Sat
urday," said Coach Chuck Tay
lor, following Stanford's trounc
ing of San Jose State in the Stan
ford Stadium last weekend.
"We will go into this Big
Game the best prepared, both
physically and mentally, that we
have been in the three years I've
been here."
Taylor feels that Stanford is in a
position to be mentally "up" for the i
traditional Cal slugfest. "The boys;
wqnt to beat Cal, and they want to I
go to the Rose Bowl," the popular .
coach affirmed. He pointed out that
Stanford hasn't come out on top j
since 1946, and the whole team, es
pecially the seniors, will be going i
all-out to claim their first Big Game
victory.
Taylor thinks the Big Game
will see a lot of scoring this year.
"It's going to take at least four
TD's to beat us," he said. "We
can score three against almost
unbodv in the country." And he
intimated that Larson & Co.
across the Bay were capable of
crossing the goal line too.
Getting back to the game just
completed, Coach Taylor said that
the lop-sided score was certainly
not a true indication of the relative
strength of the two teams. "San
Jose State took a shot early in the
ball game, failed, and proceeded to
fall apart," he said.
Taylor thought that SJS was se
riously hampered by the injury of
their star halfback, Larry Mat
thews, early in the afternoon. "San
Jose State gave us the game in the
early part by their fumbles," the ■
coach said. "We got the breaks and
they didn't."
Taylor thought that SJS did a
good job of covering Stanford's pass
receivers, a task which nobody has
carried out with too much success.
When asked about the contin
ual lack of a consistent Stanford
ground attack, Taylor replied,
"We're not too concerned about
our running game." He feels that
Stanford's main game is via the
air lanes and says that the Cards
will run if the opponents force
them to by dropping back and
making it easy to gain through
• he line. Otherwise, the Cards
will use their passing game.
Halfback Bill Tarr came in for a
J round of praise for his brilliant

running, and the coach described A1
Napoleon as "very flashy while he
was in there."
"We played 41 men — everyone
j suited up—during the game," Tay-
I lor said, "including nearly 30 that
had played the major part of the JV
game. Saturday morning."

"I'm tired of making excuses, j
There just aren't any. Every
time we play up here, we go
completely to pieces."
So spoke Bob Bronzan, per
sonable coach of San Jose's van
guished Spartans, one of the
nicest guys you'd want to meet,
even in the wake of his team's
disastrous performance.
Immediately after the game,
Bronzan was sitting quietly in the
corner of the visiting team's dress
ing room surrounded by only two
or three close personal friends,
when this reporter was the only
one brazen or tactless enough to
approach him:
"You want to talk at all?"
"Sure, but there isn't very much
to talk about. That affair was no
good for San Jose, no good for the
spectators, and I don't think it
helped Stanford much as far as
preparing for Cal is concerned."
"What happened? You're usually
up for this game."
"Yes, we usually are, and we still
lose. This week we weren't even
up. I had to drive the team in prac
tice all week."
"You've played both Cal and
Stanford. Would you venture a
comparison?"
"That's hard to do. We played
football against California.
"However, I'll say one thing.
Stanford's defensive line looked
better than Cal's. On the other
hand, the Bears' offensive blocking
was crisper."
"Would you venture a prediction
on the Big Game?"
"I'm afraid I'll have to call it a
toss-up."
