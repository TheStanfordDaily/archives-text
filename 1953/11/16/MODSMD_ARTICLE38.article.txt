The Stanford soccer team finally
came to life last Saturday, and they
pounded out a 3-0 decision over San
Francisco State on State's water
logged field.
It was the wings who provided all
the Indian scoring.
Left wing Niels Vinding put
Stanford ahead with a second-quar
ter goal, and right wing Dick Koe
nigsberger added two more in the
final period.
Once again Stanford's defense
performed brilliantly. Derek Liec-
Ly, Peter Mack, and John Hannu
sparked the effort which gave goalie
Ken Woods his second shutout of
the season.
Freshman Bill Wren, playing his
first game of the season at center
forward, helped immensely in pro
viding the Indians with that extra
spark.
Coach Leo Weinstein was highly
pleased with the performance and
expressed the team sentiment by
saying, "It was the first time this
year we played like a team."
