# Big Game On TV-Maybe
## 
### 
It is almost certain that this Sat
urday's Big Game between Stan
ford and California will be televised.
This is according to Stanford Ath
letic Director A 1 Mastprs, who is
still awaiting official word from the
National Collegiate Athletic Assoc
iation permitting televising of the
game.
If the game is televised, the Big
Game wilt conflict with the USC
UCLA game telecast from Los An
geles, which is already scheduled
as the NCAA nationwide "Game of
the Week." Station KRON serves
as the "Game of the Week" outlet
for the Bay Area.
Masters said that he expects to
hear from University of Washington
Athletic Director Harvey Cassill
sometime today with the official
word giving Stanford the go-ahead
to televise the game. Cassill is the
West Coast regional representative
for the NCAA television committee.
Under NCAA regulations, a sellout
game may replace the regularly
scheduled telecast in any locality, if
the sponsor is willing.
Masters said that he asked permis
.sion of the NCAA several weeks ago
to have the game televised, but at
the time of the request he speci
fied that he did not want the al
ready scheduled USC - UCLA game
"bumped" from the air in favor of
the Big Game. This means that an
other station besides KRON in the
Bay Area would have to televise the
game.
Masters said that General Motors,
sponsor of the "Game of the Week"
had been offered the first chance at
sponsoring the Big Game, with the
proviso that the USC-UCLA game
be televised also.
If the motor firm declines, Mas
ters said, there is another unnamed
sponsor ready to finance the telecast.
