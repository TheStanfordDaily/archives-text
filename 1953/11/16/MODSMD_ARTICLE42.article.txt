# Pyre Plans Speeded Up
## 
### 
The Class of 1957 speeded up
preparations for this year's Big
Game Bonfire over the weekend,
obtaining a third truck for brush
hauling and intensifying guard duty
at the bonfire site at Lake Lagunita.
Freshman construction crews
have dug flue trenches, set up crib
bing, and started moving heavy
timbers for flooring for the bonfire.
Framework for the fire is composed
of 15 telephone poles, arranged in
a triangle on the lake-bed.
In years past, the Kig Game
Bonfire has been built in two or
three days and nights, with the
use of one ladder and small crews
of freshmen. This year, the Class
of 1957 will inaugurate the "Big
Push" system. Starting at noon
on Wednesday, all freshman men
will pitch in and, working on
three ladders, build the fire in one
concerted effort.
While construction work has gone
forward rapidly, the Class of 1957
has remained wary of possible raids
on the bonfire. Anticipated trouble
over the weekend failed to mate
rialize, but committee spokesmen
point out that vandalism is likely
to increase as the bonfire nears
completion.
Preliminary work at the bon
fire site has been under the di
rection of construction chairman
Paul Bissinger. "Our toughest re
maining problem is raising the
big ladders," Bissinger said, "and
with a little good weather and a
good turnout of frosh, we may be
able to get those up before the
Big Push."
Bonfire chairman Dick Mansfield
emphasized the necessity for a big

turnout of freshmen. "The bonfire
looks good now," Mansfield said,
"but it's still pretty early. We'll
need help from every freshman man
to make the Big Push click."
Freshman coeds will be at the
bonfire to serve coffee to men
working in the Big Push. Coed
chairman Tacy Ann Smith reports
a "good signup" at both Roble and
Branner, and the girls will be able
to serve coffee twice during the
evening.
