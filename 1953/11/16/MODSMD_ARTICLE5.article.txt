# Axe Rumors --No Results

### 
Rumors regarding the location of
the missing Stanford Axe, traditional
symbol of rivalry between the Uni
versity of California and Stanford,
continued to spread throughout the
campus yesterday.
Most students here theorized that
the old blade, which is scheduled to
be presented to the winner of Sat
urday's Big Game, will turn up in
time for the annual clash in either
the Stanford or UC rooting sections.
Other students said they believed
the Axe was still on the UC campus,
despite reports that the Axe is in
custody of a Stanford fraternity.
Still others thought it would turn
up at Thursday night's Big Game
bonfire rally in Lake Lagunita or
at UC's Greek Theater rally this
week.
Greg Englehard, director of stu
dent activities at UC, said it was his
"hunch" that the trophy was taken
by UC students last June. The theft
would have to have been made by
somebody with a fairly good idea of
how to enter Stephens Union where
the Axe had been displayed on the
UC Berkeley campus, he said.
A spokesman for the UC senior
Axe-finding committee, which is
investigating the Axe's "disappear
ance," said it would continue its
search, although it has no new clues
or tips.
