# RUSHING CHANGE
## IFC Policy Discussions Scheduled 
### JOHN McFEE 
The proposed revision of
rushing policy, of which the
most important point is the post
ponement of all rushing to
spring quarter, will be discussed
tonight in fraternity house meet
ings and by the Interclub Coun
cil.
Proposed last Wednesday night
by the Interfratcrnity Council, a
body consisting of all the frater
nity presidents, this rushing revi
sion has been referred to the indi
vidual houses and to the eating
clubs for discussion. A final deci
sion on the matter will be reached
by the IFC Wednesday night.
This decision will not be binding
on the eating clubs, which are ex
pected to consider the proposal fur
ther.
The revision involves three
changes:
1. Postponement of rushing ac
tivities to spring quarter.
2. Elimination of vacation rush
ing.
3. Revision of the actual rush
ing schedule.
A bulletin circulated by the IFC
Saturday to all fraternities and eat
ing clubs brings out many pros and
cons of the proposal. According to
this bulletin the advantages of put
ting off rushing until spring quarter
are:
1. The freshmen would benefit.
Proponents of the new policy point
out that freshmen would be more
settled in school and that they
would know more of what they
want.
As for studying, the bulletin
continues, grades will he more
defined by spring quarter, and
freshmen will he better adjusted
to their studies and more able to
handle the loss of time during
rushing.
2. There would be less pledge
breaking.
3. Fraternity costs in general
would be less. The cost of vacation
rushing would be much less in the
spring than at Christmas.
4. A more effective pledge pe
riod is possible. Proponents of
spring rushing say one quarter of
concentrated rushing would be
much better than spreading it out
over two quarters.
5. The weather is better spring
quarter. Hence, the booklet points
out, one can go to more places,
which provides for a greater variety
of parties.
6. Winter initiation is possible.
This would give pledges time to
know the house better before being
initiated. Also, there is much more
time in winter quarter with no foot
ball games.
The IFC bulletin also points out
several possible disadvantages of
spring rushing:
1. There would be a possibility of
illegal rushing. Those in favor of
the new rushing program say this
can be eliminated by strict and well
defined rules, and by freshman ori
entation and penalties on freshmen
as well as on the houses for partici
pating in illegal rushing.
2. There would be a possibility of
too much "package'' pledging (i.e.,
several students wanting to pledge
the same house together). The IFC
bulletin points out, however, that
spring quarter rushing would give
the freshmen a Ltter chance to
know who their real friends are.
3. There are more campus ac
tivities spring quarter. In order
to offset this, proponents of spring
rushing state that big functions
such as all-campus dances can be
changed to winter quarter.
4. There would be less time for
picking up pledges after formal
rushing ends. According to the IFC
bulletin, the number of pledges ta
ken into a house after rushing is
quite small and can be carried into
fall quarter if desired. The bulletin
also points out that by spring more
of the frosh will know definitely
what they want to do and hence
there should be less indecision.
5. Pledges have less time to get
to know the house. Spring rushing
proponents answer this by saying
that one quarter of concentrated
pledge training will be as effective
if not more effective than two quar
trs of vague association between the
pledges and the house.
Regarding the rushing schedule,
(he IFC has suggested a new one
which would consist of open
houses from Wednesday night
through Sunday afternoon, and
formal rushing from Sunday
night to II a.m. Saturday, at
which time pledge signing will
take place.
The reasoning behind these pro
posed changes is:
"The lengthening of open houses
will give each freshman a chance to
see every house without hurrying.
During the extensive freshman ori
entation it will be stressed that the
rushees take advantage of the ex
tended open house period to see
every house. In effect, since the
number of open houses is doubled
and the w r hole Row is rushing at the
same time, there will be a much
smaller number of rushees in the
house at any given time."

sion on the matter will be reached
by the IFC Wednesday night.
This decision will not be binding
on the eating clubs, which are ex
pected to consider the proposal fur
ther.
The revision involves three
changes:
1. Postponement of rushing ac
tivities to spring quarter.
2. Elimination of vacation rush
ing.
3. Revision of the actual rush
ing schedule.
A bulletin circulated by the IFC
Saturday to all fraternities and eat
ing clubs brings out many pros and
cons of the proposal. According to
this bulletin the advantages of put
ting off rushing until spring quarter
are:
1. The freshmen would benefit.
Proponents of the new policy point
out that freshmen would be more
settled in school and that they
would know more of what they
want.
As for studying, the bulletin
continues, grades will he more
defined by spring quarter, and
freshmen will he better adjusted
to their studies and more able to
handle the loss of time during
rushing.
2. There would be less pledge
breaking.
3. Fraternity costs in general
would be less. The cost of vacation
rushing would be much less in the
spring than at Christmas.
4. A more effective pledge pe
riod is possible. Proponents of
spring rushing say one quarter of
concentrated rushing would be
much better than spreading it out
over two quarters.
5. The weather is better spring
quarter. Hence, the booklet points
out, one can go to more places,
which provides for a greater variety
of parties.
6. Winter initiation is possible.
This would give pledges time to
know the house better before being
initiated. Also, there is much more
time in winter quarter with no foot
ball games.
The IFC bulletin also points out
several possible disadvantages of
spring rushing:
1. There would be a possibility of
illegal rushing. Those in favor of
the new rushing program say this
can be eliminated by strict and well
defined rules, and by freshman ori
entation and penalties on freshmen
as well as on the houses for partici
pating in illegal rushing.
2. There would be a possibility of
too much "package'' pledging (i.e.,
several students wanting to pledge
the same house together). The IFC
bulletin points out, however, that
spring quarter rushing would give
the freshmen a Ltter chance to
know who their real friends are.
3. There are more campus ac
tivities spring quarter. In order
to offset this, proponents of spring
rushing state that big functions
such as all-campus dances can be
changed to winter quarter.
4. There would be less time for
picking up pledges after formal
rushing ends. According to the IFC
bulletin, the number of pledges ta
ken into a house after rushing is
quite small and can be carried into
fall quarter if desired. The bulletin
also points out that by spring more
of the frosh will know definitely
what they want to do and hence
there should be less indecision.
5. Pledges have less time to get
to know the house. Spring rushing
proponents answer this by saying
that one quarter of concentrated
pledge training will be as effective
if not more effective than two quar
trs of vague association between the
pledges and the house.
Regarding the rushing schedule,
(he IFC has suggested a new one
which would consist of open
houses from Wednesday night
through Sunday afternoon, and
formal rushing from Sunday
night to II a.m. Saturday, at
which time pledge signing will
take place.
The reasoning behind these pro
posed changes is:
"The lengthening of open houses
will give each freshman a chance to
see every house without hurrying.
During the extensive freshman ori
entation it will be stressed that the
rushees take advantage of the ex
tended open house period to see
every house. In effect, since the
number of open houses is doubled
and the w r hole Row is rushing at the
same time, there will be a much
smaller number of rushees in the
house at any given time."
The proposed revision of
rushing policy, of which the
most important point is the post
ponement of all rushing to
spring quarter, will be discussed
tonight in fraternity house meet
ings and by the Interclub Coun
cil.
Proposed last Wednesday night
by the Interfratcrnity Council, a
body consisting of all the frater

ing clubs brings out many pros and
cons of the proposal. According to
this bulletin the advantages of put
ting off rushing until spring quarter
are:
1. The freshmen would benefit.
Proponents of the new policy point
out that freshmen would be more
settled in school and that they
would know more of what they
want.
As for studying, the bulletin
continues, grades will he more
defined by spring quarter, and
freshmen will he better adjusted
to their studies and more able to
handle the loss of time during
rushing.
2. There would be less pledge
breaking.
3. Fraternity costs in general
would be less. The cost of vacation
rushing would be much less in the
spring than at Christmas.
4. A more effective pledge pe
riod is possible. Proponents of
spring rushing say one quarter of
concentrated rushing would be
much better than spreading it out
over two quarters.
5. The weather is better spring
quarter. Hence, the booklet points
out, one can go to more places,
which provides for a greater variety
of parties.
6. Winter initiation is possible.
This would give pledges time to
know the house better before being
initiated. Also, there is much more
time in winter quarter with no foot
ball games.
The IFC bulletin also points out
several possible disadvantages of
spring rushing:
1. There would be a possibility of
illegal rushing. Those in favor of
the new rushing program say this
can be eliminated by strict and well
defined rules, and by freshman ori
entation and penalties on freshmen
as well as on the houses for partici
pating in illegal rushing.
2. There would be a possibility of
too much "package'' pledging (i.e.,
several students wanting to pledge
the same house together). The IFC
The proposed revision of
rushing policy, of which the
most important point is the post
ponement of all rushing to
spring quarter, will be discussed
tonight in fraternity house meet
ings and by the Interclub Coun
cil.
Proposed last Wednesday night
by the Interfratcrnity Council, a
body consisting of all the frater
nity presidents, this rushing revi
sion has been referred to the indi
vidual houses and to the eating
clubs for discussion. A final deci
sion on the matter will be reached
by the IFC Wednesday night.
This decision will not be binding
on the eating clubs, which are ex
pected to consider the proposal fur
ther.
The revision involves three
changes:
1. Postponement of rushing ac
tivities to spring quarter.
2. Elimination of vacation rush
ing.
3. Revision of the actual rush
ing schedule.

2. There would be a possibility of
too much "package'' pledging (i.e.,
several students wanting to pledge
the same house together). The IFC
bulletin points out, however, that
spring quarter rushing would give
the freshmen a Ltter chance to
know who their real friends are.
3. There are more campus ac
tivities spring quarter. In order
to offset this, proponents of spring
rushing state that big functions
such as all-campus dances can be
changed to winter quarter.
4. There would be less time for
picking up pledges after formal
rushing ends. According to the IFC
bulletin, the number of pledges ta
ken into a house after rushing is
quite small and can be carried into
fall quarter if desired. The bulletin
also points out that by spring more
of the frosh will know definitely
what they want to do and hence
there should be less indecision.
5. Pledges have less time to get
to know the house. Spring rushing
proponents answer this by saying
that one quarter of concentrated
pledge training will be as effective
if not more effective than two quar
trs of vague association between the
pledges and the house.
Regarding the rushing schedule,
(he IFC has suggested a new one
which would consist of open
houses from Wednesday night
through Sunday afternoon, and
formal rushing from Sunday
night to II a.m. Saturday, at
which time pledge signing will
take place.
The reasoning behind these pro
posed changes is:
"The lengthening of open houses
will give each freshman a chance to
see every house without hurrying.
During the extensive freshman ori
entation it will be stressed that the
rushees take advantage of the ex
tended open house period to see
every house. In effect, since the
number of open houses is doubled
and the w r hole Row is rushing at the
same time, there will be a much
smaller number of rushees in the
house at any given time."
