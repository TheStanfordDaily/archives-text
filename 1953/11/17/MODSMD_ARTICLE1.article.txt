# Jet Crashes Near Rudy's; Second Plane Is Missing
## 
### IRWIN JOHNSON 
One of two Navy Banshee jet fighters on a routine flight crashed
and blew apart on a hillside off Alpine Road, 500 yards from
Rudy's Alpine Inn, yesterday at about 2:10 p.m. An intense search
is being launched for the second plane which is reported missing.
The theory has been advanced that the two planes might have

collided in mid-air. "j
The pilot of the jet that disinte- I
grated on the hillside near Rudy's
managed to parachute to saftey. He
has been identified a.s Lieutenant
Commander C. J. Lee.
As yet, no sign of the second craft
or its pilot has been found.
The jet was reported missing by
authorities at iYloffctt Field Naval
Air Station, home base of the two
planes, after its wing-mate was
found wrecked. Officials at the sta
tion last night told The Daily that
search for the missing craft would
be touched oil at an intense pace
beginning al dawn today. Search
proved impossible last night be
cause of darkness.
The two planes look off from Mof
fett Field at 2:03 p.m. on a flight to
Fallon, Nevada.
The plane that smacked into the
hillside with splintering impact was
first spotted by eye-witnesses when
it dove through the heavy clouds
over the Page Mill Quarry, where
the pilot bailed out.
After Lee jumped, the plane pro
ceeded toward Felt, Lake, zoomed
abruptly into the dark cloud bank,
then whistled into a near vertical
dive and then plunged into the hill
side.
Persons watching the plane before
it crashed said apparently it was
intact and that there were no signs
of trouble. Few persons saw the
pilot parachute from the jet.
Authorities at. the crash site con
ceded the possibility that the two
jets might have collided. Low cloud
formations, however, prevented any
sight of a mid-air crash.
The Daily secured the following
eye-witness accounts of the explo
sive crash:
l)on Faciola, of 9 Arastradcro
Road, said he was working outside
bis house when lie heard the plane.
"I turned around and it was coming
right toward me. It pulled up when
it was about 100 feet from me, rose
for a while, and then dived right
into the bill across the valley. It
came so close that the whole house
rattled."
Fireman Lew Stacy, on duty at
Woodside Fire Station Number Two
on Portola Road about a half mile
from the crash, gave this account:
"I saw one crash. It was a straight
dive. The plane never explocied be
fore it hit the ground. When it did
hit there was a big cloud of fire and
smoke. When I first saw the plane
it was already in the dive. Before
that I heard this funny sound and

ran outside and saw it crash."
Immediately following the crash
the area around Rudy's Alpine Inn
became a scene of confusion as of
ficials of the Navy, San Mateo Coun
ty sheriff's deputies, and Woodside
firemen converged on the scene.
After a preliminary inspection of
the scattered wreckage, authorities
were unable to determine what
caused the crash.
Not for an hour after the crash was
Lee able to make his way across to
a farmhouse from which he tel
ephoned Moffett Field. He was taken
by ambulance to the base hospital,
reportedly suffering from a slight
back injury, possibly a sprain.
Late last night he was said to be
resting quietly at the hospital.
No statement was available from
him regarding the reason for the
crash.
Wreckage of the plane which
crashed near Alpine Road, about five
miles from campus, was scattered
over a half-mile area. The main por
tion of the body of the plane was
buried in the side of the hill by the
force of the impact.
Small fires were burning in the
brush up to 100 feet from the spot
of the crash, and the early arrivals
to the scene were forced from the
crash scene by the explosions of
50-calibcr machine gun bullets. The
fires were quickly extinguished by
Woodside firemen.


CRASH REMAINS—A wheel and a wing section are isolated remains of a sleek Navy Banshee
jet fighter that crashed into a hillside behind campus yesterday. Another plane, which took off
with the wrecked aircraft at 2:03 p.m. from Moffett Field Naval Air Station on a training flight to
Fallon, Nevada, is reported missing. The pilot of the plane which crashed near Alpine Road para
chuted to safety three miles south of the crash scene.
