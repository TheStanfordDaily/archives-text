# Cal Says Axe May Appear At One of Big Game Rallies
## 
### BOB REZAK 
Student officials at University of California yesterday reported
they "strongly suspect" that the missing Stanford Axe will show
up in time for either Thursday night's Stanford bonfire rally or
UC's Big Game rally Friday night in Berkeley.
John Kirbey-Miller. senior, and head of the special UC Axe-

finding committee which has been
searching for the blade since it was
stolen last June, said he believed
that whoever took the Axe would
be a "good sport" and return it for
cither university's rally.
He said, however, that he had no .

official information that this would
definitely be the case.
Miller said he thinks it was UC
students who took the Axe, al
though he did not discount the
possibility that it may be at Stan
ford.
Miller indicated that the spirit at
UC was at a low ebb last spring,
prior to the disappearance of the
trophy, and that several students
were heard talking about a publicity
stunt involving the theft of the Axe.
He said that several groups, includ
ing members of the senior class,
had talked over the idea at that
time.
Ralph Vcttcrlein, president, of the
Associated Students of UC, an
nounced that if the Axe fails to
show up by Saturday in time for the
Big Game, the plaque on which the
Axe was mounted would have to
be presented to Stanford should the
Cardinals win the traditional clas
sic. •
Meanwhile, the Oakland Trib
une reported that if the Axe is
not found by this weekend several
persons may be charged with the
theft. The paper did not explain
who the persons arc or who might
file the charges.
UC authorities said they were not
planning to file charges because they
had no suspects whom they could
charge with the theft.
The Tribune published reports re
cently that it. learned that a group
of UC students was planning to make
a "bogus" copy of the Axe for pre
sentation at Saturday's game if the
original one does not turn up.
The newspaper at. the same time
said it had information that what has
been purported to be the "original"
Axe is not the original, but also a
phony or "bogus" copy of the blade.
The paper said it had informa
tion that indieatcd the original
Axe, forged in March 1899, was
"lost forever" in 1927, and that an
imitation Axe has been used as a
Big (iame trophy ever since.
The newspaper said it learned a
group of UC students had been in
contact with an Oakland manufac
turer of axes, and thai students had
been seen in the Stephens Union
comparing the plaque, from which
the Axe had been unscrewed, with
a catalog that apparently contained
models of axes.
IJC student spokesmen labeled
these reports as "preposterous."
Miller said that, if any students
were planning such a maneuver his
Axe-finding committee would have
heard about it.
Vcttcrlein said that a bogus Axe
would be a poor substitute for the
real thing. "Besides," he said, "du
plicating the Axe would cost sev
eral hundred dollars and we don't
have that kind of money to pay for
it."
Stanford last won the Axe trophy,
traditional symbol of rivalry be
tween Stanford and UC, in 1946.
Stanford has won six Big Games
and the University of California
nine since the Axe has been used
as a trophy.

une reported that if the Axe is
not found by this weekend several
persons may be charged with the
theft. The paper did not explain
who the persons arc or who might
file the charges.
UC authorities said they were not
planning to file charges because they
had no suspects whom they could
charge with the theft.
The Tribune published reports re
cently that it. learned that a group
of UC students was planning to make
a "bogus" copy of the Axe for pre
sentation at Saturday's game if the
original one does not turn up.
The newspaper at. the same time
said it had information that what has
been purported to be the "original"
Axe is not the original, but also a
phony or "bogus" copy of the blade.
The paper said it had informa
tion that indieatcd the original
Axe, forged in March 1899, was
"lost forever" in 1927, and that an
imitation Axe has been used as a
Big (iame trophy ever since.
The newspaper said it learned a
group of UC students had been in
contact with an Oakland manufac
turer of axes, and thai students had
been seen in the Stephens Union
comparing the plaque, from which
the Axe had been unscrewed, with
a catalog that apparently contained
models of axes.
IJC student spokesmen labeled
these reports as "preposterous."
Miller said that, if any students
were planning such a maneuver his
Axe-finding committee would have
heard about it.
Vcttcrlein said that a bogus Axe
would be a poor substitute for the
real thing. "Besides," he said, "du
plicating the Axe would cost sev
eral hundred dollars and we don't
have that kind of money to pay for
it."
Stanford last won the Axe trophy,
traditional symbol of rivalry be
tween Stanford and UC, in 1946.
Stanford has won six Big Games
and the University of California
nine since the Axe has been used
as a trophy.
Student officials at University of California yesterday reported
they "strongly suspect" that the missing Stanford Axe will show
up in time for either Thursday night's Stanford bonfire rally or
UC's Big Game rally Friday night in Berkeley.
John Kirbey-Miller. senior, and head of the special UC Axe-

finding committee which has been
searching for the blade since it was
stolen last June, said he believed
that whoever took the Axe would
be a "good sport" and return it for
cither university's rally.
He said, however, that he had no .

official information that this would
definitely be the case.
Miller said he thinks it was UC
students who took the Axe, al
though he did not discount the
possibility that it may be at Stan
ford.
Miller indicated that the spirit at
UC was at a low ebb last spring,
prior to the disappearance of the
trophy, and that several students
were heard talking about a publicity
stunt involving the theft of the Axe.
He said that several groups, includ
ing members of the senior class,
had talked over the idea at that
time.
Ralph Vcttcrlein, president, of the
Associated Students of UC, an
nounced that if the Axe fails to
show up by Saturday in time for the
Big Game, the plaque on which the
Axe was mounted would have to
be presented to Stanford should the
Cardinals win the traditional clas
sic. •
