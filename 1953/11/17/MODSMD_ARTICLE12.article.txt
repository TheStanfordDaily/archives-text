# THE
						BIG GAME DRAWS NEAR
## Cards Are Healthy, Says Jarvis As Coaches Stress Defensive Drill 
### PETE GROTHE 
Trainer Connie Jarvis last night
proclaimed that the Indian gridders
will go into this year's Bit* Game in
better physical shape than in any
Uig Game sincc the war.
Jarvis, the man with the bow tic,
said that in previous Cal tussles the
Cards have always had a number of
key men with stiff joints and bat
tered muscles. This year, every man
on the first, three strings will be
ready<
The only injury of any conse
quence is fo tackle Matt Armitagc,
who has a charley horse over his
knee. However, his knee lias im
measurably improved since Satur
day and he is a sure participant in
the Game that is the true meaning
of that, overworked word, "big."
Chuck Taylor said, "I think that
we have our best chancc of heat
ing Cal sincc 1 have' been coach
ing here. In 1951, we had a ftood
i chance, hut several of our boys,
including IMathias, were hurt and
the kids didn't have the incentive
that we do now. Then, we had
already cinched the Rose Bowl.
Now, we must win this game to
gel there.''
Defense and more defense was
the key last night. The coaching
staff risked the chance of injuries
last night by running the squad

through a defensive scrimmage
against Cal plays. The theory of
the scrimmage is that if Stanford
can stop Cal, it can win.
The Indians have never had any
trouble scoring. They rackcd up

three tallies against USC and UC
LA. But they have had trouble
holding teams. Thus, the stress on
defetisc this week.
The spirit was high last night.
There arc a lot of seniors on the
team who don't care to "wait till
next year."
