# Urge Support for Rushing Plan
## 
### 
The plan to postpone fraternity rushing ac
tivities from winter to spring quarter, as pro
posed by several memoers of the Interfrater
iity Council, including President Gene Dils, is,
w< think, a constructive suggestion that, if
adopted, could help alleviate some of the tra
ditional troubles attached to rushing.
I'or one thing and ! in our mind is the
most important single consideration- a post
ponement would allow freshman men more of
i opportunity to adjust their siudy and social
1; :)its to the heavy demands of University life.
The first quarter in University, as is gener
-11 y realized, is an exploratory period during
which a student Dies to test and determine his
abilities and aptitudes.
Therefore, it would seem, the second quar-
Ii ideally should be a settling down period,
during which a student . liould try to analyze
nr.'i implement the lessons learned during W.at
.-.ometimes bewildering first three months at
Stanford.
This, however, has usually been impossible
for freshman men who, for the most part, have
f.-'.'/n caught up in the rushing r.ujo as soon as
fall quarter ends and the Christmas vacation
period takes up.
And they remain caught up through most of
winter and spring quarters, and as a conse
quence resolutions that might have been drawn
from the experiences of the first quatter are

propped by the wayside, ignored.
The plan put forward by Dils and his asso
ciates, as we see it, would give the frosh the
time needed to adjust to the study require
ments imposed by a college curriculum and,
perhaps even more significantly, the time
needed to become more thoroughly integrated
with their class < nd the whole web of Univer
sity life.
We feel that fraternities tend too much to
set themselves apart 'I to hold their members
to the essentially limited range of "house ac
tivities" a situation that we believe has a
weakening effect on the University as a whole.
The plan to postpone rushing for a quarter,
we feel, would provid" the best and most rea
sonable way io counter,:'l that fraternity pa
rochialism.
Another advantage wo s< e in such a post
ponemeri is tln.t it would eliminate the need
for Christmas rushing, usually a lengthy, tir
ing, and expensive process.
Further, it would, we feel, provide the fresh
men with a chance to b come better acquaint
< ' Wi h ! h•< xl1■ ; ii f ..?: ; :..rir; of the various
houses.
Other advantages substantial ones at that,

advantages of the pjpn was submitted to the

The plan to postpone fraternity rushing ac
tivities from winter to spring quarter, as pro
posed by several memoers of the Interfrater
iity Council, including President Gene Dils, is,
w< think, a constructive suggestion that, if
adopted, could help alleviate some of the tra
ditional troubles attached to rushing.
I'or one thing and ! in our mind is the
most important single consideration- a post
ponement would allow freshman men more of
i opportunity to adjust their siudy and social
1; :)its to the heavy demands of University life.
The first quarter in University, as is gener
-11 y realized, is an exploratory period during
which a student Dies to test and determine his
abilities and aptitudes.
Therefore, it would seem, the second quar-
Ii ideally should be a settling down period,
during which a student . liould try to analyze
nr.'i implement the lessons learned during W.at
.-.ometimes bewildering first three months at
Stanford.
This, however, has usually been impossible
for freshman men who, for the most part, have
f.-'.'/n caught up in the rushing r.ujo as soon as
fall quarter ends and the Christmas vacation
period takes up.
And they remain caught up through most of
winter and spring quarters, and as a conse
quence resolutions that might have been drawn
from the experiences of the first quatter are

propped by the wayside, ignored.
The plan put forward by Dils and his asso
ciates, as we see it, would give the frosh the
time needed to adjust to the study require
ments imposed by a college curriculum and,
perhaps even more significantly, the time
needed to become more thoroughly integrated
with their class < nd the whole web of Univer
sity life.
We feel that fraternities tend too much to
set themselves apart 'I to hold their members
to the essentially limited range of "house ac
tivities" a situation that we believe has a
weakening effect on the University as a whole.
