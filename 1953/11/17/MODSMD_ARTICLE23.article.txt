Enlarging on this theme, which
was prominent in his question-and
answer session, the renowned i-vm
phony conductor said that th re is
too much standardization of person
ality today.
"The men and women who have
contributed to progress in the his

tory of civilization have al\\a\ i
been members of a minority," he
stated.
Holding out hope for the younger
generation, he expressed the opinion
that the young people of today s em
to rebel against standardiz; tion in
any form. This rebellion ;.u!',ur
great tilings for the future oi mu ie.
"The future of music is in the
hands of the younger generation and
we can put it into those hands with
I confidence—it will be great."'
