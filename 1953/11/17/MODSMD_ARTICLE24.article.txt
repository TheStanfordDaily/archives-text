### 
The NCAA television committee and General Motors have

Yesterday morning Harvey Cas
i l athletic director at the Uni
i-i.sily of Washington and the West
Coast representative on the televi
ion committee, notified Stanford
Athletic Director A 1 Master.- that
tin committee will allow the tele
casting. Several other games in the
nation this season also have been
■ iven such permission.
That left the following options up
to General Motors: (1) presenting
the game unJer their spon er.ship
ii te id of the USC-UCLA game on
KKON-TV; (2) not allowing the
me to be telecast at all; (3) spon
• f;r!.'i'j the game on another station
and thereby competing with their
'(the]- sponsored contest; (1) giving
Stanford the right to negotiate with
oilier sponsors fpr the rights.
General Motors chose the last of
lli'e options, which is definitely
beneficial financially to Stanford.
I lad GM chosen to be the spoil or.
Ntaiiford would have received only
$7,500 for TV rights. Being able to
ne; otiate privately, the price should
I if considerably higher than that.
A sponsor has already contacted

Masters and indicated interest in
• ponsoring the game. As yet, how
ever, the prospective sponsor has
not been officially announced.
General Motors announcement
came as relief to Stanford officials.
Last year when the same applica
tion was made GM decided to spon
sor the game themselves instead of
the Southland tjit. This year the
Indian representatives specifically
j asked that their game not be alter
native hut supplementary. Last
season they were under consider
able attack from fans who would
! have preferred the USC - UCLA
contest. They were afraid the same
j would hold true this year, with the
I Los Angeles game being as impor
tant as it is.
Negotiations with the prospective
sponsors will be concluded this
j morning.
