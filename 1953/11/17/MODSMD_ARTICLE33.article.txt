# BIG GAME PREVIEW
## Taylor: Cards Will Score at Least 3 TD's; Waldorf Wonders How to Stop Garrett 
### DON WEBSTER 
"Stanford should score three times against Cal. The only problem is how many times the Bears
will score."
So spoke Card Coach Chuck Taylor yesterday at the Northern California Football Writers meet
ing. The luncheon was held at Rickey's in Palo Alto in honor of the Big Game Saturday. Stanford
was the host for the group. 1
The Athletic Dapartment pulled out all the stops in giving the banguet. The luxurious feast, ap-

propriately enough, was held m the*
Rose Room.
The Indian coach was respectful I
of the Berkeley eleven in his talk.
"Paul Larson offers a real threat j
with his optional pass-run play. He
puts real pressure on the ends and '
halfbacks. II they stay back, he
runs. If they rush, he passes over
their heads."
When asked to compare Larson
and Paul Cameron of UCLA, Tay
lor picked the Cal hack.
"He is a great runner; he does
n't run quite as hard, hut is more
tricky. On top of that he is a
much better passer."
Pappy Waldorf, in addressing the
group, said he didn't know how he !
was going to stop the Card passing
attack. He said that the previous
night his coaching staff had stayed
uj> until ahnosi 1 a.m. in trying to
figure out a defense again t Boh
Garrett.
"Even then," Waldorf declared, I
"we had to table it its unfinished
business."
Neither coach has had an oppor
tunity to see the other team in ac
tion this season, but several assist
ant coaches have. Joe Ruetz has
scouted the Bears for Stanford,
while Zeb Chancy has seen the
Cards for Cal.
Both a >istant coaches were
highly respectful of the opposi
, tion. Iluetz was full of praise for ;
a number of Bears.
"Talley and Marks both represent
backs who e.m go all the way at any i
lime," he said. "Hazeltine is the :
best linebacker on the coast. Dut
' ton is an outstanding guard."
Though Ruetz had seen Cal many
times in the past, he had never be
fore seen them presenting such a
twin - pronged attack. He called
I arson's combined air and running
game a real threat.
Chaney jokingly said that he is
so pessimistic these days about Cal's
chances that he is beginning to be
called "Eggs," u reference to Eggs
i Manske, a former Bear assistant
coach well known for his pessimism.
Chaney praised the Card line.
'Besides the fine ends and quar
terback they have, the line is out
standing. That iron ring they
form around Garrett when he
passes has yet to he penetrated
this year, even T>y USC."
Also present at the luncheon was
Bob Bronzan, coach of San Jose
State. "We played a terrible game
against Stanford," he said, "but
even if we had been at our best we
j would have lost. We have run out
i of excuses for losing to Stanford.

When we played them at the begin
ning of the season we said, 'If we'd
only played them later!' When we
faced them in the middle of the sea
son, we called it our midseason
slump. Now that we've played them
at the end, we have no more alibis.
Honored guest at the luncheon
was Glenn S. "Pop" Warner, for
mer Stanford coaching great.
Warner, now X.'{ and bothered by
arthritis, is stili keen of mind. He

1 said that In* favors the present
substitution rule, and could nut
-re why anyone should want to
: change.
When asked for a prediction of
the Bit; Game, he at first reneged,
; and then cho e the Indians. His
view.-, seemed to coincide with
Taylor's remark that "Stanford, on
any given Saturday, can beat any
. given team in the natior\."
"This might be the Saturday."
