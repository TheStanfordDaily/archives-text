# Scientist Finds Cancer Causes
## 
### 
Professor Ha I ley Kirkman of the
Stanford Anatomy Department has
found that sex hormones can cause
at least two kinds of cancer in ham
sters.
One kind is similar to the dread
ed melanoma, or "black cancer," in
man. The other is a kidney cancer
which in some respects resembles a
type that commonly afflicts chil
dren.
This information was presented
by the scientist to the Seventh An
nual Urologic Research Convention
yesterday in Los Angeles. His re
search into hcrmonally induced tu
mors has been under way for sev
eral years, and is continuing under
grants from the National Cancer
Institute and the American Cancer
Society.
Dr. Kirkman has been using a
Syrian strain of hamsters in recent
experiments. Each animal has a
pair of pigmented spots which are
characteristic markings of the
breed.
When he injected them simulta
neously with the female hormone,
estrogen, and a male hormone, an
drogen, they developed melanoma
like tumors under the pigmented
spots.
The tumors did not disappear
when treatment with the two hor
mones was halted. But they did fail
to develop when the pigmented
spots were removed in advance of
treatment.
When transplanted to a healthy
hamster, the tumors became malig
nant and spread to the lungs.
