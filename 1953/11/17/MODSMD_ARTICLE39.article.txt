# Frosh Will Start Bonfire Big Push Tomorrow Noon
## 
### 
Tomorrow is Big Push Day for
the Class of 1957, as the fresh
men hustle preparations for the
Big Game Bonfire Thursday
night.
The bonfire has been under con- )
struction in the dry bed of Lake
Lagunita since last week, and will
be filled in with brush and scrap
wood between tomorrow noon and
the Big Game rally at Lake Lag
Thursday night.
Freshman spirit is high for the
drive, spokesmen of Encina and
Village frosh said. The bonfire com
mittee has stated that there will be
a great need for frosh from 7 a.m.
tomorrow right through to the
burning of the fire, although the
Big Push does not start until noon. !
An indication of the spirit
which the freshmen have built up
came Sunday evening when close
to 100 men rushed to the bonfire
site in response to what proved
to be a false lire alarm.
Committee members made re
newed calls for all frosh lo turn out
for the Big Push. "We'll have the
facilities to put every man who
turns out to work," construction
boss Paul Bissinger said. "The big
ger the turnout, the bigger the fire."
Bonfire committee men outlined
final plans for the Big Push with
sponsors and wing presidents at En
cina last night. Village men were
also briefed through head Village
sponsor Bob Rodolf.
Encina head sponsor Tom
Blount pointed out that the fall
quarter draft test has been sched
uled for Thursday, the morning
after the Big Push. He urged that
men taking the draft test work in
the afternoon Wednesday and
Thursday, and he in bed by !) p.m.
Wednesday.
"This is definitely not a matter of
the men involved welshing," Blount
said. "It's essential that they be
ready for that test. But they should
get out there and work in the af
ternoons, and everyone who isn't
taking the test should be out there
for at least a good part of the night,
too."
The pyre will be topped ofT with
a colorful dccoration which has
been kept a sccrct so far by dcco
ration chairman Louis Dclcamo.
It will be installed on Thursday
afternoon, when actual construc
tion on the fire has been complet
ed.
Then oil trucks will pump ap
proximately 750 gallons of diesfel oil
onto the bonfire, and, according to
Bissinger, "Rain or shine, we'll have
a torch that will singe Oskic's beard
clear over in Berkeley!"

Thursday night.
Freshman spirit is high for the
drive, spokesmen of Encina and
Village frosh said. The bonfire com
mittee has stated that there will be
a great need for frosh from 7 a.m.
tomorrow right through to the
burning of the fire, although the
Big Push does not start until noon. !
An indication of the spirit
which the freshmen have built up
came Sunday evening when close
to 100 men rushed to the bonfire
site in response to what proved
to be a false lire alarm.
Committee members made re
newed calls for all frosh lo turn out
for the Big Push. "We'll have the
facilities to put every man who
turns out to work," construction
boss Paul Bissinger said. "The big
ger the turnout, the bigger the fire."
Bonfire committee men outlined
final plans for the Big Push with
sponsors and wing presidents at En
cina last night. Village men were
also briefed through head Village
sponsor Bob Rodolf.
Encina head sponsor Tom
Blount pointed out that the fall
quarter draft test has been sched
uled for Thursday, the morning
after the Big Push. He urged that
men taking the draft test work in
the afternoon Wednesday and
Thursday, and he in bed by !) p.m.
Wednesday.
"This is definitely not a matter of
the men involved welshing," Blount
said. "It's essential that they be
ready for that test. But they should
get out there and work in the af
ternoons, and everyone who isn't
taking the test should be out there
for at least a good part of the night,
too."
The pyre will be topped ofT with
a colorful dccoration which has
been kept a sccrct so far by dcco
ration chairman Louis Dclcamo.
It will be installed on Thursday
afternoon, when actual construc
tion on the fire has been complet
ed.
Then oil trucks will pump ap
proximately 750 gallons of diesfel oil
onto the bonfire, and, according to
Bissinger, "Rain or shine, we'll have
a torch that will singe Oskic's beard
clear over in Berkeley!"
