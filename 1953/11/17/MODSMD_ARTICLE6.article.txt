### 
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 16
(UP)â€”Former President Truman
said tonight the late Harry Dex
ter White was kept in the gov
ernment to protect investigation
of espionage by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.
He told a nationwide television
and radio audience that Attorney
General Herbert Brownell's charges
that he, in effect, "knowingly be
trayed" the security of the United
States was degrading to the admin
istration of justice by making of it
"cheap political trickery."
Truman branded as a "falsehood"
Brownell's charge that he as Presi
dent had promoted White from As
sistant Secretary of the Treasury to
U.S. executive director of the In
ternational Monetary Fund, despite
FBI reports that White was a Rus
sian spy.
He said White was retained in
the Monetary Fund for the protec
tion of the public interest and se
curity.
Truman said tbc public was en
titled to (lie facts, "not just the
misleading statements that this
present administration finds it po
litically expedient to make."
"On November 6 the new admin
istration, through Herbert Brown
ell, Jr., a former chairman of the
Republican National Committee
now serving as Attorney General,
made a personal attack on me,"
Truman said.
"Brownell made this attack in the
course of a political speech before
a luncheon club in Chicago. This
attack is without parallel, I believe,
in the history of our country."
Truman stated, "I have been
accused in cfTect of knowingly be
traying tbc security of the United
States. "This charge is, of course,
a falsehood, and the man who
made it had every reason to know
it is a falsehood."
The former chief executive said
White's retention in the Monetary
Fund was for the protection of the
public interest and security.
"In backing away from this
charge with the mealy - mouthed
statement that he had no intention
of impugning the loyalty of any
high official of the prior adminis
tration, he lied to the American
people again."
Truman <said that Brownell, iden
tified as "the highest legal officer
in our government," degraded the
highest function of government,
the administration of justice, into
"cheap political trickery."
"And in saying, 'Harry Dexter
White was known to be a Commu
nist spy by the very people who ap
pointed him,' he lied to the Ameri
can people," he said.
In Washington, Republicans and
Democrats split violently tonight
over former President Truman's ac
count of his handling of the Harry
Dexter White "spy" case.
There was no comment from
President Eisenhower, Attorney
General Herbert Brownell, Jr., FBI
Director J. Edgar Hoover, or Su
preme Court Justice Tom C. Clark.
But Congressional Republicans
charged that Truman's radio
television report to the nation
was incomplete and contradictory.
Democrats called it a "clcar" and
"concise" statement of "fact."
