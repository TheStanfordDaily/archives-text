# THREE DAYS TO GO
## Head Injury Will Probably Keep Smith Out of Game 
### PETE GROTHE Sports Editor, The Daily 
It was too good to last.
Ihe injury situation, which at the beginning of the week had
been so bright, was clouded at 5:36 last night when first string
tackle Barry Smith received a knee in the head and was knocked
groggy.
Smith, a six-four senior from Inglewood, has had trouble with

a head injury for two years, and he
is almost definitely out of the Big
Game. He was sent to the Palo Alto
hospital for observation last night,
and team physician Fritz Roth will
make the final decision today.
It means the end of the football
career for the likeable Smith who
has always been a tough luck foot
ball player.
That means that two proven
journeymen, Win Wedge and Matt
Armitage, will start at tackles.
Armitage is recovering from a
charley horse, and was running
much better last night.
Practice last night consisted of a
defensive scrimmage, passing prac
tice, polishing plays, and 10 consecu
tive 50 yard wind sprints.
The first official odds rated Stan
ford a seven point favorite, a position
the coaches have been fighting to
avoid.
But if the league statistics mean
anything, the game will be closer
than your next breath.
Stanford is first in the PCC and
tenth in liic nation in total offense
with 3!»0.2 yards per game. Cal
is second in the PCC and eleventh
in the country with 347.fi yards an
outing.
Defensively, the Cards are fourth
in the conference, having allowed
opponents 273.'2 yards a game. Cal,
again, is one notch behind the Indi
ans, having given up 275.3,
Bob Garrett retains his strangle
hold on nation and PCC passing
marks with 10'' completions in 178
attempts for .506 average and 1,50(5
yards. Sam Morlcy has cinched the
conference receiving title with 39
