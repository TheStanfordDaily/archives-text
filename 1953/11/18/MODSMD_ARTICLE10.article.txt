### DON WEBSTER 
The Stanford campus was
raided for the fourth time
within two weeks late Mon
day night when vandals, evi
dently from the University of
California, painted the side
walk in front of Hoover Tow
er and the two statues in front
on the Museum.
Though there were no indica
tions on campus as to who the
raiders were, the Daily Califor
nian, student newspaper at UC,
received an anonymous note
yesterday morning which
seemed to trace the vandalism to
Berkeley students.
Blue and gold paint was
smeared on the statues of Mel
nandro and Fede at the Museum.
A gold "C" was crudely painted
at Hoover Tower. According to
campus policc, who narrowly
missed catching the vandals, the
raid occurred about 11 p.m.
It seemed to Stanford officials
that the raiders were in a hurry.
Brushes were apparently not
used—at Hoover Tower the paint
had been simply poured on the
ground in the shape of a "C."
The vandals left four empty
paint containers behind. They
were quart cans of a high-grade
house paint. Police believe there
may be a possibility of tracing
the purchase of the cans.
The anonymous letter was
left on an editor's desk at the


SHAVE AND MANICURE, SIR?-M. A. Kelley and Manuel San
chez of the Corp Yard go to work removing the paint from the
statues in front of the Museum. Vandais painted them blue and
gold late Monday night. —Daily photo by lack Byrne
