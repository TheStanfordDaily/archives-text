# Paint Splashed on Statues, Sidewalk In Latest Raid by Vandals on Campus
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
The Stanford campus was
raided for the fourth time
within two weeks late Mon
day night when vandals, evi
dently from the University of
California, painted the side
walk in front of Hoover Tow
er and the two statues in front
on the Museum.
Though there were no indica
tions on campus as to who the
raiders were, the Daily Califor
nian, student newspaper at UC,
received an anonymous note
yesterday morning which
seemed to trace the vandalism to
Berkeley students.
Blue and gold paint was
smeared on the statues of Mel
nandro and Fede at the Museum.
A gold "C" was crudely painted
at Hoover Tower. According to
campus policc, who narrowly
missed catching the vandals, the
raid occurred about 11 p.m.
It seemed to Stanford officials
that the raiders were in a hurry.
Brushes were apparently not
used—at Hoover Tower the paint
had been simply poured on the
ground in the shape of a "C."
The vandals left four empty
paint containers behind. They
were quart cans of a high-grade
house paint. Police believe there
may be a possibility of tracing
the purchase of the cans.
The anonymous letter was
left on an editor's desk at the

Daily Cal. It was left shortly be
fore noon, before any newspapers
had printed news of the incident. ,
The letter read:
"To the Daily Cal staff: Gentle- I
men and Ladies,
"It is with much regret that I and j
my four associates report to you j
that there was a slight accident last i
evening at "The Farm" in Palo '
Alto. It seems that while we were j
down there sightseeing a couple of j
cans of blue and two more cans of
gold paint happened to fall on a
couple of statues respectively. We
are very sorry that the Egyptian
Museum (sic) now has one blue and
one gold statue.
"There is also one other slight
accident which you may be inter
ested in knowing. It also seems that
while we were down there one of
our members happened to spill
some paint on one of the slats to
ward the top of the stairs toward
Hoover Tower. It also seems that
this paint just happened to fall on
the ground in the outline of a "C."
We are indeed sorry about this
little accident, especially since this
is Big Game Week. Perhaps no one
will notice our little accident."
There was no signature on the
note.
The freshmen are not guarding
any parts of the campus this year
except the bonfire. Frosh guards
on duty Monday niftht reported a
group of about eight people who
were seen sneaking through the
lake bed about 11. They were
frightened away, and it is be
lieved they may have been upper
classmen trying to sabotage the
Lake Lagunita bonfire.
A patrolman on duty discovered
the Hoover Tower painting while
the paint was still wet a few mo
ments after 11. It is believed the
vandals were at the Museum at the
very moment he was reporting the
first case of vandalism.
Officials said that while the Hoo
ver Tower sidewalk paint can be
easily eradicated, the job of remov
ing the paint from the statues is a
difficult one. Authorities were un
able -to estimate what the probable
expense will be.
Dean of Students at Stanford H.
Donald Winbigler said he will report
the violation of the non-aggression
pact to California officials this
morning. He said he has been
proud of the conduct of Stanford

"To the best of my knowledge,
no Stanford students have at
tempted retaliation at Berkeley,"
he said. "Of course it only takes
j one or two students to make the
entire school look had. Hut I am
[ confident out school will keep the
pact."
According to Winbigler, Califor
nia will probably pay the damage
repair costs.

The Stanford campus was
raided for the fourth time
within two weeks late Mon
day night when vandals, evi
dently from the University of

walk in front of Hoover Tow

on the Museum.
Though there were no indica
tions on campus as to who the
raiders were, the Daily Califor

received an anonymous note
yesterday morning which
seemed to trace the vandalism to
Berkeley students.
Blue and gold paint was
smeared on the statues of Mel
nandro and Fede at the Museum.
A gold "C" was crudely painted
at Hoover Tower. According to
campus policc, who narrowly
missed catching the vandals, the
raid occurred about 11 p.m.
It seemed to Stanford officials
that the raiders were in a hurry.
Brushes were apparently not
used—at Hoover Tower the paint
had been simply poured on the
ground in the shape of a "C."
The vandals left four empty
paint containers behind. They
were quart cans of a high-grade
house paint. Police believe there
may be a possibility of tracing
the purchase of the cans.

left on an editor's desk at the

while we were down there one of
our members happened to spill
some paint on one of the slats to
ward the top of the stairs toward
Hoover Tower. It also seems that
this paint just happened to fall on
the ground in the outline of a "C."
We are indeed sorry about this
little accident, especially since this
is Big Game Week. Perhaps no one
will notice our little accident."
There was no signature on the
note.
The freshmen are not guarding
any parts of the campus this year
except the bonfire. Frosh guards
on duty Monday niftht reported a
group of about eight people who
were seen sneaking through the
lake bed about 11. They were
frightened away, and it is be
lieved they may have been upper
classmen trying to sabotage the
Lake Lagunita bonfire.
A patrolman on duty discovered
the Hoover Tower painting while
the paint was still wet a few mo
ments after 11. It is believed the
vandals were at the Museum at the
very moment he was reporting the
first case of vandalism.
Officials said that while the Hoo
ver Tower sidewalk paint can be
easily eradicated, the job of remov
ing the paint from the statues is a
difficult one. Authorities were un
able -to estimate what the probable
expense will be.
Dean of Students at Stanford H.
Donald Winbigler said he will report
the violation of the non-aggression
pact to California officials this
morning. He said he has been
proud of the conduct of Stanford
students this year.
"To the best of my knowledge,
no Stanford students have at
tempted retaliation at Berkeley,"
he said. "Of course it only takes
j one or two students to make the
entire school look had. Hut I am
[ confident out school will keep the
pact."
According to Winbigler, Califor
nia will probably pay the damage
repair costs.
