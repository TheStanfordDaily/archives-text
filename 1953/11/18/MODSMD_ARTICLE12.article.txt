# IFC Decision Upon Rushing Due Tonight
## 
### 
A decision on the proposed spring
rushing and on two other changes
in rushing procedure are scheduled
to be reached tonight by the Inter
fraternity Council. Proposed a week
ago by the IFC, these rushing re
visions were discussed Monday night
in fraternity house meetings and by
the Interfaith Council.
Tonight, the 22 fraternity presi
dents will convenc again to vote on
the proposals.
Any decision readied at to
night's meting will not be neces
sarily binding on (he eating clubs.
II is expected, however, that the
Inner Club Council will consider
the proposed plan further and most
likely will go along with any
change adopted by the IFC.
The changes in rushing under con
sideration are:
1. Postponement of rushing ac
tivities to spring quarter.
2. Elimination of vacation rush
ing.
Revision of the actual rushing
schedule.
These three revisions originated in
a three-man IFC subcommittee set
up to investigate rushing procedures.
A recent IFC bulletin lists the
following reasons why spring
rushing would be good:
1. The freshmen would benefit
because they would be better ad
justed to their studies by spring,
woidd know more about what they
want in college, and would he
more stabilized as a class.
2. There would be less pledge
breaking.
:5. Fraternity costs on the whole
would be less.
4. A more effective pledge period
is possible because rushing would
be concentrated in one quarter
instead of two.
5. There is a possibility of win
ter initiation, which would give
pledges time to know tbe house
better before being* initiated.
The bulletin also enumerated var- I
ious disadvantages to the new pro- I
gram:
1. There would be a possibility of
illegal rushing.
2. There would be a possibility of
too much "package" pledging.
3. There are more campus activi
ties spring quarter.
4. There would be less time for
picking up pledges after formal
rushing ends.
5. Pledges would have less time to
get to know the house.
The proposed change in the rush
ing schedule would reduce the total
rush period to about one and one
half weeks. Open houses would be
from Wednesday night through Sun
day afternoon, and formal rushing
would take place Sunday night to j
11 a.m. Saturday morning at which j
time pledge cards would be signed.
Rushing at Stanford has changed
quite frequently from time to time
over the years. Fifteen years ago,
rushing took place in the fall. There
were eight rush periods of two days ;
each from Oct. 15 to Jan. 15 plus j
Thanksgiving and Christmas vaca
tions.
In 1941, rushing was officially de
ferred until winter quarter. During
the next year or two, no off-campus
rushing was allowed except at
Christmas.
Fraternities almost ceased to ex
ist during the latter part of the war.
There were no fraternity houses, just
groups of a few men, due to the fact
that the former fraternity houses
were rented by the University as
boarding houses. During this time
there was no IFC and rushing could
go on at any time.
When fraternity houses reopened
in 194(5-47, winter rushing returned
and soon off-campus rushing was
permitted. This policy has remained
about the same to the present.

would be less.
4. A more effective pledge period
is possible because rushing would
be concentrated in one quarter
instead of two.
5. There is a possibility of win
ter initiation, which would give
pledges time to know tbe house
better before being* initiated.
The bulletin also enumerated var- I
ious disadvantages to the new pro- I
gram:
1. There would be a possibility of
illegal rushing.
2. There would be a possibility of
too much "package" pledging.
3. There are more campus activi
ties spring quarter.
4. There would be less time for
picking up pledges after formal
rushing ends.
5. Pledges would have less time to
get to know the house.
The proposed change in the rush
ing schedule would reduce the total
rush period to about one and one
half weeks. Open houses would be
from Wednesday night through Sun
day afternoon, and formal rushing
would take place Sunday night to j
11 a.m. Saturday morning at which j
time pledge cards would be signed.
Rushing at Stanford has changed
quite frequently from time to time
over the years. Fifteen years ago,
rushing took place in the fall. There
were eight rush periods of two days ;
each from Oct. 15 to Jan. 15 plus j
Thanksgiving and Christmas vaca
tions.
In 1941, rushing was officially de
ferred until winter quarter. During
the next year or two, no off-campus
rushing was allowed except at
Christmas.
Fraternities almost ceased to ex
ist during the latter part of the war.
There were no fraternity houses, just
groups of a few men, due to the fact
that the former fraternity houses
were rented by the University as
boarding houses. During this time
there was no IFC and rushing could
go on at any time.
When fraternity houses reopened
in 194(5-47, winter rushing returned
and soon off-campus rushing was
permitted. This policy has remained
about the same to the present.
A decision on the proposed spring
rushing and on two other changes
in rushing procedure are scheduled
to be reached tonight by the Inter
fraternity Council. Proposed a week
ago by the IFC, these rushing re
visions were discussed Monday night
in fraternity house meetings and by
the Interfaith Council.
Tonight, the 22 fraternity presi
dents will convenc again to vote on
the proposals.
Any decision readied at to
night's meting will not be neces
sarily binding on (he eating clubs.
II is expected, however, that the
Inner Club Council will consider
the proposed plan further and most
likely will go along with any
change adopted by the IFC.
The changes in rushing under con
sideration are:
1. Postponement of rushing ac
tivities to spring quarter.
2. Elimination of vacation rush
ing.
Revision of the actual rushing
schedule.
These three revisions originated in
a three-man IFC subcommittee set
up to investigate rushing procedures.
A recent IFC bulletin lists the
following reasons why spring
rushing would be good:
1. The freshmen would benefit
because they would be better ad
justed to their studies by spring,
woidd know more about what they
want in college, and would he
more stabilized as a class.
