## Miller Talks On Hamilton 
### BILL WRIGHT 
The influence of Alexander Hamil
ton upon the early development of
United States constitutional govern
ment was analyzed by historian John
C. Miller last night in the Tuesday
Evening Series lecture in Memorial
Auditorium.
Miller, a professor of the Stanford
History Department and an expert
on colonial history, called Hamilton
"as controversial a figure as a biog
rapher could desire."
Refuting (he widely-believed
idea that Hamilton sought to turn
America into a monarchy and a so
ciety run for the wealthy few.
Miller said (hat Hamilton "sought
a balance between classes, a bal
ance between sections, and a bal
ance in economy."
The misunderstanding arises, Mil
ler said, because Hamilton, in an un
compromising quest for American
economic nationalism and strong
centra! government, "failed to ap
preciate the importance of such non
economic principles as southern
pride, southern distrust of business
men, and southerners' confidence in
their way of life.
"Hamilton was a man of absolute
integrity," Miller stated. He h;id no
second love; for him there was only
the Union. And for this he gave his
life.
"His ideal was government based
upon the people," Miller continued,
but at the same time above the
people" because "the people, in
Hamilton's eye, were lost (o na
tionalism."
Miller said Hamilton stood for
"centralized power, strong executive
leadership, and a wide range of con
stitutional power" in a government
where there would be "a perfect
balance between liberty and power."
Miller concluded by asking,
"Where would the world be today
strong government of the United
without the industrialization and
States? Just to ask that question
justifies the work of Alexander
Hamilton."
