# Funny, Fast Gaieties Open In Mem Aud
## 
### JERRY SIMPSON 
Working with a spirit of an
ticipation of the Big Game tus
sle, Ram's Head has come up
with a Gaieties show which is
for the most part highly enter
taining and which magnificent
ly sets a fast pace for the week's
whirl of Big Game activities.
The show got of! to a rousing
start before a large and apprecia
tive audience at last night's opener
in Memorial Auditorium.
Highlight of the opening number
was a pleasing number of feminine
lovelies dressed in bizarre costumes
which were calculated to prove that
"it takes a dame to sell a show," the
theme of the production. This num
ber befan a lively pace for the show
which, unfortunately, was not sus
tained throughout the perform
ance.
The show slowed down in a
couple of spots, particularly in the
biggest part of the scene "The
Four-Thousandth Production" and
"The Bear and the Indian." Much
of this slowness was due to a weak
book for these particular numbers.
One of the vocal highlights of
the evening was the song styling
of Ruth Daniels. Her rendition of
"Yesterday's Love" had a nostal
gic and dramatic quality of pro
fessional caliber.
Other outstanding vocal perform
ances were given by Bill Burke and
Shirley Johnson in the "Brighton
Bathers" scene. This sequence was
a parody of a Gilbert and Sullivan
opera, and Miss Johnson's soprano
and Burke's tenor were effective in
this semi - operatic singing. The
comic number was hardly the place
for a good display of their talent,
but the voices were nevertheless
easily heard and were pleasing to
hear.
The fillers (short .skits before the
curtain given while scenery is be
ing changed) were for the most
part very unfunny. Two exceptions
were the skit about five-dimension
al movies and the fond farewells at
the Roble door in the senior and
freshman style.
The rest of the show is packed
with comical situations and in
dividual performances which arc
screamingly funny.
Comedian Hon Fein berg gets
my vote as one of the best funny
men in the production. His facial
expressions in the dumb cow
puncher role of "The James
Brothers" scene are hysterical,
and his parts in several other
scenes add greatly to the success
of the show. This particular scene,
incidentally, was one of the best
comic scenes of the series and
had consistently good punch lines.
Another able comic was Tony
Stevens, who played the part of
Hamlet's mother in a burlesque of
the play entitled "I. Hamlet."
Set designs were particularly col
orful and well executed. The set
for "Side Street in Gotham" was
one of the best in the show and was
«onvincing. The lighting in this
.•lumber helped to create a perfect
etting for a dance routine featuring
.ludy Dickinson and the ensemble.
Costumes were generally well
designed. Costumes for the waltz
number were the most outstand
ing. Numerous approvals were
heard when the lights were
dimmed and the women's skirts
burst into a mass of twinkling
lights which glittered as the
dancers waltzed.
This scenc was artistically the
t " t of the show. Good sets, good
lighting, ;ind an excellent dance
routine were combined to give the
high point of the show. Here, too,
the best display ol the choreog
rapher's talent.
Music for the show was good,
liummable, and foot - tappable.

theme of the production. This num
ber befan a lively pace for the show
which, unfortunately, was not sus
tained throughout the perform
ance.
The show slowed down in a
couple of spots, particularly in the
biggest part of the scene "The
Four-Thousandth Production" and
"The Bear and the Indian." Much
of this slowness was due to a weak
book for these particular numbers.
One of the vocal highlights of
the evening was the song styling
of Ruth Daniels. Her rendition of
"Yesterday's Love" had a nostal
gic and dramatic quality of pro
fessional caliber.
Other outstanding vocal perform
ances were given by Bill Burke and
Shirley Johnson in the "Brighton
Bathers" scene. This sequence was
a parody of a Gilbert and Sullivan
opera, and Miss Johnson's soprano
and Burke's tenor were effective in
this semi - operatic singing. The
comic number was hardly the place
for a good display of their talent,
but the voices were nevertheless
easily heard and were pleasing to
hear.
The fillers (short .skits before the
curtain given while scenery is be
ing changed) were for the most
part very unfunny. Two exceptions
were the skit about five-dimension
al movies and the fond farewells at
the Roble door in the senior and
freshman style.
The rest of the show is packed
with comical situations and in
dividual performances which arc
screamingly funny.
Comedian Hon Fein berg gets
my vote as one of the best funny
men in the production. His facial
expressions in the dumb cow
puncher role of "The James
Brothers" scene are hysterical,
and his parts in several other
scenes add greatly to the success
of the show. This particular scene,
incidentally, was one of the best
comic scenes of the series and
had consistently good punch lines.
Another able comic was Tony
Stevens, who played the part of
Hamlet's mother in a burlesque of
the play entitled "I. Hamlet."
Set designs were particularly col
orful and well executed. The set
for "Side Street in Gotham" was
one of the best in the show and was
«onvincing. The lighting in this
.•lumber helped to create a perfect
etting for a dance routine featuring
.ludy Dickinson and the ensemble.
Costumes were generally well
designed. Costumes for the waltz
number were the most outstand
ing. Numerous approvals were
heard when the lights were
dimmed and the women's skirts
burst into a mass of twinkling
lights which glittered as the
dancers waltzed.
This scenc was artistically the
t " t of the show. Good sets, good
lighting, ;ind an excellent dance
routine were combined to give the
high point of the show. Here, too,
the best display ol the choreog
rapher's talent.
Music for the show was good,
liummable, and foot - tappable.
Working with a spirit of an
ticipation of the Big Game tus
sle, Ram's Head has come up
with a Gaieties show which is
for the most part highly enter
taining and which magnificent
ly sets a fast pace for the week's
whirl of Big Game activities.
The show got of! to a rousing
start before a large and apprecia
tive audience at last night's opener
in Memorial Auditorium.
Highlight of the opening number
was a pleasing number of feminine
lovelies dressed in bizarre costumes
which were calculated to prove that
"it takes a dame to sell a show," the
theme of the production. This num
ber befan a lively pace for the show
