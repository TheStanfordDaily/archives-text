# Second Jet Still Missing
## 
### 
Search for the jet fighter reported
missing after its wingmate crashed
near Rudy's Alpine Inn Monday
afternoon will continue at full
strength today.
A six-man ground party from the
Santa Clara County ShcriiT's Office
was sent on a "wild goose chase" last
night after one of the searching
planes reported sighting wreckage
high on the slopes of Mount Hamil
ton at 5 p.m. yesterday.
They reported the wreckage as
that of a plane which crashed over
a year and a half ago.
Flights of 20 to 25 Navy, Coast
Guard, Air Force, and Civil Air Pa
trol planes made a concentrated
search of the area from San Francis
co south to Monterey yesterday,
with the false alarm on Mount Ham
ilton as the only result.
The pilot of the missing plane has
been identified as Ensign Robert L.
Fishburn. His parents arc now at
Moffctt Field Naval Air Station
awaiting any news of their son.
Meanwhile, Lieutenant Com
mander Clyde J. Lee, who para
chuted from his stricken F2H Ban
shee jet fighter Monday Iwforc it
plowed into a hillside about 500
yards ofT Alpine Road, is rcstuji:
easily at Oak Knoll Naval Hospital
in Oakland. He is said to have suf
fered back injuries. A resident of
Palo Alto, he is a veteran of World
War II and was awarded the Navy
Cross for his action in the Pacific.
The two planes, both high
powered jet craft, look ofT from
MofTctl Field on a routine training
flight to lallon, Nevada, at 2:(K»
p.m. Monday.
At about 2:10 p.m. the jet piloted
by Lee streaked from the brooding
clouds that hung over most of the
coastal mountains, swept low along
Arastradero Road, zoomed up into
the clouds again, and then plum
meted into the hillside where it
disintegrated.
Lee bailed out, using an explosive
powered ejection seat, when the
plane first dove below the clouds
over the Page Mill Quarry.
He later said that he parachuted
when the cockpit filled with smoke
and he was unable to control the
plane.
Naval authorities at MofTctt
Field rilled out the theory that the
two planes might have collided in
mid-air after questioning Lee yes
terday. Lee said that Fishburn saw
that he was in trouble and veered
off to the south.
The search for the second plane
was instituted when no word was
received from Fishhurn after he
radioed that he had lost contact with
Lee.
The hunt for the missing plane and
pilot was called off during the past
two nights because of darkness.
What was mistakenly thought to
be the wreckage of Fishburn's
plane was sighted near the Mount
of San Jose.
The party from the Sheriff's Office
proceeded on foot to the spot, ar
riving at about 9 p.m. last night,
and reported by radio that the
wreckage was not that of the miss
! ing plane.

At about 2:10 p.m. the jet piloted
by Lee streaked from the brooding
clouds that hung over most of the
coastal mountains, swept low along
Arastradero Road, zoomed up into
the clouds again, and then plum
meted into the hillside where it
disintegrated.
Lee bailed out, using an explosive
powered ejection seat, when the
plane first dove below the clouds
over the Page Mill Quarry.
He later said that he parachuted
when the cockpit filled with smoke
and he was unable to control the
plane.
Naval authorities at MofTctt
Field rilled out the theory that the
two planes might have collided in
mid-air after questioning Lee yes
terday. Lee said that Fishburn saw
that he was in trouble and veered
off to the south.
The search for the second plane
was instituted when no word was
received from Fishhurn after he
radioed that he had lost contact with
Lee.
The hunt for the missing plane and
pilot was called off during the past
two nights because of darkness.
What was mistakenly thought to
be the wreckage of Fishburn's
plane was sighted near the Mount

Guard, Air Force, and Civil Air Pa
trol planes made a concentrated
