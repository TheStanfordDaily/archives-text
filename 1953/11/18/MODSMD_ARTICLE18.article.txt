### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 (UP)—FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover
testified today that former President Truinan "hampered" 115!
efforts to keep track of Harry Dexter White by moving the alleged
spy to an agency where the FBI lacked jurisdiction.
Hoover also told the Senate Internal Security subcommittee

♦he warned then Attorney General
Tom C. Clark on Feb. 21, 194(5, that
it was "unwise" for White to servi
on the International Monetary Fun ;.
That was before White assumed hi.,
duties on May 1, 194G.
Hoover made a dramatic, surprise
appearance before the subcommittee
after Attorney General Herbert
Brownell, Jr., accused Mr. Truman
of doing nothing to "interfere" with
with the White spy ring after decid
ing to keep White in government.
Brownell also declared that Mr.
Truman and "others around him"
were unwilling to face the facts of
Rod infiltration into the govern
ment. He said their "delusion"
may have caused this country
great harm.
Brownell and Hoover noted that
two other Red suspects named in re
ports—Frank Coe and Harold Gin -
ser—followed White into the Mone
tary Fund. Brownell said this could
not have happened if the Truman
administration was keeping a elo. e
eye on White. Mr. Truman had "no
comment" on the latest charges.
With more than 500 spectators
jammed into the 300-scat marble
pillared Senate caucus room, Hoover
declared that between Nov. 8, 1045,
and July 24, 1946, seven FBI espion -
age reports went to the White Hon:
specifically mentioning White by
name.
"During the same time, two
summaries on Soviet espionage ac
tivities went to the Treasury [><•-
partmcnt and six summaries went
to the Attorney General on t!it
same subject matter," lie testified.

concerned," Hoover answered.

tional organization, like the United
Nations, the FBI has no jitrisdie
tion there, Hoover pointed on I.
