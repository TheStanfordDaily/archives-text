# Roble Women Began Big Game Bonfire Tradition
## 
### DAVID SCOTT 
Tomorrow's Big Game bonfire
at Lake Lagunita, which was al
most blown up by Cal students
two weeks ago, is a tradition
which dates clear back to 1898.
Roble women were responsible
for the first bonfire in 1898. The
day before the Big Game, they be
came anxious to hold a rally and
outdoor "warm-up," so they had
the Stanford men collect a pile of
barrels for a fire, which was built
near Roble.
The scene of the conflagration
has been shifted many times. It
has been located in the baseball
field, the field neav Brainier and
the gym, and the present site of
Lake Lagunita. In 1911 the blaze 1
was ignited right in the middle of
the Inner Quad.
In the 'twenties, almost every
year a woodpile sabotage was at
tempted. In 1922 UC students went
so'far as to drop aerial bombs from
an overhead airplane. Other unsuc
cessful attempts were in '20, '23. and
'24.
In 1928 it was a different story,
however. It was Wednesday morn
ing and students were going to their
ten o'clock classes. At 9:55 a few
observant students noticed flames
from the direction of Lake Lagu
nita.
A warning whistle was blown and !
students and faculty alike forgot
about classes and rushed toward the
disaster scene. Early arrivals found
the blaze rapidly growing while a
scant half-dozen frosh guards stood
aghast, staring at the rising smoke
and lire.
At eleven o'clock the word was
passed around, "The bonfire is in
ashes."
"Let's rebuild it." cried a fresh
man as the fire neared its end.
The spirit caught on and before I
any member of the Rally Com
mittee was there to organize it,
everybody was at work collecting j
materials for a new and better i
wood pile.
The problem facing the students
was almost staggering. It was less
than 3G hours before the traditional
rally. A similar occasion had oc
curred three years before in 1925,
but the freshman class had been
twice the size of the present one.
Consequently all classes for the
rest of Wednesday and all ol Thurs
day were called oil' and the whole
student body pitched in to help.
The bonfire was very precisely
planned by Farm engineering stu
dents.
An appeal for wood was aired
over KPO (now KN'BC) and the
citizens of the area responded
magnificently, contributing piles
of wood, telephone poles, and
even chopped-up outhouses.
By rally time the bonfire was
completely rebuilt and was (50 feet
high, 10 feet higher than before the
sabotage.
However, the Stanford men have
n't been completely free of mischief
themselves. In 1904 some ingenious
Stanfordites stole the senior fence
from the Cal campus and brought
it around the Bay to the Farm.
Needless to say the fence was one
of the principal ingredients of the
Big Game bonfire that year.
The fence was thrown in the
flames without ceremony and the
Stanford men joined arms and ser
pentined around the blaze as one of
California's most cherished tradi
tions went up in smoke.
In 1929. after the famous Tooner
ville Trolley had made its last run,
Stanford .students wanted to stage a
cremation of the popular red car as
their bonfire, but they were re
fused. Instead the Southern Pacific
Railroad contributed a huge stack of
railroad ties, 20 feet long and eight
feet high.
During the war years, a new
problem was presented. Since
there was no game with Cal.'what
would happen to the Big Game
fire? The students solved this
problem by holding their bonfire
rally before the Stanford - Mer
chant Marine game.
Many traditions have been formed
since the first fire was built way
back during the year of the Span
ish-American war. Each freshman
class has striven to build the fire
higher than the class which pre
ceded it.
In 1924 the class of '28 built the
pile to a height of 79 feet, a record
which stood for many years. Then
in 1951 the class of '55's fire attained
the fantastic height of 85 feet.
A new tradition is being started
I this year. In past years the frosh
j class has started to build the fire
almost as soon as they were regis
tered in the University. This year
| the actual building did not start
until 48 hours before rally time.
By this new system, the height

(o which a class builds a fire in
48 hours can be compared fairly
with the height to which a fol
lowing class builds it in the same
period of time. Also, more spirit
and enthusiasm for building a fire
can he generated in a short pe
riod of time rather than several
weeks.
It might be mentioned here that
the Cal students also have a pre-
Big Game rally around a fire on
Thursday night. However, this fire,
built in the Greek Amphitheater,
has not the tradition of the Stanford
blaze, and there is no striving to
build it higher every year, as is
done on the Farm.
