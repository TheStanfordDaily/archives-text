# PUNTS AND PITCHES
## The 						Drought Will End 
### Pete Grothe 
As the man said as he released the atom bomb oti Hiroshima, "This is I
it. Verily, this is IT. The 1953 edition of the Big Game is about as IT as i
you eon net. For Stanford, it's the most important Big Game since the j
war.
In fact, it's the most important tussle that Stanford.has engaged in since
thi» \a/:h* fnr Ohp if urine

me war mr several reasons, une, u aiamord wins,
it will probably go to the Rose Bowl. Two, the Indians
haven't won for seven years, too long a drought for
anyone to take, particularly for the nine seniors on
the starting team who won't be able to say, "Wait until
next year.' Three, il the Cards win. it will make the
'53 aggregation the greatest rags to riches outfit in
Stanford football history.
The Cards have a better chance to win Saturday ]
than in any Big Game since they started losing in 1947. |
This is why:
As Cal Coach Pappy Waldorf stated Monday, Stan-

lord has the best passing attack in the nation. And there is no defense
lor the perfect pass. Although Boh Garrett is not perfect, he comes closer
to it than any other dinger in the country, having already set a flock of
records and being on the verge of cracking a few more. He leads the
nation in passing completions, yardage, and percentage. The soft-spoken
San Marino tow-head has connected on iust a shade under (iO per cent of
his throws, an amazing mark.
Garrett has the top three receivers in the PCC to throw to in Morley, i
Steinberg, and Cook. Stanford's aerial attack clicked at its best against !
UCLA and USC, who have the best pass defenses in the conference. It
should go even better against the Bears who have very short pass de
lenders, and who have been proven vulnerable to a solid passing attack.
However, the Bears will probably present a different type pass defense
than UCLA and USC did. The latter two only rushed four or five men,
while Cal is expected to rush seven. They did against Washington, which
lias an attack similar to Stanford's. If Cal does rush that many, it will make
thriii susceptible to short passes. It will mean that Garrett can eight and '
ten yard the Bears to death.
An over-anxiousness on the Bears' part to halt Stanford's air game
will be a good set-up for our running game, which is not as dormant as
most people think. Against the Trojans, Stanford averaged more per play
on the ground than USC did. Also, most coaches who have opposed Cal
oncl Stanford leel that Cal's line is weaker defensively than Stanford's,
although they give the Berkeley team credit for a better offensive line
charge.
Taylor, the coach with the boyish grin, has stated that Stanford will
score at least three touchdowns. They did against USC and UCLA, which
are stronger defensively than Cal, so there is no reason to believe they "
won't against the Bears. Particularly, since the Indians are in their best
physical shape of the season.
And so, Stanford's big problem this week is to stop Cal. If the Indians
can hold the invaders to two touchdowns, they can probably win. The 11
strategy this week is to improve the pursuit defense. In other words, to j
put the pressure on Paul Larson so that he can't wreck the Indians on his I
optional pass-run patterns. Highly secret practices this week have been
aimed at setting up special defenses to stop Cal's particular pattern of J
offensive, play.
The coaches have been pleased with the progress this week, so pleased |
that they called off contact work a night before they usually do.
The desire on the part of Ihe players was higher Monday night than
we've ever seen it.
The Stanford Indian will break the seven year drought four days hence. !

most people think. Against the Trojans, Stanford averaged more per play
on the ground than USC did. Also, most coaches who have opposed Cal
oncl Stanford leel that Cal's line is weaker defensively than Stanford's,
although they give the Berkeley team credit for a better offensive line
charge.
Taylor, the coach with the boyish grin, has stated that Stanford will
score at least three touchdowns. They did against USC and UCLA, which
are stronger defensively than Cal, so there is no reason to believe they "
won't against the Bears. Particularly, since the Indians are in their best
physical shape of the season.
And so, Stanford's big problem this week is to stop Cal. If the Indians
can hold the invaders to two touchdowns, they can probably win. The 11
strategy this week is to improve the pursuit defense. In other words, to j
put the pressure on Paul Larson so that he can't wreck the Indians on his I
optional pass-run patterns. Highly secret practices this week have been
aimed at setting up special defenses to stop Cal's particular pattern of J
offensive, play.
The coaches have been pleased with the progress this week, so pleased |
that they called off contact work a night before they usually do.

This is why:
As Cal Coach Pappy Waldorf stated Monday, Stan-

lord has the best passing attack in the nation. And there is no defense
lor the perfect pass. Although Boh Garrett is not perfect, he comes closer
to it than any other dinger in the country, having already set a flock of
records and being on the verge of cracking a few more. He leads the
nation in passing completions, yardage, and percentage. The soft-spoken
San Marino tow-head has connected on iust a shade under (iO per cent of
his throws, an amazing mark.
Garrett has the top three receivers in the PCC to throw to in Morley, i
Steinberg, and Cook. Stanford's aerial attack clicked at its best against !
UCLA and USC, who have the best pass defenses in the conference. It
should go even better against the Bears who have very short pass de
lenders, and who have been proven vulnerable to a solid passing attack.
However, the Bears will probably present a different type pass defense
than UCLA and USC did. The latter two only rushed four or five men,
while Cal is expected to rush seven. They did against Washington, which
lias an attack similar to Stanford's. If Cal does rush that many, it will make
thriii susceptible to short passes. It will mean that Garrett can eight and '
ten yard the Bears to death.
An over-anxiousness on the Bears' part to halt Stanford's air game
will be a good set-up for our running game, which is not as dormant as
most people think. Against the Trojans, Stanford averaged more per play
on the ground than USC did. Also, most coaches who have opposed Cal
