# Garrett and Manoogian Named All-American
## 
### 
Some of the All-American teams
are out already and Stanford has
players on them. Bob Garrett was
picked on Tom Harmon's mythical
team, while Norm Manoogian made
the People's Today magazine eleven
and the UP Fearless Fraley second
squad.
In his selection of Garrett, Har
mon called Bob "the greatest col.
lege passer in 20 years since Sammy
Baugh," and said that "any All -
American team that doesn't include
him is a farce."
