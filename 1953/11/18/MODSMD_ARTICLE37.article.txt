### STEVE HILL 
Phi Delt I continued undefeated in intramural football this year
by knocking off the previously once-beaten Toyon East sguad,
26-0, in the second day of mural playoffs.
Jim Cairns, sharp-shooting Phi Delt tailback, sparked his team's
offense with a top passing perfoimance. He threw for three

touchdowns and two extra points,
and compiled a total of 179 yards
passing on 10 completions in 19 at
tempts. Cairns' favorite targets were
ends Doug Shumway and Neil Papi
ano, who each had three receptions.
The Phi Delts scored once in the
first half for a 7-0 edge at half
time. Gary Gray, Phi I)el( half
hack, set up the tally with an
interception at midfield. It took
only three plays for the Delts to
cover the distance. Shumway
grabbing an aerial from Cairns for
the TD, and then Papiano another
for the conversion.
Early in the second half the even
tual winners struck again. This time,
on a play good for three yards, Papi
ano snatched a partially-deflected
pass from Cairns in the corner of
the end zone, and Gray a short toss
for the extra point.
A short time later Phi Delt stopped
Toyon on the Delt 15, and on the
first play after taking over, Cairns
heaved a long pass to Papiano who
sprinted down the left sideline all
the way to give his teammates a
20-0 lead. A pass for the conversion
was incomplete.
The victors added their last
touchdown late in the game when
Gray intercepted an errant Toyon
pass on his own 30 yard line and,
with the aid of a key block by Don
Clark, negotiated the distance of
50 yards. Again the extra point
pass was no good. The contest
ended a few minutes later with the
out-manned Toyon outfit in their
own territory.
Other mural playoff action saw
Phi Kap 1 defeat Los Arcos, 19-6,

KA I clown Fiji. 19-0, and Fire
house heat Phi Delt 11, 13-6.
