# Spirit Grows: 'Lick the Bear'
## 
### 
The California Bear really gets
licked today—in a sweet sort of
way.
It's "Lick the Bear Day"' on Quad,
and yellow suckers will be passed
out at the Post Office, in front of
Union, and in front of the Main Li
brary. Red and white "Beat Cal"
buttons will also be distributed.
Dodging midterms and draft tests,
the frosh will start piling up the
lumber in Lake Lagunita today. The
"Big Push" is on and will continue
until rally time tomorrow night.
Big Game enthusiasm is evident
elsewhere, too. The statues in front
of the Stanford Museum have been
doused with blue and gold paint.
Police aren't sure, but evidence
points toward local, rather than
Berkeley-based, painters.
Some members of Rally Com have
a unique plan for getting under the
Golden Bear's hide. They are taking
up contributions in order to place a
full-page advertisement in Thurs
day's Berkeley Gazette. Something
friendly, like a big "BEAT CAL."
Russell women are showing true
spirit, at least from a hasher's view
point. They arc foregoing Saturday
night dinner so that the little men
in white coats who serve them can
have the evening free.
Some students are so sure of the
outcome of the game that they're
stocking up on sympathy cards to
send to deserving Blue and Gold
supporters. The Bookstore has cards
with appropriate sentiments avail
able for anyone interested.
for most students, however,
there's a spectre more threatening
than Pappy Waldorf — Midterms.
