Well-Known Reindeer Tells All
NORTH POLE, ARCTIC. Looking very dapper for
an 18-point buck with chalked muzzle and matching
white tail assembly, Dasher, famous front-running
reindeer for the S. Claus Parcel Service, stated today:
1. Conditions on the northern tundra are pretty
much the same as ever. No-o, TV hadn't affected
the grazing habits of the middle-class herds.
2. That despite reports to the contrary, you
don't ever thoroughly adjust to sub-zero weather,
regardless of the warm esteem people hold you in.
3. Rumors of a reindeer strike for Christmas Hve
are unfounded. Somebody's got a termite in his
antler.
When asked about the most popular Christmas gift
down through the years he replied without hesitation:
"Menswear by Manhattan. I've helped haul Mr.
Claus's sled, roe and buck, nigh unto forever ... so I
ought to know . . . nothing makes a man happier than
shirts, sportshirts, ties, pajamas, beach wear or under
wear labeled Manhattan. Don't know whether it's the
live style that makes a man look and feel so good,
whether it's the traditional tailoring detail, or the
array of fabrics, patterns and colors that are all so
unmistakeably quality. I'll admit one thing. I've kind
of wished sometimes that Manhattan would make
deer wear."
