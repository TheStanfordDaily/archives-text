# Card Halfback In Draft Row
## 
### 
A United Press dispatch reported
last night that a warrant of arrest
has been issued for A 1 Napoleon,
Stanford's flashy second - string
halfback, on the charge of violating
the Selective Service law.
The warrant was issued in Hono
lulu, Napoleon's home town.
United States Attorney A. Wil
liam Barlow in Honolulu said, "I am
perfectly willing to forget the
charges if Napoleon agrees to im
mediate induction into the Army.
If lie chooses to fight the issue, then
I'll prosecute, but after all we arc
merely interested in seeing that he
abides by Selective Service laws."
However, Acting Chief Counselor
of Men Robert P. HufT said, "I don't
think Napoleon is in any trouble."
HufT has sent three letters to Na
poleon's Honolulu draft board since
the halfback entered school last
spring. HUff is reviewing all the
papers and will advise Napoleon to
day what to do.
The UP report said that Barlow
revealed that the Stanford halfback
is classified IA and failed to report
for induction on July 15.
However, Napoleon seemed sur
prised by the notice of the warrant,
which he has not yet received. He
told Baekfield Coach Pete Kmcto
vic that lie had never received an
induction notice, and so he didn't
see h'ow he was evading the draft.
Two weeks ago, the FBI contacted
Chuck Taylor and told him to send
Napoleon to San Jose to check on
the matter. Napoleon did, and sent
a letter to his draft board. Last Fri
day Napoleon received a letter from
Honolulu which stated that his case
had been turned over to the U.S.
Attorney. It didn't tell him why or
if he should report.
It isn't known officially whether
Napoleon will be able to play in
this Saturday's game. Most observ
ers feel that he will, even if he pre
sents himself for induction at the
Presidio, since induction is usually
delayed several days.
