# Freshman Suffers Fractured Skull
## 
### 
Russell Kccly, an Encina fresh
man, suffered a fractured skull last
night as the result of an accident
while working on the bonfire.
Kccly was working on one of the
ladders on a side of the bonfire
passing up wood. A freshman lost
control of one log being raised and
it dropped on Kccly. He was taken
to the Palo Alto Hospital, where his
condition was termed "satisfactory."
