# CARD SPIRITS SOARING
## Medics Say Smith Fit For Big Tilt 
### PETE GROTHE Sports Editor, The Daily 
Team spirit soared to a new
high last night when it was
announced that tackle Barry
Smith, thought to be out of the
Big Game, will be a starter after
all.
Smith was hit on the head Tu<
day night, and the medics thought
that his football career was over.
But a re-examination yesterday
morning revealed that Smith had
only been slightly shaken up, and
that he will be in top shape thi:;
Saturday.
The emphasis in practice last
night was on passing and pass
protection, which surprised ab
solutely no one. It's no sccret thai
the Indians arc going to fill the air
with passes Saturday.
Although rain is predicted for to
day, the advance weather report in
dicates that the skies will be glori ■
ously blue on the day when it';
most important that they are that
way, namely, Saturday.
The spirit was exceedingly high
last night as cries of "Beat Cal''
echoed in bass and baritone off the
practice field walls.
Those same walls have been
heavily guarded this week, as Tay
lor has issud orders that no one but
reporters and the most trustworthy
alumni should be admitted to prac
tice.
One of the key notes of practice
this week has been t<> "stop Lar
son." The players have been in
formed that Paul Larson, Oil's
junior quarterback, is the back
bone of the Cal attack. They
have further been told that as
goes Larson, so goes the Cal at
tack.
The Turlock Hash is a very adept
runner and when trapped can often
wiggle off the hook and make lar;«
gains. He passes with an unortbo
dox style, twisting his whole body
when he throws.
Larson, who is I7. r > pounds and
five-eleven, is (bird in the nation
.in total offense, three yards be
hind the man who is second . . .
Stanford's Bob Garrett.
But there's more to Cal's .ittaH.
than Larson. Leading a crop of typ
ical California hard-charging h.i!t
backs are A 1 Talley and Don Mark .
Talley, who is only lfjti pound
and five-nine, is very fast. Ifr i
I second in PCC scoring with U
points.
Marks is the Bears' best running
back. He is not outstandingly I'a l
but is powerful and has excellen 1
running sense. Marks has average'
seven yards a carry. He is a top
notch blocker and defensive playrr
Cal's alternating fullbacks arc Jin
Dillon and Steve DimefT, who an
nothing more than average. Botl
are fairly good on power plays but
are vulnerable on defense.
Pappy Waldorf's starting ends,
newcomer Dick Kern and Jim Han
ilan, are better than average de
fensively And as blockers, but aren't
exceptional at pass snagging.
Cal's l>est lineman is center
Matt Hazeltine. who should he

All-American next year. Many
say that he is better than Les
Richter, because he tackles just
as well and is better on pass de
fense.
Captain of the Cal team is guard
Tom Dutton. who is agile and
scrappy, but who only weighs 175
pounds. Dutton often plays end or
tackle on defense, since Waldorf
like to put his heavy men in the
middle of the i;ne when the other
team has the ball.
Dick Day, 215 pounds, is Cal's best
tackle, but he won't be at full ef
fectiveness, since he has a leg in
jury. Jim Kotler, the other tackle,
is a good offensive blocker, but
teams have run against him all
year.
Guard Hal Norris rounds out the
Cal starting lineup. He is excellent
on pulling out and leading end
sweeps and has been average on de
fense.

One of the key notes of practice
this week has been t<> "stop Lar
son." The players have been in
formed that Paul Larson, Oil's
junior quarterback, is the back
bone of the Cal attack. They
have further been told that as
goes Larson, so goes the Cal at
tack.
The Turlock Hash is a very adept
runner and when trapped can often
wiggle off the hook and make lar;«
gains. He passes with an unortbo
dox style, twisting his whole body
when he throws.
Larson, who is I7. r > pounds and
five-eleven, is (bird in the nation
.in total offense, three yards be
hind the man who is second . . .
Stanford's Bob Garrett.
But there's more to Cal's .ittaH.
than Larson. Leading a crop of typ
ical California hard-charging h.i!t
backs are A 1 Talley and Don Mark .
Talley, who is only lfjti pound
and five-nine, is very fast. Ifr i
I second in PCC scoring with U
points.
Marks is the Bears' best running
back. He is not outstandingly I'a l
but is powerful and has excellen 1
running sense. Marks has average'
seven yards a carry. He is a top
notch blocker and defensive playrr
Cal's alternating fullbacks arc Jin
Dillon and Steve DimefT, who an
nothing more than average. Botl
are fairly good on power plays but
are vulnerable on defense.
Pappy Waldorf's starting ends,
newcomer Dick Kern and Jim Han
ilan, are better than average de
fensively And as blockers, but aren't
exceptional at pass snagging.
Cal's l>est lineman is center
Matt Hazeltine. who should he

All-American next year. Many
say that he is better than Les
Richter, because he tackles just
as well and is better on pass de
fense.
Captain of the Cal team is guard
Tom Dutton. who is agile and
scrappy, but who only weighs 175
pounds. Dutton often plays end or
tackle on defense, since Waldorf
like to put his heavy men in the
middle of the i;ne when the other
team has the ball.
Dick Day, 215 pounds, is Cal's best
tackle, but he won't be at full ef
fectiveness, since he has a leg in
jury. Jim Kotler, the other tackle,
is a good offensive blocker, but
teams have run against him all
year.
Guard Hal Norris rounds out the
Cal starting lineup. He is excellent
on pulling out and leading end
sweeps and has been average on de
fense.
Team spirit soared to a new
high last night when it was
announced that tackle Barry
Smith, thought to be out of the
Big Game, will be a starter after
all.
Smith was hit on the head Tu<
day night, and the medics thought
that his football career was over.
But a re-examination yesterday
morning revealed that Smith had
only been slightly shaken up, and
that he will be in top shape thi:;
Saturday.
The emphasis in practice last
night was on passing and pass
protection, which surprised ab
solutely no one. It's no sccret thai
the Indians arc going to fill the air
with passes Saturday.
Although rain is predicted for to
day, the advance weather report in
dicates that the skies will be glori ■
ously blue on the day when it';
most important that they are that
way, namely, Saturday.
The spirit was exceedingly high
last night as cries of "Beat Cal''
echoed in bass and baritone off the
practice field walls.

heavily guarded this week, as Tay
