### PETE GROTHE 
NO WAITING I NTII, VI YE All

A well-known quotation says that there are three
i wers to prayer: one, yes; two, no; and three, w;iit.
a i ven years, Stanford has had to wait.
11. ck in 1946, we were either romping around in our
. ii.'i.n school knickerbockers or acclimatizing our
lv( s to high school's big new world. The year 15)4(i
also the last time that Stan-

ord heal C.J in the Big Game.
In 15)47. Stanford hadn't won a
■ in 11• all year and Cal hadn't lost.
llk '/'lds were 10 to 1. The In
lians led foe 53 minutes, only to
o;;e the game and the Axe in
In- la: t seven minutes, 21 to 18.
Wait until next year," they said.
Next year came, and again
( id was the heavy favorite. And
Cal barely won by the

margin of a toe, 7 to (i. In 194!), over Sports Editor
lnhn Breier's story on how Stanford lost. .'i.'l to 14,
was tlir headline, "Mayhe Next Year."
In 1950, the Indians tied favored Cal, 7 to 7, but the
B< .us slill retained the Axe. Earl Odell wrote the
1951 Big Game story: "Into each life some rain must
112 II ami the fall came hard last Saturday for the
Mighty Stanford Indians, 20 to 7." The Indians would
have to wait until next year.
1, 'iry Calm, now Fort Ording it up, wrote after
la: t. year 2(! to 0 loss, "Stanford seniors didn't see
lln Axe come home." Next year.
Ami so ever since lf)4(>, we have been "waiting

until next year." John Hall, (former Daily Spoils
Editor and Bull Sessioner) said after the l!l game,
"The saddest words I ever did hear were those that
said, 'Wait until next year.' "
And so, at this writing, we don't have to wait
until next year. We only have to wait two-and-a
half more days. For me, there will be no "next year."
Sure, I can come back as an alumnus as soon as the
Army finishes with me, but things won't be quite the
same. It's got to be this year, now, and none of this
"wail 'til next year" Uilk.
1 can think of nine gentlemen in particular who
also won't be able to say, "Wait 'til next year,"—
Moi ley, Steinberg, Smith, Wilson, Manoogian, Tanner,
Garrett, Cook, and Howe. They graduate this June.
And so we come to the question that underlies all
others, "Will Stanford have to wait until next year?"
The answer is a clear and resounding "No!"
Listen to Coach Dutch Fehring, who calls his shots
straight from the shoulder and never says things just
to be saying them: "Has our spirit been high this
week? I'll answer it this way. On Monday night,
after our scrimmage, we held a pass protection and
one-on-one blocking drill. I've never seen football
players go at each other in heavy contact practice as
hard and with as much spirit. There is no doubt about
it. They want to win this one."
Stanford, because it is healthy and mentally-ready
and has the best passing attack in the nation, will
win this Saturday.
And about 5 p.m. Saturday, long-faced Cal rooters
will say, "Wait until next year."

"wail 'til next year" Uilk.
1 can think of nine gentlemen in particular who
also won't be able to say, "Wait 'til next year,"—
Moi ley, Steinberg, Smith, Wilson, Manoogian, Tanner,
Garrett, Cook, and Howe. They graduate this June.
And so we come to the question that underlies all
others, "Will Stanford have to wait until next year?"
The answer is a clear and resounding "No!"
Listen to Coach Dutch Fehring, who calls his shots
straight from the shoulder and never says things just
to be saying them: "Has our spirit been high this
week? I'll answer it this way. On Monday night,
after our scrimmage, we held a pass protection and
one-on-one blocking drill. I've never seen football
players go at each other in heavy contact practice as
hard and with as much spirit. There is no doubt about
it. They want to win this one."
Stanford, because it is healthy and mentally-ready
and has the best passing attack in the nation, will
win this Saturday.
And about 5 p.m. Saturday, long-faced Cal rooters
will say, "Wait until next year."
