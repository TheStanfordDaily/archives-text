NEW MICROWAVE LABâ€”A new 5200,000 Microwave Laooiaiury soon to rise on the Stanford
campus will be one of the world's leading centers of microwave research. Stanford scientists
have already nearly completed the world's largest electron linear accelerator, a billion-volt atom
smasher that speeds electrons at the highest velocity ever achieved on earth. They are now
studying the feasibility of building multi-billion-volt linear accelerators.
