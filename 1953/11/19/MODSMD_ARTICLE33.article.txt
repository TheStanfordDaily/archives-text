# Microwave Research Is Stepped Up
## 
### 
Construction of a new 5200,-
000 microwave laboratory on
the Stanford campus will begin
this month if weather permits,
President Wallace Sterling an
nounced today.
It is hoped the 15,000-square-foot
building will be ready for occu
pancy by next spring.
The new building is part of a
| stepped-up program of microwave
| research, which will include study
of the feasibility of building a mul
i ti-billion-volt electron linear accel
| erator.
Stanford already lias a billion
volt electron linear accelerator—
the world's largest—housed in its
present building.
The new building will be located
next door to the present laboratory.
1 When microwave scientists move
' into it, the present building and its
; billion-volt accelerator will be used
; full time for nuclear research.
Use of the big accelerator's lull
power still awaits completion of its
massive end - station, which has
been under construction for more
j than a year. Meantime nuclear sci
! entists are using the apparatus at
lower energies for important ex-
I periments.
A less elaborate terminus for
accelerator electron beams — an
underground radiation vault—will
be built for the new Microwave
Laboratory. Dr. (iin/ton said a
70-million-volt linear accelerator
to serve it is now planned. The
accelerator will be located in a
trench inside the building, with
its electron beam piped into the
subterranean chamber, located a(
an outside corner.
The vault will also be designed
for eventual use in medicine. The

chamber will be split into two cells,
I one for the patient and -the other a
i shielded room for beam operators.
doctors, and nurses. An outside ve
! hide ramp will provide entry.
Dr. Ginzton emphasized that
j medical use of the vault for radia
tion therapy of cancer and other
| diseases is unlikely for several
years. However, a six-million-volt
j medical linear accelerator is being
I built for Stanford School of Medi-
J cine in San Francisco. This is ex
! pected to provide high-energy X
j ray treatment for deep-seated can
! cer by the end of next year/
I)r. Edward L. Gin/ton, labora
tory director, said linear acceler
ator research is now i'joing for
ward under a new contract with
the Atomic Energy Commission.

Other microwave research will
include further development of
klystron tubes. Though these vac
uum tubes were already the world's
most powerful, Stanford scientists
recently doubled their power out
put to 30,000,000 watts. Klystrons
power the linear accelerator and are
key components of radar, television,
and other radio communications.
The laboratory itself will finance
construction of its new building
largely out of funds earned by past
developments'.
The above - ground structure of
the new Microwave Laboratory will
be a single-story, *reinforced-con
erete block building finished to har
monize with existing campus build
ings. It will be L-shaped, with pro
vision for eventual future extension
to a U-shaped structure.


RADIATION VAULT—A subterreanean radiation vault for Stan
ford University's new Microwave Laboratory is designed so
that it can someday be used for medical treatment of cancer
and other diseases. Stanford scientists emphasized, however,
that for the present it will be used only as a radiation-proof "end
station" for microwave research. A 70-million-volt electron lin
ear accelerator, located in a trench within the building, will
"shoot" its beam into the underground chamber.
