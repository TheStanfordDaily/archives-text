## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Norman Manoogian. the captain of
the Cardinal crew, has joined the roll
of Daily Athletes of the Week after
his rousing play in the San Jose tiff
and his year-long performance as
the strong man in the football for
j ward wall.
The massive guard, along with his
â–  running mate Phil Wilson, has been
the bulwark of the publicized pro
tective cup which affords Bobby
Garrett all the time he needs to peg
his on-the-mark passes.
Manoogian has led the Indians'
defensive pursuit continually
through the year and now is the im
! portant figure in the steadily im
| proving gang tackling.
The 5 ft. 10 in., 204 pound Manoog
| ian is the sharpest blocker in the
| front line as well.
It was 'Noogie who threw the tre
mendous key block which sent Ron
Cook on his way 84 yards with Gar
rett's screen pass in the SC game.

Manoogian missed all of last sea
son with a bad knde, but his out
standing blocking and defensive
work with the 1951 Rose Bowl club
and the 1950 Indians made him a
pre-season candidate for Ail-Amer
ican honors.
And he has done nothing to disap
point his fans through nine games.
