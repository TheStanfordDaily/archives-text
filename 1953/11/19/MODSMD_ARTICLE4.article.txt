# Stanford Police on Alert Following Tuesday Raid
## 
### 
Special police have been detailed to keep a night watch on
Stanford Stadium following a visit there by vandals early Tues
day morning.
Raiders poured kerosene in a 20-foot-long "C" on the gridiron
at the north 45-yard line. Apparently they tried igniting the "C,"

but due to the wet conditions they
were unab'e to. On the ground be
side the "C" were two empty kero
sene cans and a used book, of
matches.
The grass in the area has been
partially killed by the kerosene, but
the heavy rains Tuesday morning
helped save the gridiron. The area
may be replaced by special grass.
Following the raid Stanford Po
lice Chief Gordon Davis tailed on
special officers from the Palo
Alto Police Department to keep
watch. Floodlights have been in
stalled to illuminate the Stadium
at night.
It was the fifth raifl by California
students in two weeks. Meanwhile,
the University of California expe
rienced their first raid as an "S" in
red paint appeared yesterday morn
ing in front of Dwindle Hall. The
work was easily eradicated by
workmen that morning. There'were
no indications as to who the raiders
were, though officials did not dis
count the possibility of Berkeley
High vandals.
Raids this year on the Farm
have been at Hoover Tower, Ed
ucation Corner, the Bookstore,
the Museum, and the pillars on
Palm Drive. Freshmen arc guard
ing only the bonfire area this
year.
When asked why the frosh arc
not making their usual all-campus
patrol, Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler replied, "It was the
freshmen's idea. They felt that since
we have signed a non-aggression
pact and intend to live up to it,
California students should be ex
pected to do the same."
