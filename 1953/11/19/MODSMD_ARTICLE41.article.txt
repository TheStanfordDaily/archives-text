# Garrett Halts Quest for National Grid Honors to Answer Youthful Follower
## Fifth Grade Class Thrilled by Letter 
### PHIL BERMAN 
To the fifth grade class and
Patrick Sweeney in particular of
the North Avenue School in Del
Paso Heights, near Sacramento,
Stanford guarterback Bob Gar
rett is the greatest guy in the
world.
Several weeks ago the class em
barked on a letter-writing project
as a part of their social studies pro
gram. The teacher, Mis. George
Farnham, suggested of the
27 pupils &rite a letter to and ask
for a picture of a football celebrity.
Patrick, who is nine and a half,
wrote to Bob Garrett.
Patrick was fortunate because he j
was one of the few members of the ,
class to receive a reply.
One youngster wrote to the Sail
Francisco 49ers and got a price
list of pictures available.
Another wrote to the Los An
geles Rams and is still waiting
for an answer.
Still another wrote to Paul Lar
son, California quarterback. All he
received in return was a picture
which was stamped on the back:
"Copies of the print and other J
pictures of University of California
athletes may be obtained from the j
ASUC news bureau. $1 for 8x 10
prints or $.50 for 5x7 prints."
Garrett's own personal letter to
Patrick said:
''Dear Patrick,
"It was swell hearing from you j
and thanks very much for writ
ing. Here is the picture you asked
for—l hope it is what you wanted. !
"Thanks again for the letter.
"Sincerely,
"(Signed) 808 GARRETT" j
Mrs. Farnham said that Patrick
and the entire class were thrilled
to receive the letter.
She said, "I think this project |
shows the youngsters that the really
big fellow will take the time to j
1 write."
