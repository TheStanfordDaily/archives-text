NEW YORK. Nov. 19 (UP)—Bob
Garrett, Stanford's forward passing
wizard, leads the nation in the race
for the title of college football's
"Mr. Touchdown."
This is a seldom-publicized but
vital championship based on
"touchdown responsibility" — total
of touchdown passes and . touch
downs scored.
Garrett, with one touchdown by
rushing and 16 by passing, is the
nation's leader in current NCAA
statistics but he's getting a terrific
fight from another Pacific Coast
back. Paul Cameron of UCLA.
Cameron, leader most of the sen
son, is second with a total of 1G
touchdowns, 11 by rushing and live
by passing.
