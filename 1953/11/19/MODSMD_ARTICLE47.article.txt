# AIR RO Lists Cadet Scores
## 
### 
First results of the Air Force Of
ficer Qualification Index for Cadets
were published this week, indicat
ing the standings of all AFROTC
Cadets in the Stanford unit.
Top senior Air Force Cadets were

Harrison Schmidt. Besides heading

Arnold Air Society Squadron, an
honorary society.
For the junior class, John Dono
van, John Gregg, and Jerry Gold
berg received the highest ratings.
Donovan is head of the radio divi
sion for the unit's information of
fice, and is in charge of planning
and conducting AFROTC broadcasts
over KZSU and commercial sta
tions.
Outstanding sophomore cadets are
Steve Thomas, Franklin Burns, and
Nathan Leanse. Thomas commands
the Air Force drill team, and is also
a member of the unit's rifle team;,
Frank Burns serves as editor of
the Cadet monthly newsletter, The
Rocket.
The Index, called the OQIC, is a
method of determining each stu
dent's rating in the ROTC unit. It
was developed here at Stanford
during the past year.
The OQIC scores each cadet's
performances in drill, academics, and
military courtesy, among other
things, on an absolute scale. The
scores provide a basis for making
selections for advanced ROTC, giv
ing awards, and assigning promo
tions.
This is the first year that the
OQIC has been used, and Major Roy
M. FJitt, unit evaluation officer, in
dicated that if the results are satis
factory, it will be submitted for
use by all Air Force ROTC units
throughout the country. He ex
plained that the OQIC scores are
not used to compute the University
grade, nor are they dependent on
academic standing to any extent.


" 'YES' to both your questionsâ€”this IS a required course and
there IS a way out of it."
