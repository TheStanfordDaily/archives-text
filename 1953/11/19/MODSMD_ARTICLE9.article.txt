# Cal Students Admit It— Titer Didn't Find the Axe
## Wrong Axe 
### BOB REZAK Associate Editor, The Daily 
BERKELEY, Nov. 18 — Four
spirited University of California
students sheepishly admitted to
day that the Stanford Axe which
turned up mysteriously here
Monday night is not the same
Axe that was stolen from UC's
Stephens Union June 9.
They revealed that the Axe, which
was found in Faculty Glade, a short
distance from the Associated Student
office, was a reproduction of the
original blade and a clever one at
that.
The bogus specimen was made
by the father of Eve Gard, UC co
ed, who is a proprietor of an Oak
hind machine shop. It bore the
stamped inscription: "Made in
U.S. E. Gard. '53."
The shiny new blade, which had
a fresh coat of thinly spread red
paint on its and a bright
new handle, was carefully made to
specifications by comparing it with
photographs of the authentic Axe,
Miss Gard told UC student authori
ties.
A UC janitor named '"Eli," erst
while custodian of the original Axe
since it was first exchanged between
Stanford and UC April 13, 1899 as
a symbol of rivalry between the two
schools, also branded the phony Axe j
as false. The blade did not have the
familiar eroded pits in its surface as
the original relic.
Miss Gard explained that she
and three other students—identi
fied as Ted McKin/.e, Paul Frakes,
and Frank Cabral — devised the
plan in an attempt to "smoke out"
the real Axe. She reported that
the plan was that the phony Axe
would be uncovered at the Big
Game in hopes that whoever has
the authentic trophy would pro
duce it at that time.
The plan backfired when Tom
Merigan, 19-year-old pre-medical
student and head of the Oski com- j
mittec, picked up his phone in Free
born Hall Monday night and heard
a male voice at the other end of the
line tell him that he was interested
in seeing the Axe returned "where
it belongs."
The caller instructed Merigan to
go to the Faculty Glade where some
one would tell him something about
the Axe. Merigan found no one there
when he arrived at the scene, but
he did find the Axe beside a big oak
tree next to Strawberry Creek.
Nobody here seems to know how
the false Axe happened to get
mounted to the 'mahogany plaque
from which the real Axe was un
screwed in June. The board was
supposedly being kept in an ASUC
office.
The Daily Californian published
the story of the return of the Axe
under a banner headline reading
"Stanford Axe Comes Home!" It
wasn't until later today that the
newspaper learned about the fraud.
Ralph Vcttcrlcin, UC student
body president, and John Kirbcy
iVlilicr, head of the UC Axe-finding
committee, revealed later today
; they were aware of the plan to
; manufacture a counterfeit Axe.
Miller said he gave the go ahead
signal because the students were
"acting in good faith." Vetterlein
' estimated that cost of producing the
> imitation Axe was from $300 to $400.
1 He added that he thinks whoever has
' the real trophy "won't keep it for
eternity."
But, he said glumly, if the original
one docs not turn up in time for
presentation to the winner of Sat
urday's annual Big Game, the empty
plaque on which the Axe was
mounted will have to be used. The
phony blade, meanwhile, will be kept
- in a vault in the ASUC office as evi
) dcnce when the real McCoy turns
) up. Then the phony copy will be dc
y stroyed, he declared
Nonetheless, Vetterlein and Mil
1 Icr continued to hold "high hopes"
1 that the authentic Anc will show
up at cither Thursday night's Stan
i ford bonfire rally or UC's bonfire
rally in the Greek Theater Friday
night.
Realization that the Axe found
Monday night was not the real one
touched off widespread speculation
here again today. Miller said the
latest they heard was that the Axe
is in the custody of a Stanford fra
ternity house and that Stanford au
thorities have been asked to make
an investigation.
(Stanford Dean of Students H.

Donald Winbiglcr, Chief Counselor
for Men Robert Huff, Interfraternity
president Gene Dils, and ASSU
President Don Lozabnick said, how
ever, they received no such request.
(Dils made a routine investiga
tion of several Stanford fraterni
ties several weeks ago and found
no trace of the Axe.
(Walt Parks, rally committee
chairman at Stanford, announced he
received a telegram this afternoon
from Bob Collins, UC rally com
mittee head. The wire read, in part:
"See you 7 a.m. Saturday with Axe
in hand."
Collins, when questioned tonight,
said he was really referring to the
phony Axe found in the Glade. "As
far as I know,"he said, "it's the
only Axe. the real Axe.")
As if the disappearance of the
Axe isn't enough, Vcttcrlcin —
baggy-eyed, weary, and worn—de
clared he was not so sure the A\e
stolen June !) is the one originally
forged in 1S!MI.
He said he heard that the first
Axe disappeared sometime around
1027 and has never been recovered.
Past records show that Cal was in
custody of the Axe that year.
If this is true it means that a phony
Axe has been presented to the win
ner of the Big Game since about
1927.

by the father of Eve Gard, UC co
ed, who is a proprietor of an Oak
hind machine shop. It bore the
stamped inscription: "Made in
U.S. E. Gard. '53."
The shiny new blade, which had
a fresh coat of thinly spread red

Stanford and UC April 13, 1899 as

familiar eroded pits in its surface as
the original relic.
Miss Gard explained that she
and three other students—identi
fied as Ted McKin/.e, Paul Frakes,
and Frank Cabral — devised the
plan in an attempt to "smoke out"
the real Axe. She reported that
the plan was that the phony Axe
would be uncovered at the Big
Game in hopes that whoever has
the authentic trophy would pro
duce it at that time.
The plan backfired when Tom
Merigan, 19-year-old pre-medical
student and head of the Oski com- j
mittec, picked up his phone in Free
born Hall Monday night and heard
a male voice at the other end of the
line tell him that he was interested
in seeing the Axe returned "where
it belongs."
The caller instructed Merigan to
go to the Faculty Glade where some
one would tell him something about
the Axe. Merigan found no one there
when he arrived at the scene, but
he did find the Axe beside a big oak
tree next to Strawberry Creek.
Nobody here seems to know how
the false Axe happened to get
mounted to the 'mahogany plaque
from which the real Axe was un
screwed in June. The board was
supposedly being kept in an ASUC
office.

the story of the return of the Axe

the authentic trophy would pro
duce it at that time.
The plan backfired when Tom
Merigan, 19-year-old pre-medical
student and head of the Oski com- j
mittec, picked up his phone in Free
born Hall Monday night and heard
a male voice at the other end of the
line tell him that he was interested
in seeing the Axe returned "where
it belongs."
The caller instructed Merigan to
go to the Faculty Glade where some
one would tell him something about
the Axe. Merigan found no one there
when he arrived at the scene, but
he did find the Axe beside a big oak
tree next to Strawberry Creek.
Nobody here seems to know how
the false Axe happened to get
mounted to the 'mahogany plaque
from which the real Axe was un
screwed in June. The board was
supposedly being kept in an ASUC
office.
The Daily Californian published
the story of the return of the Axe
under a banner headline reading
"Stanford Axe Comes Home!" It
wasn't until later today that the
newspaper learned about the fraud.
Ralph Vcttcrlcin, UC student
body president, and John Kirbcy
iVlilicr, head of the UC Axe-finding
committee, revealed later today
; they were aware of the plan to
; manufacture a counterfeit Axe.
Miller said he gave the go ahead
signal because the students were
"acting in good faith." Vetterlein
' estimated that cost of producing the
> imitation Axe was from $300 to $400.
1 He added that he thinks whoever has
' the real trophy "won't keep it for
eternity."
But, he said glumly, if the original
one docs not turn up in time for
presentation to the winner of Sat
urday's annual Big Game, the empty
plaque on which the Axe was
mounted will have to be used. The
phony blade, meanwhile, will be kept
- in a vault in the ASUC office as evi
) dcnce when the real McCoy turns
) up. Then the phony copy will be dc
y stroyed, he declared
Nonetheless, Vetterlein and Mil
1 Icr continued to hold "high hopes"
1 that the authentic Anc will show
up at cither Thursday night's Stan
i ford bonfire rally or UC's bonfire
rally in the Greek Theater Friday
night.
Realization that the Axe found
Monday night was not the real one
touched off widespread speculation
here again today. Miller said the
latest they heard was that the Axe
is in the custody of a Stanford fra
ternity house and that Stanford au
thorities have been asked to make
an investigation.
(Stanford Dean of Students H.

Donald Winbiglcr, Chief Counselor
for Men Robert Huff, Interfraternity
president Gene Dils, and ASSU
President Don Lozabnick said, how
ever, they received no such request.
(Dils made a routine investiga
tion of several Stanford fraterni
ties several weeks ago and found
no trace of the Axe.
(Walt Parks, rally committee
chairman at Stanford, announced he
received a telegram this afternoon
from Bob Collins, UC rally com
mittee head. The wire read, in part:
"See you 7 a.m. Saturday with Axe
in hand."
Collins, when questioned tonight,
said he was really referring to the
phony Axe found in the Glade. "As
far as I know,"he said, "it's the
only Axe. the real Axe.")
As if the disappearance of the
Axe isn't enough, Vcttcrlcin —
baggy-eyed, weary, and worn—de
clared he was not so sure the A\e
stolen June !) is the one originally
forged in 1S!MI.
He said he heard that the first
Axe disappeared sometime around
1027 and has never been recovered.
Past records show that Cal was in
custody of the Axe that year.
If this is true it means that a phony
Axe has been presented to the win
ner of the Big Game since about
1927.


BOGUS BLADE—This near-perfect replica of the Stanford A.xe, traditional symbol of Big Game
rivalry, was found Monday night under a tree in Faculty Glade on the UC campus. The fake
was believed for awhile to be the actual blade, causing The Daily Californian yesterday to
herald, "Stanford Axe Comes Home!" —Photo courtesy of the Oakland Tribune

the Axe was a fraud. —Daily photo by Don Cheu
