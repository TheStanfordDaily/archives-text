# TRIBE PRIMED FOR BIG ONE
## Cards in Quest of the Axe and the Roses 
### PETE GROTHE Sports Editor, The Daily 
A football team that Chuck Taylor calls "the most amazinc
bunch oi kids I've ever coached" is geared right now to pui
an end to the California Big Game win streak and to add the
climax on what could be the greatest rags-to-riches season iri
Stanford football history.
Ninety thousand posteriors are expected to be sitting in Stan
ford Stadium for the 1:30 p.m. kick-off, a half hour earlier than
usual. Stanford's undefeated Braves will take on* the Cal namblei
at 10:30 a.m.
The Rose Bowl is in the offing, but that really doesn't make
too much difference to the sophomores, juniors, and nine senior
who will race out on the field in red pants and white jerseys to
morrow.
There's only one game they care about and that s the Big Game.
As one player said, "I'd rather win the Big Game than a hundred
Rose Bowls."
Stanford, the same team that got oft the worst performance
ever put together by organized human beings against COP
(25 to 20) is a seven point favorite tomorrow. Its a seven point
favorite because a spirited team found itself and started trounc
ing teams the "experts" said it had no right beating.
Stanford is a seven point favorite because it has All-American
Bob Garrett and John Steinberg, Sam Morley, and Ron Cook —the
best passing combination in the United States.
Tt is a seven point favorite because it includes in its enrollment
Captain Norm Manoogian, scrappy Phil Wilson, and rugged Ted
[ Tanner, one of the best line middles in college football.

And it is a seven point favorite because never has it been
so physically ready or so menially ready. The latter factor is
particularly important. Make no mistake about it, the Stanford
Spirit, so abundantly evident in practice this last week, will
be represented on the scoreboard when dusk falls tomorrow
night.
Coach Pappy Waldorf's aggregation will be formidably strong
tomorrow as it is in every Big Game. Spearheading the Bears
.s Turlock's Paul Larson, who is rewriting the record book at
Berkeley. He is as colorful as he is unorthodox—and always
dangerous. He is equally adept at running and passing. If Chuck
Taylor's men can stop Larson, they can beat Cal. The formula is
as simple as that, although stopping Larson isn't.

As subsidiary threats, Cal has halfbacks Don Marks and A 1
Talley, both excellent running threats. However, for the first time
in quite a few years the Bears don't have anyone whom they can
classify as a top grade power back.
Waldorf has a line which is strong at offensive blocking but
which is nothing more than average on defense. Tackle Dick
Day, half Johnny Wilson, and guard Tevis Martin are injured,
but Day will start anyway.
The Bears have been very hot and cold this year. They rocked
Penn, 40 to 0, and Washington, 53 to 25, but have looked sporadic
in losing to USC and tieing Oregon.
But the 90,000 can expect the Blue and Gold to be at its best to
morrow. And they can also expect Stanford to be at its best. The
Indians have shown in practice this last week that they are razor
sharp.
Tomorrow will be the last appearance in Stanford Stadium for
nine Stanford seniors. It'll he the last lime for blond Bobby
Garrett, who leads the nation in every passing statistic, and is
second in total offense, although he has lost over 100 yards
rushing. Taylor has called Garrett, whose secret of success is
the soft, accurate pass, the best passer in Stanford history.
Number 17 won't look right on anyone else.
It's also the last appearance for the great team leader Manoog
ian, and for Phil Wilson, whom a coach described as the most
underrated player in America. And Tanner, Cook, rock-ribbed
Marsh Howe, Barry Smith. And Morley and Steinberg, next to
Bill McColl, Stanford's finest receivers.
It's their last appearance, and they're tired of losing to Cal.
They're not planning to wait until next year.

usual. Stanford's undefeated Braves will take on* the Cal namblei
at 10:30 a.m.
The Rose Bowl is in the offing, but that really doesn't make
too much difference to the sophomores, juniors, and nine senior
who will race out on the field in red pants and white jerseys to
morrow.
There's only one game they care about and that s the Big Game.
As one player said, "I'd rather win the Big Game than a hundred
Rose Bowls."
Stanford, the same team that got oft the worst performance
ever put together by organized human beings against COP
(25 to 20) is a seven point favorite tomorrow. Its a seven point
favorite because a spirited team found itself and started trounc
ing teams the "experts" said it had no right beating.
Stanford is a seven point favorite because it has All-American
Bob Garrett and John Steinberg, Sam Morley, and Ron Cook —the
best passing combination in the United States.
Tt is a seven point favorite because it includes in its enrollment
Captain Norm Manoogian, scrappy Phil Wilson, and rugged Ted
[ Tanner, one of the best line middles in college football.

And it is a seven point favorite because never has it been
so physically ready or so menially ready. The latter factor is
particularly important. Make no mistake about it, the Stanford
Spirit, so abundantly evident in practice this last week, will
be represented on the scoreboard when dusk falls tomorrow
night.
Coach Pappy Waldorf's aggregation will be formidably strong
tomorrow as it is in every Big Game. Spearheading the Bears
.s Turlock's Paul Larson, who is rewriting the record book at
Berkeley. He is as colorful as he is unorthodox—and always
dangerous. He is equally adept at running and passing. If Chuck
Taylor's men can stop Larson, they can beat Cal. The formula is
as simple as that, although stopping Larson isn't.

As subsidiary threats, Cal has halfbacks Don Marks and A 1
Talley, both excellent running threats. However, for the first time
in quite a few years the Bears don't have anyone whom they can
classify as a top grade power back.
Waldorf has a line which is strong at offensive blocking but
which is nothing more than average on defense. Tackle Dick
Day, half Johnny Wilson, and guard Tevis Martin are injured,
but Day will start anyway.
The Bears have been very hot and cold this year. They rocked
Penn, 40 to 0, and Washington, 53 to 25, but have looked sporadic
in losing to USC and tieing Oregon.
But the 90,000 can expect the Blue and Gold to be at its best to
morrow. And they can also expect Stanford to be at its best. The
Indians have shown in practice this last week that they are razor
sharp.
Tomorrow will be the last appearance in Stanford Stadium for
nine Stanford seniors. It'll he the last lime for blond Bobby
Garrett, who leads the nation in every passing statistic, and is
second in total offense, although he has lost over 100 yards
rushing. Taylor has called Garrett, whose secret of success is
the soft, accurate pass, the best passer in Stanford history.
Number 17 won't look right on anyone else.
It's also the last appearance for the great team leader Manoog
ian, and for Phil Wilson, whom a coach described as the most
underrated player in America. And Tanner, Cook, rock-ribbed
Marsh Howe, Barry Smith. And Morley and Steinberg, next to
Bill McColl, Stanford's finest receivers.
It's their last appearance, and they're tired of losing to Cal.
They're not planning to wait until next year.

A football team that Chuck Taylor calls "the most amazinc
bunch oi kids I've ever coached" is geared right now to pui
an end to the California Big Game win streak and to add the
climax on what could be the greatest rags-to-riches season iri
Stanford football history.
Ninety thousand posteriors are expected to be sitting in Stan
ford Stadium for the 1:30 p.m. kick-off, a half hour earlier than
usual. Stanford's undefeated Braves will take on* the Cal namblei
