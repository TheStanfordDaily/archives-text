fornia campuses continued to buzz
with speculation again yesterday
on the whereabouts of the missing
Stanford Axe.
At Stanlord the only official com
ment from student leaders was that
there is still no evidence to indicate
the Big Game trophy is here.
At Cal, however, all clues led
to the Farm. Ralph Vetterlein,
UC student body president, api
pearcd to be noncommittal, but he
said he's "pretty sure" the Axe
is at Stanford.
He said he had "no proof' but all
clues Cal has had of late make it
appear as though the Indians have
it.
The Big Game trophy failed to
show up at last night's Stanford
bonfire rally as anticipated and
Stanfordites figure it might possibly
turn up at UC's Greek Theater bon
fire rally tonight.
If the blade, stolen from UC
June !i, fails to be recovered in
tiine for tomorrow's clash, the
empty plaque on which the Axe
was mounted will be presented to
the winner of the annual classic,
according to Vetterlein.
A phony axe was found on the !
UC campus late Tuesday night. I
Four UC students admitted they '
manufactured the blade in an at
tempted plan to "smoke out" the
authentic trophy.
