## 
### 
The name of a former Stan
ford student now at the Univer
sity of California was implicated
in Wednesday night's plot to
.ime-bomb the Eig Game bon
fire pyre in Lake Lagunita. and
was turned over yesterday to
Jal authorities by Dean of Stu
dents H. Donald Winbigler.
Campus police learned the stu- j
dent's name alter quizzing several
Stantord si.udent.-i wno seemed to
have prior knowledge of the at
tempt to sabotage the towering
.-.tack.
Police believe it is likely that
other ttudents are involved.
The sabotage try was foiled I
when a Stanford student, report- j
edly an upperclassinan, alerted
students heading the bonfire work |
to be on the lookout for a bomb, j
lie has been quoted as explaining
that he is l.om iieike«ey and was j
approached by several of his j
home-town friends attending UC
to go along with the plan and
help out.
He is said to have given his okay |
so that he could be on the watch [
for the bomb and tip oil Stanford j
officials before it was'planted.
The Stanford dean said he will
leave the job of questioning the one j
. u pect and bringing charges to Cal j
officials. »
The bomb — which was hidden I
neatly in a hollowed - out log and
which was made oi thermite, an in
gredient of incendiary bombs — was
de cribed as "potentially dangerous" !
by campus police
"I hate to think of what would ;
have happened if the bomb had ex- 1
ploded and started the bonfire
burning with students standing j
around or working on it," Chief of
Police Gordon Davis said.
Dean Winbigler, when talking will: j
The Daily about the incident yester- I
day, said an explosion of the bomb j
"might have resulted in loss of life
as well as serious injury."
The bomb was disarmed by cam
pus Police Sergeant Ben Hlckey and
Major Forrest K. Spiva, a demolition
expert from the Presidio in San
Francisco, possibly minutes before |
the timing mechanism was expected
to fire and touch off the thermite.
Sergeant Hickey told The Daily
that he was tipped off by an un
known Stanford student at about
12:45 a.m. that the bomb was due
to discharge sometime between 1
and 1:30 a.m.
He set to work immediately to
disengage the deadly ticking clock j
within the bomb.
Major Spiva, who had been sum
moned about an hour before, ar
rived to complete the deactivation
of the bomb.
The bomb was made up of a
cleverly contrived timing device,
sacks of thermite, and two cans '
of gasoline.
The log in which the bomb was
hidden was found around 10 p.m.
by students who had been alerted
by the Stanfordite. '
The log itself was spotted when
two students were observed lifting
it gingerly from a trailer in which
a large load of wood had been !
dumped.
The two students drove away in j
an old model car before they could
be questioned.
The bomb, when found, was j
carried to a point about 100 yards
distant from where the bonfire j
construction work was being
done, and a call was sent to the
Stanford police and fire depart
ments.
Stanford firemen split the log and
exposed the lethal mechanism.

In discussing the incident, the
second attempt purportedly made
by UC students on the bonfire, Dean
Winbigler said, "1 am sure that the
incident will not be taken lightly
by University of California authori
ties. We have reported to Berkeley
the name of a former Stanford stu
dent who transferred to Cal and
who is alleged to have made ar

rangements here for the plot.
"The students who arc in
charge of the bonfire are to be
commended f<A their alertness in
seeing that the homh was iso
lated.'"
A special investigator from tin-
Santa Clara County District Attor
neys' office is expected to inspect
the bomb sometime today.

The name of a former Stan

in Wednesday night's plot to
.ime-bomb the Eig Game bon
fire pyre in Lake Lagunita. and
was turned over yesterday to
Jal authorities by Dean of Stu

Campus police learned the stu- j
dent's name alter quizzing several
Stantord si.udent.-i wno seemed to

other ttudents are involved.
The sabotage try was foiled I

students heading the bonfire work |
to be on the lookout for a bomb, j
lie has been quoted as explaining
that he is l.om iieike«ey and was j
approached by several of his j
home-town friends attending UC
to go along with the plan and

The bomb — which was hidden I
neatly in a hollowed - out log and
which was made oi thermite, an in

by campus police
"I hate to think of what would ;

ploded and started the bonfire
burning with students standing j

Police Gordon Davis said.
Dean Winbigler, when talking will: j
The Daily about the incident yester- I
day, said an explosion of the bomb j
"might have resulted in loss of life
as well as serious injury."
The bomb was disarmed by cam
pus Police Sergeant Ben Hlckey and
Major Forrest K. Spiva, a demolition
expert from the Presidio in San
Francisco, possibly minutes before |
the timing mechanism was expected
to fire and touch off the thermite.
Sergeant Hickey told The Daily
that he was tipped off by an un
known Stanford student at about
12:45 a.m. that the bomb was due
to discharge sometime between 1
and 1:30 a.m.
He set to work immediately to
disengage the deadly ticking clock j
within the bomb.
Major Spiva, who had been sum
moned about an hour before, ar
rived to complete the deactivation
of the bomb.
The bomb was made up of a
cleverly contrived timing device,
sacks of thermite, and two cans '
of gasoline.
The log in which the bomb was
hidden was found around 10 p.m.
by students who had been alerted
by the Stanfordite. '
The log itself was spotted when
two students were observed lifting
it gingerly from a trailer in which
a large load of wood had been !
dumped.

Francisco, possibly minutes before |
the timing mechanism was expected
to fire and touch off the thermite.
Sergeant Hickey told The Daily
that he was tipped off by an un
known Stanford student at about
12:45 a.m. that the bomb was due
to discharge sometime between 1
and 1:30 a.m.
He set to work immediately to
disengage the deadly ticking clock j
within the bomb.
Major Spiva, who had been sum
moned about an hour before, ar
rived to complete the deactivation
of the bomb.
The bomb was made up of a
cleverly contrived timing device,
sacks of thermite, and two cans '
of gasoline.
The log in which the bomb was
hidden was found around 10 p.m.
by students who had been alerted
by the Stanfordite. '
The log itself was spotted when
two students were observed lifting
it gingerly from a trailer in which
a large load of wood had been !
dumped.
The two students drove away in j
an old model car before they could
be questioned.
The bomb, when found, was j
carried to a point about 100 yards
distant from where the bonfire j
construction work was being
done, and a call was sent to the
Stanford police and fire depart
ments.
Stanford firemen split the log and
exposed the lethal mechanism.

In discussing the incident, the
second attempt purportedly made
by UC students on the bonfire, Dean
Winbigler said, "1 am sure that the
incident will not be taken lightly
by University of California authori
ties. We have reported to Berkeley
the name of a former Stanford stu
dent who transferred to Cal and
who is alleged to have made ar

rangements here for the plot.
"The students who arc in
charge of the bonfire are to be
commended f<A their alertness in
seeing that the homh was iso
lated.'"
A special investigator from tin-
Santa Clara County District Attor
neys' office is expected to inspect
the bomb sometime today.
