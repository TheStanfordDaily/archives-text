Revenge will provide an in
centive for the Stanford soccer
team when they meet California
on Saturday at 10 a.m. on the
Stanford soccer field.
All week long Weinstein has
driven his men particularly hard,
and there is no doubt that they are
physically and mentally ready. If
only the line can produce a few
more of those necessary goals.

The Card line is anchored by co
captain and left inside Sam Suarez.
Sam has performed brilliantly all
season long and is a sure choice for
all league honors.
Complementing Sam and rounding
out the rest of a potentially brilliant
forward wall are Dick Koenigsberger
at right wing. Chuck Andrews, right
inside, Fred Tucrk, center forward,
and the flying Scandinavian, Niels
Vinding at left wing.
The Stanford defense, which has

performed brilliantly all season long,
is led by Derek Liecty, the other co
captain, who plays center half.
Playing next to Liecty at the other
halfback posts are Peter Mack, a
freshman, and Sam Register, a three"
year veteran.
Finally, the trio which defends the
Card goal is goalie Ken Woods and
fullbacks John Manna and John Sen
otus. They have given Stanford the
best inner protection in the con
ference.
