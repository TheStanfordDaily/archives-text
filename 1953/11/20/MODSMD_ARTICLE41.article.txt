U.S Commissioner Joseph Karesh
released him on his own recogniz
ance yesterday after he had been
arrested on campus at noon by two-
FBI men. Ilis draft law violation
case has been set for Dec. 3.
Dean of Students 11. Donald
Winbiglcr said yesterday, "As far I
as can he determined, the difii- !
culty is based on misunderstand
ing. AI did not receive his indue- '
tion notice and was in no sense
trying to evade the draft. For, '
when lie lieavd through unonieial
sources ol his situation, he sub
-111 iHod himself for voluntary in
duction at the Santa Clara County
board.
"lie was told tl;;it lie could lie
inducted only by his own board
in Honolulu, and he should write
to them. This he did, but it proved 1

to he late, for the matter had al
ready been turned over to the
U.S. Attorney General in San
Francisco "
A warrant lor Napoleon's arrest
was issued in Honolulu yesterday
by U.S. Attorney A. William Bar
low, who said that he would not
prosecute if Napoleon submitted
himself for induction.
Napoleon, when asked at yes
terday's hearing if he would sub
mit himself for induction, said, "I
certainly will."
Acting Chief Counselor of Men
Robert HnlT said yesterday,"I
think that this whole situation has
been blown way out of propor
tion. The Honolulu draft board
has always known where they
could contact Napoleon. I have
written three letters to them."
When Napoleon returned from
the hearing yesterday to practice,
he was greeted by a cheer from his
teammates.
