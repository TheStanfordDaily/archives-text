# Bear-Indian Statistics Tell Confused Tale
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
You look at comparative sc6res,
you study team statistics, and im
mediately you're confused.
But since the football public
has been dazed all week by a con
glomeration of Big Game theories,
perhaps it won't do any more
harm to run through this statisti
cal business.
Take these figures as a starter:
1 Cat beat Washington, 53-25;
Stanford barely held on, 13-7.
Therefore the Bears are 22 points
better than the Indians.
•2. Cal had a real fight to finally
pull away from San Jose, 34-14;
Stanford toyed with the Spartans,
54-0. Therefore Stanford is 34 points
better . '
3. Cal fell to UCLA, 20-7; Stan
ford nipped the Bruin, 21-20.
Therefore Stanford is 14 points bet
ter.
4. Cal dumped Oregon State, 26-
0; Stanford shut out OSC, 21-0.
Therefore it should be Cal by 5
points.
Had enough of that? Well,
when scores of the six mutual
foes — SC, UCLA, Washington,
WSC, Oregon, and OSC—are to
taled, Cal has 140 points offen
sively to the Indians' 136. But the
Golden Bear has permitted its
rivals to score 92 points while the
Big Red has given up only 50.
That makes Cal 4 points better
offensively and Stanford the defen
sive master by 42 digits. All in all,
the Indians, after this mathematical
analysis, figure by 38.
How much is this computation
worth? Let's just say it's a thought.
Now to shift thoughts to statistics
on such things as rushing, passing,
receiving, and fumbling on second
down with more than ten yards to
tio.
Because Bob Garrett and Paul
Larson may convert the Big
Game into a paswmd-pass-some
morc duel, the comparative aerial
stats jump into prominence.
Stanford has pitched the pellet
203 times with but eight intercep
tions; California has hurled 173
passes with 17 interceptions. Gar
rett stands at 178 attempts with five
thefts, Larson at 149 with 14 picked
ofT.
That could well be Cal's doom.
Fumbles, however, if you put your
confidence in these numbers, might
ruin the Cards. Stanford has lost

the ball 20 times on its 28 fumbles
while Cal has failed to recover 17
of its 31 bobbles.
A brief look-see at the more gen
erally quoted statistics reveals that
Stanford has gained 1,664 yards

passing and 1,504 rushing for a total
of 3,168. Cal has thrown for 1,443
and run for 1,694 for 3,137 total
yards.
The Bears have made 150 first
downs—B4 running and 62 passing—

j while Stanford has been chalking
up 160—80 running and 76 passing.
Stanford has scored 33 touch
downs over the season, including 18
on passes; Cal has tallied 30 with
just seven coming in the air.

Because Bob Garrett and Paul
Larson may convert the Big
Game into a paswmd-pass-some
morc duel, the comparative aerial
stats jump into prominence.
Stanford has pitched the pellet
203 times with but eight intercep
tions; California has hurled 173
passes with 17 interceptions. Gar
rett stands at 178 attempts with five
thefts, Larson at 149 with 14 picked
ofT.
That could well be Cal's doom.
Fumbles, however, if you put your
confidence in these numbers, might
ruin the Cards. Stanford has lost

the ball 20 times on its 28 fumbles
while Cal has failed to recover 17
of its 31 bobbles.
A brief look-see at the more gen
erally quoted statistics reveals that
Stanford has gained 1,664 yards

passing and 1,504 rushing for a total
of 3,168. Cal has thrown for 1,443
and run for 1,694 for 3,137 total
yards.
The Bears have made 150 first
downs—B4 running and 62 passing—

j while Stanford has been chalking
up 160—80 running and 76 passing.
Stanford has scored 33 touch
downs over the season, including 18
on passes; Cal has tallied 30 with
just seven coming in the air.
You look at comparative sc6res,
you study team statistics, and im
mediately you're confused.
But since the football public
has been dazed all week by a con
glomeration of Big Game theories,
perhaps it won't do any more
harm to run through this statisti
cal business.
Take these figures as a starter:
1 Cat beat Washington, 53-25;
Stanford barely held on, 13-7.
Therefore the Bears are 22 points
better than the Indians.
•2. Cal had a real fight to finally
pull away from San Jose, 34-14;
Stanford toyed with the Spartans,
54-0. Therefore Stanford is 34 points
better . '
3. Cal fell to UCLA, 20-7; Stan
ford nipped the Bruin, 21-20.
Therefore Stanford is 14 points bet
ter.
4. Cal dumped Oregon State, 26-
0; Stanford shut out OSC, 21-0.
Therefore it should be Cal by 5
points.
Had enough of that? Well,
when scores of the six mutual
foes — SC, UCLA, Washington,
WSC, Oregon, and OSC—are to
taled, Cal has 140 points offen
sively to the Indians' 136. But the
Golden Bear has permitted its
rivals to score 92 points while the
Big Red has given up only 50.
That makes Cal 4 points better
offensively and Stanford the defen
sive master by 42 digits. All in all,
the Indians, after this mathematical
analysis, figure by 38.
How much is this computation
worth? Let's just say it's a thought.
Now to shift thoughts to statistics
on such things as rushing, passing,
receiving, and fumbling on second
down with more than ten yards to
tio.
