It's Big Game time again!
And at Cal, as well as at Stan- j
lord, a round of activities have ;
been going on lor the past week
to get students in the proper
Big Game frenzy that sweeps
both campuses every year
about this time.
Our traditional rivals in the in
stitution across the Bay closely par
allel our Big Game Week goings-on,
with a few significant changes.
Cal students started off things
with a bang last Friday with the
choosing of their Big Game Sweet- 1
heai t. The lucky coed, Carol Seiss, |
was chosen Monday in the finals, j
and crowned Tuesday nighl at the j
opening performance of the Axe- j
travagan/.a. j
The Sweetheart went through a j
week of radio and television ap- j
pearances. She also will occupy a I
place ol' importance, together with i
her four attendants, in today's pa- j
rade and rally and tomorrow's game, i

tied was the forbidden eoior at j
Berkeley Monday. "Blue Monday,'
| an old Cal tradition, punished any
| student caught wearing that "hor
rible" color with a trial by the !
! Kangaroo Court.
Kally Com members patrolled the \
campus looking for offenders, and
the trials were carried on in the tra
ditional humorous vein by the judges,
members of the Big "C" Society.
While Stanford boasts the Gaieties,
Cal has its Axe-travaganza. Both
shows started Tuesday and featured
campus talent in a program of skits
and songs.
Stanford's show was a collection j
! of these skits around a general |
\ theme; Cal, departing from the j
practice of the past few seasons, '
| presented a musical comedy en
titled "Talk It Up!" The show was
! a satire of campus life with original
! songs and music.
Stanford students "Licked the j
| Bear" Wednesday, hoping that the l
I game will carry out the theme.
Jazz seems to be king on both
! campuses, as both the Red and White i
! and the Blue and Gold plan con- |
j certs for the crazy cats.
Cal offered students a choice of '

both Dixieland and Progressive jaxz.
George Lewis, the famous musician
currently at the Club Hangover, de
lighted the two-beat fans, and an
all-star group "sent" the cats.
The concerts were presented Tuesday
and Wednesday.
Turk Murphy will play this
afternoon at Rudy's Alpine Inn
for Farm jazz enthusiasts.
Cal will hold its parade and rally
today, This afternoon the parade
will wend its way down the streets
of Berkeley with floats, bands, and
the Big Game Sweetheart providing
the entertainment.
The theme of this year's parade—
"Hoar of the 'C'" will be carried out
in all the floats, with prizes awarded
for the best of the entries.
Tonight loyal Berkeleyites will
gather in the Greek Theater to
whip up school spirit in a bonfire
and rally. Many traditional events
will be featured, including the
reading of the Andy Smith Eulogy,
school yells, and hand selections.
Coach Pappy Waldorf and the Big
Game captains will speak to the
rooters.
And, after the rally and bonfire,

students will follow the California
Bund to the* Big Game Ball to wind
up the evening in a big way.
Tomorrow, of course, activity of
Loth schools will center in Stanford
Stadium at 2 p.m. Before the game
Stanford alumni will be honored at
open houses and a luncheon.
And then Cal, with Oskie, and
Stanford, with Prince Lighlfcot, and,
incidentally, the members of the two
football teams, will renew the tra
ditional rivalry before a screaming,
singing, card-waving audience.
It's Big Game time again!

place in the ticket line the next day.
