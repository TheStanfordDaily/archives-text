# A 						LOT Of PAINT
## 
### 
The big block C on Berkeley's
Charter Hill, target of many paint
raids, was constructed by the classes
of '07 and '08. The hardy roughs
hiked up the hill lugging buckets
full of cement to form the letter.
In 1042 curious students scraped
one corner of the C and discovered
it had been painted 120 times The
first 80 layers were yellow, and after
that it alternated red and yellow.
