# Oskie, Prince Lightfoot Lead Rival Rooting Sections
## Oskie—Only a Few Know His Identity 
### PAT KING 
Oskie once held a baseball scholarship to Stanford.
That was back in 1947 when a young freshman diamond star
spent only one week at Stanford before "cfeciding to transfer to
Cal. As a result, Stanford lost a ballplayer and Cal gained a new
Oskie.
Oskie, for anyone who has never seen him, is Cal's mascot.

Topped off by a huge papier-mache
bear head, the little fellow cavorts
across the football field, shimmies up
and down the j>oal posts, and snatches
unsuspecting queens and carries
them around the track.
This particular Oskie, whom
we'll call "Mr. X" since even now
his name must he kept a secret,
spent five years as Cal's number
one campus personality. And
throughout that time, only a half
dozen people knew his identity.
How was he chosen? "It's almost
a touch system," Mr. X explained.
"I was walking to class one day
when someone came up to me and
asked me if I'd like to be Oskie. I
said 'yes,' and that was it."
The person who tapped Mr. X was
a member of a small, self-perpetu
ating group which scans the student
body for likely prospects. The group
is composed of former Oskies, so
its members are also unknown to
everyone but the Dean of Men.
An Oskie must meet fairly rigid
qualifications, lie must be short,
yet sturdy enough to carry coeds
or band players with equal ease.
He must be clever and quick to
improvise new stunts.
Above all, he must be limber. He
has to climb up a' goal post and
swing from the crossbars while suf
focating underneath 35 pounds o

costume.
"I lost an average of 8 pounds a
game." Mr. X said. "The bear head
is very bulky, and you can't get any
air inside it. Aral the straw malting
inside the rest of the suit makes it !
even hotter."
Didn't anyone ever guess who !
he was? "Some people suspected, I
but they never knew for sure. I j
even used to take a date to the I
game. At half time I'd leave to go
buy a hot dog, quick change and
go out onto the field, and come j
back into the stands at the end
of the half. And my date never
guessed where I'd been."
Life as an Oskie isn't all football
games. Mr. X was in constant de
mand for alumni dinners and Uni
versity-sponsored banquets. "What
I lost during the game I gained back
at dinners during the week," he
laughed.
Thinking up new stunts was Mr.
X's biggest job. and biggest thrill.
There was the time when he sud
denly spotted a "cute blonde" who
was one of the attendants for the
football queen. He had been warned
by the Dean of Men not to pick
up any of the queens, but he just

RIVAL MASCOTS — Cal's Oskie,. left, and Stanford's Prince
Lightfoot, right, wave a greeting to Big Game rooters. Both
Oskie once held a baseball scholarship to Stanford.
That was back in 1947 when a young freshman diamond star
spent only one week at Stanford before "cfeciding to transfer to
Cal. As a result, Stanford lost a ballplayer and Cal gained a new
Oskie.
Oskie, for anyone who has never seen him, is Cal's mascot.

Topped off by a huge papier-mache
bear head, the little fellow cavorts
across the football field, shimmies up
and down the j>oal posts, and snatches
unsuspecting queens and carries
them around the track.
This particular Oskie, whom
we'll call "Mr. X" since even now
his name must he kept a secret,
spent five years as Cal's number
one campus personality. And
throughout that time, only a half
dozen people knew his identity.
How was he chosen? "It's almost
a touch system," Mr. X explained.
"I was walking to class one day
when someone came up to me and
asked me if I'd like to be Oskie. I
said 'yes,' and that was it."
The person who tapped Mr. X was
a member of a small, self-perpetu
ating group which scans the student
body for likely prospects. The group
is composed of former Oskies, so
its members are also unknown to
everyone but the Dean of Men.
An Oskie must meet fairly rigid
qualifications, lie must be short,
yet sturdy enough to carry coeds
or band players with equal ease.
He must be clever and quick to
improvise new stunts.
Above all, he must be limber. He
has to climb up a' goal post and
swing from the crossbars while suf
focating underneath 35 pounds o

costume.
"I lost an average of 8 pounds a
game." Mr. X said. "The bear head
is very bulky, and you can't get any
air inside it. Aral the straw malting
inside the rest of the suit makes it !
even hotter."
Didn't anyone ever guess who !
he was? "Some people suspected, I
but they never knew for sure. I j
even used to take a date to the I
game. At half time I'd leave to go
buy a hot dog, quick change and
go out onto the field, and come j
back into the stands at the end
of the half. And my date never
guessed where I'd been."
Life as an Oskie isn't all football
games. Mr. X was in constant de
mand for alumni dinners and Uni
versity-sponsored banquets. "What
I lost during the game I gained back
at dinners during the week," he
laughed.
