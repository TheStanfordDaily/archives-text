# Prince Lightfoot Dances for Victory
## 
### TACY SMITH 
On Saturday afternoons he's Prince Lightfoot, the Stanford mas- ,
cot.
Monday through Friday, he's Timm Williams, who works at
Mission Terminals Company in San Francisco.
On Friday afternoons during football season, Williams leaves |

his city life and arrives at Stanford*
to be on hand as official mascot for j
the weekend football activities.
Prince Liglitfoot has performed
at Stanford rallies and games since
the Big Game rally in 1!)51. His
only payment is "the enjoyment 1
get from taking part in the Stan
ford games."

Before each game, ancl during the j
{ half-time, the Indian mascot per
j forms symbolic dances in full re
galia, complete from feather head
dress to moccasins.
His ceremony before the game is j
! a benediction. The dances are for
| speed, strength, endurance and ul
| timate victory for the Stanford team.
Prince Lightfoot is a full-blooded j
Yurok Indian. The tribe has about '
1,000 members who live in the j
Klamath area of northern Califor- I
nia. Lightfoot is still active in the |
tribal activities, and he attends J
ceremonials during the year "to
learn to sing and dance better."
His interest in Stanford came as
I a result of his admiration for the
spirit of sportsmanship and friend
ship of the students. Before the Big
| Game rally in 1951, Prince Light
foot was asked by friends' at Stan
j ford to offer his services as the team's
! mascot. He performed at the rally
and has been the official mascot ever
since.

All was well until half time |
ended, and Mr. X walked oIT the |
fieldâ€”and into the arms of the
Dean of Men. For a few minutes j
he thought he was going to he ex
pelled, hut he was let oil with a
sharp reprimand.
After that incident, all Oskie j
stunts were cataloged in the ASUC j
office so there could be no excuse for
any further "mistakes."
At the end of five years Mr. X was
ready to retire. "I'd been up and
down that darn goal post at least
124 times, and that was enough for
me."
