# 'OH ENCINIA, QUADRANGULA...'
## First Stanford Songs Sung in Latin 
### EDA MENDELS 
They express Stanford spirit
and make noise.
That's about the only true gen
eralization about the Stanford
songs and yells, in their evolu
tion from the '90's to today.
I
Men of the '90's waxed eloquent
j about Stafford with a Latinization
i of familiar names in a football song
j chorus:
Encinia, Quadrangula.
Palo Alto, Ruble Hall.
Encinia, Quadrangula,
Still waves the Cardinal.
One wonders what taunts were
; shouted across the field, for the 1H97
book of Stanford songs and yells lists
the following:
(Answer lo Raw, Raw, Raw)
Cooked, cooked, cooked,
Cooked, cooked, cooked,
U. C. Berkeley,
Cooked, cooked, cooked,
In the early days many of the foot
ball songs were Stanford words to
I popular tunes such as "Marching
i Through Georgia" and "John
i Brown's Body." Several of these
songs described the playing and
: scoring of the team, with yearly re
| vision to include the names of cur
rent gridiron heroes.

Contests for new Stanford songs
were held annually in the early tlays.
The 1900 prize winner, for example,
w;:u "Shirts Aflame," sung to the
tune of "Dixie":
See those fellows in shirts aflame
Who play like hell and win the
Rame
Shout again, Shout again,
Shout again, Stanford men.
Many of the contest winners held
popularity for a few years and then
were sung no more. The 1909 selec
tion, however, has endured very
well. That is "Sons of the Stanford
Red," composed by Wm. G. Achi, '12,
with words of G. F. Morgan, '10.
The compilers of the 1923 volume
of Stanford songs credited the stu
dent body with a good musical back
ground. They listed the songs with
the starting note, such as "Hail,
Alma Mater," (Key of G, starting
note E), and "Come, Join the Band,"
(Key ol C, starting note G).
"Come, Join the Band" is perhaps
one of the best known Stanford
marching songs. One alumnus re
ported that it was played at Yoko
hama on VJ-day by an Army band
a;: a Navy transport unloaded.
The most recent addition to the
song collection is "Roll, You Big
Red Machine." Wally White com
posed it as the finale for the 1950
Gaieties, where it proved so popu

lar that it was used as another of
the football songs.
The Stanford Hymn was first sung
in f902. 'It was written in 189.'! by a
faculty couple, Prof. Albert Smith
of the mechunical engineering de
partment and Prof. Mary Roberts
Smith of the English department.
The Mormon Choir 112 rom the
Tabernacle at Salt Lake City really
introduced "Hail, Stanford, Hail" to
the student body. This choir sang the
hymn a.s one of the numbers of the
Â»

conceit it w;is giving here.
The Stanford audience was de
lighted with the hymn and learned
it for the next intercollegiate con
tent. That was a baseball game with
Cal, and at the* conclusion the root
ing section rose, uncovered their
heads, and sang all three stanzas.
That action became a tradition.
While other customs came anil went,
the standing and singing of thf
Stanford Hymn at the conclusion *of
a game became a cherished ritual.
