# Stanford Axe History: Series of Daring Raids
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
For the last six years Stanford
has tried unsuccessfully to
wrest possession of the Axe
from California by defeating the
Bears in the Big Game.
Now, with the Card chances of
winning best since their last victory
in 194(5, the traditional Stanford Axe
is no longer at stake. Or at least I
it isn't until someone tells who has j
it now.
An imitation of the real trophy
appeared at Berkeley Tuesday
night, but so far the genuine Axe
has not reappeared.
The Stanford Axe traditionally
has gone to the winning school to
keep for a year. The Axe also
has a tradition of being missing
for extended periods of time. The
latest theft of the trophy occurred
during finals week last spring.
At that time it was situated in a
basement trophy case at Berkeley.
A glass was broken and the Axe re
moved. A five-dollar bill, appar
ently to pay for the damaged glass,
was left in its place.
Though the Axe was "born" in
1899, it has spent a good part of
the time since with its whereabouts
unknown. Even the history of the
Axe is a spotty one.
The Axe originally looked quite
different than it docs today. It
was fashioned by yell leader Billy

Krh from a rusty 111-pound broad- j
axe with a 15-inch blade and a ,
15 - inch handle. After several j
hand-to-hand battles to gain pos
session of the Axe, the handle
was cut ofT to make it a mere tro- !
phy instead of a lethal weapon.
Many people believe the Axe Yell
was made in reference to the Stan
ford Axe. Actually, the yell came
first, and Erb originated the trophy
to symbolize the yell and bolster
the spirits of the 1899 baseball team.
The only thing the Axe has
ever actually cut was a papier
mache bear, which it beheaded at
the game. Stanford lost the con
test and some jubilant Bear root
ers decided to capture the Axe.
After a street fight in San Fran
cisco (the game was played at 16th
and Folsom) the trophy was taken
by Cal students to Chinatown.
Knowing the bulky object would be
spotted at the Ferry Building (the
ferry being the only transportation
back to Berkeley), the handle was
removed, and one student carried
the Axe under his heavy overcoat,
with the handle strapped to the leg
of another Cal rooter.
Though all passengers were being
searched by Stanford students and
the police at the Ferry Building,
the student carrying the axe, ClifT
Miller, escaped detection when he
grabbed the arm of the first girl he
saw and gazed romantically into her
eyes. The trophy ended up at the
Chi Psi house on the Berkeley cam
pus.
It stayed at Cal until 1930, the
year of the "Immortal 21." A group
of 21 students had plotted for three
years to get the axe, and on April
1930, their scheme was initiated.
It was the day of the Cal Axe rally.
When the guards arrived to take the
axe from the vault, they were pleased
to have their pictures taken by a
group of "photographers." To their
surprise, there were tear gas bombs
in the cameras instead of flash bulbs
and ink bottles instead of lenses.
The Farm students pounced. After
a quick check to make sure they
had the real axe, some of the stu
dents hopped into their rented car
and sped back to Palo Alto. They
made the trip in 50 minutes ( a re
markable feat with the Bay Bridge
still to be built).
The students who had remained
with the marching Cal frosh began
organizing searching parties, care
fully misdirecting everyone there.
The Immortal 21 became the he
roes of the campus. They were
awarded Block "S" sweaters, given
gold axe watch charms, and feted
by students and alumni.
The trophy remained at Stanford

for three years. After it disappeared
from campus in 1933, a pact was
signed agreeing to award- the axe to
the winning school each year.
With this agreement, which au
thorized suspension from school for
attempting to steal the Axe, the tro
phy lived a quiet life until 1945. That
year two Cal students were unsuc
cessful in their attempt to steal it.
The Axe was stolen from the Cel
lar in 1946. Four Berkeley students
walked out carrying the axe, case
and all. It was rumored for awhile
that some Stanford students were
planning to steal the California cy
clotron in retaliation.
Later in the year the Palo Alto
police found the trophy in the back
of a police prowl car outside the
station following an anonymous
phone call. It was discovered just
in time for the game.
Stanford won their last Big Game
that year, and with the obligation
of protecting the trophy for another
year they constructed a special'
case for it. Costing $700, the struc
ture weighed 900 pounds and took
six men to move into the Cellar.
The case was covered by unbreak
able double, plate glass.
It was legally lost to Berkeley in
1947. In the summer of 1948 it dis
appeared from Cal and was found
abandoned against a tree on the
Stanford golf course. From then
until this summer it led a compar
atively quiet life, putting in ap
pearances at Big Games and rallies.
