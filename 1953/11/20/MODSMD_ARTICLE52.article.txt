## BIG GAME 'Experts' Give Edge to Stanford 
### BILL WRIGHT 
The Stanford Indians of Chuck Taylor will beat the California
Bears of Pappy Waldorf in the Big Game tomorrow -at least that's
what most of the "experts" think.
And it's all because Bob Garrett, the pass master, the Farm's
first citizen these days—seems to know how to throw a football

around. 4

the San Francisco Chronicle: "Both
teams will score three times because
Larson's explosive and Stanford has
Garrett. Stanford, 28-21."
HI D SPENCER, sports editor of

Cal's win over Washington; the
Bears' tackles are not too strong;
and Stanford's passing—who's go
ing to stop it? Stanford. 28-14."
JACK McDONALD. sports editor
of the San Francisco Call-Bulletin:
"Garrett to Morley is the greatest
passing combination I've seen in 35
years; Garrett will produce four

♦

Bob Garrett

Paul Larson


The Stanford Indians of Chuck Taylor will beat the California
Bears of Pappy Waldorf in the Big Game tomorrow -at least that's
what most of the "experts" think.
And it's all because Bob Garrett, the pass master, the Farm's
first citizen these days—seems to know how to throw a football

around. 4
This is what they say about it:
BILL LKISER. sports editor of
the San Francisco Chronicle: "Both
teams will score three times because
Larson's explosive and Stanford has
Garrett. Stanford, 28-21."
HI D SPENCER, sports editor of
the San Francisco News: "I discount
Cal's win over Washington; the
Bears' tackles are not too strong;
and Stanford's passing—who's go
ing to stop it? Stanford. 28-14."
JACK McDONALD. sports editor
of the San Francisco Call-Bulletin:
"Garrett to Morley is the greatest
passing combination I've seen in 35
years; Garrett will produce four

♦
i touchdowns if he throws as many
j as 32 passes. Stanford, 28-20."
CI'RLY GRIEVE. sports editor of
the San Francisco Examiner: "It's
as simple as Garrett, Morley, and
Steinberg. Stanford. 21-14."
JIM SCOTT, sports editor of the
Berkeley Gazette: "Cal has a good
passing attack with Larson; they
have better running and a dangcr
! ous optional play. California, 27-
21."
WALT GAM AGE, sports editor of
the Palo Alto Times: "Why this is
the year I've been waiting for! Not
the likes of the oresent Cal team is

going to stop Garrett and Company.
Stanford, 3. r )-14,"
ROGER WILLIAMS, columnist
for the San Francisco News: "Gar
rett to Morley and Steinberg will
prevail, but with the way Larson
has hern improving, it will be a
great game. Stanford, 27-14."
PRESCOTT SULLIVAN, column
ist for the San Francisco Examiner:
"It'll be Larson versus Garrett, of
course; but Cal has a stronger run
ning game and a little more to win
with. California, 28-14."
