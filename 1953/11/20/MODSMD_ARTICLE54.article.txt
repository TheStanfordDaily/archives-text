# Simplification and Organization Are keys to Waldorf's Coaching Success
## 
### HOMER SMITH 
Discounting their failures on a couple of Saturdays this season, the Bears since the arrival of
Lynn Waldorf on the Berkeley campus have been turned from a confused eleven into a highly
precise and well-drilled football team.
The Bears suddenly quit crossing their feet on pass defense and forgetting to block the line
backer; they started bowling over the opposition with all the zest of a tidal wave crushing a row
boat.
What was the secret of Pappy's success after nine seasons of blunder teams at Berkeley?

Waldorf apparently had two
precepts firmly in mind by
vvhich to effect the cure when
he took up the reins back in 1947.
Something hud to be done and done
in a hurry; the Bear adherents
were not disposed to a long wait.
First precept: simplification. The
[ Cal offense underwent a change
from a complicated and varied style
to one of pure power with massed
olocking ahead of the ball carrier.
Passing was used as an auxiliary
weapon — something they kept
around to keep the defense honest
When Jensen, Swaner, Monachino,
Olszewski, and the rest were rac
ing through all opposition the rou
tine was always the same.
Big, free-wheeling backs behind
big, battering blockers pouring
through the line and into the sec
ondary ran the Bears right into the
Rose Bowl three years in succes
sion. And ran Pappy right up onto
the top of the heap as Coach of the
Year. Pappy himself must have
been surprised at how right he had
been.
Second precept: organization.
Though Waldorf had brought
with him from Northwestern l<is
own start', there was the particu
lar problem uf organizing the
practice sessions and the chalk
talks and the movies and the rest
so that not a minute of the allot
ted time was wasted.
With three teams to handle—at
Herkeley this often amounts to
close to 150 players—and a new
offense and defense to teach, the
new Bear mentor could n«l afford
to waste what time he had for
the instruction and drilling of
players. Once again the success of
the Bear teams attests to the
excellence of the job.
Another factor is the fine work
done by the assistant coaches on the
staff:
Wes Fry, Waldorf's backfield
coach, served under Pappy at
Northwestern and is the person re
sponsible for the carefully tailored
running backs lor which California
is growing famous.
Line Coach Herm Meister is in
his third season with the Bears {>.nd
back in 1935 was an All - Coast
tackle at St. Mary's. Meister is the
only member of the grid staff with
a degree from the University of
California. He earned his teaching
credential there in 1937.
Zeb Chaney originally went to
the Cal campus as a physical fitness
specialist in the Navy's V-12 pro
gram in 1943. He stayed on as an
assistant to Nibs Price with the
basketball team and has since gone
to work for Waldorf, handling the
varsity football team.
Though he's the university's
basketball coach, Nibs Price
spends his autumn weekends
scouting future opponents of the
Bears. Price "was football coach
at Cal from 1926 to 1930 after the
death of Andy Smith and is the
dean of PCC basketball coaches in
length of service.
Just up from Santa Monica High
School where he was in the habit of
turning out All-CIF quarterbacks,
Jim Sutherland coaches the Ram
blers. From Santa Monica Suther
land has sent along such fine ball
handlers as Stanford's Dick Horn,
Washington's Sandy Lederman, and, |
more recently, Ron Knox, who is
with the California frosh.
Hal Grant, who coaches the Cal \
frosh gridders, was the coach of
track and football at Redondo High
School before taking up duties at
Berkeley in 1947.


BRAIN O! jHE BEARS—Head Coatrh Lynn O. (Pappy) Waldorf
is the man responsible for the great success of California foot
ball teams over the past six seasons. Waldorf has the longest
term of service of any head coach presently in the Pacific Coast
Conference. Since 1947 his Bear teams have won 53, lost 6,
and tied 1. Before coming to the Pacific Coast, Waldorf coached
at Northwestern where he was Coach of the Year in 1936.
