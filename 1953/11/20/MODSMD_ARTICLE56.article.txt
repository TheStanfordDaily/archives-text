# Indians' Seven-Man Coaching Staff Is One of the Youngest in the Nation
## 
### BILL JONES 
Stanford can boast one of the youngest football coaching staffs in the nation today. The aver
age age of each member is about 34. These men take their football seriously, spending many hours
a week in order to achieve a workable offense and defense for each Saturday's game.
Seven men comprise the Stanford coaching staff. Each coach has a specific job to do. Scout
reports must be gone over and important facts noted, films must be viewed and weaknesses in
'.he opponents studied.
New plays must be drawn up to meet the opposition's style of play, injuries must be carefully

considered, and of course the daily
practice sessions and the actual game
itself require much time.
Chuck Taylor has done an out
standing job this season. After a j
bad start against COP, the Indians j
have come back strongly and cer- -
tainly much of the credit must go
to Mr. Taylor and his staff.
In 1951 Taylor took a lightly re
garded team to 9 straight victories
before succumbing to California
and Illinois. For this achievement
Taylor unanimously received !
"Coach of the Year" recognition.
In his collegiate days, the 204- 1
pound, red-haired Taylor was a con- j
census All-American in his senior |
year at Stanford, in addition to being j
All-Coast guard three consecutive j
seasons.
During World War 11, Taylor
served as a Naval lieutenant. In 194ti,
following hi.s release from the Navy, ,
he played with the Miami Seahawks
of the now defunct All-American
Conference, where he was selected {
All-Conference guard.
The next year he joined the Stan
ford coaching staff as frosh coach,
where he had a 15 gapie win streak
before joining the San Francisco
49'ers coaching staff in 1950. In 1951
Taylor was named head coach at
Stanford upon the resignation of
Marchie Schwartz.
Dutch Fehring is one of tljb most
vital men on the staff, with his un
canny ability to diagnose a team's
weaknesses. The brilliant, good-na
tured Fehring was an Ail-American
at Purdue, where he won nine letters
in football, basketball, and baseball.
He was named the outstanding
scholar-athlete at Purdye and was
selected captain of the All-Big Ten
team. Prior to coming to Stanford
in 1948 he coached 10 years at Pur
due, one at lowa Pre-flight, and
worked as line coach at Oklahoma in j
1946 and 1947.
Joe Ruetz, the hard-working line '
coach, is responsible for the Indian |
line play, along with Fehring. He
was an Ail-American guard at Notre
Dame and was named to the Service
AU-American team when he played !
for St. Mary's Pre-flight during the !
war.
During the war Ruetz was a sec
ond lieutenant and saw action as
a carrier fighter pilot in the South
Pacific. After the war he played
guard for the Chicago Rockets of
the old All-American Conference |
and earned a Master's degree in
anthropology at Chicago University. {

State, Kent State, and Oklahoma.

backs in Stanford history. He was
a teammate of Taylor on the 1940
Stanford Rose Bowl team. He ran
back a punt for a touchdown in
Stanford's victory over Nebraska
in the Rose Bowl game.

Star team in 1945
