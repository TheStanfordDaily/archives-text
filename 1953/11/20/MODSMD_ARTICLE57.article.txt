# Great Rivalry Features Past Big Games
## Cal-Card Series Stands At 23 Wins Each, Nine Ties Stanford All-Americans 
### PHIL BERMAN 
Great rivalries have dotted the American football scene down
through the years since they started the annual aurtimnal mad
ness back in 1869. You have Harvard-Yale, Army-Navy, Michi
gan-Minnesota, Texas-Texas A <& M, USC-UCLA among the many
traditional games.
But there is one rivalry which has over the years stood out

above all the rest. It is the rivalry t
which outshines them all with color, I
tradition, as well as close, exciting I
contests. It is the game that every
one knows what you are talking
about when you mention the Big ]
Game. For the Big Game means
Stanford and California.
This is the 56th renewal of the j
Big Game which got its start back
in 1892 with a couple of breaks out
for two wars. The standings are all
even in the all-time series, each
school having won the Big Game
23 times with nine ties.
in between there have been some |
of the finest and most tiyilling grid
iron games ever staged, with some i
of the greatest players ever to hit !
the American football picture.
All-Americans Galore
For Stanford there's Ernie Nevers, ;
Monk Moscrip, Ted Shipkey, Dick I
Hyland, Jim Lawson, Bill Corbus, 1
Bobby Grayson, Chuck Taylor, I
Frankie Albert, Pete Kinetovic, Bill
McColl, and Gary Kerkorian.
The Bears have also had their
share of stars down through the
decades with Brick Muller, Roy Rie
gals, Sam Chapman, Boots Erb, j
Perry Schwartz, Vic Bottari, Bob i
Reinhard, Rod Franz, Jackie Jensen,
and Les Richter.
Upsets have been the rule rather j
than the exception in the long riv- J
airy.
The Indians upset the Bears in the
Very first meeting of the scliools on j
March 19, 1892 at the Haight Street
Ball Grounds in Sun Francisco. Stan
ford won, 14 to 10, in a game that j
was delayed "because someone for- '
got to bring along a football."
A Stanford student named Herbert
Hoover happened to be manager of
tiie Stanford team at the time.
Football Di>continued
In 1906 the two schools gave up
football for eight years, but con
tinued to play the Big Game on the
rugby field.
California recorded its biggest
score in the series in 1921 with a 42
to 7 win. This was the second of
three one-sided Bears victories that
featured Andy Smith and the Cal
"Wonder Team."
In looking back over the many
great games, it is difficult to say
which was the most outstanding,
but probably the best of all time was
the 1924 game which ended in a
20 to 20 tie.
A crowd of 80,000 in the California
Memorial Stadium saw a fighting
of Indians roar back to score
14 points in the closing ten minutes
after Cal had seemingly won a 20 to
6 decision.
End Ted Shipkey and halfback
Murray Cuddeback sparked the re
surgence, the latter booting two
field goals and two extra points be
sides scoring one of the touchdowns.
Cards Tally Twice
Shipkey, an Ail-American two
years later, made a spectacular
catch to get things rolling, while
Cuddeback tallied the final touch
down with three minutes left, and
then kicked the crucial extra point.
Walter Camp called it the greatest
game ever played.
It was Stanford's turn to gloat
the next few years, and they tallied
their highest point totals of the se
ries with 41 to 6 in 1926 and 41 to 0
in 1930.
The Vow Boys recorded a notable
upset in 1935 with a 13 to 0 triumph
over the Bears, as the Cards handed
Cal their only setback of the season.

After several years of disaster,
Frankie Albert and Pete Kmetovic
finally got Stanford back on the
Big Game win trail with a 13 to 7
win in 1940.
Cal Scores Upset
But the very next year Jim Jurk
ovich and Bob Reinhard engineered
a 16 to 0 upset win for Cal, probably
their greatest Big Game win. Frankie
Albert and the T-formation were
rendered virtually helpless that day.
Stanford scored a 26 to 7 win in
i 1942 in the last game before the war.
The Indians got possession of the
Axe for the last time in 1946 when
! the series was renewed following
the war, by squashing the Bears
j 25 to 6. This game ended up with
s the Cal rooting section screaming for
J the neck of Frank Wickhorst, the
Cal coach.
Probably the most outstanding
game in recent years was the 21 to
18 Cal win in 1947.
An underdog Stanford eleven,
j paced by George Quist, Don Camp
bell, and Bob Anderson, which had
lost" every game so far that season,
, gave a California team, undefeated
in nine starts, all it could handle, and
with three minutes to play, led the
I "unbeatable" Bears" 18 to 14.
Jensen Passes TD
Then Paul Keckley, a sub half
back for California, took a cross
field pass from Jackie Jensen and
romped 60 yards to paydirt. Jim
Cullom kicked his third conversion
to give the Bears their three-point
1 edge.
In 1948 the Cards almost did it
again, as once again heavy under
dogs to California, they bowed 7 to 6.
Jim Cullom was the difference this
; time too as he kicked the crucial
extra point for the Bears, while later
in the game he blocked Aubrey De
vine's attempted conversion.
Stanford really thought they could
[ take Cal in 1949 after walloping
USC only weeks before. But
[ the Waldorf machine with Pete
Schabaruni and Jim Monachino run
ning wild, chewed up the Cards 33
to 14.
Seniors will well remember the
7 to 7 tie in 1950, "The game Stanford
should have won." Gary Kerkorian
played an outstanding game for the
I Indians, completing 17 passes for
212 yards. Giant end Bill McColl
almost won the thing when he tossed
| a 70-yard pass through the air which
just slipped through Bob Bryan's
| fingertips on the goal line.
Hose Bowl Squad
The Bears soiled the previously
j undefeated record of the Stanford
' Rose Bowl team in 1951 when they
| halted the Indians 20 to 7.
Cal rolled up 306 yards rushing,
with Donnie Harris, Johnny Pappa,
| and Don Robi.-on running amok.
Bill McColl gave the crowd another
j thrill with his long pass attempt
I antics.
Last year the Bears ripped
j through the injury-riddled Stanfords
26 to 0 as Johnny Olszewski ac
| counted for 122 yards rushing, while
substitute Ray Willsey, filling in for
the hurt Billy Mais in the quarter
j back slot, amazed one and all with
I his passing and running.
And so we come to 1953, in what
should be another great Big Game.
This time it's Bob Garrett against
Paul Larson, two of the top colle
igiate passers in the nation. We
i don't want to say who'll win, but
| remember, anything can happen in
I the Big Game, and it probably will.

necke, center on the 192!) team.

California has won the PCC foot
ball championship seven times since
1916 and the Bears have been in
volved in three ties for the title.
The Indians have been on top of the
heap five times over the same pe
riod and, like the Bears, have been
involved in three ties. However, the
Indians have been to the Rose Bowl
nine times, the Bears only seven.

On the eve of the 1894 Big Game
a disgruntled California undergrad
uate fired a revolver at close range
at a Stanford tackle; the shot
wounded him and grazed another
player. Both were out of action the
following day and the case was
hushed-up and settled out of court.
