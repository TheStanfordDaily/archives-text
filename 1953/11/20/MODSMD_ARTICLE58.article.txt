# Seniors Seek 1st Big Game Win
## Daily Sports 
### DON STEPHENS 
Back in 1925 the Indians and the
Bears were tied for the conference
lead going into the Big Game. The
two teams played to a stand-off,
20-20 tie, but the Indians wei'e sub
sequently voted into the Rose Bowl
to face Notre Dame and the Four
Horsemen.

In 1947 the Bears, having lost only
to USC, were an overwhelming fa
vorite to annihilate the Indians.
Stanford fought the Bears toe-to
toe for four quarters and lost by
the margin of three missed extra
points, 18-21.

Bobby Garrett will lead 16 graduating seniors into the Stan
ford Stadium bowl tomorrow to rectify a situation that has plagued
them during their four years on the Farm—the Big Game.
The closest any Stanford squad came during that time was
the memorable 7 to 7 tie back in 1950.
This will have to be a winning effort, for over on the Berkeley

campus come reports that the Gold
en Horde is only losing 15 seniors,
six of whom are first-line troops.
It may be a little premature, but
most experts give the Bears the nod
to cop the PCC crown and the Rose
Bowl bid next year.
The Indians will lose their offense
via the graduating route, when Mr.
Garrett, Sam Morley, and John
Steinberg are*vied for on the pro
draft lists.
Cal's big loss will be guard Tom
Dutton, along with backs A 1 Talley
and Don Marks. Talley is currently
leading the conference in scoring.
Besides the 197 - pound Dutton,
Cal will lose tackles Keith Meserve
and Jim Kotler. The pair will start
che Big Game, along with 18. r )-pound
two-year senior letterman, fullback
.urned guard Don Harris.
The Indian passing and receiving
.riumvirate probably couldn't have
urvived the season if it weren't for
likes of Phil Wilson and Norm
Manoogian, who provide the nu
cleus of Garrett's protective passing
cup.
Wilson, perhaps the most un
heralded Stanford gridder, should
make the Pacific Coast Confer
ence team with his great perform
ances in the UCLA and USC ti
tanics. The L.A. scribes were im
pressed.
Enough praise couldn't be heaped
on Norm Manoogian's squared,
brawny frame. Out with a knee in
jury last year, Norm overcame the
temporarily crippling effects in rec
ord time to make the Wilson-Ma
noogian duo one of the best guard
combinations in Pacific Coast Con
ference history.
Halfb"ack Ronnie Cook, who came
of age this season with his break
away running, is another gridder
who has made the current season
one of the most interesting in In
dian football history. Cookie started
out slowly, fighting off a hard-com
peting bevy of sophomore backs,
being used mostly as a pass re
ceiver, to really become a running
threat when he tip-toed to a cru
cial six-pointer in the Washington
thriller.
He really learned to follow his
blockers after that run. From that
game on he has kept the opposing
defense "honest" so that the sec
ondary cannot lie back just waiting
for Garrett's passes.
One of the defensive specialists
who made the successful switch
to offense, Ted Tanner, is consid
ered by the coaching staff as one
of their most consistent perform
ers. Ted and Cookie, who both
played and started the Rose Bowl
game in '51, will be starting their
third consecutive Big Game.
Another stalwart in the line, Bar
ry Smith, who played his best game
in his only starting assignment last
season—the Big Game —is one of
the hard-luck players on the cur
rent team. Consistently out with
bruises and bumps, he has had to
fight off the dangerous effects of a
slight concussion to maintain his
starting berth.
Guard Lcn Dostcr and end
Marv Tcnncfoss are two football
ers who have suffered under the
new no-substitution rule. Noted
for their fine defensive play in
previous seasons, this pair could
easily have made the stop depart
ment of any PCC team.
Coach Chuck Taylor will lose
eight starting seniors, while Pappy
says good-bye to six.

A LONG-TERM JOB —End Sam Morley completes his seventh
year as Bob Garrett's favorite pass receiver against Cal tomor
row. Morley and Garrett were teammates on South Pasadena
High's league champion elevens before coming to Stanford.
Morley leads the PCC in receptions and total yards gained.


AS THE CROW FLlES—Jarvis Watson drives USC's Linden
Crow off the ground with a crunching tackle in the Cards' heart
breaking loss to Sam Tsagalakis and gang. Bill Rogers is com
ing up fast to observe the landing.


THE TALL TARGET — Long John Steinberg shows how he
stretches for Bob Garrett's high aerial strikes. The lanky wing
man is pressing teammate Sam Morley for the conference pass
reception leadership and is high on the national rankings.
Back in 1925 the Indians and the
Bears were tied for the conference
lead going into the Big Game. The
two teams played to a stand-off,
20-20 tie, but the Indians wei'e sub
sequently voted into the Rose Bowl
to face Notre Dame and the Four
Horsemen.

In 1947 the Bears, having lost only
to USC, were an overwhelming fa
vorite to annihilate the Indians.
Stanford fought the Bears toe-to
toe for four quarters and lost by
the margin of three missed extra
points, 18-21.

Bobby Garrett will lead 16 graduating seniors into the Stan
ford Stadium bowl tomorrow to rectify a situation that has plagued
them during their four years on the Farm—the Big Game.
The closest any Stanford squad came during that time was
the memorable 7 to 7 tie back in 1950.
This will have to be a winning effort, for over on the Berkeley

campus come reports that the Gold
en Horde is only losing 15 seniors,
six of whom are first-line troops.
It may be a little premature, but
most experts give the Bears the nod
to cop the PCC crown and the Rose
Bowl bid next year.
The Indians will lose their offense
via the graduating route, when Mr.
Garrett, Sam Morley, and John
Steinberg are*vied for on the pro
draft lists.
Cal's big loss will be guard Tom
Dutton, along with backs A 1 Talley
and Don Marks. Talley is currently
leading the conference in scoring.
Besides the 197 - pound Dutton,
Cal will lose tackles Keith Meserve
and Jim Kotler. The pair will start
che Big Game, along with 18. r )-pound
two-year senior letterman, fullback
.urned guard Don Harris.
The Indian passing and receiving
.riumvirate probably couldn't have
urvived the season if it weren't for
likes of Phil Wilson and Norm
Manoogian, who provide the nu
cleus of Garrett's protective passing
cup.
Wilson, perhaps the most un
heralded Stanford gridder, should
make the Pacific Coast Confer
ence team with his great perform
ances in the UCLA and USC ti
tanics. The L.A. scribes were im
pressed.
Enough praise couldn't be heaped
on Norm Manoogian's squared,
brawny frame. Out with a knee in
jury last year, Norm overcame the
temporarily crippling effects in rec
ord time to make the Wilson-Ma
noogian duo one of the best guard
combinations in Pacific Coast Con
ference history.
Halfb"ack Ronnie Cook, who came
of age this season with his break
away running, is another gridder
who has made the current season
one of the most interesting in In
dian football history. Cookie started
out slowly, fighting off a hard-com
peting bevy of sophomore backs,
being used mostly as a pass re
ceiver, to really become a running
threat when he tip-toed to a cru
cial six-pointer in the Washington
thriller.
He really learned to follow his

This will have to be a winning effort, for over on the Berkeley

campus come reports that the Gold
en Horde is only losing 15 seniors,
six of whom are first-line troops.
It may be a little premature, but
most experts give the Bears the nod
to cop the PCC crown and the Rose
Bowl bid next year.
The Indians will lose their offense
via the graduating route, when Mr.
Garrett, Sam Morley, and John
Steinberg are*vied for on the pro
draft lists.
Cal's big loss will be guard Tom
Dutton, along with backs A 1 Talley
and Don Marks. Talley is currently
leading the conference in scoring.
Besides the 197 - pound Dutton,
Cal will lose tackles Keith Meserve
and Jim Kotler. The pair will start
che Big Game, along with 18. r )-pound
two-year senior letterman, fullback
.urned guard Don Harris.
The Indian passing and receiving
.riumvirate probably couldn't have
urvived the season if it weren't for
likes of Phil Wilson and Norm
Manoogian, who provide the nu
cleus of Garrett's protective passing
cup.
Wilson, perhaps the most un
heralded Stanford gridder, should
make the Pacific Coast Confer
ence team with his great perform
ances in the UCLA and USC ti
tanics. The L.A. scribes were im
pressed.
Enough praise couldn't be heaped
on Norm Manoogian's squared,
brawny frame. Out with a knee in
jury last year, Norm overcame the
temporarily crippling effects in rec
ord time to make the Wilson-Ma
noogian duo one of the best guard
combinations in Pacific Coast Con
ference history.
Halfb"ack Ronnie Cook, who came
of age this season with his break
away running, is another gridder
who has made the current season
one of the most interesting in In
dian football history. Cookie started
out slowly, fighting off a hard-com
peting bevy of sophomore backs,
being used mostly as a pass re
ceiver, to really become a running
threat when he tip-toed to a cru
cial six-pointer in the Washington
thriller.
He really learned to follow his
blockers after that run. From that
game on he has kept the opposing
defense "honest" so that the sec
ondary cannot lie back just waiting
for Garrett's passes.
One of the defensive specialists
who made the successful switch
to offense, Ted Tanner, is consid
ered by the coaching staff as one
of their most consistent perform
ers. Ted and Cookie, who both
played and started the Rose Bowl
game in '51, will be starting their
third consecutive Big Game.
Another stalwart in the line, Bar
ry Smith, who played his best game
in his only starting assignment last
season—the Big Game —is one of
the hard-luck players on the cur
rent team. Consistently out with
bruises and bumps, he has had to
fight off the dangerous effects of a
slight concussion to maintain his
starting berth.
