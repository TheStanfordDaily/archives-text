# Scouting Is Key to Card Success
## 
### RUSS WILKS 
Much of the success of a football team depends not only upon
the playing personnel and coaching staff, but on the work of the
scout as well. This is one of the reasons why Stanford has had
such a good season this year.
Dutch Fehring, George Lynn, Joe Ruetz and Bob Ghilotti make

up the scouting staff. The team's
record speaks well for their services.
First glance at a scouting report
would lead one to think that it was
a conglomeration of meaningless
diagrams and figures, but in reality
it is a scientific study of a football
g^me.
If you were to go with a scout on
a Saturday afternoon, say to watch
California, you would see him attend
the game with a folder full of of
fensive and defensive charts. You
would go into the press box to view
the game. Some scouts like to watch
tb •> game from the end zone so they
can see the holes opening up, but
it is easier to work in the confines
of a booth with a table in front of
you. After observing the information
that Stanford scouts turn in it
doesn't seem plausible that they
could get any additional facts with
a • end zone view.
From the opening kick-off until
the last play of the game, every of
«fcnsivc play of the scouted team
is charted. The down, the play,
the yardage, the formation, the
ball carrier and the type of defense
the play was run against are all
X>ted.
The unscouted team's offense is
charted in this manner for maybe
a quarter 01* a half to determine if
Cal uses any defensive pattern. That
is, does California shoot a line-back
er through, does the end drop off on
a pass, do the halfbacks come up fast
0. runs, etc.
During the game the scout is con
stantly at work. Aside from the
aforementioned, he has to diagram j
offensive and defensive formations, j
chart kick-off plays noting who gets ,
down the field fast, who blocks well, I
etc., and aside from all this, a very
important phase of his scouting is |
to make general notes on every ;
player in the game for California.
When the final gun sounds the
scout must tabulate and summarize
what has transpired on the-field be
low. He draws up Cal's offensive
foymations (in this case there were
6 and he designates how
many running plays were called
from each pattern, for what total
yardage, and indicates the average
yardage per play. He does the same
for the passing game.
Then 011 another sheet he totals
'V number of plays run through
ine line. For instance, say Cal en- j
gineered seven runs around right
end. However, the plays may have ,
differed. The scout indicates i
whether it was a dive, a fire, a
sweep, etc., and indicates the num
ber of the play, for instance a 29 |
J ive (in football lingo the 2 back j
running through the !) hole) may
have been run 4 times for 7 yards.
This process is recorded for the
ten holes in the line and the passes
are also included. At a quick glance
you can tell where Cal likes to run
and how successful it has been. After
t' "s is done the scout diagrams how
the opponent's defense reacted to
the different formations.
Then the scout writes up his gen
eral notes about a player. For in
stance, from the 1952 scouting report:
"No. 12 LARSON RH 175 - 5' 11".
Soph. Plays either HB. An outstand
ii.j runner. Next to Olszewski, he
is California's most dangerous back.
Receives punts and kick-offs and is
very dangerous there. Good change
of pace, fine drive and uses blockers
well. Willsey likes to throw to him.
Has carried ball 50 times lor 346
yds.—a 6.9 av." (Season's record.)
When a scout finishes this report
he correlates his findings with the
other Stanford scouting reports on
Cal. Pacific Coast Conference rules
allow each school a three-man
I«ok at another team. That is, one
man may scout a team three times,
or three men can scout one game
two can scout one game and j
another one game, etc.
When all the material is collected
tile scout assembles two reports. One
goes to the coaching staff and one
goes to the squad.
Along with the report goes the
recommendations as to what
offense and defense to use. What
plays will go well and what ones
won't, and other general information
is included. It is evident that the
scout must be able to make sound
judgments on what he sees. Many
games have been won bccause one
knm had a better scouting report.
Monday after practice the Indians
hear the scouting report and during
that week of practicc the Junior
Varsity team runs the offensive and
defensive patterns of the scouted
team. On Saturday the scout will

know whether his time and effort
is to be rewarded.
The only drawback, however, from
the scout's point of view, is that
while he prepares the team for Sat
urday's game he seldom gets to see
what he preaches put into practice
because, sure enough, he is out
scouting another game.


A VALUABLE ASSET — Stanford Line Coach Dutch Fehring,
along with George Lynn, Joe Ruetz, and Bob Ghilotti, turns in
a top-flight scouting job. Fehring aiso helped to develop the
protective cup from which Bob Garrett passes. The ever-popu
lar coach won nine letters and was an Ail-American at Purdue.


SOPH FLASH—BiII Tarr moves for yardage against UCLA as another fine sophomore, Bob Dav
enport, and All-American candidate Paul Cameron move in for the tackle. Tarr, Ernie Dorn, and
Jim Truher form a fleet trio of sophomore backs who will be back to lead next year's team. Tru
her will be out of action tomorrow.
