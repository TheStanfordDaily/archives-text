## 
### DICK KOENIGSBERGER 
For Alfred R. Masters, tomor
row's Big Game marks the 27th
ci \ssic in 28 years of service to the
University over which he will pre
side as Director of Athletics of
Stanford University.
Masters was forced to miss the
1935 gatne, as he v/as East with the
American Track and Field Commit
tee which was preparing for the
1936 Olympic games.
Except for that one game, which,
incidentally, Stanford won by a 13-
0 score, A 1 has been right on the
50-yard line every year since com
ing back to his alma mater in the
fall of 1925.
Masters graduated from the
Farm in 1921, where he was AS
SU president and captained the
Indian soccer team, went home to
Oregon to ftive the business world
a fiing for four years, and then
began a distinguished and color
ful career as boss man of Stan
ford's athletic policies.
Not only has Masters handled his
difficult job with skill and tact, but
as Stanford's representative to the
PCC, he has had a very big hand
in influencing that organization's
policies.
Masters has also served twice
on the United States Olympic
Committee, as well as represent
ing the PCC schools eight times
as host for the annual Rose Bowl
game.
Of course, Al has many thrilling
memories of Indian-Bear tradition
al.
He goes along with many others
in picking the 1947 classic as "the
greatest football game I've ever
seen." Stanford lost, 21-18.
This year, Masters is hoping the
Indians can break the Bpars' post
war supremacy. "Just a one-point
win tomorrow will make me the
happiest guy on earth."
