# Indian, Bear Captains Reach Heights of Great Careers
## 
### STEVE HILL 
Leading their respective
squads onto the field in tomor
row's Big Game will be a pa.'r
of guards who have captained
their teams to fairly successful
gridiron seasons and who will
be hoping to drive their team
mates to a climaxing decisive
! victory that might lead to the
Rose Bowl.
Norm Manoogian 01 Stanford unci
Tom Dutton of California will be
, the two men in the spotlight in the
coin - tossing ritual preceding to
j morrow's gridiron clash. In many
| rctpects they are the same type o f
j player: both were offensive left
I guards until season when the
j platoon system went out; both are
j top-notch blockers; and both have
| been undt»r par at times earlier this
[year because of illness-or injury.
The Indians familiar number
60, Manoogian, an extremely
hard-working, intense competitor,
will be returning to Big Game
competition after a one-year ab
sence with a knee injury that
sidelined him all ol° the 1!>52 sea
son.
The hustLng Armenian from Los
| Angele. is solidly built and very
I muscular at 5-10 and 204 lbs. Ma-
I noogian's crisp blocks and improv
! ing defensive play rank him as one
| of the best guards on the Coast.
Flu and a cold hampered Manoo
gian in early games, but he is now
in fine fettle to help clear the way
for Indian ball carriers to grind Cal
into the dirt.
Dutton is a husky 21-year-old
from Alhambra. lie is 5-11 and
j weighs 197. His older brother,
Bill, is also on the Cal squad as a
I reserve lineman. Coach Pappy
I Waldorf rates the crew-cut blond
as one of the f.eatest downfield
j blockers be has ever coached.
The Bear captain missed consid

erable action at the start of the
;casoß with a broken wrist that is
now healed.
Last ye r Dutton was an offensive
regular in Cai's Big Game win, and
was named the Bear's most valuable
lineman for the season.
