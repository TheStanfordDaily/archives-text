# Good Connections ...electrically speaking

### 
GOOD CONNECTIONS arc mighty important to us
tor. you see, wc make more than a billion elec
trical connections each year. It takes that many to
manufacture and install complex telephone equip
ment in the Bell System.
That's why the revolutionary new method of making
electrical connections without solder — a method
created by Western Electric engineers together with
their teammates at Bell Telephone Laboratories —
is indeed one of the significant engineering achieve
ments ol recent years.
Like mast really creative, engineering jobs, the de
velopment of a tool to make soldcrlcss connections
grew out of a problem. We had to find a way to
connect our newly designed wire spring relay to
other components in giant bays of switching equip
ment. This new relay—something of an engineering
achievement itself — can have as many as 36 ter
minals in an area only 1-3/8" by 1 1/16". Obvious
ly, the conventional method of hand-wrapping and
soldering wires onto the terminals is extremely dif
ficult in such a small area.
After more than five years of research and experi
ment, ition. the engineers came tip with a pistol-like
power tool capable of making mechanically sound

soldcrlcss connections. Shown above arc two types
of "wire wrap" tools now used at Western Electric
manufacturing locations. They literally shoot wire
onto terminals. .. and do it surer, faster and Jess
expensively than conventional methods using solder.
That's not all. The new "wire wrap" tool keeps *
equipment free from solder splashes, wire clip
pings and reduccs bent and distorted terminals.
Electrically, the "wire wrap" tool gives a far bettfcr
connection than can be made manually .. . the high
pressure contacts are stronger, clcaner, more com
pact and more uniform.
In keeping with the Bell System policy of sharing tech
nical know-how with all industry, Western Electric
will make this tool commercially available to '
electrical manufacturing companies, such as radio,
television and communications producers, through
licensed tool manufacturers.
You're right if you think we're more than a little
pleased with our accomplishment. And as we have
been many times before, we're proud of the engi
neers in all fields — electronics, mechanical, elec
trical, metallurgical, chemical, industrial — who
uphold our reputation for leadership in fundamen
tal manufacturing techniques.

That's why the revolutionary new method of making
electrical connections without solder — a method
created by Western Electric engineers together with
their teammates at Bell Telephone Laboratories —
is indeed one of the significant engineering achieve
ments ol recent years.
Like mast really creative, engineering jobs, the de
velopment of a tool to make soldcrlcss connections
grew out of a problem. We had to find a way to
connect our newly designed wire spring relay to
other components in giant bays of switching equip
ment. This new relay—something of an engineering
achievement itself — can have as many as 36 ter
minals in an area only 1-3/8" by 1 1/16". Obvious
ly, the conventional method of hand-wrapping and
soldering wires onto the terminals is extremely dif
ficult in such a small area.
After more than five years of research and experi
ment, ition. the engineers came tip with a pistol-like
power tool capable of making mechanically sound

soldcrlcss connections. Shown above arc two types
of "wire wrap" tools now used at Western Electric
manufacturing locations. They literally shoot wire
onto terminals. .. and do it surer, faster and Jess
expensively than conventional methods using solder.
That's not all. The new "wire wrap" tool keeps *
equipment free from solder splashes, wire clip
pings and reduccs bent and distorted terminals.
Electrically, the "wire wrap" tool gives a far bettfcr
connection than can be made manually .. . the high
pressure contacts are stronger, clcaner, more com
pact and more uniform.
In keeping with the Bell System policy of sharing tech
nical know-how with all industry, Western Electric
will make this tool commercially available to '
electrical manufacturing companies, such as radio,
television and communications producers, through
licensed tool manufacturers.
You're right if you think we're more than a little
pleased with our accomplishment. And as we have
been many times before, we're proud of the engi
neers in all fields — electronics, mechanical, elec
trical, metallurgical, chemical, industrial — who
uphold our reputation for leadership in fundamen
tal manufacturing techniques.
