### MIKE HUDSON 
11 SAM MORI.FY IKS Ml J IS7 JIM KANTI AN H.'!
Mo. ley would bt All-Ahum uan pil'ensive wingman if two-platoon bu'l
were still in effect, but In- v. ill have io settle tor All-Coast honors instead
Going into last Saturday's tiiim . be had shaded !ir> catches to bring hi
three-year total to 91 catches.
Hanifan was a defensive flash last veai who has developed into a good
all-around en<l. Jim Carmichael, i flashy runner in the tradition of his
brother Al. sees action here too. These two should .start for next year's
Boar powerhouse. SLIGHT EDGE TO STANFORD.
5 MATT AKMITAGF 215 LTlt 215 DICK DAY 7t!
Armitage received much praise lor his |>lay in the USC bruiser. He
b especially rough on defense Armitare generally plays right tackle on
offense and left tackle on delen e.
Day is the best oi Cal's crew ol tackles, hut Cal's running attack, which
in the past has been engineered by behemoths .such as Jim Turner, Bub
Karpe. ■etc., has definitely suffered trom the mediocrity ol the Bar tackles.
SLIGHT EDGE TO STANFORD.
till NORM MANOOGIAN 201 I G.'t IHS DON HARRIS 14
Manoogian has been the best blocker in Stanford's disappointing run
ning attack. Oil defense, he has b< en a big rock as the center of the
fird wall has held against sccie o! Lhe nation's most powerful attack:
Most of the vains against Stanford have come outside tackles. Manoogian's
\ll-American luster has beef dimmed by team-mate Garrett's mir:>culou v
passing, but Noun's defensive play for the 1850 club, booming blocking foi
the 1951 Rose Bowlers, and fine all-around play this year will always
be remembered by Card fans and foes alike. He should be great in pro
ball if he cares to try it.
At the beginning of the year Waldorf faced the season with no guard
except captain Tom Dutton, so he converted Harris, who was a back and
linebacker, and Hal Norris. another linebacker, to the guard slot. These
boys have come through and are a tribute to the portly Pappy's brilliant
coaching ability. EDGE TO STANFORD.
51 TKD TANNFR 21.! < 195 MATT HAZFLTINF 54
Tanner, backed up by hard hitting Jerry Goldberg, provides Stanford
with top-notch linebacking and Hazel tine is the only Cal lineman we
would pick over Tanner. SLIGHT EDGE TO CAL.
Hardline figures to be All American center next year. He is almost
as murderous a tackier as was Le. Richter and play*: a little smarter game
at the linebacking post.
«« PHIL WILSON 200 RGL 197 TOM DUTTON «9
Wilson has been the high point in Stanford's best defensive line in
years, and he has been perhaps the most underrated player on the squad.
The graduation of Garrett. Manoo* ian, and Wilson will be the three tough
est blows to next year's model of the Big Red Machine.
Dutton is a gooi! running guard who has been called the team's leader,
the morale booster, etc. "We try to win them for Tommy," one player was
heard to mum I le. He is the best graduating .senior on the team. SLIGHT
EDGE TO STANFORD
8 WIN WFDGF 211 R'lL 211 JIM KOTLER 77
Wedge has finally shaken the in airy bug and has turned into a good
all-around tackle. He is backed up by such fine reserves as Barry Smith
and Dick Gant, who will be playing their last game for the Cards while
Wedge, Armitage, and John Stanton rc turn. EVEN.
It's a mystery to us why Kotler ;ct the starling nod over George Na
jarian. Najarian (pictured at right) is a real defensive rock and sees plenty
of action, but Kotler always win the • tarting berth, perhaps because of
better blocking ability.
