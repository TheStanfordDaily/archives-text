By DICK KOENIGSBERGER
If after the Big Game and the
season are over, Bobby Garrett
should be nominated All-Amer
: ican, the lion's share of the
! credit must go to Garrett him
self, and some of the credit mast
go to his tremendous receivers,
j but a large share of the credit
i must go to Stanford's top-flight
Athletic News Publicist Don
Liebendorfer.
Liebendorfer modestly says:"I
I think all the credit must go to the
[ athlete himself. II I believe a boy
•I merits national recognition, then 1
i go lip to bat for him."

And hat for him Don does, with
all the facilities at his command.
He lines up the local new; paper
men, gets in touch with the nation
wide news services, and lie puts to
use many friends and contacts
which he has made in his almost 30
years on the job. as he makes sure
the exploits and the vital statistics
of the deserving athlete receive no
tice throughout the country.
That's Don Liebendorfer, publicity
director deluxe, who at this writing
is probably rushing about in a last
minute bustle, putting the finishing
touches on the preparations he has
been working on for months for to
day's California-Stanford game.
Tomorrow's encounter in a r k s
(lie 2!) th Big Ciame for Lieben
dorfer -,ince he took the job of
publicity director in 1924. Inci
dentally, Don was the first man
ever appointed by a major college
to the full-time job of spreading
the institution's athletic name and
good will.
Don has many outstanding mem

ories oI the Bay Area classics to si
buck and reminisce about.
He rates two of these games a
the one:- which provided him wit.
his greatest individual thrills: or
because it wa so'exciting, and tl
other becau e il was so well pla; ••
He remembers the 3924 game «
the most exciting. That was tl
game in which Stanford, trailing 20
G with live minutes left in the gam<
scored two quick touchdowns 1
make the final score 20-all.
The best-played game was tin
1547 game, into which the Indite
went without a single win for the
season, and losl in the final sec
onds |>y a 21-18 margin.
The liig Game is always the big
point of the year for Don. He ssij*:
"No matter all the headaches i
preparing for the game—the tele
phone calls for tickets, the pro
grain . and the enemies which m
job sometimes brings me—the mo
mont I sit. down in the press bo
for the big one, a chill always goe
down my spine."

That's Don Liebendorfer, publicity
director deluxe, who at this writing
is probably rushing about in a last
minute bustle, putting the finishing
touches on the preparations he has
been working on for months for to
day's California-Stanford game.
Tomorrow's encounter in a r k s
(lie 2!) th Big Ciame for Lieben
dorfer -,ince he took the job of
publicity director in 1924. Inci
dentally, Don was the first man
ever appointed by a major college
to the full-time job of spreading
the institution's athletic name and
good will.
Don has many outstanding mem

ories oI the Bay Area classics to si
buck and reminisce about.
He rates two of these games a
the one:- which provided him wit.
his greatest individual thrills: or
because it wa so'exciting, and tl
other becau e il was so well pla; ••
He remembers the 3924 game «
the most exciting. That was tl
game in which Stanford, trailing 20
G with live minutes left in the gam<
scored two quick touchdowns 1
make the final score 20-all.
The best-played game was tin
1547 game, into which the Indite
went without a single win for the
season, and losl in the final sec
onds |>y a 21-18 margin.
The liig Game is always the big
point of the year for Don. He ssij*:
"No matter all the headaches i
preparing for the game—the tele
phone calls for tickets, the pro
grain . and the enemies which m
job sometimes brings me—the mo
mont I sit. down in the press bo
for the big one, a chill always goe
down my spine."

If after the Big Game and the
season are over, Bobby Garrett
should be nominated All-Amer
: ican, the lion's share of the
! credit must go to Garrett him
self, and some of the credit mast
go to his tremendous receivers,
j but a large share of the credit
i must go to Stanford's top-flight
Athletic News Publicist Don
Liebendorfer.
Liebendorfer modestly says:"I
I think all the credit must go to the
[ athlete himself. II I believe a boy
•I merits national recognition, then 1
i go lip to bat for him."

And hat for him Don does, with
all the facilities at his command.
He lines up the local new; paper
men, gets in touch with the nation
wide news services, and lie puts to
use many friends and contacts
which he has made in his almost 30
years on the job. as he makes sure
the exploits and the vital statistics
of the deserving athlete receive no
tice throughout the country.
