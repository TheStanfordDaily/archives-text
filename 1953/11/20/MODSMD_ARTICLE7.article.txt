# Rally, Bonfire Kindle Big Game Spirit, Set Fast Pace for Blazing Weekend
## 
### BOB REZAK 
Upwards of 5,000 jubilant Stanfordites and Peninsulans turned
out en masse last night on the "dry" bed of Lake Lagunita for the
traditional Big Game bonfire rally, and loudly, sometimes wildly,
proclaimed a Stanford victory over California tomorrow.
They cheered and waved pom-poms frantically when Coach

cnucK layior toki tnern mis is tne
greatest team we've ever had." And
they listened attentively to the
bare-headed mentor when he said:
"I don't know if it's from the
standpoint of material or personal
abilities, but I'm sure it's from
spirit, determination, and down
right fight!"
In the midst of his speech Taylor
said to the enthusiastic crowd of
Stanford rooters that he thought
"the time is right for victory."
So did the crowd, which acknowl
edged Taylor's oratory with a tu
multuous Bix Six yell. And up on
the Boathouse platform the coach's
pretty wife and two children—Su
san, five, and Douglas, two and a
half—joined in the ovation.
Team captain Norm Manoogian
drew cheers when he thanked the
Stanford rooters for "the wonderful
support we've had all year . ,
"Don't let up," he pleaded.
Ilead yell leader Ilowie Rubin,
his assistants, and pom-pom girls,
resplendent in red and white, led
rooters in songs and yells includ
ing (be famed "Give 'Em the
Axe!" The Axe, however, is still
missing, but the Rally Committee
provided a massive crepe paper
replica which adorned the plat
form.
The rooters, clad in an array of
rain gear, braved ankle-deep mud
and sporadic showers from a cloudy
sky to witness an exciting display
of fireworks bursting in assorted
colors above them.
Then came the big moment. Walt
Hays, freshman class president, put
a flaming torch to the 57-foot bon
fire and huge orange flames licked

up over the oil - drenched pyre i
which was topped by Oskie, Cal
mascot, who burned in effigy.


UP IN SMOKE—Thousands of Stanford rooters crowded the bed of Lake Lag to see the bonfire
topped by Oskie, the California Bear, go up in a cloud of smoke and flame. Before the fire the
rooters took part in a rally featuring Coach Chuck Taylor and team Captain Norm Manoogian
as speakers, and songs and yells led by Howie Rubin. A display of fireworks was presented
by Shell Oil Company. —Daily photo by Frank Huntress
