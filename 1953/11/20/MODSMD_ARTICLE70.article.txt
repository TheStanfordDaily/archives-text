12 JOHN STEINBERG 1»8 REL 20(1 JOE HIBBS 8J
Steinberg caught 25 passes for three touchdowns in the first eight games
and has turned into a good defensive wingman. He is perhaps Stanford's
flashiest open field runner and should cap off an ever-improving three years
with his best performance Saturday. •
Hibbs has caught a few long passes this year, but he is still in the old
Cal tradition of having big thugs at end who are good downfield blockers
and defensive stars, but miserable pass catchers. Sophomore Cliff Wright
plays here when a more adept pass snagger is needed. EDGE TO STAN
FORD.
17 808 GARRETT 190 QB ISO PAUL LARSON 12
If Garrett doesn't make All-America, it will be a brutal indictment of
the present system of picking the mythical eleven. He has compfetely over
shadowed pre-season hotshots such as Jackie Parker and Leon Hardeman,
yet they may get the nod because an All-America team that, say, comes
out in the December 1 edition of the Saturday Evening Post was picked
in late October. What people tend to forget about Garrett's fantastic hurl
ing is that he had his greatest days with the Coast's best defensive backs,
Bill Stits and Lindon Crow, guarding Sam Morley. Cal has no back of this
caliber ami Garrett should rewrite the Big Game record books. Besides his
peerless passing, he leads the PCC in interceptions. He is a sharp tackier,
but his lack of speed may enable Cal's speedsters to get off on an occaional
iong jaunt. (
How can a scatter-arm like Larson be such a great passer? The answer
is that he runs around the backfield until he finds a receiver in the clear
and then lobs one to him. His magnificent rushing ability forces the ends
to box wide and the rest of the linemen to sneak in on him. He has started
a new trend in quarterbacks. He might be Ail-American quarterback
next year, and then again he might be second string for Cal or more likely
first-string halfback, as frosh flash Ronnie Knox showed unlimited poten
tial in single-handedly defeating the Stanford frosh three weeks ago. Lar
son is outstanding on defense too, and all-in-all he is one of the three
great backs on the coast. SLIGHT EDGE TO STANFORD.
24 ERNIE HORN 175 IlflL 170 AL TALLEY 43
The tough Dorn has been a big come-through for the Cards this year.
The stubby sophomore lacks Talley's pass defense ability, but he is a hard
hitter both on offense and defense. SLIGHT EDGE TO CAL.
Talley is the flashiest Cal runner and the team's finest defensive back,
but he can generally be counted on for about a fumble a game.
25 RON COOK 181 LHR 15)0 DON MARKS 45
Cook has not been as consistent a gainer as Marks, but he has galloped
for three long runs this year and is the number three pass snagger in the
league. He will cap three years of first-string play tomorrow. EVEN.
Marks follows in the tradition of hard-running halfbacks established by
such drivers as Jim Monachino, Pete Schabarujn, Don Johnson, and Jack
Swaner. He's a hard hitter who will always'get his 50 yards per game. He
is backed by Jerry Drew, a sophomore who should be outstanding as soon
as he can think as fast as he can ramble.
.{7 MARSII HOWE 192 FB JIM DILLON 34
Howe wins the nod over a crew of pretty good fullbacks because of his
blocking and linebacking abliity, but he is not a first-class runner.
Dillon was moved from end by Waldorf to fill the large hole vacated
by the graduation of Johnny Olszewski. He and his sub Steve DimefT have
been outstanding linebackers, but the Cal running attack is definitely not
the awesome stampede of old. SLIGHT EDGE TO CAL.
$ sjc I.H
Stanford G-3-2. Cal's defensive line can be moved against, but Stanford
does not have the running offense to take much advantage of it. Cal's
passing defense rates about a B—. It's good, but not any better than that
of USC or UCLA. So, it will be the old story of throw, throw, throw the
ball gently down the field.
As for Cal, no longer do they present a running attack that can grind
out 300 yards a game. Their offense is led by a weird new species of back
that out-Celeris Bob Celeri. Paul Larson is never quite sure what the
play is until he has done it,
Although Garrett and Larson will grab the spotlight, we wonder if the
real heroes aren't Waldorf and Chuck Taylor. Hark back to Sept. 10. On
that gloomy day COP beat Stanford 25 to 20 while Baylor whitewashed Cal
25 to 0. Week after week of painstaking worlf has developed the two
squads -to wherfe they now rate as two of the top 20 teams in the nation.
If the Cal and Stanford staffs coached the present USC and/or UCLA teams,
we honestly feel they would produce a national champion.
Stanford figures to defeat Cal. Cal has been way up for the last two
Big Games, but we think the Cards won't muff this chance. Each team
should score at least three times and Bob Garrett's fine kicking toe might
spell the difference.
P.S. If we don't beat Cal this year, look for another dry spell. Next
year's Cal squad could be the national champ.
