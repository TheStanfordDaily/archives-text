# Stanford Gridders May Maneuver on the Ground Next Season With Graduation of Garrett and Ends
## 
### NEIL MacPHAIL 
There's a possibility that Stanford Stadium will not be showered
with passes next year.
In all probability touchdown drives will consist of gains of
three and four yards a play. Coach Chuck Taylor may have to
form his offense around a runnihg attack for the first time in his

coaching career, unless a quarter-'
back and a couple of ends are un
covered at spring practice.
The pass-catching team oi' Garrett,
Morley, and Steinberg graduate next
spring and along with them exits
Stanford's pass attack. Jack Gebert
and Don Kafka return to the Cards,
but they cannot be expected to equal
the brilliance of Garrett, although
Gebert has fine possibilities. The
Indians of 1954 will have a strong
running backfield and an experi
enced line except at the ends.
Frosh Paul Camea isn't the an
swer for the quarterback problem
as frosh coach Bob Ghilotti indicates
that with Paul's running ability, he'll
be switched to halfback. First
string right half Ernie Dorn and full
baek Jarvis Watson return. Dorn.
a sophomore this year, has two years
of eligibility remaining. Watson, a
junior, ripped off a 14 yard gain
against UCLA to set up the Indians'
second touchdown, and his value
to the team should be considerable.
Al Cheney, 221-pound fullback,
will also be seeing action next
year. Halfbacks Kill Tarr, Jim

Truher, Bill Rogers, and Al Na
poleon, along with Dorn, will be
back 011 the gridiron next fall to !
give the Indians an impressive j
backfield.
Speedy Ron Cook leaves, but up
and coming freshmen might offset
his loss. Jim Noe, 175-pound half
back, heads the frosh prospects,
while 160-pound scatbacks Hank
Roland and Mickey Raftery might
break into the backfield.
At quarterback, Gebert, Kafka, j
and Jerry Gustafson will pilot the I
Cards. Gebert has the edge, leading j
the Indians through their last couple 1

of games in 1952. He completed 21
out of 39 passes for 321 yards against
Oregon, and showed good form in
this year's Washington State game.
Don Kafka led tTie team for a
touchdown in the WSC tilt, bootleg
ging the last five yards himself for
for a touchdown. Kalka and Gustaf
son have two years to go on the var
sity; Gebert will be a senior.
The succession of many out
, standing ends for the last three
years appears to have ended. Only
John Stewart, 195-pound sopho
more, returns. However, Morley,
Steinberg, and Tennefoss leave
Taylor's eleven. Coach Ghilotti
singles out freshman Bob Gergan
as having the inside track at one
of the end positions. Gergan, al
though small, is rugged both of
fensively and defensively.
The middle of Stanford's line will
be tough. Center position will be
held down by the capable senior

Jerry Goldberg. Jerry has seen
plenty of action this year, being a
letterman since his sophomore year.
He'll be backed by Tom McKenna.
First - string tackles Win Wedge
(211) and Matt Armitage (215) head
the tackles; however, John Stanton,
Joel Sappenfield, Chris Marshall,
and freshman Don Carswell will be
battling for a first string job. Cars
well, along with guard Don'Mdn
oukian, are rated as the best frosh
linemen.
Guards Roy Krickeberg (209), Joe
Long (200). Len Duster (200), Tony
Mosich (204), and Paul Revak (207)
pace the list of returning guards.
Deep in reserves in that position,
the Cards also have Wes Wedge,
Len Doster, and Manoukian.
