# FB Manager Mell Takes Tough Duties in Stride
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
Next to Coach Chuck Taylor himself, probably the man most
responsible for the opera ion 01 the Cardinal grid machine, i3
this year's senior football manager, Joe Mell.
A football manager has far more to do than carrying buckets of
water and handing out clean towels.
Mell performs none of the duties popular fancy would have

a football manager doing. Having*
already served his apprenticeship, i
most of Mell's work consists of j
supervising the activities of his six 1
assistant managers, and doing myri- j
ads of paper work.
During the week Joe keeps busy
by seeing that the' players get out
lo practice on time, seeing that the
equipment is taken out and
brought back, assigning lesser du
ties to the assistant manager and
then checking to see that they are
carried out. Alter getting these
things out of the way he is free to
run errands for the coach, act as
an informal source of information
for the newspapers, and start his
paper work. Joe is the man who is
given such headaches as making
out the complimentary ticket list,
and the team travel rosters.
At out of town games Joe is re
sponsible for getting the players on |
the plane and getting them checked
into hotels. Saturday mornings the }
Indians are pried -out of their beds i
by Mell, who gives them orange
juice and copies of the morning j
papers.
Mell has only one assistant on out j
of town trips, so he is personally in
charge of almost everything. After
he gets the players to the game, one i
might suppose he would have a i
chance to slow down a bit, but no,
he is kept busy running still more
errands until game time. Then he
takes over the job of checking sub
stitutions, a complicated business
under the present limited substitu- |
tion rulings.
When the game is over he gets
everything in order to leave and
rounds up all the players.
After hearing all this it is surpris- 1
ing to see the enthusiasm Joe Mell |
has for his job. "It has been a won
derful experience," Joe states. "The I
best part has been my association
with the coaches and players. Stan
ford's athletes are exceptional, and
the coaches are outstanding."
Joe gives much credit to his
three junior managers. Hap Easter,
Harry Hall, and Bob VVindcn
hower, and to his three sopho
more managers, John Roche, Bill
Emery, and Dan Cathcart. With
out them, he says, he could have
done nothing this year.
The present Card squad he calls
the greatest he's seen. "Not only
great on the field," he added, "but
also they have been extremely con
siderate of the managers."
When questioned about his most
I play, he couldn't make a decision
between the 1951 SC thriller and
this year's UCLA upset.
"Of course," Joe added wistfully,
I "after we beat Cal it would really
make a wonderful ending to my
i year if they vote us into the Rose
Bowl."
