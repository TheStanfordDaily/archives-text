# Bruins, Troy Square Off In Smogville
## 
### IRWIN JOHNSON 
The "Big Game of Southern Cali
fornia," the championship of Smog
ville, the grid titanic of a district
where nothing is mediocre, or in
| other words, the UCLA-USC foot- !
j ball game, will take place tomorrow j
in the Los Angeles Memorial Coli
seum.
Although everyone is trying, it is
almost impossible to pick a favorite
| in this, the culmination of a year's
| football activity. Both the Bruins and
the Trojans have had wonderful j
j seasons, each losing only one game in |
tight tries. The two teams have con- 1
.sistently been in the top ten in all j
the nation's grid polls.
Both Jess Hill, the tactician from
Figueroa Street, and dour Red
Sanders, the Bruin coach, are
single wing men, and will rely to
a great extent on standout tail
backs.
Most publicized, of course, is
UCLA's Paul Cameron, a consensus
i pre-season All-American. Cameron,
| enjoying a good season after a junior
| year in which he was plagued by
! injuries, does everything for the
1 Bruins. He runs, passes, punts, and
! place-kicks when his team has the
! ball; he runs back 'punts and kick
offs and plays safety when the other
I team has the ball.
Aramis Dandoy is a hoy with a
sweet name and a world of football
talent. Dandoy is one of several
Trojan hacklield men who can pass
the ball; add to this his fine play as
i a defensive hack and his terrific
running ability. Aramis, if you
care to remember, ran for over
1(10 yards against Manoogian, Wil
son, Tanner, & Co.
Both teams have outstanding line
men, so many, in fact, that Hill and
Sanders have had trouble all sea
son deciding who should be first
I string. The Bruins' tackles Jack El
lena and Chuck Doud and guard
Hardiman Cureton and SC's ends
Tom Nickoloff and Ron Miller and
! guards Ed Pucci and George Tim
berlake are all candidates for All -
j Coast positions.

The "Big Game of Southern Cali
fornia," the championship of Smog
ville, the grid titanic of a district
where nothing is mediocre, or in
| other words, the UCLA-USC foot- !
j ball game, will take place tomorrow j
in the Los Angeles Memorial Coli
seum.
Although everyone is trying, it is
almost impossible to pick a favorite
| in this, the culmination of a year's
| football activity. Both the Bruins and
the Trojans have had wonderful j
j seasons, each losing only one game in |
tight tries. The two teams have con- 1
.sistently been in the top ten in all j
the nation's grid polls.
Both Jess Hill, the tactician from
Figueroa Street, and dour Red
Sanders, the Bruin coach, are
single wing men, and will rely to
a great extent on standout tail
backs.
Most publicized, of course, is
UCLA's Paul Cameron, a consensus
i pre-season All-American. Cameron,
| enjoying a good season after a junior
| year in which he was plagued by
! injuries, does everything for the
1 Bruins. He runs, passes, punts, and
! place-kicks when his team has the
! ball; he runs back 'punts and kick
offs and plays safety when the other
I team has the ball.
Aramis Dandoy is a hoy with a
sweet name and a world of football
talent. Dandoy is one of several
Trojan hacklield men who can pass
the ball; add to this his fine play as
i a defensive hack and his terrific
running ability. Aramis, if you
care to remember, ran for over
1(10 yards against Manoogian, Wil
son, Tanner, & Co.
Both teams have outstanding line
men, so many, in fact, that Hill and
Sanders have had trouble all sea
son deciding who should be first
I string. The Bruins' tackles Jack El
lena and Chuck Doud and guard
Hardiman Cureton and SC's ends
Tom Nickoloff and Ron Miller and
! guards Ed Pucci and George Tim
berlake are all candidates for All -
j Coast positions.
