# Davis: Leave Cars at Home
## 
### 
All students should walk to the
game tomorrow from their resi
dences, Stanford Police Chief Gor
don Davis urged yesterday.
"We are going to have 80,000 visi
tors in 20,000 automobiles," Davis
said. "When all these cars leave at
the same time, it creates a serious
problem. It blocks the roads for
fire engines or other emergency ve
hicles. Students will help relieve
the situation and also save time by
walking home after the game."
