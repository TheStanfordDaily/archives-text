# NO ONE WON, BUT WE LOST
## Bears Wreck Indian Hopes Cal Shatters Bowl Hopes 
### PETE GROTHE Sports Editor, The Daily 
STANFORD STADIUM. Nov. 21—Some day, somewhere, some
how, some Stanford team is qoing to beat some California tenm.
But it was not the fortune of Chuck Taylor's 1953 squad to bf
that team, although the Indians ended the game today in a2l to
21 deadlock that was as disappointing as it was spectacular.
And so UCLA, whose only blemish is a loss to Stanford, will go to the
Rose Bowl, bless its powder-puff blue jerseys.
Ninety-two thousand live hundred thrill-drenched spectators, a recoid
for the Big Game, are going home limp, hoarse, and with their fingernail ,
chewed to the half moon. They have just finished witnessing one of tha
greatest of Bi« Games, but there arc few smiles on the countenance., of.
those of Stanford persuasion.
It was a moral loss.
St W ;i-. Oh, So Disappointing
The tie was disappointing to Card adherents, because the Indians claimed
a 21 to 7 lead in the third quarter, only to see Cal's masterful Paul Larson
shatter the lead into nothingness. It was disappointing because for th<•
second time in seven years, Stanford had a really good chance of breaking
the drought. And it was disappointing, excruciatingly so, because so many
times the Indians came within grasp of victory, only to have a penalty,
interception, or bad break intervene.
Take, for example, in the last minute of the game when Garrett passed
from his own 38 to Steinberg, who loped (carrying the ball like a loai t>l
bread) down the sidelines and lateraled to Jerry Goldberg who zipped to
the Cal 2'.). The play was called back because of offensive interference.
However, Cal had just as many screwy breaks, and the statistics were oven,
so maybe it was just that no one won this 56th Big Game.
But many Stanford fans would have preferred a loss to a lingering,
painful tie. At least a defeat would be clean cut.
How Wrong Were the Experts
The experts, every one of them, said that Cal's running would In- fat
superior to Stanford's and that the Indians' air game would be superior
to the Bears'. How wrong they were!
Stanford's defensive line was heroic, allowing the Bear ball toters an.
average of only 2.6 yards a carry. On the other hand, Stanford, the team
that wasn't supposed to know how to run, averaged 4.9 yards a (•rack
through the Blue-and-Gold forwards. Ron Cook, the Redondo Bear)'
senior who doesn't run but gallops, led the Card backs with 6.!) yard, i
carry in seven efforts.
Conversely, the Bear passing attack outgained Stanford's, 179 yard:, to
131. Garrett, who had only five passes intercepted previous to this game,
had five of his aerials picked off by Cal, three in the first quarter.
Like in the '48 Presidential election, things just didn't go like they weir,
supposed to today.
Wilson Was lli«' Kesl Man on the Field
And just, as today's extravaganza was dominated by the unexpected, it
was also a game of brilliant individual performances.
For California, Matt Hazeltine played All-American ball. He intercept* I
two of Garrett's passes. And if lie hadn't been at linebacker, Cal':, line
would have been'much more porous than it was.
Naturally, Larson was superb. Although the Card line, particularly
Sam Morley, did a brilliant job of containing Larson's optional pa:,:, run
play, the Hurloek flash was the cog that made Cal move today. His pa:.:,' ,
awkward but to the mark, were what pulled the Bears out of the fire
when they appeared sunk.
But. the best player in Stanford's Big Brown Bowl this afternoon wa ,
chunky Phil Wilson, whom his teammates nicknamc "Animal." Wjl.oii,
who stands five-eight and weighs 204. was an absolute terror today. Wil
son, who is a wrestler and who is probably the most brutally strong fnr.i-

bailer on the Coast, was making
devastating blocks and tackle;; all
over the field.
He turned in the finest line pet -
formance this writer has ever soon.
Not far behind Wilson was raniv/
Barry Smith, who weighs no nunc
than Wilson, but who is eight incht
taller. Smith, who only last Tue •
day had been declared out of the
Cal tussle, broke through to :.me u
Cal backs time after time.
Another reason the Cal runmn ■
attack was contained was Irani
leader Norm Manoogian, who ad
uates in a few weeks. Number 60
was in evidence all over the field,
And there was piano-playing Sam
Morley, who turned in his best dr

But it was not the fortune of Chuck Taylor's 1953 squad to bf
that team, although the Indians ended the game today in a2l to
21 deadlock that was as disappointing as it was spectacular.
And so UCLA, whose only blemish is a loss to Stanford, will go to the
Rose Bowl, bless its powder-puff blue jerseys.
Ninety-two thousand live hundred thrill-drenched spectators, a recoid
for the Big Game, are going home limp, hoarse, and with their fingernail ,
chewed to the half moon. They have just finished witnessing one of tha
greatest of Bi« Games, but there arc few smiles on the countenance., of.
those of Stanford persuasion.
It was a moral loss.
St W ;i-. Oh, So Disappointing
The tie was disappointing to Card adherents, because the Indians claimed
a 21 to 7 lead in the third quarter, only to see Cal's masterful Paul Larson
shatter the lead into nothingness. It was disappointing because for th<•
second time in seven years, Stanford had a really good chance of breaking
the drought. And it was disappointing, excruciatingly so, because so many
times the Indians came within grasp of victory, only to have a penalty,
interception, or bad break intervene.
Take, for example, in the last minute of the game when Garrett passed
from his own 38 to Steinberg, who loped (carrying the ball like a loai t>l
bread) down the sidelines and lateraled to Jerry Goldberg who zipped to
the Cal 2'.). The play was called back because of offensive interference.
However, Cal had just as many screwy breaks, and the statistics were oven,
so maybe it was just that no one won this 56th Big Game.
But many Stanford fans would have preferred a loss to a lingering,
painful tie. At least a defeat would be clean cut.
How Wrong Were the Experts
The experts, every one of them, said that Cal's running would In- fat
superior to Stanford's and that the Indians' air game would be superior
to the Bears'. How wrong they were!
Stanford's defensive line was heroic, allowing the Bear ball toters an.
average of only 2.6 yards a carry. On the other hand, Stanford, the team
that wasn't supposed to know how to run, averaged 4.9 yards a (•rack
through the Blue-and-Gold forwards. Ron Cook, the Redondo Bear)'
senior who doesn't run but gallops, led the Card backs with 6.!) yard, i
carry in seven efforts.
Conversely, the Bear passing attack outgained Stanford's, 179 yard:, to
131. Garrett, who had only five passes intercepted previous to this game,
had five of his aerials picked off by Cal, three in the first quarter.
Like in the '48 Presidential election, things just didn't go like they weir,
supposed to today.
Wilson Was lli«' Kesl Man on the Field
And just, as today's extravaganza was dominated by the unexpected, it
was also a game of brilliant individual performances.
For California, Matt Hazeltine played All-American ball. He intercept* I
two of Garrett's passes. And if lie hadn't been at linebacker, Cal':, line
would have been'much more porous than it was.
Naturally, Larson was superb. Although the Card line, particularly
Sam Morley, did a brilliant job of containing Larson's optional pa:,:, run
play, the Hurloek flash was the cog that made Cal move today. His pa:.:,' ,
awkward but to the mark, were what pulled the Bears out of the fire
when they appeared sunk.
But. the best player in Stanford's Big Brown Bowl this afternoon wa ,
chunky Phil Wilson, whom his teammates nicknamc "Animal." Wjl.oii,
who stands five-eight and weighs 204. was an absolute terror today. Wil
son, who is a wrestler and who is probably the most brutally strong fnr.i-

bailer on the Coast, was making
devastating blocks and tackle;; all
over the field.
He turned in the finest line pet -
formance this writer has ever soon.
Not far behind Wilson was raniv/

chewed to the half moon. They have just finished witnessing one of tha
greatest of Bi« Games, but there arc few smiles on the countenance., of.
those of Stanford persuasion.
It was a moral loss.
St W ;i-. Oh, So Disappointing
The tie was disappointing to Card adherents, because the Indians claimed
a 21 to 7 lead in the third quarter, only to see Cal's masterful Paul Larson
shatter the lead into nothingness. It was disappointing because for th<•
second time in seven years, Stanford had a really good chance of breaking
the drought. And it was disappointing, excruciatingly so, because so many
times the Indians came within grasp of victory, only to have a penalty,
interception, or bad break intervene.
Take, for example, in the last minute of the game when Garrett passed
from his own 38 to Steinberg, who loped (carrying the ball like a loai t>l
bread) down the sidelines and lateraled to Jerry Goldberg who zipped to
the Cal 2'.). The play was called back because of offensive interference.
However, Cal had just as many screwy breaks, and the statistics were oven,
so maybe it was just that no one won this 56th Big Game.
But many Stanford fans would have preferred a loss to a lingering,
painful tie. At least a defeat would be clean cut.
How Wrong Were the Experts
The experts, every one of them, said that Cal's running would In- fat
superior to Stanford's and that the Indians' air game would be superior
to the Bears'. How wrong they were!
Stanford's defensive line was heroic, allowing the Bear ball toters an.
average of only 2.6 yards a carry. On the other hand, Stanford, the team
that wasn't supposed to know how to run, averaged 4.9 yards a (•rack
through the Blue-and-Gold forwards. Ron Cook, the Redondo Bear)'
senior who doesn't run but gallops, led the Card backs with 6.!) yard, i
carry in seven efforts.
Conversely, the Bear passing attack outgained Stanford's, 179 yard:, to
131. Garrett, who had only five passes intercepted previous to this game,
had five of his aerials picked off by Cal, three in the first quarter.
Like in the '48 Presidential election, things just didn't go like they weir,
supposed to today.
Wilson Was lli«' Kesl Man on the Field
And just, as today's extravaganza was dominated by the unexpected, it
was also a game of brilliant individual performances.
For California, Matt Hazeltine played All-American ball. He intercept* I
two of Garrett's passes. And if lie hadn't been at linebacker, Cal':, line
would have been'much more porous than it was.
Naturally, Larson was superb. Although the Card line, particularly
Sam Morley, did a brilliant job of containing Larson's optional pa:,:, run
play, the Hurloek flash was the cog that made Cal move today. His pa:.:,' ,
awkward but to the mark, were what pulled the Bears out of the fire
when they appeared sunk.
But. the best player in Stanford's Big Brown Bowl this afternoon wa ,
chunky Phil Wilson, whom his teammates nicknamc "Animal." Wjl.oii,
who stands five-eight and weighs 204. was an absolute terror today. Wil
son, who is a wrestler and who is probably the most brutally strong fnr.i-

bailer on the Coast, was making
devastating blocks and tackle;; all
over the field.
He turned in the finest line pet -

so maybe it was just that no one won this 56th Big Game.
But many Stanford fans would have preferred a loss to a lingering,
painful tie. At least a defeat would be clean cut.
How Wrong Were the Experts
The experts, every one of them, said that Cal's running would In- fat
superior to Stanford's and that the Indians' air game would be superior
to the Bears'. How wrong they were!
Stanford's defensive line was heroic, allowing the Bear ball toters an.
average of only 2.6 yards a carry. On the other hand, Stanford, the team
that wasn't supposed to know how to run, averaged 4.9 yards a (•rack
through the Blue-and-Gold forwards. Ron Cook, the Redondo Bear)'
senior who doesn't run but gallops, led the Card backs with 6.!) yard, i
carry in seven efforts.
Conversely, the Bear passing attack outgained Stanford's, 179 yard:, to
131. Garrett, who had only five passes intercepted previous to this game,
had five of his aerials picked off by Cal, three in the first quarter.
Like in the '48 Presidential election, things just didn't go like they weir,
supposed to today.
Wilson Was lli«' Kesl Man on the Field
And just, as today's extravaganza was dominated by the unexpected, it
was also a game of brilliant individual performances.
For California, Matt Hazeltine played All-American ball. He intercept* I
two of Garrett's passes. And if lie hadn't been at linebacker, Cal':, line
would have been'much more porous than it was.
Naturally, Larson was superb. Although the Card line, particularly
Sam Morley, did a brilliant job of containing Larson's optional pa:,:, run
play, the Hurloek flash was the cog that made Cal move today. His pa:.:,' ,
awkward but to the mark, were what pulled the Bears out of the fire
when they appeared sunk.
But. the best player in Stanford's Big Brown Bowl this afternoon wa ,
chunky Phil Wilson, whom his teammates nicknamc "Animal." Wjl.oii,
who stands five-eight and weighs 204. was an absolute terror today. Wil
son, who is a wrestler and who is probably the most brutally strong fnr.i-

bailer on the Coast, was making
devastating blocks and tackle;; all
over the field.
He turned in the finest line pet -
formance this writer has ever soon.
Not far behind Wilson was raniv/
Barry Smith, who weighs no nunc
than Wilson, but who is eight incht
taller. Smith, who only last Tue •
day had been declared out of the
Cal tussle, broke through to :.me u
Cal backs time after time.
Another reason the Cal runmn ■
attack was contained was Irani
leader Norm Manoogian, who ad
uates in a few weeks. Number 60
was in evidence all over the field,
And there was piano-playing Sam
Morley, who turned in his best dr
fensive performance today and who
now leads the nation in rcceivin
Bob Garrett, who in the fi > :.L

second tally. Other Cal players are Tom Dutton (69) and Dick Day (76).
