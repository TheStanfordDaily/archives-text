Only Chuck could manage a grin.
Certainly no one was able to yell.
Semi-happy Cal fans—happy because I hoy had kept I lie Axe

left before they filed out of the Stadium to chant "Poor Indians."

And they were poor Indians —the"
disconsolatc, discouraged, disap

trudged slowly, wearily out the
jam-packed exits.
Chuck Taylor walked unhurried
ly across Anycll Field toward the
dressing room, but he could grin

and yellow pom-pom yelled, "Yea,
