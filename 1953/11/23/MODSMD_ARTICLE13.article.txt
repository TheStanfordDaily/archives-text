# Axe Found in Stanford Car, Returned to Cal
## 
### BOB REZAK 
The long-lost Stanford Axe was
in protective custody of the Univer
sity of California yesterday, back
in the hands from which it was sto
len last June, by virtue of a 21-21
tie in a thing called a "Big Game."
The old blade, since 1808 the sym
bol of rivalry between the two in
stitutions, was discovered in the au
tomobile of Stanford football team
captain Norm Manoogian Saturday
a few hours before the Big Game
began.
M a no oi a n , whose car was
parked near the President Hotel
in Palo Alto where the football
team was quartered, said be i
{mind the package containing the
Axe and an anonymous note.
"I gave the package to Joe Mell,
the student manager," Manoogian
said, "and told him to sneak it into
the Stadium so there wouldn't be
a riot or anything like that."
Mell subsequently turned the Axe
over to Stanford athletic director
A 1 Masters who saw that the trophy
was returned to UC sudent body
president Ralph Vettcrlein.
The Axe was then brought be
fore the UC rooting section amid
chccds. It reappeared for a few
minutes at the end of the game—
this time on both the UC and
Stanford sides of the Stadium.
Vettcrlein said yesterday he had
what he termed "proof" that the
theft of the Axe was made by Stan
ford students. He said that UC's
senior Axe-finding committee had
the names of "five Stanford stu
dents" who allegedly took the Axe.
The ASUC president said he

would "know more about it - ' to
day when he talks with the Axe
finding group and Stanford student
body president Don Lozabnick.
Other UC student leaders also
said they believed the purloining of
the historic relic was the work of
Stanfordites. They said they had
information that the Axe was hid
den in the Stanford Firehouse for a
time. Chief John Marston of the
Stanford Fire Department, how
ever, said he knew nothing about
the Axe being hidden there.
The letter found with the Axe
was addressed (o Manoogian and
j said that "in handling this Axe
! over the past five months we have
| been through many trials and
tribulations regarding its final
disposition. The thing that may
•ecm hard for you to realize is
that all events circulating around
its existence—campus vandalism,
etc.—have been a constant fear
and worry to us and a regret if
we turn out to be the cause of
| more than normal amount of
damage to the campus, or danger
to the students.
"Regarding the whereabouts of
the Axe over these months will
probably never be known because
! of the remaining risk to ourselves.
But the success of the whole caper
centered in ihe absolute silence of
all parties. . . ."
The letter urged Manoogian to
"rest assured that this is the real
Stanford Axe, and the same one
which was removed from the plaque
last June."
"Accept no substitutes." it con
cluded.
