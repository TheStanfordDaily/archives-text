# The 						Players Didn't Take It Like a Tie
## Taylor Says, 'Cal's Victory,' In the Quiet Dressing Room 
### RUSS WILKS 
Despite the 21-21 score, there was a stagnant air of defeat in
the Stanford locker room after the game Saturday. A tie was a hard
pill to swallow, harder still for the seniors, who never beat Cal.
Victory was the call of the day, and it was denied.
Players were undressing quietly, some were talking softly with

teammates and well wishers, some
were holding back tears, some
couldn't hold them back.
A little boy was helping Bob Gar
rett with iiis equipment. Garrett
reflected, "With Larson they've
(Cal) really got a great ball club.
1 thought we bad the game when
it was 21-7."
"In my mind this is the greatest
team I've had the pleasure to
coach." said Chuck Taylor as he
sal on a training table munching
a cheese sandwich. Someone told
Taylor he deserved something
better to eat.
In calling this team his best.
Taylor stated, "It lias played a lot
of tougher teams to a standstill.
It's had to meet challenges. It's
improved light along. lt\ a team
that any coach can be proud of—
win or lose. It amazed a lot of
people, including myself."
Taylor singled out Cal's Paul
Larson and Matt Hazeltine as being
the factors in Cal's success. "Hazel
tine did a better job of breaking up j
out passing than anybody this sea
son. He was responsible for Cal's
victory ... I mean tie. We did
tie. didn't'we?
"Cal's comeback was excellent
anrl due to Lar on. We contained j
them very well on the ground. It j
was tile best passing attack we've
run up against."
Analyzing our offensive woes, j
Taylor commented that "Bob was |
playing cautious. We weren't a j
gambling team today. Garrett has j
been operating at top efficiency for j
tin 1 last five or six games; lie was
entitled to a letdown.
"Gee, didn't he look like a streak
when he ran for the touchdown?
He's been the one that has kept us'
together all year — he's been the
spark. He would make a great pro."
Taylor thought that Phil Wil
son, Barry Smith, and Ted Tan
ner turned in top performances.
Concerning Wilson, he said. "He
>hould he mentioned for All-
American. He's the toughest
and the best."
In general the Indian mentor
was "disappointed that we didn't
win and I was even more disap- j
pointed for the kids' sake. They
really worked hard. We didn't
play our best game, but played
the best we could today."
The Rose Bowl and the East- j
West game were brought into the
conversation. When asked if he
thought Stanford had any chance j
to go to the Bowl, he replied, "1 j
don't think they (PCC representa- j
fives who vote) can afford to name i
us. We'd be happy to go. but 1
don't think there is any chance.
"UCLA will make a very fine J
representative. They should give I
Illinois a good battle, if Illinois goes. '
If we went. I'd like to play them. ;
We played one of our best games j
against them."
Taylor, who will coach the
East-West game if there is no
Pasadena commitment, wouldn't !
say anything about the player t!
personnel, hut did indicate that/
Garrett would play.
The most a school can send to
the game is three players, and he
hoped a full quota would be
named from Stanford. "I wish
Hazeltine were a senior so he
could play in the game and ,get
the heck out of California."
Someone queried, "What's the
outlook for next year?"
To this Taylor responded, "I'll re
lax a couple of days and then think
that over. Hoy. who gets the Axe :
in this case?" They told him Cal.
The question-answer session end
ed when a reporter asked Taylor
how long Cal could keep winning
the Big Game. To this Chuck mere
ly answered. "The time will come."


HE WOULDN'T BE STOPPED —Six converging Stanford defenders aren't able to keep half
back Don Whyte from wriggling into the end zone for Cal's first touchdown early in the sec
ond quarter. Whyte's eight-yard run is slowed up by Sam Morley (11) and Ron Cook (25) as
Matt Armitage (5), Ted Tanner (51), Ernie Dorn (24), and Bob Garrett (17) move up.
