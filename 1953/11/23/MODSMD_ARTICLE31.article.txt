# Cal Celebrates After 'Big Win'
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
Stanford tied Cal, but you
couldn't prove it by the Califor
nia dressing room. The scene
was one of singing, shouting,
and back-slapping such as gen
erally accompanies a big win.
Pappy Waldorf stood outside in
the hall receiving the handshakes
ol friends, and alumni who walked
or staggered up to him and beam
ing as his boys ran the gamut of
back-slappers to the shower.
From the steamy shower room
floated yells and cries of "UCLA is
going to the Rose Bowl."
Finally Waldorf herded report
ers into a side room and rum
bled his praise of a lighting Rear
and Stanford team alike.
"We played one of our top
games. I thought Matt and Paul
were outstanding, but then they
always are.
"We rushed four to seven men to
stop Garrett. It's true that we have
been working ;ill week on pass de
fense, but it is essentially the same
set-up we have employed all year.
After the game I walked off the field
with Garrett and he told me that
we had the toughest pass defense he
had faced all year."
Is Garrett All - American? "I'll
say. That boy deserves every honor
he gets. And that Morley . . . say,
is he tough to guard!"
He refused to single out anyone
in tiie Stanford line, but praised
them as a unit. '"I hey are a tough
crew." Backfield Coach Wes Frye
chimed in to praise Barry Smith.
He also admitted that Sam Morley
had surprised with his defensive
ability.
Waldorf took all blame for the
strange "throwing the lield-goal
tee out while the clock was run
ning'' penalty which cost Cal its
first shot at three points.
"I have rarely been more proud
of a team. They overcame much
more than a two-touchdown lead,
for they were two scores and two
conversions behind.'
How did this game stack up with
other Big Games? "It was one of
the best. You know, there is noth
ing like the Big Game. Not the
Rose Bowl, none of the games we
used to have at Northwestern . . .
no, the Big Game really lives up to
its name."
Stanford publicist Don Lieben
dorfer walked in. "Thanks for sav
ing me -all that headache down
south," he said.
Pappy smiled and puffed on his
cigar contentedly. His record of
never having lost a Big Game was
still intact, despite Stanford's most
potent effort in six years.

for they were two scores and two
conversions behind.'
How did this game stack up with
other Big Games? "It was one of
the best. You know, there is noth
ing like the Big Game. Not the
Rose Bowl, none of the games we
used to have at Northwestern . . .
no, the Big Game really lives up to
its name."
Stanford publicist Don Lieben
dorfer walked in. "Thanks for sav
ing me -all that headache down
south," he said.
Pappy smiled and puffed on his
cigar contentedly. His record of
never having lost a Big Game was
still intact, despite Stanford's most
potent effort in six years.
Stanford tied Cal, but you
couldn't prove it by the Califor
nia dressing room. The scene
was one of singing, shouting,
and back-slapping such as gen
erally accompanies a big win.
Pappy Waldorf stood outside in
the hall receiving the handshakes
ol friends, and alumni who walked
or staggered up to him and beam
ing as his boys ran the gamut of
back-slappers to the shower.
From the steamy shower room
floated yells and cries of "UCLA is
going to the Rose Bowl."
Finally Waldorf herded report
ers into a side room and rum
bled his praise of a lighting Rear
and Stanford team alike.
"We played one of our top
games. I thought Matt and Paul
were outstanding, but then they
always are.
"We rushed four to seven men to
stop Garrett. It's true that we have
been working ;ill week on pass de
fense, but it is essentially the same
set-up we have employed all year.
After the game I walked off the field
with Garrett and he told me that
we had the toughest pass defense he
had faced all year."
Is Garrett All - American? "I'll
say. That boy deserves every honor
he gets. And that Morley . . . say,
is he tough to guard!"
He refused to single out anyone
in tiie Stanford line, but praised
them as a unit. '"I hey are a tough
crew." Backfield Coach Wes Frye
chimed in to praise Barry Smith.
He also admitted that Sam Morley
had surprised with his defensive
ability.
Waldorf took all blame for the
strange "throwing the lield-goal
tee out while the clock was run
ning'' penalty which cost Cal its
first shot at three points.
"I have rarely been more proud
of a team. They overcame much
more than a two-touchdown lead,
for they were two scores and two
conversions behind.'
