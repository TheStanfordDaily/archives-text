# We Gave Them 'The Axe'-So They Took It Home
## SAE and Madrono Mural Wins Sweepstake Award 
### PAT KING 
Stanford went after the Golden Bear with crepe paper and
chicken wire last weekend in the Homecoming house decoration
contest.
Vivid color, as shown in Sigma Alpha Epsilon's and Madrono's
sweepstakes-winning modernistic mural, "Axe the Man Who

Hones One," brightened residences
up and down the Row and over at
the eating clubs.
Thirty-eight living groups exhib
ited 23 different displays in a mighty
effort to "Axe the Man Who Has
One." They didn't get the Axe, or
the man who has it, but they drew
the approval of thousands of Palo
Altans and alumni who hiked or
drove up and down Lasuen Street
in a steady stream Friday night and
Saturday.
Sigma Chi won the sinJe entries
award with their decoration of the
Big Red Machine. The mixed en
tries prize went to Phi Delta The
ta and Lagunita for the decoration
on the Phi Delt lawn with the
theme "Indian Slices—Bear Crisis."
Thcta Xi and Ventura's entry,
"Bear Invades Indian Lair," won
the award as the most humorous.
The most original prize was won
by Kappa Alpha and Branner with
their theme of "Indian Spirit Axes
Oskic."
The Kappa Sigs won the execu
tion award with "He Axed for It,
He Got It."
The judges were Professor Le
land T. Chap'-n, Stanford Speech
and Drama Department; Robert P.
Huff, Acting Chief Counselor for
Men; and Ann Irvine, vice-presi
dent of Associated Women Stu
dents.
