Interclub Council plans no immc- I
diatc change in rushing procedure
as a result of last week's discussions
in Interfraternity Council, ICC
president Buzz Feinberg has an
nounced.
Fcinberg pointed out that the eat
ing clubs will concur with the IFC
in scheduling winter quarter open
houses and rushing. The clubs have
not yet decided whether they will
follow the example of the fraterni
ties and ban Christmas vacation
rushing this year.
"Even more than the fraternities,
(lie clubs continue rushing on a
year - round basis," Feinberg said.
"Of course we have to take that
into consideration before we make
any decisions. The matter of rush
ing finances which played such a
large part in the IFC discussions
docs not, affect us' as strongly as it
does the IFC."
In a scries of meetings last week,
the Interfraternity Council debated
the suggestion that rushing for
freshmen be postponed to spring
quarter. No long-term decision was
reached, but it was decided that
rushing should go on as scheduled
this year, and further discussion on
the question will be held after this
year's rushing program.
Fcinberg emphasized that the
clubs, although independent of the
fraternities in matters of policy,
have always worked very closely
with IFC on rushing, and whatever
the policy the clubs finally set up,
"it will probably be very similar to
the fraternities' stand."
