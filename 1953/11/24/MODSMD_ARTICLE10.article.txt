# STANFORD LANDS
## Annexation Approved By P.A. Council 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council gave
final approval last night to several
ordinances requesting the annex
ation and zoning of Stanford lands.
The action cleared the way for the
University to make use of such mu
nicipal facilities aS sewage and
lighting in two specific areas of
Stanford lands.
The two areas approved for an
nexation are:
A 23 and a half acre strip on the
southern fringe of University prop
erty, running from California Ave
nue to the boundary of Barron
Park. The property, behind the lo
cation of the new Varian Associates
plant, will be used for further light
industrial development.
A 274-acre area along San Fran
cisquito Creek near the northern
boundary of Stanford property. Of
that section, 83 acres will be de
veloped into the prospective $15 mil
lion shopping center. The araa also
includes the Palo Alto Hospital and
the Stanford Convalescent Home.
The approval of the annexation
and zoning ordinances followed a
I brief discussion in the City Council
) chamber on the possible cost of pro-
J viding city facilities to the area. A
J report to the 15 Council members
| indicated that Stanford would as
sume responsibility for the costs of
additional utility facilities.
Council members recorded a vote
of 14 "ayes" and one abstention in
approval of the ordinances.
Palo Alto will permit the annexed
j areas to use city facilities in sewage,
lighting, and police and fire protec
! tion. In return, the University prop
erty will fall under the regular tax
and license fees of the city.
