UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Nov. 23
(UP) —Britain told the Russians to
day to relax because the Western
Big Three meeting in Bermuda is no
more sinister than meetings be
tween the Soviet and Communist
China.
British Minister of State Selwyn
Lloyd told Soviet United Nations
Delegate Andrei Y. Vishinsky that
the impending conference of the
Western chiefs "is not directed
against anyone or any country."
"We have no objection," Lloyd I
added, to Mr. (Chinese Communist i
Premier) Mao Tse-tung visiting (
Moscow to discuss common prob- |
lems with Mr. (Soviet Premier
Georgi) Malenkov.
"I cannot understand why Mr. Vi
shiusky should make a grievance
out of the fact that the President
of the United States and the Prime
Ministers of France and Britain are
to meet together with their For-
Ministers at Bermuda."
Lloyd said the purpose of the
meeting is "precisely the contrary"
to what Vishinsky said he fears.
Lloyd also took issue with the
concern Vishinsky expressed for the
state of Britains' food supply. He
said he found Vishinsky's remarks
"the more surprising" because of
rumors that "all is not well on the
agricultural front" of "a certain
country"—obviously meaning Rus
sia.
Lloyd's statement was made as
the General Assembly's main po
litical committee resumed debate on
Russia's annual "peace" package.
