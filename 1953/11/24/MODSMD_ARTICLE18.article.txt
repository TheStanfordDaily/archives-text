# Italians Accept Allied Proposal For Meeting on Trieste Dispute
## Nations Await Word From Tito 
### 
ROME, Nov. 24 (UP) — The
government announced todcty
that Italy is ready for a live
power conference on Trieste
with no strings attached.
Western Big Three proposals for
a meeting with Italy and Yugosla
via to seek a solution of the Trieste
problem got their biggest boost from
Premier Giuseppe Pella's uncondi
tional acceptance.
Even before the United State ,
Britain, and France proposed the
conference, Yugoslavia had suggest
ed some such get-together, but al
ways with the proviso that it be
bound by no prior conditions.
"Italy has acccptcd in their en
tirety the Allied proposals of Nov.
13 for a fivc-poVvcr conference on
Trieste," a Foreign Oflice spokes
man announced. "As far as Italy
is concerned, we have given a
green light for the conference."
But Allied quarters said move
preliminary spadework remained to
be done before the conference could
be summoned.
Until a foundation is laid, one au
thoritative source said, it would bc
dangerous to convene the five pow
ers because the possibility of fail
ure would create a situation even
more dangerous than the present
one.
The Italian government spokes
man said Italy is ready at any
time. He said the Western pow
ers had asked Italy and Yugo
slavia to "do certain things" to
bring about a conference, and
Italy had agreed to do them.
The Italians took the altitude that
their announcement had checked to
Yugoslavia the question of wheher
the conference would be held.
Italy and the Big Three are
awaiting word from Tito to indicate
whether or not Yugoslavia will at
tend the Trieste conference under
the conditions of the Allied propo
sals.
The Allied proposals were under
stood to have been framed so as tu
take into account certain watered
down conditions which both Italy
and Yugoslavia had placed on at
tending a conference.
The United States and Britain
announced Oct. 8 that they had
decided to get out of Trieste and
hand over Zone A to Italy. Yugo
slavia protested, and threatened
to march into the zone if Italy
took over.
Attempts to arrange the confer
ence were snagged on Italy's rofu M
to attend until Zone A was banded
over, and Yugoslavia's refusal to at
tend if the Allies handed over Zone
A.
After diplomatic negotiations in
five capitals, Italy and Yugoslavia
were said to have tempered their
conditions.
