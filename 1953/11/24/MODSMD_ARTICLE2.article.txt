## 
### 
"The Adventures of an Art
Detective" will be recounted in
the Tuesday Evening Series lec
ture tonight at 7:30 in Memorial
Auditorium.
Alfred Frankenstein, art and
music critic of the San Francisco
Chronicle, will give the talk deal
ing with his research into the his
tory of paintings and their authen
ticity.
The lecture will be well illus
trated with slides, both black and
white and color, of paintings and
details from paintings to demon
strate some of the methods Fran
kenstein used to determine authen
tic paintings.
The "detective" analysis will deal
primarily with the works of Wil
liam Michael Harnett. The Harnett
paintings, little esteemed when they
were done, were almost forgotten
until reintroduced in a New York
exhibit in 19:59. The picture will be
exhibited starting today at the Art
Gallery.
Frankenstein began his study of
Harnett and his school in 1946 and
in 1947 was granted a Guggenheim
fellowship for the work. He is the
author of "After the Hunt," which
is named for the best-known Har
nett painting.
The critic is a graduate of the
University of Chicago, where he
was later on the faculty. He has
given courses at Mills, Harvard,
California, and Stanford and has
been on the Chronicle staff since
1934.
Art. Professor Ray N. Faulkner,
acting Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences, will introduce Frankenstein.
