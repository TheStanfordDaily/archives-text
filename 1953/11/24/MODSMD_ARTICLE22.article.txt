That ever since the Big Game 1
have been lowei than a cater
pillar's toenails? And that my

iniiUeims have shaken rue up worse than a Norm
Manoogian-Phil Wilson combined tackle?"
"1 don't think you .see this clearly." said Ihe Daily
chief rooster, throwing sonic ink in my lace. "Spirits
are down. You have to pick them up."
"Thanks," I said, tryii { to act humble . 'But every
night 1 wake up with r.ichtmares. I keep dreaming
that my head is a foot'udl arid that Paul Larson and
iVlatt Ha/.eltine are : vpting it."

"Gosh," he sympathized.
"And that's not all. 1 dream that Sam T.sagalakis
keeps kicking me in the . iornach."
"Okay, okay, enough of youi excuses. Be funny.
Make em laugh," lie said pulling out his cigarette
between my eyes.
"Ouch, 1 allowed.
'Yeah!" chimed in the mana.'ire' editor, looking at
me like 1 were Harry Dexter White or Jim Scott or

"But, I butted, "ll'ow can 1 be funny? I'm tired

there is no next year. Also, the Daily Californian beat
the Stanford Daily, to nothing in the last 45 see
on ds of play, and 1 feel sorry for AI Napoleon who

"Further, 1 announced, getting up and knocking
over the typewritei and a ireshman girl reporter
with one sweep ol my arm: , "people are knocking
around other people in Indo China; the Chinese are
acting mean again; and I still haven't gotten over
feeling sorry for Senator McCarthy's bride."
The editor and managing editor gave me a dis
couraged look, wheeled around, and trudged back
to their office.
I just don't feel funny today.
