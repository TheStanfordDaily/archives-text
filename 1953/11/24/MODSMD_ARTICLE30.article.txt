### 
The Stanford chapter of the Fed
ei.it ion of American Scientists will
present today the first of a series
of two talks by Dr. Carl Barber on
the radiation effects of A-bomb
blasts. The talk will be held at noon
in the lower lounge of the Women's
Clubhouse.
Dr. Barber has investigated bio
logical effects of radiation similar
to that present in an A-bomb ex
plosion, using the electron acceler
ator at the Hansen Laboratories of
Physics on campus. Today's talk
will be limited to a discussion of the
effects of hi it radiation and radio
activity given off by the blast. The
