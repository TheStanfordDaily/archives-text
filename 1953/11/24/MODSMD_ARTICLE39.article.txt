# Improving Soccer Team Plays Two More Games
## 
### 
The Stanford soccer team, which has shown a marked improve
ment of late, moves into ils last two games with a good chance to
win the championship of the California Intercollegiate Soccer As
sociation.
Tomorrow the booters face Santa Clara, which has not won a

game all season, and a week lrorn ■<
Saturday they meet the mighty Uni- j
versity of San Francisco, perennial
league champions who are unde- |
touted for the past four seasons.
Coach Leo Weinstein believes his '

m,en can triumph over the powerful
Dons, if they perform like they have
in the last two games. In their last
two outings the Indians have beaten j
San Francisco State 3-0 and Cali- 1
fornia 6-2.
"However," says Weinstein, "we
don't want to look past the Santa j
Clara game."
The main reason for the Indians'
recent upsurge is because the once
dormant line has produced nine (
goals in the past two games.
This forward line, potentially a
very good one. has been led this
season by co-captain and left in- j
side Sam Suarez. Sam, a sure
choice for all-league honors at his
position, has already scored six
goals this year.
Playing next to Sam on the left
wing is Niels Vinding, a foreign stu
dent from Denmark, who supplies
the team with unusual class at the i
most difficult position on the team. |
Per Ditlev-Simenson, another j
Scandinavian from Norway, has '
been doing a terrific job at the right j
inside post, having taken over for j
the injured Charlie Andrews.
Dick Koenigsberger, a three-year j
veteran, and Bill Wren, freshman
center - forward from Pasadena j
round out* the rest of this interna- J
tional line.
Amazingly enough, the rest of the I
team, the defense, is composed en- |
tirely of American nationals.
The backs are led by the other
co-captain, Derek Liecty, who
plays center-half. Liecty, like
Suarez, is a sure all-league choice.
Liecty is very capably flanked by j
Peter Mack, a sensational freshman I
at left half, and by Sam Register, a j
dependable veteran at right half. I
John Sentous and John Hanna oc
cupy the fullback spots. These two
seniors have proved defensive rocks !
when opposing forwards try to get j
through at goalie Ken Woods.

two outings the Indians have beaten j
San Francisco State 3-0 and Cali- 1
fornia 6-2.
"However," says Weinstein, "we
don't want to look past the Santa j
Clara game."
The main reason for the Indians'
recent upsurge is because the once
dormant line has produced nine (
goals in the past two games.
This forward line, potentially a
very good one. has been led this
season by co-captain and left in- j
side Sam Suarez. Sam, a sure
choice for all-league honors at his
position, has already scored six
goals this year.
Playing next to Sam on the left
wing is Niels Vinding, a foreign stu
dent from Denmark, who supplies
the team with unusual class at the i
most difficult position on the team. |
Per Ditlev-Simenson, another j
Scandinavian from Norway, has '
been doing a terrific job at the right j
inside post, having taken over for j
the injured Charlie Andrews.
Dick Koenigsberger, a three-year j
veteran, and Bill Wren, freshman
center - forward from Pasadena j
round out* the rest of this interna- J
tional line.
Amazingly enough, the rest of the I
team, the defense, is composed en- |
tirely of American nationals.
The backs are led by the other
co-captain, Derek Liecty, who
plays center-half. Liecty, like
Suarez, is a sure all-league choice.
Liecty is very capably flanked by j
Peter Mack, a sensational freshman I
at left half, and by Sam Register, a j
dependable veteran at right half. I
John Sentous and John Hanna oc
cupy the fullback spots. These two
seniors have proved defensive rocks !
when opposing forwards try to get j
through at goalie Ken Woods.
The Stanford soccer team, which has shown a marked improve
ment of late, moves into ils last two games with a good chance to
win the championship of the California Intercollegiate Soccer As
sociation.
Tomorrow the booters face Santa Clara, which has not won a

game all season, and a week lrorn ■<
Saturday they meet the mighty Uni- j
versity of San Francisco, perennial
league champions who are unde- |
touted for the past four seasons.
Coach Leo Weinstein believes his '

m,en can triumph over the powerful
Dons, if they perform like they have
in the last two games. In their last
two outings the Indians have beaten j
San Francisco State 3-0 and Cali- 1
fornia 6-2.
