# UCLA, Sanders Rejoice Over Rose Bowl Invite
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 23 (UP)—
UCLA's powerful football team to
day was chosen unanimously by the
Pacific Coast Conference as its rep
resentative against Michigan State
of the Big Ten in the Rose Bowl on }
New Year's Day.
The choice came as a surprise to '
no one after UCLA knocked off its j
traditional rival, Southern Califor- |
nia, Saturday by a score of 13 to 0 !
while Stanford was held to a 21 to '
21 tie by California.
Going into Saturday's game, 1
UCLA and Stanford were tied in
the conference with five wins and
one defeat each, and the outcome
of the traditional clashes gave
UCLA the undisputed conference
championship and assured the
Rruins of their third trip to the
Rose Bowl, where they have yet
to win a game. They lost to
Georgia in 1(143, 9 to 0. and to
Illinois in 1947. 43 to 14. in the
first of the PCC-Bi« Ten series.
Even before the announcement
was made by Conference Commis
sioner Victor O. Schmidt, the cele
brations started on the UCLA cam
pus, 12 miles from downtown Los
Angeles.
Classes were forgotten as Coach

Henry (Red) Sanders, his assistants,
and the entire team were paraded
around the campus with the band
and yell kings stopping to cheer the
team as a unit and the coaching
staff and players individually.
From the campus the huge throng
paraded down into the adjacent
Westwood Village business area
where storekeepers closed up shop
to join in the celebration.
The choice of UCLA came as a
consolation to the school which last
year missed winning the champion
ship and going to the Rose Bowl by
two points, dropping its final game
to Southern California, 14 to 12.
But this season the Bruins, led
by their All - America halfback
candidate, Paul Cameron, were
not to be denied, although mid
way in the season when UCLA
suffered its one-point defeat by
Stanford, 21 to 20, the UCLA
hopes almost were dashed.
"This isn't a team that gives up,"
Coach Sanders said in his soft Dixie
drawl. "We're going on to play the
best kind of football we can and see
what happens." And UCLA came
back to defeat, its next four oppo
nents by decisive margins.

21 tie by California.
Going into Saturday's game, 1
UCLA and Stanford were tied in
the conference with five wins and
one defeat each, and the outcome
of the traditional clashes gave
UCLA the undisputed conference
championship and assured the
Rruins of their third trip to the
Rose Bowl, where they have yet
to win a game. They lost to
Georgia in 1(143, 9 to 0. and to
Illinois in 1947. 43 to 14. in the
first of the PCC-Bi« Ten series.
Even before the announcement
was made by Conference Commis
sioner Victor O. Schmidt, the cele
brations started on the UCLA cam
pus, 12 miles from downtown Los
Angeles.
Classes were forgotten as Coach

Henry (Red) Sanders, his assistants,
and the entire team were paraded
around the campus with the band
and yell kings stopping to cheer the
team as a unit and the coaching
staff and players individually.
From the campus the huge throng
paraded down into the adjacent
Westwood Village business area
where storekeepers closed up shop
to join in the celebration.
The choice of UCLA came as a
consolation to the school which last
year missed winning the champion
ship and going to the Rose Bowl by
two points, dropping its final game
to Southern California, 14 to 12.
But this season the Bruins, led
by their All - America halfback
candidate, Paul Cameron, were
not to be denied, although mid
way in the season when UCLA
suffered its one-point defeat by
Stanford, 21 to 20, the UCLA
hopes almost were dashed.
"This isn't a team that gives up,"
Coach Sanders said in his soft Dixie
drawl. "We're going on to play the
best kind of football we can and see
what happens." And UCLA came
back to defeat, its next four oppo
nents by decisive margins.
