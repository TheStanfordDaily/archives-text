# Four Cards Make Daily PCC Team
## 
### 
Four Stanford gridders spark The
D iily's All-PCC eleven.
The passing combination ol Bob
Garrett and Sam Morley earned
unanimous support from the nine
scribes who voted. Phil Wilson
earned seven first-string nomina
tions and two second-string choices
for 16 points to lead an unusually
powerful array of PCC guards.
Lanky wingman John Steinberg
was the fourth Card to make the
mythical team.
Popular Norm Manoogian and
speedster Ron Cook made the sec
ond eleven. Center Ted Tanner and
tackles Barry Smith and Matt Ar
mitage also received support.
Other unanimous choices besides
the great Stanford passing combi
nation included UCLA's big All- '
American hopes Paul Cameron and I
Charlie Doud, and Cal's ball-hawk
ing linebacker Matt Hazeltine.
Rounding out the first string were
Doud's running mate at'tackle Jack
Ellena, Washington's stellar middle
guard Milt Bohart, and backs Paul
Larson and George Shaw. Although
Larson, Shaw, and Garrett are all
quarterbacks, the versatile Shaw
and Larson could and would play
halfback on any tesm that Garrett |
quarterbacked.
