### 
"Christmas in Art" will be the
title of the all-arts Christmas pres
entation of the Stanford Players and

the Stanford Art Gallery under the
direction of Patrick Wymark.
There will be performances at
4:15 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. There will
be no admission charge, but because
of limited seating capacity tickets
must be obtained from the Art Gal
lery or the Memorial Auditorium
box office.
