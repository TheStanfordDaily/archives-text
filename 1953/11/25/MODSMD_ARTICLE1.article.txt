# Sterling Speaks to 200 Village Frosh On university Academics and Finances
## 
### DAVE BROWNWOOD 
"We are building with the strength that we have."
With these words President J. Wallace Sterling stated Stanford's present financial and academic
position to approximately 200 freshmen gathered in the Village Clubhouse last night. The talk
was the first in the 1953-54 "Stanford—Today and Tomorow" student information program.
Dr. Sterling explained that although Stanford could not claim a dominant position in every phase

of education and administration, "in
our fields we can compete with
them all."
During the informal discussion
Dr. Sterling commented on several
phases of University organization,
including administrative proce
dures, the faculty, finances, and the
general University policy — "what
we are and where we are going."
Pete Bing, Village sponsor and
member of the steering committee
of the information program, was
moderator.
Dr. Sterling attributed to the
Board of Trustees a great deal of
the credit for building the pres
ent strong position of Stanford,
saying the hoard is "the strongest
and best I have ever worked
with."
Explaining that all the members
of the board are men prominent in
their "fields who serve in the organi
zation without remuneration, he
emphasized that the job usually
takes at least one day a week, with
meetings each month.
The faculty, Dr. Sterling contin
ued, works with the administration
and the board through an Academic
Council and an advisory board. "I
know of no other institution," he
said, "where there is as close co
operation between the faculty and
the administration."
"There's been a change," he as
serted regarding the question of
Stanford finances. Once the most
richly endowed university in the
world, Stanford now has its share
of financial troubles. The recent
raise in tuition, the president ex
plained, was due to the near-defi
cit in last year's budget.
When the question of Stanford's
position among the colleges in the
country came up during the open
discussion, Dr. Sterling said that the
school is rated among the top four
in undergraduate curricula, and
that its position is constantly rising
due to success in obtaining noted
faculty members where they arc
needed.
"When we want someone in a key
spot we have been batting .750," he
concluded, "which in the big
leagues, if I remember correctly, is
pretty close to a championship
score."
Four other Stanford administra
tors will speak next week to fresh
man groups at Encina, Roble, and
Branner as a part of the series.

with."
Explaining that all the members
of the board are men prominent in
their "fields who serve in the organi
zation without remuneration, he
emphasized that the job usually
takes at least one day a week, with
meetings each month.
The faculty, Dr. Sterling contin
ued, works with the administration
and the board through an Academic
Council and an advisory board. "I
know of no other institution," he
said, "where there is as close co
operation between the faculty and
the administration."
"There's been a change," he as
serted regarding the question of
Stanford finances. Once the most
richly endowed university in the
world, Stanford now has its share
of financial troubles. The recent
raise in tuition, the president ex
plained, was due to the near-defi
cit in last year's budget.
When the question of Stanford's
position among the colleges in the
country came up during the open
discussion, Dr. Sterling said that the
school is rated among the top four
in undergraduate curricula, and
that its position is constantly rising
due to success in obtaining noted
faculty members where they arc
needed.
"When we want someone in a key
spot we have been batting .750," he
concluded, "which in the big
leagues, if I remember correctly, is
pretty close to a championship
score."
Four other Stanford administra
tors will speak next week to fresh
man groups at Encina, Roble, and
Branner as a part of the series.

"We are building with the strength that we have."
With these words President J. Wallace Sterling stated Stanford's present financial and academic
position to approximately 200 freshmen gathered in the Village Clubhouse last night. The talk
was the first in the 1953-54 "Stanford—Today and Tomorow" student information program.
Dr. Sterling explained that although Stanford could not claim a dominant position in every phase

of education and administration, "in
our fields we can compete with
them all."
During the informal discussion
Dr. Sterling commented on several
phases of University organization,
including administrative proce
dures, the faculty, finances, and the
general University policy — "what
we are and where we are going."
Pete Bing, Village sponsor and
member of the steering committee
of the information program, was
moderator.
Dr. Sterling attributed to the
Board of Trustees a great deal of
the credit for building the pres
ent strong position of Stanford,
saying the hoard is "the strongest
and best I have ever worked
with."
