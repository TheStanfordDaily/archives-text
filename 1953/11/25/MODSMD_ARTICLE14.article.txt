## 
### 
Stanford students heading north
for the Thanksgiving recess will not
encounter serious travel difficulties
in the areas recently flooded by
heavy rains, United Press and travel
service reports indicate.
Floods incurred by heavy rains in
Oregon and northern California had
blocked rail and highway travel
over tlie weekend. Southern Pacific
trains were held up in the Crescent
Lake-Abernathy area southeast of
Eugene, Oregon, and several high
ways were closed in northern Cali
fornia.
However, flooclwaters are reced
ing and the Weather Bureau expects
no more heavy rains in the soaked
areas, according to UP. U.S. High
ways 99, 101, and 199 have been re
opened in northern California, al
though U.S. 299 between Eureka and
Redding remains closed by slides,
as do some Oregon highways.
The Southern Pacific Palo Alto
office says that trains are expected
to run on schedule over the week
end. Local travel bureaus expect no
delay or postponement of airline
flights.
UP reports indicated that the only
serious storm now in sight is 1200
miles away and moving away from
the flood area. The Weather Bureau
predicts cloudy skies and occasional
light rains for the stricken areas
this weekend.
