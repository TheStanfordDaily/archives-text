## Frankenstein Describes Art Detective's Work 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Alfred Frankenstein, as meticulous an investigator as a Scotland Yard man, recounted his recent
study of the paintings of William Michael Harnett to the Tuesday Evening Series audience in Me
morial Auditorium last night.
Frankenstein, art and music critic of the San Francisco Chronicle, entitled his talk "Adventure:;
of an Art Detective."
In the course of his investigations, which began in 1946, Frankenstein discovered 38 paintings

iorged as Harrietts. The crftic illu •
trated with slides the forged detail ,
of many of the paintings.
Frankenstein's interest in Har
nett was the result of the painter's
popularity after a sudden appear,
ante in the art spotlight because
of an exhibit in New York in
Harnett, an American still - life
painter of the late 19th century,
was almost forgotten until the New
York exhibition.
"A master has suddenly cornrs
whizzing out of the past," the critic
said, "which seems to demonstrate
my principle that the past is as un
predictable as the future."
Harnett's paintings were far be -
hind the times when they were
painted, Frankenstein said, bul by
some quirk of circumnavigation
they are now considered forerun
ners of contemporary art.
Frankenstein encountered thic;
problems in his study of Harnett ,
paintings.
There seemed to be two separate
styles which the lecturer classified
as "hard and soft." The hard stylo
was distinguished by sharp, clear
edges and a careful placing of the
objects in the paintings, while th<:
soft style had "woolly edges" and u
lot of contrast between light and
dark.
Problem No. 2 was a group <»r
paintings which were signed bid;
not dated, and 1894 dates on hi .
paintings caused the third difficult/
because Harnett died in 1892.
The solution, it developed, wa.»
elementary: Harnett had not paint
ed all the pictures which bore his
name.
Frankenstein began his investiga
tion into the authenticity of th<:
Harnett paintings after visiting i.h<:
preserved studio of John Frederick
Peto and saw many of the object.
which had been reproduced in what
were thought to be works of Har
nett.
The conclusivc proof of the for
gery was found on a painting al
tributed to Harnett which showed
a copy of a United States postal
card. The post card was of a so u .
which was released two years after
Harnett died.
It was Peto, Frankenstein discov
ered, who had done all the soft styJn
paintings which had been credited,
to Harnett. Becausc painting. by
artists other than Peto were found
to have been forged, Franken.st.rin
believes the deceit was initiatd by
art dealers and not by the arti ts
themselves.
