### DICK MANSFIELD 
Frazee, the Fabulous Fakir, was a hokus-pokus
man out of Toledo with a good routine, plenty of
polish, and sure-fire patter. Cardinals therefore spent
a sum of money and hired him for their Big Game
Rally.
Frazee's Big Game Rally routine involved throw-

ing himself into a trance, pre
dicting the outcome of the Big
Game (Stanford by three touch-
this Frazee charged
a special rate), and then light
ing the Big Game bonfire by re
mote control. That's what the
man said—sure-fire.
Of course Frazee was sensa
tional and they invited him to
stick around for the Big Game
itself. Of course Stanford won by

three touchdowns. Of course Frazee was jubilant at
this and decided that nothing would do but he must
have a Big Game date.
So Cardinals lined him up a Rally Com girl and
Frazee took her to the city and they had a big
time. They dined; they danced; they did the town.
The Hally Com girl got home with plenty of time
to spare for her Frazee headed back to To
ledo.
Now, a straight man on the same bill with Frazee
in. Toledo had once attended Stanford long enough to
be baffled by the Intricacies of freshman require
ments, and he had heard that on a Big Game date,
She Either Goes Dutch Or Gets Ditched—SEGDOGD.
He told Frazee of this. Frazee, who was pulling pretty

grim wages, leaped into action.
The Rally Com girl received a bill for $13.29. She
chose to ignore it. Within the week she received a
second bill marked SECOND NOTICE, in red. This
time it was itemized, right down to the gasoline
Frazee had bought for the car he had borrowed.
The Rally Com girl went down to the ASSU of
fice. "Stav calm," they told her. She tried to stay
calm, but in the meantime Frazee had hired a
detective who had taken to shadowing her every
where. They finally summoned the campus cop and
lugged the detective away to the tank for loitering
outside Roth House. Frazee hired another one.
Back to the ASSU office went the Rally Com girl.
"This boy is getting edgy," she said, "but I am not
going personally to cough up the lucre for our Big
Game hi-jinkifes. After all, I was but doing my duty
to Cardinals and to the School!" The Student Man
ager doffed his hat. "Cardinals sent me out there to
do my duty," said the Rally Com girl, "and Cardinals
should foot the bill."
"Fill out a purchase order," said the Student Man
ager.
And so it was.

This fable was written with the hope that in the
future, Stanford women who don't want to pay half
of their Big Game date's expenses will take care to
date only Fabulous Fakirs who are in the temporary
employ of Cardinals. This is the only known way in !
which a Stanford woman can hope to escape the ;
dictates of SEGDOGD, that epitome of fine old Stan- i
ford traditions.
