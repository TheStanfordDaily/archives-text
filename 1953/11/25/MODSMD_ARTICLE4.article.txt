## McCarthy Calls Truman 'Defeated and Discredited' 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 24 (UP) —Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy charged
tonight that former President Harry S. Truman is a "defeated and
discredited politician who has put his party above the interest
of the country, regardless of how much the country is damaged
thereby."

The Wisconsin Republican made a half-hour nationwide radio
;»nd television speech in reply to+

Mr. Truman's speech last week
charging the Eisenhower adminis
tration had "fully embraced . . .
McCarthy ism."
McCarthy, who demanded and
was granted equal TV and radio
facilities, devoted most of his
speech to an attack on Mr, Tru
man, hut he did not spare some
of his fellow Republicans or Pres
ident Eisenhower.
J;> his speech, made in a small
CBS television studio with no au
dience present., McCarthy:
1. Criticized the Eisenhower ad
ministration for not doing all it
could to stop Communism and dis
agreed with President Eisenhower
that Communism in government
would not be an issue in J954.
2. Called for a halt of payment
of "blood money" to any American
ally who traded with the Red na
tions, and for a blockade of Red
China.
Said he was prepared for the
American people to judge "McCar
thyism" at the ballot box.
McCarthy charged Mr. Truman
"made a completely untruthful at

tack upon me" in his speech Nov.
If! in which he discussed the Har
ry Dexter White case.
Mr. Truman, in his speech, re
plied to what he called "false" and
"phony" charges that he promoted
White to a high post in 1946, after
he knew White was a Soviet spy.
He said the Republican administra
tion had embraced "McCarthy
ism." This he defined as "corrup
tion of truth, the abandonment of
the due process of law . . . the use
of the big lie . . ."
McCarthy said Mr. Truman's
definition of "McCarthyism" was
"identical, word for word, comma
for comma, with the definition
adopted by the Communist Daily
Worker which originated the term."
