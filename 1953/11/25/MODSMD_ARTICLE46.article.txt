## Shootin' the Breeze 
### 
Not going to the Rose Bowl? But Chuck, we've made our reservations!
Well, we were talking to Bob Burnett the other day and he promised some
interesting basketball games here during Christmas vacation, so we'll just

write the Huntington Hotel in Pasadena and tell them
to take our name off the list.
Seriously, though, basketball season starts next Tues
day with a game against the alumni in the Pavilion.
After a trip to Seattle to play a pair with Washington
the team will come home, take finals, and open a six
game home schedule during the vacation.
Interesting basketball is just what the Indians will
play this year. The conference is stacked up, with
Cal's Nibs Price going alter a second straight confer
ence championship with Bob McKeen, Jim Matheny,
and Bob Albo, and UCLA's Johnny Wooden wel-

coming liacK) his entire first siring from last season. That's right, all five
men.
What have we got to fight this combination? Ron Tomsic, Russ Lawler,
Oleg Suzdaleff, and George Selleck.
Tomsic needs no introduction. The little junior from Oakland's Fremont
High has been first string for the past two seasons. He averaged over 19
points in PCC play on a losing club last year as a sophomore, with a big
night total of 39 points against Bradley to set a new Cow Palace individual
scoring record.
Lawler is the one big man on the club, standing just under six-seven.
He's the key to any success that the Cards might have. If he can get
bis share on the backboards and hook in five or six buckets a game we
can have a good season.
Suzdaleff and Selleck will hold down the guard spots. Olie is a senior,
;t hustling, heads-up, talk-it-up ball player. Selleck averaged 17 points a
game playing freshman ball last year. He'd be an asset on any team just
lor his passing ability; add to that his speed and scoring and you've got
something.
With the rules allowing five men on a team, Burnett will be able to put
one more man on the court. Right now it looks like a battle between Don
DeLong, Dave Epperson, and Carlos Bea, with DeLong having the inside
track because of his jump shot accuracy from the sides.
Now look at the heights of these five. Selleck is 5 ft. S in., Suzdaleff is
.i It. 10 in., lomsic is 5 It. II in., DeLong is li It. 2 in., and Lawler is the
only giant at (> ft. G'/a in.
But we'll leave it to Burnett to come up with some winning ideas. Cer
tainly the team won't win all its games with such competition as we haven't
had on the Coast lor years, but it'll be a season of hard, fast, cleanly played
basketball.
So it you re going to be around in the area over Christmas, drop on over
to the Pavilion and watch Stanford's 1953-54 wrecking crew go to work.

So it you re going to be around in the area over Christmas, drop on over
to the Pavilion and watch Stanford's 1953-54 wrecking crew go to work.

Not going to the Rose Bowl? But Chuck, we've made our reservations!
Well, we were talking to Bob Burnett the other day and he promised some
interesting basketball games here during Christmas vacation, so we'll just

write the Huntington Hotel in Pasadena and tell them
to take our name off the list.
Seriously, though, basketball season starts next Tues
day with a game against the alumni in the Pavilion.
After a trip to Seattle to play a pair with Washington
the team will come home, take finals, and open a six
game home schedule during the vacation.
Interesting basketball is just what the Indians will
play this year. The conference is stacked up, with
Cal's Nibs Price going alter a second straight confer
ence championship with Bob McKeen, Jim Matheny,
and Bob Albo, and UCLA's Johnny Wooden wel-

coming liacK) his entire first siring from last season. That's right, all five
men.
What have we got to fight this combination? Ron Tomsic, Russ Lawler,
Oleg Suzdaleff, and George Selleck.
Tomsic needs no introduction. The little junior from Oakland's Fremont
High has been first string for the past two seasons. He averaged over 19
points in PCC play on a losing club last year as a sophomore, with a big
night total of 39 points against Bradley to set a new Cow Palace individual
scoring record.
Lawler is the one big man on the club, standing just under six-seven.
He's the key to any success that the Cards might have. If he can get
bis share on the backboards and hook in five or six buckets a game we
can have a good season.
Suzdaleff and Selleck will hold down the guard spots. Olie is a senior,
;t hustling, heads-up, talk-it-up ball player. Selleck averaged 17 points a
game playing freshman ball last year. He'd be an asset on any team just
lor his passing ability; add to that his speed and scoring and you've got
something.
With the rules allowing five men on a team, Burnett will be able to put
one more man on the court. Right now it looks like a battle between Don
DeLong, Dave Epperson, and Carlos Bea, with DeLong having the inside
track because of his jump shot accuracy from the sides.
Now look at the heights of these five. Selleck is 5 ft. S in., Suzdaleff is
.i It. 10 in., lomsic is 5 It. II in., DeLong is li It. 2 in., and Lawler is the
only giant at (> ft. G'/a in.
But we'll leave it to Burnett to come up with some winning ideas. Cer
tainly the team won't win all its games with such competition as we haven't
had on the Coast lor years, but it'll be a season of hard, fast, cleanly played
basketball.
So it you re going to be around in the area over Christmas, drop on over
to the Pavilion and watch Stanford's 1953-54 wrecking crew go to work.
