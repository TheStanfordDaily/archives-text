# UP All-American Team PU In Daily Scribe's Opinion
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
In a decision that compares with Grantland Rice's omission of
Davis and Blanchard in 1944 and Bill Stern's naming Jackie Fel
lows and Jug Girard Ail-American, the UP yesterday relegated
Bob Garrett to its second-string Ail-American team.
However, other Stanford players fared much better on the UP
teams, picked by a vote of 265+ ~

sportswriters, papers, radio stations. I
Sam Morley, whose 45 catches set a j
new Stanford record and were one '
short ot the PCC mark, also landed j
on the second-string team.
Captain Norm Manoogian landed j
on the third string.
Hon Cook, Matt Armitage, and
Ted Tanner also received over 10 j
points in the complicated voting 1
system to rate Honorable Mention.
Notre Dame's all-purpose half- !
back John Lattner proced that pub- ,
licity pays by garnering the heavi- !
est support from the voters. Latt- j
ner made fewer yards rushing this
year than Ron Cook, although it
must be admitted that he was out
standing on runbacks and defense. !
Second in the balloting was Min
nesota's Paul Giel, who carried the
ball more times in his college ca
reer than any other back in modern j
history.
Third in the voting was UCLA's
poker-faced tailback Paul Cameron, i
Cameron is a tricky runner who I
could gain only when he had to.
The departure of Ike Jones and '
(J-lt. 6-in. Ernie Stockert showed
up Cameron's lack ol passing ability I
this year.
Fourth in the balloting was Il
linois' J. C. Caroline, who broke ■
multitudinous rushing records
and whose flashy broken - field
running upended Stanford in an
early-season tilt.
These four lads were good backs,
but it is hard to believe that they
were good enough to beat Garrett, |
who wa.s filth in the balloting.
The Daily strings along with Tom
Harmon, former All-American him- j
sell and now a Southern California |
sportscaster. He said, "Any team
that leaves off Garrett is a farce. He 1
is the best college passer in 20 j
years."
As disheartening as tlw placing of
Garrett on second string was the !
omission of guard Phil Wilson from
any honor at all. Manoogian upon
learning ot his honor immediately 1
asked, "How about Phil?"
Being told that he received no
mention, Manoogian shook his head
and said, "That poor guy has been {
lobbed all year."
What is the answer? Apparently
it takes a combination of pre-season
build-up and a few good perform- i
ances in the early games. We was
robbed!
