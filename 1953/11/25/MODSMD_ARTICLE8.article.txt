# Resident Seeks Lost Curb Post
## 
### 
The Axe is back, but Mr. Neil's
post is still missing.
J. P. Neil of l. p >fs7 College Avenue
in College Terrace once had a con
crete post at the curb in front of
his house. It was about a foot high
and on it was his street number,
in green Scotch-lite numerals.
Two eight - inch spikes protruding
from the bottom were moored in
concrete below (he ground.
Last Tuesday evening someone
worked the post loose from its base
and made off with it.
II anyone on the campus happens
to have the post, Mr. Neil would
like to get it back, with no ques
tions asked. As he pointed out, the
post is not much good to anyone
but himself.
Whoever has the post may leave
it under a tree and give Mr. Neil
an anonymous phone call at DA
5-1568.
