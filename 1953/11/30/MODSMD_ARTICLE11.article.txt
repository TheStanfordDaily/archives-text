# Political Union Will Hold Business Meeting Tonight
## 
### BARBARA TUERK Associate, Editor, The Daily 
The members of the Stanford Political Union will hold a busi
ness meeting tonight at 8 p.m. in Cubberley Auditorium.
On the agenda for discussion are two proposed amendments to
the Union's by-laws and two proposed changes in the rules. The
amendments must be passed by a two-thirds vote of the members

present, and the by-laws
by a simple majority vote.
Alfred Bowers, president of the
California State Assembly, originally
scheduled as tonight's speaker, in
formed the Union Executive Board
last week that he would not be able
to appear tonight.
The amendments, if passed,
would lower from 25 to 15 per cent
the percentage of total member
ship necessary before a party
could have official status in the
Union.
One rules change would require a
division of the house following floor
debate in the Union.
The present provision calls for a
hand vote, which can be counted. A
division of the house is not counted.
Members attending the meeting may
get an idea of how the group stands,
but no official result can be tabu
lated.
The second proposed rules change
would lower from three to two the
number of specially recognized
speakers each party might name to
begin the floor debate.
The fifteen per cent amendments
were proposed to the Union Exec
utive Board about four weeks ago,
and have been under consideration
by the Board since then, Wayne
Fuller, president of the Union said
yesterday.
The proposal originated with Bill
Fundenberg, law student from
Crothcrs Hall and one of the mem
bers of the Union's first Planning
Committee, and Bob Mishell, Execu
tive Committee representative from
Men's Halls.
Mishell explained last night that
the proposed amendment is designed
to give all students a chance to ex
press their viewpoints in the Union.
He said that many students believe
that the Union should not be pri
marily an organization of strictly

political parties.
Fundenberg added he believed the
possibility of new parties would pro
vide pressure on the two major
parties to keep the Union from be
coming stagnant.
Opposition to the proposed
amendments has been expressed
in executive hoard meetings by
John Breier, member - at - large
from the Independents.
Students who argue against the
organization might prove unrealistic
and difficult to administer.
The rules changes were proposed
by the executive board.
Fuller said that the board favors
division of the house at the end of
a meeting instead of a hand vote,
because many* important speakers
might not care to risk the embar
rassment of defeat by a student de
bater.
lie also said that the new system
will end the charge of outside
publicity becoming confused and
indicating that Stanford as a whole
has taken some political stand.
Lowering the number of speakers
from three to two was suggested by
the board to allow more debating
time for students who were not
selected as official speakers by the
parties or the Independents.
Tentative plans for next Quarter
will also be revealed at the meeting,
Fuller said.

Crothcrs Hall and one of the mem
bers of the Union's first Planning
Committee, and Bob Mishell, Execu
tive Committee representative from
Men's Halls.
Mishell explained last night that
the proposed amendment is designed
to give all students a chance to ex
press their viewpoints in the Union.
He said that many students believe
that the Union should not be pri
marily an organization of strictly

political parties.
Fundenberg added he believed the
possibility of new parties would pro
vide pressure on the two major
parties to keep the Union from be
coming stagnant.
Opposition to the proposed
amendments has been expressed
in executive hoard meetings by
John Breier, member - at - large
from the Independents.
Students who argue against the
organization might prove unrealistic
and difficult to administer.
The rules changes were proposed
by the executive board.
Fuller said that the board favors
division of the house at the end of
a meeting instead of a hand vote,
because many* important speakers
might not care to risk the embar
rassment of defeat by a student de
bater.
lie also said that the new system
will end the charge of outside
publicity becoming confused and
indicating that Stanford as a whole
has taken some political stand.
Lowering the number of speakers
from three to two was suggested by
the board to allow more debating
time for students who were not
selected as official speakers by the
parties or the Independents.
Tentative plans for next Quarter
will also be revealed at the meeting,
Fuller said.

The members of the Stanford Political Union will hold a busi
ness meeting tonight at 8 p.m. in Cubberley Auditorium.
On the agenda for discussion are two proposed amendments to
the Union's by-laws and two proposed changes in the rules. The
amendments must be passed by a two-thirds vote of the members

present, and the by-laws
by a simple majority vote.
Alfred Bowers, president of the
California State Assembly, originally
scheduled as tonight's speaker, in
formed the Union Executive Board
last week that he would not be able
to appear tonight.
The amendments, if passed,
would lower from 25 to 15 per cent
the percentage of total member
ship necessary before a party
could have official status in the
Union.
One rules change would require a
division of the house following floor
debate in the Union.
The present provision calls for a
hand vote, which can be counted. A
division of the house is not counted.
Members attending the meeting may
get an idea of how the group stands,
but no official result can be tabu
lated.
The second proposed rules change
would lower from three to two the
number of specially recognized
speakers each party might name to
begin the floor debate.
The fifteen per cent amendments
were proposed to the Union Exec
utive Board about four weeks ago,
and have been under consideration
by the Board since then, Wayne
Fuller, president of the Union said
yesterday.
The proposal originated with Bill
Fundenberg, law student from
Crothcrs Hall and one of the mem
bers of the Union's first Planning
Committee, and Bob Mishell, Execu
tive Committee representative from
Men's Halls.
