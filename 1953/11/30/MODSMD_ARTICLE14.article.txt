(UP) —The Communists proposed
today that the Korean peace confer
ence epen Dec. 28 in New Delhi,

tral." but the United Nations imme
diately rejected any neutral role for
the Soviet.

sian participation in a role which
would not bind it to any agreements
reached by the two sides—the 17
Allied nations which fought in Ko
rea and North Korea and Red
! China.
American envoy Arthur H. Dean

conference to active participants in
the war, would agree to invite the
other four "neutrals" whom the
Reds want to attend.
They include India, Indonesia,
Pakistan, and Burma.
The Red proposal also held out
the possibility of secret negotiations.
It asked the U.N. to agree that "no
communique or news release shall
be issued about any meeting of a
secret nature" exccpt by agreement
of the two sides.
The Communist proposal was in
response to Dean's 12-point plan of
fered Saturday in which neutral
nations would be admitted to the
parley as "non - voting observers"
strictly limited in their right to par
ticipate in the debates.
