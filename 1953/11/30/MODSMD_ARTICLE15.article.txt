STOCKHOLM, Nov. 29 (UP)—Ho
Chi-Minh, leader of the Communist
Viet Minh rebels, set his price for
an armistice- today in a broad hint
to France that he might be ready to
settle the war in Indochina.
Ho said he must have "real inde
pendence" for Viet Nam, and
"Fren«h colonialists" must cease
their incitement to hostilities if
there was to be a truce and even
tual peace.
He put the entire blame for eight

years of fighting in Indochina on
France. But he sidestepped ques
tions regarding a possible peace con
ference.
