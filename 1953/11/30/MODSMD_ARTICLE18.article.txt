### 
FORT WORTH, Tex., Nov. 29
(UP) â€”U.S. Secretary of Agricul
ture Ezra T. Benson tonight called
the cut in cotton acreage "drastic,
too severe," and reaffirmed he will
ask Congress to pass modifying leg
islation.
Benson's promise was given in a
transcribed radio interview on the
Republican State Executive Com
mittee's weekly "Report to Texas."
"Under present legislation," Ben
son said, "the Secretary of Agricul
ture is pretty much bound by law
as to what he should do in declar
ing acreage allotments on cotton.
"However, it is my feeling that
under the existing legislation the
cut in acreage allotment on cotton
required by the law is very drastic;
I am going to recommend strongly
to the Congress when it convenes
that there be some modification in
the law to ease that adjustment.''
