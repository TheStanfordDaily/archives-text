# Stanford Climber Dies In Fall on Mt. Shasta
## 
### 
Stanford graduate student Edgar Werner Hopf died Saturd
morning on an icy crag near the summit of Mt. Shasta from sevc.
head injuries suffered in an 800-foot fall down the sheer slope,
of that 14,162-foot Northern California peak.
His body was removed from the lofty crag early yesterday mor j

ing by members of the U.S. Forest'
Service and was taken, after a diffi
cult, eight-hour descent, to a chapel
in the town of Mt. Shasta. Funeral
arrangements are pending there.
Hopf was a member of a 17-mem
ber party from the Stanford Alpine
Club.
Other members of the party were
expected to return to campus last
night. The Mt. Shasta trek, an an-

nual Alpine Club affair, was headed
this year by Jon Lindbergh, son of
the famous aviator.
Lindbergh, when contacted I>y
The Daily in Mt. Shasta yesterday,
gave this account of the tragedy:
"About Saturday morning
about 12 of our party started out
from our base at Horse Camp,
which is about 8,000 feet high, and
headed for the summit, about 6,000
feet higher.
"Hopf, who had the reputation of
being an expert mountain climber
and skier, struck off by himself and
went ahead of the group.
"About 6:30 that morning the main
part of the group trying to scale the
mountain reached a rough ledge,
called Lake St. Helen, located about
3,000 feet above Horse Camp. Three
of our party were told to remain at
this point because of inexperience.
"The climbing conditions were
rough. The snow was frozen hard,
making it difficult to get a foothold.
"By seven we had been able to
climb about 500 feet further on. We
stopped to discuss whether we should
continue because the ice conditions
were becoming worse.
"Suddenly we saw Ilopf, falling,
spinning through the snow.
"He came down spinning.
"Some of us tried to stop him,
but it was futile.
"He must have been unconscious
when we saw him. There was a
streak of blood all the way down."
Lindbergh continued the grim
story:
"We rushed to him. He was bleed
ing profusely from the forehead, but
after awhile we were able to stop
the flow.
"One of our members, Sandy Cole,
was sent down the mountain to re
port the accident.
"Slipping and sliding down the
steep mountain side, Cole headed
for Horse Camp where he told mem
bers of our group who hadn't at
tempted the climb. They, I guess,
relayed word on to the forest rang
ers.
"We hied to carry Ilopf's body
down the bill, but we couldn't do
it. The ice was too slick.
"It took us a couple of hours to
reach Lake St. Helen with Hopf. We
couldn't go any further.
"In an attempt to keep Hopf as
warm as possible in the 20 degrees
above zero weather, we dressed him
in some of our clothes which we
shed.
"We also built a wind break and
eventually an igloo. We were
afraid to make the 3,000-foot de
scent to our base at Horse Camp
because it was obvious that move
ment was bard on Hopf—he al
most stopped breathing several
times on our short but difficult
climb down to Lake St. Helen.
Also wc were afraid of a storm.
"We decided to spend the night at
Lake St. Heicn.
"Hopf stopped breathing shortly
after we got him to the so-called
lake. We tried artificial respiration,

working more than ten hours, but 1-j
no avail.
"At about 11 Saturday night, a
plane flew over and dropped flare
(The plane, from the Coast Guar I
Station in South San Francisco, a ,<>
dropped blood plasma besides th
flares. Lindbergh said his part;,
never found the plasma. The plane
had been called by the Forest Serv
ice).
"The Forest Rangers arrived about
8 the next morning with a tobog
gan."
According to Lindbergh, Hopf
must have been at about 12,200
feet when he fell. He was wearing
skis at the time, witnesses report.
Rangers in the little mountain
community of Mt. Shasta were told
of the accident by Fred Firestone,
member of the Stanford group, who
first heard of Hopf's fall from Col' ,
who had raced from Lake St. Helen
to Horse Camp.
Firestone, when contacted yes
terday, said he and a friend from
the Sierra Ski Club donned skis
and headed for a place called Sand
Flat where the cars had been left.
From there, they said, they went t<>
Mt. Shasta where they tried to get
a doctor.
"Not being able to get one," Fire
stone said, "we got some medical
equipment and hiked back to Horse
Camp where we hoped to find Hopf.
"When we got back to the camp
and found that Hopf still lay about
3,000 feet above, we raced back to
town to the ranger station, where
they organized a ground party."
A ranger described the region
in which Ilopf fell as being "sleep,
almost straight up and down."
Lindbergh said that usually II n
climb to the summit of Mt. Shasta
not a dangerous one and is relati • ■
ly easy for those conditioned for
mountain hiking.
Hopf, who is a part-time stu
dent here, taking a course in elec
trical engineering, was employed
by the Stanford Research Insti
tute as a research engineer. He
was conducting experiments in
color television film technique .
A native of Switzerland, he wa
hired by the SRI in spring, 1951. If'
enrolled for his first course at the
University last spring but wa
forced to drop out becausc of hi
research work.
He re-registered this quarter.
He is survived by his wife, Mari
bel, whom he married in Spain is
1951, and by his mother, Ella Hopf
of Switzerland.
Other Stanford students in tin
party were:
Peggy Figg-Hoblyn, Donald Fa
villc, Vlado Kovalik, Peter Holt:
Joy Johnson, Carol Rudnick, Ell'-i
Ho ad ley, Robert Rhodes, P., u
Meyer, Sandy Cole, Ann Con tanl
Gail Gilbergh, Ellen Searby, an
Clair Vedensky.
