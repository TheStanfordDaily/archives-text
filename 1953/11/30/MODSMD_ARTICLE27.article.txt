# No Third Parties... Yet
## 
### 
The Political Un'on meeting tonight will be
a "business meeting" only.
At first that may sound a little dry.
But potentially tonight's meeting could de
velop into one of the Union's most important
and most heated debates of the year.
The question at hand is: Should membership
requirements for the Union's parties be low
ered to 15 per cent of the totcu Union member
ship?
This raises the issue:
Should the Union, fot this year, be composed
of two parties, republicans and Democrats,
with an independent party for students who
have not yet picked their political camp?
Or should the Union open the door to a multi
party organization?
In the long run, we probably favor a Union
with three or more parties. Some day students
may want to champion a political stand which
is essentially different from that of the Union
Republicans or the Union Democrats, and will
be justified in demanding representation in.the
Union. '
We'd even go out on a limb and suggest that
eventually a Socialist party might liven up
Union debate and provide a valuable educa
tional function in showing us just where these
mythical ogres really do stand on specific
issues.
But so far, nu such party has been heard from.
And so far, we believe the Union members
would be making a big mistake to pass the sug
gested 15 per cent amendment.
In the first place, to be very practical, the
amendment might prove impossible to ad
minister. A sub-provision calls for dropping
a party from official status if it drops below
15 per cent. With 150-odd members of the
Union free to shift parties at-will, it's easy
to see situations where no one knew which
parties had 15 per cent of the total member
ship and which only thought they had.

In the second place, the amendment would
undoubtedly weaken the existing parties. The
Union is new, only one meeting old, and nei
ther the Democrats nor the Republicans are
really on their feet.
To encourage new parties now might divide
Union membership into so many tiny sections
that no party could carry on an effective edu
cational policy. Let's get two strong parties
lirst, and then start dividing on subtler ques
tions of policy.
In the third place, the amendment would
encourage an essentially unrealistic Union.
In the real political world a voter must work
within the Republican or the Democratic
party to try to make that party reflect his
opinions, or he must remain independent,
and try to perform the function of critic for
the two major parties.
Both those alternatives are available in the
present Union. The Republicans and the Demo
crats are new parties, welcoming help and
ideas from any interested students. And the
one-third of the Union members who are now
Independents seem to be a strong and en
thusiastic group, very well aware of their criti
cal responsibility.
In the real political world voters can't go
out and form new parties if they find them
selves on the minority end of a vote, or if they
decide they prefer the name "Liberal"' to the
name "Democrat," or the name "Conservative"
to the name "Republican."
Some day, yes. Some day, we'll need three
or four parties in the Union. Some day, we'll
want to express political viewpoints in the
Union that are not being expressed by the
Union Republicans or the Union Democrats.
But right now let's get the parties we have on
their feet before we start experimenting with
new parties to express the same political phil
osophies.
