# PRIVATE LIFE

### LARRY CAHN 
In order to give you .-.n idea of what each soldier
must go through for his eight or 16 weeks of basic
training, I am going to give you a run-down of a
typical day.
The day begins any time between ?• n.m. to 5 a.m.,

depending upon the mood of the
sergeant and the amount of work
that must be done before break
fast.
The first formation is usually
about 5:15 a.m. and is held in
front of each barrack::. Breakfast
follows, and it is a substantial
one. No talking is mitted in
the mess hall. . ~;es for all
meals, with the penalty being
eating while standing, or, some-

thing more severe, being marched from the hall and
made to eat in the street.
Following breakfast it's back to the barracks and
final clean-up before you are ofT for the field.
The next formation is between (5:30 and 7 a.m. For
this one you have your rifle, field pack, and whatever
else may be required.
During your march to youi day's destination,
time out is taken for phy.v si training, fondly
called P.T. by the troops. It's 111 odd minutes of ex
ercise* or your "daily dozen," climaxed by five
minutes of running.
Then you're off a nin, When you reach your in
struction course, you lile into open air bleachers
and are taught your Army lessons for the day,
whether it be use of the rifle, first aid, sanitation,
hand-to-hancl combat, or any of the many training
phases.

The remainder of the day is spent in putting to
use what you have learned. And you learn when
instructors keep reminding yoja that what you learn
here may someday save your life.
When you're in the field for the entire day, lunch
is rolled out in chow wagons and you eat from mess
kits which must be thoroughly cleaned to prevent
intestinal upset.
When you head back to your company whatever
sun there was is long gone, and the march back is
usually mostly all double time.
The only thing you have time to do when you get
back is put your riflle in its rack, then it's chow.
You've finished supper between 6:.'10 and 7, and
you return to the barracks to clean your rifle so that
white-gloved inspectors can find no dust, polish
your boots to a mirror-like surface, scrub down the
barracks, arrange foot and wall lockers and get in
order other details for the always inevitable, threat
ening inspections.
And about 11 p.m. you're in bed for your four to
sfx hours sleep, uninterrupted too, if all have been
good; and if not, you may be gotten up at anytime
and any number of times in a single night.
What about mail call? That's your leader's choice
and is a powerful weapon in keeping the men in line.
That's a typical basic training day. We have st> of
them straight, just about a quarter's worth of classes
and finals at Stanford. There's one big difference
though. Professors don't stress that you students are
being made "professional killers." Our instructors do
just that.
It makes you wonder what kind of a world we are
living in.

your boots to a mirror-like surface, scrub down the
barracks, arrange foot and wall lockers and get in
order other details for the always inevitable, threat
ening inspections.
And about 11 p.m. you're in bed for your four to
sfx hours sleep, uninterrupted too, if all have been
good; and if not, you may be gotten up at anytime
and any number of times in a single night.
What about mail call? That's your leader's choice
and is a powerful weapon in keeping the men in line.
That's a typical basic training day. We have st> of
them straight, just about a quarter's worth of classes
and finals at Stanford. There's one big difference
though. Professors don't stress that you students are
being made "professional killers." Our instructors do
just that.
It makes you wonder what kind of a world we are
living in.

In order to give you .-.n idea of what each soldier
must go through for his eight or 16 weeks of basic
training, I am going to give you a run-down of a
typical day.
The day begins any time between ?• n.m. to 5 a.m.,

depending upon the mood of the
sergeant and the amount of work
that must be done before break
fast.
The first formation is usually
about 5:15 a.m. and is held in
front of each barrack::. Breakfast
follows, and it is a substantial
one. No talking is mitted in
the mess hall. . ~;es for all
meals, with the penalty being
eating while standing, or, some-

thing more severe, being marched from the hall and
made to eat in the street.
Following breakfast it's back to the barracks and
final clean-up before you are ofT for the field.
The next formation is between (5:30 and 7 a.m. For
this one you have your rifle, field pack, and whatever
else may be required.
During your march to youi day's destination,
time out is taken for phy.v si training, fondly
called P.T. by the troops. It's 111 odd minutes of ex
ercise* or your "daily dozen," climaxed by five
minutes of running.
Then you're off a nin, When you reach your in
struction course, you lile into open air bleachers
and are taught your Army lessons for the day,
whether it be use of the rifle, first aid, sanitation,
hand-to-hancl combat, or any of the many training
phases.

The remainder of the day is spent in putting to
use what you have learned. And you learn when
instructors keep reminding yoja that what you learn
here may someday save your life.
When you're in the field for the entire day, lunch
is rolled out in chow wagons and you eat from mess
kits which must be thoroughly cleaned to prevent
intestinal upset.
When you head back to your company whatever
sun there was is long gone, and the march back is
usually mostly all double time.
The only thing you have time to do when you get
back is put your riflle in its rack, then it's chow.
You've finished supper between 6:.'10 and 7, and
you return to the barracks to clean your rifle so that
white-gloved inspectors can find no dust, polish
your boots to a mirror-like surface, scrub down the
barracks, arrange foot and wall lockers and get in
order other details for the always inevitable, threat
ening inspections.
And about 11 p.m. you're in bed for your four to
