# Stanford Cagers Will Face A Stronger PCC: Burnett
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
The 1953 54 edition of the
Stanford basketball team will
open its season tomorrow night
with definite prospects of im
proving on last year's seven
won and 20 lost record.
Whether this improvement has

been enough to move the Indians
into the Pacific Coast Conference
championship picture is the big
question mark about Bob Burnett's
cagers this year.
The Indians will be fielding a vet
eran team, having lost but one man
from last year's starting five. That
was captain George Zaninovich.
The other loss was reserve Paul
Johnson.
Boosting the Cards' stock is the
fact that they have acquired sev
eral promising junior college trans
fers, and have the nucleus from a
frosh team that compiled an im
pressive won and lost record.
Coach Burnett summed up the
team's prospects for the year when
he said:
"The Pacific Coast Conference
this year ih the strongest that I
have known since I came to Stan
ford.
"California must be regarded as
one of the West's best teams, with
McKeen, Matheny, and Albo, plus
other capable players. The Bears
should be very tough indeed.
"UCLA will also be a potent fac
tor this season, since they didn't
lose a single starting player from
last year's team. They must be rat
ed in my book as the co-favorites
with California for the Southern
Division title.
"USC does not detract from the
picture, even though they lost
Flower and Simpson. They had
what was probably the finest fresh
man team in California last year,
and have acquired several tall jun- |
ior college players.
"Stanford is the question mark.
Do we have the height ancl the abil
ity to compete favorably with the
other teams? We hope that our De
cember games will give us the nec- I
essary experience by the time con
ference season opens.
"However, I am sure that we are
going to win some conference
games. I don't know whom we are
going to beat or how many we'll
take, but mark my word, we'll
sneak up on some of the big boys."
The "Big Man" in Burnett's
plans for this season is Ron Toin
»ic, a 5-11 junior who is current
ly rewriting the Stanford basket
ball record book.
Ron, who hails from Oakland,
has been a starter for Burnett
ever since he was a freshman, and
in two seasons of competition
lias poured 83fi points through the
hoop. Last season he scored 515
points to eclipse Hank Luisetti's
one - year scoring record by 5(1
points. Ron averaged over 1!)
points a game.
Among Tomsk's outstanding in
dividual efforts last year was a 39-
point splurge against Bradley to es
tablish a new individual one-game
scoring record for the San Fran
cisco Cow Palace, and a 38-point
outburst against USC which tied the
Southern Division individual one
game point standard.
Making up the rest of the Cards'
probable starting team will be Don
DeLong at the other forward, Russ
Lawler at center, and Oleg Suzda
leff and George Selleck at guard.
DeLong, a 6-ft. 2-in. senior from
San Francisco, showed considerable
improvement as last season pro
gressed and is considered to be one
ol the Cards' most consistent court
performers.
Standing 6 ft. 6V2 in., Lawler is
the tallest man on the squad. A
junior from Salinas, Russ also im
proved rapidly last season.

Suzdaleff will be marking his
third season as a starter for the In
dians. A 5-ft. 11 - in. senior from
San Francisco, Olie was the second
leading scorer for the Cards last
season, averaging nearly nine points
a game. He is an outstanding ball
handler and floor man, as well as
possessing a fine outside shot. Bur
nett feels that Suzdaleff, as the vet
eran of the team, should have one
of his finest seasons.
The only sophomore to break
into the starting live is Selleck.
Although only 5 ft. 8 in. and
weighing 145 lb., Selleck, whose
home is Coinjiton, was the lead
ing scorer on last year's freshman
team which lost only one game.
Besides averaging 17 points a
game for the frosh, George was a
superb ball handler and passer as
well as possessing a deadly set shot
Also sure to see plenty of action
for the Indian cagers this season are
reserves Dave Epperson, Jim John
son, Ron Wagner, Barry Brown, Bill
Turner, Leo Schweiger, and Carlos
Bea.
Epperson, a 6-ft. 5-in. senior, was
hampered by illness last season, but
now in good health he should profit
by his shift to forward in 1954.
Johnson, a junior, was also a
leading reserve last year. Wagner
was captain of last season's frosh
team.
The remainder 'are transfers.

have known since I came to Stan
ford.
"California must be regarded as
one of the West's best teams, with
McKeen, Matheny, and Albo, plus
other capable players. The Bears
should be very tough indeed.
"UCLA will also be a potent fac
tor this season, since they didn't
lose a single starting player from
last year's team. They must be rat
ed in my book as the co-favorites
with California for the Southern
Division title.
"USC does not detract from the
picture, even though they lost
Flower and Simpson. They had
what was probably the finest fresh
man team in California last year,
and have acquired several tall jun- |
ior college players.
"Stanford is the question mark.
Do we have the height ancl the abil
ity to compete favorably with the
other teams? We hope that our De
cember games will give us the nec- I
essary experience by the time con
ference season opens.
"However, I am sure that we are
going to win some conference
games. I don't know whom we are
going to beat or how many we'll
take, but mark my word, we'll
sneak up on some of the big boys."
The "Big Man" in Burnett's
plans for this season is Ron Toin
»ic, a 5-11 junior who is current
ly rewriting the Stanford basket
ball record book.
Ron, who hails from Oakland,
has been a starter for Burnett
ever since he was a freshman, and
in two seasons of competition
lias poured 83fi points through the
hoop. Last season he scored 515
points to eclipse Hank Luisetti's
one - year scoring record by 5(1
points. Ron averaged over 1!)
points a game.
Among Tomsk's outstanding in
dividual efforts last year was a 39-
point splurge against Bradley to es
tablish a new individual one-game
scoring record for the San Fran
cisco Cow Palace, and a 38-point
outburst against USC which tied the
Southern Division individual one
game point standard.
Making up the rest of the Cards'
probable starting team will be Don
DeLong at the other forward, Russ
Lawler at center, and Oleg Suzda
leff and George Selleck at guard.
DeLong, a 6-ft. 2-in. senior from
San Francisco, showed considerable
improvement as last season pro
gressed and is considered to be one
ol the Cards' most consistent court
performers.
Standing 6 ft. 6V2 in., Lawler is
the tallest man on the squad. A
junior from Salinas, Russ also im
proved rapidly last season.

Suzdaleff will be marking his
third season as a starter for the In
dians. A 5-ft. 11 - in. senior from
San Francisco, Olie was the second
leading scorer for the Cards last
season, averaging nearly nine points
a game. He is an outstanding ball
handler and floor man, as well as
possessing a fine outside shot. Bur
nett feels that Suzdaleff, as the vet
eran of the team, should have one
of his finest seasons.
The only sophomore to break
into the starting live is Selleck.
Although only 5 ft. 8 in. and
weighing 145 lb., Selleck, whose
home is Coinjiton, was the lead
ing scorer on last year's freshman
team which lost only one game.
Besides averaging 17 points a
game for the frosh, George was a
superb ball handler and passer as
well as possessing a deadly set shot
Also sure to see plenty of action
for the Indian cagers this season are
reserves Dave Epperson, Jim John
son, Ron Wagner, Barry Brown, Bill
Turner, Leo Schweiger, and Carlos
Bea.
Epperson, a 6-ft. 5-in. senior, was
hampered by illness last season, but
now in good health he should profit
by his shift to forward in 1954.
Johnson, a junior, was also a
leading reserve last year. Wagner
was captain of last season's frosh
team.
The remainder 'are transfers.


HON TOMSIC
—The records are being rewritten
The 1953 54 edition of the
Stanford basketball team will
open its season tomorrow night
with definite prospects of im
proving on last year's seven
won and 20 lost record.
Whether this improvement has

been enough to move the Indians
into the Pacific Coast Conference
championship picture is the big
question mark about Bob Burnett's
cagers this year.
The Indians will be fielding a vet
eran team, having lost but one man
from last year's starting five. That
was captain George Zaninovich.
The other loss was reserve Paul
Johnson.
Boosting the Cards' stock is the
fact that they have acquired sev
eral promising junior college trans
fers, and have the nucleus from a
frosh team that compiled an im
pressive won and lost record.

"However, I am sure that we are
going to win some conference
games. I don't know whom we are
going to beat or how many we'll
take, but mark my word, we'll
sneak up on some of the big boys."
The "Big Man" in Burnett's
plans for this season is Ron Toin
»ic, a 5-11 junior who is current
ly rewriting the Stanford basket
ball record book.
Ron, who hails from Oakland,
has been a starter for Burnett
ever since he was a freshman, and
in two seasons of competition
lias poured 83fi points through the
hoop. Last season he scored 515
points to eclipse Hank Luisetti's
one - year scoring record by 5(1
points. Ron averaged over 1!)
points a game.
Among Tomsk's outstanding in
dividual efforts last year was a 39-
point splurge against Bradley to es
tablish a new individual one-game
scoring record for the San Fran
cisco Cow Palace, and a 38-point
outburst against USC which tied the
Southern Division individual one
game point standard.
Making up the rest of the Cards'
probable starting team will be Don
DeLong at the other forward, Russ
Lawler at center, and Oleg Suzda
leff and George Selleck at guard.
DeLong, a 6-ft. 2-in. senior from
San Francisco, showed considerable
improvement as last season pro
gressed and is considered to be one
ol the Cards' most consistent court
performers.
Standing 6 ft. 6V2 in., Lawler is
the tallest man on the squad. A
junior from Salinas, Russ also im
proved rapidly last season.

Suzdaleff will be marking his
third season as a starter for the In
dians. A 5-ft. 11 - in. senior from
San Francisco, Olie was the second
leading scorer for the Cards last
season, averaging nearly nine points
a game. He is an outstanding ball
handler and floor man, as well as
possessing a fine outside shot. Bur
nett feels that Suzdaleff, as the vet
eran of the team, should have one
of his finest seasons.
The only sophomore to break
into the starting live is Selleck.
Although only 5 ft. 8 in. and
weighing 145 lb., Selleck, whose
home is Coinjiton, was the lead
ing scorer on last year's freshman
team which lost only one game.
Besides averaging 17 points a
game for the frosh, George was a
superb ball handler and passer as
well as possessing a deadly set shot
Also sure to see plenty of action
for the Indian cagers this season are
reserves Dave Epperson, Jim John
son, Ron Wagner, Barry Brown, Bill
Turner, Leo Schweiger, and Carlos
Bea.
Epperson, a 6-ft. 5-in. senior, was
hampered by illness last season, but
now in good health he should profit
by his shift to forward in 1954.
Johnson, a junior, was also a
leading reserve last year. Wagner
was captain of last season's frosh
team.
The remainder 'are transfers.


HON TOMSIC
—The records are being rewritten
The 1953 54 edition of the
Stanford basketball team will
open its season tomorrow night
with definite prospects of im
proving on last year's seven
won and 20 lost record.
Whether this improvement has

been enough to move the Indians
into the Pacific Coast Conference
championship picture is the big
question mark about Bob Burnett's
cagers this year.
The Indians will be fielding a vet
eran team, having lost but one man
from last year's starting five. That
was captain George Zaninovich.
The other loss was reserve Paul
Johnson.
Boosting the Cards' stock is the
fact that they have acquired sev
eral promising junior college trans
fers, and have the nucleus from a
frosh team that compiled an im
pressive won and lost record.
Coach Burnett summed up the
team's prospects for the year when
he said:
"The Pacific Coast Conference
this year ih the strongest that I
have known since I came to Stan
ford.
"California must be regarded as
one of the West's best teams, with
McKeen, Matheny, and Albo, plus
other capable players. The Bears
should be very tough indeed.
"UCLA will also be a potent fac
tor this season, since they didn't
lose a single starting player from
last year's team. They must be rat
ed in my book as the co-favorites
with California for the Southern
Division title.
"USC does not detract from the
picture, even though they lost
Flower and Simpson. They had
what was probably the finest fresh
man team in California last year,
and have acquired several tall jun- |
ior college players.
"Stanford is the question mark.
Do we have the height ancl the abil
ity to compete favorably with the
other teams? We hope that our De
cember games will give us the nec- I
essary experience by the time con
ference season opens.
