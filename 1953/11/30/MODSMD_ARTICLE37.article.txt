# Peerless Pickers Are All Through
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily annual foot
ball prognostication gonfalon ended
in a blaze of disaster, as "King
Football" hung up his crown for
another season with one of the most
turbulent weekends of the current
year.
Don Stephens, who won the prog
nostication crown with a 41-15-4
mark, was lucky to add a 3-5-2
weekend mark to his total. How
ever, all the peerless ones suffered
a similar fate as the Big Game
ended in a tie, Washington State
and Oregon State upset their cross
state university counterparts, the
Universities of Washington and Or
egon, and Michigan dumped Ohio
State.
Stephens' award for the crown?
Probably an all-expense vacation at
Bellevue.
Season's marks: Head Uoacn iay
lor. 31-25-4; Dean Winbigler, 38-
18-4: captain Manoogian. 39-17-4:
and Daily sportswriters Stephens,
41-14.-4; Johnson, 40â€”1G-4; Hudson,
36-20-4; and Berman, 38-18-4.
