# Hooters Beat Santa Clara
## 
### 
The Stanford soccer team
moved to an easy 3 to 1 victory
over Santa Clara on the Stan
ford soccer field last Wednes
day afternoon.
The win put the Indians in a pn- j
sition of being able to tie for the i
California Intercollegiate Soc c e r
Association title if they can knock
over mighty University of San
Francisco next Saturday.
The Dons have compiled a fantas
tic record of 55 games without a de
feat in league competition.
But Coach Leo Wein tein's men
feel they can do the job if they per
form as they have in winning then
last three games. In last year's
linale, the Cards held the Dons to
a 1 to 1 tie.
In last Wednesday's game, the In
dians dominated the tilt completely,
and it was only through the tre
mendous efforts of the Santa Clara
goalie that Stanford scored no more
than three goals.
A loose ball, last touched by In
dian right inside Per Ditlev Simen
so'n, gave the Indians a 1 to 0 half
time lead.
Center forward Bill Wren and left
inside Sam Suarez added two more
in the third quarter.
Santa Clara scored their only goal
in the fourth quarter off yoalie Fred
Frye, who had replaced the injured
Kerf Woods.
