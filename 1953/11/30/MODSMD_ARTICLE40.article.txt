# BROWNS CINCH TITLE
## 
### 
The undefeated Cleveland Browns i
virtually cinched the National Foot- J
ball League's Eastern Conference
title Sunday for the fourth time in
as many tries by defeating the Chi
cago Cardinals, 27-IG, and the idle
Detroit Lions boosted their Western
Conference lead to a full game
without collecting a bruise.
The Cardinals led, 14-10, going
into the final period at Cleveland. It
looked as though they would crack
Cleveland's perfect record but a 30-
yard field goal by Lou Groza, an
eight-yard touchdown dash by half
back Ray Renfro. and a 37 - yard
scoring run by defensive halfback
Tommy James enabled Cleveland to
clinch the division crown.
