# Danish Graduate Student Is Soccer-Playing Scholar

(This is the second in a series
of nine articles on Stanford's For
eign Scholars.)

While Garrett & Co. gathered
laurels on the gridiron, another
high - ranking Stanford sports
squad went practically unno
ticed. This Card outfit was the
soccer team, and one of its out-!
standing members was Niels
Vinding, 25 - year - old foreign !
scholar from Denmark.
Niels, handsome, Alan Ladd type,
is taking graduate courses in busi
ness and will return next year to
the University of Copenhagen to
finish his studies. Although a skilled
athlete and winner of a gold medal
in Denmark, Neils' first love is ad- j
vertising, which he will enter full- :
time after graduation from Copen- :
hagen.
There are no great differences J
between advertising in the two
countries, be spid. "Except that in
America advertisers say 'So-and- j
so cigarettes are so mild and i
tasty,' and you buy them.'' But the I
Dane i-> from Missouri "and lias
to know bow are Kools cool' and j
why do 'Luckics taste better'
(than what?)."
As a student of the public's reac
tion to campaign speeches, propa
ganda, and the like, Niels has this
to say about an American institu
tion: "McCarthy is about the great
est ally the Communists have. He's
done more to promote Communism
and anti-Americanism than the Ro- I
senbergs, Hisses, et al., rolled into
one. It's unbelievable the damage
he has done."
Danes, as well as most Europeans,
find it hard to fret over Commu
nism. he said. "Neither do we j
worry about war as much as you
Americans do. You realize that for
the first time your country may be
come a battleground where the
folks back home will be worse off
than the soldiers at the front, where
cities will be blown off the map
and helpless people killed. Europe's j
been in the middle of war for cen
turies, so it's nothing new to us."
Personally Niels thinks there will
be no war so long as the West re
mains stronger than Russia.
Another American who has
made a negative impression on
Denmark is Danny Kaye, hero of i
Hans Christian Andersen." His
attempts to further immortalize
their countryman went unappre
ciated among the Danes.
Another favorite study of Niels
is international relations. While in
Denmark he worked with the Scan
dinavian Student Travel Service, a
non-profit organization to promote
goodwill by assisting American stu- i
dents on tours of Europe. Next term
he plans to continue his work '
through the Stanford Institute of j
International Relations.
Neils wishes he could contribute |
to the lists of impressions of the
U.S. which foreign students have i
drawn up. "But life here is so much

like my native Denmark and the
people are so friendly I hardly feel
I'm in a foreign country."
Perhaps the main difference is the
campus life. Danish schools have'

very little. Partly because of their
many activities, their training and
their distance from the trouble
zones, Americans generally arc not
as concerned with world affairs as
Europeans are, Niels said.
"At least temporarily, the Big
Game game between Stanford and
the world."
