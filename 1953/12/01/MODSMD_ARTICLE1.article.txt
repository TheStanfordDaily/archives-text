## Wert Tells Encina Frosh About Expansion Program 
### DAVE BROWNWOOD 
"Stanford is going into the real estate busi
ness," according to Robert J. Wert, assistant to
University President J. E. Wallace Sterling.
Wert spoke with a large group of freshmen
last night in the Encina lounge. Steve Horn was

moderator.
"Big changes are planned some
time in the next year or two," said
Wert in Jiis talk regarding Univer
sity building and land development
plans.
Pointing out the inadequacy of |
present dormitory space ("only 50
per cent of the students now live on
campus"), student union facilities,
and buildings for both academics
and administration, Wert told how
plans are currently under way to
alleviate these conditions.
"The problem in almost every
thing these days is mainly finan
cial," Wert explained.
To overcome this and to obtain j
additional money for the improve
ments under consideration, he con
tinued, plans are being made for
residential and commercial devel
opment of the (>,OOO acres of Stan
ford land that, in the opinion of
University officials, will never be
used as part of the campus.
Explaining a second reason for
the development program, Wert
said Stanford has "the only large
plot of land left in the Peninsula
area, and if we have some plans for
its development, various public
agencies would have less reason to
want to use the land for municipal
developments which might not be
to the best interests of the Univer
sity."
Some of the buildings now being
planned for the campus include a
700-unit dorm for frosh men, a 500-
unit women's dorm in the Knoll
area, the completion of Stern and
Crothers halls, the Trcsidder Me
morial Union — with a new book
store and post office—a new geo
physics laboratory, and a creative
arts quadrangle near Memorial Au
ditorium for speech, music, and art
students, Wert added.
