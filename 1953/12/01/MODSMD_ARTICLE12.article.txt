# Former Japanese Envoy Visits Here
## 
### HADLEY ROFF Editor, The Daily 
One of Japan's military and
diplomatic experts hinted
broadly here yesterday that the
United States was wrong in its
policy to disarm his country
after World War II and said that
it might take Japan "many
years" to build an adequate de
fense force.
Now retired and in this country
as a private citizen, Admiral Kichi
saburo Nomura, who was ambassa
dor to Washington at the time of
the Pearl Harbor attack, said in an
interview that he is "of the strong
opinion" that Japan must have its
own defense force.
In this, he said he was in com
plete agreement with Vice - Presi
dent Richard Nixon who, on a re
cent visit to the insular nation, said
he believed that America was mis
taken when it ordered Japan to dis- j
mantle its armed forces.
(After Japan's surrender in 1945, j
the U.S. instituted an occupation
policy that included the demobili
zation of the army atjd navy and
destruction of all weapons of war
and a constitutional ban against the
maintenance of any armed forcc.)
Arguing for a self - defense
force, (he 75-year-old admiral
said he thought, "We arc relying i
too much fin your country. Wc j
must rely on ourselves. Wc must
defend our own country."
It would take many years, he |
claimed, to build Japan's military !
strength to the point where it could j
adequately defend the island clus- 1

One of the drawbacks lo quick
militarization, even if such a course
were approved by the Japanese
government, is the lack of industry
properly geared to the manufacture
of modern war equipment, particu
larly aircraft, Nomura advised.
At present, lie said, most of the

citizenry are against rearmament.
Me said many persons felt (hat "if
we have sailors and soldiers, then
we will have war."
"In an election," he asserted,
"most of the electorate would
vote against rearmament."
He charged that the political par

ties in Japan attempt to appease and
not to educate the people about
what he termed the "need for an
adequate defense force."
"They won't cducatc them," he
said, with a discouraged shrug of
his shoulders.
When asked about the future of
| Korea, he said he didn't believe that
war would again flare in that area,
and then, in an aside, added, "but
you never know what can happen
in the Orient."
He said he hoped that Korea
eventually could lie unified as a
democratic and independent coun
try.
Nomura, who has twinkly, soft
brown eyes and an easy, exuberant
| chuckle, said this marked the first
j time he has visited this country
i since the outset of World War 11.
He said he came to visit "old
and good friends" who were in
the American Navy or diplomatic
corps when he served in Wash
| ington.
"I am grateful for their friendship
( and their faith in me," the admiral
I smiled.
The admiral has insisted that
while in Washington in 1941 he was
unaware of his country's intention
to bomb Pearl Harbor and touch off
I a world war.
He explained that he is now re
-1 tired from the navy and has no of
ficial position with the Japanese
government.
"I'm just a private citizen dedi
cated to my country," he de
clared.
Nomura, who plans to sail for
Japan next month, spent yesterday
morning with Dr. Harold Fisher and
other officials of Hoover Library.
He has been in this country for
i over a month.
