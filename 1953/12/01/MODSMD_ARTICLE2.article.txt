Unrestricted gifts of money are Stanford's
greatest financial need at present, according to
James Triolo, Associate General Secretary of the
University.
Where and how the University gets its finan-

cial support was explained at Roblc
last night by Triolo and David Ja
cobson, General Secretary, in an in
formal talk, a part of the '"Stanford
—Today and Tomorrow" series of
administration and faculty talks for
freshmcn.
They were introduced by Otis
Winters, member of the "Stanford
—Today and Tomorrow" Steering
Committee.
Gifts to the University come from
lour main sources- alumni, corpo
rations, bequests, and philanthropic
foundations, Jacobson said. Of the
$4 million given Stanford last year,
approximately $500,000 came from
corporations, $1 million from foun
dations, and the remainder from
alumni donations and bequests.
Only six per cent of the $4 million
is for unrestricted use. Most popu
lar designations are research and
student aid, he said.
Triolo explained that the net
budget needed to operate Stanford
each year is about $8 1 /2 million, of
which tuition pays around $4 mil
lion. The rest, he added, must comc
from gifts and land development
projects.
"Stanford has never asked under
graduates to contribute," Triolo
stated.
A project which will require
about $20 million in gifts is the
prospective shift of the Stanford
Medical School from San Francisco
to a spot near the bacteriology lab
oratory on campus. Two reasons for
the move are rapid population
growth in the Peninsula area and
the fact that, the first-year medical
school is already on campus, Jacob
son commented.
Stanford will attempt lo tap all
sources of money this year and will
he "pleasantly aggressive" in so
liciting it, Jacobson .said. If they
can average $5 million in gifts over
the next leu years, they'll be doing
about what they should. It's hard
to determine what the intake will
be, especially since income from
wills is very uncertain.
In answer to a question posed by
one of the students, Triolo stated
that gifts to any college or univer
sity are federal income tax deduc
l tible.
