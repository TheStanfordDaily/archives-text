Wiiy is Jess Hill still coaching at USC? Last Saturday's slaughter by
Notre Dame climaxed one of the most phenomenal records of miscoaching
ever seen on the Coast.
Consider the 1951 squad. That team won seven and lost three; one
of the three defeats coining at the hands of Stanford's Rose-Bowlers.
27-20.
Thifj Trojan team was led by four men who received first-string All—
America recognition: Pat Canamella, Frank GifTord, Elmer Willhoite, and
Jim Sears. Others on this team included 260-pound Charley Ane, now a
Detroit Lion regular; wingback Al Carmichael, now fir.st string lor Green
Jii-y; defensive flashes Jim Psaltis and John Williams, who now patrol the
Washington Redskins' defensive backfield; Riuly Bukich, who understudies
Norm Van Brocklin at Los Angeles; and Bob Van Doren, now with the
49t*rs. In addition the pros are awaiting the return of Bob Hooks from
the service.
The lull story will he written next spring when the pro draft will
undoubtedly grab up such behemoths as Ed Pucci, George Timhevlake,
l indon Crow, George Bozanic, and Tom Nickolott".
When Mel Hein moved in as line coach, the defense began to measure
up to the great talent of the squad, but Mr. Hill's turgid single wing
offense has never been anything but ludicrous.
Bukich was third-string tailback. Why not first-string quarterback?
Hill discovered his great arm in the second half of his final game, the
1953 Rose Bowl. Carmichael amassed onij' 345 yards rushing from his
wingback post. Now, as a T formation halfback, he is running wild for
Green Bay. GifTord, an outstanding runner and defensive back, hand
cuffed the Trojan attack through lack of passing ability.
We feel that the USC 1951 and 1952 teams represented the greatest
collection of material in seven years, or since the 1946-47 Notre Dame
quads, II Chuck Taylor or Pappy Waldorf had coached USC, the Trojans
would have been national champions two years in a row.

The next Olympics will be held in Melbourne in 1956. It will be held
in the summer, but summer comes to Australia in December. Does this
mean that the tryouts will be held in the middle of football season? It
does not, according to Brutus Hamilton, 1948 Olympic coach. Hamilton
ays the trials will be held in late summer and it will be up to the boys
to stay in shape through the fall. It will be tough on them, he admits, but
with an Olympic medal as a goal, he is sure the boys will make it.

The stature of Grantland Rice's Ail-American teams has been drop
ping steadily through the years, and this year it has reached new lows
as he picked a 22-man team. Mr. Rice accepted the title of official
picker when Walter Camp died in 1925, but Mr. Rice apparently is not
up to (he task of picking the top II men. We would recommend as offi
cial the team published yearly in the NCAA football guide, which is the
consensus choice of the major pickers.

Mel Allen asked Paul'Cameron on a recent TV show, "Who was the
best player you ever faced?"
"Garrett of Stanford."
Allen then asked Tom Harmon to name the greatest player he had
ever seen. Harmon replied, "Bob Garrett or Forest Evashevski." High
praise indeed for Mr. Garrett.

The next Olympics will be held in Melbourne in 1956. It will be held
in the summer, but summer comes to Australia in December. Does this
mean that the tryouts will be held in the middle of football season? It
does not, according to Brutus Hamilton, 1948 Olympic coach. Hamilton
ays the trials will be held in late summer and it will be up to the boys
to stay in shape through the fall. It will be tough on them, he admits, but
with an Olympic medal as a goal, he is sure the boys will make it.

The stature of Grantland Rice's Ail-American teams has been drop
ping steadily through the years, and this year it has reached new lows
as he picked a 22-man team. Mr. Rice accepted the title of official
picker when Walter Camp died in 1925, but Mr. Rice apparently is not
up to (he task of picking the top II men. We would recommend as offi
cial the team published yearly in the NCAA football guide, which is the
consensus choice of the major pickers.

Mel Allen asked Paul'Cameron on a recent TV show, "Who was the
best player you ever faced?"
"Garrett of Stanford."
Allen then asked Tom Harmon to name the greatest player he had
ever seen. Harmon replied, "Bob Garrett or Forest Evashevski." High
praise indeed for Mr. Garrett.
Wiiy is Jess Hill still coaching at USC? Last Saturday's slaughter by
Notre Dame climaxed one of the most phenomenal records of miscoaching
ever seen on the Coast.
Consider the 1951 squad. That team won seven and lost three; one
of the three defeats coining at the hands of Stanford's Rose-Bowlers.
27-20.
Thifj Trojan team was led by four men who received first-string All—
America recognition: Pat Canamella, Frank GifTord, Elmer Willhoite, and
Jim Sears. Others on this team included 260-pound Charley Ane, now a
Detroit Lion regular; wingback Al Carmichael, now fir.st string lor Green
Jii-y; defensive flashes Jim Psaltis and John Williams, who now patrol the
Washington Redskins' defensive backfield; Riuly Bukich, who understudies
Norm Van Brocklin at Los Angeles; and Bob Van Doren, now with the
49t*rs. In addition the pros are awaiting the return of Bob Hooks from
the service.
The lull story will he written next spring when the pro draft will
undoubtedly grab up such behemoths as Ed Pucci, George Timhevlake,
l indon Crow, George Bozanic, and Tom Nickolott".
When Mel Hein moved in as line coach, the defense began to measure
up to the great talent of the squad, but Mr. Hill's turgid single wing
offense has never been anything but ludicrous.
Bukich was third-string tailback. Why not first-string quarterback?
Hill discovered his great arm in the second half of his final game, the
1953 Rose Bowl. Carmichael amassed onij' 345 yards rushing from his
wingback post. Now, as a T formation halfback, he is running wild for
Green Bay. GifTord, an outstanding runner and defensive back, hand
cuffed the Trojan attack through lack of passing ability.
