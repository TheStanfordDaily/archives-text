A 22-Man Squad
Rice gave his reasons for picking
22 men for his All-America team
(rather than the usual 11) by stat
ing that the All-America team was
originally restricted to cover only
the New England area and that with
the expansion of the area covered
came the virtual impossibility of
accurately picking the 11 men who
were the best.
This year is an attempt to alle
viate the situation of leaving oil'
many good players who may eas
ily he just as good as those hon
ored. Each player will receive
engraved wrist watches as his
award from Rice and the Football
Writers' Association.
Those selected on the team are
Buck of COP, John Carson of
Georgia, Don Dohoney of Michigan
