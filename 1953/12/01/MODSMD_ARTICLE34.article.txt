# Basketball Season Will Open Today As All Three Teams Go into Action
## Frosh 
### 
Coach Dick Clegg sends his fresh
man basketball team against Rich
mond High tonight in a 6:15 pre
liminary game at the Pavilion as the
frosh initiate a 10-game slate.
ClegÂ« will start Bill Bond of
Lontf Beach at one forward. Bond
was All-CIF last year and is ad
vertised as being a crack set shot.
Denis Mahoney of Piedmont has
looked very fine in practice and
will go at the other forward.
Nick Vojvodich, the biggest man
on the squad at 6 ft. 7 in., is a Palo
Alto lad, and gave last year's frosh
a lot of trouble when he played for
Bellarmine.
Hap Wagner, brother of Ron
Wagner who was frosh captain last
season, will start at one guard as
will Beppo Dyer, an ex-Richmond
High player, who goes against his
old mates.
