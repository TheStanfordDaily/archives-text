# Toyon's Tribulations

### JACK BYRNE 
Modern dorms, with hot and
cold running water and steam in
every room, to be built with gate
receipts of Stanford football
teams, a proposed addition to
the University housing system
—this was the status of Bran
ner and Toyon Hails in October
1923.
On Oct. 23 of that year the Daily
Palo Alto, forerunner of today's
Daily, reported of the projected halls:
"Each of the new units will house
four living groups of 34 men each,
totaling 13(J men per unit. The build
ings are planned to give each group
one of the four wings of the dorms
with a living room for each group
and a large clubroom for each unit."
The third floors of the units were to
be given over to guest rooms.
On Oct. i, 1925, The Daily Palo
Alto reported that Toyon Hall was
open for occupancy, but that
Brainier was not yet completed.
Four days later, the I).P. A.
added that living conditions in
Toyon were still "difficult," as the j
corridors were not lit at night, and
were commonly strewn with nail
kegs and saw horses left by the
still-busy carpenters.
Students who sought the sanctu
ary of their rooms were plagued by
painters and plasterers finishing up
their work there.
Approximately a month later, a
report was issued to the effect that
an elevator was to be installed, but
not for the use of the students.
The head custodian and night
watchmen would be the only per
sons given a key, as it was felt
". . . it would just be a matter of
time before some student spent the
night trapped between floors." Evi
dently the elevator never material

ized for none exists today.
On Jan. 7, 192<i the phone buz
zers in Toyon were in operation,
although the operation was spas
modic. The most frequent call in
volved the sounding of the buz
zers for the entire building, thus
routing out the entire population
of the building in a mad scramble
for a phone booth and a usually
non-existent call.
Today, Toyon houses 286 men in
mixed wings varying from 45 to 70
occupants. The rooms originally de
signed for two men now hold four.
Of the 28(5 men. 155 are members
of Eating Clubs (accorded priority
in Toyon housing selection) and 131
independents who eat at Stern or
hash. One guest suite on Toyon's
third floor, complete with bathtub,
now houses five men.
In Branner, the situation is simi

lar. Women instead of men now in
habit that dorm, however. There are
at present 193 of them living two and ,
three to a room.
Few internal changes have been
made in either dorm save the con
struction of apartments for directors.


"DA 3-3121 . . —That's the byword at the busy switchboard
in Toyon Hall which serves Toyon, Bianner, Stern, Crothers,
and Encina Hall. The buzzer system for Toyon and Branner
began working in 1926. —Daily photo by Jack Byrne
