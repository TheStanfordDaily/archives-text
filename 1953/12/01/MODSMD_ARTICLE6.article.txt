## Daily Reporter Describes The Mt. Shasta Tragedy 
### 
(Daily reporter Ellen Hoadley was one of a group of 17 members of
the Stanford Alpine Club which went on a trek to Mt. Shasta last week
end. During the course of the climb up the mountain, Edgar Werner
Hopf, graduate student here, and also a member of the party, died in
an 800-foot fall down the sheer slopes of the 14,612 peak. Miss Hoadley's
account, as it appears below, stands as the Alpine Clubs approved state
ment of the accident.—Editor.
At 4:20 a.m. Saturday, a group of us who were planning on
climbing to the summit, started off from Horse Camp for Lake St.
Helen's, which was about 2500 feet above the camp. We reached
the so-called lake about 6:40 and, after resting for a few minutes,

eight of us started on up the moun
tain on the slope leading up to the
ice shoot. Werner Hopf, who had had
10 years' skiing and climbing expe
rience in the Swiss Alps, did not wait
and rest with us, but started up
ahead.
By 8:15 we had climbed about 600
feet higher using ice axes. Werner
was approximately 400 feet above us
by then, with his skis on, and Don
Faville was half way between us and
Werner and was wearing crampons.
No one else was wearing skis.
Because the icy slope was becom
ing quite difficult to climb, Jon Lind
bergh, leader of the group, decided
that we had better use ropes for
safety. We had just started to tie
into the rope when we looked up and
saw Werner sliding and swirling
down the slope. He was going so fast
that it seemed as though he was way
past us before we could see what ex
actly was happening. Jon and Vlado
Kovalik had jumped out to try to
stop him, but were not able to reach
him. Jon, followed by Vlado, glis
saded down to the spot where Wer
ner, who by now had lost both skis
and was bleeding profusely from the
face and head, had stopped. Jon
forced his mouth open so that he
could breathe, and administered
emergency first aid.
In the meantime, the rest of us
worked our way down to where
Werner had stopped. Sandy Cole
started right down the mountain
for the camp for help, and Paul
Meyer, Peter Holm, and Don Fa
ville helped Vlado fashion a crude
toboggan out of the skis that Paul
and Vlado had carried up, but
had not worn, while Jon contin
ued to give first aid. Then Paul,
Pete, Vlado. and Jon lowered him
to the plateau at Lake St. Helen's.
Meanwhile, Ellen Scarby, Don
Faville, and Ellen Hoadley pro
ceeded down to Horse Camp to
prepare for the arrival of the in
jured man, bringing with them
all others who were cither climb
ing or skiing at lower points on
the mountain.
The four proceeded to bring Wer
ner down to Lake St. Helen. The
500-foot descent was made with ex
treme difficulty and took one hour
and 15 minutes. At that point it
was decidcd that because of the dif
ficulties ahead and his severe con
dition he could be moved no fur
ther. He was made as comfortable
as possible, and Paul Meyer was
sent down on skis for more help.
After two hours, as no help was in
evidence, Jon started down toward
Horse Camp and met with a rescue
party half-way.
When all arrived at the lake at
about 1:50, Werner had already
