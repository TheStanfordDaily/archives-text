## Daily Reporter Describes The Mt. Shasta Tragedy 
### 
(Daily reporter Ellen Hoadley was one of a group of 17 members of
the Stanford Alpine Club which went on a trek to Mt. Shasta last week
end. During the course of the climb up the mountain, Edgar Werner
Hopf, graduate student here, and also a member of the party, died in
an 800-foot fall down the sheer slopes of the 14,612 peak. Miss Hoadley's
account, as it appears below, stands as the Alpine Clubs approved state
ment of the accident.—Editor.
At 4:20 a.m. Saturday, a group of us who were planning on
climbing to the summit, started off from Horse Camp for Lake St.
Helen's, which was about 2500 feet above the camp. We reached
the so-called lake about 6:40 and, after resting for a few minutes,

eight of us started on up the moun
tain on the slope leading up to the
ice shoot. Werner Hopf, who had had
10 years' skiing and climbing expe
rience in the Swiss Alps, did not wait
and rest with us, but started up
ahead.
By 8:15 we had climbed about 600
feet higher using ice axes. Werner
was approximately 400 feet above us
by then, with his skis on, and Don
Faville was half way between us and
Werner and was wearing crampons.
No one else was wearing skis.
Because the icy slope was becom
ing quite difficult to climb, Jon Lind
bergh, leader of the group, decided
that we had better use ropes for
safety. We had just started to tie
into the rope when we looked up and
saw Werner sliding and swirling
down the slope. He was going so fast
that it seemed as though he was way
past us before we could see what ex
actly was happening. Jon and Vlado
Kovalik had jumped out to try to
stop him, but were not able to reach
him. Jon, followed by Vlado, glis
saded down to the spot where Wer
ner, who by now had lost both skis
and was bleeding profusely from the
face and head, had stopped. Jon
forced his mouth open so that he
could breathe, and administered
emergency first aid.
In the meantime, the rest of us
worked our way down to where
Werner had stopped. Sandy Cole
started right down the mountain
for the camp for help, and Paul
Meyer, Peter Holm, and Don Fa
ville helped Vlado fashion a crude
toboggan out of the skis that Paul
and Vlado had carried up, but
had not worn, while Jon contin
ued to give first aid. Then Paul,
Pete, Vlado. and Jon lowered him
to the plateau at Lake St. Helen's.
Meanwhile, Ellen Scarby, Don
Faville, and Ellen Hoadley pro
ceeded down to Horse Camp to
prepare for the arrival of the in
jured man, bringing with them
all others who were cither climb
ing or skiing at lower points on
the mountain.
The four proceeded to bring Wer
ner down to Lake St. Helen. The
500-foot descent was made with ex
treme difficulty and took one hour
and 15 minutes. At that point it
was decidcd that because of the dif
ficulties ahead and his severe con
dition he could be moved no fur
ther. He was made as comfortable
as possible, and Paul Meyer was
sent down on skis for more help.
After two hours, as no help was in
evidence, Jon started down toward
Horse Camp and met with a rescue
party half-way.
When all arrived at the lake at
about 1:50, Werner had already
stopped breathing, so John Mowat,
the first oi' the six to reach the
lake, began the artificial respiration
which lasted for 10 and a half hours
until shortly after midnight, when it
was certain that Werner was dead.
Back at the hut, preparations
for the arrival of Werner and the
rescue party were going on, as the
people down there did not, at that
point, realize exactly how critical
his condition was. About 3, Pete
Holm arrived and told them that
an igloo had been built as protec
tion against the icy winds that
were blowing strongly above, and
that there was no possibility
whatsoever of moving Werner.
Shortly after that, Paul Meyer,
who had since gone back up the
mountain, skied down again and
stopped to tell us that he was on his
way to Shasta City to call San
Francisco for a helicopter. As it I
turned out later, the 'copter was I
unable to leave San Francisco be
cause of fog.
At 9:50, Meyers returned with a !
man from Shasta City and informed

us that two ski patrol members
were on their way with a walkie
talkie with which they were going
to carry on an air drop of plasma
with a plane sent out by the Coast
Guard. The ski patrol members ar
rived about half an hour later, and
the air drop went on from about 11
till shortly after midnight. The
three bundles of plasma that were
dropped were never recovered,
however.
Near 5 a.m., more help, including
Fletcher Hoyt and Merv Adams, ar
rived with plasma and a toboggan
they'd brought up with them, and
started up the mountain to the lake.
They arrived there about 8 to find
that Werner had been assumed dead
since about midnight the previous
evening. The rescue party and the
eight who had spent the night on
the mountain arrived at Horse
Camp with the body at about 10
Sunday morning.

mountain, skied down again and
stopped to tell us that he was on his
way to Shasta City to call San
Francisco for a helicopter. As it I
turned out later, the 'copter was I
unable to leave San Francisco be
cause of fog.
At 9:50, Meyers returned with a !
man from Shasta City and informed

us that two ski patrol members
were on their way with a walkie
talkie with which they were going
to carry on an air drop of plasma
with a plane sent out by the Coast
Guard. The ski patrol members ar
rived about half an hour later, and
the air drop went on from about 11
till shortly after midnight. The
three bundles of plasma that were
dropped were never recovered,
however.
Near 5 a.m., more help, including
Fletcher Hoyt and Merv Adams, ar
rived with plasma and a toboggan
they'd brought up with them, and
started up the mountain to the lake.
They arrived there about 8 to find
that Werner had been assumed dead
since about midnight the previous
evening. The rescue party and the
eight who had spent the night on
the mountain arrived at Horse
Camp with the body at about 10
Sunday morning.
(Daily reporter Ellen Hoadley was one of a group of 17 members of
the Stanford Alpine Club which went on a trek to Mt. Shasta last week
end. During the course of the climb up the mountain, Edgar Werner
Hopf, graduate student here, and also a member of the party, died in
an 800-foot fall down the sheer slopes of the 14,612 peak. Miss Hoadley's
account, as it appears below, stands as the Alpine Clubs approved state
ment of the accident.—Editor.
At 4:20 a.m. Saturday, a group of us who were planning on
climbing to the summit, started off from Horse Camp for Lake St.
Helen's, which was about 2500 feet above the camp. We reached
the so-called lake about 6:40 and, after resting for a few minutes,

eight of us started on up the moun
tain on the slope leading up to the
ice shoot. Werner Hopf, who had had
10 years' skiing and climbing expe
rience in the Swiss Alps, did not wait
and rest with us, but started up
ahead.
By 8:15 we had climbed about 600
feet higher using ice axes. Werner
was approximately 400 feet above us
by then, with his skis on, and Don
Faville was half way between us and
Werner and was wearing crampons.
No one else was wearing skis.
Because the icy slope was becom
ing quite difficult to climb, Jon Lind
bergh, leader of the group, decided
that we had better use ropes for
safety. We had just started to tie
into the rope when we looked up and
saw Werner sliding and swirling
down the slope. He was going so fast
that it seemed as though he was way
past us before we could see what ex
actly was happening. Jon and Vlado
Kovalik had jumped out to try to
stop him, but were not able to reach
him. Jon, followed by Vlado, glis
saded down to the spot where Wer
ner, who by now had lost both skis
and was bleeding profusely from the
face and head, had stopped. Jon
forced his mouth open so that he
could breathe, and administered
emergency first aid.
In the meantime, the rest of us
worked our way down to where
Werner had stopped. Sandy Cole
started right down the mountain
for the camp for help, and Paul
Meyer, Peter Holm, and Don Fa
ville helped Vlado fashion a crude
toboggan out of the skis that Paul
and Vlado had carried up, but
had not worn, while Jon contin
ued to give first aid. Then Paul,
Pete, Vlado. and Jon lowered him
to the plateau at Lake St. Helen's.
Meanwhile, Ellen Scarby, Don
Faville, and Ellen Hoadley pro
ceeded down to Horse Camp to
prepare for the arrival of the in
jured man, bringing with them
all others who were cither climb
ing or skiing at lower points on
the mountain.
The four proceeded to bring Wer
ner down to Lake St. Helen. The
500-foot descent was made with ex
treme difficulty and took one hour
and 15 minutes. At that point it
was decidcd that because of the dif
ficulties ahead and his severe con
dition he could be moved no fur
ther. He was made as comfortable
as possible, and Paul Meyer was
sent down on skis for more help.
After two hours, as no help was in
evidence, Jon started down toward
Horse Camp and met with a rescue
party half-way.
When all arrived at the lake at
about 1:50, Werner had already
stopped breathing, so John Mowat,
the first oi' the six to reach the
lake, began the artificial respiration
which lasted for 10 and a half hours
until shortly after midnight, when it
was certain that Werner was dead.
Back at the hut, preparations
for the arrival of Werner and the
rescue party were going on, as the
people down there did not, at that
point, realize exactly how critical
his condition was. About 3, Pete
Holm arrived and told them that
an igloo had been built as protec
tion against the icy winds that
were blowing strongly above, and
that there was no possibility
whatsoever of moving Werner.

and 15 minutes. At that point it
was decidcd that because of the dif
ficulties ahead and his severe con
dition he could be moved no fur
ther. He was made as comfortable
as possible, and Paul Meyer was
sent down on skis for more help.
After two hours, as no help was in
evidence, Jon started down toward
Horse Camp and met with a rescue
party half-way.
When all arrived at the lake at
about 1:50, Werner had already
stopped breathing, so John Mowat,
the first oi' the six to reach the
lake, began the artificial respiration
which lasted for 10 and a half hours
until shortly after midnight, when it
was certain that Werner was dead.
Back at the hut, preparations
for the arrival of Werner and the
rescue party were going on, as the
people down there did not, at that
point, realize exactly how critical
his condition was. About 3, Pete
Holm arrived and told them that
an igloo had been built as protec
tion against the icy winds that
were blowing strongly above, and
that there was no possibility
whatsoever of moving Werner.
Shortly after that, Paul Meyer,
who had since gone back up the
mountain, skied down again and
stopped to tell us that he was on his
way to Shasta City to call San
Francisco for a helicopter. As it I
turned out later, the 'copter was I
unable to leave San Francisco be
cause of fog.
At 9:50, Meyers returned with a !
man from Shasta City and informed

us that two ski patrol members
were on their way with a walkie
talkie with which they were going
to carry on an air drop of plasma
with a plane sent out by the Coast
Guard. The ski patrol members ar
rived about half an hour later, and
the air drop went on from about 11
till shortly after midnight. The
three bundles of plasma that were
dropped were never recovered,
however.
Near 5 a.m., more help, including
Fletcher Hoyt and Merv Adams, ar
rived with plasma and a toboggan
they'd brought up with them, and
started up the mountain to the lake.
They arrived there about 8 to find
that Werner had been assumed dead
since about midnight the previous
evening. The rescue party and the
eight who had spent the night on
the mountain arrived at Horse
Camp with the body at about 10
Sunday morning.
(Daily reporter Ellen Hoadley was one of a group of 17 members of
the Stanford Alpine Club which went on a trek to Mt. Shasta last week
end. During the course of the climb up the mountain, Edgar Werner
Hopf, graduate student here, and also a member of the party, died in
an 800-foot fall down the sheer slopes of the 14,612 peak. Miss Hoadley's
account, as it appears below, stands as the Alpine Clubs approved state
ment of the accident.—Editor.
At 4:20 a.m. Saturday, a group of us who were planning on
climbing to the summit, started off from Horse Camp for Lake St.
Helen's, which was about 2500 feet above the camp. We reached
the so-called lake about 6:40 and, after resting for a few minutes,

eight of us started on up the moun
tain on the slope leading up to the
ice shoot. Werner Hopf, who had had
10 years' skiing and climbing expe
rience in the Swiss Alps, did not wait
and rest with us, but started up
ahead.
By 8:15 we had climbed about 600
feet higher using ice axes. Werner
was approximately 400 feet above us
by then, with his skis on, and Don
Faville was half way between us and
Werner and was wearing crampons.
No one else was wearing skis.
Because the icy slope was becom
ing quite difficult to climb, Jon Lind
bergh, leader of the group, decided
that we had better use ropes for
safety. We had just started to tie
into the rope when we looked up and
saw Werner sliding and swirling
down the slope. He was going so fast
that it seemed as though he was way
past us before we could see what ex
actly was happening. Jon and Vlado
Kovalik had jumped out to try to
stop him, but were not able to reach
him. Jon, followed by Vlado, glis
saded down to the spot where Wer
ner, who by now had lost both skis
and was bleeding profusely from the
face and head, had stopped. Jon
forced his mouth open so that he
could breathe, and administered
emergency first aid.
In the meantime, the rest of us
worked our way down to where
Werner had stopped. Sandy Cole
started right down the mountain
for the camp for help, and Paul
Meyer, Peter Holm, and Don Fa
ville helped Vlado fashion a crude
toboggan out of the skis that Paul
and Vlado had carried up, but
had not worn, while Jon contin
ued to give first aid. Then Paul,
Pete, Vlado. and Jon lowered him
to the plateau at Lake St. Helen's.
Meanwhile, Ellen Scarby, Don
Faville, and Ellen Hoadley pro
ceeded down to Horse Camp to
prepare for the arrival of the in
jured man, bringing with them
all others who were cither climb
ing or skiing at lower points on
the mountain.
The four proceeded to bring Wer
ner down to Lake St. Helen. The
500-foot descent was made with ex
treme difficulty and took one hour

was decidcd that because of the dif
