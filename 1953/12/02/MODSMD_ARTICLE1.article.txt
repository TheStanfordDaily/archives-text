## Dulles Blasts McCarthy On Foreign Policy Issues 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 (UP)—Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles today accused Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy of attacking "the
very heart of U.S. foreign policy" and said his criticism of the
Wisconsin Republican had President Eisenhower's endorsement.
McCarthy had no immediate comment but promptly scheduled

a news conference for tomorrow or
Thursday to issue his reply. Mr.
Eisenhower also will meet with the
press tomorrow and administration
sources predicted he will back Dul
les to the hilt.
In an unusual news conference
statement, Dulles charged that Mc-
Carthy wants the United States to
resort to "threats and intimidation"
to force its allies to follow its "bid
ding in international affairs. He
said he and Mr. Eisenhower "do not
propose" to adopt such methods.
Dulles issued his statement in
reply to the TV-radio broadcast
McCarthy made last week at the
height of the furor over the Harry
Dexter White case. McCarthy's
speech primarily was a reply to
former President Truman but he
also criticized the Eisenhower ad
ministration.
McCarthy arrived here from Wis
consin several hours after Dulles'
news conference. He told reporters
who met his plane that he had not
read the Secretary's statement and
would not have any immediate
comment.
When a reporter handed him a
copy, McCarthy started to read it,
grinned, and asked, "Do you think
he could have been referring to
me?"
Dulles said he conferred with
Mr. Eisenhower before issuing his
statement — the first administra
tion reply to McCarthy's criticism
of Republican foreign policy. It
also was the (irst time a member
of Mr. Eisenhower's cabinet had
tangled publicly with the contro
versial Republican Senator.
Dulles did not mention McCarthy
by name. But he loft no doubt as
to whom he meant by referring to
a pertinent quote in the Senator's
broadcast. McCarthy had demanded
that the United States cut off aid to
Great Britain until the British halt
all trade with Red China. Then
McCarhy said:
"Are we going to continue to send
perfumed notes, following the style
of the Truman-Acheson regime?"
Dulles said the burden of Mc-
Carthy's criticism was that "we
spoke too kindly to our Allies and
sent them 'perfumed' notes, in
stead of using threats and intimi
dation to compel them to our bid
ding."
"I welcome constructive criti
cism," he said. "But the criticism I
refer to attacks the very heart of
U.S. foreign policy."
Dulles said the policy McCarthy
criticized was aimed, among other
things, at saving U.S. industrial cit
ies from Russian atomic attack. He
said these cities include Detroit,
Cleveland, Chicago, and Milwaukee
—in McCarthy's home state.
The Secretary said these cities
would be wide open to surprise at
tack without "well - located" U.S.
bases and warning systems main
tained in Allied countries.
