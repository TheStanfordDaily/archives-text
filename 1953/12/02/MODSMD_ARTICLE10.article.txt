row" discussions, Frederic O. Glover, Assistant to the University-
President, spoke last night in the Encina lounge on Stanford's
building and land development plans and University administra

University" only 2,030 students live
in campus dormitories and houses,
excluding the Village. He said that
construction of .the new Encina is
scheduled to get under way as soon
as weather permits — probably
sometime next quarter. An active
program is now under way to fi
nance the building.
lie predicted that Hie admission
problem will hccomc even more
acute as students born during the
war years reach college age.
Described as "still on the draw
ing board" are plans for construc
tion of a "Science Quad" near the
present microwave laboratory. This
addition might include the medical
school alter it is moved down from
San Francisco, he said.
Glover pointed out that the Stan
ford property—approximately 9,000
acres—is nearly as large as the city
of San Francisco. Two hundred
acres of this land arc now being de
veloped for light industry, and
leases are being negotiated for the
building of a shopping center on
Stanford property along El Camino,
north of the Palo Alto Hospital. The
area set aside for residential pur
poses could be developed into a
community of 45,000 population, he
added.
In answer In a question from
the audience, Glover said that this
land development will not neces
sarily lead to reduced tuition be
cause of ever-rising costs.
The speaker then outlined the or
ganization of the University admin
istration. Heading the administra
tion is Stanford's 15-man Board of
Trustees. Below Dr. Sterling, he
explained, is the Provost second
ranking University officer—and two

Stanford as "the greatest independ
ent university west of Chicago."
