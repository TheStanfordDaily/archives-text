# Whitaker Will Give STT Talk
## 
### 
Douglas M. Whitaker, Provost of
the University, will discuss Univer
sity policies tonight at 7 in the
Branner lobby.
The talk will conclude the current
"Stanford — Today and Tomorrow"
series of administration and faculty
talks to the freshmen. During the
past two weeks, various University
officials have talked in all freshman

living groups, beginning with Presi
dent J. Wallace Sterling at the Vil
lage on Monday, Nov. 23.
No definite topic has been decided
upon, according to Pete Sabin,
chairman of the program series. The
discussion is planned on a broad
scope so freshmen can bring up any
questions they might have regard
ing any phase of the University's
organization, policy, or problems,
Sabin said.
Buzz Fineberg will moderate the
discussion, which will consist of a
short talk followed by question and
answer periods. Sophomore resi
dents of Branner are also invited to
attend the program.
