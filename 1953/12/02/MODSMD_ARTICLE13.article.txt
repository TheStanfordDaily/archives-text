# Tomsic, Suzdaleff Hot as Indian Cagers Beat Alumni 69 to 56 in Season Opener
## 
### PETE GROTHE Sports Editor, The Daily 
Stanford's basketballing
alumni team kept pace with the
undergraduates for almost three
quarters in the Pavilion last |
night and then succumbed, 69 to
56, to superior conditioning plus
the marksmanship of Ron Tom-;
sic and Olie Suzdaleff.
But it remained for ;in old grad to !
grab the scoring honors . . . iceman
Jim Ramstead, All-Coast center in
15)52, who hasn't lost the old smooth !
touch. Rammer meshed seven field
goals and eight free throws for 22
points.
Ron (the Cat) Tomsic spearhead- '
ed the varsity with 13 while Suz- !
dalcfT had 12, George Sclleck 11, i
Russ Lawler 10, and Don DeLong, fl. j
Interestingly enough, each of the j
five starters was within one point i
of another.
(.■lis Chavalas. ASSIJ proxy in
tallied nine, as did forward
Have Davidson. Frosh Coach Dick
Clcgg dunked eight.
The varsity rang up a 15 to 10
first-quarter lead, but with Ram
stcad sinking tips and under-the
basket lay-ins, the alumni caught
up to 28 to 30 at the end of the
half.
The alums had a 30 to 38 advan
tage midway in the third quarter,
and then they began to run out of
Has. DeLong hit a beautiful side
shot, Lawler a charity toss, and
SuzdalefT a fadeaway jump and
then a free shot. Tomsic then
caught fire with two difficult under
the-basket running lay-ups, De-

Long connected with another side
jump shot, and Selleck made good a
free throw.
When the dust had lifted, the
undergrads had pulled away to a
51 to 40 lead as the fourth quar-

[ tcr began. They never relin
quished the lead.
At half - time, Tomsic and Suz
dalcff were presented with gold
watches as last year's most valu
able players.
