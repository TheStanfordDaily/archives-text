### BOB REZAK Associate Editor, The Daily 
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. I—The House Un-American Activities
Committee, led by Chairman Harold H. Velde (R. 111.) opened a
two-week stormy inguiry here today into Communist activities in
community affairs in Northern California.
Key developments that unfolded v/ith dramatic impact before

a jam-packed hearing room at City |
Hall included:
1. A former Yale University in
structor, Donald N. Wheeler, named
by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover as
a one-time member of a Soviet spy
ling, refused to testify whether he
knew the late Harry Dexter White,
the principal figure in the contro
versy between Attorney General
Herbert Brownell and former Presi
dent Truman.
2. Louis Rosser, former Commu
nist described as "one of the top
functionaries" in the Communist
Party, named Louis Goldblatt, .sec
retary-treasurer of the International
Longshoremen's and Warehouse
men's Union, as a former Communist
who wrote a pamphlet entitled
"Young Communists in Action,"
which predicted an eventual "Soviet
America."
3. And shortly after Rosser's
lengthy testimony, Local 10 of the
ILWU called a "stop work" meet- i
ing for Thursday In protest the
House Committee's hearings. Ship
clerks as well as longshoremen !
were expected to slay off the job j
all day Thursday with the long- |
shoremen scheduled to pack City j
Ilall at 9:30 a.m.
4. Veldc announced that tomor- j
row's session will place the emphasis
on "witnesses who will name mem
bers of the Communist Party from
the Oakland area."
Wheeler, a former instructor in
government at Yale, and a former
employee of the Office of Strategic !
Services, flatly refused time and time
again to answer on constitutional
grounds the committee's questions.
He refused to disclose whether he
knew the late Harry Dexter White
or Elizabeth Bentlcy, former Com
munist courier who has been a star
witness in previous Red investiga
tions.
Committee Counsel Frank S. Tav
enner, Jr., read into the record a
portion of Miss Bentley's testimony
before the House Committee in 1948,
in which she named Wheeler as one
of the Communists in the govern
ment who provided secret data for j
the Victor Pcrlo "spy ring."
Tavenner asked the nervous, pale
faced witness if he was familiar wilh
that testimony. Wheeler replied,
"No."
"Did you not deny in the press
that her statements wen- true,"
Tavenner questioned him again.
"I refuse to answer that question
on the same grounds as before,
Wheeler declared.
As Wheeler, sitting in a high-back
brown leather swivel chair, con
tinued to answer questions on the
basis of the Fifth Amendment, Tav
enner asked him if it was not a fact
that he simply refused to "answer
any questions."
"Well, sir," Wheeler said halting
ly, "I am answering these questions
to the best of my ability,"
Veldc asked Wheeler if be con
sidered himself at the present time
to be a loyal American citizen.
Wheeler, again consulting with his
attorney momentarily, looked up at
Veldc and answered: "My opinion i.>
that I certainly am."
"Were you a loyal citizen at the
time you knew •Elizabeth Benl
ley?" Veldc snapped back.
"It seems to me that's a 'beat
your wife' type of question." the
slightly bald, bespectacled witness
declared.
Velde, at the close of the hearing,
looked directly at Wheeler and told
him firmly:
"Your refusal to testify points up
the need for additional security
legislation."
Wheeler stated he graduated from
Reed College in Portland, Ore., in
193. r > and attended the University of
Paris in 1937 and 1938. He said he
taught at Yale in 1938 to 1939 and
that he studied at Oxford Univer
sity in England under a Rhodes
! Scholarship he received in l!>3. r >.

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. I—The House Un-American Activities
Committee, led by Chairman Harold H. Velde (R. 111.) opened a
two-week stormy inguiry here today into Communist activities in
community affairs in Northern California.
Key developments that unfolded v/ith dramatic impact before

a jam-packed hearing room at City |
Hall included:
1. A former Yale University in
structor, Donald N. Wheeler, named
by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover as
a one-time member of a Soviet spy
ling, refused to testify whether he
knew the late Harry Dexter White,
the principal figure in the contro
versy between Attorney General
Herbert Brownell and former Presi
dent Truman.
2. Louis Rosser, former Commu
nist described as "one of the top
functionaries" in the Communist
Party, named Louis Goldblatt, .sec
retary-treasurer of the International
Longshoremen's and Warehouse
men's Union, as a former Communist
who wrote a pamphlet entitled
"Young Communists in Action,"
which predicted an eventual "Soviet
America."
3. And shortly after Rosser's
lengthy testimony, Local 10 of the
ILWU called a "stop work" meet- i
ing for Thursday In protest the
House Committee's hearings. Ship
clerks as well as longshoremen !
were expected to slay off the job j
all day Thursday with the long- |
shoremen scheduled to pack City j
Ilall at 9:30 a.m.
4. Veldc announced that tomor- j
row's session will place the emphasis
on "witnesses who will name mem
bers of the Communist Party from
the Oakland area."
Wheeler, a former instructor in
government at Yale, and a former
employee of the Office of Strategic !
Services, flatly refused time and time
again to answer on constitutional
grounds the committee's questions.
He refused to disclose whether he
knew the late Harry Dexter White
or Elizabeth Bentlcy, former Com
munist courier who has been a star
witness in previous Red investiga
tions.
Committee Counsel Frank S. Tav
enner, Jr., read into the record a
portion of Miss Bentley's testimony
before the House Committee in 1948,
in which she named Wheeler as one
of the Communists in the govern
ment who provided secret data for j
the Victor Pcrlo "spy ring."
Tavenner asked the nervous, pale
faced witness if he was familiar wilh
that testimony. Wheeler replied,
"No."
"Did you not deny in the press
that her statements wen- true,"
Tavenner questioned him again.
"I refuse to answer that question
on the same grounds as before,
Wheeler declared.
As Wheeler, sitting in a high-back
brown leather swivel chair, con
tinued to answer questions on the
basis of the Fifth Amendment, Tav
enner asked him if it was not a fact
that he simply refused to "answer
any questions."
"Well, sir," Wheeler said halting
ly, "I am answering these questions
to the best of my ability,"
Veldc asked Wheeler if be con
sidered himself at the present time
to be a loyal American citizen.
Wheeler, again consulting with his
attorney momentarily, looked up at
Veldc and answered: "My opinion i.>
that I certainly am."
"Were you a loyal citizen at the
time you knew •Elizabeth Benl
ley?" Veldc snapped back.
"It seems to me that's a 'beat
your wife' type of question." the
slightly bald, bespectacled witness
declared.
Velde, at the close of the hearing,
looked directly at Wheeler and told
him firmly:
"Your refusal to testify points up
the need for additional security
legislation."
Wheeler stated he graduated from
Reed College in Portland, Ore., in
193. r > and attended the University of
Paris in 1937 and 1938. He said he
taught at Yale in 1938 to 1939 and

attorney momentarily, looked up at
Veldc and answered: "My opinion i.>
that I certainly am."
"Were you a loyal citizen at the
time you knew •Elizabeth Benl
ley?" Veldc snapped back.
"It seems to me that's a 'beat
your wife' type of question." the
slightly bald, bespectacled witness
declared.
Velde, at the close of the hearing,
looked directly at Wheeler and told
him firmly:
"Your refusal to testify points up
the need for additional security
legislation."
Wheeler stated he graduated from
Reed College in Portland, Ore., in
193. r > and attended the University of
Paris in 1937 and 1938. He said he
taught at Yale in 1938 to 1939 and

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. I—The House Un-American Activities
Committee, led by Chairman Harold H. Velde (R. 111.) opened a
two-week stormy inguiry here today into Communist activities in
community affairs in Northern California.
Key developments that unfolded v/ith dramatic impact before

a jam-packed hearing room at City |
Hall included:
1. A former Yale University in
structor, Donald N. Wheeler, named
by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover as
a one-time member of a Soviet spy
ling, refused to testify whether he
knew the late Harry Dexter White,
the principal figure in the contro
versy between Attorney General
Herbert Brownell and former Presi
dent Truman.
2. Louis Rosser, former Commu
nist described as "one of the top
functionaries" in the Communist
Party, named Louis Goldblatt, .sec
retary-treasurer of the International
Longshoremen's and Warehouse
men's Union, as a former Communist
who wrote a pamphlet entitled
"Young Communists in Action,"
which predicted an eventual "Soviet
America."
3. And shortly after Rosser's
lengthy testimony, Local 10 of the
ILWU called a "stop work" meet- i
ing for Thursday In protest the
House Committee's hearings. Ship
clerks as well as longshoremen !
were expected to slay off the job j
all day Thursday with the long- |
shoremen scheduled to pack City j
Ilall at 9:30 a.m.
4. Veldc announced that tomor- j
row's session will place the emphasis
on "witnesses who will name mem
bers of the Communist Party from
the Oakland area."
Wheeler, a former instructor in
government at Yale, and a former
employee of the Office of Strategic !
Services, flatly refused time and time
again to answer on constitutional
grounds the committee's questions.
He refused to disclose whether he
knew the late Harry Dexter White
or Elizabeth Bentlcy, former Com
munist courier who has been a star
witness in previous Red investiga
tions.
Committee Counsel Frank S. Tav
enner, Jr., read into the record a
portion of Miss Bentley's testimony
before the House Committee in 1948,
in which she named Wheeler as one
of the Communists in the govern
ment who provided secret data for j
the Victor Pcrlo "spy ring."
Tavenner asked the nervous, pale
faced witness if he was familiar wilh
that testimony. Wheeler replied,
"No."
"Did you not deny in the press
that her statements wen- true,"
Tavenner questioned him again.
"I refuse to answer that question
on the same grounds as before,
Wheeler declared.
As Wheeler, sitting in a high-back
brown leather swivel chair, con
tinued to answer questions on the
basis of the Fifth Amendment, Tav
enner asked him if it was not a fact
that he simply refused to "answer
any questions."
"Well, sir," Wheeler said halting
ly, "I am answering these questions
to the best of my ability,"
Veldc asked Wheeler if be con
sidered himself at the present time
to be a loyal American citizen.
Wheeler, again consulting with his
attorney momentarily, looked up at
Veldc and answered: "My opinion i.>
that I certainly am."
"Were you a loyal citizen at the
time you knew •Elizabeth Benl
ley?" Veldc snapped back.
"It seems to me that's a 'beat
your wife' type of question." the
slightly bald, bespectacled witness
declared.
Velde, at the close of the hearing,
looked directly at Wheeler and told
him firmly:
"Your refusal to testify points up
the need for additional security
legislation."
Wheeler stated he graduated from

193. r > and attended the University of

that he studied at Oxford Univer
sity in England under a Rhodes
