### HADLEY ROFF Editor, The Daily 
Before calling the first wit-
J ness in yesterday's dramatic
day-long hearing into Bay Area
: Communist activities, Rep. Har
old Velde (R., 111.), tall, broad
shouldered chairman of the Un-
American Activities Committee,
explained the purposes and the
aims of the investigation.
"We arc not interested in the po
litical beliefs or philosophies of j
witnesses called before this - com- I
mittee," he said gravely.
"We*are interested in facts on
the extent, character, and objec- j
fives of Communism in the Bay !
Area so that Congress may frame j
any necessary remedial legislation." |
A( the conclusion of the j
j lengthy Ixi ( tensely absorbing
session, Rep. Donald L. Jackson
j (R., Calif.), one of the members j
of the committee, told The Daily I
i that yesterday's hearings "deli- !
nitely pointed tip tlie- need" for |
legislation to prevent witnesses ;
from dodging behind the Fifth
I Amendment to the Constitution.
J The amendment states that no one
j should he forced to give testi
mony that might be self-incrimi
| nating.
fie said he would favor legislation
that would giant, a witness immu
nity from prosecution while he tes
tifies before a Congressional com
mittee.
"With such immunity," the Con
gressman said, "there would be no
excuse for anyone refusing to tes
tify because of fear of self-incrimi
nation ... as Mr. Wheeler did to
day."
Refusal to testify, under immu
nity legislation, would be grounds
j for contempt of Congress, Jackson |
said.
He reported that a bill ordering |
such measures has been introduced !
in the Senate and has been reported '
favorably out of the Senate Judicial j
, Committee. He was not aware, he
said, as to whether such legislation
is pending in the House.
"I intend to look into the mat
i ter when I got back to Washing
ton," Jackson said, "and if there j
is no bill providing for immunity j
for witnesses, then I'll take steps
to see that there is one."
Known 1r» favor the outlawing of
the Communis! party, Jackson,
when asked if such legislation
might lend to drive the Communists
further underground, said it was his
! contention thai such would not be j
the case.
"How much farther underground
could they get?" he asked.
"You know,' he quipped, "about'
seven-eighths of an iceberg is below !
the surface."
