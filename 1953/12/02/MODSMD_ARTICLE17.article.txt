"Are you now a membo;

"I have."
With those two word:;, Loui I'

clerk from Los Angeles, began
six-and-a-half-hour testimony
his 12 years as a Communist ':

training school conducted "on

state. (Rosser said that the : t.i
had not been allowed to If . ■
premises and he did not know •
names of near-by towns.)
At the school, Rosser and
60 other Communists—attended
tures and discussions on Con
nist theory and practice.
Rosser recalled one lectin !
heard at the school in wlii<
was told that he was l>< i
trained to "one day be a m j
sentative in the Supreme S .
of the United States."
At this time, Rosser :;n
learned the meaning of part

He reported that for w< < i
was shunned and badgei'd le
fellow Communists until iie finally
igned a statement that he had
broken party discipline and be
trayed the Negro people."
From then on. Rosser testified,
"1 began to get sick of (he whole
C o in in un is t movement." He
ceased to devote his full time to
the party, and began to "look
around for ways out."
Rosser's final break with the par
ty came in 1944 when he failed to
get the Communist leaders in San
Francisco to intercede when 50 Ne
gro sailors refused to load Russian
bound ships because of dangerous
working conditions.
"Look," a Communist official told
him. "What's more important —
loading those ships with supplies for
the Soviet Union or those 50 sail
ors?"
Then, Ros&er said, he really
quit. "But it wasn't over." His
associates tried to "patch it up
with him," he said, and warned
him that "you can't heat the
party."
But quit he did—although it be
came suddenly hard to hold even
menial jobs when Communist
■'roups would warn his employers
of his "undesirability."
"I had discovered finally that
the Communists don't reallv care

. j
about the Negroes — they only !
support them when it suits their
purposes," he said.
It was 4:20 p.m. when Louis Ros
ser, still calm in the light-flooded
witness chair, finished his testimony
—the testimony of an ex-Commu
nist.
"I want to be a loyal citizen of
America," he told the committee. "I
want to explain the threat of the
Communist conspiracy; I want to !
try to educate the Negro to under- [
stand."
And Louis Rosser—friendly wit
ness—was dismissed with thanks by
Representative Velde.

had not been allowed to If . ■
premises and he did not know •
names of near-by towns.)
At the school, Rosser and
60 other Communists—attended
tures and discussions on Con
nist theory and practice.
Rosser recalled one lectin !
heard at the school in wlii<
was told that he was l>< i
trained to "one day be a m j
sentative in the Supreme S .
of the United States."
At this time, Rosser :;n
learned the meaning of part

He reported that for w< < i
was shunned and badgei'd le
fellow Communists until iie finally
igned a statement that he had
broken party discipline and be
trayed the Negro people."
From then on. Rosser testified,
"1 began to get sick of (he whole
C o in in un is t movement." He
ceased to devote his full time to
the party, and began to "look
around for ways out."
Rosser's final break with the par
ty came in 1944 when he failed to
get the Communist leaders in San
Francisco to intercede when 50 Ne
gro sailors refused to load Russian
bound ships because of dangerous
working conditions.
"Look," a Communist official told
him. "What's more important —
loading those ships with supplies for
the Soviet Union or those 50 sail
ors?"
Then, Ros&er said, he really
quit. "But it wasn't over." His
associates tried to "patch it up
with him," he said, and warned
him that "you can't heat the
party."
But quit he did—although it be
came suddenly hard to hold even
menial jobs when Communist
■'roups would warn his employers
of his "undesirability."
"I had discovered finally that
the Communists don't reallv care

. j
about the Negroes — they only !
support them when it suits their
purposes," he said.
It was 4:20 p.m. when Louis Ros
ser, still calm in the light-flooded
witness chair, finished his testimony
—the testimony of an ex-Commu
nist.
"I want to be a loyal citizen of
America," he told the committee. "I
want to explain the threat of the
Communist conspiracy; I want to !
try to educate the Negro to under- [
stand."
And Louis Rosser—friendly wit
ness—was dismissed with thanks by
Representative Velde.
