## Shootin' the Breeze 
### 
It's a little early to be thinking of the Olympic Games, which won't come
off until the winter of 1956, but our attention has been focused on the
world's greatest sports event by the meeting of the United States Olympic
Association this week in Washington, D.C.
The meeting is composed of the top men in all the various sports that
go to make ud the Olympics. Stanford indirectly received a terrific honor

when Tom Haynie was chosen on the Olympic Swim
ming Committee for the second time.
Haynie, you'll remember, is the likeable young swim
ming and water polo coach here on the Farm. He's
one of the eight NCAA representatives on the Commit
tee, which also includes eight of the top dogs in the
AAU.
This eight and eight situation makes for some in
volved political wrangles: Haynie told us that it look
seven hours to complete the voting for one of the as
sistant coaches on the '52 squad.
Incidentally, Haynie is about due to pull down some of

tne coaching jobs on these international .swimming junKeis. uur Washing
ton correspondent tells us not to be surprised if Haynie,is chosen as the
Head Swimming Coach on the United States Pan-American team. The
Pan-American Games are scheduled for Mexico City in 1955.
The biggest news to come out of the present meeting in Washington was
the announcement yesterday of the retirement of Avery Brundage, presi
dent of Olympic Association. During his 25 years as president, Brundage
has hit the spotlight repeatedly.
On the boat to the 19.'Hi Olympics, Brundage was forced to kick
Eleanor Holm off the swimming team when Miss Holm, later the wife
of columnist Biily Rose, held her own private celebration for several days.
More recently, he sent home a member of the women's ski team in 1952
whn it was discovered that she was within six months of becoming a
mother.
Brundage's successor as president will be "Tug" Wilson, presently
commissioner of the Big Ten. Wilson threw the javelin for the United
States in the 1920 Olympics at Stockholm.

To inject a local note into this column, and High-Mucky-Muck Grothe
says we have to have a local comment in every column, liaynie's water
polo.team set two Pacific Coast Conference scoring records this season.
The one-game team total mark of 16 was surpassed when the Cards beat
USC 17 to 4 in the early season, and the season team record of 57 goals
fell as the Indians scored 59 for six games. Leading the way in the record
setting spree were seniors Jim Gaughran and Jim Lee.

ton correspondent tells us not to be surprised if Haynie,is chosen as the
Head Swimming Coach on the United States Pan-American team. The
Pan-American Games are scheduled for Mexico City in 1955.
The biggest news to come out of the present meeting in Washington was
the announcement yesterday of the retirement of Avery Brundage, presi
dent of Olympic Association. During his 25 years as president, Brundage
has hit the spotlight repeatedly.
On the boat to the 19.'Hi Olympics, Brundage was forced to kick
Eleanor Holm off the swimming team when Miss Holm, later the wife
of columnist Biily Rose, held her own private celebration for several days.
More recently, he sent home a member of the women's ski team in 1952
whn it was discovered that she was within six months of becoming a
mother.
Brundage's successor as president will be "Tug" Wilson, presently
commissioner of the Big Ten. Wilson threw the javelin for the United
States in the 1920 Olympics at Stockholm.

To inject a local note into this column, and High-Mucky-Muck Grothe
says we have to have a local comment in every column, liaynie's water
polo.team set two Pacific Coast Conference scoring records this season.
The one-game team total mark of 16 was surpassed when the Cards beat
USC 17 to 4 in the early season, and the season team record of 57 goals
fell as the Indians scored 59 for six games. Leading the way in the record
setting spree were seniors Jim Gaughran and Jim Lee.

It's a little early to be thinking of the Olympic Games, which won't come
off until the winter of 1956, but our attention has been focused on the
world's greatest sports event by the meeting of the United States Olympic
Association this week in Washington, D.C.
The meeting is composed of the top men in all the various sports that
go to make ud the Olympics. Stanford indirectly received a terrific honor

when Tom Haynie was chosen on the Olympic Swim
ming Committee for the second time.
Haynie, you'll remember, is the likeable young swim
ming and water polo coach here on the Farm. He's
one of the eight NCAA representatives on the Commit
tee, which also includes eight of the top dogs in the
AAU.
This eight and eight situation makes for some in
volved political wrangles: Haynie told us that it look
seven hours to complete the voting for one of the as
sistant coaches on the '52 squad.
Incidentally, Haynie is about due to pull down some of
