## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
Stanford frosh showed considerable potential ability and a
need for experience as they edged out the Richmond High School
quintet 77-69 in the Pavilion last night.
The smooth-working Richmond Oilers played from behind al
most all the way, but were a constant threat to the frosh.

Flashy Bill Bond, an All-CIF for
ward from Long Beach, was the top
scorer of the Â£ame. He netted six
field goals and nine free throws for
a total of 21 points.
Denis Mahoney of Piedmont and
Beppo Dyer, a former Richmond
player, were impressive as they
hooped 13 and 12 points respectively
for the frosh.
Guard Hap Wagner looked quite
good as he turned in the best de
fensive game of the evening for the
Farm five.
For the Oilers J. D. Banks, a
rangy forward, led the scoring with
17. backed up by Art Hardeman and
A 1 Farmer with 15 apiece.
Many frosh reserves played in the
tight contest as Coach Dick Clegg
had his first opportunity to see his
men in action.
