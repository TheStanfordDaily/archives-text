# Brave Basketballers Overpower Napa JC
## 
### HOMER SMITH 
Playing a cautious and ball-control type game, the Braves
dumped an ineffectual Napa JC team in yesterday afternoon's cam
pus basketball opener in the Encina Gym. The Braves led 30-14
and had held the Napa Chiefs to just three field goals at the end of
the first half of the contest.
Paul Perko scored 10 points on four field goals and two foul

'shots to lead all the Braves in scor
ing, but Boyboso of the Chiefs was
high man for the game with 10
points on four goals from the floor
and eight from the free-throw line.
Five rtiinutes and 50 seconds were
gone in the first half bfcfore Napa
was able to score from the floor,
but by then the Braves were well on
their way with 10 points on the
board. Napa was unable to get in
side the key area and could not hit
from outside, so the issue was no
longer in c'oubt after the first few
minutes of the second period.
With Perko. John Hendricks,
Gunnar Christenson, Boh Milton,
and Bob McGrath all hitting as
the opportunities presented them
selves, the Braves pulled farther
and farther away from Napa.
In the second period Boyboso
started driving in from outside and
hitting his medium length set shots
and was able to keep Napa from
being completely routed.
Coach George Lynn played all 13

of his Braves in the contest, while
Napa used only eight men with
Melvin Transtad and Boyboso play

ing the whole 40 minutes of the i
game. j
