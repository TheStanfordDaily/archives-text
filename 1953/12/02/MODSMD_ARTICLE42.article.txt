# Enema Men Relax: Stanford Sadie Is Stillman Soph Mary Ann Hood
## 
### BILL GEYER 
The ever-mounting tension
has been relieved. The mystery
has been solved. The secret is
out. Now the Encina boys can
once more selax and settle down
to earnest work on the musty
tomes. Stanford Sadie has been
revealed.
The unabashed source of all this
uproar is a winsome little Stillman
sophomore named Mary Alice Hood,
the pro>d possessor of the only pair
of blue saddle shoes on campus. She
also answered to the name of "Mal
ice," a holdover from her career
days, when she modeled exclusive
fashions in Los Angeles under the
name of Malice A. Forethot.
She was born "long ago" (when
asked her age, she declined to an
swer, replying, "You mean mental,
physical, or the one on my ID?), but
soon overcame that handicap, and
presently graduated from South
Pasadena High School, heretofore
renowned only for producing Gar
rett and Morley. She still resides
in San Marino occasionally.
Her intended major is anything
| from elementary education to in
ternational relations, and, being a
hard-studying lass, she went plus
1.5 last year and states, with un
derstandable modesty, "I hope to
do almost as well this year,"
Her personality shows several
unusual traits, but, as she herself
explains it,"I got this way from
studying too hard in high school."
She is a confirmed hater of classical
music, and likewise abominates
modern art. She really doesn't mind
I
j vodka, but "it's those horrid com
binations thai get me."

Statistically speaking, Miss Hood
is five feet five inches and carries
her 118 pounds in 34-24-35 propor
tions.
Her wide eyes are hazel. Other
items include: nose, one; teeth,
sharp; neck, yes; and ears, possibly

■ a secret that could not be revealed
without a consultation with her hair
stylist.
Commenting on the job she has
just vacated, she says,"I think it's
great, except that they ought to
have a Stanford Sam, so us poor

little girls would have someone to
listen to. I've got a few people in
mind for the job already."
She believes that her successor
should be from Roble, "so all those
boys will go where they're needed
most."
The tradition of Stanford Sadie,
it may be added, dates from 1947,
when the program was first con
ceived. The purpose of the program
has been to drive Encina men away
from their studies and into insanity.
For some time it was broadcast at
10:30 to give Stanford women a
chance to listen, but commercial
conflicts forced a switch to the pres
ent 10 o'clock time.
Each quarter there has been a
different Sadie, coming from vari
ous walks of Stanford life and
ranging from frosh to seniors. At
the last program of each quarter,
her identity is disclosed.
And next quarter at 10 o'clock on
Monday nights a new and tempo
rarily unidentified Stanford Sadie
will again extend a mysterious
voice to KZSU listeners.

Her intended major is anything
| from elementary education to in
ternational relations, and, being a
hard-studying lass, she went plus
1.5 last year and states, with un
derstandable modesty, "I hope to
do almost as well this year,"
Her personality shows several
unusual traits, but, as she herself
explains it,"I got this way from
studying too hard in high school."
She is a confirmed hater of classical
music, and likewise abominates
modern art. She really doesn't mind
I
j vodka, but "it's those horrid com
binations thai get me."

Statistically speaking, Miss Hood
is five feet five inches and carries
her 118 pounds in 34-24-35 propor
tions.
Her wide eyes are hazel. Other
items include: nose, one; teeth,
sharp; neck, yes; and ears, possibly

■ a secret that could not be revealed
without a consultation with her hair
stylist.
Commenting on the job she has
just vacated, she says,"I think it's
great, except that they ought to
have a Stanford Sam, so us poor

little girls would have someone to
listen to. I've got a few people in
mind for the job already."
She believes that her successor
should be from Roble, "so all those
boys will go where they're needed
most."
The tradition of Stanford Sadie,
it may be added, dates from 1947,
when the program was first con
ceived. The purpose of the program
has been to drive Encina men away
from their studies and into insanity.
For some time it was broadcast at
10:30 to give Stanford women a
chance to listen, but commercial
conflicts forced a switch to the pres
ent 10 o'clock time.
Each quarter there has been a
different Sadie, coming from vari
ous walks of Stanford life and
ranging from frosh to seniors. At
the last program of each quarter,
her identity is disclosed.
And next quarter at 10 o'clock on
Monday nights a new and tempo
rarily unidentified Stanford Sadie
will again extend a mysterious
voice to KZSU listeners.


SULTRY SADIE—Mary Alice Hood, a sophomore at Stillman,
has been identified as Stanford Sadie, the lass who makes En
cina men forget all about Western Civ. KZSU announced Sa
die's true name after her final program of the guarter Monday
night. —Daily photo by Jack Byrne
The ever-mounting tension
has been relieved. The mystery
has been solved. The secret is
out. Now the Encina boys can
once more selax and settle down
to earnest work on the musty
tomes. Stanford Sadie has been
revealed.
The unabashed source of all this
uproar is a winsome little Stillman
sophomore named Mary Alice Hood,
the pro>d possessor of the only pair
of blue saddle shoes on campus. She
also answered to the name of "Mal
ice," a holdover from her career
days, when she modeled exclusive
fashions in Los Angeles under the
name of Malice A. Forethot.
She was born "long ago" (when
asked her age, she declined to an
swer, replying, "You mean mental,
physical, or the one on my ID?), but
soon overcame that handicap, and
presently graduated from South
Pasadena High School, heretofore
renowned only for producing Gar
rett and Morley. She still resides
in San Marino occasionally.
