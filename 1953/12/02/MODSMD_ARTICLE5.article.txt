## Series Concert 'Impressive' 
### BARNEY CHILDS 
The Stanford Symphony Or
chestra's concert last night in
Memorial Auditorium was a
pleasant surprise; fortunately,
this is a surprise local concert
goers are becoming more used
to with Sandor Salgo conduct
ing.
Mr. Salgo led the orchestra, made
up mostly of students, with taste
and sensitivity. The opening Mozart
symphony, K. 543 in E fiat, was par
tially hamstrung by "buck fever"
making itself felt in lack of preci
sion, tentative attack, and occasional
plain "goofs." Once the orchestra
got this of! its nerves, however, they
played impressively, especially in a
first-rate reading of a third-rate
work, Roussel's Fourth Symphony.
The Rousscl is pretty much a
pastiche and, while one cannot
help being captivated by the vary
ing orchcstrational devices and
general sonority at any given mo
ment, the overall impression is one |
of a man slightly bewildered by
the creative powers the writing of
a symphony places in his hands.
The brass section of the orchestra
was outstanding in the symphony, j
and demonstrates a crispness, pre- j
cision, and, above all, a constant j
check on power, that lends mature i
mobility and control. Doug Peterson
played the demanding trumpet solo
lines with the same surcness and ac
curacy that characterized the whole
section.
Soprano Ruth Roehr appeared
after the intermission in three of J
Berlioz' songs from the cycle Los
nuits d'ete. Miss Roehr, now with j
the San Francisco Opera Company j
after her graduation from Stanford j
last. June, will be remembered for
her impressive performance in Vcr- I
di's FalstalT last spring.
The songs arc designed to set the j
voice oIT to maximum advantage: j
Berlioz' orchestration of devices
that become stereotypes in later
"lieder" brings a transluccncc of
sound and a deft movement of so
' nority that the orchestra seemed
, at home with. Praise of iVliss
J Roehr's warm and fluent voice
merely adds to the deserved en
thusiasm critics have shown for
her previous performances.
Berlioz' Roman Carnival Overture
concluded the program, demonstrat
ing what the orchestra can do when
it relaxes; under Mr. Salgo's infec
tious enthusiasm, they gave their
j best. By spring quarter they should
| be one of the best university orchcs
; tras in the West.
