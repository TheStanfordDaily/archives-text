# LONGSHOREMEN STRIKE TODAY
## Seven Refuse to Testify At Fiery Velde Hearing 
### SUE WHEAT Managing Editor, The Daily 
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 2 —Tempers flared in the City Hall here
today as seven "unwilling" witnesses appearing before Harold
Velde's House Un-American Activities Committee, refused to
testify.
They were a few of the scores of citizens who have been sub-

poenaed by the investigators to
testify before the committee through
out the week. Today was the second
day of testimony.
More serious fireworks arc ex
pected tomorrow when men of Local
10 of the International Longshore
men's and Warehousemen's Union
on a "stop ■work" order are expcctcd
to picket City Hall in protest of the
House Committee's hearing.
Today's flare-up came when 43-
ycar-old George Van Frederick
told the committee "I feel my po
litical convictions arc my own
business" and that 'he felt he
should be free "to he a member of
any organization without inter
rogation or intimidation."
Upon this remark there was clap
ping in the room and acting Com
mittee chairman Donald L. Jack
son (R-Calif.) banging the gavel,
angrily warned the over-flow audi
ence against "further demonstrations
cither of approval or disapproval."
Frederick, a former draftsman for
the Bechtel Corporation, said that
he had been fired after he had re
ceived the committee's subpoena
and asked the committee, "Are you
going to get me my job back?"
Jackson, interrupting the witness'
outbreak, retorted: "Arc you going
to cooperate with the Committee?"
Frederick was counseled by Rich
ard Gladstein, San Francisco law
yer.
Also called to testify today was
John W. Mass, 42-year-old in
structor at City College of San
Francisco. Mass, who had previ
ously admitted membership in the
Communist Party from 1947 to
1949, refused to tell the Committee
what he knew about Communist
activity in the teaching profes
sion.
Advised by Lawrence Speiser,
counsel for the American Civil Lib
erties Union, he cited the Fifth
Amendment as his basis for refusal
to answer. To questions pertaining
to Communist activity he replied:
"I do not wish to be a witness
against myself."
Most silent witness of the day
was Roy Hudson, unemployed
house painter who declined to an
swer almost every question put to
him. (This reporter tallied 58 re
fusals to answer from Hudson.)
Hudson was counseled by San
Francisco attorney George Ander
sen.
According to a report of previous
evidence read by the Committee
counsel Robert L. Kunzig, Hudson
held numerous important party po
sions between 1934 and 1948.
/'Friendly witness" to the Com
mittee was Dickson Hill, who with
his wife had joined the Communist
party as an FBI undercover agent
between 1945 and 1949.
Hill outlined in detail the or
ganization of the party in Ala
meda County. In testimony last
ing almost four hours, Hill named
and identified over 50 persons he
knew as party members during
his time as a Communist.
Witnesses following Hill to the
stand were persons named by him
as Communists during 1945-1949.
Committee members would not
say who tomorrow's witnesses
would be, though Jackson hinted
that one would be "a former mem
ber of the Bay Area Fourth Estate."
Tomorrow's hearing will begin at
9:30 a.m. in the Board of Super-,
visors chambcr in the City Hall. Al
though the room scats only 300 and
has been crowded for all sessions,
scats may be obtained after a half
hour wait in line.

Amendment as his basis for refusal
to answer. To questions pertaining
to Communist activity he replied:
"I do not wish to be a witness
against myself."
Most silent witness of the day
was Roy Hudson, unemployed
house painter who declined to an
swer almost every question put to
him. (This reporter tallied 58 re
fusals to answer from Hudson.)
Hudson was counseled by San
Francisco attorney George Ander
sen.
According to a report of previous
evidence read by the Committee
counsel Robert L. Kunzig, Hudson
held numerous important party po
sions between 1934 and 1948.
/'Friendly witness" to the Com
mittee was Dickson Hill, who with
his wife had joined the Communist
party as an FBI undercover agent
between 1945 and 1949.
Hill outlined in detail the or
ganization of the party in Ala
meda County. In testimony last
ing almost four hours, Hill named
and identified over 50 persons he
knew as party members during
his time as a Communist.
Witnesses following Hill to the
stand were persons named by him
as Communists during 1945-1949.
Committee members would not
say who tomorrow's witnesses
would be, though Jackson hinted
that one would be "a former mem
ber of the Bay Area Fourth Estate."
Tomorrow's hearing will begin at
9:30 a.m. in the Board of Super-,

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 2 —Tempers flared in the City Hall here
today as seven "unwilling" witnesses appearing before Harold
Velde's House Un-American Activities Committee, refused to
testify.
They were a few of the scores of citizens who have been sub-

poenaed by the investigators to
testify before the committee through
out the week. Today was the second
day of testimony.
More serious fireworks arc ex
pected tomorrow when men of Local
10 of the International Longshore
men's and Warehousemen's Union
on a "stop ■work" order are expcctcd
to picket City Hall in protest of the
House Committee's hearing.
Today's flare-up came when 43-
ycar-old George Van Frederick
told the committee "I feel my po
litical convictions arc my own
business" and that 'he felt he
should be free "to he a member of
any organization without inter
rogation or intimidation."
Upon this remark there was clap
ping in the room and acting Com
mittee chairman Donald L. Jack
son (R-Calif.) banging the gavel,
angrily warned the over-flow audi
ence against "further demonstrations
cither of approval or disapproval."
Frederick, a former draftsman for
the Bechtel Corporation, said that
he had been fired after he had re
ceived the committee's subpoena
and asked the committee, "Are you
going to get me my job back?"
Jackson, interrupting the witness'
outbreak, retorted: "Arc you going
to cooperate with the Committee?"
Frederick was counseled by Rich
ard Gladstein, San Francisco law
yer.
Also called to testify today was
John W. Mass, 42-year-old in
structor at City College of San
Francisco. Mass, who had previ
ously admitted membership in the
Communist Party from 1947 to
1949, refused to tell the Committee
what he knew about Communist
activity in the teaching profes
sion.
Advised by Lawrence Speiser,
counsel for the American Civil Lib
erties Union, he cited the Fifth
