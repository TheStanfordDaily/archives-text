# Teacher May Lose Job For Not Testifying

### BOB REZAK HADLEY ROFF 
John W. Mass, the 42-year-old
City College of San Francisco Eng
lish instructor who refused to tes
tify yesterday before the House
Un-American Activities Committee
meeting in San Francisco, faces a
possibility of being fired from his
job, S.F. school authorities declared.
Dr. Herbert C. Clish, superin
tendent of schools, said he would
immediately send Mass, who re
fused to answer questions on the
basis of the Fiftli Amendment, a
special delivery registered letter di
recting him to stay away from his
classes.'
"This is not a suspension,"
Clish explained. "We can't do
that."
The superintendent, who sal
through the committee's interro
gation of Mass, said that he would
call a special meeting of the
Board of Education at the "ear
liest possible time" to discuss the
instructor's future status.
Irving H. Breyer, legal adviser for
for S.F. schools, said that Mass
probably would be dismissed on the
grounds of "unprofessional conduct
and evident unfitness for service."
Breyer said that Mass's refusal to
testify is a violation of a California
state law which, he said, requires
that state employees "answer per
tinent questions, concerning pos
sible Communistic affiliation, which
arc asked by un-American activities
committees, Congress, or the Legis
lature."
Mass signed a loyalty oath at City
College in 1951, but wrote a nota
tion on the oath explaining that he
was a member of the Communist
party from 1947 to 1949. He said on
the oath that he is not now a mem
ber of that or any other subversive
group.
The tired, worried instructor soft
ly told reporters that "fear of in
crimination of others" was part of
the reason he refused to testify.
"What I might have to say

about Communism wouldn't mat
ter one way or the other," Mass
added. "Frankly I feel that the
committee must be scraping the
bottom of the barrel when they
got to me."
"As you can imagine," he said,
"this lias been a pretty trying af
fair."
When asked if he had been sub
jected to pressures of any kind, he
answered with a drawn-out "No."
"If people don't talk to me I don't
take it as a personal affront. I think
they are merely afraid," he de
clared.
