A new science quadrangle, a new fine arts quad around Me

men to 48 per cent, of the entire
University at most, he said.
The Provost explained the "un
fortunate rise in tuition" as neces
sary because of cost-of-living finan
cial pressure. Less than 41? per cent
of University expenses are paid by
tuition, he said. Interestingly enongh
no tuition was chargcd during the
first 24 years of Stanford's existence,
he added. The endowment of
$21,000,000 completely supported the
school.
Although the present endow
ment exceeds $1.1,000,000. expenses
have far more than doubled. Dr.
Whitaker told the Branncr women.
Steps which have been taken to
help meet the financial dcficit arc
the tuition raise, an extensive land
development project, and an in
creased gift program, the Provost
continued.
Stanford's initial grant included
two-fifths of the Monterey Penin

Sterling's capacity in the latter's ab

the Provost, and moderated the dis

"We arc fostering marriages
where women are smarter than
their husbands," Dr. Whitaker
laughingly remarked, going on to
explain that entrance require
ments at Stanford are necessarily
stilTcr for women students, since
fewer can be admitted.
However. Stanford will have more
women students, Dr. Whitaker said,
as soon as living accomodations for
them arc available. In the charter,
the University was originally plan
ned by Mrs. Lei and Stanford to have
no more than 500 women students, •
he explained, adding that at this !
time total school size was less than I
