# Stanford May Be Site for Hospital
## 
### 
Veterans Administration field
men, who arc currently searching
the mid-Peninsula for a site for a
new 1,000 - bed ncuropsychiatric
hospital, visited the Stanford cam
pus last week, it was announced
yesterday.
The University has 5,000 acres of
land west of El Camino Ileal avail
able for leasing.
Congressman William S. Mailliard
of San Francisco announced Tues
day that the new hospital will not
be built at Ft. Funston near San
Francisco as originally planned. The
site i.s too close to the center of the
San Francisco atomic bomb target
area, he said.
Mailliard said the hospital will
definitely be constructed in the Bay
Area, "probably cither north of San
Rafael or south of San Mateo."
According to informed specula
tion the location of the hospital in
the Palo Alto area would permit it
to be administered jointly with a
1,400-bcd hospital in Menlo Park.
A second argument in favor of
choosing a site near here is that
a pool of psychiatric experts will
be available when the University
moves its medical school and hos
pital to the campus.
