# Eisenhower Backs Dulles' Stand In McCarthy Foreign Policy Row
## Ike Says Fear of Reds Will Not Be Issue in 1954 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 (UP)—President Eisenhower threw his
weight behind Secretary of State John Foster Dulles' criticism
ol Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy today and declared anew that "fear
of Communists" in government will not be a 1954 political issue.
Like Dulles, Eisenhower did not mention McCarthy by name.

'But the President told a news con
ference he is "in full accord with
the statement made yesterday by
Secretary Dulles."
Dulles had asserted that criti
cism such as that fired by McCar
thy attacks "the very heart o£
United States foreign policy."
McCarthy was handed a copy of
the President's statement in the
Senate Office Building. He com
mented to newsmen:
"Perhaps I will wait and give out
a statement tomorrow morning."
He said he would probably read
it over television.
Included in Eisenhower's state
ment was the remark that if the
United States "should turn impa
tiently to coercion of other free
nations, our brand of coercion, as
far as our friends arc concerncd,
would be the mark of the impe
rialist rather than of the leader."
He said that American military
and economic aid was a part of this
country's own security program and
added:
"We do this because unity among
free nations is our only hope for
survival in the face of the world
wide Soviet conspiracy backed by
the weight of Soviet military power."
Eisenhower predicted the main is
sue in next year's battle for control
of the narrowly-divided Congress
will be whether or not the Republi
cans push through a "progressive,
dynamic program." ff the GOP fails
in this, he said, "it does not deserve
to remain in power."
"I am convinced thai those who
Ifight for the program that I shall
soon submit to the Congress will
deserve and will receive the re
spect and support of the American
people," the President added.
At the same time, however, Mr.
Eisenhower made clear he expect;,
his administration's success or fail -
ure in weeding out Communists to
be an issue next November. He said
he hoped the voters will wish "to
commend the efficiency of this ad
ministration in eliminating this
menace."
The President laid down his po
sition in a 600-word statement which
he read in solemn tones at the start
of his news conference. Both at the
beginning and end he stated flatly
that the prepared remarks would
be all he had to say on the subject.

of Communists" in government will not be a 1954 political issue.
Like Dulles, Eisenhower did not mention McCarthy by name.

Secretary Dulles."
Dulles had asserted that criti

United States foreign policy."
McCarthy was handed a copy of
the President's statement in the
Senate Office Building. He com
mented to newsmen:

nations, our brand of coercion, as
far as our friends arc concerncd,
