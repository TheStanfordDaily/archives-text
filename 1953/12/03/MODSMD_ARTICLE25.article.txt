# The 						Administration and McCarthy
## 
### 
Although neither Secretary of State Dulles
nor President Eisenhower used McCarthy's
name, there is no guestion that they have at
tacked the Wisconsin Senator for his criticism
of the administration's foreign policy.
Essentially, McCarthy's criticism was based
on the pietext that the State Department and the
administration have not exerted enough pres
sure on the Western nations to comply with
the aims and policies of the United States.
And essentially, DuHes, with Eisenhower's
solid approval, har. said that the U.S. should
not use its powerful position to coerce its allies
into policies con. y to their own, that our
power "should not blur our dedication to the
truths, expressed in the Declaration of Inde
pendence, that we owe a respect to the opin
ion« of others."
We are relieved that the administration
has defended its foreign policy against what
we believe to be an unjust criticism of "the
very heart" of that foreign policy.
And wo also feel a deeper relief, a relief of
skepticism of the relative strength of purpose
of Senator McCarthy and the Eisenhower ad
ministration.

Dulles' rebuttal to McCarthy's speech of last
week was the first time the administration had
obviously and publicly disagreed with Sena
tor McCarthy. And Eisenhower's statement
yesterday that Communism in government
would not be an issue in the 1954 elections
strengthened that public disagreement.
Our respect for President Eisenhower and
his administration has been increased. We
are no longer skeptical of the President's
strength of conviction and courage to stand
up for that conviction in the fact of criticism.
And we are no longer intensely afraid that
McCarthy's political power might become
unlimited, a possibility that existed when the
administration kept guiet on McCarthy's
mouthings or gave blanket endorsement to
all Republicans.
We hope that such strength of purpose as
expressed by Eisenhower and Dulles this week
will continue to be heard in the future. We
hope that they will continue to voice disap
proval <3f McCarthy at the appropriate and nec
essary times.
Those times will be numerous in the months
leading to the 1954 and 1956 elections.—Win
