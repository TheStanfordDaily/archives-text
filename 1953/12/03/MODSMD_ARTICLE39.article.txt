# Zete II's Win Intramural Grid Championship, 19-6
## 
### BOB DURAND 
The Zete II gridders are today the newly-crowned intramural
football champions by virtue of a decisive 19-6 victory over the
Kappa Alpha's on the Frosh field yesterday.
Sparked by a flashy passing attack and a consistently hard
hitting defense, the Zetes dominated the entire game with the
exception of the first three minutes*

of the second half when the losers
scored their only touchdown.
All three of the winners' mark
ers were scored through the air
with star tailback .John Forbush
on the throwing end each time.
The first dx-pointer came early
in the game, climaxing a long
drive when Forbush tossed a
nine-yard bullet into the arms of
Jack Callahan in the end zone.
After several ball exchanges, the
Zetes again scored when Forbush
threw a flat pass to Jack Randolph
who ou traced the KA secondary
and dashed 4(1 yards to make the
count 12-0. The final touchdown
came late in the game after the
KA's had been forced to punt out
to their own 40-yard line. The next
play, Forbush threw to Carl
"Monk" Metten on the 20-yard line;
this was immediately followed by
an aerial to Ray Silliman who
stepped out of bounds on the one
yard line. Two plays later, Metten
took a Forbush jump pass over the
center of the line for the score.
The extra point was added on a pass

to Randolph.
The losers' lone tally came
three minutes after the second
half opened. After taking the
kickoff, KA marched (>() yards in
six plays with the passing com
bination of Dick Hall to John
Packard holding the spotlight.
Packard scored when he grabbed
j a Hall aerial in the end zone on a
play good for .'{() yards.
After the Zetes had made their |
first two touchdowns, the KA line,
led by Fritz Huntsinger, Packard, (
and Dave Davis, began to bear
down and stop the powerful Zete !
attack. On one occasion, the win- â– 
ners were thrown for a ten-yard j
: loss on two consecutive plays. In j
| the second half, it was Huntsinger (
and Lenney Foote sparking the KA
line but to no avail.
The usually accurate Hall was
hindered by an alert Zete pass de
fense. Three times when the KA
attack began to click, the ball was
| intercepted by the green - shirted I
Zetes. Bob Burton, Forbush, and
i Metten all accounted for thefts of j
Hall's aerials.
The Zetes pulled a bit of trick
ery on the last play of the game.
While the center and the quar
terback remained in their usual
positions, the rest of the team
went to the other side of the field,
momentarily stumping the KA
defense. The play was foiled,
however, when Packard rushed in
to tag Forbush before a pass
could develop.
The winning of the championship
; by the Zetes marked the end of the
reign oi the Phi Kaps, who had led :
the leagues lor the last two years. !
