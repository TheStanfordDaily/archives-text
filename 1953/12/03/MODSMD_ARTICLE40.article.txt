THAR SHE GOES!—Gus Chavalas, '50, gets away a long shot
for the Alumni team in Tuesday night's game with the Stanford
Varsity. This particular shot was wide of the mark, as were a
good many of the alum's attempts. They averaged only 23
per cent on their floor shooting, which cost them the game,
69-56. Watching Chavalas on his shot are Ron Tomsic (4), Oleg
Suzdaleff (6), and Carlos Bea. —Daily photo by Frank Huntress
