Boh Meyers, former Stanford
football star, and a fullback on the
1952 Indian Rose Bowl team, is
turning into a one-man offense for
the Quantico Marines eleven this
season.
A few weeks back. Bob booted a
field goal with two seconds left in
the first half to give the Marines a
3 to 0 win over Camp Lee, and on
Thanksgiving Day he tallied 14
points to pace Quantico to a 28 to 7
victory over Fort Belvoir. The win
gave the Marines the Eastern Serv
ice football championship.
Ail Bob did against Belvoir was
score a touchdown on a spectacular
47-yard sprint, kick two field goals
and two extra points, and put on a
brilliant punting exhibition.
Bob will return to the West Coast
this month when Quantico plays
Fort Ord in the Poinsettia Bowl
game which will determine the
National Service football champion
ship. The game will be played in
San Diego on Dec. 19.
Harry Hit gas i an, who also
played with Meyers in the same
backfield on that 1951 Stanford
team, helped Hamilton Field to
the San Francisco Bay Area
Armed Forces championship last
week as the Defenders walloped
the Presidio 54 to 0. Hugasian
scored one touchdown and hooted
two extra points.
Still another alumnus from that
1952 team, Ail-American end Bill
McColl, is proving to be one of the
blight spots in the Chicago Bears'
rather dismal season this fall.
Bill, who is pursuing his medical
degree at Northwestern when he
isn't cavorting on the gridiron, is
one of the leading pass catchers in
the Nalional Football League with
33 receptions for 414 yards and four
touchdowns. A few weeks ago Mc-
Coll caught a 55-yard touchdown
pass against the Detroit Lions, and
last Sunday scored again against the
L.A. Rams.

We have some tragic news to
report about Brynhild (.rasmoen,
champion skier who graduated
from the Farm last year.
Brynhild, who was a member
of the United States Olympic ski
team in 194 X. is still in critical
condition in a Flagstaff, Arizona,
hospital after being in a serious
autoinoble accident. She suffered
head injuries when a pickup
truck she was driving went out
of control and overturned three
times.
Miss Grasmoen had been at
tending postgraduate classes at

Arizona Slate College at Flagstaff
and was living with an uncle who
operated a ski resort in Arizona.
We sincerely hope thai she re
covers soon, for Brynhild was one
of the finest women athletes ever
to attend Stanford.

Track and field are a little out o£
season right now, but an article we
saw the other day is still pretty
timely. It listed records of college
athletes in open competition during
1953, and from what we read, i*
seems that Stanford athletes came
out pretty well.
For instance, Bob Mathias was
tied for sixth in the high hurdles
and tied for ninth in the lows, while
Jerry Wood, who is back for an
other year in 1954, was tied for
eleventh in the highs.
In the field events, Howard Hertz
came forth with the sixth best shot
put in the U.S. in 1953, a toss of
nearly 55 feet, while Mathias took
down ninth in the discus and Chuck
Renfro was tenth best in the platter
throw.
Stanford came out well in the
| javelin, as Leo Long was eleventh,
Bob Kimball was fourteenth, and
Chuck Harlow wound up with the
twenty-filth best spear toss in the
nation.
' A couple of Card alumni did all
right too, especially Bud Held,
who is now competing for the
Olympic Club. Bud established a
new world's record for the javelin
last summer with a throw of 2G3
ft. 10 in., which of course was the
finest toss in the U.S.
Otis Chandler, also with the
[ Olympic Club, finished seventh best
! in the shot put.
