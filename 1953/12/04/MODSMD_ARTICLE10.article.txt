## 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
The organization, problems, and components of the French
Union were discussed last night by Louis de Giuringaud, French
consul-general in San Francisco, who officially opened the three
day Institute of International Relations conference on "Colonial
ism: Challenge to American Foreign Policy."
The French Union, which was established at the end of World

War 11, is composed of the French*
republic and associated states and
territories.
As is stated in the preamble to
the constitution which established
the French Union, its purpose was
to enable each territory to
develop along democratic lines
while being linked to France by
common interests, tradition, and
common governing organs, de
Guiringaud explained.
Discussing France's role in the
granting of independence to the
components of the Union, de Gui- !
ringaud said that it would be a j
"grave and unpardonable error" to
let states set themselves up as de- ;
mocracies before they are ready to
bear the responsibility that this
step entails.
Premature granting of independ
ence, ho claimed, "would lead to ;
chaos, misery, and an open invita- |
tion to the totalitarianism enemy j
which we must fight together if we
are to win peace and freedom in
this world."
In its government of its states
and territories, the French con
sul-general stated, France has en
deavored to improve local condi
tions and natural resources, put- j
ting much time and money into j
these projects.
Results of Franco's efforts in this j
direction become apparent in the
statistics of total production in the !
various territories, he said. The j
total production of Algeria, for ex
ample, has gone up seven times ,
since the French took over, he j
added.
De Guiringaud was introduced by
Norm Sweet, president of lIR. Also
speaking to the delegates and stu
dents assembled in Cubberley was
Don Lozabnick, ASSU president.
