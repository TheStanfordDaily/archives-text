That is the job of educators and

"There is not a college student in
the land who isn't a target for Marx
ist persuasion if that student has re
jected the old adult world and is
filled with doubts and suspicions
about the state of world affairs—po
litical, economic, and social. If that
student is of a questioning nature
and if he can't find . . . adequate
answers to those questions ... he
may become grist in the Communist
propaganda mill."
