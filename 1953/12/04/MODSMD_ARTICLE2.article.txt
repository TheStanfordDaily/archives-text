# McCARTHY STATEMENT
## To Back Stand on China 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 (UP)—Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy, un
daunted by sharp Administration rebukes, called today on all
Americans who "feel as I do" to write President Eisenhower de
manding an end to U.S. aid to nations trading with Red China.
Some 5V2 hours after McCarthy urged the public to write to Mr.

Eisenhower, the White House said*
it. had received nine telegrams sent I
in response to the Senator's appeal, j
The Wisconsin Republican said he
is "in complete disagreement" with |
Secretary of State John Foster Dul- I
les, who said the United States
never will try to "coerce" its allies
into following its policies because it j
is not interested in acquiring "satel- '
litcs" in the Russian manner. Mr. |
Eisenhower announced he is in "full 1
accord" with Dulles.
McCarthy, who is thought by j
some to have White House ambi
tions, said it is "ridiculous and un
true" that he is seeking to wrest
away Mr. Eisenhower's leadership I
as "has been suggested by our po- i
litical enemies." But he said he will i
insist on his right to criticize when
warranted.
McCarthy said no man cam- j
paigned harder for Mr. Eisenhower 1
than he did. He also pledged his |
"utmost support" to the Republican |
party in future political wars, but;
said this docs not mean he "will re- J
frain from criticizing my party j
when I think it is making mistakes." 1
The State Department had "no
comment" on McCarthy's statement. !
It thus stood on Dulles' earlier j
charge that McCarthy was attacking j
"the very heart of U.S. foreign pol
icy."
