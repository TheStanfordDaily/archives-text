# Let's Preserve the Fifth Amendment
## 
### 
One of the members of the Velde Committee
which is now investigating Communist activi
ties, in the Bay Area said Tuesday that he fav
ored legislation to keep witnesses from dodg
ing behind the Fifth Amendment.
He suggested laws granting a witness im
munity from prosecution for testimony given
before a congressional committee.
If such legislation, already suggested by
Attorney General Herbc.i Brownell, and now
under study in the Senate, is passed, any
witness who refused to testify before a con
gressional committee could be cited for con
tempt of Congress, fined heavily, and sent to
jail.
We strongly question the wisdom of such
legislation.
Practically speaking, we wonder how the
federal government could grant immunity
from prosecution hy <~tate courts under state
anti-Communist laws, many of which are
stronger than present federal laws.
Still being practical, ,ye do not believe that
Ihe congressional grax. ring of immunity would
really help the witness. Maybe the evidence

given before the commiitee could not be used
directly to send him to jail. But once he v/as
forced lo testify about hia illegal activities, it
would be easy for an alert prosecuting attor
ney to corroborate that information through
other sources. In effect, the witness would
still be putting his own neck in the noose.
And that brings us to our strongest ob
jection to the legislation. The Fifth Amend
ment was written into the Constitution over
175 years ago for a veiy real reason. Most
of us do not believe that a criminal should
have to send himself to jail. That sort of pro
cedure smacks toe much of trial by ordeal
and the inguisition for our liking.
Legally the legislation under consideration
might be able to help us to get around the pro
visions of the Constitution.
Bui morally we'd have to face the fact that
we were denying the citizen his basic right
not to have to testify against himself. Morally
we'd have to admit that we were denying, pos
sibly in a moment of unthinking panic, a pro
tection which has stood unchallenged for 175
years. Barbara Tuerk
