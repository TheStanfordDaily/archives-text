# Shut Up!
## 
### 
At its last meeting of the quarter on Wed
nesday night, 4 he Executive Com uttee dis
cussed a probl> -n appropriate to the current
temper of the campus, a temper of conscien
tious study and a frantic feeling of "My God, it's
dead week!"
The problem was brought to the attention
of Excom member Guy Shoup by several stu
dents and was forwarded by Shoup to Excom
for.its consideration.
The students said that the lobby outside the
Reserve Book Room in the Main Library some

times becomes so noisy during evening hours
that a cacaphony of shouts and laughter seeps
into the contemplative atmosphere of the RBR.
This, said the students, makes it hard to study.
Excom agreed. We agree.
But rather than initiate a rule to send the
noisy conversationalists out of the lobby and
into the cold and dark night for their study
breaks, we would suggest that those students
comply with the following request:
Confine the talk and laughter to a volume
below that of a roar. â€”Win Griffith
