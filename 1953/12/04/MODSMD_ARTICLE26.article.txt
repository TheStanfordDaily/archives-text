### PETE GROTHE 
TRIBUTE ij'O AN ATHLETE
A tall, muscular senior will take his last finals in a
f< w weeks, gulp down his last -up of Cellar coffee,
yruty hio degree, and leave the Quad for the last time
as a student.
11l name is Bub Mathias, and hr> not mlv tV>f>

best athlete Stanford has ever
had; he is presently regarded as
11 greatest athlete. And
although he is only 23, he is right
now being mentioned in the same
reverent tones usually reserved
lot- Babe Ruth. Jim Thorpe, Red
Grange, and Tv Cobb.
I would cpnside. it a sin of om-
Ms;Jon on my part if I let the soft
spoken Tulare resident escape
from our midst \vithout a resume
of h» last four years.

I remember Bob when he first moved into room
.'■ol Encina. A year before he had captured the Olym
pic Decathlon ti-tle at the pink-cheeked age of 17—
j till a high schooler. He matriculated as the most
la mo us freshman to enter Stanford, and some cynics
scoffed that he was over-rated, that although he was
a champion in the decathlon, he couldn't hold up
under individual competition.
I remember when i:c turned in the most electri
fying performance that freshman track has ever
witnessed—when he took five firsts and one sec
ond against the Californir 'rosh to score 28 points.
I remember tin three years that he put in for
Coach Jack Weiershauser's varsity, consistently
taking fiists in the discus, high hurdles, low hurdles,
and dabbling in the shot put, high jump, pole vault,
javelin, broad jump, and relay.
I remember when he stepped in at fullback on the
Rose Bovl team with only three weeks practice
and scored four touchdowns in the fust two games,

and how he bowled over opposition tacklers with
his long, powerful strides.
I remember that smoggy day in the packed Los
Angeles Coliseum when Mathias ?cooped up a South
ern California kick-off on the four yard line and
churned 96 yards goalward to defeat previously un
beaten Troy. And I can't help but reflect with con
siderable agony what our team might have done
this year with Mathias in the backfield.
Most vividly of all, I remember Bob turning in
the most splendid individual athletic performance
I have ever seen—at the 1952 Olympic Games at
Helsinki in the ten-event decathlon, the most
gruelling of all athletic events. This was to be his
last decathlon competition, and he had set a goal
for himself of breaking tlie records.
Consider the obstacles that Mathias had to over
come to do this. The facilities for the decathlon at
Helsinki were bad, so it had to be run off for 24
hours over a two day span, much longer than normal.
Further, Bob had incurred a muscle pull in his left
leg in the third event and it. pained him to lift his
leg in the running and jumping events.
With three events to go, he had to register his best
all-time marks in these events to accomplish his goal.
Dog-tired and injured, he pole vaulted 13 feet, 1%
inches, winged the javelin 195 feet, 3 1 / a inches, and
ran the 1,500 meters in 4:55. Those marks were his
three all time bests, so he broke the records. One
athlete out of a thousand could have turned in that
Herculean feat, and Tulare Bob was that one.
But I not only remember the six-three, 210 pound
work-horse wonder as the world's most splendid
athlete. I also remember him as one who never
wanted himself considered as anything but "just
another student." A' cue who was modest on the
point of being shy. And as one who had humani
tarian ideals and \\ s devoted to helping in youth
work.
Bob Mathias graduates at the end of this quarter.
He has borne his fame well.
