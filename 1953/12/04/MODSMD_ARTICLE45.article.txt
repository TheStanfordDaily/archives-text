# Indian Booters Play 'Big Game'
## 
### 
Tomorrow's the day. Tomorrow is
the big game lor the Stanford soc
cer varsity. At 2 p.m. the booters
take on the mighty University of
San Francisco, with no less than the
league championship at stake, on the
Don's home field.
If the Indians win tomorrow,
Stanford and USF will end up in
a tie for the championship of the
Northern California intercollegi
ate Soccer Association. A play-off
game would he played Monday.
Coach Leo Weinstein's men have_
their work cut out for them. USF,
the perennial champions of Western
soccer, has a string of 55 gariies with
out a defeat in league play.
But the Indians, if they continue
to play like they have in the sec
ond half of league play (they are
undefeated in their last four
games), have a good chance of up
setting the vaunted Ililltoppers.
The Stanford defense poses no
problem, except for the USF for
wards. All season long, the Indian
backs have performed in stalwart
fashion. All-league fullback John
Sentous and co-caplain and center
half-back Derek Lieety, lead what is
probably the league's strongest de
fensive outfit.
The defense will have to keep a
sharp eye on the several elusive Don
forwards. The likes of Brian Pike,
A 1 Rangel, and Manny Ortiz, are
are among the most dangerous line
men on the Pacific Coast.
Last Wednesday night, in a meet
ing of the league's coaches, John
Sentous and Sam, Suarez received
first string all-league honors. Derek
Lieety, Niels Vinding, and Dick
Koenigsbergei\ were named to the
second string.
