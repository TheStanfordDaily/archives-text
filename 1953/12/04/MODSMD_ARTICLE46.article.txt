# Garrett-Morley Make AP Team
## 
### 
Sam Morley, the slender Stanford
end from Pasadena, was selected
last night to the Associated, All
American team.
Bob (iarrett, Morley's high
school and college teammate, was
chosen on the second team, and
end John Steinberg received hon
orable mention All-American.
The Associated Press team is con
sidered by many experts to be the
truest All-American team, since the
AP doesn't select the squad in the
middle of the season, like a lot of
magazines do.
Morley, a 188 pound, six-one sen
ior, is a history major.
Garrett will be among those
honored tonight at the oilicial ban
quet at Leone's Restaurant in New
York where awards to players
selected on the Look Magazine
All-American team will be pre
sented. Each player will receive
an engraved Honor Award watch.
The banquet ceremony will be
broadcast coast-to-coast and will
be heard in the Bay area at 7:35
p.m. on KC'BS.
