By now, all the grid equipment has been .stored away until next year.
And so, before we forget about football altogether, just one parting word.
Chuck Taylor said after the season was 10 minutes over, "This is the
greatest team I have ever coached—maybe not from the point of view of
personnel, but from the standpoint of spirit and determination."
Taylor, whom I wouldn't trade for any other coach in the nation, thu;;

paid the perfect tribute to the 1952 Stanford football
team. Consider the first game of the year, when Stan
ford looked like a YMCA team in Lost Hock, Arizona in
losing to COP. And then consider that the Indians
came within one conversion (against USC) of going to
the Rose Bowl. The margin oj a toe isn't very big.
And. yet, so big.
The experts picked lis fifth behind UCLA, USC, Cal,
and Washington. Yet, the Rose Bowl race wasn't de
cided until the very last game.
The turning point, curiously enough, was a loss—
the one to Illinois. It was at this juncture that the

! Indians fcit their muscles Hex and they knew they could do big things.
Bob Garrett, who only threw three passes in the second game of the
season against Oregon (and completed one), discovered that he bad an
extraordinarily-gifted arm. And with the aid of Sam IVlorley, John
Steinberg, Hon Cook, and an air-tight protective cup, he passed like
no one ever has before at Stanford and provided Slanfurd partisans wi'ai
one of their most interesting, wide-open football sea ons.
It was Garrett who gave the team the lii't it need* J, and it' was' guards
Norm Manoogian and Phil Wilson who held the team together. It' th?y
gave awards for trying, Manoog and Wilson would win them hands down.
Whenever things looked darkest it was Stanford's two guards who came
through with the crucial tackle that stopped or the block that counted
and the chatter that pepped up the rest of the team.
And so, several Hoover Tower fulls of orchids to the coaches and 1953
Cinderella Kids.

Although the Cards won't be in the Rose IJowl, those lucky enough to
hold Shrine Last-West Game tickets may see a Stanford show. Chuck
Taylor is head coach of the West team and has seen la il that All-Ameri
