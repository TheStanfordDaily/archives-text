### PHIL BERMAN 
Stanford's baskotballcys, with an Alumni scalp already on their
belt, meet their first collegiate opponent of the season tonight
and tomorrow when they face the University of Washington at
Seattle's Ilec Edmundson Pavilion.
After this cair of cames with the Huskies, Bob Burnett's caaers

will lay ofT two weeks for finals and i
ihen resume action against the Uni- j
versity of Hawaii at the Pavilion
Dec. 19.
The clash with the Rainbows, |
who whipped the Cards last sea
son in the Islands, is the first of •
six home ftames during the j
Christmas holidays for the In- j
dians.
On Dec.' 21, Stanford will play '
Loyola of Los Angeles; Dec. 22, host
Fresno State; Dec. 28, battle with
OP; Dec. 30, face Oregon; and on
'r.n. 2, play St. Mary's in their la c t
t before opening the conference
cason. All the games will start at
J p.m.
This weekend's games with
Wa hington will find the Indians !
meeting the e'efending Pacific !
Coast Conference champion as I
well as the number three team in
the 1953 NCAA tourney. The
Huskies compiled a 28 and 3 won
and lost record in 1952-53.
This season, however, Coach Tip- j
py Dye is faced with a tremendous i
rebuilding problem since Washing- j
ton lost its entire starting team, in- j
eluding All-American Bob "Hooks"
Houbregs, who scored 846 points j
last year.
With only a few second-stringers i
from last season's squad, Dye has |
indicated that he may go with a
two - platoon system against the j
Cards this weekend.
"I doubt if any five of our men
are better than the next five," he
said recently.
Top man among the returnees is j
center Dean Parsons, a 6-ft. 7-in. j
225 - pounder. Parsons was the
"sixth man" for the Huskies last <
season.
Parsons is not rated a great scor- j
er, but he is big, rugged, and will- I
ing, and considered a demon on the i
backboards as well as a fine defen- j
sive man.
At the; forwards for Washing
lon will be team captain Don
Tripp and sophomore Karl Voegt- j
lin. Tripp saw considerable action
last year, until an injury put him j
out of action midway through the J
season.
Rounding out the Huskies' start
ing live are Roland Halle and Jerry ;
Johnson, both up from the jayvees.
Coshow, who stands 6 ft. 6 in., j
has been making a strong bid for
the center spot during prc-season
practice, mainly on the strength of
an accurate hook shot, which he
throws either left- or right-hand- j
ed.
Monroe, who starred on the grid- j
irorl as well as the court as a frosh,
missed the entire 1953 football sea
son because of a broken hand suf
fered in the opening game.
Reserves most likely to see ac
tion this week end are Carlos Bea, j
forward; Barry Brown, forward; Leo
Schwaiger, center; Dave Epperson,
forward; Bill Turner, guard; Ron
Wagner, guard; and Jim Johnson,;
guard.
Following are the probable start- i
ing lineups lor this weekend's I
games

"sixth man" for the Huskies last <
season.
Parsons is not rated a great scor- j
er, but he is big, rugged, and will- I
ing, and considered a demon on the i
backboards as well as a fine defen- j
sive man.
At the; forwards for Washing
lon will be team captain Don
Tripp and sophomore Karl Voegt- j
lin. Tripp saw considerable action
last year, until an injury put him j
out of action midway through the J
season.
Rounding out the Huskies' start
ing live are Roland Halle and Jerry ;
Johnson, both up from the jayvees.
Coshow, who stands 6 ft. 6 in., j
has been making a strong bid for
the center spot during prc-season
practice, mainly on the strength of
an accurate hook shot, which he
throws either left- or right-hand- j
ed.
Monroe, who starred on the grid- j
irorl as well as the court as a frosh,
missed the entire 1953 football sea
son because of a broken hand suf
fered in the opening game.
Reserves most likely to see ac
tion this week end are Carlos Bea, j
forward; Barry Brown, forward; Leo
