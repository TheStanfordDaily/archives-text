# Top Frosh Grid Hopefuls To Bolster Indians in '54
## 
### DICK MARISCAL 
In two encounters of the 1953 season against Cal, the Stanford
frosh gridders displayed many varsity prospects.
After outplaying a rugged Cub eleven for most of the game
the Papooses dropped !hc first game, 19-12, and then came through
two weeks later to dump the Cal frosh at Berkeley, 19-14.

♦ Because of great speed and fine
1 deceptive ballcarriers in the
I baekficld, this year's crew ein
i phasized a strong running attack
I instead of concentrating on aerial
I maneuvers as has been the pie -
! vious practice. Frosh Coach Bob
Ghilotti declared that "this is the
| best all-around running team I've
I had since I've been here.
Two 160-pound tricksters, Hank
| Roldan from Orosi and Mike Raf
; tery, Inglewood, although they
might be hampered by size in var
sity competition, were standouts in
the left half post because of their
exceptional deceptive running. Ilol
aan was also the leading scorer with
three TD's to his credit.
Hailing from Lincoln High in
San Francisco was fullback Tony
i Scrra, 185, who ought to have a
good chance for a varsity berth
because of his line - splitting
drives. Spelling Scrra at fullback
was 175-pounder Ron Pataky.
Handling the signal-calling chores
were Paul Camera from St.. Igna
tius and John Brodie, Oakland
Tech. Camera at 180 pounds will be
another top varsity contender be
cause of his fine running and pass
ing, while Brodie is a first-rate ae
rialist.
Although the line did not possess
excessive size, it more than made
up for it in speed and drive. Bol
stering the forward wall were the
two Dons, Carswell, 200, from Ha
waii, who was known for his ex
tremely hard blocking at left tackle,
and Manoukian. who packs his 205
pounds on a 5-10 frame and distrib
uted it evenly to his opponents at
the left guard slot.
Both of these lads will be giv
ing PCC linemen a great deal of
trouble in the very near future.
On the other side handing out
I more than their share of knocks
! and blocks were little Chuck Sa-
I vio at right guard and rugged

I Dale Smith, another low - built
I 205-pounder, at tackle.
Bi!l Hammond, 200 - pound leCt
tackle, also showed a lot of poten
tial and will be making a strong bid
next season.
This year's end ; were blessed
with a good deal of ail-around
height. At rip lit end was Bud
) McLcllan, a 6-1, 195-pound pass
catcher, while at the other spot
was Bob Gergen. Although only
6 feet and weighing 175 pounds.
Gcrgen proved himself the best
all - around defensive man and
displayed a large amount of foot
ball sense in doping out plays.
Gene Manzer and Dick Hail at (5-3
and 6-2 respectively made good use
of their height in snagging a large
percentage of passes. Bill Hooks,
6-1, from North Dakota, also
showed a great deal of promise be
cause of his receiving ability.
Several other top varsity po
tentials who were out the major
part of the season because of in
juries are 185 - pound fullback
Rufus JelTris who was nudging a
starting berth until injured, fleet
left half John Harlin from Se
, quoia High, and Quincy Powers
J who was showing fine form at the
quarterback slot.
