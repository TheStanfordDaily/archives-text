# Western Civ, a Stanford Tradition With Fame Spread Over the Land
## 
### HELEN DEWAR 
Western Civ is as much a Stan
ford tradition as the Axe and the
Big Game bonfire. Its fame has
spread far beyond the walls of
Stanford, and almost every in
coming freshman has heard wild
tales of the famous Stanford Civ
;curse
Since 1935, when Western Civ was
instituted into the University cur
riculum, it has been the only one
course required for graduation. For
many engineer ing and mecl majors,
it is the only history course included
in their programs.
Prior to 1935, the only course com
parable to Western Civ that was
given was Citizenship, a catch-all
course in economics, government,
sociology, world history, and philos
ophy. *
Western Civ was established as
an orientation course designed to
•rive a bread background in the
development at the Western
world, to teach its students to
think critically and analytically,
and to prepare them to assume
leadership in a democratic society.
.Stanford, in its Western Civ class
es, was the first university to adopt
small discussion sections in pref
erence to* large lecture classes, al
though many other schools have
adopted this program. The students
control discussion and the instruc
tors act only as moderators.
Stanford also initiated the pro
gram of placing greater emphasis on
source reading over textbooks. Sev
enty-five per cent ol the required
reading in Civ is from source read
ing.
The enrollment in Civ classes
this quarter sot a new record of
f.iiOti students. The enrollment is
expected to be increased by an
other hundred winter quarter. The
size of the individual classes av
erages 27, and none exceed 2!).
Western Civ has its own separate

library—a fact that is well known to
all freshmen. This library contains
. over six thousand volumes, of which
j three thousand are used as required

j source reading.
Holland C. Rogers is assistant di
rector of Western Civ, acting in
J the absence of D, William C. Bark,
| who is on leave until spring. He
| heads a department of sixteen in
structors.
An opportunity to study more
j intensively and independently is
I offered to the more advanced stu

dents through Independent Study.
The students taking this course
meet in small groups once a week
to discuss the week's work.
Five units instead of the regular
lour are given lor the course. The
emphasis is not placed on exams,
but on the daily reading assign
ments" and weekly discussion sec
tions.


FROSH HOME AWAY FROM HOME—Nestled in behind the Main Libe and Cubberley Audi
torium sits the Western Civ Libe, the all too famous hangout of studious Western Civ scholars
This library holds over 6,000 volumes.
