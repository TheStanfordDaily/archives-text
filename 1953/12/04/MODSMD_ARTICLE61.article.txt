## Education Grad Student Says She Likes Stanford 
### JOANNE OLSON 
Miss Ferhath Qutbuddin is one of the first women students
from Pakistan to arrive on the Stanford campus.
In choosing the school where she would continue her graduate
siudies, Miss Qutbuddin was impressed by the Farm's reputa
tion and scholarship standards, and came "with big hopes and

ambitions to get my Ph.D. from*
Stanford."
So far, he her hopes have
been justified, as she likes Stan
ford and the faculty members and
students she has met both in the 1
Education Department and else- j
where on campus. She finds, !
though, that the quarter system
means more hard work and hur
rying than the semester system.
As an extra - curricular activity
she works two hours every day in

the circulation department of The
Daily.
Miss Qutbuddin lias been in the
United States two years. She was
sent by the government of Pakistan
to get her advanced education in j
this country. Last year she attended
the University of Kansas City,
where she earned her Master's de
gree in education.
Her main interest is elementary
education ;ind she hopes to "serve
(fie children of Pakistan" where she
had been the principal of an ele
mentary school in Karachi, the cap
ita] city, for two years.
Miss Quthuddin always wears
her native dress, and she said she
lias become accustomed to the
stares that follow her everywhere
on the campus. The satin pants
are callotl "shelwar" in her native
language, Urdu. The knee-length

tunic is the "kameez,"* and the
stole, usually of chiffon or net,
is called the "duppata."
After completing her work here,
Miss Qutbuddin plans to return to
Pakistan, which is, she explains,
'the youngest, largest Moslem dem
ocratic nation in the world today."
She hopes to be given a job by the
government there.
