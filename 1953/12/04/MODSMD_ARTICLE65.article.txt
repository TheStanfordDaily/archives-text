### MARY ELLEN ROMNEY 
Several hundred children will be made happier this year be

true spirit of Christmas.
Up on the Row, :.ome of ihe houses are planning a variety of
Christmas projects. Gifts for cach member of a large underprivi-

leged family wili be provided by
I-lurlburt. At Roth, .1 food basket
will be assembled for some needy
family.
Madrono is trimming a tree and
planning caroling lor the Convales
cent Home, and many other resi
dences will contribute gilts to the
children there.
I.alhrop will turn its annual
party around its Christmas tree
into a children's party this year,
and the quests will be youngsters
from a public playground. High
lighting the traditional Christmas
dinner at Lagunita will he the
placing of brightly wrapped Con
Home gifts, one from cach girl,
under the tree.
Sometime around this Easier, at
Waibiingen, Germany, some
children will enjoy a belated
Christmas party. The hostesses will
be the girls oi Branner Hall. This
project is rapidly becoming a tra
dition at Branner, as this is the
fourth year it has been carried out.
Right after Thanksgiving, Bran

ner starts assembling hard candies,
plastic cars and dolls, hair ribbons,
paper dolls, crayons, scrapbooks,
gum, squeak toys, and all the other
little gifts guaranteed to thrill the
German children.
These are then gift-wrapped and
picked in large boxes with warm
used clothes. The clothes, which
serve as padding for the boxes, are
welcomed by the Wart home for
refugee girls in Germany.
When the project originated,
Branner's intermediary was Mrs.
Stuart Hannon, formerly of Ath
erton, and at the time living in
Waiblingcn. On one of her ,gift
distributing trips to the Home
she saw a tiny golden - haired
baby girl, whom she and her hus
band later adopted into their own
family. Since then, the present
go-between, Mrs. George Henry,
has also adopted a baby girl
whom she met at the Children's
Home.
