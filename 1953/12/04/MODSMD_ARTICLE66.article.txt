# HERE COMES SANTA CLAUS
## Christmas Spirit Is Shown In Gay Con Home Plans 
### PAT KING 
If you're planning to open
your presents early Christmas
morning, you'll have to do it
without the help of Santa Claus.
3ecause at 10 a.m. sharp he has
a date with 80 kids at the Stan
j ford Convalescent Home.
Every year all the children write
him letters asking for dolls or
woodburning sets or flashlights, and
! every year Santa arrives just at 10,
with just the right present for each
smiling moppet.
The letters have ahead}' gone out.
One small girl wrote:
"Dear Santa Claus,
"I hope you're not working too
hard. I would like a 2 feet panda
bear. I think I have been a good
girl."
Another requested "a nice big
■•101 l with skates and shoes."
The kids are keeping busy, too,
i waiting for the Big Day. School
time is spent making colored paper
decorations—trees and bells, snow
men and candles to brighten up the
windows. Long paper chains and
other tree ornaments are beginning
to appear on top of dressers.
They aren't forgetting their fami
j lies or the Con Home doctors, ei
ther. Every doctor will find a leath
! er bookmark with an Indian on it
J in his Christmas stocking — a gift
i from his little patients. And por
i ents and relatives will reccivc ev

erything from pot holders to book j
ends to fancy coat hangers.
The biggest pre - Christmas
event will occur about Dec. 21—
decorating the ceiling-high trees
in each of the three units. Every
one gets to help. The run-abouts
help string the tinsel and put on
the lights, while those in bed are
wheeled close enough to hang
o rnamcnts on the outside
branches.
Then comes the Night Before
Christmas, .an evening filled with
songs, surprises, and laughter. A |
special supper complete with a ,
party hat and gift awaits each child.
Another Christmas Eve tradition
is the distribution of hand ; carved
wooden toys, the annual contribu
tion of Mr. and Mrs. F. B. Aben
heim of Atherton. The Abenheims, i
both retired, spend the entire year
working on table and chair sets, doll
cradles, carts, and other toys de
signed to make small fry happy.
All this is just a preview of the
main event. Christmas morning
every face is scrubbed, every shoe
polished, every bed spotless. Hoys
put on their Sunday-best clothes
and each girl <ty>ns a red and
green hair bow.
The big moment comes at 10 o'- !
clock when Santa, accompanied by j
Mrs. R. S. Atwood, Con Home su- j
perintendent, and numerous friends 1

'of the Con Home, opens the dooi of
the boys' bed unit. It takes all his
! helpers to carry the huge, sheet
wrapped bundle which contains a
toy for each boy — just what he
| asked Santa for in his letter.
(Of course the kids don't know it,
but all their letters have been read
by the Sciots of San Jose, a Masonic
organization, which sponsors this
annual party. The Sciots and their
wives found the right present for
each youngster and turned them
i over to Santa, also a Sciot.)
At the same time the annual
; Christmas stockings from Castilleja
( School are handed out.
The same routine is followed in
the girls' unit and the run-about
unit — the excitement as Santa
walks in, the shrieks as each
present is handed out, and the
mounds of paper and ribbon pil
ing up on the floor.
Finally the Big Day ends. The
last carol is warbled, a little weakly,
: a little ofT-key. The tinsel hangs
limply on the trees, and crumpled
j wrappings are scattered far and
wide. Eighty kids tumble into bed,
clutching new treasures. The next
| day they will begin the almost end-
I less procedure of writing thank-you
; notes, but just then they're too
weary to do anything but sleep and
! cream of next Christmas.
