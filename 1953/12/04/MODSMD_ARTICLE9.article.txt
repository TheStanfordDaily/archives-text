for the CIO in the East Bay.")
Today's session was the third in

j greeting at which he was said to be
j present.
"Oh yes, of course," the quiet
spoken, balding witness replied.

California Congressman were among those named as having been
involved in Bay Area Communist activities by an ex-Communist
newspaperman who appeared today as a "friendly" witness be
fore the House Un-American Activities Committee meeting here.

The witness, David Blodgett, 32,

i mittee of the Communist party in
Alameda County.
He said he saw Condon at the
meeting which was held in the Oak
land home of a Communist in the

leans for the American Municipal
i Convention, when contacted by the

party from 1943 to 1949 and a mem
