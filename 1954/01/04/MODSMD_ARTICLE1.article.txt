# No More Daytime Driving Here
## Driving To Be Prohibited Near Engineering Corner 
### JAY BECKER 
Today between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. students won't be able to drive
near Engineering Corner. Chains will cross Lasuen Street just
north of Panama Street and Escondido Road at the southeast cor
ner of Cubberley Building.
The blocking off of the L-shaped section will enable pedestrians

lo cross to class without, bothering*
drivers, said Carroll Blacker, Super
intendent of Buildings and Grounds.
Geographically, this means (hat
students wishing to drive from
Encina, To, yon, Stern, or Crothcrs '
to the Cellar or the Post OHice
must either completely circle the
Quad by driving past History,
Physics and Geology Corners and
past the Daily Shack and the Fire
House, or else drive up Argucllo
and make a right turn at the Row.
Barriers wili be under the chains i
for better visibility. By the end of
the week signs will be placed near
the Post Office and at the Junction
of Eseondido and Galvez.
"The Buildings and Grounds Com- j
mittcc studied the problem of autos
vs. students for a year before any !
action was taken," said Blacker.
The chains will be removed after
5 p.m. and driving will be permitcd. i
Blacker emphasized that th c |
blocking ofT of the road section is |
being tried out as a possible solu
tion to the traffic hazard in the area i
near Engineering Corner.
•Eventually, removable posts may
be used in place of the chains and !

barriers to give lire trucks rapid
access to the area.
A few students have already op
posed the plan of blocking off the
street past Engineering Corner,
mainly on the grounds of incon
venience in traveling to or from
Palo Alto and the Row.
The Buildings and Grounds Com
mittee is composed of the Police
Chief, Fire Chief, University Busi
ness Manager, a representative of
the Comptroller's Office, and the
Superintendent of Buildings and
Grounds. The Business Manager au
thorized the Corporation Yard to
procure the chains after the Dean of
Students, 11. Donald Winbiglcr gave
a favorable opinion of the plan.


NO MORE DRIVING—This L-shaped area will be chained off (arrows) during the day to exclude
automobile traffic. According to officials, the area has been a danger to pedestrians. Eventually
the chains will be replaced by removable white posts similar to this already placed on the
road between the Quad and Main Library. The chains will be removed at 5 p.m. each evening
when pedestrian traffic has lessened. Although the roping off of the area does not start until
7 a.m. this morning, the action has already met with opposition from a number of students.

The blocking off of the L-shaped section will enable pedestrians

lo cross to class without, bothering*
drivers, said Carroll Blacker, Super
intendent of Buildings and Grounds.
Geographically, this means (hat
students wishing to drive from
Encina, To, yon, Stern, or Crothcrs '
to the Cellar or the Post OHice
must either completely circle the
Quad by driving past History,
Physics and Geology Corners and
past the Daily Shack and the Fire
House, or else drive up Argucllo
and make a right turn at the Row.
Barriers wili be under the chains i
for better visibility. By the end of
the week signs will be placed near
the Post Office and at the Junction
of Eseondido and Galvez.
"The Buildings and Grounds Com- j
mittcc studied the problem of autos
vs. students for a year before any !
action was taken," said Blacker.
The chains will be removed after
5 p.m. and driving will be permitcd. i
Blacker emphasized that th c |
blocking ofT of the road section is |
being tried out as a possible solu
tion to the traffic hazard in the area i
near Engineering Corner.
•Eventually, removable posts may
be used in place of the chains and !

barriers to give lire trucks rapid
access to the area.
A few students have already op
posed the plan of blocking off the
street past Engineering Corner,
mainly on the grounds of incon
venience in traveling to or from
Palo Alto and the Row.
The Buildings and Grounds Com
mittee is composed of the Police
Chief, Fire Chief, University Busi
ness Manager, a representative of
the Comptroller's Office, and the
Superintendent of Buildings and
Grounds. The Business Manager au
thorized the Corporation Yard to
procure the chains after the Dean of
Students, 11. Donald Winbiglcr gave
a favorable opinion of the plan.


NO MORE DRIVING—This L-shaped area will be chained off (arrows) during the day to exclude
automobile traffic. According to officials, the area has been a danger to pedestrians. Eventually
the chains will be replaced by removable white posts similar to this already placed on the
road between the Quad and Main Library. The chains will be removed at 5 p.m. each evening
when pedestrian traffic has lessened. Although the roping off of the area does not start until
7 a.m. this morning, the action has already met with opposition from a number of students.
