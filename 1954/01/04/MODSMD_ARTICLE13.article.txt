## 
### 
Stanford's graduate students
in engineering will soon be
housed in a new and separate
dormitory, probably by autumn
quarter, 1955.
President. Wallace Sterling an
nounced last. Wednesday that work
on ;i new $400,000 dormitory, to be
built adjacent, to Crothers Hall, will
begin early this year.
The building, which will house
more than 100 graduate engineer
ing students, has been scheduled
for construction as a result of a
new gift of $240,000 from one or
Stanford's principal benefactors,
Judge (ieorge K. Crothers.
The San Francisco attorney, who
helped develop Crothers Hall for
law students, has made the gifl in
honor and memory of his mother,
Margaret Jane Crothet . The new
dormitory will be named Crothers
Memorial Hall.
The building will measure 40 by
Li.'JO lert and will be two stories high
â€¢with a full basement. Most, of the
residents will be housed in double
rooms and space will be provided
for clubrooms, a small technical li
brary to assist students in their
studies, and a museum where re
cent engineering developments will
be displayed.
Closely resembling the architec

Judge Crothers was a member of
the pioneer class of '95 at Stanford
and obtained a Master's degree in
law in 1896. He established the Uni
versity's complicated legal standing
on a firm base and in 1902 he be
came the first alumnus to serve on
the Stanford Board of Trustees. He
was a board member for 10 years.
The value of housing graduate
students together has been empha
sized by Frederick E. Terman. dean
of the Stanford School of Engineer
ing.
"When they live together, they
learn to work together and they
teach each other," the dean point-

Ed out. "This mingling- is espe
cially stimulating at Stanford be
cause we attract graduate stu
dents from more than a hundred
different colleges in all parts of
the country. Residents of (broth
ers Memorial Hall will form
friendships which will endure
throughout their professional ca
reers."
Crothers Memorial Hall will be
the first unit to get under way in
Stanford's current $9,000,000 dormi
tory program. A new men's hall to
replace 62-year-old Encina Hall is
projected for the near future.
Longer range plans call for a wom
en's dormitory and completion of
the Stern Hall quadrangle for men.
