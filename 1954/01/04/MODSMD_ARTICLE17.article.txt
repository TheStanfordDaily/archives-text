# A 						Good Year—IF
## 
### 
Nineteen fifty-four looks like it'll be a good
year.
It certainly is a year of promise.
Internationally, the- outlook, while not glow
ingly optimistic, is none ihe less encouraging,
with the Russians indicviing a more peaceful
policy line.
Nationally, the prospects for the new year,
according to the cheerful statements of the
Chief Executive, are bright. Business, it is said,
v/ill continue on its present high level of pros
perity.
And locally, on the campus, with determina
tion, the student body and the Administration
should be able to galva.iize many of the hopes
of the past into specific and beneficial pro
grams.
The ground work for a prosperous and pro
gressive new year at Stanford University has
been carefully laid within the past several
years.
With penetrating foresight, University ad
ministrators have laid magnificent plans for
the development of Stanford's extensive
acreage into a thriving industrial, commer
cial, and residential community.
These plans, some of which have already
been manifested in fine buildings and throb
bing industry, and others of which will be so
developed this year, wove the product of care
ful study by the officials of this University.
And with equal forethought, some student
leaders—serving on the Executive Commit
tee and on the varicin ASSU boards- have
a/so laid tine plans. Though their plans will
not produce such specific and observable
works as a factory or a tall apartment build
ing, they will, we believe, add extra and sig
nificant breadth to the splendid measure of
education already available here.
Their plans focus particularly on such recent
creations as the Political Union and National
Students Association, two groups which dedi
cate much of their rt tent ion on the stimulation
of discussion on political topics of contempo

rary concern. The Political Union, as viewed
by its founders, will deal with the broader as- j
pects of political controversy. The NSA, on
the other hand, according to its charter, will
consider only those issues which particularly
involve the students of this and other nations. '
Both organizations took their infant steps on '
campus last guarter. Both were the product of
considerable debate and discussion.
But neither so far has progressed much be
yond its infancy.
Yet, with a continued exercise of firm re
solve and careful planning both could be
shaped into adult and vigorous adjuncts of
our liberal curricula.
For both, if developed to full and vital
maturity and if left uncensored by anxious ,
alumni, could provide the forums where stu
dents could critically consider the issues
which crucially affect them and their nation.
It seems only reasonable that a University
which prides itself on the scope and magnitude j
of its liberal program should offer every en
couragement to students to press for the full i
development of these groups.
Obviously, there is much work to be done !
before the Political Union and NSA are click
ing on all cylinders.
The leaders of these groups are cognizant,
or at least should be, of the weaknesses and
the voids.
They should realize that primarily, in this
early stage of the two organizations, a contin
ued and unrelenting promotion campaign must
be inaugurated until students and faculty and
alumni are informed as to their objects and
ideals.
The year 1954 should provide the time for
the development and fruition of plans for these
groups, as it should mean the'further extension
of the University's land development program.
It should be a good year, if the students and
the administrators and the alumni are willing
to rely on the same guality of precise planning
and forethought that have characterized the
University's 63-year history.

It should be a good year, if the students and
the administrators and the alumni are willing
to rely on the same guality of precise planning
and forethought that have characterized the
University's 63-year history.
Nineteen fifty-four looks like it'll be a good
year.
It certainly is a year of promise.
Internationally, the- outlook, while not glow
ingly optimistic, is none ihe less encouraging,
with the Russians indicviing a more peaceful
policy line.
Nationally, the prospects for the new year,
according to the cheerful statements of the
Chief Executive, are bright. Business, it is said,
v/ill continue on its present high level of pros
perity.
And locally, on the campus, with determina
tion, the student body and the Administration
should be able to galva.iize many of the hopes
of the past into specific and beneficial pro
grams.
The ground work for a prosperous and pro
gressive new year at Stanford University has
been carefully laid within the past several
years.
With penetrating foresight, University ad
ministrators have laid magnificent plans for
the development of Stanford's extensive
acreage into a thriving industrial, commer
cial, and residential community.
These plans, some of which have already
been manifested in fine buildings and throb
bing industry, and others of which will be so
developed this year, wove the product of care
ful study by the officials of this University.
And with equal forethought, some student
leaders—serving on the Executive Commit
tee and on the varicin ASSU boards- have
a/so laid tine plans. Though their plans will
not produce such specific and observable
works as a factory or a tall apartment build
ing, they will, we believe, add extra and sig
nificant breadth to the splendid measure of
education already available here.
Their plans focus particularly on such recent
creations as the Political Union and National
Students Association, two groups which dedi
cate much of their rt tent ion on the stimulation
of discussion on political topics of contempo

rary concern. The Political Union, as viewed
by its founders, will deal with the broader as- j
pects of political controversy. The NSA, on
the other hand, according to its charter, will
consider only those issues which particularly
involve the students of this and other nations. '
Both organizations took their infant steps on '
campus last guarter. Both were the product of
considerable debate and discussion.
But neither so far has progressed much be
yond its infancy.
Yet, with a continued exercise of firm re
solve and careful planning both could be
shaped into adult and vigorous adjuncts of
our liberal curricula.
For both, if developed to full and vital
maturity and if left uncensored by anxious ,
alumni, could provide the forums where stu
dents could critically consider the issues
which crucially affect them and their nation.
It seems only reasonable that a University
which prides itself on the scope and magnitude j
of its liberal program should offer every en
couragement to students to press for the full i
development of these groups.
Obviously, there is much work to be done !
before the Political Union and NSA are click
ing on all cylinders.
The leaders of these groups are cognizant,
or at least should be, of the weaknesses and
the voids.
They should realize that primarily, in this
early stage of the two organizations, a contin
ued and unrelenting promotion campaign must
be inaugurated until students and faculty and
alumni are informed as to their objects and
ideals.
The year 1954 should provide the time for
the development and fruition of plans for these
groups, as it should mean the'further extension
of the University's land development program.
