### DICK MANSFIELD 
A local wretch one commented that, whiz though
he was at writing blut i r>!. fraught with brilliance,
he couldn't fill out a re* I uok to save his life. He
flunked his regi t ration bool so often that they
finally booted him out of school. Pathetic as this
tale might get if il wound on much further, it does
have one redeem in;; feeturc: The wretch in question
always filled out his Veteran's Information card
perfectly. Of course, he wasn'i a veteran.
Hereto, then, is appended a fanciful monograph,
partly whimsy and partly lies entitled:

IV. How to Fill Out a Reg Hook (Without Mental
Exertion, or, Indeed, Thought of Any Kind)
Always remember your name, your campus ad- I
dress, and your father's occupation—with these mor- J
sels of intelligensia, you can fill out almost anything !
in the reg book except the Honor Code card—for that
you must be able to sign your name in blood. Your j
father's occupation, if it is something in the order
of Undersecretary of the Security Division of the |
Alameda County Coronary Thrombosis League, |
should be shortened. Invent him a different occupa
tion, one which will be short enough to fit into the 1
'/i inch allotted in the reg book.
Use ink—don't blot—greasy black pencil is easier
but smudges the fingers—fill out all study schedule
cards and attach any extras you may have.
Keep smiling— there's always something worse, iii :
this case:
V. I low to Pay Fees (Without a Song—Whimpers
Sotto Voce Permitted)
Again, you must be able <o bleed. If a scholar- j
ship student, you should also have what is known
in the trade as :i Needy (or Racking) Cough. Bring
in the loot in dollar bills and count it out. Better
yet, pieces of eight. Easier? Sure—you won't have i
to go through it again, and that's for sure. If the
cashiers don't get you, the people behind you in ;
line will.
VI. How to Stand by Passively as They Tear Up Your
Keg Book (Although Understandably Horrified)
Clench teeth—close your eyes. Do not curse when
they send you back for your adviser's signature. You
may wince (very slightly) when they stamp your
ASSU card (HARD) and then tear it in half.
VII A Brief Epilogue
Good luck, troops.

A local wretch one commented that, whiz though
he was at writing blut i r>!. fraught with brilliance,
he couldn't fill out a re* I uok to save his life. He
flunked his regi t ration bool so often that they
finally booted him out of school. Pathetic as this
tale might get if il wound on much further, it does
have one redeem in;; feeturc: The wretch in question
always filled out his Veteran's Information card
perfectly. Of course, he wasn'i a veteran.

partly whimsy and partly lies entitled:

IV. How to Fill Out a Reg Hook (Without Mental
Exertion, or, Indeed, Thought of Any Kind)
Always remember your name, your campus ad- I
dress, and your father's occupation—with these mor- J
sels of intelligensia, you can fill out almost anything !
in the reg book except the Honor Code card—for that
you must be able to sign your name in blood. Your j
father's occupation, if it is something in the order
of Undersecretary of the Security Division of the |
Alameda County Coronary Thrombosis League, |
should be shortened. Invent him a different occupa
tion, one which will be short enough to fit into the 1
'/i inch allotted in the reg book.
Use ink—don't blot—greasy black pencil is easier
but smudges the fingers—fill out all study schedule
cards and attach any extras you may have.
Keep smiling— there's always something worse, iii :
this case:
V. I low to Pay Fees (Without a Song—Whimpers
Sotto Voce Permitted)
Again, you must be able <o bleed. If a scholar- j
ship student, you should also have what is known
in the trade as :i Needy (or Racking) Cough. Bring
in the loot in dollar bills and count it out. Better
yet, pieces of eight. Easier? Sure—you won't have i
to go through it again, and that's for sure. If the
cashiers don't get you, the people behind you in ;
line will.
VI. How to Stand by Passively as They Tear Up Your
Keg Book (Although Understandably Horrified)
Clench teeth—close your eyes. Do not curse when
they send you back for your adviser's signature. You
may wince (very slightly) when they stamp your
ASSU card (HARD) and then tear it in half.
VII A Brief Epilogue
Good luck, troops.
