# Find a Winter Refuge: Join the Daily Staff
## 
### 
Winter quarter is the period of
rain, fog, frost, and cold for the
Stanford campus.
It is the period of indoor activ
ity, work, and play.
And it is an appropriate time
to join the staff of the Stanford
Daily.
The Daily Shack offers warmth,
comfort, and companionship for
the cold winter months. An addi
tional benefit is experience in ad
vertising photography, reporting,
writing, and news editing.
Interested students may con
tact John McCombs (business) or
Win Griffith (editorial) at the
Daily Shack any clay after 3 p.m.
