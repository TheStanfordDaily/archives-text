# Physical Society Views New Measuring Process
## 
### 
A new scientific process for the
precise measurement of the earth's
magnetic field was explained by
Dr. IVTarlin Packard and Dr. Russell
Varian al the recent winter meeting
of I lie American Physical Society at
Stanford.
Varian, president of Varian Asso
ciates of Palo Alio, and Packard,
director of the organization's radio
fret|ueney spectroscopy research,
have developed an apparatus for
recording the measurement by nu
clear mag netic resonance methods
of the earth's magnetic field, which
varies by lime and place.
Commercially, .he process is bc
i! used If) locate underground de
posits of oil and minerals.

atoms.
Si ' iii ii may Mimi be able to

observe what happens when ;i cata
lyst breaks down one chemical
compound to form another through
an instrument called an ion micro
scope. It uses the cores of hydro
gen atoms as its "light source" and
is being developed by German sci
entists.
The German researchers haven't
seen an individual atom yet, but
they have reported acceptable pic
tures of molecules.
