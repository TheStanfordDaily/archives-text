						Phi O Book Exchange Will Open Today
## 
### 
Alpha Phi Omega's book exchange will be open today from 9 a.m.
to noon and from 1 to 4 p.m. in Main Library Room 106 to help students
sell their old textbooks at their own prices. The exchange will be open
during the same hours through Thursday of this week.
A Phi O accepts books for sale, recommending a maximum price of
two thirds the original price of the book. Then these books are left on
the book exchange's shelves through the four-day period.
The book exchange will reopen at a later date to return money and
unsold books. Books and money unclaimed at that time will be used by
the service fraternity in its various projects.
