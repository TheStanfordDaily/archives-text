# West Team Triumphs As Bob Garrett Stars
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford didn't go to the Rose Bowl, but it did the next best
thing. It "won" the East-West game, 31 to 7.
True, there were several gridders from other schools that in
truded in the V/est's most lop-sided victory of the series. But it
was Bob Gariett, voted the "most valuable player" award, and

Chuck Taylor, who head-coachcd+
the West, along with Ted Tanner |
and Sam Morlcy, who had the star
ling roles in the upset.
Yet Taylor coached a team that
wasn't supposed to have hall the
talent the East did to a spectacular
triumph.
Ami it was blond Bobby (iarrett,
the Ali-Amcrican aerial artist
from San Marino, who was as im-

pnrlanl on (he field as Taylor was
off the field.
Garrett, who got engaged a few
nights ago, climaxed his college ca
reer by scoring once, kicking two
conversions, and engineering four
scoring drives with pin-point pass
ing and adept ball handling.
The 190 pound signal rallcr com
pleted 7 for 10 passes in the lirst j
half and had an all-over total of
(0 for 17 for 152 yards. But he was
even better than the average in
dicates. Two perfectly-pitched '
long scoring passes were dropped ;
by end Gary Knafelc.
Kansan Veryl Switzcr took a fake
pass handoff from Garrett and
rambled 20 yards for the first score.
The West led, 7 to 0 at half. The
West scored JO points in the third
period, and another seven in the I

team ever assembled" could put a
score on the boards.

With the West leading 24 to 7,
Garrett cinched the game by exe
cuting a perfect bootleg. The West
had trouble budging the center of
the East line. So with fourth and
one, Garrett faked to USC's Harold
Han who dived into a pileup in
the middle of the line. In the mean
time, Garrett was all by himself in
the right end of the end zone with j
the ball.
Interestingly enough, the play
was not given to the West team by
Taylor. Garrett pulled it out of
the Stanford repertoire. Indeed, he
deserved the "most valuable"
award the scribes bestowed 011
him.
Sam Morley, the Jose Iturbi of
football, was bothered by a bad knee,
but was healthy enough to make a
beautiful 23-yard catch. Ted Tanner,

making tackles.
