# Clubs Begin Rush Today
## 
### 
Stanford's seven eating clubs
will be hosts tonight to the men
of the Class of 1957 as intensive
club rushing begins. Tonight's
open houses will begin at 8 p.m.
and, by University rule, end at
10 p.m. The clubs will hold two
more open houses, Thursday
night and again a week from to
night.
Interclub Council President Buzz.
Feinberg points out that unlimited
social contact, although it does not
begin between fraternity men and
freshmen until Sunday, is now per
mitted between clubmen and fresh
men. Club members Vnay enter
freshman residences for rushing
purposes at any time.
All clubs will be open to all
freshmen at all three open houses.
The club building, containing all
seven clubs, is located just north
of Toy on Hall.
The eating clubs do not hold a
formal group pledging ceremony as
do the fraternities. Instead, individ
ual clubs proceed at their own dis
cretion, according to Feinberg.
"Rushing and pledging schedules are
up to the individual clubs," he said.
Clubs held rushing parties over
Christmas vacation this year, al
thuogh the fraternities voted to
discontinue vacation rushing. The
interclub information booklet was
passed out to freshmen during
finals week of last quarter.
The seven Stanford eating clubs,
starting at the northwest end of the
building, arc El Campo, El Capitan,
El Quadro, El Tigre, Los Arcos,
Breakers, and El Toro.
