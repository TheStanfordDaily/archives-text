PANMUNJOM, Jan. 4 (UP)â€”The
Indian chairman of the Neutral Na
tions Repatriation Commission to
day changed his stand on the con
troversy over releasing 22,000 anti-
Communist war prisoners on Jan. 23
and said that it still must be decided
what to do about the disagreement.
Lt. Gen. K. S. Thimayya in pre
vious statements and again this
morning had said all prisoners still
in Indian custody would be released
on Jan. 23.
After a meeting of the commis
sion this morning Thimayya told
newsmen he wished to correct his
previous statements. He said they
had been too strong. His position
now, he said, was that if the two
sides fail to agree, "we will have to
decide how this problem is to be
solved."
The U.N. command has said that
it will reject any Communist' or
neutral nations proposal to postpone
release of the POW's Jan. 23 as pro
vided in (lie armistice agreement.
The Communist high command
still has not replied to the U.N.'s
statement, but the Reds arc expect
ed to continue to demand that the
POW's remain in neutral custody
until after a Korean peace confer
ence.
