LONDON, Jan. 4 (UP) â€” Emer
gency crews bulwarked Europe's
seawalls today for their gravest test
since towering tides surged inland
last February and killed more than
1,700 persons.
Wind-lashed waters already were
flooding some cities and farms on
the northern corner of the conti
nent. Winter's overdue invasion
splashed floodwnters into Ger
many's Baltic seaports of Kiel, Luc
beck, Flcnsburg, and Eckcrnforde.
Several areas of Denmark were
flooded. Waves rolled into the
streets of Ostcnd, Belgium.
