# Frosh Hear Pros, Cons Of Fraternities, Clubs
## 
### DAVE SCOTT 
The 1954 rushing season was formally launched last night in
Encina Hall at 7 as the Encina men heard the advantages of being
an independent, a member of an eating club, or a fraternity man
from representatives of the three groups.
Village men heard the same talks at 8 p.m. in the Village Audi-

torium.
Peter Bing presented the inde
pendents' point of view first. He
pointed out that tl\e cost of being
an independent is in general con
siderably less than belonging to a
fraternity or an eating club. He
stressed that an independent has
freedom of action and that his life
is his own. "Membership in a club
or fraternity in itself does not en
hance social prestige," he said.
Whether or not you are a member
of a club or are an independent,
life is what you make it at Stanford,
Bing said. Quoting V/alt Menninger,
Managing Editor of last fall's Daily,
he declared, "At Stanford belonging
is just another activity." lie ex
plained that freshmen do not have
to pledge right away, and can be
independent for a year or so be
fore deciding. w
He admitted that a lack of or
ganized social activities and I lie
necessity of having to live at the
Stanford Village are a few of the
disadvantages of being iudepend
ent.
Next Buzz Feinberg presented the
eating clubs' side of the picture.
The cost, he mentioned, is less than
that of a fraternity. He stressed the
"greater opportunities for study"
and the good academic standings of
the clubs. Feinberg declared that
there was more independence in a
club than in a fraternity and more
time for extra activities.
He closed the talk by mentioning
the time for eating club open houses
and stating that the clubs' rushing
program was not as complex as that
of the fraternities.
The talk of Gene Oils, repre
senting the fraternities, was con
cerned less with the advantages of
a fraternity than with the conduct
and procedure of rushing.
All frosh men were particularly
urged to read the rules of the pledg
ing period found in the fraternity
booklets given to them the day be
fore. "Be relaxed. Be yourself during
the open houses this week," he sug
gested.
Encina men were urged to take
their time in making up their minds
upon the fraternity of their choice.
Dils stressed the importance of get
ting to know the sophomore and
junior members of the fraternities.
"You will not live with the seniors
at all," he said.
ASSU President Don Lozabnick
closed the meeting by saying that it
was important to weigh carefully
the advantages of all three alterna
tives.
Head Encina Sponsor Tom Blount
then sent Encina men to wing meet
ings where the sponsors explained
more about the pledging period and
answered questions.
