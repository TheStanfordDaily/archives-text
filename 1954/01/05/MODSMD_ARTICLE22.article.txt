# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
YViiLW!
W Hew!
As they say, on the TV mystery programs, now the
story can be told. It can be told in its ugly, sordid
entirety:
I had my head in the lion's mouth, and he opened
his mouth, and let it out. Or to put it in other words,

1 came within a gnat's eyelash of
being drafted. (A crescendo of
horror music in the background,
please, professor.)
It all began on the day after
Thanksgiving. No sooner had I
finished offering thanks for the
bounteous good things that had
come my way than it happened.
1 sensed something was wrong
when I spotted the postman. He
was wearing sergeant's stripes.
TTâ€ž 1 - - I _. L. ! A

He handed me a long white envelope that stared up
at me through its beady post marks. I opened it, and
the letter said:
"Greetings from the President of the United
States."
"Gosh," I thought. "Sure nice of Ike to remember
little old me on Thanksgiving. Maybe he wants The
Daily to cover one of his golf matches."
Then I read on: "Having subjected yourself to a
board of your peers, you are hereby ordered to report
for induction into the United States Army on the
28th day of December."
"Yipes," 1 yelled, doing flips off the wall. "I've been
drafted!! They can't do this to me!! They said I
could have until June to get my degree!! They can't
do this to me!!"
At first 1 thought of committing suicide by jumping
oil Russ Lawler's head. But I thought better of it,
and whipped down to the draft board. A secretary
was sitting at the desk.
"Pardon me," I stammered, "there must be some
mistake. I received my induction notice, and I was
assured I would be deferred until June."
"Theie's no mistake," she said, rearranging her
lace, which turned out to be her makeup. "We found
a loophole so we can draft you. You'll look good in
khuki. Ha, ha! Hoe, bee!"
I managed a sickly smile, all the while feeling like

putting out my cigarette between her eyes. But 1
don't smoke.
I was told that ! could make a personal appeal
to the board, although informed sources told me
that the chances of getting a deferment were 1,000
to one againsi me. Rut as Kail Marx said in the
Communist Manifesto, 1 had nothing to lose except
my chains and a world to gain.
On the fateia 1 night of Dee. 14, 1 made my appeal
to a Etroup of eight men. When I saw who the chair
man of the board was, I did a double take. It was
a former neighbor of ours, who:;e brand new Lincoln
Zephyr I had thrown an egg at one Halloween in my
younger days. He had never forgiven me for it.
"You can't do this to me," I implored. "Don't you
realize who I am? I'm Pete Grotay, champion of the
people, bull ses:;ioner, civilian, and good guy. And
besides, who will those always-trying, seldom-suc
ceeding gagmen at the Chappie have to poke fun at
if I leave?"
I sensed that the chairman didn't sympathize with
my argument when he took out his violin and played
some hearts and (lowers music.
"Fort Orel's not bad," smiled one of the board mem
bers "All it needs to be a paradise is a few nice
people ancf a few good facilities."
"That's all hell needs to be a paradise, also," I said,
trying to make a funny.
After my appeal, I was asked to step outside for
a minute-and-a-half. It seemed like 10 eternities.
Then the hoard co-ordinator stepped out. Keeping
a poker face, she said in words more eloquent than
Shakespeare ever thought of, "You may sleep
peacefully tonight. You have until June."
A half-hour later when I had revived, I excitedly
thanked the members of the board, gentlemen and
scholars to the man. Then ! ran down the steps, tak
ing eight at a time, and shot out onto the sidewalk
screaming and jumping. Christmas shoppers thought
I was crazy. But I didn't care.
I've been deferred. That means I can hit the ski
slopes, see Hon Tomsk- going on scoring jags in tjie
Matchbox Pavilion, and hoc. it up at the Cellar. That
means that I can lie on the lawn in spring quarter,
go to good classes, and visit L'Ominie's. And just
generally wallow in the splendoi that is civilian life.
Whew!
