# 'The Cruel Sea'—Another Moving British Masterpiece of Underplay
## 
### SUE WHEAT 
It takes more than ordinary skill to reshape a
novel as outstanding as "The Cruel Sea" into an
equally outstanding movie. And even J. Arthur
Rank hasn't conjured up enough of it to do screen
justice to Nicholas Monsarrat's best-selling story of
the Battle of the Atlantic.
He has, however, with usual superb British under-

play, produced a strong film—
one worth any movie-goer's 90
cents and two hours.
"The Cruel Sea," which opened
at the Park last week for an en
gagement of about two weeks,
deals with the men of the es
cort ships that guided convoys
through the U-Boat-infested At
lantic at the beginning of World

War 11. Specifically, it deals with the men of the
H M.S. Compass Rose—in 1939, a brand new cor
vette manned with officers snatched from civilian
life and hastily trained for the despei atcly expendable
convoy escort duty.
Hero of the film is Lieut. Commander Ericson,
captain of the Compass Rose and the only pro
fessional sailor among the corvette's officers. Played
l>y Jack Hawkins, Ericson is a tough, burly com
mander who loves his duty, but hates the war and
the de-humani/ation he f?els it is working 011 him.
By the time he eug : n?ers the destruction of two
U-Bonts. has his ship sunk out from under him,
and earns another half stripe and a new command,
he emerges not only as a good captain, but as a
very lovable human l>eing.
Don Sinden—a watered down version of George
Saunders—plays the part of Lockhart, Ericson's first
"left-tenant." He turns in a convincing, if nonde
script. portrayal of a green but brave (and finally
competent) ex-civilian at war. It is this effect of
normalcy, even of mediocrity, that heightens the
sincerity of the characters and the authenticity rtf
the drama.

It is interesting to consider what American direc
tion would have done with the same script—especially
in the tense situations. Take the time the Compass
Rose had to drop behind her convoy and drift for
several hours as a juicy U-Boat target while an
engine part was being repaired.
An American version would have had the sweat
rolling down the temples of really worried audience.
Not so the British version. Drama is not forced upon
the audience. If you want to get excited about the
fact that at any minute the hero might be facing the
business end of a German torpedo, you can go right
ahead—but you don't have to. Instead, you can sit
back and consider the dilemma almost academically.
The objective situation supplies the drama. Flash
ing eyes and bulging jugular veins are replaced by
meaningful dialogue. The situation is able to speak
for itself.
If thrills and chills are a movie's object, then,
Hollywood ranks first in doling them out. But when
it comes to perceptive interpretation of human re
lations, the British films—among them "Tin; Cruel
Sea"— dance rings around most American attempts.
The dialogue is forceful, often humorous, and never
drawn out. Monsarrat's characters have suffered little
in the editing of his book. What does suffer is the
continuity of the story. Sub-plots dealing with the
men's lives ashore are treated superficially. The effect
of an unfaithful wile or the death of a sister at home
on the actions of a man while at sea is for the most
pari unexplained.
Furthermore, incidents 011 the sea are sudden,
varied, and subject to rapid scene transition. While
this prevents boredom for an audience, it also re
sults in n certain amount of confusion, for » single
theme to unite the story is sacrificed. One is not
sure whether man is lighting the sea, the Germans,
or himself.
Actually, Rank probably figured right in deciding
it was a little of each.
At any rate, he's turned out another first rate movie
to give a moving account of a heart-breaking phase
of the last war.
