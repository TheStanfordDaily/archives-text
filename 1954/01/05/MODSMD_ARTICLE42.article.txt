## 
### 
Stanford's hopes for a chance at
the Northern California Intercollegi
ate Soccer Conference title faded
Dec. 5 as the Indian soccermen and
champion USF battled to a score
less tie. The tie was USF's 55th
straight league game without a lust-.
Neils Vinding, Sam Suarez, Derek
Liecty, and John Sentous were out
standing for the Cards, who were
foiled by two Don goalies Bill Cox
and George Durchslag.
Vinding, Suarez, and Liecty all
saw action Dec. 12, as the NCISC
All-Stars bowed to U$F 2 to 0.
