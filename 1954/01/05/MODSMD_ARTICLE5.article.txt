# Newly Blocked-off Area Confuses Campus Drivers
## 
### 
Confusion on the part of student drivers caused several traffic
jams at the corner of Lasuen Street and Escondido Road near
Engineering Corner yesterday, when barriers blocking the two
streets were erected for the first time.
However, according to Stanford Police Chief Gordon Davis, the

traffic tieups should disappear as
soon as students become familiar
with the roped-off areas.
The L-shaped area extending from
just north of Panama Street to the
southeast corner of Cubberl'ey
Building will be closed to autos be
tween the approximate hours of
7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The new non-traffic area will also
force the Stanford bus service to
change its route temporarily. Ac
cording to Worth Prine of the Pen
insula Transit Lines, the inbound
bus route will remain the same, but
the outbound bus will turn oIT La
suen Street at Arguello, going all the
way on Arguello to Escondido Road,
where it will resume its regular
route.
Davis wished to emphasize that
the chaining oft of the area has
been done as an experimental
measure only, and if the project
docs not work satisfactorily, the
barriers w'll be removed.
The decision to rope off this area
came after considerable study by
the Buildings and Grounds Com
mittee. Reasons for the decision in
eluded a danger to pedestrians and
noi.se generated from squealing tires.
''We have had a number of com
plaints from people who have had to
literally jump to get out of the way
of autos rounding this corner at
high speeds," Davis said.
' We have also received complaints
from teachers in the Education
Building and students in the Cub
berlcy Library about traffic noise.
This chaining ofT is simply an ex
perimental plan as a solution to the
problem."
Signs reminding students of the
dead-end streets will soon be
erected by the Post Office and the
Stern parking lot.
