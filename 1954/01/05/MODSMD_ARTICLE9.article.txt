## Eisenhower Talk Slashes 'Gloom, Doom Peddlers' 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (UP)—President Eisenhower assured the
people tonight he will use "every legitimate means" to sustain
the nation's prosperity, and lashed out at "the self-appointed ped
dlers of- gloom and doom" who predict a recession.
He also declared that the legislative program he will send to

Congress in his State of the Union
message Thursday is devoted to the
welfare of all Americans and "does
not deal in pie-in-the-sky promises
to all, nor in bribes to a few, nor
in threats to any."
In a 15-minute television and
radio report to the nation, Mr.
Eisenhower acknowledged that cer
tain economic adjustments arc nec
essary in changing times. But he
said they can be made without "the
economic chaos for which the Com
munists hope."
Asserting that the administra
tion is ready to move in "at a
moment's notice" to protect "the
basic prosperity," he said:
"I therefore give you this as
surance:
"Every legitimate means avail
able to the federal government
that can be used to sustain that
prosperity is being used and will
continue to be used ass necessary."
The President's speech was the
first of a series he will give Congress
and the public as the lawmakers
tackle what could be a make-or
break session for the Republicans in
this fall's, elections.
Mr. Eisenhower and his cabinet
spent 2M> hours with GOP congres
sional leaders earlier today going
over the radio-TV speech and the
State of the Union message he will
deliver in person to a joint session
of Congress at 12:30 p.m., EST.
Thursday.
Mr. Eisenhower did not go into
any details of his legislative program
in the radio-TV speech. But he said
it "represents the philosophy of
government by and for the people"
and predicted it "will meet with
your approval."
More than a fourth of the Presi
dent's address was devoted to re
viewing accomplishments of his
administration during the past
year. As had the White House in
a previous announcement, Mr.
Eisenhower referred to the end of
the Korean fighting, reductions in
government spending, removal of
economic controls and a halt in
skidding farm prices.
He also referred to his atoms-for
peace plan "to help end the climate
of suspicion and fear that excites
nations to war."
He said his administration also
has laid the "groundwork" for still
another accomplishment—quick re
medial action in event of an eco
nomic slump.
"This administration believes that
we must not and need not tolerate
a boom-and-bust America,"he
said. "We believe that America's
prosperity docs not and need not de
pend upon war or the preparation
for war.
"Sound planning and aggressive
enterprise must, of course, he ac
companied by the indispensable
ingredient— a persistent and rea
soned faith in the growth and
progress of America, a faith which
cannot be shaken by self - ap
pointed peddlers of gloom and
doom."
The President indicated he may be
thinking of reviving the "fireside
chats" of the late President Roose
velt.
In any case, he served notice that
he and other administration leaders
will keep the public informed on the
progress of their legislative program
in Congress.
