## Solons Will Reconvene 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 (UP)—
The narrowly divided 83rd Con
' gress begins its make-or-break
second session tomorrow with
President Eisenhower reported
ready to fight if necessary to
put across his 1954 program.
The House and Senate convenc at
noon. No serious business is ex
pected before Thursday when the
President will jay down the broad
outlines of his program in his State
of the Union message to a joint ses
sion of both houses. '
Mr. Eisenhower gave Democratic
leaders of both houses a preview of
his defense and foreign policy plans
at a 2'/2-hour White House confer
ence today. Republican leaders,
who have seen the plans before, also
attended.
Democrats said little after the
conference, which included spe
cial reports by Secretary of State
John Foster Dulles, Defense Scc
vctary Charles E. Wilson, and Har
old E. Stasscn, foreign aid chief.
But House Democratic Whip John
W. McCormack told newsmen Dem
ocrats were not "consulted" about
any of the decisions made by the
administration. "It was a briefing,
rather than a consultation," he said.
Mr. Eisenhower had advertised
the conferences as a move to win
bipartisan support for his defense
and foreign policy program. He also
has made clear he believes the GOP
must stand or fall next November
on the record Congress makes.
Highly placcd Democrats who
attended the meeting said they
were shown only a few pages of
the President's State of the Un
ion message, and the talk was in
"generalities." No specific rec
ommendations were mentioned.
Democratic leaders said they are
not pledged to support the Presi
dent. They said their present in
tention is to vote for programs they
have supported in the past—foreign
aid, social security improvements, a
liberal trade program, and others.
They said there was considerable
discussion at the White House of
the President's announced plans to
withdraw two U.S. divisions from
Korea—plans which have disturbed
some Democrats.
