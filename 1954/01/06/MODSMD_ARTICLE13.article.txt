| opportunity to visit each fraternity.
, (Last year Lower and Upper Row
i houses were open two days at al
ternate times, followed by one night
when all fraternities were open.)
"All rushaes are urged to visit
every house and make each visit
fairly short to enable them to make
the best use of the longer open
house period," commented Gene
Dils, Interfraternity Council presi
dent.
When formal rushing begins, there
will be unlimited social contact be
tween fraternity men and rushees.
Dinners, luncheons, parties, and
other get-togethers usually com

said.

A threat many invitations havr
already been sent to freshmen
conccrning dates during formal

to send these invitations back until
after Thursday night's open
houses, Dils said. This will allow
a chance to see some of the houses

Stanford fraternities will throw open their doors to freshmen
tonight at 7:30 as the houses begin an intensive, 11-day rushing
period. The first five days are devoted to open houses after which
formal rushing will take place. All formal rushing ends Jan. 16
with pledge signing.
This year, all rushees will visit Upper and Lower Row alter-

nately in two groups—those with
last names A-M and N-Z. Rushees
will go to open houses in accordance
with this alphabetical grouping for
four days. In addition there will be
two more open house periods dur -
ing which any fraternity may be
visited.
Open houses will take place ac
cording to the following schedule:
Today, Jan. «, 7:30 to 9:45 (A-M
visit Upper Row, N-Z, Lower
Row); Thursday, Jan. 7, 7:30 to
!(:4.» (A-M visit Lower Row, N-Z,
Upper Row); Friday, Jan. 8, 7:30
to !J:l5 (A-M visit Upper Row, N-
Z, Lower Row); Saturday, Jan. 0,
7:30 to 9:45, and Sunday, Jan. 10,
2:30 to 5. Saturday and Sunday
rushees may go to houses on cither
Upper or Lower Row.
The open house period this year
i3 longer than it has been in the
past in order to give freshmen morr:
| opportunity to visit each fraternity.
, (Last year Lower and Upper Row
i houses were open two days at al
ternate times, followed by one night
when all fraternities were open.)
"All rushaes are urged to visit
every house and make each visit
fairly short to enable them to make
the best use of the longer open
house period," commented Gene
Dils, Interfraternity Council presi
dent.
When formal rushing begins, there
will be unlimited social contact be
tween fraternity men and rushees.
Dinners, luncheons, parties, and
other get-togethers usually com
prise the formal rushing period, Dili,
said.
Pledge card signing will occur at
11 a.m. Saturday, Jan. IB at the
Women's Clubhouse, at which time
formal rushing comes to an end.
Rushing activities, however, will
continue throughout the year but on
a smaller scale.
A threat many invitations havr
already been sent to freshmen
conccrning dates during formal
rushing. Freshmen are urged not
to send these invitations back until
after Thursday night's open
houses, Dils said. This will allow
a chance to see some of the houses
before accepting invitations.
