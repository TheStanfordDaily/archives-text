# Clubs Host '57 Men At Open House
## 
### 
The men of the Class of 1957
got their first formal look at Stan
ford's seven eating clubs last
night at the first of three club
rushing open houses. The clubs
will hold open houses for the
freshmen tomorrow night and
again Tuesday, 8 to 10 p.m.
Club freshmen rushing began at
the end of finals week last quarter,
with individual clubs holding va
cation rushing parties, but last
night's was the first rushing event
sponsored by Interclub Council.
All seven clubs were open to fresh
man visitors throughout the evening.
Refreshments were served.
Unlimited social contact between
clubmen and freshmen is now in
effect; eating club members are free
to visit freshmen in their living
units. Club pledging activities are
now going on, and are left up to the
discretion of individual clubs.
ICC President Buzz Feinberg
points out that eating club procedure
differs in these respects from fra
ternity procedure this year. The
Row has changed its rushing pro
cedure to some extent for 1954.
The seven Stanford eating clubs
are Los Arcos, Breakers, El Campo,
El Capitan, El Cufidro, El Tigre, and
El Toro. The club building is lo
cated just north of Toyon Hall.
