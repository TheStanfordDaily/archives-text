BERLIN, Jan. 5 West
ern commanders in the
Soviet chief here to meet with them
Thursday to pick the building for
'the meeting of Big Four foreign
ministers Jan. 25.
U.S. High Commissioner James B.
Conant announced that the Western
powers had cheeked to their Berlin
commands the completing of ar
rangements for the conference.
The American, British, and
French commanders wrote S. A.
Dengin, chief of the Soviet control
commission, proposing the meeting
Thursday morning to mop up the
"technical preparations."
The only known point raising any
likelihood of dispute was just where
:in Berlin the foreign ministers
should meet.
Informed sources said the West
erners would insist at the prelimi
nary meeting that the conference be
held in the Allied Control Author
ity building.
The Western Big Three, in the
exchange of East-West notes lead
ing up to the agreement on the con
ference, had proposed the Allied
Control Authority builtling in the
U.S. sector.
Without rejecting the proposal,
Russia replied that the selection
should be left up to four-power rep
resentatives meeting in Berlin to
complete the arrangements.
"There is only one logical place
to hold a four-power meeting, and
that is in the former Control Au
thority building," a Western official
said today.
"It is the only building that could
be considered neutral ground.
Some observers saw a possibility
the Russians would propose that at
least some of the sessions be held
in Soviet, headquarters in the
Karlshorst area of Berlin or in the
Soviet embassy on Untcr den Lin
den.
The Western authorities seemed
confident that their choice would
prevail. Workmen already were ti
dying up and preparing the Control
Authority building.
