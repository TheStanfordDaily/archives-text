# Entire Italian Cabinet Quits
## 
### 
ROME, Jan. 5 (UP)—ltalian Pre
mier Giuseppe Pella and his entire
cabinet resigned tonight following
criticism that he was moving his
government too far to the right by
dealing with the Monarchists.
The resignation was submitted to
President Luigi Einaudi but he re
served decision on whether to ac
cept it.
Pella, who succeeded Alcide dc
Gasperi as premier four and one
half months ago, quit over demands
from his own Christian Democratic
party that he bring his right-wing
government back to the middle of
the road.
The dispute between Pella and
his party brought Italy to the brink
of a cabinet crisis resembling the
perennial political chaos of France.
The 51-year-old premier called a
surprise meeting of his ministers a
few hours after the Christian Dem
ocratic exccutivc council handed
him . a virtual ultimatum.
After the meeting, he called on
Einaudi to turn in his government's
resignation.
Einaudi, a 79-ycar-old statesman
who taught Pella economics in col
lege and installed him as premier
last August, put off acceptance of
the resignation.
The dispute leading up to Pella's
resignation traces back to the Ital
ian general elections of last June
in which the Christian Democrats—
Italy's foremost bulwark against
Communism — lost ground to par
ties of the right and left. ,
Support from the Monarchists
helped install Pella as premier after
a parliamentary confidence vote
ousted De Gasperi, the veteran
Christian Democratic leader. It was
this Monarchist support which an
gered Christian Democrats and led
to the resignation.
