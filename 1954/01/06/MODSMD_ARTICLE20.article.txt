### DICK MANSFIELD 
As long as there seems to be nothing else to do
thiii quarter, let us consider a riddle:
What is it that has a roof but no floor or walls,
that was carefully painted to blend with the trees
around it to the point where you have to look hard
to see it, which with a back on it would be a fair

country peanut stand, which if
it were removed would look very
much as it is now, and which as
it is now, looks very much as
though it. weren't. Hint: All this
cos*t our University twelve hun
dred dollars.
The answer comes as a stran
gled cry from student and Plan
ning Office alike: The Palm
Drive rides shelter.
One year ago, Alpha Plii

Omega docided that it was time to do something
for the wretched masses huddled in the rain at the
end of Palm Drive, waiting for rides to the Village.
So they started the ball rolling. Early consideration
of the project resulted in recommendations that
the shelter be (a) inconspicuous and (b) re
movable. Bluntly put, the thing promised to be an
eyesore.
The Planning Office wks told to draw something
that would conform with University architecture.
A Phi O" submitted a couple of sketches of what
they assumed was a ride shelter: three walls, pitched
roof, benches inside, and so on.
The Planning Office submitted four different draw
ings before one was accepted. There are those who
would accept the j-umor that the fourth and last
plan was drawn up by an art student who thought
he was doing an abstract. A philosophical attitude
is needed when establishing a connection between a
ride shelter—plain old ride shelter with three walls,
pitched roof, benches inside, and so on, and the*
Stanford Palm Drive ride shelter.
"It makes a dandy safeguard against falling palm
branches," someone says.

On the other hand, it doesn't apear to have much
practical value in a rainstorm with gusty wind.
You see, the ride shelter (Palm Drive version) is
a flat roof set on eight posts, with a gravel floor
and no hack.
"Man! A natural wind tunnel!" says someone else.
The Planning Commission insisted that the shelter
be painted exactly the color of the palm trees, in
brder to blend. And on the first warm day in spring,
or before, that ride shelter will be spirited away to
the Corp Yard, to spend the sunny summer months
indoors. The fa£t that the ride shelter won't be
there when the late spring monsoons are isn't as
important as the fact that the thing wouldn't do much
sheltering if it were there.
"It gives the Village people a place to gather to
discuss their plight," someone has pointed out.
Alpha Phi Omega kicked in $450 for the project,
drawing from its book exchange fund. It seems as
though the service fraternity could have built the
shelter themselves for half the price and with a mini
mum of labor. When the trustee-approved plans
were passed around at A Phi O meeting, there were
a few chuckles and a sad plaint of "There must be
some mistake!" But that $450 didn't stand alone;
the University added $750 to meet the $1200 price
set by the contractor, Stanford's own Corp Yard.
Theoretically, the University took bids on the proj
ect; a bid of seventeen cents by the carpentry-minded
Sigma Nu's was hastily turned down. Right now,
the Sigma Nu's probably wouldn't buy the thing for
that price.
Some suggestions have been advanced, i.e.:
(1) Board it up front and back and make it into a
new men's dormitory.
(2) Next year, throw it on the bonfire.
(3) Even better, when Cal brings down its bomb
for next year's bonfire, talk them into leaving it in
the ride shelter.
It isn't an eyesore, being virtually invisible. It
isn't an obstruction, being several muddy steps from
the edge of Palm Drive. And it most certainly isn't
a shelter.

The answer comes as a stran
gled cry from student and Plan
ning Office alike: The Palm
Drive rides shelter.
One year ago, Alpha Plii

Omega docided that it was time to do something
for the wretched masses huddled in the rain at the
end of Palm Drive, waiting for rides to the Village.
So they started the ball rolling. Early consideration
of the project resulted in recommendations that
the shelter be (a) inconspicuous and (b) re
movable. Bluntly put, the thing promised to be an
eyesore.
The Planning Office wks told to draw something
that would conform with University architecture.
A Phi O" submitted a couple of sketches of what
they assumed was a ride shelter: three walls, pitched
roof, benches inside, and so on.
The Planning Office submitted four different draw
ings before one was accepted. There are those who
would accept the j-umor that the fourth and last
plan was drawn up by an art student who thought
he was doing an abstract. A philosophical attitude
is needed when establishing a connection between a
ride shelter—plain old ride shelter with three walls,
pitched roof, benches inside, and so on, and the*
Stanford Palm Drive ride shelter.
"It makes a dandy safeguard against falling palm
branches," someone says.

On the other hand, it doesn't apear to have much
practical value in a rainstorm with gusty wind.
You see, the ride shelter (Palm Drive version) is
a flat roof set on eight posts, with a gravel floor
and no hack.
"Man! A natural wind tunnel!" says someone else.
The Planning Commission insisted that the shelter
be painted exactly the color of the palm trees, in
brder to blend. And on the first warm day in spring,
or before, that ride shelter will be spirited away to
the Corp Yard, to spend the sunny summer months
indoors. The fa£t that the ride shelter won't be
there when the late spring monsoons are isn't as
important as the fact that the thing wouldn't do much
sheltering if it were there.
"It gives the Village people a place to gather to
discuss their plight," someone has pointed out.
Alpha Phi Omega kicked in $450 for the project,
drawing from its book exchange fund. It seems as
though the service fraternity could have built the
shelter themselves for half the price and with a mini
mum of labor. When the trustee-approved plans
were passed around at A Phi O meeting, there were
a few chuckles and a sad plaint of "There must be
some mistake!" But that $450 didn't stand alone;
the University added $750 to meet the $1200 price
set by the contractor, Stanford's own Corp Yard.
Theoretically, the University took bids on the proj
ect; a bid of seventeen cents by the carpentry-minded
Sigma Nu's was hastily turned down. Right now,
the Sigma Nu's probably wouldn't buy the thing for
that price.
Some suggestions have been advanced, i.e.:
(1) Board it up front and back and make it into a
new men's dormitory.
(2) Next year, throw it on the bonfire.
(3) Even better, when Cal brings down its bomb
for next year's bonfire, talk them into leaving it in
the ride shelter.
It isn't an eyesore, being virtually invisible. It
isn't an obstruction, being several muddy steps from
the edge of Palm Drive. And it most certainly isn't
a shelter.

As long as there seems to be nothing else to do
thiii quarter, let us consider a riddle:
What is it that has a roof but no floor or walls,
that was carefully painted to blend with the trees
around it to the point where you have to look hard
to see it, which with a back on it would be a fair

country peanut stand, which if
it were removed would look very
much as it is now, and which as
it is now, looks very much as
though it. weren't. Hint: All this
cos*t our University twelve hun
