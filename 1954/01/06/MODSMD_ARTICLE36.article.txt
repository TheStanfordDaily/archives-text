## ON THE SLOPES 
### 
Winter quarter, almost by defini
tion, means treks to the slopes, par
kas, Norwegian ski boots, sitzmarks,
chair lifts, peeling noses, and auto
graphed casts. Although i*t the
present time, ski are|s jotted with
menacing stumps, fdt-l/s, and logs
still outnumber those in which the
snow has covered induce
ments to broken limbs, within a few
weeks the skiing should be good.
And so here is a rundown of the
best skiing areas within driving dis
tance:
SQUAW VALLEY: Squaw Val
ley, in the Lake Tahoe area, pos
sesses the finest skiing slopes in
California. It has a double chairlift.
which the management claims is the
longest in the world.
An excellent ski school, which
teaches the Emile Allais parallel
method, is headed by genial Stan
Tomlinson, perfector of the mambo
on skis. His two best instructors are
Joe Mariac, the flying Frenchman,
and Dode Post, captain of the '48
United States women's Olympic
team.

The Squaw Valley Lodge has
been redone, and is vastly more
spacious than it was last year.
However, a warning. The man
agement is trying to make Squaw
Valley the Sun Valley of Califor
nia. Consequently, it is endeav
oring to pitil the society crowd to
Squaw and seems to be forget
ting about the average ski bum.
The food prices compare with
those of the Stork Club and the
food wilh that of the Cellar.
But despite all this. Squaw Val
ley's glistening slopes remain a par
adise for the California skier.
MOUNT ROSE-SLIDE MOUN
TAIN AREA: This is in Nevada,
outside of Reno. Slide Mountain,
which is on the side of Mount Rose
slope, is just being opened this year
and is considered potentially better
than Squaw Valley. However, it
still has to be developed. Mount
Rose is one of the better ski areas,
but, like Slide Mountain, it takes
a long time to drive there.
BADGER PASS, YOSEMITE:
Anyone who has never been to
Yosemite should make at least
one trip there, not only to ski, hut
also to stare goggle-eyed at some
of the most heroic landscape this
side of Switzerland.
Badger Pass, which is a 45-minute
drive from the floor of the Valley,
offers good skiing. It is a haven for
beginners, possessing an ideally
gentle beginners' slope and a top
notch ski school. The head of the
ski school, Norwegian Luggi Foe
ger, whose face is the color of a
well-done Christmas turkey, is one
of the most graceful men ever to
put a pair of the sliding boards on.
He is poetry in motion.
Badger Pass has two rope tows
and a T-bar, which combines the
mechanics of a rope tow and a
chair lift and the advantages of
neither. Better - than - average ski
ers might find the slope boring after
a while, as there isn't a great vari
ety of runs.
SUGAR BOWL: Situated in the
Donncr area, Sugar Bowl has
top - notch slopes and a better
than average ski school. /A new
"Magic Carpet" has been installed
which whips scliussers from the
highway to the Sugar Bowl.
SODA SPRINGS-BEACON HILL:
This area has been improved in re
cent years and is a very good place
for beginners. However, it doesn't
begin to rank with places like
Squaw Valley and Slide Mountain.
DODGE KH)(>K: Its most recom
mending feature is its proximity to
Stanfordâ€”four hours by car. Its run
is better than average, and the ski
school, good. However, the very
fact that Dodge Ridge is close is its
downfall. Dodge Ridge, on a week
end. looks like Coney Island on a
hot day.
See ya on the slopes.
