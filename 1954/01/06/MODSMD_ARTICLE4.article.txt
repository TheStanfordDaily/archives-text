# Stanford Economist Predicts Recession

### BARBARA TUERK 
Despite the stress on optimism in President Eisenhower's Mon
day night speech to the nation, the United States is already in a
recession that will see the number of unemployed grow from
two and a half to over four million before the end of this year,
Stanford's noted economist Theodore J. Kreps predicted confi
dently yesterday.

Commenting on the nation-wide I
address in which the President |
pledged his administration would
not tolerate a "boom - and - bust j
America,"the "only Democratic ;
professor in the Graduate School of |
Business" said it seems clear to him
that "a 1932 depression is not in the j
cards." Mr. Eisenhower, he said, is
not going to wait before "throwing
the full resources of the government
into the fight against depression."
Dr. Kreps, staff director of the
Joint Committee on the Economic
Report under former President
Truman, grinned when he guessed
that the "adjustments" Eisenhow
er alluded to Monday night would
he "just New Deal measures,
that's all."
And, he said, the probable Eisen
hower measures arc the same that
Arllai Stevenson would have taken
if lie had been elected last year, "a
program intelligent Democrats can
support and rabid Republicans may j
not like."
Specifically Dr. Kreps thought
that Eisenhower would probably
call for:
1. Easier credit.
2. State and local public works
programs.
Extended welfare benefits
such as social security and unem
ployment insurance.
4. Tax reduction.
An Eisenhower policy which
Democrats probably will not sup
port is what Dr. Kreps calls "the
federal giveaway programs, encour
aging private companies to develop
oil, power, and land resources."
He also fears that lowered trade
barriers will be a recession casu
alty.
In undertaking this anti-depres
sion program, the Republicans
would be ignoring "a whole host of
their shibboleths," the New Deal
economist explained. Backing up
his faith in the non-partisan nature
of the Republicans' plans, Dr. Kreps
added that the GOP asked him to
come to Washington this year to
advise them on its program.
Among slogans that the Repub
licans have already tossed to the
winds, Dr. Kreps listed: "balanc
ing the budget," "creeping social
ism," "restoring laisscz fairc to
agriculture," and "abolishing so
cial security."
The prominent Democrat said
that Republican party policy was in
no way responsible for the present
recession. "Economics doesn't pay
much attention to politics," he j
smiled.
Promptly and positively he enu- I
merated what he said were the real
causcs of this recession:
1. "Business investment stimulated
by quick tax write-offs has provid
ed enough production to take care
of the next couple of years in such
fields as housing, consumers' dur
ables, and heavy capital production.
2. "The children of the last de
pression are of marriageable age j
now. Because the birth rate was
low then, there will be compara
tively few new families for the
next few years.
3. "Consumer and business bor

rowing has been at an unusually
high level. The 'sound dollar' is
bound to mean reduction of credit.
4. "Our large export market is
being cut into very substantially
by the efforts of Great Britain and
others to hoard their dollars, and

by the diminution of American
loans abroad.
5. "Farm buying power is re
duced and likely to stay down. You
can't readjust farm surpluses eas
ily"
All these factors make a reces
sion unavoidable, the economist
explained, predicting further that
it will last through 1955. "We're
not going to have a quick end to
this one," he added.
Dr. Kreps said, however, that
even without the special measures
President Eisenhower has indicated
that he will take, other permanent
reforms of the 1930's make a really
disastrous depression unlikely.
Again listing off the reasons for
his opinion in a quick, confident
tone, Dr. Kreps cited as permanent
bulwarks against a new depression:
banking insurance, the federal se
curities laws, farm price supports,
social security, unemployment com
pensation, federal home insurance,
and labor union strength.
