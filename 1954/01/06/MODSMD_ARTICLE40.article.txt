# Olie Suzdaleff Injures Leg, But May Play Against SC
## Tomsic's Injury Still Uncertain 
### 
Another injury jolted Stanford
basketball hopes yesterday afternoon
when Olie Suzdaleff pulled up with
a lame right leg.
But the Cards' play-maker and
co-captain should be ready to go at
his starting guard slot against
Southern California in Los Angeles
over the week end, a Palo Alto doc
tor reported last night.
Ron Tomsic, the other Indian
hoopster on the invalid list, will
probably know his fate by the end
of the week. Tomsic, the team's
best shot, is now testing the leg
he injured during the holidays.
If the leg does not hold up, the
doctors may operate Friday, forcing
Tomsic out of action for the season.
Barry Brown, a sophomore transfer,
is holding down Tomsic's forward
position.
Suzdaleff pulled the ligaments in
his right knee during practice drills
in the Pavilion.
It was first feared that the key
Card hall-hawk would be out of
the Cal season next week as well
as the SC tilts, but the doctors
think he will be able to play Fri
day.
If SuzdalefT has to sit out the
games in the Southland, Ron Wag
ner, the holler-guy and captain of
last year's frosh team, is expected
to fill in. Wagner, at 5-10, is an
other of Coach Bob Burnett's small
basketballers.
