He said the statement had been
agreed to by those present. He said
i the Democrats were not filled in on
the President's domestic program.
The President faces a stiff fight
in getting some of his proposals cn
| acted.
Democrats have a numerical nia
; jority of 48 to 47 in the Senate, with
independent Wayne Morse of Ore
gon holding the balance.
The Republicans hold a razor
thin majority in the House—2l9 to
215, with one independent. But it

I tion.
Informed sources said Mr. Eisen
hower is taking a firm lead on con-
I troversial issues this year—in con-
I trast to the "give and take" policy
he pursued last year. He is said to

sive" program against the more con
servative wing of his party.
It is understood that the Presi
dent will lay heavy stress on sweep
ing social security and housing rec
ommendations, among others. He

; opposition on these and other mat-
I ters from conservative Republicans.
