# Mealtime Saga
## 
### 
Stanford hashers are the lucki
est of individuals. They alone
have the pleasure of serving pin
curled, pasty-faced coeds break
fast, balancing trays of glasses
piled up like the Eiffel Tower,
clearing tables by the light of a
wavering candle, and waiting pa
tiently while that last girl sips her
tea, so very slowly.
The above pictures are typical
campus mealtime scenes. If, after
looking at them carefully, you
till feel you really need that
hashing job, you may sign up
with Miss Ricker in the Union
dining hall office. Approximately
350 students hashed last quarter,
and vacancies arc given to those
with real need.
The pictures, top to bottom,
left to right, show:
1. Lagunita hashers Ann Con
stant, Peggy Figg-Hoblyn, and
Ann White cat lunch. Note the
eager, happy expressions on their
faces.
2. D o t Bo w m a n and Stc<t
Weitzman dishing up a special
Friday night treat—scallops.
3. Scallops need tartar sauce,
and Lagunita hasher Ralph Dillcy
isn't quite sure if he should risk
bending over to pick up an in
dividual serving.
4. Everyone looks happy as
Maurice Hind and Pat Post serve
the entrees. Again, the scene is
Lagunita's dining room.
5. A clean-up committee of one
—that's what Stern hasher George
YVeintz feels like as he shoulders
a tray and heads for the kitchen.
fi. Over at the Thcta Xi house,
the procedure is much the same,
but the table is larger. Here the
hasher is Mike McGinnis.
7. Nothing can be as noisy as a
dish crew at work. Apparently
enjoying themselves as they stack
plates for the dishwasher arc Dick
Love, Lcs Brooks, and Joe Dic
k em per.
X. Dinner is over at Encina. and
Norman Gauss sweeps up the re
mains while a friend lends moral
support.
J). Another meal, another day.
And a weary hasher heads home.
