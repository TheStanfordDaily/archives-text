# Freak Storms Rage in Europe
## 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 5 (UP)â€”East Ger
many battled the worst Baltic Sea
floods in 40 years today as gale
driven seas pounded Europe's
coastal defenses and snowstorms
coated the continent white as far
south as the toe of Italy.
At least 20 persons died in weather
accidents. Nine vessels sent out dis
tress calls. A Greek freighter was
hurled into a mudbank in the North
Sea and the captain refused to leave
his leaking, wave-buffeted ship.
Winds of up to 100 miles an hour
ripped over Europe, toppled giant
steel cranes and flattened railroad
cars in the storms which raged only
two days before the onslaught of the
peak spring tides.
