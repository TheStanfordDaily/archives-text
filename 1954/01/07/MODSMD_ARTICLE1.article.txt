# RUSS OKAY ATOM TALKS
## To Meet In Washington 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 (UP)â€”
Russia agreed today to hold pre
liminary talks here on President
Eisenhower's atoms - for - peace
plan, and the State Department
said the negotiations will get
under way "at an early date."
Russia's action was announced in
a Soviet foreign ministry announce
ment published in the government
newspaper Izvestia and confirmed
by the State Department. The De
partment said:
"Secretary (John Foster) Dulles
expects to proceed at an early date
to have the procedural conversa
tions which the Soviet government
has indicated would be acceptable
to it."
State Department spokesman
Henry Suydam said Dulles sug
gested the Washington talks to
Charles E. Bohlen, U.S. ambassa
dor to Moscow, who relayed the
proposal to Soviet Foreign Minis
ter V. M. Molotov.
The Soviet announcement said
Georgi Zarubin, Russian ambassa
dor to the United States, would rep
resent his government in the Wash
ington talks which will be aimed at
laying the groundwork for top-level
discussions later.
The Soviet and U.S. announce
ments came a few hours after
fiohlcn called on Molotov in Mos
cow at the request of the Russian
official.
An American embassy spokes
man there said the meeting was
"connected with (he ambassador's
last visit to Molotov Dec. Ill" when
llnhlcn expressed 1 his country's
willingness to begin preliminary
talks on Mr. Eisenhower's plan.
Under the plan, designed to break
the long atomic stalemate between
the two main cold war antagonists,
the United States, Russia, Britain,
and Canada would contribute fis
sionable materials to an interna
tional atomic pool for peaceful pur
poses.
Russia said later it would be will
ing to discuss the proposal
coupled the announcement with the
usual Communist demand for an
outright ban on use of atomic weap
ons in any future war. Such a ban
would play directly into the hands
of Russia with its massive ground
armies.
