# State of Union Message Today
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 (UP)—
The narrowly-divided 83rd Con
gress opened its make-or-break
election-year session today with
the Republican leadership de
claring it "may have to" get
along with the Democrats.
Handshakes anc7 slaps on the back
prevailed as members of the House
and Senate convened a session that
will pass on President Eisenhower's
1954 legislative program and go far
toward deciding the November
Congressional elections.
But the sweetness and light
merely masked storm clouds piling
up over such controversial issues as
taxes, farm policy, Taft - Hartley
amendments, foreign trade, social
security, and the administration's
military policies.
The Senate met for 26 minutes
and the House for 78 minutes to
swear in new members and con
duct other routine business. Then
they adjourned until tomorrow
when Mr. Eisenhower will deliver
his State of the Union message at
a.m., PST.
The Republican olive branch was
extended to the Democrats by GOP
House Leader Charles A. iialleck
(Ind.) in a brief speech congratu-

President Eisenhower's State of
the Union address to Congress,
jointly assembled, will be broad
cast and televised on all major
networks today at !)::J0 a.m.
(PST). Much of Eisenhower's
final draft of the message was
written during his holiday vaca
tion in Augusta, Georgia.

lating House Democratic Leader
Sam Rayburn (Tex.) on his 72nd
birthday.
Mindful that the Republicans are
a minority in the Senate and hold
only razor - thin control of the
House, Halleck remarked:
"Things being what they arc, I
may have to kind of get along (with
Rayburn)."
The political lineup of the
House is 219 Republicans, 215
Democrats, and one independent.
In the Senate it is 48 Democrats,
47 Republicans, and one inde
pendent. Administration Repub
licans know they must have some
Democratic support to push across
Mr. Eisenhower's program.
This was emphasized by the fact
that for the first time in history
Congress opened a session in which
the Senate majority leader, in this
case Sen. William F. Knowland
(Calif.), did not have a majority.
The nearest precedent was in .1881
when the Senate was evenly di
vided, 37 to 37, and the Vice-Presi
dent broke the tic.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 (UP)—
The narrowly-divided 83rd Con
gress opened its make-or-break
election-year session today with
the Republican leadership de
claring it "may have to" get
along with the Democrats.
Handshakes anc7 slaps on the back
prevailed as members of the House
and Senate convened a session that
will pass on President Eisenhower's
1954 legislative program and go far
toward deciding the November
Congressional elections.
But the sweetness and light
merely masked storm clouds piling
up over such controversial issues as
taxes, farm policy, Taft - Hartley
amendments, foreign trade, social
security, and the administration's
military policies.
The Senate met for 26 minutes
and the House for 78 minutes to
swear in new members and con
duct other routine business. Then
they adjourned until tomorrow
when Mr. Eisenhower will deliver
his State of the Union message at
a.m., PST.
The Republican olive branch was
extended to the Democrats by GOP
House Leader Charles A. iialleck
(Ind.) in a brief speech congratu-

President Eisenhower's State of
the Union address to Congress,
jointly assembled, will be broad
cast and televised on all major
networks today at !)::J0 a.m.
(PST). Much of Eisenhower's
final draft of the message was
written during his holiday vaca
tion in Augusta, Georgia.

lating House Democratic Leader
Sam Rayburn (Tex.) on his 72nd
birthday.
Mindful that the Republicans are
a minority in the Senate and hold
only razor - thin control of the
House, Halleck remarked:
"Things being what they arc, I
may have to kind of get along (with
Rayburn)."
The political lineup of the
House is 219 Republicans, 215
Democrats, and one independent.
In the Senate it is 48 Democrats,
47 Republicans, and one inde
pendent. Administration Repub
licans know they must have some
Democratic support to push across
Mr. Eisenhower's program.
This was emphasized by the fact
that for the first time in history
Congress opened a session in which
the Senate majority leader, in this
case Sen. William F. Knowland
(Calif.), did not have a majority.
The nearest precedent was in .1881
when the Senate was evenly di
vided, 37 to 37, and the Vice-Presi
dent broke the tic.
