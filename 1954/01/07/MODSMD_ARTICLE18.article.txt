The year 1953, which just recently cashed in its

sion, then, proudly announces its "Hamburger of the
Year" awards. They go to:

SENATOR JOE MCCARTHY
. . . for his unflagging devotion
to the political future of Sena
tor Joe McCarthy; for his spot
less record ol unsuccess in con
victing a single Communist
after another year of trying;
and for going on a honeymoon,
thereby saving the American
public from McCarthy head
lines for at least one week out
of the 52.

MARSHAL JOSEF STALIN . . . for dying. As
Shakespeare once said, "Nothing became him in life
like his leaving it."

just when Stanford was leading the Rose Bowl race.

knives, shooting, and .spitting at the audience; and

for inspiring one critic to say, "What we need is
4-Dâ€”3-D with a plot."

to throw her assemblage into more possible po
sitions for pictures than an Indian rubber man; all'
she has to do now is learn how to act.

those guys at Stanford are d bunch of bookworms
and cry babies."
COL. BERTIE McCORMICK, owner of the Chi

. . . l'or continuing to display one of the most bril
liant minds of the thirteenth century.
SAM TSAGALAKIS . . . enough said.
WALTER WINCHELL . . . for forgetting that he

twisters.
LOUELLA PARSONS . . . for her unrestrained
efforts to punish the listening public with radio's
most nauseating voice.
