# Buttons Replace White Lines On Crosswalks, Parking Spaces
## 
### DON WEBSTER 
Students returning from
Christmas vacation were greet
ed on campus by a new sight—
white buttons lining pedestrian
crossings and parking spaces.
These buttons are the latest thing
in street markings, according to

Carroll Blacker, Superintendent of
Buildings and Grounds. The Uni
verstity has purchased 2,500 buttons
at 28 cents each, and they are being
installed at all pedestrian crossings
and in the parking lanes on Memo
rial Way.
In the long run, according to
Blacker, the school should save
much money with the new buttons.
His figures indicate that the cost of
"buttoning" a crosswalk is the same
as two paintings of white lines on
the same area. All lines on campus
are repainted every year, so that
after two years the buttons will be
paid for.
"We certainly should get five
years of use out of any single
button," Blacker said, "and ac
cording to the manufacturer they
will last almost indefinitely."
There is little chance of the
Buildings and Grounds Committee
changing its mind and ordering the

buttons taken out. According to
Blacker, they are virtually impos
sible to remove.
When he first received them he
was afraid Palo Alto High School
students might try stealing them for
souvenirs, but he found them unre- |
movable even with a blowtorch.
"The long spike in the center of
each one holds it securely," he said.
"They can be chipped away in little
pieces, but not removed whole."
A few of the buttons were |
placed in the Stern parking lot
last quarter as an experiment, j
The 2,500 buttons Blacker ordered
were as much as the current
budget would allow, but he ex
pects to order enough for all
campus parking spaces eventu
ally.
As to the parking situation in i
several of the campus iot.s. Blacker
sees the buttons as a solution for
obliterated parking lines, lie has
ordered lrom the telephone com- j
pany some old telephone polos :
which will be used as bumpers for
the front of cars. When these are'
received they will be installed with
buttons marking parking areas.
Still another advantage of the
buttons is their superior visibility
at night. They are visible to motor- |
ists even in a driving rain.
At the present time approximately J
halt the pedestrian crossings have
the buttons, but soon the conversion !
job will be completed and all the
white lines on campus will have the
"new look."

2,500 of the new markers and is planning to order still more. A great money-saver, they even
tually will mark all pedestrian crossings and parking lanes. —Daily photo by Jay Becker
