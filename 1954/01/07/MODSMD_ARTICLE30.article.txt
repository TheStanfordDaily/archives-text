# YWCA Playground in Paly Is New Service Project
## 
### ELLEN MANN 
The Community Service Branch of the Stanford YWCA, long
known for its service projects in the area, has initiated something
new in South Palo Altoâ€”a playground for underprivileged chil
dren of all nationalities.
Early last fall a committee headed by Marlee Turner of Lathrop

House began an intense study of*
recreation facilities in Palo Alto,
discovered the need for the
i playground, and started working
j for its establishment. The plans and \
| work have become a reality.
Operated independently bv the
; Stanford YWCA, it has been set up
|as a part-time play center. Three
; times a week Stanford coeds act as
directors. They organize and super
| vise games, handcraft work, picnics, "
| singing, story - telling hours, and
other activities for children ranging
from six to ten years of age.
During rainy weather the play
| ground moves indoors: the min
| ister of a Haptist church in that
vicinity has offered the use of the
church hail to continue the proj
ect during the winter months.
Mothers in the area have received
the playground with enthusiasm
I and relief, according to the Stanford
! coeds participating in the program,
! and dozens of children have already
become users of its facilities.
Any girl interested in this type of
work may contact Bjorg Hansen,
director of the "Y," at the Women's
Clubhouse, or call Ginny Andrea
at Guthrie House.
A reference file of any work done
by the student directors is kept in
the YWCA office and may be used
as a recommendation.
