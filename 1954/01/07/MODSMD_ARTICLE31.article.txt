WASHINGTON, Jan. G (UP)-
Junketing Congressmen spent near
ly $300,000 in "blank cheek" foreign
currency in addition to funds pro
vided by the U.S. government while
traveling overseas this summer and
fall, it was disclosed by Karl M. Le-
Compte (R., la.), chairman of the
House Administration Committee.
LeCompte said he has asked the
chairmen of five House committees
for a report on the so-called "coun
terpart funds" used by globe-trot
ting committee members.
Counterpart funds are money put
up by foreign governments to match
U.S. aid. The Stale Department
hands out the foreign currency on
request to any touring lawmaker
armed with a statement from a
committee chairman that his trip
is in the public interest.
LeCompte was concerned by the
fact that the Congressmen are not
required by law to make an ac
counting of the money to anyone.
On the other hand, Congressional
committees must make a detailed
report on the spending of all appro
priated U.S. funds.
