# PUNTS AND PITCHES

### PETE GROTHE 
Irwin Johnson, Daily sports scribe and water poloist par excellence, was
seated over his Underwood two nights ago. A gleam was in his eyes and a
lightning touch was in his fingers as he typed away at his column.
"I." Johnson announced, "am writing a column telling how great Stan-

ford's basketball team is going to be
this year."
Several fellow molders of public
opinion nodded their agreement.
Johnson paused long enough to smile
at their assent, and then continued
typing.
Then a reporter stepped out of the
phone booth with a five-alarm bul
letin. Sadly, he said, "Olie Suzdaleff
just wrecked his knee . . . out for the
season."
Johnson quietly looked at his col
umn. Then he slowly pulled it out of
the typewriter, crumpled it into a
ball, threw a two-pointer into the
waste paper basket, and walked out
of the Daily Shack.
A report later that night revealed
that Suzdaleff had only suffered knee
strain, and that it was a "good bet
he would be able to play against
Southern Cal this week end."

However, the knee swelled over night, and at last report, SuzdalefT
was hobbling pretty badly. Said Trainer Connie Jarvis yesterday, "Suzda
lefT is very doubtful for USC. We'll be lucky if he's ready for Cal the
week after."
At any rate, even if the hustling co-captain is back for the Bears, the ,
knee condition could hamper his effectiveness for the rest of the season.
A knee injury is the hardest to heal.
The insiders say that darting Ron Tomsic, the Coast's best "little man"
in basketball, will be out for the season. The medics are having Tomsic walk
around on his bad knee to determine how it is holding up. Team physician
Dr. Fritz Roth will examine the knee tomorrow to see whether an operation
will be necessary now.
II it is, that means Tomsic is through for the year. Even if he comes
back, he, like SuzdalefT, won't be at 100 per cent efficiency. Tomsic, a
junior, is the third highest scorer in Stanford history as begins the half
way mark of his basketball career. This statistic, ir itself, reflects his
worth.
And so, the injuries to SuzdalefT and Tomsic are hard blows to the solar
plexus. As publicist Don Liebendorfer remarked yesterday, "If I were an
opposing coach and were asked what two Stanford men I would like to see
out of action, 1 would select Tomsic and SuzdalefT.
Woid has it that Chief Gordy Davis has put a special guard around
Coach Bob Burnett's house, lest he make some rash attempt at his own life.
However, all is not gloom. Alter all, Stanford still is undefeated in nine
outings, which is a good to put the mustard on the bun. Witness the
following scores: Stanford trounced the Alumni. 69 to 56: Washington, 66 to
51 and 63 to 61; Hawaii, 82 to 71; Loyola, 77 to 64; Fresno State, 95 to 70:
College ol Pacific. 78 to 51; Oregon, 85 to 58; and St. Mary's, 63 to 44.
These are all impressive victories, although it must be remembered that
SuzdalefT participated in all of them and Tomsic, all but two.
One of the high spots of the practice season was the development of
soph Harry Brown, a 6 ft. 4'u in. jumping fool for Los Angeles City College.
Brown stepped into the forward spot vacated by Tomsic, and did admirably
well He displayed \i good shooting eye and sensational talent for grab
bing the all-important rebounds. Granted he is no Tomsic in shooting,
but then how many are?
Another pleasant note has been marked improvement of center Russ
Lawler and forward Don DeLong. DeLong has put on about 10 pounds
ol meat since last season, and his jump shots are finding the target with
frightening consistency.
Five-foot-eight George Selleck has proved that he is one of the finest
soph basketball prospects in Stanford history. His quickness, dribbling,
passing, and "basketball sense" are amazing. Selleck has meshed 102
points, which is second only to Lawler's 133.
A final note as Burnett's undefeated underlings romp through their
final practices before the TCC season begins: The Indians have averaged
12 per cent on their shots from the floor, which is a deliriously good
figure.
The surprising Cards are aiming for some big upsets this season, despite
tin? wobbly condition of two extremely important knees.

The surprising Cards are aiming for some big upsets this season, despite
tin? wobbly condition of two extremely important knees.


808 BURNFTT
—Would he make a rash attempt?
Irwin Johnson, Daily sports scribe and water poloist par excellence, was
seated over his Underwood two nights ago. A gleam was in his eyes and a
lightning touch was in his fingers as he typed away at his column.
"I." Johnson announced, "am writing a column telling how great Stan-

ford's basketball team is going to be
this year."
Several fellow molders of public
opinion nodded their agreement.
Johnson paused long enough to smile
at their assent, and then continued
typing.
Then a reporter stepped out of the
phone booth with a five-alarm bul
letin. Sadly, he said, "Olie Suzdaleff
just wrecked his knee . . . out for the
season."
Johnson quietly looked at his col
umn. Then he slowly pulled it out of
the typewriter, crumpled it into a
ball, threw a two-pointer into the
waste paper basket, and walked out
of the Daily Shack.
A report later that night revealed
that Suzdaleff had only suffered knee
strain, and that it was a "good bet
he would be able to play against
Southern Cal this week end."

However, the knee swelled over night, and at last report, SuzdalefT
was hobbling pretty badly. Said Trainer Connie Jarvis yesterday, "Suzda
lefT is very doubtful for USC. We'll be lucky if he's ready for Cal the
week after."
At any rate, even if the hustling co-captain is back for the Bears, the ,
knee condition could hamper his effectiveness for the rest of the season.
A knee injury is the hardest to heal.
The insiders say that darting Ron Tomsic, the Coast's best "little man"
in basketball, will be out for the season. The medics are having Tomsic walk
around on his bad knee to determine how it is holding up. Team physician
Dr. Fritz Roth will examine the knee tomorrow to see whether an operation
will be necessary now.
II it is, that means Tomsic is through for the year. Even if he comes
back, he, like SuzdalefT, won't be at 100 per cent efficiency. Tomsic, a
junior, is the third highest scorer in Stanford history as begins the half
way mark of his basketball career. This statistic, ir itself, reflects his
worth.
And so, the injuries to SuzdalefT and Tomsic are hard blows to the solar
plexus. As publicist Don Liebendorfer remarked yesterday, "If I were an
opposing coach and were asked what two Stanford men I would like to see
out of action, 1 would select Tomsic and SuzdalefT.
Woid has it that Chief Gordy Davis has put a special guard around
Coach Bob Burnett's house, lest he make some rash attempt at his own life.
However, all is not gloom. Alter all, Stanford still is undefeated in nine
outings, which is a good to put the mustard on the bun. Witness the
following scores: Stanford trounced the Alumni. 69 to 56: Washington, 66 to
51 and 63 to 61; Hawaii, 82 to 71; Loyola, 77 to 64; Fresno State, 95 to 70:
College ol Pacific. 78 to 51; Oregon, 85 to 58; and St. Mary's, 63 to 44.
These are all impressive victories, although it must be remembered that
SuzdalefT participated in all of them and Tomsic, all but two.
One of the high spots of the practice season was the development of
soph Harry Brown, a 6 ft. 4'u in. jumping fool for Los Angeles City College.
Brown stepped into the forward spot vacated by Tomsic, and did admirably
well He displayed \i good shooting eye and sensational talent for grab
bing the all-important rebounds. Granted he is no Tomsic in shooting,
but then how many are?
Another pleasant note has been marked improvement of center Russ
Lawler and forward Don DeLong. DeLong has put on about 10 pounds
ol meat since last season, and his jump shots are finding the target with
frightening consistency.
Five-foot-eight George Selleck has proved that he is one of the finest
soph basketball prospects in Stanford history. His quickness, dribbling,
passing, and "basketball sense" are amazing. Selleck has meshed 102
points, which is second only to Lawler's 133.
A final note as Burnett's undefeated underlings romp through their
final practices before the TCC season begins: The Indians have averaged
12 per cent on their shots from the floor, which is a deliriously good
figure.
The surprising Cards are aiming for some big upsets this season, despite
tin? wobbly condition of two extremely important knees.
