It's time lor fisticuffs again. Soon
the Stanford Pavilion will resound
to the impact of leather on skin as
inexperienced but highly aggressive
young men square off against each
other in six minutes of the quickest
and most exciting . port one is likely
to .see around a campus, college
boxing.
Tlie Stanford boxing team, un
der tlie coaching of Hay Lunny,
opens its season against California
next Wednesday at Berkeley. The
following Wednesday, Jan. 21, the
pugilists move into the Pavilion
to open their home reason against
( al Poly.
Looking "flown the line" and siz
ing up the boxers individually,
starting with the heavyweights and
working down to the 125-1 b. class,
we find:
In tin- 1 SO-11». or over class. Hob
Hirkie appears to have the start
in/"; nod in the C'al bouts. Lunny
rates sophomore Hob as an ex
cellent prospect and hopes he
"continues to learn as fast as he
lias." Hirkie is getting stiff com
petition from footballer Joe Long.
As yet, Lunny has found no re
placement in the 177- lb. class for
the graduated Bob Baldocchi.
Tony Wynn, an excellent body
puncher, is the 105-lb. starter. Lun
ny believes that Wynn, out with a
broken jaw last season, has a good
chance to become PCC champ this
year.
At 155 is Lric Hansen. Hansen
is an excellent boxer and punch

er, who fights with a windmill
style and appears to he throwing
a hundred punches a minute. At
that rate, think what he can do
to an opponent in six minutes.
Jack Owens is the 145-lb. man.
Last year Jack won the Northern
California Intercollegiate title in his
division. This year the left-handed
Owens, whose fraternity brothers
have dubbed him with the fighting
name ol Cholo. has set his sights
i one notch higher, a PCC champion
ship.

Fred Dittmer will light at 1.'!!)
pounds. lie is very inexperienced,
l»til liis aggressiveness is going to
win him his share of fights.
Tough luck Gary Sievert rounds
out the squad at 133 pounds. Last
year Gary, one of the best fighters
on the squad, had the misfortune of
running into the oppositions' best
boxers all season ,long. This should
be his year.
Lunny must forfeit the 125-lb.
class unless he finds a featherweight
in the next few weeks.
