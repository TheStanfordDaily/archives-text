# Suzdaleff Won't Play In Trojan Cage Games
## 
### IRWIN JOHNSON 
Coach Bob Burnett, his usual j
smiling enthusiasm missing, an
nounced yesterday afternoon that
his Card basketball team will defi
nitely play without co-captain Oleg
Suzdaleff in the two games with
USC this weekend.
'the likeable little senior from
San Francisco injured his knee
during practice Tuesday after
noon and was for ->ome time

feared out of action for the sea
son. Burnett saiii yesterday, how
ever, that SuzdalefT would prob
ably be ready for Cal next week.
He added a note of caution to his
prediction, say in,?, "You can never
tell about knee injuries, though."
When asked for some indication
of how the team would do against
the Trojans, Burnett, himself a
crack eager for Stanford in the
late 'thirties and early 'forties, shook
his head. '"We'll be behind the
eight-ball in Los Angeles. We'll

have three sophomores, one junior,
and one senior in our starting five.
We'll be lucky to get a split in the
two games."
The starting five will be co-cap- !
tain Don DeLong and Barry Brown
at forwards, six-foot six and a half
inch Russ Lawler at center, and
George Selleck and Hon Wagner at
guards.
Coach Forrest of USC
will counter with the lineup of
Chet Carr, Jack Dunne. Roy Ir
vin. captain Dick Welsh, and Tony
Psaltis. Dunne and I'saltis are
sophs while Carr, Irvin, and
Welsh are only juniors.
The Trojans have had good suc
cess to date, with Dunn and Carr
carrying the scoring burden, Irvin
doing most of the rebounding, and
the two guards setting up most of
the plays.
Stanford will play its customary j
fast break offense and half-court
press defense, two of the biggest i

factors in the Cards' undefeated
record. The other factors are ter
rific team play on both offense and
defense, and the individual play of
DeLong, Brown, Lawler, and Sel
leck. "*
SuzdalcfT. always a fine player,
has been giving excellent per
formances all along, but the play
of the other four has far exceeded
the fondest expectations of the
coaching stall and the fans in
general.
Sellcck especially has received
the plaudits of the crowds in the
first nine games. As a floor man he
is right now the equal of USC's star
last year, Kenny Flower. As a scor
er, he is second on the team behind
Lawler, with 102 points in nine
games, an 11.3 average. And as l'or
the indefinable but all - important
factor of determination, Selleck is,
in the words of Burnett, "the finest
competitor I've ever seen in bas
ketball."
