letic Association at its meeting this !
month.
2. Passed a rule that in the event
a member institution of the PCC
withdraws from the PCC, the other

3. Strengthened the "gag" rule
on coaches, including a restric

ground rules before a baseball
game.
4. Clarified the rule limiting i
teams and students to 27 basketball j
games and 30 baseball games (ex- j
elusive of post - season tourna- |

meeting at Spokane in June the
problem of televising football games
