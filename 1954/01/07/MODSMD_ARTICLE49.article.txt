# WATER PROJECT
## Knight Urges Full Support 
### 
OROVILLE, Calif., Jan. 6 (UP)â€”
Gov. Goodwin J. Knight tonight
urged the placing of the state's full
credit behind the Feather River
project.
Knight, in a speech to the Cham
ber of Commerce here, said he felt
"consideration should be given" the
use of general obligation bonds in
financing the 600-mile Oroville-to-
San Diego water project. Because
the general obligation bonds would
be secured by the full credit of the
state, they would require less in
terest than straight revenue bonds.
