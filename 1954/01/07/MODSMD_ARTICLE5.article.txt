# POW DISPUTE
## Taylor Threatens ROK's With Use of U.S. Troops 
### 
SEOUL, Korea, Thursday, Jan. 7 (UP) â€”The confused Korean war
prisoner situation took a sudden, unexpected turn today after Gen.
Maxwell D. Taylor threatened to throw American troops against
South Korean soldiers if they attempted to "liberate" 22,000 anti-
Communist POWs.
Stunned South Korean officials maintained an uneasy silence

and refused to comment on the"
U.S. 8th Army Commander's
blunt warning.
Taylor issued a sharply worded
statement yesterday in which he
"noticed" ROK Foreign Minister
Pyun Yung Tae threatened to take
action if Indian custodial troops
continued their "illegal screening"
of the prisoners.
The American general said South
Korea's allegations against the In
dian officers were "groundless" and
warned that if the ROK's intervened
in the touchy situation the U.N.
would "discharge its full responsi
bility" under terms of the armistice
agreement.
The agreement provided that
the U.N. would use troops for
"preventing and restraining any
armed forces . . . from any act
of disturbance and intrusion
against the locations of the pris
oners of war in custody."
Pyun and other top South Korean
officials, including President Syng
man Rhee, were not available for
comment.
The seriousness of the situation
was highlighted by Taylor's an
nouncement that he would fly to
Tokyo immediately for conferences
with U.S. Far East Commander Gen.
John E. Hull.
South Korea threatened to take
"violent action" against Indian
troops guarding the prisoners be
cause of an Indian "administrative
checkup" last Thursday which re
sulted in 1115 Chinese being sent
back to Communism.
Pyun protested the "screening"
as a "criminal action in violation of
the armistice agreement." But the
U.N. command said the Indian ac
tion was "in conformity" with the
agreement.
Disposition of the 22,200 disputed
prisoners, held in a neutral zone
stockade north of Munsan, was the
basis of strong disagreement be
tween the U.N. and Communist
commands.
The Allies continued to main
tain thai all of the I'OW's should
be released by Jan. 215 under
terms of the armistice but the
Itcds said they should be held
until the linal Korean peace con
ference established their fate.
Meanwhile, the Indian command
announced cancellation of a Neu
tral Nations Repatriation Commis
sion meeting scheduled for today.
Neither the U.N. nor Red com
mands replied yesterday to a "final"
commission request that both sides
reach agreement on release of the
prisoners, and cancellation of fur
ther commission meetings followed.
