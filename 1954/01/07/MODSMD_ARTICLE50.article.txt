# New Atom Gun to Combat Cancer
## 
### 
A small linear accelerator is i
being built to combat cancer by '
Stanford microwave specialists.
Part of this accelerator is a glass-;
enclosed gun, already com-1
pleted, which will fire six-mil-!
lion-volt electron "bullets" at!
cancers.
Engineers from the General Elec
tric Company X-ruy department in
Milwaukee will study this and other
types of Stanford linear accelerators
in preparation for manufacturing
them commercially under a new
agreement with the University.
The gun will be attached to a six
foot copper tube through which
electrons, accelerated by super
high-frequency radio waves from a
klystron tube, will fly toward their
target at approximately the speed
of light.
Stanford scientists will install the
completed linear accelerator some
time this year in a specially built
radiation chamber at the Stanford
School of Medicine in San Fran
cisco.
The new chamber will be a small
er, flexible version of Stanford's
one-billion-volt, 200-foot electron
linear accelerator which is now
nearing completion.
Stanford Medical School radiolo
gists will first make exhaustive tests
of the junior-size medical linear ac
celerator with the use of laboratory
animals.
The money for research on the
project, a $24,915 grant, was donated
by the American Cancer Society. It
was presented Monday, Dec. 18, to
Professor Edward L. Ginzton, direc
tor of the Microwave Laboratory,
by Mrs. James Graham Sharp, pres
ident of the Palo Alto unit of the
American Cancer Society.


CANCER GUNâ€”Glass-enclosed "gun" pictured above being tested by Donald Janney, Stanford
graduate student, is part of a linear accelerator being built by Stanford microwave specialists.
The gun will fire six-million-volt electron "bullets" at cancers.
