# Rushing Pace Quickens As Pledging Time Nears
## Fraternities 
### 
A busy weekend is in sight for
fraternity rushers and freshmen as
open houses on the Row continue
through Sunday afternoon. Formal
rushing begins Sunday night at 7
and ends six days later on Saturday,
Jan. 16.
The schedule for the remainder of
the open houses is as follows: to
night, 7:30-9:45 (last names begin
ning with A-M will go to Upper
Row. those with N-Z to Lower
Row): tomorrow, 2:30-5 (A-M go to
Lower (tow, N-Z to Upper Row);
tomorrow, 7:30-9:45-, and Sunday,
2:30-5 (freshmen may go to any
houses they wish).
Beginning Sunday night will be
a series of dinners, luncheons, in
formal get-togethers, and date and
non-date parties at each' of the 23
fraternities.
Bids to houses will he open to
freshmen and pins may be ac
cepted any time after 7 pun. Sun
day. During formal rush week,
men can break their pledges to
their respective houses if they
wish. However, if a plt'dge makes
such a move after Jan. 1(Â», he can
not join another fraternity until
after two quarters of University
residence, including sum m c r
quarter, following the quarter in
which the breaking of the pledge
occurred.
"With these rules in mind, rush
ees are urged not to hurry in mak
ing their decisions about pledging,"
commented Gene Dils, Interfrater
nity Council president. "It is much
better to get to know the members
of a house well, particularly the
sophomores and juniors, before ac
cepting a pin."
On Saturday morning, Jan. lfi,
all pledges will have pledge
brunc li e s at their respective
houses. Following this, at 11 a.m.,
the pledges of each fraternity will
go in a group to the Women's
Clubhouse* where pledge signing
will occur. With this, formal rush
ing will end.
Fraternities, however, will con
tinue to bid new members to a less
er extent throughout the rest of
the school year after rushing is
over.
