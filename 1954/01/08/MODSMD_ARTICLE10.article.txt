# Ex-Card Cage Star Arraigned For Gym Thefts
## 
### 
Don Carlson, sharp-shooting
forward on last year's varsity
basketball squad, admitted steal
ing a number of wallets from En
cina Gym when he was ar
raigned yesterday for petty theft
before Judge Alfred W. Bowen
in the Palo Alto Municipal Court.
Arrested Wednesday, the tall,
blond athlete pleaded guilty to a
complaint filed by the Stanford Po
lice Department which charged him
with the theft of five wallets and a
wrist watch.
He was released on $250 bail,
which was dnoatcd by an unidenti
fied friend. Final sentence was post
poned until next Thursday when
the Santa Clara Probation Depart
ment is expected to submit a report!
on the case.
Though (he complaint filed by
police listed the theft of five wal
lets, Carlson admitted stealing
others when questioned by the
judge.
Carlson told Judge Bowen that
he did not know the exact number
of wallets he might have taken, but
guessed that his thefts netted more
than $100 plus the wrist watch.
He was quoted by police as having
told them that he made four sep
arate rffids through open gym lock
ers.
Police Chief Gordon Davis said the
arrest of Carlson in part solves a
series of locker thefts that began last
March. The chief added that officials
at the gym and police have suspected
Carlson for about three months.
Carlson, mid-way through fall
quarter, was suspended from !
school until spring quarter, for
disciplinary reasons other than the
thefts.
The former basketball star, who
played reserve end on the football
team before his suspension and who |
has been a shot putter, was arrested
after he was caught Wednesday in
the gym with a wallet other than his
own.
Police were called by Jake Irwin,
manager of the Encina Gym store,
who grew suspicious of Carlson
when he saw him loitering in the
locker room.
Irwin, according to a police re
port, hid himself in a lavatory in
the Gym where emptied wallets
had been found in the past. He
waited in hopes that he could
catch the thief disposing of
plucked billfolds.
He waited only a few minutes, |
the report states, when Carlson en- j
tered carrying an extra wallet. When
confronted, the lanky athlete ad
mitted he had taken it from a locker
and had removed $3.
Two other wallets, both empty,
were found discarded in a corner
of the room. Carlson said he had !
earlier removed $10 from one and
$215 from the other.
The judge explained he ordered
a postponement of sentence and a
probation report on Carlson "in
view of the severity of the offense
and the youth of the defendant."
Carlson told officials he lives with
his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Henry
Carlson, San Francisco, and traveled
to the campus frequently "to work
out."
Carlson. 21. was a senior and a
physical education major. He won
his varsity letter in basketball last !
season, during which he played
much of the time on the first string.!

has been a shot putter, was arrested
after he was caught Wednesday in
the gym with a wallet other than his
own.
Police were called by Jake Irwin,
manager of the Encina Gym store,
who grew suspicious of Carlson
when he saw him loitering in the
locker room.
Irwin, according to a police re
port, hid himself in a lavatory in
the Gym where emptied wallets
had been found in the past. He
waited in hopes that he could
catch the thief disposing of
plucked billfolds.
He waited only a few minutes, |
the report states, when Carlson en- j
tered carrying an extra wallet. When
confronted, the lanky athlete ad
mitted he had taken it from a locker
and had removed $3.
Two other wallets, both empty,
were found discarded in a corner
of the room. Carlson said he had !
earlier removed $10 from one and
$215 from the other.
The judge explained he ordered
a postponement of sentence and a
probation report on Carlson "in
view of the severity of the offense
and the youth of the defendant."
Carlson told officials he lives with
his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Henry
Carlson, San Francisco, and traveled
to the campus frequently "to work
out."
Carlson. 21. was a senior and a
physical education major. He won
his varsity letter in basketball last !
season, during which he played
much of the time on the first string.!
Don Carlson, sharp-shooting
forward on last year's varsity
basketball squad, admitted steal
ing a number of wallets from En
cina Gym when he was ar
raigned yesterday for petty theft
before Judge Alfred W. Bowen
in the Palo Alto Municipal Court.
Arrested Wednesday, the tall,
blond athlete pleaded guilty to a
complaint filed by the Stanford Po
lice Department which charged him
with the theft of five wallets and a
wrist watch.
He was released on $250 bail,
which was dnoatcd by an unidenti
fied friend. Final sentence was post
poned until next Thursday when
the Santa Clara Probation Depart
ment is expected to submit a report!
on the case.
Though (he complaint filed by
police listed the theft of five wal
lets, Carlson admitted stealing
others when questioned by the
judge.
Carlson told Judge Bowen that
he did not know the exact number
of wallets he might have taken, but
guessed that his thefts netted more
than $100 plus the wrist watch.
He was quoted by police as having
told them that he made four sep
arate rffids through open gym lock
ers.
Police Chief Gordon Davis said the
arrest of Carlson in part solves a
series of locker thefts that began last
March. The chief added that officials
at the gym and police have suspected
Carlson for about three months.
Carlson, mid-way through fall
quarter, was suspended from !
school until spring quarter, for
disciplinary reasons other than the
thefts.

played reserve end on the football
