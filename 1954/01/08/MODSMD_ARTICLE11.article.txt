# LOS ANGELES TONIGHT
## Injured Indian Quintet Faces Troy in PCC, Tilt 
### IRWIN JOHNSON 
Stanford's undefeated basketball team will fly south this morn
ing to do battle with USC's Trojans tonight and tomorrow night
in the Pan-Pacific Auditorium, depressed by the news that their
high-scoring star, Ron Tomsic, has gone under the knife to cor
rect the knee injury he received in the COP game.
Dr. Fritz Roth operated on the Oakland junior's limb yesterday

morning, and gave out the bad news'
that Tomsic is almost certainly out
for the season.
Coach Bob Burnett suffered an
other crushing blow Tuesday when
co-captain Oleg Suzdaleff also hurt
his knee and was declared out of
this weekend's doubleheader. Suz
daleff will make the trip with the
team, but according to trainer Con
nie Jarvis he has only an outside
chance of being able to play.
The crippling twin loss topples
the Cards from the favorites' role
into a definite underdog position.
Burnett, optimistic to the point of
picking the Indians as possible
champions before losing Tomsic and
Suzdaleff, now admits that his
squad will be lucky to pull a split
out of the two-game series.
In place of his two injured first
stringers Burnett will start Barry
Brown and Ron Wagner, both
sophomores. Brown lias started
the last two games at forward and
lias quelled the cries of the pes
simists who feared the worst
when Tomsic broke down. The
t>-4\2 transfer from Los Angeles
City College has a devastating
jump shot to go with his talents

• as a rebqunder.
Wagner, 5 -10 soph from Oak
land's Fremont High Sciiool basket
ball factory, will open in place of
the cool, experienced SuzdalefT.
"Wag's" shooting and rebounding
aren't spectacular, but he's a hus
tler, and his presence in the lineup
won t break up the outstanding
team play that the Indians have
generated in the games to date.
Don DeLong is slated to start at
the other forward post, teaming up
with Brown on the front end of the
fast break. DeLong has been a
vastly improved and consistent per
former in the first nine games,
At center for the Cards will be
junior Russ Lawler, who has
enough ability to outplay any cen
ter in the conference. Lawler, a
shade under (i-7, hooks with both
hands, tips his teammates' shots
with amazing accuracy, and is
showing deefnsive improvement.
The fifth man for the Indians
I is the sparkplug of tin- fast break,
tin' little floor general, 5-X George
Sellcck. Selleck, a sophomore
from Conipton, is ranked along
