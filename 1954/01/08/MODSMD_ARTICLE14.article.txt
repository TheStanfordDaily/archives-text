# Profs Hopeful, Cautious Of New Russ Atom Talks

### PAT KING 
A feeling of hope tempered by "let's wait and see" was ex
pressed by two Stanford professors yesterday when questioned
on Russia's agreement to discuss the peaceful use of atomic
weapons with State Department officials.
"It is very encouraging that the U.S.S.R. is willing to go

ahead with preliminary talks on
procedural matters," Charles E.
Rothwell, Director of Hoover Insti
tute and Library, commented.
"However," he warned, "so far
there arc no indications that the
Russians have altered their basic
position on the control of atomic
weapons which they formed back
in 194 C."
The research professor ex
plained that essentially the Soviet
Union has demanded legislation
for the immediate outlawing of
atomic weapons. Oil the other
hand, the United States and other
Western nations have favored step
by step developments leading to
the abolition of atomic warfare.
"Now that they are willing to sit
down and talk, it is conceivable that
the differences can be resolved," he
said. "It is a very encouraging thing,
but as yet we can't tell whether or
not they have changed their original
stand."
ALso cautiously hopeful was Rus
sian history professor Anatole G.
Mazour. "They have everything to
gain and nothing to lose from such
talks," he said. "But we won't know
just what this means until after the
meetings are held.
The administering of atomic
pools will pose the greatest prob
lem, Mazour believes. "It is all
so indefinite — who will do the
controlling, just what will be con
trolled, and so forth. And rcmrtn
bcr, this is just a pool of atomic
materials for peace-time use.
Nothing has been said about war
time materials."
"As long as the cold war is in
progress," he continued, "the Rus
sian government must concentrate
on production of war goods and
ignore consumer demands. At
last they have come to the point
when they must talk to case the
tension."
"If agreement on atomic energy is
reached," Mazour concluded, "both
sides will have to give in. The Amer
ican people may be faced with ac
cepting a compromise they won't
like, such as recognizing present So
viet territories in exchange for
atomic security."
