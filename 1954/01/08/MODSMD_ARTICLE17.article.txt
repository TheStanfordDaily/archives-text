# STATE OF THE UNION
## Ike Asks Less Spending, No Tax Cut This Year 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 (UP)—President Eisenhower asked Congress yesterday in his annual
State of the Union message to cut government spending but to forego any general tax cuts this
year.
He also declared to a jam-packed joint session oh the House and Senate that the United States
stands ready to use its "great and growing" stockpile of atomic weapons if necessary to "pre
serve our freedom."
Mr. Eisenhower, speaking slowly and deliberately, appealed to the election-year Congress for
bipartisan support for his scaled-down military program on grounds that new atomic and hydro-

♦gen weapons "permit economies in
I the use of men."
He outlined in his 7,000-word
televised and broadcast address
an atomic-age program for 1954
which he said would make Aim r
j ica stronger and safer against
both Communism and depression
— and with less government
spending.
The President asked that convict
ed Communists be denied citizen
ship and proposed a gradual adop
tion of flexible farm price supports.
To keep the nation strong eco
nomically, Mr. Eisenhower pledged
swift federal action in any recession
and promised fiscal policies that will
i stimulate business. He also pro
. posed extension of unemployment
• and social security benefits to mil
lions of additional persons.
Mr. Eisenhower also called for a
constitutional amendment to lower
the voting age from 21 to 18.
Republican Congressional lead
ers generally hailed the message
as "statesmanlike" and said it laid
down a "sound and forward-look
ing program." House Speaker Jo
seph W. Martin, Jr. (Mass.), pre
dicted Congress would approve "a
substantial part" of it.
Democratic leaders were more
reserved. Senate Democratic Lead
er Lyndon B. Johnson (Tex.) said
the tone of the message was that of
, "moderation and reason." House

Democratic Leader Sam Rayburn
(Tex.) noted it contained few spe
cific legislative recommendations
and said "we will still have to wait
to see what the program is."
But storm clouds were raised
among both Republicans and Dem
ocrats when Mr. Eisenhower pro
posed flexible farm price supports
and when he broached his tax pro
gram. Martin acknowledged that
Mr. Eisenhower would meet his
"greatest difficulty" from Congress
men who want another general tax
cut before the November elections.
The President told Congress
that tax cuts ''can and will he
made" once the budget is bal
anced. In addition, he strongly
endorsed a proposed revised tax
system to rccove "the more glar
ing tax inequities, particularly on
small taxpayers."
But he strongly urged postpone
ment of scheduled tax cuts on cor
porations, gasoline, liquor, tobacco,
and automobiles. Some influential
members of Congress want at least
some of these excise taxes reduced
on schedule April 1.

the tone of the message was that of

Democratic Leader Sam Rayburn
(Tex.) noted it contained few spe
cific legislative recommendations
and said "we will still have to wait

But storm clouds were raised
among both Republicans and Dem

posed flexible farm price supports
and when he broached his tax pro

Mr. Eisenhower would meet his
"greatest difficulty" from Congress
men who want another general tax
cut before the November elections.
The President told Congress
that tax cuts ''can and will he
made" once the budget is bal
anced. In addition, he strongly
endorsed a proposed revised tax
system to rccove "the more glar

small taxpayers."
But he strongly urged postpone
ment of scheduled tax cuts on cor

members of Congress want at least
some of these excise taxes reduced
on schedule April 1.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 (UP)—President Eisenhower asked Congress yesterday in his annual
State of the Union message to cut government spending but to forego any general tax cuts this
year.
He also declared to a jam-packed joint session oh the House and Senate that the United States
stands ready to use its "great and growing" stockpile of atomic weapons if necessary to "pre
serve our freedom."
Mr. Eisenhower, speaking slowly and deliberately, appealed to the election-year Congress for
bipartisan support for his scaled-down military program on grounds that new atomic and hydro-

♦gen weapons "permit economies in
I the use of men."
He outlined in his 7,000-word
televised and broadcast address
an atomic-age program for 1954
which he said would make Aim r
j ica stronger and safer against
both Communism and depression
— and with less government
spending.
The President asked that convict
ed Communists be denied citizen
ship and proposed a gradual adop
tion of flexible farm price supports.
To keep the nation strong eco
nomically, Mr. Eisenhower pledged
swift federal action in any recession
and promised fiscal policies that will
i stimulate business. He also pro
. posed extension of unemployment
• and social security benefits to mil
lions of additional persons.
Mr. Eisenhower also called for a
constitutional amendment to lower
the voting age from 21 to 18.
Republican Congressional lead
ers generally hailed the message
as "statesmanlike" and said it laid
down a "sound and forward-look
ing program." House Speaker Jo
seph W. Martin, Jr. (Mass.), pre
dicted Congress would approve "a
substantial part" of it.
