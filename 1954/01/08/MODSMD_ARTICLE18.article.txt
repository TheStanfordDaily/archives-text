WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 (UP)—
President Eisenhower's personal
appearance before Congress to
day was a thumping box office
triumph—but the Soviet ambas
sador sat on his hands.
Not once did lie join in the 50
bursts of applause that punctu
ated Mr. Eisenhower's 52-niinute
address to a glittering televised
joint session of the House and
Senate.
And for the first time in the
memory of Capitol veterans, some
of the diplomatic corps had to
stand. But not Russian Ambas
sador George N. Zarubin. He was
there early enough to get a seat.
Zarubin joined the lawmakers
and spectators in rising when Mr.
Eisenhower mounted the rostrum
promptly at 12:.'5 ft p.m. EST. Hut
he did not join in their two-min
ute ovation.
