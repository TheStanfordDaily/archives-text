Increasing the pace of its rushing
| activities as the weekend approach
es, Stanford's eating clubs held
j their second combined open house
j last night at the club building and
pushed plans for weekend rushing
I parties.
Interclub Council president Buzz
: Feinberg termed himself "quite
happy" over the freshman turnout
j so far. The "excellent" club infor
mation manual is largely respon
j sible for the good showing, Feinberg
said.
"The clubs have worked to
gelher very well in organizing
these open houses and in deter
mining the clubs' rushing policy,"
Feinberg said.
This year the eating clubs deter
mined rushing policy independently
of the fraternities. When Interfra
ternity Council decided to abandon
vacation rushing and divide the
| lreshman class alphabetically for
open houses, the clubs deviated
from IFC policy for the first time
since the clubs were founded at
Stanford.
The clubs also permit unlimited
social contact throughout the rush
ing period this year; the fraternities
have forbidden their men to enter
freshman residences until Sunday.
Attendance at last night's open
house was down slightly from
Tuesday's, because the fraternity
open houses were going on at the
same time. Rushing parties and
pledging activities are being car
ried on at the discretion of indi
vidual clubs.
The clubs will hold their third
and last open house next Tuesday
evening from 8 to 10 in the club
building north of Toyon Hall. All
clubs will be open to all freshmen.
The seven Stanford eating clubs
are Los Arcos, Breakers, El Campo.
El Capitan, El Cuadro, El Tigre, and
El Toro.
