cently bleated that the buildinglcss roof on Palm

Corn wall is became an expert
on rushing procedure during his
three years at the lota Psi house;
he specialized in Open Houses.
Wl. i at the end of these three
years he went minus twenty
five and thus became an alumnus,
he left a set of rules for open
house procedure which is still

kept among lota Psi's secret papers. By the kind
acquiescence of a sophomore in the house (who,
having been slipped a sum in Poll Parrot money,
looked the other way) we have obtained and now
present certain excerpts from these classic rules.
1. Early in the quarter, gamble a stamp and learn'
the secrets of Dynamic Tension—better yet, How
to Mould a Mighty Grip—or work out at the gym
until sufficient stamina is built to withstand all sorts
of handshaking, backslapping, and smiling.
2. Acquire a smile. The classic suggestion is to
relax the corners of the mouth and exhale. Another
method is to attempt to touch the chin with the upper
teeth.
3. Develop your memory. Start by trying to re
member the names of your professors. Then start
associating the Brothers' names with their faces.
BE SURE to know the house president's name.
4. Within the house, set up a panel of experts on

various subjects. When a youth opens a conversation
by saying, "I find untold fascination in the Eocene
faunas of the Purisiroa Formation as exposed at the
outlet of Ann Nuevo Creek," send for the House
Paleontologist. We will explain what to do until
the Paleontologist arrives in another volume.
5. Stay on your toes. Once Cornwallis was assigned
to glad-handle an oaf named Bezldrumpiviteh, who
had held down the entire left side of the Stanford
frosh line against Cal and was thus a Hot Prospect.
The conversation drifted to personalities. "I hear,"
said Bezldrumpiviteh, "dat probably de biggest shmoe
on dis campus is a punk name of Morton Crummer,
what is out of it but complete." Just then the lota
Psi house president, Morton Crummer, happened up.
"Bezldrumpiviteh," said Cornwallis, "I would like
for you to meet a Brother. Alex Bezldrumpiviteh;
Hosmir Gootch!"
Albeit Cornwallis had to answer the house tele
phone for three weeks, the day was saved. Morton
Crummer subsequently changed his name to Hosmir
Gootch and Bezldrumpiviteh went lota Psi.
The last rule which we will include here we shall
quote in Cornwallis' own words:
"Men, there is no question but what we could get
all the freshmen wo wanted if we could think up
something new to say at open house. You might give
it a thought sometime; we know that every fresh
man takes Civ, comes from Los Angeles, thinks the
weather has been awful, and wishes the meals were
better in the freshman dorms. So why ask them?
When we think up some new questions, our future
will be assured!"
Between us, Cornwallis, when we think up some
new questions, the future will be past.
