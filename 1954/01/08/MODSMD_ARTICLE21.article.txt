## 
### 
(Editor's note: Following is a
United Press summary of the high
points in President Eisenhower's
Report to the Nation, delivered be
fore a joint meeting of both houses
of the Congress yesterday morn
ing)
FOREIGN AFFAIRS American
freedom is threatened as long as the
world Communist conspiracy exists
in its present scope, power, and hos
tility . . . the U.S. is prepared to
meet any renewal of aggression in
Korea and a mutual security pact
with the Republic of Korea will be
■ ent to the Senate for ratification
soon . . military and economic aid
will bo continued to Nationalist
China . . . the Middle East will have i
sympathetic and impartial friend- i
ship . . .
Western European policy rests
firmly on the Atlantic Treaty . . .
.the US. will continue to develop
harmonious and mutually beneficial
co-operation with Western Hemi
spheric nations . . . the United Na
tions still is in a state of evolution, 1
but is a place where the guilt can
be squarely assigned to those who
fail to take the necessary steps to ;
keep peace, and deserves U.S. con- j
tinued firm support.
FOREIGN ASSISTANCE AND
TRADE — The free world can no
longer afford the arbitrary re
traints on trade that have contin
ued since World War If . . . mili
tary assistance must be continued
and technical assistance maintained,
but economic as istance can be re
duced, although economic programs
in Korea and a few other critical
places remain important . . .
The forthcoming budget message
will propose continuing Presiden
tial power of transferability of all
assistance funds, will ask authority
to merge them with regular defense
funds, and put primary authority
for foreign military assistance un
der the Defense Secretary.
ATOMIC ENERGY - By main
taining military strength and draw
ing closer the bonds wiLh our allies,
the U.S. is in a position to discuss
outstanding issues with the Soviet
Union . . .
A truly constructive Soviet reac
tion to U S. atomic proposals pre
sented to the U.N. will make pos
ible a new start toward an era of
peace and away from the fatal road
toward atomic war.
DEFENSE U.S. military power
continues 1o grow, but is only to
deter aggression and provide a mas
sive capability to strike back in
event of attack . . . U.S. defense will
be stronger if knowledge cW' certain
nuclear weapons is shared with al
lies . . these new weapons permit
economies in manpower ... as will
be seen in the budget message. Air
power of the Navy and Air Force is
receiving heavy emphasis . . .
Pay alone will not retain in the
armed forces a sufficient number of
trained career personnel so more
iftent'in should be given to other
benefits such as adequate living
quarters, family housing units, and
medical care for dependents . . .
Con-res. v ill he urged to approve
US. participation in construction of
the St. Lawrence seaway . . .
INTERNAL SECURITY - More
than 2.200 federal employees have
been dismissed a~ security risks . . .
security demands that investiga

tions of new employees and deroga- i
tory information against present
employees be concluded as soon as
possible . . .
There should be a law dealing
with the Communist party in the
U.S and its subversive character
. ... any American convicted of hav
ing advocated overthrow of the
government by violence should be
treated as having renounced his al
legiance'and forfeited his citizen
ship . . . the Attorney General soon
will recommend additional legal
weapons with which to combat sub
version and to deal with the ques
tion of claimed immunity.
STRONG ECONOMY — Economic I
j preparedness is fully as important
1 as military preparedness and will
j not be left to chance . . . the nation
can remain strong economically in
the transition from a wartime econ
omy to a peacetime economy . .
* Subsequent special message and
the Jan. 28 economic report will set
forth plans and recommendations to
1 Congress including flexible credit
| and debt management policies; tax
measures to stimulate consumer ;fnd
| business spending; suitable lending,
guaranteeing, insuring, and grant
, in-aid activities; strengthened old
j age and unemployment insurance
| measures; improved agricultural
j programs; public works plans laid ]
j well in advance; enlarged oppor- (
| (.unities for international trade and J
J agreement.
BUDGET Because the govern- I
merit's bills must be paid every I
month while lax revenues come in |
at various times, it will be necessary I
to renew the request to increase the I
' national debt limit ...
The administration and Congress
ieduced spending levels by $7,000,- j
j WO.OOO in the current year and will |
I cut it another $5,000,000,000 next
year . . . despite present reduced j
taxes and further reductions to be I
: proposed, reduced spending will
! bring the new budget closer to a I
balance.
TAXES — The whole tax system
must be thoroughly revised . . . the j
more glaring tax inequities should J
be removed, particularly on small
taxpayers, and restraints on the .
growth of small business reduced j
. . 25 recommendations on these ■
problems will be in the budget mes
sage . . .
The administration proposes lib
! eral tax treatment for dependent
children who work, for widows or '
widowers with dependent children,
and for medical purposes . . . the I
corporation income tax should be j
j kept at 52 per cent for another year
. . . excise taxes scheduled to be
reduced April 1, should be contin- i
ued at present rates . . . the 1951 j
renegotiation act should be extend- |
ed to eliminate excessive profits, and
waste of public funds
AGRICULTURE - Continually j
growing surpluses leave two alter
natives: greater acreage reductions
and more federal control which is ;
; contrary to fundamental interests. I
j or permit the market price of agri- I
I cultural products gradually to have
: a greater influence on planning pro- !
duction, which is the sound pol
i ic -x, - •
I Transition to modernized parity
must be accomplished gradually
i with no abrupt downward change
in the dollar level or price support

percentage level . . . existing sur
pluses must be channeled to special
uses such as school lunches, disas
ter relief, foreign emergency assist
ance, and stockpiling . . .
CONSERVATION — All federal
conservation and resource develop
ment projects are being reappraised
. . . new projects must be economi
cally sound, with local cost sharing
wherever possible .. 23 such proj
ects will be started next year.
NATIONAL HIGHWAYS — To
overcome present inadequacies in
the interstate highway system, the
federal gasoline tax of two cents a
gallon, which would have been de
creased by one,-half cent April 1,
must be continued.
POST OFFlCE—Substantial sav
ings already made and to be made
cannot eliminate the postal deficit
. . . legislation will be necessary
to adjust certain postal rates . . .
Congress will be asked to establish
a permanent commission to estab
lish fair and reasonable postal rates
in the future.
LABOR AND WELFARE — The
Taft-Hartley Act is basically sound,
but can be improved by recommen
dations which will be sent to Con
gress on Monday . . . unemploy
ment insurance should be extended
to some 6,500,000 workers including
civilian federal employees . .
Congress should act on previous
recommendations to add 10,000,000
more workers to the old-age and
survivors insurance program ... a
new formula will be proposed mak
ing it possible to reduce federal
grants-in-aid for this purpose . . .
the program for rehabilitation of
disabled persons should be strength
ened.
HEALTH—The administration is
flatly opposed to socialized medicine
and feels hospital and medical serv
ices can best be handled by private
plans . . . the government should
encourage medical research in dread
diseases such as cancer and heart
ailments, help states in their health
programs, and broaden "other facili
ties.
EDUCATION—The nation is not
providing enough teachers or
schools . . control and direction
of education policy is a state and
local responsibility, but the federal
government should stand ready to
help states which cannot provide
school buildings.
HOUSING — A special message
yvill be sent to Congress Jan. 25 in
cluding mortgage insurance, loans
And grants-in-aid, slum clearance,
lending and credit, insurance of
long-term loans and continuance of
the 1940 public housing program
j act.
VETERANS ADMINISTRATION
When internal reorganization is
completed it will provide better
ervicel for the 20.0<)0,000 American
war veterans.
SUFFRAGE — Residents of the
Disti ict of Columbia should hive
I the right to vote and local self-gov
| eminent . . . Hawaii should be ad
! mitted to statehood . . . the admin
| istration hopes the states will co
operate with Congress in adopling
uniform voting laws for member; of
j the armed forces overseas . . Con
gress is urged to propose a cot iti
(ution.il amendment to the sf itcs
etting the voting age at 18 years

ieduced spending levels by $7,000,- j
j WO.OOO in the current year and will |
I cut it another $5,000,000,000 next

taxes and further reductions to be I
: proposed, reduced spending will

ued at present rates . . . the 1951 j

growing surpluses leave two alter
natives: greater acreage reductions
and more federal control which is ;
; contrary to fundamental interests. I
j or permit the market price of agri- I
I cultural products gradually to have
: a greater influence on planning pro- !
duction, which is the sound pol
i ic -x, - •
I Transition to modernized parity
must be accomplished gradually
i with no abrupt downward change
in the dollar level or price support

percentage level . . . existing sur
pluses must be channeled to special
uses such as school lunches, disas
ter relief, foreign emergency assist
ance, and stockpiling . . .

but can be improved by recommen
dations which will be sent to Con
gress on Monday . . . unemploy
ment insurance should be extended
to some 6,500,000 workers including

survivors insurance program ... a
new formula will be proposed mak
ing it possible to reduce federal
grants-in-aid for this purpose . . .
the program for rehabilitation of
disabled persons should be strength
ened.
HEALTH—The administration is
flatly opposed to socialized medicine

ices can best be handled by private
plans . . . the government should
encourage medical research in dread
diseases such as cancer and heart
ailments, help states in their health
programs, and broaden "other facili
ties.
EDUCATION—The nation is not
providing enough teachers or
schools . . control and direction
of education policy is a state and

VETERANS ADMINISTRATION
When internal reorganization is
completed it will provide better
ervicel for the 20.0<)0,000 American
war veterans.
SUFFRAGE — Residents of the
Disti ict of Columbia should hive
I the right to vote and local self-gov
| eminent . . . Hawaii should be ad
! mitted to statehood . . . the admin
| istration hopes the states will co
operate with Congress in adopling
uniform voting laws for member; of

gress is urged to propose a cot iti
(ution.il amendment to the sf itcs
etting the voting age at 18 years
(Editor's note: Following is a
United Press summary of the high
points in President Eisenhower's
Report to the Nation, delivered be
fore a joint meeting of both houses
of the Congress yesterday morn
ing)
FOREIGN AFFAIRS American
freedom is threatened as long as the
world Communist conspiracy exists
in its present scope, power, and hos
tility . . . the U.S. is prepared to
meet any renewal of aggression in
Korea and a mutual security pact
with the Republic of Korea will be
■ ent to the Senate for ratification
soon . . military and economic aid
will bo continued to Nationalist
China . . . the Middle East will have i
sympathetic and impartial friend- i
ship . . .
Western European policy rests
firmly on the Atlantic Treaty . . .
.the US. will continue to develop
harmonious and mutually beneficial
co-operation with Western Hemi
spheric nations . . . the United Na
tions still is in a state of evolution, 1
but is a place where the guilt can
be squarely assigned to those who
fail to take the necessary steps to ;
keep peace, and deserves U.S. con- j
tinued firm support.
FOREIGN ASSISTANCE AND
TRADE — The free world can no
longer afford the arbitrary re
traints on trade that have contin
ued since World War If . . . mili
tary assistance must be continued
and technical assistance maintained,
but economic as istance can be re
duced, although economic programs
in Korea and a few other critical
places remain important . . .
The forthcoming budget message
will propose continuing Presiden
tial power of transferability of all
assistance funds, will ask authority
to merge them with regular defense
funds, and put primary authority
for foreign military assistance un
der the Defense Secretary.
ATOMIC ENERGY - By main
taining military strength and draw
ing closer the bonds wiLh our allies,
the U.S. is in a position to discuss
outstanding issues with the Soviet
Union . . .
A truly constructive Soviet reac
tion to U S. atomic proposals pre
sented to the U.N. will make pos
ible a new start toward an era of
peace and away from the fatal road
toward atomic war.
DEFENSE U.S. military power
continues 1o grow, but is only to
deter aggression and provide a mas
sive capability to strike back in
event of attack . . . U.S. defense will
be stronger if knowledge cW' certain
nuclear weapons is shared with al
lies . . these new weapons permit
economies in manpower ... as will
be seen in the budget message. Air
power of the Navy and Air Force is
receiving heavy emphasis . . .
Pay alone will not retain in the
armed forces a sufficient number of
trained career personnel so more
iftent'in should be given to other
benefits such as adequate living
quarters, family housing units, and
medical care for dependents . . .
Con-res. v ill he urged to approve
US. participation in construction of
the St. Lawrence seaway . . .
INTERNAL SECURITY - More
than 2.200 federal employees have
been dismissed a~ security risks . . .
security demands that investiga

tions of new employees and deroga- i
tory information against present
employees be concluded as soon as
possible . . .
There should be a law dealing
with the Communist party in the
U.S and its subversive character
. ... any American convicted of hav
ing advocated overthrow of the
government by violence should be
treated as having renounced his al
legiance'and forfeited his citizen
ship . . . the Attorney General soon
will recommend additional legal
weapons with which to combat sub
version and to deal with the ques
tion of claimed immunity.

freedom is threatened as long as the
world Communist conspiracy exists
in its present scope, power, and hos
tility . . . the U.S. is prepared to
meet any renewal of aggression in
Korea and a mutual security pact
with the Republic of Korea will be

but is a place where the guilt can
be squarely assigned to those who
fail to take the necessary steps to ;

tinued firm support.
FOREIGN ASSISTANCE AND
TRADE — The free world can no
longer afford the arbitrary re
traints on trade that have contin
ued since World War If . . . mili
tary assistance must be continued
and technical assistance maintained,
but economic as istance can be re
duced, although economic programs
in Korea and a few other critical
places remain important . . .
The forthcoming budget message
will propose continuing Presiden
tial power of transferability of all
assistance funds, will ask authority
to merge them with regular defense
funds, and put primary authority
for foreign military assistance un
der the Defense Secretary.
ATOMIC ENERGY - By main

lies . . these new weapons permit
economies in manpower ... as will
be seen in the budget message. Air
power of the Navy and Air Force is
receiving heavy emphasis . . .

j preparedness is fully as important

j WO.OOO in the current year and will |

corporation income tax should be j
j kept at 52 per cent for another year

reduced April 1, should be contin- i
ued at present rates . . . the 1951 j
renegotiation act should be extend- |
ed to eliminate excessive profits, and
waste of public funds

growing surpluses leave two alter
natives: greater acreage reductions
and more federal control which is ;

duction, which is the sound pol
i ic -x, - •
I Transition to modernized parity
must be accomplished gradually

ance, and stockpiling . . .

Taft-Hartley Act is basically sound,
but can be improved by recommen
dations which will be sent to Con
gress on Monday . . . unemploy

civilian federal employees . .
Congress should act on previous

j WO.OOO in the current year and will |
I cut it another $5,000,000,000 next

taxes and further reductions to be I
: proposed, reduced spending will

j kept at 52 per cent for another year
. . . excise taxes scheduled to be
reduced April 1, should be contin- i
ued at present rates . . . the 1951 j
renegotiation act should be extend- |
ed to eliminate excessive profits, and

growing surpluses leave two alter
natives: greater acreage reductions

; contrary to fundamental interests. I
j or permit the market price of agri- I
I cultural products gradually to have
: a greater influence on planning pro- !

Taft-Hartley Act is basically sound,
but can be improved by recommen
dations which will be sent to Con
gress on Monday . . . unemploy
ment insurance should be extended
to some 6,500,000 workers including
civilian federal employees . .
Congress should act on previous

ing it possible to reduce federal
grants-in-aid for this purpose . . .

disabled persons should be strength
ened.

ices can best be handled by private
plans . . . the government should
encourage medical research in dread
diseases such as cancer and heart
ailments, help states in their health
programs, and broaden "other facili
ties.
EDUCATION—The nation is not
providing enough teachers or
schools . . control and direction
of education policy is a state and
