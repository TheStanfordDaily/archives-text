# RUSS WILKS
## The 						Inside Pitch 
### 
Stanford cage coach Bob Burnett said Monday at the regular meeting
of the basketball sportscasters and writers that, 'We have the best I
bench that Stanford has had since the days of Hank Luisetti."
And as injuries are mounting up he's getting a chance to prove that
statement. When Ron Tomsic suffered an injury to his lateral cartilage
in the COP game Barry Brown was pulled out of the ranks of 'the in
experienced and garnered 10 points against Oregon and helped Russ
Lawler pick off the rebounds.
So now Olie Suzdaleff, co-captain and Northern California's "player
of the week," injures his knee and won t play against USC in two big
ones in Los Angeles tonight and tomorrow.
Ron Wagner, who proved himself against lreshman competition last
season and has looked like a real comer this year, will take over for
Suzdaleff. With the addition of Wagner, Burnett will have three sopho
mores in the starting line-up including George Selleck and Brown. If
experience is the best teacher, we shotdd be in for several good basketball
seasons.
The Cards are one of the few undefeated cage squads in the nation
and can attribute their victories to all around hustle and effective
hall hawking, not to mention the reserve strength in Carlos Bea, Bill |
Flanders, Bill Turner, and Dave Epperson.
Burnett, lacking the height, has been forced to employ a half court
press and his strategy is paying big dividends. Although Stanford hasn't
met the toughest opposition it has proven that it has a sound ball club
by its ability to come from behind. 1
Riding the crest of a nine game winning streak the quintet will get
its fifst major test against USC. If the Indians sweep this series there
could be a repeat of the football season in which all the "experts" said
the gridders would go nowhere.
The cagers at Westwood and Figueroa havfe been poking a lot of fun
at Stanford's near height-less-wonders asking, "How is Russ Lawler and
his flea circus?"
Well, he who laughs last. . . .

Diamond star Ray Swarts has given up his remaining season of eligi
bility and has signed with the Hollywood Stars far a reported $4,000 bonus.
Swarts was one of the Indians' leading hitters last year and will be
sorely missed as Coach Everett Dean was going to move him from third
into centerfield in order to bolster the gap left by the graduation of Dick
Cole.
* # *
Unless he is the bonus pick. Bob Garrett will be selected by the Chicago
Cardinals in the pro football draft later this month. The Cards had
the poorest season of any club (a win and a tic in twelve games) and
therefore will get the first selection. They want the pass master.

After a two-month workout last semester under the tutelage of Dean,
Billy Alhouse, and Jack Shepard, thirty players were selected to make up
the Varsity and Braves baseball squads.
Eight holdovers return to defend the PCC crown including pitchers
Ken Brown, Mike Acker, Phil Page, and Don DeLong; infielders A 1
Talboy, Warren Goodrich, Tom Dandurand, and Rich Scramaglia.
Twelve Braves will attempt to win starting berths including pitchers
Dave Freeman, Gil Duncan, and Lon McKellar; catchers Len Swartz and
Clarke Nelson; infielders Sid Hall and Frank Tenerello; and outfielders
Dixie Workman, Terry Evans, Gordon Galloway, Ralph Cassadv, and
Gary Larsen.
Nine from last year's frosh squad were named including pitchers
Bob Gray, A 1 Dunn, Ray Young, and Jack Heffelfinger; catcher Ron
Witort; and infielders Mickey Holzman, Bob Fisher, Rocky Furst, and
Neil Papiano.
Tony Serra will be a first quarter sophomore this spring and is a strong
contender for the first base job.

Maybe the reason Michigan State was able to come back strong in the
second half of the Rose Bowl was because they weren't as physically
beaten as UCLA. I offer this theory because the Spartans used a new type
of padding this season which has outstanding shock absorbing properties.
For the scientific interests, the padding is made of cellular plastic called
Ensolite which is honeycombed with millions of tiny, non-connecting air
cells. It was used in knee pads, thigh guards, hip pads, rib pads, and
shoulder guards. It was also used inside football helmets to protect the
wearer and on the outside surface of the helmets to protect the oppo- I
sition, it says here.
Notre Dame, Michigan, Cincinnati, Xavier, and Cornell were several j
other schools that used this equipment.
This new material, which is proving so successful, was manufactured i
after boxing ring mats made of the substance were adopted by the New
York Boxing Commission.
It is interesting to note that the new plastic material is a first cousin |
of the sponge-like rubber op which fresh eggs were dropped 100 feet !
without breaking in New York City in 1947.

cells. It was used in knee pads, thigh guards, hip pads, rib pads, and
shoulder guards. It was also used inside football helmets to protect the
wearer and on the outside surface of the helmets to protect the oppo- I
sition, it says here.
Notre Dame, Michigan, Cincinnati, Xavier, and Cornell were several j
other schools that used this equipment.
This new material, which is proving so successful, was manufactured i
after boxing ring mats made of the substance were adopted by the New
York Boxing Commission.
It is interesting to note that the new plastic material is a first cousin |
of the sponge-like rubber op which fresh eggs were dropped 100 feet !
without breaking in New York City in 1947.
Stanford cage coach Bob Burnett said Monday at the regular meeting
of the basketball sportscasters and writers that, 'We have the best I
bench that Stanford has had since the days of Hank Luisetti."
And as injuries are mounting up he's getting a chance to prove that
statement. When Ron Tomsic suffered an injury to his lateral cartilage
in the COP game Barry Brown was pulled out of the ranks of 'the in
experienced and garnered 10 points against Oregon and helped Russ
Lawler pick off the rebounds.
So now Olie Suzdaleff, co-captain and Northern California's "player
of the week," injures his knee and won t play against USC in two big
ones in Los Angeles tonight and tomorrow.
Ron Wagner, who proved himself against lreshman competition last
season and has looked like a real comer this year, will take over for
Suzdaleff. With the addition of Wagner, Burnett will have three sopho
mores in the starting line-up including George Selleck and Brown. If
experience is the best teacher, we shotdd be in for several good basketball
seasons.
The Cards are one of the few undefeated cage squads in the nation
and can attribute their victories to all around hustle and effective
hall hawking, not to mention the reserve strength in Carlos Bea, Bill |
Flanders, Bill Turner, and Dave Epperson.
Burnett, lacking the height, has been forced to employ a half court
press and his strategy is paying big dividends. Although Stanford hasn't
met the toughest opposition it has proven that it has a sound ball club
by its ability to come from behind. 1
Riding the crest of a nine game winning streak the quintet will get
its fifst major test against USC. If the Indians sweep this series there
could be a repeat of the football season in which all the "experts" said
the gridders would go nowhere.
The cagers at Westwood and Figueroa havfe been poking a lot of fun
at Stanford's near height-less-wonders asking, "How is Russ Lawler and
his flea circus?"
Well, he who laughs last. . . .

Diamond star Ray Swarts has given up his remaining season of eligi
bility and has signed with the Hollywood Stars far a reported $4,000 bonus.
Swarts was one of the Indians' leading hitters last year and will be
sorely missed as Coach Everett Dean was going to move him from third
into centerfield in order to bolster the gap left by the graduation of Dick
Cole.
* # *
Unless he is the bonus pick. Bob Garrett will be selected by the Chicago
Cardinals in the pro football draft later this month. The Cards had
the poorest season of any club (a win and a tic in twelve games) and
therefore will get the first selection. They want the pass master.

After a two-month workout last semester under the tutelage of Dean,
Billy Alhouse, and Jack Shepard, thirty players were selected to make up
the Varsity and Braves baseball squads.
Eight holdovers return to defend the PCC crown including pitchers
Ken Brown, Mike Acker, Phil Page, and Don DeLong; infielders A 1
Talboy, Warren Goodrich, Tom Dandurand, and Rich Scramaglia.
Twelve Braves will attempt to win starting berths including pitchers
Dave Freeman, Gil Duncan, and Lon McKellar; catchers Len Swartz and
Clarke Nelson; infielders Sid Hall and Frank Tenerello; and outfielders
Dixie Workman, Terry Evans, Gordon Galloway, Ralph Cassadv, and
Gary Larsen.
Nine from last year's frosh squad were named including pitchers
Bob Gray, A 1 Dunn, Ray Young, and Jack Heffelfinger; catcher Ron
Witort; and infielders Mickey Holzman, Bob Fisher, Rocky Furst, and
Neil Papiano.
Tony Serra will be a first quarter sophomore this spring and is a strong
contender for the first base job.

Maybe the reason Michigan State was able to come back strong in the
second half of the Rose Bowl was because they weren't as physically
beaten as UCLA. I offer this theory because the Spartans used a new type
of padding this season which has outstanding shock absorbing properties.

Nine from last year's frosh squad were named including pitchers
Bob Gray, A 1 Dunn, Ray Young, and Jack Heffelfinger; catcher Ron
Witort; and infielders Mickey Holzman, Bob Fisher, Rocky Furst, and
Neil Papiano.
Tony Serra will be a first quarter sophomore this spring and is a strong
contender for the first base job.

Maybe the reason Michigan State was able to come back strong in the
second half of the Rose Bowl was because they weren't as physically
beaten as UCLA. I offer this theory because the Spartans used a new type
of padding this season which has outstanding shock absorbing properties.
For the scientific interests, the padding is made of cellular plastic called
Ensolite which is honeycombed with millions of tiny, non-connecting air
cells. It was used in knee pads, thigh guards, hip pads, rib pads, and
shoulder guards. It was also used inside football helmets to protect the
wearer and on the outside surface of the helmets to protect the oppo- I
sition, it says here.
Notre Dame, Michigan, Cincinnati, Xavier, and Cornell were several j
other schools that used this equipment.
This new material, which is proving so successful, was manufactured i
after boxing ring mats made of the substance were adopted by the New
York Boxing Commission.
It is interesting to note that the new plastic material is a first cousin |
of the sponge-like rubber op which fresh eggs were dropped 100 feet !
without breaking in New York City in 1947.
