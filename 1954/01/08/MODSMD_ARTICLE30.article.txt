Stanford stars Jim Ramstead, A 1
Talboy, and Jim Westphal, figure to
give the Braves a stiff battle.

starting lineup for the games as
Gunnar Christiansen and John
Hendricks at forwards, Bob Mc-
Grath at center, and Ben Heirs and
Bob Milton at guards.

squad in scoring along with Mc-
Grath, a 6-3 pivotman, in the five
contests the Braves have played
thus far, three of them during vaca
tion when the team was 1101 at full
strength. Christiansen has shown
up well on the boards, and Milton
and Heirs have excelled at setting
up the plays.
