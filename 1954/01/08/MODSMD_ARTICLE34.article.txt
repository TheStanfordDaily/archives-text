# Planning Office: 9 Guiding Years
## Six Premises Rule Farm Program 
### RUTH JAHNKE 
It is costly to plan, but it is
more costly not to, was the opin
ion expressed by Dr. Donald B.
Tresidder when he started the
Stanford University Planning
Office in 1945 under the direc
tion of Eldridge T. Spencer.
The immediate problem which
made this organization necessary was
the deluge of returning veterans and
the resulting need for additional
classroom and dormitory space.
Two other problems needed con
sideration at this time. First, the
University needed a philosophy to
guide it in planning its physical
structure. Second, the University
needed an overall plan for campus
land assignments and circulation of
traffic.
In organizing the Planning Office,
Director of Planning Spencer felt
that Stanford needed not the con
ventional graphic master plan, but
a more plastic, all - encompassing
theory which would guide and di- •
rect the design and construction of
campus buildings for decades.
In 1947 six premises were formu
lated which serve as the basis for
and controlling factor in campus ex
pansion:
1. Physical environment is recog
nized as a major influence on the
life of man and on his institutions.
(This premise reflects the influence
of modern architectural design and
theory seldom found in educational
institutions.)
2. The Inner Quad will continue
to be the heart of the University.
3. Architectural unity will be
achieved by form, not by recre
ating former styles. The original
architectural plan of relating
buildings to courts, illustrated in
Inner Quad and later in the
courts between Inner and Outer
Quad, has remained the funda
mental architectural relationship.
The Science Quad, Tresidder
Union, and dormitories for men and
women, all planned for construction
in the near future, will fit in
smoothly regardless of whether
they have red tile roofs and sand
stone columns with decorated capi
tals.

4. The basis of the University's
circulation will he a system ol' con
centric roads. Campus traffic was
originally directed around Outer
Quad, but as the campus has ex
panded outward, the cars have had
to make larger and larger circles in
crossing campus.
The present plan calls for a road
that will curve behind the future
site of the Stanford Medical School,
up and around behind the projected
Tresidder Union and now men's
dormitory site, and back down in a
wide curve to Pine Avenue and
Palm Drive. Except for parking lots,
there will be no regular traffic dur
ing academic hours within this
largest of a series of concentric cir
cles.
5. Th» basic relationship of the
land to (lie functions of the Uni-

versity will be preserved. As in
the beginning, an architectural
style is not chosen and then im
posed (in the surrounding campus,
but the land is studied and envi
ronmental design is utilized to
blend with i'.e topography.
6. The University will provide
adequate housing .facilities for the
majority of its students and staff.
The additions to Crothers, the men's
dorm across from Branner, the
women's dorm just below the Knoll
—all these will be under construc
tion as soon as they can bo financed.
As Stanford wa.i unique in being
a planned university in its incep
tion, so now it is unique in having
set up a planning organization on a
permanent basis. The founding of
the Planning Office in 1945 and the
formulation of these six premises in

1947 mark the entrance of a univer
sity into the field of the modern
concept of planning and architec
ture.
