PANMUNJOM. Korea, Friday,
Jan. 8 (UP)â€”lndian Lt. Gen. G. S.
Thimayya today was reported ready
to accept a United Nations demand
that 22,200 anti - Communist war
prisoners be released from their
neutral zone compounds Jan. 23.
The Communist high command
revealed contents of a note Thi
mayya sent to the Reds and Allies
in which he said it was "manda
tory" the POW's be released unless
both sides agreed otherwise.
It was clear the Communist and
U.N. leaders could not reach agree
ment on disposition of the prisoners.
North Korean Premier Kim II
Sung and Chinese Gen. Peng Teh
huai sent Thimayya an uncompro
mising 2.300-word letter last night
demanding that the North Korean
and Chinese POW's be held cap- ;
tive beyond Jan. 23 .
Barely 24 hours earlier the U.N. |
repeated its demand that the pris- j
oners be freed on schedule as speci- |
fied by the Korean armistice agree- !
ment.
The Reds, in their new ultima
tum. demanded 80 more days for
"come home" explanations and |
asked for an additional 30 days for
| a Korean peace conference to decide j
the POWs' fate.
