## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 (UP)—President Eisenhower will send
to Congress tomorrow farm and labor messages which are ex
pected to touch ojf heated House Senate debate and prove a po
tent factor in the November congressional elections.
Th farm message will spell out for the first time the administra-

tion's farm program which the
President has said is geared to the
"gradual" adoption of flexible price
supports and the movement of food
"into, consumption instead of into
storage."
Mr. Eisenhower's labor message
will contain his recommendation's
for amending the six-year-old Taft-
Hartley law. It is understood to be
a middle - of - the - road program
which will not meet with the full
approval of either management, or
labor.
Chairman Homer Ferguson (R.,
Mich.) of the Senate Republican
Policy Committee said the Presi
dent's proposals will be "fair" and
will "please the working people, but
not some of the (labor) leaders"
who are "dedicated" to repeal of
Taft-Hartley.
Farm state Congressmen, how
ever, will light to the last against
any attempt to move away from
the present program of high rigid
price supports. Senate Demo
cratic Leader Lyndon B. Johnson
summed up this attitude when he
told his Texas constituents in a
broadcast:
"I am not going to vote for any
farm law that would give Texas
farmers less protection than they
arc getting now."
Mr. Eisenhower said in his State
of the Union message that during
the change-over to a flexible price
support system crops now plagued
; by surpluses must be "insulated
from the normal channels of trade
| for special uses."
The President's program will be
the subject of extensive hearings by
the House and Senate Agriculture
Committees.
Members of the House Agricul
ture Committee will leave tomor
row to sample "grass roots" senti
ment in the Southwest and Mid
! South on the farm program.
