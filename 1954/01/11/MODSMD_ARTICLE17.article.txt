# Cards, USC Split Weekend Series
## 
### IRWIN JOHNSON 
In two thrilling games Stanford's basketball team managed to
tip USC 61 to 59 Friday night, but fell from the ranks of the nation's
undefeated cage sguads Saturday night, losing to the Trojans
69 to 71. Both games were played in the Pan-Pacific Auditorium in
west Los Angeles.
The Indians had won ten straight games before Saturday's loss

broke the string. The split ties the*
Cards for second place in the confer- I
ence along with USC. Cal scored a
double win over UCLA to lead the I
race.
Stanford held the lead in Friday j
night's game until the last five min
utes, when a Trojan hot streak tied |
it up. After the lead see-sawed for
two minutes, George Selleck took
the ball away from SC's Tony Psal
tis and passed to Don DeLong for an
easy layup.
DeLong's shot made the score 58-
57 for Stanford, and Coach Bob Bur- j
nett's injury-ridden crew held the j
lead for the rest of the game.
It was the work of Selleck and
Russ Lawler that dominated Friday's
game. Lawler outplayed Troy's Roy
Irvin both on offense and defense,
scoring 23 points for game high point
honors. Russ dropped in five left
handed hook shots in the first quar
ter to start the Indians on their way.
But it was the tiny tselleck who
stole the show. USC's highly touted
pair of guards, captain Dick Welsh
and Psaltis, had to take a back
seat to the little sophomore trick
ster from Compton.
Selleck scored 14 points, includ
ing eight out of nine free throws,
was all over the court on defense,
and set up most of his teammate's
scoring shots with his slick passing.
In Saturday night's game the Tro
jans turned the tables and hold the
lead until the last minute of play.
They were ahead by one point at

half time, due to a great extent, to
the fact that Lawler was knocked
unconscious in the second quarter.
The stringbean junior from Salinas
was forced to rest for several min
utes, but was back in action just be
fore half time.
Lawler and Selleck caught fire
with four minutes left in the game
and the Trojans leading by nine
points. They paced an eleven point
Stanford barrage that put the Cards
out in front, 69 to 67 with just a
minute left.
Psaltis tied the score with a set
shot from 20 feet out with 20 sec
onds to go, Lawler missed a hook,
and SC's Welsh broke downcourt
to put in the clinching bucket with
just three seconds remaining.
Selleck pumped in 19 points in'
Saturday's contest to be the high
scorer, once again oulplaying the
two Trojan guards. Lawler, shaking
off the results of being knockcd out,
scored 17 to register a two-game
total of 40 and take over the PCC
scoring lead.
Stanford played both games with
out the services of first-stringers
Ron Tomsic and Olcg SuzdalefT.
Tomsic is out for the season with a
knee injury, hut SuzdalefT, also suf
fering from a hurt knee, is expected
hack in action for this week end's
games against the pace - setting
Bears.
