# Houses Start Formal Rush
## 
### 
Formal activities started last,
night on the Row as 1954 fraternity
rushing moved into its second and
final week. Open houses, which had
been taking place in all 23 fraterni
ties since last Wedensday night,
ended yesterday afternoon.
Invitational luncheons, dinners,
and get - togethers at the houses,
date and non-date parties along the
Peninsula, and pledging activities
comprise the formal rush period.
This year formal rushing is of
somewhat shorter duration than in
past years, and will end Saturday
morning.
During open houses, rushees
could visit any of the fraternities at.
the times designated. In formal
rushing, no frosh or other rushec
may visit any house unless invited
by that house.
Some pledging bids were opened
to rushees last night and more will
be opened as the week progresses.
Until' next Saturday, men may
break their pledges. However, if a
pledge does this after Saturday, he
cannot join another fraternity until
after two quarters of University
residence, including summer quar
ter, following the quarter in which
the breaking of the pledge occurred.
"Freshmen and all other rushec:
arc advised to take plenty of time
to make their decisions regarding
fraternity pledging," said Gene Dils,
Interfraternity Council president.
"The rushee should get to know
the members of a certain house well,
particularly the sophomores and
juniors, before accepting a pin."
