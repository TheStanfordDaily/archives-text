# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
Things were going like things ought to be going
the other day at the Daily Shack. A frosh woman re
porter was writing a headline. The Associate Editor
was on the phone getting a story from the Dean of
Students' office. A Roble girl from Stockton was
painting her fingernails.

The Editor heard a fire siren
and began to sprint for the door.
A girl was proudly announcing
her engagement to a copyreader
who was taking down the de
tails. The Business Manager was
carrying a broken typewriter
away.
In short, things were going like
things should be going on a nor
mal day.
Then it happened. •

A girl walked in. Slio was a girl, just, like any
other girl, perhaps :i little better looking. She didn't
cause any excitement, until she opened her mouth.
In subdued tones, she said to me, "I would like
to work on sports department."
The frosh reporter stopped writing the headline.
The Roble girl from Stockton stopped painting her
fingernails. The Editor, on his way to the lire,
froze in his tracks. The girl stopped getting en
gaged. The Business Manager dropped the type
writer on his foot. Life in the Daily Shack halted
at that particular moment. All eyes were focused
on the newcomer.
The next line was mine, and I was nervous.

"Y-you're s-s-sure you want to work on sports
staff?" 1 said, stuttering worse than Mickey Rooney
if he were getting tackled-by the Notre Dame line.
"Yes, I am sure," she emphasized.
"Do you realize what this means?," I countered.
"The Daily has been publishing for almost (10 years,
and never, but never, have we let a woman en
croach on man's sacred domain of sports. Doesn't
tradition mean anything to you? We don't even
let women enter the part of (he Shack which is
the sports department, much less write for it. It's
unthinkable. Why don't you try writing for edi
torial side?"
"No, I want to write for sports. I've done sports
work for the Los Angeles Times and the Pasadena
Star-News, and T want to write sports for The
Daily."
"Well, what do you think of a girl writing for
sports?" I said, turning to a sports scribe.
He belched twice, looked wildly at the door, and
ran for it faster than a Russell girl heading home
after a 10:28 kiss in the Cactus Gardens.
However, the other sports writers were more
receptive to the idea of having a femme on
sports staff. Like six silent Indians coming out from
behind a bush, they surrounded her. I saw I had
no choice. A (iO-year tradition would be broken.
"Okay." I announced, "you're on sports staff. How'd
you like to do the dressing room stories?"
She slapped my face.
That's what you get for letting a girl on sports
staff.

porter was writing a headline. The Associate Editor
was on the phone getting a story from the Dean of
Students' office. A Roble girl from Stockton was
painting her fingernails.

The Editor heard a fire siren
and began to sprint for the door.
A girl was proudly announcing
her engagement to a copyreader
who was taking down the de
tails. The Business Manager was
carrying a broken typewriter
away.
In short, things were going like
things should be going on a nor
mal day.
Then it happened. •

A girl walked in. Slio was a girl, just, like any
other girl, perhaps :i little better looking. She didn't
cause any excitement, until she opened her mouth.
In subdued tones, she said to me, "I would like
to work on sports department."
The frosh reporter stopped writing the headline.
The Roble girl from Stockton stopped painting her
fingernails. The Editor, on his way to the lire,
froze in his tracks. The girl stopped getting en
gaged. The Business Manager dropped the type
writer on his foot. Life in the Daily Shack halted
at that particular moment. All eyes were focused
on the newcomer.
The next line was mine, and I was nervous.

"Y-you're s-s-sure you want to work on sports
staff?" 1 said, stuttering worse than Mickey Rooney
if he were getting tackled-by the Notre Dame line.
"Yes, I am sure," she emphasized.
"Do you realize what this means?," I countered.
"The Daily has been publishing for almost (10 years,
and never, but never, have we let a woman en
croach on man's sacred domain of sports. Doesn't
tradition mean anything to you? We don't even
let women enter the part of (he Shack which is
the sports department, much less write for it. It's
unthinkable. Why don't you try writing for edi
torial side?"
"No, I want to write for sports. I've done sports
work for the Los Angeles Times and the Pasadena
Star-News, and T want to write sports for The
Daily."
"Well, what do you think of a girl writing for
sports?" I said, turning to a sports scribe.
He belched twice, looked wildly at the door, and
ran for it faster than a Russell girl heading home
after a 10:28 kiss in the Cactus Gardens.
However, the other sports writers were more
receptive to the idea of having a femme on
sports staff. Like six silent Indians coming out from
behind a bush, they surrounded her. I saw I had
no choice. A (iO-year tradition would be broken.
"Okay." I announced, "you're on sports staff. How'd
you like to do the dressing room stories?"
She slapped my face.
That's what you get for letting a girl on sports
staff.

Things were going like things ought to be going
the other day at the Daily Shack. A frosh woman re
