# Wanted: Rain to Fill Lake Lag
## 
### 
By CONNIE GOMPERTS
Students' plans for spring
quarter canoeing and swimming
at Lake Lag may be just wishful
thinking this year. Unless we
have more rain like the down
pour last night, there may not
be enough water to fill the lake
bed.
So far, according to figures from i
the Stanford Engineering Office,
only 3.11 inches of rain have fallen
in the area since Aug. 1, as compared
to 12.12 inches at the same time last
year. This year's rainfall has been ■
the lowest since 1933, when only 2.70
inches had fallen by Jan. 11.
The scarcity of rain has had no- j
tieeable effects on the Stanford com- j
munity. There are no puddles by the j
Post Office to drench cars and un- j
wary pedestrians; giils wearing ban- I
danas to class have not yet become
an everyday sisht; and most import
ant of r.l'i, there is no water in Lake j
Lag.
Searsville Lake supplies the |
water for Lake Lag. When Sears- !
ville Lake comes to the overflow j
mark, it runs over into San Fran- j
cisquito Creek. Water from the
creek is dammed off near the Iso- 1
lation Hospital and (ills Lake Lag.
At the present time, Searsville |
L-ke contains only 118 million gal- ;
Ions; 2G5 million are needed to fill j
it.
However, th* l situation is not j
hope'ess. Many years the heavy
rainfall has come later on in the
senson: and downpours in late Janu
ary and early February, if strong
enough and continuous enough,
would be sufficient to tiil Lake Lag.
With o u I these downpours,
though, the "(nation looks fairly
gloomy. Without a water level
three f"et fr >m the I-n of the lake,
no boating, diving, or launching ;
of floats »<> possil.h . And when the
lake is only half full, a • it has been
in years like '9"9. the only activi
ties pov.ihh' are sunbathing aid
wading.

The most recent, years in which
the lake was not filled were spring
of 1947 and spring of 1948. The total
rainfalls for those years were 11.50
and 12.42 inches respectively.
In other years, students have
hod the frustrating experience of
serin;; the lake fill! for only a
week or two. If the rainfall is
spasmodic, as it has been in some
years, the lake loses water rapidly
through its silt bottom.

Good years in the lake's history
are those in which the rainfall starts
fairly early in the year and keeps
tip through most of winter quarter
and the first half of spring quarter.
In some years, the lake fills up a.s
early as February and stays full
through May.
This year, however, looks differ
ent. All the students can do is to
hope for some rain, rain, and more
rain. •

However, th* l situation is not j

rainfall has come later on in the
senson: and downpours in late Janu
ary and early February, if strong
enough and continuous enough,
would be sufficient to tiil Lake Lag.

lake is only half full, a • it has been

The most recent, years in which
the lake was not filled were spring
of 1947 and spring of 1948. The total
rainfalls for those years were 11.50
and 12.42 inches respectively.
In other years, students have
hod the frustrating experience of
serin;; the lake fill! for only a
week or two. If the rainfall is
spasmodic, as it has been in some
years, the lake loses water rapidly
through its silt bottom.

Good years in the lake's history
are those in which the rainfall starts
fairly early in the year and keeps
tip through most of winter quarter
and the first half of spring quarter.
In some years, the lake fills up a.s
early as February and stays full
through May.
This year, however, looks differ
ent. All the students can do is to
hope for some rain, rain, and more
rain. •

Students' plans for spring
quarter canoeing and swimming
at Lake Lag may be just wishful
thinking this year. Unless we
have more rain like the down
pour last night, there may not
be enough water to fill the lake
bed.
So far, according to figures from i
the Stanford Engineering Office,
only 3.11 inches of rain have fallen
in the area since Aug. 1, as compared
to 12.12 inches at the same time last
year. This year's rainfall has been ■
the lowest since 1933, when only 2.70
inches had fallen by Jan. 11.
The scarcity of rain has had no- j
tieeable effects on the Stanford com- j
munity. There are no puddles by the j
Post Office to drench cars and un- j
wary pedestrians; giils wearing ban- I
danas to class have not yet become
an everyday sisht; and most import
ant of r.l'i, there is no water in Lake j
Lag.
