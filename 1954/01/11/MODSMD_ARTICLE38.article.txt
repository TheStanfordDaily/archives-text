# JV's Lose First, Rebound to Win
## 
### 
Coach George Lynn's Stanford
Braves went down to their first de
feat of the season over the weekend
as they split a pair of games.
The JV's lost to the strong Ralph's
Barber Shop quintet 62 to 50 Fri
day night, but rebounded Saturday
afternoon to overwhelm Monterey
Peninsula College 94 to 42.
Ralph's, featuring Jim Ramstead
among its ex-Stanford stars, proved
to "have too much experience for
the Braves, and never trailed after
a close first half.
The JV's led 11 to 10 after a slow
first quarter, but Ralph's,'paced by
Ramstead who ended up as the
game's high scorer with 22 points,
nosed in front at the intermission
24 to 23.
Ralph's broke the game wide open
in the third quarter as they tallied
18 points, and they led by less than
four points after that.
Bob Milton was the leading scorer
for the Braves with 14 markers,
while Gunnar Christensen had 13.
Ken Berridge was runner -up to
Ramstead for Ralph's with 12.
Saturday's tilt with Monterey was
no contest as the JV's hit on an
amazing 60.5 percent of their shots
during the game and a fantastic
70.3 per cent in the second half
alone.
The Braves might have gone over
the 100-point mark for the game
had they not been off from the free
throw line. The JV's made but 16
of their 36 foul shots. Half-time
score was 40-23 in favor of the
Braves.
Bob McGrath and Dave Dunn
were tied for high scoring honors
for the JV's with 13 points apiece
while Paul Perko had 12, and Jerry
Gustafson and Bob McGreuther, 10
each.
Johti Hendricks provided a thrill
in the one-sided contest as he sank
a 50-foot shot as the buzzer sounded
ending the first period.
