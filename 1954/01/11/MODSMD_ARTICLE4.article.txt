# Medical Use Planned For Accelerator
## 
### 
A powerful new tool of nuclear
research — Stanford's billion - volt,
super-high frequency, 200-foot-long
electron linear accelerator—is going
to be made in junior sizes for cancer
therapy and inspection of industrial
products.
The "toned down" accelerators
will be manufactured and sold by
the X-ray Department, of General
Electric Company under a 10-year
agreement with the University, ac
cording to a joint announcement
released yesterday. They should be
on the market within the next few
years.
G.E. engineers will spend a year
at Stanford studying the design and
construction of linear accelerators,
including a pilot medical accelera
tor now being built. This six-mil
lion-volt, six-foot machine will be
installed at Stanford School of Med
icine in San Francisco, where radi
ologists plan to use it against deep
seated cancers by the end of 1954.
Stanford - designed accelerators
"shoot" electrons in a straight line
through a copper tube at. almost the
speed of light. High-voltage X-ra
diation can be produced when a
metal target is placed in the beam's
path.
This radiation has advantages
over lower-voltage X-rays in treat
ing deep-seated cancer, according
to various medical reports. Mote
of the high-energy radiation reach
es the depths of the body, less of it
affects the skin.
The electron beam may also be
used in cancer treatment without
converting it to X-rays, according
to Professors Eclward L. Ginzton
and Henry S. Kaplan, joint directors
of the pilot medical accelerator
project.
Dr. Ginzton heads the Microwave
Laboratory, where the Stanford ac
celerators arc designed and built.
Dr. Kaplan is chief of the Radiology
Department at Stanford School of
Medicine. When the medical ac
celerator is installed, Dr. Kaplan
will make extensive tests with ani
mals before using it in human can
cer therapy.
Stanford scientists who will work
with the G.E. engineers will include
those in the Microwave Laboratory
who are building the medical ac
celerator: Dr. Walter C. Barber, Ar
nold Eldredgc, Dr. N. C. Chang, and
Dr. Paul A. Pearson. Other Stan
ford accelerator specialists who will
be associated with the work are Dr.
Robert L. Kyhl, Dr. Richard B.
Neal, and Kenneth B. Mallory.
Stanford experts will also serve
as consultants at the G.E. X-ray
manufacturing plant in Milwaukee
for limited periods.
