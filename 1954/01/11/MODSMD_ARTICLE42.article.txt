# Frosh Trounce SI; Third Win
## 
### 
A greatly improved and still un
beaten freshman basketball team
won its third game of the season
Saturday by trouncing the previ
ously undefeated St. Ignatius High
School of San Francisco in the Pa
vilion, 71-GO.
A smooth, fast - breaking offense
and a tight zone defense proved to
I be the winning formula as Coach
Dick Clegg's cagers took an early
lead and never relinquished it, al
though the stubborn visitors never
gave up the fight.
Frosh Denis Mahoney, a tall for
ward from Piedmont, took game
scoring honors with 20 points, eight
of which were netted in the third
quarter. Bill Bond and Beppo Dyer
with 18 and 15 points respectively
also were high for the winners. The
high-schoolers were paced by Ray
Paxton with 17 markers and John
j Rubens with IG.
St. Ignatius, which had won 12
straight up to Saturday, played
<tn fairly even terms with the
frosh throughout the first quarter
as the latter led, 17-15, when the
i whistle blew. Height and speed j
paid off in the second period, i
however, as Mahoney and center !
Nick Vojvodich controlled the
backboards and the Papooses
rolled to a 39-31 advantage at the
intermission.
In the third period, the visitors
again matched the frosh almost
point for point although the deadly
one-hand jump shots of Mahoney
highlighted the action. A full court
press and a driving man-to-man
defense failed to stop Stanford in
the final quarter as both teams
never stopped fighting until the last
whistle. t
Not to be overlooked in the game
was the aggressive defensive play
of Dyer and Hup Wagner, both of
whom accounted for many ball
steals. Substitutes Carl Isaacs and
Dick Farman also looked good in
their reserve roll.
The frosh play two important
games this coming weekencj against
the California freshmen. Friday
night's game will be at Stanford,
while Saturday the squad travels to
| Berkeley for the game.
