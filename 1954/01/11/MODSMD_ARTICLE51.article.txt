# Rhodes Scholarship Winners Tell Study Plans for Oxford
## 
### JACK BYRNE DICK MANSFIELD 
'"It's a great honor; I hope that I
can live up to it." That's how Ralph
Amado feels about his recent grant
of a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford.
Scholarship interviews took a
portion of Amado's dead week time.
He flew to Los Angeles for inter
views before the committee, com
posed of former Rhodes Scholars
from the Western states and headed
by Robert Gordon Sproul, president
of the University of California.
Amado is the scholar for the Far
Western United States.
Amado plans to make the most
of his two-year trip. Current plans
call for "continuation of my studies
in physics, a bit of art, and a lot of
fencing''
None of these activities are new
to the 21 - year - old senior. At
Stanford, he has majored in phys
ics, and is a nearly straight-A
student. He is captain of the
fencing team, and is considered
one of the best collegiate fencers
in the Western states. As an ar
tist, he participates in a weekly
life drawing class, held evenings
in the Art Department. He is also
the rushing chairman for El Toro
club this year.
What will he do 'with the schol
arship? "I hope to get my B.S. in
nuclear physics." (Editor's note:
This is the highest non - research
degree granted by Oxford, and is
roughly equivalent to our Master's
degree.) "My scholarship is for two
years, with a possibility of renewal
for a third. I should be able to
complete my study in this time.
The Rhodes Scholarship was not
a passing thought to Amado. "I
originally became interested in high
school. My physics teacher's broth
er had been a Rhodes Scholar, and
he got me interested in trying for
the award. It's been one of my pet
projects ever since."
Amado was accorded honors on
entrance to Stanford. Since then,
he has maintained a position on the
Dean's List, been a chairman of the
Student - Faculty Education Com
mittee, worked as a research assist
ant in the Microwave Laboratory,
received three letters in fencing,
and has held many offices in El
Toro club. His home is in Los An
geles, where his father is an attor
ney.

Ronald A. Rebholz, who will at
tend Oxford University in England
as a Rhodes Scholar after one year
of graduate study in English at
Stanford, hopes to return here for
the Ph.D. degree.
"I came • here because I under
stood Stanford had the best English
Department on the West Coast; I
hope to return here for my degree,"
Rebholz said.
Rebholz came to Stanford from
St. Louis University, where he was
an English major and participated
in speech and debate activities. St.
Louis is his home. While at the
university, Rebholz also worked for
the campus newspaper and was
vice-president of the Student Coun
cil of the Arts and' Sciences School.
His Rhodes Scholarship came to
him through St. Louis University;
he flew east during dead week last
quarter to try out for it."I met a
Rhodes scholar at St. Louis Univer
sity who had spent two years at
Oxford," Rebholz said, "and he en
couraged me to try for this scholar
ship."
The scholarship entitles Reb
holz to two years at Oxford Uni
versity, with a chance to remain
for a third year, at a stipend of
£500 annually—about $1,400. "You
can spend the time in the field
of your choice, which will be
English literature in my case,"
Rebholz said.
"C. S. Lewis is the man at Oxford
I want to work under. He is a the
ologist and a Renaissance scholar,
with emphasis on Milton. I'm pri
marily interested in Renaissance
English literature."
Rebholz hopes to become a col
lege professor in Renaissance Eng
lish literature. Oxford offers an
A.B. degree—"roughly equivalent to
the M.A. degree here" in the hon
ours school of English literature
after two years of study, and what
is called a B.Litt.—Bachelor in Lit
erature — after three years. The
B.Litt. degree is what Rebholz calls
"just a step toward a Ph.D."
He plans to skip 19th century lit
erature — Oxford permits omission
of one period of literature for can
didacy for the A.B. honours school
degree—at Oxford and take it at
Stanford when he returns.
"I don't know how my draft
status will work out," Rebholz
said, "but I understand that the
scholarship will he held for me
if I am drafted." Rebholz has not
participated in any ROTC pro
gram.
When he has the Ph.D., Rebholz
hopes to teach at a Midwestern uni
versity. "I'd very much like to go
back to St. Louis University." he
said. But, he pointed out, St. Louis
University has just hired a new
professor in Renaissance English
literature.
