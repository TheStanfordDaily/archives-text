# Preliminary Atom Talks Begin Today

### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 10 (UP).
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles opens highly - secret
meetings tomorrow with Rus
sian Ambassador George N. Za
rubin which could put the world
on the road to international
atomic cooperation or intensify
the East-West stalemate.
The conferences (at 7:JO a.m. PST)
were arranged by Washington and
Moscow in an effort to set up top
level American-Russian talks on
President Eisenhower's dramatic
new plan to harness the atom for
peace.
An air ol' tight secrecy will sur
round the meetings between Dulles
and the bushy-browed Zarubin who
i.s a near stranger at the State De
partment. Officials said the meeting
would be "very private."
This is in line with Mr. Eisen
hower's offer before the United Na
tions to explore the atomic differen
ces between the two prime cold war
rivals in secret. The first disclosure
of what goes on may be an an
nouncement that a follow-up con
ference will—or will not—be held.
Meantime, chairman Homer Fer
guson (Mich.) of the Senate Repub
lican Policy Committee supported
Mr. Eisenhower's plan to give tacti
cal atomic information to other free
nations but said they should not get
U.S. nuclear secrets.
Under the President's proposal,
Russia, the United States, Britain,
and Canada would contribute fis
sionable materials to an interna
tional agency to he used in peace
ful atomic development through
out the world.
Mr. Eisenhower's idea was that
if atomic cooperation with Russia
could be developed on even a small
scale, it might lead eventually to a
compromise in the years-long strug
gle over atomic arms curbs and the
troublesome issue of international
inspection.
Dulles and Zarubin will try
merely to agree on a time, place,
and agenda for a top-level confer
ence to explore the President's plan.
They will make no effort to reach
agreement on specific phases of the
proposal.
