# Cal Studies Controversy On Winkler
## 
### BOB REZAK 
The University of California's
current controversy—involving
a political science professor, the
Board of Regents, and the stu
dent newspaper — drew the at
tention of the University's Com
mittee on Academic Freedom
yesterday.
After a meeting yesterday after
noon, the Committee expressed con
fidence in (he university adminis
tration's investigation of a statement
made last October by Harold Wink
ler, assistant professor of political
science.
Investigation of whether the Daily
Californian misquoted Winkler was
ordered by unanimous vote of the
Board of Regents last December,
after Regent John Francis Neylan
called attention to the student news
paper's report of a speech on "Lib
eralism" given by the professor last
October at an off-campus meeting of
the Hillel Society.
At the Regent's December meet
ing the university administration
disclosed that Winkler, one of the
original non-signers of the uni
versity's special loyalty oath, was
to he released in June because of
failure to conduct research.
The decision to release Winkler
had been made several months
earlier (presumably before the con
troversial statement was published),
it was announced then.
Winkler has publicly refuted the
statement published in the Daily
Cal, claiming that he was misquot
ed.
According to the Daily Cal, the
statement in question reads:
"It is all right to be a conserva
tive when the juice is dried up in
you, but there is something wrong
with a young person today, espe
cially in our rich and affluent
United States, who is not idcalis
tically inspired to the point of he
longing to a Communist, Socialist,
anarchist, or similarly inspired
group."
Winkler's version of this part of
his speech is:
"I can well understand how in
the comparatively rich United
States during the decades of the
:iO's and 40's young people were
idealistically motivated to join
Communist, Socialist, or anarchist
groups. Conservatism, when the
juice is dried up in one's veins, is
understandable, but there is some
thing wrong with a youngster who
is not motivated by generous
compassion for the underprivi
leged of the world."
The Academic Freedom Com
mittee yesterday said it had dis
cussed the "implications this case
may have on academic freedom."
According to its report on yester
day's meeting, the committee was
"convinced that a very careful in
vestigation is being made by the ad
ministration, and we are sure that
the procedures endorsed by the Ac
ademic Senate (the faculty's repre
sentative assembly) regarding cases
which may involve disciplinary ac
tion arc being followed by the ad
ministration.
The committee listed three points
which it said could be considered as
"lessons that may be learned from
this case."
1. "It is important that incor
rect statements which do damage
to the university and to the fac
ulty member be promptly and
clearly corrected.
2. "If the administration of the
university is to answer publicly
the complaints and charges
brought to it, it is an obligation
of the faculty to co-operate with
the administration in keeping it
fully informed in such matters.
!{. "It seems also to be a matter
of sound policy not to release
comments and criticism on fac
ulty members' statements before
making a careful and complete
investigation."

"It is all right to be a conserva
tive when the juice is dried up in
you, but there is something wrong
with a young person today, espe
cially in our rich and affluent
United States, who is not idcalis
tically inspired to the point of he
longing to a Communist, Socialist,
anarchist, or similarly inspired
group."
Winkler's version of this part of
his speech is:
"I can well understand how in
the comparatively rich United
States during the decades of the
:iO's and 40's young people were
idealistically motivated to join
Communist, Socialist, or anarchist
groups. Conservatism, when the
juice is dried up in one's veins, is
understandable, but there is some
thing wrong with a youngster who
is not motivated by generous
compassion for the underprivi
leged of the world."
The Academic Freedom Com
mittee yesterday said it had dis
cussed the "implications this case
may have on academic freedom."
According to its report on yester
day's meeting, the committee was
"convinced that a very careful in
vestigation is being made by the ad
ministration, and we are sure that
the procedures endorsed by the Ac
ademic Senate (the faculty's repre
sentative assembly) regarding cases
which may involve disciplinary ac
tion arc being followed by the ad
ministration.
The committee listed three points
which it said could be considered as
"lessons that may be learned from
this case."
1. "It is important that incor
rect statements which do damage
to the university and to the fac
ulty member be promptly and
clearly corrected.
2. "If the administration of the
university is to answer publicly
the complaints and charges
brought to it, it is an obligation
of the faculty to co-operate with
the administration in keeping it
fully informed in such matters.
!{. "It seems also to be a matter
of sound policy not to release
comments and criticism on fac
ulty members' statements before
making a careful and complete
investigation."
The University of California's
current controversy—involving
a political science professor, the
Board of Regents, and the stu
dent newspaper — drew the at
tention of the University's Com
mittee on Academic Freedom
yesterday.
After a meeting yesterday after
noon, the Committee expressed con
fidence in (he university adminis
tration's investigation of a statement
made last October by Harold Wink
ler, assistant professor of political
science.
Investigation of whether the Daily
Californian misquoted Winkler was
ordered by unanimous vote of the
Board of Regents last December,
after Regent John Francis Neylan
called attention to the student news
paper's report of a speech on "Lib
eralism" given by the professor last
October at an off-campus meeting of
the Hillel Society.
At the Regent's December meet
ing the university administration
disclosed that Winkler, one of the
original non-signers of the uni
versity's special loyalty oath, was
to he released in June because of
failure to conduct research.
The decision to release Winkler
had been made several months
earlier (presumably before the con
troversial statement was published),
it was announced then.
Winkler has publicly refuted the
statement published in the Daily
Cal, claiming that he was misquot
ed.
According to the Daily Cal, the
statement in question reads:
"It is all right to be a conserva
tive when the juice is dried up in
