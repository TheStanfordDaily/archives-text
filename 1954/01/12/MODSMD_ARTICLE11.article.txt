# Eisenhower Asks T-H Revision, Lowered Farm Price Supports
## Proposal for 'Gradual' Reductions Draws Fire From Both Parties 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 (UP) — President Eisenhower asked
Congress today to adopt flexible and generally lower farm price
supports to halt costly overproduction and spare the nation's
farmers from "arbitrary government control."
His proposal, outlined in a 7,000-word message to the House

and Senate, immediately
touched off the first skirmish in
what promised to be a long and
bitter Congressional debate over
Mr. Eisenhower's politically explo
sive plan.
The President emphasized that
the changeover from the present
rigidly high system of government
farm price supports should be "ac
complished gradually." He proposed
limiting the maximum drop to five
per cent a year, starting in 1955.
Meanwhile, to assure adequate
financing for farm programs, he
asked that the amount the gov
ernment is permitted to obligate
for price supports be increased
from $6,750,000,000 to $8,500,000,-
000. The present authorization is
almost used up.
Under the President's plan, gov
ernment price supports would be
reduced in surplus periods to dis
course overproduction and in
creased when additional farm out
put was desired. He said it would
help farmers "receive full parity in
the market" for their crops.
But he said the administration's
farm program "would appeal" to
farmers, "guarantee" abundant food
supply at reasonable prices for con
sumers, and"cost less" to taxpay
ers.
The plan was immediately at
tacked and supported on the Sen
ate floor by both Democrats and
Republicans.
Sen. William Langer (R., N.D.)
reported that the President had said
during the Presidential campaign
that "he was for 00 per cent parity."
He said this apparently was only
"campaign oratory" because there is
"nothing in this program that car
ries out promises made by the can
didate Eisenhower."
Mr. Eisenhower said present, law,
requiring 5)0 per cent parity on
basic crops, was intended to stimu
late farm production during war
time emergencies.' He said it was
"unworkable in peacetime" and has
piled up vast surpluses in govern
ment warehouses and priced farm
ers out of domestic and foreign
markets.
