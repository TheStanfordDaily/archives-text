# Final Open House At Clubs Tonight
## 
### 
The last open house on the Stan
ford eating clubs' freshman rushing
agenda will be held tonight at the
clubs' building from 8 to 10.
Club rushing and pledging ac
tivity is largely left up to individ
ual clubs; freshman men have been
guests at eating club meals and par
ties since the end of last quarter.
Tonight's is the third open house
held by the clubs for freshman men.
Eating clubs hold no joint pledge
signing ceremony, but individual
clubs arc planning ceremonies, din
ners, and dances starting this week
end.
Stanford's seven eating clubs, all
of which will be open to freshman
men tonight, arc Los Arcos, Break
ers, El Campo, El Capitan, El Cuadro,
El Tigre, and El Toro.
