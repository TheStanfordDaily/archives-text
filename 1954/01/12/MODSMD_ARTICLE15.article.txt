WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 (UP)—The United States today receives
& Communist proposal to resume preliminary talks on a Korean
peace conference and diplomatic sources said it probably will be
accepted.
The proposal reached the State Department as President Eisen-

Shower urged the Senate to ratify a
mutual security treaty that would
seal this country's pledge to aid
South Korea in case of renewed
Communist aggression.
The new Red proposal, made by
the Chinese Communist and North
Korean governments, suggested
that representatives of the Reds and
the United Nations meet at Pan
munjom Jan. 13 at 11 a.m. (Korean
time) to arrange for a resumption
of the talks.
The Red note was relayed here
by U.S. representative Kenneth T.
Young who received it.from Com
munist truce negotiators at Pan
munjom. -
State Department spokesman
Henry Suydam said the Red pro
posal did not mention the Com
munist charge of U.S. "perfidy,"
the accusation that caused U.S.
envoy Arthur H. Dean to quit the
preliminary talks.
Dean has said he will not return
until the Reds withdrew the charge.
Suydam would not say whether this
country now will insist on a with
drawal. There have been reports
the Communists would agree to a
compromise by which they would
withdraw their "perfidy" charge
while the United States canceled
the "stooge" label it pinned on the
Reds.
Suydam said he could not com
ment on the Red proposal until the
Department studies it and consults
with its other Allies in the Korean
fighting. Representatives of the 16
nations that fought on the U.N. side
met here today. Suydam would not
say whether the new Red proposal
came up.
It is known, however, that the
! United States wants to resume the
: stalled talks and probably will ac
cept the Red proposal if it contains
■ no hidden tricks.
