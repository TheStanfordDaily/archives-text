# Changes Urged: Ban on Boycotts, Controversial Secret Strike Vote
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 (UP) — President Eisenhower asked
Congress today to "reinforce" the Taft-Hartley law by making 14
changes, including a sharply-controversial proposal for govern
ment-conducted secret votes before workers can go on strike.
Asserting the law needs "no drastic . . . innovations," he called

for protecting the rights of strik
ing unions for at least four
months, easing the ban on sec
ondary boycotts, and requiring em
ployers to swear they are not Com
munists.
Among major changcs, he urged
that employers be forbidden to seek
an NLRB election to choose a new
union during a strike, up to a year,
and that other unions be barred
from seeking a contest against the
striking union for four months after
the strike starts.
He proposed retention of the
80 - day injunction in "national
emergency" strikes, but urged
that Presidential fact - finding
boards set up under tins clause
l>c allowed to make recommenda
tions for settling the disputes.
Now they merely report on the
issues.

John L. Lewis, United Mine
Workers chief who has labeled the
Taft-Hartley Act a "slave labor"
law, scornfully condemned the pro
posals as "piddling amendments."
He said they would not make the
law "wholesome or acceptable" to
labor.
Other union leaders were shocked
by the proposal to have the govern
ment conduct strike ballots. Union
spokesmen said the leaders were
surprised at the implication they
have not conducted strike ballots
fairly. They said they had never
heard the idea discussed.
Mr. Eisenhower, in his message,
said there is nothing that affects
an employee "so vitally" as "the
loss of his pay when he is called
on strike."
"In such an important decision,"
he. said, "he should have an oppor
tunity to express his free choice by
secret ballot under government
auspices."
Reliable sources said the Presi
dent made his surprise proposal at
the urging of Commerce Secretary
Sinclair Weeks. Some influential
members of Congress tried to talk
administration officials out of tho
idea but Weeks insisted, it was ssaid.
