# STANFORD—TODAY AND TOMORROW
## Dean Winbigler Discusses Farm Admissions, Advising 
### WALT WILLIAMS 
Speaking on University academics, Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler last night began the winter quarter series of Stanford—
Today and Tomorrow discussions. The Dean spoke to Stern and
Crothers Hall residents in the Stern lounge.
Dean Winbigler devoted most of his talk to an explanation of

Stanford's advising system and ad
missions program.
He described lower division ad
visers as "fundamentally academic
officers." He pointed out that ad
vising is done on a voluntary basis,
and that methods and techniques
are left to the individual advisers.
A student may change advisers
at any time by filing a request,
he pointed out.
Explaining the University's ad
mission policy, Dean Winbigler said
that all selections are made by the
Faculty Committee on Admissions.
The Committee, he said, makes
its choices on the lower division
level on the basis of three cri
teria — the applicant's acadcmic
record, his score on the aptitude j
test given by the College En
trance Examination Board, and his
personal qualifications. The same
criteria are used on (he upper di
vision level', he added, but less
emphasis is placed on the aptitude
test.
On the, lower division level, he
said that approximately one third
of the women applicants and two
thirds of the men applicants arc ac
cepted.
The Dean explained that although
every state in the Union has been
represented on the student body for
several years, no geographical" quo- ;
tas are used by the admissions com- I
mittee. Applicants are considered ir- |
respective of secondary school or i
geographic area.
In response to a question from
the floor, Dean Winbigler ex
plained that the picture on the
application helps in making an
overall judgment on the appli
cant's personal qualifications.
The Dean was introduced by Buzz |
Fcinberg, Interclub chairman and |
member of the Stanford—Today and
Tomorrow steering committee.
The discussion series will be con
tinued tomorrow night, when Dr.
Douglas M. Whitaker, University ;
Provost, will address the Village
graduate students at 7 p.m. in the
Village Clubhouse.

criteria are used on (he upper di
vision level', he added, but less
emphasis is placed on the aptitude
test.
On the, lower division level, he
said that approximately one third
of the women applicants and two
thirds of the men applicants arc ac
cepted.
The Dean explained that although
every state in the Union has been
represented on the student body for
several years, no geographical" quo- ;
tas are used by the admissions com- I
mittee. Applicants are considered ir- |
respective of secondary school or i
geographic area.
In response to a question from
the floor, Dean Winbigler ex
plained that the picture on the
application helps in making an
overall judgment on the appli
cant's personal qualifications.
The Dean was introduced by Buzz |
Fcinberg, Interclub chairman and |
member of the Stanford—Today and
Tomorrow steering committee.
The discussion series will be con
tinued tomorrow night, when Dr.
Douglas M. Whitaker, University ;
Provost, will address the Village
