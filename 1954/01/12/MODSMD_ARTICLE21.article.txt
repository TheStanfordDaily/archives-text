# Hushing?—Slow Down
## 
### 
This is the time of rushing.
It is the tirnr? when the masculine handshake,
the congenial smile, and the resonant voice are
used as ciiteria in the judging of men. It is the
time when athletic- records, academic standing,
and the social skills are studied in efforts to
sift "qualified" men out of the great quantity of
men at Stanford.
But, we feel, the "study" is superficial. The
very term for this sifting process, "rushing," in
dicates the pace in which it is conducted. It is
a fast pace. Its speed is variously described as
"dizzying," whirling," and "picking up momen
tum." s
It is too fast. Impressions on the qualities
of men are quickly drawn. Decisions to ac
c< pt individual men or to join groups of men
are made in haste. There is not enough time
to look beyond characteristics which
at mediately recognizable. 'I'here is not
enough time to judge completely and fairly
the nature of individuals and (/roups.

There should be. The decisions which will
be made this week, the decisions to accept or
reject a man, the decisions to join a fraternity
or club or to remain independent, will seriously
affect and condition the lives of the men in
volved. Those decisions should be made with
a thorough understanding of groups and indi
viduals an understanding which takes time to
achieve, more time than has been designated
by the present "rushing" system.
The system should, we believe, be changed
to extend the time of the "rusning seasons." It
shoyld be changed so that rushees, fraternities,
and clubs can make their decisions with un
qualified confidence.
Until it is, many rushees must decide now,
probably in haste, or wait for a year.
And we believe that rushees should not hesi
tate to wait that year—if their decisions this
week must be quick and reluctant decisions.
