Word has filtereil down out of* the befrosted Pa
( die Northwest that Oregon State College's basketball
team boasts a center who is 7 ft. 3 in. tall'. This
touler, name of Swede Halbrook, stands on tiptoe
and drops the basketball into the basket. Did it often
enough to help OSC beat Indiana a while back. A

wag has suggested that The Daily
run a photograph of Halbrook—
in installments.
"ft wouldn't fail!" said the wag,
name of Elmore Seeds. '"Don't
miss tomorrow's thrilling episode
of Swede Halbrook!' We could
run it life-size! At a foot a day,
it would take eight days with a
dividend of three inches on the
last day. Think of it!"
While thinking> of it, we stop

to ponder the origin of the seven-foot center in
basketball. The seven-foot center was invented
by Henry Ilia, basketball coach at Oklahoma A & M,
to placate a current student demand for his scalp.
The Iba scoring machine, name of Boh Kuriand,
set otl a reaction.
Now the woods are thick with them. In the
Northwest:, Washington is bringing along a freshman
who is seven feet tall and weighs about 97 pounds.
It he fills out and learns how to jump, Halbrook will
have to start skipping rope. Meanwhile, a Seattle
high school has a mere child of ti ft. 8 in.—"But he's
growing!" says his coach. He has yet to be seen with
both teet off the floor, but give him another year and
fie won't have to jump.
As everything, there are those who liave and
those who have not. Fireman O'Toole, excitable
mentpr ot Central Oregon Poly, has never had a

basketball player over 6 feet tall. Plenty-tall enough
for old-fashioned ball, perhaps, but not in these
tall times. So Fireman O'Toole acquired the Mork
twins, Philo and Ziggy, both of whom stood four
feet tall.
Philo would climb into a large pair of basketball
pants and then Ziggy would stand on his shoulders
and pull on a large basketball shirt. Philo was a fine
jumper and Ziggy had a great hook shot; between
them they promised Central Oregon Poly success.
Central Oregon Poly bowled over Bend High School,
whipped Gilchrist Loggers, and outbattled Sisters
Recreational League All-Stars. It looked like an
undefeated season.
Then Philo tired. The Mork brothers started
switching positions in mid-game. This promised to
work out well, since Ziggy could drive well and
Philo was adept with a two-handed set shot.
But Zilo Mork proved to be too much for the fans.
They used a simple technique to change positions;
they never left their basketball suit. Ziggy would
jump down onto the floor, and then Philo, the great
jumper, would jump up on Ziggy's shoulders.
This really had 'em in the aisles. It looked like
Zilo Mork was having a convulsion. After the first
performance of this astounding new answer to bas
ketball's height problem, they carried one alumnus
out on a shutter.
Of course, Central Oregon Poly didn't have too
many men on the floor, since one Mork remained on
the other's shoulders during actual play, but people
begfcn to get a trifle jittery, and then it was found
Philo and Ziggy were taking too many course units
between them to be eligible to participate in any
activities as an individual. That ended a beautiful
fable.
