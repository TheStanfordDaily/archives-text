MAYBE SHE ISN'T A BIG-CITY GAL—Miss Liberty (right), since 1886 a fixture in New York
Harbor, may or may not be a New Yorker. Mrs. Evelyn Hill, who operates a refreshment and sou
venir shop on Bedloe's Island (A), site of the Statue of Liberty, is suing for the return of $1,949 in
taxes paid to New York City on the grounds that the island is west of the New York-New Jersey
border (broken line). The city maintains that Bedloe's belongs to New York. Other points are
Ellis Island (B), Jersey shore (C), Manhattan (D), and Governor's Island. —NEA Telephoto
