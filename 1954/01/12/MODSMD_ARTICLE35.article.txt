## POT SHOTS

Stanford lans have long felt that in Chuck Taylor and Bob Burnett they
have two of the nation's top young coaches, but seldom has this been so
conclusively proven as in the last two weeks. *
In coaching the West to a 31 to 7 victory over the star-studded East
squad, Taylor demonstrated that he has brought a new concept of offense
into college football. The basic play of a Taylor-coached team is the for
ward pass with running plays coming off the fake pass and trap-blocking
patterns and designed solely to keep the defense honest. This offense de
veloped during Stanford's last six games, but we have a feeling it came
of age in the Shrine tilt.
Next year with under-rated Jack Gebert at the helm, a boy who can
run as well as throw, and a stubborn line able to give him the time he
needs, watch Stanford roll.

Burnett has also shown the ability to come up with innovations when the
situation called for it. Burnett has moved his pint-sized guards out from
the backboard toward mid-court where height doesn't matter. Enemy
guards taking the ball down court find Stanford's two guards harassing
them as soon as they cross mid-court.
Selleck and Suzdalefl" (or Wagner last week end) make up in agility
what they lack in height. Thev occasionally steal the ball, but more
important, they don't give the opposition time to set up their plays.
Stanford's ten and one record attests to the success of this new pressing
type defense; and the one defeat last Saturday was of the most heart
breaking ever. Stanford was five points behind two minutes left to go.
First-.stringers Tomsic and SuzdalefT were out with injuries and forwards
DcLong and Brown had fouled out, yet the patched-up Card line-up tied
the score only to lose in the last three seconds.
This last minute swisher robbed Mr. Burnett of some of the glory
li«* deserves, but here is a belated salute to two top coaches.

It will take more than good coaching and hustle to defeat Cal this
week end, however. We think the Bears have the strongest team the
.southern division has seen since the war. Bobs Albo, McKeen, and Matheny
ate playing All-League ball (how about Lawler and Selleck for the other
two posts). Albo and McKeen are death under the boards, while Matheny,
Frank Hess, and Larry Jones or Dick Tamberg stand around and hit from
20 to .'JO feet out,
We look for the Bears to go all the way to the NCAA finals before losing
to Indiana or Kentucky and a win for Stanford this week end would be a
great triumph for the Cards and Mr. Burnett.
