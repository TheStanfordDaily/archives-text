# A 						REPORT FROM AL MASTERS
## NCAA Retains 1953 TV Plan to Save the Gate 
### RUSS WILKS 
Television was the biggest problem of the college athletic ad
ministrators, reported A 1 Masters, Director of Athletics, after re
turning yesterday from the Jan. 6-8 meetings in Cincinnati.
Masters represented Stanford at the general policy meeting of
the NCAA. Everett Dean attended the NCAA baseball meeting.

Stanford wasn't represented at the'
American Football Coaches' Asso
ciation meeting which also was in
Cincinnati.
The big headache among the
problems of gate receipts, eligibility,
and strengthening and enforcing of
codes of conduct was the television
question. There were three schools
of thought on this subject at the
meeting, said Masters.
"One favored unlimited televi
sion. This would kill gate receipts
and therefore kill football. The
competition would be too much.
People would rather sit home and
be able to see any number of top
games."
Survey Report
Masters reported the results of a
survey that had been taken on the
effects of TV on gate receipts.
"The survey definitely proved
that television cuts into the gate
receipts. I favored the second alter
native, that of regional control.
This, however, could only work out
here on the Pacific Coast.
"There is a natural barrier be
tween the Pacific Coast District No.
8 and the Rocky Mountain District
No. 7. Regional television wouldn't
overlap out here, but in the other
sections it would. In the East, for
example, there is only an artificial
line between Districts No. 1 and
No. 2. People in these districts
would be able to pick up TV games
from both sections."
The final plan was for retention
of last season's policy of televising
"The Game of the Week." This was
the proposal that was introduced
out of committee and was adopted
by the NCAA by a 172 to 9 vote.
Stanford voted in favor of it. It
took a full day's discussion before
the question finally came to a vote.
Masters Favored Action
Masters favored the NCAA's lim
iting the football season to 10 games
(excluding post-season games) and
the basketball season to 2(> games,
but was disappointed in the inter
pretation given to the rule.
Stanford's Athletic Director re
ported that "This rule is to apply to
only scheduled games and doesn't
consider practice games. This means
*a team can play any number of
practice games and really isn't lim
ited. Therefore the rule actually
means nothing."
Masters said the PCC would prob

ably stick with its ruling on 10
football and 27 basketball games
(scheduled and practice).
Stanford attempted to get its mo
tion (that senior skiers, who had
participated on the varsity when
they were freshmen, be allowed to
participate in the NCAA champion
ship meet) through, but the meas
ure was defeated. This was in
keeping with the NCAA policy that
no athlete who has participated on
a varsity squad for more than three
years can compete in a champion
ship contest.
One of the developments of the
football coaches' meeting, which
agreed to work in harmony with the
NCAA in enforcing rules of con
duct, was the adoption of a program
to improve coaching ethics.
Unethical Practices
The coaches termed the following
practices unethical: picking weekly
game winners, organizing sideline
coaching, faking injuries, scouting
opponents' practice sessions, falsify
ing players' weights, and exchang
ing game movies (except when au
thorized). It also set Sept. 1 (or
two weeks prior to the beginning of
classes) as the earliest starting date
for fall football practice and Nov. 1
for basketball practice, with no
game being played before Dec. 1.
Masters labeled the meeting as a
success and added that "The NCAA
is essential- to maintain. It takes
care of the schools which are out of
line and sets the athletic tone for
the country."

"There is a natural barrier be
tween the Pacific Coast District No.

No. 7. Regional television wouldn't
overlap out here, but in the other
sections it would. In the East, for
example, there is only an artificial
line between Districts No. 1 and
No. 2. People in these districts
would be able to pick up TV games
from both sections."
The final plan was for retention
of last season's policy of televising
"The Game of the Week." This was
the proposal that was introduced
out of committee and was adopted
by the NCAA by a 172 to 9 vote.
Stanford voted in favor of it. It
took a full day's discussion before
the question finally came to a vote.
Masters Favored Action
Masters favored the NCAA's lim
iting the football season to 10 games
(excluding post-season games) and
the basketball season to 2(> games,
but was disappointed in the inter
pretation given to the rule.
Stanford's Athletic Director re
ported that "This rule is to apply to
only scheduled games and doesn't
consider practice games. This means
*a team can play any number of
practice games and really isn't lim
ited. Therefore the rule actually
means nothing."
Masters said the PCC would prob

ably stick with its ruling on 10
football and 27 basketball games
(scheduled and practice).
Stanford attempted to get its mo
tion (that senior skiers, who had
participated on the varsity when
they were freshmen, be allowed to
participate in the NCAA champion
ship meet) through, but the meas
ure was defeated. This was in
keeping with the NCAA policy that
no athlete who has participated on
a varsity squad for more than three
years can compete in a champion
ship contest.
One of the developments of the
football coaches' meeting, which
agreed to work in harmony with the
NCAA in enforcing rules of con
duct, was the adoption of a program
to improve coaching ethics.
Unethical Practices
The coaches termed the following
practices unethical: picking weekly
game winners, organizing sideline
coaching, faking injuries, scouting
opponents' practice sessions, falsify
ing players' weights, and exchang
ing game movies (except when au
thorized). It also set Sept. 1 (or
two weeks prior to the beginning of
classes) as the earliest starting date
for fall football practice and Nov. 1
for basketball practice, with no
game being played before Dec. 1.
Masters labeled the meeting as a
success and added that "The NCAA
is essential- to maintain. It takes
care of the schools which are out of
line and sets the athletic tone for
the country."
Television was the biggest problem of the college athletic ad
ministrators, reported A 1 Masters, Director of Athletics, after re
turning yesterday from the Jan. 6-8 meetings in Cincinnati.
Masters represented Stanford at the general policy meeting of
the NCAA. Everett Dean attended the NCAA baseball meeting.

Stanford wasn't represented at the'
American Football Coaches' Asso
ciation meeting which also was in
Cincinnati.
The big headache among the
problems of gate receipts, eligibility,
and strengthening and enforcing of
codes of conduct was the television
question. There were three schools
of thought on this subject at the
meeting, said Masters.
"One favored unlimited televi
sion. This would kill gate receipts
and therefore kill football. The
competition would be too much.
People would rather sit home and
be able to see any number of top
games."
Survey Report
Masters reported the results of a
survey that had been taken on the
effects of TV on gate receipts.
"The survey definitely proved
that television cuts into the gate
receipts. I favored the second alter
native, that of regional control.
This, however, could only work out
here on the Pacific Coast.
"There is a natural barrier be
