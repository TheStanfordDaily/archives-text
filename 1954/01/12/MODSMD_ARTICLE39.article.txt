### 
Stanford's basketballing In
dians, ranked 18th in the nation
by International News Service,
open their home conference
season this weekend against the
awesome California Bears.
Trainer Connie Jarvis was a
bearer of good news yesterday. He
said, "Olie Suzdaleff will be able to
start at guard. He won't be at full
effectiveness, but he could have
played last week. However, we
thought it was better to spare his
knee the punishment of the Pan
Pacific floor, which is like concrete."
Coach Bob Burnett, the man
with (he Ipann ivories, came hack
from the Southland enthused with
his team's work in the USC split.

Said Burnett, "I thought our kids
were absolutely marvelous against
USC. We had no right being on the
same court with them with all the
disadvantages we had. But the boys
played inspired ball. Ron Wagner,
who had never started a varsity ball
game, was great. George Selleck
and Russ Lawler were outstanding."
"If the football team played a
I game like we did down south,
| they'd be writing it up in the pa
| pei's for 20 weeks."
Stanford edged the Trojans, til
to 59, on Friday, and then was
nipped, 71 to 69. on Saturday.
Cal, the menacing form of the ho
| rizon, dropped rugged UCLA twice,
(52 to 53 and 73 to 65.
Friday's game will be in the Pa
j vilion. On Saturday, the two teams
1 move over to Berkeley.
