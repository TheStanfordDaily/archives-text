EASY ACES?—So far this trio of
Hobs has been anything hut easy
for the opposition as it has paced
the California quintet to 12 victo
ries in 14 games. Against UCLA
it scored 8(5 of Cal's 135 points.
Stanford's fired-up cagers have to
stoj) the hoggish rebounding of
McKccn and Alho and the play
making of Matheny in order to
sweep or split in this weekend's !
series. The two teams play in the
Pavilion Friday and move to Ber
keley Saturday.—ASUC photo
