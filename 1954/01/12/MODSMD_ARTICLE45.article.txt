# PUBLIC RELATIONS COMMITTEE
## Reorganized For Efficiency 
### SALLY YATES 
No, that's not Greek you'll see
stretched across the Row on the
Row banner as you head for
class this morning. It's "public
ity" spelled backward.
The banner is one of many
signs that will go up around
Quad today to draw students'
attention to the newly reorganized j
ASSU Public Relations Committee.
The most recent phase of the
Public Relations Committee's reor
ganization program began last night
when members of large campus
groups such as Cardinals, Drives
Committee, and the senior class-met
to form a Co - ordinating Board
which will plan a publicity calendar
for the rest of the year. .
Each of the large groups was as
signed times and places to publicize
its events. Smaller clubs will be of- i

fered use ot publicity facilities after
the larger groups have indicated
their preference for time and space.
Pub Rel Com is divided into two
sub-committees: the Service Com

mittee, headed by Dick Castle, and |
the Publicity Committee, headed by
Sally Moseman.
The publicity committee is bro
ken down into two boards: the
advisory hoard, headed by Rocky J
Rhodes, and the regulatory '
board, headed by Jack Lovelace.
These boards will help any groups
which want to publicize future
events or activities and will han
dle applications for use of the
silk screen, the banner in front of
the Cellar, the loudspeaker sys
tem, the mimeograph machine,
and movie slides.
Ann Heyn, art director, is respon- j
sible for much of the art work on |
the posters created in the Pub Rel I
Com oflice. To acquaint, students
more fully with the proper use of
the silk screen, an invaluable time
saver in poster - making, Karen
Saum plans to give informal in
j struction to those interested some
| time in the near future.
While acting as publicity agent is
Pub Rel Corn's more well-known
function, an equally important duty
is that of acting as corresponding
secretary for the ASSU.
The external services program,
i under Mickey Townsend. answers

I letters from othet schools which j
I request information about Stan
| ford and also sends out newslet
ters to local merchants every
quarter, telling of Stanford events
I which might interest them. With |
Cardinals, this ,»roup is trying to
| set up a High School Day in the
Los Angeles area sometime this
i quarter.
Headed by Jane Peterson, the in
} ternal services committee cements
I relations between students and fac
ulty members and betweeVi the AS
SU and the students. A! Ivey, a
I member of this group and ol ASSU l
Executive Committee, prints the |
I Excom newsletter which is placed
in all living groups periodically.
Pub Rel Com also makes students \
aware of the various aspects of I
Stanford life through support of the
Stanford — Today and Tomorrow
committee.

No, that's not Greek you'll see
stretched across the Row on the
Row banner as you head for
class this morning. It's "public
ity" spelled backward.
The banner is one of many
signs that will go up around
Quad today to draw students'
attention to the newly reorganized j
ASSU Public Relations Committee.
The most recent phase of the
Public Relations Committee's reor
ganization program began last night
when members of large campus
groups such as Cardinals, Drives
Committee, and the senior class-met
to form a Co - ordinating Board
which will plan a publicity calendar
for the rest of the year. .
Each of the large groups was as
signed times and places to publicize
its events. Smaller clubs will be of- i

fered use ot publicity facilities after
the larger groups have indicated
their preference for time and space.
Pub Rel Com is divided into two
sub-committees: the Service Com

mittee, headed by Dick Castle, and |
the Publicity Committee, headed by
Sally Moseman.
The publicity committee is bro
ken down into two boards: the
advisory hoard, headed by Rocky J
Rhodes, and the regulatory '
board, headed by Jack Lovelace.
These boards will help any groups
which want to publicize future
events or activities and will han
dle applications for use of the
silk screen, the banner in front of
the Cellar, the loudspeaker sys
tem, the mimeograph machine,
and movie slides.
Ann Heyn, art director, is respon- j
sible for much of the art work on |
the posters created in the Pub Rel I
Com oflice. To acquaint, students
more fully with the proper use of
the silk screen, an invaluable time
saver in poster - making, Karen
Saum plans to give informal in
j struction to those interested some
| time in the near future.
While acting as publicity agent is
Pub Rel Corn's more well-known
function, an equally important duty
is that of acting as corresponding
secretary for the ASSU.
The external services program,
i under Mickey Townsend. answers

I letters from othet schools which j
I request information about Stan

ters to local merchants every

I which might interest them. With |

Los Angeles area sometime this
i quarter.
