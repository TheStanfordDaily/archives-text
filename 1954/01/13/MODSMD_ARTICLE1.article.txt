# Series Talk Tells Faith Of Humanist
## 
### BILL WRIGHT 
Faith for a humanist is "the
hope that charity is not in vain,"
Dr. Albert L. Guerard declared
last night in his Tuesday Eve
ning Series lecture in Memorial
Auditorium.
Dr. Guerard, an emeritus profes
sor of general literature at Stan
ford, outlined the creed of a human
ist in the first series lecture of win
ter quarter.
In his talk, entitled "The Testa
ment of a Humanist," he summarized
his four autobiographical books.
Dr. Guerard said that "faith is
not an unquestioned belief in cer
tain material events" nor a "literal
acceptance of myths as beautiful as
they may be," but the realization
that "there is a sense in this uni
verse."
"When that sense is blurred," he
added, "I am unhappy."
The motto of a humanist, Dr.
Guerard said, is "I am a man and I
take nothing human alien to me."
Because of this bond with all man
kind, the humanist's ultimate faith
is that there is charity for all.
"The Humanist chooses to be a
man—a gentle man—to live so that
he won't have to despise himself,"
Dr. Guerard said.
Man loses his dignity and his self
respect when he loses his freedom of
thought. "In thought you shall seek
the truth,"he stated, "and in the
seeking you arc free."
The speaker emphasized that the
field encompassed by a humanist
cannot be bounded, that it invades
the social sciences.
Since the first amendment guaran
tees the free expression of ideas, the
humanist enters the political sphere.
Dr. Guerard said that the state
must protect itself from acts of trea
son and preparations for acts of
treason, but that thoughts must he
combattcd not by enforced silence
but by stronger, more persuasive
thoughts.
"The humanist is rational within
reason," Dr. Guarard said. In say
ing this he denies "the absolute va
lidity of formal logic" and acknowl
edges that there arc "forces outside
of pure reason."
Dr. Guerard was introduced by
John W. Dodds, Stanford professor
of English and director of Special
Programs in Humanities.
