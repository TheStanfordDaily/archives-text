# Reds Reply To U.N. Note
## 
### 
TOKYO, Wednesday, Jan. 13 (UP).
The United Nations offered to meet
witli the Communists tomorrow in
efforts to resume negotiations to ar
range a Korean peace conference
and the Reds replied today in a
note which apparently did not meet
U.N. conditions.
The Comunist note —third in the
exchange aimed at getting the talks
on arrangements for the conference
under way again—was delivered to
Kenneth Young, interim U.N. rep
resentative, at Panmunjom.
Young would not disclose contents
of the Communist reply. He said it
had been sent to Washington.
The Communists had proposed
(he liaison meeting "set the date"
for the resumption of the talks.
The IT.N. suggested that it also de
ride "the conditions" under which
they would he resumed, appar
ently a reference to the U.N. de
mand that the Reds must retract
their charges of American treach
ery.
U.S. Ambassador Arthur H. Dean
broke off negotiations with the
Communists Dec. 12 when they ac
cused the United States of "perfidy"
in the release of 27,000 anti-Red
North Korean prisoners by the
South Korean government last June.
A Communist-called meeting of
the Military Armistice Commission
recessed after one hour today during
j discussion of the tangled war pris
| oner situation.
No reason was given for the re
cess. Usually, however, recesses arc
called to consider a proposal ad
vanced by one side.
The U.S. State Department sent
Young instructions yesterday to
suggest liaison officers meet at Pan
munjom Thursday.
