# Meeting Set On Winkler Case Today
## 
### BOB REZAK 
A group of research assistants, j
graduate students, and teaching
assistants at the University of
California announced it was
planning to hold a meeting to
day to discuss the case of Harold j
Winkler, JC assistant profes- j
sor of political science whose
dismissal from the university;
has prompted a campus contro- i
versy.
The group, called the Non-Aca- |
demic Employees of the University, ;
said it would meet to make a defi
nite policy and take actions relating
to the Winkler case.
Another group, the campus j
chapter of the American Associa- 1
tion of University Professors, said
it would hold a special member
ship meeting on the Winkler situ
ation Friday. The chapter has
about .'{oo members.
Winkler is being released at the
end of the school year because he
has not published any findings of
significant nature, university offi
cials said.
The controversy over Winkler,
however, arose when he made an
oIT-campus speech on "Liberalism."
The speech was reported in (he
Daily California!!, student news
paper.
The paper quoted Winkler as say
ing, "It's all right to be a conserva
tive when the juice is dried up in
you, but there is something wrong
with a young person today . . . who
is not idealistically inspired to the
point of belonging to a Communist,
Socialist, anarchist, or similarly in
spired group."
Winkler denies having made the
statement and charges he was mis
; quoted.
Peter Odegard, chairman of the
university's political science depart
ment, said he appealed the Winkler
qase to UC Chancellor Clark Kerr
without success.
Odegard said that the. case of
Winkler was not merely a case of
failing to meet requirements, hut
also reflerts the pressures restrict
ing academic freedom today.
In a letter to Kerr, Odegard
said:
"One is tempted to ask how far
we have progressed towards a
point where off-campus remarks
must pass muster with the (Board
of) Regents and/or the University
administrative authorities on pain
of being denounced, disgraced, or
dismissed."
Odegard described Winkler a« one
of the "ablest teachers we have had
in the political science department
and in the university."
He said Winkler was "stimulating,
infectious, and has never used the
classroom for propaganda."

point of belonging to a Communist,
Socialist, anarchist, or similarly in
spired group."
Winkler denies having made the
statement and charges he was mis
; quoted.
Peter Odegard, chairman of the
university's political science depart
ment, said he appealed the Winkler
qase to UC Chancellor Clark Kerr
without success.
Odegard said that the. case of
Winkler was not merely a case of
failing to meet requirements, hut
also reflerts the pressures restrict
ing academic freedom today.
In a letter to Kerr, Odegard
said:
"One is tempted to ask how far
we have progressed towards a
point where off-campus remarks
must pass muster with the (Board
of) Regents and/or the University
administrative authorities on pain
of being denounced, disgraced, or
dismissed."
Odegard described Winkler a« one
of the "ablest teachers we have had
in the political science department
and in the university."
He said Winkler was "stimulating,
infectious, and has never used the
classroom for propaganda."
