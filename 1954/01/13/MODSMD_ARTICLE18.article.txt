### 
Slides of the University of the
Philippines in Manila and of the
islands in general were shown last
night by 112. James Quillen, Dean of
the Stanford School of Education.
Dean Quillen recently returned
from a three-week tour of the Phil
ippines, where he studied the op
eration of the assistance program
between Stanford and the University
of the Philippines. Also on the tour
were Hugh H. Skilling, Associate
Dean of Engineering, and Paul R.
Hanna, Professor of Education and
co-ordinator of the Stanford-Uni
versity of the Philippines contract.
Dean Quillen listed two main ob
jectives of the assistance program:
"First, to strengthen the gradu
ate program at the University of the
Philippines so they can train their
own educational leaders; and
"Second, to bring the faculty of
the University of the Philippines in
closer contact with the department
of education in the government and
the school superintendents in the
field."
He added that he was well satis
lied with the progress the program
has made toward these goals.
