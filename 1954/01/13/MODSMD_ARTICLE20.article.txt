# Dulles Says U.S., Allies Need 'Massive' Power
## Change in Defense Strategy Indicated by Administration 
### 
NEW YORK, lan. 12 (UP) Secretary of State John Foster Dulles
said tonight the United States and its allies must develop "mas
sive" power to strike back instantly at an aggressoor "by means
and at places of our own choosing."
While Dulles did not say so, his statement added up to a blunt

warning to Russia and Red China
that renewed aggression in Korea or
elsewhere might bring armed retali
ation against the aggressor's home
land — possibly including atomic
bombs.
Outlining newly-created admin
istration policies "for the long
term defense of freedom," Dulles
said the former concept of con
taining communism country-by
country is not enough in today's
world.
"Local defenses must be rein
forced by the further deterrent of
massive retaliatory power," he told
the New York Council on Foreign
Relations. "A potential aggressor
must know that he cannot always
prescribe the battle conditions that
suit him.
"The way to deter aggression is
for the free community to be willing
and able to respond vigorously <
places and with means of its own
choosing."
Dulles said the Eisenhower ad
ministration already had reached a
basic decision to overhaul its de
fense strategy "to get and share
the most basic security at the least
cost" with its allies.
He said the former policy of try
ing to meet aggression locally could
not be continued "without grave
budgetary economic and social con-
I sequences" at home and abroad.
"The basic decision was to depend
primarily upon a great capacity to
I retaliate instantly by means and at,
places of our choosing" Dulles said.
This is in line with the admini
stration's decision to reduce U.S.
ground forces and rely more on
atomic and other new weapons,
coupled with highly-mobile naval,
air, and amphibious units, to deter
Red attack.
Dulles' address also brought into
the open an important modification
of the former Truman administra
tion's policy of containing commu
nism by massing men and supplies
at the point of threatened attack
such as was done in Greece.
Dulles said the way to make col
lective security "more effective, less
costly" is to place more reliance on
the threat of retaliation and less on
local defensive power.
"This is accepted practice so far
as local communities arc con
cerned," Dulles said. "We keep
locks on our doors; but we do not
have an armed guard in every
home.
"We rely principally on a com
munity security system so well
equipped to punish any who break,
in and steal that, in fact, would-bc
aggressors arc generally deterred.
That is the modern way of getting
maximum protection at a bearable
cost.
"What the Eisenhower administra
tion seeks is a similar international
■ security system."
Dulles said the administration
believes its policy is the best way
to meet Soviet Communist plan
ning for "an entire historical ora."
He said it is essential to meet the
Communist threat without ex
hausting ourselves.
In addition to building massive re
taliatory strength, Dulles said the
free world must maintain solid econ
omies and show all men "how good
r can be the fruits of freedom."

NEW YORK, lan. 12 (UP) Secretary of State John Foster Dulles
said tonight the United States and its allies must develop "mas
sive" power to strike back instantly at an aggressoor "by means
and at places of our own choosing."
While Dulles did not say so, his statement added up to a blunt

warning to Russia and Red China
that renewed aggression in Korea or
elsewhere might bring armed retali
ation against the aggressor's home
land — possibly including atomic
bombs.
Outlining newly-created admin
istration policies "for the long
term defense of freedom," Dulles
said the former concept of con
taining communism country-by
country is not enough in today's
world.
"Local defenses must be rein
forced by the further deterrent of
massive retaliatory power," he told
the New York Council on Foreign
Relations. "A potential aggressor
must know that he cannot always
prescribe the battle conditions that
suit him.
"The way to deter aggression is
for the free community to be willing
and able to respond vigorously <
places and with means of its own
choosing."
Dulles said the Eisenhower ad
ministration already had reached a
basic decision to overhaul its de
fense strategy "to get and share
the most basic security at the least
cost" with its allies.
He said the former policy of try
ing to meet aggression locally could
not be continued "without grave
budgetary economic and social con-
I sequences" at home and abroad.
"The basic decision was to depend
primarily upon a great capacity to
I retaliate instantly by means and at,
places of our choosing" Dulles said.
This is in line with the admini
stration's decision to reduce U.S.
ground forces and rely more on
atomic and other new weapons,
coupled with highly-mobile naval,
air, and amphibious units, to deter
Red attack.
Dulles' address also brought into
the open an important modification
of the former Truman administra
tion's policy of containing commu
nism by massing men and supplies
at the point of threatened attack
such as was done in Greece.
Dulles said the way to make col
lective security "more effective, less
costly" is to place more reliance on
the threat of retaliation and less on
local defensive power.
"This is accepted practice so far
as local communities arc con
cerned," Dulles said. "We keep
locks on our doors; but we do not
have an armed guard in every
home.
"We rely principally on a com
munity security system so well
equipped to punish any who break,
in and steal that, in fact, would-bc
aggressors arc generally deterred.
That is the modern way of getting
maximum protection at a bearable
cost.
"What the Eisenhower administra
tion seeks is a similar international
■ security system."
Dulles said the administration
believes its policy is the best way
to meet Soviet Communist plan
ning for "an entire historical ora."
He said it is essential to meet the
Communist threat without ex
hausting ourselves.
In addition to building massive re
taliatory strength, Dulles said the
free world must maintain solid econ
omies and show all men "how good
r can be the fruits of freedom."
