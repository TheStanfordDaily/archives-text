# A 						Year of Action
## 
### 
All last year we waited for our new President
to come forward with a legislative program.
And all last year we were told, "Mr. Eisen
hower and his advisers are studying the situa
tion. They'll be ready with a program next
year."
"Next year" is here nt>w. Last Friday morn
ing Mr. Eisenhower finally told us what he
wants the country to do this year.
His Report to the Nation was far from com
plete. It was extremely vague in spots,
tint, v/herever he was specific, his sugges
tions touched off an immedijte tlare-up of
controversy in the Congress and the coun
try.
Even as Mr. Eisenhower was speaking, you
could tell from the noticeable lack of applause
at key times that Congress isn't goinq to accept
all of his ideas as gospel.
Then, Monday morning, the President
Outlined specific plans for lowering farm
price supports and revising the Taft-Hartley
law. And the resulting furor made it still
clearer that the people's hero is not neces
sarily Congress's.
Tomorrow Mr. Eisenhower is going to send
Congress a message calling for expansion of
social security. Next Monday he's going to
present his health protection plan. And he's
premised messages all through this month,
er h one of which will touch off still more de
bate.
Just to name a few of Mr. Eisenhower's pro
grams that some members of Congress appar
ently aren't going to like:
A public housing program.
Anti-recession measures.
A more free foreign trade policy.
A new public lands policy.
Maintaining corporation and excise taxes
now due to be cut on March 1.

Lowering the troop force in Korea.
Sharing tactical knowledge about atomic
weapons with our Allies.
Legalizing wire-tapping.
Congress now is narrowly divided. In the
Senate there are 48 Democrats, 47 Republi
cans. and one independent, Wayne Morse.
The lineup in the House is 219 Republicans,
215 Democrats, and one independent. And
if you leave parties out of it, "liberals" and
"conservatives" still seem about numerically
egual.
Actually, though, we're going to find that a
simple two-way split is unusual. In debates
like those on anti-Communist laws or Taft Hart
ley revisions, we'll see some Congressmen bit
terly demanding measures far to the right of
those sought by Mr, Eisenhower. And we'll
find others denouncing the President's pro
gram as reactionary.
In short Mr. Eisenhower's message last Fri
day morning began ten thousand debates, each
and every one of which will grow more heated
before it is settled.
It's a complex situation. The line-up will
probably be different on every issue. Every
Congressman's vote, every committee deci
sion, every administration statement may
prove vital.
For us knowing what is going on is going
to prove a problem. For once we can't just
cheer or boo from the sidelines as Republi
cans or Democrats. Party stands are so
mixed up that we'll have to make our own
decisions about where we stand on each
issue.
But luckily this time we're in on the begin
ning, the very beginning, of this make-or-break
year. For at least this chapter in the story of
our lives we can begin on the first page.

weapons with our Allies.
Legalizing wire-tapping.
Congress now is narrowly divided. In the
Senate there are 48 Democrats, 47 Republi
cans. and one independent, Wayne Morse.
The lineup in the House is 219 Republicans,
215 Democrats, and one independent. And
if you leave parties out of it, "liberals" and
"conservatives" still seem about numerically
egual.
Actually, though, we're going to find that a
simple two-way split is unusual. In debates
like those on anti-Communist laws or Taft Hart
ley revisions, we'll see some Congressmen bit
terly demanding measures far to the right of
those sought by Mr, Eisenhower. And we'll
find others denouncing the President's pro
gram as reactionary.
In short Mr. Eisenhower's message last Fri
day morning began ten thousand debates, each
and every one of which will grow more heated
before it is settled.
It's a complex situation. The line-up will
probably be different on every issue. Every
Congressman's vote, every committee deci
sion, every administration statement may
prove vital.
For us knowing what is going on is going
to prove a problem. For once we can't just
cheer or boo from the sidelines as Republi
cans or Democrats. Party stands are so
mixed up that we'll have to make our own
decisions about where we stand on each
issue.
But luckily this time we're in on the begin
ning, the very beginning, of this make-or-break
year. For at least this chapter in the story of
our lives we can begin on the first page.

All last year we waited for our new President
to come forward with a legislative program.
And all last year we were told, "Mr. Eisen
hower and his advisers are studying the situa
tion. They'll be ready with a program next
year."
"Next year" is here nt>w. Last Friday morn
ing Mr. Eisenhower finally told us what he
wants the country to do this year.
His Report to the Nation was far from com
plete. It was extremely vague in spots,
tint, v/herever he was specific, his sugges
tions touched off an immedijte tlare-up of
controversy in the Congress and the coun
try.
Even as Mr. Eisenhower was speaking, you
could tell from the noticeable lack of applause
at key times that Congress isn't goinq to accept
all of his ideas as gospel.
Then, Monday morning, the President
Outlined specific plans for lowering farm
price supports and revising the Taft-Hartley
law. And the resulting furor made it still
clearer that the people's hero is not neces
sarily Congress's.
Tomorrow Mr. Eisenhower is going to send
Congress a message calling for expansion of
social security. Next Monday he's going to
present his health protection plan. And he's
premised messages all through this month,
er h one of which will touch off still more de
bate.
Just to name a few of Mr. Eisenhower's pro
grams that some members of Congress appar
ently aren't going to like:
A public housing program.
Anti-recession measures.
A more free foreign trade policy.
A new public lands policy.
Maintaining corporation and excise taxes
now due to be cut on March 1.

Lowering the troop force in Korea.
Sharing tactical knowledge about atomic
weapons with our Allies.
Legalizing wire-tapping.
