# BULL SESSION

### VIC PALMIERI 
Vic Palmieri, former Daily Bull Sessioner and
Sigma Chi house president, graduated in June, 1951,
and iii now in the Stanford Law School. Palmieri's
remarks below on rushing which appeared in The
Daily in 1951 bear reprinting.—Ed.)
I've got something to say today, which is probably
.surprising, but I dont know quite how to say it—

which probably isn't surprising.
All I know is that somebody's
got to let some air out of this
big balloon called rushing.
Encina's more confused than
;i Chinese fire drill right now,
with Row men stalking freshmen
in the halls with all the gentle
ness of a Shanghai press-gang.
And with nil the excitement
and the pressure and the mystic

aura of fraternities there's a heavy atmosphere in
the old dorm—enough to send a lot of freshman
hearts wondering.
Nobody cared about the kids whom rushing has
convinced that they're the greatest guys in the
world and objects of much well-deserved attention.
They'll learn the why wherefore eventually.
When it's all over, their values will straighten out
fast.
But there are a lot of others living in Encina
whom rushing has convinced differently, and who
won't recover so fast. They're the kids who have to

answer the phone and open the door every five
minutes to tell the fraternity men that their room
mate isn't in, and no, sorry, he probably won't be
back before morning with all the rushing dates he's
got.
They're the guys to care about. They are the
ones I want to talk to and say, "Look, fella, wise
up. Right now it seems like the most important
thing in the world. It isn't, believe me. At Stan
ford especially, you don't have to worry. If you
really want to be in a fraternity and aren't just
caught up in the social myth—if you want frater
nity life with all its special advantages and dis
advantages—then your chances are just as good
as ever, better even, when formal rushing is over,
and you become acquainted with fraternity men
through regular campus life."
Otherwise, there are so many men at Stanford who
have chosen a full, happy, satisfying way of life
outside of fraternities that you can't miss. There
was a time when most of the big athletes and ball
players were all in the eating clubs, rather than on
the Row. i
The point is, guy, don't he fooled. It's a big bal
loon right now, and the time will come when you'll
recognize it for just that. But meanwhile, if you
let it get at your pride or your self respect, take
it from me—you just aren't bright.
Someday soon, that balloon's going to burst—let's
drink to the day, how about it?

world and objects of much well-deserved attention.
They'll learn the why wherefore eventually.
When it's all over, their values will straighten out
fast.
But there are a lot of others living in Encina
whom rushing has convinced differently, and who
won't recover so fast. They're the kids who have to

answer the phone and open the door every five
minutes to tell the fraternity men that their room
mate isn't in, and no, sorry, he probably won't be
back before morning with all the rushing dates he's
got.
They're the guys to care about. They are the
ones I want to talk to and say, "Look, fella, wise
up. Right now it seems like the most important
thing in the world. It isn't, believe me. At Stan
ford especially, you don't have to worry. If you
really want to be in a fraternity and aren't just
caught up in the social myth—if you want frater
nity life with all its special advantages and dis
advantages—then your chances are just as good
as ever, better even, when formal rushing is over,
and you become acquainted with fraternity men
through regular campus life."
Otherwise, there are so many men at Stanford who
have chosen a full, happy, satisfying way of life
outside of fraternities that you can't miss. There
was a time when most of the big athletes and ball
players were all in the eating clubs, rather than on
the Row. i
The point is, guy, don't he fooled. It's a big bal
loon right now, and the time will come when you'll
recognize it for just that. But meanwhile, if you
let it get at your pride or your self respect, take
it from me—you just aren't bright.
Someday soon, that balloon's going to burst—let's
drink to the day, how about it?

Vic Palmieri, former Daily Bull Sessioner and
Sigma Chi house president, graduated in June, 1951,
and iii now in the Stanford Law School. Palmieri's
remarks below on rushing which appeared in The
Daily in 1951 bear reprinting.—Ed.)
I've got something to say today, which is probably
.surprising, but I dont know quite how to say it—

which probably isn't surprising.
All I know is that somebody's
got to let some air out of this
big balloon called rushing.
Encina's more confused than
;i Chinese fire drill right now,
with Row men stalking freshmen
in the halls with all the gentle
ness of a Shanghai press-gang.
And with nil the excitement
and the pressure and the mystic

aura of fraternities there's a heavy atmosphere in
the old dorm—enough to send a lot of freshman
hearts wondering.
Nobody cared about the kids whom rushing has
convinced that they're the greatest guys in the
world and objects of much well-deserved attention.
They'll learn the why wherefore eventually.

fast.
