The number of Stanford students
in the Palo Alto Hospital yesterday
morning totaled 13 â€”an unusually
large number from the University,
according to Dr. George Houck, Di
rector of Health Service at Stan
ford. Of the 13, over half of the
students were entered as a result of
injuries.
There has been a sin ft in the last
five or six years toward more hospi
talization from injuries and less
from illness, according to Dr.
Houck.
During the winter months, the
blame for most accidental injuries
can usually be shared equally by
auto and ski mishaps. Because of
the comparative lack of snow on the
slopes this year, ski injuries are not
now among the major causes of
j hospitalization.
Three of the 13 students received
injuries from automobile accidents,
two are entered as a result of ill
ness, and trte remaining eight are
entered for elective orthopedic sur
gery.
