# Hard Work, Tea Leaves Built Women's Clubhouse
## 
### JAE HUNLEY 
The Women's Clubhouse is a
good example of the old maxim
"never underestimate the power
of a woman." Had it not been
for an energetic group of Stan
ford women, a committee would
not have been formed to raise
funds to build a Women's Club
house.
Prices were much cheaper then,
but it required a tremendous effort
to raise the $2,000 necessary to begin
the project. The Clubhouse was
practically built on tea leaves be
cause money derived from afternoon
teas provided much of the funds.
The rest was raised through dona
tions and by other Stanford women's
organizations. Nowadays, the Club
house funds come from renting
rooms to various organizations. Also,
each coed indirectly contributes $1
when she pays her registration fees.
Tlie Clubhouse was finished and
dedicated in February 1915. The
cost of the building and its fur
nishings were listed at that time
as $17,000. Since then, there have
been many additions and the
amount has risen considerably. In
1927, Helen Cubberley said that
the cost was $44,073.94.
At the head or the Clubhouse is
tiie Stanford Women's Clubhouse
Board. This group formulates poli
cies and acts upon them. Among the
board members are: representatives
from Cap and Gown, the Graduate
Women's Association, the Office of
the Dean of Women, Faculty Wom

en's Club, Women's Row Residences,
and the Women's Halls.
Assisting this board is an execu
tive committee which aLso acts upon
policies*, but the person who keeps
things going smoothly is the hostess.
There have been three since the
opening of the Clubhouse—the pres
ent one is Mrs. Dorothy Tibby.
Mrs. Tibby co-ordinates the
groups which meet there, seeing
(hat no two groups are scheduled
for the same room at the same
time. She also assists in arrange
ments for groups. She is on duty
every day except Sunday and
often works long hours so that
the Clubhouse will be available
when needed.
One of the facilities offered by the
Clubhouse is the Guest Room. This
is available by reservation to any
one connected with Stanford. The
Clubhouse also has several lounges
and equipped kitchens. These are
usually free of charge to students.
Occasionally small fees are charged.
To use any of the facilities, reser
vations must be made before with
the hostess, Mrs. Tibby. This is be
cause it is used by the Mother's
Club, several religious organizations,

and the off-campus women. On the
third floor, the YWCA has its of
fices and this year, AWS has moved
its offices into the Clubhouse.
The Clubhouse has no definite fu
ture plans at present. It has ex
panded about as far as it can within
the house itself. The directors hope,
with their available facilities, they
can meet the .needs of the many
campus organizations which wish to
use the Clubhouse.


F'OR EVERY STANFORD WOMAN—Freshman coed Mary Dunham walks down the steps of
the Women's Clubhouse. Built largely through the efforts of the women themselves, the club
house cost nearly $45,000 and is currently supported by rental funds and fees paid as part of
coed registration in the University. Clubhouse policies are formulated by the Stanford Women's
Clubhouse Board, which includes representatives of women's groups all over campus.
