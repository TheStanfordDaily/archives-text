# Boxers, Wrestlers Battle California
## 
### DICK KOENIGSBERGER LEE HANSEN 
The Stanford boxing team
opens its season tonight against
California at Berkeley, and ac
cording'to a California publicity
release "the Indians should be
favored for the first time in sev
eral years."
However, the California release
was published before Stanford's
stellar 167 - pounder, Tony Wynn,
was lost to Coach Ray Lunny and
the squad for the rest of the season,
because of a broken jaw.
The injury to Wynn leaves the
match a toss-up. Doug Stocks will
replace the clasÂ»y Tony.
There are several good bouts on
tap for tonight, tops of which may
be the heavyweight struggle be
tween Cal's PCC runner-up Dick
King and Stanford's Bob Birkie.
Another good bout will pit the
Indians' Eric Hansen, rated by
Lunny as a PCC championship
threat, against the Bears' Gene
Markley.
Jack Owens, Stanford's California
Intercollegiate 145 - pound finalist,
takes on Gary Fullbright.
At 139 pounds, Fred Dittmer of
Stanford meets Cal's Dick Lohn
dahl, runner-up in the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiates.
The Indians may have to forfeit
the 125- and 177-pound bouts. At
this writing, Coach Lunny has found
no replacements in these weight di
visions.

STANFORD CAL
Gary Sievert 132 A. Galhreath
Fred Dittmer 13!) Dick Londahl
Jack Owens 147 G. Fullbright
Eric Hansen 156 G. Markley

With one match already won,
the Stanford wrestling team
meets an unbeaten Cal team at
8 tonight when the Bears host
the Indians in their Berkeley
gym.
Victorious over the Alameda Na
val Air Station 23-8 last Friday,
the Red and White team will meet
a much tougher outfit in the Bears
who smashed their last opponents.
San Jose State, 22-10,
Stanford boasts such outstanding
men as Olie Lyons 130-pound divi
sion, and captain-elect George Rus
sell, 138-pound division. California
can match them with two of their
best grapplers, Ben Fraticelli and
Dave Kikuchi, 130 pounds and 138
pounds respectively.
Also worthy of note is the In
dians' Bob Fisher, who opened
last Friday's meet by pinning his
opponent in the second period.
He will lie pitted aaginst Cal's
123 - pound Isao Fujimoto, who
will start for the .first time this
season.
The Stanford lineup will be the
same that whipped Alameda Naval
Air Station. Cal has two replace
ments: Isao Fujimoto, a returning
letter-winner who will'replace Tom
Kikuchi at 123 pounds, and novice
Robert Hill, who will replace in
jured Dick Taylor at 167 pounds.
