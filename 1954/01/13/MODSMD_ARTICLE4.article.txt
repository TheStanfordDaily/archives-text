# Wolverton Hits A.M.A.

### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 (UP) â€”
Chairman Charles A. Wolverton of
the House Commerce Committee
sharply criticized the American
Medical Association today for con
demning health programs as "so
cialized medicine" without present
ing a plan of its own.
He angrily declared that "wc
have a right to expect that criticism
should he constructive and helpful
... I fail to find any solution that
is offered by the A.M.A."
Wolverton (Ft., N.J.) made his
spirited 10-minute speech during a
committee hearing on health insur
ance plans. When he finished, he
said, "I think maybe I've said too
much, but my remarks came from
my heart and arc sincere."
Dr. Paul B. Magnuson, who head
ed former President Truman's Com
mission on the Nation's Health, rec
ommended a federal law to re-in
sure the benefits of non - profit
health insurance groups.
Magnuson said a government
guarantee to privately financed
medical and hospital insurance
plans would give a "needed shot in
the arm" to moves to expand cover
age. But he said the government
should insist on outlawing "the fine
print which many chiselers put into
present-day policies."
Magnuson said the average fam
ily particularly needs protection
against larger and "catastrophic"
medical bills. He said present poli
cies often concentrate too much on
protection against $5 and $10 medi
cal bills.
Wolverton's outburst against the
A.M.A. came during the testimony
by Dr. H. Clifford Loos, who oper
ates a medical and hospital plan
with 117,000 members in Los Ange
les. Loos said the A.M.A. opposed
his plan because it limits members
to the services of 118 participating
physicians.
Wolverton banged his fist on the
table and said, "I hope the day will
come when the A.M.A. will recog
nize the problem and challenge it
by coming to Congress with a so
lution."
