# Students Plan Video Series
## 
### 
A 13-week television series is be
ing planned by students of the
Speech and Drama Department, un
der the direction of Associate Pro
fessor Stanley Donner.
The series, which is tentatively
scheduled to be televised over sta
tion KQED, East Bay educational
station, will be entitled "Your
Rugged Constitution" and will de
scribe the history and intent of the
United States Constitution.
Like last year's prize-winning se
ries on world affairs, "People,
Places, and Politics," the prospec
tive telecasts will be primarily
dramatized lectures, with leading
members of the Political Science
Department and the Law School
expected to take part, as well as
students from Donner's classes.
The scries is expected to go on the
air sometime later this quarter. The
American Association of Educa
tional Broadcasters granted Donner
and his class $8,000 earlier this year
to develop such a series.
