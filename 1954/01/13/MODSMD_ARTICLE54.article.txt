# Students Take Holiday Trip
## 
### 
The Christmas holidays for 46
Stanford students from 21 different
foreign countries this year included
a 10-day trip through Los Angeles,
Palm Springs, Grand Canyon, Las
Vegas, and Death Valley.
Equipped with sleeping bags,
flashlights, and clothing for the
warmth of Palm Springs and the
cold of the Grand Canyon area, the
students left here on Dec. 2G and
arrived at Death Valley on Jan. 2.
According to Werner Warmbrunn,
foreign student adviser, this was the
second such trip for foreign stu
dents. He indicated that plans for a
similar trip during spring vacation
are being formed.
Students participating in these
excursions, he said, "now have
something to talk about." He added
that American students arc also en
couraged to participate.
Additional information about pro
posed trips can be obtained from
Warmbrunn in Inner Quad Room
102-G.
