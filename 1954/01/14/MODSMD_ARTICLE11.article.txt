### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
The financial situation at Stan
ford was explained last night by
Dr. Douglas M. Whitaker, Uni
versity Provost, to a group of
Stanford Village graduate stu
dents in a Stanford—Today and
Tomorrow talk.
Discussing the recent increase in
tuition, Whitaker explained that the
University was fast running through
its reserves, and had, in 1953, run
up a $700,000 deficit.' Under the
terms of the charter that founded
Stanford, the University is not per
mitted to borrow funds.
Since, according to Whitaker,
Stanford does not. want to be known
as a "rich man's institution," ap
proximately one-sixth of the added
income will go toward fellowships
and tuition scholarships.
At the time of its founding,
Stanford was a "wealthy institu
tion. having a $21 million endow
ment in stocks and bonds, he
said. This income, however, suf
fered during (he inflation and,
although the endowment now
totals $45 million, in view of the
decrease in the value of money,
the University has not held its
own.
Until 1916, Stanford charged no
tuition fee. The initial fee charged
was only $15 a semester (Stanford
was then on the' two-semester sys
tem), and increases have come
throughout the years as needed.
At the present time, the Provost
continued, the major part of the
University income comes from tui
tion, which totals $4.(i million a
year.
Another source of future in
come, according to Whitaker, is
Stanford's lands. The most im
portant project now is Lot One,
between the Palo Alto Hospital
and San Francisquito Creek,
which is being planned for a busi
ness district, with several large
stores like the Emporium renting
ground.
• Residential districts are also in
the planning stage.
Of more direct interest to stu
dents, Whitaker said, officials of
the University been thinking
about building more dormitories so
as to get more undergraduates out
of the Village and onto the campus
and be able to admit more women
to the University.
