## Eisenhower Defends Farm, Labor, Military Program 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 (UP)â€”President Eisenhower yesterday
defended his farm program against congressional criticism and
left it to Congress to decide whether government-conducted strike
votes should be held before or after a strike starts.
The President refused to budge from his call for flexible farm

price supports despite some GOP'
charges that it is "not politically
feasible in an election year." He said
he believes the program is right,
necessary and will lead to a stable,
prosperous agriculture.
With some feeling, he rejected
an implication that he had asked
Congress for a lot more than he
actually expected to get. He told a
questioner that he docs not make
declarations to Congress just to
look good.
Most of the President's news con
ference was devoted to a discussion
of the sweeping legislative program
he outlined in his State of the Union
message. Mr. Eisenhower covered a
a wide range of issues:
He said he would be happy to ac
cept. changes in the original admin
istration substitute for the so-called
Bricker Amendment to limit the
President's treaty-making powers.
He declined to say whether he
would veto a bill to continue farm
price supports at 00 per cent of
parity. Mr. Eisenhower noted that
a president cannot veto a specific
item in a measure and sometimes
provisions which should be vetoed
have to be aproved to achieve the
gain of the overall legislation.
He said the "new look" in military
strategy as outlined by Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles in a New
York speech Tuesday night is aimed
at giving this natiop. the clement of
surprise if it has to resort to force.
Dulles said the United States would
meet any aggression "by means and
at places of our choosing."
Mr. Eisenhower said it is encour
aging that Dulles and Soviet Am
bassador Gcorgi N. Zarubin have
met here to discuss the President's
atoms-for-peace plan. But he added
that he could not say whether this
proves the Russians have approached
the plan with an attitude of good
faith.
