# V.A. May Build Hospital Here
## 
### 
The possible selection of Stanford
land as a site for a new $23 million
hospital to be built by the Veterans
Administration was being speculat
ed upon by members of the Califor
nia Congressional delegation in
Washington, D.C., according to a
report in a San Jose paper yester
day.
The V.A. refused comment on the
speculation, and said that an an
nouncement of a site location for
the proposed neuro-psychiatric hos
pital to treat 1,000 patients probably
will not be made for another month.
Two prospective locations, one
in Santa Clara County, the other
in Santa Cruz County, have been
turned down by the V.A., it was
disclosed earlier this week.
Some sourcess in Washington
have interpreted the wording of the
refusals to mean that the Stanford
campus site is being favored.
The V.A. originally planned the
hospital for San Francisco, but that
city's proximity to atomic targets
necessitated the search for a new
location.
Late last year, the V.A. inspected
the Stanford site near the new
Eastman Kodak plant and the Shar
on Estate west of Menlo Park.
However, residents of the area in
formed Rev. J. Arthur Younger (R.,
San Mateo) they were against hav
ing the hospital built near them.
Younger said it was unlikely
the X.fy. would purchase high
priced residential property such
as (lie famed Sharon Estate, which
as the famed Sharon Estate,
which last year was the scene of
a $5,000 fire.
If the new hospital is built in this
area it will be the second such
project near the Palo Alto scene.
The V.A. operates a mental hospital
near here now.
In a letter to a real estate firm,
the V.A. said it had no site selection
for the hospital on the West Coast
"at this time."
