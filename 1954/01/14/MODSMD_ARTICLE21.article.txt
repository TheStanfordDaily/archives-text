## 
### BOB REZAK 
The University of California's
Non - Academic Employees of
the University, meeting in Ber
keley yesterday, declared that
the case of Harold Winkler, UC
assistant professor of political
science, involves an attempt to
curtail freedom of speech in
this crucial issue."
Between 80 and 90 members of
the group, composed of research as
sistants, graduate students, and
teaching assistants at the university,
drafted a resolution condemning the
university's investigation of a
speech the professor made at an
off-campus meeting.
And the group added that it con
sidered the issue "dangerous and
disturbing."
The Daily Californian report of
Professor Winkler's off - campus
speech on "Liberalism" was read
at a meetivig of the University's
Board of Regents recently and
the hoard asked that the speech
he investigated.
Winkler has chargcd he was mis
quoted by the publication.
Before the quote controversy
arose, university officials decided to
release Winkler because he had not
published .any findings of a signifi
cant nature.
The non - academic employee*'
group said in its resolution, which in
being circulated on the Berkeley
campus, that "the threat upon the
investigation to 'dismiss forthwith
Professor Winkler' for something he
was reported to have said in an off
campus speech is an attempt to cur
tail freedom of speech and this is
the crucial issue."
The resolution further stated, in
part, that "there is the danger im
plicit in the current investigation
that by consenting to investigate
the veracity of the disputed quo
tation, the community will get the
impression that the university is
admitting that speeches may now
be censored in accordance with
the pleasure of the Board of Re
gents or any other group."
The group said it felt it was "im
proper" for the Regents to ask tha
administration to investigate speech
es by faculty members and similarly
improper to dismiss views that arc
displeasing.
The group also called upon mem
bers of the "university community
and the community at large to join
with us in vigorously protesting this
or any similar attack on our basic
freedoms."
The campus chapter of the Amer
ican Association of University Pro
fessors has called a special mem
bership meeting for today to discuss
the Winkler case.
