# Communism... An Issue in '54?
## 
### 
When President Eisenhower recently an
nounced that Communism would not be an is
sue this year, we sincerely hoped he would
prove correct.
B'.'t *hat possibility, it would seem, is fading
fasi. !. now appears that Communism, with all
its emoaonal and half-understood undertones,
is to become an echoing campaign cry.
For it seems that Republican congressmen,
moved by the desperation of their flimsy ma
jority in the House and the Senate, deter
minedly do not intend to give up the demo
gcgic attractiveness of Communism as an issue.
Indications that the President's wish may be
i red and that Communism might be main
t: 2d in the GOP election handbook were
c this week in Congress.
strong indication ot Republican senti
i 23nt on Capital Hill came a v/eek ago when
President Eisenhower delivered his State ot
the Union address. While most Republican
representatives and Senators remained un
moved through much of the lengthy speech,
they rose in wild applause when the Presi
dent promised a harder government program
against Communists.
An even more striking indication of possible
political attitudes current in Washington came
Tuesday with the surprise announcement that
Senator Joseph McCarthy (R., Wis.) had been
appointed by his Republican colleagues to a
seat on the powerful and strategic Senate
Rules Committee.
On that committee, McCarthy, who has re
peatedly challenged the President's desire to
silence the Communist issue, will have a hand
in framing the procedural policies of the Senate

for at least the next year, maybe longer if the j
Repulicans should retain a majority in the com-1
ing elections.
And from that committee McCarthy will
be in a strong position to prod ihe President
and his party with his strident demand that
Communism predominate as the issue of the
day.
The adoption of his demands, we feel, could
prove dangerous to the fundamental tenets of
our Constitutional system, with its respect for
the rational nature of man.
For a campaign based on Communism, we J
feel, would only pander to base, irrational con
siderations and would not accurately inform
voters, as a campaign rightly should, of all the
partisan differences.
It would place ine emphasis on emotional
ism, rather than rationalism, and conseguent
ly would convert'polttics into an arena where
demogogues dominate.
That such would be the possible character
of a campaign based on Communism, has been
indicated by the growing .emphasis by many
Republican politicians on so-called McCarthy
ism, which draws its notoriety from the fact
that it employs such questionable tactics as
guilt by association and the unfounded smear.
We sincerely hope that such vulgar elements
will not be further injected into the political
scene. We hope that the temptation for office
doesn't overweigh honor and respect for our
Constitutional tradition of fair play.
But if Communism does become the super
charged issue of the forthcoming congressional
elections then, we hope, that the voter is alert
to its implication and will refute it as the basis
for a sensible electoral decision.

When President Eisenhower recently an
nounced that Communism would not be an is
sue this year, we sincerely hoped he would
prove correct.
B'.'t *hat possibility, it would seem, is fading
fasi. !. now appears that Communism, with all
its emoaonal and half-understood undertones,
is to become an echoing campaign cry.
For it seems that Republican congressmen,
moved by the desperation of their flimsy ma
jority in the House and the Senate, deter
minedly do not intend to give up the demo
gcgic attractiveness of Communism as an issue.
Indications that the President's wish may be

strong indication ot Republican senti
i 23nt on Capital Hill came a v/eek ago when
President Eisenhower delivered his State ot
the Union address. While most Republican
representatives and Senators remained un
moved through much of the lengthy speech,
they rose in wild applause when the Presi
dent promised a harder government program
against Communists.
An even more striking indication of possible
political attitudes current in Washington came
Tuesday with the surprise announcement that
Senator Joseph McCarthy (R., Wis.) had been
appointed by his Republican colleagues to a
seat on the powerful and strategic Senate
Rules Committee.
On that committee, McCarthy, who has re
peatedly challenged the President's desire to
silence the Communist issue, will have a hand
in framing the procedural policies of the Senate

for at least the next year, maybe longer if the j
Repulicans should retain a majority in the com-1
ing elections.
And from that committee McCarthy will
be in a strong position to prod ihe President
and his party with his strident demand that
Communism predominate as the issue of the
day.
The adoption of his demands, we feel, could
prove dangerous to the fundamental tenets of
our Constitutional system, with its respect for
the rational nature of man.
For a campaign based on Communism, we J
feel, would only pander to base, irrational con
siderations and would not accurately inform
voters, as a campaign rightly should, of all the
partisan differences.
It would place ine emphasis on emotional
ism, rather than rationalism, and conseguent
ly would convert'polttics into an arena where
demogogues dominate.
That such would be the possible character
of a campaign based on Communism, has been
indicated by the growing .emphasis by many
Republican politicians on so-called McCarthy
ism, which draws its notoriety from the fact
that it employs such questionable tactics as
guilt by association and the unfounded smear.
We sincerely hope that such vulgar elements
will not be further injected into the political
scene. We hope that the temptation for office
doesn't overweigh honor and respect for our
Constitutional tradition of fair play.
But if Communism does become the super
charged issue of the forthcoming congressional
elections then, we hope, that the voter is alert
to its implication and will refute it as the basis
for a sensible electoral decision.
