### PETE GROTHE 
TIU'HhDAY GRAB-BAG
Anguished screams greeted the news that the Stan
loid tuition would be raised to $250, effective next fall
quarter. Yet, there was one Stanford student who
drooled with glee at the tuition hike. When this stu-

dent, whom we'll call Howard,
went home for Christmas, he con
fronted his father.
"Lissen, Dad," he lied, "they've
raised the tuition at Stanford to
$250, starting this winter quarter."
His father penned a check for
$250, $30 of which Howard devi
ously pocketed.
Howard, whose cunning far ex
ceeds his principles, is probably

HAZARDS OF RUSHING DEPT. Turner Schley
was one of the Breakers Eating Club's best glad hand
men. As the hordes swarmed through during open
house, Turner made it a point to give each visitor a
firm handshake.
After about the 100 th handshake. Turner's paw
cracked under the strain. But this didn't stop him. He
ran to a med student who was a member of the club,
got the hand bandaged, and rushed back to the line
of fire to shake more hands.
This must prove something, although I don't quite
know what.

PREDICTION DEPT. We don't want to steal any
thunder from Drew Pearson, but we'd like to make a
prediction. (Drew Pearson's predictions are 91 per
cent right 20 per cent of the time.) Here it is:
"Take Care of My Little Girl," a (lick on sorority
life, is scheduled to get the most brutal mutilation, in
Sunday Evening Movie catcall history when it shows
this week.
BARRIER CRUSADE DEPT.. They've got to go.
They've got to go. The barriers at Engineering Corner
are causing more of a traffic hazard than in the pre
barrier days, not to mention the circuitous detours
that campus motorists must take.
Like the bees at the Cellar, like Georgi Malenkov in
the Kremlin, like long lines on reg day, they've got
to go.
FUTURE EVENTS DEPT. Take out your calen
dar and mark the week Feb. 12-1!). That's the week
that England's internationally-famed clergyman
Bryan Green comes to Stanford. Regarded as the
best orator in the Anglican Church (Episcopal and
Church of England), Stanford was exceedingly for
tunate in obtaining his speaking talents for a full
week. lie is so popular that he had to be booked two
years in advance.
lie is the most fantastically-good public speaker
we have ever heard. Be sure to mark that date on
your calendar.
