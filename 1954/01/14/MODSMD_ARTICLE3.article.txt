# Quarry Rock-Slide Traps Boy, 12, for Two Hours
## 
### 
Twelve-year-old George Peirusich 111 yesterday spent, perhaps,
the longest two hours of his life as he lay pinned by heavy
boulders in the mouth of a shallow cave in the old Page Mill
Quarry, waiting until Stanford and Los Altos firemen could re
lease him.
From about 5:15 p.m. until almost 7:30, the thin, wide-eyed boy

lay quietly as rescuers, working in"
the bright glare of large flood-lights,
propped back the rock that had so
suddenly collapsed about him and
held him fast.
And when the final huge stone
was removed, the lad smiled
weakly at his sweating rescuers as
they placed him on a stretcher
and, with a polite ' nod, said,
"Thanks, thanks very much."
Upon removal he was taken by
ambulance to the Palo Alto Hospital
where attendants said they believed
he had suffered a broken right leg.
The Palo Alto boy's plight was
first reported by two playmates who
had been scrambling the tall, rocky
cliffs of the quarry with him and had
crawled free of the narrow cave
before its roof and walls fell in
without warning.
George had just gotten his head
and shoulders free when the loose
rocks gave way and tumbled about
him.
One of the playmates ran to the
intersection of Page Mill and Foot
hill roads and flagged down Jack
Jordan, of Los Altos, who relayed
the report to a fire station in Menlo
Park which in turn contacted the
Stanford department.
The work of the rescuers was
handicapped by the fact that the
cave in which the boy was trapped
was located, about 75 feet'up a pre
cipitous and crumbly cliff that made
ascent difficult.
The fear that more chunks of rock
would break loose and fall on the
boy, burying him, also slowed oper
ations.
The quarry, which has not been
in use for some years, is on Stanford
property.
