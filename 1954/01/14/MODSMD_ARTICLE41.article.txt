BEAR SURPRISE —Frank Hess, sophomore eager for the Califor
nia basketball team, was a big surprise for the Bears this season.
Coach Nibs Price feared trouble in replacing the Ricksen twins
from last year's varsity. Hess has proved capable so far this
season at playing in one of the guard spots alongside of Bob
Matheny. Stanford faces league - leading Cal at the Pavilion
Friday night, and moves to Berkeley Saturday. All tickets to
both games have been sold. —ASUC photo
