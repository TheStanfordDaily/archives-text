## Shootin' the Breeze

"Go*h, you've got a great team
this year, Nibs!" "Boy, this fellow
Matheny is the greatest basketball
player ever to put on a pair of dirtv

wool socks!" "Gee,
Nibs Price is the
grand old man of
basketball coach
es!" "California's
cage team is pos-
I sibly the best in
i Bear history!"
And so on into
a state of nau
sea. The San
Franc is c o

sportswriters, always 011 the look
out for some pseudo-athlete from
Cal to boom for AH - American,
are at it again.
This time they've picked the Cal
1 basketball team, along with its vet
eran coach Nibs Price, as the tar
gets of this season's newspaper adu
lation.
Not that the Bears aren't a good
club this year. And not that Price,
who will retire at the end of this
year, hasn't always been a good
coach and a credit to the game. But
as usual, the San Francisco papers
are overdoing it.
Hell they could drive 30 miles
down the Peninsula and find at least
one ballplayer as good as Cal's Botj
Matheny. And Stanford can match
anything Cal has in the way of
coaches.
Every once in a while Cal conies
up with a really topnotch athletic
star, like Jack Jensen, Les Rich
ie r, Paul Larson, and Andy
Wolfe. But at least once a season
some good - but - not - great ball
player gets a huge buildup from
the San Francisco papers, only to
fall flat on his face as the season
progresses.
Look over the records. Remember
''All - American" Bob Celeri, the
scatterbrained quarterback from
Berkeley a few years back? Celeri
j was unable to make his way in local
semi-pro ball. Or how about the
Ricksen twins, last year's great cage
| duo? For four years the city papers
; built up the Ricksens, hoping they'd
I get good some day. They never did.
Well, let's stop dealing with past
histories and get down to business.

The business at hand is two bas
ketball games with Price's Cal team
this weekend. The local sporting
sheets have established California
as a finalist in the NCAA tourna
ment already, and while the writers
are kind enough not to come out
and say so, the inferences have been
that the game little kids from Stan
ford better stand out of the way
when the mighty Bear juggernaut
starts to roll.
Hah! We've caught them in an
error! The little Indians aren't go
ing to stand at the sidelines and
watch Matheny, McKeen, and Albo
exhibit their All-Universe basket
ball prowess!
Bobby Burnett is going to send
George Selleck, the great little
competitor, out 011 the courts
against the overrated showboat,
Matheny. (A sidelight here: if
Matheny is All - American, how
come little Carroll Williams of
San Jose State completely out
played him in the Cal - Spartan
game earlier this season?)
Okay now, we've got Selleck, the
best guard on the coast, handling
Matheny. Oley SuzdalefT rates the
edge over Bear Frank Hess off ex
perience. The big question here is
whether Oley will be able to go all
out. If that knee holds up we have
a much better chance of coming out
of the series with at least one win.
The forwards, Don DeLong and
Barry Brown for us and Bob Albo
and Jerry Tamberg for Cal, are
about even, with possibly a slight
edge to the Bears.
The center spot? Well, this
weekend will show us just how
much Russ Lawler has improved.
Big Bob McKeen, last year's con
ference scoring champion, is the
yardstick by which we can meas
ure Lawler's ability. Russ made
USC's Roy Irvin look silly last
week, but McKeen will be the
big test.
So there's the comparison of the
starting fives. Our guards are bet
ter, their forwards are better, and
the centers are about even.
Well, let's not get carried" away,
there're still two games to be played
this weekend. Neither team will win
by just talking about it. Â»
