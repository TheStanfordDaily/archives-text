### JACK BYRNE 

TYPEWRITER, ECONOMY SlZE—'Wilber Bailey sets type on a
512,000-plus linotype. This one machine sets the major part of
the material in each morning's Daily, from "Once Around the
Quad" to President Sterling's latest announcements. In the fore
ground are galleys of type which have been set and are await
ing proof-reading by Daily desk workers.


FINAL SlZlNG—Pressman Len Walker cuts one of the pictures, now mounted on a type-metal
block, to the size that it will appear in the morning Daily. The block is then cut and trimmed
to conform to size specifications. Now that the engravings have been cast, mounted, cut to size,
and trimmed, they are ready to be fitted into the page form by the compositor at the direction
of the night editor.


COLUMN THREE, TOP, PLEASE—Night Editor Ruth Jahnke and
Compositor Paul Kerr go about the business of setting the com
pleted stories into the forms which subseguently find their way
to the presses. In this process of makeup, the pictures, stories,
and headlines that make up The Daily are fitted into their proper
place in the page form. News play and typographical appear
ance are of primary importance in makeup.


GOING TO BED—The pages are all made up now, and Walkei
puts a clamp on the form to prevent its falling apart on the trip
to the press room. Pieces of metal and wood, called "furniture"
in the backshop, have been inserted around the form to insure a
perfect fit. The forms are carried to the press, put in place,
clamps removed, forms locked, and all is in readiness for the
night's press run.


HOT STUFF—Pressman Henry "Hank" Janzen pours molten type metal onto the papier-mache
wire mats, which bring pictures of the world's events to the Daily reader. Mats also supply the
illustrations for advertisements and other pictures. After the mats are cast, they must be
mounted on bases' which bring the total height of the base plus the cast mat to .918 inch, or
"type high." This process must be accurate to insure that all printing surfaces are precisely
the same height when placed in the forms and later in the press. The Bibler cartoon is proc
essed daily by this method.


FINISHED PRODUCT—lanzen adjusts the folder as the first
papers begin to come off the press immediately over his right
shoulder. It is now shortly after midnight. The press run, bar
ring unforeseen emergencies, should be completed by 4 a.m.
The papers are then picked up by the Circulation Department
of The Daily's business staff, and distributed around campus. :

TYPEWRITER, ECONOMY SlZE—'Wilber Bailey sets type on a
512,000-plus linotype. This one machine sets the major part of
the material in each morning's Daily, from "Once Around the
Quad" to President Sterling's latest announcements. In the fore
ground are galleys of type which have been set and are await
ing proof-reading by Daily desk workers.


FINAL SlZlNG—Pressman Len Walker cuts one of the pictures, now mounted on a type-metal
block, to the size that it will appear in the morning Daily. The block is then cut and trimmed
to conform to size specifications. Now that the engravings have been cast, mounted, cut to size,
and trimmed, they are ready to be fitted into the page form by the compositor at the direction
of the night editor.


COLUMN THREE, TOP, PLEASE—Night Editor Ruth Jahnke and
Compositor Paul Kerr go about the business of setting the com
pleted stories into the forms which subseguently find their way
to the presses. In this process of makeup, the pictures, stories,
and headlines that make up The Daily are fitted into their proper
place in the page form. News play and typographical appear
ance are of primary importance in makeup.


GOING TO BED—The pages are all made up now, and Walkei
puts a clamp on the form to prevent its falling apart on the trip
to the press room. Pieces of metal and wood, called "furniture"
in the backshop, have been inserted around the form to insure a
perfect fit. The forms are carried to the press, put in place,
clamps removed, forms locked, and all is in readiness for the
night's press run.


HOT STUFF—Pressman Henry "Hank" Janzen pours molten type metal onto the papier-mache
wire mats, which bring pictures of the world's events to the Daily reader. Mats also supply the
illustrations for advertisements and other pictures. After the mats are cast, they must be
mounted on bases' which bring the total height of the base plus the cast mat to .918 inch, or
"type high." This process must be accurate to insure that all printing surfaces are precisely
the same height when placed in the forms and later in the press. The Bibler cartoon is proc
essed daily by this method.


FINISHED PRODUCT—lanzen adjusts the folder as the first
papers begin to come off the press immediately over his right
shoulder. It is now shortly after midnight. The press run, bar
ring unforeseen emergencies, should be completed by 4 a.m.
The papers are then picked up by the Circulation Department
of The Daily's business staff, and distributed around campus. :
