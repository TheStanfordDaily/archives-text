## 'Revolution Is Due to Youth' 
### HELEN DEWAR 
The political revolution of 11)49 i
which set Indonesia free lrom Dutch
control and the social revolution now
just beginning are both a product
of the awakening of youth, declared
Boyd R. Compton, a member of the
American Universities Field Staff,
in his speech yesterday on "Young
Leaders in New Indonesia."
Compton, a graduate of Princeton
University and authority on Fat-
Eastern affairs, spent seven months
at the University of Indonesia ob
serving the youth of this new coun
try, an easy prpy to communism.
The Western influence, especially
that of the United States, is clearly
reflected in the society of the more
He found (hat Indonesian students
were rabid jittcrbuggcrs and "hot"
record fans.
Indonesians are strongly affected
by movies, which are very popular
as a means of education and enter
tainment among the people. High
school students, he said, often at
tend movies as often as once a day.
Unfortunately, though, American
movies have fostered a moral crisis
in encouraging the people to live be
yond their means. * '
Oddly enough, it is among these
more highly educated, more West
ernized people that one finds the
greatest extent of anti-Western feel
ing and strong nationalist sentiment.
It is among the less educated and
poorer classes that an American
visitor receives the greatest welcome,
he said.
"Education is the index of pres
tige in Indonesian society." The
standards of education arc high
and universities are comparable to
those of the United States, Comp
ton commented. Universal educa
tion is the ultimate goal, the num
ber of students having increased
greatly over that of the period of
Dutch control.
Compton referred to university
students as "the lost generation."
Most of these student* have lost
four or five years fighting in the
revolution and are subject to the
emotional strain of revolutionary
ideas. He looks to the high school
generation as one of the high hopes
of Indonesia.
Compton is the first in a series of
AUFS speakers who will discuss
key foreign areas at Stanford.
