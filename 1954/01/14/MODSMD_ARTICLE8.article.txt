# CODE SOLUTION OFFERED
## Report: Let Majors Decide Exam Policy 
### BOB REZAK Associate Editor, The Daily 
A special committee studying clarification of the Honor Code
proposed to. the Executive Committee last night a plan to solve
the drawn-out problem of whether or not students should be
allowed to take examinations out of the classroom.
Excom approved the committee's report, but postponed a vote

on the committee's proposed plan"*
until Excom members had time to
study it further. The issue probably
will come up for a vite at next
week's Excom meeting.
The nine - member committee,
headed by Dave Carr, suggested
that since the taking of examina
tions seemed to be an individual
department problem, the decision
on whether or not students should
be allowed to take examinations
out of the classroom should come
from the individual departments.
The decisions would come as a
result of departmental meetings
with major students in each depart
ment, the committee explained.
The plan provides that:
1. A major student in each de
partment would he selected to
confer with the head of his ma
jor department on adopting a de
partment policy relating to the
examination question.
2. The major student and the
department head would then con
fer and plan a meeting of all fac
ulty members within the depart
ment where a policy would again
he discussed.
3. Next all students within the
major department would he con
tacted and asked to attend a
meeting of their respective de
partments where a proposed de
partmental policy would he pre
sented for final discussion and
approval.
If this plan is approved, it could
be likely that various University
dopartjnents would have different
policies on the taking of examina
tions, but once such policies arc
approved, students would be ex
pected to abide by them.
The w.holc problem concerning
the taking of examinations out of
the classsroom came to a head last
summer when Dean of Students
H. Donald Winbigler reported that
within the past year some profes
sors have expressed concern that
increasing numbers of students
were taking examinations out of
class.
The problem again came up for
consideration of Excom last quar
ter and that body appointed the
nine - member committee, com
posed of students and faculty
members, to survey the problem
and report its findings to Excom
at a later date.
The committee is composed of the
following members: David Carr,
Nancy Nicholson, and James Mitch
ell from Excom; Bill Dickinson, for
mer member of Men's Council; Car
ol Folsom, former member of Wom
en's Council; Norm Lenzer, Funda
mental Standard Committee; Skip
Smith, Student - Faculty Education
Committee; and Dr. George H.
Knolcs and Dr. Clifford F. Wcigle
from the faculty. ,
Carr said his committee inter
viewed 21 University department
heads during the last quarter and
that the general feeling was that a
problem did exist and that a clear
cut ruling should be made.
Some faculty members reported
that no problem of any extent ex
isted in their departments.
Carr said his committee found"
that taking exams out of class be
gan to grow from about 1945 to the
point where it has nqw become a
tradition.

allowed to take examinations out of the classroom.
Excom approved the committee's report, but postponed a vote

on the committee's proposed plan"*
until Excom members had time to
study it further. The issue probably
will come up for a vite at next
week's Excom meeting.
The nine - member committee,
headed by Dave Carr, suggested
that since the taking of examina
tions seemed to be an individual
department problem, the decision
on whether or not students should
be allowed to take examinations
out of the classroom should come
from the individual departments.
The decisions would come as a
result of departmental meetings
with major students in each depart
ment, the committee explained.
The plan provides that:
1. A major student in each de
partment would he selected to
confer with the head of his ma
jor department on adopting a de
partment policy relating to the
examination question.
2. The major student and the
department head would then con
fer and plan a meeting of all fac
ulty members within the depart
ment where a policy would again
he discussed.
3. Next all students within the
major department would he con
tacted and asked to attend a
meeting of their respective de
partments where a proposed de
partmental policy would he pre
sented for final discussion and
approval.
If this plan is approved, it could
be likely that various University
dopartjnents would have different
policies on the taking of examina
tions, but once such policies arc
approved, students would be ex
pected to abide by them.
The w.holc problem concerning
the taking of examinations out of
the classsroom came to a head last
summer when Dean of Students
H. Donald Winbigler reported that
within the past year some profes
sors have expressed concern that
increasing numbers of students
were taking examinations out of
class.
The problem again came up for
consideration of Excom last quar
ter and that body appointed the
nine - member committee, com
posed of students and faculty
members, to survey the problem
and report its findings to Excom
at a later date.
The committee is composed of the
following members: David Carr,
Nancy Nicholson, and James Mitch
ell from Excom; Bill Dickinson, for
mer member of Men's Council; Car
ol Folsom, former member of Wom
en's Council; Norm Lenzer, Funda
mental Standard Committee; Skip
Smith, Student - Faculty Education
Committee; and Dr. George H.
Knolcs and Dr. Clifford F. Wcigle
from the faculty. ,
Carr said his committee inter
viewed 21 University department
heads during the last quarter and
that the general feeling was that a
problem did exist and that a clear
cut ruling should be made.
Some faculty members reported
that no problem of any extent ex
isted in their departments.
Carr said his committee found"
that taking exams out of class be
gan to grow from about 1945 to the
point where it has nqw become a
tradition.
A special committee studying clarification of the Honor Code
proposed to. the Executive Committee last night a plan to solve
the drawn-out problem of whether or not students should be
allowed to take examinations out of the classroom.
