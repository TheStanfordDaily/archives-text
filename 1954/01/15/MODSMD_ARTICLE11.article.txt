# Ike Requests More Social Security Pay
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 (UP).
President Eisenhower asked
Congress today to raise social
security benefits, extend them
to 10,000,000 more persons and
increase the tax up to $12 a year
to help "reduce . . . destitution
to the minimum" in America.
In a special 2,500-word message
to the House and Senate, he said
helping people provide economic se
curity for their old age, and for
their families when they die, are
among "proper aims of all levels of
government, including the federal
government."
The President did not specify what
benefit increases he favors. But
chairman Daniel A. Reed (R-N.Y.)
of the House ways and means com
mittee promptly introduced legis
lation to raise old age insurance
benefits at least $5 a month.
His bills, prepared with admin
istration guidance, would increase
maximum benefits from the pres
ent $85 to $108.50 a month. The
maximum payment to a married
person would go up from $127.50
to $102.75. The maximum family
benefit would go up from $108.75
to $100 a month.
Calling for continuation of the
"basic principles" of the present
"contributory" system which bases
benefits on earnings, the President
offered a seven-point plan for "con
structive and positive" improve
ments. These included protection of
pension rights of disabled workers
and allowance for higher outside
earnings by social security bene
ficiaries.
Some Republican leaders and
many Democrats in Congress wel
comed the program but several im
portant members of both parties
were non-committal.
Reed, whose bills generally
covered (he President's proposals,
promised hearings on them when
work is finished on current tax
revision—probably early in March.
