# Fraternities, Clubs Pledge
## Clubs 
### 
Eating club rushing went back to
individual clubs after the last all
club function of the current fresh
man rushing season, Tuesday night's
open house at the clubs building.
The clubs continue to entertain
freshman men at meals and par
ties. Most clubs have pledged
several freshmen already, but
Interclub Council president Buzz
Feinberg emphasizes that clubs
rush on a year-around basis.
Pledging procedure in Stanford's
seven eating clubs is left up to the
individual clubs. This year the
clubs, unlike the fraternities, be
gan rushing at the end of fall quar
ter and have had unlimited social
contact with freshman men since
then.
