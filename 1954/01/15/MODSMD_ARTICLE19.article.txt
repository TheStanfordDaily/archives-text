# Card Basketballers to Meet Bears in important Pair
## â€˜Good Guys' Meet 'Bad Guys' Tonight at 8:30 in the Pavilion 
### PETE GROTHE Sports Editor, The Daily 
Stanford, the good guys, meet Cal, the bad guys, in the week
end basketball bill of fare in which the good guys will try to
upend "California's best basketball team of all time."
The two teams sguare off at 8:30 tonight in the Pavilion and
move over to Berkeley tomorrow at 8:30 for the second game.

Unhappily, two of the best guys
for the good guys are out of com
mission. Ron Tomsic, the best
scorer on the Pacific slope, is out
for the season. Co-captain Olie
Su/.dalefT, believed to be fit by
the Cal series, will only see lim
ited action, if he sees action at all.
His damaged knee has been slow
to mend.
As publicist Don Liebendorfer
said yesterday,"The loss of Tomsic
and Suzdaleff really hurts. It's the

same as if Garrett and Morley were
unable to play for the football
team."
However, Barry Brown and Ron
Wagner have demonstrated that
starting positions fit them like a
glove. And with these two plus
stand bys Russ Lawler, Don DeLong,
and George Selleck, the Indians arc
delightfully upset-minded.
If practice sessions this past
week mean anything, the star of
the series might well be DeLong,
the (i -2 co - captain from San
Francisco. DeLong has been
pouring in baskets with fright
ening consistency.
The other two reliables, Lawler
and Selleck, are numbers one ami
three, respectively, In league scor
ing.
The series will witness two spec
tacular individual duels . . . be
tween Lawler and Bob McKeen and
between Selleck and Bob Matheny.
McKeen, the (i -7, 230 - pound
moose from Piedmont, is a strong
candidate for All-American hon
ors. He outplayed Lawler last;
year, but Lawler has improved
tremendously and might well be
up to the Herculean task of out
scoring McKeen.
Ma then j' has also been mentioned
as an All-American possibility. He
is the Cal play-maker, the man who
holds the team together. Besides
that, he is strong defensively and
he can sink some unbelievable
shots.
It will be up to Selleck, with
two years less experience, and
three inches shorter, to outdo Ma
theny. Card mentor Bob Burnett
says that Selleck will be the best
passer in I'CC Southern Division
history.
Selleck is one of the hottest hoop
prospects to hit the Farm in many
a moon. Besides his spectacular

passing ability, which sets up bas
kets, he is a deadly shot from any
part of the floor and an indefati
gable hustler.
Cal's starting forwards will be
Bob Albo (<J-4), who is much the
same style of player that Stan
ford's George Zaninovich was last
year, and Dick Tamberg (6-5),
who has been a pleasant surprise
to Coach \ibs Price.
The other starter is guard
Frank Hess (fi-0). a promising
soph.
This team, which bopped strong
UCLA twice last weekend, is
ranked by many sports writers as
Cal's "best-ever." The answer will
be known at 10:30 p.m. Saturday.

three inches shorter, to outdo Ma
theny. Card mentor Bob Burnett
says that Selleck will be the best
passer in I'CC Southern Division
history.
Selleck is one of the hottest hoop
prospects to hit the Farm in many
a moon. Besides his spectacular

passing ability, which sets up bas
kets, he is a deadly shot from any
part of the floor and an indefati
gable hustler.
Cal's starting forwards will be
Bob Albo (<J-4), who is much the
same style of player that Stan
ford's George Zaninovich was last
year, and Dick Tamberg (6-5),
who has been a pleasant surprise
to Coach \ibs Price.
The other starter is guard
Frank Hess (fi-0). a promising
soph.
This team, which bopped strong
UCLA twice last weekend, is
ranked by many sports writers as
Cal's "best-ever." The answer will
be known at 10:30 p.m. Saturday.
Stanford, the good guys, meet Cal, the bad guys, in the week
end basketball bill of fare in which the good guys will try to
upend "California's best basketball team of all time."
The two teams sguare off at 8:30 tonight in the Pavilion and
move over to Berkeley tomorrow at 8:30 for the second game.

Unhappily, two of the best guys
for the good guys are out of com
mission. Ron Tomsic, the best
scorer on the Pacific slope, is out
for the season. Co-captain Olie
Su/.dalefT, believed to be fit by
the Cal series, will only see lim
ited action, if he sees action at all.
His damaged knee has been slow
to mend.
As publicist Don Liebendorfer
said yesterday,"The loss of Tomsic
and Suzdaleff really hurts. It's the

same as if Garrett and Morley were
unable to play for the football
team."
However, Barry Brown and Ron
Wagner have demonstrated that
starting positions fit them like a
glove. And with these two plus
stand bys Russ Lawler, Don DeLong,
and George Selleck, the Indians arc
delightfully upset-minded.
If practice sessions this past
week mean anything, the star of
the series might well be DeLong,
the (i -2 co - captain from San
Francisco. DeLong has been
pouring in baskets with fright
ening consistency.
The other two reliables, Lawler
and Selleck, are numbers one ami
three, respectively, In league scor
ing.
The series will witness two spec
tacular individual duels . . . be
tween Lawler and Bob McKeen and
between Selleck and Bob Matheny.
McKeen, the (i -7, 230 - pound
moose from Piedmont, is a strong
candidate for All-American hon
ors. He outplayed Lawler last;
year, but Lawler has improved
tremendously and might well be
up to the Herculean task of out
scoring McKeen.
Ma then j' has also been mentioned
as an All-American possibility. He
is the Cal play-maker, the man who
holds the team together. Besides
that, he is strong defensively and
he can sink some unbelievable
shots.
It will be up to Selleck, with
two years less experience, and
three inches shorter, to outdo Ma
theny. Card mentor Bob Burnett
