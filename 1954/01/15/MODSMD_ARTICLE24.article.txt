# A 						Job Well Done
## 
### 
For slightly less than a full quarter, a com
mittee composed of nine student leaders, ap
pointed by the ASSU Executive Committee, has
patiently and very carefully conducted a sur
vey related to a question of interpretation of (
the Honor Code. The problem revolves around
the question of whether or not students should
be allowed to take examinations out of the
classroom, a matter that never has been offi
cially set down as a specific aspect of the
Honor Code.
The committee, after intensive interviews
with 21 University department heads, found
generally that the faculty believes a problem
does exist and that, moreover, a clear-cut ruling
on ihe examination question should be devised.
Similarly, the committee found that the num
ber of students taking examinations out of the
classroom has grown consistently in proportion
during the past decade to the point where it
now has become a tradition.
In an attempt to solve the problems this issue
poses, the committee proposed to the Executive

Committee a plan whereby both students and
faculty members would have an opportunity to
work out a solution together. Whether the plan,
as reported in yesterday's Daily, is a sound one
or not is not a matter for us to decide right now.
We feel that students must be given time to
carefully weigh and decide the facts on the
issue and to study the plan carefully and in
telligently.
At this point, The Daily firmly believes that
the work done by the nine-member commit
tee, headed by Dave Carr, Men's How repre
sentative to Excom, is meritorious and un
questionably satisfactory in itself. For the
first time, perhaps, a full report on faculty
opinion on the issue has been accumulated
for consideration by students. In short, a
comprehensive and complete job seems to
have been accomplished.
We would like to see this same kind of atti
tude prevail throughout the next few weeks
when the examination-Honor Code problem
and plan come up for debate and solution.
