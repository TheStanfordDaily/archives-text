### DICK MANSFIELD 
When the Stanford Police department recently
chained off History Corner to automobile traffic,
Schools of Thought arose:
(1) This is a good thing; it saves eating club men
four steps between Toyon Hall and the post office.
(2) This is a bad thing; it adds 17 feet to the dis-

tance fraternity men must drive
to reach Palo Alto.
(3) This solution to the Engi
neering Corner traffic problem is
incorrect; they .should exclude the
pedestrians instead of the cars.
(4) This solution is incomplete;
if they want to protect pedestri
ans from reckless drivers, they
should chain off the whole state
of California.
Now this fourth theory is a
4 ..;A~ l u J .1 il , xi

trine harsh. Granted that the state of Oregon oc
casionally makes bold to ask where those Califor
nians in their souped-up Cadillacs liecame so skillful
at mowing down tractors ant! livestock. The Cali
fornia driver, with his subtle distinction between the
Hollywood Stop and the Santa Monica Stop, is an
awesome creature indeed, but that subdivision of
California driver, Stanford driver, deserves special
attention.
As a matter of fact, the Stanford driver now has his
own special driving test, drawn up by the Engineer
ing Corner Highway Engineers Association when
the chams deprived them of food for thought. Here
are a few excerpts from this recently-published
work.
1. The four-way stop near Stern Hall is
(a) someone's idea of a joke.
(b) another waste of University money.
(e) a warning to pedestrians.
(d) all of these.
2. Panama Street is one-way going west. This means

(a) when going east on Panama Street, back up.
(b) when parking in Panama Street, point car
west.
(c) when entering Metallurgy parking lot, drive
last.
(d) any of these.
3. Galvez Street is
(a) Encina's parking lot.
(b) the poor man's Bonneville Salt Flats.
(c) MG heaven.
(d) open country for pedestrians.
4. There is a sign on Palm Drive which says 25
Miles Per Hour. It means
(a) drive 35 miles per hour.
(b) drive 45 miles per hour.
(c) drive 55 miles per hour.
(d) don't know.
5. When stopping at the post office, park
(a) in the street.
(b) on the sidewalk.
(c) at the Stern Parking Lot.
(d) off campus.
A fitting footnote to these few representative selec
tions from the Stanford driving test is a passage or
two from the Compleat Stanford Driver, prepared by
an anonymous speeder:
"Remember, Stanford drivers, to always take your
car with you! Never be without it! Take it to the
Sunday Evening Movies, to classes, to basketball
games. Above all, take it to the library.
"And a few DON'Ts. Above all, don't stop. Keep
rolling from the time you turn on the engine until
you get where you are going. Unexpected moves
like stops will confuse other drivers. If you must
stop — for instance, if a chasm opens up just in
front of you—get it over with quickly. Just jump on
your brakes. It is not the Stanford way to be gradual.
"Fast driving, Stanfordites!"

A fitting footnote to these few representative selec
tions from the Stanford driving test is a passage or
two from the Compleat Stanford Driver, prepared by
an anonymous speeder:
"Remember, Stanford drivers, to always take your
car with you! Never be without it! Take it to the
Sunday Evening Movies, to classes, to basketball
games. Above all, take it to the library.
"And a few DON'Ts. Above all, don't stop. Keep
rolling from the time you turn on the engine until
you get where you are going. Unexpected moves
like stops will confuse other drivers. If you must
stop — for instance, if a chasm opens up just in
front of you—get it over with quickly. Just jump on
your brakes. It is not the Stanford way to be gradual.
"Fast driving, Stanfordites!"

When the Stanford Police department recently
chained off History Corner to automobile traffic,
Schools of Thought arose:
(1) This is a good thing; it saves eating club men
four steps between Toyon Hall and the post office.
(2) This is a bad thing; it adds 17 feet to the dis-

tance fraternity men must drive
to reach Palo Alto.
(3) This solution to the Engi
neering Corner traffic problem is
incorrect; they .should exclude the
pedestrians instead of the cars.
(4) This solution is incomplete;
if they want to protect pedestri
ans from reckless drivers, they
should chain off the whole state
of California.
Now this fourth theory is a
4 ..;A~ l u J .1 il , xi

trine harsh. Granted that the state of Oregon oc
casionally makes bold to ask where those Califor
nians in their souped-up Cadillacs liecame so skillful
at mowing down tractors ant! livestock. The Cali
fornia driver, with his subtle distinction between the
Hollywood Stop and the Santa Monica Stop, is an
awesome creature indeed, but that subdivision of
California driver, Stanford driver, deserves special
attention.
As a matter of fact, the Stanford driver now has his
own special driving test, drawn up by the Engineer
ing Corner Highway Engineers Association when
the chams deprived them of food for thought. Here
are a few excerpts from this recently-published
work.
