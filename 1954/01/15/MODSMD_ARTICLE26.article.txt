# CAMPUS OPINION
## â€˜High School' Journalism 
### 
To the Editor:
One reads a groat deal about freedom of the press
and expression of public opinion in a college news
paper. Combined with this is the responsibility such
a paper owes to its institution. We feel that the Stan
ford Daily was definitely negligent in its responsi
bility when it permitted the printing of Irwin John
son's "Shooting the Breeze" column of January 14th.
Remarks such as a "pseudo athlete from Cal" and,

referring to Bob Matheny, "overrated showboat" are
insults to both the person and the institution and have
no place irt a paper that uses the Stanford name. In
addition the entire tone of the article was that of a
high school freshman building up his team.
The Daily refers to Stanford men continually. If
that's the case let's act like it.
Yours,
