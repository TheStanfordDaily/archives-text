# Undefeated Frosh Cagers Face Bears
## 
### 
"We're going to have to play our
best game of the season to beat i
Cal," said freshman coach Dick
Clegg yesterday as his undefeated
(3-0) cagers concluded their last |
practice in preparation for the two
game series with the Blue and Gold
frosh beginning toni>.!ht.
Leading the Berkley Cubs' fast
breaking attack are the two guards,
Gabe Arrillaga and Mike Diaz, who
are presently leading the team scor
ing and supplying the spark for the
team. Diaz, who is the shortest man
on the starting five at 5 ft. 10 in., was
the top scorer in Northern California
hiiÂ»h school play last season.
At center for California will be
Everett McKeen, brother of Bob on
the varsity, while rounding out the
team at forwards are Joe Banales
arid A 1 Kyte. McKeen and Banales
have been especially valuable to the
Blue and Gold frosh with their con
sistent rebounding.
Meanwhile, Papoose coach Clegg
will be starting the same five that
he has been counting on all season.
Team high scorers Dennis Mahoney
and Bill Bond will be in the forward
slots, Nick Vojvodich will handle
the center slot, and Beppo Dyer and
Hap Wagner will play guards.
Vojvodich has been in the rest
home with a cold but should never
theless see considerable action. Re
serves Carl Isaacs, Dick Farman, and
Fred Lindholm should also do quite
a bit of playing.
Tonight's game will be played in
the Pavilion at 6:15, immediately
before the varsity game, while to
morrow's tilt will be at the Califor
nia Men's Gymnasium, also at (i:l5.
