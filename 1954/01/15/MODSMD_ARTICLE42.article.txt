ATHLETE OF THE WEEKâ€”This week's Daily sportswriters' "Athlete of the Week" is George
Selleck, guard on Bob Burnett's Stanford basketball team. Selleck was a unanimous selection
following his superlative play in the two games against USC in Los Angeles last weekend. The
little sophomore from Compton was an outstanding scorer, sparked the Indians with his hus
tling defensive play, and left the Southern California fans speechless with a display of precision
passing.
