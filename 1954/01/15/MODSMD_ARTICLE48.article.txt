This play, which was written in
'.he late lGth century, is one of the
!>cst examples of blank verse
drama, and set a pattern of verse

which Shakespeare followed in
his greatest tragedies. The epi
sodic form is taken from the mor
ality plays, but in general the play
may be described as a dramatic
poem, with one central figure to
symbolize aspiration toward
knowledge.
This is the first of a series of simi
lar productions, the first in several
years.
Tickets may be obtained at the
box office for 25 cents.
