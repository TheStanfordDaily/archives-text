# FROM ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION
## Food Research Institute Given $500,000 Gift 
### 
A $500,000 gift for additional endowment of Stanford Univer
sity s Food Research Institute has been received from the Rocke
feller Foundation, it was announced today by President Wallace
Sterling.
Trofessor Merrill K. Bennett, director of the Institute, said the gift

is the second largest in the research
organization's 33-year history.
''The Rockefeller Foundation's
staff," Professor Bennett added.
"It will be a powerful stimulus in
our research and principal aimâ€”to
promote understanding of the
world's problems in food produc
tion, distribution, and consump
tion."

Sincc its founding in 1921, Stan
ford's Food Research Institute has
been financed jointly by endow
ment and from general funds of the
University. Numerous grants for
specific research projects have also
been provided by various individ
uals and philanthropic organiza
tions.
Establishment of the Institute was
suggested by forme r President
Herbert Hoover, Stanford alumnus
and the nation's food administrator
during World War I. He pointed out
the importance of scientific investi
gation of significant world food
problems.
The investigations have been di
and economic aspects of food, as
well as long-term trends or cycles.
The Institute researchers thus seek
basic information about food, in
contrast to such applied research
as diet studies and analysis of
foodstuffs.
"The World's Food," a new book
by Pro f essor Bennett, will be re
leased shortly by Harper and Broth
ers.
