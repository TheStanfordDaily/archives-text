# 337 Rushees Join Fraternities
## Saturday Card Signing Ends '54 Formal Rush 
### JOHN McFEE 
After two weeks of open, houses, dinners, parties, and other
rushing activity, a pledge class totaling 337 signed pledge cards
Saturday morning in the Women's Clubhouse, and fraternity for
mal rushing came to an end for 1954.
This year's total number of pledges falls 47 below the record

who pledged last year at this
time.
The average pledge class this year
has 14.7 members, and ranges all
the way from 6 to 27 men per house.
The largest number of men were
pledged by Alpha Tau Omega, with
27 pledges, and by Alpha Sigma Phi
and Sigma Nu, each with 20 new
members.
At pledge signing Saturday all 23
pledge classes signed cards together
inside and outside the crowded
Women's Clubhouse. The atmos
phere was a happy one, and also a
tired one after two weeks of rush
ing.
"It's been a great two weeks,
but I'm glad it's over," comment
ed Mike Glass, an SAE pledge.
"I'm tired, but rushing and
pledging has been a lot of fun,"
said AKL pledge Tom Goode
nough.
"Rushing takes up a lot of
time, but it is sure a great feeling
to pledge," said Phil King of Delta
Tau Delta.
One or two pledge classes were
of a noisier disposition Saturday
morning. The 18 Chi Psi pledges
got together and threw their rush-

ing chairman into the Union pond,
while the AKL's brought one of
their pledges to the signing with a
heavy , chain wrapped around his
neck.
"The rushing season as a whole
this year has run very smoothly,"
commented Gene Dils, Interfra
tcrnity Council president. Com
pared with last year, 1954 rushing
has been shorter and earlier in
the quarter. This year about twice
as much time was given to open
houses and about half as much
time to formal rushing as in for
mer years.
Although formal rushing activi
ties have ended, rushing will con
tinue to a lesser extent for the rest
of the year.
