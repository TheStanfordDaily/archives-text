# Rampaging Weekend Weather Brings Floods, Slides
## 
### United Press 
Small slides and water runoffs
threatened highways from San
Francisco to Oregon as storms bat
tered the coast this weekend.
Gusts of wind up to 75 miles an
hour and a heavy rain lashed at the
San Francisco Bay Area and most
of Northern California. Along the
coast trees, telephone and power
lines were felled and some lowland
farms were flooded. The town of
Ukiah in Northern California was
cut off by floods, but authorities
said there was no serious damage.
Heavy snowslides rumbled down
the mountains onto transcontinental
Highway 40, closing it early this
morning.
The Weather Bureau at San
Francisco reported a new storm on
the way and said that if it stays in
the mountain area for any length
of time it will cause real trouble.
More rain and snow fell «in the
Pacific Northwest where the first
heavy snowfalls of the season fell
Saturday. Portland, Ore., dug out
of more than six inches of snow and
Seattle had six to 10 inches.
It was the coldest weather of the ;
season from the Rockies eastward
and temperature readings* resem
bled a schoolboy's exercise in sub
traction —full of minus signs.
It was —33 at Bismarck, N.D., —28
at Mason City, la., —25 at Minne
apolis, —14 at Madison. Wis., —13
at Milwaukee, —12 at Des Moines,
—8 at Norfolk. Neb., —7 at Chicago,
and 5 above at St. Louis.


SLIDES FORCE EVACUATION—Heavy rains which struck the Northwest in the past week
washed the earth and foundations right out from under these homes on Queen Ann Hill in
Seattle. Although no one was injured, residents were forced to abandon their homes.
