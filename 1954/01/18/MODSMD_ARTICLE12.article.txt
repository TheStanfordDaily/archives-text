# DEADLOCK BROKEN
## Meeting Place, Date Set For Berlin Big Four Talks 
### 
BERLIN, Jan. 17 (UP) â€”Berlin's four commandants, in a 12-hour
meeting that ended early today, broke a 10-day deadlock by
agreeing that the foreign ministers will meet the first week in the
United States sector's 500-room Allied Control Authority building,
the second week in the Soviets' $30,000,000 embassy on Unter den

Linden, and the third week again
in the ACA building.
The commandants threw into the
laps of the foreign ministers the
question of where the meetings will
be held after the third week. It was
believed they could continue to al
ternate to prevent the Big Four
meeting from bogging down over
such a minor crisis.
The West was displeased because
it surrendered in principle to the
Soviet demand that half the meet
ings be held in the Allied sectors
and half in the Communist sector.
But by accepting the Soviet terms
the West ensured the conference
would begin Jan. 25 as scheduled.
Although the commandants
reached the agreement in their fifth
marathon session, they immediately
fell into a dispute over wording of
the communique announcing their
decision and did not release it until
this afternoon.
The Soviets walked out of the
Control Council March 20, 1948.
The commandants referred other
technical problems to teams of ex
perts after making it certain the
foreign ministers will be able to
convene as scheduled. Allied work
men already had been preparing the
ACA building for the meeting.
