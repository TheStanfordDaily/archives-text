# Masters to Study Plan For Parking Fee at Games
## 
### 
Athletic Director A 1 Masters v/as instructed Friday by the Stan
ford Athletic Board to study the feasibility of a plan submitted by
ASSU President Don Lozabnick to impose a parking fee on cam
pus lots near the Stadium during major football games.
Masters was told to study the plan and determine if it could

be administered and if it might
versely affect game attendance. He
was asked to report his findings at
the next meeting, which will be in
February.
The Board, which is made up of
student, alumni, and administration
representatives, met in the BAC.
Though no fixed price is settled
upon in Lozabnick's proposal, he
did figure that if 50 cents were
charged the Athletic Department
could gross $10,000 from parking,
provided that the Stadium were
packed.
Lozabnick suggested that a park
ing charge be made at the Navy and
Illinois games of the forthcoming
season and at the Big Game two
years hence.
In submitting his plan, Lozabnick
argued that car owners generally are
accustomed to paying parking
charges and would not balk at such
a fee on campus. He pointed out
that drivers willingly pay a park
ing toll when attending movies and
other events.
Alumni member of the Board, J.
Derrol Chace, on the other hand,
argued that the imposition of a fee
would counter a tradition of free
parking established when the Stadi
um was constructed.
Masters, commenting on the
plan, expressed concern that a
charge might turn people away
from the games and hack to their
television sets. But, he addfd, "I
would favor any plan that would
guarantee the department extra
revenue."
In other business, the Board
studierl the possibility of presenting
jackets to (he traveling squads of
the various winfer and spring quar
ter sports, and approved salary in
creases for several coaches.
