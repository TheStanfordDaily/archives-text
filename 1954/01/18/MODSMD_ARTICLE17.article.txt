PANMUNJOM. Korea, Monday,
Jan. 18 (UP) â€”An Indian spokes
man said today there was "every
chance" Korean war prisoners will
not be returned to their captors
VVcacnsday because tin Commu
nists were "expected" to refuse to
receive them.
The Reds have not replied to the
Indian proposal to turn back more
than 22,000 war prisoners on that
date, and their mysterious failure to
do so has put the entire neutral na
tions camp on edge.
