# Hot, Cold Card Cagers Collapse Against Bears
## Cat Rallies To Sweep Double Bill 
### PETE GROTHE Sports Editor, The Daily 
Stanford looked like the best
basketball team in the nation for
three quarters and like a Palo
Alto YMCA team the other five
as a muscular California outfit
chilled the Indians twice, 83 to
68 and 56 to 50 last week end.
The double racking put California
in the PCC Southern Division lead
with four wins and no losses. Stan
ford is tied for third with one suc
cess and three unsuccesses.
The 7,000 thrill-drenched fans at
Saturday night's tiff at Cul saw a
Stanford team that was as hot the
first half as it was cold the second.
The Indians got off to a quick
4 to 0 lead, and Cal's mammoth
rooting section sat back confidently

to watch the lead evaporate. But it
didn't. At one point forward Don
DeLong made three buckets in a
row.
Going into the second quarter,
Boh Burnett's Cards held the
lead, 17 to 13. As the second
quarter progressed, Stanford's ad
vantage over Cal's "best - ever"
basketball team increased. lluss
Lawler, George Selleck, Don De-
Long, and company poured in the
' two - pointers, while holding the
vaunted Boh McKeen, Boh Ma
theny, and Boh Albo cold.
When the dust had lifted, the
Indians walked off at half - time,
amidst hysterical cheering by the
Stanford rooters, with a 35 to 24
lead.
The amazing aspect of the first
half was that Stanford outsnookrred
the Bears at their own forte—re
bounding. The Indians, with De-
Long, Lawler, and Barry Brown do
ing yeoman work, grabbed 20, while
the Bears got 17. It was the first
time the Bears had been beaten on
the boards all year.
The second half should he writ
ten in the obituary column rather
than on a sports page. The Cards
could garner only four points, all
of them free throws, in the third
quarter. Twelve and a half min
utes progressed in the second half


UP AND IN—Stanford guard George Selleck scoots past Cal
guard Frank Hess (10) for a driving lay-in Friday in the Pavilion.
Looking on is Stanford's Ron Wagner. Selleck's 19-point effort
wasn't enough as the Bears won, 83-68.

before Stanford could tally a field
goal. They were that cold.
With 35 seconds gone in the
fourth quarter, Cal tied the game
at 39-all, and with McKeen, Ma
theny, and Dick Tamberg leading
the way, they were never headed.
McKeen, the 6-7V2, 230 - pound
moose with the deft touch, was
high-point man Saturday with 23.
Selleck was high for Stanford with
13.
What the Indians did in the
first half Saturday, they did in
the first quarter Friday. They had
an 18 to 15 lead shortly before
the end of the first quarter, but
from then on it was all Cal.
The Berkeleyites led, 47 to 33, at
the half and G5 to 46 at the end of
the third quarter. Selleck and

Tamberg were high with 19 points
each.
The Indians' next conference
game is against UCLA in three
weeks, at which time co - captain
Olie Suzdaleff should be in fine
fettle.

didn't. At one point forward Don
DeLong made three buckets in a
row.
Going into the second quarter,
Boh Burnett's Cards held the
lead, 17 to 13. As the second
quarter progressed, Stanford's ad
vantage over Cal's "best - ever"
basketball team increased. lluss
Lawler, George Selleck, Don De-
Long, and company poured in the
' two - pointers, while holding the
vaunted Boh McKeen, Boh Ma
theny, and Boh Albo cold.
When the dust had lifted, the
Indians walked off at half - time,
amidst hysterical cheering by the
Stanford rooters, with a 35 to 24
lead.
The amazing aspect of the first
half was that Stanford outsnookrred
the Bears at their own forte—re
bounding. The Indians, with De-
Long, Lawler, and Barry Brown do
ing yeoman work, grabbed 20, while
the Bears got 17. It was the first
time the Bears had been beaten on
the boards all year.
The second half should he writ
ten in the obituary column rather
than on a sports page. The Cards
could garner only four points, all
of them free throws, in the third
quarter. Twelve and a half min
utes progressed in the second half


UP AND IN—Stanford guard George Selleck scoots past Cal
guard Frank Hess (10) for a driving lay-in Friday in the Pavilion.
Looking on is Stanford's Ron Wagner. Selleck's 19-point effort
wasn't enough as the Bears won, 83-68.

before Stanford could tally a field
goal. They were that cold.
With 35 seconds gone in the
fourth quarter, Cal tied the game
at 39-all, and with McKeen, Ma
theny, and Dick Tamberg leading
the way, they were never headed.
McKeen, the 6-7V2, 230 - pound
moose with the deft touch, was
high-point man Saturday with 23.
Selleck was high for Stanford with
13.
What the Indians did in the
first half Saturday, they did in
the first quarter Friday. They had
an 18 to 15 lead shortly before
the end of the first quarter, but
from then on it was all Cal.
The Berkeleyites led, 47 to 33, at
the half and G5 to 46 at the end of
the third quarter. Selleck and

Tamberg were high with 19 points
each.
The Indians' next conference
game is against UCLA in three
weeks, at which time co - captain
Olie Suzdaleff should be in fine
fettle.

Stanford looked like the best
basketball team in the nation for
three quarters and like a Palo
Alto YMCA team the other five
as a muscular California outfit
chilled the Indians twice, 83 to
68 and 56 to 50 last week end.

in the PCC Southern Division lead
with four wins and no losses. Stan

goal. They were that cold.
With 35 seconds gone in the
fourth quarter, Cal tied the game
at 39-all, and with McKeen, Ma
theny, and Dick Tamberg leading
the way, they were never headed.
McKeen, the 6-7V2, 230 - pound
moose with the deft touch, was
high-point man Saturday with 23.
Selleck was high for Stanford with
13.
What the Indians did in the
first half Saturday, they did in
the first quarter Friday. They had
an 18 to 15 lead shortly before
the end of the first quarter, but
from then on it was all Cal.
The Berkeleyites led, 47 to 33, at
the half and G5 to 46 at the end of
the third quarter. Selleck and

Tamberg were high with 19 points
each.
The Indians' next conference
game is against UCLA in three
weeks, at which time co - captain
Olie Suzdaleff should be in fine
fettle.

Stanford looked like the best
basketball team in the nation for
three quarters and like a Palo
Alto YMCA team the other five
as a muscular California outfit
chilled the Indians twice, 83 to
68 and 56 to 50 last week end.
The double racking put California
in the PCC Southern Division lead
with four wins and no losses. Stan
ford is tied for third with one suc
cess and three unsuccesses.
The 7,000 thrill-drenched fans at
Saturday night's tiff at Cul saw a
Stanford team that was as hot the
first half as it was cold the second.
The Indians got off to a quick
4 to 0 lead, and Cal's mammoth
rooting section sat back confidently

to watch the lead evaporate. But it
didn't. At one point forward Don
DeLong made three buckets in a
row.
Going into the second quarter,
Boh Burnett's Cards held the
lead, 17 to 13. As the second
quarter progressed, Stanford's ad
vantage over Cal's "best - ever"
basketball team increased. lluss
Lawler, George Selleck, Don De-
Long, and company poured in the
' two - pointers, while holding the
vaunted Boh McKeen, Boh Ma
theny, and Boh Albo cold.
When the dust had lifted, the
Indians walked off at half - time,
amidst hysterical cheering by the
Stanford rooters, with a 35 to 24
lead.
The amazing aspect of the first
half was that Stanford outsnookrred
the Bears at their own forte—re
bounding. The Indians, with De-
Long, Lawler, and Barry Brown do
ing yeoman work, grabbed 20, while
the Bears got 17. It was the first
time the Bears had been beaten on
the boards all year.

could garner only four points, all
