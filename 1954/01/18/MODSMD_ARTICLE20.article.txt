## 
### 
A Stanford student was hold up
Saturday night, but smart work on
his part saved $11.
Pierre Prodis, a Delta Upsilon
sophomore, was parked in West
ridge near Ladera when two men,
wearing black rag scarfs for m;i k: ,
opened the car doors and asked for
his wallet.
He persuaded them to let him
keep the wallet and $2. However,
oneÂ»of the bills he kept was a ton,
and he gave them the remaining
$3 he had.
