# Brandin Tells Palo Alto JC Of Land Plans
## 
### 
Details of Stanford's plans for the j
development of approximately 6,000
acres of its property into commer
cial, residential, and industrial
areas were outlined by University
Business Manager Alfred Brandin
last Friday night.
Brandin, speaking before a ban
quet of the Palo Alto Junior Cham
ber of Commerce, reported that
work on the shopping ccnter, to be
constructed between San Francis
cjuito Creek and Palo Alto Hospital,
is scheduled to begin in early April.
Several firms have negotiated
leases for land in the shopping
center area. The Emporium,
which lias already arranged a
lease of land for a store of 200.000
square feet, has begun negotia
tions with the University for
property which would provide a
150,000 - square - foot addition,
Brandin said.
The first unit of the shopping
center, scheduled for occupancy in
September of 1955, will contain 27
stores.
The residential v development of
Stanford lands may take anywhere
from 25 to 50 years to complete,
Brandin said, but eventually the
University anticipates a city of
40,000, with several elementary
schools, two junior high schools, and
a high school.
Nine neighborhoods arc planned
in the residential development.
Each will center around an ele
mentary school, recreation facili
ties, and a local shopping center,
and will be separated from other
neighborhoods by a "green belt."
The business manager told the
group of local businessmen at the
banquet that the University will
eventually annex all of its property
in Santa Clara County to the city
of alo Alto, with the exception of
3,000 acres reserved for the campus
itself.
Brandin specified four areas of
development for Stanford lands: the
commercial development containing
the main shopping center, the resi
dential areas of the nine "neighbor
hoods," and, in addition, a light in
dustrial zone surrounding the pres
ent Varian and Eastman Kodak
plants and a professional and mul
tiple family housing area west of
the shopping center.
