# CODE PROPOSAL
## Departments Should Make Own Policy 
### 
A special Executive Commit
tee subcommittee, which last
week completed a quarter-long
study of an interpretation of the
Honor Code, yesterday issued a
formal report on ils findings.
The report is now available in the
ASSU office to students who are in
terested in studying the problem.
High points of the report were
first outlined at last Wednesday's
Excom meeting by the committee's
chairman, Dave Carr, Men's Row
representative to Excom.
The committee, composed of
seven student leaders and two fac
ulty members, asked the heads of
21 University departments a series
of 14 questions calling for their
opinion on whether or not stu
dents should be allowed to take
examinations out of the classroom.
The Honor Code itself makes no
clear ruling in the matter, and with
in the past year several professors
have reported that the number of
students leaving rooms to take ex
ams has been mounting.
Some faculty members, Carr said,
reported no problem of any extent
existed in their departments. And a
professor in the History Department
said students were leaving the class
room in "droves."
Some faculty members requested
a formal ruling on the question for
other reasons—namely, that if a
need for interpretation arises on a
test, or if the test contains an
error, it would be impossible to
conveniently inform students who
left the room about these changes
or explain the test to them.
Other faculty members said they
believed examinations should be
given to students under the same
conditions, whether good or bad, so
that all have an equal chance to ex
press their knowledge of the sub
ject.
Carr's committee stated that a so
lution to the problem of examina
tions needs to be stated clearly, but
that it needs to come about through
"student initiative."
The committee proposed a plan,
contained in its report released
yesterday, which would solve the
unanswered question of whether
students should take exams out
of the classroom.
The plan comes up at this week's
Excom meeting for further consid
eration and discussion.
Briefly, the plan calls for the
formulation of a departmental policy
which would take the viewpoint of
students into consideration.
Basically, the committee added,
the departmental policy plan is
similar to the program of leaving
the matter up to the discretion of
the professor. It differs, however,
in that it gives "greater formaliza
tion and direction and presents an
adequate opportunity to hear stu
dent voice," the committee said.
Another member of the commit
tee, Jim Mitchell, graduate students'
representative to Excom, said he
would present a minority report,
now in the ASSU office, on the
proposed plan to Excom this week.
Bill Dickinson, a member of the
committee, defended the plan and
claimed it would "give the profes
sors a ground on which to stand."
Carol Folsum, also of the com
mittee, likewise supported the plan,
adding that a departmental decis
ion would not necessarily be static,
but that it could be changed if
found inadequate.

Carr's committee stated that a so
lution to the problem of examina
tions needs to be stated clearly, but
that it needs to come about through
"student initiative."
The committee proposed a plan,
contained in its report released
yesterday, which would solve the
unanswered question of whether
students should take exams out
of the classroom.
The plan comes up at this week's
Excom meeting for further consid
eration and discussion.
Briefly, the plan calls for the
formulation of a departmental policy
which would take the viewpoint of
students into consideration.
Basically, the committee added,
the departmental policy plan is
similar to the program of leaving
the matter up to the discretion of
the professor. It differs, however,
in that it gives "greater formaliza
tion and direction and presents an
adequate opportunity to hear stu
dent voice," the committee said.
Another member of the commit
tee, Jim Mitchell, graduate students'
representative to Excom, said he
would present a minority report,
now in the ASSU office, on the
proposed plan to Excom this week.
Bill Dickinson, a member of the
committee, defended the plan and
claimed it would "give the profes
sors a ground on which to stand."
Carol Folsum, also of the com
mittee, likewise supported the plan,
adding that a departmental decis
ion would not necessarily be static,
but that it could be changed if
found inadequate.
A special Executive Commit
tee subcommittee, which last
week completed a quarter-long
study of an interpretation of the
Honor Code, yesterday issued a
formal report on ils findings.
The report is now available in the
ASSU office to students who are in
terested in studying the problem.
High points of the report were
first outlined at last Wednesday's
Excom meeting by the committee's
chairman, Dave Carr, Men's Row
representative to Excom.
The committee, composed of
seven student leaders and two fac
ulty members, asked the heads of
21 University departments a series
of 14 questions calling for their
opinion on whether or not stu
dents should be allowed to take
examinations out of the classroom.
The Honor Code itself makes no
clear ruling in the matter, and with
in the past year several professors
have reported that the number of
students leaving rooms to take ex
ams has been mounting.
Some faculty members, Carr said,
reported no problem of any extent
existed in their departments. And a
professor in the History Department
said students were leaving the class
room in "droves."
Some faculty members requested
a formal ruling on the question for
other reasons—namely, that if a
need for interpretation arises on a
test, or if the test contains an
error, it would be impossible to
conveniently inform students who
left the room about these changes
or explain the test to them.
Other faculty members said they
believed examinations should be
given to students under the same
conditions, whether good or bad, so
that all have an equal chance to ex
press their knowledge of the sub
ject.
