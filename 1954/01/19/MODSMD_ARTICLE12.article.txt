### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 (UP) — President Eisenhower asked
Congress today to set up a $25,000,000 "re-insurance" program so
private health insurance groups can give "broader health protec
tion to more families."
In a 3,300 - word special health message he also called lor

stepped-up government medical re
search, faster rehabilitation of the
disabled, and extension of govern
ment hospital-building aid to in
clude nursing homes and treatment
centers for patients able to walk.
He requested an entirely new
approach to all federal aid to
states, based on each state's health
and population, and allotment ot
some funds to "unique" regional
or national projects promising
"new and better ways" of serving
Americans.
Legislation was immediately in
troduced in both houses to carry out
the hospital construction part of the
bill, submitted by Chairman Charles
A. Wolverton (R., N.J.) of the
President's program. The Hou.se
House Commerce Committee, would
authorize a three - year expansion
of the present federal hospital
building law.
It would add, as new features re
quested by Mr. Eisenhower, $20,-•
000,000 a year in federal funds for
diagnostic centers, $10,000,000 annu
ally for rehabilitation centers, and
$1,000,000 yearly for nursing
homes.
The President said his program
rejects "socialization" or "govern
ment regimentation" of medicine
but accepts the principle that
! health is "among the concerns of
our government for the human
problems of our citizens."
Calling the health of the people
the "very essence" of the nation':;
strength and progress, he said hi:;
goal is to make the means for good
health "accessible to all" regard le
of "location, occupation, ago, race,
creed, or financial Status . . ."
The President said medical c re
often is a "serious burden," while
major illness "can become a finan
cial catastrophe for a normal Ami
ican family." He said the nation';,
private medical bill tops $9,000/)" 1
000 a year—s2oo a family—"and it
is rising."
Mr. Eisenhower's proposals, a
sharp break with former Preside n:
Truman's plan for compulsory fed
eral health insurance, drew prompt
applause from Republicans in Con
gress and limited praise from Dem
ocrats.
House Speaker Joseph W. Martin
Jr. (R., Mass.) called them a "pro
gressive step toward improving the
health of the country."
