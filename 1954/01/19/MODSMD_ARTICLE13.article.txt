## 
### 
Another crippling blow to the
hopes of the Stanford basketball
team was suffered late Saturday
night when O.leg Suzdaleff, an out
standing guard for the cagers, sus
tained facial injuries in an automo
bile accident and had to have 25
stitches taken in his face and neck.
The collision occurred in San
Francisco near Kezar Stadium.
Suzdaleff and his brother George
were driving home from the Cali-

fornia game in Berkeley. Suzdaleff's
brother, who was driving, appar
ently fell asleep, and the car
rammed a telephone poll.
Oleg was given emergency treat
ment and moved to the Palo Alto
Hospital, where the 25 stitches
were taken. He also suffered an
arm injury. His brother suffered a
severe knee injury. Oleg's condi
tion is listed by hospital authorities
as "good."
Suzdaleff was just recovering
from a knee injury suffered in prac
tice several weeks ago. He had
missed the league openers against
USC and made only token appear
ances against the Bears.
Suzdaleff is the second outstand
ing Card eager to be injured. Ron
Tomsic, who had been averaging 15
points a game, was injured shortly
before Christmas and hgs yet to
return to action. There is a possi
bility Tomsic may be through for
the entire season.
The Cards do not play another
league game for three weeks, when
Suzdaleff had been expected to be
back at full speed. Now, doctors
say his services will be lost for at
least "several weeks."
