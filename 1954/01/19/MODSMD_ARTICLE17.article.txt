# A 						Nickel's Not Enough
## 
### 
We wonder if Stanford isn't looking at the
National Students Association as if it were a
Coca-Cola machine—put your nickel in and
your Coke comes out.
If NSA were a machinc Stanford would be all
right. We've put our nickel in. We paid our
dues in October, sent delegates to the regional
conference in November, and appointed an
NSA co-ordinator in December.
But doesn't work like a
machine. "A purely mechanical "pay your
dues" kind of membership is worthless. NSA
isn't going to pour its benefits onto our campus
while we sit doing nothing. So if NSA is
going to have the fair test we want to give it,
we're going to have to work hard at our mem
bership.
And right now we wonder when we're
going to begin that work.
So far, v/e still haven't turned out the re
ports on our 118 ana' Honor Code which NSA
wants to p ss on to other schools where such
programs may be bogging down for lack of
help we can give them.
So far, most organizations on campus have
been told little about the reciprocal advice they

might get from other NSA schools.
So far, we've had no pro-and-con discussion
about the student-discount system NSA has
helped establish on other campuses and might
establish here.
So far, we've been told nothing about the
progress of NSA's national projects, projects
which are ours now.
And we haven't been given a chance to
start thinking about how we want ourselves
represented at the national convention next
July, an attendance which will require long
and careful planning if it is to be worthwhile.
Under the present organizational set-up, NSA
at Stanford is a one-man project. V/e wonder if
belonging to an association isn't too much work
for one person. We wonder if the coordinator
couldn't find persons on campus willing to help
if he looked for them.
Right now NSA's progress at Stanford looks
slight. But we hope that no one will rush to a
snap decision that NSA is just a machine that
isn't working.
We hope Stanford will see it's an association
whose worth we can't test until we begin to do
our share of the work. —Barbara Tuerk
