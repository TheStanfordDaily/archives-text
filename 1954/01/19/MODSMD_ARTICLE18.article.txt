# A 						justified Compromise
## 
### 
The Big Four Berlin conference of foreign
ministers is row assured of beginning on the
scheduled date, Jan. 25.
This assurance came early Sunday morning
when representatives cf France, Britain, the
United Slates, and Soviet Russia broke a ten
dav deadlock by agreeing on the sites for the
conference meetings.
Russia had demanded that at least half of the
foreign ministers' meetings be held in Red
territory. The Western representatives held to
their original proposal that all, or at least three
fourths, of the meetings be held on a site in
Western territory.
On Sunday morning the West compromised
its position and agreed to hold the meetings
alternately on West and on Red territory on a

half-and-half basis.
The compromise was justified. The selection
of the conference sites was obviously a minor
point in relation to the over-all significance of
the Berlin talks. On such a minor point, the
West did not "lose face" by its decision. Its
decision had the positive effect of increasing
the chances for the success of the conference
and reducing to some degree the intensity of
the cold war.
We are encouraged that the West has indi
cated this type of flexibility in its diplomatic
relations and that it is not intent on adhering
to a rigid "face-saving" type of diplomacy on
the thousand-and-one minor points which must
be faced in East-West negotiations.
