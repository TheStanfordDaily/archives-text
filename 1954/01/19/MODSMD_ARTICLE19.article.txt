## 'A Matter of Principle' 
### 
To the Editor:
The recent Ttonor Code controversy, concerning
whether or not examinations should be taken from
the test room, is, I think, much more a matter of
principle than of procedure. âœ“
The base tenet of the Honor Code is individual
integrity, the personal responsibility of the student
to himself. "I have neither given, received, nor
witnessed . . ' It is this statement, signed by the
student, which validates an examination paper. A
student is on hi honor not to cheat, and we assume
that the honor code works. If students are honest,
then what is the harm in taking examinations from
the test room?
Many classrooms are stuffy, overcrowded, the desks

are poor or lapboards must be used, and the atmos
phere, in general, may not be conducive to writing
a good examination. Many prefer to take an ex
amination in an empty or less crowded room, and,
if the Honor Code is to be kept, this should be their
privilege.
If one argues that staying in the same room re
duces the temptation to cheat, then one is immedi
ately questioning the personal integrity of the stu
dents. If this is the case, the Honor Code perhaps
should be given up, and proctors substituted in its
place. The very fact that restrictions are placed on
the Honor Code will render it, to a great extent,
pointless. If one's honor is to be trusted, then it
should be trusted without limitation.
