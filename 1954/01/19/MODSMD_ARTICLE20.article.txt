# New Guinness Hit Proves 'Pleasantly Immoral' Fable
## 
### TERRY COMITO 
"Captain's Paradise," currently at the Park in
Menlo, is a pleasantly immoral little fable about a
slightly schizophrenic ferry captain who happens to
have two wiv's. I is also another personal hit for

Alec Guinness.
In Gibraltar is Captain Henry
St. James' English home and wife,
his pipe, slippers, and boiled
dumplings. The- wife knits him
socks; he brines her little gifts
for the homo; and both always
go "beddy-bye" at ten o'clock.
Henry is the picture of slightly
dull respectability.
Things are a little different at
the other end of the ferry line

in the mythical North African port of Kalik. The
captain hero takes on the natty white suit, the droop
ing cigarette, and the sexy mistress of a rake. He
drinks, dancc -. -nd swims by moonlight with woman
number two until it is time to return to Gibraltar,
woman number one, and porridge for breakfast.
The captain's paradise, however, goes awry when
his Tionicliody wife in Gibralter begins to look for
greener U> I'ls, and iiis "love goddess" in Kalik
starts to yearn for tli" comforts of hearth and home.

This not particularly original situation is made to
come hilariously alive mostly by the not particularly
original idea of having Alec Guinness play the lead.
As Captain St. James, he is a prim, mild-mannered
scoundrel who moves with imperturbable logic
through a somewhat hysterical ar\fl highly illogical
world. The fact that Guinness has by now played
this part in several different pictures does not, what
ever may be its eventual effect on his career, detract
from the merit of his latest effort. It has, rather, led
to seeming perfection. He walks through the picture
with his faint satiric smile and air of detached aplomb
without seeming ever consciously to act.
He is aided by a wittily ironic script that gives
point to the somewhat farcical plot, a tongue-in
cheek direction that gets laughs out of details as
gruesome as circling vultures, and an excellent
supporting cast. To the role of Maud, the Gibraltar
wife, Celia Johnson brings a certain wistfillness
and even an unobtrusive pathos, Yvonne de Carlo,
playing herself with only slight exaggeration, is.
as the exotic Nita, surprisingly competent.
For all its many virtues, "Captain's Paradise" re
mains, however, a personal tour de force for Alec
Guinness. His personality, expert, urbane, and ironic,
saturates the picture and makes it irresi:; table.

"Captain's Paradise," currently at the Park in
Menlo, is a pleasantly immoral little fable about a
slightly schizophrenic ferry captain who happens to
have two wiv's. I is also another personal hit for

Alec Guinness.
In Gibraltar is Captain Henry
St. James' English home and wife,
his pipe, slippers, and boiled
dumplings. The- wife knits him
socks; he brines her little gifts
for the homo; and both always
go "beddy-bye" at ten o'clock.
Henry is the picture of slightly
dull respectability.
Things are a little different at
the other end of the ferry line

in the mythical North African port of Kalik. The
captain hero takes on the natty white suit, the droop
ing cigarette, and the sexy mistress of a rake. He
drinks, dancc -. -nd swims by moonlight with woman
number two until it is time to return to Gibraltar,
woman number one, and porridge for breakfast.
The captain's paradise, however, goes awry when
his Tionicliody wife in Gibralter begins to look for
greener U> I'ls, and iiis "love goddess" in Kalik
starts to yearn for tli" comforts of hearth and home.

This not particularly original situation is made to
come hilariously alive mostly by the not particularly
original idea of having Alec Guinness play the lead.
As Captain St. James, he is a prim, mild-mannered
scoundrel who moves with imperturbable logic
through a somewhat hysterical ar\fl highly illogical
world. The fact that Guinness has by now played
this part in several different pictures does not, what
ever may be its eventual effect on his career, detract
from the merit of his latest effort. It has, rather, led
to seeming perfection. He walks through the picture
with his faint satiric smile and air of detached aplomb
without seeming ever consciously to act.
He is aided by a wittily ironic script that gives
point to the somewhat farcical plot, a tongue-in
cheek direction that gets laughs out of details as
gruesome as circling vultures, and an excellent
supporting cast. To the role of Maud, the Gibraltar
wife, Celia Johnson brings a certain wistfillness
and even an unobtrusive pathos, Yvonne de Carlo,
playing herself with only slight exaggeration, is.
as the exotic Nita, surprisingly competent.
For all its many virtues, "Captain's Paradise" re
mains, however, a personal tour de force for Alec
Guinness. His personality, expert, urbane, and ironic,
saturates the picture and makes it irresi:; table.
