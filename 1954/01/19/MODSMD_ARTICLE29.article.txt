# Frosh Drop Two
## 
### BOB DURAND 
A hard - driving and experi
enced California freshman bas
ketball team took some of the
wind out of Stanford's sails last
weekend as Dick Clegg's Pa
pooses went down to defeat, 85-
C 4 on Friday, and 59-5G on Sat
urday.
The losses were the first of the
season for the Card frosh, who now
have won three and lost two.
In Friday night's game at the Pa
vilion, the Cal Cubs took an early
lead which they never relinquished
throughout the contest, although
their live- to six-point lead was
never safe until the final period
when they pulled away from the
tiring Stanfords and scored 27
markers to the latters' 12.
The winners were pared by
their high - scoring guard, Gabe
Arrillaga, who meshed six field
goals anil 15 free throws for 27
points. Kv 'McKeen, brother of
the varsity's Bob, also was high
with I!). The Blue & Gold held
an advantage under the bark
boards with McKeen and six
foot-six Joe Hagler controlling
the rebounds during the game.
Papoose Bill Bond played an ex
cellent game for the losing cause as
he led the Stanford cagers with 2J
points and an aggressive all-around
floor game. Denis Mahoney and 1 lap
Wagner accounted for 11 and 10
markers respectively.
AI Berkeley Saturday night, a
determined Stanford frosh five,
led by Bond and Mahoney,
jumped to an early first-quarter
lead of 15-12, only to fall behind
once again as the combined ef
forts of Cal's Hagler and Mike
Diaz sparked the Blue & Gold to
a 34-27 lead at intermission.
The second hall' saw the Papooses
slowly whittling away at the deficit,

with Bond and Mahoney again lead
ing the attack. With but a minute
and a Half to play in the game, sub
Carl Isaacs, playing -his best game
of the year, thrilled the crowd by
netting two quick field goals to tie
the score at 54-54. Cal's Diaz and
McKeen put the game on ice soon
after, however, by each scoring two
pointers.
Diaz led the Cubs with a game
high of 22 markers, while Mahoney
and Bond headed the Stanford scor
ing column with 16 and 14 respec
tively. Arrillaga, who had meshed
27 the previous night, was held to
only lour points.
Beppo Dyer, Dick Farman, and
Isaacs all contributed greatly to the
Papoose cause during the evening.
The lrosh will be looking for their
fourth win of the season Saturday
when they take on Washington High
School of San Francisco.

A hard - driving and experi
enced California freshman bas
ketball team took some of the
wind out of Stanford's sails last
weekend as Dick Clegg's Pa
pooses went down to defeat, 85-
C 4 on Friday, and 59-5G on Sat
urday.
The losses were the first of the
season for the Card frosh, who now
have won three and lost two.
In Friday night's game at the Pa
vilion, the Cal Cubs took an early
lead which they never relinquished
throughout the contest, although
their live- to six-point lead was
never safe until the final period
when they pulled away from the
tiring Stanfords and scored 27
markers to the latters' 12.
The winners were pared by
their high - scoring guard, Gabe
Arrillaga, who meshed six field
goals anil 15 free throws for 27
points. Kv 'McKeen, brother of
the varsity's Bob, also was high
with I!). The Blue & Gold held
an advantage under the bark
boards with McKeen and six
foot-six Joe Hagler controlling
the rebounds during the game.
Papoose Bill Bond played an ex
cellent game for the losing cause as
he led the Stanford cagers with 2J
points and an aggressive all-around
floor game. Denis Mahoney and 1 lap
Wagner accounted for 11 and 10
markers respectively.
AI Berkeley Saturday night, a
determined Stanford frosh five,
led by Bond and Mahoney,
jumped to an early first-quarter
lead of 15-12, only to fall behind
once again as the combined ef
forts of Cal's Hagler and Mike
Diaz sparked the Blue & Gold to
a 34-27 lead at intermission.
The second hall' saw the Papooses
slowly whittling away at the deficit,

with Bond and Mahoney again lead
ing the attack. With but a minute
and a Half to play in the game, sub
Carl Isaacs, playing -his best game
of the year, thrilled the crowd by
netting two quick field goals to tie
the score at 54-54. Cal's Diaz and
McKeen put the game on ice soon
after, however, by each scoring two
pointers.
Diaz led the Cubs with a game
high of 22 markers, while Mahoney
and Bond headed the Stanford scor
ing column with 16 and 14 respec
tively. Arrillaga, who had meshed
27 the previous night, was held to
only lour points.
Beppo Dyer, Dick Farman, and
Isaacs all contributed greatly to the
Papoose cause during the evening.
The lrosh will be looking for their
fourth win of the season Saturday
when they take on Washington High
School of San Francisco.
