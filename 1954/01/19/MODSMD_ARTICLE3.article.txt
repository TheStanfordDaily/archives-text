# Honor Code
## Persistence of Students Made the Plan a Reality 
### First of a Series) By BOB REZAK 
During the past year, and more particularly during the past week,
Stanford students have been informed about a problem that confronts
them mutually—a problem concerning the Honor Code. More specifically,
the problem deals with the question of whether or not students should
be allowed to take examinations out of the classroom.
Because it believes that any decision reached for solution will affect
its readers, The Daily believes they should be as fully informed as pos
sible with the facts of the issue.
With this idea in mind, The Daily assigned a member of its Editorial
Board to study the development of the Honor Code from its beginning in
1!)21 to the present time. This is the first of his reports.—Editor.

May 24, 1921, was considered
a rather special day from the
viewpoint of readers of the
Daily Palo Alto, the forerunner
of today's Stanford Daily. The
Peninsula's only morning
newspaper published its regu
lar amount of news and fea-

tures and advertisements, one
of which boldly announced
that Douglas Fairbanks was
starring in an epic called "The
Nut" at the Stanford Theater.
But sandwiched in among the
long columns of type, students no
ticed a story which particularly
excited them. It began:
"The Stanford faculty, acting
upon a petition from the students,
has approved the plan for an
honor system in examinations
throughout the University. The
honor system will be put into ef
fect in finals in July."
Thus ended a long struggle on
the part of students to convince
the University administration of
the need for an examination sys
tem based on personal honor and
integrity.
Actually, the work of establish
ing an honor system at Stanford
dates as far back as 1904, a time
when even student government was
non-existent. The impetus for such
a system came from students and
faculty members who felt that ex
amination proctoring was an af
front to student integrity.
In 1912 the University finally, but
cautiously, granted the student
body its first crack at self-govern
ment, but limited control over its
affairs by placing it under faculty
supervision.
President John Branner in 1915
appointed faculty members to act
as watchdogs over student com
mittees, and in the same year Da
vid Starr Jordan, then chancellor
of the University, declared stu
dent government was satisfactory
although its "chief weakness arises
from the lack of interest."
Students received Dr. Jordan's
statement as a challenge and
stepped up their demands for an
honor system.
Actually, a form of honor code
had been initiated by the Law
School before this time, and the
continued demand by students and
faculty in other departments re
sulted in the adoption of similar
systems. The failure of the History
Department to support, the move
ment, however, was considered a
setback, but many still continued
to suport the plan.
University work was disrupted
by the outbreak of World War I,
and, when peace finally was re
stored, veterans returning to the
campus strongly criticized cheating
in examinations. Their answer to
the cheating problem was an honor
system established and supported
by students. '
By 1921 student sentiment favor
ing such a system became more
outspoken and vigorous. Seven

teen-hundred students (then a
large proportion of the student
body) signed individual petitions
asking for complete responsibility
for honesty in academic work.
The Stanford Illustrated Re
view (now called The Stanford
Review) supported the students
and published a comparison of
the proctoring system at Harvard
and the honor system at Prince
ton. The magazine concluded that
"proctoring keeps the students
honest, the honor code makes
them honest."
The Daily Palo Alto similarly
appealed in behalf of the students
through its editorial columns.
Three months before the final
Honor Code was adopted, the
newspaper proclaimed:
"For many years there has ex
isted on the campus a realization
of the necessity for some kind of
system whereby Stanford men and
women would be responsible for
their own conduct and themselves
judge the misconduct of others.
"And today," the paper con
tinued, "that sentiment has crys
tallized into a student opinion that
stands 100 per cent for an honor
system."
The editorial prompted Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur to de
clare emphatically: "When stu
dents want an honor system bad
enough to ask for it, they can have
it."
And so the go-ahead signal was
given, and on May 24, 1921, the
Honor Code was established.
The system's basic plan differs

little from the plan now in opera
tion.
The Daily Palo Alto described
it in 1921 as meaning that "the
responsibility of the professors
hereafter ends with providing a
room where examinations may
be held without crowding, or also
providing alternate sets of ques
tions. The professor, after he has
answered inquiries, will with
draw Horn the room . .
Violations were to be reported
to students, and charges were to
be heard and penalties given by a
student-elected committee, subject
to appeal of the president of the
University.
The faculty, commented the
Daily Palo Alto, had thus given
the students the handling of all
matters of discipline in the stu
dent body, subject only to review
by the president.
The Honor Code was readily ac
cepted throughout the campus and
rapidly became an integral part of
student life.
President Wilbur, in evaluating
the effect of the code, once ob
served thai (he code had worked
because it was a "system within
a system."
"The code would have failed,"
he added, "if the initiative had
not been placed with the students.
Within the resulting development,
of mental character lies the sys
tem's strength."

Students received Dr. Jordan's

stepped up their demands for an
honor system.
Actually, a form of honor code
had been initiated by the Law

continued demand by students and
faculty in other departments re

systems. The failure of the History
Department to support, the move

setback, but many still continued
to suport the plan.
University work was disrupted
by the outbreak of World War I,
and, when peace finally was re
stored, veterans returning to the
campus strongly criticized cheating
in examinations. Their answer to
the cheating problem was an honor
system established and supported
by students. '
By 1921 student sentiment favor
ing such a system became more
outspoken and vigorous. Seven

teen-hundred students (then a
large proportion of the student
body) signed individual petitions
asking for complete responsibility
for honesty in academic work.
The Stanford Illustrated Re
view (now called The Stanford
Review) supported the students
and published a comparison of
the proctoring system at Harvard
and the honor system at Prince
ton. The magazine concluded that
"proctoring keeps the students
honest, the honor code makes
them honest."
The Daily Palo Alto similarly
appealed in behalf of the students
through its editorial columns.
Three months before the final
Honor Code was adopted, the
newspaper proclaimed:
"For many years there has ex
isted on the campus a realization
of the necessity for some kind of
system whereby Stanford men and
women would be responsible for
their own conduct and themselves
judge the misconduct of others.
"And today," the paper con
tinued, "that sentiment has crys
tallized into a student opinion that
stands 100 per cent for an honor
system."
The editorial prompted Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur to de
clare emphatically: "When stu
dents want an honor system bad
enough to ask for it, they can have
it."
And so the go-ahead signal was
given, and on May 24, 1921, the
Honor Code was established.
The system's basic plan differs

little from the plan now in opera
tion.
The Daily Palo Alto described
it in 1921 as meaning that "the
responsibility of the professors
hereafter ends with providing a
room where examinations may
be held without crowding, or also
providing alternate sets of ques
tions. The professor, after he has
answered inquiries, will with
draw Horn the room . .
Violations were to be reported
to students, and charges were to
be heard and penalties given by a
student-elected committee, subject
to appeal of the president of the
University.
The faculty, commented the
Daily Palo Alto, had thus given
the students the handling of all
matters of discipline in the stu
dent body, subject only to review
by the president.
The Honor Code was readily ac
cepted throughout the campus and
rapidly became an integral part of
student life.
President Wilbur, in evaluating
the effect of the code, once ob

"The code would have failed,"
he added, "if the initiative had

During the past year, and more particularly during the past week,
Stanford students have been informed about a problem that confronts
them mutually—a problem concerning the Honor Code. More specifically,
the problem deals with the question of whether or not students should
be allowed to take examinations out of the classroom.
Because it believes that any decision reached for solution will affect
its readers, The Daily believes they should be as fully informed as pos
sible with the facts of the issue.
With this idea in mind, The Daily assigned a member of its Editorial
Board to study the development of the Honor Code from its beginning in
1!)21 to the present time. This is the first of his reports.—Editor.

May 24, 1921, was considered
a rather special day from the
viewpoint of readers of the
Daily Palo Alto, the forerunner
of today's Stanford Daily. The
Peninsula's only morning
newspaper published its regu
lar amount of news and fea-

tures and advertisements, one
of which boldly announced
that Douglas Fairbanks was
starring in an epic called "The
Nut" at the Stanford Theater.
But sandwiched in among the
long columns of type, students no
ticed a story which particularly
excited them. It began:
"The Stanford faculty, acting
upon a petition from the students,
has approved the plan for an
honor system in examinations
throughout the University. The
honor system will be put into ef
fect in finals in July."
Thus ended a long struggle on

JOHN BRANNER
—He favored limited control
During the past year, and more particularly during the past week,
Stanford students have been informed about a problem that confronts
them mutually—a problem concerning the Honor Code. More specifically,
the problem deals with the question of whether or not students should
be allowed to take examinations out of the classroom.
Because it believes that any decision reached for solution will affect
its readers, The Daily believes they should be as fully informed as pos
sible with the facts of the issue.
With this idea in mind, The Daily assigned a member of its Editorial
Board to study the development of the Honor Code from its beginning in
1!)21 to the present time. This is the first of his reports.—Editor.

May 24, 1921, was considered
a rather special day from the
viewpoint of readers of the
Daily Palo Alto, the forerunner
of today's Stanford Daily. The
Peninsula's only morning
newspaper published its regu
lar amount of news and fea-

tures and advertisements, one
of which boldly announced
that Douglas Fairbanks was
starring in an epic called "The
Nut" at the Stanford Theater.
But sandwiched in among the
long columns of type, students no
ticed a story which particularly
excited them. It began:
"The Stanford faculty, acting
upon a petition from the students,
has approved the plan for an
honor system in examinations
throughout the University. The
honor system will be put into ef
fect in finals in July."
Thus ended a long struggle on
the part of students to convince
the University administration of
the need for an examination sys
tem based on personal honor and
integrity.
Actually, the work of establish
ing an honor system at Stanford
dates as far back as 1904, a time
when even student government was
non-existent. The impetus for such
a system came from students and
faculty members who felt that ex
amination proctoring was an af
front to student integrity.
In 1912 the University finally, but
cautiously, granted the student
body its first crack at self-govern
ment, but limited control over its
affairs by placing it under faculty
supervision.
President John Branner in 1915
appointed faculty members to act
as watchdogs over student com
mittees, and in the same year Da
vid Starr Jordan, then chancellor
of the University, declared stu
dent government was satisfactory
although its "chief weakness arises
from the lack of interest."
Students received Dr. Jordan's
statement as a challenge and
stepped up their demands for an
honor system.
Actually, a form of honor code
had been initiated by the Law
School before this time, and the
continued demand by students and
faculty in other departments re
sulted in the adoption of similar
systems. The failure of the History
Department to support, the move
ment, however, was considered a
setback, but many still continued
to suport the plan.
University work was disrupted
by the outbreak of World War I,
and, when peace finally was re
stored, veterans returning to the
campus strongly criticized cheating
in examinations. Their answer to
the cheating problem was an honor
system established and supported
by students. '
By 1921 student sentiment favor
ing such a system became more
outspoken and vigorous. Seven

teen-hundred students (then a
large proportion of the student
body) signed individual petitions
asking for complete responsibility
for honesty in academic work.
The Stanford Illustrated Re
view (now called The Stanford
Review) supported the students
and published a comparison of
the proctoring system at Harvard
and the honor system at Prince
ton. The magazine concluded that
"proctoring keeps the students
honest, the honor code makes
them honest."
The Daily Palo Alto similarly
appealed in behalf of the students
through its editorial columns.
Three months before the final
Honor Code was adopted, the
newspaper proclaimed:
"For many years there has ex
isted on the campus a realization
of the necessity for some kind of
system whereby Stanford men and
women would be responsible for
their own conduct and themselves
judge the misconduct of others.
"And today," the paper con
tinued, "that sentiment has crys
tallized into a student opinion that
stands 100 per cent for an honor
system."
The editorial prompted Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur to de
clare emphatically: "When stu
dents want an honor system bad
enough to ask for it, they can have
it."
And so the go-ahead signal was
given, and on May 24, 1921, the
Honor Code was established.
The system's basic plan differs

little from the plan now in opera
tion.
