# Card Matmen Down Gators
## 
### 
The Stanford varsity wrestling
team, though plagued by the loss of
four first-string men through injury
and ineligibility, won its second
straight match of the season when
it downed the San Francisco State
squad, 23-10, Friday.
Pins were garnered by 'Dan Cor
tes and Bob Fisher, while George
Russell and Bob Spencer each won
decisions. Ken James earned a
draw, and the final five points were
gained when State forfeited the 137-
pound class.
Bob Beatie, regular 167-pounder,
moved up to the 177 class and lost
a close decision to his opponent,
while Pete Pierce moved to the
heavyweight class and was pinned
by a man who was 50 pounds heav
ier. j
In two exhibition matches, Stan
ford's Pete Likens and Jim Hutch
inson each pinned their opponents
in the first period.
This coming Friday, the varsity
takes on the ever-dangerous Cali
fornia Polytechnic team at 2 p.m. in
the Pavilion.
