# Trackmen Look Sharp
## 
### LEE HANSEN 
Fall quarter marked the begin
ning of workouts for Coach Jack
Weiershauser's 90 trackmen. By the
date of their first meet, March 27
with Fresno State, each of the
speedsters will have spent at least
120 hours out on the track oval.
It is this determination, in
Coach Weiei ihauser's words, that
will lessen the blow of losing such
great competitors as Bob Mathias,
Howard Hertz, Chuck Renfro,
Bob Simon, and Nason Fishback.
On hand this year, such outstand
ing performers as miler Boh Reed,
hurdler (Jerry Wood, high jump
er John Stewart, and shot putter
A 1 Cheney will also help cushion
the shock.
An early-season standout in the
dashes is Keith Brownsberger, a re
turning junior. Placing in the state
meet while in high school, Browns
berger has steadily improved to his
last season's best of 9.8 in the 100
and 21.4 in the 220.
In the 440, returning senior Fred
George is an important prospect
with a 47.8 to his credit. George
won the Big Meet and took second
in the PCC meet last year.
An ineligible transfer from Cal
Tech last season, Larry Spicer is
expected to be outstanding in the
half-mile.
Strongest events so far seem to be
the mile and two-mile. Possibly the
outstanding man on the team, Bob
Reed is expected to shine in both.
With a 4:18 mile plus a 9:25 two
mile, Reed should prove a great
asset to the team.
Other outstanding two - milers
are transfer Chuck Strong, who
has a 9:33 best; Russ Ferguson,
close behind with a 9:36; and
Ralph Love, with both a 4:22 mile
and a 9:44 two-mile.
Depth will also make the relay

| one of the Indians' strongest events.
Such men as Walt Garrett, Keith
Brownsberger, Bill Rupp, Gerry
Wood, Myron Hollister, and Fred
George will be vying for positions.
All of them are capable of a 49.0
quarter or better.
Hurdle men Jim Luttrell and
Gerry Wood are both good bets.
Luttrell, a sophomore, set a new
Stanford freshman mark of 23.8 in
the lows last year. Wood, a senior,
was outstanding in the highs last
year, taking fourth in the NCAA
meet.
In the field events, less strength
is indicated. Broad jump hopes
are centered in Loren Sorensen
and Jim Seebald, both juniors,
with better than 23 ft. to their
credit.
John Stewart, a sophomore, who
set a new Stanford freshman
mark of 6 ft. 6% in. in the high
jump, will lead the scoring there.
Norman Giles, a junior returning
after two years in the Navy, may
prove to be a dark horse. He has

done 6 ft. 5 in.
Sophomore Bill Flint is a proba
bility in the pole vault with a pre
vious mark of 12 ft. 6 in.
Throws of 145 ft. in practice in
dicate Bob Kimball as the man to
watch in the discus. Kimball should
also be outstanding in the javelin,
having taken third in the national
last year. Another spearman, Leo
Long, should prove equally as
strong, having taken fourth in the
nationals.
Menlo transfer A 1 Cheney will
take the top spot among the shot
put men. He has been putting
around 50 ft.
According to Coach Weiershau
ser, the gates are not closed and
more prospects are needed in all
events.

All of them are capable of a 49.0
quarter or better.
Hurdle men Jim Luttrell and
Gerry Wood are both good bets.
Luttrell, a sophomore, set a new
Stanford freshman mark of 23.8 in
the lows last year. Wood, a senior,
was outstanding in the highs last
year, taking fourth in the NCAA
meet.
In the field events, less strength
is indicated. Broad jump hopes
are centered in Loren Sorensen
and Jim Seebald, both juniors,
with better than 23 ft. to their
credit.
John Stewart, a sophomore, who
set a new Stanford freshman
mark of 6 ft. 6% in. in the high
jump, will lead the scoring there.
Norman Giles, a junior returning
after two years in the Navy, may
prove to be a dark horse. He has

done 6 ft. 5 in.
Sophomore Bill Flint is a proba
bility in the pole vault with a pre
vious mark of 12 ft. 6 in.
Throws of 145 ft. in practice in
dicate Bob Kimball as the man to
watch in the discus. Kimball should
also be outstanding in the javelin,
having taken third in the national
last year. Another spearman, Leo
Long, should prove equally as
strong, having taken fourth in the
nationals.
Menlo transfer A 1 Cheney will
take the top spot among the shot
put men. He has been putting
around 50 ft.
According to Coach Weiershau
ser, the gates are not closed and
more prospects are needed in all
events.
Fall quarter marked the begin
ning of workouts for Coach Jack
Weiershauser's 90 trackmen. By the
date of their first meet, March 27
with Fresno State, each of the
speedsters will have spent at least
120 hours out on the track oval.
It is this determination, in
Coach Weiei ihauser's words, that
will lessen the blow of losing such
great competitors as Bob Mathias,
Howard Hertz, Chuck Renfro,
Bob Simon, and Nason Fishback.
On hand this year, such outstand
ing performers as miler Boh Reed,
hurdler (Jerry Wood, high jump
er John Stewart, and shot putter
A 1 Cheney will also help cushion
the shock.
An early-season standout in the
dashes is Keith Brownsberger, a re
turning junior. Placing in the state
meet while in high school, Browns
berger has steadily improved to his
last season's best of 9.8 in the 100
and 21.4 in the 220.
In the 440, returning senior Fred
George is an important prospect
with a 47.8 to his credit. George
won the Big Meet and took second
in the PCC meet last year.
An ineligible transfer from Cal
Tech last season, Larry Spicer is
expected to be outstanding in the
half-mile.
Strongest events so far seem to be
the mile and two-mile. Possibly the
outstanding man on the team, Bob
Reed is expected to shine in both.
With a 4:18 mile plus a 9:25 two
mile, Reed should prove a great
asset to the team.
Other outstanding two - milers
are transfer Chuck Strong, who
has a 9:33 best; Russ Ferguson,
close behind with a 9:36; and
Ralph Love, with both a 4:22 mile
and a 9:44 two-mile.
Depth will also make the relay

| one of the Indians' strongest events.
Such men as Walt Garrett, Keith
Brownsberger, Bill Rupp, Gerry
Wood, Myron Hollister, and Fred
George will be vying for positions.
All of them are capable of a 49.0
quarter or better.
