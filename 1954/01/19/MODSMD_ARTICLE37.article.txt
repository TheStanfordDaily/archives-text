# Braves Split With Blues
## 
### RAY WADDINGTON 
Coach George Lynn's Stan
ford Braves broke even with
their arch-rivals, the Cal Blues,
over the weekend as they won
convincingly, 62-46, Friday af
ternoon, then lost just as con
vincingly Saturday by a 47-65
margin.
In Friday's local game at the Pa
vilion the Braves completely out-
I played Cal during the first half,
j They scored first on a fast break,
| then settled down to a slower,
I steady pace, building up a substan
! tial lead.
Utilizing a full court press on de
fense, the Braves held Cal scoreless
for six and one-half minutes of the
first quarter. By the time Cal did
I break into the scoring Stanford had
j built up such an imposing lead that
Lynn started running in all his re
serves, who seemed to do just as
l well as the regulars.
Bob McGrath and Paul Perko
I contributed nine points each in the
first half. The Indians walked off
the court at half-time with a 37-14
i lead.
Cal caine hack in the second
half with a desperate hid to get
hark in the game. The Braves,
relaxed and confident, allowed the

Blues, who were pared hy guard
Al Winelrub, to score more free
ly. Stanford led 4G-27 at the end
of the third quarter, and rousted
through the la>>t period easily to
win G2-4G.
John Hendricks took scoring hon
ors for the game with 13 points. *
In Saturdays match at Berkeley
the Blues grabbed the lead early in
the game and proved they were de
termined to hold on to it. The
Stanfordites appeared to be unable
to hit the basket.
Spearheaded by Dave Dunn, the
Braves made their best bid for vic
tory in the second quarter, and
went briefly into the lead. However,
the Blues bounced back with six
baskets in a row to quell the insur
rection. The half-time score read:
Cal 33, Braves 24.
One bright spot in the Stanford
playing was the hoard work of
forward Carlos Bea. Bea's bril
liant rebound plays did much to
keep Stanford in the game.
Cal was out in front 52-37 at
the end of the third period and
had clear sailing for the rest of
the game. Final: G5-47.

margin.
In Friday's local game at the Pa
vilion the Braves completely out-
I played Cal during the first half,
j They scored first on a fast break,
| then settled down to a slower,
I steady pace, building up a substan
! tial lead.
Utilizing a full court press on de
fense, the Braves held Cal scoreless
for six and one-half minutes of the
first quarter. By the time Cal did
I break into the scoring Stanford had
j built up such an imposing lead that
Lynn started running in all his re
serves, who seemed to do just as
l well as the regulars.
Bob McGrath and Paul Perko
I contributed nine points each in the
first half. The Indians walked off
the court at half-time with a 37-14
i lead.
Cal caine hack in the second
half with a desperate hid to get
hark in the game. The Braves,
relaxed and confident, allowed the

Blues, who were pared hy guard
Al Winelrub, to score more free
ly. Stanford led 4G-27 at the end
of the third quarter, and rousted
through the la>>t period easily to
win G2-4G.
John Hendricks took scoring hon
ors for the game with 13 points. *
In Saturdays match at Berkeley
the Blues grabbed the lead early in
the game and proved they were de
termined to hold on to it. The
Stanfordites appeared to be unable
to hit the basket.
Spearheaded by Dave Dunn, the
Braves made their best bid for vic
tory in the second quarter, and
went briefly into the lead. However,
the Blues bounced back with six
baskets in a row to quell the insur
rection. The half-time score read:
Cal 33, Braves 24.
One bright spot in the Stanford
playing was the hoard work of
forward Carlos Bea. Bea's bril
liant rebound plays did much to
keep Stanford in the game.
Cal was out in front 52-37 at
the end of the third period and
had clear sailing for the rest of
the game. Final: G5-47.
