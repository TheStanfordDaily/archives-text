# THE 						DU PONT DIGEST
## Plant Development Offers Training and Opportunity 
### 
A young chemical engineer recently
hod his first assignment in a Plant
Development group at Du Pont. He
was part of a team assigned to im
prove recovery of adipic acid, a nylon
intermediate, from plant-waste
streams.
First, he made a literature survey
for possible leads. Three recovery
meth(xls came under consideration:
solvent extraction, crystallization, and
a combination distillation •crystalliza
tion process. He helped to set up a
laboratory program to compare and
evaluate them.
Preliminary results were somewhat
inconclusive. It was derided to go

ahead with semi works tests, while
nn organic chemist completer! the
laboratory work.
Next, the young chemical engineer
joined forces with a mechanical engi
neer to design a semi-works plant to
evaluate each method. In this plant,
nil vital points were checked and re
checked: materials of construction,
steam and water requirements, heat
transfer coefficients, yields, product
quality, and pollution problems.
The semi-works data revealed that
the distillation-crystallization process
was the most economical, and also
gave the l)est produet quality. Usual
ly, the next step would l>e construc-

lion and operation of a pilot plant.
But this time, engineers from the
Production Division arranged for a
limited-scale plant test, using a spare
batch still and a crystallizer on a
part-time b;isis. Two months of test
ing confirmed the previous data —the
i lew distillution -crystallizat ion process
recovered adipic acid efficiently, and
would reduce costs considerably. The
plant is now using this process suc
cessfully.
That's how one young chemical
engineer started his career ina typical
Du Pont Plant l)ei>rlopmvnt group.
The job of such groups is to make
processes and equipment more effi
cient , to adapt product s to new uses,
and to improve product quality.
Plant Development work not only
offers opportunity in itself but valu
able training for other fields.
