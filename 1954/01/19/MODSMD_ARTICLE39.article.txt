LETTING GO—(left) Adriano Garsia, a qualified member of the
Alpine Club, stands in the creek bed, pulling the rope which
causes the log (used in practices instead of a man) to be released.


WHAT A STRAIN (center) —Martin Johnson, another qualified
member of the club, performs the dynamic belay which stops
the falling log. He is anchored to a tree by the taut rope fold
ing him from behind. This keeps him from being pulled off his
feet when the log is released. He is stopping the fall by slowly
bringing the rope in his hands (which is attached to the log) to
a stop. The Alpine Club held their quarterly dynamic belay
practice at San Francisquito Creek last Saturday morning. De
spite the rain, about 20 climbers, both older members and be
ginners, were there. Jack Maling, president of the club, re
marked, "It was the smoothest dynamic belay practice we've
had." The dynamic belay is a technigue used to stop the fall of
the leader with as little force as possible on the rope, belayer,
and leader.


DYNAMIC BEI.AY PRACTICE — The belayer (right) stands
above the creek bed and attempts to stop the log as it plummets
downward after being released by a man standing in the creek
bed and controlling the line which trips the hook and releases
the log. The Club used to use "live bait" instead of logs in
this maneuver, but stopped after victims began to complain of
sudden let-downs.
