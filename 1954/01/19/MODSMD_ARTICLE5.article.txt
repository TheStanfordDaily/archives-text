### EDA MENDELS 
The importance and achievement of the less-publicized United
Nations committees on social welfare and economics v/as the main
theme of Mrs. Oswald B. Lord's address last night.
Mrs. Lord, U.S. representative to the U.N. Commission on Hu
man Rights, spoke at Memorial Auditorium on the topic "The U.N.

Cuts the Price of Peace."
Mrs. Lord, who has traveled ex
tensively for the U.N. International
Children's Emergency Fund, lauded
the advances made in prevention of
epidemics and general health stand
ards in many parts of the world.
She commented especially on the
active battle against tuberculosis,
malaria, and yaws.
Mrs. Lord described the
"watchdog system," a thrice-daily
broadcast bulletin from Geneva,
Switzerland, reporting cases of
dangerous communicable diseases
wherever they occur, thus alert
ing public health officers every
where.
She spoke fluently and enthusias
tically of the accomplishments of
the technical assistance program,
calling it a way "to show these peo
ple how to help themseslves."
She cited Afghanistan as a case in
point. "Fourteen nations have ex
perts working in Afghanistan, and
the country has doubled production
and achieved five times the agricul
tural output."
Mrs. Lord pointed out that the
is definitely deriving bene
, lits from her friendly associations
in the U.N.
The U.S., which used to purchase
the major portion of manganese for
the production of steel from Russia,
now has to depend on India for her
supply of that essential mineral, and
is developing sources in South
America, the U.N. official added.
In her review of the highlights of
last year's session of the U.N., Mrs.
Lord mentioned children's welfare,
technical assistance, refugee aid,
prisoner of war arrangements, the
declaration making Puerto Rico a
commonwealth, and President Ei
senhower's suggestions on atomic
power.
The ,<{iay-haired delegate gave
some concise, piquant sidelights
on her associates in the U.N.,
bringing chuckles to the audi
ence.
Mrs. Lord advanced and refuted
the popular misconception that the
U.N. costs too much and is a burden
to the U.S. taxpayer. She contrasted
the contribution of H2 cents per per
son to the U.N. during the fiscal
year to the $40 per person
tpenl for military purposes.
In the question period which fol
lower! the formal speech, Mrs. Lord
was asked why the U.S. has not
endorsed the Declaration of Human
Rights. She replied that its empha
sis on the guarantee of social and
economic rights like work and free
medical care was at variance with
U.S. ideate.
